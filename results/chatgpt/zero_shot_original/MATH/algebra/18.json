    "solution": "Let $t,s,g$ be the weight of one treek, the weight of one squig, and the weight of one goolee, respectively. Then the given information tells us \\begin{align*}\n10t &=3s+g\\\\\n2t +g &= s.\n\\end{align*} Since we would like to solve for $s$ in terms of $t$, we want to eliminate $g$. Add the two equations to obtain \\begin{align*}\n10t+2t+g &= 3s+g+s\\\\\n\\Rightarrow 10t+2t &= 3s+s\\\\\n\\Rightarrow 4s &= 12t\\\\\n\\Rightarrow s &=3t.\n\\end{align*} So one squig weighs $\\boxed{3}$ treeks.",

        "To solve this problem, we need to express the weight relationships between treeks, squigs, and goolees using algebraic equations.\nLet's denote:\n- \\( T \\) as the weight of one treek,\n- \\( S \\) as the weight of one squig,\n- \\( G \\) as the weight of one goolee.\nWe are given two equations based on the problem statement:\n1. Ten treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee:\n   \\[\n   10T = 3S + G\n   \\]\n2. Two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig:\n   \\[\n   2T + G = S\n   \\]\nWe need to find the combined weight of how many treeks equals the weight of one squig. In other words, we want to find \\( n \\) such that:\n\\[\nnT = S\n\\]\nNow, let's solve the equations step by step:\nFrom the second equation:\n\\[\nG = S - 2T\n\\]\nSubstitute \\( G = S - 2T \\) into the first equation:\n\\[\n10T = 3S + (S - 2T)\n\\]\nSimplifying:\n\\[\n10T = 4S - 2T\n\\]\nAdd \\( 2T \\) to both sides to eliminate the \\(-2T\\) on the right:\n\\[\n12T = 4S\n\\]\nDivide both sides by 4 to solve for \\( S \\) in terms of \\( T \\):\n\\[\n3T = S\n\\]\nTherefore, the combined weight of 3 treeks equals the weight of one squig. So, the answer is that 3 treeks weigh the same as 1 squig.",
