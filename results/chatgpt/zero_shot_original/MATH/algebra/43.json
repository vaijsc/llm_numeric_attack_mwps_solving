    "solution": "The store's revenue is given by: number of books sold $\\times$ price of each book, or $p(128-4p)=128p-4p^2$. We want to maximize this expression by completing the square. We can factor out a $-4$ to get $-4(p^2-32p)$.\n\nTo complete the square, we add $(32/2)^2=256$ inside the parentheses and subtract $-4\\cdot256=-1024$ outside. We are left with the expression\n\\[-4(p^2-32p+256)+1024=-4(p-16)^2+1024.\\]Note that the $-4(p-16)^2$ term will always be nonpositive since the perfect square is always nonnegative. Thus, the revenue is maximized when $-4(p-16)^2$ equals 0, which is when $p=16$. Thus, the store should charge $\\boxed{16}$ dollars for the book.\n\nAlternatively, since the roots of $p(128-4p)$ are 0 and 32, symmetry tells us that the extreme value will be at $p=16$.  Since the coefficient on $p^2$ is negative, this is a maximum.",

        "To determine the optimal price to maximize revenue, we need to consider the relationship between price and the number of books sold. The store's research indicates that if the book's price is \\( p \\) dollars, then the number of books sold per month is \\( 128 - 4p \\).\nThe revenue \\( R \\) generated can be expressed as a function of the price \\( p \\):\n\\[\nR(p) = \\text{(Price per book)} \\times \\text{(Number of books sold)}\n\\]\n\\[\nR(p) = p \\times (128 - 4p)\n\\]\n\\[\nR(p) = 128p - 4p^2\n\\]\nTo find the price \\( p \\) that maximizes this revenue, we need to find the vertex of the quadratic function \\( R(p) = -4p^2 + 128p \\). The coefficient of \\( p^2 \\) is negative, confirming that the parabola opens downwards, and thus the vertex represents the maximum point.\nThe formula for the vertex \\( p \\) of a quadratic function \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\) is given by:\n\\[\np = -\\frac{b}{2a}\n\\]\nIn our function, \\( a = -4 \\) and \\( b = 128 \\). Plugging in these values, we get:\n\\[\np = -\\frac{128}{2 \\times -4} = -\\frac{128}{-8} = 16\n\\]\nTherefore, the store should charge $16 per book to maximize its revenue. To check this within the constraint \\( p \\le 32 \\), we see that 16 is less than 32, which satisfies the constraint. Thus, the optimal price to charge is $16 to ensure maximum revenue.",
        "To determine the price that maximizes revenue, we first need to express the revenue in terms of the price, \\( p \\).\n1. **Define the revenue function:**\n   The revenue \\( R \\) is given by the product of the price \\( p \\) and the number of books sold.
