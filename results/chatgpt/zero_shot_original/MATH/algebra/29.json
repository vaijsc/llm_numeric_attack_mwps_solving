We know that $\\alpha\\beta = 48$, and $\\alpha/\\beta = 3 \\implies \\alpha = 3\\beta$.\n\nSo $ b = -\\alpha - \\beta = -4\\beta$. To maximize $b$, we want to make $\\beta$ negative and as large as possible. Given the relationship that $\\alpha = 3\\beta$ and that $\\alpha*\\beta = 48$, we see that $\\beta = 4$ or $-4$. Clearly $-4$ maximizes $b$, and $b = \\boxed{16}$.",

        "To find the largest possible value of \\( b \\) for which the solutions of the quadratic equation \\( x^2 + bx + 48 = 0 \\) are in the ratio 3:1, let's proceed step-by-step.\nLet's denote the roots of the quadratic equation as \\( 3k \\) and \\( k \\), where the ratio of the roots is 3:1.\nAccording to Vi\u00e8te's formulas, for a quadratic equation \\( x^2 + bx + c = 0 \\):\n- The sum of the roots is given by \\( -b \\).\n- The product of the roots is \\( c \\).\nFor our specific equation:\n\\[ 3k + k = -b \\]\n\\[ 3k \\times k = 48 \\]\nFrom the second equation for the product of the roots:\n\\[\n3k^2 = 48\n\\]\nSolving for \\( k^2 \\), we get:\n\\[\nk^2 = \\frac{48}{3} = 16\n\\]\nSo, \\( k = \\sqrt{16} = 4 \\).\nNow, substituting \\( k = 4 \\) into the equation for the sum of the roots:\n\\[\n3k + k = -b \\Rightarrow 3(4) + 4 = -b\n\\]\n\\[\n12 + 4 = -b\n\\]\n\\[\n16 = -b\n\\]\n\\[\nb = -16\n\\]\nSo the value of \\( b \\) is \\(-16\\). Since we are asked for the largest possible value of \\( b \\), and \\(-16\\) satisfies both equations for the roots 12 and 4 in the ratio 3:1, the result is verified.\nThe largest possible value of \\( b \\) is \\(\\boxed{-16}\\).",
        "To solve this problem, we need to determine the values of \\( b \\) such that the solutions of the quadratic equation \\( x^2 + bx + 48 = 0 \\) are in a 3:1 ratio. Let's denote the solutions of the equation by \\( 3k \\) and \\( k \\), where \\( k \\) is a positive number.\nThe sum of the roots of a quadratic equation \\( x^2 + bx + c = 0 \\) is given by \\(-b\\), and the product of the roots is the constant term \\( c \\). For our equation, the sum of the roots is:\n\\[\n3k + k = 4k\n\\]\nand the product of the roots is:\n\\[\n3k \\times k = 3k^2\n\\]\nAccording to Vieta's formulas, we have:\n1. \\( 4k = -b \\)\n2. \\( 3k^2 = 48 \\)\nFrom the second equation, solve for \\( k^2 \\):\n\\[\nk^2 = \\frac{48}{3} = 16\n\\]\nTaking the square root of both sides gives the positive value of \\( k \\) (since roots are positive):\n\\[\nk = 4\n\\]\nSubstitute \\( k = 4 \\) into the equation for the sum of roots:\n\\[\n4k = -b \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 4 \\times 4 = -b \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 16 = -b \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad b = -16\n\\]\nSince we are asked for the largest possible value of \\( b \\), let's consider the second set of roots where \\( 3k \\) and \\( k \\) could be negative with the same ratio. Let the roots be \\(-3k\\) and \\(-k\\):\nThe new sum of roots is:\n\\[\n-3k - k = -4k\n\\]\nThe new product of roots is:\n\\[\n(-3k)(-k) = 3k^2\n\\]\nSo the equations remain the same:\n1. \\(-4k = -b\\)\n2. \\(3k^2 = 48\\)\nFrom these, since \\( k^2 = 16 \\) was already solved, and \\( k = 4 \\), then:\n\\[\n-4k = -b \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad -4 \\times 4 = -b \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad -16 = -b \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad b = 16\n\\]\nThus, the setup with negative roots yields \\( b = 16 \\).\nThe largest possible value of \\( b \\) is \\(\\boxed{16}\\).",
