    "solution": "Let the two numbers be $x$ and $x + 2$, where $x$ is even. We want to find $x + (x + 2) = 2x + 2$, and we are told that $(x + 2)^2 - x^2 = 60$.

        "To solve this problem, let's denote the two consecutive positive even numbers as \\( x \\) and \\( x + 2 \\). The problem states that we square both numbers and find the difference of the squares to be 60. Mathematically, this is represented by the equation:\n\\[\n(x + 2)^2 - x^2 = 60\n\\]\nWe need to expand and simplify the equation:\n1. Expand \\( (x + 2)^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   (x + 2)^2 = x^2 + 4x + 4\n   \\]\n2. Substitute this back into the equation:\n   \\[\n   (x^2 + 4x + 4) - x^2 = 60\n   \\]\n3. Simplify the equation by canceling out \\( x^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   4x + 4 = 60\n   \\]\n4. Subtract 4 from both sides:\n   \\[\n   4x = 56\n   \\]\n5. Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   x = 14\n   \\]\nNow that we have \\( x = 14 \\), we can determine the two consecutive even numbers: 14 and \\( 14 + 2 = 16 \\).\nFinally, find the sum of the two numbers:\n\\[\n14 + 16 = 30\n\\]\nTherefore, the sum of the original two numbers is \\(\\boxed{30}\\).",
        "To solve the problem, we need to determine the original two consecutive positive even numbers and then find their sum. Let's denote the first even number as \\( x \\). Since the numbers are consecutive even numbers, the next even number will be \\( x + 2 \\).\nNow, let's square both numbers and express their squares:\n- The square of the first even number \\( x \\) is \\( x^2 \\).\n- The square of the second even number \\( x + 2 \\) is \\( (x + 2)^2 \\).\nAccording to the problem, the difference of these squares is 60. So, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[\n(x + 2)^2 - x^2 = 60\n\\]\nWe can expand \\( (x + 2)^2 \\):\n\\[\n(x + 2)^2 = x^2 + 4x + 4\n\\]\nSubstituting into the equation gives:\n\\[\n(x^2 + 4x + 4) - x^2 = 60\n\\]\nSimplifying by removing \\( x^2 \\) from both sides, we get:\n\\[\n4x + 4 = 60\n\\]\nNext, subtract 4 from both sides:\n\\[\n4x = 56\n\\]\nDivide both sides by 4 to solve for \\( x \\):\n\\[\nx = 14\n\\]\nThus, the two consecutive even numbers are 14 and 16. We now find the sum of these two numbers:\n\\[\n14 + 16 = 30\n\\]\nTherefore, the sum of the original two numbers is \\( \\boxed{30} \\).",
