        "To solve the equation \\((3^k)^6 = 3^6\\), we can use the property of exponents:\n\\[\n(a^m)^n = a^{m \\cdot n}\n\\]\nIn this case, we have \\(a = 3\\), \\(m = k\\), and \\(n = 6\\). Applying this property, we get:\n\\[\n(3^k)^6 = 3^{k \\cdot 6}\n\\]\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\\[\n3^{k \\cdot 6} = 3^6\n\\]\nSince the bases (3) are equal, the exponents must be equal for the equation to hold. Therefore, we have:\n\\[\nk \\cdot 6 = 6\n\\]\nTo find \\(k\\), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:\n\\[\nk = \\frac{6}{6} = 1\n\\]\nThus, the value of \\(k\\) is \\(\\boxed{1}\\).",
        "To find \\( k \\) given the equation \\((3^k)^6 = 3^6\\), we can apply properties of exponents. Here are the steps to solve the equation:\n1. **Apply the Power of a Power Property**: The equation \\((3^k)^6 = 3^6\\) involves a power raised to another power. The property states that \\((a^m)^n = a^{mn}\\). We apply this property to simplify the left-hand side:\n   \\[\n   (3^k)^6 = 3^{k \\cdot 6} = 3^{6k}\n   \\]\n   So, the equation becomes:\n   \\[\n   3^{6k} = 3^6\n   \\]\n2. **Equate the Exponents**: Since the bases are the same on both sides of the equation, the exponents must be equal for the equality to hold:\n   \\[\n   6k = 6\n   \\]\n3. **Solve for \\( k \\)**: Divide both sides of the equation by 6 to find \\( k \\):\n   \\[\n   k = \\frac{6}{6} = 1\n   \\]\nThus, the value of \\( k \\) is \\(\\boxed{1}\\).",
