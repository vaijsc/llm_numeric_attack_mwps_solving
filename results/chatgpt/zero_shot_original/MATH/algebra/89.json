        "To find the smallest value of the quadratic expression \\( f(x) = x^2 - 6x + 13 \\), we can first complete the square.\nThe given expression is:\n\\[ f(x) = x^2 - 6x + 13. \\]\nTo complete the square, we look at the \\( x^2 - 6x \\) part. We take the coefficient of \\( x \\), which is \\(-6\\), divide it by 2 to get \\(-3\\), and then square it to get \\( 9 \\). We can rewrite the expression by completing the square as follows:\n\\[ f(x) = (x^2 - 6x + 9) + 13 - 9. \\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ f(x) = (x - 3)^2 + 4. \\]\nThe expression \\((x - 3)^2\\) represents a perfect square, which is always non-negative (\\( (x - 3)^2 \\geq 0 \\)). The minimum value of \\((x - 3)^2\\) is \\(0\\), which occurs when \\(x = 3\\).\nTherefore, the minimum value of \\( f(x) \\) is:\n\\[ f(3) = (3 - 3)^2 + 4 = 0 + 4 = 4. \\]\nThus, the smallest value of the expression \\(x^2 - 6x + 13\\) for integer \\(x\\) is \\(\\boxed{4}\\).",
        "To find the smallest value of the quadratic expression \\( f(x) = x^2 - 6x + 13 \\), we first need to identify the vertex of the parabola represented by the quadratic.

Here, \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -6 \\), and \\( c = 13 \\).\nThe x-coordinate of the vertex of a parabola described by \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\) can be found using the formula:\n\\[\nx = -\\frac{b}{2a}\n\\]\nSubstituting the given values:\n\\[\nx = -\\frac{-6}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3\n\\]\nSo, the x-coordinate of the vertex is 3. \nSubstituting \\( x = 3 \\) into the expression to find the minimum value:\n\\[\nf(3) = (3)^2 - 6(3) + 13 \n\\]\nCalculating step-by-step:\n\\[\n= 9 - 18 + 13 \n\\]\n\\[\n= -9 + 13 \n\\]\n\\[\n= 4 \n\\]\nThus, the smallest value of the expression when \\( x \\) is an integer is \\( \\boxed{4} \\).",
