    "solution": "Let $a$ be the smaller of the two numbers and let $b$ be the larger of the two. Then $\\dfrac{a}{b}=\\dfrac{3}{5}$, so $5a=3b$. Additionally, $\\dfrac{a-4}{b+8}=\\dfrac{2}{7}$, so cross multiplying gives $7(a-4)=2(b+8)$. We now have a system of two linear equations; solving gives $a=12$, $b=20$. Since the question asks us for the value of $b$, our answer is $\\boxed{20}$.",

        "To solve the problem, let's denote the two numbers as \\(3x\\) and \\(5x\\) because the ratio of the two numbers is given as \\(3:5\\). Here, \\(3x\\) is the lesser number, and \\(5x\\) is the greater number.\nAccording to the problem, when 4 is subtracted from the lesser number and 8 is added to the greater number, the new ratio between these modified numbers is \\(2:7\\). We can express this information with the equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{3x - 4}{5x + 8} = \\frac{2}{7}\n\\]\nTo eliminate the fraction, we cross-multiply:\n\\[\n7(3x - 4) = 2(5x + 8)\n\\]\nExpanding both sides gives:\n\\[\n21x - 28 = 10x + 16\n\\]\nNext, we solve for \\(x\\) by first moving all terms involving \\(x\\) to one side and constants to the other side:\n\\[\n21x - 10x = 16 + 28\n\\]\nSimplify:\n\\[\n11x = 44\n\\]\nDivide both sides by 11 to solve for \\(x\\):\n\\[\nx = 4\n\\]\nNow we will find the greater of the two original numbers, which is given by \\(5x\\):\n\\[\n5x = 5 \\times 4 = 20\n\\]\nThus, the greater of the two numbers before 8 is added is \\(\\boxed{20}\\).",
        "To solve this problem, let's define the two numbers based on the given ratio:\n1. Assume the two numbers are \\(3x\\) and \\(5x\\) where \\(x\\) is a common factor. According to the problem, the ratio of these two numbers is \\(3:5\\).\n2. The problem goes on to modify the numbers: subtract 4 from the smaller (\\(3x\\)) and add 8 to the larger (\\(5x\\)). As a result of these operations, the new ratio is \\(2:7\\).\nThus, we can set up the equation to reflect this new ratio:\n\\[\n\\frac{3x - 4}{5x + 8} = \\frac{2}{7}\n\\]\n3. To find the value of \\(x\\), cross-multiply to eliminate the fractions:\n\\[\n7(3x - 4) = 2(5x + 8)\n\\]\n4. Expand both sides:\n\\[\n21x - 28 = 10x + 16\n\\]\n5. Solve for \\(x\\) by first isolating the \\(x\\) terms. Subtract \\(10x\\) from both sides:\n\\[\n21x - 10x = 16 + 28\n\\]\n\\[\n11x = 44\n\\]\n6.

Substitute \\(x\\) back into the expressions for the original numbers \\(3x\\) and \\(5x\\) to find the actual values:\n   - The smaller number is \\(3x = 3 \\times 4 = 12\\).\n   - The larger number is \\(5x = 5 \\times 4 = 20\\).\nTherefore, the greater of the two numbers, before 8 is added, is \\(\\boxed{20}\\).",

        "To solve this problem, we need to find the original two numbers that have a ratio of 3:5.
