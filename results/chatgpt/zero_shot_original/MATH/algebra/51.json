        "To solve the problem, we need to find \\( f(x) - f^{-1}(x) \\) given that the function \\( f \\) is invertible and satisfies \\( f(f(x)) = x \\) for all \\( x \\).\nFirst, let's analyze the property \\( f(f(x)) = x \\). This condition implies that \\( f \\) is an involution, which means that applying the function twice returns the original input, i.e., it is its own inverse. In terms of inverse functions, this can be expressed as:\n\\[\nf^{-1}(x) = f(x)\n\\]\nWe can verify this by considering the definition of an inverse function. By definition, \\( f(f^{-1}(x)) = x \\) and \\( f^{-1}(f(x)) = x \\). Given \\( f(f(x)) = x \\), we want to show \\( f^{-1}(x) = f(x) \\).\nFrom \\( f(f(x)) = x \\), taking \\( x = f^{-1}(y) \\) gives:\n\\[\nf(f(f^{-1}(y))) = f(y) = y\n\\]\nThis implies \\( f^{-1}(y) = f(y) \\) as \\( f \\) undoes its own action. Thus, the inverse of \\( f \\) is \\( f \\) itself.\nGiven \\( f^{-1}(x) = f(x) \\), we can now calculate:\n\\[\nf(x) - f^{-1}(x) = f(x) - f(x) = 0\n\\]\nThus, the result is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\]",
        "The problem gives us that \\( f(f(x)) = x \\). This property suggests that \\( f \\) is its own inverse, i.e., \\( f = f^{-1} \\).\nTo confirm this, we need to show that an invertible function \\( f \\) satisfying \\( f(f(x)) = x \\) implies \\( f \\) is its own inverse.\n1. **Understand the definition of inverse**: \n   By definition, \\( f \\) is the inverse of \\( g \\) if \\( f(g(x)) = x \\) and \\( g(f(x)) = x \\) for all \\( x \\). \n   \n2. **Plug in values**: \n   If \\( f(f(x)) = x \\), then the function \\( f \\) performs its inverse operation on itself. We can write:\n   \\[\n   f^{-1}(x) = f(x)\n   \\]\n   because applying \\( f \\) twice yields the original value \\( x \\), meaning \\( f \\) is effectively undoing itself.\n3. **Calculate \\( f(x) - f^{-1}(x) \\)**:\n   Given \\( f^{-1}(x) = f(x) \\),\n   \\[\n   f(x) - f^{-1}(x) = f(x) - f(x) = 0\n   \\]\nTherefore, \\( f(x) - f^{-1}(x) = 0 \\).\nThus, the result is \\(\\boxed{0}\\).",
        "To solve the problem and find the expression for \\( f(x) - f^{-1}(x) \\), we start by analyzing the given functional equation and properties.\n**Step 1: Understanding the Functional Equation**\nWe are given that for all \\( x \\),\n\\[\nf(f(x)) = x.\n\\]\nThis implies a unique behavior of \\( f \\) that resembles an involution: applying \\( f \\) twice returns the original value. For this condition to hold, we need that \\( f \\) is its own inverse.\n**Step 2: Relationship With Inverse**\nSince \\( f(f(x)) = x \\), it implies \\( f \\) is related to its inverse by:\n\\[\nf^{-1}(x) = f(x).\n\\]\nThis can be understood as follows: If you apply \\( f \\) to \\( x \\), you get another value \\( y = f(x) \\). When you apply \\( f \\) again to \\( y \\), you should return to \\( x \\), which implies that the original \\( y \\) (which is \\( f(x) \\)) acts like the inverse bringing it back to the starting point, that is, \\( f(y) = f(f(x)) = x \\).\nTherefore, by definition and structure due to the functional equation, \\( f^{-1}(x) = f(x) \\).\n**Step 3: Computing the Difference**\nSince \\( f(x) \\) is its own inverse, we have:\n\\[\nf(x) - f^{-1}(x) = f(x) - f(x) = 0.\n\\]\nThus the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}.\n\\]",
