        "To solve this problem, we need to determine how the offer price for the stamp changes over time. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n1. **Initial Conditions:**\n   - Three years ago, Mike paid $\\$1.25$ for the stamp.\n   - He was just offered double that amount for the stamp, which means the current offer price is \\(2 \\times \\$1.25 = \\$2.50\\).\n2. **Understanding the Offer Price Doubling:**\n   - The offer price doubles every three years.\n   - Let's list out how the price changes every three years:\n     - **Year 0 (3 years ago):** paid $\\$1.25$\n     - **Year 3 (Now):** offered $\\$2.50$\n3. **Future Offer Prices:**\n   - We are asked to find out the offer price in 12 more years. Since the offer price doubles every three years, there are four 3-year intervals in the next 12 years.\n   - **Year 6 (3 years from now):**\n     \\[\n     \\text{Offer Price} = 2 \\times \\$2.50 = \\$5.00\n     \\]\n   - **Year 9 (6 years from now):**\n     \\[\n     \\text{Offer Price} = 2 \\times \\$5.00 = \\$10.00\n     \\]\n   - **Year 12 (9 years from now):**\n     \\[\n     \\text{Offer Price} = 2 \\times \\$10.00 = \\$20.00\n     \\]\n   - **Year 15 (12 years from now):**\n     \\[\n     \\text{Offer Price} = 2 \\times \\$20.00 = \\$40.00\n     \\]\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - After 12 more years, Mike will be offered \\$40.00 for the stamp.\nTherefore, in 12 years, the offer price for the stamp will be \\(\\$40.00\\).",
        "To solve this problem, we need to determine how much the price of the stamp will be in 12 more years, given that its offer price doubles every three years.\nInitially, the offer price for the stamp was \\(\\$1.25 \\times 2 = \\$2.50\\).\nSince the offer price doubles every three years, let's calculate the offer price for each 3-year interval for the next 12 years:\n1. **After the first 3 years** (we already calculated):\n   - Offer price = \\$2.50\n2. **After the next 3 years (total 6 years):**\n   - The offer price doubles: \\(\\$2.50 \\times 2 = \\$5.00\\)\n3. **After another 3 years (total 9 years):**\n   - The offer price doubles again: \\(\\$5.00 \\times 2 = \\$10.00\\)\n4. **Finally, after another 3 years (total 12 years):**\n   - The offer price doubles once more: \\(\\$10.00 \\times 2 = \\$20.00\\)\nTherefore, in 12 more years, Mike would be offered \\(\\$20.00\\) for the stamp.",
        "To determine how much Mike will be offered for the stamp in 12 more years, we need to calculate the increase in the offer price over this period, given that the offer price doubles every three years. Let's break it down step by step.\n**Step 1: Initial Offer Calculation**\n- Mike was just offered double the amount he initially paid for the stamp.\n- Initial purchase price 3 years ago = $1.25\n- Current offer after 3 years = \\( 2 \\times 1.25 = \\$2.50 \\)\n**Step 2: Time Period Breakdown**\n- The problem states we're interested in the offer price 12 more years from the current time.\n- The total time from now is 12 years.\n- Since the price doubles every 3 years, we need to find how many 3-year periods fit into 12 years.\n- Number of 3-year periods in 12 years = \\( \\frac{12}{3} = 4 \\)\n**Step 3: Doubling of the Offer Price**\n- Starting from the current offer of $2.50, calculate the offer price as it doubles in each of these 4 periods:\n  - After 3 years from now: \\( 2.50 \\times 2 = \\$5.00 \\)\n  - After 6 years from now: \\( 5.00 \\times 2 = \\$10.00 \\)\n  - After 9 years from now: \\( 10.00 \\times 2 = \\$20.00 \\)\n  - After 12 years from now: \\( 20.00 \\times 2 = \\$40.00 \\)\nTherefore, in 12 more years, Mike will be offered \\(\\$40.00\\) for the stamp.",
        "To determine how much Mike will be offered for the stamp in 12 more years, we will follow these logical steps:\n1. **Initial Offer Calculation**:  \n   Mike paid \\$1.25 for the stamp three years ago. Currently, he was offered double that amount:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 1.25 = \\$2.50\n   \\]\n2. **Doubling Periods in 12 Years**:  \n   The offer price doubles every three years. We need to calculate how many doubling periods occur within the next 12 years:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of 3-year periods in 12 years} = \\frac{12}{3} = 4\n   \\]\n3. **Future Offer Calculation**:  \n   Starting with the current offer of \\$2.50, the price will double 4 more times in 12 years. Let's calculate each stage:\n   - After the first 3 years:  \n     \\[\n     2.50 \\times 2 = \\$5.00\n     \\]\n   - After the second 3 years:  \n     \\[\n     5.00 \\times 2 = \\$10.00\n     \\]\n   - After the third 3 years:  \n     \\[\n     10.00 \\times 2 = \\$20.00\n     \\]\n   - After the fourth 3 years:  \n     \\[\n     20.00 \\times 2 = \\$40.00\n     \\]\nTherefore, Mike will be offered \\(\\$40.00\\) for the stamp in 12 more years.",
        "To solve the problem of how much Mike will be offered for the stamp in 12 more years, given that its offer price doubles every three years, we'll need to calculate based on the given conditions:\n1. **Initial Offer:**\n   - Three years ago, Mike paid \\$1.25 for the stamp.\n   - Currently, he is offered double that amount, i.e., \\(2 \\times 1.25 = \\$2.50\\).\n2. **Doubling Period:**\n   - The value of the offer doubles every three years.\n3. **12 More Years:**\n   - We need to calculate the offer price after 12 more years.\n   - Since it doubles every three years, in 12 more years, which consists of four periods of three years each (i.e., \\(12 / 3 = 4\\)), the offer price will double \\(4\\) more times.\n4. **Calculating the Future Offer:**\n   - Current offer price = \\$2.50.\n   - Each doubling period multiplies the offer by 2.\n   - Therefore, in 12 more years:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Future Offer} = 2.50 \\times 2^4\n     \\]\n5. **Calculate:**\n   - \\(2^4 = 16\\).\n   - Multiply the current offer price by 16:\n     \\[\n     2.50 \\times 16 = 40\n     \\]\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - In 12 more years, Mike will be offered \\$40 for the stamp.\nTherefore, in 12 more years, Mike will be offered \\(\\boxed{40}\\) dollars for the stamp."
