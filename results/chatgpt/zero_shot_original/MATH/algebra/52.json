    "solution": "The common difference in this arithmetic sequence is $987 - 1000= -13$, so the $n^{\\text{th}}$ term in this sequence is $1000 - 13(n - 1) = 1013 - 13n$.  This expression is positive if and only if $1013 - 13n > 0$, or \\[n < \\frac{1013}{13} = 77 + \\frac{12}{13}.\\] Since $n$ must be a positive integer, $n \\le 77$.  Hence, the least positive integer in this sequence corresponds to the value $n = 77$, in which case $1013 - 13n = 1013 - 13 \\cdot 77 = \\boxed{12}$.",

        "To determine the least positive integer in the arithmetic sequence \\(1000, 987, 974, 961, \\ldots\\), we first need to identify the common difference of the sequence and then use the formula for the general term of an arithmetic sequence to find when the sequence becomes positive.\nFirst, notice the difference between consecutive terms:\n\\[\n987 - 1000 = -13\n\\]\n\\[\n974 - 987 = -13\n\\]\n\\[\n961 - 974 = -13\n\\]\nThus, the common difference of the sequence is \\(-13\\).\nThe formula for the \\(n\\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:\n\\[\na_n = a_1 + (n-1) \\cdot d\n\\]\nwhere \\(a_1 = 1000\\) is the first term and \\(d = -13\\) is the common difference.
