    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The radius of the circular path of the horse closer to the center is $\\frac{1}{4}$ of the radius of the path of the horse farther from the center.  Since circumference is directly proportional to radius, the length of shorter path is $\\frac{1}{4}$ of the length of the longer path.  Therefore, 4 times as many revolutions must be made to go the same distance, which is $27\\times4=\\boxed{108}$ revolutions.",

        "To solve this problem, we need to determine the circumferences of the paths the horses take and then calculate how many revolutions the second horse must complete to cover the same distance as the first horse.\n**Step 1: Calculate the circumference of the circle for the first horse.**\nThe first horse is 64 feet from the center of the merry-go-round. This distance is the radius of the circle it travels around. The formula for the circumference \\( C \\) of a circle is:\n\\[ C = 2\\pi \\times \\text{radius} \\]\nSo the circumference for the first horse's path is:\n\\[ C_1 = 2\\pi \\times 64 = 128\\pi \\]\n**Step 2: Calculate the total distance the first horse travels.**\nThe first horse makes 27 revolutions. The total distance \\( D_1 \\) traveled by the first horse is the circumference of its path multiplied by the number of revolutions:\n\\[ D_1 = 27 \\times 128\\pi = 3456\\pi \\]\n**Step 3: Calculate the circumference of the circle for the second horse.**\nThe second horse is 16 feet from the center, giving a radius of 16 feet. The circumference for the second horse's path is:\n\\[ C_2 = 2\\pi \\times 16 = 32\\pi \\]\n**Step 4: Determine how many revolutions the second horse makes to travel the same distance.**\nLet \\( n \\) be the number of revolutions the second horse needs to make to cover the distance \\( D_1 \\). Since the second horse must cover the distance of 3456\u03c0 feet, we set up the equation:\n\\[ n \\times 32\\pi = 3456\\pi \\]\nWe can cancel \\(\\pi\\) from both sides:\n\\[ n \\times 32 = 3456 \\]\nNow, solve for \\( n \\):\n\\[ n = \\frac{3456}{32} = 108 \\]\nTherefore, the second horse would need to make 108 revolutions to travel the same distance.",
        "To determine how many revolutions a horse 16 feet from the center of the merry-go-round would have to make to travel the same distance as a horse 64 feet from the center that makes 27 revolutions, we can follow these steps:\n1. **Calculate the Circumference for the Horse at 64 Feet:**\n   - The circumference \\( C \\) of a circle is calculated as \\( C = 2\\pi r \\), where \\( r \\) is the radius.\n   - For the horse 64 feet from the center, the radius \\( r_1 = 64 \\) feet.\n   - So, the circumference for this horse is \\( C_1 = 2\\pi \\times 64 = 128\\pi \\) feet.\n2. **Calculate the Total Distance Traveled by the Horse at 64 Feet:**\n   - The horse makes 27 revolutions.\n   - Total distance \\( D_1 = 27 \\times C_1 = 27 \\times 128\\pi = 3456\\pi \\) feet.\n3. **Calculate the Circumference for the Horse at 16 Feet:**\n   - For the horse 16 feet from the center, the radius \\( r_2 = 16 \\) feet.\n   - So, the circumference for this horse is \\( C_2 = 2\\pi \\times 16 = 32\\pi \\) feet.\n4. **Determine the Number of Revolutions for the Horse at 16 Feet:**\n   - Let the number of revolutions needed be \\( n \\).\n   - The total distance this horse needs to travel is the same as the distance traveled by the horse at 64 feet, which is \\( 3456\\pi \\) feet.\n   - So, we set up the equation: \\( n \\times C_2 = 3456\\pi \\).\n   - Substituting for \\( C_2 \\), we get \\( n \\times 32\\pi = 3456\\pi \\).\n5. **Solve for \\( n \\):**\n   - Divide both sides by \\( 32\\pi \\):\n     \\[\n     n = \\frac{3456\\pi}{32\\pi} = \\frac{3456}{32} = 108\n     \\]\nThus, the horse 16 feet from the center needs to make 108 revolutions to travel the same distance as the horse 64 feet from the center.",
