        "To find the 100th term of the arithmetic sequence 6, 10, 14, 18, ..., let's break down the solution step by step.\n1. **Identify the First Term and Common Difference:**\n   - The first term (\\(a\\)) of the sequence is 6.\n   - The common difference (\\(d\\)) can be found by subtracting the first term from the second term, i.e., \\(10 - 6 = 4\\).\n2. **Use the Formula for the \\(n\\)-th Term of an Arithmetic Sequence:**\n   - The formula for the \\(n\\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:\n     \\[\n     a_n = a + (n-1) \\times d\n     \\]\n   - Plugging the values into the formula, we get:\n     \\[\n     a_{100} = 6 + (100-1) \\times 4\n     \\]\n3. **Perform the Calculation:**\n   - First, calculate \\(n-1\\): \n     \\[\n     100 - 1 = 99\n     \\]\n   - Now, calculate \\(99 \\times 4\\):\n     \\[\n     99 \\times 4 = 396\n     \\]\n   - Add this to the first term:\n     \\[\n     6 + 396 = 402\n     \\]\nTherefore, the 100th term of the arithmetic sequence is 402.",
