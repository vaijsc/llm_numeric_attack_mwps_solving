    "solution": "Letting $t$ equal the number of tickets sold in a single order, we get the following inequality: \\begin{align*} 4200&<(70-(t-60))(t)\n\\\\4200&<(130-t)(t)\n\\\\4200&<130t-t^2\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad t^2-130t+4200&<0\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad (t-60)(t-70)&<0\n\\end{align*}Since the two roots of the left-hand side are 60 and 70, the inequality must change sign at these two points. For $t<60$, both factors of the inequality are negative, thus making it positive. For $60<t<70$, only $t-70$ is negative, so the inequality is negative. Finally, for $t>70$, both factors are positive, making the inequality positive once again. This tells us that the range of $t$ that will result in a profit greater than $\\$4200$ is $(60,70)$. Since the number of tickets purchased in one order must be an integer, the largest number of tickets which brings a profit greater than $\\$4200$ is $t=\\boxed{69}$.",

        "To determine the largest number of tickets, \\( t \\), that can be bought in a bulk purchase while yielding a profit greater than \\$4200 for the amusement park, we need to consider how the pricing strategy affects the total revenue. \nFirst, let's derive the expression for the cost per ticket when more than 60 tickets are purchased.
