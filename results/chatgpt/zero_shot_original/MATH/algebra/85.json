        "To solve this problem, let's analyze how the sequence is formed and identify the pattern. The sequence starts with 0, and each subsequent term is produced by alternately adding and multiplying by each successive integer.\n1. **First term**: \\( a_1 = 0 \\)\n2. **Second term**: \\( a_2 = a_1 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1 \\)\n3. **Third term**: \\( a_3 = a_2 \\times 1 = 1 \\times 1 = 1 \\)\n4. **Fourth term**: \\( a_4 = a_3 + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3 \\)\n5. **Fifth term**: \\( a_5 = a_4 \\times 2 = 3 \\times 2 = 6 \\)\n6. **Sixth term**: \\( a_6 = a_5 + 3 = 6 + 3 = 9 \\)\n7. **Seventh term**: \\( a_7 = a_6 \\times 3 = 9 \\times 3 = 27 \\)\nContinuing this process, we apply alternate operations (addition and multiplication) with increasing integers. Let's calculate the subsequent terms until we find a value greater than 125:\n8. **Eighth term**: \\( a_8 = a_7 + 4 = 27 + 4 = 31 \\)\n9. **Ninth term**: \\( a_9 = a_8 \\times 4 = 31 \\times 4 = 124 \\)\n10. **Tenth term**: \\( a_{10} = a_9 + 5 = 124 + 5 = 129 \\)\nSo, the first term in the sequence that is greater than 125 is the tenth term, \\( a_{10} = 129 \\).",
