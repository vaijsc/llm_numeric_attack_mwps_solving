    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We know that there are 125 calories in 8 fluid ounces of Vitamin Water, so we can set up the proportion $\\frac{125}{8}=\\frac{x}{12}$, where $x$ is the number of calories contained in a 12 fluid ounce bottle. Solving for $x$, we find that $x=\\left(\\frac{125}{8}\\right)(12)=\\boxed{187.5}$ calories.",

        "To determine the number of calories in a 12 fluid ounce bottle of Vitamin Water, we can set up a proportion based on the information given for the 8 fluid ounce bottle. Here's the step-by-step process:\n1. **Identify the known ratio:**  \n   An 8 fluid ounce bottle contains 125 calories.\n2. **Set up a proportion:**  \n   We want to find out how many calories (let's call it \\( x \\)) are in the 12 fluid ounce bottle. The proportion can be written as:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{125 \\text{ calories}}{8 \\text{ ounces}} = \\frac{x \\text{ calories}}{12 \\text{ ounces}}\n   \\]\n3. **Solve the proportion:**  \n   To solve for \\( x \\), we can cross-multiply:\n   \\[\n   125 \\times 12 = 8 \\times x\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   1500 = 8x\n   \\]\n   Divide both sides by 8 to solve for \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{1500}{8} = 187.5\n   \\]\n4. **Conclusion:**  \n   There would be 187.5 calories in a 12 fluid ounce bottle of Vitamin Water.",
        "To determine the number of calories in a 12 fluid ounce bottle of Vitamin Water based on the information given for an 8 fluid ounce bottle, we can follow these steps:\n1. **Understand the relationship:**  \n   We know that an 8 fluid ounce bottle contains 125 calories.\n2. **Calculate the calories per fluid ounce:**  \n   To find out how many calories are in each fluid ounce, we divide the total calories by the number of fluid ounces:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Calories per fluid ounce} = \\frac{125 \\text{ calories}}{8 \\text{ fluid ounces}} = 15.625 \\text{ calories per fluid ounce}\n   \\]\n3. **Calculate the total calories in 12 fluid ounces:**  \n   Now that we know there are 15.625 calories in each fluid ounce, we can calculate how many calories are in a 12 fluid ounce bottle by multiplying the calories per ounce by 12:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total calories in 12 fluid ounces} = 15.625 \\text{ calories/ounce} \\times 12 \\text{ fluid ounces} = 187.5 \\text{ calories}\n   \\]\nThus, a 12 fluid ounce bottle of Vitamin Water contains 187.5 calories.",

        "To determine how many calories are contained in a 12 fluid ounce bottle of Vitamin Water, we can set up a proportion based on the information provided for the 8 fluid ounce bottle. Here's how we'll approach it step by step:\n1. **Identify the known values:**\n   - An 8 fluid ounce bottle contains 125 calories.\n2. **Set up a proportion to find the calorie content for a 12 fluid ounce bottle:**\n   - The proportion is based on the assumption that the calorie content is directly proportional to the volume of the liquid. Therefore, we can write:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{125 \\text{ calories}}{8 \\text{ fluid ounces}} = \\frac{x \\text{ calories}}{12 \\text{ fluid ounces}}\n     \\]\n   - Here, \\( x \\) represents the calories in the 12 fluid ounce bottle.\n3. **Solve the proportion for \\( x \\):**\n   - Cross-multiply to find \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     125 \\times 12 = 8 \\times x\n     \\]\n   - This simplifies to:\n     \\[\n     1500 = 8x\n     \\]\n   - Divide both sides by 8 to isolate \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{1500}{8} = 187.5\n     \\]\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - There are 187.5 calories in a 12 fluid ounce bottle of Vitamin Water.\nThus, the answer is 187.5 calories.",
