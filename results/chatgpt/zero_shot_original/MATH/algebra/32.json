        "To find the sum of all 15 two-element subsets of the set \\(\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\), we proceed as follows:\n1. **Determine the number of subsets.**\n   The number of two-element subsets of a set with 6 elements is given by the combination \\(\\binom{6}{2}\\), which calculates as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{6}{2} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2 \\times 1} = 15\n   \\]\n   Hence, there are 15 two-element subsets.\n2. **Consider how often each element contributes.**\n   Each of the 6 elements in the set will appear in precisely as many subsets as there are ways to choose the remaining element for the subset from the other 5. This can be calculated by:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{5}{1} = 5\n   \\]\n   Thus, each element appears in 5 subsets.\n3. **Calculate the total contribution of each element.**\n   Since each element appears in 5 subsets, we multiply each element by 5 to determine its total contribution to the sum:\n   \\[\n   5(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6)\n   \\]\n4. **Find the sum of the elements in the set.**\n   Calculate the sum of all elements in the set:\n   \\[\n   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21\n   \\]\n5. **Multiply by the factor of repetition of each element.**\n   The total sum of all subset sums is then:\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 21 = 105\n   \\]\nThus, the sum of all the sums of the elements of each of the 15 two-element subsets is \\(\\boxed{105}\\).",
        "To solve this problem, we begin by identifying the two-element subsets of the set \\(\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\).

        "To solve this problem, we will calculate the sum of all elements in each of the 15 two-element subsets of the set \\(\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\).\nFirst, notice that each element from the original set appears in an equal number of subsets among all possible two-element subsets. Therefore, our approach will involve determining how frequently each element is counted and then calculating the contribution of each element toward the sum of all subset sums.\n### Step-by-step Solution:\n1. **Total number of two-element subsets:**\n   The number of two-element subsets of a set containing 6 elements is given by the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{6}{2}\\):\n   \\[\n   \\binom{6}{2} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2 \\times 1} = 15\n   \\]\n2. **Determine how many subsets each element appears in:**\n   Each element appears in the same number of two-element subsets. Consider any particular element \\(x\\) from the set \\(\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\). Once \\(x\\) is chosen, we need to choose 1 more element from the remaining 5 elements. Thus, the number of subsets containing \\(x\\) is \\(\\binom{5}{1} = 5\\).\n3. **Compute the total contribution of each element:**\n   Each element is part of 5 different subsets, which means each element appears 5 times in total, spanning across different subset sums.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Contribution of element } x = 5 \\times x\n   \\]\n4. **Sum of contributions from all elements:**\n   Now, let's find the total sum by considering the contributions from all elements:\n   \\[\n   5(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6)\n   \\]\n5. **Compute the sum of all elements:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21\n   \\]\n6. **Total Sum of all Subset Sums:**\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 21 = 105\n   \\]\nThus, the sum of all the computed sums of elements from each two-element subset is \\(\\boxed{105}\\).",
        "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the sum of all possible two-element subsets of the set \\(\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\).\nFirst, determine how many two-element subsets can be formed from a set of six elements. This is given by the binomial coefficient:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{2} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2 \\times 1} = 15\n\\]\nThus, there are 15 two-element subsets, as expected.\nNext, we calculate the sum of all elements in these subsets. Consider any element \\(x\\) from the set \\(\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\). We want to figure out how many times this element appears in the subsets:\nSince we are forming pairs, and each pair has exactly one other element, each element in the set appears in a subset with any of the other 5 elements. Therefore, every element appears in exactly 5 different pairs.\nLet\u2019s compute the sum contributions from each element:\n- The element 1 appears in 5 subsets, contributing a sum of \\(1 \\times 5 = 5\\).\n- The element 2 appears in 5 subsets, contributing a sum of \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\).\n- The element 3 appears in 5 subsets, contributing a sum of \\(3 \\times 5 = 15\\).\n- The element 4 appears in 5 subsets, contributing a sum of \\(4 \\times 5 = 20\\).\n- The element 5 appears in 5 subsets, contributing a sum of \\(5 \\times 5 = 25\\).\n- The element 6 appears in 5 subsets, contributing a sum of \\(6 \\times 5 = 30\\).\nTo find the total sum of all these pairs, we add the individual contributions:\n\\[\n5 + 10 + 15 + 20 + 25 + 30 = 105\n\\]\nThus, the sum of the sums of all the 15 two-element subsets of \\(\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{105}\n\\]",
        "To determine the sum of the sums of the 15 two-element subsets of \\(\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\), we start by identifying that a subset \\(\\{a, b\\}\\) where \\(a < b\\) has a sum of \\(a + b\\).\nThe first step is to count and explicitly note the number of times each element appears in these two-element subsets. Consider the following:\n1. Element \\(1\\) pairs with 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6:\n   - Pairs: \\(\\{1, 2\\}, \\{1, 3\\}, \\{1, 4\\}, \\{1, 5\\}, \\{1, 6\\}\\)\n   - Appears 5 times.\n   \n2. Element \\(2\\) pairs with 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6:\n   - Pairs: \\(\\{2, 3\\}, \\{2, 4\\}, \\{2, 5\\}, \\{2, 6\\}\\) \n   - Appears 4 times (1 counted in subset with 1).\n3. Element \\(3\\) pairs with 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6:\n   - Pairs: \\(\\{3, 4\\}, \\{3, 5\\}, \\{3, 6\\}\\)\n   - Appears 3 times (1, 2 counted in earlier subsets).\n4. Element \\(4\\) pairs with 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6:\n   - Pairs: \\(\\{4, 5\\}, \\{4, 6\\}\\)\n   - Appears 2 times.\n5. Element \\(5\\) pairs with 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6:\n   - Pairs: \\(\\{5, 6\\}\\)\n   - Appears 1 time.\n6. Element \\(6\\) pairs with 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5:\n   - Appears 0 additional times.\nSummarizing, each element appears in the subsets as follows:\n- 1 appears 5 times,\n- 2 appears 4 times,\n- 3 appears 3 times,\n- 4 appears 2 times,\n- 5 appears 1 time,\n- 6 appears 0 times. \nThe next step is calculating the total contribution of each element based on its frequency of appearance in subsets:\n\\[\n\\text{Sum} = (1 \\times 5) + (2 \\times 4) + (3 \\times 3) + (4 \\times 2) + (5 \\times 1) = 5 + 8 + 9 + 8 + 5 = 35\n\\]\nRecall that each subset contributes two times the sum of its elements because \\(a + b\\) pairs are counted twice in sum calculation \\(a\\) plus \\(b\\) and \\(b\\) plus \\(a\\).\nThe total doubled count is:\n\\[ 2 \\times \\text{Sum of elements} = 2 \\times 35 = 70 \\]\nThus, the sum of all sums of elements of the subsets is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{105}\n\\]"
