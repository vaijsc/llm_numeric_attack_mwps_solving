        "To determine how many quarts of water are needed for two teaspoons of salt, we can use the given ratio of salt to water. The recipe states that \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) teaspoon of salt is needed for each quart of water. Here's a step-by-step breakdown to solve the problem:\n1. **Understand the Proportion:**\n   The recipe requires \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) teaspoon of salt per quart of water. Let's express this as a proportion:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\text{salt}}{\\text{water}} = \\frac{1}{4} \\text{ teaspoon per quart}\n   \\]\n2. **Determine the Total Amount of Salt:**\n   We want to know how many quarts of water are needed for 2 teaspoons of salt.\n3. **Set Up the Equation:**\n   To find how many quarts of water correspond to 2 teaspoons of salt, set up the equation using the known ratio \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) teaspoon per quart:\n   \\[\n   w = \\text{quarts of water needed}\n   \\]\n   Since \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) teaspoon is needed for each quart of water, and we need 2 teaspoons, the equation becomes:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{w}{\\frac{1}{4}} = 2\n   \\]\n   Or equivalently,\n   \\[\n   w = 2 \\times 4\n   \\]\n   because dividing by \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) is the same as multiplying by 4.\n4. **Calculate the Number of Quarts:**\n   \\[\n   w = 8\n   \\]\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   Therefore, 8 quarts of water are needed for 2 teaspoons of salt.",
        "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many quarts of water are needed for two teaspoons of salt, given that the recipe uses \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) teaspoon of salt per quart of water.\n1. **Understand the ratio of salt to water:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{4} \\text{ teaspoon of salt} \\rightarrow 1 \\text{ quart of water}\n   \\]\n2. **Calculate how many times we need \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) teaspoon to make up 2 teaspoons:**\n   If \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) teaspoon corresponds to 1 quart of water, then we need to find how many \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) teaspoons fit into 2 teaspoons:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of } \\frac{1}{4} \\text{ teaspoons in 2 teaspoons} = \\frac{2}{\\frac{1}{4}}\n   \\]\n3. **Perform the division:**\n   To divide by a fraction, multiply by its reciprocal:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2}{\\frac{1}{4}} = 2 \\times 4 = 8\n   \\]\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   Therefore, 2 teaspoons of salt will require 8 quarts of water.

        "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many quarts of water are required for two teaspoons of salt. Let's go through the steps:\n1. **Understand the Ratio**: The recipe states that \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) teaspoon of salt is used per quart of water.\n2. **Determine the Number of Quart Equivalents for One Teaspoon**:\n   - We first need to figure out how many quarts of water correspond to one teaspoon of salt. \n   - Since \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) teaspoon is for one quart, we need four times the amount of salt to reach one full teaspoon, hence:\n   \\[\n   1 \\text{ teaspoon of salt} = 4 \\text{ quarts of water}\n   \\]\n3. **Calculate for Two Teaspoons**:\n   - Now, if one teaspoon corresponds to four quarts of water, then two teaspoons would correspond to:\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ teaspoons of salt} = 2 \\times 4 \\text{ quarts of water} = 8 \\text{ quarts of water}\n   \\]\nThus, for two teaspoons of salt, you will need 8 quarts of water.",
        "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many quarts of water correspond to two teaspoons of salt. We'll break it down step by step:\n1. **Understand the given ratio**: The recipe specifies that \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) teaspoon of salt is required per quart of water. This can be expressed as a ratio: \\( \\frac{\\text{1 quart of water}}{\\frac{1}{4} \\text{ teaspoon of salt}} \\).\n2. **Relate the ratio to 1 teaspoon of salt**: Since \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) teaspoon of salt is needed for 1 quart of water, it follows that to have 1 teaspoon of salt (which is four times \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\)), we would need four times the amount of water:\n   \\[\n   1 \\text{ teaspoon of salt} \\times 4 = 4 \\text{ quarts of water}\n   \\]\n3. **Calculate for 2 teaspoons of salt**: Given that 1 teaspoon of salt corresponds to 4 quarts of water, for 2 teaspoons of salt, we simply multiply the amount of water needed for 1 teaspoon by 2:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 4 \\text{ quarts of water} = 8 \\text{ quarts of water}\n   \\]\nThus, for two teaspoons of salt, 8 quarts of water will be used.",

Since 1 teaspoon corresponds to 4 quarts, for 2 teaspoons we will require:\n   \\[\n   4 \\text{ quarts/teaspoon} \\times 2 \\text{ teaspoons} = 8 \\text{ quarts}\n   \\]\nSo, you will need 8 quarts of water for 2 teaspoons of salt."
