        "To solve this problem, let's consider the given pairwise sums: \\(10, 18, 19, 20, 21, 29\\). We are looking for four distinct integers \\(a < b < c < d\\) such that each of these sums is the sum of two of the numbers.\nFirst, note that the smallest possible sum occurs when we add the smallest two numbers and the largest possible sum occurs when we add the largest two numbers. Therefore, the smallest sum, \\(10\\), must be \\(a + b\\), and the largest sum, \\(29\\), must be \\(c + d\\).\nNow, observe the other sums. The second smallest, \\(18\\), should come from adding the smallest number with the second largest number, thus it's likely to be \\(a + c\\). Similarly, the second largest sum, \\(21\\), should be from adding the largest number with the second smallest number, thus it's likely \\(b + d\\).\nNow, let's see if our assumptions hold up by checking all sums:\n- \\(a + b = 10\\)\n- \\(a + c = 18\\)\n- \\(b + d = 21\\)\n- \\(c + d = 29\\)\nWe have guessed these correctly.
