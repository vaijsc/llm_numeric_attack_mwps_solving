    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Call the amount of apples Amy has $a$ and the amount of apples Betty has $b$. We can use the following system of equations to represent the given information: \\begin{align*}\na + b &= 20 \\\\\na &= 3b \\\\\n\\end{align*}Substituting for $a$ into the first equation gives $3b + b = 20$. Solving for $b$ gives $b = 5$. Thus $a = 15$. So Amy has $15 - 5 = \\boxed{10}$ more apples than Betty.",

        "To solve this problem, we'll first represent the number of apples Amy and Betty have using algebra.\n1. Let's define the variables:\n   - Let \\( B \\) be the number of apples Betty has.\n   - Since Amy has three times the number of apples that Betty has, Amy has \\( 3B \\) apples.\n2. According to the problem, together they have 20 apples. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n   \\[\n   B + 3B = 20\n   \\]\n3. Simplifying the equation:\n   \\[\n   4B = 20\n   \\]\n4. Solve for \\( B \\):\n   \\[\n   B = \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n5. Now that we know Betty has 5 apples, we can find out how many apples Amy has:\n   \\[\n   3B = 3 \\times 5 = 15\n   \\]\n6. To find how many more apples Amy has than Betty, subtract the number of apples Betty has from the number of apples Amy has:\n   \\[\n   15 - 5 = 10\n   \\]\nTherefore, Amy has 10 more apples than Betty.",
        "To solve this problem, we'll define variables and work through the solution step by step.\n1. **Define variables:**\n   - Let \\( B \\) represent the number of apples Betty has.\n   - Since Amy has three times the number of apples that Betty has, Amy has \\( 3B \\) apples.\n2. **Express the total number of apples:**\n   - Together, Amy and Betty have 20 apples, so we can write the equation:\n     \\[\n     B + 3B = 20\n     \\]\n3. **Combine and solve for \\( B \\):**\n   - Simplify the equation:\n     \\[\n     4B = 20\n     \\]\n   - Divide both sides by 4 to find the value of \\( B \\):\n     \\[\n     B = 5\n     \\]\n4. **Find the number of apples Amy has:**\n   - Since Amy has three times the number of apples that Betty has:\n     \\[\n     3B = 3 \\times 5 = 15\n     \\]\n5. **Calculate how many more apples Amy has than Betty:**\n   - Subtract the number of apples Betty has from the number of apples Amy has:\n     \\[\n     15 - 5 = 10\n     \\]\nAmy has 10 more apples than Betty.",
        "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many apples each person has and then find the difference between the number of apples Amy has and the number Betty has. Let's go step by step:\n1. **Identify Variables:**\n   - Let \\( B \\) represent the number of apples Betty has.\n   - Since Amy has three times the number of apples that Betty has, the number of apples Amy has is \\( 3B \\).\n2. **Equation for Total Apples:**\n   - Together, they have 20 apples, which gives us the equation: \n     \\[\n     B + 3B = 20\n     \\]\n3. **Solve for \\( B \\):**\n   - Combine the terms on the left:\n     \\[\n     4B = 20\n     \\]\n   - Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \\( B \\):\n     \\[\n     B = 5\n     \\]\n4. **Find the Number of Apples Amy Has:**\n   - Since Amy has three times the number of apples Betty has:\n     \\[\n     3B = 3 \\times 5 = 15\n     \\]\n5. **Calculate How Many More Apples Amy Has than Betty:**\n   - Amy has 15 apples, and Betty has 5 apples.\n   - The difference in the number of apples between Amy and Betty is:\n     \\[\n     15 - 5 = 10\n     \\]\nTherefore, Amy has 10 more apples than Betty.",
        "To solve this problem, let's start by defining a variable to represent the number of apples that Betty has. Let \\( B \\) be the number of apples that Betty has.\nAccording to the problem, Amy has three times the number of apples that Betty has. Therefore, the number of apples that Amy has is \\( 3B \\).\nTogether, Amy and Betty have 20 apples. We can express this as an equation:\n\\[\nB + 3B = 20\n\\]\nSimplifying the equation, we combine like terms:\n\\[\n4B = 20\n\\]\nTo find the value of \\( B \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:\n\\[\nB = \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n\\]\nSo, Betty has 5 apples.\nSince Amy has three times the number of apples that Betty has, Amy has:\n\\[\n3 \\times 5 = 15\n\\]\nTherefore, Amy has 15 apples.\nNow, to find out how many more apples Amy has than Betty, we subtract the number of apples Betty has from the number of apples Amy has:\n\\[\n15 - 5 = 10\n\\]\nThus, Amy has 10 more apples than Betty.",
