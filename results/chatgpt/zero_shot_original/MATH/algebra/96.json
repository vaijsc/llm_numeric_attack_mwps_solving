    "problem": "Twelve people purchased supplies for a ten-day camping trip with the understanding that each of the twelve will get equal daily shares. They are then joined by three more people, but make no further purchases. How many days will the supplies last if the original daily share for each person is not changed?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since each person of the original group had 10 daily shares, the total supplies are equivalent to 120 daily shares. When 3 people join the group, the total number of people becomes 15. Then each person in the new group will have $\\frac{120}{15}$ or 8 daily shares. The supplies will last $\\boxed{8}$ days.",

        "To solve this problem, we need to determine how long the supplies will last when the number of people sharing them increases from twelve to fifteen, while maintaining the same daily share per person.\n1. **Initial Supplies Calculation:**\n   - The supplies were originally purchased for 12 people for 10 days.\n   - Let's define the amount of supplies consumed by one person in one day as 1 \"unit.\"\n   - Therefore, in one day, 12 people consume \\( 12 \\times 1 = 12 \\) units of supplies.\n   - For 10 days, the total amount of supplies consumed by 12 people would be \\( 12 \\times 10 = 120 \\) units.\n2. **Determine Total Units of Supplies:**\n   - From the calculation above, the total amount of supplies available is 120 units.\n3. **New Group Size:**\n   - Now, the group increases to 15 people.\n4. **Daily Consumption with Increased Group Size:**\n   - With 15 people, the daily consumption of supplies becomes \\( 15 \\times 1 = 15 \\) units per day.\n5. **Calculate Number of Days Supplies Will Last:**\n   - We have to determine how many full days 120 units of supplies will last when 15 units are consumed each day.\n   - We do this by dividing the total units of supplies by the daily consumption rate: \n     \\[\n     \\frac{120 \\text{ units}}{15 \\text{ units/day}} = 8 \\text{ days}\n     \\]\nThus, the supplies will last for 8 days when the group size increases to 15 people, maintaining the original daily share per person.",
        "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:\n1. **Initial Supplies and Consumption:**\n   - There are initially 12 people.\n   - The supplies are intended to last for 10 days for these 12 people.\n   - This means the supplies can be defined as 12 people \u00d7 10 days = 120 person-days of supplies.\n2. **Understanding Person-Days:**\n   - A \"person-day\" is the amount of supplies one person would consume in one day.\n   - With 120 person-days of supplies, we have enough for any combination of people and days that equals 120 person-days.\n3. **Adding More People:**\n   - Now, 3 more people join, so there are 15 people in total.\n   - The daily consumption rate for 15 people will be 15 person-days per day.\n4. **Calculating How Long the Supplies Last:**\n   - We have 120 person-days of supplies.\n   - With 15 people consuming 15 person-days of supplies each day, the supplies will now last:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{120 \\text{ person-days}}{15 \\text{ people per day}} = 8 \\text{ days}\n     \\]\nTherefore, if the original daily share for each person remains unchanged, the supplies will last for 8 days with the addition of 3 more people.",
        "To solve this problem, we need to determine how the additional people joining the group affect the duration for which the supplies will last. Let's break it down step-by-step:\n1. **Initial Supplies and Consumption:**\n   - Twelve people originally purchase enough supplies for a 10-day camping trip.\n   - Therefore, the supplies are sufficient to provide each of the 12 people with a daily share for 10 days.\n2. **Understanding Total Supplies:**\n   - Since each person has enough supplies for 10 days, the total \"person-days\" of supplies available is:\n     \\[\n     12 \\text{ people} \\times 10 \\text{ days} = 120 \\text{ person-days of supplies}.\n     \\]\n3. **Additional People Join:**\n   - Three more people join the original group, bringing the total to 15 people.\n4. **Redistribution of Supplies:**\n   - Now, these 15 people must consume the 120 person-days of supplies.\n   - We need to calculate how many full days the supplies can last for 15 people under the original consumption conditions.\n5. **Calculation of New Duration:**\n   - To find out how many days the supplies will last for 15 people, divide the total person-days of supplies by the new number of people:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{120 \\text{ person-days}}{15 \\text{ people}} = 8 \\text{ days}.\n     \\]\nTherefore, if the original daily share for each person remains unchanged, the supplies will last for 8 days once the group is expanded to 15 people.",
        "To solve this problem, let's follow these steps:\n1. **Initial Setup**:\n   - There are initially 12 people.\n   - They have supplies for a 10-day trip.\n   - Therefore, the total amount of supplies is sufficient to provide for \\(12 \\text{ people} \\times 10 \\text{ days} = 120 \\text{ person-days}\\).\n2. **Additional People Join**:\n   - Three more people join, making the total number of people 15.\n3. **Determine How Long Supplies Last**:\n   - The daily consumption with 15 people will be 15 person-days worth of supplies each day.\n   - To find out how many days the supplies will last with 15 people, divide the total supply by the new daily consumption:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of days the supplies will last} = \\frac{120 \\text{ person-days}}{15 \\text{ people per day}} = 8 \\text{ days}\n   \\]\nSo, if the original daily share for each person is not changed, the supplies will last for 8 days with the addition of the three new people.",
