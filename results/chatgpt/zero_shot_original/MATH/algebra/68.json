        "To solve this problem, we need to examine the pattern where each row \\(n\\) in this triangular formation consists of the positive proper fractions with a denominator \\(n+1\\).

        "To solve the problem, we first note that each row in the given pattern consists of positive, proper fractions with the same denominator.
