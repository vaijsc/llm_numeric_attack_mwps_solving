        "To solve the equation \\(2^8 = 4^x\\), we can take the following steps:\n1. **Express \\(4\\) in terms of base \\(2\\):**  \n   We know that \\(4\\) can be written as \\(2^2\\). Therefore, \\(4^x\\) can be rewritten using base \\(2\\):\n   \\[\n   4^x = (2^2)^x\n   \\]\n2. **Apply the power of a power property:**  \n   According to the power of a power property, \\((a^m)^n = a^{m \\times n}\\). Using this property, we rewrite \\((2^2)^x\\):\n   \\[\n   (2^2)^x = 2^{2x}\n   \\]\n3. **Set the exponents equal:**  \n   Now the equation \\(2^8 = 2^{2x}\\) has the same base. So, we equate the exponents:\n   \\[\n   8 = 2x\n   \\]\n4. **Solve for \\(x\\):**  \n   Divide both sides of the equation by \\(2\\) to solve for \\(x\\):\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{8}{2} = 4\n   \\]\nThus, the value of \\(x\\) is \\(\\boxed{4}\\).",
