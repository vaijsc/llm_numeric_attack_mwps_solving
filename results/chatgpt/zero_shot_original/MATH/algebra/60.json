        "To find the value of \\( x \\) that gives the minimum value for the quadratic expression \\( x^2 - 14x + 3 \\), we can complete the square or use the vertex formula for a quadratic function.\nThe given quadratic expression is:\n\\[ f(x) = x^2 - 14x + 3. \\]\nA quadratic function in the standard form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\) has its vertex (which corresponds to the minimum or maximum point depending on the concavity) at:\n\\[ x = -\\frac{b}{2a}. \\]\nHere, \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -14 \\), and \\( c = 3 \\).\nPlugging these values into the vertex formula gives:\n\\[ x = -\\frac{-14}{2 \\cdot 1} = \\frac{14}{2} = 7. \\]\nThus, \\( x = 7 \\) is the value that will give the minimum value of the quadratic expression.\nTo confirm, let's complete the square for the quadratic expression:\n1. Start with \\( x^2 - 14x + 3 \\).\n2. Focus on the \\( x^2 - 14x \\) part. Take half of the coefficient of \\( x \\), which is \\(-14\\), yielding \\(-7\\). \n3. Square this value, \\((-7)^2 = 49\\), and add and subtract it within the expression:\n\\[\nx^2 - 14x + 49 - 49 + 3 = (x - 7)^2 - 49 + 3.\n\\]\n4. Simplify to get:\n\\[\n(x - 7)^2 - 46.\n\\]\nThe expression \\((x - 7)^2\\) is always non-negative and reaches its minimum value of 0 when \\( x = 7 \\). Therefore, the expression \\( (x - 7)^2 - 46 \\) achieves its minimum value when \\( x = 7 \\).\nThus, the value of \\( x \\) that gives the minimum value for \\( x^2 - 14x + 3 \\) is \\( \\boxed{7} \\).",
        "To find the value of \\( x \\) that minimizes the quadratic expression \\( x^2 - 14x + 3 \\), we can use the vertex formula for a parabola.

Using the vertex formula:\n\\[\nx = -\\frac{b}{2a} = -\\frac{-14}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{14}{2} = 7\n\\]\nTherefore, the value of \\( x \\) that minimizes the expression \\( x^2 - 14x + 3 \\) is \\( x = 7 \\).",
