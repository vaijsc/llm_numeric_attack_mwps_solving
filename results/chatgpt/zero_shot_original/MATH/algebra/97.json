        "To determine the number of integers in the arithmetic sequence 13, 20, 27, 34, ..., 2008, we start by identifying the key components of the sequence.\nFirst, identify the first term \\( a \\) and the common difference \\( d \\):\n- The first term \\( a = 13 \\).\n- The common difference \\( d = 20 - 13 = 7 \\).\nThe \\( n \\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula:\n\\[\na_n = a + (n-1) \\cdot d\n\\]\nWe know that the last term \\( a_n = 2008 \\).
