        "We begin with the quadratic equation given by:\n\\[\n2x(x-10) = -50\n\\]\nExpanding the left-hand side, we have:\n\\[\n2x^2 - 20x = -50\n\\]\nTo convert this into a standard form of a quadratic equation, we add 50 to both sides:\n\\[\n2x^2 - 20x + 50 = 0\n\\]\nThis can be simplified by dividing every term by 2:\n\\[\nx^2 - 10x + 25 = 0\n\\]\nNow, we recognize that this quadratic can be factored as a perfect square:\n\\[\n(x - 5)^2 = 0\n\\]\nTaking the square root of both sides gives:\n\\[\nx - 5 = 0 \n\\]\nThus, solving for \\(x\\), we have:\n\\[\nx = 5\n\\]\nSince the equation \\((x - 5)^2 = 0\\) indicates that \\(x = 5\\) is a repeated root, it is the only value that satisfies the equation.\nThe sum of all possible values of \\(x\\) is therefore:\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]",
        "To find the sum of all possible values of \\( x \\) that satisfy the equation \\( 2x(x-10) = -50 \\), we start by simplifying the equation:\nFirst, rewrite the given equation:\n\\[\n2x(x-10) = -50\n\\]\nExpanding the left side:\n\\[\n2x^2 - 20x = -50\n\\]\nBring all terms to one side to set the equation to zero:\n\\[\n2x^2 - 20x + 50 = 0\n\\]\nTo simplify, divide the entire equation by 2:\n\\[\nx^2 - 10x + 25 = 0\n\\]\nThis is a quadratic equation. We either solve it using the quadratic formula, factoring, or completing the square. Here, we notice the equation can be factored.\nThe expression \\( x^2 - 10x + 25 \\) is a perfect square trinomial:\n\\[\n(x - 5)^2 = 0\n\\]\nThus, the equation is:\n\\[\n(x - 5)^2 = 0\n\\]\nSolving for \\( x \\) gives:\n\\[\nx - 5 = 0 \\implies x = 5\n\\]\nSince the linear factor \\( (x-5) \\) is repeated, the only solution is \\( x = 5 \\).
