        "To determine the range of the function \\( f(x) = \\sqrt{x^2} \\), we begin by simplifying the expression. The function \\( f(x) = \\sqrt{x^2} \\) can be rewritten using the absolute value function as follows:\n\\[\nf(x) = \\sqrt{x^2} = |x|.\n\\]\nWith this simplification, we need to determine the range of the function \\( f(x) = |x| \\).\nThe absolute value function \\( |x| \\) returns the non-negative magnitude of \\( x \\). Therefore, for any real number \\( x \\):\n- If \\( x \\geq 0 \\), then \\( |x| = x \\).\n- If \\( x < 0 \\), then \\( |x| = -x \\).\nThus, the output of \\( |x| \\) is always non-negative, regardless of the input value of \\( x \\).\nTherefore, the range of \\( f(x) = \\sqrt{x^2} = |x| \\) is the set of all non-negative real numbers. In interval notation, this range is expressed as:\n\\[\n[0, \\infty)\n\\]\nThus, the range of the function \\( f(x) = \\sqrt{x^2} \\) is \\([0, \\infty)\\).",
        "To determine the range of the function \\( f(x) = \\sqrt{x^2} \\), we first need to understand what the function represents and how it behaves for different values of \\( x \\).\n1. **Understanding the Expression \\( \\sqrt{x^2} \\):**\n   The expression \\( \\sqrt{x^2} \\) can be simplified to \\( |x| \\). This is because:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{x^2} = |x|\n   \\]\n   The square root of \\( x^2 \\) is the absolute value of \\( x \\) since the square root function always returns the non-negative value for any \\( x \\).\n2. **Analyzing the Range of \\( |x| \\):**\n   The absolute value function \\( |x| \\) is defined as:\n   \\[\n   |x| = \n   \\begin{cases} \n   x & \\text{if } x \\geq 0 \\\\ \n   -x & \\text{if } x < 0 \n   \\end{cases}\n   \\]\n   For any real number \\( x \\), the absolute value \\( |x| \\) is always greater than or equal to zero. Specifically, \\( |x| \\geq 0 \\).\n3. **Finding the Range:**\n   Since \\( f(x) = |x| \\), the range of \\( f(x) \\) is all non-negative real numbers. This is because \\( |x| \\) can take any value from 0 to \\(\\infty\\) as \\( x \\) varies over all real numbers. Therefore, the range of \\( f(x) \\) is:\n   \\[\n   [0, \\infty)\n   \\]\nHence, the range of the function \\( f(x) = \\sqrt{x^2} \\) is \\([0, \\infty)\\).",
        "To determine the range of the function \\( f(x) = \\sqrt{x^2} \\), we first need to understand the behavior of the function.\n1. **Simplifying the Function**:  \n   The expression inside the square root, \\( x^2 \\), can be rewritten as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{x^2} = |x|\n   \\]\n   where \\(|x|\\) denotes the absolute value of \\(x\\).\n2. **Understanding Absolute Value**:  \n   For any real number \\( x \\), the absolute value \\(|x|\\) is defined as:\n   \\[\n   |x| = \n   \\begin{cases} \n   x & \\text{if } x \\geq 0 \\\\\n   -x & \\text{if } x < 0 \n   \\end{cases}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, \\( f(x) = |x| \\).\n3. **Determining the Range**:  \n   Since \\(|x|\\) represents the distance of \\( x \\) from zero, it is always non-negative:\n   \\[\n   |x| \\geq 0\n   \\]\n   and thus, the minimum value is 0. Additionally, for any positive value \\( y \\), there exists an \\( x \\) (namely \\( x = y \\) or \\( x = -y \\)) such that \\(|x| = y\\).
