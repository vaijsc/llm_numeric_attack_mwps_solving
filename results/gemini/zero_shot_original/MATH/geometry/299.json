    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Because the fan rotates at a constant speed, by doubling the time from 15 minutes to 30 minutes, points on the fan travel twice as far.  Furthermore, in each rotation, the point on the outer edge of the fan travels twice as far a point halfway between the center of the fan and the outer edge.  Therefore in 30 minutes a point on the outer edge of the fan travels $4 \\times 97968 = \\boxed{391872}$ inches.\n\n$\\textbf{Alternate solution}$:\n\nIn 15 minutes, the fan makes $80\\cdot15=1200$ revolutions. That means in each revolution, the halfway point travels $97968/1200$ inches. This is equal to the circumference of the circle on which the halfway point travels. Since circumference is equal to $2\\pi r$, the radius $r$ is equal to $97968/(1200\\cdot2\\cdot\\pi)=97968/(2400\\pi)$ inches. The radius of the circle on which the outer point travels is double the radius we found, or $97968/(1200\\pi)$ inches, so the circumference is $2\\pi\\cdot97968/(1200\\pi)=97968/600$ inches. In 30 minutes, the outer point travels $2\\cdot1200=2400$ revolutions (there are 1200 revolutions in 15 minutes) around this circumference, so the point travels a total distance of $97968/600\\cdot2400=\\boxed{391872}$ inches.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the circumference of the circle traced by the point halfway to the edge:**\n* The point travels 97968 inches in 15 minutes, so in one minute it travels 97968/15 = 6531.2 inches.\n* Since the fan rotates at 80 revolutions per minute, this distance represents 80 full circumferences of the circle the point traces.\n* Therefore, the circumference of this circle is 6531.2/80 = 81.64 inches.\n**2. Find the radius of the circle traced by the point halfway to the edge:**\n* We know the circumference (C) is 81.64 inches.  We can use the formula for the circumference of a circle to find the radius (r): C = 2\u03c0r\n* Solving for r: r = C/(2\u03c0) = 81.64/(2\u03c0) \u2248 13 inches.\n**3. Find the radius of the circle traced by the point on the outer edge:**\n* The point halfway to the edge has a radius of 13 inches.  The point on the outer edge has a radius twice as large.  \n* Therefore, the radius of the circle traced by the point on the outer edge is 13 * 2 = 26 inches.\n**4. Find the circumference of the circle traced by the point on the outer edge:**\n* Using the formula C = 2\u03c0r, we find the circumference: C = 2\u03c0(26) \u2248 163.36 inches.\n**5. Find the distance traveled by the point on the outer edge in 30 minutes:**\n* In one minute, the point on the outer edge travels a distance equal to the circumference of the circle it traces, which is approximately 163.36 inches.\n* In 30 minutes, the point travels 163.36 * 30 = 4899.6 inches.\n**Answer:** A point on the outer edge of the fan travels approximately **4899.6 inches** in 30 minutes. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the circumference of the circle the midpoint travels:**\n* The point halfway between the center and the edge travels the circumference of a circle with a radius that's half the radius of the fan.\n* The point travels 97968 inches in 15 minutes, so in one minute it travels 97968/15 = 6531.2 inches.\n* This means the circumference of the circle the midpoint travels is 6531.2 inches.\n**2. Find the radius of the fan:**\n* Let the radius of the fan be *r*.  The radius of the circle the midpoint travels is *r/2*.\n* The circumference of a circle is 2\u03c0r, so 2\u03c0(r/2) = 6531.2 \n* Simplifying, we get \u03c0r = 6531.2\n* Therefore, r = 6531.2/\u03c0 \u2248 2080.8 inches.\n**3. Find the circumference of the circle the outer edge travels:**\n* The outer edge of the fan travels the circumference of a circle with radius *r*.\n* The circumference of this circle is 2\u03c0r = 2\u03c0(2080.8) \u2248 13068.8 inches.\n**4. Find the distance traveled by the outer edge in 30 minutes:**\n* In one minute, the outer edge travels 13068.8 inches.\n* In 30 minutes, it travels 30 * 13068.8 = **392064 inches**.\n**Therefore, a point on the outer edge of the fan travels 392064 inches in 30 minutes.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the distance traveled in one minute:**\n* The point halfway between the center and the edge travels 97968 inches in 15 minutes.\n* Divide the total distance by the time to find the distance traveled per minute: 97968 inches / 15 minutes = 6531.2 inches/minute\n**2. Understand the relationship between distance and radius:**\n* The distance a point travels in one revolution is equal to the circumference of the circle it traces.\n* The circumference of a circle is given by the formula: Circumference = 2 * pi * radius\n* Since the point halfway to the edge travels a certain distance in one minute, we can relate this distance to the radius of the circle it traces.\n**3. Find the radius of the circle traced by the midpoint:**\n* The fan rotates 80 revolutions per minute.\n* The point halfway to the edge travels 6531.2 inches per minute.\n* This means the circumference of the circle traced by the midpoint is 6531.2 inches / 80 revolutions = 81.64 inches per revolution.\n* Using the circumference formula, we can find the radius: 81.64 inches = 2 * pi * radius\n* Solve for the radius: radius = 81.64 inches / (2 * pi) \u2248 13 inches\n**4. Find the distance traveled by the point on the outer edge in one revolution:**\n* The radius of the circle traced by the outer edge is twice the radius of the circle traced by the midpoint (since the point is at the outer edge).\n* Therefore, the radius of the circle traced by the outer edge is 13 inches * 2 = 26 inches.\n* The circumference of this circle (the distance traveled in one revolution) is 2 * pi * 26 inches \u2248 163.36 inches.\n**5. Calculate the distance traveled by the outer edge in 30 minutes:**\n* The outer edge travels 163.36 inches per revolution.\n* The fan rotates 80 revolutions per minute.\n* In 30 minutes, the fan makes 80 revolutions/minute * 30 minutes = 2400 revolutions.\n* The total distance traveled by the outer edge is 163.36 inches/revolution * 2400 revolutions = **392,064 inches**.\n**Therefore, a point on the outer edge of the fan travels approximately 392,064 inches in 30 minutes.** \n",
