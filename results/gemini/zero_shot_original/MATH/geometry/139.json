        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Set up the equation:**\n* **Surface Area:**  A cube has 6 square faces, each with area  *s*\u00b2.  The total surface area is 6*s\u00b2\n* **Volume:** The volume of a cube is *s*\u00b3.\n* **Edge Length:** The edge length is simply *s*.\nThe problem states:  Surface Area = Volume + 5(Edge Length)\nThis translates to the equation:  6*s\u00b2 = s\u00b3 + 5s\n**2. Simplify the equation:**\nSubtract 6*s\u00b2 and 5*s from both sides to get:\ns\u00b3 - 6*s\u00b2 + 5s = 0\n**3. Factor the equation:**\nNotice that all terms have a common factor of *s*. Factor it out:\ns(s\u00b2 - 6s + 5) = 0\nNow factor the quadratic:\ns(s - 1)(s - 5) = 0\n**4. Solve for *s***\nThe equation is now in factored form. For the product to be zero, at least one of the factors must be zero. This gives us three possible solutions:\n* s = 0 \n* s = 1\n* s = 5\n**5. Check for valid solutions:**\nThe problem states that *s > 0*.  Therefore, the only valid solutions are:\n* s = 1\n* s = 5\n**6. Find the sum of the solutions:**\nThe sum of the possible values of *s* is 1 + 5 = **6**. \n",
