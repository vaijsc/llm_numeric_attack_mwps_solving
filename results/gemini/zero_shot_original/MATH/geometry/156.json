        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Focus on the angles within the triangle:**\n* Since $WXYZ$ is a rectangle, we know $\\angle WXZ = 90^\\circ$.\n* Also, $\\angle BZW = 90^\\circ - 26^\\circ = 64^\\circ$ (angles in a right triangle).\n* Similarly, $\\angle CXY = 90^\\circ - 64^\\circ = 26^\\circ$.\n**2.  Identify key angle relationships:**\n*  Notice that $\\angle BZW + \\angle WXZ + \\angle XZC = 180^\\circ$ (angles on a straight line).  Substituting the values we know: $64^\\circ + 90^\\circ + \\angle XZC = 180^\\circ$.  Solving for $\\angle XZC$, we get $\\angle XZC = 26^\\circ$.\n**3. Apply the Angle Addition Postulate:**\n* $\\angle BAC = \\angle BAX + \\angle XAC$.\n* We know $\\angle BAX = \\angle BZW = 64^\\circ$ (alternate interior angles, since $WX$ is parallel to $YZ$).\n* We also know $\\angle XAC = \\angle CXY = 26^\\circ$ (alternate interior angles, since $WX$ is parallel to $YZ$).\n**4. Calculate the final answer:**\n* Therefore, $\\angle BAC = 64^\\circ + 26^\\circ = \\boxed{90^\\circ}$. \n",

Apply angle addition:**\n*  $\\angle BAC = \\angle BWY + \\angle WYA + \\angle CXY$.  We know $\\angle BWY = 64^\\circ$ and $\\angle CXY = 64^\\circ$.  To find $\\angle WYA$, we can use the fact that the angles in triangle $WYA$ add up to $180^\\circ$:\n    * $\\angle WYA = 180^\\circ - \\angle WYZ - \\angle YAW = 180^\\circ - 90^\\circ - \\angle YAW = 90^\\circ - \\angle YAW$.\n**4. Recognize that $\\angle YAW$ is an alternate interior angle:**\n*  Notice that line segment $WA$ is a transversal cutting parallel lines $WZ$ and $YC$ (since $WXYZ$ is a rectangle). Therefore, $\\angle YAW = \\angle CXZ = 26^\\circ$.\n**5. Calculate $\\angle BAC$:**\n* $\\angle WYA = 90^\\circ - \\angle YAW = 90^\\circ - 26^\\circ = 64^\\circ$.\n* $\\angle BAC = \\angle BWY + \\angle WYA + \\angle CXY = 64^\\circ + 64^\\circ + 64^\\circ = \\boxed{192^\\circ}$. \n",

Use the Angle Addition Postulate:**\n*  We know that $\\angle BAC$ is the sum of $\\angle BAX$ and $\\angle CAX$:\n    *  $\\angle BAC = \\angle BAX + \\angle CAX$\n*  Since $\\angle BAX = \\angle AXB = 64^\\circ$ and $\\angle CAX = \\angle CXY = 64^\\circ$, we can substitute:\n    * $\\angle BAC = 64^\\circ + 64^\\circ = 128^\\circ$\n**Therefore,  $m\\angle BAC = \\boxed{128}$ degrees.** \n",
