        "Here's how to find the radius of the inscribed circle:\n**1. Recognize the Triangle Type**\nNotice that the side lengths of the triangle (15, 41, 52) form a Pythagorean triple (15\u00b2 + 41\u00b2 = 52\u00b2). This means triangle ABC is a right triangle with right angle at A.\n**2.  Key Formula**\nThe radius (r) of the inscribed circle of a triangle is related to the area (K) of the triangle and its semiperimeter (s) by the formula:\n*  r = K/s\n**3. Calculate the Area (K)**\nSince the triangle is right-angled, we can easily find its area:\n*  K = (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 15 * 41 = 307.5\n**4. Calculate the Semiperimeter (s)**\nThe semiperimeter is half the perimeter:\n* s = (15 + 41 + 52) / 2 = 54\n**5. Find the Radius (r)**\nNow, plug the values of K and s into the formula:\n* r = K/s = 307.5 / 54 = **5.69** (approximately)\n**Therefore, the radius of the circle inscribed in triangle ABC is approximately 5.69 units.** \n",

This means triangle ABC is a right triangle with right angle at A.\n**2.  Understanding the Incenter**\nThe incenter of a triangle is the point where the angle bisectors of the triangle intersect.  It is also the center of the inscribed circle.\n**3.  Inradius Formula**\nThe radius of the inscribed circle (inradius) is given by:\n* **r = Area of triangle / Semiperimeter of triangle** \n* **Semiperimeter (s) = (a + b + c) / 2** where a, b, and c are the sides of the triangle.\n**4.  Calculate the Area and Semiperimeter**\n* **Area:**  Since the triangle is right-angled, its area is (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 15 * 41 = 307.5\n* **Semiperimeter:**  s = (15 + 41 + 52) / 2 = 54\n**5. Calculate the Inradius**\n* **r = Area / Semiperimeter = 307.5 / 54 = 5.694 (approximately)**\n**Therefore, the radius of the circle inscribed in triangle ABC is approximately 5.694.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Recognize the Triangle Type**\nNotice that the sides of the triangle satisfy the Pythagorean Theorem: 15\u00b2 + 52\u00b2 = 41\u00b2. This means triangle ABC is a right triangle with right angle at B.\n**2. Understand Inradius and Area**\nThe inradius (r) of a triangle is the radius of the circle inscribed within it. The inradius is related to the triangle's area (K) and semiperimeter (s) by the formula:\n* **r = K/s** \n**3. Calculate the Area**\n*  Since it's a right triangle, the area is simply half the product of the legs: K = (1/2) * 15 * 52 = 390\n**4. Calculate the Semiperimeter**\n* The semiperimeter is half the perimeter: s = (15 + 41 + 52)/2 = 54\n**5. Calculate the Inradius**\n* Now we can use the formula: r = K/s = 390/54 = **65/9**\n**Therefore, the radius of the circle inscribed in triangle ABC is 65/9.** \n",

This means triangle ABC is a right triangle with the right angle at A.\n**2. Understand the Incenter**\nThe incenter of a triangle is the point where the angle bisectors of the triangle intersect. It's also the center of the inscribed circle (the circle that touches all three sides of the triangle).\n**3.  Inradius Formula**\nThe radius of the inscribed circle (also called the inradius) is given by the following formula:\n*  **r = K/s** \n    *  **r** is the inradius\n    *  **K** is the area of the triangle\n    *  **s** is the semiperimeter of the triangle (half the perimeter)\n**4.

Calculate the Semiperimeter**\n*  **s = (1/2) * (AB + AC + BC) = (1/2) * (15 + 41 + 52) = 54**\n**6.

Determine if the Triangle is a Right Triangle**\nNotice that the sides of the triangle form a Pythagorean triple (15, 41, 52).  This means that triangle ABC is a right triangle with hypotenuse BC.\n**4. Calculate the Area**\nSince it's a right triangle, the area is simply:\n* Area = (1/2) * AB * AC\n* Area = (1/2) * 15 * 41\n* Area = 307.5\n**5. Calculate the Inradius**\nNow, we can find the inradius (r):\n* r = Area / s\n* r = 307.5 / 54\n* r = 5.694...\n**Therefore, the radius of the circle inscribed in triangle ABC is approximately 5.694 units.** \n"
