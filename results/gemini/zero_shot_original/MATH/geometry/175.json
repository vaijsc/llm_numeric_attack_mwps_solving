        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the volume of the ice sphere:**\n* The volume of a sphere is given by (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3, where r is the radius.\n* In this case, the radius of the ice sphere is 4, so its volume is (4/3)\u03c0(4\u00b3) = 256\u03c0/3 cubic units.\n**2. Find the volume of the cone:**\n* The volume of a cone is given by (1/3)\u03c0r\u00b2h, where r is the radius and h is the height.\n* In this case, the radius of the cone is 4 and the height is 5, so its volume is (1/3)\u03c0(4\u00b2)(5) = 80\u03c0/3 cubic units.\n**3. Calculate the difference in volume:**\n* Subtract the volume of the cone from the volume of the ice sphere: (256\u03c0/3) - (80\u03c0/3) = 176\u03c0/3 cubic units.\n**Therefore, the amount of water that overflows the cone is  **176\u03c0/3** cubic units.** \n",
