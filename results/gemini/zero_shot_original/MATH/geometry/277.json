        "Here's how to find the area of triangle ABC:\n**1. Visualize the Triangle**\nPlot the points A, B, and C on a coordinate plane. You'll notice that the base of the triangle lies along the horizontal line y = -1.\n**2. Find the Length of the Base**\nThe base of the triangle is the distance between points A and B. Since they share the same y-coordinate, the base length is simply the difference in their x-coordinates:\n* Base =  2 - (-4) = 6 units\n**3. Find the Height**\nThe height of the triangle is the perpendicular distance from point C to the base.  Since the base is horizontal, the height is the difference in the y-coordinates of point C and any point on the base:\n* Height = 3 - (-1) = 4 units\n**4. Calculate the Area**\nThe area of a triangle is given by:\n* Area = (1/2) * base * height\nSubstitute the values we found:\n* Area = (1/2) * 6 * 4 = 12 square units\n**Therefore, the area of triangle ABC is 12 square units.** \n",
