        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the area of quadrilateral ABCD:**\n*  You can divide the quadrilateral into two triangles:  triangle ABC and triangle ACD. \n*  Area of triangle ABC = (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 1 * 2 = 1 \n*  Area of triangle ACD = (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 3 * 3 = 4.5\n*  Area of quadrilateral ABCD = 1 + 4.5 = 5.5\n**2. Determine the required area of each piece:**\n* Since the line cuts the quadrilateral into two pieces with equal areas, each piece will have an area of 5.5/2 = 2.75.\n**3. Consider the line passing through A:**\n* Let the line passing through A intersect CD at point E. \n*  This line divides quadrilateral ABCD into triangle ABE and quadrilateral BCDE.\n**4. Express the area of triangle ABE in terms of the coordinates of E:**\n* Let the coordinates of E be (x, y). \n*  The base of triangle ABE is AB, which has length \u221a(1\u00b2 + 2\u00b2) = \u221a5.\n*  The height of triangle ABE is the perpendicular distance from E to AB.  This distance is the same as the distance from point E to the line containing AB. \n**5. Find the equation of line AB:**\n* The slope of AB is (2-0)/(1-0) = 2.\n*  The equation of line AB is of the form y = 2x + b.  Since point A (0,0) lies on the line, b = 0.\n*  Therefore, the equation of line AB is y = 2x.\n**6. Find the distance from point E to line AB:**\n* The distance from a point (x\u2081, y\u2081) to a line Ax + By + C = 0 is given by:\n   |Ax\u2081 + By\u2081 + C| / \u221a(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2)\n*  In our case, the line AB is 2x - y = 0.  \n*  The distance from E (x, y) to AB is: |2x - y| / \u221a(2\u00b2 + (-1)\u00b2) = |2x - y| / \u221a5\n**7. Set up an equation for the area of triangle ABE:**\n* Area of triangle ABE = (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * \u221a5 * |2x - y| / \u221a5 = |2x - y| / 2\n**8. Set the area of triangle ABE equal to 2.75 and solve for y:**\n* |2x - y| / 2 = 2.75\n*  |2x - y| = 5.5\n*  This gives us two possibilities: 2x - y = 5.5  or  2x - y = -5.5\n**9. Find the equation of line CD:**\n* The slope of CD is (0-3)/(4-3) = -3.\n*  The equation of line CD is of the form y = -3x + b.  Since point C (3, 3) lies on the line, we have 3 = -9 + b, so b = 12.\n*  Therefore, the equation of line CD is y = -3x + 12.\n**10. Solve the system of equations to find the intersection point E:**\n* **Case 1:**  2x - y = 5.5 and y = -3x + 12.\n   Substituting the second equation into the first, we get: 2x - (-3x + 12) = 5.5.\n   Solving for x, we find x = 3.5.  Then, substituting back into the second equation, we find y = -3(3.5) + 12 = 1.5.\n* **Case 2:**  2x - y = -5.5 and y = -3x + 12.\n   Substituting the second equation into the first, we get: 2x - (-3x + 12) = -5.5.\n   Solving for x, we find x = 1.3.  Then, substituting back into the second equation, we find y = -3(1.3) + 12 = 8.1.\n**11. Verify the solution:**\n*  We need to check if the point E we found actually lies on line segment CD.  Since point E (3.5, 1.5) lies between points C (3, 3) and D (4, 0), it is a valid solution.  The point E (1.3, 8.1) does not lie on line segment CD.\n**Therefore, the coordinates of the point where the line intersects CD are (3.5, 1.5).** \n",
        "### Response:\n1. **Find the area of quadrilateral ABCD:**  We can use the Shoelace Theorem to find the area.  The Shoelace Theorem states that the area of a polygon with vertices $(x_1,y_1),(x_2,y_2),\\dots,(x_n,y_n)$ (listed in counterclockwise order) is given by:\n  \\[\\frac{1}{2}|(x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + \\dots + x_ny_1 - y_1x_2 - y_2x_3 - \\dots - y_nx_1)|.\\]\n  In this case, the area of $ABCD$ is:\n  \\[\\frac{1}{2}|(0\\cdot2 + 1\\cdot3 + 3\\cdot0 + 4\\cdot0 - 0\\cdot1 - 2\\cdot3 - 3\\cdot4 - 0\\cdot0)| = \\frac{1}{2}|-17| = \\frac{17}{2}.\\]\n2. **Find the equation of the line passing through A:** Since the line passes through $(0,0)$, its equation will be of the form $y = mx$.  To find $m$, we can use the fact that the line cuts the quadrilateral into two pieces of equal area.\n3. **Consider the area of triangle ABD:**  Let the point where the line intersects $\\overline{CD}$ be $E$.  Then triangle $ABD$ has base $AD = 4$ and height $2$, so its area is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 4 \\cdot 2 = 4$.\n4. **The area of triangle ADE:** Since the line cuts the quadrilateral in half, the area of triangle $ADE$ must be $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{17}{2} = \\frac{17}{4}$.\n5. **Relate the areas:** The area of triangle $ADE$ is also given by $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot AD \\cdot h$, where $h$ is the height of triangle $ADE$.  Substituting, we get:\n  \\[\\frac{17}{4} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 4 \\cdot h\\]\n  Solving for $h$, we find $h = \\frac{17}{8}$.\n6. **Find the coordinates of E:** Since the line passes through $(0,0)$ and has a slope of $m$, the equation of the line is $y = mx$.  The height of triangle $ADE$ is the perpendicular distance from $D$ to the line, which is $\\frac{17}{8}$.  Therefore, the coordinates of $E$ satisfy the following system of equations:\n  \\begin{align*}\n  y &= mx, \\\\\n  \\frac{17}{8} &= \\frac{|0 - 4m|}{\\sqrt{1 + m^2}}.\n  \\end{align*}\n  Squaring both sides of the second equation and simplifying, we get:\n  \\[289 = 64m^2(1 + m^2).\\]\n  This simplifies to $64m^4 + 64m^2 - 289 = 0$.  We can solve this quadratic in $m^2$ using the quadratic formula:\n  \\[m^2 = \\frac{-64 \\pm \\sqrt{64^2 + 4 \\cdot 64 \\cdot 289}}{2 \\cdot 64} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{10}}{2}.\\]\n  Since $m^2$ must be positive, we take the positive square root: $m^2 = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{10}}{2}$.  Therefore, $m = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{10}}{2}}$.  Since the line passes through the first and fourth quadrants, we take the positive value of $m$.\n7. **Find the y-coordinate of E:**  Substituting $m = \\sqrt{\\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{10}}{2}}$ into the equation $y = mx$, we get:\n  \\[y = \\sqrt{\\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{10}}{2}} \\cdot 4 = 2 \\sqrt{2\\sqrt{10} - 2}.\\]\n  Therefore, the coordinates of $E$ are $\\boxed{\\left( 4, 2 \\sqrt{2\\sqrt{10} - 2} \\right)}$.\n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the Area of Quadrilateral ABCD**\n* You can divide the quadrilateral into two triangles:  triangle $ABC$ and triangle $ACD$.\n* **Area of triangle ABC:**  \n    * Base = 3 (from the x-coordinate difference of C and A)\n    * Height = 2 (from the y-coordinate of B)\n    * Area = (1/2) * 3 * 2 = 3\n* **Area of triangle ACD:**\n    * Base = 4 (from the x-coordinate difference of D and A)\n    * Height = 3 (from the y-coordinate of C)\n    * Area = (1/2) * 4 * 3 = 6\n* **Area of quadrilateral ABCD:** 3 + 6 = 9\n**2.  Determine the Desired Area for Each Piece**\n* Since the line cuts the quadrilateral into two pieces with equal area, each piece should have an area of 9/2.\n**3.  Find the Equation of the Line**\n* Let the line passing through A intersect line CD at point E.\n* The equation of the line passing through A and E can be written in the form y = mx, since it passes through the origin (0,0). \n* To find the slope 'm', we need to consider the areas.\n**4.  Relate the Area to the Slope**\n* **Area of triangle ACE:** (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * (x-coordinate of E) * (y-coordinate of E)\n* **Area of triangle ADE:** (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * (x-coordinate of D) * (y-coordinate of E)\nSince we want the area of triangle ACE to be 9/2, we have:\n(1/2) * (x-coordinate of E) * (y-coordinate of E) = 9/2\n**5.  Use the Equation of the Line to Simplify**\n* We know the line passes through E and has the equation y = mx.  \n* Substitute y = mx into the area equation: \n   (1/2) * (x-coordinate of E) * (mx) = 9/2\n* Simplify:  (1/2) * mx^2 = 9/2\n* Solve for x:  x^2 = 9/m\n**6.  Find the Coordinates of Point E**\n* Since point E lies on line CD, its coordinates must satisfy the equation of line CD.  Let's find the equation of line CD:\n    * Slope of CD = (0 - 3) / (4 - 3) = -3\n    * Equation of line CD:  y - 3 = -3(x - 3)  or y = -3x + 12\n* Now we have two equations:\n    * x^2 = 9/m  (from the area equation)\n    * y = -3x + 12  (from the equation of line CD)\n* Substitute y = -3x + 12 into the first equation:\n    * x^2 = 9/((-3x + 12)/x)\n    * x^2 = -3x^2/(-3x + 12)\n* Simplify and solve for x: \n    * x^3 - 12x^2 + 9x = 0\n    * x(x^2 - 12x + 9) = 0\n    * One solution is x = 0.  The other solutions are the roots of the quadratic, which can be found using the quadratic formula. \n* Substitute the relevant x-value (from the quadratic formula) into the equation y = -3x + 12 to find the corresponding y-value.\n**7. The Answer**\n* After solving the quadratic equation and substituting the x-value, you will find the coordinates of point E where the line intersects CD. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the Area of Quadrilateral ABCD**\n* We can divide quadrilateral ABCD into two triangles:  triangle ABC and triangle ACD.\n* **Area of triangle ABC:**  \n    * Base: BC = \u221a[(3-1)\u00b2 + (3-2)\u00b2] = \u221a5\n    * Height:  The perpendicular distance from A to BC.  Since A is at the origin and BC has a slope of 1/2, the height is the y-coordinate of the point where the perpendicular from A intersects BC.  This can be found using the equation of the line perpendicular to BC passing through A (y = -2x):  \n        * Solve the system of equations: y = -2x and y = (1/2)x + 1/2.\n        * This gives x = 1/5 and y = -2/5.\n        * The height is 2/5.\n    * Area = (1/2) * \u221a5 * (2/5) = \u221a5 / 5\n* **Area of triangle ACD:**\n    * Base: CD = \u221a[(4-3)\u00b2 + (0-3)\u00b2] = \u221a10\n    * Height:  The perpendicular distance from A to CD. Since A is at the origin and CD has a slope of -3, the height is the x-coordinate of the point where the perpendicular from A intersects CD.  This can be found using the equation of the line perpendicular to CD passing through A (y = (1/3)x): \n        * Solve the system of equations: y = (1/3)x and y = -3x + 12.\n        * This gives x = 9/5 and y = 3/5.\n        * The height is 9/5.\n    * Area = (1/2) * \u221a10 * (9/5) = (9\u221a10)/10\n* **Area of ABCD:** (\u221a5 / 5) + (9\u221a10)/10 = (2\u221a5 + 9\u221a10)/10\n**2.  Find the Area of Each Half**\n* Since the line through A divides ABCD into two pieces with equal area, each piece has an area of [(2\u221a5 + 9\u221a10)/10]/2 = (\u221a5 + 9\u221a10)/20\n**3.  Find the Point of Intersection on CD**\n* Let the point of intersection be (x, y).\n* Since this point lies on CD, we know y = -3x + 12.\n* We also know that the area of triangle ACD is half the area of ABCD, so:\n    * (1/2) * base * height = (\u221a5 + 9\u221a10)/20\n    * (1/2) * \u221a[(x-3)\u00b2 + (-3x + 12 - 3)\u00b2] * x = (\u221a5 + 9\u221a10)/20\n* Simplify and solve the equation for x:\n    * (1/2) * \u221a(10x\u00b2 - 60x + 117) * x = (\u221a5 + 9\u221a10)/20\n    * \u221a(10x\u00b2 - 60x + 117) * x = (\u221a5 + 9\u221a10)/10\n    * 10x\u00b2 - 60x + 117 = [(\u221a5 + 9\u221a10)/10]\u00b2\n    * Solve this quadratic equation.  The solution will give you the x-coordinate of the point of intersection.\n* Substitute the value of x back into the equation y = -3x + 12 to find the y-coordinate.\n**Therefore, the coordinates of the point where the line intersects CD can be found by solving the equation above and substituting the value of x back into the equation for CD.**  The exact solution involves some messy algebra, but you can use a calculator or computer to find the numerical values. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1.

The midpoint of CD is:\n*  [(3 + 4)/2, (3 + 0)/2] = (7/2, 3/2)\n**3. The Line of Division**\nSince the line passing through A divides the quadrilateral into two equal areas, it must pass through the midpoint of CD.  This is because the line divides the quadrilateral into two shapes with the same base (CD) and the same height (the distance from A to the line CD).\n**4.  The Intersection Point**\nTherefore, the line passing through A intersects CD at its midpoint, which is **(7/2, 3/2).** \n"
