Their areas are in the same ratio as their bases:\n   $$\\frac{[UXP]}{[UPW]} = \\frac{XP}{WP}$$\n* **Base Ratio:** Since $\\triangle PYW$ and $\\triangle PZW$ are similar, the ratio $XP/WP$ is the same as the ratio $YW/ZW = 3/7$.\n* **Area of Triangle UPW:** Triangles $\\triangle UPW$ and $\\triangle PWV$ share the same altitude from point $W$.

        "**1.  Finding the ratio of areas**\n* Since $VY:YW = 4:3$, the area of $\\triangle VPY$ is $\\frac{4}{7}$ the area of $\\triangle VPW$, and the area of $\\triangle WPY$ is $\\frac{3}{7}$ the area of $\\triangle VPW$.\n**2.  Using the given areas**\n* We know that $\\triangle PYW$ has an area of 30.  This means the area of $\\triangle VPW$ is $30 \\cdot \\frac{7}{3} = 70$.\n* Similarly, the area of $\\triangle VZW$ is $35 \\cdot \\frac{7}{4} = 61.25$.\n**3.  Relating areas to ratios**\n* Now consider the line segments $UW$ and $VZ$. They divide $\\triangle UVW$ into three smaller triangles: $\\triangle UXP$, $\\triangle PZW$, and $\\triangle VPY$.  The areas of these triangles are proportional to the lengths of the bases $UX$, $PZ$, and $VY$ respectively.\n* Since the areas of $\\triangle PZW$ and $\\triangle VPY$ are 35 and 61.25, the ratio of the lengths $PZ$ and $VY$ is $35:61.25$, which simplifies to $4:7$.\n**4.  Finding the area of $\\triangle UXP$**\n* The ratio of the areas of $\\triangle UXP$ and $\\triangle VPY$ is the same as the ratio of their bases $UX$ and $VY$. Since the ratio $PZ:VY$ is $4:7$, the ratio $UX:VY$ must also be $4:7$.  \n* Therefore, the area of $\\triangle UXP$ is $\\frac{4}{11}$ the area of $\\triangle VPY$, which is  $\\frac{4}{11} \\cdot 61.25 = \\boxed{22.27}$ (approximately). \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understanding the Ratios and Areas**\n* **VY:YW = 4:3:** This means the ratio of the heights of triangles PWY and PYV is 3:4. Since the base (PW) is the same for both, the ratio of their areas is also 3:4.\n* **Area of PYW = 30:** This means the area of PYV is (4/3) * 30 = 40.\n* **Area of PZW = 35:** This information will be useful later.\n**2. Finding the Area of Triangle PWV**\n* The area of triangle PWV is the sum of the areas of triangles PWY and PYV: 30 + 40 = 70.\n**3. Relating Areas to Ratios**\n* Let's consider the ratio of the areas of triangles PWV and PVZ. Notice that they share the same height (from point P to line VW), but their bases (VW and VZ) are in the ratio of (7:4) because VY:YW = 4:3. Therefore, the ratio of their areas is also 7:4.\n**4. Finding the Area of Triangle PVZ**\n* We know the area of triangle PWV is 70, and its area is 7/4 times larger than the area of triangle PVZ.  Therefore, the area of triangle PVZ is (4/7) * 70 = 40.\n**5.  Finding the Area of Triangle VZU**\n* Since the area of PVZ is 40 and the area of PZW is 35, the area of triangle VZU is 40 + 35 = 75.\n**6.  Finding the Area of Triangle UXP**\n* Now consider triangles VZU and UXP.  They share the same height (from point U to line VW), and their bases (VZ and VX) are in the ratio of (4:3).  This means the ratio of their areas is also 4:3.  The area of VZU is 75, so the area of UXP is (3/4) * 75 = **56.25**.\n**Therefore, the area of triangle UXP is 56.25.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Understand the Area Ratios**\n* **Similar Triangles:** Notice that triangles  $\\triangle PYW$, $\\triangle PZW$, and $\\triangle UXP$ are similar. This is because they share corresponding angles (e.g., $\\angle PYW \\cong \\angle PZW \\cong \\angle UXP$). \n* **Area Ratio:** The ratio of the areas of similar triangles is equal to the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides.\n**2. Use the Given Areas**\n* Since the area of $\\triangle PYW$ is 30 and the area of $\\triangle PZW$ is 35, the ratio of their areas is 30/35 = 6/7.\n* The square root of this ratio gives us the ratio of corresponding sides: $\\sqrt{6/7}$.  This means that $PW/PZ = \\sqrt{6/7}$.\n**3.  Find the Ratio of Sides in $\\triangle UXP$ and $\\triangle PYW$**\n* We know that $VY:YW = 4:3$.  Since $Y$ lies on line segment $VW$,  this means $VW:YW = 7:3$. \n* Since $\\triangle UXP$ and $\\triangle PYW$ are similar, the ratio of their corresponding sides is the same as the ratio of $UW$ to $YW$.  Therefore, $UX/PY = UW/YW = (VW + UW)/YW = (7+3)/3 = 10/3$.\n**4. Calculate the Area of $\\triangle UXP$**\n* The ratio of the areas of $\\triangle UXP$ and $\\triangle PYW$ is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides: $(UX/PY)^2 = (10/3)^2 = 100/9$.\n* We know the area of $\\triangle PYW$ is 30.  Let the area of $\\triangle UXP$ be $A$.  We have the proportion:\n  \n   $\\frac{A}{30} = \\frac{100}{9}$\n* Solving for $A$, we get:\n  \n   $A = 30 \\cdot \\frac{100}{9} = \\boxed{\\frac{1000}{3}}$ \n",
        "**1. Understand the Relationship Between Areas**\n* **Similar Triangles:** Since triangles $PYW$ and $PZW$ share a common vertex ($P$) and their bases lie on the same line ($WZ$), they are similar triangles.  The ratio of their areas is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides.\n**2. Find the Ratio of Sides**\n* **Area Ratio:** The area of $\\triangle PYW$ is 30, and the area of $\\triangle PZW$ is 35. The ratio of their areas is $\\frac{30}{35} = \\frac{6}{7}$.\n* **Side Ratio:**  The ratio of their corresponding sides is the square root of the ratio of their areas: $\\sqrt{\\frac{6}{7}}$.  This means $PW:PZ = \\sqrt{\\frac{6}{7}}$.\n**3.  Use the Ratio of Sides to Find the Area of Triangle PWX**\n* **Base Ratio:**  Since $PW:PZ = \\sqrt{\\frac{6}{7}}$, the ratio of the bases of triangles $PWX$ and $PZX$ is also $\\sqrt{\\frac{6}{7}}$.\n* **Area Ratio:** The ratio of their areas is the square of the ratio of their bases: $\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{6}{7}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{6}{7}$.\n* **Area of Triangle PWX:**  Since the area of $\\triangle PZW$ is 35, the area of $\\triangle PWX$ is $\\frac{6}{7} \\cdot 35 = 30$.\n**4. Use the Ratio of Sides to Find the Area of Triangle UXP**\n* **Base Ratio:**  Since $VY:YW = 4:3$, the ratio of the bases of triangles $UXP$ and $PYW$ is also $4:3$.\n* **Area Ratio:** The ratio of their areas is the square of the ratio of their bases: $\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^2 = \\frac{16}{9}$.\n* **Area of Triangle UXP:**  Since the area of $\\triangle PYW$ is 30, the area of $\\triangle UXP$ is $\\frac{16}{9} \\cdot 30 = \\boxed{53\\frac{1}{3}}$. \n"
