        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the Hypotenuse**\n* The right triangle has legs of 6 inches and 8 inches.  \n* Use the Pythagorean theorem:  a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n*  6\u00b2 + 8\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n*  36 + 64 = c\u00b2\n*  100 = c\u00b2\n*  c = 10 inches (the hypotenuse)\n**2. Calculate the Areas of the Semicircles**\n* **Semicircle 1 (along leg of 6 inches):**\n    * Radius = 6/2 = 3 inches\n    * Area of full circle = \u03c0 * 3\u00b2 = 9\u03c0 square inches\n    * Area of semicircle = (1/2) * 9\u03c0 = 4.5\u03c0 square inches\n* **Semicircle 2 (along leg of 8 inches):**\n    * Radius = 8/2 = 4 inches\n    * Area of full circle = \u03c0 * 4\u00b2 = 16\u03c0 square inches\n    * Area of semicircle = (1/2) * 16\u03c0 = 8\u03c0 square inches\n* **Semicircle 3 (along hypotenuse):**\n    * Radius = 10/2 = 5 inches\n    * Area of full circle = \u03c0 * 5\u00b2 = 25\u03c0 square inches\n    * Area of semicircle = (1/2) * 25\u03c0 = 12.5\u03c0 square inches\n**3. Find the Area of the Triangle**\n* Area of a triangle = (1/2) * base * height\n* Area = (1/2) * 6 * 8 = 24 square inches\n**4. Calculate the Area of the Shaded Region**\n* The shaded region is the area of the semicircle along the hypotenuse.\n* Area of shaded region = 12.5\u03c0 square inches\n**5. Calculate the Area of the Non-Shaded Regions**\n* The non-shaded regions are the two crescents.\n* Area of both crescents = (Area of Semicircle 1 + Area of Semicircle 2) - Area of shaded region - Area of triangle.\n* Area of both crescents = (4.5\u03c0 + 8\u03c0) - 12.5\u03c0 - 24 \n* **Area of both crescents = -24 square inches**\n**Important Note:** The area of the non-shaded crescents cannot be negative.  This means there's an error in our approach.  The issue is that we're trying to subtract the area of the triangle, which is entirely contained within the two semicircles.  \n**To Correct the Calculation:**\n1. **Find the combined area of the two smaller semicircles:** 4.5\u03c0 + 8\u03c0 = 12.5\u03c0 square inches\n2. **Subtract the area of the shaded semicircle:** 12.5\u03c0 - 12.5\u03c0 = 0 square inches\n**Therefore, the total area of the two non-shaded crescent-shaped regions is 0 square inches.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the Hypotenuse**\n* The triangle is a right triangle, so we can use the Pythagorean theorem:  a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n* a = 6 inches, b = 8 inches, and c is the hypotenuse.\n* 6\u00b2 + 8\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n* 36 + 64 = c\u00b2\n* 100 = c\u00b2\n* c = 10 inches\n**2. Find the Area of the Entire Triangle**\n* Area of a triangle = (1/2) * base * height\n* Area = (1/2) * 6 * 8 = 24 square inches\n**3. Find the Area of Each Semicircle**\n* Area of a circle = \u03c0r\u00b2\n* Area of a semicircle = (1/2)\u03c0r\u00b2\n* Semicircle on the 6-inch side: r = 6/2 = 3 inches; Area = (1/2)\u03c0(3\u00b2) = (9/2)\u03c0 square inches\n* Semicircle on the 8-inch side: r = 8/2 = 4 inches; Area = (1/2)\u03c0(4\u00b2) = 8\u03c0 square inches\n* Semicircle on the 10-inch side: r = 10/2 = 5 inches; Area = (1/2)\u03c0(5\u00b2) = (25/2)\u03c0 square inches\n**4. Find the Area of the Shaded Region**\n* The shaded region is a semicircle, so its area is (25/2)\u03c0 square inches.\n**5. Find the Area of the Two Crescent-Shaped Regions**\n* Area of the two crescents = (Area of the two smaller semicircles) + (Area of the entire triangle) - (Area of the shaded semicircle)\n* Area = [(9/2)\u03c0 + 8\u03c0] + 24 - [(25/2)\u03c0]\n* Area = 24 square inches\n**Therefore, the total area of the two non-shaded crescent-shaped regions is 24 square inches.** \n",

Find the areas of the semicircles on the legs:**\n* The legs are the diameters of the semicircles.\n* Area of the semicircle on the 6-inch leg: (1/2)\u03c0(3)\u00b2 = (9/2)\u03c0 square inches\n* Area of the semicircle on the 8-inch leg: (1/2)\u03c0(4)\u00b2 = 8\u03c0 square inches\n**4. Find the combined area of the two smaller semicircles:**\n* (9/2)\u03c0 + 8\u03c0 = (25/2)\u03c0 square inches\n**5. Find the total area of the non-shaded regions:**\n* Since the combined area of the two smaller semicircles is equal to the area of the semicircle on the hypotenuse, the total area of the non-shaded regions (the crescents) is:\n* Total area = Area of the triangle = **24 square inches** \n",
