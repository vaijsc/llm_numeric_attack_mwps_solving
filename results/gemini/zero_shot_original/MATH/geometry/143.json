        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Understanding the Grid**\nImagine the 16 points arranged in a 4x4 grid.  The distance between any two adjacent points (horizontally or vertically) is 1 unit.\n**2. Possible Square Sizes**\n* **Side Length 1:**  The smallest squares are formed by connecting adjacent points.  These squares have an area of 1. \n* **Side Length 2:**  Larger squares can be formed by connecting points that are two units apart.  These squares have an area of 4.\n* **Side Length 3:** The largest possible square uses the corners of the grid, and has an area of 9.\n**3. Counting the Squares**\n* **Side Length 1:** There are 9 squares with side length 1. (Think of a 3x3 grid within the larger grid)\n* **Side Length 2:** There are 4 squares with side length 2. (Think of a 2x2 grid within the larger grid)\n* **Side Length 3:** There is 1 square with side length 3.\n**4. Finding the Sum of Areas**\nThe sum of all possible values of A is: (9 * 1) + (4 * 4) + (1 * 9) = **9 + 16 + 9 = 34**\n**Therefore, the sum of all possible values of A is 34.** \n",
