Understand the Diagram**\n* We have a circle with center O.\n* PN and GA are diameters, meaning they pass through the center of the circle and divide the circle in half.\n*  Angle GOP is 78 degrees.\n**2. Key Properties**\n* **Diameters create right angles:**  Since PN and GA are diameters, angles PON, POA, GON, and GOA are all right angles (90 degrees). \n* **Angles on a straight line add up to 180 degrees:** Angle PON and angle GON form a straight angle, so m\u2220GON = 180\u00b0 - 90\u00b0 = 90\u00b0. \n**3. Finding \u2220NGA**\n* We know m\u2220GOP = 78\u00b0 and m\u2220GON = 90\u00b0.\n* Angle NGA is part of triangle GON.\n* The angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.\nTherefore, m\u2220NGA = 180\u00b0 - m\u2220GON - m\u2220GOP = 180\u00b0 - 90\u00b0 - 78\u00b0 = **12\u00b0** \n",
