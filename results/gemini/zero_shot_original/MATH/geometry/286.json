Find Equal Angles**\n* In isosceles triangle $ABC$,  angles $ABC$ and $ACB$ are equal.  Since $\\angle ABC = 30^\\circ$, then $\\angle ACB = 30^\\circ$.\n* In isosceles triangle $ACX$, angles $CAX$ and $CXA$ are equal.\n**3.  Use Angle Relationships**\n*  Angles $ACB$ and $BCX$ are supplementary angles (they add up to 180 degrees) because they form a straight line. So, $\\angle BCX = 180^\\circ - 30^\\circ = 150^\\circ$.\n*  Angles $CAX$, $ACB$, and $BCX$ form a straight angle, so they add up to 180 degrees. Therefore, $\\angle CAX = 180^\\circ - 30^\\circ - 150^\\circ = 0^\\circ$.\n**4.  Find Angle AXC**\n* Since $\\angle CAX = 0^\\circ$, then $\\angle AXC = \\angle CXA$ (because the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees).\n* In triangle $ACX$, we have: $\\angle AXC + \\angle CXA + \\angle CAX = 180^\\circ$. \n* Since $\\angle CAX = 0^\\circ$ and $\\angle AXC = \\angle CXA$, we can substitute: $2 \\angle AXC = 180^\\circ$.\n* Therefore, $\\angle AXC = 180^\\circ / 2 = \\boxed{90^\\circ}$. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n* **Identify key relationships:** We know that triangle $ABC$ is isosceles with $AB = AC$. We also know that $AC = CX$. This means triangle $ACX$ is also isosceles with $AC = CX$.\n* **Find angles:** Since triangle $ABC$ is isosceles with a 30-degree angle at $B$, we know the other two angles in triangle $ABC$ are also equal and add up to 150 degrees.  Therefore, angles $BAC$ and $BCA$ each measure 75 degrees.\n* **Use isosceles triangle properties:** In isosceles triangle $ACX$, we know angles $CAX$ and $CXA$ are equal.  Since the angles in any triangle add up to 180 degrees, we can find the measure of angle $AXC$: \n    *  $CAX + CXA + ACX = 180^\\circ$\n    *  $2(CAX) + 75^\\circ = 180^\\circ$  (Since $ACX = BCA = 75^\\circ$)\n    *  $2(CAX) = 105^\\circ$\n    *  $CAX = CXA = 52.5^\\circ$\n    *  $AXC = 180^\\circ - 52.5^\\circ - 52.5^\\circ = \\boxed{75^\\circ}$ \n",

So, $\\angle ACB = 180^\\circ - 30^\\circ - 30^\\circ = 120^\\circ$.\n* **Straight Angle:**  Angles $\\angle ACB$ and $\\angle ACX$ form a straight angle, which measures $180^\\circ$.  Therefore, $\\angle ACX = 180^\\circ - 120^\\circ = 60^\\circ$.\n* **Isosceles Triangle (Again):**  Since $\\angle CAX = \\angle CXA$ and $\\angle ACX = 60^\\circ$, we can find $\\angle CAX$ and $\\angle CXA$:\n   *  $\\angle CAX = \\angle CXA = (180^\\circ - 60^\\circ)/2 = 60^\\circ$.\n* **Angle AXC:**  Finally, we can find $\\angle AXC$:\n   *  $\\angle AXC = 180^\\circ - \\angle CAX - \\angle CXA = 180^\\circ - 60^\\circ - 60^\\circ = \\boxed{60^\\circ}$. \n",

        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Identify Key Relationships:**\n* **Isosceles Triangle:** Triangle ABC is isosceles, meaning AB = AC.\n* **Extended Side:** BC is extended to point X, and AC = CX.\n**2. Analyze the Triangle:**\n* **Congruent Triangles:** Since AC = CX and AB = AC, we have AB = CX. Also, BC is shared by both triangles ABC and BCX. Therefore, triangles ABC and BCX are congruent by SSS (Side-Side-Side).\n**3. Determine Angle Measures:**\n* **Corresponding Angles:**  Since triangles ABC and BCX are congruent, their corresponding angles are equal. So, angle BAC = angle BCX.\n* **Base Angles:**  In isosceles triangle ABC, the base angles are equal:  angle ABC = angle ACB.\n**4. Calculate Angle AXC:**\n* **Angle Sum Property:** The angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees. In triangle ABC, we have:\n   * angle BAC + angle ABC + angle ACB = 180 degrees\n* **Substitution:** Since angle BAC = angle BCX and angle ABC = angle ACB, we can substitute:\n   * angle BCX + angle ACB + angle ACB = 180 degrees\n   * angle BCX + 2 * angle ACB = 180 degrees\n* **Solve for angle BCX:** \n   * angle BCX = 180 degrees - 2 * angle ACB\n* **Angle AXC:**  Angle AXC is an exterior angle of triangle BCX. The measure of an exterior angle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent interior angles. Therefore:\n   * angle AXC = angle BCX + angle ACB\n   * angle AXC = (180 degrees - 2 * angle ACB) + angle ACB \n   * **angle AXC = 180 degrees - angle ACB**\n**5. Use Given Information:**\n* **Angle ACB:** The diagram shows that angle ACB = 30 degrees.\n**6. Final Calculation:**\n* **angle AXC = 180 degrees - 30 degrees = 150 degrees**\n**Therefore, the measure of angle AXC is 150 degrees.** \n"
