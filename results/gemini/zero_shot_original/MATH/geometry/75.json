        "**1. Find the area of triangle ABC:**\nSince we know the side lengths of triangle ABC, we can use Heron's formula to find its area:\n* **Semiperimeter:**  s = (13 + 5 + 12)/2 = 15\n* **Area:**  Area(ABC) = \u221a(15 * (15 - 13) * (15 - 5) * (15 - 12)) = \u221a(15 * 2 * 10 * 3) = \u221a900 = 30\n**2. Find the areas of triangles AMC and BNC:**\n* **Area(AMC):** We know AC = 5 and CM = 4. Since triangle AMC is right-angled at C, its area is (1/2) * 5 * 4 = 10.\n* **Area(BNC):** Similarly, Area(BNC) = (1/2) * 12 * 4 = 24.\n**3. Find the areas of triangles MJK and NKJ:**\n* **Area(MJK):**  We need to find the height MJ. Notice that triangle AMC is similar to triangle MJK (both are right-angled, and they share angle CAM).  Therefore, MJ/CM = AM/AC.  Since AM = AC - CM = 5 - 4 = 1, we have MJ = (1/5) * 4 = 4/5. \n    * Area(MJK) = (1/2) * JK * MJ = (1/2) * JK * (4/5) = (2/5) * JK.\n* **Area(NKJ):** Similarly, triangle BNC is similar to triangle NKJ.  Therefore, NK/CN = BN/BC. Since BN = BC - CN = 12 - 4 = 8, we have NK = (8/12) * 4 = 8/3.\n    * Area(NKJ) = (1/2) * JK * NK = (1/2) * JK * (8/3) = (4/3) * JK.\n**4. Find the area of pentagon CMJKN:**\nArea(CMJKN) = Area(ABC) - Area(AMC) - Area(BNC) + Area(MJK) + Area(NKJ)\n*  Area(CMJKN) = 30 - 10 - 24 + (2/5) * JK + (4/3) * JK \n*  Area(CMJKN) = -4 + (22/15) * JK\n**5. Find JK:**\nTo find JK, we can use the Pythagorean theorem on either triangle MJK or triangle NKJ.  Let's use triangle MJK:\n*  JK\u00b2 = MK\u00b2 + MJ\u00b2\n*  JK\u00b2 = (AB - AK)\u00b2 + (4/5)\u00b2\n*  JK\u00b2 = (13 - AK)\u00b2 + 16/25\nWe also know that MK/AM = JK/AC (from similar triangles).  Therefore, MK = (JK/5) * 1. \nSubstituting this into the equation above, we get:\n* JK\u00b2 = (13 - (JK/5))\u00b2 + 16/25\n* JK\u00b2 = 169 - 26(JK/5) + JK\u00b2/25 + 16/25\n* (24/25) * JK\u00b2 = 169 - 26(JK/5) + 16/25\n* 24JK\u00b2 = 4225 - 130JK + 16 \n* 24JK\u00b2 + 130JK - 4241 = 0\nWe can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:\n* JK = (-130 \u00b1 \u221a(130\u00b2 - 4 * 24 * -4241)) / (2 * 24) \n* JK = (-130 \u00b1 \u221a(415676)) / 48\n* JK = (-130 \u00b1 644.87) / 48\nSince JK must be positive, we take the positive solution:\n* JK \u2248 10.727\n**6. Calculate the area of the pentagon:**\nFinally, we can substitute JK back into our expression for the area of the pentagon:\n* Area(CMJKN) = -4 + (22/15) * 10.727 \n* Area(CMJKN) = -4 + 15.69 \n* Area(CMJKN) = **11.69**\nTherefore, the area of pentagon CMJKN is **11.69**.  Since we want the answer as a common fraction, the answer is **1169/100**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the area of triangle ABC**\nSince we know the sides of triangle ABC, we can use Heron's formula to find its area. \n* **Semiperimeter:**  s = (AB + AC + BC)/2 = (13 + 5 + 12)/2 = 15\n* **Area:**  Area of triangle ABC = \u221a(s(s-AB)(s-AC)(s-BC)) = \u221a(15(15-13)(15-5)(15-12)) = \u221a(15*2*10*3) = 30\n**2. Find the areas of triangles AMC and BNC**\n* **AMC:** We know AC = 5 and CM = 4.  Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we can find AM: AM = \u221a(AC\u00b2 - CM\u00b2) = \u221a(5\u00b2 - 4\u00b2) = 3.  Therefore, the area of triangle AMC is (1/2)*AM*CM = (1/2)*3*4 = 6.\n* **BNC:**  Similarly, we can find BN: BN = \u221a(BC\u00b2 - CN\u00b2) = \u221a(12\u00b2 - 4\u00b2) = \u221a(128) = 8\u221a2.  The area of triangle BNC is (1/2)*BN*CN = (1/2)*8\u221a2*4 = 16\u221a2.\n**3. Find the area of quadrilateral CMJN**\nSince MJ is perpendicular to AB, triangle CMJ is a right triangle.  We know CM = 4 and we can find CJ using the Pythagorean Theorem: CJ = \u221a(AC\u00b2 - AJ\u00b2) = \u221a(5\u00b2 - 3\u00b2) = 4.  The area of triangle CMJ is (1/2)*CM*CJ = (1/2)*4*4 = 8.\n**4. Find the area of quadrilateral CNKN**\nSimilarly, triangle CNK is a right triangle. We know CN = 4 and we can find CK using the Pythagorean Theorem: CK = \u221a(BC\u00b2 - BK\u00b2) = \u221a(12\u00b2 - 8\u221a2\u00b2) = 4\u221a2.  The area of triangle CNK is (1/2)*CN*CK = (1/2)*4*4\u221a2 = 8\u221a2.\n**5. Find the area of pentagon CMJKN**\nThe area of pentagon CMJKN is the sum of the areas of the triangles and quadrilaterals we've calculated:\nArea of pentagon CMJKN = Area of triangle AMC + Area of triangle BNC + Area of quadrilateral CMJN + Area of quadrilateral CNKN = 6 + 16\u221a2 + 8 + 8\u221a2 = **24 + 24\u221a2**. \n",

Calculate Areas**\nNow we can find the areas of the individual shapes:\n* **Area of triangle $CMJ$:** $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 4 \\cdot \\frac{9}{2} = 9$\n* **Area of triangle $CNK$:** $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 4 \\cdot \\frac{9}{2} = 9$\n* **Area of triangle $ABC$:** $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 5 \\cdot 12 = 30$\n**6.  Find the Area of Pentagon CMJKN**\nThe area of pentagon $CMJKN$ is the sum of the areas of triangles $CMJ$, $CNK$, and $ABC$ minus the area of triangle $ACB$:\nArea of pentagon $CMJKN$ = 9 + 9 + 30 - 30 = $\\boxed{9}$ \n",
