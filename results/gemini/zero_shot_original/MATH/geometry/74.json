        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Situation**\nImagine the golf balls stacked vertically in the box. Since they are touching each other and the ends of the box, the height of the box is equal to three times the diameter of a golf ball.\n**2. Find the Diameter**\n* The height of the box is 13.5 cm.\n* Three golf ball diameters fit within that height.\n* Therefore, the diameter of one golf ball is 13.5 cm / 3 = 4.5 cm.\n**3. Calculate the Circumference**\n* The circumference of a circle is given by the formula:  Circumference = \u03c0 * diameter\n* We know the diameter is 4.5 cm.\n* Therefore, the circumference of each golf ball is \u03c0 * 4.5 cm = **(9/2)\u03c0 cm**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n* **Visualize:** Imagine the three golf balls stacked in the box. The height of the box is the same as the combined height of the three golf balls.\n* **Height of one golf ball:** Since there are three golf balls, each golf ball has a height of 13.5 cm / 3 = 4.5 cm.\n* **Diameter of one golf ball:** The height of a golf ball is equal to its diameter. So, the diameter of each golf ball is 4.5 cm.\n* **Circumference of one golf ball:** The circumference of a circle is found using the formula  C = \u03c0d, where C is the circumference and d is the diameter. Therefore, the circumference of one golf ball is \u03c0 * 4.5 cm = **9\u03c0/2 cm**. \n**Answer:** The circumference of each golf ball is **9\u03c0/2 cm**. \n",

Since they are touching each other and the ends of the box, the height of the box is equal to three times the diameter of a golf ball.\n**2. Find the Diameter**\n* Height of the box = 13.5 cm\n* Height of the box = 3 * diameter of a golf ball\n* Diameter of a golf ball = 13.5 cm / 3 = 4.5 cm\n**3. Find the Circumference**\n* Circumference of a circle = \u03c0 * diameter\n* Circumference of a golf ball = \u03c0 * 4.5 cm = **(9/2)\u03c0 cm** \n**Answer:** The circumference of each golf ball is **(9/2)\u03c0** centimeters. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n* **Visualize:** Imagine the three golf balls stacked vertically.  The height of the box is equal to three times the diameter of a single golf ball.\n* **Calculate the diameter:** Since the height of the box is 13.5 cm, the diameter of a single golf ball is 13.5 cm / 3 = 4.5 cm.\n* **Calculate the circumference:** The circumference of a circle is given by the formula C = \u03c0d, where d is the diameter.  Therefore, the circumference of each golf ball is \u03c0 * 4.5 cm = **(9/2)\u03c0 cm**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Visualize the Setup**\nImagine the box.  Since the golf balls touch the ends of the box and each other, we can see that the height of the box is equal to three times the diameter of a single golf ball.\n**2. Calculate the Diameter of a Golf Ball**\n* The height of the box is 13.5 cm, and this is equal to three diameters.\n* Divide the box height by 3 to find the diameter of one golf ball: 13.5 cm / 3 = 4.5 cm\n**3. Calculate the Circumference**\n* The circumference of a circle is found using the formula: Circumference = \u03c0 * diameter.\n* Substitute the diameter we found: Circumference = \u03c0 * 4.5 cm\n**4. Express the Answer as a Fraction**\n* The circumference of each golf ball is **9\u03c0/2 cm**. \n"
