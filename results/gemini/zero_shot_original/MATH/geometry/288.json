    "solution": "Since $V$ is the midpoint of $PR,$ then $PV=VR.$  Since $UVRW$ is a parallelogram, then $VR=UW.$ Since $W$ is the midpoint of $US,$ then $UW=WS.$\n\nThus, $$PV=VR=UW=WS.$$ Similarly, $$QW=WR=UV=VT.$$ Also, $R$ is the midpoint of $TS$ and therefore, $TR=RS.$ Thus, $\\triangle VTR$ is congruent to $\\triangle WRS$, and so the two triangles have equal area.\n\nDiagonal $VW$ in parallelogram $UVRW$ divides the area of the parallelogram in half. Therefore, $\\triangle UVW$ and $\\triangle RWV$ have equal areas.\n\nIn quadrilateral $VRSW,$ $VR=WS$ and $VR$ is parallel to $WS.$ Thus, $VRSW$ is a parallelogram and the area of $\\triangle RWV$ is equal to the area of $\\triangle WRS.$ Therefore, $\\triangle VTR,$ $\\triangle WRS,$ $\\triangle RWV,$ and $\\triangle UVW$ have equal areas, and so these four triangles divide $\\triangle STU$ into quarters.\n\nParallelogram $UVRW$ is made from two of these four quarters of $\\triangle STU,$ or one half of $\\triangle STU.$ The area of parallelogram $UVRW$ is thus half of $1,$ or $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}.$",

        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Understanding Midpoints and Area**\n* **Midpoints:** When you connect the midpoints of two sides of a triangle, you create a segment that is parallel to the third side and half its length. \n* **Area of Triangles:**  The area of a triangle is half the product of its base and height.\n**2. Analyzing the Diagram**\n* **Triangle Similarity:**  Notice that $\\triangle PQR$ and $\\triangle UVR$ are similar triangles (because they have parallel sides). Since $U$, $V$, and $W$ are midpoints, the sides of $\\triangle UVR$ are half the length of the corresponding sides of $\\triangle PQR$.\n* **Area Relationship:**  The ratio of the areas of similar figures is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. So, the area of $\\triangle UVR$ is $(1/2)^2 = 1/4$ the area of $\\triangle PQR$.\n**3.  Finding the Area of Parallelogram UVRW**\n* **Area of Triangle UVR:** Since the area of $\\triangle PQR$ is 1, the area of $\\triangle UVR$ is 1/4.\n* **Area of Parallelogram UVRW:**  Parallelogram $UVRW$ is made up of two triangles: $\\triangle UVR$ and $\\triangle UWR$.  Since $\\triangle UWR$ is also half the size of $\\triangle PQR$, its area is 1/4. \n* **Total Area:** The area of parallelogram $UVRW$ is the sum of the areas of the two triangles: 1/4 + 1/4 = **1/2**. \n**Therefore, the area of parallelogram $UVRW$ is 1/2.** \n",

Analyzing the Triangles**\n* **Triangle PQR:** Since U, W, and V are midpoints, triangles UWV, VQP, and WRP are all congruent (same shape and size) and each has half the area of triangle PQR.

The Parallelogram**\n* **Base and Height:**  Notice that parallelogram UVRW has base UV and height WR.  Since UV is half the length of side PQ in triangle PQR, and WR is half the length of side ST in triangle STU, the base and height of the parallelogram are half the base and height of the original triangles. \n* **Area:** The area of a parallelogram is base times height.  Since the base and height of the parallelogram are half the base and height of the original triangles, the area of the parallelogram is (1/2)*(1/2) = **1/4**.\n**Therefore, the area of parallelogram UVRW is 1/4.** \n",
