        "Here's how to find the area of the pentagon:\n**1. Divide the Pentagon**\n* Draw a vertical line from the top vertex of the pentagon down to the base. This divides the pentagon into a rectangle and a triangle.\n**2. Calculate the Rectangle's Area**\n* The rectangle has a length of 8 inches and a width of 12 inches.\n* Area of rectangle = length * width = 8 inches * 12 inches = 96 square inches\n**3. Calculate the Triangle's Area**\n* The triangle has a base of 8 inches.\n* The height of the triangle is the difference between the 18-inch side of the pentagon and the 12-inch side of the rectangle: 18 inches - 12 inches = 6 inches.\n* Area of triangle = (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 8 inches * 6 inches = 24 square inches\n**4. Add the Areas**\n* Total area of the pentagon = area of rectangle + area of triangle = 96 square inches + 24 square inches = **120 square inches** \n",
        "Here's how to find the area of the pentagon:\n**1. Divide the Pentagon**\n* Draw a line segment from the top vertex (where the \"6''\" label is) down to the base of the pentagon. This divides the pentagon into a rectangle and a triangle.\n**2. Calculate the Area of the Rectangle**\n* The rectangle has a length of 8 inches and a width of 12 inches.\n* Area of rectangle = length \u00d7 width = 8 inches \u00d7 12 inches = 96 square inches\n**3. Calculate the Area of the Triangle**\n* The base of the triangle is 8 inches (the same as the width of the rectangle).\n* The height of the triangle is 18 inches - 12 inches = 6 inches.\n* Area of triangle = (1/2) \u00d7 base \u00d7 height = (1/2) \u00d7 8 inches \u00d7 6 inches = 24 square inches\n**4.
