        "### Instruction: right triangle $ABC$ with $\\angle B = 90^\\circ$, we have $\\sin A = 2\\cos A$.  What is $\\tan A$?\n### Response:\n**1. Understand the trigonometric ratios:**\n* **Sine (sin):**  The ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse.  (sin A = opposite / hypotenuse)\n* **Cosine (cos):** The ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse.  (cos A = adjacent / hypotenuse)\n* **Tangent (tan):** The ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side. (tan A = opposite / adjacent)\n**2. Use the given information:**\nWe know  sin A = 2 cos A.  Let's express this in terms of the sides of the triangle:\n* sin A = opposite / hypotenuse = 2 \n* cos A = adjacent / hypotenuse\n**3. Solve for the ratio of opposite to adjacent:**\nSince we want to find tan A (opposite / adjacent), we can divide the equation sin A = 2 cos A by cos A:\n(sin A) / (cos A) = (2 cos A) / (cos A)\n**4. Simplify:**\nThis simplifies to:\ntan A = 2\n**Therefore, tan A = 2** \n",

Understand the trigonometric ratios:**\n* **sin A = opposite side / hypotenuse**\n* **cos A = adjacent side / hypotenuse**\n* **tan A = opposite side / adjacent side**\n**2. Use the given information:**\nWe are given that sin A = 2 cos A.  Let's substitute the trigonometric ratios:\n(opposite side / hypotenuse) = 2 (adjacent side / hypotenuse)\n**3. Simplify the equation:**\nSince the hypotenuse is the same in both terms, we can cancel it out:\nopposite side = 2 * adjacent side\n**4. Relate to tangent:**\nWe know that tan A = opposite side / adjacent side.  From our simplified equation, we have:\nopposite side / adjacent side = (2 * adjacent side) / adjacent side\n**5. Solve for tan A:**\nThe adjacent side cancels out, leaving us with:\ntan A = **2** \n**Therefore, tan A = 2.** \n",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Trigonometric Ratios**\n* **Sine (sin):**  In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the hypotenuse. \n* **Cosine (cos):**  In a right triangle, the cosine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the side adjacent to the angle to the length of the hypotenuse.\n* **Tangent (tan):** In a right triangle, the tangent of an angle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle.\n**2. Use the Given Information**\nWe are given that $\\sin A = 2\\cos A$.  Let's represent the sides of the triangle:\n*  Let the side opposite angle *A* be *a*\n*  Let the side adjacent to angle *A* be *b*\n*  Let the hypotenuse be *c*\nUsing the trigonometric ratios, we can write:\n*  sin A = a/c\n*  cos A = b/c\n**3. Substitute and Solve**\nSubstitute these expressions into the given equation:\na/c = 2(b/c)\nSince the denominators are the same, we can cancel them:\na = 2b\n**4. Find tan A**\nRecall that tan A = a/b.  We now know that a = 2b. Substitute this into the tangent formula:\ntan A = (2b)/b = 2\n**Answer:** Therefore,  tan A = **2**. \n",

Understand the Relationship:**\n* Recall the definitions of sine, cosine, and tangent in a right triangle:\n    *  sin A = (opposite side to angle A) / (hypotenuse)\n    *  cos A = (adjacent side to angle A) / (hypotenuse)\n    *  tan A = (opposite side to angle A) / (adjacent side to angle A) \n**2. Use the Given Information:**\n* We are given sin A = 2cos A. This means the length of the opposite side is twice the length of the adjacent side.\n**3. Visualize the Triangle:**\n* Draw a right triangle ABC with angle B as the right angle. \n* Let the length of the adjacent side (BC) be 'x'.\n* Then, the length of the opposite side (AC) is '2x'.\n**4. Find the Hypotenuse:**\n* Use the Pythagorean theorem:  (hypotenuse)\u00b2 = (opposite)\u00b2 + (adjacent)\u00b2\n*  (AB)\u00b2 = (2x)\u00b2 + (x)\u00b2\n*  (AB)\u00b2 = 5x\u00b2\n*  AB = x\u221a5  (Since length cannot be negative)\n**5. Calculate tan A:**\n* Now we have all the sides of the triangle.\n* tan A = (opposite) / (adjacent) = (2x) / (x) = **2**\n**Therefore, tan A = 2** \n"
