    "solution": "A central angle of $75^\\circ$ cuts off an arc that is $\\frac{75}{360} = \\frac{5}{24}$ of the circumference of the circle.  Since $\\frac{5}{24}$ of the circle's circumference is $10\\pi$, the entire circumference of the circle is  $10\\pi \\cdot \\frac{24}{5} = 48\\pi$.  Therefore, the diameter of the circle is 48, and the radius of the circle is $\\boxed{24}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Relationship**\n* **Arc Length:** The length of a curved portion of a circle's circumference.\n* **Central Angle:** The angle formed at the center of the circle by two radii that intersect the arc's endpoints.\n* **Radius:** The distance from the center of the circle to any point on the circle.\nThe key relationship is: **Arc Length = (Central Angle / 360\u00b0) * Circumference**\n**2.  Set up the Equation**\nWe know:\n* Central Angle = 75\u00b0\n* Arc Length = 10\u03c0 feet\n* Circumference = 2\u03c0r (where 'r' is the radius)\nSubstitute these values into the relationship:\n10\u03c0 = (75\u00b0/360\u00b0) * 2\u03c0r\n**3. Solve for the Radius (r)**\n* Simplify the equation: 10\u03c0 = (1/4.8) * 2\u03c0r\n* Multiply both sides by 4.8: 48\u03c0 = 2\u03c0r\n* Divide both sides by 2\u03c0: 24 = r\n**Answer:** The radius of the circle is **24 feet**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Relationship**\n* **Central Angle:** An angle whose vertex is at the center of the circle.\n* **Intercepted Arc:** The portion of the circle's circumference cut off by the central angle.\n* **Arc Length:** The distance along the curved path of the intercepted arc.\nThe key relationship is:  **Arc length = (central angle/360\u00b0) * circumference**\n**2. Apply the Relationship**\n* We know the central angle is 75\u00b0 and the arc length is 10\u03c0 feet. Let's represent the radius of the circle as 'r'.\n* The circumference of the circle is 2\u03c0r.\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\n10\u03c0 = (75\u00b0/360\u00b0) * 2\u03c0r\n**3. Solve for the Radius**\n* Simplify the equation: 10\u03c0 = (1/4.8) * 2\u03c0r\n* Divide both sides by 2\u03c0: 5 = (1/4.8) * r\n* Multiply both sides by 4.8: r = 24\n**Answer:** The radius of the circle is **24 feet**. \n",
