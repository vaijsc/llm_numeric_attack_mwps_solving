    "solution": "Recall that a median of a triangle is a line segment drawn from a vertex of the triangle to the midpoint of the opposite side.  The three medians of a triangle intersect in a common point called the centroid of the triangle.  The centroid divides each median into two segments whose lengths have ratio 2:1.\n\nCall the four vertices of the tetrahedron $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$.  Also, define $E$ to be the midpoint of $AB$ and $M$ to be the centroid of triangle $ABC$.  Let $s$ be the side length of the tetrahedron.  From the Pythagorean theorem applied to right triangle $AEC$, we find that $CE=\\sqrt{s^2-(s/2)^2}=s\\sqrt{3}/2$.  Since $M$ is the centroid of triangle $ABC$, $AM=\\frac{2}{3}(CE)=\\frac{2}{3}\\left(\\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)=\\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{3}$.  Finally, applying the Pythagorean theorem to $AMD$, we find $\\left(\\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\right)^2+DM^2=s^2$.  Substituting $20$ inches for $DM$, we solve to find $s=\\boxed{10\\sqrt{6}}$ inches.\n\n[asy]\n\nimport three;\n\nsize(2.5inch);\n\ncurrentprojection = orthographic(1/3,-1,1/4);\n\ntriple A = (0,0,0);\n\ntriple B = (1,0,0);\n\ntriple C = (0.5,sqrt(3)/2,0);\n\ntriple D = (0.5,sqrt(3)/4,sqrt(6)/3);\n\ntriple E = (1/2,0,0);\n\ntriple M = (0.5,sqrt(3)/6,0);\n\ndot(A); dot(B); dot(C); dot(D); dot(M); dot(E);\n\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,SW); label(\"$B$\",B,SE); label(\"$C$\",C,S); label(\"$D$\",D,N);\n\nlabel(\"$M$\",M,SE); label(\"$E$\",E,S);\n\ndraw(A--B--C--D--A--C);\n\ndraw(B--D);\n\ndraw(D--M);\n\ndraw(M--A);\n\ndraw(C--E,dashed);\n\n[/asy]",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Tetrahedron**\nImagine a regular tetrahedron.  Its height (20 inches) goes from the apex (the top point) straight down to the center of the base.  This height divides the base equilateral triangle into three congruent smaller triangles.\n**2. Focus on a Right Triangle**\nIf you draw a line from the apex to one of the vertices of the base, you create a right triangle. The height of the tetrahedron is one leg of this right triangle. The other leg is the line segment from the center of the base to the midpoint of one of the sides of the base.\n**3. Find the Base of the Right Triangle**\nLet the length of an edge of the tetrahedron be *s*.  The equilateral base triangle has side length *s*.  The line segment from the center to the midpoint of a side is an altitude of this equilateral triangle.  This altitude divides the equilateral triangle into two 30-60-90 right triangles.\n* In a 30-60-90 triangle, the hypotenuse is twice the length of the shorter leg, and the longer leg is the square root of 3 times the length of the shorter leg.\n* The shorter leg of the 30-60-90 triangle in our base is half the side length of the equilateral triangle, which is *s/2*.\n* The longer leg (our base of the big right triangle) is \u221a3 times the shorter leg, so it is (\u221a3)(*s/2*) = (\u221a3*s)/2.\n**4. Use the Pythagorean Theorem**\nNow we have a right triangle with legs of length 20 inches and (\u221a3*s)/2 inches, and hypotenuse of length *s/2*. We can use the Pythagorean Theorem:\n   *  (20)\u00b2 + ((\u221a3*s)/2)\u00b2 = (s/2)\u00b2\n   *  400 + (3s\u00b2/4) = s\u00b2/4\n   *  400 = s\u00b2/4 - 3s\u00b2/4\n   *  400 = -s\u00b2/2\n   *  -800 = s\u00b2\n   *  s = \u221a(-800) = \u221a(-1 * 800) = \u221a(-1) * \u221a800 = 20\u221a2 * i  \nSince we're dealing with a physical length, we discard the imaginary solution and take the positive square root.\n**5. The Answer**\nThe length of each edge of the tetrahedron is **20\u221a2 inches**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Tetrahedron**\nImagine a regular tetrahedron.  It has four equilateral triangular faces, and its height is the perpendicular distance from one vertex to the center of the opposite face.\n**2. Focus on a Right Triangle**\nIf we draw a line from the top vertex to the center of the base, and then a line from that center to the midpoint of a base edge, we form a right triangle.  \n* The height of the tetrahedron (20 inches) is one leg of this right triangle.\n* The base of this right triangle is half the length of a base edge. Let's call this length *x*.\n**3. Find the Hypotenuse**\nThe hypotenuse of this right triangle is the slant height of the tetrahedron.  This slant height is also the height of one of the equilateral triangle faces. \nTo find the slant height, we can use the fact that the center of an equilateral triangle divides each median (and altitude) in a 2:1 ratio. Since the height of the tetrahedron is 20 inches, the slant height is 2/3 * 20 = 40/3 inches.\n**4. Use the Pythagorean Theorem**\nNow we can use the Pythagorean Theorem on the right triangle we identified earlier:\n(20 inches)\u00b2 + (x/2)\u00b2 = (40/3 inches)\u00b2\n**5. Solve for x**\nSimplify and solve for *x*:\n* 400 + x\u00b2/4 = 1600/9\n* x\u00b2/4 = 1600/9 - 400 = 1600/9 - 3600/9 = -2000/9\n* x\u00b2 = -8000/9  (This is impossible, since a length cannot be negative)\n**6.  Recognize the Error**\nWe have a problem! The equation gives us a negative value for x\u00b2. This means we made an error somewhere. The issue lies in assuming the center of the base triangle is where the height intersects the base.  The height actually intersects the base at the centroid, which is a different point than the center. \n**7.  Using the Centroid**\n* The centroid divides each median of the equilateral triangle in a 2:1 ratio. \n* Since the height of the tetrahedron intersects the base at the centroid, the distance from the centroid to a midpoint of an edge is 1/3 of the height of the equilateral triangle.\nLet *s* be the length of each edge of the tetrahedron.  The height of the equilateral triangle is *s*\u221a3/2. Therefore, the distance from the centroid to a midpoint of an edge is (1/3) * (s\u221a3/2) = s\u221a3/6.\n**8.  Apply the Pythagorean Theorem Again**\nNow we can use the Pythagorean Theorem with the correct values:\n* (20 inches)\u00b2 + (s\u221a3/6)\u00b2 = (s\u221a3/2)\u00b2\n**9.  Solve for s**\nSimplify and solve for *s*:\n* 400 + 3s\u00b2/36 = 3s\u00b2/4\n* 400 = 3s\u00b2/4 - 3s\u00b2/36 = 24s\u00b2/36\n* 400 = 2s\u00b2/3\n* 600 = s\u00b2\n* s = \u221a600 = 10\u221a6 \n**Answer:**\nThe length of each edge of the tetrahedron is **10\u221a6 inches**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Tetrahedron**\nImagine a regular tetrahedron. It has four faces, each an equilateral triangle. The height of the tetrahedron is the perpendicular distance from the apex (top point) to the base.\n**2.  Divide the Tetrahedron into Sections**\nDraw a line segment from the apex to the center of the base. This line segment is the height of the tetrahedron. Now, draw a line segment from the apex to one of the vertices (corners) of the base. This forms a right triangle.\n**3. Analyze the Right Triangle**\n* The hypotenuse of this right triangle is an edge of the tetrahedron.\n* The shorter leg of the right triangle is half the length of a side of the base equilateral triangle.\n* The longer leg of the right triangle is the height of the tetrahedron (20 inches).\n**4.  Use Geometry**\nLet's use some geometry to relate these lengths.\n* **Equilateral Triangle Properties:** In an equilateral triangle, the height divides the base into two equal segments. The height also bisects the angle at the apex, creating two 30-60-90 right triangles.\n* **30-60-90 Triangle Ratios:** In a 30-60-90 right triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1:\u221a3:2.  \n**5.  Apply the Ratios**\nSince the height of the tetrahedron is 20 inches, and it's the longer leg of the 30-60-90 triangle, the shorter leg is 20/\u221a3 inches.  \n**6.  Find the Edge Length**\nThe shorter leg of the 30-60-90 triangle is half the length of a side of the base equilateral triangle. Therefore, the side length of the base equilateral triangle is 2(20/\u221a3) = 40/\u221a3 inches.\nFinally, the hypotenuse of the right triangle (which is the edge of the tetrahedron) is twice the length of the shorter leg:\nEdge length = 2 * (20/\u221a3) = **40/\u221a3 inches**\n**7.  Rationalize the Denominator**\nTo express the answer in simplest radical form, rationalize the denominator:\nEdge length = (40/\u221a3) * (\u221a3/\u221a3) = **(40\u221a3)/3 inches** \n",

Find the Base of the Right Triangle**\n* The base of the tetrahedron is an equilateral triangle.  Let the side length of this triangle be *s*.\n* The center of an equilateral triangle is also its centroid (the point where the medians intersect). The centroid divides each median in a 2:1 ratio. \n* Therefore, the distance from the center of the base to the midpoint of a side of the base is (2/3) * (s/2) = s/3.\n**3. Use the Pythagorean Theorem**\n* We now have a right triangle with:\n    * Height = 20 inches\n    * Base = s/3\n    * Hypotenuse = s/2 (half the length of an edge of the tetrahedron)\n* Applying the Pythagorean theorem:\n    (s/3)\u00b2 + 20\u00b2 = (s/2)\u00b2\n**4. Solve for s**\n* Simplify the equation:\n    s\u00b2/9 + 400 = s\u00b2/4\n* Multiply both sides by 36 to get rid of the fractions:\n    4s\u00b2 + 14400 = 9s\u00b2\n* Combine like terms:\n    5s\u00b2 = 14400\n* Solve for s:\n    s\u00b2 = 2880\n    s = \u221a2880 = \u221a(144 * 20) = **12\u221a20 inches**\n**Therefore, the length of each edge of the tetrahedron is 12\u221a20 inches.** \n",
