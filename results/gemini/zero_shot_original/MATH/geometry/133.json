    "solution": "We draw a regular hexagon and one of its longest diagonals: [asy]\nsize(80);\ndraw((0,0)--(1,0)--(1.5,.5*sqrt(3))--(1,sqrt(3))--(0,sqrt(3))--(-.5,.5*sqrt(3))--cycle);\ndraw((1,0)--(0,sqrt(3)));\n[/asy] Now we draw in the other two long diagonals.  We have split the hexagon into six equilateral triangles, which are congruent by symmetry.  [asy]\nsize(80);\ndraw((0,0)--(1,0)--(1.5,.5*sqrt(3))--(1,sqrt(3))--(0,sqrt(3))--(-.5,.5*sqrt(3))--cycle);\ndraw((1,0)--(0,sqrt(3))); draw((1.5,.5*sqrt(3))--(-.5,.5*sqrt(3))); draw((1,sqrt(3))--(0,0));\n[/asy] We see that two side lengths make up one long diagonal.  Let the hexagon's side length be $s$, then, its long diagonal has length $2s$ and its perimeter has length $6s$.  The ratio of its long diagonal to its perimeter is hence $\\frac{2s}{6s}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Visualize the Hexagon**\nImagine a regular hexagon. It has six equal sides and six equal interior angles. Draw a diagonal that connects two opposite vertices (corners).  This is the longest diagonal.\n**2. Divide the Hexagon**\nThe longest diagonal divides the hexagon into two congruent trapezoids.  Each trapezoid has two parallel sides: a side of the hexagon and the longest diagonal.\n**3. Focus on a Trapezoid**\nConsider one of the trapezoids.  Let:\n*  *s* = the length of a side of the hexagon\n*  *d* = the length of the longest diagonal\n**4. Apply Geometry**\n* The angle at the top of the trapezoid (where two sides of the hexagon meet) is 120 degrees (since each interior angle of a regular hexagon is 120 degrees).\n* The two base angles of the trapezoid are each 60 degrees (since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees).\n* This makes the trapezoid a 30-60-90 right triangle. \n**5. Ratios in a 30-60-90 Triangle**\nIn a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1:\u221a3:2.  In our trapezoid:\n* The shorter leg (half a side of the hexagon) is *s/2*.\n* The longer leg (half the longest diagonal) is (\u221a3/2) *s*.\n* The hypotenuse (a side of the hexagon) is *s*.\n**6. Calculate the Diagonal**\nSince half the longest diagonal is (\u221a3/2) *s*, the full diagonal *d* is \u221a3 *s*.\n**7. Find the Perimeter**\nThe perimeter of the hexagon is 6*s.\n**8. The Ratio**\nThe ratio of the longest diagonal to the perimeter is:\n*d / (6s) = (\u221a3 *s) / (6s) = **\u221a3 / 6**\n**Answer:** The ratio of the measure of a regular hexagon's longest diagonal to the measure of its perimeter is **\u221a3 / 6**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Understand the Properties of a Regular Hexagon**\n* A regular hexagon has six equal sides and six equal angles.\n* Each interior angle of a regular hexagon measures 120 degrees.\n**2.  Visualize the Longest Diagonal**\n* The longest diagonal of a regular hexagon divides it into two equilateral triangles.\n**3.  Find the Relationship between Diagonal and Side**\n* In an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal, and the longest diagonal of the hexagon is twice the length of a side.\n**4.  Calculate the Perimeter**\n* The perimeter of the hexagon is 6 times the length of one side.\n**5.  Express the Ratio**\n* Let the side length of the hexagon be 's'.\n* The longest diagonal is 2s.\n* The perimeter is 6s.\n* The ratio of the longest diagonal to the perimeter is (2s)/(6s) = **1/3**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize a Regular Hexagon**\nA regular hexagon has six equal sides and six equal angles.  Imagine drawing a hexagon and then drawing one of its longest diagonals (a line segment connecting two opposite vertices).\n**2. Divide the Hexagon**\nThe longest diagonal divides the hexagon into two congruent trapezoids. \n**3. Focus on One Trapezoid**\nConsider one of these trapezoids. Its base angles are 120 degrees (since each angle of a regular hexagon is 120 degrees).  The shorter base of the trapezoid is one side of the hexagon, and the longer base is the longest diagonal.\n**4. Use Geometry**\n* **Equilateral Triangle:**  The longer base of the trapezoid, which is the longest diagonal of the hexagon, is also the base of an equilateral triangle formed by connecting two adjacent vertices of the hexagon and the endpoint of the diagonal.\n* **30-60-90 Triangle:** Draw a perpendicular from one of the top vertices of the trapezoid to the longer base. This creates a 30-60-90 right triangle.  The shorter leg of this triangle is half the side length of the hexagon, and the hypotenuse is the side length of the hexagon.\n**5. Find the Ratio**\n* **Longest Diagonal:** The longer base of the trapezoid is equal to the side length of the equilateral triangle, which is twice the shorter leg of the 30-60-90 triangle. So, the longest diagonal is equal to the side length of the hexagon multiplied by the square root of 3.\n* **Perimeter:** The perimeter of the hexagon is 6 times the side length.\n**6. Express the Ratio**\nThe ratio of the longest diagonal to the perimeter is:\n(side length * \u221a3) / (6 * side length) = **\u221a3 / 6** \nTherefore, the ratio of the measure of a regular hexagon's longest diagonal to the measure of its perimeter is **\u221a3 / 6**. \n",

The Longest Diagonal**\nThe longest diagonal of a regular hexagon connects two opposite vertices (corners).  It divides the hexagon into two congruent trapezoids.\n**3.  Equilateral Triangles**\nIf you draw lines from the center of the hexagon to each vertex, you create six equilateral triangles.  Each side of these triangles is equal to a side of the hexagon.\n**4.  Finding the Diagonal Length**\n* Consider one of the equilateral triangles. The longest diagonal of the hexagon is the base of this triangle.\n* Since the triangle is equilateral, the base (the diagonal) is twice the length of one of its sides (which is equal to a side of the hexagon).\n**5.  Perimeter**\nThe perimeter of the hexagon is the sum of the lengths of its six sides. \n**6.  The Ratio**\n* Let 's' represent the length of one side of the hexagon.\n* The longest diagonal has a length of 2s.\n* The perimeter is 6s.\nTherefore, the ratio of the longest diagonal to the perimeter is:\n(2s) / (6s) = **1/3** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Hexagon**\nDraw a regular hexagon.  A regular hexagon has six equal sides and six equal angles.  \n**2. Identify the Longest Diagonal**\nThe longest diagonal of a regular hexagon connects two opposite vertices (corners). \n**3. Divide the Hexagon**\nDraw the longest diagonal.  Notice that this diagonal divides the hexagon into two congruent trapezoids.\n**4. Focus on One Trapezoid**\nLet's focus on one of these trapezoids.  The longest diagonal of the hexagon is now one of the bases of the trapezoid.  The other base of the trapezoid is a side of the hexagon.\n**5.  Find the Trapezoid's Height**\nDraw a perpendicular from one of the top vertices of the trapezoid down to the longer base.  This is the height of the trapezoid.  Notice that this height and half of the shorter base form a 30-60-90 right triangle.\n**6. Use the 30-60-90 Triangle Ratios**\nIn a 30-60-90 triangle, the hypotenuse is twice the length of the shorter leg, and the longer leg is the square root of 3 times the length of the shorter leg.\n* Since half the shorter base of the trapezoid is the shorter leg of the 30-60-90 triangle, let's call this length *x*.\n* The longer leg of the 30-60-90 triangle (the height of the trapezoid) is then *x\u221a3*.\n* The hypotenuse of the 30-60-90 triangle (half the longest diagonal of the hexagon) is *2x*.\n**7. Express the Longest Diagonal and Perimeter in Terms of *x***\n* **Longest Diagonal:**  The whole longest diagonal is *4x*.\n* **Perimeter:** The perimeter of the hexagon is 6 times the length of a side.  Since each side is equal to the shorter base of the trapezoid, the perimeter is *6x*.\n**8. Find the Ratio**\nThe ratio of the longest diagonal to the perimeter is:\n (4x) / (6x) = **2/3** \n"
