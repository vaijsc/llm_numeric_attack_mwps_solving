    "solution": "Since the volume of a sphere is directly proportional to its diameter cubed, the ratio of the volume of the ball with a diameter of 4 cm to the volume of the ball with a diameter of 3 cm is $(4/3)^3\n= 64/27$.  Since all of the rubber bands have the same volume, it follows that the number of rubber bands in the ball with diameter 4 is \\[ (4/3)^3 \\cdot 54 = \\frac{64}{27} \\cdot 54 = 64 \\cdot 2 = 128. \\]Therefore the number of rubber bands that Alana needs to add to the ball is $128 - 54 = \\boxed{74}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Relationship:**\n* **Volume and Diameter:**  The volume of a sphere (like our rubber band ball) is directly related to its diameter.  As the diameter increases, the volume increases.\n* **Rubber Bands and Volume:**  Since each rubber band has the same volume, the total volume of the ball is proportional to the number of rubber bands. \n**2. Calculate Volume Ratios:**\n* **Initial Diameter:** The ball starts with a diameter of 3 cm.\n* **Final Diameter:** Alana wants to increase the diameter by 1 cm, so the final diameter will be 3 cm + 1 cm = 4 cm.\n**3. Find the Volume Increase:**\n* **Volume of a sphere:** The formula for the volume of a sphere is (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3, where r is the radius. \n* **Initial Radius:** The initial radius is 3 cm / 2 = 1.5 cm.\n* **Final Radius:** The final radius is 4 cm / 2 = 2 cm.\n* **Initial Volume:**  (4/3)\u03c0(1.5 cm)\u00b3 = 14.137 cm\u00b3 (approximately)\n* **Final Volume:** (4/3)\u03c0(2 cm)\u00b3 = 33.51 cm\u00b3 (approximately)\n* **Volume Increase:** 33.51 cm\u00b3 - 14.137 cm\u00b3 = 19.373 cm\u00b3 (approximately)\n**4. Determine Rubber Band Increase:**\n* **Volume per Rubber Band:** Since the volume of the ball is proportional to the number of rubber bands, the volume increase represents the volume of the rubber bands that need to be added.\n* **Number of Rubber Bands to Add:** To find out how many rubber bands are needed, we'll need to know the volume of a single rubber band.  Unfortunately, we don't have that information in the problem.  Let's assume the volume of one rubber band is 'x' cubic centimeters.\n* **Rubber Band Count:**  The number of rubber bands to add would be (19.373 cm\u00b3) / x.\n**Answer:**\nWithout knowing the volume of a single rubber band (x), we can't determine the exact number of rubber bands Alana needs to add. However, we know that the volume of the rubber bands needed to increase the diameter by 1 cm is approximately 19.373 cm\u00b3. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the volume of the original ball:**\n* The original ball has a diameter of 3 cm, so its radius is 1.5 cm.\n* The volume of a sphere is given by (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3, where r is the radius.\n* The volume of the original ball is (4/3)\u03c0(1.5 cm)\u00b3 = 14.137 cm\u00b3 (approximately).\n**2. Find the volume of the larger ball:**\n* The larger ball has a diameter of 4 cm (3 cm + 1 cm), so its radius is 2 cm.\n* The volume of the larger ball is (4/3)\u03c0(2 cm)\u00b3 = 33.510 cm\u00b3 (approximately).\n**3. Find the difference in volume:**\n* The difference in volume between the two balls is 33.510 cm\u00b3 - 14.137 cm\u00b3 = 19.373 cm\u00b3 (approximately).\n**4. Determine how many rubber bands this difference represents:**\n* Since each rubber band has the same volume, we need to find how many times the volume of a single rubber band fits into the volume difference. \n* We don't know the volume of a single rubber band, but we know that 54 rubber bands make up the original ball's volume (14.137 cm\u00b3).\n* To find the volume of one rubber band, divide the original ball's volume by the number of rubber bands: 14.137 cm\u00b3 / 54 rubber bands \u2248 0.262 cm\u00b3/rubber band.\n* Now, divide the volume difference by the volume of one rubber band to find how many more rubber bands are needed: 19.373 cm\u00b3 / 0.262 cm\u00b3/rubber band \u2248 74 rubber bands.\n**Answer:** Alana should add approximately **74 rubber bands** to increase the diameter of the ball by 1 cm. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Relationship**\n* The problem states that the number of rubber bands is directly related to the volume of the ball.  This means that as the number of rubber bands increases, the volume of the ball increases proportionally.\n**2. Calculate the Volume**\n* We need to find the volume of the ball with 54 rubber bands.  \n* The formula for the volume of a sphere is (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3, where r is the radius.\n* The diameter is 3 cm, so the radius is 1.5 cm.\n* Volume = (4/3)\u03c0(1.5 cm)\u00b3 \u2248 14.14 cm\u00b3\n**3. Determine the New Volume**\n* Alana wants to increase the diameter by 1 cm, making the new diameter 4 cm.\n* The new radius is 2 cm.\n* The new volume = (4/3)\u03c0(2 cm)\u00b3 \u2248 33.51 cm\u00b3\n**4. Calculate the Volume Increase**\n* The volume increase is 33.51 cm\u00b3 - 14.14 cm\u00b3 \u2248 19.37 cm\u00b3\n**5. Find the Number of Rubber Bands Needed**\n* Since the number of rubber bands is proportional to the volume, we can set up a proportion:\n   * 54 rubber bands / 14.14 cm\u00b3 = x rubber bands / 19.37 cm\u00b3\n* Solving for x, we get:\n   * x \u2248 74 rubber bands\n**6. Determine the Number of Rubber Bands to Add**\n* Alana needs to add 74 rubber bands - 54 rubber bands = **20 rubber bands** to increase the diameter by 1 cm. \n",
