        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understanding Isosceles Trapezoids**\n* **Base angles:** An isosceles trapezoid has two pairs of equal base angles. Since one of the smaller base angles is 60 degrees, the other smaller base angle is also 60 degrees. \n* **Symmetry:**  An isosceles trapezoid is symmetrical, so the two legs (non-parallel sides) are congruent. \n**2. Finding the Length of the Legs**\n* **Right Triangles:** The altitude of the trapezoid divides it into two congruent right triangles.\n* **Trigonometry:**  Since the base angle of the right triangle is 60 degrees and the altitude is $2\\sqrt{3}$ inches, we can use trigonometry to find the length of the leg (which is the hypotenuse of the triangle):\n    *  $\\sin 60^\\circ = \\frac{\\text{opposite}}{\\text{hypotenuse}} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{\\text{leg}}$\n    * $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{\\text{leg}}$\n    * $\\text{leg} = 4$ inches\n**3. Finding the Length of the Longer Base**\n* **Parallel Bases:** The longer base of the trapezoid is the shorter base plus twice the length of the segment connecting the midpoints of the two legs. \n* **Midsegment:** This segment is parallel to the bases and half the length of the sum of the bases.  \n* **Applying the Midsegment:** Let the longer base be $x$.  The length of the segment connecting the midpoints is $\\frac{5+x}{2}$. Since this segment is also the leg of the right triangle, we have:\n    * $\\frac{5+x}{2} = 4$\n    * $5+x = 8$\n    * $x = 3$ inches\n**4. Calculating the Perimeter**\n* **Perimeter:** The perimeter of the trapezoid is the sum of the lengths of all its sides:\n    * Perimeter = Shorter base + Longer base + Leg + Leg\n    * Perimeter = 5 inches + 3 inches + 4 inches + 4 inches\n    * **Perimeter = 16 inches**\n**Therefore, the perimeter of the trapezoid is 16 inches.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Geometry**\n* **Isosceles Trapezoid:** An isosceles trapezoid has two parallel sides (bases) and two congruent non-parallel sides.\n* **Base Angles:** The angles at the ends of each base are congruent. \n**2. Draw a Diagram**\n* You've already been provided with a diagram. This is helpful!\n**3. Use Properties of 30-60-90 Triangles**\n* **The 60-degree angle:** Since one base angle is 60 degrees, and the trapezoid is isosceles, the other base angle is also 60 degrees.  \n* **Forming a 30-60-90 Triangle:**  Draw a perpendicular line from the top vertex of the trapezoid to the longer base. This creates a 30-60-90 right triangle.  \n* **30-60-90 Ratios:** In a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1:\u221a3:2. Since the altitude is 2\u221a3, the shorter leg of the triangle is 2, and the hypotenuse (which is also one of the legs of the trapezoid) is 4.\n**4. Find the Lengths of the Bases**\n* **Shorter base:**  We are given that the shorter base is 5 inches.\n* **Longer base:** The longer base is 5 inches + 2 (from the shorter leg of the 30-60-90 triangle) + 2 (from the other shorter leg) = 9 inches.\n**5. Calculate the Perimeter**\n* **Perimeter:**  Perimeter = shorter base + longer base + 2 * (leg of trapezoid) = 5 + 9 + 2 * 4 = **22 inches**\n**Therefore, the perimeter of the trapezoid is 22 inches.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Properties of an Isosceles Trapezoid**\n* **Base Angles:** The two base angles of an isosceles trapezoid on the same side are congruent. \n* **Parallel Sides:** The two bases are parallel.\n* **Legs:** The two non-parallel sides are congruent.\n**2. Draw a Diagram**\nThe provided diagram helps visualize the problem.

Find the Length of the Longer Base**\n* Since the altitude forms a 30-60-90 right triangle with the shorter base and one of the legs, we can use the special properties of 30-60-90 triangles.\n* In a 30-60-90 triangle, the hypotenuse is twice the length of the shorter leg, and the longer leg is $\\sqrt{3}$ times the length of the shorter leg.\n* Therefore, the length of the leg of the trapezoid (AD or BC) is $2\\sqrt{3} \\cdot \\sqrt{3} = 6$ inches.\n* The longer base (AB) is the sum of the shorter base (CD) and twice the length of the leg: 5 + 6 + 6 = 17 inches.\n**4. Calculate the Perimeter**\nThe perimeter of the trapezoid is the sum of all its sides: 5 + 17 + 6 + 6 = **34 inches**. \n",

Use Right Triangles**\n* Triangle $ADE$ is a 30-60-90 right triangle.\n* Since the altitude is $DE = 2\\sqrt{3}$ inches,  we know:\n    * $AE = DE/\\sqrt{3} = 2\\sqrt{3}/\\sqrt{3} = 2$ inches.\n    * $AD = 2 \\cdot AE = 2 \\cdot 2 = 4$ inches.\n**4.

Find the Length of the Longer Base**\n* The difference between the bases is twice the length of the longer leg of the right triangle: 2(6) = 12 inches.\n* The longer base is 5 inches (shorter base) + 12 inches = 17 inches.\n**5. Calculate the Perimeter**\n* Perimeter = shorter base + longer base + 2 * leg\n* Perimeter = 5 + 17 + 2(4\u221a3) = 22 + 8\u221a3 inches\n**Therefore, the perimeter of the trapezoid is 22 + 8\u221a3 inches.** \n"
