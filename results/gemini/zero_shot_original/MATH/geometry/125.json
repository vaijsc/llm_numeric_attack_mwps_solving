        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Setup**\nImagine a square with sides of length 2000.  From each corner, you cut off an isosceles right triangle.  This leaves an octagon in the middle.\n**2. Focus on One Corner**\nLet's look at just one corner of the square. The isosceles right triangle you cut off has a hypotenuse of length 2000 (the side of the square). Since it's an isosceles right triangle, the legs of the triangle are both equal to  2000 / \u221a2.\n**3. Find the Side of the Octagon**\n*  The side of the octagon is formed by the base of the isosceles right triangle plus the length of the square's side minus the hypotenuse of the triangle. \n*  So, the side of the octagon has length: (2000 / \u221a2) + (2000 - 2000) = 2000 / \u221a2\n**4. Simplify the Radical**\nTo simplify the radical, multiply the top and bottom by \u221a2:\n(2000 / \u221a2) * (\u221a2 / \u221a2) = 2000\u221a2 / 2 = 1000\u221a2\n**Answer:** The length of each side of the octagon is **1000\u221a2**. \n",

Focus on One Corner**\nLet's focus on one corner of the square.  The cut-off isosceles right triangle has legs of length *x*.  The hypotenuse of this triangle is also a side of the octagon.\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.2 cm);\npair A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H;\nA = (0,0);\nB = (20,0);\nC = (20,20);\nD = (0,20);\nE = (5,5);\nF = (15,5);\nG = (15,15);\nH = (5,15);\ndraw(A--B--C--D--cycle);\ndraw(E--F--G--H--cycle);\ndraw(A--E);\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, SW);\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, SE);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, NE);\nlabel(\"$D$\", D, NW);\nlabel(\"$E$\", E, SW);\nlabel(\"$F$\", F, SE);\nlabel(\"$G$\", G, NE);\nlabel(\"$H$\", H, NW);\nlabel(\"$x$\", (A + E)/2, W);\nlabel(\"$x$\", (A + E)/2, S);\n[/asy]\n**3. Use the Pythagorean Theorem**\nThe hypotenuse of the isosceles right triangle is the side of the octagon.  Using the Pythagorean Theorem:\n*  (side of octagon)\u00b2 = *x\u00b2 + x\u00b2 = 2x\u00b2\n**4. Find the Relationship between *x* and the Square's Side**\nThe side of the square is made up of two legs of the isosceles right triangle (*x*) plus the side of the octagon.\n* 2000 = *x* + *x* + side of octagon\n* 2000 = 2*x* + side of octagon\n**5. Solve for the Side of the Octagon**\nWe know (side of octagon)\u00b2 = 2*x\u00b2 \nSolve the equation from step 4 for *x*:\n* *x* = (2000 - side of octagon) / 2\nSubstitute this value of *x* into the equation (side of octagon)\u00b2 = 2*x\u00b2:\n* (side of octagon)\u00b2 = 2 * [(2000 - side of octagon) / 2]\u00b2 \n* (side of octagon)\u00b2 = (2000 - side of octagon)\u00b2 / 2\nNow, solve for the side of the octagon:\n* 2*(side of octagon)\u00b2 = (2000 - side of octagon)\u00b2\n* 2*(side of octagon)\u00b2 = 4000000 - 4000*(side of octagon) + (side of octagon)\u00b2\n* (side of octagon)\u00b2 + 4000*(side of octagon) - 4000000 = 0\nThis is a quadratic equation.  We can solve it using the quadratic formula:\n* side of octagon = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / 2a \nWhere a = 1, b = 4000, and c = -4000000\n* side of octagon = (-4000 \u00b1 \u221a(4000\u00b2 - 4 * 1 * -4000000)) / 2 * 1\n* side of octagon = (-4000 \u00b1 \u221a(32000000)) / 2\n* side of octagon = (-4000 \u00b1 4000\u221a2) / 2\n* side of octagon = -2000 \u00b1 2000\u221a2\nSince the side length cannot be negative, the answer is:\n* **side of octagon = 2000\u221a2 - 2000** \n",

The remaining shape is a regular octagon.\n**2. Focus on One Corner**\nConsider one corner of the square.  Let's call the length of the leg of the isosceles right triangle that gets cut off \"x\".\n**3. Apply the Pythagorean Theorem**\nSince the triangle is a 45-45-90 triangle, the hypotenuse (which is also a side of the square) is  x\u221a2.  We know the hypotenuse is 2000, so:\nx\u221a2 = 2000\n**4. Solve for x**\nDivide both sides by \u221a2:\nx = 2000/\u221a2 \nRationalize the denominator by multiplying the top and bottom by \u221a2:\nx = (2000\u221a2) / 2 = 1000\u221a2\n**5. Determine the Side Length of the Octagon**\nThe side of the octagon is made up of two segments: \n*  The leg of the right triangle (x = 1000\u221a2)\n*  The difference between the side of the square (2000) and the hypotenuse of the right triangle (x\u221a2 = 2000).\nTherefore, the side length of the octagon is:\n1000\u221a2 + (2000 - 2000) = **1000\u221a2** \n**Answer:** The length of each side of the octagon is **1000\u221a2**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Problem**\nImagine a square.  Cut off a small isosceles right triangle from each corner. The remaining shape will be a regular octagon. \n**2.  Focus on a Single Triangle**\nLet's focus on one of the triangles that is cut off.  Since it's an isosceles right triangle, the two legs are equal in length.  Let's call the length of each leg 'x'.\n**3.  Relate the Triangle to the Square**\nThe hypotenuse of this triangle is also a side of the square, which has length 2000.  We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find 'x':\n*  x\u00b2 + x\u00b2 = 2000\u00b2\n*  2x\u00b2 = 4,000,000\n*  x\u00b2 = 2,000,000\n*  x = \u221a2,000,000 = 1000\u221a2\n**4.  Find the Side Length of the Octagon**\n* The side length of the octagon is equal to the side length of the square minus twice the length of one leg of the triangle.\n*  Side of Octagon = 2000 - 2(1000\u221a2) = 2000 - 2000\u221a2 \n**5.  Simplify**\nWe can factor out a 2000:\n* Side of Octagon = 2000(1 - \u221a2)\n**Answer:** The length of each side of the octagon is **2000(1 - \u221a2)**. \n",

The isosceles right triangle we cut off has its hypotenuse along a side of the square. Since the square's side is 2000, the hypotenuse of the triangle is 2000.\n**3.  Find the Legs of the Triangle**\nIn an isosceles right triangle, the legs are equal.  Let's call the length of each leg *x*.  We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find *x*:\n* x\u00b2 + x\u00b2 = 2000\u00b2\n* 2x\u00b2 = 4,000,000\n* x\u00b2 = 2,000,000\n* x = \u221a2,000,000 = 1000\u221a2 \n**4.  Find the Side of the Octagon**\nThe side of the octagon is formed by the base of the triangle (which is *x*) plus the portion of the square's side that remains after cutting off the triangle. This remaining portion is 2000 - *x*.\n* Side of Octagon = *x* + (2000 - *x*) \n* Side of Octagon = 2000 - *x*\n* Side of Octagon = 2000 - 1000\u221a2\n**Answer:**  The length of each side of the octagon is **2000 - 1000\u221a2**. \n"
