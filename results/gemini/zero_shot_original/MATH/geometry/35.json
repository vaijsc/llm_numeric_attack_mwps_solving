    "solution": "The volume is the pyramid is $\\frac{1}{3}s^2h$, where $s$ is the side length of the base and $h$ is the height of the pyramid.  Therefore, the area of the base is $s^2=(63,\\!960\\text{ m}^3)/\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\cdot 30\\text{ m}\\right)=6396$ square meters.  Calling the center of the base $D$, we apply the Pythagorean theorem to triangle $ABD$ to get \\[AB=\\sqrt{h^2+(s/2)^2}=\\sqrt{h^2+s^2/4}=\\sqrt{30^2+6396/4}=\\sqrt{2499},\\] which is closer to $\\sqrt{2500}=\\boxed{50}$ meters than to $\\sqrt{2401}=49$ meters, since $49.5^2=2450.25$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Find the area of the square base:**\n* The volume of a pyramid is given by (1/3) * (area of base) * height. \n* We know the volume (63,960 cubic meters) and the height (30 meters).  \n* Let 's' represent the side length of the square base.  \n* So, 63,960 = (1/3) * (s\u00b2) * 30\n* Simplifying, 63,960 = 10s\u00b2\n* Dividing both sides by 10, 6396 = s\u00b2\n* Taking the square root of both sides, s = 79.975 meters (approximately).\n**2. Find the slant height:**\n* The lateral height (AB) is the height of one of the triangular faces of the pyramid. \n* Imagine drawing a line from the center of the square base to the midpoint of one of the sides of the square base. This forms a right triangle where:\n    * The base is half the side length of the square (79.975 / 2 = 39.9875 meters).\n    * The height is the height of the pyramid (30 meters).\n    * The hypotenuse is the lateral height (AB).\n* We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the lateral height:\n    * AB\u00b2 = 30\u00b2 + 39.9875\u00b2\n    * AB\u00b2 = 900 + 1599.5\n    * AB\u00b2 = 2499.5\n    * AB = \u221a2499.5 \u2248 50 meters (to the nearest whole number).\n**Therefore, the length of the lateral height (AB) is approximately 50 meters.** \n",
