        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Shapes**\nImagine the two squares and the circle.  The circle's diameter is equal to the side length of each square.\n**2. Find the Area of One Square**\n* Since the circle's diameter is equal to the side length of a square, the radius of the circle is half the side length of a square.\n* The area of one square is side length squared.\n**3. Find the Area of the Circle**\n* The area of a circle is  \u03c0 * (radius)^2.\n**4. Find the Area of the Overlap**\n* The overlap between the two squares is a smaller square.\n* The side length of this smaller square is the diameter of the circle (which is also the side length of the larger squares).\n* The area of the overlap is side length squared.\n**5. Calculate the Shaded Area**\n* The shaded area is the area of two squares minus the area of the circle minus the area of the overlap.\n**Calculations**\nLet's say the side length of each square is *s*.\n* **Area of one square:**  *s*\u00b2\n* **Area of the circle:** \u03c0 * ( *s* / 2 )\u00b2 = \u03c0 * *s*\u00b2 / 4\n* **Area of the overlap:** *s*\u00b2\n**Shaded Area:** \n2 * (*s*\u00b2) - (\u03c0 * *s*\u00b2 / 4) - *s*\u00b2 =  *s*\u00b2 - (\u03c0 * *s*\u00b2 / 4) =  *s*\u00b2 * (1 - \u03c0/4)\n**Simplifying**\nSince the side length of the square is irrelevant to the ratio of the areas, we can let *s* = 1.  Therefore, the shaded area is  **1 - \u03c0/4**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Problem**\nImagine two squares overlapping.  The circle's diameter is the line segment connecting the two points where the squares intersect.  The shaded region is the area of the two squares minus the area of the circle.\n**2. Find the Side Length of the Squares**\n*  The diameter of the circle is the diagonal of a smaller square formed by the intersection of the two larger squares.\n*  Since the squares are bisected, this smaller square has half the side length of the larger squares.\n*  Let the side length of the larger squares be *s*.  Then the diagonal of the smaller square is *s\u221a2*.\n*  This diagonal is also the diameter of the circle, so *s\u221a2* = diameter.\n**3. Find the Area of the Squares**\n* The area of each square is *s\u00b2*.\n* The total area of both squares is 2*s\u00b2.\n**4. Find the Area of the Circle**\n* The radius of the circle is half the diameter, so radius = (s\u221a2)/2.\n* The area of the circle is \u03c0 * radius\u00b2 = \u03c0 * (s\u221a2/2)\u00b2 = \u03c0s\u00b2/2.\n**5. Calculate the Area of the Shaded Region**\n*  The area of the shaded region is the area of the squares minus the area of the circle:\n   2*s\u00b2 - \u03c0s\u00b2/2 = s\u00b2(2 - \u03c0/2)\n**6. Express the Answer in Terms of the Circle's Diameter**\n*  We know *s\u221a2* is the diameter of the circle. Let's call the diameter *d*.\n*  Then, *s = d/\u221a2*.\n*  Substitute this into the area of the shaded region: (d/\u221a2)\u00b2(2 - \u03c0/2) = **d\u00b2(2 - \u03c0/2)/2**\n**Therefore, the area of the shaded region is d\u00b2(2 - \u03c0/2)/2, where *d* is the diameter of the circle.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the area of the squares:**\n* Each square has a side length of 4, so the area of one square is 4 * 4 = 16.\n* Since there are two squares, their combined area is 16 * 2 = 32.\n**2. Find the area of the circle:**\n* The diameter of the circle is equal to the side length of the squares (4).\n* The radius of the circle is half the diameter, or 4/2 = 2.\n* The area of the circle is \u03c0 * radius\u00b2 = \u03c0 * 2\u00b2 = 4\u03c0.\n**3. Find the area of the shaded region:**\n* The shaded region is the area of the squares minus the area of the circle.\n* Shaded area = 32 - 4\u03c0.\n**Therefore, the area of the shaded region is 32 - 4\u03c0.** \n",
