        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Understand the Relationship**\n* **Pyramid:** The pyramid *ABCH* has a rectangular base *ABCH* and its apex is at point *E*.\n* **Prism:** The rectangular prism *ABCDEFGH* has the same rectangular base *ABCD* as the pyramid.  The height of the prism is the distance between the base and the top face *EFGH*.\n**2. Key Observation**\nThe height of the pyramid *ABCH* is the same as the height of the prism *ABCDEFGH*.  This is because both heights are the distance between the base and the top face *EFGH*.\n**3. Volume Formulas**\n* **Pyramid:** Volume = (1/3) * (Area of base) * (Height)\n* **Prism:** Volume = (Area of base) * (Height)\n**4.  Solve for the Prism's Volume**\nSince the pyramid's volume is 20, we can write:\n* 20 = (1/3) * (Area of ABCD) * (Height)\nTo find the prism's volume, we multiply this equation by 3:\n* 60 = (Area of ABCD) * (Height)\nThis is exactly the formula for the volume of the prism!\n**Answer:** The volume of prism *ABCDEFGH* is **60**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Understand the Relationship Between the Pyramid and Prism**\n* **Pyramid ABCH:**  This pyramid has base *ABCH* which is a rectangle, and its apex is point *E*.\n* **Prism ABCDEFGH:** This prism is composed of six rectangular faces, and its base is the same rectangle *ABCH* as the pyramid.\n**2. Volume Formulas**\n* **Pyramid:**  Volume = (1/3) * (area of base) * (height)\n* **Prism:** Volume = (area of base) * (height)\n**3. Using the Given Information**\n* We know the volume of pyramid *ABCH* is 20. Let's call the area of rectangle *ABCH*  \"b\" and the height of the pyramid (which is the height of the prism) \"h\".  We can write:\n   * 20 = (1/3) * b * h\n**4. Finding the Volume of the Prism**\n* The volume of the prism is:\n   * Volume = b * h\n*  We can rewrite this using the equation from the pyramid:\n    * Volume = 3 * (1/3) * b * h \n    * Volume = 3 * 20 \n    * **Volume = 60**\n**Therefore, the volume of the prism ABCDEFGH is 60.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Understand the Shapes**\n* **Right Rectangular Prism:** A box-like shape with six rectangular faces.\n* **Pyramid:** A shape with a polygonal base and triangular faces that meet at a point (apex).\n**2.  Key Relationship**\nThe volume of a pyramid is one-third the volume of the prism with the same base and height.\n**3. Applying the Relationship**\n* The pyramid *ABCH* shares the same base (rectangle *ABCH*) and height (the distance between plane *ABCH* and point *E*) as the prism *ABCDEFGH*.\n* We know the volume of the pyramid is 20.\n* Therefore, the volume of the prism is 3 times the volume of the pyramid, or 3 * 20 = **60**.\n**Answer:** The volume of the prism *ABCDEFGH* is **60**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step by step:\n**1.

Use the volume formula for a pyramid:**\n* The volume of a pyramid is given by: (1/3) * (area of base) * (height)\n**3. Relate the pyramid's volume to the prism's volume:**\n* The prism's volume is given by: (area of base) * (height)\n* Notice that the volume of the prism is *three times* the volume of the pyramid because the formula for the prism's volume has a factor of 1 instead of 1/3.\n**4. Solve for the prism's volume:**\n* Since the pyramid's volume is 20, the prism's volume is 3 * 20 = **60**. \n**Therefore, the volume of rectangular prism *ABCDEFGH* is 60.** \n",
