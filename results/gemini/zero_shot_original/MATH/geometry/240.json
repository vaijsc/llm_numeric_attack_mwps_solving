    "problem": "What is the total surface area, in square inches, of a cube with a volume of $1$ cubic foot?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Recall that  $$1 \\mbox{ foot} = 12 \\mbox{ inches}$$\n\nHence $$1 \\mbox{ foot}^2 = 12^2 \\mbox{ inches}^2 = 144 \\mbox{ inches}^2$$\n\nFinally, remember the formula $V = l \\times w \\times h$, that is, Volume is the product of length, width, and height.\n\nThe length, height, and width for a cube are equal, so the cube we are given has sides of length $1 \\mbox{ feet}$. Now, a cube has 6 faces, so the surface area of our cube is $$6 \\times (1 \\mbox{ foot} \\times 1 \\mbox{ foot}) = 6 \\mbox{ feet}^2$$\n\nNow, convert: $$ 6 \\mbox{ feet}^2 \\frac{144 \\mbox{ inches}^2}{1 \\mbox{ foot}^2} = 864 \\mbox{ inches}^2$$\n\nSo, our final answer is $\\boxed{864 \\mbox{ inches}^2}$",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the relationship between volume and side length of a cube:**\n* The volume of a cube is found by cubing the side length:  Volume = side\u00b3\n* We know the volume is 1 cubic foot. \n**2. Find the side length of the cube:**\n* Let 's' represent the side length of the cube. \n*  s\u00b3 = 1 cubic foot\n* To find 's', take the cube root of both sides:  s = \u00b3\u221a1 = 1 foot\n**3. Convert the side length to inches:**\n* Since 1 foot = 12 inches, the side length of the cube is 12 inches.\n**4. Calculate the surface area of the cube:**\n* A cube has 6 equal square faces.\n* The area of one face is side\u00b2 = 12\u00b2 = 144 square inches.\n* The total surface area is 6 * 144 square inches = **864 square inches**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Convert Cubic Feet to Cubic Inches**\n* There are 12 inches in a foot, so there are 12 * 12 * 12 = 1728 cubic inches in a cubic foot.\n**2. Find the Side Length of the Cube**\n* The volume of a cube is found by  side * side * side (s\u00b3)\n* Since the volume is 1728 cubic inches, we need to find the cube root of 1728:  \u221b1728 = 12 inches. \n* Therefore, each side of the cube is 12 inches long.\n**3. Calculate the Surface Area**\n* A cube has 6 equal square faces.\n* The area of one face is side * side = 12 * 12 = 144 square inches.\n* The total surface area is 6 * 144 = **864 square inches**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Convert Cubic Feet to Cubic Inches:**\n* There are 12 inches in a foot, so a cubic foot is 12 inches x 12 inches x 12 inches = 1728 cubic inches.\n**2. Find the Side Length of the Cube:**\n* Since the volume of a cube is side length cubed (s\u00b3), we need to find the cube root of 1728 cubic inches: \u221b1728 = 12 inches.\n**3. Calculate the Surface Area:**\n* A cube has 6 equal square faces. \n* The area of one face is side length squared (s\u00b2): 12 inches x 12 inches = 144 square inches.\n* The total surface area is 6 times the area of one face: 6 x 144 square inches = 864 square inches.\n**Therefore, the total surface area of the cube is 864 square inches.** \n",
