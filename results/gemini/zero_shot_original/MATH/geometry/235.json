        "Here's how to compute $\\cos 30^\\circ$:\n**1.  Visualize the Unit Circle**\nImagine a circle with radius 1 centered at the origin of a coordinate plane.  An angle of $30^\\circ$ is formed by rotating a line segment counterclockwise from the positive x-axis.\n**2.  Equilateral Triangle**\nDraw an equilateral triangle inside the unit circle with one vertex at the origin and one side along the positive x-axis.  Each angle in an equilateral triangle is $60^\\circ$, so the angle formed by the radius to the top vertex of the triangle and the x-axis is $30^\\circ$.\n**3.  Coordinates**\n* The point where the triangle intersects the circle will have coordinates $(\\cos 30^\\circ, \\sin 30^\\circ)$.  \n* Since the triangle is equilateral, the height bisects the base.  This means the x-coordinate of the point is half the length of the base of the equilateral triangle. \n**4. Finding the Base**\n* The base of the equilateral triangle is the diameter of the unit circle, which is 2.\n* So, the x-coordinate of the point is $2/2 = 1$.\n**5.  Therefore**\nSince the x-coordinate of the point is $\\cos 30^\\circ$ and we found it to be 1, we have:\n$\\cos 30^\\circ = \\boxed{1}$. \n",
        "Here's how to compute $\\cos 30^\\circ$:\n**1. Visualize the 30-60-90 Triangle**\n* Draw an equilateral triangle (all sides equal).\n* Draw an altitude from one vertex to the opposite side. This altitude divides the equilateral triangle into two congruent 30-60-90 right triangles.\n**2. Understand the Side Ratios**\n* In a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in a specific ratio: \n    * The hypotenuse is twice the length of the shorter leg.\n    * The longer leg is $\\sqrt{3}$ times the length of the shorter leg.\n**3. Assign Values (for Simplicity)**\n* Let the shorter leg have length 1.\n* Then, the hypotenuse has length 2.\n* The longer leg has length $\\sqrt{3}$.\n**4. Apply the Cosine Definition**\n* Cosine is defined as the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse.\n* In our 30-60-90 triangle:\n    * Adjacent side to the 30-degree angle = $\\sqrt{3}$\n    * Hypotenuse = 2\n**5. Calculate**\n* $\\cos 30^\\circ = \\frac{\\text{adjacent}}{\\text{hypotenuse}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$\n**Therefore, $\\cos 30^\\circ = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.** \n",
        "Here's how to compute  $\\cos 30^\\circ$:\n**1. The Unit Circle:**\n* Recall that the cosine of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse.\n* We can use the unit circle to visualize this. The unit circle is a circle with radius 1, centered at the origin.\n* Any point on the unit circle can be represented by its coordinates  $(\\cos \\theta, \\sin \\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the angle formed by the positive x-axis and the line connecting the origin to the point.\n**2. Finding the 30-60-90 Triangle:**\n* Draw a 30-60-90 right triangle inside the unit circle.  The hypotenuse of this triangle is the radius of the unit circle, which is 1.\n* The ratio of the sides in a 30-60-90 triangle is  1:\u221a3:2.\n*  Since the hypotenuse is 1, the side opposite the 30\u00b0 angle is 1/2, and the side opposite the 60\u00b0 angle is \u221a3/2.\n**3.  Finding the Cosine:**\n* The cosine of 30\u00b0 is the x-coordinate of the point on the unit circle corresponding to 30\u00b0. \n* Looking at our 30-60-90 triangle, the x-coordinate of this point is the adjacent side (\u221a3/2) divided by the hypotenuse (1).\n**Therefore,  cos 30\u00b0 = \u221a3/2.** \n",
        "Here's how to compute $\\cos 30^\\circ$:\n**1.  Understanding the Unit Circle**\n* The cosine of an angle in a unit circle (a circle with radius 1) represents the x-coordinate of the point where the angle intersects the circle.\n**2.  30-60-90 Triangle**\n* A 30-60-90 triangle is a special right triangle with angles measuring 30 degrees, 60 degrees, and 90 degrees. The sides of this triangle have a specific ratio: \n    * The hypotenuse is twice the length of the shorter leg.\n    * The longer leg is the square root of 3 times the length of the shorter leg.\n**3.  Constructing the Triangle**\n* Imagine a 30-60-90 triangle inscribed in the unit circle.\n* The hypotenuse of this triangle is the radius of the circle (which is 1).\n* Since the hypotenuse is twice the length of the shorter leg, the shorter leg has a length of 1/2.\n* The longer leg has a length of \u221a3 / 2.\n**4.  Finding the Cosine**\n* The x-coordinate of the point where the 30-degree angle intersects the unit circle corresponds to the length of the longer leg of the triangle.\n* Therefore, $\\cos 30^\\circ = \\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}}$. \n",

Visualize the Unit Circle:**\n* Imagine a circle with radius 1 centered at the origin of a coordinate plane.\n* A 30\u00b0 angle in standard position starts at the positive x-axis and rotates counterclockwise.\n**2.  Identify the Relevant Triangle:**\n* Draw a line segment from the origin to the point where the 30\u00b0 angle intersects the unit circle.\n* This line segment forms the hypotenuse of a 30-60-90 right triangle.\n**3.  Recall the Properties of a 30-60-90 Triangle:**\n* The sides of a 30-60-90 triangle are in the ratio 1 : \u221a3 : 2.\n* Since the hypotenuse of our triangle is 1 (the radius of the unit circle), the shorter leg (adjacent to the 30\u00b0 angle) is 1/2, and the longer leg (opposite the 30\u00b0 angle) is \u221a3/2.\n**4.
