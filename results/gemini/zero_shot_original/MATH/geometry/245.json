    "solution": "First we know that surface area is 6 times the area of each face, or $6s^2$, and we set this equal to $\\frac{1}{6}$ of the volume. $$6s^2=\\frac{1}{6}s^3\\qquad\\Rightarrow 36s^2=s^3 \\qquad\\Rightarrow s=36$$Now we want a square of side length $a$ and area $a^2$ to have an area equal to the volume of the cube. $$a^2=s^3=36^3=(6^2)^3=6^6\\qquad\\Rightarrow a=\\sqrt{6^6}=6^3=216$$So the side length of the square should be $\\boxed{216}$.",

        "Here's how we can solve this problem step by step:\n**1. Set up the equations:**\n* **Surface Area of Cube:**  6s\u00b2 (since a cube has 6 faces)\n* **Volume of Cube:** s\u00b3\n* **Area of Square:**  x\u00b2 (where x is the side length of the square)\nWe are given that the surface area of the cube is 1/6 of its volume:\n* 6s\u00b2 = (1/6)s\u00b3\n**2. Solve for the side length of the cube (s):**\n* Divide both sides by s\u00b2: 6 = (1/6)s\n* Multiply both sides by 6: 36 = s\n**3. Find the volume of the cube:**\n* Volume = s\u00b3 = 36\u00b3 = 46656 cubic units\n**4. Find the side length of the square:**\n* We want the area of the square (x\u00b2) to equal the volume of the cube (46656):\n* x\u00b2 = 46656\n* Take the square root of both sides: x = \u221a46656 = 216\n**Therefore, the side length of the square should be 216 units.** \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Set up the equations based on the given information:**\n* **Surface Area of Cube:** The surface area of a cube is 6 times the area of one face, so the surface area is  6 * s\u00b2 \n* **Volume of Cube:** The volume of a cube is side length cubed, so the volume is s\u00b3.\n* **Relationship between Surface Area and Volume:**  We are told that the surface area is 1/6 of the volume: 6s\u00b2 = (1/6)s\u00b3\n**2. Solve for the side length of the cube (s):**\n*  Simplify the equation: 36s\u00b2 = s\u00b3\n*  Subtract 36s\u00b2 from both sides: 0 = s\u00b3 - 36s\u00b2\n*  Factor out s\u00b2: 0 = s\u00b2(s - 36)\n*  This gives us two possible solutions: s = 0 or s = 36. Since a cube cannot have a side length of 0, the side length of the cube is **s = 36 units**.\n**3. Calculate the volume of the cube:**\n* Volume of the cube = s\u00b3 = 36\u00b3 = 46,656 cubic units\n**4. Determine the side length of the square:**\n* We want the area of the square to equal the volume of the cube: side\u00b2 = 46,656\n* Take the square root of both sides: side = \u221a46,656 = **216 units**\n**Therefore, the side length of the square should be 216 units.** \n",
