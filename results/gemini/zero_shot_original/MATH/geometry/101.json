    "solution": "The triangle is a right triangle, since the $x$- and $y$-axes are perpendicular to each other. So the base of the triangle is $r$ units long and the height of the triangle is $8$ units. The area of the triangle is $\\frac12(r)(8)=4r$. We're told that the area is $40$, so $4r=40\\qquad$, which means  $r=\\boxed{10}$.",
