        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Situation**\nImagine a cube with a sphere perfectly nestled inside.  The sphere touches all six faces of the cube.\n**2.  Relate Sphere and Cube Dimensions**\n* **Diameter of the Sphere:** The diameter of the sphere is equal to the length of the side of the cube.\n* **Radius of the Sphere:** The radius of the sphere is half the diameter, so it's also half the side length of the cube.\n**3. Calculate the Cube's Side Length**\n* **Radius:** 3 inches\n* **Side Length:** 3 inches * 2 = 6 inches\n**4. Calculate the Cube's Volume**\n* **Side Length:** 6 inches\n* **Volume:** 6 inches * 6 inches * 6 inches = 216 cubic inches\n**Answer:** The cube has a volume of **216 cubic inches**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Problem**\nImagine a cube with a sphere perfectly nestled inside it, touching all six sides. The sphere's diameter will be equal to the cube's side length.\n**2.  Find the Diameter of the Sphere**\n* The radius of the sphere is 3 inches.\n* The diameter is twice the radius, so the diameter is 3 inches * 2 = 6 inches.\n**3. Determine the Cube's Side Length**\n* Since the sphere touches all sides of the cube, the cube's side length is equal to the sphere's diameter.\n* The cube's side length is 6 inches.\n**4. Calculate the Cube's Volume**\n* The volume of a cube is side length cubed (side * side * side).\n* The cube's volume is 6 inches * 6 inches * 6 inches = 216 cubic inches.\n**Therefore, there are 216 cubic inches in the volume of the cube.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Situation**\nImagine a cube with a sphere perfectly nestled inside it. The sphere touches the cube's faces at its center points.  \n**2. Connect the Dots**\nDraw a line from the center of the sphere to one of the corners of the cube. This line will pass through the center of one of the cube's faces.  \n**3. Form a Right Triangle**\nThe line you drew, the radius of the sphere, and half the length of a side of the cube form a right triangle.  The radius of the sphere is the hypotenuse of this triangle.\n**4. Apply the Pythagorean Theorem**\n* Let 's' be the side length of the cube.\n* Half the side length of the cube is s/2.\n* The radius of the sphere is 3 inches.\nUsing the Pythagorean Theorem:  (s/2)\u00b2 + (s/2)\u00b2 = 3\u00b2\n**5. Solve for 's'**\n*  s\u00b2/4 + s\u00b2/4 = 9\n*  s\u00b2/2 = 9\n*  s\u00b2 = 18\n*  s = \u221a18 = 3\u221a2 inches\n**6. Calculate the Cube's Volume**\n* Volume of a cube = side\u00b3\n* Volume = (3\u221a2)\u00b3 = 54 cubic inches\n**Therefore, the volume of the cube is 54 cubic inches.** \n",

Relate the Sphere's Diameter to the Cube's Side**\n* The sphere's diameter is equal to the side length of the cube. \n* Since the sphere's radius is 3 inches, its diameter is 6 inches.\n**3. Calculate the Cube's Volume**\n* The cube's side length is 6 inches.\n* Volume of a cube = side * side * side \n* Volume of the cube = 6 inches * 6 inches * 6 inches = 216 cubic inches\n**Answer:** The cube has a volume of **216 cubic inches**. \n",
