        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Geometry**\n* We have a large square pyramid.\n* A plane parallel to the base cuts off a smaller pyramid from the top. \n* The smaller pyramid is similar to the larger pyramid (all corresponding angles are equal, and sides are proportional).\n**2. Ratios of Similar Figures**\n* **Linear Ratio:**  The ratio of corresponding side lengths in similar figures is constant. Let's call this ratio  'k'. Since the plane is 2 units from the base, the smaller pyramid has side lengths that are 'k' times the side lengths of the larger pyramid.\n* **Area Ratio:** The ratio of the areas of similar figures is the square of the linear ratio. So, the ratio of the area of the smaller pyramid to the area of the larger pyramid is  k\u00b2.\n**3. Set up the Equation**\n* We are given that the surface area of the smaller pyramid is half the surface area of the original pyramid. This translates to:  k\u00b2 = 1/2\n**4. Solve for k**\n* Taking the square root of both sides, we get k = 1/\u221a2\n**5.  Relate 'k' to the Altitude**\n* The altitude of the smaller pyramid is 'k' times the altitude of the larger pyramid.  Let 'h' be the altitude of the larger pyramid. The altitude of the smaller pyramid is kh = (1/\u221a2)h.\n**6.  Use the Information About the Plane**\n* The difference in altitude between the two pyramids is 2 units.  This means: \n   h - (1/\u221a2)h = 2\n**7. Solve for 'h'**\n* Simplify the equation: (1 - 1/\u221a2)h = 2\n* Multiply both sides by (\u221a2 + 1)/(\u221a2 + 1) to get rid of the fraction: (\u221a2 - 1)h = 2(\u221a2 + 1)\n* Isolate 'h': h = (2\u221a2 + 2) / (\u221a2 - 1)\n* Rationalize the denominator: h = (2\u221a2 + 2)(\u221a2 + 1) / (\u221a2 - 1)(\u221a2 + 1) = (4 + 4\u221a2 + 2\u221a2 + 2) / (2 - 1) = 6 + 6\u221a2\n**Therefore, the altitude of the original pyramid is 6 + 6\u221a2 units.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Geometry**\n* **Original Pyramid:** A pyramid with a square base and an altitude (height) we'll call 'h'.\n* **Smaller Pyramid:** A pyramid cut off by a plane parallel to the base, 2 units below the original base. This smaller pyramid is similar to the original pyramid.\n**2.  Similar Figures and Ratios**\n* **Similar figures:**  The smaller pyramid is similar to the original pyramid. This means their corresponding sides are proportional.\n* **Ratio of Heights:** Since the smaller pyramid is 2 units below the original base, its height is (h-2). The ratio of their heights is (h-2)/h.\n* **Ratio of Sides:** Since the pyramids are similar, the ratio of their side lengths is also (h-2)/h.\n**3. Surface Area Relationship**\n* **Surface Area of a Pyramid:** The surface area of a pyramid is the sum of the areas of its base and four triangular faces.\n* **Ratio of Surface Areas:**  The problem states that the surface area of the smaller pyramid is half the surface area of the original pyramid. Since the area of a shape is proportional to the square of its side length, the ratio of their surface areas is the square of the ratio of their corresponding side lengths:  [(h-2)/h]^2 = 1/2\n**4. Solve the Equation**\n* **Simplify:** (h-2)^2 = (1/2)h^2\n* **Expand:** h^2 - 4h + 4 = (1/2)h^2\n* **Rearrange:** (1/2)h^2 - 4h + 4 = 0\n* **Multiply by 2:** h^2 - 8h + 8 = 0\n* **Solve using the quadratic formula:**  h = [8 \u00b1 \u221a(8^2 - 4 * 1 * 8)] / (2 * 1)\n* **Simplify:** h = (8 \u00b1 \u221a32) / 2 = 4 \u00b1 2\u221a2\n**5. Choose the Correct Solution**\n* We need a positive solution for the height of the pyramid, so we choose h = 4 + 2\u221a2.\n**Answer:** The altitude of the original pyramid is **4 + 2\u221a2** units. \n",

Key Ratios**\n* **Surface Area Ratio:**  The surface area of similar figures is proportional to the square of the corresponding side lengths. Since the smaller pyramid's surface area is half that of the original, the ratio of their side lengths is  \u221a(1/2) = 1/\u221a2.\n* **Height Ratio:** Since the pyramids are similar, the ratio of their heights is also 1/\u221a2.\n**3.  Set Up the Problem**\n* Let  'h' be the altitude of the original pyramid.\n* The altitude of the smaller pyramid is (h - 2) (since the plane is 2 units from the base).\n**4.  Use the Height Ratio**\n* We know the ratio of heights is 1/\u221a2: \n   (h - 2) / h = 1/\u221a2\n**5.  Solve for h**\n* Cross-multiply: \u221a2(h - 2) = h\n* Distribute: \u221a2h - 2\u221a2 = h\n* Isolate h: \u221a2h - h = 2\u221a2\n* Factor out h: h(\u221a2 - 1) = 2\u221a2\n* Solve for h: h = 2\u221a2 / (\u221a2 - 1) \n**6. Rationalize the Denominator**\n* Multiply numerator and denominator by (\u221a2 + 1):\n    h = (2\u221a2 * (\u221a2 + 1)) / ((\u221a2 - 1) * (\u221a2 + 1))\n    h = (4 + 2\u221a2) / 1\n    h = 4 + 2\u221a2\n**Therefore, the altitude of the original pyramid is 4 + 2\u221a2 units.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Geometry**\n* **Original Pyramid:**  Imagine a pyramid with a square base. Its apex (top point) is directly above the center of the square base.\n* **Cut:** A plane parallel to the base cuts the pyramid, creating a smaller pyramid at the top. This smaller pyramid is similar to the original pyramid.\n* **Similarity:**  Similar figures have proportional sides and surface areas. \n**2. Set Up Proportions**\n* **Side Lengths:** Let the side length of the base of the original pyramid be *s*. Since the smaller pyramid is 2 units from the base of the original, its side length is *s/2* (because the cut is parallel, it reduces all dimensions proportionally).\n* **Surface Areas:** The problem states the surface area of the smaller pyramid is half the surface area of the original. \n**3. Calculate Surface Area**\n* **Original Pyramid:** The surface area of a pyramid with a square base is the area of the base plus the areas of the four triangular faces. \n    * Base area:  *s\u00b2*\n    * Triangle area (each):  *(1/2) * s * l*  where *l* is the slant height of the pyramid.\n    * Total surface area: *s\u00b2 + 2sl*\n* **Smaller Pyramid:**  \n    * Base area: *(s/2)\u00b2 = s\u00b2/4*\n    * Triangle area (each): *(1/2) * (s/2) * (l/2) = sl/8* \n    * Total surface area: *s\u00b2/4 + sl/2*\n**4. Use the Given Information**\nWe know the surface area of the smaller pyramid is half that of the original:\n*  *(s\u00b2/4 + sl/2) = (1/2) * (s\u00b2 + 2sl)*\n**5. Simplify and Solve**\n*  *s\u00b2/4 + sl/2 = s\u00b2/2 + sl*\n*  *sl/2 = s\u00b2/4*\n*  *l = s/2*  (This tells us the slant height of the original pyramid is twice the side length of the smaller pyramid's base)\n**6. Find the Altitude**\n* We need to find the altitude (*h*) of the original pyramid.  \n* Consider a right triangle formed by half the base of the original pyramid, the altitude, and the slant height.\n* This is a right triangle with legs of *s/2* and *h*, and a hypotenuse of *l = s/2*. \n* Using the Pythagorean Theorem: *(s/2)\u00b2 = h\u00b2 + (s/2)\u00b2*\n*  *h\u00b2 = 0*\n*  *h = 0*\n**7. Interpretation**\nWe get an altitude of 0. This doesn't make sense for a pyramid.  The problem setup must be flawed. It's impossible for a pyramid to have a smaller version with half the surface area if the smaller version is created by a parallel cut. \n**Conclusion:** There's an error in the problem statement. It's impossible for the smaller pyramid to have half the surface area under the given conditions. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\n* We have a pyramid with a square base.\n* A plane parallel to the base cuts the pyramid, creating a smaller pyramid on top.\n* The smaller pyramid's surface area is half that of the original pyramid.\n* We need to find the altitude (height) of the original pyramid.\n**2. Setting Up Variables**\n* Let  's' be the side length of the square base of the original pyramid.\n* Let 'h' be the altitude of the original pyramid.\n* Let 'x' be the distance from the apex of the pyramid to the plane that cuts the pyramid.\n**3. Using Similar Triangles**\n* The smaller pyramid created by the plane is similar to the original pyramid.\n* Since the plane is 2 units from the base, the height of the smaller pyramid is (h - 2). \n* The ratio of corresponding sides in similar figures is constant. Therefore:\n    *  (h - 2) / h = (side length of smaller base) / s \n**4. Relating Surface Area to Side Length**\n* **Surface Area of a Pyramid:**  The surface area of a pyramid is the area of its base plus the area of its triangular faces. \n* **Original Pyramid:**\n    * Base area: s\u00b2\n    * Each triangular face: (1/2) * s * (slant height of original pyramid)\n* **Smaller Pyramid:**\n    * Base area: (side length of smaller base)\u00b2\n    * Each triangular face: (1/2) * (side length of smaller base) * (slant height of smaller pyramid)\n* **Surface Area Relationship:** The smaller pyramid's surface area is half that of the original pyramid. This means the ratio of their base areas is also 1:2.\n**5. Setting Up Equations**\n* From the similar triangles, we know:  (h - 2) / h = (side length of smaller base) / s \n* From the surface area relationship, we know: (side length of smaller base)\u00b2 / s\u00b2 = 1/2\n**6. Solving for the Altitude (h)**\n* **Simplify the surface area equation:** (side length of smaller base) / s = 1/\u221a2 \n* **Substitute into the similar triangles equation:** (h - 2) / h = 1/\u221a2\n* **Solve for h:**\n    * \u221a2 (h - 2) = h\n    * \u221a2h - 2\u221a2 = h\n    * (\u221a2 - 1) h = 2\u221a2\n    * h = 2\u221a2 / (\u221a2 - 1)\n    * **Rationalize the denominator:**  h = (2\u221a2 * (\u221a2 + 1)) / ((\u221a2 - 1)(\u221a2 + 1)) = (4 + 2\u221a2) / 1 = 4 + 2\u221a2\n**Therefore, the altitude of the original pyramid is 4 + 2\u221a2 units.** \n"
