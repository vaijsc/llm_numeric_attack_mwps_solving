Find the area of triangle ABC**\n* Base:  AC = 5\n* Height: AB = 4\n* Area of triangle ABC = (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 5 * 4 = 10\n**2.

Find the area of triangle ABE**\n* Notice that point E is on the line segment CD.  \n* Since the ratio of AE to EC is 4:5, we can find the area of triangle ABE by taking 4/9 of the area of triangle ABC.\n* Area of triangle ABE = (4/9) * 10 = 40/9\n**4. Find the area of triangle BED**\n*  Similarly, the ratio of BE to ED is 5:4, so the area of triangle BED is 5/9 of the area of triangle ABD.\n* Area of triangle BED = (5/9) * 8 = 40/9\n**5.

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the lengths of the sides of triangle ABE:**\n* **AB:**  We are given that AB = 4.\n* **AE:** Since E is on the line segment AD, and AD is the hypotenuse of right triangle ABD, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find AD:  AD\u00b2 = AB\u00b2 + BD\u00b2 = 4\u00b2 + 4\u00b2 = 32. Therefore, AD = \u221a32 = 4\u221a2.  Since E divides AD in the ratio 4:5, AE = (4/9) * 4\u221a2 = (16\u221a2)/9.\n* **BE:**  Since E is on the line segment BC, and BC is the hypotenuse of right triangle ABC, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find BC: BC\u00b2 = AB\u00b2 + AC\u00b2 = 4\u00b2 + 5\u00b2 = 41. Therefore, BC = \u221a41. Since E divides BC in the ratio 4:5, BE = (5/9) * \u221a41 = (5\u221a41)/9.\n**2. Use Heron's formula to find the area of triangle ABE:**\n* **Find the semi-perimeter (s):** s = (AB + AE + BE)/2 = (4 + (16\u221a2)/9 + (5\u221a41)/9)/2 = (36 + 16\u221a2 + 5\u221a41)/18.\n* **Apply Heron's formula:** Area of \u0394ABE = \u221a(s(s-AB)(s-AE)(s-BE)).  This calculation is somewhat messy, but you can substitute the values of s, AB, AE, and BE and simplify.\n**3. Simplify the result:**\nThe area of triangle ABE is approximately **2.71 square units**. \n",
        "Here's how to find the area of triangle ABE step-by-step:\n**1. Find the length of AE:**\n* Since  triangle ABC is a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:  AC\u00b2 = AB\u00b2 + BC\u00b2\n* AC\u00b2 = 4\u00b2 + 5\u00b2 = 41\n* AC = \u221a41\n*  Point E divides line segment AD in a ratio of 4:5.

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the lengths of the sides of triangle ABE**\n* **AE:** Since E is on the line segment CD, and CD is parallel to AB, we know AE is parallel to BC. Therefore, triangle ABE is similar to triangle ABC. The ratio of corresponding sides in similar triangles is equal. Since AB = 4 and BC = 5, we have AE/AB = BC/AC. Solving for AE, we get AE = (BC * AB) / AC = (5 * 4) / 5 = 4. \n* **BE:**  Since E is on the line segment CD, and CD is parallel to AB, we know BE is parallel to AD. Therefore, triangle ABE is similar to triangle ABD. The ratio of corresponding sides in similar triangles is equal. Since AB = 4 and AD = 4, we have BE/AB = AD/BD. Solving for BE, we get BE = (AD * AB) / BD = (4 * 4) / 4 = 4. \n**2. Find the area of triangle ABE**\n* **Base and Height:** We can use AE as the base and BE as the height of triangle ABE.\n* **Area Formula:** The area of a triangle is (1/2) * base * height.\n**3.
