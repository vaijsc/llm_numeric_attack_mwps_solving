    "solution": "Let $A,B,C,$ and $D$ be the corners of a regular tetrahedron of side length $1$. Let $P$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $D$ to face $ABC$, and let $h$ be the height $DP$: [asy]\nimport three;\ntriple a = (0,0,0);\ntriple b = (1,0,0);\ntriple c = (1/2,sqrt(3)/2,0);\ntriple d = (1/2,sqrt(3)/6,sqrt(6)/3);\ntriple p = (a+b+c)/3;\n\ndraw(surface(a--b--c--cycle),pink,nolight);\ndraw(b--c--d--b);\ndraw(c--a--b,dashed); draw(a--d--p--b,dashed);\ndraw(p+(d-p)*0.08--p+(d-p)*0.08+(b-p)*sqrt(2)*0.08--p+(b-p)*sqrt(2)*0.08);\ndot(a); dot(b); dot(c); dot(d); dot(p);\nlabel(\"$A$\",a,ENE);\nlabel(\"$B$\",b,WSW);\nlabel(\"$C$\",c,ESE);\nlabel(\"$D$\",d,N);\nlabel(\"$P$\",p,E);\nlabel(\"$h$\",0.45*d+0.55*p,W);\n[/asy] Then, by the Pythagorean theorem, we have $$h^2+(PA)^2 = h^2+(PB)^2 = h^2+(PC)^2 = 1,$$so $PA=PB=PC$. The only point on face $ABC$ that is equidistant from $A,B,$ and $C$ is the intersection of the altitudes. If $M$ is the midpoint of $AC$, then $\\triangle CPM$ is a $30^\\circ$-$60^\\circ$-$90^\\circ$ triangle with $CM=\\frac 12$, so $PC=\\frac 2{\\sqrt 3}\\cdot\\frac 12=\\frac 1{\\sqrt 3}$.\n\nTherefore, $$h=\\sqrt{1-(PC)^2} = \\sqrt{1-\\left(\\frac 1{\\sqrt 3}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{1-\\frac 13} = \\sqrt{\\frac 23} = \\frac{\\sqrt 2}{\\sqrt 3},$$and the volume of tetrahedron $ABCD$ is \\begin{align*}\nV &= \\frac 13\\cdot(\\text{area of }\\triangle ABC)\\cdot h \\\\\n&= \\frac 13\\cdot\\left(\\frac 12\\cdot 1\\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt 3}2\\right)\\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt 2}{\\sqrt 3} \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\sqrt 2}{12};\n\\end{align*}the square of the volume is $$V^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt 2}{12}\\right)^2 = \\frac{2}{144} = \\boxed{\\frac 1{72}}.$$",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Tetrahedron**\nImagine a regular tetrahedron. It has four identical equilateral triangular faces.\n**2. Find the Height**\n* **Draw an Altitude:** Draw an altitude from one vertex of the tetrahedron to the center of the opposite face. This altitude will be perpendicular to the base.\n* **Equilateral Triangle Properties:** The base of the tetrahedron is an equilateral triangle with side length 1.  The altitude of an equilateral triangle divides it into two 30-60-90 right triangles. \n* **30-60-90 Triangle Ratios:**  In a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1 : \u221a3 : 2.  Since the hypotenuse of the smaller right triangle in the base is 1/2, the height of the base triangle is (1/2)\u221a3.\n* **Finding the Height of the Tetrahedron:** Now consider the larger right triangle formed by the altitude of the tetrahedron, half a side of the base, and the height of the base triangle.  This is another 30-60-90 triangle. The hypotenuse is 1 (half the side of the tetrahedron), and the shorter leg is (1/2)\u221a3 (the height of the base triangle).  Therefore, the altitude (the height of the tetrahedron) is (1/2) * \u221a3 = \u221a3 / 2.\n**3. Calculate the Volume**\n* **Volume Formula:** The volume of a pyramid is (1/3) * (area of base) * (height).\n* **Base Area:** The area of an equilateral triangle with side length 1 is (\u221a3 / 4) * 1\u00b2 = \u221a3 / 4.\n* **Substitute:** The volume of the tetrahedron is (1/3) * (\u221a3 / 4) * (\u221a3 / 2) = \u221a3 / 8.\n**4. Find V\u00b2**\n* **Square the Volume:**  V\u00b2 = (\u221a3 / 8)\u00b2 = 3/64.\n**Therefore, the exact value of V\u00b2 is 3/64.** \n",
        "Here's how to find the volume of a regular tetrahedron with side length 1, and then square that volume:\n**1. Find the height of the tetrahedron:**\n* **Divide the tetrahedron into four smaller congruent pyramids:** Imagine drawing lines from each vertex of the tetrahedron to the center of the base.  This divides the tetrahedron into four smaller pyramids. Each of these pyramids has a base that is one of the equilateral triangle faces of the tetrahedron, and its apex is at the center of the base of the larger tetrahedron.\n* **Focus on one of the smaller pyramids:** Consider one of these smaller pyramids. The height of this smaller pyramid is the height of the larger tetrahedron. The base of the smaller pyramid is an equilateral triangle with side length 1.\n* **Find the area of the base:** The area of an equilateral triangle with side length $s$ is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}s^2$, so the area of the base of the smaller pyramid is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}$.\n* **Find the length of the median of the equilateral triangle:** The median of an equilateral triangle divides the triangle into two 30-60-90 triangles.  The hypotenuse of one of these triangles is the side length of the equilateral triangle (1), and the shorter leg is half the side length (1/2).  The longer leg (the median) is $\\sqrt{3}$ times the shorter leg, so the median has length $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\n* **Find the height of the smaller pyramid:** The height of the smaller pyramid is the length of the altitude from the apex to the center of the equilateral triangle.  This altitude is also the median of the equilateral triangle, so it has length $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\n**2. Calculate the volume of the larger tetrahedron:**\n* **Volume of a pyramid:** The volume of a pyramid is $\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\text{base area} \\cdot \\text{height}$.\n* **Volume of the smaller pyramid:**  The volume of one of the smaller pyramids is $\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} = \\frac{1}{8}$.\n* **Volume of the larger tetrahedron:** Since the tetrahedron is divided into four congruent smaller pyramids, the volume of the larger tetrahedron is $4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n**3. Square the volume:**\n* $V^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$ \n",
        "Here's how to find the volume of a regular tetrahedron with side length 1, and then square it:\n**1. Visualize the Tetrahedron**\nImagine a regular tetrahedron. It has four vertices (corners) and four faces, each an equilateral triangle.\n**2. Find the Height**\n* **Draw an Altitude:**  Draw a perpendicular line from one vertex (let's call it the top vertex) to the center of the opposite face (the base). This line is the height of the tetrahedron.\n* **Equilateral Triangle Geometry:** The base of the tetrahedron is an equilateral triangle.  The center of an equilateral triangle is also its centroid, which divides each median in a 2:1 ratio. \n* **Right Triangle:** The height, a side of the base, and a line segment from the center of the base to a midpoint of a side form a right triangle.  The hypotenuse of this triangle is a side of the equilateral triangle, and the shorter leg is one-third of the side of the equilateral triangle (because of the 2:1 ratio mentioned above). \n**3. Calculate the Height**\n* **Pythagorean Theorem:** Let the side of the equilateral triangle be *s*. The shorter leg of the right triangle is *s/3*, and the hypotenuse is *s*.  Using the Pythagorean Theorem:\n    * (height)^2 + (s/3)^2 = s^2\n    * (height)^2 = s^2 - (s/3)^2 = (8/9)s^2\n    * height = \u221a(8/9)s^2 = (2\u221a2/3)s\n* **Substitute s = 1:** Since the side length of our tetrahedron is 1, the height is (2\u221a2)/3.\n**4. Calculate the Volume**\n* **Volume Formula:** The volume of a pyramid is (1/3) * (base area) * (height).\n* **Base Area:** The base of the tetrahedron is an equilateral triangle with side length 1. The area of an equilateral triangle is (\u221a3/4) * s^2. So, the base area is (\u221a3/4).\n* **Substitute:** The volume of the tetrahedron is (1/3) * (\u221a3/4) * (2\u221a2/3) = (\u221a6)/18.\n**5. Square the Volume**\n* **V^2:** ((\u221a6)/18)^2 = 6/324 = **1/54**\n**Therefore, the exact value of V^2 is 1/54.** \n",

The apex (top point) of the tetrahedron is directly above the center of the equilateral triangle base. \n* **Equilateral Triangle Properties:** An equilateral triangle with side length 1 has a height of $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\n* **Right Triangle:**  Draw a line from the apex to the center of the base.  This line, along with a side of the triangle and a line from the center of the base to a vertex, forms a right triangle. The hypotenuse of this right triangle is a side of the tetrahedron (length 1), and the shorter leg is half the height of the equilateral triangle base (length $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}$).\n* **Pythagorean Theorem:** Use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the height of the tetrahedron: \n   $h^2 = 1^2 - \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\right)^2 = 1 - \\frac{3}{16} = \\frac{13}{16}$\n   $h = \\sqrt{\\frac{13}{16}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{13}}{4}$\n**2.
