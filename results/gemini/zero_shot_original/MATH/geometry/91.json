Visualize the Unit Circle:**\n* Imagine a circle with radius 1 centered at the origin of a coordinate plane.\n* An angle of 60\u00b0 is formed by rotating a line counterclockwise from the positive x-axis.\n**2. Find the Point on the Circle:**\n* The point where the rotated line intersects the unit circle has coordinates (1/2, \u221a3/2).  This is because a 30-60-90 right triangle is formed, with the hypotenuse being 1 (the radius of the circle).\n**3. Recall the Definition of Cosine:**\n* The cosine of an angle is the x-coordinate of the point where the angle's terminal side intersects the unit circle.\n**4.
