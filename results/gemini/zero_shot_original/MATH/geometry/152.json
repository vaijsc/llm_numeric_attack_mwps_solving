        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Problem:**\n* We have a pentagon (a five-sided polygon).\n* The angles of the pentagon are represented by the variables *v*, *w*, *x*, *y*, and *z*.\n* These angles are in an arithmetic sequence, meaning the difference between consecutive terms is constant.\n* We need to find the value of *x*.\n**2. Use the Angle Sum Property of a Pentagon:**\n* The sum of the interior angles of any polygon is given by (n-2) * 180 degrees, where n is the number of sides. \n* For a pentagon, the sum of the angles is (5-2) * 180 = 540 degrees.\n* So, we have the equation:  *v* + *w* + *x* + *y* + *z* = 540\n**3. Apply the Arithmetic Sequence Property:**\n* Since the angles form an arithmetic sequence, let the common difference be *d*.  We can write:\n    * *w* = *v* + *d*\n    * *x* = *v* + 2*d*\n    * *y* = *v* + 3*d*\n    * *z* = *v* + 4*d*\n**4. Substitute into the Angle Sum Equation:**\n* Substitute the expressions for *w*, *x*, *y*, and *z* into the angle sum equation:\n    * *v* + (*v* + *d*) + (*v* + 2*d*) + (*v* + 3*d*) + (*v* + 4*d*) = 540\n**5. Simplify and Solve for *v*:**\n* Combine like terms: 5*v* + 10*d* = 540\n* Divide both sides by 5:  *v* + 2*d* = 108\n**6. Solve for *x*:**\n* Remember that *x* = *v* + 2*d*.  \n* Since we know *v* + 2*d* = 108, we have:\n    * *x* = 108\n**Therefore, the value of *x* is 108 degrees.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Properties**\n* **Pentagon:** A pentagon has five sides and five angles.\n* **Sum of Interior Angles:** The sum of the interior angles of any polygon with *n* sides is given by (n-2) * 180 degrees. For a pentagon, this means the sum of the angles is (5-2) * 180 = 540 degrees.\n* **Arithmetic Sequence:**  An arithmetic sequence is a list of numbers where the difference between any two consecutive terms is constant. This constant difference is called the common difference.\n**2. Set up Equations**\nLet *d* be the common difference of the arithmetic sequence.  Since the angles are in increasing order, we have:\n*  v = first term\n*  w = v + d\n*  x = v + 2d\n*  y = v + 3d\n*  z = v + 4d\nThe sum of the angles is 540 degrees, so:\nv + (v + d) + (v + 2d) + (v + 3d) + (v + 4d) = 540\n**3. Solve for the Common Difference**\nSimplify the equation:\n5v + 10d = 540\nDivide both sides by 5:\nv + 2d = 108\n**4. Solve for x**\nWe know x = v + 2d.  From the equation above, we know v + 2d = 108.  Therefore:\nx = **108** \n**Answer:** The value of x is 108 degrees. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n* We have a pentagon, a five-sided polygon.\n* The angles of the pentagon are represented by variables:  *v*, *w*, *x*, *y*, and *z*.\n* The angles are in ascending order: *v* < *w* < *x* < *y* < *z*.\n* The angles form an arithmetic sequence, meaning there's a constant difference between each consecutive angle.\n**2. Use the Angle Sum Property**\nThe sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is (5 - 2) * 180\u00b0 = 540\u00b0.  This means:\n*v + w + x + y + z = 540\u00b0*\n**3. Apply Arithmetic Sequence Properties**\nSince the angles form an arithmetic sequence, we can express them in terms of the first angle (*v*) and the common difference (*d*):\n* w = v + d\n* x = v + 2d\n* y = v + 3d\n* z = v + 4d\n**4. Substitute and Solve**\nSubstitute these expressions into the angle sum equation:\n* v + (v + d) + (v + 2d) + (v + 3d) + (v + 4d) = 540\u00b0\nSimplify the equation:\n* 5v + 10d = 540\u00b0\n**5. Find the Common Difference (d)**\nSince the angles form an arithmetic sequence, we know that the difference between consecutive angles is constant. We can use the fact that *x* is the third angle to find *d*:\n* x = v + 2d\nSince *x* is the middle angle in the sequence, it's the average of the first and fifth angles:\n* x = (v + z) / 2\nSubstituting *z = v + 4d* into this equation:\n* x = (v + v + 4d) / 2\n* x = (2v + 4d) / 2\n* x = v + 2d\n**6. Solve for x**\nWe now have two expressions for *x*:\n* x = v + 2d\n* x = (540\u00b0 - 10d) / 5 \nSetting these equal to each other:\n* v + 2d = (540\u00b0 - 10d) / 5\nMultiply both sides by 5:\n* 5v + 10d = 540\u00b0 - 10d\nSimplify:\n* 5v + 20d = 540\u00b0\nNow we can solve for *d*:\n* 20d = 540\u00b0 - 5v\n* d = (540\u00b0 - 5v) / 20\n**7.  Express x in terms of v**\nSubstitute the value of *d* back into the equation *x = v + 2d*:\n* x = v + 2[(540\u00b0 - 5v) / 20]\n* x = v + (540\u00b0 - 5v) / 10\n* x = (10v + 540\u00b0 - 5v) / 10\n* x = (540\u00b0 + 5v) / 10\n* x = 54\u00b0 + 0.5v\n**8. Conclusion**\nThe value of *x* is **54\u00b0 + 0.5v**.  Since we don't know the exact value of *v*, we can't find a numerical answer for *x*. However, we have successfully expressed *x* in terms of *v*. \n",
