    "solution": "We draw a regular hexagon $ABCDEF$ as shown below.  The desired distance can be measured by diagonal $AC$: [asy]\n\nsize(120);\npair A,B,C,D,E,F;\nA = dir(0); B = dir(60); C = dir(120); D = dir(180); E = dir(240); F = dir(300);\n\ndraw(E--C);\n\nlabel(\"$6$\",(A+B)/2,NE);\nlabel(\"$A$\",C,NW);label(\"$B$\",D,W);label(\"$C$\",E,SW);label(\"$D$\",F,SE);label(\"$E$\",A,ENE);label(\"$F$\",B,NE);\ndraw(A--B--C--D--E--F--A);\n[/asy] To compute the length of $AC$, we let $H$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $B$ to $AC$: [asy]\n\nsize(120);\npair A,B,C,D,E,F;\nA = dir(0); B = dir(60); C = dir(120); D = dir(180); E = dir(240); F = dir(300);\n\ndraw(E--C);\n\nlabel(\"$6$\",(A+B)/2,NE);\nlabel(\"$A$\",C,NW);label(\"$B$\",D,W);label(\"$C$\",E,SW);label(\"$D$\",F,SE);label(\"$E$\",A,ENE);label(\"$F$\",B,NE);\ndraw(A--B--C--D--E--F--A); pair H=(E+C)/2; draw(D--H); label(\"$H$\",H,ENE);\n[/asy] Since the hexagon is regular, $\\angle ABC = 120^\\circ$ and $\\angle ABH = \\angle CBH = 120^\\circ / 2 = 60^\\circ$.  Thus, $\\triangle ABH$ and $\\triangle CBH$ are congruent $30^\\circ - 60^\\circ - 90^\\circ$ triangles.  These triangles are each half an equilateral triangle, so their short leg is half as long as their hypotenuse.\n\nSince $AB=BC=6$, we have $BH = AB/2 = 3$ and $AH = CH = \\sqrt{6^2-3^2} = \\sqrt{27} = 3\\sqrt{3}$.  (Notice that this value is $\\sqrt{3}$ times the length of $BH$, the short leg.  In general, the ratio of the sides in a $30^\\circ - 60^\\circ - 90^\\circ$ triangle is $1:\\sqrt{3}:2$, which can be shown by the Pythagorean Theorem.)  Then, $AC = 2\\cdot 3\\sqrt{3} = 6\\sqrt{3}$.  Thus, any pair of parallel sides in this regular hexagon are $\\boxed{6\\sqrt{3}}$ units apart.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Visualize the Hexagon:**\nImagine a regular hexagon.  It has six equal sides and six equal angles.\n**2. Divide the Hexagon:**\nDraw a line segment connecting two opposite vertices of the hexagon. This divides the hexagon into two congruent trapezoids.\n**3. Focus on One Trapezoid:**\nLet's focus on one of these trapezoids.  The two parallel sides of the trapezoid are:\n*  One side is a side of the hexagon, which has a length of 6 units.\n*  The other side is the line segment we drew, which is a diagonal of the hexagon.\n**4. Find the Diagonal's Length:**\nTo find the length of the diagonal, we can use the fact that each angle of a regular hexagon measures 120 degrees.  Divide the hexagon into six equilateral triangles by drawing lines from the center to each vertex.  \n* Each equilateral triangle has side length 6 units.\n* The diagonal of the hexagon is the base of two of these equilateral triangles. \n* Use the Law of Cosines on one of these triangles:  \n   * a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc * cos(A)\n   * Where 'a' is the diagonal, 'b' and 'c' are sides of the equilateral triangle, and A is the angle between 'b' and 'c' (120 degrees).\n**5. Calculation:**\n* a\u00b2 = 6\u00b2 + 6\u00b2 - 2(6)(6) * cos(120\u00b0)\n* a\u00b2 = 36 + 36 + 72 \n* a\u00b2 = 144\n* a = 12 units (The length of the diagonal)\n**6.  The Answer:**\nThe two parallel sides of the trapezoid have lengths of 6 units and 12 units.  Therefore, the distance between them is **6 units**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Visualize the Hexagon:**\nImagine a regular hexagon. It has six equal sides and six equal angles.  Draw a line segment connecting the midpoints of two opposite sides of the hexagon. This line segment will be perpendicular to the parallel sides and will divide the hexagon into two congruent trapezoids.\n**2. Focus on One Trapezoid:**\nConsider one of the trapezoids. The top base of the trapezoid is a side of the hexagon (6 units). The bottom base is the line segment we drew, which we need to find. \n**3. Divide the Trapezoid:**\nDraw a line segment from one of the top vertices of the trapezoid to the midpoint of the bottom base. This divides the trapezoid into a right triangle and a rectangle.\n**4. Analyze the Right Triangle:**\n* The hypotenuse of the right triangle is half a side of the hexagon (6/2 = 3 units).\n* One leg of the right triangle is half the length of the bottom base of the trapezoid. \n* The other leg is the height of the trapezoid, which is the distance between the parallel sides we want to find.\n**5. Use Trigonometry:**\nSince the angles of a regular hexagon are 120 degrees, each angle of the trapezoid is 60 degrees.  The right triangle we formed has a 30-60-90 angle pattern. \n* **Short Leg:** The short leg of a 30-60-90 triangle is half the length of the hypotenuse. So, the short leg (half the bottom base) is 3/2 units.\n* **Long Leg:** The long leg of a 30-60-90 triangle is \u221a3 times the length of the short leg. So, the long leg (the height of the trapezoid) is (3/2)\u221a3 units.\n**6.  The Final Answer:**\nSince the height of the trapezoid is the distance between the parallel sides, the answer is **(3/2)\u221a3 units**. \n",
