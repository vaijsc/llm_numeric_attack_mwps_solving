Substituting $x=3$ back into $y=4x-6$, we find $y=6$.  Therefore, $(3,6)$ is one of the vertices of the triangle.  The other two vertices are the $y$-intercepts of the two lines, namely $(0,12)$ and $(0,-6)$.  Taking the side joining $(0,12)$ and $(0,-6)$ as the base of the triangle, we find that the area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}(\\text{base})(\\text{height})=\\frac{1}{2}(12-(-6))(3)=\\boxed{27}$ square units.\n\n[asy]\n\nunitsize(3mm);\n\ndefaultpen(linewidth(.7pt)+fontsize(8pt));\n\ndotfactor=4;\n\nfill((0,-6)--(0,12)--(3,6)--cycle,gray);\n\ndraw((-2,0)--(4,0),Arrows(4));\n\ndraw((0,-7)--(0,13),Arrows(4));\n\ndraw((0,-6)--(3,6));\n\ndraw((0,12)--(3,6)); [/asy]",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the points of intersection**\n* **Intersection of the two lines:**  Set the equations equal to each other to find the x-coordinate of the intersection:\n   ```\n   4x - 6 = -2x + 12\n   6x = 18\n   x = 3 \n   ```\n   Substitute this value of x into either equation to find the y-coordinate:\n   ```\n   y = 4(3) - 6 = 6\n   ```\n   Therefore, the lines intersect at the point (3, 6).\n* **Intersection of the line y = 4x - 6 with the y-axis:**  The y-axis corresponds to x = 0. Substitute x = 0 into the equation:\n   ```\n   y = 4(0) - 6 = -6\n   ```\n   So, the line intersects the y-axis at (0, -6).\n* **Intersection of the line y = -2x + 12 with the y-axis:** Substitute x = 0 into the equation:\n   ```\n   y = -2(0) + 12 = 12\n   ```\n   The line intersects the y-axis at (0, 12).\n**2. Visualize the shape**\nThe lines and the y-axis form a triangle. \n**3. Calculate the base and height of the triangle**\n* **Base:** The base of the triangle lies along the y-axis, between the points (0, -6) and (0, 12). The length of the base is 12 - (-6) = 18 units.\n* **Height:** The height of the triangle is the perpendicular distance from the point of intersection of the lines (3, 6) to the y-axis. This distance is simply the x-coordinate of the point of intersection, which is 3 units.\n**4. Calculate the area of the triangle**\nThe area of a triangle is given by (1/2) * base * height.\nArea = (1/2) * 18 * 3 = 27 square units\n**Therefore, the area of the interior region formed by the lines and the y-axis is 27 square units.** \n",
