        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Recognize Similar Triangles**\nTriangles $BDC$ and $ADC$ share angle $DCB$.  Since $\\angle BAC = 30^\\circ$, and the angles of a triangle add up to $180^\\circ$, we know $\\angle ACB = 180^\\circ - 90^\\circ - 30^\\circ = 60^\\circ$.  Therefore, $\\angle BDC = \\angle ADC = 180^\\circ - 60^\\circ - 30^\\circ = 90^\\circ$.  This means triangles $BDC$ and $ADC$ are similar, since they have two congruent angles.\n**2.  Understand the Ratio of Corresponding Sides**\nSince the triangles are similar, the ratio of their corresponding sides is the same.  Let $BD = x$ and $AD = y$.  Then, the ratio of corresponding sides is $x/y$.\n**3. Use the Area Ratio**\nThe ratio of the areas of similar figures is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides.  Therefore, \n\\[\\frac{\\text{Area of } BDC}{\\text{Area of } ADC} = \\left(\\frac{x}{y}\\right)^2.\\]\n**4. Find the Ratio of Corresponding Sides**\nSince triangle $ABC$ is a 30-60-90 triangle, the ratio of the shorter leg to the longer leg is $1:\\sqrt{3}$.  This means $BC = \\sqrt{3} \\cdot AB$.  Also, since $BD$ is the shorter leg of triangle $BDC$, we have $BD = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\cdot BC = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\cdot \\sqrt{3} \\cdot AB = AB$.  Since $AD$ is the longer leg of triangle $ADC$, we have $AD = \\sqrt{3} \\cdot BD = \\sqrt{3} \\cdot AB$.  Therefore, the ratio of the corresponding sides is $BD/AD = AB/(\\sqrt{3} \\cdot AB) = 1/\\sqrt{3}$.\n**5. Calculate the Area Ratio**\nFinally, we have \\[\\frac{\\text{Area of } BDC}{\\text{Area of } ADC} = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^2 = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}.\\]",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Recognize Similar Triangles:**\n*  Triangle *ADC* and triangle *BDC* share the same height (the perpendicular distance from point *D* to line *AC*). \n*  The ratio of their bases, *AC* to *BC*, is 2:1 (since triangle *ABC* is a 30-60-90 triangle, the shorter leg is half the hypotenuse).\n**2. Area Ratio:**\n* The area of a triangle is (1/2) * base * height.  \n* Since the triangles share the same height, the ratio of their areas is directly proportional to the ratio of their bases.\n**3. Conclusion:**\n* The ratio of the area of triangle *BDC* to the area of triangle *ADC* is **1/2**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Recognize Similar Triangles**\n* Triangles $ADC$ and $BDC$ share the same altitude from vertex $D$. \n* Both triangles have a 30-degree angle at vertex C.\n* Therefore, triangles $ADC$ and $BDC$ are similar.\n**2. Ratios of Sides in Similar Triangles**\n* The ratio of corresponding sides in similar triangles is constant. \n* Since $\\angle DCB = 30^\\circ$, we know $BC$ is twice the length of $DC$ (this comes from the special 30-60-90 right triangle properties).\n**3. Area Ratio**\n* The ratio of the areas of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides.\n* Since $BC$ is twice the length of $DC$, the area of triangle $BDC$ is $2^2 = 4$ times the area of triangle $ADC$.\n**Answer:** The ratio of the area of triangle $BDC$ to the area of triangle $ADC$ is **4/1**. \n",

Understanding the Geometry**\n*  Triangle ABC is an equilateral triangle (all angles are 60 degrees).\n*  Triangle ADC is a 30-60-90 triangle (since angle DAC is 60 degrees and angle ADC is 90 degrees).\n**2.  Key Properties of 30-60-90 Triangles**\nIn a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides have a specific ratio:\n* **Hypotenuse:**  2 times the shorter leg\n* **Longer leg:** \u221a3 times the shorter leg\n**3.
