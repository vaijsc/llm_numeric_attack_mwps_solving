    "problem": "A right triangle has leg lengths of 7 and 24 units. A second triangle is similar to the first triangle and has a hypotenuse of 100 units. What is the length, in units, of the shorter leg of the second triangle?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "$7^2+24^2=625=25^2$, so the hypotenuse is $25$. $100$ is $4$ times this, so the shorter leg of the second triangle is $4$ times the shorter leg of the original triangle, or $4(7)=\\boxed{28}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the hypotenuse of the first triangle:**\n*  Use the Pythagorean theorem:  a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n*  Where a = 7, b = 24, and c is the hypotenuse.\n*  7\u00b2 + 24\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n*  49 + 576 = c\u00b2\n*  625 = c\u00b2\n*  c = \u221a625 = 25 \n**2. Determine the scale factor:**\n* The hypotenuse of the second triangle is 100 units, and the hypotenuse of the first triangle is 25 units. \n* The scale factor is 100/25 = 4\n**3. Find the shorter leg of the second triangle:**\n* The shorter leg of the first triangle is 7 units.\n* Multiply this length by the scale factor: 7 * 4 = 28\n**Answer:** The length of the shorter leg of the second triangle is **28 units**. \n",
