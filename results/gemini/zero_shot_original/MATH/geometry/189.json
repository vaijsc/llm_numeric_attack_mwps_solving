        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Understanding the Diagram**\n* Draw a circle with center O.\n* Draw a diameter AB.\n* Place point C on the circle so that angle COB is 50 degrees.\n**2. Key Properties**\n* **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** An inscribed angle (an angle formed by two chords with its vertex on the circle) is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc.\n* **Diameter as a Central Angle:**  A diameter of a circle divides it into two semicircles, each with a central angle of 180 degrees.\n**3. Applying the Properties**\n* **Arc ACB:** Since AB is a diameter, arc ACB is a semicircle, and therefore has a central angle of 180 degrees.\n* **Angle CAB:**  Angle CAB is an inscribed angle that subtends arc ACB.  By the Inscribed Angle Theorem, \n   \n   \u2220CAB = (1/2) * \u2220COB = (1/2) * 180\u00b0 = **90\u00b0**\n**Therefore, the degree measure of \u2220CAB is 90\u00b0.** \n",

Identify the Intercepted Arc**\n* In our problem, $\\angle CAB$ is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc $CB$.\n**3. Find the Measure of the Intercepted Arc**\n* Since $\\angle COB$ is a central angle, it has the same measure as its intercepted arc, which is also arc $CB$.

Applying the Properties**\n* Since AB is a diameter, \u2220ACB is inscribed in a semicircle, making \u2220ACB = 90\u00b0.\n* Arc CB is intercepted by \u2220COB, so the measure of arc CB is 2 * \u2220COB = 2 * 50\u00b0 = 100\u00b0.\n* Arc CAB is the entire circle minus arc CB, so its measure is 360\u00b0 - 100\u00b0 = 260\u00b0.\n* \u2220CAB intercepts arc CB, so \u2220CAB = (1/2) * 260\u00b0 = 130\u00b0.\n**Answer:** The degree measure of \u2220CAB is **130\u00b0**. \n",
