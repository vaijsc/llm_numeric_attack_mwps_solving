So, the side length of the base is 3.  Since the pyramid is a right regular pyramid, each edge from the apex to a vertex of the base has the same length.  So, the sum of the lengths of the edges from the apex to the vertices on the base is $6\\cdot 6 = 36$.  Adding the perimeter of the base gives us the sum of all the edge lengths, which is $36 + 6\\cdot 3 = \\boxed{54}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Pyramid**\nImagine a regular hexagon as the base of the pyramid.  Each vertex of the hexagon is connected to a point directly above the center of the hexagon, forming the apex (point P) of the pyramid.\n**2.  Equilateral Triangle**\nWe're given that triangle PAD is equilateral with side length 6. This means that PA = PD = AD = 6.\n**3. Hexagon Sides**\nSince the hexagon is regular, all its sides are equal.  We need to find the length of one side of the hexagon (say AB).\n**4. Key Insight**\nNotice that triangle PAD is a face of the pyramid, and since it's equilateral, each angle in triangle PAD is 60 degrees.  Also,  angle APB is 120 degrees (because AB is one of the sides of the hexagon).\n**5. Finding AB**\n* Draw a line from P to the midpoint of AB (let's call this point M).  \n* Triangle PAM is a 30-60-90 triangle (angle PAM is 60 degrees, angle PMA is 90 degrees).\n* In a 30-60-90 triangle, the hypotenuse is twice the length of the shorter leg, and the longer leg is \u221a3 times the length of the shorter leg.\n* Since PA = 6, the shorter leg PM is 6/2 = 3.\n* The longer leg AM is 3\u221a3.\n* Since AM is half of AB, then AB = 2 * 3\u221a3 = 6\u221a3.\n**6. Calculating the Total Edge Length**\n* The pyramid has 12 edges: 6 base edges (AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FA) and 6 slant edges (PA, PB, PC, PD, PE, PF).\n* Total edge length = (6 base edges * length of each base edge) + (6 slant edges * length of each slant edge)\n* Total edge length = (6 * 6\u221a3) + (6 * 6) = 36\u221a3 + 36\n**Answer:** The sum of the lengths of the edges of the pyramid is **36\u221a3 + 36**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Pyramid**\nImagine a regular hexagon as the base of a pyramid.  The apex of the pyramid, point *P*, is directly above the center of the hexagon.  Since triangle *PAD* is equilateral, it means that the slant height of the pyramid (the height of a triangular face) is 6.\n[asy]\nimport three;\nsize(180);\ncurrentprojection = perspective(6,3,2);\ntriple A, B, C, D, E, F, P;\nA = (1,0,0);\nB = rotate(60)*(A);\nC = rotate(60)*(B);\nD = rotate(60)*(C);\nE = rotate(60)*(D);\nF = rotate(60)*(E);\nP = (0,0,1);\ndraw(B--C--D--E--F--A--cycle);\ndraw(P--A);\ndraw(P--B);\ndraw(P--C);\ndraw(P--D);\ndraw(P--E);\ndraw(P--F);\ndraw(A--D,dashed);\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, S);\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, SW);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, W);\nlabel(\"$D$\", D, NW);\nlabel(\"$E$\", E, N);\nlabel(\"$F$\", F, NE);\nlabel(\"$P$\", P, N);\n[/asy]\n**2. Find the Side Length of the Hexagon**\n* Since triangle *PAD* is equilateral, angle *PAD* is 60 degrees.\n* The hexagon is regular, so each interior angle is 120 degrees.\n* Therefore, angle *DAP* is 60 degrees.\n* This means triangle *DAP* is also equilateral.\nSince the hexagon is regular, the length of each side of the hexagon is equal to the side length of the equilateral triangle *PAD*, which is 6.\n**3. Calculate the Total Edge Length**\n* **Base Edges:** The hexagon has 6 edges, each of length 6, for a total of 6 * 6 = 36.\n* **Slant Edges:** The pyramid has 6 slant edges (PA, PB, PC, PD, PE, PF), each of length 6, for a total of 6 * 6 = 36.\n**4. Sum the Edge Lengths**\nThe sum of the lengths of all the edges of the pyramid is 36 (base edges) + 36 (slant edges) = **72**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Visualize the Pyramid**\nImagine a regular hexagon as the base.  From each vertex of the hexagon, a line segment extends vertically upward to a common point, forming the apex (point P) of the pyramid. Since the pyramid is right, the apex P is directly above the center of the hexagon.\n**2.  Focus on the Base**\nThe base is a regular hexagon.  All sides of the hexagon are equal, and all interior angles are 120 degrees.\n**3.  Analyze the Equilateral Triangle**\nWe are given that triangle PAD is equilateral with side length 6.  This means all sides of this triangle are 6 units long.\n**4.  Find the Height of the Pyramid**\nSince triangle PAD is equilateral, we can draw an altitude from P to AD, which will bisect AD and form a right triangle. This right triangle will have legs of length 3 (half of AD) and a hypotenuse of length 6 (side of PAD). Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the height of the pyramid:\n*  3\u00b2 + height\u00b2 = 6\u00b2\n*  height\u00b2 = 27\n*  height = 3\u221a3\n**5. Calculate Edge Lengths**\n*  **Base edges:**  The base hexagon has 6 edges, each of length 6 (since triangle PAD is equilateral, and AD is a side of the hexagon).\n*  **Lateral edges:** The lateral edges are the lines connecting the apex (P) to each vertex of the hexagon.  Since the pyramid is right, all lateral edges are congruent and have the same length.  We can find this length using the Pythagorean theorem on a right triangle formed by the height of the pyramid, half the length of a side of the hexagon, and the lateral edge:\n    * (3\u221a3)\u00b2 + 3\u00b2 = lateral edge\u00b2\n    * 27 + 9 = lateral edge\u00b2\n    * lateral edge = 6\n**6.  Sum the Edge Lengths**\n*  6 base edges: 6 * 6 = 36\n*  6 lateral edges: 6 * 6 = 36\n*  Total sum: 36 + 36 = **72**\n**Therefore, the sum of the lengths of the edges of the pyramid is 72.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Pyramid**\nImagine a regular hexagon as the base of the pyramid.  Then, picture an equilateral triangle rising up from the base, with one vertex at the apex (point P) of the pyramid. This triangle will be the face PAD.\n**2. Understand the Geometry**\n* **Regular Hexagon:**  A regular hexagon has 6 equal sides and 6 equal angles. Each angle measures 120 degrees.\n* **Equilateral Triangle:**  An equilateral triangle has 3 equal sides and 3 equal angles. Each angle measures 60 degrees.\n* **Right Pyramid:**  A right pyramid has its apex directly above the center of its base.\n**3. Find the Side Lengths**\nSince PAD is equilateral with side length 6, we know:\n* PA = AD = PD = 6\n**4. Find the Base Edge Length**\n* Draw a diagonal of the hexagon, connecting opposite vertices (let's say AC). This diagonal divides the hexagon into two congruent trapezoids.\n* The diagonal AC also divides the equilateral triangle PAD into two congruent 30-60-90 right triangles (PAC and DAC). \n* In triangle PAC, we know PA = 6 and angle PAC = 60 degrees.  Since it's a 30-60-90 triangle, we can use the side ratios:\n    * The hypotenuse (PA) is twice the shorter leg (PC). So, PC = 6/2 = 3.\n    * The longer leg (AC) is \u221a3 times the shorter leg (PC). So, AC = 3\u221a3.\n* The side length of the hexagon (AB) is half of the length of the diagonal AC. Therefore, AB = (3\u221a3)/2.\n**5. Calculate the Total Edge Length**\nThe pyramid has:\n* 6 base edges (each AB = (3\u221a3)/2): 6 * (3\u221a3)/2 = 9\u221a3\n* 6 slant edges (each PA = 6): 6 * 6 = 36\n* 1 apex edge (the height of the pyramid):  This is not directly given, but we know that the pyramid is right, so the height is the perpendicular distance from P to the center of the hexagon. We can use the Pythagorean Theorem on triangle PAC to find the height, but we don't need it for the total edge length.\n**6. The Sum of Edge Lengths**\nThe total sum of the edge lengths is: 9\u221a3 + 36 = **36 + 9\u221a3** \n",

Then, picture a point *P* directly above the center of the hexagon, forming the apex of the pyramid.  Since the pyramid is right, all the edges from *P* to the vertices of the hexagon are perpendicular to the base.\n**2.  Understanding the Equilateral Triangle**\nWe know that triangle *PAD* is equilateral with side length 6. This means all angles in this triangle are 60 degrees, and all sides are equal.\n**3.  Finding the Height of the Pyramid**\n* Draw an altitude from *P* to the base of the hexagon, and label the intersection point as *O*.  This altitude will bisect the base of the equilateral triangle *PAD*.\n* Triangle *POD* is a 30-60-90 right triangle.  Since *PD* = 6, we know *DO* = 3 (half of *PD*) and *PO* (the height of the pyramid) is 3\u221a3 (the longer leg is \u221a3 times the shorter leg in a 30-60-90 triangle).\n**4.  Finding the Side Length of the Hexagon**\n* Since *PAD* is equilateral, and *O* is the midpoint of *AD*, then triangle *AOD* is a 30-60-90 right triangle as well.\n* We know *DO* = 3, so *AO* (which is half the side length of the hexagon) is 3\u221a3 (the longer leg is \u221a3 times the shorter leg).\n* Therefore, the side length of the hexagon is 2 * 3\u221a3 = 6\u221a3.\n**5.  Calculating the Total Edge Length**\n* **Base edges:**  The hexagon has 6 sides of length 6\u221a3, so the total base edge length is 6 * 6\u221a3 = 36\u221a3.\n* **Lateral edges:** The pyramid has 6 lateral edges, each with length 6.  So the total lateral edge length is 6 * 6 = 36.\n* **Total edge length:** The sum of all edges is 36\u221a3 + 36 = **36(\u221a3 + 1)**. \n"
