        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand Line of Symmetry**\nA line of symmetry divides a figure into two identical mirror images.  When a figure has a line of symmetry, any point on one side of the line has a corresponding point on the other side, the same distance away from the line.\n**2.  Analyze the Diagonal**\nThe diagonal BD divides the square into two congruent right triangles, ABD and BCD.  For the square to have a line of symmetry along BD, the corresponding squares on either side of BD must be colored black.\n**3. Identify Matching Squares**\n* **Square (1,0)  matches  (0,1)**  (These are both already black)\n* **Square (2,0) matches (0,2)** (One is black, the other needs to be colored)\n* **Square (3,0) matches (0,3)** (One is black, the other needs to be colored)\n* **Square (4,0) matches (0,4)** (One is black, the other needs to be colored)\n* **Square (3,1) matches (1,3)** (One is black, the other needs to be colored)\n* **Square (4,1) matches (1,4)** (One is black, the other needs to be colored)\n* **Square (4,2) matches (2,4)** (One is black, the other needs to be colored)\n* **Square (4,3) matches (3,4)** (Both are already black)\n**4.

        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding Line Symmetry**\nA line of symmetry divides a shape into two mirror images.  When a shape has a diagonal line of symmetry, each square on one side of the diagonal must have a corresponding, identically colored square on the other side.\n**Analyzing the Diagram**\n* **Squares Already Symmetrical:**  The squares at positions (1,1) and (3,3) are already symmetrical across the diagonal BD.\n* **Squares Needing Matching Colors:**\n    * The black square at (1,0) needs a matching black square at (3,2).\n    * The black square at (0,3) needs a matching black square at (2,1).\n    * The black square at (2,3) needs a matching black square at (4,1).\n    * The black square at (3,1) needs a matching black square at (1,3).\n**Solution**\nWe need to color a minimum of **four** more squares black to achieve symmetry across diagonal BD. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**Understanding Line Symmetry**\nA line of symmetry divides a figure into two identical halves that mirror each other.  In this case, we want the diagonal $\\overline{BD}$ to be the line of symmetry.\n**Analyzing the Grid**\n* **Squares on the diagonal:**  The squares that lie directly on the diagonal $\\overline{BD}$ (the squares with coordinates (1,1), (2,2), and (3,3)) are already symmetrical. We don't need to change them.\n* **Matching Pairs:** For every square above the diagonal, there's a corresponding square below the diagonal that must have the same color to maintain symmetry.  \n**Finding the Minimum**\n* **Already Symmetric:**  Notice that the square at (1,0) is already symmetric to the square at (0,1).  Similarly, the square at (4,3) is symmetric to the square at (3,4).\n* **Missing Symmetry:**  The square at (3,1) needs a corresponding black square at (1,3) to achieve symmetry.\n**Solution**\nTherefore, the minimum number of small squares that must be colored black is **1**. We need to color the square at **(1,3)** black. \n",

In this case, we want the diagonal  $\\overline{BD}$ to be the line of symmetry.\n**2. Analyze the Grid**\nNotice that the grid has 25 small squares.  We need to color some squares black so that when the grid is folded along the diagonal, the black squares on one side perfectly match up with the black squares on the other side.\n**3. Identify Squares Already Symmetrical**\nThe square in the top left corner is already symmetrical with the square in the bottom right corner. Similarly, the square in the top right corner is symmetrical with the square in the bottom left corner. \n**4. Focus on the Remaining Squares**\nThe remaining squares are the ones along the diagonal itself and the ones on either side of it.\n**5.  Pairing for Symmetry**\n*   **Squares on the Diagonal:**  The square in the center of the grid (where the diagonals intersect) is already symmetrical.  \n*   **Squares Off the Diagonal:**  Consider the square directly above the diagonal (the square to the right of the top left square).  It needs to be symmetrical with the square directly below the diagonal (the square to the left of the bottom right square).  This pattern continues for all the squares off the diagonal.\n**6. Determine the Minimum Number**\nTo achieve symmetry, we need to color at least one square from each pair on either side of the diagonal. Since there are three pairs of squares off the diagonal, we need to color at least **3** additional squares. \n**7. The Answer**\nThe minimum number of squares that must be colored black is 3 (the 3 pairs of squares off the diagonal). \n",
