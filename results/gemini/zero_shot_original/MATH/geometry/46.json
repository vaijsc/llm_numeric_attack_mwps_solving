        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Situation**\nImagine the card folding.  As the card opens, point B travels along a circular arc.  We need to find the length of this arc and compare it to the distance point A travels.\n**2. Find the Radius of the Arc**\nPoint B travels along an arc of a circle with center at the fold of the card.  The radius of this circle is the distance from the fold to point B, which is 5 inches.\n**3. Find the Central Angle**\nThe card opens to a 45-degree angle.  This is the central angle of the arc.\n**4. Calculate the Arc Length**\nThe arc length is a fraction of the circumference of the circle.  Since the central angle is 45 degrees (1/8 of a full circle), the arc length is:\n(1/8) * (2\u03c0 * 5 inches) = (5\u03c0/4) inches\n**5. Calculate the Distance Point A Travels**\nPoint A travels in a straight line.  Since the card opens to 45 degrees, the distance point A travels is the hypotenuse of a 45-45-90 triangle.  The legs of this triangle are 3 inches each (the distance from the fold to point A), so the hypotenuse is 3\u221a2 inches.\n**6. Find the Difference**\nThe difference in the distances traveled by points A and B is:\n(5\u03c0/4) inches - 3\u221a2 inches\n**Answer:**\nPoint B travels **(5\u03c0/4 - 3\u221a2)** inches more than point A. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Movement**\nImagine the card being opened like a book.  Point B will trace a circular arc as the card opens.

Find the Radii**\n* **Radius of B's arc:** The radius of the arc that point B travels is the length of the diagonal of the card, which is  $\\sqrt{6^2 + 8^2} = 10$ inches.\n* **Radius of A's arc:** The radius of the arc that point A travels is the distance from point A to the fold, which is 5 inches.\n**3. Calculate the Arc Lengths**\n* **Arc length of B:** The central angle of the arc is 45 degrees, which is $\\frac{\\pi}{4}$ radians. The arc length is given by  $s = r\\theta = 10 \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{4} = \\frac{5\\pi}{2}$ inches.\n* **Arc length of A:** The arc length of A is $s = r\\theta = 5 \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{4} = \\frac{5\\pi}{4}$ inches.\n**4.

Calculate the Arc Lengths**\n* **Arc length of B:**  The arc length of a sector is a fraction of the circumference of the circle.  Since the angle is 45 degrees (1/8 of a full circle), the arc length of B is (1/8) * 2 * pi * 8 = 2pi inches.\n* **Arc length of A:**  The arc length of A is (1/8) * 2 * pi * 3 = (3/4)pi inches.\n**4. Find the Difference**\nThe difference in the distances traveled by points B and A is the difference in their arc lengths: 2pi - (3/4)pi = **(5/4)pi inches**. \n",

Find the Arc Length**\nThe arc that point B travels along is a 45-degree segment of a circle with radius \u221a34 inches. The circumference of this circle is 2\u03c0\u221a34 inches.  Since a 45-degree arc is 1/8 of the entire circle, the arc length is:\n(1/8) * 2\u03c0\u221a34 = (\u03c0\u221a34)/4 inches\n**4. Determine the Additional Distance**\nPoint B travels (\u03c0\u221a34)/4 inches along the arc.  We need to find the difference between this distance and the distance point A travels, which is the straight line distance from point A to the point where point B ends up.\nThis straight line distance is the same as the length of the radius, \u221a34 inches.\nTherefore, point B travels (\u03c0\u221a34)/4 - \u221a34 inches more than point A.\n**Answer:** Point B travels **(\u03c0\u221a34)/4 - \u221a34** inches more than point A. \n",

Since the card is 6 inches wide and point A is 3 inches from the fold, point B is also 3 inches from the fold.  Therefore, the radius of the arc is 3 inches.\n**3.
