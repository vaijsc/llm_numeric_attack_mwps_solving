        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Rotation**\nWhen we rotate a right triangle about one of its legs, we get a cone.  The leg we rotate around becomes the height of the cone, and the other leg becomes the radius of the cone's base.\n**2. Determine the Optimal Rotation**\nTo maximize the volume of the cone, we want the largest possible radius.  Therefore, we should rotate the triangle about the leg of length 4 cm.\n**3. Calculate the Cone's Dimensions**\n* **Height (h):**  The height of the cone is the leg we rotate around, which is 4 cm.\n* **Radius (r):** The radius of the cone's base is the other leg, which is 3 cm.\n**4. Calculate the Cone's Volume**\nThe volume of a cone is given by:  \n* **V = (1/3)\u03c0r\u00b2h**\nSubstitute the values we found:\n* **V = (1/3)\u03c0(3\u00b2)(4)**\n* **V = 12\u03c0**\n**5. Approximate the Answer**\nSince \u03c0 \u2248 3.14, we have:\n* **V \u2248 12(3.14) \u2248 37.68**\n**Answer:** The greatest possible volume of the resulting solid is approximately **38 cubic centimeters**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**Understanding the Solid**\nWhen you rotate a right triangle about one of its legs, you create a cone.  The leg you rotate around becomes the cone's height, and the other leg becomes the cone's radius.\n**Finding the Maximum Volume**\nTo maximize the volume of the cone, we want the radius to be as large as possible.

Determine the Greatest Volume**\nThe cone formed by rotating around AB (with a volume of 16\u03c0 cubic cm) has the greater volume.\n**4.
