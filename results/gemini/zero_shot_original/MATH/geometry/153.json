        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the side length of the square base:**\n* The area of a square is side * side (s\u00b2)\n* We know the area is 288 cm\u00b2\n* So, s\u00b2 = 288 \n* Taking the square root of both sides, we get s = \u221a288 = 12\u221a2 cm\n**2. Visualize the pyramid:**\n* Imagine the pyramid with its peak directly above the center of the square base. \n* Draw a line from the peak to the center of the base, and then another line from the peak to one of the corners of the base. This forms a right triangle.\n**3. Identify the sides of the right triangle:**\n* The base of the triangle is half the diagonal of the square base. \n*  To find the diagonal, use the Pythagorean theorem: diagonal\u00b2 = side\u00b2 + side\u00b2 = 12\u221a2\u00b2 + 12\u221a2\u00b2 = 288 + 288 = 576\n* So, the diagonal is \u221a576 = 24 cm\n* The base of our triangle is half the diagonal, which is 24/2 = 12 cm\n* The height of the triangle is the height of the pyramid, which is given as 15 cm.\n**4. Calculate the volume:**\n* The volume of a pyramid is (1/3) * base area * height\n* Base area is 288 cm\u00b2\n* Height is 15 cm\n* Therefore, the volume is (1/3) * 288 * 15 = **1440 cubic centimeters**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the side length of the square base:**\n* Since the area of the square base is 288 cm\u00b2, the side length is the square root of 288 cm\u00b2. \n* \u221a288 = \u221a(144 * 2) = 12\u221a2 cm\n**2. Visualize the pyramid:**\n* Imagine the pyramid with its apex directly above the center of the square base. \n* Draw a line from the apex to the center of the base. This line represents the height of the pyramid.\n* Now draw a line from the apex to one of the corners of the base. This line is 15 cm long (given in the problem).\n**3. Use the Pythagorean theorem:**\n* The line connecting the apex to the center of the base, the line connecting the center of the base to a corner, and the line connecting the apex to a corner form a right triangle.\n* The line connecting the center of the base to a corner is half the diagonal of the square base, which is (12\u221a2)/2 = 6\u221a2 cm.\n* We know the hypotenuse of this right triangle is 15 cm, and one leg is 6\u221a2 cm.  Let the height of the pyramid be represented by 'h'.\n* Using the Pythagorean theorem:  h\u00b2 + (6\u221a2)\u00b2 = 15\u00b2 \n* Simplifying: h\u00b2 + 72 = 225\n* Solving for h: h\u00b2 = 153, h = \u221a153 = 3\u221a17 cm\n**4. Calculate the volume:**\n* The volume of a pyramid is (1/3) * (area of base) * (height)\n* Volume = (1/3) * 288 cm\u00b2 * 3\u221a17 cm\n* Volume = **288\u221a17 cubic centimeters** \n",

Visualize the pyramid:**\n* Imagine the pyramid with its peak directly above the center of the square base.\n* Draw a line from the peak to the center of the base, and then draw a line from the center of the base to one of the vertices of the square. This creates a right triangle.\n**3. Identify the triangle's dimensions:**\n* The base of the triangle is half the diagonal of the square base.\n* The diagonal of a square is \u221a2 times the side length, so the base of the triangle is (12\u221a2 cm) / 2 = 6\u221a2 cm.\n* The height of the triangle is the height of the pyramid, which is 15 cm.\n**4. Calculate the area of the base:**\n* The area of the square base is already given as 288 cm\u00b2.\n**5. Calculate the volume:**\n* The volume of a pyramid is (1/3) * (area of the base) * (height)\n* Volume = (1/3) * 288 cm\u00b2 * 15 cm = **1440 cubic centimeters** \n",

This line is half the diagonal of the square base.\n**3. Use the Pythagorean Theorem:**\n* We have a right triangle formed by the height (h), half the diagonal of the square base, and the line from the peak to a corner (15 cm).\n* The diagonal of a square is \u221a2 times the side length, so half the diagonal is (1/2)(\u221a2)(12\u221a2) = 12 cm.\n* Using the Pythagorean Theorem:  h\u00b2 + 12\u00b2 = 15\u00b2\n* Solving for h: h\u00b2 = 15\u00b2 - 12\u00b2 = 81, so h = \u221a81 = 9 cm.\n**4.

A line from the peak to the center of the base is the height of the pyramid. \n*  A line from the peak to a vertex of the base forms a right triangle.  The height of the pyramid is one leg of this triangle, and half the diagonal of the square base is the other leg.\n**3. Find the length of the diagonal of the square base:**\n* The diagonal of a square divides it into two 45-45-90 right triangles.\n* The ratio of the sides in a 45-45-90 triangle is 1:1:\u221a2.\n* Since the side of our square is 12\u221a2 cm, the diagonal is (12\u221a2)\u221a2 = 24 cm.\n**4. Find the height of the pyramid:**\n* Half the diagonal of the square base is 24 cm / 2 = 12 cm.\n* This is one leg of the right triangle we described earlier. The other leg is the height of the pyramid, and the hypotenuse is 15 cm (the distance from the peak to a vertex).\n* Using the Pythagorean theorem: height\u00b2 + 12\u00b2 = 15\u00b2\n* Solving for height: height\u00b2 = 15\u00b2 - 12\u00b2 = 81 \n* Therefore, height = \u221a81 = 9 cm.\n**5.
