We are given the lengths of AC, BK, and CK. We need to find AB.\n**2. Use the Pythagorean Theorem**\nSince AK is an altitude, we have two right triangles:  \u25b3AKC and \u25b3AKB.  We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find AK:\n* In \u25b3AKC:  $AK^2 + CK^2 = AC^2$ \n   Substituting, we get  $AK^2 + 4^2 = 9^2$\n   Simplifying, we get $AK^2 = 65$ \n   Therefore, $AK = \\sqrt{65}$\n**3. Find AB**\n* In \u25b3AKB:  $AK^2 + BK^2 = AB^2$ \n   Substituting, we get $(\\sqrt{65})^2 + (\\sqrt{5})^2 = AB^2$\n   Simplifying, we get $65 + 5 = AB^2$\n   Therefore, $AB^2 = 70$ and $AB = \\boxed{\\sqrt{70}}$. \n",
