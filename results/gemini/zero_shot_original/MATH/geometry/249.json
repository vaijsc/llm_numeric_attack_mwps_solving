    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Let $r, h,$ and $V$, respectively, be the radius, height, and volume of the jar that is currently being used. The new jar will have a radius of $1.25r$ and volume $V$. Let $H$ be the height of the new jar. Then \\[\n\\pi r^{2} h = V = \\pi (1.25r)^{2} H,\\] so \\[\n\\frac{H}{h}=\\frac{1}{(1.25)^{2}}= 0.64.\n\\] Thus $H$ is $64\\%$ of $h$, so the height must be reduced by $(100 - 64)\\% = \\boxed{36} \\%$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Relationships**\n* **Volume of a Cylinder:**  The volume (V) of a cylinder is calculated by the formula V = \u03c0r\u00b2h, where r is the radius and h is the height.\n* **Diameter and Radius:** The diameter (d) is twice the radius (r): d = 2r.\n**2. Set Up the Problem**\nLet:\n*  r\u2081 = original radius\n*  h\u2081 = original height\n*  r\u2082 = new radius (after increasing diameter)\n*  h\u2082 = new height (what we need to find)\nSince the diameter is increased by 25%, the new radius is 1.25 times the original radius:\n*  r\u2082 = 1.25r\u2081\nThe volume remains constant:\n*  \u03c0r\u2081\u00b2h\u2081 = \u03c0r\u2082\u00b2h\u2082\n**3. Solve for the New Height**\nSubstitute r\u2082 = 1.25r\u2081 into the volume equation:\n* \u03c0r\u2081\u00b2h\u2081 = \u03c0(1.25r\u2081)\u00b2h\u2082\n* \u03c0r\u2081\u00b2h\u2081 = 1.5625\u03c0r\u2081\u00b2h\u2082\nCancel out \u03c0r\u2081\u00b2 on both sides:\n* h\u2081 = 1.5625h\u2082\nSolve for h\u2082:\n* h\u2082 = h\u2081 / 1.5625 \n* h\u2082 \u2248 0.64h\u2081\n**4. Calculate the Percent Decrease**\nThe new height is 0.64 times the original height. This means the height has been decreased by:\n* 1 - 0.64 = 0.36  \nTo express this as a percentage, multiply by 100%:\n* 0.36 * 100% = 36%\n**Answer:** The height must be decreased by **36%** to maintain the same volume. \n",

Set Up the Problem**\n* Let the original radius be 'r' and the original height be 'h'.\n* The new radius is 1.25r (since it's increased by 25%).\n* We want to find the new height (let's call it h') that keeps the volume the same.\n**3.  Equate the Volumes**\n* Original Volume = New Volume\n* \u03c0r\u00b2h = \u03c0(1.25r)\u00b2h'\n**4. Simplify and Solve for h'**\n* Cancel out \u03c0 and r\u00b2 on both sides: h = (1.25)\u00b2h'\n* h = 1.5625h'\n* h' = h / 1.5625\n**5. Calculate the Percentage Decrease**\n* The height is now h/1.5625. To find the percentage decrease, we need to calculate how much smaller the new height is compared to the original height.\n* Percentage decrease = ( (original height - new height) / original height ) * 100%\n* Percentage decrease = ( (h - h/1.5625) / h ) * 100%\n* Percentage decrease = ( (1 - 1/1.5625) ) * 100% \n* Percentage decrease = (0.36) * 100% = 36%\n**Answer:** The height of the jars must be decreased by **36%** to maintain the same volume. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Relationship**\n* **Volume of a cylinder:**  V = \u03c0r\u00b2h, where r is the radius and h is the height.\n* **The volume remains constant:**  This means the initial volume (V\u2081) will be equal to the final volume (V\u2082).\n**2.  Express Changes in Terms of Original Dimensions**\n* Let the original radius be 'r' and the original height be 'h'.\n* The new radius is 1.25r (since the diameter increases by 25%, and the radius is half the diameter). \n* Let the new height be 'h\u2081'.\n**3. Set Up the Equation**\nSince the volume remains constant:\nV\u2081 = V\u2082\n\u03c0r\u00b2h = \u03c0(1.25r)\u00b2h\u2081\n**4.

Calculate the Percentage Decrease in Height**\n* Find the difference between the original height (h) and the new height (h\u2081): h - h\u2081 = h - (h / 1.5625) = 0.375h\n* Divide the difference by the original height and multiply by 100% to get the percentage decrease: (0.375h / h) * 100% = 37.5%\n**Answer:** The height of the jars must be decreased by **37.5%**. \n",
