    "solution": "The surface area of the solid can be split into four pieces:  the top and bottom, the curved side, and the flat side.\n\nThe top and bottom pieces are semicircles with radius 6; together, they add up to a circle with radius 6 and area $\\pi(6^2)=36\\pi$.\n\nThe curved side can be rolled out to a rectangle with height 10.  The width of this rectangle is half the circumference of the base of the cylinder, which is $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 2\\pi\\cdot 6 = 6\\pi$.  Thus the area of the curved side is $10\\cdot 6\\pi = 60\\pi$.\n\nThe flat side is a rectangle with height 10.  The width of this rectangle is the diameter of the cylinder, which is $6\\cdot 2 = 12$.  Thus the area of the flat side is $10\\cdot 12 = 120$.\n\nFinally, the total surface area of the solid is $36\\pi+60\\pi+120=\\boxed{96\\pi+120}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Identify the Shapes**\n* **The base:** The base of the solid is a semicircle with radius 6 cm.\n* **The side:**  The side of the solid is a rectangle that was originally the curved surface of the cylinder.\n* **The top:** The top of the solid is also a semicircle with radius 6 cm.\n**2. Calculate the Areas**\n* **Area of the semicircular bases:** Each semicircle has area (1/2)\u03c0(6\u00b2)= 18\u03c0 cm\u00b2.  Since there are two, their combined area is 36\u03c0 cm\u00b2.\n* **Area of the rectangular side:** The rectangle has length equal to the circumference of the base (2\u03c0(6) = 12\u03c0 cm) and height 10 cm. Its area is (12\u03c0)(10) = 120\u03c0 cm\u00b2.\n**3. Total Surface Area**\nThe total surface area is the sum of the areas of the three surfaces:\nTotal Surface Area = Area of bases + Area of side = 36\u03c0 + 120\u03c0 = **156\u03c0 cm\u00b2** \n",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Identify the Shapes:**\n* **The curved surface:** This is a half-cylinder.\n* **The flat surfaces:**  Two semi-circles (the cut ends) and a rectangle (the bottom of the cylinder).\n**2. Calculate the Areas:**\n* **Curved Surface:**  The surface area of a full cylinder is  $2\\pi rh$, where *r* is the radius and *h* is the height.  Since we have half a cylinder, the curved surface area is: \n   (1/2) * 2\u03c0 * 6 * 10 = 60\u03c0 cm\u00b2 \n* **Semi-circles:** The area of a full circle is \u03c0r\u00b2, so the area of a semi-circle is:\n   (1/2) * \u03c0 * 6\u00b2 = 18\u03c0 cm\u00b2 \n   Since we have two semi-circles, the total area is 36\u03c0 cm\u00b2\n* **Rectangle:** The area of a rectangle is length times width. The length of the rectangle is the circumference of the cylinder's base, which is 2\u03c0r. The width is the height of the cylinder.  So the rectangle's area is:\n   2\u03c0 * 6 * 10 = 120\u03c0 cm\u00b2\n**3.
