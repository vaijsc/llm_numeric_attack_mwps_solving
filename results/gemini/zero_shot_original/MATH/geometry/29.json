    "problem": "Two sides of a triangle are each $8$ units long. If the third side has a whole number length, what is the greatest possible perimeter, in units, for the triangle?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The Triangle Inequality says that the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side. That means $8+8=16$ must be greater than the length of the third side. The third side has a whole number length, so the greatest possible length is 15 units. That makes the perimeter $8+8+15=\\boxed{31}$ units.",

        "### Response:\nTo form a triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side.\n* **Consider the two sides of length 8:** Their sum is 16. \n* **The third side must be less than 16:**  If the third side were 16 or greater, the triangle inequality wouldn't hold. \n* **The greatest possible whole number length for the third side is 15.**\nTherefore, the greatest possible perimeter is 8 + 8 + 15 = **31 units**. \n"
