        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Recall the formula for the volume of a cylinder:**\n   The volume (V) of a cylinder is given by:  V = \u03c0r\u00b2h \n   where:\n   * r = radius of the base\n   * h = height of the cylinder\n**2. Identify the given information:**\n   * V = 45\u03c0 cubic cm\n   * r = 3 cm\n**3. Substitute the known values into the volume formula:**\n   45\u03c0 = \u03c0(3)\u00b2h\n**4. Simplify the equation:**\n   45\u03c0 = 9\u03c0h\n**5. Solve for the height (h):**\n   Divide both sides by 9\u03c0:\n   h = 45\u03c0 / 9\u03c0 \n   h = 5 cm\n**Therefore, the height of the cylinder is 5 centimeters.** \n",
