        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Understand the Geometry**\n* We have two equilateral triangles:  \u25b3ABC and \u25b3DEF.\n* \u25b3DEF is inscribed inside \u25b3ABC, meaning its vertices lie on the sides of \u25b3ABC.\n*  ED is perpendicular to BC, making \u25b3BED a right triangle.\n**2.  Key Observations**\n* **Similar Triangles:** Notice that \u25b3BED and \u25b3ABC are similar.  This is because they share two angles:  \u2220B and \u2220BED = \u2220BAC (both are right angles).\n* **Ratio of Sides:** Since \u25b3BED and \u25b3ABC are similar, the ratio of their corresponding sides is constant. In particular,  BE/BA = BD/BC = DE/AC.\n**3.  Finding the Ratio of Areas**\n* **Area of Equilateral Triangle:** The area of an equilateral triangle with side length *s* is given by (\u221a3/4)*s\u00b2. \n* **Ratio of Areas:** The ratio of the areas of two similar figures is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides.\n**4.  Putting it Together**\nLet's say the side length of \u25b3ABC is *a*. Since \u25b3DEF is inscribed in \u25b3ABC, we can express the side lengths of \u25b3DEF in terms of *a*.\n* Since \u25b3BED is a right triangle with \u2220BED = 90\u00b0, we have BE = BD = a/2 (the hypotenuse of \u25b3BED is half the side length of \u25b3ABC).\n* This means DE = a/2 (since \u25b3DEF is equilateral).\nNow, let's calculate the areas:\n* Area of \u25b3ABC: (\u221a3/4)*a\u00b2\n* Area of \u25b3DEF: (\u221a3/4)*(a/2)\u00b2 = (\u221a3/16)*a\u00b2\nThe ratio of the area of \u25b3DEF to the area of \u25b3ABC is:\n(\u221a3/16)*a\u00b2 / (\u221a3/4)*a\u00b2 = **1/4**\n**Therefore, the ratio of the area of \u25b3DEF to the area of \u25b3ABC is 1:4.** \n",
        "Here's a step-by-step solution:\n**1.  Understanding the Geometry**\n*  Since $\\triangle ABC$ is equilateral, all its angles are 60 degrees.\n*  Since $\\triangle DEF$ is equilateral and inscribed within $\\triangle ABC$,  $\\angle EDF = 60^\\circ$.\n*  We are given that $\\overline{ED} \\perp \\overline{BC}$, making $\\angle EDC = 90^\\circ$.\n**2. Finding Key Relationships**\n*  Since $\\angle EDC = 90^\\circ$ and $\\angle DEC = 60^\\circ$, we know that $\\angle ECD = 30^\\circ$.\n*  This means $\\triangle DEC$ is a 30-60-90 right triangle.\n**3. Using Properties of 30-60-90 Triangles**\n* In a 30-60-90 triangle, the hypotenuse is twice the length of the shorter leg, and the longer leg is $\\sqrt{3}$ times the length of the shorter leg.\n* Let $x$ be the length of $\\overline{DE}$.  Then, the length of $\\overline{DC}$ is $x\\sqrt{3}$ and the length of $\\overline{EC}$ is $2x$.\n**4. Expressing Areas**\n* **Area of  $\\triangle DEF$:** Since $\\triangle DEF$ is equilateral, its area is  $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\cdot DE^2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}x^2$.\n* **Area of $\\triangle ABC$:** Let the side length of $\\triangle ABC$ be $s$.  Then the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}s^2$.\n**5. Finding the Ratio**\n*  Notice that $BC = s = 2x + x\\sqrt{3}$.\n*  Therefore, the ratio of the area of $\\triangle DEF$ to the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is:\n$$\\frac{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}x^2}{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}s^2} = \\frac{x^2}{(2x + x\\sqrt{3})^2} = \\frac{1}{(2+\\sqrt{3})^2}$$\n**6. Simplifying the Ratio**\n* To rationalize the denominator, multiply both numerator and denominator by $(2-\\sqrt{3})^2$:\n$$\\frac{1}{(2+\\sqrt{3})^2} \\cdot \\frac{(2-\\sqrt{3})^2}{(2-\\sqrt{3})^2} = \\frac{(2-\\sqrt{3})^2}{1} = \\boxed{7-4\\sqrt{3}}$$ \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understanding the Geometry**\n*  **Equilateral Triangles:** Both triangle ABC and triangle DEF are equilateral, meaning all their sides are equal and all their angles are 60 degrees.\n* **Perpendicular:** Line segment ED is perpendicular to BC, which divides triangle ABC into smaller triangles.\n**2. Finding Key Relationships**\n* **Similar Triangles:** Triangle AED is similar to triangle ABC. Why?  Because they both have a 60-degree angle (at A) and a right angle (at E and B, respectively).  This means their corresponding sides are proportional.\n**3. Using Proportions**\n* **Side Ratio:** Let the side length of triangle ABC be 's'.  Since DE is perpendicular to BC, it bisects BC. So, BC = 2 * BE.  Because triangles AED and ABC are similar,  AD/AB = AE/AC = DE/BC. This simplifies to:\n    * AD/s = AE/s = DE/(2*BE)\n* **Area Ratio:** The area of a triangle is (1/2) * base * height.  \n    * Area of triangle DEF = (1/2) * DE * DF\n    * Area of triangle ABC = (1/2) * BC * AB = (1/2) * (2 * BE) * s = BE * s \n* **Simplifying:**  Since DE/BE = 1/2 (from our proportions above), we can substitute to find the ratio of areas:\n    * (Area of triangle DEF) / (Area of triangle ABC) = [(1/2) * DE * DF] / (BE * s) = [(1/2) * (1/2) * BE * DF] / (BE * s) = (1/4) * DF/s\n**4. Finding DF/s**\n* **Equilateral Triangle Properties:** In equilateral triangle ABC,  the altitude from A to BC bisects BC and is also a median. This means AD = (1/2) * AB = (1/2) * s.\n* **Pythagorean Theorem:**  In right triangle AED,  AD\u00b2 + DE\u00b2 = AE\u00b2.  Substituting the values we found:\n    * (1/2 * s)\u00b2 + DE\u00b2 = s\u00b2\n    * DE\u00b2 = (3/4) * s\u00b2\n    * DE = (\u221a3 / 2) * s\n* **Similar Triangles again:**  Since triangles AED and ABC are similar, DE/BC = DF/AB = (\u221a3 / 2) * s / (2 * s) = \u221a3 / 4. This means DF = (\u221a3 / 4) * s\n**5. Final Ratio**\n* Substitute DF/s back into our area ratio:\n    * (Area of triangle DEF) / (Area of triangle ABC) = (1/4) * (\u221a3 / 4) = **\u221a3 / 16**\n**Therefore, the ratio of the area of triangle DEF to the area of triangle ABC is \u221a3 / 16.** \n",
        "**1.  Understanding the Geometry**\n* **Equilateral Triangles:**  Both triangle ABC and DEF are equilateral, meaning all sides are equal and all angles are 60 degrees.\n* **Perpendicular:**  Line segment ED is perpendicular to BC, creating a right angle.  This is crucial for our area calculations.\n**2.  Finding the Ratio of Side Lengths**\n* Let's say the side length of triangle ABC is  's'.  Since DEF is inscribed, DE and DF are also sides of triangle ABC.\n* Consider triangle BED. It's a 30-60-90 right triangle.  \n    *  Since ED is perpendicular to BC, angle BED is 90 degrees.\n    *  Angle EBD is half of angle ABC (which is 60 degrees), so angle EBD is 30 degrees.\n    *  Therefore, angle DEB is 60 degrees.\n* In a 30-60-90 triangle, the hypotenuse (BD) is twice the length of the shorter leg (ED), and the longer leg (BE) is \u221a3 times the length of the shorter leg (ED).\n* Since BD is half of BC, BD = s/2. Therefore, ED = s/4 (half of BD).\n*  BE is \u221a3 times ED, so BE = (\u221a3)(s/4).\n**3.  Calculating the Areas**\n* **Area of triangle ABC:** The area of an equilateral triangle is (\u221a3/4) * (side)^2.  So the area of triangle ABC is (\u221a3/4) * s^2.\n* **Area of triangle DEF:** The area of a triangle is (1/2) * (base) * (height).  We can use DE as the base and EF as the height.\n    *  DE = s/4\n    *  EF is equal to the height of equilateral triangle ABC minus BE, so EF = (\u221a3/2)s - (\u221a3/4)s = (\u221a3/4)s\n    *  Therefore, the area of triangle DEF is (1/2) * (s/4) * (\u221a3/4)s = (\u221a3/32)s^2\n**4.  The Ratio**\n* The ratio of the area of triangle DEF to the area of triangle ABC is:\n    (\u221a3/32)s^2 / (\u221a3/4)s^2 = 1/8\n**Therefore, the ratio of the area of triangle DEF to the area of triangle ABC is 1:8.** \n",

This creates a 30-60-90 right triangle (triangle BED).\n**2.  Using Properties of 30-60-90 Triangles**\n* **Side Ratios:** In a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio of 1:\u221a3:2.\n* **Applying Ratios:**  Since ED is the shorter leg of triangle BED, and BD is the hypotenuse, we have:\n    * BD = 2 * ED\n**3.  Relating Side Lengths**\n* **Triangle ABC:**  Let the side length of triangle ABC be 's'.\n* **Triangle DEF:**  Since DE is the shorter leg of triangle BED, and BD is half the side length of ABC (s/2), we can find DE:\n    * DE = (s/2) / \u221a3 = s / (2\u221a3)\n* **Triangle DEF:**  The side length of triangle DEF (DF or EF) is twice the length of DE:\n    * DF = EF = 2 * DE = s / \u221a3\n**4.

Finding the Ratio**\n* **Ratio:** (Area of DEF) / (Area of ABC) = [(\u221a3/4) * (s\u00b2/3)] / [(\u221a3/4) * s\u00b2]\n* **Simplifying:** The ratio simplifies to 1/3.\n**Therefore, the ratio of the area of triangle DEF to the area of triangle ABC is 1:3.** \n"
