    "solution": "Let $x$ represent the length of each of the edges. If we draw the diagonal $\\overline{BD}$, we create the right triangle $BCD$. Since $\\overline{BC}\\cong\\overline{DC}$, $\\triangle BCD$ is a 45-45-90 right triangle, which means the hypotenuse has a length of $\\sqrt{2}$ times the length of each leg. So $BD=x\\sqrt{2}$. Since $\\triangle ABD$ is an isosceles triangle, we know that drawing a segment from $A$ to the midpoint of $\\overline{BD}$ splits the triangles into two congruent right triangles. Each right triangle has a hypotenuse of length $x$ and a leg of length $\\frac{BD}{2}=\\frac{x\\sqrt{2}}{2}=\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{2}}$. Notice that the hypotenuse has a length of $\\sqrt{2}$ times the length of the bottom leg, which means the triangle is another 45-45-90 right triangle.

        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Visualize the Pyramid**\nImagine a pyramid with a square base.  Since all edges are the same length, the pyramid is a regular square pyramid.  This means all four triangular faces are congruent isosceles triangles.\n**2.  Focus on Triangle ABD**\n*  Triangle ABD is one of the triangular faces of the pyramid.\n*  Since all edges are the same length, AB = AD = BD.  This makes triangle ABD an equilateral triangle.\n**3.  Angles in an Equilateral Triangle**\n*  All three angles in an equilateral triangle are equal.\n*  The sum of the angles in any triangle is 180 degrees. \n**4.  Solve for Angle ABD**\n*  Let x represent the measure of each angle in triangle ABD.\n*  We have the equation: x + x + x = 180 degrees\n*  Simplifying: 3x = 180 degrees\n*  Solving for x: x = 60 degrees\n**Therefore, the measure of angle ABD is 60 degrees.** \n",

This means the base is a square, and the four triangular faces are all congruent isosceles triangles.\n**2. Focus on Triangle ABD:**\nWe're asked to find the measure of angle ABD. Notice that triangle ABD is an isosceles triangle because AB and AD are both edges of the pyramid and therefore have the same length.\n**3. Draw an Altitude:**\nDraw an altitude from point A to side BD.  Let the point where the altitude intersects BD be point M.  \n[asy]size(100);\nimport three; defaultpen(linewidth(0.7)); currentprojection = orthographic(0.8,-1,0.15);\npen sm = fontsize(8); triple A = (.5,.5,1), B = (0,0,0), C = (1,0,0), D = (1,1,0), E = (0,1,0), M = (B + D)/2; /* should be A = (.5,.5,1/2^.5) */\ndraw(A--B--C--D--A--C); draw(A--E--D,linewidth(0.7)+linetype(\"3 3\")); draw(B--E,linewidth(0.7)+linetype(\"2 2\")); draw(A--M,linewidth(0.7)+linetype(\"4 4\"));\nlabel(\"A\",A,N,sm); label(\"B\",B,S,sm); label(\"C\",C,S,sm);label(\"D\",D,(1,0),sm);label(\"E\",E,NW,sm); label(\"M\",M,S,sm);\n[/asy]\n**4. Properties of Isosceles Triangles:**\n* Since triangle ABD is isosceles, we know that angles BAD and BDA are congruent.\n* The altitude AM bisects angle BAD, so angles BAM and DAM are congruent.\n**5. Right Triangle AMB:**\nTriangle AMB is a right triangle with right angle at M. \n**6. Use Geometry:**\n* Since all edges of the pyramid are the same length, triangle ABD is also a right triangle (angle ADB is a right angle).  This means angle AMD is a right angle as well. \n* Therefore, angles BAM and AMD are complementary angles, meaning their measures add up to 90 degrees.\n**7. Find Angle ABD:**\nSince angles BAD and BDA are congruent, and angle BAM is half of angle BAD, we can find angle ABD as follows:\n* Angle ABD = Angle BAM + Angle MBD\n* Angle ABD = (1/2) * Angle BAD + (1/2) * Angle BDA \n* Angle ABD = (1/2) * (180 degrees - Angle ADB)  (Since angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees)\n* Angle ABD = (1/2) * (180 degrees - 90 degrees)\n* **Angle ABD = 45 degrees**\n**Therefore, the degree measure of angle ABD is 45 degrees.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Geometry**\n* Imagine a right pyramid with a square base.  All edges have the same length, so the pyramid is a regular pyramid.\n* Focus on triangle *ABD*.  We need to find angle *ABD*.\n**2. Key Properties**\n* **Square Base:** Since the base is a square,  angles *ABC*, *BCD*, *CDA*, and *DAB* are all right angles (90 degrees).\n* **Isosceles Triangles:**  Because all edges are equal, triangle *ABD* is isosceles (with *AB* = *AD*).\n**3. Finding the Missing Angle**\n* **Triangle ABD:** We know angle *BAD* is 90 degrees. Since *ABD* and *ADB* are the base angles of an isosceles triangle, they must be equal. \n* **Angle Sum Property:** The angles inside any triangle add up to 180 degrees. Therefore, in triangle *ABD*: \n   * 90 degrees + *ABD* + *ADB* = 180 degrees\n   * 90 degrees + 2 * *ABD* = 180 degrees  (since *ABD* = *ADB*)\n**4. Solving for Angle ABD**\n* **Simplify:**  2 * *ABD* = 90 degrees\n* **Divide:** *ABD* = 45 degrees\n**Answer:** The degree measure of angle *ABD* is **45 degrees**. \n",

Since all edges are equal, triangle $ABD$ will be an equilateral triangle.\n2. **Equilateral Triangle Properties:** An equilateral triangle has three equal angles, and the sum of the angles in any triangle is 180 degrees.  Therefore, each angle in an equilateral triangle measures 180/3 = 60 degrees.\n3. **Angle ABD:** Since triangle $ABD$ is equilateral, angle $ABD$ measures **60 degrees**. \n",

Since all edges are the same length, the base is a square, and the four triangular faces are congruent isosceles triangles.\n**2. Focus on Triangle ABD**\n*  Triangle ABD is one of the isosceles triangles that makes up the pyramid's face.\n*  Since AB and AD are edges of the pyramid, they are equal in length. \n**3. Find the Base Angles**\n* Let's call the base angles of triangle ABD,  \u2220ABD and \u2220ADB. Since the triangle is isosceles,  \u2220ABD = \u2220ADB.\n*  The sum of the angles in any triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore:\n   \u2220ABD + \u2220ADB + \u2220BAD = 180\u00b0\n*  Substituting \u2220ABD for \u2220ADB:\n   \u2220ABD + \u2220ABD + \u2220BAD = 180\u00b0\n   2\u2220ABD + \u2220BAD = 180\u00b0\n**4. Determine \u2220BAD**\n*  Focus on the square base ABCD.  \u2220BAD is one of the angles of the square.  \n*  Since a square has four right angles,  \u2220BAD = 90\u00b0.\n**5. Solve for \u2220ABD**\n*  Substitute \u2220BAD = 90\u00b0 into the equation from step 3:\n   2\u2220ABD + 90\u00b0 = 180\u00b0\n*  Solve for \u2220ABD:\n   2\u2220ABD = 90\u00b0\n   \u2220ABD = 45\u00b0\n**Answer:** The degree measure of angle ABD is **45 degrees**. \n"
