    "solution": "If the measures of these two interior angles are $x$ and $y$, then $\\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{4}{5}$ and therefore $5x=4y$. We also know that $x+y=180$, so therefore $4x+4y=720$, $9x=720$, and $x=80$. Therefore, $y = \\frac{5}{4} \\times 80 = \\boxed{100^\\circ}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand Parallelogram Properties**\n* **Opposite angles are equal.**\n* **Consecutive angles are supplementary** (they add up to 180 degrees).\n**2. Set up the Ratio**\nLet the two interior angles be represented by 4x and 5x.\n**3. Use the Supplementary Angle Property**\nSince consecutive angles in a parallelogram are supplementary:\n* 4x + 5x = 180\n**4. Solve for x**\n* 9x = 180\n* x = 20\n**5. Find the Measures of the Angles**\n* The two angles are 4x = 4(20) = 80 degrees and 5x = 5(20) = 100 degrees.\n**6. Identify the Obtuse Angle**\nSince an obtuse angle is greater than 90 degrees, the obtuse angle in the parallelogram is **100 degrees**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand Parallelogram Properties**\n* **Opposite angles are equal:**  In a parallelogram, opposite angles have the same measure.\n* **Consecutive angles are supplementary:**  Consecutive angles (angles next to each other) add up to 180 degrees.\n**2. Set Up the Ratio**\nSince the ratio of the two interior angles is 4:5, we can represent them as:\n* Angle 1: 4x\n* Angle 2: 5x\n**3. Apply Consecutive Angle Property**\nThe two angles we've represented are consecutive angles, so:\n* 4x + 5x = 180\n**4. Solve for x**\n* 9x = 180\n* x = 20\n**5. Find the Obtuse Angle**\nSince the ratio is 4:5, the obtuse angle (the larger of the two) is represented by 5x.  Substitute x = 20:\n* Obtuse angle = 5 * 20 = 100 degrees\n**Answer:** The degree measure of one of the two obtuse angles of the parallelogram is **100 degrees**. \n",
