    "solution": "Since the measure of angle $BAC$ is 42, the other two equal angles of triangle $ABC$ must be $(180 - 42)/2 = 138/2 = 69$ degrees each. We will introduce the point $F$, which is the center of the circle, and draw segments from each vertex to $F$. Since segment $ED$ is tangent to the circle at point $C$, it must be perpendicular to radius $CF$. Angle $BAC$ is bisected by segment $AF$, so angle $FAC$ is 21 degrees. Angle $FCA$ is also 21 degrees since triangle $AFC$ is isosceles. Thus, the measure of angle $ACD$ is $90 - 21 = \\boxed{69\\text{ degrees}}$, which is the same as the two base angles of triangle ABC.

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Understanding the Diagram:**\n* We have a circle with triangle ABC inscribed inside it. \n*  AC = AB, meaning triangle ABC is isosceles.\n*  Line segment ED is tangent to the circle at point C.\n**2. Key Properties:**\n* **Isosceles Triangle Property:**  In an isosceles triangle, the angles opposite the equal sides are also equal.  Therefore,  \u2220ABC = \u2220ACB.\n* **Angle Sum Property of a Triangle:**  The sum of the interior angles of any triangle is 180 degrees.\n* **Tangent-Radius Property:**  A tangent line to a circle is always perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency.  Therefore, \u2220ACD = 90 degrees.\n**3. Solving for \u2220ABC:**\n* Since \u2220BAC = 42 degrees, and triangle ABC is isosceles, \u2220ABC = \u2220ACB. \n* Applying the angle sum property of a triangle:  42 degrees + \u2220ABC + \u2220ACB = 180 degrees\n*  Combining like terms: 42 degrees + 2 * \u2220ABC = 180 degrees\n* Solving for \u2220ABC: 2 * \u2220ABC = 138 degrees => \u2220ABC = 69 degrees.\n**4. Finding \u2220ACD:**\n* We already know \u2220ACD = 90 degrees (tangent-radius property).\n**Therefore, the measure of angle ACD is 90 degrees.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Understand the Properties**\n* **Inscribed Angle Theorem:**  An inscribed angle's measure is half the measure of its intercepted arc.\n* **Tangent-Radius Property:** A tangent line to a circle is perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency.\n* **Angle Sum of a Triangle:** The angles inside a triangle add up to 180 degrees.\n**2.  Apply the Properties**\n* **Angle ACB:**  Since AC = AB, triangle ABC is isosceles. Therefore, angles ABC and ACB are congruent.  Since angle BAC = 42 degrees, we have: \n   *  angle ABC = angle ACB = (180 - 42) / 2 = 69 degrees.\n* **Angle ACD:**  Line ED is tangent to the circle at point C, so angle ACD is a right angle (90 degrees).\n* **Angle BCD:**  Since angle ACB = 69 degrees and angle ACD = 90 degrees, we have:\n   * angle BCD = 90 - 69 = 21 degrees.\n**3.  Final Answer**\nTherefore, the measure of angle ACD is **90 degrees**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Angles in an Isosceles Triangle:**\n* Since $AC = AB$, triangle $ABC$ is isosceles. \n* The base angles of an isosceles triangle are congruent, so  \u2220ABC = \u2220ACB.\n*  We know \u2220BAC = 42\u00b0.  Since the angles in a triangle sum to 180\u00b0, we have:\n   \u2220ABC + \u2220ACB + \u2220BAC = 180\u00b0\n   \u2220ABC + \u2220ACB = 180\u00b0 - 42\u00b0 = 138\u00b0\n   \u2220ABC = \u2220ACB = 138\u00b0/2 = 69\u00b0\n**2. Tangent-Radius Property:**\n*  A tangent line to a circle is perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency.  \n*  Therefore, \u2220ACD = 90\u00b0.\n**3. Finding  \u2220ACD:**\n* We know \u2220ACB = 69\u00b0 and \u2220ACD = 90\u00b0.\n* Since \u2220ACB and \u2220ACD form a linear pair (they lie on a straight line), they add up to 180\u00b0.\n* Therefore, \u2220ACD = 180\u00b0 - \u2220ACB = 180\u00b0 - 69\u00b0 = **111\u00b0** \n",

Angle Sum of Triangle ABC:**\n* The angles inside any triangle add up to 180 degrees. \n* Therefore, \u2220ABC + \u2220ACB + \u2220BAC = 180\u00b0.\n* We know \u2220BAC = 42\u00b0.  \n* Since \u2220ABC = \u2220ACB, we can let each of them equal  *x*.  \n* This gives us the equation:  *x* + *x* + 42 = 180\n**3. Solving for x:**\n* Combine like terms: 2*x* + 42 = 180\n* Subtract 42 from both sides: 2*x* = 138\n* Divide both sides by 2: *x* = 69\n* So, \u2220ABC = \u2220ACB = 69\u00b0\n**4.

Finding \u2220ACD:**\n* We know \u2220ACB = 69\u00b0.\n* Since \u2220ACD is a right angle, we can find \u2220ACD by subtracting \u2220ACB from 90\u00b0. \n* \u2220ACD = 90\u00b0 - 69\u00b0 = 21\u00b0\n**Answer:** The measure of angle $ACD$ is **21 degrees**. \n",
