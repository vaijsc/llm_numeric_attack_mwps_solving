    "solution": "In the diagram, the radius of the sector is 12 so $OA=OB=12$.  Since the angle of the sector is $60^\\circ$, then the sector is $\\dfrac{60^\\circ}{360^\\circ}=\\dfrac{1}{6}$ of the total circle. Therefore, arc $AB$ is $\\frac{1}{6}$ of the total circumference of a circle of radius 12, so has length $\\frac{1}{6}(2\\pi(12))=4\\pi$. Therefore, the perimeter of the sector is $12+12+4\\pi=\\boxed{24+4\\pi}$.",
