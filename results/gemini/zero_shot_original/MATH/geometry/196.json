The diagonal determined by the two given points has its midpoint at $(0, 0),$ and it has length \\[\\sqrt{(4-(-4))^2 + (3-(-3))^2} = \\sqrt{8^2 + 6^2} = 10.\\]Thus, the other diagonal must have its midpoint at $(0, 0)$ and also have length $10.$ This means that the other two vertices of the rectangle must lie on the circle $x^2 + y^2 = 5^2.$ The number of lattice points (points with integer coordinates) on this circle is $12$: we have \\[(\\pm 4, \\pm 3), (\\pm 3, \\pm 4), (\\pm 5, 0), (0, \\pm 5).\\]These points pair up to give $6$ possible diagonals, of which $1$ is the given diagonal. Therefore, there are $6-1=5$ choices for the other diagonal, which uniquely determines a rectangle. Thus there are $\\boxed{5}$ possible rectangles.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understanding the Setup**\n* We have a rectangle with two opposite vertices given: (4,3) and (-4,-3). \n* These vertices are the endpoints of a diagonal of the rectangle.\n* We need to find the other two vertices, which must have integer coordinates.\n**2.  Finding the Center**\n* The center of the rectangle is the midpoint of the diagonal. The midpoint formula gives us:\n   * Center =  ((4 + (-4))/2, (3 + (-3))/2) = (0,0) \n**3. Using Symmetry**\n* Since the center of the rectangle is (0,0), the other two vertices must be symmetric to the given vertices with respect to the origin. \n* This means we can reflect (4,3) and (-4,-3) across the origin to find the other two vertices.\n* Reflecting across the origin means changing the signs of both coordinates:\n    * The reflection of (4, 3) is (-4, -3).\n    * The reflection of (-4, -3) is (4, 3).\n**4. The Solution**\n* We've found that the other two vertices are already given! This means there is only **one** rectangle that satisfies the given conditions.\n**Therefore, there is only one rectangle that satisfies the given conditions.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Geometry**\n* The given vertices are diagonally opposite corners of the rectangle. \n* Since the rectangle has integer coordinates, the other two vertices must lie on the lines that are parallel to the coordinate axes and pass through the given vertices.\n**2. Find the Equations of the Parallel Lines**\n* **Line through (4,3) parallel to the y-axis:**  This line has the equation  *x = 4*.\n* **Line through (4,3) parallel to the x-axis:** This line has the equation *y = 3*.\n* **Line through (-4,-3) parallel to the y-axis:** This line has the equation *x = -4*.\n* **Line through (-4,-3) parallel to the x-axis:** This line has the equation *y = -3*.\n**3. Find Possible Integer Coordinates**\n*  The other two vertices of the rectangle must lie on the intersection of these lines.  This means the x-coordinate of one vertex will be 4, and the x-coordinate of the other vertex will be -4.  Similarly, the y-coordinate of one vertex will be 3, and the y-coordinate of the other will be -3.\n**4. Count the Rectangles**\nSince we have two choices for the x-coordinate of one vertex and two choices for the y-coordinate of the other vertex, there are a total of 2 * 2 = **4** possible rectangles. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Situation**\nImagine the rectangle on a coordinate plane.  The given points (4,3) and (-4,-3) are diagonally opposite corners of the rectangle.\n**2. Find the Center**\nThe center of the rectangle is the midpoint of the segment connecting the two given points.  The midpoint formula gives us:\n* Center =  ((4 + (-4))/2, (3 + (-3))/2) = (0,0)\n**3. Understand the Implications**\n* Since the center is at the origin (0,0), and the other vertices have integer coordinates, this means the sides of the rectangle must be parallel to the axes. \n* The distance from each given vertex to the center represents half the length or width of the rectangle.\n**4. Calculate Distances**\n* The distance from (4,3) to (0,0) is \u221a(4\u00b2 + 3\u00b2) = 5. \n* This means the rectangle could have a width of 10 (twice the distance) or a height of 10.\n**5. Find Possible Dimensions**\n* **Width = 10:** The other two vertices would be (5,3) and (-5,-3).\n* **Height = 10:** The other two vertices would be (4,8) and (-4,-8).\n**6. Count the Rectangles**\nWe found two possible rectangles satisfying the conditions.\n**Answer:** There are **2** rectangles that satisfy the given conditions. \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem:\n**1. Visualize the Situation**\nPlot the points (4,3) and (-4,-3) on a coordinate plane. Notice that they are diagonally opposite corners of a rectangle.\n**2. Understand the Properties**\n* **Center:** The center of the rectangle is the midpoint of the diagonal connecting (4,3) and (-4,-3). This midpoint is (0,0).\n* **Symmetry:**  Since the center is the origin, the rectangle must be symmetric about both the x-axis and the y-axis.\n**3. Determine Possible Vertices**\n* The other two vertices must lie on the lines that are perpendicular to the diagonal and pass through the origin.\n* These lines have slopes of 1 and -1.\n* Since the other vertices have integer coordinates, they must lie on points where these lines intersect grid lines.\n**4. Count the Possibilities**\n* **Horizontal and Vertical Lines:**  Notice that the horizontal line passing through (4,3) intersects the y-axis at (0,3). Similarly, the vertical line passing through (4,3) intersects the x-axis at (4,0). \n* **Symmetry:** Due to symmetry, the other two vertices must be (-4,0) and (0,-3). \n**Therefore, there is only **one** rectangle that satisfies the given conditions.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Understand the Geometry**\n* The given points (4, 3) and (-4, -3) are diagonally opposite corners of the rectangle.\n* The other two vertices must be on the perpendicular bisector of the line segment connecting these two points. \n**2. Find the Perpendicular Bisector**\n* **Midpoint:** The midpoint of the segment connecting (4, 3) and (-4, -3) is ((4-4)/2, (3-3)/2) = (0, 0).\n* **Slope:** The slope of the line segment connecting the given points is (3 - (-3))/(4 - (-4)) = 3/4. \n* **Perpendicular Slope:** The slope of the perpendicular bisector is the negative reciprocal of 3/4, which is -4/3.\n* **Equation:** Using the point-slope form with the midpoint (0, 0) and the perpendicular slope -4/3, the equation of the perpendicular bisector is:  y = (-4/3)x\n**3. Find Integer Points on the Bisector**\n* Since the other two vertices have integer coordinates, we need to find integer solutions to the equation y = (-4/3)x. \n* To get integer values for y, x must be a multiple of 3.  Similarly, to get integer values for x, y must be a multiple of 4.\n* Let's try a few values for x (multiples of 3):\n    * x = 3: y = -4\n    * x = 6: y = -8\n    * x = -3: y = 4\n    * x = -6: y = 8\n**4. Determine the Rectangles**\nEach of these integer points, along with the original two points, defines a rectangle.  Therefore, there are **4** possible rectangles that satisfy the given conditions. \n"
