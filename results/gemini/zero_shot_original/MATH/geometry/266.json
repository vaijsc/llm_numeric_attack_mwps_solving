        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Problem**\nImagine two circles, one smaller than the other, intersecting. They share a chord (a line segment that connects two points on the circle). The centers of the circles are on opposite sides of this chord.\n**2. Draw a Diagram**\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.4 cm);\npair A, B, O1, O2;\nO1 = (0,0);\nO2 = (16,0);\nA = intersectionpoint(arc(O1,10,0,180),arc(O2,17,0,180));\nB = intersectionpoint(arc(O1,10,0,180),arc(O2,17,180,360));\ndraw(Circle(O1,10));\ndraw(Circle(O2,17));\ndraw(A--B);\ndraw(O1--A);\ndraw(O2--B);\nlabel(\"$O_1$\", O1, SW);\nlabel(\"$O_2$\", O2, SE);\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, N);\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, S);\nlabel(\"$10$\", (O1 + A)/2, W);\nlabel(\"$17$\", (O2 + B)/2, E);\nlabel(\"$8$\", (A + B)/2, S);\n[/asy]\nLet:\n*  *O\u2081* be the center of the smaller circle with radius 10 ft.\n*  *O\u2082* be the center of the larger circle with radius 17 ft.\n*  *A* and *B* be the endpoints of the common chord.\n**3. Apply the Pythagorean Theorem**\n*  Since the chord is perpendicular to the line connecting the centers, we have two right triangles: \u0394O\u2081AB and \u0394O\u2082AB.\n*  The chord is bisected by the line connecting the centers, so AB = 8 ft.\n**4. Calculate the Distances**\n*  In \u0394O\u2081AB, we have: O\u2081A = 10 ft (radius) and AB = 8 ft.  Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we can find O\u2081B:\n    *  O\u2081B\u00b2 = O\u2081A\u00b2 - AB\u00b2 = 10\u00b2 - 8\u00b2 = 36\n    *  O\u2081B = \u221a36 = 6 ft \n*  Similarly, in \u0394O\u2082AB, we have: O\u2082B = 17 ft (radius) and AB = 8 ft. Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we can find O\u2082A:\n    *  O\u2082A\u00b2 = O\u2082B\u00b2 - AB\u00b2 = 17\u00b2 - 8\u00b2 = 225\n    *  O\u2082A = \u221a225 = 15 ft\n**5. Find the Distance Between the Centers**\nThe distance between the centers of the circles is O\u2081O\u2082 = O\u2081B + O\u2082A = 6 ft + 15 ft = **21 ft**\n**Therefore, the distance between the centers of the circles is 21 feet.** \n",

Draw a Diagram**\nDraw a diagram to represent the situation. \n* Draw the two circles.\n* Draw the common chord connecting the points of intersection.\n* Connect the center of each circle to the endpoints of the chord.  This will form two right triangles.\n**3.  Use the Pythagorean Theorem**\n* **Label:** Let 'x' be half the length of the chord (so x = 8 ft).\n* **Right Triangle 1:** One right triangle has a hypotenuse of 10 ft (radius of the smaller circle) and one leg of 8 ft (half the chord length). \n* **Right Triangle 2:** The other right triangle has a hypotenuse of 17 ft (radius of the larger circle) and also one leg of 8 ft.\n**4. Apply the Pythagorean Theorem**\n* **Right Triangle 1:**  Let the other leg be 'a'.  Then,  a\u00b2 + 8\u00b2 = 10\u00b2  =>  a\u00b2 = 36  => a = 6 ft\n* **Right Triangle 2:** Let the other leg be 'b'. Then, b\u00b2 + 8\u00b2 = 17\u00b2  =>  b\u00b2 = 225  => b = 15 ft\n**5.

Label the centers of the circles as O and P, and the endpoints of the chord as A and B.\n**2. Use the Pythagorean Theorem**\n* Since the chord is perpendicular to the line segment connecting the centers (OP), we can use the Pythagorean Theorem on right triangles OAB and PAB.\n* Let's focus on triangle OAB.  The radius OA is 10 ft, and half of the chord AB is 8 ft (since the chord is 16 ft long). \n**3.
