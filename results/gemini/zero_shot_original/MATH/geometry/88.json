        "1. **Identify the base and height:**\n   - The base of the triangle is BC, which has length 12.\n   - The height of the triangle is the perpendicular distance from point A to line BC. Since A is directly above B, this height is simply the y-coordinate of point A, which is 9.\n2. **Apply the area formula:**\n   - The area of a triangle is given by (1/2) * base * height.\n   - In this case, the area is (1/2) * 12 * 9 = 54.\n**Therefore, the area of triangle ABC is 54 square units.** \n",
