    "problem": "A right square pyramid has a base with edges each measuring 3 cm and a height twice the perimeter of its base. What is the volume of the pyramid?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The perimeter of the base is $4\\cdot 3 = 12$ cm, so the height of the pyramid is $2\\cdot 12 = 24$ cm.  The base has area $3^2 = 9$ square cm.  The volume of the pyramid is one-third the product of the area of the base and the altitude, which is $9\\cdot 24/3=\\boxed{72}$ cubic cm.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Calculate the perimeter of the base:**\n* The base is a square with sides of 3 cm.\n* Perimeter = 4 * side = 4 * 3 cm = 12 cm\n**2. Calculate the height of the pyramid:**\n* The height is twice the perimeter of the base.\n* Height = 2 * 12 cm = 24 cm\n**3. Calculate the volume of the pyramid:**\n* The volume of a pyramid is (1/3) * (area of the base) * (height)\n* Area of the base = side * side = 3 cm * 3 cm = 9 cm\u00b2\n* Volume = (1/3) * 9 cm\u00b2 * 24 cm = 72 cm\u00b3\n**Therefore, the volume of the pyramid is 72 cubic centimeters.** \n",
