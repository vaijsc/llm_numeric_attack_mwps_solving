        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualizing the Problem**\nImagine a line segment AB of length 1.  We want to find the area covered by all circles of radius 1 that touch this line segment.\n**2. Finding the Boundary of S**\n* **Circles at the endpoints:** Consider the circles centered at A and B.  These circles clearly belong to S.\n* **Circles tangent to both A and B:**  Imagine a circle that's tangent to both A and B. The center of this circle must lie on the perpendicular bisector of AB.  The distance from the center of this circle to either A or B is 1 (the radius).\n* **The limiting case:** As the center of the circle moves further along the perpendicular bisector, the circle gets larger. Eventually, the circle becomes so large that it no longer touches AB. This limiting case occurs when the circle passes through both A and B.\n**3. Finding the Area of S**\n* **Shape of S:** The region S is bounded by two semicircles (from the circles centered at A and B) and two arcs (from the limiting circles that pass through A and B).\n* **Area of semicircles:** Each semicircle has radius 1, so each has area (1/2)\u03c0(1\u00b2) = \u03c0/2.  The two semicircles together have area \u03c0.\n* **Area of the arcs:**  The limiting circles have diameter AB, which is 1.  So, their radius is 1/2. The arcs are each one-quarter of the circumference of these circles, so each arc has length (1/4)(2\u03c0)(1/2) = \u03c0/4. The area enclosed by these arcs is a bit trickier.  Imagine drawing a line from the center of the limiting circle to the point where the arc touches AB. This line, along with the two radii of the circle, forms a 30-60-90 right triangle.  The hypotenuse of this triangle is 1/2, the short leg is 1/4, and the long leg is (\u221a3)/4.  The area of the sector formed by the arc is (1/4)(\u03c0)(1/2)\u00b2 = \u03c0/16.  The area of the triangle is (1/2)(1/4)(\u221a3)/4 = (\u221a3)/32.  The area enclosed by the arc is the difference between the sector and the triangle, which is \u03c0/16 - (\u221a3)/32.  The two arcs together enclose an area of (\u03c0/8) - (\u221a3)/16.\n**4. Total Area**\nThe total area of S is the sum of the areas of the semicircles and the arcs:\nArea of S = \u03c0 + (\u03c0/8) - (\u221a3)/16 = **(9\u03c0/8) - (\u221a3)/16** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Visualize the Situation**\nImagine a line segment AB of length 1.  Now, consider all the circles of radius 1 that can be drawn so that they completely cover this line segment.  The region formed by the union of all these circles is what we're trying to find the area of.\n**2.  Key Observation**\nNotice that the circles will overlap significantly. The most important circles are the ones that are centered at points A and B.  These two circles cover the entire line segment AB and a large portion of the area we need.  Any other circle will be contained within these two circles.\n**3.  Finding the Area**\n* **Area of the Two Large Circles:**  Each of these circles has a radius of 1, so their area is $\\pi (1^2) = \\pi$.  The total area of the two circles is $2\\pi$.\n* **The Overlap:**  The overlap between the two circles is a lens-shaped region.  To find its area, we can think of it as two segments of the circle. Each segment is a portion of the circle cut off by a chord of length 1 (the line segment AB).\n* **Finding the Area of the Segment:**  The angle of the segment can be found using the Law of Cosines:  \n   *  Let O be the center of one of the circles.  Triangle ABO is isosceles with AB = 1 and AO = BO = 1. \n   *  By the Law of Cosines,  $1^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 - 2(1)(1)\\cos \\theta$ \n   *  Solving for $\\theta$, we get $\\cos \\theta = \\frac{1}{2}$, so $\\theta = 60^\\circ$.\n* **Area of the Segment:** The area of a segment is  \n   *  (Area of sector) - (Area of triangle) \n   *  The sector has central angle 60\u00b0 (or $\\frac{\\pi}{3}$ radians) and radius 1, so its area is  $\\frac{1}{6} \\pi (1^2) = \\frac{\\pi}{6}$.\n   *  The triangle is equilateral with side length 1, so its area is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}$.\n   *  The area of the segment is $\\frac{\\pi}{6} - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}$.\n* **Total Overlap:** The total overlap is twice the area of a single segment:  $2\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{6} - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\right) = \\frac{\\pi}{3} - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\n**4. The Final Area**\nThe area of S is the area of the two large circles minus the area of the overlap:\n$S = 2\\pi - \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3} - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) = \\boxed{\\frac{5\\pi}{3} + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}}$ \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step by step:\n**1. Visualize the Problem**\nImagine a line segment AB of length 1.  We're trying to find the area of the region formed by all circles of radius 1 that completely cover this line segment.\n**2. Key Insight**\nThe key insight is that the circles with centers furthest from the line segment AB will be the ones that determine the shape of the region S.\n**3. Finding the Limiting Circles**\n* **Center:** Imagine a circle centered at a point C that lies on the perpendicular bisector of AB (let's call this perpendicular bisector line \"l\"). This circle will just touch the endpoints A and B.\n* **Distance from the Line:** Since the circle has radius 1, the distance from the center C to line l will be 1/2 (half the length of AB).\n**4. Shape of S**\n* The circles centered further away from line l than C will not touch the segment AB.\n* The circles centered on line l with radius 1 will create a \"semicircle\" shape above and below AB.\n* The entire shape of S will be a rectangle with a semicircle on each end.\n**5. Calculate the Area**\n* **Rectangle:** The rectangle's dimensions are 1 (length of AB) by 1 (distance from the center C to AB). So the rectangle's area is 1*1 = 1.\n* **Semicircles:** Each semicircle has radius 1, so the area of a full circle is \u03c0(1)\u00b2 = \u03c0. The semicircle's area is \u03c0/2.\n* **Total Area:**  The total area of S is the area of the rectangle plus the area of the two semicircles: 1 + \u03c0/2 + \u03c0/2 = **1 + \u03c0**.\n**Therefore, the area of S is 1 + \u03c0.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Situation**\nImagine a line segment AB of length 1.  We're going to place circles of radius 1 around this segment.  The key is to realize that we can cover the segment with circles that are tangent to the segment at points A and B, and whose centers are on the perpendicular bisector of AB.\n**2.  The Perpendicular Bisector**\nDraw the perpendicular bisector of AB. This line divides the plane into two halves, and any circle whose center is on this bisector and has radius 1 will cover the segment AB.\n**3.  The Limiting Case**\nThe most extreme circles are those that just barely cover the segment.  These circles will touch points A and B at their edges.  Let's focus on one of these limiting circles.\n**4.  Form a Right Triangle**\nConnect the center of the limiting circle (call it O) to points A and B. You now have a right triangle with:\n*  Hypotenuse: OA (or OB) = radius of the circle = 1\n*  Leg: AB = 1\n*  Leg: AO (or BO) = distance from the center of the circle to the midpoint of AB.\n**5.  Use the Pythagorean Theorem**\nBy the Pythagorean theorem, the distance from the center of the limiting circle to the midpoint of AB is:\n```\n(AO)^2 = (OA)^2 - (AB)^2 = 1^2 - (1/2)^2 = 3/4\n```\nTherefore, AO = BO = \u221a(3/4) = \u221a3 / 2.\n**6.  The Area of S**\nThe region S is formed by all the circles with centers on the perpendicular bisector of AB, from the limiting circles inward.  This forms a semi-circle.\n*  The radius of this semi-circle is OA + (length of the perpendicular bisector) = (\u221a3 / 2) + (1/2) = (\u221a3 + 1)/2\n*  The area of the entire circle would be \u03c0[(\u221a3 + 1)/2]^2 \n*  The area of S is half of this, so:\n**Area of S = (1/2)\u03c0[(\u221a3 + 1)/2]^2 = \u03c0(3 + 2\u221a3 + 1)/8 = \u03c0(4 + 2\u221a3)/8 = \u03c0(2 + \u221a3)/4**\n**Therefore, the area of S is (2 + \u221a3)\u03c0/4.** \n",
        "Here's a step-by-step solution to find the area of S:\n**1. Visualizing the Problem**\nImagine a line segment AB of length 1. Now, consider all possible circles of radius 1 that completely cover this segment.  These circles will overlap, and the region where they overlap will form the shape we're interested in.\n**2. Key Insight**\nThe key is to realize that the region *S* is formed by the union of two semi-circles. Here's why:\n* **Circle with Center A:**  A circle with center A and radius 1 will cover the entire segment AB. The portion of this circle above the line AB forms a semi-circle.\n* **Circle with Center B:**  Similarly, a circle with center B and radius 1 will also cover the entire segment AB. The portion of this circle above the line AB forms another semi-circle.\n**3. Calculating the Area**\n* **Area of a semi-circle:** The area of a full circle is \u03c0r\u00b2, so the area of a semi-circle is (1/2)\u03c0r\u00b2.\n* **Area of S:** Since S is formed by two semi-circles of radius 1, its area is 2 * (1/2)\u03c0(1\u00b2) = **\u03c0**.\n**Therefore, the area of S is \u03c0.** \n"
