Use Similar Triangles**\n* **Triangles $CIA$ and $CED$ are similar:**  Both triangles share angle $C$, and they both have a right angle (at $A$ and $E$, respectively). \n**4.

It's essential to have a visual representation to help you understand the problem.\n**2.  Identify Key Relationships**\n* **Right Triangles:**  Notice that triangle $ACE$ is a right triangle, with right angle at $A$.\n* **Radius and Tangent:**  Line segment $CE$ is tangent to the semicircle. This means that $\\overline{CE}$ is perpendicular to the radius drawn from the center of the semicircle to point $E$. \n* **Symmetry:** Since $ABCD$ is a square, the center of the semicircle (which is the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$) is the same as the center of the square. \n**3.

        "Here's a step-by-step solution:\n**1.  Draw a Diagram**\nIf you haven't already, draw a diagram. It helps to visualize the problem.\n**2.  Identify Key Relationships**\n* **Right Triangles:**  Triangle $ACE$ is a right triangle (since the tangent line is perpendicular to the radius).\n* **Similar Triangles:**  Triangle $ACE$ is similar to triangle $ABE$ (since they share angle $A$ and both have a right angle). \n* **Special Right Triangles:** Triangle $ABE$ is a 45-45-90 triangle (because $AB$ is the diameter of the semicircle).\n**3.  Use the Properties of Similar Triangles**\n* **Ratio of Sides:** Since the triangles are similar, the ratio of corresponding sides is equal.  Let $AE = x$.  Then $BE = x$ (because triangle $ABE$ is 45-45-90) and $AB = x\\sqrt{2}$ (using the properties of 45-45-90 triangles).\n* **Side Lengths:**  We know $AB = 2$ (the side length of the square).  Therefore, $x\\sqrt{2} = 2$, and $x = \\sqrt{2}$.\n**4.  Find CE**\n* **Pythagorean Theorem:** In right triangle $ACE$, we have $AC = 2\\sqrt{2}$ (the diagonal of the square), $AE = \\sqrt{2}$.  Applying the Pythagorean Theorem: \n   $$CE^2 = AC^2 - AE^2 = (2\\sqrt{2})^2 - (\\sqrt{2})^2 = 8 - 2 = 6$$\n* **Solve for CE:**  Therefore, $CE = \\sqrt{6}$.\n**Answer:** The length of $\\overline{CE}$ is $\\boxed{\\sqrt{6}}$. \n",
        "Here's a step-by-step solution to find the length of $\\overline{CE}$:\n**1. Visualize and label:**\n* Draw a diagram as shown in the problem statement.\n* Label the center of the semicircle as point $O$.\n* Since the semicircle has diameter $\\overline{AB}$, its radius is 1.\n**2. Use similar triangles:**\n* Notice that $\\triangle CEO$ and $\\triangle AOB$ are similar triangles. This is because:\n    *  $\\angle CEO = \\angle AOB$ (both are right angles)\n    * $\\angle OCE = \\angle OBA$ (they are both angles that are half the measure of $\\angle AOB$, which is a central angle of the semicircle)\n* Since the triangles are similar, their corresponding sides are proportional.\n**3. Set up a proportion:**\n* We know $AO = BO = 1$ (radius of the semicircle).\n* We also know $AB = 2$ (side of the square).\n* Let $CE = x$.\nNow we can set up the proportion:\n$\\frac{CE}{CO} = \\frac{AB}{AO}$\nSubstitute the known values:\n$\\frac{x}{x+1} = \\frac{2}{1}$\n**4. Solve for x:**\n* Cross-multiply to get: $x = 2(x+1)$\n* Simplify: $x = 2x + 2$\n* Solve for $x$: $x = -2$\n**5. Interpret the result:**\nWe get a negative value for $x$, which means there's an error in our setup.  The issue is that we assumed $CO = x + 1$. However, $CO$ is the hypotenuse of right triangle $CEO$, and since $CE$ is the side opposite the right angle, $CO$ must be longer than $CE$. \nLet's correct our setup. Let $CO = x + y$, where $y$ is some positive value.  Now we have:\n$\\frac{x}{x+y} = \\frac{2}{1}$\nCross-multiplying and simplifying gives:\n$x = 2x + 2y$\nThis simplifies to:\n$x = -2y$\nSince $y$ is positive, this means $x$ must be negative. This means there's a flaw in our original assumption that a tangent from $C$ intersects $\\overline{AD}$. \n**Conclusion:** There is no point $E$ where a tangent from $C$ intersects $\\overline{AD}$. The tangent line from $C$ will actually intersect $\\overline{AD}$ extended beyond point $D$.  \n**Therefore, the length of $\\overline{CE}$ is undefined in this scenario.** \n"
