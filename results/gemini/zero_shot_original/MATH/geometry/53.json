Because the square was rotated $45^\\circ,$ each circular sector (shown in gray) has a central angle of $45^\\circ$ and a radius of $AO = \\tfrac{\\sqrt2}{2}.$ Therefore, put together, they form a semicircle of radius $\\tfrac{\\sqrt2}{2},$ which has area \\[\\frac12 \\pi \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt2}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{\\pi}{4}.\\]The four larger triangles (shown in blue) have area equal to half the area of the original square, so they contribute $\\tfrac12$ to the overall area. Finally, each of the smaller triangles (shown unshaded) has legs of length $AB = AO - BO = \\tfrac{\\sqrt2}{2} - \\tfrac{1}{2},$ so their total area is \\[4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt2}{2} - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{3-2\\sqrt2}{2}.\\]Thus, the area of the entire given region is \\[\\frac \\pi 4 + \\frac12 + \\frac{3-2\\sqrt2}{2} = \\boxed{\\frac \\pi4 + 2 - \\sqrt2}.\\]",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Rotation**\nImagine a unit square centered at the origin.  When you rotate it 45 degrees, it will trace out a shape that looks like a \"curved\" square, or a square with rounded corners.\n**2. Break Down the Shape**\nThis shape can be broken down into four congruent pieces:\n* **The original square:** This is the square before any rotation.\n* **Four congruent quarter-circles:**  Each corner of the rotated shape is a quarter-circle. The radius of each quarter-circle is equal to the side length of the original square, which is 1.\n**3. Calculate the Area**\n* **Area of the original square:**  Side length * side length = 1 * 1 = 1\n* **Area of one quarter-circle:** (1/4) * \u03c0 * (radius)^2 = (1/4) * \u03c0 * (1)^2 = \u03c0/4\n* **Area of all four quarter-circles:** 4 * (\u03c0/4) = \u03c0\n**4.  The Total Area**\nThe area of the region swept out is the area of the original square plus the area of the four quarter-circles:\nTotal area = 1 + \u03c0 = **1 + \u03c0** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Rotation:**\nImagine a unit square (side length 1) centered at the origin. When you rotate it 45 degrees, it will \"sweep out\" a shape that looks like a pie slice.\n**2. Identify the Shape:**\nThe shape swept out is actually a sector of a circle. The radius of this circle is the diagonal of the square, which has length $\\sqrt{2}$.\n**3. Find the Area of the Sector:**\n* **Area of a sector:**  (angle/360\u00b0) * \u03c0 * radius\u00b2\n* **Angle:** 45\u00b0\n* **Radius:** \u221a2\nTherefore, the area of the sector is (45\u00b0/360\u00b0) * \u03c0 * (\u221a2)\u00b2 = (1/8) * \u03c0 * 2 = **\u03c0/4**.\n**4. The Answer:**\nThe area of the region swept out by the interior of the square is **\u03c0/4 square units**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Visualize the Rotation:**\nImagine a unit square. When you rotate it 45 degrees about its center, the square essentially \"sweeps out\" a portion of a larger circle. This circle has a radius equal to the diagonal of the square.\n**2. Calculate the Diagonal:**\nThe diagonal of a unit square (with side length 1) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:\n*  diagonal\u00b2 = side\u00b2 + side\u00b2 = 1\u00b2 + 1\u00b2 = 2\n*  diagonal = \u221a2\n**3. Calculate the Area of the Circle:**\nThe area of a circle is given by \u03c0r\u00b2, where r is the radius.  Since the radius of our circle is the diagonal of the square (\u221a2):\n* Area of circle = \u03c0(\u221a2)\u00b2 = 2\u03c0\n**4.  Determine the Fraction of the Circle:**\nThe 45-degree rotation represents 1/8th of a full circle (360 degrees). Therefore, the area swept out by the square is 1/8th of the circle's area.\n**5. Calculate the Area Swept Out:**\nArea swept out = (1/8) * Area of circle = (1/8) * 2\u03c0 = **\u03c0/4**\n**Answer:** The area of the region swept out by the interior of the square is **\u03c0/4 square units**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step by step:\n**1. Visualize the Rotation**\nImagine a unit square. When you rotate it 45 degrees about its center, it will trace out a portion of a larger square.\n**2.  Find the Dimensions of the Larger Square**\n* **Diagonals:**  The diagonals of the original square become the sides of the larger square.\n* **Pythagorean Theorem:**  Since the original square has side length 1, the diagonal (and side of the larger square) has length $\\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{2}$.\n**3. Calculate the Area of the Larger Square**\nThe area of the larger square is $(\\sqrt{2})^2 = 2$.\n**4. Determine the Fraction of the Larger Square Covered**\nThe rotated square sweeps out 45 degrees out of a full 360 degrees.  This is a fraction of $\\frac{45}{360} = \\frac{1}{8}$ of the larger square.\n**5. Calculate the Area Swept Out**\nThe area swept out by the original square is $\\frac{1}{8}$ of the larger square's area:  $\\frac{1}{8} \\cdot 2 = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Rotation**\nImagine a unit square (sides of length 1) centered at the origin of a coordinate plane. When you rotate it 45 degrees, you'll get a shape that looks like a diamond or a rotated square.\n**2.  Understanding the Shape**\n* **Vertices:** The original square's vertices will trace out arcs of circles as they rotate.  Each arc will be a quarter of a circle with radius 1/\u221a2 (the distance from the center of the square to a vertex).\n* **Area:** The area swept out will consist of four of these quarter-circle sectors plus four small triangles formed at the corners.\n**3.  Calculating the Area**\n* **Quarter-Circle Sectors:** Each sector has an area of (1/4)\u03c0r\u00b2, where r = 1/\u221a2. So, the total area of the four sectors is 4 * (1/4)\u03c0(1/\u221a2)\u00b2 = \u03c0/2.\n* **Triangles:** Each small triangle is a right triangle with legs of length 1/\u221a2. The area of each triangle is (1/2)(1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) = 1/4.  There are four of these, so their total area is 1.\n**4.  Final Area**\nThe total area swept out is the sum of the sector areas and the triangle areas: \u03c0/2 + 1 = **(\u03c0 + 2)/2**. \n"
