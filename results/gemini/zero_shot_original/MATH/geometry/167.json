        "Here's how to compute sin 30\u00b0:\n**1. Visualize the Unit Circle:**\n* Imagine a circle with radius 1 centered at the origin of a coordinate plane.\n* The angle 30\u00b0 is measured counterclockwise from the positive x-axis.\n**2. Find the Point on the Unit Circle:**\n* A 30-60-90 right triangle is formed where the hypotenuse is the radius of the unit circle (length 1).\n* The side opposite the 30\u00b0 angle has length 1/2. \n* The side adjacent to the 30\u00b0 angle has length \u221a3/2.\n**3. Recall Sine's Definition:**\n* In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the hypotenuse.\n**4. Calculate sin 30\u00b0:**\n* Opposite side: 1/2\n* Hypotenuse: 1\n* Therefore, sin 30\u00b0 = (1/2) / 1 = **1/2** \n",
        "Here's how to compute $\\sin 30^\\circ$:\n**1. Visualize the Unit Circle:**\n* Imagine a circle with radius 1 centered at the origin of a coordinate plane.\n*  An angle of $30^\\circ$ starts from the positive x-axis and rotates counterclockwise.\n**2.  Construct a 30-60-90 Triangle:**\n*  Draw a line segment from the origin to a point on the unit circle where the angle intersects the circle.\n*  This line segment is the hypotenuse of a right triangle.\n*  Draw a vertical line down from the point on the circle to the x-axis. This forms a 30-60-90 right triangle.\n**3.  Use the Ratios in a 30-60-90 Triangle:**\n* The sides of a 30-60-90 triangle have specific ratios: \n    * The hypotenuse is twice the length of the shorter leg.\n    * The longer leg is \u221a3 times the length of the shorter leg.\n* Since the hypotenuse of our triangle is 1 (the radius of the unit circle), the shorter leg has a length of 1/2.\n**4.  Relate to Sine:**\n* Remember, sine is the ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse.\n* In our triangle, the opposite side (the shorter leg) is 1/2, and the hypotenuse is 1.\n**Therefore, sin 30\u00b0 = (opposite side) / (hypotenuse) = (1/2) / (1) = 1/2.** \n",

Recall the 30-60-90 Triangle:**\n*  The 30\u00b0 angle creates a special 30-60-90 right triangle within the circle.\n* In this triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1 : \u221a3 : 2. \n* The hypotenuse is 2 (the radius of the unit circle), the shorter leg is 1, and the longer leg is \u221a3.\n**5. Determine the Sine:**\n* Sine is the y-coordinate of the point on the unit circle.\n*  Since the shorter leg of the triangle is the y-coordinate, sin 30\u00b0 = **1/2**. \n",
