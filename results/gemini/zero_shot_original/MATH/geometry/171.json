    "solution": "For this problem we must remember the Triangle Inequality Theorem that states that the shortest side must be longer than the positive difference of the other two sides. We will try to make a long skinny triangle with side $AB$ as short as possible. First we try making $AB$ equal to 1 unit.  Then the other two sides must have a difference less than 1 unit in order to form a triangle. The closest we can come with integers is 191 and 192, but that won't work. The shorter sides will lay flat on the longest side and will fail to make a triangle. Next we try making AB equal to 2 units. If the  other two sides were 191 each, we would have a triangle, but all three sides would not have different lengths. If the other two sides were 190 and 192, we wouldn't have a triangle. Finally, we try making $AB$ equal to 3 units. Then the other two sides could be 190 and 191 units, and we can now form a  triangle. The greatest possible difference is therefore $191 - 3 = \\boxed{188\\text{ units}}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step by step:\n**1. Understand the Triangle Inequality**\nThe Triangle Inequality states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side.\n**2. Apply the Inequality to the Problem**\n* Since AC is the longest side, we know:  AB + BC > AC\n* Since AB is the shortest side, we know: AC + BC > AB\n**3. Maximize the Difference**\nTo maximize AC - AB, we want to make AB as small as possible and AC as large as possible.  Let's try to minimize AB.\n* Since the perimeter is 384, we have: AB + AC + BC = 384.\n* To minimize AB, let's try to make BC as large as possible.\n**4. Finding the Maximum BC**\n* If BC is almost as big as AB + AC, we're getting close to violating the Triangle Inequality. \n* The largest possible BC is slightly less than (AB + AC). Since we want integer side lengths, the largest possible BC is one less than (AB + AC).\n**5. Setting Up an Equation**\n* Let's say AB = x and BC = 384 - x - AC.  Since BC is one less than (AB + AC), we have:\n   384 - x - AC = (x + AC) - 1 \n* Simplifying, we get: 385 - 2x - AC = AC\n* Combining like terms: 385 - 2x = 2AC\n**6. Finding the Maximum AC**\n* To maximize AC, we need to minimize 2x.  Since x is an integer, the smallest possible value for 2x is 2. \n* Plugging this into our equation: 385 - 2 = 2AC \n* Simplifying: 383 = 2AC\n* Therefore, AC = 383/2 \n**7. Finding the Maximum Difference**\n* AC - AB = (383/2) - x\n* Since 2x = 2, x = 1\n* Therefore, the greatest possible difference AC - AB is (383/2) - 1 = **190.5** \n**However, since side lengths must be integers, we need to adjust:**\n* The closest integer value to 190.5 is **190**. \n**Therefore, the greatest possible difference AC - AB is 190.** \n",

Understanding the Triangle Inequality**\nThe Triangle Inequality states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side.\n**2. Setting up the Variables**\n* Let  *a* = length of side *AB* (shortest side)\n* Let *b* = length of side *BC*\n* Let *c* = length of side *AC* (longest side)\nWe know that *a* < *b* < *c* and *a + b + c = 384*.\n**3. Maximizing the Difference (c - a)**\nTo maximize *c - a*, we want to make *c* as large as possible and *a* as small as possible.  \n**4. Applying the Triangle Inequality**\n* **c < a + b:**  Since *c* is the longest side, it must be less than the sum of the other two sides.\n* **b < c - a:**  Since *b* is the middle side, it must be less than the difference between the longest and shortest sides.\n**5. Finding the Smallest Possible Value for *a***\nTo make *c - a* as large as possible, we want *a* to be as small as possible.  Let's try to minimize *a* by using the Triangle Inequality:\n* **c < a + b:**  Substitute *c = 384 - a - b* into this inequality:\n   * 384 - a - b < a + b\n   * 384 < 2a + 2b\n   * 192 < a + b\nSince *a* and *b* are integers, the smallest possible value for *a* that satisfies this inequality is *a = 1*.  \n**6. Finding the Largest Possible Value for *c***\nNow, let's maximize *c* using the other Triangle Inequality:\n* **b < c - a:**  We know *a = 1*.  To maximize *c*, we want *b* to be as small as possible.  Since *a = 1* and *a < b*, the smallest possible value for *b* is *b = 2*.\nSubstituting these values back into the perimeter equation:\n* 1 + 2 + *c* = 384\n* *c* = 381\n**7. Calculating the Difference**\n* *c - a* = 381 - 1 = 380\n**Answer:** The greatest possible difference *AC - AB* is **380**. \n",

Apply the Triangle Inequality:**\n* **To minimize AB:** Since $AB$ is the shortest side, we want to make it as close to 1 as possible. However, the Triangle Inequality requires that $AB + BC > AC$. To satisfy this with $AB$ close to 1, we need to make $BC$ close to $AC$. \n* **To maximize AC:**  Let's assume $AB$ is very close to 1. To make $AC$ as large as possible, we should make $BC$ slightly larger than $AB$.\n**4.  Finding a Solution:**\nLet's try to find a solution where $AB$ is close to 1 and $BC$ is slightly larger than $AB$.  We can start by considering $AB = 1$ and $BC = 2$. This would give us:\n* $AC = 384 - AB - BC = 384 - 1 - 2 = 381$\nHowever, this doesn't satisfy the Triangle Inequality. We need $AB + BC > AC$.  Let's increase $BC$ slightly. \nIf we try $AB = 1$ and $BC = 3$, we get:\n* $AC = 384 - AB - BC = 384 - 1 - 3 = 380$\nThis still doesn't satisfy the Triangle Inequality.
