        "Here's a step-by-step solution to find the ratio of the smallest to largest area:\n**1. Divide the Hexagon into Triangles:**\n* Draw all the diagonals of the hexagon, as shown in the diagram.\n* Notice that the diagonals divide the hexagon into smaller triangles.  \n**2. Identify the Smallest and Largest Triangles:**\n* **Smallest Triangle:** The smallest triangle is formed by the points (0,0), (1,0), and (1,1). This is a right triangle with legs of length 1.\n* **Largest Triangle:** The largest triangle is formed by the points (1,1), (1,2), and (2,2).  This is also a right triangle, but with legs of length 1 and 2.\n**3. Calculate the Areas:**\n* **Smallest Triangle:**  Area = (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 1 * 1 = 1/2\n* **Largest Triangle:** Area = (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 1 * 2 = 1\n**4. Find the Ratio:**\n* The ratio of the smallest area to the largest area is (1/2) : 1.\n**5. Simplify the Ratio:**\n* Multiply both sides of the ratio by 2 to get the simplified ratio:  **1 : 2**\n**Therefore, the ratio a:b is 1:2.** \n",
        "Let's analyze the diagram to find the smallest and largest regions.\n**Smallest Region:**\n* The smallest region is likely to be one of the triangular regions formed by the diagonals.  \n* Consider the triangle formed by connecting points  `a`, `h`, and `i`. \n* This triangle has base `ah` and height `hi`. Since `ah` is half the length of a side of the hexagon, and `hi` is one-third the length of a side, the area of this triangle is (1/2)(1/2)(1/3) = 1/12 of the area of the hexagon.\n**Largest Region:**\n* The largest region is likely to be the central pentagon formed by connecting points `g`, `r`, `q`, `p`, and `o`.\n* This pentagon can be decomposed into a rectangle and a right triangle. The rectangle has sides of length `gr` and `rp`, both of which are one-third the length of a side of the hexagon. The right triangle has legs `gp` and `po`, each of which is two-thirds the length of a side of the hexagon. \n* The area of the pentagon is then (1/3)(1/3) + (1/2)(2/3)(2/3) = 1/9 + 2/9 = 1/3 of the area of the hexagon.\n**Ratio:**\nSince the smallest region has area 1/12 of the hexagon and the largest region has area 1/3 of the hexagon, the ratio of their areas is (1/12) : (1/3) = **1:4**. \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem step by step:\n**1. Finding the Smallest Region:**\n* **Focus on Triangles:** The smallest regions are likely to be triangles. \n* **Identify Small Triangles:** Look for triangles formed by diagonals where two sides are relatively short.\n* **The Smallest Triangle:**  The triangle formed by the points $(0,0)$, $(1,1)$, and  $(0,1)$  appears to be the smallest.\n**2. Finding the Largest Region:**\n* **Focus on Quadrilaterals:** The largest region is likely to be a quadrilateral.\n* **Identify Large Quadrilaterals:** Look for quadrilaterals with sides formed by diagonals that are relatively long. \n* **The Largest Quadrilateral:** The quadrilateral formed by the points $(1,1)$, $(2,1)$, $(2,2)$, and $(1,2)$ appears to be the largest.\n**3. Calculating Areas:**\n* **Area of the Smallest Triangle:** \n    * Base: 1 unit \n    * Height: 1 unit\n    * Area: (1/2) * 1 * 1 = 1/2\n    * So,  a = 1/2\n* **Area of the Largest Quadrilateral:**\n    * It's a square with side length 1.\n    * Area: 1 * 1 = 1\n    * So, b = 1\n**4. The Ratio:**\n* The ratio a:b is (1/2):1 \n* Simplifying, we get the ratio in lowest terms: **1:2** \n",
        "Here's a step-by-step solution to find the ratio of the smallest to the largest region areas:\n**1.  Understanding the Structure**\n* The hexagon is divided into 24 regions by its diagonals.  Notice the symmetry in the design:  all the regions within the hexagon are congruent to their counterparts outside.  So, we only need to focus on one half of the hexagon.\n* The central point, where all the diagonals intersect, is the point of symmetry.\n**2.  Identifying Key Shapes**\n* **Smallest Region:** The smallest region is a triangle formed by a vertex of the hexagon and two points on the diagonals that intersect at the central point. \n* **Largest Region:**  The largest region is a quadrilateral formed by one side of the hexagon, two points on the diagonals, and the central point.\n**3.  Analyzing Areas**\n* **Smallest Region:** Let's consider the smallest region at the bottom left. Its base is half the length of a side of the hexagon (1/2 unit), and its height is the distance from the central point to the base of the hexagon.  Since the height of the hexagon is 2, the height of the smallest region is 1.  Therefore, the area of the smallest region, `a`, is:\n    *  `a = (1/2) * (1/2) * 1 = 1/4`\n* **Largest Region:**  Consider the largest region at the bottom.  Its base is one side of the hexagon (2 units).  Its height is also the distance from the central point to the base of the hexagon (1 unit).  Therefore, the area of the largest region, `b`, is:\n    *  `b = 2 * 1 = 2`\n**4.  Finding the Ratio**\nThe ratio of the smallest to largest region is:\n* `a : b = (1/4) : 2 = 1 : 8`\n**Therefore, the ratio a:b is 1:8.** \n",
        "**1. Find the areas of basic shapes**\n* **The hexagon:** The hexagon can be divided into two congruent trapezoids.  Each trapezoid has bases of length 1 and 2, and height 1.  Therefore, the area of the hexagon is $2\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}(1+2)(1) = 3$.\n* **Triangle ABC:** This is a right triangle with legs of length 1 and 2, so its area is $\\frac{1}{2}(1)(2) = 1$.\n* **Triangle BCD:**  This is a right triangle with legs of length 1 and 1, so its area is $\\frac{1}{2}(1)(1) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n**2. Identify the smallest and largest regions**\n* **Smallest:**  The smallest region is the triangle formed by the intersection of diagonal $AC$ and diagonal $BD$. This is a triangle with base of length 1 and height of length $\\frac{1}{2}$ (half the height of triangle $BCD$), so its area is $\\frac{1}{2}(1)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n* **Largest:** The largest region is the quadrilateral $GPRS$.  To find its area, we can subtract the areas of smaller regions from the area of the hexagon.  The quadrilateral is formed by taking the hexagon and removing triangles $ABC$, $BCD$, and $GSIH$.  Its area is $3 - 1 - \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{9}{4}$.\n**3. Calculate the ratio**\nThe ratio of the smallest area to the largest area is $\\frac{1}{4}:\\frac{9}{4} = \\boxed{1:9}$. \n"
