        "Here's how to solve the problem step by step:\n**1. Find the lengths of the legs**\n* Since $\\tan Z = \\frac{opposite}{adjacent} = \\frac{WZ}{YZ} = 1.5$, and $YZ = 12$, we have $WZ = 1.5 \\cdot 12 = 18$.\n* Similarly, since $\\tan X = \\frac{opposite}{adjacent} = \\frac{WX}{XY} = 3$, and we know $WZ = 18$ (since $WX \\parallel ZY$), we can find $XY$: \n   * $3 = \\frac{18}{XY} \\Rightarrow XY = 6$.\n**2. Find the height**\n* The height of the trapezoid is $WY$, which is also the length of the leg adjacent to angle $Z$ in triangle $WYZ$. \n* Since $\\tan Z = \\frac{WZ}{WY} = 1.5$, we have  $WY = \\frac{WZ}{1.5} = \\frac{18}{1.5} = 12$.\n**3. Calculate the area**\n* The area of a trapezoid is given by:  $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot height \\cdot (base_1 + base_2)$\n* In this case, the bases are $ZY = 12$ and $WX = 18 + 6 = 24$ \n* So, the area of $WXYZ$ is: $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 12 \\cdot (12 + 24) = \\boxed{216}$. \n",
        "**1. Understand the given information:**\n* We are given a trapezoid WXYZ with parallel sides WX and ZY.\n* WY is perpendicular to ZY, making angle WYZ a right angle.\n* YZ = 12\n* tan Z = 1.5 \n* tan X = 3\n**2. Use the tangent to find side lengths:**\n*  **In right triangle WYZ:** \n   * tan Z = opposite/adjacent = WY/YZ = 1.5\n   * Since YZ = 12, we can solve for WY: 1.5 = WY/12 => WY = 18\n* **In right triangle WXZ:**\n   * tan X = opposite/adjacent = WZ/WX = 3\n   * We don't know WZ or WX yet, so we'll leave this equation for now.\n**3. Find the lengths of WX and WZ:**\n* **Since WX is parallel to ZY, we know angle WXZ is supplementary to angle Z (they form a straight angle).**  This means:\n    * tan (180 - Z) = -tan Z = -1.5\n* **In right triangle WXZ:**\n    * tan (180 - Z) = WX/WZ = -1.5\n    * We can combine this with our earlier equation for tan X:\n       * WX/WZ = -1.5\n       * WZ/WX = 3\n* **Solving these two equations simultaneously:**\n    * Multiplying the equations together, we get (WX/WZ) * (WZ/WX) = -1.5 * 3\n    * This simplifies to 1 = -4.5, which is impossible. This means there's an error in our understanding of the problem or the given information.\n**4. Analyze the error:**\n* The error lies in assuming that tan (180 - Z) = -tan Z. This is only true for angles in the first and second quadrants.  Since angle Z is in the first quadrant (because it's an angle of a right triangle), angle (180 - Z) is in the second quadrant. \n* In the second quadrant, the tangent is negative, but it's not simply the negative of the tangent of the angle in the first quadrant.\n**5. Correct the approach:**\n* We need to use the correct relationship for tan (180 - Z) in the second quadrant: tan (180 - Z) = -tan Z = -1.5. \n* However, this relationship doesn't directly give us the ratio of WX and WZ.\n**6. Find WX and WZ using geometry:**\n* Since WX and ZY are parallel, we can use similar triangles.  Triangles WYZ and WXZ are similar.\n* Therefore, the ratio of corresponding sides is equal: WY/WZ = YZ/WX\n* We know WY = 18 and YZ = 12. Let's call WX = x.  Substituting:\n    * 18/WZ = 12/x\n* Solving for WZ: WZ = (18/12) * x = (3/2) * x\n**7. Calculate the area of trapezoid WXYZ:**\n* **Area of trapezoid = (1/2) * (sum of parallel sides) * (height)**\n* Sum of parallel sides = WX + ZY = x + 12\n* Height = WY = 18\n* Area = (1/2) * (x + 12) * 18 = 9x + 108\n**8.  We need to find x (the length of WX) to get the final area:**\n*  Unfortunately, we don't have enough information to find x.  We need one more piece of information, such as the length of WX or WZ, to solve for x and calculate the area of the trapezoid. \n",
