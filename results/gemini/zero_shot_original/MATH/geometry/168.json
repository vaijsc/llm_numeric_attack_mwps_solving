    "problem": "At a driver education class, the students were told to put their hands on the steering wheel on \"$3$'' and \"$9$'', just as on the face of a clock. If, instead, the students placed their hands on the \"$2$'' and the \"$10$'', by how many degrees would the angle between the hands (with the center of the wheel at the vertex of the angle) decrease?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "From ``$3$'' to ``$9$'' is a difference of 6 hours out of the 12 on the clock, so the hands are separated by $\\frac{6}{12}=\\frac{1}{2}$ of the degrees on the clock. From ``$2$'' to ``$10$,'' the smaller angle (clockwise from $10$ to $2$) is a difference of 4 hours out of 12 on the clock, so the hands are separated by $\\frac{4}{12}=\\frac{1}{3}$ of the degrees on the clock. The difference in the angles is $\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{1}{3}=\\frac{1}{6}$ of the degrees on the clock. Since the clock has $360^\\circ$, the angle decreases by $\\frac{360}{6}=\\boxed{60^\\circ}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Clock Analogy**\n* A clock face is divided into 12 hours, which means each hour mark represents 360 degrees / 12 hours = 30 degrees.\n* The \"3\" and \"9\" positions on the steering wheel are 6 hours apart (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).\n* The \"2\" and \"10\" positions are 8 hours apart (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10).\n**2. Calculate the Original Angle**\n* The angle between \"3\" and \"9\" is 6 hours * 30 degrees/hour = 180 degrees.\n**3. Calculate the New Angle**\n* The angle between \"2\" and \"10\" is 8 hours * 30 degrees/hour = 240 degrees.\n**4. Find the Difference**\n* The difference between the two angles is 240 degrees - 180 degrees = 60 degrees.\n**Answer:** The angle between the hands would decrease by **60 degrees**. \n",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Clock Analogy**\n* Imagine the steering wheel as a clock face.\n* The \"3\" and \"9\" positions represent a straight line (180 degrees).\n* The \"2\" and \"10\" positions are slightly closer together than the \"3\" and \"9\" positions.\n**2. Calculate the Angle Changes**\n* **Original Angle:** The angle between \"3\" and \"9\" is 180 degrees.\n* **New Angle:**  Each number on a clock face represents 30 degrees (360 degrees / 12 numbers = 30 degrees).  The angle between \"2\" and \"10\" is 8 numbers * 30 degrees/number = 240 degrees.\n**3. Determine the Decrease**\n* **Difference:** The angle decreased by 180 degrees - 240 degrees = -60 degrees.\n**Answer:** The angle between the hands would decrease by **60 degrees**. \n",
