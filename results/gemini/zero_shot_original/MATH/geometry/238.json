        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Relationship Between Angles and Arcs**\n* **Central Angle:** An angle whose vertex is at the center of the circle. The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.\n* **Inscribed Angle:** An angle whose vertex is on the circle and whose sides are chords of the circle. The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.\n**2. Apply the Relationships to the Given Information**\n* **Angle ROB:** This is a central angle that intercepts minor arc RB. \n* **Angle SOT:** This is a central angle that intercepts minor arc ST.\n* **Angle RTB:** This is an inscribed angle that intercepts minor arc RB.\n**3. Set Up Equations**\n* Since the measure of angle ROB is three times the measure of angle SOT, we can write:  \n  \u2220ROB = 3\u2220SOT\n* Since angle RTB is an inscribed angle, we know:\n  \u2220RTB = (1/2) \u2220ROB \n**4. Solve for the Unknown Angles**\n* We're given that \u2220RTB = 28\u00b0. Substitute this into the second equation:\n  28\u00b0 = (1/2) \u2220ROB\n  \u2220ROB = 56\u00b0 \n* Now substitute the value of \u2220ROB into the first equation:\n  56\u00b0 = 3\u2220SOT\n  \u2220SOT = 56\u00b0/3\n**5. Find the Measure of Minor Arc RS**\n*  Minor arc RS is the difference between minor arc RB and minor arc ST:\n  arc RS = arc RB - arc ST\n* Since central angles are equal to their intercepted arcs:\n  arc RS = \u2220ROB - \u2220SOT \n* Substitute the values we found:\n  arc RS = 56\u00b0 - (56\u00b0/3) = (112\u00b0/3)\n**Therefore, the measure of minor arc RS is 112/3 degrees.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.
