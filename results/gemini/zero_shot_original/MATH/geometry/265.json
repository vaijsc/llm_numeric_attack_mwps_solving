        "Here's how to find the volume of the cylinder step-by-step:\n**1. Recall the Formula**\nThe volume of a cylinder is calculated using the formula:\n   Volume = \u03c0 * r\u00b2 * h\n   where:\n   * \u03c0 (pi) is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14159\n   * r is the radius of the cylinder\n   * h is the height of the cylinder\n**2.  Plug in the Values**\nWe are given:\n*  r = 3 (radius)\n*  h = 10 (height)\nSubstitute these values into the formula:\nVolume = \u03c0 * (3)\u00b2 * 10\n**3. Calculate**\nVolume = 3.14159 * 9 * 10\nVolume = 282.7431 \n**Therefore, the volume of the cylinder is approximately 282.74 cubic units.** \n",
