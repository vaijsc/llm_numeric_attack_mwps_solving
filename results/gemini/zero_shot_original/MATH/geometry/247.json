        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Relationships**\n* **Interior Angle and Exterior Angle:** At each vertex of a polygon, an interior angle and an exterior angle form a linear pair (they add up to 180 degrees).\n* **Interior Angle Formula:** The measure of each interior angle of a regular polygon with *n* sides is given by:  (n - 2) * 180 / n\n* **Exterior Angle Formula:** The measure of each exterior angle of a regular polygon with *n* sides is given by: 360 / n \n**2. Set Up the Equation**\nLet:\n*  *x* = the measure of each exterior angle\nWe are told that the interior angle is 6.5 times the exterior angle:\n* Interior angle = 6.5 * x\nSince the interior and exterior angles are supplementary:\n*  Interior angle + Exterior angle = 180\u00b0\n*  6.5 * x + x = 180\u00b0\n**3. Solve for x**\n* 7.5 * x = 180\u00b0\n* x = 180\u00b0 / 7.5\n* x = 24\u00b0\n**4. Find the Number of Sides (n)**\n* Exterior angle = 360 / n\n* 24\u00b0 = 360 / n\n* n * 24\u00b0 = 360\u00b0\n* n = 360\u00b0 / 24\u00b0\n* n = 15\n**Answer:** The polygon has **15** sides. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Relationships**\n* **Interior Angle and Exterior Angle:** An interior angle and its corresponding exterior angle are supplementary, meaning they add up to 180 degrees.\n* **Polygon Angles:** The sum of the interior angles of an n-sided polygon is (n-2) * 180 degrees.\n**2. Set up the Equation**\nLet:\n*  x = the measure of an exterior angle\nSince the interior angle is 6.5 times the exterior angle, the interior angle measures 6.5x. \nWe know:\n* x + 6.5x = 180  (interior angle + exterior angle = 180 degrees)\n**3. Solve for x**\n* 7.5x = 180\n* x = 24  (This is the measure of the exterior angle)\n**4. Find the Number of Sides**\n* Each exterior angle of a regular polygon is equal to 360 degrees / number of sides.\n* 24 = 360 / n\n* n = 360 / 24\n* n = 15\n**Answer:** The polygon has **15** sides. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Relationship**\n* **Interior Angle:** An angle formed inside the polygon by two adjacent sides.\n* **Exterior Angle:** An angle formed by one side of the polygon and the extension of an adjacent side.\n* **Key Relationship:**  The interior angle and its corresponding exterior angle are supplementary (they add up to 180 degrees).\n**2. Set up the Equation**\nLet:\n*  'x' be the measure of the exterior angle.\n*  '6.5x' be the measure of the interior angle.\nSince they are supplementary:\nx + 6.5x = 180\n**3. Solve for the Exterior Angle**\n* Combine like terms: 7.5x = 180\n* Divide both sides by 7.5: x = 24 degrees\n**4. Find the Number of Sides**\n* **Formula:** The sum of the exterior angles of any polygon is 360 degrees.\n* **Calculation:**  To find the number of sides (n), divide 360 by the measure of one exterior angle:  n = 360 / 24 = 15\n**Answer:** The polygon has **15 sides**. \n",

Use the formula for the sum of interior angles:**\n* Let 'n' be the number of sides of the polygon.\n* (n - 2) * 180 = (number of sides - 2) * 180 = sum of interior angles\n**6. Since each interior angle is 156 degrees, find the total sum:**\n* Total sum of interior angles = 156 * n \n**7. Set up the equation and solve for 'n':**\n* 156n = (n - 2) * 180\n* 156n = 180n - 360\n* 360 = 24n\n* n = 15\n**Therefore, the polygon has 15 sides.** \n",
