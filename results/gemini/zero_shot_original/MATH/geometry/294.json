    "solution": "Our initial cube has 6 faces with 9 square inches of surface area each for a total of 54 square inches. When we cut away the 8 cubes of side length one, we remove 3 square inches of surface area for each one for a total of 24 square inches of surface area lost. We then add a 2 inch cube to each corner for a total of 8 more cubes. A 2 inch cube has a surface area of 24 but each of these cubes is missing 3 $\\text{in}^2$ of surface area, so the total surface area is $54-24+8(24-3)=\\boxed{198}$ square inches.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Start with the original cube:**\n* The original cube has a side length of 3 inches.\n* Its surface area is 6 * (side)^2 = 6 * (3)^2 = 54 square inches.\n**2. Cutting out the corner cubes:**\n* We cut out 8 cubes, each with a side length of 1 inch.\n* Each cut removes 6 * (1)^2 = 6 square inches from the surface area.\n* So, we remove a total of 8 * 6 = 48 square inches from the original cube.\n**3. Inserting the new corner cubes:**\n* We insert 8 cubes, each with a side length of 2 inches.\n* Each new cube adds 6 * (2)^2 = 24 square inches to the surface area.\n* In total, the new cubes add 8 * 24 = 192 square inches to the surface area.\n**4. Calculating the final surface area:**\n*  We start with the original surface area of 54 square inches.\n* We remove 48 square inches due to the cuts.\n* We add 192 square inches due to the inserted cubes.\n* The final surface area is 54 - 48 + 192 = **198 square inches**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Start with the Original Cube:**\n* The original cube has a side length of 3 inches.\n* Its surface area is 6 * (side)^2 = 6 * 3^2 = 54 square inches.\n**2. Cutting Out Smaller Cubes:**\n* We cut out a 1-inch cube from each corner.  This leaves 8 smaller cubes (1-inch cubes) missing from the original cube.\n**3.  The Remaining Cube:**\n* After cutting out the corner cubes, the remaining solid is still a cube but with smaller dimensions. Its side length is now 3 inches - 2 * 1 inch = 1 inch (since we removed 1 inch from each end).\n**4.  Inserting the Larger Cubes:**\n* We insert a 2-inch cube into each of the 8 corners that we cut out. \n**5.  Calculating the Surface Area:**\n* **Faces of the Original Cube:**  Each face of the original cube has an area of 3 * 3 = 9 square inches. But, we've removed a 1-inch square from each corner, leaving a 1 * 1 = 1 square inch hole. So, each face of the original cube has 9 - 4 = 5 square inches remaining. There are 6 faces, so this contributes 6 * 5 = 30 square inches to the total surface area.\n* **Faces of the Inserted Cubes:** Each inserted cube has a surface area of 6 * 2^2 = 24 square inches. Since there are 8 inserted cubes, they contribute 8 * 24 = 192 square inches to the total surface area.\n* **Total Surface Area:** The total surface area of the resulting solid is 30 + 192 = **222 square inches.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. The Initial Cube:**\n* The original cube has a side length of 3 inches.\n* Its surface area is 6 * side\u00b2 = 6 * 3\u00b2 = 54 square inches.\n**2. Cutting the Corners:**\n* We cut out 8 small cubes, each with a side length of 1 inch.\n* Each small cube has a surface area of 6 * side\u00b2 = 6 * 1\u00b2 = 6 square inches.\n* In total, we remove 8 * 6 = 48 square inches of surface area.\n**3. The Remaining Cube:**\n* After cutting the corners, we have a cube with a side length of 3 - 1 - 1 = 1 inch.\n* Its surface area is 6 * side\u00b2 = 6 * 1\u00b2 = 6 square inches.\n**4. Inserting the Larger Cubes:**\n* We insert 8 cubes, each with a side length of 2 inches.\n* Each of these cubes has a surface area of 6 * side\u00b2 = 6 * 2\u00b2 = 24 square inches.\n* However, only 3 of the faces of each inserted cube are visible.  We need to consider this when calculating the surface area.\n**5. The Total Surface Area:**\n* Start with the initial surface area: 54 square inches.\n* Subtract the surface area of the removed corners: 54 - 48 = 6 square inches.\n* Add the surface area of the remaining cube: 6 + 6 = 12 square inches.\n* Add the surface area of the inserted cubes, remembering only 3 faces are exposed: 12 + 8 * 24 * 3 = 588 square inches.\n**Therefore, the surface area of the resulting solid is 588 square inches.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Start with the Original Cube**\n* The original cube has a side length of 3 inches.\n* Its surface area is 6 * (side length)\u00b2 = 6 * (3\u00b2) = 54 square inches.\n**2.  Cutting the Corners**\n* We cut out a 1-inch cube from each corner. This leaves us with a smaller cube in the center.\n* The smaller cube has a side length of 3 - 2 = 1 inch (since we removed 1 inch from each end of the original side).\n**3.  The Smaller Cube's Surface Area**\n* The smaller cube has a surface area of 6 * (side length)\u00b2 = 6 * (1\u00b2) = 6 square inches.\n**4.  Adding the Smaller Cubes**\n* We insert a 2-inch cube into each of the eight corners we cut out. \n* Each of these smaller cubes has a surface area of 6 * (side length)\u00b2 = 6 * (2\u00b2) = 24 square inches.\n* Since there are eight of them, their total surface area is 8 * 24 = 192 square inches.\n**5.  Calculating the Final Surface Area**\n* We need to consider that some of the surface area of the smaller cubes is hidden inside the larger shape. \n*  The hidden area is a square face of each of the smaller cubes, which has an area of 2\u00b2 = 4 square inches. Since there are eight smaller cubes, the total hidden area is 8 * 4 = 32 square inches.\n* Therefore, the total surface area of the resulting solid is:\n   * Original cube's surface area - smaller cube's surface area + (smaller cubes' surface area - hidden surface area)\n   * 54 - 6 + (192 - 32) = **208 square inches** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualizing the Cuts and Insertions:**\n* Imagine a 3x3x3 cube.\n* You cut out a 1x1x1 cube from each of the 8 corners.\n* This leaves you with a smaller cube in the center.\n* You then insert a 2x2x2 cube into each of the 8 corner cavities.\n**2. Analyzing the Surface Area:**\n* **Original Cube:** The original cube had a surface area of 6 * 3 * 3 = 54 square inches.\n* **Corner Cuts:** Each corner cut removes a 1x1x1 cube with a surface area of 6 square inches, so you remove 8 * 6 = 48 square inches of surface area. \n* **Corner Insertions:**  Each corner insertion adds a 2x2x2 cube with a surface area of 6 * 2 * 2 = 24 square inches. This adds a total of 8 * 24 = 192 square inches of surface area. \n* **The Central Cube:** The central cube is a 1x1x1 cube with a surface area of 6 square inches.\n**3. Calculating the Total Surface Area:**\n* **Start with the original surface area:** 54 square inches\n* **Subtract the surface area removed by the cuts:** 54 - 48 = 6 square inches\n* **Add the surface area added by the insertions:** 6 + 192 = 198 square inches\n* **Add the surface area of the central cube:** 198 + 6 = 204 square inches\n**Therefore, the surface area of the resulting solid is 204 square inches.** \n"
