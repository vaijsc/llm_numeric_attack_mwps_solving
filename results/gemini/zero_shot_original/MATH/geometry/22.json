The hypotenuse of a right triangle that is inscribed in a circle is a diameter of the circle, so $\\overline{AB}$ is the diameter of the circle.  Since point $C$ is on the circle, point $C$ is $100/2=50$ units from the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$ (which is the center of the circle).  So, point $C$ cannot be any more than 50 units from $\\overline{AB}$.  This maximum can be achieved when $\\overline{OC}\\perp\\overline{AB}$.  The area of $\\triangle ABC$ then is $(50)(100)/2 = \\boxed{2500}$ square units.\n\n[asy]\npair A,B,C,O;\nA = (-1,0);\nB=-A;\nC = (0,1);\ndraw(A--B--C--A);\ndraw(C--(0,0),dashed);\nO = (0,0);\nlabel(\"$O$\",O,S);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,W);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,E);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,N);\ndraw(Circle(O,1));\n[/asy]",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understanding the Setup**\n* **Right Triangle:**  A right triangle has one 90-degree angle.\n* **Inscribed:** The triangle fits completely inside the circle, with all three vertices on the circle's circumference.\n* **Diameter:** The diameter of the circle is the longest chord and passes through the center. \n**2. Key Insight**\nThe key to maximizing the triangle's area is to recognize that the diameter of the circle is the hypotenuse of the right triangle.  This is because the diameter is the longest possible chord, and it cuts the circle into two semicircles, each containing one leg of the triangle.\n**3. Finding the Maximum Area**\n* **Hypotenuse:** The hypotenuse (diameter) is 100 units.\n* **Legs:**  To maximize the area, the legs of the right triangle should be as close in length as possible.  This means we want an isosceles right triangle.\n* **45-45-90 Triangle:**  An isosceles right triangle is a special type of right triangle with angles of 45-45-90 degrees. The ratio of the sides is 1:1:\u221a2.\n* **Side Lengths:** Since the hypotenuse is 100, each leg has a length of 100/\u221a2 = 50\u221a2 units.\n**4. Calculating the Area**\n* **Area of a Triangle:**  Area = (1/2) * base * height\n* **In this case:** Base = height = 50\u221a2\n* **Maximum Area:** (1/2) * (50\u221a2) * (50\u221a2) = 2500 square units\n**Answer:** The maximum area of the right triangle is **2500 square units**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Setup**\n* **Inscribed Triangle:** A triangle is inscribed in a circle if all three of its vertices lie on the circle's circumference.\n* **Diameter:** The diameter of a circle is a line segment that passes through the center and has endpoints on the circle.\n**2. Key Observation**\n* **Maximum Area:**  The maximum area of a right triangle inscribed in a circle occurs when the triangle is a **right isosceles triangle**. This means two of its sides are equal in length and form the right angle.\n**3.

Calculations**\n* **Hypotenuse:**  The diameter of the circle is 100 units, so the hypotenuse of the triangle is 100 units.\n* **Legs:** Since the triangle is isosceles, each leg has length 100/\u221a2 = 50\u221a2 units.\n* **Area:** The area of a right triangle is (1/2) * base * height.  In this case, the area is (1/2) * (50\u221a2) * (50\u221a2) = 2500 square units.\n**Answer:** The maximum area of the inscribed right triangle is **2500 square units**. \n",

Understand the Geometry**\n* **Inscribed Triangle:** A triangle inscribed in a circle has all its vertices on the circle's circumference.\n* **Diameter as Hypotenuse:** When a right triangle is inscribed in a circle, the diameter of the circle is always the hypotenuse of the triangle.\n**2. Key Insight**\nThe maximum area of a right triangle inscribed in a circle occurs when the triangle is a **right isosceles triangle**.  This means the two legs of the triangle are equal in length.\n**3. Finding the Legs**\n* **Hypotenuse:** The diameter of the circle is 100 units, so the hypotenuse of the triangle is also 100 units.\n* **Pythagorean Theorem:**  Since it's an isosceles right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of each leg:\n   *  Let each leg have length  'x'.\n   *  x\u00b2 + x\u00b2 = 100\u00b2\n   *  2x\u00b2 = 10000\n   *  x\u00b2 = 5000\n   *  x = \u221a5000 = 50\u221a2  (We take the positive root since length cannot be negative)\n**4.

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Setup**\nImagine a circle with a diameter of 100 units.  A right triangle is inscribed inside, meaning all three vertices of the triangle lie on the circle's circumference.\n**2. Key Observation**\nThe key is to realize that the diameter of the circle is also the hypotenuse of the right triangle. This is because when you draw a right triangle inscribed in a circle, the diameter passing through the right angle becomes the hypotenuse.\n**3. Maximum Area**\nTo maximize the area of a right triangle with a fixed hypotenuse, we need to make the legs (the two shorter sides) as close to equal in length as possible. This is because the area of a triangle is given by (1/2) * base * height, and the base and height are the legs of the right triangle.\n**4. Isosceles Right Triangle**\nThe scenario that maximizes the area is when the right triangle is an isosceles right triangle (a 45-45-90 triangle).  \n**5.  Calculating the Legs**\nSince the hypotenuse is 100 units, and the legs are equal in an isosceles right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:\n* a\u00b2 + a\u00b2 = 100\u00b2 \n* 2a\u00b2 = 10000\n* a\u00b2 = 5000\n* a = \u221a5000 = 50\u221a2\n**6. Calculating the Area**\nThe area of the right triangle is:\n* (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * (50\u221a2) * (50\u221a2) = 2500 square units\n**Answer:** The maximum area of the inscribed right triangle is **2500 square units**. \n"
