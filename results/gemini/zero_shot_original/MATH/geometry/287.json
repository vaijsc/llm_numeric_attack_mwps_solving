        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the side length of the original cube:**\n* **Formula:** Surface area of a cube = 6 * (side length)\u00b2\n* **Given:** Surface area = 600 square inches\n* **Solve for side length:**\n   * 600 = 6 * (side length)\u00b2\n   * 100 = (side length)\u00b2\n   * side length = 10 inches\n**2. Find the side length of the new cube:**\n* **Given:** The edges of the new cube are doubled.\n* **New side length:** 10 inches * 2 = 20 inches\n**3. Calculate the volume of the new cube:**\n* **Formula:** Volume of a cube = (side length)\u00b3\n* **New side length:** 20 inches\n* **Volume:** 20 inches * 20 inches * 20 inches = 8000 cubic inches\n**Therefore, the volume of the new cube is 8000 cubic inches.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the side length of the original cube:**\n* The surface area of a cube is 6 times the area of one of its faces. \n* So, the area of one face is 600 square inches / 6 = 100 square inches.\n* The side length of a square is the square root of its area, so the side length of the original cube is \u221a100 inches = 10 inches.\n**2. Find the side length of the new cube:**\n* The edges of the original cube are doubled, so the new cube has a side length of 10 inches * 2 = 20 inches.\n**3. Calculate the volume of the new cube:**\n* The volume of a cube is side length cubed. \n* So, the volume of the new cube is 20 inches * 20 inches * 20 inches = 8000 cubic inches.\n**Answer:** The volume of the new cube is **8000 cubic inches**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the side length of the original cube:**\n* **Surface area of a cube:** 6 * (side length)^2\n* **Given surface area:** 600 square inches\n* **Set up the equation:** 6 * (side length)^2 = 600\n* **Solve for side length:**\n    * (side length)^2 = 100\n    * side length = 10 inches\n**2. Find the side length of the new cube:**\n* The edges of the new cube are doubled, so the side length is 10 inches * 2 = 20 inches\n**3. Calculate the volume of the new cube:**\n* **Volume of a cube:** (side length)^3\n* **Volume of the new cube:** (20 inches)^3 = 8000 cubic inches\n**Therefore, the volume of the new cube is 8000 cubic inches.** \n",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the side length of the original cube:**\n* The surface area of a cube is calculated by 6 * (side length)^2.\n* We know the surface area is 600 square inches.\n* So, 6 * (side length)^2 = 600\n* Divide both sides by 6: (side length)^2 = 100\n* Take the square root of both sides: side length = 10 inches\n**2.
