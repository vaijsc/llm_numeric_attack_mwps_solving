    "solution": "The hemisphere-shaped milk cup has volume \\[\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (3^3) = 2\\cdot 3^2\\pi = 18\\pi\\] cubic inches.  A cylindrical container with height $h$ has volume \\[\\pi(2^2)(h)=4\\pi h\\] cubic inches.  The milk will fit if \\[4\\pi h \\ge 18\\pi.\\]   Dividing both sides of the inequality by $4\\pi$ gives \\[h\\ge 4.5,\\]  so the minimum height is $\\boxed{4.5}$ inches.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the volume of the hemispherical cup:**\n* The volume of a sphere is (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3, so the volume of a hemisphere is (2/3)\u03c0r\u00b3.\n* The radius of the cup is 3 inches, so the volume of the milk is (2/3)\u03c0(3\u00b3) = 18\u03c0 cubic inches.\n**2. Find the volume of the cylindrical container:**\n* The volume of a cylinder is \u03c0r\u00b2h, where r is the radius and h is the height.\n* The radius of the container is 2 inches.  We want to find the minimum height (h) needed to hold the milk.\n**3. Set up an equation:**\n* The volume of the milk must be equal to the volume of the cylinder: 18\u03c0 = \u03c0(2\u00b2)h\n**4. Solve for the height (h):**\n* Simplify the equation: 18\u03c0 = 4\u03c0h\n* Divide both sides by 4\u03c0: h = 18\u03c0 / 4\u03c0 = 4.5 inches\n**Answer:** The minimum height of the container is **4.5 inches**. \n",
