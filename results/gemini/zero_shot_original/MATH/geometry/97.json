    "solution": "Let $s$ be the side length of the cube. Then $s^3$ is the volume, so $s^3 = .027$. Taking the cube root of both sides gives $s = .3$. The area of one face of the cube is thus $s^2 = .09$. There are six faces, so the surface area is $6(.09) = \\boxed{0.54}$ square meters.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the side length of the cube:**\n* The volume of a cube is calculated by  V = s\u00b3, where 's' is the side length.\n* We know the volume is 0.027 cubic meters. \n* So, 0.027 = s\u00b3\n* To find 's', take the cube root of 0.027:  s = \u00b3\u221a0.027 = 0.3 meters\n**2. Calculate the surface area:**\n* The surface area of a cube is calculated by A = 6s\u00b2, where 's' is the side length.\n* We know the side length is 0.3 meters.\n* So, A = 6 * (0.3)\u00b2 = 6 * 0.09 = 0.54 square meters.\n**Answer:** The surface area of the cube is **0.54 square meters**. \n",
