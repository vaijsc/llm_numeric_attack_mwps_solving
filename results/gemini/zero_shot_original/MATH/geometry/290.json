    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The surface area of the can excluding the lids is expressed as Circumference $\\times$ Height.  Therefore, since the height is 6 inches, the circumference is $10\\pi$.  Since Circumference $= 2\\pi r$, we have radius = $\\boxed{5\\text{ inches}}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n* **Visualize the label:** Imagine the label as a rectangle that wraps around the can. The length of this rectangle is the circumference of the can, and the width is the height of the can.\n* **Formulate the equation:** Let 'r' be the radius of the can. \n    * The circumference of the can is 2\u03c0r.\n    * The area of the label is (circumference) * (height) = (2\u03c0r) * 6 \n* **Solve for the radius:** We know the area of the label is 60\u03c0 square inches.  Set up the equation:\n    (2\u03c0r) * 6 = 60\u03c0\n    12\u03c0r = 60\u03c0\n    r = 60\u03c0 / 12\u03c0\n    r = 5\n**Therefore, the radius of the can is 5 inches.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Geometry**\n* The label represents the lateral surface area of the cylinder (the area of the curved side).\n* The lateral surface area of a cylinder is calculated as the product of the circumference of the base and the height:  Lateral Surface Area = 2\u03c0rh, where 'r' is the radius and 'h' is the height.\n**2. Set up the Equation**\nWe know:\n* Lateral Surface Area = 60\u03c0 square inches\n* Height (h) = 6 inches\nSubstitute these values into the formula:\n60\u03c0 = 2\u03c0r(6)\n**3. Solve for the Radius (r)**\n* Simplify the equation: 60\u03c0 = 12\u03c0r\n* Divide both sides by 12\u03c0: 60\u03c0 / 12\u03c0 = r\n* Calculate the result:  r = 5 inches\n**Answer:** The radius of the can is **5 inches**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Label**\n* The label covers the lateral surface area of the cylinder (the side).\n* It doesn't include the top or bottom circles.\n**2. Formula for Lateral Surface Area**\n* The lateral surface area of a cylinder is given by:  2\u03c0rh, where:\n    * r = radius of the cylinder\n    * h = height of the cylinder\n**3. Set up the Equation**\n* We know the label's area is 60\u03c0 square inches.\n* We know the height (h) is 6 inches. \n* Let 'r' represent the radius.\n* So, we can set up the equation: 2\u03c0rh = 60\u03c0\n**4. Solve for the Radius**\n* Substitute the known values: 2\u03c0 * r * 6 = 60\u03c0\n* Simplify: 12\u03c0r = 60\u03c0\n* Divide both sides by 12\u03c0: r = 60\u03c0 / 12\u03c0\n* Cancel out \u03c0 and simplify: r = 5\n**Answer:** The radius of the can is **5 inches**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n* **Visualize the Label:** Imagine the label as a rectangle that you would wrap around the can. The height of this rectangle is the same as the height of the can (6 inches). The length of the rectangle is the circumference of the can's base.\n* **Relate Area to Circumference:** The area of the label is given as 60\u03c0 square inches. This is equal to the product of the height and the length (circumference) of the label:  \n   Area = Height \u00d7 Circumference \n   60\u03c0 = 6 \u00d7 Circumference\n* **Solve for Circumference:** Divide both sides of the equation by 6 to find the circumference:\n    Circumference = 60\u03c0 / 6 = 10\u03c0 inches\n* **Find the Radius:** The circumference of a circle is given by the formula:\n    Circumference = 2\u03c0r (where 'r' is the radius)\n    10\u03c0 = 2\u03c0r\n* **Solve for the Radius:** Divide both sides of the equation by 2\u03c0:\n    r = 10\u03c0 / 2\u03c0 = 5 inches\n**Therefore, the radius of the can is 5 inches.** \n",
