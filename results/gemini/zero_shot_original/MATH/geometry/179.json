        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the edge length of the first cube:**\n* The volume of a cube is calculated by  Volume = side * side * side (side\u00b3)\n* We know the volume of the first cube is 343 cubic centimeters.  \n* To find the side length, take the cube root of 343:  \u221b343 = 7 centimeters\n**2. Find the edge length of the second cube:**\n* The edge length of the second cube is three times the edge length of the first cube.\n* Edge length of second cube = 3 * 7 centimeters = 21 centimeters\n**3. Calculate the volume of the second cube:**\n* Volume of second cube = 21 centimeters * 21 centimeters * 21 centimeters = 9261 cubic centimeters\n**4. Find the difference in volume:**\n* Difference = Volume of second cube - Volume of first cube\n* Difference = 9261 cubic centimeters - 343 cubic centimeters = 8918 cubic centimeters\n**Answer:** The positive difference between the volume of the second cube and the volume of the first cube is **8918 cubic centimeters**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the edge length of the first cube:**\n* Since the volume of a cube is side * side * side (s\u00b3), we need to find the cube root of 343 cubic centimeters.\n* The cube root of 343 is 7 (7 * 7 * 7 = 343).  So, the edge length of the first cube is 7 centimeters.\n**2. Find the edge length of the second cube:**\n* The edge length of the second cube is three times the edge length of the first cube.\n* 3 * 7 centimeters = 21 centimeters\n**3. Find the volume of the second cube:**\n* Volume of the second cube is 21 centimeters * 21 centimeters * 21 centimeters = 9261 cubic centimeters.\n**4. Calculate the difference in volumes:**\n*  The difference between the volume of the second cube and the first cube is 9261 cubic centimeters - 343 cubic centimeters = 8918 cubic centimeters.\n**Answer:** The positive difference between the volume of the second cube and the volume of the first cube is **8918 cubic centimeters**. \n",
