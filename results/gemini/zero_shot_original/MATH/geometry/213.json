        "Here's how to find the area of the square:\n**1. Visualize the Square**\nImagine plotting the points on a coordinate plane.  You'll see that the square is tilted at a 45-degree angle.\n**2. Find the Side Length**\n* **Horizontal/Vertical Distance:**  Notice that the horizontal distance between any two adjacent vertices is 4 units (e.g., from (-2,2) to (2,-2)). \n* **Diagonal:**  The diagonal of the square is also the hypotenuse of a right triangle formed by two sides of the square.  Since the square is tilted at 45 degrees, this right triangle is a 45-45-90 triangle.\n* **Special Triangle Ratios:** In a 45-45-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1:1:\u221a2.  Since the diagonal (hypotenuse) has a length of 4\u221a2 (using the distance formula or by recognizing the pattern of the coordinates), each side of the square has a length of 4.\n**3. Calculate the Area**\nThe area of a square is side length squared:\n* Area = side\u00b2 = 4\u00b2 = **16 square units** \n",
