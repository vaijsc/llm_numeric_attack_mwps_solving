She builds a glass sphere around the two fruits to contain them, making the sphere as small as possible.  When she has done this, the volume contained within the sphere, but not in the plum or the watermelon, is $K\\pi$.  What is the value of $K$?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "In order to make the glass sphere as small as possible, the plum and the watermelon should be touching---that is, they should be externally tangent spheres.  Since the plum has a point that has distance 20 from another point on the watermelon, any sphere containing the plum and the watermelon must have radius at least 10.  On the other hand, Rose can enclose them both in a sphere of radius 10, as shown in the diagram below:\n\n[asy]\nvoid spherebelt(pair c, real r, real t=.2, int prec=15){\n\nguide bot, toppom;\n\nreal delt = 2*r/prec;\n\nreal x = c.x - r;\n\nreal dy;\n\nfor (int i=0; i <= prec;++i){\n\ndy = t* sqrt(r**2 - (x-c.x)**2);\n\nbot = bot..(x,c.y-dy);\n\ntoppom = toppom..(x,c.y+dy);\n\nx += delt;\n\n}\n\npath bottom = bot;\n\npath top = toppom;\n\ndraw(bottom);\n\ndraw(top,dashed);\n}\n\nfill(circle((-2,0),2),rgb(.7,0,.7));\nfill(circle((8,0),8),rgb(0,.8,0));\n\ndraw(circle((-2,0),2));\ndraw(circle((8,0),8));\ndraw(circle((6,0),10));\n\nspherebelt((-2,0),2);\nspherebelt((8,0),8);\n[/asy]\n\nThus the smallest sphere that can contain the plum and the watermelon has radius 10.  So it remains to subtract the volumes of a sphere of radius 2 and a sphere of radius 8 from a sphere of radius 10. Since the volume of a sphere of radius $r$ is $\\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3$, it follows that the volume in question is \\begin{align*} \\frac{4}{3} \\pi \\cdot 10^3 - \\frac{4}{3}\n\\pi \\cdot 8^3 - \\frac{4}{3} \\pi \\cdot 2^3\n&= \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (10^3 - 8^3 - 2^3) \\\\\n&= \\frac{4}{3} \\pi ( 1000 - 512 - 8)\\\\\n&= \\frac{4}{3} \\pi \\cdot 480 = 640 \\pi .\n\\end{align*}Therefore our answer is $\\boxed{640}$.\n\nWe could also have simplified the final computation by noting that in general \\[ (a+b)^3 - a^3 - b^3 = 3a^2b + 3ab^2 = 3ab(a+b) . \\]Setting $a=2$ and $b=8$, we have \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{4}{3}\\pi (a+b)^3 - \\frac{4}{3} \\pi a^3 - \\frac{4}{3} \\pi b^3\n&= \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\bigl[ (a+b)^3 - a^3 - b^3 \\bigr]\\\\\n&= \\frac{4}{3} \\pi \\cdot 3ab(a+b) = 4 \\pi ab(a+b) . \\end{align*}This tells us that $K = 4ab(a+b) = 4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 10 = 640$, as before.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Situation**\nImagine the plum and watermelon nestled together inside the glass sphere.  The smallest possible glass sphere will be one where the plum and watermelon touch at a single point. This means the centers of the plum, watermelon, and the glass sphere will all lie on a straight line.\n**2.

Find the Radius of the Glass Sphere**\n* The distance from the center of the plum to the center of the watermelon is 2 + 8 = 10.\n* Since the plum and watermelon touch at a point, the radius of the glass sphere is half the distance between their centers, which is 10/2 = 5.\n**4. Calculate Volumes**\n* **Volume of the Glass Sphere:**  (4/3)\u03c0(5\u00b3) = (500/3)\u03c0\n* **Volume of the Plum:** (4/3)\u03c0(2\u00b3) = (32/3)\u03c0\n* **Volume of the Watermelon:** (4/3)\u03c0(8\u00b3) = (2048/3)\u03c0\n**5. Find the Volume of the Empty Space**\nSubtract the volumes of the plum and watermelon from the volume of the glass sphere:\n(500/3)\u03c0 - (32/3)\u03c0 - (2048/3)\u03c0 = (220/3)\u03c0\n**6.

Visualize the Situation**\nImagine a smaller sphere (the plum) nestled inside a larger sphere (the watermelon), both centered at the same point. The glass sphere needs to be large enough to completely enclose both the plum and the watermelon.\n**2. Find the Diameter of the Watermelon**\nThe diameter of the watermelon is twice its radius: 8 * 2 = 16\n**3. Determine the Radius of the Glass Sphere**\nThe glass sphere's radius must be equal to the distance from the center of the spheres to the furthest point on the watermelon's surface.  Since the plum and watermelon share the same center, this distance is simply the radius of the watermelon plus the radius of the plum: 8 + 2 = 10\n**4. Calculate the Volume of the Glass Sphere**\nThe volume of a sphere is given by (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3, where r is the radius.
