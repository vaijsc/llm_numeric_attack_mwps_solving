        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understanding the Setup**\n* We have a triangle ABC.\n* Point D lies on side BC and is equidistant from A, B, and C. This means triangle ABD, triangle ACD, and triangle BCD are all isosceles triangles.\n**2. Finding Angles**\n* **Triangle ABD:** Since it's isosceles, we have  \u2220BAD = \u2220BDA.\n* **Triangle ACD:**  Since it's isosceles, we have \u2220CAD = \u2220CDA.\n* **Triangle BCD:**  Since it's isosceles, we have \u2220CBD = \u2220CDB.\n**3. Using Angle Sum Property**\n* **In triangle ABC:** \u2220ABC + \u2220ACB + \u2220BAC = 180\u00b0\n* **Substitute:** 50\u00b0 + \u2220ACB + (\u2220BAD + \u2220CAD) = 180\u00b0 \n* **Simplify:** \u2220ACB + \u2220BAD + \u2220CAD = 130\u00b0\n**4. Using Angle Relationships**\n* **Angles around point D:** \u2220BDA + \u2220CDA + \u2220CDB = 360\u00b0\n* **Substitute using isosceles triangle properties:** (\u2220BAD) + (\u2220CAD) + (\u2220CBD) = 360\u00b0\n* **Since \u2220CBD = 50\u00b0:** \u2220BAD + \u2220CAD = 310\u00b0\n**5. Solving for \u2220ACB**\n* We have two equations:\n    * \u2220ACB + \u2220BAD + \u2220CAD = 130\u00b0\n    * \u2220BAD + \u2220CAD = 310\u00b0\n* **Subtract the second equation from the first:** \u2220ACB = 130\u00b0 - 310\u00b0 = -180\u00b0\n* **Since angles can't be negative, we need to adjust:** \u2220ACB = -180\u00b0 + 360\u00b0 = **180\u00b0**\n**Therefore, \u2220ACB = 180\u00b0.**\n**Important Note:** This solution suggests that triangle ABC is actually a straight line, which means it's not a real triangle.  This might indicate an error in the problem statement.  It's always good to check if the given information leads to a valid geometric figure. \n",
        "Here's how we can solve the problem:\n**1.  Understanding the Setup**\n* We have a triangle ABC.\n* Point D lies on side BC, dividing it into two equal segments (BD = DC).\n* We are given that DA = BD = DC, meaning triangle ABD and triangle ACD are isosceles.\n* We know angle ABC = 50 degrees.\n**2. Finding Angles in the Isosceles Triangles**\n* **Triangle ABD:** Since AD = BD, angles BAD and ABD are equal.  Let's call them 'x'. \n* **Triangle ACD:** Since AD = CD, angles CAD and ACD are equal. Let's call them 'y'.\n**3. Using the Angle Sum Property of Triangles**\n* **Triangle ABD:**  x + x + 50 = 180  (Sum of angles in a triangle)\n* **Triangle ACD:** y + y + 50 = 180 (Sum of angles in a triangle)\n**4. Solving for x and y**\n*  From the triangle ABD equation, 2x = 130, so x = 65 degrees.\n*  From the triangle ACD equation, 2y = 130, so y = 65 degrees.\n**5. Finding Angle ACB**\n*  Angle ACB is the same as angle ACD, which we found to be **65 degrees**.\n**Therefore, angle ACB is 65 degrees.** \n",

Therefore:\n   * $\\angle BAD = \\angle ABD$ \n   * $\\angle CAD = \\angle ACD$\n3. **Finding  $\\angle BAD$ and $\\angle CAD$:**  Since $\\angle ABC = 50^\\circ$, and $\\angle BAD = \\angle ABD$, we have $\\angle BAD = (180^\\circ - 50^\\circ)/2 = 65^\\circ$. Similarly, $\\angle CAD = 65^\\circ$.\n4. **Finding $\\angle ACB$:**  Finally, we can find $\\angle ACB$ using the angle sum property of triangles in $\\triangle ACD$: \n   * $\\angle ACB = 180^\\circ - \\angle CAD - \\angle ACD = 180^\\circ - 65^\\circ - 65^\\circ = \\boxed{50^\\circ}$. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Draw a Diagram**\nIt's always helpful to visualize the problem. Draw triangle ABC, with point D on line BC. Mark BD and DC as equal lengths, and mark DA as equal to them.\n**2. Identify Key Shapes**\nNotice that triangle ABD and triangle ACD are both isosceles triangles (two sides are equal).\n**3. Use Isosceles Triangle Properties**\n* In an isosceles triangle, the angles opposite the equal sides are also equal.  \n* The angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.\n**4.

Solving for \u2220ACB, we get  \u2220ACB = **50\u00b0**.\n**Therefore, \u2220ACB = 50\u00b0** \n",
