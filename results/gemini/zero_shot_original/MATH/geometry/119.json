        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Triangle**\nDraw a right triangle ABC with right angle at B.  Label point D on BC.  Since AD is an angle bisector, it divides angle BAC into two congruent angles.\n**2. Use the Angle Bisector Theorem**\nThe Angle Bisector Theorem states that in a triangle, the angle bisector of a vertex divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the lengths of the other two sides.  In our case, this means:\n*  BD / DC = AB / AC\n**3.  Find DC**\nWe know BD = 42 and AB = 105.  We need to find DC to use the Angle Bisector Theorem. \nSince triangle ABC is a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find BC:\n* BC\u00b2 = AB\u00b2 + AC\u00b2\n* BC\u00b2 = 105\u00b2 + AC\u00b2\nAlso, we know that BC = BD + DC.  Substituting the value of BD:\n* BC = 42 + DC\n**4. Solve for AC**\nNow we have two expressions for BC. Let's set them equal to each other:\n* 105\u00b2 + AC\u00b2 = (42 + DC)\u00b2\nWe can substitute DC from the Angle Bisector Theorem:\n* 105\u00b2 + AC\u00b2 = (42 + (42 * AC / 105))\u00b2\nSimplify and solve for AC:\n* 11025 + AC\u00b2 = (42 + (4/5 * AC))\u00b2 \n* 11025 + AC\u00b2 = 1764 + (336/5)AC + (16/25)AC\u00b2\n* (9/25)AC\u00b2 - (336/5)AC + 9261 = 0\nMultiply the equation by 25 to get rid of the fractions:\n* 9AC\u00b2 - 1680AC + 231525 = 0\nThis is a quadratic equation. We can solve it using the quadratic formula:\n* AC = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / 2a\nWhere a = 9, b = -1680, and c = 231525.\nSolve for AC, and you'll find that AC = **105**. \n**Therefore, the length of AC is 105.** \n",

Use the Angle Bisector Theorem to find AC**\nNow we can plug in the values we know into the Angle Bisector Theorem equation:\n*  42/63 = 105/AC\n**5. Solve for AC**\n* Cross-multiply: 42 * AC = 105 * 63\n* Simplify: 42 * AC = 6615\n* Divide both sides by 42: AC = 6615/42 = **157.5**\n**Therefore, AC = 157.5** \n",
