        "Here's how to find the area of the isosceles trapezoid step by step:\n**1. Visualize the Trapezoid**\nDraw a trapezoid with bases of 7 and 17 units. Since it's isosceles, the legs (the non-parallel sides) are equal and 13 units long. \n**2. Divide into Rectangle and Triangles**\n* Draw a perpendicular line from one endpoint of the shorter base to the longer base.  Do the same from the other endpoint of the shorter base. \n* This divides the trapezoid into a rectangle in the middle and two congruent right triangles on the sides.\n**3. Find the Height**\n* The rectangle's height is the same as the trapezoid's height.\n*  The base of each right triangle is half the difference between the two bases of the trapezoid: (17 - 7) / 2 = 5 units.\n*  You have a right triangle with a hypotenuse of 13 and a leg of 5.  Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the other leg (which is the height): \n   *  13\u00b2 = 5\u00b2 + height\u00b2\n   *  169 = 25 + height\u00b2\n   *  144 = height\u00b2\n   *  height = 12 units\n**4. Calculate the Area**\n* The area of a trapezoid is (1/2) * height * (base1 + base2)\n* Area = (1/2) * 12 * (7 + 17)\n* Area = 6 * 24\n* Area = **144 square units** \n",
        "Here's how to find the area of the isosceles trapezoid step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Trapezoid**\nDraw an isosceles trapezoid. Label the longer base 17, the shorter base 7, and each leg 13.\n**2. Divide the Trapezoid**\n* Draw a perpendicular line from each endpoint of the shorter base to the longer base. This divides the trapezoid into a rectangle and two congruent right triangles.\n**3.  Find the Rectangle's Dimensions**\n* The rectangle's width is equal to the length of the shorter base, 7 units.\n* The rectangle's height is the same as the height of the trapezoid (and the triangles).\n**4. Find the Triangle's Dimensions**\n* The base of each triangle is half the difference of the trapezoid's bases: (17 - 7) / 2 = 5 units.\n* The hypotenuse of each triangle is the leg of the trapezoid, 13 units.\n**5. Use the Pythagorean Theorem**\n*  Let the height of the triangle (and the trapezoid) be represented by 'h'.  \n* The Pythagorean theorem states:  a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n* In our triangle:  5\u00b2 + h\u00b2 = 13\u00b2\n* Solve for 'h': 25 + h\u00b2 = 169\n                h\u00b2 = 144\n                h = 12 \n**6. Calculate the Area**\n* Area of a trapezoid = (1/2) * height * (base1 + base2)\n* Area = (1/2) * 12 * (7 + 17)\n* Area = 6 * 24\n* Area = **144 square units** \n",
        "Here's how to find the area of the isosceles trapezoid:\n**1. Visualize the Trapezoid**\nImagine an isosceles trapezoid. The two parallel sides are the bases (7 and 17 units). The two non-parallel sides are the legs (13 units each).\n**2. Divide the Trapezoid**\nDraw a perpendicular line from one endpoint of the shorter base to the longer base.  This creates a rectangle and two right triangles.\n**3. Find the Dimensions of the Rectangle**\n* The rectangle's width is equal to the shorter base (7 units).\n* The rectangle's length is equal to the difference between the longer base and the shorter base, divided by 2.  That's (17 - 7) / 2 = 5 units.\n**4. Find the Dimensions of the Triangles**\n* The triangles are right triangles with legs of 5 units (the length of the rectangle) and  a hypotenuse of 13 units (the leg of the trapezoid).  \n* Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the height of the triangle (and the trapezoid): 13\u00b2 = 5\u00b2 + height\u00b2 \n   * 169 = 25 + height\u00b2\n   * 144 = height\u00b2\n   * height = 12 units\n**5.
