        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Setup**\n* We have a large rectangle divided into five smaller congruent rectangles.  \n* \"Congruent\" means the smaller rectangles are all identical in size and shape.\n* The perimeter of the large rectangle is 176.\n**2. Relate the Perimeters**\n* Let the length of a small rectangle be *l* and the width be *w*.\n* The large rectangle has a length of 3*l* and a width of 2*w.\n*  Perimeter of large rectangle = 2(length + width) = 2(3*l + 2*w) = 176\n**3. Simplify and Solve**\n* Simplify the equation: 6*l + 4*w = 176\n* Divide both sides by 2: 3*l + 2*w = 88\n* We want to find the perimeter of one of the small rectangles, which is 2*l + 2*w.  Notice that this expression appears in the equation we just derived, but multiplied by 2.\n**4. Calculate the Perimeter**\n* Divide both sides of the equation 3*l + 2*w = 88 by 2: (3/2)*l + w = 44 \n* Now we have: 2*( (3/2)*l + w ) = 2 * 44 \n* This simplifies to: 3*l + 2*w = 88  \n* Therefore, the perimeter of one of the small rectangles is **88**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Diagram:**\n* The large rectangle is divided into five smaller, identical rectangles. \n*  Notice that the horizontal and vertical lines create four rows and four columns.\n**2.  Set Up Variables:**\n* Let the width of one of the small rectangles be *w* and the length be *l*.\n**3. Express the Perimeter of the Large Rectangle:**\n* The perimeter of the large rectangle is 176.\n* The large rectangle has a length of 4*l (four small lengths) and a width of 4*w (four small widths). \n* Therefore, the perimeter of the large rectangle is 2(4*l) + 2(4*w) = 176\n**4. Simplify the Equation:**\n* 8l + 8w = 176\n* Divide both sides by 8: l + w = 22\n**5. Find the Perimeter of a Small Rectangle:**\n* The perimeter of one of the smaller rectangles is 2l + 2w.\n* We know l + w = 22, so 2l + 2w = 2(l + w) = 2(22) = **44**\n**Answer:** The perimeter of one of the five congruent rectangles is **44**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step by step:\n**1. Understand the Setup**\n* We have a large rectangle divided into five smaller, congruent rectangles.\n* \"Congruent\" means the smaller rectangles have the same dimensions.\n**2.  Perimeter Relationships**\n* **Large Rectangle:** Let the length of the large rectangle be *L* and the width be *W*.  The perimeter is given as 176: 2*L + 2*W = 176.\n* **Small Rectangle:**  Let the length of a small rectangle be *l* and the width be *w*.  Notice that the length of the large rectangle is made up of three small lengths: L = 3*l.  Similarly, the width of the large rectangle is made up of two small widths: W = 2*w.\n**3. Substitute and Solve**\n* Substitute the relationships for *L* and *W* into the perimeter equation of the large rectangle: \n   2*(3*l) + 2*(2*w) = 176\n* Simplify: 6*l + 4*w = 176\n* Divide both sides by 2: 3*l + 2*w = 88 \n* Now we need to find the perimeter of one small rectangle: 2*l + 2*w\n**4.  Express the Small Perimeter in Terms of the Large Perimeter**\nNotice that the equation we derived (3*l + 2*w = 88) is almost the same as the perimeter of the small rectangle, just multiplied by a factor of 1.5.  To get the perimeter of the small rectangle, divide both sides of the equation by 1.5:\n   (3*l + 2*w) / 1.5 = 88 / 1.5\n   2*l + 2*w = 58.67 (approximately)\n**Answer:** The perimeter of one of the five congruent rectangles is approximately **58.67**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Understand the Setup**\n* We have a large rectangle divided into 5 smaller, identical rectangles.\n* The perimeter of the large rectangle is 176. \n**2.  Find the Dimensions of the Large Rectangle**\n* Let the length of the large rectangle be 'l' and the width be 'w'.\n* We know the perimeter: 2l + 2w = 176\n* Simplifying, we get l + w = 88\n**3. Relate the Large Rectangle to the Smaller Ones**\n* The length of the large rectangle is equal to the combined lengths of three of the smaller rectangles.\n* The width of the large rectangle is equal to the combined widths of two of the smaller rectangles.\n**4. Set Up Equations for the Smaller Rectangles**\n* Let the length of each smaller rectangle be 'x' and the width be 'y'.\n* We have the following relationships:\n    * l = 3x \n    * w = 2y\n**5.  Solve for the Dimensions of the Smaller Rectangle**\n* Substitute the values of 'l' and 'w' from step 4 into the equation from step 2: 3x + 2y = 88 \n* Now we have two equations with two unknowns:\n    * 3x + 2y = 88\n    * l = 3x\n    * w = 2y \n**6. Find the Perimeter of a Smaller Rectangle**\n* Solve the system of equations to find 'x' and 'y'.  You'll find that x = 16 and y = 10.\n* The perimeter of a smaller rectangle is 2x + 2y = 2(16) + 2(10) = **52**\n**Therefore, the perimeter of one of the five congruent rectangles is 52.** \n",
