        "Here's how to figure out the angle of rotation:\n1. **Identify a Corresponding Point:** Choose a point on the darker figure and its corresponding point on the lighter figure.  Let's pick the bottom left corner of each shape.\n2. **Connect the Points:** Draw a line segment connecting these two corresponding points. This line represents the direction of the rotation.\n3. **Center of Rotation:** Since the rotation is about point C, draw a line segment from point C to the corresponding point on the darker figure.  \n4. **Angle Measurement:**  The angle of rotation is the angle between the two line segments you drew. In this case, it's the angle between the line segment connecting the bottom left corners and the line segment connecting point C to the bottom left corner of the darker figure.\n5. **Visual Estimate:** Looking at the diagram, the angle of rotation appears to be close to 90 degrees.  Since the lighter figure appears to be rotated clockwise, the angle of rotation is **-90 degrees**. \n**Important Note:** You can use a protractor to measure the angle more accurately, but a visual estimate is often sufficient to solve this type of problem. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Identify a Corresponding Point**\n* Choose a point on the darker figure. Let's choose the point at the top left corner of the darker figure.\n* Find the corresponding point on the lighter figure (the point that it maps to). This is the top left corner of the lighter figure.\n**2. Draw a Line Segment**\n* Draw a line segment connecting the two corresponding points. \n**3. Bisect the Angle**\n*  The angle of rotation is half of the angle formed by the line segment you drew and the line connecting the center of rotation ($C$) to the original point.  \n* To find the angle, you can use a protractor or reason geometrically. \n**4. Determine the Direction**\n* The direction of rotation is determined by the direction you need to turn the darker figure to match the lighter figure. In this case, the darker figure needs to be rotated counterclockwise to match the lighter figure.\n**Solution**\nThe angle of rotation is **45 degrees counterclockwise** about point $C$. \n**Reasoning**\nThe line segment connecting the corresponding points forms a diagonal of a square with side length 2.  This square has a 45-degree angle at its corners.  Since the line segment is a diagonal of the square, it bisects the 45-degree angle, resulting in a 22.5-degree angle.\nThe angle between the line segment and the line connecting $C$ to the original point is 67.5 degrees (90 degrees - 22.5 degrees).  Therefore, the angle of rotation is half of 67.5 degrees, which is 33.75 degrees.\nHowever, we need to consider the direction of rotation. The darker figure needs to be rotated counterclockwise to match the lighter figure. Therefore, the angle of rotation is **45 degrees counterclockwise**. \n",
        "Here's how to determine the angle of rotation:\n**1.  Identify a Corresponding Point**\n* Choose a point on the darker figure.  Let's use the top vertex on the left side.\n* Find the corresponding point on the lighter figure after the rotation (the same vertex).\n**2.  Connect the Points**\n* Draw a line segment connecting the original point to the corresponding point.\n**3.  Find the Center of Rotation**\n* We are given that the center of rotation is point $C$.\n**4.  Measure the Angle**\n* The angle of rotation is the angle formed by the line segment you drew in step 2 and the line segment connecting the original point to the center of rotation.\n**5.  Determine the Direction**\n* If the rotation is counterclockwise, the angle is positive. If the rotation is clockwise, the angle is negative.\n**In this specific case:**\n* The line segment from the original point to the corresponding point goes straight through point $C$. \n* This means the angle formed is a straight angle, which measures **180 degrees**. \n* Since the darker figure rotates counterclockwise to become the lighter figure, the angle of rotation is **180 degrees**. \n",
        "Here's how to break down the problem to find the angle of rotation:\n1. **Identify a Corresponding Point:**  Choose a point on the darker figure and its corresponding point on the lighter figure.  Let's pick the top vertex of the darker figure and its corresponding point on the lighter figure.\n2. **Connect the Points:** Draw a line segment connecting the two points you chose. This line segment represents the direction of rotation.\n3. **Draw a Line to the Center:** Draw a line segment from the center of rotation, point C, to one of the points you chose (either one will work).\n4. **Measure the Angle:** The angle of rotation is the angle formed between the two line segments you drew. You can measure this angle using a protractor. \n**Here's the catch:** The angle of rotation can be measured in two directions. You need to determine whether the rotation is clockwise or counterclockwise.\n* **Clockwise Rotation:** If the rotation is clockwise, the angle will be positive.\n* **Counterclockwise Rotation:** If the rotation is counterclockwise, the angle will be negative.\n**In this case:**  The rotation appears to be clockwise, and the angle is approximately **60 degrees**. \n**Therefore, the angle of rotation about point C that maps the darker figure to the lighter image is approximately 60 degrees clockwise.** \n",

Let's choose the bottom right vertex of each figure.\n2. **Draw a Line Segment:** Connect these two corresponding points with a line segment. This line segment represents the direction of the rotation.\n3. **Find the Angle:**  Imagine rotating the darker figure about point C until it aligns with the lighter figure. The angle through which you need to rotate is the angle between the line segment you drew and the horizontal axis (or any other convenient reference line).\n[asy]\nimport olympiad; defaultpen(linewidth(0.7));\ndraw((4,-1)--(4,1)--(-4,1)--(-4,3)--(-6,0)--(-4,-3)--(-4,-1)--(4,-1)--cycle,linewidth(2));\ndraw((-4,1)--(-4,3)--(4,3)--(4,5)--(6,2)--(4,-1)--(4,1)--(-4,1)--cycle);\ndot(\"$C$\",(0,1),N);\ndraw((4,-1)--(4,-3),dashed);\ndraw((4,-1)--(4,-3),red,Arrow(6));\nlabel(\"$\\theta$\",(4.2,-2.2),NE,red); \n[/asy]\n**In this case, the angle of rotation is 90 degrees clockwise.** \n"
