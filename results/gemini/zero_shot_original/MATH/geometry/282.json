        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Relationship**\n* **Cylinder:** The cylinder has a base radius (let's call it *r*) and a height (let's call it *h*).\n* **Cone:** The cone shares the same base radius (*r*) and height (*h*) as the cylinder.  \n**2.  Volume Formulas**\n* **Cylinder:**  Volume =  \u03c0 * r\u00b2 * h\n* **Cone:** Volume = (1/3) * \u03c0 * r\u00b2 * h\n**3. Use the Given Information**\n* The cylinder's volume is 72\u03c0 cubic centimeters. So, \u03c0 * r\u00b2 * h = 72\u03c0.\n**4. Find the Volume of the Cone**\nSince the cone shares the same base radius and height as the cylinder, its volume is:\n* Cone volume = (1/3) * \u03c0 * r\u00b2 * h = (1/3) * (72\u03c0) = 24\u03c0 cubic centimeters\n**5. Calculate the Difference**\nThe space inside the cylinder but outside the cone is the difference between their volumes:\n* Cylinder volume - Cone volume = 72\u03c0 - 24\u03c0 = **48\u03c0** cubic centimeters\n**Answer:** The space inside the cylinder but outside the cone is **48\u03c0** cubic centimeters. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Understand the Problem**\nWe have a cone perfectly fitting inside a cylinder.  We know the cylinder's volume, and we want to find the volume of the space *between* the cone and the cylinder.\n**2. Find the Cylinder's Dimensions**\n* The volume of a cylinder is  \u03c0 * (radius)\u00b2 * height.\n* We're given the volume is 72\u03c0 cubic centimeters.  Let's represent the cylinder's radius as *r* and its height as *h*.  This gives us the equation: \n   \u03c0 * r\u00b2 * h = 72\u03c0\n* Simplifying, we have r\u00b2 * h = 72\n**3. Relate Cone and Cylinder Dimensions**\n* Since the cone is inscribed in the cylinder, they share the same radius (r) and the cone's height is also the cylinder's height (h).\n**4. Calculate the Cone's Volume**\n* The volume of a cone is (1/3) * \u03c0 * (radius)\u00b2 * height.\n* Using our variables, the cone's volume is (1/3) * \u03c0 * r\u00b2 * h.\n**5. Find the Difference in Volumes**\n* The volume of the space between the cone and cylinder is the cylinder's volume minus the cone's volume.\n* This difference is:  \u03c0 * r\u00b2 * h  -  (1/3) * \u03c0 * r\u00b2 * h \n* Simplifying: (2/3) * \u03c0 * r\u00b2 * h\n**6. Substitute to Find the Answer**\n* We know r\u00b2 * h = 72 \n* Substitute: (2/3) * \u03c0 * (72) = **48\u03c0** cubic centimeters.\n**Therefore, the volume of the space inside the cylinder but outside the cone is 48\u03c0 cubic centimeters.** \n",

The cone's base perfectly fits within the cylinder's base, and the cone's vertex touches the cylinder's top. \n**2.  Find the Cylinder's Dimensions**\n* The volume of a cylinder is given by  $V_{cylinder} = \\pi r^2 h$, where *r* is the radius and *h* is the height.\n* We know $V_{cylinder} = 72\\pi$.  Let's find *r* and *h*.  We can't solve for both directly, but we can express one in terms of the other.  Let's solve for *h*: \n   * $72\\pi = \\pi r^2 h$\n   * $h = \\frac{72\\pi}{\\pi r^2} = \\frac{72}{r^2}$\n**3.  Find the Cone's Volume**\n* The volume of a cone is given by $V_{cone} = \\frac{1}{3}\\pi r^2 h$.\n* Since the cone is inscribed in the cylinder, it has the same radius (*r*) and height (*h*).  \n* Substitute the expression we found for *h* from the cylinder's volume:\n   * $V_{cone} = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 \\left(\\frac{72}{r^2}\\right) = 24\\pi$\n**4.
