        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Find the base of the triangle:**\n* The base of the isosceles triangle is  BC, which has a length of 20 (from the coordinates of B and C).\n**2. Find the height of the triangle:**\n* The area of a triangle is (1/2) * base * height.\n* We know the area is 240 and the base is 20.\n*  240 = (1/2) * 20 * height\n*  240 = 10 * height\n*  height = 24\n**3. Understand the height:**\n* The height of an isosceles triangle drawn from the vertex (A) to the base bisects the base.  \n* This means the height line goes through point A and the midpoint of BC, which has an x-coordinate of 10.\n**4. Determine the y-coordinate of A:**\n* Since the height of the triangle is 24, and the y-coordinate of point B is 0, the y-coordinate of point A must be 24.\n**Answer:** The y-coordinate of point A is **24**. \n",
