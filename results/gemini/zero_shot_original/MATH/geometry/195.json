        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Recognize the Key Property**\nThe key to solving this problem is recognizing that the median from the vertex of a triangle to the midpoint of the opposite side divides the triangle into two triangles with equal areas.\n**2. Apply the Area Formula**\n* Let's denote the area of triangle $ABC$ as  [ABC].\n* Let's denote the area of triangle $ACM$ as [ACM].\n* Let's denote the area of triangle $BCM$ as [BCM].\nWe know that [ACM] = [BCM] since $M$ is the midpoint of $AB$.  Also, [ABC] = [ACM] + [BCM]. Therefore, [ACM] = [BCM] = \u00bd [ABC].\nNow, let's use the area formula:\n* [ABC] = (1/2) * base * height \n* We can use $BC$ as the base of triangle $ABC$, but we need to find the height.  Let's call the height $h$.\n**3.  Find the Height**\nTo find the height, we can use the Pythagorean theorem on right triangle $BCH$, where $H$ is the foot of the altitude from $C$ to $AB$.\n* $BC^2 = BH^2 + CH^2$ \n* $15^2 = BH^2 + h^2$\n* Since $M$ is the midpoint of $AB$, we know $BH = AB/2 = 8/2 = 4$.\n* Substitute to find $h$:  $15^2 = 4^2 + h^2$\n* Solve for $h$: $h = \\sqrt{15^2 - 4^2} = \\sqrt{209}$\n**4.  Find the Area of Triangle ABC**\nNow we can find the area of triangle ABC:\n* [ABC] = (1/2) * BC * h = (1/2) * 15 * \u221a209 = (15/2)\u221a209\n**5. Find the Area of Triangle ACM**\nSince [ACM] = \u00bd [ABC], we have:\n* [ACM] = (1/2) * (15/2)\u221a209 = (15/4)\u221a209\n**6.  Use the Area Formula Again**\nNow, consider triangle $ACM$.  We can use $AC$ as the base and find the height:\n* [ACM] = (1/2) * AC * height\n* (15/4)\u221a209 = (1/2) * 17 * height\n* Solve for the height: height = (15/4)\u221a209 / (17/2) = (15/34)\u221a209\n**7. Apply the Pythagorean Theorem**\nFinally, we can use the Pythagorean theorem on right triangle $ACM$ to find $CM$:\n* $CM^2 = AC^2 - height^2$\n* $CM^2 = 17^2 - ((15/34)\u221a209)^2$\n* $CM^2 = 289 - (225/1156) * 209$\n* $CM^2 = (333141 - 47025)/1156 = 286116/1156 = 247.5$\n**8. Find CM**\nTherefore, $CM = \\sqrt{247.5} = \\boxed{15.73}$ (approximately). \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem:\n**1.  Recognize the Type of Triangle**\nNotice that $17^2 = 15^2 + 8^2$.  This means that triangle $ABC$ is a right triangle with right angle at $B$.\n**2.  Draw a Diagram**\nDraw triangle $ABC$ with right angle at $B$, and label the sides with their lengths.  Mark the midpoint $M$ on segment $AB$.\n**3.  Consider the Median**\nSegment $CM$ is a median of triangle $ABC$ because it connects a vertex ($C$) to the midpoint ($M$) of the opposite side ($AB$).\n**4.  Use the Median Property**\nThe median of a right triangle drawn from the right angle vertex to the hypotenuse is half the length of the hypotenuse.  \n**5.  Apply the Property**\nTherefore, $CM = \\frac{1}{2} AB = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 8 = \\boxed{4}$. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Recognize the Special Triangle**\nNotice that the side lengths 8, 15, and 17 form a Pythagorean triple.  This means that triangle $ABC$ is a right triangle, with the right angle at $B$.\n**2. Draw a Diagram**\nDraw a diagram of triangle $ABC$ with the right angle at $B$, and label the midpoint of $AB$ as $M$.\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.6cm);\npair A,B,C,M;\nA=(0,0);\nB=(8,0);\nC=(0,15);\nM=(A+B)/2;\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(C--M);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,SW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,SE);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,N);\nlabel(\"$M$\",M,S);\nlabel(\"$8$\",(A+B)/2,S);\nlabel(\"$15$\",(B+C)/2,E);\nlabel(\"$17$\",(A+C)/2,W);\n[/asy]\n**3. Apply the Pythagorean Theorem**\nSince $ABC$ is a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of $BC$:\n$AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2$\n$17^2 = 8^2 + BC^2$\n$289 = 64 + BC^2$\n$225 = BC^2$\n$BC = 15$\n**4. Use the Midpoint Property**\nSince $M$ is the midpoint of $AB$, we know that $AM = MB = \\frac{1}{2}AB = 4$.\n**5. Apply the Pythagorean Theorem Again**\nTriangle $CMB$ is a right triangle (with the right angle at $B$).  We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find $CM$:\n$CM^2 = MB^2 + BC^2$\n$CM^2 = 4^2 + 15^2$\n$CM^2 = 16 + 225$\n$CM^2 = 241$\n$CM = \\sqrt{241}$\n**Therefore, the length of $CM$ is $\\sqrt{241}$.** \n",
        "### Response:\n1. **Draw a Diagram:**  Always start by drawing a diagram to visualize the problem. Draw triangle ABC with the given side lengths. Mark point M as the midpoint of AB.\n2. **Apply the Median Theorem:** The Median Theorem states that the length of the median from a vertex of a triangle to the midpoint of the opposite side is half the length of the third side. In our case, CM is the median from C to the midpoint of AB.\n3. **Calculate CM:**  According to the Median Theorem, $CM = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot AB = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 8 = \\boxed{4}$. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Recognize the Key Property**\n* Since $M$ is the midpoint of $AB$, we know that $AM = MB = AB/2 = 4$.\n**2. Consider the Triangle**\n* We have triangle $\\triangle CMB$ with sides $CM$, $MB = 4$, and $BC = 15$.\n**3. Apply the Law of Cosines**\n* The Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides of length $a$, $b$, and $c$, and angle $C$ opposite side $c$, we have: \n  *  $c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \\cos C$\n* Let's apply this to triangle $\\triangle CMB$:\n    * $CM^2 = MB^2 + BC^2 - 2(MB)(BC) \\cos \\angle MCB$\n**4. Find the Missing Angle**\n*  To find $\\cos \\angle MCB$, we can use the Law of Cosines again, this time on triangle $\\triangle ABC$:\n    * $AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2 - 2(AB)(BC) \\cos \\angle ABC$\n    * $17^2 = 8^2 + 15^2 - 2(8)(15) \\cos \\angle ABC$\n    * Solving for $\\cos \\angle ABC$, we get $\\cos \\angle ABC = -\\frac{1}{5}$.\n* Notice that $\\angle MCB = \\angle ABC$ (they are the same angle), so $\\cos \\angle MCB = -\\frac{1}{5}$.\n**5. Solve for CM**\n* Now we can plug everything back into the equation from step 3:\n    * $CM^2 = 4^2 + 15^2 - 2(4)(15)(-\\frac{1}{5})$\n    * $CM^2 = 289$\n    * $CM = \\sqrt{289} = \\boxed{17}$ \n**Therefore, the length of CM is 17.** \n"
