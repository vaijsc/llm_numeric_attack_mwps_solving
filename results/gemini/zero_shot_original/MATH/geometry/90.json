    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "When the point $(0,0)$ is reflected across the line $x=1$, it is reflected to point $(2,0)$ since the horizontal distance between the original point and the line is $1$. If we reflect the new point $(2,0)$ across the line $y=2$, the vertical distance between the point and the line is $2$, so the coordinates of the resulting point are $\\boxed{(2,4)}$.",

        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**Step 1: Reflection across x = 1**\n* The point (0, 0) is 1 unit to the left of the vertical line x = 1.\n* To reflect across this line, we move the point 1 unit to the right. \n* This gives us the point (2, 0).\n**Step 2: Reflection across y = 2**\n* The point (2, 0) is 2 units below the horizontal line y = 2.\n* To reflect across this line, we move the point 2 units upward.\n* This gives us the point **(2, 4)**.\n**Therefore, the resulting point after the two reflections is (2, 4).** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**Step 1: Reflection across the vertical line x = 1**\n* **Understanding the reflection:** When a point is reflected across a vertical line, its x-coordinate changes while its y-coordinate stays the same. The distance from the point to the line is the same as the distance from the image point to the line.\n* **Applying to our point:** The point (0, 0) is 1 unit to the left of the line x = 1.  Therefore, its reflection will be 1 unit to the right of the line x = 1.  This gives us the point (2, 0).\n**Step 2: Reflection across the horizontal line y = 2**\n* **Understanding the reflection:** When a point is reflected across a horizontal line, its y-coordinate changes while its x-coordinate stays the same. The distance from the point to the line is the same as the distance from the image point to the line.\n* **Applying to our point:** The point (2, 0) is 2 units below the line y = 2. Therefore, its reflection will be 2 units above the line y = 2. This gives us the point (2, 4).\n**Final answer:** The coordinates of the resulting point are **(2, 4)**. \n",
