        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Draw a Diagram**\nDraw a circle with an isosceles triangle inscribed inside.  Label the vertices of the triangle A, B, and C, with the base being BC.  Let the center of the circle be O. Draw radii from the center of the circle to each vertex of the triangle. \n**2.  Identify Key Relationships**\n* **Isosceles Triangle:**  Triangle ABC has AB = AC = 5 inches and BC = 6 inches.\n* **Circle Properties:** The radii of the circle are all equal (OA = OB = OC).\n* **Perpendicular Bisector:**  The altitude from A to BC (let's call the point of intersection D) bisects BC, creating two right triangles (ADB and ADC).\n**3.  Solve for the Altitude**\n* **Right Triangle:**  Triangle ADB is a right triangle with hypotenuse AB = 5 inches and base BD = 3 inches.\n* **Pythagorean Theorem:**  Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the altitude AD:  AD\u00b2 = AB\u00b2 - BD\u00b2 = 5\u00b2 - 3\u00b2 = 16.  Therefore, AD = 4 inches.\n**4.  Find the Radius**\n* **Right Triangle:** Triangle ODB is a right triangle with hypotenuse OB (the radius) and base BD = 3 inches.  The altitude OD is half the altitude of the isosceles triangle (AD/2 = 2 inches).\n* **Pythagorean Theorem:** Use the Pythagorean theorem to find OB (the radius): OB\u00b2 = OD\u00b2 + BD\u00b2 = 2\u00b2 + 3\u00b2 = 13.  Therefore, OB = \u221a13 inches.\n**5.  Express the Answer as a Mixed Number**\n\u221a13 is a bit more than 3 (since 3\u00b2 = 9).  The radius is approximately 3.6 inches.  To express this as a mixed number, we can write it as **3 3/5 inches**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Problem**\nDraw a circle with an isosceles triangle inscribed inside. The base of the triangle is a chord of the circle, and the two equal sides are also chords of the circle.\n**2. Draw Perpendiculars**\nDraw a perpendicular line from the center of the circle to the base of the triangle. This line will bisect the base and be a radius of the circle.  Let's call the center of the circle O, the midpoint of the base M, and one of the vertices of the triangle A.\n**3.  Recognize Right Triangles**\nWe now have a right triangle OMA.  The hypotenuse of this right triangle is one of the equal sides of the isosceles triangle (OA = 5 inches), and OM is a radius of the circle (which we want to find). The length of AM is half the length of the base, so AM = 3 inches.\n**4. Use the Pythagorean Theorem**\nThe Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. Applying this to triangle OMA, we have:\n* OA\u00b2 = OM\u00b2 + AM\u00b2\n* 5\u00b2 = OM\u00b2 + 3\u00b2\n* 25 = OM\u00b2 + 9\n* 16 = OM\u00b2\n**5. Solve for the Radius**\nTaking the square root of both sides, we find:\n* OM = \u221a16 = 4 inches\n**Therefore, the radius of the circle is 4 inches.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Draw a Diagram**\nDraw a circle with an isosceles triangle inscribed inside.  Label the vertices of the triangle A, B, and C, with AB and AC being the equal sides of length 5 inches, and BC being the base of length 6 inches.  Draw a line segment from the center of the circle (O) to the midpoint of the base (D).\n**2. Key Properties**\n* **Isosceles Triangle:**  The altitude from the vertex A to the base BC bisects the base (BD = DC = 3 inches).\n* **Circle Property:**  A line segment from the center of a circle to the midpoint of a chord is perpendicular to the chord.  Therefore,  OD is perpendicular to BC.\n**3. Right Triangle**\nTriangle AOD is a right triangle with:\n*  AD = 3 inches (half the base)\n*  AO = the radius of the circle (let's call it 'r')\n*  Hypotenuse =  5 inches (one of the equal sides of the isosceles triangle)\n**4. Pythagorean Theorem**\nApply the Pythagorean theorem to triangle AOD:\n*  AD\u00b2 + OD\u00b2 = AO\u00b2\n*  3\u00b2 + r\u00b2 = 5\u00b2\n*  9 + r\u00b2 = 25\n*  r\u00b2 = 16\n*  r = 4 inches\n**Answer:** The radius of the circle is **4 inches**. \n",

Label the vertices of the triangle A, B, and C, with AB and AC being the equal sides of length 5 inches and BC being the base of length 6 inches.\n**2.  Find the Circumcenter:**\nThe circumcenter of a triangle is the point where the perpendicular bisectors of the sides intersect.  In an isosceles triangle, the circumcenter lies on the altitude drawn from the vertex angle to the base.\n**3.  Divide the Triangle:**\nDraw the altitude from vertex A to base BC. This altitude will bisect BC, creating two right triangles (let's call the point where the altitude intersects BC point D).  \n*  BD = DC = 3 inches. \n*  AD is the height of the triangle.\n**4.  Use the Pythagorean Theorem:**\nIn right triangle ABD, we have:\n* AB = 5 inches (hypotenuse)\n* BD = 3 inches (leg)\nUsing the Pythagorean Theorem:\n*  AD\u00b2 + BD\u00b2 = AB\u00b2\n*  AD\u00b2 + 3\u00b2 = 5\u00b2\n*  AD\u00b2 = 16\n*  AD = 4 inches\n**5.  Radius of the Circle:**\nThe radius of the circle is the distance from the circumcenter (which is on the altitude AD) to any vertex of the triangle.  Since the circumcenter lies on the altitude and the altitude has length 4 inches, the radius of the circle is **4 inches**.\n**Answer:** The radius of the circle is **4 inches**. \n",

Label the equal sides of the triangle as 5 inches and the base as 6 inches. Draw a line segment from the center of the circle to the midpoint of the base of the triangle. This line segment will be a radius of the circle and will also be perpendicular to the base of the triangle.\n**2. Use the Pythagorean Theorem**\n*  The line segment from the center of the circle to the midpoint of the base divides the isosceles triangle into two right triangles.\n*  The hypotenuse of each right triangle is one of the equal sides of the isosceles triangle (5 inches).\n*  One leg of each right triangle is half the base of the isosceles triangle (3 inches).\n*  Let the radius of the circle be *r*.  The other leg of each right triangle is *r*.\nNow, use the Pythagorean Theorem:\n*  *r*\u00b2 + 3\u00b2 = 5\u00b2\n*  *r*\u00b2 + 9 = 25\n*  *r*\u00b2 = 16\n*  *r* = 4\n**3.
