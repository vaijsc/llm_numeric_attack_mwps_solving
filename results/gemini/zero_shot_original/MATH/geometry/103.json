Area Ratios**\n* Because of the similarity, the ratio of the areas of these triangles is equal to the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. \n* Since $AG$ is two-thirds of $AD$, we have:\n    *  [Area of $AGM$]/[Area of $ABC$] = (AG/AD)^2 = (2/3)^2 = 4/9\n    *  [Area of $AGN$]/[Area of $ABC$] = (AG/AD)^2 = (2/3)^2 = 4/9\n**4.
