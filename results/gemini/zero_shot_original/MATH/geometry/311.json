    "solution": "Because of our parallel bases, we can see that corresponding angles of the triangles must be congruent. Therefore, by AA similarity, we see that the two triangles are similar.\n\nIf two similar triangles have side ratios of $r : 1,$ the ratio of their areas must be $r^2 : 1.$ In our diagram, we see that the ratio of the sides of the smaller triangle to the sides of the larger triangle is $\\dfrac{4\\text{ cm}}{10\\text{ cm}} = \\dfrac{2}{5}.$ Therefore, the ratio of the areas is the square of that, or $\\left(\\dfrac{2}{5}\\right)^2 = \\boxed{\\dfrac{4}{25}}.$",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Relationship**\n* **Similar Triangles:** When triangles have parallel bases, they are similar.  This means their corresponding angles are equal, and their corresponding sides are proportional.\n**2.  Find the Scale Factor**\n* The larger triangle's base is 10 cm, and the smaller triangle's base is 4 cm.  The scale factor between the triangles is 10/4 = 5/2.  This means every side of the larger triangle is 5/2 times larger than the corresponding side of the smaller triangle.\n**3.  Area Ratio**\n* **Area is proportional to the square of the side length.** Since the side lengths are in a ratio of 5/2, the areas are in a ratio of (5/2)^2 = 25/4.\n**4.
