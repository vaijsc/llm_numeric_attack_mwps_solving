        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Situation**\nImagine rotating the right triangle around one of its legs. This will create a cone.  The leg you rotate around becomes the cone's height, and the other leg becomes the cone's radius.\n**2. Determine the Maximum Volume**\nTo maximize the volume of the cone, you want to rotate the triangle around the longer leg. This is because the volume of a cone is given by:\n  * **Volume = (1/3)\u03c0r\u00b2h**\nWhere:\n   * r = radius of the base\n   * h = height of the cone\nBy rotating around the longer leg, you maximize the radius, which in turn maximizes the volume.\n**3. Assign Values**\n*  **Height (h):** 15 cm (the longer leg)\n* **Radius (r):** 8 cm (the shorter leg)\n**4. Calculate the Volume**\nSubstitute the values into the volume formula:\n  * **Volume = (1/3)\u03c0(8\u00b2)(15)**\n  * **Volume = (1/3)\u03c0(64)(15)**\n  * **Volume = 320\u03c0 cubic centimeters**\n**Answer:** The maximum possible volume of the resulting solid is **320\u03c0** cubic centimeters. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Solid**\nWhen you rotate a right triangle about one of its legs, you create a cone. \n**2. Determine the Dimensions**\n* **Radius (r):**  The radius of the cone's base is the length of the leg *not* used as the axis of rotation.  In this case, the radius is either 8 cm or 15 cm.\n* **Height (h):** The height of the cone is the length of the leg used as the axis of rotation.  Again, this is either 8 cm or 15 cm.\n**3. Maximize the Volume**\nThe volume of a cone is given by: \n  *  V = (1/3)\u03c0r\u00b2h\nTo maximize the volume, we want the largest possible radius and height. This means we should rotate the triangle about the **longer** leg (15 cm).\n**4. Calculate the Volume**\n* **r = 8 cm** (shorter leg)\n* **h = 15 cm** (longer leg)\nSubstitute these values into the volume formula:\n  * V = (1/3)\u03c0(8\u00b2)(15) \n  * V = (1/3)\u03c0(64)(15)\n  * V = **320\u03c0 cubic centimeters**\n**Therefore, the maximum possible volume of the resulting solid is 320\u03c0 cubic centimeters.** \n",
