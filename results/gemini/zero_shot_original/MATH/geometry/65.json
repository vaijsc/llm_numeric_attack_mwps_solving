        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Problem**\nWe need to find the area of the region in the first quadrant where point C can be located so that triangle ABC is acute.  This means all three angles of the triangle must be less than 90 degrees.\n**2. Analyze the Conditions for an Acute Triangle**\n* **Law of Cosines:**  For a triangle with sides of length *a*, *b*, and *c*, and angle *C* opposite side *c*, the Law of Cosines states:\n   *c\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - 2ab cos(C)*\n* **Acute Triangle Condition:**  For angle *C* to be acute (less than 90 degrees), *cos(C)* must be positive. This means:\n   * a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 > c\u00b2  (The sum of the squares of the two shorter sides must be greater than the square of the longest side)\n**3. Apply the Condition to Triangle ABC**\nLet's denote the coordinates of point C as (x, y).  Then we have:\n* **Side AB:** Length = \u221a((7-2)\u00b2 + (7-2)\u00b2) = \u221a50\n* **Side AC:** Length = \u221a((x-2)\u00b2 + (y-2)\u00b2)\n* **Side BC:** Length = \u221a((x-7)\u00b2 + (y-7)\u00b2)\nTo ensure triangle ABC is acute, we need to satisfy the following inequalities:\n* **AB\u00b2 + AC\u00b2 > BC\u00b2**\n* **AB\u00b2 + BC\u00b2 > AC\u00b2**\n* **AC\u00b2 + BC\u00b2 > AB\u00b2**\n**4. Simplify the Inequalities**\n* **Inequality 1:**  50 + (x-2)\u00b2 + (y-2)\u00b2 > (x-7)\u00b2 + (y-7)\u00b2 \n   * Simplifying, we get:  x + y > 6\n* **Inequality 2:**  50 + (x-7)\u00b2 + (y-7)\u00b2 > (x-2)\u00b2 + (y-2)\u00b2\n   * Simplifying, we get:  x + y < 12\n* **Inequality 3:**  (x-2)\u00b2 + (y-2)\u00b2 + (x-7)\u00b2 + (y-7)\u00b2 > 50\n   * Simplifying, we get:  x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - 9x - 9y + 18 > 0\n**5. Visualize the Solution**\nThe inequalities x + y > 6 and x + y < 12 represent the region between two parallel lines with slopes of -1. The inequality x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - 9x - 9y + 18 > 0 represents the exterior of a circle (you can find the center and radius by completing the square).\n**6. Determine the Region R**\n* The region satisfying all three inequalities is the area in the first quadrant between the lines x + y = 6 and x + y = 12, and outside the circle. \n**7. Calculate the Area of Region R**\n* **Area of the Parallelogram:**  The parallelogram formed by the lines x + y = 6, x + y = 12, x = 0, and y = 0 has a base of 6 and a height of 6, so its area is 36.\n* **Area of the Circle Sector:**  Complete the square in the inequality x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - 9x - 9y + 18 > 0 to find the equation of the circle: (x-4.5)\u00b2 + (y-4.5)\u00b2 > 20.25. The radius of the circle is 4.5. The sector of the circle in the first quadrant has an angle of 90 degrees (\u03c0/2 radians), so its area is (1/4)\u03c0(4.5)\u00b2 = (81/16)\u03c0.\n* **Area of Region R:**  Subtract the circle sector area from the parallelogram area: 36 - (81/16)\u03c0.\n**Therefore, the area of region R is 36 - (81/16)\u03c0.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step by step:\n**1. Understand the Problem**\nWe need to find all the points in the first quadrant that, when connected to points A and B, form an acute triangle.  An acute triangle has all three angles less than 90 degrees.\n**2. Visualize the Situation**\n* Plot points A(2,2) and B(7,7) on a coordinate plane.\n*  Draw a line segment connecting A and B.  This line segment is the hypotenuse of all possible triangles we'll consider.\n**3. Consider the Conditions for an Acute Triangle**\nFor triangle ABC to be acute, the following must be true:\n* **Angle CAB is acute:** This means point C must lie *above* the line perpendicular to AB passing through point A.\n* **Angle CBA is acute:** This means point C must lie *below* the line perpendicular to AB passing through point B. \n**4. Determine the Equations of the Perpendicular Lines**\n* **Line through A perpendicular to AB:** The slope of AB is (7-2)/(7-2) = 1.  The perpendicular slope is -1.  Using point-slope form, the equation of this line is: \n   y - 2 = -1(x - 2)  =>  y = -x + 4\n* **Line through B perpendicular to AB:** Using the same process, the equation of this line is:\n   y - 7 = -1(x - 7) => y = -x + 14\n**5. Sketch the Region R**\n* On your coordinate plane, draw the lines y = -x + 4 and y = -x + 14.\n*  The region R is the area in the first quadrant *between* these two lines.\n**6. Calculate the Area of Region R**\n* **Find the x-intercepts:**  The x-intercept of y = -x + 4 is (4,0). The x-intercept of y = -x + 14 is (14,0).\n* **Calculate the area of the trapezoid:** The height of the trapezoid is 4 (the vertical distance between the two lines).  The bases are 4 and 14 (the x-intercepts).\n* **Area of trapezoid:**  (1/2) * height * (base1 + base2) = (1/2) * 4 * (4 + 14) = **36 square units**\n**Therefore, the area of region R is 36 square units.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand Acute Triangles**\nAn acute triangle has all three angles less than 90 degrees.  \n**2. Consider the Angles of Triangle ABC**\n* **Angle BAC:**  To make this angle acute, point C must lie below the line perpendicular to AB passing through A. This line has a slope of 1 (since AB has a slope of 1) and passes through (2,2), so its equation is y = x. \n* **Angle ABC:**  Similarly, to make this angle acute, point C must lie above the line perpendicular to AB passing through B. This line has a slope of 1 and passes through (7,7), so its equation is y = x.\n* **Angle ACB:** This is the tricky one. To make this angle acute, point C must lie *outside* of the circle centered at A with radius AB and outside of the circle centered at B with radius AB.\n**3. Visualize the Region**\n* The lines y = x and y = x create a \"wedge\" in the first quadrant.\n* The circles centered at A and B with radius AB create two \"bumps\" inside the wedge. \n**4.  Finding the Area**\n* **Area of the Wedge:** The wedge is a right triangle with legs of length 5 (the distance between A and B).  Therefore, its area is (1/2)(5)(5) = 12.5.\n* **Area of the Bumps:** Each circle has a radius of  \u221a(5\u00b2 + 5\u00b2) = 5\u221a2. The area of each circle is (\u03c0)(5\u221a2)\u00b2 = 50\u03c0.  Since we only care about the portion of the circle in the first quadrant, the area of each bump is (1/4)(50\u03c0) = 12.5\u03c0.\n* **Area of R:** The area of R is the area of the wedge minus the area of the two bumps: 12.5 - 2(12.5\u03c0) = **12.5(1 - 2\u03c0)**.\n**Therefore, the area of region R is 12.5(1 - 2\u03c0).** \n",
        "Here's a step-by-step solution to find the area of region R:\n**1. Understanding Acute Triangles**\nAn acute triangle has all three angles less than 90 degrees.  To ensure triangle ABC is acute, we need to consider the following:\n* **Angle BAC:**  Angle BAC will be acute if point C lies above the line perpendicular to AB passing through point A.\n* **Angle ABC:** Angle ABC will be acute if point C lies below the line perpendicular to AB passing through point B.\n* **Angle ACB:**  This angle is more challenging to directly analyze. However, if both angle BAC and ABC are acute, then ACB must also be acute (since the angles of a triangle sum to 180 degrees).\n**2. Finding the Perpendicular Lines**\n* **Line perpendicular to AB through A:**\n    * The slope of AB is (7-2)/(7-2) = 1.\n    * The slope of a line perpendicular to AB is -1.\n    * Using the point-slope form, the equation of this line is: y - 2 = -1(x - 2)  =>  y = -x + 4\n* **Line perpendicular to AB through B:**\n    * Using the point-slope form with the perpendicular slope of -1: y - 7 = -1(x - 7) => y = -x + 14\n**3. Visualizing the Region R**\n* Plot points A and B, and the two perpendicular lines.\n* Region R is the area in the first quadrant that lies:\n    * Above the line y = -x + 4\n    * Below the line y = -x + 14\n    * Within the first quadrant (x > 0, y > 0)\n**4. Finding the Intersection Points**\n* The line y = -x + 4 intersects the y-axis (x = 0) at the point (0, 4).\n* The line y = -x + 14 intersects the y-axis (x = 0) at the point (0, 14).\n* The two perpendicular lines intersect when: -x + 4 = -x + 14. This equation has no solution, meaning the lines do not intersect.\n**5. Calculating the Area**\n* Region R is a trapezoid with bases of length 4 and 14, and a height of 10 (the vertical distance between the two lines).\n* The area of a trapezoid is (1/2) * height * (base1 + base2).\n* Area of R = (1/2) * 10 * (4 + 14) = **90 square units**\n**Therefore, the area of region R is 90 square units.** \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understanding the Conditions**\n* **Acute Triangle:**  A triangle is acute if all three of its angles are less than 90 degrees. \n* **First Quadrant:**  The first quadrant of the coordinate plane is where both the x-coordinate and y-coordinate are positive.\n**2. Analyzing the Constraints**\nTo make triangle ABC acute, we need to ensure that the angle at C is less than 90 degrees. Let's consider the possible scenarios:\n* **Scenario 1:  Angle BAC is obtuse**  If angle BAC is obtuse, then angle BCA must be acute (since the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees). In this case, any point C in the first quadrant will satisfy the condition.\n* **Scenario 2: Angle ABC is obtuse** If angle ABC is obtuse, then angle ACB must be acute. This means point C must lie on a specific region below the line passing through A and B.\n* **Scenario 3:  Angles BAC and ABC are both acute**  This scenario is the trickiest. We need to find the region where point C can lie so that both angles BAC and ABC are less than 90 degrees.\n**3. Finding the Boundary Lines**\nTo determine the boundaries of region R, let's focus on Scenario 3:\n* **Line perpendicular to AB passing through A:**  If point C lies on this line, then angle BAC will be 90 degrees. This line will form one boundary of region R.\n* **Line perpendicular to AB passing through B:** If point C lies on this line, then angle ABC will be 90 degrees. This line will form another boundary of region R.\n**4. Determining the Region R**\n* **Region R is the area between the two perpendicular lines described above, within the first quadrant.** This is because if C lies within this region, both angles BAC and ABC will be less than 90 degrees, making triangle ABC acute.\n**5. Finding the Area**\n* **Calculate the slope of AB:** The slope of AB is (7-2)/(7-2) = 1.\n* **Calculate the slopes of the perpendicular lines:** The slopes of the perpendicular lines are -1 (negative reciprocal of 1).\n* **Find the equations of the perpendicular lines:** \n    * Line through A (2,2): y - 2 = -1(x - 2)  =>  y = -x + 4\n    * Line through B (7,7): y - 7 = -1(x - 7)  =>  y = -x + 14\n* **Find the intersection points of these lines with the coordinate axes:**\n    * Line y = -x + 4 intersects the x-axis at (4,0) and the y-axis at (0,4).\n    * Line y = -x + 14 intersects the x-axis at (14,0) and the y-axis at (0,14).\n**6. Calculating the Area**\nRegion R is a trapezoid with bases of length 4 and 14, and a height of 10 (the distance between the parallel lines).\nArea of trapezoid = (1/2) * (base1 + base2) * height = (1/2) * (4 + 14) * 10 = **90 square units**.\n**Therefore, the area of region R is 90 square units.** \n"
