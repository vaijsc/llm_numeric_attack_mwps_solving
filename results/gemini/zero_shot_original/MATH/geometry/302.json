        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand Altitudes**\n* An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular segment from a vertex to the opposite side. \n* Since $\\overline{AD}$ and $\\overline{BE}$ are altitudes, we know that $\\angle ADB = \\angle BEC = 90^\\circ$.\n**2.  Focus on Triangle ABH**\n* We want to find $\\angle AHB$.  Let's focus on triangle $ABH$. \n**3. Find the Angles of Triangle ABH**\n*  We know $\\angle BAD = 90^\\circ - \\angle BAC = 90^\\circ - 54^\\circ = 36^\\circ$.\n*  Similarly, $\\angle ABE = 90^\\circ - \\angle ABC = 90^\\circ - 52^\\circ = 38^\\circ$.\n*  The angles of triangle $ABH$ are: $\\angle BAH = 36^\\circ$, $\\angle ABH = 38^\\circ$, and $\\angle AHB$ (which we want to find).\n**4. Use the Angle Sum Property**\n* The angles of any triangle add up to $180^\\circ$.  Therefore, in triangle $ABH$:\n   $\\angle BAH + \\angle ABH + \\angle AHB = 180^\\circ$\n* Substitute the known angle measures:\n   $36^\\circ + 38^\\circ + \\angle AHB = 180^\\circ$\n**5. Solve for $\\angle AHB$**\n* Combine the known angles: $74^\\circ + \\angle AHB = 180^\\circ$\n* Subtract $74^\\circ$ from both sides:  $\\angle AHB = 106^\\circ$\n**Therefore, $\\angle AHB = 106^\\circ$.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Understanding Altitudes**\n* An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular segment from a vertex to the opposite side (or its extension). \n* Since $\\overline{AD}$ and $\\overline{BE}$ are altitudes, we know that $\\angle ADB = \\angle BEC = 90^\\circ$.\n**2.  Angles in a Triangle**\n* The angles inside any triangle add up to 180 degrees. \n**3.  Finding Angles in Triangle ABD**\n* In $\\triangle ABD$, we know:\n    * $\\angle ADB = 90^\\circ$ \n    * $\\angle BAD = \\angle BAC = 54^\\circ$ \n* Therefore, $\\angle ABD = 180^\\circ - 90^\\circ - 54^\\circ = 36^\\circ$\n**4.  Finding Angles in Triangle BCE**\n* In $\\triangle BCE$, we know:\n    * $\\angle BEC = 90^\\circ$\n    * $\\angle CBE = \\angle ABC = 52^\\circ$\n* Therefore, $\\angle BCE = 180^\\circ - 90^\\circ - 52^\\circ = 38^\\circ$\n**5.  Angles in Quadrilateral ABHE**\n* Now, consider quadrilateral $ABHE$.  We know:\n    * $\\angle BAD = 54^\\circ$\n    * $\\angle ABE = 52^\\circ$\n    * $\\angle AHB$ is what we want to find.\n* The angles in any quadrilateral add up to 360 degrees.\n**6.  Finding  \u2220AHB**\n* Using the information above:\n    *  $\\angle AHB = 360^\\circ - 54^\\circ - 52^\\circ - 36^\\circ - 38^\\circ = \\boxed{180^\\circ}$\n**Important Note:**  The fact that $\\angle AHB = 180^\\circ$ tells us that points A, H, and B are collinear.  This is a common property of the orthocenter (the point where the altitudes of a triangle intersect). \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Diagram**\n* Draw a triangle ABC.\n* Draw the altitude AD (perpendicular to BC).\n* Draw the altitude BE (perpendicular to AC).\n* The altitudes intersect at point H.\n**2. Identify Key Angles**\n*  We know that \u2220BAC = 54\u00b0 and \u2220ABC = 52\u00b0.\n* Since AD and BE are altitudes, we know that \u2220ADB = \u2220BEC = 90\u00b0.\n**3. Focus on Quadrilateral ADHE**\n* Notice that quadrilateral ADHE has four right angles (\u2220ADB, \u2220BEC, \u2220DAH, \u2220EBH). This makes ADHE a rectangle.\n**4.  Angles in a Rectangle**\n*  Opposite angles in a rectangle are equal. Therefore, \u2220AHB = \u2220DAE.\n**5. Find \u2220DAE**\n*  \u2220DAE is an interior angle of triangle ABC.\n* The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180\u00b0.\n* \u2220DAE = 180\u00b0 - \u2220BAC - \u2220ABC = 180\u00b0 - 54\u00b0 - 52\u00b0 = 74\u00b0\n**6. Conclusion**\n*  Since \u2220AHB = \u2220DAE, we have  \u2220AHB = **74\u00b0**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step by step:\n**1. Understand Altitudes**\n* Altitudes are lines drawn from a vertex of a triangle perpendicular to the opposite side (or its extension).\n* Since $\\overline{AD}$ is an altitude, we know  $\\angle ADB = 90^\\circ$. \n* Similarly, since $\\overline{BE}$ is an altitude, we know $\\angle BEC = 90^\\circ$.\n**2. Focus on Quadrilateral ADHE**\n* Notice that quadrilateral $ADHE$ has three right angles: $\\angle ADB$, $\\angle AHE$, and $\\angle DHE$. \n* The sum of the interior angles of any quadrilateral is $360^\\circ$.  Therefore, $\\angle DAH = 360^\\circ - 90^\\circ - 90^\\circ - 90^\\circ = 90^\\circ$. \n**3. Use Triangle Properties**\n* We now know that $\\triangle ADH$ is a right triangle with right angle at $D$. \n* Since $\\angle BAC = 54^\\circ$, we can find $\\angle HAD$:  \n   * $\\angle HAD = 90^\\circ - \\angle BAC = 90^\\circ - 54^\\circ = 36^\\circ$\n**4. Find the Missing Angle**\n* In $\\triangle AHB$, we have:\n   * $\\angle HAB = 36^\\circ$ (from step 3)\n   * $\\angle HBA = 90^\\circ - \\angle ABC = 90^\\circ - 52^\\circ = 38^\\circ$ \n*  Finally, we can find $\\angle AHB$:\n   * $\\angle AHB = 180^\\circ - \\angle HAB - \\angle HBA = 180^\\circ - 36^\\circ - 38^\\circ = \\boxed{106^\\circ}$ \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Properties of Altitudes**\n* Altitudes are lines drawn from a vertex of a triangle perpendicular to the opposite side.\n* In any triangle, the three altitudes intersect at a single point called the orthocenter.\n**2. Analyze the Given Information**\n* We know that  $\\angle BAC = 54^\\circ$ and $\\angle ABC = 52^\\circ$. \n* We also know that $\\overline{AD}$ and $\\overline{BE}$ are altitudes, so they are perpendicular to $\\overline{BC}$ and $\\overline{AC}$, respectively.\n**3. Focus on Quadrilateral ABHE**\n* Notice that quadrilateral $ABHE$ has two right angles: $\\angle AEB$ and $\\angle AHD$.\n* The sum of the interior angles of any quadrilateral is $360^\\circ$.\n**4. Calculate the Missing Angles**\n* Since $\\angle BAC = 54^\\circ$ and $\\angle AEB = 90^\\circ$, we can find $\\angle ABE = 180^\\circ - 54^\\circ - 90^\\circ = 36^\\circ$.\n* Similarly, since $\\angle ABC = 52^\\circ$ and $\\angle AHD = 90^\\circ$, we can find $\\angle BAH = 180^\\circ - 52^\\circ - 90^\\circ = 38^\\circ$.\n**5.
