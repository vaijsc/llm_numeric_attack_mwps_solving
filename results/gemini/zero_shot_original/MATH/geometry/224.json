        "### Response:\n1. **Draw a diagram:** Draw a right triangle ABC with right angle at A. Label the sides AB = 6, BC = 10, and AC (the hypotenuse) as unknown for now.\n2. **Use the Pythagorean Theorem:** Since we have a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of AC:  \n   *  $AB^2 + AC^2 = BC^2$\n   *  $6^2 + AC^2 = 10^2$\n   *  $36 + AC^2 = 100$\n   *  $AC^2 = 64$\n   *  $AC = 8$ \n3. **Recall the definition of cosine:**  In a right triangle, the cosine of an angle is equal to the length of the adjacent side divided by the length of the hypotenuse. \n4. **Apply the definition:**  In our triangle,  \n   *  Adjacent side to angle A = AB = 6\n   *  Hypotenuse = AC = 8\n   *  Therefore, $\\cos A = \\frac{AB}{AC} = \\frac{6}{8} = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}}$. \n",
