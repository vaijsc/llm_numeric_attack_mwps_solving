        "Here's how to find the area of quadrilateral ABCD:\n**1. Visualize the Quadrilateral**\nPlot the points A, B, C, and D on a coordinate plane. You'll notice that the quadrilateral is a rectangle.\n**2. Calculate the Length and Width**\n* **Length:**  The distance between points A and B (or C and D) is 7 - 5 = 2 units.\n* **Width:** The distance between points A and D (or B and C) is 3 - (-1) = 4 units.\n**3. Calculate the Area**\nThe area of a rectangle is length times width: 2 units * 4 units = 8 square units.\n**Therefore, the area of quadrilateral ABCD is 8 square units.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Quadrilateral**\nPlot the points on a coordinate plane. You'll notice that quadrilateral ABCD is a rectangle because:\n*  Sides AB and CD are vertical lines (same x-coordinates).\n*  Sides AD and BC are horizontal lines (same y-coordinates).\n**2. Calculate the Lengths of the Sides**\n* **AB and CD:** The length of these sides is the difference in y-coordinates:  7 - 5 = 2 units.\n* **AD and BC:** The length of these sides is the difference in x-coordinates: 3 - (-1) = 4 units.\n**3. Calculate the Area**\nThe area of a rectangle is length times width.  Therefore, the area of ABCD is:\n* Area =  (AB) * (AD) = 2 * 4 = 8 square units.\n**Answer:** The area of quadrilateral ABCD is **8 square units**. \n",
