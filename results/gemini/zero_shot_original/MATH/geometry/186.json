        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Shape**\nImagine the square with the quarter-circles drawn at each corner.  The shaded region is the area of the square *minus* the area of the four quarter-circles.\n**2. Calculate the Area of the Square**\nThe square has sides of length 6 units, so its area is 6 * 6 = 36 square units.\n**3. Calculate the Area of One Quarter-Circle**\nThe radius of each quarter-circle is 3 units.  The area of a full circle with radius 3 is \u03c0 * 3\u00b2 = 9\u03c0 square units.  Therefore, the area of one quarter-circle is (1/4) * 9\u03c0 = (9/4)\u03c0 square units.\n**4. Calculate the Total Area of the Quarter-Circles**\nSince there are four quarter-circles, their total area is 4 * (9/4)\u03c0 = 9\u03c0 square units.\n**5. Calculate the Area of the Shaded Region**\nThe shaded region's area is the area of the square minus the area of the quarter-circles: 36 - 9\u03c0 square units.\n**6. Find the Value of a + b**\nThe shaded region's area is expressed as  *a - b\u03c0*, where *a* = 36 and *b* = 9.  Therefore, *a + b* = 36 + 9 = **45**. \n",

The shaded region is the area of the square *minus* the areas of the four quarter-circles.\n**2. Calculate the Area of the Square**\nThe area of a square is side * side, so the area of this square is 6 * 6 = 36 square units.\n**3. Calculate the Area of a Quarter-Circle**\nThe area of a full circle is \u03c0 * radius\u00b2 = \u03c0 * 3\u00b2 = 9\u03c0 square units.  A quarter-circle has 1/4 of this area, so the area of one quarter-circle is (1/4) * 9\u03c0 = (9/4)\u03c0 square units.\n**4. Calculate the Total Area of the Quarter-Circles**\nSince there are four quarter-circles, their total area is 4 * (9/4)\u03c0 = 9\u03c0 square units.\n**5.

Calculate the Area of the Square:**\n* Area of a square = side * side = 6 * 6 = 36 square units\n**3. Calculate the Area of One Quarter-Circle:**\n* Area of a circle = \u03c0 * radius\u00b2\n* Area of a quarter-circle = (1/4) * \u03c0 * radius\u00b2 = (1/4) * \u03c0 * 3\u00b2 = (9/4)\u03c0 square units\n**4.

        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Visualize the Problem**\nImagine a square with side length 6.  At each corner, a quarter-circle of radius 3 is drawn, creating a shaded region within the square.\n**2. Find the Area of the Square**\nThe area of the square is 6 * 6 = 36 square units.\n**3. Find the Area of a Single Quarter-Circle**\nThe area of a full circle is \u03c0r\u00b2, where r is the radius.

        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1.  Area of the Square**\nThe square has sides of length 6, so its area is 6 * 6 = 36 square units.\n**2.  Area of a Quarter Circle**\nEach quarter-circle has a radius of 3 units. The area of a full circle is \u03c0r\u00b2, so the area of a quarter-circle is (1/4)\u03c0r\u00b2 = (1/4)\u03c0(3\u00b2) = (9/4)\u03c0 square units.\n**3.  Area of Overlap**\nNotice that the quarter-circles overlap in the middle of the square.  The overlapping region is a square with side length equal to the radius of the quarter-circles, which is 3.  The area of this smaller square is 3 * 3 = 9 square units.\n**4.  Calculating the Shaded Area**\n* **Start with the square's area:** 36 square units\n* **Subtract the area of the four quarter-circles:** 36 - 4(9/4)\u03c0 = 36 - 9\u03c0 square units.\n* **Add back the area of the overlapping square (since we subtracted it twice):** 36 - 9\u03c0 + 9 = 45 - 9\u03c0 square units.\n**5.  Finding a + b**\nThe shaded area is expressed as 45 - 9\u03c0.  Therefore, a = 45 and b = 9, and a + b = 45 + 9 = **54**. \n"
