    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Let the height measure $h$ meters.  By the formula for the area of a cylinder, which states that $V=\\pi r^2 h$ where $V, r, h$ denote volume, radius and height respectively, we have \\[2700\\pi = \\pi (30)^2 h.\\]Solving yields $h = \\boxed{3}$ meters.",

Recall the formula for the volume of a cylinder:**\nThe volume of a cylinder is given by:  V = \u03c0r\u00b2h \nwhere:\n* V = volume\n* r = radius of the base\n* h = height\n**2. Plug in the given values:**\nWe know:\n* V = 2700\u03c0 cubic meters\n* r = 30 meters\nLet's substitute these values into the formula: \n2700\u03c0 = \u03c0(30)\u00b2h\n**3. Simplify and solve for h:**\n* 2700\u03c0 = 900\u03c0h\n* h = 2700\u03c0 / 900\u03c0\n* h = 3\n**Therefore, the height of the tank is 3 meters.** \n",
