        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n* **Circumference of the whole circle:** The circumference of a circle is given by $2\\pi r$, where $r$ is the radius.  In this case, the circumference is $2\\pi(4) = 8\\pi$ inches.\n* **Circumference of the three-quarter circle:** Since the three-quarter circle is $\\frac{3}{4}$ of the whole circle, its circumference is $\\frac{3}{4}(8\\pi) = 6\\pi$ inches.\n* **Length of the discarded arc:** The length of the discarded arc is the difference between the circumference of the whole circle and the circumference of the three-quarter circle: $8\\pi - 6\\pi = \\boxed{2\\pi}$ inches. \n",

        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n* **Find the circumference of the full circle:** The circumference of a circle is given by the formula $C = 2\\pi r$, where $r$ is the radius. In this case, the radius is 4 inches, so the circumference is $2\\pi (4) = 8\\pi$ inches.\n* **Find the length of the three-quarter circle:**  Since the cone is made from three-quarters of the circle, the length of the arc used for the cone is  (3/4) * 8\u03c0 = 6\u03c0 inches.\n* **Find the length of the discarded quarter circle:** The discarded portion is one-quarter of the full circle, so its arc length is (1/4) * 8\u03c0 = **2\u03c0** inches. \n",
