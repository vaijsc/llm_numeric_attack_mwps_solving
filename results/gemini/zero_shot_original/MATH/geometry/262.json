        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Situation**\nSketch the square and the line. You'll see that the line cuts through the top and right sides of the square, forming a triangle on the bottom left and a pentagon on the top right.\n**2. Find the Points of Intersection**\nThe line intersects the square at two points.  To find these points, substitute the y-coordinates of the top and right sides of the square into the equation of the line:\n* **Top Side:**  When y = 1,  1 = (x/2) + 1, so x = 0.  The intersection point is (0, 1).\n* **Right Side:** When x = 1, 1 = (1/2) + 1, so y = 1.5. The intersection point is (1, 1.5).\n**3. Calculate the Area of the Triangle**\nThe triangle has a base of length 1 and a height of 1. Therefore, its area is:\n(1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 1 * 1 = 1/2\n**4. Calculate the Area of the Square**\nThe square has side length 2, so its area is:\nside * side = 2 * 2 = 4\n**5. Find the Area of the Pentagon**\nThe area of the pentagon is the difference between the area of the square and the area of the triangle:\nArea of pentagon = Area of square - Area of triangle = 4 - 1/2 = 3.5\n**Answer:** The area of the pentagon is **3.50** square units. \n",
