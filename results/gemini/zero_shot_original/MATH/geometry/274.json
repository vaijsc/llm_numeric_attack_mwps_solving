        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Understand Similar Triangles**\nSince $\\overline{AB} \\parallel \\overline{DE}$, we know that $\\triangle ABC \\sim \\triangle CDE$.  This means their corresponding sides are proportional and their corresponding angles are congruent.\n**2. Use the Side Ratio**\nWe are given that $BD = 4BC$.  Since $BD = BC + CD$, this means $CD = 3BC$. Therefore, the ratio of corresponding sides in the similar triangles is 1:3 (the ratio of $BC$ to $CD$).\n**3. Area Ratio**\nThe ratio of the areas of similar figures is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides.  Since the side ratio is 1:3, the area ratio of $\\triangle ABC$ to $\\triangle CDE$ is $1^2:3^2 = 1:9$.\n**4. Calculate the Area of  $\\triangle CDE$**\nWe know the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is 6 square centimeters.

Since $BD = BC + CD$, we can write  $BC + CD = 4BC$, which simplifies to $CD = 3BC$.  \nThis means the ratio of corresponding sides in the triangles is 1:3 (i.e., the sides of $\\triangle CDE$ are three times longer than the corresponding sides of $\\triangle ABC$).\n**3.

Find the Area of  $\\triangle CDE$**\nSince the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is 6 square centimeters, and the area ratio of $\\triangle ABC$ to $\\triangle CDE$ is 1:9, the area of $\\triangle CDE$ is 9 times larger.\nTherefore, the area of $\\triangle CDE$ is $6 \\times 9 = \\boxed{54}$ square centimeters. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understanding the Diagram and Ratios**\n* We're given that $\\overline{AB} \\parallel \\overline{DE}$. This means that $\\triangle ABC \\sim \\triangle DEC$ (similar triangles).\n* We're also given that $BD = 4BC$, which means $BC = \\frac{1}{5}BD$.\n**2. Using Similarity to Find the Ratio of Areas**\n* The ratio of the areas of similar figures is equal to the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides.  Therefore:\n   \n   [Area of $\\triangle DEC$] / [Area of $\\triangle ABC$] = (DE/AB)\u00b2\n**3.

Therefore, we can say that:\n   \n   DE/AB = CD/BC = (BC + BD)/BC = (BC + 4BC)/BC = 5\n**4. Calculating the Area of $\\triangle CDE$**\n* Now we know that:\n   (Area of $\\triangle DEC$)/(Area of $\\triangle ABC$) = (5)\u00b2 = 25\n* Since the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is 6 square centimeters, the area of $\\triangle CDE$ is:\n   (Area of $\\triangle DEC$) = 25 * (Area of $\\triangle ABC$) = 25 * 6 = **150 square centimeters** \n",
        "Here's a step-by-step solution:\n**1. Understanding the problem:**\n* We have a triangle ABC with an area of 6 square centimeters.\n* Line DE is parallel to line AB, meaning triangle CDE is similar to triangle CAB.\n* BD is 4 times the length of BC, which tells us the ratio of corresponding sides in the two triangles.\n**2. Using the similarity ratio:**\n* Since DE is parallel to AB, triangles CDE and CAB are similar. \n* The ratio of corresponding sides in similar triangles is the same.  Therefore, CD/CB = DE/AB = BD/BC = 4. \n* This means CD is 4 times longer than CB, and DE is 4 times longer than AB.\n**3. Area ratio in similar triangles:**\n* The ratio of the areas of similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides.\n* Therefore, the area of triangle CDE is 4\u00b2 = 16 times the area of triangle CAB.\n**4. Finding the area of triangle CDE:**\n* The area of triangle CAB is 6 square centimeters.\n* The area of triangle CDE is 16 times the area of triangle CAB, so its area is 16 * 6 = **96 square centimeters**. \n",

Understand the Geometry**\n* **Parallel Lines:** Since  $\\overline{AB}\\|\\overline{DE}$, we know that $\\triangle ABC$ and $\\triangle CDE$ are similar triangles.\n* **Similar Triangles:**  Similar triangles have proportional sides and equal corresponding angles. This means the ratio of corresponding sides in $\\triangle ABC$ and $\\triangle CDE$ is the same. \n**2. Use the Given Information**\n* **Area:**  The area of $\\triangle ABC$ is 6 square centimeters.\n* **Side Ratio:**  We're told that $BD = 4BC$.  Since $BD$ is the base of $\\triangle CDE$ and $BC$ is the base of $\\triangle ABC$, the ratio of their bases is 4:1.\n**3. Apply the Ratio of Areas**\n* **Area Ratio:** The ratio of the areas of two similar figures is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Since the ratio of the bases of the triangles is 4:1, the ratio of their areas is $4^2 : 1^2 = 16:1$.\n**4.
