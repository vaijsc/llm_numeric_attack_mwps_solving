        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Formula:**\n* The volume of a right circular cylinder is given by the formula:  *Volume = \u03c0r\u00b2h* \n   *  where 'r' is the radius and 'h' is the height.\n**2. Calculate the Volume of the First Cylinder:**\n* Radius (r\u2081) = 2 inches\n* Height (h\u2081) = 1 inch\n* Volume (V\u2081) = \u03c0(2\u00b2)(1) = 4\u03c0 cubic inches\n**3. Set Up an Equation for the Second Cylinder:**\n* We know the volume of the second cylinder (V\u2082) is equal to the volume of the first cylinder (V\u2081).\n* Radius (r\u2082) = 1 inch\n* Height (h\u2082) = unknown\n* V\u2081 = V\u2082 \n* 4\u03c0 = \u03c0(1\u00b2)(h\u2082) \n**4. Solve for the Height of the Second Cylinder:**\n* 4\u03c0 = \u03c0(h\u2082)\n* h\u2082 = 4 inches\n**Answer:** The height of the second cylinder is **4 inches**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Formulas:**\n* **Volume of a Cylinder:**  V = \u03c0r\u00b2h, where 'r' is the radius and 'h' is the height.\n**2. Calculate the Volume of the First Cylinder:**\n* r = 2 inches\n* h = 1 inch\n* V = \u03c0(2\u00b2)(1) = 4\u03c0 cubic inches\n**3.  Set Up an Equation for the Second Cylinder:**\n* We know the volume of the second cylinder is also 4\u03c0 cubic inches.\n* r = 1 inch\n* Let 'h' represent the height of the second cylinder.\n* 4\u03c0 = \u03c0(1\u00b2)(h) \n**4. Solve for the Height (h):**\n* 4\u03c0 = \u03c0h\n* h = 4 inches\n**Answer:** The height of the second cylinder is **4 inches**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the volume of the first cylinder:**\n* The formula for the volume of a cylinder is V = \u03c0r\u00b2h, where V is the volume, r is the radius, and h is the height.\n* For the first cylinder: r = 2 inches and h = 1 inch\n* V = \u03c0(2\u00b2)(1) = 4\u03c0 cubic inches\n**2. Find the height of the second cylinder:**\n* We know the volume of the second cylinder is also 4\u03c0 cubic inches.\n* We know the radius of the second cylinder is 1 inch.\n* Let the height of the second cylinder be 'h'.\n* Using the volume formula: 4\u03c0 = \u03c0(1\u00b2)(h)\n* Simplifying: 4\u03c0 = \u03c0h\n* Dividing both sides by \u03c0: h = 4 inches\n**Answer:** The height of the second cylinder is **4 inches**. \n",
