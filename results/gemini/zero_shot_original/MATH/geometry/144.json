    "solution": "A ball of yarn 12 inches in diameter has twice the diameter of a ball of yarn 6 inches in diameter.  Let the radius of the small ball be $r$ and the radius of the large ball be $2r$.  Then, the volume of the small ball is $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$ and the volume of the large ball is $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi (2r)^3 = 8\\cdot \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$.  Hence the large ball has 8 times the volume of the small ball, so Mrs. Read can knit $\\boxed{8}$ pairs of identical mittens with the large yarn ball.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Understand the Relationship:**\n* The amount of yarn in a ball is directly proportional to its volume.  This means if the diameter doubles, the volume (and therefore the yarn) also doubles.\n**2. Calculate the Volume Increase:**\n* The larger ball has a diameter twice as big as the smaller ball. \n* Since volume is calculated using a cube of the diameter (think of the formula for the volume of a sphere), a diameter that's twice as big means a volume that's 2 x 2 x 2 = 8 times larger.\n**3. Determine the Number of Mitten Pairs:**\n* The larger ball has 8 times more yarn than the smaller ball.\n* Since the smaller ball makes one pair of mittens, the larger ball can make **8** pairs of mittens. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Relationship:**\n* The amount of yarn in a ball is directly proportional to its volume.  This means if the diameter doubles, the volume (and therefore the yarn amount) increases by a factor of eight. \n**2. Calculate the Volume Ratio:**\n* The larger ball has a diameter twice that of the smaller ball.\n* The volume of a sphere is calculated with the formula (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3, where r is the radius.\n* Since the diameter doubles, the radius also doubles. This means the volume of the larger ball is 2\u00b3 = 8 times greater than the smaller ball.\n**3. Determine the Number of Mittens:**\n* Because the larger ball has eight times the yarn, Mrs. Read can knit eight times the number of mittens.\n* Since she can knit one pair with the smaller ball, she can knit **eight** pairs with the larger ball. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Understand the Relationship:**\n* The amount of yarn in a ball is directly proportional to its volume.  This means if the diameter doubles, the volume (and therefore the amount of yarn) increases by a factor of 2 cubed (2 x 2 x 2 = 8).\n**2. Calculate the Difference:**\n* A ball of yarn with a 12-inch diameter has twice the diameter of a 6-inch ball.\n**3. Apply the Relationship:**\n* Since the diameter doubles, the 12-inch ball has 8 times the yarn as the 6-inch ball.\n**4.  Find the Number of Mittens:**\n* Mrs. Read can knit 8 times as many pairs of mittens with the larger ball of yarn. \n**Answer:** Mrs. Read can knit **8** pairs of identical mittens with the 12-inch diameter ball of yarn. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n* **Volume:** The amount of yarn in a ball is determined by its volume.  Since the balls are spherical, we'll use the formula for the volume of a sphere:  (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3, where 'r' is the radius.\n* **Radius:** The radius is half the diameter. So, the smaller ball has a radius of 3 inches and the larger ball has a radius of 6 inches.\n* **Volume Comparison:**\n    * Smaller ball volume: (4/3)\u03c0(3\u00b3) = 36\u03c0 cubic inches\n    * Larger ball volume: (4/3)\u03c0(6\u00b3) = 288\u03c0 cubic inches\n* **Yarn Ratio:** The larger ball has 288\u03c0 / 36\u03c0 = 8 times the volume of the smaller ball.\n* **Mittens:** Since the larger ball has 8 times the yarn, Mrs. Read can knit 8 times as many pairs of mittens.\n**Answer:** Mrs. Read can knit **8** pairs of identical mittens with the larger ball of yarn. \n",
