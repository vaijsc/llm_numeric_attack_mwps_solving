    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Let the radius and height of the cylinder measure $r$ and $h$ inches respectively.  From the lateral surface area and volume values, we set up the equations \\[2\\pi r h = 24\\pi\\]  and \\[\\pi r^2 h = 24\\pi.\\] These equations simplify to $rh = 12$ and $r^2 h = 24$; it follows that $r = (r^2h)/(rh)=24/12=\\boxed{2}$ inches.",
