    "solution": "We break the belt into six pieces, three where the belt touches no circle and three where it does.\n\nFirst consider the portion of the belt that does not touch a circle.  Each segment is the length of two radii, or $20$ cm.  There are three such segments, or $60$ cm in total.\n\nNow consider the portion of the belt that does touch a circle.  Because there are three circles, the belt will touch each circle for $\\frac{1}{3}$ of its circumference.  Since it does this three times, this is the length of these segments combined, which is the circumference of a full circle, which is $20\\pi$ cm for a circle of radius $10$ cm.\n\nTherefore the length of the belt is $60 + 20\\pi$ cm.  From this we conclude that $a = 60$ and $b = 20,$ and so $a+b = \\boxed{80}.$",

Find the Length of the Straight Segments**\n* Consider triangle $ABC$. It is equilateral, with side length $2r = 2 \\cdot 10 = 20$.\n* Each straight segment has length equal to the side length of this equilateral triangle, so each straight segment has length $20$.\n**3. Find the Length of the Arcs**\n* Each arc is $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the circumference of a circle of radius $10$.\n* The circumference of each circle is $2\\pi r = 20\\pi$.\n*  Each arc has length $\\frac{1}{3}(20\\pi) = \\frac{20}{3}\\pi$.\n**4.

        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Visualize the Belt**\nImagine the belt as a series of straight line segments and arcs of circles.  The belt goes:\n* Along a straight segment from one circle to another.\n* Along a quarter-circle arc of one circle.\n* Along another straight segment.\n* Along another quarter-circle arc.\n* And so on, repeating this pattern three times.\n**2.
