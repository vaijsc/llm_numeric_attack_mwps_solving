        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Angles in Squares and Equilateral Triangles**\n* **Squares:** All angles in a square are right angles (90 degrees).\n* **Equilateral Triangles:** All angles in an equilateral triangle are 60 degrees.\n**2. Finding Angle CBE**\n* Since  $BEFG$ is a square, angle $CBE$ is 90 degrees. \n* Since $BCE$ is an equilateral triangle, angle $CBE$ is 60 degrees.\n**3. Finding Angle GCE**\n*  Angle $GCE$ is the sum of angles $GCB$ and $BCE$.\n* Angle $GCB$ is supplementary to angle $CBE$ (they add up to 180 degrees).  Therefore, angle $GCB = 180^\\circ - 90^\\circ = 90^\\circ$.\n* Angle $BCE$ is 60 degrees (from the equilateral triangle).\n**4.

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Angles in a Square:**\n*  Each angle in a square measures 90 degrees.  Therefore,  \u2220ABE = \u2220FBE = 90\u00b0.\n**2. Angles in an Equilateral Triangle:**\n*  Each angle in an equilateral triangle measures 60 degrees. Therefore, \u2220BCE = 60\u00b0.\n**3. Finding \u2220EBC:**\n* Since \u2220ABE = 90\u00b0 and \u2220BCE = 60\u00b0, we can find \u2220EBC:  \u2220EBC = \u2220ABE - \u2220BCE = 90\u00b0 - 60\u00b0 = 30\u00b0.\n**4.

To find \u2220GCE, we subtract:  \u2220GCE = \u2220GCE - \u2220EBC = 90\u00b0 - 30\u00b0 = **60\u00b0**. \n**Therefore, angle GCE measures 60 degrees.** \n"
