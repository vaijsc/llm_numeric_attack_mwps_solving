        "Here's a step-by-step solution:\n**1. Relate the Area of the Semicircle to its Radius**\n* The area of a circle is given by $\\pi r^2$, where *r* is the radius.\n* The area of a semicircle is half the area of the circle:  $\\frac{1}{2}\\pi r^2$.\n* We are given that the semicircle has an area of $2\\pi$.  Setting this equal to the formula above, we get:  \n   \n   $$\\frac{1}{2}\\pi r^2 = 2\\pi$$\n   \n* Solving for *r*, we find the radius of the semicircle:\n   $$r^2 = 4$$\n   $$r = 2$$\n**2.  Understand the Geometry**\n* Since the semicircle is tangent to the legs of the isosceles right triangle, the radius of the semicircle is also the altitude of the triangle from the right angle. \n* The diameter of the semicircle is the hypotenuse of the isosceles right triangle.\n**3. Calculate the Side Lengths of the Triangle**\n* The hypotenuse of the triangle is twice the radius of the semicircle: 2 * 2 = 4.\n* In an isosceles right triangle, the legs have lengths equal to $\\frac{\\text{hypotenuse}}{\\sqrt{2}}$. \n* Therefore, the legs of triangle ABC have lengths $\\frac{4}{\\sqrt{2}} = 2\\sqrt{2}$.\n**4. Calculate the Area of the Triangle**\n* The area of a triangle is given by $\\frac{1}{2} \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}$.\n* Since the triangle is isosceles right, the base and height are the same length: $2\\sqrt{2}$.\n* The area of triangle ABC is:\n   $$\\frac{1}{2} (2\\sqrt{2})(2\\sqrt{2}) = \\boxed{4}$$ \n",
        "Here's a step-by-step solution:\n**1. Find the radius of the semicircle:**\n* The area of a semicircle is half the area of a full circle:  Area = (1/2)\u03c0r\u00b2\n* We're given the area of the semicircle is 2\u03c0: 2\u03c0 = (1/2)\u03c0r\u00b2\n* Solving for r, we get r\u00b2 = 4, so r = 2.\n**2.  Recognize the key geometric relationships:**\n* Since the semicircle is tangent to the legs of the isosceles right triangle, the radius of the semicircle is the altitude from the right angle to the hypotenuse of the triangle. \n* This also means that the radius divides the hypotenuse into two equal segments, each with length equal to the radius (2).\n**3. Determine the length of the legs:**\n* The isosceles right triangle has a 45-45-90 degree pattern.\n* The hypotenuse is \u221a2 times the length of each leg (using the Pythagorean Theorem or the properties of a 45-45-90 triangle).\n* Since the hypotenuse has length 4, each leg has length 4/\u221a2 = 2\u221a2.\n**4. Calculate the area of the triangle:**\n* Area of a triangle = (1/2) * base * height\n* In this case, the base and height are both equal to the length of the legs: 2\u221a2\n* Area of triangle ABC = (1/2) * (2\u221a2) * (2\u221a2) = **4**\n**Therefore, the area of triangle ABC is 4.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Find the radius of the semicircle:**\n* The area of a semicircle is given by  (1/2)\u03c0r\u00b2, where r is the radius. \n* We are given that the area of the semicircle is 2\u03c0.\n* Therefore, (1/2)\u03c0r\u00b2 = 2\u03c0\n* Solving for r, we get r\u00b2 = 4, so r = 2.\n**2.  Relate the radius to the sides of the triangle:**\n* Since the semicircle is tangent to sides AC and BC, the radius of the semicircle is equal to the altitude of the triangle from C to AB.\n* Let x be the length of each leg of the isosceles right triangle. \n* The hypotenuse AB has length x\u221a2 (using the Pythagorean Theorem).\n* Since the altitude from C bisects AB, the length of AO (and BO) is x\u221a2/2.\n**3.  Use the Pythagorean Theorem on triangle AOC:**\n* Triangle AOC is a right triangle with legs of length 2 (radius) and x\u221a2/2 (half the hypotenuse).\n* Using the Pythagorean Theorem: 2\u00b2 + (x\u221a2/2)\u00b2 = (x\u221a2/2)\u00b2 \n* Simplifying, we get 4 + x\u00b2/2 = x\u00b2/2\n* This equation has no solutions, which means there's an error in our assumptions or calculations. \n**The Error and Correction:**\nThe error lies in assuming that the altitude from C bisects AB.  Since the semicircle is tangent to AC and BC, the center O of the semicircle must lie on the angle bisector of angle C.  This means that the altitude from C to AB does *not* bisect AB.\n**4.  Correct Approach:**\n* Let the point where the altitude from C intersects AB be D.  \n* Since triangle ABC is isosceles, AD = DB.\n* Let CD = 2 (the radius of the semicircle).\n* Let AD = DB = y.\n**5.  Use the Pythagorean Theorem on triangle ACD:**\n*  We have a right triangle with legs of length 2 (CD) and y (AD).\n* Using the Pythagorean Theorem: 2\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = (x\u221a2/2)\u00b2\n* Simplifying: 4 + y\u00b2 = x\u00b2/2\n**6.  Use the Pythagorean Theorem on triangle BCD:**\n* We have a right triangle with legs of length 2 (CD) and y (BD).\n* Using the Pythagorean Theorem: 2\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = (x\u221a2/2)\u00b2\n* Simplifying: 4 + y\u00b2 = x\u00b2/2\n**7.  Solve for x:**\n* Since both equations are the same, we can solve for x in terms of y:\n* x\u00b2 = 8 + 2y\u00b2\n* x = \u221a(8 + 2y\u00b2)\n**8.  Find the area of triangle ABC:**\n* Area of triangle ABC = (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * x\u221a2 * 2 \n* Area of triangle ABC = x\u221a2 = \u221a2 * \u221a(8 + 2y\u00b2)\n**9.  We cannot find a numerical value for the area of triangle ABC:**\nWe have an expression for the area in terms of y, but we don't have enough information to solve for y (or x). Therefore, we cannot determine a numerical value for the area of triangle ABC. \n",

Relate the radius to the sides of the triangle.**\n* Since the semicircle is tangent to the legs of the isosceles right triangle, the radius of the semicircle is equal to the length of the legs of the triangle.  \n* Therefore, AC = BC = 2.\n**3. Find the hypotenuse.**\n* Since triangle ABC is a 45-45-90 triangle, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem or the special ratios:\n    *  Hypotenuse = leg\u221a2 = 2\u221a2\n**4. Calculate the area of the triangle.**\n* Area of a triangle = (1/2) * base * height\n* In triangle ABC, the base and height are both equal to 2.\n* Area of triangle ABC = (1/2) * 2 * 2 = **2** \n**Therefore, the area of triangle ABC is 2.** \n",

Calculate the area of the triangle:**\n*  The area of a triangle is (1/2) * base * height.\n*  In our triangle, the base and height are both equal to 2.\n*  Therefore, the area of triangle *ABC* is (1/2) * 2 * 2 = **2**. \n"
