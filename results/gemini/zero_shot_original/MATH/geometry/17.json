        "**1. Visualize the Triangle**\nImagine a coordinate plane. Plot points P(0,5), Q(6,9), and R(12,0). You'll notice that the triangle looks like a right triangle, with the right angle at point R. \n**2. Find the Lengths of the Legs**\n* **PR:**  This is a vertical line segment. The difference in the y-coordinates gives us the length: 5 - 0 = 5 units.\n* **QR:** This is a horizontal line segment. The difference in the x-coordinates gives us the length: 12 - 6 = 6 units.\n**3. Calculate the Area**\nSince we have a right triangle, the area is simply:\n(1/2) * base * height \n* Base = PR = 5 units\n* Height = QR = 6 units\nArea = (1/2) * 5 * 6 = **15 square units** \n",
        "Here's how to find the area of the triangle, step-by-step:\n**1. Identify the Right Angle**\n*  Notice that the slope of line segment $PQ$ is $\\frac{9-5}{6-0} = \\frac{2}{3}$.\n*  The slope of line segment $QR$ is $\\frac{0-9}{12-6} = -\\frac{3}{2}$. \n*  Since the product of these slopes is -1, the line segments $PQ$ and $QR$ are perpendicular, meaning $\\angle PQR$ is a right angle.\n**2. Find the Lengths of the Legs**\n* **PQ:**  Use the distance formula:  \n   $PQ = \\sqrt{(6-0)^2 + (9-5)^2} = \\sqrt{36 + 16} = \\sqrt{52} = 2\\sqrt{13}$\n* **QR:**  Use the distance formula:\n   $QR = \\sqrt{(12-6)^2 + (0-9)^2} = \\sqrt{36 + 81} = \\sqrt{117} = 3\\sqrt{13}$\n**3.

Find the lengths of the sides of the triangle:**\n* **PQ:**  We can use the distance formula:\n   *  \u221a[(6 - 0)\u00b2 + (9 - 5)\u00b2] = \u221a(6\u00b2 + 4\u00b2) = \u221a52 = 2\u221a13 \n* **QR:**  We can use the distance formula:\n   *  \u221a[(12 - 6)\u00b2 + (0 - 9)\u00b2] = \u221a(6\u00b2 + 9\u00b2) = \u221a117 = 3\u221a13\n* **PR:**  We can use the distance formula:\n   * \u221a[(12 - 0)\u00b2 + (0 - 5)\u00b2] = \u221a(12\u00b2 + 5\u00b2) = \u221a169 = 13\n**2. Identify the right angle:**\nNotice that the lengths of the sides satisfy the Pythagorean theorem: (2\u221a13)\u00b2 + (3\u221a13)\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 \nThis means that triangle PQR is a right triangle, and the right angle is at point Q.\n**3. Calculate the area:**\nThe area of a right triangle is (1/2) * base * height.  We can use PQ as the base and QR as the height:\nArea = (1/2) * 2\u221a13 * 3\u221a13 = **39 square units** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Find the slopes of the lines:**\n* **Slope of PQ:**  The slope of a line passing through points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by  (y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1).  So, the slope of PQ is (9 - 5) / (6 - 0) = 4/6 = 2/3.\n* **Slope of QR:**  The slope of QR is (0 - 9) / (12 - 6) = -9/6 = -3/2.\n* **Slope of PR:** The slope of PR is (0 - 5) / (12 - 0) = -5/12.\n**2.  Identify the right angle:**\nNotice that the slopes of PQ and QR are negative reciprocals of each other (2/3 and -3/2).  This means PQ and QR are perpendicular, and  angle Q is the right angle.\n**3.  Find the lengths of the legs:**\n* **PQ:**  We can use the distance formula:  \u221a((6 - 0)^2 + (9 - 5)^2) = \u221a(36 + 16) = \u221a52 = 2\u221a13.\n* **QR:**  Similarly, \u221a((12 - 6)^2 + (0 - 9)^2) = \u221a(36 + 81) = \u221a117 = 3\u221a13.\n**4.
