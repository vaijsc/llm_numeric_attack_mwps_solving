        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n1. **Visualize:**  Imagine the box. Point P is in the center of the top base, and point Q is a corner of the bottom base.\n2. **Draw a Diagonal:** Draw a line segment from point P to the center of the bottom base. This line segment is perpendicular to both bases and has a length of 4 cm (the thickness of the box).\n3. **Right Triangle:** Now, consider the right triangle formed by:\n   *  The line segment from point P to the center of the bottom base (length 4 cm).\n   *  A line segment from the center of the bottom base to point Q (half the diagonal of the square base).\n   *  The line segment from point P to point Q (the distance we want to find).\n4. **Calculate Diagonal:** The diagonal of the square base has length  \u221a(16\u00b2 + 16\u00b2) = 16\u221a2 cm.  Half of this diagonal is 8\u221a2 cm.\n5. **Pythagorean Theorem:**  Apply the Pythagorean theorem to the right triangle:\n   *  (distance from P to Q)\u00b2 = 4\u00b2 + (8\u221a2)\u00b2 \n   *  (distance from P to Q)\u00b2 = 16 + 128\n   *  (distance from P to Q)\u00b2 = 144\n6. **Solve:** Take the square root of both sides:\n   *  distance from P to Q = \u221a144 = **12 cm** \n**Therefore, the distance from point P to point Q is 12 cm.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n1. **Visualize the box:** Imagine the box with point P at the center of the top base and point Q at a corner of the bottom base.\n2. **Find the distance from the center of a base to a corner:**  The distance from the center of a square to a corner is half the length of a diagonal. Since the base is a square with side length 16 cm, the diagonal has length $16\\sqrt{2}$ cm.  Therefore, the distance from the center of the base to a corner is $8\\sqrt{2}$ cm.\n3. **Use the Pythagorean Theorem:**  Imagine a right triangle where:\n   - The hypotenuse is the line segment PQ.\n   - One leg is the distance from the center of the top base to the corner of the top base (which we found to be $8\\sqrt{2}$ cm).\n   - The other leg is the height of the box (4 cm).\n4. **Calculate the distance PQ:** By the Pythagorean Theorem:\n   - $PQ^2 = (8\\sqrt{2})^2 + 4^2$\n   - $PQ^2 = 128 + 16$\n   - $PQ^2 = 144$\n   - $PQ = \\sqrt{144} = \\boxed{12}$ cm \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Visualize the Situation**\nImagine the box.  Point P is in the center of the bottom square base. Point Q is at a corner of the top square base.\n**2.  Find the Distance from P to the Center of the Top Base**\n* The box is 4 cm thick, so the distance from P to the center of the top base is **4 cm**.\n**3. Find the Distance from the Center of the Top Base to Q**\n* The top base is a square with sides of 16 cm.  The distance from the center of the square to a corner is half the diagonal of the square.\n* The diagonal of a square forms a 45-45-90 right triangle.  The sides of a 45-45-90 triangle are in the ratio 1:1:\u221a2. \n* Since the side of the square is 16 cm, the diagonal is 16\u221a2 cm.\n* The distance from the center of the top base to corner Q is half the diagonal, or 8\u221a2 cm.\n**4. Use the Pythagorean Theorem**\n* The line segment from P to Q is the hypotenuse of a right triangle.\n* The legs of the triangle are the distance from P to the center of the top base (4 cm) and the distance from the center of the top base to Q (8\u221a2 cm).\n**5. Calculate the Distance**\n* Using the Pythagorean Theorem: PQ\u00b2 = 4\u00b2 + (8\u221a2)\u00b2 = 16 + 128 = 144\n* Therefore, PQ = \u221a144 = **12 cm** \n",

Find the Diagonal of the Base**\n* The base is a square with side length 16 cm. \n*  The diagonal of a square is found using the Pythagorean theorem:  diagonal = \u221a(side\u00b2 + side\u00b2) = \u221a(16\u00b2 + 16\u00b2) = \u221a512 = 16\u221a2 cm\n**3.  Find the Distance from the Center to a Corner of the Base**\n* The diagonal of the base bisects the square into two right triangles.\n* The distance from the center (P) to a corner of the base is half the length of the diagonal:  (16\u221a2)/2 = 8\u221a2 cm.\n**4. Use the Pythagorean Theorem Again**\n*  We now have a right triangle where:\n    *  The base is 8\u221a2 cm (from the center of the base to a corner)\n    *  The height is 4 cm (the thickness of the box).\n* We want to find the hypotenuse, which is the distance from P to Q.\n**5.
