        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**Step 1: Reflection over the line x = 1**\n* The point (0, 0) is 1 unit to the left of the line x = 1.\n* Reflecting it over the line x = 1 moves it 1 unit to the right.\n* The new point is (2, 0).\n**Step 2: Reflection over the line y = 2**\n* The point (2, 0) is 2 units below the line y = 2.\n* Reflecting it over the line y = 2 moves it 2 units above the line.\n* The final point is (2, 4).\n**Answer:** (2, 4) \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**Step 1: Reflecting over the vertical line x = 1**\n* **Understanding Reflections:** When a point is reflected over a vertical line, the x-coordinate changes, while the y-coordinate stays the same.  The distance between the original point and the line of reflection is the same as the distance between the reflected point and the line.\n* **Applying it:**  The point (0,0) is 1 unit to the left of the line x = 1.  To reflect it, we move it 1 unit to the right of the line, giving us the point **(2, 0)**.\n**Step 2: Reflecting over the horizontal line y = 2**\n* **Understanding Reflections:** When a point is reflected over a horizontal line, the y-coordinate changes, while the x-coordinate stays the same.  The distance between the original point and the line of reflection is the same as the distance between the reflected point and the line.\n* **Applying it:** The point (2, 0) is 2 units below the line y = 2. To reflect it, we move it 2 units above the line, giving us the point **(2, 4)**.\n**Therefore, the resulting point is (2, 4).** \n",
