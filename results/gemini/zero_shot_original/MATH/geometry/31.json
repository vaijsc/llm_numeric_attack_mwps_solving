    "solution": "Since each non-hexagonal face is a rectangle with base 6 inches and height 3 feet, each face has an area of $6$ inches $\\times 3$ feet $= .5$ feet $\\times 3$ feet $= 1.5$ square feet per face.  Since there are 6 faces (6 edges to a hexagon), that makes for a total area of $\\boxed{9}$ square feet.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Visualize the Prism**\nImagine a hexagonal prism. It has two hexagonal bases and six rectangular faces connecting them.  We want to find the total area of these six rectangular faces.\n**2.  Dimensions**\n* **Height:** The height of the prism is 3 feet.\n* **Base Edge:** Each edge of the hexagonal bases is 6 inches, which is equal to 0.5 feet (since 1 foot = 12 inches).\n**3.  Area of One Rectangular Face**\n* Each rectangular face has a length equal to the edge of the hexagon (0.5 feet) and a width equal to the height of the prism (3 feet).\n* Area of one rectangle: (0.5 feet) * (3 feet) = 1.5 square feet\n**4.  Total Area of Non-Hexagonal Faces**\n* Since there are six rectangular faces, the total area is:  6 * (1.5 square feet) = 9 square feet\n**Answer:** The sum of the areas of the non-hexagonal faces of the prism is **9 square feet**. \n",
