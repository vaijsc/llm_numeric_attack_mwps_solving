        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Find the length of the legs of the isosceles right triangles:**\n* Since BC has length 2, and triangle ABC is an isosceles right triangle, AB and AC each have length  2\u221a2 (using the Pythagorean Theorem or the fact that the hypotenuse is \u221a2 times the length of a leg).\n**2.  Find the length of AD:**\n* Triangle ADC is also an isosceles right triangle, with AC as the hypotenuse.  Therefore, AD has length 2\u221a2/\u221a2 = 2.\n**3.  Calculate the perimeter:**\n* The perimeter of ABCD is AB + BC + CD + DA = 2\u221a2 + 2 + 2\u221a2 + 2 = **4\u221a2 + 4** units. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Find the side lengths of the triangles:**\n* Since triangle ABC is an isosceles right triangle with BC = 2, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find AB and AC:  \n   * AB\u00b2 + BC\u00b2 = AC\u00b2\n   * AB\u00b2 + 2\u00b2 = AC\u00b2\n   * Since AB = AC, we can substitute: 2AB\u00b2 = 4\n   * AB\u00b2 = 2 \n   * AB = AC = \u221a2\n**2. Find the length of AD:**\n* Triangle ACD is also an isosceles right triangle.  Since AC = \u221a2, AD = CD = \u221a2.\n**3.
