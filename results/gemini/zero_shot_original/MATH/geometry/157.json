The apex (top point) of the pyramid is located at the center of the cube.\n**2. Find the Height of the Pyramid**\nThe height of the pyramid is the distance from the apex (center of the cube) to the base. Since the cube has side length 2, the distance from the center of a face to the center of the cube is half the side length, or 1.\n**3. Find the Area of the Base**\nThe base of the pyramid is a square with side length 2.  The area of a square is side length squared, so the base area is 2 * 2 = 4.\n**4. Apply the Volume Formula**\nThe volume of a pyramid is given by:\nVolume = (1/3) * Base Area * Height\nSubstituting our values:\nVolume = (1/3) * 4 * 1 = **4/3**\n**Therefore, the volume of the pyramid is 4/3 cubic units.** \n",

        "### Response:\n1. **Find the area of the base:** The base of the pyramid is one face of the cube, which is a square. The side length of the square is 2, so the area of the base is $2^2 = 4$.\n2. **Find the height of the pyramid:** The height of the pyramid is the distance from the center of the cube to one of its faces.  Since the side length of the cube is 2, the distance from the center to a face is half the side length, or 1.\n3. **Use the formula for the volume of a pyramid:** The volume of a pyramid is given by  $\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\text{base area} \\cdot \\text{height}$.

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Pyramid**\nImagine the cube with the pyramid inside.  The base of the pyramid is a square face of the cube, and the apex (top point) of the pyramid is directly above the center of this square.\n**2. Find the Height of the Pyramid**\n* The cube's side length is 2.\n* The center of the square base is 1 unit away from each side of the square.\n* Draw a line segment from the center of the square base to the apex of the pyramid. This line segment is the height of the pyramid. \n* This height is also half the diagonal of the cube. \n* The diagonal of a square with side length 2 is $2\\sqrt{2}$, so the height of the pyramid is $\\sqrt{2}$.\n**3. Calculate the Volume**\nThe volume of a pyramid is given by:\n*  Volume = (1/3) * (Area of the base) * (Height)\n* The base of the pyramid is a square with side length 2, so its area is $2^2 = 4$.\n* We found the height of the pyramid to be $\\sqrt{2}$.\nTherefore, the volume of the pyramid is: \n(1/3) * 4 * $\\sqrt{2}$ = **(4/3)\u221a2** \n"
