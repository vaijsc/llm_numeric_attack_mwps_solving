The area of triangle $ADF$ is $y(u + v)/2 = 5$, so $y(u + v) = 10$.  The area of triangle $CEF$ is $xv/2 = 9$, so $xv = 18$.  Thus, we have the system of equations \\begin{align*}\nux + uy &= 16, \\\\\nuy + vy &= 10, \\\\\nvx &= 18.\n\\end{align*} Solving for $x$ in equation (1), we find \\[x = \\frac{16 - uy}{u}.\\] Solving for $v$ in equation (2), we find \\[v = \\frac{10 - uy}{y}.\\] Substituting into equation (3), we get \\[\\frac{10 - uy}{y} \\cdot \\frac{16 - uy}{u} = 18.\\] This equation simplifies to \\[u^2 y^2 - 44uy + 160 = 0.\\] We recognize this equation as a quadratic in $uy$, which factors as $(uy - 4)(uy - 40) = 0$.  From equation (1), $uy$ must be less than 16, so $uy = 4$.\n\nThen from equation (1), $ux = 16 - uy = 16 - 4 = 12$, and from equation (2), $vy = 10 - uy = 10 - 4 = 6$.  Therefore, the area of rectangle $ABCD$ is $(u + v)(x + y) = ux + uy + vx + vy = 12 + 4 + 18 + 6 = \\boxed{40}$.",

        "Let's break down the problem and solve it step by step:\n**1. Understanding the Areas**\n* **Triangle ABE:**  The area of triangle ABE is 8. This means  (1/2) * AB * BE = 8. \n* **Triangle ADF:**  The area of triangle ADF is 5. This means (1/2) * AD * DF = 5.\n* **Triangle CEF:**  The area of triangle CEF is 9. This means (1/2) * CE * CF = 9.\n**2. Relating the Areas to Rectangle ABCD**\n* Notice that the area of rectangle ABCD is the sum of the areas of the three triangles and the area of quadrilateral ABFD. \n* We can find the area of quadrilateral ABFD by subtracting the areas of the three triangles from the area of rectangle ABCD.\n**3. Finding the Area of ABFD**\n* Let's express the area of ABFD in terms of the areas of the triangles and the area of the rectangle:\n   Area of ABFD = Area of ABCD - Area of ABE - Area of ADF - Area of CEF\n* Let 'x' be the area of rectangle ABCD. Then, we have: \n   Area of ABFD = x - 8 - 5 - 9 = x - 22\n**4. Using Similar Triangles**\n* Now, let's use the fact that triangles ABE and CEF are similar.  This means their corresponding sides are proportional.\n*  The ratio of their bases is BE/CE = AB/CF.\n*  We can write this in terms of the areas:\n    * Area of ABE / Area of CEF = (1/2) * AB * BE / (1/2) * CE * CF = (AB/CF) * (BE/CE) = (AB/CF)^2.\n*  This gives us: 8/9 = (AB/CF)^2.\n**5. Solving for the Area of Rectangle ABCD**\n* Let's use the equation from step 4 and the fact that the area of ABFD is x - 22.\n* We know:\n    * Area of ABE = (1/2) * AB * BE = 8.\n    * Area of CEF = (1/2) * CE * CF = 9.\n    * Area of ABFD = x - 22 = (1/2) * AB * AD + (1/2) * AD * DF - (1/2) * BE * DF\n* Now, let's substitute the areas of the triangles:\n    * 8 / 9 = (AB/CF)^2\n    * x - 22 = (1/2) * AB * AD + (1/2) * AD * DF - (1/2) * BE * DF\n*  Since AB/CF = (8/9)^1/2, we can rewrite the equation for the area of ABFD as:\n    * x - 22 = (1/2) * AB * AD + (1/2) * AD * DF - (1/2) * BE * DF = (1/2) * AB * AD + (1/2) * AD * DF - (1/2) * BE * DF = (1/2) * AB * AD + (1/2) * AD * DF - (1/2) * BE * DF = (1/2) * AB * AD + (1/2) * AD * DF -
