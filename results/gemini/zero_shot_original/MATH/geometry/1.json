        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n1. **Recognize the Relationship:** Since we're dealing with a right triangle, we can use the cosine function in terms of the sides:\n   *  cos(B) = (adjacent side to B) / (hypotenuse) \n   *  cos(C) = (adjacent side to C) / (hypotenuse)\n2. **Identify Sides:** \n   * The hypotenuse is the side opposite the right angle (AC) and has length 9.\n   * The adjacent side to angle B is BC, and the adjacent side to angle C is AB.\n3. **Find Missing Side:** We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the missing side AB:\n   * AB\u00b2 + BC\u00b2 = AC\u00b2\n   * AB\u00b2 + 3\u00b2 = 9\u00b2\n   * AB\u00b2 = 81 - 9 \n   * AB\u00b2 = 72\n   * AB = \u221a72 = 6\u221a2\n4. **Calculate Cosine of C:** Now we can find cos(C):\n   * cos(C) = (AB) / (AC) = (6\u221a2) / 9 = (2\u221a2) / 3\n**Therefore, cos(C) = (2\u221a2) / 3** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Use the Law of Cosines**\nThe Law of Cosines states that in any triangle, the square of one side is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides minus twice the product of those sides and the cosine of the included angle.  We can use this to find the length of side $AC$.\nLet $AC = b$.  Applying the Law of Cosines to triangle $ABC$:\n*  $b^2 = 9^2 + 4^2 - 2(9)(4)\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)$\n*  $b^2 = 81 + 16 - \\frac{216}{5} = \\frac{329}{5}$\n*  $b = \\sqrt{\\frac{329}{5}}$\n**2. Use the Law of Cosines again**\nNow we can use the Law of Cosines to find $\\cos{C}$:\n* $9^2 = b^2 + 4^2 - 2(b)(4)\\cos{C}$\n* $81 = \\frac{329}{5} + 16 - 8\\sqrt{\\frac{329}{5}}\\cos{C}$\n* $8\\sqrt{\\frac{329}{5}}\\cos{C} = \\frac{329}{5} + 16 - 81 = \\frac{144}{5}$\n* $\\cos{C} = \\frac{144}{5} \\cdot \\frac{1}{8\\sqrt{\\frac{329}{5}}} = \\frac{18}{\\sqrt{329}} = \\boxed{\\frac{18\\sqrt{329}}{329}}$ \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Understand the Relationship**\n* **Cosine in a Right Triangle:** In a right triangle, the cosine of an angle is the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse. \n* **Pythagorean Theorem:** We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the missing side of the triangle.\n**2. Find the Hypotenuse**\n* Since $\\cos B = \\frac{3}{5}$, we know that the adjacent side to angle B (which is AC) has length 3, and the hypotenuse (which is BC) has length 5.\n* Using the Pythagorean Theorem:  $AB^2 + AC^2 = BC^2$.

Find cos(C)**\n*  The adjacent side to angle C is AB, and the hypotenuse is BC. \n* Therefore, $\\cos C = \\frac{AB}{BC} = \\frac{4}{5}$.\n**Answer:** $\\cos C = \\boxed{\\frac{4}{5}}$ \n",

Use the Given Information**\n* We are given that  cos(B) = 3/5. This means that the side adjacent to angle B (which is AC) is 3, and the hypotenuse (which is AB) is 5.\n**3. Find the Missing Side**\n*  We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of BC (the side opposite angle B):\n   *  BC\u00b2 = AB\u00b2 - AC\u00b2 = 5\u00b2 - 3\u00b2 = 16\n   *  BC = \u221a16 = 4\n**4. Calculate cos(C)**\n*  Now, we can find cos(C) since we know the adjacent side (BC) and the hypotenuse (AB):\n   * cos(C) = BC / AB = 4 / 5\n**Therefore, cos(C) = 4/5** \n",
