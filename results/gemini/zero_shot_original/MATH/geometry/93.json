Utilizing Midpoints**\nSince E and F are midpoints, we know:\n* EF = (1/2)(AB + DC)  (The midline of a trapezoid is the average of the bases)\n**5. Substituting and Simplifying**\nSubstitute the area expressions and the EF relationship into the given equation [ABEF] = 2[FECD]:\n(1/2) * (AB + EF) * h = 2 * (1/2) * (DC + EF) * h\nSimplify:\nAB + EF = 2(DC + EF)\nAB + (1/2)(AB + DC) = 2DC + 2(1/2)(AB + DC)\n(3/2)AB = (3/2)DC\n**6.

Mark the midpoints $E$ and $F$ as described in the problem.\n**2. Draw a Diagonal**\nDraw diagonal $\\overline{AC}$. This will divide the trapezoid into two triangles: $\\triangle ABC$ and $\\triangle ADC$.\n**3.  Areas and Midpoints**\n* **Area of triangles:** Since $E$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{BC}$, we know that the median $\\overline{AE}$ divides $\\triangle ABC$ into two triangles with equal areas.  Similarly,  $\\overline{CF}$ divides $\\triangle ADC$ into two triangles with equal areas.\n* **Areas of quadrilaterals:** Let's use the following notation for the areas:\n    * $[ABEF] =$ area of quadrilateral $ABEF$\n    * $[FECD] =$ area of quadrilateral $FECD$\n    * $[\\triangle ABC] =$ area of triangle $ABC$\n    * $[\\triangle ADC] =$ area of triangle $ADC$\nWe're given that $[ABEF] = 2[FECD]$.\n**4.

Ratios of Bases**\nTriangles $\\triangle ABC$ and $\\triangle ADC$ share the same height (the distance between the parallel sides of the trapezoid).  Since the ratio of their areas is 2:1, the ratio of their bases must also be 2:1. This means:\n$AB = 2DC$\n**7. The Answer**\nTherefore,  $AB/DC = \\boxed{2}$. \n",

Since triangles ABE and CDE are similar:\n[Area of ABE] / [Area of CDE] = (AB/DC)^2\n**5.  Finding the Areas of ABE and CDE**\n*  Area of ABEF = Area of ABE + Area of AFE = 2x\n*  Area of FECD = Area of CDE + Area of FCE = x\nSince AFE and FCE share the same base (EF) and have the same height (distance between parallel lines AB and DC), their areas are equal.  Therefore:\n*  Area of ABE = x\n*  Area of CDE = x\n**6.
