    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Points with integer coordinates are called lattice points. The length of the rectangle is $5 - (-5) = 10$ units. There will be 9 lattice positions between the two vertical sides of the rectangle. The height of the rectangle is $4 - (-4) = 8$ units. There will be 7 lattice positions between the top and bottom of the rectangle. That's a total of $9 \\times 7 = \\boxed{63}$ lattice points.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Visualize the Rectangle**\nImagine a rectangle with the given vertices. It's centered at the origin (0,0) and has a width of 10 units and a height of 8 units.\n**2. Consider the Boundaries**\nThe rectangle's sides lie on the lines x = -5, x = 5, y = -4, and y = 4.  Notice that the integer coordinates on these lines are *not* strictly inside the rectangle.\n**3. Count the Integer Points**\n* **Horizontal:** There are 9 integer values of x strictly between -5 and 5: -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.\n* **Vertical:** There are 7 integer values of y strictly between -4 and 4: -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3.\n**4. Multiply to Find the Total**\nSince each x-coordinate can be paired with any of the y-coordinates, we multiply to find the total number of points: 9 * 7 = **63**\n**Therefore, there are 63 integer coordinates strictly inside the rectangular region.** \n",

Count the Integer Points**\n* **Horizontal:**  Since the width is 10, there are 9 integer values for the x-coordinate strictly inside the rectangle (-4, -3, -2, ..., 3, 4). \n* **Vertical:** Since the height is 8, there are 7 integer values for the y-coordinate strictly inside the rectangle (-3, -2, -1, ..., 2, 3).\n**3.  Total Integer Points**\nTo get the total number of integer points, multiply the number of horizontal and vertical possibilities:\n9 (horizontal) * 7 (vertical) = **63**\n**Therefore, there are 63 integer coordinates strictly inside the rectangular region.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Rectangle**\nImagine a rectangle centered at the origin (0,0) with sides parallel to the axes. The width is 10 units (from -5 to 5) and the height is 8 units (from -4 to 4).\n**2.  Consider the Boundaries**\nNotice that the rectangle's sides lie on the lines x = -5, x = 5, y = -4, and y = 4. These lines themselves don't contain any points *strictly* inside the rectangle.\n**3.  Count Integer Points in Each Quadrant**\nSince the rectangle is symmetrical, we can count the integer points in one quadrant and multiply by 4. Let's focus on the first quadrant (where both x and y are positive).\n* **x-values:** The possible x-values are 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n* **y-values:** The possible y-values are 1, 2, and 3.\nTherefore, there are 4 * 3 = 12 integer points in the first quadrant.\n**4. Total Integer Points**\nSince there are 4 quadrants, the total number of integer points strictly inside the rectangle is 12 * 4 = **48**. \n",

It's centered at the origin (0,0) and has a width of 10 units and a height of 8 units.\n**2.  Count Integer Points on Each Side**\n* **Horizontal Sides:** Each horizontal side has 10 integer points (from -4 to 4, excluding the endpoints since we want points *strictly* inside).\n* **Vertical Sides:** Each vertical side has 8 integer points (from -3 to 3, excluding the endpoints).\n**3.  Total Integer Points Inside**\nSince we have two horizontal and two vertical sides, we might think to add the number of points on each side: 10 + 10 + 8 + 8 = 36. However, this counts the corner points twice.\n**4. Correct for the Corners**\nThere are 4 corner points, so we need to subtract 4 from our previous count: 36 - 4 = 32\n**Answer:** There are **32** integer coordinates strictly inside the rectangular region. \n",

Consider the Range of x and y Values**\n* **x-values:** The x-coordinates range from -5 (exclusive) to 5 (exclusive). This means we have the following possible integer values for x: -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. There are **9** possible x-values.\n* **y-values:** The y-coordinates range from -4 (exclusive) to 4 (exclusive).  This gives us the following possible integer values for y: -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3. There are **7** possible y-values.\n**3. Find the Total Number of Combinations**\nSince each x-value can be paired with any of the y-values, we multiply the number of possibilities for each: 9 x 7 = **63**\n**Therefore, there are 63 integer coordinates strictly inside the rectangular region.** \n"
