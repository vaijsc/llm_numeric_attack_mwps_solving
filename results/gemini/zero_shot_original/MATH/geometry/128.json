        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the radius:**\n* The diameter is 30 decimeters, so the radius is half of that: 30 dm / 2 = 15 dm\n**2. Find the height:**\n* The height is two times the radius: 15 dm * 2 = 30 dm\n**3. Calculate the volume:**\n* The formula for the volume of a cone is (1/3) * \u03c0 * r\u00b2 * h\n* Plug in the values: (1/3) * \u03c0 * (15 dm)\u00b2 * 30 dm \n* Simplify: (1/3) * \u03c0 * 225 dm\u00b2 * 30 dm \n* Calculate: 75\u03c0 dm\u00b3 \n**Therefore, the volume of the cone is 75\u03c0 cubic decimeters.** \n",
