        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the hypotenuse:**\n* Use the Pythagorean theorem: a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n* Substitute the leg lengths: 8\u00b2 + 15\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n* Simplify: 64 + 225 = c\u00b2\n* Solve for c: c\u00b2 = 289, so c = 17\n**2. Understand the median to the hypotenuse:**\n* The median to the hypotenuse of a right triangle is a line segment drawn from the midpoint of the hypotenuse to the opposite vertex (the right angle).\n* A key property of this median is that it is **half the length of the hypotenuse**.\n**3. Calculate the median length:**\n* The hypotenuse is 17 units long.\n* The median is half of that: 17 / 2 = **8.5 units**\n**Therefore, the length of the median to the hypotenuse is 8.5 units.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the Hypotenuse**\n*  Since we have a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem:  a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n*  Substitute the leg lengths: 8\u00b2 + 15\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n*  Simplify: 64 + 225 = c\u00b2\n*  Solve for c: c\u00b2 = 289, so c = 17\n**2. Understand the Median to the Hypotenuse**\n* The median to the hypotenuse of a right triangle is a segment drawn from the midpoint of the hypotenuse to the right angle.\n* This median is also the circumradius of the triangle, meaning it's the radius of the circle that passes through all three vertices of the triangle.\n**3. Key Property**\n*  The median to the hypotenuse of a right triangle is half the length of the hypotenuse.\n**4. Calculate the Length**\n*  The length of the median is (1/2) * 17 = **17/2 units**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the Hypotenuse:**\n* Use the Pythagorean theorem: a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n* Where 'a' and 'b' are the legs, and 'c' is the hypotenuse.\n* Substitute: 8\u00b2 + 15\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n* Simplify: 64 + 225 = c\u00b2\n* Solve: c\u00b2 = 289, so c = 17 \n**2. Understand Medians in Right Triangles:**\n* The median to the hypotenuse of a right triangle is also the *altitude* (perpendicular height) from the right angle to the hypotenuse.\n* This median divides the hypotenuse into two equal segments.\n**3. Calculate the Length of the Median:**\n* Since the median divides the hypotenuse in half, each segment has a length of 17/2 units.\n* Now, we have a smaller right triangle where:\n    * One leg is 8 units (one of the original legs).\n    * The other leg is 17/2 units (half the hypotenuse).\n    * The median (altitude) is the hypotenuse of this smaller triangle.\n**4. Use the Pythagorean Theorem Again:**\n* a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n* Substitute: 8\u00b2 + (17/2)\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n* Simplify: 64 + 289/4 = c\u00b2\n* Combine terms: 465/4 = c\u00b2\n* Solve: c = \u221a(465/4) = \u221a465 / 2\n**Answer:** The length of the median to the hypotenuse is **\u221a465 / 2 units**. \n",
