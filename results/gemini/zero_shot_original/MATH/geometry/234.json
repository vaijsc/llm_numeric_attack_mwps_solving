        "Here's how to find the area of the isosceles trapezoid step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Trapezoid**\nImagine an isosceles trapezoid. The two parallel sides are the bases, and the two equal sides are the legs.\n* **Base 1 (b1):** 16 cm (the longer base)\n* **Base 2 (b2):** 4 cm (the shorter base)\n* **Leg (l):** 10 cm \n**2. Find the Height**\n* **Draw an altitude:**  Drop a perpendicular line from one of the top vertices to the longer base. This creates a right triangle.\n* **Hypotenuse:** The leg of the trapezoid (10 cm).\n* **One leg:**  Half the difference of the bases: (16 cm - 4 cm) / 2 = 6 cm\n* **The other leg is the height (h):**  Use the Pythagorean theorem: \n   * h\u00b2 = 10\u00b2 - 6\u00b2 = 64\n   * h = \u221a64 = 8 cm\n**3. Calculate the Area**\n* **Area of a trapezoid:** (1/2) * height * (base 1 + base 2)\n* **Substitute the values:** (1/2) * 8 cm * (16 cm + 4 cm) = 80 square centimeters\n**Therefore, the area of the isosceles trapezoid is 80 square centimeters.** \n",
        "Here's how to find the area of the isosceles trapezoid:\n**1. Visualize the Trapezoid**\nDraw a trapezoid with the following side lengths:\n* Top base: 4 cm\n* Bottom base: 16 cm\n* Legs (the equal sides): 10 cm\n**2.  Find the Height**\n* **Draw an altitude:** Drop a perpendicular line from one of the top vertices to the bottom base. This line will be the height of the trapezoid. \n* **Recognize a Right Triangle:** The altitude, half of the difference between the bases, and one of the legs form a right triangle. \n* **Calculate the missing side of the triangle:** The difference between the bases is 16 cm - 4 cm = 12 cm.  Half of that difference is 6 cm.\n* **Use the Pythagorean Theorem:**  Let 'h' be the height. We have:  6\u00b2 + h\u00b2 = 10\u00b2\n* **Solve for 'h':** 36 + h\u00b2 = 100  => h\u00b2 = 64 => h = 8 cm\n**3. Calculate the Area**\n* **Area Formula:**  Area of a trapezoid = (1/2) * height * (sum of bases)\n* **Substitute:** Area = (1/2) * 8 cm * (4 cm + 16 cm)\n* **Simplify:** Area = 4 cm * 20 cm = 80 cm\u00b2\n**Therefore, the area of the isosceles trapezoid is 80 square centimeters.** \n",
