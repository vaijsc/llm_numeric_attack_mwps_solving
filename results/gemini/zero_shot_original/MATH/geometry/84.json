The vertices of the triangle will lie on the circle's circumference.\n[asy]\nunitsize(1 cm);\npair A, B, C, O;\nO = (0,0);\nA = dir(60);\nB = dir(180);\nC = dir(300);\ndraw(Circle(O,1));\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, N);\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, W);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, E);\nlabel(\"$O$\", O, S);\n[/asy]\n**2. Find the Radius**\n* **Equilateral Triangle Properties:**  The centroid (center of gravity) of an equilateral triangle is also its circumcenter (center of the circle that circumscribes it).  The centroid divides each median into a 2:1 ratio.\n* **Median and Radius:** The median of an equilateral triangle is also an altitude. The radius of the circumcircle is the length of the segment from the centroid to a vertex of the triangle.\n* **Finding the Median:**  Consider triangle ABO, where O is the center of the circle and AB is a side of the triangle. Since triangle ABC is equilateral, angle ABO is 60 degrees.  Triangle ABO is a 30-60-90 triangle.  The hypotenuse AB has length 6, so the shorter leg BO (the radius) has length 6/2 = 3.\n**3. Calculate the Area**\nThe area of a circle is given by  \u03c0r\u00b2, where r is the radius.  Since the radius is 3, the area of the circle is \u03c0(3)\u00b2 = **9\u03c0 square units**. \n",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Situation**\nImagine an equilateral triangle with sides of length 6. Now, imagine a circle drawn around the triangle so that all three vertices of the triangle touch the circle. This circle is called the *circumcircle* of the triangle.\n**2. Find the Circumradius**\nThe *circumradius* is the radius of the circle. To find it, we can use the fact that the circumcenter (the center of the circle) is also the centroid of the equilateral triangle. \n* The centroid divides each median of the triangle in a 2:1 ratio.\n* The median of an equilateral triangle is also an altitude.\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.8inch);\npair A,B,C,O;\nA=(0,0);\nB=(1,0);\nC=IP(CR(A,sqrt(3)),CR(B,sqrt(3)));\nO=(A+B+C)/3;\ndraw(Circle(O,sqrt(3)));\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(A--O);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,SW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,SE);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,N);\nlabel(\"$O$\",O,S);\n[/asy]\nLet's focus on one median/altitude.  Call the midpoint of side $AB$ point $M$.  Since $AB=6$, then $AM=BM=3$.  Since the centroid divides the median in a 2:1 ratio, then $AO=\\frac{2}{3}AM=\\frac{2}{3}(3)=2$. This is the circumradius.\n**3. Calculate the Area**\nThe area of a circle is given by the formula:\nArea =  \u03c0 * (radius)^2\nSince the radius is 2, the area of the circle is:\nArea = \u03c0 * (2)^2 = **4\u03c0 square units** \n",
        "### Response:\n1. **Draw a diagram:** Draw an equilateral triangle inscribed in a circle. Draw a line segment from the center of the circle to one of the vertices of the triangle. This line segment is a radius of the circle and also an altitude of the triangle.\n2. **Use geometry:**  The altitude of an equilateral triangle divides the triangle into two 30-60-90 right triangles.  The hypotenuse of each of these triangles is a side of the equilateral triangle, which has length 6.  The shorter leg of each 30-60-90 triangle is half the length of the hypotenuse, so it has length 3.  The longer leg (the altitude) is $\\sqrt{3}$ times the length of the shorter leg, so it has length $3\\sqrt{3}$.\n3. **Find the radius:** The radius of the circle is equal to the altitude of the equilateral triangle, which is $3\\sqrt{3}$.\n4. **Calculate the area:** The area of a circle is $\\pi r^2$, where $r$ is the radius.  Therefore, the area of the circle is $\\pi (3\\sqrt{3})^2 = \\boxed{27\\pi}$ square units. \n",
