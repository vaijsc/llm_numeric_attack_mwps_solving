    "problem": "A rectangular pool is $6\\text{ m}$ wide, $12\\text{ m}$ long and $4\\text{ m}$ deep. If the pool is half full of water, what is the volume of water in the pool?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Since the pool has dimensions $6\\text{ m}$ by $12\\text{ m}$ by $4\\text{ m},$ then its total volume is $6 \\times 12 \\times 4 = 288 \\mbox{ m}^3.$\n\nSince the pool is only half full of water, then the volume of water in the pool is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 288 \\mbox{ m}^3$ or $\\boxed{144 \\mbox{ m}^3}.$",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Calculate the total volume of the pool:**\n* Volume = length \u00d7 width \u00d7 depth\n* Volume = 12 m \u00d7 6 m \u00d7 4 m \n* Volume = 288 cubic meters\n**2. Calculate the volume of water when the pool is half full:**\n* Half the volume = 288 cubic meters / 2 \n* Half the volume = 144 cubic meters\n**Answer:** The volume of water in the pool when it is half full is **144 cubic meters**. \n",
