    "solution": "By the Pythagorean theorem, $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$. Since $a$, $b$, and $c$ are consecutive integers, we can write $a = b-1$ and $c = b + 1$. Substituting this into the Pythagorean theorem, we get $(b-1)^2 + b^2 = (b+1)^2$. This becomes $b^2 - 2b + 1 + b^2 = b^2 + 2b + 1$, or $b^2 - 4b = 0$. Factoring, we have $b(b-4) = 0$, so $b=0$ or $b=4$. If $b=0$, then $a = b-1 = -1$, which can't happen since $a$ is a length. So $b=4$, and $a=3$, $c=5$.\n\nWe'll now find the area of one shaded right triangle. It is one half times the base times the height. If we use $b$ as the height, then $a$ is the base (since it's a right triangle), so the area is $\\frac{1}{2}ab = \\frac{1}{2}(3)(4) = 6$. There are four right triangles, so the total shaded area is $4(6) = \\boxed{24}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understanding the Diagram**\nThe diagram shows a large square with a smaller square inside. The shaded region is the area between the two squares.  The side lengths of the outer square are labeled with consecutive integers: *a*, *b*, and *c*.  The side lengths of the inner square are all *c*.\n**2. Finding the Area of the Outer Square**\nThe area of the outer square is side * side = *b* * *b* = *b*\u00b2\n**3. Finding the Area of the Inner Square**\nThe area of the inner square is side * side = *c* * *c* = *c*\u00b2\n**4. Finding the Area of the Shaded Region**\nThe area of the shaded region is the difference between the area of the outer square and the area of the inner square:\nArea of shaded region = *b*\u00b2 - *c*\u00b2\n**5. Using the Relationship Between Consecutive Integers**\nSince *a*, *b*, and *c* are consecutive integers, we know that *b* = *a* + 1 and *c* = *a* + 2.  Let's substitute these values into our expression for the shaded area:\nArea of shaded region = (*a* + 1)\u00b2 - (*a* + 2)\u00b2\n**6. Simplifying the Expression**\nExpanding the squares and simplifying, we get:\nArea of shaded region = (a\u00b2 + 2a + 1) - (a\u00b2 + 4a + 4)\n                       = -2a - 3\n**Therefore, the area of the shaded region is -2a - 3.** \n**Important Note:** The area is expressed in terms of *a*. Since *a* represents an integer, the area of the shaded region will always be a negative number. This makes sense because the shaded region is the area *outside* the inner square, and we're subtracting a smaller area from a larger area. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Diagram**\n* The diagram shows a large square with side length *a + b + c*. \n* Inside, there's a smaller square with side length *c*. \n* The shaded region is the area between the large square and the smaller square.\n**2. Find the Area of the Large Square**\n* The area of a square is side length squared.\n* The large square has a side length of *a + b + c*, so its area is (a + b + c)^2.\n**3. Find the Area of the Small Square**\n* The small square has a side length of *c*, so its area is *c^2*.\n**4. Find the Area of the Shaded Region**\n* The area of the shaded region is the difference between the area of the large square and the area of the small square.\n* Area of shaded region = (a + b + c)^2 - c^2\n**5. Simplify the Expression**\n* We can simplify the expression using the difference of squares factorization: (a + b + c)^2 - c^2 = (a + b + c + c)(a + b + c - c)\n* This simplifies to (a + b + 2c)(a + b)\n**Therefore, the area of the shaded region is (a + b + 2c)(a + b).** \n",
        "Here's how we can solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Diagram:**\n* The diagram shows a large square divided into four smaller squares.\n* The shaded region is formed by four triangles, each with a base of length 'c' and a height of length 'a' or 'b'. \n**2. Area of a Triangle:**\n* The area of a triangle is given by: (1/2) * base * height\n**3. Area of the Shaded Region:**\n* **Area of one triangle:** (1/2) * c * a \n* **Area of another triangle:** (1/2) * c * b \n* **Total area of shaded region:** 2 * [(1/2) * c * a] + 2 * [(1/2) * c * b] = c * a + c * b\n**4. Simplify using Consecutive Integers:**\n* Since a, b, and c are consecutive integers, we can express 'b' as (a+1) and 'c' as (a+2).\n* Substituting these values, the area of the shaded region becomes: \n   (a+2) * a + (a+2) * (a+1) = a^2 + 2a + a^2 + 3a + 2 = 2a^2 + 5a + 2 \n**Therefore, the area of the shaded region is 2a^2 + 5a + 2, where 'a' is the smallest of the three consecutive integers.** \n",

Relate the Side Lengths**\n* Since 'a', 'b', and 'c' are consecutive integers, we know that:\n    *  b = a + 1\n    *  c = a + 2\n**3. Find the Area of a Triangle**\n* Each shaded triangle has a base of 'c' and a height of 'c'. \n* The area of a triangle is (1/2) * base * height, so the area of one triangle is: (1/2) * c * c = (1/2) * c^2\n**4. Find the Area of the Shaded Region**\n* Since there are four triangles, the total shaded area is: 4 * (1/2) * c^2 = 2 * c^2\n**5. Substitute and Simplify**\n* Substitute c = a + 2 into the expression: 2 * (a + 2)^2 \n* Expand: 2 * (a^2 + 4a + 4) = 2a^2 + 8a + 8\n**Therefore, the area of the shaded region is 2a^2 + 8a + 8 square units.** \n",
