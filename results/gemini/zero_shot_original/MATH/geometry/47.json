        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Problem**\nImagine a regular tetrahedron, which is a pyramid with four equilateral triangular faces.  Let $M$ be the midpoint of one of the base edges, say $\\overline{CD}$. We want to find the tangent of the angle formed by connecting the apex ($A$) to the midpoint ($M$) and then to the other end of the base edge ($B$).\n**2. Use Geometry**\n* **Equilateral Triangle:** Since $ABCD$ is a regular tetrahedron, triangle $ACD$ is equilateral. This means $AM = AD/2$.\n* **Right Triangle:** Triangle $AMB$ is a right triangle with right angle at $M$. This is because $AM$ is the median of the equilateral triangle, so it's also an altitude.\n**3. Set Up the Tangent Ratio**\nRecall that the tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side. In triangle $AMB$, we have:\n* **Opposite:** $BM$ \n* **Adjacent:** $AM$\nTherefore, $\\tan \\angle AMB = \\frac{BM}{AM}$.\n**4. Find BM and AM**\n* **BM:**  Since $M$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{CD}$, we have $BM = \\frac{1}{2} BD$. \n* **AM:**  As we noted earlier, $AM = \\frac{1}{2} AD$.\n**5. Express the Ratio in Terms of Side Length**\nLet's assume the side length of the tetrahedron is $s$.  Then:\n* $BD = s$ (side of the equilateral base)\n* $AD = s$ (side of the equilateral face)\nSubstituting these values into the tangent ratio:\n$\\tan \\angle AMB = \\frac{BM}{AM} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} BD}{\\frac{1}{2} AD} = \\frac{s/2}{s/2} = \\boxed{1}$ \n**Therefore, the tangent of angle AMB is 1.** \n",

Use Geometry**\n* **Equilateral Triangles:**  Since ABCD is a regular tetrahedron, all faces are equilateral triangles.  Therefore,  AC = AD = BC = BD = CD.\n* **Midpoint:**  M is the midpoint of CD, so CM = MD = CD/2.\n* **Right Triangle:**  Consider triangle AMD.  Since AD = CD and MD = CD/2, triangle AMD is a 30-60-90 right triangle (with angle MAD = 60 degrees and angle AMD = 90 degrees).\n**4. Find Relevant Side Lengths**\n* **AM:** In triangle AMD,  AM = AD * \u221a3 / 2 = (CD * \u221a3) / 2 \n* **BM:**  Since triangle BCD is equilateral,  BM is an altitude and therefore a median.  Hence, BM = (\u221a3 / 2) * CD.\n**5. Calculate the Tangent**\n* **Tangent:**  tan(\u2220AMB) = (AM) / (BM) = [(CD * \u221a3)/2] / [(\u221a3 / 2) * CD] = **1**\n**Therefore, the answer is  1.** \n",
        "Here's a step-by-step solution to find $\\tan \\angle AMB$:\n**1. Visualize the Tetrahedron**\nImagine a regular tetrahedron, where all four faces are equilateral triangles.  Label the vertices A, B, C, and D.  Let M be the midpoint of edge CD.\n**2.  Focus on Triangle AMB**\nWe want to find the tangent of angle AMB.  This means we need to consider triangle AMB.  \n**3.  Find the Lengths of AM and MB**\n* **Equilateral Triangles:** Since ABCD is a regular tetrahedron, all the faces are equilateral triangles.  \n* **Midpoint:**  M is the midpoint of CD, so CM = MD = (1/2) * CD.\n* **Pythagorean Theorem:** In right triangle AMC (or AMD), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find AM:  AM\u00b2 = AC\u00b2 - CM\u00b2 = AC\u00b2 - (1/4)CD\u00b2.  Since AC = CD (sides of equilateral triangles), AM\u00b2 = (3/4)CD\u00b2.  Therefore, AM = (\u221a3/2)CD.\n* **Similarly:**  We can find MB = (\u221a3/2)CD.\n**4.  Find the Length of AB**\n* **Equilateral Triangles:** AB is an edge of the tetrahedron, so AB = CD.\n**5.  Use the Law of Cosines**\n* **Triangle AMB:**  We can use the Law of Cosines to find the angle AMB:\n    * AB\u00b2 = AM\u00b2 + MB\u00b2 - 2(AM)(MB)cos(AMB)\n    * Substitute the values we found:  CD\u00b2 = (3/4)CD\u00b2 + (3/4)CD\u00b2 - 2((\u221a3/2)CD)((\u221a3/2)CD)cos(AMB)\n    * Simplify:  CD\u00b2 = (3/2)CD\u00b2 - (3/2)CD\u00b2cos(AMB)\n    * Solve for cos(AMB):  cos(AMB) = 1/2\n**6.  Find the Tangent**\n* **Trigonometric Identity:**  We know that tan\u00b2\u03b8 + 1 = sec\u00b2\u03b8.  Since sec\u03b8 = 1/cos\u03b8, we have tan\u00b2\u03b8 + 1 = 1/cos\u00b2\u03b8.\n* **Solve for tan\u03b8:**  tan\u00b2\u03b8 = (1/cos\u00b2\u03b8) - 1.  Substituting cos(AMB) = 1/2, we get tan\u00b2\u03b8 = 3.\n* **Positive Tangent:**  Since angle AMB is acute (in a triangle),  tan(AMB) = \u221a3.\n**Therefore, tan(AMB) = \u221a3.** \n",
