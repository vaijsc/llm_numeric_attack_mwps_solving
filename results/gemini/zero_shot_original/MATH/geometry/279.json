        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Octagon**\nImagine an equiangular octagon. Since all angles are equal, each angle measures 135 degrees (360 degrees / 8 sides = 45 degrees per side, and each angle is formed by two sides).  The octagon can be divided into 8 congruent isosceles triangles, with the center of the octagon as the common vertex.\n**2. Focus on One Triangle**\nConsider one of these isosceles triangles.  It has two sides of length 1 and one side of length $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$.  We can split this triangle into two right triangles by drawing an altitude from the vertex with the angle of 135 degrees to the base of length $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$.\n**3. Use Geometry and Trigonometry**\n* **Right Triangles:** Each right triangle has a hypotenuse of length 1, one leg of length $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{4}$ (half of the base of the isosceles triangle), and the other leg (the altitude) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem: \n   *  $1^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{4}\\right)^2 + \\text{altitude}^2$\n   *  $\\text{altitude}^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{7}{8}$\n   *  $\\text{altitude} = \\sqrt{\\frac{7}{8}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{14}}{4}$\n* **Area of Isosceles Triangle:** The area of the isosceles triangle is: \n    *  (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * ($\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$) * ($\\frac{\\sqrt{14}}{4}$) = $\\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{8}$\n**4. Area of the Octagon**\nSince there are eight congruent isosceles triangles, the area of the octagon is:\n* 8 * (Area of one triangle) = 8 * $\\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{8} = \\boxed{\\sqrt{7}}$ \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Octagon**\nImagine an equiangular octagon with alternating sides of length 1 and $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$.  You can think of it as a regular octagon with some sides \"pushed in\" or \"pushed out\" to create the alternating lengths.\n**2. Divide the Octagon**\nDivide the octagon into smaller shapes that we can easily calculate the area of.  The most helpful way to do this is to draw in the diagonals that connect opposite vertices.  This divides the octagon into eight congruent isosceles triangles.\n**3. Analyze the Triangles**\n* Each isosceles triangle has a base of length 1 (the shorter side of the octagon) and two legs of length $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$ (the longer side of the octagon).\n* Since the octagon is equiangular, each interior angle of the octagon measures $135^\\circ$.  Each triangle therefore has two base angles of $67.5^\\circ$ and a vertex angle of $45^\\circ$.\n**4. Calculate the Area of One Triangle**\nWe can use the formula for the area of a triangle:\nArea = (1/2) * base * height\nTo find the height, we can draw an altitude from the vertex angle to the base.  This altitude divides the triangle into two congruent right triangles.  Each right triangle has a hypotenuse of length $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$ and a base of length 1/2.  By the Pythagorean Theorem, the height is:\nheight = \u221a[($\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$)^2 - (1/2)^2] = \u221a(1/2) = $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$\nTherefore, the area of one triangle is:\nArea = (1/2) * 1 * $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$ = $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{4}$\n**5. Calculate the Total Area**\nSince the octagon is composed of eight of these congruent triangles, its total area is:\nTotal Area = 8 * $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{4}$ = **2\u221a2** \n**Therefore, the area of the octagon is 2\u221a2 square units.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Octagon**\nImagine an octagon with alternating side lengths of 1 and \u221a2/2.  Since it's equiangular, all angles are equal.  It might be helpful to sketch it out.\n**2. Divide the Octagon**\nDraw lines connecting opposite vertices of the octagon. This divides the octagon into eight congruent isosceles triangles.\n**3. Analyze One Triangle**\nFocus on one of these triangles.  Let's label the side lengths as follows:\n* The base of the triangle is a side of the octagon, so it's either 1 or \u221a2/2.\n* The two equal sides of the isosceles triangle are the diagonals of the octagon. Let's call the length of these sides 's'.\n**4. Use Law of Cosines**\nSince we know all the angles in the octagon are equal, each angle in the isosceles triangle is 180\u00b0/8 = 22.5\u00b0.  We can use the Law of Cosines to relate the side lengths of the triangle:\n* s\u00b2 = s\u00b2 + s\u00b2 - 2(s)(s)cos(22.5\u00b0)\n* 0 = s\u00b2 - 2s\u00b2cos(22.5\u00b0)\n* s\u00b2 = 2s\u00b2cos(22.5\u00b0)\n* cos(22.5\u00b0) = 1/2\n**5. Find the Base of the Triangle**\nSince cos(22.5\u00b0) = 1/2, we know the base of the triangle is \u221a2/2.  (This is because the base is the side opposite the angle, and the cosine of that angle is 1/2).\n**6. Find the Height of the Triangle**\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem on one half of the isosceles triangle:\n* (\u221a2/4)\u00b2 + h\u00b2 = (\u221a2/2)\u00b2\n* 1/8 + h\u00b2 = 1/2\n* h\u00b2 = 3/8\n* h = \u221a3/2\u221a2\n**7. Calculate the Area of the Triangle**\nArea of a triangle = (1/2) * base * height\n* Area = (1/2) * (\u221a2/2) * (\u221a3/2\u221a2) \n* Area = \u221a3/8\n**8. Calculate the Area of the Octagon**\nSince the octagon is made of eight congruent triangles:\n* Area of octagon = 8 * (Area of one triangle)\n* Area of octagon = 8 * (\u221a3/8)\n* **Area of octagon = \u221a3**\n**Therefore, the area of the octagon is \u221a3.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Octagon**\nImagine an equiangular octagon where the sides alternate in length: 1, \u221a2/2, 1, \u221a2/2, and so on.  You can draw a rough sketch to help visualize this.\n**2. Divide the Octagon**\nWe can divide the octagon into smaller shapes to make calculating the area easier. The most helpful division is to draw lines connecting the midpoints of each of the sides of length 1. This creates a central square with side length \u221a2/2.\n[asy]\nunitsize(1 cm);\npair A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H;\nA = (0,0);\nB = (1,0);\nC = (1 + sqrt(2)/2,sqrt(2)/2);\nD = (sqrt(2)/2,sqrt(2)/2);\nE = (0,1);\nF = (-sqrt(2)/2,sqrt(2)/2);\nG = (-1,0);\nH = (-1 - sqrt(2)/2,-sqrt(2)/2);\ndraw(A--B--C--D--E--F--G--H--cycle);\ndraw(B--D--F--H);\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, SW);\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, SE);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, NE);\nlabel(\"$D$\", D, N);\nlabel(\"$E$\", E, NW);\nlabel(\"$F$\", F, W);\nlabel(\"$G$\", G, SW);\nlabel(\"$H$\", H, S);\n[/asy]\n**3. Identify the Smaller Shapes**\nNow we have:\n* **One square:** The central square has side length \u221a2/2.\n* **Four congruent isosceles right triangles:** Each triangle has legs of length \u221a2/2 and hypotenuse of length 1.\n**4. Calculate Areas**\n* **Area of square:** (\u221a2/2)\u00b2 = 1/2\n* **Area of each triangle:** (1/2) * (\u221a2/2) * (\u221a2/2) = 1/4\n**5. Total Area**\nThe total area of the octagon is:\nArea of square + 4 * Area of triangle = 1/2 + 4 * (1/4) = **1.5**\n**Therefore, the area of the octagon is 1.5 square units.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Octagon**\nImagine an equiangular octagon. Since all angles are equal, each angle measures 135 degrees (360 degrees / 8 sides = 45 degrees per angle, and the octagon is equiangular, so each angle is 45 * 3 = 135 degrees). \nWe can arrange the sides of length 1 and \u221a2/2 to form a repeating pattern: 1, \u221a2/2, 1, \u221a2/2, etc.\n**2. Divide the Octagon into Triangles**\nDraw diagonals from one vertex of the octagon to the alternate vertices. This will divide the octagon into six congruent isosceles triangles.\n**3. Analyze the Triangles**\nEach isosceles triangle has:\n* Two sides of length 1\n* One side of length \u221a2/2\n* Two equal base angles of 45 degrees \n* A vertex angle of 90 degrees (135 degrees - 45 degrees - 45 degrees = 45 degrees)\n**4. Calculate the Area of a Triangle**\nSince the vertex angle is 90 degrees, each isosceles triangle is a 45-45-90 right triangle.  \n* **Hypotenuse:** \u221a2/2\n* **Legs:** 1/2 (because the hypotenuse is \u221a2 times the length of a leg in a 45-45-90 triangle)\nThe area of a triangle is (1/2) * base * height. So, the area of one triangle is:\n(1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8\n**5. Calculate the Total Area**\nSince there are six congruent triangles, the total area of the octagon is:\n6 * (1/8) = **3/4**\n**Therefore, the area of the octagon is 3/4 square units.** \n"
