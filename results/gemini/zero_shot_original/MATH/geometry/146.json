        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Understand Isosceles Trapezoids**\n* **Parallel Sides:** An isosceles trapezoid has one pair of parallel sides.\n* **Equal Legs:** The non-parallel sides (legs) are equal in length.\n* **Equal Base Angles:**  The angles at the ends of each of the parallel sides are equal.\n**2. Use Angle Relationships**\n* **Consecutive Interior Angles:** When a transversal intersects two parallel lines, the consecutive interior angles on the same side of the transversal are supplementary (add up to 180 degrees).\n* **Trapezoid Angles:** Since the trapezoid has parallel sides, we can apply the consecutive interior angle rule. \n**3. Solve for Obtuse Angles**\n* **Step 1:**  One acute angle is 40 degrees.  The consecutive interior angle on the same side of the trapezoid is also an acute angle and also measures 40 degrees.\n* **Step 2:**  Since these two angles are supplementary, the obtuse angle next to them must measure 180 - 40 - 40 = 100 degrees.\n* **Step 3:** The trapezoid is isosceles, so the other obtuse angle also measures 100 degrees.\n**Answer:** Each obtuse angle in the trapezoid measures **100 degrees**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the properties of an isosceles trapezoid:**\n* **Parallel sides:**  An isosceles trapezoid has one pair of parallel sides (the bases).\n* **Equal legs:** The non-parallel sides (legs) are equal in length.\n* **Equal base angles:** The angles at each end of a base are equal.\n**2. Visualize the trapezoid:**\nImagine an isosceles trapezoid.  Since the acute angles are 40 degrees each, we can label them as follows:\n   *  Top left angle = 40 degrees\n   *  Top right angle = 40 degrees \n**3. Use angle relationships:**\n* **Interior angles of a quadrilateral:** The sum of the interior angles of any quadrilateral is 360 degrees.\n* **Supplementary angles:**  Two angles are supplementary if they add up to 180 degrees.\n**4. Calculate the obtuse angles:**\n* **Angle pairs:** Since the trapezoid is isosceles, the two obtuse angles are equal. Let's call each obtuse angle 'x'.\n* **Equation:**  We can set up an equation to represent the sum of the angles:  40 + 40 + x + x = 360 \n* **Solve for x:**  Simplify and solve for 'x': 80 + 2x = 360  -->  2x = 280  -->  x = 140\n**Answer:**  Each obtuse angle in the isosceles trapezoid measures **140 degrees**. \n",

Understanding Isosceles Trapezoids**\n* An isosceles trapezoid has two parallel sides (bases) and two non-parallel sides of equal length.\n* The angles at each base are congruent (equal).\n**2. Using Angle Properties**\n* **Angles on a Straight Line:**  The angles on a straight line add up to 180 degrees.\n* **Parallel Lines:** When a transversal (a line that crosses two parallel lines) cuts through parallel lines, alternate interior angles are congruent. \n**3. Solving the Problem**\n* **Find the obtuse angle:**  Let's focus on one of the obtuse angles. It forms a straight line with the acute angle of 40 degrees.  \n* **Calculate the obtuse angle:** Since the angles on a straight line add up to 180 degrees, the obtuse angle measures 180 - 40 = 140 degrees.\n**4.
