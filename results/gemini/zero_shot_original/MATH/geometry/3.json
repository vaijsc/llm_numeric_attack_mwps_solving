        "Here's how to solve the problem step by step:\n**1. Find the height of triangle ABC:**\n* Since the area of a triangle is (1/2) * base * height, we know: 180 = (1/2) * 12 * height\n* Solving for the height, we get: height = 30\n**2. Understand the relationship between triangles ABC and ADE:**\n* Since AB || DE, triangles ABC and ADE are similar.  This means their corresponding sides are proportional, and their corresponding angles are equal.\n**3.  Find the ratio of corresponding sides:**\n* Since AD is an altitude of triangle ABC, it bisects BC.  Therefore, BD = DC = 6.\n* Because triangles ABC and ADE are similar, we have the proportion: AB/DE = BC/DC = 12/6 = 2. \n* This means DE is half the length of AB.\n**4.  Find the height of triangle ADE:**\n* Since the height of triangle ABC is 30, and DE is half the length of AB, the height of triangle ADE is also half the height of triangle ABC. \n* Therefore, the height of triangle ADE is 30/2 = 15.\n**5. Calculate the area of triangle ADE:**\n* The base of triangle ADE is DE, which is half the length of AB. Since AB is also the base of triangle ABC, the base of triangle ADE is 12/2 = 6.\n* The area of triangle ADE is (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 6 * 15 = 45.\n**6. Calculate the area of ABDE:**\n* The area of ABDE is the area of triangle ABC minus the area of triangle ADE.\n* Area of ABDE = 180 - 45 = 135.\n**Therefore, the area of quadrilateral ABDE is 135.** \n",

Recognize that AD is the height of triangle ABC:**\n* Since AD is an altitude, it's perpendicular to BC, which means it's the height of triangle ABC.\n**3. Determine the relationship between triangle ADE and triangle ABC:**\n* Since AB || DE, triangles ADE and ABC are similar. This means their corresponding sides are proportional, and their corresponding angles are equal.\n**4. Use the similarity to find the height of triangle ADE:**\n* Let the length of DE be x. Since AB || DE, the height of triangle ADE is also the distance between AB and DE, which is the same as the height of triangle ABC (30).\n**5. Calculate the area of triangle ADE:**\n* Area of triangle ADE = (1/2) * DE * height = (1/2) * x * 30 = 15x\n**6. Calculate the area of ABDE:**\n* Area of ABDE = Area of triangle ABC - Area of triangle ADE\n* Area of ABDE = 180 - 15x\n**7. We need to find x (the length of DE):**\n* Since triangles ADE and ABC are similar, the ratio of their corresponding sides is the same.  \n* Therefore, DE/BC = AD/AC. \n* We know BC = 12 and AD is the height of triangle ABC (30). Since AB = AC, we can write the proportion as: x/12 = 30/AC.\n* We need to find AC.  \n* We can use the Pythagorean theorem on right triangle ABD (or ACD):  \n* AC\u00b2 = AD\u00b2 + BD\u00b2 = 30\u00b2 + (BC/2)\u00b2 = 30\u00b2 + 6\u00b2 = 936\n* AC = \u221a936 = 6\u221a26\n* Now we can solve for x:  x/12 = 30/(6\u221a26) => x = 60/\u221a26\n**8. Substitute x to find the area of ABDE:**\n* Area of ABDE = 180 - 15x = 180 - 15(60/\u221a26) = 180 - 900/\u221a26 \n**9. Simplify the answer:**\n* Area of ABDE =  **180 - (900/\u221a26)** \nTherefore, the area of quadrilateral ABDE is **180 - (900/\u221a26) square units**. \n",

Determine the base of triangle ADE**\n* Let AE = x. Since AB = AC, and AC = AE + EC, we have AB = x + EC.\n* Since AB || DE,  DE = x (corresponding sides of similar triangles).\n**5. Calculate the area of triangle ADE**\n* Area of triangle ADE = (1/2) * base * height\n* Area of triangle ADE = (1/2) * x * 30 = 15x\n**6. Find the area of ABDE**\n* ABDE is a trapezoid.\n* Area of a trapezoid = (1/2) * height * (sum of bases)\n* Area of ABDE = (1/2) * 30 * (x + x + EC) = 15(2x + EC)\n* Since AB = AC = x + EC, we can rewrite this as Area of ABDE = 15(2x + (AC - x)) = 15(x + AC)\n**7. Use the area of triangle ABC to find AC**\n* Area of triangle ABC = (1/2) * BC * AC = 180\n* 180 = (1/2) * 12 * AC\n* AC = 30\n**8. Substitute AC into the area of ABDE**\n* Area of ABDE = 15(x + AC) = 15(x + 30)\n**9. We don't have enough information to find x (AE)**\n*  Without additional information, we can't determine the exact value of x (AE). Therefore, we can't find the exact area of ABDE.\n**Final Answer:** The area of ABDE is **15(x + 30)**, where x represents the length of AE. \n",
