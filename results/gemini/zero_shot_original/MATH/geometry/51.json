Unit Circle:**\n* Imagine the unit circle (a circle with radius 1 centered at the origin).\n*  Angles are measured counterclockwise from the positive x-axis.\n**2. Finding the Point:**\n* Rotate 120 degrees counterclockwise from the positive x-axis.  You'll end up in the second quadrant. \n* The point on the unit circle corresponding to 120 degrees is  (-1/2, \u221a3/2).\n**3. Cosine as the x-coordinate:**\n* Remember that the cosine of an angle is represented by the x-coordinate of the point on the unit circle.\n**Therefore:** \n*  $\\cos 120^\\circ = \\boxed{-\\frac{1}{2}}$ \n",
        "1. **Visualize the angle:**  Imagine the unit circle (a circle with radius 1 centered at the origin).  120 degrees is in the second quadrant,  two-thirds of the way from the positive x-axis to the negative x-axis.\n2. **Find the reference angle:** The reference angle is the acute angle formed between the terminal side of the angle and the x-axis. In this case, the reference angle is 60 degrees (180 - 120 = 60).\n3. **Determine the cosine of the reference angle:** We know that cos 60\u00b0 = 1/2.\n4. **Consider the quadrant:** Cosine is negative in the second quadrant.\n5. **Combine the information:** Since the cosine of the reference angle is 1/2 and cosine is negative in the second quadrant,  cos 120\u00b0 = **-1/2**. \n",
