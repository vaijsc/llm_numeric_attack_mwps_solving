    "solution": "Suppose that $\\angle ADC = x^\\circ$. The area of the unshaded portion of the inner circle is thus $\\frac x{360}$ of the total area of the inner circle, or $\\frac x{360}(\\pi(1^2)) = \\frac x{360} \\pi$ (since $\\angle ADC$ is $\\frac x{360}$ of the largest possible central angle ($360^\\circ$)).\n\nThe area of shaded portion of the inner circle is thus $$\\pi - \\frac x{360}\\pi = \\frac{360 - x}{360}\\pi.$$ The total area of the outer ring is the difference of the areas of the outer and inner circles, or $\\pi(2^2) - \\pi(1^2) = 3\\pi$. The shaded region of the outer ring will be $\\frac x{360}$ of this total area. So the shaded region of the outer ring is $\\frac x{360} (3\\pi) = \\frac{3x}{360}\\pi$.\n\nSo the total shaded area (which must equal $\\frac53 \\pi$) is, in terms of $x$, $$\\frac{3x}{360} \\pi + \\frac{360 - x}{360} \\pi = \\frac{360 + 2x}{360} \\pi.$$ Therefore, $$\\frac{360 + 2x}{360} = \\frac53 = \\frac{600}{360},$$ so $360 + 2x = 600$, or $x = \\boxed{120}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the areas of the circles:**\n* The area of the smaller circle is $\\pi (1^2) = \\pi$.\n* The area of the larger circle is $\\pi (2^2) = 4\\pi$.\n**2. Calculate the area of the shaded region:**\n* The shaded region is $\\frac{5}{12}$ of the larger circle's area, so its area is $\\frac{5}{12}(4\\pi) = \\frac{5}{3}\\pi$.\n**3. Determine the area of the sector:**\n* The shaded region consists of two sectors of the larger circle and a smaller circle. \n* The area of the smaller circle is $\\pi$.  \n* Therefore, the combined area of the two sectors is $\\frac{5}{3}\\pi - \\pi = \\frac{2}{3}\\pi$.\n**4. Relate the sector area to the central angle:**\n* The area of a sector is a fraction of the circle's area, determined by the ratio of the central angle to 360 degrees. \n* Let $x$ be the measure of $\\angle ADC$.  Then the area of the two sectors is $\\frac{x}{360^\\circ}(4\\pi) = \\frac{x}{90^\\circ}\\pi$.\n**5. Set up an equation and solve:**\n* We know the area of the two sectors is $\\frac{2}{3}\\pi$.  So, we have the equation: \n  $\\frac{x}{90^\\circ}\\pi = \\frac{2}{3}\\pi$\n* Multiply both sides by $\\frac{90^\\circ}{\\pi}$ to get:\n  $x = \\boxed{60^\\circ}$ \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the areas of the circles:**\n* The area of the smaller circle is  \u03c0(1)\u00b2 = \u03c0.\n* The area of the larger circle is \u03c0(2)\u00b2 = 4\u03c0.\n**2. Calculate the area of the shaded region:**\n* Since the shaded region is 5/12 of the larger circle's area, its area is (5/12)(4\u03c0) = (5/3)\u03c0.\n**3. Determine the area of the non-shaded region of the larger circle:**\n* The area of the non-shaded region of the larger circle is the difference between the larger circle's area and the shaded region's area: 4\u03c0 - (5/3)\u03c0 = (7/3)\u03c0.\n**4.  Recognize the relationship between the shaded and non-shaded regions:**\n* The non-shaded region is a sector of the larger circle, and the shaded region is a sector of the larger circle minus a sector of the smaller circle.  The sectors share the same central angle,  \u2220ADC.\n**5. Set up a proportion:**\n* The ratio of the area of a sector to the area of the whole circle is equal to the ratio of the central angle of the sector to 360 degrees.  \n* We can write this as:  (Area of sector) / (Area of circle) = (Central angle) / 360\u00b0.\n**6. Apply the proportion to our problem:**\n* For the non-shaded sector of the larger circle:  (7/3)\u03c0 / 4\u03c0 = \u2220ADC / 360\u00b0\n* For the shaded sector of the larger circle minus the shaded sector of the smaller circle: (5/3)\u03c0 / 4\u03c0 - (5/3)\u03c0 / \u03c0 = \u2220ADC / 360\u00b0 \n**7. Solve for \u2220ADC:**\n* Simplifying the first equation: (7/12) = \u2220ADC / 360\u00b0 \n* Solving for \u2220ADC:  \u2220ADC = (7/12)(360\u00b0) = 210\u00b0\n**8.  Find the smaller angle:**\n* Since the larger angle is 210\u00b0, the smaller angle \u2220ADC is 360\u00b0 - 210\u00b0 = **150\u00b0**. \n",
        "**1. Find the areas of the circles:**\n* The area of the smaller circle is  \u03c0(1)\u00b2 = \u03c0.\n* The area of the larger circle is \u03c0(2)\u00b2 = 4\u03c0.\n**2. Find the area of the shaded region:**\n* Since the shaded region is 5/12 of the area of the larger circle, its area is (5/12)(4\u03c0) = (5/3)\u03c0.\n**3. Find the area of the unshaded region of the larger circle:**\n* The unshaded region of the larger circle is the area of the larger circle minus the area of the shaded region: 4\u03c0 - (5/3)\u03c0 = (7/3)\u03c0.\n**4.  Find the area of the sector formed by angle ADC in the larger circle:**\n* The unshaded region of the larger circle consists of two parts: the sector formed by angle ADC and the smaller circle.  \n* The area of the sector is (7/3)\u03c0 - \u03c0 = (4/3)\u03c0.\n**5. Relate the sector's area to the measure of angle ADC:**\n* The area of a sector is a fraction of the area of the whole circle, with the fraction being equal to the measure of the central angle divided by 360 degrees.  In this case, the central angle is angle ADC.  So we have:\n   (4/3)\u03c0 / (4\u03c0) =  \u2220ADC / 360\u00b0\n**6. Solve for the measure of angle ADC:**\n* Simplifying the equation, we get: 1/3 = \u2220ADC / 360\u00b0. \n* Multiplying both sides by 360\u00b0 gives us: \u2220ADC = 120\u00b0.\n**Therefore, the measure of angle ADC is 120 degrees.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the area of the larger circle:**\n* The radius of the larger circle is 2.\n* The area of a circle is given by \u03c0r\u00b2, so the area of the larger circle is \u03c0(2)\u00b2 = 4\u03c0.\n**2. Find the area of the shaded region:**\n* We are told the shaded region is 5/12 of the area of the larger circle.\n* Therefore, the area of the shaded region is (5/12)(4\u03c0) = (5/3)\u03c0.\n**3. Understand the geometry:**\n* The shaded region consists of two segments of the circles.\n* Each segment is formed by a central angle (\u2220ADC) and its corresponding arc.\n* The area of each segment is the difference between the area of the corresponding sector and the area of the triangle formed by the center and the endpoints of the arc.\n**4. Set up an equation:**\n* Let x be the measure of \u2220ADC in degrees.\n* The area of the smaller sector (with radius 1) is (x/360)\u03c0(1\u00b2) = (x/360)\u03c0.\n* The area of the larger sector (with radius 2) is (x/360)\u03c0(2\u00b2) = (x/90)\u03c0.\n* The area of the triangle formed by the smaller sector is (1/2)(1)(1)sin(x) = (1/2)sin(x).\n* The area of the triangle formed by the larger sector is (1/2)(2)(2)sin(x) = 2sin(x). \n*  The total area of the shaded region is the sum of the two segments:  \n   [(x/360)\u03c0 - (1/2)sin(x)] + [(x/90)\u03c0 - 2sin(x)] = (5/3)\u03c0\n**5. Solve the equation:**\n* Simplify the equation: (5x/360)\u03c0 - (5/2)sin(x) = (5/3)\u03c0\n* Multiply both sides by 360 to get rid of the fractions: 5x\u03c0 - 900sin(x) = 600\u03c0\n* Divide both sides by 5\u03c0: x - 180sin(x) = 120\n* We can't solve for x directly, but we can use a graphing calculator or numerical methods to find an approximate solution.  The solution is approximately **x \u2248 120.96 degrees**.\n**6. Round to the nearest degree:**\n* Since we need the answer in degrees, we round 120.96 to the nearest whole number.\n**Therefore, the measure of \u2220ADC is approximately 121 degrees.** \n",

Find the area of the shaded region**\n* The shaded region is $\\frac{5}{12}$ of the larger circle's area, so its area is  $\\frac{5}{12} (4\\pi) = \\frac{5}{3} \\pi$.\n**3.
