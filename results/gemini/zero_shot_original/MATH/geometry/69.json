        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Recognize the Right Triangle**\nSince $CD$ is an altitude, we know that triangle $ACD$ is a right triangle with right angle at $D$.\n**2. Use the Pythagorean Theorem**\nWe can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of $AD$.  Let $x = AD$. Then by the Pythagorean Theorem on triangle $ACD$:\n*  $x^2 + CD^2 = 8^2$\n**3. Use the Pythagorean Theorem Again**\nWe can also use the Pythagorean Theorem on triangle $BCD$ to find $CD$.  Let $y = BD$. Then:\n* $y^2 + CD^2 = 15^2$\n**4. Find a Relationship Between x and y**\nNotice that $x + y = 17$ (the length of side $AB$).\n**5. Solve the System of Equations**\nWe now have three equations and three unknowns:\n*  $x^2 + CD^2 = 64$\n*  $y^2 + CD^2 = 225$\n*  $x + y = 17$\nSolve for $x$ and $y$ using substitution or elimination.  Here's how using substitution:\n* From the third equation,  $y = 17 - x$.\n* Substitute this into the second equation: $(17 - x)^2 + CD^2 = 225$.\n* Simplify: $289 - 34x + x^2 + CD^2 = 225$.\n* Subtract the first equation ($x^2 + CD^2 = 64$) from this equation: $225 - 34x = 161$.\n* Solve for $x$: $x = 2$.\n**6. Find CD**\nSubstitute $x = 2$ into the equation $x^2 + CD^2 = 64$:\n*  $2^2 + CD^2 = 64$\n*  $CD^2 = 60$\n*  $CD = \\sqrt{60} = 2\\sqrt{15}$\n**7. Calculate the Area**\nFinally, the area of triangle $ACD$ is:\n*  $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot AD \\cdot CD = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2\\sqrt{15} = \\boxed{2\\sqrt{15}}$. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Recognize a Right Triangle**\nSince we have an altitude drawn, we know that triangle $ACD$ is a right triangle with right angle at $D$.\n**2. Use the Pythagorean Theorem**\nWe can use the Pythagorean Theorem on triangle $ABC$ to find the length of altitude $CD$:\n* $AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2$\n* $17^2 = 8^2 + 15^2$ \n* $289 = 64 + 225$\n* $289 = 289$\nThis confirms that triangle $ABC$ is indeed a right triangle with right angle at $C$. Since $CD$ is an altitude, it's the same as the length of $BC$, which is 15.\n**3. Calculate the Area of Triangle ACD**\nNow that we know the base ($AD$) and height ($CD$) of triangle $ACD$, we can calculate its area:\n* Area of triangle $ACD = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot AD \\cdot CD$\nTo find $AD$, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem on triangle $ACD$:\n* $AC^2 = AD^2 + CD^2$\n* $8^2 = AD^2 + 15^2$\n* $64 = AD^2 + 225$\n* $AD^2 = -161$ \nSince we get a negative value for $AD^2$, this means there's an error in our calculations. Let's go back and check our work.\n**4. Identifying the Error**\nThe error lies in assuming that $CD$ is the same as $BC$.  While $CD$ is an altitude,  $BC$ is the hypotenuse of the right triangle. \n**5. Correcting the Calculation**\nLet's try again to find $CD$ using the Pythagorean Theorem on triangle $ACD$:\n* $AC^2 = AD^2 + CD^2$\n* $8^2 = AD^2 + CD^2$\nTo find $AD$, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem on triangle $ABD$:\n* $AB^2 = AD^2 + BD^2$\n* $17^2 = AD^2 + BD^2$\nSince we know $AB = 17$ and $BC = 15$, we can find $BD$:\n* $BD = AB - AD = 17 - AD$\nNow, substitute this value of $BD$ into the equation for $AB^2$:\n* $17^2 = AD^2 + (17 - AD)^2$\n* $289 = AD^2 + 289 - 34AD + AD^2$\n* $0 = 2AD^2 - 34AD$\n* $0 = 2AD(AD - 17)$\nThis gives us two possible solutions: $AD = 0$ or $AD = 17$.  Since $AD$ is a side length, it cannot be 0. Therefore, $AD = 17$. \nNow, we can substitute $AD = 17$ into the equation for $AC^2$:\n* $8^2 = 17^2 + CD^2$\n* $64 = 289 + CD^2$\n* $CD^2 = -225$\nAgain, we get a negative value for $CD^2$, indicating an error. This means our initial assumption that triangle $ABC$ is a right triangle was incorrect.\n**6. Recalculating the Area**\nSince triangle $ABC$ is not a right triangle, we need to use a different approach to find the area of triangle $ACD$. We can use Heron's formula to find the area of triangle $ABC$, and then use the formula for the area of a triangle:\n* **Heron's Formula:**  \n    Let $s$ be the semiperimeter of triangle $ABC$:\n    * $s = \\frac{AB + AC + BC}{2} = \\frac{17 + 8 + 15}{2} = 20$\n    * Area of triangle $ABC = \\sqrt{s(s - AB)(s - AC)(s - BC)} = \\sqrt{20(20 - 17)(20 - 8)(20 - 15)} = \\sqrt{20 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 12 \\cdot 5} = 60$\n* **Area of Triangle ACD:**\n    * Since triangle $ACD$ is a part of triangle $ABC$, we need to find the ratio of their bases.  We know that $AD = 17$ (from the Pythagorean Theorem on triangle $ABD$) and $AB = 17$.  Therefore, the base of triangle $ACD$ is the same as the base of triangle $ABC$.\n    * Area of triangle $ACD = \\frac{AD}{AB} \\cdot \\text{Area of triangle } ABC = \\frac{17}{17} \\cdot 60 = \\boxed{60}$.\nTherefore, the area of triangle $ACD$ is 60. \n",

Find the Area of Triangle $ACD$**\n* The area of a triangle is given by:\n   *  Area = (1/2) * base * height \n* In triangle $ACD$, we can take $AD$ as the base and $CD$ as the height.  \n**4. Use Heron's Formula to Find CD**\n*  We can find the area of triangle $ABC$ using Heron's formula:\n   *  Let $s$ be the semi-perimeter of triangle $ABC$: $s = (AB + BC + AC)/2 = (17 + 15 + 8)/2 = 20$\n   *  Area of triangle $ABC$ = $\\sqrt{s(s-AB)(s-BC)(s-AC)} = \\sqrt{20(20-17)(20-15)(20-8)} = 60$\n*  Since $CD$ is the altitude from $C$ to $AB$, the area of triangle $ABC$ can also be expressed as:\n   *  Area of triangle $ABC$ = (1/2) * $AB$ * $CD$\n   *  $60 = (1/2) * 17 * CD$\n   *  $CD = 120/17$\n**5. Solve for AD**\n*  Now we can substitute the value of $CD$ into the Pythagorean equation we found earlier:\n   *  $8^2 = AD^2 + (120/17)^2$\n   *  $AD^2 = 64 - (14400/289)$\n   *  $AD^2 = (18496 - 14400)/289$\n   *  $AD = \\sqrt{4096/289} = 64/17$\n**6. Calculate the Area of Triangle ACD**\n*  Finally, we can find the area of triangle $ACD$:\n   *  Area of triangle $ACD = (1/2) * AD * CD$\n   *  Area of triangle $ACD = (1/2) * (64/17) * (120/17)$\n   *  Area of triangle $ACD = \\boxed{\\frac{3840}{289}}$ \n",
