        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Visualize the Problem:**\nImagine the box. Point P is at the center of the bottom square base, and point Q is at a corner of the top square base.\n**2.  Find the Distance from P to the Center of the Top Base:**\n* Since the box is 8 cm thick, the distance from P to the center of the top base is simply 8 cm.\n**3. Find the Distance from the Center of the Top Base to Corner Q:**\n* The center of the top base is the center of a square with side length 32 cm. \n* Draw a diagonal from the center of this square to one of its corners. This diagonal splits the square into two right triangles.\n* The diagonal is the hypotenuse of the right triangle, and half the diagonal is the distance we want.\n* We can use the Pythagorean theorem:  (half diagonal)\u00b2 + (half side length)\u00b2 = (diagonal)\u00b2\n* Simplifying, we get: (half diagonal)\u00b2 + 16\u00b2 = 32\u00b2\n* Solving for (half diagonal)\u00b2, we get (half diagonal)\u00b2 = 32\u00b2 - 16\u00b2 = 16\u00b2 (8\u00b2 - 4\u00b2) = 16\u00b2 (64)\n* Taking the square root, we find half the diagonal is 16\u221a64 = 16 * 8 = 128 cm\n**4.  Find the Total Distance PQ:**\n* Now we can use the Pythagorean theorem again with the distance from P to the center of the top base (8 cm) and the distance from the center of the top base to corner Q (128 cm).\n*  PQ\u00b2 = 8\u00b2 + 128\u00b2 = 64 + 16384 = 16448\n*  PQ = \u221a16448 = \u221a(64 * 257) = 8\u221a257 cm\n**Therefore, the distance from P to Q is 8\u221a257 cm.** \n",

Using the Pythagorean Theorem, the diagonal has length  \u221a(32\u00b2 + 32\u00b2) = 32\u221a2 cm.\n3. **Form a right triangle:**  Connect point P to the center of the bottom base. This line segment, along with the height of the box (8 cm) and half the diagonal of the base (16\u221a2 cm), form a right triangle.\n4. **Use the Pythagorean Theorem:** The distance PQ is the hypotenuse of this right triangle.  Applying the Pythagorean Theorem:\n   PQ\u00b2 = 8\u00b2 + (16\u221a2)\u00b2 = 64 + 512 = 576\n5. **Find PQ:**  Taking the square root of both sides:\n   PQ = \u221a576 = **24 cm** \n",
