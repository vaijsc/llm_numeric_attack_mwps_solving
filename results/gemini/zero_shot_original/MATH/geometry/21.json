    "solution": "Using the Triangle Inequality, we see that the third side of a triangle with sides $3\\text{ cm}$ and $5\\text{ cm}$ must be larger than $2\\text{ cm}$ but smaller than $8\\text{ cm}.$ If the third side must be a whole centimeter length, and the triangle is scalene, that means that the only possible lengths for the third side are: $4\\text{ cm},$ $6\\text{ cm},$ and $7\\text{ cm}.$ That makes $\\boxed{3}$ possible lengths for the third side.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding the Triangle Inequality**\nThe Triangle Inequality Theorem states that the sum of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side.\n**Applying the Theorem**\n* **Smallest possible length:**  To find the smallest possible length for the third side, consider the difference between the two given sides: 5 cm - 3 cm = 2 cm.  The third side must be greater than 2 cm.\n* **Largest possible length:** To find the largest possible length, consider the sum of the two given sides: 5 cm + 3 cm = 8 cm. The third side must be less than 8 cm.\n**Possible Lengths**\nTherefore, the possible whole centimeter lengths for the third side are:\n* 3 cm\n* 4 cm\n* 5 cm\n* 6 cm\n* 7 cm\n**Answer:** There are **5** different whole centimeter lengths possible for the third side. \n",

        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding the Triangle Inequality**\nThe Triangle Inequality Theorem states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side.\n**Applying the Theorem**\n1. **Smallest Possible Side:** To find the smallest possible length for the third side, subtract the smaller side from the larger side: 5 cm - 3 cm = 2 cm.  However, the third side must be *greater* than 2 cm, so the smallest possible whole centimeter length is 3 cm.\n2. **Largest Possible Side:** To find the largest possible length for the third side, add the two smaller sides: 3 cm + 5 cm = 8 cm. The third side must be *less* than 8 cm, so the largest possible whole centimeter length is 7 cm.\n**Possible Lengths**\nTherefore, the possible whole centimeter lengths for the third side are: 3 cm, 4 cm, 5 cm, 6 cm, and 7 cm.\n**Answer:** There are **5** different whole centimeter lengths possible for the third side. \n",
