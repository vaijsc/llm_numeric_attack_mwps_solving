        "Here's a step-by-step solution:\n**1. Understanding the Geometry**\n* **Parallelograms:** The given lines form parallelograms because the slopes of the pairs of parallel lines are equal (the lines with slopes 'a' are parallel, and the lines with slopes 'b' are parallel).\n* **Base and Height:** The base of each parallelogram is the distance between the lines with slope 'a' or 'b'. The height is the perpendicular distance between the parallel lines.\n**2. Area of a Parallelogram**\nThe area of a parallelogram is given by:\nArea = Base \u00d7 Height\n**3. Analyzing the Information**\n* **First Parallelogram:** The area of the parallelogram bounded by the lines  $y=ax+c$, $y=ax+d$, $y=bx+c$, and $y=bx+d$ is 18. This means the distance between the lines $y=ax+c$ and $y=ax+d$ (which is 'd') multiplied by the distance between the lines $y=ax+c$ and $y=bx+c$ (which is the difference in the x-intercepts of these lines) equals 18. \n* **Second Parallelogram:** The area of the parallelogram bounded by the lines $y=ax+c$, $y=ax-d$, $y=bx+c$, and $y=bx-d$ is 72. This means the distance between the lines $y=ax+c$ and $y=ax-d$ (which is 2'd') multiplied by the distance between the lines $y=ax+c$ and $y=bx+c$ (same as before) equals 72.\n**4. Setting Up Equations**\nLet:\n*  'B' represent the distance between the lines with slope 'a' and the lines with slope 'b' (the base).\n*  'H' represent the distance between the lines with slopes 'a' (the height).\nWe can set up the following equations from the areas given:\n*  B \u00d7 d = 18\n*  B \u00d7 2d = 72\n**5. Solving for 'd' and 'B'**\nFrom the second equation, we get B \u00d7 d = 36.  Dividing this equation by the first equation, we get:\n(B \u00d7 d) / (B \u00d7 d) = 36 / 18 \n1 = 2\nThis is a contradiction! This means there's no solution that satisfies both area conditions with positive integer values for 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'. \n**Conclusion:**\nThere is no solution to the problem. It's likely there's an error in the problem statement. \n",
        "Here's a step-by-step solution to find the smallest possible value of  $a + b + c + d$:\n**Understanding the Parallelograms**\n* **Key Insight:** The lines with the same slope ($a$ or $b$) are parallel. This means the parallelograms are formed by pairs of parallel lines.\n* **Height and Base:** The distance between the parallel lines with slope $a$ represents the height of the parallelogram, and the distance between the parallel lines with slope $b$ represents the base.\n**Calculations**\n1. **Area of the first parallelogram:**  The distance between the lines $y = ax + c$ and $y = ax + d$ is simply $|d - c|$. Similarly, the distance between $y = bx + c$ and $y = bx + d$ is also $|d - c|$. \n   Therefore, the area of the first parallelogram is: \n   \n   *  $|d - c| \\cdot |d - c| = (d - c)^2 = 18$\n2. **Area of the second parallelogram:** The distance between the lines $y = ax + c$ and $y = ax - d$ is  $|d + c|$. The distance between $y = bx + c$ and $y = bx - d$ is also $|d + c|$.\n   Therefore, the area of the second parallelogram is:\n   *  $|d + c| \\cdot |d + c| = (d + c)^2 = 72$\n3. **Solving for c and d:**  We have two equations:\n   *  $(d - c)^2 = 18$\n   *  $(d + c)^2 = 72$\n   Taking the square root of both equations (note that we are considering only positive values):\n   *  $d - c = \\sqrt{18} = 3\\sqrt{2}$\n   *  $d + c = \\sqrt{72} = 6\\sqrt{2}$\n   Adding these equations:\n   *  $2d = 9\\sqrt{2}$ \n   *  $d = \\frac{9\\sqrt{2}}{2}$\n   Substituting this value of $d$ back into either equation, we get:\n   *  $c = \\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{2}$\n4. **Finding a and b:** To find the smallest possible values of $a$ and $b$, we need to minimize the distances between the parallel lines. Consider the slope of the line connecting the intersection points of the lines:\n   *  The intersection of $y = ax + c$ and $y = bx + c$ occurs at $x = 0$. \n   *  The intersection of $y = ax - d$ and $y = bx - d$ also occurs at $x = 0$.\n   *  Therefore, the slope of the line connecting these points is $\\frac{d - c}{0} = \\infty$.\n   To minimize the distances between the parallel lines, we need to maximize the slopes $a$ and $b$. The smallest possible integer values that satisfy this condition are:\n   *  $a = 1$ \n   *  $b = 1$\n5. **Minimizing a + b + c + d:** \n   *  $a + b + c + d = 1 + 1 + \\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{2} + \\frac{9\\sqrt{2}}{2} = 2 + 6\\sqrt{2}$\n**Conclusion**\nThe smallest possible value of $a + b + c + d$ is $\\boxed{2 + 6\\sqrt{2}}$. \n",
        "Here's a step-by-step solution:\n**1. Visualizing the Parallelograms**\n* **Parallelogram 1:** The lines  y = ax + c and y = ax + d are parallel, and the lines y = bx + c and y = bx + d are parallel.  This parallelogram has a height of d - c and a base of (d - c)/(b - a).  (Think about the difference in x-values when y = d and y = c for each line).\n* **Parallelogram 2:** The lines  y = ax + c and y = ax - d are parallel, and the lines y = bx + c and y = bx - d are parallel.  This parallelogram has a height of 2d and a base of 2d/(b - a). \n**2. Using the Area Information**\n* **Area of Parallelogram 1:**  (d - c) * (d - c) / (b - a) = 18\n* **Area of Parallelogram 2:**  2d * 2d / (b - a) = 72\n**3. Simplifying the Equations**\n* (d - c)\u00b2 / (b - a) = 18\n* 4d\u00b2 / (b - a) = 72  => d\u00b2 / (b - a) = 18\n**4. Finding a Relationship between d and (d - c)**\nNotice that both equations have d\u00b2 / (b - a) = 18.  This means (d - c)\u00b2 = d\u00b2.  Expanding this, we get:\nd\u00b2 - 2cd + c\u00b2 = d\u00b2 \n-2cd + c\u00b2 = 0\nc\u00b2 = 2cd\nSince c and d are positive integers, this implies c = 2d.\n**5. Minimizing a + b + c + d**\nSubstitute c = 2d into the equation (d - c)\u00b2 / (b - a) = 18:\n(d - 2d)\u00b2 / (b - a) = 18\nd\u00b2 / (b - a) = 18\nNow we want to minimize a + b + c + d, which is the same as minimizing a + b + 3d. \nTo do this, we'll try to find the smallest possible values for a, b, and d.\n* Since d\u00b2 / (b - a) = 18, we can see that d must be a multiple of 3 to make the expression a perfect square.\n* Let's try d = 3.  This gives us 9 / (b - a) = 18, so b - a = 1/2. This isn't possible with integers.\n* Let's try d = 6.  This gives us 36 / (b - a) = 18, so b - a = 2.  We could have a = 1 and b = 3.\n**6. Finding the Smallest Possible Values**\nWith d = 6 and b - a = 2, we can minimize a + b + 3d by setting a = 1 and b = 3. This gives us:\n* a = 1\n* b = 3\n* c = 2d = 12\n* d = 6\n**7. The Answer**\nThe smallest possible value of a + b + c + d is 1 + 3 + 12 + 6 = **22**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Parallelograms**\n* **First Parallelogram:**  Imagine the lines  $y = ax + c$ and $y = ax + d$. These lines are parallel since they have the same slope 'a'. The lines  $y = bx + c$ and $y = bx + d$ are also parallel with slope 'b'.  This forms a parallelogram where the vertical sides have length 'd - c'.\n* **Second Parallelogram:** The second parallelogram is similar, but the lines with slope 'a' and 'b' are shifted down by '2d' units. The vertical sides now have length '2d'. \n**2. Area Formula**\nThe area of a parallelogram is base times height. In both parallelograms:\n* **Base:** The distance between the lines with slope 'a' and 'b'. This distance is the same for both parallelograms.\n* **Height:** The vertical distance between the parallel lines, which is 'd - c' for the first parallelogram and '2d' for the second.\n**3. Setting Up Equations**\nWe are given:\n* Area of the first parallelogram = 18:  Base * (d - c) = 18\n* Area of the second parallelogram = 72: Base * (2d) = 72\n**4. Solving the Equations**\n* Divide the second equation by the first equation: (Base * 2d) / (Base * (d - c)) = 72 / 18\n* This simplifies to 2d / (d - c) = 4\n* Cross-multiplying gives: 2d = 4d - 4c\n* Solving for 'c': c = d/2\n**5. Finding the Minimum Value**\nSince 'c' and 'd' are positive integers, the smallest possible value of 'c' is 1 (when d = 2).  \nNow we need to find the minimum values of 'a' and 'b'.  Substitute 'c = 1' and 'd = 2' into the area equation for the first parallelogram:\n* Base * (2 - 1) = 18\n* Base = 18\nSince the base is the distance between the lines with slopes 'a' and 'b', the smallest possible values for 'a' and 'b' are 1 and 2 (or vice-versa).  \n**6. Conclusion**\nTherefore, the smallest possible values are:\n* a = 1\n* b = 2\n* c = 1\n* d = 2\nThe smallest possible value of a + b + c + d is 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = **6**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**Understanding the Problem**\nWe're given two parallelograms. Both share the same base (the distance between the lines $y=ax+c$ and $y=bx+c$) and the same height (the distance between the lines $y=ax+c$ and $y=ax+d$). The only difference is the vertical displacement of the second set of parallel lines.\n**Finding the Base and Height**\n* **Base:**  The base of both parallelograms is the distance between the lines $y=ax+c$ and $y=bx+c$. To find this distance, we can find the difference in the y-intercepts:  $c - c = 0$.  However, this doesn't make sense for a parallelogram. The lines are actually coincident.  Therefore, the base is actually the distance between the lines $y=ax+c$ and $y=bx+c$ at some other x-value. Let's consider when $x = 1$: \n    * The y-coordinate on the line $y=ax+c$ is $a+c$.\n    * The y-coordinate on the line $y=bx+c$ is $b+c$.\n    * The base length is the absolute value of the difference:  $|a+c - (b+c)| = |a-b|$. \n* **Height:** The height of both parallelograms is the distance between the lines $y=ax+c$ and $y=ax+d$.  Similar to the base, we can find this difference when $x = 1$:\n    * The y-coordinate on the line $y=ax+c$ is $a+c$.\n    * The y-coordinate on the line $y=ax+d$ is $a+d$.\n    * The height is the absolute value of the difference:  $|a+c - (a+d)| = |c-d|$. \n**Relating Area to Base and Height**\nThe area of a parallelogram is given by:  Area = base \u00d7 height.\n* For the first parallelogram (area 18):  18 = |a-b| \u00d7 |c-d|\n* For the second parallelogram (area 72):  72 = |a-b| \u00d7 |c-d|\n**Solving the Equations**\nNotice that the base and height are the same for both parallelograms.  Since 72 is four times greater than 18, this means the vertical distance between the lines $y=ax+c$ and $y=ax-d$ must be twice the vertical distance between the lines $y=ax+c$ and $y=ax+d$.  \nThis tells us:  $|c - (-d)| = 2|c-d|$, which simplifies to  $|c+d| = 2|c-d|$.\nSince $c$ and $d$ are positive integers, the only way this equation can hold is if $c = d$. \nNow, we can go back to the area equation for the first parallelogram:\n18 = |a-b| \u00d7 |c-d| \n18 = |a-b| \u00d7 |c-c|\n18 = 0\nThis is a contradiction!  We can't have an area of 0.  This means there is no solution to the problem as stated.\n**Conclusion**\nThere is no possible set of positive integer values for *a*, *b*, *c*, and *d* that satisfies the given conditions.  The problem is likely flawed. \n"
