        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n* **Understanding Pyramids:** A pyramid is a polyhedron with a base that is a polygon and triangular faces that meet at a point called the apex. \n* **Edges and Vertices:**  \n    * Edges are the line segments where the faces meet.\n    * Vertices are the points where the edges meet.\n* **Key Relationship:**  In any pyramid, the number of edges is always one more than twice the number of vertices.\n**Let's Apply This:**\n* We know the pyramid has 14 edges.\n* Let 'v' represent the number of vertices.\n* Using the relationship: 14 = 2v + 1\n* Solving for 'v':\n    * 13 = 2v\n    * v = 6.5\n**Since we can't have half a vertex, there must be an error in our understanding of the pyramid.  Pyramids cannot have an odd number of edges.**\n**Possible Scenarios:**\n* **Misunderstanding the Problem:** Maybe the problem intended to say the pyramid has a different number of edges.\n* **Non-Standard Pyramid:**  The problem might be referring to a pyramid with a different shape than the typical ones we usually see.  \n**Conclusion:**  There's no standard pyramid that can have 14 edges. \n",

Therefore, the pyramid has 13 + 1 = **14 vertices**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this:\n* **Understanding the Basics:**  A pyramid has a base that is a polygon (a shape with straight sides). The base is connected to a single point called the apex. \n* **Edges:** The edges of a pyramid are the line segments where the faces meet.\n* **Vertices:** The vertices of a pyramid are the points where the edges meet.\n**Thinking Step-by-Step:**\n1. **Base:** The base of a pyramid has a certain number of edges.  \n2. **Sides:** Each side of the base connects to the apex, forming an edge of the pyramid.\n3. **Apex:** The apex is connected to each vertex of the base, also forming edges.\n**Calculations:**\n* **Base Edges:**  Since we have 14 edges total, and we know some are for the sides of the pyramid, the base must have some edges. \n* **Side Edges:** The number of side edges is equal to the number of edges on the base.\n* **Apex Edges:** The apex connects to each vertex of the base, forming one edge for each vertex of the base.\n**Solving for Vertices:**\n* Let's say the base has 'n' edges. This means it also has 'n' vertices.\n* The total number of edges is: n (base edges) + n (side edges) + n (apex edges) = 14\n* Combining like terms: 3n = 14\n* Solving for n: n = 14/3. Since we can't have a fraction of an edge, this means our assumption about the base having 'n' edges is incorrect.\n**The Problem:**\nThe problem is that a pyramid cannot have 14 edges. Pyramids have an odd number of edges.  The number of edges in a pyramid is always one more than three times the number of sides of its base.\n**Conclusion:**\nThere is no pyramid with 14 edges. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this:\n* **Understanding Pyramids:** A pyramid has a base that is a polygon, and triangular faces that meet at a point called the apex. \n* **Edges and Vertices:**  Edges are the lines where the faces meet. Vertices are the points where the edges meet.\n* **Relationship:**  Every edge connects two vertices.\n**Let's apply this to the problem:**\n1. **Base:** A pyramid with 14 edges must have a base with 14/2 = 7 edges. This means the base is a heptagon (7 sides).\n2. **Vertices of the Base:**  A heptagon has 7 vertices.\n3. **Apex:** The apex of the pyramid adds one more vertex.\n4. **Total Vertices:**  Therefore, the pyramid has 7 + 1 = **8** vertices. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding the Relationship**\n* **Edges:** The lines where the faces of a shape meet.\n* **Vertices:** The points where the edges of a shape meet. \n**Pyramids**\n* A pyramid has a base that is a polygon (triangle, square, pentagon, etc.).\n* The base has the same number of vertices and edges.\n* The other faces of the pyramid are triangles that meet at a single point called the apex.\n**Solving the Problem**\n1. **Base Edges:**  Since the pyramid has 14 edges, and the base is a polygon with some number of edges, the apex must connect to the remaining edges (14 - [number of base edges]).\n2. **Base Vertices:** The base polygon has the same number of vertices as edges. \n3. **Apex:** The apex contributes one additional vertex.\n**Putting it Together**\nLet's say the base has 'n' edges (and therefore 'n' vertices).  Then:\n* **Total edges:** n + n = 14\n* **Total vertices:** n + 1 = 14/2 + 1 = 7 + 1 = 8\n**Therefore, a pyramid with 14 edges has 8 vertices.** \n"
