    "solution": "Name the vertices of the hexagon so that hexagon $ABCDEF$ has $AB=1$, $BC=7$, $CD=2$, and $DE=4$.  The hexagon is equiangular, so each interior angle measures $180(6-2)/6=120$ degrees.  Extend sides $AB$, $CD$, and $EF$ and call their intersection points $G$, $H$, and $J$ as shown.  The exterior angles of the hexagon each measure $180-120=60$ degrees, so triangles $JDE$, $CBH$, $FGA$, and $JHG$ are all equilateral.  It follows that $JD=DE=4$ units and $CH=CB=7$ units.  Therefore the side length $JH$ of triangle $JGH$ is $4+2+7=13$ units.  Turning to side $HG$, we find that $AF=AG=13-(7+1)=5$ units.  Finally, we solve $JG=JE+EF+FG$ for $EF$ to get $EF=13-(4+5)=4$ units.  The sum of the missing sides is $5+4=\\boxed{9}$ units.\n\n[asy]\nsize(6cm);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(.7pt)+fontsize(8pt));\ndotfactor=4;\n\npair A=(8,0), B=(7,0), C=7*dir(60), D=9*dir(60), Ep=(13,0)+9*dir(120), F=(13,0)+5*dir(120), G=(13,0), H=(0,0), J=13*dir(60);\n\npair[] dots = {A, B, C, D, Ep, F};\n\ndot(dots);\n\ndraw(A--B--C--D--Ep--F--cycle);\n\ndraw(B--H--C,dashed);\ndraw(D--J--Ep,dashed);\ndraw(F--G--A,dashed);\n\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,S);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,S);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,NW);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,NW);\nlabel(\"$E$\",Ep,NE);\nlabel(\"$F$\",F,NE);\nlabel(\"$G$\",G,SE);\nlabel(\"$H$\",H,SW);\nlabel(\"$J$\",J,N);\n\nlabel(\"$1$\",(A+B)/2,N);\nlabel(\"$7$\",(B+C)/2,NE);\nlabel(\"$2$\",(C+D)/2,SE);\nlabel(\"$4$\",(D+Ep)/2,S);\n[/asy]",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**Understanding Equiangular Hexagons**\n* **Equal Angles:** An equiangular hexagon has all six angles equal.\n* **Interior Angle Sum:** The sum of the interior angles of any hexagon is 720 degrees. Since all angles are equal, each angle in an equiangular hexagon measures 720/6 = 120 degrees.\n**Using the Properties**\n1. **Opposite Sides:**  In an equiangular hexagon, opposite sides are parallel and equal in length. \n2. **Missing Sides:**  We know the lengths of four consecutive sides: 1, 7, 2, and 4. Let's label the missing sides as *x* and *y*.\n   * Side *x* is opposite side 2, so *x* = 2.\n   * Side *y* is opposite side 7, so *y* = 7.\n**The Solution**\nThe sum of the lengths of the two remaining sides is *x* + *y* = 2 + 7 = **9**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding Equiangular Hexagons**\nAn equiangular hexagon has all six angles equal.  Since the sum of the angles in any hexagon is 720 degrees, each angle in an equiangular hexagon measures 120 degrees.\n**Key Property**\nA key property of equiangular hexagons is that opposite sides are parallel.  This is because the interior angles on the same side of a transversal line (formed by a pair of opposite sides) add up to 180 degrees (120 + 60 = 180).\n**Applying the Property**\n1. **Labeling:** Let the lengths of the remaining sides be  *x* and *y*. \n2. **Opposite Sides:** Since opposite sides are parallel and equal, we can match up the sides:\n    * Side 1 (length 1) is opposite side 4 (length 4).\n    * Side 2 (length 7) is opposite side *x*.\n    * Side 3 (length 2) is opposite side *y*.\n3. **Solving:**  Therefore,  *x* = 7 and *y* = 2.\n**The Answer**\nThe sum of the lengths of the two remaining sides is *x* + *y* = 7 + 2 = **9**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**Understanding Equiangular Hexagons**\n* **Equiangular:**  All angles are equal.\n* **Hexagon:**  A polygon with six sides.\n**Important Property**\nAn equiangular hexagon can be divided into six congruent equilateral triangles.  This means all sides of the hexagon are equal.\n**Solution**\n1. **Label the sides:**  Let the unknown side lengths be  'a' and 'b'. \n2. **Equal sides:** Since all sides of the hexagon are equal, we have:\n   * a = 1\n   * b = 7 \n   * 2 = 4  (This is a contradiction!)\n**Conclusion**\nThe given side lengths cannot form an equiangular hexagon.  There's an error in the problem statement. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step by step:\n**Understanding Equiangular Hexagons**\n* **Equal Angles:** An equiangular hexagon has all six interior angles equal.\n* **Parallel Sides:**  Since the angles are equal, opposite sides of an equiangular hexagon are parallel.\n**Visualizing the Problem**\nImagine the hexagon with sides labeled in order: 1, 7, 2, 4, and the two unknown sides. \n**Using Parallelism**\n* **Opposite Sides:**  The side opposite the side of length 1 is parallel to it.  Since the hexagon is equiangular, these two sides must have the same length, which is 1.\n* **Opposite Sides:** The side opposite the side of length 7 is parallel to it and also has length 7.\n**Finding the Missing Sides**\n* We have accounted for four sides: 1, 7, 2, and 4.\n* We know the remaining two sides must be parallel to each other, meaning they are equal in length. \n*  Let's call the length of each of these missing sides 'x'.\n* **Perimeter:** The perimeter of the hexagon is the sum of all its sides: 1 + 7 + 2 + 4 + x + x = 14 + 2x\n**The Trick**\n*  The perimeter of a hexagon can be found by adding the lengths of the three pairs of opposite sides.\n* Since we have opposite sides of lengths 1 and 7, and 2 and 4, the perimeter is also: (1+7) + (2+4) + (x+x) = 14 + 2x\n**Solving for x**\nWe now have two expressions for the perimeter that must be equal:\n14 + 2x = 14 + 2x\nThis means the value of 'x' doesn't actually affect the perimeter, which makes sense because the opposite sides of an equiangular hexagon are always equal.\n**Answer**\nThe sum of the lengths of the two remaining sides is 2x, but since 'x' is the length of one side, the answer is simply **2x** or **the length of one of the remaining sides doubled**. \n",

Finding the Missing Sides**\n* Let the missing side lengths be  *x* and *y*.  Since they are opposite sides of parallelograms:\n    * *x* is opposite the side of length 7, so *x* = 7.\n    * *y* is opposite the side of length 4, so *y* = 4.\n**5.
