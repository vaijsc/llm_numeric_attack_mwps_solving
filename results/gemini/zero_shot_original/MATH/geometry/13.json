        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Geometry**\n* We have a rectangle with width 8 inches.\n* Corner A is folded over to coincide with point C on the opposite side, creating a crease (the fold) represented by line segment l.\n* This creates a right triangle ABC, where:\n    * AB is the width of the rectangle (8 inches).\n    * BC is given as 5 inches.\n    * AC is the length of the fold (l).\n**2. Use the Pythagorean Theorem**\nSince triangle ABC is a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem:\n* a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2 \nWhere:\n* a = BC = 5 inches\n* b = AC = l \n* c = AB = 8 inches\n**3. Substitute and Solve**\nSubstitute the values into the Pythagorean Theorem:\n* 5\u00b2 + l\u00b2 = 8\u00b2\nSimplify and solve for l:\n* 25 + l\u00b2 = 64\n* l\u00b2 = 39\n* l = \u221a39 \n**4. Answer**\nThe length of the fold (l) is **\u221a39 inches**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Understand the Geometry:**\n* The folded paper forms a right triangle with vertices at B, C, and the point where the fold intersects the bottom edge (let's call this point D). \n* We know BC = 5 inches.\n* The length of the paper AD is 8 inches, and since AC is the fold,  AD = DC. Therefore, DC = 8 inches.\n**2. Use the Pythagorean Theorem:**\n* Triangle BCD is a right triangle with right angle at D. \n* We can use the Pythagorean theorem:  BD\u00b2 + DC\u00b2 = BC\u00b2\n**3. Solve for BD:**\n* Substitute the known values: BD\u00b2 + 8\u00b2 = 5\u00b2\n* Simplify: BD\u00b2 + 64 = 25\n* Solve for BD\u00b2: BD\u00b2 = -39\n* Since a length cannot be negative, we realize there's an error in our assumptions. The problem is not solvable as stated.\n**Conclusion:**\nThe given dimensions (BC = 5 inches and width = 8 inches) are not possible.  It's impossible to fold a rectangle in the way described with these measurements.  \nLet's consider why this might be the case:\n* **The diagonal AC:**  The diagonal of the rectangle must be longer than the width. If BC = 5 inches, AC (the fold) would need to be longer than 8 inches for the fold to reach the opposite side. \n**To make this problem solvable:**\n* You would need to adjust either the width of the paper or the length of BC. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Geometry**\n* We have a rectangle with a corner folded over.\n* The fold creates a right triangle where the hypotenuse is the fold length 'l', one leg is the width of the rectangle (8 inches), and the other leg is the difference between the width and the segment BC (8 - 5 = 3 inches).\n**2. Apply the Pythagorean Theorem**\nThe Pythagorean Theorem states:  a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2  where 'a' and 'b' are the legs of a right triangle, and 'c' is the hypotenuse.\n* In our problem:\n    * a = 3 inches\n    * b = 8 inches\n    * c = l (the fold length)\n**3. Solve for 'l'**\n* Substitute the values into the Pythagorean Theorem: 3\u00b2 + 8\u00b2 = l\u00b2\n* Simplify: 9 + 64 = l\u00b2\n* Combine: 73 = l\u00b2\n* Take the square root of both sides: l = \u221a73\n**4. The Answer**\nThe length of the fold 'l' is **\u221a73 inches**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n1. **Labeling:**\n   - Let $D$ be the point where the fold intersects the bottom edge of the paper. \n   - We know $BC = 5$ inches and $AD = 8$ inches (the width of the paper).\n2. **Similar Triangles:**\n   - Notice that triangles $ABC$ and $ACD$ are similar.  This is because they share angle $C$, and angles $CAB$ and $CDA$ are both right angles (due to the fold).\n3. **Proportions:**\n   - Since the triangles are similar, their corresponding sides are proportional.  This means: \n      - $\\frac{BC}{AC} = \\frac{CD}{AD}$\n4. **Solving for AC:**\n   - We know $BC = 5$ inches and $AD = 8$ inches.  We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find $AC$:\n      - $AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2 = (8-3)^2 + 5^2 = 50$\n      - Therefore, $AC = \\sqrt{50} = 5\\sqrt{2}$ inches.\n5. **Solving for CD:**\n   - Now we can substitute the values we know into the proportion:\n      - $\\frac{5}{5\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{CD}{8}$\n      - Solving for $CD$, we get: $CD = \\frac{40}{5\\sqrt{2}} = 4\\sqrt{2}$ inches.\n6. **Finding the Fold Length (l):**\n   -  Finally, the fold length $l$ is the hypotenuse of right triangle $ACD$.  Using the Pythagorean Theorem again:\n      - $l^2 = CD^2 + AD^2 = (4\\sqrt{2})^2 + 8^2 = 96$\n      - Therefore, $l = \\sqrt{96} = \\boxed{4\\sqrt{6}}$ inches. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n1. **Visualize the Fold:** Imagine folding the paper along line segment $l$. The folded portion will form a right triangle with hypotenuse $l$. \n2. **Identify the Sides:**  \n    * The base of the triangle is the distance from point $C$ to the edge of the paper, which is 8 inches - 5 inches = 3 inches.\n    * The height of the triangle is the distance from point $C$ to the bottom edge of the paper, which is 6 inches.\n3. **Use the Pythagorean Theorem:** Since we have a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse (the fold, $l$):\n   *  $l^2 = 3^2 + 6^2$\n   *  $l^2 = 9 + 36$\n   *  $l^2 = 45$\n   *  $l = \\sqrt{45} = 3\\sqrt{5}$ inches\n**Therefore, the length of the fold, $l$, is  $3\\sqrt{5}$ inches.** \n"
