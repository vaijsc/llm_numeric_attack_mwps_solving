    "solution": "In square $ABCD$, diagonal $\\overline{AC}$ divides the square into 2 equal areas.  Thus, the area of $\\triangle ACD$ is one-half of the area of square $ABCD$, and therefore is $\\frac14$ of the total area of the two squares.\n\nSince $\\overline{AC}$ is the diagonal of square $ABCD$, we have $\\angle ACB=45^{\\circ}$, so $\\angle HCJ = 45^\\circ$, which means $\\triangle CHJ$ is an isosceles right triangle.  Since $HJ = \\frac{HG}{2}$, the area of $\\triangle CHJ$ is $\\frac12(CH)(HJ) = \\frac12\\cdot \\frac{HG}{2} \\cdot \\frac{HG}{2} = \\frac18HG^2$, which means that the area of $\\triangle CHJ$ is $\\frac18$ of the area of one of the squares, or $\\frac{1}{16}$ of the total area of the two squares.

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Understanding the Diagram**\n* We have two congruent squares, ABCD and EFGH. \n*  They share a common side BC, and their vertices are aligned along that line.\n*  Diagonal AC of square ABCD is extended to point J, which is the midpoint of side GH.\n**2.  Key Observations**\n* **Area of triangles:**  Notice that triangle ACJ has the same base (AC) and height (the distance between line AC and point J) as triangle CDH.  Since they share the same base and height, they have the same area.\n* **Area of triangles and squares:**  The area of square ABCD is equal to the sum of the areas of triangles ABC and ACD.  Similarly, the area of square EFGH is equal to the sum of the areas of triangles EFG and FGH.\n**3.  Relating the Areas**\n* Since the squares have equal area, we can write:\n   * Area of triangle ABC + Area of triangle ACD = Area of triangle EFG + Area of triangle FGH\n* We know triangle ACJ has the same area as triangle CDH. Substituting:\n   * Area of triangle ABC + Area of triangle ACJ = Area of triangle EFG + Area of triangle FGH\n**4.  Finding the Shaded Area**\n* Notice that the shaded area consists of triangle ABC plus triangle ACJ. \n* Since triangle ACJ has the same area as triangle CDH, the shaded area is equivalent to the area of triangle ABC + triangle CDH.\n* This is also equivalent to the area of square ABCD.\n**5.  The Fraction**\n* The shaded area represents the area of one of the squares, and there are two squares.\n* Therefore, the shaded area represents **1/2** of the total area of the two squares.\n**Answer:** The fraction of the two squares that is shaded is **1/2**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Geometry**\n* We have two squares with equal areas, meaning their sides are also equal.\n*  Line segment BH passes through the centers of both squares.  This means the distance from B to the center of square ABCD is the same as the distance from H to the center of square EFGH. \n* Since J is the midpoint of GH, triangle GJH is a 30-60-90 triangle.\n**2. Use Proportions**\n* **Triangle GJH:**  Since J is the midpoint of GH, GJ = JH.  Because it's a 30-60-90 triangle, GJ = JH = (1/2)GH.  Also, GH is equal to the side length of square EFGH, so GJ = JH = (1/2) side length of EFGH.\n* **Triangle BCJ:**  Triangle BCJ is similar to triangle GJH (they share angle J and have parallel sides).  Since the ratio of corresponding sides in similar triangles is equal,  BC/GJ = (side length of ABCD)/GJ = (side length of EFGH)/GJ = 2.  Therefore, BC = 2GJ.\n**3.  Calculate the Shaded Area**\n* **Area of triangle BCJ:**  Area = (1/2) * base * height.  We know BC = 2GJ and the height is the side length of square ABCD.  Therefore, the area of triangle BCJ is (1/2) * 2GJ * (side length of ABCD) = GJ * (side length of ABCD).\n* **Shaded area:** The shaded area is the area of square ABCD minus the area of triangle BCJ.  This is (side length of ABCD)\u00b2 - GJ * (side length of ABCD).\n**4. Express the Shaded Area as a Fraction**\n* **Factor out the side length:** (side length of ABCD)\u00b2 - GJ * (side length of ABCD) = (side length of ABCD) * (side length of ABCD - GJ).\n* **Substitute GJ:** Since GJ = (1/2) side length of EFGH and the side lengths of the squares are equal,  GJ = (1/2) side length of ABCD.\n* **Simplify:** The shaded area is (side length of ABCD) * (side length of ABCD - (1/2) side length of ABCD) = (1/2) * (side length of ABCD)\u00b2.\n* **Fraction of the whole:** The shaded area is (1/2) * (side length of ABCD)\u00b2 and the total area of the two squares is 2 * (side length of ABCD)\u00b2.  The fraction of the shaded area is [(1/2) * (side length of ABCD)\u00b2] / [2 * (side length of ABCD)\u00b2] = **1/4**. \n**Answer:** The fraction of the two squares that is shaded is **1/4**. \n",
        "Here's a step-by-step solution:\n**1.  Understanding the Diagram**\n* We have two squares, ABCD and EFGH, with equal area.\n*  Points B, E, C, and H lie on a straight line.\n*  Diagonal AC is extended to point J, which is the midpoint of GH.\n**2.  Key Observations**\n* **Congruent Triangles:** Triangle BJE and CHJ are congruent because:\n    *  BE = CH (sides of equal squares)\n    *  \u2220BJE = \u2220CHJ (vertical angles)\n    *  \u2220JEB = \u2220JHC (alternate interior angles, since BC || EH) \n* **Equal Areas:** Since the triangles are congruent, they have equal areas.\n**3. Finding the Shaded Area**\n* **Area of Square ABCD:** Let the side length of the squares be 's'.  The area of square ABCD is s\u00b2.\n* **Area of Triangle BJE:** The area of a triangle is (1/2) * base * height. Since triangle BJE is congruent to triangle CHJ, their combined area is equal to the area of rectangle BCEH.  The base of BCEH is 's', and the height is 's/2' (since J is the midpoint of GH).  Therefore, the area of triangle BJE is (1/2) * s * (s/2) = s\u00b2/4.\n* **Shaded Area:** The shaded area is the area of square ABCD minus the area of triangle BJE.  This is s\u00b2 - s\u00b2/4 = 3s\u00b2/4.\n**4. Fraction of the Squares Shaded**\nThe fraction of the two squares shaded is the shaded area divided by the total area of the two squares:\n(3s\u00b2/4) / (2s\u00b2) = **3/8**\n**Therefore, 3/8 of the two squares is shaded.** \n",
        "Here's a step-by-step solution:\n**1.  Understanding the Problem:**\n* We have two squares with equal areas.\n*  A line segment connects vertices of the squares in a specific way.\n*  A diagonal of one square is extended to the midpoint of a side of the other square.\n* We need to find the fraction of the total area of the squares that is shaded.\n**2. Key Observations:**\n* **Congruent Triangles:**  Triangle $ABC$ is congruent to triangle $HEJ$ (by SAS congruence).  \n    *  $AB = HE$ (sides of equal squares)\n    *  $BC = EJ$ (half the side of a square)\n    *  $\\angle ABC = \\angle HEJ$ (both are right angles)\n* **Area Relationships:**  Since triangles $ABC$ and $HEJ$ are congruent, they have the same area. Also, the shaded area is made up of these two congruent triangles.\n**3. Finding the Shaded Area:**\n* **Area of one square:** Let the side length of each square be *s*.  The area of one square is *s\u00b2*.\n* **Area of shaded region:** The shaded region consists of two congruent triangles, each with an area of (1/2) * base * height. Since the base of each triangle is *s* and the height is *s*, the area of each triangle is (1/2) * *s* * *s* = (1/2) * *s\u00b2*. \n* **Total shaded area:** The total shaded area is 2 * (1/2) * *s\u00b2* = *s\u00b2*.\n**4. The Fraction:**\n* **Fraction of shaded area:** The shaded area (*s\u00b2*) is equal to the area of one square. Since there are two squares, the fraction of the total area that is shaded is  *s\u00b2* / (2 * *s\u00b2*) = **1/2**.\n**Answer:**  The fraction of the two squares that is shaded is **1/2**. \n",

Key Observations**\n* **Similar Triangles:**  Triangle ABC is similar to triangle HJG.  This is because the corresponding angles are equal (due to parallel lines).\n* **Side Ratios:** Since J is the midpoint of GH, the ratio of the sides of triangle ABC to triangle HJG is 1:2. \n**3. Area Relationship**\n* **Similar Triangles:**  The ratio of the areas of similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Therefore, the area of triangle ABC is 1/4 the area of triangle HJG.\n**4. Shaded Area**\n* **Area of Square:** The area of square ABCD is equal to the area of triangle ABC plus the area of triangle BCD.\n* **Area of Shaded Region:** The shaded area is the area of square ABCD minus the area of triangle BCD, which is equal to the area of triangle ABC.\n* **Fraction of Shaded Area:** Since the area of triangle ABC is 1/4 the area of triangle HJG, and triangle HJG is half the area of square EFGH, the area of triangle ABC is 1/8 the area of square EFGH.
