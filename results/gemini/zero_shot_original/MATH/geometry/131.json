        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the volume of the first cylinder:**\n* The formula for the volume of a cylinder is  *V = \u03c0r\u00b2h* \n*  Where *r* is the radius and *h* is the height.\n*  Substitute the values for the first cylinder:  *V = \u03c0(6\u00b2)(12) = 432\u03c0* cubic inches.\n**2. Set up an equation to find the height of the second cylinder:**\n*  Since the volumes are equal, we can set up the following equation:  *\u03c0(8\u00b2)*h = 432\u03c0\n*  Simplify the equation: 64\u03c0h = 432\u03c0\n**3. Solve for the height (h) of the second cylinder:**\n*  Divide both sides of the equation by 64\u03c0: h = 432\u03c0 / 64\u03c0 \n*  Simplify: h = 6.75 inches\n**4. Express the answer as a mixed number:**\n*  6.75 inches is equivalent to 6 \u00be inches.\n**Therefore, the height of the second cylinder is 6 \u00be inches.** \n",

Find the volume of the first cylinder:**\n* The formula for the volume of a cylinder is  \u03c0r\u00b2h, where r is the radius and h is the height.\n* Volume of the first cylinder = \u03c0(6\u00b2)(12) = 432\u03c0 cubic inches\n**2. Set up an equation to find the height of the second cylinder:**\n* We know the second cylinder has the same volume (432\u03c0 cubic inches) and a radius of 8 inches. Let 'h' be the height of the second cylinder.\n*  \u03c0(8\u00b2)(h) = 432\u03c0\n**3. Solve for 'h':**\n* 64\u03c0h = 432\u03c0\n* h = 432\u03c0 / 64\u03c0\n* h = 6.75 inches\n**4.
