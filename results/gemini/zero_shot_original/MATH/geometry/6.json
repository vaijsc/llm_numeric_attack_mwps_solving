        "Here's a step-by-step solution to find the value of $a + b + c$:\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\nThe problem involves changing the radius of one circle while maintaining tangency conditions. This will alter the triangle's shape. Our goal is to find the new radius of the circle centered at $R$ and express it in the form $\\frac{a + \\sqrt{b}}{c}$.\n**2.  Key Observations**\n* **Symmetry:**  The original configuration is symmetrical about the vertical line passing through $P$ and $R$. This symmetry will be preserved even after changing the radius of the circle centered at $R$.\n* **Tangency:**  The tangency points between the circles form a regular hexagon (all sides and angles equal). This is important because the side length of this hexagon is equal to the diameter of the circles.\n**3.

Using Geometry**\n* **Hexagon:**  Triangle $XYZ$ is an equilateral triangle with side length $2r$ (diameter of the circle with center $R$).\n* **Right Triangles:**  Triangles $PQR$ and $PQS$ are right triangles.\n* **Pythagoras:**  Apply the Pythagorean theorem to triangle $PQR$ (or $PQS$): \n   *  $PR^2 = PQ^2 + QR^2$\n   *  $(1 + r)^2 = 2^2 + (1 - r)^2$\n**5. Solving for r**\n* Expand the equation: $1 + 2r + r^2 = 4 + 1 - 2r + r^2$\n* Simplify: $4r = 4$\n* Solve: $r = 1$\n**6.  Final Answer**\nThe new radius of the circle with center $R$ is $r = 1$.

        "Let's analyze the situation step by step.\n**1. Understanding the Geometry**\n* **Original Setup:**  The original diagram shows four circles of radius 1 tangent to each other and the sides of triangle ABC.  This arrangement forms a symmetrical pattern.\n* **Change:** We decrease the radius of the circle centered at R to 'r'. This change affects the triangle's shape.\n* **Key Observation:** The circle centered at P becomes tangent to the other three circles after the change. This means that the points of tangency between the circles at P, Q, and S form an equilateral triangle.\n**2. Applying Key Geometric Principles**\n* **Equilateral Triangle:**  Since PQ, PS, and QS are tangent to the circles, they are also tangent to the circles at their points of tangency.  This creates an equilateral triangle with sides of length 2 (the sum of the radii of the circles at P, Q, and S).\n* **Pythagorean Theorem:** In triangle PQS, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the height of the triangle. The height is equal to  \u221a3.\n* **Tangents from a Point:** The lengths of the tangents from a point to a circle are equal. This means PR = PS, and QR = QS.\n**3. Setting Up Equations**\n* **PR = PS:**  PR = 1 + r (sum of the radii) \n* **QR = QS:** QR = 1 + r (sum of the radii) \n* **PQ:**  PQ = 2 (side of equilateral triangle)\n**4. Solving for r**\nLet's consider triangle PQR.  Using the Law of Cosines on triangle PQR:\n* PQ\u00b2 = PR\u00b2 + QR\u00b2 - 2(PR)(QR) cos(\u2220PQR)\nSubstitute the values we know:\n* 2\u00b2 = (1 + r)\u00b2 + (1 + r)\u00b2 - 2(1 + r)(1 + r) cos(\u2220PQR)\nSimplify:\n* 4 = 2(1 + r)\u00b2 - 2(1 + r)\u00b2 cos(\u2220PQR)\n* 2 = (1 + r)\u00b2 (1 - cos(\u2220PQR))\nSince the height of equilateral triangle PQS is \u221a3, we can find cos(\u2220PQR) using the height and base of triangle PQR:\n* cos(\u2220PQR) = (1 + r) / 2(1 + r) = 1/2\nSubstitute back into the equation:\n* 2 = (1 + r)\u00b2 (1 - 1/2)\n* 4 = (1 + r)\u00b2\n* 2 = 1 + r\n* r = 1\n**5. Conclusion**\nTherefore, the new radius of the circle centered at R is r = 1. Since r is already in the form of $\\frac{a+\\sqrt{b}}{c}$, we have a = 1, b = 0, and c = 1.\nFinally, a + b + c = 1 + 0 + 1 = **2**. \n",
        "Let's analyze the situation step-by-step:\n**1.  Understanding the Original Setup**\n* The original configuration shows four circles of radius 1 tangent to each other and to the sides of triangle ABC.  This creates a symmetrical arrangement where the centers of the circles form a square. \n* Since PQRS forms a square with side length 2,  the distance between the centers of any two adjacent circles is 2. \n**2.  The Change**\n* The circle centered at R shrinks, but it remains tangent to BC and to the other three circles.  \n* The circle centered at P now becomes tangent to the other three circles. This implies that P must now be the center of a circle inscribed in a triangle formed by the centers of the other three circles (Q, R, and S).\n**3.  Analyzing the New Triangle**\n* The triangle formed by Q, R, and S is an isosceles triangle with base QR of length 2 and two sides of length 2 (the distances between the centers of the circles).\n* Since P is now the incenter of this triangle,  PR = PS = PQ (the incenter is equidistant from all sides of the triangle).\n**4.  Using Geometry**\n*  Let the new radius of the circle centered at R be *r*. \n* Since PR = PS = 2, and PR = 1 + *r* (the sum of the radii of the two circles), we have *r* = 1. \n*  Now, draw a perpendicular from P to QR, meeting QR at X. PX is the inradius of triangle QRS. \n* Triangle QXP is a right triangle with right angle at X.  QX = 1 (half of QR), and PX = *r* = 1. \n*  By the Pythagorean Theorem, PQ\u00b2 = QX\u00b2 + PX\u00b2 = 1\u00b2 + 1\u00b2 = 2.  Therefore, PQ = \u221a2.\n**5.  Finding the New Side Lengths of the Triangle**\n* Let the length of each of the equal sides of triangle QRS be *s*.\n* Since PQ = \u221a2 and PQ = *s* - 1 (the difference between the side length of the triangle and the radius of the circle centered at Q),  we have *s* = \u221a2 + 1.\n**6.  Final Calculation**\n* The new side lengths of triangle ABC are:\n    * BC = 2*s = 2(\u221a2 + 1)\n    * AB = AC = 2*s + 2 = 2(\u221a2 + 2)\n*  Therefore, the perimeter of triangle ABC is 6 + 4\u221a2.\n**7.  Answer**\nThe new radius *r* is 1, which is of the form (a + \u221ab) / c, where a = 1, b = 0, and c = 1. Therefore, a + b + c = 1 + 0 + 1 = **2**. \n",

        "Here's a step-by-step solution to find the value of  $a+b+c$:\n**1. Understanding the Geometry**\n* **Original Setup:** In the original diagram, we have four circles of radius 1 tangent to each other and the sides of the triangle.  Notice that the centers of these circles form a square with side length 2.\n* **Change:**  When the radius of the circle centered at $R$ is decreased to $r$, the circle centered at $P$ will move closer to the line $BC$. This will create a new square (with $P$ as one of the vertices)  whose side length is equal to the diameter of the circle centered at $P$ (which is still 2).\n**2. Finding the New Position of P**\n* **Key Observation:**  Since the circle centered at $R$ remains tangent to the line $BC$, the distance from the center of the circle at $R$ to the line $BC$ remains $r$.\n* **Geometry:** Draw a perpendicular from the center of the circle at $R$ to the line $BC$. Let this intersection point be $X$. Now, draw a perpendicular from $P$ to $BC$, and let the intersection point be $Y$.\n* **Right Triangles:**  We have two right triangles: $\\triangle RXB$ and $\\triangle PYB$. Since $R$ and $P$ are tangent to $BC$, we have $XB = r$ and $YB = 1$.\n* **Pythagorean Theorem:** Applying the Pythagorean Theorem to both right triangles:\n    *  $RX^2 + r^2 = 1^2$ (from $\\triangle RXB$)\n    *  $PY^2 + 1^2 = 2^2$ (from $\\triangle PYB$)\n* **Solving for RY:**  Notice that $RY = RX - PY$.  We can solve for $RX$ and $PY$ from the equations above:\n    * $RX = \\sqrt{1-r^2}$\n    * $PY = \\sqrt{3}$\n    * $RY = \\sqrt{1-r^2} - \\sqrt{3}$\n**3. Setting up the Equation**\n* **Distance from R to P:** The distance between the centers of the circles at $R$ and $P$ is now $1 + r + \\sqrt{1 - r^2} - \\sqrt{3}$ (the radius of circle $R$, the radius of circle $P$, and the distance $RY$).\n* **Equating:** This distance is also equal to the side length of the new square, which is 2. So we have:\n    $1 + r + \\sqrt{1 - r^2} - \\sqrt{3} = 2$\n**4. Solving for r**\n* **Simplifying:**\n    * $\\sqrt{1 - r^2} = 1 - r + \\sqrt{3}$\n    * Square both sides: $1 - r^2 = (1 - r + \\sqrt{3})^2$\n* **Expanding and Solving:**\n    * $1 - r^2 = 1 - 2r + r^2 + 2\\sqrt{3} - 2\\sqrt{3}r + 3$\n    * $2r^2 - 2r + 2\\sqrt{3}r + 3 - 1 = 0$\n    * $2r^2 + (2\\sqrt{3} - 2)r + 2 = 0$\n* **Quadratic Formula:**  Using the quadratic formula to solve for $r$:\n    * $r = \\frac{-(2\\sqrt{3} - 2) \\pm \\sqrt{(2\\sqrt{3} - 2)^2 - 4(2)(2)}}{2(2)}$\n    * Simplify: $r = \\frac{1 - \\sqrt{3} \\pm \\sqrt{10 - 4\\sqrt{3}}}{2}$\n**5.

This gives us: \n    * $r = \\frac{1 - \\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{10 - 4\\sqrt{3}}}{2}$\n* **Form:** The value of $r$ is now in the form $\\frac{a + \\sqrt{b}}{c}$ where $a = 1$, $b = 10 - 4\\sqrt{3}$, and $c = 2$.\n* **Sum:** Therefore, $a + b + c = 1 + 10 - 4\\sqrt{3} + 2 = \\boxed{13 - 4\\sqrt{3}}$. \n"
