        "1. **Find the points of intersection:**\n   * We already know the lines intersect at (4, 0).\n   * To find where the line  *y = -2x + 8* intersects the line *x = -2*, substitute *x = -2* into the equation: \n      * y = -2(-2) + 8 = 12.  So the intersection point is (-2, 12).\n   * Similarly, substitute *x = -2* into the equation *y = (1/2)x - 2*:\n      * y = (1/2)(-2) - 2 = -3.  So the intersection point is (-2, -3).\n2. **Visualize the triangle:**\n   * The triangle is formed by the points (4, 0), (-2, 12), and (-2, -3).\n3. **Calculate the base and height:**\n   * The base of the triangle lies along the line *x = -2* and has a length of 12 - (-3) = 15 units.\n   * The height of the triangle is the distance from the point (4, 0) to the line *x = -2*, which is 4 - (-2) = 6 units.\n4. **Calculate the area:**\n   * The area of a triangle is (1/2) * base * height.\n   * Area = (1/2) * 15 * 6 = **45 square units**. \n",
