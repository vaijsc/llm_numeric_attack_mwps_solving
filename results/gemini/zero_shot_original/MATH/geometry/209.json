        "Here's how to solve this problem step by step:\n**1. Visualize the Setup**\nImagine three spheres of radius 1 sitting on a flat plane, touching each other.  The centers of these spheres form an equilateral triangle.  The fourth sphere, with radius 2, rests on top of these three, touching each.\n**2.  Find the Height of the Equilateral Triangle**\n* **Center to Vertex:** Draw a line from the center of the equilateral triangle to one of its vertices. This line bisects the equilateral triangle into two 30-60-90 right triangles.\n* **Hypotenuse:** The hypotenuse of each right triangle is the radius of one of the smaller spheres (1).\n* **Short Leg:** The short leg of each right triangle is half the length of a side of the equilateral triangle.\n* **Long Leg:** The long leg is the height of the equilateral triangle.\nUsing the 30-60-90 triangle ratios:\n* Short leg = (hypotenuse)/2 = 1/2\n* Long leg = (short leg) * \u221a3 = (1/2) * \u221a3 = \u221a3/2\n**3. Find the Distance from the Plane to the Center of the Large Sphere**\n* **Radius of Small Sphere:** The distance from the plane to the center of one of the smaller spheres is its radius, 1.\n* **Height of Triangle:** We found the height of the equilateral triangle is \u221a3/2.\n* **Distance to Center:** Add the radius of a small sphere to the height of the triangle: 1 + \u221a3/2\n**4. Find the Total Distance**\n* **Radius of Large Sphere:** The distance from the center of the large sphere to its top is its radius, 2.\n* **Total Distance:**  Add the distance from the plane to the center of the large sphere to the radius of the large sphere: (1 + \u221a3/2) + 2 = **3 + \u221a3/2**\n**Therefore, the distance from the plane to the top of the larger sphere is 3 + \u221a3/2 units.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Setup**\nImagine three identical spheres of radius 1 sitting on a flat surface, touching each other.  Now, imagine a larger sphere of radius 2 resting on top of these three.\n**2.  Find the Center of the Smaller Spheres**\n*  Draw a line connecting the centers of two of the smaller spheres.  This line will pass through the point where the spheres touch.\n* The distance between the centers of the two spheres is the sum of their radii, which is 1 + 1 = 2.\n*  Since the spheres are tangent, the line segment connecting their centers is a diameter of the equilateral triangle formed by connecting the centers of the three smaller spheres. \n* The height of this equilateral triangle is found using the Pythagorean Theorem:  \n  *  Half the base of the triangle is 1, so the height is \u221a(2\u00b2 - 1\u00b2) = \u221a3.\n**3. Find the Center of the Larger Sphere**\n*  The center of the larger sphere lies directly above the center of the equilateral triangle formed by the smaller spheres.\n* The distance from the center of the larger sphere to the plane is the sum of the radius of a smaller sphere and the height of the equilateral triangle, which is 1 + \u221a3.\n**4. Calculate the Total Height**\n*  The total distance from the plane to the top of the larger sphere is the sum of the distance from the plane to the center of the larger sphere and the radius of the larger sphere: (1 + \u221a3) + 2 = **3 + \u221a3**\n**Therefore, the distance from the plane to the top of the larger sphere is 3 + \u221a3.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Setup**\nImagine three spheres of radius 1, touching each other and the plane.  The larger sphere of radius 2 sits on top of them, touching all three.\n**2. Key Geometric Features**\n* **Equilateral Triangle:** The centers of the three smaller spheres form an equilateral triangle. \n* **Center of the Large Sphere:** The center of the large sphere lies directly above the centroid of the equilateral triangle formed by the centers of the smaller spheres.\n**3. Find the Height of the Triangle**\n* Let the side length of the equilateral triangle be *s*.\n*  Consider one of the smaller spheres. Draw a line from its center to the center of the large sphere. This line has length 3 (the sum of the radii).\n* This line also forms a median of the equilateral triangle (a line from a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side).\n* The medians of an equilateral triangle intersect at a point that is 2/3 of the way from each vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side.\n* Therefore, the height of the equilateral triangle is (2/3)*(3\u221a3/2) = \u221a3. \n**4. Find the Distance from the Plane to the Center of the Large Sphere**\n* The centroid of the equilateral triangle is \u221a3/3 units above the plane (one-third of the height).\n* Since the radius of the small sphere is 1, the center of a small sphere is 1 unit above the plane.\n* Therefore, the center of the large sphere is 1 + \u221a3/3 units above the plane.\n**5. Find the Total Distance**\n* The radius of the large sphere is 2.\n* The total distance from the plane to the top of the large sphere is 1 + \u221a3/3 + 2 = **3 + \u221a3/3 units**. \n",

A larger sphere (radius 2) rests on top of them, making contact with each of the smaller spheres.\n**2. Draw a Diagram**\nDraw a cross-section of the spheres. You'll see:\n* An equilateral triangle formed by the centers of the three smaller spheres.\n* The center of the larger sphere directly above the center of the equilateral triangle.\n* Lines connecting the center of the larger sphere to the centers of the smaller spheres.\n**3. Find the Height of the Triangle**\n* The side length of the equilateral triangle is 2 (the diameter of one of the smaller spheres).\n*  Use the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle (formed by drawing an altitude from a vertex to the base) to find the height of the equilateral triangle.  The height is \u221a3.\n**4. Find the Distance from the Plane to the Center of the Larger Sphere**\n* The distance from the plane to the center of one of the smaller spheres is 1 (the radius of the smaller sphere).\n* Add the height of the equilateral triangle (\u221a3) to this distance to find the distance from the plane to the center of the larger sphere: 1 + \u221a3.\n**5. Find the Total Height**\n* Add the radius of the larger sphere (2) to the distance from the plane to the center of the larger sphere: (1 + \u221a3) + 2 = 3 + \u221a3.\n**Answer:** The distance from the plane to the top of the larger sphere is **3 + \u221a3**. \n",

Apply the Pythagorean Theorem**\nLet's focus on one of the triangular faces of the tetrahedron. \n* **Hypotenuse:** The hypotenuse of this right triangle is the radius of the larger sphere (2).\n* **One Leg:** One leg of the triangle is the altitude of the equilateral triangle base (\u221a3).\n* **Other Leg:** The other leg is the height of the tetrahedron (which we want to find).\nUsing the Pythagorean Theorem:\n* 2\u00b2 = (\u221a3)\u00b2 + (height)\u00b2\n* 4 = 3 + (height)\u00b2\n* 1 = (height)\u00b2\n* height = 1\n**5.
