        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the relationships:**\n* **Volume:** The volume of a cylinder is given by  V = \u03c0r\u00b2h, where r is the radius and h is the height.\n* **Rate of change of volume:**  The problem tells us the volume is increasing at a rate of 20\u03c0 cubic meters per hour (dV/dt = 20\u03c0).\n* **Rate of change of height:** The problem also tells us the height is increasing at a rate of 4 meters per hour (dh/dt = 4).\n**2. Set up an equation:**\nWe know dV/dt = 20\u03c0 and we want to find r.  Let's differentiate the volume equation with respect to time:\ndV/dt = \u03c0(2r)(dr/dt)h + \u03c0r\u00b2(dh/dt)\n**3. Substitute known values:**\nWe know dV/dt = 20\u03c0, dh/dt = 4, and we want to find r. We don't know dr/dt (the rate of change of the radius), but we can assume that the radius is constant.  This means dr/dt = 0.\nSubstituting these values into the equation:\n20\u03c0 = \u03c0r\u00b2(4)\n**4. Solve for r:**\nSimplify the equation:\n20\u03c0 = 4\u03c0r\u00b2\nDivide both sides by 4\u03c0:\n5 = r\u00b2\nTake the square root of both sides:\n\u221a5 = r\n**Answer:** The radius of the tank is **\u221a5 meters**. \n",

Understand the Variables**\n* **Volume:** The volume of water in the tank is increasing at a rate of 20\u03c0 cubic meters per hour.\n* **Height:** The water level (height) is increasing at a rate of 4 meters per hour.\n* **Radius:** We need to find the radius of the tank.\n**2. Relate Volume, Height, and Radius**\nThe volume of a cylinder is given by: \n*  V = \u03c0r\u00b2h \nwhere:\n* V = volume\n* r = radius\n* h = height\n**3. Use the Rates of Change**\nSince the volume and height are changing with time, we can differentiate the volume equation with respect to time (t):\n* dV/dt = \u03c0(2rh dr/dt + r\u00b2 dh/dt)\n**4. Substitute Known Values**\nWe are given:\n* dV/dt = 20\u03c0 cubic meters per hour\n* dh/dt = 4 meters per hour\nWe want to find 'r' (the radius). \n**5. Simplify and Solve for 'r'**\nSubstitute the known values into the differentiated equation:\n* 20\u03c0 = \u03c0(2rh (dr/dt) + r\u00b2 * 4)\nSince we are only interested in finding the radius, and the rate of change of radius (dr/dt) isn't given, we can assume that the radius is constant and dr/dt = 0.

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Relationship**\n* The volume of water added per hour is equal to the area of the circular base times the height increase per hour.\n**2.

However, we can simplify by noticing that the volume increase is directly related to the height increase: dV/dt = \u03c0r\u00b2 dh/dt.
