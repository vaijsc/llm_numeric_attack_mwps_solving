    "problem": "The sides of the base of a triangular pyramid are 3, 4 and 5 feet and the altitude is 6 feet. What is the number of cubic feet in the volume of the pyramid?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Because we have $3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2$, the base of the pyramid is a right triangle with legs of lengths 3 and 4.  Therefore, the area of the base is $3\\cdot 4/2 = 6$ square feet.  The altitude of the pyramid is 6 feet.  The volume of the pyramid is one-third the product of the area of the base and the altitude, which is $6\\cdot 6/3=\\boxed{12}$ cubic feet.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Identify the Base:**\n* The base of the pyramid is a triangle with sides 3, 4, and 5 feet.  Notice that these sides form a Pythagorean triple (3\u00b2 + 4\u00b2 = 5\u00b2), which means the triangle is a right triangle.\n**2. Calculate the Area of the Base:**\n*  Since it's a right triangle, the area is simply (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 3 * 4 = 6 square feet.\n**3. Apply the Volume Formula:**\n* The volume of a pyramid is (1/3) * (area of base) * (height) \n* In this case, the volume is (1/3) * 6 * 6 = 12 cubic feet.\n**Therefore, the volume of the pyramid is 12 cubic feet.** \n",
