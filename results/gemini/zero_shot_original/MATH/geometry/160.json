    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The interior angles of a trapezoid consist of two pairs of congruent angles.  Therefore, if the smaller angle measure is $x$ and the larger angle measure is $4x$, then the measures of the four angles are $x$, $x$, $4x$, and $4x$.  Summing these measures and setting the result equal to $360$ degrees, we find $10x=360^\\circ\\implies x=\\boxed{36}$ degrees.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Properties of an Isosceles Trapezoid**\n* **Base angles are congruent:**  The two angles at each base of the trapezoid are equal.\n* **Opposite angles are supplementary:** The sum of any two opposite angles in the trapezoid is 180 degrees.\n**2. Set Up the Equation**\nLet...\n*  'x' represent the measure of the smallest interior angle.\n*  '4x' represent the measure of the largest interior angle.\nSince the base angles are congruent, we have two angles of 'x' and two angles of '4x'.  \n**3. Use the Supplementary Angle Property**\nThe sum of the angles in a quadrilateral is 360 degrees.  We can write an equation:\nx + x + 4x + 4x = 360\n**4. Solve for x**\n* Combine like terms: 10x = 360\n* Divide both sides by 10: x = 36\n**Answer:** The measure of the smallest interior angle in the trapezoid is **36 degrees**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Properties of Isosceles Trapezoids:**\n* **Parallel Sides:**  An isosceles trapezoid has two parallel sides (called bases) and two non-parallel sides (called legs) that are congruent.\n* **Equal Base Angles:** The two base angles on each side of the trapezoid are equal.\n**2. Set Up the Equations:**\n* Let 'x' represent the measure of the smallest interior angle.\n* The largest interior angle is 4 times the smallest, so it measures 4x.\n**3. Use Angle Relationships:**\n* **Consecutive Interior Angles:**  The two interior angles on the same side of a transversal line (the legs of the trapezoid) are supplementary.  This means they add up to 180 degrees. \n* **Equal Base Angles:**  The two base angles on each side of the trapezoid are equal.\n**4. Formulate and Solve the Equation:**\n* Since the smallest angle and the largest angle are consecutive interior angles, we have: x + 4x = 180\n* Combine like terms: 5x = 180\n* Divide both sides by 5: x = 36\n**Answer:** The measure of the smallest interior angle in the trapezoid is **36 degrees**. \n",

Set up Equations**\nLet:\n*  'x' represent the measure of the smallest interior angle.\n* '4x' represent the measure of the largest interior angle.\nSince the base angles are equal, we know:\n* The smallest angle is opposite one base angle, so the other base angle also measures 'x' degrees.\n* The largest angle is opposite the other base angle, so the other base angle also measures '4x' degrees.\n**3. Use the Supplementary Angle Property**\nThe two opposite angles on either side of the trapezoid are supplementary.  Therefore:\n* x + 4x = 180\n**4.
