        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the surface area of the container:**\n* **Top and Bottom:** Each is 10\" x 12\" = 120 square inches.\n* **Front and Back:** Each is 10\" x 10\" = 100 square inches.\n* **Sides:** Each is 12\" x 10\" = 120 square inches.\nTotal surface area: 2(120) + 2(100) + 2(120) = 680 square inches.\n**2. Calculate the cost of the aluminum:**\n* Cost per square inch: $0.05\n* Total surface area: 680 square inches\n* Total cost: $0.05/square inch * 680 square inches = $34\n**Answer:** The cost of the aluminum used to make one container is **$34**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the surface area of the container:**\n* **Top and Bottom:**  Each is a 10\" x 12\" rectangle, so the area of one is 10 * 12 = 120 square inches.  Since there are two, that's 120 * 2 = 240 square inches.\n* **Front and Back:** Each is a 10\" x 10\" square, so the area of one is 10 * 10 = 100 square inches.  Since there are two, that's 100 * 2 = 200 square inches.\n* **Sides:** Each is a 12\" x 10\" rectangle, so the area of one is 12 * 10 = 120 square inches. Since there are two, that's 120 * 2 = 240 square inches.\n* **Total Surface Area:** 240 + 200 + 240 = 680 square inches\n**2. Calculate the cost of the aluminum:**\n* **Cost per square inch:** $0.05 \n* **Total surface area:** 680 square inches\n* **Total cost:** $0.05/square inch * 680 square inches = **$34.00**\n**Therefore, the cost of the aluminum used to make one container is $34.00.** \n",
