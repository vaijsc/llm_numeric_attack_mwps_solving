        "Let's break down the problem and solve it step by step:\n**1. Visualize the Problem**\nImagine a circle with a radius drawn. Now, imagine a chord (a line segment connecting two points on the circle) perpendicular to the radius at the midpoint of the radius. This chord divides the circle into two regions, one larger and one smaller.\n[asy]\nunitsize(1 cm);\npair A, B, C, O;\nO = (0,0);\nA = dir(110);\nB = dir(70);\nC = (O + A)/2;\ndraw(Circle(O,1));\ndraw(A--B);\ndraw(O--A);\ndraw(O--B);\ndraw(rightanglemark(O,C,A,10));\nlabel(\"$O$\", O, SW);\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, NW);\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, NE);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, S);\n[/asy]\n**2. Key Geometric Relationships**\n* **Right Triangle:** The chord, the radius, and half of the chord form a right triangle.\n* **Pythagorean Theorem:** Since we have a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem:  (radius)\u00b2 = (half-chord)\u00b2 + (distance from center to chord)\u00b2 \n* **Area of a Sector:** The area of a sector (the part of the circle enclosed by two radii and an arc) is (1/2) * (angle in radians) * (radius)\u00b2.\n* **Area of a Triangle:** The area of a triangle is (1/2) * (base) * (height).\n**3. Setting up the Calculation**\nLet:\n*  'r' be the radius of the circle\n*  'x' be the length of half the chord\n*  'h' be the distance from the center of the circle to the chord (this is also the height of the right triangle formed by the chord, radius, and half-chord)\nFrom the Pythagorean Theorem:  r\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + h\u00b2\nThe area of the larger region is the area of the whole circle minus the area of the smaller region.  \n* Area of the whole circle = \u03c0r\u00b2\n* Area of the smaller region =  (area of the sector) - (area of the triangle)\n**4. Finding the Areas**\n* **Area of the sector:** The central angle of the sector is twice the angle of the right triangle, which we can find using trigonometry.  Let \u03b8 be the angle of the right triangle, then:\n   *  cos(\u03b8) = h/r\n   *  Area of sector = (1/2) * (2\u03b8) * r\u00b2 = \u03b8r\u00b2 \n* **Area of the triangle:** The base of the triangle is 2x and the height is h. \n   * Area of triangle = (1/2) * (2x) * h = xh \n**5.  Calculating the Ratio**\nLet's find the ratio of the area of the larger region to the area of the smaller region:\n* Area of larger region = \u03c0r\u00b2 - (\u03b8r\u00b2 - xh) = \u03c0r\u00b2 - \u03b8r\u00b2 + xh\n* Area of smaller region = \u03b8r\u00b2 - xh\nTherefore, the ratio is:\n(\u03c0r\u00b2 - \u03b8r\u00b2 + xh) / (\u03b8r\u00b2 - xh)\n**6. Simplifying the Ratio**\nWe can simplify the ratio by factoring out r\u00b2 and xh:\n[(\u03c0 - \u03b8)r\u00b2 + xh] / [(\u03b8)r\u00b2 - xh]\nNow, let's use the trigonometric relationships we derived earlier to get rid of \u03b8 and h:\n* cos(\u03b8) = h/r  =>  h = r*cos(\u03b8)\n* sin(\u03b8) = x/r  =>  x = r*sin(\u03b8)\nSubstitute these into the ratio:\n[ (\u03c0 - \u03b8)r\u00b2 + (r*sin(\u03b8))*(r*cos(\u03b8)) ] / [ (\u03b8)r\u00b2 - (r*sin(\u03b8))*(r*cos(\u03b8)) ]\nSimplify further:\n[ (\u03c0 - \u03b8)r\u00b2 + r\u00b2sin(\u03b8)cos(\u03b8) ] / [ (\u03b8)r\u00b2 - r\u00b2sin(\u03b8)cos(\u03b8) ]\nFactor out r\u00b2:\n[ (\u03c0 - \u03b8) + sin(\u03b8)cos(\u03b8) ] / [ (\u03b8) - sin(\u03b8)cos(\u03b8) ]\n**7. Expressing in the Desired Form**\nWe want to express the ratio in the form  (a\u03c0 + b\u221ac) / (d\u03c0 - e\u221af).  To do this, we need to use some trigonometric identities:\n* **Double Angle Identity:**  sin(2\u03b8) = 2sin(\u03b8)cos(\u03b8)\n* **Angle Addition Identity:**  cos(\u03c0/2 - \u03b8) = sin(\u03b8)\nLet's rewrite our ratio using these identities:\n[ (\u03c0 - \u03b8) + (1/2)sin(2\u03b8) ] / [ (\u03b8) - (1/2)sin(2\u03b8) ]\nNow, substitute \u03b8 = \u03c0/2 - 2\u03b8:\n[ (\u03c0 - (\u03c0/2 - 2\u03b8)) + (1/2)sin(2(\u03c0/2 - 2\u03b8)) ] / [ (\u03c0/2 - 2\u03b8) - (1/2)sin(2(\u03c0/2 - 2\u03b8)) ]\nSimplify:\n[ (\u03c0/2 + 2\u03b8) + (1/2)cos(4\u03b8) ] / [ (\u03c0/2 - 2\u03b8) - (1/2)cos(4\u03b8) ]\n**8. Final Calculation**\nNow, we can see that the ratio is in the desired form. We can express it as:\n(1/2 * \u03c0 + 2\u03b8 + (1/2)cos(4\u03b8)) / (1/2 * \u03c0 - 2\u03b8 - (1/2)cos(4\u03b8))\nTherefore:\n* a = 1\n* b = 1\n* c = 1 \n* d = 1\n* e = 1\n* f = 1\nFinally, the product a * b * c * d * e * f = 1 * 1 * 1 * 1 * 1 * 1 = 1.\n**The remainder when 1 is divided by 1000 is ** **0.**",

Identify Key Relationships**\n* **Right Triangles:**  Triangles OBM and OCM are right triangles.\n* **Congruence:**  Since M is the midpoint of OA, triangles OBM and OCM are congruent.\n* **Pythagorean Theorem:**  We can use the Pythagorean Theorem on triangle OBM (or OCM) to relate the radius, the chord, and the distance from the center of the circle to the chord.\n**3. Set Up Equations**\nLet:\n*  r = the radius of the circle\n*  s = the length of the chord BC\n*  h = OM = AM (the distance from the center of the circle to the chord)\nUsing the Pythagorean Theorem on triangle OBM:\n  r\u00b2 = h\u00b2 + (s/2)\u00b2\nSince h = r/2, we can substitute and simplify:\n  r\u00b2 = (r/2)\u00b2 + (s/2)\u00b2\n  r\u00b2 = r\u00b2/4 + s\u00b2/4\n  3r\u00b2/4 = s\u00b2/4\n  3r\u00b2 = s\u00b2\n**4. Find the Areas**\n* **Area of the Smaller Region:**  This is the area of sector OBC minus the area of triangle OBC.\n   - Area of sector OBC = (1/2)r\u00b2 * (angle BOC)\n   - Area of triangle OBC = (1/2) * s * h \nTo find angle BOC, note that triangle OBC is isosceles, so angle BOC = 2 * angle OBC. Also, angle OBC is half of angle AOB (a central angle that intercepts the same arc as angle BOC). Since angle AOB is a straight angle, we have:\n  angle BOC = 2 * angle OBC = 2 * (1/2) * angle AOB = angle AOB = 180 degrees\nTherefore, the area of sector OBC = (1/2)r\u00b2 * (180\u00b0) = 90r\u00b2.\nThe area of triangle OBC = (1/2) * s * h = (1/2) * s * (r/2) = (1/4) * s * r.\nSo, the area of the smaller region is 90r\u00b2 - (1/4) * s * r.\n* **Area of the Larger Region:**  This is the area of the circle minus the area of the smaller region.\n   - Area of the circle = \u03c0r\u00b2\n   - Area of the larger region = \u03c0r\u00b2 - (90r\u00b2 - (1/4) * s * r)\n**5. Calculate the Ratio**\nThe ratio of the area of the larger region to the area of the smaller region is:\n[ (\u03c0r\u00b2 - (90r\u00b2 - (1/4) * s * r)) / (90r\u00b2 - (1/4) * s * r) ] = [ (\u03c0r\u00b2 - 90r\u00b2 + (1/4) * s * r) / (90r\u00b2 - (1/4) * s * r) ]\nSubstitute s\u00b2 = 3r\u00b2 from our earlier result:\n= [ (\u03c0r\u00b2 - 90r\u00b2 + (1/4) * \u221a(3r\u00b2) * r) / (90r\u00b2 - (1/4) * \u221a(3r\u00b2) * r) ]\nSimplify:\n= [ (\u03c0 - 90 + \u221a3/4) / (90 - \u221a3/4) ]\n**6. Simplify and Find the Remainder**\nMultiply numerator and denominator by 4 to get rid of the fractions:\n= [ (4\u03c0 - 360 + \u221a3) / (360 - \u221a3) ]\nThis is in the desired form.  The product  a \u22c5 b \u22c5 c \u22c5 d \u22c5 e \u22c5 f = 4 \u22c5 1 \u22c5 3 \u22c5 360 \u22c5 1 \u22c5 3 = 4320.  The remainder when this product is divided by 1000 is **320**. \n",
