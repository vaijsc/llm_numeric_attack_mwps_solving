        "Here's how to solve this problem using the Triangle Inequality Theorem:\n**Understanding the Triangle Inequality Theorem**\nThe Triangle Inequality Theorem states that the sum of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side.\n**Applying the Theorem**\n1. **Consider the smallest possible third side:**  If the third side were 1 unit long, it wouldn't satisfy the theorem because 1 + 1 < 3.\n2. **Consider the largest possible third side:** If the third side were 4 units long, it also wouldn't satisfy the theorem because 1 + 3 = 4.\n3. **The only remaining possibility:** The only integer length for the third side that satisfies the Triangle Inequality Theorem is **2 units**.\n**Why 2 units works:**\n* 1 + 2 > 3 \n* 2 + 3 > 1\n* 1 + 3 > 2 \n**Therefore, the length of the third side is 2 units.** \n",
