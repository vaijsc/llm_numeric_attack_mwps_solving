        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the coordinates of point F:**\n* Since D is the midpoint of AB, the coordinates of D are the average of the coordinates of A and B: D = ((0+0)/2, (6+0)/2) = (0,3).\n* Since E is the midpoint of BC, the coordinates of E are the average of the coordinates of B and C: E = ((0+8)/2, (0+0)/2) = (4,0).\n*  Since F is on line segment AE, we can find its coordinates using the slope formula. The slope of AE is (6-0)/(0-4) = -3/2.  Let F have coordinates (x,y).  Then the slope of AF is (y-6)/(x-0) = -3/2.  Solving for y gives us y = -3x/2 + 6.  Also, the slope of EF is (y-0)/(x-4) = -3/2.  Solving for y gives us y = -3x/2 + 6.  Since both slopes are equal to -3/2, we know that F lies on line segment AE.  Setting the two expressions for y equal to each other, we get -3x/2 + 6 = -3x/2 + 6.  This equation is true for all values of x, so F can be any point on AE.  However, we are given that F is the intersection of AE and line segment CD.  We can find the equation of CD by using the slope-intercept form of a line.  The slope of CD is (3-0)/(0-8) = -3/8.  The y-intercept of CD is 3.  Therefore, the equation of CD is y = -3x/8 + 3.  Setting this equation equal to y = -3x/2 + 6, we get -3x/8 + 3 = -3x/2 + 6.  Solving for x, we get x = 8/3.  Substituting this value of x into either equation, we get y = 2.  Therefore, the coordinates of F are (8/3, 2).\n**2. Divide quadrilateral DBEF into simpler shapes:**\n* Draw a line segment from D to F.  This divides quadrilateral DBEF into two triangles:  triangle DFE and triangle DFB.\n[asy]\nsize(180); defaultpen(linewidth(.7pt)+fontsize(10pt));\npair A, B, C, D, E, F;\nA=(0,6);\nB=(0,0);\nC=(8,0);\nD=(0,3);\nE=(4,0);\nF=(8/3,2);\ndraw(E--A--C--D);\ndraw((-1,0)--(10,0), EndArrow);\ndraw((0,-1)--(0,8), EndArrow);\ndraw(D--F);\nlabel(\"$A(0,6)$\", A, W);\nlabel(\"$B(0,0)$\", B, SW);\nlabel(\"$C(8,0)$\", C, S);\nlabel(\"$D$\", D, W);\nlabel(\"$E$\", E, S);\nlabel(\"$F$\", F, SW);\nlabel(\"$x$\", (10,0), dir(0));\nlabel(\"$y$\", (0,8), dir(90));\n[/asy]\n**3. Find the area of each triangle:**\n* **Triangle DFE:**\n   * Base = DE = 4 units (since E is the midpoint of BC)\n   * Height = DF = 2 units (since the y-coordinate of F is 2 and the y-coordinate of D is 3)\n   * Area = (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 4 * 2 = 4 square units\n* **Triangle DFB:**\n   * Base = DB = 3 units (since D is the midpoint of AB)\n   * Height =  the perpendicular distance from F to line segment DB.  This height is the difference between the y-coordinate of F (2) and the y-coordinate of the foot of the perpendicular (which is the same as the y-coordinate of D, 3).  So, the height is 1 unit.\n   * Area = (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 3 * 1 = 3/2 square units\n**4.

        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Understanding the Geometry**\n* **Midpoints:**  Since D and E are midpoints, we know that AD = DB and BE = EC.\n* **Triangles:** Notice that triangle ABC is divided into smaller triangles:  ADE, DBE, and EFC. \n* **Parallel Lines:** Line segment DE is parallel to line segment AC (because it connects midpoints of two sides of the triangle). \n**2. Area Calculations**\n* **Area of Triangle ABC:**  The base of triangle ABC is BC = 8 and the height is AB = 6. So, the area of triangle ABC is (1/2)(8)(6) = 24.\n* **Area of Triangle ADE:**  Since DE is parallel to AC, triangle ADE is similar to triangle ABC. The ratio of their sides is 1:2 (since D and E are midpoints).  Therefore, the area of triangle ADE is 1/4 the area of triangle ABC, which is (1/4)(24) = 6.\n* **Area of Triangle EFC:** Triangle EFC is also similar to triangle ABC with a side ratio of 1:2. Its area is also (1/4)(24) = 6.\n**3. Finding the Area of Quadrilateral DBEF**\n* **Area of Triangle DBE:**  The area of triangle DBE is half the area of triangle ABC minus the areas of triangles ADE and EFC.  So, the area of triangle DBE is (1/2)(24) - 6 - 6 = 6.\n* **Area of Quadrilateral DBEF:** The area of quadrilateral DBEF is the sum of the areas of triangle DBE and triangle EFC:  6 + 6 = **12**.\n**Therefore, the area of quadrilateral DBEF is 12 square units.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the coordinates of point F:**\n* Since D and E are midpoints, we can find the coordinates of F using the midpoint formula.  \n* The midpoint of a line segment with endpoints $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is:  [(x_1 + x_2)/2, (y_1 + y_2)/2].\n* Applying this to segment AD, we get: D = [(0 + 0)/2, (6 + 0)/2] = (0, 3).\n* Applying this to segment BC, we get: E = [(0 + 8)/2, (0 + 0)/2] = (4, 0).\n* To find F, we use the midpoint formula on DE:  F = [(0 + 4)/2, (3 + 0)/2] = (2, 3/2).\n**2.
