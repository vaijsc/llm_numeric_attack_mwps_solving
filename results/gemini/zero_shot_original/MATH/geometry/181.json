        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Understand the Properties**\n* **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** An inscribed angle's measure is half the measure of its intercepted arc.\n* **Diameter:** A diameter of a circle passes through the center and divides the circle into two equal semicircles.\n* **Central Angle:** An angle formed by two radii of a circle is a central angle. A central angle's measure is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.\n**2. Apply the Properties**\n* Since $AB$ is a diameter, arc $ACB$ is a semicircle, which has a measure of $180^\\circ$.\n*  Angle $A$ intercepts arc $BC$, so by the Inscribed Angle Theorem,  $\\angle A = \\frac{1}{2} \\text{measure of arc } BC = 14^\\circ$.  Therefore, arc $BC$ has a measure of $28^\\circ$.\n*  Angle $B$ intercepts arc $AC$, which is the remaining portion of the semicircle.  So, the measure of arc $AC$ is $180^\\circ - 28^\\circ = 152^\\circ$.\n*  By the Inscribed Angle Theorem, $\\angle B = \\frac{1}{2} \\text{measure of arc } AC = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 152^\\circ = \\boxed{76^\\circ}$. \n",

Understand the properties:**\n* **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** An inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc.\n* **Diameter:** A diameter of a circle passes through the center and divides the circle into two equal semicircles.\n* **Angles in a triangle:** The angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.\n**2. Apply the properties:**\n* Since AB is a diameter, arc AB is a semicircle, and central angle AOB is 180 degrees.\n* Angle ACB is an inscribed angle that subtends arc AB, so its measure is half of angle AOB, which is 180/2 = 90 degrees.\n* Therefore, triangle ABC is a right triangle with right angle at C.\n**3. Find angle B:**\n* We know angle A is 14 degrees and angle C is 90 degrees.\n* Since the angles in a triangle sum to 180 degrees, angle B is 180 - 14 - 90 = **76 degrees**.\n**Therefore, angle B has a measure of 76 degrees.** \n",

Since AB is a diameter, arc ACB is a semicircle, which measures 180 degrees.\n2. **Applying the Theorem:**  Angle A intercepts arc ACB. Therefore,  \u2220A = (1/2) * 180\u00b0 = 90\u00b0.\n3. **Angle Sum Property:**  The angles of a triangle add up to 180 degrees.  So,  \u2220A + \u2220B + \u2220C = 180\u00b0.\n4. **Solving for \u2220B:**  We know \u2220A = 90\u00b0 and \u2220A = 14\u00b0.  Substituting into the equation: 90\u00b0 + 14\u00b0 + \u2220C = 180\u00b0.  Solving for \u2220C, we get \u2220C = 76\u00b0.\n5. **Finding \u2220B:** Since the angles of a triangle add up to 180 degrees, \u2220B = 180\u00b0 - 90\u00b0 - 14\u00b0 = **76\u00b0**.\n**Therefore, \u2220B measures 76 degrees.** \n",
