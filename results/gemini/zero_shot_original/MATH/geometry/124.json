        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Concept**\n* We need to find the number of smaller pipes that have the same total volume as one larger pipe. \n* Volume is the amount of space a three-dimensional object occupies.\n**2. Calculate the Volume of the Larger Pipe**\n* **Radius:** The diameter of the larger pipe is 12 inches, so its radius is 12 inches / 2 = 6 inches.\n* **Formula:** The volume of a cylinder is \u03c0 * radius\u00b2 * height.\n* **Volume:**  \u03c0 * (6 inches)\u00b2 * 4 feet = \u03c0 * 36 inches\u00b2 * 48 inches (convert feet to inches) = 5428.8\u03c0 cubic inches\n**3. Calculate the Volume of a Smaller Pipe**\n* **Radius:** The diameter of the smaller pipe is 2 inches, so its radius is 2 inches / 2 = 1 inch.\n* **Volume:** \u03c0 * (1 inch)\u00b2 * 4 feet = \u03c0 * 1 inch\u00b2 * 48 inches = 48\u03c0 cubic inches\n**4. Find the Number of Smaller Pipes**\n* **Divide the volume of the larger pipe by the volume of a smaller pipe:** 5428.8\u03c0 cubic inches / 48\u03c0 cubic inches = 113\n**Answer:** You would need 113 congruent 4-foot tall cylindrical pipes with an inside diameter of 2 inches to hold the same amount of water as one pipe with an inside diameter of 12 inches. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Relationship**\n* We're dealing with cylinders, and we need to find how many smaller cylinders hold the same volume as one larger cylinder.\n* The volume of a cylinder is calculated using the formula: **Volume = \u03c0r\u00b2h**, where:\n    *  \u03c0 (pi) is a mathematical constant (approximately 3.14)\n    *  r is the radius of the base \n    *  h is the height \n**2. Calculate the Volume of the Large Pipe**\n* The large pipe has a diameter of 12 inches, so its radius is 12/2 = 6 inches.\n* The height is 4 feet, which is 4 * 12 = 48 inches.\n* Volume of large pipe = \u03c0 * (6 inches)\u00b2 * 48 inches = 6871.95 cubic inches (approximately)\n**3. Calculate the Volume of a Small Pipe**\n* The small pipe has a diameter of 2 inches, so its radius is 2/2 = 1 inch.\n* The height is the same, 48 inches.\n* Volume of small pipe = \u03c0 * (1 inch)\u00b2 * 48 inches = 150.796 cubic inches (approximately)\n**4. Determine the Number of Small Pipes**\n* Divide the volume of the large pipe by the volume of a small pipe: 6871.95 cubic inches / 150.796 cubic inches \u2248 45.58\n**Answer:** You would need approximately **46** congruent 4-foot tall cylindrical pipes with an inside diameter of 2 inches to hold the same amount of water as one pipe of the same height with an inside diameter of 12 inches. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Relationship Between Volume and Dimensions**\n* The volume of a cylinder is calculated using the formula:  **Volume = \u03c0 * (radius)\u00b2 * height**\n**2.  Calculate the Volume of the Large Pipe**\n* **Radius of large pipe:** 12 inches / 2 = 6 inches\n* **Volume of large pipe:** \u03c0 * (6 inches)\u00b2 * 4 feet = \u03c0 * 36 inches\u00b2 * 48 inches (converting feet to inches) = 5428.8\u03c0 cubic inches\n**3.

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Concept**\n* **Volume:** We need to figure out how much water each pipe can hold. The volume of a cylinder is calculated using the formula:  **Volume = \u03c0 * radius\u00b2 * height** \n* **Congruent:** This means all the smaller pipes have the same dimensions.\n**2. Calculate the Volume of the Large Pipe**\n* **Radius:** The large pipe has a diameter of 12 inches, so its radius is 12 inches / 2 = 6 inches.\n* **Height:** The height is 4 feet, which is equal to 48 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches).\n* **Volume:**  Volume = \u03c0 * (6 inches)\u00b2 * 48 inches = 6825.6\u03c0 cubic inches\n**3. Calculate the Volume of One Small Pipe**\n* **Radius:** The small pipe has a diameter of 2 inches, so its radius is 2 inches / 2 = 1 inch.\n* **Height:** The height is the same as the large pipe, 48 inches.\n* **Volume:**  Volume = \u03c0 * (1 inch)\u00b2 * 48 inches = 48\u03c0 cubic inches\n**4. Determine the Number of Small Pipes**\n* **Divide the large pipe's volume by the small pipe's volume:** 6825.6\u03c0 cubic inches / 48\u03c0 cubic inches = 142.2 \n**5. Round Up**\n* Since you can't have a fraction of a pipe, you need to round up to the nearest whole number.  \n**Answer:** You would need **143** congruent 4-foot tall cylindrical pipes with an inside diameter of 2 inches to hold the same amount of water as one pipe with an inside diameter of 12 inches. \n",
