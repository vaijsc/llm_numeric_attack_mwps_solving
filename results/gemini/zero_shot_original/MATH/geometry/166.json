        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualizing the Problem**\nImagine a regular tetrahedron. Point P is the center of the tetrahedron, equidistant from all four vertices.  Point Q lies on the base triangle BCD, directly below point P.\n**2. Finding the Key Geometric Shapes**\n* **Equilateral Triangles:** Each face of the tetrahedron is an equilateral triangle.\n* **Pyramid:** The tetrahedron itself can be viewed as a pyramid with base BCD and apex A.\n* **Right Triangle:**  Triangle APQ is a right triangle, with a right angle at Q. \n**3. Understanding the Geometry**\n* **Median and Centroid:**  The line segment AP is a median of triangle ABC (connecting a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side). Since P is equidistant from all vertices, it's also the centroid of triangle ABC.\n* **Centroid Property:** The centroid divides each median in a 2:1 ratio.  This means that AP = (2/3)AQ.\n**4. Finding the Ratio**\nSince AP = (2/3)AQ, we can rearrange this to find the ratio PQ/AQ:\n* AQ - AP = PQ\n* AQ - (2/3)AQ = PQ\n* (1/3)AQ = PQ\n* PQ/AQ = **1/3**\n**Therefore, the ratio PQ/AQ is 1/3.** \n",
        "Here's a step-by-step solution to find the ratio PQ/AQ:\n**1. Understanding the Geometry**\n* **Equidistant Point:**  Since point P is equidistant from A, B, C, and D, it must be the **centroid** of the tetrahedron. This is the point where all the medians of the tetrahedron intersect. \n* **Median:** A median of a tetrahedron is a line segment connecting a vertex to the centroid of the opposite face.\n**2. Key Properties of the Centroid**\n* **Dividing Medians:** The centroid divides each median in a 2:1 ratio. This means the distance from a vertex to the centroid is twice the distance from the centroid to the midpoint of the opposite face.\n* **Location:**  The centroid lies one-fourth of the way from the base of a median to its vertex.\n**3. Visualizing the Problem**\nImagine drawing a median from vertex A to the centroid P.  Since Q lies on the extension of AP and intersects face BCD, we can visualize this:\n* AP is a portion of the median from A to the centroid.\n* PQ is the extension of AP beyond the centroid P and intersects face BCD.\n**4. Applying the Properties**\nLet's use the fact that the centroid divides a median in a 2:1 ratio:\n*  Let the length of AP be 'x'. \n*  Since P is the centroid, the distance from P to the midpoint of face BCD is x/2.\n*  The total length of the median from A to the midpoint of face BCD is 3x/2 (x + x/2).\n**5. Finding PQ**\n* Since PQ is the extension of AP beyond the centroid, its length is (3x/2) - x = x/2.\n**6. Calculating the Ratio**\nNow we can find the ratio PQ/AQ:\n* PQ = x/2\n* AQ = x + x/2 = 3x/2\nTherefore, PQ/AQ = (x/2) / (3x/2) = **1/3**\n**Answer:** The ratio PQ/AQ is **1/3**. \n",

Key Properties**\n* **Centroid divides median in a 2:1 ratio:** The centroid of a tetrahedron divides each median in a 2:1 ratio. This means that if we consider median AP, then AQ is twice the length of PQ. \n**3. Finding the Ratio**\nSince AQ = 2PQ,  we have:\n```\nPQ/AQ = PQ/(2PQ) = 1/2\n```\n**Therefore, the ratio PQ/AQ is 1/2.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understanding the Geometry**\n* **Regular Tetrahedron:**  All faces are congruent equilateral triangles. \n* **Point P:**  Since P is equidistant from all vertices, it's the **circumcenter** of the tetrahedron.  This means it's also the **centroid** (the point where the medians intersect). \n* **Point Q:**  Q is the foot of the perpendicular from P to face BCD. This means PQ is the altitude of the tetrahedron.\n**2.  Key Properties**\n* **Centroid Property:** The centroid of a triangle divides each median in a 2:1 ratio.\n* **Pythagorean Theorem:**  We'll use this to relate the lengths of PQ, AQ, and the side length of the tetrahedron.\n**3.  Setting Up the Solution**\nLet's assume the side length of the tetrahedron is *s*.\n* **Find the length of a median of an equilateral triangle:**  The median of an equilateral triangle is also an altitude.  Using the 30-60-90 triangle, we find the median (and altitude) to be  *s\u221a3/2*.\n* **Find the length of AP:**  Since P is the centroid, AP is 2/3 of the median of triangle ABC. Therefore, *AP = (2/3) * (s\u221a3/2) = s\u221a3/3*.\n* **Find the length of PQ:**  Triangle APQ is a right triangle.  We know AP and need to find PQ.  \n**4.  Calculating the Ratio**\n* **Using the Centroid Property:**  Consider triangle ABD.  Since P is the centroid, BP is 1/3 of the median BD.  Thus, BP = (1/3) * (s\u221a3/2) = s\u221a3/6.\n* **Using the Pythagorean Theorem in triangle APB:**  *AB\u00b2 = AP\u00b2 + BP\u00b2*\n   *  *s\u00b2 = (s\u221a3/3)\u00b2 + (s\u221a3/6)\u00b2*\n   *  *s\u00b2 = s\u00b2/3 + s\u00b2/12*\n   *  *s\u00b2 = 5s\u00b2/12*\n   *  *s\u00b2 = 12*\n* **Finding PQ in triangle APQ:**  *PQ\u00b2 = AP\u00b2 - AQ\u00b2*\n   *  *PQ\u00b2 = (s\u221a3/3)\u00b2 - (s\u221a3/3 - PQ)\u00b2*  (Since AQ = AP - PQ)\n   *  *PQ\u00b2 = s\u00b2/3 - (s\u00b2/3 - 2s\u221a3/3 * PQ + PQ\u00b2) *\n   *  *2PQ\u00b2 = 2s\u221a3/3 * PQ*\n   *  *PQ = s\u221a3/3*\n* **Finally, the ratio:** *PQ/AQ = (s\u221a3/3) / (s\u221a3/3 - PQ)*\n    *  *PQ/AQ = (s\u221a3/3) / (s\u221a3/3 - s\u221a3/3)*\n    *  *PQ/AQ = (s\u221a3/3) / 0* \n    *  *PQ/AQ = **undefined***\n**Conclusion**\nThe ratio PQ/AQ is undefined because Q coincides with P.  Since P is the circumcenter of the tetrahedron, the perpendicular from P to any face will intersect that face at P itself. \n",
        "Here's a step-by-step solution to find the ratio PQ/AQ:\n**1. Understanding the Geometry**\n* **Point P:**  Since P is equidistant from A, B, C, and D, it's the **circumcenter** of the tetrahedron.  This means it lies on the perpendicular bisectors of each edge of the tetrahedron.\n* **Point Q:**  Q is the foot of the perpendicular from P to face BCD. This makes PQ the **altitude** of the tetrahedron.\n**2. Visualizing the Situation**\nImagine the tetrahedron with its base BCD and point A at the apex.  The line AP passes through the center of the base (the centroid of triangle BCD) and is perpendicular to the base.\n[asy]\nimport three;\nsize(180);\ncurrentprojection = perspective(6,3,2);\ntriple A, B, C, D, P, Q;\nA = (0,0,1);\nB = (sqrt(2)/2,-sqrt(2)/2,0);\nC = (sqrt(2)/2,sqrt(2)/2,0);\nD = (-sqrt(2),0,0);\nP = (A + B + C + D)/4;\nQ = (B + C + D)/3;\ndraw(B--C--D--cycle);\ndraw(A--B);\ndraw(A--C);\ndraw(A--D);\ndraw(A--P--Q,dashed);\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, N);\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, SW);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, SE);\nlabel(\"$D$\", D, W);\nlabel(\"$P$\", P, dir(0));\nlabel(\"$Q$\", Q, S);\n[/asy]\n**3. Finding the Ratio**\n* **Focus on Triangle APQ:**  This triangle is a right triangle with right angle at Q.  \n* **Key Relationship:**  We can use the fact that the medians of a triangle intersect at a point that divides each median in a 2:1 ratio.\n**4. Applying the Median Property**\n* **AP is a median:**  Since P is the circumcenter, AP bisects BC. \n* **AQ is 2/3 of AP:** The medians of triangle BCD intersect at Q, which is 2/3 of the way from the midpoint of BC to point A (and thus 2/3 of the way from A to P).\n**5.  Calculating the Ratio**\nSince AQ is 2/3 of AP, then PQ must be 1/3 of AP.  Therefore:\n*  PQ/AQ = (1/3)/(2/3) = **1/2** \n**Answer:** The ratio PQ/AQ is **1/2**. \n"
