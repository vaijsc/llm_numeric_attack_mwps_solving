Draw line $XC$, which divides the shaded region into two equal shaded regions, one blue and one grey.  We will calculate the area of the blue region and multiply it by 2 to yield the total shaded area.\n\nTo calculate the area of the blue region, notice that it is equal to the area of the quarter circle bounded by arc $CX$, centered at $Y$, minus the area of triangle $\\triangle CXY$.  The quarter circle has radius $8/2=4$ and area \\[\\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\pi (4)^2 = 4\\pi.\\]The triangle has area \\[\\frac{1}{2} (4)(4) = 8.\\]Hence the blue region has area $4\\pi - 8$.  The entire shaded region has area twice this, which is $2(4\\pi-8) = \\boxed{8\\pi - 16}$.",

        "1. **Area of the square:**  The area of square $ABCD$ is $AB^2 = 8^2 = 64$ square centimeters.\n2. **Area of the semicircles:** Each semicircle has a radius of $AB/2 = 4$ cm. The area of a full circle with radius 4 is $\\pi (4^2) = 16\\pi$ square centimeters, so each semicircle has an area of $16\\pi/2 = 8\\pi$ square centimeters.\n3. **Area of the unshaded region:** The unshaded region consists of two semicircles, so its area is $2(8\\pi) = 16\\pi$ square centimeters.\n4. **Area of the shaded region:** The shaded region is the square minus the unshaded region.
