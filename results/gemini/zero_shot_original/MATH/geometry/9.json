Also, thanks to SAS Similarity (or AA also works), we see that $\\triangle ABC \\sim \\triangle ADE.$ That means that $ABC$ is also a $3:4:5$ triangle. Since $AB = 9,$ that means that $AC = 15$ and $BC = 12.$\n\nWe find the shaded area of $BCED$ by subtracting the areas of $ABC$ and $ADE.$ The area of $ABC$ is simply $\\dfrac{9 \\cdot 12}{2} = 54,$ and the area of $ADE$ is $\\dfrac{6 \\cdot 8}{2} = 24.$ Therefore, our desired area is $54 - 24 = \\boxed{30} \\text{ cm}^2.$",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the height of the white triangle:**\n* The white triangle is a right triangle with a hypotenuse of 10 and a base of 3.\n* We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the height:  \n   * a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n   * 3\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 10\u00b2\n   * 9 + b\u00b2 = 100\n   * b\u00b2 = 91\n   * b = \u221a91  (This is the height of the white triangle)\n**2. Find the area of the entire rectangle:**\n* The rectangle has a base of 9 cm and a height of 12 cm.\n* Area of rectangle = base \u00d7 height = 9 cm \u00d7 12 cm = 108 cm\u00b2\n**3. Find the area of the white triangle:**\n* Area of triangle = (1/2) \u00d7 base \u00d7 height = (1/2) \u00d7 3 cm \u00d7 \u221a91 cm = (3\u221a91)/2 cm\u00b2\n**4. Find the area of the shaded region:**\n* Area of shaded region = Area of rectangle - Area of white triangle\n* Area of shaded region = 108 cm\u00b2 - (3\u221a91)/2 cm\u00b2\n**Therefore, the number of square centimeters in the shaded area is 108 - (3\u221a91)/2 cm\u00b2.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Find the missing side of the white triangle:**\n* We know the hypotenuse is 10 and one leg is 6.\n* Use the Pythagorean theorem:  a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n* 6\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 10\u00b2\n* 36 + b\u00b2 = 100\n* b\u00b2 = 64\n* b = 8 \n**2. Find the area of the entire rectangle:**\n* Length = 9 cm\n* Width = 12 cm\n* Area = length * width = 9 * 12 = 108 square cm\n**3. Find the area of the white triangle:**\n* Base = 8 cm \n* Height = 6 cm\n* Area = (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 8 * 6 = 24 square cm\n**4.  Subtract the area of the white triangle from the area of the rectangle to find the shaded area:**\n* Shaded area = 108 square cm - 24 square cm = 84 square cm\n**Therefore, there are 84 square centimeters in the shaded area.** \n",
