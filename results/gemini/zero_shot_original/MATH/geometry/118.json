    "solution": "Draw radii to the intersection points of the chord with the circle. An equilateral triangle is formed with area $\\frac{6^2\\sqrt{3}}{4} = 9\\sqrt{3}$. However, the whole section has area $\\frac{36\\pi}{6} = 6\\pi$. If we take the area of the sector away from the area of the entire circle and then add back in the area of the equilateral triangle, we will get the area of the larger region. The area is therefore $36\\pi - 6\\pi + 9\\sqrt{3} = \\boxed{30\\pi + 9\\sqrt{3}}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Visualize the problem:**\nImagine a circle with a radius of 6 units. Draw a chord that divides the circle into two regions.  The chord will create a segment of the circle.\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.5 cm);\npair A, B, O;\nO = (0,0);\nA = dir(120);\nB = dir(240);\ndraw(Circle(O,6));\ndraw(A--B);\nlabel(\"$O$\", O, S);\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, N);\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, S);\n[/asy]\n**2. Find the central angle:**\n* The chord creates an isosceles triangle with the center of the circle (O).\n* The two radii from the center of the circle to the endpoints of the chord are equal to the radius (6 units).\n* Since the chord has length 6 units, the triangle is equilateral.\n* Therefore, the central angle (angle AOB) is 60 degrees.\n**3. Calculate the area of the sector:**\n* The area of the whole circle is $\\pi r^2 = \\pi (6^2) = 36\\pi$ square units.\n* The area of the sector formed by the central angle is a fraction of the whole circle's area:  \n   * (central angle / 360 degrees) * (area of the circle)\n   * (60 degrees / 360 degrees) * (36\u03c0) = 6\u03c0 square units\n**4. Calculate the area of the equilateral triangle:**\n* The area of an equilateral triangle is  (\u221a3 / 4) * (side)^2\n* In this case, the area of triangle AOB is (\u221a3 / 4) * (6)^2 = 9\u221a3 square units.\n**5. Find the area of the smaller region:**\n* The area of the smaller region (the segment) is the difference between the sector's area and the triangle's area:\n   * 6\u03c0 - 9\u221a3 square units\n**6. Find the area of the larger region:**\n* The area of the larger region is the difference between the whole circle's area and the area of the smaller region:\n   * 36\u03c0 - (6\u03c0 - 9\u221a3) = 30\u03c0 + 9\u221a3 square units\n**Therefore, the area of the larger region is  30\u03c0 + 9\u221a3 square units.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Problem**\nImagine a circle with a radius of 6 units. Draw a chord of length 6 units inside the circle. This chord will cut the circle into two segments.  We want to find the area of the larger segment.\n**2. Find the Central Angle**\n* The chord forms an isosceles triangle with two radii of the circle.  \n* Since the chord is the same length as the radius, this triangle is equilateral.\n* All angles in an equilateral triangle are 60 degrees.\n**3. Find the Area of the Sector**\n* The sector formed by the central angle is a fraction of the whole circle.\n* The central angle is 60 degrees, which is 1/6 of the total 360 degrees.\n* The area of the whole circle is $\\pi r^2 = \\pi (6^2) = 36\\pi$.\n* The area of the sector is (1/6) * 36\u03c0 = 6\u03c0 square units.\n**4. Find the Area of the Triangle**\n* The triangle is equilateral with side length 6.\n* The area of an equilateral triangle is $(\\sqrt{3}/4) * side^2$.\n* The area of this triangle is $(\\sqrt{3}/4) * 6^2 = 9\\sqrt{3}$ square units.\n**5. Find the Area of the Larger Segment**\n* The larger segment's area is the area of the sector minus the area of the triangle.\n* Area of larger segment = 6\u03c0 - 9\u221a3  square units.\n**Therefore, the area of the larger region is **6\u03c0 - 9\u221a3** square units.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Situation**\nImagine a circle with a radius of 6 units.  Draw a chord that is 6 units long, which means it's equal in length to the radius. This chord divides the circle into two regions.\n**2.  Identify the Key Geometric Shapes**\n* **The Chord and the Center:**  Since the chord has the same length as the radius, it forms an equilateral triangle with the two radii that connect the endpoints of the chord to the center of the circle. \n* **The Smaller Region:**  The smaller region is a segment of the circle, bounded by the chord and the arc it cuts off.\n* **The Larger Region:** The larger region is the rest of the circle.\n**3. Calculate the Area of the Equilateral Triangle**\n* The area of an equilateral triangle with side length *s* is  (\u221a3/4) * s\u00b2.\n* In our case, *s* = 6, so the area of the triangle is (\u221a3/4) * 6\u00b2 = 9\u221a3 square units.\n**4. Calculate the Area of the Sector**\n* The central angle of the sector is 60\u00b0 (since each angle in an equilateral triangle is 60\u00b0).\n* The area of a sector is (\u03b8/360\u00b0) * \u03c0r\u00b2, where *\u03b8* is the central angle and *r* is the radius.\n* In our case, *\u03b8* = 60\u00b0 and *r* = 6, so the area of the sector is (60/360) * \u03c0 * 6\u00b2 = 6\u03c0 square units.\n**5. Calculate the Area of the Smaller Region (the Segment)**\n* The area of the segment is the area of the sector minus the area of the triangle: 6\u03c0 - 9\u221a3 square units.\n**6. Calculate the Area of the Larger Region**\n* The area of the larger region is the area of the entire circle minus the area of the smaller region. \n* The area of the circle is \u03c0r\u00b2 = \u03c0 * 6\u00b2 = 36\u03c0 square units.\n* Therefore, the area of the larger region is 36\u03c0 - (6\u03c0 - 9\u221a3) = **30\u03c0 + 9\u221a3 square units**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Problem**\nImagine a circle with radius 6.  Draw a chord of length 6 that divides the circle into two regions.  Since the chord is the same length as the radius, it forms an equilateral triangle with two radii.\n**2. Find the Central Angle**\n* The equilateral triangle has three equal angles, each measuring 60 degrees.\n* This 60-degree angle is the central angle of the sector formed by the chord.\n**3. Calculate the Area of the Sector**\n* The area of a sector is given by:  (central angle / 360\u00b0) * (area of the circle)\n* Area of the sector = (60\u00b0/360\u00b0) * (\u03c0 * 6\u00b2) = 6\u03c0 square units\n**4. Calculate the Area of the Triangle**\n* The equilateral triangle has sides of length 6.\n* The area of an equilateral triangle is given by: (\u221a3/4) * side\u00b2\n* Area of the triangle = (\u221a3/4) * 6\u00b2 = 9\u221a3 square units\n**5. Find the Area of the Larger Region**\n* The larger region is the area of the circle minus the area of the triangle.\n* Area of the larger region = (\u03c0 * 6\u00b2) - 9\u221a3 = **36\u03c0 - 9\u221a3 square units** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the problem:**\nImagine a circle with a radius of 6 units. Draw a chord of length 6 units inside the circle. This chord divides the circle into two regions: a smaller region shaped like a segment of the circle, and a larger region that's the rest of the circle.\n**2. Find the central angle of the segment:**\n* The chord is equal in length to the radius of the circle, which means it forms an equilateral triangle with the two radii connecting its endpoints to the center of the circle. \n* Each angle of an equilateral triangle measures 60 degrees.\n**3. Calculate the area of the entire circle:**\n* The area of a circle is given by  \u03c0r\u00b2, where r is the radius.\n* In this case, the area of the entire circle is \u03c0(6)\u00b2 = 36\u03c0 square units.\n**4. Calculate the area of the segment:**\n* The area of the segment is the difference between the area of the sector (the portion of the circle defined by the central angle) and the area of the triangle formed by the chord and the radii.\n* **Area of the sector:** (60/360) * 36\u03c0 = 6\u03c0 square units (since 60 degrees is 1/6 of the full circle).\n* **Area of the triangle:** (1/2) * base * height. The base is 6, and the height can be found using the 30-60-90 triangle formed by dropping a perpendicular from the center of the circle to the chord (the height is \u221a3 times half the base).  So, the height is 3\u221a3, and the area of the triangle is (1/2) * 6 * 3\u221a3 = 9\u221a3 square units.\n* **Area of the segment:** 6\u03c0 - 9\u221a3 square units.\n**5. Find the area of the larger region:**\n* Subtract the area of the segment from the area of the entire circle: 36\u03c0 - (6\u03c0 - 9\u221a3) = **30\u03c0 + 9\u221a3 square units**. \n**Therefore, the area of the larger region is 30\u03c0 + 9\u221a3 square units.** \n"
