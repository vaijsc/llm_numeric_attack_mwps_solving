        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Situation**\nImagine an isosceles right triangle with its right angle at point C. The hypotenuse AB is the line connecting points A and B. \n**2.  Find the Length of the Hypotenuse**\nUse the distance formula to find the length of AB:\n*  AB = \u221a[(5 - (-1))^2 + (-5 - (-1))^2] \n*  AB = \u221a[(6)^2 + (-4)^2]\n*  AB = \u221a(36 + 16)\n*  AB = \u221a52 = 2\u221a13\n**3. Find the Length of the Legs**\nSince it's an isosceles right triangle, the legs have equal lengths.  The length of each leg is the hypotenuse divided by \u221a2:\n*  AC = BC = (AB) / \u221a2 = (2\u221a13) / \u221a2 = \u221a26\n**4. Calculate the Area**\nThe area of a triangle is (1/2) * base * height. In this case:\n* Area of \u0394ABC = (1/2) * AC * BC\n* Area of \u0394ABC = (1/2) * \u221a26 * \u221a26\n* Area of \u0394ABC = **13** \n**Therefore, the area of triangle ABC is 13 square units.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the midpoint of the hypotenuse:**\n* The midpoint of a line segment is found by averaging the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates of the endpoints.\n* Midpoint of AB =  ((5 + (-1))/2, (-5 + (-1))/2) = (2, -3)\n**2. Understand the properties of an isosceles right triangle:**\n* An isosceles right triangle has two equal sides and a right angle.\n* The two equal sides are the legs of the triangle.\n* The hypotenuse is the side opposite the right angle.\n**3. Visualize the situation:**\n* Since the triangle is isosceles right, the midpoint of the hypotenuse is also the center of the square formed by the triangle. \n* The legs of the triangle are the diagonals of this square.\n**4. Calculate the length of a leg:**\n* The length of each leg is equal to half the length of the hypotenuse.\n* Use the distance formula to find the length of the hypotenuse AB:\n   *  AB = \u221a((5 - (-1))^2 + (-5 - (-1))^2) = \u221a(6^2 + (-4)^2) = \u221a52 = 2\u221a13\n* The length of each leg is (2\u221a13) / 2 = \u221a13.\n**5. Calculate the area:**\n* The area of a triangle is (1/2) * base * height.\n* In a right triangle, the legs are the base and height.\n* Area of ABC = (1/2) * \u221a13 * \u221a13 = **6.5** \n**Therefore, the area of triangle ABC is 6.5 square units.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the midpoint of the hypotenuse:**\n* The midpoint of a line segment with endpoints $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is  \n  ((x_1 + x_2)/2, (y_1 + y_2)/2).\n* Applying this to our hypotenuse AB, the midpoint is  \n  ((5 - 1)/2, (-5 - 1)/2) = (2, -3).\n**2. Determine the slope of the hypotenuse:**\n* The slope of a line passing through points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is \n  (y_2 - y_1)/(x_2 - x_1).\n* The slope of AB is (-1 - (-5))/(-1 - 5) = 4/-6 = -2/3.\n**3. Find the slope of the legs:**\n* Since triangle ABC is an isosceles right triangle, the legs are perpendicular to the hypotenuse.\n* The slopes of perpendicular lines are negative reciprocals of each other. \n* Therefore, the slope of each leg is 3/2.\n**4. Find the equation of one of the legs:**\n* We know the midpoint of the hypotenuse (2, -3) lies on one of the legs, and we know the slope of the leg is 3/2.\n* Using the point-slope form of a linear equation (y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)), we get:\n    y - (-3) = (3/2)(x - 2)\n    y + 3 = (3/2)x - 3\n    y = (3/2)x - 6\n**5. Find the intersection points of the leg and the hypotenuse:**\n* We have the equation of the leg (y = (3/2)x - 6) and the coordinates of the endpoints of the hypotenuse (A: (5, -5) and B: (-1, -1)).\n* Substitute the x and y coordinates of A and B into the equation of the leg to see if they satisfy the equation.\n* A: -5 = (3/2)(5) - 6 is not true, so A is not on the leg.\n* B: -1 = (3/2)(-1) - 6 is true, so B is on the leg.\n**6.  Find the other endpoint of the leg:**\n* Since B is on the leg, the other endpoint of the leg must be the intersection of the leg and the hypotenuse.\n* To find this point, we need to find the equation of the hypotenuse. We know the slope (-2/3) and a point on it (A: (5, -5)).\n* Using point-slope form again:\n    y - (-5) = (-2/3)(x - 5)\n    y + 5 = (-2/3)x + 10/3\n    y = (-2/3)x + 5/3\n* Now we have two equations:\n    y = (3/2)x - 6 (equation of the leg)\n    y = (-2/3)x + 5/3 (equation of the hypotenuse)\n* To find the intersection, set the right-hand sides equal to each other:\n    (3/2)x - 6 = (-2/3)x + 5/3\n* Solve for x:\n    (13/6)x = 23/3\n    x = 46/13\n* Substitute this value of x back into either equation to find y. Let's use the leg equation:\n    y = (3/2)(46/13) - 6\n    y = 69/13 - 6\n    y = -15/13\n* Therefore, the other endpoint of the leg is (46/13, -15/13).\n**7. Calculate the length of a leg:**\n* We have the two endpoints of the leg: (-1, -1) and (46/13, -15/13).\n* Use the distance formula to find the length:\n    \u221a[((46/13) - (-1))^2 + (-15/13 - (-1))^2] = \u221a[((59/13))^2 + (-2/13)^2] = \u221a(3481/169) = 59/13.\n**8. Calculate the area of the triangle:**\n* The area of a right triangle is (1/2) * base * height.\n* In this case, the legs are the base and height.\n* Area = (1/2) * (59/13) * (59/13) = 3481/338 \n**Therefore, the area of triangle ABC is 3481/338 square units.** \n",

Let 's' represent the length of a leg:\n2\u221a13 = \u221a2 * s\ns = (2\u221a13) / \u221a2 = \u221a26\n**4.
