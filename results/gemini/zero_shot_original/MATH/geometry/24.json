    "problem": "Danny Henry made a waffle on his six-inch-diameter circular griddle using batter containing a half a cup of flour. Using the same batter, and knowing that all waffles have the same thickness, how many cups of flour would Paul Bunyan need for his 24-foot-diameter circular griddle?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Say Paul and Danny's griddles have diameters $d_1$ and $d_2$, respectively. Paul's griddle has $\\frac{d_1}{d_2}=\\frac{24\\text{ ft}}{.5\\text{ ft}}=48$ times the diameter and therefore $\\frac{\\pi d_1^2/4}{\\pi d_2^2/4}=\\left(\\frac{r_1}{r_2}\\right)^2=48^2=2304$ times the area. It requires $2304$ times as much flour, or $2304\\cdot0.5=\\boxed{1152}$ cups of flour.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the area of Danny's griddle:**\n* Radius of Danny's griddle: 6 inches / 2 = 3 inches\n* Area of Danny's griddle: \u03c0 * (3 inches)\u00b2 = 9\u03c0 square inches\n**2. Find the area of Paul Bunyan's griddle:**\n* Radius of Paul Bunyan's griddle: 24 feet * 12 inches/foot = 288 inches\n* Area of Paul Bunyan's griddle: \u03c0 * (288 inches)\u00b2 = 82,944\u03c0 square inches\n**3. Determine the ratio of the griddle areas:**\n* Ratio of Paul Bunyan's griddle area to Danny's griddle area: (82,944\u03c0 square inches) / (9\u03c0 square inches) = 9216\n**4. Calculate the flour needed for Paul Bunyan's waffle:**\n* Since the waffle thickness is the same, the amount of flour needed is directly proportional to the area of the griddle. \n* Flour needed for Paul Bunyan's waffle: 0.5 cups * 9216 = **4608 cups of flour** \n**Therefore, Paul Bunyan would need 4608 cups of flour for his waffle.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the area of Danny's griddle:**\n* The radius of Danny's griddle is half the diameter, so it's 6 inches / 2 = 3 inches.\n* The area of a circle is \u03c0r\u00b2, where r is the radius.  \n* Area of Danny's griddle: \u03c0 * (3 inches)\u00b2 = 9\u03c0 square inches\n**2. Find the area of Paul Bunyan's griddle:**\n* First, convert the diameter to inches: 24 feet * 12 inches/foot = 288 inches.\n* The radius of Paul Bunyan's griddle is 288 inches / 2 = 144 inches.\n* Area of Paul Bunyan's griddle: \u03c0 * (144 inches)\u00b2 = 20736\u03c0 square inches\n**3. Determine the ratio of the griddle areas:**\n* The ratio of Paul Bunyan's griddle area to Danny's griddle area is (20736\u03c0 square inches) / (9\u03c0 square inches) = 2304.\n**4. Calculate the flour needed for Paul Bunyan's waffle:**\n* Since the waffles have the same thickness, the amount of flour needed is directly proportional to the area of the griddle.\n* Paul Bunyan needs 2304 times more flour than Danny.\n* Paul Bunyan needs 2304 * 0.5 cups of flour = 1152 cups of flour.\n**Answer:** Paul Bunyan would need **1152 cups** of flour for his waffle. \n",
