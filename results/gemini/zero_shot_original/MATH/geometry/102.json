    "solution": "Let $x$ denote the measure of each of the two equal sides.  Then the remaining side has measure $20-2x$ units.  By the triangle inequality, the third side must be shorter than the two equal sides combined.  In other words, $x+x>20-2x$.  Solving this inequality, we find $x>5$.  Also, the third side length has to be positive, so $20-2x>0$ which implies $x<10$.  Therefore, the $\\boxed{4}$ integers strictly between 5 and 10 are the possible integer values of $x$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand Isosceles Triangles**\nAn isosceles triangle has two sides of equal length.  Let's call the length of these two equal sides 'x'.  The third side (the base) will have a different length.\n**2. Use the Perimeter Information**\nThe perimeter is the sum of all the side lengths. We know the perimeter is 20 units.  This gives us the equation:\nx + x + base = 20\n**3. Simplify the Equation**\nCombine the 'x' terms:\n2x + base = 20\n**4.  Find Possible Base Lengths**\nWe need to find whole-number values for 'x' and the base that satisfy this equation.  Since 'x' and the base are lengths, they must be positive whole numbers.  \n* **Start with the smallest possible value for 'x':**  If x = 1, then the base would have to be 18. \n* **Increase 'x' and see if you can find other solutions:** If x = 2, the base would have to be 16. \n* **Continue this process:**  You'll find that you can keep increasing 'x' and find corresponding base lengths.\n**5. List the Solutions**\nHere are all the possible isosceles triangles with a perimeter of 20 units:\n* x = 1, base = 18\n* x = 2, base = 16\n* x = 3, base = 14\n* x = 4, base = 12\n* x = 5, base = 10\n* x = 6, base = 8\n* x = 7, base = 6\n* x = 8, base = 4\n* x = 9, base = 2\n**6. The Answer**\nThere are **9** isosceles triangles with whole-number length sides that have a perimeter of 20 units. \n",

Here's a systematic approach:\n1. **Start with the largest possible value for *x*:** Since the two equal sides are the longest, let's try *x* = 9.\n   *  2(9) + y = 20\n   *  y = 2  (This works!)\n2. **Decrease *x* and see if we get valid values for *y*:**\n   *  *x* = 8: 2(8) + y = 20, y = 4 (Works!)\n   *  *x* = 7: 2(7) + y = 20, y = 6 (Works!)\n   *  *x* = 6: 2(6) + y = 20, y = 8 (Works!)\n**The Triangle Inequality**\n* Remember that the sum of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side.  We need to make sure our solutions meet this rule.  All the solutions above satisfy the Triangle Inequality.\n**The Answer**\nWe found four possible isosceles triangles with a perimeter of 20 units:\n*  (9, 9, 2)\n*  (8, 8, 4)\n*  (7, 7, 6)\n*  (6, 6, 8)\n**Therefore, there are 4 isosceles triangles with whole-number length sides and a perimeter of 20 units.** \n",
