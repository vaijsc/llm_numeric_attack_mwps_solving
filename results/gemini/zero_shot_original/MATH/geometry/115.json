    "solution": "Connecting the midpoints of the sides of a square in order forms a square that has half the area of the original square.  So, the square formed by connecting the midpoints of $ABCD$ has area $\\frac12\\cdot 4^2 = 8$ square inches.  The smallest square in the diagram is formed by connecting the midpoints of this square with area 8, so the smallest square has area $\\frac12 \\cdot 8 =4$ square inches, leaving $8-4=\\boxed{4}$ square inches of shaded area.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the side length of the inner square:**\n* Each side of the inner square is the diagonal of a smaller square formed by half of the original square's side.\n*  The smaller square has a side length of 2 inches.\n*  Using the Pythagorean theorem, the diagonal (and side of the inner square) is \u221a(2\u00b2 + 2\u00b2) = \u221a8 = 2\u221a2 inches.\n**2. Find the area of the inner square:**\n* The area of a square is side length squared.\n* Area of the inner square = (2\u221a2)\u00b2 = 8 square inches.\n**3. Find the area of the outer square:**\n* Area of the outer square = side length squared = 4\u00b2 = 16 square inches.\n**4. Find the area of one of the shaded triangles:**\n* Each shaded triangle is a right triangle with legs of 2\u221a2 inches. \n* Area of a triangle = (1/2) * base * height\n* Area of one shaded triangle = (1/2) * (2\u221a2) * (2\u221a2) = 4 square inches.\n**5. Find the total shaded area:**\n* There are four shaded triangles.\n* Total shaded area = 4 triangles * 4 square inches/triangle = 16 square inches.\n**6. Find the area of the unshaded region:**\n* Area of the unshaded region = Area of the outer square - Area of the inner square - Area of the shaded region.\n* Area of the unshaded region = 16 - 8 - 16 = -8 square inches.\n**Since we cannot have a negative area, this indicates we made an error in our calculations. Let's go back and check our work.**\n**Error:** We incorrectly calculated the area of the shaded region. The shaded region is **not** four triangles but rather **four trapezoids**. \n**7.  Find the area of one shaded trapezoid:**\n*  Area of a trapezoid = (1/2) * (sum of bases) * height\n*  One trapezoid has bases of 4 inches and 2\u221a2 inches, and a height of 2 inches.\n*  Area of one trapezoid = (1/2) * (4 + 2\u221a2) * 2 = 4 + 2\u221a2 square inches.\n**8.  Find the total shaded area:**\n*  Total shaded area = 4 trapezoids * (4 + 2\u221a2) square inches/trapezoid = 16 + 8\u221a2 square inches.\n**9.  Final answer:**\n*  The area of the shaded region is **16 + 8\u221a2 square inches**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Find the side length of the smaller square:**\n* The smaller square is formed by connecting the midpoints of the larger square. This creates a right triangle where the hypotenuse is the side of the smaller square and the legs are half the side of the larger square.\n* Using the Pythagorean theorem:  (side of smaller square)\u00b2 = (1/2 * 4)\u00b2 + (1/2 * 4)\u00b2 = 4 + 4 = 8\n* Therefore, the side of the smaller square is \u221a8 = 2\u221a2 inches.\n**2. Calculate the area of the smaller square:**\n* Area of the smaller square = (side)\u00b2 = (2\u221a2)\u00b2 = 8 square inches\n**3. Calculate the area of the larger square:**\n* Area of the larger square = (side)\u00b2 = 4\u00b2 = 16 square inches\n**4. Find the area of the unshaded region:**\n* Area of the unshaded region = Area of the larger square - Area of the smaller square = 16 - 8 = 8 square inches\n**5. Find the area of the shaded region:**\n*  The shaded region is made up of four congruent triangles.\n*  The area of one triangle = (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 2 * 2 = 2 square inches.\n*  The total area of the shaded region = 4 * 2 = 8 square inches.\n**Answer:** The area of the shaded region is **8 square inches**. \n",

Subtract the shaded area from the area of the outer square to find the area of the unshaded region:**\n* Area of unshaded region = Area of outer square - Area of shaded region\n* Area of unshaded region = 16 - 8 = 8 square inches.\n**Therefore, the area of the shaded region is 8 square inches.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the side length of the smaller squares:**\n*  Since the smaller squares are formed by connecting midpoints, their sides are half the length of the larger square's sides. \n*  The side length of the smaller squares is 4 inches / 2 = 2 inches.\n**2. Find the area of one smaller square:**\n* The area of a square is side length squared.\n* The area of one smaller square is 2 inches * 2 inches = 4 square inches.\n**3. Find the area of the entire large square:**\n* The area of the large square is 4 inches * 4 inches = 16 square inches.\n**4. Find the area of the unshaded region:**\n* The unshaded region consists of the four smaller squares.\n* The total area of the unshaded region is 4 squares * 4 square inches/square = 16 square inches.\n**5. Find the area of the shaded region:**\n* The area of the shaded region is the area of the large square minus the area of the unshaded region.\n* The area of the shaded region is 16 square inches - 16 square inches = **0 square inches**.\n**Therefore, the area of the shaded region is 0 square inches.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the side length of the smaller squares:**\n*  Each smaller square is formed by connecting the midpoints of the sides of the larger square. This means the diagonal of each smaller square is equal to the side of the larger square (4 inches).\n* Since the diagonal of a square is \u221a2 times the side length, the side length of each smaller square is 4/\u221a2 = 2\u221a2 inches.\n**2. Find the area of one smaller square:**\n* Area of a square = side length\u00b2\n* Area of one smaller square = (2\u221a2)\u00b2 = 8 square inches.\n**3. Find the total area of the four smaller squares:**\n* Total area = 4 * (area of one smaller square)\n* Total area = 4 * 8 = 32 square inches\n**4. Find the area of the large square:**\n* Area of large square = side length\u00b2 \n* Area of large square = 4\u00b2 = 16 square inches\n**5. Find the area of the shaded region:**\n* Shaded area = Area of large square - Total area of smaller squares\n* Shaded area = 16 - 32 = -16 square inches\n**Important Note:** The shaded area cannot be negative. This indicates there's an error in our calculation. The issue is we're subtracting the area of the four smaller squares from the area of the larger square, but we should only subtract the area of the shaded region within the larger square. \n**Correct Approach:**\n* The shaded region is made up of four congruent triangles. \n* Each triangle has a base of 2\u221a2 inches (side of smaller square) and a height of 2 inches (half the side of the larger square).\n* Area of one triangle = (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 2\u221a2 * 2 = 2\u221a2 square inches.\n* Area of the shaded region = 4 * (area of one triangle) = 4 * 2\u221a2 = **8\u221a2 square inches**. \n"
