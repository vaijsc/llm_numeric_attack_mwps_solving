        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the properties:**\n* **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** An inscribed angle's measure is half the measure of its intercepted arc.\n* **Central Angle Theorem:** A central angle's measure is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.\n* **Angles in a Hexagon:** The sum of the interior angles of a hexagon is 720 degrees.\n**2. Apply the properties:**\n* **Find the measure of arc EF:** Since angle FPO is 105 degrees, arc EF is twice that, or 210 degrees.\n* **Find the measure of arc AB:** Since angle BPO is 110 degrees, arc AB is twice that, or 220 degrees.\n* **Find the measure of arc BCDE:**  The sum of the angles in hexagon ABCDEF is 720 degrees.  Therefore, angle BCD = 720 - 105 - 110 - alpha - 180 - 180 = 325 - alpha.\n* **Find the measure of arc BCDE:**  Since angle BCDE is 325 - alpha degrees, arc BCDE is twice that, or 650 - 2*alpha degrees.\n* **Find the measure of the entire circle:** The entire circle is 360 degrees.  We know that the sum of the measures of the arcs in the circle must equal 360 degrees.  Therefore:  210 + 220 + 650 - 2*alpha = 360.\n**3. Solve for alpha:**\n* **Simplify the equation:** 1080 - 2*alpha = 360\n* **Solve for alpha:** 2*alpha = 720, so alpha = 360 degrees.\n**Therefore, the measure of alpha is 360 degrees.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve for the measure of \u03b1:\n**1. Angles in a Hexagon**\n* The sum of the interior angles of a hexagon is (6-2) * 180 = 720 degrees.\n**2. Finding Missing Angles**\n*  Let's call the missing angle at vertex A \"x\" and the missing angle at vertex C \"y\". \n*  We know two angles are 105\u00b0 and 110\u00b0, so: x + y + 105\u00b0 + 110\u00b0 + \u03b1 + 180\u00b0 = 720\u00b0\n*  Simplifying, we get: x + y + \u03b1 = 325\u00b0\n**3. Central Angles**\n*  Each side of the hexagon subtends a central angle of 360\u00b0/6 = 60\u00b0.\n*  Therefore, angle POA = angle POC = 60\u00b0.\n**4. Using Triangle Properties**\n*  Consider triangle POA.  The sum of its angles is 180\u00b0, so x + 60\u00b0 + 180\u00b0 - 105\u00b0 = 180\u00b0.\n*  Solving for x, we find x = 105\u00b0.\n*  Similarly, consider triangle POC.  The sum of its angles is 180\u00b0, so y + 60\u00b0 + 180\u00b0 - 110\u00b0 = 180\u00b0.\n*  Solving for y, we find y = 70\u00b0.\n**5. Solving for \u03b1**\n*  Substitute the values of x and y back into the equation from step 2: 105\u00b0 + 70\u00b0 + \u03b1 = 325\u00b0\n*  Solving for \u03b1, we get \u03b1 = **150\u00b0**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Geometry**\n* **Inscribed Angle Theorem:**  An inscribed angle's measure is half the measure of its intercepted arc.\n* **Central Angle Theorem:** A central angle's measure is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.\n**2.  Find the Missing Angles**\n* **Angle at F:** Since the angles of a hexagon add up to 720 degrees, and we know two angles, we can find the angle at F:  720 - 105 - 110 = 505 degrees.\n* **Arc FP:**  The inscribed angle at F (105 degrees) intercepts arc FP, so arc FP measures 2 * 105 = 210 degrees. \n* **Arc PB:**  The inscribed angle at B (110 degrees) intercepts arc PB, so arc PB measures 2 * 110 = 220 degrees.\n* **Arc PFPB:** The entire arc PFPB measures 210 + 220 = 430 degrees.\n**3.  Find the Central Angle**\n* **Central Angle POD:**  The central angle POD intercepts the same arc as the inscribed angle \u03b1 (arc PFPB), which measures 430 degrees.  Therefore, angle POD measures 430 degrees.\n**4. Solve for \u03b1**\n* **Angle Sum in a Triangle:**  The angles in triangle POD add up to 180 degrees.  We know angle POD is 430 degrees (and therefore, 430 - 360 = 70 degrees).  Since the central angle is equal to the sum of the two remote interior angles, we have: \u03b1 + 70 = 180.\n* **Solve for \u03b1:**  Subtracting 70 from both sides, we find \u03b1 = 110 degrees.\n**Answer:** The measure of \u03b1 is **110 degrees**. \n",

Finding Missing Angles**\n* **Angle at A:**  Since the hexagon is inscribed in a circle, we can use the Inscribed Angle Theorem.  The angle at A intercepts the same arc as the 105-degree angle, so it also measures 105 degrees.\n* **Angle at F:** The angle at F intercepts the same arc as the 110-degree angle, so it also measures 110 degrees.\n* **Angle at C:** The sum of the angles in hexagon ABCDEF is 720 degrees.  We have: 105\u00b0 + 110\u00b0 + 110\u00b0 + \u03b1 + 105\u00b0 + \u03b1 = 720\u00b0.  Simplifying, we get 430\u00b0 + 2\u03b1 = 720\u00b0, so \u03b1 = 145\u00b0.\n**3.  Finding Alpha**\n* **Intercepted Arc:** Since angle \u03b1 is inscribed in the circle, its intercepted arc is twice its measure: 145\u00b0 * 2 = 290\u00b0.\n* **Angle at O:** The central angle at O intercepts the same arc as \u03b1, so it also measures 290\u00b0.\n* **\u03b1 and Central Angle:**  The sum of the angles at O is 360 degrees.  We have: 290\u00b0 + \u03b1 = 360\u00b0.  Solving for \u03b1, we get \u03b1 = 70\u00b0.\n**Therefore, the measure of \u03b1 is 70 degrees.** \n",

Central Angles and Inscribed Angles**\n* **Central Angle:** An angle whose vertex is at the center of the circle.\n* **Inscribed Angle:** An angle whose vertex lies on the circle.\n**Key Relationship:**  The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its corresponding central angle.\n**2. Applying the Relationship**\n* **Angle at B:** Angle $B$ is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc $FD$.\n* **Central Angle at O:** The central angle at $O$ that intercepts arc $FD$ is $\\angle FOB$.\nSince the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its corresponding central angle, we have:\n \n  * $\\angle FOB = 2 \\angle B = 2(110^\\circ) = 220^\\circ$\n**3.
