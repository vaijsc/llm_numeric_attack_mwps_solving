        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Use the Angle Bisector Theorem:**\nThe Angle Bisector Theorem states that the angle bisector of a triangle divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the lengths of the other two sides.  In our triangle, this means:\n*  $\\frac{BD}{DC} = \\frac{AB}{AC} = \\frac{13}{15}$\n**2.  Find BD and DC:**\nLet $BD = 13x$ and $DC = 15x$. Since $BD + DC = BC = 14$, we have:\n*  $13x + 15x = 14$\n*  $28x = 14$\n*  $x = \\frac{1}{2}$\nTherefore, $BD = 13x = \\frac{13}{2}$ and $DC = 15x = \\frac{15}{2}$.\n**3.  Find the Area of Triangle ABC:**\nWe can use Heron's formula to find the area of triangle ABC:\n*  $s = \\frac{13 + 14 + 15}{2} = 21$ (where 's' is the semi-perimeter)\n*  Area of $\\triangle ABC = \\sqrt{s(s-AB)(s-BC)(s-CA)}$\n*  Area of $\\triangle ABC = \\sqrt{21(21-13)(21-14)(21-15)} = \\sqrt{21 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6} = 84$\n**4. Find the Area of Triangle ADC:**\nSince AD is an angle bisector, it divides triangle ABC into two similar triangles, $\\triangle ABD$ and $\\triangle ACD$.  The ratio of their areas is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides:\n*  $\\frac{[\\triangle ADC]}{[\\triangle ABC]} = \\left(\\frac{DC}{BC}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{15/2}{14}\\right)^2 = \\frac{225}{784}$\nTherefore, the area of triangle ADC is:\n*  $[\\triangle ADC] = \\frac{225}{784} \\cdot [\\triangle ABC] = \\frac{225}{784} \\cdot 84 = \\boxed{\\frac{225}{9.8}} \\approx 22.96$ \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Angle Bisector Theorem:**\n* Since AD bisects \u2220A, we can use the Angle Bisector Theorem.  This theorem states that the ratio of the lengths of the two segments that a bisector divides a side into is equal to the ratio of the lengths of the other two sides of the triangle. \n* Let BD = x and DC = 14 - x. Applying the Angle Bisector Theorem:\n   *  BD/DC = AB/AC \n   *  x / (14 - x) = 13/15\n**2. Solve for x:**\n* Cross-multiply: 15x = 182 - 13x\n* Combine like terms: 28x = 182\n* Solve for x: x = 182/28 = 13/2\n**3. Find the Area of Triangle ADC:**\n* **Find the height:**  We need to find the height of triangle ADC (the perpendicular from A to line BC). Let's call this height h. \n* **Use Heron's Formula to find the area of triangle ABC:**\n    * s = (13 + 14 + 15) / 2 = 21 (semi-perimeter)\n    * Area of \u0394ABC = \u221a(21 * (21-13) * (21-14) * (21-15)) = \u221a(21 * 8 * 7 * 6) = 84\n* **Area of a triangle:**  Area = (1/2) * base * height\n* **Relationship between areas:**  The ratio of the areas of two triangles with the same height is equal to the ratio of their bases.  Therefore, the ratio of the area of \u0394ADC to the area of \u0394ABC is DC/BC:\n    * (Area of \u0394ADC) / (Area of \u0394ABC) = DC/BC = (14 - 13/2) / 14 = 1/2 \n* **Calculate the area of \u0394ADC:** \n    * Area of \u0394ADC = (1/2) * (Area of \u0394ABC) = (1/2) * 84 = **42**\n**Therefore, the area of triangle ADC is 42 square units.** \n",

Use the Angle Bisector Theorem:**\n* The Angle Bisector Theorem states that the angle bisector of a triangle divides the opposite side in the ratio of the other two sides.  \n* In our case, since $AD$ bisects $\\angle A$, we have:  \n  * $BD/DC = AB/AC = 13/15$\n**2.

Heron's formula states that the area of a triangle with sides of length $a$, $b$, and $c$ is given by: \n   *  $Area = \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}$, where $s = (a + b + c)/2$ is the semi-perimeter.\n* In triangle $ADC$, we have: \n  * $a = AD$ (we need to find this)\n  * $b = DC = 7.5$\n  * $c = AC = 15$\n**4. Find the Length of AD:**\n* To find $AD$, we can use the Law of Cosines on triangle $ABD$:\n   * $AD^2 = AB^2 + BD^2 - 2(AB)(BD)\\cos(\\angle ABD)$ \n* We need to find $\\cos(\\angle ABD)$.  Since $\\angle BAD = \\angle CAD$, we can use the Law of Cosines on triangle $ACD$ to find $\\cos(\\angle CAD)$:\n   * $AC^2 = AD^2 + CD^2 - 2(AD)(CD)\\cos(\\angle CAD)$\n* Since $\\angle BAD = \\angle CAD$, we have $\\cos(\\angle ABD) = \\cos(\\angle CAD)$.  Now we have two equations with two unknowns (AD and $\\cos(\\angle ABD)$), which we can solve.\n**5. Solve for AD and Area of Triangle ADC:**\n* Solve the system of equations from step 4 to find the value of $AD$.\n* Once you have the value of $AD$, plug it into Heron's formula (from step 3) to calculate the area of triangle $ADC$. \n**Note:** The calculations involved in finding $AD$ and the area of triangle $ADC$ are a bit complex, but the process itself is straightforward. You'll need to use algebraic manipulation and possibly the quadratic formula to solve for $AD$. \n",
