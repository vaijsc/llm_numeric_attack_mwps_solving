    "solution": "A circular sheet of paper with radius 6 inches has a circumference of $2\\pi r = 2 \\pi (6) = 12\\pi$ inches. Since this sheet of paper is cut into 3 equal sectors, each sector must have an arc length of $1/3$ that of the original circle, so each sector has an arc length of $4\\pi$ inches. Because of the way that a cone is formed, the original radius of the circle now becomes the slant height of the cone and the arc length becomes the perimeter of the cone's base. If we let the radius of the cone base be $R$, then we know that the circumference $4\\pi$ must equal $2\\pi R$, so $2 \\pi R = 4 \\pi$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $2\\pi$, we get that the radius of the cone base is $2$ inches.\n\nWe then notice that the radius of the base, the altitude of the cone, and the slant height of the cone form a right triangle where the slant height is the hypotenuse. Since we know both the radius and the slant height, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the height $h$ of the cone. We have that $2^2 + h^2 = 6^2$, so $h^2=32$. Taking the square root of both sides, we have that $h=\\sqrt{32}=\\boxed{4\\sqrt{2}}$ inches.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the circumference of the original circle:**\n* Circumference = 2 * pi * radius = 2 * pi * 6 inches = 12pi inches\n**2. Find the arc length of each sector:**\n* Since the circle is cut into 3 equal sectors, each sector has an arc length of (1/3) * 12pi inches = 4pi inches. \n**3. The arc length of the sector becomes the circumference of the cone's base:**\n* Let the radius of the cone's base be 'r'.  The circumference of the cone's base is 2 * pi * r = 4pi inches.\n* Solving for 'r', we get r = 2 inches.\n**4. Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the height of the cone:**\n* The slant height of the cone is the radius of the original circle (6 inches).\n*  Let the height of the cone be 'h'.  \n* We have a right triangle where:\n    *  Slant height (hypotenuse) = 6 inches\n    *  Base radius = 2 inches\n    *  Height = h\n* Using the Pythagorean theorem:  h\u00b2 + 2\u00b2 = 6\u00b2 \n* Simplifying: h\u00b2 + 4 = 36\n* Solving for 'h': h\u00b2 = 32 \n*  h = \u221a32 = 4\u221a2 inches\n**Therefore, the height of the cone is 4\u221a2 inches.** \n",

Find the arc length of each sector:**\n* Each sector is 1/3 of the circle, so the arc length is 1/3 of the circumference.\n* Arc length = (1/3) * 12pi inches = 4pi inches\n**3. Understand the relationship between the arc length and the circumference of the cone's base:**\n* When you form the cone, the arc length of the sector becomes the circumference of the cone's base.\n**4.

Visualize the cone:**\n* Imagine the cone. The radius of the base (2 inches) and the slant height (6 inches, the original radius of the circle) form the hypotenuse and one leg of a right triangle. The height of the cone is the other leg of this triangle.\n**6.

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the circumference of the circle:**\n* The circumference of a circle is given by the formula C = 2\u03c0r, where r is the radius.\n* C = 2 * \u03c0 * 6 inches = 12\u03c0 inches\n**2. Find the arc length of each sector:**\n* Since the circle is divided into 3 equal sectors, each sector's arc length is one-third of the total circumference.\n* Arc length = (1/3) * 12\u03c0 inches = 4\u03c0 inches\n**3. Understand the relationship between the arc length and the cone's circumference:**\n* When you roll a sector into a cone, the arc length of the sector becomes the circumference of the cone's base.\n**4. Find the radius of the cone's base:**\n* The circumference of a circle is given by C = 2\u03c0r, where r is the radius.\n* 4\u03c0 inches = 2\u03c0 * r\n* r = 2 inches\n**5. Visualize the cone:**\n* Imagine the cone. The radius of the cone's base (2 inches) is the same as the distance from the center of the sector to the edge (which is the radius of the original circle).\n* The height of the cone is the perpendicular distance from the tip of the cone to the center of the base. This forms a right triangle with the height, the radius of the base, and the slant height (which is the radius of the original circle).\n**6. Use the Pythagorean theorem:**\n* We know the slant height (6 inches) and the radius of the base (2 inches). We need to find the height.\n* Using the Pythagorean theorem:  height\u00b2 + 2\u00b2 = 6\u00b2\n* height\u00b2 = 32\n* height = \u221a32 = 4\u221a2 inches\n**Therefore, the height of the cone is 4\u221a2 inches.** \n",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Understanding the Cuts**\n* Cutting a circle into 3 equal sectors means each sector will have a central angle of 360 degrees / 3 = 120 degrees.\n**2.  Forming the Cone**\n* When you roll up a sector to make a cone, the arc length of the sector becomes the circumference of the cone's base.\n* The radius of the sector becomes the slant height of the cone.\n**3. Finding the Circumference of the Cone's Base**\n* The arc length of a sector is (central angle / 360 degrees) * (2 * pi * radius of the circle).\n* So, the circumference of the cone's base is (120 degrees / 360 degrees) * (2 * pi * 6 inches) = 4 * pi inches.\n**4. Finding the Radius of the Cone's Base**\n* Circumference of a circle = 2 * pi * radius \n* Therefore, the radius of the cone's base is (4 * pi inches) / (2 * pi) = 2 inches.\n**5. Using the Pythagorean Theorem**\n* We have a right triangle formed by the height of the cone, the radius of the cone's base, and the slant height (which is the radius of the original circle).\n* Applying the Pythagorean Theorem:  height^2 + radius^2 = slant height^2\n* So, height^2 + 2^2 = 6^2\n* Simplifying: height^2 = 32\n**6. Finding the Height**\n* Taking the square root of both sides: height = sqrt(32) = 4 * sqrt(2) inches\n**Therefore, the height of the cone is 4\u221a2 inches.** \n"
