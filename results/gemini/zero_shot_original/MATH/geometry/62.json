    "solution": "Using the volume formula $lwh = V$, the volume of water in the aquarium is $100 \\times 40 \\times 37 = 148{,}000\n\\text{ cm}^3$. When the rock is put in, the water and the rock will occupy a box-shaped region with volume $148{,}000 + 1000 = 149{,}000\n\\text{ cm}^3$. The volume of the water and the rock is $100 \\times 40\n\\times h$, where $h$ is the new height of the water. $\\text{The new\nvolume} = 4000h = 149{,}000 \\text{ cm}^3$, so the new height is $$h=\\frac{149000}{4000}=37.25 \\text{ cm}.$$After adding the rock, the water rises $37.25-37=\\boxed{0.25\\text{ cm}}$.\n\n\\[ OR \\]Because the shape of the rock is irrelevant, we may assume that the rock is shaped like a rectangular box with base measuring $100\n\\text{ cm} \\times 40 \\text{ cm}$ and height $h$ cm. Using the volume formula, $100 \\times 40 \\times h =1000$, so $h =\n\\frac{1000}{100\\times 40}=0.25 \\text{ cm}$. When the rock is put into the aquarium, the water level will rise by $\\boxed{0.25\\,\\text{ cm}}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Calculate the initial volume of water:**\n* The base area of the aquarium is 100 cm * 40 cm = 4000 cm\u00b2\n* The initial volume of water is 4000 cm\u00b2 * 37 cm = 148000 cm\u00b3\n**2. Calculate the volume of water displaced by the rock:**\n* The rock's volume is 1000 cm\u00b3 \n**3. Calculate the total volume of water after the rock is added:**\n* The total volume of water is 148000 cm\u00b3 + 1000 cm\u00b3 = 149000 cm\u00b3\n**4. Calculate the new height of the water:**\n* The new height is (149000 cm\u00b3) / (4000 cm\u00b2) = 37.25 cm\n**5. Determine the change in water level:**\n* The water level rose by 37.25 cm - 37 cm = 0.25 cm\n**Answer:** The water level rises by **0.25** cm. \n",

Calculate the volume of water displaced by the rock:**\n* The rock's volume is 1000 cm\u00b3.  Since it's completely submerged, it displaces an equal volume of water.\n**3. Calculate the new total volume of water:**\n* The new total volume of water is 148000 cm\u00b3 + 1000 cm\u00b3 = 149000 cm\u00b3.\n**4. Calculate the new height of the water:**\n* The new height of the water is (149000 cm\u00b3) / (4000 cm\u00b2) = 37.25 cm.\n**5.
