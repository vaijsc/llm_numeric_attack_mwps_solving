        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Geometry**\n* **Equilateral Triangle:** The trefoil is formed by overlapping circular sectors centered at the vertices of an equilateral triangle.\n* **Base Length:** The base of the equilateral triangle is 2, meaning each side has length 2.\n* **Radius of Sectors:** The radius of each circular sector is equal to the side length of the triangle, which is 2.\n**2. Calculate the Area of the Triangle**\n* **Formula:** The area of an equilateral triangle with side 's' is (\u221a3/4) * s\u00b2\n* **Substitute:** In this case, s = 2, so the area of the triangle is (\u221a3/4) * 2\u00b2 = \u221a3.\n**3. Calculate the Area of a Single Sector**\n* **Central Angle:** Each sector of the circle has a central angle of 60 degrees (1/6 of a full circle) because each vertex of the triangle forms a 60-degree angle.\n* **Formula:** The area of a sector with central angle '\u03b8' (in degrees) and radius 'r' is (\u03b8/360) * \u03c0r\u00b2\n* **Substitute:** In this case, \u03b8 = 60 and r = 2, so the area of one sector is (60/360) * \u03c0 * 2\u00b2 = (1/6) * 4\u03c0 = (2/3)\u03c0\n**4. Calculate the Area of the Trefoil**\n* **Overlapping:** Notice that the trefoil consists of six sectors, but the overlapping portions of these sectors are counted multiple times. \n* **Subtract Overlap:**  We need to subtract the area of the triangle (which is counted 3 times in the 6 sectors) to avoid counting the overlap.\n* **Calculation:** The area of the trefoil is (6 * Area of one sector) - (2 * Area of the triangle) \n* **Substitute:**  (6 * (2/3)\u03c0) - (2 * \u221a3) = 4\u03c0 - 2\u221a3\n**Answer:** The area of the trefoil is **4\u03c0 - 2\u221a3**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Figure**\n* The trefoil is made up of three identical circular sectors.\n* Each sector is part of a circle whose radius is the side length of the equilateral triangle.\n* The base of the trefoil is the same length as the base of one equilateral triangle.\n**2. Find the Side Length of the Triangle**\n* Since the base of the trefoil is 2, the base of the equilateral triangle is also 2.\n*  In an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal.  Therefore, the side length of the triangle is 2.\n**3. Find the Area of the Entire Triangle**\n* The area of an equilateral triangle is (\u221a3/4) * side\u00b2 \n* So, the area of the equilateral triangle is (\u221a3/4) * 2\u00b2 = \u221a3 \n**4. Find the Central Angle of Each Sector**\n*  Each sector of the trefoil takes up 1/3 of the equilateral triangle's total angle.\n*  A triangle has 180 degrees, so each sector's central angle is 180/3 = 60 degrees.\n**5. Find the Area of Each Sector**\n* The area of a sector is (\u03b8/360) * \u03c0r\u00b2 where \u03b8 is the central angle and r is the radius.\n*  The radius of each sector is the side length of the triangle, which is 2.\n*  The area of each sector is (60/360) * \u03c0(2)\u00b2 = (1/6) * 4\u03c0 = (2/3)\u03c0\n**6. Find the Area of the Trefoil**\n* The trefoil is made up of three identical sectors.\n*  The area of the trefoil is 3 * (2/3)\u03c0 = 2\u03c0\n**Answer:** The area of the trefoil is **2\u03c0**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step by step:\n**1. Understand the Geometry**\n* **Equilateral Triangle:**  The trefoil is built from three congruent equilateral triangles. Since the base of the trefoil is 2, each side of the equilateral triangle has length 2.\n* **Circular Sectors:** The trefoil is formed by drawing circular sectors with radius 2 (the side of the equilateral triangle) centered at each vertex of the triangle.\n**2. Calculate the Area of One Sector**\n* **Angle of the Sector:**  Each sector covers 1/6th of the circle (360 degrees / 6 = 60 degrees). This is because the angle of each corner of an equilateral triangle is 60 degrees.\n* **Area of a Sector:** The area of a sector is given by  (\u03b8/360\u00b0) * \u03c0r\u00b2, where \u03b8 is the central angle and r is the radius.\n* **Area of One Sector:**  (60/360) * \u03c0 * 2\u00b2 = (1/6) * 4\u03c0 = (2/3)\u03c0\n**3. Calculate the Area of the Trefoil**\n* **Three Sectors:** The trefoil is made up of three of these sectors.\n* **Total Area:**  3 * (2/3)\u03c0 = 2\u03c0\n**Therefore, the area of the trefoil is 2\u03c0 square units.** \n",

Since the base of the trefoil is 2, each side of the equilateral triangle has length 2.\n* **Circular Sectors:** Each \"leaf\" of the trefoil is a circular sector. The radius of each sector is the side length of the equilateral triangle (2). The central angle of each sector is 60 degrees (since the angles of an equilateral triangle are all 60 degrees).\n**2. Calculate the Area of One Sector**\n* **Area of a sector:** The area of a sector is (1/2) * r\u00b2 * \u03b8, where 'r' is the radius and '\u03b8' is the central angle in radians.\n* **Convert to Radians:** 60 degrees * (\u03c0 radians / 180 degrees) = \u03c0/3 radians\n* **Area of one sector:** (1/2) * 2\u00b2 * (\u03c0/3) = (2\u03c0/3) square units\n**3. Calculate the Area of the Trefoil**\n* **Three Sectors:** The trefoil is made of three identical sectors.\n* **Total Area:** 3 * (2\u03c0/3) = **2\u03c0 square units**\n**Therefore, the area of the trefoil is 2\u03c0 square units.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the side length of the equilateral triangles:**\n* The base of the trefoil is 2, and it's formed by two sides of the equilateral triangles.\n* Therefore, each side of the equilateral triangles has length 1.\n**2. Find the area of one equilateral triangle:**\n* The area of an equilateral triangle with side length *s* is given by:  Area = (\u221a3 / 4) * s\u00b2\n* In this case, the area of one equilateral triangle is:  Area = (\u221a3 / 4) * 1\u00b2 = \u221a3 / 4\n**3. Find the area of one circular sector:**\n* Each circular sector is 1/6 of a circle (60 degrees out of 360 degrees).\n* The radius of the circle is the side length of the triangle, which is 1.\n* The area of a circle with radius *r* is given by: Area = \u03c0 * r\u00b2\n* The area of one circular sector is: (1/6) * \u03c0 * 1\u00b2 = \u03c0 / 6\n**4. Find the area of the trefoil:**\n* The trefoil consists of 6 circular sectors and 3 equilateral triangles.\n* Total area = 6 * (area of one sector) + 3 * (area of one triangle)\n* Total area = 6 * (\u03c0 / 6) + 3 * (\u221a3 / 4)\n* **Total area = \u03c0 + (3\u221a3) / 4**\n**Therefore, the area of the trefoil is \u03c0 + (3\u221a3) / 4 square units.** \n"
