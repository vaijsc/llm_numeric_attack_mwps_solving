    "solution": "Point $M$ has coordinates $(4,9)$. Therefore, its image has coordinates $(4,-9)$. Thus the sum is $\\boxed{-5}$.\n\nAlternatively, the image of point $M$ is the midpoint of the images of points $P$ and $R$ and thus is the midpoint of $(1,-3)$ and $(7,-15)$, which is also $(4,-9)$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the midpoint M:**\n* The midpoint of a segment is found by averaging the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates of the endpoints.\n*  The x-coordinate of M is (1 + 7)/2 = 4\n* The y-coordinate of M is (3 + 15)/2 = 9\n* So, point M is located at (4, 9).\n**2. Reflect PR over the x-axis:**\n*  Reflecting a point over the x-axis means changing the sign of its y-coordinate.\n*  The image of P (1, 3) is P' (1, -3).\n* The image of R (7, 15) is R' (7, -15).\n**3. Find the midpoint of the reflected segment:**\n* The x-coordinate of the midpoint of P'R' is (1 + 7)/2 = 4.\n* The y-coordinate of the midpoint of P'R' is (-3 - 15)/2 = -9.\n* So, the image of point M is located at (4, -9).\n**4. Sum the coordinates of the image of M:**\n* The sum of the coordinates is 4 + (-9) = **-5**. \n",
