Let $r$ be the radius of the eighth sphere, centered at $P.$ Then $AP = r + 1$ and $OP = 3 - r$ (since the radius of the larger sphere is $3$). We also know that $AO = 2,$ since $A$ is a vertex of the hexagon and $O$ is the center of the hexagon. Thus, by Pythagoras, \\[2^2 + (3-r)^2 = (r+1)^2,\\]or $r^2 - 6r + 13 = r^2 + 2r + 1.$ Then $8r = 12,$ and so $r = \\boxed{\\tfrac{3}{2}}.$",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Setup**\nImagine a regular hexagon with side length 2. Place a sphere of radius 1 at each vertex of the hexagon.  Now imagine a larger sphere that encloses all six smaller spheres.  Finally, picture a smaller sphere nestled in the center, touching all six of the smaller spheres and the larger sphere.\n**2. Find the Radius of the Larger Sphere**\n* **Connecting the Centers:** Draw lines connecting the center of the hexagon to the center of each smaller sphere. These lines form six equilateral triangles (since each side is the radius of the larger sphere plus the radius of a smaller sphere).\n* **Side Length of Triangle:** The side length of each equilateral triangle is 1 (radius of smaller sphere) + 1 (radius of larger sphere) + 1 (radius of smaller sphere) = 3.\n* **Finding the Height:** The height of an equilateral triangle with side length 3 is  (3\u221a3)/2.\n* **Radius of Larger Sphere:** The height of the triangle is also the radius of the larger sphere plus the radius of a smaller sphere. So, the radius of the larger sphere is (3\u221a3)/2 - 1.\n**3. Find the Distance from the Center of the Hexagon to the Center of a Smaller Sphere**\n* **Focus on a Single Triangle:** Consider one of the equilateral triangles formed by connecting the center of the hexagon, the center of a smaller sphere, and a vertex of the hexagon.\n* **Right Triangle:** Draw an altitude from the center of the hexagon to the midpoint of the side of the hexagon.  This creates a 30-60-90 right triangle.\n* **Finding the Distance:** The hypotenuse of this triangle is 1 (radius of smaller sphere) + 1 (half the side length of the hexagon) = 2.  The short leg is half the hypotenuse, which is 1.  The long leg (the distance we want) is \u221a3 times the short leg, which is \u221a3.\n**4. Find the Radius of the Eighth Sphere**\n* **Center-to-Center Distance:**  The distance from the center of the hexagon to the center of the eighth sphere is the radius of the larger sphere minus the radius of the eighth sphere.  This distance is also \u221a3 (from the previous step).\n* **Equation:** We can write this as: (3\u221a3)/2 - 1 - radius of eighth sphere = \u221a3\n* **Solving for the Radius:**  Simplify and solve for the radius of the eighth sphere: \n   * (3\u221a3)/2 - \u221a3 - 1 = radius of eighth sphere\n   * (\u221a3)/2 - 1 = radius of eighth sphere\n**Therefore, the radius of the eighth sphere is (\u221a3)/2 - 1.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Setup**\nImagine a regular hexagon with side length 2. At each vertex, place a sphere of radius 1. These spheres will be tangent to each other.  Enclose these spheres within a larger sphere, ensuring each of the smaller spheres is tangent to the inside of the larger sphere. Finally, picture a smaller sphere nestled in the center, touching all six of the smaller spheres and the larger sphere.\n**2. Find the Radius of the Larger Sphere**\n* Draw a line segment connecting the center of the hexagon to the center of one of the smaller spheres. This line segment will pass through the point where the sphere is tangent to the larger sphere.\n* This line segment is the radius of the larger sphere, and it consists of the radius of one of the smaller spheres (1) plus the distance from the center of the smaller sphere to the center of the hexagon (which is half the length of a side of the hexagon, or 1).\n* Therefore, the radius of the larger sphere is 1 + 1 = 2.\n**3. Find the Distance from the Center of the Hexagon to the Center of the Eighth Sphere**\n* Draw a line segment from the center of the hexagon to the center of the eighth sphere. This line segment will pass through the center of one of the smaller spheres.\n* Let the distance from the center of the hexagon to the center of the eighth sphere be *x*.  Then the distance from the center of the hexagon to the center of one of the smaller spheres is *x* + 1 (the radius of the eighth sphere plus the radius of one of the smaller spheres).\n* This distance is also the radius of the larger sphere (which we found to be 2).  So we have the equation *x* + 1 = 2.\n**4. Solve for the Radius of the Eighth Sphere**\n* Solving the equation *x* + 1 = 2, we find *x* = 1.\n* Therefore, the radius of the eighth sphere is *x* = **1**. \n",
        "Here's a step-by-step solution to find the radius of the eighth sphere:\n**1. Visualize the Setup**\nImagine a regular hexagon with side length 2. At each vertex, place a sphere of radius 1.  These spheres are all tangent to a larger sphere, which we'll call sphere $A$.  The eighth sphere, which we'll call sphere $B$, is nestled in the space between the six smaller spheres and is tangent to the larger sphere $A$.\n**2.  Find the Radius of Sphere A**\n*  Let $O$ be the center of the hexagon (and also the center of sphere $A$).\n*  Let $P$ be the center of one of the smaller spheres.\n*  Connect $O$ and $P$. This line segment is a radius of sphere $A$ and also a diagonal of one of the equilateral triangles that make up the hexagon. \n*  Since the side length of the hexagon is 2, the side length of each equilateral triangle is also 2.\n*  The height of an equilateral triangle with side length 2 is $\\sqrt{3}$, so the radius of sphere $A$ is $OP = 1 + \\sqrt{3}$.\n**3. Find the Radius of Sphere B**\n* Let $Q$ be the center of sphere $B$. \n* Connect $O$, $Q$, and $P$. This forms a right triangle with right angle at $Q$. \n*  $OQ$ is the radius of sphere $A$ (we know this is $1 + \\sqrt{3}$).\n*  $PQ$ is the radius of sphere $B$, which we want to find.\n*  $OP$ is the sum of the radii of sphere $A$ and sphere $B$ (i.e., $OP = 1 + PQ$).\n**4.  Use the Pythagorean Theorem**\nIn right triangle $OQP$, we have:\n* $OQ^2 = OP^2 - PQ^2$\nSubstitute the values we know:\n* $(1+\\sqrt{3})^2 = (1+PQ)^2 - PQ^2$\n**5. Solve for PQ**\nExpand and simplify the equation:\n* $4 + 2\\sqrt{3} = 1 + 2PQ + PQ^2 - PQ^2$\n* $3 + 2\\sqrt{3} = 2PQ$\n* $PQ = \\boxed{\\frac{3 + 2\\sqrt{3}}{2}}$ \nTherefore, the radius of the eighth sphere is $\\frac{3 + 2\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Setup**\nImagine a regular hexagon with six spheres of radius 1 centered at each vertex.  These spheres are all touching a larger sphere that encloses them.  The eighth sphere we're looking for sits inside the larger sphere, touching the six smaller spheres.\n**2. Find the Radius of the Larger Sphere**\n* **Focus on a Triangle:**  Consider a triangle formed by the center of the hexagon, the center of one of the smaller spheres, and a point where the smaller sphere touches the larger sphere.\n* **Equilateral Triangle:** This triangle is equilateral.  Why? The side length of the hexagon is 2, which is twice the radius of the smaller sphere.  This means the distance from the center of the hexagon to the center of each smaller sphere is also 1.\n* **Radius of Larger Sphere:** The hypotenuse of this equilateral triangle is the radius of the larger sphere.  Since the sides of an equilateral triangle are all equal, and the height of an equilateral triangle is \u221a3/2 times its side length, the radius of the larger sphere is 1 + (\u221a3/2) = (2 + \u221a3)/2.\n**3. Find the Distance from the Center of the Hexagon to the Center of the Eighth Sphere**\n* **Symmetry:** The eighth sphere is centered at the center of the hexagon.  \n* **Distance to Small Sphere:** The distance from the center of the hexagon to the center of one of the smaller spheres is 1.\n* **Distance to Eighth Sphere:**  The distance from the center of the hexagon to the center of the eighth sphere is 1 plus the radius of the eighth sphere.\n**4. Set Up an Equation**\n* **Sum of Distances:** The distance from the center of the hexagon to the center of the eighth sphere plus the radius of the eighth sphere must equal the radius of the larger sphere.\n* **Equation:** (1 + radius of eighth sphere) + radius of eighth sphere = (2 + \u221a3)/2\n**5. Solve for the Radius of the Eighth Sphere**\n* **Simplify:** 2 * radius of eighth sphere + 1 = (2 + \u221a3)/2\n* **Isolate the Radius:** 2 * radius of eighth sphere = (\u221a3)/2\n* **Solve:** radius of eighth sphere = **\u221a3/4**\n**Therefore, the radius of the eighth sphere is \u221a3/4.** \n",

Find the Radius of the Larger Sphere**\n* **Draw a Diagram:**  Draw a diagram of the hexagon, the larger sphere, and one of the smaller spheres. Draw a line from the center of the hexagon to the center of one of the smaller spheres. This line will also pass through the center of the larger sphere.\n* **Use Geometry:**  The line you drew is the radius of the larger sphere, and it consists of the radius of one of the smaller spheres (1) plus the distance from the center of a smaller sphere to the center of the hexagon (which is half the side length of the hexagon, or 1). \n* **Calculate:** Therefore, the radius of the larger sphere is 1 + 1 = 2.\n**3.

The line from the center of the eighth sphere to the center of a smaller sphere is the sum of the radii of the two spheres.\n* **Apply Pythagorean Theorem:** The three lines form a right triangle. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can relate the lengths of the sides:  (radius of larger sphere - radius of eighth sphere)^2 = (radius of smaller sphere + radius of eighth sphere)^2 + (distance from the center of a smaller sphere to the center of the hexagon)^2.\n**4. Solve for the Radius of the Eighth Sphere**\n* **Substitute Values:** Substitute the known values: (2 - r)^2 = (1 + r)^2 + 1^2.\n* **Expand and Solve:** Expand the equation and solve for r. You'll get a quadratic equation. Solve it to find the radius of the eighth sphere. \n**Calculations:**\n(2 - r)^2 = (1 + r)^2 + 1^2\n4 - 4r + r^2 = 1 + 2r + r^2 + 1\n6r = 2\nr = 1/3\n**Answer:** The radius of the eighth sphere is **1/3**. \n"
