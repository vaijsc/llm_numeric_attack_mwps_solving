Use Angle Relationships**\n* **Angle Sum Property:** The angles in a triangle add up to 180\u00b0. Applying this to triangle $ACD$:\n    * \u2220ACD + \u2220CAD + \u2220CDA = 180\u00b0\n    * 22.5\u00b0 + 22.5\u00b0 + \u2220CDA = 180\u00b0\n    * \u2220CDA = 135\u00b0\n* **Exterior Angle Theorem:** The measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent interior angles. Applying this to triangle $BAD$ with exterior angle \u2220CDA:\n    * \u2220CDA = \u2220BAD + \u2220ABD\n    * 135\u00b0 = $x$ + $x$\n    * 135\u00b0 = 2$x$\n    * $x$ = 67.5\u00b0\n**4.
