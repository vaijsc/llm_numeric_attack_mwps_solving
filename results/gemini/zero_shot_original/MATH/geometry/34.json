        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the coordinates of the points:**\n* **A:** (15, 0)\n* **B:** (15, 8)\n* **C:** (6, 8)\n* **D:** (6, 0)\n* **E:** (10, 0)  (Since DE = 4 and AD = 8)\n* **H:** (9, 8) (Since BH = 6 and BC = 9)\n**2. Find the equation of line EC:**\n* **Slope of EC:**  (8 - 0) / (6 - 10) = -2\n* **Equation of EC:** Using point-slope form with point C (6, 8): y - 8 = -2(x - 6)  =>  y = -2x + 20\n**3. Find the equation of line AH:**\n* **Slope of AH:** (8 - 0) / (9 - 15) = -4/3\n* **Equation of AH:** Using point-slope form with point A (15, 0): y - 0 = (-4/3)(x - 15) =>  y = (-4/3)x + 20\n**4. Find the coordinates of point G:**\n* **Intersection of EC and AH:** Solve the system of equations:\n    * y = -2x + 20\n    * y = (-4/3)x + 20\n* **Solving for x:** -2x + 20 = (-4/3)x + 20  =>  x = 0\n* **Solving for y:** y = -2(0) + 20  => y = 20\n* **Therefore, G:** (0, 20)\n**5. Find the equation of line GF:**\n* **Slope of GF:**  Since GF is perpendicular to AF, the slope of GF is the negative reciprocal of the slope of AF.\n* **Slope of AF:** (20 - 0) / (0 - 15) = -4/3\n* **Slope of GF:** 3/4\n* **Equation of GF:** Using point-slope form with point G (0, 20): y - 20 = (3/4)(x - 0) => y = (3/4)x + 20\n**6. Find the coordinates of point F:**\n* **Intersection of GF and AD:** Since AD is a vertical line, the x-coordinate of F is 6.  Substitute x = 6 into the equation of GF:\n    * y = (3/4)(6) + 20 = 24.5\n* **Therefore, F:** (6, 24.5)\n**7. Calculate the length of GF:**\n* **Using the distance formula:** \n    * GF = \u221a((0 - 6)\u00b2 + (20 - 24.5)\u00b2) = \u221a(36 + 20.25) = \u221a56.25 \n    * **GF = 7.5**\n**Therefore, the length of GF is 7.5 units.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the area of triangle ABC.**\n* Since ABCD is a rectangle, angle ABC is a right angle.\n*  Therefore, triangle ABC is a right triangle with legs AB = 8 and BC = 9.\n*  The area of triangle ABC is (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 8 * 9 = 36.\n**2. Find the area of triangle AHC.**\n*  AHC is a right triangle with legs AH = 6 (since BH = 6 and AB = 8) and CH = 3 (since BC = 9 and BH = 6).\n*  The area of triangle AHC is (1/2) * 6 * 3 = 9.\n**3. Find the area of triangle AGC.**\n*  The area of triangle AGC is the difference between the areas of triangles ABC and AHC: 36 - 9 = 27.\n**4. Find the length of AC.**\n*  Since ABCD is a rectangle, AC is the diagonal.\n*  Using the Pythagorean theorem: AC\u00b2 = AB\u00b2 + BC\u00b2 = 8\u00b2 + 9\u00b2 = 145.\n*  Therefore, AC = \u221a145.\n**5. Find the length of AG.**\n*  Let AG = x.  Using the formula for the area of a triangle: 27 = (1/2) * AG * CH = (1/2) * x * 3.\n*  Solving for x, we get x = 18.\n**6. Find the length of AF.**\n*  AF is part of diagonal AC.  \n*  AF = AC - GF = \u221a145 - GF.\n**7. Find the length of GF.**\n*  Triangle AGF is a right triangle with legs AG = 18 and GF = ? and hypotenuse AF = \u221a145 - GF.\n*  Using the Pythagorean theorem: (\u221a145 - GF)\u00b2 = 18\u00b2 + GF\u00b2.\n*  Expanding and solving for GF: 145 - 2\u221a145 * GF + GF\u00b2 = 324 + GF\u00b2.\n*  Simplifying:  -2\u221a145 * GF = 179\n*  Therefore, GF = -179 / (2\u221a145).\n**8. Simplify the answer.**\n*  Rationalize the denominator: GF = -179 / (2\u221a145) * (\u221a145 / \u221a145) = -179\u221a145 / 290.\n**Therefore, the length of GF is -179\u221a145 / 290.**  Note that the negative sign indicates that GF is directed opposite to the direction of the positive y-axis. \n",
        "Here's a step-by-step solution to find the length of $\\overline{GF}$:\n**1. Similar Triangles**\n* Notice that $\\triangle AHG \\sim \\triangle ECG$.  This is because $\\angle AGH = \\angle EGC$ (vertical angles) and $\\angle GAH = \\angle GEC$ (alternate interior angles since $\\overline{AH} \\parallel \\overline{EC}$).\n**2. Finding Proportions**\n* Since the triangles are similar, their corresponding sides are proportional.  We can use this to set up ratios: \n   \n   \\[\\frac{AH}{EC} = \\frac{GH}{GC} = \\frac{AG}{EG}\\]\n**3. Finding Lengths**\n*  We can use the given information to find some lengths:\n    *  $AH = AB - BH = 8 - 6 = 2$\n    *  $EC = \\sqrt{DE^2 + DC^2} = \\sqrt{4^2 + 9^2} = \\sqrt{97}$\n    *  $DC = BC = 9$\n    *  $DE = 4$\n**4.  Using the Proportions**\n* We want to find $GF$, which is part of $GH$.  Let's use the proportion $\\frac{AH}{EC} = \\frac{GH}{GC}$:\n   \n   \\[\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{97}} = \\frac{GH}{GC}\\]\n*  We also know that $GC = GH + HC$.  To find $HC$, consider $\\triangle HCB$.  Since $\\triangle HCB$ is a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem:\n   \\[HC = \\sqrt{BC^2 - BH^2} = \\sqrt{9^2 - 6^2} = \\sqrt{45} = 3\\sqrt{5}\\]\n**5. Solving for GH**\n* Now we can substitute $GC = GH + 3\\sqrt{5}$ into our proportion:\n   \\[\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{97}} = \\frac{GH}{GH + 3\\sqrt{5}}\\]\n* Cross-multiplying and solving for $GH$ gives:\n   \\begin{align*}\n   2(GH + 3\\sqrt{5}) &= \\sqrt{97} GH \\\\\n   2GH + 6\\sqrt{5} &= \\sqrt{97} GH \\\\\n   6\\sqrt{5} &= (\\sqrt{97} - 2)GH \\\\\n   GH &= \\frac{6\\sqrt{5}}{\\sqrt{97} - 2}\n   \\end{align*}\n**6. Finding GF**\n* Finally, we can use the fact that $GF = GH - HF$.  Since $\\triangle FGH$ is a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem:\n   \\[HF = \\sqrt{GH^2 - GF^2}\\]\n* We want to find $GF$, so we'll substitute $HF = \\sqrt{GH^2 - GF^2}$ into the equation $GF = GH - HF$:\n   \\begin{align*}\n   GF &= GH - \\sqrt{GH^2 - GF^2} \\\\\n   GF + \\sqrt{GH^2 - GF^2} &= GH \\\\\n   \\sqrt{GH^2 - GF^2} &= GH - GF\n   \\end{align*}\n* Square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n   \\[GH^2 - GF^2 = (GH - GF)^2\\]\n* Expand and simplify:\n   \\[GH^2 - GF^2 = GH^2 - 2GHGF + GF^2\\]\n   \\[2GHGF = 2GF^2\\]\n   \\[GHGF = GF^2\\]\n* Since we found $GH$ earlier, we can substitute it in and solve for $GF$:\n   \\[\\left(\\frac{6\\sqrt{5}}{\\sqrt{97} - 2}\\right) GF = GF^2\\]\n* Divide both sides by $GF$ (assuming $GF$ is not zero):\n   \\[\\frac{6\\sqrt{5}}{\\sqrt{97} - 2} = GF\\]\n**Therefore, the length of $\\overline{GF}$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{6\\sqrt{5}}{\\sqrt{97} - 2}}$.** \n",

Find the area of triangle ABH:**\n* Base: $BH = 6$\n* Height: $AB = 8$\n* Area: $(1/2) * 6 * 8 = 24$\n**3. Find the area of triangle ACH:**\n* Area of triangle ACH = Area of triangle ABC - Area of triangle ABH \n* Area of triangle ACH = 36 - 24 = 12\n**4.

        "Here's a step-by-step solution to find the length of $\\overline{GF}$:\n**1. Similar Triangles:**\n* **Triangle Similarity:**  Notice that triangles $AGH$ and $ECG$ are similar.  Why? Because they share angle $\\angle G$ and both have right angles (since $\\overline{AH}$ and $\\overline{EC}$ are perpendicular to $\\overline{BC}$ and $\\overline{AD}$, respectively).\n* **Side Ratios:**  Since the triangles are similar, the ratios of their corresponding sides are equal.  Let's write down these ratios:\n    *  $\\frac{AG}{EG} = \\frac{AH}{EC} = \\frac{GH}{GC}$\n**2.

We also know that $EG = ED + DG = 4 + DG$.  Let's substitute these values and solve for $AG$:\n    *  $\\frac{AG}{4 + DG} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{7}}{\\sqrt{97}}$\n    *  $AG\\sqrt{97} = 8\\sqrt{7} + 2\\sqrt{7} DG$\n    *  $AG(\\sqrt{97} - 2\\sqrt{7}DG) = 8\\sqrt{7}$\n    *  $AG = \\frac{8\\sqrt{7}}{\\sqrt{97} - 2\\sqrt{7}DG}$\n* **Finding GH:** Now we can find $GH$ using the equation we derived earlier:\n    * $GH = AH - AG$\n    * $GH = 2\\sqrt{7} - \\frac{8\\sqrt{7}}{\\sqrt{97} - 2\\sqrt{7}DG}$\n**4.  Finding GF:**\n* **Using Right Triangle GFH:**  Triangle $GFH$ is a right triangle. We know $GH$ (from the previous step) and we know $HF = AF - AH = AD - DE - AH = 6 - 4 - 2\\sqrt{7} = 2 - 2\\sqrt{7}$.  We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find $GF$:\n    * $GF = \\sqrt{GH^2 + HF^2}$\n**5. Solving for GF:**\nSubstitute the values we found for $GH$ and $HF$ into the Pythagorean Theorem and simplify.  This will give you the length of $\\overline{GF}$. \n**Note:** The solution involves a fair amount of algebra and simplification.
