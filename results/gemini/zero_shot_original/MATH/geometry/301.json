    "solution": "To start, we can make three equilateral triangles, with sides $2,2,2$, $4,4,4$ and $6,6,6$.  Next, look at isosceles triangles.  If two sides have length 6, the remaining side could be $2$ since $6+2>6$ and $6+6>2$.  The remaining side could also be 4 since $6+4>6$ and $6+6>4$.  So, this is two more triangles.  If two sides have length 4, the remaining side could have length $6$ since $6+4>4$ and $4+4>6$.  The remaining side could also have length 2 since $2+4>4$ and $4+4>2$.  There are no possible triangles with all sides of different length, since $2+4=6$.  Thus, there are a total of $\\boxed{7}$ non congruent triangles.",

This is crucial for determining which combinations of sticks will form valid triangles.\n**Possible Combinations**\nLet's systematically list the possible combinations of stick lengths and check if they satisfy the Triangle Inequality:\n* **2, 2, 2:**  This won't form a triangle (2 + 2 = 4, not greater than 2).\n* **2, 2, 4:**  This won't form a triangle (2 + 2 = 4, not greater than 4).\n* **2, 2, 6:**  This won't form a triangle (2 + 2 = 4, not greater than 6).\n* **2, 4, 4:**  This will form a triangle (2 + 4 > 4, 2 + 4 > 4, 4 + 4 > 2).\n* **2, 4, 6:**  This will form a triangle (2 + 4 > 6, 2 + 6 > 4, 4 + 6 > 2).\n* **2, 6, 6:**  This will form a triangle (2 + 6 > 6, 2 + 6 > 6, 6 + 6 > 2).\n* **4, 4, 4:**  This will form a triangle (4 + 4 > 4, 4 + 4 > 4, 4 + 4 > 4).\n* **4, 4, 6:**  This will form a triangle (4 + 4 > 6, 4 + 6 > 4, 4 + 6 > 4).\n* **4, 6, 6:**  This will form a triangle (4 + 6 > 6, 4 + 6 > 6, 6 + 6 > 4). \n* **6, 6, 6:**  This will form a triangle (6 + 6 > 6, 6 + 6 > 6, 6 + 6 > 6).\n**Counting the Non-Congruent Triangles**\nWe've identified nine possible combinations.
