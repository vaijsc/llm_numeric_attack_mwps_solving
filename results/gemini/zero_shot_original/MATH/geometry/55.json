    "solution": "Consider the two chords with an endpoint at 5. The arc subtended by the angle determined by these chords extends from 10 to 12, so the degree measure of the arc is $(2/12)(360)=60$.  By the Central Angle Theorem, the degree measure of this angle is $(1/2)(60)=30$. By symmetry, the degree measure of the angle at each vertex is $\\boxed{30}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Star**\nImagine a clock face.  Draw lines connecting 12 to 5, 5 to 10, 10 to 3, and so on.  You'll see a five-pointed star formed within the clock face.\n**2. Focus on One Vertex**\nLet's focus on the vertex where the lines from 12 to 5 and 5 to 10 meet.  We want to find the angle at this vertex.\n**3. Break Down the Angle**\n*  The angle at the vertex is formed by two straight lines: 12-5 and 5-10.\n*  Think of extending these lines to form a complete circle around the center of the clock.  \n*  This circle is divided into 12 equal sections (360 degrees / 12 sections = 30 degrees per section).\n**4. Calculate the Angle**\n* The angle between the lines 12-5 and 5-10 encompasses **four** of these 30-degree sections (from 12 to 5 is 4 sections). \n* Therefore, the angle at the vertex is 4 sections * 30 degrees/section = **120 degrees**.\n**5. Generalization**\nThis logic applies to each vertex of the star-polygon.  Each vertex will have an angle of 120 degrees. \n**Answer:** The degree measure of the angle at each vertex in the star-polygon is **120 degrees**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Star**\nImagine a clock face.  Draw lines connecting the numbers as described: 12 to 5, 5 to 10, 10 to 3, and so on. You'll see a five-pointed star shape within the circle of the clock.\n**2. Focus on a Single Vertex**\nLet's consider the vertex at the number 12. The lines forming this vertex are 12-5 and 12-1.\n**3. Calculate the Central Angle**\nThe central angle formed by these lines (at the center of the clock) is 5/12 of the whole circle. This is because the difference between 12 and 1 is 5, and there are 12 numbers on the clock.  \n* Central angle = (5/12) * 360\u00b0 = 150\u00b0\n**4. Calculate the Vertex Angle**\nThe angle at the vertex of the star (at the number 12) is supplementary to the central angle.  This is because the central angle and the vertex angle together form a straight line.\n* Vertex angle = 180\u00b0 - 150\u00b0 = 30\u00b0\n**5. Conclusion**\nSince each vertex of the star is formed in the same way, each vertex angle in the star-polygon has a degree measure of **30 degrees**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Star**\nImagine a standard clock face.  Draw lines connecting 12 to 5, 5 to 10, 10 to 3, and so on. You'll end up with a five-pointed star shape inside the clock.\n**2. Focus on a Single Vertex**\nLet's focus on the vertex at the \"12\" position. The lines connecting to it are from the \"5\" and the \"9\" positions.\n**3. Calculate the Angle at the Center**\nThe angle at the center of the clock face formed by the hands pointing at the \"5\" and the \"9\" is  (5/12) * 360 degrees = 150 degrees.  \n**4. Use Triangle Geometry**\nThe star vertex at \"12\" is one of the vertices of a triangle formed by the center of the clock, the \"5\" position, and the \"12\" position. This is an isosceles triangle because the lines from the center to the clock face are radii of the same circle.\n**5. Find the Base Angles of the Triangle**\nThe two base angles of this isosceles triangle are equal.  Since the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees, each base angle is (180 - 150) / 2 = 15 degrees.\n**6. The Vertex Angle**\nThe angle at the star's vertex (\"12\") is the supplement of the base angle of the triangle.  Therefore, the angle at each vertex of the star is 180 - 15 = **165 degrees**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Star**\nImagine a clock face.  Connect the numbers 12 to 5, 5 to 10, 10 to 3, and so on. You'll see a five-pointed star forming within the clock face.\n**2. Focus on One Vertex**\nLet's consider the vertex formed at the number 12. The lines connecting to this vertex are from 12 to 5 and from 12 to 9 (going clockwise).\n**3. Use Clock Angles**\n* The angle between the 12 and the 5 is one-sixth of a full circle (360 degrees), so it's 60 degrees.\n* The angle between the 12 and the 9 is three-twelfths (or one-fourth) of a full circle, which is 90 degrees.\n**4. Calculate the Vertex Angle**\nThe angle at the vertex at 12 is the difference between these two angles: 90 degrees - 60 degrees = 30 degrees.\n**5. Generalization**\nNotice that each vertex of the star is formed by the same pattern: a smaller angle (1/6 of a circle) subtracted from a larger angle (some multiple of 1/12 of a circle).  This difference will always be 30 degrees.\n**Answer:** The degree measure of the angle at each vertex in the star-polygon is **30 degrees**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Star**\nImagine a clock face.  Draw lines connecting the numbers 12 to 5, 5 to 10, 10 to 3, and so on, following the pattern of skipping four numbers clockwise. You'll see a five-pointed star within the circle of the clock.\n**2.  Focus on One Vertex**\nLet's focus on the vertex formed at the number 12. The lines forming this vertex connect 12 to 5 and 12 to 9.\n**3.  Angles in a Circle**\nA circle has 360 degrees.  Since there are 12 numbers on a clock, each number represents a section of the circle with a central angle of 360/12 = 30 degrees.\n**4.  Angle at the Vertex**\nThe angle at vertex 12 is made up of the following:\n* The central angle from 12 to 5 (30 degrees * 4 = 120 degrees)\n* The central angle from 12 to 9 (30 degrees * 7 = 210 degrees)\n**5.  Calculate the Vertex Angle**\nThe angle at vertex 12 is 120 degrees + 210 degrees = 330 degrees.  \n**6.  Symmetry**\nDue to the symmetry of the star, all the vertex angles are equal. \n**Answer:** The degree measure of the angle at each vertex in the star-polygon is **330 degrees**. \n"
