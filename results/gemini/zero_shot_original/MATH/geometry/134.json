        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Area Formula**\nThe area of a triangle is given by:\nArea = (1/2) * base * height\n**2. Find the Height of Triangle XYZ**\n* We know the base of triangle XYZ is 30.\n* We know the area is 120. \n* Let the height of triangle XYZ be *h*. \n* Substitute into the area formula: 120 = (1/2) * 30 * *h*\n* Solve for *h*: *h* = 8\n**3. Find the Base of the Second Triangle**\n* Since both triangles have the same area, the second triangle must have a different base and height.\n* Let the base of the second triangle be *b*.\n* We know the height of the second triangle must also be 8 (since it's an isosceles triangle with the same area).\n* Substitute into the area formula: 120 = (1/2) * *b* * 8\n* Solve for *b*: *b* = 30\n**4. Determine the Sides of the Second Triangle**\n* The second triangle is isosceles, meaning it has two equal sides.\n* The base of the second triangle is 30. \n* Let the length of the equal sides be *s*.\n* Using the Pythagorean Theorem on half of the second triangle (forming a right triangle with base 15 and height 8): \n    * *s*\u00b2 = 15\u00b2 + 8\u00b2 \n    * *s*\u00b2 = 289\n    * *s* = 17\n**5. Calculate the Perimeter**\n* The perimeter of the second triangle is 30 (base) + 17 (side) + 17 (side) = **64**\n**Therefore, the perimeter of the second isosceles triangle is 64.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the height of triangle XYZ**\n* Draw an altitude from vertex Y to base XZ. This divides the triangle into two congruent right triangles.\n* The base of each right triangle is 15.\n* We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the height (let's call it *h*):  17\u00b2 = 15\u00b2 + *h*\u00b2\n* Solving for *h*, we get *h* = 8.\n**2. Calculate the area of triangle XYZ**\n* The area of a triangle is (1/2) * base * height.\n* Area of triangle XYZ = (1/2) * 30 * 8 = 120\n**3. Find the possible side lengths of the second triangle**\n* We know the area of the second triangle is also 120.\n* Let the base of the second triangle be *b* and the height be *h*.  We have the equation (1/2) * *b* * *h* = 120, or *b* * *h* = 240.\n* Since the triangle is isosceles, the base and two equal sides must all be integers.  We need to find integer pairs (*b*, *h*) that multiply to 240.\n**4. Test possible pairs**\n* Some possible pairs for (*b*, *h*) are (1, 240), (2, 120), (3, 80), (4, 60), (5, 48), (6, 40), (8, 30), (10, 24), (12, 20), (15, 16), (16, 15), (20, 12), (24, 10), (30, 8), (40, 6), (48, 5), (60, 4), (80, 3), (120, 2), and (240, 1).\n* We need to check which of these pairs leads to an isosceles triangle.  The height of an isosceles triangle is always perpendicular to the base and bisects it.  So the height and half the base form the legs of a right triangle.\n**5. Find the matching pair**\n* The only pair that forms a right triangle with integer side lengths is (16, 15) because 16\u00b2 + 15\u00b2 = 481 = 23\u00b2 (this follows from the Pythagorean triple 15, 20, 25).\n* This means the second triangle has a base of 16 and two equal sides of length 23.\n**6. Calculate the perimeter of the second triangle**\n* The perimeter of the second triangle is 16 + 23 + 23 = **62**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the height of the given triangle:**\n* We know the base of the triangle is 30.\n* The triangle is isosceles, so we can draw a perpendicular from the top vertex to the base, dividing the triangle into two right triangles.\n*  Each right triangle has a base of 15 and a hypotenuse of 17.  We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the height:\n   *  $17^2 = 15^2 + h^2$\n   *  $289 = 225 + h^2$\n   *  $h^2 = 64$\n   *  $h = 8$\n**2. Use the area to find the base of the second triangle:**\n* The area of a triangle is (1/2) * base * height.\n* We know the area is 120 and the height is 8:\n   *  $120 = (1/2) * b * 8$\n   *  $120 = 4b$\n   *  $b = 30$\n**3. Find the legs of the second triangle:**\n* The second triangle is isosceles, so its base (30) is split into two equal segments of length 15.\n* We can use the Pythagorean Theorem again, this time using the height (8) and half the base (15) to find the length of a leg:\n   *  $l^2 = 15^2 + 8^2$\n   *  $l^2 = 225 + 64$\n   *  $l^2 = 289$\n   *  $l = 17$\n**4. Calculate the perimeter of the second triangle:**\n* The second triangle has two sides of length 17 and one side of length 30.\n* Perimeter = 17 + 17 + 30 = **64**\n**Therefore, the perimeter of the second triangle is 64.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Find the height of triangle XYZ**\n*  Since triangle XYZ is isosceles, the altitude from vertex Y to the base XZ bisects XZ. \n*  This creates two right triangles, each with legs of length 15 and an unknown height (let's call it *h*).\n*  We can use the Pythagorean Theorem:  17\u00b2 = 15\u00b2 + *h*\u00b2\n*  Solving for *h*, we get *h* = 8.\n**2.  Calculate the area of triangle XYZ using the height**\n*  The area of a triangle is (1/2) * base * height.\n*  Area of triangle XYZ = (1/2) * 30 * 8 = 120 \n**3.  Find the possible dimensions of the second triangle**\n*  Since the second triangle also has an area of 120, we need to find other combinations of base and height that multiply to 240 (twice the area).\n*  The factors of 240 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 16, 20, 24, 30, 40, 48, 60, 80, 120, and 240.\n*  We need to find pairs of factors that could represent the base and height of an isosceles triangle.  \n**4.  Find the correct combination**\n*  Notice that 16 and 15 are factors of 240.  This means a triangle with a base of 16 and a height of 15 would have an area of 120. \n**5.  Calculate the side length of the second triangle**\n*  Since the triangle is isosceles, the height bisects the base.  The two legs of the right triangle formed are 8 and 15.\n*  Using the Pythagorean Theorem, the side length of the second triangle is \u221a(8\u00b2 + 15\u00b2) = \u221a289 = 17.\n**6.  Calculate the perimeter of the second triangle**\n*  The perimeter is 17 + 17 + 16 = **50**. \n**Therefore, the perimeter of the second triangle is 50.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Find the height of triangle XYZ:**\n* The base of triangle XYZ is 30.\n* The area of a triangle is (1/2) * base * height.  \n* We know the area is 120, so: 120 = (1/2) * 30 * height\n* Solving for the height, we get height = 8.\n**2. Use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the other side:**\n* The height divides the isosceles triangle into two right triangles.\n* One leg of each right triangle is 15 (half the base).\n* The other leg is the height, 8.\n* Let the other side of the isosceles triangle be represented by  's'. \n* Using the Pythagorean Theorem:  s\u00b2 = 15\u00b2 + 8\u00b2 = 289\n* So, s = \u221a289 = 17.\n**3. Find the perimeter of triangle XYZ:**\n* The perimeter is 30 + 17 + 17 = 64.\n**4. Consider the other isosceles triangle:**\n* Since the area of both triangles is 120, and the area formula is (1/2) * base * height, the product of the base and height must be the same for both triangles.\n* We found that the base of XYZ is 30 and the height is 8, so their product is 240.\n*  To find the base and height of the other triangle, we need to find factors of 240 that could be the base and height of an isosceles triangle.\n**5. Find the factors of 240 and consider their possibilities:**\n* Factors of 240 include: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 16, 20, 24, 30, 40, 48, 60, 80, 120, and 240.\n*  To be an isosceles triangle, the base must be even, and the height must be less than half the base.  \n**6.  The only possibility:**\n* The only factors that fit the criteria are a base of 40 and a height of 6.\n**7.  Find the other side length:**\n* Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we get: s\u00b2 = 20\u00b2 + 6\u00b2 = 436.\n* So, s = \u221a436 = 2\u221a109.\n**8. Calculate the perimeter of the second triangle:**\n* Perimeter = 40 + 2\u221a109 + 2\u221a109 = **40 + 4\u221a109**.\n**Therefore, the perimeter of the second isosceles triangle is 40 + 4\u221a109.** \n"
