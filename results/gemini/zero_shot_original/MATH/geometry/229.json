        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Set up the Equations**\n* **Volume of a sphere:**  V = (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3\n* **Surface area of a sphere:** SA = 4\u03c0r\u00b2\nWe are given that the volume and surface area are numerically equal: \nV = SA\n**2. Substitute and Solve**\nSubstitute the formulas for volume and surface area into the equation:\n(4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3 = 4\u03c0r\u00b2\nNow, solve for 'r':\n* Divide both sides by 4\u03c0:  (1/3)r\u00b3 = r\u00b2\n* Subtract r\u00b2 from both sides: (1/3)r\u00b3 - r\u00b2 = 0\n* Factor out r\u00b2:  r\u00b2( (1/3)r - 1) = 0\nThis gives us two possible solutions:\n* r\u00b2 = 0  => r = 0 (This solution doesn't make sense for a sphere)\n* (1/3)r - 1 = 0 => r = 3\n**3. The Answer**\nThe radius of the sphere is **3 units**. \n",

Set up the equations**\n* **Volume of a sphere:**  V = (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3\n* **Surface area of a sphere:** SA = 4\u03c0r\u00b2\nSince the volume and surface area are numerically equal, we can write:\n(4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3 = 4\u03c0r\u00b2\n**2. Simplify the equation**\n* Divide both sides by 4\u03c0r\u00b2: \n   (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3 / (4\u03c0r\u00b2) = 4\u03c0r\u00b2 / (4\u03c0r\u00b2)\n* This simplifies to: (1/3)r = 1\n**3.
