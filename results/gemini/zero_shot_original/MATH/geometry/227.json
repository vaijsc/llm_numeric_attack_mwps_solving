        "Here's a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n**1. Understand the Problem**\nWe're given a triangle with sides of length 7, 8, and 9.  We're also told that a point *D* lies on the circle that circumscribes the triangle, and that line segment *AD* bisects angle *BAC*.  Our goal is to find the ratio of the lengths of *AD* and *CD*.\n**2. Visualize the Situation**\nDraw a diagram of the triangle *ABC* and the point *D* on the circumcircle. Since *AD* bisects angle *BAC*, we know that angles *BAD* and *CAD* are equal. \n[asy]\nunitsize(0.8cm);\npair A,B,C,D;\nA=(0,0);\nB=(-sqrt(15)/2,-1/2);\nC=(sqrt(15)/2,-1/2);\nD=IP(CR(A,sqrt(15)/2),CR(B,8));\ndraw(Circle(A,sqrt(15)/2));\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(A--D);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,SW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,W);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,E);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,N);\nlabel(\"$7$\",(A+B)/2,W);\nlabel(\"$8$\",(A+C)/2,E);\nlabel(\"$9$\",(B+C)/2,S);\nlabel(\"$x$\",(A+D)/2,NW);\nlabel(\"$y$\",(C+D)/2,NE);\n[/asy]\n**3.

Use Similar Triangles**\nSince angles *BAD* and *BCD* are equal, and angles *ABD* and *ACD* are both right angles (inscribed angles intercepting a diameter), triangles *ABD* and *ACD* are similar.\nThis means the ratio of corresponding sides is equal:  AD/CD = AB/AC = 7/8.\n**6. Answer**\nTherefore, the value of AD/CD is **7/8**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understanding the Angle Bisector Theorem**\nThe Angle Bisector Theorem states that in a triangle, the angle bisector divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the lengths of the other two sides.  In our case, since AD bisects angle BAC, we have:\n*  BD/DC = AB/AC = 7/8\n**2. Using the Law of Cosines**\nWe can find the cosine of angle BAC using the Law of Cosines on triangle ABC:\n*  BC\u00b2 = AB\u00b2 + AC\u00b2 - 2(AB)(AC)cos(BAC)\n*  9\u00b2 = 7\u00b2 + 8\u00b2 - 2(7)(8)cos(BAC)\n*  81 = 49 + 64 - 112cos(BAC)\n*  cos(BAC) = 1/4\n**3. Applying the Law of Cosines again**\nNow, focus on triangle ABD. We can use the Law of Cosines again to find AD:\n* AD\u00b2 = AB\u00b2 + BD\u00b2 - 2(AB)(BD)cos(BAC)\n* AD\u00b2 = 7\u00b2 + BD\u00b2 - 2(7)(BD)(1/4)\n* AD\u00b2 = 49 + BD\u00b2 - (7/2)BD\nSimilarly, for triangle ACD:\n* AC\u00b2 = AD\u00b2 + CD\u00b2 - 2(AD)(CD)cos(BAC)\n* 8\u00b2 = AD\u00b2 + CD\u00b2 - 2(AD)(CD)(1/4)\n* 64 = AD\u00b2 + CD\u00b2 - (1/2)(AD)(CD)\n**4.  Solving for AD/CD**\nWe have two equations with two unknowns (AD and BD).  We can solve for AD/CD by following these steps:\n* **Express BD in terms of DC:**  From the Angle Bisector Theorem, BD = (7/8)DC.\n* **Substitute BD:** Substitute this value of BD into both equations involving AD\u00b2.\n* **Eliminate AD\u00b2:** Subtract the equation for AD\u00b2 from the triangle ABD from the equation for AD\u00b2 from triangle ACD.  This eliminates AD\u00b2.\n* **Simplify:** Simplify the resulting equation and solve for AD/CD.\n**Here's the detailed calculation:**\n1. **Substitute BD:**\n   * In the equation for triangle ABD:  AD\u00b2 = 49 + (7/8)DC\u00b2 - (7/2)(7/8)DC = 49 + (49/64)DC\u00b2 - (49/16)DC\n   * In the equation for triangle ACD: 64 = AD\u00b2 + CD\u00b2 - (1/2)(AD)(CD)\n2. **Subtract equations:**\n   * (64 - 49) = (1 - 49/64)DC\u00b2 - (1/2)(AD)(CD) + (49/16)DC\n3. **Simplify:**\n   * 15 = (15/64)DC\u00b2 - (1/2)(AD)(CD) + (49/16)DC\n   * Multiply both sides by 64: 960 = 15DC\u00b2 - 32(AD)(CD) + 196DC\n4. **Solve for AD/CD:**\n   * Rearrange the equation: 32(AD)(CD) = 15DC\u00b2 + 196DC - 960\n   * Divide both sides by 32DC: AD/CD = (15DC + 196)/32 \n5. **Simplify:**\n   * AD/CD = (15/32) + (49/8) * (1/DC)\nSince we don't have a specific value for DC, we can't get a numerical answer for AD/CD.  However, we have expressed it in terms of DC, which is enough for many problems. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Problem**\nWe're given a triangle with sides of known lengths. We're also given a point D on the circle that circumscribes the triangle, with AD bisecting angle BAC.  We need to find the ratio AD/CD.\n**2.  Use the Angle Bisector Theorem**\nThe Angle Bisector Theorem states that in a triangle, an angle bisector divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the lengths of the other two sides. In our case, AD bisects angle BAC, so:\n* BD/DC = AB/AC\n**3.  Apply the Law of Cosines**\nWe can use the Law of Cosines to find the lengths of BD and DC.  \n* **Finding BD:**\n    * Let angle BAC = 2x.  Then angle BAD = x.\n    * Apply the Law of Cosines to triangle ABD:\n       * BD\u00b2 = AB\u00b2 + AD\u00b2 - 2(AB)(AD)cos(x)\n* **Finding DC:**\n    * Apply the Law of Cosines to triangle ACD:\n       * DC\u00b2 = AC\u00b2 + AD\u00b2 - 2(AC)(AD)cos(x)\n**4.  Substitute and Solve**\n* **Substitute BD/DC = AB/AC:**  This gives us \n    * (AB\u00b2 + AD\u00b2 - 2(AB)(AD)cos(x)) / (AC\u00b2 + AD\u00b2 - 2(AC)(AD)cos(x)) = AB/AC\n* **Simplify the equation:**  Substitute the known values of AB, AC, and simplify the equation.  You'll get a quadratic equation in terms of AD.\n* **Solve for AD:** Solve the quadratic equation to find the value of AD.\n* **Calculate CD:**  Use the Angle Bisector Theorem (BD/DC = AB/AC) and the value of AD to find the value of CD.\n* **Find AD/CD:**  Calculate the desired ratio.\n**5.  The Solution**\nAfter substituting and solving, you will find that AD/CD = **7/8**. \nLet me know if you would like me to show the detailed algebraic steps! \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Angle Bisector Theorem**\nSince AD bisects \u2220BAC, the Angle Bisector Theorem tells us:\n*  BD/DC = AB/AC = 7/8\n**2.  Power of a Point**\nLet's call the center of the circumcircle O.  Draw radii OA, OB, and OC. \n*  Since OA, OB, and OC are radii, they are all equal in length.\n*  Triangle OAB and triangle OAC are isosceles triangles.\n*  Angles ABO and ACO are equal because they are base angles of isosceles triangles.\nConsider the power of point D with respect to the circle:\n*  DA * DB = DC * DD' (where DD' is the external segment of the secant through D)\n*  Since DD' = 2 * radius of the circle, we can rewrite this as: DA * DB = DC * 2 * radius\n**3.  Putting it Together**\nWe know that BD/DC = 7/8.  Let's express BD and DC in terms of a common variable, say 'x':\n* BD = 7x\n* DC = 8x\nSubstitute these values into the power of a point equation:\n* DA * 7x = 8x * 2 * radius\nSimplify:\n* DA * 7 = 16 * radius\nNow, we want to find AD/CD. Let's express AD in terms of radius:\n* AD = (16 * radius) / 7\nFinally, we can find AD/CD:\n* AD/CD = [(16 * radius) / 7] / (8x) = (16 * radius) / (56x) = **(2 * radius) / (7x)**\n**4.  Key Observation**\nNotice that the answer doesn't depend on the actual value of the radius or x.  This is because the ratio AD/CD is determined solely by the ratio of AB/AC, which is given as 7/8. \n**Therefore, AD/CD = 2/7** \n",
