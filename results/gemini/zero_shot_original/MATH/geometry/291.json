        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Concepts**\n* **Cylinder:** A three-dimensional shape with two parallel circular bases connected by a curved surface.\n* **Sphere:** A perfectly round three-dimensional object where every point on the surface is the same distance from the center.\n* **Circumscribe:** To draw a figure around another figure so that the outer figure touches the inner figure at all points.\n**2. Visualize the Situation**\nImagine a cylinder with a sphere perfectly inside it. The sphere touches the top and bottom of the cylinder and the sides of the cylinder. The diameter of the sphere is equal to the height of the cylinder and the diameter of the cylinder. \n**3. Set up the Equations**\n* **Volume of a cylinder:**  V = \u03c0r\u00b2h, where r is the radius and h is the height.\n* **Volume of a sphere:** V = (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3, where r is the radius.\n**4. Relate the Dimensions**\n* Since the sphere is circumscribed within the cylinder, the radius of the sphere (r_s) is equal to half the height of the cylinder (h/2).\n**5. Solve for the Cylinder's Dimensions**\nWe know the volume of the cylinder is 60 cubic centimeters:\n* 60 = \u03c0r\u00b2h\nSince r_s = h/2, we can substitute h = 2r_s into the equation:\n* 60 = \u03c0r\u00b2(2r_s)\n* 60 = 2\u03c0r\u00b2r_s\n**6. Find the Volume of the Sphere**\nNow we can use the volume of the sphere formula:\n* V_sphere = (4/3)\u03c0r_s\u00b3 \nTo find r_s, we can rearrange the equation we got in step 5:\n* 60 = 2\u03c0r\u00b2r_s\n* r_s = 30/(\u03c0r\u00b2)\nSubstitute this value of r_s into the sphere's volume formula:\n* V_sphere = (4/3)\u03c0(30/(\u03c0r\u00b2))\u00b3\n* V_sphere = (4/3)\u03c0(27000/(\u03c0\u00b3r\u2076))\n* V_sphere = (108000\u03c0)/(3\u03c0\u00b3r\u2076)\n* V_sphere = 36000/(\u03c0\u00b2r\u2076)\n**7. We can't find a numerical answer for the sphere's volume**\nNotice that the final answer for the volume of the sphere includes 'r', the radius of the cylinder. Without knowing the radius of the cylinder, we cannot determine the volume of the sphere. \n**Conclusion:**\nWe can express the volume of the sphere in terms of the radius of the cylinder: V_sphere = 36000/(\u03c0\u00b2r\u2076) cubic centimeters.  However, we need more information about the cylinder's dimensions to find a numerical answer for the sphere's volume. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Relationship**\n* **Circumscribed Sphere:** A sphere that completely encloses a cylinder touches the cylinder at its top, bottom, and along its curved surface.\n* **Key Insight:** The diameter of the sphere is equal to the height of the cylinder.\n**2.  Formulas**\n* **Volume of a Cylinder:**  V = \u03c0r\u00b2h, where r is the radius and h is the height.\n* **Volume of a Sphere:** V = (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3, where r is the radius.\n**3.  Set Up the Problem**\n* We know the cylinder's volume is 60 cubic centimeters. Let's call the cylinder's radius 'r' and its height 'h'.\n* We want to find the volume of the sphere.  Let's call the sphere's radius 'R'.\n**4.  Relate the Dimensions**\n* We know h (cylinder's height) = 2R (sphere's diameter)\n**5.  Solve for the Cylinder's Dimensions**\n*  We have V (cylinder) = 60 = \u03c0r\u00b2h \n*  Since h = 2R, we can substitute: 60 = \u03c0r\u00b2(2R)\n**6.  Solve for the Sphere's Radius**\n*  We need to express the sphere's radius (R) in terms of the cylinder's radius (r). \n*  Rearranging the equation from step 5, we get: R = 30/(\u03c0r\u00b2) \n**7.  Calculate the Sphere's Volume**\n*  V (sphere) = (4/3)\u03c0R\u00b3\n*  Substitute the expression for R from step 6: V (sphere) = (4/3)\u03c0(30/(\u03c0r\u00b2))\u00b3\n*  Simplify: V (sphere) = (4/3)\u03c0 * (27000/(\u03c0\u00b3r\u2076))\n*  Cancel out \u03c0 and simplify: V (sphere) = (36000)/(\u03c0\u00b2r\u2076)\n**8.  We can't find an exact numerical answer without knowing the cylinder's radius (r).** \n**However, we have a formula to calculate the sphere's volume if we know the cylinder's radius.** \n",
