    "solution": "The area of the shaded region equals the area of the circle minus the area of the triangle.  The area of the circle is $2^2\\pi=4\\pi$.  To find the area of the triangle, we look for information about the triangle.  Because angle $ACB$ intersects $180^\\circ$ of the circle, we know $m\\angle ACB=\\frac{180^\\circ}2=90^\\circ$, so triangle $ACB$ is a right triangle.  What's more, since $AB=4$ and $BC=2$, it follows that $AC=2\\sqrt{3}$ and the area of right triangle $ACB$ equals $\\frac{2\\cdot2\\sqrt{3}}2=2\\sqrt{3}$.  So, the area of the shaded region is $\\boxed{4\\pi - 2\\sqrt{3}}$.",

Find the radius of the circle:**\n* Since AB is a diameter, the radius of the circle is half the length of AB:  radius = AB/2 = 4 cm / 2 = 2 cm.\n**2.

Find the area of triangle ABC:**\n* Since triangle ABC is a right triangle (inscribed in a semicircle), we can use the formula: Area = (1/2) * base * height.\n* The base is BC = 2 cm, and the height is the radius of the circle (2 cm).\n* Area = (1/2) * 2 cm * 2 cm = 2 cm\u00b2\n**4. Find the area of the shaded region:**\n* The shaded region is the difference between the area of the circle and the area of the triangle.\n* Shaded Area = Area of Circle - Area of Triangle\n* Shaded Area = 4\u03c0 cm\u00b2 - 2 cm\u00b2 = (4\u03c0 - 2) cm\u00b2\n**Therefore, the area of the shaded region is (4\u03c0 - 2) cm\u00b2.** \n",
