        "We can find the area of quadrilateral $ABCD$ by dividing it into two triangles: triangle $ABC$ and triangle $ACD$.\n**Area of Triangle ABC:**\n* Base:  $BC$ has a length of $\\sqrt{(5-1)^2 + (2-3)^2} = \\sqrt{17}$.\n* Height: The perpendicular distance from $A$ to line $BC$.  To find this, we can use the fact that the slope of $BC$ is $\\frac{2-3}{5-1} = -\\frac{1}{4}$.  The slope of a line perpendicular to $BC$ is the negative reciprocal of this, which is 4.  The equation of the line through $A$ with slope 4 is $y-1 = 4(x-0)$, or $y=4x+1$.  We can find the intersection of this line with line $BC$ by solving the system of equations:\n  * $y=4x+1$\n  * $y = -\\frac{1}{4}x + \\frac{13}{4}$ \nSetting the right-hand sides equal, we get $4x+1 = -\\frac{1}{4}x + \\frac{13}{4}$.  Solving for $x$, we find $x = \\frac{9}{17}$.  Substituting back into either equation, we find $y = \\frac{41}{17}$.  The distance from $A(0,1)$ to this point is $\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{9}{17}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{24}{17}\\right)^2} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{85}}{17}$.\nTherefore, the area of triangle $ABC$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{17} \\cdot \\frac{3\\sqrt{85}}{17} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{5}}{2}$.\n**Area of Triangle ACD:**\n* Base:  $CD$ has a length of $\\sqrt{(4-5)^2 + (0-2)^2} = \\sqrt{5}$.\n* Height: The perpendicular distance from $A$ to line $CD$.  The slope of $CD$ is $\\frac{0-2}{4-5} = 2$.  The slope of a line perpendicular to $CD$ is $-\\frac{1}{2}$.  The equation of the line through $A$ with slope $-\\frac{1}{2}$ is $y-1 = -\\frac{1}{2}(x-0)$, or $y = -\\frac{1}{2}x + 1$.  We can find the intersection of this line with line $CD$ by solving the system of equations:\n  * $y = -\\frac{1}{2}x + 1$\n  * $y = 2x - 8$\nSetting the right-hand sides equal, we get $-\\frac{1}{2}x + 1 = 2x - 8$.  Solving for $x$, we find $x = \\frac{18}{5}$.  Substituting back into either equation, we find $y = -\\frac{4}{5}$.  The distance from $A(0,1)$ to this point is $\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{18}{5}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{9}{5}\\right)^2} = \\frac{9\\sqrt{5}}{5}$.\nTherefore, the area of triangle $ACD$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{5} \\cdot \\frac{9\\sqrt{5}}{5} = \\frac{9}{2}$.\n**Total Area:**\nThe area of quadrilateral $ABCD$ is the sum of the areas of the two triangles: $\\frac{3\\sqrt{5}}{2} + \\frac{9}{2} = \\boxed{\\frac{9+3\\sqrt{5}}{2}}$. \n",
