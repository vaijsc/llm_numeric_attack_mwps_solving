        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n1. **Find the side length of square ABCD:** Since the area of square ABCD is 100 square centimeters, each side has a length of  \u221a100 = 10 centimeters.\n2. **Find the side length of square EFGH:** Notice that AE = 2 cm and AB = 10 cm.  Therefore, BE = AB - AE = 10 - 2 = 8 cm.  Since BE is a side of square EFGH, its side length is 8 cm.\n3. **Calculate the area of square EFGH:** The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of square EFGH is 8 * 8 = **64 square centimeters**. \n",
