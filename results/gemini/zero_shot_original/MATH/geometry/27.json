    "solution": "Let $s$ be the side length of the cube.  The volume of the cube is $s^3$ and the sum of the lengths of the edges of the cube is $12s$.  Therefore, we must have $s^3 = 6\\cdot 12s$, so $s^3=72s$.  Subtracting $72s$ from both sides gives\n\\[\ns^3-72s=0,\n\\]so \\[\ns(s^2-72)=0, \n\\]which means \\[\ns = 0 \\text{ or } s=\\pm \\sqrt{72}\n\\] Discarding the non-positive solutions, we find $s=\\sqrt{72}=6\\sqrt{2}$.  The volume of the cube is $s^3=6^3\\cdot(\\sqrt{2})^3=\\boxed{432\\sqrt{2}}$ cubic units.",
