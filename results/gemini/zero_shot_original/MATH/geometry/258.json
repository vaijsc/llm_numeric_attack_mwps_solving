        "Here's a step-by-step solution to find the volume of the pyramid:\n**1. Visualize the Pyramid:**\nImagine a square pyramid where the base is a square, and the four triangular faces meet at a point called the apex (P).  We're told one of these triangular faces, triangle PBD, is equilateral with side length 6.\n**2. Find the Height of the Pyramid:**\n* **Draw an altitude:** Draw a line segment from the apex P perpendicular to the base ABCD. This is the height of the pyramid, let's call it 'h'.\n* **Focus on triangle PBD:** Since PBD is equilateral, the altitude from P to BD bisects BD. This means the altitude divides triangle PBD into two 30-60-90 right triangles.\n* **Use the 30-60-90 Triangle Ratios:** In a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1:\u221a3:2.  Since BD is 6, the shorter leg of the 30-60-90 triangle is 3, and the longer leg (which is the height of the pyramid) is 3\u221a3.\n**3. Find the Side Length of the Square:**\n* **Consider the Base:** The base of the pyramid is a square.  Let's call the side length of the square 's'.\n* **Focus on triangle PBD again:** The height of the pyramid (h) is also the altitude of the equilateral triangle PBD.  This means the height 'h' divides the base BD of the equilateral triangle into two equal segments of length 3.\n* **Apply the Pythagorean Theorem:** In triangle PBD, we know BD = 6 and h = 3\u221a3. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the side length of the square:\n   * s\u00b2 = 3\u00b2 + (3\u221a3)\u00b2 = 9 + 27 = 36\n   * s = 6\n**4. Calculate the Volume:**\n* **Volume Formula:** The volume of a pyramid is given by: (1/3) * (Area of Base) * (Height)\n* **Apply the values:** The area of the square base is s\u00b2 = 6\u00b2 = 36.  The height of the pyramid is 3\u221a3.\n* **Volume Calculation:** (1/3) * 36 * 3\u221a3 = **36\u221a3**\n**Therefore, the volume of the pyramid PABCD is 36\u221a3 cubic units.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Pyramid**\nImagine a square pyramid where the base is a square and the apex (point P) is directly above the center of the square.  The triangle PBD is one of the triangular faces of the pyramid, and it's an equilateral triangle.\n**2. Find the Height of the Pyramid**\n* Draw an altitude from point P to the base ABCD, and let the foot of the altitude be point O.  \n*  Since PBD is equilateral, point O is also the midpoint of BD.\n*  Triangle POD is a 30-60-90 right triangle, where:\n    *  PD = 6 (side of the equilateral triangle)\n    *  OD = 3 (half of the side of the equilateral triangle)\n    *  PO is the height of the pyramid, which we need to find.\n**3. Use the 30-60-90 Triangle Ratios**\nIn a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1 : \u221a3 : 2.  Since OD = 3, we can find PO:\n*  PO = OD * \u221a3 = 3\u221a3\n**4. Find the Area of the Base**\n*  The base ABCD is a square with side length BD = 6.\n*  Area of the square = side\u00b2 = 6\u00b2 = 36\n**5. Calculate the Volume**\n*  Volume of a pyramid = (1/3) * (Area of base) * (Height)\n*  Volume of PABCD = (1/3) * 36 * 3\u221a3 = **36\u221a3** \n**Therefore, the volume of the pyramid PABCD is 36\u221a3 cubic units.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Pyramid**\nImagine a square pyramid with its apex (point P) directly above the center of the square base (ABCD).  Since triangle PBD is equilateral, all three sides are equal to 6.\n**2. Find the Height of the Pyramid**\n* Draw an altitude from point P to the base of the pyramid, intersecting the square at point O. This altitude is the height of the pyramid.\n* Triangle PBO is a 30-60-90 right triangle because it is half of the equilateral triangle PBD. \n* The hypotenuse PB is 6, and the shorter leg BO is half the length of PB, so BO = 3.\n* The longer leg PO (the height of the pyramid) is \u221a3 times the shorter leg BO, so PO = 3\u221a3.\n**3. Find the Side Length of the Square Base**\n* The diagonal of the square base, BD, is equal to the side length of the equilateral triangle, which is 6.\n* Let the side length of the square be 's'.  Using the Pythagorean theorem on right triangle ABD:\n    * s\u00b2 + s\u00b2 = 6\u00b2\n    * 2s\u00b2 = 36\n    * s\u00b2 = 18\n    * s = 3\u221a2\n**4. Calculate the Volume**\n* The volume of a pyramid is (1/3) * (area of the base) * (height).\n* Area of the square base = s\u00b2 = (3\u221a2)\u00b2 = 18\n* Volume = (1/3) * 18 * 3\u221a3 = **18\u221a3**\n**Therefore, the volume of pyramid PABCD is 18\u221a3 cubic units.** \n",

We're told that triangle PBD is equilateral, meaning all sides are equal (6 units in this case).\n**2. Find the Height of the Pyramid**\n* Draw a perpendicular line from point P to the base, intersecting the base at point O (the center of the square). This line represents the height of the pyramid (let's call it 'h').\n* Triangle POD is a 30-60-90 right triangle (because triangle PBD is equilateral, so PD bisects angle PBD, creating a 30-60-90 triangle). \n* In a 30-60-90 triangle, the hypotenuse is twice the length of the shorter leg, and the longer leg is the square root of 3 times the shorter leg.\n* Since PD = 6, then OD (the shorter leg) is 6/2 = 3.\n* Therefore, the height h (the longer leg) is 3\u221a3.\n**3. Find the Side Length of the Square**\n* Triangle POD is also a 30-60-90 triangle, so OD = 3.\n* Since O is the center of the square, line OD is half the length of a side of the square.\n* Therefore, the side length of the square (AB) is 2 * OD = 2 * 3 = 6.\n**4.
