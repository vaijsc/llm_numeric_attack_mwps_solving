        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**Understanding Isosceles Triangles**\n* An isosceles triangle has two sides of equal length. \n**The Triangle Inequality Theorem**\n* The Triangle Inequality Theorem states that the sum of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side.\n**Applying the Theorem**\n1. **Identify the sides:** We have sides of 15 cm and 10 cm. Since it's an isosceles triangle, the third side must also be either 10 cm or 15 cm.\n2. **Consider the possibilities:**\n   * **If the third side is 10 cm:**  We need to check if 10 + 10 > 15, which is true. This is a valid triangle.\n   * **If the third side is 15 cm:** We need to check if 10 + 15 > 15, which is also true. This is also a valid triangle.\n3. **Find the greatest perimeter:**\n   * The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of all its sides.\n   *  Perimeter with sides 10 cm, 10 cm, and 15 cm: 10 + 10 + 15 = 35 cm\n   * Perimeter with sides 10 cm, 15 cm, and 15 cm: 10 + 15 + 15 = 40 cm\n**Answer:** The greatest possible perimeter of the isosceles triangle is **40 cm**. \n",

Let's assume the two equal sides are 15 cm each.\n**Step 2: Apply the Triangle Inequality.**\n*  15 cm + 15 cm > 10 cm (True)\n*  15 cm + 10 cm > 15 cm (True)\n*  10 cm + 15 cm > 15 cm (True)\nThis confirms that a triangle can be formed with these side lengths.\n**Step 3: Calculate the perimeter.**\nThe greatest possible perimeter is achieved when the two equal sides are as long as possible. \nPerimeter = 15 cm + 15 cm + 10 cm = **40 cm**\n**Therefore, the greatest possible perimeter of this isosceles triangle is 40 cm.** \n",

To maximize the perimeter, we want the two equal sides to be the longer ones (15 cm each).\n2. **Apply the Triangle Inequality:**  To form a valid triangle, the third side must be less than the sum of the other two sides (15 cm + 15 cm = 30 cm).\n3. **Maximize the third side:**  The third side can be *almost* 30 cm, but it can't be equal to 30 cm.  \n4. **Calculate the perimeter:**  The greatest possible perimeter is 15 cm + 15 cm + (almost 30 cm) = **almost 60 cm**.\n**Therefore, the greatest possible perimeter of this triangle is almost 60 centimeters.** \n",
