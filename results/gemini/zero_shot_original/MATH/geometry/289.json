    "solution": "The large square, $ASHY$, is divided into seven regions. Two of these ($ABDC$ and $EFHG$) are squares. Four of the regions ($BSD,$ $CYD,$ $SFE,$ $YGE$) are right triangles. Finally, the seventh region is $DYES$, the quadrilateral whose area we wish to know. Thus, we subtract the area of the first six regions from the area of $ASHY$.\n\n$ASHY$ has side length $5$ and therefore has area $5^2=25$.\n\nThe two small squares each have side length $1$ and thus area $1$.\n\nThe right triangles each have legs of length $1$ and $4$ (since, for example, $CY = AY-AC = 5-1 = 4$). Thus, each right triangle has area $\\frac{1\\cdot 4}{2} = 2$.\n\nSubtracting the two small squares and the four right triangles from the large square, we determine that the area of $DYES$ is $$25 - 2\\cdot(1) - 4\\cdot(2) = \\boxed{15}.$$",
