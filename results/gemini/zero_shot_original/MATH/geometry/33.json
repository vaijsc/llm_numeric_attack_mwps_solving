        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Recognize the Special Triangle**\nNotice that the side lengths 7, 24, and 25 form a Pythagorean triple (7\u00b2 + 24\u00b2 = 25\u00b2).  This means the triangle is a right triangle, with the hypotenuse being 25.\n**2. Identify the Altitudes**\n* **Altitude to the Hypotenuse:** This altitude is the shortest leg of the right triangle, which has length 7.\n* **Altitude to the Longer Leg:** This altitude is the longer leg of the right triangle, which has length 24.\n* **Altitude to the Shorter Leg:** To find this, we can use the fact that the area of a triangle is (1/2) * base * height, and that this area is the same no matter which side we choose as the base. \n   *  Area using the hypotenuse as the base: (1/2) * 25 * 7 = 87.5\n   *  Area using the shorter leg as the base: (1/2) * 7 * h = 87.5\n   *  Solving for h (the altitude to the shorter leg): h = 25.\n**3. Calculate the Sum**\nThe sum of the lengths of the three altitudes is 7 + 24 + 25 = 56.\n**Answer:**  The sum of the lengths of the three altitudes is **56.00** units. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Recognize the Special Triangle:**\n* Notice that the sides of the triangle form a Pythagorean triple (7, 24, 25). This means the triangle is a right triangle, with the hypotenuse being 25.\n**2. Identify the Altitudes:**\n* An altitude in a triangle is a perpendicular line segment from a vertex to the opposite side. In a right triangle, the two legs are already altitudes.\n**3. Calculate the Area:**\n* The area of a triangle is given by (1/2) * base * height. Since the legs are altitudes, we can use them to calculate the area:\n    * Area = (1/2) * 7 * 24 = 84 square units\n**4.  Use the Area to Find the Third Altitude:**\n* The third altitude is drawn from the right angle vertex to the hypotenuse.  Let's call its length 'h'. \n* We can use the area again, this time using the hypotenuse as the base:\n    * Area = (1/2) * 25 * h = 84\n    * Solving for h, we get h = (84 * 2) / 25 = 6.72 units\n**5. Calculate the Sum of the Altitudes:**\n* Sum of altitudes = 7 + 24 + 6.72 = **37.72 units** \n",

This means the triangle is a right triangle.\n**2. Identify the Base and Height**\nIn a right triangle, the two legs are the base and height, and the hypotenuse is the longest side. So, our base is 7 and our height is 24.\n**3. Calculate the Area**\nThe area of a triangle is given by:  Area = (1/2) * base * height\nArea = (1/2) * 7 * 24 = 84 square units.\n**4. Find the Altitudes**\n* **Altitude to the hypotenuse:** This is the same as the height of the triangle, which is 24.\n* **Altitude to the leg of length 7:** Since the area of a triangle is constant regardless of which side is used as the base, we can use the formula:  Area = (1/2) * base * altitude.  \n   * Area = 84\n   * Base = 7\n   * Altitude = unknown \n   * 84 = (1/2) * 7 * altitude\n   * altitude = 24 \n* **Altitude to the leg of length 24:**  Using the same logic as above:\n   * Area = 84\n   * Base = 24\n   * Altitude = unknown\n   * 84 = (1/2) * 24 * altitude\n   * altitude = 7\n**5.

This means the triangle is a right triangle, with the hypotenuse being 25.\n**2. Identify the Altitudes**\nThe altitudes of a triangle are the perpendicular segments drawn from each vertex to the opposite side. In a right triangle, the two legs are already altitudes. The third altitude is the segment drawn from the right angle to the hypotenuse.\n**3. Calculate the Altitudes**\n* **Legs:** The legs are 7 and 24 units long.\n* **Altitude to the Hypotenuse:**  The area of a triangle is (1/2) * base * height.  We can calculate the area using any side as the base and the corresponding altitude as the height. \n    * Using the base of 24, the area is (1/2) * 24 * 7 = 84 square units.\n    *  Let the altitude to the hypotenuse be *h*.  The area is also (1/2) * 25 * *h* = 84 square units.\n    * Solving for *h*, we get *h* = 6.72 units.\n**4.

        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Recognize the Special Triangle:**\nThe triangle with sides 7, 24, and 25 is a Pythagorean triple, meaning it's a right triangle.  The longest side (25) is the hypotenuse.\n**2. Understand Altitudes in Right Triangles:**\n* The altitude from the right angle to the hypotenuse divides the right triangle into two smaller similar right triangles.\n* The altitude itself is one leg of each of these smaller triangles. \n**3. Use Similar Triangles:**\n* Let the altitude from the right angle be *h*. \n* The two segments the altitude divides the hypotenuse into are *x* and *y*, where *x + y = 25*.\n* Since the triangles are similar, we have the proportions: \n    *  *h/x* = *24/25*  (comparing the altitude to one leg in both triangles)\n    *  *h/y* = *7/25*  (comparing the altitude to the other leg in both triangles)\n**4. Solve for the Altitude:**\n* Solving the first proportion for *x*, we get *x = (25h)/24*.\n* Solving the second proportion for *y*, we get *y = (25h)/7*.\n* Since *x + y = 25*, we can substitute and get:  \n  *(25h)/24 + (25h)/7 = 25*\n* Multiplying both sides by the least common multiple of 24 and 7 (which is 168) gives:\n  * 35h + 60h = 4200\n  * 95h = 4200\n  * h = 44.21 \n**5. Find the Other Altitudes:**\n* To find the other two altitudes, we can use the area of a triangle:\n  *  Area = (1/2) * base * height \n* Since we know the sides of the triangle are 7, 24, and 25, we can use any two sides as the base and altitude. Let's use 7 and 24:\n  * Area = (1/2) * 7 * 24 = 84\n* Now, we can find the other two altitudes:\n    * Altitude to side 7:  84 / (24/2) = 7\n    * Altitude to side 24:  84 / (7/2) = 24\n**6. Calculate the Sum:**\n* The sum of the three altitudes is 44.21 + 7 + 24 = 75.21 \n**Answer:** The sum of the lengths of the three altitudes is approximately **75.21** units. \n"
