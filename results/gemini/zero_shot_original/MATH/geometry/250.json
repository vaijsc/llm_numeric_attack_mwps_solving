        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Rectangle**\nImagine a rectangle with vertices at (0,0), (6,0), (6,10), and (0,10). Point E is located on the top side of the rectangle at (2,10).\n**2. Find the Areas**\n* **Area of Rectangle ABCD:**  The length of the rectangle is 6, and the width is 10, so the area is 6 * 10 = 60.\n* **Area of Triangle ADE:**  The base of triangle ADE is AD, which has length 10. The height is AE, which has length 2. Therefore, the area of triangle ADE is (1/2) * 10 * 2 = 10.\n* **Area of Quadrilateral ABCE:**  This area is the area of the rectangle minus the area of triangle ADE: 60 - 10 = 50.\n**3. Calculate the Ratio**\nThe ratio of the area of triangle ADE to the area of quadrilateral ABCE is 10/50.\n**4. Simplify the Ratio**\nThe simplified ratio is **1/5**. \n",

Locate Point E**\nPoint **E** is on segment **CD**, 2 units to the right of **D** (and 4 units to the left of **C**).\n**3. Calculate Areas**\n* **Area of Rectangle ABCD:** The rectangle has a length of 6 and a width of 10, so its area is 6 * 10 = 60.\n* **Area of Triangle ADE:**  Triangle **ADE** has a base of 2 (the length of segment **DE**) and a height of 10 (the height of the rectangle).  Its area is (1/2) * 2 * 10 = 10.\n* **Area of Quadrilateral ABCE:**  You can find this area by subtracting the area of triangle **ADE** from the area of the rectangle: 60 - 10 = 50.\n**4.

Calculate Areas**\n* **Rectangle ABCD:** The base is 6 and the height is 10, so the area is 6 * 10 = 60 square units.\n* **Triangle ADE:** The base is AD = 10 and the height is AE = 2, so the area is (1/2) * 10 * 2 = 10 square units.\n**3. Find the Area of Quadrilateral ABCE**\nSince quadrilateral ABCE and triangle ADE make up the whole rectangle, the area of quadrilateral ABCE is:\nArea of ABCE = Area of ABCD - Area of ADE = 60 - 10 = 50 square units.\n**4.
