        "**1. Understanding the Problem**\nWe have a large square with smaller squares in the corners. We need to find the maximum distance between a vertex of a square formed by connecting the points W, X, Y, and Z (let's call this square ABCD) and the bottom right corner of the large square (point P).\n**2. Key Observations**\n* **Symmetry:**  The problem has symmetry. Since the smaller squares are placed symmetrically, square ABCD will also be symmetrical. \n* **Maximizing Distance:** To maximize the distance between A and P, we need to make sure that point A is as far away from point P as possible. This means point A should be as close as possible to the top left corner of the large square.\n**3. Finding the Optimal Position of A**\n* If we move point A closer to the top left corner, we need to adjust the positions of points W and Z to maintain the shape of square ABCD.\n* The optimal position for A will be when W and Z are as close as possible to the top and left edges of the large square, respectively. This means W will lie on the line segment connecting the top left corner of the large square to the top left corner of the small square in that corner, and Z will lie on the line segment connecting the top left corner of the large square to the bottom left corner of the small square in that corner.\n**4. Calculating the Distance**\n* Consider the right triangle formed by the top left corner of the large square, point W, and the top left corner of the small square in that corner.  The legs of this triangle have lengths 4 and 2, so the hypotenuse (the distance from the top left corner to W) is $\\sqrt{4^2 + 2^2} = 2\\sqrt{5}$.\n* Similarly, the distance from the top left corner of the large square to Z is also $2\\sqrt{5}$.\n* The distance from the top left corner to point A is then $2\\sqrt{5} + 2$ (the sum of the distances from the corner to W and from W to A). \n* Finally, the distance from A to P is the length of the diagonal of the large square minus the distance from the top left corner to A, which is $6\\sqrt{2} - (2\\sqrt{5} + 2) = \\boxed{6\\sqrt{2} - 2\\sqrt{5} - 2}$. \n",
        "To maximize the distance from $A$ to $P$, we want to make $AP$ as close to a diagonal of the larger square as possible.

        "**1. Understanding the Problem**\nWe have a large square with four smaller squares in the corners.  We need to find the maximum distance between a point on the larger square ($P$) and a vertex of a smaller square ($A$).\n**2. Finding Key Relationships**\n* **Symmetry:**  The problem has symmetry.  We can focus on finding the maximum distance from $P$ to $A$ and then realize that the same distance applies to the other corners.\n* **Pythagorean Theorem:** We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to relate distances within the squares and the larger square.\n**3. Visualizing the Maximum Distance**\nTo maximize the distance from $P$ to $A$, we need to place $A$ in a position where the distance between $P$ and $A$ is a diagonal of the large square. This occurs when $A$ is at the corner of one of the small squares closest to $P$, as shown:\n[asy]\npath square = scale(2) * unitsquare;\ndraw(square); draw(shift(4) * square); draw(shift(4, 4) * square); draw(shift(0, 4) * square);\ndraw((2, 0)--(4, 0)); draw((0, 2)--(0, 4)); draw((6, 2)--(6, 4)); draw((2, 6)--(4, 6));\npair a = shift(3, 4) * dir(135);\npair b = shift(4, 3) * dir(45);\npair c = shift(3, 2) * dir(-45);\npair d = shift(2, 3) * dir(-135);\ndraw(a--b--c--d--cycle);\ndraw(a--P,dashed);\nlabel(\"$2$\", (1, 6), N); label(\"$2$\", (3, 6), N); label(\"$2$\", (5, 6), N);\nlabel(\"$2$\", (6, 5), E); label(\"$2$\", (6, 3), E); label(\"$2$\", (6, 1), E);\nlabel(\"$W$\", (2, 4), NW); label(\"$X$\", (4, 4), NE); label(\"$Y$\", (4, 2), SE); label(\"$Z$\", (2, 2), SW);\nlabel(\"$A$\", a, N); label(\"$B$\", b, E); label(\"$C$\", c, S); label(\"$D$\", d, W); label(\"$P$\", (6, 0), SE);\n[/asy]\n**4. Calculating the Distance**\n* The diagonal of the large square has length $6\\sqrt{2}$.\n*  The distance from $P$ to the lower right corner of the large square is 2 (the side length of one of the small squares).\n* Therefore, the maximum distance from $A$ to $P$ is $6\\sqrt{2} - 2$.\n**Answer:** The maximum possible distance from $A$ to $P$ is $\\boxed{6\\sqrt{2} - 2}$. \n",
        "Let's break this problem down step by step:\n**1. Understand the Diagram**\n* You have a large square with side length 6.\n* Four smaller squares, each with side length 2, are placed in the corners of the large square.\n* Points W, X, Y, and Z are the vertices of these smaller squares.\n*  A new square ABCD is formed by connecting these points.\n* Point P is at the bottom right corner of the large square.\n**2. Finding the Maximum Distance**\nTo maximize the distance AP, we need to understand how the position of square ABCD affects the length of AP.\n* **Key Observation:** The distance AP will be maximized when point A is as far away from point P as possible. This happens when square ABCD is positioned such that point A is on the top edge of the large square.\n**3. Finding the Position of A**\n* Since A is a vertex of square ABCD and lies on the top edge of the large square, it must lie directly above one of the small squares.\n* To maximize AP, point A should be as far to the right as possible.  Therefore, A should be above the small square in the top right corner of the large square.\n**4. Calculating AP**\n* The distance from A to the top edge of the large square is 2 (the side length of the small square).\n* The distance from the top edge of the large square to point P is 6 (the side length of the large square).\n* Therefore, the maximum distance AP is 2 + 6 = **8**. \n",
        "**1. Focus on Triangle APB**\nTo maximize the distance from $A$ to $P$, we want to make triangle $APB$ as close to a right triangle as possible, with right angle at $P$.\n**2. Finding the Optimal Position of A**\n*  Notice that as we move point $A$ along line $WZ$, the angle $\\angle APB$ increases. \n*  Therefore, to maximize $AP$, we want to place $A$ as far as possible from $P$ along line $WZ$. This means placing $A$ at point $W$.\n**3.  Calculating AP**\n*  Now, we have a right triangle $WPB$ with $WP = 6$ and $PB = 2$.\n*  Using the Pythagorean theorem, we find $WB = \\sqrt{WP^2 + PB^2} = \\sqrt{6^2 + 2^2} = \\sqrt{40} = 2\\sqrt{10}$.\n**4. Conclusion**\nTherefore, the maximum possible distance from $A$ to $P$ is $\\boxed{2\\sqrt{10}}$. \n"
