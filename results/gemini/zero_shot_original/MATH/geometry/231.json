        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the Hypotenuse**\n* We know the lengths of the legs of the right triangle: $AB = 6$ and $BC = 3\\sqrt{3}$.\n* Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the hypotenuse, $AC$:  \n   *  $AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2 = 6^2 + (3\\sqrt{3})^2 = 36 + 27 = 63$\n   *  $AC = \\sqrt{63} = 3\\sqrt{7}$\n**2. Understand Medians**\n* A median of a triangle is a line segment from a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side.\n* Medians intersect at a point called the centroid. The centroid divides each median in a 2:1 ratio.\n**3. Find the Length of AM**\n* Since $M$ is the midpoint of $BC$, we have $BM = MC = \\frac{1}{2} BC = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\n* Triangle $ABM$ is also a right triangle. Use the Pythagorean theorem to find $AM$:\n   * $AM^2 = AB^2 + BM^2 = 6^2 + \\left(\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)^2 = 36 + \\frac{27}{4} = \\frac{162}{4}$\n   * $AM = \\frac{9\\sqrt{2}}{2}$\n**4. Find the Length of CP**\n* We know the centroid $P$ divides median $CN$ in a 2:1 ratio. This means $CP = \\frac{2}{3} CN$.\n* To find $CN$, use the fact that $N$ is the midpoint of $AB$: \n   * $AN = NB = \\frac{1}{2} AB = 3$\n* Now, consider triangle $ACN$.  Use the Pythagorean theorem to find $CN$:\n   * $CN^2 = AN^2 + AC^2 = 3^2 + (3\\sqrt{7})^2 = 9 + 63 = 72$\n   * $CN = 6\\sqrt{2}$\n* Finally, find $CP$:\n   * $CP = \\frac{2}{3} CN = \\frac{2}{3} (6\\sqrt{2}) = \\boxed{4\\sqrt{2}}$ \n",

Understand medians and the centroid**\n* A median of a triangle is a line segment drawn from a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side.\n* The centroid of a triangle is the point where the three medians intersect. It's a special point because it divides each median in a 2:1 ratio.\n**3. Apply the centroid property**\n* Since $CN$ is a median, point $P$ divides $CN$ in a 2:1 ratio. This means $CP = \\frac{2}{3} CN$.\n**4. Find the length of $CN$**\n* $CN$ is the median from vertex $C$ to side $AB$, so it bisects $AB$. Therefore, $AN = \\frac{1}{2} AB = 3$.\n* We can now use the Pythagorean theorem on right triangle $ACN$: $CN^2 = AC^2 - AN^2 = (3\\sqrt{7})^2 - 3^2 = 63 - 9 = 54$.\n* Thus, $CN = \\sqrt{54} = 3\\sqrt{6}$.\n**5.
