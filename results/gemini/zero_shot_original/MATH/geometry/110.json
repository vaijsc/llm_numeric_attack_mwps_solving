        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understanding Reflections:**\n* When a point is reflected over the y-axis, its x-coordinate changes sign while the y-coordinate remains the same.\n**2. Applying the Reflection:**\n* Since the point (a, b) is reflected over the y-axis to become (j, k), we know that:\n    * j = -a (the x-coordinate changes sign)\n    * k = b (the y-coordinate stays the same)\n**3. Using the Given Equations:**\n* We are given that a + j = 0 and b + k = 0.  Let's substitute our values from step 2 into these equations:\n    * a + (-a) = 0  (This is always true)\n    * b + b = 0 \n**4. Solving for b:**\n* Simplifying the second equation, we get:\n    * 2b = 0\n    * b = 0\n**Answer:** The value of b is **0**. \n",

Use the given equations:**\n* We are given  $a + j = 0$. Substitute  $j = -a$ into this equation:\n   *  $a + (-a) = 0$\n   *  This equation is always true, which means it doesn't give us any new information about the value of 'a'.\n* We are also given  $b + k = 0$. Since the y-coordinate doesn't change during a reflection over the y-axis, we know that $k = b$.  Substituting this into the equation:\n   *  $b + b = 0$\n   *  $2b = 0$\n**4.

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n1. **Understanding Reflection:** Reflecting a point over the y-axis means flipping it to the other side of the y-axis while keeping the same distance from the y-axis. This means the x-coordinate changes sign, and the y-coordinate stays the same.\n2. **Applying Reflection:** Since $(a, b)$ is reflected to $(j, k)$ over the y-axis, we know that:\n   *  j = -a (The x-coordinate changes sign)\n   *  k = b  (The y-coordinate stays the same)\n3. **Using the Given Information:** We are given that a + j = 0 and b + k = 0. \n4. **Solving for b:**\n    * Substitute j = -a into the equation a + j = 0:  a + (-a) = 0.
