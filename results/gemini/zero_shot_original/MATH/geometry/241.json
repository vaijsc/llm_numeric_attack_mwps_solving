        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Set up the relationship between the volumes:**\n* Let the radius of the sphere (and the cone's base) be *r*.\n* The volume of the sphere is  (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3.\n* The volume of the cone is (1/3)\u03c0r\u00b2h, where *h* is the cone's height.\n* Since the melted ice cream fills the cone, and this represents 75% of the frozen ice cream's volume, we have: (1/3)\u03c0r\u00b2h = (3/4) * (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3 \n**2.
