        "Here's a step-by-step solution to find the area of hexagon $AOBCPD$:\n**1.  Understanding the Geometry**\n* **Tangents:**  The lines $\\overline{AD}$ and $\\overline{BC}$ are tangent to both circles.  This means they form right angles with the radii at the points of tangency.\n* **Symmetry:** The hexagon is symmetrical about the line segment $\\overline{OP}$. This is due to the way the tangents are drawn. \n**2.  Key Observations**\n* **Right Triangles:**  Triangles $OAD$ and $PBC$ are right triangles.\n* **Congruent Triangles:**  Triangles $OAD$ and $PBC$ are congruent (by SAS congruence:  they share a hypotenuse, and the legs are radii of the circles).  \n* **Quadrilaterals:** Quadrilaterals $OABD$ and $PBCD$ are trapezoids.\n**3.  Calculations**\n* **Finding the Height of the Trapezoids:** Let's call the height of the trapezoids $h$. Since $\\overline{AD}$ and $\\overline{BC}$ are tangent to the circles, we can find the height by looking at the right triangle $OAD$:  $h = OA + AP = 2 + 4 = 6$.\n* **Finding the Bases of the Trapezoids:** The bases of the trapezoids are the diameters of the circles.  $OA = OB = 2$ and $PC = PD = 4$.\n* **Area of a Trapezoid:** The area of a trapezoid is given by $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot h \\cdot (b_1 + b_2)$.  Therefore:\n    * Area of $OABD$ = $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 6 \\cdot (2 + 4) = 18$\n    * Area of $PBCD$ = $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 6 \\cdot (4 + 8) = 36$\n* **Area of the Hexagon:**  The area of hexagon $AOBCPD$ is the sum of the areas of the two trapezoids:  $18 + 36 = \\boxed{54}$. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Understanding the Geometry**\n* We have two circles, one with radius 2 (centered at O) and the other with radius 4 (centered at P).\n* The circles are externally tangent, meaning they touch at a single point, and their centers lie on a line.\n* We have two common external tangents, AD and BC, which touch both circles.\n* We need to find the area of the concave hexagon AOBCPD.\n**2.  Key Observations**\n* **Right Angles:**  The points where the tangents touch the circles form right angles. For example,  \u2220OAD and \u2220ODA are right angles. \n* **Congruent Triangles:**  Triangles OAD and OBC are congruent (by SAS). Similarly, triangles PBC and PDA are congruent (by SAS).\n* **Rectangle:**  The quadrilateral OPDQ (where Q is the intersection of AD and BC) is a rectangle.\n**3.  Finding the Dimensions**\n* **OP:**  Since the circles are externally tangent, the distance between their centers (OP) is the sum of their radii: OP = 2 + 4 = 6.\n* **OD:**  Triangle ODA is a right triangle with OA = 2 and AD = 4 (because it's a common tangent). Using the Pythagorean theorem, we get: \n   OD = \u221a(AD\u00b2 - OA\u00b2) = \u221a(4\u00b2 - 2\u00b2) = \u221a12 = 2\u221a3. \n* **DQ:** Since OPDQ is a rectangle, DQ = OP = 6.\n* **AD:** As mentioned earlier, AD = 4.\n* **AQ:** AQ = AD - DQ = 4 - 6 = -2. This negative value indicates that Q lies to the left of A.\n**4.  Calculating the Area**\nThe hexagon AOBCPD can be divided into two triangles (OAD and PBC) and a rectangle (OPDQ).\n* **Area of OAD:** (1/2) * OA * AD = (1/2) * 2 * 4 = 4\n* **Area of PBC:** (1/2) * PB * BC = (1/2) * 4 * 4 = 8 (since PB = PC = 4 and BC = 4)\n* **Area of OPDQ:**  OP * DQ = 6 * 6 = 36\n**5.  Total Area**\nThe total area of the hexagon is: 4 + 8 + 36 = **48**\n**Therefore, the area of the concave hexagon AOBCPD is 48 square units.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Identify Key Shapes**\n*  The hexagon $AOBCPD$ can be divided into two trapezoids: $AOBD$ and $BCPD$.\n*  Triangles $AOD$ and $BOC$ are right triangles.\n**2. Find Relevant Lengths**\n*  **OP:** Since the circles are externally tangent,  $OP = 2 + 4 = 6$.\n*  **AD and BC:** Since $\\overline{AD}$ and $\\overline{BC}$ are common external tangents, they are congruent.  Also,  $AO = 2$ and $DP = 4$, so right triangle $AOD$ is similar to right triangle $POD$ (AA Similarity).  Therefore, $\\frac{AD}{OD} = \\frac{AO}{OP}$.  Solving for $AD$, we get: \n   *  $AD = \\frac{AO \\cdot OD}{OP} = \\frac{2 \\cdot OD}{6} = \\frac{OD}{3}$.\n   *  Since $OD = OP + DP = 6 + 4 = 10$, then $AD = BC = \\frac{10}{3}$.\n**3. Calculate Areas**\n*  **Trapezoid AOBD:**  \n   *  Base 1 ($AB$) = $2 \\cdot 2 = 4$ (diameter of the smaller circle)\n   *  Base 2 ($OD$) = 10\n   *  Height ($AO$) = 2\n   *  Area = $\\frac{1}{2}(4 + 10)(2) = 14$\n*  **Trapezoid BCPD:**\n   *  Base 1 ($BC$) = $\\frac{10}{3}$\n   *  Base 2 ($PD$) = 4\n   *  Height ($CP$) = 4\n   *  Area = $\\frac{1}{2} (\\frac{10}{3} + 4)(4) = \\frac{44}{3}$\n*  **Hexagon AOBCPD:**\n   *  Area = Area of $AOBD$ + Area of $BCPD$ = $14 + \\frac{44}{3} = \\boxed{\\frac{86}{3}}$\n**Therefore, the area of concave hexagon $AOBCPD$ is $\\frac{86}{3}$.** \n",
        "**1.  Understanding the Geometry**\n* We have two circles, one with radius 2 (centered at O) and the other with radius 4 (centered at P).\n* The circles are externally tangent, meaning they touch at one point and don't overlap.\n*  Lines AD and BC are common external tangents, meaning they touch both circles but don't intersect the circles' interiors.\n* We need to find the area of the concave hexagon AOBCPD.\n**2. Key Properties**\n* **Tangents and Radii:**  A tangent line to a circle is perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency.  Therefore, OA is perpendicular to AD, OB is perpendicular to BC, PD is perpendicular to AD, and PC is perpendicular to BC.\n* **Similar Triangles:** Triangles OAD and PBC are similar (all corresponding angles are equal). This is because they share the same angles due to the perpendicular tangent lines.\n**3. Finding Important Lengths**\n* **OP:** The distance between the centers of the circles is the sum of their radii: OP = 2 + 4 = 6.\n* **OH:** Since OAD is a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem: OH\u00b2 + 2\u00b2 = AD\u00b2 (where OH is the perpendicular distance from O to AD). We also know that PH\u00b2 + 4\u00b2 = AD\u00b2 (similarly for triangle PBC).  Setting these equal to each other, we get OH\u00b2 + 4 = PH\u00b2 + 16.  Since OH + PH = 6, we can solve to find OH = 2 and PH = 4.\n* **AD and BC:** Now we can use the Pythagorean theorem in triangle OAD to find AD: AD\u00b2 = 2\u00b2 + 2\u00b2 = 8, so AD = BC = 2\u221a2.\n**4. Calculating Areas**\n* **Triangles OAD and PBC:** The area of each of these triangles is (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 2 * 2 = 2.\n* **Trapezoids AOBC and DPC:** Since the height of each trapezoid is 2, we can find the area as (1/2) * height * (base1 + base2): \n    * AOBC: (1/2) * 2 * (2 + 4) = 6\n    * DPC: (1/2) * 2 * (2 + 4) = 6\n**5. Finding the Total Area**\nThe area of the hexagon AOBCPD is the sum of the areas of its parts:\nArea = (2 * Area of OAD) + (2 * Area of AOBC) = 2 * 2 + 2 * 6 = **16** \n**Therefore, the area of concave hexagon AOBCPD is 16 square units.** \n",
        "Here's a step-by-step solution to find the area of hexagon $AOBCPD$:\n**1.  Understanding the Geometry**\n* **Tangents:** The lines  $\\overline{AD}$ and $\\overline{BC}$ are tangent to both circles, which means they form right angles with the radii at the points of tangency.\n* **Congruent Segments:**  Since tangents from a point to a circle are congruent, we have  $AO = BO = 2$ and $CP = DP = 4$.\n* **Right Triangles:**  Triangles $ADO$ and $BCO$ are right triangles.\n**2. Finding Key Lengths**\n* **OP:**  The distance between the centers of the circles is $OP = 2 + 4 = 6$. \n* **AD and BC:** Let $H$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $O$ to  $\\overline{AD}$.  Then,  triangle $OHD$ is a right triangle with $OD = 2$ and $OH = 6$ (since $OP = 6$ and $PH = 4$).  By the Pythagorean Theorem, $DH = \\sqrt{OH^2 - OD^2} = \\sqrt{6^2 - 2^2} = 4\\sqrt{2}$.  Since $AD = 2DH$, we have $AD = BC = 8\\sqrt{2}$.\n**3.  Calculating the Area**\n* **Area of Triangles:** The area of each right triangle is half the product of its legs.  Therefore:\n    * Area of $\\triangle AOD$ =  $\\frac{1}{2}(2)(4\\sqrt{2}) = 4\\sqrt{2}$\n    * Area of $\\triangle BOC$ =  $\\frac{1}{2}(2)(4\\sqrt{2}) = 4\\sqrt{2}$\n* **Area of Quadrilaterals:**  Quadrilaterals $AODP$ and $BOCP$ are each composed of a right triangle and a rectangle:\n    * Area of $AODP$ = Area of $\\triangle AOD$ + Area of rectangle $OHDP$ = $4\\sqrt{2} + (6)(4) = 24 + 4\\sqrt{2}$\n    * Area of $BOCP$ = Area of $\\triangle BOC$ + Area of rectangle $OHCP$ = $4\\sqrt{2} + (6)(4) = 24 + 4\\sqrt{2}$\n**4.  Final Calculation**\nThe area of the hexagon is the sum of the areas of the two quadrilaterals:\nArea of $AOBCPD$ = Area of $AODP$ + Area of $BOCP$ = $(24 + 4\\sqrt{2}) + (24 + 4\\sqrt{2}) = \\boxed{48 + 8\\sqrt{2}}$. \n"
