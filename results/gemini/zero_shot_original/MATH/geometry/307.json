Identify the Sides:**\n* **Opposite:**  We are given that $\\tan K = \\frac{15}{8}$. Since $\\tan K$ is the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side, the opposite side is $JL$ (the side opposite angle $K$).\n* **Adjacent:** The adjacent side to angle $K$ is $KL$, which is given as 8.\n**3.

Apply the Information**\n* We are given that $\\tan K = \\frac{15}{8}$.  This means the side opposite angle $K$ (which is $JL$) is 15 times some length, and the side adjacent to angle $K$ (which is $KL$) is 8 times that same length.\n**3.  Use the Given Side Length**\n* We know $KL = 8$.  Since $KL$ is the adjacent side, we can deduce that the \"some length\" we mentioned in step 2 is 1. \n**4.  Find JL**\n* Since $JL$ is the opposite side and is 15 times the \"some length,\" we have $JL = 15 \\cdot 1 = \\boxed{15}$. \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand Tangent**\n*  In a right triangle, the tangent of an acute angle is defined as the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle. \n**2. Apply the Information**\n* We are given that $\\tan K = \\frac{15}{8}$. This means that the side opposite angle $K$ (which is $JL$) is 15 times longer than the side adjacent to angle $K$ (which is $KL$).\n**3. Set Up a Proportion**\n* Since we know $KL = 8$, we can set up a proportion:\n   ```\n   JL / KL = 15 / 8 \n   ```\n**4. Solve for JL**\n* Substitute the value of $KL$:\n   ```\n   JL / 8 = 15 / 8\n   ```\n* Multiply both sides by 8 to isolate $JL$:\n   ```\n   JL = (15/8) * 8\n   ```\n* Simplify:\n   ```\n   JL = 15\n   ```\n**Answer:** Therefore, the length of $JL$ is $\\boxed{15}$. \n",
