        "Here's a step-by-step solution:\n**1. Visualize the Problem**\nImagine a square with sides of length 2.  The line segments in set $\\cal S$ connect points on adjacent sides of the square, forming diagonals of smaller squares within the larger square.\n[asy]\nunitsize(1 cm);\npair A, B, C, D, P, Q, R, S;\nA = (0,0);\nB = (2,0);\nC = (2,2);\nD = (0,2);\nP = (0,1);\nQ = (1,0);\nR = (2,1);\nS = (1,2);\ndraw(A--B--C--D--cycle);\ndraw(P--R);\ndraw(Q--S);\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, SW);\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, SE);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, NE);\nlabel(\"$D$\", D, NW);\nlabel(\"$P$\", P, W);\nlabel(\"$Q$\", Q, S);\nlabel(\"$R$\", R, E);\nlabel(\"$S$\", S, N);\n[/asy]\n**2. Find the Midpoints**\nThe midpoints of the line segments in set $\\cal S$ lie on the diagonals of the square. Since the sides of the square are length 2, the diagonals have length $2\\sqrt{2}$.  Therefore, the midpoints are $\\sqrt{2}$ units away from each corner of the square.\n**3. Identify the Enclosed Region**\nThe midpoints of the line segments form a smaller square within the original square.

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Problem**\nImagine a square with side length 2. Now consider all the line segments of length 2 that have endpoints on adjacent sides of the square.  These line segments will form a variety of angles with the sides of the square.\n**2.  Focus on the Midpoints**\nThe problem asks about the region enclosed by the midpoints of these line segments.  Let's think about what this region looks like.\n* **Symmetry:**  Because of the symmetry of the square, the region enclosed by the midpoints will also be symmetrical. \n* **Shape:**  The midpoints will trace out a curve that resembles a rounded square, or perhaps a slightly distorted octagon.\n**3.  Finding the Key Shape**\nTo find the area of this region, we need to understand its shape more precisely.  Let's focus on one quadrant of the square:\n* **A Quadrant:** Consider the top-right quadrant of the square.  Imagine a line segment of length 2 with one endpoint on the top side and the other on the right side of the square.  As this segment moves along the top and right sides, its midpoint traces a curve.\n* **The Curve:** This curve is actually part of a circle!  Think about it: the midpoint is always 1 unit away from both sides of the square (half the length of the segment). This means the midpoint stays 1 unit away from the corner of the square, which is the center of a circle with radius 1.\n**4.  The Full Region**\nSince this pattern applies to each quadrant of the square, the entire region enclosed by the midpoints is formed by four quarter-circles, each with radius 1.  In other words, the region is a circle with radius 1.\n**5.  Calculate the Area**\nThe area of a circle is given by the formula:  Area = \u03c0 * radius\u00b2 \nIn this case, the area is: \u03c0 * 1\u00b2 = \u03c0 \n**6.  Find 100k**\nThe area of the region is \u03c0, and we need to find 100k where k is the area rounded to the nearest hundredth.  Since \u03c0 \u2248 3.14, rounded to the nearest hundredth,  k = 3.14. \nTherefore, 100k = 100 * 3.14 = **314** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Situation**\nImagine a square with sides of length 2. Now, picture line segments of length 2 that connect points on adjacent sides of the square. These line segments can be positioned in many ways, creating a range of possibilities.\n**2.  Understand the Midpoints**\nThe problem asks about the midpoints of these line segments.  As you imagine different line segments of length 2, notice that their midpoints will trace out a curve.  This curve will be the boundary of the region we're interested in.\n**3. Determine the Shape of the Enclosed Region**\nThe curve formed by the midpoints will be a **circle**.  Here's why:\n* **Fixed Distance:**  Every point on the curve is the midpoint of a line segment of length 2. This means every point on the curve is exactly 1 unit away from the center of the square (the midpoint of the square).\n* **Definition of a Circle:** A circle is defined as all points that are a fixed distance from a center point.\n**4. Calculate the Area of the Circle**\n* **Radius:** The radius of the circle is 1 (the distance from the center of the square to any point on the curve).\n* **Area of a Circle:** The area of a circle is given by the formula  \u03c0r\u00b2, where r is the radius.\n* **Area:** The area of the circle is \u03c0(1)\u00b2 = \u03c0.\n**5. Approximate and Multiply**\n* **Approximation:** \u03c0 is approximately 3.14.\n* **Multiply by 100:** 100k = 100 * 3.14 = 314\n**Therefore, 100k = 314** \n",
        "Here's a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n**1. Visualize the Problem**\nImagine a square with sides of length 2.  The line segments in set $\\cal S$ can be visualized as diagonals of smaller squares that fit inside the larger square. \n**2.  Find the Range of Slopes**\n* The line segments in $\\cal S$ can have slopes ranging from 0 (horizontal) to infinity (vertical).\n**3.  Consider a Specific Slope**\n* Let's focus on the line segments with a specific slope, say 1.  \n*  These line segments will form a diagonal of a smaller square that is rotated 45 degrees.  The smaller square has sides of length $\\sqrt{2}$ (using the Pythagorean Theorem).\n**4.  Find the Midpoint**\n* The midpoint of this diagonal will be the center of the smaller square.  \n**5.  Generalize for All Slopes**\n* The same logic applies to line segments with any slope.  The midpoint of each line segment in $\\cal S$ will be the center of a smaller square that fits within the larger square.\n**6.  The Enclosed Region**\n* As the slope of the line segments in $\\cal S$ varies, the centers of the smaller squares will trace out a shape. This shape will be the region enclosed by the midpoints of the line segments.\n**7.  The Shape of the Enclosed Region**\n* This shape is actually an inscribed circle within the larger square. To see this, consider the line segments with slopes of 0 and infinity \u2013 their midpoints will be the centers of the sides of the larger square.  Connecting these midpoints will form the diameter of the circle.\n**8.  Calculate the Area**\n* The diameter of the circle is equal to the side length of the square, which is 2.  \n* The radius is 1.\n* The area of the circle is $\\pi r^2 = \\pi (1)^2 = \\pi$.\n**9.  The Answer**\n* Therefore, $k = \\pi$, and $100k = 100\\pi \\approx \\boxed{314.16}$. \n",
