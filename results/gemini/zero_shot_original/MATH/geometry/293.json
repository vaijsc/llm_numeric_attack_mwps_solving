    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Recall that increasing a quantity by $p\\%$ is equivalent to multiplying it by $1+p\\%$.   If the original length, width, and height are $l$, $w$, and $h$, respectively, then the new length, width, and height are $1.1l$, $1.1w$, and $1.1h$.  Therefore, the new volume is $(1.1l)(1.1w)(1.1h)=(1.1)^3(lwh)=1.331(lwh)$, which is 1.331 times greater than the original volume $lwh$.  Multiplication by 1.331 corresponds to an increase of $33.1\\%$, which to the nearest percent is $\\boxed{33\\%}$.\n\nNote: The identity  \\[\n(1+x)^3=1+3x+3x^2+x^3\n\\] with the substitution $x=0.1$ may be used to quickly calculate $1.1^3$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Original Volume:**\n* Let the original width be  *w*, the original length be *l*, and the original height be *h*.\n* The original volume is *V* = *w* *l* *h*.\n**2.  New Dimensions:**\n* The width is increased by 10%, so the new width is 1.1*w*.\n* The length is increased by 10%, so the new length is 1.1*l*.\n* The height is increased by 10%, so the new height is 1.1*h*.\n**3.  New Volume:**\n* The new volume is (1.1*w) * (1.1*l) * (1.1*h) = 1.331 * w * l * h \n**4.  Percent Increase:**\n* The increase in volume is 1.331 * V - V = 0.331 * V.\n* The percent increase is (0.331 * V / V) * 100% = 33.1%\n**Answer:** The percent increase in the volume of the prism is approximately **33%**. \n",

Original and New Dimensions:**\n* Let the original width, length, and height be  *w*, *l*, and *h*, respectively.\n* After the increase, the new dimensions are 1.1*w*, 1.1*l*, and 1.1*h*.\n**2. Original and New Volume:**\n* Original volume: *V* = *w* *l* *h*\n* New volume: *V'* = (1.1*w*) (1.1*l*) (1.1*h*) = 1.331 *w* *l* *h*\n**3. Percent Increase:**\n* Increase in volume: *V'* - *V* = 1.331 *w* *l* *h* - *w* *l* *h* = 0.331 *w* *l* *h*\n* Percent increase: [(Increase in volume) / (Original volume)] * 100% = (0.331 *w* *l* *h* / *w* *l* *h*) * 100% = 33.1%\n**Answer:** The percent increase in the volume of the prism is approximately **33%**. \n",
        "Let's say the original dimensions of the prism are width = *w*, length = *l*, and height = *h*.\n* **Original Volume:** The original volume of the prism is *w* * l * *h*.\n* **Increased Dimensions:**  Each dimension is increased by 10%, so the new dimensions are:\n    * Width: 1.1*w\n    * Length: 1.1*l\n    * Height: 1.1*h\n* **New Volume:** The new volume of the prism is (1.1*w) * (1.1*l) * (1.1*h) = 1.331 * w * l * h\n* **Percent Increase:** The percent increase is found by calculating:\n    *  [(New Volume - Original Volume) / Original Volume] * 100%\n    *  [(1.331 * w * l * h - w * l * h) / (w * l * h)] * 100%\n    *  (0.331 * w * l * h) / (w * l * h) * 100%\n    *  0.331 * 100% = 33.1%\nTherefore, the volume of the prism increases by approximately **33%**. \n",
