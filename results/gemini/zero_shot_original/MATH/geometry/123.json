    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Each spherical bead has volume \\[\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(3^3)=4\\cdot 3^2\\pi,\\] so the twenty-seven beads have total volume \\[4\\cdot 3^2\\pi \\cdot 27 = 4\\cdot 3^5 \\pi.\\]  Let the larger sphere have radius $r$ units, so we have \\[\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3 = 4\\cdot 3^5\\pi.\\]  Simplifying gives \\[r^3 = 3^6\\] or \\[r=3^2=\\boxed{9}.\\]",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the volume of one small sphere:**\n* The formula for the volume of a sphere is (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3, where r is the radius.\n*  The radius of each small sphere is 3 units.\n* Volume of one small sphere = (4/3)\u03c0(3)\u00b3 = 36\u03c0 cubic units.\n**2. Find the total volume of all small spheres:**\n* There are 27 small spheres.\n* Total volume = 27 * 36\u03c0 = 972\u03c0 cubic units.\n**3. Find the radius of the larger sphere:**\n* The total volume of the small spheres is equal to the volume of the larger sphere.\n* Let the radius of the larger sphere be R.\n* (4/3)\u03c0R\u00b3 = 972\u03c0 \n* R\u00b3 = (972\u03c0 * 3) / 4\u03c0\n* R\u00b3 = 729\n* R = \u00b3\u221a729 = 9 units\n**Therefore, the radius of the larger gold sphere is 9 units.** \n",
