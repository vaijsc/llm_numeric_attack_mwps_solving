    "solution": "The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that $m\\angle PQR$ is half the measure of arc $PR$. So the measure of angle $\\angle PQR$ depends only on the size of arc $PR$.  The seven given points are equally spaced around the circle, so they divide the circumference into seven congruent arcs.  Arc $PR$ could consist of one, two, three, four, or five of these pieces.  (Draw a few quick pictures if this is not immediately apparent; in particular, convince yourself that enclosing six pieces is not an option.)  Therefore there are only $\\boxed{5}$ different values for $m\\angle PQR$.",

        "Here's how to break down the problem:\n**1. Understanding the Setup**\n* We have a circle with 7 points evenly spaced around it.  Imagine these points like the corners of a regular heptagon (a 7-sided polygon).\n* We want to find all the possible angle measures we can get when we pick any three of these points and form an angle.\n**2. Finding the Central Angle**\n* Since the points are equally spaced, the central angle formed by connecting any two adjacent points to the center of the circle is 360 degrees / 7 points = 51 3/7 degrees.\n**3. Types of Angles**\n* **Adjacent Points:** If we pick points that are next to each other on the circle, the angle will be the same as the central angle: 51 3/7 degrees.\n* **Non-Adjacent Points:** If we pick points that are not next to each other, the angle will be a multiple of the central angle.  For example, if we pick points that are two points apart, the angle will be 2 * (51 3/7) degrees = 102 6/7 degrees.\n**4. Possible Angles**\n* Since there are 7 points, the maximum number of points we can skip when forming an angle is 6 (we can't skip 7 because that would bring us back to the starting point).\n* Therefore, the possible angle measures are:\n    * 51 3/7 degrees \n    * 102 6/7 degrees\n    * 154 2/7 degrees\n    * 205 5/7 degrees\n    * 257 1/7 degrees\n    * 308 4/7 degrees\n**5.  Final Answer**\nThere are **6** different possible values for  m\u2220PQR. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understanding the Setup**\nImagine a circle with seven points equally spaced around it. We want to find how many different angle measurements we can get by choosing any three points and forming a triangle.\n**2. Types of Angles**\n* **Central Angles:**  Angles formed by connecting two points on the circle to the center of the circle. Since the points are equally spaced, all central angles formed by two consecutive points are equal.  \n* **Inscribed Angles:** Angles formed by connecting three points on the circle. \n**3. Relating Central and Inscribed Angles**\nA key theorem states: An inscribed angle is half the measure of its corresponding central angle.\n**4. Finding Possible Angle Measures**\n* **Central Angles:** Since there are 7 points, there are 7 central angles. The measure of each central angle is 360 degrees / 7 points = 51.43 degrees (approximately).  \n* **Inscribed Angles:**  Because inscribed angles are half of central angles, we can find the possible inscribed angle measures:\n    * Half of a central angle: 51.43 degrees / 2 = 25.71 degrees (approximately)\n    * Half of two consecutive central angles: 51.43 degrees * 2 / 2 = 51.43 degrees (approximately)\n    * Half of three consecutive central angles: 51.43 degrees * 3 / 2 = 77.14 degrees (approximately)\n    * And so on...\n**5.  Determining the Number of Unique Angle Measures**\nNotice that we can keep adding half of a central angle to get more possible inscribed angle measures. However, there will be a point where the angle measure becomes greater than 180 degrees (since angles in a triangle cannot exceed 180 degrees).  \n* **Maximum Angle:** The largest possible inscribed angle will be formed by connecting three consecutive points, which is half of three consecutive central angles (approximately 77.14 degrees).\n* **Unique Angle Measures:** We can form unique inscribed angles by taking half of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 consecutive central angles.  \n**Answer:** There are **6** different possible values for  $m\\angle PQR$. \n",
        "Here's how to break down the problem:\n**1. Understanding the Setup**\n* Imagine a circle with seven points evenly spaced around it. Think of these points like the numbers on a clock face, but with seven numbers instead of twelve.\n* We're choosing any three of these points (let's call them P, Q, and R) to form a triangle.\n**2. Finding the Possible Angle Measures**\n* **Central Angle:** The central angle of a regular heptagon (7-sided polygon) is 360\u00b0/7.\n* **Interior Angle:**  Each interior angle of a regular heptagon is (7-2) * 180\u00b0 / 7 = 128.57\u00b0 (approximately).\n* **Triangle Angles:**  Since we're forming triangles with the points on the circle, the possible angles within the triangle are determined by how many points are between the vertices of the triangle. \n**3. Analyzing the Cases**\nLet's consider the different arrangements of P, Q, and R based on how many points lie between them:\n* **Case 1: Zero points between P and Q, zero points between Q and R** \n   * This forms a triangle where the angle at Q is the interior angle of the heptagon (128.57\u00b0).\n* **Case 2: One point between P and Q, zero points between Q and R**\n   *  The angle at Q is formed by two consecutive central angles of the heptagon (2 * 360\u00b0/7 = 102.86\u00b0).\n* **Case 3: One point between P and Q, one point between Q and R**\n   * The angle at Q is formed by three consecutive central angles of the heptagon (3 * 360\u00b0/7 = 154.29\u00b0).\n* **Case 4: Two points between P and Q, zero points between Q and R**\n   * The angle at Q is formed by four consecutive central angles of the heptagon (4 * 360\u00b0/7 = 205.71\u00b0).\n**4. Additional Considerations**\n* **Symmetry:** Due to symmetry, we can switch the positions of P and R without changing the angle at Q. \n* **Repetition:** Some of these angle measures will repeat depending on the arrangement of P, Q, and R. For example, the angle at Q will be the same if there's one point between Q and R and one point between R and P.\n**5. Counting the Distinct Angles**\nBy analyzing the cases and considering symmetry, we find the following distinct possible angle measures for \u2220PQR:\n* 128.57\u00b0\n* 102.86\u00b0\n* 154.29\u00b0\n* 205.71\u00b0 \n**Therefore, there are 4 different possible values for \u2220PQR.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step by step:\n**1.  Visualize the Situation**\nImagine a circle with seven points marked equally around it.  \n**2.  Consider the Types of Angles**\n* **Central Angle:** An angle formed by connecting two of the points to the center of the circle.  \n* **Inscribed Angle:** An angle formed by connecting three of the points on the circle.  \n**3.  Central Angles and Their Measures**\nSince the points are equally spaced, the central angle formed by connecting any two consecutive points is 360 degrees / 7 points = 51.43 degrees (approximately).\n**4.  Inscribed Angles and Their Measures**\n* **Theorem:** The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.\n* **Applying the Theorem:** \n    * If the points P, Q, and R are consecutive, then angle PQR intercepts an arc of 51.43 degrees, and so angle PQR measures 51.43/2 = 25.71 degrees (approximately).\n    * If the points P, Q, and R are not consecutive, then angle PQR intercepts an arc of a multiple of 51.43 degrees.  For example, if PQR skips one point, the arc measures 2 * 51.43 = 102.86 degrees, and angle PQR measures 102.86/2 = 51.43 degrees (approximately).\n**5.  Possible Values**\nSince we can choose any three points, we can have different multiples of the central angle (51.43 degrees) intercepted by the inscribed angle.  This means the possible measures for angle PQR are:\n* 25.71 degrees\n* 51.43 degrees\n* 77.14 degrees\n* 102.86 degrees\n* 128.57 degrees\n* 154.29 degrees\n**6.  Counting the Distinct Values**\nThere are **six** distinct possible values for the measure of angle PQR. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understanding the Setup**\nImagine a circle with seven points evenly spaced around its circumference.  We want to find all the different possible angles we can create by choosing three of these points as the vertices of a triangle.\n**2. Finding the Central Angle**\nSince the points are equally spaced, the central angle formed by connecting any two adjacent points is 360 degrees / 7 points = 51.43 degrees (approximately).\n**3. Types of Angles**\nNow, consider the possible angles formed by choosing three points:\n* **Angles formed by adjacent points:** If we choose three consecutive points (P, Q, R), the angle  \u2220PQR will be equal to the central angle, which is approximately 51.43 degrees.\n* **Angles formed by non-adjacent points:** If we choose points that aren't consecutive, we can create angles that are multiples of the central angle. \n**4. Calculating Possible Angles**\n* We can have angles of 51.43 degrees (one central angle).\n* We can have angles of 102.86 degrees (two central angles).\n* We can have angles of 154.29 degrees (three central angles).\n* We can have angles of 205.71 degrees (four central angles). \n* We can have angles of 257.14 degrees (five central angles).\n* We can have angles of 308.57 degrees (six central angles).\n**5. Accounting for Symmetry**\nNotice that angles like 102.86 degrees and 257.14 degrees are just reflections of each other across a diameter of the circle.  The same is true for other pairs of angles.  This means we only need to consider the angles up to 180 degrees.\n**6. Final Count**\nTherefore, there are **three** different possible values for  \u2220PQR: 51.43 degrees, 102.86 degrees, and 154.29 degrees. \n"
