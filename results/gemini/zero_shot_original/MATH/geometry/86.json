    "solution": "Triangles WXY and BXY are isosceles triangles that have a leg in common, so they are congruent.  Therefore segment $YB$ is equal to a diagonal of square $WXYZ$, so its length is 12 units. By adding point $D$, as shown, we can see that triangles $CDY$ and $YXB$ are similar to triangle $CAB$. This also means that triangle $CDY$ is similar to triangle $YXB$. Since the sides of two similar triangles are related by a constant factor, and we can see that the length of $DY$ is 1/2 the length of $XB$, we know that the length of $CY$ must be $(1/2)(12) = 6$ units. Thus, the length of CB is $12 + 6 = \\boxed{18\\text{ units}}$.

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the side length of the square:**\n* Since the diagonal of a square divides it into two 45-45-90 right triangles, we can use the special ratio of sides in a 45-45-90 triangle.\n* The ratio is 1:1:\u221a2.  Since the diagonal (hypotenuse) is 12 units, the side length of the square is 12/\u221a2 = 6\u221a2 units.\n**2. Find the length of WA:**\n* Point A is the midpoint of WX, so WA = WX/2 = (6\u221a2)/2 = 3\u221a2 units.\n**3. Find the length of AB and AC:**\n*  Triangle ABC is a 45-45-90 triangle (since AB=AC and angle BAC is a right angle).\n*  We know WA = 3\u221a2, and since A is the midpoint of WX, WA = AX. \n*  Triangle WAX is also a 45-45-90 triangle, so WX = WA\u221a2 = 3\u221a2 * \u221a2 = 6.\n*  Therefore, AB = AC = WX/2 = 6/2 = 3 units.\n**4. Find the length of BC:**\n* We can use the Pythagorean Theorem on triangle ABC:\n   * BC\u00b2 = AB\u00b2 + AC\u00b2\n   * BC\u00b2 = 3\u00b2 + 3\u00b2 = 18\n   * BC = \u221a18 = 3\u221a2 units\n**Therefore, the length of segment BC is 3\u221a2 units.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the side length of the square:**\n* Since the diagonal of the square is 12, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem or the fact that the diagonal of a square is $\\sqrt{2}$ times the side length. \n* Let $s$ be the side length of the square. Then, $s\\sqrt{2} = 12$.\n* Solving for $s$, we get $s = \\frac{12}{\\sqrt{2}} = 6\\sqrt{2}$.\n**2. Find the length of WA:**\n* Since $A$ is the midpoint of $WX$, $WA = \\frac{1}{2}WX = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 6\\sqrt{2} = 3\\sqrt{2}$.\n**3. Recognize the special triangle:**\n* Triangle $ABC$ is a 45-45-90 right triangle because $AB = AC$ and angle $BAC$ is a right angle.\n**4. Find the length of AB and AC:**\n* In a 45-45-90 triangle, the hypotenuse is $\\sqrt{2}$ times the length of each leg.\n* Since $WA$ is one leg of triangle $ABC$, we have $AB = AC = WA/\\sqrt{2} = (3\\sqrt{2})/\\sqrt{2} = 3$.\n**5. Find the length of BC:**\n* We can use the Pythagorean Theorem on triangle $ABC$. \n* $BC^2 = AB^2 + AC^2 = 3^2 + 3^2 = 18$.\n* Therefore, $BC = \\sqrt{18} = \\boxed{3\\sqrt{2}}$. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Finding the side length of the square:**\n* Since the diagonal of the square is 12 units, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the side length. \n* Let the side length of the square be *s*.  The diagonal divides the square into two 45-45-90 right triangles.\n* Applying the Pythagorean theorem:  *s\u00b2 + s\u00b2 = 12\u00b2*\n* Simplifying: *2s\u00b2 = 144*\n* Solving for *s*: *s\u00b2 = 72* , so *s = \u221a72 = 6\u221a2*\n**2. Finding the length of WA and AX:**\n* Point A is the midpoint of WX, so WA = AX = (1/2) * 6\u221a2 = 3\u221a2.\n**3. Finding the length of AB and AC:**\n*  We are given that AB = AC.  Let's call this length *x*. \n**4. Using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle ABC:**\n* Triangle ABC is a right triangle.\n* Applying the Pythagorean theorem: *x\u00b2 + x\u00b2 = BC\u00b2*\n* Simplifying: *2x\u00b2 = BC\u00b2*\n**5. Relating triangle ABC to triangle WAX:**\n* Triangle WAX is also a right triangle.\n* Notice that WA = AX and AB = AC, so triangles WAX and ABC are similar (by SAS similarity).\n**6. Using similarity to find BC:**\n* Since the triangles are similar, the ratios of corresponding sides are equal: *BC/WA = AC/AX*\n* Substituting known values: *BC / (3\u221a2) = x / (3\u221a2)*\n* Simplifying: *BC = x*\n**7. Solving for BC:**\n* We found that *2x\u00b2 = BC\u00b2* and *BC = x*.\n* Substituting *x* for *BC*:  *2x\u00b2 = x\u00b2*\n* Solving for *x*: *x\u00b2 = 0*\n* Therefore, *x = 0*.  This means *BC = x = 0*.\n**However, this solution is not realistic since the length of a segment cannot be 0.  We must have made an error in our reasoning.**\n**Error Analysis:**\nThe error lies in assuming that triangles WAX and ABC are similar.  While they share two equal sides, the angles are not necessarily equal.  We cannot assume that angle BAC is a right angle without additional information.\n**Conclusion:**\nWe cannot determine the length of BC with the given information. The information provided is insufficient to determine the angles of triangle ABC. \n",

So, the side length of the square is 12/\u221a2 = 6\u221a2 units.\n**2. Find the length of WA:**\n* Point A is the midpoint of WX, so WA = WX/2 = (6\u221a2)/2 = 3\u221a2 units.\n**3. Find the length of AB and AC:**\n* Triangle ABC is a 45-45-90 triangle because AB = AC and angle BAC is a right angle.\n* Since WA = 3\u221a2 units and AB is perpendicular to WA, AB is the altitude of triangle WAB.  \n* Triangle WAB is also a 45-45-90 triangle.
