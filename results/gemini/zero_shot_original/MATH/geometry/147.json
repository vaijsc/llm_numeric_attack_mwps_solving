        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Parallelogram**\nImagine parallelogram ABCD.  Since AB is horizontal, and BC is a diagonal, CD must also be horizontal.  This means point D will have the same y-coordinate as point C.\n**2.  Find the Vector Representing AB**\nThe vector representing side AB is  (2 - 0, 1 - 1) = (2, 0).  \n**3.  Use Vector Addition**\nSince opposite sides of a parallelogram are parallel and equal in length, vector CD will also be (2, 0).  \n**4.  Find Point D**\n* Start at point C (4, 0)\n* Add the components of vector CD: (4 + 2, 0 + 0) = (6, 0)\n**5.  Calculate the Sum of Coordinates**\nThe sum of the coordinates of point D (6, 0) is 6 + 0 = **6**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand Parallelograms**\n* **Opposite sides are parallel and equal in length.**\n* **Diagonals bisect each other.**\n**2. Find the Missing Vertex**\n* **Use the midpoint property:** The midpoint of diagonal AC must be the same as the midpoint of diagonal BD.\n* **Find the midpoint of AC:**  [(0+4)/2, (1+0)/2] = (2, 1/2)\n* **Since B is (2, 1), the midpoint is already the y-coordinate of D.  So, D must have a y-coordinate of 1/2.**\n* **Since D is opposite A,  the x-coordinate of D must be the same as the x-coordinate of C plus the difference between the x-coordinates of B and A (2 - 0 = 2).**  So, the x-coordinate of D is 4 + 2 = 6.\n**3. The Solution**\n* **The coordinates of D are (6, 1/2).**\n* **The sum of the coordinates is 6 + 1/2 = 13/2.** \n**Therefore, the sum of the coordinates of point D is 13/2.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Parallelogram**\nSketch a quick diagram of the parallelogram. You'll see that side AB is parallel to side CD, and side BC is parallel to side AD.\n**2. Find the Vector for Side AB**\nThe vector representing side AB is found by subtracting the coordinates of A from the coordinates of B:  (2, 1) - (0, 1) = (2, 0).\n**3. Find the Coordinates of Point D**\nSince AB and CD are parallel, the vector representing side CD will also be (2, 0).  Start at point C (4, 0) and add the vector (2, 0) to find the coordinates of D: (4, 0) + (2, 0) = (6, 0).\n**4. Calculate the Sum of the Coordinates of Point D**\nThe sum of the coordinates of point D is 6 + 0 = **6**. \n",
