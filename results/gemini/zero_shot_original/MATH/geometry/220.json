        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Setup**\n* We have an equilateral triangle with sides of 12 cm.\n* We rotate this triangle around one of its altitudes. This creates a cone.\n* The altitude of the triangle becomes the height of the cone.\n* The base of the triangle becomes the circumference of the cone's base.\n**2. Find the Altitude of the Triangle**\n* An equilateral triangle can be divided into two 30-60-90 right triangles.\n* The altitude of the equilateral triangle is the longer leg of the 30-60-90 triangle.\n* In a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1:\u221a3:2.\n* Since the hypotenuse of our 30-60-90 triangle is 12 cm, the longer leg (altitude) is 12\u221a3 / 2 = 6\u221a3 cm.\n**3. Find the Radius of the Cone's Base**\n* The circumference of the cone's base is equal to the side length of the original triangle (12 cm).\n* Circumference = 2\u03c0r \n* 12 = 2\u03c0r\n* r = 12/(2\u03c0) = 6/\u03c0 cm\n**4. Calculate the Cone's Volume**\n* Volume of a cone = (1/3)\u03c0r\u00b2h\n* Volume = (1/3)\u03c0(6/\u03c0)\u00b2(6\u221a3)\n* Volume = (1/3)\u03c0(36/\u03c0\u00b2)(6\u221a3)\n* Volume = 72\u221a3/\u03c0  cubic centimeters\n**Therefore, the volume of the cone is 72\u221a3/\u03c0 cubic centimeters.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the height of the equilateral triangle:**\n* Draw an altitude from one vertex of the triangle to the opposite side. This altitude bisects the base and forms a 30-60-90 right triangle.\n* The hypotenuse of this right triangle is a side of the equilateral triangle (12 cm). \n* The shorter leg of the right triangle is half the hypotenuse (6 cm).\n* The longer leg of the right triangle is the altitude (\u221a3 times the shorter leg, or 6\u221a3 cm).\n**2.  Identify the cone's dimensions:**\n* The base of the cone is a circle with a radius equal to half the base of the triangle (6 cm).\n* The height of the cone is equal to the altitude of the triangle (6\u221a3 cm).\n**3. Calculate the volume of the cone:**\n* The volume of a cone is given by the formula: (1/3)\u03c0r\u00b2h\n* Substitute the values: (1/3)\u03c0(6\u00b2)(6\u221a3) = 72\u03c0\u221a3 cubic centimeters.\n**Therefore, the volume of the cone is 72\u03c0\u221a3 cubic centimeters.** \n",

The altitude of the triangle is the height of the cone:**\n* When the triangle is rotated, the altitude becomes the height of the cone. So, the height of the cone is 6\u221a3 cm.\n**3. The base of the triangle becomes the diameter of the cone's base:**\n* The base of the triangle becomes the diameter of the cone's base. So, the diameter of the base is 12 cm, and the radius is 12/2 = 6 cm.\n**4. Calculate the volume of the cone:**\n* The volume of a cone is given by (1/3)\u03c0r\u00b2h, where r is the radius of the base and h is the height.\n* Substitute the values we found: (1/3)\u03c0(6\u00b2)(6\u221a3) = 72\u03c0\u221a3 cubic centimeters.\n**Therefore, the volume of the cone is 72\u03c0\u221a3 cubic centimeters.** \n",
