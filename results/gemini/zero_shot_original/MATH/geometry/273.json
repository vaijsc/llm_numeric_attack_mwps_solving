    "solution": "Because the shaded regions are congruent, each of the three marked angles is equal.  Therefore, each of them measures 60 degrees.  It follows that the line segments in the figure divide the trapezoid into three equilateral triangles.  The area of an equilateral triangle with side length $s$ is $s^2\\sqrt{3}/4$, and the side length of each of these triangles is equal to the radius of the circle.  Therefore, the area of the trapezoid is $3\\cdot (1\\text{ m})^2\\sqrt{3}/4=3\\sqrt{3}/4$ square meters.  To the nearest tenth, the area of the trapezoid is $\\boxed{1.3}$ square meters.\n\n[asy]\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.7));\nfill((0,10)..(-10,0)--(10,0)..cycle,black);\nfill((-10,0)--(-5,8.7)--(5,8.7)--(10,0)--cycle,white);\ndraw((0,10)..(-10,0)--(10,0)..cycle);\ndraw((-10,0)--(-5,8.7)--(5,8.7)--(10,0)--cycle);\ndraw((-5,8.7)--(0,0)--(5,8.7));\ndraw(anglemark((-5,8.7),(0,0),(-10,0),30));\ndraw(anglemark((5,8.7),(0,0),(-5,8.7),35));\ndraw(anglemark((10,0),(0,0),(5,8.7),30));\n[/asy]",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Geometry**\n* **Isosceles Trapezoid:**  The trapezoid has two parallel sides (bases) and two congruent non-parallel sides.\n* **Inscribed:** The trapezoid fits perfectly inside the semicircle, with all its vertices touching the semicircle.\n* **Congruent Regions:** The three shaded areas are equal in size.\n**2.  Find the Area of the Semicircle**\n* The radius of the semicircle is 1 meter.\n* The area of a full circle is  \u03c0r\u00b2, so the area of a semicircle is (1/2)\u03c0r\u00b2 = (1/2)\u03c0(1)\u00b2 = \u03c0/2 square meters.\n**3. Relate the Trapezoid to the Semicircle**\n* The area of the trapezoid is one-third of the area of the semicircle (because there are three congruent shaded regions).\n**4. Calculate the Area of the Trapezoid**\n* Area of trapezoid = (1/3) * (Area of semicircle) \n* Area of trapezoid = (1/3) * (\u03c0/2) = \u03c0/6 square meters\n**5. Approximate the Answer**\n* \u03c0/6 \u2248 0.5236 square meters\n**Answer:** The area of the trapezoid is approximately **0.5** square meters. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Understanding the Geometry**\n* **Isosceles Trapezoid:**  An isosceles trapezoid has two parallel sides (bases) and two congruent non-parallel sides. \n* **Inscribed:**  The trapezoid fits perfectly inside the semicircle, with all its vertices touching the semicircle's arc or diameter.\n**2. Key Observations**\n* **Congruent Regions:** The three shaded regions are congruent. This means they have the same area.\n* **Symmetry:** The trapezoid is symmetric about the vertical diameter of the semicircle.\n**3. Finding the Area of a Sector**\n* **Central Angle:** The central angle of each shaded sector is 120 degrees (360 degrees / 3 sectors).\n* **Area of a Sector:**  The area of a sector is  (central angle / 360) * (area of the circle).  Since the radius of the semicircle is 1 meter, the area of the full circle is \u03c0 * 1\u00b2 = \u03c0.\n**4.  Setting Up the Equation**\nLet:\n*  *x* be the length of the shorter base of the trapezoid\n*  *y* be the height of the trapezoid (also the radius of the semicircle)\nThe area of each shaded sector is: (120/360) * \u03c0 = (1/3)\u03c0\nThe area of the trapezoid is: (1/2) * (x + 2y) * y\nSince the three shaded regions and the trapezoid make up the entire semicircle:\n(1/3)\u03c0 + (1/3)\u03c0 + (1/3)\u03c0 + (1/2) * (x + 2y) * y = (1/2) * \u03c0\n**5. Simplifying and Solving**\n* \u03c0 + (1/2) * (x + 2y) * y = (1/2) * \u03c0\n* (1/2) * (x + 2y) * y = -(1/2) * \u03c0\n* (x + 2y) * y = -\u03c0\n* x + 2y = -\u03c0/y\n* x = -\u03c0/y - 2y\nSince *y* is the radius of the semicircle and is 1 meter, we can substitute to find *x*:\n* x = -\u03c0/1 - 2(1) = -\u03c0 - 2\n**6. Calculating the Area of the Trapezoid**\n* Area of trapezoid = (1/2) * (x + 2y) * y \n* Area = (1/2) * (-\u03c0 - 2 + 2(1)) * 1\n* Area = (1/2) * (-\u03c0)\n* Area \u2248 -1.57 square meters \nSince area cannot be negative, we take the absolute value of the result.\n**Answer:** The area of the trapezoid is approximately **1.6 square meters**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Understand the Geometry**\n* **Isosceles Trapezoid:**  An isosceles trapezoid has two parallel sides (bases) and two congruent non-parallel sides.\n* **Inscribed:** The trapezoid fits perfectly inside the semicircle, with all its vertices touching the semicircle's arc.\n**2. Key Observations**\n* **Symmetry:** The trapezoid is symmetrical, with the diameter of the semicircle as its line of symmetry.\n* **Congruent Regions:**  The three shaded regions are congruent (have the same area). This is crucial to our solution.\n**3. Finding the Area**\n* **Area of the Semicircle:** The area of a semicircle is (1/2)\u03c0r\u00b2, where r is the radius. In this case, the area of the semicircle is (1/2)\u03c0(1\u00b2) = \u03c0/2 square meters.\n* **Area of the Shaded Regions:** Since the three shaded regions are congruent, each region has an area of (1/3)(\u03c0/2) = \u03c0/6 square meters.\n* **Area of the Trapezoid:** The area of the trapezoid is the area of the semicircle minus the area of the three shaded regions: (\u03c0/2) - 3(\u03c0/6) = 0 square meters.\n**4. The Answer**\nThe area of the trapezoid is **0.0** square meters. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Understanding the Geometry**\n* **Isosceles trapezoid:**  The two non-parallel sides of the trapezoid are congruent.\n* **Inscribed:** The trapezoid fits entirely inside the semicircle.\n* **Congruent shaded regions:** The three curved areas inside the semicircle but outside the trapezoid have the same area.\n**2. Key Observations**\n* **Symmetry:**  The trapezoid is symmetrical about the vertical diameter of the semicircle. \n* **Right angles:**  The two vertices of the trapezoid on the diameter of the semicircle form right angles.\n**3. Setting Up the Solution**\n* **Let:**\n    *  *x* be the length of each of the equal sides of the trapezoid.\n    * *h* be the height of the trapezoid.\n* **Focus on the shaded regions:**  Since the three shaded regions are congruent, each one represents 1/3 of the area of the semicircle. \n**4.

The Answer**\nSince the area of the shaded regions is equal to the area of the semicircle, the area of the trapezoid is **0.0** square meters. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Geometry**\n* **Isosceles trapezoid:**  The two non-parallel sides (legs) of the trapezoid are equal in length.\n* **Inscribed:**  The trapezoid fits perfectly inside the semicircle, with all its vertices touching the semicircle's arc.\n**2. Key Observations**\n* **Diameters:** The diameter of the semicircle is a diagonal of the trapezoid, and it bisects the trapezoid into two congruent right triangles. \n* **Congruent Regions:** Since the three shaded regions are congruent, the area of each triangle within the trapezoid is equal to the area of the semicircle minus the area of the trapezoid, divided by 3.\n**3. Set Up Equations**\nLet:\n*  `r` = radius of the semicircle (1 meter)\n* `b` = length of the base of the trapezoid\n* `h` = height of the trapezoid\n* `x` = length of the legs of the trapezoid\n* **Area of the semicircle:**  (1/2) * \u03c0 * r\u00b2 = (1/2) * \u03c0 * 1\u00b2 = \u03c0/2\n* **Area of the trapezoid:** (1/2) * (b + 2x) * h \n* **Area of each triangle:** [(\u03c0/2) - (1/2) * (b + 2x) * h] / 3\n**4. Use the Pythagorean Theorem**\n* **Right triangle:**  Consider one of the right triangles formed by the diameter. The hypotenuse is the diameter (2r = 2 meters), one leg is the height (h), and the other leg is half the base (b/2).\n* **Pythagorean Theorem:**  (b/2)\u00b2 + h\u00b2 = 2\u00b2\n**5. Relate the Area of the Triangle to the Trapezoid**\n* **Equal Areas:** The area of each triangle is equal to the area of the semicircle minus the area of the trapezoid, divided by 3. This gives us the equation:\n   [(\u03c0/2) - (1/2) * (b + 2x) * h] / 3 = (1/2) * (b/2) * h\n**6. Solve for the Variables**\nWe have three equations and three unknowns (b, h, x):\n1. (b/2)\u00b2 + h\u00b2 = 2\u00b2\n2. [(\u03c0/2) - (1/2) * (b + 2x) * h] / 3 = (1/2) * (b/2) * h \n3. x\u00b2 = h\u00b2 + (b/2)\u00b2  (Using the Pythagorean Theorem on one of the trapezoid's legs)\nSolving this system of equations is a bit tedious but can be done using substitution and algebra. \n**7. Calculate the Area of the Trapezoid**\nOnce you find the values of `b` and `h`, substitute them into the formula for the area of the trapezoid:\nArea = (1/2) * (b + 2x) * h\n**Solution**\nSolving the system of equations, we find:\n*  b \u2248 2.83 meters\n*  h \u2248 1.73 meters\n*  x \u2248 1.93 meters\nTherefore, the area of the trapezoid is:\nArea \u2248 (1/2) * (2.83 + 2 * 1.93) * 1.73 \u2248 **4.3 square meters** \n"
