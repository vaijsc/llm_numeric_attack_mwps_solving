    "solution": "Applying the Triangle Inequality, we have that $(3p - 1) + (3p) > p^2 + 1,$ so $0 > p^2 - 6p + 2.$ We can find the values of $p$ that satisfy this inequality by completing the square.  Adding 7 to both sides gives $7 > p^2 - 6p + 9$, so $ 7 > (p-3)^2$.  Since $p$ must be a positive integer, the only possible values of $(p-3)^2$ are 0, 1, and 4.  Therefore, the possible values of $p$ are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Let's find $(3p - 1, 3p, p^2 + 1)$ for each possible $p$:\n\nIf $p = 1,$ then $(3p - 1, 3p, p^2 + 1) = (2, 3, 2).$\n\nIf $p = 2,$ then $(3p - 1, 3p, p^2 + 1) = (5, 6, 5).$\n\nIf $p = 3,$ then $(3p - 1, 3p, p^2 + 1) = (8, 9, 10).$\n\nIf $p = 4,$ then $(3p - 1, 3p, p^2 + 1) = (11, 12, 17).$\n\nIf $p = 5,$ then $(3p - 1, 3p, p^2 + 1) = (14, 15, 26).$\n\nAll of these look good, so we see that there are $\\boxed{5}$ possibilities for $p.$",

        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Triangle Inequality**\nFor a triangle to exist, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side. We need to check all three possible inequalities:\n* **Inequality 1:**  (3p - 1) + 3p > p\u00b2 + 1 \n* **Inequality 2:** (3p - 1) + (p\u00b2 + 1) > 3p\n* **Inequality 3:** 3p + (p\u00b2 + 1) > 3p - 1\n**2. Simplifying the Inequalities**\nLet's simplify each inequality:\n* **Inequality 1:** 6p - 1 > p\u00b2 + 1  =>  p\u00b2 - 6p + 2 < 0\n* **Inequality 2:** p\u00b2 + 3p > 0  => p(p + 3) > 0\n* **Inequality 3:** p\u00b2 + 2 > 0  (This inequality is always true for positive values of p)\n**3. Solving the Inequalities**\n* **Inequality 1:**  We need to find the values of p that satisfy the quadratic inequality p\u00b2 - 6p + 2 < 0.  We can use the quadratic formula to find the roots of p\u00b2 - 6p + 2 = 0:\n   p = (6 \u00b1 \u221a(6\u00b2 - 4 * 1 * 2)) / (2 * 1) = 3 \u00b1 \u221a7 \n   Since the coefficient of p\u00b2 is positive, the parabola opens upwards. The inequality holds true between the roots. Therefore,  3 - \u221a7 < p < 3 + \u221a7.\n* **Inequality 2:**  The inequality p(p + 3) > 0 is true when both p and p + 3 are positive, or when both are negative. This means p > 0 or p < -3.  Since we're looking for positive integer values of p, we only consider p > 0.\n* **Inequality 3:** This inequality is always true for positive values of p.\n**4. Finding the Integer Solutions**\nWe need to find the positive integers that satisfy both 3 - \u221a7 < p < 3 + \u221a7 and p > 0.  Since 3 - \u221a7 is approximately 0.35 and 3 + \u221a7 is approximately 5.65, the positive integers that satisfy these conditions are: \n* p = 1\n* p = 2\n* p = 3\n* p = 4\n* p = 5\n**5. Conclusion**\nTherefore, there are **5** positive integers p for which a triangle with sides of length 3p - 1, 3p, and p\u00b2 + 1 can exist. \n",

Solving the Inequalities**\n* **(1):**  To solve p\u00b2 - 6p + 2 < 0, we can use the quadratic formula:\n   p = (6 \u00b1 \u221a(6\u00b2 - 4 * 1 * 2)) / (2 * 1) = 3 \u00b1 \u221a7\n   Since we're looking for positive integers, the solution is  3 - \u221a7 < p < 3 + \u221a7. \n* **(2):** p(p + 3) > 0 has solutions p < -3 or p > 0.  Since we're looking for positive integers, p > 0 is our solution.\n**4. Finding the Intersection**\nWe need to find the integers that satisfy all three inequalities. The intersection of the solutions is:\n* 3 - \u221a7 < p < 3 + \u221a7  (from inequality (1))\n* p > 0 (from inequality (2))\nThe only positive integer that satisfies both inequalities is **p = 1**. \n**5.

We only need to focus on inequality 1.\nLet's solve the quadratic inequality p\u00b2 - 6p + 2 < 0.  We can use the quadratic formula to find the roots:\np = (6 \u00b1 \u221a(6\u00b2 - 4 * 1 * 2)) / (2 * 1) = (6 \u00b1 \u221a28) / 2 = 3 \u00b1 \u221a7\nThe roots are approximately 1.35 and 4.65.  Since the coefficient of the p\u00b2 term is positive, the parabola opens upwards. This means the inequality is true for values of *p* between the roots.\nTherefore, the solution to p\u00b2 - 6p + 2 < 0 is **1.35 < p < 4.65**.\nSince *p* must be a positive integer, the only possible values for *p* are **2, 3, and 4**.\nSo there are **3** positive integers *p* that satisfy the conditions. \n",

Solving the Inequalities**\n* **Inequality 1:** To solve p\u00b2 - 6p + 2 < 0, we can use the quadratic formula. The roots of the quadratic are p = 3 \u00b1 \u221a7.  The inequality holds true when p is between these roots: 3 - \u221a7 < p < 3 + \u221a7.\n* **Inequality 2:** The inequality p(p + 3) > 0 holds true when either both p and (p + 3) are positive, or both are negative.  This means p > 0 or p < -3. Since we are looking for positive integers, we consider p > 0.\n* **Inequality 3:** This inequality is always true.\n**4. Finding the Intersection**\nWe need to find the values of 'p' that satisfy all three inequalities.  The intersection of the solution sets for the inequalities is:\n3 - \u221a7 < p < 3 + \u221a7  and  p > 0\n**5. Counting the Integer Solutions**\nSince 3 - \u221a7 is approximately 0.35 and 3 + \u221a7 is approximately 5.65, the positive integers 'p' that satisfy the inequalities are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n**Therefore, there are 5 positive integers 'p' for which a triangle can be formed with sides of length 3p - 1, 3p, and p\u00b2 + 1.** \n",

We need to check all three possibilities:\n* **(3p - 1) + (3p) > (p\u00b2 + 1):** This simplifies to  6p - 1 > p\u00b2 + 1, which further simplifies to p\u00b2 - 6p + 2 < 0.\n* **(3p - 1) + (p\u00b2 + 1) > (3p):** This simplifies to p\u00b2 + 1 > 0, which is always true for positive values of *p*.\n* **(3p) + (p\u00b2 + 1) > (3p - 1):** This simplifies to p\u00b2 + 1 > -1, which is also always true for positive values of *p*.\n**2. Solving the Quadratic Inequality**\nWe need to solve the inequality p\u00b2 - 6p + 2 < 0.  We can use the quadratic formula to find the roots of the equation p\u00b2 - 6p + 2 = 0:\np = (6 \u00b1 \u221a(6\u00b2 - 4 * 1 * 2)) / (2 * 1) = 3 \u00b1 \u221a7\nThis tells us that the quadratic expression is negative between the roots 3 - \u221a7 and 3 + \u221a7. \n**3. Finding Integer Solutions**\nWe want to find the positive integer values of *p* that satisfy the inequality. Since 3 - \u221a7 is approximately 0.35 and 3 + \u221a7 is approximately 5.65, the only positive integer *p* that falls within this range is **p = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5**.\n**4. Checking for Validity**\nWe need to ensure that for each of these values of *p*, the Triangle Inequality holds for all three combinations of sides.  We've already seen that the last two inequalities always hold.  We just need to check the first inequality for each value of *p*:\n* **p = 1:** (3p - 1) + (3p) = 5 > 2 = (p\u00b2 + 1)  **Valid**\n* **p = 2:** (3p - 1) + (3p) = 11 > 5 = (p\u00b2 + 1)  **Valid**\n* **p = 3:** (3p - 1) + (3p) = 17 > 10 = (p\u00b2 + 1)  **Valid**\n* **p = 4:** (3p - 1) + (3p) = 23 > 17 = (p\u00b2 + 1)  **Valid**\n* **p = 5:** (3p - 1) + (3p) = 29 > 26 = (p\u00b2 + 1)  **Valid**\n**5. Conclusion**\nTherefore, there are **5** positive integers *p* for which a triangle with sides of length 3p - 1, 3p, and p\u00b2 + 1 can exist. \n"
