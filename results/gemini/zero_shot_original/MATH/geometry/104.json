        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the radius of the sphere:**\n* The diameter of the sphere is equal to the height of the box, which is 30 cm.\n* The radius of the sphere is half the diameter, so the radius is 30 cm / 2 = 15 cm.\n**2. Find the volume of the sphere:**\n* The formula for the volume of a sphere is (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3, where r is the radius.\n* Substitute the radius we found: (4/3)\u03c0(15 cm)\u00b3 = 4500\u03c0 cubic centimeters.\n**3. Find the volume of the cube:**\n* The formula for the volume of a cube is s\u00b3, where s is the side length.\n* Substitute the side length: (30 cm)\u00b3 = 27000 cubic centimeters.\n**4. Find the volume of the space not occupied by the sphere:**\n* Subtract the volume of the sphere from the volume of the cube: 27000 cubic centimeters - 4500\u03c0 cubic centimeters.\n**Answer:** The volume of the box not occupied by the sphere is **27000 - 4500\u03c0** cubic centimeters. \n",
