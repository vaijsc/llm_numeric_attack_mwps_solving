    "solution": "To begin, see that if the ratio of the height of the cone to the height of the cylinder is 1:2, then the ratio of the cone height to the entire silo height is 1:3.  Therefore, the height of the cone is $27/3=9$ meters and the height of the cylinder is $18$ meters.  We can now use the formulas for the volume of a cylinder and the volume of a cone, with our given radius of 5: $$V_{cone}=\\frac{1}{3}\\cdot b \\cdot h=\\frac{1}{3}\\cdot (\\pi\\cdot 5^2)\\cdot 9=75\\pi$$$$V_{cylinder}=\\pi r^2\\cdot h=\\pi 5^2\\cdot 18=450\\pi$$$$V_{silo}=V_{cone}+V_{cylinder}=75\\pi+450\\pi=\\boxed{525\\pi}.$$",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the dimensions of the cylinder:**\n* **Radius:** The diameter is 10 meters, so the radius is 10/2 = 5 meters.\n* **Height:**  The height of the entire silo is 27 meters, and the cone's height is half the cylinder's height.  Let  'x' represent the cylinder's height.  We have:  x + (x/2) = 27. Combining terms, we get (3/2)x = 27. Solving for x, we find the cylinder's height is x = 18 meters.\n**2. Find the volume of the cylinder:**\n* **Formula:** The volume of a cylinder is  \u03c0 * radius\u00b2 * height\n* **Calculation:**  \u03c0 * 5\u00b2 * 18 = 450\u03c0 cubic meters\n**3. Find the volume of the cone:**\n* **Formula:** The volume of a cone is (1/3) * \u03c0 * radius\u00b2 * height\n* **Height of the cone:** The cone's height is half the cylinder's height, so it's 18/2 = 9 meters.\n* **Calculation:** (1/3) * \u03c0 * 5\u00b2 * 9 = 75\u03c0 cubic meters\n**4. Find the total volume of the silo:**\n* **Add the volumes:** 450\u03c0 + 75\u03c0 = **525\u03c0 cubic meters** \n**Therefore, the volume of the silo is 525\u03c0 cubic meters.** \n",
