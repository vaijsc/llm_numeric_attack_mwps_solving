    "solution": "We may consider the diameter of circle $C$ as the base of the inscribed triangle; its length is $20\\text{ cm}$. Then the corresponding height extends from some point on the diameter to some point on the circle $C$. The greatest possible height is a radius of $C$, achieved when the triangle is right isosceles: [asy]\nunitsize(8);\ndraw(Circle((0,0),10));\ndraw(((-10,0)--(10,0)));\nlabel(\"$20$\",(0,0),S);\ndraw(((-10,-0.8)--(-0.8,-0.6)),BeginArrow);\ndraw(((0.8,-0.8)--(10,-0.8)),EndArrow);\ndraw(((-10,0)--(0,10)));\ndraw(((0,10)--(10,0)));\ndraw(((0,0)--(0,10)),dashed);\nlabel(\"$10$\",(0,2.5),E);\n[/asy] In this case, the height is $10\\text{ cm}$, so the area of the triangle is $$\\frac 12\\cdot 20\\cdot 10 = \\boxed{100}\\text{ square centimeters}.$$",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Problem**\nImagine a circle with a diameter drawn across it.  The largest possible inscribed triangle will have this diameter as its base, and its two other vertices will be points on the circle.\n**2. Understand the Shape**\nThe triangle formed is a right triangle. This is because the diameter of a circle subtends a right angle at any point on the circle's circumference.\n**3. Determine the Dimensions**\n* **Base:** The base of the triangle is the diameter of the circle, which is 20 cm.\n* **Height:** The height of the triangle is the radius of the circle, which is 10 cm.\n**4. Calculate the Area**\nThe area of a triangle is given by:\nArea = (1/2) * base * height\nSubstitute the values we found:\nArea = (1/2) * 20 cm * 10 cm = 100 cm\u00b2\n**Answer:** The area of the largest possible inscribed triangle is **100 square centimeters**. \n",

The largest possible inscribed triangle will have this diameter as its base and its two other vertices will touch the circle's circumference.\n**2. Identify the Triangle Type**\nThe triangle formed is a right triangle.  The diameter of the circle is also the hypotenuse of the triangle.\n**3.  Use the Properties of Right Triangles**\n* **Hypotenuse:** The diameter of the circle is 20 cm (twice the radius).\n* **Legs:**  The two legs of the right triangle are equal in length (since they are radii of the circle) and each is 10 cm long.\n**4. Calculate the Area**\n* **Base:** 20 cm\n* **Height:** 10 cm\nThe area of a triangle is (1/2) * base * height.\nArea = (1/2) * 20 cm * 10 cm = **100 square centimeters** \n",

The largest possible inscribed triangle will have this diameter as its base and its third vertex will be on the circle's circumference.\n**2. Understand the Triangle**\n* The triangle formed is an isosceles triangle. The two sides connecting the ends of the diameter to the third vertex are equal in length (radii of the circle).\n* The height of the triangle is also a radius of the circle.\n**3. Calculate the Area**\n* **Base:** The diameter of the circle is 20 cm.\n* **Height:** The radius of the circle is 10 cm.\nThe area of a triangle is (1/2) * base * height.  Therefore, the area of the largest possible inscribed triangle is:\n(1/2) * 20 cm * 10 cm = **100 square centimeters** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Problem**\nImagine a circle with a diameter drawn across it.  The largest possible inscribed triangle will use this diameter as one of its sides.  Since the triangle must be inside the circle, the other two vertices must lie on the circle's circumference.\n**2. Identify the Special Triangle**\nThe triangle formed will be a right triangle. This is because the diameter of a circle always creates a right angle when it intersects the circle's circumference. \n**3. Use the Diameter as the Base**\nThe diameter of the circle is 10 cm, so this will be the base of the triangle.\n**4. Find the Height**\nThe height of the triangle is the perpendicular distance from the vertex opposite the diameter to the diameter itself.  Since the vertex is on the circle, this height will be equal to the radius of the circle, which is 10 cm.\n**5. Calculate the Area**\nThe area of a triangle is given by:\n* Area = (1/2) * base * height\nSubstitute the values we found:\n* Area = (1/2) * 10 cm * 10 cm = 50 square centimeters\n**Answer:** The area of the largest possible inscribed triangle is **50 square centimeters**. \n",

The largest possible inscribed triangle will have this diameter as its base, and the two other vertices of the triangle will be at the ends of the diameter.\n**2. Understand the Shape**\nThe resulting triangle is an isosceles triangle. Since the diameter is also a side of the triangle, it's the base, and the two other sides are equal.\n**3. Use the Radius**\nThe radius of the circle is half the length of the diameter. Since the radius is 10 cm, the diameter (and the base of the triangle) is 20 cm.\n**4. Find the Height**\nThe height of the triangle is the perpendicular distance from the vertex opposite the base to the base.  Notice that this height is also a radius of the circle, so it's 10 cm.\n**5. Calculate the Area**\nThe area of a triangle is given by:\nArea = (1/2) * base * height\nArea = (1/2) * 20 cm * 10 cm \nArea = 100 square centimeters\n**Answer:** The area of the largest possible inscribed triangle is **100 square centimeters**. \n"
