    "problem": "A recipe for crispy rice treats results in a mixture that fills a 9-inch by 13-inch pan to a depth of one inch. If a crispy rice treats mixture resulting from 1.5 times the original recipe is poured into a pan that is 10 inches by 15 inches, to what depth, in inches, will the pan be filled?

    "solution": "The volume of crispy rice treats resulting from the original recipe is $9\\cdot 13\\cdot 1 = 117$ cubic inches.  Thus the volume obtained by making 1.5 times the original recipe is $1.5\\cdot 117 =175.5$ cubic inches.  So the depth to which the pan is filled is $\\frac{175.5}{10\\cdot 15} = \\boxed{1.17}$ inches.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Calculate the original volume:**\n* The original recipe fills a 9-inch by 13-inch pan to a depth of 1 inch.\n* The volume of the original recipe is 9 inches * 13 inches * 1 inch = 117 cubic inches.\n**2. Calculate the volume of the scaled-up recipe:**\n* The scaled-up recipe is 1.5 times the original recipe.\n* The volume of the scaled-up recipe is 1.5 * 117 cubic inches = 175.5 cubic inches.\n**3. Calculate the depth in the new pan:**\n* The new pan is 10 inches by 15 inches.\n* Let the depth of the mixture in the new pan be 'x' inches.\n* The volume of the mixture in the new pan is 10 inches * 15 inches * x inches = 150x cubic inches.\n**4. Set up an equation and solve for 'x':**\n* The volume of the scaled-up recipe must equal the volume of the mixture in the new pan.\n* 150x = 175.5\n* x = 175.5 / 150 = 1.17 inches (rounded to the nearest hundredth)\n**Answer:** The pan will be filled to a depth of **1.17 inches**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Calculate the volume of the original mixture:**\n* The original pan has a volume of 9 inches * 13 inches * 1 inch = 117 cubic inches.\n**2. Calculate the volume of the larger mixture:**\n* The larger mixture is 1.5 times the original, so it has a volume of 117 cubic inches * 1.5 = 175.5 cubic inches.\n**3. Calculate the depth in the larger pan:**\n* The larger pan has an area of 10 inches * 15 inches = 150 square inches.\n* The depth of the mixture in the larger pan is the volume divided by the area: 175.5 cubic inches / 150 square inches = 1.17 inches.\n**Therefore, the pan will be filled to a depth of approximately 1.17 inches.** \n",
