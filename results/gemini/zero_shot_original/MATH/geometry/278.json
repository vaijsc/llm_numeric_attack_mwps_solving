        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the radius of the glass:**\n* The circumference of a circle is given by the formula  C = 2\u03c0r, where C is the circumference and r is the radius.\n* We know the circumference is 3\u03c0 inches. \n* Substitute and solve for r: \n   3\u03c0 = 2\u03c0r\n   r = (3\u03c0) / (2\u03c0) = 3/2 inches\n**2. Calculate the volume of the cylinder:**\n* The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula V = \u03c0r\u00b2h, where r is the radius and h is the height.\n* We know r = 3/2 inches and h = 4 inches.\n* Substitute and solve for V:\n   V = \u03c0 (3/2)\u00b2 (4)\n   V = \u03c0 (9/4) (4)\n   V = **9\u03c0 cubic inches**\n**Therefore, the glass can hold 9\u03c0 cubic inches of liquid.** \n",
