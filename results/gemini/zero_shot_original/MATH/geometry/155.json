        "Here's how to compute $\\cos 45^\\circ$:\n**1. Visualize the Unit Circle:**\n* Imagine a circle with radius 1 centered at the origin of a coordinate plane.\n*  A 45-degree angle starts at the positive x-axis and rotates counterclockwise.\n**2. Identify the Point:**\n* The point where the angle intersects the unit circle will have coordinates (x, y).\n* In a 45-45-90 triangle, the legs are equal. Since the hypotenuse is 1, the legs (x and y) will each be $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n**3. Cosine is the x-coordinate:**\n*  The cosine of an angle is the x-coordinate of the point on the unit circle. \n*  Therefore, $\\cos 45^\\circ = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n**4. Rationalize the Denominator (optional):**\n* To get rid of the radical in the denominator, multiply by $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{2}}$:\n   $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$\n**Therefore, $\\cos 45^\\circ = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$ or $\\cos 45^\\circ = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$.** \n",

Find the Point on the Circle:**\n*  A $45^\\circ$ angle cuts the first quadrant in half. \n*  The point where the angle intersects the unit circle will have coordinates $(x,y)$ where both $x$ and $y$ are equal (since it's a 45-45-90 triangle).\n**3.  Apply the Definition of Cosine:**\n*  In the unit circle,  the cosine of an angle is the x-coordinate of the point where the angle intersects the circle.\n**4.  Calculate the Coordinates:**\n*  Since it's a 45-45-90 triangle, the hypotenuse is 1 (the radius of the unit circle), and the legs are equal.\n*  Using the Pythagorean theorem:  $x^2 + x^2 = 1^2$\n*  Solving for $x$: $2x^2 = 1$,  $x^2 = \\frac{1}{2}$,  $x = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n*  Rationalize the denominator: $x = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$\n**Therefore,  $\\cos 45^\\circ = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$** \n",
        "Here's how to compute cos 45\u00b0:\n**1. Visualize a Right Triangle**\n* Imagine a right triangle where the two legs (the sides that form the right angle) are equal in length. \n* This makes the triangle a 45-45-90 triangle (because the angles are 45\u00b0, 45\u00b0, and 90\u00b0).\n**2. Use the Pythagorean Theorem**\n* Let the length of each leg be 's'.\n* The hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) will have a length of 's\u221a2' (you can derive this using the Pythagorean theorem: a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2).\n**3. Recall the Definition of Cosine**\n* Cosine is defined as the adjacent side divided by the hypotenuse.\n**4. Calculate Cos 45\u00b0**\n* In our 45-45-90 triangle:\n    * Adjacent side = 's'\n    * Hypotenuse = 's\u221a2'\n* Therefore, cos 45\u00b0 = (adjacent side) / (hypotenuse) = s / (s\u221a2) = 1/\u221a2\n**5. Rationalize the Denominator**\n* To make the answer look neater, we can rationalize the denominator by multiplying both numerator and denominator by \u221a2:\n    * cos 45\u00b0 = (1/\u221a2) * (\u221a2/\u221a2) = \u221a2/2\n**Therefore, cos 45\u00b0 = \u221a2/2** \n",
