        "### Response:\nTo form a triangle, the Triangle Inequality Theorem must hold. This theorem states that the sum of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side.  Let's apply this to our problem:\n* **Case 1:**  5 + 6 > x  -->  11 > x \n* **Case 2:** 5 + x > 6  -->  x > 1\n* **Case 3:** 6 + x > 5  -->  x > -1 (This case is always true since x must be a positive length)\nCombining these inequalities, we get 1 < x < 11.  The possible integral values of x are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.\nThe sum of these values is 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = **54**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. The Triangle Inequality**\nThe Triangle Inequality states that the sum of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side.  We need to apply this to our triangle with sides 5, 6, and *x*:\n* **Case 1:** 5 + 6 > *x*  \n   This simplifies to *x* < 11\n* **Case 2:** 5 + *x* > 6\n   This simplifies to *x* > 1\n* **Case 3:** 6 + *x* > 5\n   This simplifies to *x* > -1 (This inequality is always true since *x* represents a side length, which must be positive).\n**2. Combining the Inequalities**\nWe need to find the values of *x* that satisfy all three inequalities:\n* *x* < 11\n* *x* > 1\n* *x* > -1 (always true)\nTherefore, the possible integer values of *x* are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.\n**3. Finding the Sum**\nThe sum of these possible values is: 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = **54** \n**Answer:** The sum of all possible integral values of *x* is **54**. \n",
