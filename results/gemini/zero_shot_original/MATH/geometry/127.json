        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n* We have an isosceles triangle PQR with equal sides PQ and QR.\n* A median is a line segment from a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side.  We want to find the length of median QM.\n**2. Apply the Median Theorem**\nThe Median Theorem states that the median to the base of an isosceles triangle bisects the vertex angle and is also perpendicular to the base.\n**3. Visualize the Situation**\n* Draw an isosceles triangle PQR with PQ = QR = 34 and PR = 32.\n* Draw the median QM from vertex Q to the midpoint M of PR.\n**4. Use the Pythagorean Theorem**\n* Since QM is perpendicular to PR, triangle PQM is a right triangle with right angle at M. \n* We know PM = MR = 16 (half of PR). \n* We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find QM:\n   QM\u00b2 = PQ\u00b2 - PM\u00b2 = 34\u00b2 - 16\u00b2 = 1080\n**5. Solve for QM**\n* Take the square root of both sides:  QM = \u221a1080 = 6\u221a30\n**Therefore, the length of median QM is 6\u221a30.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Understand Medians**\n* A median of a triangle is a line segment drawn from a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side.\n**2.  Apply the Median Theorem**\n* The Median Theorem states:  The sum of the squares of two sides of a triangle is equal to twice the square of the median drawn to the third side plus half the square of the third side. \n**3.  Set Up the Equation**\n* Let $M$ be the midpoint of $\\overline{PR}$.  We want to find $QM$.  Applying the Median Theorem to $\\triangle PQR$, we have:\n   \n   $PQ^2 + QR^2 = 2(QM)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}(PR)^2$\n**4.  Substitute and Solve**\n* Substitute the given values:\n   \n   $34^2 + 34^2 = 2(QM)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}(32)^2$\n* Simplify and solve for $QM$:\n   $2312 = 2(QM)^2 + 512$\n   $1800 = 2(QM)^2$\n   $900 = (QM)^2$\n   $QM = 30$\n**Therefore, the length of median $\\overline{QM}$ is 30.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step by step:\n**1. Understand Medians**\n* A median of a triangle is a line segment drawn from a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side.\n* In this case, median $\\overline{QM}$ goes from vertex $Q$ to the midpoint of side $\\overline{PR}$.\n**2. Use the Median Theorem**\n* The Median Theorem states that the length of a median is half the length of the side it bisects. \n**3. Apply the Theorem**\n* Since $\\overline{QM}$ bisects $\\overline{PR}$,  $PM = MR = \\frac{1}{2} PR = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 32 = 16$.\n**4. Visualize the Triangle (optional)**\n* Draw a rough sketch of triangle $PQR$.  Label the sides and the median. This can help visualize the problem.\n**5. Consider the Triangle QMR**\n*  Triangle $QMR$ is a right triangle. Why? Because $PQ = QR$ makes $\\triangle PQR$ an isosceles triangle, and the median from the vertex angle of an isosceles triangle is also an altitude.\n**6. Use the Pythagorean Theorem**\n*  We know $QM$ is the hypotenuse of right triangle $QMR$. We also know $QR = 34$ and $MR = 16$. \n*  Apply the Pythagorean Theorem:  $QM^2 = QR^2 - MR^2 = 34^2 - 16^2 = 900$\n*  Therefore, $QM = \\sqrt{900} = \\boxed{30}$. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand Medians**\n* A median of a triangle is a line segment drawn from a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. \n* In triangle PQR, median QM goes from vertex Q to the midpoint of side PR.\n**2. Apply the Median Property**\n* **The Median Property:** The median of a triangle divides the triangle into two triangles with equal areas.\n* Since PQ = QR, triangle PQM and triangle RQM have equal bases (PM = MR) and equal heights (the perpendicular distance from Q to line PR).  Therefore, they have equal areas.\n**3. Use the Law of Cosines**\n* Since we know the sides of triangle PQR, we can use the Law of Cosines to find the angle at Q (let's call it angle Q):\n   *  $PR^2 = PQ^2 + QR^2 - 2(PQ)(QR) \\cos Q$\n   *  $32^2 = 34^2 + 34^2 - 2(34)(34) \\cos Q$\n   *  Solve for $\\cos Q$ and then find the measure of angle Q.\n**4. Apply the Law of Cosines Again**\n* Now, consider triangle PQM.  We know PQ = 34, PM = 16 (half of PR), and we found angle Q in the previous step.  We can use the Law of Cosines to find QM:\n   *  $QM^2 = PQ^2 + PM^2 - 2(PQ)(PM) \\cos Q$\n   *  Substitute the values and solve for QM.\n**Calculation**\nLet's do the calculations:\n* **Finding angle Q:**\n   * $32^2 = 34^2 + 34^2 - 2(34)(34) \\cos Q$\n   * $1024 = 2276 - 2312 \\cos Q$\n   * $\\cos Q = \\frac{1252}{2312} = \\frac{313}{578}$\n   * $Q = \\arccos \\left(\\frac{313}{578}\\right) \\approx 57.8^\\circ$\n* **Finding QM:**\n   * $QM^2 = 34^2 + 16^2 - 2(34)(16) \\cos 57.8^\\circ$\n   * $QM^2 \\approx 1040.2$\n   * $QM \\approx \\sqrt{1040.2} \\approx \\boxed{32.25}$\nTherefore, the length of median QM is approximately 32.25. \n",
