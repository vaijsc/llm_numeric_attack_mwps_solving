    "solution": "Let $A, B,$ and $C$ be the points of intersection in quadrants 4, 1, and 2 respectively. To find the coordinates of $A, B,$ and $C$, we take two line equations at a time and solve for $x$ and $y$. Doing so yields points $A=(2,-3)$, $B=(2,3)$, and $C=(-3,2)$ as vertices of the triangle.\n\nThe circle that passes through the three vertices is the circumcircle of the triangle, and by definition, its center is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of the triangle's sides. To find the center, it suffices to find two perpendicular bisectors (since the third must pass through the intersection of the first two). We find that the perpendicular bisector of $AB$ is the line $y=0$ and the perpendicular bisector of $AC$ is the line $y=x$. These two perpendicular bisectors intersect at $(0,0)$, which is the center of our desired circle.\n\nTo find the radius of our circle, we calculate the distance between the origin and any one of the vertices. The radius has length $\\sqrt{13}$. Thus, our circle has formula $(x-0)^2 + (y-0)^2 = (\\sqrt{13})^2$, or $\\boxed{x^2 + y^2 = 13}$.",

So the first vertex is (2, -3).\n* **Intersection of y = -x - 1 and y = (1/5)x + 13/5:**\n   Set the two equations equal to each other:  -x - 1 = (1/5)x + 13/5.  Solving for x, we get x = -3.  Substitute this back into either equation to find y = 2.  The second vertex is (-3, 2).\n* **Intersection of x = 2 and y = (1/5)x + 13/5:** \n   Substitute x = 2 into the equation y = (1/5)x + 13/5 to get y = 3. The third vertex is (2, 3).\n**2.  Understanding the Circle Equation**\nThe general equation of a circle with center (h, k) and radius r is:\n  (x - h)\u00b2 + (y - k)\u00b2 = r\u00b2\n**3.  Using the Vertices to Find the Center**\n* **The center of the circle lies on the perpendicular bisector of any two chords of the circle.** \n* **The segment connecting (2, -3) and (2, 3) is a vertical chord. Its perpendicular bisector is the horizontal line y = 0.**\n* **The segment connecting (-3, 2) and (2, 3) is a chord. Let's find its midpoint:**\n   Midpoint = ((-3 + 2)/2, (2 + 3)/2) = (-1/2, 5/2)\n* **The perpendicular bisector of the chord passes through (-1/2, 5/2) and is perpendicular to the line connecting (-3, 2) and (2, 3).** \n   The slope of this chord is (3 - 2)/(2 - (-3)) = 1/5.  The perpendicular bisector has a slope of -5.  Using the point-slope form, the equation of the perpendicular bisector is:\n   y - 5/2 = -5(x + 1/2) \n   Simplifying, we get: y = -5x \n* **The intersection of the perpendicular bisectors (y = 0 and y = -5x) gives us the center of the circle.** This intersection point is (0, 0).\n**4.

So, one vertex is (2, -3).\n* **Intersection of y = -x - 1 and y = (1/5)x + 13/5:**  Set the two equations equal to each other: \n   -x - 1 = (1/5)x + 13/5\n   Solve for x:  x = -2\n   Substitute x = -2 into either equation to find y = 1.

Solving the System of Equations**\nNotice that the first and third equations have the same term (2 - h)^2.  This is helpful for eliminating variables:\n* **Subtract the first equation from the third equation:** [(2 - h)^2 + (3 - k)^2] - [(2 - h)^2 + (-3 - k)^2] = r^2 - r^2\n   This simplifies to: 6k = 0, so k = 0.\n* **Substitute k = 0 into the first and second equations:**\n   * (2 - h)^2 + (-3)^2 = r^2\n   * (-2 - h)^2 + 1 = r^2\n* **Subtract the second equation from the first:** [(2 - h)^2 + 9] - [(-2 - h)^2 + 1] = r^2 - r^2\n   This simplifies to: 8h = 8, so h = 1.\n* **Substitute h = 1 and k = 0 into any of the original circle equations to find r:**\n   (2 - 1)^2 + (-3 - 0)^2 = r^2\n   r^2 = 10\n   r = sqrt(10) \n**5. The Equation of the Circle**\nNow that we have the center (h, k) = (1, 0) and radius r = sqrt(10), we can write the equation of the circle:\n(x - 1)^2 + (y - 0)^2 = (sqrt(10))^2\n**Therefore, the equation of the circle passing through the three vertices is (x - 1)^2 + y^2 = 10.** \n",
