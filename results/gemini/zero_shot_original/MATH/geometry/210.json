        "Here's a step-by-step solution to find the length of QA:\n**1. Understand the Properties of Parallelograms and Midpoints**\n* **Parallelograms:** Opposite sides are parallel and congruent. Diagonals bisect each other.\n* **Midpoints:** A midpoint divides a segment into two equal parts.\n**2.  Apply the Properties to the Diagram**\n* Since $M$ is the midpoint of $AB$, we have $AM = MB$.\n* Since $N$ is the midpoint of $BC$, we have $BN = NC$.\n*  Diagonals $AC$ and $BD$ bisect each other at point $O$. \n**3.  Use Similar Triangles**\n* **Triangles DMP and DQA are similar:**  Angle D is common to both triangles, and since $DM$ and $DN$ are parallel, we have  \u2220DMP = \u2220DQA.  Therefore,  \u0394DMP ~ \u0394DQA.\n* **Triangles DNQ and DPB are similar:**  Angle D is common to both triangles, and since $DM$ and $DN$ are parallel, we have \u2220DNQ = \u2220DPB.  Therefore,  \u0394DNQ ~ \u0394DPB.\n**4.  Set up Proportions**\nSince we have similar triangles, we can set up proportions based on corresponding sides:\n* From \u0394DMP ~ \u0394DQA:  $\\frac{DP}{DA} = \\frac{DM}{DQ}$ \n* From \u0394DNQ ~ \u0394DPB:  $\\frac{DQ}{DB} = \\frac{DN}{DP}$\n**5.  Simplify and Solve for QA**\n* Notice that $DA = DB$ (since $ABCD$ is a parallelogram), so we can cancel them in the proportions: \n   * $\\frac{DP}{DA} = \\frac{DM}{DQ}$  becomes  $DP = \\frac{DM}{DQ} \\cdot DA$\n   * $\\frac{DQ}{DB} = \\frac{DN}{DP}$ becomes $DQ = \\frac{DN}{DP} \\cdot DB$\n* Since $DM = DN$ (diagonals bisect each other), we can substitute $DN$ for $DM$ in the first equation: \n   * $DP = \\frac{DN}{DQ} \\cdot DA$\n* Now, let's add the two equations: \n   * $DP + DQ = \\frac{DN}{DQ} \\cdot DA + \\frac{DN}{DP} \\cdot DB$\n   * Since $DA = DB$, we can factor out $DA$: \n   * $DP + DQ = DA \\left( \\frac{DN}{DQ} + \\frac{DN}{DP} \\right)$\n* The term in parentheses can be simplified:\n   *  $\\frac{DN}{DQ} + \\frac{DN}{DP} = \\frac{DN(DP + DQ)}{DQ \\cdot DP}$\n* Substituting back into our equation:\n   * $DP + DQ = DA \\cdot \\frac{DN(DP + DQ)}{DQ \\cdot DP}$\n* Simplifying further, we get:\n    * $DQ \\cdot DP = DA \\cdot DN$\n* We know that $AC = 15$, and since $O$ is the midpoint of $AC$, we have $AO = OC = 7.5$. Therefore:\n   * $QA = QC - AQ = OC - AO = 7.5 - 7.5 = \\boxed{0}$. \n**Conclusion**\nThe point $Q$ coincides with the midpoint of $AC$, so $QA = 0$. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Understanding the Geometry**\n* **Parallelogram Properties:** Opposite sides are parallel and equal in length.  Diagonals bisect each other.\n* **Midpoint Properties:**  A line segment connecting the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and half its length. \n**2.  Key Observations**\n* **Triangle AMN:**  Since M and N are midpoints, MN is parallel to AC and MN = AC/2 = 7.5. \n* **Triangles DPM and DQN:** These triangles share a common base (DM and DN) and have parallel heights (MN and AC).  Therefore, the ratio of their areas is equal to the ratio of their bases: \n   [Area(DPM)]/[Area(DQN)] = [DM]/[DN] \n* **Similar Triangles:** Triangles DPM and DQN are similar because they share three congruent angles (angle D is common, and angles DPM and DQN are corresponding angles of parallel lines). Since they are similar, the ratio of their sides is equal.\n**3.  Applying the Ratios**\n* **[DM]/[DN] = [MP]/[NQ]:**  This ratio represents the sides of the similar triangles DPM and DQN.\n* **[MP]/[NQ] = [AM]/[AN]:**  Since AM = BM and AN = CN (M and N are midpoints), this ratio is equal to 1.\n**4.  Solving for QA**\n* **[DM]/[DN] = 1:**  This means DM = DN.\n* **[Area(DPM)]/[Area(DQN)] = 1:** The areas of triangles DPM and DQN are equal.\n* **[AP]/[CQ] = 1:**  Since the areas of DPM and DQN are equal, their bases must be equal as well.\n* **[AQ]/[QA] = 2:**  Since AC = 15, AP + PQ + QC = 15.  As AP = QC, we have 2AP + PQ = 15.  Since AP = PQ, we have 3AP = 15, and therefore AP = 5.  Thus, AQ = 2AP = 10.\n**Answer:**  QA = **10**. \n",
        "**1. Use the Midpoint Theorem**\n* Since $M$ is the midpoint of $AB$, we know that $AM = MB$.\n* Since $N$ is the midpoint of $BC$, we know that $BN = NC$.\n**2.

This is because:\n    *  $\\angle AMP = \\angle CQP$ (vertical angles)\n    * $\\angle PAM = \\angle PCQ$ (alternate interior angles since $AB \\parallel DC$)\n* Similarly, triangles $BNQ$ and $DQP$ are similar.\n**3. Set up Proportions**\n* From the similarity of $\\triangle AMP$ and $\\triangle CQP$, we have the proportion:  \n   $$\\frac{AP}{CP} = \\frac{AM}{CQ}$$\n* From the similarity of $\\triangle BNQ$ and $\\triangle DQP$, we have the proportion:\n   $$\\frac{BQ}{DQ} = \\frac{BN}{DP}$$\n**4. Use the fact that $AC = 15$**\n* Let $AP = x$ and $CP = 15 - x$.  \n* Since $AM = MB$, we have $AM = \\frac{1}{2} AB$.\n* Since $BN = NC$, we have $BN = \\frac{1}{2} BC$.\n**5.  Solve for $QA$**\n* Substitute the values into the proportions from step 3:\n    * $\\frac{x}{15-x} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} AB}{CQ}$\n    * $\\frac{QA}{DQ} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} BC}{DP}$\n* Since $AB = CD$ and $BC = AD$ (opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal), we can rewrite the proportions as:\n    * $\\frac{x}{15-x} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} CD}{CQ}$\n    * $\\frac{QA}{DQ} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} AD}{DP}$\n* Notice that $CD = CP + PD$ and $AD = AP + PD$.  Substituting these into the proportions:\n    * $\\frac{x}{15-x} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} (15-x + PD)}{CQ}$\n    * $\\frac{QA}{DQ} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} (x + PD)}{DP}$\n* Now, multiply both sides of the first proportion by $CQ$ and both sides of the second proportion by $DP$ to get:\n    * $xCQ = \\frac{1}{2} (15 - x + PD)CQ$\n    * $QA DP = \\frac{1}{2} (x + PD) DP$\n* Simplify and solve for $QA$:\n    * $2xCQ = (15 - x + PD)CQ$\n    * $2QA DP = (x + PD) DP$\n    * $2xCQ = 15CQ - xCQ + PDCQ$\n    * $2QA DP = xDP + PD^2$\n    * $3xCQ = 15CQ + PDCQ$\n    * $2QA DP = xDP + PD^2$\n    * $3x = 15 + PD$\n    * $2QA DP = xDP + PD^2$\n    * $PD = 3x - 15$\n* Substitute $PD$ into the second equation and solve for $QA$:\n    * $2QA (3x - 15) = x(3x - 15) + (3x - 15)^2$\n    * $6QA x - 30QA = 3x^2 - 15x + 9x^2 - 90x + 225$\n    * $6QA x - 30QA = 12x^2 - 105x + 225$\n    * $2QA x - 10QA = 4x^2 - 35x + 75$\n    * $2QA (x - 5) = (4x - 15)(x - 5)$\n    * $2QA = 4x - 15$\n    * $QA = 2x - \\frac{15}{2}$\n* Since $AP = x$ and $CP = 15 - x$, we know that $AC = AP + CP = 15$.

        "Here's a step-by-step solution to find the length of $QA$:\n**1. Key Properties**\n* **Midpoint Theorem:**  In a triangle, the segment connecting the midpoints of two sides is parallel to and half the length of the third side.\n* **Similar Triangles:**  Triangles with corresponding angles equal are similar. Similar triangles have proportional sides.\n**2. Applying the Midpoint Theorem**\n* Since $M$ is the midpoint of $AB$ and $N$ is the midpoint of $BC$, we know that  $MN$ is parallel to $AC$ and $MN = \\frac{1}{2} AC = \\frac{15}{2}$.\n**3.  Identifying Similar Triangles**\n* Triangle $DMN$ is similar to triangle $DQP$.  This is because:\n    * $\\angle DMN = \\angle DQP$ (corresponding angles of parallel lines $MN$ and $AC$)\n    * $\\angle MDN = \\angle QDP$ (common angle)\n    * Therefore, $\\angle DNM = \\angle DPQ$  (by angle sum property of triangles)\n**4. Using Similar Triangles to Find Proportions**\n* Since triangles $DMN$ and $DQP$ are similar, their corresponding sides are proportional:\n    * $\\frac{DQ}{DM} = \\frac{QP}{MN}$\n**5.  Expressing Lengths in Terms of  $QA$**\n* Let's break down the lengths in terms of $QA$:\n    * $DQ = AC - QA = 15 - QA$\n    * $DM = AM + MD = \\frac{1}{2} AB + MD$\n    * $QP = AQ - AP = QA - (AC - AP) = QA - (15 - AP)$\n**6.  Substituting and Solving**\n* Substitute the expressions from step 5 into the proportion from step 4:\n    * $\\frac{15 - QA}{\\frac{1}{2} AB + MD} = \\frac{QA - (15 - AP)}{ \\frac{15}{2}}$\n* Since $AB$ and $MD$ are not given, we can simplify the equation by noting that $AB = CD$ and $MD = ND$. This means that the denominator on the left side is equal to the denominator on the right side. We can cancel them out:\n    * $15 - QA = QA - (15 - AP)$\n* Rearranging the equation:\n    * $30 - QA = QA - AP$\n    * $30 + AP = 2QA$\n* Since $AP$ is a segment within $AC$, it must be smaller than $AC = 15$. This means that  $30 + AP$ is greater than 15. \n* Since $2QA$ is equal to a value greater than 15,  $QA$ must be greater than $\\frac{15}{2}$.\n**7.  Final Answer**\nSince $QA$ must be greater than $\\frac{15}{2}$, we cannot determine an exact numerical value for $QA$. However, we know that $QA > \\frac{15}{2}$. \n",
