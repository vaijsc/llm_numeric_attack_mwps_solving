        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understanding the Midpoint Theorem:**\n* The Midpoint Theorem states that the line segment connecting the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and half its length. \n**2. Applying the Midpoint Theorem:**\n* Since $N$ and $P$ are midpoints, line segment $NP$ is parallel to $AB$ and half its length. This makes $\\triangle APN$ similar to $\\triangle ABC$.\n**3.  Area Relationship in Similar Triangles:**\n* The ratio of the areas of similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Since $NP$ is half the length of $AB$, the area of $\\triangle APN$ is $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4}$ the area of $\\triangle ABC$.\n**4. Finding the Area of Triangle ABC:**\n* We know the area of $\\triangle APN$ is 2 square centimeters.  Since this is 1/4 the area of $\\triangle ABC$, the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is $4 \\cdot 2 = \\boxed{8}$ square centimeters. \n",
        "Since $N$ is the midpoint of $AC$, we have $AN = NC$. Similarly, $AP = PB$. This means that $\\triangle APN$ is half the size of $\\triangle ABC$.  Therefore, the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is twice the area of $\\triangle APN$, or $2 \\cdot 2\\mbox{ cm}^2 = \\boxed{4\\mbox{ cm}^2}$. \n",
        "**1. Understanding the Properties**\n* **Midpoint Theorem:** The line segment joining the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and half its length.  This means that  $PN \\parallel BC$ and $PN = \\frac{1}{2}BC$.\n* **Similar Triangles:** Since $PN \\parallel BC$, triangles $APN$ and $ABC$ are similar.  This means their corresponding sides are proportional.\n**2. Finding the Area Relationship**\nThe ratio of the areas of two similar triangles is equal to the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides.  Since $PN = \\frac{1}{2}BC$, the ratio of corresponding sides of triangles $APN$ and $ABC$ is 1:2.\nTherefore, the ratio of their areas is $(1/2)^2 = 1/4$.  This means that the area of triangle $ABC$ is 4 times the area of triangle $APN$.\n**3. Calculating the Area of Triangle ABC**\nWe are given that the area of triangle $APN$ is 2 cm\u00b2. Since the area of triangle $ABC$ is 4 times the area of triangle $APN$, the area of triangle $ABC$ is $4 \\times 2 = \\boxed{8}$ square centimeters. \n",
        "Here's a step-by-step solution:\n**1. Understanding the Diagram:**\n*  We have a right triangle ABC, with right angle at C.\n*  M, N, and P are midpoints of the sides, which means they divide the sides in half.\n*  Triangle APN is a smaller triangle within triangle ABC.\n**2. Key Properties:**\n* **Midpoint Theorem:**  The line segment joining the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and half its length. \n* **Similar Triangles:** Triangle APN is similar to triangle ABC (because of parallel lines). \n**3. Ratios and Area:**\n* **Side Ratio:** Since NP is half the length of AB, the ratio of corresponding sides of triangles APN and ABC is 1:2. \n* **Area Ratio:** The ratio of the areas of similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Therefore, the area of triangle ABC is  2\u00b2 = 4 times the area of triangle APN.\n**4. Finding the Area of ABC:**\n* We know the area of triangle APN is 2 cm\u00b2. \n* The area of triangle ABC is 4 * 2 cm\u00b2 = 8 cm\u00b2.\n**Therefore, the area of triangle ABC is 8 square centimeters.** \n",
        "### Response:\nSince $N$ and $P$ are midpoints, line segment $NP$ is parallel to line segment $AB$ and half its length. This means $\\triangle APN$ is similar to $\\triangle ABC$ with a scale factor of $\\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe ratio of the areas of similar figures is the square of the scale factor.  Since the area of $\\triangle APN$ is $2 \\mbox{ cm}^2$, the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is $(2)^2 \\cdot 2 = \\boxed{8} \\mbox{ cm}^2$. \n"
