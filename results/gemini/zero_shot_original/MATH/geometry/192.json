    "problem": "Theo has one sphere with radius 5; Akshaj has two spheres with radius 2.  What is the ratio of the surface area of Theo's sphere to the total surface area of Akshaj's spheres?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The surface area of a sphere with radius $r$ is $4\\pi r^2$.  Thus, Theo's sphere has surface area $4\\pi(5^2)=100\\pi$ and each of Akshaj's spheres have surface area $4\\pi(2^2)=16\\pi$, so Akshaj's spheres together have surface area $16\\pi\\cdot 2 = 32\\pi$.  The desired ratio is hence $\\frac{100\\pi}{32\\pi} = \\boxed{\\frac{25}{8}}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Formulas:**\n* **Surface Area of a Sphere:** 4\u03c0r\u00b2 \n**2. Theo's Sphere:**\n* Radius (r) = 5\n* Surface Area = 4\u03c0(5)\u00b2 = 100\u03c0\n**3. Akshaj's Spheres:**\n* Radius (r) = 2\n* Surface Area of one sphere = 4\u03c0(2)\u00b2 = 16\u03c0\n* Total Surface Area of both spheres = 16\u03c0 + 16\u03c0 = 32\u03c0\n**4. Ratio:**\n* Ratio of Theo's sphere surface area to Akshaj's sphere surface area: 100\u03c0 / 32\u03c0 = 25/8\n**Answer:** The ratio of the surface area of Theo's sphere to the total surface area of Akshaj's spheres is **25:8**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the surface area of Theo's sphere:**\n* The formula for the surface area of a sphere is 4\u03c0r\u00b2, where r is the radius.\n* Theo's sphere has a radius of 5, so its surface area is 4\u03c0(5\u00b2) = 100\u03c0.\n**2. Find the surface area of one of Akshaj's spheres:**\n* Akshaj's spheres have a radius of 2, so the surface area of one sphere is 4\u03c0(2\u00b2) = 16\u03c0.\n**3. Find the total surface area of Akshaj's spheres:**\n* Since Akshaj has two spheres, the total surface area is 2 * 16\u03c0 = 32\u03c0.\n**4. Find the ratio of Theo's sphere's surface area to Akshaj's spheres' total surface area:**\n* The ratio is (100\u03c0) / (32\u03c0) = 25/8.\n**Therefore, the ratio of the surface area of Theo's sphere to the total surface area of Akshaj's spheres is 25:8.** \n",
