        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Find the side length of the equilateral triangles:**\n* Since AC is 3 units long, and triangle ABC is equilateral, each side of the smaller triangles is 3 units.\n**2. Find the area of one of the smaller equilateral triangles:**\n* The area of an equilateral triangle with side length *s* is given by  (\u221a3 / 4) * s\u00b2\n* In this case, the area of one small triangle is (\u221a3 / 4) * 3\u00b2 = (9\u221a3) / 4 square units.\n**3. Find the area of the central hexagon:**\n* The hexagon is made up of 6 equilateral triangles.\n* The area of the hexagon is 6 times the area of one small triangle: 6 * (9\u221a3) / 4 = (27\u221a3) / 2 square units.\n**4. Find the area of one of the larger equilateral triangles:**\n*  Notice that each larger equilateral triangle is formed by two small equilateral triangles and a portion of the hexagon.\n* The area of one larger triangle is the area of two small triangles plus the area of one-sixth of the hexagon: 2 * (9\u221a3 / 4) + (1/6) * (27\u221a3 / 2) = (27\u221a3) / 4 square units.\n**5. Find the total area of the star:**\n* The star is made up of 6 larger equilateral triangles.\n* The total area of the star is 6 times the area of one larger triangle: 6 * (27\u221a3) / 4 = **(81\u221a3) / 2 square units**. \n",
