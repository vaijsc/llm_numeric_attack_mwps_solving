        "Here's how to find the area of the quadrilateral step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Quadrilateral**\nPlot the points on a coordinate plane. You'll see that the quadrilateral is a kite.  \n**2. Divide into Triangles**\nDraw a diagonal connecting the points (0,1) and (2,0). This divides the kite into two congruent triangles.\n**3. Calculate the Area of One Triangle**\n* **Base:**  The base of each triangle is the distance between (0,1) and (2,0), which is 2 units.\n* **Height:** The height of each triangle is the perpendicular distance from the point (0,1) to the line segment connecting (2,0) and (0,-3). This distance is 4 units (the difference between the y-coordinates of (0,1) and (0,-3)).\n* **Area of one triangle:** (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 2 * 4 = 4 square units\n**4. Calculate the Total Area**\nSince the kite has two congruent triangles, the total area is:\n2 * (Area of one triangle) = 2 * 4 = **8 square units** \n",
