    "solution": "The base has area $B=4\\cdot 4=16.$  The length of the segment connecting a vertex of the base to the center of the base equals $\\sqrt{2^2+2^2}=2\\sqrt{2}.$   This segment and the altitude of the pyramid form a right triangle with hypotenuse of length $4$.  Thus we have $h=\\sqrt{4^2-(2\\sqrt{2})^2}=\\sqrt{8}$.  By the volume formula for a pyramid, we have $V=Bh/3=16\\sqrt{8}/3\\approx \\boxed{15.08}$ cubic inches.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Pyramid**\nImagine a pyramid with a square base and four triangular faces.  Each edge (including the base edges) is 4 inches long.\n**2. Find the Height of the Pyramid**\n* **Draw a Diagram:**  Draw a cross-section of the pyramid, cutting through the apex (top point) and two opposite corners of the base. This creates a right triangle.\n* **Identify the Sides:** The hypotenuse of this triangle is one of the slant edges of the pyramid (4 inches).  Half of the base diagonal forms one leg of the triangle (2 inches, since the base is a square).  The height of the pyramid is the other leg.\n* **Use the Pythagorean Theorem:**  a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n     *  a = height of the pyramid\n     *  b = 2 inches\n     *  c = 4 inches \n     *  a\u00b2 + 2\u00b2 = 4\u00b2\n     *  a\u00b2 + 4 = 16\n     *  a\u00b2 = 12\n     *  a = \u221a12 \u2248 3.46 inches\n**3.

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Pyramid**\nImagine a square pyramid.  The base is a square, and all four edges (from the base corners to the apex) are equal in length.\n**2. Find the Height**\n* **Slant Height:**  Since each edge is 4 inches, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the slant height (the height of a triangular face).  Consider half of the square base and a triangular face. This forms a right triangle where:\n   * Hypotenuse = 4 inches (edge of the pyramid)\n   * Base = 2 inches (half of the square base side)\n   * Height = slant height (what we need to find)\n* **Pythagorean Theorem:**  a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n   * 2\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 4\u00b2\n   * 4 + b\u00b2 = 16\n   * b\u00b2 = 12\n   * b = \u221a12 = 2\u221a3 inches (slant height)\n* **Real Height:** Now, consider the right triangle formed by the apex of the pyramid, the center of the square base, and a point in the middle of one of the base edges. \n   * Hypotenuse = slant height = 2\u221a3 inches\n   * Base = half the diagonal of the square base = \u221a2 inches (use Pythagorean Theorem on the square base)\n   * Height = the actual height of the pyramid (what we need to find)\n* **Pythagorean Theorem:** \n    * (\u221a2)\u00b2 + h\u00b2 = (2\u221a3)\u00b2\n    * 2 + h\u00b2 = 12\n    * h\u00b2 = 10\n    * h = \u221a10 inches \n**3. Calculate the Volume**\n* **Volume of a Pyramid:**  (1/3) * (area of base) * (height)\n* **Area of Base:**  Side of square = 4 inches, so area = 4\u00b2 = 16 square inches\n* **Volume:** (1/3) * 16 * \u221a10 \u2248 16.97 cubic inches\n**Therefore, the volume of the pyramid is approximately 16.97 cubic inches.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Pyramid**\nImagine a square pyramid with all edges measuring 4 inches.\n**2. Find the Base Area**\n* The base is a square with sides of 4 inches.\n* The area of a square is side * side.\n* Base area = 4 inches * 4 inches = 16 square inches.\n**3. Find the Height**\n* Draw a line from the apex (top point) of the pyramid perpendicular to the center of the base. This is the height.\n* You now have a right triangle where:\n    * The hypotenuse is one of the pyramid's edges (4 inches).\n    * One leg is half the length of the base's diagonal (which is 4\u221a2 inches / 2 = 2\u221a2 inches).\n* Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the height (the other leg):\n    * height\u00b2 + (2\u221a2)\u00b2 = 4\u00b2\n    * height\u00b2 + 8 = 16\n    * height\u00b2 = 8\n    * height = \u221a8 = 2\u221a2 inches\n**4. Calculate the Volume**\n* The volume of a pyramid is (1/3) * base area * height.\n* Volume = (1/3) * 16 square inches * 2\u221a2 inches\n* Volume = (32\u221a2)/3 cubic inches \n**5. Approximate the Decimal**\n* Use a calculator to approximate \u221a2 \u2248 1.414\n* Volume \u2248 (32 * 1.414)/3 \u2248 15.06 cubic inches\n**Answer:** The volume of the pyramid is approximately **15.06** cubic inches. \n"
