        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Parallelogram**\nImagine a parallelogram.  Opposite sides of a parallelogram are parallel and equal in length.\n**2. Identify the Missing Vertex**\n* We know three vertices: (5, 3), (6, 8), and (7, 4). \n* The fourth vertex is (x, y) and we know x > 7. \n**3.  Use Slope to Find the Missing Vertex**\n* **Find the slope of the line segment connecting (5, 3) and (6, 8):** \n   Slope = (8 - 3) / (6 - 5) = 5\n* **The opposite side of the parallelogram must have the same slope.**  This means the line segment connecting (7, 4) and (x, y) must also have a slope of 5.\n* **Set up the slope equation:** (y - 4) / (x - 7) = 5\n**4.  Use Parallelism to Find Another Equation**\n* **Find the slope of the line segment connecting (5, 3) and (7, 4):**\n   Slope = (4 - 3) / (7 - 5) = 1/2\n* **The opposite side of the parallelogram must have the same slope.** This means the line segment connecting (6, 8) and (x, y) must also have a slope of 1/2.\n* **Set up the slope equation:** (y - 8) / (x - 6) = 1/2\n**5. Solve the System of Equations**\nWe now have two equations with two unknowns:\n* (y - 4) / (x - 7) = 5\n* (y - 8) / (x - 6) = 1/2\nSolve this system.  One way is to:\n* **Simplify the equations:**\n   * y - 4 = 5x - 35\n   * 2y - 16 = x - 6\n* **Solve for y in terms of x:**\n   * y = 5x - 31\n   * y = (x + 10) / 2\n* **Set the two expressions for y equal to each other:**\n   * 5x - 31 = (x + 10) / 2\n* **Solve for x:**\n   * 10x - 62 = x + 10\n   * 9x = 72\n   * x = 8\n* **Substitute x = 8 back into either equation to find y:**\n   * y = 5(8) - 31 = 9\n**6. Find x + y**\n* x + y = 8 + 9 = 17\n**Therefore, the value of x + y is 17.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Properties of Parallelograms:**\n* **Opposite sides are parallel and equal in length.**\n* **Opposite angles are equal.**\n**2. Visualize the Problem:**\nImagine the parallelogram with the given points.  Since we know three points, we can start to see the shape forming. \n**3.  Find the Missing Vertex:**\n* **Parallel Lines:**  Notice that the line segment connecting (5, 3) and (6, 8) has a slope of 5 (rise of 5, run of 1).  Since opposite sides of a parallelogram are parallel, the line segment containing the missing vertex will also have a slope of 5.\n* **Equal Lengths:**  The line segment connecting (5, 3) and (6, 8) has a length of \u221a26 (using the distance formula).  The opposite side, containing the missing vertex, must also have a length of \u221a26.\n**4.  Use Slope and Distance to Find the Missing Vertex:**\n* **Slope:** Start at (7, 4) and move 1 unit to the right (since the slope is 5).  This takes us to (8, 4).  Then, move 5 units up (since the slope is 5), which brings us to (8, 9).\n* **Distance:** We need to check if the distance between (7, 4) and (8, 9) is \u221a26.  Using the distance formula, we find it is.\n**5.  Therefore:**\nThe missing vertex is (8, 9).\n**6.  Calculate x + y:**\nx + y = 8 + 9 = **17** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand Parallelograms**\n* **Opposite sides are parallel:**  This means they have the same slope.\n* **Opposite sides are equal in length:** This helps us find the missing coordinate.\n**2. Find the Slope of a Side**\nLet's find the slope of the side connecting (5, 3) and (6, 8):\n* Slope = (change in y) / (change in x) = (8 - 3) / (6 - 5) = 5/1 = 5\n**3. Find the Parallel Side**\nThe side opposite this one will also have a slope of 5.  Since we know (7, 4) is on this side, we can use the slope to find the missing coordinate (x, y). \n* Let's use the slope formula again: 5 = (y - 4) / (x - 7)\n* Cross-multiply: 5(x - 7) = y - 4\n* Expand: 5x - 35 = y - 4\n* Rearrange: y = 5x - 31\n**4. Find the Length of a Side**\nThe distance between (5, 3) and (6, 8) is the length of one side. We can use the distance formula:\n* Distance = \u221a[(6 - 5)\u00b2 + (8 - 3)\u00b2] = \u221a(1\u00b2 + 5\u00b2) = \u221a26\n**5. Find the Missing Coordinate**\nThe side opposite this one will also have a length of \u221a26.  We can use the distance formula again, this time between (7, 4) and (x, y):\n* \u221a26 = \u221a[(x - 7)\u00b2 + (y - 4)\u00b2]\n* Square both sides: 26 = (x - 7)\u00b2 + (y - 4)\u00b2\n**6. Substitute and Solve**\nWe know that y = 5x - 31. Substitute this into the equation above:\n* 26 = (x - 7)\u00b2 + (5x - 31 - 4)\u00b2\n* 26 = (x - 7)\u00b2 + (5x - 35)\u00b2\n* Simplify and solve for x. This will lead to a quadratic equation.  Solve for x (remember, we want x > 7).\n**7. Find y**\nOnce you have the value of x, substitute it back into the equation y = 5x - 31 to find y.\n**8. Calculate x + y**\nFinally, add the values of x and y that you found.\n**Important Note:** The calculations for finding x and y can be quite involved. Make sure to simplify and solve the quadratic equation carefully. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Understand Parallelograms**\n* Opposite sides of a parallelogram are parallel and equal in length.\n**2. Find the Missing Vertex**\n* **Slope:**  The slope of the line connecting (5, 3) and (6, 8) is (8-3)/(6-5) = 5.  Since opposite sides are parallel, the line connecting (7, 4) and (x, y) must also have a slope of 5.\n* **Equation:** Using the point-slope form, the equation of the line passing through (7, 4) with a slope of 5 is: \n   y - 4 = 5(x - 7)\n* **Solve for y:**\n   y - 4 = 5x - 35\n   y = 5x - 31\n**3. Determine the Value of x**\n* The x-coordinate of the missing vertex must be greater than 7.  Since the line has a positive slope, as x increases, y also increases. \n* Since the opposite sides are equal in length, the distance between (5, 3) and (6, 8) must be equal to the distance between (7, 4) and (x, y).\n* **Distance Formula:**  Calculate the distance between (5, 3) and (6, 8) using the distance formula: \u221a((6-5)\u00b2 + (8-3)\u00b2) = \u221a26\n*  **Find x:**  Set the distance between (7, 4) and (x, y) equal to \u221a26 and solve for x:\n   \u221a((x-7)\u00b2 + (y-4)\u00b2) = \u221a26\n   Since we know y = 5x - 31, substitute:\n   \u221a((x-7)\u00b2 + (5x - 31 - 4)\u00b2) = \u221a26\n   Simplify and solve for x.  You'll find x = 12.\n**4. Calculate x + y**\n* Substitute x = 12 into the equation y = 5x - 31 to find y:\n   y = 5(12) - 31 = 29\n* Therefore, x + y = 12 + 29 = **41** \n",

Visualize the Problem**\nImagine plotting the points (5, 3), (6, 8), and (7, 4) on a coordinate plane.  Since we know the fourth point has an x-coordinate greater than 7, it must lie to the right of the other three points.\n**3. Find the Missing Side**\n* **Slope:** The slope of the line connecting (5, 3) and (6, 8) is (8-3)/(6-5) = 5.  \n* **Parallel Lines:**  The opposite side of the parallelogram will also have a slope of 5.  \n* **Finding the Missing Point:** Starting at (7, 4), move 1 unit to the right (because the x-coordinate is greater than 7) and 5 units up (because the slope is 5). This brings you to the point (8, 9).\n**4. Calculate x + y**\n* **x = 8** \n* **y = 9**\nTherefore, x + y = 8 + 9 = **17** \n"
