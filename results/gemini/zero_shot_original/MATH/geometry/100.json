    "solution": "In three hours, the hour hand travels $\\frac{1}{4}$ of a revolution while the minute hand travels 3 revolutions.  So the ratio of the number of revolutions traveled by the hour hand to the number of revolutions traveled by the minute hand is $\\frac{1}{12}$.  However, the ratio of distances traveled is even smaller, because for each revolution the hour hand travels $\\frac{2\\pi(6\\text{ in.})}{2\\pi(8\\text{ in.})}=\\frac{3}{4}$ as far as the minute hand.  Therefore, the ratio of the total distance traveled by the hour hand to the total distance traveled by the minute hand is $\\dfrac{1}{12}\\cdot \\dfrac{3}{4}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{16}}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Circumference of the Circles:**\n* **Hour Hand:** The hour hand travels in a circle with a radius of 6 inches.  Its circumference is  2\u03c0r = 2\u03c0(6) = 12\u03c0 inches.\n* **Minute Hand:** The minute hand travels in a circle with a radius of 8 inches. Its circumference is 2\u03c0r = 2\u03c0(8) = 16\u03c0 inches.\n**2.  Distance Traveled:**\n* **Hour Hand:**  From noon to 3 p.m., the hour hand moves a quarter of the way around its circle.  So, it travels (1/4) * 12\u03c0 = 3\u03c0 inches.\n* **Minute Hand:** From noon to 3 p.m., the minute hand makes three complete revolutions.  So, it travels 3 * 16\u03c0 = 48\u03c0 inches.\n**3.  Ratio:**\nThe ratio of the distance traveled by the hour hand to the distance traveled by the minute hand is:\n(3\u03c0 inches) / (48\u03c0 inches) = **1/16** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1.  Understand the Movement:**\n* **Hour Hand:** The hour hand moves a full circle (360 degrees) in 12 hours.\n* **Minute Hand:** The minute hand moves a full circle (360 degrees) in 60 minutes.\n**2. Calculate the Distance Traveled:**\n* **Hour Hand:** From noon to 3 p.m., the hour hand moves 1/4 of a circle.  The circumference of the circle traced by the hour hand is 2\u03c0 * 6 inches = 12\u03c0 inches. So, the hour hand travels (1/4) * 12\u03c0 inches = 3\u03c0 inches.\n* **Minute Hand:** From noon to 3 p.m. (180 minutes), the minute hand moves three full circles. The circumference of the circle traced by the minute hand is 2\u03c0 * 8 inches = 16\u03c0 inches. So, the minute hand travels 3 * 16\u03c0 inches = 48\u03c0 inches.\n**3. Find the Ratio:**\nThe ratio of the distance traveled by the hour hand to the distance traveled by the minute hand is:\n3\u03c0 inches / 48\u03c0 inches = **1/16** \n",
