        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n* **Visualize:** Imagine a cube. It has 6 square faces.\n* **Find the area of one face:** Each face is a square with side length 3 inches.  The area of a square is side * side, so the area of one face is 3 inches * 3 inches = 9 square inches.\n* **Calculate the total surface area:** Since there are 6 faces, the total surface area is 6 * 9 square inches = 54 square inches.\n**Answer:** The cube's total surface area is 54 square inches. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n* **1. Find the area of one face:** A cube has square faces.  The area of a square is side length squared. So, the area of one face is 3 inches * 3 inches = 9 square inches.\n* **2. Find the total surface area:** A cube has 6 faces.  Therefore, the total surface area is 6 * 9 square inches = 54 square inches.\n**Answer:** The cube's total surface area is **54 square inches**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Understand the Shape:**\n* A cube has 6 square faces.\n**2. Calculate the Area of One Face:**\n* Each face is a square with side length 3 inches.\n* Area of a square = side * side = 3 inches * 3 inches = 9 square inches.\n**3. Calculate the Total Surface Area:**\n* Since there are 6 faces, the total surface area is 6 * 9 square inches = 54 square inches.\n**Answer:** The cube's total surface area is **54 square inches**. \n",
