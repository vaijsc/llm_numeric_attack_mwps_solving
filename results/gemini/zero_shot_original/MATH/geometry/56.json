    "solution": "The solution set of the first inequality is a closed disk whose center is (4,0) and whose radius is 4.  Each of the second two inequalities describes a line ($y=x-4$ and $y=-\\frac{1}{3}x$, respectively), as well as the region above it.  The intersection of these three sets is the shaded region shown.  This region consists of a triangle, marked 1, along with a sector of a circle, marked 2.  The vertices of the triangle are (0,0), (4,0) and the intersection point of $y=x-4$ and $y=-\\frac{1}{3}x$.  Setting the right-hand sides of these two equations equal to each other, we find $x=3$ and $y=-1$.  Therefore, the height of the triangle is 1 unit and the base of the triangle is 4 units, so the area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}(1)(4)=2$ square units.  The central angle of the shaded sector is $180^\\circ-45^\\circ=135^\\circ$, so its area is $\\frac{135}{360}\\pi(4)^2=6\\pi$ square units.

Identify the Enclosed Region**\nThe enclosed region is the area shaded in the graph, a segment of the circle.\n**4. Find the Intersection Points**\n* **Circle and y = x - 4:** Substitute y = x - 4 into the circle equation:\n   (x - 4)\u00b2 + (x - 4)\u00b2 \u2264 16\n   2(x - 4)\u00b2 \u2264 16\n   (x - 4)\u00b2 \u2264 8\n   x - 4 \u2264 2\u221a2  or  x - 4 \u2265 -2\u221a2\n   x \u2264 4 + 2\u221a2  or  x \u2265 4 - 2\u221a2\n   Since y = x - 4, the intersection points are (4 + 2\u221a2, 2\u221a2) and (4 - 2\u221a2, -2\u221a2).\n* **Circle and y = -1/3 x:** Substitute y = -1/3 x into the circle equation:\n   (x - 4)\u00b2 + (-1/3 x)\u00b2 \u2264 16\n   10/9 x\u00b2 - 8x + 16 \u2264 16\n   10/9 x\u00b2 - 8x \u2264 0\n   x(10/9 x - 8) \u2264 0\n   This gives us x = 0 and x = 7.2.  Since y = -1/3 x, the intersection points are (0, 0) and (7.2, -2.4).\n**5. Calculate the Area**\nThe enclosed region is a sector of the circle minus a triangle:\n* **Sector Area:** The angle of the sector is the angle between the lines y = x - 4 and y = -1/3 x.  The slopes of the lines are 1 and -1/3, so the tangent of the angle is (1 - (-1/3)) / (1 * (-1/3) + 1) = 4/2 = 2.  The angle is arctan(2), and the sector area is (1/2) * (arctan(2)) * 4\u00b2 = 8 * arctan(2).\n* **Triangle Area:** The triangle has vertices at (0, 0), (4 - 2\u221a2, -2\u221a2), and (4 + 2\u221a2, 2\u221a2). Its base is 4\u221a2 and its height is 4\u221a2, so its area is (1/2) * 4\u221a2 * 4\u221a2 = 16.\n**6. Final Answer**\nThe area of the enclosed region is 8 * arctan(2) - 16.

Calculate the Area**\nThe enclosed region can be divided into two parts: a triangle and a sector of the circle.\n* **Triangle:** The base of the triangle is the distance between (4 + 2\u221a2, 2\u221a2) and (4 - 2\u221a2, -2\u221a2), which is 4\u221a2. The height is 2\u221a2.\n  Area of triangle = (1/2)(4\u221a2)(2\u221a2) = 8\n* **Sector:** The sector is a portion of the circle with a central angle determined by the points (0, 0), (4 + 2\u221a2, 2\u221a2), and (4 - 2\u221a2, -2\u221a2).  To find the angle, we can use the dot product.  Let  $\\mathbf{u}$ be the vector from (0,0) to (4 + 2\u221a2, 2\u221a2), and let $\\mathbf{v}$ be the vector from (0,0) to (4 - 2\u221a2, -2\u221a2).  Then\n\\[\\cos \\theta = \\frac{\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}}{||\\mathbf{u}|| ||\\mathbf{v}||} = \\frac{(4 + 2 \\sqrt{2})(4 - 2 \\sqrt{2}) + (2 \\sqrt{2})(-2 \\sqrt{2})}{\\sqrt{(4 + 2 \\sqrt{2})^2 + (2 \\sqrt{2})^2} \\sqrt{(4 - 2 \\sqrt{2})^2 + (-2 \\sqrt{2})^2}} = 0.\\]Thus, the central angle is $90^\\circ$, and the sector is one-quarter of the circle.  \nArea of sector = (1/4)(\u03c0)(4)\u00b2 = 4\u03c0\n**6.

Identify the Relevant Geometric Shapes**\nThe solution region is a sector of a circle.  To find its area, we need:\n* **The central angle:**  Notice that the lines intersect at the origin (0,0).  The angle between the lines is the central angle of the sector.  We can use the tangent function to find this angle:\n   * The slope of the blue line is -1/3, so its angle with the x-axis is arctan(-1/3).\n   * The slope of the green line is 1, so its angle with the x-axis is arctan(1) = \u03c0/4.\n   * The central angle of the sector is the difference: (\u03c0/4) - arctan(-1/3)\n* **The radius of the circle:** The circle has a radius of 4.\n**4.
