    "solution": "We must find the radius of the circle in order to find the area. We are told that points $A$ and $B$ are the endpoints of a diameter, so we can find the distance between these two points. We could use the distance formula, but since $A$ and $B$ have the same $y$-coordinate, we can see that the distance between them is $10 - 2 = 8$.\n\nSince the diameter has a length of 8, the radius must have length 4. Therefore, the answer is $4^2\\pi = \\boxed{16\\pi}$.",

        "1. **Find the diameter:** The diameter of the circle is the distance between points A and B. Since they have the same y-coordinate, the diameter is simply the difference in their x-coordinates: 10 - 2 = 8 units.\n2. **Find the radius:** The radius of the circle is half the diameter, so the radius is 8 / 2 = 4 units.\n3. **Calculate the area:** The area of a circle is given by the formula  \u03c0 * r\u00b2, where r is the radius.  Therefore, the area of this circle is \u03c0 * (4)\u00b2 = **16\u03c0 square units**. \n",
