    "solution": "We start by finding the radius of the inscribed sphere. If we slice the diagram by a plane that contains the central axis of the cone, we get a circle inscribed in an isosceles triangle with base 6 and height 4, and the radius of the inscribed circle is the same as the radius of the sphere (since any plane that contains the central axis of the cone contains a diameter of the inscribed sphere). We label the points as shown in the diagram below.\n\n[asy]\ndraw((0,3)--(4,0)--(0,-3)--cycle);\ndraw(circle((1.5,0),1.5));\ndraw((0,0)--(4,0),dashed);\nlabel(\"$A$\",(0,3),NW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",(4,0),E);\nlabel(\"$C$\",(0,-3),SW);\nlabel(\"$D$\",(0,0),W);\ndraw((0,.5)--(.5,.5)--(.5,0));\n[/asy]\n\nSince $AD$ has length 3 and $DB$ has length 4, segment $AB$ has length 5, from the Pythagorean theorem. Similarly, segment $CB$ has length 5.  Now, the area of triangle $ABC$ is equal to the semiperimeter times the radius of the inscribed circle. On the other hand, we know that the area of $ABC$ is also  \\[\\frac{1}{2} AC \\cdot DB = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 6 \\cdot 4 = 24/2. \\]Let $\\rho$ be the radius of the inscribed circle, and let $s$ be the semiperimeter of $ABC$.  We then have \\[ \\frac{24}{2} = \\rho s = \\rho \\cdot \\frac{AB + BC+ AC}{2}\n=\\rho \\cdot \\frac{16}{2} . \\]Therefore \\[ \\rho = \\frac{24}{16} = 3/2. \\]Thus the volume of the inscribed sphere is $\\frac{4}{3} \\pi \\rho^3\n= \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (3/2)^3$.\n\nOn the other hand, the volume of a cone with radius $r$ and height $h$ is $\\frac{\\pi}{3} r^2 h$, so the volume of our cone is \\[ \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 4 .\\]Therefore the ratio of the volume of the sphere to the volume of the cone is \\[ \\frac{(4\\pi /3) (3/2)^3}{(\\pi/3) \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 4}\n= \\frac{4 \\cdot 27/8}{9 \\cdot 4}\n= \\boxed{\\frac{3}{8}} . \\]",

        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Find the radius of the sphere:**\n* Draw a line segment from the apex of the cone to the center of the sphere.  This line segment is also a radius of the sphere.\n* Draw a line segment from the center of the sphere to a point where the sphere touches the base of the cone. This line segment is also a radius of the sphere.\n* These two line segments, along with the radius of the cone's base, form a right triangle.\n* The hypotenuse of this triangle is the height of the cone (4), and one leg is the radius of the cone's base (3).  Let the other leg be the radius of the sphere, *r*.\n* Using the Pythagorean Theorem:  3\u00b2 + *r*\u00b2 = 4\u00b2 \n* Solving for *r*, we get *r* = \u221a7.\n**2. Find the volumes:**\n* Volume of the sphere: (4/3)\u03c0(*r*)\u00b3 = (4/3)\u03c0(\u221a7)\u00b3\n* Volume of the cone: (1/3)\u03c0(3)\u00b2(4) = 12\u03c0\n**3. Calculate the ratio:**\n* Ratio of sphere volume to cone volume: [(4/3)\u03c0(\u221a7)\u00b3] / (12\u03c0) = (\u221a7)\u00b3/9\n**Therefore, the ratio of the volume of the sphere to the volume of the cone is (\u221a7)\u00b3/9.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the radius of the sphere:**\n* **Similar triangles:** The sphere's diameter is equal to the height of the cone minus the slant height of the cone.  \n* **Pythagorean Theorem:** The slant height of the cone is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs 3 and 4.  Therefore, the slant height is 5.\n* **Sphere radius:** The sphere's diameter is 4 - 5 = -1. This doesn't make sense! This means the sphere cannot be inscribed within the cone.  \n**Conclusion:** There's an error in the problem statement. It's impossible to inscribe a sphere within a cone with these dimensions.  A sphere inscribed within a cone will always have a diameter less than the height of the cone. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step by step:\n**1. Understand the Geometry**\n* **Inscribed Sphere:** The sphere fits perfectly inside the cone, touching the cone's base and its side.\n* **Similar Triangles:**  Draw a vertical line from the apex of the cone to the center of the sphere's base. This creates two similar right triangles: one formed by the cone's height, radius, and slant height, and the other formed by the sphere's radius, the distance from the cone's apex to the sphere's center, and the cone's slant height.\n**2. Set up Ratios**\n* **Radius Ratio:** The ratio of the sphere's radius (r) to the cone's radius (3) is the same as the ratio of the distance from the cone's apex to the sphere's center (4 - r) to the cone's height (4):  \n   (r/3) = (4 - r)/4\n**3. Solve for the Sphere's Radius**\n* Cross-multiply: 4r = 12 - 3r\n* Combine like terms: 7r = 12\n* Solve for r: r = 12/7\n**4. Calculate Volumes**\n* **Sphere Volume:**  V_sphere = (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3 = (4/3)\u03c0(12/7)\u00b3\n* **Cone Volume:** V_cone = (1/3)\u03c0r\u00b2h = (1/3)\u03c0(3\u00b2)(4)\n**5. Find the Ratio**\n(V_sphere / V_cone) = [(4/3)\u03c0(12/7)\u00b3] / [(1/3)\u03c0(3\u00b2)(4)] \n* Simplify: (4/3)\u03c0(12/7)\u00b3 / (1/3)\u03c0(3\u00b2)(4) = (12/7)\u00b3 / (3\u00b2)(4) \n* Calculate: (12/7)\u00b3 / (3\u00b2)(4) = 64/49\n**Answer:** The ratio of the volume of the sphere to the volume of the cone is **64/49**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Visualize the Setup**\nImagine a cone with its vertex pointing upwards. The sphere is nestled inside the cone, touching the cone's base and its sides.\n**2. Key Relationships**\n* **Similar Triangles:**  Draw a line from the cone's vertex to the center of the sphere. This line, along with a radius of the sphere and a line from the center of the sphere to a point on the cone's base, form a right triangle. This triangle is similar to the larger triangle formed by the cone's height, radius, and slant height.\n* **Finding the Sphere's Radius:** Let the radius of the sphere be *r*. The smaller right triangle has legs of length *r* and 3 - *r* (since the sphere's radius takes away from the cone's radius). The larger right triangle has legs of length 4 and 3.  Using the similarity of triangles, we have the proportion:  *r* / (3 - *r*) = 4 / 3. Solving for *r*, we get *r* = 12/7.\n**3. Calculate Volumes**\n* **Sphere Volume:**  V<sub>sphere</sub> = (4/3)\u03c0r<sup>3</sup> = (4/3)\u03c0(12/7)<sup>3</sup>\n* **Cone Volume:** V<sub>cone</sub> = (1/3)\u03c0r<sup>2</sup>h = (1/3)\u03c0(3<sup>2</sup>)(4)\n**4. Find the Ratio**\nThe ratio of the sphere's volume to the cone's volume is:\n(V<sub>sphere</sub> / V<sub>cone</sub>) = [(4/3)\u03c0(12/7)<sup>3</sup>] / [(1/3)\u03c0(3<sup>2</sup>)(4)]\nSimplifying, we get:  **(12/7)<sup>3</sup> / (3<sup>2</sup>)(4) = ** **64/343** \n**Therefore, the ratio of the volume of the sphere to the volume of the cone is 64/343.** \n",

The sphere's diameter is equal to the cone's base diameter.\n**2. Find the Sphere's Radius**\n* Since the sphere's diameter equals the cone's base diameter, the sphere's radius is half the cone's base radius:  radius of sphere = 3/2 = 1.5\n**3. Find the Cone's Volume**\n* Volume of a cone = (1/3) * \u03c0 * (radius of base)\u00b2 * height\n* Volume of the cone = (1/3) * \u03c0 * 3\u00b2 * 4 = 12\u03c0\n**4. Find the Sphere's Volume**\n* Volume of a sphere = (4/3) * \u03c0 * (radius)\u00b3\n* Volume of the sphere = (4/3) * \u03c0 * (1.5)\u00b3 = 4.5\u03c0\n**5. Calculate the Ratio**\n* Ratio of sphere volume to cone volume = (4.5\u03c0) / (12\u03c0) = **3/8**\n**Therefore, the ratio of the volume of the sphere to the volume of the cone is 3:8.** \n"
