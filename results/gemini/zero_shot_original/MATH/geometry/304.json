        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Understanding the Geometry**\n*  Since $\\triangle BEF$ is equilateral, all its angles are 60 degrees.\n*  Angle $ABE$ is 90 degrees (since it's a corner of the square).\n*  Therefore, angle $EAB$ is 30 degrees (90 - 60 = 30).\n**2.  Finding Key Relationships**\n*  Triangle $ABE$ is a 30-60-90 triangle.  This means the sides have a special ratio: \n    * The hypotenuse (AB) is twice the length of the shorter leg (AE).\n    * The longer leg (BE) is $\\sqrt{3}$ times the length of the shorter leg (AE).\n**3.  Using Areas**\n* **Area of  $\\triangle ABE$:**  (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * AE * BE \n* **Area of $\\triangle DEF$:**  (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * DE * EF \n**4.  Expressing Areas in terms of AE**\n*  Let the side length of the square be 's'.  Then AE = s/2.\n*  BE = $\\sqrt{3}$ * AE = $\\sqrt{3}$ * (s/2)\n*  DE = s - AE = s - (s/2) = s/2\n*  EF = BE = $\\sqrt{3}$ * (s/2)\n**5.  Calculating the Ratio**\nNow we can substitute these values into the area formulas:\n* Area of $\\triangle ABE$: (1/2) * (s/2) * ($\\sqrt{3}$ * (s/2)) = (\u221a3/8) * s\u00b2\n* Area of $\\triangle DEF$: (1/2) * (s/2) * ($\\sqrt{3}$ * (s/2)) = (\u221a3/8) * s\u00b2\nThe ratio of the area of $\\triangle DEF$ to the area of $\\triangle ABE$ is:\n[(\u221a3/8) * s\u00b2] / [(\u221a3/8) * s\u00b2] = **1** \n**Therefore, the ratio of the area of $\\triangle DEF$ to that of $\\triangle ABE$ is 1:1.** \n",
        "**1. Finding the Key Relationship**\nSince $\\triangle BEF$ is equilateral, all its angles are 60 degrees.  This means $\\angle ABE = 90^\\circ - 60^\\circ = 30^\\circ$.  Also, $\\angle AEB = 90^\\circ - 60^\\circ = 30^\\circ$.\n**2. Using the 30-60-90 Triangle**\nTriangle $ABE$ is a 30-60-90 triangle.

Finding Area Ratios**\n* **Area of  $\\triangle ABE$:**   Let $x$ be the length of $AE$. Then $AB = 2x$ and $BE = x\\sqrt{3}$.  The area of $\\triangle ABE$ is $\\frac{1}{2}(AE)(BE) = \\frac{1}{2}(x)(x\\sqrt{3}) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}x^2$.\n* **Area of $\\triangle DEF$:**  Since $\\triangle BEF$ is equilateral,  $EF = BE = x\\sqrt{3}$.

Calculating the Ratio**\nThe ratio of the area of $\\triangle DEF$ to the area of $\\triangle ABE$ is:\n$$\\frac{\\frac{1}{2}(10-x)(x\\sqrt{3})}{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}x^2} = \\frac{10-x}{x} = \\boxed{10/x - 1}$$ \n**Important Note:** We can't find a numerical value for the ratio without knowing the exact location of point $E$ (and therefore the value of $x$). \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1.  Understanding the Geometry**\n* **Equilateral Triangle:**  Since triangle *BEF* is equilateral, all its angles are 60 degrees, and all its sides are equal in length.\n* **Square:**  Square *ABCD* has all sides equal and all angles 90 degrees.\n**2.  Key Observations**\n* **Angle Relationships:**  Notice that angle *ABE* is 90 degrees - 60 degrees = 30 degrees. Since *BEF* is equilateral, angle *FEB* is 60 degrees.  Therefore, angle *AEF* = 180 degrees - 30 degrees - 60 degrees = 90 degrees. \n* **Similar Triangles:**  Triangle *AEF* is a right triangle, and triangle *DEF* is also a right triangle.  They share the same hypotenuse (*DF*), and they both have a right angle. This means they are similar triangles.\n**3.  Using Similarity**\n* **Side Ratios:** Because triangles *AEF* and *DEF* are similar, the ratio of their corresponding sides is the same.  Let *BE* = *EF* = *FB* = *x*.  Since *AB* = *BC*,  we have *AE* = *AB* - *BE* = *x*\u221a3 (using the 30-60-90 triangle properties).  Therefore, *DE* = *DF* - *EF* = *x*\u221a3 - *x* = *x*(\u221a3 - 1).\n* **Area Ratios:** The ratio of the areas of similar figures is equal to the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides.  Therefore, the ratio of the area of triangle *DEF* to the area of triangle *ABE* is:\n[Area of triangle *DEF*] / [Area of triangle *ABE*] = (*DE*/ *AE*)\u00b2 = [(\u221a3 - 1) * x / (\u221a3 * x)]\u00b2 = **(4 - 2\u221a3) / 3**\n**Therefore, the ratio of the area of triangle DEF to the area of triangle ABE is (4 - 2\u221a3) / 3.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1.  Understanding the Geometry**\n* Since $\\triangle BEF$ is equilateral, all its angles are 60 degrees.\n*  Angles $\\angle ABE$ and $\\angle CBE$ are 45 degrees (angles of a square).\n*  Therefore,  $\\angle AEB = 180 - 45 - 60 = 75$ degrees.\n**2.  Finding Key Ratios**\n* **Area of  Equilateral Triangle:** The area of an equilateral triangle with side length *s* is  $(\\sqrt{3}/4)s^2$.\n* **Area of a Triangle:** The area of any triangle can be found using the formula (1/2) * base * height. \n**3.  Solving the Problem**\nLet's assume the side length of the square is *s*. \n* **Area of  $\\triangle BEF$:**  Since  $\\triangle BEF$ is equilateral, its area is $(\\sqrt{3}/4)s^2$.\n* **Area of $\\triangle ABE$:**  Let's find the height of $\\triangle ABE$.  Draw a perpendicular from *E* to *AB*, and call the intersection point *G*.  Since $\\angle AEB = 75$ degrees, we have $\\angle AEG = 15$ degrees. Using trigonometry, we get:\n    * $AG = AE \\cos(15^\\circ) = s \\cos(15^\\circ)$.\n    * The area of $\\triangle ABE$ is (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * *s* * *s* * cos(15\u00b0) = (1/2) * *s*\u00b2 * cos(15\u00b0).\n* **Area of $\\triangle DEF$:**  Since $\\triangle BEF$ is equilateral and *EF* is a side of the square, we know that *DE* and *DF* are also equal to *s*. Therefore, $\\triangle DEF$ is also equilateral.  Its area is $(\\sqrt{3}/4)s^2$.\n**4.  Calculating the Ratio**\nThe ratio of the area of $\\triangle DEF$ to the area of $\\triangle ABE$ is:\n[Area of $\\triangle DEF$] / [Area of $\\triangle ABE$] =  [($\\sqrt{3}/4)s^2$] / [(1/2) * *s*\u00b2 * cos(15\u00b0)] = $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2 \\cos(15^\\circ)}$\n**Therefore, the ratio of the area of $\\triangle DEF$ to that of $\\triangle ABE$ is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2 \\cos(15^\\circ)}$.** \n",
