        "1. **Find the radius:**  The radius of the circle is the distance from the center, point $C(3,1)$, to any point on the circle. We can see that the circle passes through the point $(8,1)$.  The distance between these two points is $8-3 = 5$. So, the radius of the circle is 5.\n2. **Use the formula for the area of a circle:** The area of a circle is given by $\\pi r^2$, where $r$ is the radius. \n3. **Substitute the radius:**  Since the radius is 5, the area of the circle is $\\pi (5^2) = \\boxed{25\\pi}$. \n",
        "1. **Find the radius:**  The radius of the circle is the distance from the center $C(3,1)$ to the point $(8,1)$.  Since these points share the same $y$-coordinate, the radius is simply the difference in their $x$-coordinates: $8 - 3 = 5$.\n2. **Use the area formula:** The area of a circle is given by the formula $A = \\pi r^2$, where $r$ is the radius.\n3. **Substitute and simplify:**  Substituting the radius we found, we get $A = \\pi (5)^2 = \\boxed{25\\pi}$. \n",
        "1. **Find the radius:** The circle passes through the point (8, 1), and its center is at (3, 1).  The distance between these two points is the radius of the circle.  The horizontal distance between them is 8 - 3 = 5. So, the radius of the circle is 5.\n2. **Use the formula for the area of a circle:** The area of a circle is given by the formula  Area =  \u03c0 * radius\u00b2.\n3. **Substitute the radius:** In this case, the radius is 5.  Substituting into the formula, we get: Area = \u03c0 * 5\u00b2 = \u03c0 * 25.\n**Therefore, the area of the circle is 25\u03c0.** \n",
        "1. **Find the radius:**  The circle passes through the point $(8,1)$ and has center $(3,1)$.  The distance between these two points is the radius of the circle.

        "1. **Identify the radius:** The radius of the circle is the distance from the center $C(3,1)$ to the point $(8,1)$ on the circle. This distance is 5 units.\n2. **Use the area formula:** The area of a circle is given by the formula  $A = \\pi r^2$, where $r$ is the radius.\n3. **Substitute the radius:**  Since the radius is 5 units, we can substitute it into the formula: $A = \\pi (5)^2$\n4. **Simplify:**  $A = \\pi (25) = \\boxed{25\\pi}$ \n"
