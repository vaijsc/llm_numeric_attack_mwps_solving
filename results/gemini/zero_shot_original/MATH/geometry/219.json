        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n1. **Identify key angles:** We are given that  \u2220BAC = 124\u00b0 and \u2220ABC = x\u00b0.  We want to find the value of x.\n2. **Parallel lines and alternate interior angles:**  Since $\\overline{BC}$ is parallel to the segment through A, we know that \u2220BAC and \u2220ACB are alternate interior angles.  Alternate interior angles are congruent, so \u2220ACB = 124\u00b0.\n3. **Triangle angles:**  The angles inside any triangle add up to 180\u00b0.  In triangle ABC, we have:\n   \u2220ABC + \u2220ACB + \u2220BAC = 180\u00b0\n4. **Solve for x:** Substitute the known angles and solve for x:\n   x\u00b0 + 124\u00b0 + 124\u00b0 = 180\u00b0\n   x\u00b0 = 180\u00b0 - 124\u00b0 - 124\u00b0\n   x\u00b0 = -68\u00b0\n5. **Adjust for a positive angle:**  Since angles are typically measured as positive values, we can add 360\u00b0 to get the equivalent positive angle: \n   x\u00b0 = -68\u00b0 + 360\u00b0 = **292\u00b0**\n**Therefore, the number of degrees represented by x is 292\u00b0.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Identify Key Angles:**\n* Since $\\overline{BC}$ is parallel to the segment through $A$, we have a pair of alternate interior angles: the angle marked $124^\\circ$ and the angle at point $B$ that forms a linear pair with the angle marked $x^\\circ$. \n**2. Find the Angle at Point B:**\n* Alternate interior angles are congruent, so the angle at point $B$ is also $124^\\circ$.\n* Since angles forming a linear pair add up to $180^\\circ$, the angle adjacent to the $124^\\circ$ angle at point $B$ is $180^\\circ - 124^\\circ = 56^\\circ$.\n**3. Utilize Triangle Properties:**\n* Triangle $ABC$ is isosceles because $AB = BC$.  This means the base angles are equal.  Therefore, the angle at point $C$ is also $56^\\circ$.\n**4. Solve for x:**\n* The three angles of any triangle add up to $180^\\circ$.  So, in triangle $ABC$:\n   *  $x^\\circ + 56^\\circ + 56^\\circ = 180^\\circ$\n   *  $x^\\circ = 180^\\circ - 56^\\circ - 56^\\circ = 68^\\circ$\n**Answer:**  Therefore, $x = \\boxed{68}$. \n",
