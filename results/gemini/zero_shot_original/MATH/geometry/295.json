    "solution": "Sum $3a-1$, $a^2+1$, and $a^2+2$ to find $2a^2+3a+2=16$.  Subtract 16 from both sides and factor the left-hand side to find $(2a+7)(a-2)=0\\implies a=-7/2$ or $a=2$.  Discarding the negative solution, we substitute $a=2$ into $3a-1$, $a^2+1$, and $a^2+2$ to find that the side lengths of the triangle are 5, 5, and 6 units.  Draw a perpendicular from the 6-unit side to the opposite vertex to divide the triangle into two congruent right triangles (see figure).  The height of the triangle is $\\sqrt{5^2-3^2}=4$ units, so the area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}(6)(4)=\\boxed{12\\text{ square units}}$.\n\n[asy]\nimport olympiad;\nsize(150);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.8)+fontsize(10));\npair A=(0,0), B=(6,0), C=(3,4);\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(C--(A+B)/2,linetype(\"2 3\"));\nlabel(\"5\",(A+C)/2,unit((-4,3)));\nlabel(\"3\",B/4,S);\ndraw(\"6\",shift((0,-0.6))*(A--B),Bars(5));\ndraw(rightanglemark(A,(A+B)/2,C));[/asy]",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Set up an equation for the perimeter:**\nThe perimeter of a triangle is the sum of its side lengths.  We are given that the perimeter is 16 units, so:\n(3a - 1) + (a\u00b2 + 1) + (a\u00b2 + 2) = 16\n**2. Simplify the equation:**\nCombine like terms:\n2a\u00b2 + 3a + 2 = 16\n**3. Solve the quadratic equation:**\nSubtract 16 from both sides to get a standard quadratic form:\n2a\u00b2 + 3a - 14 = 0\nFactor the quadratic:\n(2a - 7)(a + 2) = 0\nThis gives us two possible solutions:\n* 2a - 7 = 0  =>  a = 7/2\n* a + 2 = 0  =>  a = -2\n**4. Choose the valid solution:**\nSince side lengths cannot be negative, we discard the solution a = -2.  Therefore, a = 7/2.\n**5. Calculate the side lengths:**\nSubstitute a = 7/2 into the expressions for the side lengths:\n* 3a - 1 = 3(7/2) - 1 = 19/2\n* a\u00b2 + 1 = (7/2)\u00b2 + 1 = 53/4\n* a\u00b2 + 2 = (7/2)\u00b2 + 2 = 57/4\n**6.
