    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The diagonal of a square is the hypotenuse of a 45-45-90 right triangle whose legs are the sides of the square.  Therefore, the diagonal of the square measures $12\\sqrt{2}$ units.  The diagonal of the square is a diameter of the circle, so the radius of the circle is $6\\sqrt{2}$ units.  The area of the circle is $\\pi(6\\sqrt{2})^2=72\\pi$, so $K=\\boxed{72}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Problem:**\nImagine a square inscribed inside a circle. The diameter of the circle is equal to the diagonal of the square.\n**2. Find the Diagonal of the Square:**\n* We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the diagonal (which is the hypotenuse of a right triangle formed by two sides of the square): \n   *  diagonal\u00b2 = side\u00b2 + side\u00b2\n   *  diagonal\u00b2 = 12\u00b2 + 12\u00b2 = 288\n   *  diagonal = \u221a288 = 12\u221a2\n**3.  Relate the Diagonal to the Circle's Diameter:**\n* The diagonal of the square is equal to the diameter of the circle.\n**4. Calculate the Circle's Radius:**\n* Radius = Diameter / 2 = (12\u221a2) / 2 = 6\u221a2\n**5. Calculate the Circle's Area:**\n* Area of a circle = \u03c0 * radius\u00b2\n* Area = \u03c0 * (6\u221a2)\u00b2 = \u03c0 * 72 = 72\u03c0\n**6. Determine the Value of K:**\n* Since the area of the circle is 72\u03c0, we know that K = **72**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the problem**\nImagine a square perfectly inside a circle, with each corner of the square touching the circle's edge. \n**2. Find the circle's diameter**\n* The diagonal of the square is equal to the diameter of the circle.\n* We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the diagonal:  a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n   *  In this case, a = 12 and b = 12 (sides of the square)\n   *  So, 12\u00b2 + 12\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n   *  144 + 144 = c\u00b2\n   *  288 = c\u00b2\n   *  c = \u221a288 = 12\u221a2 \n**3. Find the circle's radius**\n* The radius is half the diameter.\n* Radius = (12\u221a2) / 2 = 6\u221a2\n**4. Calculate the circle's area**\n* Area of a circle = \u03c0r\u00b2\n* Area = \u03c0 (6\u221a2)\u00b2\n* Area = \u03c0 (36 * 2)\n* Area = 72\u03c0\n**5.
