Note that $XY=PZ$.\n\n$Q$ is one of the desired points where the semi-circle touches the line above.  Because the diagram is symmetrical, the other point will be the mirror image of $Q$ in line $XP$.  Thus, the required distance is 2 times the length of $PQ$.\n\nNow $PQ=QZ-PZ = QZ-XY$. Since the semi-circle is tangent to the bottom line, and $YO$ is perpendicular to the bottom line and $O$ lies on a diameter, we know that $O$ is the centre of the circle. So $OY=OQ= 8$ cm, since both are radii (or since the centre always lies on a line parallel to the bottom line and a distance of the radius away).\n\nAlso, $OZ=4$ cm, since the distance between the two lines is 12 cm. By the Pythagorean Theorem (since $\\angle QZO=90^\\circ$), then \\[ QZ^2 = QO^2 - ZO^2 = 8^2 - 4^2 = 64 - 16 =48\\]so $QZ = 4\\sqrt{3}$ cm.\n\nAlso, since $QZ:ZO = \\sqrt{3}:1$, then $\\angle QOZ = 60^\\circ$.\n\nThus, the angle from $QO$ to the horizontal is $30^\\circ$, so the semi-circle has rocked through an angle of $30^\\circ$, ie. has rocked through $\\frac{1}{12}$ of a full revolution (if it was a full circle). Thus, the distance of $Y$ from $X$ is $\\frac{1}{12}$ of the circumference of what would be the full circle of radius 8, or $XY=\\frac{1}{12}(2\\pi(8))=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi$ cm.  (We can think of a wheel turning through $30^\\circ$ and the related horizontal distance through which it travels.)\n\nThus, $PQ = QZ-XY = 4\\sqrt{3} - \\frac{4}{3}\\pi$ cm.\n\nTherefore, the required distance is double this, or $8\\sqrt{3}-\\frac{8}{3}\\pi$ cm or about 5.4788 cm, which is closest to $\\boxed{55}$ mm.",

When it touches the top line, it forms a triangle with two radii as sides and the distance between the two points of contact as the base.\n**2. Identify Key Shapes**\n* **Right Triangle:**  The line segment connecting the center of the semi-circle to a point of contact on the top line, the radius of the semi-circle, and the vertical distance from the center of the semi-circle to the top line form a right triangle.\n**3. Use the Pythagorean Theorem**\n* The vertical distance from the center of the semi-circle to the top line is 12 cm - 8 cm = 4 cm.\n* The hypotenuse of the right triangle is the radius of the semi-circle, which is 8 cm.\n* Let the distance from the center of the semi-circle to the point of contact on the top line be *x*. \n* Applying the Pythagorean Theorem: x\u00b2 + 4\u00b2 = 8\u00b2\n* Solving for *x*: x\u00b2 = 64 - 16 = 48\n* Therefore, *x* = \u221a48 cm = 4\u221a3 cm.\n**4. Find the Distance Between the Points of Contact**\n* The distance between the two points of contact is twice the length *x*.\n* Distance = 2 * 4\u221a3 cm = 8\u221a3 cm.\n**5. Convert to Millimeters and Round**\n* 8\u221a3 cm = 8\u221a3 * 10 mm = 80\u221a3 mm \u2248 138.56 mm\n* Rounding to the nearest whole number:  138.56 mm \u2248 **139 mm**.\n**Therefore, the distance between the two points of contact is approximately 139 mm.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Visualize the Situation**\nImagine the semi-circle rocking back and forth.  When it touches the upper line, it forms a triangle with the upper line and the line it sits on. This triangle will be isosceles, with the base of the triangle being the distance between the two points of contact.\n**2. Identify Key Dimensions**\n* **Radius:** The radius of the semi-circle is 8 cm.\n* **Height:** The distance between the lines is 12 cm. \n* **Hypotenuse:** The line segment connecting the center of the semi-circle to a point of contact on the upper line is the hypotenuse of the triangle. \n**3. Use Geometry**\n* **Pythagorean Theorem:** We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse. The height of the triangle is 12 cm, and the other leg of the right triangle is the radius of the semi-circle (8 cm). \n   *  Hypotenuse\u00b2 = 8\u00b2 + 12\u00b2 = 208\n   *  Hypotenuse = \u221a208 = 4\u221a13 cm\n* **Isosceles Triangle:**  The triangle we formed is isosceles, so the hypotenuse is also the length of the equal sides.\n* **Finding the Base:**  We can use the Pythagorean theorem again to find half the base of the triangle:\n    * (1/2 Base)\u00b2 = (Hypotenuse)\u00b2 - (Radius)\u00b2 \n    * (1/2 Base)\u00b2 = (4\u221a13)\u00b2 - 8\u00b2 = 208 - 64 = 144\n    * 1/2 Base = \u221a144 = 12 cm\n    * Base = 2 * 12 cm = 24 cm\n**4. Convert to Millimeters**\n* Since 1 cm = 10 mm, the distance between the two points is 24 * 10 = 240 mm.\n**Answer:** The distance between the two points is **240 mm** (rounded to the nearest whole number). \n",

Identify Relevant Geometry**\n* Triangle OAB is an isosceles triangle (OA = OB = radius of the semi-circle).\n* Triangle OAC is a right triangle (since OC is perpendicular to AB).\n* The distance AB is the chord we want to find. \n**4. Use the Pythagorean Theorem**\n* In triangle OAC, we know OA = 8 cm (the radius) and OC = 12 cm (the distance between the lines).  Let AC = x/2 (half the length of the chord AB).\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem:\n(AC)\u00b2 + (OC)\u00b2 = (OA)\u00b2\n(x/2)\u00b2 + (12)\u00b2 = (8)\u00b2\nx\u00b2/4 + 144 = 64\nx\u00b2/4 = -80\nx\u00b2 = -320 \nSince the length cannot be negative, we know there's an error in our setup.  We made a mistake by adding the squares of the sides directly. The correct approach is to use the fact that OC is perpendicular to AB, which means it bisects AB, and apply the Pythagorean theorem to triangle OAC:\n(OC)\u00b2 + (AC)\u00b2 = (OA)\u00b2\n12\u00b2 + (x/2)\u00b2 = 8\u00b2\n144 + x\u00b2/4 = 64\nx\u00b2/4 = -80\nx\u00b2 = -320\nWe see that we have a negative result for x\u00b2. This means our initial assumption that the semi-circle reaches the upper line is incorrect. The semi-circle is too small to touch the upper line. \n**Therefore, there is no distance between the two points because the semi-circle does not touch the upper line.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Visualize the Setup**\nImagine the semi-circle rocking back and forth. When it touches the top line, it forms a shape like a \"W\" where the two points of contact are the peaks of the \"W\".\n**2. Focus on One \"Peak\"**\nLet's consider one of these points of contact.  Draw a line from the center of the semi-circle to this point. This line will be a radius of the semi-circle (8 cm).\n**3. Right Triangle**\nThe line from the center of the semi-circle to the point of contact, the vertical line from the center to the bottom line, and the line segment connecting the center to the point directly below the point of contact on the bottom line form a right triangle.\n**4.  Use the Pythagorean Theorem**\n* The hypotenuse of this right triangle is the radius of the semi-circle (8 cm).\n* One leg is the distance between the two lines (12 cm).\n* The other leg is the distance from the center of the semi-circle to the point directly below the point of contact on the bottom line (which we want to find).\nLet's call the distance we want to find \"x\".  Using the Pythagorean theorem:\n  x\u00b2 + 12\u00b2 = 8\u00b2\n  x\u00b2 = 8\u00b2 - 12\u00b2 = -64\n  x = \u221a(-64) \nSince we get a negative value under the square root, this means there's no solution in the real numbers.  This tells us that the semi-circle cannot reach the top line without slipping.\n**Conclusion**\nIt's impossible for the semi-circle to rock back and forth without slipping and still touch the top line at two points. Therefore, there is no distance between these two points. \n"
