        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n1. **Understand Cosine:**  In a right triangle, the cosine of an angle is the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse.  Since $\\cos B = \\frac{6}{10}$, we know the side adjacent to angle $B$ has length 6 and the hypotenuse has length 10.\n2. **Find the Opposite Side:**  We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of the side opposite angle $B$ (which is also the side opposite angle $C$):\n   * $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$\n   * $6^2 + b^2 = 10^2$\n   * $36 + b^2 = 100$\n   * $b^2 = 64$\n   * $b = 8$\n3. **Understand Tangent:** The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side.\n4. **Calculate Tangent C:** Since the opposite side to angle $C$ has length 6 and the adjacent side has length 8, we have:\n   * $\\tan C = \\frac{\\text{opposite}}{\\text{adjacent}} = \\frac{6}{8} = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}}$ \n",
