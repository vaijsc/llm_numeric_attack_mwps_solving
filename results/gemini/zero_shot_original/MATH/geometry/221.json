        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Formulas**\n* **Lateral Surface Area (LSA) of a cylinder:**  LSA = 2\u03c0rh, where r is the radius and h is the height.\n* **Volume of a cylinder:** V = \u03c0r\u00b2h\n**2. Set up Equations**\nWe are given:\n* LSA = 3.5 square inches\n* Volume = 3.5 cubic inches\nLet's substitute these values into the formulas:\n* 2\u03c0rh = 3.5 \n* \u03c0r\u00b2h = 3.5\n**3. Solve for h (height)**\n* From the LSA equation, we can solve for h:\n   h = 3.5 / (2\u03c0r)\n**4. Substitute h into the Volume Equation**\n* Substitute the expression for h from step 3 into the volume equation:\n   \u03c0r\u00b2 * (3.5 / (2\u03c0r)) = 3.5\n**5. Simplify and Solve for r**\n* Cancel out \u03c0 and simplify:\n    (3.5r) / 2 = 3.5\n* Multiply both sides by 2:\n    3.5r = 7\n* Divide both sides by 3.5:\n    r = 2\n**Therefore, the radius of the cylinder is 2 inches.** \n",
