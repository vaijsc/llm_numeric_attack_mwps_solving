Similarly, the distance between the centers of Circle 1 and Circle 3 is 2s.\n2. **Circle 4's Center:** Since Circle 4 is tangent to both axes, its center lies on the line y = x.  Also, because it's tangent to Circles 2 and 3, the distance from its center to the center of each of these circles is r + s.\n3. **Right Triangle:**  Consider the right triangle formed by the centers of Circle 1, Circle 2, and Circle 4.  The legs of this triangle have length 2s, and the hypotenuse has length r + s.  We can apply the Pythagorean Theorem:\n   (2s)^2 + (2s)^2 = (r + s)^2\n**Solving for r/s**\nLet's simplify and solve for r/s:\n* 8s^2 = r^2 + 2rs + s^2\n* 7s^2 = r^2 + 2rs\n* 7s^2 = r(r + 2s)\nTo get r/s by itself, divide both sides by s^2(r + 2s):\n* 7 / (r + 2s) = r / s^2\nNow, isolate r/s:\n* **r/s = 7s / (r + 2s)**\nWe can't get a numerical value for r/s without more information.

        "Here's how we can solve the problem:\n**1.

Finding the Key Relationship**\n* **Focus on the centers:** Draw lines connecting the centers of the circles. You'll notice that the centers of the smaller circles form a right triangle, and the center of the larger circle forms a right triangle with the centers of the two smaller circles it touches. \n[asy]\ndraw((0,25)--(0,0)--(25,0),linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(Circle((1,1),1),linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(Circle((3,1),1),linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(Circle((1,3),1),linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(Circle((9,9),9),linewidth(0.7));\ndraw((1,3)--(1,4),dashed);\ndraw((9,9)--(9,0),dashed);\ndraw((-1,3.5)--(1,3.5),dashed);\ndraw((1,1)--(3,1)--(1,3)--cycle,linewidth(0.7));\ndraw((9,9)--(3,1),linewidth(0.7));\ndraw((9,9)--(1,3),linewidth(0.7));\nlabel(\"$s$\",(-1,3.5),W);\nlabel(\"$r$\",(9,4.5),E);\nlabel(\"$(1,1)$\",(1,1),SW);\nlabel(\"$(3,1)$\",(3,1),S);\nlabel(\"$(1,3)$\",(1,3),W);\nlabel(\"$(9,9)$\",(9,9),NE);\n[/asy]\n* **The triangles' sides:**\n    * The smaller right triangle has legs of length 2*s*.\n    * The larger right triangle has legs of length *r* + *s*.\n**3. Using the Pythagorean Theorem**\n* **Smaller triangle:** (2*s*)\u00b2 + (2*s*)\u00b2 = (hypotenuse)\u00b2\n* **Larger triangle:** (r + s)\u00b2 + (r + s)\u00b2 = (hypotenuse)\u00b2\n**4. Solving for the Hypotenuse**\n* Both triangles share the same hypotenuse, which is the distance between the centers of the two smaller circles that are tangent to the larger circle.\n* Simplifying the Pythagorean equations, we get:\n    * 8*s\u00b2 = (hypotenuse)\u00b2\n    * 2(r + s)\u00b2 = (hypotenuse)\u00b2\n**5. Finding the Ratio r/s**\n* Equating the two expressions for (hypotenuse)\u00b2, we get: 8*s\u00b2 = 2(r + s)\u00b2\n* Expanding and simplifying: 4*s\u00b2 = (r + s)\u00b2\n* Taking the square root of both sides: 2*s = r + s\n* Solving for *r*: r = s\n* Therefore, r/s = **1**. \n",
        "Here's a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n**1.  Understanding the Setup**\nImagine the three smaller circles of radius *s* nestled in the first quadrant. The first circle is centered at (s, s), the second at (3s, s), and the third at (s, 3s).\n**2. Finding the Center of the Larger Circle**\nThe larger circle of radius *r* is tangent to both axes. This means its center lies on the line *y = x*.  Furthermore, it's tangent to the second and third smaller circles.  This tells us the distance from the center of the larger circle to the centers of the second and third smaller circles is *r + s*.\n**3. Using the Distance Formula**\nLet the center of the larger circle be (a, a).  We can use the distance formula to set up two equations:\n* Distance from (a, a) to (3s, s) = *r + s*\n   \u221a[(a - 3s)\u00b2 + (a - s)\u00b2] = *r + s*\n* Distance from (a, a) to (s, 3s) = *r + s*\n   \u221a[(a - s)\u00b2 + (a - 3s)\u00b2] = *r + s*\n**4. Solving for 'a'**\nNotice that the two equations are identical.  Let's simplify and solve for *a*:\n(a - 3s)\u00b2 + (a - s)\u00b2 = (*r + s*)\u00b2\n2a\u00b2 - 8as + 10s\u00b2 = r\u00b2 + 2rs + s\u00b2\n2a\u00b2 - 8as + 9s\u00b2 - r\u00b2 - 2rs = 0\nSince the larger circle is tangent to both axes, the center (a, a) must be in the first quadrant.  This means *a > 0*.  We can use the quadratic formula to solve for *a*, but we're really interested in the ratio *r/s*, so let's try to manipulate the equation to get it in terms of *r/s*.\n**5. Expressing 'a' in terms of 'r' and 's'**\nDivide the entire equation by *s\u00b2*:\n2(a/s)\u00b2 - 8(a/s) + 9 - (r/s)\u00b2 - 2(r/s) = 0\nLet *x = a/s* and *y = r/s*:\n2x\u00b2 - 8x + 9 - y\u00b2 - 2y = 0\n**6. Recognizing a Difference of Squares**\nRearranging terms:\n2x\u00b2 - 8x + 9 = y\u00b2 + 2y\nNotice the right side is almost a perfect square.  Completing the square:\n2x\u00b2 - 8x + 9 = (y + 1)\u00b2 - 1\n**7. Finding the Relationship between 'x' and 'y'**\nNow, let's manipulate to get a relationship between *x* and *y*:\n2x\u00b2 - 8x + 10 = (y + 1)\u00b2 \n2(x\u00b2 - 4x + 5) = (y + 1)\u00b2\n2[(x - 2)\u00b2 + 1] = (y + 1)\u00b2\nSince *x = a/s* and *a > 0*, we know *x > 0*. Therefore:\n\u221a2(x - 2)\u00b2 + \u221a2 = y + 1\n\u221a2(x - 2)\u00b2 - 1 = y\n**8. Solving for 'r/s'**\nRecall that *x = a/s* and *y = r/s*.  Substituting back:\n\u221a2(a/s - 2)\u00b2 - 1 = r/s\nSince the center of the larger circle is on the line *y = x*,  we know *a = r*.  Substituting *a = r*:\n\u221a2(r/s - 2)\u00b2 - 1 = r/s\nLet *k = r/s*:\n\u221a2(k - 2)\u00b2 - 1 = k\n**9. Solving the Equation**\nSquaring both sides:\n2(k - 2)\u00b2 - 2\u221a2(k - 2) + 1 = k\u00b2\n2k\u00b2 - 8k + 8 - 2\u221a2(k - 2) + 1 = k\u00b2\nk\u00b2 - 8k + 9 - 2\u221a2(k - 2) = 0\nThis equation is still tricky to solve directly. However, we can use the fact that the solution *k = r/s* must be positive, and try plugging in values to see what works.  If we try *k = 5*, we find that it satisfies the equation:\n5\u00b2 - 8(5) + 9 - 2\u221a2(5 - 2) = 0\n**10. The Answer**\nTherefore, the ratio *r/s* is **5**. \n",
        "Let's break down the problem and find the solution step-by-step:\n**1. Understanding the Geometry**\n* **Circle 1:**  The first circle, centered at (s, s), is tangent to both the x and y-axes. Its radius is 's'.\n* **Circles 2 and 3:**  The second and third circles are also of radius 's'. They are tangent to the first circle and the x-axis (for circle 2) or the y-axis (for circle 3).  This means their centers lie on lines parallel to the axes, a distance 's' away.\n* **Circle 4:** The larger circle, with radius 'r', is tangent to both axes and the second and third circles.\n**2. Finding the Center of the Larger Circle**\n* **Distance from axes:** Since the large circle is tangent to both axes, its center lies on the line y = x.\n* **Distance from circles 2 and 3:**  The distance from the center of the large circle to the centers of circles 2 and 3 is r + s. This means the center of the large circle is a distance r + s away from both the line x = s and the line y = s.\n**3. Using Geometry to Find the Relationship**\n* **Consider a right triangle:** Draw a line segment from the center of the large circle to the point where it is tangent to the x-axis.  Also draw a line segment from the center of the large circle to the center of circle 2. These two lines, along with the line x = s, form a right triangle.\n* **Using Pythagorean Theorem:** The legs of this triangle have lengths r and s + r, and the hypotenuse has length s + r + s = 2s + r. Applying the Pythagorean Theorem:\n   (s + r)\u00b2 + r\u00b2 = (2s + r)\u00b2\n* **Solving for r/s:** Expanding and simplifying the equation:\n   s\u00b2 + 2rs + r\u00b2 + r\u00b2 = 4s\u00b2 + 4rs + r\u00b2\n   2r\u00b2 - 2rs - 3s\u00b2 = 0\n   (2r + s)(r - 3s) = 0\n   Since r > s, the only valid solution is r - 3s = 0.\n   Therefore, r = 3s, and **r/s = 3**.\n**Answer:** The ratio r/s is **3**. \n"
