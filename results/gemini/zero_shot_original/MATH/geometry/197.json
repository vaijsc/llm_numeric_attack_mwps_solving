        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understanding Perpendicular Bisectors**\n* The perpendicular bisector of a line segment is a line that passes through the midpoint of the segment and is perpendicular to it.\n* Since $O$ lies on the perpendicular bisectors of both $BC$ and $AC$, this means $OB = OC$ and $OA = OC$.\n**2. Equilateral Triangle**\n* Because $OA = OB = OC$, triangle $OAB$ is an equilateral triangle.  Therefore, $\\angle AOB = 60^\\circ$.\n**3. Finding Angles in Triangle OCM**\n* Since $M$ is the midpoint of $BC$ and $O$ lies on the perpendicular bisector of $BC$,  we know that $OM$ is perpendicular to $BC$. \n* Therefore, $\\angle OMC = 90^\\circ$.\n*  In triangle $OCM$, we have $\\angle OCM = \\frac{1}{2} \\angle ACB = 23.5^\\circ$ (since $O$ lies on the perpendicular bisector of $AC$).\n* Using the angle sum property of triangles, we find $\\angle COM = 180^\\circ - 90^\\circ - 23.5^\\circ = 66.5^\\circ$.\n**4. Finding Angle MON**\n* Finally, in triangle $MON$, we have:\n    * $\\angle MON = \\angle AOB - \\angle COM - \\angle BOM = 60^\\circ - 66.5^\\circ - 66.5^\\circ = \\boxed{-73^\\circ}$.\n**Important Note:**  The angle measure of $\\angle MON$ is negative. This is because the angle is measured clockwise from $MO$ to $ON$. In a standard angle measurement system, we would typically express this as a positive angle by adding $360^\\circ$: $-73^\\circ + 360^\\circ = 287^\\circ$. \n",

Understanding Perpendicular Bisectors**\n* The perpendicular bisector of a line segment is a line that passes through the midpoint of the segment and is perpendicular to it. \n*  Since $O$ lies on the perpendicular bisectors of $BC$ and $AC$, it means:\n    * $OB = OC$ (because $O$ is equidistant from the endpoints of $BC$)\n    * $OA = OC$ (because $O$ is equidistant from the endpoints of $AC$)\n**2.  Identifying Key Triangles**\nWe can see that triangles $BOC$ and $COA$ are isosceles triangles.\n**3. Finding Angles**\n* Since $M$ is the midpoint of $BC$, we know that $BM = CM$.  Also, $OB = OC$ (from step 1). Therefore, triangle $BOM$ is congruent to triangle $COM$ (by SSS congruence). This means:\n    *  $\\angle BOM = \\angle COM$ \n* Similarly, in triangle $AON$ and $CON$, we have:\n    * $\\angle AON = \\angle CON$\n**4.  Calculating $\\angle MON$**\n* Let's look at triangle $AOC$. We know that  $\\angle AOC = \\angle AON + \\angle CON = 2 \\angle AON$.\n* Also, $\\angle AOC = 180^\\circ - \\angle CAO - \\angle ACO$.  Since triangle $COA$ is isosceles, we have $\\angle CAO = \\angle ACO = \\frac{1}{2} (180^\\circ - \\angle C) = \\frac{1}{2} (180^\\circ - 47^\\circ) = 66.5^\\circ$. \n* Therefore, $\\angle AOC = 180^\\circ - 66.5^\\circ - 66.5^\\circ = 47^\\circ$.\n*  So, $2 \\angle AON = 47^\\circ$, which means $\\angle AON = 23.5^\\circ$.\n**5. Final Calculation**\n* Finally, $\\angle MON = \\angle BOM + \\angle AON = \\angle COM + \\angle AON = \\frac{1}{2} \\angle BOC + \\angle AON$.  Since $\\angle BOC = 180^\\circ - \\angle C = 180^\\circ - 47^\\circ = 133^\\circ$, we have:\n* $\\angle MON = \\frac{1}{2} (133^\\circ) + 23.5^\\circ = \\boxed{89.5^\\circ}$ \n",

Isosceles Triangles**\n* Since $OB = OC$, triangle $BOC$ is isosceles.\n* Since $OA = OC$, triangle $AOC$ is isosceles.\n**3. Angles in Isosceles Triangles**\n* In isosceles triangles, the base angles (the angles opposite the equal sides) are equal.  Therefore:\n    * $\\angle OBC = \\angle OCB$\n    * $\\angle OAC = \\angle OCA$\n**4. Finding Angles Around Point C**\n* The angles around point $C$ add up to $360^\\circ$.  We know $\\angle ACB = 47^\\circ$.  Using the facts from step 3, we can write:\n    * $\\angle OCB + \\angle OCA + \\angle ACB = 360^\\circ$\n    * $\\angle OBC + \\angle OAC + 47^\\circ = 360^\\circ$\n    * $\\angle OBC + \\angle OAC = 313^\\circ$\n**5. Finding Angles in Triangle MON**\n* Since $M$ and $N$ are midpoints, line segment $MN$ is parallel to line segment $AB$ (by the Midsegment Theorem).\n* Therefore, $\\angle MON$ is equal to the alternate interior angle $\\angle BAC$.\n* We can find $\\angle BAC$ by using the fact that the angles in triangle $ABC$ add up to $180^\\circ$:\n    * $\\angle BAC + \\angle ABC + \\angle ACB = 180^\\circ$\n    * $\\angle BAC + \\angle OBC + 47^\\circ = 180^\\circ$  (using the fact that $\\angle ABC = \\angle OBC$)\n    * $\\angle BAC = 133^\\circ - \\angle OBC$\n**6. Finding Angle MON**\n* Since $\\angle MON = \\angle BAC$, and we know $\\angle BAC = 133^\\circ - \\angle OBC$, we need to find $\\angle OBC$.\n* Remember that $\\angle OBC + \\angle OAC = 313^\\circ$.  Since triangle $AOC$ is isosceles, $\\angle OAC = \\angle OCA$, and the angles in triangle $AOC$ add up to $180^\\circ$.  Therefore:\n    * $\\angle OAC + \\angle OCA + \\angle COA = 180^\\circ$\n    * $2 \\angle OAC + \\angle COA = 180^\\circ$\n    * $2 \\angle OBC + \\angle COA = 180^\\circ$  (since $\\angle OAC = \\angle OBC$)\n    * $\\angle COA = 180^\\circ - 2 \\angle OBC$\n* Now we have two equations with two unknowns:\n    * $\\angle OBC + \\angle OAC = 313^\\circ$\n    * $\\angle COA = 180^\\circ - 2 \\angle OBC$\n* Solving for $\\angle OBC$, we get $\\angle OBC = 67^\\circ$.\n* Finally, we can find $\\angle MON$:\n    * $\\angle MON = \\angle BAC = 133^\\circ - \\angle OBC = 133^\\circ - 67^\\circ = \\boxed{66^\\circ}$. \n",

Understanding Perpendicular Bisectors**\n* The perpendicular bisector of a line segment is a line that is perpendicular to the segment and passes through its midpoint.\n* A key property is that all points on the perpendicular bisector are equidistant from the endpoints of the segment.\n**2. Applying the Property to Our Triangle**\n* Since $O$ lies on the perpendicular bisector of $BC$, we have $OB = OC$.\n* Similarly, since $O$ lies on the perpendicular bisector of $AC$, we have $OA = OC$.\n**3.

Substituting our expressions, we get\n\\begin{align*}\n\\angle MON &= (90^\\circ - \\angle MOB) + (180^\\circ - 2 \\angle OBC) + (90^\\circ - \\angle NOC) \\\\\n&= 360^\\circ - \\angle MOB - 2 \\angle OBC - \\angle NOC \\\\\n&= 360^\\circ - (\\angle MOB + \\angle NOC) - 2 \\angle OBC.\n\\end{align*}Since $\\angle MOB + \\angle NOC = \\angle BOC = 180^\\circ - 2 \\angle OBC$, we have\n\\[\\angle MON = 360^\\circ - (180^\\circ - 2 \\angle OBC) - 2 \\angle OBC = \\boxed{180^\\circ}.\\]",
