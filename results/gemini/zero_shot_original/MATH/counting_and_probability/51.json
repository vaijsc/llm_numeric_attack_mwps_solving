    "solution": "There are a total of $6^3=216$ possible sets of dice rolls. If one of the re-rolled dice matches the pair we set aside and the other two form a pair, we will have a full house. But we will also have a full house if all three re-rolled dice come up the same.\n\nConsider the first case. There are $3$ ways to pick which of the three dice will match a pair, and then $5$ ways to pick a value for the other two dice so that they form a pair (but don't match the first three dice), for a total of $3\\cdot 5=15$ possible outcomes, plus the outcome that all five dice match.\n\nIn the second case, we need all three dice to match each other. There are $5$ ways to pick which value the three dice will have so that they don't match the first pair, plus the outcome that all five dice match.\n\nSo there are a total of $15+5=20$ ways to get a full house without all five dice matching, added to the possibility that all five dice match, which makes $21$ ways to get a full house. So, the probability is $$\\frac{\\text{successful outcomes}}{\\text{total outcomes}}=\\frac{21}{216}=\\boxed{\\frac{7}{72}}.$$",

        "Here's how to break down the probability calculation step-by-step:\n**1. Initial Roll:**\n* **Probability of getting a pair:**  We need two dice to match. There are 6 ways to choose the value for the pair (1, 1), (2, 2), ... (6, 6).  \n   * For each chosen value, there are 5C2 = 10 ways to select the two dice that will show that value.\n   * The remaining three dice need to be different from each other and the pair. There are 5 choices for the first, 4 for the second, and 3 for the third.\n   * Total possibilities for the initial roll: 6 * 10 * 5 * 4 * 3 = 3600\n   * Total possible outcomes of the initial roll: 6 * 6 * 6 * 6 * 6 = 7776\n   * Probability of getting a pair on the initial roll: 3600 / 7776 = 5/11\n**2. Second Roll:**\n* **To get a full house, we need to get a three-of-a-kind with the three dice that were re-rolled.**\n   * There are 4 choices for the value of the three-of-a-kind (it can't be the same as the pair).\n   * Probability of getting three-of-a-kind: 1/6 * 1/6 * 1/6 = 1/216 \n* **We also need to get a pair with the two dice that were initially set aside.** \n   * The probability of getting the same value on both of these dice is 1/6.\n**3. Combining the Probabilities:**\n* The probability of getting a full house after the second roll is the product of the probabilities of these two events: (1/216) * (1/6) = 1/1296\n**Therefore, the probability of getting a full house after the second set of rolls is 1/1296.** \n",
        "Here's how to break down the probability calculation:\n**Step 1: The Initial Roll**\n* We need a pair and three different numbers.  \n* The probability of getting a pair on the first roll is: (6/6) * (1/6) = 1/6 (we can get any number for the first die, but then need a match for the second).\n* The probability of getting three different numbers after getting a pair is: (4/6) * (3/6) * (2/6) = 1/18 (we have 4 options for the third die, then 3 for the fourth, and 2 for the fifth).\n* The probability of the initial roll meeting our criteria is (1/6) * (1/18) = 1/108\n**Step 2: The Second Roll**\n* We need to get a three-of-a-kind and a pair from the three dice we re-roll.\n* There are three possible outcomes:\n    * **Outcome 1:** The three dice land on the same number (a triple). This happens with a probability of (1/6) * (1/6) = 1/36.\n    * **Outcome 2:** Two dice land on the same number, and the third is different. This happens with a probability of (3/6) * (1/6) * (5/6) = 5/72 (choose one of the three numbers, then match it, then roll a different number).\n    * **Outcome 3:** All three dice land on different numbers. This happens with a probability of (5/6) * (4/6) * (3/6) = 5/18.\n**Step 3: Combining the Probabilities**\n* For the full house, we need outcome 1 or outcome 2.\n* The probability of a full house after the second roll is: (1/36) + (5/72) = 1/9.\n**Step 4: The Overall Probability**\n* To get the overall probability of a full house, we multiply the probability of the initial roll by the probability of a full house on the second roll:\n(1/108) * (1/9) = **1/972** \nTherefore, the probability of getting a full house after the second set of rolls is **1/972**. \n",
        "Here's how to break down the probability calculation step by step:\n**1. Initial Roll: Getting the Pair**\n* There are 6 possible outcomes for the first die.\n* The second die must match the first, so there's only 1 favorable outcome.\n* The remaining three dice must be different from each other and the pair.  There are 5 choices for the third die, 4 for the fourth, and 3 for the fifth.\nThe probability of getting a pair on the initial roll is: (6 * 1 * 5 * 4 * 3) / 6^5 = 5/108\n**2. Second Roll: Getting the Full House**\n* We need to consider the three dice that were re-rolled. \n*  To get a full house, two of these dice must match each other and the third die must match the pair that was set aside.\n* There are 3 ways to choose which of the three dice will match the pair (we'll call this the 'trio').\n* The other two dice must match each other (we'll call this the 'pair'). There are 5 choices for the value of this matching pair.\nThe probability of getting a full house on the second roll is: (3 * 5 * 1) / 6^3 = 5/72\n**3. Overall Probability**\nTo find the overall probability of getting a full house, we multiply the probabilities of each step:\n(5/108) * (5/72) = **25/7776** \n",

        "Here's how to break down the probability calculation step-by-step:\n**1. Initial Roll: The Pair**\n* **Possible Pairs:** There are 6 possible values for the pair (1-1, 2-2, ..., 6-6).\n* **Ways to Choose the Pair:**  Since order doesn't matter (getting a 3 then a 3 is the same as a 3 then a 3), we use combinations. There are \u2075C\u2082 = 10 ways to choose 2 dice out of 5.\n**2. Initial Roll: The Remaining Three**\n* **Possible Values:** There are 5 remaining values that the three dice can show (since one value is used for the pair).\n* **Ways to Arrange Three Different Values:** There are 3! = 6 ways to arrange 3 different values.\n**3. Second Roll: The Full House**\n* **Probability of Getting a Three-of-a-Kind:**  To get three of a kind, we need to roll the same value on all three dice. There's a 1/6 chance of rolling any specific value, so the probability is (1/6) * (1/6) * (1/6) = 1/216.\n* **Probability of Getting a Pair:** To get a pair, we need to roll the same value on two of the dice. There's a 1/6 chance of rolling any specific value, and \u2075C\u2082 = 10 ways to choose which two dice will show that value. So the probability is 10 * (1/6) * (1/6) = 5/18.\n**4. Putting it Together**\nTo find the overall probability, we need to consider the possibilities for each step and multiply the probabilities:\n* **Probability of a Specific Full House:** The probability of getting a specific full house (e.g., three 4s and two 2s) is: \n   * (Probability of the pair) * (Probability of three different values) * (Probability of three-of-a-kind) * (Probability of a pair) = \n   * (1/6) * (6/216) * (1/216) * (5/18) = 5/46656\n* **Number of Possible Full Houses:** There are 6 possible pairs (1-1 through 6-6), and for each pair, there are 5 remaining values that the three-of-a-kind can be. So there are 6 * 5 = 30 possible full houses.\n* **Total Probability:**  The total probability of getting a full house is:\n   * (Probability of a specific full house) * (Number of possible full houses) =\n   * (5/46656) * (30) = **150/46656**\n**Simplified:**  The probability can be simplified to approximately **0.0032** or about **0.32%**. \n"
