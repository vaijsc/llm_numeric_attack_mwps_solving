        "Here's how we can solve this problem:\n**1.  Understanding the Problem**\nWe need to find the average number of cards that will be sandwiched between the two jokers after the deck is shuffled. \n**2.  Possible Positions**\nImagine the 54 cards laid out in a row. The two jokers can occupy any of the 54 positions.  Let's focus on the positions of the jokers, and let's say the first joker is in position *j*. \n* If the second joker is in position *j* + 1, there are 0 cards in between.\n* If the second joker is in position *j* + 2, there is 1 card in between.\n* ...\n* If the second joker is in position *j* + 52, there are 51 cards in between.\n**3.  Calculating Probabilities**\nSince the jokers are randomly placed, each possible position for the second joker is equally likely.  \n* The probability that the second joker is in position *j* + 1 is 1/53.\n* The probability that the second joker is in position *j* + 2 is 1/53.\n* ...\n* The probability that the second joker is in position *j* + 52 is 1/53.\n**4.  Expected Value**\nThe expected number of cards between the jokers is the average of all the possible numbers of cards, weighted by their probabilities.  This is essentially the same as calculating the average of the numbers 0, 1, 2, ..., 51.\nThe average of a sequence of consecutive numbers is equal to the average of the first and last number. So, the average of 0, 1, 2, ..., 51 is (0 + 51)/2 = 25.5\n**Answer:**\nThe expected number of cards strictly between the two jokers is **25.5**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1.  Possible Positions of the Jokers**\nImagine the 54 cards laid out in a row.  There are 54 possible positions for the first joker, and then 53 possible positions for the second joker (since it can't be in the same spot as the first).  So there are a total of 54 * 53 = 2862 ways to place the two jokers.\n**2.  Calculating the Number of Cards Between**\nFor each arrangement of the jokers, we want to count the number of cards that fall between them.  Let's consider a few examples:\n* **Joker, Joker:** 0 cards between\n* **Joker, Card, Joker:** 1 card between\n* **Joker, Card, Card, Joker:** 2 cards between\n* **Joker, ..., Joker:** 52 cards between\n**3.  Symmetry and Average**\nNotice that the problem is symmetric.  The number of cards between the jokers is the same whether the first joker is on the left or the right.  So, we can focus on just one of the jokers and calculate the average number of cards between it and the other joker.\n**4.  Averaging the Positions**\nImagine the first joker is in a fixed position.  The second joker could be in any of the remaining 53 positions.  \n* **Best Case:** The second joker is right next to the first, resulting in 0 cards between them.\n* **Worst Case:** The second joker is at the other end of the deck, resulting in 52 cards between them.\nOn average, the second joker will be placed halfway between these extremes.  This means, on average, there will be **(0 + 52)/2 = 26** cards between the two jokers.\n**Answer:** The expected number of cards strictly between the two jokers is **26**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step by step:\n**1.  Think About the Possibilities**\nImagine the two jokers are placed somewhere in the deck.  There are 53 possible positions for the first joker (since it can be anywhere from the top to the bottom of the deck). Once the first joker is placed, there are 52 possible positions for the second joker.\n**2.  Calculate the Average Number of Cards Between the Jokers**\n* **Best Case:**  The jokers are next to each other. In this case, there are zero cards between them.\n* **Worst Case:** The jokers are at the extreme ends of the deck. In this case, there are 52 cards between them.\n* **Average Case:** Since the jokers are placed randomly, we can expect the average number of cards between them to be the average of all the possible cases. \nTo find the average, we can sum the number of cards between the jokers in each possible arrangement and divide by the total number of arrangements.  However, this would be a very tedious calculation.\n**3.  Use Symmetry**\nInstead of directly calculating the average, let's use symmetry.  Consider the positions of the jokers in relation to the first joker.  For every arrangement where there are _k_ cards between the jokers, there's a mirrored arrangement with _k_ cards between them as well.  \n* **Example:** If the first joker is in position 10 and the second joker is in position 20, there are 10 cards between them.  There's also an arrangement where the first joker is in position 44 and the second joker is in position 34, also with 10 cards between them.\nThis means that the average number of cards between the jokers will be equal to the average distance between the first joker and the middle of the deck.  Since the deck has 54 cards, the middle is at card number 27.5. \n**4.  Calculate the Expected Value**\nThe first joker is equally likely to be in any of the 54 positions.  Therefore, the expected number of cards between the jokers is:\n(1/54) * (0 + 1 + 2 + ... + 26 + 27 + 26 + 25 + ... + 1 + 0) \nThis sum can be simplified using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:\n(1/54) * [(27 * 53) / 2] = **26.5**\n**Therefore, the expected number of cards strictly between the two jokers is 26.5.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Visualize the Setup**\nImagine the 54 cards laid out in a row.  We need to find the expected number of cards between the two jokers.\n**2.  Possible Locations of the Jokers**\nSince the jokers can be anywhere in the deck, let's focus on the positions of the jokers.  There are 54 possible positions for the first joker, and then 53 possible positions for the second joker (since it can't be in the same spot).\n**3.  Counting Favorable Cases**\nTo count the number of cards between the jokers, we need to consider the different positions of the jokers:\n* **Case 1: Joker 1 is first**\n   * There are 52 cards between the jokers.\n* **Case 2: Joker 1 is second**\n   * There are 51 cards between the jokers.\n* **Case 3: Joker 1 is third**\n   * There are 50 cards between the jokers.\n* **... and so on**\n* **Case 52: Joker 1 is 52nd**\n   * There is 1 card between the jokers.\n* **Case 53: Joker 1 is 53rd**\n   * There are 0 cards between the jokers.\n**4.  Calculating the Expected Value**\nThe expected value is calculated as the average number of cards between the jokers, taking into account the probability of each case.\n* **Probability of each case:** Since the deck is shuffled randomly, each of the 54 possible positions for the first joker and 53 possible positions for the second joker are equally likely.  \n* **Calculation:**\n    * The sum of the number of cards between the jokers (52 + 51 + 50 + ... + 1 + 0) is the same as the sum of the numbers from 1 to 52.  This sum is (52 * 53) / 2 = 1378.\n    * The total number of possible arrangements of the jokers is 54 * 53.\n    * Expected value = (Sum of cards between jokers) / (Total arrangements) = 1378 / (54 * 53) = 26 / 53.\n**Therefore, the expected number of cards strictly between the two jokers is 26/53.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Possible Positions of the Jokers**\nImagine the 54 cards laid out in a row.  There are 54 possible positions for the first joker.  Once the first joker is placed, there are 53 positions left for the second joker.  This gives us a total of  54 * 53 = 2862 possible arrangements of the jokers.\n**2.  Calculating Favorable Arrangements**\nWe want to find the number of arrangements where there are *k* cards between the two jokers.  To do this:\n* **Choose the position of the first joker:** There are 54 options.\n* **Choose the position of the second joker:** To have *k* cards between them, the second joker must be *k + 1* positions away from the first. So there are 54 - (k + 1) = 53 - *k* options. \nTherefore, there are 54 * (53 - *k*) arrangements where there are *k* cards between the jokers.\n**3.  Probability of Each Arrangement**\nThe probability of any specific arrangement of the jokers is 1/2862 (since there are 2862 total possible arrangements).\n**4.  Expected Value**\nThe expected number of cards between the jokers is the sum of the number of cards between them in each arrangement, weighted by the probability of that arrangement.  \nLet's use the variable *E* to represent the expected number of cards between the jokers:\n*E* = (0 * Probability of 0 cards between jokers) + (1 * Probability of 1 card between jokers) + (2 * Probability of 2 cards between jokers) + ... + (52 * Probability of 52 cards between jokers)\nUsing the probabilities we calculated above, we can write this as:\n*E* = (0 * (54 * 53 / 2862)) + (1 * (54 * 52 / 2862)) + (2 * (54 * 51 / 2862)) + ... + (52 * (54 * 1 / 2862))\n**5.  Simplifying the Expression**\nNotice that we can factor out a 54/2862 from each term:\n*E* = (54/2862) * (0 * 53 + 1 * 52 + 2 * 51 + ... + 52 * 1)\nThe sum inside the parentheses is a bit tricky, but there's a helpful pattern.  It's similar to a sum of consecutive integers, but with each term multiplied by its corresponding position.  We can find a formula for this type of sum, but for simplicity, we can use a calculator or spreadsheet to compute the sum: \n0 * 53 + 1 * 52 + 2 * 51 + ... + 52 * 1 = 7806\n**6.  Final Calculation**\nNow we can substitute back into our expression for *E*:\n*E* = (54/2862) * 7806 \n*E* = 26\n**Answer:** The expected number of cards strictly between the two jokers is **26**. \n"
