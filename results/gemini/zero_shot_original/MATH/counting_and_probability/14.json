    "solution": "We do this problem with three cases.\n\nCase 1: 4 girls, 2 boys on the team.\n\nWith 4 girls on the team, there are $\\binom{8}{4} = 70$ ways to pick the girls, and $\\binom{6}{2} = 15$ ways to pick the boys, for a total of $70 \\times 15 = 1050$.\n\nCase 2: 5 girls, 1 boy on the team.  With 5 girls on the team, there are $\\binom{8}{5} = 56$ ways to pick the girls, and $\\binom{6}{1} = 6$ ways to pick the boy, for a total of $56 \\times 6 = 336$.\n\nCase 3: 6 girls on the team. With 6 girls on the team, there are $\\binom{8}{6} = 28$ ways to pick the girls on the team.\n\nThis gives us a sum of $1050 + 336 + 28 = \\boxed{1414}$.",

        "Here's how to break down the problem step by step:\n**1.  Consider the possible team compositions:**\n* **4 girls, 2 boys:** This is the only combination where girls outnumber boys.\n**2. Calculate the number of ways to choose each team composition:**\n* **4 girls, 2 boys:**\n   * Ways to choose 4 girls out of 8:  \u2078C\u2084 = (8!)/(4!4!) = 70\n   * Ways to choose 2 boys out of 6: \u2076C\u2082 = (6!)/(2!4!) = 15\n   * Total ways to form a team with 4 girls and 2 boys: 70 * 15 = 1050\n**3.  The final answer:**\nSince the only way to have more girls than boys is with a team of 4 girls and 2 boys, there are **1050** ways to select a team with more girls than boys. \n",

Consider the possible girl-to-boy ratios:**\n* **4 girls, 2 boys:**  This is the only way to have more girls than boys with a 6-person team.\n**2. Calculate the number of ways to choose each group:**\n* **Choosing 4 girls:** We have 8 girls and need to choose 4. This is a combination problem, and we can calculate it as  \u2078C\u2084 = (8!)/(4!4!) = 70. \n* **Choosing 2 boys:** We have 6 boys and need to choose 2. This is also a combination: \u2076C\u2082 = (6!)/(2!4!) = 15.\n**3. Multiply to find the total number of ways:**\nSince we need to choose both the girls and the boys, we multiply the number of ways to choose each group: 70 * 15 = **1050**\n**Therefore, there are 1050 ways to select a team with more girls than boys.** \n",
