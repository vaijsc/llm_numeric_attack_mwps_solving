        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n* **Figure 1:** Has 3 segments.\n* **Figure 2:** Has 5 segments (2 more than Figure 1).\n* **Figure 3:** Has 7 segments (2 more than Figure 2).\nWe see a pattern: each figure uses 2 more segments than the previous one.\nTo find the number of segments in Figure 25, we can think of this as an arithmetic sequence:\n* The first term is 3 (segments in Figure 1).\n* The common difference is 2 (we add 2 segments for each new figure).\nThe formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is:  a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d \nWhere:\n* a_n is the nth term (the number of segments in Figure 25)\n* a_1 is the first term (3)\n* n is the term number (25)\n* d is the common difference (2)\nLet's plug in the values:\na_25 = 3 + (25 - 1)2\na_25 = 3 + 48\na_25 = 51\n**Therefore, Figure 25 of the sequence must use 51 congruent segments.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n* **Figure 1:** Has 3 segments (forming one triangle).\n* **Figure 2:** Has 5 segments (forming two triangles).\n* **Figure 3:** Has 7 segments (forming three triangles).\nNotice a pattern: each figure adds 2 segments to the previous figure.  This is because each new triangle requires two additional sides, while one side is shared with the previous triangle.\n* **The pattern:** We can represent this pattern with the equation:  **Segments = 2 * (Number of Triangles) + 1**\nTo find the number of segments in Figure 25, we substitute:\n* **Segments = 2 * (25) + 1**\n* **Segments = 50 + 1**\n* **Segments = 51**\n**Therefore, 51 congruent segments must be used to make Figure 25 of the sequence.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n* **Figure 1:** Has 3 segments.\n* **Figure 2:** Has 5 segments.\n* **Figure 3:** Has 7 segments.\nNotice that each figure adds 2 segments to the previous figure.\n* **Finding the pattern:**  The number of segments is an arithmetic sequence: 3, 5, 7...  The common difference is 2.\n* **General Formula:** The general formula for an arithmetic sequence is: \n   *  a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d \n   *  where a_n is the nth term, a_1 is the first term, n is the number of the term, and d is the common difference.\n* **Applying the formula:** We want to find the number of segments in Figure 25, so:\n   * a_1 = 3 (the first figure has 3 segments)\n   * n = 25 (we want to find the 25th figure)\n   * d = 2 (the common difference is 2)\n   * a_25 = 3 + (25 - 1) * 2 = 3 + 48 = 51\n**Therefore, Figure 25 of the sequence must be made with 51 congruent segments.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n* **Analyze the pattern:**  Notice that each figure adds one triangle to the previous figure. \n* **Find the relationship between segments and triangles:** \n    * Figure 1 has 3 segments and 1 triangle.\n    * Figure 2 has 5 segments and 2 triangles.\n    * Figure 3 has 7 segments and 3 triangles.\n* **Identify the pattern:**  The number of segments is always two more than twice the number of triangles.\n* **Apply the pattern to Figure 25:** Figure 25 has 25 triangles.  So, it would have (2 * 25) + 2 = 52 segments.\n**Therefore, you would need 52 congruent segments to make Figure 25 of the sequence.** \n",
