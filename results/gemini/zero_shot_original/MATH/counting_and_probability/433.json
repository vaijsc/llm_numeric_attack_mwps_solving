        "Here's how to solve the problem step by step:\n**1. Understanding the Problem:**\n* We have 4 identical objects (IMO gold medals) and 4 identical objects (IPhO gold medals).\n* We want to arrange them in a row, and the order matters (different arrangements are distinct).\n**2. Using Combinations:**\n* **Choose the positions for the IMO medals:** We have 4 positions, and we need to choose 2 of them. This can be done in  \u2074C\u2082 ways (4 choose 2), which is 6.\n* **The IPhO medals automatically fill the remaining positions:** Once we place the IMO medals, the IPhO medals will automatically occupy the remaining two spots.\n**3. Calculating the Total Arrangements:**\nSince we have 6 ways to choose the positions for the IMO medals, and the IPhO medals automatically fill the rest, there are a total of **6** distinct arrangements possible. \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem:\n**1.  Understanding the Problem**\nWe have 4 gold medals: 2 identical IMO medals and 2 identical IPhO medals. We want to arrange them in a row. Since the medals are indistinguishable within their categories, we only care about the order of the types of medals, not individual medals.\n**2.  Possible Arrangements**\nLet's represent IMO medals with \"I\" and IPhO medals with \"P\". Here are the possible arrangements:\n* IIPP\n* IIPP\n* IPIP\n* IPPI\n* PII\n* PPII\n**3.  Counting the Arrangements**\nWe have 6 distinct arrangements. \n**Answer:** There are **6** distinct arrangements possible. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n* **Indistinguishable:**  The IMO gold medals are identical, and so are the IPhO gold medals.  This means swapping two IMO medals doesn't create a new arrangement.\n* **Distinct Arrangements:**  We're looking for different ways to order the medals in a row.\n**Solving the Problem:**\n1. **Think of Placeholders:** Imagine 4 empty spaces representing the spots in the row:  _ _ _ _\n2. **Choose the IMO Medals:** We need to decide where to place the two IMO medals.  There are 4 places, and we need to choose 2.  The number of ways to do this is:  4 choose 2 (written as \u2074C\u2082 or  (4!)/(2!2!)) = 6.\n3. **The IPhO Medals:** Once we've placed the IMO medals, the IPhO medals automatically fill the remaining spots. There's only one way to arrange the IPhO medals since they are indistinguishable.\n**Answer:** There are **6** distinct arrangements possible. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Understand the Problem**\nWe have four gold medals: two IMO and two IPhO. We want to arrange them in a row, but the medals of the same type are indistinguishable. This means we can't tell the IMO medals apart and the IPhO medals apart.\n**2.  Think in terms of Spaces**\nImagine four empty spaces representing the positions in the row:\n_ _ _ _\n**3.  Place the IMO Medals**\n* We need to choose two spaces out of four for the IMO medals.  This is a combination problem, and we can calculate it as:  \u2074C\u2082 = 4! / (2! * 2!) = 6.\n**4.  The IPhO Medals are Automatically Placed**\nSince the IMO medals are already placed, the IPhO medals automatically fill the remaining two spaces. \n**5.  The Answer**\nThere are **6** distinct arrangements possible. \n",

Finding the Total Number of Places**\n* There are 6 total positions in the row.\n**3.  Applying the Formula**\n*  The number of ways to arrange *n* objects, where *k* of them are identical, is given by: n! / (k! * (n-k)!)\n**4.  Calculating the Arrangements**\n*  We have 4 IMO gold medals and 2 IPhO gold medals, so our calculation becomes: 6! / (4! * 2!) \n*  This simplifies to (6 * 5 * 4!)/(4! * 2) = 15\n**Therefore, there are 15 distinct arrangements possible.** \n"
