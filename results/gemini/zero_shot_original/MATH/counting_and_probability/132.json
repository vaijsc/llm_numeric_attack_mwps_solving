        "Here's how to break down the problem step-by-step:\n* **The teacher needs to correctly guess 4 names.**  Since there are 20 students, she has 20 choices for the first paper. \n* **For the second paper, there are only 19 students left.** So, she has 19 choices.\n* **For the third paper, she has 18 choices left.**\n* **Finally, for the last paper, she has 17 choices left.**\nTo find the total number of ways the teacher can guess, we multiply the number of choices at each step: 20 * 19 * 18 * 17.\nHowever, there's only **one** correct way to match all four papers.\nTherefore, the probability of the teacher guessing correctly is:\n1 / (20 * 19 * 18 * 17) = **1/116,280** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n* **Step 1:  Figure out how many papers are missing names.** \n   Since 20 students are in the class and 4 didn't put their names on their papers, 20 - 4 = 16 papers have names.\n* **Step 2: Calculate the probability of the teacher guessing the first unnamed paper correctly.**\n   The teacher has 20 papers to choose from, and only 1 is the correct one. So, the probability is 1/20.\n* **Step 3: Calculate the probability of guessing the second unnamed paper correctly.**\n   Now there are only 19 papers left, and only one is the correct one. The probability is 1/19.\n* **Step 4: Continue this pattern for the remaining unnamed papers.**\n   The probability for the third paper is 1/18, and for the fourth paper, it's 1/17.\n* **Step 5: Multiply the probabilities together.**\n   To get the probability of guessing all four correctly, we multiply the probabilities from each step: (1/20) * (1/19) * (1/18) * (1/17) = **1/116280** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this step-by-step:\n* **Step 1:  How many papers are unassigned?** \n   Since 4 students didn't put their names on their papers, there are 4 unassigned papers.\n* **Step 2: How many choices does the teacher have for the first unassigned paper?**\n   She has 20 choices, since there are 20 students in total.\n* **Step 3: How many choices does the teacher have for the second unassigned paper?**\n   After assigning one paper, she only has 19 students left, so 19 choices.\n* **Step 4: How many choices does the teacher have for the third unassigned paper?**\n   Now she has 18 choices.\n* **Step 5: How many choices does the teacher have for the fourth unassigned paper?**\n   Finally, she has 17 choices.\n* **Step 6:  What is the total number of ways to assign the 4 papers?**\n   The teacher has 20 * 19 * 18 * 17 ways to assign the 4 papers.\n* **Step 7: What is the probability of assigning the 4 papers correctly?** \n   There's only one way to assign the 4 papers correctly.  \n* **Step 8:  Calculate the probability** \n   The probability is the number of successful outcomes (1) divided by the total number of possible outcomes (20 * 19 * 18 * 17):\n   1 / (20 * 19 * 18 * 17) = **1/116280** \n",
