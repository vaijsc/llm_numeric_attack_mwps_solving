    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "We have enough information to solve for the size of each team. There are $\\dfrac{60}{2}=30$ members of the basketball team, $\\dfrac{4}{3}(30)=40$ members of the math team, and $\\dfrac{2}{3}(30)=20$ members of the soccer team. Adding these up gives us 90, so clearly we're overcounting since there are only 60 students. The number of times that each student is counted in this total is equal to the number of teams that student plays on. This means that all 60 students will be counted at least once, all students who play exactly two sports will be counted one extra time, and all students who play three sports will be counted two extra times. Letting $x$ be the number of students who play two sports and $y$ be the number who play all three gives us $60+x+2y=90$. However, we know that $y=8$, so we can substitute that in and get $x=\\boxed{14}$.",

        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the number of students on the basketball team:**\n* Half the students play basketball, so there are 60 / 2 = 30 students on the basketball team.\n**2. Determine the proportions of the teams:**\n* The ratio of Mathletics : Basketball : Soccer is 4:3:2.  This means we can think of the teams as divided into 4 + 3 + 2 = 9 parts.\n**3. Calculate the size of each team:**\n* Since there are 30 students on the basketball team, and the basketball team represents 3 parts of the ratio, each part represents 30 / 3 = 10 students.\n* Mathletics team: 4 parts * 10 students/part = 40 students\n* Soccer team: 2 parts * 10 students/part = 20 students\n**4. Visualize with a Venn Diagram:**\n* Draw a Venn Diagram with three overlapping circles representing Basketball, Mathletics, and Soccer.\n* We know 8 students play all three sports, so write \"8\" in the center of the overlap.\n**5. Find the number of students playing Basketball and Mathletics only:**\n*  We know 40 students play Mathletics, and 8 play all three. This means 40 - 8 = 32 students play Mathletics only. \n* We also know 30 students play Basketball. Since 8 play all three, 30 - 8 = 22 students play Basketball only.\n* We can fill in the Venn Diagram with these numbers.\n**6. Find the number of students playing Basketball and Soccer only:**\n* We know 20 students play Soccer.  To find those playing Basketball and Soccer only, we need to subtract the number playing all three and those playing Soccer and Mathletics only.  We'll get to that in the next step.\n**7. Find the number of students playing Mathletics and Soccer only:**\n* We know 32 students play Mathletics only and 8 play all three.  To find those playing Soccer and Mathletics only, subtract from the total Mathletics team: 40 - 32 - 8 = 0 students. \n* This means there are NO students playing Soccer and Mathletics only.  We can fill that part of the Venn Diagram with \"0\".\n**8.  Find the number of students playing Basketball and Soccer only:**\n*  We know 20 students play Soccer.  We've accounted for 8 (all three) and 0 (Soccer and Mathletics only). This means 20 - 8 - 0 = 12 students play Basketball and Soccer only. \n**9.  Add up the students playing exactly two sports:**\n* The number of students playing exactly two sports is 32 + 12 + 0 = **44**\n**Therefore, 44 students at the school play on exactly two teams.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the number of students who play basketball:**\n* Half the students play basketball, so there are 60 / 2 = 30 students on the basketball team.\n**2. Find the ratio of students on each team:**\n* The ratio of Mathletics:Basketball:Soccer is 4:3:2. Since the basketball team has 30 students, we can find the number of students on the other teams:\n    * Mathletics: (4/3) * 30 = 40 students\n    * Soccer: (2/3) * 30 = 20 students\n**3. Visualize the problem:**\n* Draw a Venn diagram with three overlapping circles representing Basketball, Soccer, and Mathletics.  \n* Label the region where all three circles overlap as \"8\" (students playing all three).\n**4.  Use the ratios to find the number of students playing exactly two sports:**\n* **Basketball and Mathletics:**  Since the ratio of Mathletics to Basketball is 4:3, and we know 8 students play all three, there are 40 - 8 = 32 students on the Mathletics team who don't play soccer.  Of those, 32 * (3/4) = 24 students play basketball. \n* **Basketball and Soccer:**  Since the ratio of Basketball to Soccer is 3:2, and we know 8 students play all three, there are 20 - 8 = 12 students on the Soccer team who don't play Mathletics. Of those, 12 * (3/2) = 18 students play basketball.\n* **Mathletics and Soccer:**  Since the ratio of Mathletics to Soccer is 4:2, and we know 8 students play all three, there are 40 - 8 = 32 students on the Mathletics team who don't play basketball. Of those, 32 * (2/4) = 16 students play soccer.\n**5. Calculate the total number of students playing exactly two sports:**\n* Add the number of students playing exactly two sports from each pair of teams: 24 + 18 + 16 = **58**\n**Therefore, 58 students at the school play on exactly two teams.** \n",

Find the number of students who play basketball:**\n* Half the students play basketball, so there are 60 students / 2 = 30 students on the basketball team.\n**2. Determine the size of each team using the ratio:**\n* The ratio of Math:Basketball:Soccer is 4:3:2.\n* Since 30 students play basketball, we can find the size of each team by dividing the ratio terms by the basketball team's ratio term (3) and multiplying by the number of basketball players:\n    * Math team: (4/3) * 30 = 40 students\n    * Soccer team: (2/3) * 30 = 20 students\n**3. Visualize the problem with a Venn diagram:**\n* Draw three overlapping circles representing the basketball, soccer, and math teams.\n* The overlapping sections represent students who play on multiple teams.\n* The center of the diagram represents the 8 students who play all three sports.\n**4. Find the number of students who play basketball and math but not soccer:**\n* We know 40 students play math and 30 play basketball.\n* 8 students play all three sports.\n* To find the number who play basketball and math only, subtract the students who play all three from the total math and basketball players: 40 + 30 - 8 = 62.\n* However, we only have 60 students total, so we know there must be some overlap between basketball, math, and soccer.  This means 62 - 60 = 2 students must be counted twice. These 2 students are the ones who play basketball and math but not soccer.\n**5. Find the number of students who play soccer and math but not basketball:**\n* Use the same logic as above.  We know 40 students play math and 20 play soccer.\n* 8 students play all three sports.\n* To find the number who play soccer and math only, subtract the students who play all three from the total soccer and math players: 40 + 20 - 8 = 52.\n* However, we only have 60 students total, so we know there must be some overlap between basketball, math, and soccer.  This means 52 - 60 = -8.  This is impossible, so it means there are 0 students who play soccer and math but not basketball.\n**6. Find the number of students who play soccer and basketball but not math:**\n* We know 30 students play basketball and 20 play soccer.\n* 8 students play all three sports.\n* To find the number who play soccer and basketball only, subtract the students who play all three from the total soccer and basketball players: 30 + 20 - 8 = 42.\n* Since we have 60 students total, this number is valid.\n**7. Calculate the total number of students who play on exactly two teams:**\n* Add up the students who play on each pair of teams: 2 + 0 + 42 = **44 students**\n**Therefore, 44 students at the school play on exactly two teams.** \n",

Find the number of students who play only basketball:**\n* Since 30 students play basketball, and 8 play all three, then 30 - 8 = 22 students play only basketball.\n**5. Find the number of students who play only math:**\n* Since 40 students play math, and 8 play all three, then 40 - 8 = 32 students play only math.\n**6. Find the number of students who play only soccer:**\n* Since 20 students play soccer, and 8 play all three, then 20 - 8 = 12 students play only soccer.\n**7. Find the number of students who play basketball and math only:**\n* Let 'x' be the number of students who play basketball and math only. \n*  We know 8 students play all three, 22 play only basketball, and 32 play only math.  These groups, plus the 'x' students, must add up to the total 30 students on the basketball team: 8 + 22 + x = 30\n* Solving for x, we get x = 0. This means there are **no** students who play basketball and math only.\n**8. Find the number of students who play basketball and soccer only:**\n* Let 'y' be the number of students who play basketball and soccer only.\n*  We know 8 students play all three, 22 play only basketball, and 12 play only soccer.  These groups, plus the 'y' students, must add up to the total 30 students on the basketball team: 8 + 22 + y = 30\n* Solving for y, we get y = 0.

Find the number of students who play math and soccer only:**\n* Let 'z' be the number of students who play math and soccer only.\n*  We know 8 students play all three, 32 play only math, and 12 play only soccer.  These groups, plus the 'z' students, must add up to the total 40 students on the math team: 8 + 32 + z = 40\n* Solving for z, we get z = 0. This means there are **no** students who play math and soccer only.\n**10. Total students playing exactly two sports:**\n* Since there are no students who play exactly two sports (basketball and math, basketball and soccer, or math and soccer), the total number of students playing exactly two sports is **0**. \n",

Determine the ratio representing the total number of students on the three teams:**\n* The ratio of the sizes of the teams is 4:3:2. This means the total ratio representing all the students is 4 + 3 + 2 = 9.\n**3. Calculate the number of students represented by one unit of the ratio:**\n* Since 30 students are on the basketball team, and the basketball team's ratio is 3, one unit of the ratio represents 30 / 3 = 10 students.\n**4. Find the size of each team:**\n* Math team: 4 units * 10 students/unit = 40 students\n* Basketball team: 3 units * 10 students/unit = 30 students\n* Soccer team: 2 units * 10 students/unit = 20 students\n**5.
