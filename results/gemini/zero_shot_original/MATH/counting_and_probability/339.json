    "solution": "First, just consider the apples. Imagine putting three dividers among the apples, so that Maria's first friend gets the apples to the left of the first divider, Maria's second friend gets the apples between the first and second dividers, Maria's third friend gets the apples between the second and third dividers, and Maria's last friend gets the apples after the third divider. With three dividers and three apples, there are $\\binom{6}{3}=20$ ways to arrange the dividers. Now, consider the oranges. Since Maria won't give Jacky any oranges, Maria has to distribute the oranges among her other three friends. With three oranges and two dividers, there are $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ ways for Maria to distribute the oranges. The total number of ways for Maria to distribute the fruit is $20\\cdot 10=\\boxed{200}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Focus on the Apples**\n* Maria has 3 apples to distribute among 4 friends (excluding Jacky, who won't get any). \n* This is a classic \"balls and urns\" problem. We can think of the apples as balls and the friends as urns.\n* We need to find the number of ways to put 3 identical balls into 3 distinct urns.\n**2. Using Stars and Bars**\n* Imagine the apples as stars: ***\n* We need two bars to separate the apples among the three friends. For example:\n    * **|***  means the first friend gets 3 apples, the second gets 0, and the third gets 0.\n    * *|**  means the first friend gets 1 apple, the second gets 0, and the third gets 2.\n* We have 5 total positions (3 stars and 2 bars). We need to choose 2 of these positions to be bars.\n**3. Combinations**\n* The number of ways to choose 2 positions out of 5 is given by the combination formula: \u2075C\u2082 = 5! / (2! * 3!) = 10\n**4. Distributing Oranges**\n* Since Jacky can't get oranges, we only need to distribute the 3 oranges among the remaining 3 friends.\n* Again, this is a \"balls and urns\" problem.\n* We have 3 oranges (balls) and 2 bars to separate them into 3 urns.\n* There are 5 total positions, and we need to choose 2 for the bars.\n**5. Calculating Combinations**\n* The number of ways to distribute oranges is \u2075C\u2082 = 5! / (2! * 3!) = 10\n**6. Total Ways**\n* For each way to distribute the apples, there are 10 ways to distribute the oranges.\n* Therefore, the total number of ways to distribute the fruits is 10 * 10 = **100**\n**Answer:** There are 100 ways for Maria to distribute the fruits among her friends. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step by step:\n**1. Distributing the Apples:**\n* Maria has 3 apples to distribute among 4 friends. \n* Think of the apples as identical balls and the friends as distinct boxes.\n* This is a classic \"balls and urns\" problem.  The number of ways to distribute *n* identical balls into *k* distinct boxes is (n+k-1) choose (k-1).\n* In our case, we have 3 apples (balls) and 4 friends (boxes): (3+4-1) choose (4-1) = 6 choose 3 = 20 ways to distribute the apples.\n**2. Distributing the Oranges:**\n* Maria has 3 oranges to distribute among 3 friends (since Jacky doesn't get any).\n* Again, using the \"balls and urns\" approach: (3+3-1) choose (3-1) = 5 choose 2 = 10 ways to distribute the oranges.\n**3. Combining the Distributions:**\n* Since the apple distribution and orange distribution are independent, we multiply the number of possibilities for each to find the total number of ways to distribute the fruit: 20 ways (apples) * 10 ways (oranges) = **200 ways**.\n**Therefore, there are 200 ways for Maria to distribute the fruits among her friends with the given restrictions.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Apples:**\n* Maria has 3 apples to distribute among 4 friends (excluding Jacky, who doesn't get any oranges).\n* Think of each apple as a \"slot\" to be filled.\n* Each slot can be filled with one of the 4 friends.\n* So, there are 4 choices for the first apple, 4 choices for the second apple, and 4 choices for the third apple.\n* This gives us a total of 4 * 4 * 4 = 64 ways to distribute the apples.\n**2. Oranges:**\n* Maria has 3 oranges to distribute among 3 friends (excluding Jacky).\n* Using the same logic as with the apples, we have 3 choices for the first orange, 3 choices for the second orange, and 3 choices for the third orange.\n* This gives us a total of 3 * 3 * 3 = 27 ways to distribute the oranges.\n**3. Total Ways:**\n* To get the total number of ways to distribute both the apples and oranges, we multiply the number of ways to distribute each type of fruit.\n* Total ways = 64 ways (apples) * 27 ways (oranges) = **1728 ways**\n**Therefore, there are 1728 ways for Maria to distribute the fruit among her friends with the given restrictions.** \n",

We need to find the number of ways to put 3 balls into 4 boxes.\n* This is a classic \"balls and urns\" problem.  We can use combinations to solve it.  We need to choose 3 \"balls\" from a set of 3 \"balls\" plus 3 \"dividers\" (to separate the boxes). This gives us 6 objects, and we need to choose 3 of them: \n   *  \u2076C\u2083 = (6!)/(3!3!) = 20\n**2. Distributing the Oranges**\n* Since Jacky can't get oranges, Maria has 3 oranges to distribute among 3 friends.\n* Again, we use the balls and urns concept.  We need to choose 3 \"balls\" from a set of 3 \"balls\" plus 2 \"dividers\":\n   * \u2075C\u2083 = (5!)/(3!2!) = 10\n**3. Combining the Possibilities**\n* To get the total number of ways to distribute the fruits, we multiply the number of ways to distribute apples by the number of ways to distribute oranges:\n   * 20 * 10 = **200**\n**Therefore, there are 200 ways for Maria to distribute the fruit among her friends under these conditions.** \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem step by step:\n**1. Apples:**\n* Maria has 3 apples to distribute among 4 friends (excluding Jacky, who gets no oranges).\n* We can think of this as placing 3 identical apples into 3 distinct containers (representing the friends). \n* This is a classic \"balls and urns\" problem.  The formula for this is (n + r - 1) choose (r - 1), where 'n' is the number of apples and 'r' is the number of friends.\n* So, the number of ways to distribute the apples is (3 + 3 - 1) choose (3 - 1) = 5 choose 2 = 10.\n**2.
