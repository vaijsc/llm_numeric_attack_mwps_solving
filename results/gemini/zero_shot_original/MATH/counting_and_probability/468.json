    "solution": "There are 4 ways to select the female lead and 4 ways to select the male lead. Afterwards, there are 6 members who can play the first inanimate object, 5 who can play the second, and 4 for the last.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $4\\times4\\times6\\times5\\times4 = \\boxed{1920\\text{ ways.}}$",

        "Here's how to break down the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Choosing the Female Lead**\n* There are 4 females to choose from for the female lead. \n**2. Choosing the Male Lead**\n* There are 4 males to choose from for the male lead.\n**3. Choosing the First Object**\n* Any of the 8 members can play the first object.\n**4. Choosing the Second Object**\n* Now there are only 7 members left who can play the second object.\n**5. Choosing the Third Object**\n* There are 6 members remaining who can play the third object.\n**Putting it All Together**\nTo find the total number of ways to assign roles, we multiply the number of choices at each step:\n4 * 4 * 8 * 7 * 6 = **6,720**\n**Therefore, there are 6,720 different ways to assign the roles in the play.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step by step:\n**1. Choosing the Female Lead:**\n* There are 4 options for the female lead.\n**2. Choosing the Male Lead:**\n* There are 4 options for the male lead (since there are 8 members total and one female has already been assigned).\n**3. Choosing the First Object:**\n* There are 8 options for the first object (since it can be played by either gender).\n**4. Choosing the Second Object:**\n* There are 7 options for the second object (since one person has already been assigned).\n**5. Choosing the Third Object:**\n* There are 6 options for the third object.\n**6. Calculating the Total Possibilities:**\n* To find the total number of ways to assign the roles, we multiply the number of options for each step:  4 * 4 * 8 * 7 * 6 = **4480**\n**Therefore, there are 4480 ways to assign the roles in the play.** \n",

Choosing the Male Lead:**\n* There are 4 options for the male lead (since 8 total members - 4 females = 4 males).\n**3. Choosing the First Object Role:**\n* There are 8 options for the first object role (anyone can play it).\n**4. Choosing the Second Object Role:**\n* There are 7 options left for the second object role.\n**5. Choosing the Third Object Role:**\n* There are 6 options left for the third object role.\n**6.

Choosing the First Object**\n* Any of the 8 members can play this role, so there are 8 ways to choose.\n**4. Choosing the Second Object**\n* After one person is chosen for the first object, there are 7 people left, so there are 7 ways to choose the second object.\n**5. Choosing the Third Object**\n* There are 6 people left, so there are 6 ways to choose the third object.\n**Putting it Together**\nTo find the total number of ways to assign the roles, we multiply the number of possibilities at each step:\n4 ways (female lead) * 4 ways (male lead) * 8 ways (object 1) * 7 ways (object 2) * 6 ways (object 3) = **6720 ways**\n**Therefore, there are 6720 ways to assign the roles in the play.** \n",
