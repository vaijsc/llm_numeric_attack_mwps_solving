        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**Understanding Pascal's Triangle**\n* **Binomial Coefficients:** Each entry in Pascal's triangle represents a binomial coefficient, denoted as  $\\binom{n}{k}$ (read as \"n choose k\"). This represents the number of ways to choose *k* items from a set of *n* items.\n* **Symmetry:** Pascal's triangle is symmetric. The entries on either side of the center are equal.\n* **Combinatorial Formula:**  $\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$\n**The Key Insight**\nThe key is to understand the relationship between even and odd entries in Pascal's triangle.  An entry in Pascal's triangle will be even if and only if the binomial coefficient representing it has a factor of 2 in its denominator. \n**Analyzing the Rows**\nLet's examine the rows to find the pattern:\n* **Row 0:** Only one entry (1), which is odd.\n* **Row 1:** Only two entries (1, 1), both odd.\n* **Row 2:** Three entries (1, 2, 1). The middle entry (2) is even. \n* **Row 3:** Four entries (1, 3, 3, 1). All entries except the 1's are odd.\n* **Row 4:** Five entries (1, 4, 6, 4, 1). The middle entry (6) and the two entries on either side of it (4, 4) are even.\n* **Row 5:** Six entries (1, 5, 10, 10, 5, 1). All entries except the 1's are odd.\n**The Pattern**\nNotice that a row will have only even entries (except for the 1's) if:\n1. **The row number (n) is a power of 2:** This is because when n is a power of 2, all the factorials in the denominator of the binomial coefficient formula will have at least one factor of 2, making the entire coefficient even.\n**Counting the Rows**\n* The first few powers of 2 are: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64. \n* Within the first 100 rows, there are 6 powers of 2.\n**Therefore, there are **6** rows in the first 100 rows that contain at least one even entry and no odd entries other than 1.** \n",
        "Let\u2019s think step by step.\n**Understanding Pascal's Triangle:**\n* **Formation:** Each number in Pascal's Triangle is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. \n* **Binomial Theorem:** The numbers in each row represent the coefficients in the expansion of $(x+y)^n$, where *n* is the row number. \n**Even and Odd Entries:**\n* **Row 0:**  Contains only 1 (odd).\n* **Row 1:** Contains only 1's (odd).\n* **Row 2:** Contains 1, 2, 1 (one even).\n* **Row 3:** Contains 1, 3, 3, 1 (all odd).\nNotice a pattern:\n* **Even Rows (n is even):**  The middle entries will always be even (since they are the sum of two equal numbers). The entries at the ends are always 1 (odd).\n* **Odd Rows (n is odd):** All entries will be odd (since they are the sum of two odd numbers).\n**Finding the Rows with the Desired Property:**\n* **Even Rows are the only candidates:** We only need to look at the even rows because odd rows will always have more than one odd number.\n* **Checking for Even Entries:** We need to make sure that *all* the entries in the even row, except for the 1's at the ends, are even.\n**The Key Observation:**\nThink about the Binomial Theorem.  An entry in row *n* is given by  $\\binom{n}{k}$, where *k* is the position of the entry in the row (starting with 0).\n*  **$\\binom{n}{k}$ is even if and only if n is even and k is not 0 or n.**  This is because the formula for $\\binom{n}{k}$ involves a factorial in the denominator. \n**Conclusion:**\n* The only rows that meet the criteria are the even rows with the exception of row 0. \n*  There are **49** even rows between rows 2 and 100 (inclusive).\n**Therefore, there are 49 rows in the first 100 rows that contain at least one even entry and no odd entries other than 1.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding Pascal's Triangle**\n* **Binomial Coefficients:** Each entry in Pascal's Triangle represents a binomial coefficient, denoted as $\\binom{n}{k}$, where *n* is the row number (starting from 0) and *k* is the position within the row (also starting from 0).  \n* **Formula:**  $\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$\n**The Pattern**\nThe key to solving this problem lies in understanding how even and odd numbers appear in Pascal's Triangle:\n* **Row 0 and Row 1:**  All entries are 1 (odd).\n* **Row 2 onwards:** An entry is even if and only if both the row number *n* and the position within the row *k* are greater than or equal to 2.\n**Why is this pattern true?**\nConsider the formula for binomial coefficients.  If *n* or *k* is less than 2, then either *n*! or *k*! will have a factor of 2 in the denominator, making the whole fraction even.  If both *n* and *k* are greater than or equal to 2, then the denominator has two factors of 2 (one from *n*! and one from *k*!), but the numerator does not, making the whole fraction even.\n**Finding the Rows**\nSince we want rows with only even entries (except the 1s at the edges), we need rows where *n* is greater than or equal to 4 (so that the middle entries are even). However, we also need to make sure there are no odd entries in the middle. \nNotice that the \"middle\" of a row grows wider as the row number increases. For example, in row 4, only the two middle entries are even. In row 6, there are three even entries in the middle.  \n**The Solution**\nTherefore, the rows that meet the condition are:\n* **Row 4:**  (1, 4, 6, 4, 1)\n* **Row 8:** (1, 8, 28, 56, 70, 56, 28, 8, 1)\n* **Row 12:** (1, 12, 66, 220, 495, 792, 924, 792, 495, 220, 66, 12, 1)\n* ... and so on.\nThis pattern continues with rows 16, 20, 24, etc.  Notice that these are rows where the row number is a multiple of 4.\n**Counting the Rows**\nIn the first 100 rows, there are 100 / 4 = 25 rows that meet the condition.\n**Answer:** There are **25** rows in the first 100 rows of Pascal's Triangle that contain at least one even entry and no odd entries other than 1. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding Pascal's Triangle**\n* **Rows and Entries:** Each row of Pascal's triangle starts and ends with 1. Every other entry is the sum of the two entries directly above it.\n* **Binomial Coefficients:** The entries in Pascal's triangle represent binomial coefficients. The $k$th entry in the $n$th row is given by  $\\binom{n}{k}$, which represents the number of ways to choose $k$ items from a set of $n$ items.\n**Analyzing the Pattern**\nLet's examine the pattern of even and odd entries:\n* **Row 0:** All entries are odd (1).\n* **Row 1:** All entries are odd (1, 1).\n* **Row 2:**  One entry is even (1, 2, 1).\n* **Row 3:**  All entries are odd (1, 3, 3, 1).\n* **Row 4:** One entry is even (1, 4, 6, 4, 1).\nNotice that a row will contain only even entries (except for the 1s) if and only if the row number is a power of 2. This is because:\n*  $\\binom{n}{k}$ is even unless $n$ is a power of 2.\n* If $n$ is a power of 2, then the only way to get an odd entry is by choosing 0 or $n$ items from a set of $n$ items (which are represented by the 1s at the ends of the row).\n**Finding the Solution**\nThe first 100 rows that satisfy the condition (at least one even entry, no other odd entries) correspond to the powers of 2 from 2\u2070 to 2\u2076 (since 2\u2077 is 128):\n* 2\u2070 = 1\n* 2\u00b9 = 2\n* 2\u00b2 = 4\n* 2\u00b3 = 8\n* 2\u2074 = 16\n* 2\u2075 = 32\n* 2\u2076 = 64\nTherefore, there are **7** rows in the first 100 rows of Pascal's triangle that have the desired property. \n",
        "Let's break down the problem and find the solution.\n**Understanding Pascal's Triangle**\n* **Combinations:** Each entry in Pascal's Triangle represents a binomial coefficient, denoted as  $\\binom{n}{k}$, which calculates the number of ways to choose *k* items from a set of *n* items.

This is because the only way to get odd entries is by having relatively prime *n* and *k* values, and in these rows, *n* is a power of 2, so it shares a common factor with any non-zero *k*.\n3. **Generalization:**  Notice that any row where *n* is a power of 2 (n = 2, 4, 8, 16, ...) will have the desired property. This is because all the entries, except for the 1s, will be formed by summing numbers that have a common factor of 2.\n**Finding the Solution**\n* We need to find the number of powers of 2 between 2 and 100. \n* The largest power of 2 less than 100 is 64 (2^6).\n* There are 6 powers of 2 between 2 and 100 (2^1, 2^2, ..., 2^6).\n**Answer:** There are **6** rows in the first 100 rows of Pascal's Triangle that contain at least one even entry and no odd entries other than 1. \n"
