    "solution": "The product of two integers is even unless both of the integers are odd.  Therefore, the only pair of integers from the set $\\{1,2,3,4\\}$ whose product is odd is $\\{1,3\\}$.  Since there are $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ pairs, the probability of drawing $\\{1,3\\}$ is $\\frac{1}{6}$.  So the probability of drawing two numbers whose product is even is $1-\\dfrac{1}{6}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{6}}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1.  Possible Outcomes:**\n* There are 4 choices for the first number and 3 choices for the second number (since we can't choose the same number twice).  \n* This gives us a total of 4 * 3 = 12 possible pairs of numbers.\n**2.  Favorable Outcomes:**\n* The product will be even if at least one of the numbers is even. \n* Let's count the pairs that have at least one even number:\n    * (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)\n* There are 10 pairs with at least one even number.\n**3.  Probability:**\n* The probability of getting an even product is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes.\n* Probability = 10/12 = **5/6** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n* **Possible Outcomes:** We need to figure out how many ways we can choose two numbers from the set {1, 2, 3, 4}.  Since order doesn't matter (2 x 3 is the same as 3 x 2), we're dealing with combinations. There are 6 possible combinations:\n   * (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4)\n* **Favorable Outcomes:**  We want the product of the two numbers to be even. This happens when at least one of the numbers is even. Let's list the combinations that satisfy this:\n   * (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4)\n* **Probability:** The probability of an event is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.  \n   * Probability (even product) = 5 / 6 \n**Therefore, the probability that the product of two randomly selected numbers from the set {1, 2, 3, 4} is even is 5/6.** \n",
