We want to find the region where the dart is closer to point *B* (at 4) than to either *A* (at 0) or *C* (at 6).\n**2.  Find the Midpoint**\n* The midpoint between *A* (0) and *B* (4) is 2.\n* The midpoint between *B* (4) and *C* (6) is 5.\n**3. Identify the Favorable Region**\n* If the dart lands between 2 and 5, it will be closer to *B* than *A* or *C*.\n**4. Calculate the Probability**\n* The total length of the number line segment from *A* to *C* is 6 units.\n* The length of the favorable region (between 2 and 5) is 3 units.\nTherefore, the probability of the dart landing closer to *B* is the ratio of the favorable region to the total length:\n* Probability = (Favorable Length) / (Total Length) = 3/6 = **1/2** \n**Answer:** The probability that the dart lands closer to *B* than to *A* or *C* is **1/2**. \n",

Identify the \"Closer to B\" Region**\n*  If the dart lands to the left of the midpoint (3), it's closer to A.\n*  If the dart lands to the right of the midpoint (3), it's closer to C.\n*  If the dart lands *exactly* at the midpoint, it's the same distance from A and C.\nTherefore, the dart is closer to B only if it lands between points B (4) and the midpoint (3).\n**4. Calculate the Probability**\n* The total distance between A and C is 6 units.\n* The distance between B and the midpoint is 1 unit (4 - 3).\n* The probability of the dart landing closer to B is the ratio of the favorable distance to the total distance:  1/6.\n**Answer:** The probability that the dart lands closer to B than A or C is **1/6**. \n",

Calculate the probabilities:**\n* **Probability of landing closer to B:** The distance between the midpoint (3) and B (4) is 1 unit.  The distance between A (0) and C (6) is 6 units.  So the probability of landing closer to B is 1/6.\n* **Probability of landing closer to A or C:**  The distance between the midpoint (3) and A (0) is 3 units, and the distance between the midpoint (3) and C (6) is 3 units. This makes a total of 6 units where the dart could land closer to A or C.  The probability of landing closer to A or C is 6/6 = 1.\n**4.
