    "solution": "There are $\\binom{52}{2}=\\frac{52\\cdot 51}{2}=26\\cdot 51$ ways to choose two cards from a 52-card deck. There are $\\binom{13}{2}=\\frac{13\\cdot 12}{2}$ ways to choose two cards which are both hearts, and the same number of ways to choose two cards which are both diamonds. Therefore, the probability of choosing two cards which are both hearts or both diamonds is $\\frac{13 \\cdot 12}{26 \\cdot 51}=\\boxed{\\frac{2}{17}}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Calculate the Probability of Getting Two Hearts**\n* **Probability of getting a heart on the first draw:** 13 hearts / 52 cards = 1/4\n* **Probability of getting another heart on the second draw (given you already drew a heart):** 12 hearts / 51 cards = 4/17 \n* **Probability of getting two hearts in a row:** (1/4) * (4/17) = 1/17\n**2. Calculate the Probability of Getting Two Diamonds**\n* This follows the same logic as getting two hearts.\n* **Probability of getting two diamonds in a row:** (1/4) * (4/17) = 1/17\n**3.  Add the Probabilities (Since the Events are Mutually Exclusive)**\n* The events \"getting two hearts\" and \"getting two diamonds\" can't happen at the same time, so they are mutually exclusive.\n*  **Total Probability:** (1/17) + (1/17) = 2/17\n**Therefore, the probability of drawing two cards that are either both hearts or both diamonds is 2/17.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Probability of the first card being a heart or diamond:**\n* There are 13 hearts and 13 diamonds in a deck of 52 cards.\n* So, there are 26 favorable outcomes (hearts or diamonds).\n* The probability of drawing a heart or diamond on the first draw is 26/52 = 1/2.\n**2. Probability of the second card matching the suit of the first:**\n* After drawing the first card, there are only 51 cards left.\n* Since we want the second card to match the suit of the first, there are only 12 cards left of that suit.\n* Therefore, the probability of drawing a matching card is 12/51.\n**3. Combined Probability:**\n* To get the probability of both events happening, we multiply the probabilities together:\n   (1/2) * (12/51) = 12/102 = 2/17\n**Therefore, the probability of drawing two cards that are either both hearts or both diamonds is 2/17.** \n",

Probability of the second card being a heart or diamond (given the first was a heart or diamond):**\n* After taking out one heart or diamond, there are only 51 cards left.\n* Since we want the second card to be the same suit as the first, there are only 12 cards left of that suit.\n* So, the probability of drawing a heart or diamond on the second draw (given the first was a heart or diamond) is 12/51.\n**3. Combining the probabilities:**\n* To get the probability of both events happening, we multiply the individual probabilities: (1/2) * (12/51) = 12/102 = **2/17**\n**Therefore, the probability of drawing two cards from a standard deck that are either both hearts or both diamonds is 2/17.** \n",
