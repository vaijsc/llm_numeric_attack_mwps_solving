    "solution": "We know that the number of subsets of any given set is equal to $2^n,$ where $n$ is the number of elements in the set. First, then, we need to find the number of composite divisors. The prime factorization of $72$ is $72=2^3 \\cdot 3^2,$ so there are $(3+1)(2+1)=12$ total divisors. (To see this, note that we can form a divisor of the form $2^a 3^b$ by freely choosing $a=0,1,2,3$ and $b=0,1,2$). Of these, $1$ is neither prime nor composite, and $2$ and $3$ are prime, for a total of $9$ composite divisors. Therefore there are $2^9=\\boxed{512}$ subsets of the divisors of $72$ with only composite divisors.",

        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the divisors of 72:**\nThe divisors of 72 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 72.\n**2. Identify the composite divisors:**\nA composite number is a number that has more than two factors (including 1 and itself).  From the list above, the composite divisors of 72 are: 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 72.\n**3. Determine the subsets containing only composite numbers:**\nWe need to find all the subsets of the set of composite divisors.  To make this easier, let's consider the number of elements in each subset:\n* **Empty set:**  {} \n* **Subsets with 1 element:** {4}, {6}, {8}, {9}, {12}, {18}, {24}, {36}, {72}\n* **Subsets with 2 elements:** {4, 6}, {4, 8}, {4, 9}, ..., {36, 72} (and so on)\n* **Subsets with 3 elements:** {4, 6, 8}, {4, 6, 9}, ..., {36, 72} (and so on)\n* ... and so on, up to the subset with all 9 composite divisors.\n**4. Count the total number of subsets:**\nTo count the total number of subsets, we can think about each composite divisor as having two options: either it's in the subset or it's not. Since we have 9 composite divisors, there are 2 x 2 x 2 x ... x 2 (9 times) = 2^9 = 512 possible subsets.\n**Therefore, there are 512 subsets of the set of divisors of 72 that contain only composite numbers.** \n",

Each of these divisors can either be in a subset or not.  This gives us 2 choices for each divisor.  Since we have 9 divisors, the total number of subsets is $2^9 = \\boxed{512}$.\n**Important Note:** We include the empty set as a subset containing only composite numbers, since it contains zero composite numbers. \n",

Identify the composite divisors:**\nA composite number is a positive integer that has at least one divisor other than 1 and itself.  The composite divisors of 72 are: 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 72.\n**3. Count the subsets:**\nWe need to count the subsets of the set of composite divisors.  Think about building these subsets:\n* **Empty Set:**  The empty set is a subset of every set, including this one.\n* **One Element Subsets:** We have 9 composite divisors, so there are 9 one-element subsets.\n* **Two Element Subsets:**  We need to choose 2 composite divisors out of 9.  This is a combination problem, and there are  \u2079C\u2082 = 36 ways to do this.\n* **Three Element Subsets:**  Similarly, there are \u2079C\u2083 = 84 ways to choose 3 composite divisors.\n* ... and so on.\n**4. Apply the Binomial Theorem:**\nNotice that the number of subsets we're counting follows the pattern of the binomial theorem:\n(1 + x)\u2079 = \u00b9C\u2080 + \u00b9C\u2081x + \u00b9C\u2082x\u00b2 + \u00b9C\u2083x\u00b3 + ... + \u00b9C\u2089x\u2079\nIf we set x = 1, we get:\n2\u2079 = \u00b9C\u2080 + \u00b9C\u2081 + \u00b9C\u2082 + \u00b9C\u2083 + ... + \u00b9C\u2089\nThis tells us that the sum of the number of subsets of all sizes (including the empty set) is 2\u2079. \n**Therefore, there are a total of 2\u2079 = **512** subsets of the set of divisors of 72 that contain only composite numbers.** \n",
