    "problem": "Three couples go to the movie theater. They want to seat people together for maximum enjoyment, but instead they randomly file into a row with six seats.

    "solution": "There are $\\binom{6}{2} = 15$ ways to pick people to fill the first two seats, and 3 ways for those two people to be a couple, for a probability $3/15 = 1/5$ that the first two seats are a couple. If a couple is seated successfully, there are $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways to seat people in the next two seats, and 2 ways for those two people to be a couple (you could pick either of the two remaining couples), for a probability $2/6 = 1/3$ that those two seats are a couple. If the first two couples are seated successfully, the last two seats will be guaranteed to go to the last couple. So, the probability that everything goes right is $1/5 \\cdot 1/3 = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{15}}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Total Possible Arrangements**\n* There are 6 seats, and 6 people, so there are 6! (6 factorial) ways to arrange them.\n* 6! = 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720\n**2. Socially Optimal Arrangements**\n*  Let's consider one couple. There are 2 ways to arrange them (person A then person B, or person B then person A).\n*  Since we have three couples, there are 2 * 2 * 2 = 8 ways to arrange the couples in the row.\n*  Within each couple, we can swap their positions, so we have 2! = 2 ways to arrange the individuals within each couple.\n*  Therefore, the total number of socially optimal arrangements is 8 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 64.\n**3. Calculate the Probability**\n*  The probability of a socially optimal arrangement is the number of optimal arrangements divided by the total number of possible arrangements: \n    * Probability = 64 / 720 = 1/11.25 = **approximately 0.089 or 8.9%** \n**Therefore, the probability that the three couples will sit together in a socially optimal configuration is approximately 8.9%.** \n",
        "Here's how to break down the probability calculation step-by-step:\n**1. Total Possible Arrangements**\n* There are 6 seats, and 6 people. The first person has 6 choices, the second has 5 choices left, and so on.  \n* The total number of possible arrangements (without any restrictions) is 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720.  This is called 6 factorial (6!).\n**2. Favorable Arrangements**\n* **Consider one couple:** Let's say Couple A.  They have 2 seats they can occupy (think of it as one unit). There are 5 remaining places for this couple. \n* **Second Couple:** Once Couple A is seated, Couple B has 4 remaining places to sit.\n* **Third Couple:**  The final couple has only 2 remaining places.\n* **Within the couples:**  Each couple can swap positions within their two seats (2 arrangements).\n**3. Calculating the Probability**\n* **Favorable arrangements:** 5 * 4 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 320 \n    * The first 2 factors (5 * 4) represent the placement of the couples.\n    * The remaining factors (2 * 2 * 2 * 2) represent the possible arrangements within each couple.\n* **Probability:** (Favorable arrangements) / (Total possible arrangements) = 320 / 720 = **4/9**\n**Therefore, the probability that the three couples will sit in a socially optimal configuration is 4/9.** \n",
        "Here's how to break down the problem and find the probability:\n**1. Total Possible Arrangements**\n* There are 6 seats, and 6 people. So, the first person has 6 choices, the second has 5 choices left, and so on. \n* The total number of ways to arrange 6 people in 6 seats is 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 6! = 720.\n**2. Favorable Arrangements (Socially Optimal)**\n* **Focus on Couples:** Treat each couple as a unit. There are 3 couples, so we have 3 units to arrange. These 3 units can be arranged in 3! = 6 ways.\n* **Arrange within Couples:** Each couple can switch places within their unit (person 1 then person 2, or person 2 then person 1). This gives us 2 possibilities for each couple, and since there are 3 couples, we have 2 * 2 * 2 = 2\u00b3 = 8 ways.\n**3. Calculate the Probability**\n* **Favorable Arrangements:** 6 (arrangements of couples) * 8 (arrangements within couples) = 48\n* **Probability:** (Favorable Arrangements) / (Total Arrangements) = 48 / 720 = 1/15\n**Therefore, the probability that the three couples sit in a socially optimal configuration is 1/15.** \n",
