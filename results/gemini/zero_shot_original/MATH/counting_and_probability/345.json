    "solution": "We can compute this a few ways, but the numbers seem small enough that we can go ahead and just compute the probability of A being selected all three days, and the probability of A being selected exactly 2 of the three days. Team A is selected on any given day with probability $\\frac{2}{3}$, because there are ${3 \\choose 2} = 3$ possible pairs of teams, and 2 of them contain A. So, there is a $\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^3 = \\frac{8}{27}$ chance of being selected all three days. Of being selected exactly twice, there is a $\\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot {3 \\choose 2} = \\frac{4}{9}$ chance. Adding these two yields $\\frac{8}{27} + \\frac{4}{9} = \\frac{8+12}{27} = \\boxed{\\frac{20}{27}}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Calculate the probability of Team A being selected on a single day.**\n* There are three teams, and two are chosen. \n* Team A can be chosen in 2 ways (either as one of the two teams or the other). \n* There are a total of 3C2 = 3 ways to choose two teams out of three.\n* The probability of Team A being selected on a single day is 2/3.\n**2. Calculate the probability of Team A NOT being selected on a single day.**\n* Since the probability of Team A being selected is 2/3, the probability of it *not* being selected is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.\n**3.  Consider the possible scenarios for Team A being selected at least twice in three days.**\n* **Scenario 1: Team A is selected on all three days.**\n   * The probability of this happening is (2/3) * (2/3) * (2/3) = 8/27.\n* **Scenario 2: Team A is selected on two days and not selected on the third day.**\n   * There are three ways this can happen (AAB, ABA, BAA).\n   * The probability of each of these ways is (2/3) * (2/3) * (1/3) = 4/27.\n**4. Calculate the total probability.**\n* Add the probabilities of the two scenarios: 8/27 + (3 * 4/27) = 20/27\n**Therefore, the probability that Team A is selected on at least two of the next three days is 20/27.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Cases to Consider**\nTeam A can be selected on at least two of the next three days in the following ways:\n* **Case 1:**  Team A is selected on all three days.\n* **Case 2:** Team A is selected on two days, and another team is selected on the third day. \n**2. Calculate Probabilities**\n* **Case 1:** The probability that Team A is selected on any given day is 2/3 (since 2 teams are chosen out of 3).  The probability that Team A is selected on all three days is (2/3) * (2/3) * (2/3) = 8/27.\n* **Case 2:**  The probability that Team A is selected on two days and another team is selected on the third day is more complex.  Let's break it down:\n    * The probability Team A is selected on the first two days and another team on the third is (2/3) * (2/3) * (1/3) = 4/27.\n    * The probability Team A is selected on the first and third days, and another team on the second is (2/3) * (1/3) * (2/3) = 4/27.\n    * The probability Team A is selected on the second and third days, and another team on the first is (1/3) * (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/27.\n    * Total probability for Case 2: (4/27) + (4/27) + (4/27) = 12/27\n**3. Combine the Probabilities**\nThe probability of Team A being selected on at least two of the three days is the sum of the probabilities of Case 1 and Case 2:\n8/27 + 12/27 = **20/27**\n**Therefore, the probability that Team A is selected on at least two of the next three days is 20/27.** \n",
