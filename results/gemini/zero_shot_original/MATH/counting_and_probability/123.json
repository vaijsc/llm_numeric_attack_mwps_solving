        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Problem**\nImagine a square where the x-axis represents Alice's arrival time and the y-axis represents Bob's arrival time.  Each point within the square represents a possible combination of arrival times.\n* The bottom left corner of the square represents both Alice and Bob arriving at 5:00 (0 minutes late).\n* The top right corner of the square represents both Alice and Bob arriving at 6:00 (60 minutes late).\n**2. Define the Favorable Outcomes**\nWe want the sum of their lateness to be less than 45 minutes.  This means we need to find the area within the square where the points satisfy the condition:\n* Alice's lateness (x-coordinate) + Bob's lateness (y-coordinate) < 45\n**3.  Graph the Inequality**\nThe line x + y = 45 represents the boundary where the sum of their lateness is exactly 45 minutes.  Plot this line on our square.  All the points *below* this line represent combinations where their combined lateness is less than 45 minutes.\n**4. Calculate Areas**\n* **Total Area:** The square has sides of length 60, so its area is 60 * 60 = 3600.\n* **Favorable Area:**  The favorable area is a triangle below the line x + y = 45.  The base and height of this triangle are both 45 (since the line intersects the axes at 45 minutes).  Therefore, the area of the triangle is (1/2) * 45 * 45 = 1012.5.\n**5. Calculate the Probability**\nThe probability of the sum of their lateness being less than 45 minutes is the ratio of the favorable area to the total area:\nProbability = (Favorable Area) / (Total Area) = 1012.5 / 3600 = **17/48** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Problem**\nImagine a square where the x-axis represents Alice's arrival time (in minutes after 5:00) and the y-axis represents Bob's arrival time.  The square has sides of length 60 (representing the full hour from 5:00 to 6:00).\n**2. Favorable Outcomes**\nWe want the sum of their lateness to be less than 45 minutes.  This means we need to find the area within the square where the points satisfy: \n* Alice's lateness + Bob's lateness < 45\n**3. Graph the Inequality**\n* Draw the line  *x + y = 45*. This line represents the boundary where the sum of their lateness equals 45 minutes.\n* The area below this line represents the points where the sum of their lateness is less than 45 minutes.\n**4. Calculate Areas**\n* The area of the entire square is 60 * 60 = 3600.\n* The area of the triangle below the line x + y = 45 is (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 45 * 45 = 1012.5\n**5. Probability**\nThe probability that the sum of their lateness is less than 45 minutes is the ratio of the favorable area to the total area:\n* Probability = (1012.5) / (3600) = **405/1440** = **27/96** \n",

Let's represent this on our square.  Draw a line segment from the point (0, 45) to the point (45, 0). This line represents all the combinations of arrival times where the sum of their lateness is exactly 45 minutes.  \nThe region below this line represents all the combinations where the sum of their lateness is *less* than 45 minutes.

Each point within this square represents a possible combination of arrival times.\n**2. Identify the Favorable Outcomes**\nWe want the sum of their lateness to be less than 45 minutes.  Let's consider a few scenarios:\n* **Alice is 0 minutes late:** Bob can be late by up to 45 minutes.  This forms a diagonal line on the square.\n* **Alice is 15 minutes late:** Bob can be late by up to 30 minutes. This forms another diagonal line, parallel to the first.\n* **Alice is 30 minutes late:** Bob can be late by up to 15 minutes. \nContinue this pattern until you reach the point where Alice is 45 minutes late and Bob can't be late at all.  The area below these diagonal lines represents the favorable outcomes.\n**3. Calculate the Area**\n* **Total Area:** The square has sides of length 60 minutes, so its area is 60 * 60 = 3600 square minutes.\n* **Favorable Area:** The area below the diagonal lines forms a triangle with a base of 60 minutes and a height of 45 minutes. The area of this triangle is (1/2) * 60 * 45 = 1350 square minutes.\n**4. Calculate the Probability**\nThe probability of the sum of their lateness being less than 45 minutes is the ratio of the favorable area to the total area:\nProbability = (Favorable Area) / (Total Area) = 1350 / 3600 = **3/8** \n",

This means if Alice is *x* minutes late, Bob can be at most *45-x* minutes late.  We can plot this on our square:\n* **Line:**  Draw a line from (0, 45) to (45, 0).
