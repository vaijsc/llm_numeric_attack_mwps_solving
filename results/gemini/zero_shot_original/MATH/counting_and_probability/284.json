        "Here's how we can break down the problem:\n* **Understanding the Binomial Coefficient:**  The binomial coefficient  $\\binom{n}{k}$ represents the number of ways to choose a group of $k$ items from a set of $n$ distinct items, where order doesn't matter.\n* **Applying the Formula:** The formula for the binomial coefficient is:\n   \n   $$\\binom{n}{k} = \\dfrac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$$\n* **Evaluating for k = 0:** Let's substitute $k = 0$ into the formula:\n   $$\\binom{n}{0} = \\dfrac{n!}{0!(n-0)!}$$\n* **Simplifying:**  Recall that 0! (zero factorial) is defined as 1.  Simplifying the expression gives:\n   $$\\binom{n}{0} = \\dfrac{n!}{1 \\cdot n!} = 1$$\n**Therefore, for any positive integer n,  $\\binom{n}{0} = 1$.**\n**Interpretation:**  This makes sense because there's only one way to choose zero items from a set \u2013 you simply don't choose anything! \n",
