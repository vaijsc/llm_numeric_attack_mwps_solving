        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n1. **Treat the hairy-nosed wombats as one unit:** Since the hairy-nosed wombats are indistinguishable, we can treat them as a single unit for now. This means we have 4 units to arrange: the hairy-nosed wombat unit and the 4 other unique wombats.\n2. **Arrange the units:** We can arrange these 4 units in 4! (4 factorial) ways, which is 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24.\n3. **Arrange the hairy-nosed wombats:** Within the hairy-nosed wombat unit, we have 3 wombats.  Since they are indistinguishable, there's only 1 way to arrange them (they are always in the same order).\n4. **Multiply to find the total arrangements:** To get the total number of possible seating arrangements, we multiply the number of ways to arrange the units by the number of ways to arrange the hairy-nosed wombats within their unit: 24 * 1 = 24.\n**Therefore, there are 24 ways to seat the wombats in a row.** \n",

Now we have 4 \"units\" to arrange:\n*  The group of 3 hairy-nosed wombats\n*  The 4 other individual wombats\n**2.  Arrange the Units**\nWe have 4 units, and they can be arranged in 4! (4 factorial) ways:\n* 4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24\n**3.  Arrange the Hairy-Nosed Wombats**\nWithin their unit, the 3 hairy-nosed wombats can be arranged in 3! ways:\n* 3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6\n**4.  Combine the Possibilities**\nTo get the total number of arrangements, we multiply the number of ways to arrange the units by the number of ways to arrange the hairy-nosed wombats within their unit:\n* 24 * 6 = 144\n**Therefore, there are 144 ways to seat the wombats in a row.** \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this step-by-step:\n1. **Treat the hairy-nosed wombats as one unit:** Since they are indistinguishable, we can consider them as a single entity for now.  This means we have 5 \"units\" to arrange: 1 unit of 3 hairy-nosed wombats and 4 individual wombats.\n2. **Arrange the 5 units:** We can arrange 5 distinct units in 5! (5 factorial) ways, which is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.\n3. **Arrange the hairy-nosed wombats within their unit:**  The 3 hairy-nosed wombats can be arranged within their unit in 3! (3 factorial) ways, which is 3 * 2 * 1 = 6.\n4. **Combine the arrangements:** For every arrangement of the 5 units, we can arrange the hairy-nosed wombats within their unit.  So, we multiply the number of arrangements from steps 2 and 3: 120 * 6 = 720.\n**Therefore, there are 720 ways to seat the wombats in a row.** \n",
