    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "We want to deal with the restriction first.\n\nWithout worrying about which specific boys and girls go in which seats, in how many ways can the girls sit together?\n\nThere are 5 basic configurations of boys and girls:  $$GGGBBBB, BGGGBBB, BBGGGBB,$$ $$BBBGGGB, BBBBGGG$$ where $B$ is a boy and $G$ is a girl.  Then, within each configuration, there are $4!$ ways in which we can assign the 4 sons to seats, and $3!$ ways in which we can assign the 3 daughters to seats.\n\nTherefore the number of possible seatings is $5 \\times 4! \\times 3! = \\boxed{720}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Treat the girls as a single unit:**\nSince the three girls must sit together, consider them as one unit. Now we have 4 sons + 1 unit of girls = 5 entities to arrange.\n**2. Arrange the 5 entities:**\nThese 5 entities can be arranged in 5! (5 factorial) ways, which is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120 ways.\n**3. Arrange the girls within their unit:**\nThe three girls within their unit can be arranged in 3! (3 factorial) ways, which is 3 * 2 * 1 = 6 ways.\n**4. Multiply to find the total arrangements:**\nTo get the total number of arrangements where the girls sit together, we multiply the arrangements of the entities by the arrangements within the girls' unit:\n120 ways (entities) * 6 ways (girls) = **720 ways**\n**Therefore, there are 720 ways to seat the Smith family in a row of 7 chairs such that all 3 girls sit next to each other.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Treat the girls as a unit:**\nSince the girls must sit together, consider them as a single unit. Now we have 4 sons + 1 group of girls = 5 entities to arrange.\n**2. Arrange the entities:**\nThese 5 entities can be arranged in 5! (5 factorial) ways, which is 5*4*3*2*1 = 120 ways.\n**3. Arrange the girls within their unit:**\nThe 3 girls within their group can be arranged in 3! (3 factorial) ways, which is 3*2*1 = 6 ways.\n**4. Combine the arrangements:**\nFor every arrangement of the 5 entities, we have 6 ways to arrange the girls within their group. So the total number of arrangements is:\n120 ways (for entities) * 6 ways (for girls) = **720 ways**\n**Therefore, there are 720 ways to seat the Smith family with all 3 girls sitting next to each other.** \n",
