    "problem": "How many distinct six-letter rearrangements of the word ``Hawaii\" can I form?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "If every letter of ``Hawaii\" were different, there would be $6! = 6\\cdot 5 \\cdots 2 \\cdot 1$ distinct six-letter rearrangements, since for the first letter of the rearrangement there would be six letters to choose from, for the second there would be five, etc. However, ``Hawaii\" contains two copies of the letter $a$ and two copies of the letter $i$. Thus, we must divide by $2$ to eliminate the overcounting we get from two indistinguishable $a$'s, and we must divide by $2$ again to eliminate the overcounting we get from two indistinguishable $i$'s. Our final count is therefore $\\frac{6!}{2\\cdot 2}$. Canceling the $4$ top and bottom gives $6\\cdot 5 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 = 30 \\cdot 6 = \\boxed{180}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Count the letters:**\n* The word \"Hawaii\" has 6 letters.\n**2. Identify repeated letters:**\n* The letter 'a' appears twice.\n**3. Calculate the factorial:**\n* If all letters were unique, we would have 6! (6 factorial) ways to arrange them, which is 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720.\n**4. Account for repetitions:**\n* Since the letter 'a' appears twice, we've overcounted the arrangements. We need to divide our initial result by 2! (2 factorial) to correct this. 2! = 2 * 1 = 2.\n**5. Calculate the final answer:**\n* The number of distinct six-letter rearrangements of \"Hawaii\" is 720 / 2 = **360**. \n",

Calculate the total possible arrangements:**\n* If all letters were unique, there would be 6! (6 factorial) ways to arrange them: 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720.\n**4. Adjust for repetitions:**\n* Since 'a' appears twice, we've overcounted the arrangements. We need to divide the initial count by 2!

        "Here's how to figure out the number of distinct rearrangements of \"Hawaii\":\n**1. Count the letters:**\n* There are 6 letters in the word \"Hawaii\".\n**2. Consider repetitions:**\n* The letter 'a' appears twice.\n**3. Formula:**\n* The number of distinct rearrangements of *n* objects, where *k* of them are identical, is given by  n! / (k!). \n**4. Apply the formula:**\n* In our case, we have 6 letters (n = 6) and 2 'a's (k = 2).  \n* So, the number of rearrangements is 6! / (2!) = 720 / 2 = 360.\n**Therefore, there are 360 distinct six-letter rearrangements of the word \"Hawaii\".** \n",
