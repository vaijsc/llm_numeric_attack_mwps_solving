        "To get a sum of exactly 30 after three turns, Kendra needs to land on spaces that add up to 30.  Here are the possibilities:\n* **Turn 1:  Start (0) + Turn 2: 10 + Turn 3: 20**  \n* **Turn 1:  Start (0) + Turn 2: 20 + Turn 3: 10**\n* **Turn 1:  Start (0) + Turn 2: 15 + Turn 3: 15**\nNow, let's analyze the probabilities for each possibility:\n**Possibility 1 and 2:**\n* **Turn 1:** Kendra starts at \"Start\".\n* **Turn 2:** She needs to land on either a \"10\" or a \"20\". There are 8 spaces with \"10\" and 4 spaces with \"20\", making a total of 12 favorable spaces out of 24 total spaces. The probability of landing on a \"10\" or \"20\" is 12/24 = 1/2.\n* **Turn 3:** For this possibility, Kendra needs to land on the complement of the space she landed on in Turn 2 (if she landed on a \"10\" in Turn 2, she needs a \"20\" in Turn 3 and vice versa). This probability is also 1/2.\nThe probability of this entire possibility is (1) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.\n**Possibility 3:**\n* **Turn 1:** Kendra starts at \"Start\".\n* **Turn 2:** She needs to land on a \"15\". There are 4 spaces with \"15\" out of 24 total spaces. The probability of landing on a \"15\" is 4/24 = 1/6.\n* **Turn 3:** She needs to land on another \"15\", with the same probability of 1/6.\nThe probability of this entire possibility is (1) * (1/6) * (1/6) = 1/36.\nFinally, we add the probabilities of each possibility to get the total probability:\n1/4 + 1/4 + 1/36 = **10/36 = 5/18**\nTherefore, the probability that the sum of the numbers in the spaces on which Kendra will land will be exactly 30 after her third complete turn is **5/18**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Possible Moves**\n* Kendra has four possible moves: Up, Down, Left, Right.\n* Each move has an equal probability of 1/4.\n**2. Target Sum**\n* Kendra needs to land on squares that add up to exactly 30.\n**3. Analyze the Board**\n* Notice the board has a symmetrical pattern. This will help us with counting combinations. \n* To get a sum of 30, Kendra must land on squares with a sum of 10 each turn.\n**4. Combinations for a Sum of 10**\nHere are the combinations of squares that add up to 10:\n* **Start + 10:** This is the simplest and will happen if she moves to any of the '10' squares.\n* **5 + 5:**  This is possible in multiple ways.\n* **Start + 5 + 5:**  This is possible if she moves to a '5' square, then spins to move back to 'Start', and then lands on another '5' square.\n**5. Calculate Probabilities**\n* **Start + 10:**  The probability of landing on a '10' square is 8/16 (8 '10' squares out of 16 total squares) = 1/2. \n* **5 + 5:** We need to think about the different paths this can take. \n    * **Example:** She could move Up to a '5', then Right to another '5'. The probability of this sequence is (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16.\n    * There are multiple paths to reach a '5' and then another '5'. Since the board is symmetrical, we can focus on one quadrant and multiply our result by 4.\n    * Let's analyze the top-right quadrant. The probability of moving up to a '5' and then right to another '5' is (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16. We can repeat this for other paths in the quadrant (e.g., up to a '5' and then down to a '5').  There are 4 such paths in this quadrant, so the total probability in this quadrant is 4*(1/16) = 1/4. Since we have four quadrants, the total probability of getting two '5's is (1/4)*4 = 1.\n* **Start + 5 + 5:**  The probability of landing on a '5', moving back to 'Start', and then landing on another '5' is (1/4)*(1/4)*(1/4) = 1/64. We can repeat this logic for each of the four quadrants, so the total probability is (1/64)*4 = 1/16.\n**6. Total Probability**\nTo get a sum of 30, she needs to have one of these combinations happen three times in a row. \n* **(Start + 10) * 3:** The probability is (1/2)*(1/2)*(1/2) = 1/8\n* **(5 + 5) * 3:**  The probability is 1*1*1 = 1 \n* **(Start + 5 + 5) * 3:** The probability is (1/16)*(1/16)*(1/16) = 1/4096\n**7. Combining Probabilities**\nSince these three scenarios are mutually exclusive (only one can happen), we add their probabilities:\n1/8 + 1 + 1/4096 = **3281/4096**\n**Therefore, the probability that the sum of the numbers in the spaces on which Kendra will land will be exactly 30 after her third complete turn is 3281/4096.** \n",
        "Here's how we can break down the problem to find the probability:\n**1. Possible Moves:**\n* Kendra has 4 equally likely moves: Up, Down, Left, Right.\n**2. Target Sum:**\n* Kendra needs a total of 30 points after three turns.\n**3. Analyze Possible Paths:**\nTo reach a sum of 30, Kendra must land on squares with the following combinations of values:\n* **Scenario 1:** 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 \n    * Kendra needs to land on three \"10\" squares.\n* **Scenario 2:** 20 + 5 + 5 = 30\n    * Kendra needs to land on one \"20\" square and two \"5\" squares.\n* **Scenario 3:** 15 + 10 + 5 = 30\n    * Kendra needs to land on one \"15\" square, one \"10\" square, and one \"5\" square.\n* **Scenario 4:** 15 + 15 + 0 = 30\n    * Kendra needs to land on two \"15\" squares and the \"Start\" square.\n**4. Calculate Probabilities for Each Scenario:**\nLet's calculate the probability of each scenario:\n* **Scenario 1 (10 + 10 + 10):**\n    * The probability of landing on a \"10\" square in a single turn is 8/16 (there are 8 \"10\" squares out of 16 total).\n    * Probability of Scenario 1: (8/16) * (8/16) * (8/16) = 1/8\n* **Scenario 2 (20 + 5 + 5):**\n    * Probability of landing on a \"20\" square: 8/16\n    * Probability of landing on a \"5\" square: 12/16\n    * Probability of Scenario 2: (8/16) * (12/16) * (12/16) * 3 = 27/128  (We multiply by 3 because the \"5\" squares can be landed on in any order)\n* **Scenario 3 (15 + 10 + 5):**\n    * Probability of landing on a \"15\" square: 8/16\n    * Probability of landing on a \"10\" square: 8/16\n    * Probability of landing on a \"5\" square: 12/16\n    * Probability of Scenario 3: (8/16) * (8/16) * (12/16) * 3! = 9/32 (We multiply by 3! because the order of squares can vary)\n* **Scenario 4 (15 + 15 + 0):**\n    * Probability of landing on a \"15\" square: 8/16\n    * Probability of landing on the \"Start\" square: 1/16 \n    * Probability of Scenario 4: (8/16) * (8/16) * (1/16) * 3 = 3/256 (We multiply by 3 because the \"15\" squares can be landed on in any order)\n**5. Total Probability:**\nTo get the total probability of Kendra reaching a sum of 30, we add the probabilities of each scenario:\n1/8 + 27/128 + 9/32 + 3/256 = **43/128** \nTherefore, the probability that the sum of the numbers in the spaces on which Kendra will land will be exactly 30 after her third complete turn is **43/128**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this probability problem:\n**1.  Possible Outcomes:**\n* Kendra has 4 possible moves on each turn: Up, Down, Left, and Right.\n*  She takes 3 turns, so there are 4 * 4 * 4 = 64 possible outcomes.\n**2.  Favorable Outcomes (Summing to 30):**\nTo get a sum of 30, consider the possible combinations:\n* **One approach:** \n    * Land on \"Start\" twice and a space with a value of 30 once.\n    * There are 4 ways to land on \"Start\" for the first turn, 4 ways for the second turn, and 8 ways to land on a 30 for the third turn.  \n    * This gives 4 * 4 * 8 = 128 ways.\n* **Another approach:**\n    * Land on \"Start\" once, a space with a value of 20 once, and a space with a value of 10 once.\n    * There are 4 ways to land on \"Start\" for the first turn, 8 ways to land on a 20, and 8 ways to land on a 10.  This gives 4 * 8 * 8 = 256 ways.\n* **Important note:** We need to be careful about overcounting.  Consider the scenario where Kendra lands on a 20 first, then \"Start,\" then a 10. This is the same overall sequence as landing on \"Start,\" then a 20, then a 10.  We've counted this sequence twice.  \n* **Correcting overcounting:**  For every possible sequence of numbers, there are 3! = 6 ways to order them.  We've counted each sequence 6 times.\n**3.  Calculate the Probability:**\n* Total favorable outcomes: 128 + 256 = 384\n* After correcting for overcounting: 384 / 6 = 64\n* Probability: 64 (favorable outcomes) / 64 (total outcomes) = **1** \n**Therefore, the probability that the sum of the numbers on which Kendra will land will be exactly 30 after her third turn is 1.** \n",
        "Here's a step-by-step solution:\n**1.  Possible Outcomes:**\n* **Spinner:** Kendra has a 1/4 chance of landing on each of the spinner directions (Up, Down, Left, Right).\n* **Total Paths:**  Since she spins the spinner three times, there are 4 * 4 * 4 = 64 possible sequences of directions.\n**2.  Target Sum:**\n* Kendra needs a total of 30.  Since she starts at \"Start,\" we can ignore that square's value.\n* **First Two Turns:**  If Kendra lands on two 10's, she'll need a 10 on her third turn to reach 30.\n* **Third Turn:**  If she needs a 10 on her third turn, she needs to land on the square with the 10 on it.\n**3.  Finding Favorable Paths:**\n* **Scenario 1:**  Two 10s in the first two turns.  To achieve this, she must land on a 10 twice. Let's consider the possible paths:\n    * **10, 10, 10:**  There are 4 paths for each of the first two turns (any of the four directions leading to a 10). On the third turn, she must land on the 10, so there's only one possible direction. This gives us 4 * 4 * 1 = 16 paths.\n    * **10, other, 10:**  The second turn can be any of the other squares, meaning there are 7 possible squares.  For the third turn, there's only one path to the 10. This gives us 4 * 7 * 1 = 28 paths.\n    * **other, 10, 10:**  Similar to the previous case, this gives us 7 * 4 * 1 = 28 paths.\n* **Total Favorable Paths:**  Adding up all the favorable paths, we have 16 + 28 + 28 = 72 paths.\n**4.  Calculating Probability:**\n* **Probability:** The probability of Kendra landing on squares that sum to 30 is the number of favorable paths divided by the total number of possible paths.\n* **Result:**  The probability is 72/64, which simplifies to **9/8**.\n**Therefore, the probability that the sum of the numbers in the spaces on which Kendra will land will be exactly 30 after her third complete turn is 9/8.** \n"
