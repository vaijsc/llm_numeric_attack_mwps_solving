    "solution": "First, notice that Crystal cannot purchase an entire meal that includes Fried Rice.  The cheapest possibility would be Fried Rice, Soda, and Cookies, which still costs 50 cents too much.  Then, looking at the Pizza option, it is not possible for Crystal to purchase Frozen Yogurt with Pizza, as that would leave only one dollar for a drink.  Thus, she can purchase 2 different meals with Pizza (Pizza, Cookies, and either drink).  Since Fish and Chips cost the same as Pizza, there are likewise 2 different possible meals with Fish and Chips.  With a Corn Dog as her entree, Crystal can buy the most expensive meal (Corn Dog, Lemonade, and Frozen Yogurt), thus, she has 4 possible meals (Corn Dog, either drink, either dessert), making for $\\boxed{8\\text{ meals}}$ total.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Figure out the possible combinations for each category:**\n* **Entrees:** Crystal has 4 choices: Pizza, Corn Dog, Fish & Chips, Fried Rice\n* **Drinks:** Crystal has 2 choices: Lemonade, Soda\n* **Desserts:** Crystal has 2 choices: Frozen Yogurt, Cookies\n**2. Calculate the total possible meal combinations:**\nTo find the total number of possible meals, we multiply the number of choices for each category:\n4 entrees * 2 drinks * 2 desserts = 16 possible meals\n**3. Check affordability:**\nNow we need to see if Crystal can afford all 16 combinations.  Let's find the most expensive meal:\n* Most expensive entree: Fried Rice ($4.75)\n* Most expensive drink: Lemonade ($1.50)\n* Most expensive dessert: Frozen Yogurt ($3.00)\nTotal cost of most expensive meal: $4.75 + $1.50 + $3.00 = $9.25\nSince $9.25 is more than Crystal's $7.50 budget, she cannot afford all 16 combinations.\n**4. Find the affordable meals:**\nWe need to eliminate the meals that are too expensive.  Let's look at the possible combinations, starting with the most expensive entree:\n* **Fried Rice:**  Only the cheapest drink and dessert would make this meal affordable:\n    * Fried Rice + Soda + Cookies = $4.75 + $1.25 + $2.00 = $8.00 (Too expensive)\n* **Fish & Chips:** This entree is cheaper than Fried Rice.  Let's try some combinations:\n    * Fish & Chips + Lemonade + Frozen Yogurt = $3.50 + $1.50 + $3.00 = $8.00 (Too expensive)\n    * Fish & Chips + Lemonade + Cookies = $3.50 + $1.50 + $2.00 = $7.00 (Affordable!)\n    * Fish & Chips + Soda + Frozen Yogurt = $3.50 + $1.25 + $3.00 = $7.75 (Too expensive)\n    * Fish & Chips + Soda + Cookies = $3.50 + $1.25 + $2.00 = $6.75 (Affordable!)\n* **Corn Dog:** This entree is even cheaper than Fish & Chips, so all combinations with it will be affordable.\n* **Pizza:**  This is the cheapest entree, so all combinations will be affordable.\n**5. Count the affordable meals:**\nBy checking the affordability of combinations, we find that Crystal can afford:\n* **4** meals with the Corn Dog\n* **4** meals with the Pizza\n* **2** meals with Fish & Chips\nTotal affordable meals: 4 + 4 + 2 = **10**\n**Answer:** Crystal can afford to buy **10** distinct possible meals. \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem:\n**1. Figure out which entrees Crystal can afford:**\n* **Pizza:** $3.50 + (drink price) + (dessert price) <= $7.50 \n* **Corn Dog:** $2.50 + (drink price) + (dessert price) <= $7.50\n* **Fish & Chips:** $3.50 + (drink price) + (dessert price) <= $7.50\n* **Fried Rice:** $4.75 + (drink price) + (dessert price) <= $7.50 \nSince the drinks and desserts all cost less than $3.50, Crystal can afford any of the entrees. \n**2. Count the possible combinations:**\n* **Pizza:** \n    * Pizza + Lemonade + Frozen Yogurt\n    * Pizza + Lemonade + Cookies\n    * Pizza + Soda + Frozen Yogurt\n    * Pizza + Soda + Cookies\n* **Corn Dog:**\n    * Corn Dog + Lemonade + Frozen Yogurt\n    * Corn Dog + Lemonade + Cookies\n    * Corn Dog + Soda + Frozen Yogurt\n    * Corn Dog + Soda + Cookies\n* **Fish & Chips:**\n    * Fish & Chips + Lemonade + Frozen Yogurt\n    * Fish & Chips + Lemonade + Cookies\n    * Fish & Chips + Soda + Frozen Yogurt\n    * Fish & Chips + Soda + Cookies\n* **Fried Rice:**\n    * Fried Rice + Lemonade + Frozen Yogurt\n    * Fried Rice + Lemonade + Cookies\n    * Fried Rice + Soda + Frozen Yogurt\n    * Fried Rice + Soda + Cookies\n**3.
