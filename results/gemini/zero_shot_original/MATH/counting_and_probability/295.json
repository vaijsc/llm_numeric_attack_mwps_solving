        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding Pascal's Triangle**\n* **Rows and Diagonals:** Pascal's Triangle is organized into rows, starting with row 0. Each entry in the triangle is a number. Diagonals run from top to bottom. \n* **Third Diagonal:** The third diagonal (starting from the left) contains the triangular numbers.\n**Triangular Numbers**\n* **Formula:**  The nth triangular number is given by the formula:  T(n) = n(n+1)/2\n**Solution**\n1. **Identify the pattern:** The third diagonal of Pascal's Triangle contains the triangular numbers: 1, 3, 6, 10, 15... \n2. **Find the 50th triangular number:** Using the formula, we can calculate T(50):\n   T(50) = 50 * (50 + 1) / 2 = 50 * 51 / 2 = 1275\n**Answer:** The 50th triangular number is **1275**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding Pascal's Triangle and Triangular Numbers**\n* **Pascal's Triangle:** Each number in Pascal's Triangle is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. The first few rows look like this:\n   ```\n      1\n     1 1\n    1 2 1\n   1 3 3 1\n  1 4 6 4 1 \n   ```\n* **Third Diagonal:** The third diagonal of Pascal's Triangle consists of the numbers 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, and so on.\n* **Triangular Numbers:**  Triangular numbers are formed by adding consecutive natural numbers: \n    * 1st Triangular Number: 1 \n    * 2nd Triangular Number: 1 + 2 = 3\n    * 3rd Triangular Number: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6\n    * 4th Triangular Number: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10\n**The Connection**\nNotice that the numbers on the third diagonal of Pascal's Triangle are exactly the same as the triangular numbers! This is because each number on the third diagonal represents the sum of the numbers in the corresponding row of Pascal's Triangle up to that point, which is exactly how triangular numbers are defined.\n**Finding the 50th Triangular Number**\nThe formula for the *n*th triangular number is:\nn * (n + 1) / 2\nTo find the 50th triangular number, substitute *n* = 50:\n50 * (50 + 1) / 2 = 50 * 51 / 2 = **1275**\n**Therefore, the 50th triangular number is 1275.** \n",
