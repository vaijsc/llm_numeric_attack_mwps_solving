        "Here's how to figure out how many different-priced items Steve can pay for:\n**1. Calculate the total amount of money Steve has:**\n* One quarter = 25 cents\n* Two nickels = 2 x 5 cents = 10 cents\n* Three pennies = 3 x 1 cent = 3 cents\n* Total = 25 cents + 10 cents + 3 cents = 38 cents\n**2. Determine the possible combinations of coins:**\n* **38 cents:** He can pay for an item that costs 38 cents.\n* **37 cents:** He can pay for an item that costs 37 cents.\n* **36 cents:** He can pay for an item that costs 36 cents.\n* **35 cents:** He can pay for an item that costs 35 cents.\n* **33 cents:** He can pay for an item that costs 33 cents. \n* **32 cents:** He can pay for an item that costs 32 cents.\n* **31 cents:** He can pay for an item that costs 31 cents.\n* **30 cents:** He can pay for an item that costs 30 cents.\n* **28 cents:** He can pay for an item that costs 28 cents.\n* **27 cents:** He can pay for an item that costs 27 cents.\n* **25 cents:** He can pay for an item that costs 25 cents.\n* **23 cents:** He can pay for an item that costs 23 cents.\n* **22 cents:** He can pay for an item that costs 22 cents.\n* **20 cents:** He can pay for an item that costs 20 cents.\n* **18 cents:** He can pay for an item that costs 18 cents.\n* **15 cents:** He can pay for an item that costs 15 cents.\n* **13 cents:** He can pay for an item that costs 13 cents.\n* **12 cents:** He can pay for an item that costs 12 cents.\n* **10 cents:** He can pay for an item that costs 10 cents.\n* **8 cents:** He can pay for an item that costs 8 cents.\n* **5 cents:** He can pay for an item that costs 5 cents.\n* **3 cents:** He can pay for an item that costs 3 cents.\n**Answer:** Steve can pay for **22** different-priced items with his exact change. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Calculate the total value of Steve's coins:**\n* Quarter: $0.25\n* Two nickels: 2 * $0.05 = $0.10\n* Three pennies: 3 * $0.01 = $0.03\n* Total: $0.25 + $0.10 + $0.03 = $0.38\n**2. Determine the possible combinations of coins:**\n* **Using only pennies:**  Steve can pay for items costing 1, 2, or 3 cents.\n* **Using one nickel and pennies:** Steve can pay for items costing 5, 6, 7, or 8 cents.\n* **Using two nickels and pennies:** Steve can pay for items costing 10, 11, 12, 13, or 14 cents.\n* **Using one quarter and pennies:** Steve can pay for items costing 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, or 38 cents.\n* **Using one quarter, one nickel, and pennies:** Steve can pay for items costing 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, or 38 cents. \n* **Using one quarter, two nickels, and pennies:** Steve can pay for items costing 35, 36, 37, or 38 cents.\n**3. Count the unique prices:**\nBy listing all the possible prices, we see that Steve can pay for items with **18 different prices**. \n",
