        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Possible Outcomes**\n* Each toss of the nickel has two possible outcomes: heads (H) or tails (T).\n* With four tosses, there are 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 16 possible outcomes.\n**2. List the Outcomes**\nLet's list all the possible outcomes, using H for heads and T for tails:\n* HHHH\n* HHHT\n* HHTH\n* HTHH\n* THHH\n* HHTT\n* HTHT\n* HTTH\n* THHT\n* THTH\n* TTHH\n* HTTT\n* THTT\n* TTHT\n* TTTH\n* TTTT\n**3. Favorable Outcomes**\nWe want to find the outcomes with at least as many heads as tails. These are:\n* **HHHH** (4 heads, 0 tails)\n* **HHHT** (3 heads, 1 tail)\n* **HHTH** (3 heads, 1 tail)\n* **HTHH** (3 heads, 1 tail)\n* **THHH** (3 heads, 1 tail)\n* **HHTT** (2 heads, 2 tails)\n* **HTHT** (2 heads, 2 tails)\n* **HTTH** (2 heads, 2 tails)\n* **THHT** (2 heads, 2 tails)\n* **THTH** (2 heads, 2 tails)\n* **TTHH** (2 heads, 2 tails)\n**4. Calculate the Probability**\n* There are 11 favorable outcomes.\n* There are 16 total possible outcomes.\nTherefore, the probability of getting at least as many heads as tails is 11/16. \n",
