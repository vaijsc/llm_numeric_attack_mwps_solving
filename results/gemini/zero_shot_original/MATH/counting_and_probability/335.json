        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Possible Final Digits:**\n* Since the first digit is triple the final digit, the final digit must be small enough to allow for a triple that is still a single digit. \n* This means the final digit can be 1, 2, or 3 (because 3 x 3 = 9).\n**2.  Corresponding First Digits:**\n* If the final digit is 1, the first digit is 3.\n* If the final digit is 2, the first digit is 6.\n* If the final digit is 3, the first digit is 9.\n**3.  Counting the Possibilities:**\n* For each of the possible final digits (1, 2, 3), we have one corresponding first digit. \n* We can have any digit in the middle. This gives us 10 possibilities for the middle digit (0 through 9).\n**4.  Total Count:**\n* For each of the three possible final digits, we have 10 possibilities for the middle digit.\n* Therefore, there are 3 x 10 = **30** three-digit numbers that satisfy the given condition. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step by step:\n**1. Understand the Rule:**\n* We need 3-digit numbers where the first digit is triple the last digit.\n**2. Consider Possibilities for the Last Digit:**\n* The last digit cannot be greater than 3, because otherwise, tripling it would result in a first digit larger than 9 (which is not allowed for a single digit). \n* This means the last digit can be 1, 2, or 3.\n**3. Calculate the Corresponding First Digits:**\n* If the last digit is 1, the first digit is 3 * 1 = 3.\n* If the last digit is 2, the first digit is 3 * 2 = 6.\n* If the last digit is 3, the first digit is 3 * 3 = 9.\n**4. Determine the Middle Digit:**\n* The middle digit can be any number from 0 to 9, giving us 10 possibilities for each combination of first and last digits.\n**5. Count the Total Possibilities:**\n* For each of the three possible last digits (1, 2, 3), we have 10 possibilities for the middle digit.\n* Therefore, there are 3 * 10 = **30** three-digit numbers that meet the given condition. \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this:\n**1.  Possible Final Digits:**\n   * Since the first digit is triple the final digit, the final digit must be a factor of 9 (because the first digit must be a single digit).\n   * The factors of 9 are 1, 3, and 9.\n**2.  Numbers for Each Final Digit:**\n   * **Final Digit = 1:**  First digit = 3, so the numbers are 311, 312, 313... 319 (9 possibilities).\n   * **Final Digit = 3:** First digit = 9, so the numbers are 931, 932, 933... 939 (9 possibilities).\n   * **Final Digit = 9:** First digit = 27 (not a single digit), so there are no possibilities here.\n**3.  Total Possibilities:**\n   * We have 9 possibilities for each of the final digits 1 and 3, giving us a total of 9 + 9 = **18** possibilities.\n**Therefore, there are 18 three-digit numbers where the first digit is triple the final digit.** \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem:\n**1. Understanding the Requirements:**\n* We need 3-digit numbers, meaning the hundreds digit cannot be 0.\n* The hundreds digit must be triple the units digit.\n**2. Finding Possible Units Digits:**\n* Since the hundreds digit is a multiple of 3, the units digit must be a factor of 3. \n* The only factors of 3 that can be units digits are 1 and 3 (0 isn't allowed because it would make the hundreds digit 0).\n**3. Finding the Numbers:**\n* **If the units digit is 1:** The hundreds digit is 3 (3 times 1).  We have 311, 321, 331, ... 391  (9 possible numbers)\n* **If the units digit is 3:** The hundreds digit is 9 (3 times 3). We have 913, 923, 933, ... 993 (9 possible numbers)\n**4. Total Count:**\n* We have 9 numbers for each possible units digit, so in total, there are 9 + 9 = **18**  3-digit numbers that meet the condition. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step by step:\n**1. Understand the Requirements**\nWe need to find 3-digit numbers where the first digit is three times the last digit. \n**2. Consider the Possibilities**\n* **The last digit:** The last digit must be small enough that when tripled, it results in a single-digit number. This means the last digit can only be 1, 2, or 3.\n* **The first digit:**  The first digit will be three times the last digit.\n**3. List the Possibilities**\n* If the last digit is 1, the first digit is 3.\n* If the last digit is 2, the first digit is 6.\n* If the last digit is 3, the first digit is 9.\n**4. Count the Possibilities**\nFor each of the three possible last digits, we have a unique first digit.  We still need to consider the middle digit. Since the middle digit can be any of the ten digits from 0 to 9, we have 10 possibilities for the middle digit.\n**5. Calculate the Total**\nFor each of the three possible last digits, we have 10 possibilities for the middle digit.  So, there are a total of 3 * 10 = **30** possible 3-digit numbers that meet the condition. \n"
