        "Here's a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n**1. Understanding the Die**\n* We know the die is unfair, with face *F* having a higher probability than 1/6 and its opposite face having a lower probability than 1/6.\n* The other four faces have an equal probability of 1/6.\n* The sum of opposite faces is 7.\n**2. Finding the Probability of Opposite Face**\nLet the probability of face *F* be *p* and the probability of its opposite face be *q*.  Since the probabilities of all faces must sum to 1:\n*p + q + 4(1/6) = 1*\nSimplifying:\n*p + q = 2/3*\n**3. Setting Up the Two-Dice Scenario**\nWe're interested in the probability of getting a sum of 7 when rolling two dice.  We can get a sum of 7 with the following combinations:\n* (1, 6)\n* (2, 5)\n* (3, 4)\n* (4, 3)\n* (5, 2)\n* (6, 1)\n**4. Analyzing the Combinations**\n* **Combinations with *F* and its opposite:**  Let's assume *F* is the higher face.  Then the probability of getting (F, opposite of F) is *p* * q*. The probability of getting (opposite of F, F) is also *p* * q*.\n* **Other combinations:** The probability of getting any of the other combinations (like (1, 6) where neither face is *F* or its opposite) is (1/6) * (1/6) = 1/36.\n**5. Setting up the Equation**\nThe total probability of getting a sum of 7 is:\n*2(p * q) + 4(1/36) = 47/288*\n**6. Solving for *p* and *q***\nWe have two equations:\n* p + q = 2/3\n* 2(p * q) + 1/9 = 47/288\nSolving this system of equations, we find:\n* p = 5/9 \n* q = 1/9\n**7. Finding *m* and *n***\nWe are given that the probability of face *F* is *m/n* where *m* and *n* are relatively prime.  Since we found *p* = 5/9,  *m* = 5 and *n* = 9.\n**8. Calculating *m + n***\nFinally, *m + n* = 5 + 9 = **14**. \n",
        "Here's a step-by-step solution:\n**1. Understanding the Die**\n* **Opposite Faces:** The sum of the numbers on opposite faces is 7. This means the opposite faces are (1, 6), (2, 5), and (3, 4).\n* **Unfair Probabilities:**  Let's say face *F* is the face with a probability greater than 1/6. The opposite face of *F* has a probability less than 1/6. All other faces have a probability of 1/6.\n**2. Setting Up the Probabilities**\n* Let the probability of face *F* be  *p*.\n* The probability of the face opposite *F* is 1 - *p*.\n* The probability of each of the other four faces is 1/6.\n**3. Finding the Probability of Rolling a 7**\nTo get a sum of 7 when rolling two dice, we need to consider the possible combinations:\n* **F and the face opposite F:** The probability of this is *p*(1-*p*).\n* **1 and 6:**  The probability of this is (1/6)(1/6) = 1/36.\n* **2 and 5:**  The probability of this is (1/6)(1/6) = 1/36.\n* **3 and 4:**  The probability of this is (1/6)(1/6) = 1/36.\n**4. Setting up the Equation**\nThe total probability of rolling a sum of 7 is the sum of the probabilities of these combinations:\n*p*(1-*p*) + 1/36 + 1/36 + 1/36 = 47/288\n**5. Solving for p**\nSimplifying the equation:\n*p*(1-*p*) + 1/12 = 47/288\n*p*(1-*p*) = 13/288\nThis is a quadratic equation.  Expanding and rearranging:\n*p\u00b2 - *p* + 13/288 = 0\nUsing the quadratic formula to solve for *p*:\n*p* = (1 \u00b1 \u221a(1 - 4(13/288)) ) / 2 \n*p* = (1 \u00b1 \u221a(145/288)) / 2\nSince *p* is a probability and must be between 0 and 1, we take the positive solution:\n*p* = (1 + \u221a(145/288)) / 2\n**6. Finding m + n**\nWe need to express *p* as a fraction in simplest form.  To do this, we need to rationalize the denominator:\n*p* = (1 + \u221a145) / (2\u221a288) = (1 + \u221a145) / (24\u221a2) = (1 + \u221a145)(\u221a2) / (24 * 2) = (\u221a2 + \u221a290) / 48\nThus, *m* = \u221a2 + \u221a290 and *n* = 48. \nFinally, *m* + *n* = **\u221a2 + \u221a290 + 48**. \n",
        "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understanding the Unfair Die**\n* **Opposite Faces:**  The die is designed so that the sum of opposite faces is 7. This means the pairs are: (1, 6), (2, 5), and (3, 4).\n* **Face F:**  The probability of rolling face *F* is greater than 1/6, and the probability of rolling the face opposite *F* is less than 1/6.\n* **Other Faces:**  The probability of rolling each of the remaining four faces is 1/6.\n**2. Setting up Probabilities**\nLet's use variables to represent the probabilities:\n*  *P(F)* = Probability of rolling face *F* \n*  *P(Opposite F)* = Probability of rolling the face opposite *F*\nSince the sum of all probabilities must be 1:\n*  *P(F)* + *P(Opposite F)* + 4 * (1/6) = 1 \n**3.  Analyzing the Sum of 7**\nWe are given that the probability of rolling a sum of 7 with two dice is 47/288.  Let's figure out how to get a sum of 7:\n* **Scenario 1:**  Roll *F* on the first die and the opposite of *F* on the second die.\n* **Scenario 2:**  Roll the opposite of *F* on the first die and *F* on the second die. \nThe probability of each scenario is:\n* *P(F) * P(Opposite F)* \n**4. Setting up the Equation**\nThe probability of getting a sum of 7 is the sum of the probabilities of the two scenarios:\n* 2 * *P(F) * P(Opposite F)*  = 47/288\n**5. Solving for P(F)**\nWe now have two equations:\n* *P(F)* + *P(Opposite F)* + 4 * (1/6) = 1\n* 2 * *P(F) * P(Opposite F)*  = 47/288\nWe can solve for *P(F)* using substitution. \n1. Solve the first equation for *P(Opposite F)*:\n   *P(Opposite F)* = 1 - *P(F)* - 2/3\n2. Substitute this value of *P(Opposite F)* into the second equation:\n   *2 * P(F) * (1 - P(F) - 2/3) = 47/288*\n3. Simplify and solve the quadratic equation:\n   *6P(F)^2 - 6P(F) + 1/144 = 0*\n   *P(F) = (6 \u00b1 \u221a35)/12*\n4. Choose the valid solution. Since *P(F)* must be greater than 1/6, we take the solution:\n   *P(F) = (6 + \u221a35)/12*\n**6. Finding m + n**\nWe are given that *P(F) = m/n* where *m* and *n* are relatively prime. Therefore:\n* *m = 6 + \u221a35*\n* *n = 12*\nFinally, *m + n = 6 + \u221a35 + 12 = **18 + \u221a35** \n",
        "Here's a step-by-step solution:\n**1. Define Variables**\n* Let  *p* be the probability of obtaining face *F*.\n* Let *q* be the probability of obtaining the face opposite *F*.\n* Let *r* be the probability of obtaining any of the other four faces (which is 1/6).\n**2. Set Up Equations**\nWe know the following:\n*  *p* > 1/6\n*  *q* < 1/6\n*  *p* + *q* + 4*r* = 1  (The sum of all probabilities must equal 1)\n*  *r* = 1/6\n**3. Solve for *p* and *q***\nSubstituting *r* = 1/6 into the equation *p* + *q* + 4*r* = 1, we get:\n* *p* + *q* = 1/3\nSince *p* > 1/6 and *q* < 1/6, we can conclude that *p* is greater than 1/6 but less than 1/3.\n**4. Calculate the Probability of Rolling a 7**\nTo get a sum of 7 when rolling two dice, the possible combinations are:\n* (1, 6) and (6, 1)\n* (2, 5) and (5, 2)\n* (3, 4) and (4, 3)\n* (*F*, opposite of *F*) and (opposite of *F*, *F*) \nLet's calculate the probability of each of these combinations:\n* (1, 6) and (6, 1):  (1/6) * (1/6) * 2 = 1/18\n* (2, 5) and (5, 2):  (1/6) * (1/6) * 2 = 1/18\n* (3, 4) and (4, 3):  (1/6) * (1/6) * 2 = 1/18\n* (*F*, opposite of *F*) and (opposite of *F*, *F*):  *p* *q* * 2\nThe total probability of rolling a 7 is:\n* 1/18 + 1/18 + 1/18 + 2*p*q = 47/288\n**5. Solve for *p* and *q***\nSimplifying the equation from step 4:\n* 1/6 + 2*p*q = 47/288\n* 2*p*q = 1/16\n* p*q = 1/32\nWe know *p* + *q* = 1/3. Now we have a system of two equations with two unknowns:\n* *p* + *q* = 1/3\n* *p* *q* = 1/32\nSolving this system (you can use substitution or the quadratic formula), we find:\n* *p* = 1/4\n* *q* = 1/8\n**6. Find *m* + *n***\nThe probability of obtaining face *F* is *p* = 1/4 = *m*/ *n*. \nTherefore, *m* + *n* = 1 + 4 = **5**. \n",
        "Let's break down this problem step by step.\n**1. Understanding the Die**\n* **Opposite Faces:** The sum of the numbers on opposite faces is 7.

Analyzing the Sum of 7**\nWhen rolling two dice, there are a few ways to get a sum of 7:\n* **F and its opposite face:** This has probability *p* *q*.\n* **1 and 6:** This has probability (1/6) * (1/6) = 1/36 \n* **2 and 5:** This has probability (1/6) * (1/6) = 1/36 \n* **3 and 4:** This has probability (1/6) * (1/6) = 1/36 \nThe total probability of rolling a sum of 7 is then:\n* *p* *q* + 1/36 + 1/36 + 1/36 = *p* *q* + 1/12\nWe are given that this probability is 47/288:\n* *p* *q* + 1/12 = 47/288\n**5. Solving for *p* and *q***\nWe have two equations:\n1. *p* + *q* = 1/3\n2. *p* *q* + 1/12 = 47/288\nSolve for *p* and *q* using substitution or elimination.

Finding m + n**\nThe probability of obtaining face *F* is *p* = 1/4 = *m*/ *n*.  Therefore, *m* = 1 and *n* = 4.\nFinally, *m* + *n* = 1 + 4 = **5**. \n"
