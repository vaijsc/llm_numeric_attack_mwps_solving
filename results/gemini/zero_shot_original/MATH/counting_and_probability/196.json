        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understanding Obtuse Triangles**\nAn obtuse triangle has one angle greater than 90 degrees.  The Law of Cosines tells us that in any triangle with sides of length $a$, $b$, and $c$, where $c$ is the longest side:\n $$c^2 > a^2 + b^2$$\n**2. Setting Up the Problem**\n* Randy's calculator generates random numbers between 0 and 1.  Let's call these numbers  $x$ and $y$.\n* We need to find the probability that these numbers, along with 1, form an obtuse triangle.  This means one of the following must be true:\n    *  $1^2 > x^2 + y^2$ \n    *  $x^2 > 1^2 + y^2$\n    *  $y^2 > 1^2 + x^2$\n**3. Visualizing the Solution**\nWe can visualize this problem in the coordinate plane.  Consider a square with vertices (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), and (0,1).  Any point $(x,y)$ inside this square represents a possible pair of random numbers.\n* **The inequality  $1^2 > x^2 + y^2$ represents a circle centered at the origin with radius 1.**  Points inside this circle satisfy the inequality.\n* **The inequalities $x^2 > 1^2 + y^2$ and $y^2 > 1^2 + x^2$ represent circles centered at (1,0) and (0,1) respectively, also with radius 1.**\n**4. Finding the Probability**\n* The area of the square is 1.\n* The area of each circle is $\\pi (1^2) = \\pi$.\n* The area of the region where the three circles overlap is a bit tricky to calculate directly.  Instead, we can find the area of the square minus the area of the three circles, and then divide by 2 (since the region where the circles overlap is symmetrical).\n[asy]\nunitsize (1 cm);\ndraw((0,0)--(1,0)--(1,1)--(0,1)--cycle);\ndraw(Circle((0,0),1));\ndraw(Circle((1,0),1));\ndraw(Circle((0,1),1));\nlabel(\"$x$\", (1.2,0), S);\nlabel(\"$y$\", (0,1.2), W);\n[/asy]\n* **Area of the square:** 1\n* **Area of the three circles:** 3\u03c0 \n* **Area of the overlap region:**  (1 - 3\u03c0)/2\n* **Probability of an obtuse triangle:** [(1 - 3\u03c0)/2] / 1 = (1 - 3\u03c0)/2\n**5.

The key to forming an obtuse triangle is the **Law of Cosines:**\nFor a triangle with sides of length *a*, *b*, and *c*, where *c* is the longest side, the Law of Cosines states:\n*c\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - 2ab cos(C)* \nFor the triangle to be obtuse, the angle *C* opposite the longest side must be greater than 90 degrees.
