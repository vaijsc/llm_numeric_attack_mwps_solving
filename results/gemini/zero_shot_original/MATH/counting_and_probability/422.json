        "Here's how to break down the problem:\n* **Each student has two choices:** Chipotle or Panda Express.\n* **There are 10 students:**  We need to consider the choices of all 10.\n**Thinking step-by-step:**\n* **Student 1:** Has 2 choices (Chipotle or Panda Express).\n* **Student 2:** Also has 2 choices (Chipotle or Panda Express).  Since Student 1's choice doesn't affect Student 2's, we have 2 * 2 = 4 possible combinations for the first two students.\n* **Student 3:**  Again, has 2 choices, giving us 2 * 2 * 2 = 8 possibilities for the first three students.\n**The Pattern**\nYou can see a pattern emerging.  For each additional student, we multiply the number of possibilities by 2.\n**Calculation**\nSince we have 10 students, the total number of ways they can choose where to eat is:\n2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 2\u00b9\u2070 = **1024**\n**Therefore, there are 1024 different ways the students can collectively go to lunch.** \n",
        "Here's how to break down the problem:\n* **Each student has two choices:** Chipotle or Panda Express.\n* **We have 10 students:**  This means we're making 10 independent decisions (one for each student).\n**Therefore, the total number of ways the students can go to lunch is:**\n2 (choices for student 1) * 2 (choices for student 2) * ... * 2 (choices for student 10) = 2^10 = **1024**\n**So there are 1024 different ways the group of 10 students can go to lunch.** \n",
        "Here's how to break down the problem:\n* **Each student has two choices:** Chipotle or Panda Express.\n* **There are 10 students:** We need to account for the choices of all 10.\nSince each student has two options, and there are 10 students, we multiply the number of possibilities for each student together:\n2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 2^10 = **1024**\n**Therefore, there are 1024 different ways the students can collectively go to lunch.** \n",
        "Here's how to break down the problem:\n* **Each student has two choices:** Chipotle or Panda Express.\n* **We have 10 students:**  This means we have 10 independent decisions.\n**To find the total number of possibilities, we multiply the number of choices for each student:**\n2 choices * 2 choices * 2 choices * ... (10 times) = 2^10\n**Therefore, there are 2^10 = 1024 different ways the students can collectively go to lunch.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Step 1:  Consider the choices for each student**\n* Each student has two options: Chipotle or Panda Express.\n**Step 2:  Apply the Multiplication Principle**\n* Since each student has two independent choices, we multiply the number of choices together for all 10 students.\n**Step 3:  Calculate the total number of ways**\n* There are 2 choices for each of the 10 students, so the total number of ways is 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 2^10 = **1024**\n**Answer:** There are 1024 different ways the students can collectively go to lunch. \n"
