    "solution": "With the original format, any one of 26 letters can be used for each of the first three slots, and any one of 10 digits can be used for each of the last three. Therefore, there are $26^3 \\cdot 10^3$ license plates possible. With the new format, any one of 26 letters can be used for each of the first four slots, and any one of 10 digits can be used for each of the last two: thus, there are now $26^4 \\cdot 10^2$ license plates possible. Subtracting the two yields an answer of $26^3 \\cdot 10^2 \\cdot (26 - 10)$, which equals $\\boxed{28121600}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Calculate the number of plates with the old format:**\n* There are 26 letters in the alphabet, so for each of the three letter positions, there are 26 possibilities.\n* There are 10 digits (0-9) for each of the three digit positions.\n* Total number of plates with the old format: 26 * 26 * 26 * 10 * 10 * 10 = 17,576,000\n**2. Calculate the number of plates with the new format:**\n* Four letter positions with 26 possibilities each: 26 * 26 * 26 * 26\n* Two digit positions with 10 possibilities each: 10 * 10\n* Total number of plates with the new format: 26 * 26 * 26 * 26 * 10 * 10 = 456,976,000\n**3. Find the difference:**\n* Difference: 456,976,000 - 17,576,000 = 439,400,000\n**Answer:** The positive difference between the number of plates available with the new format and the number of plates available with the old format is **439,400,000**. \n",
