    "solution": "There are 55 ways to choose the first Republican, 54 ways to choose the second Republican, and 53 ways to choose the third Republican; however, we must divide by $3!$ because order does not matter.  So the number of ways to choose Republicans is $\\dfrac{55 \\times 54 \\times 53}{3!} = 26,\\!235$. There are 45 ways to choose the first Democrat and 44 ways to choose the second Democrat, but we must divide by $2!$ because order does not matter.  So the number of ways to choose the Democrats is $\\dfrac{45 \\times 44}{2!} = 990$.  So there are $26,\\!235 \\times 990 = \\boxed{25,\\!972,\\!650}$ ways to choose a committee.",

        "Here's how to break down the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Choosing Republicans:**\n* We need to choose 3 Republicans out of 55.  This is a combination problem, as the order we choose them in doesn't matter.\n* The formula for combinations is nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!), where n is the total number of items and r is the number you're choosing.\n* So, the number of ways to choose 3 Republicans is 55C3 = 55! / (3! * 52!) = 34,105\n**2. Choosing Democrats:**\n* We need to choose 2 Democrats out of 45.\n* The number of ways to choose 2 Democrats is 45C2 = 45! / (2! * 43!) = 990\n**3. Combining the Choices:**\n* To get the total number of ways to form the committee, we multiply the number of ways to choose Republicans by the number of ways to choose Democrats.\n* Total combinations: 34,105 * 990 = 33,744,450\n**Therefore, there are 33,744,450 ways to choose a 5-person committee consisting of 3 Republicans and 2 Democrats.** \n",
