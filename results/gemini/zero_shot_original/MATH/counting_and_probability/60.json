        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Choosing the vowel:**\n* We have 5 choices for the vowel (A, E, I, O, or U).\n**2. Choosing the consonants:**\n* There are 21 consonants in the alphabet (26 total letters - 5 vowels = 21 consonants).\n* We need to choose 2 consonants, and the order doesn't matter. This is a combination problem.\n**3. Combinations:**\n* The number of ways to choose *r* items from a set of *n* items (where order doesn't matter) is given by the combination formula:  \n   nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)\n   In our case, we have 21 consonants (n = 21) and we want to choose 2 (r = 2).  So:\n   21C2 = 21! / (2! * 19!) = (21 * 20) / (2 * 1) = 210\n**4. Total Ways:**\n* To get the total number of ways to choose the letters, we multiply the number of ways to choose the vowel by the number of ways to choose the consonants:\n   5 vowels * 210 consonant combinations = **1050 ways**\n**Therefore, there are 1050 ways to choose 3 distinct letters of the alphabet, with one vowel and two consonants, without regard to order.** \n",

Combining the choices:**\n* For each choice of vowel, we have 210 ways to choose the consonants. \n* Therefore, the total number of ways to choose 3 letters (1 vowel, 2 consonants) is: 5 * 210 = **1050**\n**So, there are 1050 ways to choose 3 distinct letters of the alphabet, with one vowel and two consonants, without regard to order.** \n",
