        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding Remainders**\nThe remainder when a number is divided by another number is the amount \"left over\" after the division. For example, the remainder when 11 is divided by 3 is 2 (because 11 = 3 x 3 + 2).\n**Key Idea: Cyclical Patterns of Remainders**\nWhen you raise a number to successive powers, the remainders when divided by a fixed number often start repeating in a cycle.  Let's explore this with our example:\n* **Step 1:** Find the remainder when $301^1$ is divided by 10,000.  The remainder is 301.\n* **Step 2:** Find the remainder when $301^2$ is divided by 10,000. This is the same as the remainder of (301 x 301) / 10,000.  We can calculate this directly:\n    * 301 x 301 = 90601\n    * The remainder of 90601 / 10,000 is 601.\n* **Step 3:** Find the remainder when $301^3$ is divided by 10,000. This is the same as the remainder of (301 x 301 x 301) / 10,000.  We can simplify this by using our previous result:\n    * (301 x 301 x 301) = (301 x 90601)\n    * The remainder of 90601 / 10,000 is 601.\n    * So, the remainder of (301 x 90601) / 10,000 is the same as the remainder of (301 x 601) / 10,000.\n    * Calculate: 301 x 601 = 181201\n    * The remainder of 181201 / 10,000 is 1201.\n* **Step 4:** Find the remainder when $301^4$ is divided by 10,000.  We can use the same approach:\n    * (301 x 301 x 301 x 301) = (301 x 181201)\n    * The remainder of 181201 / 10,000 is 1201.\n    * So, the remainder of (301 x 181201) / 10,000 is the same as the remainder of (301 x 1201) / 10,000.\n    * Calculate: 301 x 1201 = 361501\n    * The remainder of 361501 / 10,000 is **1501**.\n**Therefore, the remainder when $301^4$ is divided by 10,000 is 1501.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding the Problem:**\nWe need to find the last four digits of $301^4$.  This is the same as finding the remainder when $301^4$ is divided by 10,000.\n**Using Cyclicity:**\nNotice that the last two digits of powers of 301 follow a pattern:\n* 301\u00b9 = 301\n* 301\u00b2 = 90601\n* 301\u00b3 = 27270301\n* 301\u2074 = 818180601\nThe last two digits cycle through 01, 01. \n**Finding the Remainder:**\nSince the last two digits of 301\u2074 are 01, the remainder when $301^4$ is divided by 10,000 is **1**. \n**Therefore, the remainder is 1.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**Understanding the Problem**\nFinding the remainder when a number is divided by 10,000 is the same as looking at the last four digits of that number. \n**Simplifying the Calculation**\n* **Focus on the last four digits:** Since we only care about the last four digits, we can ignore the \"3\" in 301 and focus on 01^4.\n* **Calculate 01^4:**  01^4 = 0001.\n**The Answer**\nThe remainder when 301^4 is divided by 10,000 is **0001** (or simply 1). \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding the Problem**\nWe're asked for the remainder when a large number, $301^4$, is divided by 10,000.  This means we're looking for the last four digits of the result. \n**Using Cyclicity**\nNotice that the units digit of a power of 301 follows a pattern:\n* $301^1$ ends in 1\n* $301^2$ ends in 1 \n* $301^3$ ends in 1\n* $301^4$ ends in 1\nThis pattern continues because multiplying a number ending in 1 by another number ending in 1 always results in a number ending in 1.\n**Focusing on the Last Four Digits**\nSince the units digit of $301^4$ is 1, let's consider the last four digits of the result:\n* $301^2 = 90601$ \n* $301^4 = (301^2)^2 = 90601^2$\nTo find the last four digits of $90601^2$, we only need to focus on the last four digits of 90601:\n* $0601^2 = 361201$\nTherefore, the last four digits of $301^4$ are **1201**.  This is also the remainder when $301^4$ is divided by 10,000.\n**Answer:** The remainder when $301^4$ is divided by 10,000 is **1201**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding Remainders**\nThe remainder when a number is divided by another number tells us how much is \"left over\" after the division is complete. For example, the remainder when 13 is divided by 5 is 3, because 13 can be written as 5 * 2 + 3.\n**Simplifying the Problem**\nInstead of directly calculating  301\u2074, we can use some clever observations to make the problem easier:\n* **Finding a Pattern:** Notice that 301\u00b2 = 90601.  This means the last four digits of 301\u00b2 are 0601.  \n* **Repeating the Pattern:**  When we square this result, (301\u00b2)\u00b2, we are essentially multiplying 0601 by itself.  Since the last four digits of the result will be determined by the multiplication of the last four digits, we know the last four digits of 301\u2074 will be the same as the last four digits of 0601 * 0601.\n**Calculating the Remainder**\n1. **Multiply the last four digits:** 0601 * 0601 = 361201\n2. **Isolate the last four digits:** The last four digits of this product are 1201.\n**Therefore, the remainder when 301\u2074 is divided by 10,000 is 1201.** \n"
