        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n* We have 15 students to choose from.\n* We need to select 13 of them.\n* The order in which we choose the students doesn't matter (it's just a team).\n**Solution:**\nThis is a classic combination problem, where we need to figure out how many ways we can choose a group of 13 from a larger group of 15.  Here's the formula:\n* **nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)**\nWhere:\n* n = the total number of items (15 students)\n* r = the number of items to be chosen (13 students)\n* ! = factorial (e.g., 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)\n**Let's plug in the numbers:**\n* 15C13 = 15! / (13! * (15-13)!)\n* 15C13 = 15! / (13! * 2!)\n* 15C13 = (15 * 14 * 13!)/(13! * 2 * 1)\n* 15C13 = (15 * 14) / 2\n* 15C13 = 105\n**Answer:** There are **105** ways to select 13 students from a group of 15 to serve on a chalkboard-cleaning team. \n",
