    "solution": "There are $2^{10} = 1024$ possible outcomes of the 10 coin flips. The probability that we flip at least 6 heads is equal to the probability that we flip at least 6 tails, by symmetry.  Let's call this probability $p$.  The only other possibility is that we flip exactly 5 heads and 5 tails, for which the probability is $\\dfrac{\\binom{10}{5}}{2^{10}} = \\dfrac{252}{1024} = \\dfrac{63}{256}$.  Therefore, $\\dfrac{63}{256} + 2p = 1$, giving $$ p=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(1-\\frac{63}{256}\\right)=\\boxed{\\frac{193}{512}} $$",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\nWe want to find the probability of getting 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 heads in 10 coin flips.\n**2. Calculating Individual Probabilities**\n* **Probability of exactly 6 heads:**  This is a binomial probability problem.  The formula is:\n   P(exactly k successes in n trials) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n   Where:\n     * n = number of trials (10 flips)\n     * k = number of successes (6 heads)\n     * p = probability of success on a single trial (0.5 for heads)\n     * (n choose k) = the binomial coefficient, calculated as n! / (k! * (n-k)!)\n   So, for exactly 6 heads:\n   P(exactly 6 heads) = (10 choose 6) * (0.5)^6 * (0.5)^4 = 210 * (0.5)^10 \n* **Repeat for 7, 8, 9, and 10 heads:** You'd follow the same formula, changing the value of 'k' in each case.\n**3. Summing the Probabilities**\nSince we want \"at least 6 heads\", we need to add the probabilities we calculated for 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 heads.\n**4. Simplifying (Optional)**\nInstead of calculating each probability individually, there's a shortcut. Notice that the probability of getting exactly k heads is the same as the probability of getting exactly (10-k) tails.  Therefore:\n* P(at least 6 heads) = P(6 heads) + P(7 heads) + P(8 heads) + P(9 heads) + P(10 heads)\n* P(at least 6 heads) = P(4 tails) + P(3 tails) + P(2 tails) + P(1 tail) + P(0 tails) \nYou can calculate this sum more efficiently.\n**5. Calculating the Result**\nUsing a calculator or a binomial probability table, you'll find:\nP(at least 6 heads) \u2248 0.377 \n**Therefore, the probability of getting at least 6 heads in 10 coin flips is approximately 37.7%.** \n",
        "Here's how to break down the problem and find the solution:\n**1.  Understanding the Problem**\nWe want to find the probability of getting 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 heads in 10 coin flips.\n**2.  Possible Outcomes**\n* Each coin flip has two possible outcomes: heads (H) or tails (T).\n* With 10 flips, there are 2^10 = 1024 possible outcomes.\n**3.  Calculating Probabilities for Specific Cases**\nLet's calculate the probability for each case:\n* **6 Heads:**  The number of ways to get 6 heads is given by the combination formula: 10 choose 6 (\u00b9\u2070C\u2086) = 210.  Each specific outcome (e.g., HHHTTTTTH) has probability (1/2)^10 = 1/1024.  So, the probability of 6 heads is (210/1024)\n* **7 Heads:**  \u00b9\u2070C\u2087 = 120.  Probability: (120/1024)\n* **8 Heads:**  \u00b9\u2070C\u2088 = 45.  Probability: (45/1024)\n* **9 Heads:**  \u00b9\u2070C\u2089 = 10.  Probability: (10/1024)\n* **10 Heads:** \u00b9\u2070C\u2081\u2080 = 1.  Probability: (1/1024)\n**4.  Adding the Probabilities**\nTo get the probability of at least 6 heads, we add the probabilities of each of these cases:\n(210/1024) + (120/1024) + (45/1024) + (10/1024) + (1/1024) = **386/1024**\n**5.  Simplifying the Answer**\nThis fraction can be simplified to **193/512**, which is approximately **0.377**.\n**Therefore, the probability of getting at least 6 heads in 10 coin flips is approximately 0.377 or about 37.7%.** \n",

This means we need to consider the probabilities of getting 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 heads.\n**2. Calculating Individual Probabilities**\n* **Probability of exactly k heads:** For any specific number of heads (k), the probability is calculated using the binomial probability formula:\n   P(exactly k heads) = (nCk) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k) \n   where:\n      * n = number of trials (10 coin flips)\n      * k = number of successes (number of heads)\n      * p = probability of success on a single trial (0.5 for a fair coin)\n      * nCk = the binomial coefficient, which represents the number of ways to choose k items from a set of n. It's calculated as n! / (k! * (n-k)!).\n* **Examples:**\n    * P(exactly 6 heads) = (10C6) * (0.5)^6 * (0.5)^4 = 210 * 0.015625 * 0.0625 = 0.2051\n    * P(exactly 7 heads) = (10C7) * (0.5)^7 * (0.5)^3 = 120 * 0.0078125 * 0.125 = 0.1172\n    * And so on...\n**3. Adding the Probabilities Together**\nSince we want \"at least 6 heads\", we need to add the probabilities of getting 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 heads:\nP(at least 6 heads) = P(6 heads) + P(7 heads) + P(8 heads) + P(9 heads) + P(10 heads)\n**4. Calculation (You can use a calculator or spreadsheet for this):**\nP(at least 6 heads) = 0.2051 + 0.1172 + 0.0439 + 0.0098 + 0.0010 = **0.377** (approximately)\n**Answer:** The probability of getting at least 6 heads in 10 flips of a fair coin is approximately 0.377 or 37.7%. \n",
