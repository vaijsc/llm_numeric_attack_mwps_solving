        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n* **Step 1:  The Smallest Book**  Since the smallest book must go in the spot with the hole, there's only **1** way to place it.\n* **Step 2: The Remaining Books**  Now we have 3 books left.  The next book can be placed in any of the 3 remaining spots. Then, there are 2 spots left for the next book, and finally, only 1 spot left for the last book.\n* **Step 3: Total Arrangements** To find the total number of arrangements, we multiply the number of choices for each step: 1 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 6\n**Answer:** Alex can arrange his books in **6** different ways. \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem:\n**Step 1:  Understanding the Restriction**\nThe hole in the bookshelf means Alex can't place the smallest book at the end with the hole. This limits where he can put the smallest book.\n**Step 2:  Placing the Smallest Book**\nSince the smallest book can't go at the end with the hole, it has 3 possible positions:\n*  Second from the left\n*  Second from the right\n*  In the middle\n**Step 3: Placing the Remaining Books**\nNow, let's consider the other three books. After placing the smallest book, we have 3 remaining spots.  The order we place these books matters:\n* For the first remaining spot, we have 3 choices.\n* For the second remaining spot, we have 2 choices left.\n* For the final spot, we only have 1 choice.\n**Step 4:  Calculating the Total Arrangements**\nTo find the total number of arrangements, we multiply the possibilities at each step:\n* **Smallest book positions:** 3 choices\n* **Book 2 positions:** 3 choices\n* **Book 3 positions:** 2 choices\n* **Book 4 positions:** 1 choice\nTotal arrangements: 3 * 3 * 2 * 1 = **18**\n**Therefore, Alex can arrange his books in 18 different ways while ensuring none of them fall through the hole.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n1. **The Smallest Book:**  The smallest book must be placed at either end of the shelf to avoid falling through the hole. This gives us two options for its placement.\n2. **The Remaining Books:**  Now we have three remaining books to arrange.  Since the order matters, we can arrange them in 3! (3 factorial) ways. 3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6.\n3. **Total Arrangements:**  To get the total number of ways to arrange the books, we multiply the number of choices for the smallest book by the number of ways to arrange the remaining books: 2 * 6 = 12.\n**Therefore, Alex can arrange his books in 12 different ways.** \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem:\n**1.  The Smallest Book:**\n* The smallest book must go in the position furthest from the hole, otherwise, it will fall.  This leaves only one possible spot for it.\n**2.  The Remaining Books:**\n* Now, we have three books left to arrange.\n* Since they are all different sizes, we have 3 choices for the first spot, 2 choices for the second spot, and 1 choice for the last spot. \n**3.  Calculating the Possibilities:**\n* The total number of ways to arrange the remaining books is 3 * 2 * 1 = 6.\n**4.  The Final Answer:**\n* Since the smallest book has only one possible position, and the other three books can be arranged in 6 ways, the total number of ways to arrange all four books is 1 * 6 = **6**.\n**Therefore, Alex can arrange his books in 6 different ways.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this step-by-step:\n**1.  The Smallest Book:**\n*  The smallest book *must* go in the first position to avoid falling through the hole. There's only **1** way to place it.\n**2. The Remaining Books:**\n*  Now we have 3 books left to arrange. \n*  For the second position, Alex has 3 choices.\n*  For the third position, he has 2 choices left.\n*  For the final position, there's only 1 choice left.\n**3. Total Arrangements:**\n* To find the total number of ways to arrange the remaining books, we multiply the number of choices for each position: 3 * 2 * 1 = 6\n**4. Overall Arrangements:**\n* Since the smallest book has only 1 placement option, and the remaining books have 6 arrangements, the total number of ways to arrange all four books is 1 * 6 = **6** \n**Therefore, Alex can arrange his books in 6 different ways to ensure none fall through the hole.** \n"
