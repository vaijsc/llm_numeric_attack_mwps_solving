    "solution": "Let $E_1$ be the expected winnings if a $\\heartsuit$ or $\\diamondsuit$ is drawn.  Since the probability that any particular rank is drawn is the same for any rank, the expected value is simply the average all the winnings for each rank, so \\[ E_1 = \\frac{1}{13}(\\$1+\\$2+\\cdots+\\$10+(3\\times\\$20)) = \\$\\frac{115}{13}. \\]Let $E_2$ be the expected winnings if a $\\clubsuit$ is drawn and $E_3$ the expected winnings if a $\\spadesuit$ is drawn.  Since drawing a $\\clubsuit$ doubles the winnings and drawing a $\\spadesuit$ triples the winnings, $E_2 = 2E_1$ and $E_3 = 3E_1$.  Since there is an equal chance drawing each of the suits, we can average their expected winnings to find the overall expected winnings.  Therefore the expected winnings are \\[ E = \\frac{1}{4}(E_1 + E_1 + E_2 + E_3) = \\frac{1}{4}(7E_1) = {\\$\\frac{805}{52}}, \\]or about $\\boxed{\\$15.48}$, which is the fair price to pay to play the game.",

        "Here's how to break down the problem to find the fair price:\n**1. Calculate the Expected Winnings for Each Card Type**\n* **Ace:**  1/13 chance of drawing an Ace, winning $1.  Expected value: (1/13) * $1 = $0.08\n* **2-10:** 9/13 chance of drawing a number card, with winnings ranging from $2 to $10.  We need the average winning value. The average of 2 through 10 is 6.  So, the expected value is (9/13) * $6 = $4.15\n* **Face Cards:** 3/13 chance of drawing a face card, winning $20.  Expected value: (3/13) * $20 = $4.62\n**2. Calculate the Expected Winnings for Each Suit**\n* **Clubs:** 1/4 chance of drawing a club, doubling the winnings. We need to consider the expected value of each card type multiplied by 2.\n    * Ace:  $0.08 * 2 = $0.16\n    * 2-10: $4.15 * 2 = $8.30\n    * Face Cards: $4.62 * 2 = $9.24\n* **Spades:** 1/4 chance of drawing a spade, tripling the winnings.\n    * Ace:  $0.08 * 3 = $0.24\n    * 2-10: $4.15 * 3 = $12.45\n    * Face Cards: $4.62 * 3 = $13.86\n* **Hearts and Diamonds:** 1/2 chance of drawing a heart or diamond, no change in winnings.\n**3. Calculate the Overall Expected Winnings**\nTo get the overall expected winnings, we need to consider the probability of each card type and suit:\n* Ace of Clubs: (1/13) * (1/4) * $0.16 = $0.003\n* Ace of Spades: (1/13) * (1/4) * $0.24 = $0.0046\n* Ace of Hearts/Diamonds: (1/13) * (1/2) * $0.08 = $0.003\n* 2-10 of Clubs: (9/13) * (1/4) * $8.30 = $1.45\n* 2-10 of Spades: (9/13) * (1/4) * $12.45 = $2.16\n* 2-10 of Hearts/Diamonds: (9/13) * (1/2) * $4.15 = $1.52\n* Face Card of Clubs: (3/13) * (1/4) * $9.24 = $0.53\n* Face Card of Spades: (3/13) * (1/4) * $13.86 = $0.80\n* Face Card of Hearts/Diamonds: (3/13) * (1/2) * $4.62 = $0.53\n**4. Add up all the Expected Winnings**\nTotal expected winnings = $0.003 + $0.0046 + $0.003 + $1.45 + $2.16 + $1.52 + $0.53 + $0.80 + $0.53 = **$6.99**\n**Therefore, a fair price to pay to play the game would be $6.99.** \n",
