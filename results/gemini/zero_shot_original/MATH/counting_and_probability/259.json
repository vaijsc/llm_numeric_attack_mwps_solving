    "solution": "There are $\\binom{12}{5}=792$ equally likely choices for the set of 5 CDs Carlos purchases.  Of these, $\\binom{9}{5}$ include no heavy metal CDs, $\\binom{8}{5}$ include no rap CDs, and $\\binom{7}{5}$ include no country CDs.  We can add these numbers to find the number of sets of CDs which do not include at least one CD from each category, except that we have counted the set of 5 country CDs twice, since it omits both heavy metal and rap.  Therefore,  \\[\n\\binom{9}{5}+\\binom{8}{5}+\\binom{7}{5}-1=126+56+21-1=202\n\\] of the sets of 5 CDs do not include at least one CD from each category.  Subtracting from 792, we find that 590 of the sets do include at least one CD from each category.  The probability that a chosen randomly set will be one of these is $\\dfrac{590}{792}=\\boxed{\\frac{295}{396}}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Calculate the total number of ways to choose 5 CDs:**\n* Carlos has 12 CDs and needs to choose 5. This is a combination problem.\n* The total number of ways to do this is  \u00b9\u00b2C\u2085 = (12!)/(5!7!) = 792\n**2. Calculate the number of ways to choose 5 CDs with at least one from each category:**\n* **Choose one rap CD:** There are \u2074C\u2081 = 4 ways to do this.\n* **Choose one country CD:** There are \u2075C\u2081 = 5 ways to do this.\n* **Choose one heavy metal CD:** There are \u00b3C\u2081 = 3 ways to do this.\n* **Choose the remaining CD:** We've already chosen 3 CDs, leaving 8 CDs to choose from.  We need one more, so there are \u2078C\u2081 = 8 ways to do this.\nTo get the total number of ways to choose 5 CDs with at least one from each category, we multiply these possibilities together: 4 * 5 * 3 * 8 = 480\n**3. Calculate the probability:**\n* Probability = (Favorable outcomes) / (Total possible outcomes)\n* Probability = 480 / 792 = **20/33** \n",
