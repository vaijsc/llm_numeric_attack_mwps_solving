    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are $3!=6$ possible three-digit integers.  So the fifth number on the list will be the second smallest.  The two smallest integers have $1$ as the hundreds digit.  The smallest is $135$; the second-smallest is $\\boxed{153}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n1. **Find the largest possible number:** The largest number you can form using 1, 3, and 5 is 531.\n2. **Find the next largest number:**  The next largest number is 513.\n3. **Continue finding the numbers in descending order:**  The list would continue as follows:\n    * 351\n    * 315 \n4. **The fifth number in the list:** The fifth number in this list is **153**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the largest possible integer:**\n* The largest digit (5) goes in the hundreds place. \n* The next largest (3) goes in the tens place.\n* The smallest (1) goes in the units place. \n* This gives us 531.\n**2. Find the next largest:**\n* To get the next largest number, we need to swap the digits in the tens and units place.\n* This gives us 513.\n**3. Continue the process:**\n*  The next largest number is 351 (swap the hundreds and tens places).\n*  The next is 315 (swap the tens and units places).\n**4. The fifth number:**\n* The fifth largest number is the one where we swap the hundreds and units place from the previous number (315).\n* This gives us **135**. \n**Therefore, the fifth largest integer is 135.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Find the largest possible number:**\n* The largest possible number is formed by arranging the digits in descending order: 531.\n**2.  Find the next largest number:**\n* To get the next largest, swap the last two digits: 513.\n**3.  Continue finding smaller numbers:**\n* Swap the first two digits: 351.\n* Swap the last two digits again: 315.\n**4.  The fifth largest number:**\n* The fifth largest number is **153**. \n**Therefore, the integer listed fifth is 153.** \n",
