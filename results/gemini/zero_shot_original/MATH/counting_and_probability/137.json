    "solution": "If Polya is never to visit the sixth floor after she begins, we know that her first stop is at the seventh floor. Moreover, her second stop must be at the eighth floor. She has three moves left, and the only way she can ever visit the 6th floor from the 8th floor in three remaining moves is to go down in both of the following two steps. The probability of getting to the eighth step in two moves is $\\frac{1}{2^2} = \\frac{1}{4}$. And the probability of not going downward in the next two steps is $1- \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}$. So the overall probability of never hitting the sixth floor after the beginning is $\\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{3}{4} = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{16}}.$",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Understanding the Constraints**\n* Polya starts on the 6th floor.\n* She wants all five stops to be on the 7th floor or higher.\n* Each coin flip determines whether she goes up or down.\n**2.  Possible Scenarios**\nTo ensure all stops are on the 7th floor or higher, she must never go down. This means all five coin flips must be heads.\n**3.  Calculating the Probability**\n* Each coin flip has a 1/2 chance of being heads.\n* Since the flips are independent, we multiply the probabilities of each individual flip to find the probability of getting heads five times in a row. \nTherefore, the probability is (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = **1/32**. \n",
        "Polya needs to flip at least four heads to end up on the $7^{\\mathrm{th}}$ floor or higher.  Here's why:\n* **Zero heads:** She goes down five floors, ending on the first floor.\n* **One head:** She goes down four floors, ending on the second floor.\n* **Two heads:** She goes down three floors, ending on the third floor.\n* **Three heads:** She goes down two floors, ending on the fourth floor.\nSo, she needs at least four heads. There are a few ways to get four or five heads:\n* **HHHHH:** This happens with probability $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^5 = \\frac{1}{32}$\n* **HHHHT:** This happens with probability $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^5 = \\frac{1}{32}$\n* **HHHTH:** This happens with probability $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^5 = \\frac{1}{32}$\n* **HHTHH:** This happens with probability $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^5 = \\frac{1}{32}$\n* **HTHHH:** This happens with probability $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^5 = \\frac{1}{32}$\n* **THHHH:** This happens with probability $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^5 = \\frac{1}{32}$\nAdding up all these probabilities, we get $\\frac{1}{32} + \\frac{1}{32} + \\frac{1}{32} + \\frac{1}{32} + \\frac{1}{32} + \\frac{1}{32} = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{16}}$. \n",
        "For Polya to be on the 7th floor or higher for all five stops, she needs to flip heads at least once.  This is the same as saying she can't flip five tails in a row.\nThe probability of flipping tails five times in a row is $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^5 = \\frac{1}{32}$.  Therefore, the probability of *not* flipping five tails in a row, and thus having each of her next five stops on the 7th floor or higher, is $1 - \\frac{1}{32} = \\boxed{\\frac{31}{32}}$. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n* **Understanding the Problem:** Polya needs to go up at least one floor from her starting point on the 6th floor.  To do this, she needs to flip at least one head.\n* **Finding the Probability of NOT Going Up:** The only way she doesn't go up is if she flips all tails. The probability of this is (1/2)^5 = 1/32.\n* **Finding the Probability of Going Up:** Since the probability of not going up is 1/32, the probability of going up (flipping at least one head) is 1 - (1/32) = 31/32.\n**Therefore, the probability that each of her next five stops is on the 7th floor or higher is  31/32.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Rules:**\n* Polya starts on the 6th floor.\n* Heads means going up one floor.\n* Tails means going down one floor.\n* We want the probability of all five stops being on the 7th floor or higher.\n**2.  Analyze the Possible Outcomes:**\nTo stay on the 7th floor or higher, Polya can't go down.  This means she needs to flip heads at least four times.  Let's analyze the possible coin flip outcomes:\n* **HHHHH:**  Goes up 5 floors (to the 11th floor) - Works!\n* **HHHHT:** Goes up 4 floors (to the 10th floor) - Works!\n* **HHHTH:** Goes up 4 floors (to the 10th floor) - Works!\n* **HHHTT:** Goes up 3 floors (to the 9th floor) - Works!\n* **HTHHH:** Goes up 4 floors (to the 10th floor) - Works!\n* **HTHHT:** Goes up 3 floors (to the 9th floor) - Works!\n* **HTHTH:** Goes up 2 floors (to the 8th floor) - Works!\n* **HTTHH:** Goes up 3 floors (to the 9th floor) - Works!\n* **THHHH:** Goes up 4 floors (to the 10th floor) - Works!\n* **THHHT:** Goes up 3 floors (to the 9th floor) - Works!\n* **THHTH:** Goes up 2 floors (to the 8th floor) - Works!\n* **THHTT:** Goes up 1 floor (to the 7th floor) - Works!\n**3. Calculate the Probability:**\n* There are 12 successful outcomes.\n* Each coin flip has 2 possible outcomes (heads or tails).\n* There are 5 coin flips, so there are a total of 2^5 = 32 possible outcomes.\nThe probability of Polya's next five stops being on the 7th floor or higher is **12/32 = 3/8**. \n"
