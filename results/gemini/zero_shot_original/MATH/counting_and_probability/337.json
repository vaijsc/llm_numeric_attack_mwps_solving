    "solution": "There are $\\binom{20}{2} = 190$ ways to choose two members of the group. There are $12$ ways to choose a boy and $8$ ways to choose a girl for a total of $12 \\cdot 8 = 96$ ways to choose a boy and a girl.  This means that there is a $\\dfrac{96}{190} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{48}{95}}$ chance that the two random members of the group are a boy and a girl.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Calculate the total number of ways to choose 2 members:**\n* There are 20 members, and we're choosing 2, so we use combinations:  \n   *  20C2 = (20!)/(2! * 18!) = 190\n**2. Calculate the number of ways to choose 1 boy and 1 girl:**\n* We need to choose 1 boy out of 12: 12C1 = 12\n* We need to choose 1 girl out of 8: 8C1 = 8\n**3. Calculate the probability:**\n* Probability = (Favorable Outcomes) / (Total Possible Outcomes)\n* Favorable Outcomes: 12C1 * 8C1 = 12 * 8 = 96\n* Total Possible Outcomes: 20C2 = 190\nTherefore, the probability of choosing one boy and one girl is 96/190, which simplifies to **48/95**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Possible Scenarios:**\n* **Scenario 1: Boy then Girl** -  We need the probability of choosing a boy first, then a girl.\n* **Scenario 2: Girl then Boy** - We need the probability of choosing a girl first, then a boy.\n**2. Calculate Probabilities:**\n* **Scenario 1 (Boy then Girl):**\n    * Probability of choosing a boy first: 12 (boys) / 20 (total members) = 3/5\n    * Probability of choosing a girl second (after taking out one boy): 8 (girls) / 19 (remaining members) = 8/19\n    * Probability of Scenario 1: (3/5) * (8/19) = 24/95\n* **Scenario 2 (Girl then Boy):**\n    * Probability of choosing a girl first: 8 (girls) / 20 (total members) = 2/5\n    * Probability of choosing a boy second (after taking out one girl): 12 (boys) / 19 (remaining members) = 12/19\n    * Probability of Scenario 2: (2/5) * (12/19) = 24/95\n**3. Total Probability:**\nSince either Scenario 1 or Scenario 2 satisfies the condition, we add the probabilities:\n* Total Probability = Probability of Scenario 1 + Probability of Scenario 2\n* Total Probability = 24/95 + 24/95 = 48/95\n**Therefore, the probability of choosing a boy and a girl is 48/95.** \n",

Calculate the probability of choosing a boy first.**\n* There are 12 boys and 20 total members.\n* The probability of choosing a boy first is 12/20.\n**2. Calculate the probability of choosing a girl second, given a boy was chosen first.**\n* Now there are only 19 members left.\n* There are still 8 girls left.\n* The probability of choosing a girl second is 8/19.\n**3. Multiply the probabilities to find the overall probability.**\n* The probability of choosing a boy then a girl is (12/20) * (8/19) = 48/380\n**4. Simplify the fraction (optional).**\n* 48/380 can be simplified to 12/95\n**Therefore, the probability of choosing a boy and a girl is 12/95.** \n",
