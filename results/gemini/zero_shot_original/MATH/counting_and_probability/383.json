    "solution": "There are $\\binom{52}{3} = 22,\\!100$ ways to choose 3 cards out of 52, without regard to order.  To choose two cards of matching rank, there are 13 different ranks and $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ combinations of suits to choose from, for a total of $13 \\times 6 = 78$ different possibilities.  There are 48 remaining cards not in the same rank as the first two.  This means there are $78 \\times 48 = 3,\\!744$ ways to choose a hand that is a pair.  So the probability that a randomly drawn hand is a pair is $\\dfrac{3744}{22100} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{72}{425}}$.",

        "Here's how to break down the probability calculation step-by-step:\n**1.  Calculate the total number of possible hands**\n* There are 52 cards to choose from for the first card.\n* There are 51 cards left for the second card.\n* There are 50 cards left for the third card.\nHowever, the order we choose the cards doesn't matter (6-8-6 is the same hand as 8-6-6).  So we need to divide by the number of ways to order 3 things (3! = 3*2*1 = 6).\n* Total possible hands: (52 * 51 * 50) / 6 = 22,100\n**2. Calculate the number of hands that are pairs**\n* **Choose the rank of the pair:**  There are 13 different ranks (Ace through King).\n* **Choose the two cards of that rank:**  There are 4 cards of each rank, and we need to choose 2 of them. This can be done in 4C2 ways, which is (4*3)/(2*1) = 6 ways.\n* **Choose the third card:**  This card must be a different rank than the pair, so there are 12 remaining ranks to choose from.  For each of these ranks, there are 4 possible cards.\n* Total number of pair hands: 13 ranks * 6 ways to choose the pair * 12 ranks * 4 cards = 3,744\n**3. Calculate the probability**\n* Probability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n* Probability of a pair = 3,744 / 22,100 = **approximately 0.169** \n**Therefore, the probability of getting a pair when drawing 3 cards from a standard deck is approximately 16.9%.** \n",

        "Here's how to break down the probability of getting a pair in a 3-card hand:\n**1.
