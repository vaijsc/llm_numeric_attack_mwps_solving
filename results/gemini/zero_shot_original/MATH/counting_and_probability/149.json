    "solution": "Consider one vertex of the cube. When the cube is rotated, there are 8 vertices which that vertex could end up at. At each of those vertices, there are 3 ways to rotate the cube onto itself with that vertex fixed. So, there are a total of $8\\cdot3=24$ ways to rotate a cube. There are $8!$ ways to arrange the beads, not considering rotations. Since the arrangements come in groups of 24 equivalent arrangements, the actual number of ways to arrange the beads is $8!/24=\\boxed{1680}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step by step:\n**1. Total Possible Arrangements:**\n* Imagine the cube as a blank canvas. You have 8 beads, and 8 places to put them.\n* For the first bead, you have 8 choices.\n* For the second bead, you have 7 choices left.\n* And so on, down to 1 choice for the last bead.\n* This gives us a total of 8! (8 factorial) = 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 40,320 possible arrangements.\n**2. Identifying Rotational Symmetries:**\n* **Rotations about a face:** You can rotate the cube 4 times by 90 degrees about any given face, resulting in 4 identical arrangements.\n* **Rotations about an edge:** You can rotate the cube 2 times by 180 degrees about any given edge, resulting in 2 identical arrangements.\n* **Rotations about a vertex:** You can rotate the cube 3 times by 120 degrees about any given vertex, resulting in 3 identical arrangements.\n**3. Counting Rotational Symmetries:**\n* **Face Rotations:** There are 6 faces on a cube, so there are 6 * 4 = 24 rotations about faces.\n* **Edge Rotations:** There are 12 edges on a cube, so there are 12 * 2 = 24 rotations about edges.\n* **Vertex Rotations:** There are 8 vertices on a cube, so there are 8 * 3 = 24 rotations about vertices.\n* **Total Rotations:**  24 + 24 + 24 = 72 rotations \n**4. Adjusting for Overcounting:**\n*  The 72 rotations we counted are not all unique. Some rotations are just different ways of getting to the same arrangement. \n*  We need to figure out how many distinct arrangements are represented by each set of rotations.  This takes some careful consideration, but it turns out each distinct arrangement is represented by 24 different rotations.\n**5. Final Calculation:**\n* We started with 40,320 possible arrangements.\n* Each arrangement is actually counted 24 times. \n* Therefore, the number of distinct arrangements (where rotations are considered the same) is 40,320 / 24 = **1680**.\n**Answer:** There are 1680 ways to put 8 beads of different colors on the vertices of a cube, if rotations of the cube (but not reflections) are considered the same. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding the Problem**\n* **Cube Rotations:** We're only concerned with rotations, not reflections. This means flipping the cube over is considered a different arrangement.\n* **Distinct Beads:** Each bead is a different color, so swapping their positions creates a different arrangement.\n**Steps to Solve**\n1. **Choose a Reference Point:** Pick any vertex on the cube as your starting point.  It doesn't matter which one you choose.\n2. **Place the First Bead:** There are 8 choices for which bead to place on the reference vertex.\n3. **Place the Second Bead:** Now move to an adjacent vertex. There are 3 choices for the bead to place there (since we've already used one).\n4. **Place the Third Bead:** Now, consider a vertex that shares an edge with both the first and second beads. There are 2 choices for this bead.\n5. **Place the Fourth Bead:**  Move to a vertex that shares a face with the first three beads. There's only 1 choice left for this bead.\n6. **Complete the Cube:** The remaining four beads can be placed in any order since rotations will make them equivalent.\n7. **Correct for Overcounting:** We've overcounted the number of arrangements because we've treated all the vertices as distinct. A cube has 8 vertices, but rotations make many of them equivalent.  There are 24 different rotations of a cube (this is a bit tricky to prove, but you can visualize it).\n**Calculation**\n* **Total Possible Arrangements:**  8 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 48\n* **Divide by Overcounting:** 48 / 24 = 2\n**Answer:** There are **2** distinct ways to place 8 different colored beads on the vertices of a cube, considering rotations. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\n* We have 8 distinct beads (colors).\n* We need to place them on the 8 vertices of a cube.\n* Rotations of the cube are considered the same arrangement.\n**2. Finding the Total Number of Arrangements**\n* Initially, we have 8 choices for the first vertex, then 7 choices for the second, and so on. \n* This gives us a total of 8! = 40,320 possible arrangements if we didn't care about rotations.\n**3. Accounting for Rotations**\n* **Symmetry:**  A cube has many symmetries (rotations).  Every arrangement can be obtained by rotating the cube in a certain way.  To avoid overcounting, we need to divide by the number of rotations that leave an arrangement unchanged.\n* **Types of Rotations:**\n    * **90-degree rotations:**  We can rotate the cube 90 degrees around any of its 3 axes (passing through the center of opposite faces).  There are 4 possible 90-degree rotations for each axis, making 12 total rotations.\n    * **180-degree rotations:**  We can rotate 180 degrees around any of the 3 axes, giving us 3 additional rotations.\n    * **120-degree rotations:**  We can rotate 120 degrees around any of the 4 diagonals of the cube, giving us 4 additional rotations.\n* **Counting Rotations:**\n    * **Face Rotations:** For each face, there are 4 rotations (90 degrees, 180 degrees, 270 degrees, and 360 degrees).\n    * **Edge Rotations:** For each edge, there are 2 rotations (180 degrees and 360 degrees).\n    * **Vertex Rotations:** For each vertex, there are 3 rotations (120 degrees, 240 degrees, and 360 degrees).\n**4. Finding the Number of Rotations that Leave an Arrangement Unchanged**\nLet's consider a few cases:\n* **All Beads Different:** If all 8 beads are different colors, any rotation that takes a vertex to a different position will change the arrangement. The only rotation that leaves the arrangement unchanged is the identity (no rotation).  Therefore, the number of rotations that leave an arrangement unchanged is 1.\n* **Beads with Some Repeating Colors:**  If we have repeating colors, the number of rotations that leave an arrangement unchanged will be greater than 1.  For example, if we have 4 beads of one color and 4 beads of another, any rotation that swaps beads of the same color will leave the arrangement unchanged.\n**5.  Calculating the Final Answer**\nSince we don't have any information about repeating colors, we assume all 8 beads are different.\nThe number of unique arrangements is:\n(Total number of arrangements) / (Number of rotations that leave an arrangement unchanged)\n= 40,320 / 1\n= **40,320**\n**Therefore, there are 40,320 ways to put 8 beads of different colors on the vertices of a cube if rotations are considered the same.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step by step:\n**1.  Understanding the Problem**\nWe have 8 distinct beads and a cube. We want to find how many ways we can place the beads on the cube's vertices, but we consider two arrangements the same if we can rotate the cube to make them look identical.\n**2.  Symmetry and Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem**\nThis problem involves symmetry. The key to solving it is the **Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem:**\n* **Orbit:** The set of all arrangements that can be obtained by rotating a given arrangement.\n* **Stabilizer:** The set of rotations that leave a given arrangement unchanged.\nThe theorem states:  **|Orbit| * |Stabilizer| = |Group|**\nWhere:\n* |Orbit| is the size of the orbit.\n* |Stabilizer| is the size of the stabilizer.\n* |Group| is the size of the group of rotations.\n**3.  Applying the Theorem**\n* **|Group|:** A cube has 24 rotations: \n    * 3 rotations by 90 degrees around each of the 4 axes through the center and opposite faces.\n    * 6 rotations by 180 degrees around each of the 6 axes through the center and opposite edges.\n    * 8 rotations by 120 degrees around each of the 4 axes through opposite vertices.\n    * 1 identity rotation (doing nothing).\n* **|Stabilizer|:**  The stabilizer of an arrangement will depend on the specific arrangement of beads.  However, it will be a subgroup of the rotation group.\n* **|Orbit|:**  This is what we want to find\u2014the number of distinct arrangements under rotations.\n**4.  Finding a Specific Stabilizer**\nLet's consider a specific arrangement to find the stabilizer size. For example, imagine we place beads of 4 different colors on the top face of the cube and 4 different colors on the bottom face.  \n* **Stabilizer:**  The only rotations that keep this arrangement unchanged are:\n    * The identity rotation.\n    * A 180-degree rotation about the axis passing through the centers of the top and bottom faces.\n    * Two 180-degree rotations about the axes passing through the midpoints of opposite edges on the top and bottom faces. \n    * Thus, the stabilizer for this arrangement has size 4.\n**5. Calculating the Number of Distinct Arrangements**\n* Using the Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem:\n    * |Orbit| * |Stabilizer| = |Group|\n    * |Orbit| * 4 = 24\n    * |Orbit| = 6\n* This means there are **6** distinct arrangements under rotations for the specific arrangement we chose.\n**6. Accounting for All Possible Arrangements**\n* Since we have 8 beads, we have 8! (8 factorial) ways to arrange them initially (8 choices for the first bead, 7 choices for the second, and so on).\n* To find the number of distinct arrangements under rotations, we need to divide the total number of arrangements by the size of the orbit for each arrangement: 8! / 6 = 20160\n**Answer:** There are **20,160** distinct ways to put 8 beads of different colors on the vertices of a cube if rotations are considered the same. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding the Problem**\nWe need to find the number of distinct arrangements of 8 beads on a cube's vertices, where rotating the cube doesn't change an arrangement.  \n**Steps**\n1. **Total Arrangements:** If there were no restrictions, we'd have 8 choices for the first bead, 7 for the second, and so on. This gives us a total of 8! (8 factorial) possible arrangements.\n2. **Counting Rotations:**  We need to figure out how many times each unique arrangement is counted in the 8! total.  A cube has 24 rotations (consider these groups):\n    * **Identity:**  One rotation does nothing.\n    * **90-degree rotations:**  There are 3 axes of rotation, and for each axis, 3 distinct 90-degree rotations.\n    * **180-degree rotations:**  There are 3 axes of rotation, and for each axis, one 180-degree rotation.\n    * **120-degree rotations:** There are 4 axes of rotation, and for each axis, 2 distinct 120-degree rotations. \n3. **Dividing to Correct for Overcounting:**  Since each distinct arrangement is counted 24 times in the initial 8!, we need to divide by 24 to get the correct number of unique arrangements.\n**Calculation**\nThe number of distinct ways to arrange 8 beads on a cube is:\n8! / 24 = 40,320 / 24 = **1680** \n"
