    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "We first place the non-math books. There are $4$ choices for the first book, $3$ choices for the second book, $2$ choices for the third book, and $1$ choice for the last book. Then we have to put the two math books between the four non-math books such that there is at least one non-math book between the two math books. We see there is a total of $5$ openings created by the four non-math books. So the first math book has $5$ choices, and the second math book has $4$ choices.\n\nSo the total number of ways the books can be placed is $4\\times3\\times2\\times1\\times5\\times 4 =\\boxed{480}.$",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Arrange the Non-Math Books:**\n* We have 4 non-math books.  \n* These can be arranged in 4! (4 factorial) ways, which is 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24 ways.\n**2. Create Spaces for the Math Books:**\n* Imagine the 4 non-math books arranged on the shelf. This creates 5 spaces where we can place the math books (including the ends of the shelf):\n   _  B  _  B  _  B  _  B  _ \n**3. Place the Math Books:**\n* We have 2 math books and 5 spaces. \n* We can choose 2 spaces out of 5 in \u2075C\u2082 ways, which is (5 * 4) / (2 * 1) = 10 ways.\n**4. Arrange the Math Books:**\n* Once we've chosen the spaces, we can arrange the 2 math books within those spaces in 2! (2 factorial) ways, which is 2 * 1 = 2 ways.\n**5. Total Arrangements:**\n* To get the total number of arrangements where the math books are not together, we multiply the possibilities from each step:\n   24 (arrange non-math) * 10 (choose spaces) * 2 (arrange math) = **480**\n**Therefore, there are 480 ways to stack the books so the math books are not next to each other.** \n",

Combine the Arrangements:**\n* To get the total number of arrangements where the math books aren't together, multiply the number of ways to arrange the non-math books by the number of ways to place the math books:\n   24 ways (non-math) * 10 ways (math) = **240 ways**\n**Therefore, there are 240 ways to stack the books so that the math books are not next to each other.** \n",

Multiply to Find the Total Arrangements**\n* To get the total number of arrangements where the math books are not together, multiply the number of ways to arrange the non-math books by the number of ways to place the math books:\n    24 ways (non-math) * 10 ways (math) = **240 ways**\n**Therefore, there are 240 ways to stack the books on the shelf so that the math books are not next to each other.** \n",
