    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are $20$ potential members that could be president. Once the president is chosen, there are $19$ that could be vice-president. Finally, once those two offices are filled, there are $18$ that could be treasurer. Thus, there are $20 \\cdot 19 \\cdot 18 = \\boxed{6840}$ ways in which the math club can select the officers.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n* **Step 1: Choosing the President**\n   * There are 20 members, so there are 20 different choices for who can be president.\n* **Step 2: Choosing the Vice-President**\n   * After choosing the president, there are only 19 members left. So, there are 19 different choices for vice-president.\n* **Step 3: Choosing the Treasurer**\n   * Now, there are 18 members remaining, so there are 18 different choices for treasurer.\n* **Step 4: Total Combinations**\n   * To find the total number of ways to choose the officers, we multiply the number of choices at each step: 20 * 19 * 18 = 6840\n**Therefore, there are 6840 different ways to select a president, vice-president, and treasurer from the math club.** \n",
