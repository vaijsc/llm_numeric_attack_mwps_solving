    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "In a four-digit palindrome, the first digit is the same as the last, and the second digit is the same as the third digit.  There are 9 options for the first/last digit (1 through 9 -- the first digit cannot be 0), and there are 10 options for the second/third digit (0 through 9).  This gives us $9 \\cdot 10 = \\boxed{90}$ four-digit palindromes.",

        "Here's how to find the total number of four-digit palindromes:\n**Understanding the Structure**\n* A four-digit palindrome has the form `ABBA`, where A and B represent digits.\n**Breaking it Down**\n1. **First Digit (A):**  We have 9 choices for the first digit (1 through 9, since it can't be zero).\n2. **Second Digit (B):** We have 10 choices for the second digit (0 through 9).\n**Calculating the Total**\nSince the first two digits determine the entire palindrome, the total number of four-digit palindromes is:\n9 choices for A * 10 choices for B = **90**\n**Therefore, there are 90 four-digit palindromes.** \n",
