        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Understand Diagonals**\n* A diagonal of a polygon is a line segment that connects two non-adjacent vertices.\n**2.  Count Potential Connections**\n* A five-sided polygon (pentagon) has 5 vertices.\n* Each vertex can be connected to 2 other vertices to form a diagonal. \n*  So initially, we might think there are 5 * 2 = 10 diagonals.\n**3.  Avoid Overcounting**\n*  We've overcounted the diagonals because we counted each diagonal twice (once for each endpoint). \n* For example, the diagonal connecting vertex 1 and vertex 3 was counted when we considered vertex 1 and again when we considered vertex 3.\n**4. Calculate Unique Diagonals**\n* To get the actual number of unique diagonals, divide the initial count by 2: 10 / 2 = 5\n**Answer:** There are **5** unique diagonals that can be drawn in a five-sided convex polygon. \n",

Understand Diagonals**\n* A diagonal is a line segment that connects two non-adjacent vertices of a polygon. \n**2.  Count Potential Connections**\n* In a pentagon, each vertex has 5 potential connections to other vertices (including itself). \n* However, we need to eliminate:\n    * **Connections to itself:** This leaves 4 potential connections per vertex.\n    * **Connections to its two adjacent vertices:** This leaves 2 potential connections per vertex.\n**3. Avoid Double Counting**\n* Since we're connecting vertices in pairs, we've double-counted each diagonal (e.g., connecting vertex A to vertex C is the same diagonal as connecting vertex C to vertex A).\n**4. Calculate**\n* Each vertex has 2 potential diagonals.\n* With 5 vertices, there are 5 * 2 = 10 potential diagonals.\n* We've double-counted, so we divide by 2: 10 / 2 = 5\n**Answer:** A five-sided convex polygon has **5** unique diagonals. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Understand Diagonals**\nA diagonal is a line segment that connects two non-adjacent vertices of a polygon.\n**2.  Count the Total Lines**\n* A pentagon has 5 vertices.\n*  From each vertex, you can draw lines to the other 4 vertices. \n*  This seems like 5 * 4 = 20 lines.\n**3.  Account for Overcounting**\n*  We've overcounted the sides of the pentagon.  Each side was counted twice (once from each endpoint).\n*  There are 5 sides. \n*  So, we need to subtract 5 from our count: 20 - 5 = 15\n**4.  Account for Overcounting Diagonals**\n* We've also overcounted each diagonal.  Each diagonal was counted twice (once from each endpoint). \n*  We need to divide our remaining count by 2: 15 / 2 = 7.5\n**5.  The Answer**\nSince we can't have half a diagonal, we round down. A pentagon has **5** unique diagonals. \n",
