    "problem": "A tribe of eight Native Americans sits in a circle around a campfire. If the chief must sit between his mother and his wife, how many different seating arrangements are possible? Two seating arrangements are considered the same if each individual has the same person to the right and the same person to the left in both.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "We first consider the possible neighbors of the chief's mother. One must be the chief (and the chief's wife sits on the other side of the chief), the other is one of the remaining 5 natives. That native can, in turn, have one of 4 neighbors in addition to the chief's mother. Continuing around, there are $5\\cdot4\\cdot3\\cdot2\\cdot1={120}$ possible arrangements.  The chief can be on his mother's left or right, for a total of $2\\cdot 120 = \\boxed{240}$ arrangements.\n\nAlternatively, we know that the seating arrangement is the same if it is rotated. Once the chief's spot is chosen, the rotations are eliminated.  There are 2 ways to seat his wife and his mother, and then there are 5 distinct positions for the remaining 5 natives, which makes for $2\\cdot 5!=\\boxed{240}$ possible arrangements.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Treat the Chief, Mother, and Wife as a Unit**\nSince the chief must sit between his mother and wife, we can consider them as a single unit. This unit has three members, and they can be arranged within the unit in 3! = 6 ways (chief-mother-wife, chief-wife-mother, etc.).\n**2. Arrange the Unit and the Remaining Individuals**\nNow we have 5 \"objects\" to arrange: \n* The chief-mother-wife unit\n* The remaining 5 tribe members\nThese 5 objects can be arranged in a circle in (5-1)! = 4! = 24 ways.\n**3. Combine the Possibilities**\nTo get the total number of seating arrangements, we multiply the possibilities from steps 1 and 2:\nTotal arrangements = 6 ways (for the unit) * 24 ways (for the arrangement of the unit and others) = **144 different seating arrangements** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Treat the Chief, Mother, and Wife as a Unit**\nSince the chief must sit between his mother and wife, we can consider them as a single unit.  Let's call this unit \"CMW\".\n**2. Arrange the Unit**\nWithin the unit \"CMW,\" the chief can be in the middle with either his mother or his wife on each side.  This gives us 2 possible arrangements:\n* **CMW** \n* **WMC** \n**3. Arrange the Remaining People**\nNow we have 5 remaining individuals to arrange around the campfire.  We can think of them as occupying 5 distinct positions.\n* The first position can be filled by any of the 5 remaining people.\n* The second position can then be filled by any of the remaining 4 people.\n* And so on...\n**4. Calculate the Total Arrangements**\nThe total number of ways to arrange the remaining 5 individuals is 5! (5 factorial), which is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.\n**5. Combine the Arrangements**\nFor each of the two possible arrangements of the \"CMW\" unit, there are 120 ways to arrange the remaining individuals.  Therefore, the total number of possible seating arrangements is:\n2 (arrangements of CMW) * 120 (arrangements of the rest) = **240**\n**Therefore, there are 240 different seating arrangements possible.** \n",

Arrange the Unit and the Remaining Individuals:**\n* Now we have 6 individuals (the unit and 5 other tribe members) to arrange in a circle.  \n* There are (6-1)! = 5! = 120 ways to arrange 6 distinct objects in a circle (we subtract 1 because rotations of the same arrangement are considered the same).\n**3. Combine the Possibilities:**\n* For each arrangement of the unit, there are 120 possible arrangements of the entire circle.\n* Therefore, the total number of seating arrangements is 6 * 120 = **720**. \n",

Treat the Chief, Mother, and Wife as a Unit**\nSince the chief must sit between his mother and wife, we can treat these three people as a single unit. This unit can be arranged in 3! = 6 ways (Chief-Mother-Wife, Chief-Wife-Mother, etc.).\n**2. Arrange the Unit and the Remaining People**\nNow we have 5 \"units\" to arrange: the chief's family unit and the 5 other individuals. These 5 units can be arranged in 5! = 120 ways.\n**3. Final Calculation**\nTo get the total number of possible seating arrangements, we multiply the number of ways to arrange the chief's family unit by the number of ways to arrange the remaining units:\n6 ways (for the family unit) * 120 ways (for all units) = **720 different seating arrangements** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Treat the Chief, Mother, and Wife as a Unit**\nSince the chief must sit between his mother and wife, we can consider them as a single unit for now.  This unit can be arranged in 3! = 6 ways (chief-mother-wife, chief-wife-mother, etc.).\n**2.  Arrange the Unit and the Remaining People**\nNow we have 5 entities to arrange: our chief-mother-wife unit and the remaining 5 tribe members. These can be arranged in 5! = 120 ways.\n**3.  Consider Rotations**\nSince it's a circular arrangement, any rotation of the same order of people is considered the same.  Therefore, we need to divide the number of arrangements by the number of possible rotations.  With 8 people, there are 8 possible rotations.\n**4.  Calculate the Final Number of Arrangements**\nPutting it all together, the total number of distinct seating arrangements is:\n(6 ways to arrange the unit) * (120 ways to arrange the unit and others) / (8 possible rotations) = 90\n**Therefore, there are 90 different seating arrangements possible.** \n"
