The $n$th row has $n+1$ elements.\n* **Elements:** Each element in Pascal's Triangle is the sum of the two elements directly above it (except for the edge elements, which are 1).\n* **Sum of Elements:**  The sum of the elements in the $n$th row of Pascal's Triangle is $2^n$.\n**Analyzing the Function f(n)**\nThe function $f(n)$ calculates the difference between the sum of the elements in the $n$th row and the sum of the elements in all the previous rows.  \n* **Sum of previous rows:** The sum of the elements in the first $n$ rows of Pascal's Triangle is $1 + 2 + 2^2 + \\dots + 2^n = 2^{n+1} - 1$.\n* **f(n) expression:** Therefore, we can express $f(n)$ as:\n   \\[f(n) = 2^n - (2^{n+1} - 1) = 1 - 2^n.\\]\n**Finding the Minimum Value**\nSince $2^n$ increases rapidly as $n$ grows, the value of $f(n) = 1 - 2^n$ becomes increasingly negative. \n* **Minimum Value:**  As $n$ gets larger than 2015, the value of $f(n)$ gets smaller (more negative).  The minimum value of $f(n)$ for $n \\ge 2015$ is achieved when $n$ is as large as possible.

        "Here's a step-by-step solution to find the minimum value of $f(n)$ for $n \\ge 2015$:\n**1. Understanding Pascal's Triangle and its Properties**\n* **Rows and Elements:** Each row of Pascal's Triangle starts and ends with 1. The elements in between are the sum of the two elements directly above them.\n* **Sum of a Row:** The sum of the elements in the $n$th row of Pascal's Triangle is $2^n$. This can be proven by induction or using the Binomial Theorem.\n**2. Expressing f(n) in terms of Row Sums**\nWe know that:\n* $f(n)$ is the sum of the elements in the $n$th row minus the sum of elements in all previous rows.\n* The sum of elements in the $n$th row is $2^n$.\n* The sum of elements in the first $n$ rows is $2^0 + 2^1 + ... + 2^n = 2^{n+1} - 1$. \nTherefore, we can express $f(n)$ as:\n$$f(n) = 2^n - (2^{n+1} - 1) = 1 - 2^n$$\n**3. Finding the Minimum Value**\nSince $n \\ge 2015$, the term $-2^n$ becomes increasingly negative as $n$ grows larger.  Therefore, the minimum value of $f(n)$ occurs when $n$ is as large as possible. \nSince there's no upper limit on $n$, we can let $n$ approach infinity.  As $n$ approaches infinity, $-2^n$ approaches negative infinity, and thus, the minimum value of $f(n)$ approaches **negative infinity**. \n**Conclusion**\nThe minimum value of $f(n)$ for $n \\ge 2015$ is **negative infinity**. \n",
