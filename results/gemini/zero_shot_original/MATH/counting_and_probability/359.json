        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Total Cubes:**\n* The cube has 6 x 6 x 6 = 216 unit cubes.\n**2. Cubes with No Painted Faces:**\n* These are the cubes completely in the interior of the larger cube.  Imagine removing the outer layer of cubes.  This leaves a 4 x 4 x 4 cube in the center, with 64 cubes.\n**3. Cubes with One Painted Face:**\n* These are the cubes on the edges of the larger cube, but not on the corners. Each edge has 4 cubes that fit this description.  There are 12 edges, so there are 12 x 4 = 48 cubes with one painted face.\n**4. Cubes with Two Painted Faces:**\n* These are the cubes on the faces of the larger cube, but not on the edges. Each face has 16 cubes (4 x 4) that fit this description. There are 6 faces, so there are 16 x 6 = 96 cubes with two painted faces.\n**5. Cubes with Three or More Painted Faces:**\n* These are the cubes on the corners of the larger cube. There are 8 corners.\n**6. Calculating the Fraction:**\n* We know there are 96 cubes with two painted faces.\n* The total number of cubes is 216.\n* The fraction of cubes with at least two painted faces is 96/216.\n**7. Simplifying the Fraction:**\n* Both 96 and 216 are divisible by 24.\n* 96/216 simplifies to **4/9**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Total Unit Cubes:**\n* A 6x6x6 cube has 6 * 6 * 6 = 216 unit cubes.\n**2. Cubes with No Painted Faces:**\n* The only cubes with no painted faces are the ones completely inside the big cube. \n* Imagine a smaller cube inside, 4x4x4. This smaller cube represents the cubes with no paint.\n* There are 4 * 4 * 4 = 64 cubes with no paint.\n**3. Cubes with One Painted Face:**\n* These are the cubes along the edges of the big cube, but not on the corners.\n* Each edge has 4 cubes with one painted face.\n* There are 12 edges in total.\n* So there are 12 * 4 = 48 cubes with one painted face.\n**4. Cubes with Two Painted Faces:**\n* These are the cubes on the faces of the big cube, but not on the edges or corners.\n* Each face has 16 cubes with two painted faces (a 4x4 square minus the 4 edge cubes).\n* There are 6 faces in total.\n* So there are 6 * 16 = 96 cubes with two painted faces.\n**5. Cubes with Three or More Painted Faces:**\n* These are the corner cubes, and they have three painted faces. \n* There are 8 corner cubes.\n**6. Calculating the Fraction:**\n* We're interested in the fraction of cubes with at least two painted faces.\n* That's the cubes with two painted faces plus the cubes with three painted faces. \n* So there are 96 + 8 = 104 cubes with at least two painted faces.\n* The fraction is then 104 / 216, which simplifies to **13/27**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1.  Visualize the Cube**\nImagine a 6x6x6 cube.  The only cubes that have at least two painted faces are the ones on the edges and the corners.\n**2. Count the Corner Cubes**\nThere are 8 corner cubes, and each has three painted faces.\n**3. Count the Edge Cubes**\n* Each edge has 4 cubes that are part of the edge but not corners (since we already counted the corners).\n* There are 12 edges on a cube.\n* So there are 4 cubes per edge * 12 edges = 48 edge cubes.  Each of these has two painted faces.\n**4. Total Cubes with At Least Two Painted Faces**\n* Corner cubes: 8\n* Edge cubes: 48\n* Total: 8 + 48 = 56 cubes\n**5. Total Number of Cubes**\n* The cube is 6x6x6 = 216 unit cubes.\n**6. Fraction of Cubes with At Least Two Painted Faces**\n* 56 (cubes with at least two painted faces) / 216 (total cubes) = **7/27** \n",
