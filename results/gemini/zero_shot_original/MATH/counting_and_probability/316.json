    "problem": "Matt and Ryan are playing an exciting round of Rock Paper Scissors: The Collectible Card Game. Matt is convinced that Rock can beat anything, so his deck consists only of 8 Rock cards.   Ryan's deck consists of 5 Paper cards and 3 Scissors cards.  In the game, Matt randomly selects 3 cards from his deck and places them on the table.  Ryan then randomly selects 3 cards and places one on each of Matt's cards.  If Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, and Paper beats Rock, then what's the probability that Ryan beats Matt in a landslide by choosing 3 Paper cards in a row?",

    "solution": "There are $\\binom{8}{3} = 56$ equally likely ways for Ryan to pick 3 of his 8 cards to play. There are are $\\binom{5}{3}=10$ ways for those 3 cards to be 3 of his 5 paper cards. So, the probability that he picks 3 paper cards  is $\\frac{\\text{successful outcomes}}{\\text{total equally-likely outcomes}} = \\frac{10}{56}=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{28}}$.",

        "Here's how we can break down the probability step-by-step:\n**1. Ryan's chances of drawing a Paper card:**\n* Ryan has 5 Paper cards in his deck of 8.\n* The probability of drawing a Paper card on the first draw is 5/8.\n**2. Ryan's chances of drawing another Paper card (given he already drew one):**\n* After drawing one Paper card, there are only 4 Paper cards left and 7 total cards.\n* The probability of drawing another Paper card is now 4/7.\n**3. Ryan's chances of drawing a third Paper card (given he drew two already):**\n* Now there are only 3 Paper cards left and 6 total cards.\n* The probability of drawing a third Paper card is 3/6.\n**4. The overall probability:**\nTo get the probability of Ryan drawing 3 Paper cards in a row, we multiply the probabilities of each individual draw:\n(5/8) * (4/7) * (3/6) = 5/56\n**Therefore, the probability of Ryan beating Matt in a landslide by choosing 3 Paper cards in a row is 5/56.** \n",

        "Here's how to break down the probability calculation:\n**1. Ryan's Chances of Drawing 3 Paper Cards:**\n* Ryan has 5 Paper cards in a deck of 8.\n* The probability of drawing a Paper card on the first draw is 5/8.\n* After drawing one Paper card, there are only 4 left and 7 cards total. So, the probability of drawing another Paper card is 4/7.\n*  Finally, the probability of drawing a third Paper card is 3/6 (or 1/2).\n**2. Calculating the Overall Probability:**\nTo find the probability of all three events happening, we multiply the individual probabilities:\n(5/8) * (4/7) * (1/2) = 5/28 \n**Therefore, the probability of Ryan beating Matt in a landslide by drawing three Paper cards in a row is 5/28.** \n",
