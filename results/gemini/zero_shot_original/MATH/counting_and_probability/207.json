    "solution": "There are two ways in which the ant can return to his original vertex: either he can go part of the way around the hexagon and then retrace his steps, or he can go all the way around the hexagon. In the first case, the ant necessarily moves an even number of steps, because his total number of steps is twice the number of steps needed to get to the point at which he begins to retrace. In the second case, because a hexagon has an even number of vertices, the ant is again moving an even number of steps. Thus, he has no way to return to the vertex on which he began in an odd number of steps, so the probability is $\\boxed{0}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding the Problem**\n* **Hexagon:**  A hexagon has six sides and six vertices (corners).\n* **Adjacent Vertex:** The ant can only move to a vertex that shares an edge with its current vertex.\n* **15 Steps:** The ant takes 15 moves.\n* **Probability:** We want to find the chance that the ant ends up back where it started.\n**Solution**\n1. **Possible Paths:** For each step, the ant has 2 choices (two adjacent vertices).  Therefore, over 15 steps, there are a total of 2^15 = 32,768 possible paths the ant could take.\n2. **Returning to the Start:** To end up back where it began, the ant's path must form a closed loop.  This means it needs to take an even number of steps in each direction. For example:\n   *  3 steps to the right, 3 steps to the left\n   * 5 steps forward, 5 steps backward\n3. **Counting Favorable Paths:**  Consider moving around the hexagon in a clockwise direction.  Let's say the ant takes \"x\" steps clockwise and \"y\" steps counterclockwise. To end up at the starting vertex:\n    * x + y = 15 (total number of steps)\n    * x - y = 0 (to return to the starting vertex, the net clockwise steps must be zero)\n    Solving these equations, we get x = y = 7.5.  This means the ant needs to take 7.5 steps clockwise and 7.5 steps counterclockwise.  Since we can't have half a step, there are **no** paths that will return the ant to its starting point after 15 steps.\n4. **Probability:** Since there are zero favorable paths and 32,768 total paths, the probability of the ant ending up back at the starting vertex after 15 steps is **0**. \n**Therefore, the probability is 0%.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding the Problem**\n* The ant is moving on a regular hexagon.\n* Each move takes him to a neighboring vertex.\n* We want to find the probability he ends up back at his starting point after 15 moves.\n**Key Idea**\nThe ant's movements form a cycle.  Here's why:\n* **Move 1:** The ant has 6 possible moves (to any of the adjacent vertices).\n* **Move 2:**  From his new position, he now has 5 possible moves (he can't go back to the vertex he just came from).\n* **Move 3:** He has 4 possible moves.\n* **... and so on.**\nNotice that after 6 moves, the ant *must* be back at his starting point.  Why?  Because there are no other vertices left to visit!\n**Cycles and Probability**\nThe ant's movement forms a 6-step cycle. To be back at the starting point after 15 steps, the ant needs to complete this 6-step cycle *exactly* 2 times (2 * 6 = 12 steps) and then take 3 more steps within the cycle.\n* **Probability of completing the 6-step cycle:** This is a certainty. Since the ant must return to the starting point after 6 moves, the probability of completing the cycle is 1.\n* **Probability of the final 3 steps:**  After the ant completes the cycle twice, there are 6 possible moves for the final 3 steps. Only one of these will lead him back to his starting point. So the probability of this is 1/6.\n**Final Calculation**\nThe overall probability is the product of the probabilities of each step:\n1 (probability of completing the 6-step cycle twice) * (1/6) (probability of the final 3 steps) = **1/6**\n**Therefore, the probability that the ant is standing on the same vertex on which he began after 15 steps is 1/6.** \n",

Since it takes 15 moves, there are 2^15 = 32,768 possible paths.\n2. **Favorable Paths:**  To end up back at its starting vertex, the ant's path must be a \"cycle\".  Consider the following:\n    * **1-Step Cycle:**  The ant moves to an adjacent vertex and then immediately back to its starting vertex.  This is a valid cycle. \n    * **2-Step Cycle:**  The ant moves to one adjacent vertex, then to another, and finally back to its starting vertex. This is also a valid cycle.\n    * **3-Step Cycle:**  The ant moves to an adjacent vertex, then to another, and finally back to its starting vertex (completing a cycle around the hexagon).\n    * **6-Step Cycle:** The ant moves around the hexagon completely, returning to its starting vertex.\n    Notice that cycles can only be 1, 2, 3, or 6 steps long. Any longer cycle will essentially repeat a shorter cycle.\n3. **Counting Favorable Paths:** \n    * **1-Step Cycle:**  There are 6 possible 1-step cycles (one for each vertex).\n    * **2-Step Cycle:** There are 6 possible 2-step cycles (one for each starting vertex).\n    * **3-Step Cycle:** There are 6 possible 3-step cycles.\n    * **6-Step Cycle:** There are 6 possible 6-step cycles.\n    To get 15 steps, we need combinations of these cycles:\n    * 15 1-step cycles\n    * 5 3-step cycles (and 5 1-step cycles)\n    * 2 3-step cycles, 3 2-step cycles (and 3 1-step cycles)\n    We need to count the number of ways to arrange these combinations. \n4. **Calculating the Probability:**\n   * **Combinations:** We can use combinations to count the arrangements.  For example, the number of ways to arrange 5 3-step cycles and 5 1-step cycles is (10 choose 5) = 252.\n   * **Total Favorable Paths:**  Add up the number of favorable paths for each combination of cycles.\n   * **Probability:**  Divide the number of favorable paths by the total number of possible paths (32,768).\n**The Calculation:**\nThe exact calculation gets a bit messy, but the concept is straightforward. You'll need to calculate the number of arrangements for each combination of cycles and add them together to get the total number of favorable paths. Then divide by 32,768.\n**Important Note:** The final probability will be quite low, as most 15-step paths won't end at the starting vertex. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding the Problem**\n* **Hexagon:** We're dealing with a six-sided shape.\n* **Adjacent Vertex:** The ant can only move to a corner (vertex) that shares an edge with its current position.\n* **15 Steps:** The ant takes 15 moves.\n* **Probability:** We want to find the chance the ant ends up back where it started.\n**Reasoning**\n1. **Possible Moves:** From each vertex, the ant has 2 possible moves.\n2. **Cycles:** To end up back where it started, the ant's moves must form a cycle.  A cycle is a sequence of moves that returns the ant to its starting position. \n3. **Cycle Lengths:**  The shortest cycle on a hexagon has a length of 6 (the ant visits all vertices).  Other cycles are multiples of 6 (12, 18, etc.).\n4. **15 Steps and Cycles:** Since 15 is not a multiple of 6, the ant cannot complete a full cycle in 15 steps.\n5. **No Return:**  Because the ant can't complete a cycle in 15 steps, it's impossible for it to end up back where it started.\n**Conclusion**\nThe probability that the ant ends up back on its starting vertex after 15 steps is **0**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding the Problem**\n* **The Hexagon:** Imagine a regular hexagon. Each vertex (corner) is connected to its two adjacent vertices by an edge.\n* **The Ant's Movement:** The ant can only move to a neighboring vertex in each step. \n* **The Goal:** We want to find the probability that after 15 steps, the ant ends up back where it started.\n**Solution**\n1. **Possible Moves:**  From any vertex, the ant has two possible moves (two adjacent vertices).\n2. **Cycles:** To return to the starting vertex, the ant needs to complete a cycle. There are two possible cycles:\n    * **Small Cycle:**  The ant moves to a neighboring vertex, then to the next neighboring vertex, and finally returns to the starting vertex (3 steps).\n    * **Large Cycle:** The ant moves around the entire hexagon, visiting all six vertices before returning to the start (6 steps).\n3. **Combinations:** The ant needs to take 15 steps.  To return to the starting vertex, it needs to complete a combination of small and large cycles. Since each cycle has a fixed number of steps, we need to find combinations of 3s and 6s that add up to 15.\n4. **Possible Combinations:**\n    * 5 small cycles: 3 steps * 5 = 15 steps\n    * 2 large cycles and 1 small cycle: 6 steps * 2 + 3 steps = 15 steps\n5. **Calculating Probability:**\n    * **Small Cycle:**  The ant has 2 choices for the first step (either direction), then 1 choice for the second step (must go to the other neighbor), and 1 choice for the third step (back to the start). This gives us a probability of 2/6 = 1/3 for a small cycle.\n    * **Large Cycle:**  The ant has 2 choices for the first step and then one choice for each of the remaining steps until it returns to the starting vertex. This also gives us a probability of 2/6 = 1/3 for a large cycle.\n6. **Final Probability:**  We need to calculate the probability of each combination:\n    * **5 small cycles:** (1/3)^5 = 1/243\n    * **2 large cycles and 1 small cycle:** (1/3)^2 * (1/3) = 1/27 \n7. **Total Probability:** We add the probabilities of the two possible combinations: (1/243) + (1/27) = **10/243**\n**Therefore, the probability that the ant is standing on the same vertex after 15 steps is 10/243.** \n"
