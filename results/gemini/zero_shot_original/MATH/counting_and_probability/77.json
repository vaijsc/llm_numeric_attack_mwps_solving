    "solution": "Of the digits 1 to 6, 5 must be the units digit since our number is a multiple of 5. We have five digits remaining, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6, for five digit places. The number is greater than 500,000 if and only if the hundred thousands digit is 6. The probability that the hundred thousands digit (which can be 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6) is 6 is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{5}}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step by step:\n**1. Multiples of 5:**\n* A number is divisible by 5 if its units digit is a 0 or a 5.\n**2. Favorable Outcomes:**\n* To be greater than 500,000, the number must start with a 5 or a 6.\n* If the number starts with 5, the units digit must be 0.\n* If the number starts with 6, the units digit must be 5.\n**3. Counting the Possibilities:**\n* **Case 1: Number starts with 5:**\n    * Units digit is fixed as 0.\n    * The remaining 4 digits can be arranged in 4! = 24 ways.\n* **Case 2: Number starts with 6:**\n    * Units digit is fixed as 5.\n    * The remaining 4 digits can be arranged in 4! = 24 ways.\n**4. Total Possible Outcomes:**\n* The first digit can be any of the 6 digits (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).\n* The remaining 5 digits can be arranged in 5! = 120 ways.\n**5. Probability:**\n* **Favorable outcomes:** 24 (Case 1) + 24 (Case 2) = 48\n* **Total possible outcomes:** 120\n* **Probability:** 48/120 = **1/2** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Multiples of 5**\n* A number is divisible by 5 if its units digit is a 0 or a 5.\n**2.  Possible Arrangements**\n*  We need to arrange the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.\n*  To be a multiple of 5, the units digit must be either 0 or 5. Since we don't have a 0, the units digit *must* be 5.\n*  This leaves us with 5! (5 factorial) ways to arrange the remaining 5 digits: 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120\n**3.  Numbers Greater than 500,000**\n* For the number to be greater than 500,000, the hundreds-thousands digit must be 5 or 6.\n* If the hundreds-thousands digit is 5, we have 4! (4 factorial) ways to arrange the remaining digits: 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24\n* If the hundreds-thousands digit is 6, we also have 4! = 24 ways to arrange the remaining digits.\n**4.  Calculate the Probability**\n* Total favorable outcomes (numbers greater than 500,000): 24 + 24 = 48\n* Total possible outcomes (multiples of 5): 120\n* Probability: (Favorable Outcomes) / (Total Outcomes) = 48/120 = **1/5** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understanding the Conditions:**\n* **Multiple of 5:**  A number is a multiple of 5 if its units digit is either 0 or 5.\n* **Greater than 500,000:**  The number must start with a 5 or a 6.\n**2. Finding the Total Number of Possibilities:**\n* **Units Digit:**  We have two choices for the units digit (0 or 5).\n* **Remaining Digits:**  We can arrange the remaining 5 digits in 5! = 120 ways. \n* **Total Possibilities:** 2 * 120 = 240\n**3. Finding the Favorable Number of Possibilities:**\n* **Starting with 5:** We have 5! = 120 ways to arrange the remaining digits.\n* **Starting with 6:** We have 5! = 120 ways to arrange the remaining digits.\n* **Favorable Possibilities:** 120 + 120 = 240\n**4. Calculating the Probability:**\n* **Probability:** (Favorable Possibilities) / (Total Possibilities) = 240 / 240 = **1**\n**Therefore, the probability that the number is greater than 500,000 is 1.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Determine the total number of possible arrangements:**\n* We have 6 digits to arrange, so there are 6! = 720 possible arrangements.\n**2. Determine the number of arrangements that are multiples of 5:**\n* A number is divisible by 5 if and only if its units digit is a 0 or a 5.\n* Since we only have the digits 1 through 6, the units digit must be a 5.\n*  We now have 5 remaining digits to arrange for the first five places, which can be done in 5! = 120 ways.\n**3. Determine the number of arrangements greater than 500,000:**\n* For the number to be greater than 500,000, the first digit must be a 5.\n* The remaining 5 digits can be arranged in 5! = 120 ways.\n**4. Calculate the probability:**\n* The probability of the number being greater than 500,000 is the number of favorable arrangements divided by the total number of arrangements. \n* This probability is (120 / 720) = **1/6**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Understanding the Conditions**\n* **Multiple of 5:**  The number must end in either 0 or 5.\n* **Six-digit number:** The number must have six digits, meaning the first digit can't be 0.\n* **Digits 1 to 6:** Each digit from 1 to 6 can only be used once.\n**2.  Counting Favorable Outcomes**\n* **Numbers ending in 0:**  We have 5 choices for the first digit (1, 2, 3, 4, 6), and then 4 choices for the second digit, and so on.  This gives us 5*4*3*2*1 = 120 ways to arrange the digits for numbers ending in 0.\n* **Numbers ending in 5:**  We have 4 choices for the first digit (we can't use 0 or 5), then 4 choices for the second digit, and so on. This gives us 4*4*3*2*1 = 96 ways to arrange the digits for numbers ending in 5.\n**3. Counting Total Outcomes**\n* **Total possible arrangements:**  We have 6 choices for the first digit, 5 for the second, and so on. This gives us 6*5*4*3*2*1 = 720 total possible six-digit numbers we can make using the digits 1 through 6.\n**4.  Calculating the Probability**\n* **Favorable outcomes:** We have 120 (numbers ending in 0) + 96 (numbers ending in 5) = 216 numbers greater than 500,000.\n* **Probability:** (Favorable outcomes) / (Total outcomes) = 216/720 = **3/10**\n**Therefore, the probability that the number is greater than 500,000 is 3/10.** \n"
