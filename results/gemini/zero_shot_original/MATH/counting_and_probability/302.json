    "solution": "There are nine possible products, as there are three different numbers upon which the first spinner could land and three different numbers upon which the second spinner could land. If the first spinner lands on $-3$ or $-1$, the second spinner can land on either 2 or 4 to create a negative product, giving four possibilities. If the first spinner lands on the 5, the second spinner must land on the $-6$ to create a negative product. Thus, there are five possible ways to create a negative product, so the probability that the product of the values is negative is $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{9}}$.",

        "The product of two numbers is negative if and only if one number is positive and the other is negative.  Let's consider the possible outcomes:\n* **Spinner 1 is -1:** The product is negative if Spinner 2 is 2 or 4.\n* **Spinner 1 is -3:** The product is negative if Spinner 2 is 2 or 4.\n* **Spinner 1 is 5:** The product is negative if Spinner 2 is -6.\nThere are 9 equally likely outcomes when spinning both spinners (3 possibilities for each spinner).  Of these, 5 result in a negative product.  Therefore, the probability is $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{9}}$. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1.  Identify the possibilities for a negative product:**\n   For the product of two numbers to be negative, one number must be positive and the other must be negative.\n**2.  Analyze the spinners:**\n   * **Spinner 1:** Has one positive value (5) and two negative values (-1 and -3).\n   * **Spinner 2:** Has one positive value (4), one negative value (-6), and one zero (2).\n**3.  Determine the favorable outcomes:**\n   To get a negative product, we need one spinner to land on a positive value and the other to land on a negative value.  There are these favorable outcomes:\n   * Spinner 1 lands on 5, and Spinner 2 lands on -6.\n   * Spinner 1 lands on -1 or -3, and Spinner 2 lands on 4.\n**4.  Calculate the total number of outcomes:**\n   Each spinner has 3 possible outcomes, so there are a total of 3 * 3 = 9 possible outcomes when both spinners are spun.\n**5.  Calculate the probability:**\n   There are 4 favorable outcomes (listed above) out of a total of 9 possible outcomes.  Therefore, the probability of the product being negative is **4/9**. \n",
        "The product of two numbers is negative if and only if one number is positive and the other is negative.  There are two cases where this happens:\n* The first spinner lands on a positive number (5) and the second spinner lands on a negative number (-6).\n* The first spinner lands on a negative number (-3 or -1) and the second spinner lands on a positive number (2 or 4).\nEach spinner has 3 equally likely outcomes, so there are $3\\cdot 3 = 9$ equally likely outcomes for the two spinners.  The probability of the first case is $\\frac{1}{3}\\cdot\\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{9}$.  The probability of the second case is $\\frac{2}{3}\\cdot\\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{4}{9}$.
