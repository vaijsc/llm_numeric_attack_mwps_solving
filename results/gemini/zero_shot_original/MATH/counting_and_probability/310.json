        "Here's how to determine the expected value of the sum of two eight-sided dice:\n**1. Possible Outcomes:**\n* Each die has 8 possible outcomes (numbers 1 through 8).\n* Since we're rolling two dice, the total number of possible combinations is 8 * 8 = 64.\n**2.  Calculating Probabilities and Expected Values:**\n* **Minimum Sum:** The smallest possible sum is 2 (1 + 1).  There's only one way to get this.\n* **Maximum Sum:** The largest possible sum is 16 (8 + 8).  There's only one way to get this.\n* **All Other Sums:**  Every sum in between 2 and 16 can be achieved in multiple ways.  For example, a sum of 5 can be achieved with (1+4), (2+3), (3+2), and (4+1).  We need to count these possibilities for each sum.\n**3.  Organization**\nTo make this easier, let's create a table to track the sums and their probabilities:\n| Sum | Ways to Achieve | Probability | Expected Value Contribution |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 2 | 1 | 1/64 | 2 * (1/64) = 1/32 |\n| 3 | 2 | 2/64 = 1/32 | 3 * (1/32) = 3/32 |\n| 4 | 3 | 3/64 | 4 * (3/64) = 3/16 |\n| 5 | 4 | 4/64 = 1/16 | 5 * (1/16) = 5/16 |\n| 6 | 5 | 5/64 | 6 * (5/64) = 15/32 |\n| 7 | 6 | 6/64 = 3/32 | 7 * (3/32) = 21/32 |\n| 8 | 7 | 7/64 | 8 * (7/64) = 7/8 |\n| 9 | 8 | 8/64 = 1/8 | 9 * (1/8) = 9/8 |\n| 10 | 7 | 7/64 | 10 * (7/64) = 35/32 |\n| 11 | 6 | 6/64 = 3/32 | 11 * (3/32) = 33/32 |\n| 12 | 5 | 5/64 | 12 * (5/64) = 15/16 |\n| 13 | 4 | 4/64 = 1/16 | 13 * (1/16) = 13/16 |\n| 14 | 3 | 3/64 | 14 * (3/64) = 21/32 |\n| 15 | 2 | 2/64 = 1/32 | 15 * (1/32) = 15/32 |\n| 16 | 1 | 1/64 | 16 * (1/64) = 1/4 |\n**4.  Expected Value**\nThe expected value (E) is the sum of the expected value contributions for each possible sum:\nE = (1/32) + (3/32) + (3/16) + (5/16) + (15/32) + (21/32) + (7/8) + (9/8) + (35/32) + (33/32) + (15/16) + (13/16) + (21/32) + (15/32) + (1/4) \nE = **9**\n**Therefore, the expected value of the sum of the rolls of two fair eight-sided dice is 9.** \n",

Possible Outcomes:**\n* Each die has 8 possible outcomes.\n* The sum of two dice can range from 2 (1 + 1) to 16 (8 + 8).\n**2.

Expected Value Formula:**\nThe expected value (E) is calculated as follows:\nE = (Sum of (Outcome * Probability of Outcome))\n**4.  Calculation:**\nLet's organize the calculations in a table:\n| Sum | Number of Possibilities | Probability | Sum * Probability |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 2 | 1 | 1/64 | 2/64 |\n| 3 | 2 | 2/64 | 6/64 |\n| 4 | 3 | 3/64 | 12/64 |\n| 5 | 4 | 4/64 | 20/64 |\n| 6 | 5 | 5/64 | 30/64 |\n| 7 | 6 | 6/64 | 42/64 |\n| 8 | 7 | 7/64 | 56/64 |\n| 9 | 8 | 8/64 | 72/64 |\n| 10 | 7 | 7/64 | 70/64 |\n| 11 | 6 | 6/64 | 66/64 |\n| 12 | 5 | 5/64 | 60/64 |\n| 13 | 4 | 4/64 | 52/64 |\n| 14 | 3 | 3/64 | 42/64 |\n| 15 | 2 | 2/64 | 30/64 |\n| 16 | 1 | 1/64 | 16/64 |\n**5.

        "Here's how to calculate the expected value of the sum of two eight-sided dice:\n**1.  Understanding Expected Value**\n* **Expected value** represents the average outcome you'd expect over many trials. \n* It's calculated by:  \n    *  Summing the product of each possible outcome and its probability.\n**2.  Possible Outcomes**\n* The minimum sum you can get is 2 (1 + 1).\n* The maximum sum you can get is 16 (8 + 8).\n* There are many sums in between.\n**3.  Calculating Probabilities**\n* **Think about a grid:** Imagine a grid where the rows represent the outcome of the first die and the columns represent the outcome of the second die. Each cell in the grid represents a possible outcome (the sum of the two dice).\n* **Count the favorable outcomes:** For each possible sum, count how many cells in the grid add up to that sum. For example, to get a sum of 3, there are two possibilities: (1, 2) and (2, 1).\n* **Calculate probability:** The probability of each sum is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes (64, since there are 8 possibilities for each die).\n**4.  Summing the Products**\n* For each possible sum, multiply the sum by its probability.\n* Add all these products together.\n**Here's a simplified way to think about it:**\n* The expected value of a single eight-sided die is (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8) / 8 = 4.5\n* Since the two dice are independent, the expected value of the sum is simply the sum of the expected values of each individual die: 4.5 + 4.5 = 9.\n**Therefore, the expected value of the sum of the rolls of two eight-sided dice is 9.** \n",
        "Here's how to calculate the expected value step-by-step:\n**1.  Possible Outcomes:**\n* Each die has 8 possible outcomes (1 to 8).\n* With two dice, there are 8 * 8 = 64 total possible outcomes.\n**2.  Sum of Each Outcome:**\n*  The minimum sum is 2 (1 + 1).\n*  The maximum sum is 16 (8 + 8).\n**3.  Probability of Each Sum:**\n* To find the probability of each sum, we need to count how many combinations of rolls result in that sum. \n* For example:\n    * **Sum of 2:** Only one combination: (1, 1)\n    * **Sum of 3:** Two combinations: (1, 2) and (2, 1)\n    * **Sum of 4:** Three combinations: (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1)\n    *  ...and so on.\n* You can create a table to list all the combinations and their corresponding sums.\n**4.  Expected Value Calculation:**\n* Expected value is calculated as the sum of (each outcome * its probability).\n* For each possible sum:\n    * Multiply the sum by its probability (number of combinations that result in that sum / total possible outcomes).\n    * Add these values together for all possible sums.\n**5.  Simplified Calculation:**\n* Due to symmetry, the expected value of the sum of two fair dice is the same as the expected value of a single die multiplied by 2.\n* The expected value of a single eight-sided die is (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8) / 8 = 4.5.\n**Therefore, the expected value of the sum of the rolls of two eight-sided dice is 4.5 * 2 = 9.** \n"
