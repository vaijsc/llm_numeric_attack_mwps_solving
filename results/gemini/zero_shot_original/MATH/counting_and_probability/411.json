    "solution": "There are $\\binom{52}{3} = 22,\\!100$ ways to choose 3 cards out of 52, without regard to order. For any suit, there are 12 possible triples of consecutive cards (since the three consecutive cards can start on an A, 2, 3, ..., or Q, but not on a K). Since there are 4 suits, there are $4\\cdot12=48$ valid triples. The chance that three cards chosen randomly are three consecutive cards of the same suit is therefore $\\frac{48}{22,\\!100}=\\boxed{\\frac{12}{5,\\!525}}$",

        "Here's how to break down the solution step-by-step:\n**1.  Favorable Outcomes**\n* **Identify the possible \"runs\" within a suit:**  There are 12 possible runs of three consecutive cards within each suit:\n    * 2-3-4, 3-4-5, 4-5-6, 5-6-7, 6-7-8, 7-8-9, 8-9-10, 9-10-J, 10-J-Q, J-Q-K, Q-K-A, A-2-3\n* **Count the total possible runs:** Since there are four suits, there are 12 runs per suit * 4 suits = 48 total possible runs.\n**2. Total Possible Outcomes**\n* **Choosing 3 cards from 52:** The total number of ways to choose 3 cards from a deck of 52 is given by the combination formula: \u2075\u00b2C\u2083 = (52!)/(3! * 49!) = 22100\n**3. Calculate the Probability**\n* **Probability = (Favorable Outcomes) / (Total Possible Outcomes)**\n* Probability = 48 / 22100 \n* Probability \u2248 0.00217\n**Therefore, the probability of drawing three cards that can be arranged into a group of three consecutive cards, all of the same suit, is approximately 0.217%.** \n",

Once the starting card is chosen, the next two cards are determined.  \n**2. Total Possible Outcomes**\n* **Choosing 3 Cards:**  There are 52 cards, and we're choosing 3, so the total number of combinations is  \u2075\u00b2C\u2083 = (52 * 51 * 50) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 22,100\n**3.

Choosing a Suit:**\n* There are 4 suits (hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades).\n**3.  Choosing the First Card:**\n*  Once we've chosen a suit and a group of consecutive cards, we need to pick the first card in that group.  There's only one way to do this.\n**4.
