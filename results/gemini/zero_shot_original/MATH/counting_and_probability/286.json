        "**Understanding the Binomial Coefficient:**\nThe binomial coefficient $\\binom{n}{k}$ represents the number of ways to choose a subset of $k$ elements from a set of $n$ elements. It's calculated as:\n$$\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$$\n**Applying to the Case of $\\binom{n}{n}$:**\nWhen $k = n$, the formula becomes:\n$$\\binom{n}{n} = \\frac{n!}{n!(n-n)!} = \\frac{n!}{n!0!}$$\n**Understanding 0!**\nBy definition, 0! (zero factorial) equals 1.\n**Simplifying the Expression:**\nNow we have:\n$$\\binom{n}{n} = \\frac{n!}{n!1} = \\frac{n!}{n!} = \\boxed{1}$$\n**Conclusion:**\nFor any positive integer $n$, $\\binom{n}{n}$ is always equal to 1. This makes sense because there's only one way to choose all $n$ elements from a set of $n$ elements. \n",
        "**Step 1: Understand the notation**\nThe notation $\\binom{n}{k}$ represents the binomial coefficient, which calculates the number of ways to choose *k* objects from a set of *n* distinct objects. \n**Step 2: Apply the formula**\nThe formula for the binomial coefficient is:\n$$\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$$\n**Step 3: Substitute n for k**\nIn our case, we need to find $\\binom{n}{n}$. Substituting *n* for *k* in the formula:\n$$\\binom{n}{n} = \\frac{n!}{n!(n-n)!}$$\n**Step 4: Simplify the expression**\n*  n - n = 0\n*  0! = 1 (by definition)\nTherefore:\n$$\\binom{n}{n} = \\frac{n!}{n! \\cdot 1} = \\frac{n!}{n!} = \\boxed{1}$$\n**Conclusion:** For any positive integer *n*,  $\\binom{n}{n}$ is always equal to 1. This makes sense because there's only one way to choose all *n* objects from a set of *n* objects - you simply choose them all. \n",
