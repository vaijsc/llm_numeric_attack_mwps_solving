    "solution": "The row that starts 1, 11 is the row $\\binom{11}{0}, \\binom{11}{1}, \\binom{11}{2},\\cdots$.  The $k^\\text{th}$ number in this row is $\\binom{11}{k-1}$.  (Make sure you see why it's $k-1$ rather than $k$ on the bottom.)  Therefore, the $9^\\text{th}$ number is $\\binom{11}{8}$.  We have  \\[\\binom{11}{8} = \\binom{11}{11-8} = \\binom{11}{3} = \\frac{11\\cdot 10 \\cdot 9}{3\\cdot 2 \\cdot 1} = \\boxed{165}.\\]",

        "Here's how to find the ninth number in the row of Pascal's triangle that starts 1, 11:\n**Understanding Pascal's Triangle**\n* **Rows:** Each row in Pascal's Triangle is numbered starting with row 0.\n* **Numbers:**  Each number in a row is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. The triangle starts and ends with 1 in each row.\n**Finding the Row**\n* The row that starts 1, 11 is row 11 (remembering rows start at 0). \n**Finding the Ninth Number**\n* Since the first number in the row is the 0th element, the ninth number is the 8th element.\n**Calculating the 8th Element**\nTo find the 8th element in row 11, we need to use the combination formula:\n* **nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)** \nWhere:\n* n = the row number (11 in this case)\n* r = the element position (8 in this case)\n**Calculation**\n1. **11!/(8! * (11-8)!)** = 11! / (8! * 3!)\n2. **(11 * 10 * 9 * 8!)/(8! * (3 * 2 * 1))** = (11 * 10 * 9) / (3 * 2)\n3. **990/6 = 165**\n**Therefore, the ninth number in the row of Pascal's triangle that starts 1, 11 is 165.** \n",
