        "Here's how to break down the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Understanding the Basics**\n* **Standard Deck:** A standard deck has 52 cards.\n* **Face Cards:** There are 12 face cards (3 per suit: Jack, Queen, King).\n**2. Probability of the First Card**\n* The probability of drawing a face card on the first draw is 12 (favorable outcomes) out of 52 (total outcomes): 12/52 = 3/13.\n**3. Probability of the Second Card**\n* **Important:** After the first card is drawn, there are only 51 cards left in the deck. Since we're looking for two face cards, we also need to consider that one face card is already gone.  This means there are only 11 face cards left.\n* The probability of drawing another face card on the second draw is 11/51.\n**4. Combined Probability**\n* To get the probability of both events happening, we multiply the individual probabilities:\n   (3/13) * (11/51) = 33/663\n**5. Simplifying**\n* The probability can be simplified to **11/221**. \n**Therefore, the probability of drawing two face cards in a row from a standard deck is 11/221.** \n",

Calculate the probability of the first card being a face card:**\n* The probability of drawing a face card on the first draw is 12/52 (favorable outcomes / total outcomes).\n**3.  Consider the second card:**\n* After drawing one face card, there are only 11 face cards left.\n* There are also only 51 cards remaining in the deck.\n**4.

Simplify the result:**\n* The probability can be simplified to approximately 0.0498 or about a 4.98% chance. \n**Therefore, the probability of drawing two face cards in a row from a standard deck is approximately 4.98%.** \n"
