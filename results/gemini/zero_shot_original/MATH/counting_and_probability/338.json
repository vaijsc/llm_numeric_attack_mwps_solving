    "problem": "I coach a soccer team with 15 members.  I want to choose a starting lineup consisting of 11 players, two of whom will represent the team in the captains meeting at the beginning of the game.  In how many ways can I choose my starting lineup, including designating the two captains?",

    "solution": "There are $\\binom{15}{2}=105$ ways to select the 2 captains from among the 15 players on the team. We then need to choose the remaining 9 starters from among the remaining 13 players, which can be done in $\\binom{13}{9}=715$ ways. This gives us a total of $\\binom{15}{2}\\cdot\\binom{13}{9}=105\\cdot715=\\boxed{75,\\!075}$ ways.",

        "Here's how we can break down the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Choosing the Starting Lineup:**\n* We have 15 players and need to choose 11. This is a combination problem (order doesn't matter) and can be calculated using the formula:  \u00b9\u2075C\u2081\u2081 = 15! / (11! * 4!) = 1365\n**2. Choosing the Captains:**\n* After choosing the starting lineup, we have 11 players.  We need to pick 2 of them to be captains.  Again, this is a combination: \u00b9\u00b9C\u2082 = 11! / (2! * 9!) = 55\n**3. Combining the Choices**\n* For each possible starting lineup, we have 55 ways to choose the captains.  To find the total number of ways to choose the lineup and captains, we multiply the possibilities:\n1365 (starting lineups) * 55 (captain choices) = **75,075**\n**Therefore, there are 75,075 ways to choose a starting lineup and designate two captains for your soccer team.** \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Choosing the Starting Lineup**\n* We have 15 players and need to choose 11 for the starting lineup.\n* This is a combination problem, as the order we choose the players doesn't matter.\n* The formula for combinations is: nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!) \n* Where:\n    * n = total number of items (15 players)\n    * r = number of items to choose (11 players)\n* So, the number of ways to choose the starting lineup is: 15C11 = 15! / (11! * 4!) = 1365\n**2. Choosing the Captains**\n* We've already selected 11 players for the starting lineup.\n* Now we need to choose 2 of them to be captains.\n* This is another combination problem: 11C2 = 11! / (2! * 9!) = 55\n**3. Combining the Choices**\n* To get the total number of ways to choose the starting lineup and designate the captains, we need to multiply the number of possibilities for each step.\n* Total ways = Number of ways to choose starting lineup * Number of ways to choose captains\n* Total ways = 1365 * 55 = **75075**\n**Therefore, there are 75,075 ways to choose the starting lineup and designate the two captains.** \n",
