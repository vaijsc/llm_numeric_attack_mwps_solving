    "problem": "In how many ways can we seat 6 people at a round table if John and Sam insist on sitting next to each other? (Two seatings are equivalent if one is a rotation of the other.)",

    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "To take care of rotations, we can fix John at the topmost seat.  We then have two choices for Sam: either side of John. The other four may sit anywhere in the other four seats. Thus there are $2\\times 4! = \\boxed{48}$ ways.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Treat John and Sam as a unit:**\nSince John and Sam must sit together, consider them as a single unit. Now we have 5 units to arrange: the combined John-Sam unit and the other 4 individuals.\n**2. Arrange the units:**\n* There are 4! (4 factorial) ways to arrange these 5 units around the circular table. However, since rotations are considered the same arrangement, we need to divide by 5 to avoid overcounting.\n* So, there are 4!/5 = 3! = 6 ways to arrange the units.\n**3. Arrange John and Sam within their unit:**\n* John and Sam can switch places within their unit. There are 2! = 2 ways to arrange them.\n**4. Calculate the total number of arrangements:**\nMultiply the number of ways to arrange the units by the number of ways to arrange John and Sam within their unit:\n6 ways (for units) * 2 ways (for John and Sam) = **12 ways**\n**Therefore, there are 12 ways to seat 6 people at a round table if John and Sam insist on sitting next to each other.** \n",

Now we have 5 entities to arrange:\n* The John-Sam unit\n* 4 other people\n**2. Arrange the Units**\n* There are 4! = 24 ways to arrange these 5 entities around the circular table.  (Remember, with circular arrangements, we fix one person's position to avoid overcounting rotations as different arrangements.)\n**3. Arrange John and Sam**\n* Within the John-Sam unit, there are 2! = 2 ways to arrange them (John-Sam or Sam-John).\n**4. Calculate Total Arrangements**\nTo get the total number of arrangements, multiply the number of arrangements of the units by the number of arrangements within the John-Sam unit:\n24 * 2 = **48**\n**Therefore, there are 48 ways to seat 6 people at a round table if John and Sam insist on sitting next to each other.** \n",

The number of ways to arrange *n* distinct objects in a circle is (n-1)!.  Therefore, we can arrange the 5 units in (5-1)! = 4! = 24 ways.\n**3. Arrange John and Sam within their unit:**\nJohn and Sam can switch places within their unit. They can sit as John-Sam or Sam-John.  This gives us 2 possibilities for each arrangement of the units.\n**4.
