        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Calculate the factorials:**\n*  6! = 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720\n*  4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24\n*  5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120\n**2. Substitute the factorials into the expression:**\n  (6! + 4!)/5! = (720 + 24)/120\n**3. Simplify the numerator:**\n  (720 + 24)/120 = 744/120\n**4. Divide the numerator by the denominator:**\n  744/120 = 6.2\n**5. Express as a mixed number:**\n  6.2 = **6 1/5** \nTherefore,  (6! + 4!)/5! expressed as a mixed number is **6 1/5**. \n",

Substitute the values into the expression:**\n   (6! + 4!) / 5! = (720 + 24) / 120\n**3. Simplify the expression:**\n   (720 + 24) / 120 = 744 / 120\n**4. Divide to get a mixed number:**\n   744 / 120 = 6 with a remainder of 24\n**5. Express the remainder as a fraction:**\n   The remainder (24) becomes the numerator, and the original denominator (120) stays the same: 24/120\n**6. Simplify the fraction:**\n   24/120 simplifies to 1/5\n**Final Answer:**  Therefore,  (6! + 4!) / 5!  expressed as a mixed number is **6 1/5**. \n",
