    "solution": "Since Meena has 9 points already, the only way Bob can win is by getting a point on both of the next two turns. The probability that this will happen is $\\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right) ^2=\\frac{1}{9}$. Therefore, the probability that Meena will win is $1-\\frac{1}{9}=\\boxed{\\frac{8}{9}}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Meena needs only 1 more point to win.**\n**2.  Consider the possible scenarios:**\n* **Scenario 1: Bob gets a point.**  This happens with probability 1/3.  If this happens, Meena loses and the game continues.\n* **Scenario 2: Meena gets a point.** This happens with probability 2/3 (since Bob doesn't get a point).  If this happens, Meena wins the game.\n**3.  If the game continues (Scenario 1), we're back to the starting point.**  Meena is still 1 point away from winning. \n**4.  Let 'P' be the probability that Meena will win.**\n* The probability of Meena winning immediately (Scenario 2) is 2/3.\n* The probability of the game continuing (Scenario 1) is 1/3.  If the game continues, the probability of Meena winning is still 'P'.\n**5.  We can express the probability of Meena winning as a recursive equation:**\nP = (2/3) + (1/3) * P\n**6.  Solve for P:**\n* Subtract (1/3)P from both sides: (2/3)P = 2/3\n* Divide both sides by (2/3): P = **1**\n**Therefore, the probability that Meena will win is 1 (or 1/1).** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding the Game**\n* The game ends when one player reaches 10 points.\n* Bob has a 1/3 chance of getting a point on each turn.\n* If Bob doesn't get a point, Meena gets a point.\n**Meena's Advantage**\nMeena is currently ahead 9 to 8, meaning she needs only 1 more point to win.\n**Scenarios**\n* **Meena wins on her next turn:**  This happens if Bob fails to get a point. The probability of this is 2/3 (since he has a 1/3 chance of getting a point).\n* **Meena wins on a later turn:** This happens if Bob gets a point, but then Meena wins on her subsequent turn. The probability of this sequence is (1/3)*(2/3) = 2/9. This pattern continues for each additional turn where Bob gets a point.\n**Calculating the Probability**\nWe can express the probability of Meena winning as an infinite geometric series:\n* 2/3 + (2/9) + (2/27) + ...\nThe first term is 2/3 and the common ratio is 1/3. The formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series is:\n*  a / (1 - r)  where 'a' is the first term and 'r' is the common ratio.\nPlugging in our values:\n* (2/3) / (1 - 1/3) = (2/3) / (2/3) = **1**\n**Answer**\nThe probability that Meena will win is **1**.  Meena is guaranteed to win the game. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1.  Focus on Meena's Winning Condition**\nMeena needs to gain just *one* more point to win.  \n**2. Consider the Possible Outcomes**\n* **Bob gets a point:** This happens with probability 1/3. If this happens, Meena needs to win on her next turn.\n* **Meena gets a point:** This happens with probability 2/3. This is a win for Meena.\n**3.  Set up the Recursion**\nLet  'P' be the probability that Meena wins the game. We can set up a recursive equation:\nP = (1/3) * (probability Meena wins after Bob gets a point) + (2/3) * (probability Meena wins after she gets a point)\nSince Meena wins immediately if she gets a point, the second term is simply 1.  Let's denote the probability Meena wins after Bob gets a point as 'Q'.\nSo our equation becomes:\nP = (1/3) * Q + (2/3)\n**4.  Solve for Q**\nNow we need to figure out 'Q', the probability Meena wins if Bob gets a point. This situation is essentially the same as the starting situation, except the score is now 9 to 9. So, the probability of Meena winning from this point (Q) is the same as the probability of Meena winning the game from the beginning (P). \nTherefore, Q = P\n**5.  Solve for P**\nSubstitute Q = P back into our original equation:\nP = (1/3) * P + (2/3)\nSolving for P:\n(2/3)P = (2/3)\nP = **1**\n**Answer:** The probability that Meena will win is **1**.  Meena is guaranteed to win the game. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Understand the Win Condition:**\nMeena needs just one more point to win (9 + 1 = 10).  Bob needs two points (8 + 2 = 10).\n**2.  Analyze Possible Scenarios:**\n* **Meena wins on the next turn:**  This happens if Bob fails to get a point.  The probability of this is 2/3 (since he has a 1/3 chance of getting a point).\n* **Bob gets a point, Meena wins on the following turn:** This happens if Bob gets a point, then fails to get a point on his next turn. The probability of this is (1/3) * (2/3) = 2/9.\n* **Bob gets two points in a row:** This would mean Bob wins. \n**3.  Calculate the Probability of Meena Winning:**\nThe probability of Meena winning is the sum of the probabilities of the first two scenarios:\n* Probability of Meena winning immediately: 2/3\n* Probability of Meena winning on the next turn: 2/9\nTotal probability = 2/3 + 2/9 = **8/9** \n**Therefore, the probability that Meena will win is 8/9.** \n",
