        "Here's how to break down the problem and find the probability:\n**1. Visualizing the Problem**\nImagine a square with vertices at (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), and (0,1). Each point inside this square represents a possible pair of values for (a, b).  \n* The x-coordinate represents the value of 'a'.\n* The y-coordinate represents the value of 'b'.\n**2.  Understanding the Conditions**\nWe want to find the pairs (a, b) where rounding a and b individually, and then adding them, will give the same result as rounding their sum (c).  Let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n* **Scenario 1: Both a and b are less than 0.5**  \n    * Rounding a and b both gives 0.\n    * Rounding c (a + b) also gives 0.\n    * This scenario satisfies A + B = C.\n* **Scenario 2: Both a and b are greater than or equal to 0.5**\n    * Rounding a and b both gives 1.\n    * Rounding c (a + b) also gives 1.\n    * This scenario also satisfies A + B = C.\n* **Scenario 3: One of a or b is less than 0.5, and the other is greater than or equal to 0.5**\n    * Rounding one gives 0, the other gives 1.\n    * Rounding c (a + b) will give 1 if a + b \u2265 0.5, and 0 if a + b < 0.5.\n    * This scenario does NOT satisfy A + B = C.\n**3. Identifying the Favorable Region**\n* **Scenario 1:** The favorable region is the lower left triangle of the square, where both a and b are less than 0.5.\n* **Scenario 2:** The favorable region is the upper right triangle of the square, where both a and b are greater than or equal to 0.5.\n**4. Calculating the Probability**\n* The total area of the square is 1 (since each side has length 1).\n* The area of each favorable triangle is 1/2 * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8.\n* The total area of the favorable regions is 1/8 + 1/8 = 1/4.\nTherefore, the probability that A + B = C is **1/4**. \n",
        "Here's how we can break down the problem and solve it:\n**1. Visualizing the Problem**\nImagine a unit square where the x-axis represents the value of 'a' and the y-axis represents the value of 'b'.  Every point within this square represents a possible pair of (a, b).\n**2. Regions of Interest**\n* **Where A + B = C:**  Consider the lines where a + b = 0, 1, 2.  The area between these lines represents the combinations of (a, b) where A + B = C.\n* **Regions with A + B \u2260 C:** The areas outside these lines represent combinations where A + B \u2260 C.\n**3. Analyzing the Regions**\n* **Line a + b = 0:** This line is outside the unit square (since a and b are between 0 and 1).\n* **Line a + b = 1:** This line cuts through the unit square.  Any point above this line will round to A + B = 2 (since both a and b round up).  Any point below this line will round to A + B = 0.\n* **Line a + b = 2:** This line is also outside the unit square.\n**4. Calculating the Probability**\n* **Favorable Area:** The area between the line a + b = 1 and the top and right edges of the unit square represents the combinations where A + B = C.  This area is a right triangle with legs of length 1.\n* **Total Area:** The total area of the unit square is 1.\nTherefore, the probability that A + B = C is the ratio of the favorable area to the total area:\nProbability = (Area of triangle) / (Area of square) = (1/2) / 1 = **1/2**\n**In conclusion, the probability that A + B = C is 1/2.** \n",
        "Here's a step-by-step solution to this problem:\n**1. Visualizing the Problem**\nImagine a unit square where the x-axis represents the value of *a* and the y-axis represents the value of *b*.  Every point within this square represents a possible combination of *a* and *b*.\n**2. Understanding the Conditions**\n* **Rounding:** We need to consider how rounding *a*, *b*, and *c* affects their values. \n* **Equal Sum:**  We want to find the probability that the rounded values of *a* and *b* add up to the rounded value of *c*.\n**3. Identifying Favorable Outcomes**\nTo have  A + B = C, we need to consider different scenarios based on the rounding:\n* **Scenario 1: Both *a* and *b* round down**\n    * This happens when both *a* and *b* are less than 0.5. \n    * Their sum, *c*, will also be less than 1 and will round down to 0.\n    * This scenario corresponds to the lower left triangle of the unit square.\n* **Scenario 2: Both *a* and *b* round up**\n    * This happens when both *a* and *b* are greater than or equal to 0.5.\n    * Their sum, *c*, will be greater than or equal to 1 and will round up to 1.\n    * This scenario corresponds to the upper right triangle of the unit square.\n* **Scenario 3: One rounds up, one rounds down**\n    * This happens when one of *a* or *b* is less than 0.5 and the other is greater than or equal to 0.5.\n    * Their sum, *c*, will be between 0.5 and 1.5, and it will round to 1.\n    * This scenario corresponds to the two trapezoids in the middle of the unit square.\n**4. Calculating the Probability**\n* **Favorable Area:**  The total area of the favorable scenarios (the triangles and trapezoids) is 1/2 the area of the unit square (which is 1). \n* **Total Area:** The total possible outcomes are represented by the entire unit square, which has an area of 1.\nTherefore, the probability that A + B = C is **1/2**. \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualizing the Problem**\nImagine a square with sides of length 1.  Each point inside the square represents a pair of values (a, b), where 0 \u2264 a \u2264 1 and 0 \u2264 b \u2264 1. \n**2.  Understanding the Conditions**\n*  **A + B = C** means the sum of the rounded values of *a* and *b* is equal to the rounded value of their sum (*c*). \n* **Rounding:** \n    * If a number is closer to the lower integer, it rounds down.\n    * If a number is closer to the higher integer, it rounds up.\n    * If a number is exactly halfway between two integers, we'll assume it rounds up for consistency.\n**3.  Identifying Favorable Cases**\nWe need to find the areas within the square where the condition A + B = C holds true. There are a few scenarios:\n* **Scenario 1: Both a and b are less than 0.5**\n   *  In this case, both *a* and *b* round down to 0, and their sum *c* will also be less than 1 and round down to 0.  This satisfies A + B = C.\n   *  The region representing this scenario is a small square in the bottom left corner of our big square, with sides of length 0.5.\n* **Scenario 2: Both a and b are greater than or equal to 0.5**\n   *  Both *a* and *b* round up to 1, and their sum *c* will be greater than or equal to 1 and round up to 1.  This also satisfies A + B = C.\n   *  The region representing this scenario is a small square in the top right corner of our big square, with sides of length 0.5.\n* **Scenario 3: a is less than 0.5 and b is greater than or equal to 0.5 (or vice-versa)**\n   *  *a* rounds down to 0, and *b* rounds up to 1.  The sum *c* will be between 0.5 and 1.5. \n   *  If *c* is less than 1, it rounds down to 0, and A + B = C.\n   *  If *c* is greater than or equal to 1, it rounds up to 1, and A + B = C.\n   *  This scenario is represented by two triangles, one in the bottom right and one in the top left of the big square. The hypotenuse of each triangle is a diagonal line segment with length \u221a2 / 2.\n**4. Calculating Probability**\n* **Area of Favorable Cases:** The sum of the areas of the two squares (0.5 * 0.5 + 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.5) plus the sum of the areas of the two triangles (2 * (1/2 * 0.5 * 0.5) = 0.25) is 0.75.\n* **Area of the Entire Sample Space:** The area of the big square is 1 * 1 = 1.\n* **Probability:** The probability of A + B = C is the ratio of the area of favorable cases to the area of the entire sample space: 0.75 / 1 = **0.75**\n**Therefore, the probability that A + B = C is 0.75 or 75%.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the possibilities**\nImagine a square where the x-axis represents the value of *a* and the y-axis represents the value of *b*. Both *a* and *b* can range from 0 to 1.  \n**2. Identify the regions where A + B = C**\n* **Region 1:**  If both *a* and *b* are less than 0.5, then *a* and *b* will round down to 0, and *c* will round down to 0.  So, *A + B = C* in this region. \n* **Region 2:** If both *a* and *b* are greater than or equal to 0.5, then *a* and *b* will round up to 1, and *c* will round up to 2.  So, *A + B = C* in this region.\n**3.  Calculate the areas**\n* **Region 1:** This is a square with sides of length 0.5, so its area is 0.25.\n* **Region 2:** This is also a square with sides of length 0.5, so its area is 0.25.\n**4. Calculate the probability**\nThe total area of the square representing all possible values of *a* and *b* is 1. The probability that *A + B = C* is the ratio of the favorable area (Regions 1 and 2) to the total area:\nProbability = (Area of Region 1 + Area of Region 2) / Total Area = (0.25 + 0.25) / 1 = **0.5**\n**Therefore, the probability that A + B = C is 0.5 or 50%.** \n"
