        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding the Problem**\nThis is a combination problem because the order in which Mary chooses the locations doesn't matter.  We just need to figure out how many different groups of three she can create.\n**Solution**\n* **Step 1:  Calculate the total number of ways to choose 3 locations out of 5.**  This is represented by the combination formula: \u2075C\u2083 = 5! / (3! * 2!) \n* **Step 2: Simplify the formula.**  5! means 5*4*3*2*1, and so on.\n    * 5! / (3! * 2!) = (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((3 * 2 * 1) * (2 * 1))\n* **Step 3: Calculate the result.**\n    * (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((3 * 2 * 1) * (2 * 1)) = 120 / (6 * 2) = 120 / 12 = 10\n**Answer**\nThere are **10** different ways Mary can choose three of the five tourist locations. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n* **Step 1: Understand the problem**\n   Mary has 5 choices for her first location.  After she picks one, she has 4 choices left for her second location, and then 3 choices for her third.  \n* **Step 2:  Calculate the total possibilities (without considering order)**\n   We might think the answer is 5 * 4 * 3 = 60.  But this counts each combination multiple times (since the order doesn't matter).\n* **Step 3:  Correct for overcounting**\n   For each group of three locations, there are 3! (3*2*1 = 6) ways to order them.  So we've counted each group 6 times in our initial calculation.\n* **Step 4:  Divide to find the correct number of combinations**\n   To get the actual number of combinations (where order doesn't matter), we divide the initial result by 6:\n   60 / 6 = 10\n**Answer:** There are **10** ways Mary can choose 3 out of the 5 locations. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem**\nMary has 5 locations and needs to choose 3.
