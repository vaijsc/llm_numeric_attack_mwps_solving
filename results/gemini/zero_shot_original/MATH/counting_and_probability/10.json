    "solution": "Mr. Shearer has $\\frac{3}{4}(28)=21$ students with brown hair and $\\frac{6}{7}(28)=24$ students who are right-handed.  Since there are $28-24=4$ left-handed students, at most 4 of the 21 brown-haired students are left-handed.  Therefore, at least $\\boxed{17}$ of them are right-handed.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the number of students with brown hair:**\n* Three-fourths of the class have brown hair, so (3/4) * 28 students = 21 students have brown hair.\n**2. Find the number of students who are right-handed:**\n* Six-sevenths of the class are right-handed, so (6/7) * 28 students = 24 students are right-handed.\n**3. Consider the overlap:**\n* The smallest possible number of students who are both right-handed and have brown hair occurs when the groups of brown-haired students and right-handed students overlap as much as possible. \n* Since there are 21 brown-haired students and 24 right-handed students, the smallest possible overlap is 21 (the smaller number).\n**Therefore, the smallest possible number of students who are both right-handed and have brown hair is 21.** \n",

Find the number of students who are right-handed:**\n* Six-sevenths of the class are right-handed: (6/7) * 28 students = 24 students\n**3. Find the overlap:**\n* To find the smallest possible number of students who are both right-handed and have brown hair, assume the maximum number of students have only one of these traits. \n* There are 21 students with brown hair, and 24 students who are right-handed.  \n* To minimize the overlap, assume that 3 students have only brown hair (21 - 18 = 3) and 3 students are only right-handed (24 - 21 = 3).\n**4. Calculate the smallest possible overlap:**\n* Since 18 students have brown hair and 21 students are right-handed, the smallest possible number of students who have both traits is **18**. \n**Therefore, the smallest possible number of students who are both right-handed and have brown hair is 18.** \n",

Students who are Right-Handed:**\n* Six-sevenths of the class are right-handed: (6/7) * 28 students = 24 students\n**3. Finding the Overlap:**\n* To find the smallest possible number of students with both brown hair and being right-handed, we need to find the smallest overlap between the two groups.\n* Imagine the 21 brown-haired students are in one group and the 24 right-handed students are in another. To have the smallest overlap, we need to maximize the number of students in each group *not* in the overlap.\n* This means we want to maximize the number of students who are either brown-haired but *not* right-handed, or right-handed but *not* brown-haired. \n**4. Calculating the Overlap:**\n*  We have 21 brown-haired students and 24 right-handed students, for a total of 45.\n* Since we know there are only 28 students in the class, the maximum number of students that could be in only one group (either brown-haired only or right-handed only) is 45 - 28 = 17 students.\n* Therefore, the smallest possible number of students with both brown hair and being right-handed is 21 (brown-haired) - 17 (brown-haired only) = **4 students**.\n**Answer:** The smallest possible number of students that could be both right-handed and have brown hair is **4**. \n",

This is impossible, meaning *all* 21 students with brown hair must also be right-handed.\n**4. The smallest possible overlap:**\n* Since all 21 students with brown hair must also be right-handed, the smallest possible number of students who are both right-handed and have brown hair is **21**. \n",

Overlap:**\n* To find the smallest possible number of students with both brown hair and being right-handed, we need to consider the worst-case scenario.  Imagine that the students with brown hair are *completely separate* from the students who are right-handed.  \n* In this scenario, the 21 students with brown hair could all be left-handed, and the 24 right-handed students could all have a different hair color.\n**4. The Smallest Number:**\n*  To find the smallest possible overlap, we need to find the difference between the total number of students and the sum of those with brown hair and those who are right-handed:\n   * 28 students - 21 students - 24 students = -17\n* This result is negative, which means there must be some overlap.  The smallest possible overlap is **0** students.\n**Answer:** The smallest possible number of students that could be both right-handed and have brown hair is **0**. \n"
