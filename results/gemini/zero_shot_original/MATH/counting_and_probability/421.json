    "solution": "We can treat this list as a sequence with a repetitive pattern. We see the sequence repeats itself every 16 elements (from 1 to 9 then back to 2). Because 1000 divided by 16 is 62 with a remainder of 8, to get 1000 terms in this list, we repeat the block 62 times, and then go 8 more elements.  This means that the $1000^{\\text{th}}$ integer is the same as the $8^{\\text{th}}$ integer, which is $\\boxed{8}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Find the pattern:**\n* Suelyn counts up from 1 to 9 (9 numbers) and then down from 9 to 1 (another 9 numbers). \n* This creates a cycle of 18 numbers.\n**2. Determine how many cycles are in 1000 numbers:**\n* Divide 1000 by the length of the cycle: 1000 / 18 = 55 with a remainder of 10.\n**3. Interpret the remainder:**\n* This means there are 55 complete cycles of 18 numbers. \n* The remainder of 10 tells us that we need to count 10 more numbers into the next cycle.\n**4. Find the 1000th number:**\n* Since we're starting a new cycle at the beginning of the 10th number within the cycle, we start counting up from 1: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.\n**Therefore, the 1000th integer in Suelyn's list is 10.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Pattern Recognition:**\n* Notice that Suelyn's counting pattern creates a repeating cycle of 18 numbers (9 going up, 9 going down).\n**2. Finding the Remainder:**\n* Divide the desired position (1000) by the length of the cycle (18): \n   1000 \u00f7 18 = 55 with a remainder of 10\n**3. Interpreting the Remainder:**\n* The remainder of 10 tells us that the 1000th number is 10 positions into the repeating cycle. \n**4. Finding the 10th Number:**\n* Starting at the beginning of the cycle: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 8, 7...)\n* The 10th number in the cycle is **7**.\n**Therefore, the 1000th integer in Suelyn's list is 7.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Patterns:**\n* **Upward Sequence:**  Notice that Suelyn counts up from 1 to 9, a total of 9 numbers.\n* **Downward Sequence:** She then counts down from 9 to 1, another 9 numbers.\n**2. Cycles:**\n* Each complete \"up and down\" cycle consists of 18 numbers (9 up + 9 down).\n**3. Finding the 1000th Number:**\n* **Dividing:**  Divide 1000 by 18 (the length of a cycle): 1000 / 18 = 55 with a remainder of 10.\n* **Interpretation:** This means there are 55 complete cycles of 18 numbers each, and then 10 more numbers left over.\n* **Extra Numbers:** The extra 10 numbers will fall within an upward sequence (because 10 is less than 18).\n**4. The 1000th Number:**\n* **Finding the Starting Point:**  The 55 complete cycles take us up to 55 * 18 = 990 numbers.\n* **Counting Up:** We need to count up the next 10 numbers. Since we start at 1, the 1000th number will be 1 + 10 = **11**.\n**Answer:** The 1000th integer in Suelyn's list is **11**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Pattern Recognition**\n* Notice that Suelyn's sequence has a repeating pattern: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.\n* This pattern has 17 numbers.\n**2. Finding the Repeating Unit**\n* The 17 numbers in the pattern represent one complete cycle of Suelyn's counting.\n**3. Dividing to Find the Cycle**\n* Divide the target number (1000) by the number of numbers in the cycle (17):  1000 / 17 = 58 with a remainder of 14.\n**4. Interpreting the Remainder**\n* The quotient (58) tells us that the sequence repeats 58 times before reaching the 1000th number.\n* The remainder (14) tells us that the 1000th number is the 14th number within the repeating pattern.\n**5. Finding the 14th Number**\n* The 14th number in the pattern is **7**.\n**Answer:** The 1000th integer in Suelyn's list is **7**. \n",
