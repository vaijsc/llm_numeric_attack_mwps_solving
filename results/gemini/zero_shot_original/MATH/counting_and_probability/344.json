        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**Understanding the Problem**\n* **Indistinguishable Balls:** The balls are identical (like marbles).  We don't care which specific ball is in which box, just how many are in each.\n* **Indistinguishable Boxes:**  The boxes are the same (like two unmarked containers). \n**Possible Arrangements**\nWe can think about the ways to distribute the balls by considering the number of balls in each box:\n* **Box 1: 5, Box 2: 0** \n* **Box 1: 4, Box 2: 1**\n* **Box 1: 3, Box 2: 2**\n* **Box 1: 2, Box 2: 3**\n* **Box 1: 1, Box 2: 4**\n* **Box 1: 0, Box 2: 5**\n**Answer**\nThere are **6** ways to put 5 indistinguishable balls into 2 indistinguishable boxes. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**Understanding the Problem**\n* **Indistinguishable balls:**  All the balls are identical (e.g., they are all red).\n* **Indistinguishable boxes:** The boxes are the same (e.g., both are blue).  We only care about how many balls are in each box, not which box has which balls.\n**Possible Arrangements**\nSince the balls and boxes are indistinguishable, the only thing that matters is how many balls are in each box. Here are the possible scenarios:\n* **Scenario 1:** 5 balls in one box, 0 balls in the other. \n* **Scenario 2:** 4 balls in one box, 1 ball in the other.\n* **Scenario 3:** 3 balls in one box, 2 balls in the other.\n**Counting the Ways**\nWe have identified three possible arrangements.  Since the boxes are indistinguishable, there's only one way to achieve each arrangement.\n**Answer**\nThere are **3** ways to put 5 indistinguishable balls into 2 indistinguishable boxes. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding the Problem**\n* **Indistinguishable balls:**  The balls are identical (e.g., all red). We don't care about their individual order.\n* **Indistinguishable boxes:** We only care about how many balls are in each box, not which box is which.\n**Solution**\nWe can think of this as a problem of distributing 5 balls into two boxes. We can represent the balls with \"o\" and the dividers between boxes with \"|\".  \nFor example:\n* \"oooo|o\" represents 4 balls in the first box and 1 in the second.\n* \"oo|ooo\" represents 2 balls in the first box and 3 in the second.\nSince we have 5 balls and 1 divider, we have a total of 6 positions to fill.  We need to choose 1 of these positions for the divider.  This is a combination problem:\n* **Combinations:**  The number of ways to choose *r* items from a set of *n* items (where order doesn't matter) is denoted by  \"n choose r\" or  _n_C_r_  and calculated as:  n! / (r! * (n-r)!)\n**Calculation**\n* We have 6 positions to choose from (5 balls + 1 divider).\n* We need to choose 1 position for the divider.\nTherefore, the number of ways to put 5 balls into 2 indistinguishable boxes is:\n_6_C_1_ = 6! / (1! * 5!) = 6 \n**Answer:** There are **6** ways to put 5 indistinguishable balls into 2 indistinguishable boxes. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding the Problem**\n* **Indistinguishable balls:** The balls are identical, so we only care about how many are in each box, not which specific ball is where.\n* **Indistinguishable boxes:** The boxes are identical, so it doesn't matter which box we put the balls in first.\n**Solution**\nWe can represent the distribution of balls using stars and bars. Imagine the balls as stars (*) and the divider between the boxes as a bar (|):\n* **Example:**  \"**|****\" represents 0 balls in the first box and 5 balls in the second box.\n* **Example:**  \"***|**\" represents 3 balls in the first box and 2 balls in the second box.\nTo find the total number of ways, we need to arrange the stars and bars.  We have 5 stars and 1 bar:\n* **Total positions:** 6 (5 stars + 1 bar)\n* **Choosing the bar's position:**  We need to choose one of these 6 positions for the bar.\n**Calculation**\nThe number of ways to choose one position out of six is given by the combination formula:\n*  \u2076C\u2081 = 6! / (1! * 5!) = 6\n**Answer**\nThere are **6** ways to put 5 indistinguishable balls into 2 indistinguishable boxes. \n",
