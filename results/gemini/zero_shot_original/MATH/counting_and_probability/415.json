    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "We begin by factoring $336$. $336 = 2^4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7.$ Because we are looking for phone numbers, we want four single digits that will multiply to equal $336.$ Notice that $7$ cannot be multiplied by anything, because $7 \\cdot 2$ is $14,$ which is already two digits. So, one of our digits is necessarily $7.$  The factor $3$ can be multiplied by at most $2,$ and the highest power of $2$ that we can have is $2^3 = 8.$ Using these observations, it is fairly simple to come up with the following list of groups of digits whose product is $336:$ \\begin{align*}\n&1, 6, 7, 8\\\\\n&2, 4, 6, 7\\\\\n&2, 3, 7, 8 \\\\\n&3, 4, 4, 7\n\\end{align*}For the first three groups, there are $4! = 24$ possible rearrangements of the digits. For the last group, $4$ is repeated twice, so we must divide by $2$ to avoid overcounting, so there are $\\frac{4!}{2} = 12$ possible rearrangements of the digits. Thus, there are $3 \\cdot 24 + 12 = \\boxed{84}$ possible phone numbers that can be constructed to have this property.",

        "We need to find how many ways we can arrange the digits 7, 6, 2, and 4 to get a four-digit number.  Since there are 4 choices for the first digit, 3 choices for the second digit, and so on, there are $4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1 = \\boxed{24}$ possible phone numbers. \n",
        "Let's break down the problem to find the solution:\n* **Understanding the property:** We need to find phone numbers where the first three digits (336) equal the product of the last four digits.\n* **Prime factorization:**  To find the possible last four digits, let's prime factorize 336:\n    * 336 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 3 x 7\n* **Finding combinations:**  Now, we need to arrange these prime factors into groups of four.  We have to be careful to make sure we include the number 7 in each group since it's part of the original phone number. Here are the possible combinations:\n    * 7 x 6 x 2 x 4\n    * 7 x 4 x 3 x 2\n    * 7 x 3 x 2 x 8 \n* **Counting arrangements:** Each of these combinations can be arranged in 4! = 24 ways.  \n* **Total phone numbers:** Therefore, there are 3 combinations * 24 arrangements per combination = **72** seven-digit phone numbers starting with 336 that have the desired property. \n",
        "We need to find all the possible arrangements of the digits 7, 6, 2, and 4 that multiply to 336.  Since 336 is divisible by 7, we know 7 must be one of the digits.  Furthermore, 336/7 = 48, so we need to find the arrangements of 6, 2, and 4 that multiply to 48.\nThe only way to get 48 as a product of 6, 2, and 4 is to multiply them all together: 6 * 2 * 4 = 48.  \nTherefore, there are **4! = 24** different arrangements of the digits 7, 6, 2, and 4, and so there are **24** seven-digit phone numbers beginning with 336 that have the desired property. \n",
        "We need to find how many ways we can arrange the digits 7, 6, 2, and 4.  Since there are four digits, there are $4! = 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = \\boxed{24}$ ways to arrange them. \n",
        "We need to find how many ways we can arrange the digits 2, 4, 6, and 7 to get a product of 336. Since 336 is divisible by 8, and the only way to get a product divisible by 8 is to have at least one factor of 8, we know 2 and 4 must be together. \nNow, let's consider the possibilities:\n* **2467:** This works because $2 \\times 4 \\times 6 \\times 7 = 336$.\n* **2476:** This also works.\n* **6247:** This works.\n* **6274:** This works.\n* **7246:** This works.\n* **7264:** This works.\nWe see there are **6** different phone numbers that satisfy the condition. \n"
