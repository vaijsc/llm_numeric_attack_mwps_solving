    "solution": "We count the number of ways that some lane can be left empty, and subtract from the total number, $3^6=729$ because each driver has three choices. Suppose the left-turn lane is left empty. Then each driver is limited to 2 choices, and there are $2^6$ ways to leave the left-turn lane empty. The same logic gives $2^6$ ways to leave the center lane and right-turn lane open. But we have double-counted the situations where two lanes are left empty. Fortunately, since each driver must go into the third lane, there are only 3 situations we have over-counted. This leaves $3\\cdot2^6-3=189$ ways to leave at least one lane unoccupied, or $729-189=\\boxed{540}$ ways to occupy every lane.",

        "Here's how we can break down the problem:\n**Step 1:  Choosing the cars for each lane**\n* We need to choose 2 cars out of 6 to go straight. There are  \u2076C\u2082 = 15 ways to do this. \n* Once we've chosen the straight cars, we have 4 cars left.  We need to choose 2 of these to turn right. There are \u2074C\u2082 = 6 ways to do this.\n* The remaining 2 cars automatically go in the left-turn lane.\n**Step 2: Ordering the cars within each lane**\n* The 2 cars in the straight lane can be ordered in 2! = 2 ways.\n* The 2 cars in the right-turn lane can be ordered in 2! = 2 ways.\n* The 2 cars in the left-turn lane can be ordered in 2! = 2 ways.\n**Step 3: Combining the possibilities**\nTo get the total number of ways to arrange the cars, we multiply the possibilities from each step:\n15 ways (for choosing straight cars) * 6 ways (for choosing right cars) * 2 ways (ordering straight cars) * 2 ways (ordering right cars) * 2 ways (ordering left cars) = **360 ways**\n**Therefore, there are 360 ways the cars can stack up so that all three lanes are occupied.** \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem step by step:\n**1. Choosing the first car:**\n* There are 6 options for which car goes first.\n**2. Choosing the second car:**\n* After the first car is placed, there are 5 cars left. \n* We need to choose one of these to go into a different lane than the first car.  This gives us 5 options.\n**3. Choosing the third car:**\n* Now there are 4 cars left. \n* This car must go into the remaining lane, so we have 4 options.\n**4. Filling the rest of the lanes:**\n* The remaining 3 cars can be placed in any order in the lanes that already have cars in them.  There are 3! (3 factorial) ways to arrange these cars, which is 3 * 2 * 1 = 6.\n**5. Total Possibilities:**\nTo get the total number of ways the cars can stack up, we multiply the number of options at each step:\n6 * 5 * 4 * 6 = **720**\n**Therefore, there are 720 ways the cars can stack up at the light so that all three lanes are occupied.** \n",
        "Here's how we can break down the problem:\n**Step 1: Filling the Left Lane**\n* We have 6 choices for which car goes in the left-turn lane.\n**Step 2: Filling the Straight Lane**\n* After the left lane is filled, we have 5 cars remaining. \n* Any of these 5 cars can go straight.\n**Step 3: Filling the Right Lane**\n* Now, we have 4 cars left.\n* Any of these 4 cars can take the right turn.\n**Calculating the Total Possibilities**\nTo get the total number of ways the cars can stack up, we multiply the number of possibilities at each step:\n6 choices * 5 choices * 4 choices = 120\n**Therefore, there are 120 ways the six cars can stack up so that all three lanes are occupied.** \n",

        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1.  Choosing the Cars for Each Lane**\n* We need to choose 2 cars out of 6 to go straight. This can be done in  \u2076C\u2082 ways (6 choose 2), which is 6!/(2!4!) = 15 ways.\n* We need to choose 2 cars out of the remaining 4 to turn right.

Combining the Choices**\nTo get the total number of ways the cars can stack up, we multiply the possibilities for each step:\n* **Total ways = (Ways to choose cars for each lane) * (Ways to arrange cars within each lane)**\n* Total ways = (\u00b9\u2075 * \u2076 * \u00b2) * (\u00b2 * \u00b2 * \u00b2) = 720\n**Therefore, there are 720 different ways the six cars can stack up at the red light so that all three lanes are occupied.** \n"
