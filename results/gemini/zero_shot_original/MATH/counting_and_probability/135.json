    "solution": "The rectangular region is 10 units by 8 units, resulting in an 8 by 6 rectangular region in the interior, which forms a 9-by-7 array of lattice points.

It is a common mistake to count the interior squares, for 48, instead of interior lattice points, which gives the correct answer of 63.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Rectangle**\nImagine a rectangle with the given vertices.  It will be centered at the origin (0,0) and have sides of length 10 units.\n**2. Consider the Boundaries**\n* The rectangle's sides lie on the lines x = 5, x = -5, y = 4, and y = -4. \n* Points on these lines have at least one integer coordinate that is a boundary value (5, -5, 4, or -4). These points are *not* strictly inside the rectangle.\n**3.  Count Interior Points**\n* **Horizontal and Vertical:** Within the rectangle, there are 9 integer values for x (-4, -3, -2, ..., 4) and 7 integer values for y (-3, -2, -1, ..., 3).\n* **Total:** To find the number of interior points, we multiply the possibilities for x and y: 9 * 7 = **63**\n**Answer:** There are **63** points with integer coordinates strictly inside the rectangular region. \n",

It's centered at the origin (0,0) and has a width of 10 units and a height of 8 units.\n**2. Count the Points on Each Side**\n* **Horizontal Sides:**  Each horizontal side has 10 integer points (from -5 to 5, including the endpoints).\n* **Vertical Sides:** Each vertical side has 8 integer points (from -4 to 4, including the endpoints).\n**3. Consider Overlap**\nWe've counted the corner points twice (once for each side they're on).  There are 4 corners, so we've overcounted by 4.\n**4. Calculate the Interior Points**\n* Total points on all sides: (10 + 10 + 8 + 8) = 36\n* Subtract the overcounted corners: 36 - 4 = 32\n* The rectangle's interior has: 32 - 4 (for the vertices) = **28** points with integer coordinates. \n**Therefore, there are 28 points with integer coordinates strictly inside the rectangular region.** \n",

Consider the Boundaries**\nThe rectangle's boundaries are defined by the lines:\n*  x = 5\n*  x = -5\n*  y = 4\n*  y = -4\n**3.  Count the Interior Points**\nWe need to count the points with integer coordinates that lie strictly within the rectangle.  This means the points cannot be on the boundaries.\n* **Horizontal Lines:**  Between the lines x = -5 and x = 5, there are 9 possible x-coordinates ( -4, -3, -2, ..., 4).\n* **Vertical Lines:** Between the lines y = -4 and y = 4, there are 7 possible y-coordinates (-3, -2, -1, ..., 3).\n**4. Total Interior Points**\nFor each of the 9 possible x-coordinates, there are 7 possible y-coordinates.  Therefore, there are a total of 9 * 7 = **63** points with integer coordinates strictly inside the rectangle. \n",

Points on these lines are *not* in the interior of the rectangle.\n3. **Count the interior points:**  Since the rectangle is centered at the origin, we can focus on one quadrant and then multiply our count by 4.\n   - **First quadrant:**  We need to count the points with integer coordinates where 0 < x < 5 and 0 < y < 4. There are 4 possible x-values (1, 2, 3, 4) and 3 possible y-values (1, 2, 3), giving us 4 * 3 = 12 points in this quadrant.\n   - **All quadrants:** Since there are four quadrants, the total number of points in the interior of the rectangle is 12 * 4 = **48**. \n",

Consider the Boundaries**\nThe rectangle's boundary includes all points with x-coordinates of -5, 5, and all points with y-coordinates of 4, -4. We don't want points on the boundary, only points strictly *inside* the rectangle.\n**3. Count Interior Points**\n* **X-coordinate:** The x-coordinate of any interior point must be strictly between -5 and 5.  This means the possible x-values are -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.  That's 9 possible x-values.\n* **Y-coordinate:**  Similarly, the y-coordinate of any interior point must be strictly between -4 and 4. This means the possible y-values are -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, and 3.  That's 7 possible y-values.\n**4. Total Interior Points**\nSince each x-value can be paired with any of the y-values, we have 9 x-values * 7 y-values = **63** possible interior points with integer coordinates. \n"
