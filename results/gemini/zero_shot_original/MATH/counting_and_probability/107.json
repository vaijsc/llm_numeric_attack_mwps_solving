For example, if Annie arrived at 2:00, Xenas could arrive at any time between 2:00 and 2:45 and see Annie at the party.  Let one hour equal one unit.  Then, we can calculate the area of the shaded region as the area of the entire square minus the areas of the two unshaded triangles.  This equals $$2\\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{5}{4} \\cdot \\frac{5}{4}=\\frac{25}{16}.$$ So the area of the shaded region is $$4-\\frac{25}{16}=\\frac{64-25}{16}= \\frac{39}{16}.$$ Since the area of the square is 4, the probability that Annie and Xenas see each other at the party is $$\\dfrac{39/16}{4} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{39}{64}}.$$",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step by step:\n**1. Visualize the Problem**\nImagine a square where the x-axis represents Annie's arrival time and the y-axis represents Xena's arrival time. Each point within the square represents a possible combination of arrival times. \n**2. Define the Favorable Outcomes**\nAnnie and Xena will see each other if their arrival times are within 45 minutes of each other.  To visualize this, draw two diagonal lines on the square.  \n* One line with a slope of 1, starting at the point (2:00, 2:45) and going to (4:00, 3:45). This represents Annie arriving 45 minutes before Xena.\n* Another line with a slope of 1, starting at the point (2:45, 2:00) and going to (3:45, 4:00). This represents Xena arriving 45 minutes before Annie.\nThe area between these two lines represents the combinations of arrival times where they will see each other.\n**3. Calculate Areas**\n* **Total Area:** The square has sides of length 2 hours (120 minutes), so its area is 120 * 120 = 14,400 square minutes.\n* **Unfavorable Area:** The area outside the two diagonal lines is made up of two triangles. Each triangle has a base of 75 minutes and a height of 75 minutes, so the area of each is (1/2) * 75 * 75 = 2812.5 square minutes. The total unfavorable area is 2 * 2812.5 = 5625 square minutes.\n* **Favorable Area:** The area where they see each other is the total area minus the unfavorable area: 14,400 - 5625 = 8775 square minutes.\n**4. Calculate Probability**\nThe probability of Annie and Xena seeing each other is the favorable area divided by the total area:\nProbability = 8775 / 14,400 = **0.61** (approximately)\n**Therefore, the probability that Annie and Xena see each other at the party is approximately 61%.** \n",
        "Here's how to break down the problem and solve it:\n**1. Visualize the Problem**\nImagine a square where the x-axis represents Annie's arrival time and the y-axis represents Xena's arrival time. Each axis ranges from 2:00 to 4:00 (a total of 2 hours).\n**2. Favorable Outcomes**\n* For Annie and Xena to see each other, their arrival times must be within 45 minutes (0.75 hours) of each other.  \n* This creates a \"band\" of favorable outcomes within our square.  Draw two diagonal lines: one going up and to the right starting at (2:00, 2:45) and another going down and to the right starting at (2:45, 2:00).  The area between these lines represents the times when they overlap.\n**3. Calculate Areas**\n* **Total Area:** The square has a side length of 2 hours, so its area is 2 * 2 = 4 square hours.\n* **Favorable Area:**  The favorable area is a parallelogram. You can find its area by:\n    * Finding the area of the whole square.\n    * Subtracting the areas of the two right triangles outside the parallelogram.\n**4. Calculate Probability**\n* **Probability = (Favorable Area) / (Total Area)**\n**Calculations**\n* **Area of square:** 4 square hours\n* **Area of each triangle:** (0.75 hours * 1.25 hours) / 2 = 0.46875 square hours\n* **Area of parallelogram:** 4 - (0.46875 + 0.46875) = 3.0625 square hours\n* **Probability:** 3.0625 / 4 = 0.765625\n**Answer:** The probability that Annie and Xena see each other at the party is approximately 0.766 or 76.6%. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Problem**\nImagine a square where the x-axis represents Annie's arrival time and the y-axis represents Xena's arrival time.  Each axis ranges from 2:00 to 4:00 (a 2-hour span).\n**2. Favorable Outcomes**\nWe want Annie and Xena to overlap at the party.  This means their arrival times must be within 45 minutes of each other. \n* **Draw lines:** On the square, draw lines that are 45 minutes (3/4 of an hour) away from the diagonal line (where Annie and Xena arrive at the same time).  These lines will create a \"band\" around the diagonal where their arrival times overlap. \n**3. Calculate Area**\n* **Total area:** The square has an area of 2 hours * 2 hours = 4 square hours.\n* **Favorable area:** The \"band\" of overlap represents the area where Annie and Xena see each other.  This area is a bit tricky to calculate directly.  Instead, we'll calculate the area *outside* the band and subtract from the total area.\n**4. Area Outside the Band**\n* **Two triangles:** The area outside the band consists of two right triangles at the top and bottom of the square. Each triangle has a base of 2 hours and a height of 1.75 hours (2 hours - 45 minutes).\n* **Area of each triangle:** (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 2 hours * 1.75 hours = 1.75 square hours.\n* **Total area outside band:** 1.75 square hours * 2 triangles = 3.5 square hours.\n**5. Probability**\n* **Favorable area:**  Total area - area outside band = 4 square hours - 3.5 square hours = 0.5 square hours.\n* **Probability:** (Favorable area) / (Total area) = 0.5 square hours / 4 square hours = 1/8.\n**Therefore, the probability that Annie and Xena see each other at the party is 1/8.** \n",

Each axis ranges from 2:00 to 4:00 (which is a 2-hour span).\n**2. Favorable Outcomes**\nWe want to find the area of the square where Annie and Xena overlap.  This means they need to arrive within 45 minutes of each other.  \n* **Draw lines:**  Draw diagonal lines from the bottom left corner (2:00, 2:00) to the top right corner (4:00, 4:00) with a slope of 1 (representing a 45-minute difference in arrival times). These lines will divide the square into four triangles.\n* **Shaded area:** The area where Annie and Xena overlap is the middle square formed by these lines. \n**3. Calculate Areas**\n* **Square:** The entire square representing all possible arrival times has an area of 2 hours * 2 hours = 4 square hours.\n* **Middle Square:** The side of the middle square is 1.5 hours (2 hours - 45 minutes). Its area is 1.5 hours * 1.5 hours = 2.25 square hours.\n**4. Probability**\nThe probability that Annie and Xena see each other is the ratio of the favorable area (middle square) to the total area (entire square):\nProbability = (2.25 square hours) / (4 square hours) = **0.5625**\n**Therefore, there is a 56.25% probability that Annie and Xena will see each other at the party.** \n",

Calculate the Area**\n* The total area of the square represents all possible combinations of arrival times: 120 minutes * 120 minutes = 14,400 square minutes.\n* The area of the diagonal band represents the favorable outcomes where they see each other.  To calculate this, think of it as two triangles:\n    * The base of each triangle is 120 minutes.\n    * The height of each triangle is 45 minutes.\n    * Area of a triangle = (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 120 * 45 = 2700 square minutes.\n    * Total area of the band is 2 * 2700 = 5400 square minutes.\n**4.
