        "Here's how to determine the number of ways to arrange the letters of the word \"ELLIPSE\":\n**1. Count the letters:**\n* There are 7 letters in the word \"ELLIPSE\".\n**2. Identify repeated letters:**\n* The letter 'E' appears 3 times.\n* The letter 'L' appears 2 times.\n**3. Calculate the arrangements:**\n* If all letters were unique, there would be 7! (7 factorial) ways to arrange them.  That's 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 5040.\n* However, we need to account for the repeated letters.  To do this, we divide by the factorial of the number of times each letter is repeated:\n    * Divide by 3! (3 factorial) because 'E' repeats 3 times (3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6)\n    * Divide by 2! (2 factorial) because 'L' repeats 2 times (2! = 2 * 1 = 2)\n**4. The final calculation:**\nThe total number of ways to arrange the letters of \"ELLIPSE\" is:\n(7!)/(3! * 2!) = 5040 / (6 * 2) = **420**\n**Therefore, there are 420 different ways to arrange the letters of the word \"ELLIPSE\".** \n",

Account for repetitions:**\n* The letter \"E\" appears 3 times.\n* The letter \"L\" appears 2 times.\n**3. Calculate the arrangements:**\n* If all letters were unique, there would be 7! (7 factorial) ways to arrange them.  7! = 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 5040.\n* However, since some letters are repeated, we need to divide by the factorial of the number of repetitions for each letter.\n**4. Formula:**\nThe number of arrangements is calculated as:\nTotal arrangements = (Total number of letters)! / (Repetitions of first letter)! * (Repetitions of second letter)! * ...\n**5. Apply the formula:**\n* Total arrangements = 7! / (3! * 2!) = 5040 / (6 * 2) = 5040 / 12 = 420\n**Therefore, there are 420 different ways to arrange the letters of the word \"ELLIPSE\".** \n",

Account for Repetitions:**\n* The letter \"L\" appears 3 times.\n* The letter \"E\" appears 2 times.\n**3. Apply the Formula:**\nThe number of ways to arrange *n* objects, where some are identical, is given by:\nn! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nk!)\nwhere:\n* n is the total number of objects\n* n1, n2, ... nk are the number of repetitions of each type of object.\n**4. Calculation:**\n* n = 7 (total letters)\n* n1 = 3 (number of \"L\"s)\n* n2 = 2 (number of \"E\"s)\nTherefore, the number of ways to arrange the letters of \"ELLIPSE\" is:\n7! / (3! * 2!) = (7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((3 * 2 * 1) * (2 * 1)) = 5040 / 12 = **420**\n**Answer:** There are 420 different ways to arrange the letters of the word \"ELLIPSE\". \n",
