        "Here's how to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 5!, 10!, and 15!:\n**Understanding Factorials**\n* **Factorial:** A factorial (represented by the symbol \"!\") means multiplying a number by all the positive whole numbers less than it. For example:\n    * 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120\n    * 10! = 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 3,628,800\n    * 15! = 15 * 14 * 13 * ... * 2 * 1 (a very large number)\n**Finding the GCF**\n1. **Identify the smallest factorial:** The smallest factorial in this case is 5!.\n2. **Analyze the factors:**  Every factorial is divisible by all the factorials smaller than it.  \n   * 10! is divisible by 5! because 10! = 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5!\n   * 15! is divisible by 5! because 15! = 15 * 14 * 13 * ... * 6 * 5! \n3. **Conclusion:**  The greatest common factor of 5!, 10!, and 15! is **5!** (which is equal to 120). \n",
