Case: x = 1**\n* If x = 1, Condition I is automatically satisfied. \n* To satisfy Condition II, we need either:\n    * x = 0 (not possible because we already set x = 1)\n    * x = 2 (not possible because we already set x = 1)\n    * y = 1 \nSo, one possible solution is (1, 1).\n**2. Case: y = 0**\n* If y = 0, Condition I is automatically satisfied.\n* To satisfy Condition II, we need either:\n    * x = 0 \n    * x = 2\n    * y = 1 (not possible because we already set y = 0)\nSo, two possible solutions are (0, 0) and (2, 0).\n**3. Case: y = 2**\n* If y = 2, Condition I is automatically satisfied.\n* To satisfy Condition II, we need either:\n    * x = 0 \n    * x = 2\n    * y = 1 (not possible because we already set y = 2)\nSo, two possible solutions are (0, 2) and (2, 2).\n**4.
