    "solution": "More generally, suppose coin $A$ is tossed $n + 1$ times and coin $B$ is tossed $n$ times.\n\nConsider the situation when coin $A$ has been tossed $n$ times and coin $B$ has been tossed $n$ times.  At this point, in terms of heads, either $A$ is ahead of $B,$ $B$ is ahead of $A,$ or they are tied.  Let $p$ be the probability that $A$ is ahead of $B.$  Then by symmetry, $p$ is the probability that $B$ is ahead of $A,$ so the probability of a tie is $1 - 2p.$\n\nNow coin $A$ is tossed one more time.  If coin $A$ ends up with more heads, then either it was ahead before the last flip (which occurs with probability $p$), or it was tied before the last flip and got heads for the last flip (which occurs with probability $(1 - 2p) \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}$).  Therefore, the probability that coins $A$ ends up with more heads is\n\\[p + (1 - 2p) \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}.\\]",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Possible Outcomes**\n* **Coin A:**  There are 2 possible outcomes for each toss (heads or tails), and it's tossed 3 times, so there are 2 x 2 x 2 = 8 possible outcomes.\n* **Coin B:** There are 2 x 2 = 4 possible outcomes for the two tosses.\n**2. Listing Outcomes**\nLet's list the outcomes for each coin, using H for heads and T for tails:\n* **Coin A:**  HHH, HHT, HTH, THH, HTT, THT, TTH, TTT\n* **Coin B:** HH, HT, TH, TT\n**3. Analyzing the Outcomes**\nWe want to find the cases where Coin A has more heads than Coin B. Let's examine each possible outcome for Coin B:\n* **Coin B = HH:** Coin A needs at least 3 heads (HHH).  There's 1 favorable outcome for Coin A (HHH).\n* **Coin B = HT:**  Coin A needs at least 2 heads. There are 3 favorable outcomes for Coin A (HHT, HTH, THH).\n* **Coin B = TH:** Same as HT: 3 favorable outcomes for Coin A.\n* **Coin B = TT:** Coin A needs at least 1 head.  There are 7 favorable outcomes for Coin A (all except TTT).\n**4. Calculating Probability**\n* **Total Possible Outcomes:** 8 (for Coin A) * 4 (for Coin B) = 32\n* **Favorable Outcomes:** 1 + 3 + 3 + 7 = 14\nTherefore, the probability of getting more heads with Coin A than Coin B is **14/32**, which simplifies to **7/16**. \n",

Favorable Outcomes**\nWe need to find the combinations where coin A has more heads than coin B. Let's analyze the cases based on the number of heads for coin B:\n* **Coin B has 0 heads:** Coin A must have at least one head (all 8 outcomes are favorable).\n* **Coin B has 1 head:** Coin A must have at least 2 heads. This gives us the following favorable outcomes for coin A: HHH, HHT, HTH, THH (4 outcomes).\n* **Coin B has 2 heads:** This case is impossible, as coin A cannot have more heads than 2.\n**3.  Calculate the Probability**\n* **Total possible outcomes:** 8 outcomes for coin A * 4 outcomes for coin B = 32 total outcomes.\n* **Favorable outcomes:** 8 (0 heads for B) + 4 (1 head for B) = 12 favorable outcomes.\n**Therefore, the probability of coin A having more heads than coin B is 12/32, which simplifies to 3/8.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Possible Outcomes**\n* **Coin A:**  Each toss of coin A has 2 possibilities (Heads or Tails). With three tosses, there are 2 * 2 * 2 = 8 possible outcomes.\n* **Coin B:**  Each toss of coin B also has 2 possibilities. With two tosses, there are 2 * 2 = 4 possible outcomes.\n**2. Analyzing Cases**\nTo get more heads with coin A than coin B, we need to consider the following:\n* **Coin B gets 0 heads:** This means coin B gets two tails (TT). Coin A can get any number of heads (HHH, HHT, HTH, THH, HTT, THT, TTH, TTT). This gives us 8 favorable outcomes.\n* **Coin B gets 1 head:** This means coin B gets one head and one tail (HT or TH). Coin A needs at least two heads (HHH, HHT, HTH, THH). This gives us 4 favorable outcomes for each of the two possibilities for coin B, for a total of 8 favorable outcomes. \n**3. Total Favorable Outcomes**\nWe have a total of 8 + 8 = 16 favorable outcomes.\n**4. Total Possible Outcomes**\nThe total number of possible outcomes is the product of the possibilities for coin A and coin B: 8 * 4 = 32.\n**5. Probability**\nThe probability of getting more heads with coin A than coin B is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes: 16/32 = **1/2**. \n",

Listing the Outcomes (for clarity)**\nLet's represent heads as \"H\" and tails as \"T\":\n* **Coin A:** {HHH, HHT, HTH, THH, HTT, THT, TTH, TTT}\n* **Coin B:** {HH, HT, TH, TT}\n**3.  Favorable Outcomes**\nWe want to find the outcomes where coin A has more heads than coin B.  Let's systematically check:\n* **Coin B has 0 heads (TT):**  All outcomes for coin A except TTT are favorable.  There are 7 favorable outcomes.\n* **Coin B has 1 head (HT or TH):** Coin A needs 2 heads.  There are 3 favorable outcomes (HHT, HTH, THH).\n* **Coin B has 2 heads (HH):** Coin A needs 3 heads. There's 1 favorable outcome (HHH).\n**4. Total Favorable Outcomes**\nThere are 7 + 3 + 1 = 11 favorable outcomes.\n**5. Probability**\nThe probability of getting more heads with coin A than coin B is:\n(Favorable Outcomes) / (Total Possible Outcomes) = 11 / (8 x 4) = **11/32** \n",

Here are all the possible outcomes:\n* **Coin A:**  HHH, HHT, HTH, THH, HTT, THT, TTH, TTT\n* **Coin B:**  HH, HT, TH, TT\n**3. Comparing Heads**\nNow we need to count the scenarios where coin A has *more* heads than coin B. We can do this systematically by looking at each outcome of coin B:\n* **Coin B = HH:** Coin A needs at least 3 heads.  This is only possible with the outcome HHH.\n* **Coin B = HT:**  Coin A needs at least 2 heads.  This is possible with HHH, HHT, HTH, THH.\n* **Coin B = TH:**  Same as above. \n* **Coin B = TT:** Coin A needs at least 1 head. This is possible with all outcomes except TTT.\n**4. Calculating the Probability**\n* **Favorable Outcomes:**  We have 1 + 4 + 4 + 7 = 16 favorable outcomes where coin A has more heads than coin B.\n* **Total Possible Outcomes:** The total number of possible combinations is 8 (for coin A) * 4 (for coin B) = 32.\n* **Probability:**  The probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total possible outcomes: 16/32 = **1/2**.\n**Therefore, the probability that more heads are tossed using coin A than using coin B is 1/2.** \n"
