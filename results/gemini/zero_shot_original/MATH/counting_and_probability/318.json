    "problem": "If all multiples of 3 and all multiples of 4 are removed from the list of whole numbers 1 through 100, then how many whole numbers are left?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "We know that every third whole number starting from one must be removed from the list. Since the greatest multiple of $3$ less than $100$ is $3\\cdot33=99$, this gives us a total of $33$ such numbers. We then consider the multiples of four. Every fourth whole number starting from one is a multiple of four and since $4 \\cdot 25=100$, this gives us $25$ such numbers. However, we also have to account for the numbers that are multiples of both $3$ and $4$ which we counted twice. These are the multiples of $12$ (the least common multiple of $3$ and $4$). Since $100 \\div 12 = 8 \\text{ R}4$, we know that there are $8$ multiples of both $3$ and $4$. Thus, we have $33+25-8=50$ numbers that we removed from the list. Since there were $100$ whole numbers total, this leaves us with $100-50=\\boxed{50}$ whole numbers.",

        "Here's how to solve this step-by-step:\n1. **Multiples of 3:**  There are 33 multiples of 3 between 1 and 100 (100 divided by 3 is approximately 33.33).\n2. **Multiples of 4:** There are 25 multiples of 4 between 1 and 100 (100 divided by 4 is 25).\n3. **Overlapping Multiples:**  We've counted the multiples of 12 (which are multiples of both 3 and 4) twice. There are 8 multiples of 12 between 1 and 100 (100 divided by 12 is approximately 8.33).\n4. **Total Removed:** To find the total numbers removed, we add the multiples of 3 and 4 and subtract the duplicates: 33 + 25 - 8 = 50.\n5. **Numbers Remaining:**  We started with 100 numbers and removed 50, leaving us with 50 numbers.\n**Answer:** There are **50** whole numbers left. \n",

Count the multiples of 3:**\n* The multiples of 3 from 1 to 100 are: 3, 6, 9, ..., 99.\n* To find out how many there are, divide 100 by 3: 100 / 3 = 33 with a remainder.  This means there are 33 multiples of 3.\n**2. Count the multiples of 4:**\n* The multiples of 4 from 1 to 100 are: 4, 8, 12, ..., 100.\n* Divide 100 by 4: 100 / 4 = 25.  There are 25 multiples of 4.\n**3.
