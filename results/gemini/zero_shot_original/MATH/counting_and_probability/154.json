        "Here's how we can solve this problem:\n**Understanding the Symmetries**\nThe grid has two lines of symmetry:\n* **Horizontal:**  The top row is a mirror image of the bottom row.\n* **Vertical:** The left column is a mirror image of the right column.\n**Using Symmetry to Limit Colors**\n* **Center Square:** Since the center square is on both lines of symmetry, it must be the same color as all its mirrored counterparts.\n* **Corner Squares:** Each corner square is mirrored by another corner square. They must be the same color.\n* **Edge Squares:**  Each edge square (excluding the center square) is mirrored by another edge square. They must be the same color.\n**Maximizing Colors**\nTo maximize the number of colors, we can assign a different color to:\n* The center square\n* One corner square \n* One edge square (excluding the center square)\n**Therefore, the maximum number of colors that could have been used is 3.** \n",
        "Here's how we can figure out the maximum number of colors:\n**Understanding the Symmetries**\n* **Vertical Symmetry:** The grid is symmetrical about a vertical line down the middle. This means squares in the left column must have the same color as their corresponding squares in the right column.\n* **Diagonal Symmetry:** The grid is symmetrical about a diagonal line from the top left to the bottom right corner. This means squares along the main diagonal must have the same color.\n**Finding the Maximum Colors**\n1. **The Center Square:** The center square (where the two lines of symmetry intersect) must be the same color as itself (due to symmetry). \n2. **The Diagonal:**  Since the diagonal squares must be the same color, we can potentially use a second color for all the squares along the diagonal.\n3. **The Remaining Squares:**  Each remaining square is paired with another square due to the vertical symmetry. To maximize colors, we can use a different color for each of these pairs.\n**Counting the Colors**\n* We need one color for the center square.\n* We need one color for the diagonal squares.\n* We need two more colors for the remaining four pairs of squares.\nTherefore, the maximum number of colors that could have been used is **4**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Understanding the Symmetries**\n* **Vertical Symmetry:**  The grid has a vertical line of symmetry down the middle. This means the left side of the grid must be a mirror image of the right side.\n* **Diagonal Symmetry:** The grid has a diagonal line of symmetry from the top left corner to the bottom right corner. This means the squares along this diagonal must be the same color.\n**2. Analyzing the Grid**\n* **Center Square:** The center square lies on both lines of symmetry.  Therefore, it must be the same color as the squares directly above, below, to the left, and to the right.\n* **Corner Squares:** The top left and bottom right corner squares are also on the diagonal symmetry line, so they must be the same color.  Similarly, the top right and bottom left corner squares must be the same color.\n**3. Maximum Colors**\n* We can have a different color for the top left/bottom right corners.\n* We can have a different color for the top right/bottom left corners.\n* We can have a different color for the center square.\n* We can have a different color for the squares directly above and below the center square.\n* We can have a different color for the squares directly to the left and right of the center square.\n**Therefore, the maximum number of colors that could have been used is 6.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understanding the Symmetries**\nThe grid has two lines of symmetry:\n* **Horizontal:**  The top row is a mirror image of the bottom row.\n* **Vertical:** The left column is a mirror image of the right column.\n**2. Using Symmetry to Limit Colors**\n* **Diagonal Symmetry:** Notice that the two lines of symmetry create a diagonal line of symmetry as well. This means that the top-left square must be the same color as the bottom-right square, and the top-right square must be the same color as the bottom-left square. \n* **Center Square:** The center square is on both lines of symmetry, so it must be the same color as all the corner squares.\n**3. Maximum Colors**\nLet's think about the possible color arrangements:\n* **Corner Squares:** We can use one color for all four corner squares (since they are all symmetrical).\n* **Edge Squares:** We can use one color for the two squares on the top and bottom edges, and a different color for the two squares on the left and right edges.\n* **Center Square:** The center square must be the same color as the corners.\nTherefore, we can use a maximum of **3 different colors**.\n**Example:**\nWe could use:\n* **Red** for the corners and center\n* **Blue** for the top and bottom edges\n* **Green** for the left and right edges \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Understanding Symmetry**\n* **Vertical Symmetry:**  The grid is symmetric across the vertical line in the middle. This means that squares on opposite sides of this line must be the same color.\n* **Diagonal Symmetry:** The grid is symmetric across the diagonal line. This means that squares that are reflected across this line must be the same color.\n**2. Analyzing the Grid**\n* **Corners:** The four corner squares must all be the same color due to the vertical and diagonal symmetry.\n* **Edges:**  Each edge square must be the same color as its reflection across the vertical line. \n* **Center:** The center square doesn't have a direct reflection requirement, but it is affected by both symmetries.\n**3. Maximum Colors**\n* Since the corners must be the same color, we can use one color for them.\n* Each edge has two squares that must be the same color. There are four edges, but they only require two additional colors because the diagonal symmetry forces the colors of opposite edges to match.\n* The center square can be a unique color.\n**Therefore, the maximum number of colors that could be used is 1 (corners) + 2 (edges) + 1 (center) = 4 colors.** \n"
