    "solution": "The probability for a single dart to land in the non-shaded region is the ratio of the area of the non-shaded region to the area of the entire dartboard. The area of the entire dartboard is $\\pi \\cdot 6^2 = 36\\pi$. The area of the shaded region is the area of the second largest circle minus the area of the smallest circle, or $\\pi \\cdot 4^2 - \\pi \\cdot 2^2 = 12 \\pi$, so the area of the non-shaded region is $36\\pi - 12\\pi = 24\\pi$. Thus, our ratio is $\\frac{24\\pi}{36\\pi}=\\frac{2}{3}$. If each dart has a $\\frac{2}{3}$ chance of landing in a non-shaded region and there are 9 darts, then the expected number of darts that land in a non-shaded region is $9 \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} = \\boxed{6}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Calculate the areas of the circles:**\n* **Outermost circle:**  Radius = 6 inches, Area = \u03c0(6\u00b2) = 36\u03c0 square inches\n* **Second circle:** Radius = 4 inches, Area = \u03c0(4\u00b2) = 16\u03c0 square inches\n* **Innermost circle:** Radius = 2 inches, Area = \u03c0(2\u00b2) = 4\u03c0 square inches\n**2. Calculate the area of the shaded region:**\n* The shaded region is the area of the outermost circle minus the area of the second circle: 36\u03c0 - 16\u03c0 = 20\u03c0 square inches\n**3. Calculate the area of the non-shaded region:**\n* The non-shaded region is the area of the second circle minus the area of the innermost circle: 16\u03c0 - 4\u03c0 = 12\u03c0 square inches.\n**4. Determine the probability of a dart landing in the non-shaded region:**\n* Probability = (Area of non-shaded region) / (Area of the whole dartboard)\n* Probability = 12\u03c0 / 36\u03c0 = 1/3\n**5. Calculate the expected number of darts in the non-shaded region:**\n* Expected number of darts = Probability * Total number of darts\n* Expected number of darts = (1/3) * 9 = 3 darts\n**Therefore, we would expect 3 darts to land in the non-shaded region.** \n",
