        "Here's how to solve this problem using combinations:\n**Understanding the Problem**\n* We have 3 types of cookies: Chocolate Chip (CC), Oatmeal (O), and Peanut Butter (PB).\n* We need to choose 6 cookies in total.\n* The order we choose the cookies doesn't matter (e.g., CC-O-PB-CC-PB-O is the same as O-PB-CC-CC-O-PB).\n**Using Combinations**\nCombinations are used when order doesn't matter.  The formula for combinations is:\nnCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)\nWhere:\n* n is the total number of items\n* r is the number of items you're choosing\n**Applying the Formula**\n1. **Think of the problem as distributing 6 cookies into 3 categories:** We need to figure out how many cookies of each type Pat chooses.\n2. **Represent the cookies with stars and dividers:** Imagine 6 stars representing the cookies and 2 dividers to separate the types:\n   * **Example:**  **|***|*** \n      * This represents 0 chocolate chip cookies, 3 oatmeal cookies, and 3 peanut butter cookies.\n3. **Calculate the total arrangements:** We need to arrange 6 stars and 2 dividers. That's a total of 8 items.\n4. **Apply the combination formula:** \n   * n = 8 (total items)\n   * r = 2 (number of dividers)\n   8C2 = 8! / (2! * 6!) = (8 * 7) / (2 * 1) = 28\n**Answer**\nThere are **28** different assortments of six cookies Pat can select. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding the Problem**\nWe need to figure out how many different ways Pat can choose 6 cookies, considering that the order in which she picks them doesn't matter (chocolate chip, oatmeal, peanut butter is the same as oatmeal, peanut butter, chocolate chip). This is a classic combination problem.\n**Using Stars and Bars**\nA helpful way to visualize this is with \"stars and bars\":\n* **Stars:** Represent the cookies (6 stars in total).\n* **Bars:** Separate the different types of cookies. We need two bars to divide the cookies into three groups (chocolate chip, oatmeal, peanut butter).\nFor example, the arrangement **\"***|*|**\" represents 3 chocolate chip cookies, 0 oatmeal cookies, and 3 peanut butter cookies.\n**Counting the Arrangements**\nWe have 8 total positions (6 stars and 2 bars).  To find the number of combinations, we need to figure out how many ways we can choose 2 of those positions to be bars:\n* **Combinations:**  \u2078C\u2082 = (8!)/(2!6!) = 28\n**Therefore, there are 28 different assortments of six cookies that Pat can select.** \n",

        "Here's how to solve this problem using a combination approach:\n**Understanding the Problem**\nWe need to find the number of ways Pat can choose 6 cookies from 3 different types, without regard to order. This means we're dealing with combinations, not permutations.\n**Using Combinations**\n* **Think of it as dividing 6 spaces:** Imagine 6 empty spaces representing the cookies Pat will choose.\n* **Fill the spaces with cookie types:**  We need to figure out how many ways we can put \"C\" (chocolate chip), \"O\" (oatmeal), or \"P\" (peanut butter) into these spaces.\n**The Solution**\nWe can use a concept called \"stars and bars\" to solve this:\n1. **Stars:** Represent the cookies. We have 6 cookies, so 6 stars: ******\n2. **Bars:** We need two bars to divide the stars into 3 groups (one for each cookie type).  For example: **|***|*** \n   * This represents 2 chocolate chip cookies, 3 oatmeal cookies, and 1 peanut butter cookie.\nNow, we have 8 total positions (6 stars and 2 bars).  We need to choose 2 of these positions to be bars.  This is a combination problem:\n* **Total ways to choose 2 positions from 8:**  \u2078C\u2082 = 8! / (2! * 6!) = 28\n**Therefore, there are 28 different assortments of six cookies that Pat can select.** \n",
