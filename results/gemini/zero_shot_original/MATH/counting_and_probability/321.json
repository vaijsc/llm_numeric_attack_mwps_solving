    "solution": "Let $x$ represent the amount the player wins if the game is fair.  The chance of an even number is $1/2$, and the chance of matching this number on the second roll is $1/6$. So the probability of winning is $(1/2)(1/6)=1/12$. Therefore $(1/12)x=\\$5$ and $x=\\boxed{60}$.",

        "Here's how to break down the problem and find the fair winning amount:\n**1. Probability of Winning**\n* **First Roll:** The probability of rolling an even number is 3/6 = 1/2.\n* **Second Roll:**  If the first roll was even, the probability of matching it on the second roll is 1/6.\n* **Overall Probability of Winning:**  (1/2) * (1/6) = 1/12\n**2. Fair Winning Amount**\n* **Fair Game Condition:**  Probability of Winning * Amount Won = Cost to Play \n* **Let 'x' be the amount won:** (1/12) * x = $5\n* **Solving for x:**  x = $5 * 12 = $60\n**Therefore, the player should win $60 if the game is fair.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Probability of Winning**\n* The player wins if they roll an even number on the first roll *and* then roll the same number again.\n* Probability of rolling an even number on the first roll: 3/6 = 1/2\n* Probability of rolling the same even number again: 1/6 (since there's only one matching face on the die)\n* Probability of winning: (1/2) * (1/6) = 1/12\n**2. Probability of Losing**\n* The player loses if they roll an odd number on the first roll, or if they roll an even number on the first roll and a different even number on the second.\n* Probability of losing by rolling an odd number: 3/6 = 1/2\n* Probability of losing by rolling different even numbers: (1/2) * (5/6) = 5/12\n* Total probability of losing: (1/2) + (5/12) = 11/12\n**3. Setting Up the Fair Game Equation**\n* In a fair game, the expected value of playing is zero. This means the probability of winning times the amount won should equal the cost of playing.\n* Let 'x' represent the amount won.\n* The equation for a fair game is: (1/12) * x = $5 \n**4. Solving for 'x'**\n* Multiply both sides of the equation by 12: x = $60\n**Answer:** The player should win **$60** if the game is fair. \n",
        "Here's how to break down the problem and find the solution:\n**1. Probability of Winning**\n* **First Roll:** The probability of getting an even number on the first roll is 3/6 = 1/2.\n* **Second Roll:**  If the first roll was even, the probability of matching it on the second roll is 1/6 (only one face out of six matches). \n* **Overall Probability of Winning:** To win, you need both an even number on the first roll AND a match on the second.  So, the overall probability of winning is (1/2) * (1/6) = 1/12.\n**2. Fair Game Equation**\nIn a fair game, the expected value (average winnings) should equal the cost of playing. This can be represented as:\n(Probability of Winning) * (Amount Won) = (Cost of Playing)\n**3. Solving for the Amount Won**\n* We know the probability of winning is 1/12.\n* We know the cost of playing is $5.\n* Let \"x\" represent the amount won.\nSo, the equation becomes:\n(1/12) * (x) = $5\n**4. Calculate the Amount Won**\nTo solve for x, multiply both sides of the equation by 12:\nx = $5 * 12 \nx = $60\n**Answer:** The player should win $60 if the game is fair. \n",
        "Here's how to break down the problem and find the winning amount for a fair game:\n**1. Probability of Winning**\n* **Step 1: Probability of rolling an even number on the first roll:** There are 3 even numbers (2, 4, 6) on a six-sided die, and 6 total possibilities. So the probability is 3/6 = 1/2.\n* **Step 2: Probability of matching on the second roll:**  After rolling an even number, there's only one matching number on the die.  The total number of possibilities remains 6. So the probability is 1/6.\n* **Step 3: Probability of winning the entire game:** To win, the player must both roll an even number on the first roll AND match it on the second roll.  We multiply the individual probabilities: (1/2) * (1/6) = 1/12\n**2. Setting up the Fair Game Equation**\nIn a fair game, the expected value of the game should be zero. This means:\n(Probability of Winning) * (Amount Won) - (Cost to Play) = 0\n**3. Solving for the Amount Won**\n* We know the probability of winning is 1/12.\n* We know the cost to play is $5.\n* Let \"x\" represent the amount won.\nOur equation becomes:\n(1/12) * (x) - $5 = 0\n**4. Solving for x**\n* Add $5 to both sides: (1/12) * (x) = $5\n* Multiply both sides by 12: x = $60\n**Answer:** The player should win **$60** if the game is fair. \n",
