    "solution": "There are a total of ${9 \\choose 3} = \\frac{9\\cdot 8 \\cdot 7}{3 \\cdot 2} = 84$ sets of 3 coins in total. The only way to get 35 cents is to have a quarter and two nickels, which can be done in ${3 \\choose 1} \\cdot {3 \\choose 2} = 9$ ways. So, the probability is $\\frac{9}{84} = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{28}}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Figure out the possible combinations that equal 35 cents:**\n*  One quarter (25 cents) and two nickels (10 cents)\n**2. Calculate the probability of each combination:**\n* **Combination 1: Quarter, Nickel, Nickel**\n    * Probability of picking a quarter first: 3/9 (since there are 3 quarters out of 9 total coins)\n    * Probability of picking a nickel second (given a quarter was already chosen): 3/8 (since there are 3 nickels left out of 8 total coins)\n    * Probability of picking another nickel third: 2/7 (since there are 2 nickels left out of 7 total coins)\n    * Probability of this entire combination: (3/9) * (3/8) * (2/7) = 1/28\n**3. Since the order we pick the coins doesn't matter, we need to account for all the different orders this combination can occur:**\n* Quarter, Nickel, Nickel\n* Quarter, Nickel, Nickel\n* Nickel, Quarter, Nickel\n* Nickel, Nickel, Quarter\nThat's 4 different orders.\n**4. Calculate the total probability:**\n* Probability of getting 35 cents = (Probability of one combination) * (Number of possible orders) \n* Probability = (1/28) * (4) = 1/7\n**Therefore, the probability of Steve selecting three coins with a total value of 35 cents is 1/7.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Figure out the possible combinations:**\n* **35 cents:**  The only way to get 35 cents is with one quarter (25 cents) and two nickels (10 cents).\n**2. Calculate the probability of getting one quarter:**\n* There are 3 quarters and 9 total coins. \n* The probability of picking a quarter first is 3/9 = 1/3.\n**3. Calculate the probability of getting a nickel after a quarter:**\n* Now there are 8 coins left, and 3 of them are nickels.\n* The probability of picking a nickel is 3/8.\n**4. Calculate the probability of getting another nickel:**\n* There are 7 coins left, and 2 of them are nickels.\n* The probability of picking another nickel is 2/7.\n**5. Multiply the probabilities together:**\n* The probability of picking one quarter followed by two nickels is: (1/3) * (3/8) * (2/7) = 1/28\n**However...**\nWe need to account for the order in which the coins are picked. We could pick a nickel first, then a quarter, then a nickel.  There are actually three possible orders:\n* Quarter, Nickel, Nickel\n* Nickel, Quarter, Nickel\n* Nickel, Nickel, Quarter\n**6. Multiply the probability by the number of possible orders:**\n* The final probability of getting 35 cents is: (1/28) * 3 = **3/28** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Figure out the possible combinations:**\n* **35 cents can be made in only one way:**  1 quarter (25 cents) + 1 nickel (5 cents) + 1 penny (5 cents).\n**2. Calculate the total number of ways to choose 3 coins:**\n* There are 9 coins in total.\n* The number of ways to choose 3 out of 9 is given by the combination formula:  \u2079C\u2083 = (9!)/(3!6!) = 84.\n**3. Calculate the number of ways to choose the specific combination:**\n* To get the combination of 1 quarter, 1 nickel, and 1 penny, we need to:\n    * Choose 1 quarter out of 3: \u00b3C\u2081 = 3 ways\n    * Choose 1 nickel out of 3: \u00b3C\u2081 = 3 ways\n    * Choose 1 penny out of 3: \u00b3C\u2081 = 3 ways\n* So, the total number of ways to choose this specific combination is 3 * 3 * 3 = 27.\n**4. Calculate the probability:**\n* Probability = (Favorable outcomes) / (Total possible outcomes)\n* Probability = 27 / 84 \n* Probability = **9/28** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step by step:\n**1.  Figure out the possible combinations that add up to 35 cents:**\n* **Quarter, Nickel, Nickel:** This is the only combination that works.\n**2. Calculate the total number of ways to choose 3 coins:**\n* There are 9 coins total.\n* We need to choose 3, so we use combinations:  \u2079C\u2083 = (9 * 8 * 7) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 84\n**3. Calculate the number of ways to choose the winning combination:**\n* We need one quarter, one nickel, and one nickel.\n* Let's calculate the combinations for each:\n    *  \u00b3C\u2081 = 3 (ways to choose 1 quarter out of 3)\n    *  \u00b3C\u2081 = 3 (ways to choose 1 nickel out of 3)\n    *  \u00b3C\u2081 = 3 (ways to choose 1 nickel out of 3)\n* To get the total number of ways to choose the winning combination, we multiply: 3 * 3 * 3 = 27\n**4. Calculate the probability:**\n* Probability = (Favorable Outcomes) / (Total Possible Outcomes)\n* Probability = 27 / 84 \n* Probability = **9/28** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the total number of ways to choose 3 coins:**\n* Steve has 9 coins total (3 quarters + 3 nickels + 3 pennies).\n* He needs to choose 3, so we use combinations:  \u2079C\u2083 = (9 * 8 * 7) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 84\n**2. Find the number of ways to choose 3 coins that add up to 35 cents:**\n* The only combination that works is one quarter (25 cents) and two nickels (10 cents each).\n* We need to figure out how many ways we can choose 1 quarter out of 3, and 2 nickels out of 3.\n* Choosing 1 quarter out of 3: \u00b3C\u2081 = 3\n* Choosing 2 nickels out of 3: \u00b3C\u2082 = 3\n**3. Calculate the probability:**\n* The probability of selecting one quarter and two nickels is (\u00b3C\u2081 * \u00b3C\u2082) / \u2079C\u2083 = (3 * 3) / 84 = 9/84.\n**4. Simplify the fraction:**\n* 9/84 simplifies to **1/9**.\n**Therefore, the probability that Steve selects three coins with a total value of 35 cents is 1/9.** \n"
