Analyze the Geometry**\n* **Symmetry:** The problem has symmetry. We can focus on just one quadrant (e.g., the top right quadrant) and multiply our result by 4.\n* **Key Shapes:** In the top right quadrant, the region closer to *O* is bounded by the perpendicular bisectors of *AB* and *AD*.

Finding the Area of the Central Region**\n* **Symmetry:** The central region is a smaller rectangle.  Since the rectangle *ABCD* is symmetrical, the central region's sides are half the lengths of *AB* and *AD*. \n* **Side Lengths:** Let *AB* = 2*x* and *AD* = 2*y*.  Since *AB/AD = k*, we have *x/y = k*.  The central region has sides of length *x* and *y*.\n* **Area:** The area of the central region is *x* * y*.\n**4.
