    "solution": "First, we consider how many ways there are to choose three boys from eight. There are $8$ choices for the first boy, $7$ for the second, and $6$ for the third. However, because the boys are indistinct from one another, we have overcounted, and must divide by $3 \\cdot 2$. Similarly, there are $6 \\cdot 5$ ways to choose the two girls, divided by $2$ for overcounting. Thus, there are $\\frac{8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5}{3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2} = \\boxed{840}$ possible quintets.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Choosing the Boys:**\n* We need to choose 3 boys out of 8. This is a combination problem, as the order we choose the boys doesn't matter.\n* The formula for combinations is: nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!), where n is the total number of items and r is the number you're choosing.\n* In our case, we have 8 boys (n=8) and we're choosing 3 (r=3).\n* So, the number of ways to choose 3 boys is 8C3 = 8! / (3! * 5!) = (8 * 7 * 6) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 56\n**2. Choosing the Girls:**\n* We need to choose 2 girls out of 6.\n* Using the same combination formula, we get 6C2 = 6! / (2! * 4!) = (6 * 5) / (2 * 1) = 15\n**3. Combining the Choices:**\n* For every group of 3 boys, we can combine it with any group of 2 girls to form a quintet.\n* To find the total number of possible quintets, we multiply the number of ways to choose boys by the number of ways to choose girls: 56 * 15 = 840\n**Therefore, there are 840 possible quintets.** \n",
