    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The easiest approach is to consider how many times 8 can appear in the units place, how many times in the tens place, and how many times in the hundreds place.  If we put a 8 in the units place, there are 10 choices for the tens place and 10 choices for the hundreds place (including having no hundreds digit) for a total of $10\\times10=100$ options, which means that 8 will appear in the ones place 100 times. (If we choose the hundreds place to be equal to 0, we can just think of that as either a two digit or a one digit number.) Likewise, if we put an 8 in the tens place, there are 10 choices for the units place and 10 choices for the hundreds place for a total of 100 options and 100 appearances of 8 in the tens place. Finally, if we put a 8 in the hundreds place, we have 10 options for the units place and 10 options for the tens place for another 100 options and 100 appearances of 8. Since $100 + 100+100=300$, there will be a total of $\\boxed{300}$ appearances of 8.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step by step:\n**1. Consider the Hundreds Digit**\n* **0-700:** The digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all.\n* **800-899:** The digit 8 appears 100 times in the hundreds place (800, 801, 802,... 899).\n**2. Consider the Tens Digit**\n* **0-999:** The digit 8 appears 10 times in each hundred-number block (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, ... 980-989). This happens 10 times (for each hundred). So, the digit 8 appears 10 * 10 = 100 times in the tens place.\n**3. Consider the Units Digit**\n* **0-999:**  The digit 8 appears 10 times in each hundred-number block (8, 18, 28, ... 98). This happens 10 times (for each hundred). So, the digit 8 appears 10 * 10 = 100 times in the units place.\n**4. Total Count**\nAdd up the occurrences from each place value: 100 + 100 + 100 = **300**\n**Therefore, the digit 8 appears 300 times in the list of integers from 1 to 1000.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Consider the Hundreds Digit:**\n* **800-899:**  The digit '8' appears in the hundreds place 100 times (from 800 to 899).\n**2. Consider the Tens Digit:**\n* **080-089, 180-189, 280-289, ..., 980-989:** The digit '8' appears in the tens place 10 times in each hundred-number block (from 0 to 9), and there are 10 such blocks. So, the digit '8' appears in the tens place 10 * 10 = 100 times.\n**3. Consider the Units Digit:**\n* **8, 18, 28, ..., 998:**  The digit '8' appears in the units place 10 times in each hundred-number block. There are 10 such blocks. So, the digit '8' appears in the units place 10 * 10 = 100 times.\n**4. Total Count:**\nAdd up the occurrences from each place value: 100 + 100 + 100 = **300**\n**Therefore, the digit '8' appears 300 times in the list of all integers from 1 to 1000.** \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Consider the Hundreds Place:**\n* **080 - 089:**  The digit 8 appears 10 times in the hundreds place.\n* **180 - 189, 280 - 289, ... 980 - 989:**  This pattern repeats for each hundred, so there are 9 hundreds * 10 occurrences = 90 occurrences in total.\n**2. Consider the Tens Place:**\n* **80 - 89:** The digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (for every number from 80 to 89).\n* This pattern repeats for every hundred. So, there are 10 hundreds * 10 occurrences = 100 occurrences in total.\n**3. Consider the Units Place:**\n* **8, 18, 28, ... 998:** The digit 8 appears 100 times in the units place.\n**4. Sum the Occurrences:**\n* Total occurrences = 10 (hundreds place) + 90 (hundreds place) + 100 (tens place) + 100 (units place) = **300**\n**Therefore, the digit 8 appears 300 times in the list of integers from 1 to 1000.** \n",
        "Here's how we can figure out how many times the digit 8 appears in the numbers from 1 to 1000:\n**1. Consider each digit place:**\n* **Units Place:** The digit 8 appears once in every group of ten numbers (8, 18, 28,... 98). There are 100 such groups from 1 to 1000, so the digit 8 appears 100 times in the units place.\n* **Tens Place:** The digit 8 appears ten times in each group of one hundred numbers (80-89).  There are 10 such groups from 1 to 1000, so the digit 8 appears 100 times in the tens place.\n* **Hundreds Place:** The digit 8 appears once in every group of one hundred numbers (800-899). There are 10 such groups, so the digit 8 appears 100 times in the hundreds place.\n**2. Total Count:**\nAdd up the occurrences from each digit place: 100 + 100 + 100 = **300**\n**Therefore, the digit 8 appears 300 times in the numbers from 1 to 1000.** \n",
