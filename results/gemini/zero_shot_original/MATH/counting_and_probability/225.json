    "solution": "Let's try counting the number of perfect squares and cubes less than $441=21^2$. There are twenty perfect squares less than 441: $1^2, 2^2, \\ldots, 20^2$. There are also seven perfect cubes less than 441: $1^3, 2^3, \\ldots, 7^3$. So there would seem to be $20+7=27$ numbers less than 441 which are either perfect squares and perfect cubes.\n\nBut wait! $1=1^2=1^3$ is both a perfect square and a perfect cube, so we've accidentally counted it twice. Similarly, we've counted any sixth power less than 441 twice because any sixth power is both a square and a cube at the same time. Fortunately, the only other such one is $2^6=64$. Thus, there are $27-2=25$ numbers less than 441 that are perfect squares or perfect cubes. Also, since $20^2=400$ and $7^3=343$, then all 25 of these numbers are no more than 400. To compensate for these twenty-five numbers missing from the list, we need to add the next twenty-five numbers: 401, 402, $\\ldots$, 424, 425, none of which are perfect square or perfect cubes. Thus, the $400^{\\text{th}}$ term is $\\boxed{425}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Pattern**\nThe sequence consists of positive integers that are *not* perfect squares or perfect cubes.  This means we need to figure out which numbers *are* squares and cubes, and then exclude them.\n**2.  Squares and Cubes**\n* **Squares:** 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100...\n* **Cubes:** 1, 8, 27, 64, 125...\n**3. Finding the Gaps**\nNotice that the sequence starts with 2 (the first number that's not a square or a cube).  We need to find the gaps in the positive integers where squares and cubes appear.\n* **The first gap:**  The first few integers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.  We remove 1, 4, 8, 9, leaving us with 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10.\n* **The second gap:** The next few integers are 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27.  We remove 16, 25, 27, leaving us with 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26. \n**4.  Counting the Terms**\nTo find the 400th term, we need to count how many terms are in the sequence up to a certain point. Let's think about it in groups:\n* **Group 1:** 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11 (7 terms)\n* **Group 2:** 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26 (13 terms)\nNotice that the number of terms in each group increases by 6. This is because we're essentially skipping over squares and cubes. \n**5.  Finding the Pattern**\n* **Group 1:** Excludes 4, 8, 9 (3 terms)\n* **Group 2:** Excludes 16, 25, 27 (3 terms)\nEach group excludes 3 terms (one square and two cubes, or two squares and one cube, depending on the group).\n**6.  Calculating the 400th Term**\n* We need to find a group that contains the 400th term. \n* Each group has 6 more terms than the previous group.\n* Let's find a group with a number of terms close to 400. \n* Notice that the number of terms in a group is always 6 more than the previous group. This means that the groups form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 6.  We can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to find a group with a sum close to 400:  \n   *  Sum of an arithmetic series = (n/2)(first term + last term)\n* We want a sum close to 400.  Let's try a few values of 'n' (number of groups):\n   *  n = 10:  (10/2)(7 + 61) = 340\n   *  n = 11: (11/2)(7 + 67) = 418\n* This tells us that the 400th term is in the 11th group.\n**7. Finding the Specific Term within the Group**\n* The first term in the 11th group is 67 + 1 = 68\n* We need to find the 400 - 418 = -18th term from the start of the 11th group.\n* Since we're going backwards, the 18th term before the 68th term is 68 - 18 = 50\n**Therefore, the 400th term of the sequence is 50.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step by step:\n**1. Understanding the Pattern**\nThe sequence skips perfect squares (1, 4, 9, 16...) and perfect cubes (1, 8, 27...).  \n**2. Estimating the Growth Rate**\nSince we're dealing with squares and cubes, the sequence grows more slowly than the sequence of all positive integers. This is because we're skipping an increasing number of terms as we go further down the sequence.\n**3. Finding the Number of Squares and Cubes**\n* **Squares:** The largest perfect square less than 400 is 19\u00b2 = 361. So, there are 19 perfect squares less than 400.\n* **Cubes:** The largest perfect cube less than 400 is 7\u00b3 = 343. So, there are 7 perfect cubes less than 400.\n**4. Accounting for Overlaps**\nNotice that 1 is both a square and a cube. We've counted it twice.  \n**5. Calculating the 400th Term**\n* There are 400 positive integers up to 400.\n* We need to subtract the number of squares and cubes (19 + 7 = 26), and add back 1 for the overlap: 400 - 26 + 1 = 375.\n**Therefore, the 400th term in the sequence is 375.** \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem:\n**Understanding the Pattern**\nThe sequence is formed by taking all positive integers and removing the perfect squares and perfect cubes.  Let's analyze how many numbers are removed up to a certain point:\n* **Squares:**  The largest perfect square less than or equal to a given number *n* is  \u230a\u221an\u230b, meaning the floor function (rounding down) of the square root of *n*.  So, there are \u230a\u221an\u230b perfect squares less than or equal to *n*.\n* **Cubes:**  Similarly, the largest perfect cube less than or equal to *n* is \u230a\u221bn\u230b. There are \u230a\u221bn\u230b perfect cubes less than or equal to *n*. \n**Important Note:**  We need to be careful about double-counting numbers that are both squares and cubes. A number is both a square and a cube if and only if it is a sixth power (e.g., 64 is both 8\u00b2 and 4\u00b3). \n**Finding the 400th Term**\nTo find the 400th term, we need to figure out which positive integer corresponds to the 400th term after removing squares and cubes.  Let's work with a slightly smaller example to illustrate the process:\n**Example:** Let's say we want to find the 20th term.\n1. **Start with a large enough number:** We know the 20th term is somewhere between the 20th and 40th positive integers.  Let's start with *n* = 40.\n2. **Count squares and cubes:**\n   * There are \u230a\u221a40\u230b = 6 perfect squares less than or equal to 40.\n   * There are \u230a\u221b40\u230b = 3 perfect cubes less than or equal to 40.\n   * There's one number (64) that's both a square and a cube, so we've double-counted it. \n   * Total numbers removed: 6 + 3 - 1 = 8\n3. **Check:** 40 - 8 = 32. Since we've removed 8 numbers from the first 40 positive integers, the 20th term in our sequence is the 32nd positive integer, which is 32.\n**Now, let's find the 400th term:**\n1. **Starting point:** We need to choose a starting value *n* that's likely to be larger than the 400th term. Since the sequence grows faster than the squares and cubes, let's start with *n* = 500.\n2. **Counting squares and cubes:**\n   * \u230a\u221a500\u230b \u2248 22.36, so there are 22 perfect squares.\n   * \u230a\u221b500\u230b \u2248 7.94, so there are 7 perfect cubes.\n   * The largest sixth power less than 500 is 6\u2074 = 1296, which is too big. So, no numbers are both squares and cubes in this range.\n   * Total numbers removed: 22 + 7 = 29\n3. **Adjusting:** 500 - 29 = 471. This means the 400th term in our sequence is somewhere between the 400th and 471st positive integers. Let's try a smaller starting value, like *n* = 470.\n4. **Repeating:**\n   * \u230a\u221a470\u230b \u2248 21.68, so there are 21 perfect squares.\n   * \u230a\u221b470\u230b \u2248 7.76, so there are 7 perfect cubes.\n   * Total numbers removed: 21 + 7 = 28\n5. **Final Check:** 470 - 28 = 442.  The 400th term is somewhere between the 400th and 442nd positive integers.  Since we're removing numbers from our sequence, we know the 400th term will be greater than 400.\n**Therefore, the 400th term in the sequence is 401.** \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem:\n**1. Understanding the Pattern**\nThe sequence consists of all positive integers that are *not* perfect squares or perfect cubes.  Let's analyze why this is:\n* **Squares:** 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ... are all perfect squares. \n* **Cubes:** 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, ... are all perfect cubes.\nNotice that the numbers 1 and 8 are both squares and cubes.  The sequence excludes these numbers.\n**2. Finding a Formula**\nTo find the 400th term, we need a way to count how many numbers are excluded before reaching it.  Let's consider the number of squares and cubes up to a certain point:\n* **Squares:** The largest perfect square less than or equal to a number *n* is the floor of the square root of *n* (denoted as  \u230a\u221an\u230b). \n* **Cubes:** The largest perfect cube less than or equal to a number *n* is the floor of the cube root of *n* (denoted as \u230a\u221bn\u230b).\n**3. Finding the Number of Excluded Values**\nTo find the 400th term, we need to figure out how many numbers we've excluded up to that point.  Let's think about how many squares and cubes are less than or equal to a given number.\n* **Squares:**  There are \u230a\u221an\u230b perfect squares less than or equal to *n*.\n* **Cubes:** There are \u230a\u221bn\u230b perfect cubes less than or equal to *n*.\n**4. Accounting for Overlap**\nWe've counted the number 1 twice (as both a square and a cube). To get the correct number of excluded values, we need to subtract 1:\n* Total excluded values = (\u230a\u221an\u230b + \u230a\u221bn\u230b) - 1\n**5. Finding the 400th Term**\nWe need to find the smallest *n* for which the total number of excluded values is 399 (because we're looking for the 400th term in the sequence).\nIn other words, we need to solve the inequality:\n(\u230a\u221an\u230b + \u230a\u221bn\u230b) - 1 \u2264 399 \nWe can start by testing some values of *n*.  Since we're looking for a large number, it's a good idea to use a calculator:\n* If *n* = 1600, then \u230a\u221an\u230b = 40 and \u230a\u221bn\u230b = 11.  So, (\u230a\u221an\u230b + \u230a\u221bn\u230b) - 1 = 50.\n* If *n* = 1681, then \u230a\u221an\u230b = 41 and \u230a\u221bn\u230b = 11. So, (\u230a\u221an\u230b + \u230a\u221bn\u230b) - 1 = 51.\nSince we want the *smallest* *n* that gives us 399 excluded values, we know the 400th term must lie between 1600 and 1681.\n**6. Final Step**\nWe can continue testing values between 1600 and 1681. We find that when *n* = 1601, (\u230a\u221an\u230b + \u230a\u221bn\u230b) - 1 = 399. Therefore, the 400th term of the sequence is **1601**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understanding the Pattern**\nThe sequence consists of positive integers that are *not* perfect squares or perfect cubes. This means we need to figure out how many numbers are skipped due to being squares or cubes.\n**2. Counting Squares and Cubes**\n* **Squares:** The number of perfect squares less than or equal to a given number *n* is roughly the square root of *n*. \n* **Cubes:** Similarly, the number of perfect cubes less than or equal to *n* is roughly the cube root of *n*.\n**3. Finding the 400th Term**\n* **Estimating:**  Since we're looking for the 400th term, let's estimate the size of the number. We know there are approximately \u221a400 = 20 squares and \u221b400 \u2248 7 cubes less than 400. This means we've skipped about 27 numbers. So, the 400th term in the sequence should be around 400 + 27 = 427.\n* **Checking:**  Let's check if 427 is a square or a cube. It's not. The next perfect square is 441 (21\u00b2) and the next perfect cube is 512 (8\u00b3). So, 427 is indeed in the sequence.\n**4. Final Answer**\nThe 400th term of the sequence is **427**. \n"
