    "solution": "With no restriction, the president can be any of the $25$ members, the secretary can be any of the $25$ remaining members, and the treasurer can be any of the remaining $25$ members.\n\nIf the same member holds all three offices, it could be any of the $25$ members, so there are $25$ ways for this to happen. We must exclude these $25$ possibilities, so the answer is $25\\times 25\\times 25-25=\\boxed{15,600}.$",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Calculate the total number of ways to choose officers without restrictions:**\n* There are 25 choices for president.\n* After choosing the president, there are 24 choices left for secretary.\n* After choosing the president and secretary, there are 23 choices left for treasurer.\nSo, the total number of ways to choose officers without restrictions is 25 * 24 * 23 = 13,800.\n**2. Calculate the number of ways to choose officers where one person holds all three positions:**\n* There are 25 choices for the person holding all three positions.\n**3. Calculate the number of ways to choose officers where one person holds two positions:**\n* There are 25 choices for the person holding two positions.\n* They can hold president and secretary, president and treasurer, or secretary and treasurer, giving us 3 combinations.\n* For each combination, there are 24 choices for the remaining position.\nSo, the number of ways to choose officers where one person holds two positions is 25 * 3 * 24 = 1800.\n**4. Subtract the invalid cases from the total number of cases:**\nThe number of ways to choose officers where individual members are allowed to hold 2, but not all 3, offices is:\n13,800 (total cases) - 25 (one person holds all three) - 1800 (one person holds two) = **11,975** \n**Therefore, there are 11,975 ways to choose the officers with the given restrictions.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Calculate the total number of ways to choose officers without restrictions:**\n* There are 25 choices for president.\n* Once the president is chosen, there are 24 choices left for secretary.\n* Finally, there are 23 choices left for treasurer.\nSo, the total number of ways to choose officers without restrictions is 25 * 24 * 23 = 13,800.\n**2. Calculate the number of ways to choose officers where one member holds all three positions:**\n* There are 25 choices for the member who holds all three positions.\n**3. Calculate the number of ways to choose officers where one member holds two positions:**\n* There are 25 choices for the member who holds two positions.\n* For the remaining position, there are 24 choices left.\nSo, the number of ways to choose officers where one member holds two positions is 25 * 24 = 600.\n**4. Subtract the invalid combinations from the total:**\n* The total number of ways to choose officers where one member holds all three positions or two positions is 25 + 600 = 625.\n**5. Final Calculation:**\nThe number of ways to choose officers where individual members are allowed to hold 2, but not all 3, offices is:\n13,800 - 625 = **13,175** \n",

Calculate the total number of ways to choose officers without restrictions:**\n* There are 25 choices for president.\n* Once the president is chosen, there are 24 choices for secretary.\n* Finally, there are 23 choices for treasurer.\nThis gives us a total of 25 * 24 * 23 = 13,800 ways to choose officers without any restrictions.\n**2. Calculate the number of ways to choose officers where one person holds all three positions:**\n* There are 25 ways to choose the person who holds all three positions.\n**3. Calculate the number of ways to choose officers where one person holds two positions:**\n* There are 25 ways to choose the person who will hold two positions.\n* Then, there are 24 ways to choose the remaining position (since they can't hold all three).\n* However, we've overcounted because we've counted each combination twice (once for each position the person holds).  \n* Therefore, there are (25 * 24)/2 = 300 ways to choose officers where one person holds two positions.\n**4.  Subtract the invalid cases from the total:**\nThe number of valid ways to choose officers is:\n13,800 (total ways) - 25 (all three positions) - 300 (two positions) = **13,475** \n**Therefore, there are 13,475 ways to choose the officers with the given restrictions.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Total Possible Arrangements Without Restrictions**\n* If there were no restrictions, we would have 25 choices for president, 24 for secretary (since one person is already president), and 23 for treasurer.\n* This gives us a total of 25 * 24 * 23 = 13,800 possible arrangements.\n**2. Arrangements Where One Person Holds All Three Offices**\n* We need to subtract the number of arrangements where one person holds all three offices.  \n* There are 25 ways to choose this person.\n**3. Arrangements Where One Person Holds Two Offices**\n* We need to subtract the number of arrangements where one person holds two offices. \n* **Choose the two offices:** There are 3C2 = 3 ways to choose which two offices the person will hold (president/secretary, president/treasurer, or secretary/treasurer).\n* **Choose the person:** There are 25 ways to choose the person who will hold these two offices.\n* **Choose the remaining office:** There are 24 ways to choose the person who will hold the remaining office.\n* This gives us 3 * 25 * 24 = 1800 arrangements where one person holds two offices.\n**4. Final Calculation**\nTo get the final answer, we subtract the arrangements we don't want from the total number of arrangements:\n13,800 (total arrangements) - 25 (all three offices) - 1800 (two offices) = **11,975**\n**Therefore, there are 11,975 ways to choose the officers with the given restrictions.** \n",
