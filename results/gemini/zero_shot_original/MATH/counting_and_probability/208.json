    "solution": "The number of possible rolls of 5 dice is $6^5$, since there are 6 possibilities for each of the 5 dice.  Now we count the number of ways to get a 1 or a 2 in exactly 3 of the 5 rolls. First, we pick which 3 of the 5 rolls are 1 or 2: we can do that in $\\binom{5}{3}$ ways.  Now for each of these 3 rolls, there are 2 choices, and for each of the other 2 rolls, there are 4 choices.  Thus the probability is \\[\\frac{\\binom{5}{3}2^34^2}{6^5}=\\boxed{\\frac{40}{243}}.\\]",

        "Here's how to break down the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Favorable Outcomes**\n* We want exactly 3 rolls to be either a 1 or a 2. \n* There are two successful outcomes for each of these rolls (1 or 2).\n* We need to figure out how many ways we can get 3 successes out of 5 trials. This is a combination problem, as the order of the rolls doesn't matter. \n**2.  Calculating Combinations**\n* The number of ways to choose 3 successes out of 5 trials is given by the combination formula:  \u2075C\u2083 = 5! / (3! * 2!) = 10\n**3.  Probability of a Single Favorable Outcome**\n* The probability of getting a 1 or a 2 on a single roll is 2/6 = 1/3.\n* The probability of getting 3 successes and 2 failures in a specific sequence (like 1, 2, 1, 5, 6) is (1/3)\u00b3 * (2/3)\u00b2 = 4/243.\n**4.  Total Probability**\n* Since there are 10 different ways to get 3 successes out of 5 trials, the total probability is:\n   10 * (4/243) = **40/243** \n**Therefore, the probability of getting exactly 3 rolls of either a 1 or a 2 in 5 rolls is 40/243.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Probability of a Successful Roll**\n* A successful roll is either a 1 or a 2. \n* There are 2 successful outcomes (1 or 2) and 6 total possible outcomes.\n* The probability of a successful roll is 2/6 = 1/3\n**2.  Probability of a Failed Roll**\n* A failed roll is anything other than a 1 or a 2.\n* There are 4 failed outcomes (3, 4, 5, or 6) and 6 total possible outcomes.\n* The probability of a failed roll is 4/6 = 2/3\n**3.  Choosing the 3 Successful Rolls**\n* We need to choose 3 successful rolls out of 5.  \n* This is a combination problem, as the order we roll the successful numbers doesn't matter.\n* The number of ways to choose 3 successful rolls is  \u2075C\u2083 = (5!)/(3!2!) = 10\n**4.  Choosing the 2 Failed Rolls**\n* Similarly, we need to choose 2 failed rolls out of 5.\n* The number of ways to choose 2 failed rolls is \u2075C\u2082 = (5!)/(2!3!) = 10\n**5.  Putting it Together**\n* The probability of getting exactly 3 successful rolls (1 or 2) in 5 rolls is:\n (Probability of a successful roll)\u00b3 * (Probability of a failed roll)\u00b2 * (Number of ways to choose 3 successful rolls) * (Number of ways to choose 2 failed rolls)\n= (1/3)\u00b3 * (2/3)\u00b2 * 10 * 10\n= 80/243\n**Therefore, the probability of getting exactly 3 rolls of 1 or 2 in 5 rolls is 80/243.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this step-by-step:\n**1. Probability of a successful roll:**\n* A successful roll is either a 1 or a 2. \n* There are 2 successful outcomes (1 or 2) out of 6 possible outcomes.\n* The probability of a successful roll is 2/6 = 1/3.\n**2. Probability of an unsuccessful roll:**\n* An unsuccessful roll is any number other than 1 or 2.\n* There are 4 unsuccessful outcomes (3, 4, 5, or 6) out of 6 possible outcomes.\n* The probability of an unsuccessful roll is 4/6 = 2/3.\n**3.  Possible combinations:**\n* We need exactly 3 successful rolls and 2 unsuccessful rolls.\n*  Think of this as a sequence like \"SSSFF\" (S = success, F = failure)\n* We need to figure out how many ways we can arrange 3 S's and 2 F's. This is a combination problem.\n**4. Using Combinations:**\n* The number of ways to choose 3 successful rolls out of 5 is  \u2075C\u2083 = 5!/(3!2!) = 10.\n* This represents the number of different sequences like \"SSSFF\", \"SSFFS\", etc.\n**5. Calculating the total probability:**\n* For each successful sequence, the probability is: (1/3)\u00b3 * (2/3)\u00b2 = 4/243 \n* Since there are 10 possible sequences, the total probability is: 10 * (4/243) = **40/243**\n**Therefore, the probability of getting exactly 3 rolls of 1 or 2 in 5 rolls of a fair die is 40/243.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Probability of getting a 1 or a 2 on a single roll:**\n* There are 2 favorable outcomes (rolling a 1 or a 2).\n* There are 6 total possible outcomes.\n* Probability of getting a 1 or a 2: 2/6 = 1/3\n**2. Probability of getting exactly 3 \"1 or 2\" rolls in 5 trials:**\n* We need to consider the combinations of getting 3 successes (1 or 2) and 2 failures (3, 4, 5, or 6).\n* We can use the binomial probability formula:\n   P(exactly k successes in n trials) = (n choose k) * p^k * q^(n-k)\n   Where:\n     * n = number of trials (5 in this case)\n     * k = number of successes (3 in this case)\n     * p = probability of success on a single trial (1/3)\n     * q = probability of failure on a single trial (2/3)\n     * (n choose k) = the binomial coefficient, representing the number of ways to choose k items from a set of n items. It's calculated as n! / (k! * (n-k)!).\n**3. Calculate the binomial coefficient:**\n* (5 choose 3) = 5! / (3! * 2!) = 10\n**4. Plug the values into the formula:**\n* P(exactly 3 successes) = 10 * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^2\n* P(exactly 3 successes) = 10 * (1/27) * (4/9)\n* P(exactly 3 successes) = 40/243\n**Therefore, the probability of getting exactly 3 rolls of a 1 or a 2 in 5 rolls of a fair die is 40/243.** \n",
