    "solution": "The prime factorization of $2310$ is $2310 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11.$ Therefore, we have the equation \\[ abc = 2310 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11,\\]where $a, b, c$ must be distinct positive integers and order does not matter. There are $3$ ways to assign each prime number on the right-hand side to one of the variables $a, b, c,$ which gives $3^5 = 243$ solutions for $(a, b, c).$ However, three of these solutions have two $1$s and one $2310,$ which contradicts the fact that $a, b, c$ must be distinct. Because each prime factor appears only once, all other solutions have $a, b, c$ distinct. Correcting for this, we get $243 - 3 = 240$ ordered triples $(a, b, c)$ where $a, b, c$ are all distinct.\n\nFinally, since order does not matter, we must divide by $3!,$ the number of ways to order $a, b, c.$ This gives the final answer, \\[\\frac{240}{3!} = \\frac{240}{6} = \\boxed{40}.\\]",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Prime Factorization:**\n* Find the prime factorization of 2310:  \n   2310 = 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 11\n**2.  Forming Sets:**\n* Since we need distinct positive integers, we need to distribute these prime factors among three elements.  \n* Notice that we can't have any elements equal to 1, as that would not give us distinct positive integers.\n* We can't have one element be the product of all five primes, as then the other two elements would have to be 1.\n**3.  Counting the Sets:**\n* **Case 1:** Two elements are prime numbers, and the third element is the product of the remaining three primes. There are  \u2075C\u2082 = 10 ways to choose two primes from the five.\n* **Case 2:** One element is the product of two primes, and the other two elements are each prime. There are  \u2075C\u2082 = 10 ways to choose two primes, and then 3 ways to choose which of the two primes will be the product of the other two primes. \n* **Case 3:**  One element is the product of three primes, and the other two elements are each prime. There are \u2075C\u2083 = 10 ways to choose three primes.\n**4. Total Sets:**\n* In total, there are 10 + 10 \u00d7 3 + 10 = **50** three-element sets. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Prime Factorization:**\n* Start by finding the prime factorization of 2310:  \n   2310 = 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 11\n**2. Grouping the Factors:**\n* Since we need three distinct positive integers, we need to group these prime factors into three groups.  \n**3. Counting the Possibilities:**\n* **Group 1:** We have several choices for the first group:\n    * {2}\n    * {3}\n    * {5}\n    * {7}\n    * {11}\n* **Group 2:** Once we've chosen Group 1, the remaining factors must be combined into two groups.  For example, if Group 1 is {2}, then Group 2 could be {3, 5} or {7, 11}. We have 4 choices for Group 2.\n* **Group 3:** The remaining factors automatically form Group 3.\n**4. Avoiding Overcounting:**\n* Notice that we've overcounted the possibilities. For example, we counted {2, 3, 5 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 11} and {3, 2, 5 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 11} as different sets. Since the order of the elements in a set doesn't matter, we need to divide by 3! (3 factorial, which is 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 6) to correct for this overcounting.\n**5. Calculation:**\n* The total number of ways to group the prime factors is 5 choices for Group 1 \u00d7 4 choices for Group 2 = 20.\n* After correcting for overcounting, we have 20 / 6 = **10/3**.  Since this is not a whole number, we know we've made a mistake somewhere.\n**The mistake:** We didn't account for the fact that the prime factors can be arranged in different ways. For example, we counted {2, 3, 5 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 11} as different from {2, 5 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 11, 3}.  \n**6.  Correcting for Overcounting:**\n* We need to account for the 3! (3 factorial) ways to arrange the three groups. This means our final calculation is:\n  * (5 choices for Group 1 \u00d7 4 choices for Group 2) / (3! ways to arrange groups) = (20) / 6 = **10/3** \n**Conclusion:** There are **10/3** ways to create three-element sets of positive integers whose product is 2310.  Since we can't have a fraction of a set, this means there are **no** three-element sets that satisfy the given conditions. \n",

Forming Sets:**\n* Since we want distinct positive integers, we need to group the prime factors into three sets. \n* We have five prime factors, so each set must have at least one prime factor. \n**3.  Counting the Possibilities:**\n* **Case 1:** One set has three factors, the other two have one each.  There are 5 ways to choose the three factors for the larger set (2, 3, 5; 2, 3, 7; 2, 3, 11;  2, 5, 7; 2, 5, 11; ...). Then there are 2 ways to arrange the remaining two factors.  This gives us 5 \u00d7 2 = 10 possibilities.\n* **Case 2:**  Two sets have two factors each, and the remaining set has one factor. There are  \u2075C\u2082 = 10 ways to choose the two factors for one of the sets with two factors.  Then there are \u2083C\u2082 = 3 ways to choose the two factors for the other set with two factors.  Finally, there's only one way to choose the remaining factor.  This gives us 10 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 1 = 30 possibilities.\n**4.

Avoiding Overcounting**\n* Notice that the order we choose the sets in doesn't matter.  For example, choosing {2, 3} then {5} then {7, 11} is the same as choosing {5} then {2, 3} then {7, 11}.  We've overcounted by a factor of 3! (3 factorial, or 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 6).\n**5.  Calculation**\n* We have 10 ways to form the first set, and we overcounted by a factor of 6.  Therefore, there are 10 / 6 = **5/3** distinct three-element sets.
