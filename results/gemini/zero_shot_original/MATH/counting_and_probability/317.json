    "problem": "In how many ways can we seat 6 people around a round table if Fred and Gwen insist on sitting opposite each other?  (Two seatings are considered equivalent if one is a rotation of the other.)",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are 6 choices of seats for Fred to sit in.  Once Fred is seated, then Gwen must sit opposite him.  This leaves 4 people to place in the four remaining seats, which can be done in $4!$ ways.  However, we must divide by 6 to account for the 6 rotations of the table.  So the number of arrangements is $\\dfrac{6 \\times 1 \\times 4!}{6} = 4! = \\boxed{24}$.  Alternatively, we could start by fixing the table around Fred, thus removing the rotation.  There is 1 option for Gwen's seat, since she must sit across from him.  This leaves 4 people to place in four unique seats, so the number of arrangements is $4! = \\boxed{24}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Fix Fred's Position:**\n* Since rotations are considered equivalent, we can fix Fred in any position. Let's say he sits at the \"top\" of the table.\n**2. Place Gwen:**\n* Gwen must sit opposite Fred, so she has only one possible position.\n**3. Place the Remaining People:**\n* Now we have 4 remaining people to seat.  They can be arranged in 4! (4 factorial) ways, which is 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24.\n**Therefore, there are a total of 24 ways to seat the 6 people around the table with Fred and Gwen sitting opposite each other.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Fix Fred's Position**\nSince we're dealing with a circular table, we can fix Fred's position without loss of generality. Let's place Fred at a specific spot.\n**2. Place Gwen**\nGwen must sit opposite Fred. There's only **one** way to do this.\n**3. Place the Remaining People**\nNow we have 4 remaining people to seat. We can place them in any order. The first person has 4 choices, the second has 3 choices, and so on. \n**4. Account for Rotations**\nSince we're dealing with a circular table, any rotation of a particular seating arrangement is considered the same.  To correct for this overcounting, we need to divide by the number of possible rotations.  Since there are 6 people, there are 6 possible rotations.\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Arrangements**\nPutting it all together, the total number of arrangements is:\n(4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / 6 = 24 / 6 = 4\n**Therefore, there are 4 ways to seat 6 people around a round table if Fred and Gwen insist on sitting opposite each other.** \n",

Place the Remaining People**\nNow we have 4 remaining people to seat.  We can place them in any order. \n* For the next seat, there are 4 choices.\n* For the seat after that, there are 3 choices.\n*  For the next seat, there are 2 choices.\n*  For the last seat, there's only 1 choice left.\n**4. Account for Rotations**\nSince rotations are considered equivalent, we've overcounted our arrangements. We've counted each distinct arrangement 6 times (once for each possible starting position).\n**5. Calculate the Final Result**\nThe total number of ways to seat the 6 people is:\n(4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / 6 = 24 / 6 = **4**\n**Therefore, there are 4 ways to seat the 6 people around the table with Fred and Gwen sitting opposite each other.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Fix Fred's Position**\nSince we're dealing with a round table, we can fix Fred's position without loss of generality. Let's place Fred at any arbitrary spot.\n**2. Place Gwen**\nGwen must sit opposite Fred. There's only one spot opposite Fred.\n**3. Place the Remaining People**\nNow, we have 4 remaining people to place. They can be arranged in the remaining 4 seats in 4! ways.\n**4. Account for Rotations**\nSince we're dealing with a round table, rotating everyone by one position results in the same arrangement. Therefore, we need to divide our previous result by the number of possible rotations, which is 6 (the number of people).\n**Final Calculation**\nThe total number of ways to seat the people is:\n(4! / 6) = (24 / 6) = **4**\n**Therefore, there are 4 ways to seat the 6 people around the table if Fred and Gwen insist on sitting opposite each other.** \n",

Place the Remaining People:**\n* We have 4 remaining people to seat. \n* There are 4 choices for the seat to the right of Fred.\n* Once that seat is filled, there are 3 choices for the seat to the right of that one.\n* This continues until all 4 remaining seats are filled.\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Arrangements:**\n* The total number of ways to arrange the remaining 4 people is 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24.\n**5. Account for Overcounting:**\n* Notice that we've overcounted the arrangements.  If we rotate the table, we get the same relative seating arrangement.  Since there are 6 seats, we've counted each arrangement 6 times.\n**6. Final Calculation:**\n* Divide the number of arrangements we calculated by 6: 24 / 6 = 4.\n**Therefore, there are 4 ways to seat 6 people around a round table if Fred and Gwen insist on sitting opposite each other.** \n"
