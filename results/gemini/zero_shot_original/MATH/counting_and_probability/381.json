    "solution": "There are a total of $2^6=64$ equally likely sequences of heads and tails coin flips.  Each toss corresponds to a movement clockwise or counterclockwise, so each sequence of coin tosses corresponds to a sequence of six movements, $L$ or $R$.  If the man gets six consecutive heads or tails, corresponding to $RRRRRR$ or $LLLLLL$, then he will return to the starting point.  But, the man could also flip three heads and three tails in some order, corresponding to a sequence like $RRLRLL$.  There are a total of $\\binom{6}{3}=20$ sequences of moves that include three moves counterclockwise, and three clockwise.

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Problem**\nImagine a hexagon with the man starting at one corner.  Each coin flip determines whether he moves one vertex counterclockwise (heads) or clockwise (tails).\n**2.  Possible Outcomes**\nTo return to the starting position, the man needs to make a net movement of zero vertices.  This means the number of \"heads\" flips must equal the number of \"tails\" flips. \n**3.  Favorable Outcomes**\nThe only way to have an equal number of heads and tails in six flips is to have three heads and three tails.  Let's figure out how many ways this can happen:\n* **Think of the flips as slots:** We have six slots representing the coin flips: _ _ _ _ _ _\n* **Fill the slots:** We need to choose three of these slots to be heads.  This is a combination problem (order doesn't matter):  \u2076C\u2083 = 6!/(3!3!) = 20.  There are 20 ways to get three heads and three tails.\n**4. Total Possible Outcomes**\nEach coin flip has two possibilities (heads or tails).  With six flips, there are 2\u2076 = 64 total possible outcomes.\n**5. Probability**\nThe probability of the man ending up where he started is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes:\nProbability = 20 / 64 = **5/16** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step by step:\n**Understanding the Problem**\n* The man is essentially taking a random walk around the hexagon.\n* He needs to end up back at his starting point after six coin flips.\n* To get back to the starting point, he needs to make an equal number of clockwise and counterclockwise moves.\n**Possible Scenarios**\n* **Scenario 1: All Heads or All Tails** \n    * If all flips are heads, he'll walk counterclockwise six times and end up back where he started.\n    * Same for all tails.\n* **Scenario 2: Three Heads and Three Tails**\n    *  He needs to alternate between clockwise and counterclockwise moves.  For example: Head, Tail, Head, Tail, Head, Tail.\n**Calculating the Probability**\n1. **Scenario 1:**\n    * The probability of getting all heads is (1/2)^6 = 1/64.\n    * The probability of getting all tails is also 1/64.\n    * The total probability for Scenario 1 is (1/64) + (1/64) = 1/32.\n2. **Scenario 2:**\n    *  We need to figure out how many ways we can arrange three heads and three tails. This is a combination problem: 6 choose 3, which is written as \u2076C\u2083 or  \u2076C\u2083 = 6!/(3!3!) = 20.\n    * Each of these 20 arrangements has a probability of (1/2)^6 = 1/64.\n    * The total probability for Scenario 2 is 20 * (1/64) = 5/16.\n3. **Overall Probability:**\n    *  The probability of ending up at the starting point is the sum of the probabilities of Scenario 1 and Scenario 2: (1/32) + (5/16) = 9/32.\n**Answer:** The probability that the man is standing where he started after six coin flips is **9/32**. \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Possible Paths**\n* To end up back at the starting point after six flips, the man needs to make an equal number of clockwise and counterclockwise moves.  This means he must have three heads and three tails.\n* The order of the flips doesn't matter, as long as there are three of each. For example, HHTHTT, HTHTTH, and TTHHTH are all valid paths that lead back to the starting point.\n**2.  Calculating the Probability of One Path**\n*  Let's take the path HHTHTT as an example. The probability of this specific path is:\n    * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = (1/2)^6 = 1/64\n**3.  Counting the Total Number of Paths**\n* We need to find out how many different combinations of three heads and three tails there are. This is a classic combinatorics problem.  \n* The formula for combinations is nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!), where n is the total number of items and r is the number you choose.\n* In our case, we have 6 flips (n=6) and want to choose 3 heads (r=3). \n* So, 6C3 = 6! / (3! * 3!) = (6 * 5 * 4) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 20 \n**4.  Final Probability**\n* We have 20 possible paths that lead back to the starting point, each with a probability of 1/64.\n* The total probability of ending up back at the starting point is 20 * (1/64) = **5/16** \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem:\n**Understanding the Problem**\n* **Hexagon:** A hexagon has 6 sides and 6 vertices.\n* **Coin Flips:** Each flip determines the direction the man walks (clockwise or counterclockwise).\n* **Goal:** We want to find the probability he ends up back at his starting point after 6 flips.\n**Possible Outcomes**\nTo return to the starting point, the man needs to make an equal number of clockwise and counterclockwise moves.  Here are the only possible combinations of flips that achieve this:\n* **HHH TTT:** 3 heads, 3 tails\n* **HHT TTH:** 2 heads, 2 tails, then 2 heads, 2 tails\n* **HTH THH:** 1 head, 1 tail, alternating\n**Calculating Probabilities**\n* **HHH TTT:**  The probability of getting 3 heads and then 3 tails is (1/2)^6 = 1/64\n* **HHT TTH:**  There are 6 ways to arrange this pattern (HHT TTH, HTH HTT, etc.). Each arrangement has a probability of (1/2)^6 = 1/64.  So, the total probability of this outcome is 6 * (1/64) = 3/32\n* **HTH THH:**  There are 6 ways to arrange this pattern as well. Each arrangement has a probability of (1/2)^6 = 1/64. So, the total probability is 6 * (1/64) = 3/32\n**Adding the Probabilities**\nTo get the overall probability of the man ending up at his starting point, we add the probabilities of each possible successful outcome:\n1/64 + 3/32 + 3/32 = 7/64\n**Answer:** The probability that the man is standing where he started after six flips is **7/64**. \n",
