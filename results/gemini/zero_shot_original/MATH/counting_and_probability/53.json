    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The quickest way to solve this problem is to count the number of outomes that have three heads in a row, as we already know very clearly that there are $2^4$ outcomes total. So, HHHH, HHHT, THHH are the only 3 outcomes that have three consecutive heads. So, our answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{16}}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. List the Possible Outcomes**\nThere are 2 possibilities for each flip (heads or tails), and we're flipping 4 times, so there are 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 16 total possible outcomes.  Here's a way to list them systematically:\n* HHHH\n* HHHT\n* HHTH\n* HHTT\n* HTHH\n* HTHT\n* HTTH\n* HTTT\n* THHH\n* THHT\n* THTH\n* THTT\n* TTHH\n* TTHT\n* TTTH\n* TTTT\n**2. Identify Favorable Outcomes**\nWe want at least three heads in a row.  The favorable outcomes are:\n* **HHHH**\n* **HHHT**\n* **HHTH**\n* **THHH**\n**3. Calculate the Probability**\n* There are 4 favorable outcomes.\n* There are 16 total possible outcomes.\nThe probability of flipping at least three heads in a row is 4/16, which simplifies to **1/4**. \n",
