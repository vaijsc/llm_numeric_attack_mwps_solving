        "### Response:\nSince $x$ and $y$ are positive integers, we know that $x$ must be even.  This is because $2y$ is even, and the sum of an even number and an odd number is odd.  So we can write $x = 2k$ for some positive integer $k$.  Substituting into the equation $x + 2y = 100$, we get $2k + 2y = 100$, or $k + y = 50$.  Since $k$ and $y$ are positive integers, we can see that $k$ can take on the values 1, 2, 3, $\\dots$, 49.  This gives us $\\boxed{49}$ possible ordered pairs $(x,y)$. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step by step:\n**1.  Isolate one variable:**\n   We can rewrite the equation to solve for *x*:\n   \n   *x = 100 - 2y*\n**2.  Consider the constraints:**\n   * **x and y must be positive integers:** This means both *x* and *y* must be whole numbers greater than zero.\n**3.  Find the possible values of y:**\n   * Since *x* must be positive, 100 - 2y must be greater than 0.\n   * This means 2y < 100, and therefore y < 50.\n   * Since *y* is a positive integer, the possible values for *y* are 1, 2, 3, ..., 49.\n**4.  Count the number of possible pairs:**\n   * For each of the 49 possible values of *y*, there will be exactly one corresponding value of *x* that satisfies the equation. \n**Therefore, there are 49 ordered pairs of positive integers (x,y) that satisfy the equation x + 2y = 100.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Problem:**\nWe need to find how many pairs of positive integers (x, y) satisfy the equation x + 2y = 100.\n**2. Solve for One Variable:**\nLet's solve the equation for x:\nx = 100 - 2y\n**3. Consider Restrictions:**\n* **x must be positive:** This means 100 - 2y > 0.  Solving for y, we get y < 50.\n* **y must be positive:** This means y > 0.\n**4. Find Possible Values of y:**\nSince y must be a positive integer less than 50, the possible values for y are 1, 2, 3, ..., 49.\n**5. Count the Possibilities:**\nThere are **49** possible values for y, and each value of y will give a unique value for x. \n**Therefore, there are 49 ordered pairs (x, y) that satisfy the equation x + 2y = 100.** \n",
        "We can solve this problem by considering the possible values of $x$. Since $x$ and $y$ are positive integers, $x$ must be even (because $100-2y$ is even).  \nLet's start by trying some values of $x$:\n* **If $x = 2$,** then $2y = 98$ and $y = 49$.  \n* **If $x = 4$,** then $2y = 96$ and $y = 48$.\n* **If $x = 6$,** then $2y = 94$ and $y = 47$.\nNotice a pattern:  As $x$ increases by 2, $y$ decreases by 1. We can continue this pattern until $x$ is as large as possible.  The largest possible value for $x$ is 98 (since we need $2y$ to be a positive even number).\nSo, the possible values of $x$ are 2, 4, 6, ... , 98. This is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 2.  To find the number of terms in this sequence, we can use the formula:\n* Last term = First term + (number of terms - 1) * common difference\nSubstituting the values, we get: \n* 98 = 2 + (number of terms - 1) * 2\n* 96 = 2 * (number of terms - 1)\n* 48 = number of terms - 1\n* number of terms = 49\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{49}$ ordered pairs $(x,y)$ that satisfy the equation. \n",
