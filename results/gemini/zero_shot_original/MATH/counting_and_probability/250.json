    "problem": "A class of 25 students includes the Smith quadruplets.  The teacher must select two students from the class to represent the class in the school's student government.  Instead of holding an election, the teacher decides to choose the two representatives at random.  What is the probability that both representatives will be Smith quadruplets?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are ${25 \\choose 2} = 300$ possible pairs of student representatives. Of these, since there are 4 Smith quadruplets, there are ${4 \\choose 2} = 6$ pairs in which both representatives are Smith quadruplets. So, the probability of both representatives being Smith quadruplets is $\\frac{6}{300} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{50}}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this step-by-step:\n**1. Probability of the first student being a Smith quadruplet:**\n* There are 4 Smith quadruplets and 25 total students.\n* The probability of the first student chosen being a Smith quadruplet is 4/25.\n**2. Probability of the second student also being a Smith quadruplet (given the first was):**\n* After one Smith quadruplet is chosen, there are only 3 left and 24 total students remaining.\n* The probability of the second student also being a Smith quadruplet is 3/24.\n**3. Overall probability:**\n* To get the probability of both events happening, we multiply the probabilities together:\n(4/25) * (3/24) = 12/600 = 1/50\n**Therefore, the probability that both representatives will be Smith quadruplets is 1/50.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the total number of ways to choose two representatives:**\n* The teacher has 25 students to choose from for the first representative.\n* After choosing one, there are 24 students left to choose from for the second representative.\n* However, the order in which the teacher picks the two students doesn't matter (Smith then Jones is the same as Jones then Smith), so we need to divide by 2 to avoid overcounting.\nTherefore, the total number of ways to choose two representatives is (25 * 24) / 2 = 300.\n**2. Find the number of ways to choose two Smith quadruplets:**\n* The teacher has 4 Smith quadruplets to choose from for the first representative.\n* After choosing one, there are 3 Smith quadruplets left to choose from for the second representative.\n* Again, the order doesn't matter, so we divide by 2.\nTherefore, the number of ways to choose two Smith quadruplets is (4 * 3) / 2 = 6.\n**3. Calculate the probability:**\n* The probability of choosing two Smith quadruplets is the number of ways to choose two Smith quadruplets divided by the total number of ways to choose two representatives.\nProbability = 6 / 300 = 1/50\n**Therefore, the probability that both representatives will be Smith quadruplets is 1/50.** \n",
