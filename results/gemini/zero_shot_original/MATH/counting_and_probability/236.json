    "solution": "If 6 is one of the visible faces, the product will be divisible by 6.  If 6 is not visible, the product of the visible faces will be $1 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 4 \\times 5 = 120$, which is also divisible by 6.  Because the product is always divisible by 6, the probability is $\\boxed{1}$.",

        "Here's how to break down the problem:\n**Understanding Divisibility by 6**\nA number is divisible by 6 if it's divisible by both 2 and 3.  \n* **Divisible by 2:**  A number is divisible by 2 if it's even.\n* **Divisible by 3:**  A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.\n**Analyzing the Die**\n* **Possible Faces:**  A standard die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.\n* **Finding Evens:** At least one of the five visible faces must be even (2, 4, or 6) for the product to be even. \n* **Finding Divisibility by 3:**  To ensure the product is divisible by 3, we need at least one face that's a multiple of 3 (3 or 6).\n**Calculating the Probability**\n1. **Case 1:  The hidden face is a multiple of 3 (3 or 6).**\n    * In this case, the product of the visible faces will always be divisible by 6 (it's even and a multiple of 3). \n    * The probability of this case is 2/6 = 1/3.\n2. **Case 2: The hidden face is not a multiple of 3 (1, 2, 4, or 5).**\n    * For the product to be divisible by 6, we need at least one of the visible faces to be both even and a multiple of 3 (which is only the number 6).\n    * The probability of this is 1/5 (since there are 5 visible faces).\n**Combining the Cases**\n* The probability of Case 1 happening is 1/3.\n* The probability of Case 2 happening AND the product being divisible by 6 is (1/3) * (1/5) = 1/15.\n**Final Calculation**\nSince these two cases are mutually exclusive (they can't both happen at the same time), we add the probabilities together:\n1/3 + 1/15 = 6/15 = **2/5**\n**Therefore, the probability that the product of the numbers on the five visible faces is divisible by 6 is 2/5.** \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**Understanding Divisibility by 6**\nA number is divisible by 6 if it's divisible by both 2 and 3.  \n* **Divisible by 2:**  A number is divisible by 2 if it's even.\n* **Divisible by 3:** A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.\n**Analyzing the Die**\n* **Even Numbers:** A die has three even numbers (2, 4, 6).\n* **Numbers Divisible by 3:** A die has two numbers divisible by 3 (3, 6). \n**Possible Scenarios**\nTo have a product divisible by 6, we need at least one even number and one number divisible by 3. Let's consider the possibilities:\n1. **One Even, One Divisible by 3:**  This is the most straightforward case. For example, if the bottom face is a 1, we could have (2, 3, 4, 5, 6) or (2, 3, 4, 6, 5), and so on.  There will be many combinations here.\n2. **Two Even Numbers, One Divisible by 3:** This also works.  For example, if the bottom face is a 1, we could have (2, 4, 6, 3, 5).\n3. **Two Divisible by 3, One Even:** This also works. For example, if the bottom face is a 2, we could have (3, 6, 1, 4, 5).\n**Calculating the Probability**\n1. **Total Possible Outcomes:**  There are 6 possible outcomes for the bottom face of the die.\n2. **Unfavorable Outcomes:** The only way the product *won't* be divisible by 6 is if the bottom face is a 5. This is because you would have no even numbers and no numbers divisible by 3 in the visible faces.\n3. **Favorable Outcomes:**  Therefore, there are 5 favorable outcomes (any number except 5).\n4. **Probability:**  The probability of the product being divisible by 6 is: (Favorable Outcomes) / (Total Possible Outcomes) = 5/6.\n**Answer:** The probability that the product of the numbers on the five visible faces is divisible by 6 is **5/6**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**Understanding the Requirements**\n* **Divisibility by 6:**  A number is divisible by 6 if it's divisible by both 2 and 3.\n* **Hidden Face:**  We don't know the value of the bottom face, but it doesn't affect the product of the visible faces.\n**Analyzing the Visible Faces**\n* **Divisibility by 2:** For the product to be divisible by 2, at least one of the visible faces must be even.  Since there are three even numbers on a die (2, 4, 6), the probability of this happening is very high.\n* **Divisibility by 3:** For the product to be divisible by 3, at least one of the visible faces must be a multiple of 3.  There are two multiples of 3 on a die (3, 6). \n**Calculating the Probability**\n1. **Probability of NOT being divisible by 2:** The only way the product wouldn't be divisible by 2 is if all five visible faces are odd.  The probability of this is (3/6) * (2/5) * (1/4) = 1/20.\n2. **Probability of being divisible by 2:**  Therefore, the probability of the product being divisible by 2 (and thus having at least one even number) is 1 - (1/20) = 19/20.\n3. **Probability of NOT being divisible by 3:** The only way the product wouldn't be divisible by 3 is if none of the five visible faces are multiples of 3. The probability of this is (4/6) * (3/5) * (2/4) * (1/3) = 1/15.\n4. **Probability of being divisible by 3:** Therefore, the probability of the product being divisible by 3 (and thus having at least one multiple of 3) is 1 - (1/15) = 14/15.\n**Final Calculation**\nTo find the probability that the product is divisible by BOTH 2 and 3, we multiply the individual probabilities:\n(19/20) * (14/15) = **133/150**\n**Therefore, the probability that the product of the numbers on the five visible faces is divisible by 6 is 133/150.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step by step:\n**Understanding the Problem**\n* We need to find the probability that the product of the numbers on the five visible faces of a die is divisible by 6.\n* A number is divisible by 6 if it's divisible by both 2 and 3.\n**Analyzing Divisibility**\n* **Divisibility by 2:** A number is divisible by 2 if it's even.  The die has three even numbers (2, 4, 6). \n* **Divisibility by 3:** A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.  The die has two numbers divisible by 3 (3, 6).\n**Finding Favorable Outcomes**\nTo get a product divisible by 6, we need at least one even number and one number divisible by 3.  Let's consider the possibilities:\n* **Case 1: The hidden face is an even number (2, 4, or 6).**  \n   *  In this case, the product of the visible faces will always be even.  We also need a visible face that's divisible by 3. This will always be true since we're removing one of the even numbers, leaving the other two (3 and 6) visible.\n* **Case 2: The hidden face is an odd number (1, 3, or 5).** \n   * We need to have at least one even number visible. This is always true since there are three even numbers on the die. We also need a visible number divisible by 3. This will always be true since the number 6 is always visible in this case.\n**Calculating Probability**\n* **Favorable outcomes:**  All six possible hidden faces lead to a product divisible by 6.\n* **Total outcomes:** There are six possible faces that could be hidden.\n**Therefore, the probability that the product of the numbers on the five visible faces is divisible by 6 is 6/6 = 1.** \n**In other words, the product will always be divisible by 6.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Understanding Divisibility by 6**\n   A number is divisible by 6 if it's divisible by both 2 and 3.\n**2.  Possible Products**\n   * To be divisible by 2, at least one of the five visible faces must be even.\n   * To be divisible by 3, either:\n      * One of the visible faces is a 3, or\n      * Two of the visible faces add up to a multiple of 3.\n**3.  Analyzing Cases**\n   Let's consider the different cases:\n   * **Case 1: One visible face is a 3** \n      * In this case, the product will always be divisible by 3.  We need to consider whether the other four faces can make the product even.  Since there are three even numbers on a die (2, 4, 6), at least one of these will be visible, making the product even. This case works.\n   * **Case 2: No visible face is a 3, but two faces add up to a multiple of 3**\n      * The only possible pairs adding to a multiple of 3 are (1, 2), (1, 5), (2, 4), and (4, 5).  Since each die has only one of these pairs, only one of these pairs can be visible. \n      * To make the product divisible by 6, at least one of the remaining three visible faces must be even. This will always be the case since there are at least two even numbers on the die that won't be part of the pair. This case also works.\n**4.  Calculating Probability**\n   Since both Case 1 and Case 2 always result in a product divisible by 6, and these cases cover all possible scenarios, the probability of getting a product divisible by 6 is **1 (or 100%)**. \n"
