    "solution": "The sum of the three integers on the drawn balls is 15 minus the sum of the integers on the two balls that were left behind.  Therefore, we are looking for the probability that the two balls that were left behind sum to an even number.  There are $\\binom{5}{2}$ ways to choose these two balls.  Their sum is even only if they are both even or both odd.  The probability they are both even is $\\frac{1}{10}$ and the probability that they are both odd is $\\frac{3}{10}$.  In total, the probability that their sum is even is $\\frac{1}{10}+\\frac{3}{10}=\\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\n* We have five balls numbered 1 through 5.\n* We're drawing three balls without putting them back in (without replacement).\n* We want the probability that the sum of the numbers on the three balls is odd.\n**2.  Possible Scenarios for an Odd Sum**\nTo get an odd sum, we need one of these scenarios:\n* **Odd + Odd + Odd = Odd**\n* **Odd + Even + Even = Odd**\n**3. Calculating Probabilities**\n* **Scenario 1: Odd + Odd + Odd**\n    * Probability of drawing an odd ball first: 3/5 (three odd balls out of five)\n    * Probability of drawing another odd ball (without replacement): 2/4 (two odd balls left out of four)\n    * Probability of drawing a third odd ball: 1/3 (one odd ball left out of three)\n    * Probability of Scenario 1: (3/5) * (2/4) * (1/3) = 1/10\n* **Scenario 2: Odd + Even + Even**\n    * Probability of drawing an odd ball first: 3/5\n    * Probability of drawing an even ball: 2/4\n    * Probability of drawing another even ball: 1/3\n    * Probability of Scenario 2: (3/5) * (2/4) * (1/3) = 1/10\n**4. Total Probability**\nSince these scenarios are mutually exclusive (they can't both happen at the same time), we add the probabilities together:\n1/10 + 1/10 = 2/10 \n**5. Simplifying**\nThe probability can be simplified to **1/5**.\n**Therefore, the probability that the sum of the three integers on the balls is odd is 1/5.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Consider the possibilities for the sum:**\n* **Odd + Odd + Odd = Odd**\n* **Odd + Even + Even = Odd**\n* **Even + Odd + Even = Odd**\n* **Even + Even + Odd = Odd**\n* **Even + Even + Even = Even**\n**2.  Determine the favorable outcomes:**\nWe need the sum to be odd. This can happen in four ways (listed above).\n**3. Calculate the probability of each favorable outcome:**\n* **Odd + Odd + Odd:** There are 3 odd numbers (1, 3, 5). The probability of drawing an odd number first is 3/5. Then, there are only 2 odd numbers left out of 4 total, so the probability of drawing another odd number is 2/4. Finally, the probability of drawing a third odd number is 1/3.  The probability of this outcome is (3/5)(2/4)(1/3) = 1/10.\n* **Odd + Even + Even:** There are 3 odd numbers and 2 even numbers.  The probability of this outcome is (3/5)(2/4)(1/3) = 1/10.\n* **Even + Odd + Even:** The probability of this outcome is also (2/5)(3/4)(1/3) = 1/10.\n* **Even + Even + Odd:** The probability of this outcome is also (2/5)(1/4)(3/3) = 1/10.\n**4. Add the probabilities of the favorable outcomes:**\nThe total probability of getting an odd sum is (1/10) + (1/10) + (1/10) + (1/10) = **2/5**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Determine the total possible outcomes:**\n* We're choosing 3 balls out of 5, so the total number of combinations is  \u2075C\u2083 = (5*4*3)/(3*2*1) = 10.\n**2. Determine the outcomes where the sum is odd:**\n* **Case 1:**  One odd, two even. \n    * There are 3 odd balls and 2 even balls.  We need to choose 1 odd and 2 even. This can be done in \u00b3C\u2081 * \u00b2C\u2082 = 3 ways.\n* **Case 2:** Three odd balls.\n    * This can be done in \u00b3C\u2083 = 1 way.\n**3. Calculate the probability:**\n* The probability of the sum being odd is the number of successful outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes.\n* Probability = (3 + 1) / 10 = **4/10 = 2/5** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Understanding the Problem**\nWe need to find the probability of getting an odd sum when drawing three balls from a jar containing balls numbered 1 through 5.\n**2.  Possible Scenarios for an Odd Sum**\nAn odd sum can be achieved in two ways:\n* **Odd + Odd + Odd = Odd**\n* **Odd + Even + Even = Odd**\n**3.  Calculating Probabilities**\n* **Case 1: Odd + Odd + Odd** \n   - There are 3 odd numbers (1, 3, 5) and 2 even numbers (2, 4) in the jar.\n   - The probability of drawing an odd number on the first draw is 3/5.\n   - After removing one odd ball, the probability of drawing another odd number on the second draw is 2/4.\n   - Finally, the probability of drawing a third odd number is 1/3.\n   - The probability of Case 1 is (3/5) * (2/4) * (1/3) = 1/10\n* **Case 2: Odd + Even + Even**\n   - The probability of drawing an odd number on the first draw is 3/5.\n   - The probability of drawing an even number on the second draw is 2/4.\n   - The probability of drawing another even number on the third draw is 1/3.\n   - The probability of Case 2 is (3/5) * (2/4) * (1/3) = 1/10\n**4.  Total Probability**\nSince either case satisfies our condition, we add the probabilities of the two cases:\n1/10 + 1/10 = 2/10 = **1/5**\n**Answer:** The probability that the sum of the three integers on the balls is odd is **1/5**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Possible Outcomes**\n* Since we're drawing three balls without replacement, the order matters. This means we need to consider permutations.\n* The total number of ways to choose 3 balls out of 5 is 5P3 = 5!/(5-3)! = 60.\n**2.  Favorable Outcomes (Odd Sum)**\nTo get an odd sum, we need either:\n* **One odd and two even numbers:**\n    *  We have 3 odd numbers (1, 3, 5) and 2 even numbers (2, 4).\n    *  The number of ways to choose one odd and two even is 3C1 * 2C2 = 3 * 1 = 3. \n    *  For each of these combinations, there are 3! = 6 ways to arrange the balls.  So there are 3 * 6 = 18 ways to get one odd and two even.\n* **Three odd numbers:**\n    *  The number of ways to choose three odd numbers is 3C3 = 1.\n    *  There are 3! = 6 ways to arrange these three balls.  So there are 1 * 6 = 6 ways to get three odd numbers.\nIn total, there are 18 + 6 = 24 ways to get an odd sum.\n**3.  Probability**\nThe probability of getting an odd sum is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes:\nProbability = 24/60 = **2/5** \n"
