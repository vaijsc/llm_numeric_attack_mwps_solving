    "problem": "Mr. Brennan has 7 boys and 4 girls in his statistics class. In how many ways can he pick 3 boys and 2 girls to give a group presentation tomorrow? (The order in which the boys and girls are chosen does not matter.)",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are 4 ways to pick the first girl and 3 ways to pick the second one; however, this counts each pair of girls twice since selecting girl A followed by girl B is the same as selecting girl B followed by girl A, so the total number of ways to pick the girls is $\\frac{4\\times3}{2}=6$. Similarly, there are 7 ways to pick the first boy, 6 ways to pick the second one, and 5 ways to pick the last one, but this counts each combination of boys 6 times since picking any of the three boys first followed by either of the other two followed by the third one will give the same triplet of boys. So the total number of ways to pick the boys is $\\frac{7\\times6\\times5}{3\\times2}=35$, and the total of number of ways to pick the students for the group presentation is $\\frac{4\\times3}{2}\\cdot \\frac{7\\times6\\times5}{3\\times2}=\\boxed{210}$",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Choosing the boys:**\n* Mr. Brennan needs to choose 3 boys out of 7. \n* The order doesn't matter, so we'll use combinations.\n* The number of ways to choose 3 boys out of 7 is  \u2087C\u2083 = (7!)/(3!4!) = 35\n**2. Choosing the girls:**\n* He needs to choose 2 girls out of 4.\n* Again, order doesn't matter.\n* The number of ways to choose 2 girls out of 4 is \u2084C\u2082 = (4!)/(2!2!) = 6\n**3. Combining the choices:**\n* To get the total number of ways to choose the group, we multiply the number of ways to choose boys by the number of ways to choose girls.\n* Total combinations: 35 * 6 = 210\n**Therefore, there are 210 ways Mr. Brennan can pick a group of 3 boys and 2 girls for the presentation.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Choosing the Boys:**\n* Mr. Brennan needs to choose 3 boys out of 7. \n* This is a combination problem (order doesn't matter), and we use the formula:  \n   *  _n_C_r_ = n! / (r! * (n-r)!) \n   *  Where 'n' is the total number of items and 'r' is the number you're choosing.\n* So, the number of ways to choose 3 boys is: 7C3 = 7! / (3! * 4!) = 35\n**2. Choosing the Girls:**\n* He needs to choose 2 girls out of 4.\n* Using the same combination formula: 4C2 = 4! / (2! * 2!) = 6\n**3. Combining the Choices:**\n* For each way he can choose the boys, there are 6 ways to choose the girls.\n* To get the total number of ways to choose the group, we multiply the possibilities: 35 * 6 = 210\n**Answer:** Mr. Brennan can pick 3 boys and 2 girls for the presentation in 210 different ways. \n",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Choosing the Boys**\n* Mr. Brennan needs to choose 3 boys out of 7.  This is a combination problem because the order he chooses them doesn't matter.\n* The formula for combinations is: nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!) \n* In this case, n = 7 (total boys) and r = 3 (boys to choose).\n* So, the number of ways to choose 3 boys is 7C3 = 7! / (3! * 4!) = 35\n**2.
