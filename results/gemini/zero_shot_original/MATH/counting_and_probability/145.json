    "problem": "If two standard six-sided dice are tossed, what is the probability that a 5 is rolled on at least one of the two dice? Express your answer as a common fraction.",

    "solution": "We will use the inclusion-exclusion principle for this problem. The probability of getting a 5 on the first roll is obviously $\\frac{1}{6}$, as it is on the second roll. So, the probability of getting a 5 on at least one of the rolls would appear to be $2\\cdot \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}$. But this is not quite right. We have double counted the case of rolling a 5 twice. In that instance, we have included it in both the count for a 5 on the first roll and the second roll, when it only should have been included once overall. So, our answer is $\\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{1}{36} = \\boxed{\\frac{11}{36}}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Find the total possible outcomes:**\n* Each die has 6 sides, so there are 6 * 6 = 36 possible combinations when rolling two dice.\n**2. Find the outcomes where a 5 is NOT rolled:**\n*  There are 5 sides on each die that are not a 5. \n* This means there are 5 * 5 = 25 combinations where neither die is a 5.\n**3. Find the outcomes where a 5 IS rolled:**\n* Subtract the outcomes where a 5 is NOT rolled from the total possible outcomes: 36 - 25 = 11\n**4. Calculate the probability:**\n* The probability of rolling a 5 on at least one die is the number of successful outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes: 11/36\n**Therefore, the probability of rolling a 5 on at least one of the two dice is 11/36.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1.  Calculate the probability of NOT rolling a 5 on either die.**\n* There are 5 outcomes on each die that are not a 5 (1, 2, 3, 4, 6).\n* The probability of not rolling a 5 on one die is 5/6.\n* The probability of not rolling a 5 on both dice is (5/6) * (5/6) = 25/36.\n**2.  Calculate the probability of rolling at least one 5.**\n* The probability of rolling at least one 5 is the opposite of not rolling any 5s.\n*  Therefore, the probability is 1 - (25/36) = **11/36**. \n",
