        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Determine the Possible Numbers**\n* Gerry wakes up between 1:00 am and 3:59 am, which translates to numbers from 100 to 359.\n**2. Count the Total Number of Possibilities**\n* There are 359 - 100 + 1 = 260 possible three-digit numbers.\n**3. Find the Multiples of 7**\n* The smallest multiple of 7 within our range is 105 (7 x 15).\n* The largest multiple of 7 within our range is 357 (7 x 51).\n* To count how many multiples of 7 there are, we need to find the number of integers between 15 and 51, inclusive. This is 51 - 15 + 1 = 37. \n**4. Calculate the Probability**\n* Probability = (Favorable Outcomes) / (Total Possible Outcomes)\n* Probability of the number being divisible by 7 = 37 / 260\n**Therefore, the probability that the three-digit number Gerry reads will be divisible by 7 is 37/260.** \n",

Divisibility by 7:**\n* We need to find the numbers in this range that are divisible by 7.  We can do this by listing multiples of 7 or using a calculator.  \n**3.  Counting the Favorable Outcomes:**\n* The multiples of 7 within our range are: \n    * 105, 112, 119, ..., 357 \n* To count them more easily, we can find the first and last multiple of 7 within our range:\n    * First: 105 = 15 * 7\n    * Last: 357 = 51 * 7\n* There are 51 - 15 + 1 = 37 multiples of 7 within our range.\n**4.  Calculating the Probability:**\n* **Probability = (Favorable Outcomes) / (Total Possible Outcomes)**\n* Probability = 37 / 260  (There are 260 minutes between 1:00 am and 3:59 am)\n**Answer:** The probability that the number Gerry sees on his clock will be divisible by 7 is **37/260**. \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Determine the possible three-digit numbers:**\n* The hour can be 1 or 2, giving us a range of 100 to 259.\n**2. Calculate the total number of possible outcomes:**\n* There are 160 possible minutes between 1:00 am and 3:59 am (60 minutes * 2 hours + 40 minutes = 160). \n**3. Find the numbers divisible by 7 within the range:**\n* We need to find the multiples of 7 between 100 and 259.  The first multiple of 7 greater than 100 is 105, and the last multiple of 7 less than 259 is 252. \n* To find how many multiples of 7 there are, we can use the formula:  (Last multiple - First multiple)/7 + 1\n* In this case: (252 - 105)/7 + 1 = 22\n**4. Calculate the probability:**\n* Probability = (Favorable outcomes) / (Total possible outcomes)\n* Probability = 22 / 160 = **11/80**\n**Therefore, the probability that the three-digit number formed by the time Gerry wakes up is divisible by 7 is 11/80.** \n",
