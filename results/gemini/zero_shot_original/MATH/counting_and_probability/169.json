        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n* **Current Rows:** The triangle starts with 3 rows.\n* **Adding Rows:** We're adding 3 more rows to the bottom.\n* **Triangle Pattern:** Each row has 2 more unit triangles than the previous row.\n**Let's figure out the number of triangles in each row:**\n* **Row 1:** 3 triangles\n* **Row 2:** 5 triangles \n* **Row 3:** 7 triangles\n* **Row 4:** 9 triangles (3 + 2)\n* **Row 5:** 11 triangles (9 + 2)\n* **Row 6:** 13 triangles (11 + 2)\n**Now, let's add up all the triangles:**\n3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 = **48 unit triangles**\n**Therefore, there will be a total of 48 unit triangles after adding the three extra rows.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the pattern:**\n* The first row has 1 unit triangle.\n* The second row has 3 unit triangles (1 + 2).\n* The third row has 5 unit triangles (3 + 2).\nNotice that each row has 2 more unit triangles than the previous row.\n**2. Calculate the next three rows:**\n* Row 4: 5 + 2 = 7 unit triangles\n* Row 5: 7 + 2 = 9 unit triangles\n* Row 6: 9 + 2 = 11 unit triangles\n**3. Add up all the unit triangles:**\n* Total unit triangles: 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 = **36**\n**Therefore, there will be 36 unit triangles in the completed triangle.** \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem:\n* **Current rows:**  We start with 3 rows, with 3, 4, and 5 unit triangles respectively.\n* **Adding rows:** We'll add 3 more rows, each with 2 more unit triangles than the previous row.\n* **New rows:** This means the new rows will have 7, 9, and 11 unit triangles.\n* **Total triangles:** To find the total, we add the triangles in each row: 3 + 4 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 = **49 unit triangles**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n* **Rows and Unit Triangles:** The current triangle has 3 rows.  We'll add 3 more rows, bringing the total to 6.\n* **Unit Triangles per Row:** The pattern is that each row has 2 more unit triangles than the previous row. Since the top row has 3, the rows will have: \n    * Row 1: 3 unit triangles\n    * Row 2: 5 unit triangles\n    * Row 3: 7 unit triangles\n    * Row 4: 9 unit triangles\n    * Row 5: 11 unit triangles\n    * Row 6: 13 unit triangles\n* **Total Unit Triangles:** To find the total, we add the number of unit triangles in each row: 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 = **48 unit triangles**.\n**Therefore, there will be 48 unit triangles in the larger triangle.** \n",
