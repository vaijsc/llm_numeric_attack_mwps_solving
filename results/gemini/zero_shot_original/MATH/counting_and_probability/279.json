        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Understand the Favorable Outcomes**\n   We want the ace of spades to be flipped before any face card.  This means the ace of spades could be the very first card, the second card, the third card, and so on, as long as no face card appears before it.\n**2.  Calculate the Total Possible Outcomes**\n   There are 52 cards in a standard deck, so there are 52 possible outcomes for the first card Carson flips.  \n**3.  Calculate the Probability of the First Card Being the Ace of Spades**\n   There's one ace of spades, and 52 total cards, so the probability of flipping the ace of spades first is 1/52.\n**4.  Calculate the Probability of the First Card *Not* Being the Ace of Spades or a Face Card**\n    There are 36 cards that are neither the ace of spades nor a face card (52 total - 1 ace of spades - 12 face cards = 36).  So, the probability of the first card not being the ace of spades or a face card is 36/52.\n**5.  Calculate the Probability of the Second Card Being the Ace of Spades (Given the First Card Wasn't)**\n   If the first card wasn't the ace of spades or a face card, there are only 51 cards left. Since the ace of spades is still in the deck, the probability of flipping it on the second turn is 1/51.\n**6.  Continue This Pattern**\n   We can continue this pattern.  If the first three cards are not the ace of spades or a face card, the probability of flipping the ace of spades on the fourth turn becomes 1/50, and so on.\n**7.  The Key Insight:  The Probabilities Multiply**\n   The probability of the ace of spades appearing before any face card is the product of the probabilities of each scenario. This means:\n   * The probability of getting the ace of spades on the first flip is 1/52\n   * The probability of getting the ace of spades on the second flip is (36/52) * (1/51)\n   * The probability of getting the ace of spades on the third flip is (36/52) * (35/51) * (1/50)\n   * And so on...\n**8.  The Final Calculation**\n   To find the total probability, we sum the probabilities of all these scenarios.  This gives us:\n   1/52 + (36/52) * (1/51) + (36/52) * (35/51) * (1/50) + ...\n   There's a slightly easier way to express this. Notice that each term in the sum is (36/52) times the previous term. This is a geometric series with a common ratio of 36/52. The sum of an infinite geometric series is given by:\n   a / (1 - r) \n   where a is the first term (1/52) and r is the common ratio (36/52).\n   Plugging in the values:\n   (1/52) / (1 - 36/52) = (1/52) / (16/52) = 1/16\n**Therefore, the probability of Carson flipping over the ace of spades before any face card is 1/16.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Favorable Outcomes**\n* We want Carson to flip the ace of spades before any face card.  \n* This means the ace of spades must be the first card he flips.\n**2. Total Possible Outcomes**\n*  There are 52 cards in a standard deck.\n**3. Calculating the Probability**\n* **Probability = (Favorable Outcomes) / (Total Possible Outcomes)**\n* In this case, there's only one favorable outcome (flipping the ace of spades first). \n* There are 52 total possible outcomes (any of the 52 cards could be flipped first).\n* **Probability = 1 / 52**\n**Therefore, the probability that Carson flips over the ace of spades before any face card is 1/52.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this step by step:\n**1.  Favorable Outcomes:**\n* Carson needs to flip the Ace of Spades before any face card.  This means the Ace of Spades must be the first card he flips.\n**2.  Total Possible Outcomes:**\n* There are 52 cards in a standard deck, so there are 52 possible cards he could flip first.\n**3. Probability:**\n* The probability of an event is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n* In this case, there's 1 favorable outcome (flipping the Ace of Spades first) and 52 total possible outcomes.\n* Therefore, the probability of Carson flipping the Ace of Spades before any face card is **1/52**. \n",
        "Here's how to break down the probability:\n* **Possible Outcomes:** There are 52 cards in the deck, and we're interested in the order Carson flips the ace of spades and the face cards.  \n* **Favorable Outcomes:** We want the ace of spades to be flipped before any of the face cards. \n**Let's analyze the scenarios:**\n1. **Ace of Spades First:** If Carson flips the ace of spades first, he wins. This is one favorable outcome.\n2. **Face Card First:** If Carson flips a face card first, he loses.\n**Calculating the Probability:**\n* **Total Possible Orders:** The total number of ways Carson can flip the cards is 52! (52 factorial).\n* **Favorable Orders:** To count the favorable orders, let's think about the places the ace of spades and face cards can occupy:\n    * The ace of spades can be in any of the 52 positions.\n    * The 12 face cards can be in any of the remaining 51 positions. \n    * The rest of the cards can be arranged in the remaining positions.\nTherefore, the number of favorable orders is 52 * 51! (because we're fixing the position of the ace of spades and the face cards).\n**The Probability:**\nThe probability of Carson flipping the ace of spades before any face card is:\n(Favorable Outcomes) / (Total Possible Outcomes) = (52 * 51!) / 52! = **1/52** \n**Therefore, the probability is 1/52.** \n",
