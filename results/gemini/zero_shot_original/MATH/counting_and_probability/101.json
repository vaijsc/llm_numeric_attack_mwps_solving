    "solution": "The total area of the target is $\\pi\\cdot 10^2=100\\pi$.  The area of the inner shaded region is the area of a circle with radius 4, and that is equal to $\\pi\\cdot 4^2=16\\pi$.  We can calculate the area of the shaded ring as the difference in areas of a circle with radius 8 and with radius 6.  This gives an area of $\\pi \\cdot 8^2 - \\pi \\cdot 6^2 = 28\\pi$.  The total shaded area is $16\\pi+28\\pi=44\\pi$.  The probability a dart will hit a shaded region is equal to $\\frac{44\\pi}{100\\pi}=\\boxed{\\frac{11}{25}}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Calculate the Areas**\n* **Area of the whole target (outermost circle):**  \u03c0(10\u00b2)=100\u03c0\n* **Area of the largest unshaded circle:** \u03c0(8\u00b2) = 64\u03c0\n* **Area of the middle unshaded circle:** \u03c0(6\u00b2) = 36\u03c0\n* **Area of the smallest unshaded circle:** \u03c0(4\u00b2) = 16\u03c0\n**2. Calculate the Area of the Shaded Region**\nThe shaded region is the difference between the whole target's area and the areas of the unshaded circles:\n* Area of shaded region = 100\u03c0 - 64\u03c0 - 36\u03c0 + 16\u03c0 = 16\u03c0 \n**3. Calculate the Probability**\nThe probability of the dart hitting the shaded region is the ratio of the shaded area to the total area:\n* Probability = (Area of shaded region) / (Area of whole target) = (16\u03c0) / (100\u03c0) = **1/6** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the areas of the circles:**\n* **Circle 1 (radius 4 inches):**  Area = \u03c0(4\u00b2) = 16\u03c0 square inches\n* **Circle 2 (radius 6 inches):** Area = \u03c0(6\u00b2) = 36\u03c0 square inches\n* **Circle 3 (radius 8 inches):** Area = \u03c0(8\u00b2) = 64\u03c0 square inches\n* **Circle 4 (radius 10 inches):** Area = \u03c0(10\u00b2) = 100\u03c0 square inches\n**2. Calculate the areas of the shaded regions:**\n* **Area of the shaded region between Circle 1 and Circle 2:** 36\u03c0 - 16\u03c0 = 20\u03c0 square inches\n* **Area of the shaded region between Circle 3 and Circle 4:** 100\u03c0 - 64\u03c0 = 36\u03c0 square inches\n**3. Calculate the total shaded area:**\n* Total shaded area = 20\u03c0 + 36\u03c0 = 56\u03c0 square inches\n**4. Calculate the total area of the target:**\n* Total area = 100\u03c0 square inches\n**5. Determine the probability:**\n* Probability of hitting a shaded region = (Total shaded area) / (Total area of target)\n* Probability = (56\u03c0) / (100\u03c0) = **14/25** \n**Therefore, the probability that the dart hits a shaded region is 14/25.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the area of the whole target:**\n* The target is a circle with a radius of 10 inches.\n* Area of a circle = \u03c0 * radius\u00b2 \n* Area of target = \u03c0 * (10 inches)\u00b2 = 100\u03c0 square inches\n**2. Find the area of the unshaded regions:**\n* **Innermost circle (radius 4 inches):** Area = \u03c0 * (4 inches)\u00b2 = 16\u03c0 square inches\n* **Second circle (radius 6 inches):** Area = \u03c0 * (6 inches)\u00b2 = 36\u03c0 square inches\n* **Third circle (radius 8 inches):** Area = \u03c0 * (8 inches)\u00b2 = 64\u03c0 square inches\n**3. Find the area of the shaded region:**\n* **Subtract the areas of the unshaded circles from the total area of the target:**\n   * Shaded area = 100\u03c0 - 16\u03c0 - 36\u03c0 - 64\u03c0 = -16\u03c0 \n   * This answer doesn't make sense, as area cannot be negative.  The mistake is in our logic. The shaded region isn't the area of the whole target minus the unshaded areas. \n**4. Correctly Calculate the Shaded Area:**\n* **The shaded area is the difference between the areas of consecutive circles.**\n* Shaded area = [(\u03c0 * 6\u00b2 - \u03c0 * 4\u00b2) + (\u03c0 * 8\u00b2 - \u03c0 * 6\u00b2) + (\u03c0 * 10\u00b2 - \u03c0 * 8\u00b2)]\n* Simplify: Shaded area = (36\u03c0 - 16\u03c0) + (64\u03c0 - 36\u03c0) + (100\u03c0 - 64\u03c0) = 28\u03c0 square inches\n**5. Calculate the probability:**\n* **Probability = (Favorable Outcomes) / (Total Possible Outcomes)**\n* Favorable Outcomes: The dart landing in the shaded region.\n* Total Possible Outcomes: The dart landing anywhere on the target.\n* Probability = (28\u03c0 square inches) / (100\u03c0 square inches) = **7/25**\n**Therefore, the probability that the dart hits a shaded region is 7/25.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Find the areas**\n* **Area of the entire target:**  This is the area of the largest circle:  \u03c0(10\u00b2) = 100\u03c0 square inches.\n* **Area of the unshaded region:** This is the sum of the areas of the three inner circles:\n    * \u03c0(4\u00b2) + \u03c0(6\u00b2) + \u03c0(8\u00b2) = 16\u03c0 + 36\u03c0 + 64\u03c0 = 116\u03c0 square inches.\n**2. Calculate the area of the shaded region**\n* **Area of shaded region:** Area of entire target - Area of unshaded region = 100\u03c0 - 116\u03c0 = -16\u03c0 square inches. \n**3. Determine the probability**\nSince the area of the shaded region is negative, this means there is *no* shaded region.  Therefore, the probability of hitting the shaded region is **0**. \n",
