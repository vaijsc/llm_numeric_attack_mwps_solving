    "solution": "Let $x$ be the measure of the each of the equal sides.  Since the perimeter is 10 units, the side lengths measure $x$, $x$, and $10-2x$ units.  Since the third side length must be positive, we have $10-2x>0$ which implies $x<5$.  By the triangle inequality, the sum of the two equal sides must exceed the third side.  Solving  $x+x>10-2x$ gives $x>2.5$.  There are $\\boxed{2}$ integers strictly between 2.5 and 5.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**Understanding Isosceles Triangles**\n* An isosceles triangle has two sides of equal length.\n**Perimeter and Side Lengths**\n* The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of its side lengths. In this case, the perimeter is 10.\n**Finding Possible Side Lengths**\nLet's represent the two equal sides as 'x' and the third side as 'y'. We know:\n* x + x + y = 10 \n* 2x + y = 10\nSince we need integer side lengths, we can start trying out values for 'x' and see if we get an integer value for 'y'. \n* **If x = 1:**  2(1) + y = 10  -->  y = 8. This is a valid isosceles triangle (1, 1, 8).\n* **If x = 2:** 2(2) + y = 10 --> y = 6.  This is a valid isosceles triangle (2, 2, 6).\n* **If x = 3:** 2(3) + y = 10 --> y = 4. This is a valid isosceles triangle (3, 3, 4).\n* **If x = 4:** 2(4) + y = 10 --> y = 2. This is a valid isosceles triangle (4, 4, 2). \n**Important Note:** We stop at x = 4 because if x is larger, the sum of the two equal sides (2x) would be greater than 10, making it impossible to form a triangle.\n**The Answer**\nWe found four possible isosceles triangles with a perimeter of 10:\n* (1, 1, 8)\n* (2, 2, 6)\n* (3, 3, 4)\n* (4, 4, 2)\n**Therefore, there are 4 non-congruent isosceles triangles with a perimeter of 10 and integer side lengths.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding Isosceles Triangles**\n* An isosceles triangle has two sides of equal length.\n**Perimeter Condition**\n* The perimeter of the triangle is 10, meaning the sum of all three sides is 10.\n**Finding Possible Side Lengths**\nLet's break down the possibilities, keeping in mind that the sides must be integers and the triangle inequality (the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side):\n* **Case 1:  Two sides of length 4**\n    * The third side would have to be 2 (10 - 4 - 4 = 2).\n    * This works because 4 + 4 > 2, 4 + 2 > 4, and 4 + 2 > 2.\n* **Case 2: Two sides of length 3**\n    * The third side would have to be 4 (10 - 3 - 3 = 4).\n    * This also works because 3 + 3 > 4, 3 + 4 > 3, and 3 + 4 > 3.\n* **Case 3: Two sides of length 5**\n    * The third side would have to be 0 (10 - 5 - 5 = 0).\n    * This is not a valid triangle since a side cannot have length 0.\n**Conclusion**\nWe have found two non-congruent isosceles triangles with a perimeter of 10:\n* **Triangle 1:** Sides of length 4, 4, and 2\n* **Triangle 2:** Sides of length 3, 3, and 4\n**Therefore, there are **two** non-congruent isosceles triangles with a perimeter of 10 and integer side lengths.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**Understanding Isosceles Triangles**\n* An isosceles triangle has two sides of equal length.\n**Perimeter and Integer Sides**\n* The perimeter is the total length of all the sides. \n* We need to find integer side lengths that add up to 10.\n**Possible Cases**\nLet's represent the equal sides as 'x' and the third side as 'y'. We need to find combinations of x and y that satisfy the following:\n* **Perimeter:** 2x + y = 10\n* **Triangle Inequality:**  The sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side.\n**Analyzing the Cases**\n1. **Case 1: x = 1**\n   * y = 8 (2 * 1 + 8 = 10)\n   * This doesn't work because 1 + 1 < 8 (violates the Triangle Inequality).\n2. **Case 2: x = 2**\n   * y = 6 (2 * 2 + 6 = 10)\n   * This works because 2 + 2 > 6 and 2 + 6 > 2.\n3. **Case 3: x = 3**\n   * y = 4 (2 * 3 + 4 = 10)\n   * This works because 3 + 3 > 4 and 3 + 4 > 3.\n4. **Case 4: x = 4**\n   * y = 2 (2 * 4 + 2 = 10)\n   * This works because 4 + 4 > 2 and 4 + 2 > 4.\n**Conclusion**\nWe found three non-congruent isosceles triangles with a perimeter of 10 and integer side lengths:\n* **Triangle 1:** Sides 2, 2, 6\n* **Triangle 2:** Sides 3, 3, 4\n* **Triangle 3:** Sides 4, 4, 2 \n**Therefore, there are **3** non-congruent isosceles triangles that meet the given conditions.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand Isosceles Triangles**\n* An isosceles triangle has two sides of equal length.\n**2. Perimeter and Integer Side Lengths**\n* The perimeter is the total length of all sides.\n* We are looking for triangles where all side lengths are whole numbers.\n**3. Set Up the Problem**\n* Let the two equal sides have length *x*.\n* Let the third side have length *y*.\n* The perimeter is:  x + x + y = 10 \n* Simplifying: 2x + y = 10\n**4. Find Possible Values for x and y**\n* Since *x* and *y* are integers, we need to find pairs of numbers that satisfy the equation 2x + y = 10. \n* We can start by trying different values for *x* and see if we get a whole number for *y*.\n**5. Analyze the Possibilities**\n* **If x = 1:**  2(1) + y = 10  ->  y = 8. This is possible (triangle inequality: 1 + 1 > 8).\n* **If x = 2:** 2(2) + y = 10  ->  y = 6. This is possible (triangle inequality: 2 + 2 > 6).\n* **If x = 3:** 2(3) + y = 10  ->  y = 4. This is possible (triangle inequality: 3 + 3 > 4).\n* **If x = 4:** 2(4) + y = 10 ->  y = 2. This is possible (triangle inequality: 4 + 4 > 2).\n* **If x = 5:** 2(5) + y = 10 ->  y = 0. This is not possible (a side cannot have length 0).\n**6. Count the Non-Congruent Triangles**\nWe have found four possible triangles:\n* (1, 1, 8)\n* (2, 2, 6)\n* (3, 3, 4)\n* (4, 4, 2)\n**Answer:** There are **4** non-congruent isosceles triangles with a perimeter of 10 and integer side lengths. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand Isosceles Triangles**\nAn isosceles triangle has two sides of equal length. Let's call these equal sides 's' and the third side 'b'.\n**2. Perimeter Condition**\nWe know the perimeter is 10: s + s + b = 10 \nSimplifying: 2s + b = 10\n**3. Integer Side Lengths**\nWe need to find integer values for 's' and 'b' that satisfy the equation.\n**4. Triangle Inequality**\nRemember the Triangle Inequality Theorem: The sum of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side. This gives us three inequalities:\n* s + s > b  (2s > b)\n* s + b > s (b > 0)\n* b + s > s (b > 0)\n**5. Finding Possible Values**\nLet's start by trying different values for 's' and see if we can find corresponding integer values for 'b' that satisfy all the conditions:\n* **If s = 1:** \n    * 2s + b = 10 becomes 2 + b = 10, so b = 8.  This violates the Triangle Inequality (2s > b).\n* **If s = 2:**\n    * 2s + b = 10 becomes 4 + b = 10, so b = 6. This satisfies all the conditions.\n* **If s = 3:**\n    * 2s + b = 10 becomes 6 + b = 10, so b = 4. This satisfies all the conditions.\n* **If s = 4:**\n    * 2s + b = 10 becomes 8 + b = 10, so b = 2. This satisfies all the conditions.\n* **If s = 5:**\n    * 2s + b = 10 becomes 10 + b = 10, so b = 0. This violates the Triangle Inequality (b > 0).\n**6. Conclusion**\nWe found three possible non-congruent isosceles triangles with integer side lengths and a perimeter of 10:\n* (s, s, b) = (2, 2, 6)\n* (s, s, b) = (3, 3, 4)\n* (s, s, b) = (4, 4, 2)\n**Therefore, there are 3 non-congruent isosceles triangles with integer side lengths and a perimeter of 10.** \n"
