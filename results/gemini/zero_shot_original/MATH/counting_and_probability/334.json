    "problem": "Julie baked cupcakes for her family at home and for a party at school. She iced 4 cupcakes with red frosting, 2 cupcakes with orange frosting, 2 with yellow, 2 with green, 3 with blue and the last 3 with violet frosting. Each cupcake is iced with exactly one color of frosting. Julie plans to take exactly 10 of the cupcakes to her party, and will take either all of the cupcakes of a particular color or none of the cupcakes of that color. How many different combinations of cupcakes could she take to her party?",

    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "If Julie includes one of the colors that cover three cupcakes, she must also include the other color that covers three cupcakes. This is because she must make ten cupcakes total, and all of the other colors cover an even number of cupcakes, so there is no way to make ten with three and some combination of even numbers. Thus, if she includes blue and violet, she has four cupcakes left to choose. There are three ways in which she can choose four cupcakes if she chooses colors that cover two (green and orange, green and yellow, or orange and yellow). Alternately, she can choose a color that covers four (red). Finally, if she doesn't include any colors that cover three cupcakes, she must choose all of the other cupcakes in order to make ten. Thus, Julie has $\\boxed{5}$ different combinations of cupcakes.",

        "Here's how to break down the problem and find the solution:\n**1. Count the Cupcakes:**\n* Julie has 4 red + 2 orange + 2 yellow + 2 green + 3 blue + 3 violet = **16 cupcakes**\n**2. Consider Choices for Each Color:**\n* For each color, Julie has two options: take all of them or take none of them.\n**3. Calculate Total Combinations:**\n* Since there are 6 colors, and each color has 2 choices, we have 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 2^6 = **64** possible combinations.\n**However, this is not the final answer!**  We need to account for the fact that Julie only wants to take 10 cupcakes. \n**4.  Eliminate Invalid Combinations:**\n* We need to remove any combinations where she takes more than 10 cupcakes. Let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n    * **All red:** 4 cupcakes (valid)\n    * **All orange:** 2 cupcakes (valid)\n    * **All yellow:** 2 cupcakes (valid)\n    * **All green:** 2 cupcakes (valid)\n    * **All blue:** 3 cupcakes (valid)\n    * **All violet:** 3 cupcakes (valid)\n* **Combining colors:**  We can't take all of any two colors without exceeding 10 cupcakes.\n**5.  Final Count:**\n* We have 6 valid combinations (one for each color). \n**Answer:** Julie can take **6** different combinations of cupcakes to her party. \n",

Calculate the Combinations:**\n* Since she has 6 different frosting colors, she has 2 choices for each color.\n* To find the total number of combinations, we multiply the number of choices for each color together: 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 2^6 = 64\n**Therefore, Julie has 64 different combinations of cupcakes she could take to her party.** \n",
        "Here's how to break down the problem:\n* **Total Cupcakes:** Julie baked 4 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 16 cupcakes.\n* **Color Choices:** Julie has 6 different frosting colors to choose from.\n**Finding the Combinations:**\nTo figure out the combinations, we need to consider whether Julie takes each color or not.\n* **Red:**  She can take either all 4 red cupcakes or none.  That's 2 choices.\n* **Orange:**  She can take either both orange cupcakes or none. That's 2 choices.\n* **Yellow:** Same as orange, 2 choices.\n* **Green:**  Same as orange, 2 choices.\n* **Blue:**  She can take either all 3 blue cupcakes or none.

        "Here's how to break down the problem to find the different combinations of cupcakes Julie can take:\n**1. Count the Colors:**\n* Julie has 6 different colors of frosting.\n**2.  Decide on Each Color:**\n* For each color, Julie has two choices: take all the cupcakes of that color or take none.\n**3.  Calculate Combinations:**\n* Since Julie has 6 colors and 2 choices for each color, she has a total of 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = **64** possible combinations.\n**4.  Adjust for the 10 Cupcake Limit:**\n* We need to consider that Julie can only take 10 cupcakes.  Some of the 64 combinations have more than 10 cupcakes.  We'll need to figure out how many combinations have 10 or fewer cupcakes.  \n**5.  Think About the Possibilities:**\n* To have 10 or fewer cupcakes, she can either take all the cupcakes of 2 colors, or all the cupcakes of 1 color and some of the cupcakes of another color.\n**Let's list out the possible scenarios:**\n* **2 colors:** \n    * Red + Orange (4 + 2 = 6)\n    * Red + Yellow (4 + 2 = 6)\n    * ...and so on, all combinations of 2 colors.\n* **1 color + some of another:**\n    * Red + Orange (4 + 1 = 5)\n    * Red + Yellow (4 + 1 = 5)\n    * ...and so on, all combinations of 1 color + 1 cupcake from another.\n**6. Calculate the Valid Combinations:**\n* To get the exact number of valid combinations, you would need to carefully list out all the combinations of 2 colors and 1 color + some of another and count them.  This would be a bit tedious, but you could use a systematic approach to make sure you don't miss any. \n**Final Answer:**\nWhile we can't determine the exact number of valid combinations without listing them out, we know that there are **fewer than 64** combinations, and the exact number is determined by the number of combinations that have 10 or fewer cupcakes. \n"
