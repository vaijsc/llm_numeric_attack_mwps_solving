        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding the Problem**\nThis is a combination problem because the order in which the coach selects the team members doesn't matter.  A team of John, Mary, Sarah, and David is the same as a team of Sarah, David, Mary, and John.\n**The Formula**\nThe number of ways to choose *r* items from a set of *n* items (where order doesn't matter) is given by the following formula:\nnCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)\nWhere:\n* nCr represents the number of combinations\n* n! represents the factorial of n (n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 2 * 1)\n**Applying the Formula**\nIn this case:\n* n = 8 (total number of team members)\n* r = 4 (number of team members to be selected)\nSo, the number of ways to choose 4 team members out of 8 is:\n8C4 = 8! / (4! * (8-4)!)\n     = 8! / (4! * 4!)\n     = (8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((4 * 3 * 2 * 1) * (4 * 3 * 2 * 1))\n     = 70\n**Answer**\nThere are **70** different ways the coach can select a team of 4 members from the 8-member math team. \n",

        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding the Problem**\nThe coach has 8 choices for the first spot on the team.  Once that spot is filled, she has 7 choices left for the second spot, and so on.  This seems like multiplication, but we have to be careful about overcounting.\n**Avoiding Overcounting**\nImagine we pick students Alice, Bob, Carol, and David.  We could have picked them in a different order (like Bob, Carol, David, Alice) and it would still be the same team.  To avoid counting these rearrangements as different teams, we need to divide by the number of ways to order 4 people.\n**Calculation**\n* **Number of ways to choose the first member:** 8\n* **Number of ways to choose the second member:** 7\n* **Number of ways to choose the third member:** 6\n* **Number of ways to choose the fourth member:** 5\nThis gives us 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 = 1680 ways to choose a team if order mattered.\n* **Number of ways to order 4 people:** 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of ways to choose a team of 4 from 8 is 1680 / 24 = **70**. \n",
