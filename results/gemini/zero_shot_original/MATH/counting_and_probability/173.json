    "problem": "How many ways are there to assign each of 6 friends to either the chemistry class or the biology class if one of these six, Manoj, refuses to be in a class without any of his friends?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "For each friend, there are 2 choices for which class to place them in.  Since this choice is independent for each of the 6 friends, we multiply the number of choices together. Hence there are $2^6 = 64$ ways to split the friends into two classes. However, 2 of those 64 arrangements are invalid: we can't put Manoj in chemistry and everyone else in biology, and we can't put Manoj in biology and everyone else in chemistry. So our final answer is $64-2=\\boxed{62}$.",

        "Here's how we can solve this problem:\n**1. Consider Manoj's Restriction:**\n* Manoj must be in a class with at least one of his friends. This means we can't have a scenario where Manoj is alone in one class and all his friends are in the other.\n**2. Cases Based on Manoj's Class:**\n* **Case 1: Manoj is in Chemistry:**\n   *  His 5 friends have two options: Chemistry or Biology.\n   *  There are 2^5 = 32 ways to assign Manoj's friends.\n* **Case 2: Manoj is in Biology:**\n   *  His 5 friends also have two options each.\n   *  Again, there are 2^5 = 32 ways to assign Manoj's friends.\n**3. Total Possible Arrangements:**\n* Since Manoj can be in either class, we add the possibilities from the two cases: 32 + 32 = 64\n**Therefore, there are 64 ways to assign the 6 friends to the two classes, considering Manoj's restriction.** \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Consider Manoj's Restriction**\nManoj's restriction means we need to treat him and his friends as a single unit.  We can't separate them.\n**2.  Grouping Manoj and Friends**\n* Since Manoj has 5 friends, there's a group of 6 people we need to consider.\n**3.  Placement Options for the Group**\n* This group of 6 can be placed entirely in the chemistry class, or entirely in the biology class.  This gives us 2 options.\n**4.  Individual Placement for the Remaining Friends**\n* The remaining friends (those not in Manoj's group) can be placed freely in either class.\n**5.  Calculating the Possibilities**\n*  Each of the remaining friends has 2 options (chemistry or biology). Since there are 0 remaining friends in this case, we have 2^0 = 1 possibility.\n**6.  Total Possibilities**\n*  We multiply the possibilities for the group and the individual placements: 2 options (for the group) * 1 option (for individuals) = **2 ways**\n**Therefore, there are 2 ways to assign the friends to the classes given Manoj's restriction.** \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Consider Manoj's Restriction:**\n* Manoj's restriction means all his friends must be in the same class as him.  We can treat Manoj and his friends as a single unit.\n**2.  Possible Arrangements for the Unit:**\n* **Scenario 1:** The unit (Manoj and his friends) is in the chemistry class.  The remaining people can be placed in either class freely.\n* **Scenario 2:** The unit is in the biology class.  The remaining people can be placed in either class freely.\n**3.  Calculating Arrangements for Each Scenario:**\n* **Let's say Manoj has 'x' friends.**  \n* The unit has (x + 1) people.\n* The remaining people are (6 - (x + 1)) = (5 - x).\n* For each scenario (chemistry or biology), there are 2^(5-x) ways to arrange the remaining people.\n**4.  Total Arrangements:**\n* Since there are two scenarios (chemistry or biology), we multiply the arrangements for each by 2:  2 * 2^(5-x) = 2^(6-x)\n**5.  Finding the Number of Manoj's Friends:**\n* We don't know how many friends Manoj has. We need more information to calculate the final answer.\n**In conclusion:**\nThe number of ways to assign the friends to classes depends on how many friends Manoj has. The formula is **2^(6-x)**, where 'x' is the number of Manoj's friends. \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Consider Manoj's Restriction:**\n* Manoj's restriction means all his friends must be in the same class as him. \n* We can treat Manoj and his friends as a single unit for now.\n**2.  The Possible Units:**\n* **Unit 1:** Manoj and all his friends (let's say there are 'n' friends in this unit). This unit can go in either Chemistry or Biology.\n* **Unit 2:**  The remaining (5 - n) friends. This unit can also go in either Chemistry or Biology.\n**3.  The Choices:**\n* **Unit 1:** Has 2 choices (Chemistry or Biology).\n* **Unit 2:** Has 2 choices (Chemistry or Biology).\n**4.  Total Possibilities:**\n* Since the choices for Unit 1 and Unit 2 are independent, we multiply the number of choices for each unit to get the total possibilities. \n**Therefore, there are 2 * 2 = 4 ways to assign the friends.**\n**Important Note:** We haven't been given the exact number of Manoj's friends (n). The answer is the same regardless of how many friends Manoj has, as long as they must be in the same class as him. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Consider Manoj's Restriction:**\n* Manoj's condition means that all his friends must be in the same class as him.  \n**2. Group Manoj and his Friends:**\n* Treat Manoj and his friends as a single unit. Now we have 5 units to distribute: \n    * The unit containing Manoj and his friends\n    * The 4 remaining individual friends\n**3.  Possible Class Arrangements:**\n* **For the unit:**  The unit of Manoj and his friends can be placed in either the chemistry or biology class (2 options).\n* **For the individuals:** Each of the remaining 4 friends can be placed in either the chemistry or biology class (2 options each).\n**4. Calculate the Total Possibilities:**\n* Total arrangements: 2 (for the unit) * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 (for the 4 individuals) = **32**\n**Therefore, there are 32 ways to assign the 6 friends to the classes, given Manoj's condition.** \n"
