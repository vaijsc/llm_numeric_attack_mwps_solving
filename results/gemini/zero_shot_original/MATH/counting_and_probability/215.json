    "problem": "Bob and Alice each have a bag that contains one ball of each of the colors,  blue, green, orange, red, and violet. Alice randomly selects one ball from her bag and puts it into Bob's bag. Bob then randomly selects one ball from his bag and  puts it into Alice's bag. What is the probability that after this process the contents of the two bags are the same?",

    "solution": "After Alice puts the ball into Bob's bag, his bag will contain six balls: two of one color and one of each of the other colors. After Bob selects a ball and places it into Alice's bag, the two bags will have the same contents if and only if Bob picked one of the two balls in his bag that are the same color. Because there are six balls in the bag when Bob makes his selection, the probability of selecting one of the same colored pair is $2/6=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$.",

        "Here's how to break down the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Alice's Move:**\n* Alice has 5 balls, and she can choose any of them.\n* There's a 1/5 chance she'll pick any specific color.\n**2. Bob's Move:**\n* Now Bob has 6 balls in his bag (5 original ones + 1 from Alice).\n*  For the bags to be the same, Bob *must* pick the ball that Alice put in. \n*  The probability of this is 1/6.\n**3. Combining the Probabilities**\n* To find the probability of both events happening, we multiply the individual probabilities:\n    (1/5) * (1/6) = 1/30\n**Therefore, the probability that the contents of the two bags are the same after this process is 1/30.** \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this step-by-step:\n**1.  Alice's Move:**\n* Alice has 5 balls, and she chooses one at random.  It doesn't matter which color she picks, as long as she puts it in Bob's bag.\n**2. Bob's Move:**\n* Now Bob has 6 balls in his bag (his original 5 plus the one Alice gave him). \n* **For the bags to be the same, Bob *must* pick the ball Alice put in.**  This is because Alice's bag now only has 4 balls left. \n* The probability of Bob picking the ball Alice put in is 1/6 (one out of six balls).\n**Therefore, the probability that after this process the contents of the two bags are the same is 1/6.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Understanding the Goal**\nWe want to find the probability that after the exchange, both bags contain one ball of each color (blue, green, orange, red, and violet).\n**2.  Analyzing the First Exchange**\n* Alice has 5 choices for the ball she puts into Bob's bag. \n* Regardless of which color Alice chooses, Bob's bag now has 6 balls.\n**3.  Analyzing the Second Exchange**\n* Bob has 6 choices for the ball he puts into Alice's bag.\n* For the bags to be the same, Bob must choose the ball that matches the color Alice initially took out.\n**4.  Calculating the Probability**\n* **Probability of Alice choosing a specific color:** 1/5 (since she has 5 choices)\n* **Probability of Bob choosing the matching color:** 1/6 (since he has 6 choices)\n**5.  Overall Probability**\nTo find the overall probability, we multiply the probabilities of each individual event:\n(1/5) * (1/6) = **1/30**\n**Therefore, the probability that after the process, the contents of the two bags are the same is 1/30.** \n",
        "Here's how to break down the problem step by step:\n**1. Alice's Move:**\n* Alice has 5 choices for the ball she picks from her bag.\n*  No matter which ball she picks, she's essentially removing one color from her bag and adding it to Bob's.\n**2. Bob's Move:**\n* Bob now has 6 balls in his bag (his original 5 plus the one Alice added).\n* To have the bags end up the same, Bob *must* pick the ball that Alice added. \n**3. Calculating the Probability:**\n*  The probability that Bob picks the ball Alice added is 1 out of 6 (since there are 6 balls in his bag).\n**Therefore, the probability that the contents of the two bags are the same after this process is 1/6.** \n",

Bob's Move:**\n* Bob has 6 choices of balls to put into Alice's bag.\n**3.  Successful Outcomes:**\nFor the bags to be the same, the following must happen:\n* Alice must choose a ball that is the same color as the one Bob will choose.\n*  Bob must choose the ball Alice put into his bag. \nLet's break down the possibilities:\n* **Scenario 1:** Alice chooses blue, Bob chooses blue (and vice versa) \n* **Scenario 2:** Alice chooses green, Bob chooses green (and vice versa)\n* **Scenario 3:** Alice chooses orange, Bob chooses orange (and vice versa)\n* **Scenario 4:** Alice chooses red, Bob chooses red (and vice versa)\n* **Scenario 5:** Alice chooses violet, Bob chooses violet (and vice versa)\n**4. Calculating Probability:**\n* **For each scenario:** The probability that Alice chooses a specific color is 1/5.  The probability that Bob then chooses the same color ball is 1/6. So, the probability of each scenario is (1/5) * (1/6) = 1/30.\n* **Total Probability:** Since there are 5 successful scenarios, the total probability that the bags will be the same is: 5 * (1/30) = **1/6** \n**Therefore, the probability that after this process the contents of the two bags are the same is 1/6.** \n"
