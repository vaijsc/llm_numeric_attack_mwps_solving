        "Here's how to break down the problem:\n* **First Roll:** You have 8 possible outcomes (numbers 1 through 8).\n* **Second Roll:** You again have 8 possible outcomes, independent of the first roll.\n* **Third Roll:**  Still 8 possible outcomes.\n* **And so on...**\nSince each roll has 8 possibilities, and we have 6 rolls, the total number of possible sequences is:\n8 * 8 * 8 * 8 * 8 * 8 = 8\u2076 = **262,144** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this:\n* **Each roll has 8 possibilities:**  The die has 8 faces, so there are 8 possible outcomes for each of the six rolls.\n* **Multiply the possibilities together:**  Since each roll is independent of the others, we multiply the number of possibilities for each roll to find the total number of sequences. \nTherefore, there are  8 * 8 * 8 * 8 * 8 * 8 =  **8<sup>6</sup> = 262,144** possible sequences. \n",

For each of these outcomes, there are 8 possible outcomes on the second toss, for a total of 8*8 = 64 possible outcomes for the first two tosses.
