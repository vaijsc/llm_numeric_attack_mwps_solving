    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Note that at least one of the boxes must be a $1$-piece box, because the number of chocolates ordered was odd. The problem is now to determine how many ways $14$ pieces can be assembled using the $1$, $2$, and $4$-piece boxes. If we begin with all $1$-piece boxes, there's one way to do that. There are seven ways to have a mix of $1$ and $2$-piece boxes (one $2$-piece, two $2$-pieces, etc. all the way through seven $2$-pieces). Now, each pair of $2$-piece boxes can be replaced by a $4$-piece box. If there is one $4$-piece box, there are six ways to box the remaining ten pieces of chocolate with $1$ and $2$-piece boxes (no $2$-pieces, one $2$-piece, etc. all the way through five $2$-pieces). If there are two $4$-piece boxes, there are four ways to box the remaining six pieces of chocolate (zero through three $2$-piece boxes). Finally, if there are three $4$-piece boxes, there are two ways to box the remaining two pieces of chocolate (either no $2$-piece boxes or one $2$-piece box). Thus, there are a total of $1 + 7 + 6 + 4 + 2 = \\boxed{20}$ combinations of boxes possible.",

        "Here's how we can break down the problem to find the different combinations of boxes:\n**Understanding the Constraints**\n* **Full Boxes:**  Each box must be filled to capacity (1, 2, or 4 chocolates).\n* **Total Chocolates:** We need to use boxes to accommodate exactly 15 chocolates.\n**Finding the Combinations**\n1. **Start with the largest box:** Let's try using as many 4-piece boxes as possible. We can fit a maximum of 3 boxes of 4 (3 x 4 = 12).\n2. **Consider the remaining chocolates:** After using the 4-piece boxes, we have 3 chocolates left (15 - 12 = 3).\n3. **Fill the remaining chocolates:** We can use a single 3-piece box to accommodate the remaining chocolates.\n**So, one combination is 3 boxes of 4 and 1 box of 3.**\n**Let's explore other combinations:**\n* **Two 4-piece boxes:** This leaves us with 7 chocolates (15 - (2 x 4) = 7). We can use three 2-piece boxes to fill these. **This is another combination: 2 boxes of 4 and 3 boxes of 2.**\n* **One 4-piece box:** This leaves us with 11 chocolates (15 - 4 = 11).  We can use five 2-piece boxes to fill these. **This is another combination: 1 box of 4 and 5 boxes of 2.**\n* **No 4-piece boxes:** We can use combinations of 2-piece and 1-piece boxes to get to 15.  \n    * **Seven 2-piece boxes and one 1-piece box:** (as you mentioned)\n    * **Five 2-piece boxes and five 1-piece boxes:** \n    * **Three 2-piece boxes and nine 1-piece boxes:** \n**In total, there are at least 6 different combinations of boxes that can be used to package the 15 chocolates.** \n**Note:** There might be more combinations if we explore further. This is a good starting point to find different ways to package the chocolates! \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem:\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n* We need to find all the ways to combine boxes of 1, 2, or 4 chocolates to hold a total of 15 chocolates.\n* Each box must be full, meaning we can't have a box with leftover space.\n**Strategy:**\nWe can use a systematic approach to find all possible combinations:\n1. **Start with the largest box:** Let's see how many boxes of 4 we can use. We can use a maximum of 3 boxes of 4 (3 * 4 = 12 chocolates).  \n2. **Consider the remaining chocolates:** After using 3 boxes of 4, we have 3 chocolates left (15 - 12 = 3).\n3. **Fill the remaining chocolates:** Now we need to figure out how to package these 3 chocolates:\n    * We could use 3 boxes of 1.\n    * Or, we could use 1 box of 2 and 1 box of 1.\n4. **Continue with smaller boxes:**  Let's try using 2 boxes of 4 (8 chocolates). This leaves us with 7 chocolates to fill.\n    * We could use 3 boxes of 2 and 1 box of 1.\n    * We could use 1 box of 4, 1 box of 2, and 1 box of 1.\n5. **Repeat the process:** Continue working our way down, considering using 1 box of 4, then using no boxes of 4.  Each time, figure out how to package the remaining chocolates with the smaller boxes.\n**Finding all Combinations:**\nHere are all the possible combinations:\n* **3 boxes of 4, 3 boxes of 1** \n* **2 boxes of 4, 3 boxes of 2, 1 box of 1**\n* **2 boxes of 4, 1 box of 2, 1 box of 1, 1 box of 4**\n* **1 box of 4, 3 boxes of 2, 1 box of 1**\n* **1 box of 4, 1 box of 2, 1 box of 1, 1 box of 2, 1 box of 1** \n* **7 boxes of 2, 1 box of 1**\n**Therefore, there are 6 different combinations of boxes that can be used for the customer's 15 chocolate pieces.** \n",
        "Here's how we can break down the problem to find the different combinations:\n**Understanding the Constraints:**\n* **Full Boxes:**  Each box must be filled to capacity (1, 2, or 4 pieces).\n* **Total Pieces:** We need to use boxes to hold exactly 15 pieces of chocolate.\n**Finding the Combinations:**\n1. **Start with the largest box (4 pieces):**\n   * We can use a maximum of 3 boxes of 4 pieces (3 x 4 = 12), leaving 3 pieces to be packaged. \n   * We can also use 2 boxes of 4 pieces (2 x 4 = 8), leaving 7 pieces to be packaged.\n   * We can also use 1 box of 4 pieces (1 x 4 = 4), leaving 11 pieces to be packaged.\n2. **Consider the next largest box (2 pieces):**\n   * If we used 3 boxes of 4 pieces (12 pieces), we need 3 more pieces.  We can use 1 box of 2 pieces to fill the remaining.\n   * If we used 2 boxes of 4 pieces (8 pieces), we need 7 more pieces. We can use 3 boxes of 2 pieces to fill the remaining.\n   * If we used 1 box of 4 pieces (4 pieces), we need 11 more pieces. We can use 5 boxes of 2 pieces to fill the remaining.\n3. **Finally, use the smallest box (1 piece):**\n   * We don't need the 1-piece box in any of the combinations above since we can always achieve 15 pieces using just the 4-piece and 2-piece boxes. \n**The Combinations:**\n* **Combination 1:** 3 boxes of 4 pieces + 1 box of 2 pieces\n* **Combination 2:** 2 boxes of 4 pieces + 3 boxes of 2 pieces \n* **Combination 3:** 1 box of 4 pieces + 5 boxes of 2 pieces\n**Therefore, there are 3 different combinations of boxes that can be used for the customer's 15 chocolate pieces.** \n",
        "Here's how we can break down the problem to find the different combinations:\n**Understanding the Constraints:**\n* **Full boxes:**  Each box must be filled with either 1, 2, or 4 chocolates.\n* **Total 15:** We need to use boxes to hold exactly 15 chocolates.\n**Systematic Approach:**\nWe can use a systematic approach to find all possible combinations.  Let's represent the number of each box type with variables:\n* **x:** Number of 1-piece boxes\n* **y:** Number of 2-piece boxes\n* **z:** Number of 4-piece boxes\n**Equations:**\nWe can set up equations based on our constraints:\n* **Equation 1 (Total chocolates):**  x + 2y + 4z = 15 \n* **Equation 2 (Non-negative boxes):** x \u2265 0, y \u2265 0, z \u2265 0\n**Solving the Equations:**\nNow we need to find all possible solutions for x, y, and z that satisfy these equations. \n**Finding Combinations:**\nOne way to find combinations is to systematically test values. Here's a possible approach:\n1. **Start with the largest box (4-piece):**\n   * If z = 3 (3 boxes of 4), then we've used 12 chocolates, and we need 3 more. This is impossible with the remaining boxes.\n   * If z = 2 (2 boxes of 4), then we've used 8 chocolates, and we need 7 more. This is possible with 3 boxes of 1 piece each (x = 3).  \n   * If z = 1 (1 box of 4), then we've used 4 chocolates, and we need 11 more.  This is possible with 5 boxes of 2 pieces each (y = 5).\n   * If z = 0 (no boxes of 4), we need to find combinations using only 1-piece and 2-piece boxes.\n2. **Continue with smaller boxes:**\n   * **z = 0, y = 7:**  This is possible with 1 box of 1 piece (x = 1). This is the example combination you provided. \n   * **z = 0, y = 6:** This is impossible because we'd need 3 chocolates with only 1-piece boxes, but we can't have a fractional box.\n   * **z = 0, y = 5:** We've already found this solution (z = 1, y = 5, x = 0).\n   * **z = 0, y = 4:**  We'd need 7 chocolates with 1-piece boxes, requiring x = 7. \n   * **z = 0, y = 3:** We'd need 9 chocolates with 1-piece boxes, requiring x = 9. \n   * **z = 0, y = 2:** We'd need 11 chocolates with 1-piece boxes, requiring x = 11.\n   * **z = 0, y = 1:** We'd need 13 chocolates with 1-piece boxes, requiring x = 13.\n   * **z = 0, y = 0:** We'd need 15 chocolates with 1-piece boxes, requiring x = 15.\n**Possible Combinations:**\nTherefore, the possible combinations of boxes are:\n* **1 box of 4, 5 boxes of 2**\n* **2 boxes of 4, 3 boxes of 1**\n* **7 boxes of 2, 1 box of 1**\n* **4 boxes of 2, 7 boxes of 1**\n* **3 boxes of 2, 9 boxes of 1**\n* **2 boxes of 2, 11 boxes of 1**\n* **1 box of 2, 13 boxes of 1**\n* **15 boxes of 1** \nLet me know if you would like me to explain any of the steps in more detail! \n",
