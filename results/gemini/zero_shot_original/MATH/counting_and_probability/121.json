        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Total Number of Possibilities**\n* There are 9 points on the grid.\n* We need to choose 3 points. \n* The total number of ways to choose 3 points out of 9 is given by the combination formula:  \u2079C\u2083 = 9!/(3!6!) = 84.\n**2. Number of Favorable Outcomes (Points on a Line)**\n* **Horizontal Lines:** There are 3 horizontal lines, each with 3 points.  We can choose 3 points from each line in \u00b9C\u2083 = 1 way.  So, there are 3 * 1 = 3 ways to choose points on a horizontal line.\n* **Vertical Lines:**  Similarly, there are 3 vertical lines, each with 3 points, giving us 3 more ways.\n* **Diagonal Lines:** There are 2 diagonal lines, each with 3 points, giving us 2 more ways.\n**3. Calculate the Probability**\n* **Total Favorable Outcomes:** 3 + 3 + 2 = 8\n* **Probability:** (Favorable Outcomes) / (Total Possible Outcomes) = 8 / 84 = **1/10.5**\n**Therefore, the probability that the three randomly chosen points lie on the same straight line is 1/10.5.** \n",
