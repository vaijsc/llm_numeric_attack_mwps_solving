        "**Understanding the Problem**\n* **Binomial Theorem:** The binomial theorem tells us how to expand expressions of the form $(a+b)^n$.  The general term in the expansion is given by:\n   \n   $$ \\binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k$$\n   \n   where $\\binom{n}{k}$ is the binomial coefficient (n choose k), calculated as $\\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$.\n* **Constant Term:** We want the term in the expansion that doesn't have any 'x' variables.\n**Solution**\n1. **Identify 'a' and 'b':**\n   In our expression,  $a = 10x^3$ and $b = -\\frac{1}{2x^2}$.\n2. **Set up the General Term:**\n   The general term in the expansion is:\n   \n   $$\\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \\left(-\\frac{1}{2x^2}\\right)^k$$\n3. **Find the Exponent for 'x':**\n   We want the term where the exponents on 'x' cancel out.  The exponent of 'x' in the general term is: \n   \n   $$3(5-k) - 2k = 15 - 5k$$\n4. **Solve for 'k':**\n   We need $15-5k = 0$ to eliminate 'x'. Solving for 'k', we get: \n   \n   $$k=3$$\n5. **Calculate the Constant Term:**\n   Substitute $k = 3$ back into the general term:\n   $$\\binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^{5-3} \\left(-\\frac{1}{2x^2}\\right)^3$$\n   Simplifying:\n   \n   $$\\frac{5!}{3!2!} (100x^6) \\left(-\\frac{1}{8x^6}\\right)$$\n   $$10 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{1}{8}\\right) = \\boxed{-125}$$\nTherefore, the constant term in the expansion of $(10x^3-\\frac{1}{2x^2})^5$ is **-125**. \n",

        "Here's how to find the constant term in the expansion:\n**1. Understanding the Binomial Theorem**\nThe binomial theorem tells us how to expand expressions of the form $(a + b)^n$:\n$$(a + b)^n = \\binom{n}{0}a^n b^0 + \\binom{n}{1}a^{n-1}b^1 + \\binom{n}{2}a^{n-2}b^2 + ... + \\binom{n}{n}a^0 b^n$$\nwhere $\\binom{n}{k}$ is the binomial coefficient, calculated as:\n$$\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$$\n**2. Identifying the Terms that Contribute to the Constant Term**\nWe want a term where the powers of  'x' cancel out.  Notice that in our expression:\n*  The term  $10x^3$ will contribute powers of 'x' that are multiples of 3.\n* The term $-\\frac{1}{2x^2}$ will contribute powers of 'x' that are multiples of -2.\nTo get a constant term, we need powers of 'x' that add up to zero.  This means we need to find the combination of terms where the power of 'x' in the first term is equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the power of 'x' in the second term.\n**3. Finding the Right Combination**\n* We want the power of 'x' from the first term to be a multiple of 3 and the power of 'x' from the second term to be a multiple of -2.\n* The smallest common multiple of 3 and 2 is 6.  We'll try to get a power of $x^6$ from the first term and a power of $x^{-6}$ from the second term.\n* **First term:** To get $x^6$, we need to raise $10x^3$ to the power of 2. \n* **Second term:** To get $x^{-6}$, we need to raise $-\\frac{1}{2x^2}$ to the power of 3.\n**4. Calculating the Constant Term**\nNow we have our combination:\n* $\\binom{5}{2}(10x^3)^2 \\left(-\\frac{1}{2x^2}\\right)^3$\nLet's simplify:\n* $\\binom{5}{2} (100x^6) \\left(-\\frac{1}{8x^6}\\right)$\n* $\\frac{5!}{2!3!} \\cdot \\frac{100}{-8}$\n* $10 \\cdot \\frac{-25}{2}$ \n* $\\boxed{-125}$\n**Therefore, the constant term in the expansion of  $\\left(10x^3-\\frac{1}{2x^2}\\right)^{5}$ is -125.** \n",
        "Here's how to find the constant term in the expansion:\n**Understanding the Binomial Theorem**\nThe binomial theorem states:\n  \n  (x + y)^n =  \u2211 (n choose k) * x^(n-k) * y^k \nwhere:\n*  (n choose k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!) is the binomial coefficient\n*  n is the power of the binomial\n*  k is the index of the term (starting from 0)\n**Applying the Theorem to Our Problem**\n1. **Identify the terms:** We have x = 10x\u00b3 and y = -1/(2x\u00b2) in our binomial.\n2. **Find the term with x^0:**  Notice that the exponent of 'x' in the expansion will be (3n - 2k) since we have (10x\u00b3)^n * (-1/(2x\u00b2))^k.  We want this exponent to be 0, so we need to solve:\n   3n - 2k = 0\n   Since n = 5,  we get k = 15/2.  This isn't an integer, meaning there is **no term with x^0 in the expansion**.\n**Conclusion**\nSince there's no term where the exponent of 'x' is 0, there's **no constant term** in the expansion of (10x\u00b3 - 1/(2x\u00b2))^5. \n",
        "The constant term in the expansion will come from the term where the powers of $x$ cancel out.  \nTo get a constant term, we need the powers of $x$ to cancel.  This means the exponent on $x$ in the term with $10x^3$ must be the same as the exponent on $x$ in the term with $\\frac{1}{2x^2}$, but opposite in sign.\nLet's use the Binomial Theorem to expand the expression:\n$$\\left(10x^3-\\frac{1}{2x^2}\\right)^5 = \\sum_{k=0}^5 \\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \\left(-\\frac{1}{2x^2}\\right)^k$$\nWe need to find the value of $k$ that makes the powers of $x$ cancel.  The power of $x$ in the $k$th term is  \n$$(5-k)(3) + k(-2) = 15 - 5k.$$We want this to equal zero.  Solving $15-5k=0$, we find $k=3$.\nTherefore, the constant term is \n$$\\binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^{5-3} \\left(-\\frac{1}{2x^2}\\right)^3 = \\binom{5}{3} 10^2 \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3 = \\boxed{-625}.$$"
