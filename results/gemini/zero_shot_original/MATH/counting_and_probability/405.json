    "problem": "During a party, a total of 78 handshakes occurred. If each person shook hands once with each of the other people, how many people were at the party?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Since each person shakes hands with each other person, every pair of people will shake hands once. So, 78 represents the number of pairs, which we can count as ${n \\choose 2}$ where $n$ is the number of people at the party. So, $n(n-1) = 2 \\cdot 78 = 2 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 13 = 12 \\cdot 13$. So, $n=13$ gives us $\\boxed{13}$ people at the party.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding the Pattern**\n* If there are 2 people, there's only 1 handshake.\n* If there are 3 people, there are 3 handshakes (person 1 shakes hands with 2 others, person 2 has already shaken hands with person 1, so they only shake hands with person 3).\n*  You can see a pattern emerging: the number of handshakes is related to the number of people.\n**The Formula**\nThe formula for calculating the number of handshakes is:\n* **n(n - 1) / 2** \n   * Where 'n' is the number of people.\n**Solving for 'n'**\n1. **Set up the equation:**  n(n - 1) / 2 = 78\n2. **Multiply both sides by 2:** n(n - 1) = 156\n3. **Expand the equation:** n\u00b2 - n = 156\n4. **Move all terms to one side:** n\u00b2 - n - 156 = 0\n5. **Factor the equation:** (n - 13)(n + 12) = 0\n6. **Solve for 'n':**  \n   * n - 13 = 0  --> n = 13\n   * n + 12 = 0 --> n = -12 (We discard this solution since we can't have a negative number of people)\n**Answer:** There were **13** people at the party. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding the Pattern**\n* If there were 2 people at the party, there would be 1 handshake.\n* If there were 3 people, there would be 3 handshakes (person 1 shakes hands with 2 others, person 2 already shook hands with person 1, so they shake hands with 1 more person). \n* With 4 people, there would be 6 handshakes.\nNotice that the number of handshakes increases as the number of people increases. \n**The Formula**\nThere's a formula to calculate this:\n* **n(n - 1) / 2 = number of handshakes** \n   * Where 'n' is the number of people.\n**Solving the Problem**\n1. **Set up the equation:**  n(n - 1) / 2 = 78\n2. **Multiply both sides by 2:**  n(n - 1) = 156\n3. **Find two consecutive numbers that multiply to 156:**  13 x 12 = 156\n4. **The larger number is the answer:**  n = 13\n**Therefore, there were 13 people at the party.** \n",

The number of handshakes is related to the number of people in a way that can be represented by a formula:\n* **n(n-1)/2**  where 'n' is the number of people.\n**Solving the Problem**\n1. **Set up the equation:**  We know 78 handshakes occurred, so:\n   n(n-1)/2 = 78\n2. **Simplify:**\n   n(n-1) = 156\n3. **Find the factors of 156:**  The factors of 156 that are one apart are 12 and 13.\n4. **Solution:**  Therefore, there were **13 people** at the party. \n",
