    "problem": "How many distinct values are possible for the expression $8 + 4 \\times 6 \\div 2$ if one set of parentheses may be placed in the expression?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Without parentheses, the expression has the value (following order of operations) $8 + (4 \\times 6)/2 = 20$. The parentheses can modify the order of operations, either through $(8+4) \\times 6 \\div 2 = 36$ or $(8 + 4 \\times 6)/2 = 16$, giving $\\boxed{3}$ distinct values. (Note that placing parentheses that exclude the first number doesn't affect the result, since the only important order of operations here is multiplication before addition.)",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step by step:\n**1. Understand Order of Operations**\nWe need to remember the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):\n* **P**arentheses (or **B**rackets)\n* **E**xponents (or **O**rders)\n* **M**ultiplication and **D**ivision (from left to right)\n* **A**ddition and **S**ubtraction (from left to right)\n**2. Evaluate without Parentheses**\nWithout parentheses, the expression evaluates as:\n*  8 + 4 \u00d7 6 \u00f7 2 = 8 + 24 \u00f7 2 = 8 + 12 = 20\n**3. Place Parentheses**\nWe can place parentheses in three different ways:\n* **(8 + 4) \u00d7 6 \u00f7 2:** This evaluates to (12) \u00d7 6 \u00f7 2 = 72 \u00f7 2 = 36\n* **8 + (4 \u00d7 6) \u00f7 2:** This evaluates to 8 + (24) \u00f7 2 = 8 + 12 = 20\n* **8 + 4 \u00d7 (6 \u00f7 2):** This evaluates to 8 + 4 \u00d7 (3) = 8 + 12 = 20\n**4. Identify Distinct Values**\nWe have three distinct values:\n* 20\n* 36\n**Answer:** There are **two** distinct values possible for the expression when one set of parentheses is placed. \n",
