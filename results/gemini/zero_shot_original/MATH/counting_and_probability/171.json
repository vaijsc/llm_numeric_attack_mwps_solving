        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understanding Combinations**\nThis problem involves combinations, not permutations, because the order of the cards in your hand doesn't matter. A hand with Ace of Spades, King of Hearts, Queen of Diamonds, Jack of Clubs, and 10 of Hearts is the same as a hand with 10 of Hearts, Queen of Diamonds, Jack of Clubs, King of Hearts, and Ace of Spades.\n**2. The Formula**\nThe formula for combinations is:\nnCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)\nWhere:\n* n = total number of items (52 cards in a deck)\n* r = number of items to choose (5 cards in a hand)\n* ! = factorial (e.g., 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)\n**3. Applying the Formula**\n* n = 52\n* r = 5\nSo, the number of possible 5-card hands is:\n52C5 = 52! / (5! * (52-5)!)\n      = 52! / (5! * 47!)\n      = (52 * 51 * 50 * 49 * 48) / (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)\n      = 2,598,960\n**Answer:** There are 2,598,960 possible distinct 5-card hands that can be dealt from a standard 52-card deck. \n",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Problem**\nWe need to find the number of ways to choose 5 cards out of 52, without caring about the order in which they are selected. This is a combination problem.\n**2. The Formula**\nThe formula for combinations is:\nnCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)\nWhere:\n* n = the total number of items (in this case, 52 cards)\n* r = the number of items being chosen (in this case, 5 cards)\n* ! means factorial (e.g., 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)\n**3. Apply the Formula**\nLet's plug in our values:\n52C5 = 52! / (5! * (52-5)!)\n**4. Calculate**\n* 52! = 52 * 51 * 50 * ... * 2 * 1\n* 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1\n* 47! = 47 * 46 * 45 * ... * 2 * 1\nAfter calculating, we get:\n52C5 = 2,598,960\n**Answer:** There are 2,598,960 possible distinct 5-card hands that can be dealt from a standard 52-card deck. \n",
