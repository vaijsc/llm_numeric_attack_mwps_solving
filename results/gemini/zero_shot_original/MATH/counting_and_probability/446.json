        "Here's how to solve this problem step by step:\n**1. Understand the problem:**\nWe need to find how many numbers are divisible by  9\u00b3 (which is 729) and lie between 9\u2074 (6561) and 9\u2075 (59049).\n**2. Find the smallest multiple:**\n* The smallest multiple of 729 that is greater than 6561 is 2 * 729 = 1458.\n**3. Find the largest multiple:**\n* The largest multiple of 729 that is less than 59049 is 80 * 729 = 58320.\n**4. Count the multiples:**\n*  We need to count the number of multiples of 729 from 2 * 729 to 80 * 729. \n* This is the same as counting the numbers from 2 to 80.\n* There are **79** numbers between 2 and 80.\n**Answer:** There are **79** multiples of 9\u00b3 between 9\u2074 and 9\u2075. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Problem:**\n* We need to find multiples of  9\u00b3 (which is 729) that fall between 9\u2074 (which is 6561) and 9\u2075 (which is 59049).\n**2. Find the First Multiple:**\n* Divide the lower bound (9\u2074) by 9\u00b3:  6561 / 729 = 9\n* This means 9 * 9\u00b3 is the smallest multiple of 9\u00b3 greater than 9\u2074.\n**3. Find the Last Multiple:**\n* Divide the upper bound (9\u2075) by 9\u00b3: 59049 / 729 = 81\n* This means 81 * 9\u00b3 is the largest multiple of 9\u00b3 less than 9\u2075.\n**4. Count the Multiples:**\n* We need to count all the multiples of 9\u00b3 from 9 * 9\u00b3 to 81 * 9\u00b3. This is equivalent to counting the integers from 9 to 81.\n* There are 81 - 9 + 1 = **73** multiples of 9\u00b3 between 9\u2074 and 9\u2075.\n**Therefore, there are 73 multiples of 9\u00b3 greater than 9\u2074 and less than 9\u2075.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Problem**\nWe need to find how many numbers are divisible by  $9^3$ (which is the same as saying multiples of $9^3$) and fall between $9^4$ and $9^5$.\n**2. Simplify the Numbers**\n*  $9^3 = 9 \\times 9 \\times 9 = 729$\n*  $9^4 = 9 \\times 9 \\times 9 \\times 9 = 6561$\n*  $9^5 = 9 \\times 9 \\times 9 \\times 9 \\times 9 = 59049$\n**3. Find the First Multiple**\nThe smallest multiple of $729$ that is greater than $6561$ is $729 \\times 9 = 6561$. This is just $9^4$.\n**4. Find the Last Multiple**\nThe largest multiple of $729$ that is less than $59049$ is $729 \\times 81 = 59049$. This is just $9^5$.\n**5. Count the Multiples**\nWe need to count the multiples of $729$ from $9^4$ to $9^5$. Notice that each multiple of $729$ is formed by multiplying it by the next consecutive integer.\n*  $9^4 = 729 \\times 9$\n*  $9^4 + 729 = 729 \\times 10$\n*  $9^4 + 729 \\times 2 = 729 \\times 11$\n*  ... and so on until $9^5 = 729 \\times 81$\nTherefore, we are counting the integers from 9 to 81, which means there are **72** multiples of $9^3$ between $9^4$ and $9^5$. \n",

Simplify the problem:**\n*  Notice that $9^4 = 9^3 \\cdot 9$ and $9^5 = 9^3 \\cdot 9^2$. \n*  This means we're looking for multiples of $9^3$ that are greater than $9^3 \\cdot 9$ and less than $9^3 \\cdot 9^2$.\n**3. Find the range:**\n* The first multiple of $9^3$ greater than $9^3 \\cdot 9$ is $9^3 \\cdot 10$.\n* The last multiple of $9^3$ less than $9^3 \\cdot 9^2$ is $9^3 \\cdot 81$.\n**4. Count the multiples:**\nWe have multiples of $9^3$ from $9^3 \\cdot 10$ to $9^3 \\cdot 81$.  This is a sequence of multiples with a common difference of $9^3$.  To count them, we can subtract the first term from the last term, divide by the common difference, and add 1:\n*  ($9^3 \\cdot 81 - 9^3 \\cdot 10$) / $9^3$ + 1 \n*  = (81 - 10) + 1\n*  = 72\n**Answer:** There are **72** multiples of $9^3$ greater than $9^4$ and less than $9^5$. \n",
