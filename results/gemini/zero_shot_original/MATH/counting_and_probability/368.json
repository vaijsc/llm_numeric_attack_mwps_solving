    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Let $x$ be the number of students taking physics, so the number in chemistry is $2x$.  There are 15 students taking all three, and 30 students in both physics and calculus, meaning there are $30 - 15 = 15$ students in just physics and calculus.  Similarly there are $60$ students in just chemistry and calculus, and $60$ in physics and chemistry.  Since there are $x$ students in physics and $15 + 15 + 60 = 90$ students taking physics along with other classes, $x - 90$ students are just taking physics.  Similarly, there are $2x - 135$ students taking just chemistry and $90$ students taking just calculus.  Knowing that there are 15 students not taking any of them, the sum of these eight categories is 360, the total number of people at the school:   \\[\n(x - 90) + (2x - 135) + 90 + 60 + 15 + 60 + 15 + 15 = 360.\n\\] We solve for $x$ and find that the number of physics students is $x = \\boxed{110}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize with a Venn Diagram**\nDraw a Venn Diagram with three overlapping circles representing Calculus, Physics, and Chemistry.  \n**2.  Fill in the \"All Three\" Section**\nWe know 15 students take all three subjects, so write \"15\" in the center where all three circles overlap.\n**3.  Fill in the \"None\" Section**\n15 students take none of the subjects, so write \"15\" outside all the circles.\n**4.  Use the \"Both\" Information**\n* 75 students take both Calculus and Chemistry.  Since 15 take all three, write \"60\" in the overlapping section of the Calculus and Chemistry circles. \n* 75 students take both Physics and Chemistry. Since 15 take all three, write \"60\" in the overlapping section of the Physics and Chemistry circles.\n* 30 students take both Physics and Calculus. Since 15 take all three, write \"15\" in the overlapping section of the Physics and Calculus circles.\n**5.  Use the \"Calculus Only\" Information**\n* 180 students take Calculus.  We've accounted for 60 + 15 + 15 = 90 students in the Calculus circle already.\n*  Therefore, 180 - 90 = 90 students take only Calculus. Write \"90\" in the appropriate section of the Calculus circle.\n**6.  Set up an Equation**\n* Let 'x' represent the number of students who take only Physics.\n* Twice as many students take Chemistry as Physics, so 2x students take only Chemistry.\n**7.  Use the Total Number of Students**\n* The total number of students must be 360. \n* Add up all the numbers in your Venn diagram: 90 + 15 + 60 + x + 15 + 60 + 2x + 15 = 360 \n**8.  Solve for 'x'**\n* Combine like terms: 270 + 3x = 360\n* Subtract 270 from both sides: 3x = 90\n* Divide both sides by 3: x = 30\n**9.  Find the Total Taking Physics**\n*  The total number of students taking Physics is x + 15 + 60 = 30 + 15 + 60 = 105\n**Answer:**  105 students take physics. \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize with a Venn Diagram**\nDraw a Venn diagram with three overlapping circles representing Calculus, Physics, and Chemistry. The overlapping regions represent students taking combinations of these subjects.\n**2. Fill in the Known Overlaps**\n*  We know 30 students take both Physics and Calculus.  \n*  75 students take both Calculus and Chemistry.\n*  75 students take both Physics and Chemistry.\n**3.  Find the Number Taking Only Physics and Chemistry**\n*  Since 75 students take both Physics and Chemistry, and 30 take both Physics and Calculus, then 75 - 30 = 45 students take *only* Physics and Chemistry. \n**4. Find the Number Taking Only Physics**\n*  Let 'x' represent the number of students taking only Physics.\n*  We know twice as many students take Chemistry as Physics. Since 75 take both Physics and Chemistry, and 45 take only Physics and Chemistry, there are 75 + 45 = 120 students taking Chemistry in total.\n*  Since twice as many take Chemistry, we know 120 / 2 = 60 students take only Chemistry.\n*  We know 180 students take Calculus, 75 take both Calculus and Chemistry, and 30 take both Calculus and Physics. Therefore, 180 - 75 - 30 = 75 students take *only* Calculus.\n**5. Use the Total Number of Students**\n* We know that 15 students take no subjects and 360 students total. Therefore, 360 - 15 = 345 students take at least one subject.\n*  We can now add up all the sections of our Venn diagram: 75 (only Calculus) + 30 (Calculus and Physics) + 75 (Calculus and Chemistry) + x (only Physics) + 45 (Physics and Chemistry) + 60 (only Chemistry) = 345 \n*  This simplifies to 285 + x = 345\n*  Solving for x, we find x = 60\n**Therefore, 60 students take only Physics.** \n",
        "Here's how we can break down the problem step-by-step to find the number of students taking physics:\n**1. Visual Representation:**\n* It's helpful to visualize this problem with a Venn diagram. Draw three overlapping circles representing Calculus, Physics, and Chemistry.\n**2. Filling in the Diagram:**\n* **Center:**  We know 15 students take all three subjects, so write \"15\" in the overlapping center of all three circles.\n* **Outside:**  15 students take none, so write \"15\" outside all three circles.\n**3. Calculus and Chemistry:**\n* 75 students take both Calculus and Chemistry. We've already accounted for 15 (the ones taking all three), so 75 - 15 = 60 students take only Calculus and Chemistry.  Write \"60\" in the overlapping region of the Calculus and Chemistry circles.\n**4. Physics and Chemistry:**\n* Similarly, 75 students take both Physics and Chemistry.  Subtract the 15 who take all three, leaving 75 - 15 = 60 students taking only Physics and Chemistry. Write \"60\" in the overlapping region of the Physics and Chemistry circles.\n**5. Physics and Calculus:**\n*  30 students take both Physics and Calculus.  Subtract the 15 who take all three, leaving 30 - 15 = 15 students taking only Physics and Calculus. Write \"15\" in the overlapping region of the Physics and Calculus circles.\n**6. Calculus Only:**\n* We know 180 students take Calculus.  We've already accounted for 60 + 15 + 15 = 90 students.  Therefore, 180 - 90 = 90 students take only Calculus. Write \"90\" in the section of the Calculus circle that doesn't overlap with the other two circles.\n**7. Chemistry Only:**\n* Let's say 'x' students take only Physics. We know twice as many students take Chemistry as Physics.  This means (2*x) + 60 + 15 = the number of students taking Chemistry.\n**8. Total Students:**\n* The total number of students is 360. We can now write an equation to represent this:\n   90 + 15 + 60 + x + 60 + (2*x) + 15 = 360\n**9. Solve for x:**\n* Simplify the equation: 240 + 3x = 360\n* Subtract 240 from both sides: 3x = 120\n* Divide both sides by 3: x = 40\n**10. Find the Number of Students Taking Physics:**\n*  We know 'x' represents the number of students taking only Physics.  Therefore, 40 students take only Physics.\n* Add the students taking Physics with other subjects: 40 + 15 + 60 = 115 students take Physics.\n**Answer:** 115 students take Physics. \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize with a Venn Diagram:**\nIt's helpful to draw a Venn diagram with three overlapping circles representing Calculus, Physics, and Chemistry.\n**2.  Start with the Overlaps:**\n* We know 15 students take all three subjects, so write \"15\" in the center where all circles overlap.\n*  75 take both Calculus and Chemistry:  Subtract the 15 already accounted for: 75 - 15 = 60. Write \"60\" in the overlap between Calculus and Chemistry circles.\n* 75 take both Physics and Chemistry: Subtract the 15: 75 - 15 = 60. Write \"60\" in the overlap between Physics and Chemistry circles.\n* 30 take both Physics and Calculus: Subtract the 15: 30 - 15 = 15. Write \"15\" in the overlap between Physics and Calculus circles.\n**3. Use the Total Calculus Students:**\n* 180 students take Calculus.  We've accounted for 60 + 15 + 15 = 90 in the overlaps. \n* Subtract to find the number taking ONLY Calculus: 180 - 90 = 90. Write \"90\" in the Calculus circle, outside the overlaps.\n**4.  Let 'x' represent Physics Students:**\n* Let 'x' be the number of students taking ONLY Physics.\n**5. Use the Chemistry Information:**\n* Twice as many students take Chemistry as Physics.  \n* We know 60 + 15 + 60 = 135 students are already accounted for in the Chemistry circle.\n* So, the total number of Chemistry students is 2 * (x + 15 + 60) = 2x + 150.\n**6. Set up an Equation:**\n* The total number of students is 360, and 15 take none of the subjects.  So, 360 - 15 = 345 students take at least one subject.\n* Add up all the students in the Venn diagram: 90 + x + 15 + 60 + 60 + 15 + 2x + 150 = 345\n**7. Solve for x:**\n* Combine like terms: 3x + 390 = 345\n* Subtract 390 from both sides: 3x = -45\n* Divide both sides by 3: x = -15\n**8.  Interpretation:**\nWe get a negative answer for x, which doesn't make sense. This means there's likely an error in the problem statement. It's impossible to have a negative number of students taking physics. \n**Conclusion:** There's an inconsistency in the information given in the problem. You'll need to double-check the original information to find the error. \n",
