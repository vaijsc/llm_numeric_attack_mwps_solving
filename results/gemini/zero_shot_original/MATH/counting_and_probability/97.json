        "Let's break down the problem:\n**Understanding the Problem**\nThe notation $*(n)$ represents a set containing four elements derived from the integer $n$.  We need to find how many distinct integers $n$ will produce a set $*(n)$ with only three distinct elements. This means two of the elements in the set must be equal. \n**Analyzing the Possibilities**\nLet's consider how two elements in the set could be equal:\n* **Case 1:  n - 2 = n + 2**  This leads to a contradiction (2 = -2), so this case is impossible.\n* **Case 2: n - 2 = 2n** Solving, we get  n = -2.  Let's check if $*(n)$ has only three distinct elements: $*( -2) = \\{-4, 0, -4, -1\\}$, which indeed has only three distinct elements.\n* **Case 3: n - 2 = n/2** Solving, we get n = 4. Checking, we find $*(4) = \\{2, 6, 8, 2\\}$, which also has only three distinct elements. \n* **Case 4: n + 2 = 2n** Solving, we get n = 2. Checking, we find $*(2) = \\{0, 4, 4, 1\\}$, which has only three distinct elements. \n* **Case 5: n + 2 = n/2** Solving, we get n = -4/3. This is not an integer, so we discard it.\n* **Case 6: 2n = n/2** Solving, we get n = 0. Checking, we find $*(0) = \\{-2, 2, 0, 0\\}$, which has only three distinct elements.\n* **Case 7:  n/2 = n - 2** This is the same as Case 3, which we've already analyzed.\n**The Solution**\nWe found five distinct integers that produce a set $*(n)$ with only three distinct elements:\n* **n = -2, n = 2, n = 4, n = 0, n = -4/3 (but we discard this as it's not an integer)**\nTherefore, there are **four** distinct integers that satisfy the condition. \n",
        "Let's analyze the conditions for $*(n)$ to have exactly three distinct elements:\n* **Case 1: Two elements are equal.** \n    * If $n - 2 = n + 2$, this is impossible.\n    * If $n - 2 = 2n$, then $n = -2$.\n    * If $n - 2 = \\frac{n}{2}$, then $n = 4$.\n    * If $n + 2 = 2n$, then $n = 2$.\n    * If $n + 2 = \\frac{n}{2}$, then $n = -\\frac{4}{3}$ (not an integer).\n    * If $2n = \\frac{n}{2}$, then $n = 0$.\n* **Case 2: Three elements are equal.** \n    * If $n - 2 = n + 2 = 2n$, then $n = -2$ and $2n = -4$, which works.\n    * If $n - 2 = n + 2 = \\frac{n}{2}$, then $n = -4$ and $\\frac{n}{2} = -2$, which works.\n    * If $n - 2 = 2n = \\frac{n}{2}$, this is impossible.\n    * If $n + 2 = 2n = \\frac{n}{2}$, this is impossible.\nTherefore, the distinct integers $n$ that satisfy the condition are $\\boxed{-4, -2, 0, 2, 4}$.
