        "Here's how we can solve this problem:\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\nWe have a circle with 200 points evenly spaced around it. We want to find how many squares we can create using these points as corners.\n**2. Key Insight**\nTo form a square, we need four points that are equally spaced around the circle.  This means the angle between any two consecutive points of the square must be 90 degrees.\n**3. Finding the Suitable Angles**\n* The circle has 360 degrees. \n* To have 90-degree angles in the square, the angle between each point must be 360/4 = 90 degrees. \n**4. Finding the Number of Squares**\n* Since we have 200 points, we need to find how many groups of 4 points are spaced 90 degrees apart.\n* Each point has 4 possible \"partners\" to create a square (90 degrees away).\n* However, we've overcounted because each square has been counted 4 times (once for each corner).\n* Therefore, the total number of squares is (200 * 4) / 4 = **200**.\n**Answer:** There are **200** squares that can be formed. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\nWe have a circle with 200 equally spaced points.  We want to find how many squares we can form using these points as corners.\n**2. Key Observation**\nFor a quadrilateral to be a square, all sides must be equal and all angles must be 90 degrees.\n**3. Finding the Squares**\n* **Start with one point:** Consider any one point on the circle. \n* **Find the other vertices:** To form a square, the next point must be 1/4 of the way around the circle from our starting point.  The third point must be another 1/4 of the way around, and so on.\n* **Spacing:** Since the points are equally spaced, for a square to form, the distance between our chosen points must be a multiple of 50 (because 200 / 4 = 50).\n**4. Counting the Possibilities**\n* **Possible distances:** The distances between points could be 50, 100, 150... up to 150 (because 200 - 50 = 150).\n* **Number of squares for each distance:** For each of these distances, we can form a square.  For example, if the distance is 50, we can start at any of the 200 points and form a square.\n* **Total squares:** We have 11 possible distances (50, 100, ..., 150).  Since each distance leads to a unique square, we have a total of **11 squares**. \n**Therefore, 11 squares can be formed with 4 of the 200 points as vertices.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step by step:\n**1. Choosing the First Point:**\n* You have 200 choices for the first point of your square.\n**2. Choosing the Second Point:**\n*  To form a square, the second point must be a specific distance away from the first point.  Since the points are equally spaced, there are a limited number of positions that will work. Let's figure out how many. \n* Imagine the circle divided into quadrants.  To make a square, the second point must be in the same quadrant as the first point, but at a certain angle away.\n**3.  Finding the Right Angle:**\n* Think of the angle between the first and second point as a fraction of the whole circle (360 degrees).  Since we want a square, this angle must be 90 degrees / 4 = 22.5 degrees.\n* To get a 22.5-degree angle, you need to skip a certain number of points.  \n* The number of points you skip is related to the fraction of the circle that 22.5 degrees represents: (22.5 degrees / 360 degrees) = 1/16.  This means you need to skip 1/16 of the 200 points, which is 12.5 points.  Since you can't skip half a point, there's only **one** valid position for the second point.\n**4.  Choosing the Third and Fourth Points:**\n*  Once you have the first two points, the third and fourth points are determined. They must be the same distance away from the second and first points, respectively, and form 90-degree angles.\n**5.  The Catch:**\n* You might think you can just keep picking a new starting point and repeat the process, forming a new square each time.  However, there's a crucial point: the squares you create will overlap!\n**6.  Avoiding Overlap:**\n*  The key is to avoid double-counting squares.  If you start at one point and move clockwise to create a square, you'll get the same square if you start at the next point and move clockwise. \n* Therefore, you only need to consider every fourth point as your starting point to avoid overlap.\n**7.  The Calculation:**\n* You have 200 points, and you only need to consider every fourth point. This means you can form 200 / 4 = 50 distinct squares.\n**Therefore, you can form 50 squares with 4 of the 200 points as vertices.** \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem:\n**1. Choosing the First Vertex:**\n* We have 200 choices for the first vertex of our square.\n**2. Choosing the Second Vertex:**\n* To form a square, the second vertex must be a specific distance away from the first vertex.  Since the points are equally spaced, there are only a limited number of points that could be the second vertex. Let's think about the angles involved:\n   * For a square, each angle is 90 degrees. \n   * The 200 points divide the circle into 200 equal arcs. \n   * To find the number of points that form a 90-degree angle with the first vertex, we need to see how many of these arcs fit into a 90-degree angle: \n     * (90 degrees / (360 degrees / 200)) = 50 arcs\n   * Therefore, there are 50 possible choices for the second vertex.\n**3. Choosing the Third and Fourth Vertices:**\n* Once we've chosen the first two vertices, the positions of the third and fourth vertices are determined.  There's only one way to place the third and fourth vertices to complete the square.\n**4. Avoiding Overcounting:**\n* We've overcounted the squares! Why? Because if we start by choosing a different vertex of the same square, we'll end up counting that same square again.  Since a square has 4 vertices, we've counted each square 4 times.\n**5. Calculation:**\n* Total possible combinations: 200 * 50 = 10,000\n* Divide by 4 to correct for overcounting: 10,000 / 4 = 2,500\n**Answer:** There are **2,500** squares that can be formed. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\nWe have 200 points evenly distributed around a circle.  We want to find how many ways we can choose 4 of these points to form the vertices of a square.\n**2. Key Insight**\nTo form a square, we need four points that are equally spaced around the circle.  This means the angle between each pair of consecutive points must be 90 degrees.\n**3. Finding Suitable Point Combinations**\n* **Start with one point:** Pick any point on the circle. \n* **Find the next point:** To form a square, the next point must be 90 degrees away. Since there are 200 points, this means there are 200/4 = 50 points that could be the next point.\n* **Find the third point:** The third point needs to be 90 degrees from the second point (and 180 degrees from the first).  There's only one point that fits this condition.\n* **Find the fourth point:** The fourth point must be 90 degrees from the third point (and 270 degrees from the first).  Again, there's only one point that fits.\n**4. Avoiding Overcounting**\nNotice that if we start with a different point, we'll essentially get the same square (just rotated). We've overcounted.  Since there are 200 points, we've overcounted by a factor of 200.\n**5. Calculation**\n* Initially, we might think there are 50 * 1 * 1 = 50 possible squares.\n* We need to divide by 200 to correct for overcounting: 50 / 200 = 1/4\n**Therefore, there is only 1/4 of a square that can be formed using the 200 points. Since we can't have fractions of squares, the answer is that **no squares** can be formed.** \n"
