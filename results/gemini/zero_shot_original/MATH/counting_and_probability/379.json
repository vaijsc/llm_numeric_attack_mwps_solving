    "solution": "First we count the arrangements if the two T's are unique, which is $4!$. Then since the T's are not unique, we divide by $2!$ for the arrangements of T, for an answer of $\\dfrac{4!}{2!} = \\boxed{12}$.",

        "Here's how to determine the number of ways to arrange the letters of the word \"THAT\":\n**1. Count the letters:**\nThe word \"THAT\" has 4 letters.\n**2. Consider repetition:**\nThere are no repeated letters in the word \"THAT\".\n**3. Calculate the factorial:**\nSince we have 4 distinct letters, the number of ways to arrange them is 4! (4 factorial).\n**4. Calculate the factorial:**\n4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24\n**Therefore, there are 24 different ways to arrange the letters of the word \"THAT\".** \n",

Consider Repetition:**\n* There are no repeated letters in \"THAT\".\n**3. Calculate the Factorial:**\n* When you have a set of distinct objects, the number of ways to arrange them is given by the factorial of the number of objects. \n* In this case, the factorial of 4 (denoted by 4!) is: 4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24\n**Therefore, there are 24 ways to arrange the letters of the word \"THAT\".** \n",
