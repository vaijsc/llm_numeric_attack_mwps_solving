        "Here's how to solve this step-by-step:\n**Understanding the Problem**\nWe have a group of 6 students and need to figure out how many different ways we can choose a group of 5 students.  This is a combination problem because the order we choose the students doesn't matter.\n**The Formula**\nThe number of ways to choose *r* items from a set of *n* items (where order doesn't matter) is given by the combination formula:\nnCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)\nWhere:\n* nCr represents the number of combinations\n* n! is the factorial of n (n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 2 * 1)\n**Applying the Formula**\nIn our problem:\n* n = 6 (total number of students)\n* r = 5 (number of students to be selected)\nSo, the number of ways to select 5 students from 6 is:\n6C5 = 6! / (5! * (6-5)!) \n     = 6! / (5! * 1!)\n     = (6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) * 1)\n     = 6 / 1\n     = 6\n**Answer**\nThere are **6** different ways to select 5 students from a group of 6 students. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding the Problem**\nWe have 6 students and need to choose a group of 5.
