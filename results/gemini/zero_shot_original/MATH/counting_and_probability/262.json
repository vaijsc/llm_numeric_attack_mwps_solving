    "solution": "After Pierre sits, we can place Rosa either two seats from Pierre (that is, with one seat between them) or three seats from Pierre. We tackle these two cases separately:\n\nCase 1: Rosa is two seats from Pierre. There are $2$ such seats. For either of these, there are then four empty seats in a row, and one empty seat between Rosa and Pierre. Thomas can sit in either of the middle two of the four empty seats in a row. So, there are $2\\cdot 2 = 4$ ways to seat Rosa and Thomas in this case. There are then $4$ seats left, which the others can take in $4! = 24$ ways. So, there are $4\\cdot 24 = 96$ seatings in this case.\n\nCase 2: Rosa is three seats from Pierre (that is, there are $2$ seats between them). There are $2$ such seats. Thomas can't sit in either of the $2$ seats directly between them, but after Rosa sits, there are $3$ empty seats in a row still, and Thomas can only sit in the middle seat of these three. Once again, there are $4$ empty seats remaining, and the $4$ remaining people can sit in them in $4! = 24$ ways. So, we have $2\\cdot 24 = 48$ seatings in this case.\n\nPutting our two cases together gives a total of $96+48 = \\boxed{144}$ seatings.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Fix a Position**\nSince we're dealing with a circular table, rotations are considered the same.  To avoid overcounting, let's fix one person's position.  Let's fix Pierre's position.\n**2.  Arrange the Other Two \"Special\" People**\n* Now we need to arrange Rosa and Thomas.  They cannot sit next to Pierre, so they must occupy two of the four remaining spots.  This can be done in  \u2074C\u2082 = 6 ways. \n**3.  Arrange the Remaining People**\n* The remaining four people can be arranged in the remaining four spots in 4! = 24 ways.\n**4.  The Total Number of Arrangements**\nTo find the total number of arrangements, we multiply the possibilities from each step: 6 ways * 24 ways = **144 ways**.\n**Therefore, there are 144 ways to arrange the 7 people around the table so that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas don't sit next to each other.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step by step:\n**1. Fix a Position:**\n* Since we're dealing with a circular table, we can fix one person's position without loss of generality. Let's fix Pierre's position.\n**2. Consider the Restrictions:**\n* Rosa and Thomas cannot sit next to Pierre.  This means they must sit in two of the remaining six positions.\n**3. Place Rosa:**\n* Rosa has five possible positions (she can't sit next to Pierre).\n**4. Place Thomas:**\n* Once Rosa is placed, there are four remaining positions where Thomas can sit without being next to Pierre or Rosa.\n**5. Place the Remaining People:**\n* The remaining four people can be arranged in the remaining four seats in $4!$ ways.\n**6. Avoid Overcounting:**\n* Since we're dealing with a circular table, we've overcounted by a factor of 7. This is because each seating arrangement can be rotated to create 7 identical arrangements.\n**7. Calculate the Total Arrangements:**\n* The total number of valid arrangements is:  (5 positions for Rosa) * (4 positions for Thomas) * (4! arrangements for the remaining people) / (7 rotations) = (5 * 4 * 24) / 7 = **68.57**\n**Since we can't have a fraction of an arrangement, we round down. There are **68** ways to seat the 7 people around the table with the given restriction.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Fix a Position:**\n* Since we're dealing with a circular table, we can fix one person's position without loss of generality. Let's fix Pierre's position.\n**2. Consider the Restrictions:**\n* Rosa and Thomas cannot sit next to Pierre. This means they must sit at least one seat away from Pierre.\n**3. Placement of Rosa and Thomas:**\n*  Let's consider the seats next to Pierre.  There are two possibilities:\n    * **Case 1: Both seats next to Pierre are empty.**  In this case, we have 4 remaining seats for Rosa and Thomas.  We can choose 2 of these seats for them in  \u2074C\u2082 = 6 ways.  Then, we can arrange Rosa and Thomas in these two seats in 2! = 2 ways. The remaining 4 people can be arranged in the remaining 4 seats in 4! = 24 ways. So, the total number of arrangements in Case 1 is 6 * 2 * 24 = 288.\n    * **Case 2: One of the seats next to Pierre is occupied by another person.** Let's say the seat to Pierre's right is occupied.  Then, the seat to Pierre's left must be empty. This leaves 3 seats for Rosa and Thomas, and they can be arranged in \u00b3C\u2082 * 2! = 12 ways. The remaining 4 people can be arranged in the remaining 4 seats in 4! = 24 ways. So, the total number of arrangements in Case 2 is 12 * 24 = 288.\n**4. Total Arrangements:**\n* Since Case 1 and Case 2 are mutually exclusive, we add the number of arrangements for each case to get the total number of arrangements: 288 + 288 = **576**\n**Therefore, there are 576 ways to seat the 7 people around the table so that no two of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit next to each other.** \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem step by step:\n**1.  Fix a Position:**\n* Since rotations are considered the same, let's fix Pierre's position. We can place him anywhere on the table.\n**2.  Consider the Other Two:**\n* Now, we need to arrange Rosa and Thomas so they are not next to Pierre. There are two spots next to Pierre, and these two spots must be filled by the other four people.\n**3.  Place the Remaining People:**\n* The remaining four people can be arranged in $4!$ ways. \n**4.  Place Rosa and Thomas:**\n* Now, we need to place Rosa and Thomas. They can't be next to Pierre, so they must occupy two of the four remaining spots.  There are $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways to choose these two spots.\n* Once we've chosen the spots, we can arrange Rosa and Thomas in $2!$ ways.\n**5.  Total Arrangements:**\n* The total number of arrangements is the product of the number of possibilities at each step: \n   \n   $4! \\times \\binom{4}{2} \\times 2! = 24 \\times 6 \\times 2 = \\boxed{288}$ \n",

Let's fix Pierre's position.\n**2. Arrange the Other Two Restricted People**\n*  Now, we need to place Rosa and Thomas so they aren't adjacent to Pierre. This means Rosa and Thomas must be separated by at least one other person.\n*  Imagine there are 5 \"slots\" around Pierre: two on either side of him and one directly across. Rosa and Thomas must occupy two of these slots. \n*  There are $\\binom{5}{2} = 10$ ways to choose these slots.\n**3. Arrange the Remaining People**\n*  We have 4 remaining people to fill the remaining 4 slots.\n*  These 4 people can be arranged in $4!$ ways (4*3*2*1 = 24 ways).\n**4. Adjust for Overcounting**\n*  Since we fixed Pierre's position, we've overcounted by a factor of 7.  We've counted each arrangement 7 times (for each of the 7 positions Pierre could have occupied).\n**5. Calculate the Final Answer**\nThe total number of valid seating arrangements is:\n(Number of ways to place Rosa and Thomas) * (Number of ways to arrange the remaining people) / (Overcounting factor)\n= 10 * 24 / 7 \n= **34.28**\nSince we can't have a fractional number of arrangements, we round down.
