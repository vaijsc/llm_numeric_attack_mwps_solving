    "solution": "We'll start with the naive estimate that there are $5^4=625$ colorings, since there are 5 choices for the color of each square. Obviously, some colorings will be counted more than once. Consider a general coloring and the three other colorings obtained by rotating it. If all four squares are the same color, in 5 of the 625 colorings, we get the same thing when we rotate it, so these are not overcounted. If opposite squares match but adjacent ones do not, then we get two colorings that should be counted together, so we are double-counting these $5\\cdot4=20$ colorings (there are 5 choices for one color and 4 for the other color). In the other $5^4-5-20=600$ cases, we quadruple-count the colorings, since there are four of the original colorings that are really the same. Therefore, the total number of distinct colorings is $$5+\\frac{20}2+\\frac{600}4=5+10+150=\\boxed{165}.$$[asy]\ndraw((0,0)--(1,0)--(1,1)--(0,1)--cycle); draw((.5,1)--(.5,0)); draw((.5,1)--(.5,1));\ndraw((2,0)--(3,0)--(3,1)--(2,1)--cycle); draw((2.5,1)--(2.5,0)); draw((2.5,1)--(2.5,0));\ndraw((4,0)--(5,0)--(5,1)--(4,1)--cycle); draw((4.5,1)--(4.5,0)); draw((4.5,1)--(4.5,0));\nfill((0,0)--(.5,0)--(.5,.5)--(0,.5)--cycle,red);\nfill((.5,0)--(1,0)--(1,.5)--(.5,.5)--cycle,red);\nfill((.5,.5)--(1,.5)--(1,1)--(.5,1)--cycle,red);\nfill((0,.5)--(.5,.5)--(.5,1)--(0,1)--cycle,red);\nfill((2,0)--(2.5,0)--(2.5,.5)--(2,.5)--cycle,red);\nfill((2.5,0)--(3,0)--(3,.5)--(2.5,.5)--cycle,blue);\nfill((2.5,.5)--(3,.5)--(3,1)--(2.5,1)--cycle,red);\nfill((2,.5)--(2.5,.5)--(2.5,1)--(2,1)--cycle,blue);\nfill((4,0)--(4.5,0)--(4.5,.5)--(4,.5)--cycle,blue);\nfill((4.5,0)--(5,0)--(5,.5)--(4.5,.5)--cycle,red);\nfill((4.5,.5)--(5,.5)--(5,1)--(4.5,1)--cycle,blue);\nfill((4,.5)--(4.5,.5)--(4.5,1)--(4,1)--cycle,yellow);\nlabel(\"5\",(.5,0),S);\nlabel(\"20\",(2.5,0),S);\nlabel(\"600\",(4.5,0),S);\n[/asy]",

        "Here's how we can solve this problem:\n**1.  Total Unrestricted Colorings**\n* We have 5 choices for the color of each of the four squares.\n* This gives us a total of 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 = **625** possible colorings without any restrictions.\n**2.  Accounting for Rotations**\n* **Rotation by 90 degrees:**  If we rotate the board by 90 degrees, we get a new coloring. However, this new coloring should be considered the same as the original.\n* **Rotation by 180 degrees:**  Rotating by 180 degrees also gives us a new coloring that should be considered the same. \n* **Rotation by 270 degrees:**  This rotation is equivalent to a 90-degree rotation in the opposite direction.\n**3.  Finding Distinct Colorings**\n* **Case 1: All squares the same color:** There are 5 ways to do this.\n* **Case 2: Two pairs of the same color:** There are 5 choices for the first color, 4 choices for the second color, and 3 ways to arrange these two colors (they can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal). This gives us 5 * 4 * 3 = 60 colorings.\n* **Case 3: Three squares of one color, one of another:** There are 5 choices for the color of the three squares, 4 choices for the remaining square, and 4 ways to arrange these (the single square can be in any of the four positions). This gives us 5 * 4 * 4 = 80 colorings.\n* **Case 4: All four squares different colors:** There are 5 choices for the first color, 4 choices for the second, 3 for the third, and 2 for the fourth.  However, we've overcounted because each coloring can be obtained through four rotations.  So, we divide by 4 to get (5 * 4 * 3 * 2) / 4 = 30 colorings.\n**4.  The Final Count**\nAdding up the colorings from each case, we have 5 + 60 + 80 + 30 = **175** distinct colorings. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1.  Count all possible colorings without considering rotations.**\nSince we have 5 colors and 4 squares, each square has 5 choices.  Therefore, there are $5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^4 = 625$ total possible colorings.\n**2.  Consider rotations.**\n* **Rotation by 90 degrees:** If we rotate the board by 90 degrees, some colorings will look the same. For example, if the top row is red-blue and the bottom row is blue-red, this is the same coloring after a 90-degree rotation.\n* **Rotation by 180 degrees:**  This rotation will also create duplicate colorings.\n* **Rotation by 270 degrees:**  This will also create duplicate colorings.\n**3.  Identify the distinct cases.**\nWe need to figure out how many times each distinct coloring is counted in our original 625.  Here's a way to categorize the distinct colorings:\n* **Case 1: All squares the same color.** There are 5 ways to do this (one for each color).\n* **Case 2: Two pairs of the same color.** There are $\\binom{5}{2} = 10$ ways to choose the two colors, and then 3 ways to arrange them (either both the top row are the same color, both the bottom row are the same color, or both columns are the same color). This gives us $10 \\times 3 = 30$ colorings.\n* **Case 3: Three squares the same color, one different.**  There are 5 ways to choose the dominant color, 4 ways to choose the different color, and then 4 ways to place the different color (it can be in any of the four squares). This gives us $5 \\times 4 \\times 4 = 80$ colorings.\n* **Case 4: All four squares different colors.** There are $5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 120$ ways to choose the colors, but each of these is counted 4 times (once for each rotation). So there are $120/4 = 30$ distinct colorings in this case.\n**4.  Calculate the final answer.**\nWe have a total of $5 + 30 + 80 + 30 = \\boxed{145}$ distinct colorings. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Total Possible Colorings:**\n* For each of the four squares, we have 5 color choices. \n* This gives us a total of 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 = 625 possible colorings.\n**2. Identifying Rotations:**\n* A 90-degree rotation of the board results in the same coloring.  \n* There are four possible rotations: 0 degrees, 90 degrees, 180 degrees, and 270 degrees.\n**3. Accounting for Rotations:**\n* For each unique coloring, there are 4 rotations that produce the same pattern. \n* Therefore, we've overcounted each unique coloring by a factor of 4.\n**4. Finding the Unique Colorings:**\n* To find the number of unique colorings, we divide the total number of colorings by 4: 625 / 4 = 156.25.\n**5. The Answer:**\n* Since we can't have a fraction of a coloring, we round up to the nearest whole number. There are **157** unique ways to color the 2x2 board. \n",

Total Possible Colorings (Without Rotations)**\n* For each of the four squares, we have 5 choices of color.\n* This gives us a total of 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 = 625 possible colorings.\n**2. Identifying Rotational Equivalences**\n* **90-degree rotation:** If we rotate the board 90 degrees, a coloring will be considered the same.\n* **180-degree rotation:** A 180-degree rotation also leads to the same coloring.\n* **270-degree rotation:**  A 270-degree rotation is equivalent to a 90-degree rotation.\n**3. Counting Distinct Colorings**\n* **All the same color:** There are 5 colorings where all squares are the same color (all red, all blue, etc.).\n* **Two colors, two of each:**  There are  \u2075C\u2082 = 10 ways to choose two colors.  For each choice, there's only one distinct coloring (since rotations will account for all arrangements).\n* **Two colors, three of one, one of the other:**  There are \u2075C\u2082 = 10 ways to choose the two colors.  For each choice, there are four distinct colorings (depending on which square has the single color).\n* **Four different colors:** There are \u2075C\u2084 = 5 ways to choose four colors. For each choice, there are only one distinct coloring (all rotations are the same).\n**4.

Accounting for Rotations**\n* **Rotation 1:**  A 90-degree clockwise rotation.  \n* **Rotation 2:** A 180-degree rotation.\n* **Rotation 3:** A 270-degree rotation.\nLet's consider some cases:\n* **Case 1: All squares the same color.** There are 5 ways to color all squares the same color (one for each color). Each of these colorings is unchanged by any rotation.\n* **Case 2: Two squares one color, two squares another color.**  There are $\\binom{5}{2} = 10$ ways to choose the two colors. For each choice of colors, there are 6 distinct colorings (we can have the same color on opposite squares, or on adjacent squares, which give different colorings after rotation).  However, each distinct coloring is counted 4 times (original and the 3 rotations). So, we need to divide by 4. This gives us $10 \\times 6 / 4 = 15$ colorings.\n* **Case 3: Three squares one color, one square another color.** There are $\\binom{5}{2} = 10$ ways to choose the colors. For each choice of colors, there are 4 distinct colorings (one for each possible position of the different colored square). Each coloring is counted 4 times, so we divide by 4.

However, each distinct coloring is counted 4 times (original and 3 rotations), so we need to divide by 4.  This gives us $120/4 = 30$ colorings.\n**3.
