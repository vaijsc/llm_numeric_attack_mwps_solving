    "solution": "In one flip, we have a $1/2$ chance of getting heads and winning 3 dollars, and a $1/2$ chance of getting tails and losing two dollars.  So the expected value of one flip is $E = \\frac{1}{2}(\\$3) + \\frac{1}{2}(-\\$2) = \\boxed{\\$0.50}$.",

        "Here's how to calculate the expected value:\n**1. Probabilities:**\n* **Heads:** The probability of flipping heads is 1/2 (or 50%).\n* **Tails:** The probability of flipping tails is also 1/2 (or 50%).\n**2. Payoffs:**\n* **Heads:** We win $3.\n* **Tails:** We lose $2 (which is the same as winning -$2).\n**3. Expected Value Calculation:**\nThe expected value is calculated as the sum of the products of each outcome's probability and its payoff. \n* **Expected Value = (Probability of Heads * Payoff of Heads) + (Probability of Tails * Payoff of Tails)**\n* **Expected Value = (1/2 * $3) + (1/2 * -$2)**\n* **Expected Value = $1.50 - $1.00**\n* **Expected Value = $0.50**\n**Therefore, the expected value of our winnings after one flip is $0.50.** \n",
