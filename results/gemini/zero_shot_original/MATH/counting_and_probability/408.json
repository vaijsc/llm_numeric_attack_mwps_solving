    "problem": "Our physics club has $20$ members, among which we have 3 officers: President, Vice President, and Treasurer.  However, one member, Alex, hates another member, Bob.  How many ways can we fill the offices if Alex refuses to serve as an officer if Bob is also an officer? (No person is allowed to hold more than one office.)",

    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The best way to approach this problem is to use complementary counting. We already know that there are $20 \\times 19 \\times 18$ ways to choose the 3 officers if we ignore the restriction about Alex and Bob.  So now we want to count the number of ways that both Alex and Bob serve as officers.\n\nFor this, we will use constructive counting.  We need to pick an office for Alex, then pick an office for Bob, then put someone in the last office.  We have 3 choices for an office for Alex, either President, VP, or Treasurer.  Once we pick an office for Alex, we have 2 offices left from which to choose an office for Bob.\n\nOnce we have both Alex and Bob installed in offices, we have 18 members left in the club to pick from for the remaining vacant office.  So there are $3 \\times 2 \\times 18$ ways to pick officers such that Alex and Bob are both in an office.  Remember that these are the cases that we want to exclude, so to finish the problem we subtract these cases from the total number of cases.  Hence the answer is: $$ (20 \\times 19 \\times 18) - (3 \\times 2 \\times 18) = ((20 \\times 19)-6) \\times 18 = 374 \\times 18 = \\boxed{6732}. $$",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step by step:\n**1. Total Possible Arrangements Without Restrictions**\n* There are 20 choices for President.\n* Once the President is chosen, there are 19 choices left for Vice President.\n* Finally, there are 18 choices for Treasurer.\nSo, the total number of ways to fill the offices without any restrictions is 20 * 19 * 18 = 6840.\n**2. Arrangements Where Alex and Bob Are Both Officers**\n* Let's consider the cases where both Alex and Bob are officers. \n* There are 2 choices for who is President (Alex or Bob).\n* Once the President is chosen, there's only 1 choice for the other officer (the remaining one out of Alex and Bob).\n* For the remaining Treasurer position, there are 18 choices (anyone except Alex and Bob).\nThis gives us 2 * 1 * 18 = 36 arrangements where Alex and Bob are both officers.\n**3. The Final Answer**\nTo find the number of arrangements where Alex and Bob are *not* both officers, we subtract the arrangements where they are both officers from the total number of arrangements:\n6840 - 36 = **6804**\n**Therefore, there are 6804 ways to fill the offices if Alex refuses to serve as an officer if Bob is also an officer.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Total Possible Arrangements Without Restrictions:**\n* If there were no restrictions, we have 20 choices for president, 19 choices for vice president (since one person is already president), and 18 choices for treasurer.  \n* This gives us a total of 20 * 19 * 18 = 6840 possible arrangements.\n**2. Arrangements Where Alex and Bob Both Serve:**\n* If both Alex and Bob serve, we have 2 choices for president (either Alex or Bob), 1 choice for vice president (the other of Alex or Bob), and 18 choices for treasurer (anyone else).\n* This gives us 2 * 1 * 18 = 36 arrangements where both Alex and Bob serve.\n**3. Arrangements Where Alex Refuses to Serve:**\n* We want to subtract the arrangements where both Alex and Bob serve from the total possible arrangements.\n* This gives us 6840 - 36 = 6804 arrangements where Alex refuses to serve if Bob is also an officer.\n**Therefore, there are 6804 ways to fill the offices with the given restriction.** \n",
