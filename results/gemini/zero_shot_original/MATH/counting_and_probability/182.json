        "Here's how to solve this problem step by step:\n**1. Prime Factorization of 15!**\nFirst, we need to find the prime factorization of 15!.  This means we need to figure out how many times each prime number appears in the product 15! = 15 * 14 * 13 * ... * 2 * 1.\n* **3:**  The multiples of 3 in the range 1 to 15 are 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15. This gives us 5 factors of 3. However, 9 (which is 3*3) has two factors of 3, and 12 (which is 2*2*3) also has one factor of 3. So, in total, 15! has 5 + 1 + 1 = **7** factors of 3.\n**2.  Finding the Highest Power of 3**\nWe want to find the largest power of 3 that divides 15!.  Since 15! has 7 factors of 3, the highest power of 3 that divides 15! is **3^7**.\n**3.  The Answer**\nSince 3^7 is a factor of 15!, and we want to know how many positive integer values of *n* make 3^n a factor, we can see that *n* can take on any value from 1 to 7.\n**Therefore, there are **7** positive integer values of *n* for which 3^n is a factor of 15!** \n",

Remember that:\n* 15! = 15 * 14 * 13 * 12 * ... * 2 * 1\n* Every multiple of 3 contributes a factor of 3.\n* Every multiple of 9 contributes an additional factor of 3.\n* Every multiple of 27 contributes yet another factor of 3, and so on.\n**2. Counting Factors of 3**\n* **Multiples of 3:**  There are 5 multiples of 3 between 1 and 15 (3, 6, 9, 12, 15)\n* **Multiples of 9:** There are 1 multiple of 9 between 1 and 15 (9)\n* **Multiples of 27:** There are no multiples of 27 between 1 and 15.\n**3. Total Power of 3**\nAdding up the factors of 3 from each category: 5 + 1 = 6\nThis means 15! has 6 factors of 3.  Therefore, the highest power of 3 that divides 15! is 3\u2076.\n**4. Positive Integer Values of n**\nSince 3\u2076 is the highest power of 3 that divides 15!, the possible values of *n* for which 3\u207f is a factor of 15! are:\n* n = 1\n* n = 2\n* n = 3\n* n = 4\n* n = 5\n* n = 6\n**Answer:** There are **6** positive integer values of *n* for which 3\u207f is a factor of 15!. \n",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**Understanding Factorials**\n* A factorial (denoted by !) means multiplying a number by all the positive integers less than it. For example, 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.\n*  15! = 15 * 14 * 13 * ... * 2 * 1\n**Finding the Highest Power of 3**\nTo find the highest power of 3 that divides 15!, we need to figure out how many times 3 appears as a factor in the prime factorization of 15!. \nHere's how:\n1. **Divisibility by 3:** Count the multiples of 3 from 1 to 15: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15. This gives us 5 multiples.\n2. **Divisibility by 9:**  Notice that some numbers (like 9) are divisible by 3 * 3.  We've already counted these once, so we need to count them again: 9. This adds 1 more multiple of 3.\n3. **Divisibility by 27:** There are no multiples of 27 within the numbers from 1 to 15.\n**Total Power of 3**\nAdding the counts from our steps: 5 + 1 = 6. This means 3 appears as a factor 6 times in the prime factorization of 15!. Therefore, the highest power of 3 that divides 15! is 3\u2076.\n**Answer**\nSince the highest power of 3 that divides 15! is 3\u2076, there are **6** positive integer values of *n* for which 3\u207f is a factor of 15!. \n",
