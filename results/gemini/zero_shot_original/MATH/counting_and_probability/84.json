    "problem": "A Senate committee has 5 Democrats, 5 Republicans, and 1 Independent.  In how many ways can they sit around a circular table if all the members of each party all sit next to each other?  (Two seatings are considered equivalent if one is a rotation of the other.)",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Choose any seat in which to place the Independent -- it doesn't matter which seat that we choose, since we can rotate the table. Once the Independent's seat has been chosen, either all the Democrats sit to their left and all the Republicans sit to their right, or the other way around. Either way, there are $5!$ ways to put the Democrats in their seats, and $5!$ ways to put the Republicans in their seats. So, the total number of ways to seat the people around the table is $2\\cdot5!\\cdot5!=2\\cdot120\\cdot120=\\boxed{28800}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Treat each party as a unit:**\n* Since the Democrats must sit together, consider them as a single unit. \n* Similarly, treat the Republicans and the Independent as separate units.\n**2. Arrange the units:**\n* We have 3 units to arrange around the circular table. \n*  There are (3-1)! = 2! = 2 ways to arrange these units in a circle. (Remember, circular arrangements have one fewer possibility than linear arrangements.)\n**3. Arrange individuals within each unit:**\n* **Democrats:** The 5 Democrats can be arranged within their unit in 5! = 120 ways.\n* **Republicans:**  The 5 Republicans can be arranged within their unit in 5! = 120 ways.\n* **Independent:** The Independent has only 1 way to arrange themselves.\n**4. Multiply to find the total arrangements:**\nTo get the total number of possible arrangements, multiply the number of ways to arrange the units by the number of ways to arrange individuals within each unit:\n2 ways (for units) * 120 ways (for Democrats) * 120 ways (for Republicans) * 1 way (for Independent) = **28,800**\n**Therefore, there are 28,800 ways to seat the committee members around a circular table if members of the same party must sit together.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Treat each party as a unit:**\nSince the members of each party must sit together, we can consider each party as a single unit. This means we have 3 units to arrange around the circular table: Democrats (D), Republicans (R), and the Independent (I).\n**2. Arrange the units:**\n* For a circular arrangement, we fix one unit's position and arrange the rest relative to it.  Let's fix the Democrats (D) as our starting point.\n* The remaining two units (R and I) can be arranged in 2! = 2 ways (RI or IR).\n**3. Arrange members within each party:**\n* **Democrats:** The 5 Democrats can be arranged within their group in 5! = 120 ways.\n* **Republicans:** Similarly, the 5 Republicans can be arranged in 5! = 120 ways.\n* **Independent:** There's only 1 way to arrange the single Independent.\n**4. Total Arrangements:**\nTo find the total number of arrangements, we multiply the possibilities for each step:\nTotal Arrangements = (Arrangements of units) * (Arrangements within Democrats) * (Arrangements within Republicans) * (Arrangements within Independent)\nTotal Arrangements = 2 * 120 * 120 * 1 = **28,800**\n**Therefore, there are 28,800 ways to arrange the Senate committee around a circular table if members of each party sit together.** \n",
