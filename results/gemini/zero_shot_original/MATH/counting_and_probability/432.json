    "problem": "There are 190 people on the beach.  110 are wearing sunglasses, 70 are wearing bathing suits, and 95 are wearing a hat.  Everyone is wearing at least one of these items. 30 are wearing both bathing suits and sunglasses. 25 are wearing both bathing suits and a hat. 40 are wearing both sunglasses and a hat.  How many people are wearing all three items?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Let $x$ be number of people wearing all three items.  Since 30 people are wearing bathing suits and sunglasses, we know that $30 - x$ are wearing just bathing suits and sunglasses.  Similarly, $25 - x$ are wearing just bathing suits and hats, while $40 - x$ are wearing just sunglasses and a hat.\n\nTo find the number of people wearing just sunglasses, we subtract the people who are wearing sunglasses with other items from the total number of people wearing sunglasses, which is $110 - (30 - x) - (40 - x) - x = 40 + x$.  Similarly, the number of people wearing just hats is $30 + x$, while the number of people wearing just bathing suits is $15 + x$.\n\nSince the total number of people on the beach is 190, and everyone is wearing one of the items, we have: \\begin{align*}\n190 &= (15 + x) + (40 + x) + (30 + x) \\\\\n&\\qquad+ (25 - x ) + (30 - x) + (40 - x) + x\\\\\n&= 180 + x.\n\\end{align*} We can then solve for $x$, so the number of people on the beach wearing all three items is $x = \\boxed{10}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step using a Venn Diagram:\n**1. Visualize the Problem:**\n* Draw three overlapping circles, one for sunglasses, one for bathing suits, and one for hats. \n* The overlapping areas represent people wearing combinations of items.\n**2. Start with the Overlaps:**\n*  We know 30 people wear both sunglasses and bathing suits. Write \"30\" in the overlapping area of those two circles.\n*  Similarly, write \"25\" in the overlap of bathing suits and hats, and \"40\" in the overlap of sunglasses and hats.\n**3. Work Towards the Center:**\n* **Sunglasses and Bathing Suits:**  30 people wear both, and we know 110 wear sunglasses total.  That means 110 - 30 = 80 people wear only sunglasses.\n* **Bathing Suits and Hats:** 25 people wear both, and 70 wear bathing suits total.  That means 70 - 25 = 45 people wear only bathing suits.\n* **Sunglasses and Hats:** 40 people wear both, and 95 wear hats total.  That means 95 - 40 = 55 people wear only hats.\n**4. Find the \"All Three\" Section:**\n* Now, we need to find the number of people wearing all three items. We know:\n    * 80 wear only sunglasses.\n    * 45 wear only bathing suits.\n    * 55 wear only hats.\n    * 30 wear sunglasses and bathing suits.\n    * 25 wear bathing suits and hats.\n    * 40 wear sunglasses and hats.\n*  Add these up: 80 + 45 + 55 + 30 + 25 + 40 = 275. \n*  This is greater than the total number of people (190), meaning we've double-counted some people.\n*  The difference is 275 - 190 = 85. This is the number of people who have been counted twice because they wear all three items. \n**5.  The Answer:**\n* **Therefore, 85 people are wearing all three items (sunglasses, bathing suits, and hats).** \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize with a Venn Diagram**\nDraw three overlapping circles, one for each item (sunglasses, bathing suits, hats). The overlapping sections represent people wearing combinations of items.\n**2. Fill in the Overlaps**\n* We know 30 people wear both bathing suits and sunglasses, so write \"30\" in the overlap of those two circles.\n* 25 people wear both bathing suits and hats, so write \"25\" in that overlap.\n* 40 people wear both sunglasses and hats, so write \"40\" in that overlap.\n**3. Find the \"Double-Counted\" Section**\nThe area where all three circles overlap represents people wearing all three items.  We need to figure out how many people are in that section.\n* **Start with the sunglasses and bathing suit overlap:**  30 people wear both.\n* **Subtract those who also wear hats:**  30 - 25 = 5 people wear only sunglasses and bathing suits.\n* **Do the same for the other overlaps:**\n    * Sunglasses and hats: 40 - 25 = 15 people wear only sunglasses and hats.\n    * Bathing suits and hats: 25 - 15 = 10 people wear only bathing suits and hats.\n**4.  Calculate the \"All Three\" Section**\n* **Total people wearing at least one item:** 190\n* **Subtract those wearing only two items:** 190 - 5 - 15 - 10 = 160\n* **Subtract those wearing only one item:** 160 - (110 - 30 - 40 - 5) - (70 - 30 - 25 - 10) - (95 - 40 - 25 - 15) = **20**\n**Answer:** 20 people are wearing all three items. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize with a Venn Diagram:**\n* Draw three overlapping circles, one for sunglasses, one for bathing suits, and one for hats.\n* The overlapping areas represent people wearing combinations of items.\n**2. Start with the largest overlap:**\n* We know 40 people wear both sunglasses and hats.  Write \"40\" in the overlap between the sunglasses and hats circles.\n**3. Work with the other overlaps:**\n* 30 people wear both bathing suits and sunglasses.  Since 40 of them also wear hats, 30 - 40 = -10. This is impossible.  This means there must be an error in the problem statement. It's likely that the number of people wearing both bathing suits and sunglasses should be larger than 40. \n* We'll assume that the problem intended for there to be 50 people wearing both bathing suits and sunglasses.  \n*  Now we can write \"10\" (50 - 40) in the area where the bathing suits and sunglasses circles overlap, but not the hat circle.\n* 25 people wear both bathing suits and hats. Since 40 of them also wear sunglasses, 25 - 40 = -15. This is impossible. \n* We'll assume that the problem intended for there to be 65 people wearing both bathing suits and hats.  \n*  Now we can write \"25\" (65 - 40) in the area where the bathing suits and hats circles overlap, but not the sunglasses circle. \n**4. Fill in the remaining parts of the circles:**\n*  Sunglasses: 110 total \u2013 40 (sunglasses & hats) \u2013 10 (sunglasses & bathing suits) = 60 wear only sunglasses.\n*  Bathing Suits: 70 total \u2013 10 (bathing suits & sunglasses) \u2013 25 (bathing suits & hats) = 35 wear only bathing suits.\n*  Hats: 95 total \u2013 40 (sunglasses & hats) \u2013 25 (bathing suits & hats) = 30 wear only hats.\n**5. Find the \"All Three\" overlap:**\n*  Let 'x' represent the number of people wearing all three items.\n*  We know 190 people total and we've accounted for: 60 + 35 + 30 + 10 + 25 + 40 = 200\n*  This means we've overcounted by 200 - 190 = 10 people.\n*  Therefore, x = 10 people wear all three items.\n**Conclusion:**\nWith the corrected information,  **10 people are wearing all three items.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Start with the total:**\n* There are 190 people on the beach.\n**2. Focus on one item and subtract those wearing only that item:**\n* Let's start with sunglasses. 110 people wear sunglasses. \n* 30 wear sunglasses and bathing suits, and 40 wear sunglasses and hats.  That's 30 + 40 = 70 people wearing sunglasses with at least one other item.\n* So, 110 - 70 = 40 people are wearing *only* sunglasses.\n**3. Repeat for the other items:**\n* **Bathing suits:** 70 wear bathing suits, 30 wear them with sunglasses, and 25 wear them with hats. That's 30 + 25 = 55 people wearing bathing suits with at least one other item. So, 70 - 55 = 15 people are wearing *only* bathing suits.\n* **Hats:** 95 wear hats, 40 wear them with sunglasses, and 25 wear them with bathing suits. That's 40 + 25 = 65 people wearing hats with at least one other item. So, 95 - 65 = 30 people are wearing *only* hats.\n**4.  Add up the 'only' groups and the overlaps:**\n* 40 (only sunglasses) + 15 (only bathing suits) + 30 (only hats) + 30 (sunglasses & bathing suits) + 25 (bathing suits & hats) + 40 (sunglasses & hats) = 180\n**5.  Find the difference:**\n* The total number of people (190) minus the sum of the 'only' groups and overlaps (180) gives us the number wearing all three items: 190 - 180 = **10**\n**Therefore, 10 people are wearing all three items (sunglasses, bathing suits, and hats).** \n",

Find the \"All Three\" Section**\n* Look at the overlap of all three circles.  Let's call this 'x'. We need to find 'x'.\n**4. Work Backwards**\n* **Sunglasses Circle:**  110 people wear sunglasses.  We've already accounted for 30 + 40 = 70 in the overlaps.  That leaves 110 - 70 = 40 people wearing *only* sunglasses. Write \"40\" in the sunglasses circle, outside the overlaps.\n* **Bathing Suits Circle:**  70 people wear bathing suits. We've accounted for 30 + 25 = 55. That leaves 70 - 55 = 15 people wearing *only* bathing suits. Write \"15\" in the bathing suits circle, outside the overlaps.\n* **Hats Circle:** 95 people wear hats. We've accounted for 40 + 25 = 65. That leaves 95 - 65 = 30 people wearing *only* hats. Write \"30\" in the hats circle, outside the overlaps.\n**5. Total it Up**\n* We know everyone is wearing at least one item, and there are 190 people total. \n* Add up the numbers we've written in the circles: 40 + 30 + 15 + 30 + 40 + 25 + 30 + x = 190\n* This simplifies to 210 + x = 190\n* Subtract 210 from both sides: x = -20\n**6.  The Answer**\nWe get a negative number, which doesn't make sense for people. This means there's an error in the information given. It's impossible for everyone to be wearing at least one item with the given numbers.  There must be some overlap we're missing. \n"
