    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Begin by constructing the number from the units digit and working up to the hundreds digit. There are two possible choices for the units digit: $3$ and $5$ (since the number must be odd). Then, after choosing that digit, there are three possible choices for the tens digit ($4$, $6$, and the remaining odd digit), since digits cannot be repeated. Finally, there are then two possible choices for the hundreds digit. Thus, there are $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 = \\boxed{12}$ such numbers that can be formed.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Determine the possibilities for the units digit:**\n* The number must be odd, so the units digit can only be 3 or 5.  We have **2** options.\n**2. Determine the possibilities for the hundreds digit:**\n* Since digits cannot be repeated, we have 3 digits left to choose from for the hundreds place. We have **3** options.\n**3. Determine the possibilities for the tens digit:**\n* We've used two digits already, leaving us with **2** options for the tens digit.\n**4. Calculate the total number of possibilities:**\n* To get the total number of different three-digit odd numbers, we multiply the number of options for each digit: 2 * 3 * 2 = **12**\n**Therefore, there are 12 different three-digit odd numbers that can be formed using the digits 3, 4, 5, and 6 without repetition.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Determine the Possibilities for the Units Digit**\n* The number must be odd, so the units digit (the last digit) can only be 3 or 5.  We have 2 choices.\n**2. Determine the Possibilities for the Hundreds Digit**\n* We've used one digit for the units place, so we have 3 digits remaining for the hundreds digit.\n**3. Determine the Possibilities for the Tens Digit**\n*  After using a digit for the hundreds place, we have 2 digits remaining for the tens place.\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Combinations**\n* To get the total number of possible three-digit odd numbers, we multiply the number of possibilities for each digit: 2 * 3 * 2 = **12**\n**Therefore, there are 12 different three-digit odd numbers that can be formed using the digits 3, 4, 5, and 6 without repeating digits.** \n",
