    "problem": "A box contains exactly five chips, three red and two white. Chips are randomly removed one at a time without replacement until all the red chips are drawn or all the white chips are drawn. What is the probability that the last chip drawn is white?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Think of continuing the drawing until all five chips are removed from the box. There are ten possible orderings of the colors: RRRWW, RRWRW, RWRRW, WRRRW, RRWWR, RWRWR, WRRWR, RWWRR, WRWRR, and WWRRR. The six orderings that end in R represent drawings that would have ended when the second white chip was drawn. Therefore, the probability that the last chip drawn is white if we stop at the last red or the last white is $6/10 = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{5}}.$\n\nOR\n\nImagine drawing until only one chip remains. If the remaining chip is red, then that draw would have ended when the second white chip was removed. The remaining chip will be red with probability $3/5,$ which means that the probability is $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{5}}$ that the last chip drawn from the box is white.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Consider the possible scenarios:**\n* **Scenario 1:  All red chips are drawn first.** \n    * This means the last chip drawn *must* be white.\n    *  To calculate the probability of this scenario, consider the order in which the chips could be drawn: RRRWW.  \n    *  The probability of this specific order is (3/5) * (2/4) * (1/3) * (2/2) * (1/1) = 1/10\n* **Scenario 2: All white chips are drawn first.**\n    * This means the last chip drawn *must* be red. \n    * To calculate the probability of this scenario, consider the order: WWRRR.\n    *  The probability of this specific order is (2/5) * (1/4) * (3/3) * (2/2) * (1/1) = 1/10\n**2. Determine the probability of the desired outcome:**\n* Since we want the probability that the last chip drawn is white, we're only interested in Scenario 1.\n* However,  there are different ways to order the chips that result in Scenario 1 (e.g., RWRRW, RRWRW). We need to account for these variations. \n*  The number of ways to arrange 3 red chips and 2 white chips is 5!/(3!2!) = 10.  This means there are 10 equally likely ways to draw the chips in Scenario 1.\n**3. Calculate the final probability:**\n*  The probability of Scenario 1 (drawing all red chips first) is 1/10 (as calculated earlier). \n*  Since there are 10 equally likely ways to achieve Scenario 1, the overall probability of drawing a white chip last is 1/10 * 10 = **1**.\n**Therefore, the probability that the last chip drawn is white is 1 (or 100%).** \n",

Determine the probability of the last chip being white:**\nSince the two scenarios are mutually exclusive (they can't both happen), the probability of the last chip being white is the probability of Scenario 1. \n**Therefore, the probability that the last chip drawn is white is 1/10.** \n",
