    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are $9!$ ways to put the beads on the grid, not taking rotations, reflections, and the restriction on the purple and green beads into account. We need to subtract off the number of arrangements where the purple and green beads are adjacent from this number. There are $2\\cdot3=6$ horizontally adjacent pairs of locations, $3\\cdot2=6$ vertically adjacent ones, and $2\\cdot2+2\\cdot2=8$ pairs of diagonally adjacent locations. For each of these pairs, there are two ways to put the purple and green beads in them, and $7!$ ways to put the rest of the beads on the grid, giving a total of $2(6+6+8)7!=40\\cdot7!$ invalid arrangements. So, the number of valid arrangements not counting rotations and reflections is $9!-40\\cdot7!=(9\\cdot8-40)7!=32\\cdot7!$. The grid can be rotated onto itself in four different ways, by rotations of 0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees. It can also be reflected onto itself in four different ways, by reflecting across its two diagonals and through horizontal and vertical lines through its center. So, the arrangements come in groups of $4+4=8$ equivalent arrangements, and the number of different arrangements is $32\\cdot7!/8=4\\cdot7!=\\boxed{20160}$.",

        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Understanding the Constraints:**\n* **Different Colors:**  Each of the 9 beads has a unique color.\n* **Adjacency Restriction:**  The purple and green beads cannot be placed next to each other in any direction (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).\n* **Symmetry:** Rotations and reflections of the grid are considered the same.\n**2.  Simplifying the Problem:**\n* **Fixing the Purple Bead:** Since we're considering symmetries, we can fix the purple bead in a specific location without loss of generality.  Let's place it in the center square.\n**3. Placing the Green Bead:**\n* **Forbidden Squares:**  Due to the adjacency restriction, the green bead cannot be placed in any of the eight squares surrounding the purple bead. This leaves us with only two possible locations for the green bead: the top-left corner and the bottom-right corner. These positions are equivalent under rotation.\n**4. Placing the Remaining Beads:**\n* **No Restrictions:** Now we have 7 beads left to place with no restrictions on their positions. \n**5. Calculating the Arrangements:**\n* **Total Possibilities:** We have 7 beads to place in 7 remaining squares. This gives us 7! (7 factorial) ways to arrange them.\n* **Symmetry Factor:** We need to account for the fact that rotations and reflections are considered the same. Since we have a 3x3 grid, each arrangement has 4 rotations and 4 reflections, giving us a total of 8 equivalent arrangements.\n**6. Final Calculation:**\nThe number of distinct ways to arrange the beads is: \n(7! / 8) = (5040 / 8) = **630**\n**Therefore, there are 630 ways to put 9 differently colored beads on a 3x3 grid with the given restrictions.** \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Total Arrangements without Restrictions**\n* Imagine the 9 spots on the grid. For the first spot, we have 9 choices of beads. For the second spot, we have 8 choices left, and so on.\n* This gives us a total of 9! = 362,880 possible arrangements if there were no restrictions.\n**2. Dealing with Rotations and Reflections**\n* We need to account for the fact that rotations and reflections are considered the same.  \n* A square has 4 rotational symmetries (0\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 180\u00b0, 270\u00b0).\n* A square has 4 reflectional symmetries (across each diagonal and across each horizontal/vertical line).\n* This means each unique arrangement is counted 8 times (4 rotations + 4 reflections).\n**3. Calculating Unique Arrangements**\n* To find the number of unique arrangements, we divide the total number of arrangements by 8: 362,880 / 8 = 45,360\n**4. Finding Arrangements Where Purple and Green are Adjacent**\n* Now, we need to find the number of arrangements where the purple and green beads *are* adjacent. \n* Treat the purple and green beads as a single unit. We now have 8 \"objects\" to arrange (7 beads + the purple/green unit).\n* These 8 objects can be arranged in 8! = 40,320 ways.\n* Since the purple and green beads can swap positions within their unit, we need to multiply this by 2: 40,320 * 2 = 80,640\n**5. Adjusting for Rotations and Reflections (Again)**\n* Similar to before, each of these arrangements where purple and green are adjacent is counted 8 times due to rotations and reflections.\n* So, we divide by 8: 80,640 / 8 = 10,080\n**6. The Final Calculation**\n* To find the number of arrangements where purple and green are *not* adjacent, we subtract the number of arrangements where they *are* adjacent from the total number of unique arrangements: 45,360 - 10,080 = **35,280**\n**Therefore, there are 35,280 ways to put the 9 beads on the grid with the purple and green beads not being adjacent, considering rotations and reflections as the same.** \n",
        "Here's a step-by-step solution to this problem:\n**1.  Understanding the Constraints**\n* **Distinct Beads:**  We have 9 unique beads, meaning each position on the grid can be filled with a different bead.\n* **No Adjacent Purple and Green:** This is the key restriction. The purple and green beads cannot be next to each other in any direction.\n**2.  Simplifying the Problem**\nSince rotations and reflections are considered the same, we can focus on finding arrangements in just one orientation.  For example, let's fix the purple bead in the top-left corner. This reduces the complexity of our counting.\n**3. Placing the Green Bead**\n* **Forbidden Positions:** Due to the adjacency rule, there are only a few positions where the green bead can be placed:\n    * The bottom-right corner.\n    * The center square.\n* **Case 1: Green Bead in the Bottom-Right Corner**\n    * This leaves 7 remaining positions for the other beads.\n    * There are 7! (7 factorial) ways to arrange the remaining 7 beads in the empty spots. \n* **Case 2: Green Bead in the Center**\n    * This also leaves 7 remaining positions for the other beads.\n    * There are 7! ways to arrange the remaining 7 beads.\n**4. Avoiding Overcounting**\n* We've counted arrangements where the purple bead is fixed in the top-left corner.  \n* To account for all possible orientations, we need to multiply our count by 4, since the purple bead can be placed in any of the 4 corner positions of the grid (and the green bead's position will adjust accordingly).\n**5.  Calculation**\n* **Total Arrangements:** (4 * 7!) + (4 * 7!) = 8 * 7! = 8 * 5040 = **40,320**\n**Therefore, there are 40,320 ways to arrange the 9 beads on the 3x3 grid with the given restrictions.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Consider the Purple and Green Beads**\n* **Start with the purple bead.** It can go in any of the 9 spots.\n* **Now consider the green bead.** It can't be next to the purple bead, so there are fewer possible locations.  Let's figure out how many:\n    * **If the purple bead is in a corner:** The green bead has 5 possible locations.\n    * **If the purple bead is on an edge (not a corner):** The green bead has 4 possible locations.\n    * **If the purple bead is in the center:** The green bead has 4 possible locations.\n**2.  Place the Remaining Beads**\n* Now we have 7 beads left to place.  Since we're only considering the purple and green bead restriction, we can place the rest of the beads freely.\n* For the first remaining bead, we have 7 choices.\n* For the second remaining bead, we have 6 choices.\n* And so on, until we have 1 choice for the last bead.\n**3.  Account for Rotations and Reflections**\n* We've overcounted because rotations and reflections of the grid are considered the same.\n* Each arrangement has 8 possible rotations and reflections (including itself). \n**4. Calculate the Final Count**\nLet's put everything together:\n* **Case 1: Purple in a corner** \n    * 9 (choices for purple) * 5 (choices for green) * 7! (choices for remaining beads) / 8 (rotations/reflections)\n* **Case 2: Purple on an edge**\n    * 9 (choices for purple) * 4 (choices for green) * 7! (choices for remaining beads) / 8 (rotations/reflections)\n* **Case 3: Purple in the center**\n    * 9 (choices for purple) * 4 (choices for green) * 7! (choices for remaining beads) / 8 (rotations/reflections)\n**Final Answer:**\nTo get the total number of ways, we add the counts from each case:\n(9 * 5 * 7! / 8) + (9 * 4 * 7! / 8) + (9 * 4 * 7! / 8) = **40,824** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Consider the Purple Bead:**\n* There are 9 possible positions for the purple bead.\n**2.  Consider the Green Bead:**\n* Since the green bead can't be adjacent to the purple bead, we need to count the positions that are *not* adjacent. \n* For each possible position of the purple bead, there are 4 positions that are adjacent to it (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally). \n* This leaves 5 positions for the green bead.\n**3.  Place the Remaining Beads:**\n* We've placed the purple and green beads. There are 7 remaining beads to be placed. \n* The remaining beads can be placed in any of the remaining 7 positions in any order.\n* This gives us 7! (7 factorial) ways to place the remaining beads.\n**4.  Account for Rotations and Reflections:**\n* We've counted each arrangement multiple times because of rotations and reflections.\n* A 3x3 grid can be rotated 4 times (0\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 180\u00b0, 270\u00b0) and reflected in 4 different ways. \n* This means we've overcounted each unique arrangement by a factor of 8.\n**5.  Calculate the Final Answer:**\n* **Total arrangements:** 9 * 5 * 7! \n* **Divide by overcounting:** (9 * 5 * 7!) / 8\n* **Simplify:** 945 * 7! = **1,995,840**\n**Therefore, there are 1,995,840 ways to put 9 differently colored beads on a 3x3 grid with the restrictions given.** \n"
