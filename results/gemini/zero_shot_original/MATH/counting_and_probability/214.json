    "solution": "The probability that Phillip flips $k$ heads is $$\\binom8k\\left(\\frac23\\right)^k\\left(\\frac13\\right)^{8-k}=\\frac1{3^8}\\binom8k2^k,$$  since there are $\\binom{8}{k}$ ways that $k$ out of $8$ coins will come up heads, and each of these arrangements of $k$ heads out of $8$ coins occurs with probability $\\left(\\frac23\\right)^k\\left(\\frac13\\right)^{8-k}$.

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Determine the Probabilities of Heads and Tails:**\n* Since the coin is twice as likely to land on heads as tails, we can represent the probability of tails as *x*.\n* The probability of heads is then *2x*.\n* The total probability must equal 1, so:  x + 2x = 1\n* Solving for x: 3x = 1,  x = 1/3\n* Therefore, the probability of tails is 1/3, and the probability of heads is 2/3.\n**2. Calculate the Probability of Getting Exactly Three Heads:**\n* We can use the binomial probability formula: \n   P(exactly k successes in n trials) = (n choose k) * p^k * q^(n-k)\n    * where: \n        * n = number of trials (8 coin flips)\n        * k = number of successes (3 heads)\n        * p = probability of success (2/3, probability of heads)\n        * q = probability of failure (1/3, probability of tails)\n        * (n choose k) = the binomial coefficient, calculated as n! / (k! * (n-k)!)\n* Plugging in the values:\n    P(exactly 3 heads) = (8 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^5 = 56 * (8/27) * (1/243) = 112/6561\n**3. Calculate the Probability of Getting Exactly Two Heads:**\n* Using the same formula:\n    P(exactly 2 heads) = (8 choose 2) * (2/3)^2 * (1/3)^6 = 28 * (4/9) * (1/729) = 112/6561\n**4. Find the Ratio of Probabilities:**\n* The ratio of the probability of getting exactly three heads to the probability of getting exactly two heads is:\n    (112/6561) / (112/6561) = 1\n**Answer:** Phillip is **1 time** as likely to get exactly three heads than exactly two heads. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Determine the Probability of Heads and Tails:**\n* Since the coin is twice as likely to land on heads, let's say the probability of tails is  *p*. \n* The probability of heads is then *2p*.\n* The sum of probabilities for heads and tails must equal 1:  *p + 2p = 1*\n* Solving for *p*, we get *p = 1/3*.  This means the probability of tails is 1/3, and the probability of heads is 2/3.\n**2. Calculate the Probability of Exactly Two Heads:**\n* We'll use the binomial probability formula:  P(exactly k successes in n trials) = (nCk) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k) \n* Where:\n    * n = number of trials (8 coin flips)\n    * k = number of successes (2 heads)\n    * p = probability of success (2/3 for heads)\n    * nCk = the binomial coefficient, calculated as n! / (k! * (n-k)!)\n* Plugging in the values: P(exactly 2 heads) = (8C2) * (2/3)^2 * (1/3)^6 = 28 * (4/9) * (1/729) = 112/6561\n**3. Calculate the Probability of Exactly Three Heads:**\n* Using the same formula: P(exactly 3 heads) = (8C3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^5 = 56 * (8/27) * (1/243) = 448/6561\n**4. Find the Ratio of Probabilities:**\n* Divide the probability of getting exactly three heads by the probability of getting exactly two heads: (448/6561) / (112/6561) = 4\n**Answer:** Phillip is **4 times** as likely to get exactly three heads than exactly two heads. \n",
        "Here's how to break down the problem:\n**1. Probability of Heads and Tails**\n* Since the coin is twice as likely to land on heads, let's say the probability of tails is *p*. \n* The probability of heads is then *2p*.\n* Since the probabilities must add up to 1, we have: *p + 2p = 1*\n* Solving for *p*, we get: *p = 1/3* \n* So, the probability of tails is 1/3, and the probability of heads is 2/3.\n**2. Calculating the Probabilities**\n* **Exactly three heads:**  This can be calculated using the binomial probability formula.  \n   * The formula is: (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n   * Where:\n      * n = number of trials (8 flips)\n      * k = number of successes (3 heads)\n      * p = probability of success (heads, 2/3)\n   * So, the probability of exactly three heads is: (8 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^5 \n* **Exactly two heads:**  We use the same formula, just changing *k* to 2.\n   * The probability of exactly two heads is: (8 choose 2) * (2/3)^2 * (1/3)^6\n**3. Finding the Ratio**\nTo find out how many times more likely Phillip is to get three heads than two heads, we need to divide the probability of three heads by the probability of two heads:\n[(8 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^5] / [(8 choose 2) * (2/3)^2 * (1/3)^6]\n**4. Simplifying**\n* (8 choose 3) = 56\n* (8 choose 2) = 28\n* The (2/3) and (1/3) terms simplify nicely.\nThis leaves us with: (56 * 2) / 28 = **4**\n**Answer:** Phillip is **4 times** more likely to get exactly three heads than exactly two heads. \n",
