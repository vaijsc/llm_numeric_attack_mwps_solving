        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Words starting with A:**\n*  There are 3 possibilities for the second letter (A, B, or C) and 3 possibilities for the third letter, giving us 3 * 3 = 9 words.\n**2. Words starting with B:**\n*  There are 3 possibilities for the second letter (A, B, or C) and 3 possibilities for the third letter, giving us 3 * 3 = 9 words.\n**3. Words starting with C:**\n*  There are 3 possibilities for the second letter (A, B, or C) and 3 possibilities for the third letter, giving us 3 * 3 = 9 words.\n**4. Finding the position of BAB:**\n* Since we've listed the words in alphabetical order, we know that all the words starting with A come before any words starting with B. \n* Within the words starting with B, the words with A as the second letter come before the words with B as the second letter. \n*  Therefore, BAB is the second word within the group of words starting with B.\n**5. Calculating the position:**\n*  The first 9 words start with A. \n*  The next 9 words start with B.\n*  Since BAB is the second word starting with B, it is the 10th (9 + 1) word on the list. \n**Therefore, the word BAB will be the 10th word on the list.** \n",
        "Here's how to figure out the position of \"BAB\" on the list:\n**1.  Break Down the Possibilities**\n* **Words starting with A:**  There are 3 possibilities for the second letter (A, B, or C) and 3 possibilities for the third letter, giving us 3 * 3 = 9 words starting with A.\n* **Words starting with B:**  There are 3 possibilities for the second letter (A, B, or C) and 3 possibilities for the third letter, giving us 3 * 3 = 9 words starting with B.\n**2. Find BAB's Position**\n* The words starting with A will be numbered 1 through 9.\n* The words starting with B will be numbered 10 through 18.\n* Since \"BAB\" is the second word starting with B, it will be numbered **11**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Categorize the Words**\n* **Words starting with A:**  AAA, AAB, AAC, ABA, ABB, ABC, ACA, ACB, ACC (9 words)\n* **Words starting with B:**  BAA, BAB, BAC, BBA, BBB, BBC, BCA, BCB, BCC (9 words)\n* **Words starting with C:**  CAA, CAB, CAC, CBA, CBB, CBC, CCA, CCB, CCC (9 words)\n**2. Find the Position of BAB**\n* Since there are 9 words starting with A, and BAB comes after all the words starting with A, it will be in the second group of words (words starting with B).\n*  Within the words starting with B, BAB is the second word alphabetically (after BAA).\n**3. Calculate the Position**\n*  There are 9 words before the words starting with B.\n*  BAB is the second word within the words starting with B. \n*  Therefore, BAB is the 9 + 2 = **11th** word on the list. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Organize by the first letter:**\n* **Words starting with A:** AAA, AAB, AAC, ABA, ABB, ABC, ACA, ACB, ACC (9 words)\n* **Words starting with B:**  BAA, BAB, BAC, BBA, BBB, BBC, BCA, BCB, BCC (9 words)\n* **Words starting with C:**  CAA, CAB, CAC, CBA, CBB, CBC, CCA, CCB, CCC (9 words)\n**2.  Locate BAB:**\n* Notice that all the words starting with \"A\" come before \"B\" in alphabetical order. \n*  We've already listed 9 words that start with \"A.\"\n*  Within the words starting with \"B,\"  \"BAB\" is the second word alphabetically.\n**3.  Calculate the position:**\n*  Since there are 9 words starting with \"A,\" and \"BAB\" is the second word starting with \"B,\" the position of \"BAB\" is 9 + 2 = **11**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this step-by-step:\n**1. Count the words starting with A:**\n* There are 3 possibilities for the second letter (A, B, or C).\n* There are 3 possibilities for the third letter (A, B, or C).\n* This gives us 3 * 3 = 9 words starting with A.\n**2. Count the words starting with B:**\n* There are 3 possibilities for the second letter (A, B, or C).\n* There are 3 possibilities for the third letter (A, B, or C).\n* This gives us 3 * 3 = 9 words starting with B.\n**3.  Find the position of BAB:**\n* Since the words are in alphabetical order, the words starting with B will come after the words starting with A. \n* Within the words starting with B, the order is \"BAA\", \"BAB\", \"BAC\", \"BBA\", \"BBB\", \"BBC\", \"BCA\", \"BCB\", \"BCC\".\n*  Therefore, \"BAB\" is the second word starting with B.\n**4. Calculate the total position:**\n* The words starting with A take up positions 1-9. \n* The word \"BAB\" is the second word starting with B, so it occupies position 9 + 2 = **11**.\n**Therefore, the word \"BAB\" will be in position 11 on the list.** \n"
