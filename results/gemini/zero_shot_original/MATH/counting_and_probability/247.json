        "Here's how to solve this problem step by step:\n**1. Understand the Requirements**\nWe need to find 4-digit numbers where the last digit is the sum of the first two digits.  Let's represent the digits as:\n* **Thousands digit:**  _a_\n* **Hundreds digit:** _b_\n* **Tens digit:** _c_ \n* **Units digit:** _d_\nThis means we need to find numbers that follow the pattern: _abcd_  where _d_ = _a_ + _b_.\n**2. Consider the Possible Values**\n* **_a_ (Thousands Digit):**  _a_ can be any digit from 1 to 9 (since it's the first digit of a 4-digit number).\n* **_b_ (Hundreds Digit):** _b_ can also be any digit from 0 to 9.\n* **_d_ (Units Digit):** _d_ is determined by the sum _a_ + _b_. It needs to be a single digit, so the maximum value of _a_ + _b_ is 18.\n**3. Count the Possibilities**\nLet's systematically count the combinations:\n* **If _a_ = 1:** \n    * _b_ can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 (10 possibilities)\n    * This gives us 10 possible numbers (1010, 1111, 1212, ... 1919)\n* **If _a_ = 2:**\n    * _b_ can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 (9 possibilities)\n    * This gives us 9 possible numbers (2020, 2121, 2222, ... 2828)\n* **If _a_ = 3:**\n    * _b_ can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 (8 possibilities)\n    * This gives us 8 possible numbers (3030, 3131, 3232, ... 3737)\n* **... and so on**\nYou'll notice a pattern:  Each time _a_ increases, the number of possibilities for _b_ decreases by one.\n* **If _a_ = 9:**\n    * _b_ can only be 0 (1 possibility)\n    * This gives us 1 possible number (9090)\n**4. Calculate the Total**\nTo find the total number of 4-digit numbers, we add up the possibilities for each value of _a_:\n10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = **55**\n**Therefore, there are 55 four-digit numbers that have the last digit equal to the sum of the first two digits.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Understand the Pattern**\nWe need to find numbers of the form _ _ _ (sum of first two digits), where the blank spaces represent digits.\n**2.  Break Down the Possibilities**\n* **The Hundreds Digit:** It can be any digit from 1 to 9 (it can't be 0, otherwise, it wouldn't be a 4-digit number).\n* **The Tens Digit:**  It can be any digit from 0 to 9.\n* **The Units Digit:** It's determined by the sum of the hundreds and tens digit.\n**3.  Calculate the Possibilities**\n* **Hundreds Digit:** 9 choices\n* **Tens Digit:** 10 choices\n* **Units Digit:** Determined by the first two digits, so 1 choice for each combination of the first two digits.\n**4.  Total Possibilities**\nSince the units digit is determined by the first two digits, we have 9 choices for the hundreds digit and 10 choices for the tens digit.  Therefore, there are 9 * 10 = **90** possible four-digit numbers that meet the given condition. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Structure**\nWe're looking for 4-digit numbers of the form: _ _ _ _ \n* The last digit (the fourth digit) is the sum of the first two digits.\n**2. Consider the Possibilities**\n* **First Digit:**  It can be any digit from 1 to 9 (it can't be 0, otherwise it wouldn't be a 4-digit number).\n* **Second Digit:** It can also be any digit from 0 to 9. \n* **Third Digit:** This digit is determined by the first two digits.\n**3. Calculate the Combinations**\n* **First Digit:** We have 9 choices (1 to 9).\n* **Second Digit:** We have 10 choices (0 to 9). \nSince the third digit is determined, we don't need to consider it separately. \nTherefore, the total number of possible 4-digit numbers is 9 * 10 = **90**.\n**So, there are 90 four-digit numbers that have the last digit equal to the sum of the first two digits.** \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem:\n**1. Understanding the Conditions**\nWe need to find 4-digit numbers where:\n* The last digit is the sum of the first two digits.\n**2. Representing the Digits**\nLet's represent the digits as follows:\n* **Thousands digit:**  _a_\n* **Hundreds digit:** _b_\n* **Tens digit:** _c_\n* **Units digit:** _d_\n**3. Setting up the Equation**\nThe condition given can be written as an equation:\n_d_ = _a_ + _b_\n**4. Finding Possible Values**\n* **a and b:**  Since _a_ and _b_ are digits, they can range from 0 to 9. \n* **d:** Since _d_ is the sum of _a_ and _b_, it can range from 0 to 18. However, since _d_ is a single digit, we only consider values from 0 to 9.\n**5. Analyzing the Equation**\nLet's analyze the equation _d_ = _a_ + _b_ by considering different possibilities for _d_:\n* **If _d_ = 0:**  The only possible combination is _a_ = 0 and _b_ = 0. This gives us one number: 0000.  (We'll discard this since it's not a 4-digit number.)\n* **If _d_ = 1:** The only possible combinations are _a_ = 0 and _b_ = 1, or _a_ = 1 and _b_ = 0. This gives us two numbers: 0101 and 1001.\n* **If _d_ = 2:** The possible combinations are _a_ = 0 and _b_ = 2, _a_ = 1 and _b_ = 1, or _a_ = 2 and _b_ = 0. This gives us three numbers: 0202, 1102, and 2002.\n* **If _d_ = 3:** We can find four possible numbers.\n* **If _d_ = 4:** We can find five possible numbers.\n* **If _d_ = 5:** We can find six possible numbers.\n* **If _d_ = 6:** We can find seven possible numbers.\n* **If _d_ = 7:** We can find eight possible numbers.\n* **If _d_ = 8:** We can find nine possible numbers.\n* **If _d_ = 9:** We can find ten possible numbers.\n**6. Counting the Numbers**\nTo get the total number of 4-digit numbers that satisfy the condition, we add up the possibilities for each value of _d_:\n2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = **54**\n**Therefore, there are 54 four-digit numbers that have the last digit equal to the sum of the first two digits.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step by step:\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\nWe need to find all four-digit numbers where the last digit is equal to the sum of the first two digits. For example, 1235 works because 1 + 2 = 3.\n**2. Setting up the Digits**\n* Let the first digit be represented by 'a'.\n* Let the second digit be represented by 'b'.\n* The third digit (since it has to be the sum of the first two) is 'a + b'.\n* The fourth digit (the last digit) is also 'a + b'.\n**3. Finding the Possible Values**\n*  The first digit (a) can range from 1 to 9 (since it's the first digit of a four-digit number).\n* The second digit (b) can also range from 0 to 9.\n**4. Evaluating Possibilities**\nWe need to consider the following:\n* **Maximum Value:** The maximum sum of the first two digits (a + b) is 18 (when a = 9 and b = 9).  \n* **Minimum Value:** The minimum sum is 1 (when a = 1 and b = 0).\n* **Digit Limit:** The sum (a + b) can't be greater than 9 because we only have single-digit numbers. \n**5. Counting the Numbers**\nLet's list the possible sums and the corresponding values of 'a' and 'b':\n* **Sum = 1:**  a = 1, b = 0  (1011)\n* **Sum = 2:**  a = 1, b = 1 (1122)\n* **Sum = 3:**  a = 1, b = 2 (1233)\n* **Sum = 4:**  a = 1, b = 3 (1344)\n* **Sum = 5:**  a = 1, b = 4 (1455)\n* **Sum = 6:**  a = 1, b = 5 (1566), a = 2, b = 4 (2466)\n* **Sum = 7:**  a = 1, b = 6 (1677), a = 2, b = 5 (2577)\n* **Sum = 8:**  a = 1, b = 7 (1788), a = 2, b = 6 (2688), a = 3, b = 5 (3588)\n* **Sum = 9:**  a = 1, b = 8 (1899), a = 2, b = 7 (2799), a = 3, b = 6 (3699), a = 4, b = 5 (4599)\n**6.
