    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "We will consider this as a composite of two problems with two indistinguishable balls and 3 distinguishable boxes.  For two indistinguishable green balls, we can place the balls in a box together or in separate boxes.  There are $3$ options to arrange them together (in box 1, 2, or 3) and $3$ options for placing them separately (nothing in box 1, 2, or 3).  So there are 6 ways to arrange the indistinguishable green balls.  By the same reasoning, there are 6 ways to arrange the indistinguishable red balls, for a total of $6 \\times 6 = \\boxed{36}$ arrangements of the 4 balls.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Consider the green balls:**\n* **Case 1: Both green balls in the same box:**  There are 3 choices for the box.\n* **Case 2: Green balls in different boxes:**  There are 3 choices for the first green ball and 2 choices for the second green ball.  However, we've overcounted since the order we choose the boxes doesn't matter (green in box 1 then box 2 is the same as green in box 2 then box 1). So, we need to divide by 2. This gives us (3 * 2) / 2 = 3 ways to place the green balls.\n**2. Consider the red balls:**\n* Now, we've already placed the green balls.  For each arrangement of green balls, we have the same options for placing the red balls:\n    * **Case 1: Both red balls in the same box:**  There are 3 choices for the box.\n    * **Case 2: Red balls in different boxes:**  There are 3 choices for the first red ball and 2 choices for the second.  Again, we need to divide by 2 to avoid overcounting, giving us (3 * 2) / 2 = 3 ways to place the red balls.\n**3. Combine the possibilities:**\n* For each way to place the green balls, there are 3 ways to place the red balls. So, we multiply the number of possibilities together.\n**Total number of ways:**\n* (3 ways for green balls in the same box) * (3 ways for red balls) = 9\n* (3 ways for green balls in different boxes) * (3 ways for red balls) = 9\nTherefore, there are a total of 9 + 9 = **18 ways** to place the balls in the boxes. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Consider the Green Balls:**\n* **Case 1: Both green balls in one box:**  There are 3 ways to choose which box.\n* **Case 2: One green ball in each of two boxes:** There are 3 choices for the first green ball and then 2 choices left for the second green ball, giving 3 * 2 = 6 ways. But since the order we place the green balls doesn't matter (placing one in box 1 then the other in box 2 is the same as the reverse), we need to divide by 2.  So there are 6 / 2 = 3 ways.\n**2. Consider the Red Balls:**\n* For each arrangement of the green balls, we need to consider the arrangements of the red balls. The logic is the same as with the green balls:\n    * Both red balls in one box: 3 ways\n    * One red ball in each of two boxes: 3 ways\n**3. Combine the Possibilities**\n* **Scenario 1:**  Both green balls in one box AND both red balls in one box.  This can happen in 3 ways (green) * 3 ways (red) = 9 ways.\n* **Scenario 2:**  Both green balls in one box AND one red ball in each of two boxes. This can happen in 3 ways (green) * 3 ways (red) = 9 ways.\n* **Scenario 3:**  One green ball in each of two boxes AND both red balls in one box. This can happen in 3 ways (green) * 3 ways (red) = 9 ways.\n* **Scenario 4:** One green ball in each of two boxes AND one red ball in each of two boxes. This can happen in 3 ways (green) * 3 ways (red) = 9 ways.\n**4. Total Ways**\nAdd up the possibilities from each scenario: 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 = **36 ways**\n**Therefore, there are 36 ways to put 4 balls (2 green, 2 red) into 3 distinguishable boxes.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Consider the green balls:**\n* **Case 1: Both green balls in the same box:** There are 3 choices for this box (box 1, box 2, or box 3).\n* **Case 2: Green balls in different boxes:**  There are 3 choices for the first green ball, and then 2 choices for the second green ball.  However, we've overcounted since the order we choose the boxes doesn't matter (putting a green ball in box 1 then box 2 is the same as box 2 then box 1). So, we divide by 2. This gives us (3 * 2) / 2 = 3 ways.\n**2. Consider the red balls:**\n* Now we have the same situation as with the green balls. We have 3 ways to put both red balls in the same box, and 3 ways to put them in different boxes.\n**3. Combine the possibilities:**\n* For each arrangement of the green balls, there are 6 possible arrangements for the red balls (3 + 3).\n* Since we have 6 ways to arrange the green balls (3 + 3), we multiply to find the total number of arrangements: 6 * 6 = **36**\n**Therefore, there are 36 ways to put 4 balls in 3 boxes with the given conditions.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Cases based on the number of green balls:**\n* **Case 1: All 2 green balls in one box:**\n    * We have 3 choices for which box to put the green balls.\n    * The red balls can be distributed in any way among the remaining 2 boxes.  This is like having 2 red balls and 2 \"boxes\" (since one box already has the green balls).  We can represent this as \"RR\" (both in the same box), \"R  R\" (one in each of the remaining boxes).  So there are 2 ways to distribute the red balls.\n* **Case 2: One green ball in one box, one in another box:**\n    * We have 3 choices for the first green ball and then 2 choices for the second green ball.  \n    * The red balls can be distributed in any way among the 3 boxes.  This is like having 2 red balls and 3 \"boxes.\" We can represent this as \"RR\", \"R  R\", \"R   R\".  There are 3 ways to distribute the red balls.\n**2. Total possibilities:**\n* **Case 1:** 3 choices for green * 2 choices for red = 6 possibilities\n* **Case 2:** 3 choices for green * 2 choices for green * 3 choices for red = 18 possibilities\n**3. Total:**\n* 6 possibilities (Case 1) + 18 possibilities (Case 2) = **24 total ways**\n**Therefore, there are 24 ways to put 4 balls (2 green, 2 red) into 3 distinguishable boxes.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Consider the green balls:**\n* You have 3 boxes, and you need to place 2 green balls.\n* You can think of this as choosing 2 boxes out of 3. \n* This can be done in  \u00b3C\u2082 ways (3 choose 2), which is 3!/(2!1!) = 3.\n**2. Consider the red balls:**\n* Now you have the remaining boxes. Since the boxes are distinguishable, the placement of the red balls is automatically determined. There's only one way to place them.\n**3. Total possibilities:**\n* Multiply the possibilities for placing the green balls and the red balls: 3 * 1 = 3\n**Therefore, there are 3 ways to put 4 balls in 3 boxes with the given conditions.** \n"
