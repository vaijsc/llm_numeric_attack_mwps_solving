    "solution": "There are 4 ways to choose the first card to be an Ace, then 3 ways to choose the second card to be another Ace.  There are $52 \\times 51$ ways to choose any two cards.  So the probability is $\\dfrac{4 \\times 3}{52 \\times 51} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{221}}$.",

        "Here's how to break down the probability calculation step-by-step:\n**1. Probability of the First Card Being an Ace**\n* There are 4 Aces in a deck of 52 cards.\n* The probability of drawing an Ace as the top card is 4/52, which simplifies to 1/13.\n**2. Probability of the Second Card Being an Ace (Given the First Was an Ace)**\n* After removing one Ace, there are only 3 Aces left.\n* There are also only 51 cards remaining in the deck.\n* The probability of drawing another Ace as the second card is 3/51, which simplifies to 1/17.\n**3. Combined Probability**\n* To get the probability of both events happening, we multiply the individual probabilities:\n   (1/13) * (1/17) = 1/221\n**Therefore, the probability of the top two cards being both Aces is 1/221.** \n",
