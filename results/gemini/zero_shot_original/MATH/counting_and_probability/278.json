How many ways can the committee be chosen? (For example, suppose that Alex is chair while Betty, Carl, and D'Angelo make up the committee. This counts as the same as Alex being chair while Carl, Betty, and D'Angelo make up the committee. It is not the same as Betty being the chair, with Alex, Carl, and D'Angelo making up the committee.

    "solution": "There are 10 ways to choose the chairman.  After choosing the chairman, we must form the rest of the committee.  For each of the other 9 candidates, we have 2 choices: either the candidate is on the committee or not.  So, the total number of ways we can form a committee with a given chairman is $2^9$.  Therefore, there are $10\\cdot 2^9 =\\boxed{5120}$ ways to form the committee.",

        "Here's how to break down the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Choosing the Chair**\n* There are 10 candidates, and any one of them can be the chair.\n* So, there are 10 ways to choose the chair.\n**2. Choosing the Members-at-Large**\n* After choosing the chair, there are 9 candidates left who could be members-at-large.\n* Each of these remaining candidates can either be on the committee or not.  \n* This means for each of the 9 remaining candidates, we have 2 choices: \"in\" or \"out\".\n**3. Total Combinations**\n* To get the total number of ways to choose the committee, we multiply the number of choices for each step:\n    * 10 (chair choices) * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 (member choices) = 10 * 2^9 \n**Therefore, there are 10 * 2^9 = 5120 ways to choose the committee.** \n",

Combining Chair and Members:**\n* To get the total number of ways to choose the entire committee, we multiply the number of ways to choose the chair by the number of ways to choose the members-at-large: 10 * 2^9 = **5120**\n**Therefore, there are 5120 ways to choose the committee.** \n",
