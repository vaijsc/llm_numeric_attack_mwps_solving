        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding the Problem**\n* We have 5 distinct keys.\n* We want to arrange them on a keychain.\n* Rotations and flips of the keychain are considered the same arrangement.\n**Solution**\n1. **Initial Thought:**  If we didn't have the rotation/flip constraint, we'd have 5! (5 factorial) ways to arrange the keys, which is 5*4*3*2*1 = 120.\n2. **Accounting for Rotation:** Imagine fixing one key as a reference point.  Rotating the keychain doesn't change the arrangement relative to that fixed key.  This means we've overcounted our arrangements by a factor of 5 (the number of keys that could have been fixed as our reference point).\n3. **Accounting for Flips:**  Flipping the keychain also doesn't change the arrangement if we've already accounted for rotations. \n**Putting it Together**\nSince we overcounted by a factor of 5 due to rotation, we need to divide our initial count by 5.  Therefore, the number of distinct arrangements of 5 keys on a keychain is:\n120 / 5 = **24** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding the Problem**\nWe need to find the number of ways to arrange 5 keys on a keychain, but rotations and flips don't count as different arrangements. Imagine the keys are arranged in a circle, and we can spin the circle or flip it over without changing the arrangement.\n**Step-by-Step Solution**\n1. **Fix a Key:**  Let's fix one key as a reference point. It doesn't matter which key we choose. \n2. **Remaining Keys:** Now we have 4 keys left to arrange.\n3. **Linear Arrangement:**  If we were arranging the keys in a straight line, there would be 4! (4 factorial) ways to do it: 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24.\n4. **Circular Arrangement:** But since it's a keychain, each arrangement has 5 rotations that look the same (rotating by 1 key position, 2 key positions, etc.).  We need to divide the linear arrangements by 5 to account for these rotations.\n**Calculation**\nNumber of arrangements = (4!)/5 = 24/5 = **4.8**\n**Answer:**\nSince we can't have a fractional number of arrangements, the answer is **4**.  There are only 4 unique ways to arrange 5 different keys on a keychain. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding the Problem**\nWe need to find the number of distinct arrangements of 5 keys on a keychain.  The catch is that rotations and flips don't count as different arrangements. This means that if we rotate the keychain or flip it over, we're still considering it the same arrangement.\n**Solution**\n1. **Fix a Key:**  Let's fix one key in a specific position on the keychain. This eliminates the issue of rotation, as we now have a reference point.\n2. **Arrange Remaining Keys:** We have 4 remaining keys to arrange. These can be arranged in 4! (4 factorial) ways, which is 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24.\n3. **Account for Flips:** Since flipping the keychain doesn't change the arrangement, we've counted each arrangement twice (once for the original orientation and once for the flipped orientation).  Therefore, we need to divide our previous result by 2.\n**Final Calculation**\nThe total number of distinct arrangements is 24 / 2 = 12.\n**Answer:** There are **12** ways to arrange 5 different keys on a keychain. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding the Problem**\nWe have 5 distinct keys and want to arrange them on a keychain.  The problem specifies that rotations and flips of the keychain are considered the same arrangement. This means we need to account for symmetry.\n**Solution**\n1. **Initial Arrangement:** If we didn't consider symmetry, there would be 5! (5 factorial) ways to arrange the keys, which is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.\n2. **Symmetry:**  Imagine a circular keychain. Each arrangement can be rotated 5 times to produce identical arrangements (imagine rotating the keys around the center of the ring). Additionally, we can flip the keychain over, giving us another identical arrangement. \n3. **Adjusting for Overcounting:**  Since each arrangement has been counted 5 times (due to rotation) and 2 times (due to flipping), we've overcounted by a factor of 10 (5 * 2).\n4. **Final Calculation:**  To get the correct number of distinct arrangements, we divide the initial number of arrangements by the overcounting factor: 120 / 10 = 12.\n**Therefore, there are 12 distinct ways to arrange 5 different keys on a keychain.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Consider a Linear Arrangement**\nIf we were to arrange the keys in a straight line, there would be 5! (5 factorial) ways to do so.  This is because we have 5 choices for the first key, 4 choices for the second, and so on.\n5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120\n**2. Account for Rotations and Flips**\nOn a keychain, we can rotate the arrangement of keys.  Imagine a keychain with 5 keys.  If we rotate it by one position, it's still the same arrangement. We can rotate it 5 times before getting back to the original position.\nSimilarly, we can flip the keychain over.  This gives us two equivalent arrangements for each linear arrangement.\n**3. Calculate the Number of Distinct Keychain Arrangements**\n* We have 120 linear arrangements.\n* Each linear arrangement corresponds to 5 rotations (including the original arrangement).\n* Each linear arrangement has 2 flips (including the original arrangement).\n* Therefore, we have 120 / (5 * 2) = 12 distinct arrangements on the keychain.\n**Answer:** There are **12** distinct ways to arrange 5 different keys on a keychain. \n"
