    "solution": "The number $ad-bc$ is even if and only if $ad$ and $bc$ are both odd or are both even.  Each of $ad$ and $bc$ is odd if both of its factors are odd, and even otherwise. Exactly half of the integers from 0 to 2007 are odd, so  each of $ad$ and $bc$ is odd with probability $(1/2)\\cdot(1/2) = 1/4$ and are even with probability $3/4$. Hence the probability that $ad-bc$ is even is \\[\n\\frac{1}{4}\\cdot \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{3}{4}\\cdot \\frac{3}{4} =\\boxed{\\frac{5}{8}}.\n\\]",

        "Here's a step-by-step solution to find the probability that  *ad - bc* is even:\n**Understanding Even and Odd Numbers**\n* **Even + Even = Even**\n* **Odd + Odd = Even**\n* **Even + Odd = Odd**\n* **Even x Even = Even**\n* **Odd x Odd = Odd**\n* **Even x Odd = Even**\n**Analyzing the Expression**\nThe expression *ad - bc* will be even if:\n* **Case 1:** *ad* and *bc* are both even.\n* **Case 2:** *ad* and *bc* are both odd.\n**Calculating Probabilities**\n* **Probability of an even number:**  There are 1004 even numbers between 0 and 2007 (inclusive). So, the probability of choosing an even number is 1004/2008 = 1/2.\n* **Probability of an odd number:**  There are 1004 odd numbers between 0 and 2007 (inclusive). So, the probability of choosing an odd number is 1004/2008 = 1/2.\n**Applying the Probabilities**\n* **Case 1 (ad and bc both even):**  The probability of *a* being even is 1/2. The probability of *d* being even is also 1/2.  Similarly for *b* and *c*. So, the probability of *ad* and *bc* both being even is (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/16.\n* **Case 2 (ad and bc both odd):** The probability of *a* being odd is 1/2. The probability of *d* being odd is also 1/2.  Similarly for *b* and *c*. So, the probability of *ad* and *bc* both being odd is (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/16.\n**Final Calculation**\nSince either Case 1 or Case 2 makes *ad - bc* even, we add the probabilities:\n1/16 + 1/16 = 1/8\n**Answer**\nThe probability that *ad - bc* is even is **1/8**. \n",

So the probability of picking an even number is 1004/2008 = 1/2.  The probability of `ad` being even is then (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 (since we're picking `a` and `d` independently).\n* **Probability of `bc` being even:**  This is also 1/4.\n* **Probability of both `ad` and `bc` being even:**  (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n* **Probability of `ad` being odd:**  The probability of picking an odd number is 1005/2008 = 1/2, so the probability of `ad` being odd is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.\n* **Probability of `bc` being odd:**  This is also 1/4.\n* **Probability of both `ad` and `bc` being odd:** (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n**Final Calculation**\nThe probability of `ad - bc` being even is the sum of the probabilities of these two mutually exclusive cases:\n1/16 + 1/16 = **1/8**\n**Therefore, the probability that `ad - bc` is even is 1/8.** \n",

Let's apply this to our products:\n* **Case 1: Both *ad* and *bc* are even.**\n    * This happens if at least one of the factors in each product is even.  \n* **Case 2: Both *ad* and *bc* are odd.**\n    * This happens if both factors in each product are odd. \n**Calculating the Probability**\n1. **Probability of *ad* being even:** \n   * The probability that *a* is even is 1004/2008 (half the numbers from 0 to 2007 are even).\n   * The probability that *d* is even is also 1004/2008.\n   * The probability that at least one of *a* or *d* is even is  1 - (probability that both are odd).\n   * The probability that both *a* and *d* are odd is (1004/2008) * (1004/2008)\n   * Therefore, the probability that *ad* is even is: 1 - (1004/2008)^2 =  3/4\n2. **Probability of *bc* being even:**  This is the same as the probability of *ad* being even, which is 3/4.\n3. **Probability of both *ad* and *bc* being even:**\n   * Since *a*, *b*, *c*, and *d* are chosen independently, the probability of both *ad* and *bc* being even is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n4. **Probability of both *ad* and *bc* being odd:**\n   * The probability of *ad* being odd is 1 - (3/4) = 1/4\n   * The probability of *bc* being odd is also 1/4\n   * The probability of both being odd is (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n5. **Overall Probability:**\n   * The probability that *ad - bc* is even is the sum of the probabilities of the two cases: (9/16) + (1/16) = 10/16 = **5/8**\n**Therefore, the probability that *ad - bc* is even is 5/8.** \n",
