    "solution": "There are only two possible occupants for the driver's seat. After the driver is chosen, there are three remaining people who can sit in the other front seat. Then the three remaining people can sit in the back seats in any arrangement. There are three choices of people to sit in the first back seat, two choices of people to sit in the next back seat, and one person to sit in the last back seat. Therefore, there are $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 = \\boxed{36}$ possible seating arrangements.",

        "Here's how we can break down the problem to find the number of possible seating arrangements:\n**1. Driver's Seat:**\n* There are 2 options for the driver's seat: Mr. Lopez or Mrs. Lopez.\n**2. Front Passenger Seat:**\n* Since the youngest child can't sit in the front passenger seat, there are 4 options for this seat (the two parents and the two older children).\n**3. Back Row:**\n* There are 3! (3 factorial) ways to arrange the three children in the back row. This is 3 * 2 * 1 = 6.\n**Putting it all together:**\n* To find the total number of seating arrangements, we multiply the number of options at each step: 2 * 4 * 6 = **48**\n**Therefore, there are 48 possible seating arrangements for the Lopez family.** \n",

Passenger Seat:**\n* Since the youngest child can't sit in the front, there are 2 choices for the passenger seat: one of the older children.\n**3. Back Seat:**\n* Now, there are 3 people remaining to fill the 3 back seats.  The order they sit in matters, so this is a permutation. We have 3 choices for the first seat, then 2 choices left for the second, and 1 choice for the last seat. \n**Calculations:**\n* **Driver's Seat:** 2 choices\n* **Passenger Seat:** 2 choices\n* **Back Seat Permutations:** 3 * 2 * 1 = 6\n**Total Arrangements:**\nTo get the total number of possible arrangements, we multiply the number of choices at each step:\n2 choices * 2 choices * 6 permutations = **24 possible seating arrangements** \n",
