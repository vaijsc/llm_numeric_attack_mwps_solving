    "solution": "There are exactly ${4 \\choose 2} = 6$ pairs of balls that we can choose. Since there are only 4 balls, and 3 different colors, there is exactly one pair of same-colored balls. So, the probability of drawing this exact pair is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this step-by-step:\n**1. Figure out the possible scenarios:**\n* **Scenario 1:** You pick two balls of the color that has two balls in the bag. \n* **Scenario 2:** You pick two balls of the color that has only one ball in the bag (this is impossible since you can't pick the same ball twice).\n**2. Calculate the probability of Scenario 1:**\n* **Step 1:** The probability of picking one ball of the color that has two balls is 2/4 (since there are two balls of that color out of four total).\n* **Step 2:** After taking out one ball, there's only one left of that color. So, the probability of picking another ball of the same color is 1/3 (since there are three balls remaining).\n* **Step 3:** To get the probability of Scenario 1, multiply the probabilities from steps 1 and 2: (2/4) * (1/3) = 1/6\n**3. Calculate the probability of Scenario 2:**\n* Since this scenario is impossible, its probability is 0.\n**4.  Combine the probabilities:**\n* Since Scenario 1 is the only possible way to get two balls of the same color, the overall probability is the same as the probability of Scenario 1, which is **1/6**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Setup**\n* There are 4 balls, with 3 different colors. This means there must be two balls of one color, and one ball each of the other two colors.\n**2. Calculate the Probability of the First Ball**\n* It doesn't matter what color the first ball is, so the probability of drawing any ball is 1 (or 100%).\n**3. Calculate the Probability of the Second Ball Matching the First**\n* After removing the first ball, there are only 3 balls left. To get a match, we need to select one of the remaining balls of the same color as the first. Since there is only one ball of that color left, the probability is 1/3.\n**4. Multiply the Probabilities**\n* To get the probability of both events happening, we multiply the individual probabilities: 1 * (1/3) = 1/3\n**Answer:** The probability of selecting two balls of the same color without replacement is **1/3**. \n",

Possible Scenarios**\nTo get two balls of the same color, there are three possibilities:\n* **Scenario 1:**  We pick the two balls of the color with two balls.\n* **Scenario 2:**  We pick two of the balls of the same color that has only one ball.
