    "solution": "After Gimli has flipped his coin 2008 times, the probability that he has more heads than Legolas is equal the probability that Legolas has more heads than him. Call this probability $p$. Then there is a $1-2p$ probability that they have the same number of heads. If Gimli already has more heads, he will have more heads after he flips again. If he has fewer heads, he cannot have more after just one more flip. If they are even, there is a $1/2$ chance he will flip another head, and therefore have more heads. In all, Gimli flips more heads than Legolas with probability $p+\\frac12(1-2p)=p+\\frac12-p=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.",

        "Here's how to break down the problem and find the solution:\n**1. Symmetry:**\n* Notice that the problem is symmetrical.  It's just as likely for Legolas to get more heads than Gimli as it is for Gimli to get more heads than Legolas. \n* The only other possibility is that they get the same number of heads.\n**2.  Focus on Equal Heads:**\n* Let's calculate the probability that they get the *same* number of heads.  This is the only case where Gimli doesn't have more heads than Legolas.\n* Since they are flipping fair coins, the probability of getting heads or tails on each flip is 1/2.\n**3.  Calculating the Probability of Equal Heads:**\n* To get the same number of heads, they must both flip a specific number of heads (let's call it 'k').  We need to consider all possible values of 'k'.\n* The probability of Legolas getting 'k' heads in 2008 flips is given by the binomial probability formula:\n    *  P(Legolas gets 'k' heads) = (2008 choose k) * (1/2)^2008 \n    *  (2008 choose k) is the binomial coefficient, which represents the number of ways to choose 'k' heads out of 2008 flips.\n* Similarly, the probability of Gimli getting 'k' heads in 2009 flips is:\n    *  P(Gimli gets 'k' heads) = (2009 choose k) * (1/2)^2009\n* To get the probability that both events happen, we multiply these probabilities:\n    *  P(Legolas gets 'k' heads AND Gimli gets 'k' heads) = [(2008 choose k) * (1/2)^2008] * [(2009 choose k) * (1/2)^2009] = [(2008 choose k) * (2009 choose k)] / 2^4017\n**4. Summing Over All 'k':**\n* We need to calculate this probability for every possible value of 'k' (from 0 to 2008, since Legolas can't have more heads than flips) and sum them up:\n    *  P(Equal Heads) = \u03a3 [(2008 choose k) * (2009 choose k)] / 2^4017  (where the sum goes from k = 0 to k = 2008)\n**5. Finding the Probability of Gimli Getting More Heads:**\n* Now that we have the probability of equal heads, we can find the probability of Gimli getting more heads using symmetry:\n    *  P(Gimli has more heads) = 1 - P(Legolas has more heads) - P(Equal heads)\n    *  Since P(Legolas has more heads) = P(Gimli has more heads) due to symmetry:\n    *  P(Gimli has more heads) = (1 - P(Equal heads)) / 2\n**6.  The Answer:**\n*  The probability of Gimli getting more heads than Legolas is approximately **0.5**.  The probability of equal heads is very small (due to the large number of flips) and so the probability of Gimli having more heads is almost exactly half. \n**Important Note:**  Calculating the exact probability of equal heads would require a powerful computer to handle the large binomial coefficients.  The key to solving this problem is understanding the symmetry and the small probability of equal heads. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Symmetry:**\n* Notice that the problem is symmetrical. We could just as easily ask for the probability that Legolas flips more heads than Gimli.  Since there are only two possibilities (Gimli more heads, or Legolas more heads), the probability of each must be equal.\n**2.  The Tie Case:**\n* We need to consider the possibility that Legolas and Gimli flip the same number of heads.  If they both flip the same number of heads, then Gimli doesn't flip more heads.\n**3. Calculating the Probability:**\n* **Let's calculate the probability of Legolas getting more heads than Gimli.**  \n    * This is the same as the probability of Legolas getting more heads than Gimli *and* the probability of them getting the same number of heads.\n    * Since the probabilities of each event are equal, we can find the probability of Gimli getting more heads by finding the probability of Legolas getting more heads and then subtracting from 1.\n**4.  The Challenge:**\n* Directly calculating the probability of Legolas getting more heads is quite complex.  We'd need to sum the probabilities of Legolas getting 1005 heads, 1006 heads, ... all the way up to 2008 heads.\n**5.  The Easier Approach:**\n* Instead, let's consider the average number of heads each person will get:\n    * Legolas: On average, he'll flip 2008 / 2 = 1004 heads.\n    * Gimli: On average, he'll flip 2009 / 2 = 1004.5 heads.\n* Since Gimli is expected to flip slightly more heads, it's more likely that he'll have more heads than Legolas.  Therefore, the probability of Gimli flipping more heads is slightly greater than 1/2.\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile we haven't calculated the exact probability, we can confidently say that the probability of Gimli flipping more heads than Legolas is *greater than 50%* due to the slight advantage Gimli has with one extra flip. \n",
        "Here's how to break down the problem:\n**1.  Symmetry**\n* The problem is symmetrical.  It's just as likely for Legolas to flip more heads than Gimli as it is for Gimli to flip more heads than Legolas.  The only other possibility is that they flip the same number of heads. \n**2.  Calculating the Probability of a Tie**\n*  To find the probability that Gimli flips more heads than Legolas, we can use the following logic:\n   *  Probability (Gimli flips more heads) + Probability (Legolas flips more heads) + Probability (Tie) = 1\n   *  Since the first two probabilities are equal, we can simplify: \n      * 2 * Probability (Gimli flips more heads) + Probability (Tie) = 1\n   * To find the probability Gimli flips more heads, we need to figure out the probability of a tie.\n**3.  Probability of a Tie**\n*  For Gimli and Legolas to tie, they need to flip the same number of heads. This means Gimli needs to flip between 1004 and 2008 heads (inclusive).  We can calculate the probability of each specific outcome and sum them up.  \n**4.  Using the Binomial Distribution**\n*  The probability of getting a certain number of heads in a given number of flips can be calculated using the binomial distribution.  \n*  For example, the probability of Gimli flipping exactly 1004 heads in 2009 flips is:\n    *  (2009 choose 1004) * (1/2)^1004 * (1/2)^1005 \n    *  Where (2009 choose 1004) represents the number of ways to choose 1004 heads out of 2009 flips.\n**5.  Summing the Probabilities**\n* We need to calculate the probability of each possible tie outcome (1004 heads, 1005 heads, ..., 2008 heads) and add them all up. This is computationally intensive.\n**6.  Approximation**\n* Since the number of flips is large, we can approximate the probability of a tie using the normal distribution. The mean number of heads for both Gimli and Legolas is 1004.5, and the standard deviation is approximately 22.4.  We can use the normal distribution to estimate the probability of a tie in a small range around the mean.\n**7.  Calculating the Final Probability**\n*  With the probability of a tie, we can finally solve for the probability of Gimli flipping more heads:\n    *  2 * Probability (Gimli flips more heads) + Probability (Tie) = 1\n    *  Probability (Gimli flips more heads) = (1 - Probability (Tie))/2\n**Important Note:** This calculation is complex and would likely require a computer to calculate accurately. The final probability will be slightly greater than 1/2, as Gimli has one extra flip, making it slightly more likely he'll have more heads.\n",
        "Here's how to break down the problem and find the probability:\n**1. Symmetry:**\n* Notice that the problem is symmetrical. If we swap \"heads\" and \"tails\" in the problem, the probability stays the same.  This means the probability of Gimli getting *more tails* than Legolas is the same as the probability of him getting more heads.\n**2.  Consider the 'Tie' Case:**\n*  The only way Gimli *doesn't* get more heads than Legolas is if he gets the same number of heads, or fewer. Let's think about the \"tie\" case first.\n**3.  Probability of a Tie:**\n* For a tie, both Legolas and Gimli need to get the same number of heads.  Let's say Legolas gets *k* heads. The probability of this is:\n    *  (1/2)^2008 (for Legolas getting *k* heads)\n    *  (1/2)^2009 (for Gimli getting *k* heads)\n* Since *k* can be any number from 0 to 2008, we need to sum the probabilities for all these cases.\n**4.  Probability of Gimli Getting Fewer Heads:**\n* If Gimli gets fewer heads than Legolas, the probability is the same as the probability of getting more tails (due to symmetry). \n* Since the total probability of all possible outcomes is 1,  the probability of Gimli getting fewer heads is simply 1 minus the probability of him getting the same or more heads.\n**5.  Putting it Together:**\nLet's denote the probability of Gimli getting *more* heads than Legolas as *P*.  \n* Probability of a tie:  \u03a3 (1/2)^2008 * (1/2)^2009 (where the sum goes from k = 0 to 2008)\n* Probability of Gimli getting fewer heads:  1 - P\n* Probability of Gimli getting the same or fewer heads:  \u03a3 (1/2)^2008 * (1/2)^2009 + (1 - P)\nSince the probability of all possible outcomes must equal 1:\n\u03a3 (1/2)^2008 * (1/2)^2009 + (1 - P) = 1\nSimplifying:\nP = \u03a3 (1/2)^2008 * (1/2)^2009 = (2009/2)^2009\n**Therefore, the probability of Gimli flipping more heads than Legolas is (2009/2)^2009.**\n**Important Note:**  This probability is extremely close to 1/2.  The reason is that the number of flips is very large, making the outcome close to a 50/50 chance. \n",
        "Here's how to break down the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Symmetry**\n*  The problem has inherent symmetry.  Since the coins are fair, there's an equal chance of getting heads or tails on each flip.  This means that the probability of Gimli getting more heads than Legolas is the same as the probability of Legolas getting more heads than Gimli.\n**2.  Tie Scenario**\n*  The only remaining possibility is that they get the same number of heads. We need to account for this scenario.\n**3.  Combining Possibilities**\n*  Since the two possibilities (Gimli more heads than Legolas, or Legolas more heads than Gimli) are equally likely, and they cover all cases except for a tie, the probability of Gimli getting more heads than Legolas is:\n   (1/2) * (1 - Probability of a tie)\n**4.  Calculating the Probability of a Tie**\n*  To get a tie, both Legolas and Gimli need to get the same number of heads. Let's consider the possible number of heads Legolas can get, and for each, calculate the probability of Gimli also getting that number of heads:\n    * **Legolas gets 0 heads:**  Gimli needs 0 heads. The probability of this is  (1/2)^2009.\n    * **Legolas gets 1 head:** Gimli needs 1 head. The probability of this is (2009 choose 1) * (1/2)^2009. \n    * **... and so on, until Legolas gets 2008 heads**\n*  We need to sum up these probabilities for all possible tie scenarios.  \n**5.  Final Calculation**\n*  The probability of Gimli getting more heads than Legolas is:\n   (1/2) * (1 - [Probability of 0 heads tie + Probability of 1 head tie + ... + Probability of 2008 heads tie])\n**The exact calculation is complex, but we can make a key observation:**\n*  Since the number of flips is large (2008 and 2009), the probability of a tie is going to be very small. This is because the distribution of heads will be quite spread out. \n**Therefore, the probability of Gimli flipping more heads than Legolas is very close to 1/2.** \n"
