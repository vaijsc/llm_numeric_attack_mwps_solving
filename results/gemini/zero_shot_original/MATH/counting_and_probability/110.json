        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n* **Identify the favorable outcomes:** The odd numbers on the spinner are 15 and 23.\n* **Identify all possible outcomes:**  There are three numbers on the spinner: 14, 15, and 23.\n* **Calculate the probability:** The probability of spinning an odd number is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes: 2/3.\n**Therefore, the probability of spinning an odd number is 2/3.** \n",
        "1. **Identify the odd numbers:**  The spinner has the numbers 15, 23, and 14.  The odd numbers are 15 and 23.\n2. **Count the total outcomes:** There are three possible outcomes (15, 23, and 14).\n3. **Calculate the probability:**  The probability of spinning an odd number is the number of favorable outcomes (spinning an odd number) divided by the total number of outcomes.  This gives us 2/3.\n**Therefore, the probability of spinning an odd number is 2/3.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n* **Identify the possible outcomes:** The spinner has three possible outcomes: 15, 23, and 14.\n* **Identify the favorable outcomes:**  We want an odd number, so the favorable outcome is 15.\n* **Calculate the probability:** Probability is calculated as (number of favorable outcomes) / (total number of possible outcomes).  In this case, the probability of spinning an odd number is 1/3.\n**Therefore, the probability of spinning an odd number is 1/3.** \n",
