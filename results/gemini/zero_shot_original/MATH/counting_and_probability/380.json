    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The arithmetic mean equals the sum of the elements divided by the number of elements in the row. In Pascal's Triangle where the first row is $n=0$, row $n$ has $n+1$ elements and the sum of the elements is $2^n$, which makes the arithmetic mean $\\frac{2^n}{n+1}$. Now we look for the value of $n$ that satisfies $51.2=\\frac{2^n}{n+1}$. If $51.2(n+1)=2^n$ and $n$ is a non-negative integer, we know that $2^n>51.2\\qquad\\Rightarrow n\\ge 6$. If $n=6$, $2^n=64$, but $51.2(7)$ is much greater than $64$ (we can estimate $51.2(7)$ with $50\\cdot7=350$). With $n=7$ and $n=8$, we also find that $51.2(n+1)$ is greater than $2^n$. When we try $n=9$, we get $51.2(10)=2^{9}=512$, which is true. The value of $n$ is $\\boxed{9}$.",

This is because each element in the row represents the number of ways to choose a certain number of objects from a set of 'n' objects (combinations).\n**Setting up the Equation**\n1. **Sum of elements:** The sum of elements in the nth row is 2<sup>n</sup>.\n2. **Number of elements:** There are (n+1) elements in the nth row.\n3. **Arithmetic Mean:** The arithmetic mean of the elements is 51.2.\nTherefore, we can set up the following equation:\n(2<sup>n</sup>) / (n + 1) = 51.2\n**Solving for n**\nThis equation is not easily solved algebraically.

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**Understanding Pascal's Triangle and its Properties**\n* **Rows and Elements:** Each row in Pascal's Triangle is numbered starting with 0. The elements in each row are called \"coefficients.\" \n* **Symmetry:** Pascal's Triangle is symmetrical. The elements on the left side mirror the elements on the right side.\n* **Sum of Elements:** The sum of the elements in the nth row of Pascal's Triangle is 2^n.\n**Solution**\n1. **Arithmetic Mean:** The arithmetic mean (average) of a set of numbers is found by summing the numbers and dividing by the total number of elements.\n2. **Applying to Pascal's Triangle:** We know that the arithmetic mean of the elements in the nth row is 51.2. This means:\n   (Sum of elements in the nth row) / (Number of elements in the nth row) = 51.2\n3. **Using Properties:**\n   * **Sum of elements:** The sum of the elements in the nth row is 2^n.\n   * **Number of elements:** The nth row has (n+1) elements.\n4. **Setting up the Equation:**\n   (2^n) / (n + 1) = 51.2\n5. **Solving for n:** Unfortunately, there's no easy algebraic way to solve this equation directly. We need to use trial and error or numerical methods.\n6. **Trial and Error:**\n    * Start by trying different values of n.  \n    * For example, if n = 8, then (2^8) / (8+1) = 256/9 = 28.44, which is too small.\n    * If n = 10, then (2^10) / (10+1) = 1024/11 = 93.09, which is too large.\n    * We can continue to test values until we find one that gets closer to 51.2.\n7. **Numerical Methods:**\n   * A more efficient method is to use a calculator or computer program to solve the equation (2^n) / (n+1) = 51.2.  This will give you a more precise answer.\n**The Answer:** \nAfter using trial and error or numerical methods, we find that the value of n is approximately **9.5**. Since n must be an integer, there is no perfect row of Pascal's Triangle where the arithmetic mean is exactly 51.2. However, we found that the value of n is close to 9.5. \n",
