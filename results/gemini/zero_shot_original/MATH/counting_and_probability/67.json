    "solution": "Given any pair of the 4 CDs, there is exactly one arrangement with only these two CDs in the correct cases, because each of the remaining two CDs must be in the case of the other one.  Therefore, there are $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ arrangements of the CDs for which exactly two of the CDs are in the correct case.  The probability that one of these 6 arrangements will be chosen from among the $4!=24$ equally likely arrangements is $\\dfrac{6}{24}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{4}}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1.  Total Possible Arrangements**\n* There are 4 CDs, and each CD can go into any of the 4 cases.\n* So, there are 4 * 4 * 4 * 4 = 256 possible arrangements.\n**2.  Arrangements with Exactly Two CDs in the Wrong Cases**\n* To have exactly two CDs in the wrong cases, the other two CDs must be in the correct cases. \n* Let's figure out how many ways we can choose the two CDs that will be in the wrong cases.  There are 4 choose 2 ways to do this, which is  4! / (2! * 2!) = 6.\n* Now, let's consider one of those chosen pairs.  The two CDs can be placed in the wrong cases in 2 ways (either CD1 in case 2 and CD2 in case 1, or vice versa).\n* The other two CDs must be in the correct cases.\n**3.  Calculate the Probability**\n* The total number of arrangements with exactly two CDs in the wrong cases is 6 * 2 = 12.\n* The probability is the number of successful arrangements divided by the total number of arrangements: 12 / 256 = **3/64**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Calculate the total number of ways to arrange the CDs**\nThere are 4 CDs and 4 cases, so there are 4! (4 factorial) = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24 ways to arrange the CDs.\n**2. Calculate the number of ways to have exactly two CDs in the wrong cases**\nThis is a bit trickier.  Here's how to think about it:\n* **Choose the two CDs that will be misplaced:** We can choose 2 CDs out of 4 in  \u2074C\u2082 ways (4 choose 2), which is 6 ways.\n* **Arrange the chosen CDs:**  The two chosen CDs must be placed in the wrong cases.  There's only one way to do this (they swap places).\n* **Arrange the remaining CDs:**  The two remaining CDs must be placed in their correct cases. There's only one way to do this.\n**3. Calculate the probability**\n* **Favorable Outcomes:** We have 6 ways to choose the misplaced CDs * 1 way to arrange them * 1 way to arrange the remaining CDs = 6 favorable outcomes.\n* **Total Outcomes:**  We have 24 total possible arrangements.\n**Probability:** (Favorable Outcomes) / (Total Outcomes) = 6/24 = **1/4**\n**Therefore, the probability that exactly two CDs are in the wrong cases is 1/4.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1.  Calculate the total possible arrangements:**\n* There are 4 CDs, and each CD has 4 possible cases it could go into. \n* The total number of ways to arrange the CDs is 4 * 4 * 4 * 4 = 256\n**2.  Calculate the number of arrangements with exactly two CDs in the wrong cases:**\n* **Choose two CDs to be misplaced:** There are 4C2 = 6 ways to choose 2 CDs out of 4.\n* **Arrange those two incorrectly:**  Each of these two CDs has 3 incorrect cases it could be placed in. So, there are 3 * 3 = 9 ways to place them.\n* **The remaining two CDs must be in the correct cases:**  There's only 1 way to place each of them correctly.\n**3.  Calculate the probability:**\n* The number of successful arrangements (exactly two wrong) is 6 * 9 * 1 * 1 = 54.\n* The probability is the number of successful arrangements divided by the total number of arrangements: 54/256 = **27/128** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1.

Calculate the arrangements with exactly two CDs in the wrong cases:**\n* This means that two CDs are in their correct cases, and the other two are swapped.\n* **Choose the two CDs that are in their correct places:** There are 4 choose 2 ways to do this, which is 4!/(2!2!) = 6 ways.\n* **The remaining two CDs must be swapped:** There's only one way to swap two CDs.\n**3. Calculate the probability:**\n* The probability of exactly two CDs being in the wrong cases is the number of favorable arrangements divided by the total number of arrangements.\n* This is (6 * 1) / 24 = 1/4\n**Therefore, the probability that exactly two of the CDs are in the wrong cases is 1/4.** \n",
