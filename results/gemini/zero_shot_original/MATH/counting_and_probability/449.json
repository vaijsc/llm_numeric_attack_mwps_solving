        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the total number of possible subcommittees:**\n* There are 13 senators in total (5 + 6 + 2).\n* We need to choose 3 of them, so we use combinations:  \u00b9\u00b3C\u2083 = (13!)/(3!10!) = 286\n**2. Find the number of subcommittees with three Republicans:**\n* We need to choose 3 Republicans out of 5:  \u2075C\u2083 = (5!)/(3!2!) = 10\n**3. Calculate the probability:**\n* Probability = (Favorable outcomes) / (Total possible outcomes)\n* Probability = 10 / 286 = **5/143**\n**Therefore, the probability that the subcommittee consists of three Republicans is 5/143.** \n",
