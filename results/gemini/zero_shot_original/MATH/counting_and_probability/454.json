    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "For every 3 different digits, there is one corresponding descending number, which is just the digits in descending order.  So the answer is the number of combinations of three different digits, which is  $\\binom{10}{3} = \\boxed{120}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1.  Choose the Hundreds Digit**\n* The hundreds digit can be any number from 1 to 9 (since it must be the largest).  This gives us 9 choices.\n**2. Choose the Tens Digit**\n* The tens digit must be smaller than the hundreds digit.  If the hundreds digit is 9, we have 8 choices for the tens digit (1-8). If the hundreds digit is 8, we have 7 choices, and so on. \n**3. Choose the Units Digit**\n* The units digit must be smaller than the tens digit.  Since we've already chosen the hundreds and tens digits, the number of choices for the units digit is one less than the tens digit.\n**4. Calculate the Total**\nTo find the total number of descending numbers, we need to consider all the possible combinations:\n* **Hundreds Digit = 9:** 8 choices for tens, 7 choices for units  -> 8 * 7 = 56\n* **Hundreds Digit = 8:** 7 choices for tens, 6 choices for units  -> 7 * 6 = 42\n* **Hundreds Digit = 7:** 6 choices for tens, 5 choices for units  -> 6 * 5 = 30\n* **Hundreds Digit = 6:** 5 choices for tens, 4 choices for units  -> 5 * 4 = 20\n* **Hundreds Digit = 5:** 4 choices for tens, 3 choices for units  -> 4 * 3 = 12\n* **Hundreds Digit = 4:** 3 choices for tens, 2 choices for units  -> 3 * 2 = 6\n* **Hundreds Digit = 3:** 2 choices for tens, 1 choice for units  -> 2 * 1 = 2\n* **Hundreds Digit = 2:** 1 choice for tens, 0 choices for units  -> 1 * 0 = 0 \n* **Hundreds Digit = 1:** 0 choices for tens, 0 choices for units  -> 0 * 0 = 0\n**Total:** 56 + 42 + 30 + 20 + 12 + 6 + 2 = **168**\n**Therefore, there are 168 three-digit descending numbers.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Choose the first digit:**\n* We have 9 choices for the first digit (1 through 9).\n**2. Choose the second digit:**\n* Once the first digit is chosen, we have one fewer option for the second digit (since it must be smaller). So we have 8 choices.\n**3. Choose the third digit:**\n* Similarly, we have 7 choices for the third digit (since it must be smaller than the second digit).\n**4. Calculate the total:**\n* To get the total number of 3-digit descending numbers, we multiply the number of choices at each step: 9 * 8 * 7 = **504**\n**Therefore, there are 504 three-digit descending numbers.** \n",
