        "Here's how we can solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Analyze the Constraints:**\n* **Even Positive Integers:**  This means our numbers  'a', 'b', and 'c' must be 2, 4, 6, 8, ... and so on.\n* **Inequality:** The condition  *a\u00b3 + b\u00b2 + c \u2264 50* limits the possible values of our variables.\n**2.  Start with the Largest Term:**\n* Since *a\u00b3* is the largest term, let's try to maximize it.  The largest even cube less than 50 is 8\u00b3 = 512.  This is too large, so the largest possible value for *a* is 6.\n**3.  Consider the Cases:**\n* **Case 1: a = 6** \n    *  We need  6\u00b3 + b\u00b2 + c \u2264 50.  This simplifies to b\u00b2 + c \u2264 -196.  Since b and c are positive, this case is impossible. \n* **Case 2: a = 4**\n    *  We need  4\u00b3 + b\u00b2 + c \u2264 50.  This simplifies to b\u00b2 + c \u2264 18.\n    * The largest possible value for *b* is 4 (since 6\u00b2 = 36 is too big).  Let's consider possible values for *b*:\n        * **b = 4:** We have 16 + c \u2264 18, so c \u2264 2. This gives us one solution: (4, 4, 2).\n        * **b = 2:** We have 4 + c \u2264 18, so c \u2264 14. This gives us several solutions: (4, 2, 2), (4, 2, 4), (4, 2, 6), (4, 2, 8), (4, 2, 10), (4, 2, 12), (4, 2, 14).\n* **Case 3: a = 2**\n    * We need 2\u00b3 + b\u00b2 + c \u2264 50. This simplifies to b\u00b2 + c \u2264 44.\n    *  The largest possible value for *b* is 6 (since 8\u00b2 = 64 is too big).  Let's consider possible values for *b*:\n        * **b = 6:** We have 36 + c \u2264 44, so c \u2264 8. This gives us solutions: (2, 6, 2), (2, 6, 4), (2, 6, 6), (2, 6, 8).\n        * **b = 4:** We have 16 + c \u2264 44, so c \u2264 28. This gives us many solutions.\n        * **b = 2:** We have 4 + c \u2264 44, so c \u2264 40. This gives us many solutions.\n**4. Count the Solutions:**\nWe need to carefully count the solutions from Cases 2 and 3. \n* **Case 2:**  We found 7 solutions.\n* **Case 3:**  We need to be more careful here. Let's count the solutions for each value of *b*:\n    * b = 6: 4 solutions\n    * b = 4: 29 solutions (from c = 2 to c = 28)\n    * b = 2: 41 solutions (from c = 2 to c = 40)\n**5. Total Solutions:**\nAdding up the solutions, we have 7 + 4 + 29 + 41 = **81** triples (a, b, c) that satisfy the given conditions. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Constraints:**\n* **Even Positive Integers:**  All three numbers (a, b, c) must be even and greater than zero.\n* **Inequality:** The sum of the cubes of 'a', the square of 'b', and 'c' must be less than or equal to 50.\n**2.  Minimize 'a' and 'b' to Maximize 'c':**\nTo find the maximum possible values for 'c', we need to minimize 'a' and 'b' as much as possible.  The smallest even positive integer is 2.  Let's try:\n*  **a = 2:**  This gives us  2\u00b3 = 8\n*  **b = 2:**  This gives us 2\u00b2 = 4 \n**3.  Calculate the Maximum Value of 'c':**\n* We have 8 + 4 = 12 used up so far.\n* This means  c \u2264 50 - 12 = 38.\n**4.  Consider the Even Values of 'c':**\nSince 'c' must be even, it can take on the values 2, 4, 6, ..., 38.\n**5.  Finding Possible Triples:**\n* For each possible value of 'c', we need to see if we can find corresponding even values of 'a' and 'b' that satisfy the inequality. \n* For example, if c = 38, we've already used up 12, leaving no room for 'a' and 'b'.  \n* We need to work our way down from c = 38 to find valid triples.\n**6.  Counting Triples:**\nWe can organize our search by considering the possible ranges for 'a' and 'b':\n* **If a = 2 and b = 2:** The maximum value of 'c' is 38 (as we saw before).\n* **If a = 2 and b = 4:** The maximum value of 'c' is 30 (since 2\u00b3 + 4\u00b2 = 24, leaving 26 for 'c').\n* **If a = 2 and b = 6:** The maximum value of 'c' is 18 (since 2\u00b3 + 6\u00b2 = 44, leaving 6 for 'c').\n* **If a = 2 and b = 8:** The maximum value of 'c' is 6 (since 2\u00b3 + 8\u00b2 = 72, which is too large).\n* **If a = 4 and b = 2:** The maximum value of 'c' is 26 (since 4\u00b3 + 2\u00b2 = 72, which is too large).\n* **If a = 4 and b = 4:** The maximum value of 'c' is 10 (since 4\u00b3 + 4\u00b2 = 80, which is too large).\n* **If a = 4 and b = 6:** The maximum value of 'c' is 2 (since 4\u00b3 + 6\u00b2 = 100, which is too large).\n* **If a \u2265 6:**  The values of a\u00b3 + b\u00b2 will be too large to satisfy the inequality.\n**7.  Counting the Triples:**\n* **a = 2 and b = 2:** c can be 2, 4, 6, ..., 38, giving us 19 triples.\n* **a = 2 and b = 4:** c can be 2, 4, 6, ..., 30, giving us 15 triples.\n* **a = 2 and b = 6:** c can be 2, 4, 6, ..., 18, giving us 9 triples.\n* **a = 4 and b = 2:** c can be 2, 4, 6, ..., 26, giving us 13 triples.\n* **a = 4 and b = 4:** c can be 2, 4, 6, ..., 10, giving us 5 triples.\nIn total, there are 19 + 15 + 9 + 13 + 5 = **61** triples. \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understanding the Constraints**\n* **Even Positive Integers:** This means  a, b, and c must be positive whole numbers divisible by 2.\n* **Inequality:**  We need to find triples that satisfy  a\u00b3 + b\u00b2 + c \u2264 50.\n**2. Finding Upper Bounds**\n* **c:** Since a, b, and c are all positive, the maximum value of c occurs when a\u00b3 + b\u00b2 = 0. This is impossible since a and b are even positive integers. Therefore, the largest possible value of c is 48.\n* **b:**  Let's consider the maximum value of b. If c = 48, then a\u00b3 + b\u00b2 \u2264 2. The only possible value for b in this case is 2.  We can generalize this: as c decreases, the maximum possible value of b decreases as well.\n* **a:** Similarly, as c and b decrease, the maximum possible value of a decreases.\n**3. Systematic Approach**\nLet's break down the problem by considering different values of c and finding the possible values of a and b:\n* **c = 48:**  We already found b = 2, and the only possible value for a is 0 (not allowed as it's not positive).

Finding Upper Bounds**\n* **Maximizing *a*:** The largest possible value of *a* occurs when *b* and *c* are as small as possible (both equal to 2). In this case,  *a*\u00b3 \u2264 50 - 2\u00b2 - 2 = 44.  The largest even cube less than 44 is 8 (2\u00b3). So, the maximum value of *a* is 2.\n* **Maximizing *b*:**  The largest possible value of *b* occurs when *a* and *c* are as small as possible (both equal to 2).  In this case, *b*\u00b2 \u2264 50 - 2\u00b3 - 2 = 42.  The largest even square less than 42 is 36 (6\u00b2).
