This is just  $\\binom{3}{2}\\cdot \\binom{25}{2} + \\binom{3}{3}\\cdot\\binom{25}{1} = 925$, since we can choose either 2 or 3 of the top students to be in this group.

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 students.**\nThis is a combination problem, as the order in which the students are selected doesn't matter.  We can use the formula:\n*  _n_C_r_ = n! / (r! * (n-r)!) \nWhere:\n*  n is the total number of students (28)\n*  r is the number of students being selected (4)\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 4 students is: 28C4 = 28! / (4! * 24!) = 20,475\n**2. Calculate the number of ways to choose a group that does NOT include at least two of the top three students.**\nThis means we can choose 4 students from the remaining 25 (28 total students - 3 top students).\n*  25C4 = 25! / (4! * 21!) = 12,650\n**3. Find the number of ways to choose a group that DOES include at least two of the top three students.**\nSubtract the number of ways to choose a group without at least two top students from the total number of ways to choose a group:\n* 20,475 - 12,650 = 7,825\n**4. Calculate the probability.**\nDivide the number of successful outcomes (groups with at least two top students) by the total number of possible outcomes:\n* Probability = 7,825 / 20,475 = **1565/4095** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Calculate the total number of possible groups**\n* There are 28 students, and the teacher chooses 4. The total number of ways to choose 4 students out of 28 is given by the combination formula:  \n  *  \u00b2\u2078C\u2084 = (28!)/(4! * 24!) = 20,475\n**2. Calculate the number of groups with *no* top three students**\n* We need to choose 4 students from the remaining 25 students (28 total - 3 top students):\n  *  \u00b2\u2075C\u2084 = (25!)/(4! * 21!) = 12,650\n**3. Calculate the number of groups with *at least* two top three students**\n*  We know the total number of possible groups (20,475) and the number of groups with *no* top three students (12,650).  The difference gives us the number of groups with *at least* two top three students:\n  * 20,475 - 12,650 = 7,825\n**4. Calculate the probability**\n* The probability of a group having at least two top three students is the number of groups with at least two top three students divided by the total number of possible groups:\n  * 7,825 / 20,475 = **1565/4095** \n**Therefore, the probability of the group of four students including at least two of the top three geography students is 1565/4095.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 students:**\n* There are 28 students, and we're choosing 4.  This is a combination, so we use the formula:  \n   *  \u00b2\u2078C\u2084 = (28!)/(4! * 24!) = 20,475\n**2. Calculate the number of ways to choose 4 students that *don't* include at least two of the top three:**\n* **Case 1:  Choose zero top students:**\n   * We need to choose 4 students from the remaining 25 (28 total - 3 top students): \n      * \u00b2\u2075C\u2084 = (25!)/(4! * 21!) = 12,650\n* **Case 2: Choose one top student:**\n   * We choose 1 from the top 3: \u00b3C\u2081 = 3\n   * We choose 3 from the remaining 25: \u00b2\u2075C\u2083 = (25!)/(3! * 22!) = 2,300\n   * Total combinations for this case: 3 * 2,300 = 6,900\n**3. Calculate the number of ways to choose 4 students that *do* include at least two of the top three:**\n* Subtract the unfavorable cases from the total: 20,475 - 12,650 - 6,900 = 925\n**4. Calculate the probability:**\n* Divide the number of favorable cases by the total number of cases: 925 / 20,475 = **185/4095** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 students:**\n* There are 28 students, and we need to choose 4, so the total number of combinations is  28C4 = (28 * 27 * 26 * 25) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 20,475.\n**2. Calculate the number of ways to choose a group that *doesn't* include at least two of the top three students:**\n* This means we can choose 0, 1, or 2 of the top three students. Let's calculate each case:\n    * **Case 1: Choosing 0 top students:** We need to choose all 4 students from the remaining 25. This is 25C4 = (25 * 24 * 23 * 22) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 12,650\n    * **Case 2: Choosing 1 top student:** We need to choose 1 top student (3C1 = 3 ways) and 3 students from the remaining 25 (25C3 = (25 * 24 * 23) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 2,300 ways).  Total combinations: 3 * 2,300 = 6,900\n    * **Case 3: Choosing 2 top students:** We need to choose 2 top students (3C2 = 3 ways) and 2 students from the remaining 25 (25C2 = (25 * 24) / (2 * 1) = 300 ways). Total combinations: 3 * 300 = 900\n**3. Calculate the number of ways to choose a group that *does* include at least two of the top three students:**\n*  Subtract the combinations from step 2 from the total number of combinations from step 1: 20,475 - 12,650 - 6,900 - 900 = 25.\n**4. Calculate the probability:**\n*  Divide the number of successful combinations (step 3) by the total number of combinations (step 1): 25 / 20,475 = **1/819**.\n**Therefore, the probability that the group of four students includes at least two of the top three geography students is 1/819.** \n",
