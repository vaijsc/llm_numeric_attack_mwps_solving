    "solution": "It's easy to count the number of three-digit numbers which are multiples of 7: the smallest multiple of 7 which is a three-digit number is $15 \\times 7 = 105$, and the largest multiple of 7 which is a three-digit number is $142 \\times 7 = 994$.  Therefore, there are $142-15+1 = 128$ three-digit numbers which are multiples of 7.  There are 900 three-digit numbers in total (from 100 to 999), so there are $900-128 = \\boxed{772}$ three-digit numbers which are not multiples of 7.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the total number of three-digit numbers:**\n* The smallest three-digit number is 100.\n* The largest three-digit number is 999.\n* Therefore, there are 999 - 100 + 1 = 900 three-digit numbers.\n**2. Find the number of multiples of 7 within the three-digit range:**\n* The smallest multiple of 7 greater than or equal to 100 is 105 (7 * 15).\n* The largest multiple of 7 less than or equal to 999 is 994 (7 * 142).\n* So, the multiples of 7 in this range are 105, 112, 119, ..., 994.  This forms an arithmetic sequence with first term 105, common difference 7, and last term 994.\n* To find the number of terms in this sequence, we can use the formula:  last term = first term + (number of terms - 1) * common difference\n* 994 = 105 + (number of terms - 1) * 7\n* Solving for the number of terms, we get: number of terms = 128\n**3. Find the number of three-digit numbers that are NOT multiples of 7:**\n* Subtract the number of multiples of 7 from the total number of three-digit numbers: 900 - 128 = 772\n**Therefore, there are 772 three-digit numbers that are not multiples of 7.** \n",

Subtract the multiples of 7 from the total three-digit numbers:**\n* 900 (total three-digit numbers) - 128 (multiples of 7) = **772**\n**Therefore, there are 772 three-digit numbers that are not multiples of 7.** \n",

Subtract the multiples of 7 from the total number of three-digit numbers:**\n* 900 (total three-digit numbers) - 127 (multiples of 7) = 773\n**Therefore, there are 773 positive three-digit numbers that are not multiples of 7.** \n",
