        "Here's how we can solve this problem:\n* **Step 1:**  Dora must start by going either up or down.  This has probability $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n* **Step 2:** If Dora went up in step 1, she must go right in step 2 to stay on the square. If she went down in step 1, she must go left in step 2.  This has probability $\\frac{1}{4}$ (since there are four directions she could choose).\n* **Step 3:**  Dora must go down if she went up in step 1, or up if she went down in step 1. This again has probability $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n* **Step 4:** Finally, she must go left if she went right in step 2, or right if she went left in step 2.  This also has probability $\\frac{1}{4}$.\nTo get the probability of all these events happening, we multiply the probabilities of each individual step:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{128}}$$ \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  The First Step:**\n* Dora has four equally likely directions to choose from.\n* To complete the square, she *must* go either right or left on her first step.  This has a probability of $\\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n**2. The Second Step:**\n*  If Dora went right on her first step, she must now go down.\n*  If Dora went left on her first step, she must now go up.\n*  In either case, she has only one correct choice out of four, so the probability of this step is $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n**3. The Third Step:**\n*  No matter what she did on the previous step, Dora now has only one correct direction to go.\n* The probability of taking the correct third step is $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n**4. The Fourth Step:**\n*  Similar to the third step, Dora only has one correct direction.\n*  The probability of taking the correct fourth step is $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n**5. The Overall Probability:**\nTo find the probability of Dora completing the square, we multiply the probabilities of each individual step:\n$\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{128}}$ \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1.  Identify the successful paths:**\nDora needs to walk around the gray square in four steps.  The only possible ways to do this are:\n* **Clockwise:**  Right, Up, Left, Down\n* **Counterclockwise:**  Left, Down, Right, Up\n**2. Calculate the probability of one successful path:**\n*  The probability of going right on the first step is 1/4.\n*  The probability of going up on the second step (given that she went right on the first) is 1/4.\n*  The probability of going left on the third step is 1/4.\n*  The probability of going down on the fourth step is 1/4.\nTherefore, the probability of one specific successful path is (1/4) * (1/4) * (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/256\n**3. Consider both successful paths:**\nSince there are two successful paths (clockwise and counterclockwise), the total probability is:\n2 * (1/256) = **1/128** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1.  Possible Paths:**\nTo walk completely around the gray square, Dora must take these steps (or a rotation of these steps):\n* **Step 1:**  Go right (towards the gray square).\n* **Step 2:**  Go down.\n* **Step 3:**  Go left.\n* **Step 4:** Go up.\n**2. Calculate the Probability of Each Step:**\n* **Step 1:**  The probability of going right is 1/4 (she has four choices).\n* **Step 2:**  Once she's on the right side of the gray square, there's only one way to go down (probability 1/1).\n* **Step 3:** At the bottom corner, there's only one way to go left (probability 1/1).\n* **Step 4:**  At the left corner, there's only one way to go up (probability 1/1).\n**3. Multiply Probabilities:**\nTo find the probability of the entire sequence, we multiply the probabilities of each step:\n(1/4) * (1/1) * (1/1) * (1/1) = **1/4**\n**Therefore, the probability that Dora will walk completely around the gray square in her first four steps is 1/4.** \n",
        "Here's how to break down the problem:\n* **Step 1:** Dora must go either right or left.  There's a 1/2 probability of this happening.\n* **Step 2:** To continue around the square, she must go in the direction opposite to her first move.  This also has a 1/2 probability.\n* **Step 3:**  She must now move in the direction that takes her closer to the square's corner (again, a 1/2 probability).\n* **Step 4:**  Finally, she must move into the square.  This is also a 1/2 probability.\nTo get the probability of all four events happening, we multiply the individual probabilities:\n(1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = **1/16** \n"
