    "solution": "The probability that two particular dice will show 1's, two particular dice will show 2's, and the other two dice will show neither of those is $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{6}\\right)^2\\left(\\dfrac{1}{6}\\right)^2\\left(\\dfrac{4}{6}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{1}{2916}$. There are $\\binom{6}{2}=15$ ways to select two out of the 6 dice to be 1's and $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ to select two dice out of the remaining four to show 2's, which means that there are a total of $15\\cdot6=90$ ways of selecting which dice will be 1's and 2's. Multiplying this by the probability that any particular one of these arrangements will be rolled gives us our final answer of $90\\cdot\\dfrac{1}{2916}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{162}}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Choose the Dice for 1s and 2s:**\n* We need to choose 2 dice out of 6 to show a '1'.  There are  \u2076C\u2082 = (6*5)/(2*1) = 15 ways to do this.\n* We then need to choose 2 more dice out of the remaining 4 to show a '2'.  There are \u2074C\u2082 = (4*3)/(2*1) = 6 ways to do this.\n**2.  Determine the Outcomes for the Remaining Dice:**\n* The remaining two dice can show any number from 3 to 6.  There are 4 possibilities for each of these dice, giving us 4 * 4 = 16 possibilities.\n**3.  Calculate the Total Number of Favorable Outcomes:**\n* To get the total number of favorable outcomes, we multiply the possibilities from each step: 15 * 6 * 16 = 1440\n**4.  Calculate the Total Number of Possible Outcomes:**\n* Each die has 6 possible outcomes.  Since we're rolling 6 dice, the total number of possible outcomes is 6\u2076 = 46656.\n**5.  Calculate the Probability:**\n* The probability of getting exactly two 1s and two 2s is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes: 1440 / 46656 = **5/162**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step by step:\n**1.  Choose the spots for the 1s and 2s:**\n* There are 6 dice, and we need to choose 2 spots for the 1s.  This can be done in  \u2076C\u2082 ways (6 choose 2), which is 6!/(2!4!) = 15 ways.\n* Similarly, there are \u2074C\u2082 = 6 ways to choose 2 spots for the 2s from the remaining 4 dice.\n**2. Determine the outcomes for the remaining dice:**\n* The remaining 2 dice must show numbers other than 1 or 2. There are 4 possible outcomes for each of these dice.\n**3. Calculate the total possible outcomes:**\n* There are 6 possible outcomes for each die, so there are 6\u2076 = 46,656 total possible outcomes.\n**4. Calculate the probability:**\n* The probability of getting exactly two 1s, two 2s, and the rest not 1 or 2 is: \n   (15 ways to choose 1s) * (6 ways to choose 2s) * (4\u00b2 ways for the remaining dice) / (6\u2076 total possible outcomes)\n   = (15 * 6 * 16) / 46656 \n   = **1440/46656 = 5/163** \n",
