        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understanding the Triangle Inequality**\nFor a triangle to exist, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side.  This is known as the Triangle Inequality. We need to apply this to our situation.\n**2. Applying the Triangle Inequality**\nWe have three possible scenarios based on the Triangle Inequality:\n* **Scenario 1:** 1 + *x* > *y* \n* **Scenario 2:** 1 + *y* > *x*\n* **Scenario 3:** *x* + *y* > 1\n**3. Visualizing the Solution**\nSince *x* and *y* are both between 0 and 3, we can visualize these inequalities on a coordinate plane:\n* **Scenario 1 (1 + *x* > *y*):**  This inequality defines a region above the line *y* = *x* + 1.\n* **Scenario 2 (1 + *y* > *x*):** This inequality defines a region above the line *x* = *y* + 1.\n* **Scenario 3 (*x* + *y* > 1):** This inequality defines a region above the line *y* = -*x* + 1.\n**4. Finding the Favorable Region**\nThe region where all three inequalities are satisfied represents the points (*x*, *y*) that allow for the formation of a triangle. This region is an equilateral triangle with vertices (1, 0), (0, 1), and (2, 2).\n**5. Calculating the Probability**\n* **Area of the Sample Space:** The sample space is the square with vertices (0, 0), (3, 0), (3, 3), and (0, 3), which has an area of 9.\n* **Area of the Favorable Region:** The equilateral triangle has a side length of \u221a2 and an area of (\u221a3 / 4) * (\u221a2)\u00b2 = \u221a3 / 2.\n**6. The Probability**\nThe probability that a triangle can be formed is the ratio of the area of the favorable region to the area of the sample space:\nProbability = (Area of Favorable Region) / (Area of Sample Space) = (\u221a3 / 2) / 9 = **\u221a3 / 18** \n",

Understand the Triangle Inequality**\nThe Triangle Inequality states that the sum of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side.  In our case, we need to satisfy these three inequalities:\n*  x + y > 1 \n*  x + 1 > y\n*  y + 1 > x\n**2. Visualize the Solution Space**\nWe can visualize the solution space by plotting these inequalities on a coordinate plane where the x-axis represents  'x' and the y-axis represents 'y'. \n* **x + y > 1:**  This inequality represents the region above the line x + y = 1.\n* **x + 1 > y:** This inequality represents the region below the line x + 1 = y.\n* **y + 1 > x:** This inequality represents the region below the line y + 1 = x.\n**3. Identify the Feasible Region**\nThe feasible region where all three inequalities hold true is a triangular region within the square defined by 0 < x < 3 and 0 < y < 3. \n**4. Calculate Areas**\n* **Area of the entire square:** 3 * 3 = 9\n* **Area of the feasible triangular region:**  You can use the formula for the area of a triangle (1/2 * base * height) or break the triangle into simpler shapes to calculate its area. The area of the feasible triangle is 7/2. \n**5. Calculate the Probability**\nThe probability of a triangle being formed is the ratio of the area of the feasible region to the area of the entire square:\nProbability = (Area of feasible triangle) / (Area of the square) = (7/2) / 9 = **7/18**\n**Therefore, the probability that a triangle with sides of length 1, x, and y exists is 7/18.** \n",

Understand the Triangle Inequality**\nThe Triangle Inequality states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side.\n**2.

Visualize the Constraints**\nWe can represent these inequalities on a coordinate plane where the x-axis represents the value of x and the y-axis represents the value of y.  \n* **y < 1 + x:**  This is a line with slope 1 and y-intercept 1.  The region we are interested in is below this line.\n* **x < 1 + y:** This is a line with slope 1 and x-intercept 1. The region we are interested in is to the left of this line.\n* **x + y > 1:** This is a line with slope -1 and y-intercept 1. The region we are interested in is above this line.\n**4. Find the Favorable Region**\nThe region that satisfies all three inequalities is a triangle. This triangle is formed by the intersection of the three lines we described above.\n**5. Calculate the Area**\n* **Area of the entire square (0, 3) x (0, 3):** 3 * 3 = 9\n* **Area of the triangle:** (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 2 * 2 = 2 \n**6.
