    "solution": "Choose any 5 consecutive seats in which to place the Democrats -- it doesn't matter which 5 consecutive seats that we choose, since we can rotate the table.  Then there are $5!$ ways to place the Democrats in their seats, and $5!$ ways to place the Republicans in their seats, for a total of $5! \\times 5! = \\boxed{14,\\!400}$ arrangements.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Treat Each Party as a Unit**\nSince all Democrats must sit together and all Republicans must sit together, we can treat each party as a single unit.  We now have 2 units to arrange around the table.\n**2. Arranging the Units**\n* There are (2-1)! = 1! = 1 way to arrange these two units in a circle. (Think of it as fixing one unit and then there's only one place for the other).\n**3. Arranging Within Each Unit**\n* **Democrats:** The 5 Democrats can be arranged within their unit in 5! = 120 ways.\n* **Republicans:** The 5 Republicans can be arranged within their unit in 5! = 120 ways.\n**4. Total Distinguishable Arrangements**\nTo get the total number of distinguishable arrangements, multiply the possibilities from each step:\n1 * 120 * 120 = **14,400**\n**Therefore, there are 14,400 distinguishable ways to seat the committee members around the circular table with all Democrats sitting together and all Republicans sitting together.** \n",

Treat Each Party as a Unit:**\n* Since all Democrats must sit together and all Republicans must sit together, consider each party as a single unit. This means we have 2 units to arrange around the table.\n**2. Arrange the Units:**\n* There are (2-1)! = 1! = 1 way to arrange these two units around the circular table.  Remember, with circular arrangements, we fix one position to avoid overcounting rotations as different arrangements.\n**3. Arrange Democrats:**\n* Within the Democratic unit, there are 5! = 120 ways to arrange the 5 Democrats.\n**4. Arrange Republicans:**\n* Similarly, within the Republican unit, there are 5! = 120 ways to arrange the 5 Republicans.\n**5. Total Arrangements:**\n* To get the total number of distinguishable arrangements, multiply the possibilities from each step: 1 * 120 * 120 = **14,400**\n**Therefore, there are 14,400 distinguishable ways to seat the senators around the table with all members of each party sitting together.** \n",
