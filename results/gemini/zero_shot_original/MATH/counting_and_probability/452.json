    "solution": "The probability that the second number is more than $\\frac14$ unit greater than the first number decreases linearly from $\\frac34$ to $0$ as the first number increases linearly from $0$ to $\\frac34$. The average of this probability is $\\frac12 \\cdot \\frac34= \\frac38$. Since there is a $\\frac34$ chance of choosing a number from $0$ to $\\frac34$, the probability is $\\frac34 \\cdot \\frac38 = \\boxed{\\frac{9}{32}}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Visualize the Problem**\nImagine a square with vertices at (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), and (0,1).  Each point inside this square represents a possible pair of numbers (first number, second number).\n**2.  Identify the Favorable Region**\nWe want the second number to exceed the first by more than 1/4.  This means the second number must be at least 1/4 greater than the first.  We can represent this with the inequality:\n*  *y* > *x* + 1/4 \nGraphing this inequality, we get a line with slope 1 and y-intercept 1/4, shading the region above the line.\n**3. Calculate Areas**\n* The area of the entire square is 1 * 1 = 1.\n* The area of the triangle below the line *y* = *x* + 1/4  can be found by: \n    * Base: 3/4 (the difference between 1 and 1/4)\n    * Height: 3/4 (the same as the base, since the triangle is isosceles)\n    * Area: (1/2) * (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/32\n**4.  Find the Probability**\nThe probability of the second number exceeding the first by more than 1/4 is the ratio of the favorable area to the total area:\n* Probability = (Area of favorable region) / (Area of entire square)\n* Probability = (1 - 9/32) / 1\n* Probability = **23/32** \n",

Identify the favorable region**\nWe want the second number to exceed the first by more than 1/4.  This means we want the difference between the y-coordinate and the x-coordinate to be greater than 1/4.  Graphically, this corresponds to the region below the line *y* = *x* + 1/4 and above the line *y* = *x* - 1/4.\n**3. Calculate the area of the favorable region**\n* The area of the entire square is 1.\n* The area of the two triangles outside the favorable region is each (1/2)(1/4)(1/4) = 1/32.\n* The area of the favorable region is 1 - 2(1/32) = 15/16.\n**4. Determine the probability**\nThe probability that the second number exceeds the first by more than 1/4 is the ratio of the area of the favorable region to the area of the entire square:  **(15/16) / 1 = ** **15/16**. \n**Therefore, the probability is 15/16.** \n",
