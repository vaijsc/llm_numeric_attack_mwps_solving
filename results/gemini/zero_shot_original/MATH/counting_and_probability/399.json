    "problem": "An integer $x$, with $10 \\leq x \\leq 99$, is to be chosen.  If all choices are equally likely, what is the probability that at least one digit of $x$ is a 7?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are 90 possible choices for $x$.  Ten of these have a tens digit of 7, and nine have a units digit of 7.  Because 77 has been counted twice, there are $10 + 9 - 1 = 18$ choices of $x$ for which at least one digit is a 7.  Therefore the probability is $\\frac{18}{90} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{5}}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the total possible choices:**\n* There are 90 integers between 10 and 99 (inclusive), since 99 - 10 + 1 = 90.\n**2. Find the number of choices without a 7:**\n* **Tens digit:**  We have 8 choices for the tens digit (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9).\n* **Units digit:**  We also have 8 choices for the units digit (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9).\n* This gives us 8 * 8 = 64 numbers without a 7.\n**3. Find the number of choices with at least one 7:**\n* Subtract the number of choices without a 7 from the total number of choices: 90 - 64 = 26.\n**4. Calculate the probability:**\n* Probability = (Favorable outcomes) / (Total possible outcomes) \n* Probability = 26 / 90 = **13/45**\n**Therefore, the probability that at least one digit of *x* is a 7 is 13/45.** \n",
