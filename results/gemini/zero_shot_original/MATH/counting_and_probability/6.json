    "problem": "The inhabitants of the island of Jumble use the standard Roman alphabet (26 letters, A through Z).  Each word in their language is 3 letters, and for some reason, they insist that all words contain the letter A at least once.  How many 3-letter words are possible?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are $26^3$ possible words that can be formed. Of those words, $25^3$ have no A. Thus, our answer is $26^3 - 25^3 = \\boxed{1951}$.",

        "Here's how to break down the problem to find the solution:\n**1. Total possible 3-letter combinations:**\n* Each of the three positions in the word can be any of the 26 letters.\n* This gives us 26 * 26 * 26 = 17576 possible combinations.\n**2. Combinations without the letter A:**\n* If we exclude \"A\", we have 25 letters remaining for each position.\n* This gives us 25 * 25 * 25 = 15625 combinations without \"A\".\n**3.  Combinations with at least one \"A\":**\n* To find the number of words with at least one \"A\", we subtract the combinations without \"A\" from the total combinations: 17576 - 15625 = 1951\n**Therefore, there are 1951 possible 3-letter words on the island of Jumble.** \n",
        "Here's how to break down the problem and find the solution:\n**1. Total Possible Combinations (Without Restrictions):**\n* For each of the 3 positions in the word, we have 26 choices (A-Z).\n* So, the total number of possible 3-letter words is 26 * 26 * 26 = 17576\n**2. Combinations Without the Letter A:**\n* For each position, we have 25 choices (excluding A).\n* That's 25 * 25 * 25 = 15625 combinations without the letter A.\n**3. Combinations with at Least One A:**\n* To find the number of combinations *with* at least one A, we subtract the combinations without A from the total combinations.\n* 17576 - 15625 = 1951\n**Therefore, there are 1951 possible 3-letter words in Jumble that contain at least one A.** \n",
