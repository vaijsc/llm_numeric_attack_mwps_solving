    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "No matter what the result of the first roll is, there are 6 equally likely possibilities for the second roll, only one of which is the same as the first roll.  Therefore, the probability that the dice show the same number is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n* **Possible Outcomes:**  When rolling two dice, there are 6 possible outcomes for the first die and 6 possible outcomes for the second die. This gives us a total of 6 * 6 = 36 possible combinations.\n* **Favorable Outcomes:** We want to find the combinations where both dice show the same number. These are: (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5), and (6,6).  That's 6 favorable outcomes.\n* **Probability:** The probability of an event is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\nTherefore, the probability of rolling the same number on both dice is 6/36, which simplifies to **1/6**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1.  Possible Outcomes:**\n* Each die has 6 possible outcomes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).\n* With two dice, there are 6 * 6 = 36 possible combinations.\n**2.  Favorable Outcomes:**\n* To get the same number on both dice, we have these possibilities: (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5), (6,6) \n* There are 6 favorable outcomes.\n**3.  Probability:**\n* Probability is calculated as: (Favorable Outcomes) / (Total Possible Outcomes)\n* Therefore, the probability of rolling the same number on both dice is 6/36.\n**4.  Simplify:**\n* The fraction 6/36 can be simplified to **1/6**. \n**Answer:** The probability of rolling the same number on both dice is **1/6**. \n",
