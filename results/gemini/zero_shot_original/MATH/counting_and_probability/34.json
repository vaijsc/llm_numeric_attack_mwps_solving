    "solution": "We first count the even terms of the sequence. Subtract $2$ from the list to get $4,$ $8,$ $12,$ $\\ldots,$ $92,$ $96,$ and then divide by $4$ to get $1,$ $2,$ $3,$ $\\ldots,$ $23,$ $24.$ So this list has ${24}$ numbers.\n\nWe then count the odd terms of the sequence. Subtract $3$ from the list to get $4,$ $8,$ $12,$ $\\ldots,$ $92,$ then divide by $4$ to get $1,$ $2,$ $3,$ $\\ldots,$ $23.$ So this list has ${23}$ numbers.\n\nNow we sum up the above two numbers, which yield a total $24+23=\\boxed{47}$ numbers.",

        "Here's how to figure out how many numbers are in the list:\n**1. Identify the Pattern:**\n* Notice that the list consists of two alternating sequences:\n    * 6, 10, 14, ... , 94, 98 (adding 4 each time)\n    * 7, 11, 15, ... , 95 (adding 4 each time)\n**2. Count the Numbers in Each Sequence:**\n* **Sequence 1:** 6, 10, 14, ... , 94, 98\n    * To find how many numbers are in this sequence, we can think of it as a series: 6 + (4 * 1) + (4 * 2) + ... + (4 * 22) = 98\n    *  There are 23 terms in this sequence.\n* **Sequence 2:** 7, 11, 15, ... , 95\n    *  This sequence also has 23 terms.\n**3. Total Numbers:**\n* Since there are 23 numbers in each sequence, the total number of numbers in the list is 23 + 23 = **46**. \n",
        "Here's how to figure out how many numbers are in the list:\n**1. Identify the Pattern:**\n* The list starts with 6 and increases by 3 each time (6 + 3 = 9, 9 + 3 = 12, etc.). \n**2. Find the Number of Groups of 3:**\n* The list goes from 6 to 98.  \n* Divide the difference (98 - 6 = 92) by the step size (3): 92 / 3 = 30 with a remainder.\n**3. Interpret the Remainder:**\n* The remainder of 2 means there are 30 complete groups of 3, plus 2 additional numbers (6 and 98).\n**4. Calculate the Total:**\n* 30 complete groups + 2 additional numbers = **32 numbers** in the list. \n",
        "Here's how to figure out the number of numbers in the list:\n**1. Identify the Pattern:**\n* Notice that the list consists of numbers that are increasing by 3 (6, 7, 10, 11, etc.) \n**2. Determine the Number of Groups:**\n* The list starts at 6 and ends at 98. \n* To find the number of groups of three, subtract the starting number from the ending number and divide by 3, then add 1: \n   (98 - 6) / 3 + 1 = 31\n**Therefore, there are 31 numbers in the list.** \n",

Find the Number of Groups of 3:**\n*  To get to 98, we need to add groups of 3 to 6. \n*  98 - 6 = 92\n*  92 / 3 = 30 remainder 2.  This means there are 30 complete groups of 3.\n**3. Account for the Remainder:**\n* The remainder of 2 means we have two extra numbers beyond the complete groups of 3.  These are the numbers 95 and 98.\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Numbers:**\n* 30 complete groups of 3 contain 30 * 3 = 90 numbers\n*  Add the two extra numbers: 90 + 2 = 92\n**Therefore, there are 92 numbers in the list.** \n",

Find the Number of Groups of 3:**\n* The list ends at 98. To find how many groups of 3 are in the list, divide 98 by 3:  98 / 3 = 32 with a remainder of 2.\n**3.
