    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are $8!$ ways to arrange 8 allocations to the pens if they are not identical, but we must divide by $4!$ for the four dog pen allocations and divide by $3!$ for the three cat pen allocations.  So the answer is $\\dfrac{8!}{4! \\times 3!} = \\boxed{280}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Choosing the pens for dogs:**\n* The pound has 8 pens to choose from for the dogs.\n* They need to choose 4 pens.\n* The order they choose the pens doesn't matter, so we use combinations.\n* The number of ways to choose 4 pens out of 8 is  \u2078C\u2084 = (8!)/(4!4!) = 70.\n**2. Choosing the pens for cats:**\n* Now there are 4 pens left.\n* They need to choose 3 pens for the cats.\n* The number of ways to choose 3 pens out of 4 is \u2074C\u2083 = (4!)/(3!1!) = 4.\n**3. Choosing the pen for the rooster:**\n* There's only 1 pen left, so there's only 1 way to choose it for the rooster.\n**4. Total Combinations:**\n* To get the total number of ways to allocate the pens, we multiply the number of possibilities for each step: 70 * 4 * 1 = **280**\n**Therefore, there are 280 ways the pound can allocate the pens.** \n",

Choosing Pens for Dogs:**\n* The pound has 8 pens and needs to choose 4 for dogs.  \n* The order they choose doesn't matter (it's the same if they pick pen 1, then 3, then 5, then 8, or pen 8, then 5, then 3, then 1).\n* This is a combination problem.
