    "solution": "We can choose two numbers in $\\binom{99}{2}=4851$ ways. Two numbers will have a product which is a multiple of 3 if at least one of them is a multiple of 3. We can more easily count the number of ways for the product to not be a multiple of 3: this happens when neither of the numbers is a multiple of 3. There are $\\frac{99}{3}=33$ multiples of 3 less than 100, and $99-33=66$ numbers which aren't multiples of 3. The number of ways to choose two of these numbers is $\\binom{66}{2}=2145$, so the number of way to choose two numbers where at least one is a multiple of 3 is $4851-2145=2706$. The final probability is $\\frac{2706}{4851}=\\boxed{\\frac{82}{147}}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step by step:\n**1. Understand Multiples of 3**\n* A number is a multiple of 3 if it's divisible by 3.  \n* To be divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3.\n**2. Analyze the Possibilities**\n* **Case 1: Both numbers are multiples of 3.**  To find the number of multiples of 3 between 1 and 100, divide 100 by 3, which gives us 33 (with a remainder). This means there are 33 multiples of 3 less than 100.\n* **Case 2: One number is a multiple of 3, and the other is not.**  There are 33 multiples of 3, and 67 numbers that are not multiples of 3.\n**3. Calculate Probabilities**\n* **Probability of Case 1:** \n    * The probability of choosing one multiple of 3 is 33/100.\n    * The probability of choosing another multiple of 3 (after already choosing one) is 32/99 (since there's one less multiple of 3 left).\n    * The probability of Case 1 is (33/100) * (32/99) = 8/75 \n* **Probability of Case 2:** \n    * The probability of choosing a multiple of 3 then a non-multiple is (33/100) * (67/99) = 221/300\n    * The probability of choosing a non-multiple of 3 then a multiple of 3 is (67/100) * (33/99) = 221/300\n    * The total probability of Case 2 is (221/300) + (221/300) = 442/300\n**4. Total Probability**\n* The probability that the product is a multiple of 3 is the sum of the probabilities of Case 1 and Case 2: (8/75) + (442/300) = **67/75**\n**Therefore, the probability that the product of two randomly chosen positive integers less than 100 is a multiple of 3 is 67/75.** \n",
