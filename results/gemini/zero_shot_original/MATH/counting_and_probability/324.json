    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The product $ab$ is prime only when either $a$ or $b$ is one. Since $b$ cannot equal 1, $a$ must equal 1, and this occurs with probability $\\frac14$. Furthermore, $b$ must be prime, so $b$ must equal 5 or 7, and this occurs with probability $\\frac25$. Therefore, the probability that $ab$ is prime is $\\frac14\\cdot \\frac25 = \\boxed{\\frac1{10}}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand Prime Numbers:**\n* A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 that has only two divisors: 1 and itself.  \n**2. Analyze the Possibilities:**\n* For the product *ab* to be prime, one of the numbers (*a* or *b*) must be 1, and the other must be a prime number.\n**3. Identify the Prime Numbers:**\n* In the set {5, 6, 7, 8, 9}, the prime numbers are 5 and 7.\n**4. Count Favorable Outcomes:**\n* There are two ways to get a prime product:\n    * *a* = 1 and *b* = 5\n    * *a* = 1 and *b* = 7\n**5. Calculate Total Outcomes:**\n* There are 4 choices for *a* and 5 choices for *b*, giving us a total of 4 * 5 = 20 possible outcomes.\n**6. Calculate the Probability:**\n* Probability = (Favorable Outcomes) / (Total Outcomes) = 2 / 20 = 1/10\n**Therefore, the probability that the product *ab* is a prime number is 1/10.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand Prime Numbers**\n* A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 that has only two divisors: 1 and itself. \n* The first few prime numbers are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13...\n**2. Consider the Possibilities for 'a'**\n* If 'a' is 1, then the product 'ab' will always be equal to 'b', and it's impossible for 'ab' to be prime.\n* If 'a' is 2, then 'ab' will be prime if 'b' is prime (since 2 times a prime number will result in another prime number).\n* If 'a' is 3 or 4, then 'ab' will never be prime because the product will be divisible by 3 or 4 (in addition to 1 and itself).\n**3. Count the Favorable Outcomes**\n* We need to find the prime numbers in the set {5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. \n* The prime numbers in this set are 5 and 7.\n* So, there are 2 favorable outcomes where 'ab' is prime.\n**4. Calculate the Total Outcomes**\n* There are 4 possible values for 'a' and 5 possible values for 'b'.\n* Therefore, there are 4 * 5 = 20 total possible combinations of 'a' and 'b'.\n**5. Calculate the Probability**\n* Probability = (Favorable Outcomes) / (Total Outcomes)\n* Probability = 2 / 20 = 1/10\n**Answer:** The probability that the product 'ab' is a prime number is **1/10**. \n",

Analyze the Possible Products**\n* To get a prime product, one of the numbers ($a$ or $b$) must be 1, and the other must be a prime number.\n**3. Count Favorable Outcomes**\n* **If  a = 1:**  There are 4 possible values of b (5, 7, and the two primes 2 and 3) that will result in a prime product.\n* **If b = 1:** This is not possible since 'b' cannot be 1.\n**4. Calculate the Probability**\n* There are 4 x 5 = 20 possible combinations for choosing 'a' and 'b'. \n* There are 4 favorable outcomes.\n* Probability = (Favorable Outcomes) / (Total Possible Outcomes) = 4 / 20 = 1/5.\n**Therefore, the probability that the product ab is a prime number is 1/5.** \n",
