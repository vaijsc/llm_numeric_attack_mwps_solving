        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the number of freshmen girls and boys:**\n* **Freshmen Girls:** 12 out of 15 girls are freshmen.\n* **Freshmen Boys:** 11 out of 15 boys are freshmen.\n**2. Find the number of non-freshmen girls and boys:**\n* **Non-Freshmen Girls:** 15 girls - 12 freshmen girls = 3 non-freshmen girls\n* **Non-Freshmen Boys:** 15 boys - 11 freshmen boys = 4 non-freshmen boys\n**3. Calculate the probability of selecting two freshmen girls and three freshmen boys:**\n* **Probability of selecting two freshmen girls:** (12/15) * (11/14) * (10/13) = 0.433 (approximately)\n* **Probability of selecting three freshmen boys:** (11/15) * (10/14) * (9/13) = 0.346 (approximately)\n* **Probability of selecting a specific group of five students with this composition:** 0.433 * 0.346 = 0.150 (approximately)\n**4. Calculate the number of ways to choose this group of five students:**\n* **Ways to choose two freshmen girls out of 12:**  \u00b9\u00b2C\u2082 = 66\n* **Ways to choose three freshmen boys out of 11:** \u00b9\u00b9C\u2083 = 165\n**5. Calculate the total number of ways to choose five students out of 30:** \n* **Total ways to choose five students:** \u00b3\u2070C\u2085 = 142,506\n**6. Calculate the final probability:**\n* **Probability of selecting two freshmen girls and three freshmen boys:** (0.150 * 66 * 165) / 142,506 = **0.012** (approximately)\n**Therefore, the probability of randomly selecting a group of five students with two freshmen girls and three freshmen boys is approximately 0.012.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the number of freshmen and non-freshmen in each gender group:**\n* **Girls:**\n    * Freshmen: 12\n    * Non-freshmen: 15 - 12 = 3\n* **Boys:**\n    * Freshmen: 11\n    * Non-freshmen: 15 - 11 = 4\n**2. Calculate the probabilities for each selection:**\n* **Probability of choosing a freshmen girl:** 12/30 \n* **Probability of choosing a non-freshmen girl:** 3/30\n* **Probability of choosing a freshmen boy:** 11/30\n* **Probability of choosing a non-freshmen boy:** 4/30\n**3. Set up the probability calculation:**\nWe need to find the probability of this specific scenario:\n* **Two freshmen girls AND Three freshmen boys**\nThis can be expressed as:\n(Probability of choosing a freshmen girl) * (Probability of choosing another freshmen girl) * (Probability of choosing a freshmen boy) * (Probability of choosing another freshmen boy) * (Probability of choosing another freshmen boy) \n*  We also need to consider the different ways we can choose these five students.  There are \u2075C\u2082 ways to choose 2 freshmen girls out of 12, and \u2075C\u2083 ways to choose 3 freshmen boys out of 11.\n**4. Calculate the probability:**\nThe probability of selecting this specific group is:\n[(\u00b9\u00b2C\u2082 * \u00b9\u00b9C\u2083) / \u00b3\u2070C\u2085] * [(12/30) * (12/29) * (11/28) * (11/27) * (11/26)]\n**5. Simplify and calculate:**\nThis simplifies to:\n[(66 * 165) / 142,506] * [(1728 * 1331) / (24389000)]\n**6. Approximate the decimal:**\nThe final probability is approximately **0.016**. \n",
