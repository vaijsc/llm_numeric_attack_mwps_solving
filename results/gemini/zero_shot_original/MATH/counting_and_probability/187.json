        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Understand the situation**\n* We have 7 islands.\n* Each island has a 1/5 chance of having treasure (and therefore a 4/5 chance of not having treasure).\n* We want to find the probability of exactly 4 islands having treasure.\n**2.  Identify the pattern**\nThis is a binomial probability problem. We can use the following formula:\nP(exactly *k* successes in *n* trials) = (n choose k) * p^k * q^(n-k)\nWhere:\n* n = number of trials (islands in this case) = 7\n* k = number of successes (islands with treasure) = 4\n* p = probability of success (finding treasure on an island) = 1/5\n* q = probability of failure (not finding treasure) = 4/5\n* (n choose k) = the binomial coefficient, calculated as n! / (k! * (n-k)!), which represents the number of ways to choose *k* items out of *n*.\n**3.  Calculate the probability**\nLet's plug in the values:\n* (7 choose 4) = 7! / (4! * 3!) = 35\n* p^k = (1/5)^4 = 1/625\n* q^(n-k) = (4/5)^3 = 64/125\nNow, multiply these together:\nP(exactly 4 islands with treasure) = 35 * (1/625) * (64/125) = **112/15625** \n**Therefore, the probability of exactly 4 out of the 7 islands having treasure is approximately 0.00717 (or about 0.717%).** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step by step:\n**1. Find the probability of one specific outcome:**\n* Let's say the first four islands have treasure, and the last three don't.  The probability of this specific outcome is:\n   * (1/5) * (1/5) * (1/5) * (1/5) * (4/5) * (4/5) * (4/5) = (1/5)\u2074 * (4/5)\u00b3\n**2. Count the number of possible outcomes:**\n* There are 7 islands, and we need to choose 4 of them to have treasure.  The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula: \u2077C\u2084 = 7! / (4! * 3!) = 35 \n**3. Calculate the total probability:**\n*  Since each of the 35 possible outcomes has the same probability, the total probability of exactly 4 islands having treasure is:\n   * 35 * (1/5)\u2074 * (4/5)\u00b3 \u2248 **0.16384**\n**Therefore, the probability that exactly 4 out of the 7 islands have treasure is approximately 0.16384, or about 16.38%.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Understanding the Scenario**\n* We have 7 islands.\n* Each island has a 1/5 chance of having treasure (and a 4/5 chance of not having treasure).\n* We want to find the probability of exactly 4 islands having treasure.\n**2.  Using the Binomial Probability Formula**\nThis problem fits the pattern of a binomial probability situation. Here's the formula:\nP(exactly *k* successes in *n* trials) = (n choose k) * p^k * q^(n-k)\nWhere:\n* **n** is the number of trials (islands in this case) = 7\n* **k** is the number of successes (islands with treasure) = 4\n* **p** is the probability of success on a single trial (finding treasure) = 1/5\n* **q** is the probability of failure on a single trial (not finding treasure) = 4/5\n* **(n choose k)** is the binomial coefficient, calculated as n! / (k! * (n-k)!).

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Probability of Treasure on a Single Island**\n* The probability of finding treasure on a single island is 1/5.\n* The probability of NOT finding treasure on a single island is 4/5.\n**2.  Probability of 4 Islands with Treasure and 3 Without**\n* We need 4 islands with treasure and 3 without.  We can represent this as: TTTTNNN (where T = Treasure and N = No Treasure).\n* The probability of this specific sequence is: (1/5) * (1/5) * (1/5) * (1/5) * (4/5) * (4/5) * (4/5) = (4^3) / (5^7)\n**3.  Possible Combinations**\n* The sequence above is just one way to get 4 treasure islands.  We need to account for all the possible arrangements of 4 T's and 3 N's.\n* The number of ways to arrange 4 T's and 3 N's is given by the combination formula: 7! / (4! * 3!) = 35 \n**4.  Total Probability**\n* To get the final probability, we multiply the probability of one specific sequence by the number of possible combinations: \n   (4^3) / (5^7) * 35 = **112 / 78125 \u2248 0.00143**\n**Therefore, the probability that exactly 4 of the 7 islands have treasure is approximately 0.143%.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Problem**\nWe have a series of independent events (each island having treasure or not).  We want to find the probability of a specific combination of these events (exactly 4 islands with treasure).\n**2. Identify the Tools**\nWe'll use the following:\n* **Binomial Probability Formula:** This formula helps us calculate the probability of exactly *k* successes in *n* independent trials, where each trial has a probability of success *p*. The formula is:\n   P(exactly k successes) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n   where (n choose k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!) is the binomial coefficient, representing the number of ways to choose *k* items from a set of *n*.\n**3.
