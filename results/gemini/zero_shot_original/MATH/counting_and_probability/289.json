        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Consider the possible cases:**\n* **Case 1: Both *a* and *b* are even.**  In this case, *ab* is even, and adding *c* (even or odd) will still result in an even number.\n* **Case 2: Both *a* and *b* are odd.** In this case, *ab* is odd. To make *ab + c* even, *c* must be odd.\n* **Case 3: One of *a* and *b* is even and the other is odd.** In this case, *ab* is even. Adding *c* (even or odd) will still result in an even number.\n**2. Calculate the probabilities:**\n* **Case 1:** Probability of *a* being even is 2/5. Probability of *b* being even is 2/5. So the probability of both being even is (2/5) * (2/5) = 4/25.\n* **Case 2:** Probability of *a* being odd is 3/5. Probability of *b* being odd is 3/5. Probability of *c* being odd is 3/5. So the probability of this case is (3/5) * (3/5) * (3/5) = 27/125.\n* **Case 3:**  The probability of one being even and the other odd is the same as the probability of one being odd and the other even. Since these cases are mutually exclusive, we can add their probabilities.  The probability of this case is 2 * (2/5) * (3/5) = 12/25.\n**3. Add the probabilities of the successful cases:**\nThe probability that *ab + c* is even is the sum of the probabilities of the three cases:\n(4/25) + (27/125) + (12/25) = **67/125**\n**Therefore, the probability that *ab + c* is even is 67/125.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Problem**\nWe need to find the probability that the sum of the product of two numbers and a third number is even.  This means we need to figure out how many combinations of *a*, *b*, and *c* result in an even number, and divide that by the total number of possible combinations.\n**2. Analyze Even and Odd Numbers**\nRemember the following rules for even and odd numbers:\n* **Even + Even = Even**\n* **Odd + Odd = Even**\n* **Even + Odd = Odd**\n* **Even x Even = Even**\n* **Odd x Odd = Odd**\n* **Even x Odd = Even**\n**3. Determine Winning Combinations**\nTo get an even sum (ab + c), we need one of the following:\n* **Case 1:  *ab* is even, and *c* is even** \n    * To make *ab* even, we need at least one of *a* or *b* to be even.\n* **Case 2:  *ab* is odd, and *c* is odd**\n    * To make *ab* odd, both *a* and *b* must be odd.\n**4. Calculate Probabilities**\n* **Probability of *ab* being even:**\n    * There are 3 even numbers (2, 4, 6) and 2 odd numbers (1, 3, 5) in the set.\n    * The probability of *a* being even is 3/5.\n    * The probability of *b* being even is 3/5.\n    * The probability of *a* being odd is 2/5.\n    * The probability of *b* being odd is 2/5.\n    * So, the probability of *ab* being even is:\n        * (3/5) * (3/5) + (2/5) * (2/5) = 13/25 \n* **Probability of *c* being even:**  3/5 (since there are 3 even numbers)\n* **Probability of *c* being odd:** 2/5\n**5. Calculate the Overall Probability**\n* **Probability of Case 1:** (13/25) * (3/5) = 39/125\n* **Probability of Case 2:** (2/5) * (2/5) * (2/5) = 8/125\n* **Total Probability:** (39/125) + (8/125) = **47/125**\n**Therefore, the probability that ab + c is even is 47/125.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step by step:\n**1. Consider the Possibilities for Evenness:**\n* **Case 1:  ab is even and c is even.** For *ab* to be even, at least one of *a* or *b* must be even.  Since we're choosing with replacement, there are many ways this can happen.\n* **Case 2: ab is odd and c is odd.**  For *ab* to be odd, both *a* and *b* must be odd.\n**2.
