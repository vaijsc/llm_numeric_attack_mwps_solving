    "solution": "There are two paths from A to B: A to K to B, and A to J to B.  The probability that a log will go from A to K to B is the probability that it will choose the middle flume initially times the probability that it will choose the flume to the right given that it chose the middle flume initially: $\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)=\\frac{1}{6}$.  Similarly, the probability that the log will go from A to J to B is $\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)=\\frac{1}{9}$.

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n* **From A to J or K:**  A log in pond A has two possible paths:  it can go to pond J or pond K. Since the paths are equally likely, the probability of going to either pond is 1/2.\n* **From J to B:** A log in pond J has only one exit path, which leads to pond B. So the probability of going from J to B is 1.\n* **From K to B:** A log in pond K has two possible paths: one leading to pond B and one leading to pond C. So the probability of going from K to B is 1/2.\nNow we can calculate the probability of a log ending up in pond B:\n1. **A to J to B:**  (Probability of A to J) * (Probability of J to B) = (1/2) * (1) = 1/2.\n2. **A to K to B:** (Probability of A to K) * (Probability of K to B) = (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.\nFinally, we add the probabilities of these two mutually exclusive paths:\n1/2 + 1/4 = **3/4**\nTherefore, the probability that a log in pond A will end up in pond B is **3/4**. \n",
