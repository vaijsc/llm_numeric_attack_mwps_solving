        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1.  Understanding the Symmetry**\n* **Rotations:** The hexagon has 6-fold rotational symmetry.  This means that if you rotate the arrangement by 60 degrees, 120 degrees, 180 degrees, 240 degrees, or 300 degrees, it will look the same. \n* **Reflections:** The hexagon also has multiple lines of symmetry (including the lines connecting opposite vertices and the lines connecting midpoints of opposite sides).\n**2.  Choosing a Reference Point**\nTo avoid overcounting arrangements due to symmetry, we'll choose a reference point.  Let's say the bead in the top position (the center of the hexagon) is our reference point.  \n**3.  Casework**\nNow, we need to consider cases based on the positions of the other beads:\n* **Case 1: All beads on the vertices**\n   * There are 6 choices for the first bead (any of the vertices).\n   * There are 5 choices for the second bead, and so on.\n   * This gives us 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720 ways to arrange the beads.\n   * However, we've overcounted because of the 6-fold rotational symmetry.  We need to divide by 6: 720 / 6 = 120 arrangements.\n* **Case 2: One bead on the center, five on the vertices**\n   * There are 6 choices for the bead on the center.\n   * There are 6 choices for the first bead on the vertex, then 5 choices for the next, and so on.\n   * This gives us 6 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 4320 ways.\n   * Again, we've overcounted due to symmetry. We divide by 6: 4320 / 6 = 720 arrangements.\n**4.  Total Arrangements**\nAdd the arrangements from each case: 120 + 720 = **840**\n**Therefore, there are 840 distinct ways to put the seven beads on the hexagonal grid, considering rotations and reflections as equivalent.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Consider the Center:**\n* There are 7 choices for the bead to be placed in the center of the hexagon.\n**2.  Consider the Adjacent Vertices:**\n* Once the center bead is placed, we have 6 colors left.\n* We can place any of these colors on one of the vertices adjacent to the center. \n* Since rotations are considered equivalent, we can choose any one of the 6 vertices without loss of generality. \n**3. Consider the Remaining Vertices:**\n* Now we have 5 colors left to place on the remaining 5 vertices.\n* Again, due to rotational symmetry, we can choose any one of the remaining vertices for the next color.\n**4. The Rest:**\n* We can continue this process for the remaining vertices.  \n**5. Calculating the Total Possibilities:**\n* Since we've made choices that account for rotational symmetry, we need to consider the initial choice of colors and divide by the number of rotations of the hexagon (which is 6).\nTherefore, the total number of distinct arrangements is:  \n(7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / 6 = **7! / 6 = 5040 / 6 = 840**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1.  Understanding the Problem**\nWe have seven beads, each a different color. We need to place them on the hexagonal grid.  Since rotations and reflections are considered the same, we need to account for this symmetry.\n**2.  Choosing a Reference Point**\nStart by focusing on one of the beads. It doesn't matter which one you choose, as all positions are equivalent due to symmetry. Let's place the first bead on the top vertex of the hexagon.\n**3.  Considering Rotations**\nIf we rotate the hexagon, the bead we placed at the top vertex will move to different positions. There are six possible positions for the first bead, which correspond to the six vertices of the hexagon.\n**4.  Counting Non-Equivalent Arrangements**\nSince we're treating rotations as equivalent, we've overcounted by a factor of 6. To correct this, we'll divide our final count by 6. \n**5.  Placing the Remaining Beads**\nNow we have six remaining beads to place. We can place them in any order. The number of ways to arrange six objects is 6! (6 factorial) which is 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720.\n**6.  Final Calculation**\nTo get the number of non-equivalent arrangements, we divide the number of possible arrangements (720) by the overcounting factor (6):\n720 / 6 = 120\n**Answer:** There are **120** ways to place seven beads of distinct colors on the hexagonal grid, considering rotations and reflections as equivalent. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1.  Count the total possible arrangements:**\n* There are 7 choices for the first bead, 6 for the second, and so on.\n* This gives us 7! = 5040 total arrangements *if* we counted rotations and reflections as different.\n**2.  Account for Rotations:**\n*  There are 6 different rotations of the hexagon (including the identity rotation, where we don't rotate at all).\n*  Each unique arrangement can be obtained by rotating any of its 6 rotations. \n*  Therefore, we've overcounted each arrangement 6 times.\n**3.  Account for Reflections:**\n* There are 6 lines of symmetry in a regular hexagon (lines connecting opposite vertices and lines connecting midpoints of opposite sides).\n* For each unique arrangement, there is a reflection across each of the 6 lines of symmetry that gives us a visually equivalent arrangement.\n* We've overcounted each arrangement 6 times due to reflections. \n**4.  Correcting for Overcounting:**\n* We've overcounted each unique arrangement by a factor of 6 (rotations) * 6 (reflections) = 36. \n* To get the number of unique arrangements, we divide the initial count (5040) by 36.\n**Final Calculation:**\n5040 / 36 = **140**\n**Therefore, there are 140 distinct ways to place the seven beads on the hexagonal grid, considering rotations and reflections as equivalent.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1.  Understanding the Symmetry**\n* **Rotation:** The hexagonal grid has rotational symmetry of order 6. This means we can rotate the arrangement by 60 degrees, 120 degrees, etc., and get an equivalent arrangement.\n* **Reflection:**  The hexagonal grid also has multiple lines of reflection symmetry.  \n**2.  Counting the Arrangements Without Considering Symmetry**\n* **First Bead:** We have 7 choices for the first bead.\n* **Second Bead:** We have 6 choices left for the second bead.\n* **Third Bead:** We have 5 choices left.\n* **And so on...**\nThis gives us a total of 7! (7 factorial) = 5040 arrangements if we don't consider symmetry.\n**3.  Accounting for the Overcounting**\n* **Rotation:** Since we have 6 rotational symmetries, we have overcounted each arrangement 6 times.\n* **Reflection:** The hexagonal grid has 6 lines of reflection symmetry. However, each reflection can be obtained by a combination of a rotation and a specific reflection. Therefore, the reflection symmetry is already accounted for by the rotational symmetry.\n**4.  Calculating the Final Answer**\nTo get the number of unique arrangements, we divide the total number of arrangements by the number of times each arrangement was overcounted:\n* **Final answer:** 5040 / 6 = **840**\n**Therefore, there are 840 distinct ways to arrange the seven beads on the hexagonal grid, considering rotations and reflections as equivalent.** \n"
