        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Focus on the Pilots**\n   We only care about the pilots, so we can ignore the other crew members for now. \n**2.  Total Possibilities**\n   * The first pilot has 6 choices (3 steak, 3 fish).\n   * The second pilot then has 5 choices left (since one meal is gone).\n   * This means there are 6 * 5 = 30 possible combinations of meals for the two pilots.\n**3.  Favorable Outcomes**\n   * We want both pilots to get fish.  \n   * The first pilot has 3 choices of fish.\n   * The second pilot then has 2 choices of fish left.\n   * This means there are 3 * 2 = 6 ways both pilots can get fish.\n**4.  Calculate the Probability**\n   Probability = (Favorable Outcomes) / (Total Possible Outcomes)\n   Probability = 6 / 30 = 1/5\n**Answer:** The probability that both pilots get the fish is **1/5**. \n",

Total Possibilities**\n* The first pilot can choose any of the 6 meals.\n* The second pilot can then choose any of the remaining 5 meals.\n* This gives us a total of 6 * 5 = 30 possible combinations of meals for the pilots.\n**2.  Favorable Possibilities**\n* We want both pilots to get fish.\n* There are 3 fish meals available.\n* The first pilot has 3 choices for a fish meal.\n* The second pilot then has 2 fish meals left to choose from.\n* This gives us 3 * 2 = 6 favorable combinations.\n**3.  Calculate the Probability**\n* Probability = (Favorable Outcomes) / (Total Possible Outcomes)\n* Probability = 6 / 30 = 1/5\n**Therefore, the probability that both pilots get the fish is 1/5 or 20%.** \n",
        "Here's how to break down the probability calculation step-by-step:\n**1. Total Possible Outcomes**\n* The first crew member can choose any of the 6 meals.\n* The second crew member can then choose from the remaining 5 meals.\n* This continues until the last crew member.\n* So, there are 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720 total possible ways to distribute the meals.\n**2. Favorable Outcomes**\n* We want to find the probability that both pilots get fish. Let's consider the steps:\n    * **Pilot 1:**  There are 3 fish meals available.\n    * **Pilot 2:** After Pilot 1 gets a fish meal, there are only 2 fish meals left.\n    * **The rest of the crew:** The remaining 4 crew members can get any of the remaining meals (we don't care about their choices for this specific scenario). This gives us 4! (4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24) possibilities.\n* So, the total number of favorable outcomes is 3 * 2 * 24 = 144.\n**3. Calculate the Probability**\n* Probability = (Favorable Outcomes) / (Total Possible Outcomes)\n* Probability = 144 / 720 \n* Probability = 1/5 \n**Therefore, the probability that both pilots get the fish is 1/5.** \n",

Total Possibilities:**\n* The first pilot can choose any of the 6 meals.\n* The second pilot can then choose from the remaining 5 meals. \n* This means there are 6 * 5 = 30 possible ways to assign the meals to the two pilots.\n**2.  Favorable Outcomes:**\n* For both pilots to get fish, the first pilot must choose a fish meal (there are 3 options).\n* The second pilot must then choose another fish meal (only 2 options remain).\n* This gives us 3 * 2 = 6 favorable outcomes.\n**3.

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Find the total possible outcomes:**\n* There are 6 crew members, and each can get one of two meals (steak or fish).\n*  The total number of ways to distribute the meals is 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 2\u2076 = 64\n**2. Find the number of favorable outcomes:**\n* **Step 1: Choose the two pilots who get fish:** There are 6C2 = 15 ways to choose 2 pilots out of 6. \n* **Step 2:  Assign the remaining meals:**  The remaining 4 crew members can get either steak or fish, so there are 2\u2074 = 16 ways to assign their meals.\n**3. Calculate the probability:**\n* **Probability = (Favorable Outcomes) / (Total Possible Outcomes)**\n* Probability = (15 * 16) / 64 = 240 / 64 = 15/4\n**Therefore, the probability that both pilots get the fish is 15/4 or approximately 3.75.** \n**Important Note:** The probability is greater than 1, which is impossible. This means our calculation has an error.  The mistake is in assuming that the remaining 4 crew members can get any combination of meals.  We need to account for the fact that 3 steak meals and 3 fish meals are set aside.\n**Corrected Approach:**\n* We need to figure out how many ways to assign the remaining meals (4 crew members) while keeping the constraint of 3 steak and 3 fish meals. \n*  Since there are 3 fish meals left, and we already gave 2 to the pilots, there's only 1 fish meal left for the remaining crew.  This means 3 of the remaining crew members must get steak.\n*  There are 4C3 = 4 ways to choose the 3 crew members who get steak.\n**Revised Calculation:**\n* **Favorable Outcomes:** 15 (ways to choose pilots) * 4 (ways to choose remaining crew getting steak) = 60\n* **Probability:** 60 / 64 = 15/16\n**Therefore, the correct probability that both pilots get the fish is 15/16.** \n"
