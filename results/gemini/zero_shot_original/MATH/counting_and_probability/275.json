    "solution": "First we count the arrangements if all the letters are unique, which is $11!$. Then since the I's, S's and the P's are not unique, we divide by $4!$, $4!$, and $2!$ for the arrangements of I's, S's, and P's, for an answer of $\\dfrac{11!}{4! \\times 4! \\times 2!} = \\boxed{34,\\!650}$.",

        "Here's how to determine the number of ways to arrange the letters of the word MISSISSIPPI:\n**1. Count the Letters**\n* M: 1\n* I: 4\n* S: 4\n* P: 2\n**2. Calculate the Total Number of Arrangements (Ignoring Repetition)**\nIf all the letters were unique, we'd have 11 letters, and the number of arrangements would be 11! (11 factorial).\n**3. Account for Repetitions**\nSince we have repetitions, we need to divide the total number of arrangements by the factorial of the count of each repeated letter:\n* Divide by 4! for the repeated 'I's.\n* Divide by 4! for the repeated 'S's.\n* Divide by 2! for the repeated 'P's.\n**4. The Final Calculation**\nThe number of ways to arrange the letters of MISSISSIPPI is:\n11! / (4! * 4! * 2!) = 34,650\n**Therefore, there are 34,650 distinct ways to arrange the letters of the word MISSISSIPPI.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Count the letters:**\n* There are 11 letters in the word MISSISSIPPI.\n**2. Identify repeating letters:**\n* M: 1\n* I: 4\n* S: 4\n* P: 2\n**3. Apply the formula:**\nThe number of ways to arrange *n* objects, where some are identical, is calculated as follows:\n```\nTotal arrangements = n! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nk!)\n```\nWhere:\n* n is the total number of objects\n* n1, n2, ... nk are the counts of each type of identical object.\n**4. Calculate:**\nIn our case:\n* n = 11\n* n1 = 4 (for the \"I\"s)\n* n2 = 4 (for the \"S\"s)\n* n3 = 2 (for the \"P\"s)\nSo, the number of arrangements is:\n```\n11! / (4! * 4! * 2!) \n= (11 * 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 * 2 * 1)\n= 34,650\n```\n**Therefore, there are 34,650 ways to arrange the letters of the word MISSISSIPPI.** \n",
