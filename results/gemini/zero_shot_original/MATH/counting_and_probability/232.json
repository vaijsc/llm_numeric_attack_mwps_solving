        "Here's how to solve this step-by-step:\n**Understanding Factorials**\n* A factorial (denoted by !) means multiplying a number by all the positive whole numbers less than it. \n* For example, 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120\n**Setting up the Problem**\nWe want to find the integer factor that makes this equation true:\n9! * x = 11!\n**Expanding the Factorials**\nLet's write out the factorials:\n(9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) * x = (11 * 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)\n**Simplifying**\nNotice that 9! appears on both sides of the equation.  We can cancel it out:\nx = 11 * 10\n**Solution**\nTherefore, x = 110.\n**Answer:** 9! must be multiplied by **110** to equal 11!. \n",
