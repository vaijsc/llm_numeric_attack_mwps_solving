The sum of the shortest three segments is $3+4+5=12$, but we quickly notice that it is impossible to start at one point and visit the other three points by traveling on a path with length $12$ ($DB$, $BC$, and $CD$ do not let us visit point $A$, and it is not possible to travel on $AD$, $CD$, and $BD$ in a continuous path). We now look for a path with length $13$ and notice that traveling from point $A$ to $D$ to $B$ to $C$ works. Alternatively, $B$ to $D$ to $C$ to $A$ also works. Both paths have length $\\boxed{13}$.",

        "Here's how to find the shortest distance:\n**Understanding the Problem**\nWe need to find the shortest route that starts at any of the four points (A, B, C, or D) and visits the other three points exactly once. This is a type of traveling salesman problem, but on a smaller scale.\n**Strategies**\n* **Brute Force:** We could list out all possible routes and calculate their distances. However, this becomes tedious with more points.\n* **Triangle Inequality:** The shortest distance between two points is a straight line. This means that any path that includes detours will be longer than a direct path.\n**Applying the Triangle Inequality**\n1. **Focus on Point D:**  Notice that point D is connected to all other points.  This means any route must pass through D.\n2. **Shortest Paths from D:**  Let's find the shortest distances from D to the other points:\n    * D to A: 5\n    * D to B: 3\n    * D to C: 4\n3. **Minimizing the Route:**  To minimize the total distance, we want to connect the shortest path from D to the next shortest, and so on.\n**The Optimal Route**\n* **Start at D:**  The shortest path from D is to B (distance 3).\n* **Next to C:**  From B, the shortest path to an unvisited point is to C (distance 5).\n* **Finally to A:**  From C, the shortest path to the remaining point is to A (distance 6).\n**Total Distance**\nThe shortest distance route is D-B-C-A, with a total distance of 3 + 5 + 6 = **14**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1.  Identify the shortest paths between each pair of points:**\n*  A to B: 6\n*  A to C: 6\n*  A to D: 5\n*  B to C: 5\n*  B to D: 3\n*  C to D: 4\n**2. Consider all possible routes and their lengths:**\nLet's use the notation \"ABCD\" to represent a route starting at A, going to B, then C, then D. Here are the possible routes and their total distances:\n* **ABCD:** 6 + 5 + 4 = 15\n* **ABDC:** 6 + 3 + 4 = 13\n* **ACBD:** 6 + 4 + 3 = 13\n* **ACDB:** 6 + 4 + 5 = 15\n* **ADBC:** 5 + 3 + 5 = 13\n* **ADCB:** 5 + 4 + 5 = 14\n**3. Determine the shortest route:**\nThe shortest routes are **ABDC, ACBD, and ADBD** all with a distance of **13**.\n**Therefore, the shortest distance that can be traveled is 13 units.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Identify Potential Paths:**\n* **Starting at A:** We have three possible paths: \n    * A -> D -> B -> C\n    * A -> B -> D -> C\n    * A -> C -> D -> B \n* **Starting at B:**  We have three possible paths:\n    * B -> A -> D -> C\n    * B -> D -> A -> C\n    * B -> C -> D -> A\n* **Starting at C:** We have three possible paths:\n    * C -> A -> D -> B\n    * C -> D -> A -> B\n    * C -> B -> D -> A\n* **Starting at D:** We have three possible paths:\n    * D -> A -> B -> C\n    * D -> B -> A -> C\n    * D -> C -> A -> B\n**2. Calculate the Distance for Each Path:**\nLet's take an example, starting at point A:\n* **A -> D -> B -> C:** 5 + 3 + 5 = 13\n* **A -> B -> D -> C:** 6 + 3 + 4 = 13\n* **A -> C -> D -> B:** 6 + 4 + 3 = 13\nWe would need to calculate the distance for each possible path from each starting point.\n**3. Compare Distances and Find the Shortest:**\nAfter calculating the distance for every possible path, we would compare them to find the shortest distance.\n**Shortcut:**\nNotice that the shortest path will always involve the shortest sides: 3, 4, and 5.  This means we can find the shortest path by simply adding these three sides together: 3 + 4 + 5 = **12**.\n**Therefore, the shortest distance that can be travelled if you start at any point, A, B, C, or D, and visit the other three points once is 12.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**Understanding the Problem**\nWe want to find the shortest route that starts at one of the four points (A, B, C, or D) and visits the other three points exactly once. This is a type of traveling salesman problem, but with a smaller scale.\n**Possible Routes**\nWe need to consider all possible starting points and the order in which we visit the other points.  Here's a way to organize our thinking:\n* **Starting at A:**  \n    * A -> B -> C -> D\n    * A -> C -> B -> D\n    * A -> D -> B -> C\n    * A -> D -> C -> B\n* **Starting at B:**\n    * B -> A -> C -> D\n    * B -> C -> A -> D\n    * B -> D -> A -> C\n    * B -> D -> C -> A\n* **Starting at C:**\n    * C -> A -> B -> D\n    * C -> B -> A -> D\n    * C -> D -> A -> B\n    * C -> D -> B -> A\n* **Starting at D:**\n    * D -> A -> B -> C\n    * D -> A -> C -> B\n    * D -> B -> A -> C\n    * D -> B -> C -> A\n**Calculating Distances**\nNow, we need to calculate the total distance for each route. For example, let's calculate the distance for the route \"A -> B -> C -> D\":\n* A -> B: 6\n* B -> C: 5\n* C -> D: 4\n* Total: 6 + 5 + 4 = 15\nDo this for all the routes and keep track of the shortest distance you find.\n**Finding the Shortest Route**\nAfter calculating the distances for all possible routes, you'll discover the shortest route is **D -> A -> B -> C** with a total distance of **15**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1.  Understanding the Problem**\nWe need to find the shortest route that starts at one of the points (A, B, C, or D) and visits the other three points exactly once. This is a classic traveling salesman problem, which is quite difficult in general.\n**2.  Trial and Error (with a bit of intuition)**\n* **Start at D:**  It seems likely that starting at D is a good idea since it's connected to all the other points. \n* **Next stop:**  Going from D to B is the shortest path (3 units).\n* **Next stop:**  From B, it's shortest to go to C (5 units).\n* **Final stop:**  From C, we must go to A (6 units).\n**3. Calculate the total distance:**\nThe total distance for the path D -> B -> C -> A is 3 + 5 + 6 = **14 units**.\n**4. Checking other possibilities**\nWhile we found a path of length 14, we should quickly check if starting at the other points might give us a shorter path. \n* **Starting at A:**  The shortest path would likely be A -> D -> B -> C, but this still adds up to 14 units. \n* **Starting at B:**  We would likely need to go to D first, then either A or C, resulting in a distance greater than or equal to 14 units.\n* **Starting at C:**  Similar to starting at B, we would likely need to go to D first, leading to a distance greater than or equal to 14 units.\n**Conclusion**\nThe shortest distance that can be traveled visiting all four points is **14 units**, achieved by the path D -> B -> C -> A. \n"
