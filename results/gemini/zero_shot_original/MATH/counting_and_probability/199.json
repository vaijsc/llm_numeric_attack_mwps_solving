    "solution": "The number of ways to roll exactly 2 6's is $\\binom{5}{2}5^3$, since there are $\\binom{5}{2}$ choices for which of the two dice are 6, and there are 5 choices for each of the other 3 dice. Similarly, the number of ways to roll exactly 1 6 is $\\binom{5}{1}5^4$, and the number of ways to roll no 6's is $\\binom{5}{0}5^5$.

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Understanding \"At Most 2\"**\n\"At most 2\" means we want to find the probability of getting a 6:\n* **Zero times:**\n* **One time:**\n* **Two times:**\n**2.  Calculating Each Case**\n* **Zero times:**  \n   * The probability of not rolling a 6 on a single roll is 5/6.\n   * The probability of not rolling a 6 in 5 rolls is (5/6) ^ 5 \n* **One time:**\n   * The probability of getting a 6 on one specific roll and not on the others is (1/6) * (5/6) ^ 4.\n   * Since the 6 can occur on any of the 5 rolls, we multiply this probability by 5.\n* **Two times:**\n   * The probability of getting a 6 on two specific rolls and not on the others is (1/6) ^ 2 * (5/6) ^ 3.\n   * Since the 6s can occur on any two of the 5 rolls, we need to figure out how many ways to choose 2 rolls out of 5 (this is a combination, denoted by 5C2, which is 10).\n**3.  Adding the Probabilities**\nThe total probability is the sum of the probabilities of each case:\n(5/6) ^ 5 + 5 * (1/6) * (5/6) ^ 4 + 10 * (1/6) ^ 2 * (5/6) ^ 3\n**4.  Simplifying**\nYou can calculate this directly or use a calculator to find the approximate probability.\n**Answer:** The probability of getting a 6 in at most 2 of the 5 rolls is approximately **0.965**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Possible Outcomes:**\n* We have a fair 6-sided die, so each roll has 6 possible outcomes.\n* We roll the die 5 times, so the total number of possible outcomes is 6 * 6 * 6 * 6 * 6 = 6^5 = 7776.\n**2.  Favorable Outcomes:**\n* We need to find the number of outcomes where we get a 6 at most 2 times. This means we need to consider these cases:\n    * **Case 1: Zero 6's**\n    * **Case 2: One 6**\n    * **Case 3: Two 6's**\n**3.  Calculate Each Case:**\n* **Case 1: Zero 6's**\n    * For each roll, we have 5 options (1, 2, 3, 4, 5).\n    * Total outcomes for this case: 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 = 5^5 = 3125\n* **Case 2: One 6**\n    * We need to choose one of the five rolls to be a 6 (5 options).\n    * The other four rolls must be a number other than 6 (5 options each).\n    * Total outcomes for this case: 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 = 5^5 = 3125\n* **Case 3: Two 6's**\n    * We need to choose two of the five rolls to be 6's (combinations of 5 choose 2, which is 10 options).\n    * The other three rolls must be a number other than 6 (5 options each).\n    * Total outcomes for this case: 10 * 5 * 5 * 5 = 1250\n**4.  Total Favorable Outcomes:**\n* Add the outcomes from all three cases: 3125 + 3125 + 1250 = 7500\n**5.  Probability:**\n* Probability = (Favorable Outcomes) / (Total Possible Outcomes)\n* Probability = 7500 / 7776 \n* Probability \u2248 0.966\n**Therefore, the probability of getting a 6 in at most 2 of the 5 rolls is approximately 0.966 or 96.6%.** \n",
        "Here's how to break down the problem and find the probability:\n**1. Define the Event:**\n* We want the probability of getting a 6 in at most 2 of the 5 rolls.  This means 0, 1, or 2 sixes are acceptable.\n**2. Calculate the Probability of Each Case:**\n* **Case 1: No sixes (0 sixes)**\n   * Probability of not rolling a 6 on a single roll: 5/6\n   * Probability of not rolling a 6 in 5 rolls: (5/6) ^ 5 = 243/7776\n* **Case 2: One six (1 six)**\n   * Probability of rolling a 6: 1/6\n   * Probability of not rolling a 6: 5/6\n   * We need to consider all the possible positions for the six. There are 5 options: 6-not-not-not-not, not-6-not-not-not, etc.\n   * Probability of each specific arrangement with one six: (1/6) * (5/6) ^ 4 = 625/7776\n   * Total probability for case 2: 5 * (625/7776) = 3125/7776\n* **Case 3: Two sixes (2 sixes)**\n   * Probability of rolling two sixes: (1/6) * (1/6) = 1/36\n   * Probability of rolling three non-sixes: (5/6) ^ 3 = 125/216\n   * We need to consider all the possible positions for the two sixes. There are 10 options: 6-6-not-not-not, 6-not-6-not-not, etc. (Think of combinations, 5 choose 2)\n   * Probability of each specific arrangement with two sixes: (1/36) * (125/216) = 125/7776\n   * Total probability for case 3: 10 * (125/7776) = 1250/7776\n**3.

        "Here's how to break down the problem and solve it:\n**1. Understand the Problem**\nWe need to find the probability of getting a 6 at most twice in five rolls. \"At most twice\" means we can get a 6 zero, one, or two times.\n**2. Calculate the Probability of Each Case**\n* **Case 1: Zero 6s**\n   - The probability of not getting a 6 on a single roll is 5/6 (since there are 5 other numbers).\n   - The probability of not getting a 6 in 5 rolls is (5/6)^5.\n* **Case 2: One 6**\n   - The probability of getting a 6 on one specific roll is 1/6.\n   - The probability of not getting a 6 on the other four rolls is (5/6)^4.\n   - Since the 6 can occur on any of the five rolls, we need to multiply this probability by 5 (for the different combinations).\n   - The total probability for this case is 5 * (1/6) * (5/6)^4.\n* **Case 3: Two 6s**\n   - The probability of getting a 6 on two specific rolls is (1/6)^2.\n   - The probability of not getting a 6 on the other three rolls is (5/6)^3.\n   - We need to account for the different combinations of getting two 6s in five rolls. This can be calculated using combinations: 5C2 = 10.\n   - The total probability for this case is 10 * (1/6)^2 * (5/6)^3.\n**3. Sum the Probabilities**\nTo get the probability of getting a 6 at most twice, we add the probabilities of each case:\n(5/6)^5 + 5 * (1/6) * (5/6)^4 + 10 * (1/6)^2 * (5/6)^3 \n**4. Simplify and Calculate**\nThis simplifies to approximately 0.6723.\n**Therefore, the probability of getting a 6 at most twice in five rolls is approximately 0.6723 or 67.23%.** \n",
        "Here's how to break down the problem and solve it:\n**1. Define the Events**\n* **Success:**  Rolling a 6.\n* **Failure:** Rolling any number other than a 6.\n**2. Calculate Probabilities**\n* **Probability of success (P(S))**: 1/6 (one favorable outcome out of six)\n* **Probability of failure (P(F))**: 5/6 (five unfavorable outcomes out of six)\n**3. Consider the Possible Scenarios**\nTo get a 6 in at most 2 of the 5 rolls, we need to consider these scenarios:\n* **Scenario 1: 0 sixes** \n   * This means all 5 rolls are failures: P(F) * P(F) * P(F) * P(F) * P(F) = (5/6)^5\n* **Scenario 2: 1 six**\n   *  We need to figure out the probability of getting one six in any of the five positions. We can represent this as:\n      *  SFSSS (where S is a success, F is a failure) \n      *  FSSSF\n      *  ... and so on\n   *  There are 5 different positions the six could be in.  The probability for each position is: (1/6) * (5/6)^4.  Since there are 5 positions, the total probability for this scenario is 5 * (1/6) * (5/6)^4.\n* **Scenario 3: 2 sixes**\n   * This follows the same logic as scenario 2, but now we need to consider all the different combinations for getting two sixes in five rolls. We can use combinations here: \n      *  The number of ways to choose 2 positions out of 5 is  \u2075C\u2082 = 10 (using the combination formula).\n      *  The probability of each specific combination (e.g., SSFFF) is (1/6)^2 * (5/6)^3\n      *  The total probability for this scenario is 10 * (1/6)^2 * (5/6)^3\n**4.  Sum the Probabilities**\nSince these scenarios are mutually exclusive (they can't happen at the same time), we can add their probabilities to find the overall probability of getting a 6 in at most 2 rolls:\nProbability = (5/6)^5 + 5 * (1/6) * (5/6)^4 + 10 * (1/6)^2 * (5/6)^3 \n**5. Simplify and Calculate**\nCalculate the values:\nProbability \u2248 0.4019 \n**Answer:** The probability of getting a 6 in at most 2 of the 5 rolls is approximately 0.4019 or about 40.19%. \n"
