    "solution": "Let $m$ denote the number of main courses needed to meet the requirement. Then the number of dinners available is $3\\cdot m \\cdot 2m = 6m^2$.  Thus $m^2$ must be at least $365/6 \\approx 61$.  Since $7^2 = 49<61<64 = 8^2$, $\\boxed{8}$ main courses is enough, but 7 is not.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Days in a Year:**\n* There are 365 days in the year 2003.\n**2. Dessert Options:**\n* The restaurant offers 3 dessert choices.\n**3. Combinations of Appetizers and Main Courses:**\n* To have a different dinner every night, we need enough combinations of appetizers and main courses to cover the 365 days, after accounting for the dessert choices. \n* Since we have 3 dessert options, each combination of appetizer and main course will create 3 distinct dinner options. \n* Therefore, we need 365 dinners / 3 desserts per combination = 121.67 combinations of appetizers and main courses.  Since we can't have fractions of combinations, we need at least 122 combinations.\n**4. Let 'x' be the number of main courses:**\n* The restaurant offers twice as many appetizers as main courses, so there are 2x appetizers.\n**5. Total Combinations:**\n* The total number of combinations is the number of appetizers multiplied by the number of main courses: 2x * x = 2x\u00b2\n**6. Solving for 'x':**\n* We need at least 122 combinations, so: 2x\u00b2 \u2265 122\n* Divide both sides by 2: x\u00b2 \u2265 61\n* The smallest whole number that satisfies this inequality is x = 8 (since 8\u00b2 = 64)\n**Answer:** The restaurant should offer at least **8** main courses. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Calculate the Number of Possible Dinners:**\n* There are 3 choices for dessert.\n* Let 'm' represent the number of main courses.\n* There are 2m choices for appetizers.\n* The total number of possible dinner combinations is 3 * m * 2m = 6m\u00b2\n**2.  The Number of Dinners Needed:**\n*  There are 365 days in 2003. \n**3.  Set Up an Inequality:**\n* We need the number of dinner combinations (6m\u00b2) to be at least as great as the number of days in the year (365): \n   6m\u00b2 \u2265 365\n**4.  Solve for 'm':**\n* Divide both sides by 6: m\u00b2 \u2265 60.83\n* Find the smallest integer value of 'm' that satisfies this inequality. Since 8\u00b2 = 64, m = 8 is the smallest value that works.\n**Answer:** The restaurant should offer at least **8** main courses to ensure a customer can have a different dinner each night in 2003. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Calculate the number of possible dinners:**\n* There are 365 days in 2003.  \n* To have a different dinner every night, the restaurant needs at least 365 unique dinner combinations.\n**2.  Consider the relationships between menu items:**\n* Let 'm' represent the number of main courses.\n* The restaurant has '2m' appetizers (twice the number of main courses).\n* There are 3 dessert options.\n**3.  Determine the total number of dinner combinations:**\n* The total number of dinner combinations is found by multiplying the number of choices for each course:  m * 2m * 3 = 6m\u00b2\n**4.  Set up an inequality:**\n* We want the number of dinner combinations (6m\u00b2) to be at least 365: 6m\u00b2 \u2265 365\n**5.  Solve for 'm':**\n* Divide both sides by 6: m\u00b2 \u2265 60.83\n* Take the square root of both sides: m \u2265 7.8 \n**6.  Round up to the nearest whole number:**\n* Since we need a whole number of main courses, the restaurant must offer at least **8** main courses. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Count the Days:**\n* There are 365 days in the year 2003.\n**2.  Consider Dessert Options:**\n* The restaurant has 3 dessert options.\n**3.  Minimize Main Courses:**\n* To have the least number of main courses, we want to maximize the number of combinations using appetizers.  \n* Since there are twice as many appetizers as main courses, we'll figure out how many combinations of appetizers and main courses we need for each dessert.\n**4.  Calculate Combinations Needed:**\n* To have a different dinner each night, we need 365 unique combinations. \n* Since we have 3 dessert options, we need to make 365 / 3 = 121.67 combinations for each dessert.  Since we can't have a fraction of a combination, we'll round up to 122 combinations per dessert.\n**5.  Find the Minimum Main Courses:**\n* Let 'm' represent the number of main courses.  \n* There are 2m appetizers.\n* To have 122 combinations per dessert, we need: m * 2m = 122\n* This simplifies to 2m\u00b2 = 122\n* Divide both sides by 2: m\u00b2 = 61\n* Take the square root of both sides: m \u2248 7.81\n**6.  Round Up:**\n* Since we can't have a fraction of a main course, we round up to the nearest whole number:  m = 8\n**Answer:** The restaurant needs to offer at least **8** main courses. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Relationships**\n* **Appetizers and Main Courses:** The restaurant offers twice as many appetizers as main courses.  Let's say they offer 'm' main courses. This means they offer 2m appetizers.\n* **Dinners:** Each dinner consists of one appetizer, one main course, and one dessert.\n**2. Calculate Dinner Combinations**\n* **Choices:** The customer has 'm' choices for main courses, 2m choices for appetizers, and 3 choices for desserts.\n* **Total Combinations:** To find the total number of possible dinner combinations, we multiply the number of choices for each part: m * 2m * 3 = 6m\u00b2\n**3.  Minimum Main Courses for a Year**\n* **Days in 2003:**  2003 was not a leap year, so it had 365 days.\n* **Minimum Main Courses:**  We need to find the smallest value of 'm' where 6m\u00b2 is greater than or equal to 365.\n**4. Solve the Inequality**\n*  6m\u00b2 \u2265 365\n*  m\u00b2 \u2265 60.83\n*  m \u2265 \u221a60.83 \u2248 7.8\n**5. The Answer**\nSince we need a whole number of main courses, the restaurant should offer at least **8** main courses. This will give them enough variety to offer a different dinner combination every night of the year. \n"
