    "solution": "The beads will all be red at the end of the third draw precisely when two  green beads are chosen in the three draws. If the first bead drawn is  green, then there will be one  green and three red beads in the bag before the second draw. So the probability that  green beads are drawn in the first two draws is $$\n\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{1}{4}= \\frac{1}{8}.\n$$ The probability that a  green bead is chosen, then a red bead, and then a  green bead, is $$\n\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{3}{4}\\cdot\\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{32}.\n$$ Finally, the probability that a red bead is chosen then two  green beads is $$\n\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{16}.\n$$ The sum of these probabilities is $$\n\\frac{1}{8}+ \\frac{3}{32}+ \\frac{1}{16}= \\boxed{\\frac{9}{32}}.\n$$",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n* **Step 1: After the first replacement** \n   * You start with 2 red and 2 green beads.\n   * You replace a bead with a red bead, regardless of what you pulled out.\n   * Now you have 3 red beads and 2 green beads.\n* **Step 2: After the second replacement**\n   * You have 3 red and 2 green beads.\n   * You replace a bead with a red bead.\n   * Now you have 4 red beads and 2 green beads.\n* **Step 3: After the third replacement**\n   * You have 4 red and 2 green beads.\n   * You replace a bead with a red bead.\n   * Now you have 5 red beads and 2 green beads.\n* **Final Probability**\n   * To have all red beads, you need to replace one of the two remaining green beads with a red bead.\n   * The probability of picking a green bead is 2/7 (2 green beads out of 7 total).\n   * Therefore, the probability of picking a red bead (and thus getting all red beads) is **5/7**. \n",
        "Here's how to break down the problem:\n* **Step 1:** After the first replacement, there are 3 red beads and 2 green beads.\n* **Step 2:**  The probability of drawing a green bead is 2/5. If you draw a green bead, it gets replaced with a red bead, so you'll have 4 red beads and 1 green bead. The probability of drawing a red bead is 3/5, and it will be replaced with a red bead, so you'll have 4 red beads and 2 green beads.\n* **Step 3:** The probability of drawing a green bead is 2/6. If you draw a green bead, it gets replaced with a red bead, so you'll have 5 red beads and 1 green bead. The probability of drawing a red bead is 4/6, and it will be replaced with a red bead, so you'll have 5 red beads and 2 green beads. \nTherefore, the probability that all beads in the bag are red after three such replacements is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}} \\cdot \\frac{3}{5} \\cdot \\frac{4}{6} = \\boxed{\\frac{2}{15}}$.",

To achieve this, you need to pull out a green bead on the next two draws.\n* The probability of pulling out a green bead is 2/7 (2 green beads out of 7 total).\n* The probability of pulling out another green bead after that is 1/6 (since one green bead is gone).\n* To get the probability of both events happening, we multiply: (2/7) * (1/6) = **1/21**\n**Therefore, the probability that all beads in the bag are red after three replacements is 1/21.** \n",
