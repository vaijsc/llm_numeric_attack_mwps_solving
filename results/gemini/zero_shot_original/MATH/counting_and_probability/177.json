        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Possible Outcomes for Each Die:**\n* **Die 1:**  Can land on 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, or 3.\n* **Die 2:** Can land on 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, or 6.\n**2. Determine When the Sum is Odd:**\nTo get an odd sum, you need one even number and one odd number.  Let's look at the possibilities:\n* **Die 1 (Odd) + Die 2 (Even):**  This will always result in an odd sum.\n* **Die 1 (Even) + Die 2 (Odd):** This will always result in an odd sum.\n**3. Calculate the Probability:**\n* **Favorable Outcomes:**  We need to figure out how many combinations result in an odd sum. \n    * Die 1 can land on 1, 1, 3, or 3 (4 outcomes) and Die 2 can land on 4, 4, 6, or 6 (4 outcomes).  This gives us 4 * 4 = 16 combinations.\n    * Die 1 can land on 2, 2 (2 outcomes) and Die 2 can land on 5, 5 (2 outcomes). This gives us 2 * 2 = 4 combinations.\n    * In total, there are 16 + 4 = 20 favorable outcomes.\n* **Total Possible Outcomes:** Each die has 6 possible outcomes, so there are 6 * 6 = 36 total possible combinations.\n**4. Calculate the Probability:**\nProbability = (Favorable Outcomes) / (Total Possible Outcomes) \nProbability = 20 / 36 = 5/9\n**Therefore, the probability that the sum will be odd is 5/9.** \n",
