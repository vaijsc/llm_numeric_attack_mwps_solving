        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Calculate the probability of drawing a red marble first.**\n* There are 12 red marbles and 18 total marbles.\n* The probability of drawing a red marble is 12/18 = 2/3.\n**2. Calculate the probability of drawing a blue marble second (after taking out a red marble).**\n* Since we're not replacing the red marble, there are only 17 marbles left.\n* There are still 6 blue marbles.\n* The probability of drawing a blue marble now is 6/17.\n**3. Calculate the probability of drawing a blue marble first and a red marble second.**\n* This follows the same logic as step 2, just with the colors reversed. \n* The probability of drawing a blue marble first is 6/18 = 1/3.\n* The probability of drawing a red marble second is 12/17.\n**4. Combine the probabilities.**\n* We need to consider both possibilities: red then blue, OR blue then red.\n* Since these are separate events, we add the probabilities:\n(2/3) * (6/17)  +  (1/3) * (12/17) = 4/17 + 4/17 = **8/17**\n**Therefore, the probability of selecting one red marble and one blue marble is 8/17.** \n",

Consider the possible scenarios:**\n* **Scenario 1:** You draw a red marble first, then a blue marble.\n* **Scenario 2:** You draw a blue marble first, then a red marble.\n**2. Calculate the probability of each scenario:**\n* **Scenario 1:** \n   - Probability of drawing a red marble first: 12 (red marbles) / 18 (total marbles) = 2/3\n   - Probability of drawing a blue marble second (after taking out a red marble): 6 (blue marbles) / 17 (remaining marbles) = 6/17\n   - Probability of Scenario 1: (2/3) * (6/17) = 4/17\n* **Scenario 2:**\n   - Probability of drawing a blue marble first: 6 (blue marbles) / 18 (total marbles) = 1/3\n   - Probability of drawing a red marble second (after taking out a blue marble): 12 (red marbles) / 17 (remaining marbles) = 12/17\n   - Probability of Scenario 2: (1/3) * (12/17) = 4/17\n**3.
