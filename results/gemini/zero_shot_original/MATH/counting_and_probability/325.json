        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding Factorials**\n*  A factorial (denoted by !) means multiplying a number by all the positive integers less than it. For example, 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.\n**The Key Observation**\n* Notice that for any number greater than or equal to 10, its factorial will have at least two trailing zeros. This is because 10 = 2 * 5, and any factorial greater than or equal to 10 will include both a 2 and a 5 as factors.\n**Simplifying the Problem**\n*  Since 10! and all factorials after it have at least two trailing zeros, they won't contribute to the tens digit of the sum. \n*  Therefore, we only need to consider the sum 7! + 8! + 9!\n**Calculating the Sum**\n* 7! = 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 5040\n* 8! = 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 40320\n* 9! = 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 362880\nAdding these together: 5040 + 40320 + 362880 = 408240\n**The Answer**\nThe tens digit in the sum 7! + 8! + 9! + ... + 2006! is **4**. \n",

For example, 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.\n**Key Observation**\n* Notice that for any number greater than or equal to 10, the factorial will contain the factors 2 and 5.  This means that the factorial will be a multiple of 10, and therefore will end in a zero.\n**The Calculation**\n1. **Initial Terms:** 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320, and 9! = 362880 all end in a zero.\n2. **All Subsequent Terms:** Every factorial from 10! onwards will also end in a zero.\n**The Result**\n* Since all the factorials from 7! onward are multiples of 10, the sum will also be a multiple of 10. This means the units digit of the sum is 0.\n*  **The tens digit of the sum will be the same as the tens digit of 7! + 8! + 9!**  (because the other factorials don't contribute to the tens digit).\n*  7! + 8! + 9! = 5040 + 40320 + 362880 = 408240.  \n**Therefore, the tens digit in the sum 7! + 8! + 9! + ... + 2006! is 4.** \n",
