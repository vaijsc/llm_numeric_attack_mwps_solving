    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Treating the 16 blocks as distinct, we can choose ${16 \\choose 2} = 120$ pairs of blocks. Of these, since there are 4 blue blocks, ${4 \\choose 2} = 6$ are blue pairs. So, the probability of getting a blue pair of blocks is $\\frac{6}{120} =\\boxed{ \\frac{1}{20}}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Probability of the first block being blue:**\n* There are 4 blue blocks and 16 total blocks.\n* The probability of picking a blue block first is 4/16.\n**2. Probability of the second block being blue (given the first was blue):**\n* After taking out one blue block, there are only 3 blue blocks left and 15 total blocks.\n* The probability of picking another blue block is 3/15.\n**3. Combined Probability:**\n* To get the probability of both events happening, we multiply the individual probabilities: (4/16) * (3/15) = 12/240\n**4. Simplifying the fraction:**\n* 12/240 simplifies to **1/20**.\n**Therefore, the probability of picking two blue blocks is 1/20.** \n",
