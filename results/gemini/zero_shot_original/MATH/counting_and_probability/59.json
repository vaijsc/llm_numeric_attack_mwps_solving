    "solution": "Let's count as our outcomes the ways to select 3 people without regard to order.  There are $\\binom{10}{3} = 120$ ways to select any 3 people.  The number of successful outcomes is the number of ways to select 3 consecutive people.  There are only 10 ways to do this -- think of first selecting the middle person, then we take his or her two neighbors.  Therefore, the probability is $\\frac{10}{120} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{12}}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Total Possible Outcomes**\n* There are 10 people, and we need to choose 3.  The order doesn't matter (it's just who gives the presentation, not the order they go in), so we use combinations:\n   *  \u00b9\u2070C\u2083 = (10!)/(3!7!) = 120 \n   * There are 120 different ways to choose 3 people out of 10.\n**2.  Favorable Outcomes (Consecutive Seats)**\n* Imagine the 10 people sitting in a circle.  Let's fix one person's position as a reference point.\n* To have consecutive seats, the other two chosen people must be the person to the right and the person to the left of the first person.\n* There are 10 different starting positions (since we can rotate the circle).  \n* For each starting position, there's only one way to choose the other two people to make a consecutive group.\n**3. Calculate the Probability**\n* **Probability = (Favorable Outcomes) / (Total Possible Outcomes)**\n* Probability = 10 / 120 = 1/12\n**Therefore, the probability that the three chosen people were sitting in consecutive seats is 1/12.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Total Possible Outcomes:**\n* The first person can be chosen in 10 ways.\n* The second person can be chosen in 9 ways (since one person is already chosen).\n* The third person can be chosen in 8 ways.\nTherefore, the total number of ways to choose 3 people out of 10 is 10 * 9 * 8 = 720. However, we've overcounted because the order we choose them in doesn't matter. \n* We've counted each group of 3 people 3! (3*2*1 = 6) times (e.g., ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, CBA).\nSo, the actual number of ways to choose 3 people out of 10 is 720 / 6 = 120.\n**2. Favorable Outcomes (Consecutive Seating):**\n* Imagine the table as a circle.  We can fix one person's position without loss of generality.  \n* The next two people must sit next to them. \n* There are 10 possible starting positions for the group of three.\n**3. Calculate the Probability:**\n* Probability = (Favorable Outcomes) / (Total Possible Outcomes)\n* Probability = 10 / 120 = 1/12\n**Therefore, the probability that the three chosen people were sitting in consecutive seats is 1/12.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Total Possible Arrangements:**\n* There are 10 people, so for the first seat, we have 10 choices.\n* For the second seat, we have 9 choices left.\n* For the third seat, we have 8 choices left. \n*  ...and so on.\nHowever, since it's a round table, we've overcounted! Rotating everyone by one seat results in the same arrangement.  Therefore, we need to divide by the number of seats to correct for overcounting.\n* Total arrangements: (10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / 10 = 9!\n**2. Arrangements Where Three Sit Consecutively:**\n* **Treat the three consecutive people as a unit:** Imagine tying them together.  Now we have 8 \"units\" to arrange (7 individuals plus the group of 3). \n* **Arrange the units:** There are 8! ways to arrange these 8 units.\n* **Arrange the three people within their group:**  The three people within their group can be arranged in 3! ways (3 * 2 * 1 = 6).\n**3. Calculate the Probability:**\n* **Favorable arrangements:**  8! * 3!\n* **Total arrangements:** 9!\n* **Probability:** (8! * 3!) / 9! = (8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) * (3 * 2 * 1) / (9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 3/9 = **1/3**\n**Therefore, the probability that the three chosen people were sitting in consecutive seats is 1/3.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Total Possible Combinations:**\n* There are 10 people, and we need to choose 3. The total number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula: \u00b9\u2070C\u2083 = (10!)/(3!7!) = 120\n**2. Favorable Combinations (Consecutive Seats):**\n* Imagine the 10 people are numbered 1 through 10 around the table.  To have consecutive seats, we can think of them as a group:\n    * Group 1:  1, 2, 3\n    * Group 2:  2, 3, 4\n    * Group 3:  3, 4, 5\n    * ... and so on, until\n    * Group 10: 10, 1, 2 \n* There are 10 of these consecutive groups. \n**3. Calculate the Probability:**\n* The probability of choosing three people sitting in consecutive seats is the number of favorable combinations divided by the total number of combinations:\n    Probability = (Favorable Combinations) / (Total Combinations) = 10 / 120 = 1/12\n**Therefore, the probability that the three chosen people were sitting in consecutive seats is 1/12.** \n",
