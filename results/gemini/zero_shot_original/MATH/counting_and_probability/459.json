    "solution": "There are $\\binom{9}{2}=36$ pairs of points in $S$, and each pair determines a line. However, there are three horizontal, three vertical, and two diagonal lines that pass through three points of $S$, and these lines are each determined by three different pairs of points in $S$. Thus the number of distinct lines is $36 - 2 \\cdot 8= \\boxed{20}$.",

        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\n* We have a set of points in the coordinate plane. Each point has x and y coordinates that can be -1, 0, or 1.\n* We need to find how many distinct lines can be drawn that pass through at least two of these points.\n**2. Visualizing the Points**\n* Plot the points on a coordinate plane. You'll notice a 3x3 grid of points.\n**3. Identifying Lines**\n* **Horizontal and Vertical Lines:** There are 3 horizontal lines and 3 vertical lines passing through the points.\n* **Diagonal Lines:** There are two sets of diagonal lines:\n    * One set with a slope of 1 (going up and to the right)\n    * One set with a slope of -1 (going down and to the right)\n    * Each set contains 3 distinct lines.\n**4. Counting the Lines**\n* We have a total of 3 (horizontal) + 3 (vertical) + 3 (diagonal, slope 1) + 3 (diagonal, slope -1) = **12 distinct lines**.\n**Therefore, there are 12 distinct lines that pass through at least two members of the set S.** \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Problem**\nImagine a 3x3 grid where the points of S are the intersections of the grid lines.\n**2.  Count the Lines**\n* **Horizontal and Vertical Lines:** There are 3 horizontal lines and 3 vertical lines passing through points in S.\n* **Diagonal Lines:** There are 4 diagonal lines with a slope of 1 and 4 diagonal lines with a slope of -1. \n**3.  Avoid Overcounting**\nNotice that some lines pass through more than two points. For example, the line y = 0 goes through the points (-1, 0), (0, 0), and (1, 0). We need to adjust our count to avoid counting these lines multiple times.\n**4.  The Final Count**\n* We have 3 + 3 = 6 horizontal and vertical lines.\n* We have 4 + 4 = 8 diagonal lines.\n* However, we've overcounted the horizontal and vertical lines that pass through the origin (0, 0) \u2013 there are 4 of these. \nTherefore, the total number of distinct lines passing through at least two points in S is 6 + 8 - 4 = **10**. \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Points**\nImagine a 3x3 grid in the coordinate plane. The points in set S will be the vertices of this grid:\n```\n(-1, 1)  (0, 1)  (1, 1)\n(-1, 0)  (0, 0)  (1, 0)\n(-1, -1) (0, -1) (1, -1) \n```\n**2. Consider Line Types**\nThere are three basic types of lines that can pass through these points:\n* **Horizontal Lines:**  There are 3 horizontal lines (y = 1, y = 0, y = -1).\n* **Vertical Lines:** There are 3 vertical lines (x = 1, x = 0, x = -1).\n* **Diagonal Lines:**  These lines will have slopes of 1 or -1. \n**3. Count Diagonal Lines**\n* **Slope 1:**  Notice that there are 3 diagonal lines with slope 1.  For example, one line passes through (-1, -1), (0, 0), and (1, 1).  \n* **Slope -1:** Similarly, there are 3 diagonal lines with slope -1.\n**4. Total Lines**\nAdding up the different line types, we have:\n* 3 horizontal lines + 3 vertical lines + 3 diagonal lines + 3 diagonal lines = **12 distinct lines**\n**Therefore, there are 12 distinct lines that pass through at least two members of set S.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step by step:\n**1. Visualize the points:**\nImagine a 3x3 grid where the points of the set S are placed. The points will be at the corners and center of this grid.\n**2. Consider the different line types:**\n* **Horizontal and Vertical Lines:**  There are 3 horizontal lines and 3 vertical lines passing through the points of S. \n* **Diagonal Lines:** There are two sets of diagonal lines:\n    * Lines with slope 1:  There are two lines with slope 1 that pass through at least two points of S.\n    * Lines with slope -1: There are two lines with slope -1 that pass through at least two points of S.\n**3. Count the total lines:**\n* Horizontal and Vertical: 3 + 3 = 6 lines\n* Diagonal: 2 + 2 = 4 lines\n**4.  Avoid Double Counting:**\nNotice that the lines passing through the center point (0,0) have been counted twice. We need to subtract those. The center point is on two horizontal, two vertical, and two diagonal lines. So, we need to subtract 6 from the total count.\n**5.  Calculate the final answer:**\n* Total Lines - Double Counted Lines = Distinct Lines\n* 6 + 4 - 6 = **4**\n**Therefore, there are 4 distinct lines that pass through at least two members of the set S.** \n",

There are 3 such lines.\n* **Slope of -1:** Consider the line passing through (-1, 1) and (0, 0).  This line also passes through (1, -1).  There are 3 such lines.\n**4. Total Distinct Lines**\nAdding up all the line types:\n* Horizontal: 3\n* Vertical: 3\n* Diagonal (slope 1): 3\n* Diagonal (slope -1): 3\n**Therefore, there are a total of 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12 distinct lines passing through at least two members of set *S*.** \n"
