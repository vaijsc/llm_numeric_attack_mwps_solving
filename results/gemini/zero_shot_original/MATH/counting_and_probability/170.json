        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n* **Fix the \"C\":** Since we always start with the \"C\", it's essentially fixed in place. We only need to figure out the arrangements of the remaining letters.\n* **Positions for the other letters:** We have 4 remaining positions for the letters \"O\", \"U\", \"N\", and \"T\".\n* **Choices for the first position:** We have 4 options for which letter goes in the first position after the \"C\".\n* **Choices for the second position:** Once we've placed the first letter, we only have 3 options left for the second position.\n* **Continuing the pattern:**  We continue in this way: 2 choices for the third position, and finally 1 choice for the last position.\nSo, the total number of different orders is: 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = **24** \n**Therefore, there are 24 different orders in which the letters can appear.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n* **Starting Point:** We always begin with the letter \"C.\"\n* **Second Letter:**  There are 4 remaining spots for the second letter.\n* **Third Letter:** After placing the second letter, there are 3 spots left for the third letter.\n* **Fourth Letter:** Two spots remain for the fourth letter.\n* **Fifth Letter:** The final letter automatically goes in the last spot.\nTherefore, the total number of different orders is: 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = **24** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n* **Start with C:**  Since we always begin with \"C,\" it's fixed in its position.\n* **Second Letter:** There are 4 remaining positions for the second letter (O, U, N, or T).\n* **Third Letter:** After placing the second letter, there are only 3 positions left for the third letter.\n* **Fourth Letter:** There are 2 positions remaining for the fourth letter.\n* **Fifth Letter:**  The final letter automatically goes in the last remaining position.\nTherefore, the total number of different orders is 4 * 3 * 2 = **24**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n* **Starting Point:** We always start with the letter \"C\", so that's fixed. \n* **Remaining Letters:** We have 4 remaining letters (O, U, N, T) that can be arranged in any order.\n* **Permutations:** The number of ways to arrange 4 distinct objects is 4!, which is 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24.\n**Therefore, there are 24 different orders in which the letters can appear around the circle.** \n",
