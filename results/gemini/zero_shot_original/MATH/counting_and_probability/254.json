    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "We can consider the two boys as one person, arrange the ``seven'' people first, then arrange the 2 boys.  So the number of seating arrangements in which the boys sit together is $7!\\times 2!=\\boxed{10,\\!080}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Treat the boys as one unit:**\nSince the boys must sit together, consider them as a single unit. Now we have 6 girls + 1 \"boy unit\" = 7 units to arrange.\n**2. Arrange the units:**\nThese 7 units can be arranged in 7! (7 factorial) ways.  7! = 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 5040 ways.\n**3. Arrange the boys within their unit:**\nThe two boys within their unit can swap positions (boy 1, boy 2 or boy 2, boy 1). This gives us 2! = 2 ways to arrange the boys.\n**4. Multiply to get the final answer:**\nTo get the total number of arrangements, multiply the arrangements of the units by the arrangements within the boy unit: 5040 * 2 = **10,080**\n**Therefore, there are 10,080 ways to arrange the 6 girls and 2 boys in a row if the boys must sit together.** \n",

Now you have 7 entities to arrange: 6 girls and the \"boy unit.\"\n**2. Arrange the units:**\nThese 7 entities can be arranged in 7! (7 factorial) ways, which is 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 5040.\n**3. Arrange the boys within their unit:**\nThe two boys can swap positions within their unit in 2! (2 factorial) ways, which is 2 * 1 = 2.\n**4. Calculate the total arrangements:**\nTo get the total number of arrangements where the boys sit together, multiply the arrangements of the units by the arrangements within the boy unit:\n5040 * 2 = **10080**\n**Therefore, there are 10,080 ways to arrange 6 girls and 2 boys in a row if the boys must sit next to each other.** \n",
