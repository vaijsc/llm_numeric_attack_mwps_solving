    "solution": "We can assume that the circle has its center at $(0,0)$ and a radius of $1$. Call the three points $A$, $B$, and $C$, and let $a$, $b$, and $c$ denote the length of the counterclockwise arc from $(1,0)$ to $A$, $B$, and $C$, respectively. Rotating the circle if necessary, we can also assume that $a= \\pi/3$. Since $b$ and $c$ are chosen at random from $[0, 2\\pi)$, the ordered pair $(b,c)$ is chosen at random from a square with area $4\\pi^2$ in the $bc$-plane. The condition of the problem is met if and only if \\[\n0<b<\\frac{2\\pi}{3}, \\quad 0<c<\\frac{2\\pi}{3},\n\\quad\\text{and}\\quad |b-c|<\\frac{\\pi}{3}.\n\\]This last inequality is equivalent to $b-\\dfrac{\\pi}{3}<c<b+\\frac{\\pi}{3}$.\n\n[asy]\nfill((0,0)--(0.33,0)--(0.66,0.33)--(0.66,0.66)--(0.33,0.66)--(0,0.33)--cycle,gray(0.7));\ndraw((0,0)--(2,0)--(2,2)--(0,2)--cycle,dashed);\ndraw((0,-0.33)--(1,0.66),dashed);\ndraw((-0.33,0)--(0.66,1),dashed);\ndraw((0.66,0)--(0.66,0.66)--(0,0.66),dashed);\ndraw((-0.5,0)--(2.5,0),Arrow);\ndraw((0,-0.5)--(0,2.5),Arrow);\nlabel(\"$c$\",(0,2.5),W);\nlabel(\"$b$\",(2.5,0),S);\nlabel(\"$\\frac{2}{3}\\pi$\",(0.66,0),S);\nlabel(\"$\\frac{2}{3}\\pi$\",(0,0.66),W);\nlabel(\"$2\\pi$\",(2,0),S);\nlabel(\"$2\\pi$\",(0,2),W);\n[/asy]\n\nThe graph of the common solution to these inequalities is the shaded region shown.

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Problem**\nImagine a circle.  We want to pick three points on the circle such that any two of them are closer to each other than the radius of the circle.\n**2. Key Insight:  Equilateral Triangle**\nThe limiting case for this problem is when the three points form an equilateral triangle inscribed in the circle.  If any of the points were to move further apart, at least one pairwise distance would exceed the radius.\n**3. Probability and Arcs**\n* **Choose the first point:**  It can be anywhere on the circle, so the probability is 1.\n* **Choose the second point:** This point must be within a semicircle (180 degrees) from the first point to ensure their distance is less than the radius. The probability of this is 1/2.\n* **Choose the third point:** The third point must be within the smaller arc of the circle that's less than 120 degrees (60 degrees on each side of the first two points) to maintain the equilateral triangle condition. The probability of this is (1/3).\n**4. Calculate the Overall Probability**\nThe overall probability is the product of these individual probabilities:\n1 * (1/2) * (1/3) = **1/6**\n**Therefore, the probability that all three pairwise distances between the points are less than the radius of the circle is 1/6.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Problem**\nImagine a circle.  We need to pick three points on this circle. We want to know the probability that these three points are all close enough together that any pair of them is less than the radius of the circle apart.\n**2. Consider the First Point**\n* The placement of the first point doesn't matter \u2013 it can be anywhere on the circle.\n**3.  The Second Point**\n* The second point must be within a semicircle of the first point to be less than a radius away.  Think of drawing a diameter through the first point \u2013 the second point must lie on one side of that diameter.  \n**4. The Third Point**\n* This is the crucial point. For all three pairwise distances to be less than the radius, the third point must lie within the smaller arc of the circle formed by the first two points.  Imagine drawing a chord connecting the first two points \u2013 the third point must fall within the arc of the circle that's on the same side of that chord as the first two points.\n**5. Calculate the Probability**\n* **Favorable Outcomes:** The third point can be anywhere within the smaller arc created by the first two points.\n* **Total Possible Outcomes:** The third point can be anywhere on the circle.\nSince the length of an arc is proportional to the central angle it subtends, the probability of the third point being within the favorable arc is:\n(Central angle of favorable arc) / (360 degrees)\n* **Finding the Central Angle:** Let the central angle of the favorable arc be `x`. The remaining part of the circle will have an angle of 360 - `x`. Since the first two points are less than a radius apart, the triangle formed by those two points and the center of the circle must be an acute triangle. Therefore, the angle between the first two points, which is 360 - `x`, must be less than 180 degrees. This means `x` must be greater than 180 degrees. \n* **Probability:** Since `x` is greater than 180 degrees, the probability is:\n  (Central angle of favorable arc) / (360 degrees) = `x` / 360 > 1/2\n**Conclusion**\nThe probability that all three pairwise distances between the randomly chosen points are less than the radius of the circle is greater than 1/2.\n**Important Note:** This doesn't give us the exact probability. To find the exact probability, we'd need to consider the specific location of the first two points and calculate the exact central angle of the favorable arc. \n",

We want to pick three points on the circle in such a way that the distance between any two of them is less than the radius of the circle.\n**2. Consider the First Two Points**\n*  Pick any two points on the circle.  They can be anywhere.\n**3. The Third Point's Location**\n* The third point must be within a semicircle defined by the first two points.  Why?  If the third point is outside this semicircle, the distance between it and at least one of the first two points will be greater than the radius.\n**4. Calculate the Probability**\n* The semicircle represents half the circumference of the circle. \n* The probability that the third point falls within this semicircle is **1/2**.\n**Therefore, the probability that all three pairwise distances between the points are less than the radius of the circle is 1/2.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step by step:\n**1. Visualize the Problem**\nImagine a circle.  We need to find the probability that if we pick three points at random on the circle, all three points are \"close\" enough to each other that any pair of them is less than one radius apart.\n**2. Focus on One Point**\nLet's fix one point on the circle. To satisfy the condition, the other two points must lie within a semicircle centered at our fixed point. \n**3.  Consider the Second Point**\n* The second point can be anywhere within that semicircle (probability of 1/2). \n**4.  The Critical Region for the Third Point**\n* The third point must be within an arc of the circle, centered at the second point, that has a radius of one radius of the original circle.  \n* **Key:** This arc will intersect the semicircle (centered at the first point) at two points. The third point must be located between these two points.\n**5. Calculate the Probability for the Third Point**\n* The arc length of this critical region for the third point is less than half the circumference of the original circle. \n* Since the points are chosen randomly and independently, the probability that the third point falls within this critical region is the ratio of the arc length of the critical region to the circumference of the circle. \n**6.  Finding the Arc Length**\n* Let the original circle have radius *R*. The arc length of the critical region is equal to twice the angle between the two points of intersection (let's call it \u03b8) multiplied by *R*.  \n* We can use the Law of Cosines to find \u03b8:  *R\u00b2 = R\u00b2 + R\u00b2 - 2(R)(R)cos(\u03b8)*. Solving for cos(\u03b8) gives us cos(\u03b8) = 1/2, so \u03b8 = 60\u00b0.\n* The arc length of the critical region is 2 * 60\u00b0 * R = 120\u00b0 * R.\n**7.  Final Calculation**\n* The probability that the third point lies within the critical region is (120\u00b0 * R) / (360\u00b0 * R) = 1/3.\n**8.  Putting it All Together**\nThe probability that all three points are less than one radius apart is:\n(1/2) * (1/3) = **1/6** \n**Therefore, the probability that all three pairwise distances between the points are less than the radius of the circle is 1/6.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Problem**\nImagine a circle.  We need to figure out when three randomly placed points on this circle will form a triangle where all sides are shorter than the radius.\n**2. Consider the \"Worst Case\" Scenario**\nThe most restrictive condition occurs when the three points are as far apart as possible while still satisfying the condition.  This happens when the points form an equilateral triangle inscribed in the circle.\n**3.  Equilateral Triangle**\n* An equilateral triangle inscribed in a circle has each side equal to the radius of the circle. \n*  Any three points on the circle forming a triangle with sides shorter than the radius must be closer together than the vertices of this inscribed equilateral triangle.\n**4.  Finding the Probability**\n* **Think of a \"Forbidden Zone\":**  Imagine a point is placed randomly on the circle.  If we want the other two points to form a triangle with sides less than the radius, they cannot lie within a 120-degree arc centered on the first point. \n* **Probability of Success:** For each point, there's a 120-degree arc where the next point *must* be placed to satisfy the condition.  The probability of this happening is (120 degrees / 360 degrees) = 1/3.\n* **Overall Probability:** Since we have three points, the overall probability is (1/3) * (1/3) * (1/3) = **1/27**.\n**Therefore, the probability that all three pairwise distances between the points are less than the radius of the circle is 1/27.** \n"
