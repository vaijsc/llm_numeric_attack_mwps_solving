    "solution": "This problem requires a little bit of casework.  There are four ways in which they can both get the same number: if they both get 1's, both get 2's, both get 3's or both get 4's. The probability of getting a 1 is $\\dfrac{1}{10}$, so the probability that they will both spin a 1 is $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{10}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{1}{100}$. Similarly, the probability of getting a 2 is $\\dfrac{2}{10}$, so the probability that they will both spin a 2 is $\\left(\\dfrac{2}{10}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{4}{100}$, the probability of getting a 3 is $\\dfrac{3}{10}$, so the probability that they will both get a 3 is $\\left(\\dfrac{3}{10}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{9}{100}$ and the probability of getting a 4 is $\\dfrac{4}{10}$, so the probability that they will both get a 4 is $\\left(\\dfrac{4}{10}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{16}{100}$. So our answer is $\\dfrac{1}{100}+\\dfrac{4}{100}+\\dfrac{9}{100}+\\dfrac{16}{100}=\\frac{30}{100}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{10}}$.",

Calculate the Probability of Each Favorable Outcome**\n* **Phil spins 1, Sarah spins 1:**  (1/10) * (1/10) = 1/100\n* **Phil spins 2, Sarah spins 2:** (2/10) * (2/10) = 4/100\n* **Phil spins 3, Sarah spins 3:** (3/10) * (3/10) = 9/100\n* **Phil spins 4, Sarah spins 4:** (4/10) * (4/10) = 16/100\n**4. Add the Probabilities of the Favorable Outcomes**\nThe total probability of them getting the same number is:\n1/100 + 4/100 + 9/100 + 16/100 = **30/100 = 3/10**\n**Therefore, the probability that Phil and Sarah get the same number is 3/10.** \n",
