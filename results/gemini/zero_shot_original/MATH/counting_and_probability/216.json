    "solution": "The probability of flipping exactly two heads and one tail is ${3 \\choose 2}\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^2 \\cdot \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{54}{125}$. The probability of flipping exactly three heads and no tails is $\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^3 = \\frac{27}{125}$. So these are the two cases for having more heads than tails, and their sum is $\\frac{54+27}{125} = \\boxed{\\frac{81}{125}}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Possible Outcomes:**\n* **HHH:** 3 Heads\n* **HHT:** 2 Heads, 1 Tail\n* **HTH:** 2 Heads, 1 Tail\n* **THH:** 2 Heads, 1 Tail\n* **HTT:** 1 Head, 2 Tails\n* **THT:** 1 Head, 2 Tails\n* **TTH:** 1 Head, 2 Tails\n* **TTT:** 3 Tails\n**2. Calculate Probabilities:**\n* **HHH:** (0.6)(0.6)(0.6) = 0.216\n* **HHT, HTH, THH:** Each has probability (0.6)(0.6)(0.4) = 0.144. Since there are three of these, the total probability is 3 * 0.144 = 0.432\n* **HTT, THT, TTH:** Each has probability (0.6)(0.4)(0.4) = 0.096.  Since there are three of these, the total probability is 3 * 0.096 = 0.288\n* **TTT:** (0.4)(0.4)(0.4) = 0.064\n**3. Determine Favorable Outcomes:**\nWe want more Heads than Tails. This occurs in the following outcomes:\n* **HHH**\n* **HHT**\n* **HTH**\n* **THH**\n**4. Calculate Total Probability of Favorable Outcomes:**\nThe probability of getting more Heads than Tails is 0.216 + 0.432 = **0.648**\n**5. Express as a Fraction:**\n0.648 is equivalent to  **648/1000**. This simplifies to **81/125**.\n**Therefore, the probability of flipping more Heads than Tails is 81/125.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Possible Outcomes**\nThere are 2 possible outcomes for each flip (Heads or Tails), and he flips the coin 3 times.
