Choosing the 8th-graders:**\n* There are 6 8th-graders to choose from.\n* We need to select three, so we use combinations:  \u2076C\u2083 = (6!)/(3!3!) = 20 ways.\n**3. Combining the Choices:**\n* To get the total number of ways to form the committee, we multiply the number of ways to choose each grade level: 4 ways * 20 ways = **80 ways**\n**Therefore, there are 80 ways to fill the committee.** \n",
