        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Find the perfect squares within the range:**\n* The smallest perfect square greater than or equal to 100 is 10\u00b2 = 100.\n* The largest perfect square less than or equal to 200 is 14\u00b2 = 196. \n**2. Count the perfect squares:**\n* There are 5 perfect squares between 100 and 200 (10\u00b2, 11\u00b2, 12\u00b2, 13\u00b2, 14\u00b2).\n**3. Calculate the non-perfect squares:**\n* There are 101 numbers between 100 and 200 (inclusive).\n* Subtract the number of perfect squares: 101 - 5 = 96\n**Answer:** There are **96** numbers between 100 and 200 (inclusive) that are not perfect squares. \n",

Calculate the Total Numbers:**\n* There are 101 numbers between 100 and 200 (inclusive).\n**4. Subtract the Perfect Squares:**\n* 101 (total numbers) - 5 (perfect squares) = 96\n**Therefore, there are 96 numbers between 100 and 200 (inclusive) that are not perfect squares.** \n",
