        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Question:**\nWe want to find the probability that the two dice show the *same* number.  This means the difference between the numbers is 0.\n**2. Determine the Possible Outcomes:**\n* Each die has 6 possible outcomes (numbers 1 through 6).\n* Since we're rolling two dice, there are 6 * 6 = 36 possible combinations.\n**3. Identify the Favorable Outcomes:**\n*  The favorable outcomes are the combinations where both dice show the same number: (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5), (6, 6).  There are 6 favorable outcomes.\n**4. Calculate the Probability:**\nProbability = (Favorable Outcomes) / (Total Possible Outcomes)\nProbability = 6 / 36 \n**5. Simplify the Fraction:**\nProbability = **1/6** \n**Therefore, the probability of rolling two dice and getting the same number (a difference of 0) is 1/6.** \n",
