        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n* **Person 1:** Shakes hands with 9 other people.\n* **Person 2:** Shakes hands with 8 other people (they've already shaken hands with person 1).\n* **Person 3:** Shakes hands with 7 other people. \n* **Person 4:** Shakes hands with 6 other people.\n* **Person 5:** Shakes hands with 5 other people.\n* **Person 6:** Shakes hands with 4 other people.\n* **Person 7:** Shakes hands with 3 other people.\n* **Person 8:** Shakes hands with 2 other people.\n* **Person 9:** Shakes hands with 1 other person.\n* **Person 10:** Has already shaken everyone's hand.\nNow, add up the number of handshakes: 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = **45**\n**Therefore, there are 45 handshakes at the party.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Step 1: The first person shakes hands with 9 other people.**\n**Step 2: The second person has already shaken hands with the first, so they shake hands with 8 new people.**\n**Step 3: The third person has already shaken hands with the first two, so they shake hands with 7 new people.**\n**Step 4:  This pattern continues until the last person has no new people to shake hands with.**\n**Step 5: To find the total number of handshakes, we add up the number of handshakes each person makes:** 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 45\n**However, this method counts each handshake twice (once for each person involved).**\n**Step 6:  Divide the sum by 2 to get the actual number of handshakes:** 45 / 2 = 22.5\n**Since you can't have half a handshake, we round down.**\n**Answer:** There are a total of **22** handshakes at the party. \n",
