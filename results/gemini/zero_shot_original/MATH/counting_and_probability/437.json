        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1.  Visualize the Problem**\nImagine 7 empty spots in a row representing the planting positions:\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _\n**2.  Choose Where to Plant the Apple Trees**\nWe need to choose 2 of these spots to plant the apple trees.  We can do this in  \u2087C\u2082 ways (7 choose 2), which is:\n\u2087C\u2082 = 7! / (2! * 5!) = 21 \n**3.  The Pear Trees are Automatically Arranged**\nOnce we've placed the apple trees, the pear trees automatically fill the remaining spots.  \n**4.  Total Arrangements**\nSince there are 21 ways to choose the spots for the apple trees, there are **21** distinct arrangements possible. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1.  Total Positions:**\n* You have 7 total spots in the row (2 apple trees + 5 pear trees).\n**2.  Choosing Apple Tree Positions:**\n* You need to choose 2 spots out of the 7 for the apple trees.  This is a combination problem, as the order you choose the spots doesn't matter.\n**3.  Calculating Combinations:**\n* The number of ways to choose 2 spots out of 7 is calculated using the combination formula:  \n   _n_C_r_ = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)  where n is the total number of items and r is the number you choose.\n* In this case, 7C2 = 7! / (2! * 5!) = (7 * 6) / (2 * 1) = 21\n**4.  Final Answer:**\n* There are **21** distinct arrangements possible. \n",

        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Total Spaces:**\n* We have 7 trees to plant (2 apple + 5 pear), so there are 7 spaces in the row.\n**2.

Consider the Choices**\n*  We need to choose 2 spaces for the apple trees.\n*  The remaining 5 spaces will automatically be filled with the pear trees.\n**3. Combinations**\n* We have 7 spaces to choose from for the first apple tree.\n* Once we've chosen the first apple tree, we have 6 spaces left for the second apple tree.\n* It might seem like we have 7 * 6 = 42 arrangements, but this counts each arrangement twice (placing apple tree 1 then 2 is the same as placing apple tree 2 then 1).\n* To correct for overcounting, we divide by 2.\n**4. Calculate the Arrangements**\nThe number of distinct arrangements is (7 * 6) / 2 = 21.\n**Answer:** There are 21 distinct arrangements possible. \n"
