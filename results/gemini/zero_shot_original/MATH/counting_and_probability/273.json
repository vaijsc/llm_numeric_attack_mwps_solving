    "solution": "When two dice are rolled, there are 36 total outcomes. Let's compute the probability that Allen wins. Allen wins if the product of the two numbers is even and not a multiple of 3. In other words, Allen wins if the product is 2 $(1\\cdot2, 2\\cdot1)$, 4 $(1\\cdot4, 4\\cdot1, 2\\cdot2)$, 8 $(2\\cdot4, 4\\cdot2)$, 10 $(2\\cdot5, 5\\cdot2)$, 16 $(4\\cdot4)$, or 20 $(4\\cdot5, 5\\cdot4)$. Therefore, the probability that Allen wins is $\\frac{2+3+2+2+1+2}{36}=12/36=1/3$. Then, the probability that Jean wins is $1-1/3=\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Understand the Winning Conditions:**\n* **Jean wins if the product is odd:**  This happens when both dice roll odd numbers.\n* **Jean wins if the product is a multiple of 3:**  This happens when at least one die rolls a 3 or a 6.\n**2. Calculate the Probability of Winning with an Odd Product:**\n*  The probability of rolling an odd number on one die is 3/6 = 1/2.\n*  The probability of rolling an odd number on both dice is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.\n**3. Calculate the Probability of Winning with a Multiple of 3:**\n*  There are 12 outcomes where at least one die shows a 3 or a 6 (you can list them out or use a table). \n*  There are 36 total possible outcomes when rolling two dice.\n*  The probability of winning with a multiple of 3 is 12/36 = 1/3.\n**4.  Consider Overlap:**\n*  Notice that some outcomes satisfy both conditions (like rolling a 3 and a 5). To avoid double-counting, we need to figure out the probability of these overlapping outcomes.\n*  There are 2 outcomes where both dice are odd and at least one is a 3 (3, 3) and (3, 5), and the same two outcomes when both dice are odd and at least one is a 6 (6, 3) and (6, 5). So there are 4 outcomes that fit both conditions.\n*  The probability of getting an outcome that satisfies both conditions is 4/36 = 1/9.\n**5.  Calculate the Total Probability of Jean Winning:**\n*  Probability (Jean wins) = Probability (odd product) + Probability (multiple of 3) - Probability (both)\n*  Probability (Jean wins) = (1/4) + (1/3) - (1/9) = 7/12\n**Therefore, the probability that Jean wins is 7/12.** \n",
        "Here's how to break down the problem to find the probability Jean wins:\n**1.  Understanding the Winning Conditions:**\n* **Odd Product:**  An odd product occurs only when both dice rolls are odd numbers.\n* **Multiple of Three:** A product is a multiple of three if at least one of the dice rolls is a 3 or a 6.\n**2.  Finding the Total Possible Outcomes:**\n*  Each die has six sides, so there are 6 * 6 = 36 possible outcomes when rolling two dice.\n**3.  Calculating Winning Outcomes:**\n* **Odd Product:** There are 3 odd numbers on each die (1, 3, and 5), so there are 3 * 3 = 9 ways to get an odd product.\n* **Multiple of Three (but not odd):**  \n    *  There are 2 ways to get a 3 on each die (1, 3) and (3, 1). \n    *  Similarly, there are 2 ways to get a 6 on each die.\n    *  There are 4 ways to get a 3 and a 6 (1, 6), (6, 1), (3, 6), and (6, 3).\n    *  In total, there are 2 + 2 + 4 = 8 ways to get a multiple of three that isn't already an odd product.\n**4.  Calculating the Probability:**\n* **Total Winning Outcomes:** 9 (odd product) + 8 (multiple of three) = 17\n* **Probability:** (Favorable Outcomes) / (Total Outcomes) = 17/36\n**Therefore, the probability that Jean wins is 17/36.** \n",

Understand Winning Conditions**\n* **Jean wins:**  The product of the dice is odd OR a multiple of 3.\n* **Allen wins:** The product of the dice is even AND NOT a multiple of 3.\n**2. Analyze the Possibilities**\n* **Odd Product:** To get an odd product, both dice must be odd numbers. There are 3 odd numbers on each die (1, 3, 5).\n* **Multiple of 3:** To get a multiple of 3, at least one of the dice must be a 3. \n**3. Count Favorable Outcomes**\n* **Odd Products:** There are 3 odd numbers on each die, so there are 3 * 3 = 9 ways to get an odd product.\n* **Multiples of 3:**  There are 6 possible outcomes for each die.  We need to count the cases where at least one die is a 3.  \n    * There are 5 outcomes where the first die is a 3 (3-1, 3-2, 3-3, 3-4, 3-5, 3-6).\n    * Similarly, there are 5 outcomes where the second die is a 3. \n    * However, we've double-counted the case (3, 3), so we subtract 1.\n    * Total favorable outcomes for multiples of 3: 5 + 5 - 1 = 9\n**4. Count Total Outcomes**\n* Each die has 6 sides, so there are 6 * 6 = 36 total possible outcomes.\n**5. Calculate Probability**\n* **Favorable Outcomes:** 9 (odd products) + 9 (multiples of 3) = 18\n* **Probability:** 18/36 = **1/2**\n**Therefore, the probability that Jean wins is 1/2.** \n",
