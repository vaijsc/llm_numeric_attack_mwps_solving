    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are six ways in which one European country can be chosen, four in which one Asian country can be chosen, three in which one North American country can be chosen, and seven in which one African country can be chosen. Thus, there are $6 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7 = \\boxed{504}$ ways to form the international commission.",
