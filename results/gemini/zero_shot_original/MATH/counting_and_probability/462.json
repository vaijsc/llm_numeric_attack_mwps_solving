    "solution": "To have 9 as a factor, $n!$ must have two factors of 3.  The first such $n$ for which this is true is 6, since  $6! = \\textbf{6} \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times \\textbf{3} \\times 2 \\times 1$.  Since 9 is a factor of $6!$ and $6!$ is a factor of $n!$ for all $n \\ge 6$, the numbers $6!, 7!, 8!, \\ldots, 99!, 100!$ are all divisible by 9.  There are $100 - 6 + 1 = \\boxed{95}$ numbers in that list.",

        "Here's how to figure out how many factorials from 1! to 100! are divisible by 9:\n**Understanding Divisibility by 9**\n* A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.\n* Factorials (like 5! = 5*4*3*2*1) involve multiplying a sequence of consecutive numbers.\n**Thinking Step by Step**\n1. **Factorials containing 9:**  Any factorial greater than or equal to 9! will contain a 9 as a factor. Since 9 is divisible by 9, these factorials will also be divisible by 9.\n2. **Factorials containing multiples of 9:**  Factorials greater than or equal to 18! will contain both a 9 and an 18 (which is a multiple of 9), making them divisible by 9.  Similarly, factorials greater than or equal to 27!, 36!, and so on, will be divisible by 9.\n3. **The Pattern:** Notice that every factorial starting from 9! onwards will be divisible by 9. This pattern continues for all factorials up to 100!.\n**Answer:**\nTherefore, there are **92** factorials from 1! to 100! that are divisible by 9 (from 9! to 100!). \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding Factorials and Divisibility**\n* **Factorial:** The factorial of a non-negative integer *n*, denoted by *n*!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to *n*. For example, 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.\n* **Divisibility by 9:**  A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.\n**Finding the Pattern**\n* **Factorials and 9:** Notice that factorials will often contain multiples of 9.  \n* **Multiples of 9:**  Every number that is a multiple of 9 will contribute a factor of 9 to the factorial.\n**Finding the Factorials Divisible by 9**\n1. **1! to 8!:** None of these factorials are divisible by 9.\n2. **9!:**  9! = 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1, which contains a factor of 9, making it divisible by 9.\n3. **10! to 18!:**  Each of these factorials will contain a factor of 9 (from the 9 in the factorial).  Since the sum of the digits of each of these factorials will be divisible by 9 (they contain a '9'), these factorials are also divisible by 9.\n4. **19! to 27!:** Similar to the previous step, all of these factorials will be divisible by 9.\n5. **Continue the Pattern:**  This pattern continues. For every set of 9 consecutive factorials, starting from a number divisible by 9, all the factorials in that set will be divisible by 9.\n**Solution**\n* We have 100 factorials to consider (1! to 100!).\n* There are 11 groups of 9 consecutive factorials (9 groups of 9 consecutive factorials from 9! to 99!, plus 1 group of 1 factorial from 100!).\n* Within each group of 9 consecutive factorials, all factorials are divisible by 9.\n* Therefore, there are **11** factorials between 1! and 100! that are divisible by 9. \n",
