However, this procedure double-counts the assignments that make one team all girls and another all boys. There are 3 choices for the girls team and then 2 choices for the boys team, and $\\binom64^2=225$ ways to choose the teams, for a total of $2\\cdot3\\cdot225=1350$ double-counted arrangements, leaving $6300-1350=4950$ ways to make a team all girls or all boys.

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Divide the students into groups:**\n* **Team 1:** We need at least one girl and one boy.  Let's choose one girl (6 options) and one boy (6 options). This gives us 6 * 6 = 36 ways to form the core of Team 1.\n* **Team 2:** Now we have 5 girls and 5 boys left. We again need one of each. We have 5 * 5 = 25 ways to form the core of Team 2.\n* **Team 3:**  We're left with 4 girls and 4 boys.  There are 4 * 4 = 16 ways to form the core of Team 3.\n**2. Assign remaining students:**\n* For each team, we have 2 remaining spots to fill.  We can choose any of the remaining students for these spots.  Since the jersey colors are indistinguishable, the order we choose the remaining students doesn't matter.  Let's think about the possibilities:\n    * Team 1: We have 8 students left, and we need to choose 2.  This is a combination problem: 8C2 = (8 * 7)/(2 * 1) = 28 ways.\n    * Team 2: We have 6 students left, and we need to choose 2: 6C2 = (6 * 5)/(2 * 1) = 15 ways.\n    * Team 3: We have 4 students left, and we need to choose 2: 4C2 = (4 * 3)/(2 * 1) = 6 ways.\n**3. Multiply the possibilities:**\nTo find the total number of ways to assign the jerseys, we multiply the possibilities for each step:\n36 ways (Team 1 core) * 25 ways (Team 2 core) * 16 ways (Team 3 core) * 28 ways (Team 1 remaining) * 15 ways (Team 2 remaining) * 6 ways (Team 3 remaining) = **756,000 ways**\n**Therefore, there are 756,000 ways the coach can give out the jerseys while ensuring each team has at least one girl and one boy.** \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Assign Teams:**\n* We need to divide the 12 students into 3 teams with 4 students each.  \n**2.  Ensure at least one girl and one boy on each team:**\n* Since there are 6 girls and 6 boys, the simplest way to guarantee this is to pre-assign one girl and one boy to each team.\n**3.  Remaining Students:**\n* This leaves us with 4 girls and 4 boys who still need to be assigned to teams.\n**4.  Distributing the Remaining Students:**\n* We now have 4 slots on each team to fill.  Let's think about the choices for the remaining students:\n    * **Team 1:**  We have 8 students left (4 girls and 4 boys) and need to fill 4 slots.  We can choose 4 students out of 8, which can be done in \u2078C\u2084 ways (8 choose 4), or 70 ways.\n    * **Team 2:** Now we have 4 students left, and we need to fill 4 slots.  This can be done in \u2074C\u2084 ways (4 choose 4), or 1 way. \n    * **Team 3:**  There's only one way to fill the remaining slots with the last 4 students.\n**5.  Coloring the Teams:**\n* We have 3 colors for the jerseys, and since the jerseys of the same color are indistinguishable, there are 3! (3 factorial) or 6 ways to assign the colors to the teams.\n**6.  Putting it all Together:**\n* The total number of ways to distribute the jerseys is:  (\u2078C\u2084) * (\u2074C\u2084) * 3! = 70 * 1 * 6 = **420**\n**Therefore, there are 420 ways the coach can give out the jerseys while ensuring at least one girl and one boy on each team.** \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Divide into Groups:**\n* The coach needs to divide the 12 students into 3 teams of 4 each.\n**2.  Minimum Requirements:**\n* Each team must have at least one girl and one boy.\n**3.  Filling Teams:**\n* **Step 1:** Place one girl and one boy on each team. This leaves us with 4 girls and 4 boys. \n* **Step 2:** Now we have 4 remaining students (2 girls and 2 boys) to fill the remaining spots on the teams.\n**4.  Choosing the Remaining Students:**\n* We need to choose 2 more students for each team. Since the teams are indistinguishable (jersey color doesn't matter), we can treat this as a combination problem. \n**5.  Calculate Combinations:**\n* The number of ways to choose 2 students from 4 is given by the combination formula:  \u2074C\u2082 = 4! / (2! * 2!) = 6.\n**6.  Final Calculation:**\n* Since we have 3 teams, and each team has 6 ways to choose its remaining two students, the total number of ways the coach can give out the jerseys is 6 * 6 * 6 = **216**.\n**Therefore, there are 216 ways the coach can give out the jerseys while ensuring at least one girl and one boy on each team.** \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Divide the students into groups:**\n* We need to divide the 12 students into 3 teams of 4 each, ensuring at least one girl and one boy on each team. \n**2.  Focus on the girls:**\n* We can choose 1 girl for the first team in 6 ways.\n* After choosing one girl for the first team, we have 5 girls left.  We can choose 1 of these for the second team in 5 ways.\n* For the third team, there's only 1 girl left.\n**3.  Focus on the boys:**\n* We can choose 1 boy for the first team in 6 ways.\n* For the second team, we can choose 1 boy out of the remaining 5 in 5 ways.\n* For the third team, there's only 1 boy left.\n**4.  Consider the order of the teams:**\n* We've chosen the girls and boys for each team, but the order of the teams doesn't matter. For example, picking Team A, Team B, and Team C is the same as Team C, Team A, and Team B. So we need to divide by the number of ways to order 3 teams, which is 3! (3 factorial) = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6.\n**5.  Calculate the total number of ways:**\n* The total number of ways to give out jerseys is: \n    * (6 * 5 * 1) * (6 * 5 * 1) / 6 \n    * = 180 / 6\n    * = 30\n**Therefore, there are 30 ways the coach can give out the jerseys, ensuring at least one girl and one boy on each team.** \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Forming Teams with Gender Restrictions:**\n* **Choose a team:**  The coach needs to select 4 students to form a team. Since there must be at least one girl and one boy, the possibilities are:\n    * 3 girls, 1 boy \n    * 2 girls, 2 boys\n    * 1 girl, 3 boys\n**2.  Calculate the Number of Ways to Choose Each Team Type:**\n* **3 girls, 1 boy:**\n    * Choose 3 girls from 6:  \u2076C\u2083 = 20 ways\n    * Choose 1 boy from 6: \u2076C\u2081 = 6 ways\n    * Total ways to form this type of team: 20 * 6 = 120 ways\n* **2 girls, 2 boys:**\n    * Choose 2 girls from 6: \u2076C\u2082 = 15 ways\n    * Choose 2 boys from 6: \u2076C\u2082 = 15 ways\n    * Total ways to form this type of team: 15 * 15 = 225 ways\n* **1 girl, 3 boys:**\n    * Choose 1 girl from 6: \u2076C\u2081 = 6 ways\n    * Choose 3 boys from 6: \u2076C\u2083 = 20 ways\n    * Total ways to form this type of team: 6 * 20 = 120 ways\n**3.  Assign Jersey Colors to Teams:**\n* Since the coach has 3 colors of jerseys, and he needs to assign one color to each team, there are 3! (3 factorial) ways to do this: 3 * 2 * 1 = 6 ways\n**4.  Total Number of Ways:**\n* **For each team type, multiply the number of ways to form the team by the number of ways to assign jersey colors:**\n    * 3 girls, 1 boy: 120 ways * 6 ways = 720 ways\n    * 2 girls, 2 boys: 225 ways * 6 ways = 1350 ways\n    * 1 girl, 3 boys: 120 ways * 6 ways = 720 ways\n* **Add the results for all team types:** 720 + 1350 + 720 = **2790 ways**\n**Therefore, there are 2790 ways the coach can give out the jerseys while ensuring at least one girl and one boy on each team.** \n"
