        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1.  Possible Outcomes:**\n* Each die has 6 sides (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).\n* With three dice, there are 6 x 6 x 6 = 216 possible combinations.\n**2.  Unfavorable Outcomes:**\n* The only way to get a sum less than 3 is by rolling three 1s. There's only one way to do this.\n**3.  Favorable Outcomes:**\n*  Any combination other than three 1s will result in a sum of 3 or more.  This means there are 216 - 1 = 215 favorable outcomes.\n**4.  Calculate the Probability:**\n* Probability = (Favorable Outcomes) / (Total Possible Outcomes) \n* Probability = 215 / 216\n**5.  Convert to a Percentage:**\n* (215 / 216) * 100% \u2248 **99.5%** \n**Therefore, the probability of Tara rolling a sum of three or more is approximately 99.5%.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Total Possible Outcomes:**\n* Each die has 6 sides (1-6).\n* With three dice, there are 6 * 6 * 6 = 216 possible combinations.\n**2. Unfavorable Outcomes (Sum less than 3):**\n* The only way to get a sum less than 3 is to roll all 1s. \n**3. Favorable Outcomes (Sum of 3 or more):**\n*  Subtract the unfavorable outcomes from the total outcomes: 216 - 1 = 215\n**4.
