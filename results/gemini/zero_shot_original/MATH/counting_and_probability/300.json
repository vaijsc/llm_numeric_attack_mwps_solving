    "solution": "There are $8\\cdot 8 = 64$ ordered pairs that can represent the top numbers on the two dice. Let $m$ and $n$ represent the top numbers on the dice.  Then $mn > m+n$ implies that $mn - m - n >\n0$, that is, $$1 < mn - m - n + 1 = (m-1)(n-1).$$This inequality is satisfied except when $m=1$, $n=1$, or when $m=n=2$. There are 16 ordered pairs $(m,n)$ excluded by these conditions, so the probability that the product is greater than the sum is \\[\n\\frac{64-16}{64} = \\frac{48}{64} = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}}.\n\\]",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Count the Total Possibilities**\n* Each die has 8 possible outcomes.\n* Since we're rolling two dice, the total number of possible outcomes is 8 * 8 = 64.\n**2. Analyze the Condition**\nWe want the product of the two numbers to be greater than their sum.  Let's think about the types of numbers that satisfy this:\n* **Larger Numbers:**  If both numbers are large (e.g., 6 and 7), the product will always be greater than the sum. \n* **Smaller Numbers:** If one or both numbers are small, the product might be less than or equal to the sum.  \n**3.  Find the Cases Where the Product is NOT Greater than the Sum**\nIt's easier to count the cases where the product is *not* greater than the sum, and then subtract from the total possibilities.  Here's how to find those cases:\n* **Both Numbers are 1:** (1, 1)\n* **One Number is 1, the other is 2 or 3:** (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1)\n* **Both Numbers are 2:** (2, 2)\n* **One Number is 2, the other is 3:** (2, 3), (3, 2)\n* **One Number is 3, the other is 4:** (3, 4), (4, 3)\n**4.  Calculate the Probability**\n* There are 10 cases where the product is not greater than the sum.\n* There are 64 total possible outcomes.\n* Therefore, there are 64 - 10 = 54 cases where the product *is* greater than the sum.\n* The probability is 54/64, which simplifies to **27/32**. \n",

Total Possibilities**\n* Each die has 8 possible outcomes.\n* Since we're rolling two dice, there are 8 * 8 = 64 total possible outcomes.\n**2.  Finding Favorable Outcomes**\nWe need to find the pairs of numbers where the product is greater than the sum.  Let's analyze the possible cases:\n* **Case 1:  One die shows 1.**  The product will always be less than or equal to the sum.\n* **Case 2: One die shows 2.**  The only successful case is if the other die shows 3 or higher (product > sum).\n* **Case 3: One die shows 3.** Successful if the other die shows 4 or higher.\n* **Case 4: One die shows 4.** Successful if the other die shows 5 or higher.\n* **Case 5: One die shows 5.** Successful if the other die shows 6 or higher.\n* **Case 6: One die shows 6.** Successful if the other die shows 7 or higher.\n* **Case 7: One die shows 7.** Successful if the other die shows 8. \n* **Case 8: One die shows 8.** All possibilities with the other die are successful.\n**3. Counting Successful Outcomes**\nWe've determined the successful cases for each possible outcome of one die.  Now, let's count them:\n* Case 2: 6 successful outcomes (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)\n* Case 3: 5 successful outcomes (4, 5, 6, 7, 8)\n* Case 4: 4 successful outcomes (5, 6, 7, 8)\n* Case 5: 3 successful outcomes (6, 7, 8)\n* Case 6: 2 successful outcomes (7, 8)\n* Case 7: 1 successful outcome (8)\n* Case 8: 8 successful outcomes\nTotal successful outcomes: 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 8 = 29\n**4. Calculating Probability**\n* Probability = (Favorable Outcomes) / (Total Possible Outcomes)\n* Probability = 29 / 64\n**Therefore, the probability that the product of the two top numbers is greater than their sum is 29/64.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Calculate the total possible outcomes:**\n* Each die has 8 possible outcomes.\n* Since we're rolling two dice, the total number of possible outcomes is 8 * 8 = 64.\n**2.  Find the favorable outcomes:**\n* We need to find pairs of numbers where the product is greater than the sum. Let's systematically analyze possibilities:\n    * **If the first die is 1:** No number on the second die will result in a product greater than the sum.\n    * **If the first die is 2:** Only the numbers 5, 6, 7, and 8 on the second die will satisfy the condition.\n    * **If the first die is 3:** The numbers 5, 6, 7, and 8 on the second die work.\n    * **If the first die is 4:** The numbers 5, 6, 7, and 8 on the second die work.\n    * **If the first die is 5:** The numbers 6, 7, and 8 on the second die work.\n    * **If the first die is 6:** The numbers 7 and 8 on the second die work.\n    * **If the first die is 7:** The number 8 on the second die works.\n    * **If the first die is 8:** No number on the second die will result in a product greater than the sum.\n* Counting the favorable outcomes, we have 4 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 18.\n**3. Calculate the probability:**\n* Probability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n* Probability = 18/64 = **9/32**\n**Therefore, the probability that the product of the two top numbers is greater than their sum is 9/32.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Understanding the Problem**\nWe need to find the probability that the product of the two numbers rolled is greater than their sum.  Let's represent the two numbers as *x* and *y*.  We want to find the probability that  *xy* > *x + y*.\n**2.  Analyzing the Possibilities**\nIt's easier to figure out the cases where the product is *not* greater than the sum, and then subtract that probability from 1.  This means we want to find the cases where *xy* \u2264 *x + y*.\n**3.  Simplifying the Inequality**\nLet's rearrange the inequality *xy* \u2264 *x + y* to make it easier to work with:\n*xy - x - y \u2264 0*\n*xy - x - y + 1 \u2264 1*\n*(x - 1)(y - 1) \u2264 1*\n**4.  Finding Solutions**\nNow we need to find the pairs of numbers (x, y) where (x - 1)(y - 1) \u2264 1. Since *x* and *y* are between 1 and 8, we can consider the possible values:\n* **If x = 1:**  Any value of y will work.\n* **If y = 1:** Any value of x will work.\n* **If x = 2:**  y can be 1 or 2.\n* **If x = 3:** y can be 1 or 2.\n* **If x = 4:** y can be 1 or 2.\n* **If x = 5:** y can be 1 or 2.\n* **If x = 6:** y can be 1 or 2.\n* **If x = 7:** y can be 1 or 2.\n* **If x = 8:** y can be 1 or 2.\n**5.  Counting Favorable Outcomes**\nThere are 8 + 8 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 28 pairs that satisfy the inequality *xy* \u2264 *x + y*.\n**6.  Calculating the Probability**\n* There are 8 x 8 = 64 total possible outcomes when rolling two eight-sided dice.\n* The probability of the product being less than or equal to the sum is 28/64 = 7/16.\n* Therefore, the probability of the product being *greater* than the sum is 1 - 7/16 = **9/16**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Possible Outcomes**\n* Since we have two eight-sided dice, there are 8 x 8 = 64 possible outcomes.\n**2.  Favorable Outcomes**\n* We need to find the combinations where the product is greater than the sum. We can do this systematically:\n   * **If the first die shows a 1:** There are no possible outcomes where the product is greater than the sum.\n   * **If the first die shows a 2:**  The only way the product will be greater than the sum is if the second die shows a 3 or higher (2 x 3 > 2 + 3,  2 x 4 > 2 + 4, etc.)\n   * **If the first die shows a 3:** The second die needs to be at least a 4 (3 x 4 > 3 + 4, etc.).\n   * **If the first die shows a 4:** The second die needs to be at least a 3 (4 x 3 > 4 + 3, etc.).\n   * **If the first die shows a 5 or higher:** The product will always be greater than the sum.\n**3.

Probability**\nThe probability of the product being greater than the sum is:\n(Favorable outcomes) / (Total possible outcomes) = 42/64 = **21/32** \n"
