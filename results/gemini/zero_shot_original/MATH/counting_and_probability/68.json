        "Here's how to determine the number of ways to arrange the letters of the word ELEVEN:\n**1. Total Letters:**\n* The word ELEVEN has 6 letters.\n**2. Repeated Letters:**\n* The letter 'E' appears 3 times.\n* The letter 'L' appears 2 times.\n**3. The Formula:**\nTo handle the repeated letters, we use the following formula:\n* **Total arrangements = (Total number of letters)! / (Repetitions of letter 1)! * (Repetitions of letter 2)! * ...**\n**4. Applying the Formula:**\n* Total arrangements = 6! / (3! * 2!)\n* Total arrangements = (6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((3 * 2 * 1) * (2 * 1))\n* Total arrangements = 720 / (6 * 2)\n* Total arrangements = 720 / 12\n* Total arrangements = 60\n**Therefore, there are 60 different ways to arrange the letters of the word ELEVEN.** \n",
        "Here's how to determine the number of ways to arrange the letters of the word ELEVEN:\n**1. Count the letters:**\n* There are 6 letters in total.\n**2. Identify repeated letters:**\n* The letter 'E' appears 3 times.\n* The letter 'L' appears 2 times.\n**3. Apply the formula:**\nThe number of arrangements (permutations) with repetitions is calculated using the following formula:\n```\nTotal arrangements = (Total number of letters)! / (Repetitions of letter 1)! * (Repetitions of letter 2)! * ...\n```\n**4. Calculate:**\nIn this case, the formula becomes:\n```\nArrangements = 6! / (3! * 2!)\n```\n**5. Simplify:**\n```\nArrangements = (6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((3 * 2 * 1) * (2 * 1))\n```\n```\nArrangements = 720 / (6 * 2)\n```\n```\nArrangements = 720 / 12\n```\n```\nArrangements = 60\n```\n**Therefore, there are 60 ways to arrange the letters of the word ELEVEN.** \n",

Identify repeated letters:**\n* The letter 'E' appears 3 times.\n* The letter 'L' appears 2 times.\n**3. Apply the formula:**\nThe number of ways to arrange *n* objects, where *r* objects are identical of one type, *s* objects are identical of another type, and so on, is:\nn! / (r! * s! * ...)\n**4. Calculate:**\nIn this case, we have:\n* n = 6 (total letters)\n* r = 3 (number of 'E's)\n* s = 2 (number of 'L's)\nTherefore, the number of arrangements is:\n6! / (3! * 2!) = (6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((3 * 2 * 1) * (2 * 1)) = 720 / (6 * 2) = 720 / 12 = 60\n**Answer:** There are 60 ways to arrange the letters of the word ELEVEN. \n",

Count the Letters:**\n* There are 6 letters in total.\n*  'E' appears 3 times\n*  'L' appears 2 times\n*  'V' appears 1 time\n**2. Calculate the Total Possible Arrangements (Ignoring Repetition):**\nIf all the letters were unique, we'd have 6! (6 factorial) ways to arrange them: 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720\n**3. Account for Repetitions:**\nSince we have repeated letters, we need to divide the total arrangements by the factorials of the number of times each letter repeats:\n* **E:**  3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6\n* **L:** 2! = 2 * 1 = 2\n**4.
