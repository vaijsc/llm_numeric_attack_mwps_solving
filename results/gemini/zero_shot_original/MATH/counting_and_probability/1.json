    "solution": "For $n$ dice, there are $\\binom{n}{2}=\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ ways to choose two of them. For each of these ways, there is a $\\left( \\frac{5}{6} \\right)^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{6} \\right)^{n-2}$ chance that all but the chosen two dice will roll a 1. Therefore, we need to find the value of $n$ for which $\\frac{25n(n-1)}{2 \\cdot 6^n}=\\frac{25}{216}$, or $108n(n-1)=6^n$. Plugging in values for $n$, we can see that $n=\\boxed{4}$ works and no value of $n$ less than 4 works. Now we just need to prove that no values of $n$ greater than 4 work. Note that if $n \\geq 5$, then $n < 3^{n-3}$ and $n-1 < 2\\cdot 2^{n-3}$. We can multiply these inequalities to get that when $n \\geq 5$, we have $n(n-1) < 2\\cdot 6^{n-3}$, or $108n(n-1)<6^n$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Probability of a single die not showing a 1:**\n* There are 5 outcomes where a die doesn't show a 1 (2, 3, 4, 5, 6).\n* There are 6 total possible outcomes.\n* Probability of a single die not showing a 1 is 5/6.\n**2. Probability of two dice not showing a 1:**\n* The probability of the first die not showing a 1 is 5/6.\n* The probability of the second die not showing a 1 is also 5/6.\n* Since these events are independent, we multiply the probabilities: (5/6) * (5/6) = 25/36\n**3. Probability of the rest of the dice showing a 1:**\n* For the remaining (n-2) dice, we need them to show a 1.\n* The probability of a single die showing a 1 is 1/6.\n* The probability of (n-2) dice showing a 1 is (1/6)^(n-2)\n**4. Combining the probabilities:**\n* The probability of exactly two dice not showing a 1 and the rest showing a 1 is:\n   (25/36) * (1/6)^(n-2)\n**5. Setting up the equation:**\n* We are given that this probability is 25/216:\n   (25/36) * (1/6)^(n-2) = 25/216\n**6. Solving for n:**\n* Simplify the equation: (1/6)^(n-2) = 1/6\n* We see that n-2 must equal 1.\n* Therefore, n = **3**. \n**Answer:**  There are **3** dice. \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Probability of a single die not showing a 1:**\n* A standard die has 6 sides.\n* There are 5 sides that are not a 1.\n* The probability of a single die not showing a 1 is 5/6.\n**2. Probability of two dice not showing a 1, and the rest showing a 1:**\n* The probability of two specific dice not showing a 1 is (5/6) * (5/6) = 25/36.\n* The probability of the remaining (n-2) dice showing a 1 is (1/6)^(n-2).\n**3.  Choosing the two dice that don't show a 1:**\n* We need to choose 2 dice out of n. This can be done in  \"n choose 2\" ways, which is denoted by  n!/(2!(n-2)!).\n**4.  Putting it all together:**\nThe probability of exactly two dice not showing a 1 is the product of the probabilities from steps 2 and 3:\n[n!/(2!(n-2)!)] * (25/36) * (1/6)^(n-2) = 25/216\n**5. Simplifying and solving for n:**\n* Cancel out the common factor of 25: [n!/(2!(n-2)!)] * (1/36) * (1/6)^(n-2) = 1/216\n* Simplify the factorial terms: n(n-1)/2 * (1/36) * (1/6)^(n-2) = 1/216\n* Multiply both sides by 72: n(n-1) * (1/6)^(n-2) = 4\n* We can try substituting different values of n to see if they satisfy the equation.  \n* For n = 4, we get: 4 * 3 * (1/6)^2 = 4 * 3 / 36 = 1/3.  This is not equal to 4.\n* For n = 5, we get: 5 * 4 * (1/6)^3 = 5 * 4 / 216 = 5/54. This is not equal to 4.\n* For n = 6, we get: 6 * 5 * (1/6)^4 = 6 * 5 / 1296 = 5/216. This is not equal to 4.\n* For n = 7, we get: 7 * 6 * (1/6)^5 = 7 * 6 / 7776 = 7/1296. This is not equal to 4.\n* For n = 8, we get: 8 * 7 * (1/6)^6 = 8 * 7 / 46656 = 7/5832. This is not equal to 4.\n* For n = 9, we get: 9 * 8 * (1/6)^7 = 9 * 8 / 279936 = 2/3280. This is not equal to 4.\n* For n = 10, we get: 10 * 9 * (1/6)^8 = 10 * 9 / 1679616 = 3/559872. This is not equal to 4.\n**6. Conclusion:**\nWe can see that none of the values of n from 4 to 10 satisfy the equation.  It seems like there might be an error in the problem statement or the given probability. There's no integer value for 'n' that would make the given probability work. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Probability:**\n* The probability of getting a number other than 1 on a single die is 5/6.\n* The probability of getting a 1 on a single die is 1/6.\n**2. Set up the Equation:**\n* We want exactly two dice to show a number other than 1.  This means the rest of the dice must show a 1. \n* Let's use the following notation:\n    *  *P(event)* represents the probability of the event happening.\n    * *n* represents the total number of dice.\nThe probability of this event can be expressed as:\n*P(exactly two dice show a number other than 1)* = *P(two dice show other than 1) * *P(remaining dice show 1)*\n**3. Break Down the Probability:**\n* **P(two dice show other than 1):**\n    * The probability of one die showing other than 1 is 5/6.\n    * We need this to happen twice, so we multiply the probability by itself: (5/6) * (5/6) = 25/36\n    * Since the dice are rolled simultaneously, we need to consider all the possible ways to choose 2 dice out of *n*. This is a combination, denoted as \"n choose 2\" or  nCr(n,2) = n! / (2! * (n-2)!).\n* **P(remaining dice show 1):**\n    * If *n* is the total number of dice, and 2 are showing other than 1, then *n-2* dice must show 1.\n    * The probability of one die showing a 1 is 1/6. \n    * We need this to happen *n-2* times, so we multiply (1/6) by itself *n-2* times: (1/6)^(n-2)\n**4. Combine the Probabilities:**\nNow we can put everything together:\n*P(exactly two dice show a number other than 1)* = nCr(n, 2) * (25/36) * (1/6)^(n-2)\n**5. Use the Given Information:**\nWe are given that this probability is 25/216:\nnCr(n, 2) * (25/36) * (1/6)^(n-2) = 25/216\n**6. Solve for *n***\n* Simplify the equation:\n  n! / (2! * (n-2)!) * (25/36) * (1/6)^(n-2) = 25/216\n* Divide both sides by 25/36:\n  n! / (2! * (n-2)!) * (1/6)^(n-2) = 1/6\n* Simplify:\n  n! / (2! * (n-2)!) * (1/6)^(n-2) = (1/6)^1\n* This tells us that n-2 = 1 \n* Solve for n: \n   n = 3\n**Therefore, there are 3 dice.** \n",

Probability of a Single Die**\n* The probability of a single die *not* showing a 1 is 5/6 (since there are 5 favorable outcomes: 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6).\n* The probability of a single die *showing* a 1 is 1/6.\n**2.  Set up the Equation**\n* We want exactly two dice to show a number other than 1, and the rest to show a 1.\n* This can be represented using combinations:  The number of ways to choose 2 dice out of *n* is  \"n choose 2\", denoted as  n!/(2!(n-2)!).\n* The probability of a specific combination (e.g., the first two dice showing other than 1, and the rest showing 1) is (5/6)^2 * (1/6)^(n-2) \n*  Putting it all together: \n   (n!/(2!(n-2)!)) * (5/6)^2 * (1/6)^(n-2) = 25/216\n**3.

Since the right side is 2, we can try small values of 'n' and see if they work.\n**4.  Find the Solution**\n*  Let's try a few values of 'n':\n    * If n = 3: 3(2) * (1/6)^3 = 1/18 (not equal to 2)\n    * If n = 4: 4(3) * (1/6)^4 = 1/36 (not equal to 2)\n    * If n = 5: 5(4) * (1/6)^5 = 5/648 (not equal to 2)\n    * If n = 6: 6(5) * (1/6)^6 = 5/3888 (not equal to 2) \n    * **If n = 7: 7(6) * (1/6)^7 = 2**\n**Therefore, n = 7.** \n",

Probability of Two Dice Not Showing a 1**\n*  The probability of two specific dice not showing a 1 is (5/6) * (5/6) = 25/36.\n**3. Probability of Exactly Two Dice Not Showing a 1**\n* We need to consider all possible combinations of two dice not showing a 1 out of *n* dice. \n* This is a combination problem (order doesn't matter), and we can use the formula:  \n    *  nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!) \n    * where n is the total number of dice and r is the number of dice not showing a 1.\n**4.

Notice that (25/36)^2 is the same as (5/6)^4.  So, we can simplify the equation further:\n    * (n(n-1)) * (5/6)^4 * (1/6)^(n-2) = 50/216\n* Trying *n* = 4, we get:\n    * (4 * 3) * (5/6)^4 * (1/6)^2 = 50/216\n* This equation holds true.\n**Therefore, n = 4.** \n"
