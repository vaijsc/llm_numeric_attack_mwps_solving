    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "In one flip, we have a $1/2$ chance of getting heads and winning 2 dollars, and a $1/2$ chance of getting tails and losing 1 dollar.  So the expected value of one flip is $E = \\frac{1}{2}(\\$2) + \\frac{1}{2}(-\\$1) = \\boxed{\\$0.50}$.",

        "Here's how to calculate the expected value:\n**1. Probabilities:**\n* **Heads:** The probability of flipping heads is 1/2 (50%).\n* **Tails:** The probability of flipping tails is also 1/2 (50%).\n**2. Payoffs:**\n* **Heads:** You win $2.\n* **Tails:** You lose $1 (which is the same as winning -$1).\n**3. Expected Value Calculation:**\nThe expected value is calculated by multiplying the payoff of each outcome by its probability and then summing the results.\nExpected Value = (Probability of Heads * Payoff of Heads) + (Probability of Tails * Payoff of Tails)\nExpected Value = (1/2 * $2) + (1/2 * -$1)\nExpected Value = $1 - $0.50\n**Expected Value = $0.50**\n**Therefore, the expected value of your winnings after one flip is $0.50.** \n",
