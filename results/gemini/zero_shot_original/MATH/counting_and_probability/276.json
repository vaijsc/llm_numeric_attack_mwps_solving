    "solution": "We need to use casework. Suppose first that bag A is chosen: there is a $1/2$ chance of this occurring. There are ${5 \\choose 2} = \\frac{5 \\cdot 4}{2} = 10$ total ways to select two balls from bag A. If the two balls are the same color, then they must be either both white or both red. If both are white, then there are ${3\\choose 2} = 3$ ways to pick the two white balls, and if both are red, then there is $1$ way to pick the two red balls. Thus, the probability of selecting two balls of the same color from bag A is $\\frac{1+3}{10} = \\frac{2}{5}$.\n\nNext, suppose that bag B is chosen, again with $1/2$ chance. There are ${9 \\choose 2} = \\frac{9 \\cdot 8}{2} = 36$ ways to pick the two balls. There are ${6 \\choose 2} = \\frac{6 \\cdot 5}{2} = 15$ ways to pick two white balls, and ${3 \\choose 2} = 3$ ways to pick two red balls. Thus, the probability that two balls drawn from bag B are the same color is equal to $\\frac{15+3}{36} = \\frac 12$.\n\nThus, the probability that the balls have the same color is $\\frac 12 \\cdot \\frac 25 + \\frac 12 \\cdot \\frac 12 = \\boxed{\\frac 9{20}}$.",
