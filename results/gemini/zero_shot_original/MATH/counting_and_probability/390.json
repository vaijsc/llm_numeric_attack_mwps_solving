        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Understand Diagonals**\nA diagonal of a polygon is a line segment that connects two non-adjacent vertices. \n**2. Pattern Recognition**\n* **Triangle (3 sides):** 0 diagonals\n* **Quadrilateral (4 sides):** 2 diagonals\n* **Pentagon (5 sides):** 5 diagonals\n* **Hexagon (6 sides):** 9 diagonals\nNotice that the number of diagonals increases by 3, then 4, then 5. This pattern suggests that the increase in diagonals is related to the number of sides of the polygon.\n**3. The Formula**\nThe number of diagonals in a polygon with *n* sides is given by the formula:\n* **n(n-3) / 2**\n**4. Calculate for the Fifth Polygon**\nThe fifth polygon in the sequence has 7 sides (we can count them).

Let's find the pattern:\n* From 3 sides to 4 sides, the increase is 2.\n* From 4 sides to 5 sides, the increase is 3.\n* From 5 sides to 6 sides, the increase is 4.\n**Finding the Formula**\nThe pattern suggests that the increase in diagonals is equal to one less than the number of sides.  We can express this as a formula:\n* **Number of diagonals = (n - 3) * n / 2** \n   where 'n' is the number of sides of the polygon.\n**Applying the Formula**\nThe fifth polygon in the sequence is a heptagon (7 sides).  Let's plug in 'n = 7' into the formula:\n* Number of diagonals = (7 - 3) * 7 / 2 = 4 * 7 / 2 = 14\n**Answer**\nThe fifth polygon in the sequence has **14** diagonals. \n",

For a polygon with *n* sides:\n* Each vertex can connect to *n - 3* other vertices to form diagonals (we subtract 3 because we don't count the vertex itself or its two adjacent vertices).\n* Since there are *n* vertices, we might think there are *n(n - 3)* diagonals.\n* However, this counts each diagonal twice (once for each endpoint), so we divide by 2.\nTherefore, the formula for the number of diagonals in an *n*-sided polygon is:\n**Number of diagonals = n(n - 3) / 2**\n**Applying the Formula**\nThe fifth polygon in the sequence is a heptagon (7 sides).
