        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n* **Understand Factorials:**  A factorial (represented by the exclamation mark \"!\") means multiplying a number by all the positive whole numbers less than it. For example:\n    * 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120\n    * 3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6\n    * 2! = 2 * 1 = 2\n* **Calculate the Factorials:**\n    * 5! = 120\n    * 2! = 2\n    * 3! = 6\n* **Substitute and Simplify:**\n    * (5! * 2!) / 3! = (120 * 2) / 6 \n    * = 240 / 6\n    * = 40\n**Therefore, the value of (5! * 2!) / 3! is 40.** \n",
