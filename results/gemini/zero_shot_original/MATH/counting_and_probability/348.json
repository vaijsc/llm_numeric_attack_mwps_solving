    "solution": "Since Bin $A$ has one white ball and four black balls, the money ball has a $\\dfrac{1}{5}$ chance of coming from Bin $W$ and a $\\dfrac{4}{5}$ chance of coming from Bin $B$.  The total expected value therefore is $E = \\dfrac{1}{5}E_W + \\dfrac{4}{5}E_B$, where $E_W$ and $E_B$ are the expected values of a ball drawn from bins $W$ and $B$, respectively.  Since Bin $W$ has five 8 dollar balls and one 500 dollar ball, its expected value is \\[ E_W = \\frac{5}{6}\\times\\$8 + \\frac{1}{6}\\times\\$500 = \\$90. \\]Since Bin $B$ has three 1 dollar balls and one 7 dollar ball, its expected value is \\[ E_B = \\frac{3}{4} \\times \\$1 + \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\$7 = \\$2.5. \\]Therefore \\[ E = \\frac{1}{5}E_W + \\frac{4}{5}E_B = \\frac{1}{5}(\\$90) + \\frac{4}{5}(\\$2.5) = \\boxed{\\$20}. \\]",

        "Here's how to calculate the expected win step-by-step:\n**1. Probability of Picking a Black Ball from Bin A:**\n* There are 4 black balls and 1 white ball in bin A.\n* Probability of picking a black ball = 4/5\n**2. Probability of Picking a White Ball from Bin A:**\n* Probability of picking a white ball = 1/5\n**3. Expected Winnings from Bin B:**\n* **Probability of picking $1:** 3/4 (since there are 3 $1 balls out of 4)\n* **Probability of picking $7:** 1/4\n* **Expected Winnings from Bin B:** (3/4)($1) + (1/4)($7) = $2.50\n**4. Expected Winnings from Bin W:**\n* **Probability of picking $8:** 5/6 (since there are 5 $8 balls out of 6)\n* **Probability of picking $500:** 1/6\n* **Expected Winnings from Bin W:** (5/6)($8) + (1/6)($500) = $91.67\n**5. Overall Expected Winnings:**\n* **Expected winnings from black ball in Bin A:** (4/5)($2.50) = $2.00\n* **Expected winnings from white ball in Bin A:** (1/5)($91.67) = $18.33\n* **Overall Expected Winnings:** $2.00 + $18.33 = $20.33\n**Therefore, your expected win in this game is $20.33.** \n",
