    "solution": "When we expand this out, we get a bunch of terms with $\\sqrt7$ in them. To avoid painful estimation, we do the following trick: Add $(5-2\\sqrt7)^4$ to this expression. We know that $(5-2\\sqrt7)^4$ is small, since $2\\sqrt7=\\sqrt{28}$ is close to $5=\\sqrt{25}$, at least compared to $6=\\sqrt{36}$. When we add these together, the $\\sqrt7$ terms magically cancel out. By the Binomial Theorem, $$(5+2\\sqrt7)^4=5^4+4\\cdot5^3\\cdot(2\\sqrt7)+6\\cdot5^2\\cdot(2\\sqrt7)^2+4\\cdot5\\cdot(2\\sqrt7)^3+(2\\sqrt7)^4$$ whereas $$(5-2\\sqrt7)^4=5^4-4\\cdot5^3\\cdot(2\\sqrt7)+6\\cdot5^2\\cdot(2\\sqrt7)^2-4\\cdot5\\cdot(2\\sqrt7)^3+(2\\sqrt7)^4.$$ Therefore, their sum is $$2(5^4+6\\cdot5^2(2\\sqrt7)^2+(2\\sqrt7)^4)=2(625+4200+784)=11218.$$ Since the term we added, $(5-2\\sqrt7)^4$, is less than a half (actually, it's less than .01), $\\boxed{11218}$ is the closest integer to $(5+2\\sqrt7)^4$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Estimate the Value:**\n* Notice that $\\sqrt{7}$ is a little more than 2.6 (since 2.6\u00b2 = 6.76).\n* Therefore,  $5 + 2\\sqrt{7}$ is a little more than 5 + 2(2.6) = 10.2.\n**2. Consider the Exponent:**\n* We're raising a number slightly larger than 10 to the power of 4. This means the result will be significantly large.\n**3. Rough Approximation:**\n* Think of the number as roughly 10.  Raising 10 to the power of 4 gives us 10,000.  \n**4. Final Conclusion:**\n* Since we started with a slightly larger number than 10, the final result will be slightly larger than 10,000. \n* The nearest integer to $(5 + 2\\sqrt{7})^4$ is **10,000**. \n**Note:** While this method gives us a reasonable estimate, for an exact answer, you would need to use a calculator or a more precise method of calculation. \n",

        "Here's how we can solve this problem:\n**1. Estimate the Value of the Square Root**\n* We know that  2\u00b2 = 4 and 3\u00b2 = 9.  Since 7 is between 4 and 9, we know that \u221a7 is between 2 and 3. \n* Let's estimate \u221a7 to be about 2.6 (since 7 is closer to 9 than 4).\n**2. Approximate the Expression**\n* Substitute our estimate for \u221a7:  (5 + 2 * 2.6)\u2074 \u2248 (5 + 5.2)\u2074 = 10.2\u2074\n* 10.2\u2074 is a bit too much to calculate directly, but we can use the fact that 10\u00b2 = 100 to help us.\n*  10.2\u2074 \u2248 (10\u00b2 * 1.02\u00b2)\u00b2  \u2248 (100 * 1.04)\u00b2  \u2248 108\u00b2\n**3. Approximate the Square**\n* 108\u00b2 is close to 100\u00b2 = 10,000.  Since 108 is a bit bigger than 100, its square will be a bit bigger than 10,000.\n**4. Conclusion**\n* Based on our approximations, (5 + 2\u221a7)\u2074 is likely slightly larger than 10,000. \n* Therefore, the nearest integer to (5 + 2\u221a7)\u2074 is **10,001**. \n**Important Note:** This is an approximation. To get the exact answer, you'd need to use a calculator to compute (5 + 2\u221a7)\u2074. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1.  Approximate the value inside the parentheses:**\n* We know that $\\sqrt{7}$ is a little more than 2.6 (since 2.6\u00b2 = 6.76 and 2.7\u00b2 = 7.29).\n* So, $5 + 2\\sqrt{7}$ is approximately 5 + 2(2.6) = 10.2.\n**2.  Estimate the result of raising to the fourth power:**\n* Since 10.2 is a little larger than 10, we know  10.2\u2074 will be a little larger than 10\u2074, which is 10,000.\n**3.  Determine the nearest integer:**\n* Since 10.2 is closer to 10 than 11, the nearest integer to (10.2)\u2074 will be closer to 10,000 than 11,000. \n**Therefore, the nearest integer to (5 + 2\u221a7)\u2074 is 10,000.** \n",

Estimate the Value**\n*  Notice that $\\sqrt{7}$ is a bit more than 2.6 (since $2.6^2 = 6.76$).\n*  Therefore, $5 + 2\\sqrt{7}$ is a bit more than $5 + 2(2.6) = 10.2$. \n*  So, $(5 + 2\\sqrt{7})^4$ is a bit more than $10.2^4$, which is roughly 10,000.\n**2.
