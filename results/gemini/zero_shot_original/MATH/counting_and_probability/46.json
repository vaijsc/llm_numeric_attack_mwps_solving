    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The only way in which there won't be two dice displaying the same number is if exactly one number between 1 and 6 isn't being displayed on any of the dice and the 5 dice all display different numbers. There are 6 different possibilities for the number that isn't being displayed, and then there are a total of $5!$ ways in which the 5 dice displaying different numbers can be arranged, so there are a total of $6\\cdot5!$ outcomes that result in the dice all displaying different numbers. Since each of the 5 dice can have 6 results when rolled and all of the rolls are determined independently, there are a total of $6^5$ possible outcomes, which means that the probability of all of the dice showing different numbers is $\\dfrac{6\\cdot5!}{6^5}=\\dfrac{5}{54}$, so the probability that we want is $1-\\dfrac{5}{54}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{49}{54}}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Calculate the probability of NO matching dice**\n* For the first die, there are 6 possible outcomes.\n* For the second die, there are 5 remaining outcomes that don't match the first.\n* For the third die, there are 4 remaining outcomes that don't match the first two.\n* And so on...\nSo, the total number of outcomes with no matching dice is 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 = 720\n* The total number of possible outcomes when rolling 5 dice is 6 * 6 * 6 * 6 * 6 = 6\u2075 = 7776\n* The probability of getting NO matching dice is 720 / 7776 = 5/55\n**2. Calculate the probability of at least two dice matching**\n* Since the only two possibilities are \"no matching dice\" or \"at least two dice matching\", these probabilities must add up to 1.\n* Therefore, the probability of at least two dice matching is 1 - (5/55) = **50/55** \n**Simplified, this probability is approximately 0.909 or 90.9%.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Calculate the Probability of NO Matching Dice**\n* For the first die, it can be any of the six numbers.\n* For the second die, it must be different from the first, leaving only 5 possibilities.\n* For the third die, there are only 4 possibilities left.\n* And so on...\nTherefore, the probability of getting no matching dice is:\n(6/6) * (5/6) * (4/6) * (3/6) * (2/6) = 5/54\n**2. Calculate the Probability of At Least Two Matching Dice**\nSince the only two possibilities are either \"no matching dice\" or \"at least two matching dice\", these probabilities must add up to 1.  \nTherefore, the probability of getting at least two matching dice is:\n1 - (5/54) = **49/54** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1.  Calculate the probability of the opposite event**\nIt's easier to calculate the probability of the event *not* happening (all dice showing different numbers), and then subtract that from 1 to get the probability of at least two dice showing the same number.\n* **First die:**  There are 6 possibilities.\n* **Second die:** To be different from the first, there are 5 possibilities.\n* **Third die:** There are 4 possibilities left.\n* **Fourth die:** There are 3 possibilities left.\n* **Fifth die:** There are 2 possibilities left.\nSo, the total number of ways to get all different numbers is 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 = 720\nThe total number of possible outcomes for rolling 5 dice is 6 * 6 * 6 * 6 * 6 = 6\u2075 = 7776\nThe probability of getting all different numbers is 720 / 7776 = 5/55.\n**2.  Calculate the probability of the desired event**\nThe probability of at least two dice showing the same number is:\n1 - (probability of all different numbers) = 1 - (5/55) = **50/55** \n**Therefore, the probability of at least two dice showing the same number is 50/55 or approximately 90.9%.** \n",

Calculate the probability of the opposite event**\nIt's often easier to calculate the probability of the event *not* happening, and then subtract from 1.  The opposite event is that *all five dice show different numbers*.\n* **First die:**  It can be any of the six numbers.\n* **Second die:** To have a different number, it has only 5 options left.\n* **Third die:** It has 4 options left.\n* **Fourth die:** It has 3 options left.\n* **Fifth die:** It has 2 options left.\nSo, the total number of ways to get all different numbers is 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 = 720\nThe total number of possible outcomes for rolling five dice is 6 * 6 * 6 * 6 * 6 = 6\u2075 = 7776\nTherefore, the probability of getting all different numbers is 720 / 7776 = 5/55\n**2.
