        "Here's how we can solve the problem step by step:\n**1. Simplify the Factorials:**\n*  3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6\n* (3!)! = 6! = 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720\n* ((3!)!)! = 720!\n**2. Rewrite the Equation:**\nNow our equation looks like this: \n \n  ```\n  720! / 6 = k * n!\n  ```\n**3.  Find the Largest Possible 'n'**\nTo maximize 'n', we want to extract the largest possible factorial from 720! that leaves a relatively small integer (our 'k').  Notice that 720! contains the factorial of every number from 1 up to 720.  We can factor out 719!  :\n```\n720! / 6 = (720 * 719!) / 6\n```\n**4. Simplify and Find 'k'**\nNow we have:\n```\n (720 * 719!) / 6 = (120 * 719!) = k * n!\n```\nTherefore, we can see:\n* **n = 719** (the largest possible factorial)\n* **k = 120** \n**5. Calculate k + n**\nFinally:\nk + n = 120 + 719 = **839** \n",

Simplify the Expression**\nThe expression becomes: \n  \n  (720!) / 6 \n**3.  Understanding the Pattern**\nNotice that 720! is a very large product of consecutive integers, including 6. Therefore, we can factor out a 6 from the numerator:\n   (720!) / 6 = (6 * 719 * 718 * ... * 2 * 1) / 6 = 719 * 718 * ... * 2 * 1\n**4. Identifying n and k**\nThe simplified expression is the factorial of 719. This means:\n* **n = 719**  (the largest possible value of n)\n* **k = 1**  (since we have 719! remaining after removing the 6)\n**5. Calculate k + n**\nk + n = 1 + 719 = **720** \n",

Rewrite the Expression**\nThe problem becomes: \n   \n   ```\n   720! / 6 = k * n!\n   ```\n**3. Find the Largest Possible 'n'**\nWe want to make 'n' as large as possible. This means we want to factor out the largest possible factorial from 720!. Notice that 720! contains the factorial of every integer from 1 to 720.\n* **Key Observation:**  720! can be expressed as 720 * 719 * 718 * ... * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1.  This is the same as 720 * 719!\n**4. Substitute and Solve**\nNow we have:\n```\n(720 * 719!) / 6 = k * n!\n```\nTo make 'n' as large as possible, let  n = 719.  This gives us:\n```\n(720 * 719!) / 6 = k * 719!\n```\nSimplify by dividing both sides by 719!:\n```\n720 / 6 = k\n```\nTherefore, k = 120.\n**5.

Identify k and n:**\n* **n:** The largest factorial we can factor out is 5!, so n = 5.\n* **k:** The remaining product (120 * 719 * 718 * ... * 6) is our value for k.\n**5. Calculate k + n:**\nSince k is a very large number, it's not necessary to calculate it exactly.  We know:\n* k + n = (120 * 719 * 718 * ... * 6) + 5\n**Therefore, k + n is a large integer that is 5 more than the product of integers from 6 to 719.** \n",
