        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Counting the Total Rectangles**\n* **Smallest Rectangles:**  There are 16 individual grid points, each of which can be considered a 1x1 square.\n* **2x2 Squares:** There are 9 of these.\n* **3x3 Squares:** There are 4 of these.\n* **4x4 Squares:** There is 1 of these.\n* **2x1 Rectangles:** There are 3 horizontal and 3 vertical ones in each row/column, for a total of 12.\n* **3x1 Rectangles:** There are 2 horizontal and 2 vertical ones in each row/column, for a total of 8.\n* **3x2 Rectangles:** There are 2 horizontal and 2 vertical ones in each row/column, for a total of 8.\n* **4x1 Rectangles:** There is 1 horizontal and 1 vertical one in each row/column, for a total of 4.\n* **4x2 Rectangles:** There is 1 horizontal and 1 vertical one in each row/column, for a total of 4.\n* **4x3 Rectangles:** There is 1 horizontal and 1 vertical one in each row/column, for a total of 4.\nAdding all of these up, we get a total of 68 rectangles.\n**2. Counting the Squares**\nWe already counted the squares in the first step:\n* 1x1 squares: 16\n* 2x2 squares: 9\n* 3x3 squares: 4\n* 4x4 squares: 1\nThis gives us a total of 30 squares.\n**3. The Fraction**\nThe fraction of rectangles in set R that are squares is:\n(Number of Squares) / (Total Number of Rectangles) = 30 / 68 = **15/34** \n",
        "**1. Count the total number of rectangles:**\n* To form a rectangle, we need to choose two horizontal grid lines and two vertical grid lines.\n* There are 6 horizontal grid lines (including the top and bottom edges) and 6 vertical grid lines.\n* So, the total number of rectangles is  \u2076C\u2082 * \u2076C\u2082 = 15 * 15 = 225.\n**2. Count the number of squares:**\n* A square is formed when the horizontal and vertical sides are the same length.\n* We can have squares of side length 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n* There are 4 squares of side length 1, 3 squares of side length 2, 2 squares of side length 3, and 1 square of side length 4. \n* This gives us a total of 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10 squares.\n**3. Calculate the fraction:**\nThe fraction of squares in set R is the number of squares divided by the total number of rectangles:\n10/225 = **2/45** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Counting the Total Rectangles**\n* **Choose two points for the top and bottom of the rectangle:** There are 5 choices for the top row and 5 choices for the bottom row, giving us 5 * 5 = 25 ways to choose the top and bottom.\n* **Choose two points for the left and right sides of the rectangle:**  Similarly, there are 5 * 5 = 25 ways to choose the left and right sides.\nHowever, we've overcounted!  For example, choosing the top row as (0, 0) and the bottom row as (4, 4) is the same rectangle as choosing the top row as (4, 4) and the bottom row as (0, 0).  We've also overcounted because we've counted squares multiple times (choosing opposite corners).\n**2. Correcting for Overcounting**\n* **Dividing by 2:** To correct for choosing the top and bottom rows in either order, we divide our initial count by 2. This gives us 25 * 25 / 2 = 312.5. Since we can't have half a rectangle, this means we've overcounted some squares.\n* **Squares:**  There are 4 squares (1x1, 2x2, 3x3, and 4x4).  Each square has been counted 4 times (once for each possible pair of opposite corners).  We need to subtract 3 counts for each of the squares.\n**3. Final Calculation**\n* **Total Rectangles:**  312.5 - (3 * 4) = 300.5.  Again, since we can't have half a rectangle, we know we've overcounted slightly. We'll use the closest whole number, 300, as our total.\n* **Squares:**  We have 4 squares.\n* **Fraction of Squares:**  4 / 300 = **1/75** \nTherefore, the fraction of rectangles in set R that are squares is **1/75**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Counting the Total Rectangles**\n* **Smallest rectangles:**  There are 16 single-unit squares (1x1).\n* **Slightly larger rectangles:**  There are 9 rectangles that are 2x1 or 1x2.\n* **Even larger rectangles:** There are 4 rectangles that are 3x1 or 1x3.\n* **The largest rectangle:** There is 1 rectangle that is 4x1 or 1x4.\nIn total, there are 16 + 9 + 4 + 1 = **30** rectangles possible.\n**2.

Finding the Fraction**\nThe fraction of squares in the set is the number of squares divided by the total number of rectangles: 17/30. \n**Answer:** The fraction of rectangles in set R that are squares is **17/30**. \n",
