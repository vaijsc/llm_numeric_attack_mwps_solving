    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are five digits greater than $4$ (5, 6, 7, 8, and 9), and each of the first three zip code digits could be any of them. Hence, there are $5\\cdot 5\\cdot 5 = 125$ ways to choose the first three digits. The last two zip code digits have no restrictions, so there are $10 \\cdot 10 = 100$ ways to choose them. Thus, there are $125 \\cdot 100 = \\boxed{12500}$ such zip codes.",

        "Here's how to solve this step-by-step:\n**1.  Understanding the Constraints:**\n* **Five-digit zip codes:** This means we have five spaces to fill with digits.\n* **First three digits greater than 4:** This means the first three spaces can only be filled with the digits 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.\n**2.  Counting Possibilities:**\n* **First digit:** We have 5 choices (5, 6, 7, 8, 9).\n* **Second digit:** We also have 5 choices.\n* **Third digit:** Again, 5 choices.\n* **Fourth digit:** We have 10 choices (0-9).\n* **Fifth digit:** We have 10 choices.\n**3.  Calculating Total Possibilities:**\nTo find the total number of possible zip codes, we multiply the number of choices for each digit:\n5 * 5 * 5 * 10 * 10 = **12,500**\n**Therefore, there are 12,500 five-digit zip codes where the first three digits are greater than 4.** \n",

        "Here's how to solve this step-by-step:\n**1. Understanding the Restrictions:**\n* We need five-digit zip codes.\n* The first three digits must be greater than 4. This means they can be 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 (a total of 5 choices).\n**2. Filling the Digits:**\n* **First three digits:** We have 5 options for each of the first three digits (5, 6, 7, 8, or 9). \n* **Fourth and fifth digits:** There are no restrictions on the fourth and fifth digits. They can be any of the ten digits from 0 to 9.\n**3. Calculating the Possibilities:**\n* **First three digits:** 5 options for each digit, so 5 * 5 * 5 = 125 possibilities.\n* **Fourth and fifth digits:** 10 options for each digit, so 10 * 10 = 100 possibilities.\n**4. Total Possibilities:**\nTo get the total number of valid zip codes, we multiply the possibilities for each set of digits: 125 * 100 = **12,500**\n**Therefore, there are 12,500 five-digit zip codes where the first three digits are greater than 4.** \n",
