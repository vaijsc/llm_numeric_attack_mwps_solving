    "solution": "The probability that both marbles are red is given by: $$ P(\\text{both red}) = P(\\text{1st red}) \\times P(\\text{2nd red \\textbf{after} 1st red is drawn}). $$The probability that the first marble is red is $\\frac{4}{10}$.  After drawing a red marble, there are 3 red marbles and 9 marbles total left in the bag, so the probability that the second marble is also red is $\\frac{3}{9}$.  Therefore $$ P(\\text{both red}) = \\frac{4}{10}\\times \\frac{3}{9} = \\frac{2}{15}. $$Similarly, the probability that both marbles are blue is given by: $$ P(\\text{both blue}) = P(\\text{1st blue}) \\times P(\\text{2nd blue \\textbf{after} 1st blue drawn}). $$The probability that that the first marble is blue is $\\frac{6}{10}$.  After drawing a blue marble, there are 5 blue marbles and 9 marbles total left in the bag, so the probability that the second marble is also blue is $\\frac{5}{9}$.  Therefore $$ P(\\text{both blue}) = \\frac{6}{10}\\times \\frac{5}{9} = \\frac{1}{3}. $$Since drawing two red marbles and drawing two blue marbles are exclusive events, we add the individual probabilities to get the probability of one or the other occurring.  Therefore: \\begin{align*}P(\\text{both same color}) &= P(\\text{both red}) + P(\\text{both blue}) \\\\ &= \\frac{2}{15} + \\frac{1}{3} = \\boxed{ \\frac{7}{15}}. \\end{align*}",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step by step:\n**Scenario 1: Both marbles are red**\n* **Probability of picking a red marble first:** 4 red marbles / 10 total marbles = 2/5\n* **Probability of picking another red marble after taking out the first:** 3 red marbles / 9 total marbles = 1/3 \n* **Probability of Scenario 1:** (2/5) * (1/3) = 2/15\n**Scenario 2: Both marbles are blue**\n* **Probability of picking a blue marble first:** 6 blue marbles / 10 total marbles = 3/5\n* **Probability of picking another blue marble after taking out the first:** 5 blue marbles / 9 total marbles = 5/9\n* **Probability of Scenario 2:** (3/5) * (5/9) = 1/3\n**Final Calculation**\nSince these two scenarios are mutually exclusive (they can't both happen at the same time), we add their probabilities to find the overall probability of getting two marbles of the same color:\n2/15 + 1/3 = 7/15\n**Therefore, the probability of selecting two marbles of the same color is 7/15.** \n",
        "Here's how to break down the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Probability of getting a red marble, then another red marble:**\n* **First marble:** The probability of selecting a red marble is 4 (red marbles) / 10 (total marbles) = 2/5.\n* **Second marble:** After taking out one red marble, there are only 3 left, and 9 total marbles. So the probability of selecting another red is 3/9 = 1/3.\n* **Combined Probability:** To get the probability of both events happening, we multiply: (2/5) * (1/3) = 2/15\n**2. Probability of getting a blue marble, then another blue marble:**\n* **First marble:** The probability of selecting a blue marble is 6/10 = 3/5.\n* **Second marble:** After taking out one blue marble, there are only 5 left, and 9 total marbles. So the probability of selecting another blue is 5/9.\n* **Combined Probability:** (3/5) * (5/9) = 1/3\n**3. Adding the probabilities together:**\nSince we want the probability of getting either two red OR two blue, we add the probabilities we calculated:\n2/15 + 1/3 = 7/15\n**Therefore, the probability of selecting two marbles of the same color is 7/15.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Probability of picking a red marble then another red marble:**\n* **First marble red:**  The probability of picking a red marble is 4 (red marbles) / 10 (total marbles) = 2/5\n* **Second marble red (given the first was red):** Since we don't replace the first marble, there are only 3 red marbles left and 9 total marbles.
