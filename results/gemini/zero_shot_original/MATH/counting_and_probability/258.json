    "problem": "In how many ways can 4 distinct beads be placed on a bracelet that has a knot in it?  (Beads cannot slide past the knot.  Two ways are considered the same if one is a reflection of the other, since we can flip the bracelet over.)",

    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "We can just treat the knot as another bead. There are $5!$ ways to place the beads and the knot on the bracelet, but we must divide by 5 for rotational symmetry (5 rotations for each arrangement), and by 2 for reflectional symmetry (we can flip the bracelet to get the same arrangement).  The answer is $\\dfrac{5!}{5 \\times 2} = \\boxed{12}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Consider all possible arrangements without restrictions:**\n* If we had a straight line of beads, there would be 4! = 24 ways to arrange them (4 choices for the first bead, 3 for the second, and so on).\n**2.  Account for rotations:**\n* Since the bracelet is circular, we can rotate any arrangement to get the same one. There are 4 rotations for each arrangement (rotating by 0, 90, 180, or 270 degrees).\n**3.  Adjust for reflections:**\n* The knot makes the bracelet asymmetrical. This means we don't need to worry about reflections because flipping the bracelet over will create a different arrangement. \n**4.  Calculate the number of distinct arrangements:**\n* We divide the number of unrestricted arrangements by the number of rotations for each arrangement: 24 arrangements / 4 rotations per arrangement = **6 distinct arrangements**.\n**Therefore, there are 6 ways to place 4 distinct beads on a bracelet with a knot.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Treat the bracelet like a line:**\n* Imagine the bracelet is a straight line with the knot at one end.\n* The first bead has 4 choices of where to go on this line.\n* The second bead has 3 choices left.\n* The third bead has 2 choices left.\n* The last bead only has 1 choice left.\nThis gives us 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24 ways to arrange the beads on the line.\n**2. Account for the bracelet being circular:**\n* Since the bracelet is circular, we've overcounted because rotating the beads doesn't create a new arrangement (e.g., ABCD is the same as BCDA).\n* There are 4 rotations that are considered the same (ABCD, BCDA, CDAB, DABC). \n* To correct for this, we divide our previous result by 4.\n**3. Account for reflections:**\n* Since we can flip the bracelet, we've also overcounted arrangements that are reflections of each other.\n* For each arrangement, there's one reflection that's considered the same. \n* Therefore, we need to divide our result by 2.\n**Calculation:**\n* (24 ways / 4 rotations) / 2 reflections = 3 ways\n**Answer:** There are **3** ways to place 4 distinct beads on a bracelet with a knot. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Step 1:  Ignoring the Knot**\n* Imagine the bracelet is a straight line.  How many ways can you arrange 4 distinct beads?  This is simply a permutation, and there are 4! = 24 ways.\n**Step 2: Accounting for the Knot**\n* The knot divides the bracelet into two halves.  For each arrangement on one half, there's a corresponding arrangement on the other half. \n* Since we don't care about flipping the bracelet, we've overcounted our arrangements by a factor of 2.\n**Step 3:  The Final Calculation**\n* To get the correct number of arrangements, divide the number of arrangements ignoring the knot by 2:  24 / 2 = 12.\n**Therefore, there are 12 ways to place 4 distinct beads on a bracelet with a knot.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Imagine a Linear Arrangement**\n* If the bracelet were a straight line, there would be 4! = 24 ways to arrange the beads. \n**2. Account for Rotations**\n* Since the bracelet is circular, we need to account for rotations.  Each arrangement can be rotated into 4 identical positions.\n* Therefore, we divide the number of linear arrangements by 4: 24 / 4 = 6.\n**3. Account for Reflections**\n* Since we can flip the bracelet, each unique arrangement has a reflection. \n* We need to divide our current count by 2: 6 / 2 = 3\n**Answer:** There are **3** distinct ways to arrange the beads on the bracelet. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Consider a Linear Arrangement**\nImagine the beads are placed on a straight line instead of a bracelet.  There are 4! = 24 ways to arrange 4 distinct beads in a line.\n**2. Account for Rotations**\nSince the beads are on a bracelet, we need to consider rotations.  Each linear arrangement can be rotated 3 times to create 4 identical arrangements.  \n**3. Account for Reflections**\nNow, we need to account for reflections. Because there's a knot, we can only reflect the bracelet across the line containing the knot. This means each linear arrangement will have exactly one reflection.\n**4. Calculate the Final Count**\n* We started with 24 linear arrangements.\n* We divided by 4 to account for rotations (24 / 4 = 6).\n* We divided by 2 to account for reflections (6 / 2 = 3).\n**Therefore, there are 3 distinct ways to place 4 distinct beads on a bracelet with a knot.** \n"
