All we need to check now are $\\binom{6}{2}$ and $\\binom{6}{3}$, since $\\binom{6}{0} = \\binom{6}{6}$, $\\binom{6}{1} = \\binom{6}{5}$ , and $\\binom{6}{2} = \\binom{6}{4}$. $\\binom{6}{2} = \\frac{6!}{4! \\times 2!} = 15$, and $\\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3! \\times 3!} = 20$.

        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**Understanding Pascal's Triangle**\n* **Rows:** Pascal's Triangle is arranged in rows, starting with row 0.\n* **Elements:** Each element in a row is the sum of the two elements directly above it.\n* **First and Last:** The first and last elements of each row are always 1.\n**Finding the Row**\n* The row starting with 1, 6 corresponds to row 6. \n* This is because the second element of a row (the one after the initial 1) is the row number.\n**Analyzing the Row**\n* Row 6: 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1\n*  We need to check if any of these numbers are prime.\n**Prime Numbers**\n* **Definition:** A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 that has only two divisors: 1 and itself.\n**Checking the Row**\n* 1 is not a prime number (it only has one divisor).\n* 6 is not a prime number (it is divisible by 2 and 3).\n* 15 is not a prime number (it is divisible by 3 and 5).\n* 20 is not a prime number (it is divisible by 2, 4, 5, and 10).\n**Answer**\nTherefore, there are **no prime numbers** in the row of Pascal's Triangle that starts with 1, 6. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**Understanding Pascal's Triangle**\nPascal's Triangle is a triangular array of numbers where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. The first few rows look like this:\n```\n        1\n       1 1\n      1 2 1\n     1 3 3 1\n    1 4 6 4 1\n   1 5 10 10 5 1\n  1 6 15 20 15 6 1 \n```\n**The Row in Question**\nThe row that starts with 1, 6 is the 7th row (we start counting rows from 0).\n**Finding the Primes**\n* **The first number is 1:** 1 is not considered prime.\n* **The second number is 6:** 6 is not prime (it's divisible by 2 and 3).\n* **The third number is 15:** 15 is not prime (it's divisible by 3 and 5).\n* **The fourth number is 20:** 20 is not prime (it's divisible by 2, 4, 5, and 10).\n* **The fifth number is 15:** 15 is not prime (it's divisible by 3 and 5).\n* **The sixth number is 6:** 6 is not prime (it's divisible by 2 and 3).\n* **The seventh number is 1:** 1 is not considered prime.\n**Conclusion**\nThere are **no prime numbers** in the row of Pascal's Triangle that starts with 1, 6. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding Pascal's Triangle**\n* **Rows:** Pascal's Triangle is arranged in rows, starting with row 0 at the top.\n* **Elements:** Each element in a row is the sum of the two elements directly above it. \n* **Symmetry:** Pascal's Triangle is symmetrical, meaning the elements on either side of the middle element are the same.\n**Finding the Row**\n1. **First Element:** The row starts with a 1. This is the typical pattern for the first element in each row.\n2. **Second Element:** The second element is 6.  This means the row is row 6 (since the second element in row n is n).\n**Prime Numbers in Row 6**\nNow, let's examine row 6 of Pascal's Triangle:\n1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1\nThe prime numbers in this row are:\n* **2** (not shown in the row itself but is a factor of 6, 15, 20)\n* **3** (a factor of 6, 15)\n* **5** (a factor of 15, 20)\n* **7** (not shown in the row itself but is a factor of 15, 20)\n**Answer:**\nTherefore, there are **four** primes in the row of Pascal's Triangle that starts with 1 and 6. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding Pascal's Triangle**\n* **Rows and Elements:** Pascal's Triangle is arranged in rows, with the top row being row 0. Each element in a row is the sum of the two elements directly above it.\n* **Binomial Coefficients:**  The elements in Pascal's Triangle are called binomial coefficients. The element in the *k*th position of the *n*th row is denoted by  \"n choose k\" or  $\\binom{n}{k}$, which is calculated as $\\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$.\n**Finding the Row**\n* **Start with the '1' and '6':** The row we're looking at starts with a '1' and a '6'. This means the second element in the row is 6.\n* **Binomial Coefficient:** The second element in row *n* is represented by $\\binom{n}{1}$. We know this is equal to 6. \n* **Solving for 'n':**  $\\binom{n}{1} = \\frac{n!}{1!(n-1)!} = n = 6$.
