    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are 12 total slices, and 5 of them have pepperoni and 8 have mushrooms. Let $n$ be the number that have both toppings. So, there are $5-n$ slices with only pepperoni and $8-n$ with only mushrooms.  So, there are a total of $n + (5-n) + (8-n)$ slices.  Since there are 12 slices, we have $(5-n) + (8-n) + n = 12$, from which we find that $n=\\boxed{1}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n* **Start with the total:** We know there are 12 slices of pizza.\n* **Slices with mushrooms:** 8 slices have mushrooms.\n* **Slices with pepperoni:** 5 slices have pepperoni.\n* **Overlapping:** If we simply add the number of slices with mushrooms and the number of slices with pepperoni (8 + 5 = 13), we get a number larger than the total number of slices. This means some slices must have both toppings. \n* **Calculate the overlap:** To find the overlap, subtract the number of slices with pepperoni from the number of slices with mushrooms and add the total number of slices: 8 + 12 - 5 = 15.  Then subtract the total number of slices from that number: 15 - 12 = 3.\n* **Answer:** Therefore, **3** slices have both pepperoni and mushrooms. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n* **Start with the total:** We know there are 12 slices in total.\n* **Pepperoni only:** 5 slices have pepperoni, and we know every slice has at least one topping, so 12 - 5 = 7 slices must have only mushrooms.\n* **Mushrooms only:**  We know 8 slices have mushrooms, and 7 of them have only mushrooms.  Therefore, 8 - 7 = 1 slice must have both pepperoni and mushrooms.\n**Answer:** 1 slice has both pepperoni and mushrooms. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n1. **Start with the total:** We know there are 12 slices in total.\n2. **Slices with only mushrooms:** Since 8 slices have mushrooms and 5 have pepperoni, we know there are 8 - 5 = 3 slices with only mushrooms.\n3. **Slices with both:** We know 5 slices have pepperoni, and 3 have only mushrooms.  Therefore, 5 - 3 = 2 slices must have both pepperoni and mushrooms.\n**Answer:** There are **2** slices with both pepperoni and mushrooms. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Start with the total:**\n* We know there are 12 slices in total.\n**2. Consider the slices with mushrooms:**\n*  8 slices have mushrooms.\n**3.  Think about the overlap:**\n* Since 5 slices have pepperoni, and we know all slices have at least one topping, the remaining 3 slices (12 - 5 = 7, and 7 - 4 = 3) must only have mushrooms.\n**4. Find the slices with both:**\n* We know 8 slices have mushrooms, and 3 of those only have mushrooms.  \n* Therefore, 5 slices must have both pepperoni and mushrooms (8 - 3 = 5).\n**Answer:** There are **5** slices with both pepperoni and mushrooms. \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem:\n* **Start with the total:** We know there are 12 slices in total.\n* **Slices with pepperoni:** 5 slices have pepperoni.\n* **Slices with mushrooms:** 8 slices have mushrooms.\n* **Overlapping slices:**  To find the number of slices with both toppings, we need to account for the fact that some slices with mushrooms might also have pepperoni. \n* **Logic:**  If we simply add the number of slices with pepperoni and the number of slices with mushrooms (5 + 8 = 13), we're counting some slices twice (the ones with both toppings). \n* **Calculation:** To find the number of slices with both toppings, subtract the total number of slices (12) from the sum of the slices with each topping (13): 13 - 12 = 1.\n**Therefore, 1 slice has both pepperoni and mushrooms.** \n"
