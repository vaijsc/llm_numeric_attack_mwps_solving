    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "We can break this problem into three parts.  First, we will count the number of ways to choose teachers for the subcommittee.  We need to choose 2 teachers from the 5 in the school organization, which gives $\\dbinom{5}{2}=10$ ways to choose the teachers.  Next, we choose parents.  We need to choose 3 parents out of 7, which gives $\\dbinom{7}{3}=35$ ways to choose the parents.  Finally, we choose the students.  There are 3 students chosen from 6, which gives $\\dbinom{6}{3}=20$ ways to choose the students.  Each of these selections is independent, so the total number of possible subcommittees will be $10\\cdot 35\\cdot 20=\\boxed{7000}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Choosing the Teachers:**\n* We need to choose 2 teachers out of 5.  This is a combination problem (order doesn't matter).\n* The formula for combinations is:  nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!) \n* So, the number of ways to choose 2 teachers is 5C2 = 5! / (2! * 3!) = 10\n**2. Choosing the Parents:**\n* We need to choose 3 parents out of 7.\n* The number of ways to choose 3 parents is 7C3 = 7! / (3! * 4!) = 35\n**3. Choosing the Students:**\n* We need to choose 3 students out of 6.\n* The number of ways to choose 3 students is 6C3 = 6! / (3! * 3!) = 20\n**4. Combining the Choices:**\n* To find the total number of different subcommittees, we multiply the number of ways to choose each group: 10 * 35 * 20 = **7000**\n**Therefore, there are 7000 different subcommittees that can be formed.** \n",
