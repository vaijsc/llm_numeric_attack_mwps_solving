        "Here's how we can solve this problem:\n**1. Understanding the Grid:**\nImagine the points labeled with letters forming a grid.  The 'M' is at the center, the 'A's are one step away, the 'T's are two steps away, and the 'H's are three steps away.\n**2. Breaking Down the Word \"MATH\":**\n* We need to move from 'M' to 'A' first.\n* Then from 'A' to 'T'.\n* Next from 'T' to 'H'.\n**3. Analyzing Each Move:**\n* **M to A:** There are four possible moves (up, down, left, right).\n* **A to T:**  You need to move two steps away from the 'A'. This could be done in a few ways:\n    * Two steps in one direction (e.g., two steps right)\n    * One step in one direction, then one step in another (e.g., one step right, then one step up)\n* **T to H:**  Similar to the 'A to T' move, you need to move one step further away from the center.\n**4. Counting the Paths:**\nLet's count the paths systematically:\n* **M to A:** 4 options\n* **A to T:**  For each 'A', there are 8 possible 'T' positions (think of the directions you can move - up-right, up-left, down-right, down-left, etc.).  \n* **T to H:** From each 'T', there are 12 possible 'H' positions.\n**5. Total Paths:**\nTo get the total number of paths, we multiply the possibilities at each step:\n4 options (M to A) * 8 options (A to T) * 12 options (T to H) = **384**\n**Therefore, there are 384 distinct paths you can follow to spell the word \"MATH\" on this grid.** \n",
        "Here's how to break down the problem and find the solution:\n**1. Understand the Pattern**\n* The letters form a square pattern, expanding outward from the origin (M).\n* To spell \"MATH\", you need to move to an \"A\", then a \"T\", then another \"A\", and finally an \"H\".\n**2. Count Paths to Each Letter**\n* **To \"A\":** You have 4 possible paths (up, down, left, right) to reach any of the \"A\"s.\n* **To \"T\" from \"A\":** Once you're at an \"A\", you have 3 possible paths to reach a \"T\" (move in the same direction you came from, or one of the two other directions).\n* **To \"A\" from \"T\":** Similarly, you have 3 possible paths to move from a \"T\" to another \"A\".\n* **To \"H\" from \"A\":**  You have 3 possible paths to move from an \"A\" to an \"H\".\n**3. Multiply to Find Total Paths**\nTo get the total number of distinct paths, multiply the number of possibilities for each step:\n4 (paths to A) * 3 (paths to T) * 3 (paths to A) * 3 (paths to H) = **108 distinct paths**\n**Therefore, there are 108 distinct paths you can follow to spell \"MATH\" on this grid.** \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Understanding the Movement:**\n* You can only move one unit up, down, left, or right. \n* You need to land on an 'M', then an 'A', then a 'T', and finally an 'H' to spell MATH.\n**2.  Finding Paths to 'A':**\n* From the origin (M), you can reach an 'A' in four ways: \n    * Move right one unit.\n    * Move left one unit.\n    * Move up one unit.\n    * Move down one unit.\n**3. Finding Paths to 'T' from Each 'A':**\n* From each 'A', you can reach a 'T' in several ways. Let's consider each 'A' position:\n    * **A at (1, 0):** You can move right to reach (2, 0), or up to reach (1, 1), both are 'T's.\n    * **A at (-1, 0):** You can move left to reach (-2, 0), or up to reach (-1, 1), both are 'T's.\n    * **A at (0, 1):** You can move up to reach (0, 2), or right to reach (1, 1), both are 'T's.\n    * **A at (0, -1):** You can move down to reach (0, -2), or left to reach (-1, -1), both are 'T's.\n**4. Finding Paths to 'H' from Each 'T':**\n* From each 'T', you can reach an 'H' in various ways.  We'll need to check each 'T' position and see how many 'H's it can reach.  \n**5. Counting Total Paths:**\n* To get the total number of paths, we need to count the paths from M to A, then multiply that by the number of paths from each A to T, and finally by the number of paths from each T to H.  This is a bit tedious, but we can organize it:\n* **Paths from M to A:** 4\n* **Paths from A to T (for each A):** 2\n* **Paths from T to H (for each T):** This will vary depending on the 'T' position, so we'll need to count them individually.\n**Example:  Let's take one path and calculate its possibilities**\n* **M -> (1, 0) -> (2, 0) -> (3, 0):** \n    * This is one path from M to A to T to H.  \n    *  There are 3 other paths from (3, 0) to other 'H's.\n**6. Summing Up:**\n* You'd need to repeat this process for each possible path from M to A, to A to T, and then to H. This will involve a bit of careful counting.\n**Important Note:** This problem is best solved using a combination of visualizing the grid and systematic counting. Be organized in your approach, and don't forget to consider all possible paths! \n",
        "Here's how we can break down the problem to find the number of distinct paths to spell \"MATH\":\n**1.  Understanding the Movement:**\n* We can only move up, down, left, or right.  This means we're essentially moving along grid lines on the $xy$-plane.\n**2.  Analyzing the Word \"MATH\":**\n* **M:** Starts at the origin (0, 0).\n* **A:**  Must be one unit away from the origin (either (1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), or (0, -1)).\n* **T:** Must be two units away from the origin in any direction.\n* **H:** Must be three units away from the origin in any direction.\n**3.  Counting the Paths:**\n* **From M to A:** There are four possible moves (up, down, left, right).\n* **From A to T:**  Let's say we moved right to get to A (1, 0). To get to T, we have two options:\n    * Move right again (2, 0)\n    * Move up (1, 1)\n    *  This pattern repeats for the other three starting A positions.  So there are 2 * 4 = 8 possible paths from A to T.\n* **From T to H:**  Let's say we moved right twice to get to T (2, 0). To get to H, we have two options:\n    * Move right again (3, 0)\n    * Move up (2, 1)\n    *  Again, this pattern repeats for the other seven starting T positions.  So there are 2 * 8 = 16 possible paths from T to H.\n**4. Total Distinct Paths:**\nTo find the total number of distinct paths, we multiply the number of possibilities at each step:\n4 * 8 * 16 = **512 distinct paths** \n",
