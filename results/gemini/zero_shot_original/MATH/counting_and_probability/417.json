        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding the Problem**\nWe need to figure out how many different ways we can arrange four \"T\" (True) and six \"F\" (False) to create answer keys.  \n**Solution**\n* **Total positions:** We have 10 statements, so there are 10 positions in our answer key.\n* **Choosing the true statements:** We need to choose 4 out of the 10 positions to be \"T\". This is a combination problem, represented by  \u00b9\u2070C\u2084 (10 choose 4).\n* **Calculating the combinations:** \n   *  \u00b9\u2070C\u2084 = 10! / (4! * 6!) = (10 * 9 * 8 * 7) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 210\n**Answer:** There are **210** distinct answer keys possible for the test. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Choosing True Statements:**\n* The teacher needs to select 4 true statements out of 10.  This is a combination problem, as the order doesn't matter.  We use the formula: \n   *  \u00b9\u2070C\u2084 = 10! / (4! * 6!) = 210\n**2.  The Rest are False:**\n* Once the 4 true statements are chosen, the remaining 6 statements automatically become false. \n**Therefore, there are 210 distinct answer keys possible for the test.** \n",

        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n* **Choosing True Statements:** The teacher needs to choose 4 true statements out of 10.  This can be done in  \u00b9\u2070C\u2084 ways, which is calculated as: 10! / (4! * 6!) = 210\n* **Choosing False Statements:** The remaining 6 statements must be false.  Since we've already chosen the true statements, there's only one way to choose the false statements.\n* **Total Answer Keys:**  To get the total number of distinct answer keys, we multiply the number of ways to choose true statements by the number of ways to choose false statements: 210 * 1 = **210**\n**Therefore, there are 210 distinct answer keys possible for this True-False test.** \n",
