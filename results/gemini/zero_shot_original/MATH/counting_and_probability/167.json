    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "When three players start, one is the alternate.  Because any of the four players might be the alternate, there are four ways to select a starting team: Lance-Sally-Joy, Lance-Sally-Fred, Lance-Joy-Fred, and Sally-Joy-Fred.  Or, we can simply note that we have $\\boxed{4}$ choices for who to leave out!",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n* **Step 1: Choosing the first starter** \n   There are 4 students who could be chosen as the first starter.\n* **Step 2: Choosing the second starter**\n   After choosing the first starter, there are only 3 students left who could be the second starter.\n* **Step 3: Choosing the third starter**\n   Now, only 2 students remain who could be the third starter.\n* **Step 4: Calculate the total possibilities**\n   To find the total number of ways to choose the three starters, we multiply the possibilities at each step: 4 * 3 * 2 = 24\n**Therefore, there are 24 different ways to choose the three starters for Ms. Hamilton's basketball team.** \n",
