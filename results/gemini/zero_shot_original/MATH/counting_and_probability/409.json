    "problem": "I have 18 distinguishable socks in my drawer: 8 white, 6 brown, and 4 blue.  In how many ways can I choose a pair of socks, provided that I get two socks of the same color?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The socks must be either both white, both brown, or both blue.  If the socks are white, there are $\\binom{8}{2} = 28$ choices.  If the socks are brown, there are $\\binom{6}{2} = 15$ choices.  If the socks are blue, there is $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ choices.  So the total number of choices for socks is $28 + 15 + 6 = \\boxed{49}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Consider each color separately:**\n* **White Socks:** You have 8 white socks, and you need to choose 2.  The number of ways to do this is 8C2 (8 choose 2), which is calculated as: 8! / (2! * 6!) = 28.\n* **Brown Socks:** You have 6 brown socks, and you need to choose 2.  The number of ways to do this is 6C2 (6 choose 2), which is calculated as: 6! / (2! * 4!) = 15.\n* **Blue Socks:** You have 4 blue socks, and you need to choose 2.  The number of ways to do this is 4C2 (4 choose 2), which is calculated as: 4! / (2! * 2!) = 6.\n**2. Add the possibilities for each color:**\nSince you can choose a pair of white, brown, or blue socks, you need to add the number of possibilities for each color: 28 + 15 + 6 = **49**\n**Therefore, there are 49 ways to choose a pair of socks of the same color.** \n",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Choosing a Color**\n* You have 3 choices for the color of the socks you want to pick: white, brown, or blue.\n**2. Choosing the First Sock**\n* Once you've chosen a color, you have several options for the first sock:\n    * White: 8 choices\n    * Brown: 6 choices\n    * Blue: 4 choices\n**3. Choosing the Second Sock**\n* After picking the first sock, you have one fewer sock of that color left. So:\n    * White: 7 choices left\n    * Brown: 5 choices left\n    * Blue: 3 choices left\n**4.  Calculating the Combinations**\n* **White:** 8 ways to choose the first sock * 7 ways to choose the second sock = 56 combinations\n* **Brown:** 6 ways to choose the first sock * 5 ways to choose the second sock = 30 combinations\n* **Blue:** 4 ways to choose the first sock * 3 ways to choose the second sock = 12 combinations\n**5. Total Combinations**\n* To get the total number of ways to choose a matching pair, add the combinations for each color: 56 + 30 + 12 = **98**\n**Therefore, there are 98 ways to choose a pair of socks of the same color.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Consider each color separately:**\n* **White Socks:** You need to choose 2 white socks out of 8. This is a combination problem, and we can calculate it as \u2078C\u2082 = 8! / (2! * 6!) = 28 ways.\n* **Brown Socks:**  You need to choose 2 brown socks out of 6. This is \u2076C\u2082 = 6! / (2! * 4!) = 15 ways.\n* **Blue Socks:** You need to choose 2 blue socks out of 4. This is \u2074C\u2082 = 4! / (2! * 2!) = 6 ways.\n**2. Add the possibilities:**\nSince you can choose a pair of white, brown, or blue socks, we add the number of ways for each color:\n28 ways (white) + 15 ways (brown) + 6 ways (blue) = **49 ways**\n**Therefore, there are 49 ways to choose a pair of socks of the same color.** \n",
