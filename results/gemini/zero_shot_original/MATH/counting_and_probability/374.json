        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**Understanding the Problem**\n* **Factorials:**  The factorial of a non-negative integer *n*, denoted by *n*!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to *n*. For example, 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.\n* **Prime Numbers:** A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 that has only two divisors: 1 and itself. Examples include 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and so on.\n**Simplifying the Expression**\nNotice that every term in the sum after the first has a factor of 2:\n* (1!) * 1 = 1 \n* (2!) * 2 = (2 * 1) * 2 = 2 * 2\n* (3!) * 3 = (3 * 2 * 1) * 3 = 2 * 3 * 3\n* ... and so on\nThis means the entire sum can be rewritten as:\n0! + 2 * (1 + 2 + 3 * 3 + 4 * 3 * 4 + ... + 50 * 49 * 50)\n**Finding the Prime Factor**\nSince the sum includes the product of many consecutive numbers, it's guaranteed to be divisible by all the prime numbers less than or equal to 50.  \n**The Largest Prime**\nThe largest prime number less than or equal to 50 is **47**.\n**Therefore, the largest prime number that divides the given quantity is 47.** \n",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**Understanding the Pattern**\nNotice that every term in the sum after the first few will be divisible by a large number. Let's examine the terms:\n* **0! = 1** \n* **(1!) \u00d7 1 = 1**\n* **(2!) \u00d7 2 = 4**\n* **(3!) \u00d7 3 = 18**\n* **(4!) \u00d7 4 = 96** \n* **(5!) \u00d7 5 = 1200** \n* **...**\nFrom the term (5!) \u00d7 5 onwards, each term will be divisible by 5!, which is equal to 120. This is because each term will contain the product of all the numbers from 1 to 5.\n**The Key Observation**\nSince all the terms after (5!) \u00d7 5 are divisible by 120, the entire sum will also be divisible by 120.  Furthermore, 120 is divisible by 5, 8, and 3, meaning our original sum is divisible by all of these prime numbers.\n**Finding the Largest Prime Factor**\nThe largest prime factor of 120 is **5**.  Since our sum is divisible by 120, it's also divisible by 5.  \n**Why 5 is the Largest**\n* **Divisibility Rule for 5:** A number is divisible by 5 if its units digit is a 0 or a 5.  \n* **The Sum's Units Digit:**  The units digit of the entire sum will be the same as the units digit of (50!) \u00d7 50.  This units digit will be a 0 (because 50! contains a factor of 10, which has a units digit of 0). \nSince the sum's units digit is 0, it's divisible by 5.  But it's not divisible by any larger prime number since the sum itself is divisible by 120, and 5 is the largest prime factor of 120.\n**Answer:** The largest prime number that divides the quantity $0! + (1!) \\times 1 + (2!) \\times 2 + (3!) \\times 3 + \\cdots + (50!) \\times 50$ is **5**. \n",
        "Here's how we can break down the problem and find the answer:\n**1. Understanding Factorials**\n* Recall that a factorial (denoted by !) means multiplying a number by all the positive integers smaller than it.  \n    * For example, 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120\n**2.

The Key Insight**\n* The key is to realize that starting from the third term, every term is a multiple of 2! (which is 2). This is because each term has a '2' within its factorial calculation.\n**4. Simplifying the Expression**\n* We can factor out a '2' from all terms starting from the third one:\n    *  1 + 1 + 2(1 + 3 * 1 + 4 * 3 * 1 + ... + 50 * 49 * 48 * ... * 3 * 1)\n**5.  Finding the Largest Prime Divisor**\n* Since the entire expression is a sum of terms that are all divisible by 2, the entire expression is also divisible by 2.\n* Furthermore, since all terms except the first two are divisible by 2, we can conclude that the expression is divisible by 2, but not by 4 (because the first two terms, '1' and '1', are not divisible by 4). \n**6. The Answer**\nTherefore, the largest prime number that divides the given expression is **2**. \n",
