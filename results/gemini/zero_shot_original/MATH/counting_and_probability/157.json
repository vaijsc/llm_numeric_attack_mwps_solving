    "solution": "Since the balls are indistinguishable, the only thing we need to keep track of is how many balls are in each box.  In this case, we can just list the cases: we put either 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 balls into the first box, and the rest into the second box.  Thus there are $\\boxed{5}$ ways to arrange 4 indistinguishable balls into 2 distinguishable boxes.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding the Problem**\n* **Indistinguishable balls:** The balls are identical, so we don't care which specific ball is in which box. \n* **Distinguishable boxes:** The boxes are different (e.g., one is red, one is blue).\n**Possible Arrangements**\nWe can think of the ways to arrange the balls as follows:\n* **4 balls in one box, 0 balls in the other:**  We can represent this as (4, 0).\n* **3 balls in one box, 1 ball in the other:** We can represent this as (3, 1).\n* **2 balls in one box, 2 balls in the other:** We can represent this as (2, 2).\n* **1 ball in one box, 3 balls in the other:** We can represent this as (1, 3).\n* **0 balls in one box, 4 balls in the other:** We can represent this as (0, 4).\n**Counting the Possibilities**\nThere are **5** distinct ways to arrange the 4 indistinguishable balls into 2 distinguishable boxes. \n",

        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding the Problem**\n* **Indistinguishable balls:** The balls are identical, so we don't care about their individual order.\n* **Distinguishable boxes:** The boxes are different (e.g., one is red, one is blue). We care which box each ball goes into.\n**Possible Arrangements**\n* **Case 1: All balls in one box:**  We have two choices (all in the first box or all in the second box).\n* **Case 2: Three balls in one box, one in the other:**  We have two choices for which box gets three balls.\n* **Case 3: Two balls in each box:** This is just one arrangement.\n**Total Ways**\nAdding up the possibilities from each case: 2 + 2 + 1 = **5**\n**Therefore, there are 5 ways to put 4 indistinguishable balls into 2 distinguishable boxes.** \n",
