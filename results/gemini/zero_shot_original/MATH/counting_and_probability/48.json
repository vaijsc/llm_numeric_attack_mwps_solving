    "solution": "The probability that at least one picture turns out is $1$ minus the probability that all the pictures do not turn out.  Since the probability that one picture will not turn out is $\\frac{4}{5}$, the probability that $n$ pictures all do not turn out is $\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^n$.  So we want\n\n$$\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^n<\\frac{1}{4}\\Rightarrow 4^{n+1}<5^n$$\n\nWe see that $4^7>5^6$, but $4^8<5^7$.  Thus the smallest allowable value of $n$ is $\\boxed{7}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Probability of NOT getting a good picture:**\n* If Trilisa has a 1/5 chance of getting a good picture, then she has a 4/5 chance of NOT getting a good picture.\n**2. Probability of NOT getting a good picture in multiple attempts:**\n* To find the probability of NOT getting a good picture in *n* attempts, we multiply the probability of not getting a good picture on each attempt together. This is (4/5)^n\n**3. Probability of getting at least one good picture:**\n* The probability of getting at least one good picture is the opposite of not getting any good pictures.  So, the probability of getting at least one good picture is 1 - (4/5)^n.\n**4. Setting up the inequality:**\n* We want this probability to be at least 3/4. So, we set up the inequality: 1 - (4/5)^n \u2265 3/4\n**5. Solving for n:**\n* Subtract 1 from both sides: -(4/5)^n \u2265 -1/4\n* Multiply both sides by -1 (and flip the inequality sign): (4/5)^n \u2264 1/4\n*  To solve for n, we need to use logarithms.  Let's take the log base (4/5) of both sides: n \u2264 log(4/5) (1/4) \n* Using a calculator, we find that log(4/5)(1/4) \u2248 3.2.  Since we need a whole number of pictures, we round up to n = 4.\n**Answer:** Trilisa needs to take at least **4** pictures to have a probability of at least 3/4 of getting at least one good picture. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Opposite**\nIt's easier to calculate the probability of Trilisa *not* getting a good picture and then subtract that from 1 to find the probability of getting at least one good picture.\n**2. Probability of Not Getting a Good Picture**\n* The probability of Trilisa *not* getting a good picture on a single attempt is 1 - (1/5) = 4/5.\n**3. Probability of Not Getting a Good Picture in Multiple Attempts**\n* To find the probability of not getting a good picture in *n* attempts, we multiply the probability of not getting a good picture on each attempt together.  This is (4/5)^n.\n**4. Setting up the Inequality**\n* We want the probability of getting at least one good picture to be at least 3/4.  This means the probability of *not* getting a good picture must be *less* than 1/4.  \n* So we have the inequality: (4/5)^n < 1/4\n**5. Solving for n**\n* To solve this, we can use logarithms:\n    * Take the logarithm of both sides (base doesn't matter, but base 10 or natural log are common): \n       log((4/5)^n) < log(1/4)\n    * Using the property of logarithms that log(a^b) = b*log(a):\n       n * log(4/5) < log(1/4)\n    * Divide both sides by log(4/5):\n       n < log(1/4) / log(4/5)\n* Using a calculator, we find that n < 6.21.\n**6. Finding the Minimum Number of Pictures**\n* Since Trilisa can't take a fraction of a picture, she needs to take at least **7 pictures** to guarantee a probability of at least 3/4 of getting at least one good picture. \n",

Probability of NOT getting a good picture**\n* If the probability of getting a good picture is 1/5, then the probability of NOT getting a good picture is 4/5.\n**2. Probability of NOT getting a good picture in multiple attempts**\n* To find the probability of not getting a good picture in *n* attempts, we multiply the probability of not getting a good picture in a single attempt by itself *n* times.  This is (4/5)^n.\n**3. Probability of getting AT LEAST one good picture**\n* The probability of getting at least one good picture is the opposite of not getting any good pictures. So, the probability of getting at least one good picture is 1 - (4/5)^n.\n**4. Setting up the inequality**\n* We want this probability to be at least 3/4: \n   1 - (4/5)^n \u2265 3/4\n**5.

However, we can estimate by trying values of *n*. \nLet's test a few values:\n* If n = 1: (4/5)^1 = 4/5 (not less than 1/4)\n* If n = 2: (4/5)^2 = 16/25 (not less than 1/4)\n* If n = 3: (4/5)^3 = 64/125 (not less than 1/4)\n* If n = 4: (4/5)^4 = 256/625 (less than 1/4)\n**6. Conclusion**\n* Trilisa needs to take at least **4 pictures** to have a probability of at least 3/4 of getting at least one good picture. \n",
