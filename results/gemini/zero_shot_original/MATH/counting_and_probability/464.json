        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand Factorials:**\n* A factorial (represented by the exclamation mark \"!\") means multiplying a number by all the positive whole numbers less than it.  \n* For example, 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120\n**2. Calculate the Factorials:**\n* 7! = 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 5040\n* 3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6\n* 4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24\n**3. Substitute and Simplify:**\n*  2 * (7! / (3! * 4!)) = 2 * (5040 / (6 * 24))\n*  = 2 * (5040 / 144)\n*  = 2 * 35\n*  = **70**\n**Therefore, the value of 2 * (7! / (3! * 4!)) is 70.** \n",
