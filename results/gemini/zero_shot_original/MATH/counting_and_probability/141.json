    "solution": "We must find the probability that Joan can solve it at any time before the sixth try, so it is the sum of the probabilities that she will solve it on her first, second, third, fourth, and fifth tries.  We could evaluate all those cases, but seeing all that casework, we wonder if it will be easier to find the probability that she fails to solve it before 6 tries, and subtract the result from 1.\n\nIn order for her to fail to solve it before her sixth try, she must fail 5 times.  The probability of failure on each try is $1 - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}$, so the probability that she fails on each of her first 5 tries is $\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^5 = \\frac{243}{1024}$.  Therefore, the probability that she succeeds before her sixth try is \\[1-\\frac{243}{1024} = \\boxed{\\frac{781}{1024}}.\\]",

        "Here's how to break down the problem:\n**1. Probability of NOT solving in one day:**\n* If she has a 1/4 chance of solving it, she has a 3/4 chance of *not* solving it.\n**2. Probability of NOT solving in six days:**\n* To not solve it in six days, she needs to fail each day.  The probability of this is: (3/4) * (3/4) * (3/4) * (3/4) * (3/4) * (3/4) = (3/4)^6\n**3. Probability of solving BEFORE the sixth try:**\n* The probability of solving before the sixth try is the opposite of not solving in six tries.  We can calculate this by: 1 - (3/4)^6\n**4. Calculation:**\n* 1 - (3/4)^6  =  1 - 0.177978515625  =  **0.822021484375**\n**Therefore, the probability that Joan will solve the problem before her sixth try is approximately 82.2%.** \n",
        "Here's how to break down the problem and find the solution:\n**1. Probability of NOT solving it on a given day:**\n* If she has a 1/4 chance of solving it, she has a 3/4 chance of *not* solving it.\n**2. Probability of NOT solving it in the first 5 days:**\n* To not solve it in 5 days, she needs to fail on each of those days: (3/4) * (3/4) * (3/4) * (3/4) * (3/4) = (3/4)^5\n**3. Probability of solving it on or before the 6th try:**\n* This is the opposite of not solving it in the first 5 days.  We can find it by subtracting the probability of not solving it from 1: \n    * 1 - (3/4)^5 \n**4. Calculating the answer:**\n* (3/4)^5 = 243/1024\n* 1 - (243/1024) = 781/1024\n**Therefore, the probability that Joan will solve the problem before her sixth try is 781/1024.** \n",
        "Here's how to break down the problem to find the probability:\n**1. Probability of NOT solving it in 6 tries:**\n* The probability of NOT solving it on a single day is 1 - (1/4) = 3/4.\n* The probability of NOT solving it in six days is (3/4) ^ 6 \n**2. Probability of solving it before the sixth try:**\n* The probability of solving it before the sixth try is the opposite of NOT solving it in six tries.\n* So, the probability is 1 - (3/4) ^ 6\n**Calculation:**\n1 - (3/4) ^ 6 = 1 - (729/4096) = **3367/4096**\n**Therefore, the probability that Joan will solve the problem before her sixth try is approximately 82.2%.** \n",
        "Here's how to break down the problem to find the probability:\n**Understanding the Problem**\n* Joan has a 1/4 chance of solving the problem each day.\n* We want the probability she solves it *before* her sixth try. This means we want to find the probability she solves it on her first, second, third, fourth, or fifth try.\n**Calculating the Probabilities**\n* **Day 1:** Probability of solving = 1/4\n* **Day 2:**  Probability of NOT solving on day 1 AND solving on day 2 = (3/4) * (1/4) \n* **Day 3:**  Probability of NOT solving on day 1, NOT solving on day 2, AND solving on day 3 = (3/4) * (3/4) * (1/4)\n* **Day 4:** Probability of NOT solving on days 1-3, AND solving on day 4 = (3/4) * (3/4) * (3/4) * (1/4)\n* **Day 5:** Probability of NOT solving on days 1-4, AND solving on day 5 = (3/4) * (3/4) * (3/4) * (3/4) * (1/4)\n**Adding the Probabilities**\nSince these events are mutually exclusive (she can't solve it on multiple days simultaneously), we add the probabilities together:\n(1/4) + (3/4)*(1/4) + (3/4)*(3/4)*(1/4) + (3/4)*(3/4)*(3/4)*(1/4) + (3/4)*(3/4)*(3/4)*(3/4)*(1/4) \n**Simplifying**\nThis is a geometric series.  We can simplify using the formula:\n*  a = first term (1/4)\n* r = common ratio (3/4)\n* n = number of terms (5)\nSum of a geometric series = a (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)\n= (1/4) (1 - (3/4)^5) / (1 - 3/4)\n= (1/4) (1 - 243/1024) / (1/4)\n= 1 - 243/1024\n= 781/1024\n**Answer:** The probability that Joan will solve the problem before her sixth try is **781/1024**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Probability of NOT solving in the first 5 tries**\n* The probability of NOT solving on a single day is 1 - (1/4) = 3/4.\n* The probability of NOT solving in 5 consecutive days is (3/4) * (3/4) * (3/4) * (3/4) * (3/4) = (3/4)^5\n**2. Probability of solving on the 6th try**\n* Since she solves on the 6th try, it means she didn't solve in the first 5 tries. \n* We already calculated the probability of NOT solving in 5 tries as (3/4)^5.\n* The probability of solving on the 6th try is then (1/4) * (3/4)^5\n**3. Probability of solving before the 6th try**\n* The probability of solving before the 6th try is the complement of NOT solving in the first 5 tries.  \n* This is 1 - (3/4)^5\n**Calculation:**\n* (3/4)^5 = 243/1024\n* 1 - (3/4)^5 = 1 - 243/1024 = 781/1024\n**Therefore, the probability that Joan will solve the problem before her sixth try is 781/1024.** \n"
