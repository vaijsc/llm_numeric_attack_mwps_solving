        "Here's how to break down the problem:\n**1. Choosing One Bank of Lights**\n* There are 8 different switches, so there are **8** ways to choose one bank of lights to be on.\n**2. Choosing Two Banks of Lights**\n* We need to figure out how many ways to choose 2 switches out of 8.  This is a combination problem (order doesn't matter).\n* The formula for combinations is: nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)\n* In our case, n = 8 (total switches) and r = 2 (switches chosen)\n* 8C2 = 8! / (2! * 6!) = (8 * 7) / (2 * 1) = 28 \n* There are **28** ways to choose two banks of lights.\n**3. Total Possibilities**\n* To find the total number of ways to have either one or two banks of lights on, we add the possibilities from each case: 8 + 28 = **36**\n**Answer:** There are 36 possible ways to set the 8 switches to have either one or two banks of lights on. \n",
        "Here's how to break down the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Lights On: One Bank**\n* There are 8 switches, so there are **8** ways to choose one switch to be on (and the rest off).\n**2. Lights On: Two Banks**\n* To choose two switches, we can think about combinations:\n    * We have 8 choices for the first switch.\n    * After choosing one, we have 7 choices left for the second switch.\n    * However, the order we choose them in doesn't matter (switch 1 then switch 2 is the same as switch 2 then switch 1). So, we need to divide by the number of ways to order two things (which is 2!).\n    * This gives us (8 * 7) / 2! = 28 ways to choose two switches. \n**3. Total Possibilities**\n* Add the number of ways to have one bank on and the number of ways to have two banks on: 8 + 28 = **36**\n**Therefore, there are 36 possible ways to set the switches so that either one or two banks of lights are on.** \n",
