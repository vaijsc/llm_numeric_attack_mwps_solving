    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The best way to do this is to find the probability that the two E's are next to each other.  There are $\\dfrac{7!}{2}$ arrangements of the word SIXTEEN.  If we want to find the number of arrangements such that the E's are next to each other, we find the number of arrangements of the six-letter word SIXT(EE)N (where we treat the two E's as a block), which is $6!$.  So the probability that an arrangement of the word SIXTEEN has the two E's next to each other is $\\dfrac{6!}{\\frac{7!}{2}} = \\dfrac{2}{7}$.  So the probability that the two E's aren't next to each other is $1 - \\dfrac{2}{7} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{7}}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Total Possible Arrangements:**\n* There are 7 letters in the word \"SIXTEEN\".\n* These letters can be arranged in 7! (7 factorial) ways, which is 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 5040.\n**2. Arrangements with the E's Together:**\n* Treat the two E's as a single unit. Now we have 6 units to arrange (S, I, X, T, N, and the EE unit). \n* These 6 units can be arranged in 6! = 720 ways.\n*  Since the two E's within the unit can swap positions, we multiply this by 2! = 2. \n* There are a total of 720 * 2 = 1440 arrangements with the E's together.\n**3. Arrangements with the E's Not Together:**\n* Subtract the arrangements with the E's together from the total number of arrangements: 5040 - 1440 = 3600.\n**4. Probability:**\n* The probability of the E's not being together is the number of arrangements where they are not together divided by the total number of arrangements: 3600 / 5040 = **3/4 or 0.75**. \n",

Now we have 6 units to arrange (S, I, X, T, N, and the EE unit). \n* These 6 units can be arranged in 6! = 720 ways.\n* Since the E's can switch places within their unit (EE or EE), we multiply by 2. So there are 720 * 2 = 1440 arrangements where the E's are together.\n**3. Arrangements Where the E's Are Not Together:**\n* Subtract the arrangements where the E's are together from the total number of arrangements: 5040 - 1440 = 3600.\n**4.
