    "problem": "License plates in the newly established state of Atlantis consist of three letters followed by three digits.  The first letter must be a vowel (y is not considered a vowel), and no letter can be repeated.

    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "First, we can count the number of ways to arrange the letters.  There are $5$ choices for the first letter, since it must be a vowel.  This leaves $25$ possibilities for the second letter, since there are no repeats, and then $24$ possibilities for the third letter, for a total of: $$5\\times25\\times24=3000\\text{ letter arrangements}$$Next, we can count the number of ways to arrange the digits.  There are $4$ possible choices for the first digit, corresponding to the four elements of the set $\\{1,2,4,6\\}$.  This leaves $9$ remaining choices for the next digit, and $8$ choices for the last digit, a total of: $$4\\times9\\times8=288\\text{ digit arrangements}$$Since the digits and letters can be arranged independently, the total number of license plates will be: $$3000\\times288=\\boxed{864000}$$",

        "Here's how to break down the problem step-by-step:\n**Step 1: Choosing the first letter**\n* There are 5 vowels (A, E, I, O, U).\n**Step 2: Choosing the second letter**\n* Since no letters can repeat, there are only 25 letters left to choose from (26 total letters minus the vowel already used).\n**Step 3: Choosing the third letter**\n* There are 24 letters left to choose from.\n**Step 4: Choosing the first digit**\n* There are 4 choices for the first digit (1, 2, 4, 6).\n**Step 5: Choosing the second digit**\n* There are 9 digits left to choose from (10 total digits minus the one already used).\n**Step 6: Choosing the third digit**\n* There are 8 digits left to choose from.\n**Step 7: Multiplying the possibilities**\nTo find the total number of possible license plates, we multiply the number of possibilities at each step:\n5 * 25 * 24 * 4 * 9 * 8 = **1,728,000**\n**Therefore, there are 1,728,000 possible license plates in Atlantis.** \n",
        "Here's how to break down the problem step-by-step to find the number of possible license plates:\n**1.  Choosing the First Letter (Vowel):**\n* There are 5 vowels: A, E, I, O, U.\n* We have 5 choices for the first letter.\n**2. Choosing the Second Letter (Consonant):**\n* After choosing a vowel, there are 25 remaining consonants.\n* We have 25 choices for the second letter.\n**3. Choosing the Third Letter (Consonant):**\n* After choosing two letters, there are 24 remaining consonants.\n* We have 24 choices for the third letter.\n**4. Choosing the First Digit (Location Code):**\n* We have 4 choices for the first digit (1, 2, 4, 6).\n**5. Choosing the Second Digit:**\n* After choosing the location code, there are 9 remaining digits.\n* We have 9 choices for the second digit.\n**6. Choosing the Third Digit:**\n* After choosing two digits, there are 8 remaining digits.\n* We have 8 choices for the third digit.\n**7. Total Number of Combinations:**\nTo find the total number of possible license plates, we multiply the number of choices at each step:\n5 choices * 25 choices * 24 choices * 4 choices * 9 choices * 8 choices = **1,728,000**\n**Therefore, there are 1,728,000 possible license plates in Atlantis.** \n",
