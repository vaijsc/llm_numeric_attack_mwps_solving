        "To get from A to C, you need to move 2 steps to the right and 2 steps up.  Think of this like a code, where \"R\" represents a step to the right and \"U\" represents a step up.  We need to find all possible combinations of \"R\" and \"U\" that have two of each.\nHere are the possibilities:\n* RRUU\n* RRUU\n* RURRU\n* RURRU\n* RRUUR\n* RRUUR\n* URURR\n* URURR\n* URRUR\n* URRUR\n* UURRR\n* UURRR\nThere are **12** possible paths from A to C. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding the Problem**\n* We need to find all possible paths from point A to point C.\n* Each step can only be \"up\" (moving one unit north) or \"right\" (moving one unit east).\n**Solution**\n1. **Total Moves:** To get from A to C, you need to move 2 units to the right and 2 units up, for a total of 4 moves.\n2. **Choosing Moves:**  Each path is determined by choosing which of the 4 moves are \"right\" moves. The other moves will automatically be \"up\" moves.\n3. **Combinations:**  This is a classic combination problem. We need to choose 2 \"right\" moves out of 4 total moves.  We can represent this mathematically as:\n   \u2074C\u2082 = 4! / (2! * 2!) = (4 * 3) / (2 * 1) = 6\n**Answer:** There are **6** different paths from A to C. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding the Problem**\nThe grid represents a path-finding problem. We need to find the number of ways to move from point A to point C, where each move can only be up or to the right.\n**Solution**\n* **Total Moves:** To get from A to C, we need to move 2 units to the right and 2 units up.  This means we need to make a total of 4 moves.\n* **Choosing the Moves:**  Each path is essentially a sequence of \"R\" (right) and \"U\" (up) moves. For example, one path could be \"RRUU\".  Since we need 4 moves, we need to choose 2 of them to be \"R\" (the rest will automatically be \"U\").\n* **Combinations:** The number of ways to choose 2 moves out of 4 is a combination, denoted as  \u2074C\u2082. \n* **Calculating the Combination:** \u2074C\u2082 = (4!)/(2!2!) = 6\n**Answer:** There are **6** paths from point A to point C. \n",

Think of each move as either \"U\" (up) or \"R\" (right).\n**Counting the Moves**\n* To reach point C, we need to move 1 unit to the right and 2 units up. \n*  This means we'll have a total of 3 moves (1 right + 2 up).\n**Arranging the Moves**\nWe have 3 moves, and need to figure out how many ways to arrange them with 2 being \"U\" and 1 being \"R\".  This is a classic combinatorics problem.\n**Solution**\nThe number of ways to arrange these moves is the same as the number of ways to choose 2 positions out of 3 for the \"U\" moves.  This is represented by the combination:\n*  \u00b3C\u2082 = 3! / (2! * 1!) = 3 \n**Therefore, there are 3 different paths from point A to point C.** \n",
