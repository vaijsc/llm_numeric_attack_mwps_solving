The car they are using has four seats: one driver's seat, one front passenger seat and two different back seats. Bonnie and Carlo are the only two who can drive the car. How many possible seating arrangements are there?",

    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are 2 choices for the driver.  The other three can seat themselves in $3\\times 2 \\times 1 = 6$ different ways. So the number of seating arrangements is $2 \\times 6 =\\boxed{12}$.",

        "Here's how to break down the problem:\n**Step 1: Choose the driver.**\n* There are two options: Bonnie or Carlo.\n**Step 2: Choose the front passenger.**\n* After choosing the driver, there are three people left who could sit in the front passenger seat.\n**Step 3: Choose the first backseat passenger.**\n*  There are two people remaining who could sit in the first backseat.\n**Step 4: Choose the second backseat passenger.**\n* Only one person is left to sit in the second backseat.\n**Calculating the total possibilities:**\nTo find the total number of seating arrangements, we multiply the number of choices at each step:\n2 choices (driver) * 3 choices (front passenger) * 2 choices (first backseat) * 1 choice (second backseat) = **12 possible seating arrangements.** \n",
        "Here's how we can break down the problem to find the number of possible seating arrangements:\n**1. Choosing the Driver:**\n* We have two options for the driver: Bonnie or Carlo.\n**2. Choosing the Front Passenger:**\n* After choosing the driver, we have three people left who could sit in the front passenger seat.\n**3. Choosing the Back Seats:**\n* Now, we have two people left to fill the two back seats. Since the back seats are different, the order we place them in matters. This means we have 2 options for the first back seat and 1 option left for the second back seat.\n**4. Calculating the Total Possibilities:**\nTo find the total number of seating arrangements, we multiply the number of options at each step:\n* 2 options (for the driver) * 3 options (for the front passenger) * 2 options (for the first back seat) * 1 option (for the second back seat) = **12 possible seating arrangements** \n",
        "Here's how we can break down the problem:\n**1. Choosing the Driver:**\n* We have two options for the driver: Bonnie or Carlo. \n**2. Choosing the Front Passenger:**\n* Once the driver is chosen, we have three people left who can sit in the front passenger seat.\n**3. Filling the Back Seats:**\n* With the driver and front passenger decided, there are two people remaining. They can sit in either of the back seats.  We don't need to distinguish between the left and right back seats since they are essentially the same.\n**Calculating the Possibilities:**\n* **Driver:** 2 options\n* **Front Passenger:** 3 options\n* **Back Seats:** 2 people can be arranged in 2! (2 factorial) ways, which is 2 * 1 = 2.\n**Total Arrangements:** To get the total number of arrangements, we multiply the possibilities for each step: 2 * 3 * 2 = **12**\n**Therefore, there are 12 possible seating arrangements.** \n",
