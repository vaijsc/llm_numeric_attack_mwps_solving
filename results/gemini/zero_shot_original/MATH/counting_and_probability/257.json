        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n1. **Place Steve:**  We can put Steve on any of the 5 spots on one team. \n2. **Place Danny:**  Since Danny must be on the opposing team, he has 5 spots available to him.\n3. **Fill the Remaining Spots:** Now we have 8 players left to fill the remaining 4 spots on each team.  The number of ways to choose 4 players out of 8 is given by the combination formula: \u2078C\u2084 = (8!)/(4!4!) = 70.\n4. **Multiply to Find Total Combinations:**  Since we have choices for Steve, Danny, and then the rest of the players, we multiply the possibilities: 5 * 5 * 70 = **1750**\n**Therefore, there are 1750 ways to divide the team into two teams of 5 if Steve and Danny insist on playing on opposing teams.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Place Steve and Danny:**\n* Since Steve and Danny must be on separate teams, we can place them first.  Let's say Steve is on Team A and Danny is on Team B.\n**2. Fill the Rest of Team A:**\n* We have 8 players left to fill the remaining 4 spots on Team A. We can choose any 4 of them.  The number of ways to do this is 8C4 (8 choose 4), which is:\n    8C4 = 8! / (4! * 4!) = 70\n**3. Fill Team B:**\n* The remaining 4 players automatically form Team B. There's only 1 way to do this since the order doesn't matter.\n**4. Account for Switching Teams:**\n*  We could have initially placed Danny on Team A and Steve on Team B.  This would lead to the same teams but in a different order.  Therefore, we must divide our previous result by 2.\n**Final Calculation:**\n* The total number of ways to divide the players into teams with Steve and Danny on opposing sides is (70 * 1) / 2 = **35** ways. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this step by step:\n1. **Place Steve:**  We can place Steve on either of the two teams. Let's say we put him on Team A.\n2. **Place Danny:**  Since Danny wants to be on the opposite team, he must go on Team B.\n3. **Fill Team A:**  We now have 3 spots left on Team A. We have 8 players remaining to choose from.  There are 8 ways to choose the first player, 7 ways to choose the second, and 6 ways to choose the third.  This seems like 8*7*6 = 336 ways, but we've overcounted. Why?  Because it doesn't matter in what order we choose these players.  To correct for overcounting, we divide by the number of ways to order 3 things (which is 3*2*1 = 6).  So there are 336/6 = 56 ways to fill the remaining spots on Team A.\n4. **Fill Team B:**  Team B is automatically filled with the remaining 5 players. \n**Therefore, there are a total of 2 * 56 = 112 ways to divide the team into two teams of 5, ensuring Steve and Danny are on opposing teams.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n1. **Fix Steve on a Team:** Since Steve and Danny must be on opposite teams, let's start by placing Steve on Team A.  \n2. **Place Danny:** Now we need to place Danny on Team B. There's only **1** way to do this (he has to be on the opposite team from Steve).\n3. **Fill Team A:** We have 8 players left to fill the remaining 4 spots on Team A.  We can choose any 4 of these 8 players, which can be done in  \u2078C\u2084 ways (8 choose 4). This is calculated as: \u2078C\u2084 = 8! / (4! * 4!) = 70 ways.\n4. **Team B is Automatic:** Once we've chosen the 4 players for Team A, the remaining 4 players automatically form Team B. \n5. **Total Combinations:**  To get the total number of ways to divide the team, we multiply the possibilities for each step: 1 * 70 = **70 ways**.\n**Therefore, there are 70 ways to divide the team into two teams of 5 if Steve and Danny insist on playing on opposing teams.** \n",

We can choose 4 players out of 8 to be on the same team as Steve in  \u2078C\u2084 ways (8 choose 4), which is 70 ways. \n4. **The other team is automatic:** Once we've chosen the 4 players for Steve's team, the remaining 4 players automatically form the other team.\n**Therefore, there are 70 ways to divide the team into two teams of 5 if Steve and Danny insist on playing on opposing teams.** \n"
