        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Total Arrangements Without Restrictions:**\n* Imagine the beads are numbered 1 through 6.\n* For the first position in the grid, we have 6 choices.\n* For the second position, we have 5 choices left.\n* This continues until we have only 1 choice left for the last position.\n* So, there are  6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720 total arrangements if we don't consider rotations or reflections.\n**2. Accounting for Rotations:**\n* We need to divide by the number of rotations that result in the same arrangement.\n* A 2x3 grid can be rotated 180 degrees to get the same arrangement. This means each unique arrangement has been counted twice. \n* So, we divide the total number of arrangements by 2: 720 / 2 = 360\n**3. Accounting for Reflections:**\n*  We can reflect a 2x3 grid across a vertical axis. This also creates duplicate arrangements.\n* However, we've already accounted for the 180-degree rotation, which is equivalent to reflecting twice. \n* Therefore, we've already addressed reflections in our calculations.\n**Answer:** There are **360** unique ways to arrange the beads in a 2x3 grid when considering rotations and reflections as equivalent. \n",
        "Here's a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n**1. Total Arrangements without Restrictions**\n* Imagine the grid as 6 slots.  For the first slot, we have 6 choices of beads. For the second slot, we have 5 choices left, and so on.\n* This gives us a total of 6! = 720 ways to arrange the beads without any restrictions.\n**2. Accounting for Rotations**\n* **Rotation by 90 degrees:**  Rotating the grid by 90 degrees creates a new arrangement, but we want to consider it the same.  This means each distinct arrangement has 4 rotations that are considered identical (original, 90 degrees, 180 degrees, 270 degrees).\n* **Rotation by 180 degrees:** We've already accounted for this rotation in the 90-degree rotations.\n**3. Accounting for Reflections**\n* **Reflection across a horizontal or vertical axis:** Each arrangement has two reflections that are considered identical. We haven't accounted for these yet.\n**4. Calculating the Number of Distinct Arrangements**\n* We've overcounted by a factor of 4 (rotations) and 2 (reflections), giving us a total overcount of 8.\n* Divide the original number of arrangements by 8 to get the number of distinct arrangements: 720 / 8 = **90**\n**Therefore, there are 90 distinct ways to arrange the 6 beads in a 2 x 3 grid.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Total Possible Arrangements:**\n* If we didn't consider rotations and reflections, we'd have 6 choices for the first bead, 5 choices for the second, and so on.  This gives us a total of 6! = 720 possible arrangements.\n**2. Accounting for Rotations:**\n* Imagine fixing one bead in a specific spot.  There are 4 possible rotations of the grid, each leading to a different arrangement if rotations are considered distinct. \n* However, we want to count these rotations as the same arrangement. So, we need to divide the total number of arrangements by 4 to account for rotations.  This gives us 720 / 4 = 180 arrangements.\n**3. Accounting for Reflections:**\n* There are two types of reflections we need to consider:\n    * **Horizontal Reflection:**  Flipping the grid across its middle row.\n    * **Vertical Reflection:** Flipping the grid across its middle column.\n*  We've already accounted for horizontal reflections in step 2.  Why? Because rotating the grid by 180 degrees is the same as reflecting it horizontally.\n*  We still need to account for vertical reflections.  For each arrangement, there's one corresponding arrangement obtained by a vertical reflection.  Therefore, we need to divide our current count by 2. This gives us 180 / 2 = 90 arrangements.\n**Therefore, there are 90 distinct arrangements of the beads in a 2x3 grid when rotations and reflections are considered the same.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Total Arrangements Without Restrictions:**\n*  Imagine the beads are numbered 1 through 6.\n*  For the first spot in the grid, we have 6 choices.\n*  For the second spot, we have 5 choices left.\n*  Continuing in this way, we get a total of 6! = 720 possible arrangements.\n**2. Accounting for Rotations:**\n*  If we fix one bead, there are 3 possible rotations that produce the same arrangement (a 120-degree rotation, a 240-degree rotation, and a full 360-degree rotation).\n*  Therefore, we've overcounted each distinct arrangement 3 times due to rotations.\n**3. Accounting for Reflections:**\n*  There's one reflection that we need to account for (a reflection across the vertical line down the center of the grid). \n*  This reflection is already covered in the rotations we considered in step 2. If we rotate an arrangement 180 degrees, it's equivalent to reflecting it. \n**4. Finding the Final Count:**\n*  We divide the number of unconstrained arrangements by the number of times we've overcounted each arrangement: 720 / 3 = **240**.\n**Therefore, there are 240 distinct ways to arrange the beads in a 2x3 grid.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Total Arrangements Without Restrictions**\n*  We have 6 distinct beads, and 6 positions to fill in the grid. \n*  The first position can be filled in 6 ways, the second in 5 ways, and so on.\n*  Therefore, there are 6! = 720 ways to arrange the beads without any restrictions.\n**2.  Identifying Equivalent Arrangements**\n* **Rotations:**  A 2x3 grid can be rotated 4 times (0\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 180\u00b0, 270\u00b0) to obtain different orientations, but these are considered the same arrangement.\n* **Reflections:** A 2x3 grid can be reflected across its horizontal or vertical axis, creating two more arrangements that are considered equivalent to the original.\n**3.  Counting the Number of Unique Arrangements**\n* **Total Arrangements:** 720\n* **Rotational Equivalences:**  Each unique arrangement has 4 equivalent rotations (including the original).\n* **Reflective Equivalences:**  Each unique arrangement also has 2 equivalent reflections (including the original).\n* **Overcounting:** We've overcounted each unique arrangement 4 * 2 = 8 times. \n**4.  Finding the Unique Arrangements**\nTo find the number of truly unique arrangements, we divide the total number of arrangements by the overcounting factor:\nNumber of unique arrangements = 720 / 8 = **90**\n**Therefore, there are 90 ways to arrange the 6 beads in a 2x3 grid if reflections and rotations are considered the same.** \n"
