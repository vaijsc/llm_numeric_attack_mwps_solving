    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "It must either rain tomorrow or not rain tomorrow, so the sum of the probability that it rains and the probability it doesn't rain is 1.  Therefore, the probability it doesn't rain is $1 - \\frac{1}{11} = \\boxed{\\frac{10}{11}}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n* **Understanding the concept:** The probability of an event happening and the probability of it not happening always add up to 1 (or 100%).\n* **Applying the concept:**  \n    * If the probability of rain is 1/11, then the probability of it *not* raining is: \n    * 1 - (1/11) = 10/11\n* **Answer:** The probability that it will not rain tomorrow is **10/11**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n* **Understanding Probability:**  The probability of an event happening is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n* **Complementary Events:**  The probability of an event happening plus the probability of it not happening always equals 1 (or 100%).  Raining and not raining are complementary events.\n* **Calculation:**\n    * If the probability of rain is 1/11, then the probability of it not raining is: \n    * 1 - (1/11) = 10/11\n**Answer:** The probability that it will not rain tomorrow is **10/11**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n* **Understanding Probability:** Probability is the chance of something happening. The total probability of all possible outcomes is always 1 (or 100%).\n* **Complementary Events:**  The event \"rain tomorrow\" and the event \"no rain tomorrow\" are complementary events. This means they cover all possibilities and don't overlap.\n* **Finding the Complement:**  To find the probability of the event \"no rain tomorrow,\" subtract the probability of \"rain tomorrow\" from 1.\n**Calculation:**\nProbability of no rain = 1 - Probability of rain \n                           = 1 - (1/11)\n                           = 10/11\n**Answer:** The probability that it will not rain tomorrow is **10/11**. \n",
