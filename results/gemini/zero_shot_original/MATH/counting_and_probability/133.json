    "solution": "The first four primes are 2, 3, 5, and 7. The only way for the sum of the numbers Bob gets to not be greater than 0 is if he gets a 0 each time he plays the game. The chance that Bob will get a 0 each time he plays is $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{5} \\cdot \\frac{1}{7}=\\frac{1}{210}$. Therefore, the probability that Bob will not get all 0's is $1-\\frac{1}{210}=\\boxed{\\frac{209}{210}}$.",

        "Here's how to break down the problem and find the solution:\n**1. Identify the Prime Numbers**\nThe first four prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n**2. Probability of Getting Zero on Each Number**\n* For 2: There's 1 favorable outcome (getting 0) out of 2 possible outcomes (0 or 1). Probability = 1/2.\n* For 3: There's 1 favorable outcome (getting 0) out of 3 possible outcomes (0, 1, or 2). Probability = 1/3.\n* For 5: There's 1 favorable outcome (getting 0) out of 5 possible outcomes. Probability = 1/5.\n* For 7: There's 1 favorable outcome (getting 0) out of 7 possible outcomes. Probability = 1/7.\n**3. Probability of Getting Zero on All Four Numbers**\nTo get a sum of 0, Bob needs to get 0 on each of the four prime numbers. We multiply the probabilities together:\n(1/2) * (1/3) * (1/5) * (1/7) = 1/210\n**4. Probability of Getting a Sum Greater Than Zero**\nThe probability of the sum being greater than 0 is the opposite (complement) of getting a sum of 0. \nProbability (Sum > 0) = 1 - Probability (Sum = 0) = 1 - (1/210) = 209/210\n**Answer:** The probability that the sum of the numbers Bob gets is greater than 0 is **209/210**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step by step:\n**1. Identify the Prime Numbers:**\n* The first four prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n**2. Calculate the Probability of Getting 0 for Each Prime:**\n* For 2:  There's only one way to get 0 (choosing 0). There are two possibilities (0 or 1).  Probability = 1/2.\n* For 3: There's one way to get 0 (choosing 0) out of three possibilities. Probability = 1/3.\n* For 5: There's one way to get 0 (choosing 0) out of five possibilities. Probability = 1/5.\n* For 7: There's one way to get 0 (choosing 0) out of seven possibilities. Probability = 1/7.\n**3. Calculate the Probability of Getting 0 in All Four Games:**\nTo get a sum of 0, Bob needs to get 0 in each of the four games.  We multiply the probabilities:\n(1/2) * (1/3) * (1/5) * (1/7) = 1/210\n**4. Calculate the Probability of Not Getting a Sum of 0:**\nThis is the opposite of getting a sum of 0.  \nProbability (Sum > 0) = 1 - Probability (Sum = 0)\nProbability (Sum > 0) = 1 - (1/210) = 209/210\n**Answer:** The probability that the sum of the numbers Bob gets is greater than 0 is **209/210**. \n",

Determine the Probability of Getting 0 for Each Prime**\n* For 2:  There's only one way to get 0 (choosing 0 itself), and two possibilities (0 or 1). So the probability is 1/2.\n* For 3:  There's one way to get 0, and three possibilities (0, 1, or 2). The probability is 1/3.\n* For 5:  There's one way to get 0, and five possibilities. The probability is 1/5.\n* For 7:  There's one way to get 0, and seven possibilities. The probability is 1/7.\n**3. Find the Probability of Getting 0 on All Four Rolls**\nTo get a sum greater than 0, Bob cannot get 0 on all four rolls. The probability of getting 0 on all four rolls is:\n(1/2) * (1/3) * (1/5) * (1/7) = 1/210\n**4. Calculate the Probability of a Sum Greater than 0**\nThe probability of the sum being greater than 0 is the complement of getting 0 on all four rolls:\n1 - (1/210) = 209/210\n**Therefore, the probability that the sum of the numbers Bob gets is greater than 0 is 209/210.** \n",
