    "solution": "Note that there are $4! = 24$ numbers ending in 1, since we have 4 choices for the 10s digit, 3 choices for the 100s digit, 2 choices for the 1000s digit, and 1 choice for the remaining digit.  Thus there are also 24 numbers ending in each of 3, 4, 5, 9, and the total contribution of ones digits to the sum is $24 (1 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 9) = 528$.  But we can make a similar argument about the contribution of the digits in the other places (10s, 100s, etc.), so our total sum is $528 + 5280 + \\ldots + 5280000 = 528 (1 + 10 + \\ldots + 10000) = 528\\cdot 11,111 = \\boxed{5,\\!866,\\!608}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1.  Understanding the Problem**\nCamy is creating all possible five-digit numbers using the digits 1, 3, 4, 5, and 9. Since each digit is used only once in each number, we're dealing with permutations.\n**2. Calculating the Number of Permutations**\n* There are 5 choices for the first digit.\n* Once the first digit is chosen, there are 4 choices left for the second digit.\n* This continues until there's only 1 choice left for the last digit.\nSo, the total number of possible numbers is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120\n**3.  The Key Insight**\nNotice that each of the digits 1, 3, 4, 5, and 9 appears in each place value (ten thousands, thousands, hundreds, tens, and units) the same number of times.  This is because every possible arrangement is included in the list.\n**4.  Calculating the Sum**\n* **Units Place:** The sum of the digits in the units place is 120 (1 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 9) * 24.  (The 24 comes from the fact that each digit appears in the units place 24 times \u2013 120 total numbers / 5 digits).\n* **Tens Place:**  The sum of the digits in the tens place is also 120 * 24.\n* **Hundreds Place, Thousands Place, Ten Thousands Place:**  The same logic applies to the other place values.\n**5.  Final Calculation**\n* Total sum = (120 * 24) * (1 + 10 + 100 + 1000 + 10000) \n* Total sum = 2880 * 11111\n* Total sum = **31,999,680**\n**Therefore, the sum of all the five-digit integers Camy can form is 31,999,680.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1.  Understanding the Problem**\nCamy is creating five-digit numbers using the digits 1, 3, 4, 5, and 9. Each digit must be used exactly once in each number. We need to find the sum of all these possible numbers.\n**2.  Counting the Possibilities**\n* **Place Value:** Since we're dealing with five-digit numbers, each digit has a specific place value: ten thousands, thousands, hundreds, tens, and ones.\n* **Permutations:**  For the ten-thousands place, we have 5 choices (any of the digits). Once we've chosen a digit for the ten-thousands place, we only have 4 choices left for the thousands place, and so on.  This is a permutation problem.\nThe total number of possible numbers is 5! (5 factorial) which is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.\n**3.  Finding the Sum**\n* **Symmetry:** Notice that for every number in the list, there's a corresponding number with the digits reversed. For example, if 13459 is on the list, so is 95431.  These pairs will have the same sum of digits.\n* **Digit Sums:**  The sum of the digits 1, 3, 4, 5, and 9 is 1 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 9 = 22.\n* **Place Value:**  Since each digit appears in each place value an equal number of times, the sum of the digits in each place value will be the same (22).\n**4.  Calculation**\n* **Place Value Sums:** The sum of the numbers in the ten-thousands place will be 22 * 10000 = 220000.  Similarly, the sums for the thousands, hundreds, tens, and ones places will be 22000, 2200, 220, and 22, respectively. \n* **Total Sum:**  To find the total sum of all the numbers, add up the sums from each place value: 220000 + 22000 + 2200 + 220 + 22 = **244242**\n**Therefore, the sum of the integers on Camy's list is 244,242.** \n",

(5 factorial) ways to arrange them, which is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.  This means there are 120 numbers on Camy's list.\n2. **Symmetry and the Sum:**  Notice that each digit appears in each of the five positions (thousands, hundreds, tens, ones) an equal number of times.  This means the sum of the digits in the thousands place will be the same as the sum of the digits in the hundreds place, and so on.\n3. **Calculate the Sum of Each Digit:**  \n   * The sum of the digits 1, 3, 4, 5, and 9 is 1 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 9 = 22.\n4. **The Sum of All the Numbers:** Since each digit appears 120/5 = 24 times in each place value, the sum of the numbers on Camy's list is:\n   * 22 (sum of digits) * 24 (times each digit appears in each place) * 11111 (value of each place) = **5,866,664**\n**Therefore, the sum of the integers on Camy's list is 5,866,664.** \n",

Finding the Sum**\nInstead of calculating the sum of all 120 numbers directly, we can use a clever trick.  Let's consider the sum of all the digits in the ten thousands place:\n* 1 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 9 = 22 \nSince each digit appears in the ten thousands place 24 times (120 total numbers / 5 digits), the sum of all the ten thousands digits is 22 * 24.\nWe can apply the same logic to the other place values:\n* Thousands place: 22 * 24 \n* Hundreds place: 22 * 24\n* Tens place: 22 * 24\n* Units place: 22 * 24\nTherefore, the sum of all the five-digit numbers is:\n(22 * 24) * 10000 + (22 * 24) * 1000 + (22 * 24) * 100 + (22 * 24) * 10 + (22 * 24) \nThis simplifies to:\n(22 * 24) * (10000 + 1000 + 100 + 10 + 1) = (22 * 24) * 11111 \n**4.
