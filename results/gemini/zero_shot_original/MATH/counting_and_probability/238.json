    "problem": "An envelope contains eight bills: 2 ones, 2 fives, 2 tens, and 2 twenties. Two bills are drawn at random without replacement. What is the probability that their sum is $\\$20$ or more?",

    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are \\[\n\\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8!}{6!\\cdot 2!} = 28\n\\]ways to choose the bills. A sum of at least $\\$20$ is obtained by choosing  both $\\$20$ bills, one of the  $\\$20$ bills and one of the six smaller bills, or both $\\$10$ bills.   Hence the probability is \\[\n\\frac{ 1 + 2\\cdot 6 + 1}{28}=\\frac{14}{28}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}.\n\\]",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Figure out the possible combinations that result in a sum of $20 or more:**\n* **Two twenties:** This is the only way to get exactly $40.\n* **One twenty and one ten:**  This adds up to $30.\n* **One twenty and one five:** This adds up to $25.\n**2. Calculate the probability of each combination:**\n* **Two twenties:**\n    * Probability of drawing one twenty: 2/8 (since there are 2 twenties out of 8 bills)\n    * Probability of drawing another twenty after taking out the first: 1/7 (since there's one twenty left out of 7 bills)\n    * Probability of drawing two twenties: (2/8) * (1/7) = 1/28\n* **One twenty and one ten:**\n    * Probability of drawing a twenty: 2/8\n    * Probability of drawing a ten after taking out the twenty: 2/7 \n    * Probability of drawing one twenty and one ten (in either order): (2/8) * (2/7) * 2 = 1/14 (we multiply by 2 because we could draw the ten first then the twenty)\n* **One twenty and one five:**\n    * Probability of drawing a twenty: 2/8\n    * Probability of drawing a five after taking out the twenty: 2/7\n    * Probability of drawing one twenty and one five (in either order): (2/8) * (2/7) * 2 = 1/14\n**3. Add the probabilities of each successful combination:**\nTotal probability = (1/28) + (1/14) + (1/14) = 5/28\n**Therefore, the probability of drawing two bills that sum to $20 or more is 5/28.** \n",
