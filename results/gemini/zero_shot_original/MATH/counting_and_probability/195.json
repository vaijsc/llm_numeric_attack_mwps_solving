        "Here's how to find the next number in the row of Pascal's Triangle that starts with 1 and then 10:\n**Understanding Pascal's Triangle**\n* **Each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.** \n* **The outer edges of the triangle are always 1.**\n**Finding the Next Number**\n1. **The row starts with 1 and then 10.**  This means the two numbers above the 10 must have been 1 and 9 (since 1 + 9 = 10).\n2. **To find the number after the 10, we look at the two numbers above it.**  We know one is 9, and the other is the number to the left of the 1, which is also 1.\n3. **The sum of 9 and 1 is 10.**\n**Therefore, the next number in the row is 10.** \n",
        "Here's how to find the next number:\n**Understanding Pascal's Triangle**\n* Each number in Pascal's Triangle is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.\n* The first and last numbers in each row are always 1.\n**Finding the Next Number**\n1. **Identify the numbers above:** The row starts with 1 and 10.  To find the next number, we need the two numbers above the 10.\n2. **Think about the previous row:** The numbers above the 10 are the last two numbers in the previous row. Since the first number in a row is always 1, the previous row ends with 1.\n3. **Calculate the sum:** The two numbers above the 10 are 1 and 10.  Their sum is 1 + 10 = 11.\n**Therefore, the next number in the row is 11.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this:\n* **Understanding Pascal's Triangle:**  Each number in Pascal's Triangle is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. \n* **Finding the Next Number:** \n   - Since the row starts with 1 and then 10, the next number is found by adding those two together: 1 + 10 = 11.\n**Therefore, the next number in the row is 11.** \n",
