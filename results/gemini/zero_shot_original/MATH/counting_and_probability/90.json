    "problem": "My state's lottery has 30 white balls numbered from 1 through 30 and 20 red balls numbered from 1 through 20.  In each lottery drawing, 3 of the white balls and 2 of the red balls are drawn.  To win, you must match all 3 white balls and both red balls, without regard to the order in which they were drawn.  How many possible different combinations may be drawn?",

    "solution": "There are 30 ways to draw the first white ball, 29 ways to draw the second, and 28 ways to draw the third.  However, since order doesn't matter, we must divide by $3!$ to get $\\dfrac{30 \\times 29 \\times 28}{3!} = 4060$ ways to draw three white balls.  There are 20 ways to draw the first red ball and 19 ways to draw the second, however, since order doesn't matter, we must divide by $2!$ to get $\\dfrac{20 \\times 19}{2!} = 190$ ways to draw two red balls.  So the total number of outcomes for both the red and the white balls is $4060 \\times 190 = \\boxed{771,\\!400}$.",

        "Here's how to break down the calculation for the number of possible lottery combinations:\n**1. Combinations of White Balls:**\n* We need to choose 3 white balls out of 30.  This is a combination problem (order doesn't matter).\n* The formula for combinations is nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!), where n is the total number of items and r is the number you choose.\n* So, for white balls: 30C3 = 30! / (3! * 27!) = (30 * 29 * 28) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 4060\n**2. Combinations of Red Balls:**\n* We need to choose 2 red balls out of 20.\n* Using the combination formula: 20C2 = 20! / (2! * 18!) = (20 * 19) / (2 * 1) = 190\n**3. Total Combinations:**\n* To get the total number of possible lottery combinations, we multiply the number of white ball combinations by the number of red ball combinations.\n* Total Combinations = 4060 * 190 = 771,400\n**Therefore, there are 771,400 possible different combinations that may be drawn in this lottery.** \n",
        "Here's how to break down the calculation to find the number of possible combinations:\n**1. Combinations of White Balls**\n* We need to choose 3 white balls out of 30. \n* This is a combination problem, as the order we pick the balls doesn't matter.\n* The formula for combinations is:  nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)\n* In our case, n = 30 (total white balls) and r = 3 (balls we need to choose)\n* So, the number of combinations of white balls is: 30C3 = 30! / (3! * 27!) = 4060\n**2. Combinations of Red Balls**\n* We need to choose 2 red balls out of 20.\n* Using the same combination formula: 20C2 = 20! / (2! * 18!) = 190\n**3. Total Combinations**\n* To get the total number of possible lottery combinations, we multiply the number of white ball combinations by the number of red ball combinations.\n* Total combinations = 4060 * 190 = 771,400\n**Therefore, there are 771,400 possible different combinations in your state's lottery.** \n",
