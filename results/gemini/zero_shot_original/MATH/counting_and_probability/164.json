        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Ratio:**\n* The ratio of losses to wins is 7:13.  This means for every 7 losses, the team has 13 wins.\n**2. Total Games:**\n*  The total number of games represented in the ratio is 7 (losses) + 13 (wins) = 20 games.\n**3. Probability of Winning:**\n* The probability of winning is the number of wins divided by the total number of games: 13 wins / 20 games = 0.65\n**4. Convert to Percentage:**\n* Multiply the probability by 100%: 0.65 * 100% = 65%\n**Answer:** The probability that the team will win its next game is **65%**. \n",
