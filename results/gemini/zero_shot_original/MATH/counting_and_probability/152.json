        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Analyze the Wheel:**\n* The wheel has 9 numbers.\n* Each number has an equal probability of being selected.\n**2.  Analyze the Checkerboard:**\n* The checkerboard has 12 shaded squares and 12 unshaded squares.\n**3.  Determine Possible Outcomes:**\n* **Dividing by 4:**  When dividing a number by 4, you can get a remainder of 1, 2, or 3. This determines the column on the checkerboard. \n* **Dividing by 5:** When dividing a number by 5, you can get a remainder of 1, 2, 3, or 4. This determines the row on the checkerboard.\n**4.  Calculate the Probability:**\n* **Count favorable outcomes:** \n   * For each of the 3 possible remainders when dividing by 4, there are 4 possible remainders when dividing by 5. This gives us 3 * 4 = 12 possible combinations that land on a shaded square.\n* **Count total outcomes:**  There are 9 numbers on the wheel, and we spin it twice. This gives us 9 * 9 = 81 possible combinations.\n* **Probability:** The probability of landing on a shaded square is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes: 12/81 = 4/27\n**Therefore, the probability that the checker is placed on a shaded square of the checkerboard is 4/27.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Analyze the Wheel and Checkerboard**\n* **Wheel:**  The wheel has 9 equally likely outcomes.\n* **Checkerboard:**  The checkerboard has 12 shaded squares and 12 unshaded squares.\n**2. Determine the Probability of Landing on a Shaded Square**\n* **Column:**  The first spin determines the column. Notice that the wheel has:\n    * 3 numbers divisible by 4 (1, 4, 8) resulting in a remainder of 1 (shaded column).\n    * 3 numbers that leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 4 (2, 5, 9) (shaded column).\n    * 3 numbers that leave a remainder of 3 when divided by 4 (3, 6, 7) (unshaded column).\n    * Therefore, the probability of landing in a shaded column is 6/9 = 2/3.\n* **Row:** The second spin determines the row. Similarly:\n    * 2 numbers are divisible by 5 (5, 10) resulting in a remainder of 1 (unshaded row).\n    * 2 numbers leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 5 (2, 7) (unshaded row).\n    * 2 numbers leave a remainder of 3 when divided by 5 (3, 8) (shaded row).\n    * 2 numbers leave a remainder of 4 when divided by 5 (4, 9) (shaded row).\n    * Therefore, the probability of landing in a shaded row is 4/5.\n**3. Calculate the Overall Probability**\nSince the spins are independent events, we multiply the probabilities of landing in a shaded column and a shaded row:\n(2/3) * (4/5) = **8/15**\n**Answer:** The probability that the checker is placed on a shaded square of the checkerboard is **8/15**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Analyze the Wheel and Checkerboard**\n* **Wheel:** The wheel has 9 equally likely numbers.\n* **Checkerboard:**  The checkerboard is 4 rows by 3 columns, with alternating shaded squares. \n**2. Determine Possible Outcomes**\n* **First Spin (Column):**  Dividing the numbers on the wheel by 4 gives these remainders:\n    * 1: {1, 5, 9}\n    * 2: {2, 6}\n    * 3: {3, 7} \n* **Second Spin (Row):** Dividing the numbers on the wheel by 5 gives these remainders:\n    * 1: {1, 6}\n    * 2: {2, 7}\n    * 3: {3, 8}\n    * 4: {4, 9}\n**3. Identify Favorable Outcomes (Shaded Squares)**\n* Notice that the checkerboard has a repeating pattern:  every other square is shaded. \n* To land on a shaded square, the column and row remainders need to add up to an **odd** number.  \n**4. Count Favorable Outcomes**\nLet's list the possible combinations that result in a shaded square:\n* **Column 1 (Remainder 1):**\n    * 1, 1 (shaded)\n    * 1, 3 (shaded)\n    * 1, 4 (shaded)\n    * 5, 1 (shaded)\n    * 5, 3 (shaded)\n    * 5, 4 (shaded)\n    * 9, 1 (shaded)\n    * 9, 3 (shaded)\n    * 9, 4 (shaded)\n* **Column 2 (Remainder 2):**\n    * 2, 2 (shaded)\n    * 2, 4 (shaded)\n    * 6, 2 (shaded)\n    * 6, 4 (shaded)\n* **Column 3 (Remainder 3):**\n    * 3, 1 (shaded)\n    * 3, 3 (shaded)\n    * 3, 4 (shaded)\n    * 7, 1 (shaded)\n    * 7, 3 (shaded)\n    * 7, 4 (shaded)\n**5. Calculate the Probability**\n* **Total Possible Outcomes:** 9 numbers on the wheel for the first spin * 9 numbers on the wheel for the second spin = 81 total possibilities\n* **Favorable Outcomes:** 21 combinations land on a shaded square.\n* **Probability:** (Favorable Outcomes) / (Total Possible Outcomes) = 21/81 = **7/27**\n**Therefore, the probability that the checker is placed on a shaded square is 7/27.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Possible Outcomes**\n* **Wheel 1:**  The first spin has 9 possible outcomes (numbers 1 through 9).\n* **Wheel 2:** The second spin also has 9 possible outcomes.\n* **Total Outcomes:**  This gives us a total of 9 * 9 = 81 possible combinations of outcomes from the two spins.\n**2. Shaded Squares**\n* **Checkerboard Pattern:** The checkerboard has an alternating pattern of shaded and unshaded squares. \n* **Shaded Squares:** There are 18 shaded squares on the checkerboard.\n**3. Analyzing the Remainders**\n* **Column:**  Dividing the first number by 4 gives us remainders of 1, 2, or 3, which determine the columns.\n* **Row:** Dividing the second number by 5 gives us remainders of 1, 2, 3, or 4, which determine the rows.\n**4. Finding Favorable Outcomes**\nTo find the probability of landing on a shaded square, we need to figure out how many of the 81 possible combinations result in landing on a shaded square. Let's examine the remainders and their corresponding squares:\n* **Remainder 1 (Column 1):**  The checker will land on a shaded square if the remainder from dividing the second number by 5 is 1, 3.\n* **Remainder 2 (Column 2):** The checker will land on a shaded square if the remainder from dividing the second number by 5 is 2, 4.\n* **Remainder 3 (Column 3):** The checker will land on a shaded square if the remainder from dividing the second number by 5 is 1, 3.\n**5. Calculating the Probability**\n* **Favorable Combinations:** Let's count how many combinations lead to a shaded square:\n    * For each column, there are 2 favorable remainders for the second number.\n    * There are 3 columns.\n    * This means there are 2 * 3 = 6 favorable outcomes for each of the 9 possible first numbers. \n    * In total, there are 6 * 9 = 54 favorable outcomes.\n* **Probability:** The probability of landing on a shaded square is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes: 54/81 = **2/3**.\n**Therefore, the probability that the checker is placed on a shaded square of the checkerboard is 2/3.** \n",
        "Here's a step-by-step solution:\n**1. Possible Outcomes for the Spin:**\n* **Spin 1:** The wheel has 6 equally likely numbers (1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9).\n* **Spin 2:**  The wheel has 6 equally likely numbers (1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9). \n* **Total Possible Outcomes:**  6 * 6 = 36 \n**2. Shaded Squares:**\n* The checkerboard has 12 shaded squares.\n**3.  Determining the Checker's Position:**\n* **Column:** The first spin determines the column based on the remainder when divided by 4:\n    * 1 (remainder 1)\n    * 2 (remainder 2)\n    * 3 (remainder 3)\n    * 6 (remainder 2)\n    * 7 (remainder 3)\n    * 9 (remainder 1)\n* **Row:** The second spin determines the row based on the remainder when divided by 5:\n    * 1 (remainder 1)\n    * 2 (remainder 2)\n    * 3 (remainder 3)\n    * 6 (remainder 1)\n    * 7 (remainder 2)\n    * 9 (remainder 4)\n**4. Finding Favorable Outcomes:**\nWe need to count the outcomes that result in the checker landing on a shaded square.  Let's analyze the possible remainders:\n* **Remainder 1 (Column):**  Can be combined with remainders 1, 3, and 4 (row) to land on a shaded square.\n* **Remainder 2 (Column):** Can be combined with remainders 2 and 4 (row) to land on a shaded square.\n* **Remainder 3 (Column):**  Can be combined with remainders 1, 3, and 4 (row) to land on a shaded square.\n**5. Calculating the Probability:**\n* **Favorable Outcomes:**  There are 9 combinations that result in a shaded square (3 for each column).\n* **Probability:** (Favorable Outcomes) / (Total Outcomes) = 9 / 36 = **1/4**\n**Therefore, the probability that the checker is placed on a shaded square of the checkerboard is 1/4.** \n"
