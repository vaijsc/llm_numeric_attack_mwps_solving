        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding Divisors**\n* **Factors (or divisors) come in pairs:** If 'a' is a divisor of a number 'n', then 'n/a' is also a divisor of 'n'. \n* **Perfect Squares:** The only time a divisor doesn't have a pair is when it's the square root of the number. For example, the divisors of 9 are 1, 3, and 9 (3 is paired with itself).\n**Strategy**\n1. **Count the odd numbers:** Since we want an *even* number of divisors, we need to exclude numbers that have an *odd* number of divisors.  Numbers with an odd number of divisors are perfect squares.\n2. **List the perfect squares:** Find all the perfect squares less than 2008: 1, 4, 9, 16, ..., 44\u00b2 = 1936.\n3. **Calculate the difference:** Subtract the number of perfect squares from the total number of integers less than 2008.\n**Calculations**\n* **Total integers:**  There are 2007 positive integers less than 2008.\n* **Perfect squares:** The largest perfect square less than 2008 is 44\u00b2, so there are 44 perfect squares.\n**Final Answer:**\n2007 - 44 = **1963** positive integers less than 2008 have an even number of divisors. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding Divisors**\n* **Pairs of divisors:** Every divisor of a number has a corresponding \"pair\" that multiplies to give the number. For example, the divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. Notice they come in pairs: (1, 12), (2, 6), (3, 4).\n* **Perfect Squares:**  The only numbers that don't have divisors in pairs are perfect squares.  A perfect square has one divisor that is its own square root. For example, the divisors of 9 are 1, 3, and 9.\n**The Key Insight**\nA number has an even number of divisors if and only if it is *not* a perfect square. \n**Counting the Perfect Squares**\nTo find how many perfect squares are less than 2008, we find the largest perfect square less than 2008.  That's 44\u00b2 = 1936.  So, there are 44 perfect squares less than 2008.\n**The Answer**\nSince there are 44 perfect squares less than 2008, there are 2008 - 44 = **1964** numbers less than 2008 that have an even number of divisors. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**Understanding Divisors**\n* **Pairs:**  Every divisor of a number has a corresponding \"partner\" divisor. For example, the divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. Notice how they come in pairs: (1, 12), (2, 6), (3, 4).\n* **Perfect Squares:** The only time a divisor doesn't have a partner is when it's the square root of the number.  For instance, the divisors of 9 are 1, 3, and 9. The number 3 is paired with itself.\n**The Key Insight**\nA number will have an even number of divisors if and only if it is *not* a perfect square. This is because each divisor (except for the square root) has a partner.\n**Counting the Perfect Squares**\n1. Find the largest perfect square less than 2008:  The largest perfect square less than 2008 is 44\u00b2 = 1936.\n2. Count the perfect squares from 1\u00b2 to 44\u00b2: There are 44 perfect squares less than 2008.\n**The Solution**\n1. There are 2007 positive integers less than 2008.\n2. Subtract the number of perfect squares: 2007 - 44 = 1963.\n**Answer:** There are **1963** positive integers less than 2008 that have an even number of divisors. \n",

Notice how they pair up: (1, 12), (2, 6), (3, 4).\n* **Odd vs. Even Number of Divisors:**\n    * If a number has an odd number of divisors, it means one divisor is its own pair (it's paired with itself). This happens when the number is a perfect square (like 9: 1, 3, 9).\n    * If a number has an even number of divisors, all divisors come in pairs.\n**Finding the Numbers with an Even Number of Divisors**\n1. **Perfect Squares:**  We need to count the perfect squares less than 2008.  The largest perfect square less than 2008 is 44\u00b2 = 1936.  There are 44 perfect squares from 1\u00b2 to 44\u00b2.\n2. **Non-Perfect Squares:** All the numbers less than 2008 that aren't perfect squares will have an even number of divisors (since their divisors come in pairs).  \n3. **Total:** To find the total number of integers less than 2008 with an even number of divisors, subtract the number of perfect squares from the total number of integers less than 2008:\n   2007 - 44 = **1963**\n**Therefore, there are 1963 positive integers less than 2008 that have an even number of divisors.** \n",
