    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The only way for the sum of the numbers Paul and Jesse choose to be odd is if one of them chooses 2 and the other chooses an odd prime. There are five ways for Paul to choose 2 and Jesse to choose an odd prime, and there are five ways for Jesse to choose 2 and Paul to choose an odd prime. Since there are $6\\cdot 6=36$ total possible ways for Paul and Jesse to choose their numbers, the probability that the sum of the numbers Paul and Jesse choose is NOT even is $\\frac{10}{36}=\\frac{5}{18}$. Therefore, the probability that the sum of the numbers Paul and Jesse choose IS even is $1-\\frac{5}{18}=\\boxed{\\frac{13}{18}}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Identify the First Six Primes**\nThe first six prime numbers are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13.\n**2. Determine the Conditions for an Even Sum**\nThe sum of two numbers is even if:\n* Both numbers are even.\n* Both numbers are odd.\n**3. Analyze the Possibilities**\n* **Even + Even:** Only one of the six primes is even (2).  So, if Paul chooses 2, Jesse must also choose 2 to get an even sum.  This is one successful outcome.\n* **Odd + Odd:** There are five odd primes.  Paul can choose any of these five, and Jesse can choose any of the remaining four. This gives us 5 * 4 = 20 successful outcomes.\n**4. Calculate the Total Possible Outcomes**\nPaul has 6 choices, and Jesse has 6 choices, giving a total of 6 * 6 = 36 possible combinations.\n**5. Calculate the Probability**\nThe probability of the sum being even is the number of successful outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes:\n(1 + 20) / 36 = 21/36 = **7/12**\n**Therefore, the probability that the sum of the numbers Paul and Jesse choose is even is 7/12.** \n",

Understand Even and Odd Number Combinations:**\n* **Even + Even = Even**\n* **Odd + Odd = Even**\n* **Even + Odd = Odd**\n**3. Determine the Number of Even and Odd Primes:**\n* **Even:** There is one even prime number (2).\n* **Odd:** There are five odd prime numbers (3, 5, 7, 11, 13).\n**4. Calculate the Probability:**\n* **Scenario 1: Both choose even**\n   - Paul has a 1/6 chance of choosing 2.\n   - Jesse has a 1/6 chance of choosing 2 (given Paul already chose 2).\n   - The probability of this scenario is (1/6) * (1/6) = 1/36.\n* **Scenario 2: Both choose odd**\n   - Paul has a 5/6 chance of choosing an odd prime.\n   - Jesse also has a 5/6 chance of choosing an odd prime (given Paul chose an odd prime).\n   - The probability of this scenario is (5/6) * (5/6) = 25/36.\n* **Total Probability:** Add the probabilities of the two scenarios: 1/36 + 25/36 = 26/36 = 13/18\n**Therefore, the probability that the sum of the numbers Paul and Jesse choose is even is 13/18.** \n",

Determine the Possibilities:**\n* **Even Possibilities:** Only the number 2 is even. \n* **Odd Possibilities:**  All other primes (3, 5, 7, 11, 13) are odd.\n**4. Calculate the Probabilities:**\n* **Probability of Paul choosing an even number:** 1/6 (there's one even prime out of six total)\n* **Probability of Paul choosing an odd number:** 5/6\n* **Probability of Jesse choosing an even number:** 1/6\n* **Probability of Jesse choosing an odd number:** 5/6\n**5. Calculate the Probability of an Even Sum:**\nTo get an even sum, we need either:\n* **Paul chooses even, Jesse chooses even:** (1/6) * (1/6) = 1/36\n* **Paul chooses odd, Jesse chooses odd:** (5/6) * (5/6) = 25/36\n**6. Add the Probabilities:**\nThe total probability of the sum being even is: (1/36) + (25/36) = **26/36**, which simplifies to **13/18**.\n**Therefore, the probability that the sum of the numbers Paul and Jesse choose is even is 13/18.** \n",
