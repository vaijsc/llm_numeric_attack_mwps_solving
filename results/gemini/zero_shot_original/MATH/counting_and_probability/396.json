        "Here's how to calculate the expected winnings:\n**1. Probability of Winning:**\n* You have one ticket and there are 100,000 tickets sold.\n* The probability of winning is 1/100,000.\n**2. Expected Winnings from the Jackpot:**\n* If you win, you get $250,000.\n* The probability of winning is 1/100,000.\n* Expected winnings from the jackpot = (Probability of winning) * (Amount won) = (1/100,000) * ($250,000) = $2.50\n**3. Expected Loss from Ticket Cost:**\n* You always pay $3 for the ticket.\n* Expected loss = -$3\n**4. Total Expected Winnings:**\n* Total expected winnings = Expected winnings from the jackpot + Expected loss from ticket cost\n* Total expected winnings = $2.50 - $3 = -$0.50\n**Therefore, the expected winnings from buying one ticket are -$0.50. This means, on average, you can expect to lose 50 cents for every ticket you buy.** \n",
        "Here's how to calculate the expected winnings:\n**1. Probability of Winning:**\n* There's one winning ticket out of 100,000 total tickets.\n* The probability of winning is 1/100,000.\n**2. Probability of Losing:**\n* The probability of losing is 1 - (probability of winning) = 1 - (1/100,000) = 99,999/100,000\n**3. Expected Winnings for Winning:**\n* If you win, you get the $250,000 jackpot, but you also paid $3 for the ticket.\n* Your net winnings would be $250,000 - $3 = $249,997\n**4. Expected Winnings for Losing:**\n* If you lose, you lose the $3 you spent on the ticket.\n**5. Calculating the Overall Expected Winnings:**\n* Expected winnings are calculated as: (Probability of Winning * Winnings if Winning) + (Probability of Losing * Winnings if Losing)\n* Expected winnings = (1/100,000 * $249,997) + (99,999/100,000 * -$3) \n* Expected winnings = $2.49997 - $2.99997 \n* **Expected winnings = -$0.50**\n**Therefore, the expected winnings of buying one ticket are -$0.50. This means, on average, you are expected to lose $0.50 for every ticket you buy.** \n",

Probability of Losing:**\n* Probability of losing = (100,000 - 1) / 100,000 = 99,999/100,000\n**3. Expected Value of Winning:**\n*  If you win, you get $250,000, but you also spent $3 on the ticket.\n* Net winnings in case of winning = $250,000 - $3 = $249,997\n* Expected value of winning = (Probability of winning) * (Net winnings in case of winning)\n* Expected value of winning = (1/100,000) * ($249,997) = $2.49997\n**4. Expected Value of Losing:**\n* If you lose, you lose the $3 you spent on the ticket.\n* Expected value of losing = (Probability of losing) * (Amount lost)\n* Expected value of losing = (99,999/100,000) * (-$3) = -$2.99997\n**5. Total Expected Winnings:**\n* Total expected winnings = Expected value of winning + Expected value of losing\n* Total expected winnings = $2.49997 + (-$2.99997) = -$0.50\n**Conclusion:**\nThe expected winnings of buying one ticket are **-$0.50**.
