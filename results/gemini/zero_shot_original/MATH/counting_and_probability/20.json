    "solution": "First choose which seat is empty. It doesn't matter which seat we choose because we can rotate everyone at the table to move the empty seat anywhere we want. After the empty seat has been chosen, there are $6!=\\boxed{720}$ ways to arrange the remaining people.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Fix a Person:**\n* Since we're dealing with a circular table, rotations don't change the arrangement. To avoid overcounting, let's fix one person's position. \n**2.  Arrange the Remaining People:**\n* Now we have 5 remaining people to arrange in the 6 remaining seats. This is a simple permutation. \n**3.  Calculate the Permutations:**\n* The number of ways to arrange 5 people in 5 seats is 5! (5 factorial), which is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.\n**Therefore, there are 120 ways to arrange 6 people around a circular table with 7 seats.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding Circular Permutations**\n* **Linear Permutations:**  In a line, the order matters, and ABC is different from CBA.\n* **Circular Permutations:**  In a circle, only the relative positions matter.  ABC, BCA, and CAB are all considered the same arrangement because they represent the same circular order.\n**Solving the Problem**\n1. **Fix a Person:**  Imagine fixing one person's position. This eliminates the rotation issue since we're now focusing on arrangements relative to that fixed person.\n2. **Remaining Arrangements:** We have 5 people left to arrange in the remaining 6 seats.  This is a standard linear permutation problem.\n3. **Calculating the Arrangements:** The number of ways to arrange 5 people in 6 seats is 6P5 = 6!/(6-5)! = 6! = 720.\n**However, we need to account for overcounting:**\n* Since we fixed one person's position, we've counted every arrangement 6 times (for each of the 6 seats that person could have been fixed to).\n**Final Answer:**\nTo get the correct number of circular arrangements, divide the number of linear arrangements by 6:\n720 / 6 = **120**\n**Therefore, there are 120 ways to arrange 6 people around a circular table with 7 seats.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1.  Think about linear arrangements:**\n* If we were arranging the 6 people in a line, there would be 6! (6 factorial) ways to do it: 6 choices for the first spot, 5 for the second, and so on.  This gives us 6*5*4*3*2*1 = 720 ways.\n**2.  Account for circular arrangements:**\n* In a circular arrangement, we have to account for the fact that rotating everyone by one seat results in the same arrangement. Since there are 7 seats, each distinct circular arrangement corresponds to 7 different linear arrangements. \n**3.  The calculation:**\n* To get the number of distinct circular arrangements, divide the number of linear arrangements by 7: 720 / 7 = 102.857...\n**4.  The answer:**\n* Since we can't have fractions of arrangements, we round down.  There are **102** ways to arrange 6 people around a circular table with 7 seats. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding Circular Permutations**\n* In a circular arrangement, we only care about the relative positions of the people, not the absolute position of a specific seat. \n* For example, if we rotate everyone one seat to the right, it's considered the same arrangement.\n**Step-by-Step Solution**\n1. **Fix a Person:**  Since rotations are considered the same, let's fix one person's position. This eliminates the issue of rotations being different arrangements.\n2. **Remaining Arrangements:** Now we have 5 remaining people to arrange in the 6 remaining seats.\n3. **Linear Permutations:**  The remaining arrangements are like a linear permutation. We have 6 choices for the second seat, 5 for the third, and so on.\n4. **Calculation:**  The number of ways to arrange 5 people in 6 seats is 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 = 720\n**Important Note:**  We don't need to multiply by 6 like we would in a linear permutation because we've already fixed one person's position, preventing overcounting due to rotations.\n**Answer:** There are **720** ways to arrange 6 people around a circular table with 7 seats. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Fix a Position:**\n* Since rotations are considered the same, we can fix one person's position.  Let's imagine placing the first person in any of the 7 seats. \n**2. Arrange the Remaining People:**\n* Now, we have 6 remaining people to arrange in the 6 remaining seats.  This can be done in 6! (6 factorial) ways, which is 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720.\n**3. Account for Overcounting:**\n* We've overcounted because we initially treated all 7 seats as distinct.  Since we fixed one person's position, we've actually counted each arrangement 7 times (once for each possible starting position).\n**4. Final Calculation:**\n* To get the correct number of arrangements, divide the initial count by 7: 720 / 7 = 102.857...\n**Therefore, there are 102 ways to arrange 6 people around a circular table with 7 seats.** \n"
