Thus we can append either or both of the remaining two digits to any of these two-digit integers and preserve divisibility by $4$.  For each, there are $2$ ways to choose one digit to append, and $2$ ways to order the digits if we append both of them.  Thus we get $4$ more integers for each, or $12$ total.\n\nThe full number is $12+3+1=\\boxed{16}$ integers.",

Consider the Possibilities for the Last Two Digits**\n* **The last digit must be even:** We have two choices: 2 or 4.\n* **The second to last digit must make the last two digits divisible by 4:**\n    * If the last digit is 2, the second to last digit must be 1 or 3 (to form 12 or 32).\n    * If the last digit is 4, the second to last digit must be 1 or 3 (to form 14 or 34).\n**3.  Fill in the Remaining Digits**\nSince we've used two digits, we have two remaining digits.  We can place them in the first two positions in any order.  There are 2! = 2 ways to do this.\n**4.  Calculate the Total Number of Possibilities**\n* We have 2 choices for the last digit.\n* For each choice of the last digit, we have 2 choices for the second to last digit.\n* We have 2 ways to arrange the remaining digits.\nTherefore, there are 2 * 2 * 2 = **8** different positive integers divisible by 4 that can be formed. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Conditions**\n* **Divisible by 4:** A number is divisible by 4 if the last two digits are divisible by 4.\n* **Unique Digits:** We can use each digit (1, 2, 3, 4) only once.\n**2. Analyze the Possibilities for the Last Two Digits**\nTo form a number divisible by 4, we need to consider the possible combinations for the last two digits:\n* **12:**  Divisible by 4\n* **24:**  Divisible by 4\n* **32:**  Divisible by 4\n* **44:**  Not allowed (repeating digits)\n**3.  Form the Numbers**\nFor each valid combination of last two digits, we can place the remaining two digits in the hundreds and thousands places.  Let's look at the possibilities:\n* **Last two digits are 12:**\n    * 3412\n    * 4312\n* **Last two digits are 24:**\n    * 1324\n    * 3124\n* **Last two digits are 32:**\n    * 1432\n    * 4132\n**4.

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Understanding the Rules**\n* **Divisible by 4:** A number is divisible by 4 if the last two digits are divisible by 4.\n* **Using digits 1, 2, 3, and 4:**  We can only use these four digits, and each digit can be used at most once.\n**2. Finding the Possible Last Two Digits**\nThe last two digits must form a number divisible by 4.  Let's list the possibilities:\n* **12:** Divisible by 4\n* **24:** Divisible by 4\n* **32:** Divisible by 4\n* **44:** Divisible by 4 \n**3.  Completing the Numbers**\nFor each of the possible last two digits, we have two remaining digits to fill the first two positions. Since we can't repeat digits, we have two choices for the first digit and one choice for the second. This gives us 2 * 1 = 2 possibilities for each pair of last digits.\n**4.  Calculating the Total**\nWe have 4 possible pairs of last digits (12, 24, 32, 44), and each pair gives us 2 possible complete numbers. Therefore, there are a total of 4 * 2 = **8** different positive integers divisible by 4 that can be formed. \n",
