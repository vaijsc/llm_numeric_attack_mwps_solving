    "problem": "Ryan has 3 red lava lamps and 3 blue lava lamps. He arranges them in a row on a shelf randomly, then turns 3 random lamps on. What is the probability that the leftmost lamp on the shelf is red, and the leftmost lamp which is turned on is also red?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are $\\binom{6}{3}=20$ ways for Ryan to arrange the lamps, and $\\binom{6}{3}=20$ ways for him to choose which lamps are on, giving $20\\cdot20=400$ total possible outcomes. There are two cases for the desired outcomes: either the left lamp is on, or it isn't. If the left lamp is on, there are $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ ways to choose which other lamps are on, and $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ ways to choose which other lamps are red. This gives $10\\cdot10=100$ possibilities. If the first lamp isn't on, there are $\\binom{5}{3}=10$ ways to choose which lamps are on, and since both the leftmost lamp and the leftmost lit lamp must be red, there are $\\binom{4}{1}=4$ ways to choose which other lamp is red. This case gives 40 valid possibilities, for a total of 140 valid arrangements out of 400. Therefore, the probability is $\\dfrac{140}{400}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{20}}$.",

        "Here's how we can break down the problem step by step:\n**1. Probability of the leftmost lamp on the shelf being red:**\n* There are 6 total lamps, and 3 are red.\n* The probability of the leftmost lamp being red is 3/6 = 1/2.\n**2. Probability of the leftmost lamp being turned on, given it's red:**\n* After the lamps are arranged, there are 3 lamps turned on out of 6 total.\n* Since the leftmost lamp is red, the probability of it being turned on is 1/2 (since there are 3 red lamps, and 3 are turned on).\n**3. Combined Probability**\n* To get the probability of both events happening, we multiply the individual probabilities:\n    (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4\n**Therefore, the probability that the leftmost lamp on the shelf is red, and the leftmost lamp which is turned on is also red is 1/4.** \n",
