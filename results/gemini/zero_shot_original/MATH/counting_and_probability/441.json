    "solution": "All whole numbers can be written as $4k$, $4k+1$, $4k+2$, or $4k+3$ for some integer $k$. Suppose we look at the smaller of the two consecutive numbers. If it is of the form $4k$, it is a multiple of 4. If it is of the form $4k+3$, the other is $4k+4$, a multiple of 4. If on the other hand, it can be written as $4k+1$ or $4k+2$, neither number is a multiple of 4. So in two of the four equally likely cases, one of the numbers is a multiple of 4, for a probability of $2/4=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the problem:**\nWe need to find the probability of getting a multiple of 4 when selecting two consecutive whole numbers.\n**2. Consider the possible cases:**\n* **Case 1: Both numbers are NOT multiples of 4.**  This means the first number could be 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, or 7.  Each of these possibilities leads to a consecutive pair that doesn't have a multiple of 4.\n* **Case 2: One number is a multiple of 4.** This means the first number could be 4 or 8, and the consecutive number will then be a multiple of 4.\n**3. Calculate the total possible outcomes:**\nThere are an infinite number of pairs of consecutive whole numbers.  However, we can think about a finite set to represent the pattern. For example, the first 10 consecutive pairs:\n(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 7), (7, 8), (8, 9), (9, 10), (10, 11)\n**4. Calculate the favorable outcomes:**\nThere are two pairs where one number is a multiple of 4: (3, 4) and (7, 8).\n**5. Determine the probability:**\n* **Probability = (Favorable Outcomes) / (Total Possible Outcomes)**\n* **Probability = 2 / 10 = 1/5**\n**Answer:** The probability that one of the two consecutive whole numbers is a multiple of 4 is **1/5**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Consider the Possibilities**\n* **Case 1: Both numbers are not multiples of 4.**  This can happen in several ways:\n    *  {1, 2}, {2, 3}, {3, 4}, {5, 6}, {6, 7}, {7, 8}, {9, 10}, ...\n* **Case 2: One number is a multiple of 4.** This also happens in several ways:\n    * {4, 5}, {8, 9}, {12, 13}, ...\n**2.  Analyze the Patterns**\n* Notice that in every group of four consecutive numbers, there's exactly one number that's a multiple of 4.\n    * Example: {11, 12, 13, 14}  --  Only 12 is a multiple of 4.\n**3. Calculate the Probability**\n* Since there's one favorable outcome (one multiple of 4) out of every group of four consecutive numbers, the probability is:\n   \n   **1/4** \n",

Determine the favorable outcomes:**\n* In each case, there's exactly one favorable outcome (where one of the numbers is a multiple of 4).\n**3.  Determine the total possible outcomes:**\n* There are infinitely many pairs of consecutive whole numbers.  However, the probability will be the same regardless of the starting number. \n**4.  Calculate the probability:**\n*  Since there's one favorable outcome for every two possible outcomes, the probability is **1/2**. \n**Therefore, the probability that one of the two consecutive whole numbers is a multiple of 4 is 1/2.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Consider the possible remainders when dividing by 4:**\n* A whole number divided by 4 can have a remainder of 0, 1, 2, or 3.\n**2. Analyze consecutive numbers:**\n* If the first number has a remainder of 0 (i.e., it's a multiple of 4), the next number will have a remainder of 1.\n* If the first number has a remainder of 1, the next number will have a remainder of 2.\n* If the first number has a remainder of 2, the next number will have a remainder of 3.\n* If the first number has a remainder of 3, the next number will have a remainder of 0 (a multiple of 4).\n**3. Determine the favorable outcomes:**\n* Out of the four possible scenarios, two of them result in one of the consecutive numbers being a multiple of 4.\n**4. Calculate the probability:**\n* The probability of selecting two consecutive numbers where one is a multiple of 4 is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n* Probability = 2/4 = **1/2** \n",
