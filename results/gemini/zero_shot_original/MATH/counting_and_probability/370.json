        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding the Problem**\nWe need to find all the rectangles within the grid that have an area of 8 square units.  Since the grid is made of unit squares, each rectangle will be formed by combining unit squares.\n**Finding the Rectangles**\n* **Think about the factors of 8:** The factors of 8 are 1, 2, 4, and 8. These represent the possible dimensions of our rectangles.\n* **Consider the grid:** The grid is 6 squares by 6 squares. This limits the possible rectangles we can form. \n* **Finding the Rectangles:**\n    * **1 x 8 rectangle:** We can fit a 1 x 8 rectangle horizontally or vertically within the grid.\n    * **2 x 4 rectangle:** We can fit a 2 x 4 rectangle horizontally or vertically within the grid.\n**Counting the Possibilities**\nLet's count the number of each type of rectangle:\n* **1 x 8 rectangles:**\n    * **Horizontal:** We can start the 1 x 8 rectangle at any of the 5 positions along the top or bottom row. This gives us 10 horizontal 1 x 8 rectangles.\n    * **Vertical:**  Similarly, we can start the 1 x 8 rectangle at any of the 5 positions along the left or right columns. This gives us 10 vertical 1 x 8 rectangles.\n* **2 x 4 rectangles:**\n    * **Horizontal:** We can start the 2 x 4 rectangle at any of the 4 positions along the top or bottom row. This gives us 8 horizontal 2 x 4 rectangles.\n    * **Vertical:** Similarly, we can start the 2 x 4 rectangle at any of the 4 positions along the left or right columns. This gives us 8 vertical 2 x 4 rectangles.\n**Total Rectangles**\nAdding up all the possibilities: 10 + 10 + 8 + 8 = **36**\n**Therefore, there are 36 rectangles of area 8 square units that can be formed using the line segments of the grid.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding the Requirements**\n* **Area of 8:** We need rectangles with an area of 8 square units.  The only factors of 8 are 1, 2, 4, and 8. This means our rectangles must have dimensions of either 1 x 8 or 2 x 4.\n* **Grid Lines:**  The sides of the rectangles must align with the grid lines.\n**Finding the Rectangles**\n1. **1 x 8 Rectangles:**\n    *  We can have 1 x 8 rectangles oriented horizontally or vertically. \n    *  **Horizontally:** There are 5 possible horizontal lines to use as the top of the rectangle, and 5 possible lines below that to use as the bottom. This gives us 5 * 5 = 25 possible 1 x 8 rectangles.\n    *  **Vertically:**  Similarly, we have 5 possible vertical lines to use as the left side of the rectangle and 5 to use as the right side, giving us 5 * 5 = 25 possible 1 x 8 rectangles.\n2. **2 x 4 Rectangles:**\n    * **Horizontally:** There are 4 possible horizontal lines to use as the top of the rectangle and 4 possible lines below that to use as the bottom. This gives us 4 * 4 = 16 possible 2 x 4 rectangles.\n    * **Vertically:**  There are 4 possible vertical lines to use as the left side and 4 to use as the right side, giving us 4 * 4 = 16 possible 2 x 4 rectangles.\n**Total Rectangles**\nAdding up all the possibilities: 25 + 25 + 16 + 16 = **82 rectangles**\n**Therefore, there are 82 rectangles with an area of 8 square units that can be formed using the grid lines.** \n",

Consider the Dimensions**\n* The only possible dimensions for a rectangle with an area of 8 are 1 x 8 or 2 x 4.\n**3. Count the Possibilities**\n* **1 x 8 rectangles:**  \n    * There are 5 horizontal lines of length 8.\n    * For each of these, there are 5 vertical lines that could be used to create a rectangle.\n    * This gives us 5 * 5 = 25 possible 1 x 8 rectangles.\n* **2 x 4 rectangles:**\n    * There are 5 horizontal lines of length 4.\n    * For each of these, there are 4 vertical lines that could be used to create a rectangle.\n    * This gives us 5 * 4 = 20 possible 2 x 4 rectangles.\n**4. Total Rectangles**\n* Adding the two types of rectangles, we have 25 + 20 = **45** rectangles with an area of 8 square units. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding the Problem**\nWe need to find all the rectangles that have an area of 8 square units within the 6x6 grid.  Since the grid is made of unit squares, we need to figure out the possible combinations of length and width that multiply to 8.\n**Possible Dimensions**\n* **Length = 8, Width = 1:** This is not possible within the 6x6 grid.\n* **Length = 4, Width = 2:** This is possible.\n**Counting the Rectangles**\nLet's focus on rectangles with length 4 and width 2:\n* **Start with the length:** We can place a length of 4 units horizontally in 3 different positions along each row of the grid.\n* **Place the width:** For each of those length positions, we can place the width of 2 units in 4 different positions vertically within the row.\n**Total Rectangles**\nTherefore, the total number of rectangles with an area of 8 square units is:\n3 positions (for length) * 4 positions (for width) = **12 rectangles** \n",
