    "solution": "There are $\\binom{6}{3}=20$ ways to choose three of the dice to show prime numbers. Each roll is prime with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$ and composite with probability $\\frac{1}{3}$, so each arrangement of 3 prime numbers and 3 composite numbers occurs with probability $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{\\!3}\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^{\\!3}.$ Therefore, the probability that three dice show prime numbers and the rest show composite numbers is $$20\\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{\\!3}\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^{\\!3}=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{54}}.$$",

        "Here's how we can break down the problem to find the probability:\n**1. Identify Prime and Composite Numbers**\n* **Prime Numbers (1-6):** 2, 3, 5\n* **Composite Numbers (1-6):** 4, 6 \n**2. Calculate the Probability of a Single Die**\n* **Probability of rolling a prime number:** 3/6 = 1/2\n* **Probability of rolling a composite number:** 2/6 = 1/3\n**3.  Determine the Combinations**\nWe need three prime numbers and three composite numbers.  Let's represent this as \"PPPCCC\".  The order in which these numbers appear doesn't matter.  We can use combinations to figure out how many different ways this can happen:\n* **Combinations Formula:**  nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)\n    * n = total number of items (in this case, 6 dice)\n    * r = number of items chosen (in this case, 3 prime numbers or 3 composite numbers)\n* **Calculate the combinations:**\n    * 6C3 = 6! / (3! * 3!) = 20\n**4. Calculate the Probability of a Specific Combination**\nLet's take one specific combination like \"PPPCCC\". The probability of this happening is:\n* (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/3) * (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/216\n**5.  Calculate the Overall Probability**\nSince there are 20 different combinations that satisfy our condition, we multiply the probability of a single combination by 20:\n* 20 * (1/216) = 5/54\n**Therefore, the probability of rolling three prime numbers and three composite numbers with six dice is 5/54.** \n",

Combinations**\nWe need to figure out how many ways we can get three prime numbers and three composite numbers.  This is a combination problem:\n* **Combinations of 3 primes from 6 rolls:**  \u2076C\u2083 = (6!)/(3!3!) = 20\n* **Combinations of 3 composites from 6 rolls:** \u2076C\u2083 = (6!)/(3!3!) = 20\n**4. Total Possible Outcomes**\nEach die has 6 possible outcomes.  With 6 dice, the total number of possible outcomes is 6\u2076 = 46,656\n**5. Calculate the Probability**\n* **Probability of getting 3 primes and 3 composites:** (Number of successful combinations) / (Total possible outcomes)\n* (20 * 20) / 46,656 = 400 / 46,656 \n* **Simplify:**  approximately 0.00856\n**Therefore, the probability of rolling three prime numbers and three composite numbers when rolling six dice is approximately 0.856%.** \n",
        "Here's how to break down the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Identify Prime and Composite Numbers**\n* **Prime Numbers:**  Numbers greater than 1 that are only divisible by 1 and themselves (2, 3, 5).\n* **Composite Numbers:** Numbers greater than 1 that have more than two factors (4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12).\n**2. Probability of a Single Die**\n* **Probability of rolling a prime number:** 3 prime numbers (2, 3, 5) out of 6 possible outcomes = 3/6 = 1/2\n* **Probability of rolling a composite number:** 3 composite numbers (4, 6, 8) out of 6 possible outcomes = 3/6 = 1/2\n**3.

Here's where combinations come into play:\n* **Choosing 3 prime numbers out of 6:**  This can be done in  \u2076C\u2083 ways (6 choose 3), which is 6!/(3!3!) = 20 ways.\n* **Choosing 3 composite numbers out of 6:** This can also be done in \u2076C\u2083 ways = 20 ways.\n**4. Total Possible Outcomes**\n* Each die has 6 possible outcomes, and we're rolling 6 dice. So, the total number of possible outcomes is 6\u2076 = 46,656.\n**5. Calculate the Probability**\n* **Probability of getting 3 prime and 3 composite:** (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total possible outcomes)\n   * Favorable outcomes: 20 ways to choose prime * 20 ways to choose composite = 400\n   * Total possible outcomes: 46,656\n   * Probability: 400/46,656 = **approximately 0.00857**\n**Therefore, the probability of rolling three prime numbers and three composite numbers with six dice is approximately 0.00857 or about 0.86%.** \n",
