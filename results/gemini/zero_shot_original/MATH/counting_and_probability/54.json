        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Understanding the Possibilities**\nWe need to attach two equilateral triangles to the pentagon. There are five possible locations for each triangle, but we're told to use only two of the five. \n**2.  Avoiding Congruent Figures**\nWe want to find *non-congruent* figures, meaning figures that can't be made identical by rotations or reflections. \n**3. Analyzing the Positions**\n* **Case 1: Both triangles on the same side of the pentagon:**  If we place both triangles on the same side of the pentagon (for example, both triangles attached to side AB), we'll get congruent figures no matter where we place them.\n* **Case 2: Triangles on opposite sides of the pentagon:** If we place the triangles on opposite sides of the pentagon, we need to consider the following:\n    * **Symmetry:** If the triangles are placed symmetrically (for example, one on side AB and the other on side DE), the resulting figure will be symmetrical.\n    * **Asymmetry:** If the triangles are placed asymmetrically (for example, one on side AB and the other on side BC), the resulting figure will be asymmetrical.\n**4. Counting the Non-Congruent Figures**\n* **Symmetrical Figures:** There are 5 ways to choose the first side of the pentagon for the triangle, and then only one way to choose the opposite side for the second triangle. This gives us 5 symmetrical figures.\n* **Asymmetrical Figures:** For each side of the pentagon, we have 3 choices for where to place the triangle on the adjacent side (two sides are already taken). This means we have 5 * 3 = 15 possible asymmetrical figures. However, each asymmetrical figure is counted twice (once for each side it's attached to). Therefore, we have 15/2 = 7.5 asymmetrical figures.  Since we can't have half a figure, we round down to 7 asymmetrical figures.\n**5. Total Non-Congruent Figures**\nAdding the symmetrical and asymmetrical figures, we get a total of 5 + 7 = **12** non-congruent figures. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Understanding the Possibilities**\n* We have a regular pentagon, and we need to add two equilateral triangles.\n* Each triangle can be attached to two sides of the pentagon.\n**2. Analyzing the Configurations**\nLet's consider the positions where we can attach the triangles:\n* **Case 1: Triangles on Adjacent Sides**\n   * If we place one triangle on side AB and the other on side BC, the resulting figure will be congruent to the one where we place one triangle on side CD and the other on DE (due to symmetry).\n   * Similarly, placing triangles on BC and CD is congruent to placing them on DE and EA.\n   * This gives us **one distinct configuration** for adjacent triangles.\n* **Case 2: Triangles on Opposite Sides**\n   * If we place one triangle on side AB and the other on side DE, the resulting figure will be congruent to the one where we place one triangle on side BC and the other on EA (due to symmetry).\n   * This gives us **one distinct configuration** for opposite triangles.\n* **Case 3: Triangles with a Side in Common**\n   * If we place the triangles so that they share a side of the pentagon, the resulting figure will be different from the previous cases. We can do this in 5 different ways (one for each side of the pentagon). However, due to symmetry, these 5 figures are all congruent.\n   * This gives us **one distinct configuration** for triangles sharing a side.\n**3. Conclusion**\nTherefore, we can construct a total of **3** non-congruent figures by attaching two equilateral triangles to the pentagon in the given manner. \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem:\n**Understanding the Problem**\nWe have a regular pentagon and we want to attach two equilateral triangles to it. The triangles can be attached to any two of the five sides. We need to figure out how many *different* shapes we can create this way, ignoring rotations and reflections of the same shape.\n**Possible Locations**\n* **Side 1:** We can attach an equilateral triangle to side AB.\n* **Side 2:** We can attach an equilateral triangle to side BC.\n* **Side 3:** We can attach an equilateral triangle to side CD.\n* **Side 4:** We can attach an equilateral triangle to side DE.\n* **Side 5:** We can attach an equilateral triangle to side EA.\n**Analyzing Combinations**\nLet's think about the different ways we can choose two sides to attach the triangles:\n1. **Sides 1 and 2:**  This creates a shape with two triangles on adjacent sides. \n2. **Sides 1 and 3:** This creates a different shape with two triangles separated by one side.\n3. **Sides 1 and 4:** This creates a different shape with two triangles separated by two sides. \n4. **Sides 1 and 5:** This creates a shape that is congruent to the one in case 2.\n**Important Note:** Notice that choosing sides 1 and 5 gives us the same shape as choosing sides 1 and 3 because we're only interested in non-congruent figures. We can apply this logic to other choices.\n**Continuing the Analysis**\nWe can continue this pattern, considering all combinations:\n* **Sides 2 and 3:**  Same shape as sides 1 and 4.\n* **Sides 2 and 4:**  Same shape as sides 1 and 3.\n* **Sides 2 and 5:**  Same shape as sides 1 and 2.\n* **Sides 3 and 4:**  Same shape as sides 1 and 2.\n* **Sides 3 and 5:**  Same shape as sides 1 and 3.\n* **Sides 4 and 5:**  Same shape as sides 1 and 4.\n**Conclusion**\nWe have found three distinct shapes that can be created by attaching two equilateral triangles to a regular pentagon:\n1. **Two triangles on adjacent sides:** (Sides 1 and 2)\n2. **Two triangles separated by one side:** (Sides 1 and 3)\n3. **Two triangles separated by two sides:** (Sides 1 and 4)\n**Therefore, there are 3 non-congruent figures that can be constructed.** \n",
        "Here's how we can solve the problem:\n**1. Consider the symmetry:**\n* The pentagon has five-fold rotational symmetry.  This means that if we rotate the figure by 72 degrees, it looks the same. \n* This symmetry implies that we only need to consider attaching the equilateral triangles to one of the pentagon's sides. The other positions will produce congruent figures.\n**2.  Possible Triangle Attachments:**\n* We can attach an equilateral triangle to a side of the pentagon in two ways:\n    * **Exterior:**  The triangle is attached to the outside of the pentagon.\n    * **Interior:**  The triangle is attached to the inside of the pentagon.\n**3.  Analyzing the Cases:**\n* **Case 1: One Exterior Triangle, One Interior Triangle:**  We can place the exterior triangle in any of the five positions.  The interior triangle must then be placed on a side adjacent to the exterior triangle.  This creates 5 distinct figures.\n* **Case 2:  Two Exterior Triangles:** We can place the first exterior triangle in any of the five positions. The second exterior triangle must be placed on a side that is not adjacent to the first triangle's side.  This gives us 5 possible positions for the second triangle. However, since rotations produce congruent figures, we've overcounted.  Each figure has been counted 5 times (once for each of the five possible positions). So, there are only $5/5=1$ distinct figure in this case.\n* **Case 3: Two Interior Triangles:**  This case is similar to case 2. We have 5 initial positions for the first triangle, and then only one non-adjacent side for the second triangle. Again, this gives us 5 figures, but we've overcounted by a factor of 5, leaving us with $5/5=1$ distinct figure.\n**4.  Total Non-Congruent Figures:**\nWe have 5 non-congruent figures from Case 1, 1 from Case 2, and 1 from Case 3.  Therefore, there are a total of **7** non-congruent figures that can be constructed. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Consider the Possibilities**\n* We have five possible positions to attach the first equilateral triangle.\n* For each position of the first triangle, we have four remaining positions for the second triangle.\n**2. Recognize Congruence**\n* **Rotation:** If we rotate the pentagon, the figures formed by attaching triangles in the same positions relative to the pentagon will be congruent. So, we only need to consider one of the five starting positions for the first triangle. \n* **Reflection:**  If we reflect the pentagon, the figures formed by attaching triangles in the same positions relative to the pentagon will also be congruent.  \n**3.  Analyze the Cases**\nLet's focus on attaching the first equilateral triangle to side $AB$ and then consider the possible positions for the second triangle.  \n* **Case 1:** The second triangle is attached to side $BC$. This figure is unique.\n* **Case 2:** The second triangle is attached to side $CD$. This figure is unique. \n* **Case 3:** The second triangle is attached to side $DE$. This figure is congruent to the figure formed in Case 1 (by rotation).\n* **Case 4:** The second triangle is attached to side $EA$. This figure is congruent to the figure formed in Case 2 (by rotation).\n**4. The Answer**\nSince there are only two non-congruent figures possible, the answer is **2**. \n"
