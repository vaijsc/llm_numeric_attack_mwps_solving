        "Here's how to break down the problem step-by-step:\n**1. The Difficult Cases:**\n* **Anna and Betty:** They won't take the goldfish, so they have 5 choices each (4 cats + 1 dog).\n* **Charlie and Danny:** They want cats, so they have 4 choices each.\n**2. The Easy Cases:**\n* **The remaining 3 kids:** They'll take any pet, so they have 7 choices each.\n**3. Calculating the Possibilities:**\n* **Anna and Betty:** 5 choices each, so 5 * 5 = 25 combinations.\n* **Charlie and Danny:** 4 choices each, so 4 * 4 = 16 combinations.\n* **The other 3 kids:** 7 choices each, so 7 * 7 * 7 = 343 combinations.\n**4. The Total Number of Ways:**\nTo get the total number of ways Mr. Smith can distribute the pets, multiply the number of possibilities for each group: 25 * 16 * 343 = **137,200**\n**Therefore, there are 137,200 ways Mr. Smith can give his children pets they'll want.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  The Difficult Choices:**\n* **Anna and Betty:** They won't take the goldfish, leaving them with 6 options (4 cats + 2 dogs).\n* **Charlie and Danny:** They want cats, leaving them with 4 options (Siamese, Persian, Calico, Minx).\n**2.  The Easy Choices:**\n* The remaining 3 kids (let's call them Emily, Frank, and Gary) are happy with any pet, so they have 7 options each.\n**3.  Calculations:**\n* **Anna and Betty:**  Each has 6 choices, so there are 6 * 6 = 36 ways they can choose.\n* **Charlie and Danny:** Each has 4 choices, so there are 4 * 4 = 16 ways they can choose.\n* **Emily, Frank, and Gary:** Each has 7 choices, so there are 7 * 7 * 7 = 343 ways they can choose.\n**4.  Total Combinations:**\nTo get the total number of ways Mr. Smith can give out the pets, we multiply the possibilities for each group: 36 * 16 * 343 = **196,576**\n**Therefore, there are 196,576 ways Mr. Smith can give his children pets they will want.** \n",
        "Here's how to break down the problem step by step:\n**1.  Assign the cats:**\n* Charlie and Danny each get one of the four cats.  There are 4 choices for Charlie and then 3 choices left for Danny. This gives us 4 * 3 = 12 ways to assign the cats.\n**2.  Assign the goldfish:**\n* Anna and Betty refuse the goldfish, leaving the other 3 kids to choose. There are 3 ways to assign the goldfish.\n**3. Assign the dogs:**\n* The remaining two children will take the dogs. There are 2 ways to assign the first dog and then only 1 way left for the second dog. This gives us 2 * 1 = 2 ways to assign the dogs.\n**4.  Combine the possibilities:**\nTo find the total number of ways Mr. Smith can assign the pets, we multiply the number of possibilities for each step:\n12 ways (cats) * 3 ways (goldfish) * 2 ways (dogs) = **72 ways**\n**Therefore, there are 72 ways Mr. Smith can give his children pets they'll want.** \n",
