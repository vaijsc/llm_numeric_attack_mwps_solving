    "problem": "I have two cubes such that, on each cube, three faces are painted red and three faces are painted white. If I roll each of the cubes once, what is the probability that they will land such that there is one red face and one white face up?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are four possible ways for the cubes to land: two red faces up, the first with a red face and the second with a white face up, the first with a white face and the second with a red face up, and two white faces up. So, there are two ways that the cubes can land such that there is a red face up and a white face up. The probability that we get a red face up is $\\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}$. Similarly, the probability that we get a white face up is $\\frac{1}{2}$. Thus, the probability that the cubes land such that there is one red face and one white face up is $2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.\n\nAlternate solution: After you roll the first cube, the second one must be the other color, which occurs with probability $\\frac{3}{6} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Possible Outcomes for Each Cube**\n* Each cube has two possible outcomes when rolled: red face up or white face up.\n**2.  Possible Outcomes for Both Cubes**\n* Since we're rolling two cubes, there are four possible combinations:\n    * Red - Red\n    * Red - White\n    * White - Red\n    * White - White\n**3.  Favorable Outcomes**\n* We want the probability of getting one red and one white face up. This happens in two out of the four possible combinations:\n    * Red - White\n    * White - Red\n**4.  Calculate the Probability**\n* The probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes: \n    * Probability = 2 / 4 = 1/2\n**Therefore, the probability of rolling one red face and one white face is 1/2 or 50%.** \n",
        "Here's how to break down the probability problem step-by-step:\n**1. Possible Outcomes for Each Cube**\n* Each cube has two possible outcomes when rolled: red face up or white face up.\n**2.  Possible Outcomes for Both Cubes**\n* Since we're rolling two cubes, we need to consider all the combinations:\n    * Red-Red (RR)\n    * Red-White (RW)\n    * White-Red (WR)\n    * White-White (WW)\n**3. Favorable Outcomes**\n* We want the probability of getting one red and one white face up.  This means we're interested in these outcomes:\n    * Red-White (RW)\n    * White-Red (WR)\n**4. Calculating the Probability**\n* We have 4 possible outcomes in total (from step 2).\n* 2 of these outcomes are favorable (from step 3).\n* Therefore, the probability of getting one red and one white face up is 2/4, which simplifies to **1/2**.\n**Answer:** The probability of getting one red face and one white face up when rolling the two cubes is 1/2. \n",
        "Here's how to break down the probability calculation:\n**1. Possible Outcomes for Each Cube**\n* Each cube has two possible outcomes: it can land with a red face up or a white face up.\n**2. Total Possible Outcomes**\n* Since we're rolling two cubes, there are 2 x 2 = 4 total possible outcomes.\n**3. Favorable Outcomes**\n* We want one red face and one white face. There are two ways this can happen:\n    * Cube 1: Red, Cube 2: White\n    * Cube 1: White, Cube 2: Red\n**4. Calculating the Probability**\n* Probability = (Favorable Outcomes) / (Total Possible Outcomes)\n* Probability = 2 / 4 = 1/2\n**Therefore, the probability of rolling one cube with a red face up and the other with a white face up is 1/2 or 50%.** \n",
        "Here's how to break down the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Possible Outcomes for Each Cube**\n* Since each cube has 3 red faces and 3 white faces, there are two possible outcomes for each roll: red or white.\n**2.

Favorable Outcomes**\n* We have two favorable outcomes (listed in step 2) where one cube shows red and the other shows white.\n**5. Calculate the Probability**\n* Probability = (Favorable Outcomes) / (Total Possible Outcomes)\n* Probability = 2 / 4 = 1/2\n**Therefore, the probability of rolling one red face and one white face is 1/2 or 50%.** \n",
