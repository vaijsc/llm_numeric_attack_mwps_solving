        "Here's how to break down the probability calculation step by step:\n**1.  Possible Outcomes for a Single Spin**\n* **Body Part:**  2 options (arm or leg)\n* **Color:** 4 options (including red)\nSo, there are 2 * 4 = 8 possible outcomes for each spin.\n**2. Favorable Outcomes for a Single Spin**\n* We want either an arm to red or a leg to red. This gives us 2 favorable outcomes.\n**3. Probability of a Favorable Outcome in a Single Spin**\n* The probability of getting a favorable outcome is (number of favorable outcomes) / (total number of outcomes) = 2 / 8 = 1/4.\n**4.  Favorable Outcomes for Four Spins**\n* We need exactly two moves to a red spot (and thus two moves that are not to a red spot).\n* We also need three arm moves (and thus one leg move).\nLet's represent this with a string of letters: \"ARRRL\" where:\n    *  \"A\" represents an arm move.\n    *  \"R\" represents a move to red.\n    *  \"L\" represents a leg move.\nWe need to figure out how many different ways we can arrange these letters.\n**5. Counting Arrangements**\n* There are 5! (5 factorial, or 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120) ways to arrange 5 distinct items.\n* However, the \"A\"s and \"R\"s are not distinct. \n*  To correct for this, we need to divide by the number of ways to rearrange the \"A\"s (3! = 6) and the number of ways to rearrange the \"R\"s (2! = 2).\nThe total number of favorable arrangements is 120 / (6 * 2) = 10\n**6. Probability of Favorable Arrangements**\n* We know the probability of a single favorable spin is 1/4.\n* The probability of a single unfavorable spin is 3/4 (since there are 3 non-red colors).\nTherefore, the probability of a specific sequence (like \"ARRRL\") is: \n(1/4) * (1/4) * (1/4) * (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/1024\n**7. Final Calculation**\nSince we have 10 different favorable arrangements, the final probability is:\n10 * (3/1024) = **30/1024** \n",
        "Here's how we can break down the probability calculation step-by-step:\n**1.  Possible Outcomes for a Single Spin:**\n* **Body Part:**  2 options (arm or leg)\n* **Color:** 4 options (including red)\nThis gives us a total of 2 * 4 = 8 possible outcomes for each spin.\n**2.  Favorable Outcomes for a Single Spin:**\n* **Arm to Red:** 1 option \n**3.  Probability of a Favorable Outcome on a Single Spin:**\nThe probability of getting a favorable outcome (arm to red) on a single spin is 1/8.\n**4.  Probability of Two Red Spots:**\nWe need two spins to land on red. We can use the binomial probability formula for this:\n* **n:** Number of trials (spins) = 4\n* **k:** Number of successes (red spots) = 2\n* **p:** Probability of success on a single spin (arm to red) = 1/8\n* **q:** Probability of failure on a single spin (not arm to red) = 7/8\nThe binomial probability formula is:  P(X = k) = (nCk) * p^k * q^(n-k) \nWhere (nCk) is the binomial coefficient, calculated as n! / (k! * (n-k)!).\nTherefore, the probability of getting exactly two red spots is:\nP(X = 2) = (4C2) * (1/8)^2 * (7/8)^2 = 6 * (1/64) * (49/64) = 294/4096\n**5. Probability of Three Arm Moves:**\nWe can use the binomial probability formula again, but this time with:\n* **n:** Number of trials (spins) = 4\n* **k:** Number of successes (arm moves) = 3\n* **p:** Probability of success on a single spin (arm) = 1/2\n* **q:** Probability of failure on a single spin (leg) = 1/2\nThe probability of getting exactly three arm moves is:\nP(X = 3) = (4C3) * (1/2)^3 * (1/2)^1 = 4 * (1/8) * (1/2) = 1/4\n**6. Combining the Probabilities:**\nTo get the probability of both events happening (exactly two red spots AND exactly three arm moves), we multiply the probabilities:\n(294/4096) * (1/4) = **73.5/4096**\n**Therefore, the probability of exactly two moves to a red spot and exactly three arm moves in four spins is 73.5/4096.** \n",
        "Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:\n**1.  Possible Outcomes for Each Spin**\n* **Body Part:**  2 possibilities (arm or leg)\n* **Color:** 4 possibilities (including red)\n**2.  Desired Outcomes**\nWe want:\n* **2 red spots:**  This means 2 spins have red, and 2 spins have a color other than red.\n* **3 arm moves:** This means 3 spins have arm, and 1 spin has leg.\n**3. Calculating the Probability of a Single Desired Outcome**\nLet's consider one specific outcome that fits our conditions:  \"Arm-Red, Arm-Red, Arm-Not Red, Leg-Not Red\". \n* **Probability of \"Arm-Red\":** (1/2) * (1/4) = 1/8\n* **Probability of \"Arm-Not Red\":** (1/2) * (3/4) = 3/8\n* **Probability of \"Leg-Not Red\":** (1/2) * (3/4) = 3/8\nThe probability of this specific outcome is: (1/8) * (1/8) * (3/8) * (3/8) = 27/4096\n**4.  Counting the Number of Desired Outcomes**\nWe need to figure out how many different ways we can arrange the desired outcomes (2 red, 3 arm, 1 leg). This is a combination problem:\n* We have 4 spins, and we want to choose 2 of them to be red:  \u2074C\u2082 = 6 ways\n* We have 4 spins, and we want to choose 3 of them to be arm: \u2074C\u2083 = 4 ways\nSo, there are 6 * 4 = 24 different ways to arrange the desired outcomes.\n**5.  Final Calculation**\nThe final probability is the probability of a single desired outcome multiplied by the number of possible desired outcomes:\n(27/4096) * 24 = **162/1024** \n**Therefore, the probability of exactly two moves to a red spot and exactly three arm moves in four spins is 162/1024.** \n",

Favorable Outcomes**\nWe need to count the outcomes where:\n* **Exactly two moves are to a red spot:**  We need to choose 2 spins out of 4 to be red, which can be done in  \u2074C\u2082 ways (4 choose 2) = 6 ways.\n* **Exactly three moves are an arm:** We need to choose 3 spins out of 4 to be an arm, which can be done in \u2074C\u2083 ways (4 choose 3) = 4 ways.\n**4.  Calculating the Probability**\n* For each of the 6 ways to choose the two red spins, there are 4 ways to choose the three arm spins.  \n* For each of these 6 * 4 = 24 combinations of red spins and arm spins, there are 3 possibilities for the color of the other two spins (since they can't be red).\n* For each of these 24 * 3 = 72 combinations of spins, there's only one specific order the body parts and colors can occur in to satisfy our conditions.\n**5.  Final Calculation**\n* The probability of getting exactly two moves to a red spot and exactly three arm moves is: \n   (72 favorable outcomes) / (4096 total possible outcomes) = **9/512** \n",
