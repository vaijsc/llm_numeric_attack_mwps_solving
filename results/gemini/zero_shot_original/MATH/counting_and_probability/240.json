    "solution": "Because 17 is between $5\\times3=15$ and $6\\times 3 = 18$, we know that $\\dfrac{17}{3}$ is somewhere between $5$ and $6$. Since $\\left(\\dfrac{17}{3}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{17^2}{3^2}=\\dfrac{289}{9}$, we see that 289 is between $32\\times9=288$ and $33\\times9=297$ and thus that $\\left(\\dfrac{17}{3}\\right)^2$ is between 32 and 33. Therefore, the integers from 6 to 32, inclusive, lie between $\\dfrac{17}{3}$ and $\\left(\\dfrac{17}{3}\\right)^2$ on the number line, for a total of $32-6+1=\\boxed{27}$ integers.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Calculate the Approximate Values:**\n*  $\\dfrac{17}{3} \\approx 5.67$\n*  $\\left(\\dfrac{17}{3}\\right)^2 \\approx 31.56$\n**2.  Identify the Integers:**\n*  The integers between 5.67 and 31.56 are 6, 7, 8, ..., 31.\n**3.  Count the Integers:**\n* To count them easily, notice that we have 31 - 6 + 1 = **26** integers.\n**Therefore, there are 26 integers between 17/3 and (17/3)^2.** \n",

        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Understand the Bounds:**\n*  **Lower Bound:**  17/3 is approximately 5.67.\n* **Upper Bound:** (17/3)^2 is approximately 30.44.\n**2. Identify the Integers:**\nThe integers between 5.67 and 30.44 are:\n* 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30.\n**3.

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Approximate the values:**\n*  (17/3) is a little more than 5 (since 15/3 = 5).\n* (17/3)^2 is a little more than 5 * 5 = 25 (since we're squaring a number slightly larger than 5).\n**2. Identify the integers:**\n* Since (17/3) is slightly larger than 5, the integers between (17/3) and its square are 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, and 24. \n**3.
