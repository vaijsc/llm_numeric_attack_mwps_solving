        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding the Problem**\nWe need to find the number of ways to move from point E to point G using only steps that go either down (south) or to the right (east).\n**Breaking it Down**\n* **Total Steps:** To get from E to G, we need to take a total of 8 steps (5 to the right and 3 down).\n* **Step Combinations:** Each path is a sequence of \"R\" (right) and \"D\" (down).  For example, one path could be \"RRDDDRRR\".\n**Calculating the Possibilities**\nWe need to choose 5 of the 8 steps to be \"R\" (the rest will automatically be \"D\").  This is a combination problem:\n* **Formula:** The number of ways to choose *k* items from a set of *n* is given by the combination formula:  nCr = n! / (k! * (n-k)!)\n* **Applying the Formula:** In this case, we have n = 8 (total steps) and k = 5 (steps to the right). So, the number of paths is: 8C5 = 8! / (5! * 3!) = 56.\n**Answer**\nThere are **56** different 9-step paths from E to G. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**Understanding the Problem**\nWe need to find all possible paths from point E to point G, moving only right (R) or down (D).  Each path will have 9 steps.\n**Visualizing the Solution**\nImagine moving from E to G.  You need to move 5 steps right (R) and 4 steps down (D).  A path can be represented by a sequence of R's and D's. For example:\n* RRDRDDRRD represents a path that goes right, right, down, right, down, down, right, right, down.\n**Counting the Paths**\nThe problem boils down to finding how many ways we can arrange 5 R's and 4 D's.  This is a classic combinatorics problem.\n* **Think of it as slots:** You have 9 slots to fill, and you need to choose 5 of them to be R's (the rest will automatically be D's).\n* **Formula:** The number of ways to choose 5 items out of 9 is given by the combination formula: \u2079C\u2085 = 9! / (5! * 4!) = 126\n**Answer**\nTherefore, there are **126** different 9-step paths from E to G. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding the Problem**\n* We have a grid where we can only move right or down.\n* We want to find the number of paths from point E to point G.\n**Thinking Step-by-Step**\n1. **Total Steps:**  To reach G from E, we need to take 5 steps right (R) and 4 steps down (D). This gives us a total of 9 steps.\n2. **Possible Arrangements:** We need to find how many ways we can arrange these 5 Rs and 4 Ds.\n3. **Combinations:**  This is a classic combination problem. The number of ways to arrange *n* objects, where *r* are of one type and *(n-r)* are of another type, is given by:\n   * **nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)**\n4. **Applying the Formula:** In our case, n = 9 (total steps), r = 5 (steps right). So the number of paths is:\n   * **9C5 = 9! / (5! * 4!) = (9 * 8 * 7 * 6) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 126**\n**Answer:** There are **126** different 9-step paths from E to G. \n",
        "To get from $E$ to $G$, you must move 5 steps to the right and 4 steps down.  This means a 9-step path from $E$ to $G$ is completely determined by choosing which 5 of the 9 steps are to the right.  Therefore, there are $\\binom{9}{5} = \\boxed{126}$ such paths. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding the Problem**\nWe need to find all the possible ways to move from point *E* to point *G* following these rules:\n* **Only move right or down.** You can only move one step to the right or one step down at a time.\n* **9 steps total.**  You need to take exactly 9 steps to reach *G*.\n**Solution**\n1. **Necessary Moves:** To get from *E* to *G*, you must move 5 steps to the right (to reach the same column as *G*) and 4 steps down (to reach the same row as *G*).\n2. **Choosing Steps:** Imagine representing each step as a \"R\" for right or \"D\" for down. We need a sequence of 9 letters, with 5 \"R\"s and 4 \"D\"s. \n3. **Combinations:**  The problem now becomes: how many ways can we arrange 5 \"R\"s and 4 \"D\"s?  This is a classic combinatorics problem. \n4. **Formula:** The number of ways to arrange *n* objects, where *r* are identical and *n-r* are identical, is:\n   n! / (r! * (n-r)!)\n5. **Applying the Formula:** In our case, n = 9 (total steps), r = 5 (right steps).  So the number of paths is:\n   9! / (5! * 4!) = (9 * 8 * 7 * 6) / (4 * 3 * 2) = 126\n**Answer:** There are **126** different 9-step paths from *E* to *G*. \n"
