    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The number of combinations of fruit possible is $\\binom{5}{3} = 10$. However, if strawberries and pineapples cannot go together, that decreases the number of combinations by three (because they could be paired with apples, grapes, or bananas). Similarly, if grapes and bananas cannot go together, the number of combinations is reduced by another three. Thus, $10 - 3 - 3 = \\boxed{4}$ such salads are possible.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Identify the Restrictions:**\n* Strawberries and pineapples cannot be in the same salad.\n* Grapes and bananas cannot be in the same salad.\n**2.  Consider Cases:**\nWe need to consider all possible combinations of fruits while respecting the restrictions. Let's break it down into cases:\n* **Case 1: Salad contains strawberries**\n   * If strawberries are in the salad, pineapples cannot be. \n   * The other two fruits must be chosen from apples, bananas, and grapes. This gives us 3 options for the second fruit and 2 options for the third fruit.  So there are 3 * 2 = 6 possible salads in this case.\n* **Case 2: Salad contains pineapples**\n   * If pineapples are in the salad, strawberries cannot be.\n   * The other two fruits must be chosen from apples, bananas, and grapes. Similar to Case 1, there are 3 * 2 = 6 possible salads in this case.\n* **Case 3: Salad contains neither strawberries nor pineapples**\n   * We are left with apples, bananas, and grapes. \n   * Since grapes and bananas cannot be together, we must choose one of them and two apples. There are 2 options for the fruit to pair with the apples. This gives us 2 possible salads in this case.\n**3.  Total Possibilities:**\nTo get the total number of possible salads, we add the possibilities from each case: 6 + 6 + 2 = **14**\n**Therefore, there are 14 possible good tasting and appetizing fruit salads.** \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this step-by-step:\n**1.  Consider the Restrictions:**\n* **Strawberries and Pineapples:**  These cannot be in the salad together.\n* **Grapes and Bananas:** These cannot be in the salad together.\n**2.  Identify Possible Combinations:**\n* **Case 1: Salad with Strawberries** \n   *  If the salad has strawberries, it cannot have pineapples.  This leaves us with apples, bananas, and grapes.  We can choose 2 of these 3 fruits:  \u00b3C\u2082 = 3 ways.\n* **Case 2: Salad with Pineapples**\n   * If the salad has pineapples, it cannot have strawberries.  This leaves us with apples, bananas, and grapes. We can choose 2 of these 3 fruits: \u00b3C\u2082 = 3 ways.\n* **Case 3: Salad without Strawberries or Pineapples**\n   *  We have apples, bananas, grapes. We can choose 3 of these 3 fruits: \u00b3C\u2083 = 1 way.\n**3.  Total Number of Salads:**\nAdd up the possibilities from each case: 3 + 3 + 1 = **7**\n**Therefore, there are 7 possible good tasting and appetizing fruit salads.** \n",

Consider the Possibilities:**\n* **Case 1: No Strawberries or Pineapples:**  \n   We have three fruits left (apples, bananas, grapes) and need to choose 3. There's only **1** way to do this (we have to take all three).\n* **Case 2: Strawberries but no Pineapples:** \n    We need to choose 2 more fruits from apples, bananas, and grapes.

        "Here's how to break down the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Start with the restrictions:**\n* Strawberries and pineapples can't be together.\n* Grapes and bananas can't be together.\n**2.  Consider the \"forbidden\" combinations:**\n* **Strawberry-Pineapple:** This rules out any salad with both of these fruits.\n* **Grape-Banana:**  This also eliminates any salads with both these fruits.\n**3.  Work with the remaining possibilities:**\n* **Case 1:  No forbidden fruits** \n   *  This means using only apples, grapes, and bananas (or apples, strawberries, and pineapples).  There are 3 choices for the first fruit, 2 for the second, and 1 for the third.  This seems like 3*2*1 = 6 combinations, but we've overcounted (apple-banana-grape is the same salad as grape-banana-apple).  We need to divide by the number of ways to order 3 things: 3! = 6. \n   * So, there are 6/6 = 1 combination in this case.\n* **Case 2: One forbidden fruit**\n   *  We can't have both strawberry and pineapple or both grape and banana.  Let's say we use a strawberry, but not a pineapple. This leaves us with apple, grape, and banana.  Again, there's only 1 valid combination here (since we've already accounted for the order). The same logic applies if we use a pineapple instead of a strawberry, or if we use a grape but not a banana. \n   * There are 4 combinations in this case (strawberry without pineapple, pineapple without strawberry, grape without banana, banana without grape).\n**4.  Total combinations:**\n*  Add the combinations from each case: 1 + 4 = **5**\n**Therefore, there are 5 possible good-tasting and appetizing fruit salads.** \n",
        "Here's how to break down the problem:\n**1. Start with all possible combinations:**\n*  We have 5 fruits and want to choose 3, so we use combinations: \u2075C\u2083 = (5!)/(3!2!) = 10\n**2. Identify the forbidden combinations:**\n* **Strawberries and Pineapples:**  We can't have both in a salad.\n* **Grapes and Bananas:** We can't have both in a salad.\n**3. Calculate combinations with forbidden fruits:**\n* **Strawberries and Pineapples:**  We need to subtract the combinations that include both. If we have strawberries and pineapples, the third fruit can be any of the remaining three.  So there are 3 forbidden combinations.\n* **Grapes and Bananas:**  Similar to the above, there are 3 forbidden combinations.\n**4. Avoid double counting:**\n* Notice that the combination \"Strawberries, Pineapples, Grapes\" is counted as forbidden twice (once for strawberries/pineapples and once for grapes/bananas).  We need to add this combination back in to avoid double-counting.\n**5. Final calculation:**\n* Total possible combinations: 10\n* Forbidden combinations: 3 + 3 = 6\n* Double-counted combination: 1\n* Good-tasting and appetizing salads: 10 - 6 + 1 = **5**\n**Therefore, there are 5 possible good-tasting and appetizing fruit salads.** \n"
