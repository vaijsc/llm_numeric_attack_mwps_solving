    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The easiest solution is to find the number of positive integers with only 2 and 3 as their prime factors. If the number has no factors of 3, the qualifying numbers are $2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4, 2^5, 2^6$ for 7 total. If there is one factor of 3, we have $2^0 \\cdot 3^1, 2^1 \\cdot 3^1, 2^2 \\cdot 3^1, 2^3 \\cdot 3^1, 2^4 \\cdot 3^1, 2^5 \\cdot 3^1$ for 6 total. With two factors of 3, we have $2^0 \\cdot 3^2, 2^1 \\cdot 3^2, 2^2 \\cdot 3^2, 2^3 \\cdot 3^2$ for 4 total. With three factors of 3, we have $2^0 \\cdot 3^3, 2^1 \\cdot 3^3$ for 2 total. Finally, $3^4$ gives us 1 more. So, there are $7+ 6+4+2+1 = 20$ positive integers less than or equal to 100 that have only 2 and 3 as prime factors. Therefore, there are $100-20 = \\boxed{80}$ positive integers less than or equal to 100 that have a prime factor greater than 4.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Prime Numbers Less Than or Equal to 4:**\n* The prime numbers less than or equal to 4 are 2 and 3.\n**2. Integers with Only Prime Factors 2 and 3:**\n* These integers will be of the form 2^a * 3^b, where a and b are non-negative integers. \n* To find how many of these are less than or equal to 100, we can consider the possible values of a and b:\n    * If a = 0, b can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 (giving us 5 integers)\n    * If a = 1, b can be 0, 1, 2 (giving us 3 integers)\n    * If a = 2, b can be 0, 1 (giving us 2 integers)\n    * If a = 3, b can be 0 (giving us 1 integer)\n    * If a > 3, then 2^a * 3^b will be greater than 100.\n* So, there are 5 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 11 integers that have only prime factors 2 and 3.\n**3. Integers with a Prime Factor Greater Than 4:**\n* Since there are 100 positive integers less than or equal to 100, and we've found 11 that don't have a prime factor greater than 4, the remaining integers must have a prime factor greater than 4.\n* Therefore, there are 100 - 11 = **89** positive integers less than or equal to 100 that have a prime factor greater than 4. \n",
