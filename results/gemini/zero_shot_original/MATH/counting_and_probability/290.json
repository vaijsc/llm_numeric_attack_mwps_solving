    "solution": "A five-digit palindrome would be of the form $ABCBA$, where $A$, $B$, and $C$ are digits (not necessarily distinct) from $0$ to $9$ (with $A$ from $1$ to $9$). We have three possibilities for each of $A$, $B$ and $C,$ which gives us $3^3 = \\boxed{27}$ possible palindromes.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding Palindromes**\nA five-digit palindrome has the form _ _ _ _ _, where the first two digits are the same as the last two digits in reverse order. \n**Breaking Down the Problem**\n* **First Digit:** We have 3 choices for the first digit (1, 2, or 9).\n* **Second Digit:**  We also have 3 choices for the second digit (1, 2, or 9).\n* **Third Digit:** We have 3 choices for the third digit (1, 2, or 9).\n**Calculating the Possibilities**\nSince the first two digits determine the last two, we only need to consider the first three digits.  The total number of palindromes is:\n3 choices (for the first digit) * 3 choices (for the second digit) * 3 choices (for the third digit) = **27**\n**Therefore, there are 27 five-digit palindromes that can be made from the digits 1, 2, and 9.** \n",

Understanding Palindromes**\nA five-digit palindrome has the form _ _ _ _ _, where the first and last digits are the same, the second and fourth digits are the same, and the middle digit can be anything.\n**2. Filling the Digits**\n* **First and Last Digits:** We have 3 choices for the first digit (1, 2, or 9) and the last digit must be the same.\n* **Second and Fourth Digits:** We also have 3 choices for the second digit (1, 2, or 9), and the fourth digit must be the same.\n* **Middle Digit:** We have 3 choices for the middle digit (1, 2, or 9).\n**3. Calculating the Total Number**\nTo get the total number of palindromes, we multiply the number of choices for each digit:\n3 choices * 3 choices * 3 choices = **27**\n**Therefore, there are 27 five-digit palindromes that can be made from the digits 1, 2, and 9.** \n",
