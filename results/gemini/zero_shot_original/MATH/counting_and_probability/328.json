    "solution": "For the ball to end up back in the center, the ball must deflect left 4 of the 8 times, and right the other 4 times. There are $\\binom{8}{4}$ ways to pick which 4 of the rows to deflect the ball left and then the other 4 to deflect it right.  Each deflection is to the left with probability $\\frac12$ and to the right with probability $\\frac12$, so each possible path to the bottom occurs with probability $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{2}\\right)^{\\!8}$.

        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n* **The ball must make an equal number of left and right turns.**  To land in the middle slot, the ball needs to make the same number of left and right turns.  Since there are 7 rows of pegs, the ball must make 3 left turns and 3 right turns.\n* **Calculate the probability of one specific path.**  Consider one specific path: LLRRRL.  The probability of this path is:  \n    * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = (1/2)^7\n* **Count the total number of paths.**  We need to figure out how many different ways the ball can make 3 left turns and 3 right turns. This is a combination problem.  The number of ways to choose 3 left turns out of 7 total turns is:\n    * 7C3 = 7! / (3! * 4!) = 35\n* **Calculate the final probability.**  The probability of the ball landing in the middle slot is the number of successful paths divided by the total possible paths:\n    * (35 * (1/2)^7) = **35/128** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Paths**\nTo land in the middle slot, the ball needs to bounce an equal number of times to the left and right.  Since there are 4 rows of pegs, the ball must bounce twice to the left and twice to the right. \n**2. Calculate the Probability of One Specific Path**\nLet's consider one specific path the ball could take to land in the middle slot:\n* **Right, Left, Left, Right** \nThe probability of this specific path is:\n(1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/16\n**3. Determine the Number of Possible Paths**\nWe need to figure out how many different combinations of \"left\" and \"right\" bounces result in two of each.  Think of it like arranging the letters \"L\" (left) and \"R\" (right):\n* LLRR\n* LRRL\n* LRLR\n* RLLR\n* RLRL\n* RRLL\nThere are 6 possible paths.\n**4. Calculate the Total Probability**\nSince each path has a probability of 1/16, and there are 6 possible paths, the total probability of the ball landing in the middle slot is:\n6 * (1/16) = **3/8** \n",
        "To land in the middle slot, the ball needs to deflect to the right 3 times and to the left 3 times.  \nHere's why:\n* **Starting Point:** The ball starts in the center.\n* **First Deflection:**  It must deflect either left or right.\n* **Second Deflection:** It must deflect in the opposite direction of the first deflection to stay in the middle column. \n* **Third Deflection:** It must deflect in the same direction as the first deflection to stay in the middle column. \n* **Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Deflections:**  To reach the middle slot, the ball needs to repeat this pattern of alternating deflections, resulting in a total of 3 right and 3 left deflections.\nNow, let's calculate the probability:\n* **Probability of one specific sequence:** The probability of any specific sequence of 6 deflections (e.g., RLRRLR) is (1/2)^6 = 1/64.\n* **Number of possible sequences:**  There are many ways to get 3 right and 3 left deflections. To figure out how many, we can think of it as choosing 3 out of 6 positions for the \"R\"s (the rest will automatically be \"L\"s).  This is a combination problem, and we can use the formula: \u2076C\u2083 = 6!/(3!3!) = 20.\n* **Total Probability:**  The probability of landing in the middle slot is the probability of any one specific sequence multiplied by the number of possible sequences: (1/64) * 20 = **5/16**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n* **Understanding the Problem:** The ball must fall directly down the middle path to land in the middle slot. This means it must go right, then left, then right, then left, etc.  \n* **Probability of One Step:**  At each peg, the ball has a 1/2 probability of going left and a 1/2 probability of going right.\n* **Probability of Multiple Steps:** Since each step is independent (the previous step doesn't affect the next), we multiply the probabilities of each step together.\n* **Total Steps:** The ball needs to hit 7 pegs to reach the bottom.\n* **Calculation:** \n   * The probability of going right, then left, then right, then left, etc. for 7 steps is: (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = (1/2)^7 = 1/128\n**Therefore, the probability of the ball landing in the middle slot is 1/128.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Understand the Problem**\n* The ball starts in the middle.\n* It must move right twice for each move left to end up in the middle slot. \n* We need to find the probability of this specific sequence of movements.\n**2.  Possible Paths**\nTo reach the middle slot, the ball needs to make a total of 7 moves (since there are 7 rows of pegs). Here's a possible path:\n* Right (R)\n* Left (L)\n* Right (R)\n* Right (R)\n* Left (L)\n* Right (R)\n* Left (L)\nThis path has 4 moves to the right (R) and 3 moves to the left (L).  \n**3.  Probability of a Specific Path**\nEach move has a probability of 1/2 (either right or left).  Since each move is independent, we multiply the probabilities together:\n(1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = (1/2)^7 = 1/128\n**4.  Counting Paths**\nThe path above is just one way to reach the middle slot. We need to figure out how many other possible paths exist. This is a combination problem:\n* We have 7 moves total.\n* We need to choose 4 of them to be moves to the right.\nThe number of combinations is given by: 7C4 = 7! / (4! * 3!) = 35\n**5.  Final Probability**\nWe multiply the probability of one specific path by the number of possible paths:\n(1/128) * 35 = **35/128**\n**Therefore, the probability that the ball lands in the middle slot is 35/128.** \n"
