    "solution": "Let $x$ be the probability we are looking for and $y$ be the probability that they both spin the same number. By symmetry, it's clear that the probability of Zack getting a larger number than Max does is also equal to $x$. Furthermore, all possible outcomes can be divided into three categories: Max gets a larger number than Zack does, Max and Zack get the same number, or Zack gets a larger number than Max. The sum of the probabilities of these three events is 1, which gives us the equation $x+y+x=1$.\n\nWe can calculate $y$ with a little bit of casework. There are four ways in which they can both get the same number: if they both get 1's, both get 2's, both get 3's or both get 4's. The probability of getting a 1 is $\\dfrac{1}{2}$, so the probability that they will both spin a 1 is $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{2}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{1}{4}$. Similarly, the probability of getting a 2 is $\\dfrac{1}{4}$, so the probability that they will both spin a 2 is $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{4}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{1}{16}$. The probability of getting a 3 is $\\dfrac{1}{6}$, so the probability that they will both get a 3 is $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{6}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{1}{36}$ and the probability that they will both get a 4 is $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{12}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{1}{144}$. This gives us  $$y=\\dfrac{1}{4}+\\dfrac{1}{16}+\\dfrac{1}{36}+\\dfrac{1}{144}=\\dfrac{25}{72}.$$Substituting this into $2x+y=1$ gives us $2x=\\dfrac{47}{72}$, so $x=\\boxed{\\dfrac{47}{144}}$.",

        "Here's how to break down the problem and find the solution:\n**1. Cases to Consider**\nSince Max spins first, we need to consider each possible outcome for Max and then figure out what Zack needs to spin to get a lower number.\n**2.  Max Spins a 1**\n* **Zack's Possibilities:**  Zack can spin a 1 (tie) or a 2, 3, or 4 (Max wins).\n* **Probability:** The probability Zack gets a 1 is 1/2. The probability Zack gets 2, 3, or 4 is 1/4 + 1/6 + 1/12 = 1/2.\n* **Max Wins Probability (if Max spins 1):** 1/2 \n**3. Max Spins a 2**\n* **Zack's Possibilities:** Zack can spin a 1 or 2 (Max wins).\n* **Probability:** The probability Zack gets a 1 or 2 is 1/2 + 1/4 = 3/4.\n* **Max Wins Probability (if Max spins 2):** 3/4\n**4. Max Spins a 3**\n* **Zack's Possibilities:** Zack can spin a 1, 2, or 3 (Max wins).\n* **Probability:** The probability Zack gets 1, 2, or 3 is 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/6 = 11/12.\n* **Max Wins Probability (if Max spins 3):** 11/12\n**5. Max Spins a 4**\n* **Zack's Possibilities:** Zack can spin any number (Max wins).\n* **Probability:** The probability Zack gets any number is 1.\n* **Max Wins Probability (if Max spins 4):** 1\n**6. Combining Probabilities**\nTo get the overall probability of Max winning, we need to consider the probability of each of these cases happening, along with the probability of Max winning in each case:\n* **Probability Max spins 1 AND wins:** (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4\n* **Probability Max spins 2 AND wins:** (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n* **Probability Max spins 3 AND wins:** (1/6) * (11/12) = 11/72\n* **Probability Max spins 4 AND wins:** (1/12) * (1) = 1/12\n**7. Final Calculation**\nAdd the probabilities of each winning scenario:\n1/4 + 3/16 + 11/72 + 1/12 = **17/36**\n**Therefore, the probability that Max gets a larger number than Zack is 17/36.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.
