    "solution": "Let $x$ be the probability that a 1 is rolled.  Then the probability that a 2 is rolled is $2x$, the probability that a 3 is rolled is $3x$, and so on.  Since the sum of all these probabilities must be 1, we have that $x + 2x + \\cdots + 6x = 1$, which means that $21x = 1$, so $x = \\frac{1}{21}$.

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Determine the Probabilities**\n* The probabilities must add up to 1 (or 100%). \n* Let  'x' represent the probability of rolling a 1.\n* The probabilities for each roll are:\n    * 1: x\n    * 2: 2x\n    * 3: 3x\n    * 4: 4x\n    * 5: 5x\n    * 6: 6x\n**2. Set up the Equation**\nThe sum of all probabilities must equal 1: \nx + 2x + 3x + 4x + 5x + 6x = 1\n**3. Solve for x**\n* Combine like terms: 21x = 1\n* Divide both sides by 21: x = 1/21\n**4. Calculate the Probabilities**\n* Now that you know x, you can find the probability of each roll:\n    * P(1) = 1/21\n    * P(2) = 2/21\n    * P(3) = 3/21 = 1/7\n    * P(4) = 4/21\n    * P(5) = 5/21\n    * P(6) = 6/21 = 2/7\n**5. Calculate the Expected Value**\nThe expected value is the average of all possible outcomes, weighted by their probabilities:\nExpected Value = (1 * P(1)) + (2 * P(2)) + (3 * P(3)) + (4 * P(4)) + (5 * P(5)) + (6 * P(6))\nExpected Value = (1 * 1/21) + (2 * 2/21) + (3 * 1/7) + (4 * 4/21) + (5 * 5/21) + (6 * 2/7)\nExpected Value = 1/21 + 4/21 + 9/21 + 16/21 + 25/21 + 36/21\nExpected Value = 91/21 \n**6.

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Determine the Probabilities**\n* Since the probabilities are proportional to the values, we need to find a constant of proportionality.  Let's call this constant *k*. \n* The probabilities of each face are:\n    * P(1) = *k*\n    * P(2) = 2*k*\n    * P(3) = 3*k*\n    * P(4) = 4*k*\n    * P(5) = 5*k*\n    * P(6) = 6*k*\n**2.
