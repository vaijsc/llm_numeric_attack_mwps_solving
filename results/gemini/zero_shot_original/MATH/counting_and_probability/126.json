        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Consider the Size of the Squares**\n* **1x1 squares:**  There are 16 of these, one for each dot.\n* **2x2 squares:**  Think of the grid as having four 2x2 squares within it. Each of these 2x2 squares can be shifted one spot to the right or down, giving us 4*3 = 12 possible 2x2 squares.\n* **3x3 squares:**  Similar to the 2x2 squares, there are 4 possible 3x3 squares within the grid, and each can be shifted one spot to the right or down, giving us 4*3 = 12 possible 3x3 squares.\n* **4x4 squares:**  There are 4 possible 4x4 squares within the grid, and each can be shifted one spot to the right or down, giving us 4*3 = 12 possible 4x4 squares.\n* **5x5 squares:** There is only 1 possible 5x5 square.\n**2. Total Squares**\nAdd up the number of squares of each size: 16 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 1 = **53**\n**Therefore, there are 53 squares with all four vertices on the 5 by 5 rectangular grid of dots.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1.  Consider the size of the squares:**\n* **1x1 squares:** There are 16 of these, as each dot can be a corner of a 1x1 square.\n* **2x2 squares:**  There are 9 of these. Imagine a 2x2 grid within the larger grid. You can move this 2x2 grid around, and there are 9 possible positions.\n* **3x3 squares:** There are 4 of these, using the same logic as above.\n* **4x4 squares:** There is 1 of these, the largest square possible within the grid.\n**2. Total squares:**\nAdding up the number of squares of each size, we have a total of 16 + 9 + 4 + 1 = **30 squares**. \n",
        "Here's how to find the number of squares:\n* **1x1 Squares:** There are 16 of these, as each dot can be the corner of a 1x1 square.\n* **2x2 Squares:** Imagine sliding a 2x2 square across the grid. You can move it 3 spaces horizontally and 3 spaces vertically, giving you 3 * 3 = 9 squares.\n* **3x3 Squares:**  Similarly, a 3x3 square can be moved 2 spaces horizontally and 2 spaces vertically, resulting in 2 * 2 = 4 squares.\n* **4x4 Squares:** There's only 1 possible 4x4 square.\n**Total:**  16 + 9 + 4 + 1 = **30 squares** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n* **Think about the side lengths:**  A square on this grid can have sides of length 1, 2, 3, or 4 units.\n* **Count the squares of each size:**\n    * **Side length 1:** There are 16 squares with side length 1 (each dot is a corner of one of these squares).\n    * **Side length 2:** There are 9 squares with side length 2. (Think about how many different positions you can place a 2x2 square on the grid).\n    * **Side length 3:** There are 4 squares with side length 3.\n    * **Side length 4:** There is 1 square with side length 4.\n* **Add them up:** 16 + 9 + 4 + 1 = **30**\n**Therefore, there are 30 squares with all four vertices on the 5 by 5 grid.** \n",
