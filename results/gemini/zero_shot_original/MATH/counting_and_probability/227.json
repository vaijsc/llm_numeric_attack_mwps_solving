    "problem": "How many ways are there to put 5 balls in 3 boxes if the balls are distinguishable and the boxes are distinguishable?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are 3 different boxes, so each of the 5 balls can be placed in three different locations.  So the answer is $3^5 = \\boxed{243}$.",

        "Here's how to break down the problem:\n**Understanding the Problem**\n* **Distinguishable balls:**  Each ball is unique (e.g., they could be different colors).\n* **Distinguishable boxes:** Each box is different (e.g., they could be labeled A, B, and C).\n**Solution**\n1. **Consider the first ball:** It has 3 choices (it can go into box A, B, or C).\n2. **Consider the second ball:** It also has 3 choices (it can go into box A, B, or C).\n3. **Continue for the remaining balls:**  Each ball has 3 choices.\n4. **Total possibilities:** Since we have 5 balls, we multiply the number of choices for each ball: 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 3^5 = 243\n**Therefore, there are 243 ways to put 5 distinguishable balls into 3 distinguishable boxes.** \n",
