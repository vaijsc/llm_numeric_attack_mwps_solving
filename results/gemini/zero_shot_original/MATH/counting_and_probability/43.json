        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Identify the Even Primes:**\n* The only even prime number is 2. \n**2. Identify the Possible Outcomes:**\n* A standard die has six sides, with numbers 1 through 6.\n**3. Determine the Outcomes That Are Not Even Primes:**\n*  1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are not even primes.\n**4. Calculate the Probability:**\n* There are 5 outcomes that are not even primes.\n* There are 6 total possible outcomes.\n* Probability = (Favorable Outcomes) / (Total Possible Outcomes) = 5/6\n**Therefore, the probability of rolling a number that is not an even prime is 5/6.** \n",

        "Here's how to break down the problem:\n**1. Prime Numbers:**\n* Prime numbers are whole numbers greater than 1 that are only divisible by 1 and themselves. The prime numbers on a standard die are 2, 3, and 5.\n**2. Even Prime Numbers:**\n* The only even prime number is 2. \n**3. Not an Even Prime:**\n* This means we want the probability of rolling any number *except* 2.\n**4. Probability:**\n* There are 6 possible outcomes when rolling a die. \n* There's 1 outcome we don't want (rolling a 2).\n* That leaves 5 outcomes we *do* want (rolling a 1, 3, 4, 5, or 6).\n**Therefore, the probability of rolling a number that is not an even prime is 5/6.** \n",

        "Here's how to break down the problem:\n**1. Understand the Basics:**\n* **Standard Die:** A standard six-sided die has faces numbered 1 through 6.\n* **Prime Numbers:**  Prime numbers are whole numbers greater than 1 that are only divisible by 1 and themselves (e.g., 2, 3, 5, 7, 11).\n* **Even Numbers:**  Even numbers are whole numbers that are divisible by 2 (e.g., 2, 4, 6).\n**2. Identify the Even Primes:**\nThe only even prime number is 2.\n**3. Find the Non-Even Primes:**\nThe prime numbers on a standard die are 2, 3, and 5.  Of these, only 3 and 5 are not even.\n**4. Calculate the Probability:**\n* **Favorable Outcomes:**  There are 2 favorable outcomes (rolling a 3 or a 5).\n* **Total Possible Outcomes:**  There are 6 possible outcomes (rolling any number from 1 to 6).\n**Probability = (Favorable Outcomes) / (Total Possible Outcomes) = 2/6 = 1/3**\n**Therefore, the probability of rolling a number that is not an even prime is 1/3.** \n"
