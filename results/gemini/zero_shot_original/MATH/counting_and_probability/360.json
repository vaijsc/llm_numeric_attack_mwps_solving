    "problem": "A blue plane, a red plane and a white plane are waiting to take off from an airport that has two runways. Planes must take off from the airport one at a time, but can take off from either runway. In how many ways can the three takeoffs be scheduled? (One such way is the blue plane on runway A, followed by the red plane on runway B, followed by the white plane on runway B.)",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are 3 ways to choose the first plane and 2 ways to choose where it takes off. Similarly, there are 2 ways to choose the second plane after the first has taken off and 2 ways to choose where it takes off, as well as 1 way to choose the last plane and 2 ways to choose its runway. These multiply to a total of $3\\cdot2\\cdot2\\cdot2\\cdot1\\cdot2=3\\cdot2^4=\\boxed{48}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Choosing the first plane:**\n* There are 3 choices for which plane takes off first (blue, red, or white).\n**2. Choosing the runway for the first plane:**\n* There are 2 choices for which runway the first plane uses (runway A or runway B).\n**3. Choosing the second plane:**\n* After the first plane takes off, there are only 2 planes left.\n**4. Choosing the runway for the second plane:**\n* There are 2 choices for the runway the second plane uses.\n**5. Choosing the third plane:**\n* There's only 1 plane left to take off.\n**6. Choosing the runway for the third plane:**\n* There are 2 choices for the runway the third plane uses.\n**To find the total number of ways, we multiply the number of choices at each step:**\n3 choices * 2 choices * 2 choices * 2 choices * 1 choice * 2 choices = **24**\n**Therefore, there are 24 different ways to schedule the three takeoffs.** \n",
        "Here's how we can break down the solution:\n* **Step 1: Choosing the first plane**  We have 3 options for which plane takes off first (blue, red, or white).\n* **Step 2: Choosing the runway for the first plane**  We have 2 options for the first plane (runway A or runway B).\n* **Step 3: Choosing the second plane** We have 2 planes remaining, so we have 2 options for which plane takes off second.\n* **Step 4: Choosing the runway for the second plane** We again have 2 options (runway A or runway B).\n* **Step 5: Choosing the third plane** Only one plane remains, so we have 1 option.\n* **Step 6: Choosing the runway for the third plane** We again have 2 options.\nTo find the total number of ways, we multiply the number of options at each step: 3 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 1 * 2 = **48**\n**Therefore, there are 48 ways to schedule the three takeoffs.** \n",
