    "solution": "Of the 5 boxes with pencils, 2 have pens also, so $5-2=3$ have pencils only.

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n1. **Start with the total:** Roslyn has 10 boxes.\n2. **Focus on the overlap:** Two boxes contain both pens and pencils. This is important because it means we can't simply add the number of pen boxes and pencil boxes.\n3. **Find the total boxes with pens:**  We know 4 boxes contain pens, but 2 of those also contain pencils. This means there are 4 - 2 = 2 boxes with only pens.\n4. **Find the total boxes with pencils:** Similarly, there are 5 - 2 = 3 boxes with only pencils.\n5. **Add up the boxes with pens and pencils:** We have 2 boxes with only pens + 3 boxes with only pencils + 2 boxes with both = 7 boxes.\n6. **Subtract to find the remaining boxes:** Roslyn has 10 boxes total - 7 boxes with pens or pencils = 3 boxes with neither.\n**Answer:** There are **3** boxes that contain neither pens nor pencils. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n1. **Start with the total boxes:** Roslyn has 10 boxes.\n2. **Consider the overlap:** Two boxes contain both pens and pencils. This overlap is important because we don't want to count these boxes twice.\n3. **Pens only:** Since 4 boxes contain pens, and 2 of those also contain pencils, there are 4 - 2 = 2 boxes that contain only pens.\n4. **Pencils only:** Similarly, there are 5 - 2 = 3 boxes that contain only pencils.\n5. **Total with pens or pencils:**  We have 2 (pens only) + 3 (pencils only) + 2 (both) = 7 boxes that contain either pens or pencils.\n6. **Boxes with neither:**  Finally, 10 (total boxes) - 7 (boxes with pens or pencils) = 3 boxes contain neither pens nor pencils.\n**Answer:** There are **3** boxes that contain neither pens nor pencils. \n",

This is important because it means we've counted those boxes twice (once for pens and once for pencils).\n3. **Adjust for the overlap:**  \n    * Pens: We know there are 4 boxes with pens, but 2 of those are already counted in the \"both\" category.
