    "problem": "In how many ways can a President, Vice-President, and Treasurer be chosen from a group of $4$ guys and $4$ girls and at least one girl and at least one guy holds at least one of those three positions? One person cannot serve in more than one position.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "We have $8$ choices for president, $7$ choices for vice-president, and $6$ choices for treasurer, for a total of $8\\times7\\times6 = 336$ choices. Now we have to subtract the number of choices that don't satisfy the requirement, where the $3$ officers are all boys or all girls. For either case, we have $4$ choices for president, $3$ choices of vice-president, and $2$ choices for treasurer, a total of $4\\times3\\times2 = 24$ choices. So we have $2\\times 24 = 48$ total choices that don't satisfy the requirement.\n\nThus, there are $336-48=\\boxed{288}$ good choices.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Total Possible Arrangements (Without Restrictions)**\n* There are 8 people, so for President, we have 8 choices.\n* After choosing the President, we have 7 people left for Vice-President.\n* Finally, we have 6 people remaining for Treasurer.\nSo, the total number of ways to choose a President, Vice-President, and Treasurer without any restrictions is 8 * 7 * 6 = 336.\n**2. Arrangements Where Only Guys Hold Positions**\n* There are 4 guys, so for President, we have 4 choices.\n* For Vice-President, we have 3 choices left.\n* For Treasurer, we have 2 choices left.\nThis gives us 4 * 3 * 2 = 24 arrangements where only guys hold positions.\n**3. Arrangements Where Only Girls Hold Positions**\n* This follows the same logic as step 2. There are 4 * 3 * 2 = 24 arrangements where only girls hold positions.\n**4. Arrangements with At Least One Girl and One Guy**\nTo find the number of arrangements with at least one girl and one guy, we subtract the invalid arrangements from the total arrangements:\n* 336 (total arrangements) - 24 (only guys) - 24 (only girls) = 288 \n**Therefore, there are 288 ways to choose a President, Vice-President, and Treasurer from the group with at least one girl and one guy holding a position.** \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem:\n**1.  Calculate the total possible arrangements without restrictions:**\n* There are 8 people, so for President we have 8 choices.\n* For Vice-President, we have 7 choices left.\n* For Treasurer, we have 6 choices left.\nThis gives us a total of 8 * 7 * 6 = 336 possible arrangements.\n**2.  Calculate the number of arrangements with only girls or only guys:**\n* **Only girls:**  4 * 3 * 2 = 24 arrangements\n* **Only guys:** 4 * 3 * 2 = 24 arrangements\n**3.  Subtract the invalid arrangements from the total:**\nThe number of arrangements with at least one girl and at least one boy is:\n336 (total) - 24 (all girls) - 24 (all boys) = **288**\n**Therefore, there are 288 ways to choose a President, Vice-President, and Treasurer with at least one girl and at least one boy holding a position.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Total Possible Combinations (Ignoring Restrictions)**\n* If there were no restrictions, we could choose the President in 8 ways, the Vice-President in 7 ways, and the Treasurer in 6 ways.\n* This gives us a total of 8 * 7 * 6 = 336 possible combinations.\n**2. Combinations Where All Positions are Held by the Same Gender**\n* **All Guys:** We have 4 options for President, 3 for Vice-President, and 2 for Treasurer, giving us 4 * 3 * 2 = 24 combinations.\n* **All Girls:** The same logic applies, giving us another 24 combinations.\n**3.  Calculate Valid Combinations (At Least One Girl and One Boy)**\n* To find the number of combinations with at least one girl and one boy, subtract the invalid combinations (all guys or all girls) from the total number of combinations.\n* Valid combinations: 336 - 24 - 24 = 288\n**Therefore, there are 288 ways to choose a President, Vice-President, and Treasurer with at least one girl and one boy holding a position.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Total Possible Combinations (Without Restrictions):**\n* We have 8 people and need to choose 3 positions. This can be done in  \u2078C\u2083 ways (8 choose 3): \u2078C\u2083 = (8 * 7 * 6) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 56 ways.\n**2. Cases to Exclude:**\n* **All guys:**  We need to exclude the cases where all three positions are filled by guys.  There are \u2074C\u2083 ways to choose 3 guys from 4: \u2074C\u2083 = 4 ways.\n* **All girls:** Similarly, there are \u2074C\u2083 = 4 ways to choose 3 girls from 4.\n**3. Calculate the Final Answer:**\nTo find the number of ways to choose a President, Vice-President, and Treasurer with at least one guy and one girl, we subtract the excluded cases from the total number of combinations:\n56 (total combinations) - 4 (all guys) - 4 (all girls) = **48 ways**\n**Therefore, there are 48 ways to choose a President, Vice-President, and Treasurer with at least one guy and one girl.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Calculate the total possible ways to choose the officers without restrictions:**\n* There are 8 people, and we need to choose 3 of them.  This is a combination problem: \u2078C\u2083 = (8!)/(3!5!) = 56\n**2.  Calculate the number of ways to choose officers where *only* guys hold the positions:**\n* We need to choose 3 guys from 4: \u2074C\u2083 = (4!)/(3!1!) = 4\n**3.  Calculate the number of ways to choose officers where *only* girls hold the positions:**\n* We need to choose 3 girls from 4: \u2074C\u2083 = (4!)/(3!1!) = 4\n**4. Subtract the unwanted cases from the total:**\n* The total number of ways to choose officers with at least one guy and at least one girl is: \n   56 (total ways) - 4 (all guys) - 4 (all girls) = **48**\n**Therefore, there are 48 ways to choose a President, Vice-President, and Treasurer with at least one guy and one girl in the positions.** \n"
