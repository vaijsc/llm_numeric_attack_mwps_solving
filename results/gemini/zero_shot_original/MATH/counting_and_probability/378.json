We check the 6 possibilities for $c$ separately.  If $c=1$, then $a$ is 3 or 8.  If $c=2$, then $a$ is 2 or 7.  If $c=3$, then $a$ is 1 or 6.  If $c=4$, then $a=5$, and if $c=5$, then $a=4$.

Understanding the Problem**\nWe need to find how many pairs of integers (a, b) exist within the given ranges such that the expression  \u221a(a + \u221ab) results in an integer.\n**2.  Analyzing the Expression**\n* **Inner Square Root:**  Since \u221ab needs to be an integer,  'b' must be a perfect square. \n* **Outer Square Root:**  The sum (a + \u221ab) must also be a perfect square for the entire expression to be an integer.\n**3. Finding Possible Values of 'b'**\nThe perfect squares within the range 1 \u2264 b \u2264 36 are: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, and 36.\n**4.  Checking for 'a' Values for Each 'b'**\nLet's examine each value of 'b' and see what values of 'a' would make (a + \u221ab) a perfect square:\n* **b = 1:** (a + 1) needs to be a perfect square.  Possible 'a' values are 0, 3, 8, 15, etc.  Only  'a' = 3 satisfies the condition 1 \u2264 a \u2264 10.\n* **b = 4:** (a + 2) needs to be a perfect square. Possible 'a' values are 1, 7, 15, etc.  Only 'a' = 7 satisfies the condition.\n* **b = 9:** (a + 3) needs to be a perfect square.  Possible 'a' values are 6, 13, etc.  No value of 'a' within the range works.\n* **b = 16:** (a + 4) needs to be a perfect square.

Possible 'a' values are 4, 11, etc.  No value of 'a' within the range works.\n* **b = 36:** (a + 6) needs to be a perfect square. Possible 'a' values are 3, 10, etc.  Only 'a' = 3 satisfies the condition.\n**5. Counting the Solutions**\nWe found three valid ordered pairs: (3, 1), (7, 4), and (3, 36).\n**Answer:** There are **3** ordered pairs of integers (a, b) that satisfy the given conditions. \n",

Understanding the Problem:**\nWe need to find how many pairs of integers (a, b) exist where:\n*  1 \u2264 a \u2264 10 \n*  1 \u2264 b \u2264 36\n*  The expression \u221a(a + \u221ab) is also an integer.\n**2. Focusing on the Inner Square Root:**\nSince \u221ab is inside another square root, it must be a perfect square itself.  This means 'b' can only take on values that are perfect squares between 1 and 36.  \n**3. Finding Possible Values of b:**\nThe perfect squares between 1 and 36 are: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, and 36.\n**4. Checking Values of a:**\nNow, for each of these values of 'b', we need to see if we can find an 'a' (between 1 and 10) such that a + \u221ab is also a perfect square.\n* **b = 1:**  a + \u221a1 = a + 1  must be a perfect square.  This is possible for a = 3 (giving 4), a = 8 (giving 9), and a = 15 (but 15 is outside our range). \n* **b = 4:** a + \u221a4 = a + 2 must be a perfect square. This is possible for a = 2 (giving 4), a = 7 (giving 9), and a = 12 (but 12 is outside our range).\n* **b = 9:** a + \u221a9 = a + 3 must be a perfect square. This is possible for a = 1 (giving 4), a = 6 (giving 9), and a = 11 (but 11 is outside our range).\n* **b = 16:** a + \u221a16 = a + 4 must be a perfect square. This is possible for a = 5 (giving 9) and a = 10 (giving 14).\n* **b = 25:** a + \u221a25 = a + 5 must be a perfect square.

Let's consider each case:\n* **b = 1:**  a + 1 could be a perfect square if a = 0, 3, 8 (giving 1, 4, 9).
