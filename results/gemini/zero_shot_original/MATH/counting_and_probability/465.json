    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are $2^6 = 64$ possible outcomes, since each of the 6 coins has 2 possibilities.  If we do not get at least 2 heads, then we get either no heads or one heads.  There is only 1 way to get 0 heads, and $\\binom{6}{1} = 6$ ways to get 1 head, so the probability of getting at most one head is $\\dfrac{7}{64}$.  Therefore, the probability of getting at least 2 heads is $1-\\dfrac{7}{64}=\\boxed{\\frac{57}{64}}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step by step:\n**1.  Calculate the Total Possible Outcomes**\n* Each coin has 2 possible outcomes (heads or tails).\n* With 6 coins, the total number of possible outcomes is 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 2\u2076 = 64.\n**2. Calculate the Outcomes We Don't Want**\n* We want at least 2 heads. This means we need to find the probability of getting 0, 1, or 2 heads, and subtract that from 1.\n* **0 heads:**  There's only one way to get all tails (TTTTTT).\n* **1 head:** There are 6 ways to get one head (HTTTTT, THTTTT, TTHTTT, etc.).\n* **2 heads:**  We'll come back to this in the next step.\n**3.  Calculate Outcomes With 2 Heads (using combinations)**\n* We have 6 coins and want to choose 2 of them to be heads.  This is a combination problem, and we can use the following formula:\n   * **nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)** \n   * Where 'n' is the total number of items and 'r' is the number you are choosing.\n* In this case, n = 6 (coins) and r = 2 (heads):\n   * 6C2 = 6! / (2! * (6-2)!)\n   * 6C2 = 720 / (2 * 24)\n   * 6C2 = 15\n**4.  Calculate the Probability of At Least 2 Heads**\n*  Probability of 0 heads: 1/64\n*  Probability of 1 head: 6/64\n*  Probability of 2 heads: 15/64\n*  Probability of 0, 1, or 2 heads: (1 + 6 + 15) / 64 = 22/64\n*  Probability of at least 2 heads: 1 - (22/64) = **42/64 = 21/32**\n**Therefore, the probability of getting at least 2 heads when flipping 6 coins is 21/32.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Consider all possible outcomes:**\n* Each coin has 2 possible outcomes: Heads (H) or Tails (T).\n* With 6 coins, there are 2^6 = 64 possible combinations.\n**2. Calculate the probability of getting 0, 1, or 2 heads:**\n* **0 heads (all tails):**  There's only 1 way to get this (TTTTTT). Probability: 1/64\n* **1 head:** There are 6 ways to get this (HTTTTT, THTTTT, TTHTTT, etc.). Probability: 6/64\n* **2 heads:** There are 15 ways to get this (HHTTTT, HTHTTT, etc.). Probability: 15/64\n**3. Calculate the probability of getting at least 2 heads:**\nSince these outcomes are mutually exclusive (they can't happen at the same time), we can simply add the probabilities:\n* Probability of at least 2 heads = Probability of 2 heads + Probability of 3 heads + Probability of 4 heads + Probability of 5 heads + Probability of 6 heads \n*  We already know the probabilities for 0, 1, and 2 heads.  To make things easier, we can calculate the probability of NOT getting at least 2 heads, which is the probability of getting 0, 1, or 2 heads. Then, we can subtract that probability from 1 to get the probability of at least 2 heads.\n* Probability of NOT getting at least 2 heads = 1/64 + 6/64 + 15/64 = 22/64\n* Probability of getting at least 2 heads = 1 - 22/64 = 42/64 = 21/32\n**Therefore, the probability of getting at least 2 heads when flipping 6 coins is 21/32.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Calculate the total possible outcomes:**\n* Each coin has 2 possible outcomes (heads or tails).\n* With 6 coins, the total number of possible outcomes is 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 2\u2076 = 64\n**2. Calculate the probability of getting 0, 1, or 2 heads:**\n* **0 heads:** Only one outcome (all tails) - probability is 1/64\n* **1 head:** 6 possible outcomes (one head, the rest tails) - probability is 6/64\n* **2 heads:**  15 possible outcomes (we'll figure this out later) - probability is 15/64\n**3. Calculate the probability of getting 2 heads:**\n* We need to figure out how many ways to get exactly 2 heads. This is a combination problem: 6 choose 2 (written as \u2076C\u2082 or 6!/(2!4!)).\n* \u2076C\u2082 = (6 * 5) / (2 * 1) = 15\n**4. Calculate the probability of getting at least 2 heads:**\n* The easiest way to find the probability of getting *at least* 2 heads is to calculate the probability of getting *less than* 2 heads and subtract it from 1 (since the probabilities of all possible outcomes must add up to 1).\n* Probability of getting less than 2 heads = (1/64) + (6/64) = 7/64\n* Probability of getting at least 2 heads = 1 - (7/64) = **57/64**\n**Therefore, the probability of getting at least 2 heads when flipping 6 coins is 57/64.** \n",
        "Here's how to calculate the probability of getting at least 2 heads when flipping 6 coins:\n**1.  Calculate the Probability of Getting Less Than 2 Heads**\n* **0 Heads (All Tails):**  The probability of getting tails on a single flip is 1/2.  For six tails in a row, it's (1/2) ^ 6 = 1/64.\n* **1 Head:**  There are six ways this can happen (HTTTTT, THTTTT, TTHTTT, etc.). Each of these combinations has a probability of (1/2)^6 = 1/64. So the total probability of getting one head is 6 * (1/64) = 6/64.\n**2. Calculate the Probability of Getting At Least 2 Heads**\n* **Total Probability:** The probability of all possible outcomes must add up to 1. \n* **Subtract:** The probability of getting at least 2 heads is 1 minus the probability of getting less than 2 heads: \n   1 - (1/64) - (6/64) = 57/64\n**Therefore, the probability of getting at least 2 heads when flipping 6 coins is 57/64.** \n",
        "Here's how to break down the probability of getting at least 2 heads when flipping 6 coins:\n**1. Understand the Possibilities:**\n* Each coin has 2 possible outcomes: Heads (H) or Tails (T).\n* With 6 coins, there are 2^6 = 64 total possible outcomes.\n**2.  Calculate the Unfavorable Outcomes:**\n* We want \"at least 2 heads,\" so the unfavorable outcomes are 0 heads or 1 head.\n* **0 heads:** There's only 1 way to get all tails (TTTTTT).\n* **1 head:**  There are 6 ways to get one head (HTTTTT, THTTTT, TTHTTT, etc.).\n**3. Calculate the Favorable Outcomes:**\n*  Favorable outcomes are the total outcomes minus the unfavorable outcomes. \n*  Favorable outcomes = 64 - 1 - 6 = 57\n**4.
