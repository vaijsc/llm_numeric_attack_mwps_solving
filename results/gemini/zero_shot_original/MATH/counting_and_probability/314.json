    "solution": "There are 3 possible prime numbers which can be rolled (2, 3, and 5), and two possible composite numbers which can be rolled (4 and 6). Each number has a $\\dfrac{1}{6}$ chance of being rolled. So, the expected value of Beth's winnings is $$\\frac{3}{6}(1)+\\frac{2}{6}(-1)+\\frac{1}{6}(0)=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$$",

        "Here's how to calculate the expected value:\n**1. Identify the possible outcomes and their probabilities:**\n* **Prime Number (2, 3, 5):** Probability = 3/6 = 1/2\n* **Composite Number (4, 6):** Probability = 2/6 = 1/3\n* **One:** Probability = 1/6\n**2. Determine the value of each outcome:**\n* **Prime Number:** Win $1\n* **Composite Number:** Lose $1 (or win -$1)\n* **One:** No change ($0)\n**3. Calculate the expected value:**\nExpected Value = (Probability of Outcome 1 * Value of Outcome 1) + (Probability of Outcome 2 * Value of Outcome 2) + (Probability of Outcome 3 * Value of Outcome 3)\nExpected Value = (1/2 * $1) + (1/3 * -$1) + (1/6 * $0) \nExpected Value = $1/2 - $1/3 + $0 \nExpected Value = **$1/6** \n**Therefore, the expected value of Beth's winnings is $1/6.** \n",

Determine the Probabilities:**\n* **Prime Number:** 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 total outcomes = 3/6 = 1/2 probability\n* **Composite Number:** 2 favorable outcomes out of 6 total outcomes = 2/6 = 1/3 probability\n* **Neither:** 1 favorable outcome out of 6 total outcomes = 1/6 probability\n**3. Calculate the Expected Value for Each Outcome:**\n* **Prime Number:** (1/2) * $1 = $0.50\n* **Composite Number:** (1/3) * -$1 = -$0.33 \n* **Neither:** (1/6) * $0 = $0\n**4. Add the Expected Values Together:**\n$0.50 - $0.33 + $0 = $0.17\n**Answer:** The expected value of the amount of money Beth will win is **1/6** dollar. \n",
