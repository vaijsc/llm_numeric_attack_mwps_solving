        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n* **Independent Events:** The outcome of the president election is independent of the outcome of the vice president election. This means the results of one don't affect the other.\n* **Probability of Dan Winning:**  Dan has a 1/2 (50%) chance of winning the president election.\n* **Probability of Freddie Winning:** Freddie has a 1/2 (50%) chance of winning the vice president election.\n* **Probability of Both Winning:** To find the probability of both events happening, we multiply the probabilities of each individual event:\n   (1/2) * (1/2) = **1/4**\n**Therefore, the probability of both Dan and Freddie winning is 1/4.** \n",
