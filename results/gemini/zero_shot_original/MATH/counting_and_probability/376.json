    "solution": "$\\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$. In order for this fraction to be odd, neither $n$ nor $n-1$ can be divisible by $4$, because only one of $n$ and $n-1$ can be even. There are $25$ integers where $n$ is divisible by $4$, namely the multiples of $4$ from $4$ to $100$. There are $24$ integers where $n-1$ is divisible by $4$. We can obtain these integers by incrementing all the multiples of $4$ by $1$, but we must not include $100$ since $100+1 = 101 > 100$. Therefore, there are $49$ invalid integers, so there are $99 - 49 = \\boxed{50}$ valid integers.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**Understanding the Problem**\n* **Binomial Coefficient:**  The binomial coefficient $\\binom{n}{2}$ represents the number of ways to choose 2 objects from a set of *n* objects.  It's calculated as $\\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{n!}{2!(n-2)!}$.\n* **Odd Numbers:** We need to find the values of *n* that make $\\binom{n}{2}$ an odd number.\n**Solution**\n1. **Factorial Analysis:** Let's examine the factorial part of the binomial coefficient:\n   *  $n! = n(n-1)(n-2)...2 \\cdot 1$\n   *  $2! = 2 \\cdot 1$\n   *  $(n-2)! = (n-2)(n-3)...2 \\cdot 1$\n2. **Canceling Terms:** Notice that most of the terms in the numerator and denominator of $\\binom{n}{2}$ cancel out:\n   *  $\\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)!}{2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (n-2)!} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$\n3. **Oddness:** For $\\binom{n}{2}$ to be odd,  $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ must be odd.  This means:\n   *  *n* and *(n-1)* must both be even. \n   *  Only one of *n* or *(n-1)* can be a multiple of 4 (otherwise the result would be even).\n4. **Finding Solutions:** \n   *  Since *n* and *(n-1)* are consecutive integers, one must be even and the other odd.  \n   *  To make both even, *n* must be a multiple of 4.\n   *  The multiples of 4 between 2 and 100 are: 4, 8, 12, ... 100.\n   *  There are 25 multiples of 4 in this range.\n**Answer:** There are **25** integers *n* between 2 and 100 for which $\\binom{n}{2}$ is odd. \n",

Their product is even.\n* If *n* is odd, then (n-1) is even. Their product is even.\n**Conclusion**\nTherefore, there are **no** integers *n* between 2 and 100 for which $\\binom{n}{2}$ is odd. \n",
