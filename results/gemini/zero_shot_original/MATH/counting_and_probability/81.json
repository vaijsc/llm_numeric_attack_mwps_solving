        "This expression looks complicated, but it has a very nice pattern!  Notice that it's almost the expansion of  $(82 + 18)^3$. Let's see why:\n* **The pattern:** The expression resembles the cube of a binomial: $(a + b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3$.\n* **Matching terms:**  If we let $a = 82$ and $b = 18$, the terms in our expression perfectly match the terms in the expansion of $(a + b)^3$.\n**Therefore:**\n$82^3 + 3(82^2)(18) + 3(82)(18^2) + 18^3 = (82 + 18)^3 = 100^3 = \\boxed{1,000,000}$. \n",
