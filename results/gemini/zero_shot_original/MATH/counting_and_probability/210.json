    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The first digit can be any one of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6. Whatever the first digit is, that fixes what the units digit can be.  If we are going to have an even integer, the units digit must be even.  This restricts the first digit to 2, 4 or 6.  Then, there are 10 choices for the next (thousands) digit. That fixes what the tens digit can be.  Finally, there are 10 choices for the third (hundreds) digit.  So, we can construct $3\\times10\\times10= \\boxed{300}$ palindromes by choosing the digits.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understanding Palindromes**\nA palindrome is a number that reads the same backward as forward.  For example, 12321 is a palindrome.\n**2. Even Palindromes**\nAn even palindrome must end in an even digit.  This means the first and last digits must be the same and even. \n**3.  Range of Possibilities**\n* **First digit:** It can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. (Since the number must be between 10,000 and 70,000)\n* **Last digit:**  It must be the same as the first digit.\n* **Middle digits:** Since the number is a palindrome, the middle two digits must be the same.  \n**4. Counting the Possibilities**\n* **First digit:** We have 6 choices.\n* **Second digit:** We have 10 choices (0-9).\n* **Third digit:** We have 1 choice (it must be the same as the second digit).\n* **Fourth digit:** We have 1 choice (it must be the same as the first digit).\n**5. Calculation**\nTo find the total number of even palindromes, we multiply the number of choices for each digit:\n6 choices * 10 choices * 1 choice * 1 choice = 60\n**Therefore, there are 60 even palindromes between 10,000 and 70,000.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understanding Palindromes**\nA palindrome is a number that reads the same backward as forward. For example: 121, 353, 42524.\n**2.  Even Palindromes**\nAn even palindrome must end in an even digit. Since we're looking at numbers between 10,000 and 70,000, the last digit must be 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.\n**3.  Building the Palindromes**\n* **Start with the last digit:**  Let's consider each possible even last digit.\n* **Middle digit:**  Since the number is a palindrome, the first digit must be the same as the last digit. The middle digit can be any of the 10 digits (0-9).\n* **Remaining digits:** The second and fourth digits must mirror each other.\n**4.  Counting the Possibilities**\nLet's break down the possibilities based on the last digit:\n* **Last digit = 0:**  There's only 1 choice for the first digit (0), 10 choices for the middle digit, and 10 choices for the second (and fourth) digit. This gives us 1 * 10 * 10 = 100 palindromes.\n* **Last digit = 2, 4, 6, or 8:** There are 4 choices for the last digit.  For each of these, there's only 1 choice for the first digit, 10 choices for the middle digit, and 10 choices for the second (and fourth) digit. This gives us 4 * 1 * 10 * 10 = 400 palindromes.\n**5.  Total Palindromes**\nAdding up the possibilities for each last digit, we have a total of 100 + 400 = **500** even palindromes between 10,000 and 70,000. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand Palindromes:**\n* A palindrome is a number that reads the same backward as forward (e.g., 121, 3553, 42524).\n**2.  Even Palindromes in the Range:**\n* **Structure:** Since the number must be even and a palindrome, the last digit (and the first digit) must be even.\n* **Possible First Digits:**  The first digit can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 (to keep the number between 10,000 and 70,000). \n* **Possible Second Digits:** The second digit can be any of the ten digits (0-9).  The third digit is then determined by the second digit (to make it a palindrome).\n**3.  Counting the Palindromes:**\n* We have 6 choices for the first digit and 10 choices for the second digit.  This gives us 6 * 10 = 60 possible even palindromes in the range.\n**Therefore, there are 60 even palindromes between 10,000 and 70,000.** \n",
