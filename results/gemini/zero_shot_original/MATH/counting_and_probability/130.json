    "solution": "We start with the numbers that start with 1.  There are 4 ways to pick the next digit, then 3 ways to pick the third digit, 2 ways to pick the fourth, and 1 to pick the last.  Therefore, there are $4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1=24$ integers with 1 as the first digit.  Similarly, another 24 have 2 as the first digit. That's 48 numbers so far, so we want the second smallest number that starts with 3.  The smallest is 31245, and the next smallest is $\\boxed{31254}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Smallest Numbers:**\n* The smallest five-digit number you can form using these digits is 12345.\n**2. Finding the Pattern:**\n* Notice that to get the next smallest number, we need to swap the '2' and '3'. This gives us 13245.\n* To get the next, we swap the '3' and '4', giving us 13425.\n* Continuing this pattern, we're essentially listing out all the permutations (arrangements) of the digits after the first digit (1).\n**3. Counting Permutations:**\n* There are 4! (4 factorial) ways to arrange the remaining 4 digits. \n* 4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24\n**4. Finding the 50th Number:**\n* Since there are 24 numbers for each starting digit, the first 48 numbers will start with a '1'. \n* The 49th number will be 21345.\n* The 50th number will be **21435**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Smallest Numbers:**\n* The smallest possible five-digit number using these digits is 12345.\n**2.  Counting the Possibilities**\n* **Start with the thousands digit:**  There are 5 choices for the thousands digit (1, 2, 3, 4, or 5).\n* **Then the hundreds digit:** Once the thousands digit is chosen, there are 4 remaining choices for the hundreds digit.\n* **Continuing:**  There are 3 choices for the tens digit, 2 choices for the units digit, and only 1 choice left for the final digit.\n**3.  Total Number of Possibilities:**\n* The total number of five-digit numbers we can create is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120\n**4. Finding the 50th Number:**\n* Since we have 120 numbers in total, the 50th number will be somewhere in the middle of the list. \n*  Let's think about how the numbers are ordered.  The numbers will be ordered based on the thousands digit first, then the hundreds digit, and so on.\n**5.  Finding the Pattern:**\n* **Numbers starting with 1:**  There will be 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24 numbers starting with 1. \n* **Numbers starting with 2:**  There will be 24 numbers starting with 2.\n* **The 50th number:**  The 50th number will be one of the numbers starting with 2.  Since 24 numbers start with 1, and 24 start with 2, we need the 26th number in the list of numbers starting with 2. \n* **Working with the remaining digits:**  We want the 26th number using the digits 1, 3, 4, and 5. The smallest number we can make is 21345, and the 26th number will have the hundreds digit as 4.\n**6. The Answer:**\nThe 50th number in the list is **24135**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Smallest Numbers**\n* The smallest possible five-digit number using these digits is 12345.\n* To find the next smallest, we need to increase the tens digit.  The next smallest number is 12354.\n**2.  Pattern Recognition**\n* Notice that the numbers are being generated in a systematic way.  We're essentially cycling through the digits in the last four positions, keeping the first digit fixed. \n* This means we'll have a group of 4! (4 factorial) = 24 numbers starting with 1.\n**3.  Finding the 50th Number**\n* Since we have 24 numbers starting with 1, the next 24 numbers will start with 2 (21345, 21354, etc.).\n* This means the 48th number in the list will be 23541.\n* The 49th number is 23514.\n* The 50th number is **23415**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Smallest Numbers**\n* The smallest five-digit number we can form is 12345.\n**2.  Finding the Pattern**\n* To get the next smallest number, we need to swap the '1' and the '2' (giving us 21345). \n* Notice that we can continue to swap the digits to the left of the '3' to get the next numbers in our sequence.\n**3.  Counting the Numbers**\n* We can make 4! (4 factorial) different numbers by rearranging the digits to the left of the '3' (since there are 4 positions). This is because we have 4 choices for the first digit, then 3 choices for the second, then 2 choices for the third, and finally 1 choice for the last digit. \n* 4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24\n**4.  Moving to the Next Block**\n* After the 24 numbers starting with '1', we move on to numbers starting with '2'.  We can again form 24 numbers using the same logic.\n* The same applies to numbers starting with '3', '4', and '5'. \n**5.  Finding the 50th Number**\n* Since we can create 24 numbers for each of the 5 possible starting digits, we have a total of 5 * 24 = 120 numbers.\n* The 50th number will fall in the block of numbers starting with '3'.\n* To find the specific number, we need to determine which number within the '3' block is the 26th number (since 50 - 24 = 26).\n* Since we can form 24 numbers with '3' as the first digit, the 26th number starting with '3' will be the second number within that block. \n* This number is 31245.\n**Therefore, the 50th integer in the list is 31245.** \n",

Pattern Recognition**\n* Notice that the digits after the first two (3, 4, 5) remain in ascending order. This will always be the case as we generate numbers.\n* To get the next smallest number, we swap the '1' and the '3': 13245\n* Continue swapping the first two digits, keeping the rest in order.\n**3. Finding the 50th Number**\n* **First 10 numbers:** These will involve swapping the '1' with each of the other digits (2, 3, 4, and 5).\n* **Next 10 numbers:** Swap the '2' with each of the other digits (1, 3, 4, and 5).\n* **And so on...**\n* You'll notice a pattern: each digit in the first position gets swapped with the other four digits, creating a block of 10 numbers.\n**4. Calculating the 50th Number**\n* Since we have blocks of 10 numbers, the 50th number will fall in the block where the '4' is the first digit. \n*  To get the specific number within that block, we need to determine how many numbers into the block the 50th number is. \n*  50th number - (4 blocks of 10 numbers) = 10.  This means it's the 10th number in the block where '4' is first.\n*  The 10th number in that block will have '5' as the second digit.\n**Therefore, the 50th number in the list is 45123.** \n"
