    "problem": "Liz has 11 marbles of different colors. In how many ways can she choose 3 of the marbles, if she refuses to choose the green one and the purple one at the same time?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "We can divide this into cases:\n\nCase 1: Liz chooses the green marble, and not the purple marble. In this case, Liz must choose 2 more marbles from the remaining 9 marbles (since she won't choose the purple marble). So, there are $\\binom{9}{2}=36$ choices in this case.\n\nCase 2: Liz chooses the purple marble, and not the green marble. As in Case 1, Liz must choose 2 more marbles from the remaining 9 marbles. So, there are $\\binom{9}{2}$ choices in this case.\n\nCase 3: Liz chooses neither the green marble nor the purple marble. In this case, Liz must choose three marbles from the nine remaining marbles, and there are $\\binom{9}{3}=84$ choices in this case.\n\nThe total number of possible choices is $36+36+84=\\boxed{156}$.\n\nAlternatively, there are $\\binom{11}{3}=165$ ways to select three marbles. Of those, $\\binom{9}{1}=9$ ways contain both the purple marble and the green marble. Therefore, there are $165-9=\\boxed{156}$ ways to select three marbles such that purple and green marbles are not both chosen.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Total Possible Combinations:**\n* Liz has 11 marbles, and she wants to choose 3. \n* The total number of ways to choose 3 marbles out of 11 is given by the combination formula:  \u00b9\u00b9C\u2083 = (11!)/(3!8!) = 165.\n**2. Combinations with Green and Purple:**\n* Let's figure out how many combinations include BOTH the green and purple marbles. \n* Since we've already decided to include green and purple, we only need to choose 1 more marble from the remaining 9.\n* This can be done in \u2079C\u2081 = 9 ways.\n**3. Combinations WITHOUT Green and Purple:**\n* To find the number of combinations where Liz doesn't choose both green and purple at the same time, we subtract the combinations containing both from the total number of combinations:\n* 165 (total combinations) - 9 (combinations with green and purple) = 156\n**Answer:** Liz can choose 3 marbles in 156 ways if she refuses to choose both the green and purple marbles at the same time. \n",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Calculate total possible combinations without restrictions:**\n* Liz has 11 marbles and wants to choose 3.  The formula for combinations is nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!), where n is the total number of items and r is the number you're choosing.\n* So, the total number of ways to choose 3 marbles without any restrictions is 11C3 = 11! / (3! * 8!) = 165\n**2. Calculate combinations with both green and purple:**\n* If Liz chooses the green and purple marbles, she has one remaining choice to make from the other 9 marbles. \n* This is simply 9C1 = 9! / (1! * 8!) = 9\n**3. Subtract the unwanted combinations:**\n* Since Liz doesn't want to choose both green and purple together, subtract the combinations that include both from the total number of combinations: 165 - 9 = 156\n**Therefore, there are 156 ways Liz can choose 3 marbles without choosing the green and purple marbles at the same time.** \n"
