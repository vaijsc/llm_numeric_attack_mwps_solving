    "solution": "There are $\\binom{5}{4}$ different ways to choose 4 from 5 upper class soldiers. For each of these, there are $\\binom{10}{8}$ ways to choose 8 lower class soldiers. The number of different battalions, then, is $\\binom{5}{4}\\cdot \\binom{10}{8} = \\boxed{225}$.",

        "Here's how we can solve this problem:\n**1.  Understanding the Requirements:**\n* We need to form battalions with 4 upper class soldiers and 8 lower class soldiers.\n* We have a limited supply of soldiers: 5 upper class and 10 lower class.\n**2.  Upper Class Limitation:**\n* We only have 5 upper class soldiers, but need 4 for each battalion. \n* This means we can only form **one** battalion.\n**3.  Lower Class Limitation:**\n* We have 10 lower class soldiers, and need 8 for each battalion.\n* Since we can only form one battalion due to the upper class limitation, we have enough lower class soldiers.\n**Answer:**\nTherefore, only **one** battalion can be sent to the battle of Thermopylae. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Determine the combinations for upper-class soldiers:**\n* We need 4 upper-class soldiers for the battalion, and we have 5 available. \n* This is a combination problem because the order of selection doesn't matter.\n* The formula for combinations is nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!), where n is the total number of items and r is the number you choose.\n* So, the number of combinations for upper-class soldiers is 5C4 = 5! / (4! * (5-4)!) = 5. \n**2. Determine the combinations for lower-class soldiers:**\n* We need 8 lower-class soldiers for the battalion, and we have 10 available.\n* Using the same formula, the number of combinations for lower-class soldiers is 10C8 = 10! / (8! * (10-8)!) = 45.\n**3. Calculate the total number of battalions:**\n* To get the total number of battalions, multiply the number of combinations for each soldier type: 5 * 45 = 225.\n**Answer:**  There can be **225** different battalions sent to the Battle of Thermopylae. \n",

Consider the Lower-Class Soldiers:**\n* You have 10 lower-class soldiers available.\n* You only need 8.  This means you have enough to fulfill the requirement.\n**4.

Determine the Limiting Factor**\n* **Upper-class soldiers:** Athens has 5, and the battle needs 4. This is not a limiting factor.\n* **Lower-class soldiers:** Athens has 10, and the battle needs 8. This is a limiting factor. \n**3. Figure out the Number of Battalions**\n* Since the lower-class soldiers are the limiting factor, we can only form as many battalions as we have enough lower-class soldiers for.\n* We have 10 lower-class soldiers, and each battalion needs 8.  We can therefore form **1** battalion (10 / 8 = 1 with a remainder).\n**Answer:** Only one battalion can be sent to the battle of Thermopylae. \n",
