    "solution": "If we consider the group of Democrats as one person, then there are $6!$ ways to arrange the 6 people (the 5 Republicans and the one Democrat group). Then there are $4!$ ways to arrange arranging the 4 Democrats within their group.  So the number of arrangements is $6! \\times 4! = \\boxed{17,\\!280}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Treat the Democrats as a Single Unit**\nSince the Democrats must sit together, consider them as a single unit. Now we have 5 Republicans and 1 \"Democrat unit\" to arrange, making a total of 6 entities.\n**2. Arrange the Republicans and the Democrat Unit**\nThese 6 entities can be arranged in 6! (6 factorial) ways: 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720 ways.\n**3. Arrange the Democrats within their Unit**\nThe 4 Democrats within their unit can be arranged in 4! (4 factorial) ways: 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24 ways.\n**4. Combine the Arrangements**\nTo get the total number of arrangements where all the Democrats sit together, we multiply the arrangements from steps 2 and 3:\n720 ways (for Republicans and Democrat unit) * 24 ways (for Democrats within the unit) = **17,280 ways**\n**Therefore, there are 17,280 ways to arrange the committee members with all the Democrats sitting together.** \n",
