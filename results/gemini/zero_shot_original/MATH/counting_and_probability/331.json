        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem**\nWe need to find the number of ways to choose 4 books out of 12, where the order we pick them doesn't matter. This is a classic combination problem.\n**Step 2:  The Formula**\nThe number of ways to choose *r* items from a set of *n* items (where order doesn't matter) is given by the combination formula:\nnCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)\nwhere \"!\" denotes the factorial (e.g., 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)\n**Step 3: Apply the Formula**\nIn our case:\n* n = 12 (total number of books)\n* r = 4 (number of books to choose)\nSo, the number of ways to choose 4 books is:\n12C4 = 12! / (4! * (12-4)!)\n     = 12! / (4! * 8!)\n     = (12 * 11 * 10 * 9) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1)\n     = 495\n**Answer:** There are 495 ways to choose 4 books to read from a bookshelf of 12 books. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\nWe need to find the number of ways to choose 4 books out of 12, without caring about the order in which we pick them. This is a classic combination problem.\n**2. Formula for Combinations**\nThe number of ways to choose *r* items from a set of *n* items (where order doesn't matter) is given by the combination formula:\n   nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)\nWhere:\n* nCr represents the number of combinations\n* n! (n factorial) means n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 2 * 1\n**3. Applying the Formula**\nIn our case:\n* n = 12 (total number of books)\n* r = 4 (number of books to choose)\nSo, the number of ways to choose 4 books from 12 is:\n12C4 = 12! / (4! * (12-4)!)\n     = 12! / (4! * 8!)\n     = (12 * 11 * 10 * 9) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1)\n     = 495\n**Answer:** There are 495 different ways to choose 4 books from a shelf of 12 books. \n",
