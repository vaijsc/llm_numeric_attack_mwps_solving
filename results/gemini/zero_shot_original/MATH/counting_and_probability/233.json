    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Solution 1: We choose any seat for Pierre, and then seat everyone else relative to Pierre.  There are 2 choices for Thomas; to the right or left of Pierre.  Then, there are 4 possible seats for Rosa that aren't adjacent to Pierre or Thomas. The five remaining people can be arranged in any of $5!$ ways, so there are a total of $2\\cdot 4\\cdot 5!=960$ valid ways to arrange the people around the table.\n\nSolution 2: The total number of ways in which Pierre and Thomas sit together is $6! \\cdot 2 = 1440$. The number of ways in which Pierre and Thomas sit together and Rosa sits next to one of them is $5! \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 480$. So the answer is the difference $1440 - 480 = \\boxed{960}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Treat Pierre and Thomas as a Unit**\nSince Pierre and Thomas must sit together, consider them as a single unit. Now we have 7 entities to arrange: \n* The Pierre-Thomas unit\n* 5 other people\n* Rosa\n**2.  Consider Rosa's Restriction**\nRosa cannot sit next to the Pierre-Thomas unit. This means she has to sit in one of the 5 spaces between the other people.\n**3. Arrange the Remaining People**\n* **Rosa's Position:** There are 5 ways to place Rosa.\n* **Pierre-Thomas Unit:**  The Pierre-Thomas unit can be arranged in 2 ways (Pierre on the left, Thomas on the right, or vice versa).\n* **Remaining People:** The remaining 5 people can be arranged in 5! (5 factorial) ways.\n**4.  Calculate Total Arrangements**\nThe total number of ways to arrange these people, considering all restrictions, is:\n5 (Rosa's positions) * 2 (Pierre-Thomas arrangements) * 5! (arrangements of the remaining people) = 5 * 2 * 120 = **1200**\n**Therefore, there are 1200 ways to arrange the 8 people around the table with the given restrictions.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Treat Pierre and Thomas as a unit:**\nSince Pierre and Thomas must sit together, consider them as a single unit.  Now we have 7 \"people\" to arrange: 6 individuals plus the Pierre/Thomas unit.\n**2. Arrange the unit and the others:**\n* There are 6! = 720 ways to arrange these 7 \"people\" around the circular table (remembering that rotations are not distinct).\n**3. Account for Pierre and Thomas's order:**\nWithin the Pierre/Thomas unit, they can swap positions.  This doubles our previous count. So, there are 720 * 2 = 1440 arrangements where Pierre and Thomas sit together.\n**4.  Consider Rosa's restriction:**\n* **Case 1: Rosa sits across from the Pierre/Thomas unit:** There are 4 remaining spots for Rosa.  After placing Rosa, there are 5! = 120 ways to arrange the remaining people.\n* **Case 2: Rosa sits two seats away from the Pierre/Thomas unit:** There are 2 possible positions for Rosa on each side of the Pierre/Thomas unit, giving us 4 total positions. After placing Rosa, there are 5! = 120 ways to arrange the remaining people.\n**5. Calculate the total valid arrangements:**\n* Total valid arrangements: 1440 - (4 * 120) - (4 * 120) = 1440 - 960 = 480\n**Therefore, there are 480 ways to seat the 8 people around the table, satisfying the given conditions.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Treat Pierre and Thomas as a Unit**\nSince Pierre and Thomas want to sit together, consider them as a single unit. Now we have 7 units to arrange:  Pierre/Thomas and 6 other people.\n**2. Arrange the Units**\nThese 7 units can be arranged around a circular table in (7-1)! = 6! ways.  Remember that in circular arrangements, we fix one person's position and arrange the rest, so we subtract 1 from the total number of people.\n**3. Arrange Pierre and Thomas**\nWithin the unit of Pierre and Thomas, they can swap positions in 2! ways.\n**4. Account for Rosa's Restriction**\n* **Rosa cannot sit next to either Pierre or Thomas.**  This means Rosa must be seated at least one seat away from the Pierre/Thomas unit.\n* **Consider the remaining seats:**  If we place the Pierre/Thomas unit, there are 5 seats remaining for Rosa. In these 5 seats, there are 3 places where Rosa can sit without being next to the unit (the two seats on either end and the seat directly across from the unit).\n**5. Calculate the Final Count**\nTo get the total number of arrangements satisfying all conditions, multiply the possibilities at each step:\n* **Arrangements of units:** 6!\n* **Arrangements within the Pierre/Thomas unit:** 2!\n* **Rosa's valid seating positions:** 3\nTherefore, the total number of arrangements is 6! * 2! * 3 = **4,320** ways. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step by step:\n**1. Treat Pierre and Thomas as one unit:**\nSince Pierre and Thomas want to sit together, consider them as a single unit. Now we have 7 units to arrange: the Pierre-Thomas unit and the other 6 people.\n**2. Arrange the 7 units:**\nThese 7 units can be arranged in a circle in (7-1)! = 6! = 720 ways. \n**3. Account for Pierre and Thomas's positions:**\nWithin the Pierre-Thomas unit, they can switch places, so we need to multiply by 2.\n**4.  Rosa's restriction:**\nNow, let's consider Rosa. We need to make sure she doesn't sit next to either Pierre or Thomas.  Think of the arrangement as a circle with the Pierre-Thomas unit in one spot.\n* **Place Rosa:** There are 5 spots left for Rosa (she can't be next to the unit).\n* **Place the rest:** The remaining 5 people can be arranged in the remaining spots in 5! ways.\n**5. Putting it all together:**\nThe total number of arrangements is: \n720 (arrangements of 7 units) * 2 (arrangements within Pierre-Thomas) * 5 (places for Rosa) * 5! (arrangements of remaining people) = **1,440,000**\n**Therefore, there are 1,440,000 ways to arrange the 8 people around the table with the given restrictions.** \n",
