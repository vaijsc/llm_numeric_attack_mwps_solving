    "solution": "Let's consider an `outcome' to be a choice of 2 numbers without regard to order.  There are $\\binom{9}{2} = 36$ ways to choose 2 numbers from our set of 9 if we don't care about order.  There are $\\binom{5}{2} = 10$ ways to choose 2 numbers from the 5 odd numbers without regard to order.  Therefore, the probability is $\\frac{10}{36} = \\boxed{\\frac{5}{18}}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this step-by-step:\n**1. Find the total number of possibilities:**\n* You're choosing 2 numbers from 9, so the total number of combinations is 9 choose 2, which is 9!/(2!7!) = 36.\n**2. Find the number of favorable outcomes:**\n* There are 5 odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).\n* We need to choose 2 odd numbers, so there are 5 choose 2 combinations, which is 5!/(2!3!) = 10.\n**3. Calculate the probability:**\n* Probability = (Favorable outcomes) / (Total possible outcomes) \n* Probability = 10 / 36 = 5/18\n**Therefore, the probability that both chosen integers are odd is 5/18.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this step-by-step:\n**1. Total Possibilities:**\n* We're choosing 2 numbers out of 9, so the total number of combinations is 9 choose 2 (written as  \u2079C\u2082 or \u2079C\u2082).  We can calculate this: \u2079C\u2082 = 9! / (2! * 7!) = 36.  There are 36 possible ways to choose two numbers from 1 to 9.\n**2. Favorable Outcomes:**\n* We want both numbers to be odd. There are 5 odd numbers between 1 and 9 (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).\n* The number of ways to choose 2 odd numbers out of 5 is \u2075C\u2082 = 5! / (2! * 3!) = 10.\n**3. Calculate the Probability**\n* Probability = (Favorable Outcomes) / (Total Possible Outcomes)\n* Probability = 10 / 36 = **5/18**\n**Therefore, the probability of choosing two distinct odd integers from 1 to 9 is 5/18.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the total number of possible outcomes:**\n* We have 9 integers to choose from.\n* For the first integer, we have 9 options.\n* For the second integer, we have 8 options left (since we can't choose the same number twice).\n* Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes is 9 * 8 = 72.\n**2. Find the number of favorable outcomes:**\n* There are 5 odd numbers between 1 and 9 (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).\n* For the first odd number, we have 5 options.\n* For the second odd number, we have 4 options left.\n* Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes is 5 * 4 = 20.\n**3. Calculate the probability:**\n* Probability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n* Probability = 20 / 72 \n* Probability = 5/18\n**Therefore, the probability of choosing two distinct odd integers from 1 to 9 is 5/18.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the total possible outcomes:**\n* We're choosing 2 numbers from 9.  The order we choose them in doesn't matter (choosing 3 then 5 is the same as choosing 5 then 3). This is a combination problem.\n* The total number of ways to choose 2 numbers from 9 is  \u2079C\u2082 = (9 * 8) / (2 * 1) = 36.\n**2. Find the number of favorable outcomes:**\n* There are 5 odd numbers between 1 and 9 (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).\n* We want to choose 2 of these odd numbers. \n* The number of ways to choose 2 odd numbers from 5 is \u2075C\u2082 = (5 * 4) / (2 * 1) = 10.\n**3. Calculate the probability:**\n* Probability = (Favorable Outcomes) / (Total Possible Outcomes)\n* Probability = 10 / 36 = 5/18\n**Therefore, the probability that the two chosen integers are both odd is 5/18.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Total Possible Outcomes**\n* We need to choose 2 integers out of 9.  The order we choose them in doesn't matter, so we'll use combinations.\n* The number of ways to choose 2 items from a set of 9 is given by the combination formula:  \u2079C\u2082 = 9! / (2! * 7!) = 36 \n**2.  Favorable Outcomes (Both Odd)**\n* There are 5 odd numbers between 1 and 9: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9.\n* We need to choose 2 of these.  The number of ways to do this is: \u2075C\u2082 = 5! / (2! * 3!) = 10\n**3. Calculate the Probability**\n* The probability of an event is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes.\n* Probability (both odd) = 10 / 36 = 5/18\n**Therefore, the probability that the two chosen integers are both odd is 5/18.** \n"
