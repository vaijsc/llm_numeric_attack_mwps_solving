    "problem": "Mary has $6$ identical basil plants, and three different window sills she can put them on. How many ways are there for Mary to put the plants on the window sills?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Since the plants are indistinguishable, we must only count the number of plants on each window sill.\n\nIf all the plants are on one window  sill, there are $3$ ways to choose which window sill they are on.\n\nIf $5$ plants are on one window sill and the last is on another, there are $3!=6$ ways to choose which plants go on which window sill.\n\nIf $4$ plants are on one window sill and the last two are on another, there are $3!=6$ ways to choose which window sill they are on.\n\nIf $4$ plants are on one window sill and the last two are each on one of the other windows, there are $3$ ways to choose which window the $4$ plants are on.\n\nIf $3$ plants are on one window and the other $3$ plants are all on another window, there are $3$ ways to choose which window has no plants.\n\nIf $3$ plants are on one window, $2$ plants on another window, and $1$ plant on the last window, there are $3!=6$ ways to choose which plants are on which windows.\n\nIf $2$ plants are on each window, there is only one way to arrange them.\n\nIn total, there are $3+6+6+3+3+6+1=\\boxed{28}$ ways to arrange the plants on the window sills.\n\nSee if you can find a faster way to do this problem by considering lining up the plants, and placing two dividers among the plants to separate them into three groups corresponding to the sills.",

        "Here's how we can solve this problem:\n* **Step 1:  Choose where to put the first plant.** Mary has 3 choices (the three window sills).\n* **Step 2: Choose where to put the second plant.**  Now she only has 3 choices again, because she can put it on the same sill as the first plant, or on one of the other two.\n* **Step 3: Choose where to put the third plant.**  Again, she has 3 choices.\n* **Step 4:  And so on...** This pattern continues until she places all 6 plants.\n**Calculation:**\nSince each plant has 3 choices, the total number of ways to arrange the plants is:\n3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 3\u2076 = **729**\n**Therefore, there are 729 different ways Mary can put the basil plants on the window sills.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n* **Step 1:  Consider the first window sill.** Mary has 6 choices of basil plants to put on the first sill.\n* **Step 2: Consider the second window sill.**  After placing a plant on the first sill, Mary has 5 plants left to choose from for the second sill.\n* **Step 3: Consider the third window sill.**  Now, Mary has 4 plants left to choose from for the third sill.\n* **Step 4: Calculate the total possibilities.** To find the total number of ways to arrange the plants, we multiply the number of choices at each step: 6 * 5 * 4 = 120\n**Therefore, there are 120 different ways Mary can put the basil plants on the window sills.** \n",
