    "solution": "We can find the probability they are all same color, then subtract that from 1. There are 26 cards of each color, so 3 of them can be selected in $\\binom{26}{3}$ ways, and of course there are 2 colors.

        "Here's how to break down the problem and find the solution:\n**1.  Understanding the Problem**\nWe want to find the probability of getting at least one card of a different color than the other two.  It's easier to calculate the probability of the event we *don't* want (all cards the same color) and subtract from 1.\n**2.  Calculating the Probability of All Cards the Same Color**\n* **Case 1: All Red** \n   * Probability of drawing a red card: 26/52 = 1/2\n   * Probability of drawing another red card (given the first was red): 25/51\n   * Probability of drawing a third red card (given the first two were red): 24/50 \n   * Total probability of all red: (1/2) * (25/51) * (24/50) = 12/102\n* **Case 2: All Black**\n   * The probability is the same as all red: 12/102\n**3.  Probability of All Cards the Same Color (Combined)**\n   * Add the probabilities of the two cases: 12/102 + 12/102 = 24/102\n**4.  Probability of Not All the Same Color**\n   * Subtract the probability of all the same color from 1: 1 - (24/102) = 78/102 = **13/17**\n**Therefore, the probability that the three cards are not all the same color is 13/17.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Probability of all cards being the same color**\n* **Case 1: All Red** -  The probability of drawing a red card is 26/52. Then, to get another red card, there are only 25 red cards left out of 51 total cards, and so on. \n   * Probability = (26/52) * (25/51) * (24/50) = 2/17\n* **Case 2: All Black** - The logic is the same as above, so the probability is also 2/17\n* **Total Probability of Same Color:**  The probability of getting either all red or all black is the sum of the individual probabilities: 2/17 + 2/17 = 4/17\n**2. Probability of not all the same color**\nSince the only two possibilities are all the same color or not all the same color, these probabilities must add up to 1.  \n* Probability of not all the same color = 1 - (Probability of all the same color)\n* Probability of not all the same color = 1 - (4/17) = **13/17**\n**Therefore, the probability of choosing three cards that are not all the same color is 13/17.** \n",
        "Here's how to break down the problem and find the probability:\n**1. Calculate the probability of all three cards being the same color.**\n* **Case 1: All Red** \n    * Probability of picking one red card: 26/52 = 1/2\n    * Probability of picking another red card (given the first was red): 25/51\n    * Probability of picking a third red card (given the first two were red): 24/50\n    * Total probability of all three red: (1/2) * (25/51) * (24/50) = 12/102 \n* **Case 2: All Black**\n    * The logic is the same as with red, so the probability is also 12/102\n* **Total Probability of Same Color:** 12/102 + 12/102 = 24/102 = 4/17\n**2. Calculate the probability of not all three cards being the same color.**\n* Since the events of having all the same color or not all the same color are complementary, the probability of not all the same color is 1 minus the probability of all the same color:\n   1 - (4/17) = **13/17**\n**Therefore, the probability of three randomly chosen cards not being all the same color is 13/17.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Probability of getting all the same color:**\n* **Case 1: All Red**\n   - Probability of getting a red card on the first draw: 26/52 = 1/2\n   - Probability of getting another red card after drawing a red card: 25/51\n   - Probability of getting a third red card after drawing two red cards: 24/50 \n   - Total probability of getting all red: (1/2) * (25/51) * (24/50) = 1/17\n* **Case 2: All Black**\n   - The probability of getting all black cards is the same as getting all red cards: 1/17\n* **Probability of all the same color:** 1/17 + 1/17 = 2/17\n**2. Probability of not all the same color:**\n* The probability of an event happening plus the probability of it not happening always equals 1.\n* Therefore, the probability of the cards not being all the same color is: 1 - (2/17) = **15/17**\n**So, the probability that three randomly chosen cards from a standard deck are not all the same color is 15/17.** \n",
