    "solution": "If he earns a walk on exactly one of his next two plate appearances, then one of his at-bats must be a walk and the other must not. The walk and non-walk could come in either order, so the probability is $\\frac{2}{5} \\cdot \\frac{3}{5} + \\frac{3}{5} \\cdot \\frac{2}{5} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{6}{25} = \\boxed{\\frac{12}{25}}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n* **Possible Scenarios:** There are two ways Larry can get exactly one walk in two plate appearances:\n    * Walk, then no walk (W, NW)\n    * No walk, then walk (NW, W)\n* **Probability of each scenario:**\n    *  Probability of (W, NW) = (2/5) * (3/5) = 6/25 \n        * (2/5) is the probability of a walk, and (3/5) is the probability of not getting a walk.\n    * Probability of (NW, W) = (3/5) * (2/5) = 6/25\n* **Total Probability:** Since these scenarios are mutually exclusive (they can't both happen at the same time), we add their probabilities together: \n    * 6/25 + 6/25 = 12/25\n**Therefore, the probability that Larry will earn a walk exactly once in his next two plate appearances is 12/25.** \n",

        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Define the Possible Outcomes**\nThere are two ways Larry can get exactly one walk in two plate appearances:\n* **Walk, No Walk:**  He walks in the first appearance and doesn't walk in the second.\n* **No Walk, Walk:** He doesn't walk in the first appearance and walks in the second.\n**2. Calculate the Probability of Each Outcome**\n* **Walk, No Walk:** The probability of a walk is 2/5, and the probability of not walking is 1 - 2/5 = 3/5. So, the probability of this outcome is (2/5) * (3/5) = 6/25.\n* **No Walk, Walk:** This has the same probability as the previous outcome: (3/5) * (2/5) = 6/25.\n**3. Add the Probabilities**\nSince either of the two outcomes satisfies the condition, we add their probabilities: 6/25 + 6/25 = **12/25**\n**Therefore, the probability that Larry will earn a walk exactly once in his next two plate appearances is 12/25.** \n",
