        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Total Games Played:**\n* In a tournament where everyone plays each other once, the total number of games is calculated using the formula:  n * (n - 1) / 2, where 'n' is the number of players.\n* In this case, n = 6, so there were 6 * (6 - 1) / 2 = 15 games played.\n**2. Games Won by Known Players:**\n* Helen: 4 games\n* Ines: 3 games\n* Janet: 2 games\n* Kendra: 2 games\n* Lara: 2 games\n* **Total games won by known players:** 4 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 13 games\n**3. Games Won by Monica:**\n* Since all 15 games were played, and we know the outcome of 13 games, Monica must have won the remaining games: 15 - 13 = 2 games.\n**Therefore, Monica won 2 games.** \n",
