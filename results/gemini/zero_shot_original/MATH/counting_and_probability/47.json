    "solution": "First we count the arrangements if the two N's are unique, which is 4!. Then since the N's are not unique, we divide by $2!$ for the arrangements of the N's, for an answer of $\\dfrac{4!}{2!} = \\boxed{12}$.",

        "Here's how to determine the number of ways to arrange the letters of the word \"NINE\":\n**1.  Count the letters:** The word \"NINE\" has four letters.\n**2.  Consider repetitions:** There are no repeated letters in \"NINE\".\n**3.  Apply the factorial:**  Since we have four distinct letters, the number of arrangements is 4! (4 factorial).\n**4.  Calculate the factorial:** 4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24\n**Therefore, there are 24 different ways to arrange the letters of the word \"NINE\".** \n",
        "Here's how to determine the number of ways to arrange the letters of the word NINE:\n**1. Count the Letters:**\n* The word \"NINE\" has 4 letters.\n**2. Consider Repetition:**\n* There are no repeated letters in \"NINE\".\n**3. Apply the Factorial Formula:**\n* When all letters are distinct, the number of ways to arrange *n* letters is *n*! (n factorial). \n* In this case, 4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24\n**Therefore, there are 24 ways to arrange the letters of the word NINE.** \n",
        "Here's how to determine the number of ways to arrange the letters of the word \"NINE\":\n**1. Count the Letters:**\n* The word \"NINE\" has 4 letters.\n**2. Factorial:**\n* If all the letters were unique, we'd have 4! (4 factorial) ways to arrange them. \n* 4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24\n**3. Consider Repetition:**\n* However, the letter \"N\" repeats twice. This means we've overcounted our arrangements.\n**4. Adjust for Repetition:**\n* To correct for the repeated \"N\", we need to divide our initial count (24) by the factorial of the number of times the letter repeats (2!).\n* 2! = 2 * 1 = 2\n**5. Final Calculation:**\n* The number of unique arrangements is 24 / 2 = 12.\n**Therefore, there are 12 ways to arrange the letters of the word \"NINE\".** \n",
