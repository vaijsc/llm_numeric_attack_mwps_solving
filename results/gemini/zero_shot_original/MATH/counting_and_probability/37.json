    "problem": "A street has 50 houses on each side, for a total of 100 houses. The addresses on the south side of the street form an arithmetic sequence, as do the addresses on the north side of the street.

    "solution": "If we combine the house numbers on the north and south sides, we get exactly the odd positive integers. The $100^{\\text{th}}$ odd integer is 199, so we divide the first 100 odd integers into three groups: \\[\\{1, 3,\\ldots, 9\\},\\qquad\\{11, 13, \\ldots, 99\\},\\qquad\\{101, 103, \\ldots, 199\\}\\] There are five numbers with one digit, 45 numbers with two digits, and 50 numbers with three digits. Thus, the total revenue is $1\\times5 + 2\\times 45 + 3\\times 50 = \\boxed{245}$.",

        "Here's how to break down the problem:\n**1. Find the pattern:**\n* **South side:** The difference between consecutive house numbers is 4 (1 + 4 = 5, 5 + 4 = 9, and so on).\n* **North side:** The difference between consecutive house numbers is also 4 (3 + 4 = 7, 7 + 4 = 11, and so on).\n**2. Determine the last house number on each side:**\n* **South side:** The last house number on the south side is 1 + (4 * 49) = 197 (since there are 50 houses on each side, the last house number is 50 terms into the arithmetic sequence).\n* **North side:** The last house number on the north side is 3 + (4 * 49) = 199.\n**3. Calculate the number of digits for each side:**\n* **South side:** \n    * House numbers 1-9 have 1 digit each (9 houses * 1 digit = 9 digits)\n    * House numbers 10-99 have 2 digits each (90 houses * 2 digits = 180 digits)\n    * House numbers 100-197 have 3 digits each (98 houses * 3 digits = 294 digits) \n    * Total digits on the south side: 9 + 180 + 294 = 483 digits\n* **North side:**  The same logic applies as the south side. The north side also has 483 digits.\n**4. Calculate the total number of digits:**\n* Total digits: 483 digits (south side) + 483 digits (north side) = 966 digits\n**5. Calculate the painter's earnings:**\n* Earnings: 966 digits * $1/digit = $966\n**Therefore, the sign painter earns $966.** \n",
        "Here's how we can break down the problem to find the painter's earnings:\n**1. South Side:**\n* **Common difference:** The addresses on the south side increase by 4 (5 - 1 = 4).\n* **Last address:** To find the last address, we can use the arithmetic sequence formula:  last term = first term + (number of terms - 1) * common difference.\n   * Last address = 1 + (50 - 1) * 4 = 197\n* **Number of digits:**  We need to figure out how many digits are used in total for the south side addresses.\n    * Addresses 1-9 use 9 digits (one digit each).\n    * Addresses 10-99 use 90 digits (two digits each).\n    * Addresses 100-197 use 98 digits (three digits each).\n    * Total digits on the south side: 9 + 180 + 294 = 483 digits\n**2. North Side:**\n* **Common difference:** The addresses on the north side increase by 4 (7 - 3 = 4).\n* **Last address:**  Using the same formula as above:\n    * Last address = 3 + (50 - 1) * 4 = 199\n* **Number of digits:** \n    * Addresses 3-9 use 7 digits.\n    * Addresses 10-99 use 90 digits.\n    * Addresses 100-199 use 100 digits.\n    * Total digits on the north side: 7 + 180 + 300 = 487 digits\n**3. Total Earnings:**\n* **Total digits for all houses:** 483 (south side) + 487 (north side) = 970 digits\n* **Painter's earnings:** 970 digits * $1/digit = $970\n**Therefore, the sign painter earns $970 for painting all the house numbers.** \n",
