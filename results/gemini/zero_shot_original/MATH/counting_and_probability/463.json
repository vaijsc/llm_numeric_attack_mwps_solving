Similarly, everything in Circle $A$ is either in circle $A$, but not in circle $B$; or in both circle $A$ and circle $B$. Additionally, everything in circle $C$ is in circle $B$ and everything in circle $B$ is in circle $A$. We are told that there are exactly 20 items in $A$ and 10 of those items are in $A$, but not in $B$. This means that there is a total of $$20-10=10$$ items in circle $B$. we are also told that there are 7 items in circle $C$. Because everything in circle $C$ is in circle $B$, we get that there are $$10-7=\\boxed{3}$$ items in circle $B$ but not in circle $C$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Items in A but not in B:**\n* We know there are 20 items in A and 10 of those are not in B. This means 20 - 10 = 10 items are in both A and B.\n**2. Items in B:**\n* We don't know the total number of items in B, but we know 10 items are in both A and B. \n**3. Items in C but not in B:**\n* We know there are 7 items in C.  Since we're looking for items in B *but not* in C, we don't need to consider the items in C.\n**4. Finding the Items in B but not in C:**\n*  We want to find the number of items in B that are *not* in C.  We know:\n    * 10 items are in both A and B (and possibly C).\n    * 7 items are in C (and possibly A and B).\n* To find the items in B but not in C, we need to consider the possibility of overlap between B and C.  \n**Unfortunately, we don't have enough information to find the exact number of items in B but not in C.** We need more information about how many of the items in C are also in B. \n",
