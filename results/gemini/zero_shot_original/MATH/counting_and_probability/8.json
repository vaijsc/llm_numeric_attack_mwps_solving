There are only two orders which satisfy the conditions of the problem, namely $(1, 2, 3, 6)$ and $(1, 3, 2, 6)$.  We now insert the 4 into the lineup, keeping in mind that it must appear to the right of the 1 and 2.  There are three possible positions in the first case and two spots in the second case, bringing the total number of orderings to five.  Finally, when placing the 5 into any one of these orderings we need only ensure that it appears to the right of the 1, so there are five possibilities for each of our five orderings, making $\\boxed{25}$ orderings in all.",

        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**Understanding the Condition**\nThe key to this problem is understanding the \"divisor\" condition. It means that if a number appears in the row, all its proper divisors (divisors other than the number itself) must appear before it in the row.\n**Starting with the Largest Number**\n* The largest number, 6, has divisors 1, 2, and 3.  Therefore, 6 must appear at the very end of the row.\n* The next largest number is 5, which has only 1 as a divisor. Since 1 must appear before 5, 5 must be the second to last number in the row.\n**Working Backwards**\nNow let's consider the remaining numbers:\n* **4:**  Its divisors are 1 and 2. Both 1 and 2 must appear before 4. \n* **3:** Its only divisor is 1, which has already been placed.\n* **2:** Its only divisor is 1, which has already been placed.\n* **1:** This has no proper divisors, so it can be placed anywhere.\n**Possible Arrangements**\nLet's analyze the possible arrangements for the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4, keeping in mind that they need to appear before 5 and 6:\n1. **1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6:**  This arrangement satisfies all conditions.\n2. **1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6:**  This also satisfies all conditions.\n**Conclusion**\nThere are **two** possible ways to write the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 in a row so that all the divisors of each number appear to its left:\n* **1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6**\n* **1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step by step:\n**Understanding the Condition**\nThe condition means that if a number appears in the row, all its proper divisors (divisors excluding the number itself) must appear to its left. For example, if 6 appears in the row, then both 1, 2, and 3 must appear before it.\n**Starting with the Smallest Numbers**\n* **1:**  The number 1 has no proper divisors, so it can be placed anywhere.\n* **2:** The only proper divisor of 2 is 1. So, 1 must be placed to the left of 2.\n**Building the Sequence**\n* **3:** The proper divisor of 3 is 1. Since 1 is already placed, we can place 3 anywhere to the right of 1 and 2.\n* **4:** The proper divisors of 4 are 1 and 2. Since both are already placed, we can place 4 to the right of 2 and 3.\n* **5:** The only proper divisor of 5 is 1, and it's already placed.  We can place 5 to the right of 4.\n* **6:** The proper divisors of 6 are 1, 2, and 3. They are all already placed. We can place 6 to the right of 5.\n**The Solution**\nTherefore, there is only **one** way to arrange the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 in a row satisfying the given condition:\n**1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6** \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**Understanding the Condition**\nThe condition states that for each number in the row, all its proper divisors (divisors excluding the number itself) must appear to its left.  This means we need to arrange the numbers in a way that respects their divisibility relationships.\n**Finding the Starting Point**\n* The number 1 has no proper divisors, so it can be placed anywhere. Let's start by placing it at the beginning:  **1** \n* The number 2 only has 1 as a divisor, and 1 is already placed. So, 2 can be placed next: **1 2**\n**Building the Chain**\n* Now consider the number 3. Its only proper divisor is 1, which is already placed. So, we can place 3 next: **1 2 3**\n* The number 4 has divisors 1 and 2, both of which are already placed. We place 4 next: **1 2 3 4** \n* The number 5 only has 1 as a divisor, which is already placed. We place 5 next: **1 2 3 4 5**\n* Finally, the number 6 has divisors 1, 2, and 3, all already placed. We place 6 last: **1 2 3 4 5 6**\n**The Only Solution**\nNotice that the order we established (1 2 3 4 5 6) is the only way to satisfy the condition.  We can't rearrange the numbers without violating the divisibility rule.\n**Answer:**\nTherefore, there is only **one** way to write the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 in a row so that all of their proper divisors appear to their left. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**Understanding the Constraint**\nThe rule states that for any number in the row, all of its proper divisors (divisors excluding the number itself) must appear to its left.  This means we need to arrange the numbers in a way that respects the divisibility relationships.\n**Starting with the Largest Number**\n* **6:**  The number 6 has the divisors 1, 2, and 3. Since all of these must appear to the left of 6, 6 must be the last number in the row.\n**Working Backwards**\n* **5:** The number 5 is prime, so it has only one divisor (1). This means 5 must come immediately before 6.\n* **4:** The number 4 has divisors 1 and 2. Since 1 is already placed, 2 must come before 4.\n* **3:** The number 3 is prime, so it must come before 4.\n* **2:** The number 2 has only 1 as a divisor, and 1 is already placed.\n* **1:** The number 1 has no proper divisors, so it can go at the very beginning.\n**The Only Solution**\nFollowing this logic, the only way to arrange the numbers is:\n**1 2 3 4 5 6**\n**Therefore, there is only one way to write the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 in a row so that all divisors appear to the left of the number.** \n",
