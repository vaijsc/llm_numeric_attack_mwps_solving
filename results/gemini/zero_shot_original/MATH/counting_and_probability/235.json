    "solution": "Since 10 is small for a product, we consider the complementary probability, that their product is at most 10. To do this, we count the number of ordered pairs of positive integers $(m,n)$ with $mn\\le10$ ($m$ is Krishanu's number and $n$ is Shaunak's number). If $m=1$, there are 10 such pairs; if $m=2$, there are 5; if $m=3$ there are 3; if $m=4$ or $m=5$, there are 2, and if $m=6,7,8,9,10$ there is 1, for a total of $$10+5+3+2+2+1+1+1+1+1=27$$ordered pairs with product at most 10. The probability one of these is picked is then $27/100$, since there are $10\\cdot10=100$ possible ordered pairs. Therefore, the probability that the product of their numbers is greater than 10 is $1-27/100=\\boxed{\\frac{73}{100}}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Count the Total Possibilities**\n* Krishanu has 10 choices (1 through 10).\n* Shaunak also has 10 choices.\n*  The total number of possible pairs they can choose is 10 * 10 = 100.\n**2.  Count the Possibilities Where the Product is Less Than or Equal to 10**\n* To make the product less than or equal to 10, we need to find all the pairs where the product is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10.\n* These pairs are: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (1, 10), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 1), (5, 2), (6, 1), (7, 1), (8, 1), (9, 1), (10, 1). That's a total of 27 pairs.\n**3.  Find the Probability of the Product Being Greater Than 10**\n* The probability of the product being greater than 10 is the number of favorable outcomes (product greater than 10) divided by the total number of possible outcomes. \n* Number of favorable outcomes = Total outcomes -  Unfavorable outcomes = 100 - 27 = 73.\n* Probability = 73 / 100\n**Answer:** The probability that the product of their numbers is more than 10 is **73/100**. \n",
