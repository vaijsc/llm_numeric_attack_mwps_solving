    "solution": "There are 5 ways to choose a Republican, 6 ways to choose a Democrat, and 2 ways to choose an Independent for a total of $5 \\times 6 \\times 2 = 60$ different subcommittees of a Republican, Democrat, and Independent.   There are $\\binom{13}{3} = \\dfrac{13\\cdot12\\cdot 11}{3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1} = 286$ ways to choose 3 people from 13 to form a committee, so there are 286 possible committees. Therefore, the probability that the subcommittee is made up of a Republican, Democrat, and Independent is $\\dfrac{60}{286} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{30}{143}}$ .",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the total number of possible subcommittees:**\n* We need to choose 3 members out of 13.  This is a combination problem.\n* The total number of ways to do this is \u2081\u2083C\u2083 = (13 * 12 * 11) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 286\n**2. Find the number of subcommittees with 1 Republican, 1 Democrat, and 1 Independent:**\n* We need to choose 1 Republican out of 5: \u2085C\u2081 = 5\n* We need to choose 1 Democrat out of 6: \u2086C\u2081 = 6\n* We need to choose 1 Independent out of 2: \u2082C\u2081 = 2\n**3. Calculate the probability:**\n* The probability of getting a subcommittee with 1 Republican, 1 Democrat, and 1 Independent is:\n   (Number of favorable subcommittees) / (Total number of subcommittees)\n   = (5 * 6 * 2) / 286\n   = 60 / 286\n   = **30/143**\n**Therefore, the probability that the subcommittee consists of 1 Republican, 1 Democrat, and 1 Independent is 30/143.** \n",

Find the total number of possible subcommittees.**\n* There are 13 senators in total.\n* We need to choose 3 of them.  \n* This is a combination problem, and we can use the formula:  \u00b9\u00b3C\u2083 = (13!)/(3!10!) = 286 \n* There are 286 possible subcommittees.\n**2.
