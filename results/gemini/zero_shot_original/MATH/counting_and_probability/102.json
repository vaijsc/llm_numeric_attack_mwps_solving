For $1\\times3$ rectangles, the upper left unit square of the rectangle must be in one of the leftmost four columns and can be in any row, giving 24 possible locations. Similarly, there are 24 possible locations for a $3\\times1$ rectangle. Therefore, the total number of rectangles of area 3 which can be formed is $\\boxed{48}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding the Problem**\nWe need to find all the possible rectangles within the grid that have an area of 3 square units.  Since the grid is made of unit squares, a rectangle with an area of 3 can be formed by either:\n* **1 x 3 rectangle:** One square wide and three squares long.\n* **3 x 1 rectangle:** Three squares wide and one square long.\n**Counting the Rectangles**\n* **1 x 3 rectangles:** \n    *  We can start with the top row and move down. There are 4 possible 1 x 3 rectangles in each row. \n    *  Since there are 5 rows, there are a total of 4 * 5 = 20 possible 1 x 3 rectangles.\n* **3 x 1 rectangles:**\n    *  We can start with the leftmost column and move right.  There are 3 possible 3 x 1 rectangles in each column. \n    *  Since there are 4 columns, there are a total of 3 * 4 = 12 possible 3 x 1 rectangles.\n**Total Rectangles**\nIn total, there are 20 + 12 = **32** rectangles of area 3 square units that can be formed within the grid. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Understand the Requirements**\n* We need to find rectangles with an area of 3 square units.\n* The rectangles must be formed using the grid lines as their sides.\n**2. Analyze the Possible Dimensions**\n* The only way to get an area of 3 is with a rectangle that has dimensions of 1 unit by 3 units.\n**3. Count the Possibilities**\n* **Horizontal rectangles:**  Think of each row.  You can place a 1 by 3 rectangle in 4 different positions within each row (starting at the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th square). Since there are 6 rows, this gives us 4 positions/row * 6 rows = 24 horizontal rectangles.\n* **Vertical rectangles:**  Similarly, you can place a 1 by 3 rectangle vertically within each column (4 positions per column). There are 6 columns, so this gives us 4 positions/column * 6 columns = 24 vertical rectangles.\n**4. Total Count**\n* In total, there are 24 horizontal rectangles + 24 vertical rectangles = **48 rectangles** with an area of 3 square units. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Understand the Requirements**\n* We need to find rectangles with an area of 3 square units. \n* The sides of the rectangles must align with the grid lines.\n**2.  Possible Dimensions**\nThe only way to get an area of 3 square units is to have a rectangle with dimensions of 1 unit by 3 units (or 3 units by 1 unit, but that's just a rotation of the same rectangle).\n**3.  Counting the Rectangles**\n* **1 by 3 rectangles:**\n    * **Horizontally:**  There are 5 horizontal lines where you can place the 1-unit side of the rectangle. For each of these positions, there are 4 possible positions for the 3-unit side. This gives us 5 * 4 = 20 rectangles.\n    * **Vertically:** The same logic applies, so there are also 20 rectangles with the 3-unit side vertical.\n**4. Total Rectangles**\nTherefore, there are a total of 20 + 20 = **40** rectangles with an area of 3 square units. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Understand the Requirements**\nWe need to find rectangles with an area of 3 square units.  This means the rectangles must have dimensions of 1 unit by 3 units or 3 units by 1 unit.\n**2. Count the Possibilities**\n* **1 unit by 3 units:** \n    * There are 5 horizontal lines of length 3 units.  For each of these lines, there are 4 possible vertical lines that could form the sides of a 1 by 3 rectangle. This gives us 5 * 4 = 20 possibilities.\n* **3 units by 1 units:**\n    * There are 5 vertical lines of length 3 units. For each of these lines, there are 4 possible horizontal lines that could form the sides of a 3 by 1 rectangle. This also gives us 5 * 4 = 20 possibilities.\n**3. Total Rectangles**\nAdding the two cases together, we get a total of 20 + 20 = **40** rectangles with an area of 3 square units. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1.  Understanding the Problem**\nWe need to find all possible rectangles within the 6x6 grid that have an area of 3 square units.  Since the area of a rectangle is length times width, we need to find combinations of length and width that multiply to 3.\n**2.  Possible Dimensions**\nThe only way to get an area of 3 is with a length of 3 and a width of 1.\n**3.  Counting the Rectangles**\n* **Length 3, Width 1:** Imagine sliding a 1x3 rectangle horizontally across the grid.  \n    * You can fit 3 such rectangles in each row.\n    * Since there are 6 rows, there are 3 * 6 = 18 rectangles with this orientation.\n**4.  Total Rectangles**\nWe've only considered rectangles with length 3 and width 1. We can also have rectangles with length 1 and width 3.  Since the grid is symmetrical, there will also be 18 rectangles with this orientation.\n**5.  Final Answer**\nIn total, there are 18 + 18 = **36** rectangles with an area of 3 square units that can be formed within the 6x6 grid. \n"
