        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n* **Units digit:** The smallest prime number is 2. So, the units digit must be 2.\n* **Hundreds digit:** The hundreds digit must be greater than 5. This means it can be 6, 7, 8, or 9.\n* **Tens digit:** The tens digit must be greater than 4 but less than 8. This means it can be 5, 6, or 7.\nNow, to find the total number of possibilities, we need to multiply the number of choices for each digit:\n* Hundreds digit: 4 choices\n* Tens digit: 3 choices\n* Units digit: 1 choice\nTherefore, there are 4 * 3 * 1 = **12** three-digit numbers that satisfy all the conditions. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n* **Units Digit:** The smallest prime number is 2.  So, the units digit is fixed at 2.\n* **Hundreds Digit:** The hundreds digit must be greater than 5. This means it can be 6, 7, 8, or 9.\n* **Tens Digit:** The tens digit must be greater than 4 but less than 8. This means it can be 5, 6, or 7.\nNow, let's figure out how many combinations we can make:\n* **Hundreds Digit Choices:** 4 options (6, 7, 8, 9)\n* **Tens Digit Choices:** 3 options (5, 6, 7)\nTo find the total number of combinations, we multiply the number of choices for each digit:\n4 choices * 3 choices = **12**\nTherefore, there are **12** three-digit numbers that satisfy all the given conditions. \n",
