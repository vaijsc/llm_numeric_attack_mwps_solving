        "Here's how to solve this step by step:\n**1. Identify the prime numbers:**\nThe prime numbers in the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11} are: {2, 3, 5, 7, 11}\n**2. Count the prime numbers:**\nThere are 5 prime numbers in the set.\n**3. Count the non-empty subsets:**\n* A set with *n* elements has 2<sup>*n*</sup> subsets in total (including the empty set). \n* To find the non-empty subsets, we subtract 1 for the empty set.\n* Therefore, the number of non-empty subsets of {2, 3, 5, 7, 11} is 2<sup>5</sup> - 1 = 32 - 1 = **31**.\n**Answer:** There are **31** non-empty subsets of {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11} that consist entirely of prime numbers. \n",

Count the Prime Numbers:**\nWe have a total of 5 prime numbers.\n**3. Determine the Number of Subsets:**\nEach prime number can either be included or excluded from a subset. Since we have 5 prime numbers, we have 2 choices (include or exclude) for each. \n*  For the first prime, we have 2 options (include or exclude).\n*  For the second prime, we also have 2 options.\n*  And so on...\nTherefore, the total number of possible subsets is 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 2^5 = 32\n**4. Account for the Empty Set:**\nThe count of 32 includes the empty set (the subset with no elements). Since we want only non-empty subsets, we subtract 1.\n**Answer:** There are **31** non-empty subsets of {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11} consisting entirely of prime numbers. \n",

Count the Prime Numbers:**\nThere are 5 prime numbers in the set.\n**3.  Form Subsets:**\nTo find the number of non-empty subsets, we use the concept of combinations.  Each subset is formed by choosing some of the prime numbers, and the order doesn't matter. \n* We can choose 1 prime number in 5 ways.\n* We can choose 2 prime numbers in  \u2075C\u2082 = 10 ways.\n* We can choose 3 prime numbers in \u2075C\u2083 = 10 ways.\n* We can choose 4 prime numbers in \u2075C\u2084 = 5 ways.\n* We can choose 5 prime numbers in \u2075C\u2085 = 1 way.\n**4.

Count the prime numbers:**\nThere are 5 prime numbers in the set.\n**3.  Consider the possibilities for subsets:**\nTo form a subset consisting only of prime numbers, we can choose any combination of the 5 prime numbers.\n**4.  Apply the power set concept:**\nThe number of subsets of a set with *n* elements is 2^n.  This is because each element has two options: be in the subset or not be in the subset.\n**5.  Calculate the number of subsets:**\nSince we have 5 prime numbers, the number of subsets consisting only of prime numbers is 2^5 = **32**.\n**6.  Account for the empty set:**\nWe need to subtract 1 from this count because the empty set is not a non-empty subset.\n**7.

There are 5C2 = 10 ways to do this (using combinations).\n* **Three-Element Subsets:** We can choose 3 prime numbers out of 5. There are 5C3 = 10 ways to do this. \n* **Four-Element Subsets:** We can choose 4 prime numbers out of 5. There are 5C4 = 5 ways to do this.\n* **Five-Element Subset:** There is only 1 way to choose all 5 prime numbers.\n**4.
