    "solution": "Since $\\frac{2005}{3} = 668\\frac13$, there are 668 multiples of 3 between 1 and 2005.  Since $\\frac{2005}{4} = 501\\frac14$, there are 501 multiples of 4 between 1 and 2005.  Since $\\frac{2005}{12} = 167\\frac{1}{12}$, there are 167 multiples of 12 between 1 and 2005.\n\nEvery multiple of 12 is also a multiple of 3 and of 4, so there are $668-167 = 501$ multiples of 3 that are not multiples of 12 and $501-167 = 334$ multiples of 4 that are not multiples of 12.  That leaves $501 + 334 = \\boxed{835}$ numbers that are multiples of 3 or 4 but not 12.  (Note: no number can be a multiple of 3 and 4 without also being a multiple of 12.  So, no number is included twice in our count $501+334$.)",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Multiples of 3:**\n* There are 2005 / 3 = 668 multiples of 3 between 1 and 2005.\n**2. Multiples of 4:**\n* There are 2005 / 4 = 501 multiples of 4 between 1 and 2005.\n**3. Multiples of 12:**\n* There are 2005 / 12 = 167 multiples of 12 between 1 and 2005.\n**4. Overlap:**\n* We've counted the multiples of 12 twice (once as multiples of 3 and once as multiples of 4).  Therefore, we need to subtract the number of multiples of 12 once.\n**5. Calculation:**\n* Total numbers divisible by 3 or 4 (but not both): 668 + 501 - 167 = 992\n**Therefore, there are 992 numbers between 1 and 2005 that are integer multiples of 3 or 4 but not 12.** \n",

Multiples of 12 (which are also multiples of 3 and 4):**\n* There are 2005 / 12 = 167 multiples of 12 between 1 and 2005.\n**4. Avoiding Double Counting:**\n* To get the number of multiples of 3 or 4, we need to add the number of multiples of 3 and the number of multiples of 4, and then subtract the number of multiples of 12 (because we've counted them twice).\n**5. Calculation:**\n* Total multiples of 3 or 4: 668 + 501 = 1169\n* Subtract multiples of 12: 1169 - 167 = 1002\n**Therefore, there are 1002 numbers between 1 and 2005 that are integer multiples of 3 or 4 but not 12.** \n",
