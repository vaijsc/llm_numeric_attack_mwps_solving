    "problem": "I have 7 books I want to arrange on a shelf. Two of them are math books, and one is a physics book. How many ways are there for me to arrange the books if I want to put the math books next to each other, and put both of them to the left of the physics book?

    "solution": "We can arrange the books on the shelf, pretending that the two math books are actually one book because they must be next to each other. In exactly half of these arrangements, the math books will be to the left of the physics book, giving $6!/2=360$ arrangements. However, in each of these arrangements there are two ways to arrange the math books, so the total number of arrangements is $360\\cdot2=\\boxed{720}$.",

        "Here's how we can solve this step-by-step:\n1. **Treat the math books as one unit:** Since the math books must be together, we can consider them as a single unit. This gives us 6 units to arrange (the math unit, the physics book, and the 4 other books).\n2. **Arrange the units:** These 6 units can be arranged in 6! (6 factorial) ways, which is 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720.\n3. **Arrange the math books within their unit:** The two math books can be arranged within their unit in 2! (2 factorial) ways, which is 2 * 1 = 2.\n4. **Position the physics book:**  The physics book must be to the right of the math unit.  Since we've already considered the order of the units, we don't need to make any further choices here.\n5. **Total arrangements:** To get the total number of arrangements, we multiply the number of ways to arrange the units by the number of ways to arrange the math books within their unit: 720 * 2 = 1440.\n**Therefore, there are 1440 ways to arrange the books with the math books together and to the left of the physics book.** \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this step-by-step:\n1. **Treat the math books as a unit:** Since the math books must stay together, imagine them as one big \"math book\" for now.  This gives us 6 items to arrange: 1 \"math book\", 1 physics book, and 4 other books.\n2. **Arrange the 6 items:** These 6 items can be arranged in 6! (6 factorial) ways, which is 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720.\n3. **Arrange the math books within their unit:**  The two math books can be arranged within their \"unit\" in 2! (2 factorial) ways, which is 2 * 1 = 2.\n4. **Combine the arrangements:** To get the total number of arrangements, we multiply the number of ways to arrange the 6 items by the number of ways to arrange the math books within their unit: 720 * 2 = 1440.\n**Therefore, there are 1440 ways to arrange the books with the math books together and to the left of the physics book.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n1. **Treat the math books as a unit:** Since the math books must be together, we can consider them as a single unit.

        "Here's how to solve this step-by-step:\n1. **Treat the math books as a single unit:** Since the math books must stay together, we can think of them as one combined unit.

        "Here's how to solve this step-by-step:\n1. **Treat the math books as one unit:** Since the math books must be together, imagine them as a single \"block\".  Now we have 6 units to arrange: the math block, the physics book, and the remaining 4 books.\n2. **Arrange the 6 units:** These 6 units can be arranged in 6!
