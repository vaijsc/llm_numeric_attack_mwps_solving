    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The prime numbers from 1 to 6 are 2, 3, and 5. Thus, the probability of Adam not rolling a prime number on any one die is equal to $\\frac{3}{6}=\\frac{1}{2}$, since there is an equal probability of rolling any number from 1 to 6. Since the two dice are independent, the probability of Adam not rolling a prime number on either die is equal to $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n* **Identify the prime numbers on a die:** The prime numbers on a standard six-sided die are 2, 3, and 5.\n* **Calculate the number of non-prime outcomes:**  There are three non-prime numbers (1, 4, and 6).\n* **Calculate the probability of not rolling a prime on one die:**  There are 3 non-prime outcomes and 6 total outcomes, so the probability of not rolling a prime on one die is 3/6 = 1/2.\n* **Calculate the probability of not rolling a prime on both dice:** Since the rolls are independent, we multiply the probability of not rolling a prime on the first die by the probability of not rolling a prime on the second die: (1/2) * (1/2) = **1/4**. \n",
