    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "We know a person can either play a string instrument or not play a string instrument. $60\\% \\times 130 = 78$ musicians play string instruments, yielding $130-78 = \\boxed{52}$ musicians who do not play string instruments.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the percentage of musicians who don't play string instruments:**\n* If 60% play string instruments, then 100% - 60% = 40% do not play string instruments.\n**2. Calculate the number of musicians who don't play string instruments:**\n* Multiply the total number of musicians by the percentage who don't play string instruments: 130 musicians * 40% = 52 musicians.\n**Answer:** There are **52** musicians in the orchestra who do not play string instruments. \n",
