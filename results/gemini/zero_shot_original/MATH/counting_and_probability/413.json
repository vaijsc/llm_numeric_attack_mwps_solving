    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The first thing to do is place the B since it has a restriction on it. We can put it anywhere but the first place, so we have 5 options. Once we have done that, we just need to place the two N's and then the rest of the spots will just be A's. We have 5 spots left, so there are 5 options for where to put the first N and 4 options for where to put the second N. However, the two N's are identical, which means that we've counted each new word twice. So our answer is $\\frac{5\\times5\\times4}{2}=\\boxed{50}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Total Rearrangements:**\n* We have 6 letters in the word BANANA. \n* There are 3 A's, 2 N's, and 1 B.\n* The total number of ways to rearrange these letters (without any restrictions) is: 6!/(3!2!1!) = 60\n**2. Rearrangements Starting with B:**\n* If the word starts with B, we have 5 remaining letters to arrange: AANAA.\n* The number of ways to rearrange these is: 5!/(3!2!) = 10\n**3. Rearrangements Not Starting with B:**\n* To find the number of arrangements that *don't* start with B, we subtract the arrangements that *do* start with B from the total number of arrangements: \n* 60 - 10 = 50\n**Therefore, there are 50 ways to rearrange the letters of the word BANANA such that the new word does not begin with a B.** \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem:\n**1. Total Arrangements:**\n* The word BANANA has 6 letters.\n* There are 3 A's, 2 N's, and 1 B.\n* To find the total possible arrangements, we use the formula for permutations with repetition: \n   * Total arrangements = 6! / (3! * 2! * 1!) = 60\n**2. Arrangements Starting with B:**\n* If the word starts with B, we have 5 remaining letters to arrange.\n* The remaining arrangements are 5! / (3! * 2!) = 10\n**3. Arrangements Not Starting with B:**\n* To find the arrangements that *don't* start with B, subtract the arrangements starting with B from the total arrangements:\n    * Arrangements not starting with B = 60 - 10 = 50\n**Therefore, there are 50 ways to rearrange the letters of the word BANANA so that the new word does not begin with a B.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Total Arrangements:**\n* First, consider all possible arrangements of the letters in \"BANANA\". \n* There are 6 letters, but 3 of them are 'A'.  So, the total number of arrangements is 6! / (3!) = 720 / 6 = 120.\n**2. Arrangements Starting with B:**\n* Now, let's count the arrangements that *do* start with 'B'.\n* If the first letter is 'B', we have 5 remaining positions to fill with the letters 'A', 'N', 'A', 'N', 'A'. This is similar to the previous step, but with 5 letters instead of 6.\n* The number of arrangements starting with 'B' is 5! / (3!) = 120 / 6 = 20.\n**3. Arrangements Not Starting with B:**\n* To find the number of arrangements *not* starting with 'B', subtract the arrangements that start with 'B' from the total number of arrangements.\n* Arrangements not starting with 'B' = Total arrangements - Arrangements starting with 'B' = 120 - 20 = 100.\n**Answer:** There are **100** ways to rearrange the letters of the word \"BANANA\" so that the new word does not begin with a 'B'. \n",
