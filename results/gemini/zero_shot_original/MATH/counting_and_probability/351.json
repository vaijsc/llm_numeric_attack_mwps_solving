        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n* **Understanding the Problem:**  The probability of an event happening and the probability of it not happening must always add up to 1 (or 100%).\n* **Setting up the Equation:** Let 'x' represent the probability of the dart *not* landing on the target.  We know:\n   Probability (dart landing on target) + Probability (dart not landing on target) = 1 \n   \n   This translates to:  (3/8) + x = 1\n* **Solving for x:**\n   1. Subtract (3/8) from both sides of the equation: x = 1 - (3/8)\n   2. Find a common denominator for 1 and 3/8: x = (8/8) - (3/8)\n   3. Subtract the numerators: x = 5/8\n* **Answer:** The probability that the dart will not land on the target is **5/8**. \n",

        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n* **Understanding Complementary Events:** The probability of an event happening and the probability of that event *not* happening always add up to 1 (or 100%). These are called complementary events.\n* **Applying the Concept:** \n   * We know the probability of the dart landing on the target is 3/8.\n   * The probability of the dart *not* landing on the target is the complement of this. \n* **Calculation:**\n   *  1 (representing the entire probability space) - 3/8 = 5/8\n**Answer:** The probability that the dart will not land on the target is **5/8**. \n",
