        "Here's how to solve this step-by-step:\n1. **Find the square roots:**\n   - The square root of 100 is 10.\n   - The square root of 300 is approximately 17.32.\n2. **Identify the prime numbers:** This means we need to find the prime numbers between 10 and 17.  Remember, a prime number is only divisible by 1 and itself.\n3. **List the primes:**  The prime numbers between 10 and 17 are:\n    - 11\n    - 13\n    - 17\n4. **Count:** There are **three** prime numbers whose squares fall between 100 and 300. \n",
