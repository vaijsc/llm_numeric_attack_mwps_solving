        "Here's how to calculate the expected value:\n**1. Define the outcomes and their probabilities:**\n* **Outcome 1:**  Heads (H) with probability 3/4 \n* **Outcome 2:** Tails (T) with probability 1/4\n**2. Define the values associated with each outcome:**\n* **Value of H:** +$2 (you win $2)\n* **Value of T:** -$1 (you lose $1)\n**3. Calculate the expected value:**\nThe expected value (EV) is calculated as the sum of the products of each outcome's value and its probability:\nEV = (Value of H * Probability of H) + (Value of T * Probability of T)\nEV = ($2 * 3/4) + (-$1 * 1/4)\nEV = $1.50 - $0.25\n**EV = $1.25**\nTherefore, the expected value of a coin flip is **$1.25**. This means that on average, you can expect to win $1.25 per coin flip. \n",
