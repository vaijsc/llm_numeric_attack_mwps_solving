    "solution": "We can make a triangle out of any three vertices, so the problem is really asking how many ways there are to choose three vertices from six. There are six choices for the first vertex, five for the second, and four for the third. However, we've overcounted, so we have to determine how many different orders there are in which we could choose those same three vertices. That is, if we choose $x$ for the first vertex, $y$ for the second, and $z$ for the third, it will be the same triangle as if we had chosen $y$ for the first vertex, $z$ for the second, and $x$ for the third. We can pick any three of the vertices first, any two second, and then the last is determined, so we've overcounted by a factor of six. Thus, our final answer is $\\frac{6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4}{6} = \\boxed{20}$ triangles.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Choosing the First Vertex**\n* We have 6 choices for the first vertex of our triangle.\n**2. Choosing the Second Vertex**\n* After choosing the first vertex, we have 5 choices left for the second vertex.\n**3. Choosing the Third Vertex**\n* We have 4 choices left for the third vertex.\n**4. The Problem with Overcounting**\n* Notice that we've overcounted our triangles!  For example, if we choose vertices 1, 2, and 3, that's the same triangle as choosing vertices 3, 2, and 1.  We've counted each triangle 3! (3*2*1 = 6) times because we could have chosen the vertices in any order.\n**5. Correcting for Overcounting**\n* To get the correct number of triangles, we need to divide the initial number of possibilities by 6: (6 * 5 * 4) / 6 = 20.\n**Answer:** There are **20** different triangles that can be formed using three vertices of a hexagon. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\nWe have a hexagon, and we want to find out how many different triangles we can form using its vertices.\n**2. Choosing Vertices**\n*  To form a triangle, we need to choose 3 vertices out of the 6.\n**3. Combinations**\nThis is a combination problem because the order in which we choose the vertices doesn't matter.  We can use the following formula:\n   * **nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)** \n   Where:\n     * n is the total number of items (vertices in our case)\n     * r is the number of items we choose at a time\n**4. Applying the Formula**\n*  n = 6 (vertices of the hexagon)\n*  r = 3 (vertices needed for a triangle)\n   So, the number of different triangles is: 6C3 = 6! / (3! * 3!) = (6 * 5 * 4) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 20\n**Answer:** You can form 20 different triangles using the vertices of a hexagon. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Choosing the First Vertex:**\n* You have 6 choices for the first vertex of the triangle.\n**2. Choosing the Second Vertex:**\n* After choosing the first vertex, you have 5 remaining vertices to choose from for the second vertex.\n**3. Choosing the Third Vertex:**\n* Now, you have 4 remaining vertices to choose from for the third vertex.\n**4. Avoiding Overcounting:**\n* It seems like we have 6 * 5 * 4 = 120 ways to choose the vertices. However, this overcounts the triangles because the order we choose the vertices doesn't matter (triangle ABC is the same as triangle CAB). \n**5. Correcting for Overcounting:**\n* Since each triangle has 3! = 6 different ways to be ordered, we need to divide our initial count by 6. \n**Therefore, the total number of different triangles is (6 * 5 * 4) / 6 = 20.** \n",
