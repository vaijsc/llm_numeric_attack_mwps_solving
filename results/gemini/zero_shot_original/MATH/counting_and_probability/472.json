        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the smallest and largest multiples of 11 within the three-digit range:**\n* The smallest three-digit multiple of 11 is 110 (11 x 10).\n* The largest three-digit multiple of 11 is 990 (11 x 90).\n**2. Determine the number of multiples:**\n* We need to find how many multiples of 11 exist between 110 and 990 inclusive.\n* This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term is 110, the common difference is 11, and the last term is 990.\n**3. Use the formula for arithmetic sequences:**\n* The formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is:  a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\n    * a_n = the nth term (990)\n    * a_1 = the first term (110)\n    * d = the common difference (11)\n    * n = the number of terms (what we want to find)\n* Substitute the values into the formula: 990 = 110 + (n-1)11\n* Simplify and solve for n:\n    * 880 = (n-1)11\n    * 80 = n - 1\n    * n = 81\n**Therefore, there are 81 three-digit positive integers that are multiples of 11.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the smallest and largest three-digit multiples of 11:**\n* The smallest three-digit number is 100.  Divide 100 by 11 to get approximately 9.09.  The next whole number, 10, gives us the smallest three-digit multiple of 11: 11 * 10 = 110.\n* The largest three-digit number is 999. Divide 999 by 11 to get approximately 90.82. The largest three-digit multiple of 11 is 11 * 90 = 990.\n**2.  Count the multiples:**\n* We need to count the multiples of 11 from 110 to 990. This is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 11.\n* The general formula to find the number of terms (n) in an arithmetic sequence is: n = (last term - first term)/common difference + 1\n* Applying this to our problem: n = (990 - 110)/11 + 1 = 80/11 + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9\n**Therefore, there are 9 three-digit positive integers that are multiples of 11.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the Smallest Multiple:**\n* The smallest three-digit multiple of 11 is 110 (11 x 10).\n**2. Find the Largest Multiple:**\n* The largest three-digit multiple of 11 is 990 (11 x 90).\n**3. Count the Multiples:**\n* We need to find how many numbers are in the sequence: 110, 121, 132, ..., 990\n* This is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 11. \n* To find the number of terms, we can use the formula: \n   *  n = (last term - first term) / common difference + 1\n   *  n = (990 - 110) / 11 + 1\n   *  n = 880 / 11 + 1\n   *  n = 80 + 1\n   *  n = 81\n**Therefore, there are 81 three-digit positive integers that are multiples of 11.** \n",

Determine the range of multiples:**\n* We need to find all multiples of 11 from 110 to 990.\n**3. Calculate the number of multiples:**\n* Divide the largest multiple by 11: 990 / 11 = 90\n* Divide the smallest multiple by 11: 110 / 11 = 10\n* Subtract the smaller quotient from the larger quotient and add 1 to include both endpoints: 90 - 10 + 1 = **81**\n**Therefore, there are 81 three-digit positive integers that are multiples of 11.** \n",
