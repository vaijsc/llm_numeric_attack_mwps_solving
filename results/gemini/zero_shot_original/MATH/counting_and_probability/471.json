        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Problem:**\nWe need to find the number of ways to choose three cards out of four, where the product of the numbers on those cards is not zero. This means we can't have a zero in our selection.\n**2.  Total Combinations:**\n* The total number of ways to choose 3 cards out of 4 is given by the combination formula:  \u2074C\u2083 = 4! / (3! * 1!) = 4\n**3. Combinations with Zero:**\n* There's only one combination that includes the card with zero (0, 2, 1).\n**4.  Combinations without Zero:**\n*  Since we have 4 total combinations and 1 combination with zero, there are 4 - 1 = 3 combinations that don't include zero.\n**Answer:**\nThere are **3** ways to select three cards so that the product of the numbers on those cards is not zero. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding the Problem**\nWe have four cards with the digits 2, 0, 0, and 1. We want to find the number of ways to choose three cards such that their product is not zero.\n**The Key Insight**\nThe product of three numbers will be zero only if one or more of the numbers is zero.  Since we have two zeros, we need to figure out how many ways we can choose three cards *including* at least one zero.\n**Solution**\n1. **Total ways to choose three cards:**  We have 4 cards, and we're choosing 3, so there are  \u2074C\u2083 = 4 ways to do this.\n2. **Ways to choose three cards with at least one zero:** We can choose one zero and two other digits in \u00b3C\u2081 * \u00b3C\u2082 = 9 ways.  (We choose 1 zero out of 2, and then 2 other digits out of the remaining 3).\n3. **Ways to choose three cards with a non-zero product:** To get the number of ways to choose three cards with a non-zero product, we subtract the ways to choose cards with a zero product from the total number of ways:\n   4 (total ways) - 9 (ways with a zero product) = -5\n**The Problem**\nThe result of -5 doesn't make sense. This means our logic is flawed.  The issue is that we overcounted the ways to choose three cards with at least one zero.  We counted each combination with two zeros twice (once for each zero).\n**Correcting the Solution**\n1. **Ways to choose three cards with at least one zero (corrected):**\n   * We choose one zero and two other digits: \u00b3C\u2081 * \u00b3C\u2082 = 9 ways. \n   * We choose two zeros and one other digit: \u00b3C\u2082 * \u00b3C\u2081 = 9 ways. \n   * But we've double-counted the combinations with two zeros.  We need to subtract the number of times we've counted them: 9 - 3 = 6 ways.\n2. **Ways to choose three cards with a non-zero product:**\n   * 4 (total ways) - 6 (ways with a zero product) = **-2**\n**Again, we get a negative answer!** This means there is no way to choose three cards so that the product is not zero.\n**Final Answer:** There are **0** ways to select three cards so that the product of the numbers on those cards is not zero. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Problem:**\nWe need to find the number of ways to choose 3 cards from the set {2, 0, 0, 1} such that their product is not zero. \n**2. Consider the Restrictions:**\nThe only way the product can be zero is if one of the cards is a 0.  Therefore, we need to avoid selecting any 0 cards.\n**3. Count the Valid Combinations:**\nWe have two non-zero cards (2 and 1). Since we need to select 3 cards, we must include the card with the number 2.  This leaves us with two choices for the remaining two cards:\n* **Choice 1:** Select the '1' card twice.\n* **Choice 2:** Select the '1' card and the '2' card.\n**4. Calculate the Number of Ways:**\nWe have **2** valid ways to choose three cards such that their product is not zero.\n**Therefore, the answer is 2.** \n",

Identify the Constraints:**\n* **Non-zero product:**  To avoid a zero product, we cannot select three cards that include any \"0\". \n* **Distinct cards:** We can't select the same card twice.\n**3.  Possible Selections:**\nSince we must exclude the zeros, the only possible combinations are:\n* {2, 0, 1} \n* {2, 1, 0} \n* {1, 2, 0} \nNotice that these are just rearrangements of the same three numbers. \n**4.

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Condition**\nThe product of the numbers on the three cards must not be zero. This means none of the cards can have the number zero on them.\n**2.  Identify the Available Numbers**\nThe number 2001 has the following digits: 2, 0, 0, and 1. \n**3.  Eliminate the Zero**\nSince we can't use the zero, we're left with three digits: 2, 0, and 1.\n**4.  Calculate the Combinations**\nWe need to select three cards out of three.  This is a simple combination problem:\n* **Combinations Formula:**  nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!) \n   * n = total number of items (3 digits)\n   * r = number of items to choose (3 cards)\n* **Calculation:** 3C3 = 3! / (3! * (3-3)!) = 1\n**Answer:** There is only **1** way to select three different cards so that the product of the numbers on those cards is not zero. \n"
