    "solution": "There are $8!$ ways to place the people around the table, but this counts each valid arrangement 4 times (if you move each person 2, 4, or 6 places clockwise you get the same arrangement).  The answer is $\\dfrac{8!}{4} = \\boxed{10080}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Fix a Person:**\n* Since we're dealing with rotations, imagine fixing one person in a specific seat. This eliminates the issue of rotations creating identical arrangements.\n**2. Arrange the Remaining People:**\n* We have 7 people left to arrange. \n* Let's start with the seat next to the fixed person. There are 7 options for who sits there.\n* For the seat opposite the fixed person, there are 6 options remaining.\n* For the final seat next to the fixed person, there are 5 options remaining.\n**3. Account for Rotations:**\n* We've overcounted because rotations are considered equivalent.  \n* Think about how many distinct rotations are possible for each arrangement.  There are 4 possible rotations for each arrangement (rotate 90 degrees, 180 degrees, 270 degrees, or 360 degrees).\n**4. Calculate the Final Number of Arrangements:**\n*  We need to divide the number of arrangements we calculated in step 2 by the number of rotations to correct for overcounting.\n* Total arrangements: (7 * 6 * 5) / 4 = **105**\n**Therefore, there are 105 ways to seat 8 people around a square table with 2 people on a side.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Fix a Position**\n* Since we're dealing with a circular arrangement (or a square where rotations are equivalent), we can fix one person's position. This eliminates the issue of rotations creating identical arrangements.\n**2.  Assign the Remaining Seats**\n* We now have 7 people left to place.  \n* For the seat next to the fixed person, there are 7 choices.\n* For the seat opposite the fixed person, there are 6 choices left.\n* For the seat next to the opposite person, there are 5 choices left.\n* And so on...\n**3.  Calculate the Possibilities**\n* This gives us a total of 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 7! = 5040 ways to arrange the people.\n**4.  Correct for Overcounting**\n* Notice that we've overcounted because we treated each side of the square as distinct. Since rotations are equivalent, we've counted each arrangement 4 times (once for each side of the square).\n**5.  Final Answer**\n* To get the correct number of arrangements, we divide the initial count by 4: 5040 / 4 = 1260\n**Therefore, there are 1260 ways to seat 8 people around a square table with 2 people on a side, considering rotations as equivalent.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Fix a Person**\n* Imagine one person is already seated. Since it's a circular arrangement (rotation doesn't matter), it doesn't affect the final count who we choose to fix.\n**2.  Fill the Opposite Side**\n* There are 7 people left.  We need to choose one person to sit opposite the first person.  There are 7 ways to do this.\n**3. Fill the Remaining Seats**\n* Now, we have 6 people left. Let's consider one side of the table.  There are 6 ways to choose the person to sit in the seat next to our fixed person.\n* Once that person is seated, the person on the other side of that side is automatically determined (since there are two people per side).\n* We now have 4 people left. There are 4 ways to choose who sits next to the person on the opposite side of our fixed person.\n**4. Calculate the Total**\n* The total number of arrangements is: 7 * 6 * 4 = **168**\n**Therefore, there are 168 ways to seat 8 people around a square table with 2 people on a side.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Fix a Person:**\n* Imagine fixing one person in a specific seat. Since it's a circular arrangement (rotation doesn't change the configuration), it doesn't matter which seat we choose.\n**2. Filling the Remaining Seats:**\n*  Now, we have 7 people left to place.  \n*  There are 3 possible seats for the person sitting to the right of the fixed person. \n*  Once that seat is filled, there are 2 possible seats for the next person to the right. \n*  This continues until we reach the final person.\n**3. Calculating the Possibilities:**\n*  The total number of ways to arrange the remaining 7 people is 3 * 2 * 1 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 = 7! \n**4. Accounting for Rotation:**\n* Since each arrangement can be rotated to create 4 identical arrangements, we need to divide by 4.\n**5. Final Calculation:**\nThe final answer is (7!)/4 = (5040)/4 = **1260**\n**Therefore, there are 1260 ways to seat 8 people around a square table with 2 people on a side.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Fix a Position**\n* Since rotations are considered equivalent, let's fix one person's position.  This eliminates the problem of overcounting due to rotation.\n**2. Assign the Remaining Seats**\n*  Now we have 7 people left to arrange.  \n*  Think of the square table as having four \"sides\".  We need to place 2 people on each side.\n**3.  Choices for the First Side**\n*  We have 7 choices for the first seat on one side. \n*  We have 6 choices left for the second seat on that same side.\n**4. Choices for the Remaining Sides**\n* Once we've filled one side, there are 5 people left.  We can place them in any order on the remaining three sides.  \n**5.  Calculate the Total Number of Arrangements**\n*  The total number of ways to arrange the people is: 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 5040\n**6. Account for Overcounting**\n* We've overcounted because we've treated each side as distinct.  Since we're dealing with a square, there are only 4 unique orientations.  \n*  Divide our previous result by 4: 5040 / 4 = 1260\n**Answer:** There are **1260** ways to seat 8 people around a square table with 2 people on a side. \n"
