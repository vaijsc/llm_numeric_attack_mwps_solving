    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are five odd digits and four even digits to be used. Because the digits must alternate between odd and even, this means that there is only one possible way to distribute odds (O) and evens (E): OEOEOEOEO. Now, there are $5\\cdot 4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2 = 120$ ways to arrange the odd numbers, as there are five choices for the first slot, four for the second, and so on. Similarly, there are $4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 = 24$ ways to arrange the even numbers. Our final answer is the product of $120$ and $24$, which is $\\boxed{2880}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step by step:\n**1.  Determine the Starting Digit:**\n* Since the number must alternate between odd and even, it can start with either an odd or even digit. This gives us two possibilities.\n**2.  Consider the Number of Choices:**\n* For the first digit, we have 5 choices (1, 3, 5, 7, or 9).\n* For the second digit, we have 4 choices (the remaining even digits if we started odd, or the remaining odd digits if we started even).\n* For the third digit, we have 3 choices, and so on.\n**3.  Calculate the Total Possibilities:**\n* If we start with an odd digit, the total number of possibilities is: 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 5! * 4! = 120 * 24 = 2880\n* If we start with an even digit, the total number of possibilities is also 2880.\n**4.  Combine the Possibilities:**\n* Since we can start with either an odd or even digit, we add the possibilities: 2880 + 2880 = 5760\n**Answer:** There are **5760** nine-digit numbers that can be made using each of the digits 1 through 9 exactly once, with the digits alternating between odd and even. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Determine the Starting Digit:**\n* Since the digits must alternate between odd and even, we have two choices for the first digit: an odd number or an even number.\n**2.  Calculate the Possibilities for the Remaining Digits:**\n* Once we've chosen the first digit, the remaining digits are fixed.  If the first digit is odd, the second must be even, the third odd, and so on.\n* For each odd position (1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th), we have 5 choices (the odd digits).\n* For each even position (2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th), we have 4 choices (the even digits).\n**3. Calculate the Total Number of Possibilities:**\n* **Case 1: Starting with an odd digit:**  We have 5 choices for the first digit, 4 for the second, 5 for the third, and so on. This gives us a total of 5 * 4 * 5 * 4 * 5 * 4 * 5 * 4 * 5 = 5^5 * 4^4 possibilities.\n* **Case 2: Starting with an even digit:** This is exactly the same as Case 1, giving us 5^5 * 4^4 possibilities.\n**4. Add the Possibilities from Both Cases:**\n* Since we can start with either an odd or even digit, we add the possibilities from both cases: 5^5 * 4^4 + 5^5 * 4^4 = 2 * 5^5 * 4^4\n**Therefore, there are 2 * 5^5 * 4^4 = 128,000 nine-digit numbers that can be made using the digits 1 through 9 exactly once with alternating odd and even digits.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Determine the Starting Digit:**\n*  Since we need alternating odd and even digits, the number can start with either an odd or even digit. This gives us two possibilities.\n**2.  Calculate the Number of Choices for Each Position:**\n* **First Position:** 5 choices (any of the odd or even digits)\n* **Second Position:** 4 choices (the remaining digits of the opposite parity)\n* **Third Position:** 3 choices (the remaining digits of the same parity as the first)\n* **And so on...**\n**3.  Calculate the Total Possibilities:**\n* For each starting choice (odd or even), we have: 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 5! * 4!  arrangements.\n* Since we have two possible starting digits, the total number of arrangements is: 2 * 5! * 4! = 2 * 120 * 24 = **5760**\n**Therefore, there are 5760 nine-digit numbers that can be made using each of the digits 1 through 9 exactly once with alternating odd and even digits.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Determine the Starting Digit:**\n* We have two choices for the first digit: either an odd number or an even number.\n**2.  Alternating Pattern:**\n*  Once we choose the first digit (odd or even), the remaining digits must alternate between odd and even.\n**3.  Counting the Possibilities:**\n* **Case 1:  Odd Digit First**\n    * There are 5 choices for the first digit (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).\n    * There are 4 choices for the second digit (any of the even numbers).\n    * There are 4 choices for the third digit (any of the remaining odd numbers), and so on.\n    * This gives us a total of 5 * 4 * 4 * 3 * 3 * 2 * 2 * 1 * 1 = 5! * 4! = 34,560 possibilities.\n* **Case 2: Even Digit First**\n    * The same logic applies, but we start with an even number.\n    * This also gives us 5! * 4! = 34,560 possibilities.\n**4.  Total Possibilities:**\n*  Since we have two cases (odd first or even first), the total number of nine-digit numbers is 34,560 + 34,560 = **69,120**. \n",
