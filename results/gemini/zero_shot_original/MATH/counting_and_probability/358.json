    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "We count the complement. A cube that does not touch the bottom or a lateral side either touches only the top side or no sides at all. These cubes form a $2\\times2\\times3$ prism, giving 12 cubes. These 12 cubes are subtracted from 64 to leave $\\boxed{52}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Cube**\nImagine a 4x4x4 cube.  Think of it as a 3D grid with 4 layers, each containing 4x4 smaller cubes.\n**2. Cubes Touching the Bottom**\n* The bottom layer of the cube has 4 x 4 = 16 small cubes that touch the bottom of the box.\n**3. Cubes Touching the Sides**\n* Each of the four sides of the box has a 4x3 = 12 row of small cubes that touch the side.\n* Since there are four sides, this gives us 12 x 4 = 48 cubes.\n**4. Overlap**\n* Notice that the cubes along the edges of the bottom layer have been counted twice (once for the bottom and once for a side).  There are 4 edges on the bottom, each with 3 cubes that were counted twice.\n* This means we've overcounted 3 x 4 = 12 cubes.\n**5. Final Calculation**\n* Total cubes touching the bottom or sides: 16 (bottom) + 48 (sides) - 12 (overlap) = **52**\n**Therefore, 52 of the small cubes touch the bottom or one of the four lateral sides of the box.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Cube:**\nImagine a 4x4x4 cube.  We want to find the cubes that touch the bottom or sides. \n**2.  The Bottom Layer:**\n* All 16 cubes in the bottom layer touch the bottom of the box.\n**3.  The Lateral Sides:**\n* Each lateral side of the box has 4 rows of cubes that touch it. \n* Since there are 4 sides, there are 4 * 4 = 16 cubes touching the lateral sides.\n**4.  Overlap:**\n* Notice that the corner cubes are counted twice \u2013 once for the bottom and once for a side. \n* There are 4 corner cubes that are counted twice.\n**5.  Calculate the Total:**\n* Total cubes touching the bottom or sides: 16 (bottom) + 16 (sides) - 4 (overlap) = **28**\n**Therefore, 28 of the small cubes touch the bottom or one of the four lateral sides of the box.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Cube**\nImagine a 4x4x4 cube.  Since the box is open, there's no top.\n**2. Focus on the Bottom**\n* The bottom layer has 16 small cubes (4 x 4). \n* All 16 of these cubes touch the bottom of the box.\n**3. Consider the Sides**\n* Each of the four sides has a 4x4 grid of cubes.\n* However, the bottom row of each side is already counted (because they touch the bottom).\n*  So, each side has 3 rows of cubes that touch the side (4 x 3 = 12 cubes).\n*  Since there are four sides, this means there are 48 cubes touching the sides (12 cubes/side x 4 sides = 48 cubes).\n**4.  Avoid Double Counting**\n*  We've counted the bottom row of cubes on each side twice (once for the bottom, once for the side).\n*  We need to subtract the number of cubes that are on the edges.\n*  There are 12 edge cubes (4 edges x 3 cubes per edge).\n**5. Calculate the Total**\n*  Total cubes touching the bottom or sides: 16 (bottom) + 48 (sides) - 12 (double-counted) = **52 cubes**\n**Therefore, 52 of the small cubes touch the bottom or one of the four lateral sides of the box.** \n",

Bottom Cubes:**\n* The bottom layer of the cube has 16 small cubes that touch the bottom.\n**3. Side Cubes:**\n* Each of the four lateral sides has a 4x4 grid of small cubes, but we need to be careful not to count the bottom layer twice. \n* Each side has 4 rows of cubes that touch the side, with 3 cubes in each row (since the bottom row is already counted).\n* There are 4 sides, so this gives us 4 * 4 * 3 = 48 side cubes.\n**4. Total Cubes:**\n* Add the bottom cubes and the side cubes: 16 + 48 = 64\n**Therefore, all 64 small cubes touch either the bottom or one of the lateral sides of the box.** \n",

Total Cubes Touching Sides**\n* There are 4 sides, and each side has 3 additional rows of touching cubes (3 rows/side x 4 sides = 12 rows).\n* Each row has 4 cubes (4 cubes/row x 12 rows = 48 cubes).\n**5.
