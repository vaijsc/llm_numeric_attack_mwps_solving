    "solution": "We calculate the complement, or the probability that Michael does not roll at least two 1's, and then subtract from 1.  If Michael does not roll at least two 1's, he must roll either zero or one.  The probability that he rolls no 1's is  $$\\frac{5}{6}\\cdot\\frac{5}{6}\\cdot\\frac{5}{6} = \\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^3 = \\frac{125}{216}$$The probability that he rolls one 1 is $$\\left(\\binom{3}{1}\\cdot\\frac{1}{6}\\right)\\cdot\\frac{5}{6}\\cdot\\frac{5}{6} = \\binom{3}{1}\\left(\\frac{25}{216}\\right) = \\frac{75}{216},$$since we can choose which of the dice rolled a 1 in $\\binom{3}{1}$ ways.  Thus our answer is $1-\\frac{125}{216}-\\frac{75}{216} = \\frac{16}{216}=\\boxed{\\frac{2}{27}}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1.  Calculate the total possible outcomes:**\n* Each die has 6 sides.\n* With three dice, there are 6 * 6 * 6 = 216 possible combinations.\n**2. Calculate the outcomes with exactly two 1's:**\n*  **Choose the two dice that will be 1's:** There are 3 ways to do this (first and second, first and third, or second and third).\n*  **The remaining die can be anything other than a 1:** There are 5 possibilities.\n*  So, there are 3 * 5 = 15 outcomes with exactly two 1's.\n**3. Calculate the outcomes with three 1's:**\n* There's only 1 outcome where all three dice are 1's.\n**4. Calculate the total outcomes with at least two 1's:**\n* There are 15 + 1 = 16 outcomes with at least two 1's.\n**5. Calculate the probability:**\n* Probability = (Favorable outcomes) / (Total possible outcomes)\n* Probability = 16 / 216 \n* Probability = **8/108**  (simplify to lowest terms)\n**Therefore, the probability of Michael rolling at least two 1's is 8/108.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Possible Outcomes**\n* Each die has 6 sides, so there are 6 * 6 * 6 = 216 possible outcomes when rolling three dice.\n**2.  Favorable Outcomes**\n* **Case 1: Exactly two 1's:**\n   *  We need two 1's and one other number. \n   *  There are 5 choices for the non-1 number (2, 3, 4, 5, or 6).\n   *  The 1's can be in any of the three positions (11X, 1X1, or X11), giving us 3 arrangements.\n   *  This gives us 5 * 3 = 15 outcomes with exactly two 1's.\n* **Case 2: Three 1's:**\n    * There's only one way to get three 1's.\n**3.  Total Favorable Outcomes**\n* The total number of favorable outcomes is 15 (two 1's) + 1 (three 1's) = 16\n**4.  Probability**\n* The probability of rolling at least two 1's is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes: 16/216.\n**5.  Simplifying the Fraction**\n* Both 16 and 216 are divisible by 8. Simplifying the fraction gives us **2/27**. \n",

Calculate the outcomes with exactly two 1's:**\n*  We need two 1's and one other number (which can be anything from 2 to 6).\n* There are 5 ways to choose the non-1 number.\n* We need to account for the order (e.g., 1, 1, 3 is different from 1, 3, 1).  There are 3! = 6 ways to arrange three distinct things.\n*  So, there are 5 * 6 = 30 outcomes with exactly two 1's.\n**3. Calculate the outcomes with three 1's:**\n* There's only one way to get three 1's (1, 1, 1).\n**4. Calculate the total outcomes with at least two 1's:**\n* There are 30 outcomes with exactly two 1's + 1 outcome with three 1's = 31 total outcomes.\n**5.
