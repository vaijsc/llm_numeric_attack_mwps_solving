(n factorial) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. \n* 18! = 18 * 17 * 16 * 15 * 14 * ... * 2 * 1\n* 16! = 16 * 15 * 14 * ... * 2 * 1\n**Step 2:  Cancel out common factors**\nNotice that both 18! and 16! have the same factors from 16 down to 1. These factors will cancel out:\n```\n   18 * 17 * 16 * 15 * 14 * ... * 2 * 1 \n--------------------------------------- = \n  16 * 15 * 14 * ... * 2 * 1  \n```\n**Step 3: Simplify**\nAfter cancellation, we are left with:\n18 * 17 = **306**\nTherefore,  $\\frac{18!}{16!} = \\boxed{306}$. \n",
