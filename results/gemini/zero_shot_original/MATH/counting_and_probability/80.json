        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Simplify the right side of the equation:**\n*  25 + 2(5)(3) + 9 = 25 + 30 + 9 = 64\n**2. Rewrite the equation:**\n*  The equation becomes:  \n   (x/3)\u00b3 - 3x\u00b2 + 81x - 729 = 64\n**3. Move all terms to one side:**\n*  (x/3)\u00b3 - 3x\u00b2 + 81x - 729 - 64 = 0\n*  (x/3)\u00b3 - 3x\u00b2 + 81x - 793 = 0\n**4. Factor out a common factor:**\n*  Notice that all the coefficients are divisible by 3.  We can factor out a 3 from the left side:\n   3[(x/3)\u00b3 - x\u00b2 + 27x - 264.33] = 0\n**5.  Recognize the pattern:**\n*  The expression inside the brackets looks like a cubic polynomial that might factor. Let's try grouping:\n    *  (x/3)\u00b3 - x\u00b2  + 27x - 264.33 = [(x/3)\u00b3 - x\u00b2] + [27x - 264.33]\n**6. Factor by grouping:**\n*  Factor out x\u00b2 from the first group and 27 from the second group:\n    *  x\u00b2(x/3 - 1) + 27(x - 9.8) = 0\n**7. Find a common factor:**\n* Notice that both terms now share a common factor of (x/3 - 1):\n    *  (x/3 - 1)(x\u00b2 + 27) = 0\n**8. Solve for x:**\n* For the product of two factors to be zero, at least one of them must be zero. So we have two cases:\n    *  Case 1: x/3 - 1 = 0 \n         *  Solving for x, we get x = 3\n    *  Case 2: x\u00b2 + 27 = 0\n         *  This equation has no real solutions because x\u00b2 is always non-negative, and adding 27 to it will always result in a positive number.\n**Therefore, the only real solution to the equation is x = 3.** \n",

We can rewrite it as:\n  (x/3)\u00b3 - 3x\u00b2(3) + 3x(27) - 27\u00b3 = 0\nNow we can factor out common terms:\n  (x/3)\u00b3 - 3x\u00b2(3) + 3x(27) - 27\u00b3 = 0\n  (x/3)\u00b3 - 3x\u00b2(3) + 3x(27) - 27\u00b3 = (x/3 - 27)((x/3)\u00b2 + 9x + 27\u00b2) = 0\n**6.  Solve for x:**\nWe now have two factors that must equal zero:\n* **Case 1:**  (x/3 - 27) = 0 \n  Solving for x, we get: x = 81\n* **Case 2:** (x/3)\u00b2 + 9x + 27\u00b2 = 0 \n  This is a quadratic equation. We can try to factor it, but it doesn't factor easily. We can use the quadratic formula:\n  x = [-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)] / 2a\n  where a = 1/9, b = 9, and c = 27\u00b2\n  After plugging in and simplifying, we find that the discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac) is negative. This means the quadratic equation has no real solutions.\n**7.  Solution:**\nThe only real solution to the original equation is **x = 81**. \n",

Rewrite the Equation**\nNow our equation looks like this:\n  \n  (x/3)\u00b3 - 3x\u00b2 + 81x - 729 = 64\n**3.

Factor the Left Side**\nThe left side looks a bit intimidating, but we can factor it by recognizing a pattern:\n*  793 = 19\u00b3\n*  81 = 3\u2074\nThis suggests a possible factorization:\n(x/3 - 19)(x\u00b2 + 57x + 396) = 0\n**5.  Solve for x**\nNow we have two factors that multiply to zero.  This means at least one of them must be zero:\n* **Factor 1:** (x/3 - 19) = 0  \n   Solving for x, we get x = 57\n* **Factor 2:**  x\u00b2 + 57x + 396 = 0\n   This quadratic equation doesn't factor easily. We can use the quadratic formula to find the solutions:\n   x = [-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)] / 2a \n   Where a = 1, b = 57, and c = 396.

Recognize the pattern:**\nNotice that the coefficients on the left side are almost in a geometric sequence (with common ratio 3). To make it easier to work with, multiply both sides of the equation by 27:\n$$x^3 - 81x^2 + 2187x - 21411 = 0$$\nNow the coefficients form a geometric sequence with first term 1 and common ratio 3. This suggests that the equation might factor nicely.\n**5.  Factor by grouping:**\nGroup the terms:\n$$(x^3 - 81x^2) + (2187x - 21411) = 0$$\nFactor out a common factor from each group:\n$$x^2(x - 81) + 2187(x - 81) = 0$$\nNow we have a common factor of $(x - 81)$:\n$$(x - 81)(x^2 + 2187) = 0$$\n**6.  Solve for x:**\nFor the product of two factors to be zero, at least one of them must be zero.  So we have two possibilities:\n* **Case 1:**  $x - 81 = 0$, which gives us $x = 81$.\n* **Case 2:** $x^2 + 2187 = 0$. This equation has no real solutions, since the square of a real number is always non-negative.\n**Therefore, the only real solution to the equation is  $x = \\boxed{81}$.** \n"
