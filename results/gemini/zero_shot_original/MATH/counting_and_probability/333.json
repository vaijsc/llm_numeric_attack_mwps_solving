    "solution": "First we count the arrangements if the three E's are unique, which is $5!$. Then since the E's are not unique, we divide by $3!$ for the arrangements of E, for an answer of $\\dfrac{5!}{3!} = \\boxed{20}$.",

        "Here's how to determine the number of ways to arrange the letters of the word TEPEE:\n**1. Count the letters:**\n* There are 5 letters in total.\n**2. Identify repeated letters:**\n* The letter 'E' appears 3 times.\n* The letter 'P' appears 2 times.\n**3. Calculate the arrangements:**\n* If all letters were unique, we would have 5! (5 factorial) ways to arrange them, which is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.\n* However, we need to account for the repeated letters. We divide by the factorial of the number of times each letter repeats. \n*  So, the total number of arrangements is: 5! / (3! * 2!) = 120 / (6 * 2) = 10\n**Therefore, there are 10 different ways to arrange the letters of the word TEPEE.** \n",

Identify repetitions:**\n* The letter 'E' appears 3 times. \n* The letter 'P' appears 2 times.\n**3. Calculate the arrangements without considering repetitions:**\n* If all letters were unique, there would be 5! (5 factorial) ways to arrange them: 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120\n**4. Account for repetitions:**\n* To avoid counting arrangements as distinct when they're actually just rearrangements of the repeated letters, we divide by the factorial of the number of repetitions for each letter:\n    * Divide by 3! (3 factorial) for the letter 'E' (3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6).\n    * Divide by 2! (2 factorial) for the letter 'P' (2! = 2 * 1 = 2).\n**5. Final Calculation:**\nThe number of ways to arrange the letters of the word TEPEE is:\n120 / (3! * 2!) = 120 / (6 * 2) = 120 / 12 = **10**\n**Therefore, there are 10 distinct ways to arrange the letters of the word TEPEE.** \n",

Identify repetitions:**\n* The letter 'E' appears 3 times.\n* The letter 'P' appears 2 times.\n**3. Apply the formula:**\nThe number of ways to arrange *n* objects, where *r* objects are identical and *s* objects are identical, is:\nn! / (r! * s!)\n**4. Calculate:**\nIn this case:\n* n = 5 (total letters)\n* r = 3 (number of 'E's)\n* s = 2 (number of 'P's)\nSo, the number of arrangements is:\n5! / (3! * 2!) = (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((3 * 2 * 1) * (2 * 1)) = 120 / (6 * 2) = 120 / 12 = **10**\n**Therefore, there are 10 different ways to arrange the letters of the word TEPEE.** \n",
