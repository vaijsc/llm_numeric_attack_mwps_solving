        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Understand the Shape**\nA pentagonal prism has two pentagonal bases connected by five rectangular sides.  \n**2. Diagonals Within the Bases**\n* Each pentagon has 5 vertices.\n* A diagonal connects two non-adjacent vertices. \n* To find the number of diagonals in one pentagon, we can use the formula:  n(n-3)/2, where n is the number of sides (or vertices).  \n* For a pentagon (n=5): 5(5-3)/2 = 5 diagonals.\n* Since there are two pentagonal bases, there are a total of 5 * 2 = 10 diagonals within the bases.\n**3. Diagonals Connecting Bases**\n*  Imagine drawing a diagonal from a vertex on one pentagon to a vertex on the other pentagon. \n*  Each vertex on one pentagon can connect to 5 different vertices on the other pentagon.\n*  Since there are 5 vertices on each pentagon, we have 5 * 5 = 25 possible connections.\n*  However, we've overcounted.  Each rectangular side already connects two vertices on different bases, so we need to subtract the 5 rectangular sides.\n*  This gives us 25 - 5 = 20 diagonals connecting the bases.\n**4. Total Diagonals**\nAdd the diagonals from the bases and the diagonals connecting the bases: 10 + 20 = **30 diagonals**\n**Therefore, a pentagonal prism has 30 diagonals.** \n",

Diagonals within the Pentagons:**\n* Each pentagon has 5 vertices.\n*  To find the number of diagonals within one pentagon, we use the formula:  n(n-3)/2  where n is the number of vertices.\n*  So, each pentagon has 5(5-3)/2 = 5 diagonals.\n* Since there are two pentagons, we have a total of 5 * 2 = 10 diagonals within the pentagons.\n**2. Diagonals between the Pentagons:**\n* Each vertex of one pentagon can be connected to 5 vertices of the other pentagon. \n* This gives us 5 * 5 = 25 potential connections. \n* However, we've counted each connecting line segment twice (once for each endpoint).\n* Therefore, there are 25/2 = 12.5 diagonals between the pentagons. Since we can't have half a diagonal, we round down to 12.\n**3. Total Diagonals:**\n* Add the diagonals within the pentagons and the diagonals between the pentagons: 10 + 12 = 22\n**Therefore, a pentagonal prism has 22 diagonals.** \n",

Diagonals within the Pentagons:**\n* Each pentagon has 5 vertices.\n* A diagonal connects two non-adjacent vertices.\n*  The formula for the number of diagonals in an *n*-sided polygon is *n*(n-3)/2. \n* For a pentagon (n=5), there are 5(5-3)/2 = **5 diagonals** in each pentagon.\n**2. Diagonals between Pentagons:**\n* Each vertex of one pentagon can be connected to 5 vertices of the other pentagon (excluding the two vertices it's already connected to by the prism's edges).\n*  Since there are 5 vertices in each pentagon, this gives us 5 * 5 = **25 diagonals**.\n**3.

Diagonals between the two pentagons:**\n* Each vertex on one pentagon can be connected to 4 vertices on the other pentagon (since it cannot be connected to the one directly across from it).\n* Total diagonals between the pentagons: 5 * 4 = 20 \n**4.

        "Here's how to break down the problem and find the solution:\n**1. Understand the Shape**\n* A pentagonal prism has two congruent pentagons as its bases and five rectangular faces connecting them.\n**2. Identify Types of Diagonals**\n* **Base Diagonals:** These connect non-adjacent vertices within the same pentagonal base. Each pentagon has 5 vertices, and each vertex can connect to 2 other non-adjacent vertices. So, each pentagon has 5 * 2 / 2 = 5 diagonals. Since there are two bases, we have 5 * 2 = 10 base diagonals.\n* **Face Diagonals:** These connect non-adjacent vertices on the rectangular faces. Each rectangle has 2 diagonals, and there are 5 rectangular faces, so there are 2 * 5 = 10 face diagonals.\n* **Space Diagonals:** These connect vertices from one base to the other. We can think of this as picking one vertex on one base and connecting it to any vertex on the other base that's not directly above or below it. Each vertex on one base has 3 possibilities on the other base, and there are 5 vertices on each base. So, there are 3 * 5 = 15 space diagonals.\n**3. Calculate the Total**\n* Add the number of each type of diagonal: 10 (base) + 10 (face) + 15 (space) = **35 diagonals**\n**Therefore, a pentagonal prism has 35 diagonals.** \n"
