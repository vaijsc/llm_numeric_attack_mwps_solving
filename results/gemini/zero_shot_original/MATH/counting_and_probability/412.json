However, the two pairs of balls are interchangeable, so we must divide by 2 to get $6 / 2 = 3$ arrangements.\n\n(2,1,1): There are $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ options for picking the two balls to go in one box, and each of the other two balls goes into its own box.\n\nThe total number of arrangements is $1 + 4 + 3 + 6 = \\boxed{14}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**Understanding the Problem**\n* **Distinguishable balls:** Each ball is unique (e.g., they could be different colors).\n* **Indistinguishable boxes:** We don't care about the order of the boxes, only how many balls are in each.\n**Possible Scenarios**\nWe need to consider all the ways we can distribute the 4 balls into 3 boxes.  Here are the possibilities:\n* **Scenario 1:** 3 balls in one box, 1 ball in another, and 0 balls in the third.\n* **Scenario 2:** 2 balls in one box, 2 balls in another, and 0 balls in the third.\n**Calculating the Number of Ways**\n* **Scenario 1:**  \n   * We have 4 choices for which ball goes in the box with 3 balls.\n   * Then, we have 3 choices for which ball goes in the box with 1 ball.\n   * This gives us 4 * 3 = 12 ways. \n   * However, since the boxes are indistinguishable, we've overcounted. We've counted each arrangement 3! (3*2*1 = 6) times because we could have placed the same balls in the same boxes in a different order.\n   * So, for Scenario 1, we have 12 / 6 = 2 ways.\n* **Scenario 2:**\n   * We have 4 choices for which ball goes in the first box with 2 balls.\n   * Then, we have 3 choices for which ball goes in the second box with 2 balls.\n   * This gives us 4 * 3 = 12 ways.\n   * Again, we need to adjust for overcounting. We've counted each arrangement 2! (2*1 = 2) times because we could have placed the same balls in the same boxes in a different order. \n   * So, for Scenario 2, we have 12 / 2 = 6 ways.\n**Total Ways**\nAdding the ways from each scenario, there are a total of 2 + 6 = **8 ways** to put 4 distinguishable balls into 3 indistinguishable boxes. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding the Problem**\n* **Distinguishable balls:**  This means we can tell the balls apart (e.g., ball 1, ball 2, etc.).\n* **Indistinguishable boxes:** This means we don't care about the order of the boxes, only the number of balls in each.\n**Solution**\nSince we're only concerned about the number of balls in each box, we can use a technique called \"stars and bars.\"\n1. **Stars:** Represent the balls as stars: ****\n2. **Bars:** We need two bars to divide the stars into three groups: **|**\nNow, arrange the stars and bars.  For example:\n* **|****|  :**  This represents 0 balls in the first box, 4 balls in the second box, and 0 balls in the third box.\nTo find the total number of arrangements, we need to figure out how many ways we can arrange 6 items (4 stars and 2 bars).\n* There are 6! (6 factorial) ways to arrange 6 distinct items.\n* But, the stars are identical, and the bars are identical.  \n* We need to divide by 4! to account for the repetitions of the stars and 2! to account for the repetitions of the bars.\nTherefore, the number of ways to arrange the stars and bars is:\n6! / (4! * 2!) = (6 * 5) / (2 * 1) = 15\n**Answer:** There are **15** ways to put 4 distinguishable balls into 3 indistinguishable boxes. \n",

Imagine the balls are arranged like this: (Ball 1, Ball 2, Ball 3) in Box 1 and (Ball 4) in Box 2. This is the same arrangement as if the boxes were swapped. \n   * To figure out how much we've overcounted, think about how many ways to arrange the boxes. There are 3! (3 factorial) ways to arrange 3 boxes, which is 3 * 2 * 1 = 6.\n4. **Final Calculation:** Divide the total possibilities by the number of ways to arrange the boxes: 81 / 6 = **13.5**.\n**Since we can't have half a way, we round down. There are 13 ways to put 4 distinguishable balls into 3 indistinguishable boxes.** \n",
