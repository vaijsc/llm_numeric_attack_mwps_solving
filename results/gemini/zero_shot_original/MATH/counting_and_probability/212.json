        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understanding the Problem:**\nWe need to find how many different positive integers can be created by subtracting any two numbers from the set {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13}.  \n**2.  Finding Differences:**\nLet's systematically find the differences:\n* **1:**  1 - 1 = 0 (not positive)\n* **3:**  3 - 1 = 2, 3 - 3 = 0 (not positive)\n* **5:**  5 - 1 = 4, 5 - 3 = 2, 5 - 5 = 0 (not positive)\n* **7:**  7 - 1 = 6, 7 - 3 = 4, 7 - 5 = 2, 7 - 7 = 0 (not positive)\n* **9:** 9 - 1 = 8, 9 - 3 = 6, 9 - 5 = 4, 9 - 7 = 2, 9 - 9 = 0 (not positive)\n* **11:** 11 - 1 = 10, 11 - 3 = 8, 11 - 5 = 6, 11 - 7 = 4, 11 - 9 = 2, 11 - 11 = 0 (not positive)\n* **13:** 13 - 1 = 12, 13 - 3 = 10, 13 - 5 = 8, 13 - 7 = 6, 13 - 9 = 4, 13 - 11 = 2, 13 - 13 = 0 (not positive)\n**3. Counting Distinct Positive Integers:**\nWe've found the following distinct positive differences: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12.\n**Answer:** There are **6** distinct positive integers that can be represented as the difference of two numbers in the set. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step by step:\n**1. Understand the Problem:**\nWe need to find how many different positive integers can be created by subtracting any two numbers from the given set.\n**2.  Systematic Approach:**\n* **Start with the largest number:**  Begin with 13 and find its differences with all the other numbers:\n   * 13 - 11 = 2\n   * 13 - 9 = 4\n   * 13 - 7 = 6\n   * 13 - 5 = 8\n   * 13 - 3 = 10\n   * 13 - 1 = 12\n* **Move to the next largest number:** Now, take 11 and find its differences with the remaining numbers (we've already considered 13):\n    * 11 - 9 = 2\n    * 11 - 7 = 4\n    * 11 - 5 = 6\n    * 11 - 3 = 8\n    * 11 - 1 = 10\n* **Continue this process:**  Repeat for the remaining numbers in the set (9, 7, 5, 3, 1), making sure not to repeat differences you've already found.\n**3.  Identify Distinct Differences:**\nYou'll notice that as you work through this process, you'll get the following distinct positive differences:\n* 2\n* 4\n* 6\n* 8\n* 10\n* 12\n**4.  Final Answer:**\nThere are **6** distinct positive integers that can be represented as the difference of two numbers in the set. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Problem**\nWe need to find all the possible differences we can get by subtracting any two numbers from the set {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13}.  We only care about the *magnitude* of the difference, so 3 - 1 is the same as 1 - 3.\n**2.  Systematic Approach**\nLet's start by listing out the differences, being careful to avoid duplicates:\n* **Differences involving 1:**\n    * 3 - 1 = 2\n    * 5 - 1 = 4\n    * 7 - 1 = 6\n    * 9 - 1 = 8\n    * 11 - 1 = 10\n    * 13 - 1 = 12\n* **Differences involving 3:**\n    * 5 - 3 = 2\n    * 7 - 3 = 4\n    * 9 - 3 = 6\n    * 11 - 3 = 8\n    * 13 - 3 = 10 \n* **Differences involving 5:**\n    * 7 - 5 = 2\n    * 9 - 5 = 4\n    * 11 - 5 = 6\n    * 13 - 5 = 8\n* **Differences involving 7:**\n    * 9 - 7 = 2\n    * 11 - 7 = 4\n    * 13 - 7 = 6\n* **Differences involving 9:**\n    * 11 - 9 = 2\n    * 13 - 9 = 4\n* **Differences involving 11:**\n    * 13 - 11 = 2\n**3. Count the Distinct Differences**\nWe've found the following distinct differences: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12.\n**Answer:** There are **6** distinct positive integers that can be represented as the difference of two numbers in the set. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\nWe need to find how many different positive integers can be created by subtracting any two numbers from the given set.  \n**2.  Systematic Approach**\n* **Smallest Difference:** The smallest difference we can get is 1 (e.g., 3 - 2).\n* **Largest Difference:** The largest difference we can get is 12 (e.g., 13 - 1). \n* **Possible Differences:** We need to check if we can get all the integers between 1 and 12 as differences.\n**3.  Finding the Differences**\nLet's systematically find the differences:\n* **Difference of 1:**  We can get this by subtracting consecutive numbers (e.g., 3 - 2, 5 - 4, etc.)\n* **Difference of 2:** We can get this by subtracting numbers two positions apart (e.g., 5 - 3, 7 - 5, etc.)\n* **Difference of 3:** We can get this by subtracting numbers three positions apart (e.g., 7 - 4, 9 - 6, etc.)\n* **And so on...**\n**4. Analyzing the Results**\nNotice that we can get all the even differences (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12) by subtracting numbers that are an even number of positions apart. We can also get all the odd differences (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11) by subtracting numbers that are an odd number of positions apart.\n**5. The Answer**\nTherefore, we can get all the positive integers from 1 to 12 as differences. This means there are **12** distinct positive integers that can be represented. \n",

Understand the Problem**\nWe need to find how many different positive integers we can get by subtracting any two numbers from the set {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13}.\n**2.  Systematic Approach**\n* **Smallest Difference:**  The smallest possible difference is 1 - 3 = -2.  Since we only want positive integers, we can ignore negative differences.\n* **Largest Difference:** The largest possible difference is 13 - 1 = 12.\n* **Finding all the Differences:**  We can systematically find all the possible differences by considering each number in the set as the larger number and subtracting each smaller number from it.\n**3. Listing the Differences**\nLet's list the differences:\n* **Starting with 13:** 13 - 1 = 12, 13 - 3 = 10, 13 - 5 = 8, 13 - 7 = 6, 13 - 9 = 4, 13 - 11 = 2 \n* **Starting with 11:** 11 - 1 = 10, 11 - 3 = 8, 11 - 5 = 6, 11 - 7 = 4, 11 - 9 = 2\n* **Starting with 9:** 9 - 1 = 8, 9 - 3 = 6, 9 - 5 = 4, 9 - 7 = 2\n* **Starting with 7:** 7 - 1 = 6, 7 - 3 = 4, 7 - 5 = 2\n* **Starting with 5:** 5 - 1 = 4, 5 - 3 = 2\n* **Starting with 3:** 3 - 1 = 2\n**4.
