    "solution": "There is a $\\frac{1}{3}$ probability that a person will order a meat brat, a $\\frac{1}{3}$ probability that they will order a hot dog, and a $\\frac{1}{3}$ probability that they will order a veggie brat. We can choose which two people we want to order meat brats in $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways, and then we want the other two to order hot dogs. Once we've set who we want to order what, there is a $\\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right) ^4=\\frac{1}{81}$ probability that they all actually order what we want them to. Therefore, the probability that two people order meat brats and the other two hot dogs is $6\\cdot \\frac{1}{81}=\\boxed{\\frac{2}{27}}$.",

        "Here's how to break down the probability calculation:\n**1. Total Possible Outcomes:**\n* Each person has 3 choices (meat brat, hot dog, veggie brat).\n* With 4 people, there are 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 81 total possible combinations of orders.\n**2. Favorable Outcomes:**\n* We want 2 meat brats and 2 hot dogs.  Let's figure out the ways this can happen:\n    * **Choose the 2 people getting meat brats:**  There are 4C2 (4 choose 2) ways to do this, which is 6.\n    * **The other 2 automatically get hot dogs.**\n**3. Calculate the Probability:**\n* **Probability = (Favorable Outcomes) / (Total Possible Outcomes)**\n* Probability = 6 / 81 \n* Probability = 2/27\n**Therefore, the probability that 2 people order meat brats and the other 2 order hot dogs is 2/27.** \n",

        "Here's how we can break down the probability calculation:\n**1.  Possible Combinations**\n* We need to figure out how many ways 2 people can order meat brats and 2 people can order hot dogs.

Total Probability**\n* Since there are 6 equally likely combinations, we multiply the probability of one combination (1/81) by 6: \n    * (1/81) * 6 = 6/81 \n**4.
