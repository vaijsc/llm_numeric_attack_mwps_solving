    "problem": "Mr. Patrick is preparing a five-question true-false quiz for his class. He flips a coin before writing the first question. If it is heads, he writes a true statement and if it is tails, he writes a false statement. He continues this until all five statements are written. What is the probability that the correct sequence of answers is TFTFT ? Express your answer as a common fraction.",

    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Since all sequences of 5 answers are equally likely, the probability of any given 5-answer sequence is simply $\\frac{1}{2^5}$, since each answer is equally likely to be true or false. So, the answer evaluates to $\\frac{1}{2^5} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{32}}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n* **Each question has two possibilities:** True (T) or False (F).  \n* **The coin flips are independent:** The outcome of one flip doesn't affect the others.\nSince each question has two possibilities, there are a total of 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 32 possible answer sequences.\nOnly one of these sequences is TFTFT.\nTherefore, the probability of getting the sequence TFTFT is **1/32**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n* **Each question has two possibilities:**  The answer is either true (T) or false (F).\n* **Independent events:** Each coin flip (and therefore each question's truth value) is independent of the others. \n* **Probability of a specific sequence:**  Since each question has a 1/2 chance of being T or F, the probability of getting a specific sequence like TFTFT is: (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/32\n**Therefore, the probability of the correct sequence being TFTFT is 1/32.** \n",
