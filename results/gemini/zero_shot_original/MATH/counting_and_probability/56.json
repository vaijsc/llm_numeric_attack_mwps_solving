    "solution": "Probability questions are sometimes answered by calculating the ways the event will NOT happen, then subtracting.  In this problem the $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$ and $6$ faces are paired to create $5 \\times 5 = 25$ number pairs whose product is NOT multiples of 5.  This leaves $36 - 25 = 11$ ways to get a multiple of $5$, so the probability is $\\boxed{\\frac{11}{36}}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Understanding the Problem**\nWe need to find the probability that the product of the numbers rolled on two dice is a multiple of 5.  This means one or both dice must show a 5.\n**2. Total Possible Outcomes**\n* Each die has 6 sides.\n* With two dice, there are 6 * 6 = 36 possible outcomes.\n**3. Favorable Outcomes**\n* **Case 1: One die shows a 5** \n   * There are 5 ways this can happen (5 on the first die and any number on the second, or any number on the first and 5 on the second).\n* **Case 2: Both dice show a 5**\n   * There is 1 way this can happen.\n**4. Calculate the Probability**\n* There are a total of 5 + 1 = 6 favorable outcomes.\n* The probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes: 6/36 \n**5. Simplify the Answer**\n* The probability simplifies to **1/6**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Basics**\n* **Fair dice:** Each side has an equal chance of landing.\n* **Product:** The result of multiplying two numbers.\n* **Multiple of 5:** A number that can be divided by 5 with no remainder.\n**2. Determine Favorable Outcomes**\nTo get a product that's a multiple of 5, at least one of the dice must show a 5.  Here are the possible combinations:\n* (1, 5)\n* (2, 5)\n* (3, 5)\n* (4, 5)\n* (5, 1)\n* (5, 2)\n* (5, 3)\n* (5, 4)\n* (5, 5)\n* (6, 5)\n* (5, 6)\n**3. Calculate Total Possible Outcomes**\nEach die has 6 sides. Since we're rolling two dice, there are 6 * 6 = 36 possible outcomes.\n**4. Calculate the Probability**\nProbability = (Favorable Outcomes) / (Total Possible Outcomes)\nProbability = 11 / 36\n**Answer:** The probability of the product of the two numbers being a multiple of 5 is **11/36**. \n",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Understand the Basics**\n* **Fair Dice:** Each side of the dice has an equal chance of landing.\n* **Multiples of 5:**  Numbers that are divisible by 5 (5, 10, 15, etc.)\n**2.  Identify Favorable Outcomes**\nTo get a product that's a multiple of 5, at least one of the dice must land on a 5. Let's list the possibilities:\n* **Die 1 = 5:**  We can have any number on Die 2 (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).\n* **Die 2 = 5:** We can have any number on Die 1 (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).\n**3.  Calculate Total Outcomes**\nEach die has 6 sides.  With two dice, there are 6 * 6 = 36 possible outcomes.\n**4.
