    "problem": "A license plate consists of two letters followed by two digits; for example, $MP78$. Neither the digits nor the letters may be repeated, and neither the letter $O$ nor the digit $0$ may be used. When reading from left to right, the letters must be in alphabetical order and the digits must be in increasing order. How many different license plate combinations are possible?",

    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Given any set of two distinct letters (neither of which is O) and two distinct digits (neither of which is 0), we can build exactly one license plate because, whatever the letters and digits, there is only one allowed order.  We can choose two distinct letters (excluding O) in $\\binom{25}{2}$ ways and two distinct digits (excluding 0) in $\\binom{9}{2}$ ways.  Thus the total number of license plates is $\\binom{25}{2}\\binom{9}{2} = \\boxed{10800}$.",

        "Here's how to break down the problem and find the solution:\n**1. Choosing the Letters**\n* We have 24 letters to choose from (A through Z, excluding O).\n* The first letter can be any of these 24.\n* The second letter must be alphabetically greater than the first, so we have 23 choices left. \n**2. Choosing the Digits**\n* We have 9 digits to choose from (1 through 9, excluding 0).\n* The first digit can be any of these 9.\n* The second digit must be greater than the first, so we have 8 choices left.\n**3. Total Combinations**\nTo get the total number of possible license plates, we multiply the number of choices for each step:\n24 choices (for the first letter) * 23 choices (for the second letter) * 9 choices (for the first digit) * 8 choices (for the second digit) = **39,744**\n**Therefore, there are 39,744 different license plate combinations possible.** \n",
