    "problem": "An international meeting is held between England, Germany, and France.  Three representatives attend from England, four from Germany, and two from France.  How many ways can all nine representatives sit around a circular table, if representatives of the same country sit together?  (Two ways are considered the same if one can be rotated to produce the other.)",

    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "To begin, consider the number of ways to arrange the three countries around the circle.  We can consider the English representatives a block, the Germans another block, and the French a third block.  There are $(3-1)!=2$ ways to arrange these three blocks around a circle.  We can also see this by simply drawing the two possible arrangements: [asy]\nlabel(\"E\",(0,0));\nlabel(\"F\",(-.75,-1));\nlabel(\"G\",(.75,-1));\nlabel(\"E\",(3,0));\nlabel(\"F\",(3.75,-1));\nlabel(\"G\",(2.25,-1));\n[/asy] Within the English group, there are $3!=6$ ways to arrange the three representatives.  Similarly, there are $4!$ ways to arrange the Germans and $2!$ ways to arrange the French representatives.  Overall, the total number of ways to seat the 9 representatives is: $$2!\\times3!\\times4!\\times2!=2\\times6\\times24\\times2=\\boxed{576}$$",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Treat each country as a unit:**\nSince representatives from the same country must sit together, we can initially treat each country as a single unit.  We have 3 units (England, Germany, France) to arrange.\n**2. Arrange the units:**\nThere are (3-1)! = 2! = 2 ways to arrange these units in a circle.  (Remember, with circular arrangements, we fix one position to avoid overcounting rotations).\n**3. Arrange representatives within each country:**\n* **England:** 3! = 6 ways to arrange the 3 English representatives.\n* **Germany:** 4! = 24 ways to arrange the 4 German representatives.\n* **France:** 2! = 2 ways to arrange the 2 French representatives.\n**4. Combine the arrangements:**\nTo get the total number of arrangements, we multiply the possibilities at each step:\n2 ways (for arranging the countries) * 6 ways (for arranging English reps) * 24 ways (for arranging German reps) * 2 ways (for arranging French reps) = **576**\n**Therefore, there are 576 ways to arrange the representatives around the table, with representatives from the same country sitting together.** \n",
