    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "In this problem, we're really selecting two separate committees.  We can choose 3 men from the 30 men total in $$ \\binom{30}{3} = \\frac{30 \\times 29 \\times 28}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 4,\\!060 $$ways, and 4 women from the 40 women total in $$ \\binom{40}{4} = \\frac{40 \\times 39 \\times 38 \\times 37}{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 91,\\!390 $$ways.  Since these two selections are independent (since for each of the $4,\\!060$ ways to pick the men, there are $91,\\!390$ ways to pick the women), we multiply them together to get the number of ways that we can form the 7-member overall committee: $$ \\binom{30}{3}\\binom{40}{4} = (4,\\!060)(91,\\!390) = \\boxed{371,\\!043,\\!400}. $$",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Choosing the Men:**\n* We need to choose 3 men from a group of 30. \n* This is a combination problem (order doesn't matter), and we use the formula:  \n   *  \u00b3\u2070C\u2083 = (30!)/(3! * 27!) = 4060\n**2. Choosing the Women:**\n* We need to choose 4 women from a group of 40. \n*  \u2074\u2070C\u2084 = (40!)/(4! * 36!) = 91,390\n**3. Combining the Choices:**\n* For each way we choose the men, there are 91,390 ways to choose the women. \n* To find the total number of ways to form the committee, we multiply the possibilities: \n   * 4060 * 91,390 = **370,983,400**\n**Therefore, there are 370,983,400 ways to form the 7-person steering committee.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Choosing the Men:**\n* We need to choose 3 men out of 30.  This is a combination problem, as the order we choose them in doesn't matter.\n* The number of ways to choose 3 men from 30 is:  \u00b3\u2070C\u2083 = (30!)/(3! * 27!) = 4060\n**2.

Combining the Choices:**\n* For every possible group of 3 men, we can pair any of the possible groups of 4 women.  \n* To find the total number of committees, we multiply the number of ways to choose men by the number of ways to choose women: 4060 * 91,390 = **370,659,400**\n**Therefore, there are 370,659,400 ways to form the 7-person steering committee.** \n",
