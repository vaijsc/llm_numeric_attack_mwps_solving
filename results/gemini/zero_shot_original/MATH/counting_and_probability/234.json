    "problem": "Suppose that I have 6 different books, 2 of which are math books.  In how many ways can I stack my 6 books on a shelf if I want a math book on both ends of the stack?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "We first place the math books.  We have two choices for the bottom book, and then the only one remaining choice for the top book which is the other math book.  Then we place the four other books in the middle.  There are 4 choices for the first book, 3 choices for the second, 2 choices for the third, and only 1 choice for the fourth.  So the total number of ways the books can be placed is $2 \\times 1 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = \\boxed{48}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n1. **Choose the math books for the ends:** You have 2 choices for the math book on the left end and 1 choice left for the math book on the right end. This gives us 2 * 1 = 2 possibilities.\n2. **Arrange the remaining books:**  You have 4 books left to arrange in the middle.  There are 4 choices for the first book, 3 choices for the second, and so on.  This gives us 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24 ways to arrange the remaining books.\n3. **Combine the possibilities:** To get the total number of ways to stack the books, we multiply the number of possibilities for each step: 2 * 24 = **48 ways**. \n",

(4 factorial) ways, which is 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24 ways.\n3. **Combine the arrangements:**  Since the choices for the end books and the choices for the middle books are independent, we multiply the possibilities together: 2 ways (for ends) * 24 ways (for middle) = 48 ways.\n**Therefore, there are 48 ways to stack the books with a math book on each end.** \n",
