    "solution": "A 5-digit number can have for its leftmost digit anything from 1 to 9 inclusive, and for each of its next four digits anything from 0 through 9 inclusive. Thus there are $9\\times 10\\times 10\\times 10\\times 10=90,\\!000$ 5-digit numbers.\n\nA 5-digit number with no 2 or 3 as a digit can have for its first digit 1 or anything from 4 through 9, and can have for each other digit any of those numbers or 0.\n\nThere are $7 \\times 8\\times 8\\times 8\\times 8=28,\\!672$ such 5-digit numbers. Therefore the number of 5-digit numbers with at least one 2 or one 3 as a digit is  $90,\\!000-28,\\!672=\\boxed{61,328}.$",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Total 5-digit numbers:**\n* The first digit can be anything from 1 to 9 (9 choices).\n* The remaining four digits can be anything from 0 to 9 (10 choices each).\n* Total 5-digit numbers: 9 * 10 * 10 * 10 * 10 = 90,000\n**2. 5-digit numbers with NO 2s or 3s:**\n* The first digit can be anything from 1 to 9 except 2 or 3 (7 choices).\n* The remaining four digits can be anything from 0 to 9 except 2 or 3 (8 choices each).\n* Total 5-digit numbers with no 2s or 3s: 7 * 8 * 8 * 8 * 8 = 28,672\n**3. 5-digit numbers with at least one 2 or 3:**\n* Subtract the numbers with no 2s or 3s from the total number of 5-digit numbers.\n* 90,000 - 28,672 = **61,328**\n**Therefore, there are 61,328 five-digit numbers that have at least one 2 or one 3 among their digits.** \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem:\n**1. Total 5-digit numbers:**\n* The first digit can be anything from 1 to 9 (since it can't be 0).\n* The remaining four digits can be any of the 10 digits (0-9).\nSo, the total number of 5-digit numbers is 9 * 10 * 10 * 10 * 10 = 90,000.\n**2. Numbers with NO 2s or 3s:**\n* The first digit can be any of the 7 digits (1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).\n* The remaining four digits can be any of the 8 digits (0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).\nSo, the number of 5-digit numbers with no 2s or 3s is 7 * 8 * 8 * 8 * 8 = 28,672.\n**3. Numbers with at least one 2 or 3:**\nTo find the number of 5-digit numbers with at least one 2 or 3, we subtract the numbers with no 2s or 3s from the total number of 5-digit numbers.\nTherefore, the answer is 90,000 - 28,672 = **61,328**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Find the total number of 5-digit numbers:**\n* The first digit can be anything from 1 to 9 (since it can't be 0).\n* The remaining four digits can be any of the ten digits (0-9).\n* So, there are 9 * 10 * 10 * 10 * 10 = 90,000 possible 5-digit numbers.\n**2. Find the number of 5-digit numbers with *no* 2s or 3s:**\n* The first digit has 7 choices (1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).\n* Each of the remaining four digits has 8 choices (0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).\n* So, there are 7 * 8 * 8 * 8 * 8 = 28,672 5-digit numbers with no 2s or 3s.\n**3. Subtract to find the answer:**\n* The number of 5-digit numbers with at least one 2 or one 3 is the total number of 5-digit numbers minus the number of 5-digit numbers with no 2s or 3s.\n* 90,000 - 28,672 = **61,328**\n**Therefore, there are 61,328 5-digit numbers that have at least one 2 or one 3 among their digits.** \n",
