    "solution": "The number of ways to choose one white ball and one black ball is $5k$, since there are 5 choices for the white ball and $k$ choices for the black ball.  The number of ways to pick any 2 balls out of $(k+5)$ balls is $\\dbinom{k+5}{2}=\\dfrac{(k+5)(k+4)}{2}$.  So we have to solve for $k$ in the equation \\[\\frac{5k}{\\frac{(k+5)(k+4)}{2}}=\\frac{10}{21}.\\]After clearing the denominators, we can simplify to $210k = 10(k+5)(k+4)$, giving the quadratic $10k^2 - 120k + 200 = 0$.  This is the same as $k^2 - 12k + 20 = 0$, which factors as $(k-2)(k-10)=0$, so its solutions are $k={2}$ or $k={10}$. Since the problem is asking for the smallest value, $\\boxed{2}$ is the correct answer.",

Set up the Probability Equation**\nThe probability of drawing one white ball and one black ball can happen in two ways:\n* **Case 1:** White ball then black ball\n* **Case 2:** Black ball then white ball\nWe need to consider both cases and add their probabilities:\n*  P(White then Black) = P(A) * P(B | A)  \n*  P(Black then White) = P(B) * P(A | B)\nTherefore, the total probability is:\nP(One white, One black) = P(A) * P(B | A) + P(B) * P(A | B) = 10/21\n**3. Calculate Individual Probabilities**\n* **P(A):** Probability of drawing a white ball on the first draw. This is the number of white balls divided by the total number of balls: 5 / (5 + k)\n* **P(B):** Probability of drawing a black ball on the first draw: k / (5 + k)\n* **P(B | A):** Probability of drawing a black ball on the second draw given that a white ball was drawn first. This is the number of black balls remaining divided by the total number of balls remaining: k / (4 + k)\n* **P(A | B):** Probability of drawing a white ball on the second draw given that a black ball was drawn first: 5 / (4 + k)\n**4. Substitute into the Equation**\nNow substitute these probabilities back into our equation:\n(5 / (5 + k)) * (k / (4 + k)) + (k / (5 + k)) * (5 / (4 + k)) = 10/21\n**5. Simplify and Solve**\nSimplify the equation:\n* (5k + 5k) / ((5 + k)(4 + k)) = 10/21\n* 10k / ((5 + k)(4 + k)) = 10/21\nCross-multiply and solve for k:\n* 210k = 10(5 + k)(4 + k)\n* 21k = (5 + k)(4 + k)\n* 21k = 20 + 9k + k^2\n* k^2 - 12k + 20 = 0\n* (k - 10)(k - 2) = 0\nThis gives us two possible solutions: k = 10 or k = 2.\n**6.
