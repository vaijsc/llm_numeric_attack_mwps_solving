    "solution": "The probability of rolling 1 or 6 is $\\frac{2}{6}$, and the probability of flipping heads is $\\frac{1}{2}$.  Therefore, the probability that the game will end on the first turn is $\\frac{2}{6}\\cdot \\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{1}{6}$.  The probability that the game will not end on the first turn is $1-\\frac{1}{6}=\\frac{5}{6}$.  Given that the game is still going after 1 turn, the probability that the game will not end on the second turn is also $\\frac{5}{6}$.  Therefore, the probability that the game does not end by the end of the second turn is $\\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^2$.  Similarly, the probability that the game is still going after 3 turns is $\\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^3=\\frac{125}{216}$.  So the probability that the game is over by the end of the third turn is $1-\\dfrac{125}{216}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{91}{216}}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Probability of Winning in a Single Turn**\n* The probability of rolling a 1 or a 6 is 2/6 = 1/3.\n* The probability of getting heads is 1/2.\n* To win in a single turn, both events must occur, so the probability is (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.\n**2. Probability of Losing in a Single Turn**\n* The probability of losing in a single turn is the complement of winning, which is 1 - (1/6) = 5/6.\n**3. Probability of Losing the First Three Turns**\n* To lose the first three turns, you must lose on each individual turn. \n* This probability is (5/6) * (5/6) * (5/6) = 125/216.\n**4. Probability of Winning Before the Fourth Turn**\n* The probability of winning before the fourth turn is the opposite of losing the first three turns.\n* Therefore, the probability of winning before the fourth turn is 1 - (125/216) = **91/216**. \n",
