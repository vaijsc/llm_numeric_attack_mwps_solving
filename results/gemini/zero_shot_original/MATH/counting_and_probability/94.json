        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Count the Squares**\n* **1x1 squares:** There are a total of 3 * n = 3n of these.\n* **2x2 squares:**  There are (3-1)(n-1) = 2(n-1) of these. \n* **3x3 squares:** There are (3-2)(n-2) = (n-2) of these.\n**2. Set Up the Equation**\nThe total number of squares is the sum of the squares of each size: \n3n + 2(n-1) + (n-2) = 70\n**3. Solve for n**\n* Simplify the equation: 3n + 2n - 2 + n - 2 = 70\n* Combine like terms: 6n - 4 = 70\n* Add 4 to both sides: 6n = 74\n* Divide both sides by 6: n = 74/6\n* Simplify: n = **37/3**\n**Therefore, the value of n is 37/3.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Count the Squares**\n* **1x1 squares:** There are $3n$ of these, one for each dot in the grid.\n* **2x2 squares:**  We can think of these as shifting a 2x2 box across the grid.  There are $(n-1)$ horizontal positions for this box, and 2 vertical positions, giving us $2(n-1)$ squares.\n* **3x3 squares:** We can shift a 3x3 box across the grid. There are $(n-2)$ horizontal positions for this box, and 1 vertical position, giving us $(n-2)$ squares.\n**2. Set Up the Equation**\nThe total number of squares is 70, so we have the equation:\n3n + 2(n-1) + (n-2) = 70\n**3. Solve for n**\nSimplify and solve the equation:\n3n + 2n - 2 + n - 2 = 70\n6n - 4 = 70\n6n = 74\nn = **12.33**\nSince we're dealing with a grid of whole numbers, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. \n**Answer:** The value of *n* is **13**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Count the Smallest Squares**\n* The smallest squares are 1 by 1.  There's one of these for every point in the grid.  Since the grid has 3 rows and *n* columns, there are 3*n smallest squares.\n**2. Count the Medium Squares**\n* The medium squares are 2 by 2.  Think about how many of these fit across the grid.  You can fit *n-1* of them horizontally.  You can also fit *2* of them vertically.  This gives us (n-1)*2 = 2n-2 medium squares.\n**3. Count the Largest Squares**\n* The largest squares are 3 by 3.  There's only one of these, since it covers the entire grid.\n**4. Set Up the Equation**\n* We know the total number of squares is 70. So, we have the equation: \n   3*n + 2n - 2 + 1 = 70\n**5. Solve for n**\n* Combine like terms: 5n - 1 = 70\n* Add 1 to both sides: 5n = 71\n* Divide both sides by 5: n = 14.2 \n**6. Final Answer**\n* Since *n* represents the number of columns, it must be a whole number.  Therefore, there must be an error in the problem statement. There is no integer value of *n* that results in exactly 70 squares. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Count the Squares by Size**\n* **1x1 Squares:**  There are  (n+1)(3+1) = 4n + 4  of these. (Think of each grid point as the bottom left corner of a possible 1x1 square)\n* **2x2 Squares:** There are (n)(2) = 2n of these. (Think of the top left corner of a 2x2 square being able to move across the grid, but leaving room for the whole square).\n* **3x3 Squares:** There are (n-1)(1) = n-1 of these. (Similar logic to the 2x2 squares).\n**2. Set Up the Equation**\nWe know the total number of squares is 70, so we can write the equation:\n(4n + 4) + 2n + (n - 1) = 70\n**3. Solve for 'n'**\nSimplify and solve the equation:\n* 7n + 3 = 70\n* 7n = 67\n* n = 67/7\nSince 'n' must be a whole number, this solution is not valid. Let's go back and check if we missed any squares.\n**4. Revisiting the Count**\nNotice that when counting the 1x1 squares, we included squares that are actually part of larger squares.  We need to adjust our count.\n* **1x1 Squares:**  We need to subtract the number of squares that are contained within the larger squares. There are 2n + (n-1) = 3n - 1 squares that are part of larger squares.  So, the actual number of 1x1 squares is (4n + 4) - (3n - 1) = n + 5\n**5.  New Equation**\nOur new equation is:\n(n + 5) + 2n + (n - 1) = 70\n**6. Solve for 'n'**\n* 4n + 4 = 70\n* 4n = 66\n* n = 16.5\nAgain, 'n' needs to be a whole number. We've made a mistake somewhere.\n**7. The Missing Squares**\nWe've been neglecting the **3x1 squares!** There are 3 of these, one for each row of the grid. \n**8. Final Equation**\nOur final equation is:\n(n + 5) + 2n + (n - 1) + 3 = 70\n**9. Final Solution**\n* 4n + 7 = 70\n* 4n = 63\n* n = 15.75\nSince 'n' needs to be a whole number, the answer is **n = 15**. \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem:\n**1. Count the Squares**\n* **1x1 squares:** There are  (3-1)(n-1) = 2(n-1)  1x1 squares.  (Think of the grid as having one less row and column than the number of points).\n* **2x2 squares:** There are (3-2)(n-2) = (n-2) 2x2 squares. \n* **3x3 squares:** There are (3-3)(n-3) = 0 3x3 squares.\n**2. Set Up the Equation**\nThe total number of squares is 70, so:\n2(n-1) + (n-2) + 0 = 70\n**3. Solve for n**\nSimplify and solve the equation:\n2n - 2 + n - 2 = 70\n3n - 4 = 70\n3n = 74\nn = 74/3\n**4.  Final Step**\nSince *n* must be a whole number (representing the number of points in a row), we know there's no solution where the total number of squares is exactly 70.  There must be an error in the problem statement. \n"
