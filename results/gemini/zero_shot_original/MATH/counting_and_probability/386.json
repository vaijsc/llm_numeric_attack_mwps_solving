    "problem": "In how many ways can we seat 8 people around a table if Alice and Bob won't sit next to each other?  (Two seatings are the same if one is a rotation of the other.)",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are 8 choices for seats for Alice to sit in.  Once Alice is seated, there are 5 seats left for Bob, since he won't sit in either seat immediately next to Alice.  This leaves 6 people to place in the remaining 6 seats, which can be done in $6!$ ways.  However, we must divide by 8 to account for the 8 rotations of the table.  So the number of arrangements is $\\dfrac{8 \\times 5 \\times 6!}{8} = 5 \\times 6! = \\boxed{3600}$. Alternatively, we can account for the rotations at the beginning, by fixing the table around Alice.  Bob can't sit in her seat, or the two seats next to her.  This leaves 5 places for him to sit.  Then, this leaves 6 unique seats for the 6 remaining people, so there are 6! ways to sit them after Bob is sitting.  So the answer is $5 \\times 6! = \\boxed{3600}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Total unrestricted arrangements:**\n* If there were no restrictions, we could seat the 8 people in (8-1)! = 7! = 5040 ways.  We subtract 1 because rotations of the same arrangement are considered the same.\n**2. Arrangements where Alice and Bob *do* sit together:**\n* Treat Alice and Bob as a single unit. Now we have 7 \"units\" to arrange (6 individual people + the Alice-Bob unit): (7-1)! = 6! = 720 ways.\n* Within the Alice-Bob unit, they can switch positions, giving us 2! = 2 ways.\n* So, there are 720 * 2 = 1440 arrangements where Alice and Bob sit together.\n**3. Arrangements where Alice and Bob *don't* sit together:**\n* Subtract the arrangements where they sit together from the total unrestricted arrangements: 5040 - 1440 = 3600 ways.\n**Therefore, there are 3600 ways to seat 8 people around a table where Alice and Bob don't sit next to each other.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Total Arrangements without Restrictions**\n* If there were no restrictions, we could arrange 8 people in a circle in (8-1)! = 7! = 5040 ways.  (Remember that rotations are considered the same arrangement, so we divide by 8 to account for this).\n**2.  Arrangements Where Alice and Bob Sit Together**\n* Treat Alice and Bob as a single unit. Now we have 7 units to arrange (6 individuals + the Alice/Bob unit).  \n* These 7 units can be arranged in (7-1)! = 6! = 720 ways.\n* Within the Alice/Bob unit, they can switch places (Alice-Bob or Bob-Alice), giving us 2 possibilities for each arrangement.\n* So, the total number of arrangements where Alice and Bob sit together is 720 * 2 = 1440\n**3.  Arrangements Where Alice and Bob Don't Sit Together**\n* To find the number of arrangements where Alice and Bob *don't* sit together, subtract the number of arrangements where they *do* sit together from the total number of arrangements. \n* This gives us 5040 - 1440 = **3600**\n**Therefore, there are 3600 ways to seat 8 people around a table so that Alice and Bob don't sit next to each other.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Total Arrangements Without Restrictions**\n* If there were no restrictions, we could arrange 8 people in a circle in (8-1)! = 7! = 5040 ways.  (Remember, circular permutations have one fewer arrangement than linear permutations).\n**2. Arrangements Where Alice and Bob Sit Together**\n* Treat Alice and Bob as a single unit. Now we have 7 units to arrange (6 individuals + the Alice-Bob unit). This can be done in 6! = 720 ways.\n*  Since Alice and Bob can switch places within their unit, we multiply by 2 to account for this.  So, there are 720 * 2 = 1440 arrangements where Alice and Bob sit together.\n**3. Arrangements Where Alice and Bob Don't Sit Together**\n* To find the number of arrangements where Alice and Bob *don't* sit together, subtract the arrangements where they *do* sit together from the total number of arrangements:\n    5040 (total arrangements) - 1440 (arrangements with Alice and Bob together) = 3600\n**Therefore, there are 3600 ways to seat 8 people around a table where Alice and Bob don't sit next to each other.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Total Possible Arrangements**\n* If there were no restrictions, we could arrange 8 people in a circle in (8-1)! = 7! ways.

Now we have 7 \"units\" to arrange (6 individuals plus the Alice-Bob pair), which can be done in (7-1)! = 6! ways.\n* Within the Alice-Bob unit, they can swap places (2! ways).\n**3. Arrangements Where Alice and Bob Don't Sit Together**\n* Subtract the arrangements where they *do* sit together from the total arrangements:\n   Total arrangements - arrangements where Alice and Bob sit together = arrangements where Alice and Bob don't sit together.\n* This gives us:  7! - (6! * 2!) \n**4.
