    "solution": "We first think of the German delegates forming a single German block, denoted G, the French delegates forming a single French block F, and the Italian delegates forming a single Italian block I.  Then there are $3! = 6$ ways to arrange the three blocks in a row: $$ \\text{\\textbf{\\large FGI, FIG, GFI, GIF, IFG, IGF.}} $$ Within each block, there are $6!$ ways to arrange the German delegates, $5!$ ways to arrange the French delegates, and $3!$ ways to arrange the Italian delegates.  Therefore, there are $$ 3! \\times 6! \\times 5! \\times 3! = 6 \\times 720 \\times 120 \\times 6 = \\boxed{3,\\!110,\\!400} $$ ways to seat all 14 delegates.",

        "Here's how to solve this step-by-step:\n**1. Treat each country as a unit:**\n* Imagine the German delegates as one unit (G), the French as another (F), and the Italians as another (I).  \n* We now have 3 units to arrange.\n**2. Arrange the units:**\n* These 3 units can be arranged in 3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6 ways. \n**3. Arrange delegates within each unit:**\n* Within the German unit (G), the 6 delegates can be arranged in 6! = 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720 ways.\n* Within the French unit (F), the 5 delegates can be arranged in 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120 ways.\n* Within the Italian unit (I), the 3 delegates can be arranged in 3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6 ways.\n**4.  Multiply to find the total arrangements:**\n* To get the total number of arrangements, multiply the number of ways to arrange the units by the number of ways to arrange delegates within each unit: 6 * 720 * 120 * 6 = **3,110,400**\n**Therefore, there are 3,110,400 ways to arrange the delegates if each country's delegates must sit together.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Treat each country as a unit:**\n* Imagine the German delegates as one unit, the French delegates as another unit, and the Italian delegates as a third unit.  \n* We now have 3 units to arrange.\n**2. Arrange the units:**\n* These 3 units can be arranged in 3! (3 factorial) ways, which is 3 * 2 * 1 = 6 ways.\n**3. Arrange delegates within each unit:**\n* The 6 German delegates can be arranged within their unit in 6! ways (6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720 ways).\n* The 5 French delegates can be arranged within their unit in 5! ways (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120 ways).\n* The 3 Italian delegates can be arranged within their unit in 3! ways (3 * 2 * 1 = 6 ways).\n**4. Multiply to find the total arrangements:**\n* To find the total number of arrangements, we multiply the possibilities for each step: 6 * 720 * 120 * 6 = **3,110,400**\n**Therefore, there are 3,110,400 ways to arrange the delegates if they must sit together by nationality.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step by step:\n**1. Treat each country as a unit:**\n* Imagine the German delegates as one unit, the French delegates as another unit, and the Italian delegates as a third unit.  \n* Now we have 3 units to arrange.\n**2. Arrange the units:**\n* There are 3! (3 factorial) ways to arrange these 3 units.  3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6 ways.\n**3. Arrange within each unit:**\n* Within the German unit, there are 6! ways to arrange the 6 delegates.\n* Within the French unit, there are 5! ways to arrange the 5 delegates.\n* Within the Italian unit, there are 3! ways to arrange the 3 delegates.\n**4. Multiply the possibilities:**\n* To get the total number of arrangements, we multiply the number of ways to arrange the units by the number of ways to arrange within each unit.\n**Therefore, the total number of arrangements is:**\n6! * 5! * 3! * 3!  = 720 * 120 * 6 * 6 = **31,104,000** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Treat each group as a unit:**\n* Since the delegates from each country must sit together, consider the German group as one unit, the French group as another unit, and the Italian group as a third unit.\n**2. Arrange the units:**\n* We now have 3 units (German, French, Italian) to arrange in a row. There are 3! = 6 ways to arrange these units.\n**3. Arrange delegates within each unit:**\n* **German:** The 6 German delegates can be arranged within their unit in 6! = 720 ways.\n* **French:** The 5 French delegates can be arranged within their unit in 5! = 120 ways.\n* **Italian:** The 3 Italian delegates can be arranged within their unit in 3! = 6 ways.\n**4. Combine the arrangements:**\n* To get the total number of arrangements, multiply the number of ways to arrange the units by the number of ways to arrange the delegates within each unit:\n    6 ways (for units) * 720 ways (for Germans) * 120 ways (for French) * 6 ways (for Italians) = **3,110,400 ways**\n**Therefore, there are 3,110,400 ways to arrange the delegates if they must sit together by nationality.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step by step:\n**1. Treat each country as a unit:**\n* Instead of 14 individual delegates, think of 3 units: German group (6 delegates), French group (5 delegates), and Italian group (3 delegates). \n**2. Arrange the units:**\n* We have 3 units to arrange, so there are 3! = 6 ways to arrange them.\n**3. Arrange delegates within each unit:**\n* **German:** 6 delegates can be arranged within their group in 6! = 720 ways.\n* **French:** 5 delegates can be arranged within their group in 5! = 120 ways.\n* **Italian:** 3 delegates can be arranged within their group in 3! = 6 ways.\n**4. Combine the arrangements:**\nTo get the total number of arrangements, multiply the number of ways to arrange the units by the number of ways to arrange delegates within each unit:\nTotal arrangements = (Ways to arrange units) * (Ways to arrange Germans) * (Ways to arrange French) * (Ways to arrange Italians)\nTotal arrangements = 6 * 720 * 120 * 6 = **31,104,000**\n**Therefore, there are 31,104,000 ways to arrange the delegates if each country's delegates must sit together.** \n"
