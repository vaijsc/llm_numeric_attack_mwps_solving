    "solution": "First choose a seat for Alice. It doesn't matter what seat we choose because we can rotate the table to move Alice's seat to wherever we want. After Alice's seat has been chosen, there are five seats Bob is willing to sit in. Of these seats, 2 are two seats away from Alice, and 3 are not. If Bob sits in either of the locations two seats away from Alice, there will be 3 places left Eve is willing to sit. If he sits in one of the other seats, there will be 2 places left Eve is willing to sit. Once Alice, Bob, and Eve's seats have been chosen, the remaining people can be placed in $5!$ ways. Therefore, the total number of ways for the 8 people to sit around the table is $2\\cdot3\\cdot5!+3\\cdot2\\cdot5!=\\boxed{1440}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Fix a Position**\nSince rotations are considered the same, we can fix one person's position to avoid overcounting. Let's fix Alice's position.\n**2.  Consider the Restricted Group**\nBob and Eve cannot sit next to Alice.  We'll treat them as a \"restricted group.\" \n**3. Arrange the Restricted Group**\n* We have 5 remaining spots for Bob and Eve.  \n* Think of Bob and Eve as a unit. This unit can be placed in 5 different spots.\n* Within this unit, Bob and Eve can switch places (2 ways).\n**4. Arrange the Remaining People**\n* We have 5 remaining people to place in the 5 remaining spots. This can be done in 5! = 120 ways.\n**5. Total Arrangements**\nTo get the total number of arrangements where Alice, Bob, and Eve are not together, multiply the possibilities from each step:\n5 spots for the unit * 2 ways to arrange the unit * 5! ways to arrange the rest = 5 * 2 * 120 = **1200**\n**Therefore, there are 1200 ways to arrange the 8 people around the circular table so that Alice, Bob, and Eve don't sit next to each other.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Fix a Position**\n* Since we're dealing with a circular table, rotations are considered the same. To avoid overcounting, let's fix one person's position.  We'll arbitrarily choose Alice. \n**2.  Place the Rest**\n* **Consider Bob:** Bob cannot sit next to Alice. There are 5 remaining positions where Bob can sit (leaving two seats empty on either side of Alice).\n* **Consider Eve:** Eve also cannot sit next to Alice or Bob. There are now 4 remaining positions for Eve.\n**3.  Arrange the Remaining People**\n* The remaining 5 people can be arranged in the 5 remaining seats in 5! (5 factorial) ways.\n**4.  Account for Overcounting**\n* We've fixed Alice's position, but initially, we could have chosen any of the 8 people to fix. So, we've overcounted by a factor of 8. \n**5.  Calculate the Total Arrangements**\n* The total number of arrangements where Alice, Bob, and Eve are not adjacent is:\n  (5 positions for Bob) * (4 positions for Eve) * (5! arrangements of the rest) / 8 (to correct for overcounting) \n* This simplifies to: 5 * 4 * 120 / 8 = **300**\n**Therefore, there are 300 ways to arrange the 8 people around the table so that Alice, Bob, and Eve don't sit next to each other.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step by step:\n**1.  Fix a Position**\n* Since rotations are considered the same, we can fix one person's position without loss of generality.  Let's say we fix Alice's position.\n**2.  Consider the Forbidden Seats**\n*  Alice has two seats next to her that are off-limits to Bob and Eve. \n**3.  Place Bob**\n* There are 5 remaining seats for Bob.  He can't be next to Alice, so he has 5 options.\n**4.  Place Eve**\n* Now, Bob has two seats next to him that are off-limits to Eve. This leaves 3 possible seats for Eve.\n**5.  Place the Rest**\n* The remaining 5 people can be arranged in the remaining 5 seats in 5! = 120 ways.\n**6.  Account for Overcounting**\n* We've overcounted because we initially fixed Alice's position.  Since we are dealing with a circular table, there are actually 8 positions Alice could have occupied. \n**7.  Calculate the Final Answer**\nThe total number of valid arrangements is:\n(5 * 3 * 5!)/8 = (15 * 120) / 8 = **225**\n**Therefore, there are 225 ways for 8 people to sit around a circular table if Alice, Bob, and Eve don't want to sit next to each other.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Fix a Position**\nSince rotations are considered the same, let's fix Alice's position. This doesn't affect the number of possibilities because we can rotate the table to put anyone in a fixed spot.\n**2.  Consider the Restrictions**\n* Bob and Eve cannot sit next to Alice. \n* Bob and Eve cannot sit next to each other.\n**3.  Place Bob and Eve**\n* There are 5 empty seats that Bob can sit in (he can't sit next to Alice). \n* Once Bob is placed, Eve has only 3 options left (she can't sit next to Alice or Bob).\n**4.  Place the Remaining People**\n* We've placed 3 people, leaving 5 remaining. \n* These 5 people can be arranged in 5! (5 factorial) ways, which is 5*4*3*2*1 = 120.\n**5.  Total Possibilities**\nTo get the total number of arrangements where Alice, Bob, and Eve are not seated next to each other, multiply the possibilities for each step:\n5 (options for Bob) * 3 (options for Eve) * 120 (options for the remaining people) = **1800**\n**Therefore, there are 1800 ways to seat the 8 people around the table where Alice, Bob, and Eve are not seated next to each other.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Fix a Position:**\n* Since we're dealing with a circular table, rotations are considered the same. To avoid overcounting, let's fix the position of one person.  Let's arbitrarily choose Alice to sit in a specific chair.\n**2.  Consider the Restrictions:**\n*  Bob and Eve cannot sit next to Alice.\n**3.  Place Bob and Eve:**\n*  We now have 7 remaining spots. Let's think about placing Bob first. \n*  Bob can't sit in either of the two spots next to Alice, leaving him 5 possible positions. \n*  Eve now has to avoid both Alice and Bob. Since Bob is already placed, Eve has 4 possible positions left.\n**4.  Place the Remaining People:**\n* The remaining 5 people can be arranged in the remaining 5 spots in 5! (5 factorial) ways.\n**5.  Calculate the Total Arrangements:**\n*  The total number of ways to arrange the 8 people with the restriction is: 5 (for Bob's position) * 4 (for Eve's position) * 5! (for the rest) = 5 * 4 * 120 = 2400\n**6.  Divide for Circular Arrangements:**\n*  Since we fixed Alice's position to avoid overcounting rotations, we need to divide by the number of positions Alice could have been in, which is 8.\n**Final Answer:**\nThere are 2400 / 8 = **300** ways to arrange the 8 people around the table with the given restriction. \n"
