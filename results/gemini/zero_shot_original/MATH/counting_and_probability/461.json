Dividing Days by Weeks:** 365 days / 7 days/week = 52 weeks with 1 day left over.\n**4. Extra Day:**  The extra day means that 2007 has 52 full weeks and one extra day. Since January 1, 2007, was a Monday, the extra day is a Tuesday.\n**5. Number of Fridays:** Since there are 52 full weeks in the year, there are **52 Fridays** in 2007. \n",

        "Here's how to figure out how many Fridays are in 2007:\n**1. Days in a Year:**  There are 365 days in a regular year like 2007.\n**2. Days in a Week:** There are 7 days in a week.\n**3. Number of Weeks:** Divide the days in a year by the days in a week: 365 days / 7 days/week = 52 weeks (with a remainder of 1 day).\n**4. The Remainder:** The remainder of 1 day means that 2007 has one extra day beyond the 52 full weeks. Since January 1st, 2007 was a Monday, that extra day means December 31st, 2007 was a Tuesday.\n**5. Fridays in a Year:** In a full year, there are 52 Fridays. Since 2007 has one extra day, there will still be **52 Fridays** in 2007. \n",
