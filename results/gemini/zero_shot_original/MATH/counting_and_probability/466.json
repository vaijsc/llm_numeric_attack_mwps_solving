    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "If each person shakes hands with exactly one other person, then there will be $\\frac{23 \\cdot 1}{2}$ handshakes, since two people are required to complete a handshake. This is equal to 11.5 handshakes, which is clearly impossible. We can achieve 12 handshakes by forming two rows of 11 and 12 people. Each person in the first row shakes hands a different person in the second row. This will give eleven handshakes. The leftover person must shake hands with someone, giving $\\boxed{12}$ handshakes total.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  The Minimum Scenario:**\n* Imagine the people at the party form a line. \n* The first person shakes hands with the second person. \n* The second person shakes hands with the third person.\n* This continues down the line.\n**2.  Calculating the Minimum:**\n* In this scenario, each person except the last one shakes hands with exactly one other person.\n* Since there are 23 people, there are **22** handshakes in this minimum scenario.\n**Therefore, the minimum possible number of handshakes is 22.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding the Problem**\nWe need to find the fewest possible handshakes if each of the 23 people shakes hands with at least one other person.\n**Step-by-Step Solution**\n1. **Minimum Connections:** Imagine the people are in a line. The first person shakes hands with the second person. The second person already shook hands with the first, so they only need to shake hands with the third person. This pattern continues down the line.\n2. **Visualizing:**\n   * Person 1 shakes hands with Person 2.\n   * Person 2 shakes hands with Person 3.\n   * Person 3 shakes hands with Person 4.\n   * ... and so on.\n3. **Calculation:**  Since each person shakes hands with only the next person in line, to get the minimum number of handshakes, we need one less handshake than the number of people. \n4. **Result:**  Therefore, the minimum number of handshakes is 23 - 1 = **22**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n* We have 23 people at a party.\n* Everyone shakes hands with at least one other person.\n* We need to find the *minimum* number of handshakes that could occur.\n**Finding the Minimum:**\n* **Scenario 1:** Imagine everyone shakes hands with only *one* other person.  \n    * If we pair up the people, we have 23/2 = 11.5 pairs. Since we can't have half a pair, we know we have 11 pairs, with one person left out. \n    * This would mean 11 handshakes.\n* **Scenario 2:** The person who was left out could then shake hands with *any* of the 22 other people. \n    * This adds one more handshake to our total.\n**The Answer:**\nThe minimum possible number of handshakes is 11 + 1 = **12**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding the Problem**\n* We need to find the *minimum* number of handshakes. This means we want to find the scenario where the fewest handshakes occur.\n**The Key Insight**\n* To minimize handshakes, we want to group people together so that they shake hands only with members of their group.\n**Solution**\n1. **Divide and Conquer:** Imagine the 23 people are divided into two groups: one group with 11 people and another group with 12 people.\n2. **Internal Handshakes:**  Each person in the group of 11 shakes hands with the other 10 people in their group.  Similarly, each person in the group of 12 shakes hands with the other 11 people in their group.\n3. **Minimum Handshakes:**  Therefore, the minimum number of handshakes is:\n   * Group 1: 11 * 10 = 110 handshakes\n   * Group 2: 12 * 11 = 132 handshakes\n   * **Total:** 110 + 132 = **242 handshakes**\n**Important Note:** This solution assumes that people only shake hands with others within their group. If even one person shakes hands with someone in the other group, the total number of handshakes would increase. \n",
