        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the perfect cubes within the range:**\n* The smallest perfect cube greater than 25 is 27 (3 cubed).\n* The largest perfect cube less than 250 is 216 (6 cubed).\n**2. Determine the number of perfect cubes:**\n* The perfect cubes within the range are 27, 64, 125, and 216. There are **4** perfect cubes.\n**3. Calculate the total number of integers:**\n* The list contains 250 - 25 + 1 = **226** integers.\n**4. Subtract the perfect cubes:**\n* The number of integers that are *not* perfect cubes is 226 - 4 = **222**.\n**Answer:** There are **222** integers in the list that are not perfect cubes. \n",
