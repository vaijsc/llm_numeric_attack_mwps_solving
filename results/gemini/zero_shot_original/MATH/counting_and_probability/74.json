        "To get from $A$ to $B$, you need to move 5 steps right and 2 steps up.  Any path from $A$ to $B$ is determined by the order in which you make these steps.  So, a path can be represented by a sequence of 7 letters, 5 of which are \"R\" (for \"right\") and 2 of which are \"U\" (for \"up\").  For example, the path highlighted in blue is represented by the sequence \"RRURRU\".\nThe number of paths is then the number of ways to choose 2 of the 7 positions to be \"U\" (the remaining positions will be \"R\").  This is a combination problem: there are $\\binom{7}{2} = \\boxed{21}$ ways to do this. \n",
        "To get from point $A$ to point $B$, we need to move 5 units to the right and 2 units up.  A path is determined by choosing which 2 of the 7 moves will be up.  There are $\\binom{7}{2} = \\boxed{21}$ ways to do this. \n",
        "To get from point A to point B, you need to move 5 steps to the right and 2 steps up.  Any path from A to B will consist of these 7 steps in some order.  To count the paths, we just need to figure out how many ways to choose which 2 of the 7 steps will be \"up\" steps (the rest will be \"right\" steps).  This is a combination problem: there are $\\binom{7}{2} = \\boxed{21}$ paths. \n",
        "To get from point A to point B, you must move a total of 5 steps to the right and 2 steps up. Any sequence of 5 Rs (right) and 2 Us (up) will get you from A to B.\nFor example, one path could be represented by \"RRRRRUU\".  \nThe problem then becomes: how many ways can we arrange the letters in the word \"RRRRRUU\"?\n* There are 7 total letters.\n* 5 of them are R.\n* 2 of them are U.\nThis is a classic combinatorics problem.  The number of ways to arrange these letters is given by:\n$$\\frac{7!}{5!2!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5!}{5! \\times 2 \\times 1} = \\frac{7 \\times 6}{2} = 21$$\nTherefore, there are **21** possible paths from A to B. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding the Problem**\n* **Grid:**  We have a grid with 6 columns and 3 rows.\n* **Goal:**  We want to find the number of paths from the bottom left corner (point *A*) to the top right corner (point *B*) \n* **Restrictions:** Each step must be either up or to the right.\n**Solution**\n1. **Total Moves:** To reach point *B*, we need to make a total of 5 moves to the right and 2 moves up (since we need to move 5 spaces right and 2 spaces up). \n2. **Arrangement:**  The problem becomes: How many ways can we arrange 5 \"R\"s (right moves) and 2 \"U\"s (up moves)?\n3. **Combinations:** This is a classic combinatorics problem. The number of ways to arrange these letters is:\n   (total number of letters)! / (number of R's)! * (number of U's)!\n   This is the same as  7! / (5! * 2!) = (7*6)/(2*1) = 21\n**Therefore, there are 21 different paths from point *A* to point *B* on the grid.** \n"
