        "Here's how to calculate the expected return:\n**1. Probability of Winning $1:**\n* The player's chosen number must appear on one die, but not both.\n* There are 3 ways this can happen (die 1 shows the number, die 2 doesn't; die 2 shows the number, die 1 doesn't; or both dice show the number, but we'll count this separately).\n* There are 4 possible outcomes for each die. \n* So, the probability of winning $1 is (3 * 4 * 4) / (4 * 4 * 4) = 3/4.\n**2. Probability of Winning $2:**\n* Both dice must show the player's chosen number.\n* The probability of this is (1 * 1) / (4 * 4) = 1/16\n**3. Probability of Losing $1:**\n* The player's chosen number must appear on neither die.\n* This is the opposite of winning $1 or $2, so the probability is 1 - (3/4) - (1/16) = 1/16\n**4. Expected Return:**\n* The expected return is the sum of the products of each outcome's value and its probability:\n   Expected Return = ($1 * 3/4) + ($2 * 1/16) + (-$1 * 1/16) = 3/4 + 1/8 - 1/16 = **11/16** \n**Therefore, the expected return to the player for one roll of the dice is 11/16 dollars.** \n",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Calculate the Probabilities**\n* **Probability of winning $1:**  The player wins $1 if the chosen number appears on one die but not the other.  Let's consider the player chose the number 1 (the logic is the same for any number):\n    * The probability of getting a 1 on the first die is 1/4.\n    * The probability of NOT getting a 1 on the second die is 3/4.\n    * To get a 1 on one die and not the other, we need to consider both orders (1 then not-1, or not-1 then 1): (1/4)(3/4) + (3/4)(1/4) = 3/8.\n* **Probability of winning $2:**  The player wins $2 if the chosen number appears on both dice: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16.\n* **Probability of losing $1:**  The player loses $1 if the chosen number doesn't appear on either die. This is the opposite of winning $1 or $2, so the probability is 1 - (3/8) - (1/16) = 5/8.\n**2. Calculate Expected Return**\nThe expected return is the average of the possible outcomes, weighted by their probabilities:\nExpected Return = (Probability of Winning $1 * $1) + (Probability of Winning $2 * $2) + (Probability of Losing $1 * -$1)\nExpected Return = (3/8 * $1) + (1/16 * $2) + (5/8 * -$1) = -$1/16\n**Answer:** The expected return to the player for one roll of the dice is **-1/16 dollars**.  This means the player is expected to lose an average of 1/16 of a dollar per roll. \n"
