    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "In this problem, Mr. Cole is really selecting two separate groups.  He can choose 3 girls from the 6 girls total in $$ \\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6 \\times 5 \\times 4}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 20 $$ways, and 5 boys from the 11 boys total in $$ \\binom{11}{5} = \\frac{11 \\times 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7}{5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 462 $$ways.  Since these two selections are independent (since for each of the 20 ways to pick the girls, there are 462 ways to pick the boys), we multiply them together to get the number of ways that we can form the 8-member trip: $$ \\binom{6}{3}\\binom{11}{5} = (20)(462) = \\boxed{9,\\!240}. $$",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Choosing the girls:**\n* Mr. Cole needs to choose 3 girls out of 6. \n* This is a combination problem (order doesn't matter), and we use the formula:  \u2076C\u2083 = 6! / (3! * 3!) = 20 \n**2. Choosing the boys:**\n* Mr. Cole needs to choose 5 boys out of 11.\n*  This is also a combination problem: \u00b9\u00b9C\u2085 = 11! / (5! * 6!) = 462\n**3. Combining the choices:**\n*  To find the total number of ways to choose the group, we multiply the number of ways to choose girls by the number of ways to choose boys.\n* Total ways = 20 * 462 = **9240**\n**Therefore, Mr. Cole can select the group in 9240 different ways.** \n",

Combining the Choices:**\n* To find the total number of ways to choose both girls and boys, we multiply the number of ways to choose each group: 20 * 462 = 9240.\n**Answer:** There are 9240 ways Mr. Cole can select 3 girls and 5 boys for the backpacking trip. \n",
