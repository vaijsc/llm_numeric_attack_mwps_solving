        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Find the pattern:**\n* The list increases by 4 each time (10 - 6 = 4, 14 - 10 = 4).\n**2. Determine the number of terms:**\n* This is an arithmetic sequence. To find the number of terms, we can use the formula:\n   *  *n* = (last term - first term)/common difference + 1\n* Plugging in the values:\n   * *n* = (86 - 6) / 4 + 1\n   * *n* = 80 / 4 + 1\n   * *n* = 20 + 1\n   * *n* = 21\n**Answer:** There are **21** numbers in the list. \n",
        "**1. Find the pattern:**\nThe list increases by 4 each time (10 - 6 = 4, 14 - 10 = 4, etc.).\n**2. Determine the number of jumps:**\nTo get from the first number (6) to the last number (86), we need to add 4 repeatedly.  The difference between the last and first number is 86 - 6 = 80.  To find how many times we add 4, we divide: 80 / 4 = 20.\n**3. Count the numbers:**\nWe have 20 jumps, but we need to add 1 to include the first number.\n**Therefore, there are 20 + 1 = 21 numbers in the list.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Identify the Pattern:**\nThe list increases by 4 each time (10 - 6 = 4, 14 - 10 = 4, and so on). This is an arithmetic sequence.\n**2. Find the Common Difference:**\nThe common difference is 4, as we found in step 1.\n**3.  Find the Number of Terms:**\n* **Start with the first term:** 6\n* **Subtract the first term from the last term:** 86 - 6 = 80\n* **Divide the result by the common difference:** 80 / 4 = 20\n* **Add 1 to the result:** 20 + 1 = 21\n**Therefore, there are 21 numbers in the list.** \n",
        "Here's how to figure out how many numbers are in the list:\n**1. Find the pattern:**\n* The list increases by 4 each time (10 - 6 = 4, 14 - 10 = 4, and so on).\n**2. Determine the total difference:**\n* The difference between the first and last number is 86 - 6 = 80.\n**3.  Calculate the number of steps:**\n* Since the list increases by 4 each time, there are 80 / 4 = 20 \"steps\" in the list.\n**4. Add 1 for the initial number:**\n* We need to add 1 to account for the first number (6).\n**Therefore, there are 20 + 1 = 21 numbers in the list.** \n",
