        "Here's how to break down the probability calculation:\n**1.  Calculate the probability of getting exactly 5 ones:**\n* The probability of rolling a 1 on a single die is 1/6.\n* The probability of rolling five 1s in a row is (1/6) * (1/6) * (1/6) * (1/6) * (1/6) = (1/6)^5 = 1/7776\n**2. Calculate the probability of getting at least one 1:**\n* It's easier to calculate the probability of NOT getting any 1s and then subtract from 1.\n* The probability of NOT rolling a 1 on a single die is 5/6.\n* The probability of NOT rolling a 1 on five dice is (5/6)^5 = 3125/7776\n* Therefore, the probability of getting at least one 1 is 1 - (3125/7776) = 4651/7776\n**3. Calculate the probability of getting at most 4 ones:**\n* This is the same as the probability of getting at least one 1, minus the probability of getting exactly 5 ones.\n* Probability (at most 4 ones) = Probability (at least one 1) - Probability (exactly 5 ones)\n* Probability (at most 4 ones) = (4651/7776) - (1/7776) = 4650/7776 \n**Therefore, the probability of getting at most 4 ones when rolling five fair 6-sided dice is 4650/7776, which simplifies to approximately 0.598 or 59.8%.** \n",
        "Here's how to break down the probability calculation:\n**1.  Understanding the Opposite**\nIt's easier to calculate the probability of the event *not* happening and subtract that from 1.  The opposite of \"at most 4 ones\" is \"all 5 dice show a 1\".\n**2.  Probability of All 5 Dice Showing a 1**\n* The probability of rolling a 1 on a single die is 1/6.\n* The probability of rolling a 1 on five consecutive dice is (1/6) * (1/6) * (1/6) * (1/6) * (1/6) = (1/6)^5\n**3.  Probability of At Most 4 Ones**\n*  The probability of getting at most 4 ones is the opposite of getting all 5 ones.  Therefore:\n   * Probability (at most 4 ones) = 1 - Probability (all 5 ones)\n   * Probability (at most 4 ones) = 1 - (1/6)^5 = 1 - (1/7776) = 7775/7776\n**Therefore, the probability of getting at most 4 ones when rolling 5 fair 6-sided dice is 7775/7776.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step by step:\n**1.  Calculate the probability of the opposite event:**\n* The opposite of \"at most 4 ones\" is \"all 5 dice show a 1\".\n* The probability of one die showing a 1 is 1/6.\n* The probability of all five dice showing a 1 is (1/6) * (1/6) * (1/6) * (1/6) * (1/6) = (1/6)^5 = 1/7776\n**2.  Subtract the probability of the opposite event from 1:**\n* The probability of \"at most 4 ones\" is 1 - (probability of all 5 ones) = 1 - (1/7776) = 7775/7776\n**Therefore, the probability of getting at most 4 ones when rolling 5 fair 6-sided dice is 7775/7776.** \n",
        "Here's how to break down the problem and find the probability:\n**1.  Understanding \"At Most 4\"**\n* \"At most 4\" means we want the probability of getting 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 ones.\n**2.  Easier to Calculate the Opposite**\n* It's easier to calculate the probability of the opposite event: getting *exactly 5* ones.  Then we can subtract that from 1 to get our desired probability.\n**3.  Probability of Getting 5 Ones**\n* The probability of getting a 1 on a single die is 1/6.\n* The probability of getting 5 ones in a row is (1/6) * (1/6) * (1/6) * (1/6) * (1/6) = (1/6)^5\n**4.  Probability of \"At Most 4 Ones\"**\n* The probability of getting at most 4 ones is 1 minus the probability of getting exactly 5 ones.\n* Probability = 1 - (1/6)^5 = 1 - (1/7776) = 7775/7776\n**Therefore, the probability of getting at most 4 ones when rolling 5 fair six-sided dice is 7775/7776.** \n",
        "Here's how to break down the probability calculation:\n**1.  Understanding the Opposite**\nIt's often easier to calculate the probability of the event *not* happening and then subtract from 1.  \n* **The opposite of \"at most 4 ones\" is \"all 5 dice show a 1\".**\n**2.  Calculating the Probability of All 5 Dice Showing a 1**\n* Each die has 6 sides, so the probability of rolling a 1 on a single die is 1/6.\n* Since the dice rolls are independent, the probability of getting 5 ones in a row is: (1/6) * (1/6) * (1/6) * (1/6) * (1/6) = (1/6)^5 = 1/7776\n**3.  Calculating the Probability of At Most 4 Ones**\n* The probability of \"at most 4 ones\" is the opposite of \"all 5 ones\".\n* Therefore: 1 - (1/7776) = **7775/7776**\n**So, the probability of getting at most 4 ones when rolling 5 fair 6-sided dice is 7775/7776.** \n"
