    "solution": "We can solve this problem by dividing it into cases. If Markov rolls a 1 or 2 on the first turn, he will flip a coin on the second turn. He must flip a heads to flip a coin on his third turn. There is a $\\frac{2}{6}\\cdot \\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{1}{6}$ chance of this case happening. If Markov does not roll a 1 or 2 on the first turn, he will roll the die on the second turn. He must roll a 1 or 2 on the second turn to flip a coin on the third turn. There is a $\\frac{4}{6}\\cdot \\frac{2}{6}=\\frac{2}{9}$ chance of this case happening. The total probability that Markov will flip a coin on the third turn is then $\\frac{1}{6}+\\frac{2}{9}=\\boxed{\\frac{7}{18}}$.",

        "Here's how we can break down the probability calculation:\n**1.  Possible Scenarios for the Third Turn:**\n* **Scenario 1: Die-Coin-Die:**  Markov rolls the die, then flips the coin, then rolls the die again.\n* **Scenario 2: Die-Coin-Coin:** Markov rolls the die, then flips the coin, then flips the coin again.\n**2.  Calculating Probabilities:**\n* **Scenario 1:**\n    * **Die-Coin:** The probability of rolling a 1 or 2 on the die is 2/6 = 1/3.\n    * **Coin-Die:** The probability of flipping tails is 1/2.\n    * **Probability of Scenario 1:** (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6\n* **Scenario 2:**\n    * **Die-Coin:** The probability of rolling a 1 or 2 on the die is 2/6 = 1/3.\n    * **Coin-Coin:** The probability of flipping heads is 1/2.\n    * **Probability of Scenario 2:** (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6\n**3.  Total Probability:**\nSince these are the only two scenarios where Markov flips the coin on the third turn, we add the probabilities:\nTotal probability = Probability of Scenario 1 + Probability of Scenario 2 = (1/6) + (1/6) = **1/3**\n**Therefore, the probability that Markov will flip the coin on the third turn is 1/3.** \n",

Possible Scenarios to Flip the Coin on the Third Turn**\nThere are two ways Markov can end up flipping the coin on the third turn:\n* **Scenario 1:** Die -> Die -> Coin\n* **Scenario 2:** Die -> Coin -> Coin\n**2.
