    "solution": "There are $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ ways to choose which of the five dice show a 1 or 2. The probability of any one of these occurring is $\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^{\\!2}\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^{\\!3}$.

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Calculate the probability of getting a 1 or 2 on a single die:**\n* There are two favorable outcomes (1 or 2) and six total possibilities.\n* The probability is 2/6 = 1/3.\n**2.  Calculate the probability of getting a 1 or 2 on exactly two dice and not on the other three:**\n*  **Favorable outcomes:** We need to choose 2 dice out of 5 to show a 1 or 2. This can be done in  \u2075C\u2082 ways, which is (5!)/(2!3!) = 10. \n*  **Probability of getting a 1 or 2 on those two dice:**  (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9\n*  **Probability of not getting a 1 or 2 on the remaining three dice:** (2/3) * (2/3) * (2/3) = 8/27\n**3.  Multiply the probabilities:**\n* The probability of the specific scenario (two 1's or 2's, and the rest not) is (10 * 1/9 * 8/27) = 80/243\n**4.  Calculate the final probability:**\n* This is just one possible arrangement (e.g.,  1-2-4-5-6).  We need to account for all possible arrangements of two 1's or 2's and three other numbers.  Since we have 5 dice, there are \u2075C\u2082 = 10 ways to choose the two dice that show a 1 or 2.\n* Therefore, the final probability is (80/243) * 10 = **800/243** \n",
        "Here's how to break down the probability calculation step-by-step:\n**1.  Possible Outcomes**\n* Each die has 6 possible outcomes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).\n* With five dice, there are 6 x 6 x 6 x 6 x 6 = 6\u2075 = 7776 total possible outcomes.\n**2. Favorable Outcomes**\n* **Choosing the two dice:** We need to choose 2 dice out of 5 that will show a 1 or 2.  The number of ways to do this is  \u2075C\u2082 = 10 (using combinations).\n* **Outcomes for the chosen dice:** Each of the two chosen dice has 2 favorable outcomes (1 or 2). So, there are 2 x 2 = 4 favorable outcomes for these two dice.\n* **Outcomes for the remaining dice:** The other three dice must show a number other than 1 or 2, giving them 4 favorable outcomes each (3, 4, 5, or 6). This gives us 4 x 4 x 4 = 64 favorable outcomes.\n**3. Calculating the Probability**\n* **Total favorable outcomes:** 10 (ways to choose dice) * 4 (favorable outcomes for chosen dice) * 64 (favorable outcomes for remaining dice) = 2560\n* **Probability:** (Favorable outcomes) / (Total possible outcomes) = 2560 / 7776 = **16/49**\n**Therefore, the probability of rolling exactly two 1s or 2s with five dice is 16/49.** \n",
