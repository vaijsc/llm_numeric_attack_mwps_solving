    "solution": "In general, \\[(a+b)^3=a^3+3a^2b+3ab^2+b^3\\]\n\nConsider the decimal part separately, so we're trying to find the greatest integer less than $(10+0.3)^3$. By the Binomial Theorem in the above expansion, this is equal to  \\[10^3+3(10^2)(.3)+3(10)(.3^2)+.3^3\\] Expanding these terms, we have that $(10.3)^3=1000+90+2.7+.027$. From this, we find that the greatest integer less than this quantity is $\\boxed{1092}$.",

        "Here's how to find the greatest integer less than $10.3^3$ without a calculator:\n**1. Estimate the Cube:**\n* **Think of nearby perfect cubes:**  We know 10 cubed is 1000. Since 10.3 is slightly larger than 10, its cube will be slightly larger than 1000.\n**2.  Approximate the Difference:**\n* **Focus on the decimal:**  10.3 is 0.3 more than 10.  \n* **Cube the decimal:** 0.3 cubed is a small number, less than 1. \n**3. Combine the Information:**\n* Since 10.3 cubed is only slightly larger than 1000 (by less than 1), the greatest integer less than 10.3 cubed is **1000**. \n",

        "Here's how to find the greatest integer less than $10.3^3$ without a calculator:\n**1. Break down the exponent:**\n*  $10.3^3 = 10.3 \\times 10.3 \\times 10.3$\n**2. Estimate the first two multiplications:**\n*  $10.3 \\times 10.3$ is a bit more than $10 \\times 10 = 100$.  Since 10.3 is a little more than 10, the result will be a bit more than 100. \n*  Let's say it's roughly around 106 (you could be more precise, but we just need a reasonable estimate).\n**3. Estimate the final multiplication:**\n*  Now we need to multiply our estimate of 106 by 10.3.\n*  $106 \\times 10$ is 1060.\n*  Since 10.3 is slightly more than 10, our result will be slightly more than 1060.\n**4. Determine the greatest integer less than the result:**\n* Since our result is slightly more than 1060, the greatest integer less than $10.3^3$ is **1060**. \n",
