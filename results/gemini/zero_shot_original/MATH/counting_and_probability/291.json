        "Here's how to break down the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Choosing the Fruit:**\n* Michael needs to choose 2 different fruits out of 15. \n* This is a combination problem (order doesn't matter) and we use the formula:  nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)\n* So, the number of ways to choose 2 fruits is: 15C2 = 15! / (2! * 13!) = (15 * 14) / (2 * 1) = 105\n**2. Choosing the Soup:**\n* Michael needs to choose 3 different soups out of 10.\n* Again, it's a combination: 10C3 = 10! / (3! * 7!) = (10 * 9 * 8) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 120\n**3. Combining the Choices:**\n* To get the total number of ways Michael can choose his fruits and soups, we multiply the number of ways to choose each: 105 * 120 = 12,600\n**Therefore, there are 12,600 different ways Michael can choose 2 fruits and 3 soups.** \n",

Choosing the Fruit**\n* Michael needs to choose 2 different kinds of fruit out of 15. \n* This is a combination problem (order doesn't matter) and we can use the formula:  \n   _n_C_r_ = n! / (r! * (n-r)!) \n   where n is the total number of items and r is the number you choose.\n* So, the number of ways to choose 2 fruits is: 15C2 = 15! / (2! * 13!) = 105\n**2. Choosing the Soup**\n* Michael needs to choose 3 different kinds of soup out of 10.\n* Using the combination formula: 10C3 = 10! / (3! * 7!) = 120\n**3. Combining the Choices**\n* Since Michael can choose his fruit and soup independently, we multiply the number of fruit choices by the number of soup choices:\n   105 (fruit choices) * 120 (soup choices) = 12,600\n**Answer:** Michael can choose 2 different kinds of fruit and 3 different kinds of soup in **12,600** ways. \n",

Choosing the Fruit**\n* Michael needs to choose 2 different kinds of fruit out of 15. \n* This is a combination problem (order doesn't matter).\n* The formula for combinations is:  nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!) \n* Where n is the total number of items, and r is the number you choose.\n* So, for the fruit: 15C2 = 15! / (2! * 13!) = (15 * 14) / (2 * 1) = 105 ways to choose 2 fruits.\n**2. Choosing the Soup**\n* Michael needs to choose 3 different kinds of soup out of 10.\n* Using the same combination formula: 10C3 = 10! / (3! * 7!) = (10 * 9 * 8) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 120 ways to choose 3 soups.\n**3. Combining the Choices**\n* For each way Michael can choose the fruit, there are 120 ways he can choose the soup.\n* To find the total number of ways to choose both, we multiply the possibilities: 105 * 120 = 12,600\n**Answer:** Michael can choose 2 different kinds of fruit and 3 different kinds of soup in 12,600 different ways. \n",
