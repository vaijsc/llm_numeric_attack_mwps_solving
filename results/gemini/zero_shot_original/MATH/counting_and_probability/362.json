    "solution": "There are 5 white balls and $5+k$ total balls, so the probability that a white ball is drawn is $\\dfrac{5}{5+k}$.  Similarly, the probability that a black ball is drawn is $\\dfrac{k}{5+k}$.  So  \\[ E = \\frac{5}{5+k}(1) + \\frac{k}{5+k}(-1) = -\\frac{1}{2}. \\] Multiply both sides of the equation by $2(5+k)$ to get $10 - 2k = -5 -k$, and we see that $\\boxed{k = 15}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Define the Probability of Each Outcome:**\n* **Probability of winning (drawing a white ball):**  5 / (5 + k) \n* **Probability of losing (drawing a black ball):** k / (5 + k)\n**2. Calculate the Expected Value:**\n* **Expected value = (Probability of winning * Amount won) + (Probability of losing * Amount lost)**\n* In this case:  Expected value = [(5 / (5 + k)) * $1] + [(k / (5 + k)) * (-$1)]\n**3. Set Up the Equation:**\n* We are given that the expected loss is 50 cents, or -$0.50.  Therefore: \n    * (5 / (5 + k)) * $1 + (k / (5 + k)) * (-$1) = -$0.50\n**4. Solve for k:**\n* Simplify the equation:  (5 - k) / (5 + k) = -0.50\n* Multiply both sides by (5 + k): 5 - k = -0.50 (5 + k)\n* Distribute: 5 - k = -2.5 - 0.5k\n* Combine like terms: 7.5 = 0.5k\n* Solve for k: k = 15\n**Answer:** There are **15** black balls in the bin. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Define Expected Value**\nThe expected value (EV) of an event is the average outcome you can expect over the long run.

Set up the Expected Value Equation**\nIn this case, we have two outcomes: winning $1 or losing $1.  \n* **Probability of winning:**  The probability of drawing a white ball is 5 / (5 + k) \n* **Probability of losing:** The probability of drawing a black ball is k / (5 + k) \nSince the expected *loss* is 50 cents (or $0.50), we can set up the equation:\nEV = (5 / (5 + k) * $1) + (k / (5 + k) * -$1) = -$0.50\n**3. Solve for k**\nNow we have an equation with one unknown, 'k'. Let's solve for it:\n* Simplify the equation: (5 - k) / (5 + k) = -0.50\n* Multiply both sides by (5 + k): 5 - k = -0.50 (5 + k)\n* Distribute: 5 - k = -2.5 - 0.5k\n* Combine like terms: 7.5 = 0.5k\n* Solve for k: k = 15\n**Therefore, there are 15 black balls in the bin (k = 15).** \n",
