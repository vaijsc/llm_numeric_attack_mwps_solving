    "solution": "First, a solution with a Venn diagram: [asy]size(230);\nimport graph;\npair A = (0,-1); pair B = (sqrt(3)/2,1/2); pair C = (-sqrt(3)/2,1/2);\ndraw(Circle(A,1.2) ^^ Circle(B,1.2) ^^ Circle(C,1.2));\nlabel(\" 5\",A); label(\"10\",B); label(\"11\",C); label(\"$12$\",(0,0)); label(\"$19$\",(B+C)/2); label(\"$8$\",(A+B)/2); label(\"$17$\",(A+C)/2);\nlabel(\"Math\",2.4C,C); label(\"English\",2.4B,B); label(\"Science\", 2.4A,A);[/asy] We build this diagram by working from the inside out.  First, we put the 12 in the middle for the 12 students who do all three subjects.  We then take care of the other 3 overlap regions by subtracting this 12 from each of the totals of students who did a pair of subjects.  Finally, we can find out the number of students who did only math by subtracting from 59 (the number of students who did math homework) the numbers in the math-and-other-subjects overlaps.  We can then do the same for the other subjects.  Adding all the numbers in the diagram, we see that there are 82 students who did some homework, so there are $100-82=\\boxed{18}$ who did no homework at all.\n\nAlternatively, we could solve this problem by first adding the number of students for each subject.  But students who do two subjects are counted twice, so we subtract the doubles (students doing homework for 2 subjects).  Now, we've added the students who did all three subjects three times (adding them in for each subject) and we've subtracted them three times (once for each \"double\" a student who did all three subjects is in).  So, we haven't counted them at all!  So, we have to add these \"triples\" back in!  This gives a total of  $$59+49+42-20-29-31+12=82$$ students.  There are 100 students total, so there are $100-82 = \\boxed{18}$ students who did no homework.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize with a Venn Diagram**\nDraw three overlapping circles representing Math, English, and Science. The overlapping areas represent students doing homework in combinations of subjects.\n**2. Fill in the Overlap Areas**\n* **All three subjects:** Start with the center of the Venn diagram where all three circles overlap. This is the \"12 students\" who did math, science, and English.\n* **Two subjects:**  \n    *  Math and Science: 29 did both, but 12 did all three, so 29-12 = 17 students did only math and science.\n    * Math and English: 31 did both, but 12 did all three, so 31-12 = 19 students did only math and English.\n    * Science and English: 20 did both, but 12 did all three, so 20-12 = 8 students did only science and English.\n**3. Fill in the Single-Subject Areas**\n* **Math only:** 59 did math, but we need to subtract those who did math with other subjects.  59 - 17 - 19 - 12 = 11 students did only math.\n* **English only:** 49 did English, so 49 - 8 - 19 - 12 = 10 students did only English.\n* **Science only:** 42 did science, so 42 - 17 - 8 - 12 = 5 students did only science.\n**4.  Calculate the Total in the Circles**\nAdd up all the numbers in the Venn diagram: 11 + 19 + 17 + 10 + 8 + 5 + 12 = 82\n**5. Find Those Outside the Circles**\nThe total number of students surveyed is 100. So, 100 - 82 = 18 students did no math, no English, and no science homework.\n**Answer:** 18 students did no math, no English, and no science homework. \n",

The overlapping areas represent students doing combinations of homework.\n**2. Fill in the \"all three\" section:**\nStart with the 12 students who did all three subjects. Write \"12\" in the center where all three circles overlap.\n**3. Fill in the \"two subject\" sections:**\n*  **Math & Science:**  29 students did math and science, and 12 did all three, so 29 - 12 = 17 students did only math and science. Write \"17\" in the overlap between the Math and Science circles.\n*  **Math & English:**  31 students did math and English, and 12 did all three, so 31 - 12 = 19 students did only math and English. Write \"19\" in the overlap between the Math and English circles.\n*  **Science & English:**  20 students did science and English, and 12 did all three, so 20 - 12 = 8 students did only science and English.

Write \"10\" in the English circle only.\n*  **Science Only:** 42 students did science, and we've accounted for 17 + 8 + 12 = 37 students. So, 42 - 37 = 5 students did only science.

Calculate Single-Subject Values**\n* **Math (59):**  We've accounted for 12 + 17 + 19 = 48 in the math circle. Subtract from the total: 59 - 48 = 11. Write 11 in the part of the Math circle that only overlaps with Math.\n* **English (49):**  We've accounted for 12 + 19 + 8 = 39. Subtract from the total: 49 - 39 = 10. Write 10 in the part of the English circle that only overlaps with English.\n* **Science (42):**  We've accounted for 12 + 17 + 8 = 37. Subtract from the total: 42 - 37 = 5.
