    "solution": "If Henry is in the group of 4, there are $\\binom{11}{3}=165$ ways to choose the other people in the group of 4. Then there are $\\binom{8}{3}=56$ ways to choose the group of 3, and the group of 5 is made up of the remaining people. The total number of valid ways to divide the people into groups is $165\\cdot 56=\\boxed{9240}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Place Henry:**\n* Since Henry must be in the group of 4, we've already placed one person in that group.\n**2. Form the group of 4:**\n* We need to choose 3 more people from the remaining 11 people to join Henry in the group of 4.  This can be done in  \u00b9\u00b9C\u2083 ways, which is:\n   \u00b9\u00b9C\u2083 = (11!)/(3!8!) = 165 ways.\n**3. Form the group of 3:**\n*  Now we have 8 people left.  We need to choose 3 of them to form the group of 3.  This can be done in \u2078C\u2083 ways, which is:\n   \u2078C\u2083 = (8!)/(3!5!) = 56 ways.\n**4. The group of 5 is automatic:**\n* The remaining 5 people automatically form the group of 5.\n**5.  Combine the possibilities:**\n* To get the total number of ways to divide the people, we multiply the number of ways to form each group:\n    165 ways (group of 4) * 56 ways (group of 3) = **9240 ways**\n**Therefore, there are 9240 ways to divide the 12 people into a group of 3, a group of 4, and a group of 5, if Henry must be in the group of 4.** \n",

Fill the Group of 4:**\n* We need 3 more people to complete the group of 4.  There are 11 people left to choose from.\n* The number of ways to choose 3 people out of 11 is given by the combination formula:  \u00b9\u00b9C\u2083 = (11!)/(3!8!) = 165.\n**3. Fill the Group of 5:**\n* Now we have 8 people left to choose from.\n* We need to select 5 people for this group: \u2078C\u2085 = (8!)/(5!3!) = 56\n**4. Fill the Group of 3:**\n* The remaining 3 people automatically form the group of 3.\n**5.
