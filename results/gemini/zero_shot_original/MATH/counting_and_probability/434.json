        "A diagonal is a line segment connecting two non-adjacent vertices of the polygon.  Here's how to find the diagonals of hexagon $ABCDEF$:\n* **Start with one vertex:**  Let's start with vertex $A$.  We can draw diagonals to vertices $C$, $D$, and $E$.  (We can't draw a diagonal to $B$ or $F$ because they are adjacent to $A$).\n* **Move to the next vertex:** Now look at vertex $B$.  We can draw diagonals to $D$ and $E$ (but not $A$, $C$, or $F$).\n* **Continue:** We can continue in this way.  We can draw diagonals from $C$ to $E$ and $F$, from $D$ to $F$, and from $E$ to $A$.\nNotice that we've drawn a diagonal twice each (once for each endpoint).  So, in total, we have $9$ diagonals.\n**Therefore, a hexagon has $\\boxed{9}$ diagonals.** \n",
        "Here's how to find the number of diagonals in a hexagon:\n* **What is a diagonal?** A diagonal is a line segment connecting two non-adjacent vertices of a polygon. \n* **Start with one vertex:**  Let's focus on vertex A.  We can draw diagonals from A to C, D, and E.\n* **Avoid counting duplicates:**  We don't want to count diagonal AC and CA as separate diagonals. They are the same line segment.\n* **Repeat for each vertex:** We can repeat this process for each vertex (B, C, D, E, and F).\nHowever, we need to be careful not to overcount.  Each diagonal connects *two* vertices.  \n**Calculation:**\n* Each vertex has 3 diagonals.\n* There are 6 vertices.\n* Total diagonals = (3 diagonals/vertex) * (6 vertices) = 18\n* **But**, we have counted each diagonal twice (once for each endpoint). \n* **Therefore**, the actual number of diagonals is 18 / 2 = **9**. \n",
        "A diagonal of a polygon is a line segment that connects two non-adjacent vertices.  \n*  **Start with one vertex:**  Let's focus on vertex A. How many diagonals can we draw from vertex A?  We can't draw a diagonal to A itself, or to its immediate neighbors B and F. That leaves us with **3** diagonals from vertex A: AC, AD, and AE.\n* **Repeat for other vertices:**  We can follow the same logic for each of the other vertices.  Since each vertex has 3 diagonals, and there are 6 vertices, we might think there are 18 diagonals in total. \n* **Avoid double-counting:**  However, we've double-counted each diagonal (for example, AC is a diagonal from both A and C). Therefore, we need to divide our initial count by 2.\n* **Final count:** There are 18/2 = **9** diagonals in hexagon ABCDEF. \n",

        "Here's how to figure out how many diagonals a hexagon has:\n**Understanding Diagonals**\n* A diagonal is a line segment that connects two non-adjacent vertices of a polygon.\n* **Important:** A side of the hexagon is *not* a diagonal.\n**Counting Diagonals**\n1. **Start with a vertex:**  Pick any vertex of the hexagon.  Let's say we choose vertex A.\n2. **Count potential diagonals:**  From vertex A, you can draw diagonals to vertices C, D, and E (you can't draw a diagonal to B or F because they are adjacent). That's 3 diagonals from vertex A.\n3. **Repeat for all vertices:**  Do the same for each of the other vertices.  You'll find that each vertex will have 3 diagonals connected to it.\n4. **Avoid overcounting:** Notice that we've counted each diagonal twice (once for each endpoint). For example, the diagonal AC was counted when we started at A and again when we started at C.\n**Calculation**\n* You might think there are 6 vertices * 3 diagonals/vertex = 18 diagonals.\n* But, we've overcounted each diagonal twice.\n* Therefore, the total number of diagonals is (6 * 3) / 2 = **9**\n**Answer:** A hexagon has 9 diagonals. \n"
