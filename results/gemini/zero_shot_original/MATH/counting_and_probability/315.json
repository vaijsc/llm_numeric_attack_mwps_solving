    "solution": "There are $\\binom{10}{5} = 252$ ways to choose players for the first team, and the second team gets the remaining players.  However, since the teams are interchangeable, we must divide by two, so the answer is $252 / 2 = \\boxed{126}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this step-by-step:\n1. **Choose the first team:** We need to select 5 players out of 10 for the first team.  This can be done in  \u00b9\u2070C\u2085 ways, which is 10!/(5!5!) = 252 ways.\n2. **The second team is automatic:** Once we've chosen the first team of 5, the remaining 5 players automatically form the second team.\n3. **However, we've overcounted:**  We've counted each team pairing twice (once for choosing Team A first and once for choosing Team B first).\n4. **Adjust for overcounting:** To get the correct number of ways to divide the team, we need to divide our initial count by 2.\n**Therefore, the total number of ways to divide the basketball team into two teams of 5 is 252 / 2 = 126.** \n",

Why? Because we've treated \"Team A\" and \"Team B\" as distinct, but they're really just two halves of the same scrimmage.  \n* We've counted each possible team pairing twice (once as Team A/Team B, and once as Team B/Team A).\n**Step 4: Correcting for overcounting**\n* Since we counted each pairing twice, we need to divide our initial result by 2.\n**Final Calculation**\n* The total number of ways to divide the team is 252 / 2 = **126**. \n",
