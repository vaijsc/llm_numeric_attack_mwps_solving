        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Possible Outcomes for Each Coin:**\n* **Coin A (3 flips):**  There are 2 possible outcomes for each flip (heads or tails), so there are 2 * 2 * 2 = 8 possible outcomes for coin A.\n* **Coin B (4 flips):** Similarly, there are 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 16 possible outcomes for coin B.\n**2.  Possible Combinations:**\n* To get the total possible combinations, we multiply the outcomes of each coin: 8 * 16 = 128 possible combinations.\n**3.  Scenarios with the Same Number of Heads:**\nWe need to find the combinations where the number of heads from coin A matches the number of heads from coin B. Let's list them:\n* **0 Heads:**  (Coin A: TTT, Coin B: TTTT)\n* **1 Head:**  (Coin A: HTT, THT, TTH, Coin B: HTTT, THTT, TTHT, TTTH)\n* **2 Heads:** (Coin A: HHT, HTH, THH, Coin B: HHTT, HTHT, HTTH, THHT, THTH, TTHH)\n* **3 Heads:** (Coin A: HHH, Coin B: HHHT, HTHH, THHH)\n**4.  Calculate the Probability:**\n* Count the number of favorable outcomes (scenarios with the same number of heads): 1 + 4 + 6 + 4 = 15\n* Divide the number of favorable outcomes by the total possible outcomes: 15 / 128\n**Therefore, the probability of obtaining the same number of heads from flipping the two coins is 15/128.** \n",
