        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n* **Step 1: Probability of the first card being a heart**\n   There are 13 hearts and 52 total cards. So the probability of drawing a heart as the first card is 13/52.\n* **Step 2: Probability of the second card being a heart (given the first was a heart)**\n   After drawing one heart, there are only 12 hearts left and 51 total cards.  The probability of drawing another heart is now 12/51.\n* **Step 3: Probability of the third card being a heart (given the first two were hearts)**\n   With two hearts already drawn, there are 11 hearts left and 50 total cards. The probability of drawing a third heart is 11/50.\n* **Step 4: Multiply the probabilities**\n   To get the probability of all three events happening, we multiply the individual probabilities:\n   (13/52) * (12/51) * (11/50) = 11/850\n**Therefore, the probability of drawing three hearts in a row is 11/850.** \n",

So, the probability of drawing another heart is 12/51.\n* **Step 3: Probability of the third card being a heart (given the first two were hearts)**\n   Now there are 11 hearts left and 50 total cards. The probability of drawing a third heart is 11/50.\n* **Step 4: Multiply the probabilities together**\n   To get the probability of all three events happening, we multiply the individual probabilities:\n   (1/4) * (12/51) * (11/50) = 11/850\n**Therefore, the probability of drawing three hearts in a row is 11/850.** \n",
