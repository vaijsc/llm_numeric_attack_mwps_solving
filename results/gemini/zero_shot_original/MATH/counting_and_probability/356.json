    "problem": "How many license plates can be formed if every license plate has 2 different letters (A through Z) followed by 2 different one digit (0-9) numbers?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The first letter can be any of the 26 letters of the alphabet, while the second letter can be any of the 25 remaining letters. The first digit can be any of the 10 digits, while the second digit can be any of the 9 remaining digits. The number of license plates is $26\\times 25\\times 10\\times 9=\\boxed{58,500}$.",

        "Here's how to break down the calculation:\n* **Choosing the first letter:** We have 26 options (A through Z).\n* **Choosing the second letter:**  Since it must be different from the first, we only have 25 options left.\n* **Choosing the first digit:** We have 10 options (0 through 9).\n* **Choosing the second digit:**  Again, it must be different, leaving us with 9 options.\nTo find the total number of combinations, we multiply the number of possibilities at each step:\n26 * 25 * 10 * 9 = **58,500**\nTherefore, there are **58,500** possible license plates that can be formed. \n",
