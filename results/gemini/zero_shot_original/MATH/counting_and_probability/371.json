    "problem": "A deli sandwich consists of one type of bread, one type of meat, and one type of sauce. The deli offers wheat, rye, and white bread; ham, turkey, roast beef, and tuna; ranch and southwest chipotle sauce. Javier is allergic to rye bread, tuna, and southwest chipotle sauce. He tells the server to assemble a random deli sandwich. What is the probability that Javier will suffer an allergic reaction?",

    "solution": "We find the probability that Javier does not suffer an allergic reaction, and subtract from 1. For Javier to not suffer an allergic reaction, the server must choose wheat or white bread; turkey, roast beef, or ham; and ranch sauce. The probability of this occurring is $\\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{3}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$. Therefore, the probability that Javier suffers an allergic reaction is $1-\\frac{1}{4} = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}}$.",

        "Here's how to break down the probability:\n**1. Find the total possible combinations:**\n* **Bread:** 3 options (wheat, rye, white)\n* **Meat:** 4 options (ham, turkey, roast beef, tuna)\n* **Sauce:** 2 options (ranch, southwest chipotle)\nTotal combinations: 3 * 4 * 2 = 24\n**2. Find the combinations that Javier is allergic to:**\n* **Rye bread:**  1 option \n* **Tuna:** 1 option\n* **Southwest Chipotle Sauce:** 1 option\nTo find the total combinations Javier is allergic to, we need to consider all the possible combinations with these allergens:\n* Rye Bread + Any Meat + Any Sauce: 1 * 4 * 2 = 8 combinations\n* Tuna + Any Bread (except rye) + Any Sauce: 1 * 2 * 2 = 4 combinations\n* Any Bread (except rye) + Tuna + Southwest Chipotle Sauce: 2 * 1 * 1 = 2 combinations\n* Rye Bread + Tuna + Any Sauce: 1 * 1 * 2 = 2 combinations\n* Rye Bread + Any Meat + Southwest Chipotle Sauce: 1 * 4 * 1 = 4 combinations\n* Any Bread (except rye) + Tuna + Southwest Chipotle Sauce: 2 * 1 * 1 = 2 combinations\nTotal allergic combinations: 8 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 2 = 22\n**3. Calculate the probability:**\nProbability of allergic reaction = (Number of allergic combinations) / (Total possible combinations)\nProbability = 22 / 24 = 11/12 \n**Therefore, the probability that Javier will suffer an allergic reaction is 11/12.** \n",
        "Here's how to break down the probability:\n**1. Identify the Allergens:**\n* Javier is allergic to rye bread, tuna, and southwest chipotle sauce.\n**2. Count the Total Possible Sandwiches:**\n* **Bread:** 3 choices (wheat, rye, white)\n* **Meat:** 4 choices (ham, turkey, roast beef, tuna)\n* **Sauce:** 2 choices (ranch, southwest chipotle)\nThis gives us a total of 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 possible sandwich combinations.\n**3. Count the Sandwiches with Allergens:**\n* **Rye Bread:** 4 * 2 = 8 sandwiches contain rye bread.\n* **Tuna:** 3 * 2 = 6 sandwiches contain tuna.\n* **Southwest Chipotle Sauce:** 3 * 4 = 12 sandwiches contain southwest chipotle sauce.\n**4. Avoid Overcounting:**\n* Notice that some sandwiches have multiple allergens (e.g., a sandwich with rye bread and tuna).  We've counted these sandwiches multiple times. To avoid overcounting, we need to subtract the sandwiches with both rye and tuna (3 * 1 = 3), rye and southwest chipotle (4 * 1 = 4), and tuna and southwest chipotle (2 * 1 = 2).\n**5. Calculate the Total Allergic Sandwiches:**\n* Total Allergic Sandwiches: 8 + 6 + 12 - 3 - 4 - 2 = 17\n**6. Calculate the Probability of an Allergic Reaction:**\n* Probability = (Number of Allergic Sandwiches) / (Total Possible Sandwiches)\n* Probability = 17 / 24\n**Therefore, the probability of Javier suffering an allergic reaction is 17/24.** \n",
        "Here's how to break down the probability:\n**1. Identify the Allergenic Options:**\n* **Bread:** Rye\n* **Meat:** Tuna\n* **Sauce:** Southwest Chipotle\n**2. Calculate the Total Number of Possible Sandwiches:**\n* Bread Choices: 3 (wheat, rye, white)\n* Meat Choices: 4 (ham, turkey, roast beef, tuna)\n* Sauce Choices: 2 (ranch, southwest chipotle)\n* Total possible combinations: 3 * 4 * 2 = 24\n**3. Calculate the Number of Sandwiches with Allergens:**\n* **Bread:** 1 (rye)\n* **Meat:** 1 (tuna)\n* **Sauce:** 1 (southwest chipotle)\n* **Total Allergenic Combinations:**  1 * 4 * 2 + 3 * 1 * 2 + 3 * 4 * 1 = 26 \n    * We need to add combinations with allergens in each category separately because a sandwich can have more than one allergen.\n**4. Calculate the Probability of an Allergic Reaction:**\n* **Probability:** (Number of Allergenic Sandwiches) / (Total Number of Sandwiches) = 26 / 24 = 13/12 \n**However, this probability is greater than 1, which is impossible.**  This means we've made an error in our calculations. The issue is that we've double-counted some sandwiches. For example, a sandwich with rye bread and tuna is counted twice: once for the rye bread and once for the tuna.\n**Here's the corrected approach:**\n* **Allergenic Sandwiches:**  We need to subtract the combinations that were double-counted.  A sandwich with rye bread, tuna, and southwest chipotle sauce was counted three times. \n    * **Corrected Allergenic Combinations:** 26 - 2 (for the double-counted combinations) = 24 \n* **Probability:** (Number of Allergenic Sandwiches) / (Total Number of Sandwiches) = 24 / 24 = 1\n**Therefore, the probability that Javier will suffer an allergic reaction is 1 (or 100%).**  This means there is a guaranteed chance he'll have an allergic reaction with any random sandwich from this deli. \n",
        "Here's how to break down the probability:\n**1. Identify the Allergic Options:**\n* **Bread:** Javier is allergic to rye bread, leaving him with 2 safe options (wheat and white).\n* **Meat:** Javier is allergic to tuna, leaving him with 3 safe options (ham, turkey, roast beef).\n* **Sauce:** Javier is allergic to southwest chipotle, leaving him with 1 safe option (ranch).\n**2. Calculate the Total Possible Combinations:**\n* There are 3 choices for bread, 4 choices for meat, and 2 choices for sauce. This gives us a total of 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 possible sandwich combinations.\n**3. Calculate the Number of Allergic Combinations:**\n* Since Javier is allergic to rye bread, tuna, and southwest chipotle, he has 1 allergic bread choice, 1 allergic meat choice, and 1 allergic sauce choice. This gives us 1 * 1 * 1 = 1 allergic combination.\n**4. Calculate the Probability of an Allergic Reaction:**\n* The probability of Javier having an allergic reaction is the number of allergic combinations divided by the total possible combinations: 1 / 24 = 1/24.\n**Therefore, the probability that Javier will suffer an allergic reaction is 1/24.** \n",
