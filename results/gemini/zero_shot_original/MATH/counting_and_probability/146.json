    "solution": "Since her friends' birthdays are completely independent of her own, each of them has a $\\frac{1}{7}$ probability of being born on a Tuesday, and a $1 - \\frac{1}{7} = \\frac{6}{7}$ probability of not being born on a Tuesday. If exactly 2 friends were born on a Tuesday, the probability of this occurring is ${3 \\choose 2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{7} \\cdot \\frac{1}{7} \\cdot \\frac{6}{7} = 3 \\cdot \\frac{6}{343} = \\boxed{\\frac{18}{343}}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Probability of a friend being born on Tuesday**\n* There are 7 days in a week, so the probability of a person being born on any specific day (like Tuesday) is 1/7.\n**2. Probability of a friend *not* being born on Tuesday**\n* The probability of a person not being born on Tuesday is 6/7.\n**3.  Possible Scenarios**\nWe want exactly two friends born on Tuesday. There are three possible scenarios:\n* **Scenario 1:** Friend 1: Tuesday, Friend 2: Tuesday, Friend 3: Not Tuesday\n* **Scenario 2:** Friend 1: Tuesday, Friend 2: Not Tuesday, Friend 3: Tuesday\n* **Scenario 3:** Friend 1: Not Tuesday, Friend 2: Tuesday, Friend 3: Tuesday\n**4. Calculating the Probability of Each Scenario**\n* **Scenario 1:** (1/7) * (1/7) * (6/7) = 6/343\n* **Scenario 2:** (1/7) * (6/7) * (1/7) = 6/343\n* **Scenario 3:** (6/7) * (1/7) * (1/7) = 6/343\n**5. Total Probability**\nSince each scenario has an equal probability, we add them together:\n6/343 + 6/343 + 6/343 = 18/343\n**Answer:** The probability of exactly two of Amy's three best friends being born on Tuesday is **18/343**. \n",
        "Here's how to break down the problem:\n* **Each friend has a 1/7 chance of being born on a Tuesday.**  There are 7 days in a week, so each friend has a 1/7 chance of being born on any particular day.\n* **We need two friends born on a Tuesday and one not born on a Tuesday.**  There are three possible scenarios for this:\n    * Tuesday, Tuesday, Not Tuesday\n    * Tuesday, Not Tuesday, Tuesday\n    * Not Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday\n* **Calculate the probability of each scenario:**\n    * The probability of one friend being born on a Tuesday is 1/7. The probability of another friend being born on a Tuesday is also 1/7. The probability of a friend not being born on a Tuesday is 6/7.  Therefore, the probability of the first scenario (Tuesday, Tuesday, Not Tuesday) is (1/7)*(1/7)*(6/7) = 6/343.\n    * The other two scenarios have the same probability: 6/343.\n* **Add the probabilities of each scenario:** The total probability of exactly two friends being born on a Tuesday is 6/343 + 6/343 + 6/343 = **18/343**. \n",
