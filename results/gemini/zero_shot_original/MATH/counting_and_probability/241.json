    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Not considering rotations and reflections, there are 8 ways to choose the first bead to put on the necklace, followed by 7, 6, 5, and 4 ways to choose the next beads. For each arrangements of beads on the necklace, there are 5 ways to rotate it and another 5 ways to reflect it and then rotate it to another arrangement. Thus, arrangements of beads on the necklace come in groups of 10 equivalent arrangements. The total number of different arrangements is therefore $8\\cdot7\\cdot6\\cdot5\\cdot4/10=\\boxed{672}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Ignoring Rotations and Reflections**\n* We have 8 choices for the first bead, 7 for the second, 6 for the third, and so on.\n* This gives us a total of 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 = 6720 ways to arrange the beads.\n**2. Accounting for Rotations**\n* Since rotations are considered the same, each arrangement can be rotated 5 times to get the same necklace. \n* Therefore, we've overcounted by a factor of 5.\n**3. Accounting for Reflections**\n* In addition to rotations, we've also overcounted by a factor of 2 because each necklace can be flipped (reflected).\n**4. The Final Calculation**\n* To get the correct number of distinct necklaces, we need to divide the initial count by 5 (rotations) and 2 (reflections).\n* So, the number of distinct necklaces is 6720 / (5 * 2) = **672**.\n**Therefore, there are 672 ways to put five beads on a necklace if there are eight distinct beads to choose from, and rotations and reflections of the necklace are considered the same.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Consider all arrangements without restrictions**\n* If we ignore the fact that rotations and reflections are the same, we can simply choose 5 beads out of 8. This can be done in  \u2078C\u2085 ways (8 choose 5), which is  \u2078C\u2085 = 8!/(5!3!) = 56.\n**2. Account for rotations**\n* Imagine fixing one bead in place.  The remaining 4 beads can be arranged in 4! = 24 ways. However, since rotations are the same, we've overcounted by a factor of 5 (the number of positions the fixed bead could have occupied).\n**3. Account for reflections**\n* We've overcounted by a factor of 2 because reflections are also the same. \n**4. Final Calculation**\n* To get the correct number of distinct necklaces, we divide the number of unrestricted arrangements by the overcounting factors:\n  56 / (5 * 2) = **5.6**\nSince we can't have a fraction of a necklace, we round down.  \n**Therefore, there are 5 distinct ways to put five beads on a necklace if there are eight distinct beads to choose from, and rotations and reflections are considered the same.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Ignoring Rotations and Reflections**\n*  If we ignore rotations and reflections, we have 8 choices for the first bead, 7 choices for the second, and so on.\n* This gives us a total of 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 = 6720 ways to choose the beads.\n**2. Accounting for Rotations**\n*  Since rotations are considered the same, each unique necklace arrangement can be rotated 5 times to produce the same necklace.\n* We've overcounted by a factor of 5.\n**3. Accounting for Reflections**\n*  For each unique arrangement, we can also reflect it across a diameter of the necklace to get another identical arrangement.\n* We've overcounted by a factor of 2 (original arrangement + reflection).\n**4. The Final Calculation**\n* To get the correct number of distinct necklaces, we divide our initial count by the overcounting factors: 6720 / (5 * 2) = **672**\n**Therefore, there are 672 ways to put five beads on a necklace if there are eight distinct beads to choose from, and rotations and reflections of the necklace are considered the same.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Ignoring Rotations and Reflections**\n* First, imagine we're just arranging the beads in a line.  We have 8 choices for the first bead, 7 for the second, and so on.  This gives us a total of 8*7*6*5*4 = 6720 ways to arrange the beads in a line.\n**2.  Accounting for Rotations**\n* Since rotations of the necklace are considered the same, we've overcounted.  Each arrangement can be rotated 5 times to give the same necklace.  Therefore, we need to divide the number of linear arrangements by 5: 6720 / 5 = 1344.\n**3.  Accounting for Reflections**\n* We also need to account for reflections.  Each necklace can be reflected to produce another identical necklace. However, notice that we've already accounted for half of the reflections by dividing by 5 (rotations include half the possible reflections).  Therefore, we don't need to divide by 2 again.\n**4.  The Final Answer**\n* There are **1344** ways to put five beads on a necklace if there are eight distinct beads to choose from, and rotations and reflections of the necklace are considered the same. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Consider all possible arrangements without restrictions:**\n*  If we were arranging the beads in a line, we'd have 8 choices for the first bead, 7 for the second, and so on.  This gives us 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 = 6720 possible arrangements.\n**2. Account for rotations:**\n*  Since rotations are considered the same, we've overcounted.  Each distinct necklace arrangement can be rotated 5 times to get the same necklace.  Therefore, we divide the initial count by 5: 6720 / 5 = 1344.\n**3. Account for reflections:**\n* We've still overcounted because reflecting a necklace also gives us the same necklace.  However, we need to be careful.  Some necklaces are symmetrical (look the same when reflected). These have already been counted only once in our previous calculation.  \n*  Let's figure out how many symmetrical necklaces there are.  To be symmetrical, the necklace must have a bead on either side of the center bead (which acts as the axis of symmetry).\n*  We have 8 choices for the center bead.  Then, we have 7 choices for the bead on one side, and since the other side must be the same bead, we're done.  This gives us 8 * 7 = 56 symmetrical necklaces.\n**4. Final Calculation:**\n* We've overcounted the symmetrical necklaces by a factor of 2 (we counted each of them twice, once for each reflection).  So, we need to subtract the number of symmetrical necklaces from our count, and then divide by 2 to account for reflections.  This gives us: (1344 - 56) / 2 = 644\n**Therefore, there are 644 ways to put five beads on a necklace if there are eight distinct beads to choose from, and rotations and reflections of the necklace are considered the same.** \n"
