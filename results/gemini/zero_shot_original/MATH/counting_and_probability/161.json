    "problem": "How many distinct arrangements are there of PAPA?",
    "level": "Level 2",

    "solution": "We pretend that the letters are all different, and we have P$_1$A$_1$P$_2$A$_2$.  We have $4!$ permutations (since all the letters are different).\n\nBut how many arrangements of P$_1$A$_1$P$_2$A$_2$ (where the P's and A's are considered different) correspond to a single arrangement of PAPA (where the P's and A's are identical)?  PAPA is counted in 4 different ways: as P$_1$A$_1$P$_2$A$_2$, P$_1$A$_2$P$_2$A$_1$, P$_2$A$_1$P$_1$A$_2$, and P$_2$A$_2$P$_1$A$_1$.  Rather than list out the possibilities, we could have reasoned as follows: For the 2 P's, each possibility is counted $2! = 2$ times, and for the 2 A's, each of these 2 possibilities is counted $2! = 2$ times, for a total of $2 \\times 2 = 4$ ways. (Make sure you see why it isn't $2+2 = 4$ ways.) Therefore, there are 4! ways to arrange the 4 letters P$_1$A$_1$P$_2$A$_2$; this counts each arrangement of PAPA $2! \\times 2! = 4$ times, so we have $4!/(2! \\times 2!) = \\boxed{6}$ ways to arrange PAPA.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Total Possible Arrangements**\n* If all the letters were unique, we'd have 4! (4 factorial) ways to arrange them, which is 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24.\n**2. Accounting for Repetition**\n* However, we have two \"P\"s and two \"A\"s.  We've overcounted the arrangements because we've treated each \"P\" and each \"A\" as unique. \n**3. Dividing to Correct for Overcounting**\n* To correct for the overcounting, we divide the initial number of arrangements by the factorials of the counts of each repeated letter. \n* In this case, we divide by 2! (for the two \"P\"s) and 2! (for the two \"A\"s).\n**4. Calculation**\n* The number of distinct arrangements is: 4! / (2! * 2!) = 24 / (2 * 2) = 6\n**Answer:** There are **6** distinct arrangements of the letters in the word PAPA. \n",

Accounting for Repetition:**\n* However, we have two 'P's and two 'A's. This means we've overcounted our arrangements because we've treated each 'P' and each 'A' as distinct.\n**3. Correcting for Overcounting:**\n* We need to divide the total arrangements by the number of ways to arrange the 'P's and the number of ways to arrange the 'A's:\n   * Number of ways to arrange the 'P's: 2! = 2\n   * Number of ways to arrange the 'A's: 2! = 2\n**4. The Final Calculation:**\n* The number of distinct arrangements of PAPA is:  24 / (2! * 2!) = 24 / 4 = 6\n**Therefore, there are 6 distinct arrangements of the word PAPA.** \n",
