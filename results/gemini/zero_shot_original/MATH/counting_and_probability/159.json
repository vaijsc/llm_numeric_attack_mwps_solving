        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Determine the Probabilities for Each Die**\n* **Total Ratio:** The ratio of probabilities adds up to 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21\n* **Individual Probabilities:** To get the probability of each number, divide the corresponding ratio value by the total ratio:\n    * Probability of rolling a 1: 1/21\n    * Probability of rolling a 2: 2/21\n    * Probability of rolling a 3: 3/21 = 1/7\n    * Probability of rolling a 4: 4/21\n    * Probability of rolling a 5: 5/21\n    * Probability of rolling a 6: 6/21 = 2/7\n**2. Find the Combinations that Result in a Total of 7**\n* The possible combinations to get a total of 7 are:\n    * 1 + 6 \n    * 2 + 5\n    * 3 + 4 \n    * 4 + 3\n    * 5 + 2\n    * 6 + 1\n**3. Calculate the Probability of Each Combination**\n* Remember, the probability of two independent events happening is found by multiplying the individual probabilities.\n* For example, the probability of rolling a 1 on the first die and a 6 on the second die is (1/21) * (2/7) = 2/147\n**4. Sum the Probabilities of All Combinations**\n* Since each combination has an equal chance of occurring, we can add the probabilities of all six combinations:\n    * (1/21) * (2/7) + (2/21) * (5/21) + (1/7) * (4/21) + (4/21) * (1/7) + (5/21) * (2/21) + (2/7) * (1/21) = 48/147 \n**5. Simplify the Answer**\n* The probability of rolling a total of 7 is 48/147, which simplifies to **16/49**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Determine the probabilities for each face:**\n* Since the probabilities are in the ratio 1:2:3:4:5:6, let the probability of rolling a 1 be *x*.\n* Then, the probabilities for rolling 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are 2*x, 3*x, 4*x, 5*x, and 6*x, respectively.\n* The sum of all probabilities for a single die must equal 1: \n   x + 2x + 3x + 4x + 5x + 6x = 1\n* Combining like terms: 21x = 1\n* Solving for x: x = 1/21\n**2. Calculate the probabilities for each face on the die:**\n* Probability of rolling a 1: 1/21\n* Probability of rolling a 2: (2/21)\n* Probability of rolling a 3: (3/21) = 1/7\n* Probability of rolling a 4: (4/21)\n* Probability of rolling a 5: (5/21)\n* Probability of rolling a 6: (6/21) = 2/7\n**3. Identify the combinations that result in a sum of 7:**\n* 1 + 6 \n* 2 + 5\n* 3 + 4\n* 4 + 3\n* 5 + 2\n* 6 + 1\n**4. Calculate the probability of each combination:**\n* For each combination, we need to multiply the probability of getting the first number on one die by the probability of getting the second number on the other die. For example, the probability of getting a 1 on one die and a 6 on the other is (1/21) * (2/7) = 2/147.\n**5. Sum the probabilities of all possible combinations:**\n* (1/21) * (2/7) + (2/21) * (5/21) + (1/7) * (4/21) + (4/21) * (1/7) + (5/21) * (2/21) + (2/7) * (1/21) = **10/147**\n**Therefore, the probability of rolling a total of 7 on the two dice is 10/147.** \n",
