        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Visualize the Cube**\nImagine a cube, and label the vertices A and B as shown in the diagram.\n**2. Possible First Steps**\nFrom vertex A, you have three possible first steps (to the right, forward, or upward).\n**3. Possible Second Steps**\n* **If you went right on the first step:** You have two possible second steps (forward or upward).\n* **If you went forward or upward on the first step:** You have two possible second steps (right or the other direction not yet taken).\n**4. Possible Third Steps**\nAfter taking the first two steps, there's only one possible third step that leads to vertex B.\n**5. Calculate the Total Paths**\n* **Case 1:**  Right, then forward/upward, then the remaining direction = 2 paths\n* **Case 2:** Forward/upward, then right/opposite direction, then the remaining direction = 4 paths\n**Total paths:** 2 + 4 = **6 paths**\nTherefore, there are **6** different three-step paths from vertex A to vertex B. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n* **Step 1:**  From vertex A, there are 3 possible edges you can travel along.\n* **Step 2:**  From the end of the first edge, there are 2 possible edges that lead you closer to vertex B (you can't go back to A).\n* **Step 3:**  From the end of the second edge, there's only 1 edge left that leads directly to vertex B.\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 * 2 * 1 = **6** different three-step paths from vertex A to vertex B. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Visualize the Paths**\nImagine yourself standing at vertex A.  You have three possible first steps. Let's label them:\n* **Step 1a:** Move to the vertex on the top face of the cube, directly above A.\n* **Step 1b:** Move to the vertex on the right face of the cube, directly to the right of A.\n* **Step 1c:** Move to the vertex on the back face of the cube, directly behind A.\n**2. Consider the Second Step**\nFrom each of these first steps, you'll have two possible second steps. For example:\n* **If you took Step 1a:** You can either move to the vertex on the front face of the cube, or the vertex on the back face.\n* **If you took Step 1b:** You can either move to the vertex on the front face, or the vertex on the top face.\n* **If you took Step 1c:** You can either move to the vertex on the top face, or the vertex on the right face.\n**3. The Final Step**\nNo matter what your first two steps were, you'll always have a single possible third step that takes you to vertex B.\n**4. Count the Paths**\n* **Step 1:** 3 choices\n* **Step 2:** 2 choices for each choice of Step 1\n* **Step 3:** 1 choice for each combination of Step 1 and Step 2\nTherefore, the total number of paths is 3 * 2 * 1 = **6**. \n",
