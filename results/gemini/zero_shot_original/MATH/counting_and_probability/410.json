    "solution": "We have to use a little bit of casework to solve this problem. If the first die shows a 1, the second die can be anything (6 cases). If the first die shows 2 or 4, the second die is limited to 1, 3, or 5 ($2\\cdot3 = 6$ cases). If the first die shows 3, the second die can be 1, 2, 4, or 5 (4 cases). If the first die shows 5, the second die can be anything but 5 (5 cases). If the first die shows 6, the second die can be only 1 or 5 (2 cases). There are 36 ways to roll two dice, 23 of which are valid, so the answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{23}{36}}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understanding Relatively Prime**\nTwo numbers are relatively prime (or coprime) if their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1.  In other words, they share no common factors other than 1.\n**2. Total Possible Outcomes**\nEach die has 6 sides, so there are 6 * 6 = 36 possible outcomes when rolling two dice.\n**3. Counting Favorable Outcomes**\nWe need to count the pairs that are relatively prime.  Let's systematically list them:\n* **1:**  (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6)  \n* **2:** (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5)\n* **3:** (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5)\n* **4:** (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5)\n* **5:** (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6)\n* **6:** (6, 1), (6, 5)\nThere are 24 pairs that are relatively prime.\n**4.
