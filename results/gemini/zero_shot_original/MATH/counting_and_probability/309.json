    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "It is impossible for Pat to select both 3 oranges and 6 apples, so we can calculate the probabilities of these mutually exclusive cases separately and then add to get our final answer. The probability that 3 particular pieces of fruit will be oranges and the rest will not be is given by $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{3}\\right)^3\\left(\\dfrac{2}{3}\\right)^5=\\dfrac{32}{6561}$, and there are $\\binom{8}{3}=56$ ways of selecting three pieces of fruit to be the oranges so the probability that 3 will be oranges is $56\\cdot\\dfrac{32}{6561}=\\dfrac{1792}{6561}$. Similarly, the probability that 6 particular pieces of fruit will be apples and the other two won't be is given by $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{3}\\right)^6\\left(\\dfrac{2}{3}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{4}{6561}$ and there are $\\binom{8}{6}=28$ ways of selecting which ones will be the apples, so multiplying again gives us a probability of $28\\cdot\\dfrac{4}{6561}=\\dfrac{112}{6561}$. Adding those two probabilities give us our final answer: $\\dfrac{1792}{6561}+\\dfrac{112}{6561}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{1904}{6561}}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Calculate the probability of exactly 3 oranges**\n* **Combinations:** We need to figure out how many ways Pat can choose 3 oranges out of 8. This is a combination problem, and we use the formula:  \u2078C\u2083 = 8! / (3! * 5!) = 56 \n* **Possible outcomes for the remaining fruits:**  Since Pat has already chosen 3 oranges, he has 5 slots left. He can fill these with apples and bananas in 2\u2075 = 32 ways (each slot has 2 choices).\n* **Total possible outcomes:**  Pat has 3 choices for each of the 8 fruits (orange, apple, banana).  This gives him 3\u2078 = 6561 total possible outcomes.\n* **Probability of exactly 3 oranges:** (56 * 32) / 6561 \u2248 0.273\n**2. Calculate the probability of exactly 6 apples**\n* **Combinations:**  \u2078C\u2086 = 8! / (6! * 2!) = 28 ways to choose 6 apples.\n* **Possible outcomes for the remaining fruits:**  2\u00b2 = 4 ways to choose the remaining 2 fruits (orange or banana).\n* **Probability of exactly 6 apples:** (28 * 4) / 6561 \u2248 0.017\n**3.  Add the probabilities together (since the events are mutually exclusive)**\nThe probability of either exactly 3 oranges or exactly 6 apples is:\n0.273 + 0.017 \u2248 **0.29**\n**Therefore, the probability that Pat chooses either exactly 3 oranges or exactly 6 apples is approximately 0.29.** \n",
