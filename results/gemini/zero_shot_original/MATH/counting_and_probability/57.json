        "To get from point $C$ to point $D$, you need to move a total of 4 steps to the right and 6 steps down.  \nThink of each path as a sequence of \"R\" (right) and \"D\" (down).  For example, the path \"RRDDDRR\" would mean moving right twice, then down twice, then right once, then down three times, and finally right twice.\nSince we need 4 \"R\"s and 6 \"D\"s, the problem boils down to finding the number of ways to arrange these 10 letters.  This is a classic combination problem: we have 10 slots to fill, and we need to choose 4 of them to be \"R\"s (the rest will automatically be \"D\"s).  \nTherefore, there are $\\binom{10}{4} = \\boxed{210}$ possible paths. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding the Problem**\nWe need to find all possible routes from point C to point D, moving only down or to the right. Imagine you're walking on this grid.\n**Key Insight**\n* **Total Moves:** To get from C to D, you need to make a total of 4 moves to the right and 6 moves down (4 + 6 = 10 moves).\n* **Choosing Directions:** Each path is determined by which 4 of the 10 moves are to the right.  The rest will automatically be down.\n**Solving the Problem**\n* **Combinations:**  The problem is equivalent to choosing 4 moves out of 10 to be \"right\". This is a classic combination problem.\n* **Formula:** The number of ways to choose *k* items out of *n* is given by the combination formula:  nCk = n! / (k! * (n-k)!)\n* **Calculation:** In our case, we have n = 10 (total moves) and k = 4 (moves to the right). \n    * 10C4 = 10! / (4! * 6!) = (10 * 9 * 8 * 7) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 210\n**Answer**\nThere are **210** paths from point C to point D on the grid. \n",
        "To get from point $C$ to point $D$, you need to move 4 steps to the right and 6 steps down.  Any path from $C$ to $D$ can be represented by a sequence of R's (for right) and D's (for down).  For example, the path \"RRDDRDDRRD\" represents moving two steps right, then two steps down, then one step right, then two steps down, then one step right, then one step down, then one step right, then one step down.\nSince we need 4 R's and 6 D's, we just need to figure out how many ways to arrange these letters. This is a classic combinatorics problem.  We have 10 total steps (4 R's + 6 D's), and we need to choose 4 of them to be R's. The number of ways to do this is:\n$$\\binom{10}{4} = \\frac{10!}{4!6!} = \\boxed{210}$$ \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding the Problem**\nWe need to find all the possible ways to move from point C to point D, only allowed to move down or right.  Imagine this like a robot moving on a grid.\n**The Key Insight**\n* **Total Moves:** To get from C to D, we need to move 4 steps right (to get to the right edge) and 6 steps down (to get to the bottom edge).  This gives us a total of 10 moves.\n* **Choosing Moves:** Every possible path is determined by which 4 of these 10 moves are right moves (the other 6 will be down moves).\n**Using Combinations**\nThis problem is about choosing 4 things from a set of 10.  This is a classic combinatorics problem, and we use the following formula:\n* **Combinations:**  The number of ways to choose *r* items from a set of *n* items (where order doesn't matter) is denoted by  nCr or  (n choose r) and calculated as: \n    *  nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)\n**Solving the Problem**\nIn our case, we want to find 10C4:\n* 10C4 = 10! / (4! * 6!)\n* = (10 * 9 * 8 * 7) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1)\n* = 210\n**Answer**\nThere are **210** paths from C to D. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding the Constraints**\n* **Down or Right:**  You can only move one step down (south) or one step right (east) at a time.\n* **Goal:**  You want to get from point C to point D.\n**Visualizing the Path**\nImagine you're drawing a path from C to D. Every step you take will be either down or right.  To reach D, you need to move a total of:\n* 4 steps to the right \n* 6 steps down \n**The Solution**\nAny path from C to D will consist of 10 steps (4 right + 6 down).  The only thing that changes is the order in which you take those steps.  \n* **Think of it like this:** You have 10 spots to fill (representing each step), and you need to choose 4 of them to be \"right\" steps. The remaining 6 will automatically be \"down\" steps.\nThis is a combination problem!  The number of ways to choose 4 steps out of 10 is:\n\u00b9\u2070C\u2084 = 10! / (4! * 6!) = 210\n**Therefore, there are 210 different paths from C to D.** \n"
