    "solution": "We can rewrite $2007^3$ as the cube of a binomial: \\begin{align*}\n2007^3 &= (2\\cdot 10^3 + 7)^3\\\\\n&= \\binom{3}{0} (2\\cdot 10^3)^3 + \\cdots + \\binom{3}{3} 7^3\n\\end{align*}\n\nOnly the first and last term of the binomial expansion affect the values of $F$ and $L$. The first term is equal to $8\\cdot 10^9$, so $F = 8$. The last term is equal to 343, so $L = 3$. Therefore, $F + L = \\boxed{11}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Estimate the Magnitude**\n*  2007 is a little more than 2000.\n*  2000 cubed is 8,000,000,000 (8 billion).\n*  Since 2007 is slightly larger than 2000, its cube will be slightly larger than 8 billion.\n**2. Determine the First and Last Digits**\n* **First Digit (F):**  Since the cube of 2007 is slightly larger than 8 billion, the first digit will be **8**.\n* **Last Digit (L):** To find the last digit, focus on the units digit of 2007, which is 7.  \n    * 7 cubed is 343. The units digit of 343 is **3**.\n**3. Calculate F + L**\n* F + L = 8 + 3 = **11**\n**Therefore, the value of F + L is 11.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step by step:\n**1. Estimate the Size**\n*  Notice that 2007 is a bit more than 2000.\n*  Cubing 2000 gives us 8,000,000,000 (a number with ten digits).\n*  Since 2007 is slightly larger than 2000, we can expect $2007^3$ to be a bit larger than 8,000,000,000, but still a ten-digit number.\n**2. Focus on the Last Digit**\n* The last digit of a number is determined by the last digit of its factors.\n* The last digit of 2007 is 7.\n*  Let's look at the pattern of the last digit of powers of 7:\n    * 7\u00b9 = 7\n    * 7\u00b2 = 49\n    * 7\u00b3 = 343\n    * 7\u2074 = 2401 \n* Notice the pattern: The last digit cycles through 7, 9, 3, 1. Since 3 is a multiple of 3, the last digit of $2007^3$ is **3**. \n**3.  Approximate the First Digit**\n*  Since $2007^3$ is a bit bigger than 8,000,000,000, the first digit will be **8**.\n**4. Calculate F + L**\n*  We found that F = 8 and L = 3.\n*  Therefore, F + L = 8 + 3 = **11**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Estimate the Magnitude:**\n*  Since 2007 is a bit more than 2000, we can estimate that 2007\u00b3 is a bit more than (2000)\u00b3. \n*  (2000)\u00b3 = 8,000,000,000, which has 10 digits.  So, 2007\u00b3 will also have 10 digits.\n**2. Focus on the First and Last Digits:**\n* **First Digit (F):** The first digit of 2007\u00b3 will be determined mainly by the '2' in 2007.
