        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**Understanding the Problem**\nWe need to find the number of ways to select a group of 3 people from a larger group of 8.  Since the order we choose the people doesn't matter (a committee of John, Mary, and Bob is the same as a committee of Mary, Bob, and John), we're dealing with combinations.\n**Formula for Combinations**\nThe number of ways to choose *r* items from a set of *n* items (where order doesn't matter) is given by the following formula:\nnCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)\nWhere:\n* nCr represents the number of combinations\n* n! (n factorial) means n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 2 * 1\n**Applying the Formula**\nIn our case:\n* n = 8 (total number of people)\n* r = 3 (size of the committee)\nSo, the number of ways to choose a 3-person committee is:\n8C3 = 8! / (3! * (8-3)!)\n     = 8! / (3! * 5!)\n     = (8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((3 * 2 * 1) * (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1))\n     = (8 * 7 * 6) / (3 * 2 * 1)\n     = 56\n**Answer:** There are **56** ways to choose a 3-person committee from a group of 8 people. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understanding Combinations**\nThis problem involves combinations because the order in which we choose the committee members doesn't matter.  A committee of John, Sarah, and Mike is the same as a committee of Sarah, Mike, and John.\n**2. The Formula**\nThe number of ways to choose a committee of *r* people from a group of *n* people is given by the following formula:\nnCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)\nWhere:\n* nCr represents the number of combinations\n* n! means n factorial (n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 2 * 1)\n**3. Applying the Formula**\n* n = 8 (total number of people)\n* r = 3 (number of people on the committee)\nSo, we have:\n8C3 = 8! / (3! * (8-3)!)\n     = 8! / (3! * 5!)\n     = (8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((3 * 2 * 1) * (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1))\n     = 336 / (6 * 120)\n     = 336 / 720\n     = 56\n**Answer:** There are 56 ways to choose a 3-person committee from a group of 8 people. \n",

Formula for Combinations**\nThe number of ways to choose a committee of *r* people from a group of *n* people is given by the following formula:\n   _n_C_r_ = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)\nWhere \"!\" represents the factorial (e.g., 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)\n**3. Applying the Formula**\n* **n = 8** (total number of people)\n* **r = 3** (size of the committee)\nSubstitute these values into the formula:\n_8_C_3_ = 8! / (3! * (8-3)!) \n          = 8! / (3! * 5!)\n          = (8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((3 * 2 * 1) * (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1))\n          = 336 / 120\n          = 28\n**Answer:** There are **28** ways to choose a 3-person committee from a group of 8 people. \n",
