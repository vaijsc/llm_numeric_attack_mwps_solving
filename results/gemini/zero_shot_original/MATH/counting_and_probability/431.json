    "solution": "The probability that Stu pulls the M out first is 1/7. The probability that he then pulls the A out next is 1/6, since there are now 6 letter remaining.  Continuing in this way, the probability that he pulls out T next is 1/5 and the probability that H then follows is 1/4.  Therefore, the probability that he pulls out M, A, T, H in this order is $1/7 \\times 1/6 \\times 1/5 \\times 1/4 = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{840}}$.",
