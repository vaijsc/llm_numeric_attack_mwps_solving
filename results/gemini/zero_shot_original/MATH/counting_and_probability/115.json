    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are a total of $\\binom{14}{5}=2002$ ways of selecting a subcommittee of 5 with no restrictions on the membership. Of these committees, the only ones that will violate the given condition are the ones that consist entirely of Republicans or entirely of Democrats. There are $\\binom{8}{5}=56$ possible subcommittees that have all 5 members selected from among the 8 Republicans and $\\binom{6}{5}=6$ possible subcommittees that have all 5 members selected from among the 6 Democrats. Subtracting the number of subcommittees that don't work from the total number of possible subcommittees gives us our answer: $2002-56-6=\\boxed{1940}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Consider the Restrictions:**\n* We need at least one Republican and one Democrat. \n**2.  Break It Down by Cases:**\nSince we need at least one of each party, the possible subcommittees are:\n* **Case 1: 3 Republicans and 2 Democrats**\n* **Case 2: 2 Republicans and 3 Democrats**\n**3. Calculate Combinations for Each Case:**\n* **Case 1:** \n    * Number of ways to choose 3 Republicans out of 8:  \u2078C\u2083 = (8!)/(3!5!) = 56\n    * Number of ways to choose 2 Democrats out of 6: \u2076C\u2082 = (6!)/(2!4!) = 15\n    * Total ways for Case 1: 56 * 15 = 840\n* **Case 2:**\n    * Number of ways to choose 2 Republicans out of 8: \u2078C\u2082 = (8!)/(2!6!) = 28\n    * Number of ways to choose 3 Democrats out of 6: \u2076C\u2083 = (6!)/(3!3!) = 20\n    * Total ways for Case 2: 28 * 20 = 560\n**4. Add the Cases Together:**\n* Total ways to form the subcommittee: 840 + 560 = **1400**\n**Therefore, there are 1400 ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members with at least one member from each party.** \n",
