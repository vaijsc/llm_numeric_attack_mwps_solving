    "solution": "Here an `outcome' is selecting two different 2-digit numbers, without regard to order.  There are 90 2-digit numbers, so this can be done in $\\binom{90}{2} = 4005$ ways.\n\nNow we need to count the successful outcomes.  Two numbers multiply together to give an even number if at least one of the original numbers is even.  To count this will require some casework.  However, casework makes us think about using complementary counting here.  We see that it's easier to count when the product of two numbers is odd: this happens when both original numbers are odd.\n\nThere are 45 odd 2-digit numbers, so two of them can be chosen in $\\binom{45}{2}= 990$ ways.  These are the unsuccessful outcomes, so there are $4005-990 = 3015$ successful outcomes.  Therefore the probability is $\\frac{3015}{4005} = \\boxed{\\frac{67}{89}}$.",

        "Here's how to break down the problem:\n**Understanding the Concepts**\n* **Even Numbers:** An even number is any number divisible by 2.\n* **Multiplication:** When you multiply two numbers, the result is even if at least one of the original numbers is even.\n**Reasoning**\n1. **Possible Cases:** There are two possibilities:\n    * **Case 1: At least one of the 2-digit numbers is even.**  This will always result in an even product.\n    * **Case 2: Both of the 2-digit numbers are odd.** This will also result in an even product.\n2. **Probability:** Since both cases lead to an even product, the only way to get an odd product is if both numbers are odd.  Therefore, the probability of getting an even product is much higher than the probability of getting an odd product.\n**Calculating the Probability**\n* There are 90 two-digit numbers (from 10 to 99).\n* There are 45 odd two-digit numbers (11, 13, 15... 99).\n* The probability of choosing an odd number is 45/90 = 1/2.\n* The probability of choosing two odd numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.\n* Therefore, the probability of getting an odd product is 1/4.\n* The probability of getting an even product is 1 - (1/4) = 3/4.\n**Answer:** The probability that the product of two randomly chosen 2-digit numbers is even is **3/4**. \n",
        "Here's how to break down the problem:\n**Understanding the Basics**\n* **Even Numbers:** A number is even if it's divisible by 2.\n* **Multiplication:** When you multiply two numbers, the result is even if at least one of the original numbers is even.\n**Thinking Step-by-Step**\n1. **Possible Outcomes:** We're choosing two 2-digit numbers. There are 90 possible 2-digit numbers (from 10 to 99).  \n2. **Cases for an Even Product:**\n   * **Case 1:** Both numbers are even. \n   * **Case 2:** One number is even, and the other is odd.\n3. **Calculating Probabilities:**\n   * **Case 1:**  There are 45 even numbers between 10 and 99 (10, 12, 14,... 98).  The probability of picking one even number is 45/90. The probability of picking another even number (after already picking one) is 44/89.  The probability of Case 1 happening is (45/90) * (44/89).\n   * **Case 2:** There are 45 even numbers and 45 odd numbers. The probability of picking an even number then an odd number is (45/90) * (45/89).  The probability of picking an odd number then an even number is (45/90) * (45/89).  We need to add these probabilities together.\n4. **Total Probability:** Add the probabilities of Case 1 and Case 2 to get the overall probability of the product being even.\n**Calculations**\n* Probability of Case 1: (45/90) * (44/89) = 22/89\n* Probability of Case 2: (45/90) * (45/89) + (45/90) * (45/89) = 45/89\n* **Total Probability:** 22/89 + 45/89 = **67/89**\n**Answer:** The probability of the product of two randomly chosen 2-digit numbers being even is **67/89**. \n",
        "Here's how to break down the problem step by step:\n**Understanding Even and Odd Numbers**\n* **Even numbers** are divisible by 2 (e.g., 2, 4, 6, 8, 10...).\n* **Odd numbers** are not divisible by 2 (e.g., 1, 3, 5, 7, 9...).\n**Key Principle**\nThe product of two numbers is even if at least one of the numbers is even.\n**Applying the Principle**\n1. **Case 1: At least one number is even.**  This is the most likely scenario.  Since we're choosing two-digit numbers randomly, there are many more even numbers (20, 22, 24... 98) than odd numbers (21, 23, 25... 99). \n2. **Case 2: Both numbers are odd.**  This is less likely, but it will still result in an even product.\n**Conclusion**\nSince the probability of choosing at least one even number is very high, the probability that the product of two randomly chosen two-digit numbers is even is **extremely high, practically close to 1 (or 100%)**.\n**Formal Approach**\nWhile calculating the exact probability would involve considering all possible combinations of two-digit numbers, the logic above shows that the probability of getting an even product is overwhelmingly high.\n",
