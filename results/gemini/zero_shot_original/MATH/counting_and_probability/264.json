    "solution": "We can count the number of ways to choose a group of 4 green and 2 red peppers and the number of ways to choose 5 green and 1 red peppers. These are $\\binom{5}{4}\\binom{10}{2}=5\\cdot45=225$ and $\\binom{5}{5}\\binom{10}{1}=10$. The total number of ways the cook can choose peppers is $\\binom{15}{6}=5005$. Therefore, the probability that out of six randomly chosen peppers at least four will be green is $\\frac{235}{5005}=\\boxed{\\frac{47}{1001}}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Calculate the total number of ways to choose 6 peppers:**\n* The cook has 15 peppers in total.\n* The number of ways to choose 6 out of 15 is given by the combination formula:  \u00b9\u2075C\u2086 = (15!)/(6!9!) = 5005\n**2.  Calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 4 green peppers:**\n* The cook needs to choose 4 green peppers out of 5: \u2075C\u2084 = (5!)/(4!1!) = 5\n* The cook also needs to choose 2 red peppers out of 10: \u00b9\u2070C\u2082 = (10!)/(2!8!) = 45\n* To get exactly 4 green peppers, multiply these two combinations: 5 * 45 = 225\n**3.  Calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 5 green peppers:**\n* The cook needs to choose 5 green peppers out of 5: \u2075C\u2085 = (5!)/(5!0!) = 1\n* The cook also needs to choose 1 red pepper out of 10: \u00b9\u2070C\u2081 = (10!)/(1!9!) = 10\n* To get exactly 5 green peppers, multiply these two combinations: 1 * 10 = 10\n**4.  Calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 6 green peppers:**\n* The cook needs to choose 6 green peppers out of 5: This is impossible since there are only 5 green peppers.\n**5.  Calculate the probability of selecting at least 4 green peppers:**\n* Add the number of ways to choose 4, 5, or 6 green peppers: 225 + 10 + 0 = 235\n* Divide this by the total number of ways to choose 6 peppers: 235/5005\n**Therefore, the probability of the cook selecting at least 4 green peppers is 235/5005.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Find the total number of ways to choose 6 peppers:**\n* The cook has 15 peppers in total.\n* The number of ways to choose 6 out of 15 is given by the combination formula:  \u00b9\u2075C\u2086 = 15!/(6!9!) = 5005\n**2. Find the number of ways to choose exactly 4 green peppers:**\n*  We need 4 green peppers out of 5: \u2075C\u2084 = 5\n*  We also need 2 red peppers out of 10: \u00b9\u2070C\u2082 = 45\n*  To get the total number of ways to choose 4 green and 2 red, multiply: 5 * 45 = 225\n**3. Find the number of ways to choose exactly 5 green peppers:**\n*  We need 5 green peppers out of 5: \u2075C\u2085 = 1\n*  We also need 1 red pepper out of 10: \u00b9\u2070C\u2081 = 10\n*  To get the total number of ways to choose 5 green and 1 red, multiply: 1 * 10 = 10\n**4. Find the number of ways to choose exactly 6 green peppers:**\n*  We need 6 green peppers out of 5:  This is impossible, so there are 0 ways.\n**5. Calculate the probability:**\n*  The probability of selecting at least 4 green peppers is the sum of the probabilities of selecting exactly 4, 5, or 6 green peppers.\n*  Probability = (Favorable outcomes) / (Total possible outcomes)\n*  Probability = (225 + 10 + 0) / 5005 = **235/5005** \n",
