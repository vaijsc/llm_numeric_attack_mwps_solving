    "solution": "We first note that each circle can intersect any other circle a maximum of two times.\n\nTo begin, the first circle is drawn. The second circle is then drawn overlapping the first, and two points of intersection are created. Since each pair of circles overlap (but are not exactly on top of one another), then the third circle drawn can intersect the first circle twice and the second circle twice. We continue in this manner with each new circle drawn intersecting each of the previously drawn circles exactly twice. That is, the third circle drawn intersects each of the two previous circles twice, the fourth circle intersects each of the three previous circles twice, and so on.  Diagrams showing possible arrangements for $3,$ $4,$ and $5$ circles, each giving the maximum number of intersections, are shown below.\n\n[asy]\ndraw((Circle((-6,.2),1)));\ndraw((Circle((-5,.2),1)));\ndraw((Circle((-5.5,1.2-sqrt(3)),1)));\ndraw((Circle((-2,-0.3),1)));\ndraw((Circle((-2,0.3),1)));\ndraw((Circle((-.5,-0.3),1)));\ndraw((Circle((-.5,0.3),1)));\n\ndraw((Circle((3.6,.3),1)));\ndraw((Circle((2,.3),1)));\ndraw((Circle((2.3,-0.3),1)));\ndraw((Circle((3.3,-0.3),1)));\ndraw((Circle((2.8,.8),1)));\n[/asy]\n\n\nThe resulting numbers of intersections are summarized in the table below.\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\\hline\nCircles&New intersections&Total number of intersections\\\\ \\hline\n1&0&0\\\\ \\hline\n2&2&2\\\\ \\hline\n3&$2\\times2=4$&$2+4$\\\\ \\hline\n4&$3\\times2=6$&$2+4+6$\\\\ \\hline\n5&$4\\times2=8$&$2+4+6+8$\\\\ \\hline\n6&$5\\times2=10$&$2+4+6+8+10$\\\\ \\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\nContinuing in this vein, the greatest possible total number of intersection points using ten circles is\\[2+4+6+8+10+12+14+16+18=\\boxed{90}.\\] Or, we notice that every unique pair of circles carries at most two unique intersections. There are $\\binom{10}{2} = \\frac{10\\cdot 9}{2!} = 45$ different pairs of circles, which give a total of $2\\cdot 45 = \\boxed{90}$ possible intersections.\n\nTo be complete, we technically need to show that this number is possible, though we don't expect students to do this to answer the question. The diagram below demonstrates a possible positioning of the ten circles that achieves the maximum $90$ points of intersection. That is, every pair of circles intersects exactly twice and all points of intersection are distinct from one another. It is interesting to note that this diagram is constructed by positioning each of the ten circles' centres at one of the ten vertices of a suitably sized regular decagon, as shown.\n\n[asy]\ndraw((.31,-.95)--(0,0)--(.31,.95)--(1.12,1.54)--(2.12,1.54)--(2.93,.95)--(3.24,0)--(2.93,-.95)--(2.12,-1.54)--(1.12,-1.54)--cycle,linewidth(1));\ndraw((Circle((.31,-.95),2.12)));\ndraw((Circle((0,0),2.12)));\ndraw((Circle((.31,.95),2.12)));\ndraw((Circle((1.12,1.54),2.12)));\ndraw((Circle((2.12,1.54),2.12)));\ndraw((Circle((2.93,.95),2.12)));\ndraw((Circle((3.24,0),2.12)));\ndraw((Circle((2.93,-.95),2.12)));\ndraw((Circle((2.12,-1.54),2.12)));\ndraw((Circle((1.12,-1.54),2.12)));\n[/asy]",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Two Circles:**\n* Two circles can intersect at a maximum of **2** points.\n**2.  Three Circles:**\n* Imagine adding a third circle. It can intersect each of the first two circles at two points each, for a maximum of **4** new intersection points.  \n* Total intersection points: 2 + 4 = **6**\n**3.  Four Circles:**\n*  Adding a fourth circle can intersect each of the previous three circles at two points each, for a maximum of **6** new intersection points.\n* Total intersection points: 6 + 6 = **12**\n**4.  The Pattern:**\nNotice that with each additional circle, we add twice the number of intersections as the number of circles already present.  This is because each new circle creates two new intersections with every circle it overlaps.\n**5.  Ten Circles:**\nTo find the maximum number of intersection points for ten circles, we can use this pattern:\n* 2 circles: 2 intersections\n* 3 circles: 2 + 4 = 6 intersections\n* 4 circles: 6 + 6 = 12 intersections\n* 5 circles: 12 + 8 = 20 intersections\n* 6 circles: 20 + 10 = 30 intersections\n* 7 circles: 30 + 12 = 42 intersections\n* 8 circles: 42 + 14 = 56 intersections\n* 9 circles: 56 + 16 = 72 intersections\n* 10 circles: 72 + 18 = **90 intersections**\n**Therefore, the greatest possible total number of intersection points of ten circles is 90.** \n",

        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding the Problem**\n* We have ten circles of the same size.\n* Each pair of circles overlaps, meaning they intersect.\n* No circle is directly on top of another.\n**Finding the Maximum Intersections**\n1. **Two Circles:**  Two circles can intersect at a maximum of **2** points.\n2. **Three Circles:**  Imagine adding a third circle. It can intersect each of the first two circles at two points, but it's possible that one of these points is the same point where the first two circles intersect. So, the maximum is **3 + 2 = 5** intersection points.\n3. **Four Circles:**  Adding a fourth circle could add another two points for each of the existing three, but again, we might have some overlap. The maximum is **5 + 3 = 8** intersection points.\n4. **General Pattern:** You can see a pattern emerging: with each new circle, you can add a maximum of two intersection points for every existing circle, but we need to be careful about overcounting.\n**The Solution**\nTo get the maximum number of intersections, we need to avoid any points being counted more than once. This means each new circle should intersect the existing circles in completely new points.  \n* **First Circle:** 0 intersections\n* **Second Circle:** 2 intersections \n* **Third Circle:** 4 intersections \n* **Fourth Circle:** 6 intersections\n* **Fifth Circle:** 8 intersections\n* **Sixth Circle:** 10 intersections\n* **Seventh Circle:** 12 intersections\n* **Eighth Circle:** 14 intersections\n* **Ninth Circle:** 16 intersections\n* **Tenth Circle:** 18 intersections\n**Total:**  0 + 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 12 + 14 + 16 + 18 = **90**\n**Therefore, the greatest possible total number of intersection points for ten overlapping circles is 90.** \n",

        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n* We have 10 circles of equal size.\n* Each pair of circles overlaps.\n* No circle is perfectly on top of another.\n**Finding the Pattern:**\n1. **Two Circles:** When two circles overlap, they create **two** intersection points.\n2. **Three Circles:**  When a third circle overlaps the first two, it can create **two** new intersection points with each of the existing circles.
