    "solution": "A cube has four red faces if it is attached to exactly two other cubes.  The four top cubes are each attached to only one other cube,  so they have five red faces.  The four bottom corner cubes are each attached to three others, so they have three red faces.  The remaining $\\boxed{6}$ each have four red faces.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Identify the Cubes with Four Red Faces**\n* **Corners:**  The cubes at the corners of the figure will have four red faces. There are **8** corner cubes.\n* **Edges:** The cubes along the edges of the figure (not including corners) will have four red faces. There are **6** edge cubes.\n**2.  Total Cubes with Four Red Faces**\nThere are a total of 8 corner cubes + 6 edge cubes = **14** cubes with exactly four red faces. \n**Therefore, all 14 of the individual cubes have exactly four red faces.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step by step:\n**1. Identify the Cubes with Four Red Faces**\n* A cube will have four red faces if it is in the center of one of the faces of the larger figure.\n* Think of the larger figure as having six faces (top, bottom, and four sides).\n**2. Count the Cubes with Four Red Faces**\n* **Top and Bottom:** There is one cube in the center of the top face and one in the center of the bottom face. \n* **Sides:**  Each side of the larger figure has one cube in the center. Since there are four sides, there are four cubes with four red faces.\n**3. Total Cubes with Four Red Faces**\n* Total cubes with four red faces: 1 (top) + 1 (bottom) + 4 (sides) = **6**\n**Therefore, there are 6 individual cubes with exactly four red faces.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Identify the Cubes with Four Red Faces**\n* **Corner Cubes:** The cubes at the very corners of the figure will have four red faces. There are **8** corner cubes.\n* **Edge Cubes (except corners):** The cubes along the edges (not including the corner cubes) will have four red faces.  There are **6** edge cubes with four red faces.\n**2. Total Cubes with Four Red Faces**\n* Add the corner cubes and the edge cubes with four red faces: 8 + 6 = **14**\n**Answer:** All 14 individual cubes have exactly four red faces. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Identify the Cubes with Four Red Faces:**\n* **Corner Cubes:**  A cube that has four red faces must be a corner cube of the figure.  This is because it needs to have four sides touching other cubes.\n**2. Count the Corner Cubes:**\n* Look at the figure. You'll notice there are **8** corner cubes in total.\n**3. Consider Hidden Faces:**\n* The figure is painted on all sides, including the bottom.  Even the cubes that aren't visible on the top of the figure will have red faces on their bottom and sides. \n**Answer:** There are **8** individual cubes with exactly four red faces. \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem:\n**1. Identify the Cubes with Four Red Faces**\n* A cube will have four red faces if it's a corner cube, meaning it has faces exposed on all sides except the one that was touching another cube.\n**2. Count the Corner Cubes**\n* Look at the figure.  There are **8** corner cubes.\n**3. Answer**\n* Therefore, **8** of the individual cubes will have exactly four red faces. \n"
