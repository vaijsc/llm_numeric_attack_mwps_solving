        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Total Possible Outcomes:**\n* For each question, there are 2 possibilities (True or False).\n* With 10 questions, the total number of possible ways to answer the test is 2 * 2 * 2 * ... (10 times) = 2^10 = 1024\n**2. Unfavorable Outcomes (Less than 3 False):**\n* **Zero False:** There's only 1 way to answer all True.\n* **One False:** We need to choose 1 question out of 10 to be False. This can be done in 10 ways (using combinations: \u2081\u2080C\u2081 = 10).\n* **Two False:** We need to choose 2 questions out of 10 to be False. This can be done in 45 ways (using combinations: \u2081\u2080C\u2082 = 45).\n**3. Favorable Outcomes (At Least 3 False):**\n* To find the number of ways to answer with at least 3 False, we subtract the unfavorable outcomes from the total outcomes:\n  1024 (Total) - 1 (Zero False) - 10 (One False) - 45 (Two False) = **968**\n**Therefore, there are 968 ways to answer a 10-question true/false test with at least 3 questions answered as False.** \n",

Unfavorable Outcomes:**\n* We need to count the ways to answer the test with 0, 1, or 2 false answers.  Let's break it down:\n    * **0 False Answers:** There's only 1 way to answer all questions true.\n    * **1 False Answer:** There are 10 ways to choose which question is false (10C1 = 10).\n    * **2 False Answers:** There are 45 ways to choose which two questions are false (10C2 = 45).\n**3.  Favorable Outcomes:**\n* The number of ways to answer at least 3 questions false is the total number of ways minus the unfavorable ways:\n    * Favorable outcomes = 1024 - 1 - 10 - 45 = 968\n**Therefore, there are 968 ways to answer a 10-question true/false test with at least 3 false answers.** \n",
