    "solution": "A number is a perfect square and a perfect cube if and only if it is a perfect sixth power.  Note that $10^2 = 100$ and $4^3<100<5^3$, while $2^6 < 100 < 3^6 = 9^3$.  Hence, there are 10 squares and 4 cubes between 1 and 100, inclusive.  However, there are also 2 sixth powers, so when we add $10 + 4$ to count the number of squares and cubes, we count these sixth powers twice.  However, we don't want to count these sixth powers at all, so we must subtract them twice.  This gives us a total of $10 + 4 - 2\\cdot 2 = 10$ different numbers that are perfect squares or perfect cubes, but not both.  Thus, our probability is $\\frac{10}{100} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{10}}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Perfect Squares:**\n* The perfect squares between 1 and 100 are: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, and 100. \n* There are 10 perfect squares.\n**2. Perfect Cubes:**\n* The perfect cubes between 1 and 100 are: 1, 8, 27, and 64.\n* There are 4 perfect cubes.\n**3. Overlap:**\n* Notice that 1 and 64 are both perfect squares *and* perfect cubes.  We've counted these twice.\n**4. Adjusting for Overlap:**\n* We have 10 perfect squares + 4 perfect cubes - 2 numbers counted twice = 12 numbers that are either a perfect square or a perfect cube.\n**5. Probability:**\n* The probability of choosing a number that is a perfect square or a perfect cube (but not both) is 12 (favorable outcomes) out of 100 (total possible outcomes).  This simplifies to the fraction **3/25**. \n",
