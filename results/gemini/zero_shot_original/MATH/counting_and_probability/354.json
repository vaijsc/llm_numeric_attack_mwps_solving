    "solution": "We calculate the probability that he does not draw a card from at least three of the suits. To do this, we calculate the number of sets of 5 cards from at most two suits and divide by $\\binom{52}5$, the number of sets of 5 cards. Since there are $\\binom42=6$ choices for the two suits, and $\\binom{26}5$ ways to choose 5 cards from the 26 in those two suits, our answer would appear to be $6\\binom{26}5$. But this triple-counts the ways to choose the cards from a single suit: 5 hearts is included in 5 (hearts and spades), 5 (hearts and clubs), and 5 (hearts and diamonds). So we subtract twice the number of ways to choose cards from a single suit: $6\\binom{26}5-2\\cdot4\\binom{13}5$. We divide this by $\\binom{52}5$ to get $$\\frac{6\\cdot26\\cdot25\\cdot24\\cdot23\\cdot22-8\\cdot13\\cdot12\\cdot11\\cdot10\\cdot9}{52\\cdot51\\cdot50\\cdot49\\cdot48}=\\frac{88}{595}.$$Therefore, the probability that he draws three or four of the suits is $1-\\frac{88}{595}=\\boxed{\\frac{507}{595}}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Calculate the probability of NOT getting at least three suits.**\n   * This means Mike gets either all cards from the same suit (a flush) or cards from only two suits.\n   * **Case 1: All cards from the same suit**\n      * There are 4 suits to choose from.\n      * Once a suit is chosen, there are 13 cards to draw.\n      * The probability of getting a flush is: 4 * (13/52) * (12/51) * (11/50) * (10/49) * (9/48) = 11/4165\n   * **Case 2: Cards from only two suits**\n      * There are 4 choose 2 = 6 ways to pick two suits.\n      * Let's say the suits are hearts and diamonds. The probability of getting all hearts or all diamonds is 2 * (13/52) * (12/51) * (11/50) * (10/49) * (9/48) = 11/4165\n      * Since there are 6 combinations of two suits, the probability of getting cards from only two suits is 6 * (11/4165) = 66/4165\n   * **Total Probability of Not Getting at Least Three Suits:**\n      * The probability of getting all cards from the same suit OR cards from only two suits is (11/4165) + (66/4165) = 77/4165\n**2. Calculate the probability of getting at least three suits.**\n   * The probability of getting at least three suits is the opposite of not getting at least three suits: 1 - (77/4165) = **3988/4165**\n**Therefore, the probability of Mike drawing a card from at least three of the four suits is 3988/4165.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Calculate the probability of NOT getting at least three suits.**\n*   This means Mike gets all five cards from just two suits.\n*   **Choose two suits:** There are  \u2074C\u2082 = 6 ways to choose two suits out of four.\n*   **Cards from those suits:**  For each chosen suit, there are 13 cards. So, we have 13 * 13 = 169 ways to choose five cards from those two suits.\n*   **Total possibilities:** The total number of ways to draw five cards from a deck of 52 is \u2075\u00b2C\u2085 = 2,598,960.\n**2.
