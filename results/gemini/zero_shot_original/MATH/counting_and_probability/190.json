    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "We solve by casework.\n\n$\\bullet$ Case I: Exactly one T in the sequence. There are $3$ slots in which the $T$ could be placed. Then, there are $4$ choices $(A,$ $R,$ $G,$ or $E)$ for the second slot and $3$ for the third, giving a total of $3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 = 36$ sequences.\n\n$\\bullet$ Case II: Exactly two Ts in the sequence. There are $3$ slots in which the non-$T$ can be placed, and there are $4$ possibilities for the letter choice. So, there are a total of $3 \\cdot 4 = 12$ such sequences.\n\nThus, there are $36 + 12 = \\boxed{48}$ possible sequences.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the total number of sequences without any restrictions:**\n* There are 6 choices for the first letter, 5 choices for the second letter, and 4 choices for the third letter.\n* This gives us a total of 6 * 5 * 4 = 120 possible sequences.\n**2. Find the number of sequences with NO \"T\":**\n* There are 5 letters remaining (A, R, G, E, and the other \"T\").\n* We have 5 * 4 * 3 = 60 sequences without a \"T\".\n**3. Subtract to find sequences with at least one \"T\":**\n* The number of sequences with at least one \"T\" is the total number of sequences minus the number of sequences with no \"T\".\n* 120 - 60 = **60**\n**Therefore, there are 60 distinct three-letter sequences with at least one \"T\" that can be formed using the letters in TARGET.** \n",
