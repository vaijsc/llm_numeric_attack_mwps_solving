    "solution": "We need exactly two flips to come up heads and three to come up tails. The odds that two flips come up heads is $\\left(\\dfrac{2}{3}\\right)^2$ and the odds that the other three all come up tails is $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{3}\\right)^3$. We then need to consider the distinct ways of positioning the heads among the 5 flips: we can put the first one in any of 5 places and the second one in any of the remaining 4 places, but they aren't distinct so we need divide by 2 for a total of $\\dfrac{5\\times4}{2}=10$ ways. Thus the probability is $\\left(\\dfrac{2}{3}\\right)^2\\times\\left(\\dfrac{1}{3}\\right)^3\\times10=\\boxed{\\dfrac{40}{243}}$.\n\nAlternatively, we can view flipping this coin 5 times as being equivalent to the expansion of $(h+t)^5$ where $h=\\frac{2}{3}$ and $t=\\frac{1}{3}$. The value of the $h^nt^{5-n}$ term in this expansion will be the probability of getting exactly $n$ heads, so setting $n=2$ and applying the binomial theorem gives us $p=\\dbinom{5}{2}\\left(\\dfrac{2}{3}\\right)^2\\left(\\dfrac{1}{3}\\right)^3=\\boxed{\\dfrac{40}{243}}$, which is the same answer we got using the other method.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step by step:\n**1. Understand the problem:**\n* We have an unfair coin, meaning the probability of getting heads (H) is different from the probability of getting tails (T). \n* We want to find the probability of getting exactly two heads in five flips.\n**2. Identify the individual probabilities:**\n* **Probability of getting heads (H):**  P(H) = 2/3\n* **Probability of getting tails (T):** P(T) = 1 - P(H) = 1 - 2/3 = 1/3\n**3. Determine the possible successful outcomes:**\nWe need two heads (HH) and three tails (TTT) in any order. Here are some possibilities:\n* HH TTT\n* HTH TT\n* HTTH T\n* HTTT H\n* THH TT\n* THTT H\n* TTHH T\n* TTHT H\n* TTTH H\n**4. Calculate the probability of each successful outcome:**\nFor example, let's take the outcome \"HH TTT\":\n* P(HH TTT) = (2/3) * (2/3) * (1/3) * (1/3) * (1/3) = 4/243\nNotice that each successful outcome has the same probability.\n**5. Calculate the total probability:**\nSince there are 9 successful outcomes, we multiply the probability of one outcome by 9:\n* Total Probability = 9 * (4/243) = **12/81**\n**Therefore, the probability of getting exactly two heads in five flips of this unfair coin is 12/81.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this step-by-step:\n**1. Identify the probability of success and failure:**\n* **Success:**  Getting heads (probability = 2/3)\n* **Failure:** Getting tails (probability = 1 - 2/3 = 1/3)\n**2. Determine the number of ways to get exactly two heads:**\n* We need to figure out how many different combinations of 5 flips can result in exactly 2 heads.  This is a classic combinatorics problem. \n* The formula for combinations is: nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!), where n is the total number of trials and r is the number of successes.\n* In our case, n = 5 (5 flips) and r = 2 (2 heads). So, 5C2 = 5! / (2! * 3!) = 10. There are 10 different ways to get exactly two heads.\n**3. Calculate the probability of each specific combination:**\n* Each specific combination of 2 heads and 3 tails has the same probability: (2/3)^2 * (1/3)^3 = 4/243\n**4. Multiply the probability of each combination by the number of combinations:**\n* The final probability is the probability of each combination multiplied by the number of combinations: (4/243) * 10 = **40/243**\n**Therefore, the probability of getting exactly two heads in 5 flips of an unfair coin with a 2/3 probability of landing heads is 40/243.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Basics**\n* **Unfair coin:**  The coin doesn't have an equal chance of landing heads or tails.\n* **Probability of heads (p):**  The coin lands heads with a probability of 2/3.\n* **Probability of tails (q):**  The coin lands tails with a probability of 1 - (2/3) = 1/3.\n* **Number of flips (n):**  We're flipping the coin 5 times.\n* **Number of successes (k):**  We want exactly two heads.\n**2. Use the Binomial Probability Formula**\nThe binomial probability formula helps us calculate the probability of getting exactly *k* successes in *n* trials:\nP(exactly k successes) = (n choose k) * p^k * q^(n-k)\nWhere:\n* **(n choose k)** represents the number of ways to choose *k* successes from *n* trials.  This is calculated as n! / (k! * (n-k)!). \n* **p^k** represents the probability of getting *k* successes.\n* **q^(n-k)** represents the probability of getting (n-k) failures.\n**3. Plug in the Values**\n* n = 5 (number of flips)\n* k = 2 (number of heads)\n* p = 2/3 (probability of heads)\n* q = 1/3 (probability of tails)\nP(exactly 2 heads) = (5 choose 2) * (2/3)^2 * (1/3)^3\n**4. Calculate**\n* **(5 choose 2):**  5! / (2! * 3!) = 10\n* **(2/3)^2:** 4/9\n* **(1/3)^3:** 1/27\nP(exactly 2 heads) = 10 * (4/9) * (1/27) = **40/243**\n**Answer:** The probability of getting exactly two heads in five flips of this unfair coin is 40/243. \n",
        "Here's how to break down the problem:\n**1. Identify the type of probability distribution:**\n* We have a fixed number of trials (5 coin flips).\n* Each trial has two possible outcomes (heads or tails).\n* The probability of success (heads) is the same for each trial (2/3).\nThis fits the description of a **binomial distribution**.\n**2. The binomial probability formula:**\nThe probability of getting exactly *k* successes in *n* trials, with probability of success *p* on each trial, is given by:\nP(X = k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\nwhere (n choose k) is the binomial coefficient, calculated as n! / (k! * (n-k)!).\n**3. Apply the formula to our problem:**\n* n = 5 (number of coin flips)\n* k = 2 (number of heads)\n* p = 2/3 (probability of heads)\nSo, we need to find:\nP(X = 2) = (5 choose 2) * (2/3)^2 * (1/3)^3\n**4. Calculate:**\n* (5 choose 2) = 5! / (2! * 3!) = 10\n* (2/3)^2 = 4/9\n* (1/3)^3 = 1/27\nTherefore:\nP(X = 2) = 10 * (4/9) * (1/27) = **40/243**\n**Answer:** The probability of getting exactly two heads in 5 flips of an unfair coin with a probability of 2/3 of landing heads is **40/243**. \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem step by step:\n**1.  Understand the Basics**\n* **Unfair Coin:** The coin has a bias, meaning heads (H) and tails (T) don't have equal probabilities. \n* **Probability of Heads:**  P(H) = 2/3\n* **Probability of Tails:** P(T) = 1 - P(H) = 1/3\n* **Independent Events:** Each coin flip is independent of the others.  The outcome of one flip doesn't influence the outcome of the next.\n**2.  Possible Outcomes**\nTo get exactly two heads in five flips, we need to consider all the possible sequences of heads and tails where there are exactly two heads. Here are some examples:\n* HHTTT\n* TTHHT\n* HTHTT \n* ... and so on\n**3.  Calculate the Probability of a Single Outcome**\nLet's take the example of HHTTT. The probability of this specific sequence is:\n* P(HHTTT) = P(H) * P(H) * P(T) * P(T) * P(T) = (2/3) * (2/3) * (1/3) * (1/3) * (1/3) = 4/243\n**4.  Count the Number of Favorable Outcomes**\nWe need to figure out how many different combinations of two heads and three tails are possible.  This is a classic combination problem:\n* The number of ways to choose 2 heads out of 5 flips is given by the binomial coefficient: \u2075C\u2082 = 5! / (2! * 3!) = 10\n**5.  Calculate the Total Probability**\nSince each of the 10 possible outcomes has a probability of 4/243, the total probability of getting exactly two heads in five flips is:\n* P(Exactly 2 Heads) = 10 * (4/243) = **40/243** \n"
