        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding the Problem**\n* **Identical Lamps:**  The lamps are indistinguishable.  It doesn't matter which specific lamp goes on a table, just how many are on each.\n* **Identical Tables:**  The tables are also indistinguishable.  It doesn't matter which table has a certain number of lamps. \n**Solution**\nThis is a classic \"balls and urns\" problem.  Think of the lamps as balls and the tables as urns.\n1. **Visualize:** Imagine you have 3 urns (tables) and 10 balls (lamps).  You need to figure out how many ways you can distribute the balls into the urns.\n2. **Dividers:**  To separate the balls into the urns, you need two dividers.  Think of it like this:\n   * **|**  **|**  **|**\n   You have 10 balls and 2 dividers.  \n3. **Arrangement:**  You need to arrange the 10 balls and 2 dividers in a row. This is a total of 12 items.\n4. **Combinations:** The number of ways to arrange these items is:\n   * 12! / (10! * 2!) = 66\n**Therefore, there are 66 ways to put the lamps on the tables.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n* **Think of the lamps as identical balls and the tables as distinct boxes.**  We need to find the number of ways to distribute 10 balls into 3 boxes.\n* **Consider the \"stars and bars\" method.**  Imagine we have 10 stars (representing the lamps) and we need to place 2 bars to separate them into 3 groups (representing the tables).\n* **Example:**  \"****|***|***\" represents 4 lamps on the first table, 3 on the second, and 3 on the third.\n* **Total arrangements:** We have 12 positions (10 stars and 2 bars). To find the number of arrangements, we need to choose 2 of these positions for the bars. \n* **Calculation:** The number of ways to choose 2 positions out of 12 is given by the combination formula:  \u00b9\u00b2C\u2082 = 12! / (2! * 10!) = 66\n**Therefore, there are 66 ways for Kim to put all the lamps on the tables.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step by step:\n**Understanding the Problem**\n* **Identical Lamps:**  The lamps are indistinguishable from each other. It doesn't matter which lamp is on which table, only how many are on each table.\n* **Identical Tables:**  The tables are also indistinguishable. \n**Using Stars and Bars**\nWe can use a helpful method called \"stars and bars\" to solve this.\n1. **Represent the Lamps:** Imagine the lamps as stars: \n   ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** \n2. **Represent the Divisions:** Since we have 3 tables, we need 2 dividers (\"bars\") to separate the lamps into groups:\n   *****|*****|***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** *****\n3. **Counting Arrangements:**  Now, think about rearranging the stars and bars.  Each arrangement represents a different way to distribute the lamps. For example:\n    * **|***** *****|***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** *******  means 0 lamps on the first table, 10 lamps on the second table, and 0 lamps on the third.\n    * ******* ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** *****|***** *****|** means 7 lamps on the first table, 3 on the second, and 0 on the third.\n4. **Total Arrangements:** We need to figure out how many ways we can arrange 10 stars and 2 bars.  There are a total of 12 positions (10 stars + 2 bars).  We need to choose 2 of those positions to be bars. This is a combination problem:\n   *  \u00b9\u00b2C\u2082 = (12!)/(2!10!) = 66\n**Answer:** There are **66** ways for Kim to put all the lamps on the tables. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding the Problem**\nWe need to figure out how many different ways Kim can distribute 10 lamps across 3 tables.  It doesn't matter which lamp goes on which table, only how many are on each table.\n**Thinking Step-by-Step**\n1. **Distribute the Lamps:**  We can think about this like putting dividers between the lamps.  Imagine the lamps lined up:\n   *L*L*L*L*L*L*L*L*L*L* \n2. **Add Dividers:** We need two dividers to separate the lamps into three groups (representing the tables):\n   *L*L*L*|L*L*L*|L*L*L*L* \n3. **Counting Arrangements:**  Now we have 12 items (10 lamps and 2 dividers).  To find the number of ways to arrange them, we use combinations:\n   * **Total arrangements:** 12! (12 factorial)\n   * **Dividers are identical:** 2! (2 factorial)\n   * **Lamps are identical:** 10! (10 factorial)\n4. **Calculate:** The number of ways to arrange the lamps is:\n   (12!)/(10! * 2!) = (12 * 11)/(2 * 1) = 66\n**Answer:** There are **66** ways for Kim to put all the lamps on the tables. \n",
