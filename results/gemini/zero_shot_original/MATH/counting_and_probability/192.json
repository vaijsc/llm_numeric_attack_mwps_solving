    "solution": "There are a total of $\\dbinom{20}{2}=190$ ways to choose two distinct vertices.  When the line is drawn connecting these vertices, some will correspond to edges or face diagonals, and the rest will lie inside the dodecahedron. Each of the 12 pentagonal faces has 5 edges.  This makes a total of $5\\cdot12=60$ edges.  This counts each edge twice, once for each adjacent face, so there are only $60/2=30$ edges.  Each of the 12 pentagonal faces also has $5$ face diagonals.  This can be seen by drawing out an example, or remembering that an $n$ sided polygon has $\\frac{n(n-3)}{2}$ face diagonals.  This is a total of $5\\cdot 12= 60$ face diagonals.\n\nTherefore, of the 190 ways to choose two vertices, $190-30-60=100$ will give lines that lie inside the dodecahedron when connected.  The probability of selecting such a pair is then: $$\\frac{100}{190}=\\boxed{\\frac{10}{19}}$$",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\nWe need to find the probability that a random line segment connecting two vertices of a dodecahedron lies entirely within the dodecahedron.  This means the line segment shouldn't pass through any faces.\n**2.  Visualizing the Dodecahedron**\nImagine a dodecahedron.  Think about the different ways you can connect two vertices.  Some lines will be completely inside, while others will intersect a face.\n**3.  Focus on the Faces**\nTo find the probability, it's easier to think about the cases where the line *does* intersect a face.  We'll subtract this probability from 1 to get the probability of the line being inside.\n**4.  Counting Favorable Cases**\n* **Choose a face:** There are 12 faces to choose from.\n* **Choose two vertices on that face:**  Each pentagon has 5 vertices, so we can choose 2 in  \u2075C\u2082 = 10 ways.\n* **Total ways to choose two vertices:** We have 20 vertices, so we can choose 2 in \u00b2\u2070C\u2082 = 190 ways.\n**5. Calculating the Probability of the Line Intersecting a Face**\nThe probability of choosing two vertices that lie on the same face is:\n(12 faces * 10 ways to choose vertices on a face) / (190 ways to choose two vertices) = 120/190 = 12/19\n**6. Calculating the Probability of the Line Being Inside**\nThe probability of choosing two vertices that form a line segment completely inside the dodecahedron is:\n1 - (Probability of line intersecting a face) = 1 - 12/19 = **7/19**\n**Therefore, the probability that the line connecting two randomly chosen vertices of a dodecahedron lies inside the dodecahedron is 7/19.** \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem:\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\n* We have a dodecahedron, which is a 3D shape with 12 regular pentagons as faces.\n* We randomly pick two vertices (corners) of the dodecahedron.\n* We want to find the probability that the line segment connecting these two vertices lies entirely *inside* the dodecahedron.\n**2.  Identifying Favorable Outcomes**\n* A line segment connecting two vertices lies inside the dodecahedron if and only if the two vertices are *adjacent* (connected by an edge of the dodecahedron).\n**3. Calculating Total Outcomes**\n* There are 20 vertices in a dodecahedron.\n* We need to choose 2 of them, so we use combinations:  \u00b2\u2070C\u2082 = (20 * 19) / (2 * 1) = 190. This represents the total number of ways to choose 2 vertices.\n**4. Calculating Favorable Outcomes**\n* Each vertex of the dodecahedron is connected to 3 other vertices (since each pentagon has 5 vertices and each vertex is shared by 3 pentagons).\n* However, we've counted each edge twice (once for each endpoint).\n* Therefore, there are (20 * 3) / 2 = 30 edges (and 30 pairs of adjacent vertices).\n**5. Calculating the Probability**\n* The probability of choosing two adjacent vertices is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes:\n   Probability = 30 / 190 = **3/19**\n**Therefore, the probability that the line connecting two randomly chosen vertices of a dodecahedron lies inside the dodecahedron is 3/19.** \n",

Key Observations:**\n* **Internal Lines:**  A line connecting two vertices lies inside the dodecahedron only if it doesn't pass through any faces.\n* **External Lines:** A line connecting two vertices will lie outside the dodecahedron if it intersects one or more faces.\n**3. Counting the Possibilities:**\n* **Total Ways to Choose Two Vertices:** We have 20 vertices, and we need to choose 2. The number of ways to do this is  20C2 = (20*19)/(2*1) = 190. \n* **Ways to Choose Two Vertices that Create an Internal Line:** This is trickier. We need to think about the structure of the dodecahedron.  There are a few approaches:\n    * **Direct Counting:** We could try to directly count the number of pairs of vertices that form internal lines. This would involve visualizing the dodecahedron and carefully considering its structure.\n    * **Using Symmetry:** The dodecahedron has a lot of symmetry. We could try to identify a smaller subset of vertex pairs and use symmetry to extend our count.\n**4. Finding the Probability:**\n* **Probability = (Favorable Outcomes) / (Total Outcomes)**\n* Once we know the number of favorable outcomes (pairs of vertices creating internal lines), we can divide by 190 to get the probability.\n**5. The Challenge:**\nThe most challenging part is determining how many pairs of vertices form internal lines. It's difficult to do this directly without a more sophisticated understanding of the dodecahedron's geometry.  \n**Conclusion:**\nWhile we've outlined the strategy, determining the actual probability requires a more detailed analysis of the dodecahedron's structure. This might involve:\n* **Geometric Arguments:**  Using geometric relationships between vertices, faces, and edges.\n* **Computer Simulation:**  A program could randomly generate pairs of vertices and determine if the connecting line is internal or external.  \nLet me know if you'd like to explore any of these approaches further. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Understand the Problem**\nWe need to find the probability that a randomly chosen line segment connecting two vertices of a dodecahedron lies entirely *inside* the dodecahedron. This means the line cannot pass through any faces or edges.\n**2. Visualize the Dodecahedron**\nImagine a regular dodecahedron.  Its 20 vertices are arranged in a symmetrical pattern.  \n**3. Identify Valid and Invalid Lines**\n* **Valid Lines:**  Lines that connect two vertices and lie entirely inside the dodecahedron.  Think of these lines as connecting vertices that are \"close enough\" to each other.\n* **Invalid Lines:** Lines that connect two vertices but pass through a face or edge of the dodecahedron.\n**4. Counting Invalid Lines**\nIt's easier to count the invalid lines first.  Consider a single vertex. How many other vertices can you connect it to with a line that goes *outside* the dodecahedron?\n* Imagine drawing lines from this vertex to its immediate neighbors.  These lines are valid.\n* Now, consider drawing lines to vertices that are \"one step away\" from the immediate neighbors. These lines will go through a face of the dodecahedron, so they are invalid.\n* You can continue this pattern: lines to vertices that are \"two steps away\" are also invalid, and so on. \n**5. Determine the Pattern**\nNotice that for each vertex, there's a set of neighboring vertices that form a pentagon (one of the faces of the dodecahedron).  You can connect a vertex to any vertex outside of this pentagon, and the line will be invalid.\n**6. Calculate the Number of Invalid Lines**\n* Since the dodecahedron has 20 vertices, and each vertex has 10 invalid connections (20 total vertices - 10 immediate neighbors), there are 20 * 10 = 200 invalid lines.\n**7. Calculate the Number of Total Lines**\nThe total number of possible lines you can draw between any two vertices is given by combinations: 20 choose 2, which is 20! / (2! * 18!) = 190.\n**8. Calculate the Probability**\nThe probability of choosing a valid line is the number of valid lines divided by the total number of lines:\n* Valid lines: 190 - 200 = -10 \n* Since we can't have a negative number of valid lines, this means all possible lines are invalid.\n**9. Final Answer**\nThe probability that the line connecting two randomly chosen vertices lies inside the dodecahedron is **0**. \n",
