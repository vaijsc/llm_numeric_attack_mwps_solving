        "Here's how to calculate the expected winnings:\n**1. Define the Outcomes and Probabilities:**\n* **Heads (H):** Probability = 3/5, Winnings = $4\n* **Tails (T):** Probability = 1/5, Winnings = -$1 (loss)\n* **Edge (E):** Probability = 1/5, Winnings = -$10 (loss)\n**2. Calculate the Expected Value for Each Outcome:**\n* **Expected Value of Heads:** (3/5) * $4 = $2.40\n* **Expected Value of Tails:** (1/5) * -$1 = -$0.20\n* **Expected Value of Edge:** (1/5) * -$10 = -$2.00\n**3. Sum the Expected Values:**\nExpected Winnings = $2.40 - $0.20 - $2.00 = $0.20\n**Answer:** The expected winnings from one flip are approximately **$0.20**. \n",
