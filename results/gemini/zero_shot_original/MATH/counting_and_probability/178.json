    "solution": "If we want the largest such $n$, we must count the number of factors of 3 in the prime factorization of $200!$. The number of multiples of 3 is $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{3} \\right\\rfloor$.  (The notation $\\left\\lfloor x\\right\\rfloor$ means the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$, so basically, $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{3}\\right\\rfloor$ means ``divide 200 by 3 and round down.\")   However, these are not the only factors of 3 in the product!  Multiples of 9 in the product contribute an extra factor of 3. There are $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{9} \\right\\rfloor$ of these, so we add this number to the $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{3}\\right\\rfloor$ factors of 3 we found from counting multiples of 3.  Similarly, we must add in multiples of 27 once and multiples of 81.\n\nThe sum is $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{3} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{9} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{27} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{81} \\right\\rfloor = 66 + 22 + 7 + 2 = \\boxed{97}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**Understanding the Problem**\n* **Factorial:**  The factorial of a non-negative integer *n*, denoted by *n*!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to *n*. For example, 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.\n* **Divisibility:** A number *a* is a factor of another number *b* if *b* is divisible by *a* (meaning there's no remainder when you divide *b* by *a*).\n**Finding the Greatest Power of 3**\nTo find the greatest power of 3 that divides 200!, we need to count how many times the factor 3 appears in the prime factorization of 200!.\n**Method:**\n1. **Count multiples of 3:**  There are 66 multiples of 3 between 1 and 200 (200/3 = 66 with some remainder). Each of these contributes at least one factor of 3.\n2. **Count multiples of 9:** There are 22 multiples of 9 between 1 and 200 (200/9 = 22 with some remainder). Each of these contributes an *additional* factor of 3 (since 9 = 3 * 3).\n3. **Count multiples of 27:** There are 7 multiples of 27 between 1 and 200 (200/27 = 7 with some remainder). Each of these contributes an *additional* factor of 3. \n4. **Continue:**  Keep going, counting multiples of 81, 243, etc., until you reach a multiple of 3 that is greater than 200.\n**Calculations:**\n* Multiples of 3: 66\n* Multiples of 9: 22\n* Multiples of 27: 7\n* Multiples of 81: 2\n**Sum:** 66 + 22 + 7 + 2 = 97\n**Answer:**\nThe greatest positive integer *n* such that 3^n is a factor of 200! is **n = 97**. \n",
