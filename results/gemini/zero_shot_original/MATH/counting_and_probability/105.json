    "problem": "How many different bracelets have 3 identical orange beads, 3 identical black beads, and 1 teal bead, if rotating or flipping a bracelet does not change it?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Rotate each bracelet so the teal bead is at the top. If we flip a bracelet over, leaving the teal bead in place, the three beads on the left flip to the right, and vice-versa. We can flip all of the bracelets so there are more orange beads on the left than on the right, since there are an odd number of orange beads total. If there are 2 orange beads on the left, there are three choices for the position of the black bead on the left and 3 for the position of the orange bead on the right, making 9 bracelets. If all three beads on the left are orange, we get one more bracelet, for a total of $9+1=\\boxed{10}$ bracelets.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1.  Imagine the beads in a line:**\n* If we just arrange the beads in a line, we have 7 positions to fill.  We can place the teal bead in any of these positions. \n* After placing the teal bead, there are 6 positions left for the orange beads.  We can choose 3 of these positions for the orange beads.\n* The remaining 3 positions are automatically filled with the black beads.\n**2. Calculate the number of linear arrangements:**\n*  There are 7 ways to choose a spot for the teal bead.\n* There are  \u2076C\u2083 = (6 * 5 * 4) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 20 ways to choose spots for the orange beads.\nSo, there are 7 * 20 = 140 possible linear arrangements.\n**3. Account for rotations and flips:**\n* **Rotations:** Since we're dealing with a bracelet, rotating the beads doesn't change the bracelet. We've overcounted by a factor of 7 (the number of positions the teal bead can occupy).\n* **Flips:**  Flipping the bracelet also doesn't change it. We've overcounted by a factor of 2 (since we can flip the bracelet horizontally).\n**4. Divide to find the unique bracelets:**\nTo get the number of unique bracelets, we divide the number of linear arrangements by the overcounting factors:\n140 / (7 * 2) = 10\n**Therefore, there are 10 different bracelets possible.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1.  Imagine the beads in a line:**\n* We have 7 beads total: OOO BBB T \n* There are 7!/(3!3!1!) = 140 ways to arrange these beads in a line.\n**2. Account for Rotations:**\n* Since we're dealing with a bracelet, rotating the beads doesn't change the bracelet.  Think of the bracelet as a circle.  Every arrangement has 7 different rotations that are identical.\n* Divide the number of linear arrangements by 7: 140 / 7 = 20\n**3. Account for Flips:**\n* Flipping the bracelet also doesn't change it. \n* We need to divide the number of arrangements by 2 to account for this symmetry. \n* However, there's a catch! Notice that some of our arrangements are already symmetrical (like OOO T BBB). These arrangements only have one flip that's different (the original arrangement).  We've already counted these once.  We only need to divide by 2 for the arrangements that are *not* symmetrical.\n* There are 20 arrangements, and half of them (10) are symmetrical.  We divide the remaining 10 arrangements by 2. \n**4. Calculate the final answer:**\n* The final number of unique bracelets is: (10 / 2) + 10 = 15\n**Therefore, there are 15 different bracelets possible.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Total Arrangements Without Restrictions**\n* Imagine the beads are all unique.  We have 7 beads in total, so there are 7! (7 factorial) ways to arrange them.\n* 7! = 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 5040\n**2. Account for Identical Beads**\n* Since the orange beads are identical, we've overcounted by a factor of 3! (3 factorial) because any arrangement of the orange beads looks the same.\n* Similarly, we've overcounted by a factor of 3! for the black beads.\n**3. Calculate the Number of Distinct Arrangements**\n* Divide the total number of arrangements by the number of times we've overcounted: 5040 / (3! * 3!) = 5040 / (6 * 6) = 5040 / 36 = 140\n**4. Account for Rotations and Flipping**\n* We've still overcounted because rotations and flips of the bracelet create identical arrangements.\n* Since we have 7 beads, there are 7 different rotations of the bracelet that produce the same arrangement. \n* We also need to account for flipping, which doubles the overcounting.\n**5. Final Calculation**\n* Divide the number of distinct arrangements by the number of rotations and flips: 140 / (7 * 2) = 140 / 14 = 10\n**Therefore, there are 10 different bracelets possible.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Consider all arrangements without restrictions:**\n* Imagine the beads are all unique. We have 7 beads, so there are 7! = 5040 ways to arrange them in a line.\n**2. Account for identical beads:**\n* Since the orange beads are identical, we've overcounted by a factor of 3! (the number of ways to arrange 3 identical objects).\n* Similarly, we've overcounted for the black beads by a factor of 3!.\n**3. Account for rotations:**\n* Imagine placing the beads in a circle. We can rotate the bracelet 7 times and get the same bracelet. So, we've overcounted by a factor of 7.\n**4. Account for flips:**\n* Since the bracelet is symmetrical, we can flip it and get the same bracelet. We've overcounted by a factor of 2.\n**5. Calculate the final number of distinct bracelets:**\n* Divide the initial number of arrangements by the overcounting factors:\n   (7!)/(3! * 3! * 7 * 2) = (5040) / (6 * 6 * 14) = **10**\n**Therefore, there are 10 different bracelets possible.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Total Arrangements (Ignoring Rotations and Flips):**\n* We have 7 beads in total.\n* If all the beads were unique, we'd have 7! (7 factorial) ways to arrange them.\n* However, we have repetitions: 3 orange beads, 3 black beads.\n* To correct for these repetitions, we divide by 3! (for the orange beads) and 3! (for the black beads).\n**Total Arrangements:** 7! / (3! * 3!) = 5040 / (6 * 6) = 140\n**2. Accounting for Rotations:**\n* Imagine fixing one bead (let's say the teal bead) in a position.\n* Each rotation of the bracelet results in the same arrangement.\n* Since there are 7 beads, there are 7 possible rotations that lead to the same bracelet.\n**Unique Arrangements After Rotation:** 140 / 7 = 20\n**3. Accounting for Flips:**\n* Now, consider flipping the bracelet. \n* If the arrangement is symmetrical, flipping it will result in the same bracelet.\n* In this case, there is only one way to flip the bracelet that results in a different arrangement (flip it along the line through the teal bead and one of the other beads). \n**Unique Arrangements After Rotations and Flips:**\n* Since we've already accounted for rotations, we only need to divide by 2 (for the flip). \n* However, since only half of the arrangements are symmetrical (and thus flipped to the same thing), we only divide by 2 for those symmetrical arrangements.\n* This means we'll have 10 unique arrangements that are symmetrical and 10 unique arrangements that are not.\n**Final Answer:**\nThere are **10** different bracelets possible with 3 orange beads, 3 black beads, and 1 teal bead when rotations and flips are considered. \n"
