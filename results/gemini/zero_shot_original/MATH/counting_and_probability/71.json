    "problem": "In how many ways can 8 people sit around a round table if 3 of the people -- Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas -- all want to sit together?  (Two seatings are considered the same if one is a rotation of the other.)",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "First choose three consecutive seats for Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas.  It doesn't matter which three consecutive seats that we choose, since any three such seats can be rotated to any other such seats.  Once the three seats are chosen, there are $3!$ ways to seat the three friends there.  The other five seats are for the other five people, so there are $5!$ ways to seat them there.  The answer is $3! \\times 5! = \\boxed{720}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Treat the group of three as one unit**\nSince Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas want to sit together, consider them as a single unit. Now, we have 6 entities to arrange around the table: the group of three and the other 5 people.\n**2. Arrange the 6 entities**\nSince it's a circular arrangement, we fix one entity's position to avoid overcounting due to rotations.  There are (6-1)! = 5! = 120 ways to arrange these 6 entities.\n**3. Arrange the three people within their group**\nThe three people within the group can be arranged in 3! = 6 ways.\n**4. Combine the arrangements**\nTo get the total number of ways to arrange all 8 people, we multiply the number of ways to arrange the groups by the number of ways to arrange the people within the group:\n120 ways (for the 6 entities) * 6 ways (for the group of 3) = **720 ways**\n**Therefore, there are 720 ways to arrange the 8 people around the table if Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas must sit together.** \n",

Now we have 6 \"units\" to arrange around the table: the group of three and the other 5 individuals.\n**2. Arrange the units:**\n* There are (6-1)! = 5! = 120 ways to arrange 6 distinct units around a circular table.  (We subtract 1 because rotations of the same arrangement are considered identical).\n**3. Arrange within the group:**\n* Within the group of three, there are 3! = 6 ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas.\n**4. Combine the arrangements:**\nTo get the total number of arrangements, multiply the number of ways to arrange the units by the number of ways to arrange the people within the group:\n120 ways (for the units) * 6 ways (for the group) = **720 ways**\n**Therefore, there are 720 ways to seat the 8 people around the table if Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas must sit together.** \n",

Now we have 6 \"people\" to arrange: 5 individuals and the group of 3.\n**2. Arrange the 6 units:**\n* There are 5! = 120 ways to arrange 6 distinct items in a line. \n* However, since we're dealing with a circular table, we need to account for rotations.  Each arrangement is identical to 5 other rotations.  \n* Therefore, there are 120 / 5 = 24 ways to arrange the 6 units around the table.\n**3. Arrange the people within the group:**\n* The three people within the group (Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas) can be arranged in 3! = 6 ways.\n**4. Combine the arrangements:**\n* To get the total number of arrangements, we multiply the number of ways to arrange the groups by the number of ways to arrange the people within the group: 24 * 6 = **144**.\n**Therefore, there are 144 ways to seat the 8 people around the table if Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas must sit together.** \n",
