    "solution": "If the four-digit integer is to be a palindrome, then the third digit must be the same as the second and the fourth must be the same as the first.  So, once we choose the first two digits, we can only form the palindrome in one way. There are 4 choices for the first digit and 4 choices for the second digit, so there are $4 \\times 4 = \\boxed{16}$ such integers.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understanding Palindromes**\nA four-digit palindrome has the form ABBA, where A and B are digits.\n**2. Choosing the First Two Digits**\n* We have four choices for the first digit (A): 2, 3, 4, or 5.\n* Once we've chosen the first digit, we have four choices for the second digit (B) as well.\n**3. The Last Two Digits are Determined**\n* The third digit must be the same as the second digit (B) to make it a palindrome.\n* The fourth digit must be the same as the first digit (A).\n**4. Calculating the Total Number of Palindromes**\nSince we have 4 choices for the first digit and 4 choices for the second digit, the total number of palindromes is:\n4 choices * 4 choices = **16 palindromes** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand Palindromes**\nA palindrome reads the same backward as forward.  For a four-digit palindrome, the first and last digits must be the same, and the second and third digits must be the same.\n**2.  Consider the Choices**\n* **First and Last Digits:** We have 4 choices (2, 3, 4, or 5) for the first and last digits.\n* **Second and Third Digits:**  We also have 4 choices (2, 3, 4, or 5) for the second and third digits.\n**3. Calculate the Possibilities**\nSince our choices are independent, we multiply the possibilities together:\n4 choices (first digit) * 4 choices (second digit) = 16 possible palindromes\n**Therefore, there are 16 four-digit palindromes that can be formed using the digits 2, 3, 4, and 5.** \n",
