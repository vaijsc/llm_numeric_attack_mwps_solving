    "problem": "Today a father's age is five times his son's age. Exactly three years ago, the sum of their ages was 30. How old is the son today?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let $x$ be the son's age today and his father's age $y$.  We know: $5x = y$, and that $(x -3) + (y -3) = 30$.  Substituting the first equation into the second, we get: $6x = 36$, and thus, $x=\\boxed{6}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Define Variables:**\n* Let 'x' represent the son's current age.\n* The father's current age is 5x.\n**2. Set up Equations:**\n* **Today:**  Father's age (5x) + Son's age (x) = Total age today\n* **Three Years Ago:** (Father's age - 3) + (Son's age - 3) = 30\n**3. Solve the Equations:**\n* **Equation 1:** 5x + x = Total age today\n* **Equation 2:** (5x - 3) + (x - 3) = 30\n**4. Simplify Equation 2:**\n* 6x - 6 = 30\n* 6x = 36\n**5. Solve for x (Son's Age):**\n* x = 36 / 6\n* x = 6\n**Therefore, the son is 6 years old today.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**Let's use variables:**\n* Let the son's current age be \"s\"\n* Let the father's current age be \"f\"\n**Set up equations based on the given information:**\n* **Today:**  f = 5s  (The father's age is five times the son's age)\n* **Three years ago:** (f - 3) + (s - 3) = 30  (The sum of their ages three years ago was 30)\n**Now we can solve for \"s\" (the son's age):**\n1. **Simplify the second equation:** f + s - 6 = 30\n2. **Combine like terms:** f + s = 36\n3. **Substitute the value of \"f\" from the first equation into the second equation:** 5s + s = 36\n4. **Combine like terms:** 6s = 36\n5. **Solve for \"s\":** s = 6\n**Therefore, the son is 6 years old today.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this word problem step-by-step:\n**1. Define Variables:**\n* Let  'x' represent the son's current age.\n* The father's current age is '5x' (five times the son's age).\n**2. Set Up Equations Based on the Information:**\n* **Today:**  The father's age is 5x, and the son's age is x.\n* **Three years ago:** The father's age was (5x - 3), and the son's age was (x - 3).\n**3. Formulate the Equation:**\nThe problem states that three years ago, the sum of their ages was 30. So, we can write the equation:\n(5x - 3) + (x - 3) = 30\n**4. Solve the Equation:**\n* Combine like terms: 6x - 6 = 30\n* Add 6 to both sides: 6x = 36\n* Divide both sides by 6: x = 6\n**Answer:** The son is currently **6 years old**. \n",
