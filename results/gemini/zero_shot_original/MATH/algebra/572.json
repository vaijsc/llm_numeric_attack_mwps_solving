        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Graph the Inequalities**\n* **y \u2265 |x|:** This represents the region above and including the V-shaped graph of the absolute value function. \n* **y \u2264 -|x| + 3:** This represents the region below and including the upside-down V-shaped graph of the absolute value function, shifted upward by 3 units.\n**2. Identify the Overlapping Region**\nThe solution to the system of inequalities is the region where the shaded areas of both inequalities overlap.  This region will be a diamond shape.\n**3. Find the Area**\n* **Base:** The base of the diamond is the distance between the x-intercepts of the two lines.  The x-intercepts of y = |x| are (-1, 0) and (1, 0). The x-intercepts of y = -|x| + 3 are (-3, 0) and (3, 0). So the base of the diamond is 3 - (-3) = 6 units.\n* **Height:** The height of the diamond is the distance between the y-intercepts of the two lines. The y-intercept of y = |x| is (0, 0). The y-intercept of y = -|x| + 3 is (0, 3). So the height of the diamond is 3 - 0 = 3 units.\n**4. Calculate the Area**\nThe area of a diamond is (1/2) * base * height.  Therefore, the area of this diamond is (1/2) * 6 * 3 = 9 square units.\n**Answer:** There are **9.0** square units in the region satisfying the inequalities. \n",

Calculate the Area**\nThe area of a diamond is (1/2) * base * height.  Therefore, the area of the shaded region is:\n(1/2) * 2 * 2 = **2 square units**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Graph the inequalities:**\n* **y \u2265 |x|:** This is a V-shaped graph with its vertex at the origin.  The region satisfying this inequality is above the graph.\n* **y \u2264 -|x| + 3:** This is also a V-shaped graph, but it's upside down and shifted up 3 units. The region satisfying this inequality is below the graph.\n**2. Find the intersection points:**\nThe region we're interested in is where the two shaded regions overlap. This happens where the two graphs intersect.  To find these points, set the equations equal to each other:\n|x| = -|x| + 3\nSince the absolute value of any number is always positive, there's no solution where x is positive.  Therefore, we can assume x is negative. This simplifies the equation to:\n-x = x + 3\nSolving for x, we get x = -3/2.  Substitute this back into either equation to find the corresponding y-value:\ny = |-3/2| = 3/2\nSo, the two intersection points are (-3/2, 3/2) and (3/2, 3/2).\n**3. Visualize the region:**\nThe region we're looking at is a diamond shape with its vertices at (0,0), (-3/2, 3/2), (3/2, 3/2), and (0, 3).\n**4. Calculate the area:**\n* **Base:** The base of the diamond is 3 (the distance between the points (-3/2, 3/2) and (3/2, 3/2)).\n* **Height:** The height of the diamond is 3/2 (the distance between the points (0,0) and (0, 3)).\n* **Area:** The area of a diamond is (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 3 * (3/2) = 9/4 = 2.25\n**Therefore, there are 2.25 square units in the region satisfying the given inequalities.** \n",

Identify the overlapping region:**\nThe solution to the system of inequalities is the region where the shaded areas overlap.  This is a triangular region.\n**4. Find the base and height of the triangle:**\n* **Base:** The base of the triangle is the distance between the x-intercepts of the two lines.  The x-intercepts are at x = 1 and x = -1, so the base has length 2. \n* **Height:** The height of the triangle is the vertical distance between the two lines at x = 0.  At x = 0, y = 0 for the first line and y = 3 for the second line, so the height is 3.\n**5. Calculate the area:**\nThe area of a triangle is (1/2) * base * height.  Therefore, the area of the overlapping region is (1/2) * 2 * 3 = **3 square units**. \n",
