        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Solve for one variable in terms of the other:**\n* We can solve the second equation (n + m = 1) for 'n':\n   n = 1 - m\n**2. Substitute the expression for 'n' into the first equation:**\n* Substitute (1 - m) for 'n' in the equation 3n + m = 14:\n   3(1 - m) + m = 14\n**3. Simplify and solve for 'm':**\n* Distribute the 3: 3 - 3m + m = 14\n* Combine like terms: 3 - 2m = 14\n* Subtract 3 from both sides: -2m = 11\n* Divide both sides by -2: m = -11/2\n**4. Substitute the value of 'm' back into the equation for 'n':**\n* n = 1 - m\n* n = 1 - (-11/2)\n* n = 13/2\n**5. Calculate n - m:**\n* n - m = (13/2) - (-11/2)\n* n - m = 24/2\n* n - m = 12\n**Therefore, the value of n - m is 12.** \n",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n1. **Solve for one variable:**  We can use elimination to solve for one of the variables.  Subtract the second equation from the first equation:\n   (3n + m) - (n + m) = 14 - 1\n   This simplifies to 2n = 13\n2. **Solve for 'n':** Divide both sides by 2:\n   n = 13/2\n3. **Substitute to find 'm':** Plug the value of 'n' back into either of the original equations.
