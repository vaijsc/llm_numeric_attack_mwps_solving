    "problem": "An airplane climbs 100 feet during the first second after takeoff.  In each succeeding second it climbs 100 feet more than it climbed during the previous second.  How many  seconds does it take for the plane to reach an altitude of   12,000 feet above its takeoff height?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "After $t$ seconds, the airplane's altitude (in feet) is $100 + 200 + \\dots + 100t = 100(1 + 2 + \\dots + t) = 100 \\cdot t(t + 1)/2 = 50t(t + 1)$.  Thus, we want to find the smallest $t$ such that $50t(t + 1) \\ge 12000$.  Dividing both sides by 50, we get \\[t(t + 1) \\ge 240.\\] Since $15 \\cdot 16 = 240$, the smallest such $t$ is $t = \\boxed{15}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Understand the Pattern:**\n* The airplane's climb forms an arithmetic sequence: 100, 200, 300, ... \n* Each term is 100 more than the previous term.\n**2. Find the Formula:**\n* The sum of an arithmetic series is given by: S = (n/2)(a + l)\n    *  S = sum of the series\n    *  n = number of terms \n    *  a = first term \n    *  l = last term\n**3. Apply the Formula:**\n* We want to find 'n' (the number of seconds) when S = 12,000 feet, a = 100 feet, and we need to find 'l'.\n**4. Find the Last Term ('l'):**\n* We don't know the last term directly, but we know the plane climbs 100 feet more each second. So, if it takes 'n' seconds, the last term 'l' will be: l = 100 + 100(n-1)\n**5. Set up the Equation:**\n* Substitute the values into the sum formula: 12000 = (n/2) (100 + [100 + 100(n-1)])\n**6. Solve for 'n':**\n* Simplify the equation: 12000 = (n/2)(200 + 100n - 100)\n* Further simplification: 12000 = (n/2)(100n + 100)\n* Divide both sides by 50: 240 = n(n + 1)\n* Expand: 240 = n\u00b2 + n\n* Rearrange into a quadratic: n\u00b2 + n - 240 = 0\n* Factor: (n + 16)(n - 15) = 0\n* Solve for n: n = -16 or n = 15\n**7. Choose the Valid Solution:**\n* Since time cannot be negative, we discard n = -16.\n* Therefore, it takes **15 seconds** for the plane to reach an altitude of 12,000 feet. \n",
