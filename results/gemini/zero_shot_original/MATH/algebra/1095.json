        "Here's how we can solve this problem:\n**Understanding Geometric Sequences**\nA geometric sequence is a sequence of numbers where each term is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant value called the common ratio. \n**Setting Up the Problem**\nWe know that the numbers *a*, *b*, and 2009 form a geometric sequence. This means there's an integer common ratio, let's call it *r*, such that:\n*  *b* = *a* *r* \n*  2009 = *b* *r*\n**Solving for *a***\n1. **Substitute:** Since we want to find *a*, let's substitute the first equation into the second equation:\n   * 2009 = (*a* *r*) *r*\n   * 2009 = *a* *r*\u00b2\n2. **Prime Factorization:**  Now, we need to find the prime factorization of 2009 to help us determine the possible values for *a* and *r*:\n   * 2009 = 7\u00b2 * 41\n3. **Consider the Factors:** Since *a* and *r*\u00b2 must multiply to 2009, the only possible values for *a* are the factors of 2009 that are less than 2009:\n   *  *a* could be 1, 7, or 49 \n4. **Check the Ratios:** Let's see if these values of *a* result in an integer common ratio:\n   * If *a* = 1, then *r*\u00b2 = 2009, which means *r* is not an integer.\n   * If *a* = 7, then *r*\u00b2 = 287, which means *r* is not an integer.\n   * If *a* = 49, then *r*\u00b2 = 41, which means *r* = \u221a41, which is not an integer.\n**Conclusion**\nNone of the possible values for *a* result in an integer common ratio. This means there are **no** positive integers *a*, *b*, and 2009 that form a geometric sequence with an integer ratio. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**Understanding Geometric Sequences**\n* A geometric sequence is a sequence where each term is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant value called the common ratio. \n* If the first term is *a* and the common ratio is *r*, then the sequence looks like this:  *a*, *ar*, *ar\u00b2*, *ar\u00b3*, ...\n**Setting Up the Problem**\nWe know that the terms *a*, *b*, and 2009 form a geometric sequence.  Let's assume the common ratio is *r*. This means:\n*  *a* = the first term\n*  *b* = *ar* (the second term)\n*  2009 = *ar\u00b2* (the third term)\n**Solving for the Common Ratio (r)**\n1. **Divide the third term by the second term:** \n   * 2009 / *b* = *ar\u00b2* / *ar* = *r* \n   * Therefore, *r* = 2009 / *b*\n2. **Divide the second term by the first term:**\n   * *b* / *a* = *ar* / *a* = *r*\n   * Therefore, *r* = *b* / *a*\n3. **Equate the two expressions for r:**\n   * 2009 / *b* = *b* / *a*\n4. **Solve for *a*:**\n   * 2009 *a* = *b\u00b2*\n   * *a* = *b\u00b2* / 2009\n**Finding the Value of b**\n* Since *a* and *b* are integers,  *b\u00b2* must be a multiple of 2009.  \n* We need to find the largest perfect square that divides 2009. \n* Notice that 2009 is a prime number.  This means the only perfect square that divides 2009 is 1.\n* Therefore, *b\u00b2* = 1, and *b* = 1.\n**Finding the Value of a**\n* Now that we know *b* = 1, we can substitute into the equation for *a*:\n   * *a* = *b\u00b2* / 2009 = 1\u00b2/2009 = **1/2009** \n**The Answer**\nSince *a* must be a positive integer, there are **no solutions** to this problem.  The conditions of the problem are impossible to satisfy. \n",

Understand Geometric Sequences**\nA geometric sequence is a sequence where each term is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant value called the common ratio.\n**2. Set up the Equation**\nSince the numbers form a geometric sequence, we know:\n*  *b* is the geometric mean of *a* and 2009. This means:  *b*\u00b2 = *a* * 2009 \n**3. Find the Common Ratio**\n* The common ratio, *r*, is the ratio between consecutive terms: *r* = *b*/ *a* = 2009/ *b*.\n**4.  Combine the Equations**\nWe have two equations and two unknowns (*a* and *b*).  We can solve for *a* by substituting the expression for *r* into the equation for *b*\u00b2:\n* *b*\u00b2 = *a* * 2009\n* ( *a* * *r* )\u00b2 = *a* * 2009 \n* *a*\u00b2 * *r*\u00b2 = *a* * 2009\n**5. Simplify and Solve**\n* Since *r* = 2009/ *b*, substitute: *a*\u00b2 * (2009/ *b*)\u00b2 = *a* * 2009\n* Simplify: *a*\u00b2 * 2009\u00b2 = *a* * 2009 * *b*\u00b2\n* Divide both sides by *a* * 2009 (note: we can do this because *a* and *b* are positive integers, so they cannot be zero):  *a* * 2009 = *b*\u00b2 \n* Substitute *b*\u00b2 from the first equation: *a* * 2009 = *a* * 2009\n* This equation is always true, which means there are many solutions!\n**6. Find the Smallest Solution**\nSince we want the smallest possible value of *a*, we need to find the smallest integer *a* that makes *b*\u00b2 = *a* * 2009 an integer.  We can do this by factoring 2009.\n* 2009 is prime, so the only factors are 1 and 2009.\n*  Therefore, the smallest possible value for *a* is **1**.\n**Conclusion**\nThe smallest possible value for *a* is **1**. \n",

Setting up the Equation**\nSince $a$, $b$, and 2009 form a geometric sequence, we can write:\n*  $b = ar$ (where 'r' is the common ratio)\n*  $2009 = br = a(r^2)$\n**3. Finding the Ratio**\nWe need to find the integer value of 'r'.  Notice that 2009 is a prime number. This means its only factors are 1 and itself. Since 'a' and 'b' are both smaller than 2009, the common ratio 'r' must be 1. \n**4. Solving for 'a'**\nIf 'r' = 1, then:\n*  $b = a * 1 = a$ \n*  $2009 = a * 1^2 = a$\n**5. The Answer**\nSince 'a' must be less than 'b', and 'b' is equal to 'a', the only possible value for 'a' is **1**. \n",

Finding the Common Ratio**\nWe need to find the factors of 2009 to determine possible values for the common ratio 'r'.  The prime factorization of 2009 is 7 x 17 x 17.  \nSince the ratio 'r' must be an integer, it can only be 7, 17, or a combination of those factors.\n* **If r = 7:**  Then $a = 2009/r^2 = 2009/49$, which is not an integer.\n* **If r = 17:** Then $a = 2009/r^2 = 2009/289 = 7$, which is an integer.\n**4. Finding the Value of 'a'**\nWe found that a common ratio of 17 works, and it gives us $a = 7$. \n**Answer:** The value of $a$ is **7**. \n"
