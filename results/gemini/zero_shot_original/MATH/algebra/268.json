    "solution": "Find the sum of the weights of a green and a red ball.\n\nAs before, we have $5g + 2r =10$ and $g+4r=7.$ Before solving this system of equations, we note that we seek $8g+8r,$ which equals $8(g+r).$  So, if we can find $g+r,$ we can find the total weight of the balls $\\emph{without finding the weight of each ball}.$ Looking at our equations, we see a total of $6g$ and $6r$ on the left, so adding the two equations can get us to $g+r.$ Adding the equations gives $6g+6r = 17,$ and dividing both sides by $6$ gives $$g+r = \\frac{17}{6}.$$ Therefore, we have $$8g+8r= 8(g+r) = 8\\cdot\\frac{17}{6} = \\boxed{\\frac{68}{3}\\text{ pounds}}.$$",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Set up equations:**\n* Let  'g' represent the weight of one green ball.\n* Let 'r' represent the weight of one red ball.\nWe can translate the given information into equations:\n* Equation 1: 5g + 2r = 10  \n* Equation 2: g + 4r = 7\n**2. Solve for one variable:**\nWe can use either substitution or elimination to solve for one of the variables. Let's use elimination:\n* Multiply Equation 2 by -5: -5g - 20r = -35\n* Add this modified equation to Equation 1: \n   (5g + 2r = 10) + (-5g - 20r = -35)  \n   This simplifies to: -18r = -25\n* Solve for 'r': r = -25 / -18 = 1.39 (approximately)\n**3. Substitute to find the other variable:**\n* Substitute the value of 'r' (1.39) back into either Equation 1 or Equation 2. Let's use Equation 1:\n   5g + 2(1.39) = 10\n   5g + 2.78 = 10\n   5g = 7.22\n   g = 7.22 / 5 = 1.44 (approximately)\n**4. Calculate the total weight:**\n* We need to find the weight of 8 green balls and 8 red balls:\n   (8 green balls * 1.44 pounds/ball) + (8 red balls * 1.39 pounds/ball) = 11.52 + 11.12 = 22.64 pounds\n**Answer:** The weight of 8 red and 8 green balls together is approximately **22.64 pounds**. \n",
