        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the problem:**\nWe need to find two integers, A and B, that satisfy the following equation:\n(3x + A)(x + B) = 3x\u00b2 + 14x + 8\n**2.  Expand the left side:**\n(3x + A)(x + B) = 3x\u00b2 + (A + 3B)x + AB\n**3. Match coefficients:**\nWe need the coefficients of the expanded expression to match those of the original expression. This gives us two equations:\n* A + 3B = 14\n* AB = 8\n**4. Solve for A and B:**\n* **Solve for A in terms of B (or vice versa):** From the first equation, we get A = 14 - 3B.\n* **Substitute into the second equation:** (14 - 3B)B = 8\n* **Simplify and solve the quadratic:** 14B - 3B\u00b2 = 8  =>  3B\u00b2 - 14B + 8 = 0. This factors as (3B - 2)(B - 4) = 0, giving us B = 2/3 or B = 4. \n* **Since A and B are integers, B must be 4.**\n* **Substitute B = 4 into the equation A = 14 - 3B to find A:** A = 14 - 3(4) = 2.\n**5. Calculate A - B:**\nA - B = 2 - 4 = **-2** \n**Therefore, the value of A - B is -2.** \n",

Factor the Expression:**\n* We need to find two numbers that multiply to give 24 (3 * 8) and add up to 14. \n* The numbers 12 and 2 satisfy these conditions: 12 * 2 = 24 and 12 + 2 = 14.\n**2.
