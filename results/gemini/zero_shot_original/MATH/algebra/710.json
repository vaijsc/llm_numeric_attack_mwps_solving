    "solution": "If Dr. Jones has an income of $x$, then the amount of tax is essentially a piecewise function in $x$. In particular, if we let $t(x)$ denote the amount of taxes, then $t(x) = 0$ when $0 \\le x \\le 20000$. For $20000 \\le x \\le 45000$, he pays $$t(x) = 0.05 (x-20000).$$For $45000 \\le x \\le 80000$, he pays  \\begin{align*}\nt(x)& = 0.05(45000-20000) + 0.1(x - 45000)\\\\\n& = 1250 + x/10 - 4500.\n\\end{align*}For $80000 \\le x \\le 130000$ he pays  \\begin{align*}\nt(x) &= 1250 + 0.1(80000-45000) + 0.15(x - 80000)\\\\\n& = 4750 + 0.15x - 12000.\n\\end{align*}Finally, if $x \\ge 130000$, he pays  \\begin{align*}t(x) &= 4750 + 0.15(130000-80000) + 0.2(x - 130000)\\\\\n& = 12250 + 0.2(x - 130000).\\end{align*}We can immediately eliminate the last possibility, since then he would automatically pay at least $\\$12,250$ in taxes. If $x \\le 80000$, then $t(x) \\le 1250 + 80000/10 - 4500 = 4750$. Hence, $80000 \\le x \\le 130000$. Then, $$10000 = 4750 + 0.15x - 12000 \\Longrightarrow x = \\boxed{\\$115,000}.$$",

        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Calculate the tax from each bracket:**\n* **Bracket 1:**  $0 (no tax on the first $20,000)\n* **Bracket 2:**  $25,000 * 0.05 = $1,250 \n* **Bracket 3:** $35,000 * 0.10 = $3,500\n* **Bracket 4:** $50,000 * 0.15 = $7,500\n**2.  Determine how much tax is left to be accounted for:**\n* $10,000 (total tax) - $1,250 - $3,500 - $7,500 = -$2,250 \n**3.  Analyze the result:**\n* We have a negative result, which means Dr. Jones's total tax liability is *less* than $10,000.  This tells us he doesn't earn enough income to reach the 20% tax bracket.\n**4.  Calculate the income:**\n* To figure out Dr. Jones's income, we need to add up the income from each bracket until the tax liability reaches $10,000. \n* Since the tax liability is less than $10,000, we know Dr. Jones's income is within the first four brackets.\n**5.  Work backwards:**\n* We know the total tax paid is $10,000.\n* If we subtract the taxes from the first three brackets ($1,250 + $3,500 + $7,500 = $12,250), we get a negative value. This means Dr. Jones didn't reach the fourth bracket.\n* To reach the total tax of $10,000, he must have earned some of the income from the third bracket, but not all of it.\n**6.  Solve for the income in the third bracket:**\n* Let  'x' be the income in the third bracket.\n* We know the tax from the first two brackets is $1,250 + $3,500 = $4,750\n* The total tax from the third bracket should be $10,000 - $4,750 = $5,250\n* To find the income in the third bracket: \n    * $5,250 / 0.10 = $52,500 \n* However, the third bracket only goes up to $35,000.  This means Dr. Jones's income goes up to the end of the third bracket.\n**7.  Calculate Dr. Jones's total income:**\n* Total income = $20,000 + $25,000 + $35,000 = $80,000\n**Therefore, Dr. Jones makes $80,000.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Calculate the tax on the first three income brackets:**\n* **Bracket 1:** $0 (no tax on the first $20,000)\n* **Bracket 2:** $25,000 * 0.05 = $1,250 \n* **Bracket 3:** $35,000 * 0.10 = $3,500\n**2.  Calculate the total tax from the first three brackets:**\n* $0 + $1,250 + $3,500 = $4,750\n**3.  Determine the remaining tax to be paid:**\n* $10,000 (total tax) - $4,750 (tax on first three brackets) = $5,250 \n**4. Calculate the income in the fourth bracket (15% tax):**\n* $5,250 / 0.15 = $35,000\n**5. Calculate Dr. Jones' total income:**\n* $20,000 (bracket 1) + $25,000 (bracket 2) + $35,000 (bracket 3) + $35,000 (bracket 4) = **$115,000**\n**Therefore, Dr. Jones makes $115,000 in income.** \n",
        "Here's how to break down the problem to find Dr. Jones' income:\n**1. Analyze the Tax Brackets:**\n* **Bracket 1:** $0 - $20,000 (No tax)\n* **Bracket 2:** $20,001 - $45,000 (5% tax)\n* **Bracket 3:** $45,001 - $80,000 (10% tax)\n* **Bracket 4:** $80,001 - $130,000 (15% tax)\n* **Bracket 5:** $130,001+ (20% tax)\n**2. Calculate Tax Paid in Each Bracket:**\n* **Bracket 2:** $25,000 * 0.05 = $1,250\n* **Bracket 3:** $35,000 * 0.10 = $3,500\n**3. Determine the Remaining Tax:**\n* **Total Tax Paid So Far:** $1,250 + $3,500 = $4,750\n* **Remaining Tax:** $10,000 - $4,750 = $5,250\n**4. Calculate Income from the Remaining Tax:**\n* Since the remaining tax is $5,250, we know Dr. Jones is in the 15% tax bracket for some of his income.\n* **Income in Bracket 4:** $5,250 / 0.15 = $35,000 \n**5. Calculate Total Income:**\n* **Total Income:** $20,000 (Bracket 1) + $25,000 (Bracket 2) + $35,000 (Bracket 3) + $35,000 (Bracket 4) = **$115,000**\n**Therefore, Dr. Jones makes $115,000 in income.** \n",

Analyze the Result:**\nWe get a negative value for the tax paid in the highest bracket. This means Dr. Jones' total tax liability is less than the maximum possible tax he could owe based on his income falling within the lower brackets. Therefore, Dr. Jones' income must be within the range of $20,001 to $130,000.\n**5.  Calculate the Income:**\nSince Dr. Jones paid $10,000 in taxes and we know the maximum tax from the first four brackets is $12,250, he must have some income in the fifth bracket.  To figure this out, we need to see how much of the tax he paid was from the first four brackets.\n* We know he paid $10,000 in taxes, and the lower brackets total $12,250.  This means he actually *overpaid* the lower brackets by $2,250. This overpayment comes from the highest bracket. \n* Since the highest bracket is a 20% tax rate, and he overpaid by $2,250, he must have earned $2,250 / 0.20 = $11,250 in the highest bracket.\n* **Dr. Jones' total income:** $20,000 (Bracket 1) + $25,000 (Bracket 2) + $35,000 (Bracket 3) + $50,000 (Bracket 4) + $11,250 (Bracket 5) = **$141,250** \n**Therefore, Dr. Jones makes $141,250 in income.** \n"
