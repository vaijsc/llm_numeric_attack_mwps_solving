    "solution": "Setting the expressions for $g(x)$ given in the first two equations equal to each other gives us $3x+2=2f^{-1}(x)$, so $f^{-1}(x)=\\dfrac{3x+2}{2}$. Substituting $f(x)$ into our expression for $f^{-1}$, we get \\begin{align*}\n\\dfrac{3f(x)+2}{2}&=f^{-1}(f(x)) \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\dfrac{3f(x)+2}{2}&=x \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\quad 3f(x)&=2x-2 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\quad f(x)&=\\frac{2x-2}{3}.\n\\end{align*}Thus, $a=\\frac{2}{3}$ and $b=\\frac{-2}{3}$, so $\\dfrac{a+b}{2}=0/2=\\boxed{0}$.",

Find the inverse function f\u207b\u00b9(x):**\n* **Start with the equation for f(x):**  \n   y = ax + b\n* **Swap x and y:**\n   x = ay + b\n* **Solve for y:**\n   x - b = ay\n   y = (x - b)/a\n* **Replace y with f\u207b\u00b9(x):**\n   f\u207b\u00b9(x) = (x - b)/a\n**2.

Equate this expression for g(x) with the given definition g(x) = 3x + 2:**\n* (2x - 2b)/a = 3x + 2\n**4. Solve for a and b:**\n* To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by 'a':\n   2x - 2b = 3ax + 2a\n* Rearrange the terms to get 'x' terms on one side and constant terms on the other:\n   2x - 3ax = 2a + 2b\n* Factor out 'x':\n   x(2 - 3a) = 2a + 2b\n* For the equation to hold for all values of x, the coefficients of 'x' on both sides must be equal, and the constant terms must also be equal.  This gives us two equations:\n    * 2 - 3a = 0 \n    * 2a + 2b = 0\n**5. Solve for a and b:**\n* From the first equation, 3a = 2, so a = 2/3.\n* Substitute this value of a into the second equation: 2(2/3) + 2b = 0.\n* Simplify and solve for b: 4/3 + 2b = 0,  2b = -4/3, b = -2/3.\n**6. Calculate (a + b)/2:**\n* (a + b)/2 = [(2/3) + (-2/3)] / 2 = 0 / 2 = 0\n**Therefore, (a + b)/2 = 0** \n",
