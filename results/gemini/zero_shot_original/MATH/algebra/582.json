        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Get rid of the fractions:**\n* Multiply both sides of the equation by the least common multiple of the denominators, which is 117x:\n   \n   ```\n   117x * (9x/13 + 13/9x) = 117x * (250/117x)\n   ```\n* Simplify:\n   ```\n   81x^2 + 169 = 250\n   ```\n**2. Solve the quadratic equation:**\n* Subtract 250 from both sides:\n   ```\n   81x^2 - 81 = 0\n   ```\n* Factor out 81:\n   ```\n   81(x^2 - 1) = 0\n   ```\n* Factor the difference of squares:\n   ```\n   81(x + 1)(x - 1) = 0\n   ```\n* Solve for x:\n   ```\n   x + 1 = 0  or  x - 1 = 0\n   x = -1  or  x = 1\n   ```\n**3.
