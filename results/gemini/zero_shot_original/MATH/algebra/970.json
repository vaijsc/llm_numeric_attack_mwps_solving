        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Problem**\nWe want to find the values of *x* that make the expression  \u221a(63 - \u221a*x*) an integer.  This means the expression inside the outer square root must be a perfect square.\n**2. Set up an Equation**\nLet's say  \u221a(63 - \u221a*x*) = *n*, where *n* is an integer.  Squaring both sides gives us:\n63 - \u221a*x* = *n*\u00b2\n**3. Isolate the Square Root**\nRearranging the equation, we get:\n\u221a*x* = 63 - *n*\u00b2\n**4.  Consider the Restrictions**\n* **Non-negative:** The square root of a number cannot be negative.  Therefore, 63 - *n*\u00b2 \u2265 0. \n* **Integer:** We want \u221a*x* to be an integer, which means 63 - *n*\u00b2 must be a perfect square.\n**5.  Solve for *n***\nLet's find the possible values of *n* that satisfy the conditions:\n* **n = 0:**  63 - 0\u00b2 = 63 (not a perfect square)\n* **n = 1:** 63 - 1\u00b2 = 62 (not a perfect square)\n* **n = 2:** 63 - 2\u00b2 = 59 (not a perfect square)\n* **n = 3:** 63 - 3\u00b2 = 54 (not a perfect square)\n* **n = 4:** 63 - 4\u00b2 = 47 (not a perfect square)\n* **n = 5:** 63 - 5\u00b2 = 38 (not a perfect square)\n* **n = 6:** 63 - 6\u00b2 = 27 (not a perfect square)\n* **n = 7:** 63 - 7\u00b2 = 16 (a perfect square!)\n**6. Find the Corresponding Value of *x***\nSince *n* = 7 gives us a perfect square, we can find *x*:\n\u221a*x* = 63 - 7\u00b2 = 16\n*x* = 16\u00b2 = 256\n**7. Conclusion**\nThere is only **one** real value of *x* that makes \u221a(63 - \u221a*x*) an integer, and that value is *x* = 256. \n",

Working Backwards**\n* Since we want the entire expression to be an integer, let's start by considering what values of (63 - \u221a*x*) would result in a perfect square when taking the square root. \n* The perfect squares less than 63 are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49.\n**3. Solving for *x***\nLet's examine each of these perfect squares:\n* **If  (63 - \u221a*x*) = 1:**  \u221a*x* = 62, *x* = 3844\n* **If (63 - \u221a*x*) = 4:** \u221a*x* = 59, *x* = 3481\n* **If (63 - \u221a*x*) = 9:** \u221a*x* = 54, *x* = 2916\n* **If (63 - \u221a*x*) = 16:** \u221a*x* = 47, *x* = 2209\n* **If (63 - \u221a*x*) = 25:** \u221a*x* = 38, *x* = 1444\n* **If (63 - \u221a*x*) = 36:** \u221a*x* = 27, *x* = 729\n* **If (63 - \u221a*x*) = 49:** \u221a*x* = 14, *x* = 196\n**4. Checking for Validity**\nWe need to make sure that all these values of *x* result in a non-negative value under the radical in the original expression (\u221a(63 - \u221a*x*)).  All the values we found work.\n**5. The Answer**\nTherefore, there are **7** real values of *x* that make the expression \u221a(63 - \u221a*x*) an integer. \n",

Checking for Solutions:**\nFor each value of *k*, we can calculate *x* and see if it's a real solution:\n*x* = (63 - *k*\u00b2)\u00b2\nFor example, if *k* = 5, then *x* = (63 - 25)\u00b2 = 38\u00b2 = 1444. \nWe need to check all the values of *k* to see how many of them lead to real solutions for *x*.\n**7.
