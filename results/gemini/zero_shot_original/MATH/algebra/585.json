    "solution": "Putting the $x$ and $y$ terms of the second equation on the left gives $6x+15y = 16+a$. Multiplying the first equation by 3 gives $6x + 15y = -24$.  So, our system now is \\begin{align*} 6x+15y &= -24,\\\\ 6x + 15y&=16+a. \\end{align*}This system has infinitely many solutions only if the two right sides are the same, which would make the two equations the same.  So, we must have $-24 = 16+a$, so $a= \\boxed{-40}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Rewrite the system in standard form**\nThe second equation can be rewritten as:\n```\n6x + 15y = 16 + a\n```\nNow the system is:\n```\n2x + 5y = -8\n6x + 15y = 16 + a \n```\n**2. Recognize the relationship for infinitely many solutions**\nA system of equations has infinitely many solutions if the equations are *dependent*, meaning one equation is a multiple of the other. \n**3.  Check for dependency**\nNotice that the second equation is exactly 3 times the first equation.  To make them truly dependent, we need to ensure that the right-hand sides of the equations are also multiples. \n**4. Determine the value of 'a'**\nThe right-hand side of the first equation is -8.  To make the right-hand side of the second equation a multiple of -8, we need  16 + a to be divisible by -8.  The only value of 'a' that makes this true is:\n```\na = -24 \n```\n**5. Verification**\nIf  a = -24, the system becomes:\n```\n2x + 5y = -8\n6x + 15y = -8\n```\nThe second equation is now 3 times the first equation, confirming that the system has infinitely many solutions.\n**Answer:** The value of the constant *a* for which the system has infinitely many solutions is **a = -24**. \n",

Let's rewrite the second equation in this form:\n*  6x + 15y = 16 + a\n**2.  Recognize when a system has infinitely many solutions:**\nA system of equations has infinitely many solutions if the equations are essentially the same (they represent the same line).

Find the value of 'a':**\nFor the equations to represent the same line, the constant terms must also be in the same ratio.  The constant term in the first equation is -8.  To make the constant term in the second equation a multiple of -8, we need:\n* 16 + *a* = 3(-8) \n**5.

        "### Response:\nTo have infinitely many solutions, the two equations must represent the same line.  This means they must be multiples of each other.  Let's manipulate the second equation to see if we can make it a multiple of the first:\n1. **Rearrange the second equation:** \n   $$6x + 15y = 16 + a$$\n2. **Divide both sides of the second equation by 3:**\n   $$2x + 5y = \\frac{16 + a}{3}$$\nNow, we want the right-hand sides of both equations to be equal:\n$$-8 = \\frac{16 + a}{3}$$\n3. **Solve for *a*:**\n   \\begin{align*}\n   -24 &= 16 + a \\\\\n   a &= -24 - 16 \\\\\n   a &= \\boxed{-40}\n   \\end{align*}\nTherefore, the system of equations has infinitely many solutions when $a = -40$. \n",
