        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n1. **Identify 'a' and 'b':** In the expression $3 \\ast 10$, we have  $a = 3$ and $b = 10$.\n2. **Substitute the values into the formula:**  We're given the formula $a \\ast b = 2a + 5b - ab$.  Substitute the values of  $a$ and $b$:\n   \n   $3 \\ast 10 = (2 \\cdot 3) + (5 \\cdot 10) - (3 \\cdot 10)$\n3. **Simplify the expression:**  Calculate the products and then perform the addition and subtraction:\n   $3 \\ast 10 = 6 + 50 - 30$\n4. **Calculate the final result:**\n   $3 \\ast 10 = 26$\n**Therefore, the value of $3 \\ast 10$ is 26.** \n",
