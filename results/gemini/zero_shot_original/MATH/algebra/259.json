    "problem": "Paula invests $\\$10,\\!000$ for 5 years at an interest rate of $10\\%$ per year. If the interest is simple interest, how much is her investment worth at the end of those five years?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "If the interest is simple interest, then she earns $0.1(\\$10,\\!000) = \\$1,\\!000$ each year.  Therefore, at the end of 5 years, she has earned $5(\\$1,\\!000) = \\$5,\\!000$.  So, her investment is now worth $\\$10,\\!000 + \\$5,\\!000 = \\boxed{\\$15,\\!000}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Calculate the annual interest:**\n* Multiply the principal amount by the interest rate: $10,000 * 0.10 = $1,000\n**2. Calculate the total interest earned:**\n* Multiply the annual interest by the number of years: $1,000 * 5 = $5,000\n**3. Calculate the total value of the investment:**\n* Add the total interest earned to the original principal: $10,000 + $5,000 = $15,000\n**Answer:** Paula's investment will be worth $15,000 at the end of five years. \n",
