    "problem": "Jasmine drank 1.5 pints of water on the first 3 miles of her hike. If she continued at this rate, how many pints of water would she drink in the next 10 miles?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We can set up the ratios $\\frac{1.5}{3}=\\frac{x}{10}$, where $x$ is how many pints of water she'd drink in the next 10 miles. We cross-multiply to get $3x=1.5(10)=15$, which means $x=5$. Jasmine would drink $\\boxed{5}$ pints of water in the next 10 miles.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the water consumption per mile:**\n* Jasmine drank 1.5 pints in 3 miles.\n* Divide the total pints by the number of miles: 1.5 pints / 3 miles = 0.5 pints per mile\n**2. Calculate the water needed for the next 10 miles:**\n* Multiply the water consumption per mile by the distance: 0.5 pints/mile * 10 miles = 5 pints\n**Answer:** Jasmine would drink **5 pints** of water in the next 10 miles. \n",
