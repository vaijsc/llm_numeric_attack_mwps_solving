In summary, \\begin{align*}\\tag{1}\na+b&=16\\\\ \\tag{2}\na+c&=19\\\\ \\tag{3}\nb+d&=22\\\\ \\tag{4}\nc+d&=25\n\\end{align*} There are two sums left, $a+d$ and $b+c$. We will break this problem into two cases, the first case in which the first of the two sums is smaller than the second, and the second case in which the first of the two sums is larger than the second.\n\nIn the first case \\begin{align*} \\tag{5}\na+d&=20\\\\ \\tag{6}\nb+c&=21\n\\end{align*} Adding Equations (1) and (6) and subtracting (2), we have $(a+b)+(b+c)-(a+c)=16+21-19\\Rightarrow b = 9$. Plugging this value into Equation (1), we find that $a+9=16 \\Rightarrow a=7$. Plugging the value of $a$ into Equation (2), we find that $7+c=19 \\Rightarrow c=12$. Plugging the value of $c$ into Equation (4), we find that $12+d=25 \\Rightarrow d=13$. Thus, the four integers are $7,9,12,13$.\n\nIn the second case, \\begin{align*} \\tag{7}\nb+c&=20\\\\ \\tag{8}\na+d&=21\n\\end{align*} Adding Equations (1) and (7) and subtracting Equation (2), we have $(a+b)+(b+c)-(a+c)=16+20-19 \\Rightarrow b=8.5$. This case is impossible because $b$ is defined to be an integer.\n\nThus, the only solution is $\\boxed{7,9,12,13}$.\n\nAlternate solution: Again WLOG, assume $a<b<c<d$.  Then $a+b=16$ implies $b \\geq 9$, and $c+d=25$ implies $c \\leq 12$.  Since $a+b=16$ and $a+c=19$, $c-b=3$, and so we must have $b=9, c=12$.  Plugging back in, we get $a=7, d=13$, or $a,b,c,d = \\boxed{7,9,12,13}$",

        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1.  Understanding the Problem**\nWe have four distinct integers, and we know the sum of every possible pair of these integers. Our goal is to find the four integers.\n**2.  Finding the Sum of All Integers**\nNotice that each integer is part of three different pairs. Therefore, if we add all six given sums, we'll be adding each integer three times.  \n* Total sum of the six sums: 16 + 19 + 20 + 21 + 22 + 25 = 123\n* This total sum represents three times the sum of our four integers.\n* Sum of our four integers: 123 / 3 = 41\n**3.  Finding the Integers**\nLet's represent our four integers as *a*, *b*, *c*, and *d*, with *a* being the smallest and *d* being the largest. We know that:\n* *a + b + c + d = 41*\nNow, consider the smallest sum (16). This suggests that *a* and *b* must be relatively small. The largest sum (25) indicates that *c* and *d* must be relatively large. \nLet's try to form pairs:\n* **Pair with 25:**  The only way to get a sum of 25 with distinct integers is *c* + *d* = 25.\n* **Pair with 16:** Since *a* and *b* are the smallest integers, *a + b = 16*.\n* **Remaining Pairs:**  We have four more sums: 19, 20, 21, and 22. These must be formed by combining one integer from the {*a*, *b*} pair and one integer from the {*c*, *d*} pair. \nTo find the remaining integers, consider the differences between the sums and the known pairs:\n* 19 - 16 = 3 \n* 20 - 16 = 4\n* 21 - 16 = 5\n* 22 - 16 = 6\nThese differences represent the possible values of *c - a* or *d - b*. Since we need distinct integers, these differences should all be unique. \nNow we can deduce:\n* *c - a = 3*\n* *d - b = 4*\n* *c - b = 5* \n* *d - a = 6*\n**4.  Solving for the Integers**\nWe now have a system of equations.  Solving this system, we get:\n* *a = 4*\n* *b = 12*\n* *c = 7*\n* *d = 18*\n**5.  Answer**\nThe four integers in increasing order are: **4, 7, 12, 18** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1.  Pairing and Summing**\n* Notice that the sums 16, 19, 20, 21, 22, and 25  come in pairs with a difference of 3 (16 & 19, 20 & 23, 22 & 25). \n* This implies that two of the numbers must be involved in both sums of each pair. \n* Let's call these two numbers *x* and *y*.\n**2. Finding *x* and *y***\n* The average of 16 and 19 is 17.5, meaning *x* + *y* = 17.5 \n* The average of 20 and 23 is 21.5, meaning *x* + *y* = 21.5\nSince we have the same sum (*x* + *y*) equaling two different values, we know something is wrong! This means our initial assumption about the pairs being formed with the same two numbers must be incorrect.\n**3.  Adjusting our Approach**\nLet's focus on the largest sum (25) and the smallest sum (16).  \n* **25:**  The largest sum suggests that two of the largest numbers are being added.\n* **16:** The smallest sum suggests that two of the smallest numbers are being added.\n**4.  Finding the Numbers**\n* **Finding the middle two numbers:** The remaining sums (19, 20, 21, and 22) must be formed by pairing the two largest numbers with the two smallest numbers. Since 19 and 22 are relatively close, it's likely that these two sums are formed by pairing one of the largest numbers with one of the smallest numbers. The other two sums (20 and 21) are likely formed by pairing the other largest and smallest number.\n* **Finding the largest numbers:** To get 25, the two largest numbers must be 11 and 14 (since 11 + 14 = 25).\n* **Finding the smallest numbers:** To get 16, the two smallest numbers must be 3 and 13 (since 3 + 13 = 16).\n**5.  Verification**\nLet's verify that these numbers produce the remaining sums:\n* 11 + 3 = 14\n* 14 + 3 = 17\n* 11 + 13 = 24\n**Solution**\nThe four integers in increasing order are: **3, 11, 13, 14** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Finding the Sum of the Integers**\n* Notice that each integer is used in three different pairs.\n* Therefore, if we add up all the given sums, we're essentially adding each integer three times. \n*  The total sum of the six pairs is 16 + 19 + 20 + 21 + 22 + 25 = 123.\n* Since this is three times the sum of the four integers, the sum of the four integers is 123 / 3 = 41.\n**2. Using the Information about the Pairs**\n* Let's consider the smallest and largest sums: 16 and 25.\n* The smallest sum (16) represents the sum of the two smallest integers.\n* The largest sum (25) represents the sum of the two largest integers.\n**3.  Finding the Middle Integers**\n*  We know the sum of all four integers is 41.\n*  Subtracting the smallest sum (16) from the total sum gives us 41 - 16 = 25. This represents the sum of the two largest integers.\n*  Similarly, subtracting the largest sum (25) from the total sum gives us 41 - 25 = 16. This represents the sum of the two smallest integers.\n*  Notice that we now have two pairs with the same sum: 16.  This tells us that the middle two integers must be 8 and 8.\n**4. Finding the Smallest and Largest Integers**\n*  Since the sum of the smallest two integers is 16, and we know one of them is 8, the other smallest integer must be 16 - 8 = 8.\n*  Since the sum of the largest two integers is 25, and we know one of them is 8, the other largest integer must be 25 - 8 = 17.\n**Solution:**\nThe four integers in increasing order are **7, 8, 8, 17**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understanding the Problem:**\nWe have four distinct integers, and we know the sums of each possible pair.  Our goal is to find the four integers.\n**2. Finding the Sum of All Integers:**\nNotice that each integer appears in three different pairs. Therefore, if we add all the given sums, we'll be adding each integer three times. \n*  16 + 19 + 20 + 21 + 22 + 25 = 123\nSince each integer is added three times, the sum of all four integers is:\n*  123 / 3 = 41\n**3. Finding the Largest and Smallest Integers:**\n* The largest sum (25) is formed by adding the two largest integers.\n* The smallest sum (16) is formed by adding the two smallest integers.\n**4. Combining Information:**\nLet's represent the four integers as *a*, *b*, *c*, and *d*, where *a* < *b* < *c* < *d*.\n*  *a* + *d* = 25\n*  *b* + *c* = 16\nWe also know that *a + b + c + d* = 41.  \nSubstituting the first two equations into the last equation, we get:\n* (25) + (16) = 41\nThis confirms our understanding of the problem.\n**5. Finding the Remaining Pairs:**\nNow, we need to figure out which remaining pairs make up the sums of 19, 20, 21, and 22. Since we know *a* + *d* = 25, the remaining pairs must involve *b* and *c*.  Let's see if we can find two pairs that add to 19 and 21:\n* **Possibility 1:** If *b* + *d* = 19 and *a* + *c* = 21, then (25) + (19) + (21) = 65, which is greater than the total sum of all integers (41).  This is not possible.\n* **Possibility 2:** If *b* + *d* = 21 and *a* + *c* = 19, then (25) + (21) + (19) = 65, which is again not possible. \nThis means the remaining pairs must add to 20 and 22.  \n**6. Solving for the Integers:**\nWe have the following equations:\n* *a* + *d* = 25\n* *b* + *c* = 16\n* *b* + *d* = 20\n* *a* + *c* = 22\nSubtracting the second equation from the third equation, we get:\n* *d* - *c* = 4\nSubtracting the fourth equation from the first equation, we get:\n* *d* - *c* = 3\nThis contradiction means our initial assumptions about the remaining pairs were incorrect.  Let's try a different approach:\n*  *b* + *d* = 20 \n*  *a* + *c* = 22\nNow, subtracting the first of these two equations from the third equation, we get:\n* *a* - *b* = 2\nSubtracting the fourth equation from the second equation, we get:\n* *b* - *a* = -6\nThis contradiction tells us that our assumption that *b* + *d* = 20 must be incorrect. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that *b* + *d* = 22 and *a* + *c* = 20.\n**7. Final Solution:**\nWe now have the following system of equations:\n* *a* + *d* = 25\n* *b* + *c* = 16\n* *b* + *d* = 22\n* *a* + *c* = 20\nSolving this system of equations, we find:\n* *a* = 5\n* *b* = 7\n* *c* = 15\n* *d* = 20\nTherefore, the four integers in increasing order are **5, 7, 15, 20**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1.  Find the Sum of All Integers:**\n* Notice that each integer appears in three of the six sums.  \n* Therefore, the sum of all four integers is (16 + 19 + 20 + 21 + 22 + 25) / 3 = 63 / 3 = 21.\n**2.  Use the Sum to Find Clues:**\n* **Clue 1:**  Since the sum of the four integers is 21,  there must be at least one negative integer to balance out the larger positive integers.\n* **Clue 2:**  The smallest possible pair sum is 16.  This means the two smallest integers must sum to 16.\n**3.  Find the Smallest Two Integers:**\n* Consider the possible pairs that add to 16:  (1, 15), (2, 14), (3, 13), (4, 12), (5, 11), (6, 10), (7, 9), and (8, 8).\n*  We need to find a pair that, when combined with other pairs, forms the other given sums. \n* Let's try (5, 11) as our smallest pair.\n**4.  Use the Other Sums to Find the Remaining Integers:**\n* **Sum of 19:**  Since 19 is close to 16, we need another small number to pair with 5.  The only other possibility is 14 (14 + 5 = 19).\n* **Sum of 25:**  To get 25, we need to pair the largest number with one of the smaller numbers.  Pairing 14 and 11 gives us 25.\n* **Checking the Remaining Sums:**\n    * 11 + 14 = 25 (already found)\n    * 5 + 14 = 19 (already found)\n    * 5 + 11 = 16 (already found)\n    * 11 + 15 = 26 (not a given sum)\n    * 14 + 15 = 29 (not a given sum)\n* We've now accounted for all six sums, using the integers 5, 11, 14, and 15.\n**5.
