    "solution": "The equation $x^2+y^2 - 6=6x+2y$ can be rewritten as $x^2-6x+y^2-2y=6$. Completing the square, this can further be rewritten as $(x-3)^2-9+(y-1)^2-1=6$. Moving the constants to the right side of the equation, this is $(x-3)^2+(y-1)^2=16$, which is the equation of a circle with center $(3,1)$ and radius $\\boxed{4}$.",

        "Here's how to figure out the size of Cookie Monster's cookie:\n**1.  Rewrite the equation in standard circle form:**\n* The standard form of a circle's equation is  (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2, where (h, k) is the center of the circle and r is the radius.\n* To get our equation into this form, we'll complete the square:\n   *  Start by moving the constant term to the right side of the equation:\n      x^2 + y^2 - 6x - 2y = 12\n   *  Complete the square for the x terms:\n      (x^2 - 6x + 9) + y^2 - 2y = 12 + 9  (We add 9 to both sides because (-6/2)^2 = 9)\n   *  Complete the square for the y terms:\n      (x^2 - 6x + 9) + (y^2 - 2y + 1) = 12 + 9 + 1  (We add 1 to both sides because (-2/2)^2 = 1)\n   *  Now we can rewrite the equation:\n      (x - 3)^2 + (y - 1)^2 = 22\n**2. Identify the radius:**\n*  The equation is now in standard form.  The radius, 'r', is the square root of the constant on the right side of the equation.\n*  Therefore, the radius of the cookie is \u221a22.\n**3. Determine the size:**\n* We don't have a precise definition of \"lunch-sized\" or \"snack-sized\" cookies.  However, \u221a22 is approximately 4.69. This is a fairly large cookie.\n**Conclusion:**\nCookie Monster might be happy with a cookie of radius \u221a22. It's probably a good-sized lunch cookie! \n",
