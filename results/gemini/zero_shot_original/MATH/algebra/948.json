The domain of a rational function is the set of  all real numbers, except for those at which the function is undefined, which is where our denominator equals 0. The denominator equals 0 when $x=6$ or $x=-4$, which means that the domain is $x \\in \\boxed{(-\\infty,-4)\\cup(-4,6)\\cup(6,\\infty)}$.",

        "Here's how to find the domain of the function step-by-step:\n**1. Identify the restrictions:**\n* The function is a rational function (a fraction where the numerator and denominator are polynomials). \n* Rational functions are undefined when the denominator is zero.\n**2. Find where the denominator is zero:**\n* Factor the denominator:  x\u00b2 - 2x - 24 = (x - 6)(x + 4)\n* Set the factored denominator equal to zero: (x - 6)(x + 4) = 0\n* Solve for x: x = 6 or x = -4\n**3. Exclude the restricted values from the domain:**\n* The function is undefined at x = 6 and x = -4.\n**4. Express the domain in interval notation:**\n* The domain is all real numbers except for x = 6 and x = -4.\n* In interval notation, this is:  **(-\u221e, -4) \u222a (-4, 6) \u222a (6, \u221e)** \n",
        "Here's how to find the domain of the function step-by-step:\n**1. Identify the Restrictions**\nThe function is a rational function (a fraction where the numerator and denominator are polynomials). The only restriction on the domain of a rational function is that the denominator cannot be zero.  \n**2. Find the Values that Make the Denominator Zero**\nTo find these values, set the denominator equal to zero and solve:\n*  x\u00b2 - 2x - 24 = 0\n*  (x - 6)(x + 4) = 0\n*  x = 6  or  x = -4\n**3. Exclude the Restricted Values**\nThe values x = 6 and x = -4 make the denominator zero.  Therefore, these values must be excluded from the domain.\n**4. Express the Domain in Interval Notation**\nThe domain is all real numbers except for x = 6 and x = -4.  This can be expressed in interval notation as:\n* **(-\u221e, -4) \u222a (-4, 6) \u222a (6, \u221e)** \n",
        "Here's how to find the domain of the function:\n**1. Identify potential restrictions:**\n* The function is a rational function (a fraction with polynomials). The main restriction for rational functions is that the denominator cannot be zero.\n**2.  Find the values that make the denominator zero:**\n* Factor the denominator:  $x^2 - 2x - 24 = (x-6)(x+4)$\n* Set the denominator equal to zero and solve:  $(x-6)(x+4) = 0$. This gives us solutions  $x = 6$ and $x = -4$.\n**3. Exclude the restricted values:**\n* The function is undefined when  $x = 6$ and $x = -4$.
