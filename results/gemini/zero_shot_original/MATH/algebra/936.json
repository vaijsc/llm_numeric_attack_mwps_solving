        "Here's how to find the slope of the perpendicular line:\n1. **Find the slope of the given line:**\n   The slope of a line passing through points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by:\n   ```\n   slope = (y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)\n   ```\n   In our case,  $(x_1, y_1) = (-1, 2)$ and $(x_2, y_2) = (1, -2)$.  Substituting:\n   ```\n   slope = (-2 - 2) / (1 - (-1)) = -4 / 2 = -2\n   ```\n2. **Find the slope of the perpendicular line:**\n   Perpendicular lines have slopes that are negative reciprocals of each other.  This means:\n   ```\n   slope of perpendicular line = -1 / (slope of given line)\n   ```\n   Therefore, the slope of the perpendicular line is:\n   ```\n   -1 / (-2) = 1/2\n   ```\n**Answer:** The slope of the line perpendicular to the line containing the points $(-1,2)$ and $(1,-2)$ is **1/2**. \n",
