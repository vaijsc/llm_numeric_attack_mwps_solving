        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n* **1st Bounce:** The ball falls 16 feet and bounces back up 16/2 = 8 feet. Total distance: 16 + 8 = 24 feet.\n* **2nd Bounce:** The ball falls 8 feet and bounces back up 8/2 = 4 feet. Total distance: 24 + 8 + 4 = 36 feet.\n* **3rd Bounce:** The ball falls 4 feet and bounces back up 4/2 = 2 feet. Total distance: 36 + 4 + 2 = 42 feet.\n* **4th Bounce:** The ball falls 2 feet and bounces back up 2/2 = 1 feet. Total distance: 42 + 2 + 1 = 45 feet.\n* **5th Bounce:** The ball falls 1 feet and bounces back up 1/2 = 0.5 feet. Total distance: 45 + 1 + 0.5 = 46.5 feet.\n* **6th Bounce:** The ball falls 0.5 feet. Total distance: 46.5 + 0.5 = 47 feet.\n**Therefore, the ball will have traveled 47 feet when it hits the floor for the sixth time.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step by step:\n**1.  Initial Drop:**\n* The ball falls 16 feet initially.\n**2.  First Bounce:**\n* It bounces back up to 16 feet / 2 = 8 feet.\n* Then it falls back down those 8 feet.\n**3.  Second Bounce:**\n* It bounces back up to 8 feet / 2 = 4 feet.\n* Then it falls back down those 4 feet.\n**4.  Third Bounce:**\n* It bounces back up to 4 feet / 2 = 2 feet.\n* Then it falls back down those 2 feet.\n**5.  Fourth Bounce:**\n* It bounces back up to 2 feet / 2 = 1 foot.\n* Then it falls back down that 1 foot.\n**6.  Fifth Bounce:**\n* It bounces back up to 1 foot / 2 = 0.5 feet.\n* Then it falls back down those 0.5 feet.\n**7.  Sixth Bounce:**\n* The ball hits the floor for the sixth time.\n**Total Distance:**\n* **Downward:** 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 0.5 = 31.5 feet\n* **Upward:** 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 0.5 = 15.5 feet\n* **Total:** 31.5 feet + 15.5 feet = **47 feet**\n**Therefore, the ball will have traveled 47 feet when it hits the floor for the sixth time.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Initial Fall:**\n* The ball falls 16 feet initially.\n**2. First Bounce:**\n* It bounces back to half the height, so it travels 16 / 2 = 8 feet upward.\n* Then, it falls back down those 8 feet.\n**3. Second Bounce:**\n* It bounces back to half the height of the last fall (8 feet), meaning it travels 8 / 2 = 4 feet upward.\n* Then, it falls back down those 4 feet.\n**4. Third Bounce:**\n* It bounces back to half the height of the last fall (4 feet), meaning it travels 4 / 2 = 2 feet upward.\n* Then, it falls back down those 2 feet.\n**5. Fourth Bounce:**\n* It bounces back to half the height of the last fall (2 feet), meaning it travels 2 / 2 = 1 foot upward.\n* Then, it falls back down that 1 foot.\n**6. Fifth Bounce:**\n* It bounces back to half the height of the last fall (1 foot), meaning it travels 1 / 2 = 0.5 feet upward.\n* Then, it falls back down that 0.5 feet.\n**7. Sixth Bounce:**\n* The ball is about to hit the ground for the sixth time. \n**Total Distance:**\n* To calculate the total distance, we add up the distances from each fall and bounce:\n    16 (initial fall) + 8 (first bounce up) + 8 (first bounce down) + 4 (second bounce up) + 4 (second bounce down) + 2 (third bounce up) + 2 (third bounce down) + 1 (fourth bounce up) + 1 (fourth bounce down) + 0.5 (fifth bounce up) + 0.5 (fifth bounce down) = **47 feet**\n**Therefore, the ball will have traveled 47 feet when it hits the floor for the sixth time.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Calculate the distance traveled in the first fall:**\n* The ball falls 16 feet.\n**2. Calculate the distance traveled in the first bounce:**\n* The ball bounces back to half the height, which is 16 feet / 2 = 8 feet.\n* Since it traveled 8 feet up and then 8 feet down, the total distance for the first bounce is 8 feet + 8 feet = 16 feet.\n**3. Calculate the distance traveled in the second bounce:**\n* The ball bounces back to half the height of the previous bounce, which is 8 feet / 2 = 4 feet.\n* Total distance for the second bounce is 4 feet + 4 feet = 8 feet.\n**4. Continue this pattern for the remaining bounces:**\n* Third bounce: 4 feet / 2 = 2 feet.  Total distance = 2 feet + 2 feet = 4 feet.\n* Fourth bounce: 2 feet / 2 = 1 foot.  Total distance = 1 foot + 1 foot = 2 feet.\n* Fifth bounce: 1 foot / 2 = 0.5 feet. Total distance = 0.5 feet + 0.5 feet = 1 foot.\n**5. Calculate the total distance traveled:**\n* Add up the distances from each fall and bounce: 16 feet + 16 feet + 8 feet + 4 feet + 2 feet + 1 foot + 1 foot = **58 feet**\n**Therefore, the ball will have traveled 58 feet when it hits the floor for the sixth time.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Downward Journey:**\n* The ball falls 16 feet initially.\n**2.

Second Bounce:**\n* The ball bounces back up to 8/2 = 4 feet.\n* Then, it falls back down 4 feet.\n**4. Third Bounce:**\n* The ball bounces back up to 4/2 = 2 feet.\n* Then, it falls back down 2 feet.\n**5. Fourth Bounce:**\n* The ball bounces back up to 2/2 = 1 foot.\n* Then, it falls back down 1 foot.\n**6.
