        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n* **Week 1:** Cal loses 1% of his starting weight, which is 0.01 * 244 pounds = 2.44 pounds.  He ends the week weighing 244 - 2.44 = 241.56 pounds.\n* **Week 2:** He loses 1% of his weight from the end of week 1, which is 0.01 * 241.56 pounds = 2.4156 pounds.  He ends the week weighing 241.56 - 2.4156 = 239.1444 pounds.\n* **Continue this process for all 10 weeks.**  It would be tedious to do by hand, so it's better to use a calculator or spreadsheet.  \n* **After 10 weeks, Cal's weight will be approximately 219 pounds.** \n**Therefore, Cal expects to weigh approximately 219 pounds at the end of the ten weeks.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**Week 1:**\n* Weight loss: 244 pounds * 0.01 = 2.44 pounds\n* Weight at the end of week 1: 244 pounds - 2.44 pounds = 241.56 pounds\n**Week 2:**\n* Weight loss: 241.56 pounds * 0.01 = 2.4156 pounds\n* Weight at the end of week 2: 241.56 pounds - 2.4156 pounds = 239.1444 pounds\n**Continuing this pattern for 10 weeks:**\nYou can keep calculating the weight loss and remaining weight for each week. However, there's a more efficient way using a calculator:\n* **Week 10:** 244 pounds * (0.99)^10 = approximately 221.66 pounds\n**Answer:** Cal O'Ree expects to weigh approximately **222 pounds** at the end of the ten weeks. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n* **Week 1:** Cal loses 1% of his starting weight, which is 0.01 * 244 = 2.44 pounds.  He'll weigh 244 - 2.44 = 241.56 pounds at the end of week 1.\n* **Week 2:** Cal loses 1% of his weight from the end of week 1, which is 0.01 * 241.56 = 2.42 pounds (rounded to two decimal places). He'll weigh 241.56 - 2.42 = 239.14 pounds at the end of week 2.\n* **Continue this pattern:** We can repeat this process for each week.  It's easier to use a calculator or spreadsheet to do the calculations.\n**Here's a faster way:**\nSince each week's weight loss is a percentage of the previous week's weight, we can use a simple exponential formula:\n* **Final Weight = Initial Weight * (1 - Percentage Loss)^Number of Weeks**\nIn this case:\n* Final Weight = 244 * (1 - 0.01)^10 \n* Final Weight = 244 * (0.99)^10\n* Final Weight \u2248 220.28\n**Answer:** Cal expects to weigh approximately **220 pounds** at the end of ten weeks. \n",
