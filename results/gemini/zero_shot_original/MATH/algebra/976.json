        "### Response:\n1. **Set up the equation:** To find the points of intersection, we need to solve the equation $x^4 = 7x^2 - 10$.\n2. **Rearrange the equation:**  Subtract $7x^2 - 10$ from both sides to get  $x^4 - 7x^2 + 10 = 0$.\n3. **Factor the equation:**  This equation is a quadratic in $x^2$.
