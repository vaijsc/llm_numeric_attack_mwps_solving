    "problem": "Connie is starting an exercise program. On June 1, she will do 25 sit-ups. Each day after that, she will increase her number of sit-ups by four. On which date during the month of June will Connie first do more than 100 sit-ups in one day?",

    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "On June $n$th, Connie will do $25 + 4(n-1)$ sit-ups.  In this problem, we are trying to find the smallest positive integer $n$ such that \\[25 + 4(n-1) > 100.\\]  Simplifying the inequality yields $25+4n-4>100$, or $4n>79$.  The smallest positive integer $n$ that satisfies this simplified inequality is $n=20$; hence, Connie will do more than 100 sit-ups in one day on $\\boxed{\\text{June 20}}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this step-by-step:\n* **Day 1 (June 1):** Connie does 25 sit-ups.\n* **Day 2 (June 2):** She does 25 + 4 = 29 sit-ups.\n* **Day 3 (June 3):** She does 29 + 4 = 33 sit-ups.\nWe can see a pattern here: she increases her sit-ups by 4 each day.  Let's figure out when she'll reach over 100:\n* **Keep adding 4:**  33 + 4 = 37, 37 + 4 = 41, and so on.\n* **Find a number close to 100:**  We can keep adding 4 until we get close to 100. \n* **Calculate:** 97 + 4 = 101\n**Therefore, Connie will first do more than 100 sit-ups on June 26th.** \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this:\n**1. Figure out the pattern:**\n* Connie starts with 25 sit-ups.\n* Each day she adds 4 more.\n**2. Find the increase over a few days:**\n* Day 2: 25 + 4 = 29 sit-ups\n* Day 3: 29 + 4 = 33 sit-ups\n* Day 4: 33 + 4 = 37 sit-ups\n**3.  Estimate where she'll hit over 100:**\n* Since she's adding 4 each day, it will take a while to get over 100.  Let's try a few more days:\n    * Day 10: 25 + (4 * 9) = 61 sit-ups\n    * Day 20: 25 + (4 * 19) = 97 sit-ups\n    * Day 21: 25 + (4 * 20) = 101 sit-ups\n**4.  The answer:**\n* On June 21st, Connie will do 101 sit-ups, which is the first day she'll do more than 100. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Figure out the pattern:**\n* Connie starts with 25 sit-ups.\n* Each day, she adds 4 sit-ups.\n**2.  Find the increase over several days:**\n* Day 1: 25 sit-ups\n* Day 2: 25 + 4 = 29 sit-ups\n* Day 3: 29 + 4 = 33 sit-ups\n* Day 4: 33 + 4 = 37 sit-ups \n**3.  Keep adding until you reach over 100:**\n* Day 5: 37 + 4 = 41 sit-ups\n* Day 6: 41 + 4 = 45 sit-ups\n* ...and so on\n**4.  Calculate the increase from Day 1 to over 100:**\n* Connie needs to increase from 25 sit-ups to over 100.\n* The difference is 100 - 25 = 75 sit-ups.\n**5.  Determine the number of days:**\n*  Since she increases by 4 sit-ups each day, we need to find out how many times 4 goes into 75.\n* 75 / 4 = 18.75.  Since we need to pass 100, we round up to 19.\n**6.  Find the date:**\n* Connie starts on June 1st. \n* Add 19 days: June 1 + 19 days = June 20th.\n**Answer:** Connie will first do more than 100 sit-ups on **June 20th**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Figure out the pattern:**\n* Connie starts with 25 sit-ups and increases by 4 each day.  This means she's following an arithmetic sequence: 25, 29, 33, 37...\n**2. Determine how many times she needs to increase to reach over 100:**\n* To find out how many times she needs to add 4 to get over 100, start subtracting 25 from 100: 100 - 25 = 75. \n* Then divide that difference by 4: 75 / 4 = 18.75.  Since she can't do a fraction of a sit-up, we round up to 19. \n**3. Calculate the date:**\n* Connie increases her sit-ups 19 times after June 1st. \n* Since June has 30 days, the date she reaches over 100 sit-ups would be June 1 + 19 days = **June 20th**.\n**Therefore, Connie will first do more than 100 sit-ups on June 20th.** \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this step-by-step:\n**1. Figure out the pattern:**\n* Connie starts with 25 sit-ups.\n* She increases by 4 sit-ups each day.\n**2. Set up an equation:**\n* Let 'd' represent the number of days after June 1st.\n* The total number of sit-ups on any given day can be represented by the equation: 25 + 4d\n**3. Find the day she does more than 100 sit-ups:**\n* We want to find the smallest value of 'd' that makes the equation greater than 100.\n* So, we need to solve the inequality: 25 + 4d > 100\n**4. Solve the inequality:**\n* Subtract 25 from both sides: 4d > 75\n* Divide both sides by 4: d > 18.75\n**5. Interpret the answer:**\n* Since we can't have a fraction of a day, Connie will first do more than 100 sit-ups on the 19th day after June 1st.\n**6. Calculate the date:**\n* June 1st + 19 days = June 20th\n**Answer:** Connie will first do more than 100 sit-ups on **June 20th**. \n"
