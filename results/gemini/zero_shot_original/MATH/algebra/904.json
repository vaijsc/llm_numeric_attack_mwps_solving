        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Elimination Method**\n* **Focus on eliminating variables:**  Notice that each equation has a '3' multiplying one of the variables.  This suggests using elimination to isolate a variable.\n* **Subtract equations:**\n    * Subtract the first equation from the second: \n        (a + 3b + c) - (3a + b + c) = 9 - (-3)\n        -2a + 2b = 12\n    * Subtract the first equation from the third:\n        (a + b + 3c) - (3a + b + c) = 19 - (-3)\n        -2a + 2c = 22\n**2. Solve for Two Variables**\n* **Simplify:**  Divide both equations by -2:\n    * a - b = -6 \n    * a - c = -11\n* **Solve for 'a':**  Add the two simplified equations together:\n    (a - b) + (a - c) = -6 + (-11)\n    2a - b - c = -17\n* **Isolate 'a':**  Since we know b + c = -3 (from the original first equation), substitute:\n    2a - (-3) = -17\n    2a + 3 = -17\n    2a = -20\n    a = -10\n**3. Find the Remaining Variables**\n* **Substitute 'a' back:** Use the simplified equations from step 2 to find 'b' and 'c'.\n    * -10 - b = -6\n      b = -4\n    * -10 - c = -11\n      c = 1\n**4.

This means we have a dependent system, and we can solve for 'b' and 'c' in terms of a single variable.  Let's use the third equation:\n   -b + c = 5\n   c = b + 5\n* **Step 7:** Substitute the value of 'c' in terms of 'b' into the equation for 'a':\n   a = b - 6 \n**3. Calculate abc**\n* Now we have expressions for a, b, and c in terms of 'b':\n    * a = b - 6\n    * b = b \n    * c = b + 5\n* **Step 8:**  To find abc, substitute these expressions:\n   abc = (b - 6)(b)(b + 5)\n   abc = b(b - 6)(b + 5)\n* **Since we don't have a specific numerical value for 'b', we cannot find a specific numerical value for abc.
