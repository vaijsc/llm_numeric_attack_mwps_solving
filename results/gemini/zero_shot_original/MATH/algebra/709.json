Adding $144$ to both sides of the first inequality, we get $$144\\ge 54p,$$implying $$\\frac{144}{54}\\ge p.$$Reducing the fraction and switching the sides (along with the direction of the inequality), we get $p\\le\\frac{8}{3}$.\n\n\nTo solve the second inequality, we add $20p$ to both sides: $$20p > 12$$Dividing both sides by $20$, we get $$p>\\frac{12}{20}.$$Reducing the fraction gives $p>\\frac{3}{5}$.\n\n\nWe are looking for $p$ which satisfy both inequalities. The intersection of the solutions above is $\\boxed{\\left(\\frac{3}{5},\\frac{8}{3}\\right]}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the inequalities step-by-step:\n**1. Solve the first inequality:**\n*  $0 \\ge 54p - 144$\n*  Add 144 to both sides:  $144 \\ge 54p$\n*  Divide both sides by 54: $ \\frac{8}{3} \\ge p$\n**2. Solve the second inequality:**\n*  $0 > 12 - 20p$\n*  Subtract 12 from both sides: $-12 > -20p$\n*  Divide both sides by -20 (remember to flip the inequality sign when dividing by a negative number): $\\frac{3}{5} < p$\n**3. Combine the solutions:**\nWe want the values of *p* that satisfy *both* inequalities.  This means:\n*  $\\frac{3}{5} < p$   and  $\\frac{8}{3} \\ge p$\nCombining these, we get: \n*  $\\frac{3}{5} < p \\le \\frac{8}{3}$\n**4.
