    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let the number of quarters in the first, second, third, and fourth piles be $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$, respectively. We have the equations \\begin{align*} \\tag{1}\na+b+c+d&=27\\\\ \\tag{2}\na&=b-5\\\\ \\tag{3}\nb&=c+4\\\\ \\tag{4}\nd&=3b\n\\end{align*} We want to find the value of $d$. We will express each of $a$, $b$, and $c$ in terms of $d$ and then substitute these equations into Equation (1) to find the value of $d$. From Equation (4), we have $b=d/3$. From Equation (3), we have $c=b-4$. Since $b=d/3$, we can rewrite Equation (3) as $c=d/3-4$. We can substitute $b=d/3$ into Equation (2) to get $a=d/3-5$. Substituting $b=d/3$, $c=d/3-4$, and $a=d/3-5$ into Equation (1) to eliminate $a$, $b$, and $c$, we get $(d/3-5)+d/3+(d/3-4)+d=27$, so $d=18$. Thus, there are $\\boxed{18}$ quarters in the fourth pile.",
