        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding the Pattern**\nThe sum $1 + 2 + 3 + \\cdots + 98 + 99 + 100$ represents the sum of all the whole numbers from 1 to 100. There's a clever trick to calculate this quickly.\n**The Trick**\n1. **Pair the numbers:** Notice that if you pair the first and last number (1 + 100), the second and second-to-last number (2 + 99), and so on, each pair adds up to 101. \n2. **Count the pairs:**  There are 50 pairs in total (100 numbers / 2 numbers per pair).\n3. **Multiply:**  The sum of all the pairs is 50 pairs * 101 per pair = 5050\n**Therefore, 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 98 + 99 + 100 = 5050** \n",
