    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "First we divide both sides by 2 to get $x(x-10)=-25$. Expanding the left side and bringing the constant over, we get $x^2-10x+25=0$. We can factor this into $(x-5)(x-5)$, so the only possible value for $x$ is $\\boxed{5}$, which is also our answer.",

        "1. **Expand the equation:** \n   Start by distributing the 2x:\n   \n   2x(x - 10) = -50 \n   2x\u00b2 - 20x = -50\n2. **Move all terms to one side:**\n   Add 50 to both sides to set the equation equal to zero:\n   2x\u00b2 - 20x + 50 = 0\n3. **Simplify the equation (optional):**\n   Divide both sides by 2 to make the coefficients smaller:\n   x\u00b2 - 10x + 25 = 0\n4. **Factor the quadratic equation:** \n   This equation factors nicely:\n   (x - 5)(x - 5) = 0\n5. **Solve for x:**\n   For the product of two factors to be zero, at least one of the factors must be zero. Therefore:\n   x - 5 = 0\n   x = 5\n6. **The solution:**\n   Since the equation has a repeated root, the only possible value for x is 5. \n7. **Sum of all possible values:** \n   The sum of all possible values of x is simply 5 + 5 = **10**. \n",
