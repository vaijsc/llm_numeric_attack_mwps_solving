        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Geometry**\n* We have a circle that passes through three given points.\n* The center of the circle is (h,k).\n**2. Use the Distance Formula**\n* The distance from the center of the circle (h,k) to each of the three points is equal to the radius of the circle.  Let's call this radius 'r'.\n* Using the distance formula, we can set up three equations:\n    *  \u221a[(h + 1)\u00b2 + (k - 2)\u00b2] = r  (Distance from (h,k) to (-1,2))\n    *  \u221a[(h - 3)\u00b2 + (k - 0)\u00b2] = r  (Distance from (h,k) to (3,0))\n    *  \u221a[(h - 9)\u00b2 + (k - 0)\u00b2] = r  (Distance from (h,k) to (9,0))\n**3. Simplify the Equations**\n* Square both sides of each equation to get rid of the square roots:\n    * (h + 1)\u00b2 + (k - 2)\u00b2 = r\u00b2\n    * (h - 3)\u00b2 + k\u00b2 = r\u00b2\n    * (h - 9)\u00b2 + k\u00b2 = r\u00b2\n**4. Solve for h and k**\n* We have three equations and three unknowns (h, k, and r).  Let's use the fact that the right-hand side of all three equations is r\u00b2 to eliminate 'r'.  We can subtract the second and third equations from the first:\n    * [(h + 1)\u00b2 + (k - 2)\u00b2] - [(h - 3)\u00b2 + k\u00b2] = 0\n    * [(h + 1)\u00b2 + (k - 2)\u00b2] - [(h - 9)\u00b2 + k\u00b2] = 0\n* Simplify these equations:\n    * 8h - 2k + 8 = 0\n    * 20h - 2k - 72 = 0\n* Now we have two equations with two unknowns. We can solve for h and k using various methods (substitution, elimination).  Let's use elimination:\n    * Subtract the first equation from the second: 12h - 70 = 0\n    * Solve for h:  h = 70/12 = 35/6\n* Substitute this value of h back into either of the simplified equations to solve for k. Let's use 8h - 2k + 8 = 0:\n    * 8(35/6) - 2k + 8 = 0\n    * 116/3 - 2k + 8 = 0\n    * 2k = 140/3\n    * k = 70/3\n**5. Calculate h + k**\n* h + k = (35/6) + (70/3) = 175/6\n**Therefore, the value of h + k is 175/6.** \n",

Simplify the Equations**\nSince the distances are equal, we can equate the expressions under the square roots:\n* (h + 1)^2 + (k - 2)^2 = (h - 3)^2 + k^2 \n* (h + 1)^2 + (k - 2)^2 = (h - 9)^2 + k^2\n**4. Solve for h and k**\nLet's expand the equations and simplify:\n* h^2 + 2h + 1 + k^2 - 4k + 4 = h^2 - 6h + 9 + k^2\n* h^2 + 2h + 1 + k^2 - 4k + 4 = h^2 - 18h + 81 + k^2\nSimplifying further:\n* 8h - 4k = 4 \n* 20h - 4k = 76\nNow we have a system of two equations. We can solve for h and k using elimination or substitution.  Let's use elimination:\n* Subtract the first equation from the second: 12h = 72\n* Solve for h: h = 6\nSubstitute h = 6 back into either of the original equations to find k:\n* 8(6) - 4k = 4\n* 48 - 4k = 4\n* -4k = -44\n* k = 11\n**5.

Use the Distance Formula**\nSince the circle passes through the points (-1, 2), (3, 0), and (9, 0), the distance between the center (h, k) and each of these points is the radius (r). Let's use the distance formula to express these relationships:\n* **Distance from (h, k) to (-1, 2):** \n   \u221a((h + 1)\u00b2 + (k - 2)\u00b2) = r\n* **Distance from (h, k) to (3, 0):**\n   \u221a((h - 3)\u00b2 + (k - 0)\u00b2) = r\n* **Distance from (h, k) to (9, 0):**\n   \u221a((h - 9)\u00b2 + (k - 0)\u00b2) = r\n**3.

Here's how we can use elimination:\n* **Equate the first two distance equations:**\n   \u221a((h + 1)\u00b2 + (k - 2)\u00b2) = \u221a((h - 3)\u00b2 + k\u00b2)\n* **Square both sides:**\n   (h + 1)\u00b2 + (k - 2)\u00b2 = (h - 3)\u00b2 + k\u00b2\n* **Simplify:**\n   h\u00b2 + 2h + 1 + k\u00b2 - 4k + 4 = h\u00b2 - 6h + 9 + k\u00b2\n   8h - 4k = 4\n   2h - k = 1  \n* **Equate the first and third distance equations (similar to the above steps):**\n   \u221a((h + 1)\u00b2 + (k - 2)\u00b2) = \u221a((h - 9)\u00b2 + k\u00b2)\n   (h + 1)\u00b2 + (k - 2)\u00b2 = (h - 9)\u00b2 + k\u00b2\n   h\u00b2 + 2h + 1 + k\u00b2 - 4k + 4 = h\u00b2 - 18h + 81 + k\u00b2\n   20h - 4k = 76\n   5h - k = 19\n**4.

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Properties of Circles**\n* **Distance from Center:**  Every point on a circle is the same distance from the center. This distance is called the radius.\n* **Midpoint:** The center of the circle is the midpoint of the line segment connecting any two points on the circle that are endpoints of a diameter.\n**2. Use the Given Points to Find the Diameter**\n* Notice that the points (3,0) and (9,0) lie on the x-axis and have the same y-coordinate. This means they are endpoints of a horizontal diameter of the circle. \n* The distance between these points is the diameter:  9 - 3 = 6.\n**3. Find the Center (h, k)**\n* Since the diameter is horizontal, the center of the circle must lie on the vertical line that bisects this diameter. This line passes through the midpoint of the diameter, which is (6, 0).\n* Therefore, the x-coordinate of the center (h) is 6. \n* To find the y-coordinate (k), consider the point (-1, 2).  This point is also on the circle.  Since the radius is half the diameter, the radius is 3. The distance between (-1, 2) and (6, k) is 3.  We can use the distance formula: \n   \u221a[(-1 - 6)\u00b2 + (2 - k)\u00b2] = 3\n   Simplify and solve for k:\n   \u221a(49 + (2 - k)\u00b2) = 3\n   49 + (2 - k)\u00b2 = 9\n   (2 - k)\u00b2 = -40\n   Since the square of a real number cannot be negative, there is no solution for k. This means our initial assumption that the points form a circle is incorrect. \n**Conclusion:**\nIt appears there is an error in the problem statement. The points provided do not lie on a single circle. There is no circle that passes through all three given points. \n"
