    "solution": "A point $(x,y)$ is on the graph if and only if $y=(x+2)^4-100$, so we seek to determine all pairs of negative integers $(x,y)$ which satisfy this equation. We can obtain pairs by plugging in $-1,-2,-3,$ and so on for $x$: \\begin{align*}\nx=-1 &\\Rightarrow y=1^4-100=-99 \\\\\nx=-2 &\\Rightarrow y=0^4-100=-100 \\\\\nx=-3 &\\Rightarrow y=(-1)^4-100=-99 \\\\\nx=-4 &\\Rightarrow y=(-2)^4-100=-84 \\\\\nx=-5 &\\Rightarrow y=(-3)^4-100=-19 \\\\\n\\end{align*}Starting at $x=-6$, the $y$-coordinates obtained in this way are positive. To be sure that there are no more solutions, we can solve the equation $$(x+2)^4-100 < 0,$$which yields $-2-\\sqrt[4]{100}<x<-2+\\sqrt[4]{100}$ (in decimals, this is roughly $-5.16<x<1.16$). Thus, the graph of $y=(x+2)^4-100$ passes through $\\boxed{5}$ points with negative integer coordinates.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Understand the Graph:**\n* The graph of  y = (x + 2)^4 - 100 is a transformation of the basic function y = x^4. \n* It's shifted 2 units to the left (because of the (x + 2) term) and 100 units down (because of the -100). \n**2. Consider the Restrictions:**\n* **Negative x-values:**  We need x + 2 to be negative to get a negative x-value. This means x must be less than -2.\n* **Negative y-values:**  Since the graph is shifted down 100 units, we need to find x-values that make (x + 2)^4 less than 100.\n**3. Analyze the Function:**\n* The function (x + 2)^4 is always positive or zero (since any number raised to an even power is non-negative).\n* As x gets more negative, (x + 2)^4 gets larger.  This means there will be a range of x-values where (x + 2)^4 > 100, resulting in positive y-values.\n**4. Find the Boundary:**\n* To find the boundary where (x + 2)^4 = 100, we solve:\n    * (x + 2)^4 = 100\n    * (x + 2) = \u00b1\u221a10 \n    * x = -2 \u00b1 \u221a10\n*  Since we need negative x-values, the relevant solution is x = -2 - \u221a10.\n**5. Conclusion:**\n* Any x-value less than -2 - \u221a10 will result in a y-value greater than -100, meaning the y-value will be positive.\n*  Therefore, there are **no** points on the graph of y = (x + 2)^4 - 100 where both the x and y coordinates are negative integers. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Graph's Shape:**\n* The graph of  y = (x + 2)^4 - 100 is a transformation of the basic graph of y = x^4.\n* The \"+ 2\" inside the parentheses shifts the graph 2 units to the *left*.\n* The \"- 100\" outside the parentheses shifts the graph 100 units *down*.\n**2. Find the x-intercepts:**\n* To find the x-intercepts, set y = 0 and solve for x:\n   0 = (x + 2)^4 - 100\n   100 = (x + 2)^4\n   \u221a100 = (x + 2) \n   \u00b110 = x + 2\n   x = 8 or x = -12\n**3. Analyze the Graph's Behavior:**\n* Since the exponent is even, the graph is symmetrical and opens upwards.\n* The graph is shifted 2 units to the left, so the vertex (lowest point) is at x = -2.\n* The graph is shifted 100 units down.\n**4.  Determine the Range of Negative x-values:**\n* We know the graph has x-intercepts at x = 8 and x = -12.\n* The graph is symmetrical and opens upwards, so for x-values less than -12, the y-values will be positive.\n**5. Consider Negative y-values:**\n* Since the graph is shifted 100 units down, the entire graph lies below the x-axis for x-values between -12 and 8.\n**6.  Find Negative Integer Points:**\n* For x-values between -12 and 8, the y-values will be negative.  However, the graph is symmetrical, so there are an even number of points with negative x and y coordinates.\n**Conclusion:**\nThe graph of y = (x + 2)^4 - 100 has **no points** where both the x and y coordinates are negative integers. \n",

Understand the Function:**\n* The function  $y = (x + 2)^4 - 100$ is a transformation of the basic function $y = x^4$. \n* The \"+2\" inside the parentheses shifts the graph 2 units to the left.\n* The \"-100\" outside the parentheses shifts the graph 100 units down.\n**2. Consider Negative Inputs:**\n* We want to find negative integer values of *x* that result in negative integer values of *y*. \n* Since we're raising *x + 2* to the fourth power, the result will always be non-negative. \n* To get a negative value for *y*, we need the entire expression $(x + 2)^4 - 100$ to be negative.\n**3. Find the Range of x:**\n* To make $(x + 2)^4 - 100$ negative, $(x + 2)^4$ must be less than 100. \n* The largest perfect fourth power less than 100 is 81 (3\u2074).  \n* So, we need to find the range of *x* that satisfies  $(x + 2)^4 < 100$ \n*  This means: -3 < (x + 2) < 3\n*  Solving for *x*: -5 < x < 1\n**4. Check for Negative Integer Solutions:**\n* The only negative integer values of *x* within the range -5 < x < 1 are -4, -3, -2, and -1.\n**5. Test the Solutions:**\n* For each of these *x* values, we need to see if the corresponding *y* value is also a negative integer:\n    *  *x* = -4:   y = (-4 + 2)\u2074 - 100 = 16 - 100 = -84 \n    *  *x* = -3:   y = (-3 + 2)\u2074 - 100 = 1 - 100 = -99\n    *  *x* = -2:   y = (-2 + 2)\u2074 - 100 = 0 - 100 = -100\n    *  *x* = -1:   y = (-1 + 2)\u2074 - 100 = 1 - 100 = -99\n**Conclusion:**\nWe found four points on the graph of  $y = (x + 2)^4 - 100$ where both coordinates are negative integers:\n* (-4, -84)\n* (-3, -99)\n* (-2, -100)\n* (-1, -99)\n**Therefore, there are **4** points on the graph with coordinates that are both negative integers.** \n",

Understand the Graph**\n* The graph of  y = (x + 2)^4 - 100 is a transformation of the basic graph of y = x^4.\n* The \"+2\" inside the parentheses shifts the graph 2 units to the left.\n* The \"-100\" outside the parentheses shifts the graph 100 units down.\n**2. Find the x-values that could give negative y-values**\n* Since the graph is shifted down, we need to find x-values that make the expression (x + 2)^4 less than 100.  \n* Consider the range of possible x-values:\n    * If x is a negative integer less than -3,  (x + 2)^4 will be greater than 1, and subtracting 100 will still result in a negative y-value.\n    * If x is -2 or -1, (x + 2)^4 will be 0 or 1, and subtracting 100 will result in a negative y-value.\n    * If x is 0 or greater, (x + 2)^4 will be greater than or equal to 16, and subtracting 100 will result in a negative y-value.\n**3. Check the y-values**\n* **For x values less than -3:** \n    *  We need to check if (x + 2)^4 - 100 is a negative integer for each x. We can start by trying a few values, but it's likely there will be many negative integers within this range.\n* **For x = -2 and x = -1:**\n    *  We know these will result in negative y-values, but we need to check if they are integers.  \n        * When x = -2, y = (-2 + 2)^4 - 100 = -100 (integer)\n        * When x = -1, y = (-1 + 2)^4 - 100 = -99 (integer)\n**4. Conclusion**\n* We have found at least two points with both negative integer coordinates: (-2, -100) and (-1, -99).\n* We know there are likely many more points with negative integer coordinates when x is less than -3, but it would be tedious to check them all.\n**Therefore, there are at least two points on the graph with both negative integer coordinates, but there are likely many more.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understanding the Graph**\n* **Shifting:** The graph of  y = (x + 2)^4 - 100 is a transformation of the basic graph y = x^4. \n    * The \"+2\" inside the parentheses shifts the graph 2 units to the *left*.\n    * The \"-100\" outside the parentheses shifts the graph 100 units *down*.\n* **Shape:** The graph of y = x^4 is a symmetric, U-shaped curve that opens upwards.  The transformations maintain this basic shape.\n**2. Finding Negative Integer Solutions**\n* **Negative x-values:** To get negative y-values, we need negative x-values. This is because the graph is shifted to the left, meaning the y-values will be negative for some negative x-values.\n* **Minimizing y:** The expression (x + 2)^4 is always non-negative (zero or positive). To get the smallest possible y-value (and potentially negative), we need to minimize (x + 2)^4. This happens when x = -2. \n* **Checking x = -2:** When x = -2, we have y = (-2 + 2)^4 - 100 = -100. This is a point with both negative coordinates.\n* **Other x-values:** As we move further to the left (smaller x-values), the value of (x + 2)^4 will increase, making y even more negative.  \n**3. Conclusion**\nSince the graph is symmetric and the y-values decrease as we move leftward from x = -2, there will be **infinitely many** points with both negative integer coordinates. \n"
