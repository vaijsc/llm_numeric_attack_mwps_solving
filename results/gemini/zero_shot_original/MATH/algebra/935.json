        "Here's how to solve for the sum x + y + z:\n**1. Eliminate one variable:**\n* Notice that the first and third equations both have a '3x' term. Subtract the first equation from the third equation:\n   (3x + 5z) - (3x + y) = 41 - 17\n   This simplifies to: 5z - y = 24\n**2. Combine with the second equation:**\n* Now we have two equations with two variables:\n   * 5z - y = 24\n   * 5y + z = 14\n* To eliminate 'z', multiply the second equation by 5:\n    25y + 5z = 70\n* Subtract the first equation (5z - y = 24) from the modified second equation:\n    25y + 5z - (5z - y) = 70 - 24\n    This simplifies to: 26y = 46\n**3. Solve for y:**\n* Divide both sides by 26:\n    y = 46/26 = 23/13\n**4. Solve for z:**\n* Substitute the value of y back into either the second or third equation. Let's use the second equation:\n    5(23/13) + z = 14\n    115/13 + z = 14\n    z = 14 - 115/13 = 17/13\n**5. Solve for x:**\n* Substitute the values of y and z into any of the original equations. Let's use the first equation:\n    3x + 23/13 = 17\n    3x = 17 - 23/13 = 188/13\n    x = 188/39\n**6. Calculate the sum:**\n* Finally, add the values of x, y, and z:\n    x + y + z = 188/39 + 23/13 + 17/13 = **257/39** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the system of equations to find the sum x + y + z:\n**1. Elimination Method**\n* **Eliminate 'x' from the first and third equations:** \n   Subtract the first equation (3x + y = 17) from the third equation (3x + 5z = 41):\n   (3x + 5z) - (3x + y) = 41 - 17\n   This simplifies to: 5z - y = 24\n* **Now we have two equations with two unknowns:**\n   * 5y + z = 14\n   * 5z - y = 24\n* **Eliminate 'y' from these two equations:**\n   Multiply the second equation by 5: 25z - 5y = 120\n   Add this equation to the first equation: (25z - 5y) + (5y + z) = 120 + 14\n   This simplifies to: 26z = 134\n* **Solve for 'z':**\n   z = 134 / 26 = 5.15 (approximately)\n**2.

Calculate x + y + z**\n* x + y + z = 5.08 + 1.77 + 5.15 \n* **x + y + z = 12** (approximately)\n**Therefore, the value of the sum x + y + z is approximately 12.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Eliminate one variable:**\n* Notice that the first and third equations both have a '3x' term.  Subtract the first equation from the third equation:\n   (3x + 5z) - (3x + y) = 41 - 17\n   This simplifies to: 5z - y = 24\n**2. Create a system of two equations:**\n* Now we have two equations:\n    * 5z - y = 24\n    * 5y + z = 14\n**3. Eliminate another variable:**\n* Multiply the second equation by 5: 25y + 5z = 70\n* Add this modified equation to the first equation: (5z - y) + (25y + 5z) = 24 + 70\n* This simplifies to: 10z + 24y = 94\n**4. Solve for one variable:**\n* Now we have a single equation with two variables: 10z + 24y = 94\n* Divide both sides by 2: 5z + 12y = 47\n* Solve for 'z': z = (47 - 12y) / 5\n**5. Substitute to find another variable:**\n* Substitute this value of 'z' back into the second original equation (5y + z = 14):\n    * 5y + (47 - 12y) / 5 = 14\n* Multiply both sides by 5: 25y + 47 - 12y = 70\n* Simplify: 13y = 23\n* Solve for 'y': y = 23/13\n**6. Find the remaining variable:**\n* Substitute the value of 'y' back into the equation we derived for 'z':\n    * z = (47 - 12 * (23/13)) / 5\n    * z = (47 - 276/13) / 5\n    * z = (295/13) / 5\n    * z = 59/13\n**7. Calculate the sum:**\n* Now we have the values for x, y, and z:\n    * x = (17 - y)/3 = (17 - 23/13)/3 = 178/39\n    * y = 23/13\n    * z = 59/13\n* Calculate the sum: x + y + z = (178/39) + (23/13) + (59/13) = **318/39** \n**Therefore, the value of the sum x + y + z is 318/39.** \n",
