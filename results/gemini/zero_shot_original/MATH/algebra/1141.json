    "solution": "Let $t$ and $u$ be the tens and units digits of John's age.  We are told that $t+u=5$ and $10u+t-(10t+u)=27$.  Rewriting the second equation as $9(u-t)=27$ and dividing by 9, we have \\begin{align*}\nt+u&=5 \\\\\nt-u&=3.\n\\end{align*} Summing these equations, we find $2t=8$, which implies $t=4$.  Substituting back into either equation, we find $u=1$, so John's father is $10t+u=\\boxed{41}$ years old.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\n* We know John's age is reversed to get his father's age. This means if John is 12, his father is 21.\n* The difference between their ages is 27 years (father's age - John's age).\n* The sum of the digits in both ages is 5.\n**2. Setting up Equations**\nLet's represent:\n* John's age as  'ab' (where 'a' is the tens digit and 'b' is the units digit)\n* Father's age as 'ba' \nWe have the following equations:\n* **Equation 1 (Difference):**  ba - ab = 27\n* **Equation 2 (Sum of digits):**  a + b = 5 \n**3. Solving the Equations**\n* **Simplify Equation 1:** \n   * 10b + a - (10a + b) = 27\n   * 9b - 9a = 27\n   * b - a = 3\n* **Now we have two simple equations:**\n   * b - a = 3\n   * a + b = 5\n* **Solve for 'a' and 'b':**\n   * Add the two equations together: 2b = 8\n   * Therefore, b = 4\n   * Substitute b = 4 into either equation to find a: a + 4 = 5, so a = 1\n**4. Finding the Father's Age**\n* We know the father's age is 'ba', so his age is 41.\n**Answer:** The number of years in John's father's age is **41**. \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understanding the Problem:**\n* We know John's age and his father's age have a special relationship: reversing the digits of John's age gives us his father's age.\n* The difference between their ages is 27 years.\n* The sum of the digits in both ages is 5.\n**2. Representing the Ages:**\n* Let's say John's age is represented by the digits \"ab\", where 'a' is the tens digit and 'b' is the units digit.  \n* John's age is then 10a + b.\n* His father's age is represented by \"ba\" (reversing the digits), which is 10b + a.\n**3. Setting Up Equations:**\n* **Difference in Age:**  (10b + a) - (10a + b) = 27 \n* **Sum of Digits:** a + b = 5\n**4. Solving the Equations:**\n* **Simplifying the difference equation:** 9b - 9a = 27  => b - a = 3 \n* **Solving the system of equations:**\n   * We have b - a = 3 \n   * And a + b = 5\n   * Adding these two equations together: 2b = 8 => b = 4\n   * Substituting b = 4 into a + b = 5, we get a = 1\n**5. Finding the Father's Age:**\n* John's age is 10a + b = 10(1) + 4 = 14\n* His father's age is 10b + a = 10(4) + 1 = 41\n**Answer:** John's father is **41 years old**. \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Conditions:**\n* **Reversed digits:**  John's age reversed gives his father's age. \n* **Age difference:**  The father is 27 years older than John.\n* **Digit sum:** The sum of the digits in both ages is 5.\n**2. Set up Variables:**\n* Let John's age be represented by the digits  \"ab\" (where 'a' is the tens digit and 'b' is the units digit).\n* John's age in numerical form is 10a + b.\n* His father's age is represented by the reversed digits \"ba\".\n* His father's age in numerical form is 10b + a.\n**3.
