        "1. **Find the common difference:**  The common difference is 20 - 13 = 7.\n2. **Set up an equation:**  We want to find the largest integer *n* such that 13 + 7(n - 1) \u2264 2008.\n3. **Solve the equation:**\n    * 13 + 7n - 7 \u2264 2008\n    * 7n + 6 \u2264 2008\n    * 7n \u2264 1992\n    * n \u2264 284.57\n4. **Find the number of integers:** Since *n* must be an integer, the largest possible value for *n* is 284.  This means there are **284** integers in the arithmetic sequence. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Identify the pattern:**\nThe sequence is an arithmetic sequence, meaning there's a constant difference between consecutive terms. In this case, the common difference is 7 (20 - 13 = 7, 27 - 20 = 7, and so on).\n**2. Find the general term:**\nThe general term (or nth term) of an arithmetic sequence is given by:\n  * a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d \nWhere:\n* a_n is the nth term\n* a_1 is the first term\n* d is the common difference\n* n is the term number\n**3. Set up an equation:**\nWe want to find the largest value of 'n' for which the term is less than or equal to 2008.  So, we can set up the equation:\n  * 13 + (n - 1)7 \u2264 2008\n**4. Solve for 'n':**\n  * 7n - 7 \u2264 1995\n  * 7n \u2264 2002\n  * n \u2264 286\n**5. Determine the number of integers:**\nSince 'n' represents the term number, and the first term is n = 1, there are 286 integers in the arithmetic sequence from 13 to 2008.\n**Answer:** There are **286** integers in the arithmetic sequence. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Find the Common Difference:**\nThe common difference between consecutive terms in the arithmetic sequence is 7 (20 - 13 = 7, 27 - 20 = 7, and so on).\n**2. Determine the Pattern:**\nThe sequence can be represented as: 13 + 7(n-1), where 'n' is the position of the term in the sequence.\n**3. Find the Value of 'n' for the Last Term:**\nWe need to find the value of 'n' when the term is 2008.  Let's set up the equation:\n13 + 7(n - 1) = 2008\n**4. Solve for 'n':**\n* Simplify: 13 + 7n - 7 = 2008\n* Combine like terms: 6 + 7n = 2008\n* Subtract 6 from both sides: 7n = 1992\n* Divide both sides by 7: n = 284.57\nSince 'n' represents the position in the sequence, it must be a whole number. This means 2008 is not actually a term in the sequence. The last term in the sequence less than 2008 is found when n = 284.\n**5. Calculate the Number of Terms:**\nThere are 284 terms in the arithmetic sequence from 13 to 2008.\n**Therefore, there are 284 integers in the arithmetic sequence 13, 20, 27, 34, ..., 2008.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the common difference:**\nThe common difference is the amount added to each term to get the next term. In this sequence, the common difference is 20 - 13 = 7.\n**2. Set up an equation:**\nLet 'n' be the number of terms in the sequence.
