        "1. **Recognize the equation:** We have a quadratic equation in the form  $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, where $a = -21$, $b = -11$, and $c = 40$.\n2. **Use the quadratic formula:** To solve for $x$, we can use the quadratic formula:\n   \n   $$x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$\n3. **Substitute values:** Substitute the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$ into the formula:\n   $$x = \\frac{-(-11) \\pm \\sqrt{(-11)^2 - 4(-21)(40)}}{2(-21)}$$\n4. **Simplify:**\n   $$x = \\frac{11 \\pm \\sqrt{121 + 3360}}{-42}$$\n   $$x = \\frac{11 \\pm \\sqrt{3481}}{-42}$$\n   $$x = \\frac{11 \\pm 59}{-42}$$\n5. **Find the solutions:**  We have two possible solutions:\n   *  $x_1 = \\frac{11 + 59}{-42} = \\frac{70}{-42} = \\boxed{-\\frac{5}{3}}$\n   *  $x_2 = \\frac{11 - 59}{-42} = \\frac{-48}{-42} = \\boxed{\\frac{8}{7}}$\n6. **Choose the positive solution:** Since the problem specifies $x > 0$, the correct solution is  $\\boxed{\\frac{8}{7}}$. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the quadratic equation step-by-step:\n**1. Factor the quadratic:**\n* We need to find two numbers that multiply to (-21)(40) = -840 and add up to -11.  \n* After some trial and error, we find that -35 and 24 satisfy these conditions.\n* We can rewrite the equation as: \n   -21x\u00b2 - 35x + 24x + 40 = 0\n* Now factor by grouping:\n   -7x(3x + 5) + 8(3x + 5) = 0\n* Factor out the common binomial:\n   (3x + 5)(-7x + 8) = 0\n**2.

        "**1. Factor the quadratic:**\nWe need to find two numbers that multiply to give -840 (the product of -21 and 40) and add up to -11 (the coefficient of the x term).  These numbers are -35 and 24.  We can rewrite the quadratic as:\n```\n0 = -21x\u00b2 - 35x + 24x + 40\n```\nNow, we can factor by grouping:\n```\n0 = -7x(3x + 5) + 8(3x + 5)\n```\n```\n0 = (3x + 5)(-7x + 8)\n```\n**2. Solve for x:**\nFor the product of two factors to be zero, at least one of the factors must be zero.  Therefore, we have two possible solutions:\n* **3x + 5 = 0**  \n   Solving for x, we get  x = -5/3.  This solution is not valid since the problem states that x > 0.\n* **-7x + 8 = 0**\n   Solving for x, we get x = 8/7.  This solution is valid since it is positive.\n**3. The Solution**\nTherefore, the solution to the equation, with the constraint x > 0, is  **x = 8/7**. \n",
        "1. **Factor the quadratic:**  The quadratic doesn't factor easily, so we'll use the quadratic formula.\n2. **Quadratic Formula:** The quadratic formula solves for $x$ in an equation of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$:\n   \n   $$x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$\n3. **Apply the formula:** In our equation, $a = -21$, $b = -11$, and $c = 40$.  Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get:\n   $$x = \\frac{11 \\pm \\sqrt{(-11)^2 - 4(-21)(40)}}{2(-21)}$$\n4. **Simplify:**\n   $$x = \\frac{11 \\pm \\sqrt{3361}}{-42}$$\n   $$x = \\frac{11 \\pm 58}{-42}$$\n5. **Solve for both possible values:**\n   *  $x = \\frac{11 + 58}{-42} = -\\frac{69}{42} = -\\frac{23}{14}$  (We discard this solution since we are looking for $x > 0$)\n   *  $x = \\frac{11 - 58}{-42} = \\frac{47}{42}$\n**Therefore, the solution is $x = \\boxed{\\frac{47}{42}}$.** \n",
