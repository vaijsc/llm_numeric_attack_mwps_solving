    "solution": "We begin by completing the square for $a^2 + 6a - 7.$ We know that the binomial to be squared will be in terms of $a+b$ because the exponent for $a^2$ is 1.\n\nBy expanding $(a+b)^2$, we get $a^2+2ba+b^2$. We get that $2ba=6a$, so $b=3$, and it follows that $(a+3)^2=a^2+6a+9$.\n\nTherefore, $a^2+6a-7=a^2+6a+9-16=(a+3)^2-16$. Since the square of a real number is at least zero, the minimum value of $a^2+6a-7$ is $0-16=\\boxed{-16}$.",

        "Here's how to find the minimum value of the expression:\n**1. Completing the Square**\n* **Factor out a coefficient of 1 from the first two terms:** \n   (a\u00b2 + 6a) - 7\n* **Take half of the coefficient of the 'a' term (which is 6), square it (3\u00b2 = 9), and add and subtract it inside the parentheses:**\n   (a\u00b2 + 6a + 9 - 9) - 7 \n* **Rewrite the expression as a perfect square trinomial:**\n   (a + 3)\u00b2 - 9 - 7\n**2. Simplifying**\n* **Combine the constant terms:**\n   (a + 3)\u00b2 - 16\n**3. Understanding the Expression**\n* **(a + 3)\u00b2 is always greater than or equal to zero, regardless of the value of 'a'.**\n* **Therefore, the minimum value of the expression occurs when (a + 3)\u00b2 = 0.**\n* **When (a + 3)\u00b2 = 0,  a = -3.**\n**4. Finding the Minimum Value**\n* **Substitute a = -3 into the simplified expression:** \n   (-3 + 3)\u00b2 - 16 = -16\n**Conclusion**\nThe minimum value of the expression a\u00b2 + 6a - 7 is **-16**, and it occurs when a = -3. \n",
