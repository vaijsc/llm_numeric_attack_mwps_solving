        "**1. Multiply by $\\frac{\\sqrt7}{\\sqrt7}$**\nSince $\\frac{\\sqrt7}{\\sqrt7}$ is equal to 1, multiplying by it won't change the value of our expression. This helps us get rid of the radical in the denominator:\n$$\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{7}} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{\\sqrt{7}}$$\n**2. Simplify**\nMultiplying the numerators and denominators, we get:\n$$\\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{2 \\cdot 7}$$\n**3. Final answer**\nSimplify the denominator:\n$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{14}}$$ \n",
