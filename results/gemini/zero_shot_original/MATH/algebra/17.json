        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Simplify the Right-Hand Side**\nThe right-hand side of the equation can be simplified:\n```\n  9 / (2\u221a3)  = (9 * \u221a3) / (2 * \u221a3 * \u221a3) = (9\u221a3) / 6 = (3\u221a3) / 2 \n```\n**2. Set Up the Equation**\nNow our equation looks like this:\n```\nA\u221aB / C = (3\u221a3) / 2\n```\n**3.  Match the Terms**\nTo make the equation true, the numerators and denominators must be equal. This means:\n* **A\u221aB = 3\u221a3** \n* **C = 2**\n**4. Analyze the Numerator**\nSince B has no perfect square factors other than 1, and we need  A\u221aB = 3\u221a3, we know:\n* **A = 3** \n* **B = 3** \n**5. Calculate A + B + C**\nFinally, we can calculate the sum:\n* **A + B + C = 3 + 3 + 2 = 8**\n**Therefore, the value of A + B + C is 8.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Simplify the Right Side**\n* The right side of the equation simplifies to: \n  \n   ```\n   \\frac{9}{2\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{9\\sqrt{3}}{2\\sqrt{3} \\cdot \\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2}\n   ```\n**2.  Match the Radicals**\n* To make the left and right sides match, we need to have a $\\sqrt{3}$ in the numerator of the left side.  This means:\n    *  $B$ must include a factor of 3. \n    *  Since $B$ has no perfect square factors other than 1, it must be equal to 3.\n**3.  Simplify the Equation**\n*  Substituting  $B=3$ into the equation, we get:\n   ```\n   \\frac{A\\sqrt{3}}{C} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2}\n   ```\n**4.  Solve for A and C**\n* We can now see that $A=3$ and $C=2$.  This satisfies the condition that $A$ and $C$ have no common prime factors.\n**5.  Calculate A + B + C**\n* Finally,  $A + B + C = 3 + 3 + 2 = \\boxed{8}$. \n",
