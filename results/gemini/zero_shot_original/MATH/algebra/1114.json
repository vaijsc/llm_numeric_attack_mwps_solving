    "solution": "First, we note that $y$ cannot be an integer, since this would imply that $\\lceil y\\rceil\\cdot\\lfloor y\\rfloor = y^2$, and $42$ is not a perfect square.\n\nSince $y$ is not an integer, we have $\\lceil y\\rceil = \\lfloor y\\rfloor + 1$. Define $\\lceil{y}\\rceil$ as $x$ and $\\lfloor{y}\\rfloor$ as $x-1$. If we plug these expressions into the given equation, we get  \\begin{align*} x(x-1)&=42\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad x^2-x&=42\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad x^2-x-42&=0\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad (x-7)(x+6)&=0\n\\end{align*}This yields $x=7$ and $x=-6$ as the only possible values of $x$. However since the problem states that $y>0$ and $x=\\lceil{y}\\rceil$, $x$ must be a positive number and we can eliminate $x=-6$ as a possibility. If $x=\\lceil{y}\\rceil=7$, and $x-1=\\lfloor{y}\\rfloor=6$, $y$ must be between the integers 6 and 7. Therefore, our final answer is $6<y<7$, which is written in interval notation as $\\boxed{(6,7)}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**Understanding the Notation**\n* **Floor Function (\u230ax\u230b):**  The floor function of a number *x* gives the greatest integer less than or equal to *x*. For example, \u230a3.7\u230b = 3 and \u230a5\u230b = 5.\n* **Ceiling Function (\u2308x\u2309):** The ceiling function of a number *x* gives the smallest integer greater than or equal to *x*. For example, \u23083.7\u2309 = 4 and \u23085\u2309 = 5.\n**Finding the Possible Values**\n1. **Factorization:** Since we have a product of two integers equal to 42, let's consider the factors of 42: 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, and 42.\n2. **Matching Floor and Ceiling:** \n   *  If *y* is an integer, then  \u230a*y*\u230b = \u2308*y*\u2309 = *y*.  \n   *  If *y* is not an integer, \u230a*y*\u230b is one less than \u2308*y*\u2309.\n3. **Analyzing the Factors:** \n   * **Case 1:**  If \u230a*y*\u230b = 6 and \u2308*y*\u2309 = 7, then *y* must lie between 6 and 7 (6 < *y* < 7).\n   * **Case 2:** If \u230a*y*\u230b = 7 and \u2308*y*\u2309 = 6, this is not possible since the floor function cannot be greater than the ceiling function.\n**Solution**\nThe only possible range for *y* is **(6, 7)**.  \n**Explanation**\nSince the floor function of *y* must be 6 and the ceiling function must be 7,  *y* cannot be an integer and must lie between 6 and 7. This is represented by the open interval (6, 7). \n",
