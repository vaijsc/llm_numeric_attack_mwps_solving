        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Set up the equation:**\n* Let 'x' represent the smaller odd number.\n* The next consecutive odd number is 'x + 2'.\n* The product of these numbers is 255, so we have the equation: x(x + 2) = 255\n**2. Expand and solve the equation:**\n* x\u00b2 + 2x = 255\n* x\u00b2 + 2x - 255 = 0\n* Factor the quadratic equation: (x + 17)(x - 15) = 0\n* This gives us two possible solutions: x = -17 or x = 15\n**3. Determine the correct solution:**\n* Since we are looking for whole numbers, we discard the negative solution. \n* Therefore, the smaller odd number (x) is 15.\n**4. Find the greater number:**\n* The greater odd number is x + 2, which is 15 + 2 = 17\n**Answer:** The greater number is **17**. \n",
