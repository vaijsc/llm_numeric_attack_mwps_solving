    "solution": "Multiplying both sides of the equation by $7xy$ yields $7y + 7x = xy$. Re-arranging and applying Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick, it follows that $$xy - 7x - 7y + 49 = (x - 7)(y - 7) = 49.$$ Since $x$ and $y$ are positive integers, then $x-7$ is a positive integer factor of $49$. These factors are $1,7,49$, so $x = 8,14,56$, and their sum is $8 + 14 + 56 = \\boxed{78}$.",

        "Here's a step-by-step solution to find the sum of the x-coordinates of all possible positive integer solutions to the equation 1/x + 1/y = 1/7:\n**1.

Complete the Square**\n*  To find integer solutions, we'll use the technique of completing the square. Add 49 to both sides of the equation to complete the square for the terms involving x and y:\n    xy - 7x - 7y + 49 = 49\n*  Factor the left side:\n    (x - 7)(y - 7) = 49\n**3. Find the Factors of 49**\n*  Since we're looking for positive integer solutions, we need to find all the pairs of positive integers that multiply to 49. These are:\n    * 1 and 49\n    * 7 and 7\n**4. Solve for x and y**\n* For each pair of factors, set (x - 7) and (y - 7) equal to the factors and solve for x and y:\n    *  x - 7 = 1  and  y - 7 = 49  -->  x = 8, y = 56\n    *  x - 7 = 7  and  y - 7 = 7   -->  x = 14, y = 14\n**5. Calculate the Sum of x-coordinates**\n* The sum of the x-coordinates of the solutions is 8 + 14 = **22**.\n**Therefore, the sum of the x-coordinates of all possible positive integer solutions to the equation 1/x + 1/y = 1/7 is 22.** \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem:\n**1. Manipulate the equation:**\n   Begin by getting a common denominator on the left side of the equation:\n   ```\n   (y + x) / (xy) = 1/7 \n   ```\n**2. Cross-multiply:**\n   ```\n   7(y + x) = xy \n   ```\n**3. Rearrange into a quadratic:**\n   ```\n   xy - 7x - 7y = 0 \n   ```\n   To make this look like a quadratic, add 49 to both sides (we'll see why in a second):\n   ```\n   xy - 7x - 7y + 49 = 49\n   ```\n   Now, factor by grouping:\n   ```\n   x(y - 7) - 7(y - 7) = 49\n   (x - 7)(y - 7) = 49 \n   ```\n**4. Find the factors of 49:**\n   The factors of 49 are 1, 7, 49.  Since we're looking for *positive* integer solutions, we need to consider both positive and negative factors.\n**5.  Solve for x and y:**\n   We now have a system of equations to solve for each pair of factors:\n   * **Case 1:** (x - 7) = 1 and (y - 7) = 49 \n      * This gives us x = 8 and y = 56.\n   * **Case 2:** (x - 7) = 7 and (y - 7) = 7\n      * This gives us x = 14 and y = 14.\n   * **Case 3:** (x - 7) = 49 and (y - 7) = 1\n      * This gives us x = 56 and y = 8.\n   * **Case 4:** (x - 7) = -1 and (y - 7) = -49\n      * This gives us x = 6 and y = -42 (not a positive integer solution).\n   * **Case 5:** (x - 7) = -7 and (y - 7) = -7\n      * This gives us x = 0 and y = 0 (not positive integer solutions).\n   * **Case 6:** (x - 7) = -49 and (y - 7) = -1\n      * This gives us x = -42 and y = 6 (not positive integer solutions).\n**6.  Calculate the sum:**\n   The only valid positive integer solutions are (8, 56), (14, 14), and (56, 8). The sum of the x-coordinates is 8 + 14 + 56 = **78**. \n",
