    "solution": "The sum of the first 20 positive multiples of 5 is $5+10+15+\\cdots+95+100 = 5 (1 + 2 + \\dots + 20)$.  For all $n$, $1 + 2 + \\dots + n = n(n + 1)/2$, so $5 (1 + 2 + \\dots + 20) = 5 \\cdot 20 \\cdot 21/2 = 1050$.\n\nThe sum of the first 20 positive even integers is $2+4+6+8+\\cdots+38+40 = 2 (1 + 2 + \\dots + 20) = 2 \\cdot 20 \\cdot 21/2 = 420$.  The difference is $1050-420=\\boxed{630}.$\n\nAlternatively, we can subtract the sums, to get\n\\begin{align*}\n5(1 + 2 + \\dots + 20) - 2(1 + 2 + \\dots + 20) &= 3 (1 + 2 + \\dots + 20) \\\\\n&= 3 \\cdot \\frac{20 \\cdot 21}{2} \\\\\n&= 630.\n\\end{align*}",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Find the sum of the first 20 multiples of 5:**\n* The first 20 multiples of 5 are: 5, 10, 15, ... , 100\n* This is an arithmetic series with first term (a) = 5, common difference (d) = 5, and number of terms (n) = 20.\n* The sum (S) of an arithmetic series is: S = (n/2) * [2a + (n-1)d]\n* So, S = (20/2) * [2(5) + (20-1)5] = 10 * (10 + 95) = 10 * 105 = 1050\n**2. Find the sum of the first 20 even integers:**\n* The first 20 even integers are: 2, 4, 6, ... , 40\n* This is also an arithmetic series with a = 2, d = 2, and n = 20.\n* S = (20/2) * [2(2) + (20-1)2] = 10 * (4 + 38) = 10 * 42 = 420\n**3. Calculate the positive difference:**\n* The positive difference between the two sums is 1050 - 420 = 630\n**Therefore, the positive difference between the sum of the first 20 positive multiples of 5 and the sum of the first 20 positive even integers is 630.** \n",
