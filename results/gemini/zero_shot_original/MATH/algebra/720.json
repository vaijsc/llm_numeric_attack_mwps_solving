        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Manipulate the given equations**\n* We are given:\n    *  $x^2 + y^2 = 1$ \n    *  $x^4 + y^4 = \\frac{17}{18}$\n* Notice that we can square the first equation:\n    * $(x^2 + y^2)^2 = 1^2$\n    *  $x^4 + 2x^2y^2 + y^4 = 1$\n**2. Substitute and solve for  $x^2y^2$**\n*  Now we can substitute the value of $x^4 + y^4$ from the second equation into the expanded equation:\n    *  $\\frac{17}{18} + 2x^2y^2 = 1$\n* Simplify and solve for $x^2y^2$:\n    *  $2x^2y^2 = 1 - \\frac{17}{18} = \\frac{1}{18}$\n    *  $x^2y^2 = \\frac{1}{36}$\n**3. Find  xy**\n* Since $x$ and $y$ are positive real numbers, we can take the square root of both sides of the equation above:\n    *  $xy = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{36}}$ \n    *  $xy = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$\n**Therefore, the value of  xy is 1/6.** \n",
