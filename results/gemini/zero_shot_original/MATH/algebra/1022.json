        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Express everything in terms of a common base:**\nSince we're dealing with powers, it's helpful to express everything in terms of the same base.  Notice that all the numbers involved can be written as powers of 2:\n*  $4 = 2^2$\n*  $5 = 5$ (already in base 5)\n*  $6 = 2 \\cdot 3$\n*  $7 = 7$ (already in base 7)\n*  $8 = 2^3$\n**2. Substitute and simplify:**\nNow, let's substitute these into the given equations:\n*  $(2^2)^a = 5$  =>  $2^{2a} = 5$\n*  $5^b = 2 \\cdot 3$\n*  $(2 \\cdot 3)^c = 7$  =>  $2^c \\cdot 3^c = 7$\n*  $7^d = 2^3$\n**3. Combine equations to isolate 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd':**\n* **Finding 'a':**  We can't simplify the equation $2^{2a} = 5$ directly.  We'll need to use it in conjunction with the other equations. \n* **Finding 'b':** Since we have  $2^{2a} = 5$ and $5^b = 2 \\cdot 3$, we can substitute to get: $(2^{2a})^b = 2 \\cdot 3$  =>  $2^{2ab} = 2 \\cdot 3$.  This tells us that $2ab = 1$ (since the base must be the same on both sides), and thus  $ab = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n* **Finding 'c':** We have $2^c \\cdot 3^c = 7$ and $7^d = 2^3$.  Substituting, we get: $(2^c \\cdot 3^c)^d = 2^3$ => $2^{cd} \\cdot 3^{cd} = 2^3$.  This implies $cd = \\frac{3}{2}$ (again, the bases must match).\n* **Finding 'd':**  We can't simplify $7^d = 2^3$ directly.\n**4. Calculate  a \u00b7 b \u00b7 c \u00b7 d:**\nNow, let's multiply the expressions we found for $ab$ and $cd$:\n$(ab) \\cdot (cd) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right) = \\frac{3}{4}$\nTherefore, $a \\cdot b \\cdot c \\cdot d = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}}$. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Express everything in terms of a common base:**\n* Notice that all the numbers in the equations can be expressed as powers of 2:\n    *  $4 = 2^2$\n    *  $5 = 2^{log_2 5}$ \n    *  $6 = 2^{log_2 6}$\n    *  $7 = 2^{log_2 7}$\n    *  $8 = 2^3$\n**2. Substitute the base 2 expressions into the original equations:**\n*  $(2^2)^a = 2^{log_2 5}$  =>  $2^{2a} = 2^{log_2 5}$\n*  $(2^{log_2 5})^b = 2^{log_2 6}$  =>  $2^{b \\cdot log_2 5} = 2^{log_2 6}$\n*  $(2^{log_2 6})^c = 2^{log_2 7}$  =>  $2^{c \\cdot log_2 6} = 2^{log_2 7}$\n*  $(2^{log_2 7})^d = 2^3$  =>  $2^{d \\cdot log_2 7} = 2^3$\n**3. Solve for the exponents:**\nSince the bases are now the same, we can equate the exponents:\n* $2a = log_2 5$  =>  $a = \\frac{log_2 5}{2}$\n* $b \\cdot log_2 5 = log_2 6$  =>  $b = \\frac{log_2 6}{log_2 5}$\n* $c \\cdot log_2 6 = log_2 7$  =>  $c = \\frac{log_2 7}{log_2 6}$\n* $d \\cdot log_2 7 = 3$  =>  $d = \\frac{3}{log_2 7}$\n**4. Calculate the product:**\nNow, let's find the product of *a*, *b*, *c*, and *d*:\n  $a \\cdot b \\cdot c \\cdot d = \\frac{log_2 5}{2} \\cdot \\frac{log_2 6}{log_2 5} \\cdot \\frac{log_2 7}{log_2 6} \\cdot \\frac{3}{log_2 7}$\nNotice that many terms cancel out:\n  $a \\cdot b \\cdot c \\cdot d = \\frac{3}{2}$\n**Therefore,  $a \\cdot b \\cdot c \\cdot d = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}$.** \n",

Substitute and simplify:**\n* **Equation 1:** 4\u1d43 = 5  =>  (2\u00b2)\u1d43 = 5 => 2^(2a) = 5\n* **Equation 2:** 5\u1d47 = 6  =>  5\u1d47 = 2 * 3 \n* **Equation 3:** 6\u1d9c = 7  =>  (2 * 3)\u1d9c = 7 \n* **Equation 4:** 7\u1d48 = 8 => 7\u1d48 = 2\u00b3\n**3. Manipulate the equations to isolate exponents:**\n* **From Equation 1:** We can't directly relate 2^(2a) to 5, so we'll leave it as is for now.\n* **From Equation 2:**  We have 5\u1d47 = 2 * 3.  To get a power of 2, we need to introduce another equation. \n* **From Equation 3:** We have (2 * 3)\u1d9c = 7.  Since we have a product inside the parenthesis, we'll leave it as is for now.\n* **From Equation 4:** We have 7\u1d48 = 2\u00b3.  This relates a power of 7 directly to a power of 2.\n**4. Combine equations:**\n* Since 7\u1d48 = 2\u00b3, we can substitute this into Equation 3:  (2 * 3)\u1d9c = 2\u00b3.\n* Now, let's use Equation 2 to eliminate 5:  We can write 2 * 3 as 5\u1d47.  So, (5\u1d47)\u1d9c = 2\u00b3.\n* Simplifying the left side: 5^(b*c) = 2\u00b3.\n* Now, we have an equation with 5 and 2, but we need to relate it back to Equation 1 (2^(2a) = 5).\n**5. Solve for a, b, c, and d:**\n* Substitute 5 = 2^(2a) into the equation 5^(b*c) = 2\u00b3:  (2^(2a))^(b*c) = 2\u00b3\n* Simplify: 2^(2ab*c) = 2\u00b3\n* For the powers to be equal, the exponents must be equal: 2ab*c = 3\n* From Equation 4, we know 7\u1d48 = 2\u00b3  =>  d = 3/log\u2082(7) \n**6. Final Calculation:**\n* We have: 2ab*c = 3 and d = 3/log\u2082(7)\n* Therefore, a * b * c * d = (3/2) * (3/log\u2082(7)) = **9/(2 * log\u2082(7))** \n**Note:**  The value of  log\u2082(7) is irrational, so we leave the answer in this form. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Express everything in terms of a common base:**\nSince we have powers of 4, 5, 6, and 7,  let's try to express them all in terms of a common base. Notice that 8 is a power of 2:\n*  $8 = 2^3$\n**2. Use the given equations to make substitutions:**\n*  Since $7^d = 8 = 2^3$, we have  $7 = 2^{3/d}$ \n*  Since $6^c = 7 = 2^{3/d}$, we have $6 = 2^{3/(cd)}$\n*  Since $5^b = 6 = 2^{3/(cd)}$, we have $5 = 2^{3/(bcd)}$\n*  Since $4^a = 5 = 2^{3/(bcd)}$, we have $4 = 2^{3/(abcd)}$\n**3.

Isolate the base 2.**\nWe want to get expressions where 2 is raised to a power. Let's manipulate the equations:\n*  **Equation 1:**  2^(2a) = 5  (This is already in the desired form)\n*  **Equation 2:**  5^b = 2 \u00d7 3.  We can rewrite this as:\n    *  2^(1/b) \u00d7 3^(1/b) = 5. Since 2^(2a) = 5, we can substitute to get:\n    *  2^(2a/b) \u00d7 3^(1/b) = 2^(2a)\n    *  This implies 2a/b = 1 and 3^(1/b) = 2^(2a). \n*  **Equation 3:** (2 \u00d7 3)^c = 7. We can rewrite this as:\n    *  2^(c) \u00d7 3^(c) = 7. Since 7^d = 2\u00b3, we can substitute to get:\n    *  2^(c) \u00d7 3^(c) = 2^(3d)\n    *  This implies c = 3d and 3^(c) = 2^(3d). \n*  **Equation 4:** 7^d = 2\u00b3 (This is already in the desired form)\n**4.

Find a * b * c * d**\nWe have a = b/2 and c = 3d.  We can substitute these into the product a * b * c * d:\na * b * c * d = (b/2) * b * (3d) * d = (3/2) * b\u00b2 * d\u00b2 \nNotice that the equation 3^(3d) = 2^(3d) tells us that 3^d = 2^d.  Since this is true for any non-zero value of d, we can conclude that d must be a positive integer.  Therefore, b\u00b2 * d\u00b2 is also a positive integer.\nSince we don't have enough information to find specific values for b and d,  the simplified answer for a * b * c * d is **(3/2) * b\u00b2 * d\u00b2, where b and d are positive integers.** \n"
