        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Geometry**\n* We have a circle with its center on the x-axis. This means the center will have coordinates of the form (c, 0), where 'c' is some number.\n* We are given two points on the circle: (-3, 2) and (-2, 3).\n**2. Use the Distance Formula**\n* The distance between the center of the circle (c, 0) and each of the given points is equal to the radius of the circle. We'll use the distance formula to find these distances:\n   * Distance between (c, 0) and (-3, 2):  \u221a[(c - (-3))^2 + (0 - 2)^2] = \u221a[(c + 3)^2 + 4]\n   * Distance between (c, 0) and (-2, 3): \u221a[(c - (-2))^2 + (0 - 3)^2] = \u221a[(c + 2)^2 + 9]\n**3. Set Up an Equation**\n* Since both distances represent the radius, they must be equal:\n   \u221a[(c + 3)^2 + 4] = \u221a[(c + 2)^2 + 9]\n**4. Solve for 'c'**\n* Square both sides of the equation: (c + 3)^2 + 4 = (c + 2)^2 + 9\n* Expand: c^2 + 6c + 9 + 4 = c^2 + 4c + 4 + 9\n* Simplify: 6c + 13 = 4c + 13\n* Solve for 'c': 2c = 0  =>  c = 0\n**5. Find the Radius**\n* Now that we know the center of the circle is (0, 0), we can use either of the given points and the distance formula to find the radius. Let's use (-3, 2):\n   * Radius = \u221a[(-3 - 0)^2 + (2 - 0)^2] = \u221a(9 + 4) = \u221a13\n**Therefore, the radius of the circle is \u221a13.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Situation**\nImagine a circle with its center on the x-axis.  Two points on the circle are given: (-3, 2) and (-2, 3).  \n**2. Understand Key Properties**\n* **Circle Definition:** A circle is the set of all points that are equidistant from a fixed point (the center).\n* **Center on the x-axis:** Since the center lies on the x-axis, its y-coordinate is 0.  Let's call the center's x-coordinate 'c'. So the center is (c, 0).\n**3. Use Distance Formula**\nThe distance between the center (c, 0) and each of the given points is the radius of the circle.  We can use the distance formula:\n* Distance between (c, 0) and (-3, 2) = \u221a[(c - (-3))^2 + (0 - 2)^2]\n* Distance between (c, 0) and (-2, 3) = \u221a[(c - (-2))^2 + (0 - 3)^2]\n**4. Set the Distances Equal**\nSince both distances represent the radius, they must be equal:\n\u221a[(c + 3)^2 + 4] = \u221a[(c + 2)^2 + 9]\n**5. Solve for 'c'**\n* Square both sides of the equation to get rid of the square roots.\n* Simplify and solve the resulting quadratic equation. You should get c = -5/2.\n**6. Calculate the Radius**\nNow that you know the center is (-5/2, 0), you can find the radius by calculating the distance from the center to either of the given points. Let's use (-3, 2):\nRadius = \u221a[(-5/2 - (-3))^2 + (0 - 2)^2] = \u221a(1/4 + 4) = \u221a(17/4) = \u221a17 / 2\n**Answer:** The radius of the circle is **\u221a17 / 2**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Situation**\nImagine a circle with its center on the x-axis. The points (-3, 2) and (-2, 3) lie on the circle.  This means the distance from the center to each of these points is the radius of the circle.\n**2.  Find the Midpoint**\nSince the center of the circle lies on the x-axis, the midpoint of the line segment connecting the two points (-3, 2) and (-2, 3) will give us the x-coordinate of the center.\n* The midpoint formula is:  ((x1 + x2)/2, (y1 + y2)/2)\n* Applying this to our points: ((-3 + -2)/2, (2 + 3)/2) = (-5/2, 5/2)\nSo, the x-coordinate of the center is -5/2.\n**3.  Find the Radius**\nWe now know the center of the circle is at (-5/2, 0).  We can use the distance formula to find the distance between this center and either of the given points. This distance will be the radius.\n* Distance formula: \u221a((x2 - x1)\u00b2 + (y2 - y1)\u00b2)\nLet's use the point (-3, 2):\n* Radius = \u221a((-3 - (-5/2))\u00b2 + (2 - 0)\u00b2) \n* Radius = \u221a((1/2)\u00b2 + (2)\u00b2)\n* Radius = \u221a(1/4 + 4)\n* Radius = \u221a(17/4) \n* Radius = \u221a17 / 2\n**Therefore, the radius of the circle is \u221a17 / 2.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Situation**\nImagine a circle with its center on the x-axis. The points (-3,2) and (-2,3) lie on this circle. This means the distances from the center of the circle to each of these points are equal (and represent the radius of the circle).\n**2.  Find the Midpoint**\nSince the center of the circle lies on the x-axis, the y-coordinate of the center will be 0.  The x-coordinate of the center will be the midpoint of the segment connecting the two given points.\nThe midpoint formula is:  [(x\u2081 + x\u2082)/2, (y\u2081 + y\u2082)/2]\nApplying this to our points: [(-3 + -2)/2, (2 + 3)/2] = (-5/2, 5/2)\nSince the center lies on the x-axis, the y-coordinate of the center is 0. Therefore, the center of the circle is  (-5/2, 0).\n**3. Calculate the Distance (Radius)**\nNow we can use the distance formula to find the distance between the center (-5/2, 0) and either of the points on the circle.  This distance will be the radius.\nThe distance formula is: \u221a[(x\u2082 - x\u2081)\u00b2 + (y\u2082 - y\u2081)\u00b2]\nLet's use the point (-3, 2):\n\u221a[(-3 - (-5/2))\u00b2 + (2 - 0)\u00b2] = \u221a[(1/2)\u00b2 + (2)\u00b2] = \u221a(1/4 + 4) = \u221a(17/4) = \u221a17 / 2\n**Answer:** The radius of the circle is **\u221a17 / 2**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Geometry**\n* The center of the circle lies on the x-axis, meaning its y-coordinate is 0. Let's call the center (h, 0).\n* The points (-3, 2) and (-2, 3) are on the circle, which means the distance from each point to the center (h, 0) is the same (and equal to the radius).\n**2. Use the Distance Formula**\n* The distance formula tells us the distance between two points: \n   \u221a[(x\u2082 - x\u2081)\u00b2 + (y\u2082 - y\u2081)\u00b2]\n* Let's find the distance between the center (h, 0) and the point (-3, 2):\n   \u221a[(h - (-3))\u00b2 + (0 - 2)\u00b2] = \u221a[(h + 3)\u00b2 + 4]\n* Now find the distance between the center (h, 0) and the point (-2, 3):\n   \u221a[(h - (-2))\u00b2 + (0 - 3)\u00b2] = \u221a[(h + 2)\u00b2 + 9]\n**3. Set up an Equation**\n* Since the distances are equal (the radius), we can set the two expressions equal to each other:\n   \u221a[(h + 3)\u00b2 + 4] = \u221a[(h + 2)\u00b2 + 9]\n**4. Solve for 'h'**\n* Square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square roots:\n   (h + 3)\u00b2 + 4 = (h + 2)\u00b2 + 9\n* Expand:\n   h\u00b2 + 6h + 9 + 4 = h\u00b2 + 4h + 4 + 9\n* Simplify:\n   2h = 0\n   h = 0\n**5. Find the Radius**\n* Now that we know h = 0, we can plug it back into either of the distance formulas to find the radius:\n    \u221a[(0 + 3)\u00b2 + 4] = \u221a(9 + 4) = \u221a13\n**Answer:** The radius of the circle is **\u221a13**. \n"
