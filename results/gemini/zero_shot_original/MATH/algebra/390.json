    "solution": "Let pile $A$ have $r_A$ red cards and $b_A$ black cards, and let pile $B$ have $r_B$ red cards and $b_B$ black cards. From the given information, we have  $$\\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll}\nr_A+r_B & = 26 \\\\\nb_A+b_B & = 26 \\\\\nb_A &= 6\\cdot r_A \\\\\nr_B &= m\\cdot b_B \\\\\n\\end{array} \\right.$$ for some positive integer $m.$ Substituting $6\\cdot r_A$ and $m\\cdot b_B$ for $b_A$ and $r_B,$ respectively, in the first two equations, we have $$\\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll}\nr_A+m\\cdot b_B & = 26 \\\\\n6\\cdot r_A+b_B & = 26.\n\\end{array} \\right.$$ Multiplying the first equation by 6 and subtracting, we get $$(6m-1)b_B=5\\cdot26=2\\cdot5\\cdot13.$$ Since $m$ is an integer, we have two possibilities: $b_B=2$ and $m=11,$ or $b_B=26$ and $m=1.$ The latter implies that pile $A$ is empty, which is contrary to the statement of the problem, so we conclude that $b_B=2$ and $m=11.$ Then, there are $r_B=m\\cdot b_B=11\\cdot2=\\boxed{22}$ red cards in pile $B.$",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Represent the Unknown Quantities**\n* Let  'r' represent the number of red cards in pile A.\n* Let 'b' represent the number of black cards in pile A.\n* Let 'x' represent the number of red cards in pile B.\n* Let 'y' represent the number of black cards in pile B.\n**2. Set Up Equations Based on the Given Information**\n* **Pile A:**  We know that there are six times as many black cards as red cards in pile A:  b = 6r \n* **Pile B:** We know that the number of red cards in pile B is a multiple of the number of black cards:  x = ky (where 'k' is some whole number)\n* **Total Cards:** We know the total number of red cards is 26 and the total number of black cards is 26:  r + x = 26 and b + y = 26\n**3. Solve the System of Equations**\n* **Substitute:** Since we know b = 6r, we can substitute that into the equation b + y = 26: 6r + y = 26 \n* **Isolate y:** Solve for y: y = 26 - 6r\n* **Consider Pile B:**  We know x = ky.  Since 'x' represents the number of red cards in pile B, and 'y' represents the number of black cards in pile B, 'x' must be a multiple of 'y'. \n* **Find Possible Values for y:** To find possible values for 'y', we need to find factors of 26 that are less than 26 (since there has to be at least one red card in pile B). The factors of 26 are 1, 2, 13, and 26.  The only factor less than 26 is 13.\n* **Solve for r:**  If y = 13, then from the equation y = 26 - 6r, we get 13 = 26 - 6r.  Solving for r, we get r = 2.\n* **Solve for x:** Since r = 2, we know b = 6r = 12.  This means there are 12 black cards in pile A.  Since there are 26 black cards total, there must be 14 black cards in pile B (26 - 12 = 14).  Since there are 13 red cards in pile B (y = 13), and the number of red cards is a multiple of the black cards, the number of red cards in pile B must be 13 * 2 = 26.\n**Answer:** There are **26** red cards in pile B. \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Represent the unknowns:**\n* Let  'r' be the number of red cards in pile A.\n* Let 'b' be the number of black cards in pile A.\n**2.  Set up equations based on the given information:**\n* **Pile A:** We know that there are six times as many black cards as red cards in pile A. This translates to:  b = 6r\n* **Pile B:** We know that the number of red cards in pile B is a multiple of the number of black cards. Since there are 26 red cards and 26 black cards total, we can express this as: 26 - r = k(26 - b), where 'k' is some whole number (representing the multiple).\n**3.  Solve for the number of red cards in pile B:**\n* **Substitute:** Since we know b = 6r, substitute this into the equation for pile B: 26 - r = k(26 - 6r)\n* **Simplify:** 26 - r = 26k - 6kr \n* **Rearrange:** 6kr - r = 26k - 26\n* **Factor out 'r':** r(6k - 1) = 26(k - 1)\n**4. Analyze the equation:**\n*  We know 'r' must be a whole number between 1 and 25 (since there's at least one red card in each pile). \n*  We also know 'k' is a whole number (representing a multiple).\n**5.  Find possible values for 'r' and 'k':**\n*  The only way for the equation to hold true is if (6k - 1) is a factor of 26. The factors of 26 are 1, 2, 13, and 26. \n*  Let's check the possibilities:\n    * If 6k - 1 = 1, then k = 1/3 (not a whole number, so this is not valid)\n    * If 6k - 1 = 2, then k = 1/2 (not a whole number, so this is not valid)\n    * If 6k - 1 = 13, then k = 7/3 (not a whole number, so this is not valid)\n    * If 6k - 1 = 26, then k = 27/6 = 9/2 (not a whole number, so this is not valid)\n**6.  Conclusion:**\nSince none of the possible values for 'k' satisfy the conditions, there is no solution that works for the problem. This means there's an error in the problem statement, and it's impossible to have a deck of cards split into two piles with the given conditions. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Ratios**\n* **Pile A:**  The ratio of black cards to red cards is 6:1. This means for every 1 red card in pile A, there are 6 black cards.\n* **Pile B:** The number of red cards is a multiple of the number of black cards. This means the number of black cards in pile B must divide evenly into the number of red cards in pile B.\n**2. Find Possible Combinations for Pile A**\nSince there are 26 red cards in total, the number of red cards in pile A must be a factor of 26. The factors of 26 are 1, 2, 13, and 26.  Let's see what happens with each possibility:\n* **If there's 1 red card in pile A:** There would be 6 black cards (6 times the number of red cards). This leaves 25 red cards and 20 black cards for pile B. \n* **If there are 2 red cards in pile A:** There would be 12 black cards. This leaves 24 red cards and 14 black cards for pile B.\n* **If there are 13 red cards in pile A:** There would be 78 black cards. This isn't possible since we only have 26 black cards in total.\n* **If there are 26 red cards in pile A:** This leaves no cards for pile B, which is not allowed.\n**3. Analyze Pile B**\nWe're left with two possible scenarios for pile B:\n* **Scenario 1:** 25 red cards and 20 black cards.  The number of red cards is not a multiple of the number of black cards.\n* **Scenario 2:** 24 red cards and 14 black cards. The number of red cards is a multiple of the number of black cards (24 is a multiple of 14).\n**4. The Answer**\nSince Scenario 2 satisfies the conditions for pile B, there are **24 red cards** in pile B. \n",

This means for every 1 red card in pile A, there are 6 black cards.\n* **Pile B:**  We know the number of red cards is a multiple of the number of black cards. This means the number of red cards in pile B can be expressed as *k* times the number of black cards (where *k* is a whole number).\n**2. Set up Equations**\nLet's use variables:\n*  Let *r* represent the number of red cards in pile A.\n*  Let *b* represent the number of black cards in pile A.\n*  Let *x* represent the number of red cards in pile B.\n*  Let *y* represent the number of black cards in pile B.\nWe can form the following equations based on the given information:\n* **Equation 1 (Pile A):**  *b* = 6*r*  (Black cards in A are 6 times the red cards in A)\n* **Equation 2 (Total Red Cards):**  *r* + *x* = 26  (Total red cards are 26)\n* **Equation 3 (Total Black Cards):** *b* + *y* = 26  (Total black cards are 26)\n* **Equation 4 (Pile B):** *x* = *k*y  (Red cards in B are a multiple of black cards in B)\n**3. Solve for *r* and *b***\nWe can solve for *r* and *b* using Equation 1 and the fact that there are 26 total black cards (Equation 3):\n* Substitute *b* = 6*r* into Equation 3: 6*r* + *y* = 26\n* Since *y* must be a whole number, we need to find a multiple of 6 that is less than 26.  The only possibility is 18 (6 * 3 = 18).\n* This means *y* = 8 (26 - 18 = 8)\n* Now we can solve for *r*: 6*r* = 18, so *r* = 3\n**4. Solve for *x***\n* Substitute *r* = 3 into Equation 2: 3 + *x* = 26\n* Therefore, *x* = 23\n**5. Determine the Number of Red Cards in Pile B**\n* We found that *x* = 23, which represents the number of red cards in pile B.\n**Answer:** There are **23** red cards in pile B. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Ratios**\n* **Pile A:**  The ratio of black cards to red cards is 6:1. This means for every 1 red card in pile A, there are 6 black cards. \n* **Pile B:** The number of red cards is a multiple of the number of black cards. This means the ratio of red cards to black cards in pile B can be written as  *k* : 1, where *k* is a whole number (1, 2, 3, ...).\n**2. Consider the Total Number of Cards**\n* We know there are 26 red cards and 26 black cards in total. \n* Since we have two piles, the total number of red cards in both piles must add up to 26, and the total number of black cards must add up to 26.\n**3. Set up Equations**\nLet's use variables to represent the number of cards in each pile:\n*  Let *x* represent the number of red cards in pile A.\n*  Let *y* represent the number of red cards in pile B.\n*  Since there are 6 times as many black cards as red cards in pile A, there are 6*x* black cards in pile A.\n*  Since the number of red cards in pile B is a multiple of the number of black cards, let *z* represent the number of black cards in pile B.  This means there are *z* * k* red cards in pile B.\nWe can now set up equations based on the total number of cards:\n* **Red cards:**  *x* + *y* = 26 \n* **Black cards:** 6*x* + *z* = 26\n**4. Solve for Possible Values**\nWe need to find values for *x*, *y*, and *z* that satisfy both equations and also fit the conditions of the problem (the ratios within each pile).\nLet's start by looking at the equation for red cards (*x* + *y* = 26).  Since both *x* and *y* must be whole numbers, we need to find pairs of numbers that add up to 26.  \n* **Possible values for x and y:** \n    * (x = 1, y = 25)\n    * (x = 2, y = 24)\n    * (x = 3, y = 23)\n    * ... and so on\n**5. Check for Consistency**\nNow, let's check if these possible values for *x* and *y* lead to valid solutions for the black cards and the ratios within each pile:\n* **Let's try (x = 1, y = 25)**\n    * In pile A: 1 red card and 6 black cards (ratio 1:6)\n    * In pile B: 25 red cards and some number of black cards (*z*) \n    * Since *y* (25) must be a multiple of *z*,  the only possible value for *z* is 1 (25/1 = 25). This would make the ratio in pile B 25:1. This works!\n* **Let's try (x = 2, y = 24)**\n    * In pile A: 2 red cards and 12 black cards (ratio 1:6)\n    * In pile B: 24 red cards and some number of black cards (*z*)\n    * To make *y* a multiple of *z*, we could have *z* = 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, or 12. However, none of these values for *z* would make the total number of black cards in both piles equal to 26. \n* **Let's try (x = 3, y = 23)**\n    * In pile A: 3 red cards and 18 black cards (ratio 1:6)\n    * In pile B: 23 red cards and some number of black cards (*z*)\n    * Again, none of the possible values for *z* to make *y* a multiple will work to make the total number of black cards equal 26.\n**6. The Answer**\nWe've found only one solution that works:\n* **Pile A:** 1 red card and 6 black cards \n* **Pile B:** 25 red cards and 1 black card \nTherefore, there are **25 red cards** in pile B. \n"
