    "solution": "First, we find the maximum height of the ball by maximizing the expression $-25t^2+75t+24$. We will do this by completing the square. Factoring a $-25$ from the first two terms, we have  \\[-25t^2+75t+24=-25(t^2-3t)+24\\]To complete the square, we add and subtract $\\left( -\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2=\\frac{9}{4}$ inside the parentheses to get \\begin{align*}\n-25(t^2-3t)+24&=-25\\left(t^2-3t+\\frac{9}{4}-\\frac{9}{4}\\right)+24\\\\\n&=-25\\left(\\left(t-\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2-\\frac{9}{4}\\right)+24\\\\\n&=-25\\left(t-\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2+\\frac{225}{4}+\\frac{96}{4}\\\\\n&=-25\\left(t-\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2+\\frac{321}{4}\n\\end{align*}Since $-25\\left(t-\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2$ is always non-positive, the maximum value of the expression is achieved when $-25\\left(t-\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2=0$. This happens when $t-\\frac{3}{2}=0$. Therefore the height of the ball is at its maximum when $t=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}$.",

        "Here's how to find the time at which the ball reaches its maximum height:\n**Understanding the Problem**\n* **Parabolic Path:** The equation  $-25t^2 + 75t + 24$ represents a parabola, which is the shape of the ball's path.\n* **Maximum Height:** We want to find the time (t) when the height is at its peak. This corresponds to the vertex of the parabola.\n**Finding the Time of Maximum Height**\n1. **Vertex Formula:** The x-coordinate (in our case, the time 't') of the vertex of a parabola in the form  *ax\u00b2 + bx + c* is given by the formula: \n   * t = -b / 2a\n2. **Apply the Formula:** In our equation,  a = -25 and b = 75. Let's plug these values into the formula:\n   * t = -75 / (2 * -25) = -75 / -50 = 1.5\n**Answer:** The ball reaches its maximum height at **1.5 seconds** after launch. \n",
        "Here's how to find the time when the ball reaches its maximum height:\n**1. Understanding the Equation**\nThe equation  -25t\u00b2 + 75t + 24 represents a parabola opening downwards (because the coefficient of the t\u00b2 term is negative). The maximum height occurs at the vertex of this parabola.\n**2. Finding the Vertex**\n* **Method 1: Completing the Square**\n   1. Factor out a -25 from the first two terms: -25(t\u00b2 - 3t) + 24\n   2. Take half of the coefficient of the t term (-3), square it (9/4), and add and subtract it inside the parentheses:  -25(t\u00b2 - 3t + 9/4 - 9/4) + 24\n   3. Rewrite the expression inside the parentheses as a squared term: -25(t - 3/2)\u00b2 + 25(9/4) + 24\n   4. Simplify: -25(t - 3/2)\u00b2 + 106.25\n   The vertex is at the point (3/2, 106.25).  The x-coordinate (3/2) represents the time when the maximum height is reached.\n* **Method 2: Using the Vertex Formula**\n   For a quadratic equation in the form of  at\u00b2 + bt + c, the x-coordinate of the vertex is given by:  -b / 2a\n   In our equation, a = -25 and b = 75.\n   Therefore, the time of maximum height is: -75 / (2 * -25) = 3/2 seconds.\n**Answer:**\nThe ball reaches its maximum height at **1.5 seconds** after launch. \n",
