        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Functional Equation**\nThe equation  $f(3x) = f(x) + 2$ tells us that if we triple the input of the function, the output increases by 2. \n**2. Use the Equation to Find More Values of f(x)**\n* **Start with f(3) = 5:** \n   * Let's use the equation with  x = 1.

Identify the Pattern**\nNotice that we're getting a sequence of outputs: 3, 5, 7, 9... This is an arithmetic sequence where each term is 2 more than the previous one. \n**4.  Find the Inverse Function**\n* We want to find  *f*\u207b\u00b9(11).  This means finding the input value *x* that gives us an output of 11.  \n* Since the output values of *f(x)* form an arithmetic sequence, we can determine the input that corresponds to an output of 11:\n    * The sequence is: 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, ... \n    * This means f(27) = 9, and since the outputs increase by 2 each time, f(36) = 11.\n* Therefore, *f*\u207b\u00b9(11) = 36\n**Answer:**  *f*\u207b\u00b9(11) = **36** \n",
