    "solution": "For this problem, we make use of the correspondence between sums/products of roots and coefficients of a polynomial.\n\nDenote the two roots of the equation $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. We know that $\\alpha\\beta = 48$, and $\\alpha/\\beta = 3 \\implies \\alpha = 3\\beta$.\n\nSo $ b = -\\alpha - \\beta = -4\\beta$. To maximize $b$, we want to make $\\beta$ negative and as large as possible. Given the relationship that $\\alpha = 3\\beta$ and that $\\alpha*\\beta = 48$, we see that $\\beta = 4$ or $-4$. Clearly $-4$ maximizes $b$, and $b = \\boxed{16}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Relationship Between Roots and Coefficients**\n* **Sum of roots:** For a quadratic equation of the form  ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0, the sum of the roots is -b/a.\n* **Product of roots:** For the same equation, the product of the roots is c/a.\n**2. Set Up Equations Based on the Given Information**\nLet the two roots of the equation be 3k and k (since they are in the ratio 3:1).\n* **Sum of roots:** 3k + k = -b/1  => 4k = -b\n* **Product of roots:** (3k)(k) = 48/1  => 3k\u00b2 = 48\n**3. Solve for k**\n*  Divide the product of roots equation by 3:  k\u00b2 = 16\n*  Take the square root of both sides: k = \u00b14\n**4. Find the Maximum Value of b**\n* Substitute k = 4 into the sum of roots equation: 4(4) = -b => b = -16\n* Substitute k = -4 into the sum of roots equation: 4(-4) = -b => b = 16\n**5. Determine the Largest Value**\nThe largest possible value of b is **16**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Define the Roots**\nSince the roots are in the ratio 3:1, let the roots be $3k$ and $k$ for some value of $k$.\n**2. Use Vieta's Formulas**\nVieta's formulas relate the coefficients of a polynomial to its roots. For a quadratic equation of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, we have:\n* **Sum of roots:**  -b/a\n* **Product of roots:** c/a\nIn our case, the sum of the roots is $(3k + k) = 4k$ and the product of the roots is $(3k)(k) = 3k^2$.  We also know that $a = 1$, $b = b$, and $c = 48$.\n**3. Apply Vieta's Formulas to our Equation**\n* **Sum of roots:** -b/1 = -b = 4k \n* **Product of roots:** 48/1 = 48 = 3k^2\n**4. Solve for k and b**\nFrom the product of roots equation, we get:\n*  k\u00b2 = 16\n*  k = \u00b14\nSince the sum of roots is -b, we want the largest possible value of b.  This occurs when k = -4.  Substituting this into the sum of roots equation:\n*  -b = 4(-4)\n*  b = 16\n**Therefore, the largest possible value of b is 16.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.

Solve the Equations**\n* From the sum of roots: 4k = -b  => b = -4k\n* From the product of roots: 3k\u00b2 = 48  => k\u00b2 = 16 => k = \u00b14 \n**5. Determine the Largest Value of b**\nSince k can be either 4 or -4, we have two possible values for b:\n* If k = 4, then b = -4(4) = -16\n* If k = -4, then b = -4(-4) = 16\n**Answer**\nThe largest possible value of b is **16**. \n",
