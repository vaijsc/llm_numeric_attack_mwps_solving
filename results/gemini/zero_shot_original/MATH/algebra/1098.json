    "problem": "The largest and smallest of three consecutive terms in an arithmetic sequence differ by 14. Half of the smallest term is added to each term and the sum of the resulting three numbers is 120. What is the value of the original smallest term?",

    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Call the three terms $a$, $a+d$, and $a+2d$, in increasing order. We are told that the largest and smallest terms differ by 14, so $(a+2d)-a=2d=14$ or $d=7$.\n\nAfter adding half the smallest term to each term, they become $\\frac32a$, $\\frac32a+7$, and $\\frac32a+14$. Their sum is $\\frac92a+21=120$, which gives $\\frac92a=99$ or $a=\\boxed{22}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Set up the equations:**\n* Let the smallest term be *a*.\n* Since the terms are consecutive in an arithmetic sequence, the middle term is *a + d* and the largest term is *a + 2d*, where *d* is the common difference.\n* We are given that the largest and smallest terms differ by 14:  *(a + 2d) - a = 14*\n* We are also given that half the smallest term added to each term sums to 120:  *(a/2 + a) + (a/2 + a + d) + (a/2 + a + 2d) = 120*\n**2. Simplify the equations:**\n* From the first equation, we get *2d = 14*, so *d = 7*.\n* From the second equation, we get *3a + 3d = 120*.\n**3. Solve for the smallest term (a):**\n* Substitute *d = 7* into the simplified second equation:  *3a + 3(7) = 120*\n* This simplifies to *3a + 21 = 120*.\n* Subtract 21 from both sides: *3a = 99*\n* Divide both sides by 3: *a = 33*\n**Therefore, the value of the original smallest term is 33.** \n",
