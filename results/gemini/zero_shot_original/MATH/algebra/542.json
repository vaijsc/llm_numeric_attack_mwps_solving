    "solution": "Consider two arbitrary polynomials $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ with highest degree terms $x^n$ and $x^m$, respectively. Then $p(q(x)) = (q(x))^n + \\cdots = (x^m + \\cdots)^n + \\cdots = x^{mn} + \\cdots$ is a polynomial of degree $mn$. It follows that $f(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree $18$.

        "Here's how we can break down the problem to find the degree of $h(x)$:\n**Understanding Degree and Composition**\n* **Degree of a polynomial:** The highest power of the variable in the polynomial. For example,  $x^3 + 2x - 1$ has a degree of 3.\n* **Composition of functions:**  When you plug one function into another, like  $f(g(x))$, the result is a new function. The degree of the composite function is affected by the degrees of the original functions.\n**Analyzing the Expression**\nLet's examine the expression:  $f(g(x)) + g(h(x)) + h(f(x))$\n* **Degree of  f(g(x))**:  Since  $f(x)$ has degree 6 and $g(x)$ has degree 3, the highest power of $x$ in $f(g(x))$ will be  $6 \\cdot 3 = 18$. This is because you're essentially substituting a polynomial of degree 3 into another polynomial of degree 6. \n* **Degree of g(h(x))**: Similarly, the highest power of $x$ in $g(h(x))$ will be  $3 \\cdot \\text{degree of } h(x)$.\n* **Degree of h(f(x))**: The highest power of $x$ in $h(f(x))$ will be  $\\text{degree of } h(x) \\cdot 6$.\n**Finding the Degree of h(x)**\nWe know the overall expression has a degree of 36.  To get a degree of 36, the dominant term (the term with the highest power) must come from one of the three terms in the expression. Let's consider the possibilities:\n1. **Dominant term is from  f(g(x))**: This is impossible because the degree of  $f(g(x))$ is only 18, which is less than 36.\n2. **Dominant term is from g(h(x))**: To get a degree of 36, we need  $3 \\cdot \\text{degree of } h(x) = 36$.  This means the degree of $h(x)$ would be 12.\n3. **Dominant term is from h(f(x))**: To get a degree of 36, we need  $\\text{degree of } h(x) \\cdot 6 = 36$.  This means the degree of $h(x)$ would be 6.\n**Conclusion**\nSince the degree of $h(x)$ cannot be both 12 and 6, the only way for the overall expression to have a degree of 36 is if the dominant term comes from  $h(f(x))$.  Therefore, the degree of the polynomial $h(x)$ must be **6**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Analyze the degrees of composite functions:**\n* **Degree of f(g(x)):**  The degree of a composite function like `f(g(x))` is found by multiplying the degrees of the individual functions. In this case, the degree of `f(g(x))` would be 6 * 3 = 18.\n* **Degree of g(h(x)):** Similarly, the degree of `g(h(x))` would be 3 * (degree of h(x)).\n* **Degree of h(f(x)):** The degree of `h(f(x))` would be (degree of h(x)) * 6.\n**2. Consider the sum:**\n* **Highest possible degree:** The highest possible degree of the sum `f(g(x)) + g(h(x)) + h(f(x))` occurs when we consider the terms with the highest degrees from each individual composite function.  This would be the degree of `f(g(x))`, which is 18.\n* **Degree of the sum must be 36:** We are given that the sum has a degree of 36. This means the degree of the term `g(h(x))` or `h(f(x))` must contribute to increasing the degree from 18 to 36.\n**3.  Determine the degree of h(x):**\n* To achieve a degree of 36, either `g(h(x))` or `h(f(x))` must have a degree of 18.\n* If `g(h(x))` has a degree of 18, then 3 * (degree of h(x)) = 18, which means the degree of `h(x)` is 6.\n* If `h(f(x))` has a degree of 18, then (degree of h(x)) * 6 = 18, which also means the degree of `h(x)` is 3.\n**Conclusion:**\nSince the degree of `h(x)` could be either 3 or 6, there are **two possible degrees** for the polynomial `h(x)`. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**Understanding the Concepts**\n* **Degree of a Polynomial:** The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of the variable in the polynomial. \n* **Composition of Functions:**  When we compose functions, like in  `f(g(x))`, we substitute the entire expression for `g(x)` into the function `f(x)`. \n**Reasoning**\n1. **Degree of `f(g(x))`:**  When we substitute a polynomial of degree 3 (`g(x)`) into a polynomial of degree 6 (`f(x)`) the highest power of `x` will be multiplied by itself 6 times.  This means the degree of `f(g(x))` will be 3 * 6 = 18.\n2. **Degree of `g(h(x))`:** The degree of `g(h(x))` will be determined by the degree of `h(x)`.  Since `g(x)` has a degree of 3, the highest power of `x` in `h(x)` will be multiplied by 3.  Let's call the degree of `h(x)` as `n`.  So, the degree of `g(h(x))` will be 3 * n.\n3. **Degree of `h(f(x))`:** Similarly, the degree of `h(f(x))` will be 6 * n, as the highest power of `x` in `f(x)` is 6.\n4. **Total Degree:**  To find the degree of the entire expression, we need to consider the highest power of `x` that results from combining the three terms: \n    * `f(g(x))`: Degree 18\n    * `g(h(x))`: Degree 3 * n\n    * `h(f(x))`: Degree 6 * n\n5. **Finding the Degree of `h(x)`:** The problem states that the total degree of the expression is 36.  This means:\n    18 + 3n + 6n = 36\n    Solving for `n`, we get:\n    9n = 18\n    n = 2\n**Answer**\nTherefore, the degree of the polynomial `h(x)` is **2**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**Understanding the Problem**\nWe're given information about the degrees of three polynomials, *f(x)*, *g(x)*, and *h(x)*. We need to find the degree of *h(x)*. The key is to understand how the degrees of polynomials change when we perform operations like composition.\n**Key Concepts**\n* **Degree of a polynomial:** The highest power of the variable in the polynomial.\n* **Composition of functions:**  For functions *f(x)* and *g(x)*, the composition *f(g(x))* means we substitute the entire function *g(x)* in place of *x* in *f(x)*.\n* **Degree of a composition:** The degree of *f(g(x))* is the product of the degrees of *f(x)* and *g(x)*.\n**Solving the Problem**\n1. **Analyze the terms:**\n   * *f(g(x))*: The degree of this term is 6 * 3 = 18 (since the degree of *f(x)* is 6 and the degree of *g(x)* is 3).\n   * *g(h(x))*: The degree of this term is 3 * degree of *h(x)*.\n   * *h(f(x))*: The degree of this term is degree of *h(x)* * 6.\n2. **Consider the total degree:**\n   The problem states that the degree of the entire expression *f(g(x)) + g(h(x)) + h(f(x))* is 36.  Since we're adding polynomials, the degree of the sum is determined by the term with the highest degree.\n3. **Set up an inequality:** \n   For the degree of the entire expression to be 36, the highest degree term must be either 3 * degree of *h(x)* or degree of *h(x)* * 6. This leads to the following inequality:\n   \n   ```\n   max(3 * degree of h(x), degree of h(x) * 6) = 36\n   ```\n4. **Solve for the degree of *h(x)*:**\n   * If 3 * degree of *h(x)* = 36, then the degree of *h(x)* = 12.\n   * If degree of *h(x)* * 6 = 36, then the degree of *h(x)* = 6.\n**Conclusion**\nThe degree of the polynomial *h(x)* could be either **6** or **12**.
