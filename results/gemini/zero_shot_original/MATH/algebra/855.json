        "We can expand this expression using the distributive property (sometimes called FOIL for \"First, Outer, Inner, Last\").  Here's how it works:\n1. **Multiply the first term of the first trinomial by each term of the second trinomial:** \n   \n   *  $z^2 \\cdot z^3 = z^5$\n   *  $z^2 \\cdot 4z = 4z^3$\n   *  $z^2 \\cdot -2 = -2z^2$\n2. **Multiply the second term of the first trinomial by each term of the second trinomial:**\n   * $-3z \\cdot z^3 = -3z^4$\n   * $-3z \\cdot 4z = -12z^2$\n   * $-3z \\cdot -2 = 6z$\n3. **Multiply the third term of the first trinomial by each term of the second trinomial:**\n   * $2 \\cdot z^3 = 2z^3$\n   * $2 \\cdot 4z = 8z$\n   * $2 \\cdot -2 = -4$\n4. **Combine all the terms:**\n   $z^5 + 4z^3 - 2z^2 - 3z^4 - 12z^2 + 6z + 2z^3 + 8z - 4$\n5. **Combine like terms:**\n   $z^5 - 3z^4 + 6z^3 - 14z^2 + 14z - 4$\n**Therefore, the expanded form of $(z^2 -3z+2)(z^3 + 4z-2)$ is $z^5 - 3z^4 + 6z^3 - 14z^2 + 14z - 4$.** \n",
