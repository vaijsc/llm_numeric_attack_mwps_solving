    "solution": "We use the distance formula: $\\sqrt{(2 - (-3))^2 + ((-5) - 7)^2} = \\sqrt{25 + 144} = \\boxed{13}$.\n\n- OR -\n\nWe note that the points $(-3, 7)$, $(2, -5)$, and $(-3, -5)$ form a right triangle with legs of length 5 and 12. This is a Pythagorean triple, so the hypotenuse has length $\\boxed{13}$.",
