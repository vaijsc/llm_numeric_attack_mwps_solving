    "problem": "Daniel works at an electronics store, and he claims that the popularity of a television (measured in number of sales) is inversely proportional to its cost. If 15 customers buy a television that costs $\\$$1500, according to Daniel's theory, how many customers would buy a television that costs $\\$$2500?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let the popularity of a television (or the number of customers who buy one) equal $p$, and let the cost of the television equal $c$. According to Daniel's theory, $p$ and $c$ are inversely proportional. Thus, $(p)(c)=k$ for some constant value $k$. If $p=15$ when $c=1500$, then $k=(15)(1500)=22500$. So when $c=2500$, \\begin{align*} (p)(c)&=k\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad (p)(2500)&=22500\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad p&=\\frac{22500}{2500}\n\\\\ &=\\boxed{9}.\n\\end{align*}According to Daniel's theory, 9 customers would buy the $\\$2500$ television.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand Inverse Proportionality:**\n* Inverse proportionality means that as one quantity increases, the other decreases at a rate that keeps their product constant. In this case, as the cost of the TV increases, the number of customers buying it decreases.\n**2. Set up the Equation:**\n* Let 'x' represent the number of customers who would buy a $2500 TV. \n* We know the product of cost and number of customers is constant.  This can be written as:\n   1500 * 15 = 2500 * x \n**3. Solve for x:**\n* Simplify the equation: 22500 = 2500x\n* Divide both sides by 2500: x = 9\n**Answer:** According to Daniel's theory, 9 customers would buy a television that costs $2500. \n",
