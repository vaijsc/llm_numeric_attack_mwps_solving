    "problem": "In a rectangular coordinate system, the line $5y = 2x$ intersects the line $3x - 4y = 7$ at point $Z$. What is the sum of the coordinates of point $Z$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "From the first equation, we can see that $x = \\frac{5}{2}y$. Substituting for $x$ in the second equation, we obtain $3\\left(\\frac{5}{2}y\\right) - 4y = 7$, which reduces to $y = 2$. Solving for $x$, we find that $x = 5$. Therefore, $Z = (5, 2)$ and our answer is $5 + 2 = \\boxed{7}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Solve for one variable in terms of the other:**\n* From the equation  $5y = 2x$, we can solve for  $y$: \n   $y = \\frac{2}{5}x$\n**2. Substitute into the second equation:**\n* Substitute this expression for  $y$ into the second equation:\n   $3x - 4\\left(\\frac{2}{5}x\\right) = 7$\n**3. Solve for x:**\n* Simplify the equation:\n   $3x - \\frac{8}{5}x = 7$\n   $\\frac{7}{5}x = 7$\n   $x = 5$\n**4. Solve for y:**\n* Substitute the value of $x$ back into either of the original equations. Let's use  $5y = 2x$:\n   $5y = 2(5)$\n   $5y = 10$\n   $y = 2$\n**5.

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Solve for one variable in terms of the other in each equation:**\n* **Equation 1:**  5y = 2x  =>  y = (2/5)x\n* **Equation 2:** 3x - 4y = 7  =>  y = (3/4)x - 7/4\n**2. Set the expressions for 'y' equal to each other:**\nSince both expressions represent the y-coordinate at the point of intersection, we can set them equal:\n(2/5)x = (3/4)x - 7/4\n**3. Solve for 'x':**\n* Multiply both sides by 20 (the least common multiple of 5 and 4) to get rid of fractions: 8x = 15x - 35\n* Subtract 15x from both sides: -7x = -35\n* Divide both sides by -7: x = 5\n**4. Substitute the value of 'x' back into either equation to find 'y':**\nLet's use Equation 1: \n* y = (2/5) * 5\n* y = 2\n**5.
