    "problem": "Together, Amy and Betty have 20 apples. Amy has three times the number of apples that Betty has. How many more apples than Betty does Amy have?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Call the amount of apples Amy has $a$ and the amount of apples Betty has $b$. We can use the following system of equations to represent the given information: \\begin{align*}\na + b &= 20 \\\\\na &= 3b \\\\\n\\end{align*}Substituting for $a$ into the first equation gives $3b + b = 20$. Solving for $b$ gives $b = 5$. Thus $a = 15$. So Amy has $15 - 5 = \\boxed{10}$ more apples than Betty.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step by step:\n**1. Set up variables:**\n* Let 'x' represent the number of apples Betty has.\n* Amy has three times as many as Betty, so Amy has 3x apples.\n**2. Write an equation:**\n* Together they have 20 apples: x + 3x = 20\n**3. Solve for x:**\n* Combine like terms: 4x = 20\n* Divide both sides by 4: x = 5  (Betty has 5 apples)\n**4. Calculate Amy's apples:**\n* Amy has 3x apples, so she has 3 * 5 = 15 apples.\n**5. Find the difference:**\n* Amy has 15 - 5 = 10 more apples than Betty.\n**Answer:** Amy has 10 more apples than Betty. \n",
