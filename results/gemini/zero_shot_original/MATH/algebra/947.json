        "Here's how to solve the problem step by step:\n**1. Understand the Problem**\nWe're looking for quadratic polynomials of the form  x\u00b2 + mx + n, where:\n* **n = 28** (a constant term)\n* **The roots are positive integers.** This means the polynomial can be factored into (x - r)(x - s) where r and s are positive integers.\n**2. Factor the Constant Term**\nSince n = 28, we need to find all the pairs of positive integers that multiply to 28. These are:\n* 1 and 28\n* 2 and 14\n* 4 and 7\n**3. Connect Factors to Roots**\nRemember that the factored form of a quadratic is (x - r)(x - s), where r and s are the roots.  So, each pair of factors we found corresponds to a possible set of roots:\n* (x - 1)(x - 28)  \n* (x - 2)(x - 14)\n* (x - 4)(x - 7)\n**4. Count the Polynomials**\nWe have found three distinct sets of roots, each leading to a different polynomial. \n**Answer:** There are **3** polynomials of the form x\u00b2 + mx + n with positive integer roots and n = 28. \n",

Relate factors to roots and the middle term:**\n* The roots of the polynomial are the factors of 28. \n* The coefficient *m* in the middle term (*mx*) is the negative sum of the roots.\n**4. Test the factor pairs:**\n* **Pair 1 (1 and 28):** \n    * Sum of roots: 1 + 28 = 29 \n    * Middle term: -29x \n    * Polynomial: x\u00b2 - 29x + 28\n* **Pair 2 (2 and 14):**\n    * Sum of roots: 2 + 14 = 16\n    * Middle term: -16x\n    * Polynomial: x\u00b2 - 16x + 28\n* **Pair 3 (4 and 7):**\n    * Sum of roots: 4 + 7 = 11\n    * Middle term: -11x\n    * Polynomial: x\u00b2 - 11x + 28\n**5.

Factor the constant term:**\nSince the constant term is 28, we need to find pairs of factors of 28 that could represent the roots of the polynomial. The factors of 28 are:\n* 1 and 28\n* 2 and 14\n* 4 and 7\n**3. Check if the factors satisfy the conditions:**\n* **Root-coefficient relationship:**  In a quadratic equation of the form ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0, the sum of the roots is -b/a and the product of the roots is c/a. \n* In our case, a = 1, b = m (unknown), and c = 28.\n* The product of the roots should be 28/1 = 28.  This confirms our factor pairs are correct.\n**4. Determine the value of 'm' for each factor pair:**\n* **1 and 28:** The sum of the roots (1 + 28) = 29.  Since the sum of the roots is -m, we have m = -29.  This doesn't satisfy the condition of positive integer roots.\n* **2 and 14:** The sum of the roots (2 + 14) = 16.  Therefore, m = -16.  Again, this doesn't satisfy the condition of positive integer roots.\n* **4 and 7:** The sum of the roots (4 + 7) = 11.  Therefore, m = -11.  This doesn't satisfy the condition of positive integer roots.\n**5. Conclusion:**\nNone of the factor pairs of 28 result in a value of 'm' that satisfies the condition of positive integer roots.  Therefore, there are **no** polynomials of the form x\u00b2 + mx + 28 with positive integer roots. \n",
