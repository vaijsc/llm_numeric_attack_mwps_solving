    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The radius of the circular path of the horse closer to the center is $\\frac{1}{4}$ of the radius of the path of the horse farther from the center.  Since circumference is directly proportional to radius, the length of shorter path is $\\frac{1}{4}$ of the length of the longer path.  Therefore, 4 times as many revolutions must be made to go the same distance, which is $27\\times4=\\boxed{108}$ revolutions.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the circumference of the circle the first horse travels:**\n* The radius of the first horse's circle is 64 feet.\n* The circumference of a circle is calculated using the formula:  Circumference = 2 * \u03c0 * radius\n* Circumference = 2 * \u03c0 * 64 feet \u2248 402.12 feet\n**2. Calculate the total distance the first horse travels:**\n* The first horse makes 27 revolutions.\n* Total distance = Circumference * Number of revolutions \n* Total distance \u2248 402.12 feet/revolution * 27 revolutions \u2248 10857.24 feet\n**3. Find the circumference of the circle the second horse travels:**\n* The radius of the second horse's circle is 16 feet.\n* Circumference = 2 * \u03c0 * 16 feet \u2248 100.53 feet\n**4. Determine how many revolutions the second horse needs to make:**\n* We know the second horse needs to travel the same distance as the first horse (10857.24 feet).\n* Number of revolutions = Total distance / Circumference\n* Number of revolutions \u2248 10857.24 feet / 100.53 feet/revolution \u2248 **108 revolutions**\n**Therefore, the horse 16 feet from the center would have to make approximately 108 revolutions to travel the same distance.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step by step:\n**1. Find the circumference of the outer circle:**\n* The horse 64 feet from the center travels in a circle with a radius of 64 feet.\n* Circumference = 2 * pi * radius = 2 * pi * 64 feet \u2248 402.12 feet\n**2. Calculate the total distance traveled by the outer horse:**\n* The outer horse makes 27 revolutions.\n* Total distance = Circumference * Number of revolutions \u2248 402.12 feet/revolution * 27 revolutions \u2248 10857.24 feet\n**3. Find the circumference of the inner circle:**\n* The horse 16 feet from the center travels in a circle with a radius of 16 feet.\n* Circumference = 2 * pi * radius = 2 * pi * 16 feet \u2248 100.53 feet\n**4. Calculate the number of revolutions for the inner horse:**\n* The inner horse needs to travel the same distance as the outer horse (\u2248 10857.24 feet).\n* Number of revolutions = Total distance / Circumference \u2248 10857.24 feet / 100.53 feet/revolution \u2248 108 revolutions\n**Answer:** The horse 16 feet from the center would have to make approximately **108 revolutions** to travel the same distance. \n",
