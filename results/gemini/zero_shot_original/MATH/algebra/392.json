The ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay is (16 + x) / (12 - x).\n**2.

        "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n**Understanding the Ratios**\n* **Scenario 1:** Denali walks 16 dogs and Nate walks 12 dogs. This ratio of their dogs is 16:12, which simplifies to 4:3. \n* **Scenario 2:** Denali walks 16 + 4x dogs and Nate walks 12 dogs.  \n* **Scenario 3:** Denali walks 16 + x dogs and Nate walks 12 - x dogs.\n**The Key: Equal Pay Ratios**\nThe problem states that the ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay is the same in all three scenarios. Since pay is directly proportional to the number of dogs walked, this means the ratios of dogs walked must also be equal.\n**Setting Up Equations**\nWe can set up two equations based on the ratios:\n* **Scenario 1 vs. Scenario 2:**  4/(3) = (16 + 4x)/12 \n* **Scenario 1 vs. Scenario 3:** 4/(3) = (16 + x)/(12 - x)\n**Solving for x**\nLet's solve the first equation:\n1. Cross-multiply: 4 * 12 = 3 * (16 + 4x)\n2. Simplify: 48 = 48 + 12x\n3. Subtract 48 from both sides: 0 = 12x\n4. Divide both sides by 12: x = 0\nThis solution is not valid because the problem states that x \u2260 0.\nNow let's solve the second equation:\n1. Cross-multiply: 4 * (12 - x) = 3 * (16 + x)\n2. Simplify: 48 - 4x = 48 + 3x\n3. Subtract 48 from both sides: -4x = 3x\n4. Add 4x to both sides: 0 = 7x\n5. Divide both sides by 7: x = 0\nAgain, we get x = 0, which is not a valid solution.\n**Conclusion**\nThere is no solution for x that satisfies the conditions of the problem. This means that the company's new policy cannot achieve the desired pay ratio regardless of the size of the groups (x). \n",
        "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n**1. Understanding the Pay Ratio**\n* The problem states that the ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay remains the same in two different scenarios. This means the *proportion* of their pay is constant, regardless of the number of dogs they walk.\n**2. Setting up the Scenarios**\n* **Scenario 1:** Denali walks 16 + 4x dogs, and Nate walks 12 dogs.\n* **Scenario 2:** Denali walks 16 + x dogs, and Nate walks 12 - x dogs.\n**3. Expressing the Pay Ratio**\nLet's assume:\n* Denali's pay per dog is 'd'\n* Nate's pay per dog is 'n'\nNow we can express the pay ratio in each scenario:\n* **Scenario 1:** Denali's pay / Nate's pay = (16 + 4x)d / 12n\n* **Scenario 2:** Denali's pay / Nate's pay = (16 + x)d / (12 - x)n\n**4. Equating the Ratios**\nSince the pay ratios are equal in both scenarios, we can set the two expressions equal to each other:\n(16 + 4x)d / 12n = (16 + x)d / (12 - x)n\n**5. Solving for x**\nNow we have an equation with one unknown (x). Let's simplify and solve:\n* Notice that 'd' and 'n' appear on both sides, so they cancel out.\n* Cross-multiply: (16 + 4x)(12 - x) = 12(16 + x)\n* Expand: 192 + 48x - 16x - 4x\u00b2 = 192 + 12x\n* Simplify: 4x\u00b2 - 20x = 0\n* Factor out 4x: 4x(x - 5) = 0\n* Therefore, x = 0 or x = 5\n**6. Final Answer**\nThe problem states that x \u2260 0. Therefore, the only valid solution is **x = 5**. \n",
