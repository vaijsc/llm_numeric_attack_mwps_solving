        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Recognize the Pattern**\nThe expression on the left-hand side is an infinite nested radical.  We can represent this pattern more compactly:\nLet  \n  *  y =  \u221a(x + \u221a(x + \u221a(x + ...))) \nNotice that the expression inside the square root is the same as the original expression, 'y'.  This means we can write:\n  * y = \u221a(x + y)\n**2.

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\nThe expression  $\\sqrt{x + \\sqrt{x + \\sqrt{x + \\ldots}}}$ is a bit tricky.
