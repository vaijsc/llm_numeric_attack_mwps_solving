        "Here's how to solve for *x* step-by-step:\n1. **Cross-multiply:** \n   Multiply both sides of the equation by  2\u221a(x-1) and 3\u221ax to get rid of the fractions:\n   \n   2\u221a(x-1) * \u221ax = 3\u221ax * \u221a(x-1)\n2. **Simplify:**\n   \u221a(x-1) * \u221ax = \u221a(x(x-1))  (This is based on the property \u221aa * \u221ab = \u221a(ab))\n   \n   The equation now becomes:\n   2\u221a(x(x-1)) = 3\u221a(x(x-1))\n3. **Solve for x:**\n   Since both sides of the equation have the same square root term, we can divide both sides by \u221a(x(x-1)) (as long as x(x-1) is not equal to 0):\n   \n   2 = 3\n   This is a contradiction, which means there is **no solution** for *x* that satisfies the original equation. \n",
        "1. **Cross-multiply:** To get rid of the fractions, multiply both sides of the equation by the denominators: \n   2 * \u221ax = 3 * \u221a(x-1)\n2. **Square both sides:** To get rid of the square roots, square both sides of the equation:\n   (2\u221ax)\u00b2 = (3\u221a(x-1))\u00b2\n   4x = 9(x-1)\n3. **Simplify and solve for x:** \n   4x = 9x - 9\n   9 = 5x\n   x = 9/5\nTherefore, the solution is **x = 9/5**. \n",

This means the equation is true for any value of *x* where the original equation is defined. \n4. **Consider the restrictions:**\n   The original equation has restrictions on the values of *x* because we can't take the square root of a negative number and the denominator can't be zero.\n   * **\u221ax:**  This means *x* must be greater than or equal to 0.\n   * **\u221a(x-1):** This means *x* must be greater than or equal to 1.\n   * **x - 1 \u2260 0:** This means *x* cannot be equal to 1.\n5. **Solution:**\n   Combining all restrictions, the solution is **x > 1**.  We can't express this as a single fraction, but we can express it in interval notation as **(1, \u221e)**. \n",
        "1. **Cross-multiply:**  \n   Multiply both sides of the equation by $2\\sqrt{x-1}$ and by $\\sqrt{x}$: \n   \n   $$2\\sqrt{x}\\sqrt{x-1} = 3\\sqrt{x}\\sqrt{x-1}$$\n2. **Simplify:**\n   Cancel out $\\sqrt{x}\\sqrt{x-1}$ from both sides (as long as it's not zero):\n   $$2 = 3$$\n   This is a contradiction.  We can't have 2 equal to 3.  Therefore, there is **no solution** to the equation. \n",
        "Here's how to solve for *x*:\n1. **Cross-multiply:**\n   (\u221ax) * 2 = 3 * (\u221a(x-1))\n2. **Simplify:**\n   2\u221ax = 3\u221a(x-1)\n3. **Square both sides:**\n   (2\u221ax)\u00b2 = (3\u221a(x-1))\u00b2\n   4x = 9(x-1)\n4. **Distribute:**\n   4x = 9x - 9\n5. **Solve for x:**\n   -5x = -9\n   x = 9/5\nTherefore, the solution is  **x = 9/5**. \n"
