    "solution": "The sum of the first $n$ odd integers is $1 + 3 + \\dots + (2n - 1)$.  The sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, so this sum is $[1 + (2n - 1)]/2 \\cdot n = n^2$.\n\nThen the sum of the odd integers between 0 and 100 is $50^2$, and the sum of the odd integers between 0 and 200 is $100^2$.  Therefore, the ratio of the sum of the odd integers between 0 and 100 to the sum of the odd integers between 100 and 200 is $\\frac{50^2}{100^2-50^2}=\\frac{1}{4-1}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Find the sums**\n* **Sum of odd integers between 0 and 100:**  This is an arithmetic series with first term 1, common difference 2, and last term 99.  The sum of an arithmetic series is  (number of terms)*(average of first and last term).  There are 50 odd numbers between 0 and 100.  So, the sum is  50 * (1 + 99)/2 = 50 * 50 = 2500.\n* **Sum of odd integers between 100 and 200:**  This is also an arithmetic series with first term 101, common difference 2, and last term 199.  There are 50 odd numbers between 100 and 200.  So, the sum is 50 * (101 + 199)/2 = 50 * 150 = 7500.\n**2. Find the ratio**\nThe ratio of the sum of the odd integers between 0 and 100 to the sum of the odd integers between 100 and 200 is 2500/7500.\n**3.

The sum of an arithmetic series is (number of terms/2) * (first term + last term).

The formula for the nth term of an arithmetic series is a + (n-1)d, where d is the common difference.  So 99 = 1 + (n-1)2.  Solving for n, we get n = 50.\n* Therefore, the sum of the odd integers between 0 and 100 is (50/2)(1 + 99) = 2500.\n**2.
