    "solution": "In Sally's arrangement, the number of candies is $ab+2a+b$. In Rita's arrangement, the number of candies is $\\left(5a-4\\right)\\left(\\frac{b-1}{3}\\right)$. The number of candies didn't change, so these two expressions are equal.  Therefore,  \\begin{align*}\nab+2a+b&=(5a-4)\\left(\\frac{b-1}{3}\\right) \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\\n3ab+6a+3b&=(5a-4)(b-1)\\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\\n3ab+6a+3b&=5ab-4b-5a+4\\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\\n0&=2ab-7b-11a+4\\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\\n-4&=b(2a-7)-11a\\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\\n-4+\\frac{11}{2}(7)&=b(2a-7)-\\frac{11}{2}(2a-7)\\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\\n\\frac{-8}{2}+\\frac{77}{2}&=\\left(b-\\frac{11}{2}\\right)(2a-7)\\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\\n69&=(2b-11)(2a-7).\n\\end{align*}The prime factorization of $69$ is $3\\cdot 23$. So we have the following possibilities. \\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c|c}\n$2a-7$&$2b-11$&$2a$&$2b$&$a$&$b$\\\\ \\hline\n$1$&$69$&$8$&$80$&$4$&$40$\\\\\n$3$&$23$&$10$&$34$&$5$&$17$\\\\\n$23$&$3$&$30$&$14$&$15$&$7$\\\\\n$69$&$1$&$76$&$12$&$38$&$6$\n\\end{tabular}We know from above, since Rita's arrangement must have integral dimensions, that $b-1$ is divisible by $3$. A check shows that the pairs $(a,b)$ that don't work are $(5,17)$ and $(38,6)$. Thus we have either $(a,b)=(15,7)$ or $(a,b)=(4,40)$. There are $ab+2a+b$ candies. In this first case we have $(15)(7)+2(15)+7=142$ candies. In the second case there are $(4)(40)+2(4)+40=208$ candies. Thus the maximum number of candies that could be in Sally's bag is $\\boxed{208}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Set up equations based on the given information:**\n* **Sally's arrangement:** The total number of candies Sally has is represented by  `ab + 2a + b`. \n* **Rita's arrangement:** The total number of candies Rita arranges is represented by `(5a-4)(b-1)/3`. \nSince both arrangements represent the same total number of candies, we can set these two expressions equal to each other:\n`(5a-4)(b-1)/3 = ab + 2a + b`\n**2. Simplify the equation:**\n* Expand the left side of the equation: \n   `(5ab - 5a - 4b + 4)/3 = ab + 2a + b`\n* Multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to get rid of the fraction: \n   `5ab - 5a - 4b + 4 = 3ab + 6a + 3b`\n* Combine like terms:\n   `2ab - 11a - 7b + 4 = 0`\n**3. Factor the equation:**\n* Notice that the equation can be factored by grouping:\n   `2a(b - 5.5) - 7(b - 5.5) = 0`\n* Factor out the common term `(b - 5.5)`:\n   `(b - 5.5)(2a - 7) = 0`\n**4. Solve for possible values of a and b:**\n* For the product of two factors to be zero, at least one of the factors must be zero.  So we have two possibilities:\n    * `b - 5.5 = 0`, which means `b = 5.5`\n    * `2a - 7 = 0`, which means `a = 3.5`\n**5. Determine the valid solution:**\n* Since we are dealing with a grid of candies, the number of rows and columns must be whole numbers. Therefore, the solution `b = 5.5` is not valid.\n* The solution `a = 3.5` is also not valid because it would result in a fractional number of rows in Sally's arrangement.\n**6. Consider the limitations:**\n* The problem states that Rita has no candies leftover. This implies that `b - 1` must be divisible by 3. \n* Since we found that `a = 3.5` is not a valid solution, we need to find values of `b` that make `(5a-4)(b-1)/3` a whole number, while also ensuring that `b - 1` is divisible by 3. \n**7. Find a suitable value for b:**\n* We can start by trying values of `b` that are one more than a multiple of 3:\n    * If `b = 4`, then `(b-1)/3 = 1` and `(5a-4)(b-1)/3 = (5*3.5 - 4)*1 = 13.5`, which is not a whole number.\n    * If `b = 7`, then `(b-1)/3 = 2` and `(5a-4)(b-1)/3 = (5*3.5 - 4)*2 = 27`, which is a whole number.\n**8. Calculate the maximum number of candies:**\n* Now that we have a valid value for `b`, we can find the maximum number of candies Sally has:\n    * `ab + 2a + b = (3.5 * 7) + (2 * 3.5) + 7 = 24.5 + 7 + 7 = 38.5`\n**9. Since we are dealing with whole candies, the maximum number of candies in Sally's bag is 38.** \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem step by step:\n**1. Understand the Information:**\n* **Sally's arrangement:** Sally arranges her candies in a grid with 'a' rows and 'b' columns. This means she has a total of 'a * b' candies in the grid. She also has 2a + b leftover candies.\n* **Rita's arrangement:** Rita arranges the candies in a grid with '5a - 4' rows and '(b - 1)/3' columns.  She has no candies leftover, meaning all candies fit perfectly into this grid.\n**2. Set Up Equations:**\n* **Sally's total candies:**  Total = (a * b) + (2a + b)\n* **Rita's total candies:** Total = (5a - 4) * ((b - 1)/3)\n**3. Key Observation:**\nSince both Sally and Rita have the same number of candies, we can equate their total candy expressions:\n(a * b) + (2a + b) = (5a - 4) * ((b - 1)/3)\n**4. Simplify the Equation:**\n* Expand both sides of the equation: ab + 2a + b = (5ab - 5a - 4b + 4)/3\n* Multiply both sides by 3: 3ab + 6a + 3b = 5ab - 5a - 4b + 4\n* Rearrange terms: 2ab - 11a - 7b + 4 = 0\n**5. Finding a Solution:**\nUnfortunately, we can't solve for specific values of 'a' and 'b' directly from this equation. It's a quadratic equation in two variables. \n**6. Finding the Maximum Number of Candies:**\nTo find the maximum number of candies, we need to maximize the expression for Sally's total candies:\nTotal = (a * b) + (2a + b)\nWe can't maximize this expression directly because of the constraints of the equation in step 4. However, we can look for values of 'a' and 'b' that satisfy the equation and lead to a large value for the total.\n**7. Trial and Error (and a Little Insight):**\n* **Focus on 'a' and 'b' being integers:** Since we're dealing with candies, 'a' and 'b' must be whole numbers.\n* **Try small values of 'a' and 'b':** Start with small values and see if they satisfy the equation in step 4.  \n* **Note:** The equation in step 4 suggests that 'a' and 'b' should be relatively large to make the terms on the left side significant.\nBy trying out different values, we can find solutions that work.  For example:\n* If a = 5 and b = 11, the equation in step 4 is satisfied. This gives us a total of (5 * 11) + (2 * 5 + 11) = 86 candies. \n**8. Conclusion:**\nWe have found a solution that satisfies the problem's conditions. While we can't be certain it's the absolute maximum,  86 candies is a valid maximum number of candies in Sally's bag. \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Problem**\nSally has a certain number of candies. We know she can arrange them in an *a* by *b* grid with some leftover. Rita can arrange the same candies in a different grid with *no* leftover.  Our goal is to find the maximum number of candies Sally could have.\n**2. Set up Equations**\n* **Sally's arrangement:** The total number of candies Sally has is represented by the area of her grid plus the leftover:  *ab + 2a + b*\n* **Rita's arrangement:** The total number of candies is also represented by the area of Rita's grid: *(5a-4)(b-1)/3*\n**3. Equate the Expressions**\nSince both arrangements represent the same number of candies, we can set the two expressions equal to each other:\n*ab + 2a + b = (5a-4)(b-1)/3*\n**4. Simplify and Solve**\nLet's simplify and solve for one of the variables. To make things easier, let's multiply both sides of the equation by 3:\n*3ab + 6a + 3b = (5a-4)(b-1)*\nExpand the right side:\n*3ab + 6a + 3b = 5ab - 5a - 4b + 4*\nCombine like terms:\n*2ab - 11a - 7b = 4*\nNow, we have a quadratic equation in two variables. To find the maximum number of candies, we need to find the maximum value of *ab + 2a + b*.  This is a bit tricky, but we can use some reasoning:\n* **Factors of 4:**  The right side of the equation (4) has factors 1, 2, and 4.  We'll try to see if these factors can help us find values for *a* and *b* that satisfy the equation.\n* **Trial and Error:** Let's try substituting different values for *a* and *b* that might give us a factor of 4 on the left side. \n    * If we try *a = 2* and *b = 1*, the left side becomes 0, not 4. \n    * If we try *a = 1* and *b = 2*, the left side becomes -15, not 4.\nSince we're looking for the maximum number of candies, we want the largest possible values for *a* and *b*. Let's try to find a combination where the left side becomes 4:\n* If we try *a = 1* and *b = 3*, the left side becomes 4, satisfying the equation. \n**5. Maximum Number of Candies**\nWith *a = 1* and *b = 3*, we can find the maximum number of candies using either Sally's or Rita's arrangement:\n* **Sally's:** (1 * 3) + (2 * 1) + 3 = 8\n* **Rita's:** (5 * 1 - 4) (3 - 1) / 3 = 2/3 * 2 = 4/3 (This doesn't make sense, so we know Sally's arrangement gives the maximum.)\n**Answer:** The maximum number of candies Sally could have is **8**. \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Information**\n* **Sally's arrangement:** Sally arranges her candies in an *a* by *b* grid, with *2a + b* candies leftover. This means the total number of candies Sally has is *ab + 2a + b*.\n* **Rita's arrangement:** Rita arranges the candies in a *5a - 4* by *(b - 1)/3* grid with no leftovers. This means the total number of candies is (5a - 4)(b - 1)/3.\n**2. Set up an Equation**\nSince both arrangements represent the same number of candies, we can set up an equation:\n*ab + 2a + b = (5a - 4)(b - 1)/3*\n**3. Simplify the Equation**\nLet's simplify the equation to make it easier to work with:\n*3ab + 6a + 3b = 5ab - 5a - 4b + 4*\n*2ab - 11a - 7b = -4*\n**4. Factor the Equation**\nTo find the maximum number of candies, we need to find the maximum values for *a* and *b*. We can factor the equation to help with this:\n*a(2b - 11) - 7b = -4*\n**5.  Find Values for a and b**\nWe need to find values for *a* and *b* that satisfy the equation.  Since we're looking for the maximum number of candies, let's focus on maximizing *a* and *b*.  \n* Notice that the term *2b - 11* must be positive (or at least not negative) for the equation to work. This means *b* must be at least 6.\n* If we try *b = 6*, we get *2b - 11 = 1*, which means *a* must be a multiple of 7 (to satisfy the equation). \n* Let's try *a = 7*. This gives us *2ab - 11a - 7b = -4*, which is true!\n**6. Calculate the Maximum Number of Candies**\nNow that we have values for *a* and *b* that work, we can calculate the maximum number of candies:\n*ab + 2a + b = (7)(6) + 2(7) + 6 = 42 + 14 + 6 = **62** \n**Therefore, the maximum number of candies in Sally's bag is 62.** \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n* Sally has a certain number of candies.\n* She tries to arrange them in a rectangular grid, but has leftovers.\n* Rita arranges the same candies in a different rectangular grid, with no leftovers.\n* We need to find the maximum number of candies Sally could have.\n**2. Set Up Equations**\n* Let  'C' be the total number of candies Sally has. \n*  Sally's grid: C = (a * b) + (2a + b) \n* Rita's grid: C = (5a - 4) * ((b - 1)/3) \n**3. Simplify and Solve**\n* We have two expressions for 'C'. Let's set them equal to each other:\n   (a * b) + (2a + b) = (5a - 4) * ((b - 1)/3)\n* Now, we need to manipulate this equation to find a solution that gives us the maximum value of 'C'. It's a bit tricky to solve for 'a' and 'b' directly, so we'll try to find some useful relationships. \n* **Focus on factors:** Notice that in Rita's grid, (b-1) must be divisible by 3. This means 'b' could be 1, 4, 7, 10... \n* **Test values:** Let's try some values of 'b' and see if we can find suitable values for 'a' that satisfy the equation:\n    * **If b = 4:** \n        * Sally's grid: C = 4a + 2a + 4 = 6a + 4\n        * Rita's grid: C = (5a - 4) * 1 = 5a - 4\n        * Setting them equal: 6a + 4 = 5a - 4 \n        * This gives us a = -8, which doesn't make sense (we can't have negative candies).\n    * **If b = 7:**\n        * Sally's grid: C = 7a + 2a + 7 = 9a + 7\n        * Rita's grid: C = (5a - 4) * 2 = 10a - 8\n        * Setting them equal: 9a + 7 = 10a - 8\n        * This gives us a = 15.  This works!\n**4. Calculate the Maximum Number of Candies**\n* Using the values a = 15 and b = 7, we can find the maximum number of candies:\n* Sally's grid: C = (15 * 7) + (2 * 15 + 7) = 105 + 37 = 142\n**Therefore, the maximum number of candies in Sally's bag is 142.** \n"
