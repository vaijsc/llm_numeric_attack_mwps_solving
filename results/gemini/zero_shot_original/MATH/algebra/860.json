        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Simplify the equation:**\n* Start by combining the terms on the left side of the equation:\n   \n   ```\n   (c^2 + 6c - 27)/(c-3) + 2c = 23 \n   ```\n* To combine the terms, we need a common denominator:\n   ```\n   (c^2 + 6c - 27)/(c-3) + 2c * (c-3)/(c-3) = 23\n   ```\n* Now we can combine the numerators:\n   ```\n   (c^2 + 6c - 27 + 2c^2 - 6c)/(c-3) = 23\n   ```\n* Simplify the numerator:\n   ```\n   (3c^2 - 27)/(c-3) = 23\n   ```\n**2. Solve for c:**\n* Multiply both sides by (c-3) to get rid of the denominator:\n   ```\n   3c^2 - 27 = 23(c-3)\n   ```\n* Expand the right side:\n   ```\n   3c^2 - 27 = 23c - 69\n   ```\n* Move all terms to one side:\n   ```\n   3c^2 - 23c + 42 = 0\n   ```\n* Factor the quadratic equation:\n   ```\n   (3c - 14)(c - 3) = 0\n   ```\n* Solve for c:\n   ```\n   3c - 14 = 0  or  c - 3 = 0\n   ```\n   This gives us two possible solutions:\n   ```\n   c = 14/3  or  c = 3\n   ```\n**3. Check for extraneous solutions:**\n* Notice that if  c = 3, the original equation has a denominator of 0, which is undefined. Therefore, c = 3 is an extraneous solution.\n**4. The largest value of c:**\n* The only valid solution is c = 14/3.\n**Answer:** The largest value of c that satisfies the equation is **c = 14/3**. \n",
        "1. **Simplify the equation:** \n   * Combine the terms on the left side of the equation. To do this, we need a common denominator:\n   \n   ```\n   (c^2 + 6c - 27)/(c-3) + 2c = 23\n   (c^2 + 6c - 27)/(c-3) + 2c(c-3)/(c-3) = 23\n   (c^2 + 6c - 27 + 2c^2 - 6c) / (c-3) = 23 \n   (3c^2 - 27) / (c-3) = 23\n   ```\n2. **Multiply both sides by (c-3):**\n   ```\n   3c^2 - 27 = 23(c-3)\n   ```\n3. **Expand and simplify:**\n   ```\n   3c^2 - 27 = 23c - 69\n   3c^2 - 23c + 42 = 0\n   ```\n4. **Solve the quadratic equation:**  We can factor the quadratic:\n   ```\n   (3c - 14)(c - 3) = 0\n   ```\n   This gives us two possible solutions: \n   *  c = 14/3\n   *  c = 3\n5. **Check for extraneous solutions:** We need to make sure that our solutions don't make the denominator of the original equation equal to zero. The original denominator was (c-3), so c = 3 is an extraneous solution.\n6. **The answer:** The largest value of c that satisfies the equation is **c = 14/3**. \n",
        "1. **Simplify the equation:** First, we need to get rid of the fraction. To do that, we multiply both sides of the equation by $(c-3)$: \n   (c\u00b2 + 6c - 27) + 2c(c-3) = 23(c-3)\n2. **Expand and simplify:** Expand the products on both sides of the equation:\n   c\u00b2 + 6c - 27 + 2c\u00b2 - 6c = 23c - 69\n3. **Combine like terms:** Combine the terms on the left side of the equation:\n   3c\u00b2 - 27 = 23c - 69\n4. **Move all terms to one side:** Subtract 23c and add 69 to both sides:\n   3c\u00b2 - 23c + 42 = 0\n5. **Factor the quadratic:** Factor the quadratic equation:\n   (3c - 14)(c - 3) = 0\n6. **Solve for c:** Set each factor equal to zero and solve for c:\n   3c - 14 = 0  or  c - 3 = 0\n   c = 14/3  or  c = 3\n7. **Check for extraneous solutions:** Notice that if c = 3, the original equation has a denominator of zero, which is undefined. Therefore, c = 3 is an extraneous solution.\n8. **The largest value:** The only valid solution is c = 14/3.\nTherefore, the largest value of c that satisfies the equation is **c = 14/3**. \n",
