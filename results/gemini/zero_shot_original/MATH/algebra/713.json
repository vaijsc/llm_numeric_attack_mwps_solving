    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let $a$ be the middle integer, so the integers are $a-1$, $a$, and $a+1$. The sum of the the three integers is $(a-1) + a + (a+1) = 3a$, so $3a = 27$, or $a=9$. So the integers are 8, 9, and 10. Their product is $\\boxed{720}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Define the variables:**\n* Let 'x' represent the first integer.\n* The next consecutive integer is 'x + 1'.\n* The third consecutive integer is 'x + 2'.\n**2. Set up the equation:**\nThe sum of the three consecutive integers is 27, so:\nx + (x + 1) + (x + 2) = 27\n**3. Solve for x:**\n* Combine like terms: 3x + 3 = 27\n* Subtract 3 from both sides: 3x = 24\n* Divide both sides by 3: x = 8\n**4. Find the three integers:**\n* The first integer (x) is 8.\n* The second integer (x + 1) is 9.\n* The third integer (x + 2) is 10.\n**5. Calculate the product:**\nThe product of the three integers is 8 * 9 * 10 = **720** \n",
