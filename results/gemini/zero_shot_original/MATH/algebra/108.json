        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Ratio:**\n* The ratio of  *x* to *y* is 1:2 means that for every 1 unit of *x*, there are 2 units of *y*. We can write this as the equation: \n   *x/y = 1/2*\n**2.  Solve for x:**\n* We are given that *y = 4x - 36*.  Let's substitute this into our ratio equation:\n   *x/(4x - 36) = 1/2*\n**3. Cross-Multiply:**\n* To solve for *x*, cross-multiply:\n   *2x = 4x - 36*\n**4. Isolate x:**\n* Subtract *2x* from both sides:\n   *0 = 2x - 36*\n* Add *36* to both sides:\n   *36 = 2x*\n* Divide both sides by 2:\n   *x = 18*\n**Therefore, the value of x is 18.** \n",

Set up an Equation:**\nSince the ratio is 1:2, we can write: \n*  *y* = 2*x* \n**3. Substitute the Value of y:**\nWe are given that *y* = 4*x* - 36.  Substitute this into the equation we just created:\n*  4*x* - 36 = 2*x*\n**4. Solve for x:**\n*  2*x* = 36 \n*  x = 18\n**Therefore, the value of x is 18.** \n",
