    "solution": "The common ratio between consecutive terms is $\\frac{3}{5}$ (you can choose any two consecutive terms and divide the second one by the first to find the common ratio). So the $n^\\text{th}$ term of the sequence is $\\frac{125}{9} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{3}{5} \\right)^{n-1}$. Plugging in $n=8$, we get $$\n\\frac{125}{9} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{3}{5} \\right)^{7} = \\frac{5^3}{3^2} \\cdot \\frac{3^7}{5^7}\n= \\frac{3^5}{5^4}\n= \\boxed{\\frac{243}{625}}.\n$$",

        "1. **Find the common ratio:** Divide any term by the term before it. For example,  (25/3) / (125/9) = (25/3) * (9/125) = 3/5.  So the common ratio is 3/5.\n2. **Find the general formula:**  The general formula for a geometric sequence is  a_n = a_1 * r^(n-1), where a_n is the nth term, a_1 is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the term number.\n3. **Apply the formula:** In this case, a_1 = 125/9 and r = 3/5.  We want to find the 8th term, so n = 8.\n4. **Calculate the eighth term:**  a_8 = (125/9) * (3/5)^(8-1) = (125/9) * (3/5)^7 = (125/9) * (2187/78125) = **243/625**. \n",
