    "solution": "Since $f(g(x)) = g(x)^3 - 6g(x)^2 + 3g(x) - 4$, it suffices to identify the constant terms of $g(x)^3$, $g(x)^2$, and $g(x)$. When expanding $g(x)^3$, we notice that the only way to obtain the constant term is to multiply the constant term with $g(x)$ by itself multiple (3) times: $(-2) \\times (-2) \\times (-2) = -8$. Similarly, the constant term of $g(x)^2$ is $(-2) \\times (-2) = 4$. The constant term in $g(x)$ is $-2$. Substituting gives $(-8) - 6 \\cdot 4 + 3 \\cdot (-2) - 4 = -8 - 24 - 6 - 4 = \\boxed{-42}$.",

Focus on the Constant Term:**\n*  To find the constant term, we only need to consider the terms that don't have any 'x' variables. \n*  The only terms contributing to the constant term come from:\n    * (-2)^3 = -8 (from the first term)\n    * -6(-2)^2 = -24 (from the second term)\n    * 3(-2) = -6 (from the third term)\n    * -4 (the last term)\n**4.
