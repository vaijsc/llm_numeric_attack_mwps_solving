        "Here's how to find the sum of the complex numbers:\n**1. Understand Complex Numbers**\n* Complex numbers have a real part and an imaginary part.\n* The imaginary part is denoted by the letter 'i', where i\u00b2 = -1.\n* Example:  508 + 1749i has a real part of 508 and an imaginary part of 1749.\n**2. Add the Real Parts**\n* Add the real parts of Kelly's and Avril's numbers: 508 + (-1322) = -814\n**3. Add the Imaginary Parts**\n* Add the imaginary parts of Kelly's and Avril's numbers: 1749 + 1949 = 3698\n**4. Combine the Results**\n* The sum of the complex numbers is -814 + 3698i\n**Therefore, the sum of Kelly's and Avril's numbers is -814 + 3698i.** \n",
        "Here's how to find the sum of the complex numbers:\n**1. Understand Complex Numbers**\nComplex numbers are written in the form *a + bi*, where *a* and *b* are real numbers, and *i* is the imaginary unit (where *i*\u00b2 = -1).\n**2. Add Real and Imaginary Parts Separately**\nTo add complex numbers, we add the real parts and the imaginary parts separately:\n* **Real parts:** 508 + (-1322) = -814\n* **Imaginary parts:** 1749 + 1949 = 3698\n**3.
