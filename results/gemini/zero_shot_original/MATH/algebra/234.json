    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let the two sides of the rectangle be $a$ and $b$.  The problem is now telling us $ab=6a+6b$.  Putting everything on one side of the equation, we have, $ab - 6a - 6b =0$.  This looks tricky.  However, we can add a number to both sides of the equation to make it factor nicely.  36 works here:  $$ab - 6a - 6b + 36 = 36 \\implies (a-6)(b-6)=36$$Since we don't have a square, $a$ and $b$ must be different.  Thus, the possible factor pairs of $36$ are $(1,36),(2,18),(3,12),(4,9)$.  As we can quickly see, $4 + 9 = 13$ is the smallest sum for any of those pairs, so $a = 10, b = 15$, with a total perimeter of $\\boxed{50}$, is the smallest possible perimeter.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Set up the equations:**\n* Let the length of the rectangle be 'l' units.\n* Let the width of the rectangle be 'w' units.\nWe are given that the area is triple the perimeter:\n* **Area:**  l * w \n* **Perimeter:** 2l + 2w \nTherefore, the equation is:  l * w = 3(2l + 2w)\n**2. Simplify the equation:**\n* l * w = 6l + 6w\n* l * w - 6l - 6w = 0\n**3. Solve for one variable:**\nTo make the equation easier to work with, let's solve for 'l' in terms of 'w':\n* l * w - 6l = 6w\n* l(w - 6) = 6w\n* l = (6w) / (w - 6)\n**4. Find the smallest possible perimeter:**\nWe want to find the smallest possible perimeter, which is 2l + 2w.  To minimize the perimeter, we need to minimize the values of 'l' and 'w'.\n* **Consider the denominator (w - 6):**  The denominator must be positive for 'l' to be positive.  The smallest possible integer value for 'w' that makes the denominator positive is w = 7.\n* **Calculate 'l':**  When w = 7,  l = (6 * 7) / (7 - 6) = 42.\n* **Calculate the perimeter:**  The perimeter is 2 * 42 + 2 * 7 = 84 + 14 = 98\n**5. Check if the solution works:**\n* **Area:** 42 * 7 = 294\n* **Perimeter:** 2 * 42 + 2 * 7 = 98\n* **Area is triple the perimeter:** 294 = 3 * 98 \n**Therefore, the smallest possible length for the perimeter is 98 units.** \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Set up the equations:**\n* Let the length of the rectangle be 'l' and the width be 'w'.\n* Area = l * w\n* Perimeter = 2l + 2w\n* We are given that Area = 3 * Perimeter\n**2. Substitute and simplify:**\n* l * w = 3 * (2l + 2w)\n* l * w = 6l + 6w\n**3. Rearrange the equation:**\n* l * w - 6l - 6w = 0 \n**4.  Complete the square (or use factoring):**\n* To complete the square, we need to add a constant to both sides.  The constant we need is found by taking half of the coefficients of 'l' and 'w', squaring them, and adding them to both sides:\n    *  (-6/2)^2 = 9  (for 'l')\n    *  (-6/2)^2 = 9 (for 'w')\n* Add 9l + 9w to both sides of the equation:\n    * l * w - 6l - 6w + 9l + 9w = 9l + 9w\n* Now we can factor the left side:\n    * (l - 6)(w - 6) = 9l + 9w\n**5. Find possible factors:**\n* Since we are looking for the smallest perimeter, we need to find the smallest possible values for 'l' and 'w' that satisfy the equation.  \n* The factors of 9 are 1, 3, and 9.  We need to find combinations of these factors that, when added to 6, will give us possible values for 'l' and 'w'.\n**6. Test the possibilities:**\n* If (l - 6) = 1 and (w - 6) = 9, then l = 7 and w = 15. This works!\n* If (l - 6) = 3 and (w - 6) = 3, then l = 9 and w = 9.  This doesn't work because the rectangle must not be a square.\n**7. Calculate the perimeter:**\n* The smallest possible perimeter is 2l + 2w = 2(7) + 2(15) = **44 units**. \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem:\n**1. Set up equations:**\n* Let the length of the rectangle be 'l' and the width be 'w'.\n* Area:  l * w\n* Perimeter: 2l + 2w\n* We are given: Area = 3 * Perimeter \n**2. Translate the given information into an equation:**\nl * w = 3 * (2l + 2w)\n**3. Simplify the equation:**\nlw = 6l + 6w\n**4.

Solve for possible values of l and w:**\n* l - 6 = 0  =>  l = 6\n* w - 6 = 0  =>  w = 6\nThis solution (l = 6, w = 6) represents a square, not a rectangle.  Since we need a non-square rectangle, we need to look for other solutions.\n**7. Think about the equation:**\nThe equation (l - 6)(w - 6) = 0 tells us that either (l - 6) = 0 or (w - 6) = 0. This means that one of the dimensions must be 6, while the other can be any integer greater than 6.\n**8. Find the smallest possible perimeter:**\nTo minimize the perimeter, we want the difference between the length and width to be as small as possible.  Therefore, let's choose l = 7 and w = 6.\n**9. Calculate the perimeter:**\nPerimeter = 2l + 2w = 2(7) + 2(6) = 26\n**Answer:** The smallest possible length for the perimeter is **26 units**. \n",

Determine the smallest possible perimeter:**\nWe need to find the factors of 36 that will result in the smallest possible perimeter (2l + 2w).  To minimize the perimeter, we want the length and width to be as close together as possible. \n* **l = 12 and w = 9**  would give us the smallest possible perimeter.\n**7.

This can be tricky, so let's look for patterns.  Notice that if we add '36' to both sides, we can complete the square:\n   l * w - 6(l + w) + 36 = 36\n* Now, we can factor the left side:\n   (l - 6)(w - 6) = 36\n**5.
