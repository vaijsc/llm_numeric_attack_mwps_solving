    "problem": "Raymond normally has a snack consisting of ten 12-calorie crackers. How many 20-calorie cookies would he have to eat to consume the same number of calories?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Raymond consumes a total of $10\\cdot12=120$ calories at snack. If he eats $c$ cookies, he would get $20c$ calories, so since he needs this to equal 120, he must eat $c=120/20=\\boxed{6}$ cookies.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Calculate the total calories in Raymond's crackers:**\n* He eats 10 crackers.\n* Each cracker has 12 calories.\n* Total calories: 10 crackers * 12 calories/cracker = 120 calories\n**2. Determine how many cookies equal the same calories:**\n* Each cookie has 20 calories.\n* Divide the total calories (120) by the calories per cookie (20): 120 calories / 20 calories/cookie = 6 cookies\n**Answer:** Raymond would need to eat 6 cookies to consume the same number of calories as his usual snack of crackers. \n",
