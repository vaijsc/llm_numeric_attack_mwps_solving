        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Set up the equations:**\n* Let the two positive numbers be  *x* and *y*.\n* We are given: \n    *  *x* * y* = 24 \n    *  *x*\u00b2 + *y*\u00b2 = 73\n**2. Use the algebraic identity:**\n* We know that (x - y)\u00b2 = x\u00b2 - 2xy + y\u00b2\n**3. Substitute and simplify:**\n* We can rewrite the equation for the sum of squares as: \n    * x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 73 \n    *  x\u00b2 - 2xy + y\u00b2 + 2xy = 73 \n* Substitute *xy* = 24 into the equation:\n    *  (x - y)\u00b2 + 2 * 24 = 73\n    * (x - y)\u00b2 = 73 - 48\n    * (x - y)\u00b2 = 25\n**4. The answer:**\n* The square of the difference of the two numbers is **25**. \n",

Manipulate the equations:**\n* We want to find (*x* - *y*)\u00b2.  Notice that this is a difference of squares, which can be expanded as: \n    * (*x* - *y*)\u00b2 = *x*\u00b2 - 2*x*y + *y*\u00b2\n* We already have *x*\u00b2 + *y*\u00b2, but we need -2*x*y. We can get this by multiplying the first equation by -2:\n    * -2(*x* * y*) = -48\n**3. Combine the equations:**\n* Add the equation *x*\u00b2 + *y*\u00b2 = 73 and -2(*x* * y*) = -48:\n    * *x*\u00b2 + *y*\u00b2 - 2*x*y = 73 - 48\n    * *x*\u00b2 - 2*x*y + *y*\u00b2 = 25\n**4.
