        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n1. **Recognize the pattern:** Notice that both $\\frac{81}{256}$ and $\\frac{3}{4}$ can be expressed as powers of the same base. \n2. **Express both sides as powers of the same base:**\n   *  $\\frac{81}{256} = \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^4$ \n   *  $\\frac{3}{4} = \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^1$\n3. **Substitute and solve for x:** Now we have:\n   *  $\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^x = \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^4$\n   *  Since the bases are the same, the exponents must be equal. Therefore,  **x = 4**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n1. **Express both sides with the same base:**  Notice that both 81 and 256 are powers of 4:\n   *  81 = 3\u2074\n   *  256 = 4\u2074\n   Substitute these values into the equation:\n   \n   (3/4)\u02e3 = (3\u2074)/(4\u2074)\n2. **Simplify using exponent rules:**  Recall that (a/b)\u207f = a\u207f/b\u207f.  Therefore:\n   (3/4)\u02e3 = (3/4)\u2074\n3. **Equate exponents:** Since the bases are the same, we can equate the exponents:\n   x = 4\n**Therefore, x must be 4.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Express both sides with the same base:**\n* Notice that 81 is 3 to the power of 4 (3 x 3 x 3 x 3 = 81)\n* Also, 256 is 4 to the power of 4 (4 x 4 x 4 x 4 = 256)\n* So we can rewrite the equation as:  \n  (3/4)^x = (3^4) / (4^4)\n**2. Simplify using exponent rules:**\n*  (3/4)^x = (3/4)^4 \n**3. Solve for x:**\n* Since the bases are now the same, the exponents must be equal.\n* Therefore, x = 4\n**Answer:** x must be 4. \n",
