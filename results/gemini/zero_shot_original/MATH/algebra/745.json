        "**1. Express 1/625 as a power of 5:**\nSince 625 is 5 raised to the power of 4 (5 x 5 x 5 x 5 = 625), we have: \n1/625 = 5\u207b\u2074 \n**2. Substitute into the logarithm:**\nNow we can rewrite the problem:\nlog\u2085 (1/625) = log\u2085 (5\u207b\u2074)\n**3. Apply the property of logarithms:**\nThe property of logarithms states that log\u2090 (b\u207f) = n * log\u2090 (b).  Applying this to our problem:\nlog\u2085 (5\u207b\u2074) = -4 * log\u2085 (5)\n**4. Evaluate log\u2085 (5):**\nRemember that log\u2090 (a) = 1. Therefore:\nlog\u2085 (5) = 1\n**5. Final Calculation:**\nSubstitute back into the expression:\n-4 * log\u2085 (5) = -4 * 1 = **-4**\n**Therefore, log\u2085 (1/625) = -4** \n",

        "Let's break down how to evaluate $\\log_5\\frac{1}{625}$:\n**Understanding Logarithms**\n* **Logarithm Definition:** The logarithm of a number (the argument) to a given base is the exponent to which the base must be raised to produce that number. In simpler terms:  \n   *  If  $b^x = y$, then $\\log_b y = x$ \n**Applying the Definition**\n1. **Rewrite the argument as a power of the base:** \n   *  Notice that 625 is 5 raised to the power of 4:  $625 = 5^4$\n   *  Therefore, $\\frac{1}{625} = 5^{-4}$\n2. **Apply the logarithm definition:**\n   * We're looking for the exponent to which 5 must be raised to get  $\\frac{1}{625}$. \n   * Since we already know  $\\frac{1}{625} = 5^{-4}$, the answer is **-4**.\n**Therefore,  $\\log_5\\frac{1}{625} = -4$** \n",
