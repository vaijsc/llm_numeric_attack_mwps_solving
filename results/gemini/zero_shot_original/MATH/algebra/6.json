        "Here's how to solve the inequality step-by-step:\n1. **Move all terms to one side:** \n   Subtract 10 from both sides to get:\n   \n   ```\n   x^2 - 5x - 14 <= 0 \n   ```\n2. **Factor the quadratic:**\n   Factor the left side of the inequality:\n   \n   ```\n   (x - 7)(x + 2) <= 0\n   ```\n3. **Find the critical points:**\n   The critical points are the values of *x* that make the expression equal to zero.  Set each factor equal to zero and solve:\n   *  x - 7 = 0  =>  x = 7\n   *  x + 2 = 0  =>  x = -2\n4. **Test intervals:**\n   The critical points divide the number line into three intervals:\n   *  x < -2\n   *  -2 < x < 7\n   *  x > 7\n   We need to test a value from each interval to see if it satisfies the inequality:\n   * **x < -2:**  Let's try x = -3.  (-3 - 7)(-3 + 2) = 10 > 0.  This interval does *not* satisfy the inequality.\n   * **-2 < x < 7:** Let's try x = 0. (0 - 7)(0 + 2) = -14 < 0.

        "1. **Move all terms to one side:**  Subtract 10 from both sides to get a quadratic inequality: \n   \n   $x^2 - 5x - 14 \\le 0$\n2. **Factor the quadratic:** Find two numbers that multiply to -14 and add up to -5. These numbers are -7 and 2. So, we can factor the inequality:\n   $(x-7)(x+2) \\le 0$\n3. **Find the critical points:** The critical points are the values of *x* where the expression equals zero.  Set each factor equal to zero and solve:\n   *  x - 7 = 0  =>  x = 7\n   *  x + 2 = 0  =>  x = -2\n4. **Test intervals:** The critical points divide the number line into three intervals:\n   *  x < -2\n   *  -2 < x < 7\n   *  x > 7\n   Choose a test value within each interval and plug it into the factored inequality to see if it makes the inequality true:\n   *  **x < -2:**  Let's try x = -3.

        "1. **Set up the inequality:**  We want to find the values of $x$ for which $x^2 - 5x - 4 \\le 10$.  To solve this, we need to bring all the terms to one side:\n   \n   $x^2 - 5x - 4 - 10 \\le 0$\n   $x^2 - 5x - 14 \\le 0$\n2. **Factor the quadratic:** Factor the quadratic expression on the left-hand side:\n   $(x - 7)(x + 2) \\le 0$\n3. **Find the critical points:** The critical points are the values of $x$ that make the expression equal to zero.  These are $x = 7$ and $x = -2$.\n4. **Test intervals:** The critical points divide the number line into three intervals:\n   * $x < -2$\n   * $-2 < x < 7$\n   * $x > 7$\n   We need to test a value within each interval to see if the inequality holds true.\n   * **Interval 1 (x < -2):** Let's try $x = -3$.  Plugging into the factored inequality:\n      $(-3 - 7)(-3 + 2) = (-10)(-1) = 10 > 0$. The inequality does not hold true in this interval.\n   * **Interval 2 (-2 < x < 7):** Let's try $x = 0$. Plugging into the factored inequality:\n      $(0 - 7)(0 + 2) = (-7)(2) = -14 < 0$. The inequality holds true in this interval.\n   * **Interval 3 (x > 7):** Let's try $x = 8$. Plugging into the factored inequality:\n      $(8 - 7)(8 + 2) = (1)(10) = 10 > 0$. The inequality does not hold true in this interval.\n5. **Solution:**  The inequality holds true for the interval $-2 \\le x \\le 7$.\n**Therefore, the solution in interval notation is $[-2, 7]$.** \n",
