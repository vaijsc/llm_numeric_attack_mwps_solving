        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding the Pattern**\nThe expression represents a repeating pattern of square roots. Notice that the entire expression is equal to the square root of itself plus an 'x'. This means we can set up an equation:\n\u221a(x + \u221a(x + \u221a(x + ...))) = \u221a(x +  \u221a(x + \u221a(x + ...)))\n**Solving for x**\n1. **Let y represent the repeating expression:**\n   Let  y = \u221a(x + \u221a(x + \u221a(x + ...))) \n2. **Substitute y into the equation:**\n   y = \u221a(x + y)\n3. **Square both sides:**\n   y\u00b2 = x + y\n4. **Rearrange into a quadratic equation:**\n   y\u00b2 - y - x = 0\n5. **Use the quadratic formula:**\n   y = (1 \u00b1 \u221a(1 + 4x)) / 2\n6. **Since the original expression is positive, we choose the positive root:**\n   y = (1 + \u221a(1 + 4x)) / 2\n7. **Substitute y back to the original equation:**\n   (1 + \u221a(1 + 4x)) / 2 = 9\n8. **Solve for x:**\n   * Multiply both sides by 2:  1 + \u221a(1 + 4x) = 18\n   * Subtract 1 from both sides:  \u221a(1 + 4x) = 17\n   * Square both sides: 1 + 4x = 289\n   * Subtract 1 from both sides: 4x = 288\n   * Divide both sides by 4: x = 72\n**Therefore, x = 72** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understanding the Pattern**\nThe expression inside the square root repeats infinitely. This is a classic example of a nested radical.
