    "problem": "When Frederick was born, his grandparents gave him a gift of $\\$2000$, which was invested at a simple interest rate of $5\\%$ per year.  How much money will Frederick have when he can collect the money at the age of $18$?  (Assume no money is added to the account besides the interest.)",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "If the interest is simple, then Frederick's money grows by $\\allowbreak .05(2000)=100$ dollars per year.  This means he gained $18\\times100=\\$1800$, so he has a total of $2000+1800=\\boxed{\\$3800}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Calculate the annual interest:**\n* Interest rate = 5% = 0.05 (as a decimal)\n* Annual interest = Principal amount * Interest rate \n* Annual interest = $2000 * 0.05 = $100\n**2. Calculate the total interest earned:**\n* Number of years = 18 years\n* Total interest = Annual interest * Number of years\n* Total interest = $100 * 18 = $1800\n**3. Calculate the total amount Frederick will have:**\n* Total amount = Principal amount + Total interest\n* Total amount = $2000 + $1800 = $3800\n**Answer:** Frederick will have $3800 when he turns 18. \n",
