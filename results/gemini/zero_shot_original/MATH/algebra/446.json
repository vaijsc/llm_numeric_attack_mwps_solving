Find the Conditions for a Zero Denominator**\nWe want to find values of *c* that make the quadratic equation  $x^2 - x + c = 0$ have no real solutions.  \n**3. Use the Discriminant**\nThe discriminant of a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is given by:  $b^2 - 4ac$.\n* If the discriminant is positive, the quadratic has two distinct real roots.\n* If the discriminant is zero, the quadratic has one real root (a double root).\n* If the discriminant is negative, the quadratic has no real roots.\n**4.
