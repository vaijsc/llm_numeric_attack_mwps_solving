    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We first combine the two fractions with $x$ in the denominator to give $\\frac{3}{x} - \\frac{3}{5} = \\frac{1}{5}$.  Adding $\\frac{3}{5}$ to both sides gives us $\\frac{3}{x} = \\frac{4}{5}$.  Cross-multiplying this equation (or multiplying both sides by $5x$) gives $4x = 15$.  Dividing both sides of this equation by $4$ gives us $x =\\boxed{\\frac{15}{4}}$.",
