        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**Understanding the Pattern**\nThe sequence follows this pattern:\n* **Add:** Add the next integer to the previous term.\n* **Multiply:** Multiply the result by the next integer.\n**Finding the Pattern's Behavior**\nNotice that multiplying by an integer significantly increases the value of the term.  Let's look at a few terms:\n* **Term 1:** 0\n* **Term 2:** 0 + 1 = 1\n* **Term 3:** 1 * 1 = 1\n* **Term 4:** 1 + 2 = 3\n* **Term 5:** 3 * 2 = 6\n* **Term 6:** 6 + 3 = 9\n* **Term 7:** 9 * 3 = 27\n**Finding the Term Greater than 125**\nSince we're looking for a term greater than 125, let's see how the sequence grows:\n* **Term 7:** 27 \n* **Term 8:** 27 + 4 = 31\n* **Term 9:** 31 * 4 = 124\n* **Term 10:** 124 + 5 = 129 \n**Answer**\nThe first term greater than 125 is **Term 10**, which has a value of **129**. \n",
        "Let's break down the sequence and find the first term greater than 125:\n**Understanding the Pattern:**\n* **Step 1:** Add the current integer to the previous term.\n* **Step 2:** Multiply the result by the current integer.\n**Continuing the Sequence:**\n* **7th term:** 27 * 7 = 189 \n* **8th term:** 189 + 8 = 197\n* **9th term:** 197 * 9 = 1773 \n**The answer:** The first term greater than 125 is **189**. \n",

        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Pattern:**\n* The sequence alternates between adding and multiplying by consecutive integers.\n* **Adding:** 0 + 1 = 1, 1 + 2 = 3, 6 + 3 = 9\n* **Multiplying:** 1 * 1 = 1, 3 * 2 = 6, 9 * 3 = 27\n**2. Continue the Sequence:**\nLet's continue the sequence to find the first term greater than 125:\n* 27 * 4 = 108\n* 108 + 5 = 113\n* 113 * 6 = 678 \n**3. The Answer:**\nThe first term greater than 125 is **678**. \n",
