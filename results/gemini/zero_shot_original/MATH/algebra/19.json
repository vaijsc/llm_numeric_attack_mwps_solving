    "problem": "In a 8 fluid ounce bottle of Vitamin Water, there are 125 calories. How many calories would be contained in a 12 fluid ounce bottle? Express your answer in decimal form.",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We know that there are 125 calories in 8 fluid ounces of Vitamin Water, so we can set up the proportion $\\frac{125}{8}=\\frac{x}{12}$, where $x$ is the number of calories contained in a 12 fluid ounce bottle. Solving for $x$, we find that $x=\\left(\\frac{125}{8}\\right)(12)=\\boxed{187.5}$ calories.",

        "Here's how to solve this:\n**1. Find the calories per ounce:**\n* Divide the calories in the 8-ounce bottle by the number of ounces: 125 calories / 8 ounces = 15.625 calories per ounce\n**2. Calculate the calories in the 12-ounce bottle:**\n* Multiply the calories per ounce by the number of ounces in the larger bottle: 15.625 calories/ounce * 12 ounces = 187.5 calories\n**Answer:** A 12 fluid ounce bottle of Vitamin Water would contain **187.5** calories. \n",
