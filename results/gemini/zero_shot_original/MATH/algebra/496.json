    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "In order for $f(x)$ to have a real number value, the expression inside the square root in the numerator must be non-negative and the denominator must not be 0. So we have the two conditions $x-1\\ge0 \\Rightarrow x \\ge 1$ and $x-2 \\ne 0 \\Rightarrow x \\ne 2$. We see that $x=\\boxed{1}$ is the smallest integer value that satisfies both conditions.",
