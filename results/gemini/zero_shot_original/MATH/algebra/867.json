        "Here's how we can solve this problem:\n**1. Visualize the Situation**\nImagine the two circles of radius 1 centered at (4,0) and (-4,0).  The point (0,5) lies above these circles.  We want to find circles that are tangent to both of the given circles and also pass through (0,5).\n**2.  Key Observations**\n* **Symmetry:** Due to symmetry, any circle tangent to both given circles and passing through (0,5) must have its center on the y-axis. \n* **Radius:** The radius of a circle tangent to both given circles must be 1 unit greater than the distance from the center of the tangent circle to the center of one of the given circles.\n**3.  Finding the Center**\nLet the center of the desired circle be (0,y).  Let's consider the distance from (0,y) to the center of the circle at (4,0):\n* This distance is  \u221a((0-4)\u00b2 + (y-0)\u00b2) = \u221a(16 + y\u00b2) \nSince the radius of the desired circle is 1 unit greater than this distance, we have:\n* Radius of desired circle = \u221a(16 + y\u00b2) + 1\n**4.  Using the Point (0,5)**\nThe distance from the center of the desired circle (0,y) to the point (0,5) must also equal the radius:\n* \u221a((0-0)\u00b2 + (y-5)\u00b2) = \u221a(16 + y\u00b2) + 1 \n* \u221a(y\u00b2 - 10y + 25) = \u221a(16 + y\u00b2) + 1\n**5. Solving for y**\n* Square both sides: y\u00b2 - 10y + 25 = 16 + y\u00b2 + 2\u221a(16 + y\u00b2) + 1\n* Simplify:  -10y + 8 = 2\u221a(16 + y\u00b2) \n* Square both sides again: 100y\u00b2 - 160y + 64 = 4(16 + y\u00b2)\n* Simplify: 96y\u00b2 - 160y = 0\n* Factor: 16y(6y - 10) = 0\n* Solutions: y = 0 or y = 5/3\n**6.  Interpreting the Solutions**\n* **y = 0:** This solution corresponds to a circle with center at (0,0), but this circle doesn't pass through the point (0,5). So, this solution is not valid.\n* **y = 5/3:** This solution gives us the center of a valid circle.\n**7.  Conclusion**\nThere is **one** circle that satisfies the given conditions, and its center is at the point (0, 5/3). \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Visualize the Situation**\nImagine the two circles of radius 1 centered at (4,0) and (-4,0).  They are 8 units apart. The point (0,5) lies directly above the midpoint of the segment connecting the centers of the two circles.\n**2. Consider the Tangency Condition**\nA circle is tangent to another circle if they share exactly one point in common.  This point is where the tangent line to the smaller circle passes through the center of the larger circle.\n**3. Find the Center of the Desired Circle**\nLet the center of the desired circle be (h,k).  Since this circle passes through (0,5), the distance between (h,k) and (0,5) is equal to the radius of the desired circle.  Let's call this radius r.  So we have:\n  \u221a((h-0)\u00b2 + (k-5)\u00b2) = r\nAlso, since the desired circle is tangent to the circle centered at (4,0), the distance between (h,k) and (4,0) is equal to r + 1 (the sum of the radii of the two circles).  Therefore:\n  \u221a((h-4)\u00b2 + (k-0)\u00b2) = r + 1\nSimilarly, the distance between (h,k) and (-4,0) is also equal to r + 1:\n  \u221a((h+4)\u00b2 + (k-0)\u00b2) = r + 1\n**4. Solve the System of Equations**\nWe have three equations and three unknowns (h, k, r).  Let's solve for them:\n* **Square the first equation:** (h\u00b2 + (k-5)\u00b2) = r\u00b2\n* **Square the second equation:** (h-4)\u00b2 + k\u00b2 = (r+1)\u00b2\n* **Square the third equation:** (h+4)\u00b2 + k\u00b2 = (r+1)\u00b2\nNotice that the second and third equations are identical. This tells us that the center of the desired circle must lie on the perpendicular bisector of the segment connecting the centers of the original circles. \n* **Simplify the squared equations:** \n    * h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 - 10k + 25 = r\u00b2\n    * h\u00b2 - 8h + 16 + k\u00b2 = r\u00b2 + 2r + 1 \n    * h\u00b2 + 8h + 16 + k\u00b2 = r\u00b2 + 2r + 1\n* **Subtract the second and third equations from the first:**\n    * 8h + 10k = 24 \n    * -16h = 0\n* **Solve for h and k:**\n    * h = 0\n    * k = 2.4\n* **Substitute h and k back into the first equation to find r:**\n    * 0\u00b2 + (2.4 - 5)\u00b2 = r\u00b2\n    * r = \u221a(6.76) = 2.6\n**5. Conclusion**\nWe have found that the center of the desired circle is at (0, 2.4) and its radius is 2.6. Since there's only one solution that satisfies all the given conditions, there is **only one circle** that meets the requirements. \n",
        "Here's a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n**1. Visualize the Situation**\nImagine the two circles of radius 1 centered at (4,0) and (-4,0).  The point (0,5) lies directly above the midpoint of the segment connecting the centers of these circles. \n**2. Consider the Center of the Tangent Circle**\nLet the center of a circle that is tangent to both given circles and passes through (0,5) be (0,y).  Notice that this center must lie on the y-axis due to symmetry.\n**3. Use the Distance Formula**\n* The distance from (0,y) to (4,0) must be equal to the radius of the tangent circle plus 1 (the radius of one of the given circles).  This distance is \u221a(y\u00b2 + 16).\n* The distance from (0,y) to (0,5) is simply |y-5|. This is also the radius of the tangent circle.\n**4. Set Up an Equation**\nWe can now set up an equation using the information above:\n\u221a(y\u00b2 + 16) = |y-5| + 1\n**5. Solve for y**\n* Square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root: y\u00b2 + 16 = (y-5)\u00b2 + 2(y-5) + 1\n* Simplify the equation: y\u00b2 + 16 = y\u00b2 - 8y + 25 + 2y - 10 + 1\n* Combine terms and solve for y: 6y = 10 \n* Therefore, y = 5/3\n**6. Find the Radius**\nThe radius of the tangent circle is |y-5| = |5/3 - 5| = 10/3.\n**7.  Determine the Number of Circles**\nSince we found a valid value for y, there exists at least one circle that meets the given conditions.  Furthermore, due to symmetry, we can reflect this circle across the x-axis to find another circle that also satisfies the conditions.\n**Answer:** There are **two** circles that are tangent to both of the given circles and also pass through the point (0,5). \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem:\n**1. Visualize the Setup**\nImagine two circles of radius 1, one centered at (4, 0) and the other at (-4, 0).  The point (0, 5) lies above these circles. We want to find circles that are tangent to both of the given circles and pass through (0, 5).\n**2.  Consider the Geometry**\n* **Tangency:**  When a circle is tangent to another circle, the line connecting their centers passes through the point of tangency.\n* **Symmetry:** Since the two given circles are symmetrical about the y-axis, any circle tangent to both must also be symmetrical about the y-axis. \n**3.  Focus on the Center of the Desired Circle**\nLet the center of our desired circle be (0, y).  Since the circle passes through (0, 5), its radius is 5 - y.\n**4.  Use the Distance Formula**\n* The distance from (0, y) to (4, 0) is equal to the sum of the radii of the two circles:  \u221a(16 + y\u00b2) = 1 + (5 - y). \n* Similarly, the distance from (0, y) to (-4, 0) is also equal to the sum of the radii: \u221a(16 + y\u00b2) = 1 + (5 - y).\n**5.  Solve the Equation**\nWe have a single equation: \n\u221a(16 + y\u00b2) = 6 - y\nSquaring both sides gives:\n16 + y\u00b2 = 36 - 12y + y\u00b2\n12y = 20\ny = 5/3\n**6.  Verify**\nWe found a possible value for y, but we need to check if it satisfies the original conditions:\n* **Radius:**  The radius of the desired circle is 5 - y = 5 - 5/3 = 10/3. \n* **Tangency:** The distance from (0, 5/3) to (4, 0) is \u221a(16 + 25/9) = \u221a(169/9) = 13/3, which is equal to the sum of the radii (1 + 10/3 = 13/3).  The same is true for the distance to (-4, 0).\n**7.  Conclusion**\nWe've found one circle that meets all the conditions. Since the problem asks for *how many* circles, and we've found one, the answer is **1**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Visualize the Problem**\nImagine the two circles of radius 1 centered at (4, 0) and (-4, 0).  Also, imagine the point (0, 5).  We want to find circles that touch both of the original circles and pass through (0, 5).\n**2. Key Insights**\n* **Symmetry:** Due to the symmetry of the problem, any circle that satisfies the conditions will have its center on the y-axis.  This is because the line segment connecting the centers of the two given circles is horizontal, and the point (0, 5) lies directly above the midpoint of this segment. \n* **Distance:**  The distance between the center of a solution circle and each of the given circles will be equal to the radius of the solution circle.\n**3.  Setting Up the Equation**\nLet the center of a solution circle be (0, y).  Let the radius of this solution circle be r.  Then we have two conditions:\n* **Condition 1:** The distance from (0, y) to (4, 0) is r + 1 (the radius of the solution circle plus the radius of one of the given circles).  Using the distance formula:\n   \u221a((0 - 4)\u00b2 + (y - 0)\u00b2) = r + 1 \n   \u221a(16 + y\u00b2) = r + 1\n* **Condition 2:**  The distance from (0, y) to (0, 5) is r (the radius of the solution circle). Using the distance formula:\n   \u221a((0 - 0)\u00b2 + (y - 5)\u00b2) = r\n   \u221a(y\u00b2 - 10y + 25) = r\n**4. Solving the System of Equations**\nWe now have two equations with two unknowns (r and y):\n* \u221a(16 + y\u00b2) = r + 1 \n* \u221a(y\u00b2 - 10y + 25) = r\nSquaring both sides of each equation, we get:\n* 16 + y\u00b2 = r\u00b2 + 2r + 1\n* y\u00b2 - 10y + 25 = r\u00b2\nSubtracting the second equation from the first, we get:\n* 16 + 10y - 25 = 2r + 1\n* 10y - 10 = 2r \n* 5y - 5 = r\nNow, substitute this value of r into the second equation (y\u00b2 - 10y + 25 = r\u00b2):\n* y\u00b2 - 10y + 25 = (5y - 5)\u00b2\n* y\u00b2 - 10y + 25 = 25y\u00b2 - 50y + 25\n* 0 = 24y\u00b2 - 40y\n* 0 = 4y(6y - 10)\nThis gives us two possible solutions: y = 0 and y = 5/3.\n**5. Checking the Solutions**\n* **y = 0:** This solution corresponds to a circle that passes through (0, 5) but does not touch both of the given circles. It is not a valid solution.\n* **y = 5/3:** This solution leads to a valid circle that touches both given circles and passes through (0, 5).\n**6. Conclusion**\nTherefore, there is **one** circle that satisfies the given conditions. \n"
