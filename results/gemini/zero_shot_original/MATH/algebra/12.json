        "The distance from the origin (0, 0) to a point (x, y) can be found using the distance formula, which is derived from the Pythagorean theorem:\nDistance = \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)\nIn this case, the point is (-8, 6). So:\nDistance = \u221a((-8)\u00b2 + (6)\u00b2)\nDistance = \u221a(64 + 36)\nDistance = \u221a100\nDistance = 10\nTherefore, the distance from the origin to the point (-8, 6) is **10 units**. \n",
        "Here's how to find the distance from the origin (0, 0) to the point (-8, 6):\n**1. Visualize the Problem**\nImagine a right triangle where:\n* The origin (0, 0) is one corner.\n* The point (-8, 6) is another corner.\n* The third corner is directly below (-8, 6) on the x-axis at the point (-8, 0).\n**2.  Find the Lengths of the Triangle's Sides**\n* The horizontal side (along the x-axis) has a length of 8 units (from 0 to -8).\n* The vertical side (along the y-axis) has a length of 6 units (from 0 to 6).\n**3. Use the Pythagorean Theorem**\nThe distance from the origin to the point is the hypotenuse of this right triangle.
