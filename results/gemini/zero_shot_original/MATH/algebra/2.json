        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**Understanding the Problem**\n* **Ceiling Function:** The ceiling function, denoted by $\\lceil x \\rceil$, gives the smallest integer greater than or equal to *x*. For example,  $\\lceil 3.2 \\rceil = 4$ and $\\lceil -1.7 \\rceil = -1$.\n**Solving the Equation**\n1. **Consider the possibilities for  $\\lceil x \\rceil$:** Since $\\lceil x \\rceil$ is an integer, we need to find integer values that, when added to *x*, result in a fraction close to 23/7.  Let's start by thinking about the range of possible values for $\\lceil x \\rceil$.\n2. **Estimate:** Since 23/7 is a little over 3,  $\\lceil x \\rceil$ must be 3 or 4. Let's try both:\n   * **Case 1:  $\\lceil x \\rceil = 3$** \n      * Substitute into the equation:  3 + *x* = 23/7\n      * Solve for *x*: *x* = 23/7 - 3 = 2/7 \n      * Check: Since 2/7 is less than 1,  $\\lceil 2/7 \\rceil = 1$. This doesn't work because we need $\\lceil x \\rceil = 3$.\n   * **Case 2: $\\lceil x \\rceil = 4$**\n      * Substitute into the equation:  4 + *x* = 23/7\n      * Solve for *x*: *x* = 23/7 - 4 = -9/7\n      * Check: Since -9/7 is between -2 and -1,  $\\lceil -9/7 \\rceil = -1$. This doesn't work because we need $\\lceil x \\rceil = 4$.\n**The Solution**\nNeither case satisfies the conditions of the problem. Therefore, there is **no solution** for *x* that satisfies the equation $\\lceil x \\rceil + x = \\dfrac{23}{7}$. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Ceiling Function**\nThe ceiling function, denoted by $\\lceil x \\rceil$, gives the smallest integer greater than or equal to $x$. For example:\n* $\\lceil 3.2 \\rceil = 4$\n* $\\lceil -1.7 \\rceil = -1$\n* $\\lceil 5 \\rceil = 5$\n**2. Analyze the Equation**\nWe have the equation: $\\lceil x \\rceil + x = \\dfrac{23}{7}$\nSince $\\lceil x \\rceil$ is an integer, let's consider the possible values of $\\lceil x \\rceil$ that would make the equation true.\n**3. Finding the Solution**\n* **If $\\lceil x \\rceil = 3$: **  The equation becomes  $3 + x = \\dfrac{23}{7}$. Solving for *x*, we get  $x = \\dfrac{2}{7}$.  This solution works because $\\lceil \\dfrac{2}{7} \\rceil = 1$.\n* **If $\\lceil x \\rceil = 4$: ** The equation becomes $4 + x = \\dfrac{23}{7}$. Solving for *x*, we get $x = -\\dfrac{5}{7}$. This solution does not work because $\\lceil -\\dfrac{5}{7} \\rceil = 0$, not 4.\n**4. Conclusion**\nTherefore, the only solution to the equation is  $x = \\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{7}}$. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n* **Ceiling Function:**  The ceiling function, denoted by $\\lceil x \\rceil$, gives the smallest integer greater than or equal to *x*. For example, $\\lceil 3.2 \\rceil = 4$ and $\\lceil -1.7 \\rceil = -1$.\n**Solving the Equation:**\n1. **Isolate the Ceiling Function:** \n   Subtract *x* from both sides of the equation:\n   ```\n   \u2308x\u2309 = (23/7) - x\n   ```\n2. **Consider Possibilities:**\n   Since the ceiling function gives an integer,  (23/7) - *x* must be an integer.  This means *x* must be a fraction with a denominator of 7. Let's write *x* in the form *x = a/7*, where *a* is an integer.\n3. **Substitute and Solve:**\n   Substitute *x = a/7* into the equation:\n   ```\n   \u2308a/7\u2309 = (23/7) - (a/7) \n   ```\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   ```\n   \u2308a/7\u2309 = (23 - a)/7\n   ```\n4. **Analyze the Ceiling Function:**\n   * If *a* is divisible by 7, then \u2308a/7\u2309 = a/7.  This means (23 - a)/7 = a/7, which leads to a = 11.5. Since *a* must be an integer, this case is not possible. \n   * If *a* is not divisible by 7, then \u2308a/7\u2309 is one more than the largest integer less than *a/7*. In other words, \u2308a/7\u2309 = (a/7) + 1.\n5. **Solve for *a*:**\n   Using the fact that \u2308a/7\u2309 = (a/7) + 1, we can rewrite the equation:\n   ```\n   (a/7) + 1 = (23 - a)/7\n   ```\n   Solving for *a*, we get:\n   ```\n   2a = 16\n   a = 8 \n   ```\n6. **Find *x*:**\n   Since *a* = 8, we have *x = a/7 = 8/7.\n**Answer:**\nTherefore, the solution is  *x* = **8/7**. \n",

Let's think about what this means:\n   * **If x is an integer:** The ceiling function of an integer is just the integer itself.  This means 23/7 - x would have to be an integer, which isn't possible. So, *x* cannot be an integer.\n   * **If x is not an integer:**  There's a difference between *x* and its ceiling.  The difference between *x* and its ceiling is always a value between 0 and 1 (exclusive). \n3. **Express 23/7 as a mixed number:** \n   23/7 is equal to 3 2/7.\n4. **Find the possible values of the ceiling function:**\n   Since 23/7 - x has to be an integer, the ceiling function, \u2308x\u2309, can only be 3 or 4.\n5. **Solve for x in each case:**\n   * **Case 1: \u2308x\u2309 = 3**\n     Substitute 3 for \u2308x\u2309 in the equation: \n     3 = 23/7 - x\n     x = 23/7 - 3 \n     x = 2/7\n   * **Case 2: \u2308x\u2309 = 4**\n     Substitute 4 for \u2308x\u2309 in the equation:\n     4 = 23/7 - x\n     x = 23/7 - 4 \n     x = -5/7\n6. **Check for validity:**\n   *  We need to make sure both solutions satisfy the original equation.  Since -5/7 is less than -1,  \u2308-5/7\u2309 = -1.  This doesn't satisfy the original equation.\n   *  The only solution that works is *x = 2/7*.\n**Therefore, the solution to the equation is x = 2/7.** \n",
