    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since $h(1)=5$, we have $a\\cdot 1 + b= 5$, so $a+b=5$. Since $h(-1) = 1$, we have $a\\cdot (-1) + b = 1$, so $-a + b=1$. Adding these two equations gives $2b=6$, so $b=3$.  From $a+b=5$, we find $a=2$. Therefore, $h(x) = 2x+3$, so $h(6) = 2\\cdot 6+3=\\boxed{15}$.",
