        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n* **Understanding the Absolute Value:**  The absolute value of a number is its distance from zero. So,  |a - b| represents the positive difference between *a* and *b*. \n* **Since a < b:**  We know that (a - b) is negative. To make it positive, we take its absolute value, which is -(a - b) or b - a. \n* **Substituting:** Now we can substitute this back into the original expression: \n    * |a - b| + a + b = (b - a) + a + b\n* **Simplifying:**  The *a* terms cancel out, leaving us with:\n    * (b - a) + a + b = **2b**\n**Therefore, the value of |a - b| + a + b is 2b.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this:\n**1. Understand the Absolute Value**\n* The absolute value of a number is its distance from zero.  It's always positive.\n* Since  $a < b$, we know that  $(a-b)$ is negative. \n**2. Simplify the Expression**\n* Because $(a-b)$ is negative, the absolute value makes it positive:  $|a-b| = -(a-b) = -a + b$.\n* Now substitute this back into the original expression:\n   *  $|a-b| + a + b = (-a + b) + a + b$\n**3. Combine Like Terms**\n* The 'a' terms cancel out:  -a + a = 0\n* We are left with:  b + b = 2b\n**Answer:** \nThe value of $|a-b| + a + b$ is **2b**. \n",
