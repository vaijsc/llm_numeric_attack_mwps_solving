    "problem": "A sequence starts with the term 2222. Each succeeding term is found by adding 1010 to the previous term. What is the sum of the sixth and seventh terms?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The $n$th term of the sequence is $2222+1010(n-1)$.  Therefore, the sum of the sixth and seventh terms is $2222+1010(5)+2222+1010(6)=4444+1010(11)=4444+11110=\\boxed{15554}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the sixth term:**\n* The first term is 2222.\n* To find the second term, add 1010: 2222 + 1010 = 3232\n* To find the third term, add 1010: 3232 + 1010 = 4242\n* Continue this pattern to find the sixth term: 4242 + 1010 = 5252 + 1010 = 6262 + 1010 = 7272\n**2. Find the seventh term:**\n*  The sixth term is 7272.\n*  Add 1010 to find the seventh term: 7272 + 1010 = 8282\n**3. Calculate the sum:**\n* Add the sixth and seventh terms: 7272 + 8282 = 15554\n**Therefore, the sum of the sixth and seventh terms is 15554.** \n",
