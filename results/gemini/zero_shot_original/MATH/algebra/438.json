        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**Understanding the Function**\n* **Floor Function:** The symbol $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ represents the greatest integer less than or equal to *x*. For example, $\\lfloor 3.7 \\rfloor = 3$ and $\\lfloor 5 \\rfloor = 5$.\n* **The Function:** The function $f(x) = x - \\lfloor \\sqrt{x} \\rfloor^2$ subtracts the square of the greatest integer less than or equal to the square root of *x* from *x*.\n**Evaluating the Sum**\n1. **Range of Values:** We need to find the values of $f(x)$ for $x$ from 101 to 110. \n2. **Square Roots:** Notice that the square root of 101 is between 10 and 11, and the square root of 110 is between 10 and 11 as well. This means the greatest integer less than or equal to the square root of each of these numbers is 10.\n3. **Calculation:** Let's calculate the values of *f(x)* for the given range:\n   *  $f(101) = 101 - 10^2 = 1$\n   *  $f(102) = 102 - 10^2 = 2$\n   *  $f(103) = 103 - 10^2 = 3$\n   *  ...\n   *  $f(110) = 110 - 10^2 = 10$\n4. **Sum:** The sum of the values is simply the sum of consecutive integers from 1 to 10. We can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: \n   *  Sum = (n/2)(first term + last term) \n   *  Sum = (10/2)(1 + 10) = 55\n**Answer**\nTherefore, $f(101) + f(102) + f(103) + \\cdots + f(110) = \\boxed{55}$. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**Understanding the Function**\n*  The function  $f(x) = x - \\lfloor \\sqrt{x} \\rfloor^2$  takes a number *x*, finds its square root, rounds it down to the nearest integer (using the floor function, denoted by $\\lfloor \\cdot \\rfloor$), squares that integer, and subtracts the result from the original number *x*. \n**Example**\nLet's find  $f(101)$:\n1.  $\\sqrt{101} \\approx 10.05$\n2.  $\\lfloor \\sqrt{101} \\rfloor = 10$\n3.  $10^2 = 100$\n4.  $f(101) = 101 - 100 = 1$\n**The Pattern**\nNotice that for numbers within a range where the floor of their square roots is the same, the function behaves predictably. For example:\n* $f(101) = 1$\n* $f(102) = 2$\n* ...\n* $f(110) = 10$\nThis is because the $\\lfloor \\sqrt{x} \\rfloor^2$ term remains constant while *x* increases.\n**Calculating the Sum**\nSince $\\lfloor \\sqrt{101} \\rfloor = \\lfloor \\sqrt{110} \\rfloor = 10$, we can directly calculate the sum:\n$f(101) + f(102) + f(103) + \\cdots + f(110) = 1 + 2 + 3 + \\cdots + 10$\nThis is the sum of the first 10 positive integers, which has a known formula:\n$1 + 2 + 3 + \\cdots + 10 = \\frac{10 \\times 11}{2} = \\boxed{55}$ \n",
