This means we need to:\n* Find the solutions (roots) of the quadratic equation.\n* Square each solution.\n* Add the squared solutions together.\n**2. Find the Solutions**\nWe can use the quadratic formula to find the solutions of the equation  2x\u00b2 + 4x - 1 = 0:\n* **Quadratic Formula:**  x = [-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)] / 2a\n* **Identify a, b, and c:**  In our equation, a = 2, b = 4, and c = -1.\n* **Substitute:** x = [-4 \u00b1 \u221a(4\u00b2 - 4 * 2 * -1)] / (2 * 2)\n* **Simplify:** x = [-4 \u00b1 \u221a(24)] / 4 = [-4 \u00b1 2\u221a6] / 4\n* **Solutions:**  \n    * x\u2081 = (-4 + 2\u221a6) / 4 = (-1 + \u221a6)/2\n    * x\u2082 = (-4 - 2\u221a6) / 4 = (-1 - \u221a6)/2\n**3. Square the Solutions**\n* x\u2081\u00b2 = [(-1 + \u221a6)/2]\u00b2 = (1 - 2\u221a6 + 6) / 4 = (7 - 2\u221a6) / 4\n* x\u2082\u00b2 = [(-1 - \u221a6)/2]\u00b2 = (1 + 2\u221a6 + 6) / 4 = (7 + 2\u221a6) / 4\n**4. Sum the Squared Solutions**\n* x\u2081\u00b2 + x\u2082\u00b2 = (7 - 2\u221a6) / 4 + (7 + 2\u221a6) / 4 \n* Simplify:  (7 + 7) / 4 = 14 / 4 = **7/2**\n**Therefore, the sum of the squares of the solutions to the equation 2x\u00b2 + 4x - 1 = 0 is 7/2.** \n",

We can use a helpful algebraic trick:\n(r + s)\u00b2 = r\u00b2 + 2rs + s\u00b2\nNow, solve for *r\u00b2 + s\u00b2*:\n*r\u00b2 + s\u00b2 = (r + s)\u00b2 - 2rs*\nSubstitute the values we know from Vieta's formulas:\n*r\u00b2 + s\u00b2 = (-2)\u00b2 - 2(-1/2)*\n**5.
