    "solution": "Let the energy of a photon equal $E$ and the wavelength equal $\\lambda$.  Since the wavelength is inversely proportional to the energy, the product $E\\lambda$ must be equal to some constant, say $k$.  Given photons of red light with a wavelength of $7\\times10^{-7}$, we can write: \\begin{align*}\nE(7\\times10^{-7})&=k\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 7\\times10^{-7}&=\\frac{k}{E}\n\\end{align*} Now, we are asked to find the wavelength of a photon with 2000 times the energy of red light.  Substitute $2000E$ for $E$ in the original expression: \\begin{align*}\n(2000E)\\lambda&=k\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad \\lambda&=\\frac{k}{2000E}\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{2000}\\cdot\\frac{k}{E}\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{2\\times10^3}\\cdot7\\times10^{-7}\\\\\n&={3.5\\times10^{-10} \\text{ meters}}\n\\end{align*} Therefore, we have $a+b = \\boxed{-6.5}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Relationship**\n* **Inverse Proportionality:**  If energy is inversely proportional to wavelength, it means that as energy increases, wavelength decreases, and vice versa.  This can be represented by the equation: \n   * Energy * Wavelength = constant\n**2. Set up the Proportion**\nLet:\n*  *E* represent the energy of a photon of red light\n*  *\u03bb* represent the wavelength of a photon of red light \n*  *\u03bb' * represent the wavelength of the photon with 2000 times the energy\nSince energy is inversely proportional to wavelength, we can set up the following proportion:\n*  *E* * \u03bb* = 2000*E* * \u03bb' * \n**3. Solve for \u03bb'**\nSimplify the proportion and solve for \u03bb':\n*  \u03bb' = (1/2000) * \u03bb\n**4. Substitute the Wavelength of Red Light**\nSubstitute the given wavelength of red light,  \u03bb = 7 * 10\u207b\u2077 meters:\n*  \u03bb' = (1/2000) * (7 * 10\u207b\u2077 meters)\n*  \u03bb' = 3.5 * 10\u207b\u00b9\u2070 meters\n**5. Express in Scientific Notation**\nThe wavelength of the more energetic photon is 3.5 * 10\u207b\u00b9\u2070 meters.\n**6. Calculate a + b**\n*  a = 3.5\n*  b = -10\n*  a + b = 3.5 - 10 = **-6.5** \n**Therefore, a + b is -6.5** \n",

This means that as the wavelength increases, the energy decreases, and vice versa. \n**2. Set up a proportion:**\n* Let *E* represent the energy of a photon and *\u03bb* represent its wavelength. We can write the inverse proportion as: \n   *E/\u03bb = constant*\n* Since we're dealing with two photons, we can set up a proportion:\n   *E\u2081/\u03bb\u2081 = E\u2082/\u03bb\u2082*\n**3.

Solve for \u03bb\u2082:**\n* Substitute the known values into the proportion:\n   *(2000 * E\u2081)/(\u03bb\u2082) = E\u2081/(7 x 10\u207b\u2077)*\n* Simplify and solve for \u03bb\u2082:\n   *\u03bb\u2082 = (2000 * E\u2081 * 7 x 10\u207b\u2077) / E\u2081*\n   *\u03bb\u2082 = 14 x 10\u207b\u2074 meters*\n**5. Express the answer in scientific notation:**\n* \u03bb\u2082 = 1.4 x 10\u207b\u00b3 meters\n**6. Calculate a + b:**\n* a = 1.4\n* b = -3\n* a + b = 1.4 - 3 = -1.6\n**Therefore, a + b = -1.6** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the relationship between energy and wavelength:**\n* The energy of a photon is inversely proportional to its wavelength. This means that as the wavelength gets shorter, the energy gets higher, and vice versa.  Mathematically, this can be represented as:  \n   * Energy (E) =  (constant) / wavelength (\u03bb) \n**2. Set up a proportion:**\n* Since the energy is 2000 times greater, the wavelength will be 2000 times smaller.  Let the new wavelength be  *x*. We can write this as a proportion:\n   * 1 / (7 * 10^-7) = 2000 / *x*\n**3. Solve for *x*:**\n* Cross-multiply:  *x* = 2000 * (7 * 10^-7)\n* Simplify:  *x* = 14 * 10^-4 \n* Rewrite in scientific notation:  *x* = 1.4 * 10^-3\n**4. Find a + b:**\n* In scientific notation, *x* = 1.4 * 10^-3, so *a* = 1.4 and *b* = -3\n* Therefore, *a* + *b* = 1.4 + (-3) = **-1.6** \n",
