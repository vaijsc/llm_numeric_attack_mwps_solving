    "solution": "2 p.m. New York time is noon in Denver.  45 hours past noon is 21 hours past noon the next day, which is 9 a.m. the day after that.  Think about it this way - 48 hours would mean two full days, and 45 hours is 3 hours less than that, thus, 3 hours before noon is $\\boxed{9\\text{ a.m.}}$",

        "Here's how to solve this step by step:\n1. **Time difference:** Denver is 2 hours behind New York.\n2. **Train departure time in Denver:**  Since the train leaves New York at 2 p.m. New York time, it leaves Denver at 12 p.m. Denver time (2 p.m. - 2 hours).\n3. **Total travel time in Denver time:** The train arrives in Denver 45 hours after leaving New York.  Because Denver is 2 hours behind, the total travel time in Denver time is 45 hours + 2 hours = 47 hours.\n4. **Arrival time in Denver:** The train leaves Denver at 12 p.m. and travels for 47 hours.  Therefore, the train arrives in Denver at 12 p.m. + 47 hours = **1 p.m. the next day**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step by step:\n* **Time difference:** Denver is 2 hours behind New York (12:00 PM in New York - 10:00 AM in Denver = 2 hours).\n* **Train departure in Denver time:** Since the train leaves New York at 2:00 PM, and Denver is 2 hours behind, it would be 12:00 PM in Denver when the train leaves New York.\n* **Total travel time in Denver time:**  The train takes 45 hours. Since Denver is 2 hours behind, the train will have been traveling for 45 hours + 2 hours = 47 hours in Denver time.\n* **Arrival time in Denver:**  If the train departs at 12:00 PM Denver time and travels for 47 hours, it will arrive at 12:00 PM + 47 hours = 1:00 PM the next day.\n**Therefore, the train will arrive in Denver at 1:00 PM (Denver time).** \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this step-by-step:\n1. **Time difference:** Denver is 2 hours behind New York.\n2. **Train departure time in Denver:** Since it's 2 p.m. in New York when the train departs, it's 12 p.m. (noon) in Denver.\n3. **Total travel time in Denver time:** The train travels for 45 hours, and since Denver is 2 hours behind, the travel time in Denver time is 45 hours - 2 hours = 43 hours.\n4. **Arrival time in Denver:**  Add the travel time in Denver time to the departure time in Denver: 12 p.m. + 43 hours = 1 p.m. the next day.\n**Therefore, the train arrives in Denver at 1 p.m. the following day.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Calculate the time difference:**\n* New York is 2 hours ahead of Denver.\n**2. Determine the time in Denver when the train departs:**\n* Since New York is 2 hours ahead, when it's 2 p.m. in New York, it's 12 p.m. (noon) in Denver.\n**3. Calculate the arrival time in Denver based on the time difference:**\n* The train travels for 45 hours.\n* Denver is 2 hours behind New York, so for every hour that passes in New York, only 58 minutes pass in Denver.\n* Therefore, the train arrives in Denver 45 hours * 58 minutes/hour = 2610 minutes after noon in Denver.\n**4. Convert the arrival time to hours and minutes:**\n* 2610 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 43.5 hours.\n* This means the train arrives 43 hours and 30 minutes after noon in Denver.\n**5.  Determine the final arrival time in Denver:**\n* Noon in Denver plus 43 hours and 30 minutes is 12:30 p.m. the following day.\n**Therefore, the train arrives in Denver at 12:30 p.m. the day after it departs from New York.** \n",
