        "Here's how to find the values of *x* that are not in the domain of the function:\n**1. Understand the Domain**\nThe domain of a function is the set of all possible input values (x-values) for which the function produces a valid output.  \n**2. Identify Potential Problems**\nThe function  *f(x)* has two potential issues that could lead to values not being in the domain:\n* **Division by Zero:** The denominator of the function cannot be zero.\n* **Absolute Value:** While absolute values are defined for all real numbers, we need to make sure the expressions inside the absolute value signs don't create any other issues.\n**3. Analyze the Denominator**\nLet's analyze the denominator, *|x\u00b2 + 3x - 4| + |x\u00b2 + 9x + 20|*.\n* **Factoring:** Factor the quadratic expressions inside the absolute values:\n    * |x\u00b2 + 3x - 4| = |(x + 4)(x - 1)|\n    * |x\u00b2 + 9x + 20| = |(x + 4)(x + 5)|\n* **Zero Values:** The denominator will be zero if either of the factored expressions equals zero.  This happens when:\n    * x + 4 = 0  => x = -4\n    * x - 1 = 0  => x = 1\n    * x + 5 = 0  => x = -5\n**4. Conclusion**\nSince the denominator cannot be zero, the values *x = -4, x = 1*, and *x = -5* are not in the domain of the function *f(x)*.\n**Therefore, the real values of *x* not in the domain of the function are x = -5, x = -4, and x = 1.** \n",
        "Here's how to find the values of *x* that are not in the domain of the function:\n**1. Understand Domain Restrictions**\nThe function is a fraction.  The only way a fraction can be undefined is if the denominator is zero.  \n**2. Analyze the Denominator**\nThe denominator is: \n$|x^2 + 3x - 4| + |x^2 + 9x + 20|$\nNotice that the absolute values make both terms *always* non-negative.  The sum of two non-negative numbers can only be zero if both numbers are zero.\n**3. Set Each Absolute Value to Zero**\n* **First Absolute Value:**  We need to find the values of *x* that make  *x\u00b2 + 3x - 4* equal to zero.  Factor this quadratic: (x + 4)(x - 1) = 0.  This gives us solutions x = -4 and x = 1.\n* **Second Absolute Value:** We need to find the values of *x* that make *x\u00b2 + 9x + 20* equal to zero.  Factor this quadratic: (x + 4)(x + 5) = 0. This gives us solutions x = -4 and x = -5.\n**4. Determine the Values that Make the Denominator Zero**\nWe see that the only value of *x* that makes *both* absolute values zero is *x = -4*.\n**5. State the Domain**\nThe domain of the function is all real numbers except for *x = -4*.  We can express this in interval notation as:\n**(-\u221e, -4) \u222a (-4, \u221e)** \n",
        "Here's how to find the values of *x* that are not in the domain of the function:\n**1. Understand Domain Restrictions**\nThe domain of a function is the set of all possible input values (x-values) for which the function produces a valid output.  There are two main restrictions we need to consider:\n* **Division by Zero:**  We cannot divide by zero.  Therefore, the denominator of our function cannot equal zero.\n* **Absolute Values:** Absolute values are always non-negative. This means the denominator will always be positive, and we don't have to worry about it being undefined due to a negative value.\n**2. Analyze the Denominator**\nOur denominator is: \n```\n|x^2 + 3x - 4| + |x^2 + 9x + 20|\n```\nWe need to find the values of *x* that make this denominator equal to zero.  To do this, we'll analyze each absolute value separately:\n* **|x\u00b2 + 3x - 4|:**\n   * Factor the quadratic:  (x + 4)(x - 1)\n   * This expression is zero when x = -4 or x = 1.\n* **|x\u00b2 + 9x + 20|:**\n   * Factor the quadratic:  (x + 4)(x + 5)\n   * This expression is zero when x = -4 or x = -5.\n**3. Combine the Solutions**\nWe've found that the following values of *x* make one or both of the absolute value expressions equal to zero:\n* x = -5\n* x = -4\n* x = 1\n**4. Exclude from the Domain**\nSince these values make the denominator zero, they are excluded from the domain of the function. \n**Therefore, the real values of *x* that are not in the domain of the function are x = -5, x = -4, and x = 1.** \n",
        "Here's how to find the values of *x* that are not in the domain of the function:\n**1. Understanding Domain**\nThe domain of a function is the set of all possible input values (in this case, *x* values) for which the function produces a valid output.  \n**2. Identifying Potential Issues**\nThe function *f(x)* has two potential issues that could lead to an undefined output:\n* **Division by Zero:** The denominator cannot be zero. \n* **Absolute Value of a Negative Number:** The absolute value of a negative number is its positive counterpart, but it is crucial to ensure that the expressions inside the absolute value signs don't result in negative values when calculating the absolute value. However, this is not an issue in this case since the absolute value of any number is always non-negative.\n**3. Analyzing the Denominator**\nLet's focus on the denominator:\n* **|x\u00b2 + 3x - 4| + |x\u00b2 + 9x + 20|** \nTo make this denominator zero, both absolute value expressions would need to be zero simultaneously.\n**4. Factoring the Quadratics**\nLet's factor the quadratic expressions inside the absolute values:\n* **|x\u00b2 + 3x - 4| = |(x + 4)(x - 1)|**\n* **|x\u00b2 + 9x + 20| = |(x + 4)(x + 5)|**\n**5. Finding Values that Make the Denominator Zero**\nFor the denominator to be zero, both factors (x + 4) and (x - 1) must be zero simultaneously. But this is impossible because a single value of *x* cannot satisfy both conditions. \nSimilarly, both factors (x + 4) and (x + 5) must be zero simultaneously. However, this is also impossible.\n**6. Conclusion**\nSince there are no real values of *x* that make the denominator zero, the function *f(x)* is defined for all real numbers. Therefore, the domain of *f(x)* is **all real numbers**.\n**In other words, there are no real values of *x* that are not in the domain of *f(x)*.** \n",
