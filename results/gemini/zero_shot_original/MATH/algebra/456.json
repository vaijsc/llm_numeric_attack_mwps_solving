        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\n* We have a quadratic equation:  y = ax\u00b2 + bx - 6\n* The graph of this equation is a parabola.\n* The parabola is completely below the x-axis, meaning it has no x-intercepts. \n* We know a\u00b2 = 49, which means a could be 7 or -7.\n**2.  Key Concept: Discriminant**\n* The discriminant of a quadratic equation (ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0) is given by b\u00b2 - 4ac.\n* The discriminant tells us about the nature of the roots (x-intercepts) of the quadratic:\n    * If the discriminant is positive, the quadratic has two distinct real roots (two x-intercepts).\n    * If the discriminant is zero, the quadratic has one real root (one x-intercept, a double root).\n    * If the discriminant is negative, the quadratic has no real roots (no x-intercepts).\n**3. Applying the Discriminant**\n* Since the parabola is entirely below the x-axis, the quadratic has no real roots.  This means the discriminant must be negative:\n    * b\u00b2 - 4ac < 0\n**4. Substituting and Solving**\n* We know a\u00b2 = 49, so a = 7 or a = -7.  Let's consider both cases:\n    * **Case 1: a = 7** \n        * Substitute a = 7 and c = -6 into the inequality:\n           b\u00b2 - 4(7)(-6) < 0\n           b\u00b2 + 168 < 0\n           b\u00b2 < -168  (This is impossible, as a square cannot be negative)\n    * **Case 2: a = -7**\n        * Substitute a = -7 and c = -6 into the inequality:\n           b\u00b2 - 4(-7)(-6) < 0\n           b\u00b2 - 168 < 0\n           b\u00b2 < 168\n**5. Finding the Largest Integral Value of b**\n* Since b\u00b2 < 168, the largest possible integral value of b is just below the square root of 168.  \n* The square root of 168 is a little less than 13.\n* Therefore, the largest possible integral value of b is **12**. \n",

Finding the Largest Integer Value of 'b'**\nSince b\u00b2 < 168, we need to find the largest integer 'b' whose square is less than 168. \n* 13\u00b2 = 169, so 13 is too large.\n* 12\u00b2 = 144, so 12 satisfies the condition.\n**6.

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\n* **Parabola:** The equation represents a parabola.  Since it's completely below the x-axis, the parabola opens downward.\n* **Coefficient 'a':** The coefficient 'a' determines the direction of the parabola.  Since it opens downward, 'a' must be negative.\n* **Discriminant:** The discriminant of a quadratic equation tells us about the nature of its roots (where the parabola intersects the x-axis).  Since the parabola is completely below the x-axis, it has no real roots, meaning the discriminant must be negative.\n**2. Using the Given Information**\n* **a\u00b2 = 49:**  This means  a = 7 or a = -7. Since the parabola opens downward, we know a = -7.\n**3.  The Discriminant**\n* The discriminant of the quadratic  *ax\u00b2 + bx + c* is  *b\u00b2 - 4ac*.\n* In our case, the discriminant is *b\u00b2 - 4(-7)(-6) = b\u00b2 - 168*.\n* Since the parabola has no real roots, the discriminant is negative:  *b\u00b2 - 168 < 0*\n**4. Solving for 'b'**\n* *b\u00b2 < 168*\n* Take the square root of both sides: *|b| < \u221a168* \n* Simplify: *|b| < 4\u221a21* \n* Since 'b' can be positive or negative, the largest possible integral value of 'b' is **4\u221a21 - 1**.  \n**5. Approximation**\n* We know \u221a21 is slightly larger than \u221a16 = 4.\n* So, 4\u221a21 - 1 is slightly larger than 16 - 1 = 15.\n**6. Conclusion**\nThe largest possible integral value of 'b' is **15**. \n",
