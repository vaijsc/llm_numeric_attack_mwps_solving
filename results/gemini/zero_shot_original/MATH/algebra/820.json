        "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n**1. Define Variables:**\n* Let the smaller even perfect square be  $x^2$ \n* Since the squares are consecutive even numbers, the larger square is $(x+2)^2$\n**2. Set up the Equation:**\n* The problem states that the positive difference between the two squares is 268.  We can express this as an equation:\n   (x + 2)^2 - x^2 = 268\n**3. Solve the Equation:**\n* Expand the equation: \n   x^2 + 4x + 4 - x^2 = 268\n* Simplify:\n   4x + 4 = 268\n* Solve for x:\n   4x = 264\n   x = 66\n**4. Find the Larger Square:**\n* The larger square is (x + 2)^2, so substitute x = 66:\n   (66 + 2)^2 = 68^2 = **4624**\n**Therefore, the larger of the two squares is 4624.** \n",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Problem:**\n* **Consecutive even perfect squares:**  These are squares of consecutive even numbers (like 4 and 16, or 36 and 64).\n* **Positive difference:** We need to find the difference between the larger square and the smaller square.\n**2.
