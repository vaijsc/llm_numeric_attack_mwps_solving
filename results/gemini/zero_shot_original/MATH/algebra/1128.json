    "problem": "What is the smallest number which is one less than twice its reciprocal?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The question is asking us to find the smallest value of $x$ such that $x = 2\\cdot\\frac{1}{x} - 1$. We multiply through by $x$ to clear the fraction, then rearrange terms: $x^2 + x - 2 = 0$. This can be factored as $(x + 2)(x - 1) = 0$. We could also use the quadratic formula to find $x$: $$x = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1^2 - 4(1)(-2)}}{2}.$$ Either way, we find that $x = 1$ or $x = -2$. Since we want the smallest value of $x$, our answer is $\\boxed{-2}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Set up the equation:**\n* Let the number be represented by the variable 'x'.\n* The reciprocal of the number is 1/x.\n* Twice the reciprocal is 2/x.\n* One less than twice the reciprocal is (2/x) - 1.\nThe problem states that the number is one less than twice its reciprocal, so we can write the equation:\nx = (2/x) - 1\n**2. Solve for x:**\n* Multiply both sides of the equation by x to get rid of the fraction: \n   x\u00b2 = 2 - x\n* Move all terms to one side:\n   x\u00b2 + x - 2 = 0\n* Factor the quadratic equation:\n   (x + 2)(x - 1) = 0\n* Solve for x:\n   x = -2 or x = 1\n**3. Determine the smallest number:**\nWe have two possible solutions: -2 and 1. The smallest of these is **-2**.\n**Therefore, the smallest number which is one less than twice its reciprocal is -2.** \n",
