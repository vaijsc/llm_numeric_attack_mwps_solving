        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Express 'y' in terms of 'x' and 'z':**\n* From the equation  $2x = 5y$, we get  $y = \\frac{2x}{5}$.\n* From the equation $7y = 10z$, we get $y = \\frac{10z}{7}$.\n**2. Set the two expressions for 'y' equal to each other:**\n* Since both expressions represent the same value of 'y', we can write: \n   $\\frac{2x}{5} = \\frac{10z}{7}$\n**3. Solve for the ratio z/x:**\n* Multiply both sides of the equation by 5 and 7 to get rid of the denominators: \n   $14x = 50z$\n* Divide both sides by 14x and 50z to isolate z/x:\n   $\\frac{z}{x} = \\frac{14}{50}$\n**4. Simplify the fraction:**\n* Both 14 and 50 are divisible by 2.  Simplify to get:\n   $\\frac{z}{x} = \\boxed{\\frac{7}{25}}$ \n",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Isolate a Common Variable:**\n* We want to find the ratio of *z* to *x*.  Notice that both equations have *y* in them. Let's solve for *y* in both equations.\n* From the first equation,  $2x = 5y$, we get  $y = \\frac{2}{5}x$.\n* From the second equation, $7y = 10z$, we get $y = \\frac{10}{7}z$.\n**2.
