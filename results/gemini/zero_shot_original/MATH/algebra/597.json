        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Definition**\nThe problem defines a new operation \"*\". It tells us that  \"a * b\" is equivalent to \"2a + 3b\" for any values of 'a' and 'b'.\n**2. Substitute the Values**\nWe need to find the value of \"4 * 3\".  Let's substitute 'a' with 4 and 'b' with 3 in the definition:\n   4 * 3 = (2 * 4) + (3 * 3)\n**3. Simplify the Expression**\nNow, let's perform the arithmetic:\n   4 * 3 = 8 + 9\n**4. Calculate the Result**\nFinally, add the numbers:\n   4 * 3 = 17\n**Therefore, the value of 4 * 3 is 17.** \n",
