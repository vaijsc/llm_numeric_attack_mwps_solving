    "solution": "First we bring all the $x$ and $y$ terms to the left, and put all the other terms on the right.  This makes our system \\begin{align*} 3x+2y &=8,\\\\ 6x+4y&= 2a-7. \\end{align*}Multiplying the first equation by 2 makes its coefficients of $x$ and $y$ match those of the second equation: \\begin{align*} 6x+4y &=16,\\\\ 6x+4y&= 2a-7. \\end{align*}If $2a-7=16$, these equations will be the same, so the system will have infinitely many solutions. If $2a-7$ does not equal 16, then this system will have no solutions, since $6x+4y$ cannot equal two different numbers.  Solving $2a-7=16$ gives us $a=\\boxed{\\frac{23}{2}}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Rewrite the equations in standard form:**\nThe second equation can be rewritten as:\n$$6x + 4y = 2a - 7$$\n**2.  Look for relationships between the coefficients:**\n* Notice that the coefficients of *x* in the two equations are multiples of each other (3 and 6). \n* Also, the coefficients of *y* are multiples of each other (2 and 4).\n**3.  Infinite solutions occur when the equations are dependent:**\nFor a system of equations to have infinitely many solutions, the equations must be dependent.  This means one equation can be obtained by multiplying the other equation by a constant.\n**4.  Find the necessary value of 'a':**\nTo make the equations dependent, we need to find a value of 'a' such that the second equation is a multiple of the first equation.  Let's multiply the first equation by 2:\n$$2(3x + 2y) = 2(8)$$\n$$6x + 4y = 16$$\nNow, compare this to the rewritten second equation:\n$$6x + 4y = 2a - 7$$\nFor the equations to be dependent, we need:\n$$2a - 7 = 16$$\n**5.  Solve for 'a':**\nAdding 7 to both sides:\n$$2a = 23$$\nDividing both sides by 2:\n$$a = \\boxed{\\frac{23}{2}}$$\n**Therefore, when  a = 23/2, the system of equations has infinitely many solutions.** \n",
