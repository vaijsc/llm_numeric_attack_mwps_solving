        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n* **Practice 5:** Jenny made 48 free throws.\n* **Practice 4:** She made half as many at practice 4 as she did at practice 5, so she made 48 / 2 = 24 free throws.\n* **Practice 3:** She made half as many at practice 3 as she did at practice 4, so she made 24 / 2 = 12 free throws.\n* **Practice 2:** She made half as many at practice 2 as she did at practice 3, so she made 12 / 2 = 6 free throws.\n* **Practice 1:** She made half as many at practice 1 as she did at practice 2, so she made 6 / 2 = **3 free throws**.\n**Answer:** Jenny made 3 free throws at her first practice. \n",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n* **Practice 4:** Since Jenny made twice as many free throws at each practice, she made 48 / 2 = 24 free throws at her fourth practice.\n* **Practice 3:**  She made 24 / 2 = 12 free throws at her third practice.\n* **Practice 2:** She made 12 / 2 = 6 free throws at her second practice.\n* **Practice 1:** She made 6 / 2 = **3** free throws at her first practice. \n**Answer:** Jenny made 3 free throws at her first practice. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n* **Step 1: Work backwards.** Since Jenny made twice as many free throws at each practice, we need to work backward from her fifth practice.\n* **Step 2:  Divide by two.** At her fourth practice, Jenny made half the number of free throws she made at her fifth practice, so she made 48 / 2 = 24 free throws.\n* **Step 3: Continue dividing.** At her third practice, she made 24 / 2 = 12 free throws.\n   At her second practice, she made 12 / 2 = 6 free throws.\n* **Step 4: Final answer.**  At her first practice, she made 6 / 2 = **3 free throws**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step by step:\n* **Work backward:** Since Jenny doubled her free throws each practice, we need to work backward from her fifth practice to find her first practice.\n* **Fifth to Fourth:**  At her fourth practice, she made half as many free throws as her fifth practice, so she made 48 / 2 = 24 free throws.\n* **Fourth to Third:**  At her third practice, she made half as many free throws as her fourth practice, so she made 24 / 2 = 12 free throws.\n* **Third to Second:** At her second practice, she made half as many free throws as her third practice, so she made 12 / 2 = 6 free throws.\n* **Second to First:** At her first practice, she made half as many free throws as her second practice, so she made 6 / 2 = **3** free throws.\n**Answer:** Jenny made 3 free throws at her first practice. \n"
