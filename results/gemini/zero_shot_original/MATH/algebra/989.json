        "Here's how to rationalize the denominator of $\\frac{5}{\\sqrt{3}}$:\n**1. Multiply by 1 (in a clever way):**\nWe want to get rid of the radical in the denominator. To do this, we'll multiply both the numerator and denominator by $\\sqrt{3}$ (which is essentially multiplying by 1):\n$$\\frac{5}{\\sqrt{3}} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}}$$\n**2. Simplify:**\n* The numerator becomes $5\\sqrt{3}$.\n* The denominator becomes $(\\sqrt{3})(\\sqrt{3}) = 3$.\n**3. The Result:**\nThis gives us the simplified expression:\n$$\\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{3}$$ \n",
