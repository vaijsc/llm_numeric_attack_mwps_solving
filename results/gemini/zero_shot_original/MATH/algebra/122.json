        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Midpoint Formula**\nThe midpoint of a line segment is found by averaging the x-coordinates and averaging the y-coordinates of the endpoints.  The formula is:\nMidpoint =  ((x\u2081 + x\u2082)/2, (y\u2081 + y\u2082)/2)\n**2. Apply the Formula**\nWe know:\n*  One endpoint is (x, y)\n*  The other endpoint is (-9, 1)\n*  The midpoint is (3, -5)\nLet's plug these values into the midpoint formula:\n(3, -5) = ((x + (-9))/2, (y + 1)/2)\n**3. Solve for x and y**\nNow we have two separate equations:\n* 3 = (x - 9)/2 \n* -5 = (y + 1)/2\nSolve for x in the first equation:\n* 6 = x - 9 \n* x = 15\nSolve for y in the second equation:\n* -10 = y + 1\n* y = -11\n**4.
