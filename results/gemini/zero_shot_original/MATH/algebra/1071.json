        "Here's how to find the other solution:\n**1. Expand the equation:**\nThe given equation is: \n(x - p)(x - q) = (r - p)(r - q)\nExpanding both sides, we get:\nx\u00b2 - (p + q)x + pq = r\u00b2 - (p + q)r + pq\n**2. Simplify the equation:**\nNotice that the pq terms cancel out on both sides.  This leaves us with:\nx\u00b2 - (p + q)x = r\u00b2 - (p + q)r\n**3. Move all terms to one side:**\nTo solve for x, bring all terms to one side:\nx\u00b2 - (p + q)x - (r\u00b2 - (p + q)r) = 0\n**4. Recognize the quadratic equation:**\nWe now have a quadratic equation in the form ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0, where:\n* a = 1\n* b = -(p + q)\n* c = -(r\u00b2 - (p + q)r)\n**5. Factor the quadratic:**\nWe know that one solution is x = r.  This means (x - r) must be a factor of the quadratic.  To find the other factor, we can use the following reasoning:\nSince x = r is a solution, we can substitute it into the original equation:\n(r - p)(r - q) = (r - p)(r - q)\nThis is obviously true.  Therefore, the quadratic equation can be factored as:\n(x - r)(x - something) = 0\nTo find \"something\", we can look at the coefficient of x in the quadratic.  The coefficient of x in the factored form is -(r + \"something\").  This must be equal to -(p + q).  Therefore, \"something\" = (p + q - r).\n**6. The other solution:**\nThis means the other solution is:\nx = **(p + q - r)** \n",
        "Here's how to find the other solution:\n1. **Expand the equation:** \n   The equation $(x-p)(x-q) = (r-p)(r-q)$ expands to:\n   \n   $x^2 - (p+q)x + pq = (r-p)(r-q)$\n2. **Recognize the pattern:**\n   Notice that the right side of the equation is a constant.  This means the equation is a quadratic equation in the form of $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$.\n3. **Use the fact that x = r is a solution:**\n   Since $x=r$ is a solution, we know that when we substitute $x=r$ into the expanded equation, the equation holds true.  \n   Let's substitute:\n   $r^2 - (p+q)r + pq = (r-p)(r-q)$\n4. **Simplify the equation:** \n   We see that the right side of the equation is identical to the left side. This means the equation is already simplified.\n5. **Factor the quadratic:**\n   Now, we can factor the quadratic equation on the left side:\n   $(x-r)(x-p-q+r) = 0$\n6. **Find the other solution:**\n   For the product of two factors to be zero, at least one of the factors must be zero. We already know that $x=r$ makes the first factor zero. Therefore, the other solution must come from the second factor:\n   $x - p - q + r = 0$\n7. **Solve for x:**\n   Solving for x, we get:\n   $x = p + q - r$\n**Therefore, the other solution to the equation is  x = p + q - r.** \n",
        "Here's how to find the other solution:\n**1. Expand the equation:**\n*  Start by expanding both sides of the equation: \n   \n   *  $(x - p)(x - q) = x^2 - (p+q)x + pq$\n   *  $(r - p)(r - q) = r^2 - (p+q)r + pq$\n**2. Simplify the equation:**\n* Substitute the expanded forms back into the original equation:\n   \n   *  $x^2 - (p+q)x + pq = r^2 - (p+q)r + pq$\n*  Since  $pq$ appears on both sides, we can subtract it from both sides:\n   \n   *  $x^2 - (p+q)x = r^2 - (p+q)r$\n**3. Factor the equation:**\n* Notice that both sides have a common factor of $(x-r)$:\n   \n   *  $x(x - (p+q)) = r(r - (p+q))$\n   *  $(x-r)(x - (p+q)) = 0$\n**4. Find the solutions:**\n*  For the product of two factors to be zero, at least one of them must be zero. \n   *  We are given that $x = r$ is one solution, which means $(x-r) = 0$. \n   *  The other solution comes from setting the second factor equal to zero:\n     *  $x - (p+q) = 0$\n**5.  Solve for the other solution:**\n*  Adding $(p+q)$ to both sides gives us the other solution:\n   \n   *  $x = \\boxed{p + q}$ \n",
        "Here's how to find the other solution:\n**1. Expand the equation:**\nThe equation $(x-p)(x-q) = (r-p)(r-q)$ can be expanded as:\n  $x^2 - (p+q)x + pq = (r-p)(r-q)$\n**2. Notice a key pattern:**\nThe right side of the equation, $(r-p)(r-q)$, is a constant. This suggests that we can rearrange the equation to get a quadratic equation in the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$.\n**3. Rearrange the equation:**\nSubtract $(r-p)(r-q)$ from both sides:\n  $x^2 - (p+q)x + pq - (r-p)(r-q) = 0$\n**4. Factor the quadratic:**\nThe quadratic now has a constant term, and we know that $x = r$ is a solution. This means $(x-r)$ must be a factor of the quadratic.

Solve for the other solution:**\nSetting the second factor equal to zero gives us the other solution:\n  $x - (p+q-r) = 0$\n  $x = p + q - r$\n**Therefore, the other solution to the equation is  $x = p + q - r$.** \n",
