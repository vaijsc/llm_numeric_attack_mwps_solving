        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n1. **Combine the radicals:** Since the radicals have the same index (square root), we can combine them under a single radical:\n   \u221a(5x * 10x * 18x) = 30\n2. **Simplify the expression inside the radical:**\n   \u221a(900x\u00b3) = 30\n3. **Rewrite the expression:**\n   \u221a(900) * \u221a(x\u00b3) = 30\n4. **Evaluate the square root of 900:**\n   30 * \u221a(x\u00b3) = 30\n5. **Divide both sides by 30:**\n   \u221a(x\u00b3) = 1\n6. **Square both sides:**\n   x\u00b3 = 1\n7. **Solve for x:**\n   x = 1 \n**Therefore, x = 1.** \n",
