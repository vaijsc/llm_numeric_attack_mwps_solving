    "solution": "Our point lies on $5x-9y=42$ with the condition that $x=-y$. Thus, we have the system of equations \\begin{align*}\n5x-9y &= 42\\\\\nx &= -y.\n\\end{align*} Substituting $x= -y$ into the first equation gives  \\begin{align*}\n5(-y) -9y &=42\\\\\n\\Rightarrow -14y &= 42\\\\\n\\Rightarrow y &=-3.\n\\end{align*} Thus $x = -y = -(-3) = 3$, so our desired point is $\\boxed{(3,-3)}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the problem:**\nWe are looking for a point on the line where the x-coordinate and y-coordinate are additive inverses. This means they are the same number but with opposite signs. For example, (3, -3) or (-5, 5).\n**2. Set up the equation:**\nSince the x and y coordinates are additive inverses, we can write: \n  *  x = -y\n**3. Substitute into the line equation:**\nSubstitute -y for x in the equation of the line:\n  * 5(-y) - 9y = 42\n**4. Solve for y:**\nSimplify and solve for y:\n  * -5y - 9y = 42\n  * -14y = 42\n  * y = -3\n**5. Find x:**\nSince x = -y, we have:\n  * x = -(-3) = 3\n**6. The answer:**\nThe coordinates of the point are (3, -3). \n",
