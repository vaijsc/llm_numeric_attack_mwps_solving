        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Calculate the sum of all the numbers:**\nThe sum of the numbers 3, 5, 6, 7, and 9 is 30.  Since each number appears twice in the sums of the line segments, the sum of all five line segment sums is 2 * 30 = 60.\n**2.  Arithmetic Sequence Property:**\nIn an arithmetic sequence, the middle term is equal to the average of the first and last terms. Since we know the sum of all five terms is 60, the average of the terms is 60 / 5 = 12. \n**3.  The Middle Term:**\nTherefore, the middle term of the arithmetic sequence is **12**. \n",

Consider the sums of the line segments:**\nSince the sums of the line segments form an arithmetic sequence, the sum of the sums of the line segments must be equal to the sum of all the numbers (30) multiplied by the number of line segments (5): 30 * 5 = 150.\n**3.  Relate the sum of the line segments to the middle term:**\nLet the middle term of the arithmetic sequence be *x*.  The five terms of the arithmetic sequence can be represented as:\n* x - 2d\n* x - d\n* x\n* x + d\n* x + 2d\nWhere *d* is the common difference.  The sum of these terms is 5x, which we know is equal to 150. \n**4.  Solve for the middle term:**\n* 5x = 150\n* x = 30 \n**Therefore, the middle term of the arithmetic sequence is 30.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Find the sum of all the numbers:**\nThe sum of the numbers 3, 5, 6, 7, and 9 is 30.  Since each number appears twice in the sum of the five line segments (once for each end of the segment), the sum of the five line segments is 2 * 30 = 60.\n**2.  Arithmetic Sequences:**\nAn arithmetic sequence is a sequence where the difference between consecutive terms is constant.  Let the five line segment sums be represented by:\n*  a\n*  a + d\n*  a + 2d\n*  a + 3d\n*  a + 4d\nwhere 'a' is the first term and 'd' is the common difference.\n**3.  Set up an equation:**\nThe sum of the five line segment sums is 60, so we have:\na + (a + d) + (a + 2d) + (a + 3d) + (a + 4d) = 60\n**4.  Solve for the middle term:**\nSimplifying the equation:\n5a + 10d = 60\nDividing both sides by 5:\na + 2d = 12\nThe middle term of the arithmetic sequence is **a + 2d**, which is **12**. \n",

Since each number appears twice in the sum of the line segments, the total sum of the five line segments is 2 * 30 = 60.\n**2.  Arithmetic Sequence Property**\nIn an arithmetic sequence, the middle term is equal to the average of the first and last terms. Since we have a five-term arithmetic sequence, the middle term is the third term.\n**3.  Finding the Middle Term**\nThe sum of the five terms in the arithmetic sequence is 60.  Let the first term be *x* and the common difference be *d*.  Then the terms are:\n*  *x*\n*  *x + d*\n*  *x + 2d* \n*  *x + 3d*\n*  *x + 4d*\nThe sum of these terms is 5*x + 10*d = 60.  Dividing both sides by 5, we get:\n*x + 2d = 12*\nSince *x + 2d* is the third term (the middle term) of the arithmetic sequence, the middle term is **12**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1.  The Sum of the Numbers**\nThe sum of the five numbers is 3 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 9 = 30.  Since each number is used twice in the sums along the line segments, the total of the sums of the five line segments is 2 * 30 = 60.\n**2.  Arithmetic Sequence Properties**\nLet the five sums of the line segments be  *a*, *a + d*, *a + 2d*, *a + 3d*, and *a + 4d*.  Their sum is 5*a + 10*d = 60.\n**3.  Finding the Middle Term**\nThe middle term of the arithmetic sequence is *a + 2d*.  To find this, we need to find values for *a* and *d*. \n* Dividing the equation 5*a + 10*d = 60 by 5, we get *a* + 2*d = 12.\n**Therefore, the middle term of the arithmetic sequence is 12.** \n"
