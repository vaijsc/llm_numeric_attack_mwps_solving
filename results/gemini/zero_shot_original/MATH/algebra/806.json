    "solution": "Since the center of the target is 5 feet above the ground, $h=5$. So we get the quadratic: \\begin{align*}5& =10-23t-10t^{2}\n\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad 0& =10t^{2}+23t-5\n\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad 0&=(2t+5)(5t-1).\n\\end{align*}Thus, the values of $t$ that satisfy the equation are $-\\frac52$ and $\\frac15$. However, since time can never be a negative number, the answer must be $\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{5}}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n* We have an equation that describes the height (h) of the arrow at any time (t).\n* We need to find the time (t) when the arrow reaches a height of 5 feet (the target's center).\n**2. Set up the Equation**\n* We want to find the time (t) when the arrow's height (h) is 5 feet.  So, we set the equation equal to 5: \n   5 = 10 - 23t - 10t\u00b2\n**3. Rearrange the Equation**\n* Move all terms to one side to get a quadratic equation:\n   10t\u00b2 + 23t - 5 = 0\n**4. Solve the Quadratic Equation**\n*  We can solve for 't' using the quadratic formula:\n   t = [-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)] / 2a\n   Where:\n      * a = 10\n      * b = 23\n      * c = -5\n* Substitute the values into the formula and solve:\n   t = [-23 \u00b1 \u221a(23\u00b2 - 4 * 10 * -5)] / (2 * 10)\n   t = [-23 \u00b1 \u221a(729)] / 20\n   t = [-23 \u00b1 27] / 20\n* This gives us two possible solutions:\n   * t = 0.2 seconds\n   * t = -2.5 seconds \n**5. Interpret the Solution**\n* Time cannot be negative, so we discard the solution t = -2.5 seconds. \n* Therefore, the arrow will reach the target's center in **0.2 seconds**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n1. **Set up the equation:** We need to find the time (t) when the arrow reaches a height of 5 feet (the target's center).  So, we'll set the height equation equal to 5:\n   \n   ```\n   5 = 10 - 23t - 10t^2 \n   ```\n2. **Rearrange the equation:** To make it easier to solve, let's rearrange the equation into a standard quadratic form:\n   ```\n   10t^2 + 23t + 5 = 0\n   ```\n3. **Solve the quadratic equation:** We can solve for *t* using the quadratic formula:\n   ```\n   t = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n   ```\n   Where *a* = 10, *b* = 23, and *c* = 5. \n4. **Calculate the solutions:** Substitute the values of *a*, *b*, and *c* into the quadratic formula and solve for *t*:\n   ```\n   t = (-23 \u00b1 \u221a(23\u00b2 - 4 * 10 * 5)) / (2 * 10)\n   t = (-23 \u00b1 \u221a(329)) / 20\n   ```\n   This gives us two possible solutions for *t*:\n   * t \u2248 -1.24 seconds\n   * t \u2248 -0.40 seconds\n5. **Interpret the results:** Since time cannot be negative, we discard the negative solutions.  This means the arrow will reach the target in approximately **0.40 seconds**. \n**Therefore, Billy must aim the arrow so that it reaches the target in approximately 0.40 seconds to hit the bullseye.** \n",
