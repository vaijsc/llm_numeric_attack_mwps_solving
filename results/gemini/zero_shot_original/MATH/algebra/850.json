    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Factoring the denominator $x^2 + 7x - 30$, we get \\[y = \\frac{x - 3}{x^2 + 7x - 30} = \\frac{x - 3}{(x-3)(x+10)}.\\]The graph has a vertical asymptote at $x = -10$.  There is no vertical asymptote at $x = 3$, because the factors of $x - 3$ in the numerator and denominator cancel.  Therefore, the graph has $\\boxed{1}$ vertical asymptote.",

        "Here's how to find the vertical asymptotes:\n**1. Factor the denominator:**\nThe denominator factors as  (x + 10)(x - 3).\n**2. Identify values that make the denominator zero:**\nThe denominator is zero when x = -10 or x = 3.\n**3. Check if these values also make the numerator zero:**\n* When x = -10, the numerator is -13. This is not zero.\n* When x = 3, the numerator is zero.\n**4. Determine vertical asymptotes:**\n*  Since x = -10 makes the denominator zero but not the numerator, there is a vertical asymptote at **x = -10**. \n*  Since x = 3 makes both the numerator and denominator zero, there is a hole in the graph at x = 3, not a vertical asymptote.\n**Answer:** The graph of the function has **one** vertical asymptote. \n",

Identify values that make the denominator zero:**\nThe denominator is zero when x = -10 or x = 3.\n**3. Check for cancellations with the numerator:**\nNotice that the numerator also has a factor of (x - 3). This means there's a hole in the graph at x = 3, not a vertical asymptote.\n**4. Conclusion:**\nSince the factor (x - 3) cancels out, we are left with only one value that makes the denominator zero: x = -10. This means there is **one** vertical asymptote at **x = -10**. \n",
