        "Here's how to find the value of x at the point of intersection:\n**1.  Solve for y in terms of x in the second equation:**\n   *  Subtract 3x from both sides of the equation 3x + y = 92:\n      *  y = -3x + 92\n**2.  Set the two expressions for y equal to each other:**\n   *  Since both equations represent the same y-value at the intersection point, we can set them equal:\n      *  2x - 13 = -3x + 92\n**3.  Solve for x:**\n   *  Add 3x to both sides: \n      *  5x - 13 = 92\n   *  Add 13 to both sides:\n      *  5x = 105\n   *  Divide both sides by 5:\n      *  x = 21\n**Therefore, the value of x at the point of intersection is 21.** \n",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Substitution**\n* Since we know y = 2x - 13, we can substitute this expression for 'y' in the second equation:\n   3x + (2x - 13) = 92\n**2. Simplify and Solve for x**\n* Combine like terms: 5x - 13 = 92\n* Add 13 to both sides: 5x = 105\n* Divide both sides by 5: x = 21\n**Therefore, the value of x at the point of intersection is 21.** \n",
