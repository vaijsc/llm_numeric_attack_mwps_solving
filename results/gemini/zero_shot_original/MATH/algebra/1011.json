    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We don't know the $y$-intercept, so let the $y$-intercept be $a$, where $1\\le a \\le 9$. Our line contains the points $(0,a)$ and $(4,365)$, so its slope is $\\frac{365-a}{4-0}=\\frac{365-a}{4}$. We are trying to find the smallest possible value of this expression, to minimize the slope. The denominator is fixed, so we must find the smallest possible value of the numerator, $365-a$. The smallest value will occur when $a$ is as large as possible, so $a=9$. Then the slope will be $\\frac{365-9}{4}=\\frac{356}{4}=\\boxed{89}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Problem**\nWe're given a point on the line (4, 365) and information about its y-intercept.  We need to find the smallest possible slope.\n**2. Visualize the Situation**\nImagine the point (4, 365) plotted on a graph.  The y-intercept can be anywhere between 1 and 9 on the y-axis.  To minimize the slope, we want the line to be as close to horizontal as possible.\n**3. Minimize the Slope**\nThe slope of a line is calculated as (change in y) / (change in x). To minimize the slope, we need to minimize the change in y (the vertical distance) while maximizing the change in x (the horizontal distance).\n* **Minimize the change in y:**  To minimize the change in y, the y-intercept should be as close as possible to 365.  Since the y-intercept is between 1 and 9, the smallest possible y-intercept is 1.\n* **Maximize the change in x:** The x-coordinate of the given point is 4. Since the y-intercept is on the y-axis (x=0), the change in x is 4 - 0 = 4.\n**4. Calculate the Minimum Slope**\nNow, we can calculate the minimum slope:\n* Change in y = 365 - 1 = 364\n* Change in x = 4 \n* Minimum Slope = 364 / 4 = **91**\n**Therefore, the minimum possible slope of the line is 91.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Problem**\nWe're given a point on the line (4, 365) and a range for the y-intercept. We need to find the minimum possible slope of the line.\n**2. Use the Slope-Intercept Form**\nThe slope-intercept form of a linear equation is: \n  * y = mx + b\n  where:\n    * m is the slope\n    * b is the y-intercept\n**3. Minimize the Slope**\nTo minimize the slope, we need to maximize the y-intercept.  This is because as the y-intercept increases, the line becomes less steep (a smaller slope).\n**4. Maximum y-intercept**\nThe maximum possible y-intercept is 9.\n**5. Find the Slope**\n* We know the point (4, 365) lies on the line.\n* We know the y-intercept (b) is 9.\n* Substitute these values into the slope-intercept form and solve for the slope (m):\n   365 = m * 4 + 9\n   356 = 4m\n   m = 89\n**Answer:** The minimum possible slope of the line is **89**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Understand the Concept of Slope**\n* Slope is a measure of how steep a line is. It's calculated as the change in y divided by the change in x (rise over run).\n* A positive slope means the line goes upwards from left to right.\n* A negative slope means the line goes downwards from left to right.\n* A steeper line has a larger absolute value of slope.\n**2. Visualize the Situation**\n* We know the line passes through the point (4, 365).\n* We also know the y-intercept is between 1 and 9. This means the line crosses the y-axis somewhere between those values.\n**3. Find the Minimum Slope**\nTo minimize the slope, we need to make the line as flat as possible.  This means we want the y-intercept to be as close to 365 as possible.\n* If the y-intercept is at 9, the line will be relatively flat (but still have a positive slope).\n*  The slope is the change in y over the change in x.  The change in y is 365 - 9 = 356, and the change in x is 4 (from the x-coordinate of the point to the x-intercept of 0).\n**4. Calculate the Minimum Slope**\nThe minimum slope is  (356 - 9)/4 = **86.75**. \n**Therefore, the minimum possible slope of the line is 86.75.** \n",

Visualize the Situation**\nImagine a coordinate plane. The point (4, 365) is high up on the y-axis.  The y-intercept could be anywhere from (0, 1) to (0, 9).\n**3. Slope Formula**\nRemember the slope formula: \n*  slope (m) = (change in y) / (change in x) \n**4. Minimize the Slope**\nTo minimize the slope, we need to:\n* **Maximize the change in x:** Since our line passes through (4, 365), the change in x will always be 4.\n* **Minimize the change in y:**  To minimize the change in y, we want the y-intercept to be as high as possible. The highest possible y-intercept is (0, 9).\n**5. Calculate the Minimum Slope**\n* Change in y = 365 - 9 = 356\n* Change in x = 4\n* Minimum slope = (356) / (4) = 89\n**Therefore, the minimum possible slope of the line is 89.** \n",
