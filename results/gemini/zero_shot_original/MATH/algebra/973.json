    "problem": "The length of a rectangle is four times its width. The perimeter is 100 cm. What is the number of square centimeters in the area of the rectangle?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let the length of the rectangle be $l$ and the width be $w$. We are trying to find the area of the rectangle, or $l \\cdot w$, so we need to first find both $l$ and $w$. We can set up the following system of equations to represent the given information:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nl &= 4w \\\\\n2l + 2w &= 100 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe will first solve for $w$ by eliminating $l$ from the equations above. Substituting the first equation into the second to eliminate $l$, we get $2(4w)+2w=100$ or $w=10$. Plugging this value into the first equation gives $l=4(10)=40$. Thus, the area of the rectangle is $l \\cdot w = 40 \\cdot 10 = \\boxed{400}$ square centimeters.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Define variables:**\n* Let 'w' represent the width of the rectangle.\n* Let 'l' represent the length of the rectangle.\n**2. Set up equations based on the given information:**\n*  \"The length of a rectangle is four times its width\":  l = 4w\n*  \"The perimeter is 100 cm\": 2l + 2w = 100\n**3. Solve for the width (w):**\n* Substitute '4w' for 'l' in the perimeter equation: 2(4w) + 2w = 100\n* Simplify: 8w + 2w = 100\n* Combine like terms: 10w = 100\n* Divide both sides by 10: w = 10 cm\n**4. Solve for the length (l):**\n* Use the equation l = 4w and substitute the value of w: l = 4 * 10 cm\n* Calculate: l = 40 cm\n**5. Calculate the area:**\n* Area of a rectangle = length * width\n* Area = 40 cm * 10 cm\n* Area = 400 square centimeters\n**Answer:** The area of the rectangle is **400 square centimeters**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Define Variables:**\n* Let `w` represent the width of the rectangle.\n* Let `l` represent the length of the rectangle.\n**2. Set Up Equations:**\n* We know the length is four times the width:  `l = 4w`\n* We know the perimeter is 100 cm: `2l + 2w = 100`\n**3. Solve for Width:**\n* Substitute `4w` for `l` in the perimeter equation: `2(4w) + 2w = 100`\n* Simplify: `8w + 2w = 100`\n* Combine like terms: `10w = 100`\n* Divide both sides by 10: `w = 10 cm`\n**4. Solve for Length:**\n* Substitute `w = 10 cm` into the equation `l = 4w`: `l = 4(10 cm) = 40 cm`\n**5. Calculate the Area:**\n* The area of a rectangle is length times width: `Area = l * w`\n* Substitute the values: `Area = 40 cm * 10 cm = 400 cm\u00b2`\n**Answer:** The area of the rectangle is **400 square centimeters**. \n",
