    "solution": "Given that $(8,8)$ is on the graph of $y=\\frac 14f\\left(\\frac 12x\\right)$, we can substitute $8$ for both $x$ and $y$ in that equation to obtain $$8 = \\frac14f\\left(\\frac 12\\cdot 8\\right).$$We can rewrite this information as $$32 = f(4),$$which tells us that $(4,32)$ must be on the graph of $y=f(x)$. The sum of coordinates of this point is $\\boxed{36}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Transformations**\n* **Horizontal Compression:**  The term  $\\frac{1}{2}x$ inside the function $f$ compresses the graph horizontally by a factor of 2. This means if we know a point on the graph of  $y = \\frac{1}{4}f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}x\\right)$, we need to *double* the x-coordinate to find the corresponding point on the graph of  $y = f(x)$.\n* **Vertical Stretch:** The factor of $\\frac{1}{4}$ in front of the function $f$ stretches the graph vertically by a factor of $\\frac{1}{4}$. This means we need to *multiply* the y-coordinate of a point on the graph of  $y = \\frac{1}{4}f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}x\\right)$ by 4 to find the corresponding point on the graph of $y = f(x)$.\n**2. Apply the Transformations**\nWe are given the point (8, 8) on the graph of $y = \\frac{1}{4}f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}x\\right)$.  Let's apply the transformations to find the corresponding point on the graph of $y = f(x)$:\n* **Double the x-coordinate:** 8 * 2 = 16\n* **Multiply the y-coordinate by 4:** 8 * 4 = 32\nThis tells us that the point **(16, 32)** must lie on the graph of  $y = f(x)$.\n**3. Calculate the Sum of Coordinates**\nThe sum of the coordinates of the point (16, 32) is 16 + 32 = **48**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Transformations**\nThe equation  *y = (1/4)f((1/2)x)* represents a series of transformations applied to the original function *y = f(x)*:\n* **Horizontal Stretch:** The term (1/2)x inside the function *f* stretches the graph horizontally by a factor of 2.\n* **Vertical Compression:** The factor (1/4) outside the function compresses the graph vertically by a factor of 4.\n**2. Reverse the Transformations**\nTo find the point on the original graph *y = f(x)*, we need to reverse these transformations.  \n* **Reverse Vertical Compression:**  Since the y-coordinate of the point (8,8) was compressed by a factor of 4, multiply the y-coordinate by 4: (8, 8*4) = (8, 32).\n* **Reverse Horizontal Stretch:** Since the x-coordinate of the point was stretched by a factor of 2, divide the x-coordinate by 2: (8/2, 32) = (4, 32).\n**3. The Corresponding Point**\nTherefore, the point (4, 32) must be on the graph of *y = f(x)*.\n**4. The Sum of Coordinates**\nThe sum of the coordinates of the point (4, 32) is 4 + 32 = **36**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Transformations**\n* **Horizontal Compression:** The term  `1/2x` inside the function `f` compresses the graph horizontally by a factor of 2.
