        "Here's how to find the domain and its width:\n**1.  Understanding Square Roots**\n* Square roots are only defined for non-negative numbers. So, we need to make sure the expressions inside both square roots are greater than or equal to zero.\n**2.  First Square Root:**\n*  We need  $25 - x^2 \\ge 0$.\n*  Factoring, we get $(5+x)(5-x) \\ge 0$.\n*  This inequality holds when both factors are non-negative or both are non-positive.  This gives us:\n    *  $x \\le -5$  or  $x \\ge 5$\n**3. Second Square Root:**\n* We need  $-(x-2) \\ge 0$.\n*  This simplifies to $x \\le 2$.\n**4.  Combining the Restrictions:**\n* We need to satisfy both restrictions from steps 2 and 3.  The only values that satisfy both inequalities are  $x \\le 2$.\n**5. Domain**\n* The domain of the function is  $x \\in (-\\infty, 2]$.\n**6. Width of the Interval**\n* The interval $(-\\infty, 2]$ is infinitely wide.\n**Answer:** The domain of the function $h(x)$ is an interval of **infinite** width. \n",
        "Here's how to determine the domain and its width:\n**1. Understand the Restrictions**\n* **Square Roots:** The expression inside a square root must be non-negative.\n* **Real Numbers:**  We're dealing with real numbers, so we can't have negative values under a square root.\n**2. Analyze the First Square Root**\n*  We need  $25 - x^2 \\ge 0$. \n*  Factor:  $(5+x)(5-x) \\ge 0$. \n*  Find the critical points:  x = -5 and x = 5.\n*  Test intervals:\n    *  x < -5: Both factors are negative, so the product is positive. \n    *  -5 \u2264 x \u2264 5: One factor is positive, the other negative, so the product is negative.\n    *  x > 5: Both factors are positive, so the product is positive.\n*  Therefore, the first square root is defined for  -5 \u2264 x \u2264 5.\n**3. Analyze the Second Square Root**\n*  We need  -(x-2) \u2265 0. \n*  Simplify:  -x + 2 \u2265 0\n*  Solve for x:  x \u2264 2\n**4. Combine the Restrictions**\nThe function is defined only where *both* square root conditions hold.  This means: \n*  -5 \u2264 x \u2264 5   *and*  x \u2264 2\nCombining these, the domain is -5 \u2264 x \u2264 2.\n**5. Calculate the Width**\nThe width of this interval is the difference between the endpoints: 2 - (-5) = **7**.\n**Therefore, the domain of the function is an interval of width 7.** \n",
        "Here's how to find the domain and its width:\n**1. Restrictions on Square Roots**\n* **Square Root 1:  \u221a(25 - x\u00b2)** \n   * The expression inside the square root must be non-negative: 25 - x\u00b2 \u2265 0\n   * Factoring: (5 + x)(5 - x) \u2265 0\n   * This inequality holds when x is in the interval [-5, 5].\n* **Square Root 2: \u221a(-(x - 2))** \n   * The expression inside the square root must be non-negative: -(x - 2) \u2265 0\n   * Simplifying: 2 - x \u2265 0\n   * Solving for x: x \u2264 2\n**2. Combining Restrictions**\nThe domain of the function h(x) is the intersection of the two intervals we found:\n*  x is in [-5, 5]  *and* x is in (-\u221e, 2]\nThis means the domain is: **[-5, 2]**\n**3. Finding the Width**\nThe width of the interval [-5, 2] is simply the difference between the endpoints:\n* Width = 2 - (-5) = **7** \n**Therefore, the domain of the function h(x) is an interval of width 7.** \n",
        "Here's how to find the domain and its width:\n**1. Understand Square Root Restrictions**\n* **Non-negative radicands:** The square root of a negative number is not a real number. Therefore, the expressions under the square roots must be greater than or equal to zero.\n**2. Set Up Inequalities**\n* **First square root:**  \n   We need  25 - x\u00b2 \u2265 0.  \n   Factor the left side: (5 + x)(5 - x) \u2265 0.\n   This inequality holds true when x \u2264 -5 or x \u2265 5.\n* **Second square root:**\n   We need -(x - 2) \u2265 0.\n   Simplify: -x + 2 \u2265 0.\n   Solve for x: x \u2264 2.\n**3. Combine the Restrictions**\n* We need *both* inequalities to be true simultaneously.  The solution is the intersection of the solution sets: \n   *  x \u2264 -5  \n   *  x \u2264 2 \n* The combined solution is x \u2264 -5.\n**4. Determine the Interval and Width**\n* The domain is  (-\u221e, -5]. \n* The width of this interval is **infinite**, as it extends infinitely to the left. \n**Therefore, the domain of the function h(x) is an interval of infinite width.** \n",
