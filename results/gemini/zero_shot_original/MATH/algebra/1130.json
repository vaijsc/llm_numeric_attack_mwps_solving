        "Here's how to find the fraction that equals  0.726:\n**1. Set up an equation:**\nLet  *x* equal the decimal: \n   *x* = 0.726666...\n**2. Multiply to shift the repeating block:**\nMultiply both sides of the equation by 100 to shift the decimal two places to the right: \n   100*x* = 72.6666...\n**3. Multiply to align the repeating block:**\nMultiply both sides of the equation by 1000 to shift the decimal three places to the right:\n   1000*x* = 726.6666...\n**4. Subtract the equations:**\nSubtract the equation from step 2 from the equation in step 3:\n   1000*x* = 726.6666...\n   - 100*x* =  72.6666...\n   ------------------\n   900*x* = 654\n**5. Solve for x:**\nDivide both sides by 900:\n   *x* = 654/900\n**6. Simplify the fraction:**\nSimplify by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, 18:\n   *x* = **36/50**\n**Therefore, 0.726 is equal to the fraction 36/50.** \n",
