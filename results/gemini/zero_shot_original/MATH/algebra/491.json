        "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Logarithm:**\n* The expression  $\\log_{\\sqrt[3]{5}} 125$ asks: \"To what power must we raise  $\\sqrt[3]{5}$ to get 125?\"\n**2. Simplify the Base:**\n*  $\\sqrt[3]{5}$ is the same as $5^{1/3}$\n**3. Express 125 in terms of the Base:**\n* 125 is the same as $5^3$ \n**4. Substitute and Solve:**\n* We now have:  $\\log_{5^{1/3}} 5^3$\n* Since the base and the argument are both powers of 5, we can use the property that  $\\log_{a^m} a^n = \\frac{n}{m}$\n* Applying this property, we get: $\\frac{3}{1/3} = 3 \\times 3 = \\boxed{9}$ \n",
        "Let $x = \\log_{\\sqrt[3]{5}}125$.  This means $(\\sqrt[3]{5})^x = 125$.  Since $125 = 5^3$ and $\\sqrt[3]{5} = 5^{1/3}$, we can rewrite the equation as\n\\[5^{x/3} = 5^3.\\]Then $x/3 = 3$, so $x = \\boxed{9}$.",
        "Let $x = \\log_{\\sqrt[3]{5}}125$.  Then $(\\sqrt[3]{5})^x = 125$.  Since $125 = 5^3 = (\\sqrt[3]{5})^9$, $x = \\boxed{9}$. \n",
        "Let's break this down:\n**Understanding Logarithms**\n* **Logarithms are the inverse of exponentiation.**  This means:  If  $a^b = c$, then $\\log_a c = b$.\n* **The base of the logarithm** is the number that is raised to a power (in our case, $\\sqrt[3]{5}$). \n**Solving the Problem**\n1. **Rewrite 125 as a power of the base:**  We know that $5^3 = 125$.  Since $\\sqrt[3]{5} = 5^{1/3}$, we can rewrite 125 as  $(\\sqrt[3]{5})^9$ (because $(5^{1/3})^9 = 5^3 = 125$).\n2. **Apply the logarithm definition:**  Now we have  $\\log_{\\sqrt[3]{5}} 125 = \\log_{\\sqrt[3]{5}} (\\sqrt[3]{5})^9$.  Since the logarithm asks \"what power do I raise the base to in order to get the result\", the answer is simply **9**.\n**Therefore,  $\\log_{\\sqrt[3]{5}}125 = 9$.** \n",
