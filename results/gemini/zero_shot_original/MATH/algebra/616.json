        "Here's how to solve the equation step-by-step:\n1. **Cross-multiply:** Multiply both sides of the equation by the denominators to get rid of the fractions:\n   ```\n   (66 - 2^x)(2^(x+1) + 6) = (4 - 2^x)(2^x + 3)\n   ```\n2. **Expand the products:** Use the distributive property to expand both sides of the equation:\n   ```\n   132 * 2^x + 396 - 2^(2x+1) - 6 * 2^x = 8 + 12 - 2^(2x) - 3 * 2^x\n   ```\n3. **Simplify:** Combine like terms on both sides:\n   ```\n   126 * 2^x + 396 - 2^(2x+1) = 20 - 2^(2x) - 3 * 2^x \n   ```\n4. **Rearrange:** Move all terms involving $2^x$ and $2^{2x}$ to one side and constants to the other side:\n   ```\n   129 * 2^x + 2^(2x) - 2^(2x+1) = -376\n   ```\n5. **Factor out 2^x:** Notice that all terms have a common factor of $2^x$. Factor it out:\n   ```\n   2^x (129 + 2^x - 2^(x+1)) = -376\n   ```\n6. **Simplify further:**  Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:\n   ```\n   2^x (129 - 2^x) = -376\n   ```\n7. **Let y = 2^x:** Substitute $y = 2^x$ to make the equation easier to work with:\n   ```\n   y(129 - y) = -376\n   ```\n8. **Solve the quadratic:** Expand and rearrange the equation to get a quadratic equation:\n   ```\n   y^2 - 129y - 376 = 0\n   ```\n9. **Factor the quadratic:** Factor the quadratic equation:\n   ```\n   (y - 136)(y + 2.77) = 0\n   ```\n10. **Solve for y:** This gives us two possible solutions for *y*:\n   ```\n   y = 136  or  y = -2.77\n   ```\n11. **Substitute back for x:** Recall that $y = 2^x$. Substitute back to find the solutions for *x*:\n   ```\n   2^x = 136  or  2^x = -2.77\n   ```\n12. **Solve for x:**  \n    * The equation $2^x = 136$ has a solution. To find it, you'll need to use logarithms: \n        *  $x = \\log_2(136)$ \n    * The equation $2^x = -2.77$ has no real solutions because an exponential function with a base of 2 will always produce a positive value.\n**Therefore, the solution to the equation is x = log\u2082(136).** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the equation step-by-step:\n1. **Simplify the equation:**\n   - Notice that the denominator of the right side can be factored: \n      $2^{x+1} + 6 = 2 \\cdot 2^x + 6 = 2(2^x + 3)$\n   - Now we can rewrite the equation as:\n      $$\\dfrac{66-2^x}{2^x+3}=\\dfrac{4-2^x}{2(2^x + 3)}$$\n2. **Multiply both sides by the common denominator:** \n   - The common denominator is $2(2^x + 3)$. Multiply both sides of the equation by this:\n     $$2(66-2^x) = 4-2^x$$\n3. **Simplify and solve for x:**\n   - Expand the left side:\n     $$132 - 2 \\cdot 2^x = 4 - 2^x$$\n   - Combine terms with $2^x$:\n     $$-2 \\cdot 2^x + 2^x = 4 - 132$$\n   - Simplify:\n     $$-2^x = -128$$\n   - Divide both sides by -1:\n     $$2^x = 128$$\n   - Recognize that 128 is a power of 2:\n     $$2^x = 2^7$$\n   - Since the bases are the same, the exponents must be equal:\n     $$x = \\boxed{7}$$ \n",
        "1. **Simplify the denominators:** \n   - The denominator on the right side can be rewritten: $2^{x+1} + 6 = 2\\cdot2^x + 6 = 2(2^x + 3)$.\n2. **Cross-multiply:**\n   - Multiply both sides of the equation by the denominators to get rid of the fractions:\n   \n   $(66-2^x)(2(2^x + 3)) = (4-2^x)(2^x + 3)$\n3. **Expand both sides:**\n   - Distribute on both sides: \n    \n    $132(2^x + 3) - 2(2^x)^2 - 6(2^x) = 4(2^x + 3) - (2^x)^2 - 3(2^x)$\n4. **Combine like terms:**\n   - Move all terms to one side and simplify:\n   \n   $(2^x)^2 + 11(2^x) - 120 = 0$\n5. **Factor the quadratic:**\n   - This equation looks like a quadratic equation where the variable is $2^x$.  Factor the quadratic:\n   \n   $(2^x + 15)(2^x - 8) = 0$\n6. **Solve for 2^x:**\n   - Set each factor equal to zero and solve for $2^x$:\n   \n   * $2^x + 15 = 0  \\Rightarrow 2^x = -15$  (This has no real solutions since $2^x$ is always positive)\n   * $2^x - 8 = 0  \\Rightarrow 2^x = 8$\n7. **Solve for x:**\n   -  Find the value of $x$ that satisfies $2^x = 8$. Since $8 = 2^3$, we have:\n   \n   $x = \\boxed{3}$ \n",
        "1. **Simplify the denominators:**\n   -  The denominator on the right side can be simplified:  \n      2^(x+1) + 6 = 2 * 2^x + 6 = 2(2^x + 3)\n2. **Multiply both sides by the least common multiple of the denominators:**\n   - The least common multiple of (2^x + 3) and 2(2^x + 3) is 2(2^x + 3). \n   - Multiplying both sides by 2(2^x + 3) gives:\n      2(66 - 2^x) = 4 - 2^x\n3. **Distribute and simplify:**\n   - Expand both sides:\n      132 - 2 * 2^x = 4 - 2^x\n   - Combine like terms:\n      128 = 2^x\n4. **Solve for x using logarithms:**\n   - Since 128 is a power of 2 (128 = 2^7), we can directly see that x = 7.\n   - Alternatively, we can take the logarithm base 2 of both sides:\n      log\u2082(128) = log\u2082(2^x)\n      7 = x\n**Therefore, the solution is x = 7.** \n",
