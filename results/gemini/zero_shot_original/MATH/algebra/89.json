        "Here's how to find the smallest value of the expression step-by-step:\n**1. Completing the Square**\n* **Rewrite the expression:**  The first two terms of the expression,  *x*\u00b2 - 6*x*, remind us of the pattern (a - b)\u00b2 = a\u00b2 - 2ab + b\u00b2.  To make our expression fit this pattern, we'll manipulate it: \n   *  x\u00b2 - 6x + 13 = (x\u00b2 - 6x + 9) + 13 - 9\n   * Notice that (x\u00b2 - 6x + 9) is a perfect square trinomial: (x - 3)\u00b2\n* **Simplify:** Now our expression becomes: (x - 3)\u00b2 + 4\n**2. Finding the Minimum Value**\n* **Understanding the Square:** The term (x - 3)\u00b2 is always greater than or equal to zero, regardless of the value of *x*. This is because squaring any number always results in a non-negative number.\n* **Finding the Minimum:** Since (x - 3)\u00b2 is always greater than or equal to zero, the smallest value of the entire expression occurs when (x - 3)\u00b2 = 0.  This happens when x = 3.\n**3. The Solution**\n* When x = 3, the expression becomes: (3 - 3)\u00b2 + 4 = 0 + 4 = 4\n**Therefore, the smallest value of the expression x\u00b2 - 6x + 13 is 4, which occurs when x = 3.** \n",
        "Here's how to find the smallest value of the expression step-by-step:\n**1. Completing the Square**\n* The expression $x^2 - 6x + 13$ is a quadratic. To find its minimum value, we'll use the technique of completing the square. \n* Take half of the coefficient of the $x$ term (-6), square it (9), and add and subtract it inside the expression:\n   \n   $x^2 - 6x + 13 = (x^2 - 6x + 9) + 13 - 9$\n* Now, the first three terms form a perfect square trinomial:\n   $(x^2 - 6x + 9) + 13 - 9 = (x-3)^2 + 4$\n**2. Understanding the Result**\n* We've rewritten the expression as $(x-3)^2 + 4$.  \n*  Since $(x-3)^2$ is always greater than or equal to zero (a square of a real number is always non-negative), the smallest possible value of the expression occurs when $(x-3)^2 = 0$. \n**3. Finding the Minimum Value**\n* When $(x-3)^2 = 0$,  $x = 3$.\n* Substituting $x = 3$ back into the expression, we get:\n    $(3-3)^2 + 4 = 4$\n**Therefore, the smallest value of the expression $x^2 - 6x + 13$ is 4, which occurs when x = 3.** \n",
        "Here's how to find the smallest value of the expression step-by-step:\n**1. Complete the Square**\n* **Take half of the coefficient of the x term, square it, and add it to both sides of the expression.**  The coefficient of the x term is -6, half of that is -3, and squaring it gives us 9. \n* **Rewrite the expression:**\n   \n   ```\n   x^2 - 6x + 13  = (x^2 - 6x + 9) + 13 - 9 \n   ```\n* **Factor the perfect square trinomial:**\n   ```\n   (x^2 - 6x + 9) + 13 - 9 = (x - 3)^2 + 4\n   ```\n**2. Analyze the Result**\n* **(x - 3)^2** is always greater than or equal to zero, since any number squared is non-negative.\n* **Adding 4 to a non-negative number** will always result in a value greater than or equal to 4.\n**3. Conclusion**\nThe smallest value of the expression occurs when (x - 3)^2 = 0. This happens when x = 3.  Therefore, the smallest value of the expression is 4. \n",
