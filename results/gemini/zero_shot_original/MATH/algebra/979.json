    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Call the amount of money Larry has $a$ and the amount of money Lenny has $b$. We can use the following system of equations to represent the given information: \\begin{align*}\na + b &= 35 \\\\\na &= \\frac{2}{5} \\cdot b \\\\\n\\end{align*} Substituting for $a$ into the first equation gives $\\frac{2}{5} b + b = 35$. Solving for $b$ gives $\\frac{7}{5} b = 35$, or $b = 25$. Thus, $a = 35 - 25 = 10$. So Lenny has $25 - 10 = \\boxed{15}$ more dollars than Larry.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Set up variables:**\n* Let 'L' represent the amount of money Larry has.\n* Let 'N' represent the amount of money Lenny has.\n**2. Translate the problem into equations:**\n* We know L + N = $35 (Together they have $35)\n* We also know L = (2/5)N (Larry has two-fifths of Lenny's amount)\n**3. Solve for N (Lenny's amount):**\n* Substitute the second equation (L = (2/5)N) into the first equation:\n   (2/5)N + N = $35\n* Combine like terms: \n   (7/5)N = $35\n* Multiply both sides by (5/7) to isolate N:\n   N = $35 * (5/7) = $25\n**4. Solve for L (Larry's amount):**\n* Use the equation L = (2/5)N and substitute N = $25:\n   L = (2/5) * $25 = $10\n**5. Find the difference:**\n* Subtract Larry's amount from Lenny's amount: \n   $25 - $10 = $15\n**Answer:** Lenny has $15 more than Larry. \n",
