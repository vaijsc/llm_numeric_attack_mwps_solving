    "problem": "When a car's brakes are applied, it travels 5 feet less in each  second than the previous second until it comes to a complete stop.  A car goes 45 feet in the first second after the brakes are applied.  How many feet does the car travel from the time the  brakes are applied to the time the car stops?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The number of feet the car travels in each second is an arithmetic sequence with first term 45 and common difference $-5$.  We are summing all the positive terms in this sequence (these terms represent the number of feet the car travels in each second). Thus, we want to find the sum $45+40+\\dots+5$.\n\nThe sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms.  The number of terms is $45/5 = 9$, so the sum is $(45 + 5)/2 \\cdot 9 = \\boxed{225}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Understand the Pattern:**\n* The car travels 5 feet less each second. This creates an arithmetic sequence.\n**2.  Identify the First Term and Common Difference:**\n* The first term (distance in the first second) is 45 feet.\n* The common difference is -5 feet (since the distance decreases by 5 feet each second).\n**3.  Find the Number of Terms:**\n* We need to find how many seconds it takes the car to stop.  To do this, let's figure out how many times we can subtract 5 from 45 before reaching zero:\n   * 45 - 5 = 40\n   * 40 - 5 = 35\n   * ... and so on \n* You'll find that we can subtract 5 a total of 9 times before reaching zero. This means the car stops in 9 seconds. \n**4.  Use the Arithmetic Series Formula:**\n* The sum (S) of an arithmetic series is: S = (n/2)(a + l)\n    * Where:\n        * n = number of terms (9 seconds in this case)\n        * a = first term (45 feet)\n        * l = last term (0 feet since the car stops)\n* Plugging in the values: S = (9/2)(45 + 0) = (9/2)(45) = 202.5 feet\n**Answer:** The car travels a total of **202.5 feet** from the time the brakes are applied until it stops. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Understand the Pattern:**\n* The car travels 5 feet less each second. This creates an arithmetic sequence where the first term is 45 feet and the common difference is -5 feet.\n**2.  Find the Number of Seconds:**\n* We need to figure out how many seconds it takes for the car to stop.  This means we want to find the term in the sequence that equals 0 (when the car is stopped).\n**3.  Use the Arithmetic Sequence Formula:**\n* The formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is: \n   *  a<sub>n</sub> = a<sub>1</sub> + (n - 1)d\n   * where a<sub>n</sub> is the nth term, a<sub>1</sub> is the first term, n is the number of terms, and d is the common difference.\n* We know:\n    * a<sub>1</sub> = 45 feet\n    * d = -5 feet\n    * a<sub>n</sub> = 0 (the car is stopped)\n* Substitute these values into the formula and solve for n:\n   * 0 = 45 + (n - 1)(-5)\n   * 0 = 45 - 5n + 5\n   * 5n = 50\n   * n = 10 \n**4.  Calculate the Total Distance:**\n* The car travels for 10 seconds. We need to find the sum of the distances traveled in each of those seconds. \n* The sum of an arithmetic series is given by:\n    * S<sub>n</sub> = (n/2)(a<sub>1</sub> + a<sub>n</sub>)\n* Substitute the values:\n    * S<sub>10</sub> = (10/2)(45 + 0)\n    * S<sub>10</sub> = 5 * 45\n    * S<sub>10</sub> = 225\n**Answer:** The car travels a total of **225 feet** from the time the brakes are applied until it stops. \n",
