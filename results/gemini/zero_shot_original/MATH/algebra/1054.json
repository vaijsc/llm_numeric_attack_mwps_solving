        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Identify the Geometric Series Components**\n* **First term (a):**  4\n* **Common ratio (r):**  12/a / 4 = 3/a\n**2.  Formula for the Sum of an Infinite Geometric Series**\nThe sum (S) of an infinite geometric series is given by: \n  S = a / (1 - r) \n**3. Apply the Formula to Our Series**\nS = 4 / (1 - 3/a) = 4a / (a - 3)\n**4.  Perfect Square Condition**\nWe want S to be a perfect square.  This means 4a / (a - 3) must equal the square of an integer.\n**5.  Analyzing the Expression**\n* **Factor out a 4:**  4a / (a - 3) = 4 * (a / (a - 3))\n* **Rewrite the fraction:**  a / (a - 3) = 1 + 3 / (a - 3)\n**6.  Finding Possible Values of a**\nFor the entire expression to be a perfect square,  3 / (a - 3) must be an integer. This means (a - 3) must be a divisor of 3. \nThe divisors of 3 are: 1, 3, -1, -3.  \nSince we are looking for positive integer values of *a*, the possible values for (a - 3) are 1 and 3.  \n* If (a - 3) = 1, then a = 4\n* If (a - 3) = 3, then a = 6\n**7.  Testing the Values**\nLet's test both values:\n* **a = 4:** S = 4 * 4 / (4 - 3) = 16 (perfect square)\n* **a = 6:** S = 4 * 6 / (6 - 3) = 8 (not a perfect square)\n**8.  Smallest Possible Value of a**\nThe smallest possible value of *a* that makes the sum a perfect square is **a = 4**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Identify the common ratio:**\nThe common ratio (r) of a geometric series is found by dividing any term by the term before it.  In this case:\n*  r = (12/a) / 4 = 3/a \n**2. Determine the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series:**\nThe sum (S) of an infinite geometric series is given by:\n* S = a\u2081 / (1 - r)   where a\u2081 is the first term.\n**3. Apply the formula to our series:**\n* S = 4 / (1 - 3/a) \n* S = 4a / (a - 3)\n**4.  The sum is a perfect square:**\nWe want to find the smallest positive integer 'a' that makes S a perfect square.  Let's analyze the expression:\n* **Numerator:**  4a is always divisible by 4.\n* **Denominator:** (a - 3) needs to be a factor of 4a to make the entire fraction a perfect square.\n**5. Finding the smallest 'a':**\nTo minimize 'a', we want (a - 3) to be as small as possible. Let's try different values of (a - 3):\n* **If (a - 3) = 1:**  Then a = 4, and S = 16 (a perfect square).\n**6. Checking for smaller values:**\nIf (a - 3) is less than 1, 'a' would be less than 4.  However, this would make the denominator of the sum negative, and the series would not converge.\n**Therefore, the smallest possible value of 'a' for which the sum of the geometric series is a perfect square is a = 4.** \n",

Set the Sum Equal to a Perfect Square**\nWe want the sum (S) to be a perfect square. Let's represent the perfect square as k\u00b2, where k is an integer:\n* 4a / (a - 3) = k\u00b2\n**4. Simplify and Analyze the Equation**\n* 4a = k\u00b2(a - 3)\n* 4a = k\u00b2a - 3k\u00b2\n* 3k\u00b2 = (k\u00b2 - 4)a \n* a = 3k\u00b2 / (k\u00b2 - 4)\n**5.

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Identify the Geometric Series**\nThe given series is a geometric series because each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a constant ratio, which is $\\frac{3}{a}$.\n**2. Find the Formula for the Sum**\nThe sum of an infinite geometric series with first term $a_1$ and common ratio $r$ is given by:\n$$S = \\frac{a_1}{1-r}$$\nIn our case, $a_1 = 4$ and $r = \\frac{3}{a}$.

Let's try to manipulate the expression for $S$ to see if we can make it look like a squared quantity.\nNotice that if we add and subtract 12 to the numerator, we can factor the expression:\n$$S = \\frac{4a}{a-3} = \\frac{4a - 12 + 12}{a-3} = \\frac{4(a-3) + 12}{a-3} = 4 + \\frac{12}{a-3}$$\nNow, to make this a perfect square, we need the fraction $\\frac{12}{a-3}$ to be a perfect square.

However, this would make the sum infinite, since the common ratio would be 1.\n* If $a - 3 = 2$, then $a = 5$. This leads to a sum of 16, which is a perfect square.\n**Answer**\nTherefore, the smallest possible value of $a$ where the sum is a perfect square is $\\boxed{5}$. \n"
