        "Here's how we can solve this problem:\n**Understanding the Problem**\n* We have two arithmetic sequences, let's call them Sequence 1 and Sequence 2.\n* The first term of Sequence 1 is 0.\n* The second term of Sequence 1 is found by adding the first term of Sequence 1 and the first term of Sequence 2.  This pattern continues for all subsequent terms of Sequence 1.\n* We know the fifth term of Sequence 2 is 3. \n* We want to find the fifth term of Sequence 1.\n**Solving the Problem**\n1. **Let's represent the common difference of Sequence 1 as 'd1' and the common difference of Sequence 2 as 'd2'.**\n2. **We know the first term of Sequence 1 is 0.**  \n3. **The second term of Sequence 1 is 0 + (first term of Sequence 2).**  \n4. **The third term of Sequence 1 is (0 + first term of Sequence 2) + (second term of Sequence 2).**\n5. **Notice a pattern:**  The nth term of Sequence 1 is the sum of the first (n-1) terms of Sequence 2.\n6. **Since the fifth term of Sequence 2 is 3, we know the sum of the first four terms of Sequence 2 is 3.** \n7. **Therefore, the fifth term of Sequence 1 is 3.**\n**Answer:** The fifth term of the first sequence is **3**. \n",
        "Let's break this down step by step:\n**Understanding the Pattern**\n* **First Sequence:** Let the common difference of the first sequence be 'd1'.  So the sequence is: 0, d1, 2d1, 3d1, 4d1, ...\n* **Second Sequence:** Let the first term of the second sequence be 'a' and its common difference be 'd2'. So the sequence is: a, a+d2, a+2d2, a+3d2, a+4d2, ...\n**Relating the Sequences**\nWe're told that the second term of the first sequence is the first term of the first sequence plus the first term of the second sequence. This means:\n* d1 = 0 + a  =>  d1 = a \nSimilarly, the third term of the first sequence is the second term of the first sequence plus the second term of the second sequence:\n* 2d1 = d1 + (a + d2)  =>  d1 = a + d2\n**Using the Given Information**\nWe know that the fifth term of the second sequence is 3:\n* a + 4d2 = 3\n**Solving for d1 (the common difference of the first sequence)**\n1. **Substitute:** Since we know d1 = a, we can substitute 'd1' for 'a' in the equation above: \n   d1 + 4d2 = 3\n2. **Combine equations:** We also know d1 = a + d2. Substituting this into the equation above gives us:\n   (a + d2) + 4d2 = 3\n3. **Simplify:** This simplifies to 5d2 = 3 - a\n4. **Solve for d2:**  We need to eliminate 'a' to find d2.  Notice that we know d1 = a.  Substituting again, we get:\n   5d2 = 3 - d1\n5. **Solve for d1:** Now, we have two equations with two unknowns:\n   * d1 = a + d2\n   * 5d2 = 3 - d1\n   Solving this system of equations, we find that d1 = 1.\n**Finding the Fifth Term of the First Sequence**\nThe fifth term of the first sequence is 4d1.  Since d1 = 1, the fifth term is 4 * 1 = **4**.\n**Therefore, the fifth term of the first sequence is 4.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.

Translate the given information into equations:**\n* We know  `a_1 = 0`.\n* We know  `a_2 = a_1 + b_1`.\n* We know  `a_3 = a_2 + b_2`.\n* We know  `b_5 = 3`.\n**3. Use the information to find the relationship between the sequences:**\nNotice that each term in the first sequence is the sum of the corresponding term in the second sequence and the previous term in the first sequence.  \n*  `a_2 = a_1 + b_1`\n*  `a_3 = a_2 + b_2`\n*  `a_4 = a_3 + b_3`\n*  `a_5 = a_4 + b_4`\n**4. Express the fifth term of the first sequence in terms of the terms of the second sequence:**\nSubstituting the first few equations into each other, we get:\n* `a_3 = (a_1 + b_1) + b_2 = a_1 + b_1 + b_2`\n* `a_4 = (a_1 + b_1 + b_2) + b_3 = a_1 + b_1 + b_2 + b_3`\n* `a_5 = (a_1 + b_1 + b_2 + b_3) + b_4 = a_1 + b_1 + b_2 + b_3 + b_4`\n**5. Use the given information about the fifth term of the second sequence:**\nSince `a_1 = 0` and `b_5 = 3`, we can substitute to find `a_5`:\n* `a_5 = 0 + b_1 + b_2 + b_3 + b_4`\n* `a_5 = b_1 + b_2 + b_3 + b_4` \n**6. The problem doesn't give us enough information to find the exact value of  `a_5`.**\nWe only know the fifth term of the second sequence.
