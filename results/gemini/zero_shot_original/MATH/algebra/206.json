        "Here's how to evaluate $(-125)^{4/3}$ step-by-step:\n**Understanding Fractional Exponents**\n* **The numerator of the exponent (4) indicates the power.** We'll raise the base (-125) to the 4th power.\n* **The denominator of the exponent (3) indicates the root.** We'll take the cube root of the result.\n**Calculation**\n1. **Cube root:**  Find the cube root of -125. Since -5 x -5 x -5 = -125, the cube root of -125 is -5.\n2. **Fourth power:** Raise the result (-5) to the fourth power: (-5)^4 = 625.\n**Therefore,  (-125)^(4/3) = 625** \n",
        "Here's how to evaluate $(-125)^{4/3}$ step-by-step:\n**Understanding Fractional Exponents**\n* **Fractional exponents represent roots and powers:** The numerator of the fraction indicates the power, and the denominator indicates the root. So,  (a)^(m/n) is the same as the nth root of a raised to the power of m:  \u221a[n](a^m).\n**Applying the Concepts**\n1. **Cube Root:** The denominator of our exponent is 3, so we need to find the cube root of -125.  The cube root of -125 is -5 because (-5) * (-5) * (-5) = -125.\n2. **Fourth Power:** The numerator of our exponent is 4, so we need to raise the result from step 1 (which is -5) to the power of 4: (-5)^4 = 625.\n**Therefore,  (-125)^(4/3) = 625** \n",
