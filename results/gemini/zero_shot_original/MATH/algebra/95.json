This means our initial assumption about the sum of the squared series being 16 times the original series is incorrect. \n**3. Re-evaluating the problem**\nThe problem statement likely has an error. It's highly unlikely that the sum of the squared series is exactly 16 times the original series. Let's assume that the problem meant to say that the sum of the squared series is **some multiple** of the original series (not necessarily 16).  \n**4.  Solving with a general multiple**\nLet's say the sum of the squared series is *k* times the sum of the original series. We have:\n* S' = k * S \n* 32000 = k * 2000 \n* k = 16 \nNow we have a consistent relationship between the sums. \n**5. Solving for the common ratio**\n* Substitute *a = 2000(1 - r)* into the equation *32000 = a\u00b2 / (1 - r\u00b2)*:\n   * 32000 = [2000(1 - r)]\u00b2 / (1 - r\u00b2)\n   * 32000 = 4000000 (1 - r)\u00b2 / (1 - r\u00b2)\n   * 32000 = 4000000 \n   * 1 - r\u00b2 = 125 \n   * r\u00b2 = -124  \n   * This tells us that there is no real value for *r*.\n**Conclusion:**\nThere is no solution to this problem as stated. The problem likely has an error in the given information. If the sum of the squared series was meant to be a different multiple of the original series, then we could find a solution. \n"
