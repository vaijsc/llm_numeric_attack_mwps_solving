        "Here's how to solve the equation step-by-step:\n**1. Express 49 as a power of 7:**\n*  Since 49 is the square of 7, we can write:  49 = 7\u00b2\n**2. Substitute into the equation:**\n*  Our equation now becomes: 7^(log_x 49) = 7\u00b2\n**3. Use the property of logarithms:**\n*  The equation tells us that the base-7 logarithm of 49 raised to the power of 7 equals 7\u00b2.  We can use the property:  a^(log_a b) = b \n*  Applying this property to our equation, we get: log_x 49 = 2\n**4. Convert to exponential form:**\n*  The logarithmic equation log_x 49 = 2 is equivalent to the exponential equation: x\u00b2 = 49\n**5. Solve for x:**\n* Taking the square root of both sides, we get: x = \u00b17\n**6. Consider the domain of logarithms:**\n* The base of a logarithm must be positive and not equal to 1.  Therefore, x cannot be -7.\n**Final Solution:**\n* The only solution to the equation is **x = 7**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the equation step-by-step:\n1. **Rewrite 49 in terms of 7:**  Since 49 is 7 squared, we can rewrite the equation as:\n   \n   $7^{\\log_x 49} = 7^2$\n2. **Equate exponents:**  When the bases are the same, we can equate the exponents:\n   $\\log_x 49 = 2$\n3. **Convert to exponential form:**  The logarithmic equation $\\log_x 49 = 2$ is equivalent to:\n   $x^2 = 49$\n4. **Solve for x:**  Take the square root of both sides:\n   $x = \\pm 7$\n5. **Check for validity:**  Remember that the base of a logarithm must be positive and not equal to 1. Therefore, the solution $x = -7$ is not valid.\n**Therefore, the only solution to the equation is x = 7.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the equation step-by-step:\n1. **Understand the Properties of Logarithms:**\n   * The equation $a^{\\log_a b} = b$  is a fundamental property of logarithms. \n   * This means the exponent and the base of the logarithm cancel each other out.\n2. **Apply the Property:**\n   * We can rewrite 49 as 7\u00b2:  \n      $7^{\\log_x 49} = 7^2$\n3. **Equate Exponents:**\n   * Since the bases are now the same, we can equate the exponents:\n      $\\log_x 49 = 2$\n4. **Convert to Exponential Form:**\n   * The logarithmic equation $\\log_x 49 = 2$  is equivalent to the exponential equation:\n      $x^2 = 49$\n5. **Solve for x:**\n   * Taking the square root of both sides, we get:\n      $x = \\pm 7$\n6. **Check for Validity:**\n   * **Important:** We need to check if both solutions are valid. Logarithms are only defined for positive bases and arguments. Since we have $\\log_x 49$ in the original equation,  we must discard the solution $x = -7$.\n**Therefore, the only valid solution is x = 7.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the equation step-by-step:\n1. **Rewrite 49 in terms of 7:**  Notice that  49 is the same as 7 squared (7\u00b2).
