    "solution": "A $y$-intercept is a point on the graph that lies on the $y$-axis, so $x = 0$.  Hence, the number $y$-intercepts corresponds to the number of real solutions of the quadratic equation $y^2 - 4y - 1 = 0$.  The discriminant of this quadratic equation is $(-4)^2 + 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (-1) = 20$, which is positive, so the quadratic has two distinct real roots.  Therefore, the number of $y$-intercepts is $\\boxed{2}$.\n\n[asy]\nsize(150);\nreal ticklen=3;\nreal tickspace=2;\n\nreal ticklength=0.1cm;\nreal axisarrowsize=0.14cm;\npen axispen=black+1.3bp;\nreal vectorarrowsize=0.2cm;\nreal tickdown=-0.5;\nreal tickdownlength=-0.15inch;\nreal tickdownbase=0.3;\nreal wholetickdown=tickdown;\nvoid rr_cartesian_axes(real xleft, real xright, real ybottom, real ytop, real xstep=1, real ystep=1, bool\n\nuseticks=false, bool complexplane=false, bool usegrid=true) {\n\nimport graph;\n\nreal i;\n\nif(complexplane) {\n\nlabel(\"$\\textnormal{Re}$\",(xright,0),SE);\n\nlabel(\"$\\textnormal{Im}$\",(0,ytop),NW);\n\n} else {\n\nlabel(\"$x$\",(xright+0.4,-0.5));\n\nlabel(\"$y$\",(-0.5,ytop+0.2));\n\n}\n\nylimits(ybottom,ytop);\n\nxlimits( xleft, xright);\n\nreal[] TicksArrx,TicksArry;\n\nfor(i=xleft+xstep; i<xright; i+=xstep) {\n\nif(abs(i) >0.1) {\n\nTicksArrx.push(i);\n\n}\n\n}\n\nfor(i=ybottom+ystep; i<ytop; i+=ystep) {\n\nif(abs(i) >0.1) {\n\nTicksArry.push(i);\n\n}\n\n}\n\nif(usegrid) {\n\nxaxis(BottomTop(extend=false), Ticks(\"%\", TicksArrx ,pTick=gray\n\n(0.22),extend=true),p=invisible);//,above=true);\n\nyaxis(LeftRight(extend=false),Ticks(\"%\", TicksArry ,pTick=gray(0.22),extend=true),\n\np=invisible);//,Arrows);\n\n}\n\nif(useticks) {\n\nxequals(0, ymin=ybottom, ymax=ytop, p=axispen, Ticks(\"%\",TicksArry ,\n\npTick=black+0.8bp,Size=ticklength), above=true, Arrows(size=axisarrowsize));\n\nyequals(0, xmin=xleft, xmax=xright, p=axispen, Ticks(\"%\",TicksArrx ,\n\npTick=black+0.8bp,Size=ticklength), above=true, Arrows(size=axisarrowsize));\n\n} else {\n\nxequals(0, ymin=ybottom, ymax=ytop, p=axispen, above=true, Arrows(size=axisarrowsize));\n\nyequals(0, xmin=xleft, xmax=xright, p=axispen, above=true, Arrows(size=axisarrowsize));\n\n}\n};\nreal lowerx, upperx, lowery, uppery;\nreal f(real x) {return x^2 - 4*x - 1;}\nlowery = -1;\nuppery = 5;\nrr_cartesian_axes(-6,5,lowery,uppery);\ndraw(reflect((0,0),(1,1))*(graph(f,lowery,uppery,operator ..)), red);\ndot((0,2 + sqrt(5)));\ndot((0,2 - sqrt(5)));\n[/asy]",

        "### Response:\nThe y-intercept of a graph is the point where the graph crosses the y-axis. This happens when *x* = 0.  Let's substitute *x* = 0 into the equation and solve for *y*:\n0 = *y*\u00b2 - 4*y* - 1\nThis is a quadratic equation.

Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get:\n*y* = [4 \u00b1 \u221a((-4)\u00b2 - 4 * 1 * -1)] / (2 * 1)\n*y* = [4 \u00b1 \u221a(20)] / 2\n*y* = [4 \u00b1 2\u221a5] / 2\n*y* = 2 \u00b1 \u221a5\nThis gives us two solutions for *y*: 2 + \u221a5 and 2 - \u221a5.  \nSince we have two distinct values of *y* when *x* = 0, the graph of the parabola intersects the y-axis at two points.\n**Therefore, the graph of the parabola *x* = *y*\u00b2 - 4*y* - 1 has two y-intercepts.** \n",
