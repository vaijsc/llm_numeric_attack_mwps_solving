        "Here's how to solve this step-by-step:\n1. **Calculate the base:**  $(2^3) = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 8$\n2. **Apply the exponent:**  $8^{\\frac{4}{3}}$  \n3. **Understanding fractional exponents:**  A fractional exponent like $\\frac{4}{3}$ represents both a root and a power. The denominator (3) indicates the root (cube root in this case), and the numerator (4) indicates the power.\n4. **Calculate the cube root:** $\\sqrt[3]{8} = 2$  (The cube root of 8 is 2 because 2 x 2 x 2 = 8)\n5. **Raise to the power:** $2^4 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 16$\n**Therefore, the value of $(2^3)^{\\frac{4}{3}}$ is 16.** \n",
