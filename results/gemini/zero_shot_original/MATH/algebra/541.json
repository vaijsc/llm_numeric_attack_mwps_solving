    "solution": "From the information given, we can construct the following equation: $xy + 1 = (x-4)(2y-1)$. This simplifies to $xy - x - 8y = -3$. We can then apply Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick and add $8$ to both sides to get $xy - x - 8y + 8 = 5$. This can be factored into $$(x-8)(y-1)=5$$Since $x\\leq 10$, $x=9$ and $y=6$. Thus, the product of my two numbers is $9 \\cdot 6 = \\boxed{54}$.",

        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Set up the equation:**\nWe know that the product of your friend's numbers is one greater than the product of your numbers.  This can be written as an equation:\n(x - 4)(2y - 1) = xy + 1\n**2. Expand the equation:**\nExpand the left side of the equation:\n2xy - x - 8y + 4 = xy + 1\n**3. Simplify the equation:**\nCombine like terms:\nxy - x - 8y + 3 = 0\n**4. Factor the equation:**\nNotice that the equation can be factored by grouping:\n(x - 8)(y - 1) = 0\n**5. Solve for possible values of x and y:**\nFor the product to be zero, either (x - 8) = 0 or (y - 1) = 0. This gives us two possibilities:\n* **Possibility 1:** x = 8 and y can be any number between 1 and 10.\n* **Possibility 2:** y = 1 and x can be any number between 1 and 10.\n**6. Check the conditions:**\nWe need to ensure that both your friend's numbers are between 1 and 10.  Let's check both possibilities:\n* **Possibility 1 (x = 8):** Your friend's numbers would be 4 and 15. This is not valid because 15 is outside the range of 1 to 10.\n* **Possibility 2 (y = 1):** Your friend's numbers would be x - 4 and 1.  This is valid, and x can be any number between 1 and 10.\n**7. Find the product of your numbers:**\nSince y = 1, the product of your numbers is simply x.  Since x can be any number between 1 and 10, there are multiple possible products.\n**Therefore, there is no single answer to the question. The product of your numbers could be any number from 1 to 10.** \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Set up the equation:**\nWe're given that the product of your friend's numbers is one greater than the product of your numbers.  Let's translate this into an equation:\n(x - 4)(2y - 1) = xy + 1\n**2. Expand the equation:**\nExpand the left side of the equation:\n2xy - x - 8y + 4 = xy + 1\n**3. Simplify the equation:**\nCombine like terms:\nxy - x - 8y + 3 = 0\n**4.  Factor the equation:**\nNotice that we can factor the equation by grouping:\n(x - 8)(y - 1) = 0\n**5. Find possible solutions:**\nFor the product of two factors to be zero, at least one of the factors must be zero.  This gives us two possibilities:\n* **Possibility 1:** x - 8 = 0  =>  x = 8\n* **Possibility 2:** y - 1 = 0  =>  y = 1\n**6. Check the solutions:**\nWe need to make sure that the solutions fit the original conditions of the problem.\n* **Possibility 1:** If x = 8, then x - 4 = 4.  This is a valid whole number between 1 and 10.\n* **Possibility 2:** If y = 1, then 2y - 1 = 1. This is also a valid whole number between 1 and 10.\n**7. Calculate the product:**\nSince both possibilities work, we have two potential answers:\n* **If x = 8 and y = 1:** The product of your numbers is xy = 8 * 1 = **8**\n* **If x = 8 and y = 1:** The product of your numbers is xy = 8 * 1 = **8** \n**Answer:** The product of your numbers is **8**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Set up the equations:**\n* You chose numbers *x* and *y*.\n* Your friend chose numbers *x - 4* and *2y - 1*.\n* The problem states that the product of your friend's numbers is one greater than the product of your numbers.  This translates to the equation: \n   (x - 4)(2y - 1) = xy + 1\n**2. Expand the equation:**\n*  Expand the left side of the equation: \n   2xy - x - 8y + 4 = xy + 1\n**3. Simplify the equation:**\n*  Subtract *xy* from both sides: \n   xy - x - 8y + 4 = 1\n*  Subtract 4 from both sides:\n   xy - x - 8y = -3\n**4. Factor by grouping:**\n*  Group the terms with *x* and *y*:\n   (xy - x) + (-8y + 8) = -3 + 8\n*  Factor out common factors: \n   x(y - 1) - 8(y - 1) = 5\n*  Factor out (y - 1):\n   (x - 8)(y - 1) = 5\n**5. Find possible values for x and y:**\n*  Since *x* and *y* are whole numbers between 1 and 10, we need to find factors of 5 that satisfy this condition. The only factors of 5 are 1 and 5. \n*  We have two possible scenarios:\n    * **Scenario 1:** x - 8 = 1 and y - 1 = 5, which means x = 9 and y = 6.\n    * **Scenario 2:** x - 8 = 5 and y - 1 = 1, which means x = 13 and y = 2.\n**6. Eliminate the invalid solution:**\n*  Since *x* must be between 1 and 10, the second scenario (x = 13) is not valid.\n**7. Calculate the product of your numbers:**\n*  The valid solution is x = 9 and y = 6.\n*  The product of your numbers is x * y = 9 * 6 = **54**\n**Therefore, the product of your numbers is 54.** \n",

Factor:**\n* Notice that the left side of the equation can be factored: (x - 8)(y - 1) = -3\n**4. Find possible values:**\n* Since *x* and *y* are whole numbers between 1 and 10, we need to find pairs of factors of -3 that satisfy this condition.  The factors of -3 are (1, -3) and (-1, 3). \n**5.  Solve for x and y:**\n* **Case 1:**  (x - 8) = 1 and (y - 1) = -3 \n   This gives us x = 9 and y = -2, but *y* must be between 1 and 10, so this case is not valid.\n* **Case 2:** (x - 8) = -1 and (y - 1) = 3\n    This gives us x = 7 and y = 4, which satisfies the conditions of the problem.\n**6. Calculate the product:**\n* The product of your numbers, *x* and *y*, is 7 * 4 = **28**. \n**Therefore, the product of your numbers is 28.** \n",
