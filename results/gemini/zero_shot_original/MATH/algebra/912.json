    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Rearranging the second equation, we have that $b^3=\\frac{4}{27}a$. If we substitute this into the original equation, we get $\\frac{4}{27}a^3=\\frac{32}{27}$; after multiplying each side by $\\frac{27}{4}$ and taking the cube root, we see that $a=2$. Substituting $a$ into the first equation, we get that $b^3=\\frac{8}{27}$ or $b=\\frac23$. Thus, $a+b=2+\\frac23=\\boxed{\\frac83}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Express the second equation in terms of  a^2b^3:**\n* Multiply both sides of the second equation by  b^6:\n   (a/b^3) * b^6 = (27/4) * b^6\n* Simplify: a * b^3 = (27/4) * b^6\n* Square both sides: (a * b^3)^2 = (27/4)^2 * b^12\n* Simplify: a^2 * b^6 = (729/16) * b^12\n**2.  Notice that a^2b^6 is present in both equations:**\n* We know a^2b^3 = 32/27\n* We also know a^2b^6 = (729/16) * b^12\n**3. Substitute and solve for b:**\n* Since a^2b^6 = (a^2b^3) * b^3, we can substitute: \n    (32/27) * b^3 = (729/16) * b^12\n* Simplify: 32/27 = (729/16) * b^9\n* Solve for b^9: b^9 = (32/27) * (16/729) = 64/729\n* Take the cube root of both sides: b^3 = 4/9\n**4. Substitute to find a:**\n* We know a/b^3 = 27/4\n* Substitute b^3 = 4/9: a/(4/9) = 27/4\n* Simplify: a = (27/4) * (4/9) = 3\n**5. Calculate a + b:**\n* We know a = 3 and b^3 = 4/9\n* Find b: b = (4/9)^(1/3) = 2/3\n* Calculate a + b: 3 + 2/3 = 11/3\n**Therefore, a + b = 11/3** \n",
