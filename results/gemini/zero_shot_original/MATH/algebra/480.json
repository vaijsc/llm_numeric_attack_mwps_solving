        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n1. **Simplify the given equation:**\n   Start with the given equation:  \n   ```\n   1/p + 1/q = 1 \n   ```\n   Multiply both sides by *pq* to get rid of the fractions:\n   ```\n   q + p = pq \n   ```\n2. **Rearrange to get the desired product:**\n   Subtract *pq* from both sides and add 1 to both sides:\n   ```\n   1 = pq - p - q + 1\n   ```\n   Notice the right side now factors nicely:\n   ```\n   1 = (p - 1)(q - 1)\n   ```\n3. **The answer:**\n   Therefore,  **(p - 1)(q - 1) = 1** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Simplify the given equation:**\nStart with the equation  $\\frac{1}{p} + \\frac{1}{q} = 1$.  To combine the fractions, find a common denominator:\n*  $\\frac{q}{pq} + \\frac{p}{pq} = 1$\n*  $\\frac{p + q}{pq} = 1$\n**2. Solve for pq:**\nMultiply both sides of the equation by *pq*:\n*  $p + q = pq$\n**3. Manipulate the expression (p-1)(q-1):**\nExpand the expression:\n* $(p-1)(q-1) = pq - p - q + 1$\n**4. Substitute the value of pq:**\nSince we know that $pq = p + q$, we can substitute:\n* $(p-1)(q-1) = (p + q) - p - q + 1$\n**5. Simplify:**\nThe terms *p* and *q* cancel out:\n* $(p-1)(q-1) = \\boxed{1}$\n**Therefore, the value of (p-1)(q-1) is always 1, regardless of the specific values of p and q (as long as they satisfy the original condition).** \n",
