    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Adding the first given equation to the second, we have $a+2b+c=5$. Then, subtracting the third given equation from this last equation, we get $2b=10$, so $b=5$. Plugging this value of $b$ into the first given equation, we find that $a=3$. Plugging this value of $a$ into the third given equation, we find that $c=-8$. Thus, the product $abc=3\\cdot5\\cdot-8=\\boxed{-120}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Isolate Variables:**\n   * Add the first two equations together: \n      (a + b) + (b + c) = 8 + (-3) \n      a + 2b + c = 5\n   * Add the first and third equations together:\n      (a + b) + (a + c) = 8 + (-5)\n      2a + b + c = 3\n**2.  Solve for a and b:**\n   * Subtract the equation from step 1 from the equation in step 2:\n      (2a + b + c) - (a + 2b + c) = 3 - 5\n      a - b = -2\n   * Add this new equation to the first given equation:\n      (a - b) + (a + b) = -2 + 8\n      2a = 6\n      a = 3\n   * Substitute the value of a (3) back into the equation a - b = -2:\n      3 - b = -2\n      b = 5\n**3.  Solve for c:**\n   * Substitute the values of a (3) and b (5) into any of the original equations. Let's use the first equation:\n      3 + 5 = 8 \n**4.  Calculate the product abc:**\n   * Now that you know a = 3, b = 5, and c = 0, calculate the product:\n      abc = (3)(5)(0) = 0\n**Therefore, the value of the product abc is 0.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Add all three equations together:**\n   (a + b) + (b + c) + (a + c) = 8 + (-3) + (-5)\n   This simplifies to: 2a + 2b + 2c = 0\n**2. Divide both sides by 2:**\n   a + b + c = 0\n**3. Isolate 'c':**\n   c = -a - b\n**4. Substitute the value of 'c' into the equation 'a + c = -5':**\n   a + (-a - b) = -5\n   This simplifies to: -b = -5\n   Therefore, b = 5\n**5. Substitute the value of 'b' into the equation 'a + b = 8':**\n   a + 5 = 8\n   Therefore, a = 3\n**6. Substitute the values of 'a' and 'b' into the equation 'c = -a - b':**\n   c = -3 - 5\n   Therefore, c = -8\n**7. Calculate the product abc:**\n   abc = (3)(5)(-8) = -120\n**Therefore, the value of the product abc is -120.** \n",
