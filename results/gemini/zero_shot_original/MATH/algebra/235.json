        "**1. Find the common ratio:**\n* The sequence is geometric, meaning each term is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant.\n* To find this constant (the common ratio), divide any term by the term before it. \n* Let's use the first two terms: 81 / 243 = 1/3. \n**2.  Determine the missing terms:**\n*  The common ratio is 1/3.\n*  To find *x*, multiply 81 by 1/3: 81 * (1/3) = 27. \n*  To find *y*, multiply 27 by 1/3: 27 * (1/3) = 9.\n**3. Calculate x + y:**\n* x + y = 27 + 9 = 36\n**Therefore, the value of x + y is 36.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n1. **Find the common ratio:**  Notice that 81 is obtained by dividing 243 by 3.  This means the common ratio of the geometric sequence is 1/3.\n2. **Find x:**  To get to the next term (x), we multiply 81 by 1/3:  81 * (1/3) = 27.  So, x = 27.\n3. **Find y:** To get to the next term (y), we multiply 27 by 1/3: 27 * (1/3) = 9.  So, y = 9.\n4. **Calculate x + y:**  x + y = 27 + 9 = 36\n**Therefore, the value of x + y is 36.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n1. **Find the common ratio:**  Notice that each term is one-third of the previous term.
