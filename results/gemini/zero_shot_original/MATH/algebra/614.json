        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Express both sides with the same base:**\n*  We know that  $\\frac{1}{8} = 2^{-3}$. \n**2. Substitute and simplify:**\n*  The equation becomes:  $2^{12} = (2^{-3})^x$\n*  Using the rule of exponents  $(a^m)^n = a^{m \\cdot n}$, we get:  $2^{12} = 2^{-3x}$\n**3. Equate exponents:**\n* Since the bases are now the same, we can equate the exponents:  $12 = -3x$\n**4. Solve for x:**\n* Divide both sides by -3:  $x = \\boxed{-4}$ \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Express everything in terms of the same base:**\n*  Notice that  8 is a power of 2:  8 = 2\u00b3.\n*  Therefore,  1/8  can be written as  2\u207b\u00b3.\n**2. Substitute the equivalent expressions:**\n* The equation becomes:  2\u00b9\u00b2 = (2\u207b\u00b3)^x\n**3. Simplify using exponent rules:**\n*  When raising a power to another power, we multiply the exponents: (a^m)^n = a^(m*n).\n*  So, the equation becomes: 2\u00b9\u00b2 = 2^(-3x)\n**4. Solve for x:**\n*  For the bases to be equal, the exponents must also be equal.\n*  This gives us: 12 = -3x\n*  Solving for x:  x = 12 / -3 = **-4**\n**Therefore, the value of x that satisfies the equation is -4.** \n",
