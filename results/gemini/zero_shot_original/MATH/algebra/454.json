        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Simplify the expression:**\n* Notice that the expression  $\\frac{a}{b}+\\frac{b}{a}-ab$ can be rewritten as: \n   \n   $$\\frac{a^2 + b^2 - a^2 b^2}{ab}$$\n**2. Utilize the given equation:**\n* We're given that  $ab = a - b$.  Let's substitute this into the simplified expression:\n   $$\\frac{a^2 + b^2 - a^2 b^2}{ab} = \\frac{a^2 + b^2 - (a-b)^2}{a-b}$$\n**3. Expand and simplify further:**\n* Expanding the square in the numerator:\n   $$\\frac{a^2 + b^2 - (a^2 - 2ab + b^2)}{a-b} = \\frac{2ab}{a-b}$$\n**4. Use the given equation again:**\n*  Substitute $ab = a - b$ one more time:\n   $$\\frac{2ab}{a-b} = \\frac{2(a-b)}{a-b} = 2$$\n**5. Conclusion:**\n* We've shown that the expression $\\frac{a}{b}+\\frac{b}{a}-ab$ always equals 2, regardless of the values of  *a* and *b* (as long as they satisfy the given condition).  \n**Therefore, the smallest possible value is 2.** \n",

Substitute into the expression to minimize:**\nNow, let's substitute this expression for $b$ into the expression we want to minimize:\n  * $\\frac{a}{b} + \\frac{b}{a} - ab = \\frac{a}{\\frac{a}{a + 1}} + \\frac{\\frac{a}{a + 1}}{a} - a \\cdot \\frac{a}{a + 1}$\n  * $= a + 1 + \\frac{1}{a + 1} - \\frac{a^2}{a + 1}$\n  * $= \\frac{a^2 + 2a + 1 + 1 - a^2}{a + 1}$\n  * $= \\frac{2a + 2}{a + 1}$\n**3.

Let's rearrange this equation to get: \n  \n  *  $ab + b = a$\n  *  $b(a + 1) = a$\n**2. Express the expression we want to minimize in terms of 'a' and 'b':**\nLet's simplify the expression we want to minimize:\n  *  $\\frac{a}{b}+\\frac{b}{a}-ab = \\frac{a^2 + b^2}{ab} - ab$\n**3. Substitute using the rearranged equation:**\nSince we know  $b(a + 1) = a$, we can solve for 'b':\n  *  $b = \\frac{a}{a + 1}$\nSubstitute this value of 'b' into our expression:\n  *  $\\frac{a^2 + b^2}{ab} - ab = \\frac{a^2 + (\\frac{a}{a + 1})^2}{a \\cdot \\frac{a}{a + 1}} - a \\cdot \\frac{a}{a + 1}$\n**4.

Analyze the simplified expression:**\nNow we have the expression in terms of 'a' only.  To find the smallest possible value, let's analyze the expression:\n  *  $\\frac{a^2 + a + 2}{a + 1} = a + \\frac{2}{a + 1}$\nNotice that this expression is in the form of  \"a + 1/a\".  This type of expression is minimized when 'a' is as close to 1 as possible.  However, 'a' and 'b' are non-zero real numbers, so 'a' cannot actually equal 1.\n**6. Find the minimum value:**\nSince 'a' cannot be exactly 1, the expression is minimized when 'a' is very slightly greater than 1.  Let's consider what happens as 'a' approaches 1:\n *  As 'a' gets closer to 1, the first term (a) gets closer to 1.\n *  As 'a' gets closer to 1, the second term (2/(a + 1)) gets larger and larger (approaches infinity).\nTherefore, as 'a' approaches 1 (from the right), the expression approaches infinity.  This means there is **no minimum value** for the expression. \n**Conclusion:**\nThe smallest possible value of  $\\frac{a}{b}+\\frac{b}{a}-ab$ is **undefined** (or we could say it approaches **negative infinity**).  There is no finite minimum. \n",
        "Here's a step-by-step solution to find the smallest possible value of the expression:\n**1. Manipulate the given equation:**\nStart with the equation  *ab = a - b*.  We can rearrange it to get:\n*ab + b = a*\n**2. Factor out common terms:**\nFactor out *b* on the left side and *a* on the right side:\n*b(a + 1) = a(1)*\n**3. Solve for a/b:**\nDivide both sides by *b(a + 1)* to isolate *a/b*:\n*a/b = 1/(a + 1)*\n**4. Substitute into the expression:**\nNow substitute the expression for *a/b* into the expression we want to minimize:\n*a/b + b/a - ab = 1/(a + 1) + b/(1/(a + 1)) - ab*\nSimplify the second term:\n*1/(a + 1) + (b(a + 1)) - ab*\n**5.  Express the expression in terms of a:**\nUsing the original equation *ab = a - b*, we can express *b* in terms of *a*:\n*b = (a - ab)/a = (1 - b)/a*\nSubstitute this expression for *b* into the simplified expression:\n*1/(a + 1) + ((1 - b)/a)(a + 1) - a((1 - b)/a)*\nSimplify further:\n*1/(a + 1) + (1 - b)(1 + 1/a) - (1 - b)*\n*1/(a + 1) + (1 - b)(1/a) = 1/(a + 1) + (1/a - b/a)*\n**6. Apply AM-GM inequality:**\nThe expression we're trying to minimize is now:\n*1/(a + 1) + (1/a - b/a)*\nNotice that the first term, *1/(a + 1)*, is always positive.  We can apply the AM-GM inequality to the second term:\n*(1/a - b/a) = 1/a(1 - b) >= 2 * sqrt((1/a)(1 - b)) / 2 = sqrt((1 - b)/a)*\n**7.  Find the minimum value:**\nSince *(1 - b)/a* is always positive, the minimum value of the entire expression occurs when the AM-GM inequality holds as an equality. This happens when:\n*1/a = 1 - b*\nFrom the original equation *ab = a - b*, we can rewrite this as:\n*1/a = ab*\n*a^2b = 1*\nSince *a* and *b* are non-zero, we know that *a^2b* is also non-zero. Therefore, this equation implies that *a^2b* is positive. However, if *a* and *b* are both negative, then *a^2b* would be negative, which is a contradiction. Therefore, both *a* and *b* must be positive.\nSince *a* and *b* are both positive, *a^2b = 1* implies that *a* and *b* are both positive, and their product is 1.  This tells us *a* and *b* are reciprocals of each other.\nSubstitute *b = 1/a* back into the expression:\n*1/(a + 1) + 1/a - b/a = 1/(a + 1) + 1/a - 1/a^2*\nNow, we can find the minimum value by substituting *b = 1/a* back into the original equation *ab = a - b*:\n*a(1/a) = a - 1/a*\n*1 = a - 1/a*\n*a^2 - a - 1 = 0*\nSolving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, we find that:\n*a = (1 \u00b1 sqrt(5))/2*\nSince *a* must be positive, we choose the positive solution:\n*a = (1 + sqrt(5))/2*\nNow, substitute this value of *a* back into the expression:\n*1/(a + 1) + 1/a - 1/a^2 = 1/((1 + sqrt(5))/2 + 1) + 1/((1 + sqrt(5))/2) - 1/((1 + sqrt(5))/2)^2*\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n*2/(3 + sqrt(5)) + 2/(1 + sqrt(5)) - 4/(6 + 2 * sqrt(5))*\n*=(2(3 - sqrt(5)) + 2(1 - sqrt(5)) - 4(6 - 2 * sqrt(5))) / (9 - 5)*\n*=(6 - 2*sqrt(5) + 2 - 2*sqrt(5) - 24 + 8*sqrt(5)) / 4*\n*=-16 + 4*sqrt(5) / 4*\n*=-4 + sqrt(5)*\n**Therefore, the smallest possible value of the expression is  -4 + sqrt(5).** \n",

Factor the numerator:**\n* Factor the numerator: `-(a - 2)(a + 1) / (a + 1)`\n* Cancel the common factor of `(a + 1)`: `-(a - 2)`\n**5. Analyze the expression:**\n* We now have the expression simplified to `2 - a`. Since `a` is non-zero, the smallest possible value occurs when `a` is as large as possible.  However, the equation `ab = a - b` tells us that `a` and `b` are both positive or both negative.  If they are both negative, then `a` is bounded above by `0`.  If they are both positive, then `a` is bounded above by `1`.  Therefore, the smallest possible value of `a` is `1`, and the smallest possible value of the expression is `2 - a = 2 - 1 = 1`.\n**Answer:** The smallest possible value of `a/b + b/a - ab` is **1**. \n"
