    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We know that $x^2 - y^2 = (x+y)(x-y)$. To begin with, let $x = 26^2 - 24^2 - 10$ and $y = 10$. Factoring $x^2 - y^2$ and substituting in gives $(26^2-24^2-10+10)(26^2-24^2-10-10)$. Now, let $x = 26$ and $y = 24$. Factoring $x^2 - y^2$ and substituting in gives $((26+24)(26-24)-10+10)((26+24)(26-24)-10-10)$. This simplifies to $(50\\cdot 2)(50 \\cdot 2 - 20)$, or $100 \\cdot 80$. Thus, our final answer is $\\boxed{8000}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Simplify the expression inside the first set of parentheses:**\n*  We can use the difference of squares factorization:  a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = (a + b)(a - b)\n*  So, 26\u00b2 - 24\u00b2 = (26 + 24)(26 - 24) = (50)(2) = 100\n* Now the expression becomes: (100 - 10)\u00b2 - 10\u00b2\n**2.  Simplify further:**\n* (100 - 10)\u00b2 - 10\u00b2 = (90)\u00b2 - 10\u00b2\n**3. Apply the difference of squares again:**\n* (90)\u00b2 - 10\u00b2 = (90 + 10)(90 - 10) = (100)(80)\n**4. Calculate the final result:**\n* (100)(80) = **8000**\n**Therefore, the value of (26\u00b2 - 24\u00b2 - 10)\u00b2 - 10\u00b2 is 8000.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n1. **Simplify the expression inside the first square:**\n   *  Notice that  (26\u00b2 - 24\u00b2) is a difference of squares. We can use the pattern: a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = (a + b)(a - b)\n   *  Therefore, (26\u00b2 - 24\u00b2) = (26 + 24)(26 - 24) = (50)(2) = 100\n   *  So, (26\u00b2 - 24\u00b2 - 10) = (100 - 10) = 90\n2. **Simplify the expression:**\n   * Now we have (90)\u00b2 - 10\u00b2 \n   * Again, we have a difference of squares: (90\u00b2 - 10\u00b2) = (90 + 10)(90 - 10) = (100)(80) = 8000\n**Therefore, the value of (26\u00b2 - 24\u00b2 - 10)\u00b2 - 10\u00b2 is 8000.** \n",
