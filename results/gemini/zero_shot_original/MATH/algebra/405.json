        "Here's how to find the distance between the points (-5, 5) and (5, -5):\n**1. Visualize the Points:**\nImagine these points on a coordinate plane.  Notice that they form the diagonal of a square.\n**2. Use the Distance Formula:**\nThe distance formula is derived from the Pythagorean theorem:\n*  Distance = \u221a[(x\u2082 - x\u2081)\u00b2 + (y\u2082 - y\u2081)\u00b2]\n**3. Plug in the Coordinates:**\nLet (-5, 5) be (x\u2081, y\u2081) and (5, -5) be (x\u2082, y\u2082).  Substitute these values into the distance formula:\n* Distance = \u221a[(5 - (-5))\u00b2 + (-5 - 5)\u00b2]\n**4. Simplify:**\n* Distance = \u221a[(10)\u00b2 + (-10)\u00b2]\n* Distance = \u221a(100 + 100)\n* Distance = \u221a200\n**5. Express in Simplest Radical Form:**\n* Distance = \u221a(100 * 2)\n* Distance = 10\u221a2\n**Therefore, the distance between the points (-5, 5) and (5, -5) is 10\u221a2.** \n",
        "1. **Visualize:** Imagine the two points plotted on a coordinate plane.  The distance between them is the length of the diagonal of a rectangle with sides of length 10 (the difference in x-coordinates) and 10 (the difference in y-coordinates).\n2. **Use the Pythagorean Theorem:**  The diagonal of the rectangle is the hypotenuse of a right triangle. We can use the Pythagorean Theorem: $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.  Here, $a = 10$ and $b = 10$, and we want to find $c$ (the distance between the points).\n3. **Solve for c:** \n   *  $10^2 + 10^2 = c^2$\n   *  $100 + 100 = c^2$\n   *  $200 = c^2$\n   *  $c = \\sqrt{200}$\n4. **Simplify the radical:**\n   * $c = \\sqrt{100 \\cdot 2}$\n   * $c = 10\\sqrt{2}$\n**Therefore, the distance between the points (-5, 5) and (5, -5) is 10\u221a2 units.** \n",

        "1. **Visualize the Points:** Imagine the points (-5, 5) and (5, -5) plotted on a coordinate plane. Notice that they form the opposite corners of a square.\n2. **Find the Diagonal:** The distance between the two points is the diagonal of this square.\n3. **Use the Pythagorean Theorem:**  We can find the length of the diagonal using the Pythagorean Theorem.  Since each side of the square has a length of 10 (5 - (-5) = 10), we have:\n   *  diagonal\u00b2 = side\u00b2 + side\u00b2\n   *  diagonal\u00b2 = 10\u00b2 + 10\u00b2\n   *  diagonal\u00b2 = 200\n4. **Simplify the Radical:** Take the square root of both sides:\n   * diagonal = \u221a200\n   * diagonal = \u221a(100 * 2) \n   * diagonal = 10\u221a2\n**Therefore, the distance between the points (-5, 5) and (5, -5) is 10\u221a2.** \n",
        "1. **Visualize the Points:**  Imagine the two points on a coordinate plane. You'll see they form a diagonal line.\n2. **Form a Right Triangle:**  You can draw a horizontal line from (-5, 5) to (5, 5) and a vertical line from (5, 5) to (5, -5). This creates a right triangle where the distance between the points is the hypotenuse.\n3. **Find the Lengths of the Legs:**\n   * The horizontal leg has length 5 - (-5) = 10.\n   * The vertical leg has length 5 - (-5) = 10.\n4. **Use the Pythagorean Theorem:** The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (a and b):  c\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2\n5. **Calculate:**\n   * c\u00b2 = 10\u00b2 + 10\u00b2\n   * c\u00b2 = 100 + 100\n   * c\u00b2 = 200\n   * c = \u221a200\n6. **Simplify the Radical:**\n   * c = \u221a(100 * 2) \n   * c = 10\u221a2\n**Therefore, the distance between the points (-5, 5) and (5, -5) is 10\u221a2.** \n"
