        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1.  Understanding the Problem**\nWe have four unknown integers (let's call them *a*, *b*, *c*, and *d*) and we know the sums of all possible pairs. Our goal is to find these integers in increasing order.\n**2. Finding the Largest and Smallest Integers**\n* **Largest:** The largest sum, 29, must be the sum of the two largest integers. Let's assume *a* is the largest and *b* is the second largest:  *a + b = 29*\n* **Smallest:** Similarly, the smallest sum, 10, must be the sum of the two smallest integers. Let's assume *c* is the smallest and *d* is the second smallest: *c + d = 10*\n**3. Finding the Missing Pairs**\nWe have four pairs left: 18, 19, 20, and 21.  These must be the sums of the following combinations:\n* *a + c*\n* *a + d*\n* *b + c*\n* *b + d*\n**4.  Analyzing the Sums**\n* Notice that the sums 19 and 20 are very close together.  This suggests that the two integers involved in these sums are also very close. \n*  Also, the difference between the sums 19 and 21 (and 20 and 29) is 2. This implies that *a* and *b* must be 2 apart. \n**5.  Solving for the Integers**\nLet's try to find *a* and *b*:\n* Since *a + b = 29* and *a* and *b* are 2 apart, the only possibilities are *a = 15* and *b = 14*.\nNow let's find *c* and *d*:\n* We know *c + d = 10*.\n* Since *a + c = 19*, we have *c = 19 - a = 19 - 15 = 4*.\n* Therefore, *d = 10 - c = 10 - 4 = 6*.\n**6.  Verification**\nLet's check if our solution works:\n* *a + b = 15 + 14 = 29*\n* *a + c = 15 + 4 = 19*\n* *a + d = 15 + 6 = 21*\n* *b + c = 14 + 4 = 18*\n* *b + d = 14 + 6 = 20*\n* *c + d = 4 + 6 = 10*\nAll the sums match the given information.\n**7.  Answer**\nThe four integers in increasing order are: **4, 6, 14, 15** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Analyze the Sums:**\n* **Notice the largest sum:** 29. This implies that two of the numbers are relatively large.\n* **Notice the smallest sum:** 10. This implies that two of the numbers are relatively small.\n**2.  Find the Middle Numbers:**\n* **Consider the sum 20:**  Since 29 is the largest sum, the number pairs contributing to 20 must involve the two smallest numbers. \n* **Consider the sum 18:** Similarly, the number pairs contributing to 18 must involve the two largest numbers.\n**3.  Deduce the Numbers:**\n* **Let's assume the smallest two numbers are x and y:**  We know x + y = 10 and x + z = 20 (where z is one of the larger numbers).  Subtracting these equations, we get z - y = 10. \n* **Now consider the sum 29:**  The largest two numbers must sum to 29.  Since one of the larger numbers is z, the other must be z + 9 (since 29 - 10 = 19).\n* **Therefore:** We have the following sums involving the largest two numbers: z + (z + 9) = 29.  This simplifies to 2z + 9 = 29, leading to z = 10.\n* **Substituting z = 10 back into x + z = 20:** We get x = 10. \n* **Now we know y = 0 (from x + y = 10).**\n* **And finally, the largest number is z + 9 = 19.**\n**4.  Solution:**\nThe four integers in increasing order are: **0, 10, 10, 19** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1.  Recognize the Pattern:**\n* Notice that the sums are all odd, except for 18 and 20. This suggests that three of the integers must be odd and one must be even.\n**2.  Find the Even Integer:**\n* The sum of the three odd integers must be even (since the sum of any three odd numbers is odd). \n* The only way to get an even sum from the given pairs is to use the pairs (19, 21) and (10, 20). \n* This means the even integer is the one that forms both (10, 20) and (18, 29), which is **10**.\n**3.  Find the Odd Integers:**\n* Since the even integer is 10, we know:\n    *  a + b = 10\n    *  a + c = 19\n    *  a + d = 20\n    *  b + c = 21\n    *  b + d = 29\n* Subtract the first equation from each of the others:\n    *  c - b = 9\n    *  d - b = 10\n    *  c - a = 11\n    *  d - a = 19\n* Notice that (c - b) + (d - a) = 20, which means c + d = 30.\n* Now we have two equations with two unknowns:\n    * c + d = 30\n    * c - b = 9\n* Solving this system gives us c = 19.5 and b = 10.5. However, since we need integers, we made a mistake somewhere.  Let's go back and look at the pairs again.\n**4.  Correcting Our Approach:**\n* The mistake is that we assumed the even integer was part of both pairs that lead to an even sum.  Instead, we can get those even sums by adding the following:\n    *  (19, 21) = 40 \n    *  (10, 20) = 30\n*  We can subtract these sums to get the missing pairs:\n    *  40 - 30 = 10  (This is the sum of the two odd numbers that are not 10)\n    *  Now we need to find the two odd numbers that sum to 10 and are part of pairs that lead to odd sums. \n* The only possible pairs that fit this description are (10, 20) and (10, 18).  Therefore, the missing pair is (1, 9).\n**5.  The Solution:**\n* The four integers are: 1, 9, 10, and 19. \n**Final Answer:** 1, 9, 10, 19 \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Find the Sum of All Integers**\nNotice that each integer appears in exactly three of the six sums. Therefore, the sum of all four integers is:\n(10 + 18 + 19 + 20 + 21 + 29) / 3 = 107 / 3\n**2. Identify the Largest and Smallest Integers**\n* The largest sum (29) must be the sum of the two largest integers.\n* The smallest sum (10) must be the sum of the two smallest integers.\n**3.  Deduce the Remaining Sums**\nLet's say the smallest integers are  *x* and *y*, and the largest integers are *w* and *z*.  We know:\n*  x + y = 10\n*  w + z = 29\nNow, consider the remaining sums:\n* 18, 19, 20, and 21.  These must be combinations of one of the smallest integers and one of the largest integers.\n**4.  Find the Values**\nLet's analyze the sums to find the values:\n* **The sum 20 is closest to the average of the sums 18, 19, 20, and 21.**  This suggests that 20 is likely formed by adding one of the smaller integers with one of the larger integers. \n* **The difference between 29 and 20 is 9.**  This difference could be the difference between one of the smaller integers and one of the larger integers.  \n* **Combining these observations, we can assume that 20 = x + z (or y + w) and 29 - 20 = 9 = z - x (or w - y).** \nIf we assume 20 = x + z, then 9 = z - x.  Solving this system of equations gives us z = 14.5 and x = 5.5.  Since the integers must be whole numbers, this assumption doesn't work.\nTherefore, we must have:\n* 20 = y + w\n* 9 = w - y\nSolving this system, we get w = 14.5 and y = 5.5. Again, this doesn't work because the integers must be whole numbers.\n**5.  Adjust Our Thinking**\nSince we've hit a roadblock, let's go back and consider how we can adjust our thinking.  The sums 18, 19, 20, and 21 are all close together, suggesting that they are formed by pairing a larger integer with a smaller integer. \nLet's try a different approach:\n* **Focus on the sums 19 and 21.**  These sums are consecutive, and the difference between them is 2.  This difference could be due to the difference between two of the smaller integers.\n* **Consider the sums 18 and 20.** These sums are also consecutive, and the difference between them is 2.  This difference could be due to the difference between two of the larger integers.\n**6.  Solve for the Integers**\nLet's label the integers in ascending order as  *a*, *b*, *c*, and *d*. We know:\n* a + b = 10\n* c + d = 29\nWe also know the differences between some pairs:\n* b - a = 2\n* d - c = 2\nSolving these systems of equations, we get:\n* a = 4\n* b = 6\n* c = 13\n* d = 15\n**Answer:** The four integers in increasing order are 4, 6, 13, 15. \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem:\n**1.  Understanding the Problem**\nWe're given six sums of four distinct integers taken in pairs.  Our goal is to find the original four integers.\n**2.  Key Observation**\nNotice that the sums 10, 18, 19, 20, 21, and 29 are all odd or even. This tells us that the four integers must be either all even or all odd.\n**3.  Finding the Largest and Smallest Integers**\n* The largest sum, 29, must be the result of adding the two largest integers.\n* The smallest sum, 10, must be the result of adding the two smallest integers.\n**4.  Using the Other Sums**\nLet's try to find the remaining integers. Consider the sums 19 and 21. Since they are both odd, they must come from adding one of the largest integers with one of the smallest integers. \n* If the largest two integers add to 29, and one of them is paired with the smallest integer to give 19, then the other largest integer must be paired with the second smallest integer to give 21.\n**5.  Solving for the Integers**\nLet's represent the integers as follows:\n*  Smallest:  *x*\n*  Second smallest:  *y*\n*  Second largest:  *z*\n*  Largest:  *w*\nWe now have the following equations:\n*  *x* + *y* = 10\n*  *z* + *w* = 29\n*  *x* + *w* = 19\n*  *y* + *w* = 21\nSolving this system of equations, we find:\n*  *x* = 3\n*  *y* = 7\n*  *z* = 12\n*  *w* = 17\n**6.  Answer**\nThe four integers in increasing order are: **3, 7, 12, 17** \n"
