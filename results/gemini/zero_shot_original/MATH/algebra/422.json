    "problem": "Richard is building a rectangular playground from 200 feet of fencing. The fencing must entirely enclose the playground. What is the maximum area of this playground?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let the length of the playground be $l$ and the width be $w$. We have the equation $2l+2w=200 \\Rightarrow l + w = 100$. We want to maximize the area of this rectangular playground, which is given by $lw$. From our equation, we know that $l=100-w$. Substituting this in to our expression for area, we have \\[(100-w)(w)=100w-w^2\\]We will now complete the square to find the maximum value of this expression. Factoring a $-1$ out, we have \\[-(w^2-100w)\\]In order for the expression inside the parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(100/2)^2=2500$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we get \\[-(w^2-100w+2500-2500) \\Rightarrow -(w-50)^2+2500\\]Since the maximum value of $-(w-50)^2$ is 0 (perfect squares are always nonnegative), the maximum value of the entire expression is 2500, which is achieved when $w=50$ and $l=100-w=50$ (the playground is a square). Thus, the maximum area of the playground is $\\boxed{2500}$ square feet.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Define Variables:**\n* Let the length of the playground be 'l' feet.\n* Let the width of the playground be 'w' feet.\n**2. Set Up Equations:**\n* **Perimeter:** The perimeter of a rectangle is given by: 2l + 2w = 200 (since the fencing encloses the entire playground)\n* **Area:** The area of a rectangle is given by: A = l * w\n**3. Express Area in Terms of One Variable:**\n* Simplify the perimeter equation: l + w = 100\n* Solve for 'l': l = 100 - w\n* Substitute this value of 'l' into the area equation: A = (100 - w) * w\n* Expand: A = 100w - w\u00b2\n**4. Find the Maximum Area:**\n* The area equation is a quadratic function (shaped like a parabola). The maximum value occurs at the vertex.\n* To find the x-coordinate of the vertex (which represents the width 'w' in our case), use the formula: w = -b / 2a, where 'a' and 'b' are the coefficients in the quadratic equation.\n* In our area equation, a = -1 and b = 100. Therefore: w = -100 / (2 * -1) = 50 feet.\n* This means the width that maximizes the area is 50 feet.\n**5. Calculate the Maximum Area:**\n* Substitute w = 50 feet back into the area equation: A = 100(50) - (50)\u00b2 = 5000 - 2500 = 2500 square feet.\n**Answer:** The maximum area of the playground is 2500 square feet. \n",
