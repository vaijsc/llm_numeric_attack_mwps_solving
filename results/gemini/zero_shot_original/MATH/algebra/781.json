        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the number of cookie pans needed:**\n* Each pan makes 15 cookies.\n* They need 216 cookies.\n* Number of pans needed: 216 cookies / 15 cookies/pan = 14.4 pans.  Since they can only make whole pans, they'll need **15 pans**.\n**2. Calculate the total tablespoons of butter needed:**\n* Each pan needs 3 tablespoons of butter.\n* They are making 15 pans.\n* Total tablespoons needed: 3 tablespoons/pan * 15 pans = 45 tablespoons\n**3. Determine the number of sticks of butter:**\n* There are 8 tablespoons in a stick of butter.\n* Number of sticks needed: 45 tablespoons / 8 tablespoons/stick = 5.625 sticks. Since they can only buy whole sticks, they'll need **6 sticks of butter**. \n**Answer:** Walter and Gretel will need **6 sticks of butter**. \n",
