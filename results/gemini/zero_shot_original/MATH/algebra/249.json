We know that $\\alpha\\beta = 18,$ and $\\alpha/\\beta = 2 \\implies \\alpha = 2\\beta.$\n\nSo $ b = -\\alpha - \\beta = -3\\beta.$ To maximize $b,$ we want to make $\\beta$ negative and as large as possible.

        "Here's a step-by-step solution:\n**1. Set up the Ratio**\nSince the roots are in the ratio 2:1, let the roots be $2k$ and $k$ for some value of $k$.\n**2. Use Vieta's Formulas**\nVieta's formulas relate the coefficients of a polynomial to its roots. For a quadratic equation of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the following hold:\n* **Sum of roots:**  -b/a\n* **Product of roots:** c/a\nIn our equation, $x^2 + bx + 18 = 0$, we have:\n* **Sum of roots:**  -(b/1) = -b\n* **Product of roots:** 18/1 = 18\n**3. Apply Vieta's Formulas to the Roots**\nSince the roots are $2k$ and $k$, we can write:\n* **Sum of roots:** 2k + k = -b \n* **Product of roots:** (2k)(k) = 18\n**4. Solve for b**\nFrom the sum of roots equation, we have 3k = -b.  From the product of roots equation, we have 2k\u00b2 = 18.  Solving the second equation for k, we get k\u00b2 = 9, so k = \u00b13.\nSince we want the largest possible value of *b*, we'll use k = -3.  Substituting into 3k = -b, we get:\n3(-3) = -b\n-9 = -b\nb = 9\n**Therefore, the largest possible value of b is 9.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Relationship Between Roots and Coefficients**\n* **Sum of Roots:**  For a quadratic equation of the form  $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the sum of the roots is  $-b/a$.\n* **Product of Roots:** The product of the roots is  $c/a$.\n**2. Set Up Equations Based on the Given Information**\nLet the two roots of the equation be $2k$ and $k$ (since they are in the ratio 2:1).  We can now use the relationships above:\n* **Sum of roots:**  $2k + k = -b/1$  (Since the coefficient of $x^2$ is 1)\n* **Product of roots:**  $2k \\cdot k = 18/1$ \n**3. Solve the Equations**\n* **Simplify the sum of roots equation:**  $3k = -b$\n* **Simplify the product of roots equation:** $2k^2 = 18$  \n* **Solve for k:**  $k^2 = 9$, so $k = 3$ or $k = -3$.\n**4. Find the Largest Possible Value of b**\n* **Substitute k back into the sum of roots equation:**\n    * If $k=3$, then $b = -9$\n    * If $k=-3$, then $b = 9$\n**Answer:** The largest possible value of $b$ is $\\boxed{9}$. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Set up the relationship between the roots**\nLet the two roots of the quadratic be $2r$ and $r$.  Since they are the roots of the equation, we know:\n*  $(2r)^2 + b(2r) + 18 = 0$ \n*  $r^2 + br + 18 = 0$\n**2. Simplify the equations**\nWe can simplify the first equation to:\n*  $4r^2 + 2br + 18 = 0$\n**3. Use the relationship between coefficients and roots**\nFor a quadratic equation of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the sum of the roots is $-b/a$ and the product of the roots is $c/a$.  Applying this to our problem:\n* **Sum of roots:**  $2r + r = -b/1 \\Rightarrow 3r = -b$\n* **Product of roots:** $(2r)(r) = 18/1 \\Rightarrow 2r^2 = 18 \\Rightarrow r^2 = 9$\n**4. Solve for 'r' and 'b'**\nSince $r^2 = 9$, we have two possibilities for $r$:  $r=3$ or $r=-3$. \n* If $r=3$, then $b = -3r = -9$.\n* If $r=-3$, then $b = -3r = 9$.\n**5. Determine the largest value of 'b'**\nThe largest possible value of $b$ is **9**. \n",

Find the largest possible value of b**\nSince the sum of roots is $-b$, we have:\n* If $k = 3$, then $-b = 2(3) + 3 = 9$, so $b = -9$.\n* If $k = -3$, then $-b = 2(-3) - 3 = -9$, so $b = 9$.\n**5.
