        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the x-intercepts:**\n* The x-intercepts occur when y = 0. So, we need to solve the equation:\n   0 = (x - 2)^2 - 9 / 3\n* Simplify: 0 = (x - 2)^2 - 3\n* Add 3 to both sides: 3 = (x - 2)^2\n* Take the square root of both sides: \u00b1\u221a3 = x - 2\n* Solve for x: x = 2 \u00b1 \u221a3\n* Therefore, the x-intercepts are at x = 2 + \u221a3 and x = 2 - \u221a3\n**2. Find the y-intercept:**\n* The y-intercept occurs when x = 0. Substitute x = 0 into the function:\n   f(0) = (0 - 2)^2 - 9 / 3 = 4 - 3 = 1\n* So, the y-intercept is at y = 1.\n**3. Visualize the polygon:**\n* The polygon is a triangle formed by connecting the x-intercepts (2 + \u221a3, 0) and (2 - \u221a3, 0) with the y-intercept (0, 1).\n**4. Calculate the area of the triangle:**\n* The base of the triangle is the distance between the x-intercepts: (2 + \u221a3) - (2 - \u221a3) = 2\u221a3\n* The height of the triangle is the y-coordinate of the y-intercept, which is 1.\n* The area of a triangle is (1/2) * base * height: (1/2) * 2\u221a3 * 1 = \u221a3\n**Therefore, the area of the polygon is \u221a3 square units.** \n",
