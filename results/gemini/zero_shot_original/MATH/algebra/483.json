        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Recognize the Pattern:**\nThe expression  $y^2 + 24y + 16 + k$  resembles the expansion of a squared binomial:\n*  $(y + a)^2 = y^2 + 2ay + a^2$\n**2. Identify the Key Values:**\n*  In our expression, the coefficient of the 'y' term is 24, which corresponds to  2a in the binomial expansion.  Therefore, a = 12.\n*  We know that the constant term in the squared binomial is  a\u00b2, which is  12\u00b2 = 144.\n**3. Determine the Constant 'k':**\n* Our expression currently has a constant term of 16. To make it a perfect square, we need to add a value that will make it equal to 144.\n* Therefore,  k = 144 - 16 = 128.\n**Conclusion:**\nThe constant  k = 128 will make the expression a perfect square:\n*  $y^2 + 24y + 16 + 128 = y^2 + 24y + 144 = (y + 12)^2$ \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**Understanding the Goal**\nWe want to find a value for *k* that makes the expression  *y\u00b2 + 24y + 16 + k*  a perfect square trinomial.  This means we want to express it in the form (y + a)\u00b2 for some value of *a*.\n**Perfect Square Trinomials**\nRecall the pattern for squaring a binomial:\n(y + a)\u00b2 = y\u00b2 + 2ay + a\u00b2\n**Matching the Pattern**\n1. **Identify the 'y' term:**  In our expression, the 'y' term is  24y. \n2. **Find 'a':**  We need to find a value for 'a' such that 2ay = 24y.  Solving for 'a', we get a = 12.\n3. **Calculate 'a\u00b2':**  Since a = 12, a\u00b2 = 144.\n**Finding the Value of k**\nTo make the expression a perfect square, we need to add *k* so that it becomes equal to a\u00b2.  Currently, we have a constant term of 16.  Therefore, we need to add:\nk = 144 - 16 = 128\n**The Answer**\nThe constant *k* that will make the expression a perfect square trinomial is **128**. \n",
        "Here's how to find the constant *k* that makes the expression a perfect square trinomial:\n**1. Recall the pattern:**\n   A perfect square trinomial follows this pattern: \n   (a + b)\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2  or  (a - b)\u00b2 = a\u00b2 - 2ab + b\u00b2\n**2. Identify the first and second terms:**\n   In our expression,  y\u00b2 + 24y + 16 + k:\n   * The first term is y\u00b2 (which is the square of y).\n   * The second term is 24y.\n**3. Find the missing term:**\n   * The middle term (24y) should be twice the product of the square root of the first term (y) and the square root of the constant term (which we'll call \"b\"). \n   * So, 24y = 2 * y * b\n   * Solving for b, we get: b = 12\n**4. Calculate the constant term:**\n   * The constant term (b\u00b2) should be the square of the value we found for b (12).\n   * Therefore, b\u00b2 = 12\u00b2 = 144\n**5. Determine the value of k:**\n   *  We know that the constant term in the perfect square trinomial should be 144. \n   * Our expression currently has a constant term of 16. \n   * To make it a perfect square, we need to add k = 144 - 16 = 128.\n**Therefore, k = 128 will make the expression a perfect square trinomial.**\n**The complete expression:**\ny\u00b2 + 24y + 16 + 128 = y\u00b2 + 24y + 144 = (y + 12)\u00b2 \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**Understanding the Problem**\nWe want to find a constant *k* that will make the expression a perfect square trinomial.  This means we want to rewrite it in the form:\n(y + a)\u00b2 \nwhere 'a' is a constant.\n**Steps**\n1. **Focus on the first two terms:**  The first two terms of our expression are  y\u00b2 + 24y. Notice that these terms will be part of the expansion of (y + a)\u00b2:\n   (y + a)\u00b2 = y\u00b2 + 2ay + a\u00b2 \n2. **Find 'a':**  Compare the coefficient of the 'y' term in our expression (24) with the coefficient of the 'y' term in the expanded form (2a).  We have:\n   2a = 24\n   a = 12\n3. **Determine 'k':**  Now we know that 'a' is 12. To complete the square, we need to add a\u00b2 (12\u00b2) to our expression:\n   y\u00b2 + 24y + 16 + k = (y + 12)\u00b2 \n   y\u00b2 + 24y + 16 + k = y\u00b2 + 24y + 144\n4. **Solve for 'k':** Subtract 16 from both sides of the equation:\n   k = 144 - 16\n   k = 128\n**Answer**\nTherefore, the constant k that makes the expression a perfect square is **k = 128**. \n",
