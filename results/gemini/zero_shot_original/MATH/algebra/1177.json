    "solution": "One week is equal to $7$ days, and the plant grows by $5\\%$ each day.  We can work backwards to find the previous size of the plant.  We can reverse the compound interest formula to solve this problem, as if the plant loses five percent of its height every day for $14$ days.  So the height of the plant two weeks ago is equal to $$452\\div(1+0.05)^{14}= 452\\div1.98=228.29$$So, the bean plant was $\\boxed{228.3}$ centimeters tall when Alice first found it.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n* **Days in two weeks:** There are 14 days in two weeks.\n* **Growth factor:** A 5% increase means the plant grows to 105% of its previous height each day.  This can be expressed as a decimal: 1.05.\n* **Working backward:** To find the plant's height two weeks ago, we need to \"undo\" the growth for each day.  We can do this by repeatedly dividing the current height by the growth factor.\nLet's calculate:\n* **Day 13:** 452 cm / 1.05 = 430.48 cm (approximately)\n* **Day 12:** 430.48 cm / 1.05 = 410.46 cm (approximately)\n* **...and so on, until we reach day 0**\nThis would be a tedious process to do by hand.  Instead, we can use a shortcut:\n* **Total growth factor:** The plant grew for 14 days with a growth factor of 1.05 each day. The total growth factor is 1.05 raised to the power of 14, or 1.05^14.\n* **Initial height:** Divide the current height by the total growth factor: 452 cm / 1.05^14 \u2248 252.1 cm\n**Therefore, the bean plant was approximately 252.1 centimeters tall two weeks ago.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Calculate the daily growth factor:**\n* A 5% increase means the plant grows to 105% of its previous height each day.\n* Convert this percentage to a decimal: 105% = 1.05\n**2. Determine the number of days since Alice noticed the plant:**\n* Two weeks is equal to 14 days.\n**3. Calculate the plant's height two weeks ago:**\n* Let the plant's height two weeks ago be represented by the variable 'x'.\n* After 14 days of growth, the plant's height is  x * (1.05)^14 = 452 cm\n* Solve for x: \n    * x = 452 cm / (1.05)^14 \n    * x \u2248 203.3 cm\n**Therefore, the plant was approximately 203.3 centimeters tall two weeks ago.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n* **Days since Alice's return:**  Two weeks is 14 days.\n* **Growth factor:** A 5% increase means the plant is multiplied by 1.05 each day.\n* **Reverse the growth:** To find the original height, we need to reverse the growth process.  We'll divide the current height by 1.05 for each day since Alice's return.\n**Calculation:**\n* Day 14: 452 cm \n* Day 13: 452 cm / 1.05 = 430.48 cm\n* Day 12: 430.48 cm / 1.05 = 410.45 cm\n* ... and so on, for 14 days.\n**Shortcut:**  Instead of dividing 14 times, we can use exponents:\n* Original height = Current height / (Growth factor)^number of days\n* Original height = 452 cm / (1.05)^14 \n* Original height \u2248 263.2 cm\n**Answer:** The bean plant was approximately **263.2 cm** tall two weeks ago. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n* **Days Since Alice Arrived:** Two weeks is 14 days.\n* **Growth Factor:** A 5% increase means the plant grows to 100% + 5% = 105% of its previous height each day.  As a decimal, this is 1.05.\n* **Working Backwards:** We need to find the height 14 days ago.  To do this, we'll repeatedly divide the current height by the growth factor.\n* **Calculation:**\n    * Day 13: 452 cm / 1.05 = 430.5 cm\n    * Day 12: 430.5 cm / 1.05 = 410.0 cm\n    * ... and so on, for 14 days.\nWe could continue this division for each day, but there's a faster way:\n* **Exponent:** Dividing by 1.05 fourteen times is the same as dividing by 1.05 raised to the power of 14.\n* **Final Calculation:** 452 cm / (1.05)^14 \u2248 234.6 cm\n**Answer:** The plant was approximately **234.6** centimeters tall when Alice first noticed it. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n* **Days since Alice noticed the plant:** Two weeks is 14 days.\n* **Daily growth factor:** A 5% increase means the plant is 1.05 times taller each day.\n* **Growth over 14 days:** The plant grew by a factor of 1.05 raised to the power of 14 (since it grew 1.05 times each day for 14 days):  1.05^14 \u2248 1.9799.\n* **Original height:**  To find the original height, divide the current height by the growth factor: 452 cm / 1.9799 \u2248 228.5 cm.\n**Therefore, the bean plant was approximately 228.5 centimeters tall when Alice first noticed it.** \n"
