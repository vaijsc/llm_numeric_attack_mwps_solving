        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Factor the quadratic expression:**\n* We need to find two numbers that multiply to give (24)(-35) = -840 and add up to -19 (the coefficient of the middle term). \n* After some trial and error, we find that -40 and 21 satisfy these conditions:  -40 * 21 = -840 and -40 + 21 = -19.\nNow, we can rewrite the middle term:\n*  24x\u00b2 - 19x - 35 = 24x\u00b2 - 40x + 21x - 35\n*  Next, factor by grouping: \n   *  (24x\u00b2 - 40x) + (21x - 35)\n   *  8x(3x - 5) + 7(3x - 5)\n   *  (3x - 5)(8x + 7) \n**2. Identify A, B, and C:**\n* Comparing our factored expression (3x - 5)(8x + 7) to (Ax - 5)(2Bx + C), we see:\n    * A = 3\n    * B = 4  (since 8x = 2 * 4x)\n    * C = 7\n**3. Calculate AB - 3C:**\n* AB - 3C = (3)(4) - 3(7) = 12 - 21 = -9\n**Therefore, AB - 3C = -9** \n",
