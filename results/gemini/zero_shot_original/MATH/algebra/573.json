    "solution": "Using the quadratic formula, we find that the roots of the quadratic are $\\frac{-5\\pm\\sqrt{5^2-4(3)(k)}}{6}=\\frac{-5\\pm\\sqrt{25-12k}}{6}$. Since the problem tells us that these roots must equal $\\frac{-5\\pm i\\sqrt{11}}{6}$, we have \\begin{align*} \\sqrt{25-12k}&=i\\sqrt{11}\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad \\sqrt{25-12k}&=\\sqrt{-11}\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad 25-12k&=-11\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad 12k&=36\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad k&=\\boxed{3}.\n\\end{align*}",
