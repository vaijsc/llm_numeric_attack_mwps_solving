        "Here's how to determine the degree of the polynomial  *f(x) - g(x)*:\n**Understanding Degree**\n* The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of the variable in the polynomial. \n**Subtracting Polynomials**\n* When you subtract polynomials, you only subtract the coefficients of like terms. This doesn't change the highest power of the variable.\n**The Answer**\nSince *f(x)* has a degree of 4 and *g(x)* has a degree of 2, the highest power of the variable in *f(x) - g(x)* will be **4**.  This is because the term with the highest power (x\u2074) in *f(x)* will not be affected by the subtraction of *g(x)*.\n**Therefore, the degree of the polynomial *f(x) - g(x)* is 4.** \n",

Subtracting Polynomials**\n* When subtracting polynomials, we combine like terms.  This means terms with the same variable and exponent are added or subtracted.\n**3.  The Dominant Term**\n* The degree of the resulting polynomial will be determined by the highest power term that *survives* after combining like terms.\n**4.  Applying the Concepts**\n* Since $f(x)$ has degree 4, it has a term with $x^4$ (and possibly other lower-degree terms).\n* Since $g(x)$ has degree 2, it has a term with $x^2$ (and possibly other lower-degree terms).\nWhen we subtract $g(x)$ from $f(x)$, the $x^4$ term from $f(x)$ will not be cancelled out. No term in $g(x)$ has a degree of 4 or higher. \n**Conclusion:**\nThe polynomial $f(x) - g(x)$ will still have a term with $x^4$, making its degree **4**. \n",
