        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n1. **Solve for a common variable:**  We want to get both equations in terms of the same variable so we can relate *x* and *z*. Let's solve both equations for *y*:\n   *  From the first equation,  $3x = 8y$, we get  $y = \\frac{3}{8}x$\n   *  From the second equation, $5y = 15z$, we get $y = 3z$\n2. **Set the expressions for *y* equal to each other:** Since both expressions equal *y*, they must be equal to each other:\n   * $\\frac{3}{8}x = 3z$\n3. **Solve for  *x/z*:**  Now we can isolate *x/z*:\n   * Multiply both sides by 8:  $3x = 24z$\n   * Divide both sides by 3z:  $\\frac{x}{z} = \\boxed{8}$ \n",
