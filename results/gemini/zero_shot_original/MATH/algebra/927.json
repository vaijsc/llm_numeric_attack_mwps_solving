    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "You can multiply the binomials in the order $(x-2)(x-2)(x+2)(x+2)$, but multiplying $(x-2)(x+2)$ first and then squaring the result means fewer terms to worry about since $-2x$ and $2x$ cancel each other. When we multiply $(x-2)(x+2)$, we get $x^2+2x-2x-4=x^2-4$. There is another set of $(x-2)(x+2)$ that also equals $(x^2-4)$. So, the simplified expression is $(x^2-4)(x^2-4)=x^4-8x^2+16$. The product of the coefficients is $1\\cdot-8\\cdot16=\\boxed{-128}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Recognize the pattern:**\nThe expression $(x-2)^2(x+2)^2$ is a difference of squares pattern in disguise. Notice that:\n* $(x-2)^2$ represents the square of the difference of  'x' and '2'.\n* $(x+2)^2$ represents the square of the sum of 'x' and '2'.\n**2. Apply the difference of squares pattern:**\nThe difference of squares pattern states:  a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = (a + b)(a - b)\nLet's apply this to our problem:\n*  a = (x - 2)\n*  b = (x + 2)\nTherefore, we can rewrite the expression:\n(x - 2)\u00b2 (x + 2)\u00b2  =  [(x - 2) + (x + 2)][(x - 2) - (x + 2)]\n**3. Simplify the expression:**\nSimplify the terms inside the brackets:\n* [(x - 2) + (x + 2)] = 2x \n* [(x - 2) - (x + 2)] = -4\nNow, the expression becomes:\n(2x)(-4) = -8x\n**4. Identify the coefficients:**\nThe resulting expression is -8x.  The only non-zero coefficient is -8.\n**5. Calculate the product:**\nSince there's only one non-zero coefficient, the product of the non-zero coefficients (including the constant term) is simply **-8**. \n",
