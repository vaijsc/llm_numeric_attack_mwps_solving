    "solution": "Given that we have $- 35 - x + 12x^2$ and the factor $3x + 5$, we can guess that the other factor must be $4x - 7$ since the linear terms must multiply to $12x^2$ and the constant terms must multiply to $-35.$\n\nExpanding, we can verify that this is correct, and therefore our answer is $\\boxed{(4x - 7)}.$",

        "Here's how to find the other factor:\n**1. Understand the problem:**\n* We know one factor of the quadratic expression is (3x + 5).\n* We need to find the other factor.\n**2.  Use the distributive property (or FOIL):**\n* Since we know one factor, we can assume the other factor is of the form (ax + b).\n*  To get the original expression, we multiply the two factors:\n   (3x + 5)(ax + b) = 3ax\u00b2 + 3bx + 5ax + 5b \n**3.  Match coefficients:**\n*  Compare the terms in the expanded form to the original expression: \n    *  3ax\u00b2 = 12x\u00b2  (This tells us a = 4)\n    *  3bx + 5ax = -x  (This tells us 3b + 5a = -1)\n    *  5b = -35 (This tells us b = -7)\n**4.  Find the other factor:**\n*  Since we know a = 4 and b = -7, the other factor is (4x - 7).\n**Therefore, the other factor of the quadratic expression is (4x - 7).** \n",
        "Here's how to find the other factor:\n**1. Understand Factoring**\nFactoring a quadratic expression means writing it as a product of two linear expressions (expressions with the highest power of the variable being 1).\n**2. Use the Given Factor**\nWe know one factor is (3x + 5). Let the other factor be (ax + b), where 'a' and 'b' are the coefficients we need to find.\n**3. Expand and Compare**\n* Multiply the two factors: (3x + 5)(ax + b) = 3ax\u00b2 + (3b + 5a)x + 5b\n* Compare this with the original expression: -35 - x + 12x\u00b2\n**4. Match Coefficients**\n* **x\u00b2 term:** 3a = 12.  Solving for 'a', we get a = 4.\n* **Constant term:** 5b = -35. Solving for 'b', we get b = -7.\n**5. The Other Factor**\nNow that we know a = 4 and b = -7, the other factor is (ax + b) = (4x - 7).\n**Therefore, the other factor is (4x - 7).** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n1. **Understand factoring:** Factoring a quadratic expression means finding two binomials that multiply together to give the original expression. \n2. **Recognize the pattern:** Since we know one factor is (3x + 5), the other factor must be a binomial that, when multiplied by (3x + 5), results in the original expression: -35 - x + 12x\u00b2.\n3. **Focus on the leading term:** The leading term of the original expression is 12x\u00b2. To get this term, the leading term of the other factor must be 4x (since 3x * 4x = 12x\u00b2).\n4. **Focus on the constant term:** The constant term of the original expression is -35.  To get this term, the constant term of the other factor must be -7 (since 5 * -7 = -35).\n5. **Check the middle term:** The middle term of the original expression is -x. Let's see if the factors we've found give us this term:\n    *  (3x + 5)(4x - 7) = 12x\u00b2 - 21x + 20x - 35 = 12x\u00b2 - x - 35\n6. **Conclusion:** The other factor is **(4x - 7)**. \n",
        "Here's how to find the other factor:\n1. **Recognize the structure:**  The expression $-35-x+12x^2$ is a quadratic trinomial (a polynomial with three terms and the highest power of the variable is 2).\n2. **Use the known factor:**  Since we know one factor is $(3x + 5)$, we can use the distributive property (or FOIL) to work backward. We need to find a binomial that, when multiplied by $(3x + 5)$, gives us the original trinomial.\n3. **Set up the multiplication:** Let the other factor be $(ax + b)$.  We have:\n   (3x + 5)(ax + b) = -35 - x + 12x\u00b2\n4. **Expand the product:** Using FOIL, we get:\n   3ax\u00b2 + 3bx + 5ax + 5b = -35 - x + 12x\u00b2\n5. **Match coefficients:** To find the values of 'a' and 'b', we compare the coefficients of the terms on both sides of the equation:\n   * **x\u00b2 term:** 3a = 12  =>  a = 4\n   * **x term:** 3b + 5a = -1  =>  3b + 20 = -1  =>  3b = -21 => b = -7\n   * **constant term:** 5b = -35  =>  b = -7 (This confirms our value of 'b')\n6. **The other factor:** Now that we know a = 4 and b = -7, the other factor is (4x - 7).\n**Therefore, the complete factorization is:**\n(-35 - x + 12x\u00b2) = (3x + 5)(4x - 7) \n",
