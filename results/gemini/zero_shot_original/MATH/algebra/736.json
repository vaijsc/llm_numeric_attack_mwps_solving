    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let the lengths of the portions for runners $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, and $E$ be $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$, and $e$, respectively. From the problem conditions, we have the equations \\begin{align*}\na+b+c+d+e&=100\\\\\nb&=1.5a\\\\\nc+d&=2(a+b)\\\\\ne&=10\n\\end{align*} Plugging in the value of $e$ into the first equation, we have $a+b+c+d=90$. Substituting the third original equation into this last equation, we have $a+b+2(a+b)=90\\Rightarrow a+b=30$. From the second original equation, we have $b=1.5a\\Rightarrow a=\\frac{2}{3}b$. Substituting this last equation into the equation $a+b=30$ to eliminate $a$, we have $\\frac{2}{3}b+b=30$, so $b=18$. Thus, Runner $B$ ran $\\boxed{18}$ miles.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Define variables:**\n* Let  'x' represent the number of miles Runner A ran.\n* Runner B ran 1.5x miles.\n* Runners C and D combined ran 2(x + 1.5x) = 5x miles.\n* Runner E ran 10 miles.\n**2. Set up an equation:**\nThe total miles of the race is the sum of the miles each runner ran:\nx + 1.5x + 5x + 10 = 100\n**3. Solve for x:**\n* Combine like terms: 7.5x + 10 = 100\n* Subtract 10 from both sides: 7.5x = 90\n* Divide both sides by 7.5: x = 12\n**4. Find the distance Runner B ran:**\n* Runner B ran 1.5x miles, so they ran 1.5 * 12 = 18 miles.\n**Answer:** Runner B ran **18 miles**. \n",

Define variables:**\n* Let  'x' represent the number of miles Runner A ran.\n* Runner B ran 1.5 times the distance of Runner A, so Runner B ran 1.5x miles.\n**2. Calculate the combined distance for Runners A and B:**\n* Total distance for Runners A and B: x + 1.5x = 2.5x miles\n**3. Calculate the combined distance for Runners C and D:**\n* Runners C and D ran twice the distance of Runners A and B: 2 * 2.5x = 5x miles\n**4. Calculate the total distance for Runners A, B, C, and D:**\n* Total distance for Runners A, B, C, and D: 2.5x + 5x = 7.5x miles\n**5.  Consider Runner E's distance:**\n* Runner E ran the last 10 miles, so the combined distance for Runners A, B, C, and D must be 100 - 10 = 90 miles.\n**6.  Solve for x:**\n*  7.5x = 90\n*  x = 12 miles (This is the distance Runner A ran)\n**7.  Calculate Runner B's distance:**\n*  Runner B ran 1.5x miles, so Runner B ran 1.5 * 12 = **18 miles**\n**Therefore, Runner B ran 18 miles.** \n",
