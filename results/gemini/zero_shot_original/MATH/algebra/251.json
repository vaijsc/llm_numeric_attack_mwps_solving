        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand Parallel Lines:**\n* Parallel lines have the same slope. \n**2. Find the Slopes:**\n* **Line 1:**  The equation is in slope-intercept form (y = mx + b), where 'm' represents the slope.  So the slope of the first line is (3a + 2).\n* **Line 2:**  To find the slope of the second line, we need to rewrite it in slope-intercept form:\n    * Divide both sides by 2:  y = (a - 4)/2 * x + 1\n    * The slope of the second line is (a - 4)/2.\n**3. Set the Slopes Equal:**\n* Since the lines are parallel, their slopes must be equal:\n    * (3a + 2) = (a - 4)/2\n**4. Solve for 'a':**\n* Multiply both sides by 2:  6a + 4 = a - 4\n* Subtract 'a' from both sides: 5a + 4 = -4\n* Subtract 4 from both sides: 5a = -8\n* Divide both sides by 5: a = -8/5\n**Therefore, the value of 'a' is -8/5.** \n",
