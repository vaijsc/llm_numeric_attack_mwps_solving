    "solution": "The shortest line from the point $(6,0)$ to the given line will be perpendicular to it.  A line perpendicular to $y=2x-2$ will have a slope of $-1/2$.  This will give it a form of $y=-\\frac{1}{2}x+b$.  Substituting the point $(6,0)$ that we know must lie on this line, we find: $$0=-\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 6 +b$$ $$3=b$$ The equation of the perpendicular line is $y=-\\frac{1}{2}x+3$.  Now, we can solve for the point where the two lines intersect: $$-\\frac{1}{2}x+3=2x-2$$ $$5=\\frac{5}{2}x$$ $$x=2$$ Plugging into either line, we find the point of intersection is $(2,2)$.

        "Here's how to find the shortest distance:\n**1. Visualize the Problem**\nImagine the point (6, 0) and the line y = 2x - 2. The shortest distance from the point to the line is a perpendicular segment.\n**2. Find the Equation of the Perpendicular Line**\n* The slope of the given line (y = 2x - 2) is 2.\n* The slope of a line perpendicular to this line is the negative reciprocal, which is -1/2.\n* Since the perpendicular line passes through (6, 0), we can use the point-slope form of a linear equation:  y - y\u2081 = m(x - x\u2081)\n* Substitute: y - 0 = (-1/2)(x - 6)\n* Simplify: y = (-1/2)x + 3\n**3. Find the Point of Intersection**\n* Now we have two equations:\n    * y = 2x - 2\n    * y = (-1/2)x + 3\n* Solve for x by setting the right sides equal: 2x - 2 = (-1/2)x + 3\n* Combine like terms: (5/2)x = 5\n* Solve for x: x = 2\n* Substitute x = 2 into either equation to find y: y = 2(2) - 2 = 2\n* The point of intersection is (2, 2).\n**4. Calculate the Distance**\n* Use the distance formula to find the distance between (6, 0) and (2, 2): \n   \u221a[(6 - 2)\u00b2 + (0 - 2)\u00b2] = \u221a(16 + 4) = \u221a20 \n**5. Simplify the Answer**\n* Simplify the radical: \u221a20 = \u221a(4 * 5) = 2\u221a5\n**Therefore, the shortest distance from the point (6, 0) to the line y = 2x - 2 is 2\u221a5.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Concept**\nThe shortest distance from a point to a line is the perpendicular distance.  This means we need to find the line perpendicular to  y = 2x - 2 that passes through the point (6,0).\n**2. Find the Slope of the Perpendicular Line**\n* The slope of the given line (y = 2x - 2) is 2. \n* Perpendicular lines have slopes that are negative reciprocals of each other.  Therefore, the slope of the perpendicular line is -1/2.\n**3. Find the Equation of the Perpendicular Line**\n* We know the slope (-1/2) and a point (6,0) that the perpendicular line passes through.  We can use the point-slope form of a linear equation:\n   y - y1 = m(x - x1)\n   y - 0 = (-1/2)(x - 6)\n   y = (-1/2)x + 3\n**4. Find the Intersection Point**\n* Now we need to find where the two lines intersect.  We have the equations:\n   y = 2x - 2 \n   y = (-1/2)x + 3\n*  Solve for x and y by setting the equations equal to each other:\n    2x - 2 = (-1/2)x + 3\n    (5/2)x = 5\n    x = 2\n*  Substitute x = 2 into either equation to find y:\n    y = 2(2) - 2 = 2\n**5. Calculate the Distance**\n* Now we have the point of intersection (2, 2).  We can use the distance formula to find the distance between (6, 0) and (2, 2):\n   Distance = \u221a[(6 - 2)\u00b2 + (0 - 2)\u00b2] = \u221a(16 + 4) = \u221a20 = **2\u221a5**\n**Therefore, the shortest distance from the point (6, 0) to the line y = 2x - 2 is 2\u221a5.** \n",
