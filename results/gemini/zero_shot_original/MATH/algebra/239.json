Substitute and solve for xy:**\n   Notice that the left-hand side of the equation from step 2 is very similar to the left-hand side of the equation from step 1.  Let's substitute  `y + x = 5xy` into the second equation:\n   ```\n   3xy + 5xy - 4 = 0\n   8xy = 4\n   xy = 1/2\n   ```\n**4. Factor and substitute:**\n   We want to find  `x\u00b2y + xy\u00b2`.  Notice that we can factor this expression:\n   ```\n   x\u00b2y + xy\u00b2 = xy(x + y)\n   ```\n   We know `xy = 1/2` and from the first equation (step 1) we have `x + y = 5xy`. Substitute these values:\n   ```\n   xy(x + y) = (1/2)(5xy) = (1/2)(5)(1/2) = 5/4\n   ```\n**Therefore,  x\u00b2y + xy\u00b2 = 5/4** \n",

Solve for possible values of x and y:**\n* Since the right-hand side is 4, we need to find factors of 4 that will give us possible values for (x + 1) and (3y + 1). The factors of 4 are 1, 2, 4, -1, -2, and -4.  We can explore the possibilities:\n   * **Case 1:**  (x + 1) = 1 and (3y + 1) = 4.

This gives us x = 1 and y = 1/3.\n   * **Case 4:**  (x + 1) = -1 and (3y + 1) = -4. This gives us x = -2 and y = -5/3.\n   * **Case 5:**  (x + 1) = -4 and (3y + 1) = -1. This gives us x = -5 and y = -2/3.\n   * **Case 6:**  (x + 1) = -2 and (3y + 1) = -2. This gives us x = -3 and y = -1.\n**5.
