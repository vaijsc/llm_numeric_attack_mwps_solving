        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Factor the quadratic:**\nThe expression $n^2 - 3n + 2$ factors nicely:\n  \n  *  $n^2 - 3n + 2 = (n - 1)(n - 2)$\n**2. Analyze the factors:**\n* For the product of two integers to be prime, one factor must be 1 and the other must be the prime number itself.\n**3. Find the possible values of n:**\n* **Case 1:** If  n - 1 = 1, then n = 2. \n* **Case 2:** If n - 2 = 1, then n = 3.\n**4. Check if the values produce prime numbers:**\n* When n = 2, the expression becomes (2 - 1)(2 - 2) = 0, which is not prime.\n* When n = 3, the expression becomes (3 - 1)(3 - 2) = 2, which is prime.\n**Conclusion:**\nThere is only **one** positive integer value of *n* for which the expression $n^2 - 3n + 2$ is a prime number. \n",

Analyze the factors:**\n*  For the expression to be prime, one factor must equal 1 and the other must be a prime number. \n**3. Find the possible values of n:**\n* If  (n - 1) = 1, then n = 2.  In this case, (n - 2) = 0, which is not prime.\n* If (n - 2) = 1, then n = 3.  In this case, (n - 1) = 2, which is prime.\n**4. Conclusion:**\nThe only value of *n* that makes the expression prime is *n = 3*.  Therefore, there is only **one** positive integer *n* that satisfies the condition. \n",

Analyze the factors:**\n* For the expression to be prime, one of the factors must be 1 and the other must be a prime number.\n**3. Find the possible values of 'n':**\n* If (n - 1) = 1, then n = 2.  This gives us (2 - 1)(2 - 2) = 0, which is not prime.\n* If (n - 2) = 1, then n = 3. This gives us (3 - 1)(3 - 2) = 2, which is prime.\n**4.
