        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Set the equations equal to each other:**\nSince the parabolas intersect, their y-values are equal at the points of intersection.  So, we can set the equations equal to each other:\n  x\u00b2 + 4x + 6 = (1/2)x\u00b2 + x + 6\n**2. Solve for x:**\n* Subtract (1/2)x\u00b2 from both sides: (1/2)x\u00b2 + 4x + 6 = x + 6\n* Subtract x and 6 from both sides: (1/2)x\u00b2 + 3x = 0\n* Factor out x: x((1/2)x + 3) = 0\n* Set each factor equal to zero: \n    * x = 0 \n    * (1/2)x + 3 = 0  =>  x = -6\n**3. Find the corresponding y-values:**\nWe now have two x-values where the parabolas intersect. Let's find the corresponding y-values using either of the original equations.  Let's use  y = (1/2)x\u00b2 + x + 6.\n* For x = 0:  y = (1/2)(0)\u00b2 + (0) + 6 = 6\n* For x = -6: y = (1/2)(-6)\u00b2 + (-6) + 6 = 18\n**4. Determine the values of a, b, c, and d:**\nSince c \u2265 a, we have:\n* a = -6\n* b = 18\n* c = 0\n* d = 6\n**5. Calculate c - a:**\nc - a = 0 - (-6) = **6** \n",
        "1. **Set the equations equal to each other:** Since the parabolas intersect at the same points, their y-values must be equal.

So one intersection point is (0, 6).\n   * For x = -6: y = (-6)\u00b2 + 4(-6) + 6 = 18. So the other intersection point is (-6, 18).\n4. **Determine c and a:** Since c \u2265 a, we know that c = 0 and a = -6.\n5. **Calculate c - a:**  c - a = 0 - (-6) = **6**. \nTherefore, c - a = **6**. \n",
