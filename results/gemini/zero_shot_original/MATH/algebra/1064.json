    "problem": "A set of four consecutive integers has a sum of 22. If each integer of the set is increased by 2 and then multiplied by 20, what is the sum of the new set of integers?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Increasing each integer by 2 will increase their sum by $2\\cdot 4 = 8$, meaning the sum after this step is $22 + 8 = 30$.  Multiplying each integer by 20 will multiply the entire sum by 20, leading to a final sum of $30\\cdot 20 = \\boxed{600}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step by step:\n**1. Find the original integers:**\n* Let the first integer be represented by 'x'.\n* The four consecutive integers are: x, x + 1, x + 2, x + 3\n* Their sum is 22:  x + (x + 1) + (x + 2) + (x + 3) = 22\n* Simplify: 4x + 6 = 22\n* Solve for x: 4x = 16 \n* Therefore, x = 4\n* The original set of integers is: 4, 5, 6, 7\n**2. Increase each integer by 2:**\n* The new set is: 6, 7, 8, 9\n**3. Multiply each integer by 20:**\n* The final set is: 120, 140, 160, 180\n**4.
