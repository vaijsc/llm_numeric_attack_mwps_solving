    "solution": "Because the parabola has vertex $(2,3)$, it is the graph of  \\[y=a(x-2)^2+3\\] for some number $a$.  In order for the graph to contain the point $(4,4)$, we must also have  \\[4=a(4-2)^2+3=4a+3,\\] so $a=\\frac14$, and our parabola is the graph of \\[y=\\frac14(x-2)^2 + 3.\\] Setting $x=6$ in this gives us  \\[y = \\frac14(6-2)^2 + 3 = 4+3=\\boxed{7}.\\]",
