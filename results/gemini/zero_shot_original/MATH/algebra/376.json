        "Here's how to find the domain of the given rational function:\n**1. Identify the Restrictions:**\nThe only time a rational function (a function that is a fraction with polynomials in the numerator and denominator) is undefined is when the denominator is equal to zero. So, we need to find the values of *x* that make the denominator zero.\n**2. Factor the Denominator:**\nThe denominator factors as: \n  \n  *x\u00b2 + 4x - 21 = (x + 7)(x - 3)*\n**3. Find the Values that Make the Denominator Zero:**\nSet the factors equal to zero and solve:\n* x + 7 = 0  =>  x = -7\n* x - 3 = 0  =>  x = 3\n**4. Express the Domain:**\nThe domain is all real numbers except for the values that make the denominator zero. We can express this in interval notation:\n**(-\u221e, -7) \u222a (-7, 3) \u222a (3, \u221e)** \n",
        "1. **Identify the denominator:** The denominator of the expression is  $x^2 + 4x - 21$.\n2. **Find the values that make the denominator zero:** We need to solve the equation $x^2 + 4x - 21 = 0$. This factors as $(x+7)(x-3) = 0$, giving us solutions $x = -7$ and $x = 3$.\n3. **Exclude those values from the domain:**  Since division by zero is undefined, the domain of the expression must exclude the values $x=-7$ and $x=3$.\n4. **Express the domain in interval notation:**  The domain consists of all real numbers except for -7 and 3.  We can express this in interval notation as:  \n   \n   **(-\u221e, -7) \u222a (-7, 3) \u222a (3, \u221e)** \n",
        "**1. Identify the denominator:**\nThe denominator of the expression is  $x^2 + 4x - 21$.\n**2. Find the values that make the denominator zero:**\nWe need to find the roots of the quadratic equation $x^2 + 4x - 21 = 0$.  We can factor this as $(x+7)(x-3) = 0$, which means the roots are $x=-7$ and $x=3$.\n**3. Exclude those values from the domain:**\nThe denominator cannot be zero, so we must exclude $x=-7$ and $x=3$ from the domain.\n**4. Express the domain in interval notation:**\nSince we're excluding $x=-7$ and $x=3$, the domain is all real numbers except those two values.
