    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Suppose we played $x$ games.  Since we won $2/9$ of the games we played, we won $(2/9)x = 2x/9$ games. Therefore, we lost $x - 2x/9 = 7x/9$ games.  Since we lost 15 more games than we won, we have \\[\\frac{7x}{9} - \\frac{2x}{9} = 15.\\]Simplifying the left side gives $5x/9 = 15$, and solving this equation gives $x = \\boxed{27}$ games played.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Represent the wins and losses:**\n* Let 'w' represent the number of games won.\n* Since we lost 15 more games than we won, we lost 'w + 15' games.\n**2. Set up an equation based on the fraction of wins:**\n* The fraction of games won is represented by the ratio:  (games won) / (total games) = 2/9\n* We can write this as: w / (w + (w + 15)) = 2/9\n**3. Solve for 'w':**\n* Simplify the denominator: w / (2w + 15) = 2/9\n* Cross-multiply: 9w = 4w + 30\n* Combine 'w' terms: 5w = 30\n* Solve for 'w': w = 6\n**4. Calculate the total number of games:**\n* Total games = games won + games lost\n* Total games = 6 + (6 + 15) = 27\n**Answer:** Your baseball team played a total of **27** games this year. \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Fractions:**\n*  If our team won 2/9 of its games, that means they lost 7/9 of their games (since the whole season is represented by 9/9).\n**2. Set up a Relationship:**\n* We know the team lost 15 more games than they won. This means the difference between the number of losses and wins is 15.\n**3.  Represent the Difference with Fractions:**\n* The difference between the fraction of lost games (7/9) and the fraction of won games (2/9) is (7/9) - (2/9) = 5/9.\n**4.  Find the Value of One Ninth:**\n* We know the difference of 5/9 represents 15 games. To find the value of one ninth (1/9), divide 15 by 5: 15 / 5 = 3 games.\n**5. Calculate the Total Games Played:**\n* Since one ninth (1/9) is equal to 3 games, the entire season (9/9) is equal to 9 * 3 = 27 games.\n**Answer:** Your team played 27 games this year. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Fractions:**\n* The team won 2/9 of its games. This means that for every 9 games played, they won 2.\n**2.  Represent the Wins and Losses:**\n* Let 'x' be the number of games the team won.\n* Since they lost 15 more games than they won, they lost 'x + 15' games.\n**3. Set Up an Equation:**\n* The total number of games played is the number of wins plus the number of losses: x + (x + 15)\n**4. Use the Fraction Information:**\n* We know the team won 2/9 of its games.  This means the number of wins (x) is 2/9 of the total number of games:  x = (2/9)(x + (x + 15))\n**5. Solve for x (the number of wins):**\n*  x = (2/9)(2x + 15)\n*  9x = 4x + 30\n*  5x = 30\n*  x = 6  (The team won 6 games)\n**6. Calculate the Total Games Played:**\n* Total games = wins + losses\n* Total games = 6 + (6 + 15) \n* Total games = 27\n**Answer:** The team played **27** games this year. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step by step:\n**1. Understand the Fractions:**\n* The team won 2/9 of its games. This means for every 9 games played, they won 2. \n* Since they lost more games than they won, the remaining 7/9 of the games represent losses.\n**2.  Set up a Relationship:**\n* Let 'x' represent the number of games the team won.\n* Since they lost 15 more games than they won, they lost 'x + 15' games.\n**3. Use the Fractions:**\n* The fraction of games won (2/9) is equal to the number of wins (x) divided by the total number of games played (x + x + 15).  This can be written as: \n   * 2/9 = x / (2x + 15)\n**4. Solve for x:**\n* Cross-multiply: 2 * (2x + 15) = 9 * x\n* Simplify: 4x + 30 = 9x\n* Subtract 4x from both sides: 30 = 5x\n* Divide both sides by 5: x = 6\n**5. Calculate Total Games:**\n* The team won 6 games (x = 6).\n* They lost 6 + 15 = 21 games.\n* Total games played: 6 + 21 = 27\n**Answer:** The team played **27** games this year. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Fractions:**\n* If the team won 2/9 of its games, that means they lost 7/9 of their games (since the whole is always 9/9).\n**2.  Set Up a Relationship:**\n* We know the team lost 15 more games than they won.  This means the difference between the number of losses and wins is 15.\n**3.  Find the Fraction Representing the Difference:**\n* The difference in games won and lost is represented by the fraction 7/9 - 2/9 = 5/9\n**4.  Represent the Difference as a Number:**\n* We know the difference of 5/9 of the games represents 15 games.\n**5.  Calculate the Total Games:**\n* If 5/9 of the games is equal to 15 games, then 1/9 of the games is equal to 15/5 = 3 games.\n* Since there are 9/9 in a whole, the total number of games played is 9 * 3 = **27 games**. \n"
