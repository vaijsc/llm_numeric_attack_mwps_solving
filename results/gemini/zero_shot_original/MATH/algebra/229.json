    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We can see that $2\\clubsuit x = 2^2 + 2\\cdot 2\\cdot x + x^2 = 81$. This becomes a quadratic: $x^2 + 4x - 77 = (x + 11)(x - 7) = 0$. Thus, $x = 7, -11$ and our answer is $\\boxed{-4}$.\n\n- OR -\n\nWe note that $a \\clubsuit b = (a + b)^2$. Thus, $(2 + x)^2 = 81$. It follows that $2 + x = 9$ or $2 + x = -9$, leaving us with $x = 7, -11$. We find that the answer is $\\boxed{-4}$.",
