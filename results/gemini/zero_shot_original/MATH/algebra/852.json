    "solution": "Let the coordinates of $T$ be $(x,y)$. Then, the midpoint of $\\overline{PT}$ is $\\left(\\frac{x+5}{2}, \\frac{y+3}{2}\\right)$.  Since we know the coordinates of this point are those of point $Q$, $(-3,6)$, we have $(x+5)/2 = -3$ and $(y+3)/2 = 6$.  Solving these equations gives $x = -11$ and $y = 9$, so point $T$ is at $\\boxed{(-11,9)}$.",
