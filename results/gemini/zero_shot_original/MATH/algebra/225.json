    "solution": "We tackle this with some careful casework.\n\nCase 1: $x\\ge 2$.  We then have $|x-1| + |x-1.5| + |x-2| = (x-1) + (x-1.5) + (x-2) = 3x - 4.5$.  Since the smallest value of $x$ in this case is $2$, the smallest possible value of the sum in this case is $3(2) - 4.5 = 1.5$.\n\nCase 2: $1.5\\le x < 2$.  We then have  \\begin{align*}\n|x-1| + |x-1.5| + |x-2| & = (x-1) + (x-1.5) + (-(x-2)) \\\\\n& = 2x - 2.5 -x+2 \\\\\n& = x -0.5.\n\\end{align*} Since the smallest possible value of $x$ in this case is $1.5$, the smallest possible value of the sum in this case is $1.5-0.5 = 1$.\n\nCase 3: $1 \\le x < 1.5$.  We then have  \\begin{align*}\n|x-1| + |x-1.5| + |x-2| & = (x-1) - (x-1.5) - (x-2) \\\\\n& = x-1 -x + 1.5-x+2 \\\\\n& = -x +2.5.\n\\end{align*} Since $x$ is less than 1.5, the sum in this case is greater than $-1.5+2.5 = 1$.\n\nCase 4: $x < 1$.  We then have  \\begin{align*}\n|x-1| + |x-1.5| + |x-2| & = -(x-1) - (x-1.5) - (x-2) \\\\\n& = -3x + 4.5.\n\\end{align*} Since $x$ is less than 1, the sum in this case is greater than $-3(1) + 4.5 = 1.5$.\n\nReviewing these cases, we see that the least possible sum is $\\boxed{1}$.  As an extra challenge, see if you can find a quick solution to this problem by thinking about the graph of $y = | x-1| + |x-1.5| + |x-2|$.",

        "Here's how to find the least possible value of the sum:\n**Understanding Absolute Values**\n* **Absolute value represents distance:**  The absolute value of a number is its distance from zero. So, |x - 1| represents the distance between 'x' and 1 on the number line.\n* **Minimizing the sum:**  To minimize the sum, we want to find a value of 'x' that makes the distances between 'x' and each of the numbers 1, 1.5, and 2 as small as possible.\n**Geometric Interpretation**\nThink of the numbers 1, 1.5, and 2 on a number line.  The expression $|x - 1| + |x - 1.5| + |x - 2|$ represents the sum of the distances from 'x' to each of these points.  \n* **The smallest possible sum occurs when 'x' is in the middle:** The best way to minimize the total distance is to place 'x' in the middle of 1 and 2.  This is because the sum of distances from 'x' to 1 and 2 will be the smallest in this case.\n**Solution**\n1. **Find the middle value:** The middle value between 1 and 2 is (1 + 2) / 2 = 1.5\n2. **Substitute and calculate:** \n   * |1.5 - 1| + |1.5 - 1.5| + |1.5 - 2| = 0.5 + 0 + 0.5 = 1\n**Therefore, the least possible value of the sum |x - 1| + |x - 1.5| + |x - 2| is 1.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**Understanding Absolute Values**\nThe absolute value of a number is its distance from zero.  So,  |x - a| represents the distance between the number *x* and the number *a* on the number line.\n**Visualizing the Problem**\nImagine the numbers 1, 1.5, and 2 on a number line. We want to find the value of *x* that minimizes the sum of distances from *x* to each of these numbers.\n**Finding the Minimum**\n* **Case 1:  x < 1** \n   If *x* is less than 1, all three distances will be negative.  The sum will be larger than if *x* were closer to 1.\n* **Case 2: 1 \u2264 x \u2264 1.5**\n   If *x* is between 1 and 1.5,  |x - 1| will be positive, |x - 1.5| will be negative, and |x - 2| will be negative.  The sum will be smaller than in Case 1.\n* **Case 3: 1.5 \u2264 x \u2264 2**\n   If *x* is between 1.5 and 2, |x - 1| and |x - 1.5| will be positive, and |x - 2| will be negative.  The sum will be smaller than in Case 2.\n* **Case 4: x > 2**\n   If *x* is greater than 2, all three distances will be positive. The sum will be larger than in Case 3.\n**Conclusion**\nThe minimum value of the sum occurs when *x* is between 1.5 and 2, where we minimize the distances to 1 and 1.5.  \n**Calculating the Minimum**\nLet's take *x* = 1.5.  Here's the calculation:\n* |1.5 - 1| + |1.5 - 1.5| + |1.5 - 2| = 0.5 + 0 + 0.5 = 1\n**Therefore, the least possible value of the sum |x - 1| + |x - 1.5| + |x - 2| is 1.** \n",

So,  |x| represents the distance of 'x' from zero on the number line.\n**Visualizing the Problem**\nThink about the expression: \n|x - 1| + |x - 1.5| + |x - 2|\nEach term represents the distance of 'x' from 1, 1.5, and 2 respectively. \n**Finding the Minimum**\nTo minimize the sum, we need to find a value of 'x' that makes the distances as small as possible.  The best way to do this is to find the value of 'x' that is in the middle of 1, 1.5, and 2. This is because it will minimize the sum of distances from each of these numbers.\n* The middle value between 1 and 2 is 1.5.\n* The middle value between 1.5 and 2 is 1.75.\nSince 1.75 is between 1.5 and 2, it is also the middle value of all three numbers (1, 1.5, and 2).\n**Calculating the Minimum**\nNow let's calculate the sum when x = 1.75:\n* |1.75 - 1| = 0.75\n* |1.75 - 1.5| = 0.25\n* |1.75 - 2| = 0.25\nTherefore, the least possible value of the sum is 0.75 + 0.25 + 0.25 = **1.25** \n",

Here's why:\n* If *x* is less than 1.5, it will be closer to 1 and 1.5, but farther from 2.
