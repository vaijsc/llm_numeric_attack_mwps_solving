        "Here's how to determine the degree of the polynomial:\n**Understanding Degree**\n* The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of the variable in the polynomial. \n* When adding polynomials, the degree of the resulting polynomial is determined by the highest degree term present.\n**Step-by-Step Explanation**\n1. **f(x) is of degree 3:** This means the highest power of 'x' in f(x) is x\u00b3. \n2. **g(x) is of degree 5:** This means the highest power of 'x' in g(x) is x\u2075.\n3. **2f(x):** Multiplying a polynomial by a constant doesn't change its degree.  So, 2f(x) will still have a term with x\u00b3.\n4. **4g(x):** Similarly, 4g(x) will still have a term with x\u2075.\n5. **2f(x) + 4g(x):** When we add the two polynomials, the term with the highest power will be x\u2075 (from 4g(x)).\n**Conclusion**\nThe degree of the polynomial  2f(x) + 4g(x) is **5**. \n",

        "Here's how to determine the degree of the polynomial:\n**1. Understand Degree:**\n* The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of the variable in the polynomial.\n**2. Consider the Operations:**\n* **Multiplication by a Constant:** Multiplying a polynomial by a constant doesn't change its degree.  For example, 2*x^3 still has a degree of 3.\n* **Addition of Polynomials:** The degree of the sum of polynomials is determined by the highest degree term present in any of the polynomials.\n**3. Apply to the Problem:**\n*  `f(x)` has degree 3, meaning its highest power term is of the form  `ax^3`.\n*  `g(x)` has degree 5, meaning its highest power term is of the form  `bx^5`.\n**4. Determine the Highest Degree Term:**\n* `2f(x)` will also have a highest power term of the form `2ax^3`.\n* `4g(x)` will have a highest power term of the form `4bx^5`.\n**5.  Conclusion:**\nSince `4bx^5` has a higher degree than `2ax^3`, the polynomial `2f(x) + 4g(x)` will have a degree of **5**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Understand the Concept of Degree:**\n* The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of the variable in the polynomial. \n* For example, the polynomial  3x\u00b2 + 5x - 2 has a degree of 2 (because of the x\u00b2 term).\n**2. Analyze the Given Information:**\n*  f(x) is a polynomial of degree 3. This means its highest power term will look like *ax\u00b3* (where 'a' is a constant).\n* g(x) is a polynomial of degree 5. This means its highest power term will look like *bx\u2075* (where 'b' is a constant).\n**3.  Determine the Degree of the Combined Polynomial:**\n* When you multiply a polynomial by a constant (like 2f(x) or 4g(x)), it doesn't change the degree of the polynomial.\n* The highest power term in 2f(x) will be 2 * (ax\u00b3) = 2ax\u00b3.\n* The highest power term in 4g(x) will be 4 * (bx\u2075) = 4bx\u2075.\n**4.  Find the Highest Power Term:**\n* The highest power term in the combined polynomial 2f(x) + 4g(x) will be 4bx\u2075 (because 5 is greater than 3).\n**Conclusion:**\nTherefore, the degree of the polynomial 2f(x) + 4g(x) is **5**. \n",
