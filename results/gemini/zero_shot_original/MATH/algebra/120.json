        "We want to find the exponent that we need to raise 2 to in order to get 64. \n* **Think about powers of 2:**  2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 64\n* **Count the twos:** There are six 2's in the product.\nTherefore, $\\log_2 64 = \\boxed{6}$. \n",
        "We want to find the exponent to which we must raise 2 to get 64.  \nIn other words, we want to find $x$ in the equation:\n$2^x = 64$\nSince $64 = 2^6$, we know that $x = \\boxed{6}$. \n",

        "**1. Understand Logarithms**\nLogarithms answer the question: \"What exponent do I need to raise the base to in order to get a specific number?\"  In this case, we're looking for the exponent we need to raise 2 (the base) to in order to get 64.\n**2. Express 64 as a power of 2**\nWe know that  $2^6 = 64$\n**3. Apply the Logarithmic Rule**\nSince  $2^6 = 64$, then  $\\log_2 64 = \\boxed{6}$. \n",
