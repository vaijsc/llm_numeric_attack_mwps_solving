        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Factor the Denominator**\nThe denominator factors nicely: \n  \n  x\u00b2 + 7x - 44 = (x + 11)(x - 4)\n**2.  Understanding the Condition**\nWe want the given rational function to be equivalent to the quotient of two linear functions.  This means it needs to simplify to the form:\n  (ax + b) / (cx + d)\nwhere a, b, c, and d are constants.\n**3. Partial Fraction Decomposition**\nTo achieve this, we'll use partial fraction decomposition:\n  (x\u00b2 + 5x + \u03b1) / [(x + 11)(x - 4)] = A/(x + 11) + B/(x - 4)\nwhere A and B are constants we need to find.\n**4. Solving for A and B**\n* Multiply both sides by (x + 11)(x - 4): \n  x\u00b2 + 5x + \u03b1 = A(x - 4) + B(x + 11)\n* Expand the right side:\n  x\u00b2 + 5x + \u03b1 = Ax - 4A + Bx + 11B\n* Match coefficients:\n    *  x\u00b2 term: 1 = A + B \n    *  x term: 5 = A + B \n    *  Constant term: \u03b1 = -4A + 11B\n**5. Analysis**\nNotice that the equations for the x\u00b2 and x terms are the same. This means the coefficients of x\u00b2 and x will always match, no matter what the value of \u03b1 is.  The key is the constant term equation:\n  \u03b1 = -4A + 11B\n**6. Finding a Relationship between A and B**\nFrom the equation 1 = A + B, we get A = 1 - B. Substitute this into the constant term equation:\n  \u03b1 = -4(1 - B) + 11B\n  \u03b1 = -4 + 4B + 11B\n  \u03b1 = -4 + 15B\n**7.  The Solution**\nFor the rational function to be a quotient of two linear functions, the constant term equation must have a solution for B (and therefore for A). Since the coefficient of B is 15, there will always be a solution for B, regardless of the value of \u03b1.\n**8. The Set S**\nThis means the set S is the set of all real numbers. \n**9.  Sum of Elements**\nThe sum of all real numbers is **undefined** or **infinity**. \n",
        "Here's a step-by-step solution:\n**1. Factor the quadratic in the denominator:**\nThe denominator factors as $(x+11)(x-4)$.\n**2. Consider the possible forms of the linear functions:**\nFor the given rational function to be expressible as a quotient of two linear functions, the numerator must also factor.  Let's assume the factorization of the numerator is $(x+a)(x+b)$.  Then, we have:\n$$\\frac{x^2+5x+\\alpha}{(x+11)(x-4)} = \\frac{(x+a)(x+b)}{(x+11)(x-4)}$$\n**3.  Match coefficients:**\nExpanding the numerator on the right side gives us:\n$$x^2 + (a+b)x + ab$$\nFor this to be equal to the numerator on the left side, we must have:\n*  $a+b = 5$\n*  $ab = \\alpha$\n**4. Solve for \u03b1:**\nFrom the first equation, we have $b = 5-a$. Substituting this into the second equation, we get:\n$$a(5-a) = \\alpha$$\nExpanding, we have:\n$$\\alpha = 5a - a^2$$\n**5. Determine the values of \u03b1 that satisfy the conditions:**\nFor the original expression to be a quotient of linear functions, the quadratic in the numerator must factor, which means the quadratic equation  $\\alpha = 5a - a^2$ must have integer solutions for *a*.  We can find these integer solutions by factoring the quadratic:\n$$a^2 - 5a + \\alpha = 0$$\nThis quadratic factors if and only if its discriminant is a perfect square.  The discriminant is:\n$$(-5)^2 - 4 \\alpha = 25 - 4 \\alpha$$\nWe need to find the values of $\\alpha$ that make $25 - 4\\alpha$ a perfect square.  The possible perfect squares less than 25 are 0, 1, 4, 9, 16.  Testing these values, we find that:\n* If $25 - 4 \\alpha = 0$, then $\\alpha = \\frac{25}{4}$, which is not an integer.\n* If $25 - 4 \\alpha = 1$, then $\\alpha = 6$.\n* If $25 - 4 \\alpha = 4$, then $\\alpha = \\frac{21}{4}$, which is not an integer.\n* If $25 - 4 \\alpha = 9$, then $\\alpha = 4$.\n* If $25 - 4 \\alpha = 16$, then $\\alpha = \\frac{9}{4}$, which is not an integer.\nTherefore, the only possible values for $\\alpha$ are 6 and 4.\n**6. Find the sum of the elements of S:**\nThe set $S$ contains the values 6 and 4, so the sum of its elements is $6 + 4 = \\boxed{10}$. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Factor the denominator:**\nThe denominator factors as $(x+11)(x-4)$.\n**2. Consider the cases:**\nFor the given function to be expressed as a quotient of two linear functions, the numerator must also factor, and one of the factors must either cancel with $(x+11)$ or $(x-4)$.  Let's consider the cases:\n* **Case 1:  The numerator factors as $(x+11)(x+b)$**\n   In this case, the function simplifies to $\\frac{x+b}{x-4}$, which is a quotient of two linear functions.  Expanding the numerator, we get $x^2 + (b+11)x + 11b$.  Matching coefficients with the original numerator, we have $b+11=5$ and $11b=\\alpha$.  Solving, we find $b=-6$ and $\\alpha = -66$.\n* **Case 2:  The numerator factors as $(x-4)(x+b)$**\n   In this case, the function simplifies to $\\frac{x+b}{x+11}$, which is a quotient of two linear functions. Expanding the numerator, we get $x^2 + (b-4)x - 4b$.  Matching coefficients with the original numerator, we have $b-4=5$ and $-4b=\\alpha$.  Solving, we find $b=9$ and $\\alpha = -36$.\n**3. The solution:**\nThe set $S$ contains the values $\\alpha = -66$ and $\\alpha = -36$.  Therefore, the sum of the elements of $S$ is $-66 + (-36) = \\boxed{-102}$. \n",

This means either $p = 11$ or $p = -4$.\n**4. Solve for \u03b1:**\n* **Case 1:  p = 11**\n   If $p = 11$, then the numerator becomes:\n   $$(x + 11)(x + q) = x^2 + (11 + q)x + 11q$$\n   Matching this with the original numerator, we have:\n   $$11 + q = 5$$\n   $$11q = \\alpha$$\n   Solving this system, we get $q = -6$ and $\\alpha = -66$.\n* **Case 2: p = -4**\n   If $p = -4$, then the numerator becomes:\n   $$(x - 4)(x + q) = x^2 + (q - 4)x - 4q$$\n   Matching this with the original numerator, we have:\n   $$q - 4 = 5$$\n   $$-4q = \\alpha$$\n   Solving this system, we get $q = 9$ and $\\alpha = -36$.\n**5.

Consider the Conditions for a Linear Quotient**\nFor the function to be expressible as a quotient of two linear functions, the numerator must also factor into two linear expressions. In other words, we need to find values of  \u03b1  that make the quadratic in the numerator factorable.\n**3. Apply the Discriminant**\nA quadratic expression ax\u00b2 + bx + c  is factorable if and only if its discriminant, b\u00b2 - 4ac, is a perfect square.  Let's apply this to the numerator:\n* a = 1\n* b = 5\n* c = \u03b1\nThe discriminant is 5\u00b2 - 4(1)(\u03b1) = 25 - 4\u03b1. \n**4. Solve for \u03b1**\nWe want 25 - 4\u03b1 to be a perfect square.

Notice that as the perfect square increases, the value of \u03b1 decreases. \n**5. Analyze the Solutions**\nWe need to be careful.  If the numerator factors, it's possible that one of the linear factors cancels with a factor in the denominator, leading to a simplified expression that is not a quotient of two linear functions. \nLet's examine each case:\n* **\u03b1 = 25/4:** The numerator becomes (x + 5/2)\u00b2 and cancels with the denominator, resulting in a simplified expression that's not linear. \n* **\u03b1 = 6:** The numerator becomes (x + 2)(x + 3) and doesn't cancel completely with the denominator, resulting in a linear quotient.\n* **\u03b1 = 21/4:** The numerator becomes (x + 7/2)\u00b2 and cancels with the denominator, resulting in a simplified expression that's not linear.\n* **\u03b1 = 4:** The numerator becomes (x + 1)(x + 4) and cancels partially with the denominator, resulting in a linear quotient.\n* **\u03b1 = 9/4:** The numerator becomes (x + 3/2)\u00b2 and cancels with the denominator, resulting in a simplified expression that's not linear.\n* **\u03b1 = 0:** The numerator becomes x(x + 5) and doesn't cancel completely with the denominator, resulting in a linear quotient.\n* **\u03b1 = -11/4:** The numerator becomes (x - 1/2)\u00b2 and cancels with the denominator, resulting in a simplified expression that's not linear.\n**6.
