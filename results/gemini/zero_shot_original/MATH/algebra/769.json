        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Domain Restrictions**\n* **f(x):** The function  f(x) = 1/(x-3) is undefined when the denominator is zero, which occurs at x = 3. So, the domain of f(x) is all real numbers except for x = 3. \n* **g(x) = f(f(x)):**  The function g(x) is defined as f(f(x)). This means we're applying the function f twice.  To find the domain of g(x), we need to consider two things:\n    *  **Inner f(x):** The input to the outer f(x) must be in the domain of f(x). This means f(x) cannot equal 3.\n    * **Outer f(x):** The output of the inner f(x) must also be in the domain of f(x), meaning it cannot equal 3.\n**2. Find the Value Where f(x) = 3**\n*  We need to solve the equation: \n   ```\n   f(x) = 1/(x-3) = 3\n   ```\n   Multiplying both sides by (x-3) gives: 1 = 3(x-3)\n   Simplifying: 1 = 3x - 9\n   Solving for x: 10 = 3x  \n   Therefore, x = 10/3\n**3. Find the Value Where f(f(x)) = 3**\n*  Now, we need to find the value of x where:\n    ```\n    f(f(x)) = 1/[f(x) - 3] = 3\n    ```\n    This is similar to the previous step.  Multiplying both sides by [f(x) - 3]: 1 = 3[f(x) - 3]\n    Simplifying: 1 = 3f(x) - 9\n    Solving for f(x): 10 = 3f(x)\n    Therefore, f(x) = 10/3\n* Now we need to find the x value that makes f(x) = 10/3:\n   ```\n   1/(x-3) = 10/3\n   ```\n   Cross-multiplying: 3 = 10(x-3)\n   Simplifying: 3 = 10x - 30\n   Solving for x: 33 = 10x\n   Therefore, x = 33/10\n**4. Determine the Largest Value Excluded**\n* We found two values that make g(x) undefined: x = 10/3 and x = 33/10. \n* The larger of these two values is x = **33/10**.\n**Answer:** The largest value of x not in the domain of g(x) is x = **33/10**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the domain restrictions of f(x):**\n* The function  *f(x) = 1/(x-3)* is a rational function.  Rational functions are undefined when the denominator is zero. \n* Therefore, *f(x)* is undefined when *x = 3*. This means the domain of *f(x)* is all real numbers except for 3.\n**2. Understand the composition g(x) = f(f(x)):**\n* The composition *g(x)* means we're plugging the entire function *f(x)* into itself. \n* So, *g(x) = f(f(x)) = 1/((1/(x-3)) - 3)*\n**3. Find the domain restrictions of g(x):**\n* *g(x)* will be undefined in two cases:\n    * **Case 1: When the inner *f(x)* is undefined:** This happens when *x = 3* (from step 1).\n    * **Case 2: When the denominator of the outer *f(x)* is zero:** This means:\n        * 1/(x-3) - 3 = 0\n        * 1/(x-3) = 3\n        * 1 = 3(x-3)\n        * 1 = 3x - 9\n        * 10 = 3x\n        * x = 10/3\n**4. Determine the largest value of x not in the domain:**\n* We found two values of *x* that make *g(x)* undefined: *x = 3* and *x = 10/3*. \n* The larger of these two values is *x = 10/3*.\n**Answer:** The largest *x* that is not in the domain of *g(x) = f(f(x))* is **x = 10/3**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Domain of *f(x)***\nThe function *f(x) = 1/(x-3)* is undefined when the denominator is zero.  This occurs when *x = 3*.  Therefore, the domain of *f(x)* is all real numbers except for *x = 3*.\n**2. Understand the Composition *g(x) = f(f(x))* **\nThe function *g(x)* is formed by composing *f(x)* with itself. This means we take the output of *f(x)* and plug it back into *f(x)*. \n**3.  Find the Values Where *g(x)* is Undefined**\n* **Step 1:**  *f(x)* is undefined when *x = 3*.  \n* **Step 2:**  We need to find the values of *x* that make the output of *f(x)* equal to 3, because those values will make *f(f(x))* undefined.  \n* **Step 3:**  Set *f(x) = 3* and solve for *x*:\n   \n   ```\n   1/(x-3) = 3\n   1 = 3(x-3)\n   1 = 3x - 9\n   10 = 3x\n   x = 10/3\n   ```\n**4. Determine the Largest Value Not in the Domain**\nWe've found that *g(x)* is undefined when *x = 10/3*.  Since the domain of *f(x)* also excludes *x = 3*, the largest value of *x* not in the domain of *g(x)* is **x = 10/3**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Domain Restrictions**\n* **f(x):** The function f(x) = 1/(x-3) is undefined when the denominator is zero. This occurs when x = 3.  Therefore, the domain of f(x) is all real numbers *except* x = 3.\n* **g(x):** The function g(x) = f(f(x)) is a composition of functions.  To find its domain, we need to consider the restrictions on both f(x) and the inner function f(x) itself.\n**2. Find the Restrictions on the Inner Function**\n* The inner function, f(x),  is defined everywhere except x = 3. This means the output of the inner function, f(x), can never be 3.\n**3. Find the Restrictions on the Outer Function**\n* The outer function, f(f(x)), is defined everywhere except when its input is 3.  Since the inner function, f(x), can never equal 3, the outer function f(f(x)) is defined for all values of x.\n**4. Determine the Largest Value Not in the Domain**\n* Since the inner function, f(x),  is undefined at x = 3, this is the only value that is not in the domain of g(x).\n**Therefore, the largest x that is not in the domain of g(x) is x = 3.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\n* **Domain:** The domain of a function is the set of all possible input values (x-values) for which the function is defined. \n* **Function Composition:**  The expression  `g(x) = f(f(x))` means we're applying the function `f` twice.  First, we find `f(x)`, then we use that output as the input for `f` again.\n**2. Identifying Restrictions in the Domain of f(x)**\n* The function `f(x) = 1/(x-3)` is undefined when the denominator is zero. \n* This happens when `x - 3 = 0`, which means `x = 3`.\n**3. Finding Restrictions in the Domain of g(x)**\n*  We want to find the values of `x` that cause `g(x) = f(f(x))` to be undefined.\n*  `f(f(x))`  will be undefined if:\n    *  `f(x)` is undefined (which we know happens when `x = 3`) \n    *  `f(x)` produces an output that makes the *second* application of `f` undefined (meaning `f(x)` equals 3).\n**4. Solving for x**\n* Let's find the values of `x` that make `f(x) = 3`:\n   *  `1/(x-3) = 3`\n   *  `1 = 3(x-3)`\n   *  `1 = 3x - 9`\n   *  `10 = 3x`\n   *  `x = 10/3`\n**5. Determining the Largest Value**\n* We found two values of `x` that cause problems for `g(x)`: \n    * `x = 3`\n    * `x = 10/3`\n* The larger of these two values is `x = 10/3`.\n**Answer:**  The largest value of `x` that is not in the domain of `g(x) = f(f(x))` is **x = 10/3**. \n"
