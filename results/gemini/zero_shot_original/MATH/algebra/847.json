        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Relationship**\n* The graph shows a linear relationship between time (x) and distance (y). This means the distance increases at a constant rate as time passes. \n* The point (20, 30) tells us that after 20 seconds, Caroline has walked 30 meters.\n**2. Find the Slope**\n* The slope of a line represents the rate of change. In this case, it represents the meters Caroline walks per second.\n*  We can find the slope using the formula:  slope = (change in y) / (change in x)\n* Using the point (20, 30) and the origin (0, 0), the slope is: (30 - 0) / (20 - 0) = 30/20 = 1.5 meters per second.\n**3. Convert Time to Seconds**\n* One hour is equal to 60 minutes, and each minute has 60 seconds. So, one hour is 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds.\n**4. Calculate Total Distance**\n* Since Caroline walks 1.5 meters per second, in 3600 seconds she will walk: 1.5 meters/second * 3600 seconds = 5400 meters.\n**Answer:** Caroline will walk **5400 meters** in one hour. \n",

Find the slope of the line:**\n* The slope represents the distance Caroline walks per second.\n* We are given the point (20, 30), which means after 20 seconds, she walks 30 meters. \n* The slope is the change in distance (y) divided by the change in time (x):  (30 - 0) / (20 - 0) = 30/20 = 1.5 meters per second.\n**2. Calculate the total distance in one hour:**\n* One hour has 60 minutes, and each minute has 60 seconds, so one hour has 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds.\n*  Caroline walks 1.5 meters per second, so in 3600 seconds, she'll walk 1.5 * 3600 = 5400 meters.\n**Answer:** Caroline will walk **5400 meters** in one hour. \n",
