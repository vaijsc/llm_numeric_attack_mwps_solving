        "Here's how to expand $(x+3)(2x-6)$ step-by-step:\n**1.  FOIL Method**\nThe FOIL method helps us remember to multiply each term in the first binomial by each term in the second binomial:\n* **F**irst:  Multiply the first terms of each binomial:  x * 2x = 2x\u00b2\n* **O**uter: Multiply the outer terms of the binomials: x * -6 = -6x\n* **I**nner: Multiply the inner terms of the binomials: 3 * 2x = 6x\n* **L**ast: Multiply the last terms of each binomial: 3 * -6 = -18\n**2. Combine Like Terms**\nNow we have: 2x\u00b2 - 6x + 6x - 18\nCombine the 'x' terms: 2x\u00b2 + 0x - 18\n**3. Simplify**\nThe final expanded form is: **2x\u00b2 - 18** \n",
        "Here's how to expand $(x+3)(2x-6)$ step by step:\n**1. Distribute:**\n*  We'll distribute the 'x' from the first parenthesis to both terms in the second parenthesis:\n   *  x * 2x = 2x\u00b2\n   *  x * -6 = -6x\n* Now, distribute the '3' from the first parenthesis to both terms in the second parenthesis:\n   * 3 * 2x = 6x\n   * 3 * -6 = -18\n**2. Combine Like Terms:**\n* We'll combine the 'x' terms: -6x + 6x = 0\n**3. Write the Final Expression:**\n* The expanded form is: 2x\u00b2 + 0 - 18 \n* Simplified: **2x\u00b2 - 18** \n",
