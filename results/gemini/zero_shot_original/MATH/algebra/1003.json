    "solution": "We have $x$ in the domain of $f(x)$ as long as the denominator, $(3x-9)(3x+6)$, is nonzero. This is true for all $x$ except the solutions to the equations $3x-9=0$ and $3x+6=0$. These solutions are $x=3$ and $x=-2$, respectively.\n\nTherefore, the domain of $f(x)$ is all real numbers except $3$ and $-2$. Expressed as a union of intervals, the domain is $\\boxed{(-\\infty,-2)\\cup (-2,3)\\cup (3,\\infty)}$.",

        "The domain of a rational function is all real numbers except for the values that make the denominator zero. So, we need to find the values of $x$ that make the denominator, $(3x-9)(3x+6)$, equal to zero.\n**Step 1: Factor the denominator.**\nThe denominator factors as $(3x-9)(3x+6) = 3(x-3)(3)(x+2) = 9(x-3)(x+2)$.\n**Step 2: Find the values that make the denominator zero.**\nThe denominator is zero when either $x-3=0$ or $x+2=0$.
