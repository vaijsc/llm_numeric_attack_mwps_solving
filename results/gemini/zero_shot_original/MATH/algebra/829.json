    "solution": "Since $81 = 3^4$, then $3 = 81^{1/4}$. Comparing exponents, it follows that we have the system of equations \\begin{align*}\nx+y &= 4 \\\\\nx -y &= 1/4.\n\\end{align*} Summing the two equations yields that $2x = 4+1/4 = 17/4$, so $x = 17/8$. Subtracting the two equations yields that $2y = 4-1/4 = 15/4$, so $y = 15/8$. Thus, $xy = \\frac{17}{8} \\cdot \\frac{15}{8} = \\boxed{\\frac{255}{64}}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Express everything in terms of base 3:**\n*  Since 81 is 3 raised to the fourth power (81 = 3\u2074), we can rewrite the equations:\n    *  3^(x+y) = 3\u2074\n    *  (3\u2074)^(x-y) = 3\u00b9 \n**2. Simplify using exponent rules:**\n*  Remember that (a^m)^n = a^(m*n).  Applying this to the second equation:\n    *  3^(4(x-y)) = 3\u00b9\n**3. Solve for x and y:**\n*  For the equations to be true, the exponents on both sides must be equal.  This gives us two equations:\n    *  x + y = 4\n    *  4(x - y) = 1\n*  Solve the second equation for x: \n    *  4x - 4y = 1\n    *  4x = 1 + 4y\n    *  x = (1 + 4y)/4\n*  Substitute this value of x into the first equation:\n    *  (1 + 4y)/4 + y = 4\n    *  1 + 4y + 4y = 16\n    *  8y = 15\n    *  y = 15/8\n*  Substitute the value of y back into the equation for x:\n    *  x = (1 + 4(15/8))/4\n    *  x = (1 + 7.5)/4\n    *  x = 8.5/4 \n    *  x = 17/8\n**4. Calculate xy:**\n*  xy = (17/8) * (15/8) = **255/64** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Express everything in terms of the same base:**\n*  Since 81 is a power of 3 ($81=3^4$), we can rewrite the equations:\n    *  $3^{x+y} = 3^4$\n    *  $(3^4)^{x-y} = 3^1$ \n**2.

Calculate the product xy:**\n*  $xy = \\left(\\frac{17}{8}\\right) \\left(\\frac{15}{8}\\right) = \\boxed{\\frac{255}{64}}$ \n",
