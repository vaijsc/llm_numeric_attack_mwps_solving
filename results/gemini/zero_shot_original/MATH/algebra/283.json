    "solution": "Translating words into math, we have the equations \\begin{align*}\na+b+c&=88\\\\\na-5&=N\\\\\nb+5&=N\\\\\n5c&=N\\\\\n\\end{align*} We will express the value of each of $a$, $b$, and $c$ in terms of $N$ and then substitute these equations into the first given equation to solve for $N$. From the second given equation, we have $a=N+5$. From the third given equation, we have $b=N-5$. From the fourth given equation, we have $c=N/5$. Plugging these equations into the first given equation to eliminate $a$, $b$, and $c$, we have $(N+5)+(N-5)+(N/5)=88\\Rightarrow N=\\boxed{40}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step by step:\n**1. Set up equations:**\n*  We know  a + b + c = 88 \n*  We also know:\n    * a - 5 = N\n    * b + 5 = N\n    * c * 5 = N\n**2.  Solve for a, b, and c in terms of N:**\n* From the equations above, we can isolate each variable:\n    * a = N + 5\n    * b = N - 5\n    * c = N/5\n**3. Substitute into the first equation:**\n* Substitute the expressions for a, b, and c from step 2 into the equation a + b + c = 88:\n   (N + 5) + (N - 5) + (N/5) = 88\n**4. Simplify and solve for N:**\n* Combine like terms: 2N + N/5 = 88\n* Multiply both sides by 5 to get rid of the fraction: 10N + N = 440\n* Combine like terms: 11N = 440\n* Divide both sides by 11: N = 40\n**Therefore, the value of N is 40.** \n",
