        "1. **Cross-multiply:** To get rid of the fractions, we can cross-multiply. This means multiplying the numerator of the left side by the denominator of the right side, and vice versa. This gives us:\n   \n   (1)(x+1) = (2)(3x-1)\n2. **Simplify:** Expanding both sides of the equation, we get:\n   x + 1 = 6x - 2\n3. **Solve for x:**  Now we can solve for x by isolating it on one side of the equation. First, subtract x from both sides:\n   1 = 5x - 2\n   Then, add 2 to both sides:\n   3 = 5x\n   Finally, divide both sides by 5:\n   x = **3/5**\nTherefore, the value of x that satisfies the equation is **x = 3/5**. \n",
