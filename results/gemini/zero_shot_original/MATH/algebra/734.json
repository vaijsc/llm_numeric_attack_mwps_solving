    "solution": "The three-digit number $abc$ is maximized when $a$ is maximized, and $a$ is maximized when $b$ is maximized, since 4, $a$, $b$ is a geometric sequence.  The largest digit is 9, so we'd like to find a digit $a$ such that 4, $a$, 9 is a geometric sequence.  The condition that 4, $a$, 9 is a geometric sequence is equivalent to $\\frac{9}{a}=\\frac{a}{4}$, which by clearing denominators is equivalent to $36=a^2$, which has solutions $a=\\pm 6$.  One of these solutions is a digit, so $a=6$ and $b=9$ are the maximum values of $a$ and $b$.  If $b$, $c$, 5 is an arithmetic sequence, then the $c$ equals the average of $b$ and $5$, which is $(9+5)/2=7$.  So, $abc=\\boxed{697}$.",

        "Here's how we can solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understanding Geometric and Arithmetic Sequences**\n* **Geometric sequence:**  Each term is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant factor (called the common ratio).\n* **Arithmetic sequence:** Each term is found by adding a constant value (called the common difference) to the previous term.\n**2. Setting up Equations**\n* **Geometric sequence:** Since 4, a, and b form a geometric sequence, we have:\n   * a = 4r (where r is the common ratio)\n   * b = ar = 4r\u00b2\n* **Arithmetic sequence:** Since b, c, and 5 form an arithmetic sequence, we have:\n   * c = b + d (where d is the common difference)\n   * 5 = c + d  \n**3. Solving for the Variables**\n* **Eliminate 'c'**:  Substitute the first equation for 'c' into the second equation:\n   * 5 = (b + d) + d\n   * 5 = b + 2d\n* **Express 'b' in terms of 'r'**:  Substitute the expression for 'b' from the geometric sequence:\n   * 5 = 4r\u00b2 + 2d\n* **Express 'd' in terms of 'r'**:  Solve for 'd':\n   * 2d = 5 - 4r\u00b2\n   * d = (5 - 4r\u00b2)/2\n* **Find 'r'**:  Since we want the greatest possible three-digit number, we want 'r' to be as large as possible.  Notice that as 'r' increases, 'd' becomes negative (because of the -4r\u00b2 term). To maximize 'a' and 'b', we need to find the largest value of 'r' that still results in a positive 'd'.  \n   *  Let's try a few values of 'r':\n      * If r = 2, then d = (5 - 4(2\u00b2))/2 = -7/2 (not positive)\n      * If r = 1.5, then d = (5 - 4(1.5\u00b2))/2 = -1/2 (not positive)\n      * If r = 1.25, then d = (5 - 4(1.25\u00b2))/2 = 1/8 (positive!)\n* **Calculate 'a', 'b', and 'c'**:  Using r = 1.25:\n   * a = 4r = 5\n   * b = 4r\u00b2 = 6.25\n   * c = b + d = 6.25 + 1/8 = 51/8\n**4. The Greatest Three-Digit Number**\nSince 'c' is not an integer, we need to round it down to the nearest integer to get the greatest three-digit number. Therefore, the greatest three-digit number \"abc\" is **566**. \n",

Understand Geometric and Arithmetic Sequences**\n* **Geometric Sequence:**  Each term is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant factor called the common ratio.\n* **Arithmetic Sequence:** Each term is found by adding a constant difference to the previous term.\n**2. Set up Equations**\n* **Geometric Sequence:**  Since 4, a, and b form a geometric sequence, we have the relationship: \n   a/4 = b/a \n* **Arithmetic Sequence:** Since b, c, and 5 form an arithmetic sequence, we have the relationship:\n   c - b = 5 - c\n**3.

Express c in terms of b**\n* From the arithmetic sequence equation, we have:\n   c = (b + 5)/2\n**5. Substitute c into the geometric sequence equation**\n* We know a\u00b2 = 4b.  Substitute c into the arithmetic sequence equation to get:\n    (b + 5)/2 - b = 5 - (b + 5)/2\n* Simplify the equation:\n    b + 5 - 2b = 10 - b - 5\n* Solve for b:\n    b = 0\n**6. Find a and c**\n* Substitute b = 0 into the equation a\u00b2 = 4b:\n   a\u00b2 = 4 * 0 \n   a = 0 \n* Substitute b = 0 into the equation c = (b + 5)/2:\n   c = (0 + 5)/2\n   c = 5/2\n**7.  The Problem**\nWe have found that b = 0, a = 0, and c = 5/2.  However, we need a three-digit number \"abc\".  Since a and b are both 0, the number \"abc\" would be 005, which is not a three-digit number.\n**Conclusion:**\nThere is no three-digit number \"abc\" that satisfies the given conditions. \n",
