        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Set up equations:**\n* Let 'x' be the larger number.\n* Let 'y' be the smaller number.\nWe are given:\n* x + y = 25  (The sum of the two numbers is 25)\n* x - y = 11  (The difference of the two numbers is 11)\n**2. Solve for x (the larger number):**\n* **Add the two equations together:** \n   (x + y) + (x - y) = 25 + 11\n* **Simplify:**\n   2x = 36\n* **Divide both sides by 2:**\n   x = 18\n**Therefore, the larger of the two numbers is 18.** \n",
