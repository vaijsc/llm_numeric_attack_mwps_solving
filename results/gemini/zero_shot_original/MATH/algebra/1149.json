Then Charles's discriminant is $(4)^2-4(1)(c)=16-4c$, and Eric's discriminant is $(4)^2-4(1)(d)=16-4d$.

        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Set up the quadratics:**\n* Eric's quadratic:  $x^2 + 4x + e$ \n* Charles's quadratic: $x^2 + 4x + c$\n**2. Calculate the discriminants:**\n* Eric's discriminant:  $b^2 - 4ac = 4^2 - 4(1)(e) = 16 - 4e$\n* Charles's discriminant: $b^2 - 4ac = 4^2 - 4(1)(c) = 16 - 4c$\n**3. Express the given ratio:**\nWe're told the ratio of Eric's discriminant to Charles's discriminant is equal to the ratio of Charles's constant term to Eric's constant term. This translates to:\n  (16 - 4e) / (16 - 4c) = c / e\n**4. Simplify the equation:**\nCross-multiply to get: \n  e(16 - 4c) = c(16 - 4e)\nExpand:\n  16e - 4ce = 16c - 4ce\nSimplify:\n  16e = 16c\nDivide by 16:\n  e = c\n**5. The contradiction:**\nWe arrive at the conclusion that e = c. This contradicts the initial condition that their constant terms are not equal.\n**Conclusion:**\nThere is no solution to this problem.  The given conditions are impossible. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Set up the polynomials:**\n* Let Eric's polynomial be  $x^2 + 4x + E$ \n* Let Charles's polynomial be $x^2 + 4x + C$\n**2. Calculate the discriminants:**\n* Discriminant of Eric's polynomial:  $4^2 - 4(1)(E) = 16 - 4E$\n* Discriminant of Charles's polynomial: $4^2 - 4(1)(C) = 16 - 4C$\n**3. Express the given ratio:**\nWe are told:  \n(Discriminant of Eric's polynomial) / (Discriminant of Charles's polynomial) = (Charles's constant term) / (Eric's constant term)\nThis translates to:\n$(16-4E) / (16-4C) = C/E$\n**4. Simplify and solve:**\nCross-multiplying the equation, we get: \n$E(16 - 4C) = C(16 - 4E)$\nExpanding:\n$16E - 4CE = 16C - 4CE$\nSimplifying:\n$16E = 16C$\nDividing both sides by 16:\n$E = C$\n**5. Contradiction and Conclusion:**\nWe have arrived at a contradiction because the problem states that the constant terms are *not* equal. This means our initial assumption about the ratio being true must be incorrect.  \nTherefore, there is **no solution** that satisfies the given conditions.  There is no way to find the sum of the constant terms because the problem is logically inconsistent. \n",
