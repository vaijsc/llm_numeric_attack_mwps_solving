Arithmetic Series**\nThe numbers from -25 to 'n' form an arithmetic series.

Understand the Problem:**\nWe need to find the smallest integer 'n' such that the sum of all integers from -25 to 'n' is greater than or equal to 26.\n**2.

Finding the Smallest Integer:**\nSince we are looking for the smallest integer 'n' that satisfies the condition, the answer is **n = -1**.\n**7. Verification:**\nLet's check if the sum of integers from -25 to -1 is at least 26:\n* Sum = -25 + (-24) + ... + (-2) + (-1) = -325 \nThis doesn't satisfy the condition. However, if we include 0, the sum becomes:\n* Sum = -25 + (-24) + ... + (-2) + (-1) + 0 = -325 + 0 = -325 \nStill not greater than or equal to 26.
