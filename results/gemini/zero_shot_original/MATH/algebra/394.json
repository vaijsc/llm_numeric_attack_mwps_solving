This gives us two equations:\n   * *a*/6 = *b*/a \n   * *ab* = 54/*a*\n2. **Solve for *b* in terms of *a*:**  From the first equation, we can solve for *b*:\n   * *a*\u00b2 = 6*b*\n   * *b* = *a*\u00b2 / 6\n3. **Substitute *b* into the second equation:** Substitute the expression for *b* into the second equation:\n   * *a* (*a*\u00b2 / 6) = 54/*a*\n   * *a*\u2074 = 324\n4. **Solve for *a*:**\n   * *a*\u2074 = 324\n   * *a* = \u00b3\u221a324 = **6** \n**Therefore, the value of *a* is 6.** \n",

Set up Equations**\n* In the first sequence (6, a, b), the common ratio is a/6 = b/a.\n* In the second sequence (1/b, a, 54), the common ratio is a/(1/b) = 54/a.\n**3. Solve for b**\nSince both sequences have the same middle term *a*, their common ratios are equal.  Let's set the two common ratio expressions equal to each other:\n   a/6 = b/a = a/(1/b) = 54/a\n   From the first and last parts of this equation, we get:\n   a/6 = 54/a\n   Cross-multiplying gives:\n   a\u00b2 = 324\n   Taking the square root of both sides (we only want positive values):\n   a = 18\n**Therefore, a = 18** \n",

This suggests that the common ratio for the second sequence (*r<sub>2</sub>*) is 9 times the common ratio for the first sequence (*r<sub>1</sub>*).\n* Therefore,  *r<sub>2</sub>* = 9 * *r<sub>1</sub>*\n**6. Substitute and Solve**\n* Substitute *r<sub>2</sub>* = 9 * *r<sub>1</sub>* into the equation *a*\u00b2 * *r<sub>1</sub>* = *r<sub>2</sub>*:  *a*\u00b2 * *r<sub>1</sub>* = 9 * *r<sub>1</sub>*\n* Divide both sides by *r<sub>1</sub>* (since *r<sub>1</sub>* is positive, we can divide):  *a*\u00b2 = 9\n* Take the square root of both sides:  *a* = 3\n**Solution**\nTherefore, *a* = **3**. \n",
