        "Here's a step-by-step solution:\n**1. Understanding the Condition**\nThe condition $f(f(x)) = x$ means that if you apply the function $f$ twice to any input $x$, you get back the original input. This is the defining property of an inverse function.\n**2. Finding the Inverse**\nLet's find the inverse of each piece of the function separately:\n* **For  x \u2264 3:**  Let $y = 9 - 2x$. Solving for $x$, we get $x = \\frac{9 - y}{2}$. \n* **For x > 3:** Let $y = ax + b$. Solving for $x$, we get $x = \\frac{y - b}{a}$.\n**3. Matching the Pieces**\nSince $f(f(x)) = x$, the inverse function must match the original function. This gives us two cases:\n* **Case 1:  x \u2264 3**  The inverse of the first piece should match the second piece when  $x > 3$.  This means:\n   *  $\\frac{9 - y}{2} = ay + b$  for $y > 3$.  Since we want the inverse to work for all $y$, this equation must hold for all values of $y$.\n* **Case 2: x > 3** The inverse of the second piece should match the first piece when $x \u2264 3$. This means:\n    *  $\\frac{y - b}{a} = 9 - 2y$  for $y \u2264 3$.  Again, this equation must hold for all values of $y$.\n**4. Solving the Equations**\nLet's focus on Case 1 (the equation for $y > 3$):\n* $\\frac{9 - y}{2} = ay + b$\n* Multiply both sides by 2: $9 - y = 2ay + 2b$\n* Rearrange: $2ay + y = 9 - 2b$\n* Factor out $y$: $y(2a + 1) = 9 - 2b$\nSince this equation must hold for all $y > 3$, the coefficient of $y$ must be zero:\n* $2a + 1 = 0$  \n* Solving for $a$, we get $a = -\\frac{1}{2}$\nNow, substitute this value of $a$ back into the equation:\n* $y(2(-\\frac{1}{2}) + 1) = 9 - 2b$\n* $0 = 9 - 2b$\n* Solving for $b$, we get $b = \\frac{9}{2}$.\n**5. Calculating a + b**\nFinally, we can calculate  $a + b$:\n* $a + b = -\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{9}{2} = \\boxed{4}$ \n",
        "Here's a step-by-step solution to find the values of $a$ and $b$:\n**1.  Understanding the Condition:**\nThe condition $f(f(x)) = x$ for all $x$ means that the function is its own inverse.  In other words, if we apply the function twice, we get back to the original input.\n**2.  Casework:**\nWe need to consider two cases:\n* **Case 1:  $x \\le 3$**\n   In this case,  $f(x) = 9 - 2x$.  Since $9 - 2x \\le 3$ when $x \\ge 3$, we have \n   \\[f(f(x)) = f(9 - 2x) = 9 - 2(9 - 2x) = 4x - 9.\\]We want this to be equal to $x$, so $4x - 9 = x$.  Solving, we find $x = 3$. This means that the condition $f(f(x)) = x$ holds for all $x \\le 3$.\n* **Case 2:  $x > 3$**\n   In this case, $f(x) = ax + b$.  We need to consider two subcases:\n     * **Subcase 2a: $ax + b \\le 3$** \n       Then \n       \\[f(f(x)) = f(ax + b) = 9 - 2(ax + b) = 9 - 2ax - 2b.\\]We want this to be equal to $x$, so $9 - 2ax - 2b = x$.  This equation must hold for all $x > 3$.  Since the left side is linear and the right side is linear, the coefficients must match.  This means $-2a = 1$ and $-2b + 9 = 0$.  Solving, we get $a = -\\frac{1}{2}$ and $b = \\frac{9}{2}$.\n     * **Subcase 2b: $ax + b > 3$**\n       Then \n       \\[f(f(x)) = f(ax + b) = a(ax + b) + b = a^2 x + ab + b.\\]We want this to be equal to $x$, so $a^2 x + ab + b = x$.  This equation must hold for all $x > 3$.  Matching coefficients, we get $a^2 = 1$ and $ab + b = 0$.  If $a = 1$, then $b = 0$, and if $a = -1$, then $b = 0$.  In either case, the condition $f(f(x)) = x$ holds for all $x > 3$.\n**3.  Solution:**\nWe have found two possible solutions:  $a = -\\frac{1}{2}$ and $b = \\frac{9}{2}$, or $a = 1$ and $b = 0$.  However, we must check if these solutions work in both cases (for all values of $x$).  We see that the solution $a = 1$ and $b = 0$ does not work because it would make $f(x) = x$ for $x > 3$, which would not be an inverse function.  Therefore, the only solution is $a = -\\frac{1}{2}$ and $b = \\frac{9}{2}$.  \n**Answer:**  $a + b = -\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{9}{2} = \\boxed{4}$. \n",

Setting Up Equations**\nNow we have expressions for $f(f(x))$ in both cases.  We know that $f(f(x)) = x$ for all $x$.  This gives us two equations:\n* **For $x \\le 3$:**  $4x - 9 = x$\n* **For $x > \\frac{3 - b}{a}$:** $a^2x + ab + b = x$\n**4. Solving the Equations**\n* **From the first equation:**  $3x = 9 \\Rightarrow x = 3$. This equation is only satisfied when $x = 3$, which is on the boundary between the two cases. \n* **From the second equation:**  Since this equation must hold for all $x > \\frac{3 - b}{a}$, the coefficients must match:\n    * $a^2 = 1 \\Rightarrow a = 1$ or $a = -1$\n    * $ab + b = 0 \\Rightarrow b(a + 1) = 0$\n**5. Finding the Solution**\nSince $a = 1$ or $a = -1$, we have two possible solutions:\n* **If $a = 1$:** Then $b(1 + 1) = 0 \\Rightarrow b = 0$. \n* **If $a = -1$:** Then $b(-1 + 1) = 0$. This solution doesn't provide any information about $b$.\n**6. Checking the Solutions**\nWe need to check if these solutions actually satisfy the condition $f(f(x)) = x$ for all $x$.\n* **For $a = 1$, $b = 0$:** \n    *  The function becomes  $f(x) = \\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{cl}\n9 - 2x & \\text{if } x \\le 3, \\\\\nx & \\text{if } x > 3.\n\\end{array}\n\\right.$\n    * It's easy to verify that this function does indeed satisfy $f(f(x)) = x$ for all $x$. \n* **For $a = -1$ and any value of $b$:**  The function will not satisfy the condition for all $x$. For example, if we take $x = 4$, then $f(4) = -4 + b$, and since $-4 + b < 3$, we need to use the first part of the definition of $f$ again. This will lead to $f(f(4)) \\neq 4$.\n**7. Final Answer**\nTherefore, the only solution that works is $a = 1$ and $b = 0$.  Thus, $a + b = \\boxed{1}$. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\nThe problem gives us a piecewise function, *f(x)*, and tells us that applying the function twice (i.e., finding *f(f(x))*) returns the original input *x*. This means the function is its own inverse.\n**2. Finding the Inverse Function**\nSince *f(x)* is its own inverse, we can find its inverse by switching the roles of *x* and *y* and solving for *y*.  Let's do this for each piece of the function:\n* **Piece 1 (x \u2264 3):** \n   - Start with *y = 9 - 2x*\n   - Swap *x* and *y*: *x = 9 - 2y*\n   - Solve for *y*: *y = (9 - x) / 2*\n   - Since the original piece had *x \u2264 3*, the inverse must have *y \u2264 3*. This means *x \u2265 6* (because *x = 9 - 2y*).\n* **Piece 2 (x > 3):**\n   - Start with *y = ax + b*\n   - Swap *x* and *y*: *x = ay + b*\n   - Solve for *y*: *y = (x - b) / a*\n   - Since the original piece had *x > 3*, the inverse must have *y > 3*. This means *x > 3a + b* (because *x = ay + b*).\n**3. Matching the Pieces**\nNow we have two expressions for the inverse of *f(x)*. These expressions must be equal for all *x* values.  Let's consider what happens at the boundary *x = 6*:\n* **Piece 1:** At *x = 6*, the inverse is *(9 - 6) / 2 = 3/2*.\n* **Piece 2:** For the inverse from Piece 2 to equal *3/2* at *x = 6*, we must have *(6 - b) / a = 3/2*. \n**4. Solving for a and b**\nWe also know that the inverse of *f(x)* must have a value of *3* at *x = 3a + b* (from the restriction on *x* for the inverse of Piece 2).  Therefore:\n* **Piece 2:**  At *x = 3a + b*, the inverse is *(3a + b - b) / a = 3*.  This simplifies to *a = 1*.\nNow we can substitute *a = 1* into the equation we got earlier:\n* *(6 - b) / 1 = 3/2*\n* *6 - b = 3/2*\n* *b = 6 - 3/2 = 9/2*\n**5. Finding a + b**\nFinally, we have *a = 1* and *b = 9/2*.  Therefore:\n* *a + b = 1 + 9/2 = **11/2** *\n**Therefore, a + b = 11/2.** \n",
        "Here's a step-by-step solution to find the values of *a* and *b* and ultimately *a + b*:\n**1. Understand the Property:**\nThe property  *f(f(x)) = x* for all *x* means that *f* is its own inverse.  In other words, if you apply *f* to a value *x*, and then apply *f* again to the result, you get back the original value *x*.\n**2. Analyze the Cases:**\nSince *f* is defined piecewise, we need to consider cases based on the value of *x* and how it affects the application of *f* twice:\n* **Case 1: x \u2264 3** \n   *  *f(x) = 9 - 2x* (Since *x* \u2264 3, the first application of *f* uses the first part of the definition)\n   *  We need to determine if *f(x)* (which is *9 - 2x*) is less than or equal to 3 to know which part of the definition to use for the second application of *f*.  If *9 - 2x \u2264 3*, then *f(f(x)) = 9 - 2(9 - 2x) = 4x - 9*.  We want this to equal *x*, so we set up the equation: 4x - 9 = x. Solving, we find *x = 3*. This means that *f(f(3)) = 3*, which is consistent with the property.\n   * However, if *9 - 2x > 3*, then *f(f(x)) = a(9 - 2x) + b*. We want this to equal *x*. This leads to a more complex equation.\n* **Case 2: x > 3**\n   * *f(x) = ax + b* (Since *x* > 3, the first application of *f* uses the second part of the definition)\n   *  We need to determine if *ax + b* is less than or equal to 3 to know which part of the definition to use for the second application of *f*. \n      * If *ax + b \u2264 3*, then *f(f(x)) = 9 - 2(ax + b)*. We want this to equal *x*, so we set up the equation: 9 - 2(ax + b) = x.\n      * If *ax + b > 3*, then *f(f(x)) = a(ax + b) + b*. We want this to equal *x*, so we set up the equation: a(ax + b) + b = x.\n**3. Solve the Equations:**\nWe need to solve the equations we derived in the previous step.  It's easiest to focus on the equation that arises when *x > 3* and *ax + b \u2264 3*. This equation is:\n* 9 - 2(ax + b) = x \nSimplifying:\n* 9 - 2ax - 2b = x\n* 9 - 2b = x + 2ax\n* 9 - 2b = x(1 + 2a)\nSince this equation must hold for all *x > 3*, the coefficients of *x* on both sides must be equal.  Therefore:\n* 1 + 2a = 0  =>  a = -1/2 \nAlso, the constant terms must be equal:\n* 9 - 2b = 0  => b = 9/2\n**4. Calculate a + b:**\n* a + b = (-1/2) + (9/2) = 8/2 = **4**\n**Therefore, a + b = 4.** \n"
