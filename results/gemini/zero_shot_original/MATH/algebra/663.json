        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Absolute Value:**\n* The absolute value of a number is its distance from zero. So,  |x| is always non-negative (either zero or positive).\n**2. Analyze the Equation:**\n* The left side of the equation,  x\u00b2, is always non-negative (zero or positive) because it's a square.\n* The right side of the equation, -|x|, is always non-positive (zero or negative) because it's the negative of an absolute value.\n**3. Find the Solution:**\n* For the equation to hold true, both sides must be equal.  The only way a non-negative number can equal a non-positive number is if both sides are equal to zero.\n* Therefore, we have:\n    * x\u00b2 = 0\n    * -|x| = 0\n* Solving these equations, we find x = 0 as the only solution.\n**Answer:** There is **one** solution for *x* in the equation x\u00b2 = -|x|. \n",
        "Here's how we can solve the problem:\n**1. Understand the Absolute Value**\nThe absolute value of a number is its distance from zero. This means:\n*  If  *x* is positive,  | *x* | = *x*\n*  If  *x* is negative,  | *x* | = -*x*\n**2. Consider Cases**\nWe'll break the problem into two cases based on the sign of *x*:\n* **Case 1: *x* \u2265 0** \n   In this case, | *x* | = *x*.  The equation becomes:\n   *x*\u00b2 = -*x* \n   *x*\u00b2 + *x* = 0\n   *x*(*x* + 1) = 0\n   This gives us two possible solutions: *x* = 0 or *x* = -1. However, *x* = -1 is not a valid solution in this case because it contradicts our assumption that *x* \u2265 0.\n* **Case 2: *x* < 0**\n   In this case, | *x* | = -*x*. The equation becomes:\n   *x*\u00b2 = *x*\n   *x*\u00b2 - *x* = 0\n   *x*(*x* - 1) = 0\n   This gives us two possible solutions: *x* = 0 or *x* = 1. However, *x* = 1 is not a valid solution in this case because it contradicts our assumption that *x* < 0.\n**3. The Solution**\nThe only solution that satisfies both cases and the original equation is **x = 0**.\n**Therefore, there is only one solution for *x* in the equation *x*\u00b2 = -| *x* |.** \n",
