    "solution": "First we begin by solving the system of equations \\begin{align*}\n2a+4b&=5, \\\\\n3b&=a.\n\\end{align*}Making the substitution for $a$ from the second equation to the first, we get $2(3b)+4b=5$, which simplifies to $10b=5$. Solving for $b$, we find that $b=\\frac{1}{2}$. Plugging this into the second equation above, we obtain $a=3\\cdot \\frac{1}{2}$. Hence $3a=3\\cdot \\frac{3}{2}=\\boxed{\\frac{9}{2}}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n1. **Substitute:** Since we know  \"a is equal to three times b\", we can write  *a = 3b*.  Substitute this into the first equation: \n   2(3b) + 4b = 5\n2. **Simplify:**  \n   6b + 4b = 5\n   10b = 5\n3. **Solve for b:**\n   b = 5/10 \n   b = 1/2\n4. **Find a:** \n   Since a = 3b, we have a = 3 * (1/2) = 3/2\n5. **Calculate 3a:**\n   3a = 3 * (3/2) = 9/2\n**Therefore, 3a = 9/2** \n",
