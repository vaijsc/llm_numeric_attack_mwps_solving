Since $P(a,b,c)$ has degree 3 and is divisible by three linear terms, $P(a,b,c)$ must factor as $k(a-b)(b-c)(c-a)$ where $k$ is a constant. Hence, $P(a,b,c) = 0$ if and only if at least two of $a,b,c$ are equal.\n\nTo count how many triples $(a,b,c)$ satisfy this, we count the complement. There are $6\\cdot5\\cdot4 = 120$ triples where $a,b,c$ are all distinct, and $6\\cdot6\\cdot6=216$ triples total, so there are $216-120 = \\boxed{96}$ triples such that $P(a,b,c) = 0$.",

        "Here's a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n**1. Factor the expression:**\nThe given expression can be factored as follows:\n```\na^2b + b^2c + c^2a - ab^2 - bc^2 - ca^2  = (a - b)(b - c)(c - a) \n```\n**2. Analyze the factorization:**\nThe expression is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. This means we have three cases:\n* **Case 1:**  a - b = 0  (i.e., a = b)\n* **Case 2:** b - c = 0  (i.e., b = c)\n* **Case 3:** c - a = 0  (i.e., c = a)\n**3. Count the possibilities for each case:**\n* **Case 1 (a = b):** We have 6 choices for the value of 'a' (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and each choice determines the value of 'b'. Since 'c' can take on any of the 6 values, we have 6 * 6 = 36 possibilities.\n* **Case 2 (b = c):**  Similar to Case 1, we have 36 possibilities.\n* **Case 3 (c = a):**  Again, we have 36 possibilities.\n**4. Account for Overlapping Cases:**\nWe've overcounted the cases where *all* three factors are zero (i.e., a = b = c). There are 6 such cases (0, 0, 0), (1, 1, 1), ... , (5, 5, 5).\n**5. Calculate the Total:**\nThe total number of valid ordered triples is:\n(36 possibilities for Case 1) + (36 possibilities for Case 2) + (36 possibilities for Case 3) - (6 overlapping cases) = 102\n**Therefore, there are 102 ordered triples (a, b, c) that satisfy the given equation.** \n",

Analyze the Factors**\nFor the expression to equal zero, at least one of the factors must be zero.  This means:\n* **Case 1:**  a - b = 0  =>  a = b\n* **Case 2:**  a - c = 0  =>  a = c\n* **Case 3:**  b - c = 0  =>  b = c\n**3. Count the Possibilities**\n* **Case 1 (a = b):** We have 6 choices for the value of a (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5).  Since a = b, we also have 6 choices for the value of b. For each choice of (a, b), we have 6 choices for the value of c (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5). This gives us a total of 6 * 6 * 6 = 216 possibilities.\n* **Case 2 (a = c):** Similar to Case 1, we have 6 * 6 * 6 = 216 possibilities.\n* **Case 3 (b = c):** Again, we have 6 * 6 * 6 = 216 possibilities.\n**4. Avoid Overcounting**\nNotice that we've counted some triples multiple times. For example, the triple (2, 2, 2) is counted in all three cases.  We need to subtract the number of triples that were overcounted.\n* **Overcounted triples:** These are the triples where all three variables are equal. There are 6 such triples (0, 0, 0), (1, 1, 1), ..., (5, 5, 5).\n**5. Final Calculation**\nThe total number of ordered triples is:\n(Total possibilities from all cases) - (Overcounted triples) \n= (216 + 216 + 216) - 6 = **642**\nTherefore, there are **642** ordered triples (a, b, c) that satisfy the given equation. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step by step:\n**1. Factor the Expression**\nThe given expression can be factored as follows:\n```\na\u00b2b + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a - ab\u00b2 - bc\u00b2 - ca\u00b2 = (a - b)(a - c)(b - c) \n```\n**2. Analyze the Factorization**\nThe equation (a - b)(a - c)(b - c) = 0 means that at least one of the factors must be zero.  This gives us three possible cases:\n* **Case 1:**  a - b = 0  =>  a = b\n* **Case 2:**  a - c = 0  =>  a = c\n* **Case 3:**  b - c = 0  =>  b = c\n**3. Count the Possibilities**\nLet's count the number of solutions for each case:\n* **Case 1 (a = b):** Since 0 \u2264 a, b \u2264 5, we have 6 choices for the value of 'a' (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).  Each choice of 'a' determines the value of 'b'.  We have 5 choices for 'c' (since it can be any of the 6 values except for 'a').  This gives us 6 * 5 = 30 solutions.\n* **Case 2 (a = c):**  This is similar to Case 1. We have 30 solutions here as well.\n* **Case 3 (b = c):** This also gives us 30 solutions.\n**4. Avoiding Overcounting**\nNotice that we've counted some solutions multiple times. For example, the triple (2, 2, 2) is counted in all three cases.  We need to subtract the number of triples that are counted more than once.\n* **Overlapping Solutions:**  There are 6 triples where all three variables are equal (0, 0, 0), (1, 1, 1), ..., (5, 5, 5). \n* **Total Solutions:**  The total number of solutions is 30 + 30 + 30 - 6 = 84.\n**Answer:** There are **84** ordered triples (a, b, c) that satisfy the given equation. \n",

Analyze the Factors**\nWe want to find the number of ordered triples (a, b, c) that make this expression equal to zero.  For the product of three factors to be zero, at least one of the factors must be zero.  This means we have three cases:\n* **Case 1:** (a - b) = 0  \n   This implies a = b. Since 0 \u2264 a, b \u2264 5, there are 6 possibilities for the pair (a, b): (0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5).  For each of these, 'c' can take any value from 0 to 5, giving us 6 choices.  Therefore, this case yields 6 * 6 = 36 solutions.\n* **Case 2:** (b - c) = 0\n   This implies b = c.  Similar to case 1, there are 6 possibilities for the pair (b, c), and for each, 'a' can take 6 values. So, this case also yields 6 * 6 = 36 solutions.\n* **Case 3:** (c - a) = 0\n   This implies c = a.  This case is identical to the previous two, yielding 36 solutions.\n**3. Avoid Overcounting**\nNotice that we've counted some solutions multiple times. For example, the triple (1, 1, 1) is counted in all three cases. We need to subtract the number of triples counted twice.\n* There are 6 triples where all three numbers are equal: (0, 0, 0), (1, 1, 1), ..., (5, 5, 5).  We've counted each of these 3 times.\n**4. Calculate the Final Count**\nThe total number of solutions is:\n(Number of solutions in each case) - (Number of overcounted solutions) + (Number of solutions counted 3 times)\n= (36 + 36 + 36) - (3 * 6) + 6 \n= 108 - 18 + 6\n= **96**\nTherefore, there are **96** ordered triples (a, b, c) that satisfy the given equation. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Factor the Expression**\nThe given expression looks like it might factor nicely.  Let's try:\n* **Rearrange terms:**  \n  \n  ```\n  a^2b + b^2c + c^2a - ab^2 - bc^2 - ca^2 = \n  (a^2b - ab^2) + (b^2c - bc^2) + (c^2a - ca^2) \n  ```\n* **Factor out common factors:**\n  ```\n  = ab(a-b) + bc(b-c) + ca(c-a)\n  ```\n* **Notice a pattern:**  We can rearrange this to make the pattern more clear:\n  ```\n  = ab(a-b) + bc(b-c) + ca(c-a) = \n  -ab(b-a) - bc(c-b) - ca(a-c) \n  ```\n* **Factor out a negative:**\n  ```\n  = -(ab(b-a) + bc(c-b) + ca(a-c))\n  ```\n**2.  Recognize the Cyclic Nature**\nThe expression inside the parentheses has a cyclic pattern:  each term involves the product of two variables and the difference of those two variables. \n**3.  Zero Product Property**\nFor the entire expression to equal zero, the expression inside the parentheses must equal zero.  Since the terms are added, one or more of the following must be true:\n*  `ab(b-a) = 0`\n*  `bc(c-b) = 0`\n*  `ca(a-c) = 0`\n**4.  Solve for Possible Cases**\nLet's examine each of these cases:\n* **Case 1: `ab(b-a) = 0`** \n   * This means either `a = 0`, `b = 0`, or `a = b`. \n* **Case 2: `bc(c-b) = 0`**\n   * This means either `b = 0`, `c = 0`, or `b = c`.\n* **Case 3: `ca(a-c) = 0`**\n   * This means either `c = 0`, `a = 0`, or `a = c`.\n**5.  Count the Solutions**\nWe need to be careful not to overcount solutions.  Let's systematically count the possible triples:\n* **(a, b, c) = (0, 0, 0):** This is one solution.\n* **(a, b, c) where two of the variables are 0:**  We have 3 choices for which two variables are zero (e.g., (0, 0, 1), (0, 1, 0), (1, 0, 0)).  For each of these choices, the third variable can be any of the 5 values (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5). This gives us 3 * 5 = 15 solutions.\n* **(a, b, c) where all three variables are equal:** We have 5 choices for the common value (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5). This gives us 5 solutions.\n* **(a, b, c) where two variables are equal, but not 0:**  We have 5 choices for the common value (1, 2, 3, 4, or 5). Then the third variable can be any of the remaining 4 values. This gives us 5 * 4 = 20 solutions.\n**6. Total Count**\nAdding up all the cases, we have a total of 1 + 15 + 5 + 20 = **41** solutions. \n"
