        "1. **Divide by -1:** To make the leading coefficient positive, we divide both sides of the equation by -1: \n   \n   $0 = -9x^2 - 3x + 2$ becomes $0 = 9x^2 + 3x - 2$\n2. **Factor:** We need to find two numbers that multiply to give 9 * -2 = -18 and add up to 3.  These numbers are 6 and -3:\n   $0 = (9x - 3)(x + 2)$\n3. **Solve for x:** Now we set each factor equal to zero and solve:\n   *  $9x - 3 = 0$  -->  $9x = 3$  -->  $x = \\frac{1}{3}$\n   *  $x + 2 = 0$  -->  $x = -2$\n4. **Choose the positive solution:** Since we are given that $x > 0$, the only valid solution is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$. \n",
        "1. **Divide by -1:**  To make the leading coefficient positive, divide both sides of the equation by -1:\n   \n   ```\n   0 = -9x^2 - 3x + 2 \n   0 = 9x^2 + 3x - 2\n   ```\n2. **Factor:** The quadratic equation is now in standard form. We can factor it as:\n   ```\n   0 = (3x - 1)(3x + 2)\n   ```\n3. **Solve for x:**  For the product of two factors to be zero, at least one of the factors must be zero.  Therefore:\n   *  $3x - 1 = 0$  implies  $x = \\frac{1}{3}$\n   *  $3x + 2 = 0$ implies $x = -\\frac{2}{3}$\n4. **Choose the positive solution:**  Since the problem states that $x > 0$, the solution is  $x = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$. \n",
        "1. **Divide by -1:**  To make the coefficient of the $x^2$ term positive, we can divide both sides of the equation by -1: \n   \n   $$0 = -9x^2 - 3x + 2 \\implies 0 = 9x^2 + 3x - 2$$\n2. **Factor the quadratic:**  The quadratic expression on the right side of the equation factors as:\n   $$0 = (3x - 1)(3x + 2)$$\n3. **Solve for x:**  For the product of two factors to be zero, at least one of the factors must be zero.  This gives us two possible solutions:\n   *  $3x - 1 = 0 \\implies x = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$\n   *  $3x + 2 = 0 \\implies x = -\\frac{2}{3}$\nSince we are only looking for solutions where $x > 0$, the only valid solution is $x = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$. \n",
