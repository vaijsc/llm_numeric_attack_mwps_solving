        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Set up an equation:**\nSince we know the sum of the two numbers, we can write an equation:\nAMC10 + AMC12 = 123422\n**2. Align the digits:**\nTo make it easier to add, let's write the numbers vertically:\n```\n  AMC10\n+ AMC12\n-------\n 123422\n```\n**3. Add the units digits:**\nThe units digit of the sum (2) is the result of adding the units digits of the two numbers (0 + 2).\n**4. Add the tens digits:**\nThe tens digit of the sum (2) is the result of adding the tens digits of the two numbers (1 + 1).\n**5.  Carry over the hundreds digit:**\nNotice that the hundreds digit of the sum (4) is less than the sum of the hundreds digits of the two numbers (C + C).  This means there must have been a carry-over from the tens place.  \n**6. Solve for C:**\nSince the carry-over was 1 (from the tens place), we can set up the following equation:\n2C + 1 = 4  \nSolving for C, we get:\nC = 3/2\nSince C must be a digit, it's impossible for it to be a fraction. This means there must be a carry-over from the thousands place.\n**7. Solve for M:**\nNow, let's consider the thousands digit of the sum (3). Since there was a carry-over of 1 from the hundreds place, we have:\n2M + 1 = 3\nSolving for M, we get:\nM = 1\n**8. Solve for A:**\nFinally, consider the ten-thousands digit of the sum (2). Again, there must be a carry-over of 1 from the thousands place.  This gives us:\n2A + 1 = 2\nSolving for A, we get:\nA = 1/2\nAgain, A must be a digit, so this is impossible. This means there must be a carry-over from the hundred-thousands place.\n**9. Find the final solution:**\nSince there's a carry-over from the hundred-thousands place, the sum of the hundred-thousands digits must be 1 (since the hundred-thousands digit of the sum is 1).  This gives us:\nA + A = 1\nA = 1/2\nAgain, this is impossible.\n**Conclusion:**\nThere is no solution to this problem.  It's likely there's a typo in the given sum (123422). \n",
        "Here's how we can solve the problem step-by-step:\n1. **Align the numbers:**  Write the numbers vertically to help us add them:\n   ```\n   AMC10\n   AMC12\n   -------\n   123422\n   ```\n2. **Focus on the units digit:** The units digit of the sum is 2, and the units digits of the numbers being added are 0 and 2. This means the units digit of the sum of the \"C\" values must be 0 (since 0 + 2 = 2).\n3. **Carry over:** Since the tens digit of the sum is 2, and the tens digits of the numbers being added are 1 and 1, we know there was a carry-over of 1 from the units column.\n4. **Add the \"M\" digits:** We need a carry-over of 1 from the tens digit to make the hundreds digit of the sum 4. Since the tens digits of the numbers being added are both 1, the \"M\" digits must add up to 1 + 1 + 1 (carry-over) = 3.  Therefore, the sum of the \"M\" values is 3.\n5. **Add the \"A\" digits:** The thousands digit of the sum is 3, and the thousands digits of the numbers being added are both \"A\".  Since we need a carry-over of 1 from the hundreds column, the \"A\" digits must add up to 2 (3 - 1 = 2). Therefore, the sum of the \"A\" values is 2.\n6. **Calculate A + M + C:** We know A + M + C = 2 + 3 + 0 = **5**.\n**Therefore, A + M + C = 5.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Align the numbers:**\n   Write the two numbers vertically, aligning the digits:\n   ```\n   AMC10\n   AMC12\n   -----\n   123422\n   ```\n**2. Analyze the ones place:**\n   * The ones place adds up to 2 (0 + 2 = 2).\n**3. Analyze the tens place:**\n   * The tens place adds up to 2 (1 + 1 = 2).\n**4. Analyze the hundreds place:**\n   * The hundreds place adds up to 4 (C + C = 4).  Since C is a single digit, we know C = 2.\n**5. Analyze the thousands place:**\n   * The thousands place adds up to 3 (M + M = 3). Since M is a single digit, we know M = 1.\n**6. Analyze the ten-thousands place:**\n   * The ten-thousands place adds up to 2 (A + A = 2). Since A is a single digit, we know A = 1.\n**7. Calculate A + M + C:**\n   * A + M + C = 1 + 1 + 2 = **4** \n",

Analyze the units digit:**\n   * The units digit of the sum is 2. This means the units digit of `AMC10` plus the units digit of `AMC12` must have a units digit of 2.  \n   * The only way this can work is if the units digit of `AMC10` is 0 and the units digit of `AMC12` is 2.\n**3. Analyze the tens digit:**\n   *  The tens digit of the sum is 2. This means the tens digit of `AMC10` plus the tens digit of `AMC12` must have a tens digit of 2. \n   *  Since the units digit of `AMC12` is 2, the tens digit of `AMC10` must be 0.\n**4. Analyze the hundreds digit:**\n   * The hundreds digit of the sum is 4.  \n   *  Since the tens digit of `AMC10` is 0, the hundreds digit of `AMC12` must be 4.\n**5. Analyze the thousands digit:**\n   * The thousands digit of the sum is 3. \n   * Since the hundreds digit of `AMC10` is 0, the thousands digit of `AMC12` must be 3.\n**6. Analyze the ten thousands digit:**\n   * The ten thousands digit of the sum is 2. \n   * Since the thousands digit of `AMC10` is 1, the ten thousands digit of `AMC12` must be 1. \n**7.  The solution:**\n   Now we know the numbers are:\n   ```\n   10010\n   13412\n   -------\n   123422 \n   ```\n   Therefore,  A + M + C = 1 + 0 + 3 = **4**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Align the numbers:**\n```\n  AMC10\n+ AMC12\n-------\n 123422\n```\n**2. Focus on the units digit:**\n* The units digit of the sum is 2, which is the same as the units digit of both numbers.  This tells us that C + 2 must end in 2.  \n* The only way this is possible is if C = 0.\n**3.  Look at the tens digit:**\n* The tens digit of the sum is 2.  Since C = 0, we have 1 + 1 = 2. \n**4.  Consider the hundreds digit:**\n* The hundreds digit of the sum is 4.  We know C = 0, so  M + M must end in 4.\n* This means M must be either 2 or 7.\n**5.  Examine the thousands digit:**\n* The thousands digit of the sum is 3. Since C = 0, we have A + A + (possible carry-over from the hundreds digit) must end in 3.\n*  If M = 2, then A + A + 1 (carry-over) must end in 3. This means A = 1.\n* If M = 7, then A + A + 1 (carry-over) must end in 3. This means A = 6.\n**6.  Check for consistency:**\n* Let's try both possibilities and see if they work:\n    * If A = 1 and M = 2, the sum becomes 12010 + 12012 = 123422.  This works!\n    * If A = 6 and M = 7, the sum becomes 67010 + 67012 = 134022.  This does not work.\n**7.  Find the answer:**\nSince A = 1, M = 2, and C = 0,  A + M + C = 1 + 2 + 0 = **3**. \n"
