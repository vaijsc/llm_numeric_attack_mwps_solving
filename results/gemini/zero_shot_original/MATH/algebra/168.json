    "solution": "Evelyn covered more distance in less time than Briana, Debra and Angela, so her average speed is greater than any of their average speeds. Evelyn went almost as far as Carla in less than half the time that it took Carla, so Evelyn's average speed is also greater than Carla's. Therefore, $\\boxed{\\text{Evelyn}}$ is our answer.",

        "Here's how to determine who has the greatest average speed:\n* **Understanding Speed:** Speed is calculated by dividing distance by time (speed = distance / time).\n* **Visualizing on the Graph:**  On the graph, distance is represented on the vertical axis (y-axis) and time is represented on the horizontal axis (x-axis).\n* **Finding the Steepest Line:**  The steeper the line on the graph, the faster the runner is moving. This is because they are covering more distance in a shorter amount of time.\n* **Comparing Slopes:**  Visually compare the slopes of the lines for each runner. The line with the steepest slope represents the runner with the highest average speed.\n**Looking at the graph, we see that Evelyn's line has the steepest slope.  Therefore, Evelyn has the greatest average speed.** \n",
        "Here's how to determine which student has the greatest average speed:\n* **Understanding Speed:** Speed is calculated by dividing distance by time (speed = distance / time).\n* **Interpreting the Graph:**  The graph shows distance on the vertical axis and time on the horizontal axis.  Each dot represents a runner's position at a certain time.\n* **Visualizing Speed:**  A steeper line on the graph indicates a faster speed because the runner is covering more distance in a shorter amount of time.\n**Let's analyze each runner:**\n* **Evelyn:**  Evelyn's line is very steep, indicating a high speed.\n* **Briana:** Briana's line is less steep than Evelyn's, meaning she's slower.\n* **Carla:** Carla's line is steeper than Briana's but less steep than Evelyn's.\n* **Debra:** Debra's line is less steep than Carla's, indicating a slower speed.\n* **Angela:** Angela's line is the least steep, meaning she has the slowest speed.\n**Conclusion:**  **Evelyn has the greatest average speed** because her line on the graph is the steepest, indicating she covers the most distance in the shortest amount of time. \n",
        "Here's how to determine who has the greatest average speed:\n**Understanding Average Speed**\nAverage speed is calculated as:\n* **Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time**\n**Analyzing the Graph**\n* **Distance:**  The vertical axis represents the distance covered.\n* **Time:** The horizontal axis represents the time taken.\n**Finding the Fastest Runner**\nTo find the runner with the greatest average speed, we need to find the runner who covered the most distance in the least amount of time.  Look for the runner whose line on the graph has the steepest slope.  \n**The Answer**\n* **Carla** has the steepest line on the graph. This means she covered the most distance in the least amount of time, giving her the greatest average speed. \n",

This indicates a higher speed.\n* **Briana:**  She travels a shorter distance compared to Evelyn and Debra but takes a longer time. This suggests a lower speed.\n* **Carla:** She travels a greater distance than Debra and Angela, but takes a longer time than Evelyn. It's possible she has a lower speed than Evelyn.\n* **Debra:**  She travels a shorter distance than Carla and Evelyn but takes a longer time than Carla and Evelyn. This indicates a low speed.\n* **Angela:**  She travels the shortest distance of all the students in the longest time. This suggests the lowest speed.\n**Conclusion**\nBased on this analysis, **Evelyn** likely has the greatest average speed because she covers the most distance in the least amount of time. \n"
