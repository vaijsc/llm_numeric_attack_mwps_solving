        "Here's how we can solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the inequality:**\n*  The inequality $x^{-1} > x$ means  1/x is greater than x. \n**2. Consider the relationship between x and 1/x:**\n* As x increases, 1/x decreases.\n* This means there's a point where x and 1/x are equal.\n**3. Find the point of equality:**\n* Set x equal to 1/x and solve: \n   * x = 1/x\n   * x\u00b2 = 1\n   * x = 1 or x = -1\n**4. Analyze the inequality for positive values of x:**\n*  For x > 1, 1/x < x. This does not satisfy the inequality.\n* For 0 < x < 1, 1/x > x. This satisfies the inequality.\n**5. Determine the number of positive integer solutions:**\n*  There is only **one** positive integer value of x that satisfies the inequality: **x = 1**. \n**Therefore, there is only one positive integer value of x for which x\u207b\u00b9 > x.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Understand the inequality:**\n*  The inequality  $x^{-1} > x$ means  $\\frac{1}{x} > x$.\n**2. Analyze the inequality:**\n* If $x$ is greater than 1, then $\\frac{1}{x}$ will be less than 1, and therefore less than $x$.  So, the inequality is not satisfied when $x > 1$.\n* If $x$ is equal to 1, then both $\\frac{1}{x}$ and $x$ are equal to 1, so the inequality is not satisfied.\n* If $x$ is between 0 and 1, then $\\frac{1}{x}$ will be greater than 1, and therefore greater than $x$. So, the inequality is satisfied when $0 < x < 1$.\n* If $x$ is less than or equal to 0, then $\\frac{1}{x}$ is either undefined or negative, so the inequality is not satisfied.\n**3. Determine the solutions:**\n* The only positive integers that satisfy $0 < x < 1$ are none.\n**Therefore, there are $\\boxed{0}$ positive integer values of $x$ for which $x^{-1} > x$.** \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understanding the inequality:**\n*  The inequality  $x^{-1} > x$  means  $\\frac{1}{x} > x$.\n**2. Simplifying the inequality:**\n*  To get rid of the fraction, multiply both sides by  *x*: \n   *  If  $x$ is positive, we don't need to flip the inequality sign.\n   *  We get:  $1 > x^2$\n**3. Solving for *x*:**\n*  Subtract 1 from both sides:  $0 > x^2 - 1$\n*  Factor the right side:  $0 > (x + 1)(x - 1)$\n**4. Finding the solution:**\n* For the product of two numbers to be negative, one number must be positive and the other must be negative.\n* This means either:\n    *  $x + 1 > 0$ and $x - 1 < 0$ \n    *  $x + 1 < 0$ and $x - 1 > 0$\n*  Solving these inequalities, we get:\n    *  $-1 < x < 1$ \n**5. Considering positive integers:**\n* The only positive integer that satisfies  $-1 < x < 1$ is  **x = 1**.\n**Answer:** There is only **one** positive integer value of *x* that satisfies the inequality. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the inequality:**\n*  The inequality  $x^{-1} > x$ means  \"the reciprocal of *x* is greater than *x*.\" \n**2. Consider the behavior of reciprocals:**\n* When *x* is greater than 1, its reciprocal (1/x) is smaller than *x*.\n* When *x* is between 0 and 1, its reciprocal (1/x) is larger than *x*.\n* When *x* is equal to 1, its reciprocal is also 1.\n**3. Find the solution:**\n* Based on our understanding of reciprocals, the inequality $x^{-1} > x$ is only true when *x* is between 0 and 1. \n**4. Positive Integer Solutions:**\n* There are **no** positive integer values of *x* that fall between 0 and 1.  \n**Answer:**  There are **zero** positive integer values of *x* for which $x^{-1} > x$. \n",

Analyze the inequality:**\n* For $\\frac{1}{x}$ to be greater than $x$,  $x$ must be a fraction between 0 and 1.  This is because:\n    * If $x$ is greater than 1, then $\\frac{1}{x}$ will be less than 1 and therefore less than $x$.\n    * If $x$ is equal to 1, then $\\frac{1}{x}$ will also be equal to 1, and they won't be greater than each other.\n    * If $x$ is less than 1 (but still positive), then $\\frac{1}{x}$ will be greater than 1, and therefore greater than $x$.\n**3. Find the solutions:**\n* Since we're looking for *positive integer* values of $x$, there are **no** solutions.  Integers between 0 and 1 are not positive integers.\n**Therefore, there are **zero** positive integer values of $x$ that satisfy the inequality $x^{-1} > x$.** \n"
