        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Solve for x\u00b2**\n* Divide both sides of the equation by 16: \n   12x\u00b2 - 1 = 0\n* Add 1 to both sides:\n   12x\u00b2 = 1\n* Divide both sides by 12:\n   x\u00b2 = 1/12\n**2. Find x\u2074**\n* Square both sides of the equation x\u00b2 = 1/12:\n   (x\u00b2)\u00b2 = (1/12)\u00b2\n   x\u2074 = 1/144\n**3. Find 1/x\u2074**\n* Take the reciprocal of both sides:\n   1/x\u2074 = 144\n**Therefore, the value of 1/x\u2074 is 144.** \n",
