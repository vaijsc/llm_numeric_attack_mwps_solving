        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Rewrite the Circle's Equation**\nStart by completing the square to rewrite the equation of the circle in standard form:\n*  $x^2 - 4x + y^2 - 8y = 0$ \n*  $(x^2 - 4x + 4) + (y^2 - 8y + 16) = 4 + 16$\n*  $(x-2)^2 + (y-4)^2 = 20$\nNow we see that the circle has center $(2, 4)$ and radius $\\sqrt{20}$.\n**2. Find the Line Connecting the Center and the Point**\nThe shortest distance from a point to a circle is along the line segment connecting the point to the center of the circle.  Let's find the equation of this line.  The slope is:\n*  $\\frac{-2 - 4}{5 - 2} = -2$\nUsing the point-slope form, the equation of the line is:\n*  $y + 2 = -2(x - 5)$\n*  $y = -2x + 8$\n**3. Find the Intersection Point**\nWe need to find where this line intersects the circle. Substitute the equation of the line into the equation of the circle:\n*  $(x-2)^2 + (-2x + 8 - 4)^2 = 20$\n*  $(x-2)^2 + (-2x + 4)^2 = 20$\n*  $x^2 - 4x + 4 + 4x^2 - 16x + 16 = 20$\n*  $5x^2 - 20x = 0$\n*  $5x(x - 4) = 0$\nThis gives us solutions $x = 0$ and $x = 4$.  Substituting back into the equation of the line, we find the corresponding y-values:\n*  If $x = 0$, then $y = 8$\n*  If $x = 4$, then $y = 0$\nSo the line intersects the circle at the points $(0,8)$ and $(4,0)$.  Since $(4,0)$ is closer to $(5,-2)$, this is the point we want.\n**4. Calculate the Distance**\nFinally, use the distance formula to find the distance between $(4,0)$ and $(5,-2)$:\n*  $\\sqrt{(5-4)^2 + (-2-0)^2} = \\sqrt{5}$\n**Answer:** The shortest distance is $\\sqrt{5}$, so $m = \\boxed{5}$. \n",

We see that the circle has a center of (2, 4) and a radius of $\\sqrt{20}$.\n**2. Find the Distance from the Center to the Point**\nUse the distance formula to find the distance between the center of the circle (2, 4) and the point (5, -2):\n* Distance = $\\sqrt{(5 - 2)^2 + (-2 - 4)^2}$ \n* Distance = $\\sqrt{3^2 + (-6)^2}$\n* Distance = $\\sqrt{45}$\n**3. Consider the Relationship Between Distances**\nThe shortest distance from the circle to the point (5, -2) will occur along the line segment that passes through the center of the circle and the point (5, -2).  \n* This shortest distance will be the distance from the center to the point (5, -2) *minus* the radius of the circle. \n**4. Calculate the Shortest Distance**\n* Shortest distance = $\\sqrt{45} - \\sqrt{20}$\n* Shortest distance = $\\sqrt{9 \\cdot 5} - \\sqrt{4 \\cdot 5}$\n* Shortest distance = $3\\sqrt{5} - 2\\sqrt{5}$\n* Shortest distance = $\\sqrt{5}$\n**Answer:**\nTherefore, the shortest distance from the circle to the point (5, -2) can be written in the form $\\sqrt{m}$, where  *m* = **5**. \n",
