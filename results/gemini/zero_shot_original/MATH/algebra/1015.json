    "problem": "Find the smallest integer value of $n$ such that $n^2-5n-14$ is negative.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Writing this as an inequality, we get the expression \\begin{align*} n^2-5n-14&<0 \\quad \\Rightarrow\n\\\\ (n-7)(n+2)&<0.\n\\end{align*} Since -2 and 7 are roots of the quadratic, the inequality must change sign at these two points. Thus, we continue by testing the 3 intervals of $n$. For $n<-2$, both factors of the inequality are negative, thus making it positive. For $-2<n<7$, only $n-7$ is negative, so the inequality is negative. Finally, for $n>7$, both factors are positive, making the inequality positive once again. This tells us that the range of $n$ that satisfy the inequality is $-2<n<7$. Since the question asks for the smallest integer value of $n$, the answer is the smallest integer greater than $-2$, which is $\\boxed{-1}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Factor the quadratic expression:**\nThe expression  n\u00b2 - 5n - 14 factors as (n - 7)(n + 2).\n**2. Find the roots of the quadratic:**\nThe roots are the values of n that make the expression equal to zero:\n* n - 7 = 0  =>  n = 7\n* n + 2 = 0  =>  n = -2\n**3. Determine the intervals where the expression is negative:**\nSince the leading coefficient of the quadratic is positive (1), the parabola opens upwards.  This means:\n* The expression is negative between the roots.\n**4. Identify the smallest integer:**\nThe smallest integer between -2 and 7 is **-1**.\n**Therefore, the smallest integer value of n such that n\u00b2 - 5n - 14 is negative is n = -1.** \n",

Factor the quadratic:**\nThe quadratic  *n\u00b2 - 5n - 14* factors into *(n - 7)(n + 2)*.\n**2. Find the zeros:**\nThe expression equals zero when either factor is zero:\n*  n - 7 = 0  =>  n = 7\n*  n + 2 = 0  =>  n = -2\n**3.
