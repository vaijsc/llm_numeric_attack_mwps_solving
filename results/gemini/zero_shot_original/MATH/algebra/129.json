        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Set up the expressions for the areas:**\n* **Square A (enlarged):**  The side length is now  2009 + *x*, so the area is (2009 + *x*)\u00b2 \n* **Square B (reduced):** The side length is now 2009 - *x*, so the area is (2009 - *x*)\u00b2\n* **Original Square:**  The area is 2009 * 2009\n**2.  Formulate the inequality:**\nWe want the difference in area between the enlarged and reduced squares to be at least as great as the area of the original square.

Solve for x:**\nDivide both sides by 4: \n* *x* \u2265 2009 / 4 \n**5.
