    "solution": "Looking at the graph, the line has a $y$-intercept of 3.  Also, counting carefully, we can see that when the line travels exactly 7 units horizontally, it travels 4 units vertically.  Therefore, the slope of the line is $4/7$.  So, the equation of the line in slope-intercept form is $y=\\frac{4}{7}x+3$.  Substituting 1001 for $x$ and $n$ for $y$, we can find $n$: \\begin{align*}\nn&=\\frac{4}{7}\\cdot 1001 +3\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=4\\cdot 143 +3\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=572+3=\\boxed{575}.\n\\end{align*}",

        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Determine the slope:**\n*  The line passes through the origin (0,0) and the point (10, 8.71).\n*  The slope is calculated as (change in y) / (change in x) = (8.71 - 0) / (10 - 0) = 0.871\n**2. Use the slope-intercept form:**\n* The slope-intercept form of a linear equation is y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.\n* We know the slope (m = 0.871) and the y-intercept (b = 0).\n* So the equation of the line is y = 0.871x + 0.\n**3. Find the y-coordinate for x = 1001:**\n*  Substitute x = 1001 into the equation:\n    * y = 0.871 * 1001 + 0 \n    * y = 872.871\n**Therefore, n = 872.871** \n",

        "Here's how we can find the value of 'n':\n1. **Find the slope:**  Notice that the line passes through the origin (0, 0).
