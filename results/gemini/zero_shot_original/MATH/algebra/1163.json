    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since $P(x)$ is defined only for $x\\ge -2$, we must have $G(a) \\ge -2$ in order for $P(G(a))$ to be defined.  Therefore, we must have $4-3a \\ge -2$, so $6\\ge 3a$, which means $2\\ge a$.  Checking, we see that $P(G(2)) = P(-2) = 4$, so $a=\\boxed{2}$ is the largest constant $a$ such that $P(G(a))$ is defined.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Problem:**\n* We're given two functions,  *P(x)* and *G(x)*.\n* We need to find the largest value of 'a' for which the composite function *P(G(a))* is defined. \n**2.  Composite Function:**\n* The composite function *P(G(a))* means we first evaluate *G(a)* and then use that result as the input for *P(x)*.\n**3.  Restrictions on the Input:**\n*  **P(x) = 4 + 2\u221a(x + 2):** This function has a square root.  We can only take the square root of non-negative numbers. So, *x + 2 \u2265 0*, which means *x \u2265 -2*.\n* **G(x) = 4 - 3x:**  This function is a linear function and has no restrictions on its input.\n**4.  Combining the Restrictions:**\n* Since we're evaluating *P(G(a))*, we need to ensure that the output of *G(a)* is greater than or equal to -2  to satisfy the restriction on *P(x)*. \n*  In other words,  *G(a) \u2265 -2* \n**5.  Solving for 'a':**\n* Substitute *G(x) = 4 - 3x* into the inequality:\n   * 4 - 3a \u2265 -2\n* Solve for 'a':\n   * -3a \u2265 -6\n   * a \u2264 2\n**6.  Largest Value of 'a':**\n* We found that *a \u2264 2* to ensure *P(G(a))* is defined.  The largest value of 'a' that satisfies this condition is **a = 2**.\n**Therefore, the largest constant 'a' such that P(G(a)) is defined is a = 2.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\nWe're given two functions,  *P(x)* and *G(x)*. We need to find the largest value of *a* for which the expression *P(G(a))* is defined. This means we need to find the largest *a* that doesn't cause any issues within the functions.\n**2. Analyzing the Functions**\n* **P(x) = 4 + 2\u221a(x + 2):**  This function has a square root. For the square root to be defined, the expression inside it (x + 2) must be greater than or equal to zero. \n* **G(x) = 4 - 3x:** This function is a linear function, and it's defined for all real numbers.\n**3. Finding the Restriction on 'a'**\n* **Focus on P(x):**  We need to make sure the argument inside the square root in *P(x)* is non-negative.  Since we're evaluating *P(G(a))*,  we need *G(a)* + 2 \u2265 0.\n**4. Solving the Inequality**\n* Substitute *G(a) = 4 - 3a* into the inequality: \n   (4 - 3a) + 2 \u2265 0\n* Simplify: \n   6 - 3a \u2265 0\n* Solve for *a*:\n   -3a \u2265 -6\n    a \u2264 2\n**5. Conclusion**\nThe largest value of *a* that satisfies the condition is *a = 2*. Therefore, the largest constant *a* such that *P(G(a))* is defined is **a = 2**. \n",
