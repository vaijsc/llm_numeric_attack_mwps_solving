    "problem": "Jeremiah is riding in a car that is traveling 60 miles per hour. At this rate, how many minutes will it take him to travel 20 miles?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Distance equals rate times time, so the trip will take $$\\frac{20\\text{ mi.}}{60\\text{ mph}}=\\frac{1}{3}\\text{ hours}.$$  One-third of an hour is $\\boxed{20}$ minutes.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Relationship:**\n* **Speed:** How fast the car is moving (60 miles per hour).\n* **Distance:** How far the car will travel (20 miles).\n* **Time:** How long it will take to travel that distance.\n**2. Use the Formula:**\n* **Time = Distance / Speed**\n**3. Plug in the Values:**\n* Time = 20 miles / 60 miles per hour\n**4. Simplify:**\n* Time = 1/3 hour\n**5. Convert to Minutes:**\n* Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, multiply (1/3) hour by 60 minutes/hour.\n* Time = (1/3) hour * 60 minutes/hour = 20 minutes\n**Answer:** It will take Jeremiah **20 minutes** to travel 20 miles. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Convert miles per hour to miles per minute:**\n* There are 60 minutes in an hour, so divide the speed by 60: 60 miles/hour \u00f7 60 minutes/hour = 1 mile/minute\n**2. Calculate the time to travel 20 miles:**\n* Since the car travels 1 mile per minute, it will take 20 minutes to travel 20 miles.\n**Answer:** It will take Jeremiah **20 minutes** to travel 20 miles. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Convert hours to minutes:**\n* There are 60 minutes in one hour.\n**2. Calculate the time to travel one mile:**\n* If the car travels 60 miles in 60 minutes, it travels 1 mile in 1 minute.\n**3. Calculate the time to travel 20 miles:**\n* Since the car travels 1 mile per minute, it will take 20 minutes to travel 20 miles.\n**Answer:** It will take Jeremiah **20 minutes** to travel 20 miles. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the relationship between distance, speed, and time:**\n* **Distance:** How far something travels (in miles in this case).\n* **Speed:** How fast something is moving (in miles per hour).\n* **Time:** How long it takes to travel a certain distance. \n**2. Use the formula:**\n* **Time = Distance / Speed**\n**3. Plug in the values:**\n* **Time = 20 miles / 60 miles per hour**\n**4. Calculate the time:**\n* **Time = 0.33 hours**\n**5. Convert hours to minutes:**\n* **Time = 0.33 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 20 minutes**\n**Answer:** It will take Jeremiah **20 minutes** to travel 20 miles. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Relationship:**\n* **Speed:** 60 miles per hour (mph) means the car travels 60 miles in 60 minutes (1 hour).\n**2. Calculate Time for 1 Mile:**\n* If the car travels 60 miles in 60 minutes, it travels 1 mile in 1 minute (60 miles / 60 minutes = 1 mile/minute).\n**3. Calculate Time for 20 Miles:**\n* Since the car travels 1 mile per minute, it will take 20 minutes to travel 20 miles (20 miles * 1 minute/mile = 20 minutes).\n**Answer:** It will take Jeremiah **20 minutes** to travel 20 miles. \n"
