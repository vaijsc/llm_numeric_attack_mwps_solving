    "solution": "First, note that $f(x)$ and $f(6x)$ have the same range, because every value assumed by $f(x)$ (at, say, $x=a$) is also assumed by $f(6x)$ (at $x=\\frac a6$), and vice versa.\n\nSince $g(x)=f(6x)+1$, its range is equal to the range of $f(6x)$ with all values increased by $1$. Thus, the range of $g(x)$ is $[-11+1,3+1] = \\boxed{[-10,4]}$.",

        "Here's how to find the range of g(x):\n**1. Understand the transformations:**\n* **Vertical shift:** Adding 1 to  *f(6x)* shifts the graph of *f(x)* upward by 1 unit.\n* **Horizontal compression:** Multiplying the input by 6 compresses the graph of *f(x)* horizontally by a factor of 1/6.\n**2. Apply the transformations to the range:**\n* **Vertical shift:**  The original range of *f(x)* is [-11, 3]. Shifting it upward by 1 unit gives us [-10, 4].\n* **Horizontal compression:**  The horizontal compression doesn't affect the range of the function.  \n**3. The range of g(x):**\nSince the range only changes due to the vertical shift, the range of *g(x)* is **[-10, 4]**. \n",
        "Here's how to determine the range of  g(x):\n**1. Understand the Transformations**\n* **Horizontal Compression:** The transformation `f(6x)` compresses the graph of *f(x)* horizontally by a factor of 1/6. This doesn't change the range, as it only affects the x-values.\n* **Vertical Shift:** The transformation `f(6x) + 1` shifts the graph of *f(x)* upward by 1 unit. This directly affects the range.\n**2.  Apply the Transformations to the Range**\n* The original range of *f(x)* is [-11, 3].\n* Shifting the range upward by 1 unit gives us a new range of [-11 + 1, 3 + 1] = **[-10, 4]**.\n**Therefore, the range of g(x) is [-10, 4].** \n",
        "Here's how to find the range of  $g(x)$:\n* **Understanding Transformations:** The function $g(x)$ is obtained from $f(x)$ by two transformations:\n    * **Horizontal compression:**  The $6x$ inside the function compresses the graph horizontally by a factor of $\\frac{1}{6}$. \n    * **Vertical shift:** The $+1$ outside the function shifts the graph vertically upwards by 1 unit.\n* **Range of $f(x)$:**  We know the range of $f(x)$ is $[-11, 3]$. This means the output values of $f(x)$ lie between -11 and 3.\n* **Effect of Transformations on Range:** \n    * **Horizontal compression:** This transformation does not affect the range. The output values will still be between -11 and 3.\n    * **Vertical shift:**  The vertical shift upwards by 1 unit means we add 1 to every output value of $f(x)$.  Therefore, the range of $g(x)$ is $[-11 + 1, 3 + 1] = [-10, 4]$.\n**Therefore, the range of $g(x)$ is  [-10, 4].** \n",
        "Here's how to find the range of  g(x):\n* **Understanding Transformations:** The function g(x) is a transformation of f(x). It involves two changes:\n    * **Horizontal Compression:** The term `6x` inside the function compresses the graph of f(x) horizontally by a factor of 1/6.\n    * **Vertical Shift:** The addition of 1 shifts the graph of f(x) upward by 1 unit.\n* **Effect on Range:**\n    * The horizontal compression doesn't affect the range of the function. It only changes how the function is stretched horizontally.\n    * The vertical shift of 1 unit increases every output value of f(x) by 1.\n* **Finding the New Range:** Since the range of f(x) is [-11, 3], shifting it up by 1 unit gives us a new range of **[-10, 4]**.\n**Therefore, the range of g(x) is [-10, 4].** \n",
