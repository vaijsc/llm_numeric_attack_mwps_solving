        "Here's how to compute 91\u00b2 in your head:\n1. **Recognize the pattern:** 91 is close to 100.  Think of it as (100 - 9).\n2. **Square the difference:** 9\u00b2 = 81.\n3. **Double the difference and multiply by the base number:** 2 * 9 * 100 = 1800\n4. **Subtract the result from the square of the base number:** 100\u00b2 - 1800 = 8200\n5. **Add the square of the difference:** 8200 + 81 = 8281\n**Therefore, 91\u00b2 = 8281** \n",
