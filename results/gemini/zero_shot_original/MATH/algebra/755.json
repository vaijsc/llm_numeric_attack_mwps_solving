        "We can expand this expression using the distributive property (sometimes called FOIL):\n1. **Multiply the first terms of each binomial:**  \n   *  (q) * (3r) = 3qr\n2. **Multiply the outer terms of the binomials:**\n   * (q) * (6) = 6q\n3. **Multiply the inner terms of the binomials:**\n   * (-5) * (3r) = -15r\n4. **Multiply the last terms of each binomial:**\n   * (-5) * (6) = -30\n5. **Combine all the terms:**\n   * 3qr + 6q - 15r - 30\n**Therefore, the expanded form of (q - 5)(3r + 6) is 3qr + 6q - 15r - 30.** \n",
