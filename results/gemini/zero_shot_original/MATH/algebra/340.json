    "solution": "Recall that for positive integers $a$ and $b$ $x^a x^b = x^{a+b}$.  Thus, if $h(x)$, $f(x)$, and $g(x)$ are polynomials such that $h(x)=f(x) \\cdot g(x)$ and if $ x^a $ and $ x^b $ are the highest degree terms of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ then the highest degree term of $h(x)$ will be $x^{a+b}$.  In our case $f(x) = x^2-7x+10$, the highest degree term is $x^2$ and $h(x)$ has highest degree term $x^5$.  Thus, solving for $b$ in the equation $x^5 = x^2 x^b = x^{2+b}$, we find $b=\\boxed{3}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n* **Understanding Degree:** The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of the variable in the polynomial. For example, the degree of $x^3 + 2x - 1$ is 3.\n* **Multiplication of Polynomials:** When you multiply polynomials, the degree of the resulting polynomial is the sum of the degrees of the original polynomials.\n**Let's apply this to our problem:**\n1. **Degree of  (x\u00b2 - 7x + 10):** The degree of this polynomial is 2.\n2. **Degree of h(x):** We know that h(x) is a polynomial of degree 5.\n3. **Degree of g(x):**  Since  h(x) = (x\u00b2 - 7x + 10) * g(x), the degree of h(x) is the sum of the degrees of (x\u00b2 - 7x + 10) and g(x). \n4. **Solving for b:**  Therefore, 5 (degree of h(x)) = 2 (degree of (x\u00b2 - 7x + 10)) + b (degree of g(x)).  Solving for b, we get:\n   * 5 = 2 + b\n   * b = 3\n**Answer:** The degree of g(x) is **b = 3**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Understanding the Problem**\n* We know  *h(x)* is a polynomial of degree 5.
