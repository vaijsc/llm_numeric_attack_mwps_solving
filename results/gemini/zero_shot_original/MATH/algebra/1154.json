    "solution": "Consider the point $(x,y)$. Then, he labels the point with the number $$(\\sqrt{(x-0)^2 + (y-0)^2})^2 = x^2 + y^2,$$ so it follows that $x^2 + y^2 = 25$. From here, some casework needs to be done to find the number of pairs $(x,y)$ that satisfy $x^2 + y^2 = 25$. We note that $x^2 = 25 - y^2 \\le 25 \\Longrightarrow |x| \\le 5$, and so $|x|$ can only be equal to $0,1,2,3,4,5$. Of these, only $0,3,4,5$ produce integer solutions for $|y|$.\n\nIf $|x| = 3$, then $|y| = 4$, and any of the four combinations $(3,4)(-3,4)(3,-4)(-3,-4)$ work. Similarly, if $|x| = 4, |y| = 3$, there are four feasible distinct combinations.\n\nIf $|x| = 0$, then $|y| = 5$, but then there is only one possible value for $x$, and so there are only two combinations that work: $(0,5)$ and $(0,-5)$. Similarly, if $|x| = 5, |y| = 0$, there are two feasible distinct combinations.\nIn total, there are $\\boxed{12}$ possible pairs of integer coordinates that are labeled with $25$.",

Find the Distance Formula:**\nThe distance formula is based on the Pythagorean theorem:\n* Distance = \u221a((x2 - x1)\u00b2 + (y2 - y1)\u00b2)\nIn this case, (x1, y1) is the origin (0, 0), and (x2, y2) is any lattice point. So the distance formula simplifies to:\n* Distance = \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)\n**3. Find Lattice Points with Distance Squared Equal to 25:**\nWe want the points where:\n* x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 25\nThink about the factors of 25: 1, 5, and 25.

        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n* **Lattice Points:** These are points on the coordinate plane where both the x-coordinate and y-coordinate are integers (whole numbers).  Examples: (1,2), (-3,0), (5,5).\n* **Distance from the Origin:**  The origin is the point (0,0). We need to find the distance between a lattice point and the origin.\n* **Square of the Distance:**  We need to square the distance we find.\n**Finding the Points:**\n1. **Think about the Pythagorean Theorem:**  The distance from a point (x,y) to the origin is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of length |x| and |y|. So, the distance squared is  x\u00b2 + y\u00b2.\n2. **We want the distance squared to be 25:** We need to find integer values of x and y that satisfy the equation:  x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 25.\n3. **Find the possibilities:**\n   * **x = 0:**  This gives us y\u00b2 = 25, so y = 5 or y = -5.  We have two points: (0, 5) and (0, -5).\n   * **x = 1:** This gives us y\u00b2 = 24. There are no integer solutions for y.\n   * **x = 2:** This gives us y\u00b2 = 21. There are no integer solutions for y.\n   * **x = 3:**  This gives us y\u00b2 = 16, so y = 4 or y = -4.
