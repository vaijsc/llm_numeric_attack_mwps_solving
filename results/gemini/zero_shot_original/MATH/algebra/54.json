    "solution": "Letting $t$ equal the number of tickets sold in a single order, we get the following inequality: \\begin{align*} 4200&<(70-(t-60))(t)\n\\\\4200&<(130-t)(t)\n\\\\4200&<130t-t^2\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad t^2-130t+4200&<0\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad (t-60)(t-70)&<0\n\\end{align*}Since the two roots of the left-hand side are 60 and 70, the inequality must change sign at these two points. For $t<60$, both factors of the inequality are negative, thus making it positive. For $60<t<70$, only $t-70$ is negative, so the inequality is negative. Finally, for $t>70$, both factors are positive, making the inequality positive once again. This tells us that the range of $t$ that will result in a profit greater than $\\$4200$ is $(60,70)$. Since the number of tickets purchased in one order must be an integer, the largest number of tickets which brings a profit greater than $\\$4200$ is $t=\\boxed{69}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Define the Revenue Function:**\n* **For 0 \u2264 t \u2264 60:**  The revenue is simply the number of tickets times the price per ticket:  Revenue = 70t\n* **For t > 60:** The price per ticket decreases by $1 for each ticket beyond 60.  Let's express this:\n    * Price per ticket = 70 - (t - 60) = 130 - t\n**2. Set up the Inequality for Profit:**\n* **Profit = Revenue - Cost**\n* We're not given the cost of each ticket, so we'll assume the amusement park needs to make a profit of at least $4200.  We'll set up the inequality for each case:\n    * **Case 1 (0 \u2264 t \u2264 60):**  70t - Cost > 4200\n    * **Case 2 (t > 60):** (130 - t)t - Cost > 4200\n**3. Analyze the Inequality for Case 1:**\n* 70t - Cost > 4200\n* Since we don't know the cost, we can't solve for a specific value of t.  However, we can see that the profit increases as t increases. This means the maximum profit in this case will occur when t = 60.\n**4. Analyze the Inequality for Case 2:**\n* (130 - t)t - Cost > 4200\n* This is a quadratic inequality. Let's simplify it and analyze:\n    * 130t - t\u00b2 - Cost > 4200\n    * -t\u00b2 + 130t - (4200 + Cost) > 0\n* To find the maximum value of t that satisfies this inequality, we need to find the vertex of the parabola represented by the quadratic.  The x-coordinate of the vertex is given by:  x = -b / 2a, where a = -1 and b = 130. \n* x = -130 / (2 * -1) = 65 \n**5. Interpret the Results:**\n* Case 1:  The maximum profit in this case occurs when t = 60.\n* Case 2:  The maximum profit in this case occurs when t = 65.\n* Since the profit is likely higher for t = 65 (the vertex of the quadratic in Case 2), **the largest value of t that brings the amusement park a profit greater than $4200 is t = 65.**\n**Important Note:** This solution assumes that the cost per ticket is constant.  If the cost per ticket varies, the exact maximum value of t might be different. \n",

This can be expressed as 70 - (t - 60).\n   * The revenue is then: (70 - (t - 60)) * t = (130 - t) * t \n**2. Define the Profit Function**\n* Profit = Revenue - Cost\n* We don't know the cost of each ticket for the amusement park, so we'll assume the cost is constant (let's call it 'c').\n* **Case 1: t \u2264 60**\n   * Profit = 70t - ct\n* **Case 2: t > 60**\n   * Profit = (130 - t) * t - ct\n**3.

Let's set up the inequality for each case:\n    * **Case 1: t \u2264 60**\n        * 70t - ct > 4200\n    * **Case 2: t > 60**\n        * (130 - t) * t - ct > 4200\n**4. Solve for t in each Case**\n* **Case 1: t \u2264 60**\n    *  We need more information (the cost 'c') to solve this inequality explicitly. \n* **Case 2: t > 60**\n    * (130 - t) * t - ct > 4200\n    * 130t - t\u00b2 - ct > 4200\n    * -t\u00b2 + (130 - c)t - 4200 > 0\n**5. Analyze Case 2 Inequality**\n* The inequality in Case 2 is a quadratic. To find the largest possible 't' that satisfies the inequality, we need to:\n    * **Find the roots of the quadratic:**  This involves using the quadratic formula (or factoring if possible). The roots will give us the points where the quadratic crosses the x-axis.\n    * **Determine the interval where the quadratic is greater than zero:**  The solution will be the interval between the roots where the quadratic is positive.\n**6. Find the Maximum 't'**\n* Once you find the interval where the quadratic is positive, the largest possible 't' that satisfies the inequality will be the upper bound of that interval.\n**Important Notes:**\n* **We need the cost per ticket (c) to solve for 't' explicitly.** Without this information, we can only find the interval where the profit is greater than $4200 in terms of 'c'.\n* **The solution might involve a range of values for 't'.**  The amusement park will need to analyze this range and determine the largest 't' that is feasible for them (considering factors like demand, capacity, etc.). \n",

This means the price per ticket is 70 - (t - 60) = 130 - t. \n   * Revenue = (130 - t) * t\n**2. Define the Cost Function**\nWe don't have information about the amusement park's cost per ticket. We can assume a constant cost per ticket (let's call it 'c') for simplicity. The total cost would then be: Cost = ct\n**3. Define the Profit Function**\nProfit = Revenue - Cost\n* **For t \u2264 60:** Profit = 70t - ct\n* **For t > 60:** Profit = (130 - t)t - ct\n**4.

Solve the Inequalities**\n* **For t \u2264 60:** \n   * We don't know the value of 'c' (cost per ticket), so we can't solve this inequality directly. However, we can see that the profit will increase as 't' increases (as long as 'c' is less than 70). \n* **For t > 60:**\n   * (130 - t)t - ct > 4200\n   * 130t - t\u00b2 - ct > 4200\n   * -t\u00b2 + (130 - c)t - 4200 > 0 \nWe need to solve this quadratic inequality. \n**6. Analyze the Quadratic Inequality**\nTo find the maximum 't' that satisfies this inequality, we can do the following:\n* **Find the roots:**  Use the quadratic formula to find the roots of the equation -t\u00b2 + (130 - c)t - 4200 = 0. \n* **Determine the sign of the quadratic:** The quadratic is negative for values of 't' between its roots.\n* **Find the maximum 't':**  The largest 't' that satisfies the inequality will be the smaller root of the quadratic.\n**7. Need More Information**\nWe can't find a specific numerical answer for the maximum 't' without knowing the value of 'c' (the cost per ticket). \n**In Conclusion:**\nTo find the largest 't' that results in a profit greater than $4200, we need to know the cost per ticket ('c'). With the cost per ticket, we can solve the quadratic inequality and find the maximum number of tickets that will yield the desired profit. \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Define the Revenue Function:**\n* **For 0 \u2264 t \u2264 60:**  The revenue is simply the number of tickets * the price per ticket:  R(t) = 70t \n* **For t > 60:**  The price per ticket decreases by $1 for each ticket over 60. This means the price per ticket is 70 - (t - 60) = 130 - t. The revenue function becomes: R(t) = (130 - t) * t\n**2. Define the Profit Function:**\n* **Profit = Revenue - Cost** \n* We are not given the cost of each ticket, but we know the park wants a profit greater than $4200.  \n**3. Analyze the Profit for t \u2264 60:**\n* **Profit for t \u2264 60:**  We don't know the cost, but let's assume the cost per ticket is 'c'. The profit would be: P(t) = 70t - ct. To have a profit greater than $4200, we need: 70t - ct > 4200. This means the maximum number of tickets at the standard price to achieve this profit depends on the cost 'c'. \n**4. Analyze the Profit for t > 60:**\n* **Profit for t > 60:** The profit function is: P(t) = (130 - t) * t - ct \n**5. Find the Maximum Profit Point:**\n* To find the largest possible 't' that yields a profit greater than $4200, we need to find the maximum point of the profit function for t > 60. \n* This involves finding the vertex of the parabola represented by the profit function P(t) = (130 - t) * t - ct.  Since the coefficient of the t\u00b2 term is negative, the parabola opens downwards, meaning the vertex is the maximum point.\n* The x-coordinate of the vertex of a parabola in the form ax\u00b2 + bx + c is given by -b/2a. In our case, the x-coordinate (which represents 't') is -(-130)/(2 * -1) = 65.\n**6. Check if t = 65 Satisfies the Profit Condition:**\n* **For t = 65:** We know the price per ticket is 130 - 65 = 65.\n*  We need to make sure the profit at t = 65 is greater than $4200.  \n*  Profit at t = 65 = (65 * 65) - 65c. We need to make sure this is greater than 4200:  4225 - 65c > 4200. \n*  This simplifies to: 25 > 65c. \n*  Therefore, c must be less than 25/65 for the profit to be greater than $4200 when t = 65.\n**7. Conclusion:**\n* We found that the maximum profit occurs at t = 65 when the price per ticket is $65. \n* However, the exact value of 't' that maximizes profit depends on the cost per ticket ('c'). \n* If the cost per ticket ('c') is less than 25/65, then the maximum 't' that yields a profit greater than $4200 is t = 65. \n* If the cost per ticket ('c') is greater than 25/65, then the maximum 't' that yields a profit greater than $4200 might be a value less than 65. \n",

So, the price per ticket is: 70 - (t - 60) = 130 - t \n   The revenue is: R(t) = (130 - t)t\n**2.  Define the Profit Function:**\n* Profit is calculated as Revenue - Cost. We are not given a cost per ticket, so we'll assume the cost is constant.  Let's say the cost per ticket is 'c'.  Then the total cost is ct.\n* **Case 1: t \u2264 60**\n    Profit: P(t) = 70t - ct\n* **Case 2: t > 60**\n    Profit: P(t) = (130 - t)t - ct\n**3.  Set up the Inequality:**\nWe want to find the largest 't' for which the profit is greater than $4200.  \n* **Case 1: t \u2264 60**\n    70t - ct > 4200\n* **Case 2: t > 60**\n    (130 - t)t - ct > 4200\n**4.  Solve the Inequalities:**\nWe need to solve each inequality separately. Since we don't know the value of 'c', we can't get a precise numerical solution for 't'.  However, we can find a range of values.\n* **Case 1: t \u2264 60**\n   70t - ct > 4200\n   t(70 - c) > 4200\n   t > 4200 / (70 - c) \n   Since 'c' is the cost per ticket, it's likely less than $70.  Therefore, the denominator (70 - c) is positive. This means as 'c' gets smaller, the right side of the inequality gets larger, and thus 't' can be larger.\n* **Case 2: t > 60**\n   (130 - t)t - ct > 4200\n   130t - t^2 - ct > 4200\n   t^2 - (130 - c)t + 4200 < 0 \n   This is a quadratic inequality. To find the range of 't' that satisfies it, we would need to factor the quadratic or use the quadratic formula.  The solution will depend on the value of 'c'.\n**5. Find the Maximum 't':**\nWe need to find the largest possible 't' that satisfies either of the inequalities.  \n* **Case 1:**  The larger 'c' is (closer to $70), the smaller 't' needs to be to satisfy the inequality.  \n* **Case 2:**  The solution depends on 'c' and the quadratic inequality. We need more information about the cost per ticket to find a precise solution.\n**Conclusion:**\nWithout knowing the cost per ticket ('c'), we cannot determine the exact largest value of 't' that will yield a profit greater than $4200.  However, we've established the relationship between 't' and 'c' and shown how to find the solution for specific cost values. \n"
