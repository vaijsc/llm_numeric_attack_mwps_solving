        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n1. **Understand the operation:** The problem defines a new operation \"*\" that combines two positive integers.  The operation is defined as  *a * b = a^b + b^a* \n2. **Substitute the values:** We are asked to find the value of *2 * 6*.  This means we need to substitute *a = 2* and *b = 6* into the definition of the operation.\n3. **Calculate:** \n   *  2 * 6 = 2^6 + 6^2 \n   *  2^6 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 64\n   *  6^2 = 6 * 6 = 36\n   *  2^6 + 6^2 = 64 + 36 = 100\n**Therefore, 2 * 6 = 100** \n",
