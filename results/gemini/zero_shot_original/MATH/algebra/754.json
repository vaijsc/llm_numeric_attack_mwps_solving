    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "First we factor $x^2-8x-33$ into $(x-11)(x+3)$. So, $y=0$ at $x=-3$ or $x=11$. The quantity produced must be a positive amount, so that means the company breaks even (making no money) at $x=\\boxed{11}$ and begins to make a profit after that point ($y>0$).",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step by step:\n**1. Understand \"Break Even\"**\n*  Breaking even means the company is making zero profit. This happens when the revenue (money earned) equals the cost (money spent).  In the equation given, the y-value represents the profit. \n**2. Find the x-intercepts**\n* The x-intercepts of the graph represent the points where y = 0.  These are the points where the company breaks even (zero profit). \n* To find the x-intercepts, we need to solve the quadratic equation: \n   *  x\u00b2 - 8x - 33 = 0\n**3. Factor the Quadratic**\n* Factor the equation: (x - 11)(x + 3) = 0\n*  This gives us two possible solutions:\n    * x - 11 = 0  -->  x = 11\n    * x + 3 = 0   -->  x = -3\n**4. Interpret the Solution**\n*  Since we can't produce a negative quantity, x = -3 is not a valid solution. \n*  Therefore, x = 11 is the smallest quantity the company can produce to break even.\n**5.  Consider Profit**\n* To make a profit, the company needs to produce more than the break-even point. \n**Answer:**\nThe smallest quantity the company can produce to break even or make a profit is **11**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Problem:**\n* The equation  *y* = *x*\u00b2 - 8*x* - 33 represents the company's profit (or loss) based on the quantity produced (*x*).\n*  We want to find the smallest quantity (*x*) where the company starts making a profit or at least breaks even (meaning zero profit).\n**2. Break-Even Point:**\n*  Breaking even means the profit is zero (y = 0).  \n**3. Solve the Equation:**\n* Set the profit equation equal to zero:  0 = *x*\u00b2 - 8*x* - 33\n*  We need to find the roots (solutions) of this quadratic equation.  We can do this by factoring or using the quadratic formula.\n**4. Factoring the Quadratic:**\n*  Find two numbers that multiply to -33 and add up to -8.  These numbers are -11 and 3.\n*  Factor the equation: (x - 11)(x + 3) = 0\n*  Set each factor equal to zero:\n     *  x - 11 = 0  =>  x = 11\n     *  x + 3 = 0   =>  x = -3\n**5. Interpret the Solutions:**\n*  We have two solutions: x = 11 and x = -3.\n*  Since quantity produced cannot be negative, we discard x = -3.\n**6. The Answer:**\n*  The smallest quantity the company can produce to break even or make a profit is **x = 11**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Equation:**\n* The equation  *y = x\u00b2 - 8x - 33* represents the company's profit (or loss) as a function of the quantity produced (x). \n* When *y* is positive, the company makes a profit.\n* When *y* is negative, the company experiences a loss.\n* When *y* is zero, the company breaks even.\n**2. Find the Break-Even Points:**\n* To find the break-even points, we need to find the values of *x* where *y = 0*. \n* Set the equation equal to zero: *x\u00b2 - 8x - 33 = 0*\n**3. Solve the Quadratic Equation:**\n*  We can solve this quadratic equation by factoring or using the quadratic formula.  Let's use factoring:\n   * (x - 11)(x + 3) = 0\n   * This gives us two solutions: x = 11 and x = -3\n**4. Interpret the Solutions:**\n*  Since we're dealing with quantity produced, *x* cannot be negative. Therefore, *x = -3* is not a valid solution.\n* This leaves us with *x = 11*. This means the company needs to produce 11 units to break even.\n**5. The Answer:**\n*  The smallest quantity at which the company can produce to break even or make a profit is **11 units**.  Producing more than 11 units will result in a profit. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n* **Break-even:**  The company breaks even when its revenue (money earned) equals its costs (money spent).  This means the profit is zero.\n* **Profit:**  The company makes a profit when its revenue is greater than its costs. This means the profit is positive.\n* **The Equation:** The equation  *y* = *x*\u00b2 - 8*x* - 33 represents the company's profit (or loss if *y* is negative) as a function of the quantity produced (*x*).\n**2. Find the Break-Even Points**\n* To find the break-even points, we need to find the values of *x* where the profit (*y*) is zero.  So, we need to solve the equation:\n   *x*\u00b2 - 8*x* - 33 = 0\n**3. Solve the Quadratic Equation**\n* We can solve this quadratic equation by factoring:\n   ( *x* - 11)(*x* + 3) = 0\n* This gives us two possible solutions:\n   * *x* = 11\n   * *x* = -3\n**4. Interpret the Solutions**\n*  The solution *x* = -3 doesn't make sense in this context because you can't produce a negative quantity.\n*  The solution *x* = 11 means the company breaks even when they produce 11 units.\n**5. Determine the Smallest Quantity for Profit**\n* Since the profit is represented by the equation *y* = *x*\u00b2 - 8*x* - 33, the graph of this equation is a parabola.\n* Parabolas are symmetrical.  Since the company breaks even at *x* = 11, the profit will be positive for any quantity *x* greater than 11.\n**Answer:**\nThe smallest quantity the company can produce to break even or make a profit is **11 units**. \n",
