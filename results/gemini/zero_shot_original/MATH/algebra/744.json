        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Analyze the first equation:**\n* We know that $\\frac{12 \\star 2}{9 * 3} = 4$. \n* This means the numerator ($12 \\star 2$) must be four times larger than the denominator ($9 * 3$).\n**2. Consider the possible operations:**\n* **For the numerator (12 \u22c6 2):**\n    *  Addition (+): 12 + 2 = 14\n    *  Subtraction (-): 12 - 2 = 10\n    *  Multiplication (\u00d7): 12 \u00d7 2 = 24\n    *  Division (\u00f7): 12 \u00f7 2 = 6 \n* **For the denominator (9 * 3):**\n    *  Addition (+): 9 + 3 = 12\n    *  Subtraction (-): 9 - 3 = 6\n    *  Multiplication (\u00d7): 9 \u00d7 3 = 27\n    *  Division (\u00f7): 9 \u00f7 3 = 3\n**3. Find the matching operations:**\n* The only combination that gives a numerator four times larger than the denominator is:\n    *  **12 \u00d7 2 = 24**  (numerator)\n    *  **9 \u00d7 3 = 27**  (denominator) \n**4. Apply the same operations to the second equation:**\n*  Therefore, **\u22c6** represents multiplication (\u00d7) and ** * ** represents multiplication (\u00d7)\n*  We have:  $\\frac{10 \\times 7}{24 \\times 9}$\n**5. Simplify:**\n* $\\frac{10 \\times 7}{24 \\times 9} = \\frac{70}{216} = \\boxed{\\frac{35}{108}}$ \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Analyze the given equation:**\n* We know that  `12 * 2 / 9 * 3 = 4`. \n* This means the operations represented by `*` and `*` must combine to produce a result of 4 when applied to the numbers 12, 2, 9, and 3.\n**2. Experiment with operations:**\n* Let's try different combinations of operations:\n    * If `*` represents `+` and `*` represents `*`, we get `(12 + 2) / (9 * 3) = 14 / 27`, which is not equal to 4.\n    * If `*` represents `-` and `*` represents `/`, we get `(12 - 2) / (9 / 3) = 10 / 3`, which is not equal to 4.\n    * If `*` represents `*` and `*` represents `-`, we get `(12 * 2) / (9 - 3) = 24 / 6 = 4`.  This works!\n**3. Determine the operations:**\n* We found that `*` represents `*` (multiplication) and `*` represents `-` (subtraction).\n**4. Apply the operations to the new expression:**\n* Now we need to find the value of `(10 * 7) / (24 - 9)`.\n*  This simplifies to `70 / 15`.\n**5. Simplify the fraction:**\n* The fraction `70/15` can be simplified to `14/3`.\n**Answer:** The value of  `10 * 7 / 24 * 9` is **14/3**. \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem:\n**1. Analyze the given equation:**\nWe know  \n  \n  $\\frac{12 \\star 2}{9 * 3} = 4$\n**2.  Consider the possibilities:**\n* **Focus on the denominator:**  The denominator simplifies to 27. To get 4 as the result, the numerator must be 108. This suggests that the operation * in the denominator is likely multiplication.\n* **Focus on the numerator:**  The numerator must equal 108 if * is multiplication. This means the operation $\\star$ is likely addition, since 12 + 2 = 14, and 14 multiplied by a factor of 7.71...  would give us 108.\n**3.  Test our assumptions:**\nLet's assume * represents multiplication and $\\star$ represents addition.\n*  $\\frac{12 + 2}{9 \\times 3} = \\frac{14}{27} \\neq 4$  \n**4.  Adjust our thinking:**\nSince our initial assumptions don't work, we need to consider other possibilities. Notice that if we use division for $\\star$, we can get a result of 4:\n*  $\\frac{12 \\div 2}{9 * 3} = \\frac{6}{27} = \\frac{2}{9} \\times \\frac{3}{3} = \\frac{2}{9} \\times 1 = \\frac{2}{9} $\n**5.  Apply the operations to the second equation:**\nNow, let's apply division for $\\star$ and multiplication for * to the second equation:\n*  $\\frac{10 \\div 7}{24 \\times 9} = \\frac{10/7}{216}$\n**6.  Simplify the fraction:**\n* $\\frac{10/7}{216} = \\frac{10}{7} \\times \\frac{1}{216} = \\boxed{\\frac{5}{756}}$ \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Analyze the given equation:**\nWe know  $\\frac{12\\star 2}{9*3}=4$.  Let's simplify the right side of the equation:\n*  $\\frac{12\\star 2}{9*3} = 4 = \\frac{12}{3}$\n**2.  Deduce the operations:**\n* **The denominator:** To get 3 in the denominator, we must have $9 * 3 = 3$.  This means $*$ represents the division operation (\u00f7).\n* **The numerator:** To get 12 in the numerator, we must have $12 \\star 2 = 12$. This means $\\star$ represents the subtraction operation (-).\n**3.  Apply the operations to the new expression:**\nNow we have:\n*  $\\frac{10\\star 7}{24*9} = \\frac{10 - 7}{24 \\div 9}$\n**4.  Simplify the expression:**\n*  $\\frac{10 - 7}{24 \\div 9} = \\frac{3}{ \\frac{8}{3}} = 3 \\times \\frac{3}{8} = \\boxed{\\frac{9}{8}}$ \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Analyze the given equation:**\n* We know that $\\frac{12 \\star 2}{9 * 3} = 4$.\n* The numerator and denominator must simplify to values that result in 4 when divided.\n**2.  Consider possible operations:**\n* **Numerator (12 * 2):**  The only operation that works here is multiplication: 12 * 2 = 24\n* **Denominator (9 * 3):**  Again, the only operation that works is multiplication: 9 * 3 = 27\n* **Division:** 24 / 27 simplifies to 8/9, which is not equal to 4.\n**3.  Deduce the operations:**\n* Since we need a result of 4, the only way to achieve this is if the division is actually a subtraction.\n* This means: $\\star$ represents subtraction and $*$ represents multiplication.\n**4.  Apply the operations to the second expression:**\n* Numerator: 10 - 7 = 3\n* Denominator: 24 * 9 = 216\n* Result: 3 / 216 = **1/72** \n**Therefore, the value of  $\\frac{10 \\star 7}{24 * 9}$ is  1/72.** \n"
