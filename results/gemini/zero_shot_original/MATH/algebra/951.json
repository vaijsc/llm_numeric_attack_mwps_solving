        "Here's how to solve this problem step by step:\n**1. Understand Inverse Functions**\n* If  *g(x)* is the inverse of *f(x)*, then  *f(g(x)) = x* for all values of *x* in the domain of *g(x)*.  Similarly, *g(f(x)) = x* for all values of *x* in the domain of *f(x)*.\n**2. Use the Given Information**\nWe are given that *g(-15) = 0*.  Applying the inverse property, this tells us:\n*  *f(g(-15)) = -15* \n*  *f(0) = -15*  (since *g(-15) = 0*)\nSimilarly, we can find:\n*  *f(3) = 0* (since *g(0) = 3*)\n*  *f(9) = 3* (since *g(3) = 9*)\n*  *f(20) = 9* (since *g(9) = 20*)\n**3.
