    "solution": "For the simple interest rate, she would have to pay an interest of $10000 \\cdot 0.07=700$ dollars every year. Since there are $5$ years, in the end she would have to pay back $10000+5\\cdot 700=13500$ dollars.\n\nFor the compounded interest, her balance is multiplied by $1+6\\%=1.06$ each year. Therefore, at the end of 5 years her balance is $A=10000(1+0.06)^5=13382.255..$.\n\nThe simple interest rate would be more expensive by $13500-13382.255 \\approx \\boxed{118 \\text{ dollars}}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Calculate the simple interest:**\n* Simple interest = Principal * Rate * Time\n* Simple interest = $10,000 * 0.07 * 5 = $3,500\n**2. Calculate the total amount paid back with simple interest:**\n* Total amount = Principal + Simple Interest\n* Total amount = $10,000 + $3,500 = $13,500\n**3. Calculate the compound interest:**\n* Compound interest formula: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt) \n    * A = the future value of the investment/loan, including interest\n    * P = the principal investment amount (the initial deposit or loan amount)\n    * r = the annual interest rate (as a decimal)\n    * n = the number of times that interest is compounded per year\n    * t = the number of years the money is invested or borrowed for\n* A = $10,000(1 + 0.06/1)^(1*5) \n* A = $10,000(1.06)^5 \n* A \u2248 $13,382.26\n**4. Determine the difference in total cost:**\n* Difference = Total cost of compound interest - Total cost of simple interest\n* Difference = $13,382.26 - $13,500 = -$117.74\n**5. Round to the nearest dollar:**\n* Sue would pay approximately **$118** less for the compound interest option.\n**Answer:** Sue would have to pay approximately **$118** less for the less expensive interest. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Calculate the simple interest:**\n* Simple interest per year: $10,000 * 0.07 = $700\n* Total simple interest over 5 years: $700 * 5 = $3500\n* Total amount to be paid back with simple interest: $10,000 + $3500 = $13,500\n**2. Calculate the compound interest:**\n* Compound interest for the first year: $10,000 * 0.06 = $600\n* Balance after the first year: $10,000 + $600 = $10,600\n* Compound interest for the second year: $10,600 * 0.06 = $636\n* Balance after the second year: $10,600 + $636 = $11,236\n* Continue this process for the remaining years:\n    * Year 3: $11,236 * 0.06 = $674.16 (rounded to the nearest cent)\n    * Year 4: $11,910.16 * 0.06 = $714.61\n    * Year 5: $12,624.77 * 0.06 = $757.49\n    * Year 6: $13,382.26 * 0.06 = $802.94 \n* Total amount to be paid back with compound interest: $13,382.26 + $802.94 = $14,185.20\n**3.
