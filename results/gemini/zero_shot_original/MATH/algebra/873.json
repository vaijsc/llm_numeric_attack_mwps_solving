        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n1. **Calculate the floor of 52/3:**\n   * 52 divided by 3 is approximately 17.33.\n   * The floor function, denoted by  \u230a \u230b, gives the greatest integer less than or equal to the input. Therefore,  \u230a52/3\u230b = 17.\n2. **Calculate the division of the floor by 5/23:**\n   * 17 divided by 5/23 is the same as multiplying 17 by the reciprocal of 5/23, which is 23/5.\n   * (17) * (23/5) = 78.2\n3. **Calculate the ceiling of 78.2:**\n   * The ceiling function, denoted by \u2308 \u2309, gives the smallest integer greater than or equal to the input. Therefore, \u230878.2\u2309 = 79.\n**Therefore,  $\\left \\lceil \\frac{\\left \\lfloor 52/3 \\right. \\rfloor}{5/23} \\right \\rceil = 79$.** \n",
