    "solution": "Suppose that the dimensions of the rectangular prism are given by $x$, $y$, and $z$, such that $xy = 30, yz = 180,$ and $zx = 24$. If we multiply all three equations together, we get that $xy \\cdot yz \\cdot zx = (xyz)^2 = 30 \\cdot 180 \\cdot 24$. Using prime factorizations, we find that the right-hand side is equal to $(2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5) \\times (2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5) \\times (2^3 \\cdot 3) = 2^6 \\cdot 3^4 \\cdot 5^2$. Thus, $(xyz)^2 = (2^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5)^2$, so $xyz = \\boxed{360}$. This is the formula for the volume of the box.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n* **Right Rectangular Prism:** A box-shaped solid with six rectangular faces.\n* **Integer Edge Lengths:** All sides of the prism are whole numbers.\n* **Face Areas:** We're given the areas of three of the faces: 30, 180, and 24 square centimeters.\n**2. Set Up Equations**\nLet the edges of the prism be *l*, *w*, and *h*.  We can represent the given face areas with equations:\n*  *l* *w* = 30 \n*  *l* *h* = 180\n*  *w* *h* = 24\n**3. Find the Factors**\n* **Factor each area:** Find the pairs of integers that multiply to give the given areas.\n    * 30: (1, 30), (2, 15), (3, 10), (5, 6)\n    * 180: (1, 180), (2, 90), (3, 60), (4, 45), (5, 36), (6, 30), (9, 20), (10, 18), (12, 15)\n    * 24: (1, 24), (2, 12), (3, 8), (4, 6)\n**4. Match Factors**\n* **Look for common factors:**  Notice that the factors (6, 5) appear in the factorizations of 30 and 180. This suggests that *l* = 6 and *h* = 5.\n* **Verify with the remaining equation:**  Since *w* *h* = 24, and we know *h* = 5, then *w* = 24/5 = 4.8.  However, this is not an integer, so our initial guess was incorrect. \n* **Try another combination:** Notice that the factors (3, 8) appear in the factorizations of 24 and 180. This suggests that *w* = 3 and *h* = 8.\n* **Verify:** \n    * *l* *w* = 30,  and we know *w* = 3, so *l* = 30/3 = 10\n    * *l* *h* = 180, and we know *l* = 10 and *h* = 8, so this equation holds true.\n**5. Calculate the Volume**\n* **Volume = l * w * h** \n* Volume = 10 * 3 * 8 = 240\n**Answer:** The volume of the right rectangular prism is **240 cubic centimeters**. \n",

Understand the Problem**\n* We have a rectangular prism (like a box).\n* We know the areas of three of its faces.\n* We need to find the volume of the prism.\n**2. Set Up Equations**\nLet the edge lengths of the prism be  *a*, *b*, and *c*.
