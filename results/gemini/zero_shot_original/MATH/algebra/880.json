    "solution": "We know that $y=-6$ from the given information. By the distance formula, we have the equation $\\sqrt{(x-8)^2+(-6-3)^2}=15$. Solving, we have \\begin{align*}\n\\sqrt{(x-8)^2+(-6-3)^2}&=15 \\\\\nx^2-16x+64+81&=225 \\\\\nx^2-16x-80&=0 \\\\\n(x-20)(x+4)&=0\n\\end{align*}Thus, $x+4=0$ or $x-20=0$, so $x=-4$ or $x=20$. $x=-4$ by the given conditions. Thus, our point is $(-4,-6)$ and is a distance of $\\sqrt{(-4)^2+(-6)^2}=\\sqrt{52}$ units from the origin. $n=\\boxed{52}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Information:**\n* **Negative Coordinates:** The point (x, y) lies in the third quadrant because both x and y are negative.\n* **Distance from x-axis:**  Since the point is 6 units from the x-axis, its y-coordinate is -6 (because it's below the x-axis). \n* **Distance from (8, 3):**  We know the distance from (x, -6) to (8, 3) is 15 units.\n* **Distance from Origin:** We need to find the distance from (x, -6) to the origin (0, 0), which is represented by the square root of 'n'.\n**2. Use the Distance Formula:**\nThe distance formula helps us calculate the distance between two points: \n   \u221a[(x\u2082 - x\u2081)\u00b2 + (y\u2082 - y\u2081)\u00b2]\n* **Distance from (x, -6) to (8, 3):**\n   15 = \u221a[(8 - x)\u00b2 + (3 - (-6))\u00b2]\n   15 = \u221a[(8 - x)\u00b2 + 9\u00b2]\n   15\u00b2 = (8 - x)\u00b2 + 81\n   225 = (8 - x)\u00b2 + 81\n   144 = (8 - x)\u00b2\n* **Distance from (x, -6) to (0, 0):**\n   \u221an = \u221a[(0 - x)\u00b2 + (0 - (-6))\u00b2]\n   \u221an = \u221a[x\u00b2 + 36]\n**3.
