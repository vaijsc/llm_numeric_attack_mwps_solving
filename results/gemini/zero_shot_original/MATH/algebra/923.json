    "solution": "Note that since we can only use positive integers for $x$, the minimum will be x = 1.  Testing x = 2, we get $2^2 + 4\\cdot 2 + 4 = 16$.  Since $3^2 - 2^2 = 5$, we know that only $x = 1,2$ will work, thus, there are $\\boxed{2}$ positive integer values of $x$ such that this function is less than 20.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Factor the expression:**\nThe expression  $x^2 + 4x + 4$ is a perfect square trinomial.  It factors as:\n  $(x + 2)^2$\n**2. Set up the inequality:**\nWe want to find the values of *x* for which:\n  $(x + 2)^2 < 20$\n**3. Solve the inequality:**\n* **Take the square root of both sides:**  \n   \u221a((x + 2)\u00b2) < \u221a20 \n   |x + 2| < \u221a20 \n* **Simplify:**\n   |x + 2| < 2\u221a5\n* **Consider both positive and negative cases:**\n    * **Case 1:** x + 2 < 2\u221a5  \n       x < 2\u221a5 - 2 \n    * **Case 2:** -(x + 2) < 2\u221a5\n       -x - 2 < 2\u221a5\n       -x < 2\u221a5 + 2\n       x > -2\u221a5 - 2\n**4. Find the integer solutions:**\n* Since \u221a5 is a little more than 2,  2\u221a5 is a little more than 4. \n* Therefore,  2\u221a5 - 2 is a little more than 2, and -2\u221a5 - 2 is a little less than -6.\n* **Positive Solutions:**\n    * The positive integers less than 2\u221a5 - 2 are 1, 2, and 3.\n* **Negative Solutions:**\n    *  There are no positive integers greater than -2\u221a5 - 2.\n**5. Count the solutions:**\nThere are **3** positive integer values of *x* that satisfy the inequality. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Factor the quadratic:**\nThe expression  *x*\u00b2 + 4*x* + 4 is a perfect square trinomial, which factors as ( *x* + 2)\u00b2\n**2. Set up the inequality:**\nWe want to find the values of *x* for which ( *x* + 2)\u00b2 < 20\n**3. Solve the inequality:**\n* Take the square root of both sides:  *x* + 2 < \u221a20 \n* Simplify:  *x* + 2 < 2\u221a5\n* Subtract 2 from both sides: *x* < 2\u221a5 - 2\n**4. Find the integer solutions:**\nSince we're looking for positive integer values of *x*, let's approximate 2\u221a5 - 2:\n* \u221a5 is a little more than 2, so 2\u221a5 is a little more than 4.\n* 2\u221a5 - 2 is a little more than 2.\nTherefore, the positive integers that satisfy the inequality are:  *x* = 1, 2, 3\n**Answer:** There are **3** positive integer values of *x* that make the sum less than 20. \n",
