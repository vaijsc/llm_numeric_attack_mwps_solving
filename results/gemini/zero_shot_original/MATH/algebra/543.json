    "solution": "Since $1,\\,2,\\,3,\\ldots,250$ is an arithmetic sequence, the mean of all of the terms is equal to the mean of the first and last terms. (To see this, remember that the sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms.)  So the mean is $\\frac{1}{2}(1+250) = \\boxed{125.5}$.",

        "Here's how to find the mean (average) of the whole numbers from 1 to 250:\n**1.  Understand the Concept of Mean:**\n* The mean is the average of a set of numbers.\n* To find the mean, you add up all the numbers in the set and then divide by the total number of values.\n**2.  Apply the Concept to our Problem:**\n* We need to find the sum of all whole numbers from 1 to 250.  There's a handy formula for this:  \n   Sum of numbers from 1 to n = n(n+1)/2\n* In our case, n = 250. So the sum is: 250(250+1)/2 = 31,375\n* There are 250 numbers in the set (from 1 to 250).\n**3. Calculate the Mean:**\n* Mean = Sum of numbers / Total number of values\n* Mean = 31,375 / 250 = 125.5\n**Answer:** The mean of the whole numbers from 1 to 250 is **125.5**. \n",
        "Here's how to find the mean (average) of the whole numbers from 1 to 250:\n**1.  Sum of the Numbers:**\n* The sum of consecutive whole numbers from 1 to *n* is given by the formula:  n(n+1)/2\n* In our case, n = 250.  So, the sum of the numbers from 1 to 250 is (250 * 251) / 2 = 31,375\n**2. Calculate the Mean:**\n* Mean = (Sum of numbers) / (Number of numbers)\n* Mean = 31,375 / 250 = 125.5\n**Therefore, the mean of the whole numbers from 1 to 250 is 125.5** \n",

        "Here's how to find the mean of the whole numbers from 1 to 250:\n**1. Understand the Concept of Mean**\nThe mean (or average) is found by summing all the numbers in a set and then dividing by the total number of values.\n**2. Formula**\n* Mean = (Sum of all numbers) / (Total number of numbers)\n**3. Applying it to our Problem**\n* **Sum of all numbers:** The sum of the first 250 natural numbers can be found using the formula:  (n * (n + 1)) / 2  where 'n' is the last number. \n   So, the sum is (250 * (250 + 1)) / 2 = 31,375\n* **Total number of numbers:** There are 250 numbers from 1 to 250.\n**4.

Understand the Concept of Mean**\nThe mean (or average) is found by adding up all the numbers in a set and then dividing by the total number of items in the set.\n**2.  Arithmetic Series**\nThe numbers from 1 to 250 form an arithmetic series, where each number is one more than the previous one.  There's a shortcut for finding the sum of an arithmetic series:\n* **Sum = (first number + last number) * (number of terms / 2)**\n**3.  Calculate the Sum**\n* First number = 1\n* Last number = 250\n* Number of terms = 250\nSum = (1 + 250) * (250 / 2) = 251 * 125 = 31,375\n**4.
