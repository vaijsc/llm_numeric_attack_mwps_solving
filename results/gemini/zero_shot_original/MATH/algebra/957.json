    "solution": "We will consider two cases.\n\nCase 1: $x-3$ is nonnegative.  In this case, we have $|x-3| = x-3$.  Also, if $x-3$ is nonnegative, then $3-x$ (which is $-1$ times $x-3$) is nonpositive, which means that $|3-x| = -(3-x)$.  So, substituting for the absolute values in the original equation, we have  \\[x-3 - (3-x) -1 = 3.\\]Solving this equation gives $x = 5$.\n\nCase 2: $x-3$ is negative. In this case, we have $|x-3| = -(x-3)$.  Also, when $x-3$ is negative, then $3-x$ is positive, so $|3-x| = 3-x$.  So, substituting for the absolute values in the original equation, we have  \\[-(x-3) + 3-x - 1 = 3.\\]Solving this equation gives $x = 1$.\n\nCombining our cases, the sum of the values of $x$ that satisfy the equation is $\\boxed{6}$.\n\nNotice that we could have solved this equation even faster by noticing that $|3-x| = |(-1)(x-3)| = |(-1)||x-3| = |x-3|$, so the original equation simplifies to $2|x-3| - 1 = 3$, which gives us $|x-3| = 2$.  From here, we see that $x$ is 2 away from 3 on the number line, so $x$ is 5 or 1.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Simplify the equation:**\nNotice that  $|x-3|$ and $|3-x|$ are always equal because they represent the distance between $x$ and 3, regardless of which is larger.  Therefore:\n$|x-3| + |3-x| = 2|x-3|$\nOur equation becomes:\n$2|x-3| - 1 = 3$\n**2. Isolate the absolute value:**\nAdd 1 to both sides:\n$2|x-3| = 4$\nDivide both sides by 2:\n$|x-3| = 2$\n**3. Solve for x:**\nThe absolute value of an expression is its distance from zero.  Therefore, there are two possible solutions:\n* **Case 1:**  $x - 3 = 2$\n   Solving for *x*, we get  $x = 5$\n* **Case 2:**  $x - 3 = -2$\n   Solving for *x*, we get $x = 1$\n**4. Find the sum of the solutions:**\nThe sum of the values of *x* that satisfy the equation is 5 + 1 = **6**. \n",

Simplify the equation:**\n* Notice that  $|x-3|$ and $|3-x|$ are always equal since they represent the absolute value of the same quantity but with opposite signs. \n* Therefore, the equation becomes: \n   *  $|x-3| + |x-3| - 1 = 3$\n   *  2|x-3| - 1 = 3\n**2.
