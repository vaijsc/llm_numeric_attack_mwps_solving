        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Definitions**\n* **Arithmetic Mean:** The average of two numbers, found by adding them together and dividing by 2.  \n* **Geometric Mean:** The square root of the product of two numbers.\n**2. Set Up Equations**\nWe are given:\n* Arithmetic mean of  *x* and *y*:  (x + y) / 2 = 7\n* Geometric mean of *x* and *y*: \u221a(xy) = \u221a19\n**3. Solve for x and y**\n* From the arithmetic mean equation, we get: x + y = 14 \n* From the geometric mean equation, we get: xy = 19\nNow we have a system of two equations:\n  * x + y = 14\n  * xy = 19\nWe can solve this system by:\n* **Substitution:** Solve the first equation for x (x = 14 - y) and substitute it into the second equation.\n* **Squaring:** Square the first equation to get x\u00b2 + 2xy + y\u00b2 = 196.  Substitute the value of xy from the second equation and solve for x\u00b2 + y\u00b2.\n**4. Solve Using Substitution**\n* Substitute x = 14 - y into xy = 19:\n   (14 - y) * y = 19\n* Expand: 14y - y\u00b2 = 19\n* Rearrange: y\u00b2 - 14y + 19 = 0\n* This quadratic equation doesn't factor easily, so we can use the quadratic formula to find the values of y:\n   y = (14 \u00b1 \u221a(14\u00b2 - 4 * 1 * 19)) / (2 * 1)\n   y = (14 \u00b1 \u221a120) / 2\n   y = 7 \u00b1 \u221a30\n* Substitute each value of y back into the equation x + y = 14 to find the corresponding values of x. You'll get two possible solutions for (x, y).\n**5. Calculate x\u00b2 + y\u00b2**\nCalculate x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 for each of the two possible solutions for (x, y) that you found.\n**Important Note:** Since we are squaring *x* and *y*, the order of the solutions doesn't matter, and you'll get the same answer for x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 in both cases. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Definitions:**\n* **Arithmetic Mean:** The arithmetic mean of two numbers is their sum divided by 2.  \n* **Geometric Mean:** The geometric mean of two numbers is the square root of their product.\n**2. Set Up Equations:**\n* We are given that the arithmetic mean of *x* and *y* is 7:  \n   (x + y)/2 = 7\n* We are also given that the geometric mean of *x* and *y* is \u221a19:\n   \u221a(xy) = \u221a19\n**3. Solve for x and y:**\n* From the arithmetic mean equation, we get: x + y = 14\n* Square both sides of the geometric mean equation: xy = 19\n**4. Use a Helpful Identity:**\nWe can use the identity: (x + y)\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + 2xy + y\u00b2 \n* Substitute the values we found: (14)\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + 2(19) + y\u00b2\n* Simplify: 196 = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 38\n**5. Find x\u00b2 + y\u00b2:**\n* Subtract 38 from both sides:  196 - 38 = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2\n* Therefore, x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = **158** \n",
