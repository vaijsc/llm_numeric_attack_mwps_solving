        "Here's how to evaluate the expression step-by-step:\n* **Understanding the notation:** The symbol $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ represents the **floor function**. This function takes a real number *x* and rounds it *down* to the nearest integer.\n* **Calculate the division:**  36 divided by 7 is approximately 5.14.\n* **Round down:** Since 5.14 is between 5 and 6, rounding down to the nearest integer gives us 5.\n**Therefore,  $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{36}{7}\\right\\rfloor = 5$.** \n",
        "The notation $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ represents the **floor function**, which gives the greatest integer less than or equal to *x*.\n1. **Divide:**  36 divided by 7 is approximately 5.14.\n2. **Find the greatest integer less than or equal to 5.14:**  This is **5**.\nTherefore, $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{36}{7}\\right\\rfloor = \\boxed{5}$. \n",
