    "solution": "We focus on the portion of the floor that is left unpainted. After one day, $\\frac12$ of the floor is left unpainted. After two days, $\\frac1{2^2}$ of the floor is left unpainted, and so on. After $n$ days, $\\frac1{2^n}$ of the floor is unpainted. The floor has area $15^2 = 225$ square feet, so we look for the least number of days $n$ when at most $\\frac1{225}$ of the floor is left unpainted: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac1{2^n} &\\leq \\frac1{225}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow 2^n &\\geq 225\\\\\n\\Rightarrow n&\\geq8.\n\\end{align*} Thus, Zeno took $\\boxed{8}$ days to paint the floor.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n* **Day 1:** Zeno paints half the floor, leaving 1/2 * (15 * 15) = 112.5 square feet unpainted.\n* **Day 2:** Zeno paints half of the remaining area, leaving 1/2 * 112.5 = 56.25 square feet unpainted.\n* **Day 3:** Zeno paints half of the remaining area, leaving 1/2 * 56.25 = 28.125 square feet unpainted.\n* **Day 4:** Zeno paints half of the remaining area, leaving 1/2 * 28.125 = 14.0625 square feet unpainted.\n* **Day 5:** Zeno paints half of the remaining area, leaving 1/2 * 14.0625 = 7.03125 square feet unpainted.\n* **Day 6:** Zeno paints half of the remaining area, leaving 1/2 * 7.03125 = 3.515625 square feet unpainted.\n* **Day 7:** Zeno paints half of the remaining area, leaving 1/2 * 3.515625 = 1.7578125 square feet unpainted.\n* **Day 8:** Zeno paints the remaining area, which is less than 1 square foot.\n**Therefore, it took Zeno 8 days to paint the entire floor.** \n",
        "Here's how to break down the problem:\n* **Day 1:** Zeno paints half of the floor, leaving 1/2 * 225 square feet = 112.5 square feet unpainted.\n* **Day 2:** Zeno paints half of the remaining area, leaving 1/2 * 112.5 square feet = 56.25 square feet unpainted.\n* **Day 3:** Zeno paints half of the remaining area, leaving 1/2 * 56.25 square feet = 28.125 square feet unpainted.\n* **Day 4:** Zeno paints half of the remaining area, leaving 1/2 * 28.125 square feet = 14.0625 square feet unpainted.\n* **Day 5:** Zeno paints half of the remaining area, leaving 1/2 * 14.0625 square feet = 7.03125 square feet unpainted.\n* **Day 6:** Zeno paints half of the remaining area, leaving 1/2 * 7.03125 square feet = 3.515625 square feet unpainted.\n* **Day 7:** Zeno paints half of the remaining area, leaving 1/2 * 3.515625 square feet = 1.7578125 square feet unpainted.\n* **Day 8:** Zeno paints half of the remaining area, leaving 1/2 * 1.7578125 square feet = 0.87890625 square feet unpainted. \n* **Day 9:** Zeno finishes the remaining area, since it's less than 1 square foot.\n**Therefore, it took Zeno 9 days to paint the entire floor.** \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem:\n**1. Calculate the initial area:**\n* The floor is a square with sides of 15 feet, so its area is 15 feet * 15 feet = 225 square feet.\n**2. Figure out how much area is painted each day:**\n* Zeno paints half the unpainted area each day. \n**3. Track the area painted over several days:**\n* **Day 1:** Paints 225 / 2 = 112.5 square feet \n* **Day 2:** Paints 112.5 / 2 = 56.25 square feet\n* **Day 3:** Paints 56.25 / 2 = 28.125 square feet\n* **Day 4:** Paints 28.125 / 2 = 14.0625 square feet\n* **Day 5:** Paints 14.0625 / 2 = 7.03125 square feet\n* **Day 6:** Paints 7.03125 / 2 = 3.515625 square feet\n* **Day 7:** Paints 3.515625 / 2 = 1.7578125 square feet (still more than 1 square foot)\n* **Day 8:** Paints 1.7578125 / 2 = 0.87890625 square feet (less than 1 square foot)\n**4. Final day:**\n* On the 8th day, Zeno has less than 1 square foot left, so he finishes the remaining area.\n**Answer:** It took Zeno **8 days** to paint the entire floor. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding the Pattern:**\n* **Day 1:** Zeno paints half the floor, leaving 1/2 * 225 sq ft = 112.5 sq ft unpainted.\n* **Day 2:** He paints half of the remaining area, leaving 1/2 * 112.5 sq ft = 56.25 sq ft unpainted.\n* **Day 3:** He paints half of the remaining area, leaving 1/2 * 56.25 sq ft = 28.125 sq ft unpainted.\nYou can see a pattern here: each day, the amount of unpainted area is halved.\n**Finding the Number of Days:**\nTo figure out how many days it takes, we need to find the highest power of 2 that is less than 225 (the total area).\n* 2^7 = 128\n* 2^8 = 256\nSince 225 is between 128 and 256, it means after 7 days, Zeno will have painted more than 128 square feet.  On the 8th day, he'll paint half of the remaining area, leaving less than one square foot.  \n**Answer:** It will take Zeno **8 days** to paint the entire floor. \n",
