    "solution": "Moving terms to the LHS, we have $x^2-6x+y^2+8y=24$. Completing the square on the quadratic in $x$, we add $(6/2)^2=9$ to both sides. Completing the square on the quadratic in $y$, we add $(8/2)^2=16$ to both sides. We are left with the equation $x^2-6x+9+y^2+8y+16=49 \\Rightarrow (x-3)^2+(y+4)^2=49$. Thus, our circle has center $(3,-4)$. The distance between this center and the point $(-3,-12)$ is $\\sqrt{(-3-3)^2+(-12-(-4))^2}=\\boxed{10}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Rewrite the equation in standard form:**\nThe standard form of a circle's equation is $(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$, where $(h,k)$ is the center and $r$ is the radius.  \nTo get our equation into standard form, complete the square:\n* **Start with the given equation:**  $x^2 + y^2 = 6x - 8y + 24$\n* **Move the x and y terms to the left side:**  $x^2 - 6x + y^2 + 8y = 24$\n* **Complete the square for x:** Take half of the coefficient of our x term (-6), square it (9), and add it to both sides.  \n* **Complete the square for y:** Take half of the coefficient of our y term (8), square it (16), and add it to both sides.\nThis gives us: \n  \n  $x^2 - 6x + 9 + y^2 + 8y + 16 = 24 + 9 + 16$\n* **Rewrite in standard form:** $(x-3)^2 + (y+4)^2 = 49$\n**2. Identify the center of the circle:**\nFrom the standard form, we see that the center of the circle is $(h,k) = (3,-4)$.\n**3.

        "### Response:\n1. **Rewrite the equation in standard form:**  To find the center and radius of the circle, we need to rewrite the equation in the form $(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$, where $(h,k)$ is the center and $r$ is the radius.\n   We do this by completing the square:\n   * **Group the x and y terms:** \n     (x\u00b2 - 6x) + (y\u00b2 + 8y) = 24\n   * **Complete the square for x:** Take half of the coefficient of the x term (-6), square it (9), and add it to both sides of the equation: \n     (x\u00b2 - 6x + 9) + (y\u00b2 + 8y) = 24 + 9\n   * **Complete the square for y:** Take half of the coefficient of the y term (8), square it (16), and add it to both sides of the equation:\n     (x\u00b2 - 6x + 9) + (y\u00b2 + 8y + 16) = 24 + 9 + 16\n   * **Rewrite in standard form:**\n     (x - 3)\u00b2 + (y + 4)\u00b2 = 49 \n2. **Identify the center and radius:**  Now we can see that the center of the circle is (3, -4) and the radius is \u221a49 = 7.\n3. **Use the distance formula:** The distance between the center (3, -4) and the point (-3, -12) is found using the distance formula:\n   \u221a[(3 - (-3))\u00b2 + (-4 - (-12))\u00b2] = \u221a[(6)\u00b2 + (8)\u00b2] = \u221a(36 + 64) = \u221a100 = 10\n**Therefore, the distance between the center of the circle and the point (-3, -12) is 10 units.** \n",
        "1. **Rewrite the equation in standard form:** To find the center of the circle, we need to rewrite the equation in standard form, which is $(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$, where $(h,k)$ is the center and $r$ is the radius.\n   Start by completing the square for both the $x$ and $y$ terms:\n   * **For x:**  \n     - Move the $x$ term to the left side: $x^2 - 6x + y^2 + 8y = 24$\n     - Take half of the coefficient of the $x$ term (-6), square it (9), and add it to both sides: $x^2 - 6x + 9 + y^2 + 8y = 24 + 9$\n     - Factor the perfect square trinomial: $(x-3)^2 + y^2 + 8y = 33$\n   * **For y:**\n     - Take half of the coefficient of the $y$ term (8), square it (16), and add it to both sides: $(x-3)^2 + y^2 + 8y + 16 = 33 + 16$\n     - Factor the perfect square trinomial: $(x-3)^2 + (y+4)^2 = 49$\n2. **Identify the center:** Now the equation is in standard form.
