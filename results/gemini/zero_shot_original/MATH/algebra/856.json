    "solution": "We have: $$0.1\\overline{7} = \\frac{1}{10}+\\frac{7}{10^2}+\\frac{7}{10^3}+\\frac{7}{10^4}+\\cdots.$$After the first term, the series on the right is an infinite geometric series with first term $7/10^2$ and common ratio $1/10$. So we have: $$0.1\\overline{7} = \\frac{1}{10}+\\frac{\\frac{7}{10^2}}{1-\\frac{1}{10}} = \\frac{1}{10}+\\frac{\\frac{7}{10^2}}{\\frac{9}{10}}=\\frac{1}{10}+\\frac{7}{90}=\\frac{9+7}{90} = \\frac{16}{90}=\\boxed{\\frac{8}{45}}.$$",

        "Here's how to express  $0.1\\overline{7}$ as a common fraction:\n**1. Set up an equation:**\nLet  *x* equal the decimal: \n   *x* = 0.17777...\n**2. Multiply to shift the repeating block:**\nMultiply both sides of the equation by 10 to shift the decimal one place to the right:\n  10*x* = 1.7777...\n**3. Multiply to isolate the repeating block:**\nMultiply both sides of the equation by 100 to shift the decimal two places to the right:\n  100*x* = 17.7777...\n**4. Subtract the equations:**\nSubtract the equation from step 2 from the equation in step 3:\n```\n100x = 17.7777...\n - 10x =  1.7777...\n------------------\n 90x = 16 \n```\n**5. Solve for x:**\nDivide both sides by 90:\n  *x* = 16/90\n**6. Simplify:**\nReduce the fraction to its simplest form:\n  *x* = **8/45**\nTherefore, 0.17777... (or 0.17) is equivalent to **8/45**. \n",
        "Here's how to express  0.1777... as a common fraction:\n**1. Set up an equation:**\nLet  *x* equal the decimal: \n   *x* = 0.1777...\n**2. Multiply to shift the repeating block:**\nMultiply both sides of the equation by 10:\n   10*x* = 1.7777...\n**3. Subtract the original equation:**\nSubtract the first equation from the second equation:\n   10*x* = 1.7777...\n   - *x* = 0.1777...\n   ----------------\n    9*x* = 1.6\n**4. Solve for *x*:**\nDivide both sides by 9:\n   *x* = 1.6 / 9 = 16/90\n**5. Simplify:**\nSimplify the fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 2:\n   *x* = **8/45**\nTherefore, 0.1777... is equivalent to the fraction **8/45**. \n",
