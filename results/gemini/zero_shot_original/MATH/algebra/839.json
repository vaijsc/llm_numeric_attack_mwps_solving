    "solution": "Call the number of red marbles $a$, the number of yellow marbles $b$, the number of orange marbles $c$, and the number of white marbles $d$. We can express the information given in the problem by the following system of linear equations:  \\begin{align*}\na+b+c+d &= 35\\\\\n\\frac{a}{2} = b - 2 = \\frac{c}{3} &= \\frac{d+3}{3}\n\\end{align*} Using the second expression, we can solve for $a$, $c$, and $d$ in terms of $b$:\n\\begin{align*}\na &= 2b - 4,\\\\\nc &= 3b - 6, \\\\\nd &= 3b - 9\n\\end{align*} Putting these values into the first equation gives $2b - 4 + b + 3b - 6 + 3b - 9 = 35$, so $b = 6$. Because $a = 2b - 4$, $a = 12 - 4 = \\boxed{8}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**Let's use variables:**\n*  Let 'r' represent the number of red marbles.\n*  Let 'y' represent the number of yellow marbles.\n*  Let 'o' represent the number of orange marbles.\n*  Let 'w' represent the number of white marbles.\n**Translate the word problem into equations:**\n* **\"Half the number of red marbles equals two less than the number of yellow marbles\":**  (r/2) = (y - 2)\n* **\"Half the number of red marbles equals a third the number of orange marbles\":** (r/2) = (o/3)\n* **\"Half the number of red marbles equals a third of three more than the number of white marbles\":** (r/2) = (1/3)(w + 3)\n**Solve the system of equations:**\n1. **Focus on the first two equations:**  Since both equations are set equal to (r/2), we can set the right sides equal to each other: \n   (y - 2) = (o/3)\n2. **Focus on the first and third equations:**  Again, since both are set equal to (r/2), we can set the right sides equal to each other: \n   (y - 2) = (1/3)(w + 3)\n3. **We now have two new equations:**\n   * (y - 2) = (o/3)\n   * (y - 2) = (1/3)(w + 3)\n4. **Simplify the second new equation:**\n   * (y - 2) = (w/3) + 1\n5. **Solve for 'y' in terms of 'w':**\n   * y = (w/3) + 3\n6. **Substitute this expression for 'y' into the first new equation:**\n   * ((w/3) + 3 - 2) = (o/3)\n   * (w/3) + 1 = (o/3)\n7. **Solve for 'o' in terms of 'w':**\n   * o = w + 3\n8. **Now we have expressions for 'y' and 'o' in terms of 'w'.  We can use any of the original equations to solve for 'r' and 'w'.  Let's use the first original equation:**\n   * (r/2) = (y - 2)\n   * Substitute our expression for 'y': (r/2) = ((w/3) + 3 - 2)\n   * Simplify: (r/2) = (w/3) + 1\n9. **We also know that the total number of marbles is 35:**\n   * r + y + o + w = 35\n10. **Substitute our expressions for 'y' and 'o' into this equation:**\n   * r + ((w/3) + 3) + (w + 3) + w = 35\n11. **Solve for 'w':**\n   * r + (7/3)w + 6 = 35\n   * (7/3)w = 29 - r\n12. **Now we have an equation relating 'r' and 'w'.  We can use the equation (r/2) = (w/3) + 1 to solve for 'w' in terms of 'r':**\n   * w = (3/2)r - 3\n13. **Substitute this expression for 'w' into the equation (7/3)w = 29 - r:**\n   * (7/3) * ((3/2)r - 3) = 29 - r\n   * (7/2)r - 7 = 29 - r\n14. **Solve for 'r':**\n   * (9/2)r = 36\n   * r = 8\n**Therefore, there are 8 red marbles.** \n",

We need to find a way to relate Y and W.**  We can use the equation 2Y - 4 = (2/3)W + 2, which we derived earlier. Solving for W, we get:\n    * W = (3/2)(2Y - 6) = 3Y - 9\n11. **Substitute this value of W into our equation 6Y + W = 45:**\n    * 6Y + (3Y - 9) = 45\n    * 9Y = 54\n    * Y = 6 \n12. **Now that we know Y = 6, we can find R using the equation R = 2Y - 4:**\n    * R = 2(6) - 4\n    * R = 8\n**Therefore, there are 8 red marbles in the bag.** \n",
