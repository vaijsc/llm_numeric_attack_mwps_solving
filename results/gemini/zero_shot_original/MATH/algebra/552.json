        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n* **Going to the park:** You run at a speed of  *x\u00b2* miles per hour for 3 hours.\n* **Returning home:** You jog at a speed of *(16 - 4x)* miles per hour for 4 hours.\n* **Key point:** The distance to the park and back is the same.\n**2. Set up the Equations**\n* **Distance to the park:** (speed) * (time) =  *x\u00b2* * 3 = 3*x\u00b2* miles\n* **Distance back home:** (speed) * (time) = *(16 - 4x)* * 4 = 64 - 16x miles\n**3. Equate the Distances**\nSince the distance to the park and back is the same, we can set the two distance equations equal to each other:\n \n 3*x\u00b2 = 64 - 16x\n**4. Solve the Quadratic Equation**\n* Rearrange the equation to get a quadratic equation: 3*x\u00b2 + 16x - 64 = 0\n* Factor the quadratic equation: (3x - 8)(x + 8) = 0\n* Solve for *x*:\n    * 3x - 8 = 0  =>  x = 8/3\n    * x + 8 = 0  =>  x = -8\n**5. Choose the Valid Solution**\nSince the problem states that *x > 0*, the valid solution is **x = 8/3**. \n**Answer:**  x = **8/3** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Problem:**\n* **Distance:** The distance to the park and back is the same.\n* **Speed:**  You run at a faster speed going to the park ($x^2$ mph) and a slower speed coming back (16 - 4x mph).\n* **Time:** You spend 3 hours going to the park and 4 hours coming back.\n**2. Set Up Equations:**\n* **Distance to the park:**  (speed) * (time) =  $x^2$ mph * 3 hours = $3x^2$ miles\n* **Distance back home:** (speed) * (time) = (16 - 4x) mph * 4 hours = 64 - 16x miles\n**3.

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Set up equations for distance:**\n* **Outbound trip:** Distance = Speed x Time.  The distance to the park is  (x^2 miles/hour) * (3 hours) = 3x^2 miles.\n* **Return trip:**  The distance back home is also 3x^2 miles.  This is equal to (16 - 4x miles/hour) * (4 hours) = 64 - 16x miles.\n**2. Equate the distances:**\nSince the distance to the park and back is the same, we can set the two expressions equal: \n3x^2 = 64 - 16x\n**3.
