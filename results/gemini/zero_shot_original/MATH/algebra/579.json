    "problem": "Hillary has eleven coins, all dimes and nickels. In total, the coins are worth 75 cents. How many nickels does she have?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let the number of dimes Hillary has be $d$ and the number of nickels she has be $n$. We have the two equations \\begin{align*}\nd+n&=11\\\\\n10d+5n&=75\n\\end{align*} (The last equation is in terms of cents.) To make the second equation nicer, we divide both sides by 5 to get $2d+n=15$. From the first given equation, we have $d=11-n$. Substituting this into the simplified second given equation to eliminate $d$, we get $2(11-n)+n=15\\Rightarrow n=7$. Thus, Hillary has $\\boxed{7}$ nickels.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Set up variables:**\n* Let 'd' represent the number of dimes.\n* Let 'n' represent the number of nickels.\n**2. Create equations based on the given information:**\n* **Equation 1 (Total number of coins):** d + n = 11 \n* **Equation 2 (Total value of coins):** 10d + 5n = 75 (Since a dime is worth 10 cents and a nickel is worth 5 cents)\n**3. Solve for one variable in terms of the other:**\n* From Equation 1, we can solve for 'd':  d = 11 - n\n**4. Substitute the value of 'd' into Equation 2:**\n* 10(11 - n) + 5n = 75\n**5. Simplify and solve for 'n':**\n* 110 - 10n + 5n = 75\n* -5n = -35\n* n = 7\n**Therefore, Hillary has 7 nickels.** \n",
