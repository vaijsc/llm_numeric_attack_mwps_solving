        "Here's how to determine which value is the least:\n* **Simplify:**\n    *  B = \u221a[4]{4} = 4^(1/4) = 2^(1/2) = \u221a2\n    *  C = \u221a[8]{8} = 8^(1/8) = 2^(3/8)\n* **Compare:**\n    *  A = \u221a2 = 2^(1/2)\n    *  B = \u221a2 = 2^(1/2)\n    *  C = 2^(3/8)\nSince the base is the same (2) in all cases, the value depends on the exponent.  The smaller the exponent, the smaller the value.\n* 3/8 is the largest exponent.\n* 1/2 is the smallest exponent.\n**Therefore, C has the least value.** \n",

        "Here's how to break down the problem:\n* **Understanding Roots:**  The notation $\\sqrt[n]{x}$ represents the *nth root* of *x*.
