    "problem": "For a certain species of ocean fish, 8 fish can exist per cubic meter of water without the symptoms of overcrowding. If doctors want to study 600 fish, what is the minimum number of cubic meters of water necessary to maintain a healthy study environment?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We need 8 fish per cubic meter.  We have 600 fish, so we have $600/8 = 75$ groups of 8 fish, which means we need $\\boxed{75}$ cubic meters of water.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n1. **Find the cubic meters needed per fish:**  Since 8 fish can live comfortably in 1 cubic meter, each fish needs 1/8 of a cubic meter. \n2. **Calculate the total cubic meters needed:**  Multiply the cubic meters per fish by the number of fish: (1/8 cubic meter/fish) * (600 fish) = 75 cubic meters.\n**Answer:** The minimum number of cubic meters of water needed to maintain a healthy study environment for 600 fish is 75 cubic meters. \n",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n* **Understand the relationship:** We know that 8 fish can live comfortably in 1 cubic meter of water.\n* **Divide the desired population by the capacity per cubic meter:** To find the total cubic meters needed, divide the desired population (600 fish) by the number of fish per cubic meter (8 fish): 600 fish / 8 fish/cubic meter = 75 cubic meters.\n**Answer:** The minimum number of cubic meters of water necessary to maintain a healthy study environment for 600 fish is 75 cubic meters. \n",
