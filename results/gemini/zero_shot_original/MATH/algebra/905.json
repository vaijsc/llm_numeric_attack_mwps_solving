    "solution": "Let the first term be $a$ and the common difference be $d$.  The sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms.  The fifth term is $a + 4d$, so the sum of the first five terms is \\[\\frac{a + (a + 4d)}{2} \\cdot 5 = 5a + 10d = 70,\\]which implies that $a + 2d = 14$, so $2d = 14 - a$.\n\nThe tenth term is $a + 9d$, so the sum of the first ten terms is \\[\\frac{a + (a + 9d)}{2} \\cdot 10 = 10a + 45d = 210,\\]which implies that $2a + 9d = 42$, so $9d = 42 - 2a$.\n\nFrom the equation $2d = 14 - a$, $18d = 126 - 9a$, and from the equation $9d = 42 - 2a$, $18d = 84 - 4a$, so \\[126 - 9a = 84 - 4a.\\]Then $5a = 42$, so $a = \\boxed{\\frac{42}{5}}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Understanding Arithmetic Series**\n* An arithmetic series is a sequence of numbers where the difference between any two consecutive terms is constant. This constant difference is called the common difference, often denoted by 'd'.\n* The sum of an arithmetic series is found using the formula:  S = (n/2) * [2a + (n-1)d] \n    * Where: \n        * S = sum of the series\n        * n = number of terms\n        * a = first term\n        * d = common difference\n**2. Setting Up Equations**\nWe are given two pieces of information:\n* **Information 1:** The sum of the first 5 terms is 70.  This translates to: \n    * 70 = (5/2) * [2a + (5-1)d] \n    * Simplifying: 70 = 5a + 10d\n* **Information 2:** The sum of the first 10 terms is 210.

Let's use Equation 1:\n        * 70 = 5a + 10(14/5)\n        * 70 = 5a + 28\n        * 42 = 5a\n        * a = 42/5 = 8.4\n* **Method 2: Substitution**\n    * Solve Equation 1 for 'a': a = 14 - 2d\n    * Substitute this expression for 'a' into Equation 2:\n        * 210 = 10(14 - 2d) + 45d\n        * 210 = 140 - 20d + 45d\n        * 70 = 25d\n        * d = 70/25 = 14/5\n    * Substitute the value of 'd' back into the expression for 'a':\n        * a = 14 - 2(14/5) = 42/5 = 8.4\n**4.
