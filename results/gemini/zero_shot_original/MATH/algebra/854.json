    "solution": "Let $x$ be the cost per square inch of gold paint, and let $y$ be the cost per cubic inch of concrete.  Since a 1 inch cube has surface area 6 $\\text{in}^2$ and volume 1 $\\text{in}^3$ its total price will be $6x+y$ dollars.  Similarly, a 2 inch cube has surface area 24 $\\text{in}^2$ and volume 8 $\\text{in}^3$, so its total price will be $24x+8y$ dollars.  We are given that \\begin{align*} 6x+y &=\\$1.30 \\\\ 24x+8y&= \\$6.80 \\end{align*} Subtracting 4 times the first equation from the second gives $4y=\\$1.60$, so $y=\\$0.40$.  Hence $6x=\\$0.90$, so $x=\\$0.15$.  Since a 3 inch cube has surface area 54 $\\text{in}^2$ and volume 27 $\\text{in}^3$, its total price will be a total of $54(\\$0.15)+27(\\$0.40)=\\boxed{\\$18.90}$.",

Set up the equations:**\n* Let  'x' represent the cost of the paint per square inch.\n* Let 'y' represent the cost of the concrete per cubic inch.\nWe know:\n* **1-inch cube:**  6x + y = $1.30 (surface area is 6 square inches, volume is 1 cubic inch)\n* **2-inch cube:** 24x + 8y = $6.80 (surface area is 24 square inches, volume is 8 cubic inch)\n**2. Solve for x and y:**\nWe can use a system of equations to solve for x and y.  Here's one way:\n* **Multiply the first equation by -8:** \n   -48x - 8y = -$10.40 \n* **Add this equation to the second equation:**\n   -24x = -$3.60\n* **Solve for x:**\n   x = $0.15 \n* **Substitute the value of x back into the first equation:**\n   6(0.15) + y = $1.30\n   0.90 + y = $1.30\n* **Solve for y:**\n   y = $0.40\n**3.

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Costs**\n* **Concrete Cost:**  The cost of the concrete is proportional to the volume of the cube.  This means the cost increases as the cube gets bigger (because there's more concrete).\n* **Paint Cost:** The cost of the paint is proportional to the surface area of the cube. This means the cost increases as the cube gets bigger (because there's more surface to cover).\n**2. Set up Equations**\nLet's use variables:\n*  `V` = cost per cubic inch of concrete\n*  `S` = cost per square inch of paint\n*  `x` = side length of the cube\nThe cost of a cube can be expressed as:\n* **Cost = (Volume of cube) * V + (Surface area of cube) * S**\nFor a 1-inch cube:\n* Cost = $1.30\n* Volume = 1 cubic inch\n* Surface area = 6 square inches\nFor a 2-inch cube:\n* Cost = $6.80\n* Volume = 8 cubic inches\n* Surface area = 24 square inches\nNow we can plug these values into our cost equation to get two equations:\n* Equation 1:  1.30 = 1 * V + 6 * S \n* Equation 2: 6.80 = 8 * V + 24 * S\n**3. Solve for V and S**\nWe have two equations and two unknowns, so we can solve for `V` and `S`.  There are a few ways to do this:\n* **Substitution:** Solve one equation for one variable, then substitute it into the other equation. \n* **Elimination:** Multiply one or both equations by constants to make the coefficients of one variable the same, then add or subtract the equations to eliminate that variable.\nLet's use elimination:\n* Multiply Equation 1 by -8:  -10.40 = -8 * V - 48 * S\n* Add this to Equation 2: -3.60 = -36 * S\n* Solve for S: S = 0.10\nNow substitute the value of S back into either Equation 1 or Equation 2 to find V:\n* Using Equation 1: 1.30 = 1 * V + 6 * 0.10\n* Solve for V: V = 0.70\n**4. Calculate the Cost of a 3-inch Cube**\n* Volume of a 3-inch cube = 3 * 3 * 3 = 27 cubic inches\n* Surface area of a 3-inch cube = 6 * 3 * 3 = 54 square inches\nCost of a 3-inch cube = (27 cubic inches * 0.70) + (54 square inches * 0.10) = 18.90 + 5.40 = $24.30\n**Answer:** A 3-inch cube would cost $24.30 to make. \n",
