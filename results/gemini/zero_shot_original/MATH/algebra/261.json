        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Set up variables:**\n* Let  'x' represent the weight of B.\n* A's weight is 40% greater than B, so A weighs 1.4x.\n* A's weight is 30% less than C, so A weighs 0.7C.\n**2. Create an equation:**\nSince A's weight is expressed in terms of both B and C, we can set the two expressions equal:\n1.4x = 0.7C\n**3. Solve for the ratio of B to C:**\n* Divide both sides of the equation by 0.7:\n   2x = C\n* Divide both sides by C:\n   2x/C = 1\n* Divide both sides by 2:\n   x/C = 1/2\n**4. Express as a common fraction:**\nThe ratio of B's weight (x) to C's weight (C) is **1/2**. \n",
        "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n**1. Set up variables:**\n* Let  'B' represent the weight of object B.\n* Let 'C' represent the weight of object C.\n**2. Translate the given information into equations:**\n* \"The weight of A is 40% greater than the weight of B\": This means A = B + 0.4B = 1.4B\n* \"The weight of A is 30% less than the weight of C\": This means A = C - 0.3C = 0.7C\n**3.  Combine the equations to find the ratio of B to C:**\n* Since we have two expressions for A, we can set them equal to each other:  1.4B = 0.7C \n* To find the ratio of B to C, divide both sides of the equation by 0.7C: \n   * (1.4B) / (0.7C) = (0.7C) / (0.7C)\n   * This simplifies to 2B/C = 1\n**4. Express the ratio as a fraction:**\n*  To get the ratio of B to C, we want C in the denominator. Divide both sides by 2:\n   * (2B/C) / 2 = 1/2\n   *  This gives us B/C = 1/2\n**Answer:** The ratio of the weight of B to the weight of C is **1/2**. \n",
