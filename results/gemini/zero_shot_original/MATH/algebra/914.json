Shifting this last parabola 5 units down changes its equation to $y=-x^2-4$. Rotating it by 180 degrees changes its equation to $y=x^2-4$. So the equation of $A'$ is $y=x^2-4$. To find the zeros of this parabola, we set $y=0$ to get $0=x^2-4$. Factoring the right hand side, we get $0=(x-2)(x+2)$, so either $x-2=0\\Rightarrow x=2$ or $x+2=0 \\Rightarrow x=-2$. Thus, $a=-2$ and $b=2$, so $b-a=\\boxed{4}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Original Parabola**\n* The equation  $y = -(x + 1)^2 + 1$ represents a parabola that opens downwards, with vertex at (-1, 1).\n**2. Shift 1 Unit to the Right**\n*  Shifting 1 unit to the right means replacing  *x* with *(x - 1)* in the equation: \n   *  $y = -(x - 1 + 1)^2 + 1$ \n   *  $y = -x^2 + 1$\n**3. Shift 5 Units Down**\n*  Shifting 5 units down means subtracting 5 from the entire equation:\n   *  $y = -x^2 + 1 - 5$\n   *  $y = -x^2 - 4$\n**4. Rotation 180 Degrees**\n*  Rotating 180 degrees about the vertex doesn't change the shape of the parabola. It simply flips it over the vertex. This is equivalent to multiplying the entire equation by -1:\n   *  $y = x^2 + 4$\n**5. Finding the Zeros**\n* The zeros of the parabola are the x-values where y = 0.  Let's solve for x:\n   *  $0 = x^2 + 4$\n   *  $x^2 = -4$\n   *  This equation has no real solutions. This means the parabola does not intersect the x-axis, and therefore has no zeros.\n**Conclusion**\nThe resulting parabola has no zeros, so *a* and *b* are undefined. Therefore, *b - a* is also undefined. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Shifting 1 unit to the right**\nShifting a graph 1 unit to the right replaces $x$ with $(x-1)$ in the equation.  So the new equation is: \n  \n  *  $y = -(x-1+1)^2 + 1 = -x^2 + 1$\n**2. Shifting 5 units down**\nShifting a graph 5 units down subtracts 5 from the equation.  The new equation is:\n  *  $y = -x^2 + 1 - 5 = -x^2 - 4$\n**3. Rotating 180 degrees about the vertex**\nThe vertex of the parabola is at $(0,-4)$. Rotating 180 degrees about this point simply reflects the parabola across the vertex. This leaves the equation unchanged:\n  *  $y = -x^2 - 4$\n**4. Finding the zeros**\nThe zeros of the parabola are the x-values where the graph crosses the x-axis, meaning where  $y = 0$.  Let's solve for $x$:\n  *  $0 = -x^2 - 4$\n  *  $x^2 = -4$ \n  *  $x = \\pm 2i$\nSince the zeros are imaginary, we can't find the difference between them. This means the final parabola doesn't intersect the x-axis.\n**Therefore, the final parabola has no real zeros, and the problem has no solution.** \n",
        "Here's a step-by-step solution to find the difference between the zeros of the transformed parabola:\n**1. Original Parabola:**\n* The equation  *y = -(x + 1)\u00b2 + 1* represents a parabola opening downwards with vertex at (-1, 1).\n**2. Shifting 1 Unit Right:**\n* Shifting 1 unit right means replacing *x* with *(x - 1)* in the equation: \n   *  *y = -((x - 1) + 1)\u00b2 + 1*\n   *  *y = -(x)\u00b2 + 1* \n**3. Shifting 5 Units Down:**\n* Shifting 5 units down means subtracting 5 from the entire equation:\n   * *y = -(x)\u00b2 + 1 - 5*\n   * *y = -(x)\u00b2 - 4*\n**4. Rotating 180 Degrees:**\n* Rotating a parabola 180 degrees about its vertex doesn't change the shape of the parabola, but it flips it across the x-axis. This means the coefficient of the *x\u00b2* term will change sign.\n   * *y = (x)\u00b2 - 4*\n**5. Finding the Zeros:**\n* To find the zeros, we set *y = 0* and solve for *x*:\n   * *0 = (x)\u00b2 - 4*\n   * *4 = (x)\u00b2*\n   * *x = \u00b12* \n**6. Determining *a* and *b***\n* Since *b \u2265 a*, we have *a = -2* and *b = 2*.\n**7. Calculating *b - a***\n* *b - a = 2 - (-2) = 4*\n**Therefore, *b - a = 4*** \n",
