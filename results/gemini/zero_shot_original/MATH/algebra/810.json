        "Here's how to find the radius of the circle:\n**1. Complete the Square**\nTo find the radius, we need to rewrite the equation in standard circle form:  (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\n* **For x-terms:**  Take half of the coefficient of the x-term (-4), square it (4), and add it to both sides of the equation:\n   x\u00b2 - 4x + 4 + y\u00b2 - 6y - 36 = 0 + 4 \n* **For y-terms:**  Take half of the coefficient of the y-term (-6), square it (9), and add it to both sides:\n   x\u00b2 - 4x + 4 + y\u00b2 - 6y + 9 - 36 = 0 + 4 + 9\n**2. Rewrite the equation**\n* **Factor the perfect square trinomials:**\n   (x - 2)\u00b2 + (y - 3)\u00b2 - 36 = 13\n* **Move the constant to the right side:**\n   (x - 2)\u00b2 + (y - 3)\u00b2 = 49\n**3. Identify the radius**\nNow the equation is in standard form.  We can see that:\n* The center of the circle is (h, k) = (2, 3)\n* The radius is r\u00b2 = 49, so r = \u221a49 = **7** \n",
        "Here's how to find the radius of the circle:\n**1.

        "### Step 1: Complete the square for both the $x$ and $y$ terms.\nTo do this, we take half of the coefficient of our $x$ term (-4), square it (4), and add it to both sides of the equation. We do the same for the $y$ term (-6), squaring it (9) and adding it to both sides. This gives us:\n$x^2 - 4x + 4 + y^2 - 6y + 9 = 36 + 4 + 9$\n### Step 2: Rewrite the equation in standard form.\nWe can now rewrite the left side of the equation as squared terms:\n$(x - 2)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 49$\n### Step 3: Identify the radius.\nThe standard form of a circle's equation is $(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$, where $(h, k)$ is the center and $r$ is the radius. \nIn our equation, we see that $r^2 = 49$. Therefore, the radius $r = \\sqrt{49} = \\boxed{7}$. \n",
