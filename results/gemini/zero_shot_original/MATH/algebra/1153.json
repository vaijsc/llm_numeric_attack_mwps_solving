    "solution": "Let $x$ be the length of the hypotenuse, and let $y$ be the length of the other leg.  Then we have $x^2-y^2=162^2$.  Factoring both sides gives $(x+y)(x-y)=(2\\times3^4)^2=2^2\\times3^8$.  A pair of positive integers $(x,y)$ gives a solution to this equation if and only if $(x+y)$ and $(x-y)$ are factors whose product is $2^2*3^8$.  For positive integers $a$ and $b$, the equations $x+y=a$ and $x-y=b$ have positive integer solutions if and only if  $a-b$ is an even positive integer.  Thus if $ab=2^2*3^8$ and the difference between $a$ and $b$ is even, then we get a valid triangle with $x+y=a$ and $x-y=b$.  Since $ab$ is even, at least one of the factors is even, and since their difference is even, the other must be as well.  Since $x+y>x-y$ we have $a>b$ i.e. $a>2\\times3^4.$  Since the prime factorization of $a$ must have exactly one $2$, the choices for $a$ that give valid triangles are $2\\times3^5,2\\times3^6,2\\times3^7,2\\times3^8.$  Thus there are $\\boxed{4}$ valid triangles.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**Understanding the Problem**\n* **Right Triangles:**  We're dealing with triangles that have a 90-degree angle.\n* **Pythagorean Theorem:**  In a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (the legs).\n* **Non-congruent:** We want triangles that are different in size and shape.\n**Solution**\n1. **Representing the Sides:** Let the other leg of the triangle have length *b*, and the hypotenuse have length *c*. We know one leg is 162.\n2. **Pythagorean Theorem:**  We can write the Pythagorean Theorem for this triangle:\n   *  162\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n3. **Finding Possible Values of *b*:**  Since we're looking for integer side lengths, we need to find values of *b* that make *c\u00b2* a perfect square.  This means we need to find values of *b\u00b2* such that 162\u00b2 + b\u00b2 is a perfect square.\n4. **Simplifying the Equation:** Notice that 162 = 2 \u00d7 3\u2074.  This allows us to simplify the equation:\n   * (2 \u00d7 3\u2074)\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n   * 2\u00b2 \u00d7 3\u2078 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n   * b\u00b2 = c\u00b2 - 2\u00b2 \u00d7 3\u2078\n5. **Recognizing a Difference of Squares:** The right side of the equation looks like a difference of squares:  (c + 2 \u00d7 3\u2074)(c - 2 \u00d7 3\u2074). \n6. **Finding Factors:** To make *b\u00b2* a perfect square, both (c + 2 \u00d7 3\u2074) and (c - 2 \u00d7 3\u2074) must be perfect squares.\n7. **Finding the Values of *b*:** Let's consider the smallest possible values for (c + 2 \u00d7 3\u2074) and (c - 2 \u00d7 3\u2074) to get the smallest possible values for *b*:\n    * (c + 2 \u00d7 3\u2074) = 3\u00b2  (the smallest perfect square greater than 2 \u00d7 3\u2074)\n    * (c - 2 \u00d7 3\u2074) = 1  (the smallest possible value)\n    Solving this system of equations, we find c = 163 and b = 18.\n8. **Continued Search:** We can continue finding more solutions by increasing the values of (c + 2 \u00d7 3\u2074) and (c - 2 \u00d7 3\u2074), as long as they remain perfect squares.  For example:\n    * (c + 2 \u00d7 3\u2074) = 5\u00b2\n    * (c - 2 \u00d7 3\u2074) = 1\u00b2\n    This gives us c = 325 and b = 182.\n9. **Non-congruent Triangles:**  Each unique pair of values for (c + 2 \u00d7 3\u2074) and (c - 2 \u00d7 3\u2074) will give us a different non-congruent right triangle.  We need to keep finding values until they become too large to create valid triangles (remember the hypotenuse must be longer than either leg).\n**Finding the Number of Triangles**\nTo count the non-congruent triangles, we need to find how many pairs of perfect squares we can use for (c + 2 \u00d7 3\u2074) and (c - 2 \u00d7 3\u2074).  This is equivalent to finding how many pairs of perfect squares have a difference of 2 \u00d7 3\u2074 + 1 = 325.\n*  The difference between consecutive perfect squares increases as the squares get larger. \n*  We need to find the largest perfect square less than 325.  This is 18\u00b2.\n*  We need to find the smallest perfect square greater than 325. This is 19\u00b2.\n*  The only pair of perfect squares with a difference of 325 is 18\u00b2 and 19\u00b2.\n**Conclusion**\nThere is only **one** non-congruent right triangle with integer sides, where one leg is 162. This triangle has sides of length 162, 18, and 163. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding the Problem**\nWe need to find all possible right triangles where one leg is 162 units long, and the other two sides are also integers.  This involves using the Pythagorean Theorem.\n**Pythagorean Theorem**\nThe Pythagorean Theorem states:  *a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2*  where *a* and *b* are the legs of a right triangle and *c* is the hypotenuse.\n**Applying the Theorem**\n* We know one leg is 162, so let's call it *a* = 162. \n* We want to find the other leg (*b*) and the hypotenuse (*c*), which are both integers.\nLet's rewrite the equation:\n* 162\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n**Finding Possibilities**\nTo find possible values for *b* and *c*, we need to consider the following:\n* **b\u00b2 = c\u00b2 - 162\u00b2**  This means the difference between the squares of the hypotenuse and the known leg must be a perfect square (since *b* is an integer).\n* **c > 162**  The hypotenuse must be longer than the other leg.\n**Finding the Squares**\nLet's start by finding some perfect squares that are greater than 162\u00b2 = 26244:\n* 26245 is not a perfect square.\n* 26246 is not a perfect square.\n* ...\n* 26569 = 163\u00b2  (This is a perfect square, and 163 > 162)\n**Finding the Other Leg**\nSince 26569 - 26244 = 325, we know that b\u00b2 = 325.  Taking the square root, we find b = 18.\n**Congruent Triangles**\nThe triangle with legs 162 and 18 and hypotenuse 163 is the only non-congruent right triangle that fits the conditions. Any other right triangle with one leg of 162 would have to have a larger hypotenuse, and therefore a larger other leg.\n**Answer**\nThere is only **one** non-congruent right triangle with one leg of length 162 and all integer sides. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding the Problem**\n* We're looking for right triangles where one leg has a fixed length of 162.\n* We want to find the number of *different* triangles, meaning we don't count triangles that are just scaled versions of each other.\n**Using the Pythagorean Theorem**\nThe Pythagorean Theorem tells us that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (the legs). \nLet:\n*  *a* = 162 (the fixed leg length)\n*  *b* = the other leg length\n*  *c* = the hypotenuse length\nThe Pythagorean Theorem gives us:  *a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2*\n**Finding Possible Values for *b* and *c***\n1. **Substitute *a* = 162:**  162\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n2. **Simplify:** 26244 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2\nNow we need to find integer values for *b* and *c* that satisfy this equation. Notice that:\n* *b* must be greater than 0 (since it's a side length).\n* *c* must be greater than *a* (the hypotenuse is always the longest side).\n**Finding Solutions**\nSince 162 is a multiple of 2 and 3, we can look for solutions where *b* and *c* also share those factors.  Let's explore some possibilities:\n* **If *b* is a multiple of 2:**  The square of *b* will be a multiple of 4.  Since 162\u00b2 is also a multiple of 4, *c\u00b2* will be a multiple of 4, meaning *c* must also be a multiple of 2.\n* **If *b* is a multiple of 3:** Similar logic applies.\nWe can use these observations to narrow down our search.  For example, we could start by trying values of *b* that are multiples of 6 (since they are multiples of both 2 and 3).\n**Example:**\nLet's try *b* = 6:\n* 162\u00b2 + 6\u00b2 = 26244 + 36 = 26280\n* Since 26280 is not a perfect square, *c* is not an integer, so this doesn't work.\nWe can continue trying different values of *b* (multiples of 2, 3, 6, etc.) until we find a solution where *c* is also an integer.\n**Important Note:** It's helpful to use the fact that the Pythagorean triples (sets of integers that satisfy the Pythagorean Theorem) often have patterns.  For example, (3, 4, 5) is a basic Pythagorean triple, and we can scale it up to find more (6, 8, 10), (9, 12, 15), and so on.  \n**Finding Non-Congruent Triangles**\nOnce you find a solution, keep in mind that any multiple of that solution will also be a valid right triangle but will be congruent to the original.  Therefore, you need to find the *smallest* possible values for *b* and *c* to ensure you are counting distinct (non-congruent) triangles.\n**Let me know if you'd like to continue exploring values for *b* and *c* to find the complete set of non-congruent right triangles.** \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem:\n**Understanding the Problem**\nWe need to find right triangles where one leg is 162 units long, and the other two sides (the other leg and the hypotenuse) have integer lengths.  We want to count how many *different* (non-congruent) triangles fit this description.\n**Using the Pythagorean Theorem**\nThe Pythagorean Theorem tells us that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (the legs).  Let's represent the unknown leg as *b* and the hypotenuse as *c*:\n*  a = 162 \n*  b = unknown\n*  c = unknown\nWe can write the Pythagorean Theorem for this triangle as:\n*  162\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n**Finding Integer Solutions**\nTo find integer solutions for *b* and *c*, we need to find pairs of perfect squares that differ by 162\u00b2.  Here's how we can approach this:\n1. **Factor 162\u00b2:**  162\u00b2 = (2 * 3\u2074 * 3)\u00b2 = 2\u00b2 * 3\u2078\n2. **Think about Squares:**  Notice that any perfect square can be written as a product of squares of prime factors. For example, 36 = 2\u00b2 * 3\u00b2.  We need to find two perfect squares that differ by 2\u00b2 * 3\u2078.\n3. **Find Possible Differences:**  We need to find pairs of squares that differ by 2\u00b2 * 3\u2078. One way to do this is to consider the factors of 2\u00b2 * 3\u2078. Since the difference between the squares must be a perfect square, we can try to express 2\u00b2 * 3\u2078 as the difference of squares of numbers containing factors of 2 and 3.\n4. **Trial and Error:**  Let's try a few possibilities:\n   * **Difference of (2 * 3\u2074)\u00b2 and (3\u2074)\u00b2:**  This gives us 2\u00b2 * 3\u2078, but these squares are not the squares of integers. \n   * **Difference of (2 * 3\u2075)\u00b2 and (3\u2075)\u00b2:**  This also gives us 2\u00b2 * 3\u2078, but these squares are not the squares of integers either. \n   We need to keep experimenting.  It's helpful to remember that the difference of squares factors: a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = (a + b)(a - b).  We can try to factor 2\u00b2 * 3\u2078 into two factors that are themselves the sum and difference of two squares.\n5. **Finding the Solution:**  After some exploration, we find that:\n   * 2\u00b2 * 3\u2078 = (2 * 3\u2074 + 1)(2 * 3\u2074 - 1)  \n   Now, notice that:\n   * 2 * 3\u2074 + 1 = 163 = 163\u00b2 \n   * 2 * 3\u2074 - 1 = 161 = 161\u00b2\n   Therefore, we have:\n   * c\u00b2 = 162\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 163\u00b2\n   * b\u00b2 = 163\u00b2 - 162\u00b2 = (163 + 162)(163 - 162) = 325 * 1 = 325 \n   This means *b* = \u221a325 = 5\u221a13.  Since we need *b* to be an integer, this solution doesn't work.\n**Conclusion**\nSince we haven't found any integer solutions for *b* and *c* that satisfy the Pythagorean Theorem, there are **no** non-congruent right triangles with one leg of length 162 and all integer side lengths. \n",
