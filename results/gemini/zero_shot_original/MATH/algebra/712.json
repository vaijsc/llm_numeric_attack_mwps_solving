        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the midpoints:**\n* **Midpoint of (0, 0) and (2, 2):** \n   The midpoint formula is  ((x1 + x2)/2, (y1 + y2)/2)\n   So, the midpoint is ((0 + 2)/2, (0 + 2)/2) = (1, 1)\n* **Midpoint of (5, 0) and (6, 2):**\n   The midpoint is ((5 + 6)/2, (0 + 2)/2) = (5.5, 1)\n**2. Find the slope:**\n* **Slope formula:**  (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n* Using the midpoints we found: (1 - 1) / (5.5 - 1) = 0 / 4.5 = **0**\n**Therefore, the slope of the line containing the two midpoints is 0.** \n",
