    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "First we find that the slope of the line is $\\frac{4 - 3}{7 - 6} = 1$.  Now, for any other point, $P = (x, y)$, to be on this line, the slope between $P$ and either of $(7, 4)$ or $(6, 3)$ must be equal to 1.  Thus $\\frac{y - 3}{x - 6} = 1 \\Rightarrow y = x - 3$.  A line crosses the $x$-axis when it has $y = 0$.  Plugging this in for our line we get $0 = x - 3 \\Rightarrow x = \\boxed{3}$.",
