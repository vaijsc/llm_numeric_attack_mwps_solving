        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**Understanding Absolute Value**\nThe absolute value of a number is its distance from zero.  So,  \n* |5x - 1| represents the distance of 5x - 1 from zero.\n* |3x + 2| represents the distance of 3x + 2 from zero.\n**Solving the Equation**\nThe equation |5x - 1| = |3x + 2| means that the two expressions have the same distance from zero.  This can happen in two ways:\n* **Case 1:**  5x - 1 = 3x + 2 \n* **Case 2:** 5x - 1 = -(3x + 2)\n**Solving Case 1**\n1. Subtract 3x from both sides: 2x - 1 = 2\n2. Add 1 to both sides: 2x = 3\n3. Divide both sides by 2: x = 3/2\n**Solving Case 2**\n1. Distribute the negative sign: 5x - 1 = -3x - 2\n2. Add 3x to both sides: 8x - 1 = -2\n3. Add 1 to both sides: 8x = -1\n4. Divide both sides by 8: x = -1/8\n**Finding the Smallest Value**\nWe found two possible solutions: x = 3/2 and x = -1/8.  The smaller of these two values is **x = -1/8**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand Absolute Value**\nThe absolute value of a number is its distance from zero.  This means that:\n*  If a number is positive, its absolute value is the same number.\n*  If a number is negative, its absolute value is the positive version of that number.\n**2. Consider the Cases**\nSince we have an absolute value equation, we need to consider two cases:\n* **Case 1:  Both expressions inside the absolute value are positive or both are negative.** \n   This means we can drop the absolute value signs:\n   5x - 1 = 3x + 2\n* **Case 2: One expression inside the absolute value is positive and the other is negative.**\n   This means we need to change the sign of one of the expressions:\n   5x - 1 = -(3x + 2)\n**3.

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**Understanding Absolute Value**\nThe absolute value of a number is its distance from zero.  This means:\n*  If a number is positive, its absolute value is itself.\n*  If a number is negative, its absolute value is its opposite.\n**Solving the Equation**\nSince we have an absolute value on both sides, we need to consider two cases:\n**Case 1:  Both expressions inside the absolute value are positive**\n*  5x - 1 > 0  and  3x + 2 > 0\n*  Solving these inequalities, we get x > 1/5 and x > -2/3.  The intersection of these solutions is x > 1/5.\n**Case 2:  Both expressions inside the absolute value are negative**\n*  5x - 1 < 0 and 3x + 2 < 0\n*  Solving these inequalities, we get x < 1/5 and x < -2/3.  The intersection of these solutions is x < -2/3.\n**Solving for x**\nNow we have two possible scenarios:\n* **Scenario 1:** If x > 1/5, then we can remove the absolute value signs and solve the equation directly:\n   5x - 1 = 3x + 2\n   2x = 3\n   x = 3/2\n* **Scenario 2:** If x < -2/3, then we need to negate the expressions inside the absolute value signs:\n   -(5x - 1) = -(3x + 2)\n   -5x + 1 = -3x - 2\n   -2x = -3\n   x = 3/2\n**The Solution**\nWe see that the solution x = 3/2 satisfies both scenarios. However, the problem asks for the *smallest* value of x.  The smallest value of x that satisfies the equation is **x = -2/3**. \n"
