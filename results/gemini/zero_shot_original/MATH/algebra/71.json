    "problem": "The ratio of two numbers is $3:5$. When 4 is subtracted from the lesser of the two numbers and 8 is added to the larger of the two, the new ratio is $2:7$. What is the greater of the two numbers before 8 is added to it?",

    "solution": "Let $a$ be the smaller of the two numbers and let $b$ be the larger of the two. Then $\\dfrac{a}{b}=\\dfrac{3}{5}$, so $5a=3b$. Additionally, $\\dfrac{a-4}{b+8}=\\dfrac{2}{7}$, so cross multiplying gives $7(a-4)=2(b+8)$. We now have a system of two linear equations; solving gives $a=12$, $b=20$. Since the question asks us for the value of $b$, our answer is $\\boxed{20}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Set up variables:**\n* Let 'x' represent the common factor in the original ratio of 3:5. \n* This means the smaller number is 3x and the larger number is 5x.\n**2. Express the changes:**\n* When 4 is subtracted from the smaller number, it becomes 3x - 4.\n* When 8 is added to the larger number, it becomes 5x + 8.\n**3. Write the new ratio equation:**\n* The new ratio is 2:7, so we can set up the equation:  (3x - 4) / (5x + 8) = 2/7\n**4. Solve for x:**\n* Cross-multiply: 7(3x - 4) = 2(5x + 8)\n* Simplify: 21x - 28 = 10x + 16\n* Combine like terms: 11x = 44\n* Solve for x: x = 4\n**5. Find the larger number:**\n* The larger number was originally 5x.\n* Substitute x = 4:  5 * 4 = 20\n**Answer:** The greater of the two numbers before 8 is added to it is **20**. \n",

Set up variables:**\n* Let the smaller number be represented by  '3x' (since the ratio is 3:5)\n* Let the larger number be represented by '5x'\n**2. Translate the information into equations:**\n* **Original ratio:**  The ratio of the two numbers is 3:5, so we have the relationship: 3x : 5x \n* **Modified ratio:** When 4 is subtracted from the smaller number and 8 is added to the larger, the new ratio is 2:7. This gives us the equation: (3x - 4) : (5x + 8) = 2 : 7\n**3. Solve the proportion:**\n* Cross-multiply the proportion: 7(3x - 4) = 2(5x + 8)\n* Simplify: 21x - 28 = 10x + 16\n* Combine like terms: 11x = 44\n* Solve for x: x = 4\n**4.
