    "problem": "The 7th and 8th grades have enrollments of 520 and 650 respectively. The two grades have a total of 18 representatives on the Student Council. How many representatives should the 8th grade have if there is to be a fair representation of the two grades?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The 8th grade has $\\frac{650}{520+650} = \\frac{650}{1170} = \\frac{65}{117}$ of the total students. To simplify this fraction further, we notice that $65 = 5 \\cdot 13$. Since $117$ is not divisible by $5$, we test if it's divisible by $13$ and find that $117 = 9 \\cdot 13$. Thus to have fair representation, the 8th grade should have $\\frac{65}{117} \\times 18 = \\frac{5}{9} \\times 18 = \\boxed{10}$ of the $18$ representatives.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the total enrollment:**\n* 7th grade enrollment + 8th grade enrollment = Total enrollment\n* 520 + 650 = 1170 students\n**2. Calculate the proportion of students in each grade:**\n* 7th grade proportion = (7th grade enrollment / Total enrollment) = 520 / 1170 \u2248 0.44 \n* 8th grade proportion = (8th grade enrollment / Total enrollment) = 650 / 1170 \u2248 0.56\n**3. Determine the fair number of representatives for each grade:**\n* Multiply each grade's proportion by the total number of representatives:\n    * 7th grade representatives \u2248 0.44 * 18 \u2248 7.92 \n    * 8th grade representatives \u2248 0.56 * 18 \u2248 10.08\n**4. Round to the nearest whole number:**\n* Since you can't have a fraction of a representative, round the results:\n    * 7th grade representatives \u2248 8\n    * 8th grade representatives \u2248 10\n**Answer:** The 8th grade should have **10** representatives for a fair representation. \n",
