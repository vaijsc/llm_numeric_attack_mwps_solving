        "Here's how to solve the problem step by step:\n**1. Combine the terms on the left side:**\nTo make the equation easier to work with, let's combine the fractions on the left side:\n```\n  3/x + x/3 = b \n  (9 + x^2) / 3x = b\n```\n**2. Multiply both sides by 3x:**\nSince we are given that x \u2260 0, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3x without introducing any extraneous solutions:\n```\n  9 + x^2 = 3bx\n```\n**3. Rearrange into a quadratic equation:**\nTo see how this equation relates to having one solution, let's rearrange it into a quadratic form:\n```\n  x^2 - 3bx + 9 = 0 \n```\n**4. Apply the discriminant:**\nA quadratic equation of the form ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0 has one solution if and only if its discriminant, \u0394 = b\u00b2 - 4ac, is equal to zero.  \nIn our case, a = 1, b = -3b, and c = 9.  Let's substitute these values into the discriminant and set it equal to zero:\n```\n  (-3b)\u00b2 - 4(1)(9) = 0\n  9b\u00b2 - 36 = 0\n```\n**5. Solve for b:**\nNow we have a simple quadratic equation for b. Let's solve for b:\n```\n  9b\u00b2 = 36\n  b\u00b2 = 4\n  b = \u00b12\n```\n**6. Choose the positive value:**\nThe problem asks for the *positive* value of b.  Therefore, the solution is:\n```\n  b = 2 \n```\n**In conclusion:** The positive value of *b* that makes the equation have exactly one solution is **b = 2**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Simplify the equation:**\n* Find a common denominator for the fractions on the left side: \n   \n   ```\n   (3 * 3) / (x * 3) + (x * x) / (3 * x) = b\n   9/3x + x^2/3x = b\n   (9 + x^2) / 3x = b \n   ```\n**2. Analyze the conditions for one solution:**\n* For the equation to have exactly one solution, the numerator (9 + x\u00b2) must always be positive.  Since x\u00b2 is always non-negative, 9 + x\u00b2 is always positive. \n* The denominator (3x) cannot be zero. Since x \u2260 0, the denominator is always non-zero. \n**3. Solve for b:**\n* Since the numerator is always positive and the denominator is always non-zero, the equation will always have a single solution for any value of b.  \n**4. Find the positive value of b:**\n* Since the problem asks for a **positive** value of b, any positive value will work.  \n**Therefore, any positive value of b will satisfy the condition for the equation to have exactly one solution.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Combine the terms on the left side:**\nTo simplify the equation, we need to get a common denominator:\n```\n(3/x) + (x/3) = b \n(9 + x^2) / (3x) = b\n```\n**2. Analyze the equation for a single solution:**\nThe equation will have exactly one solution if the numerator, (9 + x^2), is always positive.  Here's why:\n* **Positive numerator:** Since x^2 is always non-negative,  9 + x^2 will always be positive. \n* **Positive denominator:**  The denominator, 3x, will be positive as long as x is positive.\n**3. Find the value of b:**\nSince (9 + x^2) / (3x) will always be positive for any non-zero value of x, the only way the equation will have exactly one solution is if the right side, b, is positive. \n**Conclusion:**\nTherefore, the positive value of b that will ensure the equation has exactly one solution is any **positive value of b**. \n",
        "Here's how we can solve the problem:\n**1. Simplify the Equation**\nFirst, let's get a common denominator on the left side of the equation:\n```\n(3 * 3) / (x * 3) + (x * x) / (3 * x) = b\n9/3x + x^2/3x = b\n(9 + x^2) / 3x = b\n```\n**2. Analyze the Equation**\nNow we have the equation:\n```\n(9 + x^2) / 3x = b\n```\n* **The numerator (9 + x^2) is always positive** because x^2 is always non-negative. \n* **The denominator (3x) can be positive or negative** depending on the value of x. \n**3. Conditions for One Solution**\nFor the equation to have exactly one solution, the denominator must be non-zero. This means:\n* **x cannot equal 0.**  We were already given this condition in the problem.\n**4. Finding the Value of b**\nTo have only one solution, the left side of the equation must be a constant value.  This will happen when the denominator is a constant.  Since we already know that x cannot be zero, we can manipulate the equation to get rid of the x in the denominator.\n* **Multiply both sides by 3x:**\n```\n(9 + x^2) = 3xb\n```\n* **Since the left side is a function of x, for the equation to have only one solution, the right side must also be a function of x. Therefore,  b must equal zero.**\n**5. The Solution**\nThe positive value of b that makes the equation have exactly one solution is **b = 0**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Combine the fractions on the left side:**\nTo do this, we need a common denominator:\n```\n(3/x) + (x/3) = (9 + x^2) / (3x) \n```\n**2. Set up the equation with only one solution:**\nWe want the equation (9 + x^2) / (3x) = b to have exactly one solution.  This means the expression on the left side should be a constant.\n**3. Analyze the expression:**\nThe expression (9 + x^2) / (3x) will be a constant if the numerator (9 + x^2) is a multiple of the denominator (3x).  Since 9 is a constant, the only way this can happen is if x^2 is a multiple of 3x. \n**4.  Find the condition for x^2 to be a multiple of 3x:**\nFor x^2 to be a multiple of 3x, x must be a multiple of 3.  Let's write x as 3k, where k is any integer.\n**5. Substitute x = 3k into the equation:**\nSubstituting, we get:\n```\n(9 + (3k)^2) / (3 * 3k) = (9 + 9k^2) / (9k) = 1 + k^2/k = 1 + k\n```\n**6. Determine the value of b:**\nSince x = 3k, the equation has only one solution for every value of k.  This means the expression (1 + k) can take on any value.  Therefore, the value of b can be any real number.\n**7. Find the positive value of b:**\nSince the problem asks for the positive value of b, we can choose any positive number.  \n**Answer:** The positive value of b that satisfies the conditions of the problem is any positive number.  For example, b = 1, b = 2, b = 3.5, etc., would all work. \n"
