        "Here's how to solve the equation step-by-step:\n1. **Combine like terms:**  The left side of the equation has six identical terms of $6^x$.  Combining them, we get: \n   \n   6 * (6^x) = 6^6\n2. **Simplify using exponent rules:**  Remember that multiplying exponents with the same base means adding the powers: \n   6^(x+1) = 6^6\n3. **Equate exponents:**  Since the bases are the same, for the equation to hold true, the exponents must be equal.  Therefore:\n   x + 1 = 6\n4. **Solve for x:** Subtract 1 from both sides to isolate x:\n   x = 5\n**Therefore, the value of x is 5.** \n",
