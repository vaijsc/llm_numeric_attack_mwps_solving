        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n1. **Substitute the values:** We are given that $a = 3$ and $b = 11$.  Substitute these values into the given equation: \n   \n   $$3 \\star 11 = \\dfrac{\\left(\\dfrac{1}{11} - \\dfrac{1}{3}\\right)}{(3 - 11)}$$\n2. **Simplify the fractions inside the parentheses:** Find a common denominator for the fractions inside the parentheses:\n   $$\\dfrac{\\left(\\dfrac{3}{33} - \\dfrac{11}{33}\\right)}{(3 - 11)}$$\n   Simplify:\n   $$\\dfrac{\\left(\\dfrac{-8}{33}\\right)}{(-8)}$$\n3. **Divide by the denominator:** Dividing by a number is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal.  The reciprocal of -8 is -1/8:\n   $$\\dfrac{-8}{33} \\times \\dfrac{-1}{8}$$\n4. **Simplify:**  Cancel the common factor of 8:\n   $$\\dfrac{1}{33}$$\n**Therefore, 3 \u22c6 11 expressed as a common fraction is 1/33.** \n",
