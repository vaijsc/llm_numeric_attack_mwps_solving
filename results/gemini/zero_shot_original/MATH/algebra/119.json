        "Here's a step-by-step solution:\n**1. Use the vertex form of the parabola:**\nSince we know the vertex is (p, p), we can use the vertex form of a parabola to write the equation:\n  *  y = a(x - p)\u00b2 + p \n**2. Use the y-intercept to find 'c':**\nWe know the parabola passes through the point (0, -p).  Substitute these values into the equation:\n  * -p = a(0 - p)\u00b2 + p\n  * -p = ap\u00b2 + p\n  * -2p = ap\u00b2\n  * a = -2/p \n**3. Substitute 'a' back into the vertex form:**\n  * y = (-2/p)(x - p)\u00b2 + p\n**4. Expand the equation:**\n  * y = (-2/p)(x\u00b2 - 2px + p\u00b2) + p\n  * y = (-2/p)x\u00b2 + 4x - 2p + p\n  * y = (-2/p)x\u00b2 + 4x - p\n**5. Identify 'b':**\nComparing this equation to the standard form (y = ax\u00b2 + bx + c), we see that **b = 4**.\n**Therefore, b = 4.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the information given:**\n* **Vertex:** The vertex of the parabola is at (p, p). This means the parabola is symmetric about the vertical line x = p.\n* **y-intercept:** The parabola intersects the y-axis at (0, -p).\n**2. Use the vertex form of the parabola:**\nThe vertex form of a parabola is given by:\ny = a(x - h)\u00b2 + k\nwhere (h, k) is the vertex.\n**3.

Solve for 'a':**\nSimplify the equation:\n-p = ap\u00b2 + p\n-2p = ap\u00b2\na = -2/p\n**5. Use the standard form of the parabola:**\nThe standard form of a parabola is:\ny = ax\u00b2 + bx + c\nSubstitute the value of 'a' we just found:\ny = (-2/p)x\u00b2 + bx + c\n**6. Use the y-intercept to find 'c':**\nSubstitute the y-intercept (0, -p) into the equation:\n-p = (-2/p)(0)\u00b2 + b(0) + c\nc = -p\n**7. Find 'b':**\nSince the parabola is symmetric about the line x = p, the x-coordinate of the vertex (p) is also the average of the x-coordinates of the two points where the parabola intersects the x-axis. \nThe y-intercept is (0, -p), and the other x-intercept has the same y-coordinate (-p). Let's call the x-coordinate of this other intercept 'r'.  Since the average of these two x-coordinates is p, we have:\n(0 + r)/2 = p\nr = 2p\nNow, substitute the x-intercept (2p, -p) into the standard form of the equation:\n-p = (-2/p)(2p)\u00b2 + b(2p) - p\n-p = -8p + 2bp - p\n2bp = 8p\nb = 4\n**Therefore, the value of b is 4.** \n",
