        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Expand the product:**\nWe need to multiply the two polynomials:\n(3t\u00b2 + 5t + a)(4t\u00b2 + bt - 2) = 12t\u2074 + 26t\u00b3 - 8t\u00b2 - 16t + 6\n**2. Focus on specific terms:**\nTo find *a* and *b*, let's look at the coefficients of the terms that contain them:\n* **t\u00b2 term:** The coefficient of t\u00b2 in the expanded product comes from multiplying the constant term of the first polynomial (a) by the t\u00b2 term of the second polynomial (4t\u00b2), and from multiplying the t term of the first polynomial (5t) by the t term of the second polynomial (bt).  \n   This gives us: 4a + 5b.  We know this coefficient should be -8.\n* **t term:** The coefficient of t in the expanded product comes from multiplying the constant term of the first polynomial (a) by the t term of the second polynomial (bt), and from multiplying the t term of the first polynomial (5t) by the constant term of the second polynomial (-2).\n   This gives us: ab - 10. We know this coefficient should be -16.\n**3. Formulate a system of equations:**\nNow we have two equations:\n* 4a + 5b = -8\n* ab - 10 = -16\n**4. Solve for a and b:**\nWe can solve this system of equations.  One way is to solve the second equation for ab:\n* ab = -6\nThen substitute this into the first equation:\n* 4a + 5b = -8\n* 4a + 5(-6/a) = -8 \nMultiply both sides of the second equation by a:\n* 4a\u00b2 - 30 = -8a\nRearrange into a quadratic equation:\n* 4a\u00b2 + 8a - 30 = 0\nDivide by 2:\n* 2a\u00b2 + 4a - 15 = 0\nFactor the quadratic:\n* (2a - 3)(a + 5) = 0\nThis gives us two possible solutions for a:\n* a = 3/2\n* a = -5\nLet's substitute these values back into the equation ab = -6 to find the corresponding values of b:\n* If a = 3/2, then b = -4\n* If a = -5, then b = 6/5\n**5. Calculate a + b:**\nWe have two possible solutions for (a, b): \n* (a, b) = (3/2, -4)  --> a + b = -5/2\n* (a, b) = (-5, 6/5) --> a + b = -19/5\n**Therefore, there are two possible values for a + b: -5/2 or -19/5** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Expand the Product**\nWe need to multiply the two trinomials:\n(3t\u00b2 + 5t + a)(4t\u00b2 + bt - 2) \nTo do this, we can use the distributive property (or the FOIL method for multiplying binomials) multiple times.  Let's start by distributing the first term of the first trinomial:\n3t\u00b2 * (4t\u00b2 + bt - 2) = 12t\u2074 + 3bt\u00b3 - 6t\u00b2\nNext, distribute the second term:\n5t * (4t\u00b2 + bt - 2) = 20t\u00b3 + 5bt\u00b2 - 10t\nFinally, distribute the third term:\na * (4t\u00b2 + bt - 2) = 4at\u00b2 + abt - 2a\n**2. Combine Like Terms**\nNow we have:\n12t\u2074 + 3bt\u00b3 - 6t\u00b2 + 20t\u00b3 + 5bt\u00b2 - 10t + 4at\u00b2 + abt - 2a \nCombine the terms with the same powers of t:\n12t\u2074 + (3b + 20)t\u00b3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t\u00b2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a\n**3. Match Coefficients**\nWe are given that this expanded product is equal to 12t\u2074 + 26t\u00b3 - 8t\u00b2 - 16t + 6.  We can match the coefficients of the corresponding terms:\n* **t\u2074:**  12 = 12 (This confirms our expansion is correct)\n* **t\u00b3:** 3b + 20 = 26 \n* **t\u00b2:** -6 + 5b + 4a = -8\n* **t:** -10 + ab = -16\n* **Constant:** -2a = 6\n**4. Solve the System of Equations**\nNow we have a system of equations.  Let's solve for a and b:\n* **From the t\u00b3 term:** 3b = 6, so b = 2\n* **From the constant term:** -2a = 6, so a = -3\n**5. Calculate a + b**\nFinally,  a + b = (-3) + 2 = **-1** \n",
