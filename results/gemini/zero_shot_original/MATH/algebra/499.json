        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**Understanding Logarithms**\nThe expression $\\log_{8}{2938}$ asks: \"To what power must we raise 8 to get 2938?\"\n**Finding Bounds**\n* **Lower Bound:**  We know that 8 cubed (8\u00b3) is 512.  Since 2938 is larger than 512, we know the logarithm must be greater than 3.  So,  *a* = 3.\n* **Upper Bound:**  Let's try 8 to the fourth power (8\u2074). This is 4096, which is greater than 2938.  This means the logarithm must be less than 4. So, *b* = 4.\n**The Answer**\nSince *a* = 3 and *b* = 4,  *a + b* = **7**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**Understanding Logarithms**\nThe expression $\\log_{8}{2938}$ asks: \"What power do we need to raise 8 to in order to get 2938?\"\n**Estimating**\n* **Find powers of 8:**  Let's start by finding some powers of 8: \n    * 8\u00b9 = 8\n    * 8\u00b2 = 64\n    * 8\u00b3 = 512\n    * 8\u2074 = 4096\n* **Compare:**  Notice that 2938 is between 512 (8\u00b3) and 4096 (8\u2074).\n**The Answer**\nSince 2938 is closer to 4096, we know that the logarithm will be slightly less than 4.  Therefore:\n*  *a* = 3 (because 8\u00b3 is less than 2938)\n*  *b* = 4 (because 8\u2074 is greater than 2938)\n**Finally, we calculate:**\n* a + b = 3 + 4 = **7** \n",

Find Bounds**\n* **Lower Bound:**  We know 8 cubed (8 x 8 x 8) is 512.  So, 8 raised to a power slightly greater than 3 will give us a number larger than 512.\n* **Upper Bound:**  Let's try 8 to the fourth power (8 x 8 x 8 x 8), which is 4096. This is larger than 2938. \n**3. Conclude**\n* Since 8 cubed (512) is less than 2938, and 8 to the fourth power (4096) is greater than 2938, we know:\n    *  3 <  $\\log_{8}{2938}$ < 4 \n**4. Answer**\n* Therefore, the consecutive integers *a* and *b* are 3 and 4.\n*  a + b = 3 + 4 = **7** \n",
