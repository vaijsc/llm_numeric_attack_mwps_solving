        "Here's how to find the range of the function:\n**1. Analyze the function:**\n* The function  *j(x) = 2x\u00b2 + 1* is a quadratic function, which means its graph is a parabola.\n* The coefficient of the x\u00b2 term is positive (2), indicating the parabola opens upwards.\n**2. Find the minimum value:**\n* Since the parabola opens upwards, its minimum value occurs at the vertex.\n* The x-coordinate of the vertex is given by -b/2a, where a and b are the coefficients of the quadratic. In this case, a = 2 and b = 0, so the x-coordinate of the vertex is 0.\n* Substitute x = 0 into the function to find the minimum value: j(0) = 2(0)\u00b2 + 1 = 1.\n**3. Determine the maximum value:**\n* To find the maximum value, we need to evaluate the function at the endpoints of the domain.\n* j(-1) = 2(-1)\u00b2 + 1 = 3\n* j(2) = 2(2)\u00b2 + 1 = 9\n**4. Combine the minimum and maximum values:**\n* The minimum value of j(x) is 1, and the maximum value is 9.\n* Since the function is continuous and the parabola opens upwards, it takes on all values between the minimum and maximum.\n**5. Express the range as an interval:**\n* The range of j(x) is **[1, 9]**. \n",

        "Here's how to find the range of the function:\n**1. Identify the type of function:**\nThe function $j(x) = 2x^2 + 1$ is a quadratic function. Its graph is a parabola.\n**2. Determine the vertex:**\n* Since the coefficient of the $x^2$ term is positive, the parabola opens upwards.\n* The vertex of the parabola is the minimum point. \n* We can find the x-coordinate of the vertex using the formula: $x = \\frac{-b}{2a}$, where $a=2$ and $b=0$ (from the function $j(x)$).  \n* Therefore, the x-coordinate of the vertex is $x = 0$.\n* To find the y-coordinate of the vertex, we substitute $x=0$ into the function:  $j(0) = 2(0)^2 + 1 = 1$. \n* So, the vertex is at the point (0, 1).\n**3. Consider the endpoints of the domain:**\n* The domain of the function is $[-1, 2]$.  Let's evaluate the function at the endpoints:\n    * $j(-1) = 2(-1)^2 + 1 = 3$\n    * $j(2) = 2(2)^2 + 1 = 9$\n**4. Determine the range:**\n* Since the parabola opens upwards and the vertex is at (0, 1), the function takes on all values greater than or equal to 1.\n* We also found that the function reaches values of 3 and 9 at the endpoints of the domain.\n**Therefore, the range of the function $j(x)$ is [1, 9].** \n",
        "Here's how to find the range of the function:\n**1. Analyze the function:**\n* The function  *j(x) = 2x\u00b2 + 1* is a quadratic function. Its graph is a parabola opening upwards.\n**2. Consider the domain:**\n* The domain of *j(x)* is restricted to the interval [-1, 2]. This means we only need to consider the behavior of the parabola within this interval.\n**3. Find the minimum value:**\n* Since the parabola opens upwards, the minimum value occurs at the vertex.  The x-coordinate of the vertex is given by *x = -b / 2a*, where *a* and *b* are the coefficients of the quadratic. In our case, *a = 2* and *b = 0*, so the x-coordinate of the vertex is *x = 0*.\n* Plugging *x = 0* into the function, we get *j(0) = 2(0)\u00b2 + 1 = 1*. This is the minimum value of the function.\n**4. Find the maximum value:**\n* We need to check the function's values at the endpoints of the domain, *x = -1* and *x = 2*:\n    * *j(-1) = 2(-1)\u00b2 + 1 = 3*\n    * *j(2) = 2(2)\u00b2 + 1 = 9*\n* The maximum value occurs at *x = 2*, where *j(2) = 9*.\n**5.

        "Here's how to find the range of the function:\n**1. Analyze the function:**\n* The function is a quadratic function (a parabola) that opens upwards because the coefficient of the $x^2$ term is positive. This means it has a minimum value.\n**2. Find the minimum value:**\n* The minimum value occurs at the vertex of the parabola. The x-coordinate of the vertex is given by  $-b/(2a)$ where $a$ and $b$ are the coefficients of the quadratic.
