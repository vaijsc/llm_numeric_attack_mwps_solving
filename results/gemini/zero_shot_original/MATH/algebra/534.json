    "problem": "Recently, Frank took a one-hundred question aptitude test where each correct answer scored $5$ points, each incorrect answer scored $-2$ points, and each question not answered scored zero points. Frank answered $80$ questions and scored $232$ points. How many questions did he answer correctly?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let the number of questions Frank answered correctly be $a$ and the number of questions he answered incorrectly be $b$. We have the two equations \\begin{align*}\na+b&=80\\\\\n5a-2b&=232\n\\end{align*} From the first equation, we have $b=80-a$. Substituting this into the second equation to eliminate $b$, we have $5a-2(80-a)=232\\Rightarrow a=56$. Thus, Frank answered $\\boxed{56}$ questions correctly.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Figure out the points from unanswered questions:**\n* Frank answered 80 questions out of 100, so he left 20 questions unanswered.\n* Since unanswered questions score 0 points, the unanswered questions contributed 20 * 0 = 0 points to his total score.\n**2. Figure out the points from incorrect answers:**\n* Let 'x' represent the number of questions Frank answered incorrectly.\n* The points from incorrect answers are -2x.\n**3. Set up an equation:**\n* The total points earned from correct answers plus the points from incorrect answers must equal his total score.  \n* This gives us the equation: 5(80 - x) - 2x = 232\n**4. Solve for x:**\n* 400 - 5x - 2x = 232\n* -7x = -168\n* x = 24\n**5. Find the number of correct answers:**\n* Frank answered 80 questions in total, and 24 were incorrect.\n* Therefore, he answered 80 - 24 = 56 questions correctly.\n**Answer:** Frank answered **56** questions correctly. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Calculate the potential points from answered questions:**\n* Frank answered 80 questions, and each correct answer is worth 5 points, so the maximum points he could have earned from answered questions is 80 * 5 = 400 points.\n**2.  Determine the difference between his potential points and his actual score:**\n* The difference between his potential points (400) and his actual score (232) is 400 - 232 = 168 points.\n**3.  Analyze the point deductions:**\n*  Each incorrect answer deducts 2 points.  The difference of 168 points means he answered 168 / 2 = 84 questions incorrectly.\n**4.  Calculate the number of correct answers:**\n* Frank answered 80 questions in total, and 84 of them were incorrect. Therefore, he answered 80 - 84 = -4 questions correctly.\n**5.  Address the illogical outcome:**\n* The result of -4 correct answers doesn't make sense. This means our initial assumption that he answered 80 questions correctly was wrong. There's likely an error in the problem setup. \n**Conclusion:**\nIt seems there's an error in the problem. It's impossible for Frank to have answered 80 questions, scored 232 points, and had more incorrect answers than total answers.  \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Calculate the points from unanswered questions:**\n* Frank answered 80 questions out of 100, so he left 20 questions unanswered.\n* Since each unanswered question scores 0 points, the unanswered questions contribute 20 * 0 = 0 points to his total score.\n**2. Calculate the total points from correct and incorrect answers:**\n* Frank's total score was 232 points, and 0 points came from unanswered questions. Therefore, his score from correct and incorrect answers is 232 - 0 = 232 points.\n**3. Set up an equation to represent the situation:**\n* Let 'c' be the number of questions Frank answered correctly.\n* He answered 80 questions total, so the number of incorrect answers is 80 - c.\n* The equation representing his score is: 5c - 2(80 - c) = 232\n**4. Solve for 'c':**\n* 5c - 160 + 2c = 232\n* 7c - 160 = 232\n* 7c = 392\n* c = 56\n**Answer:** Frank answered **56** questions correctly. \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Figure out the points from unanswered questions:**\n* Frank answered 80 questions out of 100, so he left 100 - 80 = 20 questions unanswered.\n* Since unanswered questions score 0 points, his unanswered questions contributed 20 * 0 = 0 points to his total score.\n**2.  Calculate the points from incorrect answers:**\n* Let's say Frank answered 'x' questions incorrectly. \n* His incorrect answers earned him -2x points.\n**3. Calculate the points from correct answers:**\n* Frank answered 80 questions, and 'x' of them were incorrect. This means he answered 80 - x questions correctly.\n* His correct answers earned him 5(80 - x) points.\n**4. Set up an equation based on his total score:**\n* His total score is the sum of the points from correct answers, incorrect answers, and unanswered questions: 5(80 - x) + (-2x) + 0 = 232\n**5. Solve for x:**\n* Simplify the equation: 400 - 5x - 2x = 232\n* Combine like terms: -7x = -168\n* Divide both sides by -7: x = 24\n**6. Find the number of correct answers:**\n* Frank answered 80 - 24 = 56 questions correctly.\n**Answer:** Frank answered **56** questions correctly. \n",
