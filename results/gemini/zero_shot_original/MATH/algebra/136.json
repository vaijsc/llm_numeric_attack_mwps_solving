        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the problem:**\nWe need to find the number of values of *x* that make the expression \u221a(120 - \u221a*x*) an integer. \n**2. Analyze the expression:**\n* **Innermost part:** The expression \u221a*x* must be a non-negative real number.\n* **Next layer:** The expression 120 - \u221a*x* must be a non-negative real number since we are taking its square root.\n* **Outermost layer:** The entire expression \u221a(120 - \u221a*x*) must be an integer.\n**3. Find the restrictions:**\n* **\u221a*x*:**  To make \u221a*x* a non-negative real number, *x* must be non-negative (x \u2265 0).\n* **120 - \u221a*x*:**  For 120 - \u221a*x* to be non-negative, \u221a*x* must be less than or equal to 120. This means *x* must be less than or equal to 120\u00b2. \n**4. Consider the outer square root:**\n* Since we want \u221a(120 - \u221a*x*) to be an integer, the expression 120 - \u221a*x* must be a perfect square. \n**5. Find possible values of 120 - \u221a*x*:**\n* The perfect squares less than 120 are 1, 4, 9, 16, ..., 100, 121.\n* We need to find values of \u221a*x* that will make 120 - \u221a*x* equal to one of these perfect squares. \n**6. Test and count:**\n* **If 120 - \u221a*x* = 1**, then \u221a*x* = 119, which means *x* = 119\u00b2 (valid).\n* **If 120 - \u221a*x* = 4**, then \u221a*x* = 116, which means *x* = 116\u00b2 (valid).\n* **...**\n* We continue checking each perfect square until we find a perfect square larger than 120.\n**7. Conclusion:**\nThere are several values of *x* that make \u221a(120 - \u221a*x*) an integer. To find the exact number, we need to continue testing perfect squares as described in step 6.  \n**Key point:** There are a finite number of perfect squares between 1 and 120. This means there are a finite number of solutions for *x*.\n",

This means we need to find values of *x* that, after taking the square root, result in a perfect square that can be subtracted from 120 to leave another perfect square.\n**2.  Work Backwards:**\n* Let's call the integer value of \u221a(120 - \u221a*x*) equal to *y*.  This means:\n   \u221a(120 - \u221a*x*) = *y*\n* Squaring both sides, we get:\n   120 - \u221a*x* = *y*\u00b2\n* Rearranging to isolate \u221a*x*:\n   \u221a*x* = 120 - *y*\u00b2\n* Squaring both sides again:\n   *x* = (120 - *y*\u00b2)\u00b2\n**3. Find the Possibilities for y:**\n* Since we're looking for integer values of *y*, we need to find the perfect squares less than 120. These are: 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, and 100.\n**4. Test the Values of y:**\nFor each of these perfect squares, subtract it from 120 and see if the result is also a perfect square:\n* **y = 0:** 120 - 0\u00b2 = 120 (not a perfect square)\n* **y = 1:** 120 - 1\u00b2 = 119 (not a perfect square)\n* **y = 2:** 120 - 2\u00b2 = 116 (not a perfect square)\n* **y = 3:** 120 - 3\u00b2 = 108 (not a perfect square)\n* **y = 4:** 120 - 4\u00b2 = 104 (not a perfect square)\n* **y = 5:** 120 - 5\u00b2 = 95 (not a perfect square)\n* **y = 6:** 120 - 6\u00b2 = 84 (not a perfect square)\n* **y = 7:** 120 - 7\u00b2 = 71 (not a perfect square)\n* **y = 8:** 120 - 8\u00b2 = 56 (not a perfect square)\n* **y = 9:** 120 - 9\u00b2 = 39 (not a perfect square)\n* **y = 10:** 120 - 10\u00b2 = 20 (not a perfect square)\nNone of the possible values of *y* give us a perfect square when subtracted from 120.\n**5. Conclusion:**\nTherefore, there are **no** real values of *x* that make the expression \u221a(120 - \u221a*x*) an integer. \n",

This means *x* itself must be a perfect square.\n* **Outer Square Root:** 120 - \u221a*x* must also be a perfect square.\n**3. Find Possible Values for \u221a*x***\nSince \u221a*x* is an integer, let's find the possible values for \u221a*x* that make 120 - \u221a*x* a perfect square:\n* **If \u221a*x* = 0**, then 120 - \u221a*x* = 120 (not a perfect square)\n* **If \u221a*x* = 1**, then 120 - \u221a*x* = 119 (not a perfect square)\n* **If \u221a*x* = 2**, then 120 - \u221a*x* = 118 (not a perfect square)\n* **If \u221a*x* = 3**, then 120 - \u221a*x* = 117 (not a perfect square)\n* **If \u221a*x* = 4**, then 120 - \u221a*x* = 116 (not a perfect square)\n* **If \u221a*x* = 5**, then 120 - \u221a*x* = 115 (not a perfect square)\n* **If \u221a*x* = 6**, then 120 - \u221a*x* = 114 (not a perfect square)\n* **If \u221a*x* = 7**, then 120 - \u221a*x* = 113 (not a perfect square)\n* **If \u221a*x* = 8**, then 120 - \u221a*x* = 112 (not a perfect square)\n* **If \u221a*x* = 9**, then 120 - \u221a*x* = 111 (not a perfect square)\n* **If \u221a*x* = 10**, then 120 - \u221a*x* = 110 (not a perfect square)\n* **If \u221a*x* = 11**, then 120 - \u221a*x* = 109 (not a perfect square)\n* **If \u221a*x* = 12**, then 120 - \u221a*x* = 108 = 6\u00b2 (a perfect square!)\n**4.

        "Here's how we can solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understanding the problem:**\nWe need to find the number of real values of *x* that make the expression  \u221a(120 - \u221a*x*) an integer. This means we're looking for values of *x* that, after taking the square root, subtracting from 120, and then taking another square root, result in a whole number.\n**2.  Simplifying the expression:**\nLet's start by simplifying the expression.  Since we want the final result to be an integer, let's set:\n*  \u221a(120 - \u221a*x*) = *n*, where *n* is an integer.\nSquaring both sides, we get:\n* 120 - \u221a*x* = *n*\u00b2\n**3. Isolating the radical:**\nNow, let's isolate the radical:\n* \u221a*x* = 120 - *n*\u00b2\n**4. Analyzing the restrictions:**\n* **Non-negative values:**  Since we're dealing with a square root, the expression inside the radical (120 - *n*\u00b2) must be greater than or equal to zero. This means:\n   * 120 - *n*\u00b2 \u2265 0\n   * *n*\u00b2 \u2264 120 \n* **Perfect squares:** To make \u221a*x* an integer, (120 - *n*\u00b2) must be a perfect square.\n**5. Finding possible values of n:**\nWe need to find integer values of *n* that satisfy both conditions: *n*\u00b2 \u2264 120 and (120 - *n*\u00b2) is a perfect square. \nLet's list out perfect squares less than 120: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100.\nWe can check each of these to see if 120 minus the perfect square is also a perfect square.  We find that:\n* 120 - 100 = 20 (not a perfect square)\n* 120 - 81 = 39 (not a perfect square)\n* 120 - 64 = 56 (not a perfect square)\n* 120 - 49 = 71 (not a perfect square)\n* 120 - 36 = 84 (not a perfect square)\n* 120 - 25 = 95 (not a perfect square)\n* 120 - 16 = 104 (not a perfect square)\n* 120 - 9 = 111 (not a perfect square)\n* 120 - 4 = 116 (not a perfect square)\n* 120 - 1 = 119 (not a perfect square)\n**6. Conclusion:**\nWe find that there are **no** integer values of *n* that satisfy both conditions. Therefore, there are **no** real values of *x* for which \u221a(120 - \u221a*x*) is an integer. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\nWe want to find the values of *x* that make the expression  \u221a(120 - \u221a*x*) an integer.  This means the expression inside the outer square root (120 - \u221a*x*) must also be a perfect square.\n**2. Setting up the Equation**\nLet's represent the integer value of the expression as *k*:\n\u221a(120 - \u221a*x*) = *k*\nSquaring both sides:\n120 - \u221a*x* = *k*\u00b2\n**3. Isolating the Square Root**\n\u221a*x* = 120 - *k*\u00b2\n**4.  Finding Restrictions on *k***\n* **The square root must be non-negative:**  120 - *k*\u00b2 \u2265 0 \n* **The value under the outer square root must also be non-negative:**  120 - \u221a*x* \u2265 0\n**5. Solving the Inequalities**\n* **From the first inequality:** *k*\u00b2 \u2264 120. The largest perfect square less than 120 is 11\u00b2 = 121. So, the possible values of *k* are -11, -10, -9, ..., 9, 10, 11.\n* **From the second inequality:** \u221a*x* \u2264 120, which means *x* \u2264 14400.\n**6.  Checking the Values of *k***\nWe need to check if each possible value of *k* leads to a valid solution for *x*. We can do this by substituting each *k* value into the equation \u221a*x* = 120 - *k*\u00b2, then squaring both sides to find *x*. We only keep values of *x* that satisfy *x* \u2264 14400.\n**7. The Solutions**\nAfter checking each possible value of *k*, we find that the following values of *x* work:\n* **k = 11:**  x = 1 \n* **k = 10:**  x = 400\n* **k = 9:**  x = 2500\n* **k = 8:**  x = 5776\n* **k = 7:**  x = 9025\n* **k = 6:**  x = 12321\n* **k = 5:**  x = 15625\n* **k = 4:**  x = 18921\n* **k = 3:**  x = 22225\n* **k = 2:**  x = 25521\n* **k = 1:**  x = 28825\n* **k = 0:**  x = 32125\n* **k = -1:** x = 35425\n* **k = -2:** x = 38721\n* **k = -3:** x = 42025\n* **k = -4:** x = 45321\n* **k = -5:** x = 48625\n* **k = -6:** x = 51921\n* **k = -7:** x = 55225\n* **k = -8:** x = 58521\n* **k = -9:** x = 61825\n* **k = -10:** x = 65121\n* **k = -11:** x = 68425\n**Therefore, there are 23 real values of *x* that make \u221a(120 - \u221a*x*) an integer.** \n"
