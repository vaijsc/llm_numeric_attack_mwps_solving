        "Here's how to find the distance step-by-step:\n**1. Find the vertex of the parabola**\n* The vertex of a parabola in the form  $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$  is at the point  $x = \\frac{-b}{2a}$.\n* In our case,  $a = 1$ and  $b = -8$.\n* Therefore, the x-coordinate of the vertex is  $x = \\frac{-(-8)}{2(1)} = 4$.\n* To find the y-coordinate, substitute  $x = 4$  into the equation:  $f(4) = 4^2 - 8(4) + 15 = -1$.\n* The vertex of the parabola is $(4, -1)$.\n**2. Use the distance formula**\n* The distance formula is  $\\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$\n* Let $(x_1, y_1) = (4, -1)$ (the vertex) and $(x_2, y_2) = (0, 2)$ (the given point).\n* Plug these values into the distance formula:\n  \n  $\\sqrt{(0 - 4)^2 + (2 - (-1))^2} = \\sqrt{(-4)^2 + (3)^2} = \\sqrt{16 + 9} = \\sqrt{25}$\n**3. Simplify**\n* $\\sqrt{25} = 5$\n**Answer:** The distance between the vertex of the parabola and the point $(0, 2)$ is **5 units**. \n",
