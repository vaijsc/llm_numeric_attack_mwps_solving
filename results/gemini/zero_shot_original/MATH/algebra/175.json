    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "If we knew last year's enrollment at Liberty Middle School, we would multiply by $1.04$ to get the new enrollment of $598$ students. Working backward, we can divide $598$ by $1.04$ to get $\\boxed{575\\text{ students}}$. Alternatively, we could solve the equation $x + 0.04x = 598$, where $x$ is last year's enrollment.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Relationship**\n* The current enrollment (598 students) represents 104% of last year's enrollment (because it's a 4% increase).\n**2. Set up a Proportion**\n* Let 'x' represent last year's enrollment.  We can set up a proportion: \n   * 104% / 100% = 598 students / x \n**3. Solve for x**\n* Cross-multiply: 104% * x = 100% * 598 students\n* Simplify: 1.04x = 598\n* Divide both sides by 1.04: x = 598 / 1.04\n**4.
