        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the given information:**\n* **Invertible function:** This means that for every output value, there's a unique input value. In other words, the function has an inverse.\n* **f(f(x)) = x:** This is the defining property of an inverse function. It tells us that applying the function twice gets us back to the original input.\n**2.  Use the inverse function property:**\nSince we know  *f* is invertible, we can write its inverse as *f\u207b\u00b9(x)*.  Let's apply *f\u207b\u00b9(x)* to both sides of the equation *f(f(x)) = x*:\n*  *f\u207b\u00b9( f(f(x)) ) = f\u207b\u00b9(x)* \n**3. Simplify using the composition property:**\n*  *f\u207b\u00b9(f(f(x))) = f\u207b\u00b9(x)* \n*  *(f\u207b\u00b9 o f)(f(x)) = f\u207b\u00b9(x)*  \n*  *f(x) = f\u207b\u00b9(x)*  (Since the composition of a function and its inverse is the identity function)\n**4. Find f(x) - f\u207b\u00b9(x):**\nNow that we know *f(x) = f\u207b\u00b9(x)*, we can simply substitute:\n*  *f(x) - f\u207b\u00b9(x) = f(x) - f(x) = 0*\n**Therefore, f(x) - f\u207b\u00b9(x) = 0** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Given Information:**\n*  **Invertible Function:**  A function is invertible if it has a unique inverse. This means that for every output, there's only one corresponding input.\n*  **f(f(x)) = x:** This equation tells us that applying the function *f* twice to any input *x* gives us back the original input *x*.  This is a characteristic of inverse functions.\n**2.  Relate the Equation to Inverses:**\nThe equation  *f(f(x)) = x* implies that *f* is its own inverse.  Let's see why:\n* If *f* has an inverse, denoted by *f\u207b\u00b9*, we know that *f\u207b\u00b9(f(x)) = x* for all *x*.\n* Comparing this to *f(f(x)) = x*, we see that *f(x)* must act like the inverse of *f(x)*. Therefore, *f(x) = f\u207b\u00b9(x)*.\n**3.  Solve for f(x) - f\u207b\u00b9(x):**\nSince we've established that *f(x) = f\u207b\u00b9(x)*, we have:\n* f(x) - f\u207b\u00b9(x) = f(x) - f(x) = **0**\n**Therefore, f(x) - f\u207b\u00b9(x) = 0** \n",

Understanding the Given Information**\n* **Invertible function:** This means that for every output value, there is a unique input value. In other words, the function has an inverse, denoted by  f\u207b\u00b9(x).\n* **Domain and Range:** Both the domain and range of f are all real numbers, meaning the function is defined and can take on any value.\n* **The condition f(f(x)) = x:** This tells us that applying the function f twice to any input x returns the original value x. This is a key property of inverse functions.\n**2. Using the Inverse Function Property**\nSince f(f(x)) = x, we can use the inverse function property to deduce that:\n* **f(x) = f\u207b\u00b9(x)** \nThis is because if we apply f\u207b\u00b9 to both sides of the equation f(f(x)) = x, we get:\n* f\u207b\u00b9(f(f(x))) = f\u207b\u00b9(x) \n* f(x) = f\u207b\u00b9(x)  (using the inverse function property)\n**3. Finding f(x) - f\u207b\u00b9(x)**\nNow, since we know f(x) = f\u207b\u00b9(x), we can directly calculate:\n* f(x) - f\u207b\u00b9(x) = f(x) - f(x) = **0**\n**Conclusion**\nTherefore, if f is an invertible function from  (-\u221e,\u221e) to (-\u221e,\u221e) and  f(f(x)) = x, then  f(x) - f\u207b\u00b9(x) = 0. \n",
