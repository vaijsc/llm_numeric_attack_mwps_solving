        "We want to find the exponent to which we need to raise 3 to get 81.  In other words, we want to solve the equation $3^x = 81$.\nSince $81 = 3^4$, we have $3^x = 3^4$.  Therefore, $x = \\boxed{4}$.  So, $\\log_3 81 = 4$. \n",
        "**1. Understand Logarithms**\n   *  A logarithm answers the question: \"What exponent do I need to raise the base to, to get a certain number?\"  \n   * In the expression  log<sub>b</sub>a, we are asking \"What power do I need to raise 'b' to in order to get 'a'?\"\n**2. Apply to the Problem**\n* We have log<sub>3</sub>81.  This means we are looking for the exponent we need to raise 3 to in order to get 81.\n**3. Find the Solution**\n* We know that 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 = 81, or 3<sup>4</sup> = 81. \n* Therefore, log<sub>3</sub>81 = **4** \n",
