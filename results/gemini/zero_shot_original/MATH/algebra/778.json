        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Problem**\nWe're given a quadratic equation and information about the absolute value of the difference between its roots. We need to find the value of the coefficient 'a'.\n**2. Use the Relationship Between Roots and Coefficients**\nFor a quadratic equation of the form  *ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0*, the following relationships hold:\n* **Sum of roots:**  -b/a \n* **Product of roots:** c/a\n**3. Apply the Relationships to the Given Equation**\nIn our equation, *ax\u00b2 + 5x - 3 = 0*:\n* **Sum of roots:**  -5/a \n* **Product of roots:** -3/a\n**4. Express the Difference of Roots**\nLet the roots of the equation be *r* and *s*. We know the absolute value of their difference is  \u221a61/3: \n* |r - s| = \u221a61/3\n**5. Square Both Sides**\nSquaring both sides of the equation:\n* (r - s)\u00b2 = 61/9\n**6. Expand and Relate to Sum and Product**\nExpand the left side:\n* r\u00b2 - 2rs + s\u00b2 = 61/9\nNotice that (r + s)\u00b2 = r\u00b2 + 2rs + s\u00b2\nTherefore, r\u00b2 + s\u00b2 = (r + s)\u00b2 - 2rs \nSubstitute this into the previous equation:\n* (r + s)\u00b2 - 2rs - 2rs = 61/9\n* (r + s)\u00b2 - 4rs = 61/9\n**7. Substitute the Relationships from Step 3**\n* (-5/a)\u00b2 - 4(-3/a) = 61/9\n* 25/a\u00b2 + 12/a = 61/9\n**8. Solve for 'a'**\nMultiply both sides by 9a\u00b2 to get rid of the fractions:\n* 225 + 108a = 61a\u00b2\n* 61a\u00b2 - 108a - 225 = 0\nThis is a quadratic equation.  We can solve it by factoring or using the quadratic formula. Factoring gives us:\n* (61a + 45)(a - 5) = 0\nThis leads to two possible solutions:\n* a = -45/61  or  a = 5\n**9. Consider the Positive Solution**\nSince the problem states that 'a' is positive, the answer is **a = 5**. \n",
