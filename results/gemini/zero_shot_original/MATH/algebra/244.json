    "solution": "An arithmetic sequence is formed by adding the common difference to each term to find the next term.  Thus, the common difference must evenly divide the difference $91-1=90$.  Each factor of 90 will correspond to one possible sequence.  For example, the factor 30 corresponds to the sequence $1,31,61,91,...$.  So, we need to count the factors of 90.  Factoring, we find: $$90=2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 5$$ So, 90 has: $$(1+1)(2+1)(1+1)=12\\text{ factors}$$ This corresponds to $\\boxed{12}$ possible sequences.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand Arithmetic Sequences**\nAn arithmetic sequence is a list of numbers where the difference between any two consecutive terms is constant. This constant difference is called the common difference.\n**2. Set up the Problem**\nWe know:\n* The first term (a) is 1.\n* Another term (let's call it a\u2099) is 91.\n* All terms are integers.\n**3. Use the Arithmetic Sequence Formula**\nThe general formula for an arithmetic sequence is:\na\u2099 = a + (n - 1)d\nwhere:\n* a\u2099 is the nth term\n* a is the first term\n* d is the common difference\n* n is the number of terms\n**4. Substitute and Solve for d**\nWe know a = 1 and a\u2099 = 91. Let's substitute these values into the formula and solve for the common difference (d):\n91 = 1 + (n - 1)d\nSimplifying the equation:\n90 = (n - 1)d\nSince both 90 and (n-1) are integers,  'd' must be a factor of 90.\n**5. Find the Factors of 90**\nThe factors of 90 are: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 15, 18, 30, 45, and 90.\n**6. Consider the Number of Terms**\nFor each factor 'd' of 90, we can find the corresponding 'n' (number of terms) using the equation:\nn = (90/d) + 1\nWe need to make sure that 'n' is an integer, as the number of terms in the sequence must be whole.\n**7. Count the Valid Sequences**\nLet's check each factor of 90 and see if it leads to a valid 'n':\n* d = 1: n = 91 (Valid)\n* d = 2: n = 46 (Valid)\n* d = 3: n = 31 (Valid)\n* d = 5: n = 19 (Valid)\n* d = 6: n = 16 (Valid)\n* d = 9: n = 11 (Valid)\n* d = 10: n = 10 (Valid)\n* d = 15: n = 7 (Valid)\n* d = 18: n = 6 (Valid)\n* d = 30: n = 4 (Valid)\n* d = 45: n = 3 (Valid)\n* d = 90: n = 2 (Valid)\n**8. The Answer**\nWe have found 12 distinct values for 'd' that lead to valid arithmetic sequences. Therefore, there are **12** distinct arithmetic sequences that meet the given conditions. \n",

Understand Arithmetic Sequences**\nAn arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers where the difference between any two consecutive terms is constant. This constant difference is called the common difference.\n**2. Set Up the Equation**\nLet's say the common difference of the sequence is *d*.  Since the first term is 1 and another term is 91, we can write the following equation:\n1 + (n-1)d = 91\nwhere *n* is the position of the term 91 in the sequence.\n**3. Simplify the Equation**\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n(n-1)d = 90\n**4. Factor 90**\nTo find the possible values of *d* and *n*, we need to find the factors of 90.  The factors of 90 are:\n1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 15, 18, 30, 45, 90\n**5. Determine Possible Sequences**\nFor each factor of 90, we can find a corresponding value of *n* that satisfies the equation (n-1)d = 90. Since *n* represents the position of the term 91 in the sequence, it must be an integer greater than 1. \nLet's look at some examples:\n* **d = 1, n = 91:**  The sequence is 1, 2, 3, ... , 91\n* **d = 2, n = 46:** The sequence is 1, 3, 5, ... , 91\n* **d = 3, n = 31:** The sequence is 1, 4, 7, ... , 91\n* **d = 5, n = 19:** The sequence is 1, 6, 11, ... , 91\nAnd so on. You can continue this process for each factor of 90.\n**6. Count the Distinct Sequences**\nFor each factor of 90, we get a distinct arithmetic sequence.

This constant difference is called the common difference.\n**2.  Finding the Common Difference**\nSince 91 is a term in the sequence and the first term is 1, the difference between 91 and 1 must be a multiple of the common difference. \n* 91 - 1 = 90 \n* This means the common difference must be a factor of 90.\n**3. Finding the Factors of 90**\nThe factors of 90 are: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 15, 18, 30, 45, and 90.\n**4.  Determining Valid Common Differences**\n* Each factor of 90 represents a possible common difference. \n* We need to make sure the sequence generated using each common difference has all integer terms.\n**5. Example: Common Difference of 10**\n* If the common difference is 10, the sequence would be: 1, 11, 21, 31, ... , 91.  This sequence works.\n**6. Testing All Factors**\nYou need to check if the sequence formed using each factor of 90 as the common difference produces only integer terms and includes 91.  Some factors will not work.  \n**7.

The factors of 90 are:\n* 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 15, 18, 30, 45, 90\n**5. Determine Valid Combinations**\nSince *n* represents the number of terms, it must be a positive integer greater than 1. Also, *d* is the common difference and must be an integer. We need to find combinations of *n* and *d* that satisfy the equation 90 = (n - 1) * d.\nLet's examine the factors:\n* If *n* = 2, then *d* = 90. This is valid.\n* If *n* = 3, then *d* = 30. This is valid.\n* If *n* = 4, then *d* = 22.5. This is not valid because *d* must be an integer.\n* ... and so on.\nContinue checking the factors to find all valid combinations of *n* and *d*.\n**6. Count the Distinct Sequences**\nYou will find that the following combinations work:\n* (n = 2, d = 90)\n* (n = 3, d = 30)\n* (n = 6, d = 15)\n* (n = 10, d = 9)\n* (n = 11, d = 8)\n* (n = 16, d = 6)\n* (n = 31, d = 3)\n* (n = 91, d = 1)\n**Answer:** There are **8** distinct arithmetic sequences that meet the given conditions. \n"
