    "solution": "We must find the distance between each pair of points.\n\nThe distance between $(1, 2)$ and $(1, 12)$ is simply 10, since these two points have the same $x$-coordinate.\n\nThe distance between $(1, 2)$ and $(7, 10)$ is \\[\\sqrt{(1-7)^2 + (2-10)^2} = \\sqrt{36 + 64} = 10.\\]\n\nThe distance between $(7, 10)$ and $(1, 12)$ is \\[\\sqrt{(7 - 1)^2 + (10 - 12)^2} = \\sqrt{36 + 4} = 2\\sqrt{10}.\\]\n\nOut of 10, 10, and $2\\sqrt{10}$, $2\\sqrt{10}$ is the shortest value. We know this because $\\sqrt{10} > \\sqrt{9}$, so $\\sqrt{10} > 3$, so $2\\sqrt{10} < (\\sqrt{10})^2 = 10$. Thus, the shortest side of the triangle has length $\\boxed{2\\sqrt{10}}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Triangle**\nIt's helpful to sketch the triangle on a coordinate plane. You'll see that it's a right triangle, with the right angle at the vertex (1,2).\n**2. Calculate Side Lengths**\n* **Side 1:** The distance between (1,2) and (1,12) is the vertical difference, which is 12 - 2 = 10 units.\n* **Side 2:** The distance between (1,2) and (7,10) can be found using the distance formula: \n   \u221a[(7-1)\u00b2 + (10-2)\u00b2] = \u221a(36 + 64) = \u221a100 = 10 units.\n* **Side 3:** The distance between (7,10) and (1,12) can also be found using the distance formula:\n   \u221a[(1-7)\u00b2 + (12-10)\u00b2] = \u221a(36 + 4) = \u221a40 units.\n**3. Determine the Shortest Side**\n* The shortest side has a length of \u221a40 units.\n**4. Simplify (Optional)**\nYou can simplify \u221a40 as \u221a(4 * 10) = 2\u221a10 units.\n**Answer:** The shortest side of the triangle has a length of **2\u221a10 units**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Triangle**\nIt's helpful to sketch the triangle on a coordinate plane.  You'll see that two of the vertices are directly above each other (1, 2) and (1, 12).\n**2. Calculate the Length of the Vertical Side**\nThe vertical side is a straight line going from (1, 2) to (1, 12). The difference in the y-coordinates gives us the length: 12 - 2 = 10 units.\n**3. Calculate the Length of the Other Sides**\nWe can use the distance formula to find the length of the other two sides:\n* **Distance between (1, 2) and (7, 10):** \n   \u221a[(7 - 1)\u00b2 + (10 - 2)\u00b2] = \u221a(36 + 64) = \u221a100 = 10 units\n* **Distance between (7, 10) and (1, 12):**\n   \u221a[(1 - 7)\u00b2 + (12 - 10)\u00b2] = \u221a(36 + 4) = \u221a40 \u2248 6.32 units\n**4.

        "1. **Visualize:** Imagine the triangle plotted on a coordinate plane.  You'll see that the side connecting $(1,2)$ and $(1,12)$ is vertical.\n2. **Calculate the length of the vertical side:**  Since the x-coordinates are the same, the length of this side is simply the difference in the y-coordinates: 12 - 2 = 10 units.\n3. **Calculate the other sides (optional):**  You could calculate the lengths of the other two sides using the distance formula, but it's not necessary to determine the shortest side.\n4. **Conclusion:**  The shortest side of the triangle is the vertical side, which has a length of **10 units**. \n",
        "Here's how to find the length of the shortest side:\n**1. Visualize the Triangle**\nIt helps to sketch the triangle.  Notice that two of the vertices have the same x-coordinate (1).

The length is the difference in y-coordinates: 12 - 2 = 10 units.\n* **Horizontal Side:** The horizontal side goes from (1, 2) to (7, 2). The length is the difference in x-coordinates: 7 - 1 = 6 units.\n* **Slanted Side:**  To find the length of the slanted side, we can use the distance formula: \n   *  \u221a[(7 - 1)\u00b2 + (10 - 2)\u00b2] = \u221a(36 + 64) = \u221a100 = 10 units\n**3.
