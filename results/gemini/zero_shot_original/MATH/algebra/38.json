    "solution": "Moving all the terms to the left, we have the equation $x^2-14x+y^2-48y=0$. Completing the square on the quadratic in $x$, we add $(14/2)^2=49$ to both sides. Completing the square on the quadratic in $y$, we add $(48/2)^2=576$ to both sides. We have the equation  \\[(x^2-14x+49)+(y^2-48y+576)=625 \\Rightarrow (x-7)^2+(y-24)^2=625\\] Rearranging, we have $(y-24)^2=625-(x-7)^2$. Taking the square root and solving for $y$, we get $y=\\pm \\sqrt{625-(x-7)^2}+24$. Since $\\sqrt{625-(x-7)^2}$ is always nonnegative, the maximum value of $y$ is achieved when we use a positive sign in front of the square root. Now, we want the largest possible value of the square root. In other words, we want to maximize $625-(x-7)^2$. Since $(x-7)^2$ is always nonnegative, $625-(x-7)^2$ is maximized when $(x-7)^2=0$ or when $x=7$. At this point, $625-(x-7)^2=625$ and $y=\\sqrt{625}+24=49$. Thus, the maximum $y$ value is $\\boxed{49}$.\n\n--OR--\n\nSimilar to the solution above, we can complete the square to get the equation $(x-7)^2+(y-24)^2=625$. This equation describes a circle with center at $(7,24)$ and radius $\\sqrt{625}=25$. The maximum value of $y$ is achieved at the point on the top of the circle, which is located at $(7,24+25)=(7,49)$. Thus, the maximum value of $y$ is $\\boxed{49}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Complete the Square**\nTo find the maximum value of *y*, we need to rewrite the equation in a way that highlights the relationship between *x* and *y*.  We can do this by completing the square:\n* **Rearrange terms:** Move the *x* and *y* terms to the left side and the constant term to the right:\n   *  x\u00b2 - 14x + y\u00b2 - 48y = 0 \n* **Complete the square for *x*:**  Take half of the coefficient of *x* (-14), square it (49), and add it to both sides:\n   *  x\u00b2 - 14x + 49 + y\u00b2 - 48y = 49\n* **Complete the square for *y*:** Take half of the coefficient of *y* (-48), square it (576), and add it to both sides:\n   *  x\u00b2 - 14x + 49 + y\u00b2 - 48y + 576 = 49 + 576 \n* **Rewrite as squares:** Now we can rewrite the left side as squares:\n   *  (x - 7)\u00b2 + (y - 24)\u00b2 = 625\n**2. Interpretation**\nThe equation (x - 7)\u00b2 + (y - 24)\u00b2 = 625 represents a circle with:\n* Center: (7, 24)\n* Radius: \u221a625 = 25\n**3. Finding the Maximum Value of *y***\nSince the circle has a center at (7, 24), the maximum value of *y* occurs at the topmost point of the circle.  This point is 25 units above the center, so:\n* Maximum value of *y* = 24 + 25 = **49** \n",
