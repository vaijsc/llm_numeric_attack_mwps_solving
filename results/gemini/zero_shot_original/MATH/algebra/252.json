        "1. **Rewrite in exponential form:** The equation $\\log_5(x-18) = 2$  means \"5 raised to the power of 2 equals (x-18)\".  This can be written as: \n   \n   $5^2 = x-18$\n2. **Simplify:** Calculate 5 squared:\n   $25 = x-18$\n3. **Solve for x:**  Add 18 to both sides of the equation:\n   $25 + 18 = x$\n   $43 = x$\n**Therefore, x = 43** \n",

        "Here's how to solve the equation step-by-step:\n1. **Convert to exponential form:** \n   The equation  $\\log_5(x-18) = 2$ is in logarithmic form.  To solve for *x*, we need to rewrite it in exponential form.  Remember that the equation $\\log_b a = c$ is equivalent to  $b^c = a$.  Applying this to our problem, we get: \n   \n   $5^2 = x - 18$\n2. **Simplify:**\n   Calculate the left side of the equation: \n   \n   $25 = x - 18$\n3. **Isolate x:**\n   Add 18 to both sides to get *x* by itself:\n   $25 + 18 = x$\n4. **Solve for x:**\n   Simplify to find the solution:\n   $x = 43$\n**Therefore, the solution to the equation is x = 43.** \n",
