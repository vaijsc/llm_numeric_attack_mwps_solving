    "solution": "First, it must be true that $y$ is positive because, otherwise, $\\lceil y\\rceil+y$ would be negative. Since $\\lceil y\\rceil$ is an integer, $0.5$ must be the decimal component of $y$. Therefore, $y$ can be rewritten as $x+0.5$. $\\lceil y\\rceil$ can then also be rewritten as $x+1$. The equation can then be written as $x+1+x+0.5=15.5$. $x$ must then equal $7$, and $y$ can only be $\\boxed{7.5}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**Understanding the Ceiling Function**\nThe ceiling function, denoted by $\\lceil x \\rceil$, gives the smallest integer greater than or equal to *x*.  For example:\n*  $\\lceil 3.2 \\rceil = 4$\n*  $\\lceil 5 \\rceil = 5$\n*  $\\lceil -2.7 \\rceil = -2$\n**Solving the Equation**\n1. **Consider the range of possible values for y:** Since the ceiling function produces an integer, we know that $\\lceil y \\rceil$ is an integer.  Therefore, *y* must be a decimal number.\n2. **Think about the decimal part of y:** Let's express *y* as an integer part plus a decimal part:  *y = n + d*, where *n* is an integer and *0 \u2264 d < 1*.\n3. **Apply the ceiling function:** \n    * $\\lceil y \\rceil = \\lceil n + d \\rceil = n + 1$ (since *d* is a positive decimal)\n4. **Substitute into the equation:**\n    * (n + 1) + (n + d) = 15.5\n    * 2n + d + 1 = 15.5\n    * 2n + d = 14.5\n5. **Solve for *n* and *d*:** Since *n* is an integer, the only way for 2*n* to be close to 14.5 is if *n* = 7. This leaves 0.5 for *d*. \n6. **Find *y*:** Therefore, *y* = 7 + 0.5 = **7.5**.\n**Therefore, the value of y is 7.5.** \n",
