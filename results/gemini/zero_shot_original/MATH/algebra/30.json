    "solution": "Let $f$ be the cost of a pound of feathers and $g$ the cost of an ounce of gold.  We have \\begin{align*}\n8f+2g&=932 \\\\\n14f+3g&=1402\n\\end{align*}Solving the first equation for $g$ we get $g=466-4f$.  Substituting into the second equation, we solve \\[\n14f+3(466-4f)=1402\n\\]to find $f=2$.  Substituting into $g=466-4f$ we have $g=458$.  Thus five pounds of feathers and five ounces of gold costs $5(f+g)=\\boxed{2300}$ dollars.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Set up equations:**\n* Let 'x' represent the cost of one pound of feathers.\n* Let 'y' represent the cost of one ounce of gold.\nWe can translate the given information into two equations:\n* Equation 1: 8x + 2y = 932 \n* Equation 2: 14x + 3y = 1402\n**2. Solve for x and y:**\n* **Method 1: Elimination**\n    * Multiply Equation 1 by -3: -24x - 6y = -2796\n    * Multiply Equation 2 by 2: 28x + 6y = 2804\n    * Add the two equations together: 4x = 8\n    * Solve for x: x = 2\n    * Substitute x = 2 into either Equation 1 or 2 to solve for y.  Let's use Equation 1: \n        * 8(2) + 2y = 932\n        * 16 + 2y = 932\n        * 2y = 916\n        * y = 458\n* **Method 2: Substitution**\n    * Solve Equation 1 for x: x = (932 - 2y) / 8\n    * Substitute this expression for x into Equation 2: 14[(932 - 2y) / 8] + 3y = 1402\n    * Simplify and solve for y: y = 458\n    * Substitute y = 458 back into either Equation 1 or 2 to solve for x.  You'll find x = 2.\n**3. Calculate the cost of 5 pounds of feathers and 5 ounces of gold:**\n* Cost of 5 pounds of feathers: 5 * x = 5 * 2 = $10\n* Cost of 5 ounces of gold: 5 * y = 5 * 458 = $2290\n* Total cost: $10 + $2290 = $2300\n**Therefore, five pounds of feathers and five ounces of gold cost $2300.** \n",
