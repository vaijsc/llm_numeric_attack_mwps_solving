    "problem": "A ball is dropped from $405$ meters and rebounds two-thirds the distance it falls each time it bounces. How many meters will the ball have traveled when it hits the ground the fourth time?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We can split the ball's motion into two parts: when it goes down, and when it goes up. By adding these two parts together separately, we get two geometric series.\n\nWe will first calculate when the total distance that the ball falls. Initially, it falls $405$ meters. The next time, it will have rebounded $405(2/3)$ meters, so it will also fall that much. The next time, it will have rebounded $405(2/3)(2/3)$ meters, and so on. So, we have a finite geometric series with first term $405$ with common ratio $2/3.$ Since the ball falls four times before hitting the ground the fourth time, there are four terms in this series. The total distance that the ball falls is therefore $$\\frac{405\\left(1-\\left(\\frac23\\right)^4\\right)}{1-\\frac23} = 975.$$Now, we calculate the total distance that the ball rises. Initially, the ball rises $405(2/3)$ meters. The next time, it rises $405(2/3)(2/3)$ meters, and so on. This time, our geometric series has a first term of $405(2/3),$ common ratio $2/3,$ and three terms. Thus, the ball rises a total of $$\\frac{405\\cdot\\frac23\\left(1-\\left(\\frac23\\right)^3\\right)}{1-\\frac23} = 570.$$Adding together these two values, we find that the ball has traveled a total of $975 + 570 = \\boxed{1545}$ meters.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**Step 1: Calculate the distance of the first bounce**\n* The ball falls 405 meters initially.\n* It rebounds two-thirds of this distance: (2/3) * 405 meters = 270 meters\n**Step 2: Calculate the distance of the second bounce**\n* The ball falls 270 meters after the first bounce.\n* It rebounds two-thirds of this distance: (2/3) * 270 meters = 180 meters\n**Step 3: Calculate the distance of the third bounce**\n* The ball falls 180 meters after the second bounce.\n* It rebounds two-thirds of this distance: (2/3) * 180 meters = 120 meters\n**Step 4: Calculate the total distance traveled**\n* **Downward:** 405 meters + 270 meters + 180 meters + 120 meters = 975 meters\n* **Upward:** 270 meters + 180 meters + 120 meters = 570 meters\n* **Total:** 975 meters + 570 meters = **1545 meters**\n**Therefore, the ball will have traveled 1545 meters when it hits the ground the fourth time.** \n",
        "Here's how to break down the problem step by step:\n**1. First Bounce:**\n* The ball falls 405 meters.\n* It rebounds (2/3) * 405 = 270 meters.\n* **Total distance traveled:** 405 meters (down) + 270 meters (up) = 675 meters\n**2. Second Bounce:**\n* The ball falls 270 meters.\n* It rebounds (2/3) * 270 = 180 meters.\n* **Total distance traveled:** 675 meters (previous) + 270 meters (down) + 180 meters (up) = 1125 meters\n**3. Third Bounce:**\n* The ball falls 180 meters.\n* It rebounds (2/3) * 180 = 120 meters.\n* **Total distance traveled:** 1125 meters (previous) + 180 meters (down) + 120 meters (up) = 1425 meters\n**4. Fourth Bounce:**\n* The ball falls 120 meters.\n* **This is the moment we are asked about, so we don't need to calculate the rebound.**\n**Therefore, the ball will have traveled a total of 1425 meters + 120 meters = 1545 meters when it hits the ground for the fourth time.** \n",
