        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the conversion factor between lags and lugs:**\n* We know 9 lags = 20 lugs.\n* To find how many lugs are in one lag, divide both sides by 9: 1 lag = 20/9 lugs.\n**2. Find the conversion factor between ligs and lugs:**\n* We know 7 ligs = 4 lags.\n* Substitute the value of 1 lag in terms of lugs: 7 ligs = 4 * (20/9) lugs.\n* Simplify: 7 ligs = 80/9 lugs.\n* To find how many lugs are in one lig, divide both sides by 7: 1 lig = (80/9) / 7 lugs.\n* Simplify: 1 lig = 80/63 lugs.\n**3. Calculate the equivalent ligs for 80 lugs:**\n* We know 1 lig = 80/63 lugs.\n* To find how many ligs are in 80 lugs, divide both sides by (80/63): 80 lugs / (80/63) = 1 lig * (80/63) / (80/63)\n* Simplify: 80 lugs * (63/80) = 1 lig * 1\n* Therefore, 80 lugs = 63 ligs.\n**Answer:** 80 lugs are equivalent to **63 ligs**. \n",
