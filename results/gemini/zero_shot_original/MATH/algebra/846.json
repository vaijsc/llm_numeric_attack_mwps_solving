        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Concept**\nFor a system of linear equations to have infinitely many solutions, the equations must be dependent. This means one equation can be obtained by multiplying the other equation by a constant.\n**2. Manipulate the Equations**\nLet's try to make the coefficients of either *x* or *y* match in the two equations.  We can multiply the second equation by 3:\n```\n6x + 3y = 15 \n```\n**3. Compare Coefficients**\nNow we have the system:\n```\n3ax + 3y = 5b \n6x + 3y = 15\n```\nFor these equations to be dependent, the coefficients of *x* and *y* must be proportional.  This means:\n*  `3a = 6`  \n*  `5b = 15`\n**4. Solve for a and b**\nSolving these equations, we find:\n*  `a = 2`\n*  `b = 3`\n**Answer:**\nTherefore, the ordered pair $(a, b)$ that gives infinitely many solutions is **(2, 3)**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Problem**\nWe want to find values for *a* and *b* such that the two equations represent the same line. This means there are infinitely many points (x, y) that satisfy both equations.\n**2. Solve for One Variable**\nLet's solve the second equation for *y*:\n*  y = 5 - 2x\n**3. Substitute into the First Equation**\nSubstitute the expression for *y* into the first equation:\n* 3ax + 3(5 - 2x) = 5b\n**4. Simplify and Rearrange**\nSimplify and rearrange the equation to get it in the form of *ax + by = c*:\n* 3ax - 6x + 15 = 5b\n* (3a - 6)x = 5b - 15\n**5.  Conditions for Infinite Solutions**\nFor the two equations to represent the same line, the coefficients of *x* and the constant terms must be proportional.  This means:\n* **The coefficient of *x* in both equations must be the same (or both 0):** \n   * (3a - 6) = 0 \n* **The constant term in both equations must be the same:** \n   * 5b - 15 = 0 (Note: This is already the constant term from the rearranged first equation)\n**6. Solve for *a* and *b***\nSolve the equations from step 5:\n* 3a - 6 = 0  =>  3a = 6  =>  a = 2\n* 5b - 15 = 0  =>  5b = 15  =>  b = 3\n**Answer**\nTherefore, the ordered pair (a, b) that results in infinitely many solutions is **(2, 3)**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Problem**\nWe are given a system of two linear equations with two unknowns. We want to find the values of *a* and *b* for which the system has infinitely many solutions.\n**2. Recognize the Condition for Infinite Solutions**\nFor a system of linear equations to have infinitely many solutions, the equations must be **dependent**. This means one equation is a multiple of the other.\n**3. Make the Equations Dependent**\nTo make the equations dependent, we can try to manipulate the second equation so that it becomes a multiple of the first equation. \nLet's multiply the second equation by a constant, say *k*:\n```\nk(2x + y) = k(5) \n```\nThis gives us:\n```\n2kx + ky = 5k \n```\nNow, we want this equation to be the same as the first equation:\n```\n3ax + 3y = 5b \n```\n**4. Match Coefficients**\nFor the equations to be the same, the coefficients of *x* and *y* must match. This leads to two equations:\n*  2*k* = 3*a*\n*  *k* = 3\n**5. Solve for *a* and *b***\nFrom the second equation, we have *k* = 3. Substituting this into the first equation:\n* 2(3) = 3*a*\n*  6 = 3*a*\n*  a = 2\nNow, we need to find *b*.  Notice that the constant term in the first equation is 5*b*, and the constant term in the second equation, after multiplying by *k* (which is 3), is 5*k*.  \nSince these constants must match, we have:\n* 5*b* = 5*k*\n* 5*b* = 5(3)\n* b = 3\n**6. The Solution**\nTherefore, the ordered pair (a, b) for which the system has infinitely many solutions is **(2, 3)**. \n",

Understand the concept of infinitely many solutions.**\nFor a system of linear equations to have infinitely many solutions, the two equations must represent the same line. This means they must be multiples of each other. \n**2.  Manipulate the equations to make them easier to compare.**\nWe can multiply the second equation by 3:\n  \n  *  $6x + 3y = 15$\n**3.  Compare the coefficients.**\nNow, we need to find values for  'a' and 'b' that make the coefficients of the first equation a multiple of the coefficients of the second equation.  Looking at the coefficients of 'y', we already see that they match: 3y in both equations.\nTo make the 'x' coefficients match, we need  $3a = 6$.  Solving for 'a', we get:\n*  $a = 2$\nNow, to make the constant terms match, we need $5b = 15$. Solving for 'b', we get:\n* $b = 3$\n**4.  Check our solution.**\nLet's substitute  $a = 2$ and $b = 3$ back into the original system of equations:\n*  $6x + 3y = 15$\n*  $2x + y = 5$\nThese equations are clearly multiples of each other, confirming that they represent the same line.\n**Answer:**\nThe ordered pair $(a,b)$ that results in infinitely many solutions is **(2, 3)**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step by step:\n**1. Eliminate one variable**\nWe can use elimination to get rid of one of the variables.  Multiply the second equation by -3:\n```\n-6x - 3y = -15 \n```\nNow add this equation to the first equation:\n```\n3ax + 3y = 5b\n-6x - 3y = -15\n------------------\n3ax - 6x = 5b - 15\n```\n**2. Simplify and analyze**\nSimplify the equation:\n```\n(3a - 6)x = 5b - 15\n```\nFor this equation to have infinitely many solutions, the coefficients of *x* must both be zero.  This is because if the coefficients are non-zero, we can solve for a unique value of *x*.\n**3. Set up equations**\nThis gives us two equations:\n*  3a - 6 = 0\n*  5b - 15 = 0\n**4. Solve for a and b**\nSolve for *a* and *b*:\n*  3a = 6  =>  a = 2\n*  5b = 15  =>  b = 3\n**Answer**\nTherefore, the ordered pair (a, b) is **(2, 3)**. \n"
