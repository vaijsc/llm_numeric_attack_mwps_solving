    "solution": "Let $a$ denote the number of chocolate candies, $b$ the number of vanilla, $c$ the number of peppermint, and $d$ the number of lemon. We can represent the information given in the problem with the following system of linear equations:\n\\begin{align*}\na+b+c+d &= 15 \\\\\n2(a+b) &= c+d \\\\\nc-8 &= d\n\\end{align*} Substituting for $c+d$ in terms of $a+b$ into the first equation gives $3a + 3b = 15$, or $a + b = 5$. This means that $c + d = 10$. The third equation can also be expressed as $c - d = 8$. Adding these two equations gives $2c = 18$, so $c = 9$. Because $d = c - 8$, $d = \\boxed{1}$.",

Define variables:**\n* Let  'c' represent the number of chocolate candies.\n* Let 'v' represent the number of vanilla candies.\n* Let 'p' represent the number of peppermint candies.\n* Let 'l' represent the number of lemon candies.\n**2. Set up equations based on the given information:**\n* **Equation 1:** c + v + p + l = 15  (Total candies)\n* **Equation 2:** p + l = 2(c + v)  (Peppermint and lemon candies are twice the number of chocolate and vanilla candies)\n* **Equation 3:** p = l + 8  (Peppermint candies are 8 more than lemon candies)\n**3. Solve the system of equations:**\n* **Substitute Equation 3 into Equation 2:** (l + 8) + l = 2(c + v)\n* **Simplify Equation 2:** 2l + 8 = 2(c + v) \n* **Substitute Equation 2 (simplified) into Equation 1:** c + v + (2l + 8) + l = 15\n* **Simplify Equation 1:** c + v + 3l + 8 = 15\n* **Combine like terms:** c + v + 3l = 7\n**4.  Now we have two equations with four unknowns:**\n*  c + v + 3l = 7\n*  2l + 8 = 2(c + v) \n**5.  We need to find a way to eliminate some variables.  Let's solve the second equation for 2(c+v):**\n*  2(c+v) = 2l + 8\n**6.  Substitute this value into the first equation:**\n* c + v + 3l = 7\n* (2l + 8)/2 + 3l = 7\n**7.  Simplify and solve for 'l':**\n* l + 4 + 3l = 7\n* 4l = 3\n* l = 3/4 \n**Since you can't have a fraction of a candy, there must be an error in the problem statement. It's likely impossible to have these conditions with a whole number of candies.** \n",
