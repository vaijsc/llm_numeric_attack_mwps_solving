        "Here's how to solve this problem step by step:\n**1. Understanding the Problem:**\n* We have a set of six numbers: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n* We need to find all possible two-element subsets (groups of two).\n* For each subset, we need to calculate the sum of its elements.\n* Finally, we need to find the sum of all these individual sums.\n**2. Finding the Subsets:**\nThere are 15 possible two-element subsets, as you've stated. Here they are:\n* {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {1, 4}, {1, 5}, {1, 6}\n* {2, 3}, {2, 4}, {2, 5}, {2, 6}\n* {3, 4}, {3, 5}, {3, 6}\n* {4, 5}, {4, 6}\n* {5, 6}\n**3. Calculating the Sums:**\nNow, let's calculate the sum of each subset:\n* {1, 2} : 1 + 2 = 3\n* {1, 3} : 1 + 3 = 4\n* {1, 4} : 1 + 4 = 5\n* {1, 5} : 1 + 5 = 6\n* {1, 6} : 1 + 6 = 7\n* {2, 3} : 2 + 3 = 5\n* {2, 4} : 2 + 4 = 6\n* {2, 5} : 2 + 5 = 7\n* {2, 6} : 2 + 6 = 8\n* {3, 4} : 3 + 4 = 7\n* {3, 5} : 3 + 5 = 8\n* {3, 6} : 3 + 6 = 9\n* {4, 5} : 4 + 5 = 9\n* {4, 6} : 4 + 6 = 10\n* {5, 6} : 5 + 6 = 11\n**4. Finding the Total Sum:**\nFinally, we add up all the individual sums:\n3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 9 + 10 + 11 = **90**\n**Therefore, the sum of the sums of all 15 two-element subsets of {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} is 90.** \n",

This means each number contributes 5 times its value to the final sum. Therefore, the total sum is 5 * (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6) = 5 * 21 = **90**. \n",
