    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We use the distance formula: $\\sqrt{(-4 - 1)^2 + (1 - 13)^2},$ which is $\\sqrt{25 + 144} = \\sqrt{169} = \\boxed{13}$.\n\n- OR -\n\nWe note that the points $(-4,1)$, $(1,13)$, and $(1,1)$ form a right triangle with legs of length 5 and 12. $(5,12,13)$ is a Pythagorean triple, so the hypotenuse has length $\\boxed{13}$.",

        "Here's how to find the length of the segment:\n**1. Understand the Concept:**\n* The length of a segment is the distance between its endpoints.\n* Since the endpoints have the same y-coordinate (both have a y-coordinate of 1), this segment is a horizontal line.\n**2. Calculate the Distance:**\n* The segment stretches from x = -4 to x = 1.\n* The distance between these x-values is 1 - (-4) = 5 units.\n**Answer:** The segment is **5 units** long. \n",
