        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Set up equations:**\n* Let 'x' represent the larger number.\n* Let 'y' represent the smaller number.\nWe know the following:\n*  x + y = 25  (The sum of the two numbers is 25)\n*  x - y = 11  (The difference of the two numbers is 11)\n**2. Solve for one variable:**\n* Add the two equations together: \n   (x + y) + (x - y) = 25 + 11\n* This simplifies to: 2x = 36\n* Divide both sides by 2: x = 18\n**3. Substitute to find the other variable:**\n* Substitute the value of x (18) into either of the original equations. Let's use the first one:\n   18 + y = 25\n* Subtract 18 from both sides: y = 7\n**4. Answer:**\n* The smaller of the two numbers is **7**. \n",
