    "solution": "The common difference in this arithmetic sequence is $987 - 1000= -13$, so the $n^{\\text{th}}$ term in this sequence is $1000 - 13(n - 1) = 1013 - 13n$.  This expression is positive if and only if $1013 - 13n > 0$, or \\[n < \\frac{1013}{13} = 77 + \\frac{12}{13}.\\] Since $n$ must be a positive integer, $n \\le 77$.  Hence, the least positive integer in this sequence corresponds to the value $n = 77$, in which case $1013 - 13n = 1013 - 13 \\cdot 77 = \\boxed{12}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n1. **Identify the pattern:**  Notice that each term is 13 less than the previous term. This means the common difference of the arithmetic sequence is -13.\n2. **General form:** The general form of an arithmetic sequence is:  \n   *  a<sub>n</sub> = a<sub>1</sub> + (n - 1)d\n   where:\n     * a<sub>n</sub> is the nth term\n     * a<sub>1</sub> is the first term\n     * d is the common difference\n     * n is the term number\n3. **Apply the pattern:** We know a<sub>1</sub> = 1000 and d = -13.  We want to find the smallest positive term, so we need to find the smallest value of 'n' that makes a<sub>n</sub> positive.\n4. **Set up an inequality:**  We want to find the smallest 'n' such that:\n   *  1000 + (n - 1)(-13) > 0 \n5. **Solve the inequality:**\n   *  1000 - 13n + 13 > 0\n   *  1013 - 13n > 0\n   *  13n < 1013\n   *  n < 78 \n6. **Interpret the result:** This means the first 77 terms of the sequence will be positive.  To find the least positive integer in the sequence, we need to find the 78th term:\n   *  a<sub>78</sub> = 1000 + (78 - 1)(-13) = 1000 - 989 = 11\n**Therefore, the least positive integer in the sequence is 11.** \n",
