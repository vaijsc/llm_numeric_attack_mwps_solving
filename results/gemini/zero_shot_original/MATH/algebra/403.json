        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n1. **Expand both sides of the equation:**\n   *  $(4x+11)(2x-8) = 8x^2 - 19x - 88$\n   *  $x(2x+7) = 2x^2 + 7x$\n2. **Set the equations equal to each other and simplify:**\n   *  $8x^2 - 19x - 88 = 2x^2 + 7x$\n   *  $6x^2 - 26x - 88 = 0$\n3. **Divide both sides by 2 to simplify further:**\n   *  $3x^2 - 13x - 44 = 0$\n4. **Factor the quadratic equation:**\n   *  $(3x + 11)(x - 4) = 0$\n5. **Solve for x:**\n   *  $3x + 11 = 0$  or  $x - 4 = 0$\n   *  $x = -\\frac{11}{3}$  or  $x = 4$\n6. **Identify the larger value:**\n   *  The larger value of  $x$ is $\\boxed{4}$. \n",
        "1. **Expand both sides of the equation:** \n   \n   The left side expands to: $(4x+11)(2x-8) = 8x^2 - 15x - 88$\n   \n   The right side expands to: $x(2x+7) = 2x^2 + 7x$\n2. **Set the equation to zero:**\n   Subtract $2x^2 + 7x$ from both sides to get: $6x^2 - 22x - 88 = 0$\n3. **Simplify the equation:**\n   Divide both sides by 2 to get: $3x^2 - 11x - 44 = 0$\n4. **Solve for x:**\n   We can solve this quadratic equation by factoring or using the quadratic formula. Let's use factoring:\n   * Find two numbers that multiply to give (3)(-44) = -132 and add up to -11.  These numbers are -22 and 6. \n   * Rewrite the middle term:  $3x^2 - 22x + 6x - 44 = 0$\n   * Factor by grouping: $x(3x-22) + 2(3x-22) = 0$\n   * Factor out the common term: $(3x-22)(x+2) = 0$\n   * Set each factor equal to zero and solve:\n      *  $3x - 22 = 0  \\Rightarrow x = \\frac{22}{3}$\n      *  $x + 2 = 0  \\Rightarrow x = -2$\n5. **Identify the largest value:**\n   The largest value of $x$ that satisfies the equation is $\\boxed{\\frac{22}{3}}$. \n",
