        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Problem**\nImagine the parabola opening upwards and shifted 5 units down. The origin (0,0) is below the parabola. We want to find the shortest distance from the origin to a point on the parabola.\n**2. Use the Distance Formula**\nThe distance between the origin (0,0) and a point (x, y) on the parabola is:\n```\nDistance = \u221a((x - 0)\u00b2 + (y - 0)\u00b2) = \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)\n```\n**3. Substitute the Parabola's Equation**\nSince the point lies on the parabola, we know y = x\u00b2 - 5.  Substitute this into the distance formula:\n```\nDistance = \u221a(x\u00b2 + (x\u00b2 - 5)\u00b2) = \u221a(2x\u2074 - 10x\u00b2 + 25)\n```\n**4. Minimize the Distance**\nTo find the shortest distance, we need to minimize the expression under the square root. Let's call this expression f(x):\n```\nf(x) = 2x\u2074 - 10x\u00b2 + 25 \n```\nWe can find the minimum by taking the derivative and setting it equal to zero:\n```\nf'(x) = 8x\u00b3 - 20x = 0\n```\nFactor out 4x:\n```\n4x(2x\u00b2 - 5) = 0\n```\nThis gives us solutions x = 0 and x\u00b2 = 5/2.  Since the parabola is symmetrical, the minimum distance will occur at x = \u221a(5/2).\n**5. Calculate the Minimum Distance**\nSubstitute x = \u221a(5/2) back into the distance formula:\n```\nDistance = \u221a(2(\u221a(5/2))\u2074 - 10(\u221a(5/2))\u00b2 + 25) = \u221a(25/2) = \u221a25 / \u221a2 = 5/\u221a2\n```\n**6. Rationalize the Denominator**\nTo get the distance in the form \u221aa / b, rationalize the denominator:\n```\nDistance = (5/\u221a2) * (\u221a2/\u221a2) = 5\u221a2 / 2\n```\n**7. Find a + b**\nWe have the distance in the form \u221aa / b, where a = 2 and b = 2.  Therefore:\n```\na + b = 2 + 2 = 4\n```\n**Answer:** The smallest distance between the origin and a point on the parabola can be expressed as \u221a2/2, and a + b = **4**. \n",
        "**1. Visualize the Problem**\nImagine the parabola $y = x^2 - 5$ and the origin (0, 0).  We want to find the shortest distance between these two points.  This shortest distance will occur along a line perpendicular to the parabola at the point where the line intersects the parabola.\n**2. Use Calculus**\n* **Distance Formula:** The distance between a point on the parabola $(x, x^2 - 5)$ and the origin is given by:\n   ```\n   d = sqrt(x^2 + (x^2 - 5)^2)\n   ```\n* **Minimize Distance:** To find the shortest distance, we need to minimize the distance function, `d`.  We can do this using calculus:\n   1. Find the derivative of `d` with respect to `x`.\n   2. Set the derivative equal to zero and solve for `x`.\n   3. Verify that the critical point corresponds to a minimum.\n**3. Calculate the Derivative**\nIt's easier to work with the square of the distance (`d^2`) to avoid dealing with the square root:\n```\nd^2 = x^2 + (x^2 - 5)^2\n```\nNow, take the derivative:\n```\nd^2/dx = 2x + 2(x^2 - 5)(2x) = 4x^3 - 18x \n```\n**4. Find Critical Points**\nSet the derivative equal to zero and solve for `x`:\n```\n4x^3 - 18x = 0\n2x(2x^2 - 9) = 0\n```\nThis gives us solutions `x = 0` and `x = \u00b13/\u221a2`.\n**5. Verify Minimum**\nWe can use the second derivative test to verify that the critical point `x = 3/\u221a2` corresponds to a minimum.  The second derivative is `12x^2 - 18`.  Evaluating this at `x = 3/\u221a2` gives a positive value, indicating a minimum.\n**6. Find the Distance**\nSubstitute `x = 3/\u221a2` back into the original distance formula:\n```\nd = sqrt((3/\u221a2)^2 + ((3/\u221a2)^2 - 5)^2) = sqrt(9/2 + 1/2) = sqrt(5)\n```\n**7. Express the Answer**\nThe shortest distance is `sqrt(5)/1`. Therefore, `a + b = 5 + 1 = **6**`. \n",

We can use the second derivative test:\n*D'' = 12x^2 - 18*\nEvaluating at each critical point:\n*D''(0) = -18* (negative, indicating a maximum)\n*D''(\u221a(9/2)) = 18* (positive, indicating a minimum)\n*D''(-\u221a(9/2)) = 18* (positive, indicating a minimum)\nSince x = \u00b1\u221a(9/2) give us minima, we can plug either value into our original distance formula. Let's use x = \u221a(9/2):\nDistance = $\\sqrt{(\u221a(9/2))^2 + ((\u221a(9/2))^2 - 5)^2}$\nSimplify:\nDistance = $\\sqrt{9/2 + (9/2 - 5)^2}$\nDistance = $\\sqrt{9/2 + 1/4}$\nDistance = $\\sqrt{19/4}$\n**5. Express in the Desired Form**\nThe smallest distance is $\\sqrt{19/4}$, which simplifies to $\\sqrt{19}/2$.\n**6. Find a + b**\nTherefore, a + b = 19 + 2 = **21**. \n",

        "Here's a step-by-step solution:\n**1. Understand the Problem:**\nWe want to find the shortest distance between the origin (0, 0) and any point on the parabola  y = x\u00b2 - 5.  This shortest distance will be the perpendicular distance from the origin to the parabola.\n**2. Visualize:**\nSketch the parabola y = x\u00b2 - 5. You'll see that the shortest distance will occur where a line segment from the origin is perpendicular to the parabola.\n**3. Use Calculus:**\n* **Distance Formula:** The distance between the origin (0, 0) and a point (x, y) on the parabola is  \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). \n* **Substitute:** Since y = x\u00b2 - 5, the distance formula becomes  \u221a(x\u00b2 + (x\u00b2 - 5)\u00b2).\n* **Minimize:** We want to minimize this distance. To do that, we'll find the critical points of the distance function:\n   * Let D(x) = \u221a(x\u00b2 + (x\u00b2 - 5)\u00b2)\n   * Find D'(x) (the derivative of D(x)) using the chain rule.\n   * Set D'(x) = 0 and solve for x. This will give us the x-coordinate of the point on the parabola where the distance is minimized.\n**4. Calculate the Derivative and Solve:**\n* D'(x) = (1/2)(x\u00b2 + (x\u00b2 - 5)\u00b2)\u207b\u00b9/\u00b2 * (2x + 2(x\u00b2 - 5)(2x))\n* Simplifying D'(x), we get: D'(x) = (5x(x\u00b2 - 2))/\u221a(x\u00b2 + (x\u00b2 - 5)\u00b2)\n* Setting D'(x) = 0, we have 5x(x\u00b2 - 2) = 0.  This gives us solutions x = 0 and x = \u00b1\u221a2.\n**5. Determine the Minimum:**\nWe need to check which of these points actually minimizes the distance. \n* **x = 0:** This point is on the parabola, but the distance from the origin is simply 5.\n* **x = \u221a2:** This point leads to a shorter distance than x = 0.\n* **x = -\u221a2:** This point will also lead to the same minimum distance as x = \u221a2 due to the symmetry of the parabola.\n**6. Find the Minimum Distance:**\n* Substitute x = \u221a2 into the distance formula:  \u221a(\u221a2\u00b2 + (\u221a2\u00b2 - 5)\u00b2) = \u221a(2 + (-3)\u00b2) = \u221a11\n* The shortest distance is \u221a11.\n**7.
