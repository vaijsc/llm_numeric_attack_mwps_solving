    "solution": "We have two equations and two variables, so it's possible to solve for $m$ and $n$ directly and then calculate $|m-n|$. However, doing so is messy, so we look for an alternative approach. We square the second equation to get $(m+n)^2 = m^2 + 2mn +n^2 = 64$. We know that $mn=7$, so we can subtract the equation $4mn=28$ to get that $m^2 -2mn + n^2 = (m-n)^2 = 36$. This gives us that $m-n=\\pm 6$ so $|m-n|=\\boxed{6}$.",

Recognize the Relationship**\nWe have two equations: \n*  *mn = 7*  (This tells us *m* and *n* are factors of 7)\n*  *m + n = 8* (This tells us *m* and *n* add up to 8)\n**2. Find the Factors**\nThe only factors of 7 are 1 and 7.  Since *m* and *n* must be factors of 7, we have two possibilities:\n*  *m = 1* and *n = 7*\n*  *m = 7* and *n = 1*\n**3.
