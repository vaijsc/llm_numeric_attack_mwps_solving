        "To maximize the value of the expression, we want to make the first factor as large as possible and the second factor as small as possible.\n* **Maximizing the first factor:**  We want $a$ to be as large as possible (which is $-2$) and $b$ to be as small as possible (which is 3). This gives us  \n   $a + \\frac{1}{b} = -2 + \\frac{1}{3} = -\\frac{5}{3}$.\n* **Minimizing the second factor:**  We want $a$ to be as small as possible (which is $-6$) and $b$ to be as large as possible (which is 5). This gives us \n   $\\frac{1}{b} - a = \\frac{1}{5} + 6 = \\frac{31}{5}$.\nTherefore, the greatest possible value of the expression is \n\\[\\left(-\\frac{5}{3}\\right) \\left(\\frac{31}{5}\\right) = \\boxed{-\\frac{31}{3}}.\\]",

Analyze the Expression**\nNotice that the expression looks like a difference of squares: \n  \n  (a + 1/b)(1/b - a) = (1/b)\u00b2 - a\u00b2\n**3. Maximize the Expression**\n* **Maximize (1/b)\u00b2:** To make (1/b)\u00b2 as large as possible, we want *b* to be as small as possible.  Since 3 \u2264 b \u2264 5, the smallest possible value of *b* is 3. \n* **Minimize a\u00b2:** To make a\u00b2 as small as possible, we want *a* to be as close to zero as possible. Since -6 \u2264 a \u2264 -2, the value of *a* closest to zero is -2.\n**4. Substitute and Calculate**\nSubstituting *b = 3* and *a = -2* into the expression, we get:\n(1/3)\u00b2 - (-2)\u00b2 = 1/9 - 4 = -35/9\n**Answer:** The greatest possible value of the expression is **-35/9**. \n",
        "### Response:\nWe can expand the given expression:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\left(a+\\frac{1}{b}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{b}-a\\right) &= \\frac{1}{b^2} - a^2 \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{b^2} + (-a^2)\n\\end{align*}\nTo maximize this expression, we want to maximize $\\frac{1}{b^2}$ and minimize $-a^2$.  Since $b$ is positive, $\\frac{1}{b^2}$ is maximized when $b$ is minimized, which happens when $b=3$.  Since $a$ is negative, $-a^2$ is minimized when $a$ is minimized, which happens when $a=-2$.  \nTherefore, the greatest possible value of the expression is\n\\[\\frac{1}{3^2} + (-(-2)^2) = \\boxed{-\\frac{35}{9}}.\\]",

Understanding the Problem**\nWe want to find the greatest possible value of the expression  \n  \n$\\left(a+\\frac{1}{b}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{b}-a\\right)$.\nThis expression looks like a difference of squares:  $(x+y)(x-y) = x^2 - y^2$.

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Problem:**\nWe're given ranges for *a* and *b* and asked to find the greatest possible value of the expression. To do this, we need to think about how the choices of *a* and *b* affect the expression.\n**2. Analyze the Expression:**\n* The expression is the product of two factors:  (a + 1/b) and (1/b - a).\n* Notice that the two factors are very similar, except for the sign in the middle. This suggests we might be able to use a helpful algebraic pattern.\n**3. Use a Pattern:**\nRecall the difference of squares pattern:  (x + y)(x - y) = x\u00b2 - y\u00b2\nWe can apply this pattern to our expression:\n(a + 1/b)(1/b - a) = (1/b)\u00b2 - a\u00b2 \n**4.

The smallest possible value for *b* is 3.\n* **Minimizing a\u00b2:** To minimize a\u00b2, we need to minimize *a*. The smallest possible value for *a* is -6.\n**5. Calculate the Maximum Value:**\nSubstitute the smallest values for *a* and *b* into the simplified expression:\n(1/3)\u00b2 - (-6)\u00b2 = 1/9 - 36 = -323/9\n**Answer:** The greatest possible value of the expression is **-323/9**. \n"
