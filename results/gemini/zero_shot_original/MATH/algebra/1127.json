        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Problem**\nWe want to find the shortest distance between the origin (0, 0) and a point on the parabola defined by the equation  \n  *  *y* = (1/\u221a2)(*x*\u00b2 - 3) \n**2. Distance Formula**\nThe distance between two points ( *x*\u2081, *y*\u2081) and (*x*\u2082, *y*\u2082) is given by:\n  *  \u221a(( *x*\u2082 - *x*\u2081)\u00b2 + (*y*\u2082 - *y*\u2081)\u00b2 )\nIn our case, we want the distance between (0, 0) and a point (*x*, (1/\u221a2)(*x*\u00b2 - 3)) on the parabola.  Let's call this distance *d*:\n  *  *d* = \u221a((*x* - 0)\u00b2 + ((1/\u221a2)(*x*\u00b2 - 3) - 0)\u00b2)\n  *  *d* = \u221a(*x*\u00b2 + (1/2)(*x*\u2074 - 6*x*\u00b2 + 9))\n  *  *d* = \u221a((1/2)*x*\u2074 - 2*x*\u00b2 + 9/2)\n**3. Minimize the Distance**\nTo find the shortest distance, we need to minimize the expression for *d*.  Since the square root function is increasing, minimizing *d*\u00b2 will also minimize *d*.  Let's work with *d*\u00b2:\n  *  *d*\u00b2 = (1/2)*x*\u2074 - 2*x*\u00b2 + 9/2\nNow we have a function of *x*.  We can find its minimum by taking the derivative and setting it equal to zero:\n  *  d(*d*\u00b2)/d*x* = 2*x*\u00b3 - 4*x* = 0\n  *  2*x*( *x*\u00b2 - 2) = 0\nThis gives us solutions *x* = 0 and *x* = \u00b1\u221a2.\n**4. Check for Minimum**\nTo make sure we've found a minimum, we can use the second derivative test:\n  *  d\u00b2(*d*\u00b2)/d*x*\u00b2 = 6*x*\u00b2 - 4\n  *  At *x* = 0, the second derivative is negative, indicating a maximum.\n  *  At *x* = \u00b1\u221a2, the second derivative is positive, indicating a minimum.\nTherefore, the minimum distance occurs at *x* = \u00b1\u221a2.\n**5. Calculate the Minimum Distance**\nLet's plug *x* = \u221a2 (or *x* = -\u221a2, since the distance will be the same) back into the original distance formula:\n  *  *d* = \u221a((1/2)(\u221a2)\u2074 - 2(\u221a2)\u00b2 + 9/2) \n  *  *d* = \u221a(2 - 4 + 9/2)\n  *  *d* = \u221a(5/2)\n**6. Simplify and Find the Answer**\nThe minimum distance can be expressed as \u221a(5/2).  To get it in the form \u221a*a*/ *b*, we can rationalize the denominator:\n  *  *d* = \u221a(5/2) * \u221a(2/2) = \u221a10/2\nTherefore, *a* = 10 and *b* = 2, and *a* + *b* = 10 + 2 = **12**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Problem**\nWe want to find the shortest distance from the origin (0,0) to any point on the curve defined by the equation  $y=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(x^2-3\\right)$.  This shortest distance is represented by the perpendicular line segment from the origin to the curve.\n**2. Distance Formula**\nThe distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by:\n\u221a((x\u2082 - x\u2081)\u00b2 + (y\u2082 - y\u2081)\u00b2 )\n**3. Minimize the Distance**\nLet's consider a point $(x, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3))$ on the curve.  The distance from this point to the origin is:\n\u221a(x\u00b2 + (1/\u221a2)(x\u00b2 - 3)\u00b2) \nTo minimize this distance, we can minimize the square of the distance:\nd\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + (1/2)(x\u2074 - 6x\u00b2 + 9) = (1/2)x\u2074 - 2x\u00b2 + 9/2\n**4. Calculus to the Rescue**\nTo find the minimum value of d\u00b2, we take its derivative and set it equal to zero:\nd\u00b2/dx = 2x\u00b3 - 4x = 0\nThis factors as 2x(x\u00b2 - 2) = 0.  The solutions are x = 0 and x = \u00b1\u221a2.\n**5. Check for Minimum**\nWe need to verify that these critical points correspond to a minimum. We can use the second derivative test:\nd\u2074/dx\u00b2 = 6x\u00b2 - 4\nAt x = 0, the second derivative is negative, indicating a maximum.  At x = \u00b1\u221a2, the second derivative is positive, indicating a minimum.\n**6. Calculate the Minimum Distance**\nSince the minimum occurs at x = \u00b1\u221a2, we can plug this back into the original distance formula:\nd = \u221a((\u221a2)\u00b2 + (1/\u221a2)((\u221a2)\u00b2 - 3)\u00b2) = \u221a(2 + 1/2) = \u221a(5/2)\n**7. Express in the Desired Form**\nThe smallest distance is \u221a(5/2), which can be written as \u221a5 / \u221a2.  To rationalize the denominator, we multiply by \u221a2/\u221a2:\n\u221a5 / \u221a2 * \u221a2/\u221a2 = \u221a10 / 2\n**8. Find a + b**\nTherefore, a + b = 10 + 2 = **12**. \n",

This shortest distance is the minimum value of the distance between a point on the curve and the origin.\n**2. Distance Formula**\nThe distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by:\n$$d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$$\nIn our case, one point is the origin (0, 0), and the other point lies on the curve and has coordinates $(x, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3))$.  Therefore, the distance between them is:\n$$d = \\sqrt{(x - 0)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) - 0\\right)^2}$$\n**3. Minimize the Distance**\nTo find the minimum distance, we need to minimize the expression for  'd'.  It's easier to work with the square of the distance, which we'll call 'D':\n$$D = d^2 = x^2 + \\frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2$$\nWe can find the minimum of 'D' by taking its derivative and setting it equal to zero:\n$$\\frac{dD}{dx} = 2x + (x^2 - 3)x = 0$$\nSimplifying, we get:\n$$x(x^2 + 2x - 3) = 0$$\nFactoring the quadratic, we get:\n$$x(x + 3)(x - 1) = 0$$\nThis gives us three possible solutions for x: x = 0, x = -3, and x = 1.\n**4.  Test the Critical Points**\nTo determine which of these values gives the minimum distance, we can use the second derivative test.  We find the second derivative of D:\n$$\\frac{d^2D}{dx^2} = 2 + 3x^2 - 6 = 3x^2 - 4$$\nEvaluating the second derivative at each of the critical points:\n*  x = 0:   3(0)^2 - 4 = -4 (negative, so this is a local maximum)\n*  x = -3: 3(-3)^2 - 4 = 23 (positive, so this is a local minimum)\n*  x = 1:   3(1)^2 - 4 = -1 (negative, so this is a local maximum)\nTherefore, the minimum distance occurs at x = -3.\n**5. Calculate the Minimum Distance**\nSubstitute x = -3 back into the original equation for 'd':\n$$d = \\sqrt{(-3)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}((-3)^2 - 3)^2} = \\sqrt{9 + \\frac{1}{2}(6)^2} = \\sqrt{9 + 18} = \\sqrt{27}$$\n**6. Simplify the Answer**\nWe can simplify $\\sqrt{27}$ as $\\sqrt{9 \\cdot 3} = 3\\sqrt{3}$.  Therefore, the minimum distance is  $\\sqrt{3}/1$.\n**7. Find a + b**\nFinally,  a + b = 3 + 1 = **4**. \n",

Visualize the Problem**\nImagine the parabola and the origin.  The shortest distance will be along a line that is perpendicular to the parabola at the point of intersection.\n**3. Use Calculus**\n* **Distance Formula:** The distance between a point (x,y) on the parabola and the origin is given by:  \n   $D = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$\n* **Substitute:** Since the point (x,y) lies on the parabola, we can substitute  $y = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)$ into the distance formula:\n   $D = \\sqrt{x^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\\right)^2}$\n* **Minimize Distance:** To find the shortest distance, we need to minimize the function D.  We can do this by taking the derivative, setting it equal to zero, and solving for x.\n**4.

Calculate the Minimum Distance**\nPlug $x = \\sqrt{\\frac{5}{2}}$ into the distance formula:\n$D = \\sqrt{\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{5}{2}}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{5}{2}}\\right)^2 - 3\\right)\\right)^2}$\n$D = \\sqrt{\\frac{5}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{21}{8}}$\n**8.

        "Here's a step-by-step solution to find the smallest distance:\n**1. Understand the Problem**\nWe need to find the shortest distance between the origin (0,0) and any point on the curve  y = (1/\u221a2)(x\u00b2 - 3).  This is a minimization problem.\n**2.

Express Distance as a Function**\nLet's express the distance, 'd', as a function of 'x':\nd(x) = \u221a[(x - 0)\u00b2 + ((1/\u221a2)(x\u00b2 - 3) - 0)\u00b2]\nd(x) = \u221a[x\u00b2 + (1/2)(x\u2074 - 6x\u00b2 + 9)]\nd(x) = \u221a[(1/2)x\u2074 - 2x\u00b2 + 9]\n**4. Minimize the Distance**\nTo find the minimum distance, we need to find the minimum value of d(x).  A common approach is to use calculus:\n* **Find the derivative:** d'(x) = (1/2) * (1/\u221a[(1/2)x\u2074 - 2x\u00b2 + 9]) * (2x\u00b3 - 4x)\n* **Set the derivative to zero:**  d'(x) = 0.

We can use the second derivative test:\n    * d''(x) = (1/2) * [(1/\u221a[(1/2)x\u2074 - 2x\u00b2 + 9]) * (6x\u00b2 - 4) - (2x\u00b3 - 4x)\u00b2 * (1/4) * (1/[(1/2)x\u2074 - 2x\u00b2 + 9])^(3/2)]\n    * Evaluate d''(x) at x = 0 and x = \u00b1\u221a2. We find that d''(0) > 0 and d''(\u00b1\u221a2) > 0, indicating a minimum at these points.\n**5. Calculate the Minimum Distance**\nSince we have a minimum at x = 0 and x = \u00b1\u221a2, let's calculate the distance at these points:\n* d(0) = \u221a9 = 3\n* d(\u221a2) = d(-\u221a2) = \u221a[(1/2)(\u221a2)\u2074 - 2(\u221a2)\u00b2 + 9] = \u221a5\n**6.
