        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n1. **Rewrite the equation in slope-intercept form (y = mx + b):**\n   * Start with the given equation:  (x/4) - (y/5) = 1\n   * Subtract (x/4) from both sides:  -(y/5) = 1 - (x/4)\n   * Multiply both sides by -5: y = 5 - (5/4)x\n   * Rearrange: y = (-5/4)x + 5\n2. **Identify the slope of the original line:**\n   * The equation is now in slope-intercept form (y = mx + b). The coefficient of the x term is the slope.\n   * The slope of the original line is -5/4.\n3. **Find the slope of the perpendicular line:**\n   * Perpendicular lines have slopes that are negative reciprocals of each other. \n   * To find the negative reciprocal, flip the fraction and change the sign. \n   * The negative reciprocal of -5/4 is 4/5.\n**Therefore, the slope of the line perpendicular to the given line is 4/5.** \n",
