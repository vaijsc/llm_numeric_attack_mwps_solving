        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand Absolute Value**\nThe absolute value of a number is its distance from zero.  For example, |3| = 3 and |-3| = 3.\n**2. Solve the Equation**\nWe have the equation: |2 - |x|| = 1\n* **Case 1:** 2 - |x| \u2265 0 \n   In this case, the absolute value doesn't change the sign.  So we have:\n   2 - |x| = 1\n   |x| = 1\n   This gives us two solutions: x = 1 and x = -1.\n* **Case 2:** 2 - |x| < 0\n   In this case, the absolute value changes the sign. So we have:\n   -(2 - |x|) = 1\n   |x| = 3\n   This gives us two solutions: x = 3 and x = -3.\n**3. Find the Squares and Sum**\nWe found four solutions: 1, -1, 3, and -3.  Let's square each of them:\n* 1\u00b2 = 1\n* (-1)\u00b2 = 1\n* 3\u00b2 = 9\n* (-3)\u00b2 = 9\nFinally, sum the squares: 1 + 1 + 9 + 9 = **20**\n**Therefore, the sum of the squares of all real values of *x* for which |2 - |x|| = 1 is 20.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Absolute Value**\nThe equation  $|2-|x|| = 1$ involves two absolute values.  Let's break it down:\n* **Inner Absolute Value:**  The expression  $|x|$ represents the distance of *x* from zero on the number line. \n* **Outer Absolute Value:** The expression $|2-|x||$ represents the distance of  (2 - |x|) from zero on the number line.\n**2. Solve for Possible Cases**\nSince we have an absolute value, we need to consider two cases:\n**Case 1: 2 - |x| \u2265 0**\nIf 2 - |x| is non-negative, then  |2 - |x|| = 2 - |x|.  We can solve the equation:\n2 - |x| = 1\n|x| = 1\nThis gives us two solutions: x = 1 and x = -1.\n**Case 2: 2 - |x| < 0**\nIf 2 - |x| is negative, then |2 - |x|| = -(2 - |x|) = |x| - 2.  We solve:\n|x| - 2 = 1\n|x| = 3\nThis gives us two more solutions: x = 3 and x = -3.\n**3. Find the Sum of Squares**\nWe found four possible values for *x*: 1, -1, 3, and -3.  We need to square each of these and sum them:\n1\u00b2 + (-1)\u00b2 + 3\u00b2 + (-3)\u00b2 = 1 + 1 + 9 + 9 = **20**\n**Therefore, the sum of the squares of all real values of *x* for which |2 - |x|| = 1 is 20.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Absolute Value**\nThe equation $|2-|x|| = 1$ involves two absolute values. Let's break it down:\n* **Inner Absolute Value:**  The expression `|x|` represents the distance of *x* from zero. So, if *x* is positive, `|x| = x`. If *x* is negative, `|x| = -x`.\n* **Outer Absolute Value:** The expression `|2 - |x||` represents the distance of `(2 - |x|)` from zero.  We'll need to consider cases for the inner absolute value to determine the outer absolute value.\n**2. Solve for Possible Values of *x***\nLet's consider cases based on the inner absolute value:\n* **Case 1:  *x* \u2265 0** \n   In this case, `|x| = x`.  The equation becomes:\n   ```\n   |2 - x| = 1 \n   ```\n   * This leads to two sub-cases:\n     * **Sub-case 1a:** 2 - x \u2265 0  =>  x \u2264 2 \n        *  2 - x = 1  =>  x = 1 (This solution satisfies x \u2264 2)\n     * **Sub-case 1b:** 2 - x < 0  =>  x > 2\n        *  -(2 - x) = 1  =>  x = 3 (This solution does not satisfy x \u2264 2)\n* **Case 2: *x* < 0** \n   In this case, `|x| = -x`.  The equation becomes:\n   ```\n   |2 + x| = 1\n   ```\n   * This also leads to two sub-cases:\n     * **Sub-case 2a:** 2 + x \u2265 0  =>  x \u2265 -2\n        *  2 + x = 1  =>  x = -1 (This solution satisfies x \u2265 -2)\n     * **Sub-case 2b:** 2 + x < 0  =>  x < -2\n        *  -(2 + x) = 1  =>  x = -3 (This solution satisfies x < -2)\n**3.  Solutions**\nWe found the following solutions for *x*:\n*  x = 1\n*  x = 3\n*  x = -1\n*  x = -3\n**4. Calculate the Sum of Squares**\nNow, let's calculate the sum of the squares of these solutions:\n1\u00b2 + 3\u00b2 + (-1)\u00b2 + (-3)\u00b2 = 1 + 9 + 1 + 9 = **20**\n**Answer:** The sum of the squares of all real values of *x* for which |2 - |x|| = 1 is **20**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Absolute Value**\nThe equation  $|2-|x|| = 1$ involves two absolute values.  We need to consider different cases to get rid of them:\n* **Case 1:  2 - |x| \u2265 0** \n   In this case, |2 - |x|| = 2 - |x|.  Our equation becomes:\n   2 - |x| = 1\n* **Case 2:  2 - |x| < 0**\n   In this case, |2 - |x|| = -(2 - |x|) = |x| - 2. Our equation becomes:\n   |x| - 2 = 1\n**2. Solve for x in each case**\n* **Case 1: 2 - |x| = 1**\n   * Subtract 2 from both sides:  -|x| = -1\n   * Multiply both sides by -1: |x| = 1\n   * This gives us two solutions: x = 1 and x = -1.\n* **Case 2: |x| - 2 = 1**\n   * Add 2 to both sides: |x| = 3\n   * This gives us two solutions: x = 3 and x = -3.\n**3. Check for Valid Solutions**\nWe need to make sure our solutions satisfy the original conditions we set for each case:\n* **Case 1:** We assumed 2 - |x| \u2265 0.  Both solutions (x = 1 and x = -1) satisfy this condition.\n* **Case 2:** We assumed 2 - |x| < 0. Both solutions (x = 3 and x = -3) satisfy this condition.\n**4. Find the Sum of Squares**\nWe have four solutions: x = 1, x = -1, x = 3, and x = -3.  Let's square each and add them:\n1\u00b2 + (-1)\u00b2 + 3\u00b2 + (-3)\u00b2 = 1 + 1 + 9 + 9 = **20**\n**Therefore, the sum of the squares of all real values of x for which |2 - |x|| = 1 is 20.** \n",
