        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Understanding Lattice Points:**\n* Lattice points are points on a coordinate plane where both the x-coordinate and y-coordinate are integers. Think of them as the points where the grid lines intersect.\n**2. Visualizing the Circle:**\n* Imagine a circle with radius 5 centered at the origin.\n**3. Using the Circle Equation:**\n* The equation of a circle centered at the origin is  x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = r\u00b2, where 'r' is the radius. In our case, the equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 25.\n**4. Finding Lattice Points:**\n* We need to find all integer values of 'x' and 'y' that satisfy the equation x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 \u2264 25 (since we want points *within* or *on* the circle).\n**5. Systematic Approach:**\n* **Start with the x-coordinate:**  We know the maximum absolute value of 'x' can be 5 (since 5\u00b2 = 25). \n* **Check for corresponding y-values:** For each x-value, find the corresponding y-values that satisfy the equation.  Be mindful that y-values can be positive, negative, or zero.\n**6. Counting the Points:**\n* **x = 0:**  y = 0, \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b13, \u00b14, \u00b15 (9 points)\n* **x = 1:** y = 0, \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b13, \u00b14 (7 points)\n* **x = 2:** y = 0, \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b13 (5 points)\n* **x = 3:** y = 0, \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b13 (5 points)\n* **x = 4:** y = 0, \u00b11, \u00b12 (3 points)\n* **x = 5:** y = 0 (1 point)\n* Since the circle is symmetrical, we can multiply the counts for positive x-values by 2 (excluding x=0) to account for negative x-values.\n**7. Total Count:**\n* Total points: 9 + (7 * 2) + (5 * 2) + (5 * 2) + (3 * 2) + 1 = 9 + 14 + 10 + 10 + 6 + 1 = **50**\n**Therefore, there are 50 lattice points that lie within or on the circle.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Consider the Quadrant:**\n* Since the circle is centered at the origin and has a radius of 5, we only need to consider the first quadrant (where both x and y coordinates are positive).  The other quadrants will have the same number of lattice points.\n**2.  Lattice Points in the First Quadrant:**\n* **The line x = 5:**  This vertical line intersects the circle at the point (5,0).  All lattice points on this line with y-coordinates less than or equal to 5 are within or on the circle. This gives us 6 points: (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), and (5,5).\n* **The line y = 5:**  Similar to the above, this horizontal line intersects the circle at (0,5), and we have 6 points: (0,5), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), and (5,5).\n* **Points within the square:** The lattice points within the square formed by the lines x=5, y=5, x=0, and y=0 also need to be considered. Since the radius is 5,  we need to check if the distance from the origin to each point is less than or equal to 5.  \n**3. Checking Distances**\n* **Pythagorean Theorem:** We can use the Pythagorean theorem to check the distance from the origin to each lattice point:  distance\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2\n* **Points within the square:**  We need to check points (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), and (4,4).\n* **Checking:** \n    * For example, (2,3): distance\u00b2 = 2\u00b2 + 3\u00b2 = 13, so the distance is less than 5.\n    * (4,4): distance\u00b2 = 4\u00b2 + 4\u00b2 = 32, so the distance is greater than 5.\n**4. Total Lattice Points in the First Quadrant:**\n* Counting the points we found: 6 points on x=5, 6 points on y=5, and 11 points within the square, gives us a total of 23 lattice points in the first quadrant.\n**5. Total Lattice Points in the Entire Circle:**\n* Since we have the same number of lattice points in each quadrant, the total number of lattice points in the entire circle is 23 * 4 = **92**.\n**Therefore, 92 lattice points lie within or on the circle.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Visualize the Circle**\nImagine a circle centered at the origin (0,0) with a radius of 5 units.\n**2. Consider the First Quadrant**\nSince the circle is symmetric, we can focus on finding the lattice points in the first quadrant and then multiply by 4 to get the total.\n**3. Lattice Points on the Circle**\nWe need to find integer values of *x* and *y* that satisfy the equation of the circle:\n*  x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 5\u00b2 \nLet's try some values:\n* **x = 0:**  y\u00b2 = 25,  y = 5 \n* **x = 1:** y\u00b2 = 24, no integer solution for y\n* **x = 2:** y\u00b2 = 21, no integer solution for y\n* **x = 3:** y\u00b2 = 16, y = 4\n* **x = 4:** y\u00b2 = 9, y = 3 \n* **x = 5:** y\u00b2 = 0, y = 0\n**4. Lattice Points Inside the Circle**\nWe know that all points with *x* values from 1 to 4 will have some corresponding *y* values that fall inside the circle.\n**5. Calculate the Total**\n* **First Quadrant:** We found 5 lattice points in the first quadrant: (0,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,0)\n* **All Quadrants:** Multiply by 4: 5 points * 4 = 20 points.\n**Answer:** There are **20** lattice points that lie within or on the circle. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step by step:\n**1. Understand the problem:**\n* We have a circle with a radius of 5 centered at the origin (0, 0).\n* Lattice points are points with integer coordinates (like (1, 2), (-3, 4), etc.).\n* We need to count the number of lattice points that fall inside or on the circle.\n**2. Visualize:**\nImagine the circle drawn on a graph.  The circle will intersect the x-axis and y-axis at points (5, 0), (-5, 0), (0, 5), and (0, -5).  \n**3. Consider the symmetry:**\nSince the circle is centered at the origin, it's symmetrical.  We can focus on one quadrant (let's say the first quadrant where x and y are both positive) and then multiply our count by 4 to get the total.\n**4. Use the circle's equation:**\nThe equation of a circle centered at the origin is:  x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = r\u00b2\nIn our case, r = 5, so the equation is: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 25\n**5. Find the lattice points in the first quadrant:**\n* **Start with y = 0:**  When y = 0, we have x\u00b2 = 25, which means x = 5. So, the point (5, 0) is on the circle.\n* **Check y = 1:** When y = 1, we have x\u00b2 = 24, which means x is not an integer.  Therefore, no lattice points lie on this horizontal line.\n* **Check y = 2:** When y = 2, we have x\u00b2 = 21, which means x is not an integer.\n* **Check y = 3:** When y = 3, we have x\u00b2 = 16, which means x = 4. So, the point (4, 3) is on the circle.\n* **Check y = 4:** When y = 4, we have x\u00b2 = 9, which means x = 3. So, the point (3, 4) is on the circle.\n* **Check y = 5:** When y = 5, we have x\u00b2 = 0, which means x = 0. So, the point (0, 5) is on the circle. \n**6. Count and multiply:**\nIn the first quadrant, we found 4 lattice points: (5, 0), (4, 3), (3, 4), and (0, 5).  Since the circle is symmetrical, there are 4 times this number of lattice points in the entire circle.\n**7. Answer:**\nThere are a total of 4 * 4 = **16** lattice points within or on the circle. \n",

Finding the Boundaries:**\n* The circle will intersect the x-axis and y-axis at points (-5, 0), (5, 0), (0, -5), and (0, 5).\n**4. Considering Quadrants:**\n* Due to symmetry, we can focus on finding lattice points in one quadrant (e.g., the first quadrant) and then multiply by 4 to account for all four quadrants.\n**5.  Using the Equation of a Circle:**\n* The equation of a circle centered at the origin is: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = r\u00b2\n* In this case, r = 5, so the equation is: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 25\n**6.  Counting Lattice Points in the First Quadrant:**\n* **x = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4:**  For each value of x, we can find the corresponding y-value using the equation x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 25.  Remember, y must be an integer.\n    * When x = 0, y = 5\n    * When x = 1, y \u2248 4.89 (not an integer)\n    * When x = 2, y \u2248 4.58 (not an integer)\n    * When x = 3, y \u2248 4 (an integer)\n    * When x = 4, y = 3\n**7. Total Lattice Points:**\n* We found 3 lattice points in the first quadrant: (0, 5), (3, 4), and (4, 3).\n* Multiplying by 4 to account for all quadrants: 3 * 4 = 12\n**Therefore, there are 12 lattice points that lie within or on the circle.** \n"
