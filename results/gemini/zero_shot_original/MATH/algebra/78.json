Understand the Equation**\nThe equation  *y = -4.9t\u00b2 - 3.5t + 2.4* represents the height of the ball at any given time *t*. \n* **-4.9t\u00b2:** This term accounts for the acceleration due to gravity (approximately -9.8 m/s\u00b2, but we use -4.9 because it's half of gravity since we're looking at the height). \n* **-3.5t:** This term represents the initial downward velocity of the ball.\n* **2.4:** This is the initial height from which the ball was thrown.\n**2.
