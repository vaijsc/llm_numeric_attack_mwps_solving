    "solution": "We start by completing the square: \\begin{align*}\n-x^2 -8x +12 &= -(x^2 + 8x) + 12\\\\\n& = -(x^2 + 8x + (8/2)^2 - (8/2)^2) + 12\\\\\n& = -((x+4)^2 -4^2) + 12 \\\\\n&= -(x+4)^2 +4^2 + 12 \\\\\n&= -(x+4)^2 + 28.\\end{align*} Since the square of a real number is at least 0, we have $(x+4)^2\\ge 0$, so $-(x+4)^2 \\le 0$.  Therefore, $-(x+4)^2 + 28$ is at most 28.  Since $(x+4)^2 =0$ when $x=-4$, this maximum of $\\boxed{28}$ is achieved when $x= -4$.",

        "Here's how to find the maximum value of the quadratic expression:\n**1. Understand the Shape**\nThe expression -x\u00b2 - 8x + 12 represents a parabola that opens downwards (because the coefficient of the x\u00b2 term is negative). This means it has a maximum point.\n**2. Finding the Vertex**\nThe maximum value occurs at the vertex of the parabola. We can find the x-coordinate of the vertex using the formula:\nx = -b / 2a \nWhere 'a' and 'b' are the coefficients of the quadratic expression (in the form ax\u00b2 + bx + c):\n* a = -1\n* b = -8\nTherefore:\nx = -(-8) / (2 * -1) = 4\n**3. Finding the Maximum Value**\nNow that we know the x-coordinate of the vertex is 4, we can substitute it back into the original expression to find the maximum value:\n- (4)\u00b2 - 8(4) + 12 = -16 - 32 + 12 = -36\n**Answer:** The maximum value of -x\u00b2 - 8x + 12 is **-36**. \n",
