    "solution": "We apply Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick to the left side.  We first find a pair of binomials whose product produces the three terms on the left side: $(2x+3)(5y+7) = 10xy+14x+15y+21$.  So, we add $21$ to both sides of the original equation to get $10xy+14x+15y+21=187$.  Factoring then gives $(2x+3)(5y+7)=187=11\\cdot17$.  If either $(2x+3)$ or $(5y+7)$ equal 1, then $x$ or $y$ would be negative.  If $5y+7$ equals 11, then $y$ would not be an integer.  So, $5y+7=17$ and $2x+3=11$.  Solving for $(x,y)$ gives $(4,2)$.  Therefore, $x+y=\\boxed{6}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step by step:\n**1. Rearrange the Equation**\nOur goal is to manipulate the equation to make it easier to work with.  We can do this by factoring by grouping:\n* **Add 105 to both sides:** \n   This will help us create a common factor:\n   ```\n   10xy + 14x + 15y + 105 = 166 + 105 \n   ```\n* **Factor by grouping:**\n   ```\n   10xy + 14x + 15y + 105 = 271\n   2x(5y + 7) + 3(5y + 7) = 271\n   (2x + 3)(5y + 7) = 271\n   ```\n**2. Find the Factors of 271**\nSince 271 is a prime number, its only factors are 1 and 271.  This means:\n* **Either:** 2x + 3 = 1  and 5y + 7 = 271\n* **Or:** 2x + 3 = 271 and 5y + 7 = 1\n**3. Solve for x and y**\nLet's consider each possibility:\n* **Case 1:**\n   * 2x + 3 = 1  => x = -1 (This is not a positive integer solution, so we discard it)\n* **Case 2:**\n   * 2x + 3 = 271 => x = 134 \n   * 5y + 7 = 1 => y = -6/5 (This is not an integer solution, so we discard it)\n**4. No Solution**\nWe've exhausted all possible factorizations of 271, and neither case resulted in positive integer values for x and y.  Therefore, there is no solution to the equation in positive integers.\n**Conclusion:** There is no solution for the equation  10xy + 14x + 15y = 166 in positive integers.  Therefore, we cannot find x + y. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Rearrange the Equation:**\nThe equation is a bit messy, so let's rearrange it to make it easier to work with. We can factor by grouping:\n*  Start by adding 105 to both sides: \n   ```\n   10xy + 14x + 15y + 105 = 166 + 105 \n   ```\n*  Factor out common terms:\n   ```\n   10x(y + 1) + 15(y + 1) = 271\n   ```\n*  Factor out the common factor of (y + 1):\n   ```\n   (10x + 15)(y + 1) = 271\n   ```\n**2. Find the Factors of 271:**\nNow we need to find the factors of 271.  Since 271 is a prime number, its only factors are 1 and 271.\n**3. Solve for x and y:**\nSince (10x + 15) and (y + 1) are factors of 271, we have two possibilities:\n* **Possibility 1:**\n   ```\n   10x + 15 = 271  \n   10x = 256\n   x = 25.6 \n   ```\n   Since x must be a positive integer, this possibility is not valid.\n* **Possibility 2:**\n   ```\n   10x + 15 = 1\n   10x = -14\n   x = -1.4 \n   ```\n   Again, this is not valid because x must be a positive integer.\n   ```\n   y + 1 = 271\n   y = 270\n   ```\n**4. Calculate x + y:**\nSince the only valid solution is y = 270, and we don't have a valid value for x, there are no integer solutions to the original equation.  Therefore, we cannot find x + y. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Rearrange the equation:**\n   The equation has terms involving *x* and *y*.  Let's rearrange it to make it easier to work with:\n   *  Start by moving the constant term to the right side: \n      10xy + 14x + 15y = 166 \n      10xy + 14x + 15y - 166 = 0\n   * Now, let's try to factor the left side. Notice that the coefficients of the *x* and *y* terms (14 and 15) have a common factor of 1. We can use this to help us factor: \n      10xy + (14x + 15y) - 166 = 0 \n   *  To factor, we want to find two numbers that multiply to 10 * -166 = -1660 and add up to 14 * 15 = 210.  After some trial and error, we find that 220 and -7 work:\n      10xy + 220x - 7y - 166 = 0\n   *  Now, factor by grouping:\n      10x(y + 22) - 7(y + 22) = 0\n   *  Finally, factor out the common factor (y + 22):\n      (10x - 7)(y + 22) = 0\n**2. Solve for possible values of *x* and *y*:**\n    For the product of two factors to be zero, at least one of them must be zero.  This gives us two possibilities:\n    *  **Possibility 1:** 10x - 7 = 0 \n       *  Solving for *x*, we get x = 7/10.  Since *x* must be a positive integer, this possibility is not valid.\n    *  **Possibility 2:** y + 22 = 0\n       *  Solving for *y*, we get y = -22. Again, this is not a valid solution because *y* must be a positive integer.\n**3. Conclusion:**\n   We have found that there are no positive integer solutions for *x* and *y* that satisfy the given equation. Therefore, there is no solution for *x + y*. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Factor by Grouping**\n* Notice that the left side of the equation has terms that can be grouped:\n   *  The first two terms have a common factor of 2x:  10xy + 14x = 2x(5y + 7)\n   *  The last two terms have a common factor of 3:  15y + 166 = 3(5y + 7) + 151\n* Rewrite the equation using these groupings:\n   2x(5y + 7) + 3(5y + 7) = 166\n* Now factor out the common binomial (5y + 7):\n   (5y + 7)(2x + 3) = 166\n**2. Find the Factors of 166**\n* Find the factors of 166: 1, 2, 83, 166\n**3. Solve for Possible Values**\n*  Since both *x* and *y* are positive integers, we need to find pairs of factors of 166 that will make (2x + 3) and (5y + 7) positive integers.  Let's try the possibilities:\n    * If (5y + 7) = 1, then y is not an integer, so this doesn't work.\n    * If (5y + 7) = 2, then y is not an integer, so this doesn't work.\n    * If (5y + 7) = 83, then y = 15 (this works!)\n    * If (5y + 7) = 166, then y is not an integer, so this doesn't work.\n*  Now we have a value for *y*.  Let's find *x*:\n    * If (5y + 7) = 83, then (2x + 3) = 2.  This gives us x = -1/2, which is not a positive integer, so this solution doesn't work.\n**Conclusion**\nSince we didn't find any solutions where both *x* and *y* are positive integers, there is **no solution** to this equation.  Therefore, we cannot find the value of *x + y*. \n",
