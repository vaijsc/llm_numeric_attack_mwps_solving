Understanding Geometric Sequences**\nA geometric sequence is a sequence where each term is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant value called the common ratio (r).  \n**2. Setting up Equations**\nLet the first term of the sequence be 'a' and the common ratio be 'r'. We know:\n*  The third term is 1053:  ar\u00b2 = 1053 \n*  The ninth term is 13/9: ar\u2078 = 13/9\n**3. Solving for the Common Ratio (r)**\nDivide the second equation by the first equation:\n(ar\u2078) / (ar\u00b2) = (13/9) / 1053\nThis simplifies to: r\u2076 = 1/729\nTaking the sixth root of both sides, we get: r = 1/3\n**4. Finding the Seventh Term**\nThe seventh term of the geometric sequence is given by: a * r\u2076\nWe know r = 1/3, and we can find 'a' by using the equation ar\u00b2 = 1053 and substituting r = 1/3:\na * (1/3)\u00b2 = 1053\na * (1/9) = 1053\na = 9477\nTherefore, the seventh term is:\na * r\u2076 = 9477 * (1/3)\u2076 = **13**\n**Therefore, the value of the seventh term is 13.** \n",
