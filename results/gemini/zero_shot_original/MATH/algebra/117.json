    "solution": "We can factor the given product using Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick. Factor $1001001$ out of the first two terms and $-1001$ out of the second two terms to find $$(1001001)(1010101+989899)-1001(989899+1010101).$$Since $1010101+989899=2000000$, we can complete the factoring as \\begin{align*}(1001001-1001)(2000000)&=(1000000)(2000000)\\\\&=2000000000000.\\end{align*}Thus we can see that the rightmost non-zero digit $a=2$, and it is followed by 12 zeroes so $b=12$. Thus $(a,b)=\\boxed{(2,12)}$.",

        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Factor out common terms:**\nNotice that we can factor out common terms in the expression:\n```\n(1001001)(1010101) + (989899)(1001001) - (1001)(989899) - (1010101)(1001) \n= (1001001)(1010101 + 989899) - (1001)(989899 + 1010101)\n= (1001001)(1999999) - (1001)(1999999)\n= (1999999)(1001001 - 1001)\n= (1999999)(999000)\n```\n**2. Focus on the rightmost digits:**\nTo find the rightmost non-zero digit, we only need to look at the last digits of the factors:\n*  The rightmost digit of 1999999 is 9.\n*  The rightmost digit of 999000 is 0.\n**3. Multiply the last digits:**\nThe rightmost digit of the product is the product of the rightmost digits of the factors: 9 * 0 = 0. \n**4. Find the number of trailing zeroes:**\nSince the product ends in a zero, there's at least one trailing zero. To find the number of trailing zeroes, we count how many pairs of 2 and 5 are in the prime factorization of the product:\n* **1999999:** This number is odd, so it doesn't contribute any factors of 2 or 5.\n* **999000:** This number has three factors of 5 (from 5 * 5 * 5 * 1000 = 5 * 5 * 5 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 125). It also has three factors of 2 (from 2 * 2 * 2 * 125). \nSince we have three pairs of 2 and 5, there are **three** trailing zeros.\n**Answer:**\nTherefore, the rightmost non-zero digit is **0**, and it is followed by **3** zeros. The ordered pair is **(0, 3)**. \n",
        "We can simplify the expression by factoring:\n\\begin{align*}\n&(1001001)(1010101)+(989899)(1001001)\\\\\n&\\qquad -(1001)(989899)-(1010101)(1001)\\\\\n&= (1001001)(1010101 + 989899) - (1001)(989899 + 1010101)\\\\\n&= (1001001)(2000000) - (1001)(2000000)\\\\\n&= (1001001 - 1001)(2000000)\\\\\n&= (999000)(2000000)\n\\end{align*}\nNow, notice that $(999000)(2000000)$ is a product of two numbers ending in zeros. To find the rightmost non-zero digit, we only need to look at the product of the non-zero digits: $9\\times2=18$.\nTherefore, the rightmost non-zero digit is $a=8$ and it is followed by $b=6$ zeroes. \nThe answer is $(a,b) = \\boxed{(8,6)}$. \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Factor out common terms:**\nNotice that the first two terms have a common factor of (1001001), and the last two terms have a common factor of (1001).  Let's factor these out:\n```\n(1001001)(1010101) + (989899)(1001001) - (1001)(989899) - (1010101)(1001) \n= (1001001)(1010101 + 989899) - (1001)(989899 + 1010101)\n```\n**2. Simplify the expressions inside the parentheses:**\n```\n= (1001001)(2000000) - (1001)(2000000)\n```\n**3.

Determine the rightmost non-zero digit:**\nSince both products end in 0, their sum will also end in 0.
