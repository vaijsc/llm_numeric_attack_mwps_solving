    "solution": "The common difference is 2, so the $n^{\\text{th}}$ term in the sequence is $28 + 2(n - 1) = 2n + 26$.  If $2n + 26 = 86$, then $n = 30$, so the sequence contains 30 terms.\n\nThe sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, so the sum is $\\frac{(28 + 86)}{2} \\cdot 30 = \\boxed{1710}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Identify the pattern:**\n* The series is arithmetic because there's a constant difference between consecutive terms (in this case, 2).\n**2. Find the key values:**\n* **First term (a):** 28\n* **Common difference (d):** 2\n* **Last term (l):** 86\n**3. Determine the number of terms (n):**\n*  We can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic series:  l = a + (n - 1)d \n*  Substitute the known values: 86 = 28 + (n - 1)2\n*  Simplify and solve for n:\n    * 86 = 28 + 2n - 2\n    * 58 = 2n\n    * n = 29\n**4. Apply the formula for the sum (S) of an arithmetic series:**\n* S = (n/2)(a + l)\n* Substitute the known values: S = (29/2)(28 + 86)\n* Simplify: S = (29/2)(114) = 1653\n**Therefore, the value of the arithmetic series is 1653.** \n",
