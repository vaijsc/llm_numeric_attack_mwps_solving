        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Factor the denominator on the right side:**\nThe denominator on the right side,  $x^2 - 1$, factors as a difference of squares: $(x-1)(x+1)$.\n**2. Combine the fractions on the left side:**\nTo combine the fractions on the left side, we need a common denominator:\n```\n(A/(x-1)) + (B/(x+1))  =  (A(x+1) + B(x-1)) / ((x-1)(x+1)) \n```\n**3. Set the numerators equal:**\nSince the fractions must be equal for all values of *x* (except *x* = 1 and *x* = -1), the numerators must be equal:\n```\nA(x+1) + B(x-1) = x + 2\n```\n**4. Expand and collect like terms:**\nExpand the left side:\n```\nAx + A + Bx - B = x + 2\n```\nCombine *x* terms and constant terms:\n```\n(A + B)x + (A - B) = x + 2\n```\n**5. Equate coefficients:**\nFor the two sides to be equal for all *x*, the coefficients of *x* must be equal, and the constant terms must be equal:\n*  A + B = 1  (coefficient of *x*)\n*  A - B = 2  (constant term)\n**6. Solve the system of equations:**\nWe now have two equations with two unknowns.  We can solve for *A* and *B* using elimination or substitution.  Let's use elimination:\nAdd the two equations together:\n```\n2A = 3 \n```\nSolve for *A*:\n```\nA = 3/2\n```\nSubstitute this value of *A* back into either of the original equations to solve for *B*. Let's use the first equation:\n```\n(3/2) + B = 1\n```\nSolve for *B*:\n```\nB = -1/2\n```\n**7. Find A - B:**\nFinally, calculate *A - B*:\n```\nA - B = (3/2) - (-1/2) = 2\n```\n**Therefore, A - B = 2.** \n",
