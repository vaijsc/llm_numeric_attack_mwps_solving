    "problem": "What is the greatest possible value of $a$ in the system of equations $5a + 2b = 0$ and $ab = -10$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Though we can solve this by substitution, an easier way to solve the problem is to simply add the two equations. Then, $$ab + 5a + 2b = -10 \\Longrightarrow ab + 5a + 2b + 10 = 0.$$ This factors! Thus, $(a+2)(b+5) = 0$, from which it follows that at least one of the two statements $a = -2$, $b = -5$ is true. In the latter case, we obtain $a = \\boxed{2}$, which yields the largest possible value of $a$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Solve for one variable in terms of the other:**\n* From the equation  5a + 2b = 0, we can solve for  'b':\n   2b = -5a\n   b = -5a/2\n**2. Substitute into the second equation:**\n* Substitute the expression for 'b' from step 1 into the equation ab = -10:\n   a * (-5a/2) = -10\n**3. Simplify and solve the quadratic:**\n* Multiply both sides by -2: 5a\u00b2 = 20\n* Divide both sides by 5: a\u00b2 = 4\n* Take the square root of both sides: a = \u00b12\n**4. Determine the greatest possible value:**\n* We have two possible solutions for 'a': a = 2 and a = -2.\n* The greatest possible value of 'a' is **2**. \n",
