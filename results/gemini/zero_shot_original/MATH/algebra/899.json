        "Here's how to solve the inequality step-by-step:\n1. **Multiply both sides by 5:** \n   ```\n   |9 + 2a| < 5 \n   ```\n2. **Consider both positive and negative cases:**\n   * **Case 1:  9 + 2a \u2265 0**\n      This means  9 + 2a  is positive, so we can drop the absolute value bars:\n      ```\n      9 + 2a < 5\n      ```\n      Solving for *a*:\n      ```\n      2a < -4\n      a < -2 \n      ```\n      However, we need to make sure this solution satisfies the original condition that 9 + 2a \u2265 0.  Solving for *a* in that inequality:\n      ```\n      2a \u2265 -9\n      a \u2265 -9/2\n      ```\n      Since our solution *a* < -2 satisfies this condition, it's a valid solution for this case.\n   * **Case 2: 9 + 2a < 0**\n      This means 9 + 2a is negative, so we need to multiply the expression inside the absolute value by -1 before dropping the bars:\n      ```\n      -(9 + 2a) < 5\n      ```\n      Solving for *a*:\n      ```\n      -9 - 2a < 5\n      -2a < 14\n      a > -7\n      ```\n      Again, we need to make sure this solution satisfies the original condition that 9 + 2a < 0. Solving for *a*:\n      ```\n      2a < -9\n      a < -9/2\n      ```\n      Since our solution *a* > -7  satisfies this condition, it's a valid solution for this case.\n3. **Combine the solutions:**\n   The solutions from both cases are:\n   *  *a* < -2\n   *  *a* > -7\n   Combining these, we get:  -7 < *a* < -2\n4. **Express in interval notation:**\n   The solution in interval notation is **(-7, -2)**. \n",

The solutions where a < -2 satisfy both conditions.\n   * **Case 2:  9 + 2a < 0**\n      This means -(9 + 2a) < 5.  Solving for *a*:\n      ```\n      -9 - 2a < 5\n      -2a < 14\n      a > -7\n      ```\n      Again, we need to make sure our solution satisfies 9 + 2a < 0.
