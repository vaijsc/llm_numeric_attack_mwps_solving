    "solution": "We could substitute $(13-\\sqrt{131})/4$ for $x$ in the equation, but the quadratic formula suggests a quicker approach. Substituting $2$, $-13$, and $k$ into the quadratic formula gives  \\[\n\\frac{-(-13)\\pm\\sqrt{(-13)^2-4(2)(k)}}{2(2)}= \\frac{13\\pm\\sqrt{169-8k}}{4}.\n\\]Setting $(13+\\sqrt{169-8k})/4$ and $(13-\\sqrt{169-8k})/4$ equal to $(13-\\sqrt{131})/4$, we find no solution in the first case and $169-8k=131$ in the second case.  Solving yields $k=(169-131)/8=38/8=\\boxed{\\frac{19}{4}}$.",
