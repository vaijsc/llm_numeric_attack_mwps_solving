        "Here's how to solve this:\n* **Understanding the Problem:** We need to find a fraction 'x' where 4 raised to the power of 'x' equals 8.  This can be written as: 4^x = 8.\n* **Finding the Solution:**\n    *  Since 8 is not a direct power of 4, we need to express both sides of the equation with the same base.  We know that 8 is the same as 2 cubed (2^3). \n    * We also know that 4 is the same as 2 squared (2^2).\n    * Substituting these into our equation: (2^2)^x = 2^3\n    * Using the rule of exponents that says (a^m)^n = a^(m*n), we get: 2^(2x) = 2^3\n    * For the bases to be equal, the exponents must be equal. Therefore, 2x = 3\n    * Solving for x: x = 3/2\n**Answer:** The power of 4 that is equal to 8 is **3/2**. \n",
        "We want to find the exponent *x* that satisfies the equation:\n4^x = 8\nNotice that 8 is the same as 2^3.  We can rewrite 4 as 2^2.  Substituting these into our equation gives:\n(2^2)^x = 2^3\nUsing the rule of exponents that says (a^m)^n = a^(m*n), we simplify the left side:\n2^(2*x) = 2^3\nFor the two sides to be equal, the exponents must be equal:\n2*x = 3\nSolving for x, we get:\nx = 3/2\nTherefore, the power of 4 that is equal to 8 is **3/2**. \n",
        "We need to find the exponent *x* such that 4^x = 8.  \nSince 8 is not a perfect power of 4, we know *x* will be a fraction. \nLet's rewrite 8 as a power of 2: 8 = 2^3.\nNow, we can rewrite 4 as 2^2.  Therefore, we have: \n(2^2)^x = 2^3\nUsing the rule of exponents that says (a^m)^n = a^(m*n), we get:\n2^(2x) = 2^3\nSince the bases are the same, we can equate the exponents:\n2x = 3\nSolving for x, we get:\nx = 3/2\nTherefore, the power of 4 that equals 8 is **3/2**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this:\n* **Understanding the problem:** We need to find an exponent 'x' such that 4 raised to that power equals 8.  In other words, we're looking for the solution to the equation: 4^x = 8\n* **Expressing 8 as a power of 4:**  We know that 8 is the same as 2 cubed (2 x 2 x 2 = 8).  We also know that 4 is the same as 2 squared (2 x 2 = 4).\n* **Combining the powers:**  We can rewrite 8 as 2\u00b3 = (2\u00b2)^(3/2) = 4^(3/2). \n* **Solution:** Therefore, 4^(3/2) = 8. \n**Answer:** The power of 4 that is equal to 8 is **3/2**. \n",
