    "solution": "The vertex form of a parabolic equation is $y=a(x-h)^2+k$. Since we are given that the vertex is at $(2,1)$, we know that $h=2$ and $k=1$. Plugging that into our equation gives $y=a(x-2)^2+1$. Now, substituting the other given point $(-4,-3)$ into the equation to solve for $a$, we have  \\begin{align*}\n-3&=a(-4-2)^2+1\\\\\n-4&=a(-6)^2\\\\\n-4&=36a\\\\\n-\\frac{1}{9}&=a\n\\end{align*} So the equation for the graphed parabola is $y=-\\frac{1}{9}(x-2)^2+1$. The zeros of the quadratic occur when $y=0$, so plugging that value into the equation to solve for $x$, we have $0=-\\frac{1}{9}(x-2)^2+1 \\Rightarrow (x-2)^2=9$. Taking the square root of both sides yields $x-2=\\pm 3$, so $x=5$ or $x=-1$. Thus, $m=5$ and $n=-1$, so $m-n=5-(-1)=\\boxed{6}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Relationship Between Zeros and the Vertex**\n* The vertex of a parabola represents the maximum or minimum point of the function. In this case, the parabola opens downwards, so the vertex is the maximum point.\n* The axis of symmetry of the parabola passes through the vertex and divides the parabola into two symmetrical halves.  The zeros of the quadratic are equidistant from the axis of symmetry.\n**2. Find the Axis of Symmetry**\n* The x-coordinate of the vertex gives us the axis of symmetry. Here, the vertex is (2,1), so the axis of symmetry is the vertical line x = 2.\n**3. Determine the Distance from the Axis of Symmetry to a Zero**\n* We are given a point on the parabola, (-4, -3).  This point is 6 units to the left of the axis of symmetry (x = 2). \n* Since the parabola is symmetrical, the other zero must also be 6 units away from the axis of symmetry, but to the right. This means the other zero is at x = 8.\n**4. Calculate m - n**\n* We are given that m > n.  Therefore, m = 8 and n = -4.\n*  m - n = 8 - (-4) = **12**\n**Answer:** m - n = 12 \n",

Find the Midpoint**\n* The vertex is at (2,1).\n* The point (-4,-3) lies on the parabola.\n* Since the parabola is symmetrical, the midpoint of the segment connecting (-4,-3) and the other zero is (2,1).\n**3. Calculate the Distance**\n* The x-coordinate of (-4,-3) is -4.\n* The x-coordinate of the vertex is 2.\n* The distance between them is 2 - (-4) = 6.\n**4.

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Relationship Between Zeros and the Vertex**\n* The vertex of a parabola is the point where the graph reaches its maximum or minimum value.\n* The zeros (or roots) of a quadratic are the points where the graph intersects the x-axis.\n* The x-coordinate of the vertex is the average of the zeros. \n**2. Apply the Concept**\n* We know the vertex is at (2, 1).  This means the x-coordinate of the vertex is 2.\n* We're given that the zeros are at *x* = *m* and *x* = *n*, where *m* > *n*.\n* Since the x-coordinate of the vertex is the average of the zeros, we can write:  ( *m* + *n* ) / 2 = 2.\n**3. Solve for m - n**\n* Multiply both sides of the equation by 2: *m* + *n* = 4\n* Subtract *n* from both sides: *m* = 4 - *n*\n* Subtract *n* from both sides again: *m* - *n* = 4 - 2*n*\n* Since *m* > *n*,  *m* - *n* is positive.  \n* We don't have enough information to find the exact values of *m* and *n*, but we can see from the graph that the parabola is symmetric, and the distance between the vertex and each zero is the same. This means that the distance between the zeros (*m* - *n*) is twice the distance between the vertex and either zero.\n**4. Determine the Distance**\n* Look at the graph.  The distance between the vertex (2, 1) and the point (-4, -3) is 6 units.\n* Therefore, *m* - *n* is 2 * 6 = **12**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n* We're given the graph of a parabola and the vertex (2, 1).\n* We know the zeros of the quadratic are at *x = m* and *x = n*, where *m > n*.\n* We need to find the difference between the zeros, *m - n*.\n**2. Key Property of Parabolas**\nThe key property we'll use is that the vertex of a parabola is exactly in the middle of the two zeros (roots). \n**3. Finding the Zeros**\n* **Visualize:**  Look at the graph.  Since the vertex is at *x = 2*, and the zeros are symmetrically placed around the vertex, one zero must be to the left of *x = 2* and the other to the right.\n* **Find the Distance:**  The point (-4, -3) lies on the parabola and is to the left of the vertex. The distance between *x = -4* and *x = 2* is 6 units.\n* **Symmetry:** Because the zeros are symmetric, the other zero must be 6 units to the right of *x = 2*.  This means the other zero is at *x = 8*.\n**4. Calculate m - n**\n* We have *m = 8* and *n = -4* \n* Therefore, *m - n = 8 - (-4) = 12*\n**Answer:** The difference between the zeros is **12**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Concept of Zeros**\n* The zeros of a quadratic function are the x-values where the graph crosses the x-axis.  In other words, they are the solutions to the equation  *ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0*.\n**2.  Use the Vertex to Find the Axis of Symmetry**\n* The vertex of the parabola is at (2, 1).  The axis of symmetry is a vertical line that passes through the vertex.  Therefore, the equation of the axis of symmetry is *x = 2*.\n**3.  Symmetry and Zeros**\n* Since the parabola is symmetric, the zeros are equidistant from the axis of symmetry.  This means the distance from the axis of symmetry to one zero is the same as the distance from the axis of symmetry to the other zero.\n**4.  Find the Distance to the Known Zero**\n* We are given a point on the parabola: (-4, -3).  The x-coordinate of this point is -4, and the axis of symmetry is at *x = 2*.  The distance between these is 6 units.\n**5.  Determine the Other Zero**\n* Since the zeros are equidistant from the axis of symmetry, the other zero must be 6 units to the right of the axis of symmetry.
