    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since $f(2) = 6$, we have $f^{-1}(6)=2$. (Note that the hypothesis that $f$ has an inverse implies that there are no other values of $x$ with $f(x) = 6$.)  Similarly, $f(1) =2$ implies $f^{-1}(2)=1$.   So $f^{-1}(f^{-1}(6))=f^{-1}(2)=\\boxed{1}$.",

If  $f(a) = b$, then  $f^{-1}(b) = a$. \n2. **Finding the first inverse:**  We know  $f(2) = 6$. Using the inverse property, this means  $f^{-1}(6) = 2$.\n3. **Finding the second inverse:** Now we need to find  $f^{-1}(2)$.  We know  $f(1) = 2$.
