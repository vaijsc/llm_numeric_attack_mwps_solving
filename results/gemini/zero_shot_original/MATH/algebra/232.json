        "Here's how to evaluate the expression:\n**Understanding the Properties**\n* **Cube root:** The cube root of a number, denoted by $\\sqrt[3]{}$, is the number that, when multiplied by itself three times, equals the original number. For example, $\\sqrt[3]{8} = 2$ because $2\\times2\\times2 = 8$.\n* **Exponent:** An exponent indicates how many times a base number is multiplied by itself. For example, $2^3 = 2\\times2\\times2 = 8$.\n**Solving the Expression**\n1. **Simplify the cube root:** $(\\sqrt[3]{13})^6 = (\\sqrt[3]{13}\\times\\sqrt[3]{13}\\times\\sqrt[3]{13})^2$. Since the cube root of 13 multiplied by itself three times equals 13, we can simplify this to $13^2$.\n2. **Calculate the exponent:** $13^2 = 13\\times13 = 169$.\n**Therefore, $(\\sqrt[3]{13})^6 = 169$.** \n",
