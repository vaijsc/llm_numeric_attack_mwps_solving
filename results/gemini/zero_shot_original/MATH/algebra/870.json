    "solution": "Rearranging the expression, we have  \\[2x^2+8x+3y^2-24y+62\\]We first complete the square in $x$. Factoring a 2 from the first two terms of the expression, we get  \\[2(x^2+4x)+3y^2-24y+62\\]In order for the expression inside the parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \\[2(x^2+4x+4-4)+3y^2-24y+62 \\Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3y^2-24y+54\\]Now we complete the square in $y$. Factoring a 3 from the $y$ terms in the expression, we get \\[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y)+54\\]In order for the expression inside the second parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(8/2)^2=16$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \\[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y+16-16)+54 \\Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3(y-4)^2+6\\]Since the minimum value of $2(x+2)^2$ and $3(y-4)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\\boxed{6}$, and is achieved when $x=-2$ and $y=4$.",

This happens when x = -2 and y = 4.\n**4. The Minimum Value**\nWhen x = -2 and y = 4, the expression becomes: 2(0) + 3(0) - 18 = **-18**\n**Answer:** The minimum value of the expression is **-18**. \n",
        "We can find the minimum value of the expression by completing the square.

        "Here's how to find the minimum value of the expression step-by-step:\n**1. Complete the Square**\n* **Focus on the x terms:**  \n   The first two terms involving 'x' are  2x\u00b2 + 8x.  To complete the square, take half of the coefficient of the 'x' term (which is 8), square it (giving 16), and add and subtract it inside the expression:\n   ```\n   2x\u00b2 + 8x = 2(x\u00b2 + 4x) = 2(x\u00b2 + 4x + 16 - 16) = 2(x + 2)\u00b2 - 32\n   ```\n* **Focus on the y terms:** \n   Similarly, for the 'y' terms:\n   ```\n   3y\u00b2 - 24y = 3(y\u00b2 - 8y) = 3(y\u00b2 - 8y + 16 - 16) = 3(y - 4)\u00b2 - 48\n   ```\n**2. Rewrite the Expression**\nNow we can rewrite the original expression:\n```\n2x\u00b2 + 3y\u00b2 + 8x - 24y + 62 \n= 2(x + 2)\u00b2 - 32 + 3(y - 4)\u00b2 - 48 + 62 \n= 2(x + 2)\u00b2 + 3(y - 4)\u00b2 - 18\n```\n**3. Minimum Value**\nNotice that both  (x + 2)\u00b2 and (y - 4)\u00b2 are squared terms.  Squared terms are always greater than or equal to zero.  Therefore:\n* 2(x + 2)\u00b2 \u2265 0\n* 3(y - 4)\u00b2 \u2265 0\nThis means the entire expression will be minimized when both (x + 2)\u00b2 and (y - 4)\u00b2 are equal to zero.  This happens when:\n* x = -2\n* y = 4\n**4. The Answer**\nThe minimum value of the expression is obtained when x = -2 and y = 4.  Substituting these values back into the rewritten expression:\n2(-2 + 2)\u00b2 + 3(4 - 4)\u00b2 - 18 = **-18**\nTherefore, the minimum value of the expression is **-18**. \n",
        "Here's how to find the minimum value of the expression:\n**1. Complete the Square**\nWe'll use the technique of completing the square to rewrite the expression in a more manageable form.  \n* **Focus on the x-terms:**  \n   Take the coefficient of the $x$ term (which is 8), divide it by 2 (giving 4), square it (giving 16), and add and subtract it inside the expression:\n   \n   ```\n   2x^2 + 8x + 16 - 16 + 3y^2 - 24y + 62 \n   ```\n* **Focus on the y-terms:** \n   Do the same with the $y$ terms. The coefficient of the $y$ term is -24, so divide by 2 (-12), square it (144), and add and subtract it:\n   ```\n   2x^2 + 8x + 16 - 16 + 3y^2 - 24y + 144 - 144 + 62\n   ```\n**2. Factor and Simplify**\n* **Factor the x-terms:** The first three terms now form a perfect square trinomial:\n   ```\n   2(x^2 + 4x + 8) - 16 + 3(y^2 - 8y + 48) - 144 + 62\n   ```\n   Factor the trinomial: \n   ```\n   2(x + 2)^2 - 16 + 3(y - 4)^2 - 144 + 62\n   ```\n* **Factor the y-terms:**\n   ```\n   2(x + 2)^2 - 16 + 3(y - 4)^2 - 144 + 62\n   ```\n* **Combine constants:**\n   ```\n   2(x + 2)^2 + 3(y - 4)^2 - 98\n   ```\n**3. Analyze the Expression**\nThe expression is now in the form:\n  \n  *  2(x + 2)^2 + 3(y - 4)^2 - 98\nNotice that:\n*  Both (x + 2)^2 and (y - 4)^2 are squared terms, which are always greater than or equal to zero.\n*  The coefficients of the squared terms (2 and 3) are positive.\nThis means that the entire expression is minimized when both (x + 2)^2 and (y - 4)^2 are equal to zero.  This occurs when:\n*  x = -2\n*  y = 4\n**4. Find the Minimum Value**\nSubstitute these values of x and y back into the simplified expression:\n2(-2 + 2)^2 + 3(4 - 4)^2 - 98 = -98\n**Answer:** The minimum value of the expression is **-98**. \n",
