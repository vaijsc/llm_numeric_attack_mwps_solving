        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Set up the equations:**\n* We're given that the expression has the value of 15 when x = 2:  a + 2b = 15\n* We're also given that the expression has the value of 3 when x = 5: a + 5b = 3\n**2. Solve for 'a' in terms of 'b':**\n* From the first equation (a + 2b = 15), we can isolate 'a': \n   a = 15 - 2b\n**3. Substitute the value of 'a' into the second equation:**\n* Substitute (15 - 2b) for 'a' in the equation a + 5b = 3:\n   (15 - 2b) + 5b = 3\n**4. Simplify and solve for 'b':**\n* Combine like terms: 15 + 3b = 3\n* Subtract 15 from both sides: 3b = -12\n* Divide both sides by 3: b = -4\n**5. Substitute the value of 'b' back into the equation for 'a':**\n* We know a = 15 - 2b\n* Substitute b = -4: a = 15 - 2(-4) = 15 + 8 = 23\n**6. Calculate a + b:**\n* a + b = 23 + (-4) = 19\n**Therefore, a + b = 19** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Set up equations:**\n* We know that when x = 2, the expression equals 15.
