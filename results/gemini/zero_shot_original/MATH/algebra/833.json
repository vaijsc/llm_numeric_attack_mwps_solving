Understand the Properties of Geometric Sequences**\n* **Common Ratio (r):** In a geometric sequence, each term is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant value called the common ratio (r).\n* **General Formula:** The nth term of a geometric sequence is given by:  a_n = a_1 * r^(n-1) \n    * a_n = the nth term\n    * a_1 = the first term\n    * r = the common ratio\n    * n = the term number\n**2. Set Up Equations**\n* We know a_1 = 7 and a_7 = 5103. \n* Using the general formula, we can write two equations:\n    * a_7 = a_1 * r^(7-1)  =>  5103 = 7 * r^6\n    * a_5 = a_1 * r^(5-1)  =>  a_5 = 7 * r^4\n**3. Solve for the Common Ratio (r)**\n* Divide the equation for a_7 by the equation for a_5:\n    * (5103 / 7 * r^6) / (7 * r^4) = 5103 / 7 = r^2\n* Simplify and solve for r:\n    * r^2 = 729 \n    * r = 27 (We take the positive root since we're dealing with a geometric sequence)\n**4.
