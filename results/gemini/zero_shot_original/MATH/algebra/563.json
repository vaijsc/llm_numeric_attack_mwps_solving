        "Here's how to solve the equation step-by-step:\n**1. Express both sides with the same base:**\n*  We know that 256 is a power of 2:  256 = 2\u2078\n* Substitute:  2\u00b2\u02e3 = (2\u2078)\u00b9/\u00b2\n**2. Simplify the right side using exponent rules:**\n* (a\u1d50)\u207f = a\u1d50\u207f\n* 2\u00b2\u02e3 = 2\u2078*\u00b9/\u00b2\n* 2\u00b2\u02e3 = 2\u2074\n**3.  Equate the exponents:**\n* Since the bases are the same, we can equate the exponents:\n* 2x = 4\n**4. Solve for x:**\n* Divide both sides by 2:\n* x = 2\n**Therefore, the solution to the equation is x = 2.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve for *x* step-by-step:\n1. **Simplify the right side:**  Notice that 256 is a power of 2 (256 = 2\u2078).
