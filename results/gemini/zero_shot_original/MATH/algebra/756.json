    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let $f$ be the number of free hours per month, and let $c$ be the cost for each extra hour, in dollars.  Wells and Ted together have $2f$ free hours, so they used $105-2f$ extra hours.  Since the cost for each extra hour is $c$ dollars, we are given $c(105-2f)=10$.  Similarly, Vino's bill implies $c(105-f)=26$.  Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we find $fc=16$.  Rewrite the second equation as $105c-fc=26$, substitute 16 for $fc$, and solve to get $c=2/5$.  Two-fifths of a dollar is $\\boxed{40}$ cents.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the cost per extra hour for Vino:**\n* Vino used 105 hours and paid $26.\n* Since he used all his free hours, the $26 represents the cost of the extra hours.\n**2. Figure out the cost per extra hour:**\n* Divide the total cost for Vino by the number of extra hours he used: $26 / 105 hours = $0.248 per hour (approximately).\n**3. Convert the cost to cents:**\n* Multiply the cost per hour in dollars by 100 to get the cost in cents: $0.248 x 100 = 24.8 cents per hour.\n**4. Round to the nearest whole cent:**\n* The cost per extra hour is approximately **25 cents**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Figure out Vino's extra hours:**\n* Vino paid $26, and each extra hour costs the same amount.  We need to figure out how many extra hours he used.\n**2. Determine the cost per extra hour:**\n* Since Vino's extra hours are the only ones that were charged, we can divide his total cost by his extra hours to find the cost per hour.\n**3. Calculate the cost in cents:**\n*  Multiply the cost per hour (in dollars) by 100 to convert it to cents.\n**Let's work it out:**\n* **Vino's free hours:**  We don't know how many free hours Vino has, but we know he used 105 hours total. Since Wells and Ted used 105 hours together and they both used all their free hours, Vino must have used at least as many free hours as both of them combined.  Therefore, Vino's extra hours are less than 105.\n* **Finding the cost per extra hour:**  We know Vino paid $26.  Let's assume he used 'x' extra hours. This means the cost per extra hour is $26 / x.\n* **Converting to cents:** Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, the cost per extra hour in cents is (26 / x) * 100 cents.\n**To get a specific answer, we need to know how many free hours Vino has.**  We can then determine his extra hours and calculate the cost per extra hour in cents. \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Figure out Vino's extra hours:**\n* Vino used 105 hours and paid $26.  \n* This means he used some free hours and then extra hours that were charged.\n* Since he paid $26, and we know each extra hour costs the same amount, let's figure out how many extra hours he used.\n**2. Calculate the cost per extra hour:**\n* We need to figure out how many cents are in $26: $26 * 100 cents/$1 = 2600 cents.\n* Let's say Vino used 'x' extra hours. We know the cost per extra hour is the same for everyone.  So, the cost of his extra hours is 'x' * (cost per extra hour).\n* We know this cost is 2600 cents. \n**3. Determine the cost per extra hour:**\n* Let's represent the cost per extra hour as 'c'.  \n* We know Vino paid 2600 cents for 'x' extra hours, so: x * c = 2600\n* To find the cost per extra hour (c), we need to know how many extra hours (x) Vino used.\n**4. Use the information about Wells and Ted:**\n* We know Wells and Ted together used 105 hours and paid $10. \n* We don't know how many free hours each of them had. \n* However, we know that they used *all* their free hours, so the $10 they paid is *only* for extra hours.\n* This means they used a combined total of 'y' extra hours, and y * c = 1000 cents ($10).\n**5.  We have two equations now:**\n*  x * c = 2600\n*  y * c = 1000\n**6.  The Problem:**\n* We have two equations, but three unknowns (x, y, and c).  We can't solve for c directly. We need more information. \n**Conclusion:**\nWe don't have enough information to determine the cost per extra hour. We need to know either the number of extra hours Vino used or the number of extra hours Wells and Ted used together. \n",

Figure out the cost per hour for Vino:**\n* Vino used 105 hours and paid $26.\n* Since he used all his free hours, the $26 represents only the cost of the extra hours.\n* Cost per extra hour for Vino: $26 / 105 hours = $0.2476 per hour (approximately).\n**2. Figure out the cost for Wells and Ted's extra hours:**\n* We know their total cost for extra hours was $10.\n* Since they both used all their free hours, this entire $10 represents the cost of extra hours.\n**3.  Find the total number of extra hours used by Wells and Ted:**\n* We need to find the number of extra hours they used beyond their free hours.  However, we don't know how many free hours each person gets.  \n**4.  We're stuck!**  We can't find the cost per extra hour for Wells and Ted because we don't know how many hours they used beyond their free allowance. \n**Conclusion:**\nWe can only determine the cost per extra hour for Vino.

        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Figure out Vino's extra hours:**\n* Vino used 105 hours and paid $26.  \n* Since he paid, this means he used more than his free hours.\n**2.  Determine the cost per extra hour for Vino:**\n* We need to find out how many extra hours Vino used. Let's say he had 'x' free hours. \n* He used 105 hours total, so he used (105 - x) extra hours.\n* We know his total cost was $26.  \n**3. Set up an equation:**\n* Let 'y' represent the cost per extra hour. \n* The equation to represent Vino's cost is: y * (105 - x) = 26\n**4.  Focus on Wells and Ted:**\n* Wells and Ted together used 105 hours and spent $10. \n* This means they each used all their free hours, and the $10 represents the cost for their extra hours.\n* Since they both used the same amount of free hours, they both used the same number of extra hours.\n**5.  Relate Wells and Ted to Vino:**\n* Since Wells and Ted together used 105 hours, and they each used the same number of extra hours, each of them used 105/2 = 52.5 hours. \n*  This means they each used 52.5 - x extra hours.\n**6.  Set up another equation:**\n*  The equation to represent their combined cost is: 2 * y * (52.5 - x) = 10\n**7.  Solve for 'y':**\n* We now have two equations with two unknowns:\n    * y * (105 - x) = 26\n    * 2 * y * (52.5 - x) = 10\n* We can simplify the second equation to: y * (52.5 - x) = 5\n* Now, we have two equations with the same structure.  We can solve for 'y' by dividing the first equation by the second equation:\n    * [y * (105 - x)] / [y * (52.5 - x)] = 26 / 5\n    * Simplifying, we get: (105 - x) / (52.5 - x) = 5.2 \n    * Cross-multiplying: 105 - x = 273 - 5.2x\n    * Combining like terms: 4.2x = 168\n    * Solving for x: x = 40\n* Now that we know 'x', we can substitute it back into either of our original equations to find 'y'.  Let's use the first equation:\n    * y * (105 - 40) = 26\n    * y * 65 = 26\n    * y = 26 / 65\n    * y = 0.4\n**8.  Convert to cents:**\n* Since 'y' represents the cost per extra hour in dollars, we need to convert it to cents: \n    * y = 0.4 dollars = 40 cents\n**Answer:** The cost of each extra hour is **40 cents**. \n"
