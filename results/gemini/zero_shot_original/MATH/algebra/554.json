        "Here's how to evaluate the expression step-by-step:\n1. **Absolute Value:**  The absolute value of a number is its distance from zero, always positive.  Therefore,  \n   \n   ```\n   | -23/9 | = 23/9 \n   ```\n2. **Floor Function:** The floor function, denoted by  \u230a \u230b, gives the greatest integer less than or equal to the input. Since 23/9 is between 2 and 3,  \n   \n   ```\n   \u230a 23/9 \u230b = 2 \n   ```\n**Therefore,  $\\left\\lfloor\\left|-\\frac{23}{9}\\right|\\right\\rfloor = 2$.** \n",
