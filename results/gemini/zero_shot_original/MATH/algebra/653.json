    "problem": "Two bricklayers, Alan and David, each place 30 bricks per hour. Alan worked three times as many hours as David, and the two of them placed a total of 600 bricks. How many bricks did David lay?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let $t$ equal the amount of time David worked. Therefore, Alan worked $3t$ hours. They placed a total of $30 \\cdot t +30 \\cdot 3t=600$ bricks. Solving for $t$, we find that $t=5$ hours. Therefore, David placed $30 \\cdot 5 = \\boxed{150}$ bricks.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Define Variables:**\n* Let 'x' represent the number of hours David worked.\n* Alan worked three times as many hours as David, so he worked 3x hours.\n**2. Calculate Total Bricks Laid:**\n* David laid x hours * 30 bricks/hour = 30x bricks\n* Alan laid 3x hours * 30 bricks/hour = 90x bricks\n**3. Set Up an Equation:**\n* The total bricks laid is 600, so: 30x + 90x = 600\n**4. Solve for x:**\n* Combine like terms: 120x = 600\n* Divide both sides by 120: x = 5 \n**5. Find the Number of Bricks David Laid:**\n* David laid 30 bricks/hour * 5 hours = 150 bricks\n**Answer:** David laid 150 bricks. \n",

Set up an equation:**\n* We know they laid a total of 600 bricks: 120x = 600\n**4. Solve for x:**\n* Divide both sides by 120: x = 5 hours (This is how many hours David worked)\n**5. Calculate the number of bricks David laid:**\n* David laid 5 hours * 30 bricks/hour = 150 bricks\n**Answer:** David laid 150 bricks. \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Define Variables:**\n* Let 'x' represent the number of hours David worked.\n* Alan worked three times as long, so he worked 3x hours.\n**2. Set up Equations:**\n* **Bricks laid by David:** x hours * 30 bricks/hour = 30x bricks\n* **Bricks laid by Alan:** 3x hours * 30 bricks/hour = 90x bricks\n* **Total bricks:** 30x + 90x = 600\n**3.
