        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Calculate the interest earned in the first year:**\n* Interest rate: 4.5% = 0.045 (as a decimal)\n* Principal: $10,000\n* Interest earned in the first year: $10,000 * 0.045 = $450\n**2. Calculate the new principal at the beginning of the second year:**\n* Original principal: $10,000\n* Interest earned in the first year: $450\n* New principal: $10,000 + $450 = $10,450\n**3. Calculate the interest earned in the second year:**\n* Interest rate: 4.5% = 0.045 (as a decimal)\n* Principal: $10,450\n* Interest earned in the second year: $10,450 * 0.045 = $470.25\n**4. Calculate the total interest earned over two years:**\n* Interest earned in the first year: $450\n* Interest earned in the second year: $470.25\n* Total interest earned: $450 + $470.25 = $920.25\n**Answer:** The total interest earned in two years is **$920.25**. \n",
