        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Analyze the denominator:**\nThe denominator of the expression is  5x - 10.  Notice that this can be factored: 5x - 10 = 5(x - 2). \n**2. Identify the excluded value:**\nThe denominator cannot be zero.  Therefore, x cannot equal 2. This is why the problem states  x \u2260 2.\n**3. Determine the unreachable value:**\nAs x gets closer and closer to 2, the denominator gets closer and closer to zero.  This means the fraction will become either extremely large (positive or negative) depending on whether x is slightly larger or slightly smaller than 2. \nLet's consider what happens as x approaches 2 from the right (x > 2):\n* The numerator (x - 4) approaches -2.\n* The denominator (5x - 10) approaches 0 (but is always positive).\nThis means the entire fraction becomes increasingly large and negative.\nSimilarly, as x approaches 2 from the left (x < 2):\n* The numerator (x - 4) approaches -2.\n* The denominator (5x - 10) approaches 0 (but is always negative).\nThis means the entire fraction becomes increasingly large and positive.\n**4. Conclusion:**\nSince the fraction approaches positive or negative infinity as x approaches 2, there is no way for the expression to ever equal **0**.  \n**Therefore, the value of *y* that is not attainable is  0/1 or simply  0.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Analyze the denominator:**\nThe denominator of the expression is  5x - 10.  This denominator cannot be equal to zero, because division by zero is undefined.\n**2. Find the excluded value:**\nSet the denominator equal to zero and solve for x:\n5x - 10 = 0\n5x = 10\nx = 2\nThis means that x cannot be equal to 2.\n**3. Determine the unattainable y-value:**\nAs x approaches 2, the denominator of the expression approaches zero.  This means the value of the expression gets increasingly large (either positive or negative).  \n* If x approaches 2 from the left (values slightly less than 2), the denominator is negative, and the expression approaches negative infinity.\n* If x approaches 2 from the right (values slightly greater than 2), the denominator is positive, and the expression approaches positive infinity.\nTherefore, the value of y that is not attainable is **y = 0**.  \n**Conclusion:**\nFor the given expression, the value of *y* that is not attainable is **0**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Analyze the denominator:**\nThe denominator of the fraction is 5x - 10.  We are given that x \u2260 2. This means the denominator can never be equal to zero.\n**2.  Consider what happens when the denominator is zero:**\nIf the denominator were to be zero, the fraction would be undefined.  This is because division by zero is not allowed.\n**3.  Find the value of y that makes the denominator zero:**\nSet the denominator equal to zero and solve for x:\n  5x - 10 = 0\n  5x = 10\n  x = 2\n**4.  Determine the unattainable value of y:**\nSince x = 2 is the value that would make the denominator zero, we need to find the corresponding value of y. Substitute x = 2 into the original equation:\n  y = (2 - 4) / (5 * 2 - 10) \n  y = -2 / 0\nThis shows that when x approaches 2, the value of y becomes extremely large (positive or negative) and is undefined.\n**Answer:**\nTherefore, the value of y that is not attainable is **undefined**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the problem:**\nWe're given a rational function,  $y = \\frac{x-4}{5x-10}$.  We need to find a value of *y* that the function *cannot* produce, given the restriction that *x* cannot be 2.\n**2. Analyze the denominator:**\nThe denominator, 5x-10, is zero when x = 2.  This means the function is undefined at x = 2.  Since we're given that x \u2260 2, we know the function is defined everywhere else.\n**3.  Consider the denominator's impact on the function:**\nAs *x* approaches 2, the denominator gets very close to zero.  This means the fraction becomes very large (either positive or negative, depending on whether *x* is slightly less than or greater than 2).  We say that the function has a **vertical asymptote** at x = 2.\n**4. Determine the unattainable value of y:**\nSince the function becomes infinitely large as *x* approaches 2, there's a value of *y* that the function can never reach. This value is the **horizontal asymptote**.  To find it, we can simplify the function:\n* Factor a 5 out of the denominator:  \n   $y = \\frac{x-4}{5(x-2)}$\n* Notice that the function has the same degree (highest power of *x*) in the numerator and denominator.  This means the horizontal asymptote is the ratio of the leading coefficients:\n* The leading coefficient in the numerator is 1, and the leading coefficient in the denominator is 5.  Therefore, the horizontal asymptote is **y = 1/5**.\n**Answer:** The value of *y* that is not attainable is **1/5**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Understand the Concept of Unattainable Values**\nAn unattainable value for a function is a value that the function can never output, no matter what input you choose.  This often happens when there's a restriction in the function's definition, such as a denominator that can't be zero.\n**2. Identify the Restriction**\nIn the function  $y = \\frac{x-4}{5x-10}$, the denominator cannot be zero.  So, we need to find the value of *x* that makes the denominator zero:\n* 5x - 10 = 0\n* 5x = 10\n* x = 2\nNotice that the problem explicitly states that *x* cannot be 2. This is because if *x* were 2, the function would be undefined.\n**3. Determine the Unattainable Value**\nNow, let's see what happens to the function as *x* gets very close to 2:\n* As *x* approaches 2 from the left (values slightly less than 2), the denominator (5x - 10) becomes a very small negative number. This makes the entire fraction a very large negative number.\n* As *x* approaches 2 from the right (values slightly greater than 2), the denominator becomes a very small positive number. This makes the entire fraction a very large positive number.\nSince the function becomes infinitely large (positive or negative) as *x* gets closer to 2, it can never actually reach a specific finite value. Therefore, the value *y* = **0** is not attainable.\n**Answer:** The value of *y* that is not attainable is **0**. \n"
