    "problem": "There is a total of 20 quarters stacked in four piles. The first pile has 3 fewer than the second pile. The second pile has 2 more than the third pile. The fourth pile has twice as many as the second pile. How many quarters are in the fourth pile?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let the number of quarters in the first, second, third, and fourth piles be $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$, respectively. We have the equations \\begin{align*} \\tag{1}\na+b+c+d&=20\\\\ \\tag{2}\na&=b-3\\\\ \\tag{3}\nb&=c+2\\\\ \\tag{4}\nd&=2b\n\\end{align*} We want to find the value of $d$. We will express each of $a$, $b$, and $c$ in terms of $d$ and then substitute these equations into Equation (1) to find the value of $d$. From Equation (4), we have $b=d/2$. From Equation (3), we have $c=b-2$. Since $b=d/2$, we can rewrite Equation (3) as $c=d/2-2$. We can substitute $b=d/2$ into Equation (2) to get $a=d/2-3$. Substituting $b=d/2$, $c=d/2-2$, and $a=d/2-3$ into Equation (1) to eliminate $a$, $b$, and $c$, we get $(d/2-3)+d/2+(d/2-2)+d=20$, so $d=10$. Thus, there are $\\boxed{10}$ quarters in the fourth pile.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Define Variables:**\n* Let  'x' represent the number of quarters in the third pile.\n**2. Express the Other Piles in Terms of 'x':**\n* **Second Pile:**  x + 2 \n* **First Pile:** (x + 2) - 3 = x - 1\n* **Fourth Pile:** 2 * (x + 2) = 2x + 4\n**3. Set up an Equation:**\nThe total number of quarters in all four piles is 20. So:\n(x - 1) + (x + 2) + x + (2x + 4) = 20\n**4. Solve for 'x':**\n* Combine like terms: 5x + 5 = 20\n* Subtract 5 from both sides: 5x = 15\n* Divide both sides by 5: x = 3\n**5.
