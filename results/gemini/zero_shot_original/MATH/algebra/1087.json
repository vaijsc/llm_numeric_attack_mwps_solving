    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We have $g(4) = \\sqrt{2(4) + 1} = \\sqrt{9} = 3$, so $f(g(4)) = f(3) = 3^2 -2(3) +1 = 4$.  Since $f(3) = 4$, we have $g(f(3)) = g(4) = \\sqrt{2(4) + 1} = 3$.  Therefore, $f(g(4)) -g(f(3)) = 4-3 = \\boxed{1}$.\n\n\nNotice that $f(g(4)) = 4$ and $g(f(3)) = 3$.  Is that a coincidence?",
