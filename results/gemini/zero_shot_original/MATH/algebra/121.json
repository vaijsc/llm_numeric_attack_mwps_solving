    "solution": "The radius of the larger circle is given by the distance formula to be $\\sqrt{(6-(-1))^2 + (1-0)^2} = \\sqrt{49 + 1} = 5\\sqrt{2}$. The distance between the centers of the two circles is given by the distance formula to be $\\sqrt{(-3-0)^2 + (2-(-1))^2} = \\sqrt{3^2 + 3^2} = 3\\sqrt{2}$. Thus, the radius of the smaller circle is equal to $5\\sqrt{2} - 3\\sqrt{2} = 2\\sqrt{2}$, and the square of the radius is $8$. The equation of the smaller circle is given by $$(x+3)^2+(y-2)^2 = 8 \\Longrightarrow x^2 + y^2 + 6x - 4y + 5 = 0.$$ So $D+E+F=6 - 4 + 5 = \\boxed{7}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Relationship Between the Circles**\nSince the circles are internally tangent, the distance between their centers is equal to the difference of their radii.  The distance between the centers is:\n```\n\u221a[(0 - (-3))^2 + (-1 - 2)^2] = \u221a(3^2 + 3^2) = 3\u221a2\n```\nLet the radius of the smaller circle be *r*.  Then the radius of the larger circle is *r + 3\u221a2*.\n**2. Use the Standard Form of a Circle**\nThe general equation of a circle with center (h, k) and radius *r* is:\n```\n(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\n```\nThe smaller circle is centered at (-3, 2), so its equation is:\n```\n(x + 3)^2 + (y - 2)^2 = r^2\n```\n**3.  Expand the Equation**\nExpand the equation to match the form  *x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0*:\n```\nx^2 + 6x + 9 + y^2 - 4y + 4 = r^2\nx^2 + y^2 + 6x - 4y + 13 = r^2\n```\n**4. Use the Relationship Between Radii**\nWe know the radius of the larger circle is *r + 3\u221a2*.  Its center is at (0, -1).  So, its equation is:\n```\n(x - 0)^2 + (y + 1)^2 = (r + 3\u221a2)^2\nx^2 + y^2 + 2y = r^2 + 6\u221a2r + 18 \n```\n**5.  Solve for *r***\nNow we have two equations:\n* Equation 1: *x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 6x - 4y + 13 = r\u00b2*\n* Equation 2: *x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2y = r\u00b2 + 6\u221a2r + 18*\nSubtract Equation 1 from Equation 2 to eliminate *x\u00b2* and *y\u00b2*:\n```\n6x - 6y + 5 = 6\u221a2r + 5\n6x - 6y = 6\u221a2r\nx - y = \u221a2r\n```\nWe can use the point (1, 6) on the smaller circle to find *r*:\n```\n1 - 6 = \u221a2r\n-5 = \u221a2r\nr = -5/\u221a2 \n```\n**6.  Find D, E, and F**\nSubstitute the value of *r* back into the equation for the smaller circle:\n```\nx^2 + y^2 + 6x - 4y + 13 = (-5/\u221a2)^2\nx^2 + y^2 + 6x - 4y + 13 = 25/2\nx^2 + y^2 + 6x - 4y + 1/2 = 0\n```\nTherefore, D = 6, E = -4, and F = 1/2.\n**7. Calculate D + E + F**\nFinally, \n```\nD + E + F = 6 - 4 + 1/2 = **2.5** \n``` \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Concept of Internal Tangency**\nTwo circles are internally tangent if they touch at a single point and the smaller circle lies completely inside the larger circle.  This means the distance between their centers is equal to the difference of their radii.\n**2. Find the Radius of the Smaller Circle**\n* The distance between the centers of the circles is the distance between (-3, 2) and (0, -1).

Substitute Values for the Smaller Circle**\n* Center of the smaller circle: (-3, 2)\n* Radius of the smaller circle: 7.07 - 3\u221a2\nSubstitute these values into the standard form:\n(x + 3)\u00b2 + (y - 2)\u00b2 = (7.07 - 3\u221a2)\u00b2\n**5. Expand and Rearrange**\n* Expand the squares:\n   x\u00b2 + 6x + 9 + y\u00b2 - 4y + 4 = 50 - 42\u221a2 + 18\n* Combine like terms:\n   x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 6x - 4y - 25 + 42\u221a2 = 0\n**6. Identify D, E, and F**\nThe equation of the smaller circle is now in the form x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0.  We can see that:\n* D = 6\n* E = -4\n* F = -25 + 42\u221a2\n**7.

Find D + E + F**\nComparing this to the given form x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0, we see:\n* D = 6\n* E = -4\n* F = -19\nTherefore, D + E + F = 6 - 4 - 19 = **-17**. \n",
