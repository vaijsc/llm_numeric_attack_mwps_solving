Understand the Midpoint Formula**\nThe midpoint of a line segment is the average of the x-coordinates and the average of the y-coordinates of the endpoints.  \n**2. Set up the Equations**\nLet the other endpoint be (x, y). Using the midpoint formula:\n*  (1) = (6 + x) / 2  (The x-coordinate of the midpoint)\n*  (1) = (8 + y) / 2  (The y-coordinate of the midpoint)\n**3.
