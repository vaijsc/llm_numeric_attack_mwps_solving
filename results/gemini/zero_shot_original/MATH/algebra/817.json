    "solution": "Since point $A$ is constrained to a rectangular region with sides parallel to the axes, its $x$ and $y$ coordinates can be chosen independently of one another.  The same is true of point $B$.  Therefore, the horizontal separation between $A$ and $B$ should be minimized and the vertical separation maximized.  The greatest possible $y$-coordinate for $B$ is 3 and the least possible $y$-coordinate for $A$ is 0.  The greatest possible $x$-coordinate for $A$ is 2 and the least possible $x$-coordinate for $B$ is 4. Therefore, the slope between $A$ and $B$ is maximized when $A$ has coordinates (2,0) and $B$ has coordinates (4,3).  The maximum slope is $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Squares**\nImagine the two squares.  The first square has vertices at (0,0), (2,0), (2,2), and (0,2). The second square has vertices at (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), and (4,3).\n**2. Maximize the Slope**\nTo maximize the slope of line AB, we want to place point A as low as possible and point B as high as possible. \n* **Point A:**  Place point A at the bottom left corner of its square, (0,0).\n* **Point B:** Place point B at the top right corner of its square, (5,3).\n**3. Calculate the Slope**\nThe slope of a line passing through points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by:\nslope = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\nUsing our points A (0,0) and B (5,3), we get:\nslope = (3 - 0) / (5 - 0) = **3/5**\n**Therefore, the greatest possible value of the slope of line AB is 3/5.** \n",
        "To maximize the slope of line AB, we want point A to be as low and far left as possible, and point B to be as high and far right as possible.\n* **Point A:** The lowest and furthest left point A can be is at (0,0).\n* **Point B:** The highest and furthest right point B can be is at (5,3).\nNow, we have the points A(0,0) and B(5,3).  The slope of line AB is:\n```\nslope = (change in y) / (change in x) = (3 - 0) / (5 - 0) = 3/5\n```\nTherefore, the greatest possible value of the slope of line AB is **3/5**. \n",
        "To maximize the slope of line $AB$, we want to place $A$ at the point within the first square that is furthest from the line $x=4$ (the line that contains the left side of the second square).  This point is $(2,0)$.  Similarly, we want to place $B$ at the point within the second square that is furthest from the line $x=2$.

Maximize the Slope**\nTo maximize the slope of line AB, we need to find the points A and B that are furthest apart vertically and as close as possible horizontally.\n* **Point A:** Place point A at the top-left corner of Square 1, at (0,2).\n* **Point B:** Place point B at the bottom-right corner of Square 2, at (5,2).\n**3. Calculate the Slope**\nThe slope of line AB is given by:\n```\nSlope = (change in y) / (change in x) = (2 - 2) / (5 - 0) = 0 / 5 = 0\n```\n**4.  Consider Other Possibilities**\nWhile we've found a slope of 0, we need to make sure this is the *greatest* possible slope.  Could we get a positive slope?\n* Notice that point B *must* be within or on Square 2.  If we move B upward, its y-coordinate increases, but its x-coordinate stays the same or decreases. This will result in a slope that is either 0 or negative.\n**5. Conclusion**\nThe greatest possible value of the slope of line AB is **0**. \n",
