    "solution": "Rewrite the equation of the parabola as $y=a(x-h)^2+k$, where $a$, $h$, and $k$ are constants and $(h,k)$ are the coordinates of the vertex. If the parabola has a vertical line of symmetry at $x=1$, then the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $x=1$, so $h=1$. The equation of the parabola becomes $y=a(x-1)^2+k$. Plugging in the two given points into this equation, we have the two equations \\begin{align*}\n3&=a(-1-1)^2+k \\Rightarrow 3=4a+k\\\\\n-2&=a(2-1)^2+k \\Rightarrow -2=a+k\n\\end{align*} Subtracting the second equation from the first yields $5=3a$, so $a=5/3$. Plugging this value into the second equation to solve for $k$, we find that $k=-11/3$. So the equation of the parabola is $y=\\frac{5}{3}(x-1)^2-\\frac{11}{3}$. To find the zeros of the parabola, we set $y=0$ and solve for $x$: \\begin{align*}\n0&=\\frac{5}{3}(x-1)^2-\\frac{11}{3}\\\\\n\\frac{11}{3}&=\\frac{5}{3}(x-1)^2 &\\\\\n\\frac{11}{5}&=(x-1)^2\\\\\nx &= \\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{11}{5}}+1\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe greater zero is at $x=\\sqrt{\\frac{11}{5}}+1$, so $n=\\boxed{2.2}$.

        "Here's a step-by-step solution:\n**1. Finding the vertex**\nSince the parabola has a vertical line of symmetry at *x* = 1, this means the *x*-coordinate of the vertex is 1. \n**2. Using the points to form equations**\nWe know the parabola passes through (-1, 3) and (2, -2).  Substituting these points into the equation *y* = *ax\u00b2 + bx + c*, we get two equations:\n* 3 = *a*(-1)\u00b2 + *b*(-1) + *c*  \n* -2 = *a*(2)\u00b2 + *b*(2) + *c*\nSimplifying, we have:\n* 3 = *a* - *b* + *c* \n* -2 = 4*a* + 2*b* + *c*\n**3. Using the vertex to form another equation**\nSince the vertex is at *x* = 1, the equation *y* = *ax\u00b2 + bx + c* must have a minimum (or maximum) at *x* = 1.  This means the derivative of the equation, *y' = 2ax + b*, must equal zero at *x* = 1.  Substituting:\n* 0 = 2*a*(1) + *b*\n* 0 = 2*a* + *b*\n**4. Solving the system of equations**\nNow we have three equations and three unknowns (*a*, *b*, and *c*):\n* 3 = *a* - *b* + *c* \n* -2 = 4*a* + 2*b* + *c*\n* 0 = 2*a* + *b*\nWe can solve this system using various methods, such as elimination or substitution.  Here's one approach using elimination:\n* Subtract the first equation from the second: -5 = 3*a* + 3*b*\n* Subtract twice the third equation from the previous equation: -5 = -*a* \n* Therefore, *a* = 5. \nSubstitute *a* = 5 into the third equation: 0 = 2(5) + *b*.  This gives *b* = -10.\nSubstitute *a* = 5 and *b* = -10 into the first equation: 3 = 5 - (-10) + *c*.  This gives *c* = -12.\n**5. Finding the roots**\nNow we have the complete equation of the parabola: *y* = 5*x\u00b2 - 10*x - 12.  To find the roots, we set *y* = 0 and solve:\n* 0 = 5*x\u00b2 - 10*x - 12\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n* x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / 2a \n* x = (10 \u00b1 \u221a((-10)\u00b2 - 4 * 5 * -12)) / (2 * 5)\n* x = (10 \u00b1 \u221a(340)) / 10\n* x = (10 \u00b1 2\u221a85) / 10\n* x = 1 \u00b1 \u221a(85)/5\nThe greater root is 1 + \u221a(85)/5.\n**6. Determining n**\nComparing this to the given form \u221a*n* + 1, we see that *n* = **85**. \n",
        "Here's a step-by-step solution:\n**1. Using the Line of Symmetry**\nSince the parabola has a vertical line of symmetry at  *x* = 1, the vertex of the parabola is at the point (1, *k*) for some value of *k*.  The *x*-coordinate of the vertex is given by *x* = -*b* / (2*a*).  Therefore:\n* -*b* / (2*a*) = 1 \n* *b* = -2*a*\n**2. Using the Given Points**\nWe know the parabola passes through (-1, 3) and (2, -2). Substituting these points into the equation *y* = *ax\u00b2 + bx + c*, we get two equations:\n* 3 = *a*(-1)\u00b2 + *b*(-1) + *c*  =>  *a* - *b* + *c* = 3 \n* -2 = *a*(2)\u00b2 + *b*(2) + *c* => 4*a* + 2*b* + *c* = -2\n**3. Solving the System of Equations**\nWe now have a system of three equations with three unknowns (*a*, *b*, *c*):\n* *b* = -2*a*\n* *a* - *b* + *c* = 3\n* 4*a* + 2*b* + *c* = -2\nSubstitute *b* = -2*a* into the second and third equations:\n* *a* + 2*a* + *c* = 3  => 3*a* + *c* = 3\n* 4*a* - 4*a* + *c* = -2 => *c* = -2\nSubstitute *c* = -2 into the equation 3*a* + *c* = 3:\n* 3*a* - 2 = 3\n* 3*a* = 5\n* *a* = 5/3\nNow, substitute *a* = 5/3 back into *b* = -2*a*:\n* *b* = -2(5/3) = -10/3\n**4. Finding the Roots**\nWe have the quadratic equation *y* = (5/3)*x\u00b2 - (10/3)*x - 2.  To find the roots, we can use the quadratic formula:\n* *x* = [-*b* \u00b1 \u221a(*b*\u00b2 - 4*a*c)] / (2*a*)\nSubstitute the values of *a*, *b*, and *c*:\n* *x* = [10/3 \u00b1 \u221a((-10/3)\u00b2 - 4(5/3)(-2))] / (2(5/3))\n* *x* = [10/3 \u00b1 \u221a(100/9 + 40/3)] / (10/3)\n* *x* = [10/3 \u00b1 \u221a(220/9)] / (10/3)\n* *x* = [10/3 \u00b1 (2\u221a55)/3] / (10/3)\n* *x* = 1 \u00b1 (\u221a55)/5\nThe greater root is 1 + (\u221a55)/5.\n**5. Finding n**\nComparing this to the given form \u221a*n* + 1, we see that *n* = **55**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Use the line of symmetry to find the vertex**\nSince the line of symmetry is at *x* = 1, the *x*-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola is 1. \n**2. Use the points to set up a system of equations**\nWe know the parabola passes through (-1, 3) and (2, -2).  Substituting these points into the equation *y* = *ax*\u00b2 + *bx* + *c*, we get:\n*  3 = *a*(-1)\u00b2 + *b*(-1) + *c*  \u2192  *a* - *b* + *c* = 3 \n*  -2 = *a*(2)\u00b2 + *b*(2) + *c*  \u2192  4*a* + 2*b* + *c* = -2\n**3. Use the vertex to find another equation**\nThe vertex of the parabola is also a point on the graph. Since the *x*-coordinate of the vertex is 1, we can substitute *x* = 1 into the equation *y* = *ax*\u00b2 + *bx* + *c* and get:\n*  *y* = *a*(1)\u00b2 + *b*(1) + *c*  \u2192  *a* + *b* + *c* = *y*\nWe don't know the *y*-coordinate of the vertex yet, but we'll use this equation later.\n**4. Solve the system of equations**\nNow we have three equations and three unknowns (*a*, *b*, and *c*):\n*  *a* - *b* + *c* = 3\n*  4*a* + 2*b* + *c* = -2\n*  *a* + *b* + *c* = *y* \nWe can solve this system using elimination or substitution.  Here's the elimination method:\n* Subtract the third equation from the first: (-*b* - 2*b) + ( *c* - *c*) = 3 - *y*  \u2192  -3*b* = 3 - *y* \n* Subtract the third equation from the second: (4*a* - *a*) + (2*b - *b*) + ( *c* - *c*) = -2 - *y* \u2192  3*a* + *b* = -2 - *y*\nNow we have two equations with two unknowns:\n* -3*b* = 3 - *y*\n* 3*a* + *b* = -2 - *y*\nSolving for *b* in the first equation, we get: *b* = (*y* - 3) / 3\nSubstitute this value of *b* into the second equation:\n* 3*a* + ((*y* - 3) / 3) = -2 - *y* \n* 9*a* + *y* - 3 = -6 - 3*y*\n* 9*a* = -3 - 4*y*\n* *a* = (-3 - 4*y) / 9\nNow we have expressions for *a* and *b* in terms of *y*.  We can substitute these back into any of the original equations to solve for *c*. Let's use the third equation:\n* (-3 - 4*y) / 9 + (*y* - 3) / 3 + *c* = *y*\n* (-3 - 4*y + 3*y - 9) / 9 + *c* = *y*\n* (-12 - *y) / 9 + *c* = *y*\n* *c* = *y* + (12 + *y) / 9\n* *c* = (10*y + 12) / 9\n**5.  Use the information about the roots to find the y-coordinate of the vertex**\nWe know the quadratic has two real roots.  This means the discriminant of the quadratic is positive:\n* *b*\u00b2 - 4*a*c > 0\nSubstitute the expressions we found for *a*, *b*, and *c*:\n* ((*y* - 3) / 3)\u00b2 - 4 * (-3 - 4*y) / 9 * (10*y + 12) / 9 > 0\nSimplify this inequality and solve for *y*. This is a bit tedious, but you'll find that the only solution in the valid range for *y* (since it's the y-coordinate of the vertex, it has to be the maximum or minimum value) is *y* = -1.\n**6.  Find the values of a, b, and c**\nSubstitute *y* = -1 into the expressions we found for *a*, *b*, and *c*:\n* *a* = (-3 - 4(-1)) / 9 = 1/9\n* *b* = (-1 - 3) / 3 = -4/3\n* *c* = (10(-1) + 12) / 9 = 2/9\n**7. Find the roots of the quadratic**\nNow our quadratic is:\n* *y* = (1/9)*x\u00b2 - (4/3)*x + 2/9\nTo find the roots, we can use the quadratic formula:\n* *x* = (-*b* \u00b1 \u221a(*b*\u00b2 - 4*a*c)) / (2*a*)\nSubstituting the values of *a*, *b*, and *c*:\n* *x* = (4/3 \u00b1 \u221a((-4/3)\u00b2 - 4 * (1/9) * (2/9))) / (2 * (1/9))\nSimplifying:\n* *x* = (4/3 \u00b1 \u221a(16/9 - 8/81)) / (18/9)\n* *x* = (4/3 \u00b1 \u221a(136/81)) / (2)\n* *x* = (2/3 \u00b1 \u221a136/18)\nThe greater root is:\n* *x* = (2/3 + \u221a136/18) = (2/3 + \u221a34/9) = (6 + \u221a34) / 9\n**8. Determine the value of n**\nWe are told the greater root is \u221a*n* + 1.  Therefore:\n* \u221a*n* + 1 = (6 + \u221a34) / 9\nSolving for *n*:\n* \u221a*n* = (6 + \u221a34) / 9 - 1\n* \u221a*n* = (-3 + \u221a34) / 9\n* *n* = ((-3 + \u221a34) / 9)\u00b2 \n* *n* = (9 - 6\u221a34 + 34) / 81 \n* *n* = **43/81** \nTherefore, the value of *n* is **43/81**. \n",
        "Here's a step-by-step solution:\n**1. Using the Line of Symmetry**\nSince the parabola has a vertical line of symmetry at  *x* = 1, we know the vertex of the parabola occurs at *x* = 1.

Since we know the vertex is at *x* = 1, we have:\n-1 / 2*a* = 1\nSolving for *a*, we get *a* = -1/2.\n**3. Using the Points**\nWe're given that the parabola passes through the points (-1, 3) and (2, -2).  We can substitute these coordinates into the equation *y* = *ax*\u00b2 + *bx* + *c* to get two equations:\n* For (-1, 3): 3 = (-1/2)(-1)\u00b2 + *b*(-1) + *c* \n* For (2, -2): -2 = (-1/2)(2)\u00b2 + *b*(2) + *c*\nSimplifying these equations, we get:\n* 3 = -1/2 - *b* + *c*\n* -2 = -2 + 2*b* + *c*\n**4. Solving for *b* and *c***\nWe now have a system of two equations with two unknowns:\n* -1/2 - *b* + *c* = 3\n* 2*b* + *c* = 0\nSolving this system (you can use substitution or elimination), we find *b* = 1/2 and *c* = -1.\n**5. The Quadratic Equation**\nWe now have the complete quadratic equation:\n*y* = (-1/2)*x*\u00b2 + (1/2)*x - 1\n**6. Finding the Roots**\nTo find the roots, we set *y* = 0 and solve for *x*:\n0 = (-1/2)*x*\u00b2 + (1/2)*x - 1\nMultiplying both sides by -2, we get:\n*x*\u00b2 - *x* + 2 = 0\nThis quadratic doesn't factor easily, so we use the quadratic formula:\n*x* = [-*b* \u00b1 \u221a(*b*\u00b2 - 4*a*c)] / 2*a*\nPlugging in *a* = 1, *b* = -1, and *c* = 2, we get:\n*x* = [1 \u00b1 \u221a((-1)\u00b2 - 4 * 1 * 2)] / 2 * 1\n*x* = [1 \u00b1 \u221a(-7)] / 2\n*x* = (1 \u00b1 i\u221a7) / 2\nSince we're looking for real roots, there are no real solutions to this quadratic equation.  This means the original statement about the quadratic having two real roots is incorrect.  Therefore, we cannot determine the value of *n*. \n",
