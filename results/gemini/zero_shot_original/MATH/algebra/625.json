    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The volume is proportional to the square of the base radius and to the height, so if these have the same volume, their heights are inversely proportional to the square of the radii. This means that with a radius 1/3 as big as the first, the second cone has a height of $24\\left(\\frac1{1/3}\\right)^2=24\\cdot9=\\boxed{216}$ inches.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step by step:\n**1. Set up the volume equation:**\n* Let the radius of the smaller cone be *r*.\n* The radius of the larger cone is *3r*.\n* The height of the larger cone is 24 inches.\n* Let the height of the smaller cone be *h*.\nThe volume of the larger cone is: (1/3)\u03c0(3r)\u00b2(24) = 72\u03c0r\u00b2\nThe volume of the smaller cone is: (1/3)\u03c0r\u00b2h\n**2. Equate the volumes:**\nSince the cones have the same volume, we can set the two volume expressions equal to each other:\n72\u03c0r\u00b2 = (1/3)\u03c0r\u00b2h\n**3. Solve for *h*:**\n* Cancel out \u03c0r\u00b2 on both sides: 72 = (1/3)h\n* Multiply both sides by 3: 216 = h\n**Answer:** The smaller cone is **216 inches** tall. \n",
        "Let's break this problem down step by step:\n1. **Assign Variables:**\n   - Let the radius of the smaller cone be *r*.\n   - The radius of the larger cone is then *3r*. \n   - The height of the smaller cone is *h* (what we want to find).\n   - The height of the larger cone is 24 inches.\n2. **Set up the Volume Equation:**\n   -  The volume of the smaller cone is (1/3)\u03c0r\u00b2h\n   - The volume of the larger cone is (1/3)\u03c0(3r)\u00b2(24) = 72\u03c0r\u00b2\n3. **Equate the Volumes:**\n   - Since the volumes are equal, we have: (1/3)\u03c0r\u00b2h = 72\u03c0r\u00b2\n4. **Solve for *h*:**\n   - Divide both sides of the equation by (1/3)\u03c0r\u00b2:  h = 72\u03c0r\u00b2 / [(1/3)\u03c0r\u00b2] \n   - Simplify: h = 72 * 3 = 216\n**Therefore, the smaller cone is 216 inches tall.** \n",
