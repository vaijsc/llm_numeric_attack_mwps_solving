        "Here's how to solve this step-by-step:\n* **Year 1:** Alan earns 3% of $500, which is $500 * 0.03 = $15. His account has $500 + $15 = $515.\n* **Year 2:** Alan earns 3% of $515, which is $515 * 0.03 = $15.45. His account has $515 + $15.45 = $530.45. \n* **Year 3 to Year 10:** We can continue this process for each year, but it's easier to use the compound interest formula: \n    * A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)\n    * Where:\n        * A = the future value of the investment/loan, including interest\n        * P = the principal investment amount (the initial deposit or loan amount)\n        * r = the annual interest rate (as a decimal)\n        * n = the number of times that interest is compounded per year\n        * t = the number of years the money is invested or borrowed for\n* **Applying the formula:**\n    * A = $500 (1 + 0.03/1)^(1*10) \n    * A = $500 (1.03)^10\n    * A = $500 * 1.3439 \n    * A = $671.95\n**Therefore, after 10 years, Alan will have approximately $672 in his bank account.** \n",
