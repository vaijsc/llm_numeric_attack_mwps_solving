    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let $a$ be the first term, and let $d$ be the common difference.  Then the $n^{\\text{th}}$ term is $a + (n - 1)d$.  In particular, the second term is $a + d = 2$, and the ninth term is $a + 8d = 30$.  Subtracting these equations, we get $7d = 28$, so $d = 4$.  Substituting this into the equation $a + d = 2$, we get $a + 4 = 2$, so $a = -2$.\n\nThen the fiftieth term is $a + 49d = -2 + 49 \\cdot 4 = \\boxed{194}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand Arithmetic Sequences**\nAn arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers where the difference between any two consecutive terms is constant. This constant difference is called the common difference.\n**2. Set up the Equations**\n* Let 'a' be the first term of the sequence.\n* Let 'd' be the common difference.\nWe know the following:\n* The second term is 2:  a + d = 2 \n* The ninth term is 30: a + 8d = 30\n**3. Solve for 'a' and 'd'**\nWe have two equations and two unknowns, so we can solve for 'a' and 'd'.  Let's use the method of elimination:\n* Subtract the first equation from the second equation: \n   (a + 8d) - (a + d) = 30 - 2\n   7d = 28\n   d = 4\n* Substitute the value of 'd' back into either of the original equations to solve for 'a'. Let's use the first equation:\n   a + 4 = 2\n   a = -2\n**4. Find the Fiftieth Term**\nThe general formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is:\na_n = a + (n-1)d\nSubstitute the values we found for 'a', 'd', and 'n = 50':\na_50 = -2 + (50 - 1) * 4\na_50 = -2 + 196\na_50 = 194\n**Therefore, the fiftieth term of the arithmetic sequence is 194.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the common difference:**\n* An arithmetic sequence has a constant difference between consecutive terms. We call this the common difference (d).\n* The second term is 2 and the ninth term is 30, which means there are 7 terms between them.\n* The difference between the 9th term and the 2nd term is 30 - 2 = 28.\n* Since there are 7 terms in between, the common difference is 28 / 7 = 4.\n**2. Find the first term:**\n* Let 'a' be the first term of the sequence.\n* The second term is a + d, which we know is 2.\n* So, a + 4 = 2\n* Solving for 'a', we get a = -2.\n**3. Find the fiftieth term:**\n* The general formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is: a<sub>n</sub> = a + (n-1)d\n* We want to find the 50th term (a<sub>50</sub>)\n* Plugging in the values: a<sub>50</sub> = -2 + (50-1)4\n* Simplifying: a<sub>50</sub> = -2 + 196\n* Therefore, the fiftieth term is a<sub>50</sub> = 194.\n**Answer:** The fiftieth term of the arithmetic sequence is **194**. \n",
