    "solution": "The store's revenue is given by: number of books sold $\\times$ price of each book, or $p(128-4p)=128p-4p^2$. We want to maximize this expression by completing the square. We can factor out a $-4$ to get $-4(p^2-32p)$.\n\nTo complete the square, we add $(32/2)^2=256$ inside the parentheses and subtract $-4\\cdot256=-1024$ outside. We are left with the expression\n\\[-4(p^2-32p+256)+1024=-4(p-16)^2+1024.\\]Note that the $-4(p-16)^2$ term will always be nonpositive since the perfect square is always nonnegative. Thus, the revenue is maximized when $-4(p-16)^2$ equals 0, which is when $p=16$. Thus, the store should charge $\\boxed{16}$ dollars for the book.\n\nAlternatively, since the roots of $p(128-4p)$ are 0 and 32, symmetry tells us that the extreme value will be at $p=16$.  Since the coefficient on $p^2$ is negative, this is a maximum.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Define Revenue**\n* Revenue is the total income from selling the books. \n* Revenue = (Price per book) * (Number of books sold)\n**2. Set Up the Revenue Equation**\n* Let  `p` be the price of the book.\n* The number of books sold is `128 - 4p`.\n* Therefore, the revenue equation is:  `R(p) = p(128 - 4p)`\n**3. Simplify the Revenue Equation**\n*  `R(p) = 128p - 4p^2`\n**4. Find the Maximum Revenue**\n* The revenue equation is a quadratic function (shaped like a parabola). The maximum revenue occurs at the vertex of the parabola.\n* To find the vertex's x-coordinate (which represents the price `p` in this case), we use the formula:  `p = -b / 2a`, where `a` and `b` are the coefficients in the quadratic equation.\n* In our equation, `a = -4` and `b = 128`.\n**5. Calculate the Price**\n*  `p = -128 / (2 * -4) = 16`\n**6. Interpret the Result**\n* The bookstore should charge **$16** per book to maximize its revenue. \n",
