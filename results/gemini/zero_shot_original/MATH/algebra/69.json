        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Completing the Square**\n* **Factor out a '1' from the first two terms:** \n   (x^2 + 4x) + 5 \n* **Take half of the coefficient of the x term (which is 4), square it (4), and add and subtract it inside the parentheses:**\n   (x^2 + 4x + 4 - 4) + 5\n* **Rewrite the expression in parentheses as a squared term:**\n   (x + 2)^2 - 4 + 5\n* **Simplify:**\n   (x + 2)^2 + 1\n**2. Identify 'h'**\nNow we have the expression in the form  a(x - h)^2 + k, where:\n* a = 1\n* h = -2 (because it's (x + 2)^2 which is the same as (x - (-2))^2)\n* k = 1\n**Answer:** Therefore,  h = **-2**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Completing the Square**\n* **Factor out a coefficient of 1 from the first two terms:**\n   We have  x\u00b2 + 4x + 5.  Since the coefficient of x\u00b2 is already 1, we don't need to factor anything out.\n* **Take half of the coefficient of the x term, square it, and add and subtract it inside the expression:**\n   Half of 4 is 2, and 2\u00b2 = 4. So we add and subtract 4:\n   x\u00b2 + 4x + 4 + 5 - 4\n* **Rewrite the first three terms as a squared term:**\n   x\u00b2 + 4x + 4 is the same as (x + 2)\u00b2\n   So now we have: (x + 2)\u00b2 + 1\n**2. Identifying h**\n* **The expression is now in the form a(x - h)\u00b2 + k:**\n   We have (x + 2)\u00b2 + 1, which can be rewritten as 1(x - (-2))\u00b2 + 1. \n* **Therefore, h = -2** \n**Final Answer:**  h = -2 \n",
