        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understanding the Domain**\nThe domain of a function is the set of all possible input values (x-values) for which the function produces a valid output.  For rational functions (functions that are fractions with polynomials in the numerator and denominator), the only restriction on the domain comes from the denominator.  We cannot divide by zero.\n**2. Finding the Restriction**\nTherefore, to find the domain restriction, we need to determine when the denominator is equal to zero:\n   x\u00b2 + 4x + c = 0\n**3.  Using the Discriminant**\nThe discriminant of a quadratic equation (ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0) is b\u00b2 - 4ac.  It tells us about the nature of the roots:\n* **Discriminant > 0:** Two distinct real roots (the quadratic crosses the x-axis twice)\n* **Discriminant = 0:** One real root (the quadratic touches the x-axis at one point)\n* **Discriminant < 0:** No real roots (the quadratic does not cross the x-axis)\nWe want the denominator to *never* be zero, meaning the quadratic should have no real roots.  This means the discriminant must be negative.\n**4. Applying the Discriminant**\nIn our case, a = 1, b = 4, and c = c.  Let's set up the inequality for the discriminant:\n   b\u00b2 - 4ac < 0\n   4\u00b2 - 4(1)(c) < 0\n   16 - 4c < 0\n**5. Solving the Inequality**\n   -4c < -16\n   c > 4 \n**6.  Smallest Integer Value**\nThe smallest integer value of c that satisfies c > 4 is **c = 5**.\n**Therefore, the smallest integer value of c such that the function has a domain of all real numbers is 5.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Domain Restriction:**\n* The function will be undefined when the denominator is zero.  \n* To have a domain of all real numbers, the denominator must *never* equal zero.\n**2. Analyze the Denominator:**\n* The denominator is a quadratic expression:  $x^2 + 4x + c$\n**3. Find the Discriminant:**\n* For a quadratic expression of the form $ax^2 + bx + c$, the discriminant is given by $b^2 - 4ac$. \n* The discriminant tells us about the roots of the quadratic:\n    * If the discriminant is positive, the quadratic has two distinct real roots.\n    * If the discriminant is zero, the quadratic has one real root (a double root).\n    * If the discriminant is negative, the quadratic has no real roots.\n**4. Apply the Discriminant to Our Problem:**\n* In our case, the discriminant of the denominator is $4^2 - 4(1)(c) = 16 - 4c$.\n* We want the denominator to have *no* real roots, so the discriminant must be negative: \n    * $16 - 4c < 0$\n**5. Solve the Inequality:**\n* Subtract 16 from both sides: $-4c < -16$\n* Divide both sides by -4 (and remember to flip the inequality sign since we're dividing by a negative number): $c > 4$\n**6. The Smallest Integer Value:**\n* The smallest integer value of *c* that satisfies the inequality $c > 4$ is **c = 5**.\n**Therefore, the smallest integer value of *c* such that the function has a domain of all real numbers is 5.** \n",
