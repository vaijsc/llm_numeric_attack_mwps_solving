        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n1. **Substitute the given values:**\n   We're given that  *x* = 25 and *z* = 24. Substitute these values into the equation:\n   ```\n   1/25 + 1/y = 1/24\n   ```\n2. **Isolate the term with y:**\n   Subtract 1/25 from both sides of the equation:\n   ```\n   1/y = 1/24 - 1/25 \n   ```\n3. **Find a common denominator:**\n   The least common denominator for 24 and 25 is 600.  Rewrite the right side of the equation with this common denominator:\n   ```\n   1/y = (25 - 24)/600 \n   ```\n4. **Simplify:**\n   ```\n   1/y = 1/600\n   ```\n5. **Solve for y:**\n   Since the numerators are both 1, we can see that *y* must equal **600**. \n**Therefore, when x = 25 and z = 24, the value of y is 600.** \n",
