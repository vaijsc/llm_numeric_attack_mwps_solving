    "problem": "If $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7, and $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7, then what is the product of the minimum and the maximum possible degrees of $f(x) + g(x)$?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The minimum possible degree is $0$, since we can find polynomials such that $f(x) = -g(x)+c,$ where $c$ is some nonzero constant. This gives us $f(x) + g(x)=c,$ which has degree $0$. Since we are looking for the product of the minimum and the maximum possible degrees, we can easily see that our answer is $\\boxed{0}.$\n\nNote: The maximum possible degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ is $7,$ since it is impossible for a sum of two polynomials of degree $7$ to include any terms of degree higher than $7.$",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**Understanding Degree**\n* **Degree of a polynomial:** The highest power of the variable in the polynomial. For example, the degree of  `3x^2 + 5x - 1` is 2.\n**Possible Scenarios**\n1. **Maximum Degree:**  The maximum degree of `f(x) + g(x)` occurs when the leading terms of `f(x)` and `g(x)` have the same sign and don't cancel out. In this case, the degree of `f(x) + g(x)` would be 7 (the same as the individual polynomials).\n2. **Minimum Degree:** The minimum degree occurs when the leading terms of `f(x)` and `g(x)` have opposite signs and cancel out.  This would happen if, for example, `f(x) = x^7 + ...` and `g(x) = -x^7 + ...` .  In this scenario, the highest power term would disappear, leaving the next highest power term as the leading term.  This means the degree of `f(x) + g(x)` could be as low as 6.\n**Calculation**\n* **Maximum Degree:** 7\n* **Minimum Degree:** 6\n**Product:** 7 * 6 = **42** \n",
        "Here's how to break down the problem and find the solution:\n**Understanding Degree**\n* The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of the variable in the polynomial. \n* For example, the polynomial  $3x^5 + 2x^2 - 1$ has a degree of 5.\n**Adding Polynomials**\nWhen you add polynomials, you combine terms with the same powers of the variable.  The degree of the resulting polynomial is determined by the highest power of the variable that appears in the sum.\n**Scenario Analysis**\n* **Minimum Degree:**  The minimum degree of  $f(x) + g(x)$ occurs if the leading terms (the terms with the highest powers) of  $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ cancel each other out.  For example, if  $f(x) = x^7 + ...$ and $g(x) = -x^7 + ...$, then the $x^7$ terms would cancel, leaving a polynomial with a degree less than 7. In the worst case, all the terms up to $x^6$ could cancel, leaving a polynomial of degree **0** (a constant).\n* **Maximum Degree:** The maximum degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ occurs if the leading terms of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ have the same sign (both positive or both negative). In this case, the degree of the sum would be **7**.\n**Calculation**\nThe minimum degree is 0, and the maximum degree is 7.  The product of these two degrees is 0 * 7 = **0**. \n",
