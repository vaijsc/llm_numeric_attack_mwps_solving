    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Call the difference between two consecutive terms $x$. The third term is then $2+2x$, and the sixth term is $2+5x$. So, $25 = (2+2x) + (2+5x)$. Solving for $x$ gives $7x = 21$, or $x = 3$. So, the fourth term is $2 + 3\\cdot 3 = \\boxed{11}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand Arithmetic Sequences**\nAn arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers where the difference between any two consecutive terms is constant. This constant difference is called the common difference.\n**2. Set up Equations**\n* Let the common difference of the arithmetic sequence be *d*.\n* The third term is 2 + 2*d.\n* The sixth term is 2 + 5*d.\n* We are given that the sum of the third and sixth terms is 25:  (2 + 2*d) + (2 + 5*d) = 25\n**3. Solve for the Common Difference (d)**\n* Simplify the equation: 4 + 7*d = 25\n* Subtract 4 from both sides: 7*d = 21\n* Divide both sides by 7: d = 3\n**4. Find the Fourth Term**\n* The fourth term is 2 + 3*d = 2 + 3(3) = 11\n**Answer:** The fourth term of the arithmetic sequence is **11**. \n",
