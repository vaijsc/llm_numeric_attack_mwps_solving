    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "This is a geometric sequence with a first term of $2$ and a common ratio of $2$. At the end of the fifteenth day, we are at the 6th term of this sequence, so there are $2\\cdot2^5=\\boxed{64}$ cells then.",

        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n* **Day 3:** The organism starts with 2 cells. After 3 days, each cell splits, so there are 2 * 2 = 4 cells.\n* **Day 6:**  Each of the 4 cells splits, resulting in 4 * 2 = 8 cells.\n* **Day 9:**  Each of the 8 cells splits, resulting in 8 * 2 = 16 cells.\n* **Day 12:** Each of the 16 cells splits, resulting in 16 * 2 = 32 cells.\n* **Day 15:** Each of the 32 cells splits, resulting in 32 * 2 = **64 cells**.\nTherefore, there are **64** cells at the end of the 15th day. \n",
