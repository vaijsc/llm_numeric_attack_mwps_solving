    "solution": "Subtracting the two equations gives: \\begin{align*}\n(729x+731y)-(725x+727y) &= 1508-1500\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 4x+4y &= 8\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x+y &= 2.\n\\end{align*}Multiplying this equation by 725 and subtracting this equation from $725x+727y=1500$ gives \\begin{align*}\n(725x+727y) - 725(x+y) &= 1500-725(x+y) \\implies \\\\\n2y &= 50.\n\\end{align*}So we can write $x-y$ as $(x+y) - 2y$, which equals  $2 - 50 = \\boxed{-48}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Eliminate one variable**\n   * Subtract the first equation from the second equation: \n     (729x + 731y) - (725x + 727y) = 1508 - 1500\n   * This simplifies to: 4x + 4y = 8\n**2. Simplify the equation**\n   * Divide both sides of the equation by 4: \n     x + y = 2\n**3. Isolate one variable**\n   * Solve for x:\n     x = 2 - y\n**4. Substitute to find x - y**\n   * Substitute the expression for x (2 - y) into the expression (x - y):\n     (2 - y) - y  \n   * Simplify:\n     2 - 2y\n**Therefore, the value of x - y is 2 - 2y.** \n**Important Note:** We cannot find a numerical value for x - y without additional information.
