    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We have: $2 < \\sqrt{t} < \\frac{7}{2}$ so squaring the inequality (which we can do because all the terms in it are positive) gives us  $4 < t <\\frac{49}{4}=12.25$.  Therefore, $t$ is an integer between 5 and 12 inclusive, which leaves us with $\\boxed{8}$ possible integer values of $t$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Set up inequalities:**\n* We know that the square root of *t* is greater than 2:  \u221at > 2\n* We know that the square root of *t* is less than 3.5: \u221at < 3.5\n**2. Solve for *t* in each inequality:**\n* Square both sides of the first inequality: (\u221at)\u00b2 > 2\u00b2  => t > 4\n* Square both sides of the second inequality: (\u221at)\u00b2 < 3.5\u00b2 => t < 12.25\n**3. Find the integers within the range:**\nWe know that *t* must be greater than 4 and less than 12.25.  The integers within this range are:\n* 5\n* 6\n* 7\n* 8\n* 9\n* 10\n* 11\n* 12\n**4.

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n* **Understanding the inequality:** The problem states that  2 < \u221at < 3.5. This means the square root of *t* is between 2 and 3.5.\n* **Squaring all parts:** To get rid of the square root, we square all parts of the inequality: \n   2\u00b2 < (\u221at)\u00b2 < 3.5\u00b2 \n   4 < t < 12.25\n* **Finding integer values:** The inequality now tells us that *t* is greater than 4 and less than 12.25.
