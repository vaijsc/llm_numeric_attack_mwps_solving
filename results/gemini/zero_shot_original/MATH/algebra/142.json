    "solution": "First, we simplify the left side, using the exponent rule $x^{-1} = \\frac1x$.  We have  \\[\n\\frac{8^{-1}}{4^{-1}} - a^{-1} = \\frac{1/8}{1/4} - \\frac1a = \\frac18\\cdot \\frac41 -\\frac{1}{a}= \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac1a,\n\\] so we can write the original equation as $\\frac12 - \\frac1a = 1$.  Subtracting $\\frac12$ from both sides gives $-\\frac1a = \\frac12$, and taking the reciprocal of both sides gives $-a = 2$.  Therefore, we have $a = \\boxed{-2}$.",
