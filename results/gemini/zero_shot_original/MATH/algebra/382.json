Thus, $$xy + 3x + 2y + 6 = (x+2)(y+3) = 121.$$Since $x,y$ are positive integers, then $x+2, y+3$ must be a pair of factors of $121$, which are given by $\\{x+2,y+3\\} = \\{1,121\\}, \\{11,11\\}$ or $\\{121,1\\}$. Thus, $\\{x,y\\} = \\{-1,118\\},\\{9,8\\}$ or $\\{119, -2\\}.$  Since $x$ and $y$ are positive integers, $\\{x,y\\} = \\{9,8\\},$ so $x+y = 9 + 8 = \\boxed{17}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Rearrange the equation:**\n* Add 1 to both sides of the equation to complete the square on the left side: \n   3x + 2y + xy + 1 = 116\n*  Factor the left side:\n   (x + 1)(y + 3) = 116\n**2. Find the factors of 116:**\nThe factors of 116 are: 1, 2, 4, 29, 58, and 116.\n**3. Determine the possible values of x and y:**\nSince x and y are positive integers, we need to find pairs of factors of 116 where one factor is one more than x and the other factor is three more than y.  \n* If x + 1 = 29 and y + 3 = 4, then x = 28 and y = 1.\n* If x + 1 = 58 and y + 3 = 2, then x = 57 and y = -1 (not a valid solution since y must be positive).\n* If x + 1 = 116 and y + 3 = 1, then x = 115 and y = -2 (not a valid solution since y must be positive).\n**4. Calculate x + y:**\nThe only valid solution is x = 28 and y = 1.  Therefore, x + y = 28 + 1 = **29**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Rearrange the Equation**\nStart by rearranging the equation to make it easier to work with:\n```\n3x + 2y + xy = 115 \nxy + 3x + 2y = 115\n```\n**2. Complete the Square**\nThe goal is to manipulate the equation so that we can express it as a product of two binomials. To do this, we'll complete the square:\n* **Add 6 to both sides:**  This is because (3/2)^2 = 9/4 and 2*(3/2) = 3, so we add 6 to the left side to create a perfect square trinomial.\n   ```\n   xy + 3x + 2y + 6 = 115 + 6\n   ```\n* **Factor by grouping:** Now, we can factor the left side:\n   ```\n   x(y + 3) + 2(y + 3) = 121\n   (x + 2)(y + 3) = 121\n   ```\n**3. Find the Factors**\nSince we're looking for positive integer solutions, we need to find the factors of 121.  The factors of 121 are 1, 11, and 121.\n**4. Solve for Possible Values**\nNow we have two possible scenarios:\n* **Scenario 1:**  \n   *  x + 2 = 1  and y + 3 = 121\n   *  This leads to x = -1 and y = 118, but these values are not positive integers. \n* **Scenario 2:**\n   *  x + 2 = 11 and y + 3 = 11\n   *  This leads to x = 9 and y = 8. These are positive integers.\n**5. Find x + y**\nThe only valid solution is x = 9 and y = 8. Therefore:\nx + y = 9 + 8 = **17** \n",

To do this, we'll use a technique similar to completing the square:\n* **Add 6 to both sides:**  \n    *  $xy + 3x + 2y + 6 = 121$\n* **Factor the left side:** \n    *  $(x+2)(y+3) = 121$\n**3. Factor 121:**\n* Find the factors of 121:  1 and 121, 11 and 11.\n**4. Solve for Possible Values:**\nSince *x* and *y* are positive integers, we have two possibilities:\n* **Possibility 1:**  x + 2 = 1 and y + 3 = 121, which gives us x = -1 and y = 118 (not a valid solution since *x* must be positive).\n* **Possibility 2:** x + 2 = 11 and y + 3 = 11, which gives us x = 9 and y = 8.\n**5.

        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Manipulate the Equation**\nThe equation  $3x + 2y + xy = 115$ is a bit tricky to work with directly.

Find the Factors of 121**\nSince 121 is a perfect square, its factors are:\n* 1 and 121\n* 11 and 11\n**3.

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Rearrange the equation:**\n* Move the constant term to the left side: \n   3x + 2y + xy - 115 = 0\n**2.

The factors of 115 are 1, 5, 23, and 115.\n**4. Consider the possibilities:**\n* **Case 1:** If (x + 1) = 1 and (3 + y) = 115, then x = 0 and y = 112. This is not valid since x must be positive.\n* **Case 2:** If (x + 1) = 5 and (3 + y) = 23, then x = 4 and y = 20. This is a valid solution.\n* **Case 3:** If (x + 1) = 23 and (3 + y) = 5, then x = 22 and y = 2. This is also a valid solution.\n* **Case 4:** If (x + 1) = 115 and (3 + y) = 1, then x = 114 and y = -2. This is not valid since y must be positive.\n**5. Find x + y:**\n* From the valid solutions, we have:\n    *  x + y = 4 + 20 = 24\n    *  x + y = 22 + 2 = 24\n**Answer:**  Therefore, the value of x + y is **24**. \n"
