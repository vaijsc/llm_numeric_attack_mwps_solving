    "solution": "By the quadratic formula, $x = \\frac{-b + \\sqrt{b^2 - 4c}}{2}, \\frac{-b - \\sqrt{b^2 - 4c}}{2}$. The difference of these is $\\frac{2\\sqrt{b^2 - 4c}}{2} = \\sqrt{b^2 - 4c}$. Setting this equal to $|b - 2c|$, it follows that (after squaring) $b^2 - 4c = (b-2c)^2 = b^2 + 4c^2 - 4bc$. Thus $$0 = 4c^2 + 4c - 4bc = 4c(c - b + 1).$$As $c \\neq 0$, it follows that $c = \\boxed{b - 1}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Relationship between Roots and Coefficients**\nFor a quadratic equation of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, let the roots be $r_1$ and $r_2$. We know the following relationships:\n* **Sum of roots:**  $r_1 + r_2 = -\\frac{b}{a}$\n* **Product of roots:** $r_1 \\cdot r_2 = \\frac{c}{a}$\n**2. Express the Difference of Roots in Terms of the Coefficients**\nWe are given that the difference of the roots is $|b - 2c|$. This can be expressed as:\n* $|r_1 - r_2| = |b - 2c|$\n**3.  Square Both Sides to Eliminate the Absolute Value**\nSquaring both sides eliminates the absolute value:\n* $(r_1 - r_2)^2 = (b - 2c)^2$\n**4. Expand and Simplify**\nExpand the squared terms:\n* $r_1^2 - 2r_1r_2 + r_2^2 = b^2 - 4bc + 4c^2$\n**5. Use the Relationships from Step 1**\nRecall that $r_1 + r_2 = -b$ and $r_1 \\cdot r_2 = c$.  We can rewrite the left side of the equation:\n* $(r_1 + r_2)^2 - 4r_1r_2 = b^2 - 4bc + 4c^2$\n* $(-b)^2 - 4c = b^2 - 4bc + 4c^2$\n* $b^2 - 4c = b^2 - 4bc + 4c^2$\n**6. Solve for c**\nSimplify and solve for *c*:\n* $4bc = 4c^2 + 4c$\n* $bc = c^2 + c$\n* $c^2 + c - bc = 0$\nSince $c \\neq 0$, we can divide both sides by *c*:\n* $c + 1 - b = 0$\n**7.
