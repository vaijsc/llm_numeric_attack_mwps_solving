        "Here's how to find the range of the function step-by-step:\n**1. Understand Absolute Value**\nThe absolute value of a number is its distance from zero.

Analyze the Function in Each Case**\n* **Case 1:**  F(x) = -2x + 4 is a decreasing linear function. As x gets more negative, F(x) gets larger.  \n* **Case 2:** F(x) = 6 is a constant function.  \n* **Case 3:** F(x) = 2x - 4 is an increasing linear function. As x gets larger, F(x) gets larger.\n**4. Determine the Range**\n* The smallest possible value of F(x) occurs when x is very negative (Case 1) and goes to infinity.\n* The largest possible value of F(x) occurs when x is very positive (Case 3) and also goes to infinity.\n* The function also takes on the constant value of 6 in Case 2.\n**5.
