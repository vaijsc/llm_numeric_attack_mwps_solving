        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Calculate 500% of 10:**\n*  500% is equivalent to 5 (since 100% = 1, then 500% = 5).\n*  500% of 10 is 5 * 10 = 50\n**2. Calculate Five plus 500% of 10:**\n*  5 + 50 = 55\n**3. Set up an equation:**\n* Let \"x\" represent the unknown number.\n* 110% of x is the same as 55. \n* We can write this as: 1.10 * x = 55 (since 110% = 1.10)\n**4. Solve for x:**\n* Divide both sides of the equation by 1.10:\n    * x = 55 / 1.10\n    * x = 50\n**Answer:** Five plus 500% of 10 is the same as 110% of **50**. \n",
