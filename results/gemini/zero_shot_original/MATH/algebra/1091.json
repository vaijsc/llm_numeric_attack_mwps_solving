    "solution": "We could subtract $292$ to the other side and try to solve the sixth-degree equation, but that would be ugly and we have no guarantee that it would even work. We notice that we can add a $x^4-x^4 + x^2 - x^2$ to the polynomial without changing its value: $$x^6-2x^5+(x^4-x^4)+2x^3+(x^2-x^2)-2x+1=292.$$ We regroup the terms and factor the left side, leaving the $292$ alone. \\begin{align*}\n(x^6-2x^5+x^4)+(-x^4+2x^3+-x^2)+(x^2-2x+1)&=292\\\\\nx^4(x^2-2x+1)-x^2(x^2-2x+1)+1(x^2-2x+1)&=292\\\\\n(x^2-2x+1)(x^4-x^2+1)&=292\\\\\n(x-1)^2(x^4-x^2+1)&=292.\n\\end{align*} To see a different way of obtaining this factorization, we could also group the $x^6$ and $1$ terms together and factor, giving: \\begin{align*}\n(x^6+1)+(-2x^5+2x^3-2x)&=292\\\\\n(x^2+1)(x^4-x^2+1)-2x(x^4-x^2+1)&=292\\\\\n(x^4-x^2+1)(x^2+1-2x)&=292\\\\\n(x^4-x^2+1)(x-1)^2&=292.\\\\\n\\end{align*} Since $x$ is an integer, then $x^4-x^2+1$ and $x-1$ are integers, so they must be factors of $292$. The prime factorization of $292$ is $2^2\\cdot 73$. The value $(x-1)^2$ must be a square which divides $292$, and we can see that the only squares which divide $292$ are $1$ and $4$.\n\nIf $(x-1)^2=1$, then $x-1=\\pm 1$, and $x=2$ or $x=0$. If $x=0$, it's easy to see from the original equation that it won't work, since the left side of the original equation would be $1$ while the right side would be $292$. If $x=2$, then the left side would equal $(2^4-2^2+1)(2-1)^2=(16-4+1)(1)^2=13\\neq 292$. So both values of $x$ are impossible.\n\nThus $(x-1)^2=4$, so $x-1=\\pm 2$ and $x=3$ or $x=-1$. If $x=-1$, then we have the left side as $((-1)^4-(-1)^2+1)((-1)-1)^2=(1-1+1)(-2)^2=1(4)=4\\neq 292$. If $x=3$, then we have $(3^4-3^2+1)(3-1)^2=(81-9+1)(2^2)=73\\cdot2^2=292$ as desired. Thus the only possibility for $x$ is $\\boxed{3}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Recognize the Pattern**\nNotice that the equation looks like a factored polynomial:\n* The terms have alternating signs.\n* The coefficients seem to follow a pattern (1, -2, 2, -2, 1).\n**2. Factor the Polynomial**\nThe polynomial can be factored by grouping:\n* **Group the first three terms and the last two terms:**\n   (x^6 - 2x^5 + 2x^3) + (-2x + 1)\n* **Factor out common factors:**\n   x^3(x^3 - 2x^2 + 2) - 1(2x - 1)\n* **Notice a common factor:**\n   x^3(x^3 - 2x^2 + 2) - 1(x^3 - 2x^2 + 2)\n* **Factor out (x^3 - 2x^2 + 2):**\n   (x^3 - 2x^2 + 2)(x^3 - 1)\n**3. Factor Further**\n* **Factor the difference of cubes:**\n   (x^3 - 2x^2 + 2)(x - 1)(x^2 + x + 1)\n**4. Solve the Equation**\nNow we have: \n(x^3 - 2x^2 + 2)(x - 1)(x^2 + x + 1) = 292\n* **Consider the factors:**\n    * (x^2 + x + 1) is always positive for any real value of x (its discriminant is negative).\n    * (x^3 - 2x^2 + 2) is a cubic function, and it's difficult to solve directly.  We'll try to find a solution by inspection.\n    * (x - 1) is a simple linear factor.\n* **Test values:**\n    * If we try x = 3, we get:\n        * (3^3 - 2(3^2) + 2)(3 - 1)(3^2 + 3 + 1) = (11)(2)(13) = 286. This is close to 292.\n    * If we try x = 4, we get:\n        * (4^3 - 2(4^2) + 2)(4 - 1)(4^2 + 4 + 1) = (42)(3)(21) = 2646. This is much too large.\n* **Since 292 is close to 286, let's try x = 3 in the original equation:**\n    * 3^6 - 2(3^5) + 2(3^3) - 2(3) + 1 = 729 - 486 + 54 - 6 + 1 = 292 \n**Solution**\nTherefore, the solution to the equation is **x = 3**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Recognize the pattern:**\nThe equation looks a bit complicated, but notice the pattern in the exponents: 6, 5, 3, 1. This suggests that we might be able to factor the expression.\n**2. Factor by Grouping:**\n* **Group the first two terms and the last two terms:**\n   (x\u2076 - 2x\u2075) + (2x\u00b3 - 2x) + 1 = 292\n* **Factor out common factors:**\n   x\u2075(x - 2) + 2x(x\u00b2 - 1) + 1 = 292\n* **Factor the difference of squares (x\u00b2 - 1):**\n   x\u2075(x - 2) + 2x(x + 1)(x - 1) + 1 = 292\n**3.  Simplify and solve for x:**\n* **Rearrange the equation:**\n   x\u2075(x - 2) + 2x(x + 1)(x - 1) = 291\n* **Try substituting values:**  At this point, it's a good idea to try substituting a few small integer values for *x* to see if we get a solution. \n* **Notice that x = 3 works!**  \n   (3\u2075)(3 - 2) + 2(3)(3 + 1)(3 - 1) = 243 + 48 = 291\n**Therefore, x = 3 is the solution to the equation.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Recognize the pattern:**\nThe given equation looks a bit like a factored expression. Notice that the terms have alternating signs and the exponents decrease by two: \n*  x\u2076 - 2x\u2075 + 2x\u00b3 - 2x + 1\n**2. Factor by Grouping:**\nWe can try factoring by grouping:\n* **Group the first two and the last two terms:**  (x\u2076 - 2x\u2075) + (2x\u00b3 - 2x) + 1\n* **Factor out common factors:** x\u2075(x - 2) + 2x(x\u00b2 - 1) + 1\n* **Factor the difference of squares:** x\u2075(x - 2) + 2x(x + 1)(x - 1) + 1\n**3. Simplify the expression:**\nUnfortunately, we can't factor this further directly.  Let's focus on the equation:\nx\u2075(x - 2) + 2x(x + 1)(x - 1) + 1 = 292\n**4.  Trial and Error:**\nSince we're dealing with integers, we can try plugging in some values for *x* to see if we can find a solution:\n* **Try x = 2:**  2\u2075(2 - 2) + 2(2)(2 + 1)(2 - 1) + 1 = 13.  This doesn't work.\n* **Try x = 3:**  3\u2075(3 - 2) + 2(3)(3 + 1)(3 - 1) + 1 = 292. This works!\n**Solution:**\nTherefore, the integer solution to the equation is **x = 3**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Recognize the pattern:**\nNotice that the equation looks like a slightly modified version of a binomial expansion.  The powers of *x* decrease in even steps (6, 4, 2, 0), and the coefficients are reminiscent of the binomial theorem. \n**2. Factor by grouping:**\n* Group the terms as follows:\n   (x\u2076 - 2x\u2075 + x\u2074) + (-x\u2074 + 2x\u00b3 - 2x\u00b2 + x) + (x\u00b2 - 2x + 1) = 292\n* Factor out common factors from each group:\n   x\u2074(x\u00b2 - 2x + 1) - x\u00b2(x\u00b2 - 2x + 1) + (x\u00b2 - 2x + 1) = 292\n* Notice that (x\u00b2 - 2x + 1) appears in each term. Factor it out:\n   (x\u00b2 - 2x + 1)(x\u2074 - x\u00b2 + 1) = 292\n**3. Simplify:**\n* The first factor is a perfect square trinomial: (x - 1)\u00b2 \n* The second factor is a quadratic in terms of x\u00b2. Let's substitute y = x\u00b2:\n   (x - 1)\u00b2 (y\u00b2 - y + 1) = 292\n**4. Find the factors of 292:**\n* The prime factorization of 292 is 2\u00b2 * 73.  \n**5. Test possibilities:**\n* Since (x - 1)\u00b2 is always non-negative,  we need to find factors of 292 where one factor is at least 1.\n* The only possibility is 292 = 1 * 292.\n**6. Solve for x:**\n*  If (x - 1)\u00b2 = 1, then x - 1 = 1 or x - 1 = -1. This gives us x = 2 or x = 0.\n*  If (y\u00b2 - y + 1) = 292, then y\u00b2 - y - 291 = 0. This quadratic does not factor easily, and its roots are not integers.\n**7. Verify the solution:**\n* Let's check if x = 2 or x = 0 satisfies the original equation.\n* For x = 2: 2\u2076 - 2 * 2\u2075 + 2 * 2\u00b3 - 2 * 2 + 1 = 64 - 64 + 16 - 4 + 1 = 19. This is not equal to 292.\n* For x = 0: 0\u2076 - 2 * 0\u2075 + 2 * 0\u00b3 - 2 * 0 + 1 = 1. This is not equal to 292.\n**Conclusion:**\nThere are **no integer solutions** to the equation x\u2076 - 2x\u2075 + 2x\u00b3 - 2x + 1 = 292. \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem:\n**1. Recognize a pattern:**\nNotice that the equation has a symmetrical pattern of coefficients:\n*  The coefficients are: 1, -2, 0, 2, -2, 1\n*  They are symmetrical around the middle term (which is 0 in this case).\nThis suggests we might be able to factor the expression.\n**2. Factoring:**\n* **Group the terms:** \n   (x\u2076 - 2x\u2075 + x\u2074) + (-x\u2074 + 2x\u00b3 - x\u00b2) + (x\u00b2 - 2x + 1) = 292\n* **Factor out common factors:**\n   x\u2074(x\u00b2 - 2x + 1) - x\u00b2(x\u00b2 - 2x + 1) + (x\u00b2 - 2x + 1) = 292\n* **Factor out (x\u00b2 - 2x + 1):**\n   (x\u00b2 - 2x + 1)(x\u2074 - x\u00b2 + 1) = 292\n* **Recognize a perfect square trinomial:**\n   (x - 1)\u00b2 (x\u2074 - x\u00b2 + 1) = 292\n**3. Simplify:**\nWe need to find the values of x that satisfy the equation.  Let's focus on the first factor:\n* (x - 1)\u00b2 = 292 / (x\u2074 - x\u00b2 + 1)\n**4. Analyze the factors:**\n*  (x - 1)\u00b2 is always non-negative since it's a square.\n*  (x\u2074 - x\u00b2 + 1) is also always positive.  We can see this by completing the square:  x\u2074 - x\u00b2 + 1 = (x\u00b2 - 1/2)\u00b2 + 3/4.\n**5. Find possible values of x:**\nSince (x - 1)\u00b2 is non-negative and (x\u2074 - x\u00b2 + 1) is positive, their ratio (292 / (x\u2074 - x\u00b2 + 1)) must also be non-negative.  This means that 292 / (x\u2074 - x\u00b2 + 1) must be a positive integer, and (x - 1)\u00b2 must be a perfect square.\n**6. Trial and Error:**\nLet's try some values of (x - 1)\u00b2 that are perfect squares:\n* **If (x - 1)\u00b2 = 1:**  Then x = 2 or x = 0. We need to check if these values work in the original equation. Neither value works.\n* **If (x - 1)\u00b2 = 4:** Then x = 3 or x = -1. We need to check if these values work in the original equation. Neither value works. \n* **If (x - 1)\u00b2 = 9:** Then x = 4 or x = -2. We need to check if these values work in the original equation. Neither value works.\nWe can continue trying larger perfect squares for (x - 1)\u00b2, but we'll find that none of them will lead to a solution where the original equation is satisfied. \n**Conclusion:**\nThere is **no integer solution** for x that satisfies the equation x\u2076 - 2x\u2075 + 2x\u00b3 - 2x + 1 = 292. \n"
