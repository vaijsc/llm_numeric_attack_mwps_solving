        "Here's how to solve this step-by-step:\n**1. Calculate the quarterly interest rate:**\n* Annual interest rate: 7.5%\n* Quarterly interest rate: 7.5% / 4 = 1.875%\n**2. Calculate the number of quarters in two years:**\n* Years: 2\n* Quarters per year: 4\n* Total quarters: 2 * 4 = 8\n**3. Calculate the future value of the investment using the compound interest formula:**\n* Future value (FV) = Present value (PV) * (1 + r)^n \n    * PV = $1000\n    * r = 0.01875 (quarterly interest rate as a decimal)\n    * n = 8 (number of quarters)\n**4. Substitute the values into the formula and calculate:**\n* FV = $1000 * (1 + 0.01875)^8\n* FV \u2248 $1000 * (1.1611)\n* FV \u2248 $1161.10\n**Therefore, to the nearest dollar, Lauren had approximately $1161 in her account when she turned two.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Determine the number of compounding periods:**\n* Lauren turned two on January 1, 1992. \n* There are 2 years in this period.\n* Since interest is compounded quarterly (4 times a year), there are 2 years * 4 quarters/year = 8 compounding periods.\n**2. Calculate the quarterly interest rate:**\n* The annual interest rate is 7.5%.\n* The quarterly interest rate is 7.5% / 4 = 1.875%.\n**3. Use the compound interest formula:**\nThe compound interest formula is:\nA = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)\nWhere:\n* A = the future value of the investment/loan, including interest\n* P = the principal investment amount (the initial deposit)\n* r = the annual interest rate (as a decimal)\n* n = the number of times that interest is compounded per year\n* t = the number of years the money is invested or borrowed for\n**4. Plug in the values:**\n* A = 1000 (1 + 0.01875)^(8)\n* A = 1000 (1.01875)^8\n**5. Calculate the final amount:**\n* A \u2248 1000 * 1.1621\n* A \u2248 $1162\n**Therefore, there was approximately $1162 in Lauren's account when she turned two.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Determine the number of compounding periods:**\n* Lauren turns two on January 1, 1992, which is 2 years after her birth.\n* There are 4 quarters in a year, so there are 2 years * 4 quarters/year = 8 compounding periods.\n**2. Calculate the quarterly interest rate:**\n* The annual interest rate is 7.5%, so the quarterly interest rate is 7.5% / 4 = 1.875%.\n**3.

Calculate the quarterly interest rate:**\n* Annual interest rate: 7.5%\n* Quarterly interest rate: 7.5% / 4 = 1.875% \n**3. Calculate the amount after each quarter:**\n* We'll use the compound interest formula: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)\n    * A = the future value of the investment/loan, including interest\n    * P = the principal investment amount (the initial deposit)\n    * r = the annual interest rate (as a decimal)\n    * n = the number of times that interest is compounded per year\n    * t = the number of years the money is invested or borrowed for\n* After the first quarter: A = $1000(1 + 0.01875/1)^(1*1) \u2248 $1018.75\n* After the second quarter: A = $1018.75(1 + 0.01875/1)^(1*1) \u2248 $1037.81\n* Continue this process for all 8 quarters.\n**4.  Use a shortcut with a calculator:**\nSince we're dealing with repeated compounding, we can simplify the calculations by raising the growth factor to the power of 8 (the total number of quarters):\n* Final amount: $1000 (1 + 0.01875/1)^(1*8) \u2248 $1160.54\n**Therefore, to the nearest dollar, Lauren would have approximately $1161 in her account when she turned two.** \n",
