    "solution": "The store's revenue is given by: number of books sold $\\times$ price of each book, or\n\\[p(120-3p)=120p-3p^2.\\]We want to maximize this expression by completing the square. We can factor out a $-3$ to get $-3(p^2-40p)$.\n\nTo complete the square, we add $(40/2)^2=400$ inside the parenthesis and subtract $-3\\cdot400=-1200$ outside. We are left with the expression\n\\[-3(p^2-40p+400)+1200=-3(p-20)^2+1200.\\]Note that the $-3(p-20)^2$ term will always be nonpositive since the perfect square is always nonnegative. Thus, the revenue is maximized when $-3(p-20)^2$ equals 0, which is when $p=20$. Thus, the store should charge $\\boxed{20}$ dollars for the book.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Define Revenue**\n* Revenue is the total income from selling the books. \n* It's calculated by multiplying the price per book by the number of books sold.\n**2. Set up the Revenue Equation**\n* Let `R` represent the revenue.\n* We know:\n    * Price per book = `p`\n    * Number of books sold = `120 - 3p`\n* Therefore, the revenue equation is: \n   `R = p(120 - 3p)`\n**3. Simplify the Revenue Equation**\n* Expanding the equation, we get:\n   `R = 120p - 3p\u00b2`\n**4. Find the Maximum Revenue**\n* The revenue equation is a quadratic equation (shaped like a parabola).  The maximum revenue occurs at the vertex of the parabola. \n* The x-coordinate of the vertex of a parabola in the form `ax\u00b2 + bx + c` is given by `-b / 2a`.\n**5. Apply the Formula**\n* In our revenue equation (`R = 120p - 3p\u00b2`):\n    * `a = -3`\n    * `b = 120`\n* The price `p` that maximizes revenue is:\n    * `p = -b / 2a = -120 / (2 * -3) = 20`\n**6. Answer**\nThe bookstore should charge **$20** per book to maximize its revenue. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Define Revenue**\n* Revenue is the total income from sales. \n* Revenue = (Price per book) * (Number of books sold)\n**2. Set Up the Revenue Equation**\n* We know the price per book is *p*.\n* We know the number of books sold is *120 - 3p*.\n* Therefore, the revenue equation is:  **R(p) = p(120 - 3p)**\n**3. Expand the Equation**\n* R(p) = 120p - 3p\u00b2\n**4. Find the Maximum Revenue**\n* The revenue equation is a quadratic function, which means its graph is a parabola.  The maximum revenue occurs at the vertex of the parabola.\n* To find the vertex's x-coordinate (which represents the price *p* in our case), we can use the formula: \n   * p = -b / 2a  \n   * Where 'a' and 'b' are the coefficients of the quadratic equation. In our equation, a = -3 and b = 120.\n**5. Calculate the Price**\n* p = -120 / (2 * -3) = 20\n**6. Answer**\nThe bookstore should charge **$20** per book to maximize its revenue. \n",
