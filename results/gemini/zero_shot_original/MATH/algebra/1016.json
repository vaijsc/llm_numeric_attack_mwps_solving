    "solution": "The odd integers between 46 and 64 are 47, 49, $\\dots$, 63.  These integers form an arithmetic sequence with common difference 2, so the $n^{\\text{th}}$ term in this sequence is $47 + 2(n - 1) = 2n + 45$.\n\nIf $2n + 45 = 63$, then $n = 9$, so there are 9 such odd integers.  The sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, so the sum is $(47 + 63)/2 \\cdot 9 = \\boxed{495}$.",

        "Here's how to find the sum of the odd integers between 46 and 64:\n**1. Identify the odd integers:**\n* The first odd integer greater than 46 is 47.\n* The last odd integer less than 64 is 63.\n**2.  Recognize the pattern:**\n* The odd integers form an arithmetic sequence: 47, 49, 51, ..., 63.\n* The common difference is 2.\n**3.  Apply the arithmetic series formula:**\n* The sum (S) of an arithmetic series is: S = (n/2) * [2a + (n-1)d]\n   *  where:\n      * n = number of terms\n      * a = first term\n      * d = common difference\n**4. Calculate the number of terms (n):**\n*  We can use the formula: a + (n-1)d = l  (where l is the last term)\n*  Substitute the values: 47 + (n-1)2 = 63\n*  Simplify: 47 + 2n - 2 = 63\n*  Solve for n: 2n = 18  =>  n = 9\n**5. Apply the sum formula:**\n* S = (9/2) * [2(47) + (9-1)2]\n* S = (9/2) * [94 + 16]\n* S = (9/2) * 110\n* S = 495\n**Therefore, the sum of the odd integers between 46 and 64 is 495.** \n",
