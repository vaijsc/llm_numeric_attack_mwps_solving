        "Here's how to solve this step by step:\n**1. Understand the notation:**\n*  *f(g(x))* means we're composing the functions. We'll first evaluate the inner function *g(x)*, and then use that result as the input for the outer function *f(x)*.\n**2. Evaluate g(x):**\n* We're given *g(x) = -3*.  This means no matter what the input *x* is, the output of *g(x)* will always be -3.\n**3. Substitute the result into f(x):**\n* Now we know *g(x) = -3*.  So, we need to find *f(-3)*.\n* Substitute -3 into the function *f(x) = 2x + 1*:\n   * f(-3) = 2(-3) + 1 \n   * f(-3) = -6 + 1\n   * f(-3) = -5\n**Therefore, the value of f(g(x)) is -5.** \n",
