        "Here's how to solve the problem step by step:\n**1. Understand the problem:**\n* We're given the value of pi (approximately 3.1415926...) and asked to find the sum of two absolute values.\n* Absolute values represent the distance from zero. So, |x| means the positive value of x, regardless of whether x is positive or negative.\n**2. Calculate the values inside the absolute values:**\n* **|\u03c0 - 3.14|:**  Since \u03c0 is slightly larger than 3.14, this value is the positive difference between them.\n* **|\u03c0 - 22/7|:**  The fraction 22/7 is a common approximation for pi. To determine whether \u03c0 is larger or smaller than 22/7, we need to compare them. Since 22/7 is approximately 3.142857, it's slightly larger than pi.  Therefore, this value is the positive difference between 22/7 and \u03c0.\n**3.  Find the exact values:**\n* **|\u03c0 - 3.14| = \u03c0 - 3.14** (Since \u03c0 is greater than 3.14)\n* **|\u03c0 - 22/7| = 22/7 - \u03c0** (Since 22/7 is greater than \u03c0)\n**4.  Add the two values:**\n*  (\u03c0 - 3.14) + (22/7 - \u03c0) = 22/7 - 3.14\n**5.  Simplify the answer:**\n* 22/7 - 3.14 = 22/7 - 21.98 = 0.02 = **1/50**\n**Therefore, the exact value of |\u03c0 - 3.14| + |\u03c0 - 22/7| is 1/50.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the problem:**\n* We're asked to find the absolute value of the difference between pi and 3.14, added to the absolute value of the difference between pi and 22/7.\n* The absolute value of a number is its distance from zero, always a positive value. \n**2. Calculate the differences:**\n* **|\u03c0 - 3.14|:**  Since pi is slightly larger than 3.14, this difference is positive:  \u03c0 - 3.14 \n* **|\u03c0 - 22/7|:** Since 22/7 is a slightly better approximation of pi than 3.14, this difference is negative:  - (\u03c0 - 22/7)\n**3. Simplify the expression:**\n* Our expression now is: (\u03c0 - 3.14) + (- (\u03c0 - 22/7))\n* The pi terms cancel out:  - 3.14 + 22/7\n**4. Convert decimals to fractions:**\n* 3.14 = 314/100 = 157/50 \n**5. Find a common denominator and add:**\n*  -157/50 + 22/7 = (-157 * 7 + 22 * 50) / (50 * 7) = (11 - 1099)/350 \n**6. Simplify the result:**\n*  The exact value is **-1088/350**, which simplifies to **-544/175**. \n**Therefore, the exact value of |\u03c0 - 3.14| + |\u03c0 - 22/7| is -544/175.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the problem:**\n* We know that pi (\u03c0) is an irrational number, meaning its decimal representation goes on forever without repeating.\n* We're given two approximations of pi: 3.14 and 22/7.\n* The problem asks us to find the sum of the absolute differences between pi and each of these approximations.\n**2. Calculate the differences:**\n* **|\u03c0 - 3.14|:**  Since 3.14 is less than pi, this difference is simply \u03c0 - 3.14.\n* **|\u03c0 - 22/7|:**  Since 22/7 is greater than pi, this difference is 22/7 - \u03c0.\n**3. Add the differences:**\n* (\u03c0 - 3.14) + (22/7 - \u03c0) \n**4. Simplify:**\n* The \u03c0 terms cancel out, leaving us with: 22/7 - 3.14\n**5. Convert to a common fraction:**\n* 22/7 is already a fraction. \n* 3.14 is equivalent to 314/100.\n* To subtract fractions, we need a common denominator.  The least common denominator of 7 and 100 is 700.\n* (22/7) * (100/100) = 2200/700\n* (314/100) * (7/7) = 2198/700\n**6. Final Calculation:**\n* 2200/700 - 2198/700 = **2/700 = 1/350**\n**Therefore, the exact value of |\u03c0 - 3.14| + |\u03c0 - 22/7| is 1/350.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand Absolute Value**\nThe absolute value of a number is its distance from zero.  It's always positive.

Simplify the Expression**\nNow we have:\n   (\u03c0 - 3.14) + (22/7 - \u03c0)\nNotice that the \u03c0 terms cancel out, leaving us with:\n   22/7 - 3.14\n**6. Express as a Common Fraction**\n* Convert 3.14 to a fraction:  3.14 = 314/100\n* Find a common denominator for 22/7 and 314/100:  \n    *  22/7 = (22 * 100) / (7 * 100) = 2200/700\n    *  314/100 = (314 * 7) / (100 * 7) = 2200/700\n**7. Calculate the Final Answer**\n  2200/700 - 314/700 = (2200 - 314)/700 = 1886/700\n**Therefore, the exact value of |\u03c0 - 3.14| + |\u03c0 - 22/7| is 1886/700.**  You can simplify this fraction further if needed. \n",
