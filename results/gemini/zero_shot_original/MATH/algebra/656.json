        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Relationship**\nThe equation tells us that when we multiply the polynomial  `(x^2 - 1)` by the polynomial `f(x)`, we get the polynomial `5x^6 - x^5 + 3x^4 + x^3 - 25x^2 + 38x - 17`.\n**2. Factor (x^2 - 1)**\nNotice that `(x^2 - 1)` is a difference of squares, which factors as: \n`(x^2 - 1) = (x + 1)(x - 1)`\n**3. Consider the Degree of the Result**\n* The degree of `(x + 1)(x - 1)` is 2 (since it's a product of two linear factors).\n* The degree of the resulting polynomial `5x^6 - x^5 + 3x^4 + x^3 - 25x^2 + 38x - 17` is 6.\n**4.  Find the Degree of f(x)**\nTo get a degree 6 polynomial when multiplying by a degree 2 polynomial, `f(x)` must have a degree of 4.  \n**Here's why:**\n* When multiplying polynomials, the degree of the product is the sum of the degrees of the factors.\n* If `f(x)` had a degree less than 4, the resulting polynomial would have a degree less than 6.\n* If `f(x)` had a degree greater than 4, the resulting polynomial would have a degree greater than 6.\n**Therefore, the degree of f(x) is 4.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Analyze the given equation:**\nWe are given the equation: \n(x\u00b2 - 1) * f(x) = 5x\u2076 - x\u2075 + 3x\u2074 + x\u00b3 - 25x\u00b2 + 38x - 17\n**2. Factor the left side:**\nNotice that (x\u00b2 - 1) can be factored as (x + 1)(x - 1). So the equation becomes:\n(x + 1)(x - 1) * f(x) = 5x\u2076 - x\u2075 + 3x\u2074 + x\u00b3 - 25x\u00b2 + 38x - 17\n**3. Consider the degree of the polynomial on the right side:**\nThe polynomial on the right side has a degree of 6 (the highest power of x is 6).\n**4. Understand the relationship between the degrees:**\nThe degree of the product of two polynomials is the sum of the degrees of the individual polynomials. In this case, the degree of (x + 1)(x - 1) is 2, and the degree of f(x) is unknown (let's call it 'n').  Therefore:\n* Degree of [(x + 1)(x - 1)] + Degree of [f(x)] = Degree of [5x\u2076 - x\u2075 + 3x\u2074 + x\u00b3 - 25x\u00b2 + 38x - 17]\n* 2 + n = 6\n**5. Solve for the degree of f(x):**\nSubtracting 2 from both sides of the equation, we get:\n* n = 4\n**Therefore, the degree of the polynomial f(x) is 4.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understanding the Equation**\nThe equation tells us that when we multiply the polynomial  *f(x)* by  (x\u00b2 - 1), we get the polynomial on the right-hand side. \n**2. Factoring the Right-Hand Side**\nThe right-hand side polynomial is quite large.  To make things easier, let's try factoring it. We can factor out a (x-1) from the right-hand side:\n```\n5x^6 - x^5 + 3x^4 + x^3 - 25x^2 + 38x - 17 \n= (x-1)(5x^5 + 4x^4 + 7x^3 + 8x^2 - 17x + 17)\n```\n**3. Recognizing the Pattern**\nNotice that we now have:\n(x\u00b2 - 1) * f(x) = (x - 1) * (5x^5 + 4x^4 + 7x^3 + 8x^2 - 17x + 17)\nSince (x\u00b2 - 1) factors as (x - 1)(x + 1), we can cancel out (x - 1) on both sides:\n(x + 1) * f(x) = 5x^5 + 4x^4 + 7x^3 + 8x^2 - 17x + 17\n**4. Finding the Degree of f(x)**\nNow, we have a polynomial on the left-hand side that's one degree less than the polynomial on the right-hand side.  To get a fifth-degree polynomial on the right-hand side, *f(x)* must be a **fourth-degree polynomial**.\n**Therefore, the degree of f(x) is 4.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Analyze the Equation**\nWe have the equation: \n  (x\u00b2 - 1) * f(x) = 5x\u2076 - x\u2075 + 3x\u2074 + x\u00b3 - 25x\u00b2 + 38x - 17\n**2. Factor the Left Side**\nNotice that (x\u00b2 - 1) can be factored as a difference of squares:\n  (x\u00b2 - 1) = (x + 1)(x - 1)\nSo, our equation becomes:\n  (x + 1)(x - 1) * f(x) = 5x\u2076 - x\u2075 + 3x\u2074 + x\u00b3 - 25x\u00b2 + 38x - 17\n**3.  Focus on the Degree**\n* The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of the variable.\n*  The degree of (x + 1) is 1.\n* The degree of (x - 1) is 1.\n* The degree of the right-hand side polynomial is 6.\n**4.  Deduce the Degree of f(x)**\n*  To get a polynomial of degree 6 on the right side, the degree of f(x) must be 4 (since 1 + 1 + 4 = 6). \n**5.  Answer**\nTherefore, the degree of the polynomial *f(x)* is **4**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Problem:**\nWe're given an equation involving a polynomial  *f(x)* and a known factor  *(x\u00b2 - 1)*. We need to find the degree of  *f(x)*. \n**2. Factor the Right Side:**\nNotice that the right side of the equation is a polynomial. Let's factor it:\n*  We can factor out a 5 from all terms:  5(x\u2076 - (1/5)x\u2075 + (3/5)x\u2074 + (1/5)x\u00b3 - 5x\u00b2 + (38/5)x - (17/5))\n*  We can try to factor the expression inside the parentheses. It's a bit tricky, but we can use the Rational Root Theorem to test for potential rational roots.  \n*  After some testing, we find that (x - 1) is a factor of the expression. We can perform polynomial division or synthetic division to get the remaining factor:\n   (x\u2076 - (1/5)x\u2075 + (3/5)x\u2074 + (1/5)x\u00b3 - 5x\u00b2 + (38/5)x - (17/5)) \u00f7 (x - 1) = x\u2075 + (4/5)x\u2074 + (7/5)x\u00b3 + (12/5)x\u00b2 - 3x + (17/5)\n* Now, our right side is factored: 5(x - 1)(x\u2075 + (4/5)x\u2074 + (7/5)x\u00b3 + (12/5)x\u00b2 - 3x + (17/5))\n**3. Analyze the Equation:**\nThe equation now looks like this: \n(x\u00b2 - 1) * f(x) = 5(x - 1)(x\u2075 + (4/5)x\u2074 + (7/5)x\u00b3 + (12/5)x\u00b2 - 3x + (17/5))\nSince (x\u00b2 - 1) is a factor on the left side and (x - 1) is a factor on the right side, they must both be factors of  *f(x)*.\n**4.  Determine the Degree of *f(x)*:**\n* We know *f(x)* has at least (x - 1) and (x\u00b2 - 1) as factors.\n* To make the degree of the left side match the degree of the right side (which is 6),  *f(x)* must have a degree of **3**. \n**Why?**\n* The degree of (x\u00b2 - 1) is 2.\n* The degree of (x - 1) is 1.\n* To get a degree of 6 on the left side, the degree of *f(x)* needs to be 6 - 2 - 1 = 3.\n**Therefore, the degree of *f(x)* is 3.** \n"
