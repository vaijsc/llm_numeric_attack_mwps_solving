    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Painting three times as many houses in the same amount of time requires three times as many workers.  If the job is to be done in half the time, then the number of workers required is multiplied by an additional factor of 2.  Therefore, 6 times as many workers are needed to paint 12 houses in 3 days as it takes to paint 4 houses in 6 days.  Since the latter task takes 5 workers, the former task takes $\\boxed{30}$ workers.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Calculate the work done by one worker in one day:**\n* Five workers paint four houses in six days, meaning they complete 4/6 = 2/3 of a house per day.\n*  Therefore, one worker completes (2/3) / 5 = 2/15 of a house per day.\n**2. Calculate the total work needed:**\n* Painting 12 houses represents 12 units of work.\n**3. Calculate the work needed per day:**\n* To paint 12 houses in three days, you need to complete 12/3 = 4 units of work per day.\n**4. Calculate the number of workers needed:**\n* Since one worker completes 2/15 of a house per day, you need (4) / (2/15) = 30 workers to complete 4 units of work per day.\n**Therefore, you need 30 workers to paint 12 houses in three days.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Calculate the work rate of one worker:**\n* If 5 workers paint 4 houses in 6 days, they paint a total of 4 * 6 = 24 \"house-days\" of work.\n* One worker paints 24 house-days / 5 workers = 4.8 house-days of work.\n**2. Calculate the total work needed:**\n* Painting 12 houses in 3 days requires 12 * 3 = 36 \"house-days\" of work.\n**3. Determine the number of workers needed:**\n* To complete 36 house-days of work, you would need 36 house-days / 4.8 house-days/worker = **7.5 workers**.\n**Since you can't have half a worker, you would need to round up to 8 workers to complete the task in 3 days.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the work rate of one worker:**\n* **Houses per day:** 4 houses / 6 days = 2/3 house per day \n* **Work rate per worker:** (2/3 house per day) / 5 workers = 2/15 of a house per worker per day\n**2. Calculate the total work needed:**\n* **Total houses:** 12 houses\n**3. Determine the required work per day:**\n* **Houses per day:** 12 houses / 3 days = 4 houses per day\n**4. Find the number of workers needed:**\n* **Workers needed:** (4 houses per day) / (2/15 of a house per worker per day) = 30 workers\n**Therefore, you would need 30 workers to paint 12 houses in three days.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Calculate the work rate of one worker:**\n* If 5 workers paint 4 houses in 6 days, they paint a total of 4 houses * 5 workers = 20 worker-days of work.\n* This means one worker can paint 20 worker-days / 6 days = 3.33 houses in six days.\n**2. Calculate the total work needed:**\n* To paint 12 houses in 3 days, you need a total of 12 houses * 3 days = 36 worker-days of work.\n**3. Determine the number of workers needed:**\n* Divide the total work needed by the work rate of one worker: 36 worker-days / 3.33 worker-days/worker = **10.8 workers**.\n**Since you can't have a fraction of a worker, you would need 11 workers to paint 12 houses in three days.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Calculate the work rate of one worker:**\n* Five workers paint four houses in six days, meaning they complete 4/6 = 2/3 of a house per day.\n* Since there are five workers, each worker paints (2/3) / 5 = 2/15 of a house per day.\n**2. Determine the total work needed:**\n* Painting 12 houses represents a total of 12 houses * 1 house/house = 12 units of work.\n**3. Calculate the work rate required:**\n* To paint 12 houses in three days, the workers need to complete 12 units of work / 3 days = 4 units of work per day.\n**4. Find the number of workers needed:**\n* Each worker can complete 2/15 of a house per day, and we need a work rate of 4 units of work per day. \n* Therefore, we need (4 units of work/day) / (2/15 units of work/day/worker) = 30 workers.\n**Answer:** You would need **30 workers** to paint 12 houses in three days. \n"
