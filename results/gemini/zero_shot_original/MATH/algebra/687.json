    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "For the numerator to be defined, the expression inside the square root must be non-negative. Therefore, we have  $$x-2\\ge0.$$ Therefore, $x\\ge2$. The expression is undefined when the denominator is equal to 0, so it is undefined when $$x^2+x-6=(x-2)(x+3)=0.$$ So for the expression to be defined, $x\\neq 2$, $x\\neq -3$, and $x \\ge2$. Therefore, the smallest integer value of $x$ for the expression to be defined is $\\boxed{3}$.",
