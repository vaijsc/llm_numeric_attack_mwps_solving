    "solution": "Let $l$ be the length and $w$ be the width of the rectangular prism. Then, the surface area of the prism is given by $$2lw + 2l \\cdot 3 + 2w \\cdot 3 = 2lw + 6l + 6w = 52.$$Dividing through by $2$, we obtain $lw + 3l + 3w = 26$, and using Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick, it follows that $$lw + 3l + 3w + 9 = (l+3)(w+3) = 35.$$The pairs of (positive) factors of $35$ are given by $\\{1,35\\},\\{5,7\\}$. Only the latter will work, which will give $\\{l,w\\} = \\{2,4\\}$. It follows that the volume of the prism is given by $2 \\times 4 \\times 3 = \\boxed{24}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n* We have a rectangular prism (a box) with a height of 3.\n* We know the surface area is 52.\n* We need to find the volume.\n**2. Set up the Equations**\n* Let the length of the prism be  'l' and the width be 'w'.\n* The surface area of a rectangular prism is given by:  \n   2(lw + lh + wh)\n* We know the height (h) is 3. So, the surface area equation becomes:\n   2(lw + 3l + 3w) = 52\n**3. Simplify the Equation**\n* Divide both sides of the equation by 2:\n   lw + 3l + 3w = 26\n**4. Factor the Equation**\n* Notice that we can factor by grouping:\n   l(w + 3) + 3(w + 3) = 26\n   (l + 3)(w + 3) = 26\n**5. Find Possible Values for Length and Width**\n* Now we need to find the factors of 26 that are 3 more than integers.  The only pair that works is:\n    * (l + 3) = 13 \n    * (w + 3) = 2\n* Solving for l and w:\n    * l = 10\n    * w = -1\n* Since the width cannot be negative, we discard this solution.  Let's try another pair of factors for 26:\n    * (l + 3) = 2\n    * (w + 3) = 13\n* Solving for l and w:\n    * l = -1 \n    * w = 10\n* Again, we discard this solution because the length cannot be negative.\n**6.  Find the Volume**\n* Since we haven't found valid integer side lengths, there is no rectangular prism that meets the given conditions.  Therefore, there is **no volume** possible. \n",

Understand the Problem**\n* We have a rectangular prism (like a box) with a height of 3.\n* We know the surface area is 52.\n* We need to find the volume.\n**2. Set Up Equations**\n* Let the length of the prism be 'l' and the width be 'w'.\n* **Surface Area:** The surface area of a rectangular prism is the sum of the areas of all its faces. We have: \n    * Top and bottom faces: 2 * (l * w)\n    * Front and back faces: 2 * (l * 3) = 6l\n    * Left and right faces: 2 * (w * 3) = 6w\n    * Total Surface Area: 2lw + 6l + 6w = 52\n**3. Simplify the Equation**\n* Divide the surface area equation by 2: lw + 3l + 3w = 26\n**4. Factor**\n* We can factor the equation: (l + 3)(w + 3) - 9 = 26\n* Simplify: (l + 3)(w + 3) = 35\n**5. Find Possible Factors**\n* The factors of 35 are 1 and 35, 5 and 7.  We need to find combinations of these factors that satisfy the condition that (l + 3) and (w + 3) are both integers.\n**6. Solve for Length and Width**\n* The only combination that works is (l + 3) = 7 and (w + 3) = 5.\n* This gives us l = 4 and w = 2.\n**7. Calculate the Volume**\n* Volume of a rectangular prism is length * width * height.\n* Volume = 4 * 2 * 3 = 24\n**Answer:** The volume of the prism is **24**. \n",

Set up the equation:**\n* Let the length of the prism be  *l* and the width be *w*.\n* The surface area of a rectangular prism is given by: 2(lw + lh + wh)\n* We know the height (h) is 3, and the surface area is 52. So we have the equation: 2(lw + 3l + 3w) = 52\n**2. Simplify the equation:**\n* Divide both sides by 2: lw + 3l + 3w = 26\n**3.  Solve for one variable:**\n* Rearrange the equation to isolate *l*:\n   lw + 3l = 26 - 3w\n   l(w + 3) = 26 - 3w\n   l = (26 - 3w) / (w + 3)\n**4. Consider integer solutions:**\n* We need to find integer values for *l* and *w* that satisfy the equation.  \n* Start by trying different integer values for *w* and see if the resulting *l* is also an integer.\n**5. Find the solution:**\n* If we try *w* = 2, we get:\n   l = (26 - 3 * 2) / (2 + 3) = 20 / 5 = 4\n* This gives us a length *l* = 4 and a width *w* = 2, which are both integers.\n**6. Calculate the volume:**\n* The volume of a rectangular prism is given by: lwh\n* Volume = 4 * 2 * 3 = 24\n**Answer:** The volume of the prism is **24**. \n",
