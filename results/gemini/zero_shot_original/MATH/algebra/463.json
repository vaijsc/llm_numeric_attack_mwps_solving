        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Substitute the known root:**\nSince one root of the equation is 2, we can substitute  *x* = 2 into the equation:\n5(2)^2 + 4(2) = *k*\n**2. Solve for *k*:**\nSimplify the equation:\n5(4) + 8 = *k*\n20 + 8 = *k*\n*k* = 28\n**3. The equation now becomes:**\n5*x*\u00b2 + 4*x* = 28\n**4. Find the other root:**\nWe can use the fact that the sum of the roots of a quadratic equation of the form *ax*\u00b2 + *bx* + *c* = 0 is -*b*/a. \nIn our equation, *a* = 5, *b* = 4, and we know one root is 2.  Let the other root be *r*.  Therefore:\n2 + *r* = -4/5\n*r* = -4/5 - 2 \n*r* = -14/5\n**Therefore, the other root of the equation is -14/5.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n1. **Substitute:** Since 2 is a root of the equation, we know that plugging in  *x* = 2 into the equation will make it true. Let's do that: \n   \n   5(2)^2 + 4(2) = *k*\n2. **Simplify:** Calculate the left side of the equation:\n   20 + 8 = *k*\n   \n   28 = *k*\n3. **Find the equation:** Now we know the equation is 5*x*\u00b2 + 4*x* = 28.\n4. **Solve for the other root:**  We can find the other root a couple of ways:\n   * **Factoring:** Rearrange the equation to get 5*x*\u00b2 + 4*x* - 28 = 0. Factor the quadratic to get (5*x* - 14)(*x* + 2) = 0. This gives us solutions *x* = 14/5 and *x* = -2. \n   * **Sum and Product of Roots:** The sum of the roots of a quadratic *ax*\u00b2 + *bx* + *c* = 0 is -*b*/a, and the product of the roots is *c*/a. In our case, the sum of the roots is -4/5, and since one root is 2, the other root must be -4/5 - 2 = -14/5.\n**Therefore, the other root of the equation is -14/5.** \n",
