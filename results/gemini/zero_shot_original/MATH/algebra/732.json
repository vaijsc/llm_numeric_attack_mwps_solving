    "solution": "When $x<-2$ or $x>3$, we have $x^2+bx+c>0$. That means that $x^2+bx+c=0$ at $x=-2$ and $x=3$. So, the parabola has roots at -2 and 3, giving us $(x+2)(x-3)=0$. We can now write $x^2+bx+c=(x+2)(x-3)=x^2-x-6$. Thus, $b=-1$, $c=-6$, and $b+c=-1+(-6)=\\boxed{-7}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Inequality**\nThe inequality  $x^2 + bx + c > 0$  means we're looking for the values of *x* that make the quadratic expression positive. The fact that this is true only when *x* is in the intervals  $(-\\infty, -2) \\cup (3, \\infty)$  tells us that the parabola representing this quadratic opens upwards and has its vertex below the x-axis.\n**2. Factor the Quadratic**\nSince the solution set is given in terms of intervals, we can infer that the quadratic factors into the form:\n  (x + 2)(x - 3) > 0\n**3. Determine the Values of b and c**\nExpanding the factored form:\n  x\u00b2 - x - 6 > 0\nNow, we can see:\n* **b = -1**\n* **c = -6**\n**4. Calculate b + c**\nFinally:\n  b + c = -1 + (-6) = **-7** \n**Therefore, the value of b + c is -7.** \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem:\n**Understanding the Inequality**\nThe inequality  $x^2 + bx + c > 0$ tells us that the quadratic expression represents a parabola that is positive (above the x-axis) only for values of *x* in the intervals  $(-\\infty, -2)$ and $(3, \\infty)$.\n**Key Observations**\n1. **Roots:** The parabola must cross the x-axis at *x* = -2 and *x* = 3 since these are the points where the inequality changes from true to false.  This means -2 and 3 are the roots of the quadratic.\n2. **Shape:** Since the parabola is positive outside of the interval (-2, 3), it must open upwards.\n**Using the Information**\n* **Sum and Product of Roots:**  For a quadratic  $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the sum of the roots is  -b/a and the product of the roots is c/a. Since our leading coefficient is 1 (from the original inequality), we have:\n    * Sum of roots:  (-2) + 3 = -b/1  =>  b = -1\n    * Product of roots: (-2) * 3 = c/1 => c = -6\n**Solution**\nFinally, we can find b + c:\nb + c = -1 + (-6) = **-7** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Inequality**\nThe inequality  $x^2 + bx + c > 0$ tells us that the quadratic expression is positive for the given interval.
