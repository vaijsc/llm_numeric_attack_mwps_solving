        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n* **Find out how many quarts one teaspoon of salt represents:** Since 1/4 teaspoon of salt is needed for 1 quart of water, then 1 teaspoon of salt is needed for 1 / (1/4) = 4 quarts of water.\n* **Calculate the quarts for two teaspoons:**  If 1 teaspoon of salt is used for 4 quarts of water, then 2 teaspoons of salt will be used for 2 * 4 = **8 quarts** of water. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n* **Find out how many quarts one teaspoon of salt is used for:**  Since 1/4 teaspoon of salt is used for 1 quart of water, one teaspoon of salt is used for 1 quart * 4 = 4 quarts of water.\n* **Calculate the quarts needed for two teaspoons:**  If one teaspoon is used for 4 quarts, then two teaspoons are used for 4 quarts * 2 = 8 quarts of water.\n**Answer:** 8 quarts of water will be used for two teaspoons of salt. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n* **Understand the relationship:** The recipe uses 1/4 teaspoon of salt for every 1 quart of water. \n* **Find the water for one teaspoon:**  Since 1/4 teaspoon of salt is used for 1 quart,  one teaspoon of salt would be used for 4 quarts of water (because 1 / (1/4) = 4).\n* **Calculate for two teaspoons:** If one teaspoon of salt uses 4 quarts of water, then two teaspoons of salt would use 8 quarts of water (because 4 x 2 = 8).\n**Answer:** You will need **8 quarts** of water for two teaspoons of salt. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n* **Understand the relationship:**  For every 1/4 teaspoon of salt, we need 1 quart of water.\n* **Find the number of \"1/4 teaspoon\" units:**  Two teaspoons of salt is the same as  2 / (1/4) = 8  units of 1/4 teaspoon.\n* **Calculate the water:**  Since we need 1 quart for each 1/4 teaspoon unit, we need 8 quarts of water.\n**Answer:**  You will need **8 quarts** of water. \n",
