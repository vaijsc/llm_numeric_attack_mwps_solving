        "Here's how to solve for the value of 'y' in the arithmetic sequence:\n**Understanding Arithmetic Sequences**\nAn arithmetic sequence is a list of numbers where the difference between any two consecutive terms is constant. This constant difference is called the common difference.\n**Applying the Concept**\n1. **Identify the common difference:** \n   - The second term (12) is 6 more than the first term (y + 6).\n   - The third term (y) is 12 less than the second term (12).\n   - Therefore, the common difference is -6 (we subtract 6 to get to the next term).\n2. **Set up an equation:**\n   - Since it's an arithmetic sequence, the difference between the second term (12) and the third term (y) must also be -6.\n   - This gives us the equation:  12 - y = -6\n3. **Solve for y:**\n   - Add 'y' to both sides: 12 = -6 + y\n   - Add 6 to both sides: 18 = y\n**Answer:**\nThe value of y in the arithmetic sequence is **18**. \n",
