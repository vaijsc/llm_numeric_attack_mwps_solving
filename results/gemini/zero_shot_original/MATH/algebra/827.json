        "Here's how to evaluate the expression:\n* **Understanding the ceiling function:** The ceiling function, denoted by $\\lceil x \\rceil$, gives the smallest integer greater than or equal to x.\n* **Evaluating  $\\lceil 8.8 \\rceil$:** The smallest integer greater than or equal to 8.8 is 9. So, $\\lceil 8.8 \\rceil = 9$.\n* **Evaluating  $\\lceil -8.8 \\rceil$:** The smallest integer greater than or equal to -8.8 is -8. So, $\\lceil -8.8 \\rceil = -8$.\n* **Adding the results:**  $\\lceil 8.8 \\rceil + \\lceil -8.8 \\rceil = 9 + (-8) = \\boxed{1}$. \n",

        "Here's how to evaluate the expression step-by-step:\n* **Understanding the ceiling function:** The ceiling function, denoted by  \u2308x\u2309,  rounds a number *up* to the nearest integer. \n* **Evaluating \u23088.8\u2309:**  Since 8.8 is already between 8 and 9, the ceiling function rounds it up to 9. So, \u23088.8\u2309 = 9.\n* **Evaluating \u2308-8.8\u2309:** Since -8.8 is between -9 and -8, the ceiling function rounds it up to -8. So, \u2308-8.8\u2309 = -8.\n* **Adding the results:** 9 + (-8) = 1\n**Therefore, \u23088.8\u2309 + \u2308-8.8\u2309 = 1.** \n",
