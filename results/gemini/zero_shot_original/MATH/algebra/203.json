        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Formula for the Sum of an Infinite Geometric Series**\nThe sum (S) of an infinite geometric series is given by:\nS = a / (1 - r)\nwhere:\n* a is the first term\n* r is the common ratio\n**2.  Apply the Given Information**\nWe are given:\n* r = -1/2\n* S = 45\n**3. Substitute and Solve for the First Term (a)**\nSubstitute the given values into the formula:\n45 = a / (1 - (-1/2))\n45 = a / (3/2)\nTo isolate 'a', multiply both sides by (3/2):\n45 * (3/2) = a\n**4.
