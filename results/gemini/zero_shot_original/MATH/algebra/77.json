        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Set the expressions equal to each other:**\n   Since we want to find the value of *x* where the two expressions are equal, we set them equal to each other:\n   ```\n   (2x - 1) / (2x + 2) = (x - 3) / (x - 1) \n   ```\n**2. Cross-multiply:**\n   To get rid of the fractions, we cross-multiply:\n   ```\n   (2x - 1)(x - 1) = (x - 3)(2x + 2) \n   ```\n**3.

If x = -7, this denominator becomes 2(-7) + 2 = -12, which is not zero. \n* The denominator of the second fraction is x - 1.  If x = -7, this denominator becomes -7 - 1 = -8, which is not zero.\n**Conclusion:**\nSince the solution x = -7 does not make any of the denominators zero, it is a valid solution.
