    "problem": "Two consecutive positive even numbers are each squared.  The  difference of the squares is 60.  What is the sum of the original  two numbers?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let the two numbers be $x$ and $x + 2$, where $x$ is even. We want to find $x + (x + 2) = 2x + 2$, and we are told that $(x + 2)^2 - x^2 = 60$. This last equation can be factored as a difference of squares: $(x + 2 + x)(x + 2 - x) = (2x + 2)(2) = 60$. It follows that $2x + 2 = 60/2 = \\boxed{30}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Define Variables:**\n* Let 'x' be the smaller even number.\n* The next consecutive even number is 'x + 2'.\n**2. Set Up the Equation:**\n* The difference of their squares is 60, so we can write: (x + 2)\u00b2 - x\u00b2 = 60\n**3. Solve the Equation:**\n* Expand the equation: x\u00b2 + 4x + 4 - x\u00b2 = 60\n* Simplify: 4x + 4 = 60\n* Subtract 4 from both sides: 4x = 56\n* Divide both sides by 4: x = 14\n**4. Find the Other Number:**\n* The next consecutive even number is x + 2 = 14 + 2 = 16\n**5. Calculate the Sum:**\n* The sum of the two numbers is 14 + 16 = 30\n**Answer:** The sum of the original two numbers is **30**. \n",
