        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Set up the inequality:**\nWe want to find the time intervals where the height of the cannonball is greater than 6 meters.  This translates to the inequality:\n  -4.9t\u00b2 + 14t - 0.4 > 6\n**2. Simplify the inequality:**\nSubtract 6 from both sides:\n -4.9t\u00b2 + 14t - 6.4 > 0\n**3. Solve the quadratic inequality:**\n* **Find the roots:**  Treat the inequality as an equation and solve for t:\n   -4.9t\u00b2 + 14t - 6.4 = 0 \n   You can use the quadratic formula to find the roots:\n   t = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n   Where a = -4.9, b = 14, and c = -6.4\n   \n* **Test intervals:** The roots you find will divide the number line into intervals.  Choose a test value within each interval and plug it into the original inequality ( -4.9t\u00b2 + 14t - 6.4 > 0) to see if it makes the inequality true or false. \n   \n* **Identify the solution:** The intervals where the inequality is true represent the time periods when the cannonball is above 6 meters. \n**4. Express the answer as an improper fraction:**\nOnce you've found the time intervals, calculate the difference between the endpoints of the interval.  Express this difference as an improper fraction.\n**Important Note:** You might find that the cannonball reaches a height of 6 meters at two different times.  The time it spends above 6 meters will be the difference between those two times. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Set up the inequality:**\nWe want to find the time intervals where the height,  $h(t)$, is greater than 6 meters. So, we set up the inequality:\n$-4.9t^2 + 14t - 0.4 > 6$\n**2. Simplify the inequality:**\nSubtract 6 from both sides to get:\n$-4.9t^2 + 14t - 6.4 > 0$\n**3. Solve the quadratic inequality:**\nTo find the time intervals, we need to solve the quadratic inequality. Here's how:\n* **Find the roots:**  We can use the quadratic formula to find the roots of the equation $-4.9t^2 + 14t - 6.4 = 0$. The quadratic formula is:\n   $t = \\dfrac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$\n   where $a = -4.9$, $b = 14$, and $c = -6.4$\n* **Calculate the roots:** Substitute the values and calculate:\n   $t = \\dfrac{-14 \\pm \\sqrt{14^2 - 4(-4.9)(-6.4)}}{2(-4.9)}$\n   $t = \\dfrac{-14 \\pm \\sqrt{44.16}}{-9.8}$\n   $t = \\dfrac{-14 \\pm 6.64}{-9.8}$\n   This gives us two roots:\n   * $t_1 \\approx 0.75$ seconds\n   * $t_2 \\approx 1.73$ seconds\n* **Determine the intervals:** The roots divide the time axis into three intervals: \n    *  $t < 0.75$\n    *  $0.75 < t < 1.73$\n    *  $t > 1.73$\n* **Test each interval:** Pick a test value within each interval and substitute it into the inequality $-4.9t^2 + 14t - 6.4 > 0$ to see if it holds true.  \n    *  For $t < 0.75$, let's try $t = 0$:  $-4.9(0)^2 + 14(0) - 6.4 > 0$  (False)\n    *  For $0.75 < t < 1.73$, let's try $t = 1$: $-4.9(1)^2 + 14(1) - 6.4 > 0$  (True)\n    *  For $t > 1.73$, let's try $t = 2$: $-4.9(2)^2 + 14(2) - 6.4 > 0$  (False)\n**4. Express the solution:**\nThe cannonball is above 6 meters during the interval  $0.75 < t < 1.73$ seconds.  \n**5. Calculate the time interval:**\nThe length of the interval is $1.73 - 0.75 = 0.98$ seconds.\n**6. Convert to an improper fraction:**\n$0.98 = \\dfrac{98}{100} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{49}{50}}$ seconds. \n",
