    "solution": "Since $-\\frac58$ is a negative number, $f(x)$ is only defined for integer values of $x$, and will alternate between positive and negative values. Additionally, $\\left|-\\frac58\\right|< 1$, so $|f(x)|$ will continually decrease and approach 0 as $x$ increases in the interval $x\\ge0$. Therefore, the largest positive value will occur at $x=0$, giving us the positive upper bound of $\\left\\lfloor\\left(-\\frac58\\right)^0\\right\\rfloor=1$. The negative value that is greatest in magnitude then occurs at the next integer value of $x$: $x=1$, giving us the negative lower bound of $\\left\\lfloor\\left(-\\frac58\\right)^1\\right\\rfloor=-1$. This tells us that $-1 \\le f(x) \\le 1$. Since the $f(x)$ must be an integer, the only possible distinct values contained in the range are -1, 0, and 1. This gives us a total of $\\boxed{3}$ values of $f(x)$ when $x\\ge0$.",

        "Here's a step-by-step solution to find the number of distinct values in the range of the function:\n**Understanding the Function**\n* **Floor Function:** The floor function, denoted by  $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$, gives the greatest integer less than or equal to *x*.  For example, $\\lfloor 3.7 \\rfloor = 3$ and $\\lfloor -2.3 \\rfloor = -3$.\n* **Base:**  The base of our exponential function is (-5/8), which is a fraction between -1 and 0. This means the function will produce values that are:\n    * **Decreasing:** As *x* increases, the value of (-5/8)^*x* gets smaller and smaller.\n    * **Positive:** The negative sign in the base is raised to an even power (since *x* is non-negative), making the result always positive.\n**Analyzing the Range**\n1. **Starting Point:** When *x* = 0,  we have  *f*(0) = \u230a(-5/8)^0\u230b = \u230a1\u230b = 1.\n2. **Decreasing Values:** As *x* increases, the value of (-5/8)^*x* decreases.  Consider the range of values:\n    *  1 > (-5/8)^*x*  > (5/8) \n    *  (5/8) > (-5/8)^*x*  > (5/8)^2 \n    *  (5/8)^2 > (-5/8)^*x*  > (5/8)^3\n    *  and so on...\n3. **Floor Function Impact:** Notice that as the value of (-5/8)^*x* decreases within each of these ranges, the floor function will always assign the same integer value. For example:\n    *  If 1 > (-5/8)^*x*  > (5/8), then \u230a(-5/8)^*x*\u230b = 0.\n    *  If (5/8) > (-5/8)^*x*  > (5/8)^2, then \u230a(-5/8)^*x*\u230b = 0.\n    *  And so on...\n**Conclusion**\nSince the function's values decrease towards 0, and the floor function assigns the same integer value within each decreasing range, the range of *f(x)* will consist of all the non-negative integers: {0, 1}. Therefore, there are **two** distinct values in the range of *f(x)*. \n",
        "Here's how we can solve the problem step-by-step:\n**Understanding the Function**\n* **Floor Function:** The floor function, denoted by  \u230a * \u230b, gives the greatest integer less than or equal to the input. For example, \u230a3.2\u230b = 3 and \u230a-2.7\u230b = -3.\n* **Base:** The base of the exponent, -5/8, is a fraction between -1 and 0.  This means its powers will get smaller and smaller as the exponent increases. \n**Analyzing the Behavior**\n1. **Starting Value:** When x = 0,  f(0) = \u230a(-5/8)\u2070\u230b = \u230a1\u230b = 1.\n2. **Decreasing Values:** As x increases, (-5/8)\u02e3 gets smaller and smaller, approaching zero.  This means the floor function will take on values of 0, -1, -2, and so on.  \n3. **Distinct Values:**  Notice that the floor function will only take on distinct integer values. The only question is how many such integers we can get. Since (-5/8)\u02e3 gets arbitrarily close to zero, the floor function will eventually reach -\u221e.\n**Conclusion**\nSince the function takes on all integer values from 1 to negative infinity, there are an **infinite** number of distinct values in the range of f(x). \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**Understanding the Function**\n* **Floor Function:** The floor function, denoted by  `\u230ax\u230b`, gives the greatest integer less than or equal to x. For example, \u230a3.7\u230b = 3 and \u230a-2.3\u230b = -3.\n* **Base:** The base of the exponent is (-5/8), which is a fraction between -1 and 0.  This means its absolute value is less than 1.\n**Behavior of the Function as x Increases**\n* As x increases, the value of (-5/8)^x gets smaller and smaller, approaching zero. \n* Since the base is negative, the function oscillates between positive and negative values, getting closer and closer to zero.\n**Determining the Range**\n1. **Initial Values:** \n   *  f(0) = \u230a(-5/8)^0\u230b = \u230a1\u230b = 1\n   *  f(1) = \u230a(-5/8)^1\u230b = \u230a-5/8\u230b = -1\n2. **Decreasing Values:** As x increases, the value of (-5/8)^x continues to decrease, getting closer to zero. Since the floor function takes the greatest integer less than or equal to the input, the output values will continue to decrease as well. \n3. **Convergence:**  As x approaches infinity, the value of (-5/8)^x approaches zero. This means the floor function will eventually output only the integer 0.\n**Conclusion**\nThe range of f(x) consists of all integers from 1 down to 0, including both 1 and 0.  Therefore, there are **2** distinct values in the range of f(x). \n",
