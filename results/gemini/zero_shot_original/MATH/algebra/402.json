        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand Inverse Proportionality:**\nInverse proportionality means that as one quantity increases, the other decreases at a rate that keeps their product constant.  Mathematically, this is represented as:\n*  *p* *q* = *k*  (where *k* is a constant)\n**2. Find the Constant of Proportionality (k):**\n* We know *p* = 28 when *q* = 7. Substitute these values into the equation:\n   * 28 * 7 = *k*\n   * *k* = 196\n**3. Find p when q = 49:**\n* Now we know *k* = 196.  Substitute *q* = 49 into the equation and solve for *p*:\n   * *p* * 49 = 196\n   * *p* = 196 / 49\n   * *p* = 4\n**Therefore, the value of p when q = 49 is 4.** \n",
