        "Here's how to solve the problem step by step:\n**1. Understanding the Reflection**\nReflecting a parabola about the line y = k means that each point on the original parabola is mirrored across this horizontal line.  The distance from a point on the original parabola to the line y = k is the same as the distance from the reflected point to the line y = k.\n**2. Using the Vertex**\nSince the vertex of the original parabola is (h, k), and the reflection is about the line y = k, the vertex of the reflected parabola remains at (h, k). This means the equation of the reflected parabola can be written in the form:\n  *  y = d(x - h)^2 + k \n**3. Relating the Coefficients**\nNow we need to relate the coefficients a, b, c, d, e, and f.  We can expand the equation of the reflected parabola:\n  * y = d(x^2 - 2hx + h^2) + k\n  * y = dx^2 - 2dhx + dh^2 + k \nComparing this to the given form of the reflected parabola, y = dx^2 + ex + f, we get:\n  * e = -2dh\n  * f = dh^2 + k\n**4. Finding the Value of a + b + c + d + e + f**\nWe know the original parabola is y = ax^2 + bx + c. Since the vertex is (h, k), we can use the vertex form of a parabola to write:\n  * y = a(x - h)^2 + k\n  * y = a(x^2 - 2hx + h^2) + k\n  * y = ax^2 - 2ahx + ah^2 + k\nComparing this to the standard form, we get:\n  * b = -2ah\n  * c = ah^2 + k\nNow, let's add the coefficients:\n  * a + b + c + d + e + f = a - 2ah + ah^2 + k + d - 2dh + dh^2 + k\nSimplifying, we get:\n  * a + b + c + d + e + f = **a + d + 2k**\n**Therefore, the value of a + b + c + d + e + f in terms of k is a + d + 2k.** \n",
        "Here's a step-by-step solution:\n**1. Understanding the Reflection**\nReflecting a parabola about the line  y = k means that each point on the original parabola is moved vertically by a distance equal to twice the difference between its y-coordinate and k. \n**2. Finding the Equation of the Reflected Parabola**\nLet (x, y) be a point on the original parabola.  Its reflection about y = k will have coordinates (x, 2k - y).  Since this reflected point lies on the parabola with equation y = dx\u00b2 + ex + f, we have:\n2k - y = dx\u00b2 + ex + f\n**3. Using the Vertex**\nWe know the vertex of the original parabola is (h, k).  Since the vertex is the point where the parabola changes direction, it will also be the vertex of the reflected parabola.  Therefore, the vertex of the reflected parabola is also (h, k).\n**4.  Relating the Coefficients**\nWe can substitute the original equation y = ax\u00b2 + bx + c into the reflection equation:\n2k - (ax\u00b2 + bx + c) = dx\u00b2 + ex + f\nSimplifying, we get:\n(a + d)x\u00b2 + (b + e)x + (c + f - 2k) = 0\nSince this equation holds for all values of x, the coefficients of x\u00b2 and x must be zero. This gives us:\na + d = 0\nb + e = 0\n**5.  Finding a + b + c + d + e + f**\nFrom the equations above, we have:\nd = -a\ne = -b\nSubstituting these into the equation (c + f - 2k) = 0, we get:\nc + f = 2k\nFinally, adding the equations a + d = 0, b + e = 0, and c + f = 2k, we obtain:\na + b + c + d + e + f = **2k** \n",
        "Here's a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n**1. Understand the Transformation**\nReflecting a parabola about the line y = k means flipping the parabola over this horizontal line.  This leaves the x-coordinate of each point unchanged, but negates the difference between the y-coordinate and k.\n**2. Find the Equation of the Reflected Parabola**\nLet's take an arbitrary point (x, y) on the original parabola. Its reflection will be (x, 2k - y). \nSince (x, y) lies on the original parabola, it satisfies the equation: \ny = ax\u00b2 + bx + c\nSubstituting y = 2k - y in the above equation, we get:\n2k - y = ax\u00b2 + bx + c\nSolving for y, we get the equation of the reflected parabola:\ny = 2k - ax\u00b2 - bx - c \nThis is the equation of the reflected parabola in terms of a, b, c, and k. We can now compare this to the given equation y = dx\u00b2 + ex + f to find the values of d, e, and f.\n**3. Relate the Coefficients**\nComparing the coefficients of the two equations, we see that:\n* d = -a \n* e = -b\n* f = 2k - c\n**4. Calculate the Sum**\nNow we can calculate the sum a + b + c + d + e + f:\na + b + c + d + e + f = a + b + c - a - b + 2k - c \n**5. Simplify**\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\na + b + c + d + e + f = **2k**\n**Therefore, the value of a + b + c + d + e + f is 2k.** \n",
        "Here's a step-by-step solution to find the value of  $a+b+c+d+e+f$:\n**1. Understanding the Reflection**\nReflecting a parabola about the line  $y = k$ means that for every point $(x,y)$ on the original parabola, there's a corresponding point $(x, 2k-y)$ on the reflected parabola. \n**2. Using the Vertex**\nSince the vertex of the original parabola is $(h,k)$, the vertex of the reflected parabola is also $(h,k)$. This is because the reflection line passes through the vertex.\n**3. Finding the Equations**\n* **Original Parabola:** The vertex form of a parabola is $y = a(x-h)^2 + k$.  Since the vertex is $(h,k)$, the original parabola has the equation: \n   *  $y = a(x-h)^2 + k$ \n* **Reflected Parabola:** Since the vertex of the reflected parabola is also $(h,k)$, we can write its equation in vertex form as well:\n   *  $y = d(x-h)^2 + k$\n**4. Relating the Coefficients**\nNow, we know that for any point $(x,y)$ on the original parabola, its reflection is $(x, 2k-y)$.  Let's substitute this into the equation of the reflected parabola:\n*  $2k - y = d(x-h)^2 + k$\nNow, substitute the equation of the original parabola for $y$:\n*  $2k - [a(x-h)^2 + k] = d(x-h)^2 + k$\nSimplifying, we get:\n*  $k - a(x-h)^2 = d(x-h)^2 + k$\n*  $-a(x-h)^2 = d(x-h)^2$\nSince this equation must hold for all values of $x$, we can conclude that:\n*  $d = -a$\n**5. Expanding and Comparing**\nNow, let's expand the original and reflected parabolas to get the standard form:\n* **Original Parabola:** \n   * $y = a(x^2 - 2hx + h^2) + k$\n   * $y = ax^2 - 2ahx + ah^2 + k$ \n   *  $y = ax^2 + (-2ah)x + (ah^2 + k)$ \n* **Reflected Parabola:**\n   *  $y = d(x^2 - 2hx + h^2) + k$\n   *  $y = dx^2 - 2dhx + dh^2 + k$\n   *  $y = dx^2 + (-2dh)x + (dh^2 + k)$\nComparing coefficients, we see:\n*  $b = -2ah$\n*  $c = ah^2 + k$\n*  $e = -2dh$\n*  $f = dh^2 + k$\n**6. Calculating the Sum**\nFinally, let's find $a + b + c + d + e + f$:\n*  $a + b + c + d + e + f = a - 2ah + ah^2 + k - a - 2dh + dh^2 + k$\nSince $d = -a$, we can simplify:\n*  $a + b + c + d + e + f = 2k$\n**Answer**\nTherefore, $a + b + c + d + e + f = \\boxed{2k}$. \n",
        "Here's a step-by-step solution:\n**1. Understanding Reflections**\nWhen a parabola is reflected across a horizontal line, the vertex stays in the same place, but the coefficient of the $x^2$ term changes sign.\n**2. Applying the Reflection**\n* Since the vertex of the original parabola is $(h,k)$, the vertex of the reflected parabola is also $(h,k)$.  \n* The original parabola has the equation $y = ax^2 + bx + c$.\n* The reflected parabola has the equation $y = -ax^2 + bx + c$ (notice the change in the coefficient of the $x^2$ term).\n**3. Comparing Coefficients**\nWe are told the reflected parabola has the equation $y = dx^2 + ex + f$. Comparing this to the equation we found in step 2:\n* $d = -a$\n* $e = b$\n* $f = c$\n**4. Calculating the Sum**\nWe want to find the value of $a + b + c + d + e + f$. Substituting the values we found:\n* $a + b + c + d + e + f = a + b + c + (-a) + b + c = **2b + 2c**$\n**5. Expressing in Terms of k**\nWe need to find a way to express $b$ and $c$ in terms of $k$.  Recall that the vertex of the original parabola is $(h,k)$.  This means the vertex form of the parabola is:\n* $y = a(x-h)^2 + k$\nExpanding this equation, we get:\n* $y = ax^2 - 2ahx + ah^2 + k$\nComparing this to the original equation $y = ax^2 + bx + c$, we see:\n* $b = -2ah$\n* $c = ah^2 + k$\n**6. Final Calculation**\nSubstituting these values into our expression for the sum:\n* $2b + 2c = 2(-2ah) + 2(ah^2 + k) = **2k**$\nTherefore, the value of $a + b + c + d + e + f$ is **2k**. \n"
