    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The only way that 5 can be expressed as the product of two positive integers is as $5 = 1 \\times 5$.  Therefore, the first and third terms are 1 and 5, in some order.  Since all the terms in the sequence are positive integers, the common difference must be nonnegative, so the first term is 1, and the third term is 5.\n\nThen the second term is the average of the first term (namely 1) and the third term (namely 5), or $(1 + 5)/2 = 3$.  Therefore, the common difference is $3 - 1 = 2$, and the fourth term is $5 + 2 = \\boxed{7}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand Arithmetic Sequences**\nAn arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers where the difference between any two consecutive terms is constant. This constant difference is called the common difference.\n**2. Set Up the Problem**\nLet the first term of the arithmetic sequence be  *a* and the common difference be *d*.  Then the first three terms are:\n*  *a* \n*  *a + d*\n*  *a + 2d*\nWe are given that the product of the first and third terms is 5:\n*  *a*(a + 2d) = 5\n**3. Find Possible Values for a and d**\nSince all terms are positive integers, we need to find factors of 5 that will work in our equation.  The only factors of 5 are 1 and 5.\n* **Case 1:**  *a* = 1 and *a + 2d* = 5.  Solving for *d* gives *d* = 2.\n* **Case 2:**  *a* = 5 and *a + 2d* = 1. This case is not possible since it would lead to a negative common difference.\n**4. Find the Fourth Term**\nSince the only valid case is *a* = 1 and *d* = 2, the fourth term is:\n*  *a + 3d* = 1 + 3(2) = **7**\n**Therefore, the fourth term of the arithmetic sequence is 7.** \n",

Analyze the Equation**\n* **Factorization:** The equation suggests that we need to find two factors of 5.  Since all terms are positive integers, the only possible factors are 1 and 5.\n**4.
