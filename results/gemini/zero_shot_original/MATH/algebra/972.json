        "Here's how to solve for *x*:\n1. **Simplify the expression:**  \n   The cube root of something times the square root of the same thing is the same as the fifth root of that thing:\n   \u221a[3](x\u221ax) =  \u221a[5](x * x) = \u221a[5](x\u00b2)\n2. **Isolate the variable:**\n   Now we have: \u221a[5](x\u00b2) = 7\n   To get rid of the fifth root, raise both sides to the power of 5:\n   (\u221a[5](x\u00b2))\u2075 = 7\u2075\n3. **Solve for x:**\n   This simplifies to: x\u00b2 = 16,807\n   Take the square root of both sides: x = \u00b1\u221a16,807 \n   Since we are dealing with a cube root, the solution must be positive.\nTherefore, the value of *x* that satisfies the equation is **x = \u221a16,807**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n1. **Simplify the expression:**  \n   The cube root and square root can be combined: \n   \u221a[3]{x\u221ax} = \u221a[3]{x^(1+1/2)} = \u221a[3]{x^(3/2)}\n2. **Apply the property of radicals:** \n   \u221a[3]{x^(3/2)} = (x^(3/2))^(1/3) = x^(3/2 * 1/3) = x^(1/2)\n3. **Solve for x:**\n   We now have the equation: x^(1/2) = 7\n   To get rid of the square root, square both sides: \n   (x^(1/2))^2 = 7^2\n   x = 49\n**Therefore, the value of x that satisfies the equation is 49.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n1. **Simplify the expression:**\n   *  Notice that  \u221ax can be written as x^(1/2).  \n   *  Therefore, the expression becomes:  \u221a[3]{x * x^(1/2)} = \u221a[3]{x^(3/2)}\n2. **Isolate the cube root:**\n   *  Since we want to find the value of 'x', we need to get rid of the cube root. To do this, cube both sides of the equation:\n      (\u221a[3]{x^(3/2)})^3 = 7^3\n      x^(3/2) = 343\n3. **Solve for x:**\n   *  To get rid of the fractional exponent, raise both sides to the power of (2/3):\n      (x^(3/2))^(2/3) = 343^(2/3)\n      x = 49 \n**Therefore, the value of x that satisfies the equation is 49.** \n",
