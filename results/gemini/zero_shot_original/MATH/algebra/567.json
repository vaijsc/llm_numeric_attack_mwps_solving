        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n* **Find the conversion factor:**  We know 60 miles per hour is equivalent to 88 feet per second. This means that every 1 mile per hour is equal to 88/60 feet per second.\n* **Simplify the conversion factor:**  Divide both the numerator and denominator of 88/60 by their greatest common factor, 4. This gives us a conversion factor of 22/15 feet per second per mile per hour.\n* **Multiply to find the new speed:**  Multiply the conversion factor by the new speed (66 miles per hour):  (22/15 feet per second per mile per hour) * (66 miles per hour) = 96.8 feet per second.\n**Therefore, 66 miles per hour is approximately 96.8 feet per second.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the conversion factor:**\n* We know 60 miles per hour is equal to 88 feet per second.  This gives us a conversion factor: \n   * 60 miles/hour = 88 feet/second\n**2. Set up a proportion:**\n* We want to find the speed in feet per second for 66 miles per hour. Let 'x' represent the unknown speed.  We can set up a proportion:\n   * 60 miles/hour / 88 feet/second = 66 miles/hour / x feet/second\n**3. Solve for x:**\n* Cross-multiply: \n   * 60 * x = 66 * 88\n* Simplify: \n   * 60x = 5808\n* Divide both sides by 60:\n   * x = 96.8 \n**Answer:** 66 miles per hour is approximately **96.8** feet per second. \n",
