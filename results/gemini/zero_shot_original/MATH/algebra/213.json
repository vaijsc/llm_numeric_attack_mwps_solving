When $x\\ge 0$, $y=|x|=x$. Plugging this into the second equation to eliminate $y$, we get $x=-x^2+\\frac{35}{4}\\Rightarrow x^2+x-\\frac{35}{4}=0$. Factoring the left hand side gives $\\left(x+\\frac{7}{2}\\right)\\left(x-\\frac{5}{2}\\right)=0$, so $x=2.5$ (since we stated that $x$ was non-negative).

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Region**\n* **y = |x|:**  This is a \"V\" shape with its vertex at the origin.\n* **y = -x\u00b2 + 35/4:**  This is a parabola opening downwards, with its vertex at (0, 35/4).\nThe region we're interested in is the area enclosed between these two graphs.\n**2. Find the Intersection Points**\nTo determine the exact boundaries of the region, we need to find where the two graphs intersect.  \n* **Solve for x:** Set the equations equal to each other: \n   |x| = -x\u00b2 + 35/4\n* **Consider Cases:** Since we have an absolute value, we need to consider two cases:\n    * **Case 1: x \u2265 0:**  x = -x\u00b2 + 35/4. This simplifies to x\u00b2 + x - 35/4 = 0. Solving this quadratic equation gives us x = 5/2 or x = -7/2.  Since x \u2265 0, we discard x = -7/2.\n    * **Case 2: x < 0:**  -x = -x\u00b2 + 35/4. This simplifies to x\u00b2 - x - 35/4 = 0. Solving this quadratic equation gives us x = -5/2 or x = 7/2. Since x < 0, we discard x = 7/2.\n* **Intersection Points:** We found the intersection points to be (5/2, 5/2) and (-5/2, 5/2).\n**3. Count the Lattice Points**\nNow we need to count the lattice points (points with integer coordinates) within this region.\n* **Consider the Rectangle:** Notice that the region fits within a rectangle with vertices (-5/2, 0), (5/2, 0), (5/2, 35/4), and (-5/2, 35/4).\n* **Count by Rows:** We can count lattice points by considering each row within this rectangle:\n    * **y = 0:**  We have lattice points at x = -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2. That's 5 points.\n    * **y = 1:**  We have lattice points at x = -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2. That's 5 points.\n    * **y = 2:**  We have lattice points at x = -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2. That's 5 points.\n    * **y = 3:**  We have lattice points at x = -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2. That's 5 points.\n    * **y = 4:**  We have lattice points at x = -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2. That's 5 points.\n    * **y = 5:**  We have lattice points at x = -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2. That's 5 points.\n    * **y = 6:**  We have lattice points at x = -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2. That's 5 points.\n    * **y = 7:**  We have lattice points at x = -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2. That's 5 points.\n    * **y = 8:**  We have no lattice points in this row because the parabola cuts off the region.\n* **Total Count:** We have 5 points in each of the first 8 rows, totaling 40 points. However, we need to subtract any points that lie *outside* our region:\n    * **y = 5:** We need to remove the points (3, 5) and (-3, 5) as they lie above the parabola.\n    * **y = 6:**  We need to remove the points (2, 6) and (-2, 6) as they lie above the parabola.\n    * **y = 7:** We need to remove the points (1, 7) and (-1, 7) as they lie above the parabola. \n**4. Final Answer**\nWe started with 40 lattice points and removed 6, leaving us with **34 lattice points** inside or on the boundary of the region. \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Graph**\n* **y = |x|:** This is the absolute value function, forming a V-shape with its vertex at the origin.\n* **y = -x\u00b2 + 35/4:** This is a parabola opening downwards, with its vertex at (0, 35/4). \n**2. Find the Intersection Points**\nTo find where the two graphs intersect, we need to solve the system of equations:\n*  y = |x|\n*  y = -x\u00b2 + 35/4\n**Case 1: x \u2265 0**\n*  y = x\n*  x = -x\u00b2 + 35/4\nSolving this quadratic, we get x = 5/2 or x = -7/2.  Since we're considering x \u2265 0, we take x = 5/2.  This gives us the intersection point (5/2, 5/2).\n**Case 2: x < 0**\n*  y = -x\n*  -x = -x\u00b2 + 35/4\nSolving this quadratic, we get x = 7/2 or x = -5/2.  Since we're considering x < 0, we take x = -5/2. This gives us the intersection point (-5/2, 5/2).\n**3. Determine the Region**\nThe region we're interested in is bounded by the parabola and the absolute value function.  It looks like a \"bowl\" shape.\n**4. Count Lattice Points**\nWe need to count the lattice points (points with integer coordinates) within this region. Let's consider the x-values:\n* **x = 0:** The parabola intersects the y-axis at y = 35/4.  We have lattice points at (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8). \n* **x = 1:**  The parabola is below the absolute value function for x = 1. We have the lattice point (1, 1).\n* **x = 2:** The parabola is below the absolute value function for x = 2. We have the lattice point (2, 2).\n* **x = 3:**  The parabola is below the absolute value function for x = 3. We have the lattice point (3, 3).\n* **x = 4:** The parabola is below the absolute value function for x = 4. We have the lattice point (4, 4).\n* **x = 5:** The parabola is below the absolute value function for x = 5. We have the lattice point (5, 5).\nNow, due to symmetry, we also have these lattice points:\n* **x = -1:** (-1, 1)\n* **x = -2:** (-2, 2)\n* **x = -3:** (-3, 3)\n* **x = -4:** (-4, 4)\n* **x = -5:** (-5, 5)\n**5. Total Count**\nAdding up all the lattice points we found, we have a total of **19** lattice points on the boundary or inside the region. \n",

Find the Intersection Points**\nTo find where the graphs intersect, we need to solve the equations simultaneously:\n* **Case 1: x \u2265 0**\n   *  y = x \n   *  y = -x^2 + 35/4\n   *  Substituting, we get x = -x^2 + 35/4 \n   *  Rearranging, we get x^2 + x - 35/4 = 0\n   *  This factors as (x + 7/2)(x - 5/2) = 0\n   *  The solution in this case is x = 5/2 (since x \u2265 0)\n* **Case 2: x < 0**\n   * y = -x\n   * y = -x^2 + 35/4\n   * Substituting, we get -x = -x^2 + 35/4\n   *  Rearranging, we get x^2 - x - 35/4 = 0\n   *  This factors as (x - 7/2)(x + 5/2) = 0\n   *  The solution in this case is x = -5/2 (since x < 0)\nTherefore, the intersection points are (5/2, 5/2) and (-5/2, 5/2).\n**3. Analyze the Region**\n* **Symmetry:** The region is symmetric about the y-axis.\n* **Lattice Points:** We need to count lattice points within the region.  Let's focus on the right half (x \u2265 0) and then double the count. \n**4. Count Lattice Points**\n* **Vertical Lines:** Draw vertical lines at x = 1, x = 2, and so on, up to x = 2 (since the intersection point is at x = 5/2).\n* **Horizontal Lines:** Draw horizontal lines at y = 1, y = 2, and so on, up to y = 3 (since the parabola intersects the y-axis at y = 35/4).\n* **Count:** For each vertical line, count the lattice points within the region that lie on that line.\n**5. Summarize the Count**\n* **x = 1:**  1 lattice point\n* **x = 2:**  2 lattice points\n* **x = 5/2:** 2 lattice points\nSince the region is symmetric, double this count to include the left half:\nTotal lattice points = 2 * (1 + 2 + 2) = **10**\n**Therefore, there are 10 lattice points on the boundary or inside the region bounded by the given curves.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Region**\n* **Graph the functions:**  \n    *  y = |x| is a V-shaped graph with its vertex at the origin.\n    *  y = -x\u00b2 + 35/4 is a downward-facing parabola with its vertex at (0, 35/4).\n* **Find the points of intersection:** \n    *  To find where the graphs intersect, set the equations equal to each other: \n       |x| = -x\u00b2 + 35/4\n    *  This equation has three solutions: x = -5/2, x = 0, and x = 5/2.  \n    *  These points of intersection will be the corners of the region.\n**2. Analyze the Lattice Points**\n* **Symmetry:** The graph is symmetrical about the y-axis.  This means we only need to count lattice points in the first quadrant and multiply our answer by 2.\n* **Focus on the first quadrant:**  We're looking for lattice points within the region defined by:\n    * y = x (the positive branch of y = |x|)\n    * y = -x\u00b2 + 35/4 \n**3. Count the Lattice Points**\n* **The parabola:**  The parabola intersects the line y = x at x = 5/2.  Since the vertex of the parabola is at (0, 35/4), it's clear that the only lattice point on the parabola in the first quadrant is (1, 31/4). However, this point lies *outside* the region defined by y = x. \n* **The line y = x:** Consider the line y = x.  We need to find the lattice points that lie between (0,0) and (5/2, 5/2).  The lattice points on this line segment are (1,1) and (2,2).\n**4. Calculate the Total**\n* **First Quadrant:** We found two lattice points in the first quadrant. \n* **Total:** Since the graph is symmetrical, we multiply by 2 to get 2 * 2 = **4** lattice points in total.\n**Therefore, there are 4 lattice points on the boundary or inside the region bounded by the given curves.** \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Graphs**\n* **y = |x|:** This is the absolute value function, which creates a V-shape with its vertex at the origin (0,0).\n* **y = -x\u00b2 + 35/4:** This is a downward-facing parabola with its vertex at (0, 35/4).\n**2. Find the Points of Intersection**\nTo find where the two graphs intersect, set the equations equal to each other:\n|x| = -x\u00b2 + 35/4\nWe need to consider two cases:\n* **Case 1: x \u2265 0:**  The equation becomes x = -x\u00b2 + 35/4. Rearranging, we get x\u00b2 + x - 35/4 = 0.  Solving this quadratic equation, we find x = 5/2 and x = -7/2. Since we're considering x \u2265 0, the only valid solution is x = 5/2. \n* **Case 2: x < 0:** The equation becomes -x = -x\u00b2 + 35/4. Rearranging, we get x\u00b2 - x - 35/4 = 0. Solving this quadratic equation, we find x = -5/2 and x = 7/2. Since we're considering x < 0, the only valid solution is x = -5/2.\nNow, we can find the corresponding y-values by plugging these x-values back into either of the original equations.  We find the points of intersection are:\n* (5/2, 5/2)\n* (-5/2, 5/2)\n**3. Visualize the Region**\nNow, sketch the graphs of the two functions. The region enclosed by the graphs is a symmetrical shape with its base on the x-axis and its top defined by the parabola. The points of intersection we found mark the corners of this region.\n**4. Count Lattice Points**\nWe need to count the lattice points (points with integer coordinates) inside or on the boundary of this region.  \n* **On the Parabola:**  Since the parabola is defined by a quadratic equation, we can find the integer x-values that will give us integer y-values.  The vertex of the parabola is at (0, 35/4), which is not a lattice point.  Since the parabola is symmetric, we only need to consider the right half (x \u2265 0).  Try plugging in integer values for x (1, 2, 3, etc.) and see if the resulting y-values are integers. We find that the lattice points on the parabola are:\n   * (1, 8)\n   * (2, 3) \n* **On the Absolute Value Lines:** The lines y = x and y = -x consist entirely of lattice points. Since we only need to consider the region between x = -5/2 and x = 5/2, the lattice points on these lines are:\n   * (-2, 2), (-1, 1), (0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2)\n* **Inside the Region:** Since the boundary of the region is defined by the parabola and the absolute value lines, there are no lattice points inside the region. \n**5. Total Count**\nAdding up the lattice points we found:\n* On the parabola: 2 points\n* On the absolute value lines: 5 points\n* Inside the region: 0 points\nTotal lattice points: 2 + 5 + 0 = **7**\nTherefore, there are **7** lattice points on the boundary or inside the region bounded by the given equations. \n"
