    "problem": "Five aluminum cans can be recycled to make a new can. How many new cans can eventually be made from 125 aluminum cans? (Remember that the first new cans that are made can then be recycled into even newer cans!)",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We start with $125 = 5^3$ cans. After recycling these cans, we will have made $125\\cdot\\frac15 = 5^2$ new cans. We can then recycle these new cans to make $5^2\\cdot\\frac15 = 5$ new cans and then finally recycle these to make $5\\cdot \\frac15 = 1$ new can. So the total number of new cans is $5^2+5+1 = 25+5+1 = \\boxed{31}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n* **Step 1: Initial Recycling:** You start with 125 cans. You can make 125 / 5 = 25 new cans.\n* **Step 2: Recycling the New Cans:** You now have 25 new cans. You can recycle these to make 25 / 5 = 5 more new cans. \n* **Step 3: Recycling Again:** You have 5 new cans. You can recycle these to make 5 / 5 = 1 new can.\n**Total New Cans:** You can eventually make a total of 25 + 5 + 1 = **31 new cans**. \n",
