    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let $a$ be Andrew's age now and $g$ be his grandfather's age now. We are looking for the value of $a$. We can set up a system of two equations to represent the given information, as follows:\n\n\\begin{align*}\ng &= 8a \\\\\ng-a &= 56 \\\\\n\\end{align*}In particular, the second equation represents the grandfather's age $a$ years ago, when Andrew was born. To solve for $a$, we need to eliminate $g$ from the equations above. Substituting the first equation into the second to eliminate $g$, we get that $8a-a=56$ or $a=8$. Thus, Andrew is $\\boxed{8}$ years old now.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n* **Find Andrew's age when his grandfather was 56:**  Since Andrew's grandfather was 56 when Andrew was born, Andrew was 0 years old.\n* **Find the age difference:**  The age difference between Andrew and his grandfather is always the same.  His grandfather was 56 and Andrew was 0, so the difference is 56 years.\n* **Let's use a variable:**  Let 'x' represent Andrew's current age. \n* **Set up an equation:**  We know the grandfather's age is eight times Andrew's age. So, the grandfather's current age is 8x.  We also know the age difference is 56.  This can be expressed as: 8x - x = 56 \n* **Solve for x:**  Combine like terms: 7x = 56. Divide both sides by 7: x = 8\n**Therefore, Andrew is currently 8 years old.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n* **Understand the relationship:** We know Andrew's grandfather was 56 years old when Andrew was born.  This means their age difference is 56 years.\n* **Set up an equation:** Let Andrew's current age be \"x\". Since his grandfather is eight times his age, the grandfather's current age is \"8x\".\n* **Consider the age difference:** We know that the grandfather is always 56 years older than Andrew.  So, we can write the equation: 8x = x + 56\n* **Solve for x:**\n   * Subtract x from both sides: 7x = 56\n   * Divide both sides by 7: x = 8\n**Therefore, Andrew is currently 8 years old.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n* **Find Andrew's grandfather's age difference:**  When Andrew was born, his grandfather was 56 years old. Since Andrew's age is zero at birth, the age difference between them is 56 years.\n* **Set up an equation:** Let Andrew's current age be \"x\". We know his grandfather's age is eight times Andrew's age, so his grandfather's age is 8x. \n* **Solve for Andrew's age:** The age difference between them remains constant. So, we can write the equation: 8x - x = 56. This simplifies to 7x = 56. Dividing both sides by 7, we get x = 8.\n**Therefore, Andrew is now 8 years old.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find Andrew's age when his grandfather was 56:**\n* Since Andrew's grandfather was 56 when Andrew was born, Andrew was 0 years old at that time.\n**2. Figure out the age difference:**\n* The age difference between Andrew and his grandfather will always remain the same.  \n* When Andrew was born, his grandfather was 56, so the age difference is 56 years.\n**3. Set up an equation:**\n* Let Andrew's current age be represented by the variable \"x\".\n* Andrew's grandfather's age is eight times Andrew's age, so his grandfather is 8x years old.\n* We know the age difference is 56, so we can set up the equation: 8x - x = 56\n**4.
