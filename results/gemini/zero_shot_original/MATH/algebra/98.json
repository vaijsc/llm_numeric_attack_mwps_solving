    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Consider points $P$, $Q$, and $R$. If the slope between point $P$ and point $Q$ is the same as the slope between point $Q$ and point $R$, $P$, $Q$, and $R$ are collinear. So we must find the slopes between every pair of possible points. Let us name the points: $A=(2,2)$, $B=(9,11)$, $C=(5,7)$, and $D=(11,17)$. We make a chart of all possible pairs of points and calculate the slope:\n\n\\begin{tabular}{c|c}\nPoints& Slope \\\\ \\hline\n\\vspace{0.05in} A,B&$\\frac{11-2}{9-2}=\\frac{9}{7}$\\\\ \\vspace{0.05in}\n$A,C$&$\\frac{7-2}{5-2}=\\frac{5}{3}$\\\\ \\vspace{0.05in}\n$A,D$&$\\frac{17-2}{11-2}=\\frac{15}{9}=\\frac{5}{3}$\\\\ \\vspace{0.05in}\n$B,C$&$\\frac{7-11}{5-9}=\\frac{-4}{-4}=1$\\\\ \\vspace{0.05in}\n$B,D$&$\\frac{17-11}{11-9}=\\frac{6}{2}=3$\\\\ \\vspace{0.05in}\n$C,D$&$\\frac{17-7}{11-5}=\\frac{10}{6}=\\frac{5}{3}$\n\\end{tabular}As we can see, the slopes between $A$ and $C$, $A$ and $D$, and $C$ and $D$ are the same, so $A$, $C$, and $D$ lie on a line, Thus $B$, or the point $\\boxed{(9,11)}$, is not on the line.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Understand Slope:**\n*  A line has a constant slope.  The slope is the \"steepness\" of the line and is calculated as: \n   *  Slope (m) = (change in y) / (change in x) \n**2. Calculate Slopes:**\n* **Let's try the points (2,2) and (9,11):**\n   *  Slope = (11 - 2) / (9 - 2) = 9/7\n* **Let's try the points (2,2) and (5,7):**\n   *  Slope = (7 - 2) / (5 - 2) = 5/3\n* **Let's try the points (2,2) and (11,17):**\n   *  Slope = (17 - 2) / (11 - 2) = 15/9 = 5/3\n**3. Analyze the Slopes:**\n* Notice that the slopes between (2,2) and (5,7) and (2,2) and (11,17) are both 5/3.  This means these three points lie on the same line.\n**4.  The Answer:**\n* The point **(9,11)** does not have the same slope as the other three, so it's not on the same line. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Understand Slope**\n* The slope of a line tells us how steep it is. We can calculate the slope using two points on the line:\n   *  Slope (m) = (change in y) / (change in x) \n**2. Calculate Slopes**\n* **Let's start with points (2, 2) and (9, 11):**\n   *  m = (11 - 2) / (9 - 2) = 9/7\n* **Now, let's check if (5, 7) lies on the same line:**\n   *  m = (7 - 2) / (5 - 2) = 5/3. This is different from 9/7, so (5, 7) is not on the same line.\n**3. Check the Last Point**\n* It's not necessary to check the slope with (11, 17) because we already found one point that doesn't fit the pattern. \n**Answer:** The point **(5, 7)** is not on the same line as the other three points. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Understand the concept of slope:**\n* The slope of a line represents how steep it is.  \n*  A line with a constant slope means all the points on that line have the same rate of change between their x and y coordinates.\n**2. Calculate the slope between two points:**\n* Let's choose points (2, 2) and (9, 11).\n* The slope formula is: (change in y) / (change in x)\n* Slope = (11 - 2) / (9 - 2) = 9/7\n**3. Check if the other points have the same slope:**\n* **Point (5, 7):**\n    * Slope = (7 - 2) / (5 - 2) = 5/3. This is different from 9/7. \n* **Point (11, 17):**\n    * Slope = (17 - 2) / (11 - 2) = 15/9 = 5/3.  This is also different from 9/7.\n**4. Conclusion:**\n* Since points (5, 7) and (11, 17) have a different slope than the line passing through (2, 2) and (9, 11), they are not on the same line.\n**Answer:** The point **(5, 7)** is not on the line. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Concept of a Line**\nPoints on a line have a consistent relationship between their x and y coordinates. This relationship can be represented by a linear equation (in the form y = mx + b).\n**2.  Calculate Slope**\n* **Choose two points:** Let's start with (2,2) and (9,11).\n* **Slope formula:**  The slope (m) of a line is calculated as:  (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n* **Apply the formula:** (11 - 2) / (9 - 2) = 9/7 \n**3. Check if the Other Points Fit the Slope**\n* **Point (5,7):** \n    * (7 - 2) / (5 - 2) = 5/3. This slope is different, so (5,7) is not on the same line.\n* **Point (11,17):**\n    * (17 - 2) / (11 - 2) = 15/9 = 5/3.  This slope is also different, so (11,17) is not on the same line.\n**4. Conclusion**\nThe points (2,2), (9,11), and (11,17) all have the same slope of 5/3, indicating they lie on the same line. The point **(5,7)** is the one that does not fit the pattern and is therefore not on the line. \n",
