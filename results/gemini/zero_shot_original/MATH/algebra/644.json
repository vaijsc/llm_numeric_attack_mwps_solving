    "solution": "Call the primes $p$ and $q$. $1488=p^2-q^2=(p-q)\\cdot(p+q)$. If $p$ or $q$ was $2$, $p^2-q^2$ would be odd, so $p$ and $q$ are both odd numbers that are less than $50$. That means $p-q$ and $p+q$ are both even numbers that are less than $100$. $1488=2^4\\cdot3\\cdot31$, so $p+q$ or $p-q$ must be divisible by $31$. The only even multiple of $31$ that is less than $100$ is $62$ so one must equal $62$, and the other must be $1488/62=24$. So, $p=\\frac{62+24}{2}=43$ and $q=\\frac{62-24}{2}=19$. So, the primes are $\\boxed{19 \\text{ and }43}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Understand the Problem:**\nWe're given that the difference between the squares of two prime numbers is 1488.  We need to find these prime numbers, both of which are less than 50.\n**2. Set Up an Equation:**\nLet the two prime numbers be *p* and *q*. We can express the problem as an equation:\n* p\u00b2 - q\u00b2 = 1488\n**3. Factor the Equation:**\nThe left side of the equation is a difference of squares, which factors nicely:\n* (p + q)(p - q) = 1488\n**4. Find the Factors of 1488:**\nWe need to find pairs of factors of 1488.  Since *p* and *q* are prime, the factors must also be odd (since the difference of two primes will always be even).\nThe prime factorization of 1488 is 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 37.  Let's look for pairs of factors that are odd:\n* 1 x 1488 (not possible since one factor is even)\n* 3 x 496 (not possible since one factor is even)\n* **11 x 136** (possible - both factors are odd) \n**5. Solve for p and q:**\nWe have two equations:\n* p + q = 136\n* p - q = 11\nAdding these equations, we get:\n* 2p = 147\n* p = 73.5\nSince *p* must be a prime number, this solution is incorrect.  We need to try the other possible pair of factors.\n**6. Try the Other Pair of Factors:**\nSince our first attempt failed, let's try the other odd factor pair:\n* p + q = 136\n* p - q = 11\nAdding these equations, we get:\n* 2p = 147\n* p = 73.5\nAgain, this solution is incorrect.  This means our original assumption that the difference of squares of two primes less than 50 equals 1488 is incorrect. There are no such prime numbers. \n**Therefore, there is no solution to this problem.** \n",

Find Factors of 1488**\nWe need to find factors of 1488 that could represent (p + q) and (p - q).  Since both primes are less than 50, their sum (p + q) will also be less than 100. \nLet's find the factors of 1488:\n* 1488 = 1 x 1488\n* 1488 = 2 x 744\n* 1488 = 3 x 496\n* 1488 = 4 x 372\n* 1488 = 6 x 248\n* 1488 = 8 x 186\n* 1488 = 12 x 124\n* 1488 = 16 x 93\n* 1488 = 22 x 68\n* 1488 = 24 x 62\n* 1488 = 31 x 48\n**5. Check for Prime Numbers**\nWe need to look for factor pairs where:\n* The sum of the factors is less than 100.\n* Both factors, when divided by 2, result in prime numbers.\nLooking at the factors above, only the pair (22, 68) satisfies these conditions:\n* 22 + 68 = 90 (less than 100)\n* 22 / 2 = 11 (prime)\n* 68 / 2 = 34 (not prime)\n**6.  Solve for the Primes**\nWe have:\n* p + q = 68\n* p - q = 22\nAdding these equations, we get:\n* 2p = 90\n* p = 45\nSubstituting p = 45 into either of the original equations, we get:\n* 45 - q = 22\n* q = 23\n**Answer**\nThe two prime numbers are **23 and 45**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Understand the Problem**\nWe're given that the difference of the squares of two prime numbers is 1488.  We need to find these two prime numbers, knowing they are both less than 50.\n**2. Set Up the Equation**\nLet the two prime numbers be  'p' and 'q'. We can express the problem as an equation:\np\u00b2 - q\u00b2 = 1488\n**3. Factor the Equation**\nThe left side of the equation is a difference of squares, which factors nicely:\n(p + q)(p - q) = 1488\n**4. Find Factors of 1488**\nWe need to find pairs of factors of 1488.  Since 'p' and 'q' are prime, (p + q) and (p - q) must also be integers. \nLet's start by finding the prime factorization of 1488:\n1488 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 37\nNow, let's find the pairs of factors:\n* 1 x 1488\n* 2 x 744\n* 4 x 372\n* 6 x 248\n* 8 x 186\n* 12 x 124\n* 16 x 93\n* 24 x 62\n* 37 x 40 \n**5. Solve for 'p' and 'q'**\nWe need to find a pair of factors where one is the sum of two primes and the other is the difference.  The pair (40, 37) fits this condition:\n* (p + q) = 40\n* (p - q) = 37\nSolving these equations simultaneously, we get:\n* p = 38.5 \n* q = 1.5\nSince 'p' and 'q' must be prime numbers, this solution is not valid.  Let's try another pair of factors.\nThe pair (62, 24) works:\n* (p + q) = 62\n* (p - q) = 24\nSolving these equations simultaneously, we get:\n* p = 43\n* q = 19\n**6. Verify**\nBoth 43 and 19 are prime numbers less than 50.  Let's verify our solution:\n43\u00b2 - 19\u00b2 = 1849 - 361 = 1488\n**Answer**\nThe two prime numbers are **43, 19**. \n",

Find factors of 1488:**\nWe need to find pairs of factors of 1488 that could represent (p + q) and (p - q).  Since we know the primes are less than 50, the sum (p + q) must be less than 100.\n* Factors of 1488 include: (1, 1488), (2, 744), (3, 496), (4, 372), (6, 248), (8, 186), (12, 124), (16, 93), (22, 68), (29, 51), (34, 44)\n**5.

        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Understand the Problem:**\nWe're given that the difference of squares of two prime numbers is 1488.  This can be written as:\n* p\u00b2 - q\u00b2 = 1488 \nwhere 'p' and 'q' are the prime numbers.\n**2. Factor the Difference of Squares:**\nThe difference of squares factors nicely:\n* (p + q)(p - q) = 1488\n**3. Find Factors of 1488:**\nNow we need to find the factors of 1488.  Since we're dealing with prime numbers, we need to look for pairs of factors where one factor is slightly larger than the other. \nHere's a helpful trick: Start by dividing 1488 by 2, then by 4, and so on until you find factors that are close in value.  We find:\n* 1488 = 37 * 40\n**4. Solve for the Primes:**\nLet's set up two equations based on our factored equation:\n* p + q = 40\n* p - q = 37\nAdding these equations together, we get:\n* 2p = 77\n* p = 38.5\nSince 'p' must be a prime number, this solution doesn't work. \nLet's try another factor pair for 1488:\n* 1488 = 22 * 68 \nThis leads to:\n* p + q = 68\n* p - q = 22\nAdding these equations, we get:\n* 2p = 90\n* p = 45\nAgain, 'p' is not a prime number.  Let's continue trying factor pairs:\n* 1488 = 16 * 93\nThis leads to:\n* p + q = 93\n* p - q = 16\nAdding these equations, we get:\n* 2p = 109\n* p = 54.5\nAgain, 'p' is not a prime number.\n**5. The Key Insight:**\nNotice that all our attempts so far have resulted in 'p' being a non-prime number. This suggests we've been trying the factor pairs in the wrong order!  Remember, the problem states that *both* primes are less than 50. \nLet's reverse our approach and look for factor pairs of 1488 where the smaller factor is less than 50.  We find:\n* 1488 = 31 * 48\nNow we have:\n* p + q = 48\n* p - q = 31\nAdding these equations, we get:\n* 2p = 79\n* p = 39.5\nThis still doesn't work. \nFinally, we find:\n* 1488 = 29 * 51\nThis leads to:\n* p + q = 51\n* p - q = 29\nAdding these equations, we get:\n* 2p = 80\n* p = 40\nThis doesn't work either, as 40 is not prime.\n**6. The Solution:**\nWe've exhausted all the factor pairs of 1488.  Since none of them led to valid prime numbers, this means there is **no solution** to the problem. There are no two prime numbers less than 50 whose difference of squares is 1488. \n"
