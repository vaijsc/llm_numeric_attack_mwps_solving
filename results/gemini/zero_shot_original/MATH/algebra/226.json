        "Here's how to find the value of c step-by-step:\n1. **Substitute the known values:** We know that f(2) = 9. This means when x = 2, the function's output is 9. Let's substitute these values into the function: \n   \n   9 = c(2)\u00b3 - 9(2) + 3\n2. **Simplify the equation:**\n   9 = 8c - 18 + 3\n   9 = 8c - 15\n3. **Solve for c:** \n   9 + 15 = 8c\n   24 = 8c\n   c = 24/8 \n   c = 3\n**Therefore, the value of c is 3.** \n",
