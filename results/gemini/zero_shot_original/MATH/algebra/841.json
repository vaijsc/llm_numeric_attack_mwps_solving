    "solution": "Moving all the terms to the LHS, we have the equation $x^2-14x+y^2-48y=0$. Completing the square on the quadratic in $x$, we add $(14/2)^2=49$ to both sides. Completing the square on the quadratic in $y$, we add $(48/2)^2=576$ to both sides. We have the equation  \\[(x^2-14x+49)+(y^2-48y+576)=625 \\Rightarrow (x-7)^2+(y-24)^2=625\\]Rearranging, we have $(x-7)^2=625-(y-24)^2$. Taking the square root and solving for $x$, we get $x=\\pm \\sqrt{625-(y-24)^2}+7$. Since $\\sqrt{625-(y-24)^2}$ is always nonnegative, the minimum value of $x$ is achieved when we use a negative sign in front of the square root. Now, we want the largest possible value of the square root. In other words, we want to maximize $625-(y-24)^2$. Since $(y-24)^2$ is always nonnegative, $625-(y-24)^2$ is maximized when $(y-24)^2=0$ or when $y=24$. At this point, $625-(y-24)^2=625$ and $x=-\\sqrt{625}+7=-18$. Thus, the minimum $x$ value is $\\boxed{-18}$.\n\n--OR--\n\nSimilar to the solution above, we can complete the square to get the equation $(x-7)^2+(y-24)^2=625$. This equation describes a circle with center at $(7,24)$ and radius $\\sqrt{625}=25$. The minimum value of $x$ is achieved at the point on the left side of the circle, which is located at $(7-25,24)=(-18,24)$. Thus, the minimum value of $x$ is $\\boxed{-18}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Complete the Square**\nWe can find the minimum value of *x* by rewriting the equation in a way that highlights the relationship between *x* and *y*.  To do this, we'll complete the square for both *x* and *y*:\n* **For x:**  Move the *x* terms to the left side and complete the square:\n   \n   ```\n   x^2 - 14x + y^2 = 48y \n   x^2 - 14x + 49 + y^2 = 48y + 49 \n   (x - 7)^2 + y^2 = 48y + 49\n   ```\n* **For y:** Move the *y* terms to the right side and complete the square:\n   ```\n   (x - 7)^2 + y^2 - 48y = 49\n   (x - 7)^2 + y^2 - 48y + 576 = 49 + 576\n   (x - 7)^2 + (y - 24)^2 = 625\n   ```\n**2. Interpret the Equation**\nThe equation  (x - 7)^2 + (y - 24)^2 = 625 represents a circle centered at (7, 24) with a radius of 25. \n**3. Find the Minimum x**\nSince the circle is centered at (7, 24), the point on the circle with the smallest *x*-coordinate will be the point where the circle intersects the leftmost edge of the circle.  This point will be 25 units to the left of the center, meaning its *x*-coordinate is:\n   7 - 25 = **-18**\n**Therefore, the minimum value of *x* is -18.** \n",
