Set up the Equation**\nWe are given that the harmonic mean of *x* and *y* is 20.  Let's set up the equation:\n20 = 2 / (1/x + 1/y)\n**3. Simplify the Equation**\n* Multiply both sides by (1/x + 1/y): \n   20(1/x + 1/y) = 2\n* Divide both sides by 20:\n   (1/x + 1/y) = 1/10\n* Find a common denominator for the fractions on the left:\n   (y + x) / (xy) = 1/10\n**4. Cross-Multiply**\n* Cross-multiply to get rid of the fractions:\n   10(y + x) = xy\n**5. Rearrange the Equation**\n* Expand the left side:\n   10y + 10x = xy\n* Move all terms to one side:\n   xy - 10x - 10y = 0\n**6.

Find the Factors of 100**\nNow we need to find all the pairs of factors of 100. Remember that *x* and *y* are positive integers.  The factors of 100 are:\n* 1 and 100\n* 2 and 50\n* 4 and 25\n* 5 and 20\n* 10 and 10\n**8. Determine the Solutions**\nFor each pair of factors, we can solve for *x* and *y*:\n* (x - 10) = 1, (y - 10) = 100  =>  x = 11, y = 110\n* (x - 10) = 2, (y - 10) = 50  =>  x = 12, y = 60\n* (x - 10) = 4, (y - 10) = 25  =>  x = 14, y = 35\n* (x - 10) = 5, (y - 10) = 20  =>  x = 15, y = 30\n* (x - 10) = 10, (y - 10) = 10  =>  x = 20, y = 20\n**9.

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understanding the Harmonic Mean**\nThe harmonic mean of two numbers, *x* and *y*, is given by:\n```\nHarmonic Mean (x, y) = 2 / ((1/x) + (1/y)) \n```\n**2. Setting up the Equation**\nWe're given that the harmonic mean of *x* and *y* is 20.  So we have the equation:\n```\n20 = 2 / ((1/x) + (1/y)) \n```\n**3. Simplifying the Equation**\n* Multiply both sides by ((1/x) + (1/y)):  \n   10((1/x) + (1/y)) = 1 \n* Simplify the left side:\n   (10/x) + (10/y) = 1\n* Multiply both sides by *xy*:\n   10y + 10x = xy\n* Rearrange the terms:\n   xy - 10x - 10y = 0\n**4.

Finding the Factors of 100**\nNow we need to find all the pairs of positive integers that multiply to 100. These pairs will represent the possible values for (x - 10) and (y - 10).\nThe factors of 100 are:\n* 1 and 100\n* 2 and 50\n* 4 and 25\n* 5 and 20\n* 10 and 10\n**6. Determining the Solutions**\nFor each factor pair, we can solve for *x* and *y*:\n* **(x - 10, y - 10) = (1, 100)**  =>  (x, y) = (11, 110)\n* **(x - 10, y - 10) = (2, 50)**  =>  (x, y) = (12, 60)\n* **(x - 10, y - 10) = (4, 25)**  =>  (x, y) = (14, 35)\n* **(x - 10, y - 10) = (5, 20)**  =>  (x, y) = (15, 30)\n* **(x - 10, y - 10) = (10, 10)** =>  (x, y) = (20, 20)\n**7. Counting the Solutions**\nSince we are looking for *ordered* pairs, each of these pairs counts as a separate solution.  We have a total of **5** solutions.\n**Therefore, there are 5 ordered pairs (x, y) of positive integers where the harmonic mean of x and y is equal to 20.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Harmonic Mean**\nThe harmonic mean of two numbers, *x* and *y*, is defined as:\nHarmonic Mean (HM) =  2 / [(1/x) + (1/y)]\n**2. Set up the Equation**\nWe are given that the harmonic mean of *x* and *y* is 20. So, we can write the equation:\n20 = 2 / [(1/x) + (1/y)]\n**3. Simplify the Equation**\nMultiply both sides by [(1/x) + (1/y)] and divide both sides by 20:\n(1/x) + (1/y) = 1/10\n**4. Find a Common Denominator**\nTo combine the fractions on the left side, find a common denominator:\n(y + x) / (xy) = 1/10\n**5. Cross-Multiply**\nCross-multiply to get rid of the fractions:\n10(x + y) = xy\n**6. Rearrange the Equation**\nRearrange the equation to get a quadratic:\nxy - 10x - 10y = 0\n**7. Factor by Grouping**\nAdd 100 to both sides to complete the square:\nxy - 10x - 10y + 100 = 100\nFactor by grouping:\nx(y - 10) - 10(y - 10) = 100\n(x - 10)(y - 10) = 100\n**8. Find the Factors of 100**\nNow we need to find all the pairs of factors of 100.  Remember that *x* and *y* are positive integers.\nThe factors of 100 are: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, and 100.\n**9. Count the Possible Pairs**\nSince *x* and *y* can be in any order, we need to consider both (x, y) and (y, x).  For example, (11, 20) is a solution, as is (20, 11).  We can systematically count the pairs:\n* (11, 20) and (20, 11)\n* (12, 25) and (25, 12)\n* (15, 14) and (14, 15)\n* (20, 11) and (11, 20)\n* (25, 12) and (12, 25)\n* (50, 11) and (11, 50)\n* (101, 10) and (10, 101)\nThere are a total of **7** possible pairs of positive integers (x, y) where the harmonic mean is 20. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Set up the equation:**\nThe harmonic mean of *x* and *y* is given by:\n```\nHarmonic Mean (x, y) = 2 / (1/x + 1/y) \n```\nWe are given that the harmonic mean is 20, so:\n```\n20 = 2 / (1/x + 1/y)\n```\n**2. Simplify the equation:**\n* Multiply both sides by (1/x + 1/y): \n   20(1/x + 1/y) = 2\n* Divide both sides by 20:\n   (1/x + 1/y) = 1/10\n* Find a common denominator:\n   (y/xy + x/xy) = 1/10\n* Combine terms:\n   (x + y)/xy = 1/10\n**3.

Complete the square:**\n* To complete the square, we need to add a constant term to both sides of the equation.  We can do this by adding (10*10)/2 = 50 to both sides.  This will allow us to factor the left side of the equation:\n   xy - 10x - 10y + 50 = 50\n* Factor by grouping:\n   (x - 10)(y - 10) = 50\n**5. Find the factors of 50:**\nThe factors of 50 are: 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, and 50.  Since *x* and *y* are positive integers, we need to consider the positive factors of 50.\n**6. Count the possible pairs:**\nFor each factor *a* of 50, we have a pair (x, y) where:\n* x = a + 10\n* y = 50/a + 10\nWe need to be careful not to count any pairs twice.  For example, when a = 10, we get (x, y) = (20, 15).  However, when a = 5, we get (x, y) = (15, 20), which is the same pair.\nTherefore, the possible pairs are:\n* (11, 60)\n* (12, 55)\n* (15, 20) \n* (20, 15)\n* (25, 12)\n* (30, 11)\n**7.
