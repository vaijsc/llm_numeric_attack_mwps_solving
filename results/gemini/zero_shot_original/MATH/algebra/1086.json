        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Use the Vieta's formulas:**\n* **Sum of roots:**  For a quadratic equation of the form  *ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0*, the sum of the roots is -b/a. In our case, the sum of the roots is  *a + b = -a/1 = -a*.\n* **Product of roots:** The product of the roots is c/a. In our case, the product of the roots is *a * b = b/1 = b*.\n**2. Solve the system of equations:**\nWe now have two equations:\n*  a + b = -a \n*  ab = b\n**3.
