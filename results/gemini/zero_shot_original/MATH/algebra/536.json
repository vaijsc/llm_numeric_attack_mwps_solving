        "We can solve this quadratic equation by factoring.  We need to find two numbers that multiply to $24 \\cdot -20 = -480$ and add to 17.  After some trial and error, we find that 40 and $-12$ work:\n$$24x^2 + 40x - 12x - 20 = 0$$\nWe can now factor by grouping:\n$$8x(3x + 5) - 4(3x + 5) = 0$$\n$$(8x - 4)(3x + 5) = 0$$\nThis gives us the solutions $x = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $x = -\\frac{5}{3}$.  The smaller of these is $\\boxed{-\\frac{5}{3}}$. \n",
        "We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:\n$$x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$\nwhere $a = 24$, $b = 17$, and $c = -20$.  Substituting these values, we get:\n$$x = \\frac{-17 \\pm \\sqrt{17^2 - 4 \\cdot 24 \\cdot -20}}{2 \\cdot 24}$$\nSimplifying, we have:\n$$x = \\frac{-17 \\pm \\sqrt{2089}}{48}$$\nWe are looking for the smaller of the two roots, so we use the minus sign:\n$$x = \\frac{-17 - \\sqrt{2089}}{48}$$\nThe prime factorization of 2089 is $2089 = 23 \\cdot 91$, and 91 is not a perfect square. Therefore, the radical cannot be simplified further, and the smallest value of $x$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{-17 - \\sqrt{2089}}{48}}$. \n",
        "We can solve this quadratic equation by factoring.  We look for two numbers that multiply to $(24)(-20) = -480$ and add up to 17.  The numbers 32 and $-15$ work, so we can rewrite the equation as:\n$$24x^2 + 32x - 15x - 20 = 0$$\nNow we factor by grouping:\n$$8x(3x + 4) - 5(3x + 4) = 0$$\nThis gives us:\n$$(8x-5)(3x+4) = 0$$\nTherefore, $x = \\boxed{\\frac{5}{8}}$ or $x = -\\frac{4}{3}$.  The smaller of these two solutions is $\\frac{5}{8}$. \n",
