    "problem": "A TV screen measures 24 by 16 inches. If each dimension is increased by 20$\\%$, by what percent is the area increased?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since we're dealing with percentages, the actual dimensions do not matter. Let $l$ and $w$ represent the dimensions of the TV screen. The current area is $lw$. If we increase $l$ by $20\\%$, we end up with $l\\left(1+\\frac{20}{100}\\right)=l\\left(\\frac{10}{10}+\\frac{2}{10}\\right)=\\frac{12}{10}l$. Increasing the width results in $\\frac{12}{10}w$. The new area is $\\frac{12}{10}l\\times\\frac{12}{10}w=\\frac{144}{100}lw=lw\\left(1+\\frac{44}{100}\\right)$. The area increases by $\\boxed{44\\%}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this step-by-step:\n**1. Calculate the original area:**\n* Original area = length * width = 24 inches * 16 inches = 384 square inches\n**2. Calculate the increased dimensions:**\n* Increased length = 24 inches * 1.20 = 28.8 inches\n* Increased width = 16 inches * 1.20 = 19.2 inches\n**3. Calculate the new area:**\n* New area = increased length * increased width = 28.8 inches * 19.2 inches = 552.96 square inches\n**4. Calculate the increase in area:**\n* Increase in area = New area - Original area = 552.96 square inches - 384 square inches = 168.96 square inches\n**5. Calculate the percentage increase in area:**\n* Percentage increase = (Increase in area / Original area) * 100%\n* Percentage increase = (168.96 square inches / 384 square inches) * 100% \n* Percentage increase = **43.96%**\n**Therefore, the area of the TV screen is increased by approximately 43.96%.** \n",
