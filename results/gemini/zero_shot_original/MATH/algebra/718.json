    "problem": "Three plus the reciprocal of a number equals 7 divided by that number.  What is the number?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let $x$ be the number.  Converting the words in the problem into an equation gives us $3+\\dfrac{1}{x} = \\dfrac{7}{x}$.  Subtracting $\\dfrac{1}{x}$ from both sides gives $3 = \\dfrac{6}{x}$. Multiplying both sides of this equation by $x$ gives $3x =6$, and dividing both sides of this equation by 3 gives $x = \\boxed{2}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Translate the words into an equation:**\n* \"Three plus the reciprocal of a number\" translates to 3 + 1/x  (where 'x' is the unknown number)\n* \"equals 7 divided by that number\" translates to = 7/x\n**2. Set up the equation:**\n3 + 1/x = 7/x\n**3. Solve for x:**\n* Subtract 1/x from both sides: 3 = 6/x\n* Multiply both sides by x: 3x = 6\n* Divide both sides by 3: x = 2\n**Therefore, the number is 2.** \n",
