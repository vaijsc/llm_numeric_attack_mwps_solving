    "solution": "From the first equation, we can see that $y = 7 - x.$ Substituting for $y$ in the second equation, we obtain $3x + (7 - x) = 45,$ so $x = 19.$ We can then find that $y = -12.$ Thus, $$x^2 - y^2 = 19^2 - (-12)^2 = \\boxed{217}.$$- OR -\n\nNote that $$x^2 - y^2 = (x + y)(x - y).$$If we subtract two times the first equation from the second equation, we obtain $x - y = 31.$ We can then substitute for $x + y$ and $x - y$ to obtain $7\\cdot 31 = \\boxed{217}.$",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Solve for x and y:**\n* **Elimination Method:**  Subtract the first equation from the second equation:\n   (3x + y) - (x + y) = 45 - 7\n   2x = 38\n   x = 19\n* **Substitute to find y:**\n   Substitute x = 19 into either of the original equations. Let's use x + y = 7:\n   19 + y = 7\n   y = -12\n**2. Evaluate x\u00b2 - y\u00b2:**\n* Now that we know x = 19 and y = -12, substitute these values into the expression:\n   x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = (19)\u00b2 - (-12)\u00b2\n   = 361 - 144\n   = 217\n**Therefore, x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 217** \n",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Solve for x and y**\n* We have two equations and two unknowns, so we can solve for *x* and *y*. \n* Subtract the first equation from the second equation: \n   (3x + y) - (x + y) = 45 - 7\n* This simplifies to: 2x = 38\n* Divide both sides by 2 to get: x = 19\n* Substitute the value of *x* (19) back into either of the original equations to solve for *y*. Let's use the first equation:\n   19 + y = 7\n* Subtract 19 from both sides: y = -12\n**2. Evaluate x\u00b2 - y\u00b2**\n* Now that we know *x* = 19 and *y* = -12, we can plug these values into the expression:\n   x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = (19)\u00b2 - (-12)\u00b2\n* Calculate the squares: 361 - 144\n* Subtract to find the final answer: 217\n**Therefore, x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 217** \n",
