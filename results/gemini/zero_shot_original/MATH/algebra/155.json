    "solution": "$\\emph{Solution 1: Find the first term and common ratio.}$\n\nLet the first term be $a$ and the common ratio be $r.$ Because the second term is $-2,$ we have $ar = -2.$ Because the fifth term is $16,$ we have $ar^4 = 16.$ Dividing this by $ar = -2,$ we have $r^3=-8.$ Therefore, $r=-2.$ So, $a = -2/r = 1.$ Therefore, the fourteenth term is $ar^{13} = (1)(-2)^{13} = \\boxed{-8192}.$\n\n$\\emph{Solution 2: Use our understanding of geometric sequences.}$\n\nTo get from the second term to the fifth term, we multiply by the common ratio, $r,$ three times. Therefore, multiplying $-2$ by $r^3$ gives us $16.$ So, $r^3=-8.$ Rather than finding $r,$ we note that to get to the fourteenth term from the fifth term, we multiply by $r$ nine times, which is the same as multiplying by $r^3$ three times. So, the fourteenth term is $16(-8)^3 = \\boxed{-8192}.$",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understanding Geometric Sequences**\nA geometric sequence is a sequence of numbers where each term is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant factor called the common ratio (often denoted by 'r').\n**2. Setting up the Equations**\nWe're given:\n* The second term (a\u2082) is -2\n* The fifth term (a\u2085) is 16\nWe can express these terms using the general formula for a geometric sequence:\n* a\u2082 = a\u2081 * r\u00b9 = -2\n* a\u2085 = a\u2081 * r\u2074 = 16\n**3. Solving for the Common Ratio (r)**\nDivide the equation for a\u2085 by the equation for a\u2082:\n(a\u2081 * r\u2074) / (a\u2081 * r\u00b9) = 16 / -2\nThis simplifies to r\u00b3 = -8.  Taking the cube root of both sides, we get r = -2.\n**4. Finding the First Term (a\u2081)**\nSubstitute the value of r back into either of the original equations. Let's use a\u2082:\na\u2081 * (-2) = -2\nSolving for a\u2081, we find a\u2081 = 1.\n**5. Finding the Fourteenth Term (a\u2081\u2084)**\nNow that we know a\u2081 and r, we can find a\u2081\u2084 using the general formula:\na\u2081\u2084 = a\u2081 * r\u00b9\u00b3 = 1 * (-2)\u00b9\u00b3 = -8192\n**Answer:** The fourteenth term of the geometric sequence is **-8192**. \n",

Substitute the value of *r* back into the equation for the second term:\n   a(-2) = -2\n   a = 1\n**Calculating the Fourteenth Term**\nThe general formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence is: \na\u2099 = ar\u207f\u207b\u00b9\n1. Substitute the values of *a*, *r*, and *n = 14*:\n   a\u2081\u2084 = 1 * (-2)\u00b9\u2074\u207b\u00b9\n   a\u2081\u2084 = 1 * (-2)\u00b9\u00b3\n2.
