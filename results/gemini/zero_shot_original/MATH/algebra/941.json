        "Here's how to evaluate the expression step-by-step:\n1. **Find the square root:**  \u221a20 is between 4 and 5, since 4\u00b2 = 16 and 5\u00b2 = 25. \n2. **Apply the ceiling function:**  The ceiling function, denoted by  \u2308  \u2309 , gives the smallest integer greater than or equal to the input. Since \u221a20 is between 4 and 5,  \u2308\u221a20\u2309 = 5.\n3. **Square the result:** 5\u00b2 = 25\nTherefore,  \u2308\u221a20\u2309\u00b2 = **25**. \n",
