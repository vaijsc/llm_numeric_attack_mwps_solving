    "solution": "The common ratio between consecutive terms is $\\frac{6}{4} = \\frac{3}{2}$ (we could have chosen any two consecutive terms and divided the second one by the first to find the common ratio; we chose 4 and 6 because they seemed simple). So the $n^\\text{th}$ term of the sequence is $\\frac{16}{9} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{3}{2} \\right)^{n-1}$. Plugging in $n=8$, we get $$\n\\frac{16}{9} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{3}{2} \\right)^{7} = \\frac{2^4}{3^2} \\cdot \\frac{3^7}{2^7}\n= \\frac{3^5}{2^3}\n= \\boxed{\\frac{243}{8}}.\n$$",

        "The common ratio of the geometric sequence is $\\frac{8/3}{16/9} = \\frac{3}{2}$.  Therefore, the eighth term is $6 \\cdot \\left( \\frac{3}{2} \\right)^2 = 6 \\cdot \\frac{9}{4} = \\boxed{\\frac{27}{2}}$. \n",
        "Here's how to find the eighth term of the geometric sequence:\n* **Find the common ratio:** Divide any term by the term before it. For example,  (8/3) / (16/9) = (8/3) * (9/16) = 3/2.  The common ratio is 3/2.\n* **Find the general term:** The general term of a geometric sequence is given by a_n = a_1 * r^(n-1), where a_1 is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the term number.\n* **Apply the formula:** In this case, a_1 = 16/9, r = 3/2, and we want to find the eighth term (n = 8). So, a_8 = (16/9) * (3/2)^(8-1) = (16/9) * (3/2)^7\n* **Simplify:** (16/9) * (3/2)^7 = (16/9) * (2187/128) = **243/8**\nTherefore, the eighth term of the sequence is **243/8**. \n",
