    "solution": "Looking at the form of the equation, we see that we have two linear terms and their product.  We thus apply Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick.  The given equation rearranges to $6mn + 3m +2n +1 = 28$, which can be factored to $(3m + 1)(2n +1) = 28 = 2\\cdot 2\\cdot 7$.  Since $n$ is a positive integer, we see that $2n +1 > 1$ is odd.  Examining the factors on the right side, we see we must have $2n + 1 = 7$, implying $3m+1 = 2\\cdot 2$.  Solving, we find that $(m,n) = \\boxed{(1,3)}$.",

        "Here's how we can solve the problem:\n**1. Rearrange the equation:**\nMove all the terms to one side to get:\n$$6mn + 3m + 2n - 27 = 0$$\n**2.  Factor by grouping:**\n* **Factor out a 3 from the first two terms and a 2 from the last two terms:**\n   $$3m(2n + 1) + 2(n + 1) - 27 = 0$$\n* **Factor out a (2n + 1):**\n   $$(2n + 1)(3m + 2) - 27 = 0$$\n**3. Find possible factors of 27:**\nSince 27 is a positive integer, we need to find pairs of factors of 27 that could potentially represent  (2n + 1) and (3m + 2).\nThe factors of 27 are: 1, 3, 9, and 27.\n**4. Test the factors:**\nWe need to find pairs of factors that, after subtracting 27, result in a product of 0.  Let's try some combinations:\n* **If (2n + 1) = 1 and (3m + 2) = 27:**\n   * This leads to n = 0, which is not a positive integer.\n* **If (2n + 1) = 3 and (3m + 2) = 9:**\n   * This leads to n = 1 and m = 2, which are both positive integers.\n* **If (2n + 1) = 9 and (3m + 2) = 3:**\n   * This leads to n = 4, but m is not an integer.\n* **If (2n + 1) = 27 and (3m + 2) = 1:**\n   * This leads to n = 13, but m is not an integer.\n**5. Solution:**\nThe only combination that works is (2n + 1) = 3 and (3m + 2) = 9, which gives us the solution (m, n) = **(2, 1)**. \n",
        "Here's how we can solve the problem step by step:\n**1. Rearrange the equation:**\nBegin by moving all the terms with variables to one side:\n $$6mn + 3m + 2n = 27$$\n**2.  Complete the Square:**\n* **Focus on the 'm' terms:**  Factor out a 3 from the terms involving 'm':\n  $$3(2mn + m) + 2n = 27$$\n  To complete the square in 'm', we need to add and subtract $(3/2)^2 = 9/4$ inside the parentheses: \n  $$3 \\left( 2mn + m + \\frac{9}{4} - \\frac{9}{4} \\right) + 2n = 27$$\n* **Focus on the 'n' terms:**  Now, factor out a 2 from the terms involving 'n':\n  $$3 \\left( 2mn + m + \\frac{9}{4} \\right) + 2 \\left( n - \\frac{9}{8} \\right) = 27$$\n* **Complete the square in 'n':** We need to add and subtract $(2/2)^2 = 1$ inside the parentheses:\n  $$3 \\left( 2mn + m + \\frac{9}{4} \\right) + 2 \\left( n - \\frac{9}{8} + 1 - 1 \\right) = 27$$\n**3. Express as Squares:**\nNow we can rewrite the equation in a more convenient form:\n$$3 \\left( 2m \\left( n + \\frac{1}{2} \\right) + \\frac{9}{4} \\right) + 2 \\left( n - \\frac{1}{8} \\right) = 27$$\n$$3 \\left( 2m \\left( n + \\frac{1}{2} \\right) + \\left( \\frac{3}{2} \\right)^2 \\right) + 2 \\left( n - \\frac{1}{8} \\right) = 27$$\n$$3 \\left( \\sqrt{2m} \\left( n + \\frac{1}{2} \\right) + \\frac{3}{2} \\right)^2  + 2 \\left( n - \\frac{1}{8} \\right) = 27$$\n**4.  Solve for n:**\n* **Isolate the n terms:**\n  $$2 \\left( n - \\frac{1}{8} \\right) = 27 - 3 \\left( \\sqrt{2m} \\left( n + \\frac{1}{2} \\right) + \\frac{3}{2} \\right)^2$$\n* **Solve for 'n':**\n  $$n - \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{27}{2} - \\frac{3}{2} \\left( \\sqrt{2m} \\left( n + \\frac{1}{2} \\right) + \\frac{3}{2} \\right)^2$$\n  $$n = \\frac{27}{2} - \\frac{3}{2} \\left( \\sqrt{2m} \\left( n + \\frac{1}{2} \\right) + \\frac{3}{2} \\right)^2 + \\frac{1}{8}$$\n**5.  Find Possible Values of m:**\nSince 'n' is a positive integer, the right-hand side of the equation must also be a positive integer. Let's analyze the expression:\n* The term $\\frac{27}{2} + \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{109}{8}$ is a positive fraction.\n* The term $- \\frac{3}{2} \\left( \\sqrt{2m} \\left( n + \\frac{1}{2} \\right) + \\frac{3}{2} \\right)^2$ is always negative or zero. \nFor 'n' to be an integer, the negative term must cancel out a portion of the positive fraction. This means the square of the expression inside the parentheses must be a multiple of 8. \n* Notice that the square of an integer is always a perfect square.  \n* Since 2m is a multiple of 2, the only way to make the square of the expression inside the parentheses a multiple of 8 is if $\\sqrt{2m}$ is an even integer. \nTherefore, 'm' must be a multiple of 8.\n**6.  Test Values of m:**\nLet's start by trying the smallest multiple of 8:\n* If  $m = 8$, we have:\n    $$n = \\frac{109}{8} - \\frac{3}{2} \\left( \\sqrt{16} \\left( n + \\frac{1}{2} \\right) + \\frac{3}{2} \\right)^2$$\n    $$n = \\frac{109}{8} - \\frac{3}{2} \\left( 4n + 5 \\right)^2$$ \n    We can see that no integer value of 'n' will satisfy this equation.\nLet's try the next multiple of 8:\n* If $m = 16$, we have:\n    $$n = \\frac{109}{8} - \\frac{3}{2} \\left( \\sqrt{32} \\left( n + \\frac{1}{2} \\right) + \\frac{3}{2} \\right)^2$$\n    $$n = \\frac{109}{8} - \\frac{3}{2} \\left( 4\\sqrt{2}n + 5\\sqrt{2} + \\frac{3}{2} \\right)^2$$\n    Again, no integer value of 'n' will satisfy this equation.\nWe can continue testing multiples of 8, but it seems likely that there are no solutions where 'm' and 'n' are positive integers. \n**Conclusion:**\nIt appears that there are no solutions to the equation $6mn = 27 - 3m - 2n$ where 'm' and 'n' are positive integers.  The technique of completing the square helps us analyze the equation and identify the constraints on the values of 'm' and 'n'. \n",

Complete the square (sort of):**\nTo make the left-hand side easier to work with, we'll manipulate the equation by adding constants to both sides.  \n* **Focus on the 'm' terms:**  Notice that  $6mn + 3m = 3m(2n + 1)$.  To complete the square, we want a term of the form $(2n + 1)^2$. We can achieve this by adding  $(3/2)^2 = 9/4$ inside the parentheses and subtracting $3(9/4) = 27/4$ on the outside:\n   ```\n   3m(2n + 1) + 2n - 27 = 0\n   3m(2n + 1) + 2n - 27 + 9/4 - 9/4 = 0\n   3m(2n + 1) + 2(n + 1/2) - 105/4 = 0\n   ```\n**3.

Find the factors:**\nSince *m* and *n* are positive integers, we need to find factors of 105/4 that will give us positive integers for (2n + 1) and (3m + 1).\n* The factors of 105 are: 1, 3, 5, 7, 15, 21, 35, and 105.\n* The factors of 4 are: 1, 2, and 4. \nWe need to find combinations of these factors (including their reciprocals) that will result in (2n + 1) and (3m + 1) both being odd integers.  \nThe only combination that works is:\n*  (2n + 1) = 35/2   \n*  (3m + 1) = 3/2\n**5. Solve for m and n:**\n*  From (2n + 1) = 35/2, we get n = 17/4.  This doesn't give us an integer solution.\n*  From (3m + 1) = 3/2, we get m = 1/6.  Again, this doesn't give us an integer solution.\n**Conclusion:**\nThere are **no** ordered pairs (m, n) of positive integers that satisfy the given equation. \n",

Solve for m and n**\n* **Case 1:** 2n + 1 = 1 and 3m + 2 = 27.  This leads to n = 0 and m = 8.33.

Again, we discard this solution because m must be a positive integer.\n* **Case 3:** 2n + 1 = 9 and 3m + 2 = 3.  This leads to n = 4 and m = 1/3.  We discard this solution because m must be a positive integer.\n* **Case 4:** 2n + 1 = 27 and 3m + 2 = 1. This leads to n = 13 and m = -1/3.  We discard this solution because m must be a positive integer.\n**5. The Solution**\nThe only remaining possibility is:\n* **Case 5:** 2n + 1 = 3 and 3m + 2 = 9.  This leads to n = 1 and m = 7/3.

        "Here's how we can solve the equation step by step:\n**1. Rearrange the equation:**\nBegin by moving all the terms to one side to get a standard quadratic-like form:\n$$6mn + 3m + 2n - 27 = 0$$\n**2.  Complete the square:**\nTo make the equation easier to work with, we'll complete the square.  Notice that the left side of the equation almost looks like a product of binomials.  To make it work, we need to add some constants:\n* **Focus on the 'm' terms:**  Factor out a 3 from the terms involving 'm':\n   $$3(2mn + m) + 2n - 27 = 0$$\n* **Complete the square for 'm':** Inside the parentheses, we want to add and subtract $(1/2)^2 = 1/4$ to complete the square for the 'm' terms.  This becomes:\n   $$3(2mn + m + 1/4 - 1/4) + 2n - 27 = 0$$ \n* **Focus on the 'n' terms:**  Factor out a 2 from the terms involving 'n':\n   $$3(2mn + m + 1/4) + 2(n - 13.5) = 0$$\n* **Complete the square for 'n':**  We need to add and subtract $(1/2)^2 = 1/4$ inside the second set of parentheses to complete the square for 'n':\n   $$3(2mn + m + 1/4) + 2(n - 13.5 + 1/4 - 1/4) = 0$$\n**3. Factor and simplify:**\nNow we can factor the expressions in the parentheses:\n$$3(2m + 1)(n + 1/4) + 2(n - 13.5 - 1/4) = 0$$\nSimplify:\n$$3(2m + 1)(n + 1/4) + 2(n - 27/2) = 0$$\n**4.  Solve for one variable:**\nWe can now solve for one of the variables.  Let's solve for 'n':\n*  Move the 'n' terms to one side:\n   $$2(n - 27/2) = -3(2m + 1)(n + 1/4)$$\n*  Simplify:\n   $$n - 27/2 = -\\frac{3}{2}(2m + 1)(n + 1/4)$$\n*  Expand:\n   $$n - 27/2 = -\\frac{3}{2}(2mn + m + \\frac{1}{4}n + \\frac{1}{8})$$\n*  Combine 'n' terms:\n   $$n + \\frac{3}{2}(2mn + \\frac{1}{4}n) = -\\frac{3}{2}(m + \\frac{1}{8}) + \\frac{27}{2}$$\n*  Factor out 'n':\n   $$n(1 + \\frac{3}{2}(2m + \\frac{1}{4})) = -\\frac{3}{2}(m + \\frac{1}{8}) + \\frac{27}{2}$$\n*  Isolate 'n':\n   $$n = \\frac{-\\frac{3}{2}(m + \\frac{1}{8}) + \\frac{27}{2}}{1 + \\frac{3}{2}(2m + \\frac{1}{4})}$$\n*  Simplify:\n   $$n = \\frac{-3m - 3/16 + 27}{2 + 6m + 3/4}$$\n   $$n = \\frac{-12m + 432}{8 + 24m + 3}$$\n   $$n = \\frac{-12m + 432}{24m + 11}$$\n**5. Consider Integer Solutions:**\nSince we want 'n' to be a positive integer, we need the numerator to be divisible by the denominator.  Notice that the numerator and denominator have a common factor of 12:\n$$n = \\frac{-12m + 432}{24m + 11} = \\frac{-12(m - 36)}{12(2m + 11/12)}$$\n$$n = \\frac{-m + 36}{2m + 11/12}$$\nFor 'n' to be an integer,  the denominator must divide into the numerator. Since we are dealing with positive integers, this means that $(2m + 11/12)$ must be a factor of $(36 - m)$.\n**6. Finding Solutions:**\nWe need to find values of 'm' that satisfy the condition above.  It's helpful to start by considering the possible values of $(2m + 11/12)$.  For example, if $(2m + 11/12) = 1$, then $m = 1/24$. This is not an integer, so we move on.  We can continue trying different values of $(2m + 11/12)$.\n* If $(2m + 11/12) = 2$, then $m = 13/24$ (not an integer).\n* If $(2m + 11/12) = 3$, then $m = 17/24$ (not an integer).\n* If $(2m + 11/12) = 4$, then $m = 25/24$ (not an integer).\n* If $(2m + 11/12) = 5$, then $m = 49/24$ (not an integer).\n* If $(2m + 11/12) = 6$, then $m = 55/24$ (not an integer).\nWe can continue testing values.  Eventually, we find:\n* If $(2m + 11/12) = 7$, then $m = 73/24$ (not an integer).\n* If $(2m + 11/12) = 8$, then $m = 91/24$ (not an integer).\n* If $(2m + 11/12) = 9$, then $m = 109/24$ (not an integer).\n* If $(2m + 11/12) = 10$, then $m = 127/24$ (not an integer).\n* If $(2m + 11/12) = 11$, then $m = 145/24$ (not an integer).\n* If $(2m + 11/12) = 12$, then $m = 163/24$ (not an integer).\n* If $(2m + 11/12) = 13$, then $m = 181/24$ (not an integer).\n* **If $(2m + 11/12) = 14$, then $m = 77/12$ (not an integer).**  **This is important because we start seeing repeated values.** \n**Notice:**  We are now getting repeated values for $(2m + 11/12)$. Since the denominator is increasing, and we are trying to find factors of $(36 - m)$, it is likely that we will keep getting values that don't work.\n**7.  Conclusion:**\nThe analysis above indicates that there are no positive integer solutions for $(m,n)$ that satisfy the given equation.  The process of completing the square and trying to find integer solutions showed us that the denominator of the expression for 'n' never becomes a factor of the numerator. \n"
