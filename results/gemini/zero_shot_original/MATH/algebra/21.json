        "Here's how we can solve this step-by-step:\n* **Current Offer:** Mike is offered double the original price, so he's currently being offered $1.25 * 2 = $2.50.\n* **Years in the Future:** We want to know the price in 12 more years. Since the price doubles every three years, this is 12 / 3 = 4 periods of doubling.\n* **Calculating the Price:** The price will double four times:\n    * Year 3: $2.50\n    * Year 6: $2.50 * 2 = $5.00\n    * Year 9: $5.00 * 2 = $10.00\n    * Year 12: $10.00 * 2 = $20.00\n    * Year 15: $20.00 * 2 = $40.00\n**Therefore, Mike will be offered $40.00 for the stamp in 12 more years.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n* **Calculate the current offer price:** Mike was offered double the original price, so the current offer is $1.25 * 2 = $2.50.\n* **Determine the number of 3-year intervals:** 12 more years divided by 3 years per interval equals 4 intervals.\n* **Calculate the offer price after 12 years:** Since the price doubles every 3 years, we need to double the current offer price 4 times: \n    * After 3 years: $2.50 * 2 = $5.00\n    * After 6 years: $5.00 * 2 = $10.00\n    * After 9 years: $10.00 * 2 = $20.00\n    * After 12 years: $20.00 * 2 = $40.00\n**Therefore, Mike will be offered $40.00 for the stamp in 12 more years.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n* **Calculate the offer price after 3 years:** Since the offer price doubles every three years, after three years, the stamp will be worth $1.25 * 2 = $2.50.\n* **Calculate the offer price after 6 years:** After another three years (total of 6 years), the stamp will be worth $2.50 * 2 = $5.00.\n* **Calculate the offer price after 9 years:**  After another three years (total of 9 years), the stamp will be worth $5.00 * 2 = $10.00.\n* **Calculate the offer price after 12 years:** After another three years (total of 12 years), the stamp will be worth $10.00 * 2 = $20.00.\n**Therefore, Mike will be offered $20.00 for the stamp in 12 more years.** \n",

We can represent this as 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 2^4 = 16\n* **Calculate the final offer price:**  The current offer price of $2.50 will be multiplied by 16 in 12 years.
