    "solution": "Let $a$ be the number of coins Amy has, $b$ the number Ben has, $c$ the number Carl has, and $d$ the number Debbie has. We can use the information in the problem to create the following system of linear equations:  \\begin{align*}\n3a &= b \\\\\n3b &= c \\\\\n\\frac{2}{3}c &= d \\\\\na \\cdot b \\cdot c \\cdot d &= 162\n\\end{align*} We know that $b = 3a$. Also, $c = 3b$, so $c$ must equal $9a$. Then, $d = \\frac{2}{3}c$, so $d = 6a$. Substituting these quantities into our product gives $a \\cdot 3a \\cdot 9a \\cdot 6a = 162,$ which simplifies to $162a^4 = 162,$ or $a^4 = 1,$ so $a = 1$. Given this value, we can find that $b = 3$, $c = 9$, and $d = 6$. Thus, the four children have $1 + 3 + 9 + 6 = \\boxed{19}$ coins all together.",

        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Set up variables:**\n* Let  'A' represent the number of coins Amy has.\n* Let 'B' represent the number of coins Ben has.\n* Let 'C' represent the number of coins Carl has.\n* Let 'D' represent the number of coins Debbie has.\n**2. Translate the given information into equations:**\n* \"Ben has three times the number of coins that Amy has\":  B = 3A\n* \"Ben has a third of the number of coins that Carl has\": B = C/3 \n* \"Debbie has two-thirds the number of coins that Carl has\": D = (2/3)C\n* \"The number of coins that Amy has, multiplied by the number of coins that Ben has, multiplied by the number of coins that Carl has, multiplied by the number of coins that Debbie has, is $162$\": A * B * C * D = 162\n**3. Solve for one variable in terms of another:**\n* Since we know B = 3A, we can substitute '3A' for 'B' in the equation A * B * C * D = 162:\n   A * (3A) * C * D = 162\n**4. Substitute again:**\n* We know B = C/3, so C = 3B.  Substitute '3B' for 'C':\n   A * (3A) * (3B) * D = 162\n* We also know D = (2/3)C. Substitute '(2/3)C' for 'D':\n   A * (3A) * (3B) * (2/3)C = 162\n**5. Simplify the equation:**\n* 6A\u00b2BC = 162\n**6.  Substitute 'B' with '3A' again:**\n* 6A\u00b2 * (3A) * C = 162\n* 18A\u00b3C = 162\n**7. Solve for C in terms of A:**\n* C = 162 / (18A\u00b3) = 9/A\u00b3\n**8. Find possible values for A:**\n* We need to find a whole number value for 'A' that makes 'C' a whole number.  The only possible value for 'A' is 1.  This is because the cube root of 9 is not a whole number, but the cube root of 1 is 1. \n**9. Calculate the number of coins each person has:**\n* Amy (A) has 1 coin.\n* Ben (B) has 3A = 3 * 1 = 3 coins.\n* Carl (C) has 9/A\u00b3 = 9/1\u00b3 = 9 coins.\n* Debbie (D) has (2/3)C = (2/3) * 9 = 6 coins.\n**10. Find the total number of coins:**\n* Total coins = A + B + C + D = 1 + 3 + 9 + 6 = **19 coins**\n**Therefore, the four children have a total of 19 coins.** \n",
