    "solution": "We want $\\pi R^{2}-\\pi r^{2}\\leq 5\\pi$. Dividing by $\\pi$, we have $R^{2}-r^{2}\\leq 5$. Factor the left-hand side to get $(R+r)(R-r)\\leq 5$. Substituting 10 for $R+r$ gives $10(R-r)\\leq 5 \\implies R-r \\leq 1/2$. So the maximum difference in the lengths of the radii is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.",
