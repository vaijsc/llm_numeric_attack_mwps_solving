        "Here's how to compute $115^2$ in your head:\n**1. Recognize the pattern:**\n* 115 is close to 100.  We can use this to our advantage.\n**2.  Break down the problem:**\n* Think of 115 as (100 + 15). \n* Squaring this: (100 + 15)\u00b2 = 100\u00b2 + 2(100)(15) + 15\u00b2\n**3. Calculate each part:**\n* 100\u00b2 = 10,000\n* 2(100)(15) = 3,000\n* 15\u00b2 = 225 \n**4. Add the parts together:**\n* 10,000 + 3,000 + 225 = 13,225\n**Therefore, 115\u00b2 = 13,225** \n",
        "Here's how to compute 115\u00b2 in your head:\n**1. Recognize the pattern:** 115 is close to 100, which makes mental calculation easier.\n**2. Break it down:**\n   *  Think of 115 as (100 + 15)\n**3. Expand using the distributive property (or FOIL):**\n   * (100 + 15)\u00b2 = (100 + 15)(100 + 15)\n   * = 100 * 100 + 100 * 15 + 15 * 100 + 15 * 15\n**4.
