    "solution": "If $x+4\\geq 0$ (or $x\\geq -4$), then the given inequality is the same as $x+4<9$ which means $x<5$. If $x+4<0$ (or $x<-4$), we have $-(x+4)<9$ which means $x+4>-9$ which yields $x>-13$. Thus, the solution is $-13<x<5$. Thus, the integers in this solution are -1 through -12 (12 integers), 1 through 4 (4 integers), and 0 (1 integer). Thus, the total is $12+4+1=\\boxed{17}$ integers.",

        "Here's how to solve the inequality and find the number of integers in the solution:\n**1. Understand Absolute Value**\nThe absolute value of a number is its distance from zero.  So,  |x + 4| < 9 means the distance between *x + 4* and zero is less than 9.\n**2. Split the Inequality**\nBecause of the absolute value, we need to consider two cases:\n* **Case 1:**  x + 4 < 9\n* **Case 2:** -(x + 4) < 9\n**3. Solve Each Case**\n* **Case 1:**\n   * x + 4 < 9\n   * x < 5\n* **Case 2:**\n   * -(x + 4) < 9\n   * -x - 4 < 9\n   * -x < 13\n   * x > -13 \n**4. Combine the Solutions**\nThe solution to the inequality is the intersection of the solutions from both cases:\n* x > -13  AND  x < 5\n**5.

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand Absolute Value**\nThe absolute value of a number is its distance from zero.  So,  |x| = 5 means x is 5 units away from zero, which could be either 5 or -5.\n**2. Split the Inequality**\nSince we have an absolute value, we need to split the inequality into two cases:\n* **Case 1:**  x + 4 < 9 \n* **Case 2:** -(x + 4) < 9 \n**3. Solve Each Case**\n* **Case 1:**\n   * Subtract 4 from both sides: x < 5\n* **Case 2:**\n   * Distribute the negative sign: -x - 4 < 9\n   * Add 4 to both sides: -x < 13\n   * Multiply both sides by -1 (and remember to flip the inequality sign): x > -13\n**4. Combine the Solutions**\nThe solutions to the inequality are all numbers greater than -13 and less than 5.  We can write this as:\n-13 < x < 5\n**5. Count the Integers**\nThe integers in this range are: -12, -11, -10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.\n**Answer:** There are **17** integers in the solution of the inequality. \n",

This can be broken down into two cases:\n* **Case 1:** x + 4 is positive.  In this case, we have:\n   x + 4 < 9\n   x < 5\n* **Case 2:** x + 4 is negative.

This can be rewritten as two separate inequalities:\n* **x + 4 < 9** \n* **x + 4 > -9**\n**3.
