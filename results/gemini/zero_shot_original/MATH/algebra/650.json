        "1. **Substitute 2x for x in the function:**  Since we're looking for *f(2x)*, we replace every *x* in the original function with *2x*. This gives us:\n   *f(2x) = (2x)^2 - 3(2x) + 4*\n2. **Simplify the expression:** Now, we just need to simplify the expression:\n   *f(2x) = 4x^2 - 6x + 4*\n**Therefore, the expression that describes f(2x) is 4x^2 - 6x + 4.** \n",
