        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n* **Understanding the exponent:**  The exponent 1/4 represents taking the fourth root.  This is the same as finding a number that, when multiplied by itself four times, equals the original number.\n* **Simplifying the base:**  The fraction 16/625 can be expressed as (2/5) raised to the power of 4: \n   * 16 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 2\u2074\n   * 625 = 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 = 5\u2074\n   * Therefore, 16/625 = (2\u2074)/(5\u2074) = (2/5)\u2074\n* **Applying the exponent:** Now we have:  ((2/5)\u2074)^(1/4)\n    * When raising a power to another power, we multiply the exponents:  (2/5)\u2074 * (1/4) = (2/5)\u00b9\n* **Result:** (2/5)\u00b9 = **2/5** \nTherefore,  (16/625)^(1/4) = **2/5** \n",
        "**1. Understand the exponent:**  The exponent 1/4 represents taking the fourth root.\n**2. Find the fourth roots:** \n* The fourth root of 16 is 2 (since 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 16).\n* The fourth root of 625 is 5 (since 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 = 625).\n**3. Combine the roots:**\n* Therefore, $\\left(\\frac{16}{625}\\right)^{\\frac14} = \\frac{2}{5}$.\n**Answer:**  $\\left(\\frac{16}{625}\\right)^{\\frac14} = \\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}}$ \n",
        "**1. Simplify the base:**\n*  The base of the expression is $\\frac{16}{625}$.  Both 16 and 625 are perfect fourth powers:\n    * $16 = 2^4$\n    * $625 = 5^4$\n* So, we can rewrite the base as:  $\\frac{16}{625} = \\frac{2^4}{5^4}$\n**2. Apply the exponent:**\n* Now we have:  $\\left(\\frac{2^4}{5^4}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{4}}$\n* Using the rule of exponents that says $(a^m)^n = a^{m \\cdot n}$, we get:  $\\frac{2^{4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{4}}}{5^{4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{4}}}$\n* This simplifies to:  $\\frac{2^1}{5^1}$\n**3.
