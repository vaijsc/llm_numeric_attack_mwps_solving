    "problem": "A tennis player computes her win ratio by dividing the number of matches she has won by the total number of matches she has played. At the start of a weekend, her win ratio is exactly $.500$. During the weekend, she plays four matches, winning three and losing one. At the end of the weekend, her win ratio is greater than $.503$.

    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let $n$ be the number of matches she won before the weekend began. Since her win ratio started at exactly .$500 = \\tfrac{1}{2},$ she must have played exactly $2n$ games total before the weekend began. After the weekend, she would have won $n+3$ games out of $2n+4$ total. Therefore, her win ratio would be $(n+3)/(2n+4).$ This means that \\[\\frac{n+3}{2n+4} > .503 = \\frac{503}{1000}.\\]Cross-multiplying, we get $1000(n+3) > 503(2n+4),$ which is equivalent to $n < \\frac{988}{6} = 164.\\overline{6}.$ Since $n$ must be an integer, the largest possible value for $n$ is $\\boxed{164}.$",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Ratios:**\n* **Before the weekend:** Her win ratio is 0.500, meaning she won half her matches.  \n* **After the weekend:** Her win ratio is greater than 0.503, meaning she won slightly more than half her matches.\n**2. Analyze the Weekend's Impact:**\n* She won 3 out of 4 matches, increasing her win ratio.  This means her win ratio was initially *slightly* lower than 0.500 before the weekend. \n**3. Set Up an Inequality:**\n* Let 'x' be the number of matches she won before the weekend.\n* Let 'y' be the total number of matches she played before the weekend.\n* Her win ratio before the weekend is x/y = 0.500.\n* Her win ratio after the weekend is (x + 3) / (y + 4) > 0.503.\n**4. Simplify and Solve:**\n* From x/y = 0.500, we know x = 0.5y. \n* Substitute this into the second inequality: (0.5y + 3) / (y + 4) > 0.503.\n* Multiply both sides by (y + 4): 0.5y + 3 > 0.503(y + 4).\n* Simplify: 0.5y + 3 > 0.503y + 2.012.\n* Subtract 0.5y and 2.012 from both sides: 0.988 > 0.003y.\n* Divide both sides by 0.003: y < 329.33.\n**5. Determine the Largest Possible 'x':**\n* Since y must be a whole number, the largest possible value for y is 329.\n* Substitute y = 329 into x = 0.5y to find x: x = 0.5 * 329 = 164.5.\n* Since x must be a whole number, the largest possible value for x is 164.\n**Answer:** The largest number of matches she could have won before the weekend began is **164**. \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Win Ratio:**\n* A win ratio of 0.500 means she has won half the matches she's played. \n**2. Analyze the Weekend Matches:**\n* She played 4 matches and won 3. \n* This means she increased her wins by 3 and her total matches by 4.\n**3.  Set Up an Inequality:**\n* Let 'x' be the number of matches she won before the weekend.\n* Let 'y' be the total number of matches she played before the weekend.\n* Her win ratio after the weekend is (x + 3) / (y + 4) \n* We know this ratio is greater than 0.503:  (x + 3) / (y + 4) > 0.503\n**4. Simplify the Inequality:**\n* Multiply both sides by (y + 4): x + 3 > 0.503(y + 4)\n* Distribute: x + 3 > 0.503y + 2.012\n* Subtract 3 and 0.503y from both sides: x - 0.503y > -0.988\n**5. Consider the Initial Win Ratio:**\n* We know x/y = 0.500  or x = 0.5y \n* Substitute this into the inequality: 0.5y - 0.503y > -0.988\n**6. Solve for 'y':**\n* Combine like terms: -0.003y > -0.988\n* Divide both sides by -0.003 (and flip the inequality sign since we're dividing by a negative number): y < 329.33\n**7. Determine the Maximum Value of 'x':**\n* Since 'y' must be an integer, the largest possible value for 'y' is 329.\n* Using the equation x = 0.5y, the largest possible value for 'x' is 0.5 * 329 = **164.5**\n**8. Final Answer:**\n* Since 'x' represents the number of matches won, and it must be an integer, the largest number of matches she could've won before the weekend is **164**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Win Ratio**\n* A win ratio of .500 means she won half her matches before the weekend.\n**2. Calculate Matches Played Before the Weekend**\n* Let 'x' be the number of matches she played before the weekend.\n* Since her win ratio was .500, she won 'x/2' matches.\n**3. Calculate Total Matches and Wins After the Weekend**\n* She played 4 more matches, so her total is now x + 4.\n* She won 3 more matches, so her total wins are (x/2) + 3.\n**4. Set Up the Inequality**\n* Her new win ratio is greater than .503:\n   [(x/2) + 3] / (x + 4) > 0.503\n**5. Solve the Inequality**\n* Multiply both sides by (x + 4): (x/2) + 3 > 0.503(x + 4)\n* Simplify: 0.5x + 3 > 0.503x + 2.012\n* Subtract 0.5x and 2.012 from both sides: 0.988 > 0.003x\n* Divide both sides by 0.003: x < 329.33\n**6. Determine the Largest Possible Value for x**\n* Since 'x' represents the number of matches played, it must be a whole number.\n* The largest whole number less than 329.33 is 329.\n**Answer**\nThe largest number of matches she could have won before the weekend began is **329**. \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understanding the Win Ratio**\n* A win ratio of .500 means she won half of the matches she played before the weekend.\n**2. Weekend Matches**\n* She played 4 matches and won 3, increasing her wins by 3 and her total matches by 4.\n**3. New Win Ratio**\n* Her new win ratio is greater than .503, meaning her wins now represent more than 50.3% of her total matches played.\n**4. Setting up an Inequality**\n* Let 'x' be the number of matches she won before the weekend. \n* Her total wins after the weekend are (x + 3).\n* Her total matches after the weekend are (x + 4).\n* The inequality representing her new win ratio is:  (x + 3) / (x + 4) > 0.503\n**5. Solving the Inequality**\n* Multiply both sides by (x + 4): x + 3 > 0.503(x + 4)\n* Distribute: x + 3 > 0.503x + 2.012\n* Subtract 0.503x from both sides: 0.497x + 3 > 2.012\n* Subtract 3 from both sides: 0.497x > -0.988\n* Divide both sides by 0.497: x > -1.988\n**6. Finding the Largest Possible Integer Value**\n* Since she can't have won a negative number of matches, the smallest possible integer value for x is 0.\n* However, we need her win ratio to be greater than .503. Let's try a few values of x greater than 0:\n    * If x = 1, her win ratio is 4/5 = 0.8, which is greater than .503\n    * If x = 2, her win ratio is 5/6 = 0.833, which is also greater than .503\n**7. The Answer**\n* The largest possible number of matches she could have won before the weekend is **2**. \n",
