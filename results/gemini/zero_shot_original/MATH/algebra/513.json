    "solution": "The graph of $y = 4(x + 7)(2 - x)$ is a parabola.  Since $y = 0$ when $x = -7$ and $x = 2$, the $x$-intercepts of the parabola are $(-7,0)$ and $(2,0)$.  If the vertex of the parabola is $(h,k)$, then the $x$-intercepts $(-7,0)$ and $(2,0)$ are symmetric around the line $x = h$, so $h = (-7 + 2)/2 = -5/2$.\n\nHence, the maximum value of $y = 4(x + 7)(2 - x)$ occurs at $x = -5/2$, in which case \\[y = 4 \\left( -\\frac{5}{2} + 7 \\right) \\left( 2 + \\frac{5}{2} \\right) = 4 \\cdot \\frac{9}{2} \\cdot \\frac{9}{2} = \\boxed{81}.\\] (Note that this is a maximum value, and not a minimum value, because the coefficient of $x^2$ in $y = 4(x + 7)(2 - x) = -4x^2 - 20x + 56$ is negative.)",

        "Here's how to find the maximum value step-by-step:\n**1. Expand the Expression**\nFirst, expand the expression:\n```\n4(x + 7)(2 - x) = 4(2x - x^2 + 14 - 7x) = 4(-x^2 - 5x + 14) \n```\n**2. Recognize the Quadratic Form**\nThe expression is now in the form of a quadratic equation:\n```\n-4x^2 - 20x + 56 \n```\n**3. Find the Vertex**\nThe maximum value of a quadratic equation occurs at its vertex.  We can find the x-coordinate of the vertex using the formula:\n```\nx = -b / 2a \n```\nwhere *a* and *b* are the coefficients of the quadratic equation (in the form *ax\u00b2 + bx + c*).  In our case, *a* = -4 and *b* = -20.  \nSubstituting:\n```\nx = -(-20) / (2 * -4) = 20 / -8 = -5/2\n```\n**4. Calculate the Maximum Value**\nNow that we know the x-coordinate of the vertex, we can substitute it back into the original expression to find the maximum value:\n```\n4(-5/2 + 7)(2 - (-5/2)) = 4(9/2)(9/2) = 81 \n```\n**Therefore, the maximum value of  4(x + 7)(2 - x) is 81.** \n",
        "Here's how to find the maximum value step-by-step:\n**1. Expand the Expression**\nBegin by expanding the expression:\n```\n4(x + 7)(2 - x) = 4(2x - x\u00b2 + 14 - 7x) \n                 = -4x\u00b2 - 20x + 56 \n```\n**2. Recognize the Form**\nThe expanded expression is a quadratic function in the form  *ax\u00b2 + bx + c*, where *a* = -4, *b* = -20, and *c* = 56.  Since the coefficient of the *x\u00b2* term is negative (*a* < 0), the graph of this quadratic is a parabola opening downwards. This means it has a maximum value.\n**3. Find the Vertex**\nThe maximum value occurs at the vertex of the parabola.  We can find the x-coordinate of the vertex using the formula:\n* x = -b / 2a \nSubstitute the values of *a* and *b*:\n* x = -(-20) / (2 * -4) \n* x = 20 / -8\n* x = -5/2\n**4. Calculate the Maximum Value**\nNow that we know the x-coordinate of the vertex, substitute it back into the original expression to find the maximum value:\n* 4(-5/2 + 7)(2 - (-5/2)) = 4(9/2)(9/2) = 81\n**Therefore, the maximum value of 4(x + 7)(2 - x) is 81.** \n",

Recognize the Form:**\nThe expression is now a quadratic function in the form of  -4x\u00b2 - 20x + 56.
