Setting this equal to $5$, we find \\begin{align*}\n9+(n-1)^2 &= 25 \\implies \\\\\n(n-1)^2 &= 16 \\implies \\\\\nn-1 = 4 \\quad&\\text{or}\\quad n-1=-4 \\implies \\\\\nn = 5 \\quad&\\text{or}\\quad n=-3.\n\\end{align*} Both of these solutions are integers, and their product is $\\boxed{-15}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Use the Distance Formula**\nThe distance formula tells us the distance between two points:\n  \u221a[(x\u2082 - x\u2081)\u00b2 + (y\u2082 - y\u2081)\u00b2]\nWe know the distance is 5, and the two points are (2, n) and (-1, 1).  Let's plug those values into the formula:\n  5 = \u221a[(2 - (-1))\u00b2 + (n - 1)\u00b2]\n**2. Simplify the Equation**\nSimplify the expression inside the square root:\n  5 = \u221a[3\u00b2 + (n - 1)\u00b2]\n  5 = \u221a[9 + (n - 1)\u00b2]\n**3. Square Both Sides**\nSquare both sides of the equation to get rid of the square root:\n  25 = 9 + (n - 1)\u00b2\n**4. Isolate the (n - 1)\u00b2 term**\nSubtract 9 from both sides:\n  16 = (n - 1)\u00b2\n**5. Take the Square Root of Both Sides**\nTake the square root of both sides, remembering to consider both positive and negative roots:\n  \u00b14 = n - 1\n**6. Solve for n**\nAdd 1 to both sides to find the possible values of n:\n*  n = 4 + 1 = 5\n*  n = -4 + 1 = -3\n**7. Find the Product**\nThe product of the possible integer values of n is 5 * (-3) = **-15**. \n",
