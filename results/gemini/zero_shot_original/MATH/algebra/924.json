        "Here's how to find the minimum value of the function:\n**1. Recognize the Form**\nThe equation  *y = x\u00b2 - 6x + 13* is a quadratic equation.  Quadratic equations in standard form (y = ax\u00b2 + bx + c) graph as parabolas. \n**2.  Finding the Vertex**\n* **Vertex Formula:** The x-coordinate of the vertex of a parabola is given by:  x = -b / 2a \n    * In our equation, a = 1 and b = -6.\n    *  x = -(-6) / (2 * 1) = 3\n* **Substitute to find y:** Now that we know the x-coordinate of the vertex is 3, we can substitute it back into the original equation to find the y-coordinate:\n    * y = (3)\u00b2 - 6(3) + 13 = 9 - 18 + 13 = 4\n**3.  Minimum Value**\nThe vertex of a parabola represents either the minimum or maximum point. Since the coefficient of the x\u00b2 term (a = 1) is positive, the parabola opens upwards, meaning the vertex is the minimum point.\n**Answer:** The minimum possible value for *y* in the equation *y = x\u00b2 - 6x + 13* is **4**. \n",
        "Here's how to find the minimum value of the function:\n**1. Recognize the Form**\nThe equation  *y = x\u00b2 - 6x + 13* is a quadratic equation. Its graph is a parabola.  \n**2. Completing the Square**\n* **Factor out a -1 from the first two terms:** \n   y = (x\u00b2 - 6x) + 13 \n* **Take half of the coefficient of the x term (-6), square it ( (-6/2)\u00b2 = 9), and add and subtract it inside the parentheses:**\n   y = (x\u00b2 - 6x + 9 - 9) + 13\n* **Rewrite the expression inside the parentheses as a squared term:**\n   y = (x - 3)\u00b2 - 9 + 13\n* **Simplify:**\n   y = (x - 3)\u00b2 + 4\n**3.  Interpretation**\nThe equation is now in vertex form: *y = (x - h)\u00b2 + k*, where (h, k) is the vertex of the parabola. In this case, the vertex is (3, 4).\n**4. Minimum Value**\nSince the coefficient of the (x - 3)\u00b2 term is positive, the parabola opens upwards. This means the vertex represents the minimum point of the function.\n**Therefore, the minimum possible value for y is 4.** \n",
