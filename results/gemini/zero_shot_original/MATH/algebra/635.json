    "solution": "Since $f$ has a degree of $2$, the degree of $(f(x))^3$ is $6$. Also, since $g$ has a degree of $3$, the degree of $(g(x))^2$ is $6$. Furthermore, as $f$ and $g$ both have a leading coefficient of $1$, then $(f(x))^3$ and $(g(x))^2$ both have a leading coefficient of $1$. Hence, when subtracting $(f(x))^3 - (g(x))^2$, the leading terms cancel, and so $(f(x))^3 - (g(x))^2$ has a maximum degree of $5$. We can see that a degree of $\\boxed{5}$ can be achieved by taking $f(x) = x^2 + x$ and $g(x) = x^3$, for example.",

Understand the Degree of Each Term:**\n* **(f(x))^3:** Since *f(x)* is a quadratic (degree 2), cubing it gives us a polynomial of degree 6 (2 * 3 = 6).\n* **(g(x))^2:** Since *g(x)* is a cubic (degree 3), squaring it gives us a polynomial of degree 6 (3 * 2 = 6).\n* **f(x):** This remains a quadratic (degree 2).\n* **-1:** This is a constant term, essentially a polynomial of degree 0.\n**2.
