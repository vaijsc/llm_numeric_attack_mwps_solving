        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Elimination Method**\n* **Goal:** Eliminate one variable to create a system of two equations with two variables.\n* **Step 1:** Notice that the coefficients of 'y' are the same in both equations.  Subtract the first equation from the second equation:\n   ```\n   (4x + 5y + 12z) - (6x + 5y - 2z) = 54 - (-4)\n   ```\n* **Step 2:** Simplify the equation:\n   ```\n   -2x + 14z = 58 \n   ```\n**2. Solve for One Variable**\n* **Step 1:**  Solve the simplified equation for 'x':\n   ```\n   -2x = -14z + 58\n   x = 7z - 29 \n   ```\n**3. Substitute and Solve**\n* **Step 1:** Substitute the value of 'x' we just found into either of the original equations. Let's use the first equation:\n   ```\n   6(7z - 29) + 5y - 2z = -4\n   ```\n* **Step 2:** Simplify and solve for 'y':\n   ```\n   42z - 174 + 5y - 2z = -4\n   40z + 5y = 170\n   5y = -40z + 170\n   y = -8z + 34\n   ```\n**4. Find the Sum**\n* **Step 1:** We now have expressions for 'x' and 'y' in terms of 'z'.  Substitute these into the expression we want to find:\n   ```\n   x + y + z = (7z - 29) + (-8z + 34) + z\n   ```\n* **Step 2:** Simplify:\n   ```\n   x + y + z = 5 \n   ```\n**Therefore, the value of x + y + z is 5.** \n",
