    "solution": "Subtracting $2x$ from both sides, it follows that $x^2 - 2x - 15 < 0$. This factors as $x^2 - 2x - 15 = (x-5)(x+3) < 0$, from which it follows (by testing values or inspection) that $-3 < x < 5$. Then $a = -2, b = 4$, and $b-a$ is $4 - (-2) = \\boxed{6}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Rearrange the inequality:**\n   Subtract  2x from both sides to get a standard quadratic inequality:\n   x\u00b2 - 2x - 15 < 0\n**2. Factor the quadratic:**\n   The quadratic factors as (x - 5)(x + 3) < 0\n**3. Find the critical points:**\n   The critical points are the values of x that make the expression equal to zero.  So, x = 5 and x = -3.\n**4.  Determine the sign of the expression:**\n   We can use a sign chart to determine the sign of the expression (x - 5)(x + 3) for different values of x:\n   | Interval      | x - 5 | x + 3 | (x - 5)(x + 3) |\n   |---------------|-------|-------|----------------|\n   | x < -3       | -     | -     | +                |\n   | -3 < x < 5   | -     | +     | -                |\n   | x > 5        | +     | +     | +                |\n   Since we want (x - 5)(x + 3) < 0, the solution is -3 < x < 5.\n**5. Find the smallest and largest integers:**\n   The smallest integer within this interval is **a = -2**.\n   The largest integer within this interval is **b = 4**.\n**6. Calculate b - a:**\n   b - a = 4 - (-2) = **6** \n**Therefore, b - a = 6** \n",
