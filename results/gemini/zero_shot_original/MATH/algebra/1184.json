        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Concept:**\n* **Collinearity:** If three points lie on the same line, they are called collinear.\n* **Slope:** The slope of a line is constant throughout.  This means the slope calculated between any two points on the line will be the same.\n**2. Calculate the Slopes:**\n* **Slope between A and C:** \n   *  Slope (m) = (change in y) / (change in x) = (0 - 1) / (7 - 9) = -1 / -2 = 1/2\n* **Slope between B and C:**\n   * Slope (m) = (k - 0) / (19 - 7) = k / 12\n**3. Set the Slopes Equal:**\nSince points A, B, and C are collinear, the slopes calculated above must be equal:\n1/2 = k/12\n**4. Solve for k:**\n* Multiply both sides by 12: 12 * (1/2) = k\n* Simplify: 6 = k\n**Therefore, the value of k is 6.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**Understanding the Problem**\nWe're given three points on a line.  The goal is to find the value of *k* which makes all three points lie on the same line. \n**Strategy**\nWe can use the concept of slope.  If three points lie on the same line, the slope between any two pairs of points must be equal.\n**Calculations**\n1. **Find the slope between points A and C:**\n   The slope formula is:  (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n   Slope (AC) = (0 - 1) / (7 - 9) = -1 / -2 = 1/2\n2. **Find the slope between points B and C:**\n   Slope (BC) = (k - 0) / (19 - 7) = k / 12\n3. **Set the slopes equal to each other:**\n   Since all three points lie on the same line, the slopes must be equal:\n   1/2 = k / 12\n4. **Solve for k:**\n   Multiply both sides by 12:  6 = k\n**Answer**\nTherefore, the value of *k* is **6**. \n",
