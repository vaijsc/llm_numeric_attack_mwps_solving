        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Expand the factored expression:**\n   (Ax - 8)(Bx + 3) = ABx\u00b2 + (3A - 8B)x - 24\n**2. Match coefficients:**\n   We want this expression to equal 10x\u00b2 - x - 24.  This means:\n   * AB = 10 \n   * 3A - 8B = -1\n**3. Solve the system of equations:**\n   * **From AB = 10:** The possible pairs of integers for (A, B) are (1, 10), (2, 5), (5, 2), and (10, 1).\n   * **Test each pair in 3A - 8B = -1:**\n      * (1, 10): 3 - 80 = -77 (doesn't work)\n      * (2, 5): 6 - 40 = -34 (doesn't work)\n      * (5, 2): 15 - 16 = -1 (this works!)\n      * (10, 1): 30 - 8 = 22 (doesn't work)\n**4. Calculate AB + B:**\n   Since A = 5 and B = 2, we have AB + B = (5)(2) + 2 = **12**. \n",

Match coefficients with the original expression:**\n   We want this to be equal to 10x\u00b2 - x - 24.  This means:\n   * AB = 10 \n   * 3A - 8B = -1\n**3. Solve the system of equations:**\n   We have two equations and two unknowns.  We can solve for A and B. Here's one way to do it:\n   * From the first equation, AB = 10, we can see that A and B must be factors of 10.  Let's try some possibilities:\n      * If A = 1, then B = 10.  Does this work in the second equation?  3(1) - 8(10) = -77, which is not -1.  So this doesn't work.\n      * If A = 2, then B = 5.  Does this work?  3(2) - 8(5) = -34, which is not -1.  This doesn't work either.\n      * If A = 5, then B = 2.  Does this work?  3(5) - 8(2) = -1, which is correct!  \n**4. Calculate AB + B:**\n   Since we found A = 5 and B = 2, then:\n   AB + B = (5)(2) + 2 = **12** \n",
