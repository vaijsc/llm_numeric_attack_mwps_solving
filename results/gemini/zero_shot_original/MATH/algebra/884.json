    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The new length is $3491-60$, and the new width is $3491+60$.  Thus, the new area is\n\n$$(3491-60)(3491+60)=3491^2-60^2$$$3491^2$ is the area of the original square.  So the change in area is $60^2=\\boxed{3600}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Calculate the original area:**\n* The original area of the square is side * side = 3491 * 3491 = 12,201,881 square units.\n**2. Calculate the new dimensions:**\n* The new length is 3491 - 60 = 3431 units.\n* The new width is 3491 + 60 = 3551 units.\n**3. Calculate the new area:**\n* The new area is length * width = 3431 * 3551 = 12,201,881 square units.\n**4. Calculate the change in area:**\n* The change in area is new area - original area = 12,201,881 - 12,201,881 = 0 square units.\n**Answer:** The area of the square does not change. \n",
