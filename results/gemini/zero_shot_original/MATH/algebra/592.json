        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Identify the Pattern:**\n* Notice that the numbers in column E decrease by 9 as you move down the column (5, 16, 27, ...). \n**2.  Find the First and Last Number:**\n* The first number in column E is 5.\n* To find the last number, realize that the 50th number is in column E. So, the last number in column E is 50.\n**3.  Determine the Number of Terms:**\n* There are 50 counting numbers, and they are arranged in 5 columns. Therefore, there are 50/5 = 10 rows.\n**4.  Use the Arithmetic Series Formula:**\n* The sum of an arithmetic series is (n/2)(first term + last term), where 'n' is the number of terms.\n* In this case:  (10/2)(5 + 50) = 5 * 55 = **275**\n**Therefore, the sum of all the counting numbers in column E is 275.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Identify the Pattern**\nNotice that the numbers in column E are formed by subtracting 4 from the numbers in column A.\n* 5 = 1 + 4\n* 6 = 10 - 4\n* 15 = 11 + 4\n* 16 = 20 - 4 \n**2. Determine the Numbers in Column A**\nThe numbers in column A are multiples of 10, starting with 1 and increasing by 10 each time: 1, 11, 21, 31...\n**3. Calculate the Sum of the Numbers in Column E**\nSince the numbers in column E are formed by adding or subtracting 4 from the numbers in column A, let's first find the sum of the numbers in column A.\n* The sum of the first 5 multiples of 10 is (1 + 11 + 21 + 31 + 41) = 105 \nNow, to get the sum of the numbers in column E, we need to adjust for the +/- 4 pattern:\n* Add 4 five times (since there are 5 numbers in column E): 4 * 5 = 20\n* The sum of the numbers in column E is 105 + 20 = **125** \n**Therefore, the sum of all the counting numbers in column E is 125.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Identify the Pattern**\n* Notice that each row decreases by 1 from left to right.\n* The first number in each row is a multiple of 10.\n**2. Find the Numbers in Column E**\n* The first number in column E is 5.\n* Each subsequent number in column E is 9 less than the previous number (because the row decreases by 1 each time).\n**3. Determine the Sequence in Column E**\nThe numbers in column E form the following sequence:\n5, 6, 15, 16, 25, 26, ... , 45, 46\n**4. Calculate the Sum**\n* **Group the numbers:** Notice that you can group the numbers into pairs that add up to 51: (5 + 46), (6 + 45), (15 + 36), etc.\n* **Count the pairs:** There are 5 pairs in total.\n* **Calculate the total sum:** 5 pairs * 51 per pair = 255\n**Therefore, the sum of all the counting numbers in column E is 255.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Identify the Pattern:**\n* Notice that the numbers in column E form a decreasing arithmetic sequence: 5, 6, 15, 16...\n* The common difference is -10.\n**2. Find the Number of Terms:**\n* There are 50 counting numbers, and they are arranged in columns of 5.\n* Therefore, column E will have 50/5 = 10 terms.\n**3. Use the Arithmetic Series Formula:**\n* The sum (S) of an arithmetic series is: S = (n/2)(a + l)\n    * where 'n' is the number of terms, 'a' is the first term, and 'l' is the last term.\n**4. Find the Last Term:**\n* Since each term is 10 less than the previous one, the last term will be 5 - (10 * 9) = -85 \n**5. Calculate the Sum:**\n* S = (10/2)(5 + (-85))\n* S = 5 * (-80)\n* S = -400\n**Therefore, the sum of all the counting numbers in column E is -400.** \n",

Find the numbers in column E:**\n* We need to find all the numbers in column E that are less than or equal to 50.  \n* The numbers in column E follow this pattern:  5, 16, 27, 38, 49.\n**3. Calculate the sum:**\n* Add the numbers in column E: 5 + 16 + 27 + 38 + 49 = **135**\n**Therefore, the sum of all the counting numbers in column E is 135.** \n"
