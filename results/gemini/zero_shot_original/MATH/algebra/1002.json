        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Recognize the Patterns:**\n* **Numerator:** The numerator has a pattern of adding 2, then subtracting 4, then adding 6, and so on. \n* **Denominator:** The denominator also has a pattern of adding 3, then subtracting 6, then adding 9, and so on.\n**2. Simplify by Factoring:**\n* **Numerator:**  We can factor out a 2 from each term: \n   2(1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 - 6 + 7)\n* **Denominator:** We can factor out a 3 from each term:\n   3(1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 - 6 + 7)\n**3. Cancel Common Factors:**\nNotice that both the numerator and denominator share the same expression (1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 - 6 + 7).  We can cancel these out:\n  (2 * (1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 - 6 + 7)) / (3 * (1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 - 6 + 7)) = 2/3\n**Therefore, the fraction \\[\\frac{2-4+6-8+10-12+14}{3-6+9-12+15-18+21}\\] is equivalent to 2/3.** \n",
        "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n**1. Simplify the numerator:**\n* Notice that the numerator is a series of alternating additions and subtractions of even numbers.  We can group the terms: \n   (2 - 4) + (6 - 8) + (10 - 12) + 14  =  -2 - 2 - 2 + 14 = 8\n**2. Simplify the denominator:**\n*  The denominator follows the same pattern, but with odd numbers:\n   (3 - 6) + (9 - 12) + (15 - 18) + 21 = -3 - 3 - 3 + 21 = 12\n**3. The fraction:**\n* Now we have the fraction 8/12.\n**4. Simplify the fraction:**\n* Both the numerator and denominator are divisible by 4.  Simplifying gives us **2/3**. \nTherefore, the fraction \\[\\frac{2-4+6-8+10-12+14}{3-6+9-12+15-18+21}\\] is equivalent to **2/3**. \n",
