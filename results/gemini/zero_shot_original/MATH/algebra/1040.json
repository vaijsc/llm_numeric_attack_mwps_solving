Inspection reveals that $2x^2-7x-3$ does not easily factor, so we substitute the coefficients $2$, $-7$, and $-3$ into the quadratic formula:  \\[\n\\frac{-(-7)\\pm\\sqrt{(-7)^2-(4)(2)(-3)}}{2(2)}=\\frac{7\\pm\\sqrt{49+24}}{4}=\\frac{7\\pm\\sqrt{73}}{4}.\n\\]Therefore $m=7$, $n=73$, and $p=4$, so $m+n+p=7+73+4=\\boxed{84}$.",
