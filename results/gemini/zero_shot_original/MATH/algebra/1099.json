        "Here's how to solve the equation step-by-step:\n1. **Simplify the complex fraction:** \n   To get rid of the nested fraction, multiply both the numerator and denominator of the right side by $(x-2)$:\n   ```\n   x =  (1 * (x-2)) / ((2 + 1/(x-2)) * (x-2))\n   x = (x-2) / (2(x-2) + 1)\n   ```\n2. **Multiply both sides by the denominator:** \n   To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by the denominator:\n   ```\n   x(2(x-2) + 1) = (x-2) \n   ```\n3. **Expand and rearrange:** \n   Expand the left side and move all terms to one side:\n   ```\n   2x^2 - 4x + x = x - 2\n   2x^2 - 6x + 2 = 0\n   ```\n4. **Solve the quadratic equation:** \n   Divide the equation by 2 to simplify:\n   ```\n   x^2 - 3x + 1 = 0\n   ```\n   Use the quadratic formula to find the solutions:\n   ```\n   x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n   ```\n   where a = 1, b = -3, and c = 1.\n   ```\n   x = (3 \u00b1 \u221a((-3)^2 - 4 * 1 * 1)) / (2 * 1)\n   x = (3 \u00b1 \u221a5) / 2\n   ```\n5. **Find the positive solution:**\n   We have two solutions:\n   * x = (3 + \u221a5) / 2  (positive)\n   * x = (3 - \u221a5) / 2  (negative)\n   The positive solution is **x = (3 + \u221a5) / 2**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the equation step-by-step:\n1. **Simplify the complex fraction:** \n   To get rid of the nested fraction, multiply both the numerator and denominator of the right side by  (x - 2):\n   ```\n   x =  (1 * (x - 2)) / ((2 + 1/(x-2)) * (x - 2)) \n   x = (x - 2) / (2(x - 2) + 1)\n   ```\n2. **Multiply both sides by the denominator:**\n   To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides of the equation by the denominator:\n   ```\n   x * (2(x - 2) + 1) = x - 2 \n   ```\n3. **Expand and simplify:**\n   Distribute and simplify:\n   ```\n   2x\u00b2 - 3x + 1 = x - 2\n   2x\u00b2 - 4x + 3 = 0\n   ```\n4. **Solve the quadratic equation:**\n   This is a quadratic equation.  We can try to factor it, but it doesn't factor easily.  Let's use the quadratic formula:\n   ```\n   x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / 2a \n   ```\n   Where  a = 2, b = -4, and c = 3.\n   ```\n   x = (4 \u00b1 \u221a((-4)\u00b2 - 4 * 2 * 3)) / (2 * 2)\n   x = (4 \u00b1 \u221a(-8)) / 4\n   x = (4 \u00b1 2\u221a2 * i) / 4\n   x = 1 \u00b1 (\u221a2 / 2) * i\n   ```\n   We get two solutions, both complex numbers.\n**Conclusion:**\nSince the problem asks for the *positive* solution, there is **no positive solution** to the equation.

        "Here's how to solve the equation step-by-step:\n1. **Simplify the denominator:**  Start by simplifying the complex fraction on the right side of the equation:\n   ```\n   x =  1 / (2 + 1/(x-2)) \n   x = 1 / ((2(x-2) + 1) / (x-2))\n   x = (x-2) / (2x - 3)\n   ```\n2. **Multiply both sides by the denominator:** Get rid of the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by (2x - 3):\n   ```\n   x(2x - 3) = x - 2\n   ```\n3. **Expand and rearrange:** Expand the left side and move all terms to one side:\n   ```\n   2x\u00b2 - 3x = x - 2\n   2x\u00b2 - 4x + 2 = 0 \n   ```\n4. **Solve the quadratic equation:**  The equation is now in the standard quadratic form (ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0). We can solve this by factoring or using the quadratic formula.  Let's factor:\n   ```\n   2(x\u00b2 - 2x + 1) = 0\n   2(x - 1)\u00b2 = 0\n   ```\n   Therefore, x = 1 is the solution. \n**The positive solution to the equation is x = 1.** \n",
