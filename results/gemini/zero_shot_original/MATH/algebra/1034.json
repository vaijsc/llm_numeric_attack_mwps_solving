    "problem": "In a $100$ meter track event, Alice runs at a constant speed and crosses the finish line $5$ seconds before Beatrice does. If it took Beatrice $25$ seconds to complete the race, how many seconds would it take Alice to run $50$ meters?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Alice took $25 - 5 = 20$ seconds to complete the race. If she can run $100$ meters in $20$ seconds, by direct proportionality, she must be able to run $\\frac{100}{2} = 50$ meters in $\\frac{20}{2} = \\boxed{10}$ seconds.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find Alice's finishing time:**\n* Beatrice finished in 25 seconds.\n* Alice finished 5 seconds earlier, so she finished in 25 - 5 = 20 seconds.\n**2. Calculate Alice's speed:**\n* Alice ran 100 meters in 20 seconds.\n* Her speed is 100 meters / 20 seconds = 5 meters per second.\n**3. Calculate the time Alice takes to run 50 meters:**\n* Alice runs at 5 meters per second.\n* To run 50 meters, it would take her 50 meters / 5 meters/second = 10 seconds.\n**Therefore, it would take Alice 10 seconds to run 50 meters.** \n",
