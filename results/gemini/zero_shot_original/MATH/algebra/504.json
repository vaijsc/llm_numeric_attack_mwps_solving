        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Set the equations equal to each other:**\nSince we want the points of intersection, we need to find the values of *x* where the *y* values of both equations are equal. So we set the equations equal to each other:\nx\u00b2 + a = ax\n**2. Rearrange the equation into a quadratic:**\nSubtract *ax* from both sides to get a quadratic equation in standard form:\nx\u00b2 - ax + a = 0\n**3. Use the discriminant to find the conditions for intersection:**\nFor the graphs to intersect, the quadratic equation must have at least one real solution.  The discriminant of a quadratic equation (ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0) is b\u00b2 - 4ac.  The quadratic has real solutions if and only if the discriminant is non-negative.\nIn our equation, a = 1, b = -a, and c = a.  So, the discriminant is:\n(-a)\u00b2 - 4(1)(a) = a\u00b2 - 4a\nWe want this to be non-negative:\na\u00b2 - 4a \u2265 0\n**4. Solve the inequality:**\nFactor the left side:\na(a - 4) \u2265 0\nThis inequality is true when:\n* a \u2264 0  (both factors are non-positive)\n* a \u2265 4  (both factors are non-negative)\n**5. Express the solution in interval notation:**\nThe solution in interval notation is:\n**(-\u221e, 0] \u222a [4, \u221e)** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Set up the equations**\nSince we want the graphs to intersect, we need to find the values of *x* and *y* that satisfy both equations:\n*  *y* = *x*\u00b2 + *a* \n*  *y* = *ax*\n**2. Substitute to eliminate *y***\nSince both equations equal *y*, we can set them equal to each other:\n* *x*\u00b2 + *a* = *ax*\n**3. Rearrange the equation into a quadratic**\nSubtract *ax* from both sides to get a quadratic equation:\n* *x*\u00b2 - *ax* + *a* = 0\n**4. Use the discriminant to determine the number of solutions**\nFor a quadratic equation of the form *ax*\u00b2 + *bx* + *c* = 0, the discriminant is *b*\u00b2 - 4*ac*.  The discriminant tells us the nature of the roots (solutions):\n* **Discriminant > 0:** Two distinct real roots (the graphs intersect at two points)\n* **Discriminant = 0:** One real root (the graphs touch at one point)\n* **Discriminant < 0:** No real roots (the graphs don't intersect)\nIn our quadratic, *a* = 1, *b* = -*a*, and *c* = *a*.  Therefore, the discriminant is:\n* (-*a*)\u00b2 - 4(1)(*a*) = *a*\u00b2 - 4*a*\nWe want the graphs to intersect, so we need the discriminant to be greater than zero:\n* *a*\u00b2 - 4*a* > 0\n**5. Solve the inequality**\nFactor the inequality:\n* *a*(*a* - 4) > 0\nThe inequality is true when both factors are positive or when both factors are negative:\n* **Case 1:** *a* > 0 and *a* - 4 > 0  =>  *a* > 4\n* **Case 2:** *a* < 0 and *a* - 4 < 0  =>  *a* < 0\n**6. Express the solution in interval notation**\nCombining the solutions from both cases, we get:\n* *a* \u2208 (-\u221e, 0) \u222a (4, \u221e)\n**Therefore, the values of *a* for which the graphs of *y* = *x*\u00b2 + *a* and *y* = *ax* intersect are all numbers in the interval (-\u221e, 0) \u222a (4, \u221e).** \n",
