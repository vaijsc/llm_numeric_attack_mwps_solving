Expand both sides of the equation:**\n* Expand the left side: \n   (x\u00b2 - 4x + 3)(x + 5) = x\u00b3 + x\u00b2 - 20x + 15 \n* Expand the right side: \n   (x\u00b2 + 4x - 5)(x - c) = x\u00b3 + (4-c)x\u00b2 + (-4c-5)x + 5c\n**2. Set the expanded expressions equal to each other:**\nx\u00b3 + x\u00b2 - 20x + 15 = x\u00b3 + (4-c)x\u00b2 + (-4c-5)x + 5c\n**3.  Match coefficients:**\nFor the equation to hold for all values of x, the coefficients of each power of x must be equal on both sides. This gives us a system of equations:\n* **x\u00b3 coefficient:**  1 = 1  (This is already true)\n* **x\u00b2 coefficient:** 1 = 4 - c\n* **x coefficient:**  -20 = -4c - 5\n* **Constant term:** 15 = 5c\n**4. Solve for c:**\n* From the x\u00b2 coefficient equation: c = 3\n* **Verify:**  Let's check if this value of 'c' satisfies the other equations:\n    * -20 = -4(3) - 5   (True)\n    * 15 = 5(3)           (True)\n**Therefore, the constant c = 3.** \n",

Solve for 'c'**\nFor this equation to hold true for *all* values of *x*, the coefficients of each power of *x* must be zero.

        "1. **Expand both sides:**  We start by expanding the products on both sides of the equation: \n   \n   *  Left side: $(x^2-4x+3)(x+5) = x^3 + x^2 - 20x + 15$\n   *  Right side: $(x^2+4x-5)(x-c) = x^3 + (4-c)x^2 + (-5c - 4)x + 5c$\n2. **Set the expressions equal:**  We want the equation to hold for all values of $x$.  This means the coefficients of corresponding powers of $x$ must be equal on both sides.  \n   *  The coefficients of $x^3$ are already equal (both are 1).\n   *  The coefficients of $x^2$ must be equal:  $1 = 4 - c$\n   *  The coefficients of $x$ must be equal:  $-20 = -5c - 4$\n   *  The constant terms must be equal:  $15 = 5c$\n3. **Solve for c:** We can solve any of the equations above to find the value of $c$.  Let's use the equation $1 = 4 - c$:\n   *  Subtract 4 from both sides: $-3 = -c$\n   *  Multiply both sides by -1:  $c = \\boxed{3}$\n**Checking our answer:** We can substitute $c = 3$ back into the original equation to verify that it holds for all values of $x$.  You'll find that both sides simplify to the same expression. \n",
