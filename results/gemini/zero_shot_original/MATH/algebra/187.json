    "problem": "The combined weight of three basset hounds is $185$ pounds. The two smaller dogs weigh the same. The difference between the larger weight and the smaller weight is $20$ pounds. How many pounds does the largest dog weigh?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let the three basset hounds weigh $a$, $a$, and $b$ pounds, where $a < b$. We have the two equations \\begin{align*}\n2a+b&=185\\\\\nb-a&=20\n\\end{align*} From the second equation, we have $a=b-20$. Substituting this in to the first equation to eliminate $a$, we have $2(b-20)+b=185 \\Rightarrow b=75$. Thus, the largest dog weighs $\\boxed{75}$ pounds.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Define Variables:**\n* Let  'x' represent the weight of each of the two smaller dogs.\n* Let 'x + 20' represent the weight of the largest dog.\n**2. Set up an Equation:**\nThe combined weight of all three dogs is 185 pounds, so:\nx + x + (x + 20) = 185\n**3. Solve for x:**\n* Combine like terms: 3x + 20 = 185\n* Subtract 20 from both sides: 3x = 165\n* Divide both sides by 3: x = 55 \n**4. Find the Weight of the Largest Dog:**\n* The largest dog weighs x + 20 pounds.\n* Substitute x = 55: 55 + 20 = 75\n**Answer:** The largest dog weighs **75 pounds**. \n",
