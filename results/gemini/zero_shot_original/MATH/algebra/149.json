        "Here's how to break down the problem:\n* **Positive square root of 64:**  This is the number that, when multiplied by itself, equals 64.  The positive square root of 64 is 8 (since 8 * 8 = 64).\n* **Cube root of 64:** This is the number that, when multiplied by itself three times, equals 64. The cube root of 64 is 4 (since 4 * 4 * 4 = 64).\n**The difference:** 8 - 4 = 4\n**Therefore, the difference between the positive square root of 64 and the cube root of 64 is 4.** \n",
        "Here's how to break down the problem:\n**1. Positive Square Root of 64**\n* The square root of a number is the value that, when multiplied by itself, equals the original number. \n* The positive square root of 64 is 8, because 8 * 8 = 64.\n**2. Cube Root of 64**\n* The cube root of a number is the value that, when multiplied by itself three times, equals the original number.\n* The cube root of 64 is 4, because 4 * 4 * 4 = 64.\n**3. The Difference**\n* The difference between the positive square root of 64 (8) and the cube root of 64 (4) is 8 - 4 = **4**. \n",
