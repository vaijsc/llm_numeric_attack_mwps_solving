        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n* **Understand the formula:**  Force (F) = Mass (m) * Acceleration (a)\n* **Equal Force:** Jen and Jack apply the same force (F).\n* **Let's represent the accelerations:**  Let Jen's acceleration be \"a_j\" and Jack's acceleration be \"a_j\".\n* **Set up the equations:** \n    *  For Jen:  F = 200g * a_j\n    *  For Jack: F = 150g * a_j\n* **Since the forces are equal, we can set the equations equal to each other:** 200g * a_j = 150g * a_j\n* **Solve for the ratio of accelerations:** Divide both sides by 150g * a_j: \n    * (200g * a_j) / (150g * a_j) = 1\n    * This simplifies to: (200/150) * (a_j/a_j) = 1\n    * Since a_j/a_j = 1, we have: (200/150) = 1\n    * Now, simplify the fraction 200/150 to get **4/3**.\n**Therefore, the ratio of Jen's acceleration to Jack's acceleration is 4/3.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Understand the relationship:**\n* The formula **Force = Mass x Acceleration** tells us that force is directly proportional to both mass and acceleration.  This means if you increase the mass or acceleration, the force will also increase.\n**2. Set up the problem:**\n* Jen's softball has a mass of 200 g.\n* Jack's baseball has a mass of 150 g.\n* They want to throw with the same force.\n**3. Use the formula to find the ratio of accelerations:**\n* Since the force is the same, we can set up a proportion:\n   * (Jen's Force) = (Jen's Mass) x (Jen's Acceleration)\n   * (Jack's Force) = (Jack's Mass) x (Jack's Acceleration)\n* Since the forces are equal, we can write:\n   * (Jen's Mass) x (Jen's Acceleration) = (Jack's Mass) x (Jack's Acceleration)\n* We want to find the ratio of Jen's acceleration to Jack's acceleration, which is:\n   * (Jen's Acceleration) / (Jack's Acceleration)\n* Let's solve for this ratio by dividing both sides of the equation by (Jack's Mass) and (Jen's Acceleration):\n   * [(Jen's Mass) x (Jen's Acceleration)] / [(Jack's Mass) x (Jen's Acceleration)] = [(Jack's Mass) x (Jack's Acceleration)] / [(Jack's Mass) x (Jen's Acceleration)]\n* Simplifying, we get:\n   * (Jen's Mass) / (Jack's Mass) = (Jack's Acceleration) / (Jen's Acceleration)\n**4. Calculate the ratio:**\n* (Jen's Mass) / (Jack's Mass) = 200 g / 150 g = 4/3\n**5. Answer:**\n* The ratio of Jen's acceleration to Jack's acceleration is **4/3**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Formula:**\n*  Force (F) = Mass (m) x Acceleration (a)\n**2. Set up the Problem:**\n* Let's call Jen's acceleration *a<sub>J</sub>* and Jack's acceleration *a<sub>J</sub>*.\n* We know Jen and Jack throw with the same force, so F<sub>J</sub> = F<sub>J</sub>.\n* We're given the masses: m<sub>J</sub> = 200 g and m<sub>J</sub> = 150 g.\n**3. Apply the Formula:**\n* Since the forces are equal, we can write: \n   * m<sub>J</sub> * a<sub>J</sub> = m<sub>J</sub> * a<sub>J</sub>\n**4. Solve for the Ratio of Accelerations:**\n* Divide both sides of the equation by m<sub>J</sub> * a<sub>J</sub>:\n   * a<sub>J</sub> / a<sub>J</sub> = m<sub>J</sub> / m<sub>J</sub>\n* Substitute the given masses:\n   * a<sub>J</sub> / a<sub>J</sub> = 200 g / 150 g \n* Simplify the fraction:\n   * a<sub>J</sub> / a<sub>J</sub> = **4/3**\n**Therefore, the ratio of Jen's acceleration to Jack's acceleration is 4/3.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Formula:**\n*  Force (F) = Mass (m) * Acceleration (a)\n**2. Set up the Problem:**\n* We want the force of Jen's throw (F_jen) to be equal to the force of Jack's throw (F_jack).\n*  Let a_jen be the acceleration of Jen's softball.\n*  Let a_jack be the acceleration of Jack's baseball.\n**3. Write Equations:**\n* F_jen = m_jen * a_jen  (where m_jen = 200 g)\n* F_jack = m_jack * a_jack (where m_jack = 150 g)\n**4. Set Forces Equal:**\nSince F_jen = F_jack, we have:\n* m_jen * a_jen = m_jack * a_jack\n**5. Solve for the Ratio:**\n*  a_jen / a_jack = m_jack / m_jen\n*  a_jen / a_jack = 150 g / 200 g \n*  a_jen / a_jack = 3/4\n**Answer:** The ratio of Jen's softball acceleration to Jack's baseball acceleration is **3/4**. \n",

Set Up the Problem:**\n* Let the force Jen throws with be F.\n* Let Jack's acceleration be a.\n* Jen's acceleration is unknown, let's call it a'. \n**3. Apply the Formula:**\n* For Jen: F = 0.2 kg * a'  (Convert grams to kilograms: 200g = 0.2 kg)\n* For Jack: F = 0.15 kg * a \n**4.  Solve for the Ratio:**\n* Since the force is the same for both, we can set the equations equal: 0.2 kg * a' = 0.15 kg * a\n* Divide both sides by 0.15 kg * a' to isolate the ratio: (0.2 kg * a') / (0.15 kg * a') = (0.15 kg * a) / (0.15 kg * a')\n* Simplify: 0.2/0.15 = a/a'\n* Further simplification:  4/3 = a/a'\n**Answer:** The ratio of Jen's acceleration to Jack's acceleration is **4/3**. \n"
