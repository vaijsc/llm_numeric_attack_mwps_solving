        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the problem:**\nWe are given a piecewise function  \\[ f(x) =\n\\begin{cases}\nax^2 & \\text{if } x \\geq a,\\\\\nax +2a& \\text{if } x <a,\n\\end{cases}\n\\]. \nThe question asks for the largest value of 'a' for which the graph of this function intersects every horizontal line at least once. This means the graph must extend to both positive and negative infinity in the y-direction.\n**2. Analyze the function:**\n* **For x \u2265 a:** The function is f(x) = ax\u00b2. This is a parabola opening upwards if a > 0. As x approaches infinity, ax\u00b2 also approaches infinity. \n* **For x < a:** The function is f(x) = ax + 2a. This is a straight line with a slope of 'a'.  \n**3. Determine the conditions for intersection with every horizontal line:**\n* **Positive infinity:**  For the graph to extend to positive infinity, the parabola (ax\u00b2) must have a positive leading coefficient. This means  **a > 0**.\n* **Negative infinity:** For the graph to extend to negative infinity, we need to analyze the line (ax + 2a) as x approaches negative infinity.  Since the slope is 'a', if 'a' is positive, the line will approach positive infinity as x goes to negative infinity. This is not what we want.  Therefore, **a must be negative**.\n**4. Finding the largest value of 'a':**\nSince we need 'a' to be both positive and negative, there's no value of 'a' that can satisfy both conditions simultaneously. Therefore, there's no value of 'a' for which the graph of y=f(x) intersects every horizontal line at least once.\n**Answer:** There is no such value of 'a'. \n",
        "Here's a step-by-step solution to find the largest value of 'a':\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\nThe problem asks for the largest 'a' for which the function's graph crosses every horizontal line. This means the function must be *unbounded* in both the positive and negative y-directions.\n**2. Analyzing the Function**\n* **Case 1: x \u2265 a**\n    * The function is a parabola,  y = ax\u00b2.  Since 'a' is a coefficient, it determines the parabola's shape and direction.\n    * If 'a' is positive, the parabola opens upwards, and it will become infinitely large as x goes to infinity.\n    * If 'a' is negative, the parabola opens downwards, and it will become infinitely small as x goes to infinity.\n* **Case 2: x < a**\n    * The function is a line, y = ax + 2a. \n    * This line has a slope of 'a'.\n    * If 'a' is positive, the line slopes upwards to the right.\n    * If 'a' is negative, the line slopes downwards to the right.\n**3. Finding the Critical Value of 'a'**\nWe need to ensure that the function goes to both positive and negative infinity. \n* **Positive Infinity:** The parabola (Case 1) will ensure this as long as 'a' is positive.\n* **Negative Infinity:** The line (Case 2) will ensure this if the slope 'a' is negative.\nThis leads to a contradiction: 'a' must be both positive and negative to satisfy the problem's requirement.  The only way to resolve this is if the two parts of the function connect at a point where they both have the same y-value.\n**4. Connecting the Pieces**\nLet's find the point where the two pieces meet. This occurs at x = a:\n* **Parabola:**  y = a(a)\u00b2 = a\u00b3\n* **Line:** y = a(a) + 2a = a\u00b2 + 2a\nFor them to connect, these y-values must be equal:\na\u00b3 = a\u00b2 + 2a\n**5. Solving for 'a'**\na\u00b3 - a\u00b2 - 2a = 0\na(a\u00b2 - a - 2) = 0\na(a - 2)(a + 1) = 0\nThis gives us three possible solutions: a = 0, a = 2, and a = -1.\n* **a = 0:**  The function becomes y = 0 for all x, which doesn't intersect all horizontal lines.\n* **a = -1:** The parabola opens downwards, and the line slopes downwards. This function will not go to positive infinity.\n* **a = 2:**  The parabola opens upwards, and the line slopes upwards.  This function goes to both positive and negative infinity.\n**6. The Answer**\nTherefore, the largest value of 'a' that satisfies the given conditions is **a = 2**. \n",
        "Here's a step-by-step explanation to find the largest value of 'a':\n**Understanding the Problem:**\nThe problem asks us to find the largest value of 'a' for which the function `f(x)` intersects every horizontal line. This means that for any given y-value, there must be at least one x-value that satisfies the equation `f(x) = y`.\n**Analyzing the Function:**\n* **For x \u2265 a:** The function is a parabola, `f(x) = ax^2`. This part of the function opens upwards (since 'a' is positive), and it intersects every horizontal line above the vertex of the parabola.\n* **For x < a:** The function is a straight line, `f(x) = ax + 2a`. This part of the function has a positive slope ('a' is positive) and intersects every horizontal line.\n**The Key Observation:**\nThe key is to ensure that the parabola intersects all horizontal lines *below* its vertex. If the parabola's vertex is at a y-value higher than some horizontal line, that horizontal line wouldn't be intersected.\n**Finding the Vertex:**\nThe vertex of the parabola `f(x) = ax^2` is at `(0, 0)`. This means the lowest point of the parabola is at y = 0.\n**Connecting the Pieces:**\nTo ensure every horizontal line is intersected, the line `f(x) = ax + 2a` must intersect the y-axis at a point below the vertex of the parabola (i.e., at a y-value less than 0). This means:\n* `f(0) < 0` \n* `a(0) + 2a < 0`\n* `2a < 0`\n* `a < 0`\n**The Answer:**\nSince 'a' must be less than 0 to ensure every horizontal line is intersected, the largest possible value of 'a' is **negative infinity**. \n**Important Note:** The function is not actually defined for negative values of 'a' because the original definition specifies that 'a' is a positive number.  Therefore, there's no solution in the context of the original function definition. However, the logic above explains the concept of what 'a' would need to be to satisfy the given condition. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step by step:\n**Understanding the Problem**\nThe question asks us to find the largest value of 'a' for which the function *f(x)* intersects every horizontal line. This means that for any given y-value, there should be at least one x-value where the function's graph crosses that y-value.\n**Analyzing the Function**\n* **Case 1:  x \u2265 a**  The function is a parabola, opening upwards, with its vertex at (a, 0). \n* **Case 2: x < a** The function is a line with slope 'a' and y-intercept 2a.\n**Finding the Critical Point**\nThe key to this problem is the point where the two pieces of the function meet, at x = a.  We need to make sure that the function is continuous at this point.  This means:\n* The y-values of the parabola and the line must be equal at x = a.\nLet's calculate:\n* **Parabola at x = a:**  f(a) = a * a\u00b2 = a\u00b3\n* **Line at x = a:** f(a) = a * a + 2a = 2a\u00b2\nFor continuity, we need:\na\u00b3 = 2a\u00b2 \n**Solving for 'a'**\n1. Divide both sides by a\u00b2 (since a cannot be 0):\n   a = 2\n**Checking for Validity**\nWe found a = 2, but we need to make sure this value actually guarantees intersection with every horizontal line.\n* **Parabola:** When a = 2, the parabola is f(x) = 2x\u00b2.  This parabola will extend upwards indefinitely, intersecting all y-values greater than or equal to 0.\n* **Line:**  When a = 2, the line is f(x) = 2x + 4.  This line will extend downwards indefinitely, intersecting all y-values less than 0.\n**Conclusion**\nThe largest value of 'a' that satisfies the condition is **a = 2**.  For any larger value of 'a', the graph of f(x) will have a gap between the parabola and the line, preventing it from intersecting all horizontal lines. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understanding the problem:**\n* We are given a piecewise function, meaning it has different definitions for different parts of its domain.\n* We need to find the largest value of 'a' that makes the graph of the function intersect every horizontal line. This means the function must cover all possible y-values.\n**2. Analyzing the function:**\n* For *x \u2265 a*, the function is a parabola *f(x) = ax\u00b2*. This parabola opens upwards (since 'a' is positive) and its vertex is at the origin (0, 0).\n* For *x < a*, the function is a straight line *f(x) = ax + 2a*. This line has a slope of 'a' and a y-intercept of 2a.\n**3. Identifying the key points:**\n*  The key is to understand how the two parts of the function connect at x = a.  \n* At x = a, both parts of the function should have the same y-value for the graph to be continuous. Let's calculate this value:\n    * For *x \u2265 a*,  f(a) = a\u00b2\n    * For *x < a*, f(a) = a\u00b2 + 2a\n* To make the function continuous, these two values must be equal:\n    * a\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + 2a\n    * 0 = 2a\n    * a = 0\n**4. Analyzing the case when a = 0:**\n* When a = 0, the function becomes:\n   * f(x) = 0 for x \u2265 0\n   * f(x) = 0 for x < 0\n* This means the graph is a horizontal line at y = 0, and it does not intersect any other horizontal line.\n**5. Finding the largest possible 'a':**\n* Since a = 0 doesn't work, we need to consider positive values of 'a'. \n* As 'a' increases, the parabola *ax\u00b2* becomes steeper and the line *ax + 2a* also gets a steeper slope.\n* Since the line has a y-intercept of 2a, it will always intersect the y-axis.\n* The parabola, on the other hand, will eventually have a y-value greater than any positive value of 2a.\n**6. Conclusion:**\n* Therefore, there is no largest value of 'a' that ensures the graph intersects every horizontal line.  As 'a' increases, the gap between the parabola and the line at very high y-values will always exist, leaving a horizontal line that the graph won't intersect. \n**Final Answer:** There is no largest value of 'a' that satisfies the given condition. \n"
