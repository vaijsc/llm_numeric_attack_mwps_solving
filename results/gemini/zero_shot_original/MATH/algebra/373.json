        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n1. **Identify the values:**  We are given that K = 6 and L = 5.\n2. **Substitute the values into the operation:**  \n   The operation is defined as  K * L = (K + L)(K - L). \n   Substituting our values, we get: 6 * 5 = (6 + 5)(6 - 5)\n3. **Simplify the expression:**\n   * (6 + 5) = 11\n   * (6 - 5) = 1\n   * So, 6 * 5 = 11 * 1\n4. **Calculate the final result:**\n   * 11 * 1 = 11\n**Therefore, 6 * 5 = 11** \n",
