        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Set up the equation:**\nWe want to find the time (t) when the height (y) is 77 feet. So we set up the equation:\n   77 = -6t\u00b2 + 43t\n**2. Rearrange the equation into a quadratic form:**\n   0 = -6t\u00b2 + 43t - 77\n**3. Solve the quadratic equation:**\nWe can solve for 't' using the quadratic formula:\n   t = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n   where a = -6, b = 43, and c = -77\n   t = (-43 \u00b1 \u221a(43\u00b2 - 4 * -6 * -77)) / (2 * -6)\n   t = (-43 \u00b1 \u221a(1849 - 1848)) / -12\n   t = (-43 \u00b1 \u221a1) / -12\n**4.

Choose the valid solution:**\nSince we are looking for the *first* time the projectile reaches 77 feet, the correct answer is the smaller value of 't'.\n**Answer:** The projectile will first reach 77 feet in height after approximately **3.5 seconds**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Set up the equation:**\nWe know the height of the projectile is given by the equation: \n  *  y = -6t\u00b2 + 43t\nWe want to find the time (t) when the height (y) is 77 feet. So we set up the equation:\n  *  77 = -6t\u00b2 + 43t\n**2. Rearrange the equation:**\nTo solve for *t*, we need to rearrange the equation into a quadratic equation (where one side is equal to zero):\n  *  0 = -6t\u00b2 + 43t - 77\n**3. Solve the quadratic equation:**\nThere are a couple of ways to solve this:\n* **Quadratic Formula:** \n   The quadratic formula solves for *t* in an equation of the form ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0:\n     *  t = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n   In our equation, a = -6, b = 43, and c = -77.  Substitute these values into the formula and solve for *t*. You'll get two possible solutions.\n* **Factoring:**\n   Sometimes quadratic equations can be factored. In this case, we can factor the equation as:\n    * (2t - 11)(-3t + 7) = 0\n   This means either (2t - 11) = 0 or (-3t + 7) = 0. Solve each of these equations for *t* to find the two possible solutions.\n**4. Choose the correct solution:**\nYou'll get two solutions for *t*. Since we're looking for the first time the projectile reaches 77 feet, choose the smaller value of *t*.\n**5. Round to the nearest tenth:**\nRound the smaller solution for *t* to the nearest tenth.\n**Let's do the calculation using the quadratic formula:**\n* t = (-43 \u00b1 \u221a(43\u00b2 - 4 * -6 * -77)) / (2 * -6)\n* t = (-43 \u00b1 \u221a(1849 - 1848)) / -12\n* t = (-43 \u00b1 1) / -12\nThis gives us two solutions:\n* t = (-43 + 1) / -12 = 3.5 seconds \n* t = (-43 - 1) / -12 = 3.67 seconds (approximately)\nThe smaller solution is **t = 3.5 seconds**.\n**Answer:** The projectile will first reach 77 feet in height after **3.5 seconds**. \n",
