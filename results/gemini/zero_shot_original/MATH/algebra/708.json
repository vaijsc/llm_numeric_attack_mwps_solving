        "Here's how to find the domain of the function:\n**1. Restrictions due to the square root:**\n* The expression under a square root must be non-negative. \n   *  Therefore,  $x \\ge 0$  (for the numerator, $\\sqrt{x}$)\n   *  Also,  $1-x^2 \\ge 0$  (for the denominator, $\\sqrt{1-x^2}$)\n**2. Solving the inequality:**\n*  $1-x^2 \\ge 0$ can be factored as $(1+x)(1-x) \\ge 0$.  This inequality holds when:\n    *  Both factors are non-negative: $1+x \\ge 0$ and $1-x \\ge 0$, which leads to $-1 \\le x \\le 1$.\n    *  Both factors are non-positive: $1+x \\le 0$ and $1-x \\le 0$, which is impossible.\n**3. Combining restrictions:**\n*  We need both $x \\ge 0$ and $-1 \\le x \\le 1$. \n*  The intersection of these two conditions is  $0 \\le x < 1$.\n**4.  Restriction due to the denominator:**\n* The denominator cannot be zero. \n*  So, $1-x^2 \\neq 0$. This means $x \\neq 1$ and $x \\neq -1$.\n**5. Final Domain:**\n*  Combining all restrictions, the domain of the function is:  **[0, 1)** \n",
        "Here's how to find the domain of the function:\n**1.  Radicals:**\n* The square root of a number is only defined for non-negative values.
