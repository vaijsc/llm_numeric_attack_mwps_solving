    "problem": "Five people can mow a lawn in 12 hours.  How many more people are needed to mow the lawn in just 3 hours, assuming each person mows at the same rate?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The number of people mowing and the time required to mow are inversely proportional. Letting $n$ be the number of people and $t$ be the amount of time, we have $nt = (5)(12)= 60$ because 5 people can mow a lawn in 12 hours. If $m$ people can mow the lawn in 3 hours, then we must have $m(3) = 60$, so $m=20$.  Therefore, we need to add $20-5 = \\boxed{15}$ people to the job.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Calculate the total work:**\n* If 5 people mow the lawn in 12 hours, they complete 5 * 12 = 60 \"person-hours\" of work.\n**2. Determine the work needed per hour:**\n* To finish in 3 hours, you need to complete 60 person-hours / 3 hours = 20 person-hours of work per hour.\n**3. Calculate the additional people needed:**\n* Since each person contributes 1 person-hour of work per hour, you need 20 person-hours / 1 person-hour/person = 20 people.\n**4. Find the difference:**\n* You need 20 people - 5 people = 15 more people.\n**Answer:** You need **15 more people** to mow the lawn in 3 hours. \n",

Determine the work needed per hour:**\n* To mow the lawn in 3 hours, you need 60 person-hours / 3 hours = 20 people working per hour.\n**3. Find the additional people needed:**\n* You currently have 5 people, and you need 20 people per hour, so you need 20 - 5 = 15 more people.\n**Answer:** You need 15 more people to mow the lawn in 3 hours. \n",

You only need **4 people** to mow the lawn in 3 hours. \n"
