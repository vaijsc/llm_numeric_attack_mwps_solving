        "Here's how to find the center of the circle:\n**1. Complete the Square**\n* **Rearrange the terms:** Group the *x* terms together, the *y* terms together, and move the constant to the right side of the equation:\n   (x\u00b2 + 14x) + (y\u00b2 - 6y) = -53\n* **Complete the square for x:** Take half of the coefficient of *x* (which is 14), square it (14/2 = 7, 7\u00b2 = 49), and add it to both sides of the equation.\n   (x\u00b2 + 14x + 49) + (y\u00b2 - 6y) = -53 + 49\n* **Complete the square for y:** Take half of the coefficient of *y* (which is -6), square it ((-6)/2 = -3, (-3)\u00b2 = 9), and add it to both sides of the equation.\n   (x\u00b2 + 14x + 49) + (y\u00b2 - 6y + 9) = -53 + 49 + 9\n**2.

Identify the Center**\n* **From the equation, we see:**\n    * h = -7\n    * k = 3\n**Therefore, the center of the circle is (-7, 3).** \n",
