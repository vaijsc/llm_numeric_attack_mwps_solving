    "problem": "Phoenix hiked the Rocky Path Trail last week. It took four days to complete the trip. The first two days she hiked a total of 26 miles. The second and third days she averaged 12 miles per day. The last two days she hiked a total of 28 miles. The total hike for the first and third days was 22 miles. How many miles long was the trail?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let the number of miles Phoenix hiked in each day be $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$. We have the equations \\begin{align*}\na+b&=26\\\\\n(b+c)/2=12 \\Rightarrow b+c&=24\\\\\nc+d&=28\\\\\na+c&=22\n\\end{align*} Adding the first two equations gives $a+2b+c=50$. Subtracting the fourth equation from this last equation, we have $2b=28$, or $b=14$. Plugging this value of $b$ into the first given equation to solve for $a$, we find that $a=12$. Plugging this value of $a$ into the fourth given equation to solve for $c$, we find that $c=10$. Finally, plugging $c$ into the third equation gives $d=18$. Thus, the entire trail was $a+b+c+d=12+14+10+18=\\boxed{54}$ miles long.\n\nOf course, you could also have realized that the total for the first two days was 26 miles and the total for the last two days was 28 miles, meaning that the total for all four days is $26 + 28 = \\boxed{54}$ miles.",

        "Here's how we can break down the problem to find the total length of the trail:\n**1. Second and Third Day:**\n* Phoenix hiked 12 miles per day for two days, so she hiked a total of 12 * 2 = 24 miles.\n**2. Third Day:**\n* We know the first and third days combined were 22 miles. \n* Since the first two days were 26 miles, the third day must have been 22 - 26 = -4 miles. This isn't possible, so we need to re-examine the information. It seems there might be an error in the problem statement.\n**3. Finding the Missing Information:**\n* We can't find the total trail length with the given information.  We need to either know the distance of the third day or the distance of the first day to solve this problem. \n**Let's assume the problem meant to say the total hike for the first and *second* days was 22 miles, not the first and third.**  If that's the case, we can continue:\n**4. First Day:**\n* The first two days were 22 miles, and the first two days combined were 26 miles. Therefore, the first day was 26 - 22 = 4 miles.\n**5. Total Distance:**\n* Day 1: 4 miles\n* Day 2: 26 - 4 = 22 miles\n* Day 3: 12 miles\n* Day 4: 28 - 12 = 16 miles\n* Total: 4 + 22 + 12 + 16 = **54 miles**\n**Therefore, if we assume the error in the problem statement, the Rocky Path Trail was 54 miles long.** \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n* **Days 2 & 3:** Phoenix hiked 12 miles/day * 2 days = 24 miles.\n* **Days 1 & 3:** We know the total distance for these days was 22 miles. \n* **Day 3:** To find the distance for day 3, subtract the distance of day 1 from the total: 22 miles - (26 miles - distance of day 1) = distance of day 3.  \n* **Day 1:** Since we know the total distance for days 2 & 3 (24 miles), we can subtract this from the total for days 1 & 3 to find the distance for day 1: 22 miles - 24 miles = -2 miles. This tells us there's an error in the problem information, as you can't hike a negative distance. \n* **Day 4:** We need to determine the distance of Day 4. We know that the total distance for the last two days (Days 3 & 4) is 28 miles. We also know the combined distance of days 1 & 3 (22 miles) and the combined distance of days 2 & 3 (24 miles).  \n* **Total Distance:**  To find the total distance of the trail, we can add the distances for each day. However, the information given in the problem creates an inconsistency, meaning we can't determine the exact total distance of the trail. \n**Conclusion:** There seems to be an error in the information provided.  We can't accurately calculate the total distance of the trail without more consistent information. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n* **Day 2 & 3:** Phoenix hiked 12 miles/day * 2 days = 24 miles.\n* **Day 3 & 4:** Since the last two days were 28 miles, and Day 4 is part of that, Day 3 was 28 miles - Day 4's distance.\n* **Day 1 & 3:** We know Day 1 + Day 3 = 22 miles.\n* **Day 1:**  We know Day 1 + Day 2 = 26 miles. So, Day 1 = 26 miles - Day 2's distance.\n* **Day 4:**  Since Day 2 + Day 3 = 24 miles, and we know Day 2's distance, we can find Day 3's distance. Then we can subtract Day 3's distance from the total of Day 3 + Day 4 (28 miles) to find Day 4's distance. \n* **Total:** Add up the miles from each day to find the total trail length.\nLet's calculate:\n1. **Day 3:** Day 3 = 28 miles (Day 3 & 4) - Day 4's distance\n2. **Day 2:** Day 2 = 24 miles (Day 2 & 3) - Day 3's distance\n3. **Day 1:** Day 1 = 26 miles (Day 1 & 2) - Day 2's distance\n4. **Day 4:** Day 4 = 28 miles (Day 3 & 4) - Day 3's distance\nNow, let's plug in the numbers and solve:\n1. **Day 3:** Day 3 = 28 miles - Day 4's distance \n2. **Day 2:** Day 2 = 24 miles - Day 3's distance\n3. **Day 1:** Day 1 = 26 miles - Day 2's distance\n4. **Day 4:** Day 4 = 28 miles - Day 3's distance\nSince we have a bit of a circular reference, we'll need to work through it systematically. Let's start with finding Day 4's distance:\n* **Day 3 & 4:** 28 miles \n* **Day 1 & 3:** 22 miles\n* **Day 1 & 2:** 26 miles\nWe know Day 3 and Day 4 together are 28 miles.  We also know Day 1 and Day 3 are 22 miles.  This means Day 4 is 28 - 22 = 6 miles.\nNow, let's work backwards to find the rest:\n* **Day 3:** Day 3 = 28 miles (Day 3 & 4) - 6 miles (Day 4) = 22 miles\n* **Day 2:** Day 2 = 24 miles (Day 2 & 3) - 22 miles (Day 3) = 2 miles\n* **Day 1:** Day 1 = 26 miles (Day 1 & 2) - 2 miles (Day 2) = 24 miles\nFinally, let's add up the miles from each day to find the total trail length:\n* **Total:** 24 miles (Day 1) + 2 miles (Day 2) + 22 miles (Day 3) + 6 miles (Day 4) = **54 miles**\n**The Rocky Path Trail was 54 miles long.** \n",
        "Here's how to break down the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Calculate the total miles hiked on the second and third days:**\n* Since Phoenix averaged 12 miles per day for those two days, she hiked a total of 12 miles/day * 2 days = 24 miles.\n**2. Calculate the miles hiked on the third day:**\n* We know the total miles hiked on the second and third day was 24 miles. \n* We also know the total miles hiked on the first and third day was 22 miles. \n* To find the miles hiked on the third day, subtract the miles hiked on the first day from the total for the first and third days: 22 miles - 26 miles = -4 miles.  \n* Since we can't hike negative miles, we know there's an error in the problem setup. It's likely the information about the first and third day being 22 miles is incorrect.\n**3. Assuming the information about the first and third days is incorrect, we can proceed with the remaining information:**\n* We know the total miles hiked on the first and second days was 26 miles.\n* We know the total miles hiked on the second and third days was 24 miles.\n* We know the total miles hiked on the last two days was 28 miles.\n* To find the total distance of the trail, we need to add up the miles hiked on each day, avoiding double-counting any days. \n* The safest approach is to add the miles for the first and second days, the second and third days, and the last two days, then subtract the miles for the second day (which is counted twice): 26 miles + 24 miles + 28 miles - 24 miles = **54 miles**\n**Therefore, assuming the information about the first and third days is incorrect, the Rocky Path Trail is 54 miles long.** \n",
