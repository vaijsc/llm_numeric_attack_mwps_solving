        "1. **Cross-multiply:** To get rid of the fractions, we multiply both sides of the equation by $(x+1)$ and by $3$:\n   \n   $(x+2)(x+1) = 4 \\cdot 3$\n2. **Expand:**  Expand the left side of the equation:\n   $x^2 + 3x + 2 = 12$\n3. **Move all terms to one side:** Subtract 12 from both sides to set the equation equal to zero:\n   $x^2 + 3x - 10 = 0$\n4. **Factor:** Factor the quadratic expression:\n   $(x+5)(x-2) = 0$\n5. **Solve for x:**  For the product of two terms to be zero, at least one of them must be zero.  So, we have two possible solutions:\n   *  $x+5 = 0  \\Rightarrow x = -5$\n   *  $x-2 = 0  \\Rightarrow x = 2$\n6. **Check for extraneous solutions:**  We need to make sure that our solutions don't make the original denominators zero.  Notice that if $x=-1$, the denominator of the second fraction becomes zero, making the equation undefined.  Therefore, $x=-5$ is the only valid solution.\n**Answer:** The least value of $x$ that satisfies the equation is $\\boxed{-5}$. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n1. **Cross-multiply:** To get rid of the fractions, we multiply both sides of the equation by the denominators: \n   \n   (x + 2)(x + 1) = 3 * 4\n2. **Expand and simplify:**  Expand both sides and combine like terms:\n   x\u00b2 + 3x + 2 = 12\n   x\u00b2 + 3x - 10 = 0\n3. **Factor the quadratic:** Factor the quadratic expression:\n   (x + 5)(x - 2) = 0\n4. **Solve for x:**  Set each factor equal to zero and solve for x:\n   x + 5 = 0  or  x - 2 = 0\n   x = -5  or  x = 2\n5. **Determine the least value:**  We have two possible solutions: -5 and 2.
