    "solution": "Instead of expanding the entire product, we can look only at terms that will multiply to give $x^3$.  We know that $$x^3=x^3\\cdot 1=x^2\\cdot x=x\\cdot x^2=1\\cdot x^3.$$Knowing this, the $x^3$ term in the expansion will be the sum of these four terms: $$(6x^3)(4)+(4x^2)(3x)+(-7x)(3x^2)+(-5)(6x^3).$$We simplify to find: \\begin{align*}\n&(6x^3)(4)+(4x^2)(3x)+(-7x)(3x^2)+(-5)(6x^3)\\\\\n&\\qquad=24x^3+12x^3-21x^3-30x^3\\\\\n&\\qquad=\\boxed{-15}x^3\n\\end{align*}",
