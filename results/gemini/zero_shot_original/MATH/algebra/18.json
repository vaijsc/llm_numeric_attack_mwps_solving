    "problem": "Ten treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee. Two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig. The combined weight of how many treeks equals the weight of one squig?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let $t,s,g$ be the weight of one treek, the weight of one squig, and the weight of one goolee, respectively. Then the given information tells us \\begin{align*}\n10t &=3s+g\\\\\n2t +g &= s.\n\\end{align*} Since we would like to solve for $s$ in terms of $t$, we want to eliminate $g$. Add the two equations to obtain \\begin{align*}\n10t+2t+g &= 3s+g+s\\\\\n\\Rightarrow 10t+2t &= 3s+s\\\\\n\\Rightarrow 4s &= 12t\\\\\n\\Rightarrow s &=3t.\n\\end{align*} So one squig weighs $\\boxed{3}$ treeks.",

        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Set up equations:**\n* Let 'T' represent the weight of one treek.\n* Let 'S' represent the weight of one squig.\n* Let 'G' represent the weight of one goolee.\nWe are given the following information:\n* Equation 1: 10T = 3S + G \n* Equation 2: 2T + G = S\n**2. Solve for 'G' in terms of 'T' and 'S':**\n* From Equation 2, we get: G = S - 2T\n**3. Substitute the value of 'G' in Equation 1:**\n* 10T = 3S + (S - 2T)\n* 10T = 4S - 2T\n**4. Solve for 'S' in terms of 'T':**\n* 12T = 4S\n* S = 3T\n**5. Interpret the result:**\nThe equation S = 3T tells us that the weight of one squig is equal to the weight of three treeks.\n**Answer:** The combined weight of **three** treeks equals the weight of one squig. \n",
