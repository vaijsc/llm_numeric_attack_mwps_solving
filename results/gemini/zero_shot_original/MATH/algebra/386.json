    "solution": "We know that $(ax + b)^2 + c = (a^2)x^2 + (2ab)x + b^2 + c,$ meaning that if this to equal $x^2 - 8x - 49$, we start with $a^2 = 1,$ and so we let $a = 1.$ Then, $2ab = -8,$ so $b = -4.$ We do not need to find $c$ in this case, so our answer is $ab = \\boxed{-4}.$\n\nNote: Letting $a = -1$ gives us $(-x+4)^2 + c,$ which gives us the same answer.",
