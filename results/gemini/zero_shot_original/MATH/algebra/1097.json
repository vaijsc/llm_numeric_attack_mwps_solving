    "problem": "Robert wants to fence a rectangular plot of land of at least 500 square feet while using the least amount of fencing possible. He wants the width of the plot to be 5 ft longer than the length. What is the width of the plot?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We set the length to be $l$ and the width to $l+5$. We can write the problem as the inequality $l(l+5)\\ge500$. Distributing on the left-hand side, subtracting 500 from both sides, and factoring, we get \\begin{align*}\nl(l+5)&\\ge500 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\\nl^2+5l-500&\\ge 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\\n(l+25)(l-20)&\\ge 0.\n\\end{align*}The area is at least 500 square feet when the $l \\le -25 \\text{ or } l \\ge 20$. The dimensions can't be negative, so the smallest length possible while still having an area of at least 500 square ft is $20$ ft. Therefore, the width of the plot is $20+5=\\boxed{25 \\text{ ft}}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Define Variables:**\n* Let  'l' represent the length of the plot.\n* Let 'w' represent the width of the plot.\n**2. Set Up Equations:**\n* **Area:** We know the area must be at least 500 square feet:  l * w \u2265 500\n* **Width in terms of length:** We know the width is 5 feet longer than the length: w = l + 5\n**3. Substitute and Solve:**\n* Substitute the second equation (w = l + 5) into the first equation: l * (l + 5) \u2265 500\n* Expand the equation: l\u00b2 + 5l \u2265 500\n* Move all terms to one side: l\u00b2 + 5l - 500 \u2265 0\n* Factor the quadratic equation: (l + 25)(l - 20) \u2265 0\n* This inequality is true when l \u2264 -25 or l \u2265 20. Since length cannot be negative, we focus on l \u2265 20.\n**4. Determine the Width:**\n* Since the smallest possible length is 20 feet, we can find the width: w = l + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25 feet\n**Answer:** The width of the plot is **25 feet**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Define Variables:**\n* Let `l` represent the length of the plot.\n* Let `w` represent the width of the plot.\n**2. Set Up Equations:**\n* We know that the width is 5 feet longer than the length:  `w = l + 5`\n* We know the area must be at least 500 square feet: `l * w \u2265 500`\n**3. Substitute to Solve for Length:**\n* Substitute `l + 5` for `w` in the area equation: `l * (l + 5) \u2265 500`\n* Expand the equation: `l\u00b2 + 5l \u2265 500`\n* Move all terms to one side: `l\u00b2 + 5l - 500 \u2265 0`\n* Factor the quadratic equation: `(l + 25)(l - 20) \u2265 0`\n**4. Determine Possible Lengths:**\n* The equation is true when either `l + 25 \u2265 0` or `l - 20 \u2265 0`.\n* This means `l \u2265 -25` or `l \u2265 20`.  Since length cannot be negative, we discard `l \u2265 -25`.\n* Therefore, the length must be greater than or equal to 20 feet.\n**5. Find the Minimum Length:**\n* To use the least amount of fencing, we want the smallest possible length. \n* Since the length must be at least 20 feet, we'll use `l = 20` feet.\n**6. Calculate the Width:**\n* `w = l + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25` feet\n**Answer:** The width of the plot is **25 feet**. \n",
