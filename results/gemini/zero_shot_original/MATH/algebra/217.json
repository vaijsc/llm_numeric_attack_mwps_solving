        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n* **Simplify the left side:**  $(2^3)^4$ means we multiply 2 by itself 3 times, then take that result and multiply it by itself 4 times.  This is the same as 2 multiplied by itself a total of 12 times. So, $(2^3)^4 = 2^{3\\times 4} = 2^{12}$.\n* **Set the expressions equal:** Now we have the equation $2^{12} = 2^n$.\n* **Solve for n:** Since the bases are the same, the exponents must be equal. Therefore, $n = \\boxed{12}$. \n",
