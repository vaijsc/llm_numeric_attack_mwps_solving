        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Manipulate the equation:**\n* Multiply both sides of the equation by *x* to get rid of the fraction:\n   \n   ```\n   (2003/2004)x\u00b2 + x + 1 = 0\n   ```\n* Multiply both sides by 2004 to get rid of the fraction:\n   ```\n   2003x\u00b2 + 2004x + 2004 = 0 \n   ```\n**2. Identify the roots:**\n* Let the roots of the equation be *r* and *s*.  We know that the sum of the roots of a quadratic equation of the form *ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0* is given by  *-b/a* and the product of the roots is given by *c/a*.\n**3. Calculate the sum of the reciprocals:**\n* The sum of the reciprocals of the roots is:\n   ```\n   1/r + 1/s = (r + s) / (rs)\n   ```\n* Substitute the values of *r + s* and *rs* from the quadratic equation:\n   ```\n   (r + s) / (rs) = (-2004/2003) / (2004/2003) = **-1** \n   ```\n**Therefore, the sum of the reciprocals of the roots of the given equation is -1.** \n",

Manipulate the Equation**\n* Multiply both sides of the equation by  *x* to get rid of the fraction: \n   \n   ```\n   (2003/2004)x\u00b2 + x + 1 = 0 \n   ```\n**2. Use the Relationship between Roots and Coefficients**\n* For a quadratic equation of the form  *ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0*, the sum of the roots is  *-b/a*. \n* In our equation, *a = 2003/2004*, and *b = 1*. Therefore, the sum of the roots is:\n   ```\n   -b/a = -1 / (2003/2004) = -2004/2003\n   ```\n**3. Find the Sum of Reciprocals**\n* Let the roots of the equation be *r* and *s*.  We know:\n   *  *r + s = -2004/2003*\n* We want to find the sum of the reciprocals:\n   *  *1/r + 1/s = (r + s) / (rs)*\n* We need to find the product of the roots (*rs*). For a quadratic equation of the form  *ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0*, the product of the roots is  *c/a*.\n* In our equation, *c = 1* and *a = 2003/2004*. Therefore, the product of the roots is:\n   ```\n   rs = c/a = 1 / (2003/2004) = 2004/2003\n   ```\n**4. Calculate the Final Answer**\n* Now we can substitute the values we found into the expression for the sum of reciprocals:\n   ```\n   1/r + 1/s = (r + s) / (rs) = (-2004/2003) / (2004/2003) = **-1**\n   ```\n**Therefore, the sum of the reciprocals of the roots of the equation is -1.** \n",

Find the roots:**\n* Subtract 1 from both sides:\n   ```\n   (4007/2004)x = -1\n   ```\n* Multiply both sides by (2004/4007):\n   ```\n   x = -2004/4007 \n   ```\n**3. Find the reciprocals:**\n* The reciprocal of the root is:\n   ```\n   1/x = -4007/2004\n   ```\n**4. Calculate the sum of the reciprocals:**\n* Since there's only one root, the sum of the reciprocals is simply the reciprocal itself:\n   ```\n   -4007/2004\n   ```\n**Therefore, the sum of the reciprocals of the roots of the equation is  -4007/2004.** \n",
