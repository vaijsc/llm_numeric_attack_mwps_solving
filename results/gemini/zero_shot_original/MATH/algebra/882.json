    "solution": "Alice has a $1/2$ chance of winning the game on her first turn. If she doesn't, then the probability that she wins the game on her second turn is $1/8,$ since she must not win on her first flip ($1/2$ chance), Bob must not win on his first flip ($1/2$ chance), and then Alice must win on her second flip ($1/2$ chance). The probability that she wins the game on her third turn is $1/32,$ and in general, the probability that she wins the game on her $k^\\text{th}$ turn is $(1/2)^{2k-1}.$ Thus, the probability that Alice wins is an infinite geometric series with first term $1/2$ and common ratio $1/4.$ So, the probability that Alice wins the game is $$\\frac{\\frac12}{1-\\frac14} = \\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}.$$OR\n\nNote that the only difference between the odds of Alice or Bob winning is who goes first. Because Bob goes second, the odds of him winning on his $k^\\text{th}$ flip is half of the odds that Alice wins on her $k^\\text{th}$ flip, since Alice must first get a tails before Bob gets a chance to win. Thus, if $a$ is Alice's chance of winning, and $b$ is Bob's chance of winning, then $a = 2b.$ Also, since someone must win, $a + b = 1.$ It follows that $a = 2/3$ and $b = 1/3,$ so Alice has a $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$ chance of winning the game.",

        "Here's how to break down the probability of Alice winning:\n**1. Alice's First Turn**\n* Alice has a 1/2 chance of winning on her first turn by getting heads.\n**2. If Alice Doesn't Win on Her First Turn**\n* The game moves to Bob.  \n* Bob has a 1/2 chance of winning on his turn by getting tails. \n* If Bob doesn't win, the game goes back to Alice.\n**3. Alice's Second Turn (and beyond)**\n* This is where things get interesting.  The game has essentially reset to the beginning \u2013 Alice has another chance to win, and if she doesn't, it goes back to Bob, and so on.\n**4.  Recognizing the Pattern**\n* The game continues in this pattern: Alice's turn, Bob's turn, Alice's turn, and so on.  Each time the game goes back to Alice, it's like starting the game over again.\n**5.  Calculating the Probability**\n*  Let \"P\" represent the probability that Alice wins the game.\n* We can break down P into two parts:\n    * **The probability she wins on her first turn:** This is 1/2.\n    * **The probability she wins after Bob's turn:** This is the probability that she wins the game *after* it has gone back to her.  Since it's like a new game, this probability is also just P.\n    * To find the probability of winning after Bob's turn, we need to consider the probability she doesn't win on her first turn AND Bob doesn't win on his turn: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4. This means there's a 1/4 chance the game goes back to Alice.\n* Putting it all together: P = (1/2) + (1/4) * P\n* Solving for P:\n    * (3/4)P = 1/2\n    * P = (1/2) / (3/4)\n    * P = 2/3\n**Therefore, the probability that Alice wins the game is 2/3.** \n",
        "Here's how to break down the probability of Alice winning:\n**1. Alice's First Turn:**\n* Alice has a 1/2 chance of winning immediately by flipping heads.\n**2. If Alice Doesn't Win on the First Turn:**\n* The game moves to Bob.\n* Bob has a 1/2 chance of winning by flipping tails.\n* If Bob doesn't win, the game goes back to Alice.\n**3. Alice's Second Turn (and Beyond):**\n* This is where things get interesting.  Notice that if the game continues past Bob's first turn, it essentially resets back to Alice's first turn.  \n**4.  Putting It All Together:**\nTo calculate Alice's probability of winning, we can use a bit of a trick:\n* **Let 'P' be the probability of Alice winning the game.** \n* **Alice wins in one of two ways:**\n    * She wins on her first turn (probability 1/2)\n    * She *doesn't* win on her first turn, Bob *doesn't* win, and then she wins the game (probability (1/2) * (1/2) * P) \n* **So, the equation for Alice's probability of winning is:**\n    P = (1/2) + (1/2) * (1/2) * P\n**5. Solving for P:**\n* Simplify the equation: P = (1/2) + (1/4) * P\n* Subtract (1/4) * P from both sides: (3/4) * P = (1/2)\n* Multiply both sides by (4/3): P = (2/3)\n**Therefore, the probability of Alice winning the game is 2/3.** \n",
        "Here's how to break down the probability of Alice winning:\n**1. Alice's First Turn:**\n* **Probability of winning:** 1/2 (she needs heads)\n* **Probability of not winning:** 1/2 (she gets tails)\n**2. Bob's Turn (if Alice doesn't win on her first turn):**\n* **Probability of winning:** 1/2 (he needs tails)\n* **Probability of not winning:** 1/2 (he gets heads)\n**3. The Game Continues:**\n* If Bob doesn't win, the game goes back to Alice, and the pattern repeats.  This is essentially an infinite loop of turns.\n**Calculating the Probability**\nWe can use a geometric series to represent the probability of Alice winning:\n* **Alice wins on her first turn:** 1/2\n* **Alice wins on her third turn (after Bob's turn):** (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) \n* **Alice wins on her fifth turn:** (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2)\n* **And so on...**\nThis forms a geometric series where:\n* **First term (a):** 1/2\n* **Common ratio (r):** (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4\n**Formula for an Infinite Geometric Series:**\nThe sum (S) of an infinite geometric series is:  S = a / (1 - r)\n**Applying the Formula:**\n* S = (1/2) / (1 - 1/4)\n* S = (1/2) / (3/4)\n* S = 2/3\n**Therefore, the probability of Alice winning the game is 2/3.** \n",

Alice's Second Turn (and subsequent turns)**\n*  The game essentially restarts at this point. Alice has the same 1/2 chance of winning as she did on her first turn.\n**4.  The Pattern**\nThis pattern continues: Alice has a 1/2 chance of winning on each of her turns.  \n**5.  Calculating the Probability**\n* The probability of Alice winning is the sum of the probabilities of her winning on her first turn, her second turn, her third turn, and so on.\n* This forms an infinite geometric series: 1/2 + (1/2)^3 + (1/2)^5 + ...\n* The formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series is: a / (1 - r), where 'a' is the first term and 'r' is the common ratio.\n* In this case, a = 1/2 and r = (1/2)^2 = 1/4\n* Therefore, the probability of Alice winning is (1/2) / (1 - 1/4) = (1/2) / (3/4) = 2/3\n**Answer:** The probability of Alice winning the game is **2/3**. \n",

The Pattern**\n*  The game continues in a cyclical pattern: Alice's turn, Bob's turn, Alice's turn, etc.\n* Each time Alice gets another turn, it's like the game is restarting.\n**5.  Calculating the Probability**\nTo find the probability of Alice winning, we can use the following logic:\n* **Let 'p' be the probability of Alice winning.**\n* On her first turn, she has a 1/2 chance of winning.\n* If she doesn't win on the first turn (probability 1/2), the game restarts with Alice getting another turn. This means the probability of her winning from this point forward is still 'p'.\nTherefore, we can set up an equation:\np = (1/2) + (1/2) * p\nSolving for p:\n* p - (1/2)p = 1/2\n* (1/2)p = 1/2\n* p = 1\n**Conclusion:**\nThe probability of Alice winning the game is **1 (or 100%)**.  This might seem counterintuitive, but because the game essentially resets after each of Bob's turns, Alice is guaranteed to eventually win. \n"
