        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Expand the given form:**\n   The given form is  (Ax + 1)(Bx + 5).  Expanding this gives:\n   ABx\u00b2 + (5A + B)x + 5\n**2. Match coefficients:**\n   We want this expression to be equal to 6x\u00b2 + 17x + 5.  Matching coefficients, we get the following equations:\n   * AB = 6 \n   * 5A + B = 17\n**3. Solve for A and B:**\n   We need to find integer values for A and B that satisfy these equations.  Let's try different factors of 6:\n   * **If AB = 6, then:**\n      * A = 1, B = 6  doesn't work (5A + B = 11)\n      * A = 2, B = 3 works! (5A + B = 17)\n**4. Calculate AB:**\n   Since A = 2 and B = 3,  AB = 2 * 3 = **6**.\n**Therefore, the value of AB is 6.** \n",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Problem**\nWe need to find two binomials of the form  (Ax + 1) and (Bx + 5) that multiply to give us the quadratic expression 6x\u00b2 + 17x + 5.\n**2.  FOIL (First, Outer, Inner, Last)**\nExpanding the product (Ax + 1)(Bx + 5) using the FOIL method, we get:\n* **First:** (Ax)(Bx) = ABx\u00b2\n* **Outer:** (Ax)(5) = 5Ax\n* **Inner:** (1)(Bx) = Bx\n* **Last:** (1)(5) = 5\nCombining the terms: ABx\u00b2 + 5Ax + Bx + 5\n**3.

Solve for A and B**\nWe have two equations with two unknowns:\n* AB = 6\n* 5A + B = 17\nWe can solve for A and B by trial and error, using the factors of 6.\n* **If A = 1, B = 6:**  This doesn't satisfy 5A + B = 17 \n* **If A = 2, B = 3:** This satisfies both equations!\n**5.  Calculate AB**\nWe found that A = 2 and B = 3.  Therefore:\nAB = (2)(3) = **6** \n",
