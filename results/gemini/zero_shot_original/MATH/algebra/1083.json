        "Here's how to break down the problem and find the solution:\n**1. Start with the innermost function:**\n*  We have  `f(4)`. Since 4 is even, we use the second part of the definition:  `f(4) = 4^2 - 4(4) - 1 = 16 - 16 - 1 = -1`.\n**2. Work outwards, one step at a time:**\n*  Now we have `f(f(4)) = f(-1)`. Since -1 is odd, we use the first part of the definition: `f(-1) = (-1)^2 = 1`.\n*  Next, we have `f(f(f(4))) = f(f(-1)) = f(1)`. Since 1 is odd, we use the first part of the definition: `f(1) = 1^2 = 1`.\n*  We continue: `f(f(f(f(4)))) = f(f(1)) = f(1) = 1`.\n*  Finally, `f(f(f(f(f(4))))) = f(1) = 1`.\n**Therefore,  f(f(f(f(f(4))))) = 1.** \n",
