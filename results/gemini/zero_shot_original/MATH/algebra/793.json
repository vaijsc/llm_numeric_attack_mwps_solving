    "solution": "Let $x$ denote the number of hours Sphere has been growing. We can express this problem as an exponential equation, as follows: $$2^{x+6} = 2\\cdot 4^{x+1}.$$Now, since $4 = 2^2$, we have $2\\cdot 4^{x+1} = 2\\cdot (2^2)^{x+1} = 2\\cdot 2^{2x+2} = 2^{2x + 3}$, which means our equation is: $$2^{x + 6} = 2^{2x + 3}.$$Then, we set the exponents equal to each other, and obtain $$x + 6 = 2x + 3.$$Solving for $x$, we get $\\boxed{x = 3}$.",

        "Here's how we can solve this problem step by step:\n**1. Figure out how many hours Rod has been growing:**\n* Since Jane checks her farms at 8 p.m. and started Rod 5 hours earlier, Rod has been growing for 8 + 5 = 13 hours.\n**2. Calculate the population of Rod at 8 p.m.:**\n* Rod's population doubles every hour, so after 13 hours it has doubled 13 times. \n* This means Rod's population is 2 * 2^13 = 8192 bacteria.\n**3.  Determine how many times Sphere's population needs to quadruple to reach 8192:**\n* Since both farms have the same population at 8 p.m., Sphere also has 8192 bacteria.\n* Sphere starts with 8 bacteria, so it needs to quadruple by a factor of 8192 / 8 = 1024. \n* 1024 is 4^5 (since 4 * 4 * 4 * 4 * 4 = 1024).\n**4. Calculate how long Sphere has been growing:**\n* Sphere's population quadruples every hour, and it needs to quadruple 5 times to reach 8192 bacteria.\n* Therefore, Sphere has been growing for 5 hours.\n**Answer:** Jane started growing Sphere **5 hours ago**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Figure out the growth of Rod:**\n* Rod starts with 2 bacteria and doubles every hour.\n* Since Jane started Rod 5 hours before 8 p.m., it had been growing for 5 hours by 8 p.m.\n* In 5 hours, Rod's population doubled 5 times: 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 32 bacteria.\n**2.  Determine the growth of Sphere:**\n* At 8 p.m., Sphere has the same population as Rod, which is 32 bacteria.\n* Sphere's population quadruples every hour.\n* To get to 32 bacteria, Sphere needs to quadruple a few times. Let's figure out how many:\n    * 8 * 4 = 32  (Sphere quadrupled once to reach 32 bacteria)\n**3. Calculate the time Sphere has been growing:**\n* Since Sphere quadrupled once to reach 32 bacteria, it has been growing for 1 hour.\n**Answer:** Jane started growing Sphere **1 hour** ago. \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Figure out the growth rate of Rod:**\n* Rod's population doubles every hour, meaning it multiplies by 2 each hour.\n**2. Determine the population of Rod at 8 p.m.:**\n* Since Rod started growing 5 hours before Sphere, it has been growing for 5 hours longer.\n* Let's assume Rod grew for 'x' hours after Sphere started growing. This means Rod has been growing for a total of (x + 5) hours.\n* Rod's population at 8 p.m. is 2 * 2^(x + 5) (initial population * growth factor raised to the power of hours).\n**3. Determine the population of Sphere at 8 p.m.:**\n* Sphere's population quadrupled every hour, meaning it multiplies by 4 each hour.\n* Sphere has been growing for 'x' hours.\n* Sphere's population at 8 p.m. is 8 * 4^x (initial population * growth factor raised to the power of hours).\n**4. Set the populations equal to each other:**\n* Since the populations are the same at 8 p.m., we can set the two expressions equal:\n   2 * 2^(x + 5) = 8 * 4^x\n**5. Solve for 'x':**\n* Simplify the equation: 2^(x + 6) = 2^(3x)\n* Since the bases are the same, we can equate the exponents: x + 6 = 3x\n* Solving for 'x', we get: x = 3\n**6. Calculate how many hours ago Jane started Sphere:**\n* 'x' represents the number of hours Sphere has been growing.\n* Therefore, Jane started growing Sphere 3 hours ago.\n**Answer:** Jane started growing Sphere **3 hours** ago. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step by step:\n**1. Figure out how many times Rod's population doubled:**\n* Since Rod's population doubles every hour, and it started 5 hours before Sphere, it had 5 hours to double.\n* Rod's population doubled 5 times: 2 -> 4 -> 8 -> 16 -> 32 -> 64\n**2. Understand the relationship between Rod and Sphere's growth:**\n* At 8 p.m., Rod and Sphere have the same population. \n* Sphere's population quadruples every hour, which is the same as doubling twice.\n* This means that for every one hour of growth for Sphere, Rod needs two hours of growth to match.\n**3. Calculate how many hours Sphere has been growing:**\n* Rod's population is 64 at 8 p.m., which is 64/2 = 32 times larger than its starting population.\n* Since Rod doubles every hour, it took 5 hours to reach this population.\n* Because Sphere quadruples every hour, it only took 5 / 2 = 2.5 hours for Sphere to reach the same population.\n**4. Determine when Jane started growing Sphere:**\n* Jane checked the farms at 8 p.m. \n* Sphere has been growing for 2.5 hours.\n* Therefore, Jane started growing Sphere 8 p.m. - 2.5 hours = **5:30 p.m.**\n**Answer:** Jane started growing Sphere 2.5 hours ago, at 5:30 p.m. \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem:\n**1. Figure out how many times Rod's population doubled:**\n* Since Rod's population doubles every hour, we need to figure out how many times it doubled to reach the same population as Sphere at 8 p.m. \n* Since Sphere has a population 4 times larger than Rod at the start (8 vs. 2), Rod's population must have doubled twice to be equal.\n**2. Calculate how long Rod was growing before Sphere:**\n* Rod doubled its population twice, meaning it grew for 2 hours before Sphere started.\n**3. Determine the total time Rod was growing:**\n* Jane started growing Rod 5 hours before Sphere, and it grew for 2 hours before Sphere reached the same population.\n* This means Rod was growing for a total of 5 + 2 = 7 hours.\n**4. Calculate how many times Sphere's population quadrupled:**\n* Rod was growing for 7 hours, and Sphere was growing for 7 - 5 = 2 hours.\n* Since Sphere's population quadruples every hour, it quadrupled twice during those 2 hours.\n**5. Find the answer:**\n* Sphere was growing for 2 hours.\n**Therefore, Jane started growing Sphere 2 hours ago.** \n"
