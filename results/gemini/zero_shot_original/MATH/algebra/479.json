        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Arithmetic Progression Properties**\n* In an arithmetic progression, the average of the first and last term is equal to the average of any two terms that are equidistant from the ends.\n**2. Applying the Property**\n* Notice that the terms we want to sum (a\u2082 + a\u2084 + a\u2086 + ... + a\u2089\u2088) are all even-numbered terms.  We can pair them up like this:\n    * (a\u2082 + a\u2089\u2088)\n    * (a\u2084 + a\u2089\u2086)\n    * (a\u2086 + a\u2089\u2084)\n    * ...\n    * (a\u2089\u2088 + a\u2082) \n* Each pair has the same sum, which is equal to the sum of the first and last term: a\u2081 + a\u2089\u2088.\n**3.  Finding the Number of Pairs**\n* We have 49 even-numbered terms (a\u2082 through a\u2089\u2088), so there are 49/2 = 24.5 pairs. Since we can't have half a pair, we know there are **24** pairs.\n**4. The Sum**\n* The sum of the even-numbered terms is 24 times the sum of the first and last term: 24(a\u2081 + a\u2089\u2088) \n* Since the common difference is 1, we know a\u2089\u2088 = a\u2081 + 97.\n* Therefore, the sum is 24(a\u2081 + a\u2081 + 97) = 24(2a\u2081 + 97)\n**5. Using the Given Information**\n* We're given that a\u2081 + a\u2082 + ... + a\u2089\u2088 = 137. \n* The sum of the first and last term is: (a\u2081 + a\u2089\u2088) = 137 / 49 \n* So, the sum of the even-numbered terms is: 24 * (137 / 49) = **66.94** (approximately)\n**Therefore, the value of a\u2082 + a\u2084 + a\u2086 + a\u2088 + ... + a\u2089\u2088 is approximately 66.94.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand Arithmetic Progressions**\nAn arithmetic progression (AP) is a sequence of numbers where the difference between any two consecutive terms is constant. This constant difference is called the common difference.\n**2.  Express the Sum of an AP**\nThe sum of an arithmetic progression with the first term $a_1$, common difference $d$, and $n$ terms is given by:\n   $S_n = \\frac{n}{2} (2a_1 + (n-1)d)$\n**3. Apply the Information Given**\nWe know:\n*  $a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + ... + a_{98} = 137$  (This is the sum of the first 98 terms, so  $S_{98} = 137$)\n*  $d = 1$ (The common difference is 1)\n**4. Calculate the First Term ($a_1$)**\nSubstitute the values into the formula for the sum of an AP:\n   $137 = \\frac{98}{2} (2a_1 + (98-1)1)$\n   $137 = 49 (2a_1 + 97)$\n   $137 = 98a_1 + 4753$\n   $-4616 = 98a_1$\n   $a_1 = -47$\n**5.  Find the Desired Sum**\nWe want to find the sum:  $a_2 + a_4 + a_6 + ... + a_{98}$\nNotice that this is the sum of every other term in the arithmetic progression.  We can rewrite this as:\n  $(a_1 + 1) + (a_1 + 3) + (a_1 + 5) + ... + (a_1 + 97)$\nThis is the same as: \n  $49a_1 + (1 + 3 + 5 + ... + 97)$ \nThe sum of the odd numbers from 1 to 97 is the same as the sum of the first 49 odd numbers, which is $49^2$.  Therefore:\n  $49a_1 + 49^2$\nSubstituting $a_1 = -47$:\n  $49(-47) + 49^2 = -2303 + 2401 = \\boxed{98}$ \n",

Apply the Information Given**\nWe are given:\n* n = 98\n* d = 1\n* S = 137 \nWe need to find the sum of the even-numbered terms:  a\u2082 + a\u2084 + a\u2086 + ... + a\u2089\u2088\n**4. Manipulate the Sum**\nNotice that the sum of the even-numbered terms is the same as the sum of the odd-numbered terms.  Why?  Because the common difference is 1, so each even term is one more than the previous odd term.  This means:\na\u2082 + a\u2084 + a\u2086 + ... + a\u2089\u2088  =  (a\u2081 + a\u2083 + a\u2085 + ... + a\u2089\u2087)\nTherefore,  \na\u2082 + a\u2084 + a\u2086 + ... + a\u2089\u2088 = (1/2) * (a\u2081 + a\u2082 + a\u2083 + ... + a\u2089\u2088)\n**5. Solve for the Sum of Even Terms**\nWe know that the sum of all 98 terms (a\u2081 + a\u2082 + a\u2083 + ... + a\u2089\u2088) is 137.  So, \na\u2082 + a\u2084 + a\u2086 + ... + a\u2089\u2088 = (1/2) * 137 = **68.5**\n**Therefore, the value of a\u2082 + a\u2084 + a\u2086 + a\u2088 + ... + a\u2089\u2088 is 68.5** \n",

Applying the Formula to the Given Information**\nWe know:\n* S = 137 (sum of the series)\n* n = 98 (number of terms)\n* a = a\u2081 (first term)\n* l = a\u2089\u2088 (last term)\nSubstituting these values into the formula, we get:\n* 137 = (98/2) * (a\u2081 + a\u2089\u2088)\n* 137 = 49 * (a\u2081 + a\u2089\u2088)\n**3. Finding the Relationship between a\u2081 and a\u2089\u2088**\nSince the common difference is 1, each term is 1 more than the previous term.  Therefore:\n* a\u2082 = a\u2081 + 1\n* a\u2083 = a\u2081 + 2\n* ...\n* a\u2089\u2088 = a\u2081 + 97\n**4. Expressing the Desired Sum**\nWe want to find the value of:\n* a\u2082 + a\u2084 + a\u2086 + ... + a\u2089\u2088\nNotice that this sum consists of every other term in the original series.  Let's rewrite it using the relationship we found above:\n* a\u2082 + a\u2084 + a\u2086 + ... + a\u2089\u2088 = (a\u2081 + 1) + (a\u2081 + 3) + (a\u2081 + 5) + ... + (a\u2081 + 97)\n**5. Simplifying the Expression**\nWe can simplify the expression by combining the 'a\u2081' terms:\n* (a\u2081 + 1) + (a\u2081 + 3) + (a\u2081 + 5) + ... + (a\u2081 + 97) = 49a\u2081 + (1 + 3 + 5 + ... + 97)\n**6. Finding the Sum of the Odd Numbers**\nThe sum of the odd numbers from 1 to 97 can be found using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series (or by recognizing the pattern):\n* 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + 97 = (49/2) * (1 + 97) = 2401\n**7. Putting it All Together**\nNow we have:\n* a\u2082 + a\u2084 + a\u2086 + ... + a\u2089\u2088 = 49a\u2081 + 2401\nRecall that we found 137 = 49 * (a\u2081 + a\u2089\u2088).  Since a\u2089\u2088 = a\u2081 + 97, we can substitute to get:\n* 137 = 49 * (a\u2081 + a\u2081 + 97)\n* 137 = 98a\u2081 + 4703\n* -4566 = 98a\u2081\n* a\u2081 = -46.59 \nFinally, we can substitute the value of a\u2081 to find the desired sum:\n* a\u2082 + a\u2084 + a\u2086 + ... + a\u2089\u2088 = 49 * (-46.59) + 2401 = **-382.81** \n**Therefore, the value of  a\u2082 + a\u2084 + a\u2086 + ... + a\u2089\u2088 is -382.81.** \n",

Calculating the Sum of Odd Numbers**\nThe sum of the first 'n' odd numbers is equal to n\u00b2.  In our case, we have 49 odd numbers (1, 3, 5, ..., 97), so the sum is 49\u00b2.\n**8. Final Calculation**\nSubstituting the values of a_1 and d:\n49(-47) + (49\u00b2) * 1\n= -2303 + 2401\n= **98**\n**Therefore, the value of a_2 + a_4 + a_6 + a_8 + ... + a_98 is 98.** \n"
