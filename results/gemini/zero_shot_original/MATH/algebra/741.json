        "Here's how to solve this step-by-step:\n1. **Recall the slope-intercept form:** The equation of a line in slope-intercept form is  *y = mx + b*, where *m* is the slope and *b* is the y-intercept.\n2. **We know the slope:** We're given that the slope of the line is *m = 1/2*.\n3. **Use the point-slope form:**  We can use the point-slope form of a linear equation to find the equation of the line:  *y - y\u2081 = m(x - x\u2081)*.  Substitute the given point (2, -3) and the slope (1/2):\n   *y - (-3) = (1/2)(x - 2)*\n4. **Simplify the equation:** \n   *y + 3 = (1/2)x - 1*\n5. **Convert to slope-intercept form:**  Isolate *y* to get the equation in slope-intercept form:\n   *y = (1/2)x - 4*\n6. **Identify the y-intercept:** Now the equation is in slope-intercept form, and we can see that the y-intercept is *b = -4*.\n**Therefore, the y-coordinate of the y-intercept is -4.** \n",
