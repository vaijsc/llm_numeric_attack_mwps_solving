        "Here's how to determine the point farthest from the origin:\n**1. Understand Distance**\nThe distance of a point from the origin is calculated using the distance formula, which is derived from the Pythagorean theorem:\n*  Distance = \u221a[(x\u2082 - x\u2081)\u00b2 + (y\u2082 - y\u2081)\u00b2] \nIn this case, our origin (0, 0) will be (x\u2081, y\u2081), and each of the given points will be (x\u2082, y\u2082).\n**2. Calculate Distances**\nLet's calculate the distance of each point from the origin:\n* **(1, 4):**  \u221a[(1 - 0)\u00b2 + (4 - 0)\u00b2] = \u221a(1 + 16) = \u221a17 \n* **(3, 5):**  \u221a[(3 - 0)\u00b2 + (5 - 0)\u00b2] = \u221a(9 + 25) = \u221a34\n* **(-6, 0):** \u221a[(-6 - 0)\u00b2 + (0 - 0)\u00b2] = \u221a(36 + 0) = 6\n* **(-4, -2):** \u221a[(-4 - 0)\u00b2 + (-2 - 0)\u00b2] = \u221a(16 + 4) = \u221a20\n**3. Compare Distances**\nWe need to find the largest distance.  Comparing the calculated distances:\n* \u221a17 \u2248 4.12\n* \u221a34 \u2248 5.83\n* 6 \n* \u221a20 \u2248 4.47\n**Conclusion**\nThe point **(3, 5)** is the farthest from the origin because its distance (\u221a34) is the largest. \n",
