        "Here's how to solve the equation step-by-step:\n1. **Cross-multiply:** \n   Multiply both sides of the equation by the denominators to get rid of the fractions: \n   \n   ```\n   2x\u221a6 * \u221ax + 4\u221ax = x\u221a3 + \u221a2\n   ```\n2. **Simplify:**\n   * Distribute on the left side: \n      ```\n      2x\u221a6x + 4\u221ax = x\u221a3 + \u221a2\n      ```\n   * Simplify the radical terms:\n      ```\n      2x\u00b2\u221a6 + 4\u221ax = x\u221a3 + \u221a2\n      ```\n3. **Isolate the x terms:**\n   * Subtract x\u221a3 from both sides:\n      ```\n      2x\u00b2\u221a6 + 4\u221ax - x\u221a3 = \u221a2\n      ```\n   * Subtract 4\u221ax from both sides:\n      ```\n      2x\u00b2\u221a6 - x\u221a3 = \u221a2 - 4\u221ax\n      ```\n4. **Solve for x:**  At this point, the equation is quite complex and doesn't have a simple algebraic solution.  To find the value of x, we would need to use numerical methods (like graphing or using a calculator) to find the approximate solution. \n**Important Note:**  It's crucial to check any potential solutions you find back in the original equation to ensure they don't result in division by zero or any other invalid operations. \n",
