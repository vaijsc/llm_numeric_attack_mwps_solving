    "solution": "The first circle is centered at $(9,5)$ and has a radius of $\\sqrt{6.25} = 2.5$. The second circle is centered at $(-6,-3)$ and has a radius of $\\sqrt{49} = 7$. To find the shortest distance between the circles, we draw a segment connecting their centers, and subtract off the radii of the two circles. The distance between the centers of the circles is $\\sqrt{(9-(-6))^2 + (5-(-3))^2} = \\sqrt{15^2+8^2} = 17$. So the shortest distance between the circles is $17 - 2.5 - 7 = \\boxed{7.5}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Problem**\nWe have two circles. We want to find the shortest distance between their boundaries (the points on the circles that are closest to each other).\n**2. Visualize the Circles**\n* The first circle has center (9, 5) and radius \u221a6.25 = 2.5.\n* The second circle has center (-6, -3) and radius \u221a49 = 7.\n**3.  Find the Distance Between the Centers**\n*  The distance between the centers is found using the distance formula:\n   \u221a[(9 - (-6))^2 + (5 - (-3))^2] = \u221a(15^2 + 8^2) = \u221a289 = 17 \n**4.  Consider the Radii**\n* The shortest distance between the circles occurs when we draw a line segment connecting the centers and then subtract the radii.\n**5. Calculate the Shortest Distance**\n* Shortest distance = Distance between centers - Radius of larger circle - Radius of smaller circle\n* Shortest distance = 17 - 7 - 2.5 = 7.5\n**Answer:** The shortest distance between the circles is **7.5 units**. \n",
        "Here's how to find the shortest distance between the circles:\n**1. Understand the Concepts**\n* **Circles:**  The standard equation of a circle is (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2, where (h, k) is the center and r is the radius.\n* **Shortest Distance:** The shortest distance between two circles occurs along the line connecting their centers.\n**2.
