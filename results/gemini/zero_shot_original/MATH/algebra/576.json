    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We first isolate the square root, so we can then square both sides to get rid of it.  Subtracting 4 from both sides gives $x-4 = \\!\\sqrt{11-2x}$.  Squaring both sides gives $x^2 - 8x + 16 = 11-2x$, or $x^2 -6x + 5=0$.  Factoring gives $(x-5)(x-1)=0$, so $x=5$ or $x=1$.  Because we squared the equation, we must  check if our solutions are extraneous. For $x=5$, the equation reads $5 = \\!\\sqrt{11-10} + 4$, which is true. If $x=1$, we have $1 = \\!\\sqrt{11-2} + 4$, which is not true, so $x=1$ is extraneous. Therefore, our only solution is $\\boxed{x=5}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the equation step-by-step:\n1. **Isolate the radical:** Subtract 4 from both sides of the equation: \n   \n   ```\n   x - 4 = \u221a(11 - 2x) \n   ```\n2. **Square both sides:** Squaring both sides gets rid of the square root:\n   ```\n   (x - 4)\u00b2 = (\u221a(11 - 2x))\u00b2\n   ```\n   This simplifies to:\n   ```\n   x\u00b2 - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x \n   ```\n3. **Rearrange into a quadratic equation:** Move all terms to one side:\n   ```\n   x\u00b2 - 6x + 5 = 0 \n   ```\n4. **Factor the quadratic:**  Factor the equation:\n   ```\n   (x - 1)(x - 5) = 0\n   ```\n5. **Solve for x:** Set each factor equal to zero and solve:\n   ```\n   x - 1 = 0  or  x - 5 = 0\n   ```\n   This gives us two possible solutions:\n   ```\n   x = 1  or  x = 5\n   ```\n6. **Check for extraneous solutions:** We need to check if these solutions actually work in the original equation.  \n   * **For x = 1:** \n      *  \u221a(11 - 2(1)) + 4 = \u221a9 + 4 = 3 + 4 = 7.
