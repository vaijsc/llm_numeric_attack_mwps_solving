    "solution": "The slope of the line through $(7,8)$ and $(9,0)$ is $\\frac{8-0}{7-9}=\\frac{8}{-2}=-4$.  Thus, the line has equation $y=-4x+b$ for some $b$.  Since $B(9,0)$ lies on this line, we have $0=-4(9)+b $, so $b=36$.  Hence, the equation of the line is $y=-4x+36$, and the desired sum is $-4+36=\\boxed{32}$.",

Find the slope:**\n* The slope of a line passing through points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by: (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n* In this case, our points are (7, 8) and (9, 0).  Let's label them as follows:\n    * (x1, y1) = (7, 8)\n    * (x2, y2) = (9, 0)\n* Substitute these values into the slope formula:\n    * Slope = (0 - 8) / (9 - 7) = -8 / 2 = -4\n**2. Find the y-intercept:**\n* We can use the point-slope form of a linear equation: y - y1 = m(x - x1), where 'm' is the slope and (x1, y1) is a point on the line.\n* Let's use the point (7, 8) and the slope we found (-4):\n    * y - 8 = -4(x - 7)\n* Simplify this equation to find the slope-intercept form (y = mx + b):\n    * y - 8 = -4x + 28\n    * y = -4x + 36\n* The y-intercept is the constant term, which is **36**.\n**3. Find the sum:**\n* The slope is -4 and the y-intercept is 36.\n* Their sum is -4 + 36 = **32**\n**Therefore, the sum of the slope and y-intercept of the line is 32.** \n",
