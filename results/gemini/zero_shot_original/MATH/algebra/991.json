        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Properties of Consecutive Integers**\n* **Sum:** The sum of an arithmetic series (like consecutive integers) is the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms. \n* **Median:** The median of a consecutive set of integers is simply the middle term.\n**2. Set Up the Equation**\n* Let 'x' be the first of the 27 consecutive integers.\n* The sum of the 27 consecutive integers can be expressed as: x + (x + 1) + (x + 2) + ... + (x + 26)\n* We know this sum is equal to 3\u2077, so:  x + (x + 1) + (x + 2) + ... + (x + 26) = 3\u2077\n**3. Simplify the Equation**\n* Notice that we have 27 'x' terms in the sum.  We can rewrite the equation as: 27x + (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 26) = 3\u2077\n* The sum of the first 26 positive integers is (26 * 27) / 2 = 351.\n* Our equation now becomes: 27x + 351 = 3\u2077\n**4. Solve for x**\n* 3\u2077 = 2187\n* 27x + 351 = 2187\n* 27x = 1836\n* x = 68 \n**5. Find the Median**\n* Since we have 27 consecutive integers, the median is the 14th term (the middle one).\n* The 14th term is x + 13 = 68 + 13 = 81\n**Therefore, the median of the 27 consecutive positive integers is 81.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n* We have a sequence of 27 consecutive positive integers.\n* The sum of these integers is 3\u2077 (which is 2187).\n* We need to find the median of this sequence.\n**2. Properties of Arithmetic Sequences**\n* **Sum of an arithmetic sequence:** The sum (S) of an arithmetic sequence is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms (n).  \n   * S = n * (first term + last term) / 2\n* **Median of an arithmetic sequence:** The median of an arithmetic sequence is the middle term when the terms are arranged in order. \n**3. Applying the Properties**\n* **Let's represent the first term as 'x'.**  Since the terms are consecutive, the last term will be 'x + 26'.\n* **We know the sum (S) is 2187.** \n* **Using the sum formula:**  2187 = 27 * (x + (x + 26)) / 2\n**4. Solve for x**\n* Simplify the equation: 2187 = 27 * (2x + 26) / 2\n* Multiply both sides by 2: 4374 = 27 * (2x + 26)\n* Divide both sides by 27: 162 = 2x + 26\n* Subtract 26 from both sides: 136 = 2x\n* Divide both sides by 2: x = 68\n**5. Find the Median**\n* Since we have 27 consecutive integers, the median is the 14th term (the middle term).\n* The median is x + 13 = 68 + 13 = **81**\n**Therefore, the median of the 27 consecutive positive integers is 81.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n* **Consecutive integers:** These are numbers that follow each other in order (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4...).\n* **Sum:** We need to add up the 27 consecutive integers.\n* **Median:**  The median is the middle number when the numbers are arranged in order.\n**2. Use the Formula for the Sum of an Arithmetic Series**\nThe sum of an arithmetic series (like our consecutive integers) is:\n* **Sum = (n/2) * (first term + last term)** \n   where 'n' is the number of terms.\n**3.  Set Up an Equation**\n* We know the sum is  3\u2077 (which is 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 2187)\n* We know 'n' is 27 (since we have 27 consecutive integers)\n* Let 'x' represent the first integer in the series.\n* The last integer would then be 'x + 26'\nSo our equation is: 2187 = (27/2) * (x + (x + 26))\n**4. Solve for x**\n* Simplify the equation: 2187 = (27/2) * (2x + 26)\n* Multiply both sides by 2: 4374 = 27 * (2x + 26)\n* Distribute: 4374 = 54x + 702\n* Subtract 702 from both sides: 3672 = 54x\n* Divide both sides by 54: x = 68\n**5. Find the Median**\n* Since we have 27 consecutive integers, the median is the 14th number in the sequence (the middle one).\n* The 14th number is x + 13 = 68 + 13 = 81\n**Therefore, the median of the 27 consecutive positive integers is 81.** \n",

Set up an Equation**\nLet's call the first integer in the sequence \"x\".  The next 26 consecutive integers would be:\n* x + 1\n* x + 2\n* ...\n* x + 26\nThe sum of these integers is:\nx + (x + 1) + (x + 2) + ... + (x + 26) = 3^7\n**3. Simplify the Equation**\nWe can simplify this by combining the 'x' terms:\n27x + (1 + 2 + ... + 26) = 3^7\nThe sum of the numbers from 1 to 26 can be calculated using the formula (n(n+1))/2, where n = 26:\n27x + (26 * 27) / 2 = 3^7\n**4. Solve for x**\n* 27x + 351 = 2187\n* 27x = 1836\n* x = 68\n**5. Find the Median**\nSince we have 27 consecutive integers, the median is the 14th number in the sequence (the middle one).

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Arithmetic Series**\n* **Consecutive integers:**  These are numbers that follow each other in order (like 1, 2, 3, or 15, 16, 17).\n* **Arithmetic series:** A sequence of numbers where the difference between any two consecutive terms is constant.  In our case, the constant difference is 1 (since we're dealing with consecutive integers).\n**2. Formula for the Sum of an Arithmetic Series**\nThe sum (S) of an arithmetic series is: \nS = (n/2) * (a + l)\nwhere:\n* n = number of terms\n* a = first term\n* l = last term\n**3. Apply the Formula**\nWe know:\n* n = 27 (27 consecutive integers)\n* S = 3^7 (the sum is 3 to the power of 7)\nLet's call the first term 'a' and the last term 'l'.  We can express 'l' in terms of 'a':\n* l = a + 26 (since there are 27 terms, the last term is 26 more than the first)\nNow, plug these values into the formula:\n3^7 = (27/2) * (a + a + 26)\n**4. Solve for 'a'**\nSimplify and solve for 'a':\n* 3^7 = (27/2) * (2a + 26)\n* 3^7 * 2 = 27 * (2a + 26)\n* 3^7 * 2 / 27 = 2a + 26\n* 3^5 * 2 = 2a + 26\n* 3^5 * 2 - 26 = 2a\n* a = (3^5 * 2 - 26) / 2\n**5. Find the Median**\nThe median is the middle term in a sorted set.  Since we have 27 consecutive integers, the median is the 14th term (27/2 = 13.5, round up to 14).\n*  The 14th term is simply the first term ('a') plus 13 (since the terms increase by 1).\n*  Therefore, the median is (3^5 * 2 - 26) / 2 + 13.\n**6. Simplify**\n* Median = (3^5 * 2 - 26) / 2 + 13\n* Median = (243 * 2 - 26) / 2 + 13\n* Median = (486 - 26) / 2 + 13\n* Median = 460 / 2 + 13\n* **Median = 230 + 13 = 243**\n**Answer:** The median of the 27 consecutive positive integers is **243**. \n"
