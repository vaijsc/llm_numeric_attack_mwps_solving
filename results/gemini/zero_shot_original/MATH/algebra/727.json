    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Each even counting number, beginning with 2, is one more than the preceding odd counting number.  Therefore, the difference is $(1)(2003) = \\boxed{2003}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding the Patterns**\n* **Even Numbers:**  Even numbers are multiples of 2 (2, 4, 6, 8...).\n* **Odd Numbers:** Odd numbers are one more than a multiple of 2 (1, 3, 5, 7...).\n**The Key Insight**\nNotice that every even number is exactly one greater than the odd number that comes before it.  This means:\n* 2 = 1 + 1\n* 4 = 3 + 1\n* 6 = 5 + 1 \n* ...and so on\n**The Calculation**\nIf you add up the first 2003 even numbers and the first 2003 odd numbers, you'll be adding 2003 pairs of numbers where each even number is one greater than its corresponding odd number.  This means the difference will be:\n*  2003 * 1 = **2003**\n**Answer**\nThe difference between the sum of the first 2003 even counting numbers and the sum of the first 2003 odd counting numbers is **2003**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding the Patterns**\n* **Even numbers:**  The first 2003 even numbers are 2, 4, 6, 8,... 4006.\n* **Odd numbers:** The first 2003 odd numbers are 1, 3, 5, 7,... 4005.\n**Key Insight:**\nNotice that each even number is one greater than the corresponding odd number.  For example:\n* 2 is 1 greater than 1\n* 4 is 1 greater than 3\n* 6 is 1 greater than 5\n**The Difference**\nSince there are 2003 pairs of even and odd numbers, the difference between their sums will be:\n* 2003 * 1 = **2003**\n**Therefore, the difference between the sum of the first 2003 even counting numbers and the sum of the first 2003 odd counting numbers is 2003.** \n",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Patterns**\n* **Even numbers:**  2, 4, 6, 8...  Each even number is 2 more than the one before it.\n* **Odd numbers:** 1, 3, 5, 7... Each odd number is 2 more than the one before it.\n**2.  Pairing Up**\nNotice that if you pair up the first 2003 even numbers with the first 2003 odd numbers, you get pairs like this:\n* (2, 1)\n* (4, 3)\n* (6, 5)\n* ... and so on\n**3. The Difference**\nEach pair has a difference of 1 (the even number is always one more than the odd number). Since we have 2003 pairs, the total difference between the sum of the even numbers and the sum of the odd numbers will be:\n2003 pairs * 1 difference per pair = **2003**\n**Therefore, the difference between the sum of the first 2003 even counting numbers and the sum of the first 2003 odd counting numbers is 2003.** \n",
