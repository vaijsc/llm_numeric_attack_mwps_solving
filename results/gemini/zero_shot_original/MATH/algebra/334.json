        "Here's how to solve the equation:\n**1. Understand the Equation**\n* The equation involves a square root. We need to find a value of 'c' that makes the expression inside the square root equal to zero.\n**2. Solve for the Expression Inside the Square Root**\n* Set the expression inside the square root equal to zero: \n   4c - 5c\u00b2 = 0\n**3. Factor the Quadratic**\n* Factor out a 'c':\n   c(4 - 5c) = 0\n**4. Apply the Zero Product Property**\n* For the product of two terms to be zero, at least one of them must be zero.  Therefore:\n   *  c = 0 \n   *  4 - 5c = 0\n**5. Solve for 'c'**\n*  Solve the second equation:\n   *  4 - 5c = 0\n   *  -5c = -4\n   *  c = 4/5\n**6.  Verify the Solutions**\n* We found two possible solutions: c = 0 and c = 4/5.  Let's check if they satisfy the original equation:\n   * **For c = 0:**\n      * \u221a(4(0) - 5(0)\u00b2) = \u221a0 = 0  (This solution works!)\n   * **For c = 4/5:**\n      * \u221a(4(4/5) - 5(4/5)\u00b2) = \u221a(16/5 - 16/5) = \u221a0 = 0  (This solution also works!)\n**7.  The Answer**\nThe equation has two solutions: c = 0 and c = 4/5.  However, the question asks for a **nonzero** solution. Therefore, the answer is **c = 4/5**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the equation:\n**1. Square both sides:**\nSquaring both sides of the equation eliminates the square root:\n  (\u221a(4c - 5c\u00b2))\u00b2 = 0\u00b2 \n  4c - 5c\u00b2 = 0\n**2. Rearrange the equation:**\nRearrange the equation into standard quadratic form (ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0):\n  -5c\u00b2 + 4c = 0\n**3. Solve the quadratic equation:**\n* **Factoring:** We can factor out a common factor of 'c':\n   c(-5c + 4) = 0\n   This gives us two possible solutions: \n      * c = 0\n      * -5c + 4 = 0  =>  c = 4/5\n**4. Check for valid solutions:**\nWe need to check if these solutions satisfy the original equation,  \u221a(4c - 5c\u00b2) = 0:\n* **c = 0:**  \u221a(4(0) - 5(0)\u00b2) = \u221a0 = 0  (This is a valid solution)\n* **c = 4/5:**  \u221a(4(4/5) - 5(4/5)\u00b2) = \u221a(-4/5)  (This solution is not valid because we can't take the square root of a negative number)\n**Therefore, the only nonzero solution to the equation \u221a(4c - 5c\u00b2) = 0 is c = 0.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the equation:\n1. **Square both sides:** Squaring both sides of the equation eliminates the square root:\n   \n   (\u221a(4c - 5c\u00b2))\u00b2 = 0\u00b2\n   This simplifies to: 4c - 5c\u00b2 = 0\n2. **Factor out a c:** Notice that both terms have a common factor of 'c':\n   c(4 - 5c) = 0\n3. **Apply the Zero Product Property:** The Zero Product Property states that if the product of two factors is zero, at least one of the factors must be zero.  Therefore:\n    * c = 0 \n    * 4 - 5c = 0\n4. **Solve for c in the second equation:**\n   4 - 5c = 0\n   -5c = -4\n   c = 4/5\n5. **Check for validity:**  We need to make sure that the solutions we found work in the original equation. \n   * **For c = 0:** \u221a(4(0) - 5(0)\u00b2) = \u221a0 = 0. This solution works.\n   * **For c = 4/5:** \u221a(4(4/5) - 5(4/5)\u00b2) = \u221a(16/5 - 16/5) = \u221a0 = 0. This solution also works.\n**Therefore, the nonzero solution to the equation \u221a(4c - 5c\u00b2) = 0 is c = 4/5.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the equation:\n**1. Understand the Equation:**\n* The equation involves a square root. Remember that the square root of a number is only defined for non-negative numbers.\n* We're looking for a non-zero solution, meaning the value of 'c' should not be zero.\n**2. Solve for 'c':**\n* For the square root to be equal to zero, the expression inside the square root must be zero:\n   * 4c - 5c\u00b2 = 0\n**3. Factor the Equation:**\n* Factor out a 'c' from the equation:\n   * c(4 - 5c) = 0\n**4. Apply the Zero Product Property:**\n* The Zero Product Property states that if the product of two factors is zero, then at least one of the factors must be zero. \n* Therefore, either c = 0 or 4 - 5c = 0\n**5. Solve for 'c' in each case:**\n* **Case 1:** c = 0  (This is not a non-zero solution)\n* **Case 2:** 4 - 5c = 0 \n   *  -5c = -4\n   *  c = 4/5 \n**Conclusion:**\nThe only non-zero solution to the equation \u221a(4c - 5c\u00b2) = 0 is **c = 4/5**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the equation step-by-step:\n1. **Square both sides:** Squaring both sides of the equation gets rid of the square root:\n   \n   ```\n   (\u221a(4c - 5c\u00b2))\u00b2 = 0\u00b2\n   4c - 5c\u00b2 = 0 \n   ```\n2. **Rearrange into a quadratic equation:**  Move all terms to one side:\n   ```\n   5c\u00b2 - 4c = 0\n   ```\n3. **Factor the quadratic:**  Find two numbers that multiply to 20 (5 * 4) and add up to -4. The numbers -5 and 1 satisfy these conditions:\n   ```\n   (5c - 4)(c) = 0\n   ```\n4. **Solve for c:** For the product of two factors to equal zero, at least one of them must be zero.
