        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Rewrite the equation using the properties of logarithms:**\n* **Change of base:**  Recall that $\\log_a b = \\frac{\\log_c b}{\\log_c a}$ for any positive base $c$ (where $c \\neq 1$).  We can use this to rewrite the equation in terms of a more familiar base like base 10:\n   \n   ```\n   log_{3^2} (x-1)^2 = -1  =>  \\frac{\\log_{10} (x-1)^2}{\\log_{10} 3^2} = -1\n   ```\n* **Power rule:**  The power rule of logarithms states that $\\log_a b^n = n \\log_a b$.  Applying this, we get:\n   ```\n   \\frac{2 \\log_{10} (x-1)}{\\log_{10} 3^2} = -1\n   ```\n**2. Simplify and solve for x:**\n* **Simplify:**  Since $\\log_{10} 3^2 = 2 \\log_{10} 3$, the equation becomes:\n   ```\n   \\frac{2 \\log_{10} (x-1)}{2 \\log_{10} 3} = -1  =>  \\log_{10} (x-1) = -\\log_{10} 3\n   ```\n* **Combine logarithms:**  Using the property $\\log_a b - \\log_a c = \\log_a \\frac{b}{c}$, we can combine the logarithms:\n   ```\n   \\log_{10} \\left(\\frac{x-1}{3}\\right) = 0 \n   ```\n* **Exponential form:**  The equation $\\log_a b = c$ is equivalent to $a^c = b$.  Therefore:\n   ```\n   \\frac{x-1}{3} = 10^0 = 1\n   ```\n* **Solve for x:**\n   ```\n   x - 1 = 3\n   x = 4\n   ```\n**3. Check for extraneous solutions:**\nSince we're dealing with logarithms, it's essential to ensure that the argument of the logarithm is positive.  In our original equation, we have $\\log_{3^2} (x-1)^2$. This means that $(x-1)^2$ must be positive. Since any square is non-negative, this condition is automatically satisfied for $x=4$.\n**4. Find the sum:**\nWe found a single solution, $x = 4$.  Therefore, the sum of all values of $x$ is simply **4**. \n",
