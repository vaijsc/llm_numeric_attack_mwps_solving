        "Here's how to find the radius of the circle:\n**1. Complete the Square**\nTo find the radius, we need to rewrite the equation in standard form: $(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$, where (h,k) is the center of the circle and r is the radius.  We do this by completing the square for both the x and y terms:\n* **For x:**  Take half of the coefficient of the x term (8/2 = 4), square it (4^2 = 16), and add it to both sides of the equation: \n   x\u00b2 + 8x + 16 + y\u00b2 - 6y = 16 \n* **For y:** Take half of the coefficient of the y term (-6/2 = -3), square it (-3\u00b2 = 9), and add it to both sides:\n   x\u00b2 + 8x + 16 + y\u00b2 - 6y + 9 = 16 + 9\n**2.
