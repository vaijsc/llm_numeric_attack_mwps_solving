        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**Understanding Arithmetic Sequences**\nAn arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers where the difference between any two consecutive terms is constant. This constant difference is called the common difference.\n**Finding the Common Difference**\n1. **Identify the terms:** We have the first and third terms of the sequence: 3\u00b2 = 9 and 3\u2074 = 81.\n2. **Calculate the difference:** The difference between the third term and the first term is 81 - 9 = 72.\n3. **Find the common difference:** Since there are two terms between the first and third, the common difference is 72 / 2 = 36.\n**Finding the Missing Term**\n1. **Add the common difference:** To find the second term (which is *x*), add the common difference (36) to the first term (9). \n**Solution**\nTherefore, x = 9 + 36 = **45**. \n",

Understand Arithmetic Sequences**\nAn arithmetic sequence is a list of numbers where the difference between any two consecutive terms is constant. This constant difference is called the common difference.\n**2. Find the Common Difference**\n* The first term is  3\u00b2 = 9\n* The third term is 3\u2074 = 81\n*  To find the common difference, we can think of it like this:  9 + (common difference) + (common difference) = 81\n* Simplifying, we get 9 + 2*(common difference) = 81\n* Subtracting 9 from both sides: 2*(common difference) = 72\n* Dividing both sides by 2: (common difference) = 36\n**3. Find the Middle Term**\n* Since the common difference is 36, the middle term (x) is simply the first term plus the common difference: \n* x = 9 + 36 = 45\n**4. Answer**\nTherefore, the integer value of *x* is **45**. \n",
