        "Here's how to expand $(x + 5)^2$ step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the meaning of squaring:**\n   Squaring a term means multiplying it by itself. So, $(x + 5)^2$ is the same as $(x + 5)(x + 5)$.\n**2. Apply the distributive property (FOIL):**\n   * **F**irst:  x * x = x\u00b2\n   * **O**uter: x * 5 = 5x\n   * **I**nner: 5 * x = 5x\n   * **L**ast: 5 * 5 = 25\n**3. Combine like terms:**\n   x\u00b2 + 5x + 5x + 25  =  x\u00b2 + 10x + 25\n**Therefore, the expanded form of (x + 5)\u00b2 is x\u00b2 + 10x + 25.** \n",
