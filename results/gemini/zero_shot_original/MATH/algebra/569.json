    "solution": "In order to get rid of the cube root, we start by cubing the both sides of the equation \\begin{align*} (\\sqrt[3]{4x^2})^3&=(4)^3\n\\\\ \\Rightarrow \\qquad 4x^2& =64\n\\\\\\Rightarrow \\qquad x^2& =16\n\\end{align*}From here, we can see that the only possible values of $x$ are 4 and -4. Since the question asked to list them from least to greatest, the final answer is $\\boxed{-4, 4}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n1. **Cube both sides:** To get rid of the cube root, cube both sides of the equation:\n   \n   $(\\sqrt[3]{4x^2})^3 = 4^3$\n2. **Simplify:**  This gives us:\n   $4x^2 = 64$\n3. **Solve for x\u00b2:** Divide both sides by 4:\n   $x^2 = 16$\n4. **Take the square root:**  Take the square root of both sides, remembering that there are two possible solutions:\n   $x = \\pm 4$\n**Therefore, the possible values of x are -4 and 4. Listed from least to greatest, the solutions are:**\n* **-4**\n* **4** \n",
