        "Here's how to rationalize the denominator:\n**1. Multiply by 1 (in a clever way):**\nSince we want to get rid of the radical in the denominator, we'll multiply both the numerator and denominator by $\\sqrt{33}$:\n  *  \n  $\\frac{33}{\\sqrt{33}} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{33}}{\\sqrt{33}}$ \n**2.

        "1. **Multiply by 1:**  The key to rationalizing a denominator is to multiply by a form of 1 that will eliminate the radical in the denominator.  In this case, we multiply by $\\frac{\\sqrt{33}}{\\sqrt{33}}$:\n   $$\\frac{33}{\\sqrt{33}} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{33}}{\\sqrt{33}}$$\n2. **Simplify:**  Multiply the numerators and the denominators:\n   $$\\frac{33\\sqrt{33}}{33}$$\n3. **Cancel:** The 33 in the numerator and denominator cancel, leaving:\n   $$\\boxed{\\sqrt{33}}$$ \n"
