Therefore, the sum of the numerators in the 15th row is 15(16)/2 = 120.\n4. **Sum of the Fractions:**  Since all the fractions have the same denominator (16), we can find the sum of the fractions by dividing the sum of the numerators by the denominator: 120/16 = **15/2**.\n**Therefore, the sum of the fractions in the 15th row is 15/2.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1.

Finding the Fractions in Row 15**\nThe 15th row will have fractions with a denominator of 16, and the numerators will range from 1 to 15:\n1/16, 2/16, 3/16, ..., 14/16, 15/16\n**3. Summing the Fractions in Row 15**\nTo make the sum easier, we can simplify the fractions and pair them up:\n* (1/16 + 15/16) + (2/16 + 14/16) + (3/16 + 13/16) + ... + (7/16 + 9/16) + (8/16)\nEach pair sums to 1, and we have 7 pairs plus the fraction 8/16.

        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Understanding the Pattern:**\n* **Row 1:**  1/2\n* **Row 2:** 1/3, 2/3\n* **Row 3:** 1/4, 2/4, 3/4\n* **Row 4:** 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, 4/5\nNotice that each row consists of fractions with the denominator equal to one more than the row number.  The numerators increase from 1 to one less than the denominator.\n**2. The 15th Row:**\nThe 15th row will have 15 fractions: 1/16, 2/16, 3/16, ..., 14/16, 15/16.\n**3.  Simplifying the Fractions:**\nWhile we could add all the fractions in the 15th row directly, there's a clever shortcut.  Notice that each fraction in the row can be simplified:\n* 1/16 \n* 2/16 = 1/8\n* 3/16 \n* 4/16 = 1/4\n* ...\n* 14/16 = 7/8\n* 15/16\n**4.  Pairing the Fractions:**\nWe can pair the fractions in the row, creating pairs that add up to 1:\n* 1/16 + 15/16 = 1\n* 2/16 + 14/16 = 1\n* 3/16 + 13/16 = 1\n* ...\n* 7/16 + 9/16 = 1\nSince we have 15 fractions, there are 7 pairs that add to 1.\n**5.  The Remaining Fraction:**\nThe only fraction left over is 8/16, which simplifies to 1/2.\n**6. The Sum:**\nThe sum of the fractions in the 15th row is 7 (from the pairs) + 1/2 (from the remaining fraction) = **7 1/2**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Identify the Pattern**\nNotice that each row consists of fractions with the denominator being one more than the row number. Also, the numerators increase from 1 to the row number minus 1.\n**2.  The 15th Row**\nThe 15th row will have 15 fractions, and the denominator of each fraction will be 16.  The fractions in the 15th row will be:\n* 1/16\n* 2/16\n* 3/16\n* ...\n* 14/16\n**3.  Sum of an Arithmetic Series**\nThe fractions in the 15th row form an arithmetic series. To find the sum of an arithmetic series, we use the formula:\n* **Sum = (n/2) * (first term + last term)**\nwhere 'n' is the number of terms in the series.\n**4.  Calculation**\n* **n = 15** (number of fractions in the 15th row)\n* **First term = 1/16**\n* **Last term = 14/16**\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n* **Sum = (15/2) * (1/16 + 14/16)**\n* **Sum = (15/2) * (15/16)**\n* **Sum = 225/32**\n**Therefore, the sum of the fractions in the 15th row is 225/32.** \n"
