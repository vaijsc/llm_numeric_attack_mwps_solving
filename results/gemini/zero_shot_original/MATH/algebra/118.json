    "solution": "It seems easiest to first solve for $x$ and then for $y$. We can solve for $x$ by adding the two equations together, giving $2x = 16$, or $x = 8$. Plugging $x$ into the first equation gives $8 + y = 7$, so $y = -1$. So, $x\\cdot y = \\boxed{-8}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Solve for x and y**\n* **Add the equations together:** \n   (x + y) + (x - y) = 7 + 9\n   2x = 16\n   x = 8\n* **Substitute x = 8 into either of the original equations to solve for y:**\n   8 + y = 7\n   y = -1\n**2. Calculate the product of x and y**\n* x * y = 8 * (-1) = -8\n**Therefore, the product of x and y is -8.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Elimination Method:**\n* Notice that the 'y' terms have opposite signs in the two equations.  This makes them perfect for elimination. \n* Add the two equations together:\n   (x + y) + (x - y) = 7 + 9\n* This simplifies to:\n   2x = 16\n* Divide both sides by 2:\n   x = 8\n**2. Substitution:**\n* Now that we know x = 8, substitute this value into either of the original equations. Let's use the first equation:\n   8 + y = 7\n* Subtract 8 from both sides:\n   y = -1\n**3. Find the Product:**\n* We have found x = 8 and y = -1.\n* The product of x and y is:\n   x * y = 8 * (-1) = -8\n**Therefore, the product of x and y is -8.** \n",
