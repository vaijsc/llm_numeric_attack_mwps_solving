        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**Understanding the notation:**\n* **\u2308x\u2309 (Ceiling function):**  The smallest integer greater than or equal to x. \n* **\u230ax\u230b (Floor function):** The largest integer less than or equal to x.\n**Strategy:**\n1. **Represent x:**  Let's express x as the sum of its integer part and its fractional part:\n   *  x = n + f  \n     *  where n is the integer part of x (\u230ax\u230b)\n     *  and f is the fractional part of x (0 \u2264 f < 1)\n2. **Substitute:** Substitute this expression for x into the given equation:\n   *  \u2308n + f\u2309 + \u230an + f\u230b + (n + f) = 4.8\n3. **Simplify:**\n   *  n + 1 + n + (n + f) = 4.8  (Since \u2308n + f\u2309 = n + 1 and \u230an + f\u230b = n)\n4. **Solve for n:**\n   *  3n + f = 4.8 \n   *  3n = 4.8 - f \n5. **Analyze:** Notice that 3n must be an integer. Since f is a fraction between 0 and 1, (4.8 - f) will also be a fraction between 3.8 and 4.8.  The only integer that 3n can be within this range is 4.\n6. **Solve for f:**\n   *  3n = 4 \n   *  n = 4/3\n   *  Substitute n back into the equation 3n + f = 4.8\n   *  3(4/3) + f = 4.8\n   *  f = 0.8\n7. **Find x:**\n   *  x = n + f\n   *  x = 4/3 + 0.8 \n   *  x = **1.6**\n**Therefore, the solution to the equation is x = 1.6** \n",

Therefore, the maximum value of 3*n* + *d* is less than 3*n* + 1.\n   * Since 3*n* + *d* = 3.8, the only possible value for *n* is 1 (because 3*1 + 1 = 4).\n   * Substitute *n* = 1 back into the equation:\n      * 3(1) + *d* = 3.8\n      * *d* = 0.8\n5. **Find x:**\n   * We know that *x* = *n* + *d*, so:\n      * *x* = 1 + 0.8 \n      * **x = 1.8**\n**Therefore, the solution to the equation \u2308x\u2309 + \u230ax\u230b + x = 4.8 is x = 1.8.** \n",
