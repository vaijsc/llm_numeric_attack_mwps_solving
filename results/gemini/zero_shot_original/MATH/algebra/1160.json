        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Identify the Problem:**\nThe function is a rational function (a fraction where the numerator and denominator are polynomials).  Rational functions are not defined when the denominator is equal to zero.\n**2. Find the Values that Make the Denominator Zero:**\n* Set the denominator equal to zero:  x\u00b2 - 7x + 10 = 0\n* Factor the quadratic: (x - 2)(x - 5) = 0\n* Solve for x: x = 2 or x = 5\n**3. Answer:**\nThe function is not defined when x = 2 or x = 5.  Therefore, the function is not defined for **two** values of x. \n",
