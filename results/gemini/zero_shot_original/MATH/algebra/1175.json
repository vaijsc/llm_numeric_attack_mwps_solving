        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Define consecutive integers:**\nSince  *a* and *b* are consecutive integers and *a* < *b*, we can express them as:\n*  *a* = *x*\n*  *b* = *x* + 1 \n**2. Substitute into the equation:**\nSubstitute these expressions for *a* and *b* into the given equation:\n2(*x*) - 3(*x* + 1) = -23\n**3. Simplify and solve for x:**\n* 2*x* - 3*x* - 3 = -23\n* -*x* - 3 = -23\n* -*x* = -20\n* *x* = 20\n**4. Find the value of a:**\nSince *a* = *x*,  *a* = 20.\n**Therefore, the value of a is 20.** \n",
