        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n1. **Understand the operation:** The operation $\\clubsuit$ is defined as  $x \\clubsuit y = |x|^3 + y$. This means we take the absolute value of the first number, cube it, and then add the second number.\n2. **Substitute the values:** We're asked to find the value of $2 \\clubsuit 4$. So, we substitute $x = 2$ and $y = 4$ into the definition of the operation.\n3. **Calculate:**\n   *  $|2|^3 = 2^3 = 8$  (The absolute value of 2 is 2)\n   *  $8 + 4 = 12$\nTherefore, $2 \\clubsuit 4 = \\boxed{12}$. \n",
