        "Here's how to solve for *z* step-by-step:\n1. **Combine *z* terms:** \n   Add *3iz* to both sides of the equation: \n   \n   2 - 3iz + 3iz = 3 + 2iz + 3iz\n   \n   This simplifies to: 2 = 3 + 5iz\n2. **Isolate the *z* term:** \n   Subtract 3 from both sides: \n   2 - 3 = 3 + 5iz - 3\n   This gives us: -1 = 5iz\n3. **Solve for *z*:**\n   Divide both sides by 5*i*:\n   -1 / (5i) = 5iz / (5i)\n   Simplify:  -1 / (5i) = z\n4. **Rationalize the denominator:**\n   Multiply both the numerator and denominator by *i*:\n   (-1 * i) / (5i * i) = z\n   Simplify: -i / (-5) = z\n5. **Final result:**\n   Therefore,  *z* = i/5 \n",
