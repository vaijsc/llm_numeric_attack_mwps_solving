        "Here's how to find Ben's minimum height:\n**1. Understand the Problem:**\n* We're given a function that represents Ben's height as a function of time.\n* We need to find the minimum value of this function.\n**2. Recognize the Function Type:**\n* The function  $2t^2 - 5t + 29$ is a quadratic function.\n* Quadratic functions have a parabolic shape (U-shaped).\n* The minimum value of a parabola occurs at its vertex.\n**3. Find the Vertex:**\n* The x-coordinate of the vertex of a parabola in the form $at^2 + bt + c$ is given by:  $t = \\frac{-b}{2a}$ \n* In our case, $a = 2$ and $b = -5$.\n* Substitute these values into the formula:  $t = \\frac{-(-5)}{2(2)} = \\frac{5}{4}$\n**4. Find the Minimum Height:**\n* We've found the time when the minimum height occurs. To find the actual height, substitute $t = \\frac{5}{4}$ into the height function:\n   $2(\\frac{5}{4})^2 - 5(\\frac{5}{4}) + 29 = \\frac{25}{8} - \\frac{25}{4} + 29 = \\frac{199}{8}$\n**5. Round to the Nearest Foot:**\n*  $\\frac{199}{8} \\approx 24.875$  \n* Rounded to the nearest foot, Ben's minimum height is **25 feet**. \n",
        "Here's how to find Ben's minimum height:\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\n* We're given a function that represents Ben's height:  *h(t) = 2t\u00b2 - 5t + 29*\n* This is a quadratic function (shaped like a parabola). The minimum height corresponds to the vertex of the parabola.\n**2. Finding the Vertex**\n* The x-coordinate of the vertex of a parabola in the form *ax\u00b2 + bx + c* is given by: *x = -b / 2a*\n* In our case, *a = 2* and *b = -5*.  \n* So, the time (t) at which Ben reaches his minimum height is: *t = -(-5) / (2 * 2) = 5/4*\n**3. Calculating the Minimum Height**\n* Now that we know the time of the minimum height, we can substitute it back into the height function:\n* *h(5/4) = 2(5/4)\u00b2 - 5(5/4) + 29* \n* Simplify: *h(5/4) = 25/8 - 25/4 + 29 = 209/8*\n**4. Approximating to the Nearest Foot**\n* *209/8 \u2248 26.13* feet\n**Answer:** Ben's minimum height will be approximately **26 feet**. \n",
        "Here's how to find Ben's minimum height:\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\n* **The equation:** The height of Ben is represented by the quadratic equation  *h(t) = 2t\u00b2 - 5t + 29*. \n* **Minimum height:** We need to find the lowest point on this curve, which represents Ben's minimum height off the ground.\n**2. Finding the Minimum**\n* **Vertex:** The minimum (or maximum) point of a parabola (shaped by a quadratic equation) is called the vertex. We can find the *t*-coordinate of the vertex using the formula: \n   * *t = -b / 2a*, where *a* and *b* are the coefficients in the quadratic equation *at\u00b2 + bt + c*.\n* **Applying the formula:** In our equation *h(t) = 2t\u00b2 - 5t + 29*, we have *a = 2* and *b = -5*.  Let's plug them into the formula:\n   * *t = -(-5) / (2 * 2) = 5/4*\n**3. Finding the Minimum Height**\n* **Substitute to find h:** Now that we know the time (*t*) at which the minimum height occurs, we can substitute it back into the original equation to find the minimum height:\n   * *h(5/4) = 2(5/4)\u00b2 - 5(5/4) + 29* \n   * *h(5/4) = 25/8 - 25/4 + 29*\n   * *h(5/4) = 21.625*\n**4. Rounding to the Nearest Foot**\n* **Answer:** Ben's minimum height is approximately **22 feet** to the nearest foot. \n",
