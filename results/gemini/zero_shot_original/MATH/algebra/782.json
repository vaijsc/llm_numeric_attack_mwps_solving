        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Calculate the number of interest periods:**\n* There are 12 months in a year, so there are 12/2 = 6 bi-monthly periods in a year.\n* Over five years, there are 5 * 6 = 30 bi-monthly periods.\n**2. Calculate the growth factor:**\n* Each bi-monthly period, the investment increases by 1%, meaning it's multiplied by 1.01.\n**3. Calculate the final value:**\n* After 30 periods, the investment has been multiplied by 1.01 thirty times.  This is the same as 1.01^30.\n* The final value is then $24,000 * 1.01^30 \u2248 32,546.23$.\n**Answer:** To the nearest whole number, the total value of the investment after five years is **$32,546**. \n",

Calculate the growth factor for each bi-monthly period:**\n* A 1% increase means the investment is multiplied by 1 + 0.01 = 1.01 every two months.\n**3. Calculate the total value after 30 bi-monthly periods:**\n* The initial investment of $24,000 is multiplied by the growth factor 30 times: $24,000 * 1.01^30 \u2248 $31,827\n**Therefore, the total number of dollars in the investment after five years is approximately **$31,827**. \n",
