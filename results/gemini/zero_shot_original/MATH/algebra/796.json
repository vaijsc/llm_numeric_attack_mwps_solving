Find the Midpoint**\n* The midpoint of the diagonal connecting the two given vertices is also the center of the square. \n* The midpoint formula is:  ((x1 + x2)/2, (y1 + y2)/2)\n* Applying this to our points (7, 9) and (10, 2):\n   * Midpoint: ((7 + 10)/2, (9 + 2)/2) = (17/2, 11/2)\n**2. Determine the Side Length**\n* The distance between the two given vertices is the diagonal of the square.\n* Use the distance formula: \u221a((x2 - x1)\u00b2 + (y2 - y1)\u00b2)\n* Distance: \u221a((10 - 7)\u00b2 + (2 - 9)\u00b2) = \u221a(9 + 49) = \u221a58\n* Since the diagonal of a square is \u221a2 times the side length, the side length of the square is \u221a58 / \u221a2 = \u221a29.\n**3. Find the Other Vertices**\n*  The other two vertices lie on lines perpendicular to the given diagonal and passing through the center of the square.\n* We can use the slope of the diagonal to find the slopes of these perpendicular lines.\n* Slope of the diagonal: (2 - 9)/(10 - 7) = -7/3\n* Slopes of perpendicular lines: 3/7 and -3/7 \n* Using the point-slope form of a line (y - y1 = m(x - x1)) and the midpoint (17/2, 11/2) and the slopes 3/7 and -3/7, we can find the equations of the two lines containing the other two vertices.\n* Solving these equations (we'll omit the detailed steps here, but it involves solving systems of equations), we find the coordinates of the other two vertices:  (3, 14) and (14, -1).\n**4. Calculate the Sum of the y-coordinates**\n* The y-coordinates of the other two vertices are 14 and -1.\n* Their sum is 14 + (-1) = 13.\n**Therefore, the sum of the y-coordinates of the other two vertices is 13.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the midpoint:**\n* The midpoint of the diagonal connecting the two given vertices is the center of the square. \n* The midpoint formula is:  ((x\u2081 + x\u2082)/2, (y\u2081 + y\u2082)/2)\n* Applying this to our points (7,9) and (10,2), we get: ((7+10)/2, (9+2)/2) = (8.5, 5.5)\n**2. Determine the side length:**\n* The diagonal of a square is \u221a2 times the length of a side.\n* Find the distance between the two given vertices using the distance formula: \u221a((10-7)\u00b2 + (2-9)\u00b2) = \u221a(3\u00b2 + (-7)\u00b2) = \u221a58\n* Divide the diagonal length by \u221a2 to find the side length: \u221a58 / \u221a2 = \u221a29\n**3. Find the other two vertices:**\n*  The other two vertices lie on lines perpendicular to the diagonal, passing through the center (8.5, 5.5).\n* Since the sides of the square are \u221a29 units long, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the distance from the center to each vertex along these lines:  (\u221a29)\u00b2 = (\u221a29/2)\u00b2 + d\u00b2  =>  d\u00b2 = 29/4 => d = \u221a29/2 \n* The slopes of the lines connecting the center to the other vertices are the negative reciprocals of the slope of the diagonal: \n    *  Slope of the diagonal: (2-9)/(10-7) = -7/3\n    *  Slopes of the perpendicular lines: 3/7 and -3/7\n* Use the point-slope form (y - y\u2081 = m(x - x\u2081)) to find the equations of these lines:\n    * Line 1:  y - 5.5 = (3/7)(x - 8.5)\n    * Line 2:  y - 5.5 = (-3/7)(x - 8.5)\n**4. Find the y-coordinates of the other two vertices:**\n*  Since the side length is \u221a29, the other two vertices are \u221a29/2 units away from the center along these lines.\n* We can use the fact that the slopes of the lines are 3/7 and -3/7, and the distance is \u221a29/2 to find the coordinates.  \n    * For the line with slope 3/7, a change in x of 7/3 corresponds to a change in y of 1.  Since the distance is \u221a29/2, we need to find the change in x that corresponds to a change in y of \u221a29/2. This change in x will be (7/3) * (\u221a29/2).  Adding this change in x to the x-coordinate of the center (8.5) and using the slope to find the corresponding change in y, we get the coordinates of one vertex as (8.5 + (7/3)(\u221a29/2), 5.5 + (\u221a29/2)).\n    * For the line with slope -3/7, we follow a similar process. The change in x will be -(7/3) * (\u221a29/2).  Adding this change in x to the x-coordinate of the center (8.5) and using the slope to find the corresponding change in y, we get the coordinates of the other vertex as (8.5 - (7/3)(\u221a29/2), 5.5 - (\u221a29/2)).\n**5. Sum of the y-coordinates:**\n* The y-coordinates of the other two vertices are 5.5 + (\u221a29/2) and 5.5 - (\u221a29/2).\n* The sum of these y-coordinates is (5.5 + (\u221a29/2)) + (5.5 - (\u221a29/2)) = **11** \n",

Find the midpoint of the diagonal:**\n* The midpoint of a diagonal of a square is also the center of the square.\n* The midpoint formula is:  ((x1 + x2)/2, (y1 + y2)/2)\n* Using the given vertices: ((7 + 10)/2, (9 + 2)/2) = (8.5, 5.5)\n**2. Determine the side length of the square:**\n* The diagonal of a square is \u221a2 times the length of a side.\n* The distance formula calculates the length of the diagonal: \u221a((10-7)\u00b2 + (2-9)\u00b2) = \u221a(9 + 49) = \u221a58\n* Side length of the square: \u221a58 / \u221a2 = \u221a29\n**3. Find the coordinates of the other two vertices:**\n* Since the center of the square is (8.5, 5.5) and the side length is \u221a29, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the y-coordinates of the other two vertices.  \n* We know the distance from the center to a vertex is half the diagonal, which is \u221a29/2.\n* Consider the vertex to the right of the center (8.5, 5.5).  Its x-coordinate will be 8.5 + \u221a29/2.  To find its y-coordinate, we use the Pythagorean theorem: (\u221a29/2)\u00b2 + (y - 5.5)\u00b2 = (\u221a29/2)\u00b2.\n* Solving for y, we get y = 5.5. \n* The vertex to the left of the center will have the same y-coordinate.\n**4. Calculate the sum of the y-coordinates:**\n* The y-coordinates of the other two vertices are both 5.5.\n* The sum is 5.5 + 5.5 = **11** \n",

Find the Midpoint**\n* The midpoint of a diagonal of a square is also the center of the square.\n*  The midpoint formula is:  ((x1 + x2)/2, (y1 + y2)/2)\n*  Midpoint of (7, 9) and (10, 2):  ((7 + 10)/2, (9 + 2)/2) = (17/2, 11/2)\n**2.  Understand the Geometry**\n* The sides of the square are perpendicular to the diagonal.\n*  The distance from a vertex to the center of the square is half the length of the diagonal. \n**3. Find the Slope of the Diagonal**\n* The slope of a line is (change in y) / (change in x)\n*  Slope of the diagonal: (2 - 9) / (10 - 7) = -7/3\n**4. Find the Slope of a Side**\n* Perpendicular lines have slopes that are negative reciprocals of each other.\n* The slope of a side of the square is 3/7.\n**5.  Find the Other Vertices**\n*  We know the midpoint (17/2, 11/2) and the slope of a side (3/7). \n*  Let's find one of the other vertices.  Let's say it's (x, y).\n*  Using the slope formula: (y - 11/2) / (x - 17/2) = 3/7\n*  We also know that the distance from the midpoint to this vertex is half the length of the diagonal.  We can use the distance formula to find the distance between the midpoint and a vertex. \n**6.  Solve for x and y**\n* We have two equations and two unknowns, so we can solve for x and y.\n*  Solving the system of equations, we find two possible vertices: (10, 9) and (7, 2).\n**7.  Find the Sum of the y-coordinates**\n* The sum of the y-coordinates of the other two vertices is 9 + 2 = **11**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the midpoint of the diagonal:**\n* The midpoint of a line segment is found by averaging the x-coordinates and averaging the y-coordinates. \n* Midpoint:  ((7 + 10)/2, (9 + 2)/2) = (17/2, 11/2)\n**2. Understand the geometry:**\n* The midpoint of a square's diagonal is also the center of the square.\n* The diagonals of a square are perpendicular bisectors of each other.\n**3. Determine the slope of the diagonal:**\n* Slope = (change in y) / (change in x) = (2 - 9) / (10 - 7) = -7/3\n**4. Find the slope of the other diagonal:**\n* Since the diagonals are perpendicular, the slope of the other diagonal is the negative reciprocal of -7/3.  This is 3/7.\n**5. Use the midpoint and slope to find the other vertices:**\n* Let's call the unknown y-coordinate of one of the other vertices 'y'.  We know its x-coordinate is 17/2 (the midpoint's x-coordinate).\n* Using the slope of 3/7 and the midpoint (17/2, 11/2), we can set up the following equation:\n   * (y - 11/2) / (17/2 - 17/2) = 3/7 \n   * Since the denominator on the left side is zero, this equation is not solvable.  This means our approach of using the slope to find the other vertices won't work directly.\n**6.  Consider the symmetry:**\n*  Since the diagonals of a square are perpendicular bisectors, the other two vertices are the same distance from the midpoint as the given vertices.\n*  Let's look at the x-coordinates: the given vertices have x-coordinates 7 and 10.  The midpoint is at 17/2.  The other two vertices must have x-coordinates that are the same distance from 17/2 as 7 and 10.\n*  This means the x-coordinates of the other vertices are (17/2 - 7) = 3/2 and (17/2 - 10) = -3/2.\n**7.  Find the y-coordinates:**\n* We know the y-coordinate of the midpoint is 11/2.\n* Since the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors, the y-coordinates of the other two vertices will be the same distance from 11/2 as the y-coordinates of the given vertices (9 and 2).\n* Therefore, the y-coordinates of the other vertices are (11/2 - 9) = -7/2 and (11/2 - 2) = 7/2.\n**8. Calculate the sum:**\n* The sum of the y-coordinates of the other two vertices is (-7/2) + (7/2) = **0**. \n"
