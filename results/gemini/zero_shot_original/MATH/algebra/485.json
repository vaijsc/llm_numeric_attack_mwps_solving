    "problem": "Kim has exactly enough money to buy 40 oranges at $3x$ cents each. If the price rose to $4x$ cents per orange, how many oranges could she buy?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "If the total cost is fixed, then the relationship between cost per item and the number of items is inversely proportional.  Since each orange costs $\\frac{4}{3}$ as much, the same amount of money purchases $\\frac{3}{4}$ as many of them.  Taking three-fourths of 40, we find that Kim could buy $\\boxed{30}$ oranges.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the total amount of money Kim has:**\n* Cost of one orange: $3x$ cents\n* Number of oranges: 40\n* Total money: (3x cents/orange) * 40 oranges = 120x cents\n**2. Calculate how many oranges Kim can buy at the new price:**\n* New price per orange: $4x$ cents\n* Total money: 120x cents\n* Number of oranges Kim can buy: (120x cents) / (4x cents/orange) = 30 oranges\n**Answer:** Kim could buy **30** oranges at the new price. \n",
