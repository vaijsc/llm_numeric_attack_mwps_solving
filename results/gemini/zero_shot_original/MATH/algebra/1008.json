    "solution": "We can split the expression $|5x-1|=x+3$ into two separate cases. In the first case, \\begin{align*} 5x-1&=x+3\n\\\\\\Rightarrow \\qquad 4x&=4\n\\\\\\Rightarrow \\qquad x&=1\n\\end{align*}If we plug this value of $x$ back into the original equation in order to check our answer, we see that $|5(1)-1|=1+3$ or $4=4$. Since this is true, we can accept $x=1$ as a valid solution.\n\nIn the second case, \\begin{align*} 5x-1&=-(x+3)\n\\\\ 5x-1&=-x-3\n\\\\\\Rightarrow \\qquad 6x&=-2\n\\\\\\Rightarrow \\qquad x&=-\\frac13.\n\\end{align*}If we plug $-\\frac13$ back into the initial equation, we get that $\\left|5\\left(-\\frac13\\right)-1\\right|=-\\frac13+3$, which simplifies to $\\left|-\\frac{8}{3}\\right|=\\frac{8}{3}$, or $\\frac{8}{3}=\\frac{8}{3}$. Since this is also a true statement, we can accept $x=-\\frac13$ as a valid solution as well. Since both $x=1$ and $x=-\\frac13$ are possible values of $x$, the final answer is the larger of the two: $x=\\boxed{1}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand Absolute Value**\nThe absolute value of a number is its distance from zero.  This means:\n*  If the expression inside the absolute value bars is positive, it stays the same.\n*  If the expression inside the absolute value bars is negative, we take its opposite.\n**2. Split the Equation**\nBecause of the absolute value, we need to consider two cases:\n* **Case 1:**  5x - 1 is positive or zero\n   *  This means 5x - 1 \u2265 0, so x \u2265 1/5.\n   *  The equation becomes: 5x - 1 = x + 3 \n* **Case 2:**  5x - 1 is negative\n   *  This means 5x - 1 < 0, so x < 1/5.\n   *  The equation becomes: -(5x - 1) = x + 3 \n**3. Solve Each Case**\n* **Case 1:** \n   * 5x - 1 = x + 3\n   * 4x = 4\n   * x = 1\n* **Case 2:**\n   * -5x + 1 = x + 3\n   * -6x = 2\n   * x = -1/3\n**4.

The larger of these two values is **x = 1**. \n**Therefore, the largest value of x that satisfies the equation is x = 1.** \n",
        "### Step 1: Understand Absolute Value\nThe absolute value of a number is its distance from zero.

Solving for $x$, we get: \n* $4x = 4$\n* $x = 1$\n**Case 2: $x < \\frac{1}{5}$**\nThe equation becomes: $-(5x-1) = x+3$. Solving for $x$, we get:\n* $-5x + 1 = x + 3$\n* $-6x = 2$\n* $x = -\\frac{1}{3}$\n### Step 3: Determine the largest solution\nWe have found two potential solutions: $x=1$ and $x = -\\frac{1}{3}$.
