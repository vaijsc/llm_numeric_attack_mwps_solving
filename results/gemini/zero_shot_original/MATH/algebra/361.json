        "Here's how to solve this:\n* **Figure out the ratio:** Each meal provides enough food for 18 people / 12 meals = 1.5 people per meal.\n* **Calculate the meals needed:** 12 people / 1.5 people per meal = 8 meals.\n**Answer:** They should have ordered 8 meals to have just enough food for the 12 of them. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n* **The problem:**  They ordered enough food for 18 people, but only 12 are eating.\n* **Find the ratio:**  The ratio of food to people is 18:12.\n* **Simplify the ratio:** This ratio can be simplified by dividing both sides by 6, giving us 3:2.\n* **The answer:** This means they need to order 2 meals for every 3 people. Since they have 12 people, they should have ordered 8 meals (12 people / 3 people per 2 meals = 4 sets of 2 meals). \n**Therefore, they should have ordered 8 meals to have just enough food for 12 people.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n* **Figure out the ratio:**  The food at Oscar's is enough for 18 people, but they only have 12. This means they have 18/12 = 1.5 times more food than they need.\n* **Divide to find the right amount:** Since they have 1.5 times more food than needed, they should have ordered 12 people / 1.5 = **8 meals**.\n**Therefore, they should have ordered 8 meals to have just enough food for the 12 of them.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n* **Figure out the ratio:** Each meal provides enough food for 18 people / 12 friends = 1.5 people.\n* **Calculate the needed meals:** To have enough for 12 people, divide the total people by the food-per-meal ratio: 12 people / 1.5 people/meal = 8 meals.\n**Answer:** They should have ordered 8 meals. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n* **Figure out the ratio:** The food from one meal is enough for 18/12 = 1.5 people.\n* **Calculate the meals needed:** To feed 12 people, they would need 12 / 1.5 = 8 meals.\n**Answer:** They should have ordered 8 meals to have just enough food for the 12 of them. \n"
