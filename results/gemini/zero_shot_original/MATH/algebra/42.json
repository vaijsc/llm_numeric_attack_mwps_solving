        "Here's how to solve the problem step by step:\n**1. Understand Absolute Value**\nThe absolute value of a number is its distance from zero. So,  |x - 1| represents the distance between the number *x* and the number 1.\n**2. Set Up Two Equations**\nSince the distance can be either positive or negative, we need to consider two cases:\n* **Case 1:** x - 1 = 7\n* **Case 2:** x - 1 = -7\n**3. Solve for x in Each Case**\n* **Case 1:** \n   x - 1 = 7\n   x = 7 + 1\n   x = 8\n* **Case 2:**\n   x - 1 = -7\n   x = -7 + 1\n   x = -6\n**4. Find the Sum**\nThe solutions are x = 8 and x = -6.  Their sum is:\n8 + (-6) = **2**\n**Therefore, the sum of all values of x that satisfy the equation |x - 1| = 7 is 2.** \n",
