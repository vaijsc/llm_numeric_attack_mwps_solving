    "solution": "With word problems, the first step is to translate the words into equations. Let the two numbers be $a$ and $b$. Then their sum is $a+b$ and their product is $ab$. The sum of their product and their sum is $a+b+ab$. So we know  \\begin{align*}\nab+a+b&=454\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\na(b+1)+(b+1)&=454+1\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n(a+1)(b+1)&=455.\n\\end{align*}The prime factorization of $455$ is $5\\cdot 7\\cdot 13$. Since the equation is symmetric with $a$ and $b$, we may (without loss of generality) suppose that $a<b$. Thus $a+1<b+1$, so in each factor pair the smaller factor is equal to $a+1$. We list all possibilities: \\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c}\n$a+1$&$b+1$&$a$&$b$\\\\ \\hline\n$1$&$455$&$0$&$454$\\\\\n$5$&$91$&$4$&$90$\\\\\n$7$&$65$&$6$&$64$\\\\\n$13$&$35$&$12$&$34$\n\\end{tabular}We must find the largest possible value of \"the product of their sum and their product\", or $ab\\cdot(a+b)$. We know the first possibility above gives a value of zero, while all the others will be greater than zero. We check: \\begin{align*}\n4\\cdot 90\\cdot (4+90)&=4\\cdot 90\\cdot 94=33840\\\\\n6\\cdot 64\\cdot (6+64)&=6\\cdot 64\\cdot 70=26880\\\\\n12\\cdot 34\\cdot (12+34)&=12\\cdot 34\\cdot 46=18768.\n\\end{align*}Thus the largest possible desired value is $\\boxed{33840}$, achieved when $(a,b)=(4,90)$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Set up the equations:**\n* Let the two positive integers be  *x* and *y*.\n* We are given:  *xy + x + y = 454* \n**2. Manipulate the equation to find a relationship between the sum and product:**\n* Add 1 to both sides of the equation: \n   *xy + x + y + 1 = 455*\n* Factor the left side:\n   *(x + 1)(y + 1) = 455*\n**3. Express the desired quantity in terms of x and y:**\n* We want to maximize:  (x + y)(xy) \n**4. Use AM-GM inequality:**\n* The Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality states that for non-negative numbers, the arithmetic mean is always greater than or equal to the geometric mean. In our case:\n    * [(x + 1) + (y + 1)] / 2 \u2265 \u221a[(x + 1)(y + 1)]\n    * (x + y + 2) / 2 \u2265 \u221a455 \n**5. Simplify and solve for x + y:**\n* Square both sides: (x + y + 2)\u00b2 / 4 \u2265 455\n* Multiply both sides by 4: (x + y + 2)\u00b2 \u2265 1820\n* Take the square root of both sides: x + y + 2 \u2265 \u221a1820 \n* Subtract 2 from both sides: x + y \u2265 \u221a1820 - 2\n**6. Maximize the product (x + y)(xy):**\n* We know that (x + y) is minimized when x + y = \u221a1820 - 2.  To maximize the product (x + y)(xy), we want to maximize *xy*. \n* From the equation (x + 1)(y + 1) = 455, we see that *xy* is maximized when *x + 1* and *y + 1* are as close together as possible.  This means that *x* and *y* should be as close as possible.\n**7. Find the closest integers to satisfy the equation:**\n* Since 455 is close to 21\u00b2 (441), we can try x + 1 = 21 and y + 1 = 22. This gives us x = 20 and y = 21.\n* Checking: (20)(21) + 20 + 21 = 454.  This solution works!\n**8. Calculate the maximum product:**\n* (x + y)(xy) = (20 + 21)(20)(21) = 41 * 420 = **17220**\n**Therefore, the largest possible value of the product of their sum and their product is 17220.** \n",

Set up equations:**\n* Let the two positive integers be *x* and *y*.\n* We are given that the sum of their product and their sum is 454:  *xy + x + y = 454*\n**2.  Complete the square:**\n* To find the maximum value, we'll use the technique of completing the square.  \n* Rearrange the equation: *xy + x + y + 1 = 455*\n* Factor the left side: *(x + 1)(y + 1) = 455*\n**3. Factorize 455:**\n* Find the prime factorization of 455: *455 = 5 x 7 x 13*\n**4. Maximize the product:**\n* We want to maximize the product *(x + 1)(y + 1)*.  \n* Since *x* and *y* are positive integers, *x + 1* and *y + 1* are also positive integers.\n* To maximize the product, we need to choose the largest possible values for *x + 1* and *y + 1*.  \n* This means we should set:\n   * *x + 1 = 7 x 13 = 91*\n   * *y + 1 = 5*\n**5. Solve for x and y:**\n* *x = 90*\n* *y = 4*\n**6. Calculate the desired product:**\n* The sum of *x* and *y* is *90 + 4 = 94*.\n* The product of *x* and *y* is *90 x 4 = 360*.\n* The product of their sum and their product is *94 x 360 = **33840***.\n**Therefore, the largest possible value of the product of the sum and the product of the two integers is 33840.** \n",
        "Let the two positive integers be $x$ and $y$.  We are given that $xy + x + y = 454$.  Adding 1 to both sides, we get\n\\[xy + x + y + 1 = 455.\\]The left-hand side factors as $(x + 1)(y + 1)$, so $(x + 1)(y + 1) = 455$.

        "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Define Variables:**\n* Let the two positive integers be represented by  'x' and 'y'.\n**2. Translate the Given Information into Equations:**\n* **Equation 1:** The sum of the product and the sum of the two positive integers is 454. \n   This translates to:  xy + x + y = 454\n**3.  Objective:** \n* Find the largest possible value of the product of their sum and their product: (x + y)(xy)\n**4. Strategy:**\n* We need to maximize the expression (x + y)(xy).  Notice that this looks a bit like the expansion of a perfect square: (x + y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2. \n* Let's try to rewrite our objective expression in a way that uses this perfect square idea.\n**5.  Manipulating the Equations:**\n* Add 1 to both sides of Equation 1:  xy + x + y + 1 = 455\n* Factor the left side: (x + 1)(y + 1) = 455\n**6.  Expressing the Objective:**\n*  We want to maximize (x + y)(xy). \n*  Notice that  (x + y)(xy) = (x + 1)(y + 1)(xy) - xy \n*  Since (x + 1)(y + 1) = 455, we have:  (x + y)(xy) = 455xy - xy\n**7. Finding the Maximum:**\n*  The expression 455xy - xy is maximized when xy is maximized.\n*  Since (x + 1)(y + 1) = 455,  xy will be maximized when x and y are as close as possible in value.\n*  The factors of 455 are 1, 5, 7, 35, 13, and 65.  The two closest factors are 13 and 35.\n**8. Solution:**\n*  Therefore, the largest possible value of (x + y)(xy) occurs when x = 13 and y = 35. \n*  Substituting into the expression: (x + y)(xy) = (13 + 35)(13 * 35) = **48 * 455 = 21840**\n**Therefore, the largest possible value of the product of their sum and their product is 21840.** \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Set up equations**\nLet the two positive integers be *x* and *y*.  We are given the following information:\n*  *xy* + (*x* + *y*) = 454 \n**2.  Express one variable in terms of the other**\nLet's solve the equation for *y*:\n* *y* = (454 - *x*) / (*x* + 1)\n**3.  Define the function to maximize**\nWe want to maximize the product of the sum and the product of *x* and *y*:\n*  *f(x) = (x + y)(xy) \nSubstitute the expression for *y* from step 2:\n*  *f(x) = (x + (454 - *x*) / (*x* + 1)) * (x * (454 - *x*) / (*x* + 1))\n**4. Simplify the function**\n*  *f(x) = (454 * x) / (*x* + 1) * (454 - *x*) / (*x* + 1)\n*  *f(x) = (454^2 * x - 454 * x^2) / (*x* + 1)^2\n**5. Find the critical points**\nTo find the maximum value, we need to find the critical points of *f(x)*. This means finding where the derivative is equal to zero or undefined.  Let's find the derivative of *f(x)*:\n* *f'(x) = [(454^2 * (*x* + 1)^2) - (2 * (454^2 * x - 454 * x^2) * (*x* + 1))] / (*x* + 1)^4 \nSimplify:\n* *f'(x) = (454^2 - 1816 * x) / (*x* + 1)^3\nThe derivative is undefined at *x* = -1, but since we're looking for positive integers, we'll ignore this.  The derivative is zero when:\n* 454^2 - 1816 * x = 0\n* x = 454^2 / 1816 = 113.5\n**6. Check for maximum**\nWe need to check if this critical point represents a maximum. We can use the second derivative test:\n* *f''(x) = [-1816 * (*x* + 1)^3 - 3 * (454^2 - 1816 * x) * (*x* + 1)^2] / (*x* + 1)^6\nEvaluating *f''(113.5)* will be negative, indicating a maximum.\n**7. Find the corresponding y value**\nSince the derivative is 0 at *x* = 113.5, we can use our expression for *y* from step 2 to find *y*:\n* *y* = (454 - 113.5) / (113.5 + 1) = 2.5\n**8. Calculate the maximum product**\nNow that we have *x* and *y*, we can calculate the maximum product:\n* (x + y)(xy) = (113.5 + 2.5) * (113.5 * 2.5) = 34531.25\n**Therefore, the largest possible value of the product of the sum and the product of the two positive integers is 34531.25.** \n"
