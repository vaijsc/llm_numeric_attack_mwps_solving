        "**1. Simplify the expression inside the cube root:**\n*  We have four identical terms of 4^5.  So, we can write this as 4 * 4^5.\n**2. Apply the exponent rule:**\n*  When multiplying exponents with the same base, we add the powers.  So, 4 * 4^5 = 4^(1+5) = 4^6\n**3. Calculate the cube root:**\n*  The cube root of a number is the value that, when multiplied by itself three times, equals the original number. \n*  Since 4^6 = 4^3 * 4^3, we know that the cube root of 4^6 is 4^2.\n**4.
