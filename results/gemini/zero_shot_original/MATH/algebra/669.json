    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "If $x^2+25x+c$ is the square of a binomial, then because the coefficient of $x^2$ is $1$, the binomial must be of the form $x+a$ for some $a$.\n\nExpanding, we have $(x+a)^2 = x^2 + 2ax + a^2$. For this to be equal to $x^2+25x+c$, the coefficients of $x$ must agree, so $2a$ must be equal to $25$. This gives $a=\\frac{25}2$, and so the constant term $a^2$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{625}4}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Problem**\nWe need to find a constant 'c' that makes the expression  x\u00b2 + 25x + c a perfect square trinomial. This means we need to find a binomial (x + a)\u00b2 that expands to give us the original expression.\n**2. Expand the Binomial**\nLet's expand the binomial (x + a)\u00b2:\n(x + a)\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + 2ax + a\u00b2\n**3. Match Coefficients**\nNow, let's compare this expansion to our original expression:\nx\u00b2 + 2ax + a\u00b2  =  x\u00b2 + 25x + c\nWe see that:\n* The coefficient of the x\u00b2 term matches on both sides.\n* The coefficient of the x term on the left side is 2a, and on the right side is 25.  Therefore, 2a = 25, and a = 12.5.\n* The constant term on the left side is a\u00b2, and on the right side is c.\n**4. Calculate the Constant 'c'**\nSince we found a = 12.5, we can calculate c:\nc = a\u00b2 = (12.5)\u00b2 = 156.25\n**Answer**\nTherefore, c = **156.25** makes the expression x\u00b2 + 25x + c a perfect square trinomial, specifically (x + 12.5)\u00b2. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Concept**\nA perfect square trinomial is the result of squaring a binomial. The general form is:\n* (a + b)\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2 \n**2. Apply the Pattern**\nWe want to express the given expression (x\u00b2 + 25x + c) as a perfect square trinomial.  Let's analyze the pattern:\n* The coefficient of the x\u00b2 term is 1 (which is a\u00b2).\n* The coefficient of the x term is 25 (which is 2ab). \n**3. Find 'b'**\n* Since 2ab = 25x, we know that ab = 12.5x.\n* Since a\u00b2 = 1, we have a = 1.\n* Therefore, b = 12.5x / a = 12.5x / 1 = 12.5\n**4. Determine 'c'**\n* The constant term 'c' corresponds to b\u00b2 in the perfect square trinomial pattern.\n* So, c = b\u00b2 = (12.5)\u00b2 = **156.25**\n**Therefore, the value of c is 156.25.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nWe want to find a constant 'c' that makes the quadratic expression  *x\u00b2 + 25x + c* a perfect square trinomial. This means it can be factored into the form (x + a)\u00b2, where 'a' is a constant.\n**2.  Recognize the Pattern of a Perfect Square Trinomial**\nA perfect square trinomial follows this pattern:\n* (x + a)\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + 2ax + a\u00b2\nNotice that the coefficient of the 'x' term (2ax) is twice the product of the square root of the first term (x) and the square root of the last term (a\u00b2).\n**3. Apply the Pattern to the Given Expression**\n* We know the coefficient of the 'x' term is 25.\n* The square root of the first term (x\u00b2) is x.\nLet's find 'a':\n* 2ax = 25x\n* 2a = 25\n* a = 25/2\n**4. Determine the Value of 'c'**\n* Since 'a' represents the square root of the last term in the perfect square trinomial,  a\u00b2 = (25/2)\u00b2 = 625/4\nTherefore, the value of 'c' is **625/4**.\n**5. Verify the Solution**\nLet's check if our answer is correct:\n* (x + 25/2)\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + 2(25/2)x + (25/2)\u00b2 \n*            = x\u00b2 + 25x + 625/4\n**Conclusion**\nThe value of 'c' that makes the expression *x\u00b2 + 25x + c* a perfect square trinomial is **625/4**. \n",
