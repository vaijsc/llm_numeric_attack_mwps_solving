    "solution": "The smallest multiple of 7 between 100 and 200 is 105, and the largest multiple is 196.  Thus, we want to find the sum of the arithmetic series $105 + 112 + \\dots + 196$.\n\nThe $n^{\\text{th}}$ term in this arithmetic sequence is $105 + 7(n - 1) = 7n + 98$.  If $7n + 98 = 196$, then $n = 14$, so the number of terms in this sequence is 14.\n\nThe sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, so the sum is $(105 + 196)/2 \\cdot 14 = \\boxed{2107}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the first multiple of 7 within the range:**\n* Divide 100 by 7, which gives approximately 14.28.\n* The next whole number, 15, is the smallest multiple of 7 greater than 100.  So, 15 * 7 = 105 is the first multiple.\n**2. Find the last multiple of 7 within the range:**\n* Divide 200 by 7, which gives approximately 28.57.\n* The largest whole number less than this is 28. So, 28 * 7 = 196 is the last multiple.\n**3. Form an arithmetic series:**\n* We have an arithmetic series: 105, 112, 119, ..., 196.\n* The first term (a) is 105.\n* The common difference (d) is 7.\n* The last term (l) is 196.\n**4. Use the arithmetic series formula:**\n* The sum (S) of an arithmetic series is: S = (n/2) * (a + l), where n is the number of terms.\n* To find n, we can use the formula: l = a + (n-1)d \n   * 196 = 105 + (n-1)7\n   * 91 = (n-1)7\n   * 13 = n - 1\n   * n = 14\n**5. Calculate the sum:**\n* S = (14/2) * (105 + 196)\n* S = 7 * 301\n* S = 2107\n**Therefore, the sum of all multiples of 7 between 100 and 200 is 2107.** \n",
