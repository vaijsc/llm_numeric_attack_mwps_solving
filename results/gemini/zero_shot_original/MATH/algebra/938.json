    "problem": "It took Lara five days to read a novel. Each day after the first day, Lara read half as many pages as the day before. If the novel was 248 pages long, how many pages did she read on the first day?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "If Lara read $P$ pages on the first day, then she read $P/2$ pages the second day, $P/4$ pages on the third day, $P/8$ pages on the fourth day, and $P/16$ pages on the fifth day.  In total, she read  \\[\nP+\\frac{P}{2}+\\frac{P}{4}+\\frac{P}{8}+\\frac{P}{16}=\\frac{31}{16}P\n\\] pages. Setting this equal to 248, we find that Lara read $P=\\frac{16}{31}\\cdot248=\\boxed{128}$ pages.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Pattern:**\n* Lara reads half the pages each day compared to the previous day. This means the number of pages she reads each day forms a geometric sequence where the common ratio is 1/2.\n**2. Represent the Pages:**\n* Let 'x' be the number of pages Lara read on the first day.\n* On the second day, she read x/2 pages.\n* On the third day, she read (x/2)/2 = x/4 pages.\n* On the fourth day, she read x/8 pages.\n* On the fifth day, she read x/16 pages.\n**3. Set Up the Equation:**\n* The total number of pages is the sum of pages read each day:  x + x/2 + x/4 + x/8 + x/16 = 248\n**4. Solve for x:**\n* To make the equation easier to solve, multiply both sides by 16 (the least common multiple of the denominators): 16x + 8x + 4x + 2x + x = 3968\n* Combine like terms: 31x = 3968\n* Divide both sides by 31: x = 128\n**Answer:** Lara read **128** pages on the first day. \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Reading Pattern:**\n* Day 1:  Let's call the number of pages read on day 1 \"x\".\n* Day 2:  Lara reads half the pages from day 1, so she reads x/2 pages.\n* Day 3:  She reads half the pages from day 2, so she reads (x/2)/2 = x/4 pages.\n* Day 4:  She reads half the pages from day 3, so she reads (x/4)/2 = x/8 pages.\n* Day 5:  She reads half the pages from day 4, so she reads (x/8)/2 = x/16 pages.\n**2. Set up an Equation:**\nThe total number of pages Lara read is the sum of pages read each day, which equals the total length of the novel:\nx + x/2 + x/4 + x/8 + x/16 = 248\n**3. Solve for x:**\n* **Find a common denominator:** The smallest common denominator for all the fractions is 16.  \n* **Rewrite the equation:** 16x/16 + 8x/16 + 4x/16 + 2x/16 + x/16 = 248\n* **Combine like terms:** 31x/16 = 248\n* **Multiply both sides by 16:** 31x = 3968\n* **Divide both sides by 31:** x = 128\n**Answer:** Lara read **128 pages** on the first day. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step by step:\n**1. Understand the Pattern:**\n* Lara reads half the pages each day compared to the day before. This means we have a pattern of dividing by 2 each day.\n**2. Set Up the Equation:**\n* Let 'x' be the number of pages Lara read on the first day.\n* Day 2: x/2\n* Day 3: (x/2)/2 = x/4\n* Day 4: (x/4)/2 = x/8\n* Day 5: (x/8)/2 = x/16\n**3. Total Pages:**\n* The total pages read over the five days must equal 248.  So: \n   x + x/2 + x/4 + x/8 + x/16 = 248\n**4. Solve for x:**\n* To solve for x, we need to find a common denominator for all the fractions, which is 16:\n   16x/16 + 8x/16 + 4x/16 + 2x/16 + x/16 = 248\n* Combine the terms:\n   31x/16 = 248\n* Multiply both sides by 16:\n   31x = 3968\n* Divide both sides by 31:\n   x = 128\n**Answer:** Lara read **128** pages on the first day. \n",
