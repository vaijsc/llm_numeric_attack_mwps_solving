        "We want to find the values of $k$ for which the equation $1 + k(n - 1) = 2005$ has a positive integer solution for $n$.  Simplifying, we get $kn = 2006$.  This means $k$ must be a divisor of 2006.\nTo find the number of divisors of 2006, we first prime factorize it: $2006 = 2\\cdot17\\cdot59$.  A divisor of 2006 can have 0, 1, or 2 factors of 2, 0 or 1 factors of 17, and 0 or 1 factors of 59.  Therefore, there are $3\\cdot2\\cdot2 = \\boxed{12}$ divisors of 2006, and thus 12 values of $k$. \n",

        "Here's how we can solve this problem:\n**Understanding the Problem**\n* **Arithmetic Sequence:**  An arithmetic sequence is a list of numbers where the difference between any two consecutive terms is constant (called the common difference).\n* **Finding a Term:** We want to know how many times we can find the number 2005 as a term in sequences of the form 1, 1 + k, 1 + 2k, 1 + 3k, ...\n**Setting Up the Equation**\nIf 2005 is a term in the sequence $S_k$, then we can write it as:\n2005 = 1 + (n-1)k\nwhere 'n' is the position of 2005 in the sequence.  \n**Solving for k**\n1. **Simplify:**  Subtract 1 from both sides: \n   2004 = (n-1)k\n2. **Factor:** 2004 can be factored as 2 x 2 x 3 x 167.\n3. **Possible Values of k:** Since k is the common difference, it must be a factor of 2004.  Here are the possible values of k:\n   * k = 1\n   * k = 2\n   * k = 3\n   * k = 4\n   * k = 6\n   * k = 12\n   * k = 167\n   * k = 334\n   * k = 501\n   * k = 668\n   * k = 1002\n   * k = 2004\n**Checking for Validity**\nFor each value of k, we need to make sure that there's a corresponding positive integer 'n' that satisfies the equation 2004 = (n-1)k.  Let's check a few examples:\n* **k = 2:**  2004 = (n-1)2.  This gives us n = 1003, which is a valid positive integer.\n* **k = 5:** 2004 = (n-1)5.  This leads to n = 401.8, which is not a whole number.  Therefore, k = 5 is not a valid solution.\n**Counting the Valid Values**\nBy checking each of the possible values of k, you'll find that there are **8** values of k for which the sequence $S_k$ contains 2005 as a term. \n",
        "We want to find the values of $k$ for which there exists an integer $n$ such that \n\\[1 + k(n - 1) = 2005.\\]This simplifies to $kn = 2006.$  Thus, $k$ must be a divisor of 2006.  To count the number of divisors of 2006, we factor 2006 as $2 \\cdot 17 \\cdot 59.$  The number of divisors of 2006 is then $(1 + 1)(1 + 1)(1 + 1) = \\boxed{8}.$",
