    "problem": "To calculate $42^2$, Emily mentally figures the value $40^2$ and adds $164$. Emily subtracts a number from $40^2$ to calculate $38^2$. What number does she subtract?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We see that $38^2 = (40 - 2)^2 = 40^2 - 4\\cdot 40 +4 = 40^2 - 156$. Therefore, Emily subtracts $\\boxed{156}$.",

        "Here's how to break down Emily's calculations:\n* **Calculating 42\u00b2:**\n   * Emily starts with 40\u00b2, which is 1600.\n   * She then adds 164 to get 1764 (which is 42\u00b2).  This works because:\n      * (40 + 2)\u00b2 = 40\u00b2 + 2(40)(2) + 2\u00b2 \n      * 42\u00b2 = 1600 + 160 + 4 = 1764\n* **Calculating 38\u00b2:**\n    * Emily starts with 40\u00b2, which is 1600.\n    * She needs to find the difference between 40\u00b2 and 38\u00b2. This difference is  (40 + 38)(40 - 38) = 78 x 2 = 156.\n    * Therefore, Emily subtracts **156** from 1600 to get 1444 (which is 38\u00b2). \n**So the answer is 156.** \n",
