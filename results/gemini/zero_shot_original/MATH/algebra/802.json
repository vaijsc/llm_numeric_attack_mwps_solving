        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Simplify the equation:**\n* Combine the terms with $\\sqrt{x}$: \n   $x\\sqrt{x} - 9\\sqrt{x} = \\sqrt{x}(x-9)$\n*  The equation becomes: $\\sqrt{x}(x-9) - 5x = 35$\n**2. Isolate the radical term:**\n* Add $5x$ to both sides:  $\\sqrt{x}(x-9) = 5x + 35$\n* Factor out a 5 on the right side:  $\\sqrt{x}(x-9) = 5(x + 7)$\n**3. Solve for x:**\n* **Consider the cases:** \n   * **Case 1:  x = 0**  If x is zero, the equation becomes 0 = 35, which is false. So, x cannot be 0.\n   * **Case 2:  x > 0** If x is positive, we can square both sides of the equation to eliminate the radical.  \n      * Squaring both sides:  $x(x-9)^2 = 25(x+7)^2$\n      * Expanding:  $x(x^2 - 18x + 81) = 25(x^2 + 14x + 49)$\n      * Simplifying:  $x^3 - 18x^2 + 81x = 25x^2 + 350x + 1225$\n      * Bringing all terms to one side:  $x^3 - 43x^2 - 269x - 1225 = 0$\n      * This is a cubic equation.  We can use numerical methods or factoring techniques to solve for x.  One possible solution is x = 25.\n**4. Check the solution:**\n* Substitute x = 25 back into the original equation:\n    * $25\\sqrt{25} - 5(25) - 9\\sqrt{25} = 35$\n    * $125 - 125 - 45 = 35$ \n    * This is incorrect.  Therefore, x = 25 is not a valid solution.\n**5.  Conclusion:**\nSince we've ruled out x = 0 and the solution we found (x = 25) is incorrect, there is no integer solution to the equation.  It's possible that the equation has a non-integer solution, but we haven't explored that here. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step by step:\n**1. Simplify the equation:**\n* Notice that the equation has terms with both $\\sqrt{x}$ and $x$. To simplify, let's make a substitution. Let $y = \\sqrt{x}$. This gives us:\n   * $y^3 - 5y^2 - 9y = 35$ \n**2. Rearrange the equation:**\n* Move all terms to one side to get a polynomial equation:\n   * $y^3 - 5y^2 - 9y - 35 = 0$\n**3. Factor the polynomial:**\n*  We can factor the polynomial by grouping: \n   *  $(y^3 - 5y^2) + (-9y - 35) = 0$\n   *  $y^2(y - 5) - 7(y + 5) = 0$\n   *  To factor further, we can manipulate the second term: \n   *  $y^2(y - 5) - 7(-y - 5) = 0$\n   *  $y^2(y - 5) + 7(y + 5) = 0$ \n   *  Now we can factor by grouping:\n   *  $(y - 5)(y^2 + 7) = 0$\n**4. Solve for y:**\n* We have two factors that could equal zero:\n   *  $y - 5 = 0  \\Rightarrow y = 5$\n   *  $y^2 + 7 = 0  \\Rightarrow y^2 = -7$. This has no real solutions since the square of a real number cannot be negative.\n**5. Substitute back for x:**\n* Remember that $y = \\sqrt{x}$.  Since we found $y = 5$, we can substitute back:\n   *  $\\sqrt{x} = 5$\n   *  $x = 5^2 = 25$\n**Therefore, the solution is x = 25.** \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem:\n**1.  Rearrange and Factor**\n   * Move all terms to one side of the equation: \n     $x\\sqrt{x} - 5x - 9\\sqrt{x} - 35 = 0$\n   * Notice that we can factor out a $\\sqrt{x}$ from the first three terms:\n     $\\sqrt{x}(x - 9) - 5(x + 7) = 0$\n**2.  Consider Integer Solutions**\n   * Since we're looking for an integer solution for *x*, let's think about what values of *x* would make the expression equal to zero. \n   * We need either $\\sqrt{x}(x - 9) = 0$ or  $5(x + 7) = 0$.\n**3.  Solve for x**\n   *  **Case 1:**  $\\sqrt{x}(x - 9) = 0$ \n       * This means either $\\sqrt{x} = 0$ or $x - 9 = 0$.\n       * Solving these, we get *x* = 0 or *x* = 9.\n   * **Case 2:**  $5(x + 7) = 0$\n       * This means *x* + 7 = 0.\n       * Solving for *x*, we get *x* = -7.\n**4.  Check Solutions**\n   * Let's check each potential solution by plugging it back into the original equation:\n      * For *x* = 0, the equation is true.\n      * For *x* = 9, the equation is true.\n      * For *x* = -7, the equation is not true because we'd have a square root of a negative number.\n**Solution**\nTherefore, the integer solutions for *x* are **x = 0** and **x = 9**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step by step:\n**1. Rearrange the equation:**\nBegin by moving all the terms to one side of the equation:\n  *  $x\\sqrt{x} - 5x - 9\\sqrt{x} - 35 = 0$\n**2. Look for common factors:**\nNotice that the terms involving  'x' and '\u221ax' can be grouped together:\n *  $(x\\sqrt{x} - 9\\sqrt{x}) - (5x + 35) = 0$\n**3. Factor out common factors:**\n*  Factor out \u221ax from the first group and 5 from the second group:\n   *  \u221ax (x - 9) - 5(x + 7) = 0\n**4.  Recognize the potential for substitution:**\nWe have a term (x - 9) and another (x + 7). Let's try a substitution to make the equation simpler.\n* **Let y = x - 9**\n* **Then, x + 7 = y + 16**\n**5. Substitute and simplify:**\n* Our equation now becomes:\n   * \u221a(y + 9) * y - 5(y + 16) = 0\n**6. Solve the equation:**\nThis equation looks a bit messy, but we can solve it by recognizing that we need to find a value of 'y' that makes the entire expression equal to zero. Since the expression is a difference of two terms, one of those terms must be equal to the other.\nLet's explore this idea:\n* **If \u221a(y + 9) * y = 0** , then either \u221a(y + 9) = 0 or y = 0. \n   * \u221a(y + 9) = 0  means y + 9 = 0,  so y = -9.\n   * y = 0 is also a possible solution.\n* **If 5(y + 16) = 0**, then y + 16 = 0, so y = -16.\n**7. Check the solutions:**\nWe need to check if any of our potential values of 'y' actually satisfy the original equation. \n* **y = -9:** This would mean x = 0.  Let's plug this into the original equation:\n   * 0 - 0 - 0 = 35.  This is not true, so y = -9 is not a valid solution.\n* **y = 0:** This would mean x = 9. Let's plug this into the original equation:\n   * 9 * 3 - 45 - 27 = 35. This is not true, so y = 0 is not a valid solution.\n* **y = -16:** This would mean x = -7.  Let's plug this into the original equation:\n   * -7 * \u221a(-7) + 35 - 9 * \u221a(-7) = 35.  This simplifies to 42\u221a(-7) = 0. Since the square root of a negative number is imaginary, this solution is also not valid.\n**8. Conclusion:**\nThere is no integer solution for 'x' that satisfies the original equation. \n",
        "Here's how we can solve the equation:\n1. **Rearrange the equation:**\n   Combine the terms with $\\sqrt{x}$ and the terms with $x$:\n   \n   $x\\sqrt{x} - 9\\sqrt{x} - 5x = 35$\n2. **Factor out common factors:**\n   Notice that both the first and second terms have a common factor of $\\sqrt{x}$, and the second and third terms have a common factor of $x$.  Factor these out:\n   $\\sqrt{x}(x - 9) - 5x = 35$\n3. **Isolate the $\\sqrt{x}$ term:**\n   Move the $-5x$ term to the right side of the equation:\n   $\\sqrt{x}(x - 9) = 35 + 5x$\n4. **Consider the possibilities:**\n   Since we're looking for integer solutions, we need to find values of $x$ that make both sides of the equation integers.  Let's analyze the right side:\n   * **If $x$ is positive:**  The right side will be positive.\n   * **If $x$ is negative:** The right side will be negative.\n   This means that the left side, $\\sqrt{x}(x-9)$, must also be positive or negative depending on the value of $x$.\n5. **Test values:**\n   Let's try some integer values of $x$ and see if we get a solution:\n   * **If $x = 1$:** \n      * The right side: $35 + 5(1) = 40$\n      * The left side: $\\sqrt{1}(1-9) = -8$. This doesn't work.\n   * **If $x = 4$:**\n      * The right side: $35 + 5(4) = 55$\n      * The left side: $\\sqrt{4}(4-9) = -10$. This doesn't work.\n   * **If $x = 9$:**\n      * The right side: $35 + 5(9) = 80$\n      * The left side: $\\sqrt{9}(9-9) = 0$. This doesn't work.\n   * **If $x = 16$:**\n      * The right side: $35 + 5(16) = 115$\n      * The left side: $\\sqrt{16}(16-9) = 56$. This doesn't work.\n   Since we haven't found a solution, we need to keep trying values.  However, notice that as $x$ gets larger, the right side of the equation grows much faster than the left side. This suggests that there might not be any integer solutions.\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   We've tested a few values and haven't found an integer solution. It's likely that this equation has no integer solutions for $x$. To be absolutely sure, we would need to use more sophisticated methods (like graphing or calculus) to prove there are no solutions. \n"
