        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Calculate the net annual savings:**\n* The technology saves you $1200 per year.\n* You spend $650 per year on maintenance.\n* Net annual savings: $1200 - $650 = $550\n**2. Determine how many years it takes to recoup the initial cost:**\n* Initial cost: $10,000\n* Net annual savings: $550\n* Years to recoup: $10,000 / $550 = 18.18 years (approximately)\n**3. Round to the nearest whole year:**\n* Since we need whole years, round 18.18 years up to **19 years**.\n**Answer:** It will take **19 years** to recuperate the costs of the green technology. \n",
        "Here's how to break down the problem to find the solution:\n**1. Calculate the annual net savings:**\n* Savings from energy bills: $1200\n* Maintenance costs: $650\n* Net savings per year: $1200 - $650 = $550\n**2. Calculate the number of years to recoup the installation cost:**\n* Total installation cost: $10,000\n* Net savings per year: $550\n* Years to recoup: $10,000 / $550 = 18.18 years (approximately)\n**3. Round up to the nearest whole year:**\nSince we're looking for whole years, we round 18.18 years up to **19 years**.\n**Answer:** It will take **19 years** to recuperate the costs of the green technology. \n",

        "Here's how to break down the problem:\n* **Annual Savings:** You save $1200 per year on energy bills.\n* **Annual Net Cost:** You spend $650 per year on maintenance, so your net annual savings are $1200 - $650 = $550.\n* **Cost to Recover:** You need to recover the initial $10,000 installation cost.\n* **Years to Recover:** Divide the total cost by the annual net savings: $10,000 / $550 = 18.18 years.\n**Answer:** It will take approximately **19 whole years** to recuperate the costs of installing the green technology. \n",
        "Here's how to figure out how long it takes to recoup the costs:\n**1. Calculate the annual net savings:**\n* Savings from energy bills: $1200\n* Maintenance costs: -$650\n* **Net annual savings:** $1200 - $650 = $550\n**2. Calculate the number of years to recoup the initial cost:**\n* Initial cost: $10,000\n* Net annual savings: $550\n* **Years to recoup:** $10,000 / $550 \u2248 18.18 years\n**3. Round up to the nearest whole year:**\n* Since you can't have a fraction of a year, round 18.18 up to **19 years**.\n**Answer:** It will take **19 years** to recuperate your costs. \n"
