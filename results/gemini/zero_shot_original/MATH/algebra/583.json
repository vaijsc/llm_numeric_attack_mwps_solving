        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Simplify the exponent:**\n*  (2^3) = 8 \n*  So, the problem becomes: 8^(2^3) = 2^N\n**2. Simplify the base:**\n* (2^3) = 8\n* So, the problem becomes: 8^8 = 2^N\n**3. Express the base as a power of 2:**\n* 8 is the same as 2^3\n* So, the problem becomes: (2^3)^8 = 2^N\n**4. Apply the power of a power rule:**\n* When you raise a power to another power, you multiply the exponents.\n* (2^3)^8 = 2^(3*8) = 2^24\n**5. Solve for N:**\n* Now we have: 2^24 = 2^N\n* Since the bases are the same, the exponents must be equal.\n* Therefore, N = 24\n**Answer:** The value of N is **24**. \n",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n1. **Simplify the exponent:**  $(2^3)^{(2^3)}$ means we're raising 2 cubed to the power of 2 cubed.  Since 2 cubed is 8, this becomes  $8^8$.\n2. **Express 8 as a power of 2:**  We know that 8 is the same as 2 cubed, so we can write $8^8$ as $(2^3)^8$.\n3. **Apply the power of a power rule:**  When raising a power to another power, we multiply the exponents.  This means $(2^3)^8$ is equal to $2^{3*8}$.\n4. **Calculate the final exponent:**  3 multiplied by 8 is 24, so we have $2^{24}$.\n**Therefore, the value of N is 24.** \n",
