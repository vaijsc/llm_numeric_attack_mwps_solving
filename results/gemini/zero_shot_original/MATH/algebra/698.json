    "solution": "The point at which the company goes bankrupt is where $y=0$, the $x$-intercept. To solve for the $x$-intercept, we set $y=0$ and get \\begin{align*}\n0 &=-265x+2800\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad -2800&=-265x\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad \\frac{2800}{265} &= x.\n\\end{align*} Realizing that $\\frac{2800}{265}$ is between 10, or $\\frac{2650}{265}$, and 11, or $\\frac{2915}{265}$, then the company can hire at most $\\boxed{10}$ workers, since hiring 11 would bring it past the $x$-intercept and into debt.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Equation:**\n* The equation  *y* = -265*x* + 2800 represents the company's financial situation. \n*  *y* represents the amount of money the company has.\n* *x* represents the number of workers hired.\n* The slope (-265) indicates that for each worker hired, the company loses $265.\n* The y-intercept (2800) is the starting amount of money the company has.\n**2. Find the Break-Even Point:**\n*  The company goes bankrupt when it has no money left, meaning *y* = 0.\n* Substitute *y* = 0 into the equation and solve for *x*:\n    0 = -265*x* + 2800\n**3. Solve for *x*:**\n* Subtract 2800 from both sides: -2800 = -265*x*\n* Divide both sides by -265: *x* = 10.57\n**4. Interpret the Answer:**\n* Since you can't hire a fraction of a worker, the company can hire a maximum of **10 workers** before going bankrupt. \n**Therefore, the maximum number of workers the company can hire is 10.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n* **Understanding the equation:** The equation  y = -265x + 2800 represents the company's financial situation. \n    *  'y' is the amount of money the company has.\n    * '-265' represents the cost of hiring each worker. \n    * 'x' is the number of workers hired.\n    * '2800' is the starting amount of money the company has.\n* **Finding the bankruptcy point:**  The company goes bankrupt when it has no money left, meaning y = 0. We need to find the value of 'x' when y = 0.\n* **Setting up the equation:** \n   0 = -265x + 2800\n* **Solving for x:**\n   1. Subtract 2800 from both sides: -2800 = -265x\n   2. Divide both sides by -265: x = 2800 / 265\n* **Calculating x:**  x \u2248 10.57\n* **Interpreting the result:**  The company can hire approximately 10.57 workers. Since you can't hire parts of a worker, the company can hire a maximum of **10 workers** before going bankrupt. \n",
