        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Use the quadratic formula**\nSince the roots are given, we can use the quadratic formula to relate them to the coefficients of the quadratic:\n* For a quadratic equation of the form  *ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0*, the quadratic formula states:\n   *x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / 2a*\n**2.

Choose the positive solution**\nSince the problem states *b > 0*, we choose the positive solution:\n* b = 2 + \u221a21\n**6.
