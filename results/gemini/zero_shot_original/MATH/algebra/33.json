        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the slope of the line.**\n* The slope of a line is the change in y divided by the change in x.\n* Using the first two points (2, -5) and (p, -14), we get:\n   (change in y) / (change in x) = (-14 - (-5)) / (p - 2) = -9 / (p - 2)\n* Using the second and third points (p, -14) and (p+2, -17), we get:\n   (change in y) / (change in x) = (-17 - (-14)) / (p+2 - p) = -3 / 2\n**2. Set the slopes equal to each other.**\n* Since the points lie on the same line, the slopes must be equal.\n*  -9 / (p - 2) = -3 / 2\n**3. Solve for p.**\n* Cross-multiply: -9 * 2 = -3 * (p - 2)\n* Simplify: -18 = -3p + 6\n* Add 3p to both sides: 3p - 18 = 6\n* Add 18 to both sides: 3p = 24\n* Divide both sides by 3: p = 8\n**4. Find the equation of the line.**\n* We can use the point-slope form of a linear equation: y - y1 = m(x - x1)\n* Using the point (2, -5) and the slope we found (-3/2): \n   y - (-5) = (-3/2)(x - 2)\n* Simplify: y + 5 = (-3/2)x + 3\n* Subtract 5 from both sides: y = (-3/2)x - 2\n**5. Find q.**\n* Since the point (13, q) lies on the line, we can substitute x = 13 into the equation and solve for q:\n   q = (-3/2)(13) - 2 \n   q = -19.5 - 2\n   q = -21.5\n**6. Calculate p + q.**\n* p + q = 8 + (-21.5) = -13.5\n**Therefore, p + q = -13.5** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Find the slope:**\n* We can use any two points from the table to find the slope. Let's use (2, -5) and (p, -14).\n* The slope formula is:  (change in y) / (change in x)\n* Slope = (-14 - (-5)) / (p - 2) = -9 / (p - 2)\n**2.

Find the equation of the line:**\n* Now that we know p = 8, we can use the point-slope form of a linear equation with any of the points.

Substitute x = 13 into the equation we just found:\n*  q = (-3/2)(13) - 2 = -19.5 - 2 = -21.5\n**6.
