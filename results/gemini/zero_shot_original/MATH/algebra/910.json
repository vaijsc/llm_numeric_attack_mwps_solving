Understand the Pattern:**\nAn arithmetic sequence has a constant difference between consecutive terms, called the common difference (d). \n**2. Set Up Equations:**\n* Let the first term of the sequence be 'a'.\n* The 7th term is a + 6d = 30 \n* The 11th term is a + 10d = 60\n**3. Solve for the Common Difference (d):**\n* Subtract the first equation from the second equation:\n   (a + 10d) - (a + 6d) = 60 - 30\n   4d = 30\n   d = 7.5 \n**4. Solve for the First Term (a):**\n* Substitute the value of d (7.5) into either of the original equations. Let's use the first equation:\n   a + 6(7.5) = 30\n   a + 45 = 30\n   a = -15\n**5. Find the 21st Term:**\n* The general formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is:  a_n = a + (n-1)d\n* Substitute the values we found:\n   a_21 = -15 + (21-1) * 7.5\n   a_21 = -15 + 20 * 7.5\n   a_21 = -15 + 150\n   a_21 = 135\n**Therefore, the 21st term of this arithmetic sequence is 135.** \n",

This can be written as: a + 10d = 60 \nwhere 'a' is the first term.\n**3.

Solve for the First Term (a)**\nSubstitute the value of 'd' (7.5) back into either of the original equations. Let's use the first equation:\na + 6(7.5) = 30\na + 45 = 30\na = -15\n**5.

Understand Arithmetic Sequences**\nAn arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers where the difference between any two consecutive terms is constant. This constant difference is called the common difference.\n**2. Use the Given Information**\n* We know the 7th term is 30.\n* We know the 11th term is 60.\n**3. Find the Common Difference**\nSince there are 4 terms between the 7th and 11th terms, the difference between these terms represents 4 times the common difference.\n*  60 - 30 = 30\n*  30 / 4 = 7.5  (This is the common difference)\n**4. Find the First Term**\n* We can work backwards from the 7th term:\n    * 7th term (30) - common difference (7.5) = 22.5 (6th term)\n    * 6th term (22.5) - common difference (7.5) = 15 (5th term)\n    * 5th term (15) - common difference (7.5) = 7.5 (4th term)\n    * 4th term (7.5) - common difference (7.5) = 0 (3rd term)\n    * 3rd term (0) - common difference (7.5) = -7.5 (2nd term)\n    * 2nd term (-7.5) - common difference (7.5) = -15 (1st term)\n**5. Find the 21st Term**\nNow that we know the first term (-15) and the common difference (7.5), we can find the 21st term using the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence:\n* a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d \n   where:\n    * a_n is the nth term\n    * a_1 is the first term\n    * d is the common difference\n    * n is the term number\n* a_21 = -15 + (21 - 1) * 7.5\n* a_21 = -15 + 20 * 7.5\n* a_21 = -15 + 150\n* a_21 = 135\n**Therefore, the 21st term of the arithmetic sequence is 135.** \n",
