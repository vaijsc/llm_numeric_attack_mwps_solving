    "solution": "Denote our number as $10a+b,$ where $a$ and $b$ represent the tens and units digit, respectively. It follows that $2ab=10a+b,$ or  \\[2a(b-5)-(b-5)=5\\] \\[(2a-1)(b-5)=5.\\] We start by minimizing $a.$ If $2a-1=1$ and $b-5=5,$ $(a,b)=(1,10),$ which does not work because $b$ cannot exceed 9. Trying the second case, $2a-1=5$ and $b-5=1,$ leaving us with $(a,b)=(3,6).$ Thus, the smallest positive integer meeting the problem conditions is $\\boxed{36}.$",

        "Let's break down the problem:\n* **Representing the number:**  Let the ten's digit be  'x' and the unit's digit be 'y'. The number can be represented as 10x + y. \n* **Product of digits:** The product of the digits is x * y.\n* **Condition:** We're given that the product of the digits is half the number:  x * y = (10x + y) / 2\nNow, let's solve for x and y:\n1. **Simplify the equation:** \n   2xy = 10x + y\n   2xy - 10x - y = 0\n2. **Rearrange to make it easier to factor:**\n   2xy - 10x - y + 5 = 5 \n   2x(y - 5) - 1(y - 5) = 5\n   (2x - 1)(y - 5) = 5\n3. **Find factors of 5:** The factors of 5 are 1 and 5.  We need to find values for (2x - 1) and (y - 5) that satisfy this equation.\n4. **Test the possibilities:**\n   * If (2x - 1) = 1, then x = 1 and (y - 5) = 5, which means y = 10 (not a single digit).\n   * If (2x - 1) = 5, then x = 3 and (y - 5) = 1, which means y = 6.\n**Therefore, the smallest two-digit positive integer that satisfies the condition is 36.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Set up the problem:**\n* Let the tens digit be represented by the variable 'x'.\n* Let the units digit be represented by the variable 'y'.\n* The two-digit integer can be written as 10x + y.\n* The product of the digits is x * y.\n* The problem states that the product of the digits is half the integer. \n**2. Translate the problem into an equation:**\nx * y = (1/2) * (10x + y)\n**3. Simplify the equation:**\n2xy = 10x + y\n2xy - 10x - y = 0\n**4. Solve for one variable in terms of the other:**\nLet's solve for y: \ny (2x - 1) = 10x\ny = (10x) / (2x - 1)\n**5. Find possible values for x and y:**\nSince x and y are digits, they must be integers between 0 and 9.  We can test different values of x to see if we get an integer value for y:\n* **If x = 1:**  y = 10/(2 - 1) = 10 (Not valid, y must be between 0 and 9)\n* **If x = 2:** y = 20/(4 - 1) = 6.67 (Not valid, y must be an integer)\n* **If x = 3:** y = 30/(6 - 1) = 6 (Valid!)\n**6. Determine the integer:**\nSince x = 3 and y = 6, the smallest two-digit integer that satisfies the condition is **36**. \n",

The two-digit number can then be expressed as 10x + y.\n* **Set up the equation:** We are told that the product of the digits (x * y) is equal to half the integer (1/2 * (10x + y)).

We'll need to use trial and error.  Since we are looking for the smallest two-digit integer, let's start with small values for x and see if we can find a matching y.\n**Trying values for x:**\n* **x = 1:**  \n    * The equation becomes: 2y - 10 - y = 0\n    * Solving for y, we get y = 10. This doesn't work because y should be a single digit.\n* **x = 2:**\n    * The equation becomes: 4y - 20 - y = 0\n    * Solving for y, we get y = 20/3.  This doesn't work because y should be an integer.\n* **x = 3:**\n    * The equation becomes: 6y - 30 - y = 0\n    * Solving for y, we get y = 6.
