    "solution": "Setting the two expressions for $y$ equal to each other, it follows that $2x^2 + kx + 6 = -x + 4$. Re-arranging, $2x^2 + (k+1)x + 2 = 0$. For there to be exactly one solution for $x$, then the discriminant of the given quadratic must be equal to zero. Thus, $(k+1)^2 - 4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = (k+1)^2 - 16 = 0$, so $k+1 = \\pm 4$. Taking the negative value, $k = \\boxed{-5}$.",

        "**1. Understand the Problem**\nWe have two equations representing parabolas (the first) and a line (the second).  The question asks for a value of *k* that makes the parabola and line intersect at exactly one point. This means the line is tangent to the parabola.\n**2.
