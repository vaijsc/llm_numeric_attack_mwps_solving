        "Here's how to solve the equation step-by-step:\n1. **Factor out a common term:** Notice that both terms on the left side of the equation have $6^x$ as a factor.  We can rewrite the equation as: \n   \n   $6^x (6^1 - 1) = 1080$\n2. **Simplify:** Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:\n   $6^x (6 - 1) = 1080$\n   $6^x (5) = 1080$\n3. **Isolate the exponential term:** Divide both sides by 5:\n   $6^x = 216$\n4. **Express the right side as a power of 6:** Recognize that 216 is equal to $6^3$:\n   $6^x = 6^3$\n5. **Solve for x:** Since the bases are now the same, the exponents must be equal:\n   $x = 3$\n**Therefore, the value of x in the equation is 3.** \n",
