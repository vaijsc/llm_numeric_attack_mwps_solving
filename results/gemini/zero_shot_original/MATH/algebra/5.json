        "Here's how to find the 100th term of the arithmetic sequence:\n**1. Find the common difference:**\n* The common difference is the constant amount added to get from one term to the next. \n* In this sequence, the common difference is 10 - 6 = 4.\n**2.  Use the arithmetic sequence formula:**\n* The general formula for an arithmetic sequence is: \n   * a<sub>n</sub> = a<sub>1</sub> + (n - 1) * d\n   * Where:\n      * a<sub>n</sub> is the nth term \n      * a<sub>1</sub> is the first term\n      * n is the term number\n      * d is the common difference\n**3. Substitute the values:**\n* We want to find a<sub>100</sub> (the 100th term).\n* a<sub>1</sub> = 6 (the first term)\n* n = 100 (the term number)\n* d = 4 (the common difference)\n**4. Calculate:**\n* a<sub>100</sub> = 6 + (100 - 1) * 4\n* a<sub>100</sub> = 6 + 99 * 4\n* a<sub>100</sub> = 6 + 396\n* a<sub>100</sub> = 402\n**Therefore, the 100th term of the arithmetic sequence 6, 10, 14, 18, ... is 402.** \n",
