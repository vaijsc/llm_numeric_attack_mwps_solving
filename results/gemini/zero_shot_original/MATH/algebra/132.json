        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Solve for x and y**\n* **Add the two equations together:** \n   (x + y) + (x - y) = 12 + 8\n   2x = 20\n   x = 10\n* **Substitute the value of x (10) into either original equation to solve for y:**\n   10 + y = 12\n   y = 2\n**2. Substitute the values of x and y into the expression 2x - xy**\n* 2(10) - (10)(2) = 20 - 20 = 0\n**Therefore, the value of 2x - xy is 0.** \n",
