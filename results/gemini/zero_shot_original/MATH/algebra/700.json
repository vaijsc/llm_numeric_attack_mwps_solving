    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "In two hours, a car traveling at $50$ mph would travel $50$ mph $\\times 2$ hours $= 100$ miles. Now we find how far a car can travel in $3/4$ of an hour which is $50$ mph $\\times \\frac{3}{4}$ hours $ = \\frac{150}{4} = 37 \\frac{1}{2}$ miles. Thus, the car would travel a total of $100 + 37 \\frac{1}{2}= \\boxed{137 \\frac{1}{2}}$ miles.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Convert the mixed number to a fraction:**\n*  2 3/4 = (2 * 4 + 3) / 4 = 11/4 hours\n**2. Multiply the speed by the time to find the distance:**\n* Distance = Speed * Time\n* Distance = 50 miles/hour * (11/4) hours\n* Distance = 550/4 miles\n**3. Simplify the fraction:**\n* 550/4 = 137 1/2 miles\n**Answer:** The car would travel **137 1/2 miles** in 2 3/4 hours. \n",
