    "solution": "Let's find the sum of the first ten positive integers: $1+2+\\ldots+10=\\frac{10(1+10)}{2}=55$. Now we need to find which of the first ten positive integers, when subtracted from 55, gives a perfect square, namely 49 (36 is 19 away from 55, so it cannot be obtained). The desired integer is $\\boxed{6}$ since $55-6=49=7^2$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Calculate the sum of the first ten positive integers:**\n   The sum of the first *n* positive integers is given by the formula *n(n+1)/2*.  Therefore, the sum of the first ten positive integers is 10(10+1)/2 = 55.\n**2. Find the possible square numbers less than 55:**\n   The square numbers less than 55 are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, and 49.\n**3.  Subtract each square number from 55:**\n   * 55 - 1 = 54\n   * 55 - 4 = 51\n   * 55 - 9 = 46\n   * 55 - 16 = 39\n   * 55 - 25 = 30\n   * 55 - 36 = 19\n   * 55 - 49 = 6\n**4. Identify the result that is a positive integer:**\n   Only 6 is a positive integer.\n**5. Conclusion:**\n   Marsha did not include the number **6** in her sum. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Calculate the sum of the first ten positive integers:**\nThe sum of the first ten positive integers is 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 10 = 55.\n**2.  Find the square numbers close to 55:**\nThe nearest square numbers to 55 are 49 (7\u00b2) and 64 (8\u00b2).\n**3.  Determine the missing integer:**\n* To get 49, Marsha would need to exclude 6 (55 - 6 = 49)\n* To get 64, Marsha would need to exclude 41 (55 - 41 = 14, not a square number).\n**4.  The answer:**\nTherefore, Marsha did not include the number **6**. \n",

Find the sum of the first ten positive integers:**\n   The sum of the first *n* positive integers is given by the formula: n(n+1)/2\n   In this case, n = 10, so the sum is: 10(10+1)/2 = 55\n**2.  Consider the possible square numbers:**\n    Since Marsha's sum is a square number, let's think about the perfect squares less than 55: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49.\n**3. Subtract the squares from the total sum:**\n   * 55 - 1 = 54\n   * 55 - 4 = 51\n   * 55 - 9 = 46\n   * 55 - 16 = 39\n   * 55 - 25 = 30\n   * 55 - 36 = 19\n   * 55 - 49 = 6\n**4. Check if the differences are sums of consecutive integers:**\n   We're looking for a difference that represents the sum of 9 consecutive integers.  Of the above differences, only 36 is the sum of 9 consecutive integers: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 36\n**Conclusion:**\nMarsha did not include the number **9** in her sum. \n",
