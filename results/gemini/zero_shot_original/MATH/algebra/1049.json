        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Start with the innermost function:**\n*  We begin with  `f(12)`: \n   *  `f(12) = (1 + 12) / (1 - 12) = 13 / -11 = -13/11`\n**2. Apply `g` to the result:**\n* `g(-13/11) = -2 / (-13/11 + 1) = -2 / (-2/11) = 11`\n**3. Apply `f` to the result:**\n* `f(11) = (1 + 11) / (1 - 11) = 12 / -10 = -6/5`\n**4. Apply `g` to the result:**\n* `g(-6/5) = -2 / (-6/5 + 1) = -2 / (-1/5) = 10`\n**5. Continue this pattern:**\n* `f(10) = (1 + 10) / (1 - 10) = 11 / -9 = -11/9`\n* `g(-11/9) = -2 / (-11/9 + 1) = -2 / (-2/9) = 9`\n* `f(9) = (1 + 9) / (1 - 9) = 10 / -8 = -5/4`\n* `g(-5/4) = -2 / (-5/4 + 1) = -2 / (-1/4) = 8`\n**6. Apply `f` one last time:**\n* `f(8) = (1 + 8) / (1 - 8) = 9 / -7 = -9/7`\n**Therefore, the value of the expression is -9/7.** \n**Important Note:** This problem demonstrates a pattern that arises from repeatedly composing functions.  While we could continue this process for 8 applications of each function, it becomes tedious. In more advanced scenarios, understanding this pattern and finding a general formula for the composition would be more efficient. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Start with the innermost function:**\n* We begin with  `f(12)`.  Substitute  `x = 12` into the expression for `f(x)`:\n   *  `f(12) = (1 + 12) / (1 - 12) = 13 / -11`\n**2. Apply the next function, `g`:**\n* Now we have `g(f(12)) = g(13/-11)`. Substitute `x = 13/-11` into the expression for `g(x)`:\n   *  `g(13/-11) = -2 / (13/-11 + 1) = -2 / (2/11) = -11`\n**3. Apply `f` again:**\n*  We now have `f(g(f(12))) = f(-11)`. Substitute `x = -11` into the expression for `f(x)`:\n   *  `f(-11) = (1 - 11) / (1 + 11) = -10 / 12 = -5/6`\n**4. Continue the pattern:**\n* We need to repeat this process 7 more times, alternating between `f` and `g`.  Notice that each time we apply `g`, the result is a simple negative integer.  This means we only need to track the denominator when applying `f`.\n**5. Keeping track of the denominator:**\n* After applying `g`, the denominator is -11.\n* After applying `f`, the denominator becomes -11 + 1 = -10.\n* After applying `g`, the denominator becomes -10 + 1 = -9.\n* After applying `f`, the denominator becomes -9 + 1 = -8.\n* After applying `g`, the denominator becomes -8 + 1 = -7.\n* After applying `f`, the denominator becomes -7 + 1 = -6.\n* After applying `g`, the denominator becomes -6 + 1 = -5.\n* After applying `f`, the denominator becomes -5 + 1 = -4.\n**6. Final Result:**\n* After applying `f` for the 8th time, we have a denominator of -4.  Since the numerator will always be 1 minus this denominator, the final result is:\n   *  `g(f(g(f(...g(f(12))...)))) = (1 - (-4)) / (-4) = 5 / -4 = -5/4`\n**Therefore, the value of the expression is -5/4.** \n",
