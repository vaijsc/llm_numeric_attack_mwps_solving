        "Here's how to compute the square of 9997 without a calculator:\n**Understanding the Pattern**\n*  9997 is very close to 10000.  We can use this fact to our advantage.\n*  Think of 9997 as (10000 - 3).\n**The Calculation**\n1. **Square the first term:**  10000\u00b2 = 100,000,000\n2. **Double the product of the two terms:** 2 * 10000 * 3 = 60,000\n3. **Square the second term:** 3\u00b2 = 9\n**Putting it together**\n*  (10000 - 3)\u00b2 = 100,000,000 - 60,000 + 9 \n*  Therefore, 9997\u00b2 = 99,940,009\n**Explanation**\nThis method uses the algebraic identity: (a - b)\u00b2 = a\u00b2 - 2ab + b\u00b2 \nWe've essentially expanded the square of (10000 - 3) using this identity. \n",
