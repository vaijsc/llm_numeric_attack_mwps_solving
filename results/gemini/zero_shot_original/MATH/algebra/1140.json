    "solution": "We rewrite the equation of the parabola as $y=a(x-h)^2+k$, where $a$, $h$, and $k$ are constants and $(h,k)$ are the coordinates of the vertex. If the parabola has a vertical line of symmetry at $x=2$, then the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $x=2$, so $h=2$. The equation of the parabola becomes $y=a(x-2)^2+k$. Plugging in the two given points into this equation, we have the two equations \\begin{align*}\n1&=a(1-2)^2+k \\Rightarrow 1=a+k\\\\\n-1&=a(4-2)^2+k \\Rightarrow -1=4a+k\n\\end{align*} Subtracting the first equation from the second yields $-2=3a$, so $a=-2/3$. Plugging this value into the first equation to solve for $k$, we find that $k=5/3$. So the equation of the parabola is $y=-\\frac{2}{3}(x-2)^2+\\frac{5}{3}$. To find the zeros of the parabola, we set $y=0$ and solve for $x$: \\begin{align*}\n0&=-\\frac{2}{3}(x-2)^2+\\frac{5}{3}\\\\\n\\frac{2}{3}(x-2)^2 &= \\frac{5}{3}\\\\\n(x-2)^2 &= \\frac{5}{2}\\\\\nx &= \\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{5}{2}}+2\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe greater zero is at $x=\\sqrt{\\frac{5}{2}}+2$, so $n=\\boxed{2.5}$.

        "Here's a step-by-step solution:\n**1. Using the Line of Symmetry**\nSince the parabola has a line of symmetry at *x* = 2, the *x*-coordinate of the vertex is 2.  The vertex form of a parabola is:\n  *y = a(x - h)^2 + k* \nwhere (h, k) is the vertex.  Substituting *h* = 2, we get:\n  *y = a(x - 2)^2 + k*\n**2. Using the Points (1, 1) and (4, -1)**\nWe can substitute the points (1, 1) and (4, -1) into the equation to get two equations:\n*  1 = a(1 - 2)^2 + k\n*  -1 = a(4 - 2)^2 + k\nSimplifying these equations, we get:\n*  1 = a + k \n*  -1 = 4a + k\n**3.

Finding the Equation of the Parabola**\nNow we have the equation of the parabola:\n*  y = (-2/3)(x - 2)^2 + 5/3\n**5. Finding the Roots**\nTo find the roots, we set *y* = 0 and solve for *x*:\n* 0 = (-2/3)(x - 2)^2 + 5/3\n* (2/3)(x - 2)^2 = 5/3\n* (x - 2)^2 = 5/2\n* x - 2 = \u00b1\u221a(5/2)\n* x = 2 \u00b1 \u221a(5/2)\n**6. Identifying the Greater Root**\nThe greater root is:\n* x = 2 + \u221a(5/2) \n**7. Determining the Value of *n***\nWe are given that the greater root is \u221a*n* + 2.  Comparing this to our result, we see that:\n* \u221a*n* = \u221a(5/2)\n* *n* = 5/2\nTherefore, **n = 5/2**. \n",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Using the line of symmetry:**\n* The line of symmetry for a parabola in the form  y = ax\u00b2 + bx + c is given by x = -b/(2a).\n* We know the line of symmetry is x = 2, so -b/(2a) = 2.  \n* This simplifies to b = -4a.\n**2. Using the points:**\n* Since the parabola passes through (1, 1), we can substitute these values into the equation: 1 = a(1)\u00b2 + b(1) + c. This simplifies to a + b + c = 1.\n* Similarly, since the parabola passes through (4, -1), we have: -1 = a(4)\u00b2 + b(4) + c. This simplifies to 16a + 4b + c = -1.\n**3. Solving the system of equations:**\n* We now have three equations with three unknowns:\n    * b = -4a\n    * a + b + c = 1\n    * 16a + 4b + c = -1\n* Substitute b = -4a into the second and third equations:\n    * a - 4a + c = 1  =>  -3a + c = 1\n    * 16a - 16a + c = -1  =>  c = -1\n* Substitute c = -1 into the equation -3a + c = 1:\n    * -3a - 1 = 1  =>  -3a = 2  =>  a = -2/3\n* Substitute a = -2/3 into b = -4a:\n    * b = -4(-2/3) = 8/3\n**4. Finding the quadratic:**\n* We now have a = -2/3, b = 8/3, and c = -1.  The quadratic equation is:\n    * y = (-2/3)x\u00b2 + (8/3)x - 1\n**5. Finding the roots:**\n* To find the roots, we need to solve the equation (-2/3)x\u00b2 + (8/3)x - 1 = 0.\n* We can multiply both sides by -3/2 to get x\u00b2 - 4x + 3/2 = 0.\n* Using the quadratic formula, we get:\n    * x = [4 \u00b1 \u221a(16 - 4 * 1 * (3/2))] / 2 \n    * x = [4 \u00b1 \u221a10] / 2\n    * x = 2 \u00b1 \u221a(10)/2\n**6.
