        "Here's how to solve this problem step by step:\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n* We have a function f(x) = x\u00b2 defined only for a finite set of x values.\n* The range of this function is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. This means these are the only possible output values of the function.\n**2. Find the Possible Input Values**\n* To get an output of 0, the input must be 0 (since 0\u00b2 = 0).\n* To get an output of 1, the input must be 1 (since 1\u00b2 = 1).\n* To get an output of 2, the input must be \u221a2 or -\u221a2 (since (\u221a2)\u00b2 = 2 and (-\u221a2)\u00b2 = 2).\n* Continue this pattern for each output value in the range.\n**3. Count the Input Values**\nNotice that for each output value in the range, there will be at most *two* possible input values (except for 0, which has only one input).\n* 0:  1 input (0)\n* 1:  1 input (1)\n* 2:  2 inputs (\u221a2, -\u221a2)\n* 3:  2 inputs (\u221a3, -\u221a3)\n* 4:  2 inputs (2, -2)\n* 5:  2 inputs (\u221a5, -\u221a5)\n* 6:  2 inputs (\u221a6, -\u221a6)\n* 7:  2 inputs (\u221a7, -\u221a7)\n* 8:  2 inputs (\u221a8, -\u221a8)\n* 9:  2 inputs (3, -3)\n**4. Calculate the Maximum Domain Size**\nAdding up the possible input values, we get: 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = **19**\n**Answer:** The maximum number of points that could be in the domain of the function is **19**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Understand the Function:**\n*  The function is  f(x) = x\u00b2  which means it squares the input value (x) to give the output.\n**2. Analyze the Range:**\n* The range of the function is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. This means that the output of the function can only be one of these values.\n**3. Find the Corresponding Input Values:**\n* To get these outputs, we need to figure out what input values (x) would produce them:\n    * 0 = 0\u00b2 \n    * 1 = 1\u00b2\n    * 2 = \u221a2\u00b2 \n    * 3 = \u221a3\u00b2\n    * 4 = 2\u00b2\n    * 5 = \u221a5\u00b2\n    * 6 = \u221a6\u00b2\n    * 7 = \u221a7\u00b2\n    * 8 = \u221a8\u00b2\n    * 9 = 3\u00b2\n**4. Count the Unique Input Values:**\n* Notice that some input values (like \u221a2, \u221a3, etc.) produce the same output as their squares.  We only need to count each input value once. \n* We have the following distinct input values: 0, 1, \u221a2, \u221a3, 2, \u221a5, \u221a6, \u221a7, \u221a8, and 3.\n**5. Maximum Domain Size:**\n* The maximum number of points in the domain is the number of distinct input values that produce the given range.  \n* Therefore, the maximum number of points in the domain is **10**. \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem:\n**Understanding the Problem**\n* **Domain:** The set of all possible input values for the function.\n* **Range:** The set of all possible output values for the function.\n* **Function:**  A rule that assigns each input value in the domain to exactly one output value in the range.\n**Solving the Problem**\n1. **Analyze the Range:** The range of the function is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.  These are all perfect squares.\n2. **Find the Square Roots:**  Since the function is  f(x) = x\u00b2, we need to find the square roots of the numbers in the range:\n   * \u221a0 = 0\n   * \u221a1 = 1\n   * \u221a2 =  (not a whole number)\n   * \u221a3 =  (not a whole number)\n   * \u221a4 = 2\n   * \u221a5 =  (not a whole number)\n   * \u221a6 =  (not a whole number)\n   * \u221a7 =  (not a whole number)\n   * \u221a8 =  (not a whole number)\n   * \u221a9 = 3\n3. **Identify the Domain:** The only possible values in the domain are the whole numbers whose squares are in the range.  Therefore, the domain must be a subset of {0, 1, 2, 3}.\n4. **Maximum Size:** To maximize the number of points in the domain, we should include all these values.  Therefore, the maximum number of points in the domain is **4**. \n**Conclusion**\nThe maximum number of points that could be in Lana's function's domain is **4**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\n* We have a function  *f(x) = x\u00b2*.\n* Lana defines this function only for a specific, finite set of *x* values (the domain).\n* The range of the function is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.\n**2. Finding the Domain Points**\n* **Think about the squares:** The range consists of perfect squares. \n* **Match the squares:** \n    * 0 = 0\u00b2\n    * 1 = 1\u00b2\n    * 2 = (\u221a2)\u00b2 (We'll ignore this since we need integer values in the domain)\n    * 3 = (\u221a3)\u00b2 (Ignore)\n    * 4 = 2\u00b2\n    * 5 = (\u221a5)\u00b2 (Ignore)\n    * 6 = (\u221a6)\u00b2 (Ignore)\n    * 7 = (\u221a7)\u00b2 (Ignore)\n    * 8 = (\u221a8)\u00b2 (Ignore)\n    * 9 = 3\u00b2\n**3. Determining the Maximum Domain Size**\n* We can see that the domain must include the following values:\n    * x = 0\n    * x = 1\n    * x = 2\n    * x = 3\n* Since we can only use integer values in the domain, and we have used all the integer values that lead to the range given, we cannot add any more points to the domain. \n**4. The Answer**\nTherefore, the maximum number of points that could be in the domain is **4**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n* Lana's function is a simple squaring function, but it's only defined for a limited set of input values (the domain).\n* We know the function's output values (the range) are the perfect squares from 0 to 9.\n**2. Find the Inputs that Produce the Output**\n*  To get the output 0, the input must be 0 (since 0\u00b2 = 0).\n*  To get the output 1, the input must be 1 (since 1\u00b2 = 1).\n*  To get the output 2, there's no integer input that works (since 1\u00b2 = 1 and 2\u00b2 = 4).\n*  To get the output 3, there's no integer input that works.\n*  To get the output 4, the input must be 2 (since 2\u00b2 = 4).\n*  To get the output 5, there's no integer input that works.\n*  To get the output 6, there's no integer input that works.\n*  To get the output 7, there's no integer input that works.\n*  To get the output 8, there's no integer input that works.\n*  To get the output 9, the input must be 3 (since 3\u00b2 = 9).\n**3. Determine the Maximum Domain Size**\n* We found that only the inputs 0, 1, 2, and 3 produce the desired outputs. \n**Answer:** Therefore, the maximum number of points in the domain of Lana's function is **4**. \n"
