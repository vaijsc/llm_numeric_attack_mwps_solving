        "Here's how to solve the equation step-by-step:\n1. **Factor out a common term:** Notice that both terms in the numerator have a common factor of  $17^5$.  We can factor this out:\n   (17^6 - 17^5) / 16 = (17^5 * (17 - 1)) / 16\n2. **Simplify:** \n   (17^5 * 16) / 16 = 17^5\n3. **Match the exponents:** Now we see that the left side of the equation is equal to 17^5. Since the right side is 17^x, we know that:\n   x = 5\n**Therefore, the value of x is 5.** \n",
