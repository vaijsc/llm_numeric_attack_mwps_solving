Expand  g(x) = f(x + 1)**\nSubstitute (x + 1) for x in the expression for f(x):\n```\ng(x) = f(x + 1) = (x + 1)^7 - 3(x + 1)^3 + 2\n```\n**2.  Expand the Powers**\nWe need to expand the powers using the binomial theorem or by direct multiplication.

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Expand g(x)**\nWe're given that  g(x) = f(x + 1).  To find g(x), we substitute (x + 1) for *x* in the expression for *f(x)*:\n```\ng(x) = (x + 1)^7 - 3(x + 1)^3 + 2 \n```\n**2.  Simplify the expression**\nExpanding the powers of (x + 1) would be tedious.  However, we don't actually need the full expanded form of g(x).  We only need the sum of its coefficients. \n**3.  Focus on the coefficients**\n* **Key Idea:**  The sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is equal to the value of the polynomial when *x* = 1. \nLet's apply this to our problem:\n* The sum of the coefficients of *g(x)* is equal to *g*(1). \n**4.

Expand the powers:**\nWe can expand the powers using the Binomial Theorem or by direct multiplication.  Here's the expansion using the Binomial Theorem:\n*  (x + 1)^7 = x^7 + 7x^6 + 21x^5 + 35x^4 + 35x^3 + 21x^2 + 7x + 1\n*  (x + 1)^3 = x^3 + 3x^2 + 3x + 1\n**3.

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Transformation**\nThe function *g(x)* is defined as *f(x + 1)*. This means we take the function *f(x)* and shift it one unit to the left on the x-axis.  \n**2. Expand g(x)**\nLet's substitute (x + 1) into *f(x)*:\n```\ng(x) = f(x + 1) = (x + 1)^7 - 3(x + 1)^3 + 2 \n```\nExpanding this would be quite tedious, but we don't need the full expansion! We only need the sum of the coefficients.\n**3. The Key Insight**\nThe sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is equal to the value of the polynomial when *x* = 1. This is because when you plug in *x* = 1, each term in the polynomial becomes its coefficient. \n**4. Calculate the Sum of Coefficients**\nTherefore, to find the sum of the coefficients of *g(x)*, we just need to evaluate *g(1)*:\n```\ng(1) = (1 + 1)^7 - 3(1 + 1)^3 + 2 = 2^7 - 3(2^3) + 2 = 128 - 24 + 2 = 106\n```\n**Answer:** The sum of the coefficients of *g(x)* is **106**. \n",
