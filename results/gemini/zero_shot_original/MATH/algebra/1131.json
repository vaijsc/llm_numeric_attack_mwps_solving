        "Here's how to find the midpoint:\n**1.  Midpoint Formula:**\nThe midpoint of a line segment with endpoints  (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is found using the following formula:\n   Midpoint =  ((x1 + x2)/2, (y1 + y2)/2)\n**2.  Apply the Formula:**\n*  Let (-5, 5) be (x1, y1)\n*  Let (3, 7) be (x2, y2)\n   Midpoint = ((-5 + 3)/2, (5 + 7)/2)\n**3.  Simplify:**\n   Midpoint = (-2/2, 12/2)\n   Midpoint = (-1, 6)\n**Therefore, the midpoint of the line segment is (-1, 6).** \n",
