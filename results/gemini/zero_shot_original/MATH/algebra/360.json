        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understanding the Discriminant**\nA quadratic equation of the form *ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0* has two real roots if and only if its discriminant (\u0394) is positive. The discriminant is calculated as:\n\u0394 = b\u00b2 - 4ac\n**2. Applying the Discriminant to Our Problem**\nIn our equation, *3x\u00b2 + 7x + c = 0*, we have:\n* a = 3\n* b = 7\n* c = c (the unknown we need to find)\nSo, the discriminant is:\n\u0394 = 7\u00b2 - 4 * 3 * c = 49 - 12c\n**3. Setting the Discriminant Greater Than Zero**\nFor the quadratic to have two real roots, the discriminant must be positive:\n49 - 12c > 0\n**4. Solving the Inequality**\n* Subtract 49 from both sides: -12c > -49\n* Divide both sides by -12 (remember to flip the inequality sign when dividing by a negative number): c < 49/12\n**5. Finding the Positive Integer Solutions**\nThe inequality c < 49/12 tells us that *c* can be any positive integer less than 49/12. The largest integer that satisfies this condition is 4. \n**6. Finding the Product**\nThe positive integer values of *c* that satisfy the condition are 1, 2, 3, and 4. Their product is:\n1 * 2 * 3 * 4 = **24**\n**Therefore, the product of all positive integer values of *c* that make the equation have two real roots is 24.** \n",
