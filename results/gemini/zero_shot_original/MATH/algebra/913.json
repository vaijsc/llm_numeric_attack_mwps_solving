    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Instead of representing the quotient as $1\\Delta$, we will represent it as $10 + \\Delta$. Our equation becomes $144/\\Delta = 10 + \\Delta$. Multiplying both sides by $\\Delta$, we have a quadratic: $144 = 10\\cdot\\Delta + \\Delta^2$. Rearranging the terms, we have $\\Delta^2 + 10\\cdot\\Delta - 144 = 0$. We can now factor this quadratic as $(\\Delta + 18)(\\Delta - 8) = 0$ or use the quadratic formula: $\\Delta = \\dfrac{-10 \\pm \\sqrt{10^2 - 4(1)(-144)}}{2} = -18 \\text{ or } 8$.\n\nSince $\\Delta$ is a digit, $\\Delta \\not = -18$. Therefore, $\\Delta = \\boxed{8}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n1. **Understanding the Equation:** The equation $144 / \\Delta = 1\\Delta$ tells us that when we divide 144 by a single digit represented by  $\\Delta$, we get a two-digit quotient where the tens digit is 1 and the ones digit is also $\\Delta$.\n2. **Estimating:**  Since 144 divided by a single digit will result in a number between 10 and 19 (because the tens digit is 1), we know $\\Delta$ must be a number that, when multiplied by 1, results in a product less than 14.\n3. **Trial and Error:** Let's try different values for $\\Delta$:\n   * If $\\Delta = 1$, then $144/1 = 144$, which doesn't fit the pattern.\n   * If $\\Delta = 2$, then $144/2 = 72$, which doesn't fit the pattern.\n   * If $\\Delta = 3$, then $144/3 = 48$, which doesn't fit the pattern.\n   * If $\\Delta = 4$, then $144/4 = 36$, which doesn't fit the pattern.\n   * If $\\Delta = 5$, then $144/5 = 28.8$, which doesn't fit the pattern.\n   * If $\\Delta = 6$, then $144/6 = 24$, which doesn't fit the pattern.\n   * If $\\Delta = 7$, then $144/7 = 20.57...$, which doesn't fit the pattern.\n   * If $\\Delta = 8$, then $144/8 = 18$, which fits the pattern!\n4. **Solution:** Therefore, the digit represented by $\\Delta$ is **8**. \n",
