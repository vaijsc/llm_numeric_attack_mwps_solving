        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Identify the issue:**\nThe expression is a fraction, and fractions are undefined when the denominator is zero. \n**2. Find the values that make the denominator zero:**\nWe need to solve the equation: \n  *  x\u00b2 - 9 = 0\n**3. Factor the denominator:**\nThis equation factors as a difference of squares:\n  * (x + 3)(x - 3) = 0\n**4. Solve for x:**\nFor the product of two factors to be zero, at least one of the factors must be zero.  So we have two possibilities:\n  * x + 3 = 0  =>  x = -3\n  * x - 3 = 0  =>  x = 3\n**5. Answer:**\nThe expression is undefined for **two** values of *x*:  x = -3 and x = 3. \n",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Problem**\nThe expression is a fraction. Fractions are undefined when the denominator is zero.  Our goal is to find the values of *x* that make the denominator zero.\n**2. Factor the Denominator**\nThe denominator is a difference of squares:  \n*x\u00b2 - 9 = (x + 3)(x - 3)*\n**3. Find the Values that Make the Denominator Zero**\nFor the denominator to be zero, one or both of the factors must be zero.  This occurs when:\n*  *x + 3 = 0*  (Solving for *x* gives *x = -3*)\n*  *x - 3 = 0*  (Solving for *x* gives *x = 3*)\n**4.

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand what makes an expression undefined**\nA fraction is undefined when its denominator is equal to zero. This is because division by zero is not defined in mathematics.\n**2. Find the values that make the denominator zero**\nThe denominator of our expression is $x^2 - 9$. We need to find the values of *x* that make this expression equal to zero:\n*  Factor the denominator:  $x^2 - 9 = (x + 3)(x - 3)$\n*  Set each factor equal to zero and solve:\n    *  $x + 3 = 0  \\Rightarrow x = -3$\n    *  $x - 3 = 0  \\Rightarrow x = 3$\n**3. The answer**\nWe found that the expression is undefined for *x = -3* and *x = 3*.  Therefore, the expression is not defined for **two** values of *x*. \n",
