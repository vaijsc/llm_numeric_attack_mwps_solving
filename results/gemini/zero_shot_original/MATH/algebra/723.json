        "Here's how we can solve this problem:\n**1. Identify Key Features**\n* **Vertical Asymptote:** The graph has a vertical asymptote at *x* = 2.

This means the degree of the numerator and denominator are the same, and the ratio of their leading coefficients is -1.\n**2. Analyze the Equation**\n* **Vertical Asymptote:** For the denominator to be zero at *x* = 2, we need *Bx + C* = 0 when *x* = 2. This gives us the equation 2*B + C = 0.\n* **Horizontal Asymptote:** Since the degree of the numerator and denominator are the same, we need the leading coefficient of the numerator to be the negative of the leading coefficient of the denominator. This means *B* = -1.\n**3. Solve the System**\nNow we have a system of two equations:\n* 2*B + C = 0\n* B = -1\nSubstituting *B* = -1 into the first equation, we get:\n* 2(-1) + C = 0\n* C = 2\n**4. Calculate A + B + C**\nFinally, we can calculate the value of A + B + C:\n* A + B + C = A - 1 + 2 \nWe still need to find the value of *A*.  Notice that the graph passes through the point (0, 2).

The leading coefficient of the denominator is *B*. So, -1/*B* = -1.  This tells us *B* = 1.\n* **Y-intercept:**  When *x* = 0, *y* = 2.
