    "solution": "First, we note that $x$ must be nonnegative, since $\\sqrt{12x}$ is undefined if $x<0$.  Then, we simplify both sides of the equation.  Expanding the product on the left gives \\begin{align*}\n(\\sqrt{12x} + 12)(\\sqrt{3x} - 6) &= \\sqrt{12x}(\\sqrt{3x} - 6) + 12(\\sqrt{3x} - 6)\\\\\n&= \\sqrt{36x^2} - 6\\sqrt{12x} + 12\\sqrt{3x} - 72.\n\\end{align*}Next, we notice that since $x>0$, we have $\\sqrt{36x^2} = 6x$.  Also, we have $\\sqrt{12x} = \\sqrt{4\\cdot 3 x} = 2\\sqrt{3x}$, so  \\[\\sqrt{36x^2} - 6\\sqrt{12x} + 12\\sqrt{3x} - 72 = 6x -6(2\\sqrt{3x}) + 12\\sqrt{3x} - 72 = 6x- 72.\\]Therefore, the left side of the original equation is equivalent to $6x-72$.  Simplifying the right side then gives $$6x-72=5x-22.$$Then we collect like terms, to get: $$x=\\boxed{50}.$$",

        "Here's how to solve the equation step-by-step:\n**1. Simplify both sides of the equation:**\n* **Left side:**  Expand the product using the distributive property (FOIL method):\n   ```\n   (\u221a12x + 12)(\u221a3x - 6) = \u221a(12x * 3x) - 6\u221a12x + 12\u221a3x - 72 \n                           = \u221a36x\u00b2 - 6\u221a12x + 12\u221a3x - 72\n                           = 6x - 6\u221a12x + 12\u221a3x - 72 \n   ```\n* **Right side:** Combine like terms:\n   ```\n   4(x + 3) + x - 34 = 4x + 12 + x - 34\n                        = 5x - 22 \n   ```\n**2. Now the equation looks like this:**\n   ```\n   6x - 6\u221a12x + 12\u221a3x - 72 = 5x - 22\n   ```\n**3. Isolate the radical terms:**\n* Subtract 6x and add 72 to both sides:\n   ```\n   -6\u221a12x + 12\u221a3x = -x - 50\n   ```\n**4. Simplify the radicals:**\n* \u221a12x = \u221a(4 * 3x) = 2\u221a3x\n* \u221a3x remains as \u221a3x\n**5. Substitute the simplified radicals back into the equation:**\n   ```\n   -6(2\u221a3x) + 12\u221a3x = -x - 50\n   -12\u221a3x + 12\u221a3x = -x - 50\n   ```\n**6. Solve for x:**\n* The radical terms cancel out, leaving:\n   ```\n   0 = -x - 50\n   ```\n* Add x to both sides:\n   ```\n   x = -50\n   ```\n**7. Check the solution:**\n* **Important!** Always check your solution by plugging it back into the original equation.  In this case, plugging in x = -50 results in taking the square root of a negative number, which is not allowed in the real number system.  Therefore, **there is no solution** to the equation. \n**Conclusion:** The equation has no real solutions. \n",
