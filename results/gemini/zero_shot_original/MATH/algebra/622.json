Since we're looking for *f\u207b\u00b9(0)*, we need to find the *input* to the function that gives an output of 0. \n* **Consider both cases:**\n    * **Case 1:  x \u2264 3** \n        * 3 - *x* = 0 \n        * *x* = 3\n    * **Case 2:  x > 3**\n        * -*x\u00b3* + 2*x\u00b2* + 3*x = 0\n        * This equation is a bit tricky to factor directly. Notice that *x* = 0 is a solution (but it doesn't satisfy the condition *x* > 3). We can factor out an *x* to get:\n           * *x*(-*x\u00b2* + 2*x + 3) = 0\n           * The quadratic factor can be factored further:\n             * *x*(-(*x* - 3)(*x* + 1)) = 0\n           * This gives us solutions *x* = 0, *x* = 3, and *x* = -1.  Only *x* = 3 satisfies the condition *x* > 3.\n* **Choose the correct solution:** Since both cases give us *x* = 3, this is the solution for *f\u207b\u00b9(0)*.\n**2.

We can try to factor or use numerical methods, but we can use a bit of reasoning:\n            * As *x* gets very large, the -*x\u00b3* term dominates, and the function will become increasingly negative. Since we're looking for a positive value, it's unlikely this case will give us a solution.\n* **Choose the correct solution:** The only solution that works is *x* = -3.
