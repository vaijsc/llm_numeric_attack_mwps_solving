    "problem": "The earth rotates at a constant rate and rotates 360 degrees in one day. How many degrees does it rotate in one hour?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since there are 24 hours in a day, in one hour the Earth rotates $1/24$ of the amount it rotates in a day, or $360/24=\\boxed{15}$ degrees.",

        "Here's how to solve this:\n* **Degrees in a day:** The Earth rotates 360 degrees in 24 hours.\n* **Degrees per hour:** To find out how many degrees it rotates in one hour, divide the total degrees by the number of hours: 360 degrees / 24 hours = 15 degrees/hour\n**Answer:** The Earth rotates 15 degrees in one hour. \n",
