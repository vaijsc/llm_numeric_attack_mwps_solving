        "Here's how to compute the range of the function $f(x) = \\sqrt{x^2}$:\n**1. Understanding the function:**\n* **The square root function:** The square root function, denoted by $\\sqrt{}$, always returns a non-negative value. This means that for any input, the output of $\\sqrt{}$ will be zero or positive.\n* **The square of a number:** Squaring a number always results in a non-negative value (positive or zero).\n**2. Analyzing the function:**\n* **Simplifying:**  Since the square root of a square is the original number (for non-negative values), we can simplify the function: \n   * For $x \\ge 0$,  $f(x) = \\sqrt{x^2} = x$\n   * For $x < 0$,  $f(x) = \\sqrt{x^2} = -x$ (because the square root always gives a non-negative result)\n**3. Determining the range:**\n*  In both cases (positive and negative x), the output of the function is always non-negative. \n*  Since we can obtain any non-negative value by choosing an appropriate x, the range of the function is all non-negative real numbers.\n**4. Writing the range in interval notation:**\nThe range of the function $f(x) = \\sqrt{x^2}$ is  **[0, \u221e)**. \n",
        "**1. Understand the function:**\n*  The function $f(x) = \\sqrt{x^2}$ takes any real number *x*, squares it, and then takes the square root.\n**2. Analyze the properties:**\n* **Squaring:**  Squaring a number always results in a non-negative value (0 or positive).\n* **Square root:**  The square root of a non-negative number is always non-negative.\n**3. Determine the range:**\n* Since we start with a non-negative number (after squaring) and then take its square root, the output of the function will always be non-negative. \n*  Moreover, any non-negative number can be obtained as the square root of its square. \n**4. Conclusion:**\nThe range of the function $f(x) = \\sqrt{x^2}$ is **all non-negative real numbers**, which can be written as **[0, \u221e)**. \n",
