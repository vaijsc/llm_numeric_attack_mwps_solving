    "solution": "We look for the least number of widgets $n$ such that the cost is less than the revenue. \\begin{align*}\n1000+.5n&<2.75n\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n1000&<2.25n\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n444.\\overline{4}=\\frac{1000}{2.25}&<n.\n\\end{align*}The smallest integer greater than $444.\\overline{4}$ is 445, so the company has to sell at least $\\boxed{445}$ widgets to make a profit.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Determine the profit per widget:**\n* Selling price per widget: $2.75\n* Cost to make each widget: $0.50\n* Profit per widget: $2.75 - $0.50 = $2.25\n**2. Calculate the total cost to break even:**\n* The company needs to make enough profit to cover the $1000 equipment fee.\n**3. Find the number of widgets needed to break even:**\n* Divide the total cost by the profit per widget: $1000 / $2.25 = 444.44\n**4. Round up to the nearest whole number:**\n* Since the company can't sell a fraction of a widget, they need to sell **445 widgets** to break even and start making a profit. \n",

Calculate the total cost to break even:**\n* The company needs to cover the equipment fee of $1000 and the cost of making widgets to break even.\n* Let 'x' be the number of widgets needed to break even.\n* Total cost = $1000 (equipment fee) + $0.50x (cost of making widgets)\n**3. Set up an equation to find the break-even point:**\n* Total revenue = Total cost\n* $2.75x = $1000 + $0.50x\n**4. Solve for x:**\n* Subtract $0.50x from both sides: $2.25x = $1000\n* Divide both sides by $2.25: x \u2248 444.44\n**5. Determine the least number of widgets to make a profit:**\n* Since the company can't sell a fraction of a widget, they need to sell at least **445 widgets** to make a profit. \n",
