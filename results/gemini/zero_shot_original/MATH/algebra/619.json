        "Here's how to find the length of the segment:\n**1. Understand the Distance Formula**\nThe distance formula is derived from the Pythagorean theorem and helps us calculate the distance between two points in a coordinate plane. It states:\nDistance = \u221a[(x\u2082 - x\u2081)\u00b2 + (y\u2082 - y\u2081)\u00b2]\n**2. Identify the Coordinates**\n*  Let (x\u2081, y\u2081) be (1, 2)\n*  Let (x\u2082, y\u2082) be (-4, -10)\n**3. Substitute the Values into the Formula**\nDistance = \u221a[(-4 - 1)\u00b2 + (-10 - 2)\u00b2]\n**4. Simplify the Equation**\nDistance = \u221a[(-5)\u00b2 + (-12)\u00b2]\nDistance = \u221a(25 + 144)\nDistance = \u221a169\n**5. Calculate the Final Result**\nDistance = 13\n**Therefore, the segment is 13 units long.** \n",
