    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let the side lengths of the rectangle be $a$ and $b$ with $a\\leq b$. Then $ab=10(a+b).$ Expanding and moving all the terms to the left hand side gives $ab-10a-10b=0.$ We apply Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick and add $100$ to both sides to allow us to factor the left hand side: $$ab-10a-10b+100 = (a-10)(b-10)=100$$From this, we know that $(a-10,b-10)$ must be a pair of factors of $100$. Consequently, the pairs $(a,b)$ that provide different areas are $(11,110),$ $(12, 60),$ $(14, 35),$ $(15, 30),$ and $(20,20)$. There are therefore $\\boxed{5}$ distinct rectangles with the desired property.",

        "Let the length of the rectangle be $l$ units and the width be $w$ units.  We are given that $lw = 5(2l + 2w)$.  Simplifying, we get $lw = 10l + 10w$, or $lw - 10l - 10w = 0$.  Adding 100 to both sides, we get $lw - 10l - 10w + 100 = 100$, which factors as $(l - 10)(w - 10) = 100$.  Since $l$ and $w$ are integers, we must have $l - 10$ and $w - 10$ both integers.  Thus, we need to find all the pairs of integers $(l - 10, w - 10)$ that multiply to 100.  These pairs are $(1, 100)$, $(2, 50)$, $(4, 25)$, $(5, 20)$, $(10, 10)$, $(20, 5)$, $(25, 4)$, $(50, 2)$, and $(100, 1)$.  Since we are looking for distinct rectangles, we must count each pair twice (once for each possible orientation of the rectangle).  Therefore, there are a total of $\\boxed{18}$ distinct rectangles. \n",
        "Let the length of the rectangle be $l$ units and the width be $w$ units.
