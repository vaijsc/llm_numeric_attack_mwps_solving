        "Here's how to find the minimum value of y:\n**Understanding the Equation**\nThe equation  *y = x\u00b2 - 7* represents a parabola that opens upwards. This is because the coefficient of the *x\u00b2* term is positive. \n**Finding the Minimum**\n* **Vertex:** The minimum value of a parabola that opens upwards occurs at its vertex. The x-coordinate of the vertex is given by -b/2a, where 'a' and 'b' are the coefficients of the quadratic equation (in this case, a = 1 and b = 0).\n* **Calculating the Vertex:**\n   - x-coordinate of vertex: -0 / (2 * 1) = 0\n* **Finding the Minimum Value:** Substitute the x-coordinate of the vertex (x = 0) back into the original equation to find the corresponding y-value:\n   - y = (0)\u00b2 - 7 = -7\n**Answer:**\nThe minimum value possible for y is **-7**. \n",

        "Here's how to find the minimum value of y:\n**Understanding the Equation**\nThe equation *y = x\u00b2 - 7* represents a parabola that opens upwards.  This is because the coefficient of the x\u00b2 term is positive.  The vertex of the parabola is the lowest point.\n**Finding the Vertex**\n* **Method 1: Completing the Square**\n   1. Rewrite the equation:  *y = (x\u00b2 - 7)* \n   2. To complete the square, take half of the coefficient of the x term (which is 0), square it (0\u00b2 = 0), and add and subtract it inside the parentheses:  *y = (x\u00b2 + 0 - 7 + 0)*\n   3. Now we can rewrite the expression in parentheses as a squared term: *y = (x + 0)\u00b2 - 7*\n   4. The vertex of the parabola is at the point (-0, -7).\n* **Method 2: Using the Vertex Formula**\n    The x-coordinate of the vertex of a parabola in the form *y = ax\u00b2 + bx + c* is given by:  *x = -b / 2a*\n    In our case, a = 1 and b = 0, so the x-coordinate of the vertex is: *x = -0 / (2 * 1) = 0*\n    Substitute x = 0 back into the original equation to find the y-coordinate of the vertex: *y = 0\u00b2 - 7 = -7*\n**Conclusion**\nSince the parabola opens upwards, the vertex is the minimum point. Therefore, the minimum value possible for *y* is **-7**. \n",
