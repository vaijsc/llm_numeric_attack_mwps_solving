    "solution": "We rearrange our equation: $x^2 - 7x + 1 = 0$. Then, we use the quadratic equation to solve for $x$: $$x = \\frac{7\\pm\\sqrt{(-7)^2-(4)(1)(1)}}{2} = \\frac{7\\pm 3\\sqrt{5}}{2}.$$ The two possible values of $x$ are reciprocals of each other. Here's why: \\begin{align*}\\frac{1}{(7+3\\sqrt{5})/2} &= \\frac{2}{7+3\\sqrt{5}}\\\\\n&=\\frac{2}{7+3\\sqrt{5}}\\cdot\\frac{7-3\\sqrt{5}}{7-3\\sqrt{5}} \\\\\n&=\\frac{2(7-3\\sqrt{5})}{7^2 - (3\\sqrt{5})^2} = \\frac{2(7-3\\sqrt{5})}{4} = \\frac{7-3\\sqrt{5}}{2}.\n\\end{align*}\n\nThus, our answer is $$\\frac{7 + 3\\sqrt{5}}{2} + \\frac{7 - 3\\sqrt{5}}{2} = \\boxed{7}.$$\n\n- OR -\n\nWe want the sum of $x$ and its reciprocal.

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Rearrange the equation:**\n* Subtract 7x from both sides to get a quadratic equation: \n   x\u00b2 - 7x + 1 = 0\n**2. Find the sum of the roots:**\n* For a quadratic equation in the form ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0, the sum of the roots is given by -b/a. \n* In our equation, a = 1 and b = -7.\n* Therefore, the sum of the roots is -(-7)/1 = 7.\n**3. Recognize the relationship:**\n* The sum of a number (x) and its reciprocal (1/x) is:  x + (1/x) \n**4. Consider the equation's roots:**\n* Since x is a solution to the quadratic equation, it is one of the roots.  Let's call the other root y.\n* We know that x + y = 7 (from step 2).\n**5. The answer:**\n*  The sum of x and its reciprocal is x + (1/x).  We don't know the value of x, but we know x + y = 7. \n* We cannot directly calculate x + (1/x) without knowing the specific value of x. \n**Therefore, we cannot determine the sum of x and its reciprocal without knowing the specific solution x to the equation.** \n",
