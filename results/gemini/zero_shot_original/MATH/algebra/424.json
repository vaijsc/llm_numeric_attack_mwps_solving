    "solution": "The slopes of perpendicular lines are negative reciprocals. Therefore, the slope of line $b$ is the negative reciprocal of $-2$, which is $\\frac12$. The slopes of parallel lines are the same, therefore the slope of line $a$ is also $\\frac12$. Using the point-slope formula, the equation of line $a$ is $y-2=\\frac12(x-1)$. Changing the form to slope-intercept, we get the equation $y=\\frac{x}{2}+\\frac32$. Therefore, the y-intercept is $\\boxed{\\frac32}$.",
