Thus, we want to find the sum of the arithmetic series $102 + 105 + \\dots + 198$.\n\nThe $n^{\\text{th}}$ term in this arithmetic sequence is $102 + 3(n - 1) = 3n + 99$.  If $3n + 99 = 198$, then $n = 33$, so the number of terms in this sequence is 33.\n\nThe sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, so the sum is $(102 + 198)/2 \\cdot 33 = \\boxed{4950}.$",

        "Here's how to find the sum of all multiples of 3 between 100 and 200:\n**1. Identify the first and last multiples:**\n* The first multiple of 3 greater than 100 is 102 (3 x 34).\n* The last multiple of 3 less than 200 is 198 (3 x 66).\n**2. Create an arithmetic sequence:**\n* The multiples of 3 form an arithmetic sequence: 102, 105, 108, ..., 198\n* In this sequence:\n    * The first term (a) is 102\n    * The common difference (d) is 3\n    * The last term (l) is 198\n**3. Find the number of terms (n):**\n* Use the formula: l = a + (n-1)d\n* Substitute the values: 198 = 102 + (n-1)3\n* Solve for n:\n    * 96 = 3(n-1)\n    * 32 = n-1\n    * n = 33 \n**4. Apply the sum formula:**\n* The sum (S) of an arithmetic series is: S = (n/2)(a + l)\n* Substitute the values: S = (33/2)(102 + 198)\n* Calculate: S = (33/2)(300) = 4950\n**Therefore, the sum of all multiples of 3 between 100 and 200 is 4950.** \n",
