    "solution": "We use the fact that the sum and product of the roots of a quadratic equation $x^2+ax+b=0$ are given by $-a$ and $b$, respectively.\n\nIn this problem, we see that $2a+b = -a$ and $(2a)(b) = b$. From the second equation, we see that either $2a = 1$ or else $b = 0$. But if $b = 0$, then the first equation gives $2a = -a$, implying that $a = 0$. This makes the two solutions of our original polynomial the same, and we are given that they are distinct. Hence $b \\not=0$, so $2a = 1,$ or $a = 1/2$. Then $b = -3a = -3/2$, so $a+b = \\boxed{-1}$.",

Utilize the Relationship Between Roots and Coefficients**\nFor a quadratic polynomial of the form  *ax\u00b2 + bx + c*,  we have the following relationships between the roots (let's call them *r\u2081* and *r\u2082*) and the coefficients:\n* **Sum of roots:**  *r\u2081 + r\u2082 = -b/a*\n* **Product of roots:** *r\u2081 * r\u2082 = c/a*\n**2. Apply the Relationships to Our Problem**\nIn our problem, the polynomial is  *p(x) = x\u00b2 + ax + b*.  This means:\n* *a* = 1 (coefficient of the x\u00b2 term)\n* *b* = b (coefficient of the x term)\n* *c* = b (constant term)\nWe are given that the roots are *2a* and *b*.

Solve the System of Equations**\nNow we have two equations and two unknowns (a and b).  Let's solve for *a* and *b*:\n* From the first equation: 3a + b = 0 \n* From the second equation: 2ab - b = 0  =>  b(2a - 1) = 0\nSince the roots are distinct, *b* cannot be 0.  Therefore, we must have:\n* 2a - 1 = 0  =>  a = 1/2\nSubstitute *a = 1/2* into the first equation:\n* 3(1/2) + b = 0  =>  b = -3/2\n**4. Find a + b**\nFinally, we can calculate *a + b*:\n* a + b = (1/2) + (-3/2) = **-1** \n**Therefore, a + b = -1.** \n",
