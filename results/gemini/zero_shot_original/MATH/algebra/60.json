        "Here's how to find the minimum value of the quadratic expression and the x-value that gives it:\n**1. Completing the Square**\n* **Factor out a -1:**  We'll start by factoring out a -1 from the first two terms: \n   -1(x\u00b2 + 14x) + 3 \n* **Complete the square:**  To complete the square inside the parentheses, take half of the coefficient of our x term (which is 14), square it (14/2 = 7, 7\u00b2 = 49), and add and subtract it inside the parentheses:\n   -1(x\u00b2 + 14x + 49 - 49) + 3\n* **Rewrite as a squared term:**  Now we can rewrite the first three terms inside the parentheses as a squared term:\n   -1(x + 7)\u00b2 - 49 + 3\n* **Simplify:**\n   -1(x + 7)\u00b2 - 46\n**2.  Interpreting the Result**\nWe've now rewritten the expression in vertex form:  -1(x + 7)\u00b2 - 46.  Here's why this is helpful:\n* **The vertex:** The vertex of the parabola represented by this expression is at the point (-7, -46).\n* **Minimum value:** Since the coefficient of the squared term is negative (-1), the parabola opens downwards. This means the vertex represents the *minimum* point of the parabola. \n**3.  Conclusion**\nTherefore, the minimum value of the expression occurs when *x = -7*, and the minimum value itself is **-46**. \n",
        "Here's how to find the value of x that minimizes the expression, step by step:\n**1.  Recognize the Form**\nThe expression  *x\u00b2 - 14x + 3* is a quadratic expression (a polynomial with the highest power of x being 2).  Quadratic expressions have graphs that are parabolas.\n**2. Finding the Vertex**\nThe vertex of a parabola is the point where it reaches its minimum (or maximum) value.  The x-coordinate of the vertex is given by the formula:\n*  x = -b / 2a   \nWhere 'a' and 'b' are the coefficients of the quadratic expression (in the form ax\u00b2 + bx + c).\n**3. Apply the Formula**\nIn our expression, a = 1 and b = -14.  Let's plug these values into the formula:\n* x = -(-14) / (2 * 1) \n* x = 14 / 2\n* x = 7\n**4. Conclusion**\nThe value of x = 7 will give the minimum value for the expression x\u00b2 - 14x + 3. \n",
        "Here's how to find the minimum value of the quadratic expression:\n**1. Recognize the Form**\nThe expression  *x\u00b2 - 14x + 3* is a quadratic equation in the standard form *ax\u00b2 + bx + c*.  \n**2. Complete the Square**\n* **Factor out the coefficient of x\u00b2:** In this case, it's 1, so we don't need to factor anything out.\n* **Take half of the coefficient of x, square it, and add and subtract it inside the expression:** \n    * Half of -14 is -7.\n    * Squaring -7 gives 49.\n    * So we add and subtract 49: \n       *x\u00b2 - 14x + 49 - 49 + 3*\n* **Rewrite the first three terms as a perfect square trinomial:**\n    *(x\u00b2 - 14x + 49) - 49 + 3* \n    *(x - 7)\u00b2 - 46* \n**3. Analyze the Result**\nWe've now rewritten the expression as *(x - 7)\u00b2 - 46*.  Notice that:\n*  (x - 7)\u00b2 is always greater than or equal to zero, no matter what value of x we choose.\n*  Therefore, the minimum value of the expression occurs when (x - 7)\u00b2 = 0. \n**4. Find the Minimum Value**\n*  To make (x - 7)\u00b2 = 0, we need x = 7.\n*  Substituting x = 7 into the expression, we get:\n    *(7 - 7)\u00b2 - 46 = -46*\n**Conclusion**\nThe value of x that gives the minimum value for the expression is **x = 7**. The minimum value itself is **-46**. \n",
