        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Relationship**\nThe equation  \\[(x-1)\\cdot f(x)=3x^4+x^3 - 25x^2 +38x -17\\] tells us that  *f(x)* is a factor of the polynomial on the right side of the equation. In other words, if we divide the right side by *x - 1*, we'll get *f(x)*.\n**2. Use Polynomial Division**\nWe can use polynomial long division to divide  *3x\u2074 + x\u00b3 - 25x\u00b2 + 38x - 17* by *x - 1*:\n```\n          3x\u00b3 + 4x\u00b2 - 21x + 17 \n       ________________________\nx - 1 | 3x\u2074 + x\u00b3 - 25x\u00b2 + 38x - 17\n         -(3x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3)\n         -----------------\n               4x\u00b3 - 25x\u00b2\n               -(4x\u00b3 - 4x\u00b2)\n               -----------------\n                     -21x\u00b2 + 38x\n                     -(-21x\u00b2 + 21x)\n                     -----------------\n                           17x - 17\n                           -(17x - 17)\n                           -----------------\n                                  0 \n```\n**3. Determine the Degree**\nThe result of the division is *3x\u00b3 + 4x\u00b2 - 21x + 17*.  This is the polynomial *f(x)*.\n**4. Find the Degree**\nThe degree of a polynomial is the highest power of the variable. In this case, the highest power of *x* in *f(x)* is 3. \n**Answer:** The degree of *f(x)* is **3**. \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem:\n**1. Understand the relationship:**\nThe equation tells us that when we multiply the polynomial  *f(x)* by  *(x-1)*, we get the polynomial  *3x\u2074 + x\u00b3 - 25x\u00b2 + 38x - 17*.  \n**2. Degree of the product:**\nThe degree of a polynomial is the highest power of the variable. The degree of the product  *(x-1) * f(x)* is 5 (because we're multiplying a linear term, *x-1*, by a polynomial that must have degree 4 to get a degree 5 polynomial).\n**3. Degree of f(x):**\nSince the degree of *(x-1)* is 1, to get a product with degree 5, the polynomial *f(x)* must have a degree of 4 (because 1 + 4 = 5).\n**Therefore, the degree of *f(x)* is 4.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Understanding the Equation**\nThe equation  $(x-1)\\cdot f(x)=3x^4+x^3 - 25x^2 +38x -17$ tells us that when we multiply the polynomial *f(x)* by (x-1), we get the polynomial on the right side of the equation.\n**2.

Degree of (x-1)**\nThe polynomial (x-1) is a first-degree polynomial.\n**4. Degree of f(x)**\nTo get a fourth-degree polynomial (the right side) by multiplying a first-degree polynomial (x-1) with another polynomial, that other polynomial must be a third-degree polynomial.  \n**5.
