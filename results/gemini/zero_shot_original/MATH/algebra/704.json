        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the sequences:**\n* **Sequence A:** This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term is 5 and each term is 2 less than the previous one.  So the sequence looks like: 5, 3, 1, -1, -3, ...\n* **Sequence B:**  Each term of sequence B is calculated by taking 2 to the power of the corresponding term in sequence A. So, sequence B looks like: 2\u2075, 2\u00b3, 2\u00b9, 2\u207b\u00b9, 2\u207b\u00b3, ...\n**2. Express the terms of sequence B:**\nWe can write the terms of sequence B in a more general way:\n* The k-th term of sequence A is  5 - 2(k-1) = 7 - 2k\n* The k-th term of sequence B is  2^(7 - 2k)\n**3. Recognize the series:**\nSequence B actually forms a geometric series where:\n* The first term is 2\u2075 \n* The common ratio is 1/4 (each term is 1/4 of the previous term)\n**4. Use the formula for infinite geometric series:**\nThe sum of an infinite geometric series is given by:\nS = a / (1 - r)\nwhere:\n* a = the first term\n* r = the common ratio\n**5. Calculate the sum:**\nIn this case, a = 2\u2075 and r = 1/4.  Therefore:\nS = 2\u2075 / (1 - 1/4) = 32 / (3/4) = **42.6666...**\n**Therefore, the sum of all the terms of sequence B is 42.6666...** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understanding the Sequences**\n* **Sequence A:** This is an arithmetic sequence, meaning each term is found by adding a constant value (the common difference) to the previous term. \n    * First term: 5\n    * Common difference: -2\n    * The sequence looks like this: 5, 3, 1, -1, -3, ... \n* **Sequence B:**  Each term in this sequence is determined by taking a term from sequence A, raising 2 to that power.\n    * The first term of B is 2^(the first term of A) = 2^5 = 32.\n    * The second term of B is 2^(the second term of A) = 2^3 = 8.\n    * The sequence looks like this: 32, 8, 2, 1/2, 1/8, ...\n**2. Finding the Sum of Sequence B**\nThe key here is to recognize that sequence B forms a geometric sequence.

Infinite Geometric Series**\nSince sequence B is an infinite geometric series, we can use the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series:\n* **Sum (S) = a / (1 - r)**  \n   Where:\n    * a = first term\n    * r = common ratio\n**4. Calculation**\nPlugging in the values for sequence B:\n* S = 32 / (1 - 1/4) \n* S = 32 / (3/4)\n* S = (32 * 4) / 3\n* S = 128/3\n**Therefore, the sum of all the terms of sequence B is 128/3.** \n",

Recognizing the Pattern in Sequence B**\nNotice that sequence B consists of powers of 2, with exponents that decrease by 2 each time.  This pattern makes it easier to calculate the sum.\n**3. Using the Geometric Series Formula**\nSequence B is a geometric sequence with:\n* First term (a) = 2\u2075 = 32\n* Common ratio (r) = 1/4 (because each term is 1/4 of the previous term)\nThe sum of an infinite geometric series is given by: \nS = a / (1 - r)  \n**4.

Using the Infinite Geometric Series Formula:**\nThe sum of an infinite geometric series is given by:\nS = a / (1 - r)  (where |r| < 1)\nSince the absolute value of our common ratio (|-1/4|) is less than 1, we can use this formula:\nS = 32 / (1 - (-1/4)) = 32 / (5/4) = **25.6**\n**Therefore, the sum of all the terms of sequence B is 25.6.** \n"
