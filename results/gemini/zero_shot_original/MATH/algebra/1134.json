        "Here's how to factor the expression step-by-step:\n**1. Find the Greatest Common Factor (GCF):**\n* The GCF of 9, 27, and 27 is 9.\n* The GCF of  z\u00b3, z\u00b2, and z is z.\n* Therefore, the GCF of the entire expression is 9z.\n**2. Factor out the GCF:**\n*  Divide each term in the expression by 9z:\n    * (9z\u00b3 / 9z) = z\u00b2\n    * (27z\u00b2 / 9z) = 3z\n    * (27z / 9z) = 3\n**3. Write the factored expression:**\n*  The factored expression is: **9z(z\u00b2 - 3z + 3)** \n",
