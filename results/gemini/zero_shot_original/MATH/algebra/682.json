    "solution": "First, we note that $r$ must be positive, since otherwise $\\lfloor r \\rfloor + r$ is nonpositive. Next, we know that the decimal part of $r$ must be $0.5$. We write $r$ as $n+0.5$, where $n$ is the greatest integer less than $r.$ Therefore, we can write $\\lfloor r \\rfloor + r$ as $n+n+0.5=15.5$. Solving, we get $n=7.5$. This is impossible because $n$ must be an integer. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{0}$ values of $r$ such that $\\lfloor r \\rfloor + r = 15.5$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Floor Function:**\nThe floor function, denoted by $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$, gives the greatest integer less than or equal to  *x*. For example:\n*  $\\lfloor 3.2 \\rfloor = 3$\n*  $\\lfloor -1.7 \\rfloor = -2$\n**2. Analyze the Equation:**\nWe have the equation: $\\lfloor r \\rfloor + r = 15.5$\nLet's break it down:\n*  **$\\lfloor r \\rfloor$ is an integer.**  This means the left-hand side of the equation can only be a value that's half a unit above an integer. \n*  **r must be between two consecutive integers.** To get a result of 15.5, *r* must be between 15 and 16, since 15 + 0.5 = 15.5.\n**3. Find the Solution:**\nSince we need $\\lfloor r \\rfloor + r = 15.5$, the only solution is:\n*  $r = 15.5$  \nThis is because $\\lfloor 15.5 \\rfloor = 15$, and 15 + 15.5 = 15.5.\n**4. The Answer:**\nTherefore, there is only **one** value of *r* that satisfies the equation. \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**Understanding the Problem**\n* **Floor Function:** The floor function, denoted by $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$, gives the greatest integer less than or equal to *x*. For example, $\\lfloor 3.7 \\rfloor = 3$ and $\\lfloor -2.3 \\rfloor = -3$. \n**Solving the Equation**\n1. **Isolate the Floor Function:**  Subtract *r* from both sides of the equation: \n   \n   ```\n   \u230ar\u230b = 15.5 - r \n   ```\n2. **Consider the Range of the Floor Function:** Since the floor function gives an integer, the right side of the equation (15.5 - *r*) must be an integer.  This means *r* must have a decimal part of 0.5.\n3. **Find Possible Values of *r*:** Let's represent *r* as *n + 0.5*, where *n* is an integer.  Substituting into our equation:\n   ```\n   \u230an + 0.5\u230b = 15.5 - (n + 0.5)\n   ```\n   Simplifying:\n   ```\n   n = 15 - n \n   ```\n   Solving for *n*:\n   ```\n   2n = 15\n   n = 7.5\n   ```\n   Since *n* must be an integer, there are **no** values of *r* that satisfy the equation. \n**Conclusion**\nThere are **zero** values of *r* that satisfy the equation  \u230a*r*\u230b + *r* = 15.5. \n",
