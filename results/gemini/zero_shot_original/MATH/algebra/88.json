        "Here's how to solve for 'e' step-by-step:\n**1. Translate the word problems into equations:**\n* \"2d is 8 less than 17e\" translates to:  2d = 17e - 8 \n* \"2e is 9 less than d\" translates to: 2e = d - 9\n**2. Solve for 'd' in the second equation:**\n* Add 9 to both sides: 2e + 9 = d\n**3. Substitute the expression for 'd' from step 2 into the first equation:**\n* 2(2e + 9) = 17e - 8\n**4. Simplify and solve for 'e':**\n* 4e + 18 = 17e - 8\n* 26 = 13e \n* e = 26 / 13\n* **e = 2** \n**Therefore, e = 2** \n",
        "Here's how to solve for 'e' step-by-step:\n**1. Translate the word problems into equations:**\n*  \"2d is 8 less than 17e\":  This translates to  2d = 17e - 8\n*  \"2e is 9 less than d\": This translates to 2e = d - 9\n**2. Solve for 'd' in terms of 'e' using the second equation:**\n* Add 9 to both sides of the second equation: 2e + 9 = d\n**3. Substitute the value of 'd' from step 2 into the first equation:**\n* Substitute (2e + 9) for 'd' in the first equation: 2(2e + 9) = 17e - 8\n**4. Simplify and solve for 'e':**\n* Distribute the 2: 4e + 18 = 17e - 8\n* Subtract 4e from both sides: 18 = 13e - 8\n* Add 8 to both sides: 26 = 13e\n* Divide both sides by 13: e = 2\n**Therefore, the solution is e = 2.** \n",
