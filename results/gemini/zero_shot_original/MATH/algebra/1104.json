    "solution": "Suppose the price of the cellphone is reduced to $450 - 5x$ dollars; then it will sell $500 + 10x$ units, so the revenue will be\n\\begin{align*}\n(450 - 5x)(500 + 10x) &= 5(90 - x) 10(50 + x) \\\\\n&= 50 (90 - x)(50 + x) \\\\\n&= 50 (-x^2  + 40x + 4500),\n\\end{align*}in dollars.\n\nCompleting the square on $-x^2 + 40x + 4500,$ we get\n\\begin{align*}\n50 (-x^2 + 40x + 4500) &= 50 (-(x - 20)^2 + 400 + 4500) \\\\\n&= 50 (-(x - 20)^2 + 4900) \\\\\n&= -50 (x - 20)^2 + 245000.\n\\end{align*}This is maximized when $x = 20,$ so the optimal price of the smartphone is $450 - 5(20) = \\boxed{350}$ dollars.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Define Variables**\n* Let  'x' represent the number of $5 price decreases.\n**2. Express Price and Quantity in terms of 'x'**\n* **Price:**  The initial price is $450. Each decrease of $5 is represented by -5x. So, the price after 'x' decreases is  450 - 5x.\n* **Quantity:** The initial quantity is 500. Each decrease adds 10 smartphones, represented by 10x. So, the quantity sold after 'x' decreases is 500 + 10x.\n**3. Write the Revenue Function**\n* **Revenue = Price * Quantity**\n* Revenue = (450 - 5x)(500 + 10x) \n**4.

Find the Maximum Revenue**\nThe revenue function is a quadratic equation, and its graph is a parabola. The maximum revenue occurs at the vertex of the parabola.  We can find the x-coordinate of the vertex using the formula:\n* x = -b / 2a   (where 'a' and 'b' are the coefficients of the quadratic equation)\nIn our equation:\n* a = -50\n* b = 2000\n* x = -2000 / (2 * -50) = 20\n**6. Determine the Price for Maximum Revenue**\n* We found that x = 20. This means there should be 20 price decreases of $5 each.\n* The price for maximum revenue is: 450 - (5 * 20) = $350\n**Answer:**  A price of $350 would result in maximum revenue. \n",
