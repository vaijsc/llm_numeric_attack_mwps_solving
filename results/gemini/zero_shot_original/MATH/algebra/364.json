    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Completing the square, we add $(14/2)^2=49$ to both sides of the equation to get $x^2+14x+49=82 \\Rightarrow (x+7)^2=82$. Taking the square root of both sides, we get $x+7=\\sqrt{82}$ (we take the positive square root because we want the positive solution), or $x=\\sqrt{82}-7$. Thus, $a=82$ and $b=7$, so $a+b=\\boxed{89}$.",

        "1. **Rewrite the equation:**  Subtract 33 from both sides to get a quadratic equation: \n   \n   $x^2 + 14x - 33 = 0$\n2. **Factor the quadratic:** Find two numbers that multiply to -33 and add up to 14. These numbers are 17 and -3:\n   $(x+17)(x-3) = 0$\n3. **Solve for x:**  Set each factor equal to zero and solve:\n   *  x + 17 = 0  =>  x = -17\n   *  x - 3 = 0  =>  x = 3\n4. **Identify the positive solution:** The positive solution is x = 3.\n5. **Express the solution in the desired form:**  We can rewrite 3 as $\\sqrt{9} - 0$.\n6. **Find a + b:**  We have a = 9 and b = 0.

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n1. **Rewrite the equation:** Start by moving the constant term to the left side of the equation: \n   \n   $x^2 + 14x - 33 = 0$\n2. **Factor the quadratic:**  We need to find two numbers that multiply to -33 and add up to 14. These numbers are 17 and -3:\n   $(x + 17)(x - 3) = 0$\n3. **Solve for x:**  For the product of two factors to be zero, at least one of them must be zero. So we have two possible solutions:\n   *  $x + 17 = 0  \\Rightarrow x = -17$\n   *  $x - 3 = 0  \\Rightarrow x = 3$\n4. **Identify the positive solution:** The positive solution is  $x = 3$.\n5. **Express the positive solution in the desired form:** Notice that 3 can be written as  $\\sqrt{9} - 0$.\n6. **Find a + b:**  Therefore, $a = 9$ and $b = 0$.
