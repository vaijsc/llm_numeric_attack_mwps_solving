    "problem": "Angie decided to use her class as a sample to predict the total number of students in her school wearing red on Valentine's Day. She counted 11 students wearing red in her class of 24 students. Using this ratio, how many of the 480 students in her school will she estimate are wearing red?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We can use the given information to set up a ratio and solve for the number of kids in the school that are wearing red.  Let $x$ equal the total number of students wearing red in the school.  From the given information, we have$$\\frac{11}{24}=\\frac{x}{480},$$so  $$x=\\frac{480\\cdot 11}{24},$$which means $$x=20\\cdot 11=\\boxed{220}.$$",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the ratio of students wearing red to the total number of students in Angie's class:**\n* 11 students wearing red / 24 total students = 11/24\n**2. Set up a proportion to represent the ratio in the whole school:**\n* 11/24 = x/480  (where 'x' represents the unknown number of students wearing red in the whole school)\n**3. Solve for 'x' (the number of students wearing red in the school):**\n* Cross-multiply: 11 * 480 = 24 * x\n* Simplify: 5280 = 24x\n* Divide both sides by 24: x = 220\n**Answer:** Angie would estimate that **220** students in her school will be wearing red on Valentine's Day. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the proportion of students wearing red in Angie's class:**\n* Divide the number of students wearing red (11) by the total number of students in her class (24): 11 / 24 = 0.4583 (approximately) \n**2.  Convert the proportion to a percentage:**\n* Multiply the proportion by 100%: 0.4583 * 100% = 45.83% \n**3. Apply the percentage to the total school population:**\n* Multiply the percentage of students wearing red (45.83%) by the total number of students in the school (480): 45.83% * 480 = 220 students (approximately)\n**Answer:** Angie would estimate that approximately 220 students in her school will be wearing red on Valentine's Day. \n",

Round the answer to the nearest whole number:**\n* Since you can't have a fraction of a student, round 220.16 to 220.\n**Answer:** Angie would estimate that **220** students in her school will be wearing red on Valentine's Day. \n",
