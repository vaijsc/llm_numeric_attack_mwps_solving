    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Call the greater of the two squares $x^2$. Because the squares are consecutive, we can express the smaller square as $(x-1)^2$. We are given that $x^2 - (x-1)^2 = 35$. Expanding yields $x^2 - x^2 + 2x - 1 = 35$, or $2x = 36$. Therefore, $x = 18$, so the larger square is $18^2 = \\boxed{324}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand Perfect Squares:**\n* Perfect squares are the results of squaring whole numbers. \n* Examples: 1 (1\u00b2), 4 (2\u00b2), 9 (3\u00b2), 16 (4\u00b2), etc.\n**2. Consecutive Perfect Squares:**\n* Consecutive perfect squares are perfect squares that follow each other directly.\n* Example: 9 (3\u00b2) and 16 (4\u00b2) are consecutive perfect squares.\n**3. Set Up the Equation:**\n* Let 'x' represent the smaller perfect square.\n* The next consecutive perfect square is (x + 1)\u00b2.\n* The difference between these squares is (x + 1)\u00b2 - x\u00b2 = 35\n**4. Solve the Equation:**\n* Expand the equation: x\u00b2 + 2x + 1 - x\u00b2 = 35\n* Simplify: 2x + 1 = 35\n* Subtract 1 from both sides: 2x = 34\n* Divide both sides by 2: x = 17\n**5. Find the Greater Square:**\n* The smaller square is x\u00b2 = 17\u00b2 = 289\n* The greater square is (x + 1)\u00b2 = (17 + 1)\u00b2 = 18\u00b2 = 324\n**Answer:** The greater of the two squares is **324**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n* We're dealing with consecutive perfect squares, meaning squares of consecutive integers.\n* The difference between these squares is 35.\n**2. Set up an Equation**\nLet:\n*  *x* represent the smaller integer\n*  *x + 1* represent the larger integer\nThe squares of these numbers are:\n*  *x\u00b2*\n*  *(x + 1)\u00b2*\nThe problem states the difference is 35, so we can write the equation:\n*(x + 1)\u00b2 - x\u00b2 = 35*\n**3. Solve the Equation**\n* Expand the left side of the equation:  *x\u00b2 + 2x + 1 - x\u00b2 = 35*\n* Simplify: *2x + 1 = 35*\n* Subtract 1 from both sides: *2x = 34*\n* Divide both sides by 2: *x = 17*\n**4. Find the Greater Square**\nSince *x = 17*, the larger integer is *x + 1 = 18*.  The greater square is 18\u00b2 = **324**. \n**Therefore, the greater of the two squares is 324.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Understand Consecutive Perfect Squares**\nConsecutive perfect squares are squares of consecutive integers.  For example:\n* 1 and 4 (1\u00b2 and 2\u00b2)\n* 9 and 16 (3\u00b2 and 4\u00b2)\n**2. Set up the Equation**\nLet's represent the smaller square as *x\u00b2* and the larger square as *(x + 1)\u00b2*.  The problem tells us the difference between them is 35:\n(x + 1)\u00b2 - x\u00b2 = 35\n**3.
