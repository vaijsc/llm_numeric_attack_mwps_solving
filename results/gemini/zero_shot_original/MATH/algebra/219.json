        "Here's how to find the least possible result:\n**1. Understanding the Expression**\nThe expression is  $A ( B - C )$. To make this result as small as possible, we want:\n* **A to be as small as possible:**  This means A should be 4.\n* **(B - C) to be as negative as possible:** This means we want a large number for C and a small number for B. \n**2. Finding the Least Value**\n*  Let's try  A = 4, B = 5, and C = 6:\n   4 (5 - 6) = 4 (-1) = -4\n**3. Checking Other Possibilities**\nSince we want the smallest value, let's check if any other arrangement could give a result smaller than -4. There are only a few other possibilities:\n* A = 4, B = 6, C = 5:  4 (6 - 5) = 4 (1) = 4 (This is greater than -4)\n**Conclusion**\nThe least possible result of the expression is **-4**. \n",
        "Here's how to find the least possible result step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nWe want to make the entire expression as small as possible. To do this, we need to:\n* **Maximize the subtraction:**  We want the difference (B - C) to be as large as possible.\n* **Minimize the multiplication:** We want the product of A and (B - C) to be as small as possible.\n**2.  Finding the Largest Difference:**\n* To make (B - C) as large as possible, we should assign the largest number (6) to 'B' and the smallest number (4) to 'C'. \n* This gives us (6 - 4) = 2.\n**3. Minimizing the Multiplication:**\n* Now we have 2 inside the parentheses.  To make the entire product as small as possible, we should assign the smallest remaining number (5) to 'A'.\n**4. Calculate the Result:**\n* The expression becomes: 5 * (6 - 4) = 5 * 2 = 10\n**Therefore, the least possible result of the expression is 10.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nWe want to find the smallest possible value of the expression  $A ( B - C )$, where A, B, and C are replaced with the numbers 4, 5, and 6.\n**2. Minimizing the Expression:**\n* **Maximize (B - C):** To minimize the entire expression, we need to make the difference (B - C) as small as possible.  \n* **Minimize A:**  Since we're multiplying by A, making A as small as possible will minimize the overall result.\n**3. Applying the Logic:**\n* **Smallest Difference:** The smallest difference we can get using 4, 5, and 6 is 1 (6 - 5). \n* **Smallest A:**  The smallest number we can use for A is 4.\n**4.  Calculation:**\nSubstituting the values, we get: 4 (6 - 5) = 4 * 1 = 4\n**Answer:** The least possible result is **4**. \n",
