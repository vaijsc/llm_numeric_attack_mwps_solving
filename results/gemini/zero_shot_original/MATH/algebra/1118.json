        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Rational Root Theorem**\nThe Rational Root Theorem tells us that any rational root of a polynomial with integer coefficients must be of the form p/q, where p is a factor of the constant term (-1) and q is a factor of the leading coefficient (8).  \n* Factors of -1: \u00b11\n* Factors of 8: \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b14, \u00b18\nTherefore, the possible rational roots are: \u00b11, \u00b11/2, \u00b11/4, \u00b11/8.  We can test these values by plugging them into the equation.  We find that x = 1 is a root.\n**2. Polynomial Division**\nSince x = 1 is a root, we know (x - 1) is a factor of the polynomial. We can use polynomial division to find the other factor:\n```\n        8x^2 + 5x + 2\n    x - 1 | 8x^3 - 3x^2 - 3x - 1 \n           -(8x^3 - 8x^2)\n              5x^2 - 3x\n              -(5x^2 - 5x)\n                   2x - 1\n                   -(2x - 2)\n                       1 \n```\nThis gives us: (x - 1)(8x^2 + 5x + 2) = 0\n**3. Quadratic Formula**\nThe quadratic factor, 8x^2 + 5x + 2, doesn't factor easily. We'll use the quadratic formula to find its roots:\nx = [-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a\nWhere a = 8, b = 5, and c = 2.\nx = [-5 \u00b1 \u221a(5^2 - 4 * 8 * 2)] / (2 * 8)\nx = [-5 \u00b1 \u221a(-39)] / 16\nx = [-5 \u00b1 i\u221a39] / 16\nSince the problem asks for the real root, we only care about the root x = 1 we found earlier.\n**4. Expressing the Root in the Desired Form**\nWe need to express the root x = 1 in the form (\u221ba + \u221bb + 1)/c.  Notice that:\n1 = (\u221b1 + \u221b1 + 1) / 1\n**5.

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Rational Root Theorem**\nThe Rational Root Theorem tells us that if a polynomial equation has integer coefficients, then any rational root must be of the form  $\\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ is a factor of the constant term and $q$ is a factor of the leading coefficient.\n* In our equation, the constant term is -1, and the leading coefficient is 8.\n* The factors of -1 are \u00b11, and the factors of 8 are \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b14, \u00b18.\nThis means any rational root must be one of the following: \u00b11, \u00b11/2, \u00b11/4, \u00b11/8.\n**2. Testing for Roots**\nWe can test each of these potential roots by plugging them into the equation.  We find that $x = 1$ is a root:\n* $8(1)^3 - 3(1)^2 - 3(1) - 1 = 8 - 3 - 3 - 1 = 1$\n**3. Polynomial Division**\nSince we found a root, we can use polynomial division to factor the polynomial:\n```\n        8x^2 + 5x + 2\n     ___________________\n8x - 1 | 8x^3 - 3x^2 - 3x - 1\n         -(8x^3 - x^2)\n         --------------\n               -2x^2 - 3x\n               -(-2x^2 + 1/2x)\n               ----------------\n                      -7/2x - 1\n                      -(-7/2x + 1/4)\n                      -------------\n                             -5/4\n```\nThis gives us:  \n  (8x - 1)(8x^2 + 5x + 2) = 0\n**4.

Simplifying the Radical**\nThe square root of -39 can be written as $\\sqrt{39}i$, where 'i' is the imaginary unit. Since the problem asks for a real root, we know our solution will involve the root we found earlier (x = 1).\n**6. Finding the Expression**\nThe real root of the equation is x = 1.  Let's try to express this in the form  $\\frac{\\sqrt[3]a + \\sqrt[3]b + 1}{c}$:\n* We can write 1 as $\\frac{1 + 0 + 1}{1}$. \nTherefore, we have:\n*  $a = 1$\n*  $b = 0$\n*  $c = 1$\nFinally, $a + b + c = 1 + 0 + 1 = \\boxed{2}$. \n",

Simplifying the Solution**\nSince the discriminant is negative, the quadratic has complex roots.  We are only interested in the real root, which is $x = 1$. \n* However, the problem asks us to express the real root in the form $\\frac{\\sqrt[3]a + \\sqrt[3]b + 1}{c}$.

Polynomial Division**\nSince $x=1$ is a root, we know that $(x-1)$ is a factor of the polynomial. We can use polynomial division to divide $8x^3 - 3x^2 - 3x - 1$ by $(x-1)$:\n```\n          8x^2 + 5x + 2 \n     x - 1 | 8x^3 - 3x^2 - 3x - 1 \n             8x^3 - 8x^2\n             ----------------\n                    5x^2 - 3x\n                    5x^2 - 5x\n                    ------------\n                           2x - 1\n                           2x - 2\n                           ------\n                                  1 \n```\nThis tells us that \n $$8x^3 - 3x^2 - 3x - 1 = (x-1)(8x^2 + 5x + 2)$$\n**3. Solving the Quadratic**\nNow we need to solve the quadratic equation $8x^2 + 5x + 2 = 0$.

Simplifying the Expression**\nWe know one root is $x = 1$.  The other real root is:\n$$x = \\frac{-5 - \\sqrt{-47}}{16} = \\frac{-5 - i\\sqrt{47}}{16}$$\nTo express this in the form $\\frac{\\sqrt[3]a + \\sqrt[3]b + 1}{c}$, we need to manipulate the expression.
