        "Here's how to evaluate  $\\log_2 8\\sqrt{2}$ step by step:\n**1. Simplify the argument:**\n*  We can rewrite  $8\\sqrt{2}$ as $2^3 \\cdot 2^{1/2}$  using the fact that $8=2^3$ and $\\sqrt{2} = 2^{1/2}$.\n*  Using the rule of exponents  $a^m \\cdot a^n = a^{m+n}$, we combine these terms:  $2^3 \\cdot 2^{1/2} = 2^{3 + 1/2} = 2^{7/2}$.\n**2. Use the definition of logarithms:**\n*  Remember that $\\log_a b = c$ is equivalent to  $a^c = b$.\n*  We want to find the exponent (c) that we need to raise 2 to in order to get  $2^{7/2}$. \n**3. Solution:**\n*  Since we already have $2^{7/2}$, we know that $c = 7/2$.  \n**Therefore,  $\\log_2 8\\sqrt{2} = \\boxed{\\frac{7}{2}}$** \n",
