        "Here's how to find the domain of the function step-by-step:\n**1. Innermost Square Root:**\n* The expression under the innermost square root, \u221ax, must be non-negative.  This means  x \u2265 0.\n**2. Second Square Root:**\n* The expression under the second square root, 2 - \u221ax, must also be non-negative.  We already know x \u2265 0, so \u221ax \u2265 0. Therefore:\n    * 2 - \u221ax \u2265 0\n    * 2 \u2265 \u221ax\n    * 4 \u2265 x \n**3.
