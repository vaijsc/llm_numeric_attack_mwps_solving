    "solution": "From $x^2-mx+n=0$, we get $k+t=m$ and $kt=n$. Since $n$ is prime, one of $k$ and $t$ is $n$ and the other is 1. $k>t$, so $k=n$ and $t=1$. Then $m=n+1$. $m$ is also prime, so we have two consecutive integers that are prime. Since one of every two consecutive integers is even, and the only even prime is 2, we must have $n=2$ and $m=3$. Therefore, $m^n+n^m+k^t+t^k= 3^2+2^3+2^1+1^2=9+8+2+1=\\boxed{20}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Relate the roots to the coefficients**\nSince $k$ and $t$ are the roots of the quadratic equation, we know the following relationships:\n* **Sum of roots:**  $k + t = m$\n* **Product of roots:** $k \\cdot t = n$\n**2.  Use the prime number information**\n* Since $m$ and $n$ are prime numbers, they have exactly two divisors: 1 and themselves. This means that either:\n    *  $k = m$ and $t = 1$ \n    *  $k = n$ and $t = 1$\n**3. Determine the value of m and n**\nLet's consider both cases:\n* **Case 1:** If $k = m$ and $t = 1$, then from the sum of roots equation, we have:\n    *  $m + 1 = m$. This is not possible, so Case 1 is eliminated.\n* **Case 2:** If $k = n$ and $t = 1$, then from the product of roots equation, we have:\n    *  $n \\cdot 1 = n$. This is true, so Case 2 is possible.\nTherefore, $k = n$ and $t = 1$. \n**4. Calculate the final expression**\nNow, let's substitute these values into the expression we need to evaluate:\n*  $m^n + n^m + k^t + t^k = m^n + n^m + n^1 + 1^n$ \n*  Since $n = k$, we can simplify further: $m^n + n^m + n + 1$\n**5. We can't determine a unique numerical value**\nWe know that $m$ and $n$ are prime, but we don't have enough information to determine their specific values.  Therefore, we can't find a single numerical answer for the expression $m^n + n^m + n + 1$. \n**Conclusion:**  The expression $m^n + n^m + k^t + t^k$ can be simplified to $m^n + n^m + n + 1$, but we can't find a unique numerical value without more information about the specific prime numbers $m$ and $n$. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Using Vieta's Formulas**\n* **Sum of roots:**  For a quadratic equation of the form  $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, Vieta's formulas tell us that the sum of the roots is  -b/a. In this case, the sum of the roots (k and t) is:  \n   *  k + t = m\n* **Product of roots:** Vieta's formulas also tell us that the product of the roots is c/a. In this case, the product of the roots is:\n   *  k * t = n\n**2.  Using the Prime Number Information**\nSince m and n are prime numbers, we know:\n* **m and n are both greater than 1.**\n* **m and n have only two divisors: 1 and themselves.**\n**3.  Analyzing the Possibilities**\nLet's consider the possible values of k and t, keeping in mind that k > t:\n* **If k = m and t = 1:** This satisfies both Vieta's formulas (k + t = m and k * t = n).\n* **If k = n and t = 1:** This also satisfies both Vieta's formulas.\n**4.  Calculating the Expression**\nSince we have two possible solutions for k and t, let's calculate the expression  m^n + n^m + k^t + t^k for each case:\n* **Case 1 (k = m, t = 1):** \n   * m^n + n^m + k^t + t^k = m^n + n^m + m^1 + 1^m = m^n + n^m + m + 1\n* **Case 2 (k = n, t = 1):**\n   * m^n + n^m + k^t + t^k = m^n + n^m + n^1 + 1^n = m^n + n^m + n + 1\n**5.  Conclusion**\nWe can't determine a single numerical answer for m^n + n^m + k^t + t^k because there are two possible solutions for k and t. The expression can be either **m^n + n^m + m + 1** or **m^n + n^m + n + 1**, depending on the specific values of m and n. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Relate the roots to the coefficients**\nFor a quadratic equation of the form  ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0, the following relationships hold:\n* **Sum of roots:** -b/a\n* **Product of roots:** c/a\nIn our case, the equation is x\u00b2 - mx + n = 0. Applying the relationships:\n* **k + t = m**  (Since a = 1, b = -m)\n* **k * t = n**  (Since c = n)\n**2.  Analyze the prime factors**\n* **m is prime:** This means m has only two factors: 1 and itself. Since k and t are positive integers, and k + t = m, either k = 1 and t = m-1, or vice versa.\n* **n is prime:**  Since k * t = n, one of k or t must be 1, and the other must be n.\n**3.  Determine the values of k and t**\nCombining the information from step 2, we see that:\n* **k = n** (the larger root)\n* **t = 1** (the smaller root)\n**4.  Calculate the expression**\nNow we can substitute the values of k, t, m, and n into the expression:\nm\u207f + n\u1d50 + k\u1d57 + t\u1d4f = m\u207f + n\u1d50 + n\u00b9 + 1\u1d4f\nSince t = 1, 1\u1d4f = 1.  Also, we know that m = k + t = n + 1.  Substituting these values, we get:\n(n + 1)\u207f + n\u207d\u207f\u207a\u00b9\u207e + n + 1\n**Therefore, the value of m\u207f + n\u1d50 + k\u1d57 + t\u1d4f is (n + 1)\u207f + n\u207d\u207f\u207a\u00b9\u207e + n + 1.**  We cannot simplify this expression further without knowing the specific prime value of 'n'. \n",

Relate the roots to the coefficients:**\n* **Sum of roots:**  In a quadratic equation of the form  *ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0*, the sum of the roots is -b/a.  Therefore, for our equation,  *k + t = m*.\n* **Product of roots:** The product of the roots is c/a.  Therefore, *k*t = *n*.\n**2. Use the prime nature of *m* and *n*:**\n* Since *m* is prime, the only way to get *m* as the sum of two positive integers is if one of them is 1.  This means either *k = m - 1* or *t = m - 1*. \n* Since *k > t*, we know that *k = m - 1*.\n* Since *n* is prime and *n = k*t, either *k = 1* or *t = 1*.  But *k = m - 1*, so *t = 1*.\n**3.

Calculate the expression:**\nWe need to find *m^n + n^m + k^t + t^k*.  Substitute the values we found:\n* *m^n + n^m + k^t + t^k = m^(m-1) + (m-1)^m + (m-1)^1 + 1^ (m-1)*\nSince anything to the power of 1 is itself, and 1 to any power is 1, this simplifies to:\n* *m^(m-1) + (m-1)^m + (m-1) + 1*\n**We cannot simplify this further without knowing the specific values of *m* (and hence *n*).**  Therefore, the answer is: **m^(m-1) + (m-1)^m + (m-1) + 1**. \n",
