    "problem": "Diana can either invest $20,\\!000$ dollars for $4$ years with a simple interest rate of $6\\%$ or an interest rate of $7\\%$ which compounds quarterly. How many more dollars, rounded to the nearest dollar, would she get with the better interest rate than with the worse one?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "She would get $20000 \\cdot 0.06=1200$ dollars per year from the simple interest. This gives her $20000+4\\cdot1200=24800$ dollars in the end.\n\nFor the compounded interest, we use the formula $A=P\\left(1+\\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt}$, where $A$ is the end balance, $P$ is the principal, $r$ is the interest rate, $t$ is the number of years, and $n$ is the number of times compounded in a year. This equation represents the idea that the interest is compounded every $1/n$ years with a rate of $r/n$ each time. Substituting the information given, we get $$A=20000\\left(1+\\frac{0.07}{4}\\right)^{4 \\cdot 4}=20000\\left(1+\\frac{0.07}{4}\\right)^{16} \\approx 26399.$$Therefore, she should choose the compounded interest and earn $26399-24800=\\boxed{1599 \\text{ dollars}}$ more.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Calculate Simple Interest:**\n* **Interest per year:** $20,000 * 0.06 = $1200\n* **Total interest over 4 years:** $1200 * 4 = $4800\n* **Total amount after 4 years with simple interest:** $20,000 + $4800 = $24,800\n**2. Calculate Compound Interest:**\n* **Interest rate per quarter:** 7% / 4 = 1.75%\n* **Number of quarters:** 4 years * 4 quarters/year = 16 quarters\n* **Amount after each quarter:** $20,000 * (1 + 0.0175) = $20,350\n* **Amount after 16 quarters:** $20,000 * (1 + 0.0175)^16  \u2248 $25,148 \n**3.
