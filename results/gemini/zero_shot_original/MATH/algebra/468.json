    "solution": "The absolute value of the product of two numbers is the product of their absolute values, so we can write  \\[\n|x^2-16|=|(x+4)(x-4)|=|x+4|\\,|x-4|.\n\\]Since $|x^2-16|$ is written as the product of two positive integers, it is composite unless one of the integers is $1$.  Solving $|x+4|=1$, we observe that either $x+4=1$ or $x+4=-1$, which give solutions of $x=-3$ and $x=-5$.  Similarly, solving $|x-4|=1$ we find $x=3$ or $x=5$. Among the possible solutions $\\{-5,-3,3,5\\}$, only $\\{-3,3\\}$ yield a prime value for $|x+4|\\,|x-4|$.  Therefore, the product of the integer values of $x$ for which $|x^2-16|$ is a prime number is $\\boxed{-9}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand Absolute Value**\nThe absolute value of a number is its distance from zero, always a non-negative value.  So,  |x| represents the positive value of x, regardless of whether x is positive or negative.\n**2. Analyze the Expression**\nWe have the expression |x\u00b2 - 16|.  Let's break it down further:\n* **Factoring:**  x\u00b2 - 16 is a difference of squares, which factors as (x + 4)(x - 4).\n* **Absolute Value:**  Since we're taking the absolute value, we need to consider both cases:\n    * **Case 1: x\u00b2 - 16 \u2265 0**  This means |x\u00b2 - 16| = x\u00b2 - 16\n    * **Case 2: x\u00b2 - 16 < 0**  This means |x\u00b2 - 16| = -(x\u00b2 - 16) \n**3. Prime Numbers**\nA prime number is a whole number greater than 1 that has only two divisors: 1 and itself.  \n**4. Solving for x**\n**Case 1: x\u00b2 - 16 \u2265 0**\n* We need to find values of x for which x\u00b2 - 16 is a prime number. \n* Since x\u00b2 - 16 = (x + 4)(x - 4), the only way this can be prime is if one of the factors is 1 and the other is a prime number.\n* This leads to the solutions:\n    * x = 3 (giving (3 + 4)(3 - 4) = -7)\n    * x = -3 (giving (-3 + 4)(-3 - 4) = -7)\n**Case 2: x\u00b2 - 16 < 0**\n* Here, |x\u00b2 - 16| = -(x\u00b2 - 16) = 16 - x\u00b2.  \n*  We again need 16 - x\u00b2 to be a prime number.  However, 16 - x\u00b2 will always be less than 16. The only prime number less than 16 is 2.  \n* There are no integer solutions for x that make 16 - x\u00b2 equal to 2.\n**5. Finding the Product**\nThe two integer values of x that make |x\u00b2 - 16| a prime number are x = 3 and x = -3.  Their product is:\n3 * -3 = **-9** \n",
