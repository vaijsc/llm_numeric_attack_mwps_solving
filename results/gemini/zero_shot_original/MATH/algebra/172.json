    "solution": "First we bring $3x$ to the left side to get  \\[x^2-7x-14=16.\\]Moving the 14 to the right side gives \\[x^2-7x=30.\\]We notice that the left side is almost the square $\\left(x-\\frac72\\right)^2=x^2-7x+\\frac{49}4$. Adding $\\frac{49}4$ to both sides lets us complete the square on the left-hand side, \\[x^2-7x+\\frac{49}4=30+\\frac{49}4=\\frac{169}4,\\]so  \\[\\left(x-\\frac72\\right)^2=\\left(\\frac{13}2\\right)^2.\\]Therefore $x=\\frac72\\pm\\frac{13}2$.  The positive difference between these solutions is  \\[\\frac{7+13}2-\\frac{7-13}2=\\frac{26}2=\\boxed{13}.\\]",

        "1. **Simplify the equation:** Combine like terms to get a standard quadratic equation: \n   \n   ```\n   x^2 - 4x - 14 = 3x + 16\n   x^2 - 7x - 30 = 0\n   ```\n2. **Factor the quadratic:** Find two numbers that multiply to -30 and add up to -7.  These numbers are -10 and 3.  Therefore, we can factor the quadratic as:\n   ```\n   (x - 10)(x + 3) = 0\n   ```\n3. **Solve for x:** Set each factor equal to zero and solve:\n   ```\n   x - 10 = 0  =>  x = 10\n   x + 3 = 0  =>  x = -3\n   ```\n4. **Find the difference:** The two solutions are 10 and -3.  Their difference is 10 - (-3) = 13.\n5. **Positive difference:** Since we want the positive difference, the answer is **13**. \n",
        "1. **Simplify the equation:** Subtract $3x+16$ from both sides to get a standard quadratic equation:\n   \n   $x^2 - 7x - 30 = 0$\n2. **Factor the quadratic:**  Find two numbers that multiply to -30 and add up to -7. These numbers are -10 and 3.  So we can factor the equation as:\n   $(x - 10)(x + 3) = 0$\n3. **Solve for x:**  For the product of two factors to equal zero, one or both of the factors must be zero.  Therefore:\n   *  $x - 10 = 0$  -->  $x = 10$\n   *  $x + 3 = 0$   -->  $x = -3$\n4. **Calculate the difference:**  The difference between the two solutions is $10 - (-3) = 13$.\n5. **The positive difference:** Since we want the positive difference, the answer is **13**. \n",
