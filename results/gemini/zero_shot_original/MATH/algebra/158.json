    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since the perimeter is 12, the sides of the rectangle add up to $12/2 = 6.$  Let $x$ be one side length of the rectangle.  Then the other side length is $6 - x,$ so the area is\n\\[x(6 - x) = 6x - x^2.\\]Completing the square, we get\n\\[-x^2 + 6x = -x^2 + 6x - 9 + 9 = 9 - (x - 3)^2.\\]Thus, the maximum area of the rectangle is $\\boxed{9}$ square inches, which occurs for a $3 \\times 3$ square.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Formulas**\n* **Perimeter of a rectangle:** P = 2l + 2w (where l = length, w = width)\n* **Area of a rectangle:** A = l * w\n**2. Set Up the Problem**\n* We know the perimeter is 12 inches:  12 = 2l + 2w\n* We want to maximize the area: A = l * w\n**3. Express Area in Terms of One Variable**\n* Solve the perimeter equation for one variable (let's solve for l):\n   12 = 2l + 2w\n   6 = l + w\n   l = 6 - w\n* Substitute this expression for 'l' into the area equation:\n   A = (6 - w) * w\n   A = 6w - w^2\n**4. Find the Maximum Area**\n* The area equation is a quadratic function, which means its graph is a parabola. The maximum value of the parabola represents the maximum area. \n* The x-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola gives us the width (w) that maximizes the area. We can find the vertex's x-coordinate using: w = -b / 2a (where a and b are the coefficients in the quadratic equation)\n* In our area equation (A = 6w - w^2), a = -1 and b = 6.\n* Therefore, w = -6 / (2 * -1) = 3 inches.\n**5. Calculate the Length and Maximum Area**\n* Substitute the value of w (3 inches) back into the equation l = 6 - w to find the length:\n   l = 6 - 3 = 3 inches\n* Calculate the maximum area:\n   A = l * w = 3 * 3 = 9 square inches\n**Answer:** The maximum area of a rectangle with a perimeter of 12 inches is **9 square inches**. \n",

Set Up the Problem**\nWe know the perimeter is 12 inches:  12 = 2l + 2w\n**3. Solve for One Variable**\nLet's solve for length (l):\n* 6 = l + w\n* l = 6 - w\n**4. Substitute into the Area Formula**\nSubstitute the expression for 'l' into the area formula:\n* A = (6 - w) * w\n* A = 6w - w\u00b2\n**5. Find the Maximum Area**\nThe area formula is now a quadratic equation. The graph of this equation is a parabola opening downwards, meaning it has a maximum point. To find this maximum, we can use the following:\n* **Vertex Formula:**  The x-coordinate of the vertex of a parabola in the form y = ax\u00b2 + bx + c is given by  x = -b / 2a\nIn our area formula (A = 6w - w\u00b2), a = -1 and b = 6. So:\n* w = -6 / (2 * -1) = 3\n**6. Calculate the Length**\nSubstitute w = 3 back into the equation l = 6 - w:\n* l = 6 - 3 = 3\n**7. Calculate the Maximum Area**\nNow that we know l = 3 and w = 3, we can find the maximum area:\n* A = l * w = 3 * 3 = 9\n**Answer:** The maximum number of square inches in the area of a rectangle with a perimeter of 12 inches is **9 square inches**. \n**Important Note:**  The rectangle with the maximum area for a given perimeter is always a square. \n",

Using Completing the Square**\n* **Rewrite the area equation:** A = -w\u00b2 + 6w \n* **Factor out a -1:** A = -(w\u00b2 - 6w)\n* **Complete the square inside the parentheses:** Take half of the coefficient of 'w' (-6), square it (9), and add and subtract it inside the parentheses: \n    A = -(w\u00b2 - 6w + 9 - 9) \n* **Factor the perfect square trinomial:**  A = -(w - 3)\u00b2 + 9\n* **The maximum area:** The vertex of the parabola is at (3, 9). This means the maximum area is **9 square inches**.\n**7. Conclusion**\nThe maximum number of square inches in the area of a rectangle with a perimeter of 12 inches is **9**. This occurs when the rectangle is a square with sides of 3 inches each. \n",
