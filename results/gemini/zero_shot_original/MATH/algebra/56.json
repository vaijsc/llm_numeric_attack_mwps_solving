    "solution": "The fraction $\\frac{1}{2y+1}$ fails to be defined only if the denominator is zero. This occurs when $y$ is the solution of the equation $$2y+1=0,$$ which is $y=-\\frac 12$. Thus the domain of $k(y)$ is $$\\boxed{\\left(-\\infty,-\\frac 12\\right)\\cup \\left(-\\frac 12,\\infty\\right)}.$$",

Express the Domain:**\nThis means that *y* cannot be equal to -1/2.  We can express this in interval notation as:\n**(-\u221e, -1/2) U (-1/2, \u221e)** \nThis means the domain includes all real numbers except for -1/2. \n",
        "The domain of a function is the set of all possible input values (in this case, values of *y*) that result in a defined output.  We need to find any values of *y* that would cause problems in our function.\nThe only potential issue is in the denominator.  A fraction is undefined when its denominator is zero. So, we need to find the value of *y* that makes the denominator zero:\n2*y* + 1 = 0\nSolving for *y*:\n2*y* = -1\n*y* = -1/2\nThis means the function is undefined when *y* = -1/2.  For all other values of *y*, the function is defined.\nTherefore, the domain of the function *k(y)* is all real numbers except -1/2.
