        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Complete the Square**\nTo find the radius, we need to rewrite the equation in standard circle form: $(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$ where $(h,k)$ is the center and $r$ is the radius.\n* **Complete the square for x:**  Take half of the coefficient of our x term (8), square it (16), and add it to both sides of the equation: \n   \n   x\u00b2 + 8x + 16 + y\u00b2 + 4y + c = 16 \n* **Complete the square for y:**  Take half of the coefficient of our y term (4), square it (4), and add it to both sides of the equation:\n   x\u00b2 + 8x + 16 + y\u00b2 + 4y + 4 + c = 16 + 4 \n**2.

In standard form, the right side of the equation is r\u00b2. So:\n  (x + 4)\u00b2 + (y + 2)\u00b2 + c = 3\u00b2 \n  (x + 4)\u00b2 + (y + 2)\u00b2 + c = 9\n**4.  Solve for c**\nTo make the right side equal to 9, we need: \n  c = 9 - 20\n  c = **-11** \n**Therefore, the value of c that makes the circle have a radius of length 3 is -11.** \n",

Complete the Square**\nTo find the radius, we need to rewrite the equation in standard circle form:  $(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$, where (h,k) is the center and r is the radius.  To do this, we complete the square for both the x and y terms:\n* **x terms:**  Take half of the coefficient of x (which is 8), square it (16), and add it to both sides of the equation. \n* **y terms:** Take half of the coefficient of y (which is 4), square it (4), and add it to both sides of the equation.\nThis gives us:\n```\nx^2 + 8x + 16 + y^2 + 4y + 4 + c = 16 + 4\n```\n**2. Rewrite in Standard Form**\nNow, factor the perfect square trinomials:\n```\n(x + 4)^2 + (y + 2)^2 + c = 20\n```\n**3. Solve for c**\nWe know the radius is 3, so r\u00b2 = 9.  Set the right side of the equation equal to 9 and solve for c:\n```\n(x + 4)^2 + (y + 2)^2 + c = 9\nc = 9 - 20\nc = -11\n```\n**Therefore, the value of c that makes the circle have a radius of length 3 is -11.** \n",
