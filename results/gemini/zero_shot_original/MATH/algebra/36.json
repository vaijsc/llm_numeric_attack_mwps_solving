We can then plug this value into the inequality and add 4 to $-4$, $x^4+4x^2$, and 21, yielding $$0<y^{2}+4y+4<25.$$We can factor $y^2+4y+4$ to obtain $$0<(y+2)^{2}<25.$$Taking the square root gives us $0<|y+2|<5$, which in turn gives us two intervals for solutions of $y$: $-2<y<3$, or $-7<y<-2$.\n\nHowever, $y$ must be non-negative since $y=x^{2}$, so we have $0\\leq y<3$.

        "Here's how to solve the inequality step-by-step:\n**1. Simplify the Inequality**\nNotice that the expression $x^4 + 4x^2$ can be factored: \n \n  *  $x^4 + 4x^2 = x^2 (x^2 + 4)$\nNow our inequality looks like this:\n  *  $-4 < x^2(x^2 + 4) < 21$\n**2. Analyze the Expression**\n* **x\u00b2 term:**  The term $x^2$ is always non-negative (greater than or equal to zero) for all real values of *x*. \n* **x\u00b2 + 4 term:** The term $x^2 + 4$ is always positive (greater than zero) for all real values of *x*.\n**3. Solve the Inequalities**\nSince both $x^2$ and $x^2 + 4$ are always non-negative, we can divide the inequality by them without changing the direction of the inequality signs. Let's break it into two separate inequalities:\n* **-4 < x\u00b2(x\u00b2 + 4):**  This inequality is always true because the left side is negative and the right side is always non-negative. \n* **x\u00b2(x\u00b2 + 4) < 21:**  We can divide both sides by (x\u00b2 + 4) since it's always positive: \n    *  x\u00b2 < 21/(x\u00b2 + 4)\n    *  Since (x\u00b2 + 4) is always greater than 4, we know  21/(x\u00b2 + 4) is always less than 21/4. \n    *  Therefore, we only need to consider the inequality: x\u00b2 < 21/4 \n**4. Solve for x**\n*  \u221ax\u00b2 < \u221a(21/4)\n*  |x| < \u221a(21/4)\n*  |x| < (\u221a21)/2\nThis means that x lies between -(\u221a21)/2 and (\u221a21)/2.\n**5. Express the Solution in Interval Notation**\nThe solution in interval notation is **(-(\u221a21)/2, (\u221a21)/2)**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the inequality step-by-step:\n**1. Simplify the inequality:**\n* Notice that the expression inside the inequality,  $x^4 + 4x^2$, resembles a quadratic.  We can make this clearer by making a substitution:  let  $y = x^2$. \n* Now we have the inequality: $-4 < y^2 + 4y < 21$\n**2. Solve the two separate inequalities:**\n* **First inequality:** $-4 < y^2 + 4y$\n   * Subtract $-4$ from both sides:  $0 < y^2 + 4y + 4$\n   * Factor the right side: $0 < (y + 2)^2$\n   * This inequality is always true since the square of any real number is non-negative.\n* **Second inequality:** $y^2 + 4y < 21$\n   * Subtract 21 from both sides:  $y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0$\n   * Factor the left side: $(y + 7)(y - 3) < 0$\n   * Find the critical points where the expression equals zero:  $y = -7$ and $y = 3$.\n   * Test the intervals: \n      * For $y < -7$:  Both factors are negative, so the product is positive.\n      * For $-7 < y < 3$:  One factor is positive, the other is negative, so the product is negative.\n      * For $y > 3$:  Both factors are positive, so the product is positive.\n   * The solution to this inequality is $-7 < y < 3$.\n**3. Combine the solutions and substitute back:**\n* We found that the solution to the first inequality is always true, and the solution to the second inequality is $-7 < y < 3$.  Therefore, the solution to the combined inequality is $-7 < y < 3$.\n* Substitute back $y = x^2$:  $-7 < x^2 < 3$.\n**4. Solve for x:**\n* **For the left inequality:** $-7 < x^2$  This is always true since the square of any real number is non-negative.\n* **For the right inequality:** $x^2 < 3$ \n   * Take the square root of both sides (remembering both positive and negative roots): $-\\sqrt{3} < x < \\sqrt{3}$.\n**5. Express the solution in interval notation:**\nThe solution is the intersection of the solutions to the two inequalities:  **(-\u221a3, \u221a3)**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the inequality step-by-step:\n**1. Factor the middle expression:**\nThe middle expression,  *x*\u2074 + 4*x*\u00b2,  is a perfect square trinomial.  We can factor it as ( *x*\u00b2 + 2)\u00b2:\n-4 < ( *x*\u00b2 + 2)\u00b2 < 21\n**2. Break the inequality into two separate inequalities:**\nSince we have a compound inequality, we need to separate it into two parts:\n* **Part 1:** -4 < ( *x*\u00b2 + 2)\u00b2\n* **Part 2:** ( *x*\u00b2 + 2)\u00b2 < 21\n**3.

Express the solution in interval notation:**\nThe solution to the inequality is:  *x* \u2208 (-\u221a(\u221a21 - 2), \u221a(\u221a21 - 2))\n**Therefore, the solution in interval notation is (-\u221a(\u221a21 - 2), \u221a(\u221a21 - 2)).** \n",
