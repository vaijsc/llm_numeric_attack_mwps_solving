    "solution": "Every real number can be expressed in the form $1-x$ for some real $x$, and every real number except $0$ can be expressed as the reciprocal of some real number. Therefore, the range of $f(x)=\\frac{1}{1-x}$ consists of all real numbers except $0$. In interval notation, this is $\\boxed{(-\\infty,0)\\cup (0,\\infty)}$.",

        "### Response:\n1. **Identify the restrictions:** The function $f(x) = \\frac{1}{1-x}$ is undefined when the denominator is zero. This happens when $1-x = 0$, which means $x = 1$.\n2. **Consider the behavior near the restriction:** As $x$ approaches 1 from the left (values slightly less than 1), the denominator becomes very small and positive, making the fraction very large and positive.  As $x$ approaches 1 from the right (values slightly greater than 1), the denominator becomes very small and negative, making the fraction very large and negative.\n3. **Determine the range:**  The function can take on any value except for 0.  This is because no matter how large or small the numerator is, it can never be zero.\n4. **Express in interval notation:** The range of the function is all real numbers except for 0.  In interval notation, this is written as:  **$(-\\infty, 0) \\cup (0, \\infty)$** \n",
        "### Response:\n**1. Identify the restrictions:**\nThe function is undefined when the denominator is zero. So, we need to find the value of *x* that makes the denominator zero:\n1 - *x* = 0\n*x* = 1\nThis means the function is undefined at *x* = 1.\n**2. Consider the behavior near the restriction:**\nAs *x* approaches 1 from the left (values slightly less than 1), the denominator becomes a very small negative number. This makes the function value a large negative number.\nAs *x* approaches 1 from the right (values slightly greater than 1), the denominator becomes a very small positive number. This makes the function value a large positive number.\n**3. Determine the range:**\nSince the function can take on any value except 0, the range is all real numbers except 0. \n**4. Express the range in interval notation:**\nThe range of the function is **(-\u221e, 0) U (0, \u221e)**. \n",
        "Here's how to find the range of the function:\n**1. Understand the Domain:**\n* The function is undefined when the denominator is zero. So, we need to exclude the value *x = 1* from the domain.\n* The domain of the function is all real numbers except for 1. In interval notation, this is written as  (-\u221e, 1) \u222a (1, \u221e).\n**2. Consider the Behavior as x Approaches the Excluded Value:**\n* As *x* approaches 1 from the left (values slightly less than 1), the denominator becomes very small and negative.  Therefore, the function's value becomes very large and negative (approaching negative infinity).\n* As *x* approaches 1 from the right (values slightly greater than 1), the denominator becomes very small and positive. Therefore, the function's value becomes very large and positive (approaching positive infinity).\n**3. Consider the Behavior as x Approaches Positive and Negative Infinity:**\n* As *x* approaches negative infinity, the term *1-x* becomes very large.  The fraction 1/(1-x) approaches zero.\n* As *x* approaches positive infinity, the term *1-x* becomes very large and negative. The fraction 1/(1-x) approaches zero.\n**4. Combining the Information:**\n* The function can take on any value except for 0.  The function approaches both positive and negative infinity, and it can take on any value in between.\n**5. Expressing the Range in Interval Notation:**\n* The range of the function is **(-\u221e, 0) \u222a (0, \u221e)**. \n",
