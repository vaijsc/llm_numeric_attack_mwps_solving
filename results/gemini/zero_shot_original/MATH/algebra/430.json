    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "First, we can find the slope of the line through these two points.  The slope will be equal to: $$\\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}=\\frac{-2-6}{-4-(-2)}=\\frac{-8}{-2}=4$$ Therefore, the line will have the form $y=4x+b$.  To solve for $b$, substitute in one of the given points for $x$ and $y$ as shown: \\begin{align*}\n6&=4(-2)+b\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 6&=-8+b\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 14&=b\n\\end{align*} Since $b$ in a line of the form $y=mx+b$ is the $y$-intercept, and this is what we are trying to find, the answer is $\\boxed{14}$.",

Find the slope of the line:**\n* The slope of a line passing through points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by: (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n* In our case, (x1, y1) = (-2, 6) and (x2, y2) = (-4, -2)\n* Slope = (-2 - 6) / (-4 - (-2)) = -8 / -2 = 4\n**2.
