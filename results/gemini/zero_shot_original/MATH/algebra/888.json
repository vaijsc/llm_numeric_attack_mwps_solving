    "solution": "Vertical asymptotes occur at values of $x$ where the denominator is 0.  We can factor the denominator into $(x-7)(x+2)$, so the denominator equals 0 when $x=7$ or $x=-2$. Those $x$-values are where our vertical asymptotes are located.\n\nFor horizontal asymptotes, we look at the degree of $x$ in the numerator and the denominator. The degree of the numerator is 1, and the degree of the denominator is 2, so the denominator grows faster than the numerator for large values of $x$, and the function approaches the horizontal asymptote $y=0$. We can also see that when we divide $x$ out of the numerator and denominator, we get \\[\\frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} = \\frac{\\frac{2x}{x}}{\\frac{x^2-5x-14}{x}}=\\frac{2}{x-5-\\frac{14}{x}}.\\]As $x$ approaches infinity or negative infinity, the expression approaches 0.\n\nSo, our answer is $7 + (-2) + 0 = \\boxed{5}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the vertical asymptotes:**\n* **Factor the denominator:**  The denominator factors as $(x-7)(x+2)$.\n* **Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero:**  This happens at $x=7$ and $x=-2$.  Therefore, $a = -2$ and $b = 7$.\n**2. Find the horizontal asymptote:**\n* **Degree of numerator and denominator:** The degree of the numerator (1) is less than the degree of the denominator (2).\n* **Horizontal asymptote at y = 0:**  When the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is the line $y = 0$. So, $c = 0$.\n**3. Calculate a + b + c:**\n* $a + b + c = -2 + 7 + 0 = \\boxed{5}$ \n",
