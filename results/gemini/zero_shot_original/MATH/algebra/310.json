        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n1. **Find the midpoint formula:** The midpoint of a line segment with endpoints (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by:\n   ((x1 + x2)/2, (y1 + y2)/2)\n2. **Apply the formula:**  In our case, (x1, y1) = (3, 1) and (x2, y2) = (5, 1).  Substituting these values into the midpoint formula, we get:\n   ((3 + 5)/2, (1 + 1)/2) = (8/2, 2/2) = (4, 1)\n3. **Calculate the sum of the coordinates:** The sum of the coordinates of the midpoint (4, 1) is 4 + 1 = **5**. \n",
