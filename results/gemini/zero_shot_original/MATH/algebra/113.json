        "Here's how to express  $0.6\\overline{333}$ as a common fraction:\n**1. Set up an equation:**\nLet  *x* equal the decimal: \n   x = 0.6333...\n**2. Multiply to shift the decimal:**\nMultiply both sides of the equation by 10:\n   10x = 6.333...\n**3. Subtract the original equation:**\nSubtract the first equation (x = 0.6333...) from the second equation (10x = 6.333...):\n   10x = 6.333...\n   - x = 0.633...\n   ----------------\n    9x = 5.7\n**4. Solve for x:**\nDivide both sides by 9:\n   x = 5.7 / 9\n**5. Simplify:**\nSimplify the fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (which is 3):\n   x = **19/30**\nTherefore,  0.6333... is equivalent to the fraction **19/30**. \n",

Multiply to shift the decimal:**\nMultiply both sides of the equation by 10: \n  $10x = 6.\\overline{333}$\n**3. Multiply to align the repeating part:**\nMultiply both sides of the equation by 100:\n  $100x = 63.\\overline{333}$\n**4. Subtract the equations:**\nSubtract the equation in step 2 from the equation in step 3:\n  $100x - 10x = 63.\\overline{333} - 6.\\overline{333}$\n**5. Simplify and solve for x:**\nThis simplifies to:\n  $90x = 57$\n  $x = \\frac{57}{90}$\n**6. Reduce to lowest terms:**\nThe fraction can be reduced by dividing numerator and denominator by 3:\n  $x = \\boxed{\\frac{19}{30}}$\nTherefore, $0.6\\overline{333}$ is equivalent to $\\frac{19}{30}$. \n",
