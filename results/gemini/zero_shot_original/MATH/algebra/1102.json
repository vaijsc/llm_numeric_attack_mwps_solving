    "solution": "The expansion of $(x+m)^2-63$ is $x^2+2mx+m^2-63$, which has a constant term of $m^2-63$. This constant term must be equal to the constant term of the original quadratic, so $m^2-63 = 1$, which yields the possibilities $m=8$ and $m=-8$.\n\nIf $m=8$, then $(x+m)^2-63 = x^2+16x+1$. If $m=-8$, then $(x+m)^2-63 = x^2-16x+1$. Of these two possibilities, only the first conforms to our information that $b$ was a positive number. So, the original quadratic was $x^2+16x+1$, giving $b=\\boxed{16}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Expand the completed square form:**\nThe expression $(x+m)^2 - 63$ expands to: \n  \n  $x^2 + 2mx + m^2 - 63$\n**2. Match coefficients:**\nWe want this expanded form to be equal to our original quadratic, $x^2 + bx + 1$.  Matching the coefficients, we get:\n* **Coefficient of x:**  2m = b \n* **Constant term:** m\u00b2 - 63 = 1\n**3. Solve for m:**\nFrom the constant term equation, we have:\n* m\u00b2 = 64\n* m = \u00b18 \nSince b is positive, we choose m = 8.\n**4. Find b:**\nUsing the equation 2m = b and m = 8, we find:\n* b = 2 * 8 = 16\n**Therefore, b = 16** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand Completing the Square**\nCompleting the square is a technique used to rewrite a quadratic expression in the form $(x+m)^2 + n$. To do this, we manipulate the expression to create a perfect square trinomial. \n**2. Apply the Technique to Masha's Quadratic**\nMasha starts with the quadratic  $x^2 + bx + 1$. To complete the square, we follow these steps:\n* **Half the coefficient of the x term:**  Half of  *b* is *b/2*. \n* **Square the result:**  (b/2)^2 = b^2/4\n* **Add and Subtract:** Add and subtract  b^2/4  inside the expression:\n   \n   x^2 + bx + 1 + b^2/4 - b^2/4\n* **Factor the perfect square trinomial:** The first three terms form a perfect square:\n   \n   (x + b/2)^2 - b^2/4 + 1\n**3. Match Masha's Rewritten Form**\nWe're told Masha rewrites the quadratic as (x + m)^2 - 63.  Comparing this to our result, we see:\n* m = b/2\n* -b^2/4 + 1 = -63\n**4. Solve for b**\n* **Simplify the equation:** -b^2/4 + 1 = -63  becomes  -b^2/4 = -64\n* **Multiply both sides by -4:** b^2 = 256\n* **Take the square root of both sides:** b = 16  (We take the positive value since b is a positive number)\n**Therefore, b = 16** \n",

Matching Coefficients:**\n* We want this expanded form to be equal to our original quadratic, $x^2 + bx + 1$.  This means the coefficients of the corresponding terms must match:\n    *  The coefficient of the $x$ term:  $2m = b$\n    *  The constant term: $m^2 - 63 = 1$\n**3.

Finding b:**\n* Since *b* is positive, we use the positive value of *m*, which is 8.\n* Substitute *m* = 8 into the equation $2m = b$:\n    *  $2(8) = b$\n    *  $b = 16$\n**Therefore, b = 16.** \n",

Matching Coefficients**\nNow, we need to match this expanded form with the original quadratic, x\u00b2 + bx + 1:\n* The coefficient of x\u00b2 is already 1 in both expressions.\n* The coefficient of x in the expanded form is 2m, and in the original it's b. So,  2m = b\n* The constant term in the expanded form is m\u00b2 - 63, and in the original it's 1. So, m\u00b2 - 63 = 1\n**3. Solving for 'm'**\nLet's solve the equation m\u00b2 - 63 = 1 for 'm':\n* m\u00b2 = 64\n* m = \u00b18\n**4. Finding 'b'**\nSince we're told 'b' is positive, we'll use the positive value of 'm':  m = 8.\nNow, substitute m = 8 into the equation 2m = b:\n* 2 * 8 = b\n* b = 16\n**Therefore, b = 16** \n",
