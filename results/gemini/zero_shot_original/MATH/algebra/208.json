    "solution": "Let $d$ be the common difference, so $a = b - d$ and $c = b + d$.  We can assume that $d$ is positive.  (In particular, $d$ can't be 0, because the triangle is not equilateral.)  Then the perimeter of the triangle is $a + b + c = (b - d) + b + (b + d) = 3b = 60$, so $b = 20$.  Hence, the sides of the triangle are $20 - d$, 20, and $20 + d$.\n\nThese sides must satisfy the triangle inequality, which gives us \\[(20 - d) + 20 > 20 + d.\\] Solving for $d$, we find $2d < 20$, or $d < 10$.  Therefore, the possible values of $d$ are 1, 2, $\\dots$, 9, which gives us $\\boxed{9}$ possible triangles.",

        "Here's a step-by-step solution:\n**1. Understand Arithmetic Sequences**\nAn arithmetic sequence is a sequence where the difference between any two consecutive terms is constant.  In this case, we have an arithmetic sequence of side lengths:  $a$, $b$, and $c$, where $b = a + d$ and $c = a + 2d$ for some common difference *d*.\n**2. Use the Perimeter Condition**\nWe know the perimeter is 60 units:  $a + b + c = 60$.  Substitute the expressions for *b* and *c* in terms of *a* and *d*:\n* $a + (a + d) + (a + 2d) = 60$\n* $3a + 3d = 60$\n* $a + d = 20$\n**3. Consider Triangle Inequality**\nFor a triangle to be valid, the Triangle Inequality must hold:  the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side.  Let's apply this to our arithmetic sequence:\n* **a + b > c:**  This simplifies to $a > d$\n* **a + c > b:**  This simplifies to $a > -d$\n* **b + c > a:**  This simplifies to $2a + d > 0$\n**4. Solve for Possible Values of *d***\nSince we know $a + d = 20$, we can substitute to find the possible values of *d*:\n* $a > d$:  Since *a* + *d* = 20, *d* must be less than 10.\n* $a > -d$:  This is always true since *a* is a side length and must be positive.\n* $2a + d > 0$:  Substitute $a = 20 - d$ to get $40 - 2d + d > 0$, which simplifies to $d < 40$.\nCombining these inequalities, we know *d* must satisfy $0 < d < 10$.\n**5. Count the Distinct Triangles**\nWe can count the distinct triangles by considering the possible values of *d*.  For each value of *d* between 1 and 9 (exclusive), we get a unique triangle.  This gives us a total of **9** distinct triangles.\n**6. Exclude Equilateral Triangles**\nAn equilateral triangle has all sides equal, which means *d* would have to be 0. Since we're looking for *non-equilateral* triangles, we need to subtract 1 from our count.\n**Final Answer:** There are **9 - 1 = 8** distinct, non-equilateral triangles with a perimeter of 60 units and integer side lengths that form an arithmetic sequence. \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Conditions**\n* **Arithmetic Sequence:**  The side lengths  $a$, $b$, and $c$ form an arithmetic sequence. This means the difference between consecutive terms is constant. Let's call this common difference *d*. So we have:\n    *  $b = a + d$\n    *  $c = a + 2d$ \n* **Perimeter:** The perimeter is 60 units, meaning  $a + b + c = 60$.\n* **Non-Equilateral Triangle:** The triangle cannot have all sides equal (i.e., $a \\neq b \\neq c$).\n**2. Substitute and Simplify**\nSubstitute the expressions for *b* and *c* from the arithmetic sequence into the perimeter equation:\n*  $a + (a + d) + (a + 2d) = 60$\n*  $3a + 3d = 60$\n*  $a + d = 20$\n**3. Analyze the Triangle Inequality**\nThe Triangle Inequality Theorem states that the sum of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side.  We need to make sure this holds true for our triangle.\n*  $a + b > c  \\Rightarrow a + (a + d) > (a + 2d) \\Rightarrow a > d$\n*  $a + c > b  \\Rightarrow a + (a + 2d) > (a + d) \\Rightarrow a + d > 0$\n*  $b + c > a \\Rightarrow (a + d) + (a + 2d) > a \\Rightarrow a + 3d > 0$\nSince *a* and *d* are integers,  the last two inequalities are always true. We only need to focus on the first inequality:  *a > d*.\n**4. Find Possible Values of *a* and *d***\nWe know  $a + d = 20$. To satisfy the Triangle Inequality (*a > d*),  we need to find pairs of integers (*a*, *d*) where *a* is greater than *d*.  Here are the possibilities:\n*  (11, 9)\n*  (12, 8)\n*  (13, 7)\n*  (14, 6)\n*  (15, 5)\n*  (16, 4)\n*  (17, 3)\n*  (18, 2)\n*  (19, 1)\n**5. Count the Distinct Triangles**\nEach of the above pairs (*a*, *d*)  gives us a different set of side lengths for the triangle.  We have **9** distinct, non-equilateral triangles with integer side lengths that form an arithmetic sequence and have a perimeter of 60 units. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand Arithmetic Sequences**\nAn arithmetic sequence is a sequence where the difference between any two consecutive terms is constant.  Let the common difference be *d*.  This means our side lengths can be represented as:\n*  *a* = *b* - *d*\n*  *b* = *b* \n*  *c* = *b* + *d*\n**2. Apply the Triangle Inequality**\nThe Triangle Inequality Theorem states that the sum of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side.  We need to ensure this holds for our arithmetic sequence:\n*  *a* + *b* > *c*\n*  *a* + *c* > *b*\n*  *b* + *c* > *a*\n**3. Substitute and Simplify**\nLet's substitute our expressions from the arithmetic sequence into the Triangle Inequality:\n*  (*b* - *d*) + *b* > (*b* + *d*) \n*  (*b* - *d*) + (*b* + *d*) > *b*\n*  *b* + (*b* + *d*) > (*b* - *d*)\nSimplifying these inequalities, we get:\n*  *b* > *d*\n*  *b* > 0\n*  *b* + *d* > 0\n**4. Use the Perimeter Condition**\nWe know the perimeter is 60 units:\n*  *a* + *b* + *c* = 60\nSubstitute our arithmetic sequence expressions:\n*  (*b* - *d*) + *b* + (*b* + *d*) = 60\n*  3*b* = 60\n*  *b* = 20\n**5. Find Possible Values of *d***\nNow we know *b* = 20. Let's use the inequalities we derived from the Triangle Inequality:\n*  *b* > *d*  =>  20 > *d*\n*  *b* + *d* > 0  =>  20 + *d* > 0  => *d* > -20\nCombining these, we have -20 < *d* < 20.  However, *d* must be an integer to maintain integer side lengths.\n**6. Exclude Equilateral Triangles**\nWe want non-equilateral triangles. This means *d* cannot be 0.\n**7. Count the Distinct Triangles**\nSince *d* can be any integer from -19 to 19 (excluding 0), there are **38** possible distinct non-equilateral triangles. \n**Therefore, there are 38 distinct, non-equilateral triangles with a perimeter of 60 units and integer side lengths that form an arithmetic sequence.** \n",

Arithmetic Sequence**\n*  Since the side lengths form an arithmetic sequence, we can represent them as:\n    *  a = a\n    *  b = a + d\n    *  c = a + 2d\n**3. Perimeter and Arithmetic Sequence**\n* We know the perimeter is 60 units: a + (a + d) + (a + 2d) = 60\n* Simplifying the equation: 3a + 3d = 60\n* Dividing both sides by 3: a + d = 20\n**4. Applying the Triangle Inequality**\n* **Inequality 1:** a + (a + d) > (a + 2d)\n    * This simplifies to a > d\n* **Inequality 2:** (a + d) + (a + 2d) > a\n    * This simplifies to 2a + 3d > a, which is always true since a and d are positive.\n* **Inequality 3:** a + (a + 2d) > (a + d)\n    * This simplifies to a + d > 0, which is always true since a and d are positive.\n**5. Finding Possible Values of 'a' and 'd'**\n* We know a + d = 20 and a > d. \n* Let's start by trying different values for 'a':\n    * If a = 11, then d = 9, and the sides are 11, 20, 29. This satisfies all the conditions.\n    * If a = 12, then d = 8, and the sides are 12, 20, 28. This satisfies all the conditions.\n    * We can continue this process, but notice that as 'a' increases, 'd' decreases. \n    *  Eventually, 'd' will become smaller than 'a',  violating the condition a > d.\n**6. Listing the Possibilities**\n* The possible side lengths are:\n    * (11, 20, 29)\n    * (12, 20, 28)\n    * (13, 20, 27)\n    * ...\n    * (19, 20, 21)\n**7. Excluding Equilateral Triangles**\n* The triangle with sides (20, 20, 20) is an equilateral triangle, so we need to exclude it.\n**8.
