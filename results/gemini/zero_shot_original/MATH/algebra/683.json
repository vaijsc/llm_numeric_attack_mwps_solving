        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Problem:**\n* The worker wants to have $66,200 after three years.\n* He deposits $20,000 each year at the end of the year.\n* We need to find the minimum interest rate needed for this to happen.\n**2. Set Up the Equation:**\nLet 'r' be the annual interest rate (as a decimal).\n* **Year 1:** The worker deposits $20,000.\n* **Year 2:** The worker deposits another $20,000, and the previous year's deposit grows to $20,000 * (1 + r).\n* **Year 3:** The worker deposits $20,000, and the previous two years' deposits grow:\n    * $20,000 * (1 + r)^2 (from year 1)\n    * $20,000 * (1 + r) (from year 2)\nThe total amount at the end of year 3 is:\n$20,000 + 20,000(1 + r) + 20,000(1 + r)^2 = 66,200$\n**3. Solve the Equation:**\n* Divide both sides by 20,000:  1 + (1 + r) + (1 + r)^2 = 3.31\n* Let x = (1 + r).  The equation becomes: 1 + x + x^2 = 3.31\n* Rearrange: x^2 + x - 2.31 = 0\n* Use the quadratic formula to solve for x: \n   *  x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n   *  Where a = 1, b = 1, and c = -2.31\n*  Solve for the two possible values of x:\n    * x \u2248 1.1 \n    * x \u2248 -2.1 \nSince the interest rate cannot be negative, we discard the second solution.\n**4. Find the Interest Rate:**\n* Remember x = (1 + r)\n* So, 1.1 = (1 + r)\n* r = 0.1 \n**5. Convert to Percentage:**\n* Multiply r by 100%:  0.1 * 100% = 10%\n**Answer:** The minimal compound interest rate the savings account must provide is **10**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Set up the equation:**\nLet `r` be the annual interest rate (expressed as a decimal).  The worker's savings after three years can be represented by the following equation:\n$20000(1+r)^3 + 20000(1+r)^2 + 20000(1+r) = 66200$\n**2. Simplify the equation:**\nWe can factor out 20000(1+r) from the left side:\n$20000(1+r)[(1+r)^2 + (1+r) + 1] = 66200$\n**3. Solve for (1+r):**\nDivide both sides by 20000:\n$(1+r)[(1+r)^2 + (1+r) + 1] = 3.31$\nNow we need to find the value of (1+r) that satisfies this equation.  This is a cubic equation, and solving it directly can be complex. We can use trial and error or a numerical solver to find that  (1+r) \u2248 1.1.\n**4. Find the interest rate:**\nSince (1+r) = 1.1, we have:\nr = 1.1 - 1 = 0.1\n**5. Express as a percentage:**\nThe interest rate is 0.1, which is equivalent to **10%**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the problem:**\n* The worker wants to have $66,200 in his account after 3 years.\n* He contributes $20,000 each year at the end of the year.\n* We need to find the minimum interest rate that makes this possible.\n**2. Set up the equation:**\nLet 'r' be the annual interest rate (as a decimal).  We can use the formula for compound interest:\n* **A = P(1 + r)^n** \nWhere:\n* **A** = the final amount (desired $66,200)\n* **P** = the principal (the sum of his deposits)\n* **r** = the annual interest rate (unknown)\n* **n** = the number of years (3)\n**3. Calculate the principal:**\n* The worker deposits $20,000 each year for 3 years, so the principal is: P = $20,000 + $20,000 + $20,000 = $60,000\n**4. Plug the values into the equation:**\n* $66,200 = $60,000(1 + r)^3\n**5. Solve for 'r':**\n* Divide both sides by $60,000:  1.10333 = (1 + r)^3\n* Take the cube root of both sides:  1.0333 = 1 + r\n* Subtract 1 from both sides: r = 0.0333\n**6. Convert to a percentage:**\n* Multiply by 100%: 0.0333 * 100% = 3.33%\n**Answer:** The minimal compound interest rate that the savings account must provide is **3.33**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the problem:**\n* The worker deposits $20,000 each year for three years.\n* He wants a total of $66,200 after the third deposit.\n* We need to find the minimum interest rate that will achieve this.\n**2. Set up the equation:**\nLet  'r' be the annual interest rate (expressed as a decimal).  We can use the formula for the future value of an ordinary annuity:\n* **FV = P * [(1 + r)^n - 1] / r**\nWhere:\n* FV = Future value (the amount he wants - $66,200)\n* P = Periodic payment (annual deposit - $20,000)\n* r = Interest rate (what we need to find)\n* n = Number of periods (years - 3)\n**3. Substitute and solve:**\n* $66,200 = $20,000 * [(1 + r)^3 - 1] / r \nWe need to solve for 'r'. This equation is a bit tricky to solve directly, so we'll use a numerical approach:\n* **Trial and Error:**  Start by trying different interest rates (r) and see if the future value (FV) gets close to $66,200. You can use a calculator or spreadsheet to do this.\n* **Using a Financial Calculator or Spreadsheet:**  Most financial calculators and spreadsheets have functions to solve for interest rate (often denoted as \"IRR\" or \"RATE\"). Input the values, and the calculator will solve for the interest rate.\n**4. Solution:**\nUsing either trial and error or a financial calculator, you'll find that the minimal compound interest rate needed is approximately **5%**.\n**Therefore, the answer is 5.** \n",
