    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since the square of $x-4$ is at most 9, the value of $x-4$ must be between $-3$ and $3$ (or equal to either). So, we have $-3 \\le x-4 \\le 3$. Thus, $1 \\le x \\le 7$. Therefore, our answer is $\\boxed{6}$.\n\n- OR -\n\nIf $(x-4)^2 \\le 9$, then $x$ can be no more than 3 away from 4.  Therefore, the values of $x$ from 1 to 7 satisfy the inequality, and our answer is $\\boxed{6}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n1. **Take the square root of both sides:** \n   Since we have a squared term, we can take the square root of both sides of the inequality:\n   \u221a[(x-4)\u00b2] \u2264 \u221a9\n2. **Simplify:**\n   This gives us:\n   |x - 4| \u2264 3 \n3. **Solve for the absolute value:**\n   The absolute value of an expression is its distance from zero.  This means we have two possible cases:\n   *  x - 4 \u2264 3 \n   *  -(x - 4) \u2264 3 \n4. **Solve each case:**\n   * **Case 1:**  x - 4 \u2264 3  =>  x \u2264 7\n   * **Case 2:** -(x - 4) \u2264 3  => x - 4 \u2265 -3 => x \u2265 1\n5. **Combine the solutions:**\n   The solutions satisfy  1 \u2264 x \u2264 7.\n6. **Find the length:**\n   The length of the segment on the number line is the difference between the endpoints: 7 - 1 = **6**. \n**Therefore, the length of the segment of the number line consisting of the points that satisfy (x-4)\u00b2 \u2264 9 is 6.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Inequality:**\n* The inequality $(x-4)^2 \\le 9$ represents all the values of *x* that, when subtracted from 4 and then squared, result in a number less than or equal to 9.\n**2. Take the Square Root:**\n* To isolate *x*, take the square root of both sides of the inequality.

Solve for x:**\n*  The absolute value of a number represents its distance from zero.  So, the inequality means that the distance between *x* and 4 is less than or equal to 3.  This can be written as two separate inequalities:\n    *  x - 4 \u2264 3  and  x - 4 \u2265 -3\n* Solve for *x* in each inequality:\n    * x \u2264 7  and  x \u2265 1\n**4.
