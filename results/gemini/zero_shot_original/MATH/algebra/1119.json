    "problem": "If the fourth term of an arithmetic sequence is $200$ and the eighth term is $500$, what is the sixth term?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The sixth term is exactly halfway between the fourth and the eighth in the arithmetic sequence, so it is the average of the two terms. Therefore, the sixth term is $(200 + 500)/2 = \\boxed{350}$.  We also could have found the common difference by noting that there are four steps between the fourth term and the eighth term.  So, if $d$ is the common difference, we have $4d = 500-200 = 300$. Therefore, we find $d=75$.  The sixth term is two steps after the fourth, or $200 + 2d = \\boxed{350}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand Arithmetic Sequences**\nAn arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers where the difference between any two consecutive terms is constant. This constant difference is called the common difference.\n**2.  Set Up Equations**\n* Let the first term be 'a' and the common difference be 'd'.\n* The fourth term is a + 3d = 200\n* The eighth term is a + 7d = 500\n**3. Solve for 'd' (the common difference)**\n* Subtract the first equation from the second equation: (a + 7d) - (a + 3d) = 500 - 200\n* This simplifies to 4d = 300\n* Therefore, d = 75\n**4. Solve for 'a' (the first term)**\n* Substitute d = 75 into the equation a + 3d = 200\n* This gives us a + 3(75) = 200\n* Solving for 'a', we get a = 25\n**5. Find the Sixth Term**\n* The sixth term is a + 5d = 25 + 5(75) = 400\n**Answer:** The sixth term of the arithmetic sequence is **400**. \n",

This constant difference is called the common difference.\n**2. Set up Equations**\n* Let the first term of the sequence be 'a' and the common difference be 'd'.\n* The fourth term is given as 200, so:  a + 3d = 200 \n* The eighth term is given as 500, so: a + 7d = 500\n**3. Solve the System of Equations**\nWe now have two equations with two unknowns.  We can solve for 'a' and 'd' using elimination or substitution.\n* **Elimination:** Subtract the first equation from the second equation:\n   (a + 7d) - (a + 3d) = 500 - 200\n   4d = 300\n   d = 75\n* **Substitute:** Substitute the value of 'd' back into either of the original equations to solve for 'a'.  Let's use the first equation:\n   a + 3(75) = 200\n   a + 225 = 200\n   a = -25\n**4. Find the Sixth Term**\nNow that we know 'a' and 'd', we can find the sixth term:\n* Sixth term = a + 5d \n* Sixth term = -25 + 5(75)\n* Sixth term = -25 + 375\n* Sixth term = 350\n**Therefore, the sixth term of the arithmetic sequence is 350.** \n",
