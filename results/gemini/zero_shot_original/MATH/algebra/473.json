    "problem": "My usual workout consists of running 10 laps around a 400 meter track. If I go to a track that is only 250 meters long, how many laps will I need to run to get the same workout?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since the total distance that I run is constant, the length of each lap and the total number of laps are inversely proportional. Consequently, if each lap is $\\frac{250}{400}=\\frac{5}{8}$ as long, I need to run $\\frac{8}{5}$ as many laps, so our answer is $\\frac{8}{5}\\cdot10=\\boxed{16}$ laps.",

        "Here's how to solve this:\n**1. Calculate the total distance of your usual workout:**\n* 10 laps * 400 meters/lap = 4000 meters\n**2. Determine how many laps you need on the shorter track:**\n* 4000 meters / 250 meters/lap = 16 laps\n**Answer:** You will need to run 16 laps on the 250-meter track to get the same workout. \n",
