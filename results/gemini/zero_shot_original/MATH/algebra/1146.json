        "Here's how to solve this step-by-step:\n* **Aiden received 1 car for his first birthday, 2 cars for his second, and so on.**  This means he follows a pattern of adding one more car each year.\n* **We need to find the total number of cars he has after his 12th birthday.** This means we need to sum the number of cars he received each year from 1 to 12.\n**There's a handy formula for this:**\nThe sum of consecutive numbers from 1 to n is  n * (n + 1) / 2\n**Let's apply it:**\n* n = 12 (Aiden's age)\n* Total cars = 12 * (12 + 1) / 2\n* Total cars = 12 * 13 / 2\n* Total cars = 78\n**Therefore, Aiden will have received a total of 78 toy cars from Jo.** \n",
