    "solution": "We don't know $g(x),$ so we don't have an expression we can simply stick $4$ in to get an answer. We do, however, know that $g(f(x)) = 5-4x.$ So, if we can figure out what to put into $f(x)$ such that $4$ is output, we can use our expression for $g(f(x))$ to find $g(4).$\n\nSince $f(x) = 2x-3,$ the value of $x$ such that $f(x) = 4$ is the solution to the equation $2x-3 = 4,$ which is $x = 7/2.$ So, we have $f(7/2) = 4.$ Therefore, if we let $x=7/2$ in $g(f(x)) = 5-4x,$ we have \\[g(f(7/2)) = 5-4\\cdot\\frac{7}{2} \\implies g(4) = 5-14 = \\boxed{-9}.\\]",
