    "solution": "For the product of two factors to be negative, one of the factors must be positive and one of the factors must be negative. Since $x-5<x+5$ for all $x$, we know that $x$ satisfies $(x-5)(x+5)<0$ if and only if $$x-5 < 0 < x+5.$$ The first inequality, $x-5<0$, tells us that $x<5$. The second inequality, $0<x+5$, tells us that $x>-5$. Thus the solutions to the original inequality are given by $-5<x<5$.\n\nThe smallest integer in this interval is $x=\\boxed{-4}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the inequality step-by-step:\n**1. Find the critical points:**\n* The inequality is zero when  (x - 5) = 0 or (x + 5) = 0. \n* Solving these equations, we get x = 5 and x = -5. These are our critical points.\n**2. Test intervals:**\n* The critical points divide the number line into three intervals:\n    * x < -5\n    * -5 < x < 5\n    * x > 5\n* **Interval 1 (x < -5):** Choose a test value in this interval, say x = -6. Substitute it into the inequality:\n    (-6 - 5)(-6 + 5) = (-11)(-1) = 11 > 0. The inequality is not satisfied.\n* **Interval 2 (-5 < x < 5):** Choose a test value, say x = 0. Substitute it into the inequality:\n    (0 - 5)(0 + 5) = (-5)(5) = -25 < 0. The inequality is satisfied.\n* **Interval 3 (x > 5):** Choose a test value, say x = 6. Substitute it into the inequality:\n    (6 - 5)(6 + 5) = (1)(11) = 11 > 0. The inequality is not satisfied.\n**3. Solution:**\n* The inequality is satisfied only in the interval -5 < x < 5. \n**4.

        "Here's how to solve the inequality step-by-step:\n**1. Find the critical points:**\n* The inequality is equal to zero when  (x-5) = 0 or (x+5) = 0.\n* Solving for x, we get x = 5 and x = -5.

Test intervals:**\n* Our critical points divide the number line into three intervals:\n    * x < -5\n    * -5 < x < 5\n    * x > 5\n* We need to test a value within each interval to see if it satisfies the inequality:\n    * **x < -5:** Let's try x = -6.
