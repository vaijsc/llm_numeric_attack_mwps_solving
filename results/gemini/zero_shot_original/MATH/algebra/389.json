    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We begin by factoring the denominator: $y=\\frac{x+1}{(x-1)^2}$. There is a vertical asymptote at $x=a$ for a rational function if the denominator is zero when $x=a$ (except when $x-a$ is also a factor of the numerator and has the same multiplicity as it does in the denominator). The only value of $x$ where that occurs is $x=\\boxed{1}$.",

        "Here's how to find the vertical asymptotes:\n**1. Factor the denominator:**\nThe denominator,  $x^2 - 2x + 1$, factors as $(x-1)^2$.\n**2. Identify values that make the denominator zero:**\nThe denominator is zero when $(x-1)^2 = 0$.  This occurs when $x = 1$.\n**3. Check if the numerator is also zero at the same value:**\nThe numerator, $x+1$, is not zero when $x=1$. \n**4. Conclusion:**\nSince the denominator is zero at $x=1$ and the numerator is not zero at $x=1$, there is a **vertical asymptote at  x = 1**. \n**Explanation:**\nVertical asymptotes occur where the function approaches infinity. This happens when the denominator approaches zero while the numerator doesn't. In this case, as $x$ gets closer and closer to 1, the denominator gets very small, making the fraction very large. \n",
        "Here's how to find the vertical asymptotes:\n**1. Factor the denominator:**\nThe denominator of the function is a quadratic expression:  \n  \n  x\u00b2 - 2x + 1 = (x - 1)\u00b2\n**2. Identify the values that make the denominator zero:**\nThe denominator is zero when (x - 1) = 0, which means x = 1.\n**3. Check for cancellation:**\nNotice that the numerator (x + 1) does *not* have a factor of (x - 1). This means the factor (x - 1) in the denominator does not cancel out.\n**4. Conclusion:**\nSince the denominator becomes zero at x = 1 and the factor doesn't cancel out, there is a **vertical asymptote** at **x = 1**. \n",
