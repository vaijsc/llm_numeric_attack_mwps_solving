    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We notice that the numerator of the fraction factors into $(3x-1)(x-1)$. Substituting this into the given expression, we get $m=\\dfrac{3x^2-4x+1}{x-1} = \\dfrac{(3x-1)(x-1)}{x-1}$. This simplifies to $m=3x-1$ if $x$ is not 1. Thus, $m$ can be any real number except for the value it takes when $x$ is $1.$ This value is $3(1)-1=3-1=\\boxed{2}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Factor the numerator:**\nThe numerator of the fraction is a quadratic expression.  We can factor it: \n \n  3x\u00b2 - 4x + 1 = (3x - 1)(x - 1)\n**2. Simplify the expression:**\nNow we can rewrite the original equation:\n  (3x - 1)(x - 1) / (x - 1) = m\nSince x \u2260 1, we can cancel the (x - 1) terms:\n  3x - 1 = m\n**3. Solve for x:**\n  3x = m + 1\n  x = (m + 1) / 3\n**4. Determine the excluded value for m:**\nThe original problem states that x cannot be equal to 1.  Let's find the value of *m* that would make *x* equal to 1:\n  1 = (m + 1) / 3\n  3 = m + 1\n  m = 2\n**Answer:**\nTherefore, the only real value that *m* cannot have is **m = 2**. \n",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step by step:\n**1. Understand the problem:**\nWe are given a rational expression (a fraction with polynomials) and an equation that relates it to a variable 'm'. We need to find the values of 'm' that are *impossible* to achieve, given the restriction on 'x' (x cannot be 1).\n**2. Factor the numerator:**\nThe numerator of the rational expression factors: \n \n $$3x^2 - 4x + 1 = (3x - 1)(x - 1)$$\n**3.

Analyze the result:**\nThe equation  3x - 1 = m tells us that for any value of 'x' (except 1), we can find a corresponding value of 'm'.  This means there are no restrictions on 'm'.\n**5. Conclusion:**\nTherefore, there are **no real values** that 'm' cannot have.  \n**In other words, 'm' can take on any real number.** \n",
