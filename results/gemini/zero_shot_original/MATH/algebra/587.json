        "Here's how to solve the inequality and find the value of a + b:\n**1. Distribute:**\n   Start by distributing the 2 on the right side of the inequality:\n   \n   -4 < 2x - 2 < 8\n**2. Isolate x:**\n   * Add 2 to all parts of the inequality:\n      -2 < 2x < 10\n   * Divide all parts of the inequality by 2:\n      -1 < x < 5\n**3. Identify a and b:**\n   Now we see that the solution is in the form a < x < b, where:\n   * a = -1\n   * b = 5\n**4. Calculate a + b:**\n   a + b = -1 + 5 = 4\n**Therefore, the value of a + b is 4.** \n",
