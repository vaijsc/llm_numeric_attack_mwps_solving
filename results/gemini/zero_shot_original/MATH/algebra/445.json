The only pairs of factors of $17$ are $(17,1)$ and $(-17,-1)$. Thus we have that the coordinates satisfy one of the following four systems: (i) $x+y=17$, $x-y=1$; (ii)  $x+y=-17$, $x-y=-1$; (iii) $x+y=1$, $x-y=17$; (iv) $x+y=-1$, $x-y=-17$.  Solving each of these $4$ systems individually gives exactly one solution in each integers for each system.  Thus there are $\\boxed{4}$ lattice points on the hyperbola.",

        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Equation**\nThe equation $x^2 - y^2 = 17$ represents a hyperbola. The standard form of a hyperbola centered at the origin is:\n*  $\\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$\nIn our case, we can rewrite the equation as:\n* $\\frac{x^2}{17} - \\frac{y^2}{17} = 1$\nThis tells us that the hyperbola has its center at the origin, and its vertices are at $(\\sqrt{17}, 0)$ and $(-\\sqrt{17}, 0)$.\n**2. Factor the Equation**\nWe can factor the original equation using the difference of squares pattern:\n* $(x+y)(x-y) = 17$\n**3. Find the Factors of 17**\nSince 17 is a prime number, its only factors are 1 and 17.  Therefore, we have the following possibilities:\n*  $x + y = 17$ and $x - y = 1$\n*  $x + y = 1$ and $x - y = 17$\n**4. Solve the Systems of Equations**\nLet's solve each system of equations:\n* **System 1:**\n   *  $x + y = 17$\n   *  $x - y = 1$\n   Adding the equations, we get $2x = 18$, so $x = 9$. Substituting back into either equation, we find $y = 8$. \n* **System 2:**\n   * $x + y = 1$\n   * $x - y = 17$\n   Adding the equations, we get $2x = 18$, so $x = 9$. Substituting back into either equation, we find $y = -8$.\n**5. Identify Lattice Points**\nThe solutions we found are $(9, 8)$ and $(9, -8)$.  Since both coordinates are integers, these are lattice points.\n**Answer:** There are **two** lattice points on the hyperbola $x^2 - y^2 = 17$. \n",
