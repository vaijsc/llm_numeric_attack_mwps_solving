    "problem": "The sum of 5 consecutive even integers is 4 less than the sum of the first 8 consecutive odd counting numbers. What is the smallest of the even integers?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The first 8 odd positive integers are 1, 3, $\\dots$, 15.  The sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, so their sum is $(1 + 15)/2 \\cdot 8 = 64$.\n\nLet the 5 consecutive even integers be $a$, $a + 2$, $a + 4$, $a + 6$, and $a + 8$.  Their sum is $5a + 20$.  But this is also $64 - 4 = 60$, so $5a + 20 = 60$.  Solving for $a$, we find $a = \\boxed{8}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Express the even integers:**\n* Let the smallest even integer be represented by  'x'.\n* The next four consecutive even integers are: x + 2, x + 4, x + 6, and x + 8\n**2. Express the odd integers:**\n* The first odd integer is 1.\n* The next seven consecutive odd integers are: 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15.\n**3. Set up the equation:**\n* **Sum of even integers:** x + (x + 2) + (x + 4) + (x + 6) + (x + 8) \n* **Sum of odd integers:** 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15\n* **The problem states:** The sum of the even integers is 4 less than the sum of the odd integers.  \n* **Equation:** 5x + 20 = (1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15) - 4\n**4. Simplify and solve for x:**\n* **Simplify the sum of odd integers:** 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 = 64\n* **The equation becomes:** 5x + 20 = 64 - 4\n* **Combine like terms:** 5x + 20 = 60\n* **Subtract 20 from both sides:** 5x = 40\n* **Divide both sides by 5:** x = 8\n**Therefore, the smallest of the even integers is 8.** \n",
