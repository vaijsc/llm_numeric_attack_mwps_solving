        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find 50% of 80:**\n* 50% is the same as 0.5 (divide the percentage by 100).\n* Multiply 0.5 by 80: 0.5 * 80 = 40\n**2. Find 20% of 40:**\n* 20% is the same as 0.2.\n* Multiply 0.2 by 40: 0.2 * 40 = 8\n**Therefore, 20% of 50% of 80 is 8.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this step-by-step:\n1. **Find 50% of 80:** \n   * 50% is the same as 0.50 (or 1/2)\n   * 0.50 * 80 = 40\n2. **Find 20% of 40:**\n   * 20% is the same as 0.20 (or 1/5)\n   * 0.20 * 40 = 8\n**Therefore, 20% of 50% of 80 is 8.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this step-by-step:\n1. **Find 50% of 80:** \n   * 50% is the same as half, so 50% of 80 is 80 / 2 = 40\n2. **Find 20% of 40:**\n   * 20% is one-fifth, so 20% of 40 is 40 / 5 = 8\n**Therefore, 20% of 50% of 80 is 8.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this step by step:\n1. **Calculate 50% of 80:**  50% is the same as half, so half of 80 is 40.\n2. **Calculate 20% of 40:**  20% is one-fifth, so one-fifth of 40 is 8.\n**Therefore, 20% of 50% of 80 is 8.** \n",
