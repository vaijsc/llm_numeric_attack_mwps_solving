        "Here's how to simplify the expression:\n**1. Simplify the radical:**\n*  The square root of 27 can be simplified because 27 has a perfect square factor: \n   *  27 = 9 * 3\n   *  \u221a27 = \u221a(9 * 3) = \u221a9 * \u221a3 = 3\u221a3\n**2. Substitute and simplify:**\n* Now our expression is: 3 / (3\u221a3) \n*  The 3's in the numerator and denominator cancel out, leaving: **1/\u221a3**\n**3. Rationalize the denominator (optional):**\n* To get rid of the radical in the denominator, multiply both numerator and denominator by \u221a3:\n   * (1/\u221a3) * (\u221a3/\u221a3) = \u221a3 / 3\n**Therefore, the simplified forms of the expression are:**\n* **1/\u221a3** \n* **\u221a3 / 3** \n",
