    "problem": "Josh and Mike live 13 miles apart. Yesterday Josh started to ride his bicycle toward Mike's house. A little later Mike started to ride his bicycle toward Josh's house. When they met, Josh had ridden for twice the length of time as Mike and at four-fifths of Mike's rate. How many miles had  Mike ridden when they met?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Because $\\text{(rate)(time)} = \\text{(distance)}$, the distance Josh rode was $(4/5)(2) = 8/5$ of the distance that Mike rode.  Let $m$ be the number of miles that Mike had ridden when they met. Then the number of miles between their houses is \\[\n13 = m + \\frac{8}{5}m = \\frac{13}{5}m.\n\\]Thus $m = \\boxed{5}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Define Variables**\n* Let  'x' be the distance Mike rode when they met.\n* Since Josh rode twice as long as Mike, let '2x' be the distance Josh rode when they met.\n**2. Set Up an Equation**\n* The total distance they rode together is 13 miles:  x + 2x = 13\n**3. Solve for x**\n* Combine like terms: 3x = 13\n* Divide both sides by 3: x = 13/3 \n**4. The Answer**\n* Mike had ridden **13/3 miles** (or approximately 4.33 miles) when they met. \n",

Set up variables:**\n* Let  'x' be the distance Mike rode when they met.\n* Since Josh rode twice as long as Mike, let '2x' be the distance Josh rode.\n**2.  Understand the relationship between distance, rate, and time:**\n* **Distance = Rate x Time**\n**3. Express Josh's rate in terms of Mike's rate:**\n* Josh's rate is four-fifths of Mike's rate, so Josh's rate is (4/5) * Mike's rate.\n**4.  Set up an equation:**\n* The total distance Josh and Mike rode is 13 miles: \n   x + 2x = 13\n**5. Solve for x:**\n* Combine like terms: 3x = 13\n* Divide both sides by 3: x = 13/3 \n**6.

Define Variables**\n* Let  'x' be the number of miles Mike rode.\n* Let 't' be the time Mike rode.\n* Since Josh rode for twice the time as Mike, Josh rode for '2t' hours.\n* Josh's speed is 4/5 of Mike's speed.\n**2. Set Up Equations**\n* **Distance = Speed x Time**\n   * Mike's distance: x = t * (Mike's speed)\n   * Josh's distance: 13 - x = 2t * (4/5 * Mike's speed)\n**3. Solve for x (Mike's Distance)**\n* Notice that both equations have 'Mike's speed' in them.  We can use substitution to eliminate it.\n* From Mike's distance equation, we get: (Mike's speed) = x/t\n* Substitute this into Josh's distance equation: 13 - x = 2t * (4/5 * x/t)\n* Simplify: 13 - x = (8/5)x\n* Combine 'x' terms: 13 = (13/5)x\n* Solve for x: x = 5 miles\n**Answer:** Mike had ridden **5 miles** when they met. \n",

Use the formula: distance = speed x time**\n* **For Mike:** x = r * t (where 't' is the time Mike rode)\n* **For Josh:** 13 - x = (4/5)r * 2t \n**3. Simplify the equations:**\n* Since we know Josh rode for twice as long as Mike, we can rewrite the second equation as: 13 - x = (4/5)r * (2 * t) = (8/5)rt\n**4. Substitute the first equation into the second equation:**\n* 13 - x = (8/5) * x  (since rt = x from the first equation)\n**5.
