        "To find the sixth term, we need to determine the common ratio of the geometric sequence.  The common ratio is the factor by which we multiply each term to get the next term.\nDividing any term by the previous term gives us the common ratio: \n$$\\frac{9/25}{27/125} = \\frac{9}{25} \\cdot \\frac{125}{27} = \\frac{5}{3}.$$\nTo find the sixth term, we can start with the third term, $\\frac{3}{5}$, and multiply by the common ratio $\\frac{5}{3}$ four times:\n$$\\frac{3}{5} \\cdot \\frac{5}{3} \\cdot \\frac{5}{3} \\cdot \\frac{5}{3} \\cdot \\frac{5}{3} = \\boxed{\\frac{125}{27}}.$$ \n",
        "**1. Find the common ratio:**\n* Divide any term by the term before it to find the common ratio.  Let's divide the second term by the first term: \n  \n   (9/25) / (27/125) = (9/25) * (125/27) = 5/3\n**2. Determine the sixth term:**\n* We know the first term is 27/125 and the common ratio is 5/3.  \n* To find the sixth term, we multiply the first term by the common ratio raised to the power of 5 (since we want the 6th term and we already know the first).\n* Sixth term = (27/125) * (5/3)^5 = (27/125) * (3125/243) = **25/3** \n**Therefore, the sixth term in the geometric sequence is 25/3.** \n",

Find the sixth term:**\n* The general form of a geometric sequence is  a * r^(n-1), where 'a' is the first term, 'r' is the common ratio, and 'n' is the term number.\n* In this case, a = 27/125 and r = 5/3.
