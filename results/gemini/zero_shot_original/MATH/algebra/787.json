    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We have $f(3m) = (3m)^2 + 12 = 9m^2 + 12$, so $f(3m) = 3f(m)$ gives us $9m^2 + 12 = 3(m^2 + 12)$.  Expanding the right side gives $9m^2 +12 = 3m^2 + 36$. Simplifying gives $6m^2 = 24$, so $m^2 = 4$.  Since we are given that $m>0$, we have $m = \\boxed{2}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n1. **Substitute into the equation:** We're given that  *f(x) = x\u00b2 + 12*. Let's substitute *3m* and *m* into the function:\n   *  *f(3m) = (3m)\u00b2 + 12 = 9m\u00b2 + 12*\n   *  *f(m) = m\u00b2 + 12*\n2. **Set up the equation:** We are told that *f(3m) = 3(f(m))*.  Substitute the expressions we found in step 1:\n   *  *9m\u00b2 + 12 = 3(m\u00b2 + 12)*\n3. **Solve for *m*:** \n   * Expand the right side: 9m\u00b2 + 12 = 3m\u00b2 + 36\n   * Subtract 3m\u00b2 from both sides: 6m\u00b2 + 12 = 36\n   * Subtract 12 from both sides: 6m\u00b2 = 24\n   * Divide both sides by 6: m\u00b2 = 4\n   * Take the square root of both sides: m = \u00b12\n4. **Consider the condition:** We were given that *m > 0*. Therefore, the only valid solution is **m = 2**. \n",
