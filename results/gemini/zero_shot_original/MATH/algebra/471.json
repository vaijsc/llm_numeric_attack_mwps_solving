    "solution": "Since 6 cookies cost the same as 2 brownies, 18 cookies will cost the same as 6 brownies.  Similarly, 4 brownies cost the same as 10 cupcakes, so 6 brownies will cost the same as $10\\cdot \\frac{6}{4} = 15$ cupcakes.  Therefore, 18 cookies have the same price as $\\boxed{15}$ cupcakes.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the relationship between cookies and brownies:**\n*  We know 6 cookies = 2 brownies.\n*  To find the price of one brownie in terms of cookies, divide both sides by 2: 3 cookies = 1 brownie.\n**2. Find the relationship between brownies and cupcakes:**\n* We know 4 brownies = 10 cupcakes.\n* To find the price of one cupcake in terms of brownies, divide both sides by 10: 0.4 brownies = 1 cupcake.\n**3. Find the relationship between cookies and cupcakes:**\n* We know 3 cookies = 1 brownie and 0.4 brownies = 1 cupcake.\n* Substitute the value of a brownie in terms of cookies into the cupcake equation:  0.4 * (3 cookies) = 1 cupcake\n* This simplifies to: 1.2 cookies = 1 cupcake\n**4. Calculate how many cupcakes Bob can buy with 18 cookies:**\n* Divide the number of cookies Bob has (18) by the number of cookies needed for one cupcake (1.2): 18 cookies / 1.2 cookies/cupcake = 15 cupcakes\n**Answer:** Bob can buy **15** cupcakes for the price of eighteen cookies. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the relationship between cookies and brownies:**\n* 6 cookies = 2 brownies\n* This means 3 cookies = 1 brownie (divide both sides by 2)\n**2. Find the relationship between brownies and cupcakes:**\n* 4 brownies = 10 cupcakes\n**3. Find the relationship between cookies and cupcakes:**\n* Since 1 brownie = 3 cookies, we can substitute that into the brownie-cupcake relationship:\n    * 4 * (3 cookies) = 10 cupcakes\n    * 12 cookies = 10 cupcakes\n**4. Determine how many cupcakes Bob can buy with 18 cookies:**\n* We know 12 cookies = 10 cupcakes.  \n* To find out how many cupcakes 18 cookies buys, set up a proportion:\n    * 12 cookies / 10 cupcakes = 18 cookies / x cupcakes\n* Cross-multiply: \n    * 12x = 180\n* Solve for x:\n    * x = 180 / 12\n    * x = 15\n**Answer:** Bob can buy **15** cupcakes for the price of eighteen cookies. \n",

Determine how many cupcakes Bob can buy with 18 cookies:**\n* We know 12 cookies = 10 cupcakes.\n*  Since 18 is 1.5 times bigger than 12 (18 / 12 = 1.5), Bob can buy 1.5 times the number of cupcakes:\n    * 1.5 * 10 cupcakes = 15 cupcakes\n**Answer:** Bob can buy **15** cupcakes for the price of eighteen cookies. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the cookie-to-brownie ratio:**\n* 6 cookies = 2 brownies \n* This means 3 cookies = 1 brownie (divide both sides by 2)\n**2. Find the brownie-to-cupcake ratio:**\n* 4 brownies = 10 cupcakes \n* This means 2 brownies = 5 cupcakes (divide both sides by 2)\n**3.  Relate cookies to cupcakes:**\n* Since 3 cookies = 1 brownie and 2 brownies = 5 cupcakes, we can combine these ratios:\n* 6 cookies = 5 cupcakes (multiply the first ratio by 2)\n**4. Determine how many cupcakes 18 cookies buy:**\n* We know 6 cookies = 5 cupcakes.\n* 18 cookies is 3 times the amount of 6 cookies (18 / 6 = 3).\n* Therefore, 18 cookies will buy 3 times the number of cupcakes: 5 cupcakes * 3 = 15 cupcakes\n**Answer:** Bob can buy **15** cupcakes for the price of eighteen cookies. \n",
