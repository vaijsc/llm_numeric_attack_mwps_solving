        "Here's how to solve the equation step-by-step:\n1. **Simplify using exponent properties:**\n   -  Notice that  $4^x = (2^2)^x = 2^{2x}$\n   - Rewrite the equation:  $(2^x-2)(5\\cdot2^x+10) = 3\\cdot2^{2x} + 12$\n2. **Factor out constants:**\n   - Factor out a 5 from the left side: $(2^x-2)(5(2^x+2)) = 3\\cdot2^{2x} + 12$\n   - Factor out a 3 from the right side: $(2^x-2)(5(2^x+2)) = 3(2^{2x} + 4)$\n3. **Make a substitution:**\n   - Let  $y = 2^x$.  This simplifies the equation:\n     $(y-2)(5(y+2)) = 3(y^2 + 4)$\n4. **Expand and simplify:**\n   - Expand both sides: $5y^2 + 10y - 10y - 20 = 3y^2 + 12$\n   - Combine like terms:  $2y^2 - 32 = 0$\n5. **Solve for y:**\n   - Divide both sides by 2: $y^2 - 16 = 0$\n   - Factor the difference of squares: $(y+4)(y-4) = 0$\n   -  Therefore,  $y = 4$ or $y = -4$\n6. **Solve for x:**\n   - Remember that $y = 2^x$.\n   - If $y = 4$, then $2^x = 4$ which means $x = 2$\n   - If $y = -4$, then $2^x = -4$ which has no real solution since any positive number raised to any power is always positive.\n**Therefore, the solution to the equation is x = 2.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the equation step-by-step:\n1. **Simplify the equation:**\n   *  Notice that $4^x = (2^2)^x = 2^{2x}$. \n   *  Distribute on the left side: \n      *  $(2^x - 2)(5\\cdot2^x + 10) = 5\\cdot2^{2x} + 10\\cdot2^x - 10\\cdot2^x - 20 = 5\\cdot2^{2x} - 20$\n   Now the equation becomes: \n   *  $5\\cdot2^{2x} - 20 = 3\\cdot2^{2x} + 12$\n2. **Isolate the terms with  $2^{2x}$:**\n   *  Subtract $3\\cdot2^{2x}$ from both sides:  $2\\cdot2^{2x} - 20 = 12$\n   *  Add 20 to both sides:  $2\\cdot2^{2x} = 32$\n3. **Simplify:**\n   *  Divide both sides by 2: $2^{2x} = 16$\n4. **Solve for x:**\n   *  Since $16 = 2^4$, we have: $2^{2x} = 2^4$\n   *  Equate the exponents: $2x = 4$\n   *  Divide both sides by 2: $x = 2$\n**Therefore, the solution to the equation is x = 2.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the equation step by step:\n**1. Simplify the equation:**\n* **Expand the left side:**  (2^x - 2)(5 * 2^x + 10) = 10 * (2^x)^2 + 10 * 2^x - 10 * 2^x - 20 = 10 * 2^(2x) - 20\n* **Rewrite the right side:** 3 * 4^x + 12 = 3 * (2^2)^x + 12 = 3 * 2^(2x) + 12\nNow our equation looks like this: \n10 * 2^(2x) - 20 = 3 * 2^(2x) + 12\n**2.

        "Here's how to solve the equation step-by-step:\n1. **Simplify both sides:**\n   * On the left side, factor out a 2 from the second term:  (2^x - 2)(5 * 2^x + 10) = (2^x - 2)(5(2^x + 2))\n   * On the right side, factor out a 12: 3 * 4^x + 12 = 12(1/4 * 4^x + 1)  = 12(4^(x-1) + 1)\n2. **Rewrite with the same base:**\n   * Remember that 4^x = (2^2)^x = 2^(2x).
