Understand Inverse Functions**\nA function is its own inverse if applying the function twice returns the original input. In other words, if  f(f(x)) = x for all x in the domain.\n**2. Apply the Definition to Our Case**\n* **Case 1: x > 3**\n   *  Since f(x) = k(x) for x > 3, we need f(k(x)) = x.\n   *  Since k(x) is also greater than 3, we'll apply the k(x) part of the function to k(x) again:\n      *  f(k(x)) = k(k(x)) = x\n* **Case 2: x \u2264 3**\n   * Since f(x) = x\u00b2 - 6x + 12 for x \u2264 3, we need f(x\u00b2 - 6x + 12) = x.\n   *  Note that x\u00b2 - 6x + 12 \u2264 3 for some values of x. This means we need to consider the possibility that the output of x\u00b2 - 6x + 12 falls within the domain where f(x) = x\u00b2 - 6x + 12.\n**3. Solve for k(x)**\nLet's focus on Case 1, k(k(x)) = x.  To make this easier, let's temporarily replace k(x) with a new variable, say  y:\n* k(y) = x \nTo solve for k(x), we need to find a function k(x) such that when we input k(x) into itself, we get x.  The simplest function that satisfies this is:\n* **k(x) = x** \n**4. Verify for Case 2**\nNow let's verify if k(x) = x works for Case 2.

        "Here's how we can find the function $k(x)$:\n**1. Understanding Inverse Functions**\nA function $f(x)$ is its own inverse if and only if  \\[f(f(x)) = x\\] for all $x$ in the domain of $f$.\n**2. Applying the Definition**\nWe need to consider two cases, based on the definition of $f(x)$:\n* **Case 1:  x > 3**\n   In this case,  $f(x) = k(x)$.  Since $f$ is its own inverse, we have  \\[f(f(x)) = f(k(x)) = x.\\]  Since $k(x) > 3$ (because $x > 3$), we must use the first part of the definition of $f(x)$ again: \\[f(k(x)) = k(k(x)) = x.\\] \n* **Case 2: x \u2264 3** \n   In this case, $f(x) = x^2 - 6x + 12$.  Again,  \\[f(f(x)) = f(x^2 - 6x + 12) = x.\\]  We need to figure out which part of the definition of $f(x)$ to use.  Notice that  \\[x^2 - 6x + 12 = (x-3)^2 + 3.\\] Since $x \\le 3$, we have $(x-3)^2 + 3 \\le 3$, which means we need to use the second part of the definition of $f(x)$:  \\begin{align*}\n   f(x^2 - 6x + 12) &= (x^2 - 6x + 12)^2 - 6(x^2 - 6x + 12) + 12 \\\\\n   &= x.\n   \\end{align*}\n**3. Solving for k(x)**\nWe have two equations to solve for $k(x)$:\n* **From Case 1:**  $k(k(x)) = x$\n* **From Case 2:**  $(x^2 - 6x + 12)^2 - 6(x^2 - 6x + 12) + 12 = x$ \nLet's focus on the second equation.  Expanding and simplifying, we get:\n\\[x^4 - 12x^3 + 54x^2 - 108x + 144 - 6x^2 + 36x - 72 + 12 = x\\]\n\\[x^4 - 12x^3 + 48x^2 - 73x + 84 = 0\\]\nWe can factor this equation as:\n\\[(x-3)(x-4)(x^2 - 5x + 7) = 0\\]\nThe quadratic factor has no real roots. So the solutions to this equation are $x = 3$ and $x = 4$.  However, we know that $x \\le 3$ in this case. Therefore, the solution we are interested in is $x = 3$.\nNow, let's go back to the equation from Case 1:  $k(k(x)) = x$.  Since $x > 3$, we know that $k(x) > 3$.  This means we can substitute $k(x)$ for $x$ in the equation from Case 2:\n\\[k(k(x))^4 - 12k(k(x))^3 + 48k(k(x))^2 - 73k(k(x)) + 84 = 0\\]\nSubstituting $k(k(x)) = x$, we get:\n\\[x^4 - 12x^3 + 48x^2 - 73x + 84 = 0\\]\nThis is the same equation we had before, so we know that $x = 3$ is a solution.  This tells us that $k(x)$ must be a function that takes the value 3 when its input is greater than 3.\n**4. Finding the Explicit Form of k(x)**\nWe know that $k(x)$ is a function that takes the value 3 when its input is greater than 3.  However, we don't have any information about what $k(x)$ does for inputs less than or equal to 3.  \nSince we are looking for a function that is its own inverse, we can exploit the symmetry property of inverse functions.  If a function $f(x)$ is its own inverse, its graph must be symmetric about the line $y = x$.\nConsider the graph of $f(x)$ for $x \\le 3$:\n[Insert a graph of y = x^2 - 6x + 12 for x <= 3 here]\nThe graph of $f(x)$ for $x \\le 3$ is a parabola.  To make the entire graph of $f(x)$ symmetric about the line $y = x$, we need to reflect this parabola across the line $y = x$.  This reflection will create a new part of the graph for $x > 3$, which will be the graph of $k(x)$.\nThe reflection of the parabola $y = x^2 - 6x + 12$ across the line $y = x$ is the parabola $x = y^2 - 6y + 12$.  Solving for $y$, we get:\n\\[y = 3 \\pm \\sqrt{x - 3}\\]\nSince we want $k(x)$ to be defined for $x > 3$, we choose the positive square root:\n\\[k(x) = 3 + \\sqrt{x - 3}\\]\n**5. Final Answer**\nThe function $k(x)$ that makes $f(x)$ its own inverse is:\n\\[k(x) = \n\\begin{cases}\n3 + \\sqrt{x - 3} &\\text{if }x>3, \\\\\nx^2-6x+12&\\text{if }x\\leq3.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]",
        "Here's how we can find the function $k(x)$:\n**1. Understand the Inverse Function Property**\nA function is its own inverse if and only if: \n* **For every input x, the output is the same as the input:**  f(x) = x \n* **The function is one-to-one:**  No two different inputs produce the same output.\n**2. Apply the Inverse Function Property to the Piecewise Function**\nSince we want f(x) to be its own inverse, we need to ensure that f(f(x)) = x for all values of x.  Let's consider the two cases separately:\n* **Case 1: x > 3**\n    *  We know that f(x) = k(x) when x > 3. \n    * To find f(f(x)), we need to find the value of f(k(x)). Since f(x) = k(x) when x > 3, and k(x) will be greater than 3 (because x is greater than 3), we know f(k(x)) = k(k(x)).\n    * Applying the inverse function property, we want k(k(x)) = x for all x > 3.\n* **Case 2: x \u2264 3**\n    *  We know that f(x) = x\u00b2 - 6x + 12 when x \u2264 3. \n    * To find f(f(x)), we need to find the value of f(x\u00b2 - 6x + 12). Since x \u2264 3, the value of x\u00b2 - 6x + 12 will also be less than or equal to 3. \n    *  Therefore, f(x\u00b2 - 6x + 12) = (x\u00b2 - 6x + 12)\u00b2 - 6(x\u00b2 - 6x + 12) + 12.\n    *  Applying the inverse function property, we want (x\u00b2 - 6x + 12)\u00b2 - 6(x\u00b2 - 6x + 12) + 12 = x for all x \u2264 3.\n**3. Solve for k(x)**\n* **Solving for Case 1:**  The equation k(k(x)) = x for all x > 3 doesn't have a simple closed-form solution.  This means we cannot find a single function k(x) that satisfies this equation for all x > 3. \n* **Solving for Case 2:** We have the equation (x\u00b2 - 6x + 12)\u00b2 - 6(x\u00b2 - 6x + 12) + 12 = x for x \u2264 3. This is a polynomial equation.  We can try to solve it, but it's likely to be quite complex. \n**Conclusion**\nDue to the complexity of solving the equations for k(x) in both cases, it's highly unlikely that we can find a function k(x) that makes the entire function f(x) its own inverse. There might be restrictions on the domain of k(x) that would allow for a solution, but without further constraints, finding a suitable k(x) is a challenging task. \n",
        "Here's how to find the function k(x) such that f(x) is its own inverse:\n**Understanding the Problem**\n* **Inverse Functions:** A function f(x) has an inverse, denoted by f\u207b\u00b9(x), if for every input x, f\u207b\u00b9(f(x)) = x and f(f\u207b\u00b9(x)) = x.

This part of the function is a parabola.\n* **For x > 3:**  $f(x) = k(x)$.  We need to find the function $k(x)$ to make the whole function its own inverse.\n**3. Finding the Inverse of the Quadratic Part**\nLet's find the inverse of the quadratic part, $f(x) = x^2 - 6x + 12$ for $x \\leq 3$.\n* **Step 1: Replace f(x) with y:**  $y = x^2 - 6x + 12$\n* **Step 2: Swap x and y:**  $x = y^2 - 6y + 12$\n* **Step 3: Solve for y:** This is a quadratic equation. We can use the quadratic formula to solve for y:\n   ```\n   y = (6 \u00b1 \u221a(36 - 4(1)(12 - x))) / 2\n   y = 3 \u00b1 \u221a(x - 3)\n   ```\n   We need to choose the correct sign. Since the original function is defined for $x \\leq 3$, the inverse should be defined for $y \\leq 3$. Therefore, we choose the minus sign:\n   ```\n   y = 3 - \u221a(x - 3) \n   ```\n* **Step 4: Replace y with f\u207b\u00b9(x):**  $f\u207b\u00b9(x) = 3 - \u221a(x - 3)$ \n**4. Using the Inverse Property**\nNow, let's use the fact that $f$ is its own inverse. Consider the case where $x > 3$.  \n* Since $f$ is its own inverse, if we input $f(x) = k(x)$ into the function, we should get back $x$. In other words:\n    *  $f(k(x)) = x$  for all $x > 3$\n* Since $x > 3$,  the function $k(x)$ will be in the part of the function where $f(x) = k(x)$.  Therefore:\n   ```\n   k(k(x)) = x  for all x > 3 \n   ```\n**5. Finding k(x)**\nWe know that the inverse of the quadratic part of the function is $f\u207b\u00b9(x) = 3 - \u221a(x - 3)$.  Since $f$ is its own inverse, this means that the function $k(x)$ must be the inverse of the quadratic part. \n**Therefore, k(x) = 3 - \u221a(x - 3).** \n**6. Verifying the Solution**\nYou can verify that this function satisfies the condition of being its own inverse by plugging it into the original definition of $f(x)$ and testing the two cases. \n"
