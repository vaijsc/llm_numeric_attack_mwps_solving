    "solution": "One vertex of the triangle is on the vertex of the parabola. The $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $\\frac{-b}{2a}=\\frac{-(-8)}{2(1)}=4$. To find the $y$-coordinate, we plug in $x=4$ to find $y=4^2-8\\cdot 4+5=16-32+5=-11$. So one vertex of the triangle is at $(4, -11)$.\n\nThe other two vertices are on the intersection of the parabola $y=x^2-8x+5$ and the line $y=k$. Thus we have $x^2-8x+5=k$ or $x^2-8x+(5-k)=0$. By the quadratic formula, the solutions to this equation are  \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{-(-8)\\pm\\sqrt{(-8)^2-4(1)(5-k)}}{2(1)}&=\\frac{8\\pm\\sqrt{64-20+4k}}{2}\\\\\n&=4\\pm\\sqrt{11+k}.\n\\end{align*}So the two other vertices of the triangle are $(4-\\sqrt{11+k},k)$ and $(4+\\sqrt{11+k},k)$. Now, we know the triangle is equilateral. Since two vertices are on the same horizontal line, the side length is the difference of their $x$-coordinates, which is $(4+\\sqrt{11+k})-(4-\\sqrt{11+k})=2\\sqrt{11+k}$. The height of the equilateral triangle is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ times the side length, which is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}(2\\sqrt{11+k})=\\sqrt{3(11+k)}$. But the height is also the difference in the $y$-coordinate between the vertex and the horizontal side which is at $y=k$. This means the height is equal to $k-(-11)=k+11$, since $-11$ is the $y$-coordinate of the vertex. These heights must be equal, so we can write the equation \\begin{align*}\n\\sqrt{3(11+k)}&=k+11\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n3(11+k)&=(k+11)^2\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n33+3k&=k^2+22k+121\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n0&=k^2+19k+88\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n0&=(k+8)(k+11).\n\\end{align*}Thus we have $k=-8$ or $k=-11$. We can throw out $k=-11$ because then the line $y=-11$ intersects the parabola only once, at the vertex, so there's no triangle, just a point. Thus we have $k=\\boxed{-8}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step by step:\n**1. Find the vertex of the parabola:**\nThe vertex of the parabola  $y = x^2 - 8x + 5$  can be found by completing the square.  Here's how:\n* **Factor out a -1 from the first two terms:**  \n   $y = -(x^2 + 8x) + 5$\n* **Complete the square inside the parentheses:** Take half of the coefficient of the $x$ term (which is 8), square it (16), and add and subtract it inside the parentheses:\n   $y = -(x^2 + 8x + 16 - 16) + 5$\n* **Rewrite as a squared term:**\n   $y = -(x + 4)^2 + 16 + 5$\n* **Simplify:**\n   $y = -(x + 4)^2 + 21$\nNow the equation is in vertex form: $y = a(x - h)^2 + k$, where the vertex is at $(h, k)$.  Therefore, the vertex of the parabola is at **(-4, 21)**.\n**2. Understand the geometry:**\n* Since one vertex of the equilateral triangle is at the vertex of the parabola, the line of symmetry of the parabola (which is the vertical line $x = -4$) bisects the triangle.\n* The base of the triangle lies on the horizontal line $y = k$.\n**3. Find the distance from the vertex to the base:**\n* The distance between the vertex of the parabola and the line $y = k$ is simply the difference in their y-coordinates:  21 - k. \n* Since the triangle is equilateral, the distance from the vertex to the base is also the height of the triangle.\n**4.  Use the geometry of an equilateral triangle:**\n*  In an equilateral triangle, the height divides the triangle into two 30-60-90 right triangles.\n* The ratio of sides in a 30-60-90 triangle is 1 : \u221a3 : 2.\n* Since the height of the triangle is (21 - k), the base of one of the 30-60-90 triangles is (21 - k) / \u221a3.\n**5. Set up an equation and solve for k:**\n* The base of the equilateral triangle is twice the base of one of the 30-60-90 triangles:  (21 - k) / \u221a3 * 2\n* The base of the equilateral triangle is also the distance between the two points where the parabola intersects the line $y=k$.\n* To find those points, substitute $y=k$ into the parabola's equation and solve for $x$:\n    * $k = x^2 - 8x + 5$\n    * $x^2 - 8x + (5-k) = 0$\n* The difference between the two roots of this quadratic will give you the length of the base. \n* The quadratic formula gives the roots of the equation: \n    * $x = \\frac{8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 4(5-k)}}{2} = 4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 + k}$\n* The difference between the roots is: $4 + \\sqrt{16+k} - (4 - \\sqrt{16+k}) = 2\\sqrt{16+k}$\n* Now we can set up an equation:\n    *  (21 - k) / \u221a3 * 2 = 2\u221a(16 + k)\n* Simplify and solve for k:\n    *  (21 - k) / \u221a3 = \u221a(16 + k)\n    *  (21 - k)^2 / 3 = 16 + k\n    *  441 - 42k + k^2 = 48 + 3k\n    *  k^2 - 45k + 393 = 0\n    *  (k - 21)(k - 18) = 0\nThis gives us two possible solutions: k = 21 and k = 18. However, k = 21 would make the base of the triangle have zero length, which is not possible.\n**Therefore, the value of k is 18.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the vertex of the parabola:**\n* The parabola is in the form  y = ax\u00b2 + bx + c.\n* The x-coordinate of the vertex is given by  x = -b / 2a. \n* In this case, a = 1, b = -8.  Therefore, x = -(-8) / (2 * 1) = 4.\n* Substitute x = 4 into the equation to find the y-coordinate: y = 4\u00b2 - 8(4) + 5 = -11.\n* So, the vertex of the parabola is (4, -11).\n**2. Visualize the situation:**\n* Imagine an equilateral triangle with one vertex at (4, -11) and its base parallel to the x-axis.\n* The line y = k represents the base of this triangle.\n**3. Understand the properties of an equilateral triangle:**\n* All sides are equal in length.\n* Each angle measures 60 degrees.\n**4. Use the symmetry:**\n* Since the triangle is equilateral, the line of symmetry (which passes through the vertex (4, -11) and the midpoint of the base) will bisect the base and form a 30-60-90 right triangle.\n**5. Apply trigonometry:**\n* In a 30-60-90 triangle, the ratio of the sides is 1:\u221a3:2.\n* The distance from the vertex (4, -11) to the midpoint of the base is the longer leg of the 30-60-90 triangle.\n* The distance from the vertex to the line y = k is the shorter leg.\n**6. Calculate the distances:**\n* The distance from the vertex to the line y = k is  -11 - k.\n* The distance from the vertex to the midpoint of the base is \u221a3 times the distance to the line y = k, which is \u221a3 (-11 - k).\n**7. Set up an equation:**\n* The distance from the vertex to the midpoint of the base is also half the length of the base.\n* The length of the base is the distance between the x-intercepts of the parabola.\n**8. Find the x-intercepts:**\n* To find the x-intercepts, set y = 0 in the equation of the parabola: 0 = x\u00b2 - 8x + 5.\n* Solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula: x = [8 \u00b1 \u221a(64 - 20)] / 2 = 4 \u00b1 \u221a11.\n* The distance between the x-intercepts is (4 + \u221a11) - (4 - \u221a11) = 2\u221a11.\n**9. Solve for k:**\n*  We have: \u221a3 (-11 - k) = (1/2) * 2\u221a11 \n* Simplify: -11\u221a3 - k\u221a3 = \u221a11\n* Solve for k: k = -11\u221a3 - \u221a11 / \u221a3 = -11 - \u221a33 / 3\n**Therefore, the value of k is  -11 - \u221a33 / 3** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the Vertex of the Parabola**\nThe vertex of the parabola  $y = x^2 - 8x + 5$ can be found by completing the square:\n* **Rewrite:**  $y = (x^2 - 8x) + 5$\n* **Complete the square:** Take half of the coefficient of the $x$ term (-8), square it (16), and add and subtract it inside the parentheses: \n   $y = (x^2 - 8x + 16 - 16) + 5$\n* **Factor and simplify:** $y = (x - 4)^2 - 11$\nNow the equation is in vertex form: $y = a(x - h)^2 + k$, where $(h, k)$ is the vertex.  Therefore, the vertex of the parabola is **(4, -11)**.\n**2. Visualize the Situation**\nImagine the parabola opening upwards. Since one vertex of the equilateral triangle is at the vertex of the parabola, the other two vertices must lie symmetrically on the parabola, above the line of symmetry of the parabola (which is the vertical line x = 4). The side of the triangle opposite the vertex on the parabola lies on the line y = k.\n**3.  Key Geometric Insight**\nSince the triangle is equilateral, the line y = k must be parallel to the base of the triangle (the line connecting the other two vertices). This means the distance from the vertex of the parabola to the line y = k is equal to the height of the equilateral triangle.\n**4. Calculate the Height**\nLet's consider an equilateral triangle with side length 's'.  Drop a perpendicular from one vertex to the opposite side, dividing the equilateral triangle into two congruent 30-60-90 right triangles. \n* The hypotenuse of each right triangle is 's'.\n* The shorter leg is s/2 (half the side length).\n* The longer leg is the height of the equilateral triangle, which can be found using the Pythagorean theorem or the 30-60-90 triangle ratios.  The height is  (s\u221a3)/2.\n**5.  Relate the Height to the y-coordinate**\nSince the vertex of the parabola is at (4, -11) and the line y = k is parallel to the base of the triangle, the distance from the vertex to the line y = k is simply the difference in their y-coordinates: k - (-11) = k + 11.\n**6.  Set up the Equation and Solve**\nWe know the height of the equilateral triangle is (s\u221a3)/2, and we know this height is equal to k + 11.  We need to find a way to relate the side length 's' to the parabola.\n* Notice that the horizontal distance between the vertex of the parabola and either of the other two vertices of the equilateral triangle is half the base of the triangle (s/2).  \n* Since these points lie on the parabola, we can find the y-coordinate of one of these vertices using the equation of the parabola. Let the x-coordinate of this vertex be 4 + s/2.  Then its y-coordinate is:\n   y = (4 + s/2)^2 - 8(4 + s/2) + 5\n* We also know the y-coordinate of this vertex is k (since it lies on the line y = k).  \n* Set the two expressions for the y-coordinate equal to each other and solve for 's'.  You'll get a value for 's' in terms of k.\n**7.  Solve for k**\nFinally, substitute the expression for 's' in terms of k into the equation (s\u221a3)/2 = k + 11.  Solve this equation for k.\n**Note:** The algebra involved in the last steps might be a bit tedious, but the solution process is straightforward. The key is to visualize the problem, use the properties of equilateral triangles and 30-60-90 triangles, and carefully relate the geometry to the equation of the parabola. \n",
        "Here's a step-by-step solution:\n**1. Find the vertex of the parabola:**\nThe parabola is given by the equation  *y = x\u00b2 - 8x + 5*. To find the vertex, we can use the formula *x = -b/2a*, where *a* and *b* are the coefficients of the quadratic equation. In this case, *a = 1* and *b = -8*.\n*x = -(-8) / (2 * 1) = 4*\nNow, substitute *x = 4* back into the equation to find the y-coordinate of the vertex:\n*y = 4\u00b2 - 8(4) + 5 = -11*\nTherefore, the vertex of the parabola is at the point *(4, -11)*.\n**2. Visualize the situation:**\nImagine an equilateral triangle with one vertex at (4, -11), and the opposite side lying along the line *y = k*.  Since the triangle is equilateral, the other two vertices must be equidistant from (4, -11).  Also, the line *y = k* must be parallel to the x-axis and pass through the midpoint of the base of the triangle.\n**3.  Use symmetry:**\nBecause the triangle is equilateral, the x-coordinates of the other two vertices must be symmetrically placed around *x = 4*.  Let the x-coordinate of one of these vertices be *x = 4 + d*, then the x-coordinate of the other vertex would be *x = 4 - d*.\n**4.  Use the parabola equation:**\nSince these two vertices lie on the parabola, their y-coordinates must satisfy the equation *y = x\u00b2 - 8x + 5*.  Let's substitute the x-coordinates of these vertices into the equation:\n*y = (4 + d)\u00b2 - 8(4 + d) + 5* \n*y = (4 - d)\u00b2 - 8(4 - d) + 5*\n**5.  Equate the y-coordinates:**\nSince the line *y = k* passes through the midpoint of the base of the triangle, the y-coordinates of the two vertices must be equal to *k*.  Therefore, we can set the two expressions for *y* equal to each other:\n*(4 + d)\u00b2 - 8(4 + d) + 5 = (4 - d)\u00b2 - 8(4 - d) + 5*\n**6.  Solve for d:**\nSimplifying the equation:\n*16 + 8d + d\u00b2 - 32 - 8d + 5 = 16 - 8d + d\u00b2 - 32 + 8d + 5*\n*d\u00b2 - 11 = d\u00b2 - 11*\nThis equation is always true, which means there's no unique solution for *d*.  This is expected since we haven't used the fact that the triangle is equilateral yet.\n**7.  Use the equilateral triangle property:**\nThe side length of the equilateral triangle is equal to the distance between the vertex at (4, -11) and one of the other vertices. Let's use the vertex at (4 + d, k).\nThe distance formula gives us:\n*\u221a[(4 + d - 4)\u00b2 + (k - (-11))\u00b2] = \u221a[d\u00b2 + (k + 11)\u00b2]*\nThis distance is also equal to twice the distance between the midpoint of the base and the vertex at (4, -11). Since the midpoint of the base lies on the line *y = k*, this distance is simply:\n*\u221a[(4 - 4)\u00b2 + (k - (-11))\u00b2] = \u221a[(k + 11)\u00b2]*\n**8.  Set the distances equal:**\nNow we can equate the two distances:\n*\u221a[d\u00b2 + (k + 11)\u00b2] = \u221a[(k + 11)\u00b2]*\nSquaring both sides:\n*d\u00b2 + (k + 11)\u00b2 = (k + 11)\u00b2*\n*d\u00b2 = 0*\n*d = 0*\n**9.  Find the value of k:**\nSince *d = 0*, the other two vertices of the triangle are also at *x = 4*. This means the base of the triangle lies on the vertical line *x = 4*.  Since the line *y = k* passes through the midpoint of the base, the value of *k* must be equal to the y-coordinate of the vertex at (4, -11).\nTherefore, *k = -11*.\n**Answer:** The value of *k* is **-11**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the vertex of the parabola:**\n* The vertex of the parabola  $y=x^2-8x+5$ occurs at the point where the derivative is zero. \n* The derivative is $y' = 2x-8$. Setting this equal to zero gives us $x=4$.\n* Substitute $x=4$ back into the equation of the parabola to find the y-coordinate: $y = 4^2 - 8(4) + 5 = -11$.\n* Therefore, the vertex of the parabola is at $(4,-11)$.\n**2. Visualize the situation:**\n* Imagine the equilateral triangle with its vertex at $(4,-11)$.  The side opposite this vertex lies on the line $y=k$.\n* Since the triangle is equilateral, the line $y=k$ must be parallel to the tangent line of the parabola at the point $(4,-11)$.\n**3. Find the equation of the tangent line:**\n* The slope of the tangent line at the point $(4,-11)$ is the value of the derivative at that point:  $y'(4) = 2(4) - 8 = 0$.\n* Since the tangent line has a slope of 0, it's a horizontal line.\n* The equation of the tangent line is simply $y = -11$.\n**4. Determine the value of k:**\n* The line $y=k$ is parallel to the tangent line $y=-11$.  Parallel lines have the same slope.\n* Therefore, $k = \\boxed{-11}$. \n"
