        "Here's how to find the sum of the 10 smallest positive multiples of three:\n**1. Identify the multiples:**\n* The smallest positive multiple of 3 is 3 (3 x 1).\n* The next smallest is 6 (3 x 2), then 9 (3 x 3), and so on.\n**2.  List the first 10 multiples:**\n* 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30\n**3. Calculate the sum:**\n* You can add these numbers directly, or use a formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.  Here's the formula:\n    * **Sum = (n/2) * (first term + last term)** \n    * Where 'n' is the number of terms\n* In our case:\n    * n = 10\n    * First term = 3\n    * Last term = 30\n* Sum = (10/2) * (3 + 30) = 5 * 33 = **165**\n**Therefore, the sum of the 10 smallest positive multiples of three is 165.** \n",
