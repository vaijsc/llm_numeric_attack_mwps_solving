If $2n + 499 = 699$, then $n = 100$, so the number of terms in this sequence is 100.\n\nThe sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, so the sum is $(501 + 699)/2 \\cdot 100 = \\boxed{60000}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Identify the first and last odd integers:**\n* The first odd integer greater than 500 is 501.\n* The last odd integer less than 700 is 699.\n**2. Arithmetic Series:**\n* Notice that the odd integers between 501 and 699 form an arithmetic series: 501, 503, 505, ... , 697, 699.\n* The common difference between consecutive terms is 2.\n**3. Formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:**\nThe sum (S) of an arithmetic series is:\nS = (n/2) * (a + l)\nwhere:\n* n = number of terms\n* a = first term\n* l = last term\n**4. Find the number of terms (n):**\n*  We need to find how many odd numbers are there between 501 and 699.  Think of it like this:  we're counting by twos from 501 to 699.\n* Divide the difference between the last and first term by the common difference, and add 1: \n    * (699 - 501) / 2 + 1 = 198 / 2 + 1 = 100 \n**5. Calculate the sum:**\n* S = (100/2) * (501 + 699)\n* S = 50 * 1200\n* S = 60,000\n**Therefore, the sum of all odd integers between 500 and 700 is 60,000.** \n",
