        "Let's break down the computation step-by-step:\n1. **Start with the innermost function:**  We begin by finding  $f(512)$. Since 512 is greater than or equal to 0, we use the first part of the definition of $f(x)$: \n   \n   $f(512) = -\\sqrt[3]{512} = -8$\n2. **Work our way outwards:** Now we need to find $f(f(512))$, which is the same as $f(-8)$. Since -8 is less than 0, we use the second part of the definition of $f(x)$:\n   $f(-8) = (-8)^2 = 64$\n3. **Continue the process:** Next, we find $f(f(f(512)))$, which is $f(64)$. Since 64 is greater than or equal to 0, we use the first part of the definition:\n   $f(64) = -\\sqrt[3]{64} = -4$\n4. **Final step:** Finally, we find $f(f(f(f(512))))$, which is $f(-4)$. Since -4 is less than 0, we use the second part of the definition:\n   $f(-4) = (-4)^2 = 16$\nTherefore, $f(f(f(f(512)))) = \\boxed{16}$. \n",
