        "Here's how to solve the equation step-by-step:\n1. **Rewrite 32 as a power of 2:**  We know that 32 is equal to 2 to the power of 5 (2^5 = 32).\n2. **Substitute:** Now we can rewrite the equation:  2^(x+2) = 2^5\n3. **Equate the exponents:**  Since the bases are the same, we can equate the exponents: x + 2 = 5\n4. **Solve for x:** Subtract 2 from both sides to get x = 3\n**Therefore, the integer x that satisfies the equation is x = 3.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the equation step-by-step:\n1. **Express 32 as a power of 2:**  We know that  32 is equal to 2 multiplied by itself five times (2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2), or 2\u2075.\n2. **Rewrite the equation:** Now our equation becomes: 2^(x+2) = 2\u2075\n3. **Equate the exponents:** Since the bases are the same, we can equate the exponents: x + 2 = 5\n4. **Solve for x:** Subtract 2 from both sides to get x = 3.\n**Therefore, the integer x that satisfies the equation is 3.** \n",
