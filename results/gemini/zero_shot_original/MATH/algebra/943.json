    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We know that $\\frac{A+B+C}{3} = 10$, thus, $A+B+C = 30$.  We also know that $B = C - 3$, and that $A = B - 6 = C - 9$.  Thus, $(C - 9) + (C - 3) + C = 30$, thus, $3C = 42 \\rightarrow C = \\boxed{14}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Set up equations based on the given information:**\n* **Arithmetic Mean:** (A + B + C) / 3 = 10 \n* **Relationship between A and B:** A = B - 6\n* **Relationship between C and B:** C = B + 3\n**2. Substitute the values of A and C into the arithmetic mean equation:**\n* [(B - 6) + B + (B + 3)] / 3 = 10\n**3. Simplify the equation:**\n* (3B - 3) / 3 = 10\n* B - 1 = 10\n**4.
