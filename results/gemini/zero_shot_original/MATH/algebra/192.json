        "Here's how to solve this step-by-step:\n1. **Calculate the inner part:**  We need to find the value of  $(3 \\Psi 1)$.  Using the definition of the relation, we get:\n   \n   $3 \\Psi 1 = 2(3) + 5(1) = 6 + 5 = 11$\n2. **Substitute and calculate the outer part:** Now we know that $(3 \\Psi 1) = 11$. Substitute this back into the original expression:\n   $9 \\Psi (3 \\Psi 1) = 9 \\Psi 11$\n3. **Final Calculation:**  Apply the relation again:\n   $9 \\Psi 11 = 2(9) + 5(11) = 18 + 55 = \\boxed{73}$ \n",
