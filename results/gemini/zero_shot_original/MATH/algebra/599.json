    "solution": "We have $p(2)=3$, but we have no information about how $p(x)$ acts when we put numbers like $2$ into it. We can only put outputs of $q(x)$ into $p(x)$. So, let's force $2$ to be an output of $q(x)$: Let $q(a)=2$ for some $a$.  Then we know $p(q(a))=4a+7$. But since $q(a)=2$, we really have $p(2)=4a+7$. But we're given that $p(2)=3$, so $3=4a+7$. Solving this gives $a=-1$ (so as it turns out, there was a value of $a$ for which $q(a)=2$.) By the definition of $a$, $q(a)=2$, so since $a=-1$, $q(-1)=2$. But that's exactly what we wanted to find! So $q(-1)=\\boxed{2}$.",

This tells us that when the input to the function *p(x)* is 2, the output is 3.\n*  We know *p(q(x)) = 4x + 7* for all *x*.

Use the second equation to find a relationship between *q(x)* and *x*:**\n*  Since *p(q(x)) = 4x + 7*, and we know *p(2) = 3*, we can deduce that *q(x)* must equal 2 when *4x + 7 = 3*. \n**3.

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Information**\n* **Linear Functions:**  We're dealing with functions of the form  `y = mx + b`, where 'm' is the slope and 'b' is the y-intercept.\n* **p(2) = 3:** This means when we input 2 into the function `p(x)`, we get an output of 3.\n* **p(q(x)) = 4x + 7:** This is a composite function. It means we first find the output of `q(x)`, then use that output as the input for `p(x)`. The result is `4x + 7`.\n**2. Find q(x)**\nLet's substitute a specific value into the equation `p(q(x)) = 4x + 7` to gain some insight.  We know `p(2) = 3`.  Let's see if we can make the argument of `p` in `p(q(x))` equal to 2. \n* **Setting up the equation:** If we want `p(q(x)) = p(2)`, then `q(x)` must equal 2.  Let's find the value of `x` that makes this true. \n* **Solving for x:**  Let's set `q(x) = 2`. Since `q(x)` is linear, it can be written as `q(x) = mx + b`. We need to find the values of `m` and `b` such that `q(x) = 2` for some value of `x`. \n* **Using the Composite Function:**  Let's go back to the equation `p(q(x)) = 4x + 7`.  We know that `p(2) = 3`, so we can rewrite the equation as: `p(q(x)) = p(2) = 4x + 7`. \n* **Matching Outputs:**  For the outputs to be equal, the inputs must also be equal.  Therefore, `q(x) = 2`  must be true when `4x + 7 = 3`.\n* **Solve for x:**  `4x + 7 = 3` gives us `x = -1`.\nWe've now found that `q(-1) = 2`.\n**3. Finding q(-1)**\nWe already found that `q(-1) = 2`.\n**Therefore, q(-1) = 2** \n",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\n* We have two linear functions,  *p(x)* and *q(x)*.\n* We know *p(2) = 3*, meaning when we input 2 into the function *p*, we get 3 as the output.\n* We also know *p(q(x)) = 4x + 7* for all *x*. This means that if we plug *q(x)* into the function *p*, the result is *4x + 7*.\n**2. Finding the Expression for *q(x)***\nLet's use the fact that *p(q(x)) = 4x + 7*.  Since *p(x)* is a linear function, it can be written in the form *p(x) = mx + b* (where *m* is the slope and *b* is the y-intercept).  \n* We know *p(2) = 3*, so let's substitute that into the equation:  *3 = 2m + b*.\n* Now, let's think about what *p(q(x)) = 4x + 7* tells us.  Since *q(x)* is the input to the function *p*, we can replace *x* in the equation *p(x) = mx + b* with *q(x)*:\n  *  *p(q(x)) = m(q(x)) + b*\n* We know *p(q(x)) = 4x + 7*, so we can set the two expressions equal to each other:\n  *  *4x + 7 = m(q(x)) + b*\n* Now, we have two equations with two unknowns (*m* and *b*). We can solve for them:\n  * Equation 1:  *3 = 2m + b*\n  * Equation 2:  *4x + 7 = m(q(x)) + b*\nTo eliminate *b*, subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:\n  *  *4x + 4 = m(q(x)) - 2m*\n  *  *4x + 4 = m(q(x) - 2)*\nNow, let's look at the right side of the equation: *m(q(x) - 2)*.  We know that *p(q(x)) = 4x + 7*, and we've already established that *p(x) = mx + b*.  Therefore, the right side of the equation must also represent the function *p(x)*.  This means that:\n  * *q(x) - 2 = x* \n  Solving for *q(x)*, we get:\n  * *q(x) = x + 2*\n**3. Finding *q(-1)***\nNow that we have the expression for *q(x)*, we can easily find *q(-1)*:\n* *q(-1) = -1 + 2 = 1*\n**Answer:**  *q(-1) = 1* \n"
