        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Factor the quadratic expression:**\n* We need to find two numbers that multiply to give 42 (2 * 21) and add up to 13. \n* The numbers 6 and 7 satisfy these conditions.\n**2. Rewrite the expression:**\n* We can rewrite the expression as:  \n   2z\u00b2 + 13z + 21 = 2z\u00b2 + 6z + 7z + 21\n**3. Factor by grouping:**\n* Group the terms: (2z\u00b2 + 6z) + (7z + 21)\n* Factor out common factors: 2z(z + 3) + 7(z + 3)\n* Factor out (z + 3): (z + 3)(2z + 7)\n**4. Identify a and b:**\n* We have the factored form: (z + 3)(2z + 7).  Therefore, a = 3 and b = 7.\n**5. Calculate 2a + b:**\n* 2a + b = 2(3) + 7 = 6 + 7 = **13** \n**Therefore, 2a + b = 13.** \n",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand Factoring**\nWe need to find two binomials (expressions with two terms) that multiply to give us the original quadratic expression. The form we're looking for is:\n(z + a)(2z + b)\n**2.  Focus on the Constant Term**\nThe constant term in our original expression is 21.  This is the product of the constant terms in our binomials, 'a' and 'b'.\n* Find the factors of 21: 1, 3, 7, and 21.\n**3. Focus on the Coefficient of the z Term**\nThe coefficient of the z term in our original expression is 13. This comes from the sum of the products of the inner and outer terms of the binomials:\n*  2az + bz = 13z\n**4. Test the Factors**\nWe need to find combinations of 'a' and 'b' from the factors of 21 that satisfy the above condition. Let's try a few:\n* **If a = 3 and b = 7:**\n   * 2az + bz = 2(3)z + 7z = 6z + 7z = 13z  (This works!)\n**5.  Check the Entire Expression**\nLet's verify that our factorization is correct:\n* (z + 3)(2z + 7) = 2z\u00b2 + 7z + 6z + 21 = 2z\u00b2 + 13z + 21  (It's correct!)\n**6. Calculate 2a + b**\nNow, let's find 2a + b:\n* 2a + b = 2(3) + 7 = 6 + 7 = **13**\n**Therefore, 2a + b = 13.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Problem:**\nWe need to find the values of  'a' and 'b' that make the factored expression  (z + a)(2z + b) equal to the given expression 2z\u00b2 + 13z + 21.\n**2. Use FOIL:**\nFOIL (First, Outer, Inner, Last) is a method for expanding a product of two binomials:\n* **First:** (z)(2z) = 2z\u00b2\n* **Outer:** (z)(b) = bz\n* **Inner:** (a)(2z) = 2az\n* **Last:** (a)(b) = ab\nCombining these terms gives us: 2z\u00b2 + bz + 2az + ab\n**3. Match Coefficients:**\nNow we need to match the coefficients of our expanded expression with the original expression:\n* 2z\u00b2 = 2z\u00b2  (This is already matched)\n* bz + 2az = 13z\n* ab = 21\n**4. Solve for 'a' and 'b':**\n* From the equation bz + 2az = 13z, we can factor out 'z': z(b + 2a) = 13z.  Therefore, b + 2a = 13.\n* From the equation ab = 21, we need to find pairs of factors of 21. The pairs are (1, 21), (3, 7), (-1, -21), and (-3, -7).\n**5. Check the Pairs:**\nLet's check each pair of factors to see if they satisfy the equation b + 2a = 13:\n* (1, 21):  1 + 2(21) = 43 (doesn't work)\n* (3, 7):  7 + 2(3) = 13 (works!)\n* (-1, -21):  -21 + 2(-1) = -23 (doesn't work)\n* (-3, -7):  -7 + 2(-3) = -13 (doesn't work)\n**6. Find 2a + b:**\nWe found that a = 3 and b = 7.  Therefore, 2a + b = 2(3) + 7 = **13**. \n"
