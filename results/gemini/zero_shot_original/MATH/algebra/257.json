    "solution": "The points of intersection of the line $y = 7$ and $y = 2x^2 + 8x + 4$, by substitution, are found when $2x^2 + 8x + 4 = 7 \\Longrightarrow 2x^2 + 8x - 3 = 0$.

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the points of intersection**\nSince the side of the square lies on the line y = 7, we need to find where this line intersects the parabola.  Substitute y = 7 into the equation of the parabola:\n  7 = 2x\u00b2 + 8x + 4\n**2. Solve the quadratic equation**\nSubtract 7 from both sides to get:\n  0 = 2x\u00b2 + 8x - 3\nNow we need to solve this quadratic equation. We can use the quadratic formula:\n  x = [-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)] / 2a\nWhere a = 2, b = 8, and c = -3.  Plugging in these values:\n  x = [-8 \u00b1 \u221a(8\u00b2 - 4 * 2 * -3)] / (2 * 2)\n  x = [-8 \u00b1 \u221a(88)] / 4\n  x = [-8 \u00b1 2\u221a22] / 4\n  x = -2 \u00b1 (1/2)\u221a22\nThis gives us two x-values where the line intersects the parabola.\n**3. Calculate the side length of the square**\nThe difference between the two x-values we just found represents the side length of the square.  Let's call these values x1 and x2:\n  x1 = -2 + (1/2)\u221a22\n  x2 = -2 - (1/2)\u221a22\nThe side length is:\n  x2 - x1 = (-2 - (1/2)\u221a22) - (-2 + (1/2)\u221a22) = -\u221a22 \nSince side length cannot be negative, we take the absolute value:\n  Side length = \u221a22\n**4. Calculate the area of the square**\nThe area of a square is side length squared:\n  Area = (\u221a22)\u00b2 = **22** \n**Therefore, the area of the square is 22 square units.** \n",
