    "solution": "By considering the expression $\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$ for the solutions of $ax^2+bx+c=0$, we find that the solutions are rational if and only if the discriminant $b^2-4ac$ has a rational square root. Therefore, the solutions of $kx^2+10x+k=0$ are rational if and only if $100-4(k)(k)$ is a perfect square. (Recall that if $n$ is an integer which is not a perfect square, then $\\sqrt{n}$ is irrational).  By writing the discriminant as $4(25-k^2)$, we see that we only need to check the integers $1\\leq k\\leq 5$.  Of these, 3, 4, and 5 work, for a total of $\\boxed{3}$ integer values of $k$.",

        "Here's a step-by-step solution:\n**1. Understand Rational Solutions and the Discriminant**\n* A quadratic equation has rational solutions if and only if its discriminant is a perfect square.\n* The discriminant of the quadratic $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is given by $b^2 - 4ac$.\n**2. Apply to Our Equation**\n* In our equation, $kx^2 + 10x + k = 0$, we have  $a = k$, $b = 10$, and $c = k$.\n* The discriminant is therefore $10^2 - 4(k)(k) = 100 - 4k^2$.\n**3. Find the Values of k**\n* We want to find the values of $k$ for which $100 - 4k^2$ is a perfect square. \n* Let's factor out a 4:  $100 - 4k^2 = 4(25 - k^2) = 4(5 + k)(5 - k)$.\n* For this to be a perfect square, both $(5 + k)$ and $(5 - k)$ must be perfect squares (since 4 is already a perfect square).\n**4. Analyze the Factors**\n* Since $5 + k$ and $5 - k$ differ by $2k$, they must be either both odd or both even.\n* The only way they can both be perfect squares and differ by an even number is if they are both even squares.\n* The even squares less than 25 (since 5 + k and 5 - k must add up to 10) are 4 and 16.\n**5. Solve for k**\n* If $5 + k = 4$, then $k = -1$. \n* If $5 + k = 16$, then $k = 11$.\n* If $5 - k = 4$, then $k = 1$.\n* If $5 - k = 16$, then $k = -11$.\n**6. The Answer**\n* Since we only want positive integer values of $k$, the solutions are $k = 1$ and $k = 11$. \n**Therefore, there are **two** positive integer values of $k$ for which the equation $kx^2 + 10x + k = 0$ has rational solutions.** \n",

Understand Rational Solutions and the Discriminant**\n* **Rational Solutions:** A quadratic equation has rational solutions if and only if its discriminant is a perfect square.\n* **Discriminant:** The discriminant of the quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is given by  $b^2 - 4ac$.\n**2. Apply to the Given Equation**\n* In our equation, $kx^2 + 10x + k = 0$, we have:\n    *  $a = k$\n    *  $b = 10$\n    *  $c = k$\n* The discriminant is:  $10^2 - 4(k)(k) = 100 - 4k^2$\n**3. Find Values of k for Perfect Square Discriminants**\n* We need to find values of $k$ for which $100 - 4k^2$ is a perfect square. Let's factor out a 4: \n    * $100 - 4k^2 = 4(25 - k^2) = 4(5 + k)(5 - k)$\n* For this expression to be a perfect square, both $(5 + k)$ and $(5 - k)$ must be perfect squares (or both be multiples of the same perfect square). \n**4. Analyze the Factors**\n* **Case 1: Both Factors are Perfect Squares**\n    * The only way this can happen is if both $(5 + k)$ and $(5 - k)$ are equal to 1.  This is impossible since $k$ cannot be both 4 and -4.\n* **Case 2: Both Factors are Multiples of the Same Perfect Square**\n    * Let's say $(5 + k) = m^2$ and $(5 - k) = n^2$ where $m$ and $n$ are integers.  \n    * Subtracting these equations gives us: \n        * $(5 + k) - (5 - k) = m^2 - n^2$\n        * $2k = m^2 - n^2 = (m + n)(m - n)$\n    * This means that $2k$ must be the product of two integers. \n**5. Find Possible Values of k**\n* Since $2k$ is even,  $m + n$ and $m - n$ must both be even or both be odd.\n* We need to consider factors of $2k$ that satisfy this condition and find corresponding values of $k$.\n* Some possibilities include:\n    * $2k = 2 \\cdot 12$,  leading to $k = 6$\n    * $2k = 4 \\cdot 6$,  leading to $k = 12$\n    * $2k = 6 \\cdot 4$,  leading to $k = 12$ \n    * $2k = 8 \\cdot 3$, leading to $k = 12$\n    * $2k = 10 \\cdot 2$, leading to $k = 10$\n**6. Check for Validity**\n* Remember that we need to check if these values of $k$ actually result in a perfect square discriminant.\n* We find that $k = 6$ and $k = 10$ are the only values that work.\n**Answer:**\nThere are **two** positive integer values of $k$ for which the equation has rational solutions. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Recall the Discriminant**\nA quadratic equation of the form  *ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0* has rational solutions if and only if its discriminant,  *b\u00b2 - 4ac*, is a perfect square.\n**2. Apply the Discriminant to Our Equation**\nIn our case,  *a = k*, *b = 10*, and *c = k*.  Therefore, the discriminant is:\n*10\u00b2 - 4(k)(k) = 100 - 4k\u00b2*\n**3. Find Perfect Squares**\nWe want to find values of *k* that make *100 - 4k\u00b2* a perfect square.  Let's factor out a 4:\n*4(25 - k\u00b2) = 4(5\u00b2 - k\u00b2)*\nNow we can see that this expression is a perfect square if and only if *5\u00b2 - k\u00b2* is a difference of squares, which factors as *(5 + k)(5 - k)*.  \n**4. Consider the Factors**\nTo make *(5 + k)(5 - k)* a perfect square, we need both factors to be perfect squares (or one factor is 1 and the other is the perfect square). Let's consider the possibilities:\n* **Both factors are perfect squares:**  This means *5 + k* and *5 - k* are both perfect squares.  The only way this can happen is if both factors are 1 or both factors are 9 (since the difference between them is 10).  If they are both 1, then *k = 0*. If they are both 9, then *k = 4*. \n* **One factor is 1 and the other is a perfect square:**  This means either *5 + k = 1* (so *k = -4*) or *5 - k = 1* (so *k = 4*). \n**5.

Find the Values of k that Make the Discriminant a Perfect Square**\nWe need to find the positive integer values of *k* that make 100 - 4k\u00b2 a perfect square.  Let's manipulate the expression:\n* 100 - 4k\u00b2 = 4(25 - k\u00b2) = 4(5\u00b2 - k\u00b2)\nNow, we can see that for 100 - 4k\u00b2 to be a perfect square, (5\u00b2 - k\u00b2) must also be a perfect square.  This means that *k* must be less than 5.\n**4. Test Possible Values of k**\nLet's check the possible values of *k* from 1 to 4:\n* **k = 1:** 100 - 4(1\u00b2) = 96 (not a perfect square)\n* **k = 2:** 100 - 4(2\u00b2) = 84 (not a perfect square)\n* **k = 3:** 100 - 4(3\u00b2) = 64 (a perfect square)\n* **k = 4:** 100 - 4(4\u00b2) = 36 (a perfect square)\n**5.

The discriminant of the quadratic $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is given by $b^2 - 4ac$.\n**2. Apply to Our Problem**\nIn our case, the discriminant is $10^2 - 4(k)(k) = 100 - 4k^2$.  We want to find the values of $k$ for which this expression is a perfect square.\n**3. Factor and Analyze**\nLet's factor the discriminant:\n* $100 - 4k^2 = 4(25 - k^2) = 4(5+k)(5-k)$\nFor this expression to be a perfect square, each factor must appear an even number of times.  Since we are looking for positive integer values of $k$, we need to consider:\n* **Case 1:**  Both $(5+k)$ and $(5-k)$ are perfect squares.\n* **Case 2:**  Either $(5+k)$ or $(5-k)$ is a perfect square, and the other is 4 times a perfect square.\n**4. Solve the Cases**\n* **Case 1:** If both $(5+k)$ and $(5-k)$ are perfect squares, then their difference, $(5+k)-(5-k) = 2k$, must also be a perfect square.  The only even perfect squares less than 10 (since $k$ is positive) are 0 and 4.  These lead to $k = 0$ and $k = 2$, respectively.  However, we need positive values of $k$, so $k = 2$ is the only solution from this case.\n* **Case 2:**  We'll analyze the case where $(5+k)$ is a perfect square (the other case is similar). Let $(5+k) = n^2$ where $n$ is an integer.  Then $(5-k) = 4m^2$ for some integer $m$.  Subtracting these equations, we get $2k = n^2 - 4m^2 = (n+2m)(n-2m)$. Since $n$ and $m$ are integers, this means $2k$ must be the product of two integers.  The only even perfect squares less than 10 are 0 and 4.  These lead to $k = 0$ and $k = 2$, respectively.  Again, we discard $k = 0$ and keep $k = 2$.\n**5. The Answer**\nWe found that the only positive integer value of $k$ that makes the discriminant a perfect square is $k = \\boxed{2}$. \n"
