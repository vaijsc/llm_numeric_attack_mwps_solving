        "### Step 1: Set up the equations\nTo find the points of intersection, we need to find the values of *x* and *y* that satisfy both equations. So, we set the equations equal to each other:\n  x\u00b2 + a = ax\n### Step 2: Rearrange the equation\nLet's rearrange the equation to get a quadratic equation:\n  x\u00b2 - ax + a = 0\n### Step 3: Analyze the discriminant\nFor the graphs to intersect **exactly once**, the quadratic equation must have exactly one solution.  This means the discriminant of the quadratic equation must be equal to zero.  The discriminant is the part under the square root in the quadratic formula:\n  b\u00b2 - 4ac = 0\nIn our equation, a = 1, b = -a, and c = a.  Substituting these values into the discriminant equation, we get:\n  (-a)\u00b2 - 4(1)(a) = 0\n### Step 4: Solve for 'a'\nSimplifying the equation:\n  a\u00b2 - 4a = 0\nFactoring out an 'a':\n  a(a - 4) = 0\nThis gives us two possible solutions:\n  a = 0  or  a = 4\n### Step 5: Find the sum\nFinally, we find the sum of the possible values of 'a':\n  0 + 4 = **4** \nTherefore, the sum of all numbers *a* for which the graphs intersect one time is **4**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Set up the equation:**\nThe graphs intersect when their y-values are equal. So, we set the equations equal to each other:\n  x\u00b2 + a = ax\n**2. Rearrange the equation:**\nBring all terms to one side:\n  x\u00b2 + (a - a)x - a = 0\n  x\u00b2 - ax - a = 0\n**3. Analyze the discriminant:**\nFor the graphs to intersect exactly once, the quadratic equation must have exactly one solution. This means the discriminant of the quadratic formula must be equal to zero.\nThe discriminant is: b\u00b2 - 4ac  \nIn our equation, a = 1, b = -a, and c = -a. So, the discriminant is:\n  (-a)\u00b2 - 4(1)(-a) = a\u00b2 + 4a\n**4. Set the discriminant to zero and solve:**\nWe want the discriminant to be zero:\n  a\u00b2 + 4a = 0\nFactor out an 'a':\n  a(a + 4) = 0\nThis gives us two possible solutions:\n  a = 0  or  a = -4\n**5. Check for validity:**\nWe need to check if these solutions actually result in the graphs intersecting once.\n* **a = 0:** The equation becomes x\u00b2 = 0, which has only one solution (x = 0). So, a = 0 is a valid solution.\n* **a = -4:** The equation becomes x\u00b2 + 4x + 4 = 0, which factors to (x + 2)\u00b2 = 0. This also has only one solution (x = -2). So, a = -4 is also a valid solution.\n**6. Find the sum:**\nFinally, the sum of the possible values of 'a' is:\n  0 + (-4) = **-4** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**1. Understand the Problem**\nWe're looking for values of 'a' where the parabola  y = x\u00b2 + a and the line y = ax intersect at exactly one point. This means the graphs are tangent at that point.\n**2. Set up the Equations**\n* **Equation 1:**  y = x\u00b2 + a\n* **Equation 2:** y = ax\nSince the graphs intersect, we can set the equations equal to each other:\nx\u00b2 + a = ax\n**3. Solve for x**\nRearrange the equation to get a quadratic:\nx\u00b2 - ax + a = 0\n**4. Tangency Condition**\nFor the graphs to be tangent, the quadratic equation must have a double root (a repeated solution). This means the discriminant of the quadratic must be zero. \nThe discriminant of ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0 is b\u00b2 - 4ac.  In our case:\n(-a)\u00b2 - 4(1)(a) = 0\n**5. Solve for 'a'**\nSimplify and solve the equation:\na\u00b2 - 4a = 0\na(a - 4) = 0\nThis gives us two possible solutions:\na = 0 or a = 4\n**6. Check for Validity**\nLet's check if both solutions work:\n* **a = 0:** The equation becomes x\u00b2 = 0, which has a double root at x = 0. This solution works.\n* **a = 4:** The equation becomes x\u00b2 - 4x + 4 = 0, which factors as (x - 2)\u00b2 = 0, again giving a double root at x = 2. This solution also works.\n**7.

Apply the discriminant:**\nFor a quadratic equation of the form ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0, the discriminant is b\u00b2 - 4ac.

Therefore, the discriminant must be zero.\n**4. Calculate the discriminant:**\nIn our quadratic, a = 1, b = -a, and c = a.  Substituting into the discriminant formula:\n  (-a)\u00b2 - 4(1)(a) = 0\n**5.
