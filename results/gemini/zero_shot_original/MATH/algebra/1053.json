        "Here's how to solve for 'c' step-by-step:\n1. **Substitute 'b' and 'd' into the first equation:** \n   Since we know  b = a - 2 and d = c + 5, we can substitute these values into the first equation:\n   a - (a - 2) = 2(c + (c + 5))\n2. **Simplify the equation:**\n   Simplify both sides of the equation:\n   2 = 2(2c + 5)\n   2 = 4c + 10\n3. **Solve for 'c':**\n   Subtract 10 from both sides:\n   -8 = 4c\n   Divide both sides by 4:\n   c = **-2**\nTherefore, the solution for 'c' is **-2**. \n",
        "1. **Substitute the values of b and d into the first equation:**\n   \n   We have: \n   *  b = a - 2\n   *  d = c + 5\n   Substituting these into the first equation:\n   a - (a - 2) = 2(c + (c + 5))\n2. **Simplify the equation:**\n   The 'a' terms cancel out:\n   2 = 2(2c + 5)\n3. **Continue simplifying:**\n   Distribute the 2 on the right side:\n   2 = 4c + 10\n4. **Solve for c:**\n   Subtract 10 from both sides:\n   -8 = 4c\n   Divide both sides by 4:\n   c = -2\nTherefore, the solution for **c is -2**. \n",
