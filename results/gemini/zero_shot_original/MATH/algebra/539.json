        "Here's how to rewrite the expression and find the value of q:\n**1. Recognize the pattern:**\nThe expression $g^4 + 12g^2 + 9$ looks like a perfect square trinomial.  Specifically, it resembles the expansion of $(a^2 + b)^2 = a^4 + 2a^2b + b^2$.\n**2.  Match the terms:**\n*  We see that $a^2 = g^2$ \n*  We need to find 'b' such that $2a^2b = 12g^2$.  Solving for 'b', we get  $b = 6$.\n**3. Rewrite the expression:**\nNow, we can rewrite the original expression:\n  $g^4 + 12g^2 + 9 = (g^2)^2 + 2(g^2)(6) + 6^2 = (g^2 + 6)^2$\n**4.  Identify 'q':**\nSince we have $(g^2 + 6)^2$, the expression is already in the form  $c(g^2 + p)^2 + q$.  Here:\n* $c = 1$\n* $p = 6$\n* **$q = 0$**\n**Therefore, the value of q is 0.** \n",

Recognize the pattern:**\nThe given expression,  $g^4 + 12g^2 + 9$, resembles the expansion of a perfect square trinomial: $(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$.\n**2.  Factor the expression:**\n* Notice that the first and last terms are perfect squares:  $g^4 = (g^2)^2$ and $9 = (3)^2$.\n* The middle term, $12g^2$, is twice the product of the square roots of the first and last terms:  2 * (g^2) * (3) = 6g^2. \n* Therefore, we can factor the expression as follows:\n   \n   $g^4 + 12g^2 + 9 = (g^2 + 3)^2$\n**3.
