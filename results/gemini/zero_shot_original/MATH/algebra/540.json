    "solution": "We have that $7=x^2+y^2=x^2-2xy+y^2+2xy=(x-y)^2+2xy=1+2xy$, therefore $xy=\\frac{7-1}{2}=3$. Since $x^3-y^3=(x-y)(x^2+xy+y^2)=(x-y)(x^2+y^2+xy)$, we can directly substitute in the numerical values for each algebraic expression. This gives us $x^3-y^3=(1)(7+3)=\\boxed{10}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Factor the difference of cubes:**\n*  Recall the factorization:  a\u00b3 - b\u00b3 = (a - b)(a\u00b2 + ab + b\u00b2)\n**2.

Use the given equations to simplify:**\n*  We know (x - y) = 1.\n*  We need to find x\u00b2 + xy + y\u00b2. \n**4.  Manipulate the second given equation:**\n*  Square the equation (x - y) = 1:\n    (x - y)\u00b2 = 1\u00b2\n    x\u00b2 - 2xy + y\u00b2 = 1\n*  Add 3xy to both sides:\n    x\u00b2 + xy + y\u00b2 = 1 + 3xy\n**5.  Find the value of xy:**\n*  We need to find xy.  We can use the given equations to do this:\n    *  (x - y) = 1  =>  x = y + 1\n    *  Substitute this into the equation x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 7:\n        (y + 1)\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 7\n        y\u00b2 + 2y + 1 + y\u00b2 = 7\n        2y\u00b2 + 2y - 6 = 0\n        y\u00b2 + y - 3 = 0 \n    *  We can use the quadratic formula to solve for y:\n        y = (-1 \u00b1 \u221a(1\u00b2 - 4 * 1 * -3)) / (2 * 1)\n        y = (-1 \u00b1 \u221a13) / 2\n    *  We get two possible values for y. Since x = y + 1, there will be two corresponding values for x.\n    *  Let's find xy for both possibilities of y:\n        * If y = (-1 + \u221a13) / 2, then x = (1 + \u221a13) / 2, and xy = (1 + \u221a13) / 2 * (-1 + \u221a13) / 2 = 3\n        * If y = (-1 - \u221a13) / 2, then x = (1 - \u221a13) / 2, and xy = (1 - \u221a13) / 2 * (-1 - \u221a13) / 2 = 3\n**6.  Calculate x\u00b3 - y\u00b3:**\n* Now we can substitute the values we found:\n    * x\u00b3 - y\u00b3 = (x - y)(x\u00b2 + xy + y\u00b2)\n    * x\u00b3 - y\u00b3 = (1)(1 + 3xy)\n    * x\u00b3 - y\u00b3 = 1 + 3 * 3\n    * x\u00b3 - y\u00b3 = 10\n**Therefore, x\u00b3 - y\u00b3 = 10.** \n",
