        "Here's how to simplify the expression step-by-step:\n1. **Find the roots:**\n   *  \u221a4096 = 64 (since 64 * 64 = 4096)\n   *  \u221b4096 = 16 (since 16 * 16 * 16 = 4096)\n   *  \u221c4096 = 8 (since 8 * 8 * 8 * 8 = 4096)\n2. **Substitute the values:**\n   \u221a(64 + 16 + 8)\n3. **Add the numbers inside the square root:**\n   \u221a(88)\n4. **Simplify (if possible):**  88 is not a perfect square, so we can leave the answer as **\u221a88**.  We can also simplify this slightly by factoring out a perfect square: \u221a88 = \u221a(4 * 22) = 2\u221a22\n**Therefore, the simplified expression is \u221a88 or 2\u221a22.** \n",
