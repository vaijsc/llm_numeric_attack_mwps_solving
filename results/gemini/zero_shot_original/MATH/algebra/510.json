        "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n1. **Start with the innermost function:**  We have  $f(2)$. Since 2 is even, we use the second part of the definition: \n   \\[f(2) = 2^2 - 3(2) + 1 = -1.\\]\n2. **Next layer:** We now need to find $f(f(2))$, which is $f(-1)$.  Since -1 is odd, we use the first part of the definition:\n   \\[f(-1) = (-1)^2 + 1 = 2.\\]\n3. **Continuing:** We have $f(f(f(2)))$, which is $f(f(-1)) = f(2)$. We already know that $f(2) = -1$.\n4. **Two more layers:**  We now have $f(f(f(f(2))))$, which is $f(f(-1)) = f(2) = -1$.\n5. **The final layer:**  Finally, we have $f(f(f(f(f(f(2)))))) = f(f(f(f(-1)))) = f(f(f(2))) = f(f(-1)) = f(2) = \\boxed{-1}$. \n",
