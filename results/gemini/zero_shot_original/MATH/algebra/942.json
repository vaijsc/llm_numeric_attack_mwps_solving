        "Here's how to find the integer between those cube roots:\n**1. Understand Cube Roots**\n* A cube root of a number is the value that, when multiplied by itself three times, equals the original number. For example, the cube root of 8 is 2 because 2 x 2 x 2 = 8.\n* Cube roots of negative numbers are negative.\n**2. Estimate the Cube Roots**\n* **-45:**  Since  -3 x -3 x -3 = -27, and -4 x -4 x -4 = -64, we know that the cube root of -45 lies between -3 and -4.\n* **-101:** Since -5 x -5 x -5 = -125, the cube root of -101 lies between -4 and -5.\n**3. Find the Integer**\nWe now know that the cube root of -45 is between -3 and -4, and the cube root of -101 is between -4 and -5. The only integer that falls between these two ranges is **-4**.\n**Therefore, the integer that lies between the cube root of -45 and the cube root of -101 is -4.** \n",
