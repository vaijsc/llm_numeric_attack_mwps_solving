        "We know that $9 \\times 9 = 81$.  Therefore, the smallest number $y$ such that $y^2 = 81$ is $\\boxed{9}$. \n",
        "1. **Understanding the problem:** We need to find a number that, when multiplied by itself, equals 81. \n2. **Finding the square root:**  The number we are looking for is the square root of 81.\n3. **Calculating:** We know that 9 * 9 = 81. \n4. **Solution:** Therefore, the smallest number y such that y\u00b2 = 81 is **y = 9**. \n",
        "1. **Understand the question:** We need to find a number that, when multiplied by itself, equals 81. \n2. **Consider factors of 81:** Think of numbers that divide evenly into 81.  Some possibilities are:\n    * 1 and 81 \n    * 3 and 27\n    * 9 and 9\n3. **Identify the smallest number:** Since 9 multiplied by itself equals 81, and it's the smallest number in the list of factors that works,  the answer is **9**. \n",
