    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "There are two ways to do this quickly: Set $\\frac{n^2-n}{2} = 55$, multiply both sides by 2, so that you have $n^2 - n = 110$.  Then, quickly notice that $n = 11$ is the only number conceivably close enough such that that equation will work (namely, $n = 10$ is too small, and $n = 12$ is too big, since 144 is way greater than 110.)  If you do the problem in this manner, you should do it all in your head so as to be able to do it more quickly (and you gain nothing from writing it out).\n\nThe other way is to quickly factor the numerator to $n(n-1)$, and once again multiply both sides by 2.  Then, you'll have $n(n-1) = 110$, from which you should recognize that both 10 and 11 are factors, from which you get $n = \\boxed{11}$.\n\nWe can also solve this as a quadratic equation. $n(n-1) = 110$ becomes $n^2 - n - 110 = 0$. Factoring, we find that $(n - 11)(n + 10) = 0.$ This gives us $n = 11$ or $n = -10,$ but $n$ must be positive, so $n = \\boxed{11}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Set up the equation:**\nWe know the formula for the number of games in a round-robin tournament is (n^2 - n)/2.  We're given that 55 games are played.  So we can set up the equation:\n(n^2 - n)/2 = 55\n**2. Solve for n:**\n* **Multiply both sides by 2:** n^2 - n = 110\n* **Rearrange into a quadratic equation:** n^2 - n - 110 = 0\n* **Factor the quadratic equation:** (n - 11)(n + 10) = 0\n* **Solve for n:**  n = 11 or n = -10\n**3. Choose the valid solution:**\nSince we can't have a negative number of teams, the solution n = 11 is the correct one.\n**Answer:** There are **11** teams in the round-robin tournament. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n1. **Set up the equation:** We know the number of games in a round-robin tournament is given by (n^2 - n)/2, and we're told there are 55 games.  So we have the equation:\n   (n^2 - n)/2 = 55\n2. **Simplify the equation:** Multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:\n   n^2 - n = 110\n3. **Rearrange into a quadratic equation:** Subtract 110 from both sides to get a standard quadratic equation:\n   n^2 - n - 110 = 0\n4. **Factor the quadratic:** Find two numbers that multiply to -110 and add up to -1. These numbers are -11 and 10. So we can factor the equation:\n   (n - 11)(n + 10) = 0\n5. **Solve for n:** For the product of two factors to be zero, at least one of them must be zero.  So we have two possible solutions:\n   * n - 11 = 0  =>  n = 11\n   * n + 10 = 0  => n = -10\n6. **Choose the valid solution:** Since we can't have a negative number of teams, the valid solution is n = 11.\n**Therefore, there are 11 teams in the round-robin tournament.** \n",
