    "solution": "Let $r$ be the annual interest rate.  Then after three years, Mr. Madoff's investment is $1000 \\cdot \\left( 1 + \\frac{r}{100} \\right)^3$, so \\[1000 \\cdot \\left( 1 + \\frac{r}{100} \\right)^3 = 1225.\\]Then \\[\\left( 1 + \\frac{r}{100} \\right)^3 = 1.225,\\]so \\[1 + \\frac{r}{100} = \\sqrt[3]{1.225} = 1.069987 \\dots,\\]which means $r = \\boxed{7}$, to the nearest integer.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand Compound Interest**\nCompound interest means that the interest earned each year is added to the principal, and then the next year's interest is calculated on the new, larger principal.\n**2. Set Up the Formula**\nThe formula for compound interest is:\nA = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)\nWhere:\n* A = the future value of the investment/loan, including interest\n* P = the principal investment amount (the initial deposit or loan amount)\n* r = the annual interest rate (as a decimal)\n* n = the number of times that interest is compounded per year\n* t = the number of years the money is invested or borrowed for\n**3. Plug in the Known Values**\n* A = $1225 \n* P = $1000\n* n = 1 (compounded annually)\n* t = 3 years\nOur equation becomes:\n$1225 = $1000(1 + r/1)^(1*3)\n**4. Simplify and Solve for 'r'**\n* $1225 = $1000(1 + r)^3\n* 1.225 = (1 + r)^3\n* (1.225)^(1/3) = 1 + r \n* 1.072... = 1 + r\n* r \u2248 0.072 \n**5. Convert to Percentage**\nMultiply the decimal value of 'r' by 100 to express it as a percentage:\n0.072 * 100 = 7.2%\n**Answer:** The annual interest rate is approximately **7%**. \n",
