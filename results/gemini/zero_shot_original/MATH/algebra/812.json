        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Midpoint Property**\nSince the origin (0, 0) is the midpoint of segment AB, the coordinates of point A and point B are symmetric about the origin.  This means:\n* If point A has coordinates (x, y), then point B has coordinates (-x, -y).\n**2. Substitute Coordinates into the Equation**\n* **Point A:** Let point A have coordinates (x, y).  Since it lies on the parabola, we know  y = 3x\u00b2 - 5x - 3.\n* **Point B:**  Point B has coordinates (-x, -y).  Since it also lies on the parabola, we know -y = 3(-x)\u00b2 - 5(-x) - 3.\n**3. Simplify the Equation for Point B**\nThe equation for point B simplifies to:\n-y = 3x\u00b2 + 5x - 3\n**4. Solve for y**\nMultiply both sides of the equation by -1 to get:\ny = -3x\u00b2 - 5x + 3\n**5.  Set the y-values Equal**\nSince both points A and B lie on the same parabola, their y-values must be equal.  Therefore:\n3x\u00b2 - 5x - 3 = -3x\u00b2 - 5x + 3\n**6. Solve for x**\nSimplify the equation:\n6x\u00b2 = 6\nx\u00b2 = 1\nx = \u00b11\n**7. Find the Coordinates of A and B**\n* **If x = 1:**  y = 3(1)\u00b2 - 5(1) - 3 = -5.  Point A is (1, -5) and Point B is (-1, 5).\n* **If x = -1:** y = 3(-1)\u00b2 - 5(-1) - 3 = 5.  Point A is (-1, 5) and Point B is (1, -5).\n**8. Calculate the Length of AB**\nUsing the distance formula:\nAB\u00b2 = (1 - (-1))\u00b2 + (-5 - 5)\u00b2 = 2\u00b2 + (-10)\u00b2 = 104\n**Answer:** The square of the length of AB is **104**. \n",
        "Here's a step-by-step solution:\n**1. Understand the Problem**\nWe are given a parabola and told that the origin (0,0) is the midpoint of a segment AB, where A and B are points on the parabola. We need to find the square of the length of segment AB.\n**2. Use the Midpoint Formula**\nSince the origin is the midpoint of AB, we can use the midpoint formula:\nMidpoint = ((x1 + x2)/2, (y1 + y2)/2)\nSince the midpoint is (0,0), we have:\n(x1 + x2)/2 = 0  => x1 + x2 = 0\n(y1 + y2)/2 = 0  => y1 + y2 = 0\n**3. Use the Equation of the Parabola**\nPoints A and B lie on the parabola, so their coordinates satisfy the equation y = 3x\u00b2 - 5x - 3.  Let's denote the x-coordinates of A and B as 'a' and 'b', respectively. Then:\n* y1 = 3a\u00b2 - 5a - 3\n* y2 = 3b\u00b2 - 5b - 3\n**4. Substitute into the Equations from Step 2**\nSubstitute the expressions for y1 and y2 into the equation (y1 + y2) = 0:\n(3a\u00b2 - 5a - 3) + (3b\u00b2 - 5b - 3) = 0\nSimplify the equation:\n3a\u00b2 + 3b\u00b2 - 5a - 5b - 6 = 0\n**5. Factor and Use the Relationship x1 + x2 = 0**\nNotice that we can factor the equation:\n3(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) - 5(a + b) - 6 = 0\nFrom step 2, we know a + b = 0. Substitute this into the equation:\n3(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) - 6 = 0\n**6. Find a\u00b2 + b\u00b2**\nSolve for (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2):\n3(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) = 6\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 2\n**7. Calculate the Square of the Length of AB**\nThe square of the length of AB is:\n(AB)\u00b2 = (a - b)\u00b2 + (y1 - y2)\u00b2\nExpand the equation:\n(AB)\u00b2 = a\u00b2 - 2ab + b\u00b2 + (3a\u00b2 - 5a - 3 - (3b\u00b2 - 5b - 3))\u00b2\nSimplify using a + b = 0 and a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 2:\n(AB)\u00b2 = 2 + 0 + (3(2) - 0 - 6)\u00b2\n(AB)\u00b2 = 2 + 0 = 2\n**Therefore, the square of the length of AB is 2.** \n",

This means:\n* If point A has coordinates (x, y), then point B has coordinates (-x, -y).\n**2. Use the Parabola Equation**\n* **Point A:**  Let the x-coordinate of point A be 'x'.  Then its y-coordinate is given by the parabola's equation:  y = 3x\u00b2 - 5x - 3 \n* **Point B:** The x-coordinate of point B is '-x', and its y-coordinate is given by: -y = 3(-x)\u00b2 - 5(-x) - 3  \n**3. Simplify and Solve**\nThe equation for point B simplifies to: -y = 3x\u00b2 + 5x - 3.  \nNow, we have two equations:\n* y = 3x\u00b2 - 5x - 3\n* -y = 3x\u00b2 + 5x - 3\nAdd these equations together: 0 = 6x\u00b2 - 6. \nSolve for x:\n* 6x\u00b2 = 6\n* x\u00b2 = 1\n* x = \u00b11\n**4. Find the Coordinates of A and B**\nWe have two possible values for x: 1 and -1.  Let's find the coordinates of A and B for each case:\n* **Case 1: x = 1**\n    * A: (1, 3(1)\u00b2 - 5(1) - 3) = (1, -5)\n    * B: (-1, -(-5)) = (-1, 5)\n* **Case 2: x = -1**\n    * A: (-1, 3(-1)\u00b2 - 5(-1) - 3) = (-1, 5)\n    * B: (1, -5)\n**5. Calculate the Distance**\nRegardless of which case we use, the distance between points A and B is the same.  Let's use the coordinates from Case 1:\n* A(1, -5) and B(-1, 5)\nUsing the distance formula:\nDistance\u00b2 = (1 - (-1))\u00b2 + (-5 - 5)\u00b2 \nDistance\u00b2 = 2\u00b2 + (-10)\u00b2\nDistance\u00b2 = 104\n**Answer:** The square of the length of AB is **104**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Problem**\nWe're given a parabola and told that the midpoint of a segment connecting two points on the parabola is the origin. Our goal is to find the squared length of that segment.\n**2. Use Midpoint Formula**\nSince the origin (0,0) is the midpoint of AB, we can use the midpoint formula:\n* Midpoint =  ((x1 + x2)/2, (y1 + y2)/2)\nSince the midpoint is (0,0), we have:\n* (x1 + x2)/2 = 0 \n* (y1 + y2)/2 = 0\nThis tells us x1 = -x2 and y1 = -y2.\n**3.

Solve for x2**\nSimplify the equation:\n* 3x2^2 + 5x2 - 3 = 0\nWe can use the quadratic formula to solve for x2:\n* x2 = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n* x2 = (-5 \u00b1 \u221a(5^2 - 4 * 3 * -3)) / (2 * 3)\n* x2 = (-5 \u00b1 \u221a73) / 6\n**6. Find the Length of AB**\nSince x1 = -x2, we have two possible solutions for (x1, y1) and (x2, y2):\n*  (x1, y1) = ((5 - \u221a73)/6, (3(5 - \u221a73)^2/36 + 5(5 - \u221a73)/6 - 3) \n   and (x2, y2) = ((-5 + \u221a73)/6, (3(-5 + \u221a73)^2/36 + 5(-5 + \u221a73)/6 - 3)\n* (x1, y1) = ((-5 + \u221a73)/6, (3(-5 + \u221a73)^2/36 + 5(-5 + \u221a73)/6 - 3) \n    and (x2, y2) = ((5 - \u221a73)/6, (3(5 - \u221a73)^2/36 + 5(5 - \u221a73)/6 - 3)\nNow, use the distance formula to find the length of AB for either of the solutions:\n* AB = \u221a((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2)\nAfter plugging in the values and simplifying, you will find that the square of the length of AB is **73/9**. \n",
