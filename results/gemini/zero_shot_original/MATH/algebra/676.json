    "problem": "William runs at a constant speed of 8 miles per hour. Running at this constant speed, it takes William 75 seconds to run from his house to school. How many miles did William run?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "William ran for 75 seconds, which we will have to convert to miles. We know have conversion factors to get from seconds to hours, namely $\\frac{1\\text{ minute}}{60 \\text{ seconds}} = 1$ and $\\frac{1\\text{ hour}}{60 \\text{ minutes}} = 1$. We are also given William's running speed, so $\\frac{8\\text{ miles}}{1 \\text{ hour}} = 1$. Thus, we can find that William ran \\[ 75\\text{ seconds}\\cdot \\frac{1\\text{ minute}}{60 \\text{ seconds}} \\cdot \\frac{1\\text{ hour}}{60 \\text{ minutes}} \\cdot \\frac{8\\text{ miles}}{1 \\text{ hour}} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}\\text{ miles.}\\]",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Convert time to hours:**\n* There are 60 minutes in an hour and 60 seconds in a minute.\n* William's running time in hours is 75 seconds / 60 seconds/minute / 60 minutes/hour = 0.020833 hours (approximately).\n**2. Use the formula: distance = speed x time**\n* Speed = 8 miles per hour\n* Time = 0.020833 hours\n* Distance = 8 miles/hour * 0.020833 hours = **0.166664 miles** (approximately)\n**Therefore, William ran approximately 0.166664 miles.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Convert Time to Hours:**\n* There are 60 minutes in an hour, and 60 seconds in a minute. \n* So, 75 seconds is equal to 75/60 = 1.25 minutes.\n* And 1.25 minutes is equal to 1.25/60 = 0.0208333 hours (approximately).\n**2. Use the Formula: Distance = Speed x Time**\n* William's speed is 8 miles per hour.\n* The time he ran is 0.0208333 hours.\n* Distance = 8 miles/hour * 0.0208333 hours = 0.1666664 miles (approximately)\n**Answer:** William ran approximately **0.1667 miles**. \n",
