        "Here's how to find the 2003rd term of the sequence of odd numbers:\n* **Understanding the Pattern:**  Each odd number is 2 more than the previous one.  This means the sequence is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 2.\n* **General Formula:** The general formula for an arithmetic sequence is: \n   * a<sub>n</sub> = a<sub>1</sub> + (n - 1)d \n   where:\n      * a<sub>n</sub> is the nth term\n      * a<sub>1</sub> is the first term\n      * d is the common difference\n      * n is the term number\n* **Applying the Formula:**\n    * a<sub>1</sub> = 1 (the first odd number)\n    * d = 2 (the difference between consecutive odd numbers)\n    * n = 2003 (we want the 2003rd term)\n    * a<sub>2003</sub> = 1 + (2003 - 1) * 2\n    * a<sub>2003</sub> = 1 + 2002 * 2\n    * a<sub>2003</sub> = 1 + 4004\n    * a<sub>2003</sub> = 4005\n**Therefore, the 2003rd term of the sequence of odd numbers is 4005.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this:\n* **Understanding the Pattern:** The sequence of odd numbers increases by 2 with each term. \n* **Finding the Formula:**  We can represent the nth term of this sequence with the formula: 2n - 1\n* **Applying the Formula:** To find the 2003rd term, we substitute n = 2003 into the formula: 2(2003) - 1 \n* **Calculation:** 4006 - 1 = 4005\n**Therefore, the 2003rd term of the sequence of odd numbers is 4005.** \n",
        "Here's how to find the 2003rd term of the sequence of odd numbers:\n**Understanding the Pattern**\n* The sequence of odd numbers is formed by adding 2 to the previous term: 1 + 2 = 3, 3 + 2 = 5, and so on. \n* This means each odd number is 2 more than the one before it.\n**Finding the Formula**\n* The first odd number is 1.\n* The second odd number is 1 + 2 = 3.\n* The third odd number is 1 + (2 * 2) = 5\n* The fourth odd number is 1 + (2 * 3) = 7\n*  And so on...\nNotice a pattern?  The *n*th odd number is given by the formula: 1 + 2(n - 1)\n**Calculating the 2003rd Term**\nTo find the 2003rd term, we substitute *n* = 2003 into our formula:\n1 + 2(2003 - 1) = 1 + 2(2002) = 1 + 4004 = 4005\n**Answer:** The 2003rd term of the sequence of odd numbers is **4005**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this:\n* **Understanding the Pattern:**  Odd numbers increase by 2 each time. \n* **General Formula:**  The nth odd number can be represented by the formula:  2n - 1\n* **Finding the 2003rd Term:** Substitute n = 2003 into the formula:\n   * 2(2003) - 1 = 4006 - 1 = 4005\n**Therefore, the 2003rd term of the sequence of odd numbers is 4005.** \n",
