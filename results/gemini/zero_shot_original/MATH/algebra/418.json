    "problem": "At her track meet, Alice ran at a speed of $9\\ \\text{m/s}$ for $12$ seconds. How many meters did she run?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Letting $v$ denote speed, $x$ denote distance, and $t$ denote time, we have $v=\\frac{x}{t}$. In our problem, we're given that $v=9\\ \\text{m/s}$ and $t=12\\ \\text{s}$. Solving for the distance, we find that $x=vt=\\boxed{108}\\ \\text{m}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n* **Understand the relationship:**  Speed, distance, and time are related by the formula:  Distance = Speed \u00d7 Time.\n* **Plug in the values:** Alice's speed is 9 m/s, and her time is 12 seconds. \n* **Calculate the distance:** Distance = 9 m/s \u00d7 12 s = 108 meters.\n**Answer:** Alice ran 108 meters. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n* **Understand the information:** Alice's speed is 9 meters per second, meaning she covers 9 meters every second. She ran for 12 seconds.\n* **Calculate the distance:** To find the total distance, multiply her speed by the time she ran: 9 m/s * 12 s = 108 meters.\n**Answer:** Alice ran 108 meters. \n",
