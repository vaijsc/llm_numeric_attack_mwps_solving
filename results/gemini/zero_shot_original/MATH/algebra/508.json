        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Distance Formula**\nThe distance formula helps us calculate the distance between two points in a coordinate plane:\n* Distance =  \u221a[(x\u2082 - x\u2081)\u00b2 + (y\u2082 - y\u2081)\u00b2]\n**2. Apply the Distance Formula**\n* We know the distance between the two points is 5.\n* One endpoint is (1, 2) (let's call this (x\u2081, y\u2081)).\n* The other endpoint is (4, b) (let's call this (x\u2082, y\u2082)).\nSubstitute these values into the distance formula:\n5 = \u221a[(4 - 1)\u00b2 + (b - 2)\u00b2]\n**3. Simplify and Solve for b**\n* Simplify the equation: 5 = \u221a[(3)\u00b2 + (b - 2)\u00b2]\n* Square both sides: 25 = 9 + (b - 2)\u00b2\n* Subtract 9 from both sides: 16 = (b - 2)\u00b2\n* Take the square root of both sides (remembering both positive and negative solutions): \u00b14 = b - 2\n* Solve for b: \n    * b = 4 + 2 = 6\n    * b = -4 + 2 = -2\n**Answer:**\nThe possible values of b are **-2, 6**. \n",
