        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the common difference:**\n* An arithmetic sequence has a constant difference between consecutive terms. We call this the common difference (d).\n* The ninth term is 8 terms ahead of the first term.\n* The difference between the ninth term and the first term is (4/5) - (2/3) = 2/15.\n* Since there are 8 terms in between, the common difference is (2/15) / 8 = 1/60.\n**2. Find the fifth term:**\n* The fifth term is 4 terms ahead of the first term.\n* The fifth term is equal to the first term plus 4 times the common difference: (2/3) + 4(1/60) = (2/3) + (1/15) = 11/15.\n**Therefore, the fifth term of the arithmetic sequence is 11/15.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the common difference:**\n* An arithmetic sequence has a constant difference between consecutive terms. Let's call this common difference *d*.\n* We know the first term is 2/3 and the ninth term is 4/5. Since there are 8 terms between them, the total difference is (4/5) - (2/3) = 2/15.\n* The common difference is this total difference divided by the number of terms: (2/15) / 8 = 1/60.\n**2. Find the fifth term:**\n* The fifth term is 4 terms after the first term.\n* To find the fifth term, add 4 times the common difference to the first term: (2/3) + 4*(1/60) = 2/3 + 1/15 = 11/15.\n**Therefore, the fifth term of the arithmetic sequence is 11/15.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the common difference:**\n* The arithmetic sequence has a constant difference between terms, called the common difference. Let's call this difference *d*.\n* Since the 9th term is $\\frac{4}{5}$ and the 1st term is $\\frac{2}{3}$, there are 8 terms between them.\n* The difference between the 9th and 1st term is  $\\frac{4}{5} - \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{2}{15}$. \n* This difference is spread over 8 terms, so the common difference is  *d* =  $\\frac{2}{15} / 8 = \\frac{1}{60}$.\n**2. Find the 5th term:**\n* The 5th term is 4 terms after the 1st term.\n* To find the 5th term, add 4 times the common difference to the 1st term: \n   *  $\\frac{2}{3} + 4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{60} = \\frac{2}{3} + \\frac{1}{15} = \\frac{11}{15}$\n**Therefore, the fifth term of the arithmetic sequence is  11/15.** \n",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand Arithmetic Sequences**\nAn arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers where the difference between any two consecutive terms is constant. This constant difference is called the common difference.\n**2. Find the Common Difference**\n* We know the first term (a\u2081) is 2/3 and the ninth term (a\u2089) is 4/5.\n* The formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is: a\u2099 = a\u2081 + (n-1)d, where 'd' is the common difference.\n* Substituting the given values, we get: 4/5 = 2/3 + (9-1)d\n* Simplifying the equation: 4/5 - 2/3 = 8d\n* Finding a common denominator: (12 - 10)/15 = 8d\n* Solving for 'd': 2/15 = 8d => d = 1/60\n**3. Find the Fifth Term**\n* Using the formula a\u2099 = a\u2081 + (n-1)d, we can find the fifth term (a\u2085):\n* a\u2085 = 2/3 + (5-1)(1/60)\n* a\u2085 = 2/3 + 4/60\n* a\u2085 = 2/3 + 1/15\n* a\u2085 = (10 + 1)/15\n* a\u2085 = 11/15\n**Therefore, the fifth term of the arithmetic sequence is 11/15.** \n"
