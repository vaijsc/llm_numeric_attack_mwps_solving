        "**1. Factoring the quadratic:**\n* We need to find two numbers that add up to 24 (the coefficient of the x term) and multiply to 128 (the constant term).\n* These numbers are 16 and 8, since 16 + 8 = 24 and 16 * 8 = 128.\n* Therefore, we can factor the quadratic as: (x + 16)(x + 8) = 0\n**2. Solving for x:**\n* For the product of two factors to be zero, at least one of them must be zero.\n*  So, either (x + 16) = 0 or (x + 8) = 0\n* Solving these equations, we get:\n    * x = -16\n    * x = -8\n**3. Determining the largest value:**\n* Comparing the two solutions, the larger value of x is **-8**. \nTherefore, the largest value of x that satisfies the equation is **-8**. \n",
        "1. **Factor the quadratic:** The quadratic expression factors as $(x+8)(x+16) = 0$.\n2. **Set each factor to zero:** This gives us two possible solutions:\n   *  $x + 8 = 0  \\Rightarrow x = -8$\n   *  $x + 16 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = -16$\n3. **Identify the largest value:** Since $-8$ is greater than $-16$, the largest value of $x$ that satisfies the equation is $\\boxed{-8}$. \n",
