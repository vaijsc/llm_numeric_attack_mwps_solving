        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the given information:**\n* **Arithmetic sequence:**  The terms in an arithmetic sequence have a constant difference between them.  Since $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are in arithmetic sequence, we can write:\n    *  $b = a + r$\n    *  $c = a + 2r$\n    *  $d = a + 3r$   (where $r$ is the common difference)\n* **Geometric sequence:** The terms in a geometric sequence have a constant ratio between them. Since $a$, $b$, and $d$ are in geometric sequence, we can write:\n    *  $b = ar$\n    *  $d = ar^2$   (where $r$ is the common ratio)\n**2. Use the equations to find a relationship:**\n* Notice that we have two expressions for $b$:\n    *  $b = a + r$ \n    *  $b = ar$\n*  Setting these equal to each other, we get: \n    *  $a + r = ar$\n**3. Solve for the ratio a/d:**\n* Rearrange the equation from step 2:\n    *  $ar - a = r$\n    *  $a(r-1) = r$\n    *  $a = \\frac{r}{r-1}$ \n* Now, consider the expression for $d$:\n    *  $d = ar^2$\n* Substitute the value of $a$ we found:\n    *  $d = \\left(\\frac{r}{r-1}\\right)r^2$\n    *  $d = \\frac{r^3}{r-1}$\n* Finally, find the ratio $a/d$:\n    *  $\\frac{a}{d} = \\frac{\\frac{r}{r-1}}{\\frac{r^3}{r-1}}$\n    *  $\\frac{a}{d} = \\frac{r}{r-1} \\cdot \\frac{r-1}{r^3}$\n    *  $\\frac{a}{d} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{r^2}}$ \n**Therefore, the value of a/d is 1/r\u00b2, where r is the common ratio of the geometric sequence.** \n",

Understanding the given information:**\n* **Arithmetic sequence:**  Since  a, b, c, d form an arithmetic sequence, there is a common difference, let's call it 'k', such that:\n    * b = a + k\n    * c = b + k = a + 2k\n    * d = c + k = a + 3k\n* **Geometric sequence:** Since a, b, d form a geometric sequence, there is a common ratio, let's call it 'r', such that:\n    * b = a * r\n    * d = b * r = a * r\u00b2\n**2. Setting up equations and solving:**\nWe have two expressions for 'b' and two for 'd'. Let's equate them:\n* **From arithmetic sequence:**  b = a + k\n* **From geometric sequence:** b = a * r\n  Therefore, a + k = a * r  \n* **From arithmetic sequence:** d = a + 3k\n* **From geometric sequence:** d = a * r\u00b2\n  Therefore, a + 3k = a * r\u00b2\n**3. Solving for the ratio a/d:**\nNow we have two equations with two unknowns (k and r). Let's solve for 'r' in terms of 'a' and 'k' from the first equation:\n* a + k = a * r\n* r = (a + k)/a\nSubstitute this value of 'r' into the second equation:\n* a + 3k = a * [(a + k)/a]\u00b2\n* a + 3k = (a + k)\u00b2 / a\n* a\u00b2 + 3ak = a\u00b2 + 2ak + k\u00b2\n* ak = k\u00b2 \n* Since 'k' is a common difference and all numbers are positive, k \u2260 0. Therefore, we can divide both sides by 'k':\n* a = k\nNow, substitute this value of 'k' into the expression for 'r':\n* r = (a + k)/a\n* r = (a + a)/a\n* r = 2\nFinally,  we can find the value of a/d:\n* d = a * r\u00b2 \n* d = a * 2\u00b2\n* d = 4a\n* a/d = **1/4**\n**Therefore, the value of a/d is 1/4.** \n",

Find the value of a/d:**\nNow, we can express *d* in terms of *a*:\n*  *d* = *a* * q\u00b2 = *a* * 2\u00b2 = 4*a*\nTherefore,\n*  *a/d* = *a* / (4*a*) = **1/4** \n",
