        "Here's how to rationalize the denominator of $\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}$:\n1. **Separate the radical:**  We can rewrite the expression as: \n   $$\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{3}}$$\n2. **Multiply by 1 (in a clever way):**  To get rid of the radical in the denominator, we'll multiply by $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}}$ (which is just 1):\n   $$\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{3}} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}}$$\n3. **Simplify:**\n   $$\\frac{\\sqrt{2}\\cdot\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}\\cdot\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{3}$$\n**Therefore, the rationalized form of $\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}$ is $\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{3}$.** \n",
        "Here's how to rationalize the denominator of $\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}$:\n**1. Separate the radical:**\nWe can rewrite the expression as: \n  \n  \u221a(2/3) = \u221a2 / \u221a3\n**2. Multiply by \u221a3/\u221a3:**\nSince \u221a3/\u221a3 = 1, multiplying by this fraction doesn't change the value of our expression:\n  (\u221a2 / \u221a3) * (\u221a3 / \u221a3)\n**3. Simplify:**\n  (\u221a2 * \u221a3) / (\u221a3 * \u221a3) = \u221a6 / 3\n**Therefore, the rationalized form of \u221a(2/3) is \u221a6 / 3.** \n",

        "Here's how to rationalize the denominator of $\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}$:\n**1. Separate the radical:**\n   Since the square root of a fraction is equal to the fraction of the square roots, we can rewrite the expression as:\n   $$\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{3}}$$\n**2. Multiply by $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}}$:**\n   We're essentially multiplying by 1, which doesn't change the value of the expression.
