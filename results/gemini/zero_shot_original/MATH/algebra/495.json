So we have  \\begin{align*}\n-8x^2-10x+3&\\ge 0\\\\\n8x^2+10x-3&\\le 0\\\\\n\\end{align*}Factoring by trial and error gives  $$ (4x-1)(2x+3)\\le 0$$Thus the roots of $8x^2+10x-3$ are $\\frac{1}{4}$ and $-\\frac{3}{2}$. Since we know the function $ 8x^2+10x-3$ is a parabola that opens up, its value is negative between the roots. Thus, our inequality is satisfied when $-\\frac{3}{2}\\le x \\le \\frac{1}{4}$.

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Composition**\nThe expression  *p(q(x))* means we're plugging the function *q(x)* into the function *p(x)*.  This means:\n*  We start with an input value *x*.\n*  We calculate *q(x) = 8x\u00b2 + 10x - 3*. \n*  We then plug this result into *p(x) = \u221a(-x)*.\n**2. Determine Restrictions on q(x)**\nSince *p(x)* is the square root of a negative number, the output of *q(x)* (which gets plugged into *p(x)*) must be less than or equal to zero. So we need to solve the inequality:\n   *  8x\u00b2 + 10x - 3 \u2264 0\n**3. Solve the Inequality**\n* **Factor the quadratic:** (4x - 1)(2x + 3) \u2264 0\n* **Find the critical points:**  4x - 1 = 0  gives x = 1/4 \n                                 2x + 3 = 0 gives x = -3/2\n* **Test intervals:**  \n    *  x < -3/2 :  (negative)(negative) > 0 (not in our solution)\n    *  -3/2 < x < 1/4: (negative)(positive) < 0 (in our solution)\n    *  x > 1/4: (positive)(positive) > 0 (not in our solution)\n**4. Combine Restrictions**\nWe found that *q(x)* must be between -3/2 and 1/4 inclusive.  Therefore:\n   *  -3/2 \u2264 8x\u00b2 + 10x - 3 \u2264 1/4\n**5. Solve for x**\nWe need to solve two separate inequalities:\n* **-3/2 \u2264 8x\u00b2 + 10x - 3:**\n    *  0 \u2264 8x\u00b2 + 10x - 9/2 \n    *  16x\u00b2 + 20x - 9 \u2264 0\n    *  (8x - 3)(2x + 3) \u2264 0\n    *  x \u2264 -3/2 or x \u2265 3/8\n* **8x\u00b2 + 10x - 3 \u2264 1/4:**\n    *  8x\u00b2 + 10x - 13/4 \u2264 0\n    *  32x\u00b2 + 40x - 13 \u2264 0\n    *  (8x - 1)(4x + 13) \u2264 0\n    *  -13/4 \u2264 x \u2264 1/8\n**6. Determine the Domain**\nCombining the solutions, we get the domain of *p(q(x))* to be:\n   *  -13/4 \u2264 x \u2264 1/8 \n**7. Calculate b - a**\nFinally, \n   *  b - a = (1/8) - (-13/4) = 15/8\n**Therefore, b - a = 15/8** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Domain Restrictions**\n* **Inner Function (q(x))**: The quadratic function  $q(x) = 8x^2 + 10x - 3$ has no restrictions on its domain. It can take on any real number as input.\n* **Outer Function (p(x))**: The square root function, $p(x) = \\sqrt{-x}$, requires its input to be non-negative. In other words, $-x \\ge 0$.  Solving for *x*, we find  $x \\le 0$.\n**2. Apply the Restrictions to the Composite Function**\nThe composite function, $p(q(x))$, means we're plugging the output of $q(x)$ into the input of $p(x)$.  Therefore, we need to find the values of *x* that make  $q(x) \\le 0$.\n**3. Solve the Inequality**\n* **Factor q(x):**  $q(x) = 8x^2 + 10x - 3 = (4x - 1)(2x + 3)$\n* **Find the Roots:** The roots of the quadratic are $x = \\frac{1}{4}$ and $x = -\\frac{3}{2}$.\n* **Sign Chart:**  We create a sign chart to analyze the behavior of $q(x)$ around its roots.\n| Interval    |  $x < -\\frac{3}{2}$ | $-\\frac{3}{2} < x < \\frac{1}{4}$ | $x > \\frac{1}{4}$  |\n|-------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------|\n|  $4x - 1$  |       -                |             +              |       +           |\n|  $2x + 3$  |       -                |             -              |       +           |\n|  $q(x)$      |       +                |             +              |       +           |\n* **Solution:**  The inequality $q(x) \\le 0$ is true only when $-\\frac{3}{2} \\le x \\le \\frac{1}{4}$.\n**4.

Domain Restrictions of *p(x)***\n* The function *p(x) = \u221a(-x)* is a square root function.  Square roots can only be taken of non-negative numbers. Therefore, the expression inside the square root, -x, must be greater than or equal to zero:\n   - -x \u2265 0\n   - x \u2264 0 \n**3.

There are no restrictions on the values of *x* that can be plugged into *q(x)*.\n**4.

These roots divide the number line into three intervals:\n* x \u2264 -3/2\n* -3/2 \u2264 x \u2264 1/4\n* x \u2265 1/4\nWe need to find the interval(s) where the inequality holds true.
