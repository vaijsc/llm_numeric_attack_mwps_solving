        "Here's how to solve this problem using a handy algebraic trick:\n**1. Difference of Squares**\nThe expression  $255^2 - 245^2$  fits the pattern of the difference of squares:  \n*  a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = (a + b)(a - b)\n**2. Apply the Formula**\nIn this case, a = 255 and b = 245.  Let's substitute and solve:\n* (255 + 245)(255 - 245) = (500)(10) = **5000**\n**Therefore, the value of 255\u00b2 - 245\u00b2 is 5000.** \n",
