        "Here's how to find the minimum value of the quadratic expression:\n**1. Recognize the Form:**\nThe expression  $9x^2 + 18x + 7$ is a quadratic expression in the form of  *ax\u00b2 + bx + c*.\n**2.  Complete the Square:**\n* **Factor out the leading coefficient (9):** \n   $9(x^2 + 2x) + 7$\n* **Take half of the coefficient of the x term (2), square it (1), and add and subtract it inside the parentheses:**\n   $9(x^2 + 2x + 1 - 1) + 7$\n* **Rewrite the perfect square trinomial:**\n   $9(x + 1)^2 - 9 + 7$\n* **Simplify:**\n   $9(x + 1)^2 - 2$\n**3. Interpretation:**\nNow the expression is in vertex form:  *a(x - h)\u00b2 + k*.  This tells us:\n* The vertex of the parabola represented by the expression is at the point (-1, -2).\n* Since the coefficient of the squared term (9) is positive, the parabola opens upwards. \n**4. Minimum Value:**\nSince the parabola opens upwards, the vertex represents the minimum point.  Therefore, the minimum value of the expression occurs at  *x = -1*.\n**Answer:** The value of *x* that gives the minimum value of the expression is **x = -1**. \n",
        "Here's how to find the value of x that minimizes the expression:\n**1. Recognize the Form**\nThe expression  $9x^2 + 18x + 7$ is a quadratic function.  Quadratic functions have graphs that are parabolas.\n**2. Finding the Vertex**\nThe minimum (or maximum) value of a parabola occurs at its vertex.  We can find the x-coordinate of the vertex using the formula:\n  *  x = -b / 2a  \n   Where 'a' and 'b' are the coefficients of the quadratic expression:\n   *  a = 9 \n   *  b = 18\n**3. Calculate the x-coordinate**\nSubstitute the values of 'a' and 'b' into the formula:\n   * x = -18 / (2 * 9) \n   * x = -18 / 18\n   * x = -1\n**Answer:**\nThe value of *x* that gives the minimum value of the expression is **x = -1**. \n",
        "Here's how to find the minimum value of the quadratic expression:\n**1. Recognize the Form**\nThe expression  $9x^2 + 18x + 7$ is a quadratic equation in the standard form  $ax^2 + bx + c$.\n**2. Find the Vertex**\nThe minimum value of a quadratic equation occurs at its vertex. The x-coordinate of the vertex is given by:\n*  $x = -b / 2a$ \nIn our case,  $a = 9$ and $b = 18$.
