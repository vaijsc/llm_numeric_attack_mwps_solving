        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**Understanding Absolute Value**\nThe absolute value of a number is its distance from zero.  This means:\n*  |a| = a  if a is positive or zero\n*  |a| = -a if a is negative\n**The Key Insight**\nThe equation  |x + y - 7| + |4x - y + 12| = 0  tells us that the sum of two absolute values is zero.  The only way this can happen is if both absolute values are equal to zero.\n**Solving the System**\nWe now have two equations:\n1.  x + y - 7 = 0\n2.  4x - y + 12 = 0\nSolving this system of equations:\n* **Add the equations together:**  5x + 5 = 0\n* **Solve for x:**  x = -1\n* **Substitute x = -1 into either equation to solve for y:** \n   -1 + y - 7 = 0 \n   y = 8\n**The Solution**\nTherefore, the ordered pair (x, y) that satisfies the equation is **(-1, 8)**. \n",

It's always non-negative.  \n* **The Equation:** The equation states that the sum of two absolute values is equal to zero.\n**Key Insight**\nFor the sum of two non-negative numbers to be zero, both numbers must be zero.  Therefore:\n*  |x + y - 7| = 0\n*  |4x - y + 12| = 0\n**Solving for x and y**\n1. **Solve the first equation:** \n   * If |x + y - 7| = 0, then x + y - 7 = 0 \n   * Rearranging, we get: x + y = 7\n2. **Solve the second equation:**\n   * If |4x - y + 12| = 0, then 4x - y + 12 = 0\n   * Rearranging, we get: 4x - y = -12\n3. **Solve the system of equations:**\n   We now have two equations:\n      * x + y = 7\n      * 4x - y = -12\n   * We can solve this system using elimination. Adding the two equations together, we get:\n      5x = -5\n   * Solving for x, we find: x = -1\n4. **Substitute to find y:**\n   * Substitute x = -1 into either of the original equations.
