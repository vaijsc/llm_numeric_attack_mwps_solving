    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "If the arithmetic sequence of three consecutive even integers is $a, a+2, a+4$, we find the sum of the terms by multiplying the average of the first and last term $\\frac{a+(a+4)}{2}$ by the number of terms, $3$.  This gives us the equation \\[\\frac{2a+4}{2}\\cdot3 = 66.\\] Solving for $a$, we find $a = \\boxed{20}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Define variables:**\n* Let  'x' be the smallest even integer.\n* The next consecutive even integer is 'x + 2'.\n* The largest consecutive even integer is 'x + 4'.\n**2. Set up the equation:**\nThe sum of the three integers is 66, so we can write the equation:\nx + (x + 2) + (x + 4) = 66\n**3. Solve for x:**\n* Combine like terms: 3x + 6 = 66\n* Subtract 6 from both sides: 3x = 60\n* Divide both sides by 3: x = 20\n**4. Answer:**\nThe smallest of the three integers is **20**. \n",
