The sign of $f(x)-g(x)$ is positive if $f(x)>g(x)$, so we focus on the part of the graph where the dashed orange line lies above the solid dark green line.

        "To find the largest value of $f(x)-g(x)$, we need to find the point where the vertical distance between the two graphs is the greatest.  \n1. **Visual Inspection:** Looking at the graphs, the largest vertical distance seems to occur around $x=6$. \n2. **Estimation:**  Let's estimate the values of $f(6)$ and $g(6)$ from the graph:\n   *  $f(6)$ is approximately 8.\n   *  $g(6)$ is approximately 2.\n3. **Calculation:**  Therefore, the largest value of $f(x)-g(x)$ is approximately $8-2=\\boxed{6}$. \n",
        "1. **Identify the point where the difference is largest:** To find the largest value of  $f(x) - g(x)$, we need to find the point where the vertical distance between the graphs of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ is the greatest. Visually, this appears to occur around $x = 8$.\n2. **Estimate the values at that point:**  \n   * At $x = 8$,  $f(x)$ is approximately 4.\n   * At $x = 8$,  $g(x)$ is approximately 1.\n3. **Calculate the difference:**  $f(8) - g(8) \\approx 4 - 1 = 3$\nTherefore, the largest value of $f(x) - g(x)$ is approximately **3**. \n",
        "1. **Identify the points where the graphs intersect:**  The graphs of  $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ intersect at two points: one between $x=6$ and $x=8$, and another between $x=10$ and $x=12$. \n2. **Understand the concept of  $f(x) - g(x)$:** The expression $f(x) - g(x)$ represents the vertical distance between the graphs of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ at any given value of $x$.  When $f(x) > g(x)$, this distance is positive.\n3. **Find where the distance is maximized:**  We want to find the largest positive value of $f(x) - g(x)$.  This occurs where the gap between the graphs is the greatest.  Examining the graph, the largest gap occurs between the first intersection point and $x = 10$. \n4. **Estimate the maximum value:** Since the graphs are not perfectly linear, we can't get an exact answer.  However, we can see that the maximum difference occurs around $x = 8$. At this point, $f(x) \\approx 8$ and $g(x) \\approx 4$.  \n5. **Approximate the maximum value:** The largest value of $f(x) - g(x)$ is approximately $8 - 4 = \\boxed{4}$. \n",

Since the distance seems to be largest somewhere between these points, the largest value of $f(x)-g(x)$ is likely a bit bigger than 6.\n3. **Precision:** To get a more accurate answer, we could use the equations of the lines.  However, since the question only asks for the *largest* value, our estimate is sufficient.\n**Therefore, the largest value of  $f(x)-g(x)$ is a bit larger than 6.** \n"
