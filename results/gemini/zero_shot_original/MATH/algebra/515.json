    "solution": "We know one point on the line: the camera is at $(0,10)$. To find another point on the line we can determine where Tina was when she noticed her camera was missing. She travels a total of $10+8+6+4+2$ units north from the origin, so her ending $y$-coordinate is $30$. She travels $9+7+5+3+1$ units east, so her ending $x$-coordinate is $25$. So we must find the equation of the line through $(0,10)$ and $(25,30)$. The slope of the line is $\\frac{30-10}{25-0}=\\frac{20}{25}=\\frac{4}{5}$. We can use point-slope form to find that the equation of the line is $(y-10)=\\frac{4}{5}(x-0)$, or $5(y-10)=4x$. Simplifying this gives $5y-50=4x$, so in the form requested, $\\boxed{4x-5y=-50}$.",

Find the y-intercept**\nWe can use the point-slope form of a linear equation: y - y1 = m(x - x1) \n*  Let's use the point (25,30) \n*  Substitute: y - 30 = (4/5)(x - 25)\n*  Simplify: y - 30 = (4/5)x - 20\n*  Isolate y: y = (4/5)x + 10\n**5.  Express in the Required Form**\nTo get the equation in the form ax + by = c, multiply both sides by 5:\n*  5y = 4x + 50\n*  **4x - 5y = -50** \n**Therefore, the equation of the line Tina travels to get back to her camera is 4x - 5y = -50.** \n",
