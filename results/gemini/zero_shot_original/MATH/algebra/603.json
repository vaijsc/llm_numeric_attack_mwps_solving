    "solution": "Rearranging the expression, we have  \\[x^2+2x+y^2-4y+8\\]Completing the square in $x$, we need to add and subtract $(2/2)^2=1$. Completing the square in $y$, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$. Thus, we have \\[(x^2+2x+1)-1+(y^2-4y+4)-4+8 \\Rightarrow (x+1)^2+(y-2)^2+3\\]Since the minimum value of $(x+1)^2$ and $(y-2)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\\boxed{3}$, and is achieved when $x=-1$ and $y=2$.",

Complete the Square**\n* **Group the x-terms and y-terms:** \n   (x\u00b2 + 2x) + (y\u00b2 - 4y) + 8\n* **Complete the square for the x-terms:**\n   Take half of the coefficient of the x-term (which is 2), square it (1), and add and subtract it inside the parentheses:\n   (x\u00b2 + 2x + 1 - 1) + (y\u00b2 - 4y) + 8\n* **Complete the square for the y-terms:**\n   Take half of the coefficient of the y-term (which is -4), square it (4), and add and subtract it inside the parentheses:\n   (x\u00b2 + 2x + 1 - 1) + (y\u00b2 - 4y + 4 - 4) + 8\n* **Rewrite as squared terms:**\n   (x + 1)\u00b2 - 1 + (y - 2)\u00b2 - 4 + 8\n* **Simplify:**\n   (x + 1)\u00b2 + (y - 2)\u00b2 + 3\n**2. Understanding the Minimum Value**\n* **Squared terms are always non-negative:**  (x + 1)\u00b2 \u2265 0 and (y - 2)\u00b2 \u2265 0.\n* **Minimum occurs when squared terms are zero:** The expression will be minimized when (x + 1)\u00b2 = 0 and (y - 2)\u00b2 = 0. This happens when x = -1 and y = 2.\n**3. The Minimum Value**\n* **Substitute the values:** When x = -1 and y = 2, the expression becomes:\n   (-1 + 1)\u00b2 + (2 - 2)\u00b2 + 3 = 3\n**Therefore, the minimum value of the expression x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2x - 4y + 8 is 3.** \n",
