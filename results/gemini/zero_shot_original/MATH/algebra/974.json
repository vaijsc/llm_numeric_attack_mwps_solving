        "A rational function is undefined when the denominator is zero.  We need to find all the values of $x$ that make any of the denominators zero.\n* **First Denominator:** $x-64 = 0$ implies $x=64$.\n* **Second Denominator:** $x^2 - 64 = (x+8)(x-8) = 0$ implies $x=8$ or $x=-8$.\n* **Third Denominator:** $x^3 - 64 = (x-4)(x^2 + 4x + 16) = 0$.  The quadratic factor $x^2 + 4x + 16$ has no real roots (you can check this using the quadratic formula), so the only solution here is $x=4$.\nTherefore, the function is undefined for $x = -8$, $x=4$, $x=8$, and $x=64$.  Since there are **four** such values, there are **four** real numbers not in the domain of the function. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\nThe domain of a function is the set of all possible input values (x-values) for which the function produces a valid output.  A function is undefined when its denominator is zero.  So, we need to find the values of *x* that make any of the denominators in our function equal to zero.\n**2. Finding the Values that Make the Denominators Zero**\n* **Denominator 1: x - 64**\n   * This denominator is zero when x = 64.\n* **Denominator 2: x\u00b2 - 64**\n   * Factor this difference of squares: (x + 8)(x - 8)\n   * This denominator is zero when x = -8 or x = 8.\n* **Denominator 3: x\u00b3 - 64**\n   * Factor this difference of cubes: (x - 4)(x\u00b2 + 4x + 16)\n   * The quadratic factor (x\u00b2 + 4x + 16) has no real roots (you can check this using the quadratic formula or by noticing that its discriminant is negative).\n   * This denominator is zero when x = 4.\n**3. Summary of Excluded Values**\nThe values that make the denominators zero, and therefore are not in the domain, are:\n* x = 64\n* x = -8\n* x = 8\n* x = 4\n**4. Counting the Excluded Values**\nThere are **four** real numbers that are not in the domain of the function. \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Domain**\nThe domain of a function is the set of all possible input values (x-values) for which the function produces a real number output.  A function is undefined when:\n* We divide by zero. \n* We take the square root of a negative number (which is not a real number). \n* We have other operations that result in non-real numbers.\n**2. Analyze the Function**\nOur function has three terms, each with a denominator:\n* **Term 1:**  1/(x - 64) is undefined when x = 64 (because 64 - 64 = 0).\n* **Term 2:** 1/(x\u00b2 - 64) can be factored as 1/((x - 8)(x + 8)). This is undefined when x = 8 or x = -8.\n* **Term 3:** 1/(x\u00b3 - 64) can be factored as 1/((x - 4)(x\u00b2 + 4x + 16)).  The quadratic factor (x\u00b2 + 4x + 16) has no real roots (you can check this using the quadratic formula), so it doesn't introduce any additional restrictions. This term is undefined when x = 4.\n**3. Summarize the Restrictions**\nTherefore, the function is undefined for x = 64, x = 8, x = -8, and x = 4.\n**4. Determine the Number of Values Outside the Domain**\nThere are **four** real numbers that are not in the domain of the function. \n",

Understand Domain**\nThe domain of a function is the set of all possible input values (x-values) for which the function produces a valid output. \n**2. Identify Restrictions**\n* **Fractions:**  We can't divide by zero. So, any value of *x* that makes the denominator of any of the fractions zero is not in the domain. \n**3. Find the Values That Make the Denominators Zero**\n* **x - 64 = 0**  Solving for *x*, we get *x = 64*.\n* **x\u00b2 - 64 = 0** This factors as (x + 8)(x - 8) = 0, so *x = -8* and *x = 8*.\n* **x\u00b3 - 64 = 0** This factors as (x - 4)(x\u00b2 + 4x + 16) = 0.  The quadratic factor has no real roots, so the only solution is *x = 4*.\n**4. Exclude the Values**\nThe values *x = 64, x = -8, x = 8, and x = 4* make the denominators zero, so they are not in the domain of the function.\n**5.
