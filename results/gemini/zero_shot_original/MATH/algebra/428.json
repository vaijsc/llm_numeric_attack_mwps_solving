        "### Step 1: Simplify the numerator.\nThe numerator is $\\frac{3}{8} + \\frac{7}{8}$. Since they have the same denominator, we can simply add the numerators:\n$\\frac{3}{8} + \\frac{7}{8} = \\frac{10}{8}$\n### Step 2: Simplify the fraction in the numerator.\nThe fraction $\\frac{10}{8}$ can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 2:\n$\\frac{10}{8} = \\frac{10 \\div 2}{8 \\div 2} = \\frac{5}{4}$\n### Step 3: Divide the simplified numerator by the denominator.\nNow we have the expression: $\\frac{5}{4} \\div \\frac{4}{5}$. Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. The reciprocal of $\\frac{4}{5}$ is $\\frac{5}{4}$.  So:\n$\\frac{5}{4} \\div \\frac{4}{5} = \\frac{5}{4} \\times \\frac{5}{4}$\n### Step 4: Multiply the fractions.\nMultiplying fractions is done by multiplying the numerators and the denominators:\n$\\frac{5}{4} \\times \\frac{5}{4} = \\frac{5 \\times 5}{4 \\times 4} = \\frac{25}{16}$\n### Final Answer:\nTherefore, $\\cfrac{\\cfrac{3}{8}+\\cfrac{7}{8}}{\\cfrac{4}{5}}$ simplified to a fraction is $\\boxed{\\frac{25}{16}}$. \n",
        "**1. Simplify the numerator:**\n*  The numerator is a sum of fractions with the same denominator.  \n*  Add the numerators and keep the denominator: (3 + 7)/8 = 10/8\n**2. Simplify the fraction in the numerator:**\n*  The fraction 10/8 can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 2. \n*  This gives us 10/8 = 5/4\n**3. Divide the numerator by the denominator:**\n*  Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal of that fraction.\n*  The reciprocal of 4/5 is 5/4.\n**4.
