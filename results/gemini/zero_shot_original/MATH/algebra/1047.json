        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Simplify the Right Side:**\nThe right side of the equation can be simplified:\n  *  $\\frac{8}{3\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{8}{3\\sqrt{2}} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{8\\sqrt{2}}{6} = \\frac{4\\sqrt{2}}{3}$\n**2. Match the Radicals:**\nNow our equation looks like this: \n  * $\\frac{A\\sqrt{B}}{C} = \\frac{4\\sqrt{2}}{3}$\nSince the radicals on both sides must be equal, we know  $B = 2$.\n**3.  Consider the Prime Factors:**\n* We're given that $A$ and $C$ have no common prime factors.  This means the prime factors of 4 must be entirely in $A$ and the prime factors of 3 must be entirely in $C$.\n* We know $B = 2$ and it has no perfect square factors other than 1. This means $B$ is a prime number.\n**4. Find the Values:**\nSince $A$ has no common prime factors with $C$, we can deduce:\n* $A = 4$ (to match the numerator on the right side)\n* $C = 3$ (to match the denominator on the right side)\n**5. Calculate the Sum:**\nFinally, we find the sum:\n* $A + B + C = 4 + 2 + 3 = \\boxed{9}$ \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Simplify the right side of the equation:**\n   *  The right side of the equation is $\\frac{8}{3\\sqrt{2}}$. We can simplify this by multiplying the numerator and denominator by $\\sqrt{2}$:\n     $$\\frac{8}{3\\sqrt{2}} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{8\\sqrt{2}}{6} = \\frac{4\\sqrt{2}}{3}$$\n**2.  Rationalize the denominator on the left side:**\n   *  To make the comparison easier, let's rationalize the denominator on the left side:\n     $$\\frac{A\\sqrt{B}}{C} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{B}}{\\sqrt{B}} = \\frac{A\\cdot B}{C\\sqrt{B}}$$\n**3.  Set the two sides equal and simplify:**\n   *  Now we have: \n      $$\\frac{A\\cdot B}{C\\sqrt{B}} = \\frac{4\\sqrt{2}}{3}$$\n   *  Since the denominators must be equal,  $C\\sqrt{B} = 3\\sqrt{2}$. This tells us that $C=3$ and $B=2$ (since $B$ has no perfect square factors other than 1).\n**4.  Solve for A:**\n   *  Substitute $B=2$ and $C=3$ back into the original equation:\n     $$\\frac{A\\sqrt{2}}{3} = \\frac{4\\sqrt{2}}{3}$$\n   *  Therefore, $A = 4$.\n**5.  Calculate A + B + C:**\n   *  Finally, $A + B + C = 4 + 2 + 3 = \\boxed{9}$. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Simplify the right side of the equation:**\n*  The right side of the equation can be simplified: \n   \n   ```\n   (8 / (3\u221a2)) * (\u221a2 / \u221a2) = (8\u221a2) / (3 * 2) = (4\u221a2) / 3\n   ```\n**2. Match the radicals:**\n* We now have:  (A\u221aB) / C = (4\u221a2) / 3\n* Since B has no perfect square factors other than 1, and 2 is a prime number, we know that B must be equal to 2.
