        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Set up equations:**\n* Let 'x' represent the larger number.\n* Let 'y' represent the smaller number.\nWe are given:\n* x + y = 40 \n* x - y = 12\n**2. Solve for x and y:**\n* **Add the two equations together:** Notice that the 'y' terms cancel out.\n   (x + y) + (x - y) = 40 + 12\n   2x = 52\n* **Solve for x:** Divide both sides by 2.\n   x = 26\n* **Substitute the value of x back into either original equation to solve for y:** Let's use x + y = 40\n   26 + y = 40\n* **Solve for y:** Subtract 26 from both sides.\n   y = 14\n**3. Calculate the product:**\n* Now that we know x = 26 and y = 14, we can find their product:\n   x * y = 26 * 14 = 364\n**Therefore, the product of the two numbers is 364.** \n",
