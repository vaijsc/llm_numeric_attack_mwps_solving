    "problem": "In a recent wedding, the groom's age was fifteen years more than half the bride's age. If the sum of their ages was 51 years, how old was the groom?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let the groom's age be $g$ and the bride's age be $b$. We are trying to find the value of $g$. We can write a system of two equations to represent the given information. Here are our two equations: \\begin{align*}\ng &= \\frac{1}{2}b + 15 \\\\\ng + b &= 51.\n\\end{align*} The first equation represents the statement ``the groom's age was fifteen years more than half the bride's age.'' The second equation represents the statement ``if the sum of their ages was 51 years...'' We are solving for $g$, so we want to eliminate $b$. From the second equation, we get that $b=51-g$. Substituting that into the first equation to get rid of $b$, we have $g=\\frac{1}{2}(51-g)+15$, from which we get that $g=27$. Thus, the groom's age is $\\boxed{27}$ years old.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**Let's use variables:**\n* Let  'b' represent the bride's age.\n* Let 'g' represent the groom's age.\n**Set up equations based on the given information:**\n* **Equation 1:**  \"The groom's age was fifteen years more than half the bride's age.\"  This translates to:  g = (b/2) + 15\n* **Equation 2:** \"The sum of their ages was 51 years.\"  This translates to: g + b = 51\n**Now we have a system of two equations. We can solve for our unknowns:**\n1. **Solve for 'g' in Equation 2:** \n   g = 51 - b\n2. **Substitute the value of 'g' from step 1 into Equation 1:**\n   (51 - b) = (b/2) + 15\n3. **Solve for 'b':**\n   * 51 - b = (b/2) + 15\n   * 36 = (3b/2) \n   * 72 = 3b\n   * b = 24\n4. **Now that we know the bride's age (b = 24), substitute it back into either Equation 1 or Equation 2 to find the groom's age (g). Let's use Equation 2:**\n   * g + 24 = 51\n   * g = 27\n**Therefore, the groom was 27 years old.** \n",
