    "solution": "If $x^2+cx+9c$ is the square of a binomial, then because the coefficient of $x^2$ is $1$, the binomial must be of the form $x+a$ for some $a$. So, we have $$(x+a)^2 = x^2+cx+9c.$$Expanding the left side, we have $$x^2 + 2ax + a^2 = x^2 + cx + 9c.$$The coefficients of $x$ must agree, so $2a=c$. Also, the constant terms must agree, so $a^2=9c$, giving $c=\\frac{a^2}{9}$. We have two expressions for $c$ in terms of $a$, so we set them equal to each other: $$2a = \\frac{a^2}{9}.$$To solve for $a$, we subtract $2a$ from both sides: $$0 = \\frac{a^2}{9} - 2a$$and then factor: $$0 = a\\left(\\frac{a}{9}-2\\right),$$which has solutions $a=0$ and $a=18$.\n\nFinally, we have $c=2a$, so $c=0$ or $c=36$. But we are looking for a nonzero answer, so we can reject $c=0$. We obtain $c=\\boxed{36}$.\n\n(Checking, we find that $x^2+36x+9\\cdot 36$ is indeed equal to $(x+18)^2$.)",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Problem**\nWe're given a quadratic expression,  x\u00b2 + cx + 9c, and we want to find the value of 'c' that makes it a perfect square trinomial.  This means the expression can be factored into the form (x + a)\u00b2 or (x - a)\u00b2, where 'a' is some constant.\n**2.  Recall the Pattern for Squaring a Binomial**\n(x + a)\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + 2ax + a\u00b2 \n(x - a)\u00b2 = x\u00b2 - 2ax + a\u00b2\n**3.  Apply the Pattern to Our Expression**\nWe need to find a constant 'a' such that the coefficient of the x term (2ax) is equal to 'c' and the constant term (a\u00b2) is equal to 9c.\n* **Matching the x term:** 2ax = c\n* **Matching the constant term:** a\u00b2 = 9c\n**4.  Solve for 'c'**\nLet's work with the second equation (a\u00b2 = 9c).  We can solve for 'c' to get:\nc = a\u00b2/9\nNow, substitute this value of 'c' into the first equation (2ax = c):\n2ax = a\u00b2/9\nSimplify by multiplying both sides by 9 and dividing both sides by 'a' (since 'a' cannot be zero):\n18x = a\n**5.  Connect the Coefficients**\nWe have a = 18x. Now substitute this back into our equation for 'c':\nc = (18x)\u00b2 / 9 \nc = 324x\u00b2 / 9\nc = 36x\u00b2\n**6.  The Answer**\nSince 'c' is a constant, it cannot depend on 'x'. This means the only way for  c to be a constant is if x = 1. Therefore:\nc = 36(1)\u00b2 = **36** \n**Therefore, the value of c that makes the expression a perfect square trinomial is 36.** \n",

Substituting our value for 'a' gives us 2(3\u221ac)x = cx.\n3. **Solving for 'c':** Simplifying the equation, we get 6\u221ac x = cx.  For this to hold true for all values of x, we must have 6\u221ac = c.\n4. **Squaring both sides:** Squaring both sides of the equation gives us 36c = c\u00b2.\n5. **Rearranging:** This simplifies to c\u00b2 - 36c = 0.\n6. **Factoring:** Factoring out a 'c', we have c(c - 36) = 0.\n7. **Solution:** Therefore, c = 0 or c = 36. Since the problem states that c is nonzero, the answer is **c = 36**.\n**Verification**\nLet's check if our answer works:\n*  x\u00b2 + 36x + 9(36) = x\u00b2 + 36x + 324\n*  This factors into (x + 18)\u00b2 \n**Therefore, the value of c is 36.** \n",
