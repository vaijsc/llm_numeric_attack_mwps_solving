        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n1. **Find g(16):**  Since  g(x) = \u221ax, we have g(16) = \u221a16 = 4.\n2. **Find t(g(16)), which is t(4):** Now we know that t(x) = 3 - g(x). Substitute x = 4: \n   t(4) = 3 - g(4) \n3. **Find g(4):** We know g(x) = \u221ax, so g(4) = \u221a4 = 2.\n4. **Calculate t(4):** Substitute g(4) = 2 into the equation for t(4):\n   t(4) = 3 - 2 = 1\n**Therefore, t(g(16)) = 1** \n",
