Use the given points to create a system of equations.**\nSince the parabola passes through the points (0, 5), (1, 10), and (2, 19), we can substitute these coordinates into the equation y = ax\u00b2 + bx + c to get three equations:\n* **Point (0, 5):**  5 = a(0)\u00b2 + b(0) + c  =>  c = 5\n* **Point (1, 10):** 10 = a(1)\u00b2 + b(1) + c  =>  a + b + c = 10\n* **Point (2, 19):** 19 = a(2)\u00b2 + b(2) + c  =>  4a + 2b + c = 19\n**2.

Calculate a + b + c**\nNow that we know a = 2, b = 3, and c = 5, we can calculate a + b + c:\n* a + b + c = 2 + 3 + 5 = **10**\n**Therefore, a + b + c = 10** \n",
