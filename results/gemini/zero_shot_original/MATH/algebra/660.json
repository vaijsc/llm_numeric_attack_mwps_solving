    "solution": "We are asked to sum the integer solutions of the inequality  \\[\n\\frac{1}{3}<\\frac{3}{x}<\\frac{3}{4}.\n\\] If both sides of an inequality represent positive numbers, then we may take the reciprocal of both sides of the inequality and reverse the inequality sign. We can do that in this case, because all solutions of the original inequalities are clearly positive. Reciprocating all three quantities in this compound inequality, we get \\[\n3>\\frac{x}{3}>\\frac{4}{3}.\n\\] Now multiply both sides by $3$ to find that $4<x<9$.  The sum of the integer values of $x$ which satisfy this inequality is $5+6+7+8=\\boxed{26}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Set up the inequalities:**\nWe are given the following inequalities:\n*  $\\frac{3}{x} > \\frac{1}{3}$\n*  $\\frac{3}{x} < \\frac{3}{4}$\n**2. Solve for x in each inequality:**\n* **First inequality:**\n    * Multiply both sides by 3x (remembering to flip the inequality sign since we're multiplying by a negative if x is negative): \n       * $9 > x$ \n    *  Rewrite:\n       * $x < 9$\n* **Second inequality:**\n    * Multiply both sides by 4x:\n       * $12 > 3x$\n    * Divide both sides by 3:\n       * $4 > x$\n    * Rewrite:\n       * $x < 4$\n**3. Combine the inequalities:**\nWe have two inequalities: \n   * $x < 9$\n   * $x < 4$\nThe solution must satisfy *both* inequalities. Since all numbers less than 4 are also less than 9, the combined solution is:\n   * $x < 4$\n**4. Find the integers that satisfy the solution:**\nThe integers less than 4 are:\n   *  ... -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3\n**5. Calculate the sum:**\nSum the integers:\n   * -3 + (-2) + (-1) + 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 = **0**\n**Therefore, the sum of all integer values of x is 0.** \n",

Consider negative values of x:**\nSince we multiplied by $x$ in our inequalities, we need to consider what happens if $x$ is negative.  If $x$ is negative, the inequalities will flip:\n* **For the first inequality:**\n   - Multiplying by $3x$ would give us: $9 < x$ \n* **For the second inequality:**\n   - Multiplying by $4x$ would give us: $12 > 3x$, which simplifies to $4 > x$.\nThis means there are no negative values of $x$ that satisfy the original inequalities.\n**5.
