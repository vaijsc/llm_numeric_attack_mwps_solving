    "solution": "Let $C$ be the cost of carpeting a floor and $A$ be the area.  By the definition of a direct proportion, we know that $C=kA$, where $k$ is a constant.  Substituting $105$ for $C$ and $14\\times 5=70$ for $A$, we can find that $k=3/2$.  Then, the cost to carpet a floor that is $16\\times13$ square feet will be: \\begin{align*}\nC&=kA\\\\\n&=(3/2)(16\\times13)\\\\\n&=\\boxed{312 \\text{ dollars}}.\n\\end{align*}",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the cost per square foot:**\n* The first floor is $14 \\times 5 = 70$ square feet.\n* The cost per square foot is $105 / 70 = \\$1.50$.\n**2. Calculate the area of the second floor:**\n* The second floor is $16 \\times 13 = 208$ square feet.\n**3. Calculate the total cost:**\n* The cost to carpet the second floor is $208 \\times \\$1.50 = \\$312$.\n**Answer:** It will cost **$312** to carpet the second floor. \n",
