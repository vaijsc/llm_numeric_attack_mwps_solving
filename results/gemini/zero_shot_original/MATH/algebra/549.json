        "Here's how we can solve this step-by-step:\n**1. Start with the given information:**\n* We know  *f(14) = 7*. \n* We also know the rules for defining *f(b)* based on whether *b* is odd or even.\n**2.  Apply the rules to find more values of *f(x)*:**\n* Since 7 is odd,  *f(7) = 3(7) + 1 = 22*.\n* Since 22 is even, *f(22) = 22/2 = 11*.\n* Since 11 is odd, *f(11) = 3(11) + 1 = 34*.\n* Since 34 is even, *f(34) = 34/2 = 17*.\n* Since 17 is odd, *f(17) = 3(17) + 1 = 52*. \n* Since 52 is even, *f(52) = 52/2 = 26*.\n* Since 26 is even, *f(26) = 26/2 = 13*.\n* Since 13 is odd, *f(13) = 3(13) + 1 = 40*.\n* Since 40 is even, *f(40) = 40/2 = 20*.\n* Since 20 is even, *f(20) = 20/2 = 10*.\n* Since 10 is even, *f(10) = 10/2 = 5*.\n* Since 5 is odd, *f(5) = 3(5) + 1 = 16*.\n* Since 16 is even, *f(16) = 16/2 = 8*.\n* Since 8 is even, *f(8) = 8/2 = 4*.\n* Since 4 is even, *f(4) = 4/2 = 2*.\n* Since 2 is even, *f(2) = 2/2 = 1*.\n* Since 1 is odd, *f(1) = 3(1) + 1 = 4*.\n**3.  Notice a pattern:**\nWe've found that the function keeps looping back on itself.  Once we get to 1, the function values repeat.  \n**4.  Conclusion:**\nThe smallest possible number of integers in the domain of *f(x)* is **14**.  We have found that the values of *f(x)* repeat after we reach 1.  Therefore, any further applications of the rules won't generate new integers in the domain. \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Start with the given information:**\n* We know  *f(14) = 7*.  Since 14 is even, this means *f(7) = 14/2 = 7*. \n**2. Explore the consequences:**\n* We now know *f(7) = 7*.  Since 7 is odd, this means *f(7) = (3 * 7) + 1 = 22*. \n* Continuing, since 22 is even, *f(22) = 22 / 2 = 11*. \n* Since 11 is odd, *f(11) = (3 * 11) + 1 = 34*.\n* Since 34 is even, *f(34) = 34 / 2 = 17*.\n* Since 17 is odd, *f(17) = (3 * 17) + 1 = 52*. \n* And so on...\n**3.  Notice the pattern:**\nThis process will keep generating new integers in the domain of *f*. Notice that we're repeatedly applying the rules:\n    * If the current value is odd, we multiply by 3 and add 1.\n    * If the current value is even, we divide by 2.\n**4.  The Key Insight:**\nThe key is to realize that this process will eventually lead back to a number we've already encountered. This is because:\n* If we keep dividing even numbers by 2, we'll eventually get down to 1.\n* Once we get to 1, the odd rule will make us jump to 4, and then the even rule will bring us back to 2.  From there, we'll cycle between 2 and 1.\n**5.  Finding the Cycle:**\nTo find the smallest set of integers in the domain, we need to figure out which numbers are involved in this cycle. Let's trace back from 14:\n* 14 -> 7 -> 22 -> 11 -> 34 -> 17 -> 52 -> 26 -> 13 -> 40 -> 20 -> 10 -> 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1\n**6.  The Answer:**\nThe smallest possible set of integers in the domain of *f* includes all the numbers we encountered in the cycle above:\n{1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 20, 22, 26, 34, 40, 52}\nTherefore, the smallest possible number of integers in the domain of *f* is **18**. \n",
