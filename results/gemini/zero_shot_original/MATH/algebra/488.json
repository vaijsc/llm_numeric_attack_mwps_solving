        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Recognize the Pattern**\nThe expression inside the square root keeps repeating:  \n*  \u221a(x * \u221a(x * \u221a(x * \u221a(x...))))\nThis is an infinite nested radical.\n**2.  Let y = the Infinite Radical**\nTo make the problem easier to work with, let's assign a variable:\n*  y = \u221a(x * \u221a(x * \u221a(x * \u221a(x...))))\n**3. Substitute**\nSince the expression inside the radical is the same as the original 'y', we can substitute:\n* y = \u221a(x * y)\n**4. Solve for y**\n* Square both sides: y\u00b2 = x * y\n* Subtract y\u00b2 from both sides: 0 = xy - y\u00b2\n* Factor out a y: 0 = y(x - y)\n* Since we know the radical is equal to 3 (y = 3), we can focus on the other factor: x - y = 0\n**5. Solve for x**\n* Substitute y = 3 back into the equation: x - 3 = 0\n* Add 3 to both sides: x = 3\n**Therefore, x = 3** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding the Pattern**\nThe expression inside the square roots continues infinitely. This means we can represent the entire expression as a single variable:\nLet  $y = \\sqrt{x\\cdot\\!\\sqrt{x\\cdot\\!\\sqrt{x\\cdot\\!\\sqrt{x\\cdots}}}}$\n**Simplifying the Expression**\nNotice that the expression inside the first square root is the same as the entire expression itself:\n* $y = \\sqrt{x \\cdot y}$ \n**Solving for x**\n1. **Square both sides:**  \n   $y^2 = x \\cdot y$\n2. **Rearrange the equation:**\n   $y^2 - xy = 0$\n3. **Factor out y:**\n   $y(y - x) = 0$\n4. **Solve for y:** \n   *  $y = 0$  or  * $y = x$\n5. **Since the original expression is a square root, it cannot be zero.** Therefore,  $y = x$.\n6. **Substitute back the original value of y:**\n    * $x = \\sqrt{x\\cdot\\!\\sqrt{x\\cdot\\!\\sqrt{x\\cdot\\!\\sqrt{x\\cdots}}}}$\n7. **We know this expression equals 3:**\n    * $x = 3$\n**Therefore, x = 3** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.

Substitute to simplify**\nNotice that the expression inside the square root is also equal to 'y':\n   * y = \u221a(x * y)\n**4.

Consider the context**\nSince the original expression is a square root, it cannot be equal to 0. Therefore, y = x is the only valid solution.\n**6.  Solve for x**\nWe know:\n   * y = \u221a(x * y) \n   * y = x \nSubstitute y = x into the first equation:\n   * x = \u221a(x * x)\n   * x = \u221a(x\u00b2)\n   * x = x \nThis equation is true for any value of x.  However, we are given that the entire expression equals 3:\n* \u221a(x * \u221a(x * \u221a(x * \u221a(x...)))) = 3\n* y = 3 \n* x = 3  (since y = x)\n**Therefore, x = 3** \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understanding the Pattern:**\nThe expression represents an infinite nested radical.
