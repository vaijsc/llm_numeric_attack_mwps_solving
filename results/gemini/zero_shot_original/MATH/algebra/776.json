        "1. **Substitute the value of y:** Since we are given that y = 3, we replace all instances of 'y' in the expression with '3'. \n   This gives us: (1 + 3)^3\n2. **Simplify inside the parentheses:** 1 + 3 = 4, so the expression becomes: 4^3\n3. **Evaluate the exponent:** 4^3 means 4 multiplied by itself three times: 4 * 4 * 4 = 64\nTherefore, (1 + y)^y = **64** when y = 3. \n",
