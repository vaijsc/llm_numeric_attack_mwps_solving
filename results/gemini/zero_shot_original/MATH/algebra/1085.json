        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Pattern**\n* The first few odd numbers are: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9...\n* Notice that each odd number is 2 more than the previous one.\n**2. Formula for the Sum of an Arithmetic Series**\nThe sum (S) of an arithmetic series is given by:\nS = (n/2) * [2a + (n-1)d]\nwhere:\n* n = number of terms\n* a = first term\n* d = common difference\n**3. Apply the Formula to Our Problem**\n* In this case, the first term (a) is 1, the common difference (d) is 2, and the sum (S) is 121.  We want to find the number of terms (n). \n* Substitute these values into the formula:\n   121 = (n/2) * [2(1) + (n-1)2]\n**4. Simplify and Solve for 'n'**\n* 121 = (n/2) * (2 + 2n - 2)\n* 121 = (n/2) * (2n)\n* 121 = n\u00b2\n* n = \u221a121\n* n = 11\n**Therefore, the value of N is 11.** \n",

Understand the Pattern:**\n* The first few odd numbers are 1, 3, 5, 7, ...\n* Notice that each odd number is 2 more than the previous one.\n**2.  The Formula:**\n* The sum of an arithmetic series (like the odd numbers) is:  (first term + last term) * (number of terms) / 2\n**3.  Applying the Formula:**\n*  Let 'N' be the number of odd numbers.\n*  The first odd number is 1.\n*  The last odd number is 2N - 1 (since each odd number is 2 more than the previous one).\nSo, the sum of the first N odd numbers can be expressed as:\n(1 + (2N - 1)) * N / 2 = 121\n**4.  Simplifying the Equation:**\n* (2N) * N / 2 = 121\n* N\u00b2 = 121\n**5.  Solving for N:**\n* N = \u221a121\n* N = 11\n**Therefore, the value of N is 11.** \n",
