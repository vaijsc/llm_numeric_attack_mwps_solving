Understand the Domain and Range**\n* **Domain:** The domain of a function is the set of all possible input values (in this case, the values of 'n').  The domain of  \u2113(n) is the integers from 0 to 20, inclusive. This means there are 21 numbers in the domain.\n* **Range:** The range of a function is the set of all possible output values (the values of \u2113(n)). We need to figure out what those output values are.\n**2. Determine the Range**\nLet's list the number of letters in the English spellings of the numbers 0 to 20:\n* 0:  \"zero\" - 4 letters\n* 1: \"one\" - 3 letters\n* 2: \"two\" - 3 letters\n* 3: \"three\" - 5 letters\n* 4: \"four\" - 4 letters\n* 5: \"five\" - 4 letters\n* 6: \"six\" - 3 letters\n* 7: \"seven\" - 5 letters\n* 8: \"eight\" - 5 letters\n* 9: \"nine\" - 4 letters\n* 10: \"ten\" - 3 letters\n* 11: \"eleven\" - 6 letters\n* 12: \"twelve\" - 6 letters\n* 13: \"thirteen\" - 8 letters\n* 14: \"fourteen\" - 8 letters\n* 15: \"fifteen\" - 7 letters\n* 16: \"sixteen\" - 7 letters\n* 17: \"seventeen\" - 9 letters\n* 18: \"eighteen\" - 8 letters\n* 19: \"nineteen\" - 8 letters\n* 20: \"twenty\" - 6 letters\nThe range of \u2113(n) is the set of all the numbers of letters we found: {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. There are 7 distinct numbers in the range.\n**3. Find the Difference**\nWe want to find the numbers in the domain that are *not* in the range.  \n* Domain: 21 numbers\n* Range: 7 numbers\nTherefore, there are **21 - 7 = 14** numbers in the domain of \u2113(n) that are not in the range. \n",
