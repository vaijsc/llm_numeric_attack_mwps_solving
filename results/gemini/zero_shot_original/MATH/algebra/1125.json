In other words, for all x in the domain:\n*  f(f(x)) = x\n**2. Analyzing the Pieces**\n* **For x \u2264 2:** The function is defined as  `2 + (x - 2)^2`.  Let's call this part `g(x)`.\n* **For x > 2:** The function is defined as `k(x)`.\n**3. Applying the Inverse Condition**\nWe need to consider two cases:\n* **Case 1: x \u2264 2:** \n   -  Since `f(x) = g(x)` for x \u2264 2, we want `f(g(x)) = x` for x \u2264 2. \n   - This means  `g(g(x)) = x` for x \u2264 2. (Because `f(x) = g(x)` when x \u2264 2)\n* **Case 2: x > 2:**\n   - Since `f(x) = k(x)` for x > 2, we want `f(k(x)) = x` for x > 2.\n   - This means `g(k(x)) = x` for x > 2. (Because `f(x) = g(x)` when x \u2264 2)\n**4. Solving for k(x)**\nLet's focus on Case 2, since it involves `k(x)`:\n-  `g(k(x)) = x` for x > 2\n-  Substitute `g(x) = 2 + (x - 2)^2`: `2 + (k(x) - 2)^2 = x` for x > 2\nNow, solve for `k(x)`:\n1. Subtract 2 from both sides: `(k(x) - 2)^2 = x - 2`\n2. Take the square root of both sides: `k(x) - 2 = \u221a(x - 2)` (Note: we take the positive square root because `k(x)` needs to be greater than 2)\n3. Add 2 to both sides: `k(x) = 2 + \u221a(x - 2)`\n**Therefore, the function k(x) that makes f its own inverse is:**\n\\[k(x) = 2 + \\sqrt{x - 2}\\] \n",

Analyzing the Function**\nWe have a piecewise function:\n*  For x > 2:  f(x) = k(x)\n*  For x \u2264 2:  f(x) = 2 + (x - 2)\u00b2\nLet's consider the two cases separately:\n**Case 1: x > 2**\n* Since f(x) = k(x) for x > 2, applying f again means we need to find k(k(x)). We want this to equal x. \n**Case 2: x \u2264 2**\n* For x \u2264 2, f(x) = 2 + (x - 2)\u00b2.  To find f(f(x)), we need to consider what happens when we input this expression back into f.  There are two possibilities:\n    * If 2 + (x - 2)\u00b2 > 2 (which means x \u2260 2), then we are in the case where f(x) = k(x), and we need to find k(2 + (x - 2)\u00b2).\n    * If 2 + (x - 2)\u00b2 \u2264 2 (which means x = 2), then we are in the case where f(x) = 2 + (x - 2)\u00b2, and we need to find 2 + ((2 + (x - 2)\u00b2) - 2)\u00b2.\n**3. Finding k(x)**\n* **Let's focus on Case 1 (x > 2):** We know we need k(k(x)) = x. This suggests that k(x) is the inverse of itself. The only function that satisfies this is the identity function: k(x) = x.  However, this doesn't work for Case 2. \n* **Let's examine Case 2 (x \u2264 2):**  We need to find k(2 + (x - 2)\u00b2).  We know that for x \u2264 2, the output of f is always greater than or equal to 2. This means the input to k(x) will always be greater than 2.  Therefore, we need k(x) to be defined for x > 2.  Since we know k(x) needs to be an inverse function, it makes sense to try k(x) = x.\n**4. Checking for Consistency**\nLet's check if our solution works for both cases:\n* **Case 1 (x > 2):**  f(f(x)) = k(k(x)) = x  (This holds since k(x) = x)\n* **Case 2 (x \u2264 2):** \n    * If 2 + (x - 2)\u00b2 > 2:  f(f(x)) = k(2 + (x - 2)\u00b2) = 2 + (x - 2)\u00b2 = x.\n    * If 2 + (x - 2)\u00b2 \u2264 2 (x = 2): f(f(x)) = 2 + ((2 + (x - 2)\u00b2) - 2)\u00b2 = 2 = x.\n**Conclusion**\nThe function k(x) that makes f(x) its own inverse is:\n```\nk(x) = x  (for x > 2)\n``` \n",
        "Here's how to find the function k(x) and understand why it makes f(x) its own inverse:\n**Understanding Inverse Functions**\n* **Definition:** A function is its own inverse if applying the function twice brings you back to the original input.  In other words,  *f(f(x)) = x* for all x in the domain.\n* **Key Property:** The graph of a function and its inverse are reflections of each other across the line y = x.\n**Step-by-Step Solution**\n1. **Focus on the piecewise definition:**  We need to consider two cases:\n   * **Case 1: x > 2:** In this case, f(x) = k(x).  To find the inverse, we need to solve for x in terms of y: \n      *  y = k(x) \n      *  x = k\u207b\u00b9(y)  (where k\u207b\u00b9(y) represents the inverse function of k(x))\n   * **Case 2: x \u2264 2:**  Here, f(x) = 2 + (x - 2)\u00b2. To find the inverse, we follow similar steps:\n      * y = 2 + (x - 2)\u00b2\n      * y - 2 = (x - 2)\u00b2\n      * \u00b1\u221a(y - 2) = x - 2\n      * x = 2 \u00b1 \u221a(y - 2)\n2. **Apply the inverse function property:** Since we want f to be its own inverse, f(f(x)) = x.

This means k(x) must be the inverse of itself. \n   * **Case 2 (x \u2264 2):**\n      * f(f(x)) = f(2 + (x - 2)\u00b2) = 2 + ( (2 + (x - 2)\u00b2) - 2)\u00b2 \n      * Simplifying, we get f(f(x)) = 2 + (x - 2)\u2074\n      * For f to be its own inverse, 2 + (x - 2)\u2074 must equal x.\n3. **Solve for k(x):** \n   * We need to find a function k(x) such that k(k(x)) = x and that satisfies the condition from Case 2.  \n   * **Observation:** The function k(x) = 1/x would work if we were dealing with the entire real line. However, since we're restricted to x > 2, we need a function that \"shifts\" the reciprocal function to the right and up.\n   * **Solution:**  We can achieve this by shifting the reciprocal function to the right by 2 and up by 2:\n      * **k(x) = 2 + 1/(x - 2)**\n4. **Verify:** Let's check if our solution works:\n   * **Case 1 (x > 2):** \n      * k(k(x)) = k(2 + 1/(x - 2)) = 2 + 1/( (2 + 1/(x - 2)) - 2) = 2 + (x - 2) = x\n   * **Case 2 (x \u2264 2):**\n      * We already showed that f(f(x)) = 2 + (x - 2)\u2074, which does not equal x.\n5. **Conclusion:**  Since we cannot find a function k(x) that satisfies both conditions, **there is no function k(x) that makes f(x) its own inverse.**\n**Key Takeaway:** Even though we found a function k(x) that satisfies the property for x > 2, it doesn't work for x \u2264 2, meaning the overall function f(x) cannot be its own inverse. \n",

Solve for k(x):**\n* **Case 1:**  We need to solve k(k(x)) = x for k(x). There's no easy way to solve this directly.  Instead, let's try a clever substitution: \n    *  Let y = k(x).  Then k(y) = x. \n    *  Now we have a simpler equation: k(y) = x. Since k(x) is the inverse of itself, this implies y = k(x) = x.
