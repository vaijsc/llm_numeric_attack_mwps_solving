    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Rearranging the first equation, we have that $a=\\frac{27}{5b^2}$. If we substitute this into the original equation, we get $\\frac{729}{25b^4}b=135$; multiplying each side by $\\frac{b^3}{135}$ yields $b^3=\\frac{27}{125}$. Taking the cube root, we see that $b=\\frac{3}{5}$. Substituting $b$ into the first equation, we get that $\\frac{9}{25}a=\\frac{27}{5}$ or $a=15$. Thus, $a+5b=15+3=\\boxed{18}$.",
