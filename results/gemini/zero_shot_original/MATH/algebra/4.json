        "Here's how to solve for *x*:\n1. **Rewrite 4 as a power of 2:**  Since 4 is the same as 2 squared (2\u00b2), we can rewrite the equation as: 2\u2078 = (2\u00b2)\u02e3\n2. **Simplify the exponent:**  When raising a power to another power, you multiply the exponents. So, (2\u00b2)\u02e3 = 2\u00b2\u02e3\n3. **Equate the exponents:** Now we have 2\u2078 = 2\u00b2\u02e3. Since the bases are the same, the exponents must be equal.  This gives us: 8 = 2*x\n4. **Solve for x:**  Divide both sides by 2 to isolate *x*: x = 8/2 = 4\n**Therefore, the value of x is 4.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve for *x*:\n1. **Rewrite the base:** Notice that 4 can be expressed as 2 squared (4 = 2\u00b2). \n2. **Substitute:** Substitute 2\u00b2 for 4 in the equation: 2\u2078 = (2\u00b2)\u02e3\n3. **Simplify:** Using the power of a power rule [(a^m)^n = a^(m*n)], we get: 2\u2078 = 2^(2x)\n4. **Solve for x:**  Since the bases are the same, we can equate the exponents: 8 = 2x\n5. **Isolate x:** Divide both sides by 2: x = 4\n**Therefore, the value of x is 4.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n1. **Rewrite 4 as a power of 2:**  Since 4 is the same as 2 squared (2\u00b2), we can substitute that into the equation: \n   * 2\u2078 = (2\u00b2)\u02e3\n2. **Simplify using exponent rules:** When raising a power to another power, we multiply the exponents:\n   * 2\u2078 = 2\u00b2\u02e3\n3. **Equate the exponents:** Now that both sides have the same base (2), we can set the exponents equal to each other:\n   * 8 = 2x\n4. **Solve for x:** Divide both sides by 2:\n   * x = 4\n**Therefore, the value of x is 4.** \n",
