        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n* **Convert horsepower to kilowatts:** Since 1 kilowatt is equivalent to 1.36 horsepower, we can divide the horsepower by 1.36 to find the equivalent kilowatts.\n* **Calculation:** 500 horsepower / 1.36 horsepower/kilowatt \u2248 367.65 kilowatts\n* **Round to the nearest kilowatt:**  367.65 kilowatts rounds up to **368 kilowatts**.\n**Therefore, Eric's car engine can generate approximately 368 kilowatts of power.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n* **Understand the conversion:** We know that 1 kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1.36 horsepower (hp).\n* **Set up the proportion:** We want to find out how many kilowatts are in 500 horsepower.  This can be set up as a proportion:  \n   *  1 kW / 1.36 hp = x kW / 500 hp\n* **Solve for x:** To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:\n   * 1 kW * 500 hp = 1.36 hp * x kW\n   * 500 kW * hp = 1.36 hp * x kW\n* **Isolate x:** Divide both sides of the equation by 1.36 hp:\n   * 500 kW * hp / 1.36 hp = x kW\n   * x \u2248 367.65 kW\n**Answer:** Eric's car's engine can generate approximately **368 kilowatts** of power. \n",
