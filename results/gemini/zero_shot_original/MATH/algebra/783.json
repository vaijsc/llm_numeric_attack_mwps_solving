    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since $\\frac37$ is less than 1, the function will always decrease as $x$ increases when $x\\ge0$. So, the largest value in the range will occur when at the smallest value of $x$: $x=0$, giving us the upper bound of $\\left(\\frac{3}{7}\\right)^0=1$. As the value of $x$ increases, the value of $y$ will gradually decrease, approaching (but never reaching) the lower bound of 0. Therefore, the range of this function when $x\\ge0$ is $\\boxed{(0,1]}$",

This means the function can take on any value greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1. \n",

The base, 3/7, is a fraction between 0 and 1.\n* **Behavior:** When the base of an exponential function is between 0 and 1, the function decreases as x increases.\n**Finding the Range**\n1. **As x approaches infinity:**  As *x* gets larger and larger (approaching infinity), the value of  $\\left(\\frac{3}{7}\\right)^x$ gets closer and closer to 0.  This is because a fraction between 0 and 1 raised to a large power becomes very small.\n2. **At x = 0:**  When *x* is 0, we have  $f(0) = \\left(\\frac{3}{7}\\right)^0 = 1$.\n3. **Putting it together:** Since the function is decreasing and approaches 0 as *x* increases, and the maximum value is 1 (at x = 0), the range of the function is **(0, 1]**.\n**In conclusion, the range of the function  $f(x) = \\left(\\frac{3}{7}\\right)^x$ on the domain [0, \u221e) is (0, 1].** \n",

Analyze the behavior as x increases:**\n* As *x* increases, the value of (3/7)^*x* gets smaller and smaller.  \n* Think about it: (3/7)^1 is less than (3/7)^0, and (3/7)^2 is even smaller than (3/7)^1.\n**3. Determine the upper and lower bounds:**\n* **Upper Bound:** When *x* = 0,  (3/7)^0 = 1.  So, the function has a maximum value of 1.\n* **Lower Bound:** As *x* approaches infinity, (3/7)^*x* approaches 0 but never actually reaches it.  \n**4. Express the range:**\nThe range of the function is all the possible output values.
