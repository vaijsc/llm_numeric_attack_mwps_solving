        "Here's how to solve this problem step by step:\n**1. Set up equations:**\n* Let 'x' be the larger number.\n* Let 'y' be the smaller number.\nWe are given:\n*  x + y = 25 \n*  x - y = 9\n**2. Solve for one variable:**\nWe can solve for 'x' in the second equation:\n* x = y + 9\n**3. Substitute:**\nSubstitute this value of 'x' into the first equation:\n* (y + 9) + y = 25\n**4. Simplify and solve for 'y':**\n* 2y + 9 = 25\n* 2y = 16\n* y = 8\n**5. Solve for x:**\nSubstitute the value of 'y' back into either of the original equations. Let's use x + y = 25:\n* x + 8 = 25\n* x = 17\n**6. Calculate the product:**\n* The product of the two numbers is x * y = 17 * 8 = 136\n**Therefore, the product of the two numbers is 136.** \n",
