We know that $s$ is an integer, so in order for the sum to be an integer, we must have that $\\sqrt{s^2+1}$ is an integer.\n\nLet $\\sqrt{s^2+1}=n$ for some integer $n$. Then we have $s^2+1=n^2$, or $n^2-s^2=1$ and thus $$(n-s)(n+s)=1.$$ Since $n$ and $s$ are both integers, then their sum and difference must also both be integers, so they are either both $1$ or both $-1$ since their product is 1. In either case, $n-s=n+s$, so $2s=0$ and $s=0$. This is the only value of $s$ for which $\\sqrt{s^2+1}$ is an integer, and thus the only value of $s$ that makes the roots of the given quadratic integers, so $s=\\boxed{0}$.",

Understand the Relationship Between Roots and Coefficients**\n* For a quadratic equation of the form  *ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0*, the sum of the roots is given by  -b/a.\n* In our case, the quadratic expression is (1/2)x\u00b2 + sx - (1/2). \n**2.

        "Here's how we can solve this problem:\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\nWe're given a quadratic expression, and we know its roots (the values of *x* that make the expression equal to zero) are integers. We need to find the possible values of the coefficient *s* and then sum them.\n**2. Using the Relationship Between Roots and Coefficients**\nFor a quadratic equation of the form *ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0*, there's a relationship between the roots (*r\u2081* and *r\u2082*) and the coefficients:\n* **Sum of roots:**  *r\u2081 + r\u2082 = -b/a*\n* **Product of roots:** *r\u2081 * r\u2082 = c/a*\n**3. Applying the Relationship to Our Equation**\nIn our equation, *a = 1/2*, *b = s*, and *c = -1/2*.  Since the roots are integers, let's denote them as *m* and *n*.  Now we can write:\n* **Sum of roots:** *m + n = -s / (1/2) = -2s*\n* **Product of roots:** *m * n = (-1/2) / (1/2) = -1*\n**4. Finding Possible Values of *s***\nFrom the product of roots equation, we know that *m* and *n* must be a pair of integers that multiply to -1. The only possibilities are:\n* *m = 1* and *n = -1* \n* *m = -1* and *n = 1*\nNow, let's use the sum of roots equation to find the corresponding values of *s*:\n* If *m = 1* and *n = -1*, then *1 + (-1) = -2s*.  This gives us *s = 0*.\n* If *m = -1* and *n = 1*, then *(-1) + 1 = -2s*. This also gives us *s = 0*.\n**5. The Sum of Possible Values of *s***\nWe found only one possible value of *s*:  *s = 0*.  Therefore, the sum of all possible values of *s* is simply **0**. \n",

The only possibilities are:\n* r = 1, t = -1\n* r = -1, t = 1\n**4. Find Possible Values of *s***\nFor each pair of roots, calculate the corresponding value of *s* using the sum of roots formula:\n* **r = 1, t = -1:**  1 + (-1) = -2s  =>  s = 0\n* **r = -1, t = 1:** -1 + 1 = -2s  => s = 0 \n**5.
