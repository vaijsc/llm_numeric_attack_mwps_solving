        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n1. **Simplify inside the cube root:**  We have four terms of  $4^5$. This can be written as  $4 \\cdot 4^5$.\n2. **Use exponent rules:**  Remember that when multiplying exponents with the same base, you add the powers. So,  $4 \\cdot 4^5 = 4^6$.\n3. **Calculate the cube root:**  The cube root of  $4^6$ is  $4^{6/3} = 4^2$.\n4. **Final answer:**  $4^2 = 16$. \n**Therefore, the value of  $\\sqrt[3]{4^5 + 4^5 + 4^5 + 4^5}$ is 16.** \n",
