        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Simplify the difference:**\n   We're given that  $T(b+1) - T(b) = T(x)$. Let's expand this using the formula for triangular numbers:\n   ```\n   T(b+1) - T(b) =  [(b+1)(b+2)/2] - [b(b+1)/2]\n                   =  [(b^2 + 3b + 2) - (b^2 + b)]/2\n                   =  (2b + 2)/2\n                   = b + 1\n   ```\n   So, we have  $b + 1 = T(x)$.\n**2.  Express T(x) in terms of x:**\n   Recall that $T(x) = x(x+1)/2$.  \n**3.  Set up an equation:**\n   Now we have the equation:  $b + 1 = x(x+1)/2$\n**4.  Solve for x:**\n   To find the smallest integer *b* that satisfies the condition, we need to find the smallest integer *x* that makes the equation true. Let's rearrange the equation:\n   ```\n   2b + 2 = x(x+1)\n   x^2 + x - 2b - 2 = 0\n   ```\n   We want to find the smallest integer *x* that is a solution to this quadratic equation.  Since *x* is an integer, the discriminant of this quadratic must be a perfect square. The discriminant is:\n   ```\n   1^2 - 4(-2b - 2) = 8b + 9\n   ```\n**5.  Find the smallest b that makes the discriminant a perfect square:**\n   We need to find the smallest integer *b* greater than 2011 such that 8*b* + 9 is a perfect square.  Let's start testing values of *b* slightly larger than 2011:\n   * If *b* = 2012, then 8*b* + 9 = 16105, which is not a perfect square.\n   * If *b* = 2013, then 8*b* + 9 = 16113, which is not a perfect square.\n   * ... \n   * If *b* = 2018, then 8*b* + 9 = 16153, which is not a perfect square.\n   * If *b* = 2019, then 8*b* + 9 = 16161 = 127^2 (a perfect square!)\n**6.  Find x:**\n   Since 8*b* + 9 is a perfect square when *b* = 2019, we can find *x* by solving the quadratic:\n   ```\n   x^2 + x - 2(2019) - 2 = 0\n   x^2 + x - 4040 = 0\n   (x - 63)(x + 64) = 0\n   ```\n   This gives us two possible solutions: *x* = 63 or *x* = -64. Since *x* must be a positive integer, we choose *x* = 63.\n**Answer:**\nThe smallest integer *b* greater than 2011 such that *T(b+1) - T(b) = T(x)* for some positive integer *x* is *b* = **2019**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem:\n**1. Understand Triangular Numbers**\nTriangular numbers represent the sum of consecutive positive integers.  For example:\n*  T(1) = 1\n*  T(2) = 1 + 2 = 3\n*  T(3) = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6\n*  T(4) = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 \n**2. Express the Difference**\nWe are given the equation:  T(b + 1) - T(b) = T(x)\nLet's substitute the formula for triangular numbers:\n```\n(b + 1)(b + 2) / 2 - b(b + 1) / 2 = x(x + 1) / 2 \n```\n**3. Simplify the Equation**\nSimplify the left-hand side of the equation:\n```\n[(b + 1)(b + 2) - b(b + 1)] / 2 = x(x + 1) / 2\n[(b^2 + 3b + 2) - (b^2 + b)] / 2 = x(x + 1) / 2\n(2b + 2) / 2 = x(x + 1) / 2\nb + 1 = x(x + 1) / 2 \n```\n**4. Analyze the Equation**\nNotice that the left side (b + 1) is simply one more than the integer 'b'. The right side is a triangular number.

        "Here's a step-by-step solution to find the smallest integer *b* greater than 2011 that satisfies the given condition:\n**1. Understand the Problem**\nWe need to find a triangular number *T(x)* that is equal to the difference between two consecutive triangular numbers, *T(b+1)* and *T(b)*.\n**2. Express the Difference**\nLet's find the difference *T(b+1) - T(b)*:\n*T(b+1) - T(b) = [(b+1)(b+2)/2] - [b(b+1)/2]*\nSimplify by factoring out (b+1)/2:\n*T(b+1) - T(b) = [(b+1)/2] * [(b+2) - b] = (b+1)/2*\n**3. The Condition**\nWe want this difference to be equal to another triangular number *T(x)*:\n*(b+1)/2 = T(x) = x(x+1)/2*\n**4. Solve for x**\nSimplify the equation:\n*b + 1 = x(x+1)*\nWe need to find an integer *x* that satisfies this equation for a *b* greater than 2011.  \n**5.  Finding the Smallest b**\nNotice that the right side of the equation is a product of two consecutive integers. To find the smallest possible *b*, we should look for the smallest *x* such that *x(x+1)* is greater than 2011 + 1 = 2012.\n* 44 * 45 = 1980 \n* 45 * 46 = 2070\nSince 2070 > 2012, we can use *x = 45*.  This gives us:\n* b + 1 = 45 * 46 \n* b = 45 * 46 - 1 = 2069\n**6. Verification**\n* T(2070) - T(2069) = (2070/2) = 1035\n* T(45) = (45 * 46)/2 = 1035\nTherefore, *b = 2069* satisfies the condition, and it's the smallest integer greater than 2011 that does so.\n**Answer:** The smallest integer *b* greater than 2011 such that *T(b+1) - T(b) = T(x)* for some positive integer *x* is **b = 2069**. \n",
        "Here's a step-by-step solution:\n**1. Understand the problem:**\nWe need to find the smallest integer *b* greater than 2011 for which the difference between the *(b+1)th* triangular number and the *b*th triangular number is itself a triangular number.\n**2. Simplify the difference:**\nLet's calculate  *T(b+1) - T(b)*:\n* T(b+1) - T(b) =  ( (b+1)(b+2)/2 ) - ( b(b+1)/2 ) \n* Simplifying, we get:  (b^2 + 3b + 2)/2 - (b^2 + b)/2 = (2b + 2)/2 = b + 1\n**3. The condition:**\nWe want this difference (b+1) to be equal to some triangular number *T(x)*:\n* b + 1 = T(x) = x(x+1)/2\n**4. Finding a solution:**\nNow, we need to find the smallest *b* greater than 2011 that satisfies this equation. Since we are looking for an integer *x*, let's try plugging in some values for *x* and see if we can find a corresponding *b* greater than 2011.\n* If x = 64, then T(x) = 64 * 65 / 2 = 2080.  This means b = 2079, which is less than 2011.\n* If x = 65, then T(x) = 65 * 66 / 2 = 2145. This means b = 2144, which is greater than 2011.\n**5. The answer:**\nSince we found a solution where *b* is greater than 2011, the smallest such integer *b* is **2144**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step by step:\n**1. Understand the Problem:**\nWe're given the formula for triangular numbers and asked to find the smallest integer *b* greater than 2011 that satisfies a specific condition. This condition involves the difference between two consecutive triangular numbers being equal to another triangular number.\n**2. Simplify the Expression:**\nLet's simplify the expression  *T(b + 1) - T(b)* :\n*  *T(b + 1) - T(b) = [(b + 1)(b + 2) / 2] - [b(b + 1) / 2]* \n*  *T(b + 1) - T(b) = [(b^2 + 3b + 2) - (b^2 + b)] / 2*\n*  *T(b + 1) - T(b) = (2b + 2) / 2*\n*  *T(b + 1) - T(b) = b + 1*\n**3. Relate to Triangular Numbers:**\nNow we know that *T(b + 1) - T(b) = b + 1*.  We want this to be equal to *T(x)* for some positive integer *x*.  Therefore, we need to find a value of *b* such that *b + 1* is a triangular number.\n**4. Triangular Number Properties:**\nRecall that a triangular number is the sum of consecutive positive integers.  A useful property is that the difference between consecutive triangular numbers is always an integer.  This is evident from the simplified expression *T(b + 1) - T(b) = b + 1*.\n**5. Finding the Smallest b:**\nSince we want the smallest *b* greater than 2011, we can start by finding the smallest triangular number greater than 2011.  We know that *T(63) = (63 * 64) / 2 = 2016*.  \nIf *b + 1 = 2016*, then *b = 2015*. However, this doesn't satisfy the condition because *T(2016) - T(2015) = 2016* is not a triangular number.\nThe next triangular number is *T(64) = (64 * 65) / 2 = 2080*. \nIf *b + 1 = 2080*, then *b = 2079*.  We need to check if *T(2080) - T(2079) = 2080* is a triangular number.  \nLet's solve for *x* in the equation *T(x) = 2080*:\n* (x(x+1))/2 = 2080\n* x(x+1) = 4160\n* x^2 + x - 4160 = 0\nUsing the quadratic formula, we find that *x = 64* is a solution.  Therefore, *T(64) = 2080* is a triangular number.\n**6. Conclusion:**\nThe smallest integer *b* greater than 2011 such that *T(b + 1) - T(b) = T(x)* for some positive integer *x* is **b = 2079**. \n"
