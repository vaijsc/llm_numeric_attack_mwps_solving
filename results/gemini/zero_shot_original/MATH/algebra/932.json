        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n1. **Calculate the total time for tours:** The tours run from 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., which is a total of 9 hours.\n2. **Convert hours to minutes:**  9 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 540 minutes.\n3. **Calculate the number of tours:** Divide the total time by the time between tours: 540 minutes / 20 minutes/tour = 27 tours.\n**Therefore, there are 27 tours per day in April at the Luray Caverns.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n1. **Calculate the total time for tours:** The last tour starts at 6 p.m., which is 18:00 in 24-hour time. The first tour is at 9 a.m., which is 09:00.  The total time for tours is 18:00 - 09:00 = 9 hours.\n2. **Convert hours to minutes:** There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 9 hours is equal to 9 * 60 = 540 minutes.\n3. **Calculate the number of tours:**  A tour starts every 20 minutes, so in 540 minutes there are 540 / 20 = 27 tours.\n**Therefore, there are 27 tours per day in April at the Luray Caverns.** \n",
