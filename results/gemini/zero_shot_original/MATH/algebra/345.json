    "solution": "In the first quarter, Paula earns $\\frac{0.10}{4}(\\$10,\\!000)$ in interest, so her investment is worth $\\$10,\\!000 +\\frac{0.10}{4}(\\$10,\\!000) = \\left(1 + \\frac{0.10}{4}\\right)(\\$10,\\!000)$. Similarly, the value of her investment is multiplied by $1 + \\frac{0.10}{4}$ each quarter, so after 5 years, which is $5\\cdot 4 = 20$ quarters, her investment is worth \\[\\left(1 + \\frac{0.10}{4}\\right)^{5\\cdot 4}(\\$10,\\!000) \\approx \\boxed{\\$16,\\!386.16}.\\]",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Determine the number of compounding periods:**\n* Since the interest is compounded quarterly, there are 4 compounding periods per year.\n* Over 5 years, there are a total of 4 * 5 = 20 compounding periods.\n**2. Calculate the interest rate per compounding period:**\n* The annual interest rate is 10%, so the quarterly interest rate is 10%/4 = 2.5%.\n**3. Use the compound interest formula:**\nThe formula for compound interest is:\nA = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)\nWhere:\n* A = the future value of the investment/loan, including interest\n* P = the principal investment amount (the initial deposit or loan amount)\n* r = the annual interest rate (as a decimal)\n* n = the number of times that interest is compounded per year\n* t = the number of years the money is invested or borrowed for\n**4. Plug in the values:**\n* P = $10,000\n* r = 0.10 (10% as a decimal)\n* n = 4 (compounded quarterly)\n* t = 5 years\nA = 10000(1 + 0.10/4)^(4*5)\nA = 10000(1 + 0.025)^20\nA = 10000(1.025)^20\nA \u2248 $16386.16\n**Therefore, Paula's investment will be worth approximately $16,386.16 at the end of 5 years.** \n",
