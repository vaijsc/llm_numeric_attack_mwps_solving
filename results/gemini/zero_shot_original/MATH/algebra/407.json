        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\n* **Quadratic Equation:** The given equation is a quadratic equation in the form  ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0, where a = 1, b = m, and c = (m+n).\n* **Unique Real Solution:**  A quadratic equation has one real solution (a double root) when its discriminant (\u0394) is equal to zero.\n**2.  The Discriminant**\n* The discriminant of a quadratic equation is given by: \u0394 = b\u00b2 - 4ac\n* In our case, \u0394 = m\u00b2 - 4(1)(m+n) = m\u00b2 - 4m - 4n\n**3. Setting the Discriminant to Zero**\n* Since we want a unique real solution, we set the discriminant to zero: m\u00b2 - 4m - 4n = 0\n**4. Solving for 'm' (and using the fact it's unique)**\n* The equation m\u00b2 - 4m - 4n = 0 is a quadratic equation in 'm'.  For it to have a unique solution, this quadratic must be a perfect square trinomial. \n* To make it a perfect square, we can use the following: \n    * Take half of the coefficient of 'm' (-4/2 = -2)\n    * Square the result (-2)\u00b2 = 4\n    * Add this value (4) to both sides of the equation: m\u00b2 - 4m + 4 - 4n = 4\n* Now, the left side is a perfect square trinomial: (m - 2)\u00b2 - 4n = 4\n* Solve for 'm': (m - 2)\u00b2 = 4 + 4n\n* Since we have a unique solution, we can take the square root of both sides.  Notice that both the positive and negative square roots would give us a solution for 'm'. To have a unique solution, the right side must be zero.\n* Therefore, 4 + 4n = 0\n**5. Solving for 'n'**\n* Solving for 'n' in the equation 4 + 4n = 0, we get:\n* 4n = -4\n* n = -1\n**Conclusion**\nTherefore, the value of n that satisfies the given conditions is **n = -1**. \n",

Analyze the Solution for Uniqueness**\n*  We need a *unique* value of *m*.
