    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The function is defined when the value inside the square root is positive, i.e. we must have $x^2-5x+6>0$.  Factoring, we get $(x-3)(x-2)>0$. So either both factors in the left hand side are negative or they are both positive. They are both negative when $x<2$. They are both positive when $x>3$. So the domain of $f(x)$ is $x<2 \\text{ or } x>3$, or $x \\in \\boxed{(-\\infty, 2) \\cup (3, \\infty)}$ in interval notation.",

        "Here's how to find the domain of the function step-by-step:\n**1. Identify Restrictions**\n* **Square Root:** The expression inside the square root must be non-negative (greater than or equal to zero) to avoid taking the square root of a negative number.\n* **Denominator:** The denominator cannot be zero, as division by zero is undefined.\n**2. Apply the Restrictions**\n* **Square Root Restriction:** \n   *  We need to find when  $x^2 - 5x + 6 \\ge 0$.\n   * Factor the quadratic: $(x-2)(x-3) \\ge 0$.\n   * This inequality is true when both factors are non-negative or both factors are non-positive. \n      *  **Case 1:** $x-2 \\ge 0$ and $x-3 \\ge 0$, which means  $x \\ge 2$ and $x \\ge 3$. The solution to this case is $x \\ge 3$.\n      *  **Case 2:** $x-2 \\le 0$ and $x-3 \\le 0$, which means $x \\le 2$ and $x \\le 3$. The solution to this case is $x \\le 2$.\n* **Denominator Restriction:**\n   * We need to find when  $x^2 - 5x + 6 \\neq 0$.\n   * We already factored this expression:  $(x-2)(x-3) \\neq 0$.\n   * This means $x \\neq 2$ and $x \\neq 3$.\n**3. Combine the Restrictions**\n* We need to satisfy both the square root restriction and the denominator restriction. \n* Combining our findings, the domain of the function is: \n   *  $x \\le 2$ OR $x \\ge 3$, but also excluding $x = 2$ and $x = 3$. \n**4. Express the Domain**\nWe can express the domain in interval notation as:\n**Domain:  (\u2212\u221e, 2) \u222a (2, 3) \u222a (3, \u221e)** \n",
        "Here's how to find the domain of the function step-by-step:\n**1. Identify Restrictions:**\n* **Denominator cannot be zero:**  The square root in the denominator means the expression inside the square root must be non-negative. Additionally, the denominator itself cannot be zero. \n* **Radicand (expression inside the square root) must be non-negative:** This ensures the square root is defined.\n**2. Solve the Inequalities:**\n* **Radicand:**  We need  $x^2 - 5x + 6 \\ge 0$. Factor the quadratic: $(x-2)(x-3) \\ge 0$. This inequality holds when both factors are non-negative or both are non-positive. \n    *  $x \\le 2$ or $x \\ge 3$\n* **Denominator:** We need $\\sqrt{x^2 - 5x + 6} \\neq 0$.  This means $(x-2)(x-3) \\neq 0$. Therefore, $x \\neq 2$ and $x \\neq 3$.\n**3. Combine the Restrictions:**\nWe need the following conditions to be true simultaneously:\n* $x \\le 2$ or $x \\ge 3$\n* $x \\neq 2$ and $x \\neq 3$\n**4.

        "Here's how to determine the domain of the function step-by-step:\n**1. Identify Restrictions**\nThe function has two potential restrictions:\n* **The denominator cannot be zero:**  We need to ensure that the expression under the square root is positive, otherwise the function would be undefined.\n* **The expression under the square root must be non-negative:**  We can't take the square root of a negative number.\n**2. Solve the Restrictions**\n* **Denominator not zero:** \n   We need to find the values of *x* that make  *x\u00b2 - 5x + 6 = 0*.  Factoring this quadratic equation gives us:\n   (x - 2)(x - 3) = 0\n   Therefore, x = 2 and x = 3 make the denominator zero.\n* **Expression under the square root non-negative:**\n   We need to find the values of *x* that make *x\u00b2 - 5x + 6 \u2265 0*.  We already know that the expression equals zero at x = 2 and x = 3. Let's consider the intervals determined by these values:\n    * **x < 2:** Choose a test value, like x = 0.  (0)\u00b2 - 5(0) + 6 = 6 > 0, so the expression is positive in this interval.\n    * **2 < x < 3:** Choose a test value, like x = 2.5.  (2.5)\u00b2 - 5(2.5) + 6 = -0.25 < 0, so the expression is negative in this interval.\n    * **x > 3:** Choose a test value, like x = 4.  (4)\u00b2 - 5(4) + 6 = 2 > 0, so the expression is positive in this interval.\n**3. Combine the Restrictions**\nWe need both the denominator to be non-zero *and* the expression under the square root to be non-negative.  This means we need to exclude the values x = 2 and x = 3, and include the intervals where the expression is positive.\n**4. Express the Domain**\nThe domain of the function is all real numbers *x* such that: \n* **x < 2  or  x > 3**\nWe can express this in interval notation as:\n**(-\u221e, 2) \u222a (3, \u221e)** \n",
