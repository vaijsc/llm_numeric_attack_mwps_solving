    "problem": "Two identical blue boxes together weigh the same as three identical red boxes together. Each red box weighs 15.2 ounces. How much does one blue box weigh in ounces?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since one red box weighs 15.2 ounces, three red boxes weigh 45.6 ounces.  This is the same as two blue boxes, so  we have the equation $2b=45.6$ where $b$ represents the weight of the blue box. Solving the equation by multiplying both sides by $\\frac{1}{2}$ to isolate $b$ gives us $b=\\boxed{22.8}$ ounces.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n1. **Find the total weight of three red boxes:** Since each red box weighs 15.2 ounces, three red boxes weigh 15.2 ounces/box * 3 boxes = 45.6 ounces.\n2. **Determine the weight of one blue box:** We know that two blue boxes weigh the same as three red boxes, which is 45.6 ounces.  Therefore, one blue box weighs 45.6 ounces / 2 boxes = 22.8 ounces.\n**Answer:** One blue box weighs 22.8 ounces. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n1. **Find the total weight of the red boxes:** Since each red box weighs 15.2 ounces, and we have three of them, their total weight is 15.2 ounces/box * 3 boxes = 45.6 ounces.\n2. **The blue boxes weigh the same as the red boxes:**  We know that two blue boxes weigh the same as three red boxes, which means they weigh 45.6 ounces.\n3. **Find the weight of one blue box:**  To find the weight of one blue box, we divide the total weight of the blue boxes by the number of blue boxes: 45.6 ounces / 2 boxes = 22.8 ounces/box.\n**Therefore, one blue box weighs 22.8 ounces.** \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the total weight of three red boxes:**\n* Since each red box weighs 15.2 ounces, three red boxes weigh 3 * 15.2 = 45.6 ounces.\n**2. Understand the relationship:**\n* We know that the weight of two blue boxes is equal to the weight of three red boxes.\n**3. Find the weight of one blue box:**\n* Since two blue boxes weigh 45.6 ounces, one blue box weighs 45.6 / 2 = 22.8 ounces.\n**Answer:** One blue box weighs 22.8 ounces. \n",
