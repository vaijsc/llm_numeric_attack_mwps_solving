In general, minimization problems like this require calculus, but one optimization method that sometimes works is to try to complete the square.  Pulling out a factor of $\\frac{1}{4}$ from under the radical, we have \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{4x^2+x^4-36x^2+324}&=\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{(x^4-32x^2+256)+68} \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{(x^2-16)^2+68}\n\\end{align*}This last expression is minimized when the square equals $0$, that is, when $x^2=16$. Then the distance is $\\frac{\\sqrt{68}}{2}=\\sqrt{17}$.  Hence the desired answer is $\\sqrt{17}^2 = \\boxed{17}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Problem**\nWe want to find the shortest distance between the origin (0, 0) and any point on the parabola  y = (1/2)x^2 - 9. This shortest distance is represented by a line perpendicular to the parabola at the closest point.\n**2. Visualize the Situation**\nImagine the parabola and the origin. The shortest distance will be a line segment that is perpendicular to the parabola.\n**3. Use the Distance Formula**\nThe distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by:\n\u221a((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)\nSince we want the distance between the origin (0, 0) and a point (x, y) on the parabola, the distance formula becomes:\n\u221a(x^2 + y^2)\n**4. Substitute the Equation of the Parabola**\nWe know y = (1/2)x^2 - 9. Substitute this into the distance formula:\n\u221a(x^2 + ((1/2)x^2 - 9)^2)\n**5. Minimize the Distance**\nTo find the shortest distance, we need to minimize the expression under the square root.  Let's call this expression D(x):\nD(x) = x^2 + ((1/2)x^2 - 9)^2\n**6. Find the Critical Points**\nTo find the minimum of D(x), we take its derivative and set it equal to zero:\nD'(x) = 2x + 2((1/2)x^2 - 9)(x) = 0\nSimplify and solve for x:\nx + x^3 - 9x = 0\nx^3 - 8x = 0\nx(x^2 - 8) = 0\nThis gives us three possible solutions: x = 0, x = \u221a8, and x = -\u221a8.\n**7. Determine the Minimum**\nWe need to test the critical points and the endpoints of the parabola to find the minimum distance. Since the parabola extends infinitely, we can't test the endpoints.  We can use the second derivative test to determine if the critical points correspond to a minimum:\nD''(x) = 6x^2 - 8\nD''(0) = -8 (This corresponds to a maximum)\nD''(\u221a8) = 32 (This corresponds to a minimum)\nD''(-\u221a8) = 32 (This corresponds to a minimum)\n**8. Calculate the Minimum Distance**\nSince the minimum distance occurs at x = \u221a8 and x = -\u221a8, we'll use either one to calculate the distance. Let's use x = \u221a8:\ny = (1/2)(\u221a8)^2 - 9 = -1\nNow, use the distance formula with the point (\u221a8, -1):\n\u221a((\u221a8)^2 + (-1)^2) = \u221a9 = 3\n**9. Find a^2**\nThe smallest distance is 3, so a = 3.  Therefore, a^2 = 3^2 = **9**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Visualize the Problem**\nImagine the graph of the parabola  y = (1/2)x\u00b2 - 9.  The origin is the point (0,0). We want to find the shortest line segment connecting the origin to a point on the parabola.\n**2. Distance Formula**\nThe distance between a point (x, y) on the parabola and the origin (0, 0) is given by the distance formula:\n```\nDistance = \u221a[(x - 0)\u00b2 + (y - 0)\u00b2] = \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) \n```\n**3. Substitute the Equation of the Parabola**\nSince the point (x, y) lies on the parabola, we know y = (1/2)x\u00b2 - 9. Substitute this into the distance formula:\n```\nDistance = \u221a[x\u00b2 + ((1/2)x\u00b2 - 9)\u00b2] \n```\n**4. Minimize the Distance**\nOur goal is to find the smallest possible value of the distance. To do this, we'll minimize the expression inside the square root.  Let's call this expression D:\n```\nD = x\u00b2 + ((1/2)x\u00b2 - 9)\u00b2\n```\n**5.

Determine the Minimum**\nWe need to check which value of x actually minimizes D. We could use the second derivative test, but it's easier to simply evaluate D at each of the critical points:\n* D(0) = 81\n* D(-4) = 64\n* D(4) = 64\nThe minimum value of D occurs at x = -4 and x = 4. \n**7. Calculate the Minimum Distance**\nSince the distance is minimized at x = -4 and x = 4, we can calculate the minimum distance:\n```\nDistance = \u221a[(-4)\u00b2 + ((1/2)(-4)\u00b2 - 9)\u00b2] = \u221a(16 + 1) = \u221a17\n```\n**8. Find a\u00b2**\nThe problem asks for the value of a\u00b2, where a is the smallest distance. Therefore:\n```\na\u00b2 = (\u221a17)\u00b2 = **17**\n```\n**Answer:** The smallest distance between the origin and a point on the graph of y = (1/2)x\u00b2 - 9 can be expressed as \u221a17, and a\u00b2 = **17**. \n",

Differentiation and Minimization**\n* **Simplify D:**  D = x\u00b2 + (1/4)x\u2074 - 9x\u00b2 + 81 = (1/4)x\u2074 - 8x\u00b2 + 81 \n* **Take the derivative:** dD/dx = x\u00b3 - 16x\n* **Set the derivative equal to zero:** x\u00b3 - 16x = 0\n* **Solve for x:**  x(x\u00b2 - 16) = 0. This gives us solutions x = 0, x = 4, and x = -4.\n**6. Find the Minimum Distance**\nTo determine if these x-values correspond to a minimum, we can use the second derivative test:\n* **Second derivative:** d\u00b2D/dx\u00b2 = 3x\u00b2 - 16\n* **Evaluate the second derivative at each x-value:**\n    *  d\u00b2D/dx\u00b2 (0) = -16 (maximum)\n    *  d\u00b2D/dx\u00b2 (4) = 32 (minimum)\n    *  d\u00b2D/dx\u00b2 (-4) = 32 (minimum)\nThis indicates that the distance is minimized at x = 4 and x = -4. Since the parabola is symmetric, the shortest distance will be the same for both values.\n**7. Calculate the Shortest Distance**\nLet's use x = 4:\n*  y = (1/2)(4)\u00b2 - 9 = -1\n*  Distance = \u221a(4\u00b2 + (-1)\u00b2) = \u221a17\n**8. Find a\u00b2**\nThe shortest distance is \u221a17.

We want to find the shortest distance between the origin and any point on the parabola.\n**2. Use the Distance Formula**\nThe distance between a point on the parabola $(x, \\frac{1}{2}x^2 - 9)$ and the origin (0, 0) is given by the distance formula:\n```\nDistance = \u221a[(x - 0)^2 + ( (1/2)x^2 - 9 - 0)^2] \n          = \u221a[x^2 + (1/4)x^4 - 9x^2 + 81]\n          = \u221a[(1/4)x^4 - 8x^2 + 81]\n```\n**3. Minimize the Distance**\nTo find the shortest distance, we need to minimize the expression under the square root. Let's call this expression  *D* for \"distance squared\":\n```\nD = (1/4)x^4 - 8x^2 + 81 \n```\n**4. Calculus to the Rescue**\nThe minimum value of *D* occurs at a critical point, where its derivative is zero:\n```\nD' = x^3 - 16x = 0 \n```\nFactoring, we get:\n```\nx(x^2 - 16) = 0\nx(x + 4)(x - 4) = 0 \n```\nThis gives us three critical points: x = 0, x = -4, and x = 4.\n**5. Find the Minimum**\nWe need to determine which critical point gives the minimum value of *D*.  We can use the second derivative test:\n```\nD'' = 3x^2 - 16\n```\n* At x = 0, D'' = -16 (negative, indicating a maximum)\n* At x = -4, D'' = 32 (positive, indicating a minimum)\n* At x = 4, D'' = 32 (positive, indicating a minimum)\nThe minimum occurs at x = -4 and x = 4. Since the parabola is symmetrical, the minimum distance is the same in both cases.\n**6. Calculate the Minimum Distance**\nLet's use x = 4 (we could use x = -4 as well):\n```\nD = (1/4)(4)^4 - 8(4)^2 + 81 = 16\n```\nSince *D* is the distance squared, the minimum distance is \u221a16 = 4.\n**7. Answer**\nThe smallest distance between the origin and the graph of the parabola is 4.  Therefore,  *a* = 4 and *a*\u00b2 = **16**. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Problem**\nWe want to find the shortest distance between the origin (0,0) and any point on the parabola defined by the equation  y = (1/2)x\u00b2 - 9.\n**2. Use the Distance Formula**\nThe distance between two points (x\u2081, y\u2081) and (x\u2082, y\u2082) is given by:\n\u221a[(x\u2082 - x\u2081)\u00b2 + (y\u2082 - y\u2081)\u00b2]\nSince we're finding the distance from the origin (0,0) to a point on the parabola (x, y), the distance formula becomes:\n\u221a[x\u00b2 + y\u00b2]\n**3. Substitute the Equation of the Parabola**\nWe know that y = (1/2)x\u00b2 - 9. Substitute this into the distance formula:\n\u221a[x\u00b2 + ((1/2)x\u00b2 - 9)\u00b2]\n**4. Minimize the Distance**\nTo find the shortest distance, we need to minimize the expression inside the square root.  It's easier to work with the square of the distance, so let's consider:\nf(x) = x\u00b2 + ((1/2)x\u00b2 - 9)\u00b2\n**5. Find the Minimum of f(x)**\n* **Take the derivative:** f'(x) = 2x + 2((1/2)x\u00b2 - 9)(x)\n* **Set the derivative equal to zero:** 2x + 2((1/2)x\u00b2 - 9)(x) = 0\n* **Solve for x:**  Simplify the equation and solve for x. You'll find that x = 0 and x = \u00b16 are the critical points.\n**6. Determine the Minimum**\nWe need to check which critical point gives the minimum value of f(x). We can use the second derivative test:\n* **Find the second derivative:** f''(x) = 2 + 2((1/2)x\u00b2 - 9) + 2x\u00b2\n* **Evaluate the second derivative at the critical points:**\n    * f''(0) = -16 < 0  (Indicates a maximum)\n    * f''(\u00b16) = 20 > 0 (Indicates a minimum)\n**7. Calculate the Minimum Distance**\nSince the minimum occurs at x = \u00b16, we can find the corresponding y values:\ny = (1/2)(\u00b16)\u00b2 - 9 = 9\nTherefore, the shortest distance occurs at the points (6, 9) and (-6, 9).  Let's calculate the distance from the origin to either of these points:\nDistance = \u221a[(6)\u00b2 + (9)\u00b2] = \u221a117 = 3\u221a13\n**8. Find a\u00b2**\nFinally, the problem asks for a\u00b2, where 'a' is the shortest distance. So:\na\u00b2 = (3\u221a13)\u00b2 = **117** \n"
