        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Relationship Between Roots and Coefficients**\nFor a quadratic equation of the form  ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0, the following relationships hold:\n* **Sum of roots:**  -b/a\n* **Product of roots:** c/a\n**2. Apply the Relationships to Our Equation**\nIn our equation, x\u00b2 - 7x + c = 0:\n* **Sum of roots:** 7 \n* **Product of roots:** c\n**3. Real and Rational Roots**\nWe want the roots to be both real and rational.  This means:\n* **Real Roots:** The discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac) of the quadratic equation must be non-negative.\n* **Rational Roots:** The roots can be expressed as fractions where the numerator and denominator are integers.\n**4. Analyze the Discriminant**\nIn our equation, a = 1, b = -7, and c = c.  The discriminant is:\n(-7)\u00b2 - 4(1)(c) = 49 - 4c\nFor real roots, 49 - 4c \u2265 0.  Solving for c, we get c \u2264 49/4.\n**5. Analyze the Product of Roots**\nSince the roots must be rational, their product (c) must also be rational. \n**6. Combine the Conditions**\nWe need to find integer values of c that satisfy both:\n* c \u2264 49/4 \n* c is an integer\nThe largest integer less than 49/4 is 12.\n**7. Check for Rational Roots**\nWe need to make sure that for each integer value of c \u2264 12, the quadratic equation has rational roots.  We can do this by checking if the discriminant is a perfect square.\nLet's check:\n* **c = 12:**  49 - 4(12) = 1. The discriminant is a perfect square (1\u00b2), so the roots are rational.\n* **c = 11:**  49 - 4(11) = 5. The discriminant is not a perfect square, so the roots are not rational.\n* **c = 10:**  49 - 4(10) = 9. The discriminant is a perfect square (3\u00b2), so the roots are rational.\n* **c = 9:**  49 - 4(9) = 13. The discriminant is not a perfect square, so the roots are not rational.\n* **... and so on**\n**8. Final Answer**\nThe positive integer values of c that satisfy the conditions are 12 and 10.  \n**Answer:** 12, 10 \n",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Conditions:**\n* **Real Roots:**  A quadratic equation has real roots if and only if its discriminant is non-negative. The discriminant of the quadratic  $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is $b^2 - 4ac$.\n* **Rational Roots:**  Rational roots of a polynomial with integer coefficients can be found using the Rational Root Theorem. This theorem states that any rational root must be of the form  p/q, where p is a factor of the constant term (c in our case) and q is a factor of the leading coefficient (1 in our case).\n**2. Apply the Conditions:**\n* **Discriminant:** For the equation $x^2 - 7x + c = 0$, the discriminant is $(-7)^2 - 4(1)(c) = 49 - 4c$.  We need this to be non-negative: \n   $49 - 4c \\ge 0$\n   $4c \\le 49$\n   $c \\le \\frac{49}{4}$\n* **Rational Root Theorem:** The factors of the constant term 'c' will determine the possible rational roots. Since we want the roots to be rational, we need to find values of 'c' that lead to factors that can be expressed as p/q, where p divides c and q divides 1 (which means q is 1).\n**3. Combine the Conditions:**\n* We need to find values of 'c' that are less than or equal to 49/4 and also lead to rational roots.\n**4. Analyze and Solve:**\n*  Let's start by trying some values of 'c' less than or equal to 49/4.  Since 49/4 is approximately 12.25, we'll try values of 'c' up to 12.\n* **c = 12:**  The equation becomes $x^2 - 7x + 12 = 0$. This factors as (x-3)(x-4) = 0, giving us rational roots x=3 and x=4.\n* **c = 11:** The equation becomes $x^2 - 7x + 11 = 0$. This doesn't factor easily. The discriminant is $49 - 4(11) = 5$, which is not a perfect square. This means the roots are irrational.\n* **c = 10:** The equation becomes $x^2 - 7x + 10 = 0$. This factors as (x-2)(x-5) = 0, giving us rational roots x=2 and x=5.\n* **c = 9:** The equation becomes $x^2 - 7x + 9 = 0$. This doesn't factor easily. The discriminant is $49 - 4(9) = 13$, which is not a perfect square. The roots are irrational.\n* ... and so on.\nWe can continue testing values of 'c', but we notice a pattern:\n* Values of 'c' that are perfect squares (like 12 = 3*4 and 10 = 2*5) lead to equations that factor and give rational roots.\n* Values of 'c' that are not perfect squares lead to equations with irrational roots.\n**5.

Combine the conditions and find possible values of c:**\n* We need to find values of *c* that satisfy both the discriminant condition and the rational root theorem.\n* Let's start by considering the largest possible values of *c* that satisfy the discriminant condition:\n    * If $c = 12$, the discriminant is negative, so there are no real roots.\n    * If $c = 11$, the discriminant is 1, and the roots are real.  However, the roots are not rational because 11 has no factors other than 1 and 11.\n    * If $c = 10$, the discriminant is 9, and the roots are real.  The roots are rational because 10 has factors of 1, 2, 5, and 10.\n* We can continue this process, checking each possible value of *c* down to 0.\n**5.
