    "solution": "Suppose the roots of the quadratic are given by $m$ and $n$. Note that $$(x-m)(x-n) = x^2 - (m+n)x + mn = x^2 + ax + 5a,$$ and setting coefficients equal, it follows that  \\begin{align*}\nm + n &= -a \\\\\nmn &= 5a\n\\end{align*} (This also follows directly from Vieta's formulas.) Notice that the $a$ can be canceled by either dividing or noting that $$0 = 5a + 5 \\cdot (-a) = mn + 5(m+n).$$\n\nSimon's Favorite Factoring Trick can now be applied: $$mn + 5m + 5n + 25 = (m+5)(n+5) = 25.$$ It follows that $m+5$ and $n+5$ are divisors of $25$, whose pairs of divisors are given by $\\pm \\{(1,25),(5,5),(25,1)\\}$. Solving, we see that $(m,n)$ is in the set $$\\{(-4,20),(0,0),(20,-4),(-6,-30),(-10,-10),(-30,-6)\\}.$$ However, the two pairs of symmetric solutions yield redundant values for $a$, so it follows that the answer is $\\boxed{4}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Problem:**\nWe're given a quadratic equation and asked to find how many integer values of 'a' will make the equation have integer solutions for 'x'. This means we need to find values of 'a' that make the quadratic factorable into two binomials with integer coefficients.\n**2. Use the Discriminant:**\nThe discriminant of a quadratic equation (in the form  ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0) is given by:\n  * \u0394 = b\u00b2 - 4ac\nThe discriminant tells us about the nature of the roots:\n* If \u0394 > 0, the equation has two distinct real roots.\n* If \u0394 = 0, the equation has one real root (a double root).\n* If \u0394 < 0, the equation has no real roots (only complex roots).\n**3. Apply the Discriminant to Our Problem:**\nIn our equation, x\u00b2 + ax + 5a = 0:\n* a = 1\n* b = a\n* c = 5a\nThe discriminant becomes:\n  * \u0394 = a\u00b2 - 4(1)(5a) = a\u00b2 - 20a\nFor the equation to have integer solutions, the discriminant must be a perfect square (since the square root of the discriminant is involved in the quadratic formula).\n**4. Factor the Discriminant:**\nWe can factor the discriminant:\n  * \u0394 = a\u00b2 - 20a = a(a - 20)\nFor \u0394 to be a perfect square, both 'a' and (a - 20) must either be perfect squares or have a common factor that, when squared, gives a perfect square.\n**5. Find Possible Values of 'a':**\nLet's consider some cases:\n* **Case 1: Both 'a' and (a - 20) are perfect squares.** \n   *  The only possible value of 'a' that satisfies this is a = 16 (since 16 and -4 are both perfect squares).\n* **Case 2: 'a' and (a - 20) have a common factor that, when squared, gives a perfect square.**\n   * This case is more complex.  We need to find factors of 20 (which is the constant term in the factored discriminant) that, when squared, give a perfect square. The only factor pair that works is 4 and 5 (since 4 * 5 = 20, and 4 is a perfect square). \n   * This means 'a' could be either 4 or 25.  However, if 'a' is 25, then (a - 20) is 5, which is not a perfect square. So, we discard 'a' = 25. \n**6. Test the Possible Solutions:**\n*  If a = 16:  The equation becomes x\u00b2 + 16x + 80 = 0, which factors as (x + 8)(x + 10) = 0, giving integer solutions.\n* If a = 4: The equation becomes x\u00b2 + 4x + 20 = 0. This equation does not factor into integers.\n**7. The Answer:**\nThere is only **one** integer value of 'a' that makes the equation have integer solutions:  **a = 16**. \n",
        "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Use the Discriminant**\n* For a quadratic equation of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the discriminant, denoted by $\\Delta$, is given by:  $\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac$. \n* The discriminant tells us about the nature of the roots:\n    * If $\\Delta > 0$, the equation has two distinct real roots.\n    * If $\\Delta = 0$, the equation has one real root (a double root).\n    * If $\\Delta < 0$, the equation has no real roots (complex roots).\n**2. Apply the Discriminant to our Equation**\n* In our equation, $x^2 + ax + 5a = 0$, we have:\n    * $a = 1$\n    * $b = a$\n    * $c = 5a$\n* Therefore, the discriminant is:  $\\Delta = a^2 - 4(1)(5a) = a^2 - 20a$\n**3.  Integer Solutions Mean the Discriminant Must be a Perfect Square**\n* We want integer solutions for *x*.  This means the quadratic must factor, which implies the discriminant must be a perfect square.  \n**4. Factor the Discriminant**\n*  Factor the discriminant: $\\Delta = a^2 - 20a = a(a - 20)$\n**5. Analyze the Factors**\n* For $\\Delta$ to be a perfect square, both $a$ and $(a-20)$ must be perfect squares or both must have a common factor that, when squared, results in a perfect square.\n**6. Find Possible Values of 'a'**\n* **Case 1: Both 'a' and (a-20) are perfect squares.**\n    * The only perfect squares within 20 units of each other are 1 and 16. So, $a=1$ or $a=16$. \n* **Case 2:  'a' and (a-20) have a common factor.**\n    *  Let the common factor be $k$. Then $a = k^2$ and $a-20 = k^2 - 20 = m^2$ for some integer $m$.\n    * This leads to $k^2 - m^2 = 20$. Factoring the left side, we get: $(k+m)(k-m) = 20$.\n    * The only factors of 20 that differ by an even number (to ensure both $k+m$ and $k-m$ are integers) are 10 and 2. \n    * Solving the system $k+m = 10$ and $k-m = 2$, we get $k = 6$.  This gives us $a = k^2 = 36$.\n**7.  Check Our Solutions**\n*  Let's check if the values we found for $a$ actually lead to integer solutions:\n    *  For $a = 1$: The equation becomes $x^2 + x + 5 = 0$. This equation does not have integer solutions.\n    *  For $a = 16$: The equation becomes $x^2 + 16x + 80 = 0$, which factors as $(x+10)(x+8) = 0$. This gives integer solutions.\n    *  For $a = 36$: The equation becomes $x^2 + 36x + 180 = 0$, which factors as $(x+6)(x+30) = 0$. This gives integer solutions.\n**8.  Final Answer**\n*  Therefore, the equation $x^2 + ax + 5a = 0$ has integer solutions for **two** integer values of $a$: $\\boxed{16}$ and $\\boxed{36}$. \n",

Understand the Problem**\nWe're given a quadratic equation and asked to find how many values of 'a' will make the equation have integer solutions for 'x'. This means we need to find integer values for 'a' that will lead to the quadratic having integer roots.\n**2.

Apply the Discriminant to Our Equation**\nIn our equation, $x^2 + ax + 5a = 0$, we have:\n* a = 1\n* b = a\n* c = 5a\nLet's plug these values into the discriminant formula:\n* \u0394 = $a^2 - 4(1)(5a)$\n* \u0394 = $a^2 - 20a$\n**4.  Find Integer Solutions**\nFor the quadratic to have integer roots, the discriminant (\u0394) must be a perfect square.  So we need to find values of 'a' that make  $a^2 - 20a$ a perfect square.\nLet's factor out an 'a' from the expression:\n* \u0394 = $a(a - 20)$\nTo make this expression a perfect square, we need both 'a' and 'a - 20' to be perfect squares or one of them to be zero. \n* **Case 1: a = 0**  This makes the equation x\u00b2 = 0, which has an integer solution (x = 0).\n* **Case 2: a - 20 = 0** This means a = 20.

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Quadratic Formula**\nThe quadratic formula gives us the solutions (roots) of a quadratic equation in the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$:\n$$x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$\n**2. Apply the Quadratic Formula to Our Equation**\nIn our case, $a = 1$, $b = a$, and $c = 5a$.  Substituting these values into the quadratic formula:\n$$x = \\frac{-a \\pm \\sqrt{a^2 - 4(1)(5a)}}{2(1)}$$\n$$x = \\frac{-a \\pm \\sqrt{a^2 - 20a}}{2}$$\n**3. Focus on Integer Solutions**\nWe want integer solutions for *x*. This means the expression under the square root,  $a^2 - 20a$, must be a perfect square.  Let's analyze this expression:\n* **Factor out an 'a':**  $a^2 - 20a = a(a - 20)$\n* **For the product to be a perfect square, both 'a' and 'a - 20' must be perfect squares.**\n**4. Find the Possible Values of 'a'**\nSince  'a' and 'a - 20' need to be perfect squares, let's consider the smallest perfect squares:\n* If $a = 1$, then $a - 20 = -19$ (not a perfect square)\n* If $a = 4$, then $a - 20 = -16$ (not a perfect square)\n* If $a = 9$, then $a - 20 = -11$ (not a perfect square)\n* ... \n* If $a = 100$, then $a - 20 = 80$ (not a perfect square)\nNotice a pattern: Since  'a' and 'a - 20' must both be perfect squares, they must differ by 20.  However, there are no two perfect squares that differ by 20.\n**5. Conclusion**\nTherefore, there are **no** integer values of 'a' for which the equation $x^2 + ax + 5a = 0$ has integer solutions. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Quadratic Formula**\nFor a quadratic equation of the form  $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the solutions (roots) are given by the quadratic formula:\n  x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / 2a \n**2.

Integer Solutions Require a Perfect Square**\nFor *x* to be an integer, the expression inside the square root (a\u00b2 - 20a) must be a perfect square. Let's analyze this further:\n* **Factor out an 'a':**  a\u00b2 - 20a = a(a - 20)\n* **Perfect Square Condition:** For a(a - 20) to be a perfect square, both 'a' and (a - 20) must be perfect squares themselves, or one of them must be a multiple of a perfect square.\n**4. Finding Values of 'a'**\nLet's consider possible values of 'a':\n* **If 'a' is a perfect square:**  The smallest perfect square greater than 20 is 25.  If a = 25, then (a - 20) = 5, which is not a perfect square.  Larger perfect square values for 'a' will result in (a - 20) being even further from a perfect square.\n* **If (a - 20) is a perfect square:** We need to find values of 'a' that make (a - 20) a perfect square.  Let's start by listing out a few perfect squares: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25...\n   * If (a - 20) = 1, then a = 21.  But 21 is not a perfect square.\n   * If (a - 20) = 4, then a = 24.  But 24 is not a perfect square.\n   * If (a - 20) = 9, then a = 29.  But 29 is not a perfect square.\n   * If (a - 20) = 16, then a = 36.  But 36 is not a perfect square. \n   * We can see that as we increase the value of (a - 20), the value of 'a' gets further away from a perfect square.\n**5. The Only Solution**\nThe only way for both 'a' and (a - 20) to be perfect squares simultaneously is if  **a = 0**.  In this case, (a - 20) = -20, which is not a perfect square, but 'a' itself is a perfect square. \n**Conclusion**\nThere is only **one** integer value of 'a' that satisfies the given conditions: **a = 0**. \n"
