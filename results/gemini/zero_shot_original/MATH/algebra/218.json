    "solution": "Call the coordinates of point $B$ $(x,y)$. The coordinates of a midpoint are the average of the coordinates of the two endpoints, so we know that $\\frac{-2+x}{2} = 1$ and $\\frac{1+y}{2} = -6$. Solving for $x$ and $y$ gives $x = 4$ and $y = -13$. We take the sum of $x$ and $y$ for an answer of $\\boxed{-9}$.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Midpoint Formula:**\nThe midpoint of a line segment is the point that is exactly halfway between the two endpoints. The midpoint formula states:\n* **Midpoint =  ((x1 + x2)/2, (y1 + y2)/2)**\nwhere (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are the coordinates of the endpoints.\n**2. Apply the Formula:**\n* We know the midpoint *M* is (1, -6) and one endpoint *A* is (-2, 1). Let the coordinates of the other endpoint *B* be (x, y).\n* Using the midpoint formula, we can write: \n    * (1, -6) = ((-2 + x)/2, (1 + y)/2)\n**3. Solve for the Coordinates of B:**\n* To find *x*, we set the x-coordinates equal:\n    * 1 = (-2 + x)/2\n    * 2 = -2 + x\n    * x = 4\n* To find *y*, we set the y-coordinates equal:\n    * -6 = (1 + y)/2\n    * -12 = 1 + y\n    * y = -13\n**4. Find the Sum of the Coordinates of B:**\n* The coordinates of point *B* are (4, -13).\n* The sum of the coordinates is 4 + (-13) = **-9**. \n",
