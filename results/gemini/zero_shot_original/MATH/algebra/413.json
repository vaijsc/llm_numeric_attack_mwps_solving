        "Let's call the value of the expression $x$:\n$$x = \\sqrt{12-\\!\\sqrt{12-\\!\\sqrt{12-\\cdots}}}$$\nNotice that the expression inside the square root is the same as the entire expression.  This means we can substitute $x$ into itself:\n$$x = \\sqrt{12 - x}$$\nNow we have a simple equation to solve. Squaring both sides, we get:\n$$x^2 = 12 - x$$\nRearranging, we get a quadratic equation:\n$$x^2 + x - 12 = 0$$\nFactoring, we have:\n$$(x+4)(x-3) = 0$$\nThis gives us two possible solutions: $x = -4$ and $x = 3$. Since the expression under the square root must be non-negative, we discard the negative solution. \nTherefore, the value of the expression is $\\boxed{3}$. \n",
        "Let  \n$$x = \\sqrt{12-\\!\\sqrt{12-\\!\\sqrt{12-\\cdots}}}.$$ \nSince the expression continues infinitely, we can write\n$$x = \\sqrt{12 - x}.$$ Squaring both sides gives \n$$x^2 = 12 - x.$$ \nRearranging, we get the quadratic equation \n$$x^2 + x - 12 = 0.$$ \nFactoring, we have \n$$(x+4)(x-3) = 0.$$ \nTherefore, $x = -4$ or $x = 3$.  Since the square root of a number is non-negative, the answer is $\\boxed{3}$. \n",
