    "problem": "Abby, Bart, Cindy and Damon weigh themselves in pairs. Together Abby and Bart weigh 160 pounds, Bart and Cindy weigh 180 pounds, and Cindy and Damon weigh 200 pounds. How many pounds do Abby and Damon weigh together?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let the weights of Abby, Bart, Cindy, and Damon be $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$, respectively. We have the equations \\begin{align*}\na+b&=160\\\\\nb+c&=180\\\\\nc+d&=200\n\\end{align*} Subtracting the second equation from the first, we have $(a+b)-(b+c)=160-180 \\Rightarrow a-c=-20$. Adding this last equation to the third given equation, we have $(a-c)+(c+d)=-20+200 \\Rightarrow a+d=180$. Thus, Abby and Damon together weigh $\\boxed{180}$ pounds.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Represent the weights with variables:**\n* Let Abby's weight be 'A'\n* Let Bart's weight be 'B'\n* Let Cindy's weight be 'C'\n* Let Damon's weight be 'D'\n**2.  Write down the given equations:**\n* A + B = 160 \n* B + C = 180\n* C + D = 200\n**3.  Solve for the combined weight of Abby and Damon (A + D):**\n* **Notice:**  We need to find a way to eliminate B and C from the equations so we are left with A and D.\n* **Add all three equations together:** \n   (A + B) + (B + C) + (C + D) = 160 + 180 + 200\n   A + 2B + 2C + D = 540\n* **Simplify by combining like terms:**\n    A + D + 2(B + C) = 540\n* **Substitute:** We know B + C = 180, so substitute that in:\n    A + D + 2(180) = 540\n* **Simplify and solve for A + D:**\n    A + D + 360 = 540\n    A + D = 540 - 360\n    A + D = 180\n**Answer:** Abby and Damon weigh a total of 180 pounds together. \n",
        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Set up equations:**\n* Abby + Bart = 160\n* Bart + Cindy = 180\n* Cindy + Damon = 200\n**2.  Isolate a variable:**\nLet's isolate 'Bart' from the first equation:\n* Bart = 160 - Abby\n**3.  Substitute:**\nSubstitute the value of 'Bart' in the second equation:\n* (160 - Abby) + Cindy = 180\n* 160 - Abby + Cindy = 180\n* Cindy - Abby = 20\n**4.  Isolate another variable:**\nIsolate 'Cindy' from the third equation:\n* Cindy = 200 - Damon\n**5.  Substitute again:**\nSubstitute the value of 'Cindy' in the equation we derived in step 3:\n* (200 - Damon) - Abby = 20\n* 200 - Damon - Abby = 20\n* -Abby - Damon = -180\n**6.  Solve for Abby + Damon:**\nMultiply both sides of the equation by -1:\n* Abby + Damon = 180\n**Answer:** Abby and Damon weigh a total of 180 pounds together. \n",
        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n1. **Combine the equations:** \n   * Abby + Bart = 160\n   * Bart + Cindy = 180\n   * Cindy + Damon = 200\n2. **Notice a pattern:**  Bart appears in two equations, and Cindy appears in two equations. This means we can combine the equations to eliminate Bart and Cindy.\n3. **Add the first two equations:**\n   * (Abby + Bart) + (Bart + Cindy) = 160 + 180\n   * Abby + 2Bart + Cindy = 340\n4. **Subtract the third equation from the result:**\n   * (Abby + 2Bart + Cindy) - (Cindy + Damon) = 340 - 200\n   * Abby + 2Bart - Damon = 140\n5. **Notice another pattern:**  Bart appears twice in the equation, so we can simplify. \n   * Abby + Bart + Bart - Damon = 140\n6. **Substitute the first equation (Abby + Bart = 160):**\n   * 160 + Bart - Damon = 140\n7. **Solve for Bart - Damon:**\n   * Bart - Damon = 140 - 160\n   * Bart - Damon = -20\n8. **Since we want Abby + Damon, we need to get rid of Bart.**  Notice that (Abby + Bart) + (Damon - Bart) = Abby + Damon.\n9. **Substitute the first equation (Abby + Bart = 160) and the result from step 7 (Bart - Damon = -20):**\n   * 160 + (-20) = Abby + Damon\n10. **Simplify:**\n   * 140 = Abby + Damon\n**Therefore, Abby and Damon weigh a total of 140 pounds together.** \n",
