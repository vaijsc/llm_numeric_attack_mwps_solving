    "solution": "If we expand the left hand side of the first equation, we get $x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = 105$, so $2xy + (x^2 + y^2) = 105$. We are given that $x^2 + y^2 = 65$, so we can substitute for $x^2 + y^2$ to obtain $2xy + 65 = 105$. It follows that $xy = \\boxed{20}$.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Expand the Square:**\n*  Start with the equation $(x + y)^2 = 105$ and expand the left side: \n   *  $(x + y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = 105$\n**2. Substitute and Simplify:**\n*  We're given that  $x^2 + y^2 = 65$. Substitute this into the expanded equation:\n   *  $65 + 2xy = 105$\n**3. Solve for xy:**\n*  Subtract 65 from both sides:\n   *  $2xy = 40$\n*  Divide both sides by 2:\n   *  $xy = 20$\n**Therefore, the value of xy is 20.** \n",
