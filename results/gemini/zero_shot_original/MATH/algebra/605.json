        "Here's how to solve this step-by-step:\n1. **Factor the quadratic:**\n   The equation  $x^2 - x - 6 = 0$ factors as $(x-3)(x+2) = 0$\n2. **Find the solutions:**\n   For the product to be zero, one or both of the factors must be zero.  This gives us:\n   *  x - 3 = 0  =>  x = 3\n   *  x + 2 = 0  =>  x = -2\n3. **Calculate the product:**\n   The product of the solutions is 3 * (-2) = **-6**\n**Key Idea:**  The product of the roots of a quadratic equation of the form  $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is equal to  $c/a$. In this case,  c = -6 and a = 1, so the product of the roots is -6/1 = -6. \n",
