    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "In order for $f(x)$ to have a real number value, the expression inside the square root in the numerator must be non-negative and the denominator must not be 0. So we have the two conditions $2x-6\\ge0 \\Rightarrow x \\ge 3$ and $x-3 \\ne 0 \\Rightarrow x \\ne 3$. We see that $x=\\boxed{4}$ is the smallest integer value that satisfies both conditions.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1.  Understanding the Restrictions**\n* **Square Root:** The expression inside the square root (2x - 6) must be non-negative.\n* **Denominator:** The denominator (x - 3) cannot be zero.\n**2. Setting up Inequalities**\n* **Square Root:**  2x - 6 \u2265 0\n* **Denominator:** x - 3 \u2260 0\n**3. Solving the Inequalities**\n* **Square Root:**\n   * 2x \u2265 6\n   * x \u2265 3\n* **Denominator:**\n   * x \u2260 3\n**4. Combining the Solutions**\nWe need both conditions to be true: x \u2265 3 and x \u2260 3.  The smallest possible integer value that satisfies these conditions is x = **4**. \n**Therefore, the smallest possible integer value for x such that f(x) has a real number value is 4.** \n",
        "Here's how to find the smallest possible integer value for *x* that makes *f(x)* a real number:\n**1. Consider the square root:**\n* The expression inside the square root, 2*x* - 6, must be greater than or equal to zero to produce a real number. \n* So, we have the inequality: 2*x* - 6 \u2265 0\n**2. Solve the inequality:**\n* Add 6 to both sides: 2*x* \u2265 6\n* Divide both sides by 2: *x* \u2265 3\n**3. Consider the denominator:**\n* The denominator, *x* - 3, cannot be equal to zero because division by zero is undefined. \n* Therefore, *x* \u2260 3.\n**4. Combine the restrictions:**\n* We need *x* \u2265 3 and *x* \u2260 3.  This means *x* must be strictly greater than 3.\n**5. The smallest possible integer:**\n* The smallest integer that satisfies *x* > 3 is **x = 4**.\n**Therefore, the smallest possible integer value for *x* such that *f(x)* has a real number value is 4.** \n",
