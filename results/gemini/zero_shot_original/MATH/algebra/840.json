    "problem": "Three pencils and a jumbo eraser cost $\\$1.24$. Five pencils and a jumbo eraser cost $\\$1.82$. No prices include tax. In cents, what is the cost of a pencil?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Call the price of a pencil $p$ and the price of a jumbo eraser $e$, in terms of cents. We can use the following system of equations to represent the information given: \\begin{align*}\n3p + e &= 124 \\\\\n5p + e &= 182 \\\\\n\\end{align*} Subtracting the first equation from the second gives $2p = 58$, or $p = 29$. Thus, the cost of a pencil is $\\boxed{29}$ cents.",

        "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n**1. Set up equations:**\n* Let 'x' represent the cost of a pencil in cents.\n* Let 'y' represent the cost of a jumbo eraser in cents.\nWe can set up two equations based on the given information:\n* Equation 1: 3x + y = 124  (Since $1.24 is equal to 124 cents)\n* Equation 2: 5x + y = 182  (Since $1.82 is equal to 182 cents)\n**2. Solve for 'y' in terms of 'x':**\n*  Subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2: \n   (5x + y) - (3x + y) = 182 - 124\n*  Simplify: 2x = 58\n*  Solve for 'x': x = 29\n**Answer:** The cost of a pencil is **29 cents**. \n",
