        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Understand Absolute Value**\nThe absolute value of a number is its distance from zero, always represented as a positive number. So,  |4x + 2| = 10 means:\n*  4x + 2 = 10 \n* OR \n* 4x + 2 = -10\n**2. Solve for x in both cases**\n* **Case 1: 4x + 2 = 10**\n   * Subtract 2 from both sides: 4x = 8\n   * Divide both sides by 4: x = 2\n* **Case 2: 4x + 2 = -10**\n   * Subtract 2 from both sides: 4x = -12\n   * Divide both sides by 4: x = -3\n**3. Apply the Restriction**\nThe problem states that x < 0.  Therefore, the solution x = 2 is not valid. \n**4. Final Answer**\nThe value of x that satisfies the equation and the restriction is **x = -3**. \n",
