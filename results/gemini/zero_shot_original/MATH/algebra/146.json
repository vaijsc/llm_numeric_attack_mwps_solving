    "solution": "If seven pens costs $\\$9.24$, then each pen costs $\\frac{924}{7}=132$ cents. Now we can multiply ratios to find the cost of one pencil. $$\\frac{11\\text{ pencils}}{3 \\text{ pens}}\\times\\frac{1\\text{ pen}}{132\\text{ cents}}=\\frac{11}{132\\times3}=\\frac{1}{12\\times3}=\\frac{1 \\text{ pencil}}{36 \\text{ cents}}$$ The ratio is $1$ pencil to $36$ cents, so a pencil costs $\\boxed{36}$ cents.",

        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n**1. Find the cost of one pen:**\n* If 7 pens cost $9.24, then one pen costs $9.24 / 7 = $1.32.\n**2. Find the cost of three pens:**\n* Since one pen costs $1.32, three pens cost $1.32 * 3 = $3.96.\n**3. Find the cost of one pencil:**\n* Eleven pencils cost the same as three pens, which is $3.96.\n* Therefore, one pencil costs $3.96 / 11 = $0.36.\n**4. Convert to cents:**\n* Since $1 is equal to 100 cents, $0.36 is equal to 0.36 * 100 = **36 cents**.\n**Answer:** One pencil costs **36 cents**. \n",
