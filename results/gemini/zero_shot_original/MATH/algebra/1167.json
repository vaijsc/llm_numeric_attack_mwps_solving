        "Here's how to solve for the value of 'a':\n**1. Simplify the equations using logarithmic properties:**\nRecall that:\n*  log(x) - log(y) = log(x/y)\nUsing this property, we can rewrite the given equations:\n*  log(x/y) = a \n*  log(y/z) = 15\n*  log(z/x) = -7\n**2. Combine the equations to eliminate y and z:**\nNotice that if we add the first and third equations, we get:\nlog(x/y) + log(z/x) = a - 7\nUsing the property log(a) + log(b) = log(a * b), we get:\nlog[(x/y) * (z/x)] = a - 7\nSimplifying, we get:\nlog(z/y) = a - 7\n**3. Substitute the value of log(y/z) from the second equation:**\nWe know log(y/z) = 15.  Therefore:\n15 = a - 7\n**4. Solve for a:**\nAdding 7 to both sides, we get:\na = 22\n**Therefore, the value of 'a' is 22.** \n",
        "Here's how we can solve for *a* step-by-step:\n**1. Combine the equations:**\nNotice that the equations involve differences of logarithms.  We can use the following logarithmic property:\n*  **log (a) - log (b) = log (a/b)**\nApplying this to our equations:\n* Equation 1:  log (x/y) = *a*\n* Equation 2:  log (y/z) = 15\n* Equation 3:  log (z/x) = -7\n**2.  Recognize the cyclical relationship:**\nNotice that the arguments of the logarithms form a cycle: x/y, y/z, z/x.  Let's multiply these expressions together:\n(x/y) * (y/z) * (z/x) = 1\nThis simplifies to 1 = 1, which is always true.\n**3.  Solve for *a*:**\nSince the equations are consistent, we can add them together:\n* log (x/y) + log (y/z) + log (z/x) = *a* + 15 - 7\nUsing the property log (a) + log (b) = log (a * b), we get:\n* log [(x/y) * (y/z) * (z/x)] = *a* + 8\nWe already know that (x/y) * (y/z) * (z/x) = 1, so:\n* log (1) = *a* + 8\nSince log (1) = 0, we have:\n* 0 = *a* + 8\n**4. Final Solution:**\nSolving for *a*, we get:\n* **a = -8** \n",
