        "Here's how to solve this problem:\n**Understanding the Pattern**\nThe expression represents a continued fraction. Notice that the pattern repeats:  the denominator of each fraction is  \"1 + (the same continued fraction)\".\n**Setting up an Equation**\nSince the pattern continues infinitely, we can represent the entire expression by itself:\nLet  \n  *  $y = 1 + \\frac{x}{1 + \\frac{x}{1+ \\frac{x}{1 + \\cdots}}}$\nThis means: \n  *  $y = 1 + \\frac{x}{y}$\n**Solving for x**\n1. **Multiply both sides by y:** \n   *  $y^2 = y + x$\n2. **Rearrange into a quadratic equation:**\n   *  $y^2 - y - x = 0$\n3. **Use the quadratic formula to solve for y:**\n   *  $y = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 4x}}{2}$\n4. **Substitute back x for y:**\n   *  $x = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 4x}}{2}$\n5. **Solve for x:**\n   *  $2x = 1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 4x}$\n   *  $4x^2 = 1 \\pm 2\\sqrt{1 + 4x} + 1 + 4x$\n   *  $4x^2 - 4x - 2 = \\pm 2\\sqrt{1 + 4x}$ \n   *  Square both sides:  $16x^4 - 32x^3 + 16x^2 - 16x - 8 = 4 + 16x$\n   *  Simplify:  $16x^4 - 32x^3 + 16x^2 - 32x - 12 = 0$ \n6. **Divide by 4:**  $4x^4 - 8x^3 + 4x^2 - 8x - 3 = 0$\n7. **Factor by grouping:**\n   *  $(4x^4 - 8x^3) + (4x^2 - 8x) - 3 = 0$\n   *  $4x^3(x - 2) + 4x(x - 2) - 3 = 0$\n8. **Notice that (x - 2) is a common factor:** \n   *  $(x-2)(4x^3 + 4x - 3) = 0$\n9.  The equation $(4x^3 + 4x - 3) = 0$ has one real solution, which can be found numerically (it's approximately x \u2248 0.682).\n**Therefore, the solutions for x are:**\n*  **x = 2**  (from the factor (x - 2) = 0)\n*  **x \u2248 0.682** (from the factor  (4x^3 + 4x - 3) = 0) \n",
