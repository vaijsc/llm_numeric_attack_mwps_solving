        "To solve the given system of equations for \\( c \\), we start by rewriting the equations:\n1. \\( a - b = 2(c + d) \\)\n2. \\( b = a - 2 \\)\n3. \\( d = c + 5 \\)\nFirst, we substitute equation 2 into equation 1. Substituting \\( b = a - 2 \\) into equation 1 gives us:\n\\[\na - (a - 2) = 2(c + d)\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n2 = 2(c + d)\n\\]\nDividing both sides by 2:\n\\[\n1 = c + d\n\\]\nNow, we have a new equation:\n\\[\nc + d = 1 \\quad \\text{(Equation 4)}\n\\]\nNext, we can use equation 3 which states \\( d = c + 5 \\). We substitute this expression for \\( d \\) into equation 4:\n\\[\nc + (c + 5) = 1\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n2c + 5 = 1\n\\]\nNow, we solve for \\( c \\):\n1. Subtract 5 from both sides:\n\\[\n2c = 1 - 5\n\\]\n\\[\n2c = -4\n\\]\n2. Divide by 2:\n\\[\nc = -2\n\\]\nThus, the solution for \\( c \\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{-2}\n\\]\n### Verification\nTo verify that \\( c = -2 \\) is correct, we calculate \\( d \\) using equation 3:\n\\[\nd = c + 5 = -2 + 5 = 3\n\\]\nAlso, using equation 2 to find \\( b \\). We can express \\( a \\) in terms of \\( b \\):\nFrom equation 1, \\( a - b = 2(c + d) \\):\nSubstituting \\( c = -2 \\) and \\( d = 3 \\):\n\\[\na - b = 2(-2 + 3) = 2 \\times 1 = 2\n\\]\nUsing equation 2, \\( b = a - 2 \\):\nSubstituting \\( b \\) back into \\( a - b = 2 \\) gives us:\n\\[\na - (a - 2) = 2\n\\]\nThis is true:\n\\[\n2 = 2\n\\]\nNow again check \\( a \\) through equations. Using \\( b = a - 2 \\):\nLet\u2019s say \\( b = k \\), we then have \\( a = k + 2 \\):\nFrom \\( c + d = 1\\), substituting again \\( d = 3\\) gives:\n\\[\nc + 3 = 1\n\\]\nThis checks as \\( c = -2\\). \nAll checks confirm that our solution for \\( c \\) is correct:\n\\(\\boxed{-2}\\) is indeed the valid and verified answer.",
        "We start with the system of equations:\n1. \\( a - b = 2(c + d) \\) \n2. \\( b = a - 2 \\)\n3. \\( d = c + 5 \\)\nFirst, we will substitute \\( b \\) from the second equation into the first equation. \nSubstituting \\( b = a - 2 \\) into the first equation:\n\\[\na - (a - 2) = 2(c + d)\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n2 = 2(c + d)\n\\]\nNow, we divide both sides by 2:\n\\[\n1 = c + d\n\\]\nNext, we substitute \\( d \\) from the third equation into this equation. We know \\( d = c + 5 \\), so substituting gives:\n\\[\n1 = c + (c + 5)\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n1 = 2c + 5\n\\]\nNow, we isolate \\( c \\) by first subtracting 5 from both sides:\n\\[\n1 - 5 = 2c\n\\]\nThis results in:\n\\[\n-4 = 2c\n\\]\nNext, we divide by 2:\n\\[\nc = -2\n\\]\nNow, we have \\( c = -2 \\).

Now, we find \\( b \\) using the second equation. \nTo find \\( a \\), we first express \\( b \\):\nIf \\( b = a - 2 \\), we can express \\( a \\) in terms of \\( b \\):\n\\[\na = b + 2\n\\]\nNow substituting into the first equation \\( a - b = 2(c + d) \\):\n\\[\n(b + 2) - b = 2(-2 + 3)\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n2 = 2 \\cdot 1\n\\]\nThis is true, confirming our calculations. \nNow we have verified our found values:\n- \\( c = -2 \\)\n- \\( d = 3 \\)\n- \\( b = a - 2 \\)\n- The relation provides a necessary confirmation, leaving us with \\( c = -2 \\).\nThus, the solution for \\( c \\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{-2}\n\\]",
