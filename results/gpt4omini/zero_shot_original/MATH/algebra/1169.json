        "To simplify the expression \\((9x^2 + 3x + 7) + (3x^2 + 7x^5 + 2)\\), we will first combine like terms. \n1. Start by rewriting the expression:\n   \\[\n   9x^2 + 3x + 7 + 3x^2 + 7x^5 + 2\n   \\]\n2. Now, let's rearrange and group the terms by their degrees:\n   \\[\n   7x^5 + (9x^2 + 3x^2) + 3x + (7 + 2)\n   \\]\n3. Combine the like terms:\n   - For the \\(x^5\\) term: \\(7x^5\\)\n   - For the \\(x^2\\) terms: \\(9x^2 + 3x^2 = 12x^2\\)\n   - For the \\(x\\) term: \\(3x\\) (remains the same)\n   - For the constant terms: \\(7 + 2 = 9\\)\n4.
