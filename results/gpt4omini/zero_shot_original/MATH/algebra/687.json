        "To determine the smallest integer \\( x \\) for which the expression \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{x^2+x-6} \\) is defined, we need to analyze both the numerator and denominator separately.\n**Step 1: Denominator Analysis**\nThe denominator is given by \\( x^2 + x - 6 \\). We need to ensure this denominator is not equal to zero. We can find the values of \\( x \\) for which \\( x^2 + x - 6 = 0 \\) by factoring the quadratic expression.\nTo factor:\n\\[\nx^2 + x - 6 = (x - 2)(x + 3)\n\\]\nSetting this equal to zero, we have:\n\\[\n(x - 2)(x + 3) = 0\n\\]\nThis gives us the roots:\n\\[\nx - 2 = 0 \\implies x = 2\n\\]\n\\[\nx + 3 = 0 \\implies x = -3\n\\]\nThus, the denominator \\( x^2 + x - 6 \\) is zero at \\( x = 2 \\) and \\( x = -3 \\). We need to avoid these values.\n**Step 2: Numerator Analysis**\nThe numerator is \\( \\sqrt{x - 2} \\). The square root function \\( \\sqrt{x - 2} \\) requires that \\( x - 2 \\geq 0 \\) in order to be defined. Thus,\n\\[\nx - 2 \\geq 0 \\implies x \\geq 2.\n\\]\n**Step 3: Combine Conditions**\nFrom the numerator, we found that \\( x \\) must be \\( \\geq 2 \\) for \\( \\sqrt{x - 2} \\) to be defined. From the denominator, we discovered that \\( x \\) cannot be 2 or -3. \nFrom the condition \\( x \\geq 2 \\), we see:\n1. \\( x = 2 \\) is not allowed (denominator becomes zero).\n2. The next integer greater than 2 is \\( x = 3 \\).\n**Step 4: Final Check**\nFor \\( x = 3 \\):\n- The denominator:\n\\[\nx^2 + x - 6 = 3^2 + 3 - 6 = 9 + 3 - 6 = 6 \\quad (\\text{not zero})\n\\]\n- The numerator:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{x - 2} = \\sqrt{3 - 2} = \\sqrt{1} = 1 \\quad (\\text{defined})\n\\]\nThus, \\( x = 3 \\) satisfies both conditions.\nTherefore, the smallest integer \\( x \\) for which the expression \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{x^2+x-6} \\) is defined is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{3}\n\\]",

We need to exclude these points from our possible values of \\( x \\).\n### Step 3: Combine the conditions\nFrom the two conditions:\n- From the square root, we have \\( x \\geq 2 \\).\n- From the denominator, \\( x = 2 \\) cannot be included.\nThe smallest integer \\( x \\) that satisfies \\( x \\geq 2 \\) and is not equal to 2 is:\n\\[\nx = 3\n\\]\n### Conclusion\nThus, the smallest integer \\( x \\) for which the expression \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{x^2+x-6} \\) is defined is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{3}\n\\]",
