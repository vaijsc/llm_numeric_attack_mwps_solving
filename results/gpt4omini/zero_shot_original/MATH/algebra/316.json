        "To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given expressions. The first quadratic is \\( 16x^2 + 36x + 56 \\), and we want to express this in a form that makes it clear how its constant term relates to another quadratic, \\( (mx+n)^2 \\).\n1. **Identify the constant terms in both quadratics**: \n   The quadratic \\( 16x^2 + 36x + 56 \\) has a constant term of \\( 56 \\).\n2. **Write down the form of the second quadratic**: \n   The quadratic \\( (mx+n)^2 \\) expands to:\n   \\[\n   (mx+n)^2 = m^2x^2 + 2mnx + n^2\n   \\]\n   So, the constant term here is \\( n^2 \\).\n3. **Set up the condition from the problem statement**:\n   According to the problem, the quadratics differ only in their constant term, which means:\n   \\[\n   16x^2 + 36x + 56 = m^2x^2 + 2mnx + n^2\n   \\]\n   From this, we can equate the coefficients of \\( x^2 \\), \\( x \\), and the constant terms of both sides:\n   - For \\( x^2 \\): \n     \\[\n     16 = m^2\n     \\]\n   - For \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     36 = 2mn\n     \\]\n   - For the constant terms: \n     \\[\n     56 = n^2\n     \\]\n4. **Solve for \\( m \\)**: \n   From \\( 16 = m^2 \\), we take the positive root (as \\( m \\) is a positive number):\n   \\[\n   m = 4\n   \\]\n5. **Solve for \\( n \\)**: \n   From \\( 56 = n^2 \\), we take the positive root:\n   \\[\n   n = \\sqrt{56} = \\sqrt{4 \\cdot 14} = 2\\sqrt{14}\n   \\]\n6. **Substitute \\( m \\) into the equation for \\( n \\)**:\n   Now that we have \\( m \\), substitute \\( m = 4 \\) into the second equation \\( 36 = 2mn \\):\n   \\[\n   36 = 2 \\cdot 4 \\cdot n\n   \\]\n   Simplifying gives:\n   \\[\n   36 = 8n\n   \\]\n   Therefore:\n   \\[\n   n = \\frac{36}{8} = \\frac{9}{2}\n   \\]\n7. **Check \\( n \\)**: \n   We previously found \\( n = 2\\sqrt{14} \\), but from the above, we found \\( n = \\frac{9}{2} \\).
