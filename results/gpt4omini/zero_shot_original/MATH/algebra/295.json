        "To determine how much money the man needs to invest now to have at least $100,000 in five years with an annual compounding interest rate of 6%, we will use the formula for compound interest:\n\\[\nA = P(1 + r)^t\n\\]\nwhere:\n- \\( A \\) is the future value of the investment/loan, including interest ($100,000),\n- \\( P \\) is the principal investment amount (the initial deposit or loan amount),\n- \\( r \\) is the annual interest rate (decimal),\n- \\( t \\) is the number of years the money is invested or borrowed.\nIn this case, we need to solve for \\( P \\):\n1.
