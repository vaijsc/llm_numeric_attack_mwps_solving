    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "From 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. there are 9 hours. In each hour, there are 3 tours (every 20 minutes). Thus, in 9 hours, there are $9 \\cdot 3 = 27$ tours. Don't forget to count the last tour at 6 p.m., so there are $\\boxed{28}$ tours total per day.",

        "To determine the number of tours conducted per day at Luray Caverns, we need to follow these steps:\n1. **Identify the time range for tour availability**: The first tour starts at 9 a.m. and the last tour begins at 6 p.m.\n2. **Convert times to a 24-hour format**: \n   - 9 a.m. is 09:00.\n   - 6 p.m. is 18:00.\n3. **Calculate the total minutes from the start of the first tour to the start of the last tour**:\n   - From 9:00 to 18:00, we have:\n     - 9:00 to 12:00 is 3 hours (3 \u00d7 60 = 180 minutes).\n     - 12:00 to 18:00 is 6 hours (6 \u00d7 60 = 360 minutes).\n   - Adding these gives us: \n     180 minutes + 360 minutes = 540 minutes.\n4. **Determine the number of tours in this time interval**:\n   - Since tours occur every 20 minutes, we divide the total minutes by the interval between tours:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of tours} = \\frac{540 \\text{ minutes}}{20 \\text{ minutes/tour}} = 27 \\text{ tours}.\n   \\]\n5. **Include the initial tour**: \n   - The first tour at 9 a.m. counts as one of the tours, and each 20-minute interval thereafter continues until the last tour starts.\n   - Thus, there are a total of 27 tours in a day.\nHence, the total number of tours conducted each day in April at Luray Caverns is **27**.",
        "To determine how many tours occur each day at Luray Caverns, we need to calculate the total number of tours that can start from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., given that tours are conducted every 20 minutes.\n1. **Determine the operating hours:**\n   - The first tour starts at 9 a.m.\n   - The last tour starts at 6 p.m.\n2. **Convert the starting and ending times to minutes:**\n   - 9 a.m. is 0 minutes after midnight.\n   - 6 p.m. is 18:00, which is \\( 18 \\times 60 = 1080 \\) minutes after midnight.\n3. **Calculate the total duration of operation:**\n   - The duration from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. is:\n     \\[\n     1080 \\text{ minutes} - 0 \\text{ minutes} = 1080 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n4. **Calculate the number of tours:**\n   - Since tours are every 20 minutes, we can determine the number of tours by dividing the total minutes by the duration of each tour:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1080 \\text{ minutes}}{20 \\text{ minutes/tour}} = 54 \\text{ tours}\n     \\]\n5. **Confirm the schedule:**\n   - The tours run exactly every 20 minutes starting at 9:00 a.m. (9:00, 9:20, 9:40, ..., last tour starting at 6:00 p.m.).\n   - The last tour that begins at 6:00 p.m. fits because:\n     - The next possible tour time would be 6:20 p.m., which is after the closing time.\nThis confirms that the operation is consistent with the schedule.\n6. **Final Count:**\n   - There are **54 tours** conducted each day in April at Luray Caverns. \nThus, the final answer is **54 tours per day**.",
        "To calculate the number of tours per day in April at Luray Caverns, we first need to determine the time interval from the first tour at 9 a.m. to the last tour at 6 p.m.\n1. **Determine the time period:**\n   - The first tour starts at 9:00 a.m. \n   - The last tour starts at 6:00 p.m.\n2. **Convert the times to a 24-hour clock for easier calculation:**\n   - 9:00 a.m. is 09:00.\n   - 6:00 p.m. is 18:00.\n3. **Calculate the total duration from 9:00 to 18:00:**\n   - Duration = 18:00 - 09:00 = 9 hours.\n4. **Convert the duration into minutes:**\n   - 9 hours \u00d7 60 minutes/hour = 540 minutes.\n5. **Determine how many tours are conducted in that timeframe:**\n   - Since tours are conducted every 20 minutes, we divide the total minutes by the duration of each tour.\n   - Number of tours = Total minutes / Duration of each tour = 540 minutes / 20 minutes = 27.\n6. **Count the first tour:**\n   - The first tour at 9:00 a.m. counts as the first tour, and the 27th tour occurs at 5:40 p.m.\n   - Therefore, we have a total of 27 tours each day.\nConsequently, the total number of tours per day in April is **27 tours**.",
        "To find out how many tours occur each day at the Luray Caverns in Virginia, we can follow these steps:\n1. **Determine the tour schedule:**\n   - The first tour starts at 9:00 AM.\n   - The last tour starts at 6:00 PM.\n2. **Calculate the number of hours from the first tour to the last tour:**\n   - From 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM is a total of 9 hours (from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM is 3 hours, from 12:00 PM to 6:00 PM is 6 hours, giving 3 + 6 = 9 hours).\n3. **Convert hours into minutes:**\n   - 9 hours is equal to \\( 9 \\times 60 = 540 \\) minutes.\n4. **Calculate the number of 20-minute intervals in 540 minutes:**\n   - To find how many tours can be conducted in the 540 minutes, we divide 540 by 20:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Number of tours} = \\frac{540}{20} = 27.\n     \\]\n5. **Include the first tour:**\n   - Since the calculation gives us the number of intervals or gaps between tours (not counting the first tour), we need to add the first tour to the count:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total tours} = 27 + 1 = 28.\n     \\]\nTherefore, the total number of tours conducted each day in April is **28**.",
        "To calculate the total number of tours conducted each day in April at the Luray Caverns, we can follow these steps:\n1. **Identify the Start and End Times**: \n   - The first tour starts at 9:00 a.m.\n   - The last tour starts at 6:00 p.m.\n2. **Convert Times to a 24-Hour Format**:\n   - 9:00 a.m. is 09:00.\n   - 6:00 p.m. is 18:00.\n3. **Calculate the Total Hours Available for Tours**:\n   - From 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. is a span of 9 hours.\n4. **Determine the Number of Tours in One Hour**:\n   - Since tours are conducted every 20 minutes, we can calculate how many tours fit into one hour:\n     - There are 60 minutes in an hour.\n     - Each tour lasts 20 minutes, so:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Number of tours per hour} = \\frac{60 \\text{ minutes}}{20 \\text{ minutes/tour}} = 3 \\text{ tours/hour}\n     \\]\n5. **Calculate the Total Number of Tours for the Day**:\n   - Since we have a 9-hour window, we calculate the total number of tours in a day:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total tours} = 3 \\text{ tours/hour} \\times 9 \\text{ hours} = 27 \\text{ tours}\n   \\]\nThus, the Luray Caverns conducts **27 tours per day in April**."
