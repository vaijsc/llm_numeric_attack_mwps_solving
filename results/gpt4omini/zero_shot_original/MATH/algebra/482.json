        "To solve the equation \\( x^2 + 18x - 9 = 0 \\) by completing the square, we'll follow these steps:\n1. **Rearrange the equation**: Move the constant term to the other side:\n   \\[\n   x^2 + 18x = 9.\n   \\]\n2. **Complete the square**: We need to turn the left side into a perfect square trinomial. To do that, we take half of the coefficient of \\( x \\) (which is \\( 18 \\)), square it, and add it to both sides.\n   - Half of \\( 18 \\) is \\( 9 \\).\n   - Squaring \\( 9 \\) gives \\( 81 \\).\n   Now, we add \\( 81 \\) to both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   x^2 + 18x + 81 = 9 + 81.\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   x^2 + 18x + 81 = 90.\n   \\]\n3. **Rewrite the left side as a square**: The left side is now a perfect square:\n   \\[\n   (x + 9)^2 = 90.\n   \\]\nHere, from this form \\( (x + b)^2 = c \\), we identify:\n- \\( b = 9 \\)\n- \\( c = 90 \\)\nThus, the value of \\( c \\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{90}.\n\\]",
