    "problem": "Five people can mow a lawn in 12 hours.  How many more people are needed to mow the lawn in just 3 hours, assuming each person mows at the same rate?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The number of people mowing and the time required to mow are inversely proportional. Letting $n$ be the number of people and $t$ be the amount of time, we have $nt = (5)(12)= 60$ because 5 people can mow a lawn in 12 hours. If $m$ people can mow the lawn in 3 hours, then we must have $m(3) = 60$, so $m=20$.  Therefore, we need to add $20-5 = \\boxed{15}$ people to the job.",

        "To solve the problem, we need to find out how many people are required to mow the lawn in 3 hours, given that 5 people can do it in 12 hours.\n1. **Calculate the total work in terms of person-hours:**\n   The total work done to mow the lawn can be calculated by multiplying the number of people by the time they take. For 5 people working for 12 hours:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total work} = 5 \\text{ people} \\times 12 \\text{ hours} = 60 \\text{ person-hours}\n   \\]\n2. **Determine the required number of people to complete the work in 3 hours:**\n   Let \\( x \\) be the number of people needed to complete the same work in 3 hours. The equation for the total work done in terms of \\( x \\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total work} = x \\text{ people} \\times 3 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n   Setting this equal to the total work calculated earlier:\n   \\[\n   x \\times 3 = 60\n   \\]\n3. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   To find \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{60}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n4. **Calculate how many more people are needed:**\n   Initially, there are 5 people. To find how many more people are needed:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Additional people required} = x - 5 = 20 - 5 = 15\n   \\]\n### Conclusion:\n15 more people are needed to mow the lawn in just 3 hours.",
        "To determine how many more people are needed to mow the lawn in just 3 hours, we can break this problem down step by step.\n1. **Calculate the total mowing time in person-hours for the original situation**:\n    - If 5 people can mow the lawn in 12 hours, we can find the total amount of work being done in person-hours.\n    - Total person-hours = Number of people \u00d7 Time = 5 people \u00d7 12 hours = 60 person-hours.\n2. **Calculate how many people are needed to do the same amount of work in 3 hours**:\n    - Now we want to determine how many people are needed to complete the same 60 person-hours of work in just 3 hours.\n    - Let \\( x \\) be the number of people required.\n    - We have the equation: \\( x \\text{ people} \\times 3 \\text{ hours} = 60 \\text{ person-hours} \\).\n    \n    Rearranging gives us:\n    \\[\n    x = \\frac{60 \\text{ person-hours}}{3 \\text{ hours}} = 20 \\text{ people}.\n    \\]\n3. **Determine how many more people are needed**:\n    - We originally had 5 people and now we need 20 people.\n    - The difference gives the additional people needed:\n    \\[\n    20 \\text{ people} - 5 \\text{ people} = 15 \\text{ more people}.\n    \\]\nThus, the number of additional people needed to mow the lawn in just 3 hours is **15**.",
        "To solve the problem, we can start by determining the total amount of work required to mow the lawn in terms of person-hours.\n1. **Calculate the total work done in person-hours:**\n   - If 5 people can mow the lawn in 12 hours, the total work (W) is:\n     \\[\n     W = \\text{Number of people} \\times \\text{Time} = 5 \\text{ people} \\times 12 \\text{ hours} = 60 \\text{ person-hours}\n     \\]\n2. **Determine how much work is needed for 3 hours:**\n   - If we want to mow the lawn in 3 hours, let's denote the number of people needed as \\( x \\). The total work done by \\( x \\) people in 3 hours is:\n     \\[\n     W = x \\text{ people} \\times 3 \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n   - To find \\( x \\), we set this equal to the total work calculated earlier (60 person-hours):\n     \\[\n     x \\times 3 = 60\n     \\]\n3. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{60}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n   This means 20 people are needed to mow the lawn in 3 hours.\n4. **Calculate how many more people are needed:**\n   - We started with 5 people and now we need 20 people, so the number of additional people required is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Additional people} = 20 - 5 = 15\n     \\]\n### Final Answer:\n**15 more people are needed** to mow the lawn in just 3 hours.",
