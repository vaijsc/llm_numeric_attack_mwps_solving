        "To find the 5th term of the geometric sequence, let's denote the first term as \\( a \\) and the common ratio as \\( r \\).\n1. **Identify the first term**: \n   The first term \\( a = 7 \\).\n2. **Write the formula for the nth term**: \n   The nth term of a geometric sequence can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   a_n = a \\cdot r^{n-1}\n   \\]\n3. **Find the 7th term**:\n   We know the 7th term is given as 5103.

        "To find the 5th term of a geometric sequence where the first term is \\( a_1 = 7 \\) and the 7th term is \\( a_7 = 5103 \\), we follow these steps:\n1. The formula for the \\( n \\)-th term of a geometric sequence is given by:\n   \\[\n   a_n = a_1 \\cdot r^{n-1}\n   \\]\n   where \\( a_1 \\) is the first term, \\( r \\) is the common ratio, and \\( n \\) is the term number.\n2. We know:\n   - \\( a_1 = 7 \\)\n   - \\( a_7 = 5103 \\)\n3. Using the formula for the 7th term, we can substitute values:\n   \\[\n   a_7 = a_1 \\cdot r^{7-1}\n   \\]\n   This gives us:\n   \\[\n   5103 = 7 \\cdot r^{6}\n   \\]\n4. To solve for \\( r^{6} \\), we divide both sides by 7:\n   \\[\n   r^{6} = \\frac{5103}{7}\n   \\]\n   Doing the division:\n   \\[\n   r^{6} = 729\n   \\]\n5. Now, we need to find the common ratio \\( r \\). We take the sixth root of both sides:\n   \\[\n   r = 729^{1/6}\n   \\]\n6. The value of \\( 729 \\) can be expressed as \\( 3^6 \\):\n   \\[\n   r = (3^6)^{1/6} = 3\n   \\]\n7.
