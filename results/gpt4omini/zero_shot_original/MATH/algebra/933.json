        "To solve the equation \\( |x-4| - 10 = 2 \\), we start by isolating the absolute value expression. \n1. Add 10 to both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   |x-4| - 10 + 10 = 2 + 10\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   |x-4| = 12\n   \\]\nNow we will solve the absolute value equation \\( |x-4| = 12 \\).\n2. The definition of absolute value gives us two cases to consider:\n   - Case 1: \n     \\[\n     x - 4 = 12\n     \\]\n   - Case 2: \n     \\[\n     x - 4 = -12\n     \\]\n3. We will solve each case separately.\n   For Case 1:\n   \\[\n   x - 4 = 12 \\implies x = 12 + 4 = 16\n   \\]\n   For Case 2:\n   \\[\n   x - 4 = -12 \\implies x = -12 + 4 = -8\n   \\]\nThus, we have found the two possible values of \\( x \\):\n- \\( x = 16 \\)\n- \\( x = -8 \\)\n4.
