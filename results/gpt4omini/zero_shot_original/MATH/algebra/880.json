        "Let's start by identifying the coordinates of the point \\((x, y)\\) given the information provided. Since the point is located in the fourth quadrant (both coordinates are negative), we can denote:\n- \\( y = -6 \\) (because the distance from the \\(x\\)-axis is 6 units and both coordinates are negative).\nNow we need to determine \\(x\\). We know that the distance from the point \\((x, -6)\\) to the point \\((8, 3)\\) is 15 units. We can use the distance formula for this purpose:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(x - 8)^2 + (-6 - 3)^2} = 15\n\\]\nCalculating \\(-6 - 3\\):\n\\[\n-6 - 3 = -9\n\\]\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(x - 8)^2 + (-9)^2} = 15\n\\]\nSquaring both sides yields:\n\\[\n(x - 8)^2 + 81 = 225\n\\]\nSubtracting 81 from both sides gives:\n\\[\n(x - 8)^2 = 144\n\\]\nTaking the square root of both sides, we have two possible equations:\n\\[\nx - 8 = 12 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x - 8 = -12\n\\]\nSolving these:\n1. For \\(x - 8 = 12\\):\n\\[\nx = 20\n\\]\n2. For \\(x - 8 = -12\\):\n\\[\nx = -4\n\\]\nSince we require \\(x\\) to be negative, we choose \\(x = -4\\). Thus, the coordinates of the point are \\((-4, -6)\\).\nNext, we need to find the distance from the origin \\((0, 0)\\) to the point \\((-4, -6)\\). Using the distance formula:\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{(-4 - 0)^2 + (-6 - 0)^2}\n\\]\nCalculating this:\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{(-4)^2 + (-6)^2} = \\sqrt{16 + 36} = \\sqrt{52}\n\\]\nSince the problem states the distance is \\(\\sqrt{n}\\), we set:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{n} = \\sqrt{52}\n\\]\nSquaring both sides gives:\n\\[\nn = 52\n\\]\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{52}\n\\]",
        "We start with the information given in the problem. We are looking for a point \\((x, y)\\) in the third quadrant, where both coordinates are negative. \n1. **Distance from the \\(x\\)-axis:**\n   The distance of a point from the \\(x\\)-axis is determined by the absolute value of its \\(y\\)-coordinate.
