        "To factor the expression \\( r^2 + 10r + 25 \\), we can follow these steps:\n1. **Identify the form**: The expression looks like a quadratic in the standard form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), where \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 10 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n2. **Look for a perfect square**: We can check if this quadratic is a perfect square trinomial. A perfect square trinomial can be written in the form \\( (x + p)^2 = x^2 + 2px + p^2 \\).\n3. **Compare coefficients**: Here, we have:\n   - \\( b = 10 \\) which should equal \\( 2p \\) (where \\( p \\) is the number we need).\n   - This gives us \\( 2p = 10 \\) \u2192 \\( p = 5 \\).\n4. **Calculate \\( p^2 \\)**: Now we also need to check \\( p^2 \\):\n   - \\( p^2 = 5^2 = 25 \\), which matches the constant term of our quadratic \\( c = 25 \\).\n5. **Write the factorization**: Since both conditions are met, we can express the quadratic as:\n   \\[\n   (r + 5)^2\n   \\]\nThus, the factored form of \\( r^2 + 10r + 25 \\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{(r + 5)^2}\n\\]",
