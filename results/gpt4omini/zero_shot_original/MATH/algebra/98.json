        "To determine which of the four points does not lie on the same line as the others, we can use the concept of slopes. The slope between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is calculated using the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{slope} = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\n\\]\nTo compare the slopes, we can choose three points at a time, find the slope between the first two points, and then compare it to the slope between the first point and the third point. If the slopes match, then all three points are collinear. If not, at least one of the points is not on the same line.\nLet's label the points:\n- \\(A = (2, 2)\\)\n- \\(B = (9, 11)\\)\n- \\(C = (5, 7)\\)\n- \\(D = (11, 17)\\)\nWe'll check whether points \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) are collinear first.\n1.

Calculate the slope between \\(A\\) and \\(C\\):\n   \\[\n   \\text{slope}_{AC} = \\frac{7 - 2}{5 - 2} = \\frac{5}{3}\n   \\]\nSince \\(\\frac{9}{7} \\neq \\frac{5}{3}\\), points \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) are not collinear. Now let's test if \\(C\\) and \\(D\\) are collinear with \\(A\\).\n3. Now, we check if \\(A\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) are collinear:\n4. Calculate the slope between \\(A\\) and \\(D\\):\n   \\[\n   \\text{slope}_{AD} = \\frac{17 - 2}{11 - 2} = \\frac{15}{9} = \\frac{5}{3}\n   \\]\nNow we check if \\(C\\) and \\(D\\) are collinear:\n5. Calculate the slope between \\(C\\) and \\(D\\):\n   \\[\n   \\text{slope}_{CD} = \\frac{17 - 7}{11 - 5} = \\frac{10}{6} = \\frac{5}{3}\n   \\]\nSince the slopes between \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) match the slope between \\(A\\) and \\(D\\), points \\(A\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) are collinear.\nFinally, since \\(B\\) is the only point that does not match the slopes, we conclude that point \\(B\\) is the one which does not lie on the same line as the others.\nThus, the point that is not on the line is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{(9, 11)}\n\\]",
