    "solution": "For the simple interest rate, she would have to pay an interest of $10000 \\cdot 0.07=700$ dollars every year. Since there are $5$ years, in the end she would have to pay back $10000+5\\cdot 700=13500$ dollars.\n\nFor the compounded interest, her balance is multiplied by $1+6\\%=1.06$ each year. Therefore, at the end of 5 years her balance is $A=10000(1+0.06)^5=13382.255..$.\n\nThe simple interest rate would be more expensive by $13500-13382.255 \\approx \\boxed{118 \\text{ dollars}}$.",
