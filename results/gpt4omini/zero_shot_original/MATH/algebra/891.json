        "To find out how much Dr. Zaius has after rolling over the CD, we will break the problem down into two parts\u2014calculating the amount after the first CD and then figuring the total after the second CD.\n**Step 1: Calculate the amount after the first CD.**\nDr. Zaius invests \\$10,000 in a CD with an annual interest rate of 4% that compounds semi-annually. \nThe formula to calculate the future value for compound interest is given by:\n\\[\nA = P \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt}\n\\]\nwhere:\n- \\(A\\) = the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n- \\(P\\) = the principal amount (the initial amount of money).\n- \\(r\\) = the annual interest rate (decimal).\n- \\(n\\) = the number of times that interest is compounded per year.\n- \\(t\\) = the time the money is invested for in years.\nFor the first CD:\n- \\(P = 10000\\)\n- \\(r = 0.04\\) (4% as a decimal)\n- \\(n = 2\\) (because it compounds semi-annually)\n- \\(t = 0.5\\) (as he holds it for 6 months)\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\n\\[\nA = 10000 \\left(1 + \\frac{0.04}{2}\\right)^{2 \\times 0.5}\n\\]\nCalculating further:\n\\[\nA = 10000 \\left(1 + 0.02\\right)^{1} = 10000 \\times 1.02 = 10200\n\\]\nSo, after the first six months, Dr. Zaius has \\$10,200.\n**Step 2: Calculate the amount after rolling into the second CD.**\nNow, he rolls over \\$10,200 into a second CD with an annual interest rate of 5%, compounding semi-annually. \nFor the second CD:\n- \\(P = 10200\\)\n- \\(r = 0.05\\) (5% as a decimal)\n- \\(n = 2\\) (compounding semi-annually)\n- \\(t = 0.5\\) (for the next 6 months)\nUsing the same formula:\n\\[\nA = 10200 \\left(1 + \\frac{0.05}{2}\\right)^{2 \\times 0.5}\n\\]\nCalculating further:\n\\[\nA = 10200 \\left(1 + 0.025\\right)^{1} = 10200 \\times 1.025\n\\]\nNow compute \\(10200 \\times 1.025\\):\n\\[\nA = 10200 \\times 1.025 = 10425\n\\]\nThus, after six months in the second CD, Dr. Zaius has **$10,425**. \nTherefore, the final amount Dr. Zaius has after the two CDs is \\(\\boxed{10425}\\) dollars.",
