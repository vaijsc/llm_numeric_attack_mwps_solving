    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The radius of the circular path of the horse closer to the center is $\\frac{1}{4}$ of the radius of the path of the horse farther from the center.  Since circumference is directly proportional to radius, the length of shorter path is $\\frac{1}{4}$ of the length of the longer path.  Therefore, 4 times as many revolutions must be made to go the same distance, which is $27\\times4=\\boxed{108}$ revolutions.",

        "To determine how many revolutions the horse 16 feet from the center of the merry-go-round would have to make to travel the same distance as a horse 64 feet from the center making 27 revolutions, we will follow these steps:\n1. **Calculate the circumference of the circle for the horse 64 feet from the center:**\n   The formula for the circumference \\(C\\) of a circle is:\n   \\[\n   C = 2 \\pi r\n   \\]\n   where \\(r\\) is the radius.\n   For the horse at 64 feet:\n   \\[\n   C_{64} = 2 \\pi \\times 64 = 128 \\pi \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n2. **Calculate the total distance traveled by the horse at 64 feet after 27 revolutions:**\n   The total distance \\(D\\) traveled is:\n   \\[\n   D = \\text{Number of revolutions} \\times \\text{Circumference}\n   \\]\n   So for 27 revolutions:\n   \\[\n   D = 27 \\times C_{64} = 27 \\times 128 \\pi = 3456 \\pi \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n3. **Calculate the circumference of the circle for the horse 16 feet from the center:**\n   Using the circumference formula again:\n   \\[\n   C_{16} = 2 \\pi \\times 16 = 32 \\pi \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n4. **Set up the equation to find how many revolutions \\(n\\) the horse at 16 feet needs to make to travel the same distance \\(D\\):**\n   We need to find \\(n\\) such that:\n   \\[\n   n \\times C_{16} = D\n   \\]\n   Substituting our earlier results:\n   \\[\n   n \\times 32 \\pi = 3456 \\pi\n   \\]\n5. **Solve for \\(n\\):**\n   Divide both sides by \\(32 \\pi\\):\n   \\[\n   n = \\frac{3456 \\pi}{32 \\pi} = \\frac{3456}{32} = 108\n   \\]\nTherefore, the horse 16 feet from the center would have to make **108 revolutions** to travel the same distance as the horse 64 feet from the center making 27 revolutions.",
        "To determine how many revolutions a horse 16 feet from the center of a merry-go-round would have to make to travel the same distance as a horse 64 feet from the center making 27 revolutions, we can follow these steps:\n1. **Calculate the distance traveled by the horse 64 feet from the center:**\n   The distance a horse travels in one revolution is equal to the circumference of the circle it makes.
