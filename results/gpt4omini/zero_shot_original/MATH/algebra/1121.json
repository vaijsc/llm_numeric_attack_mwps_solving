        "To factor the expression \\(32x^3 - 4x^2 + 20x\\), we will follow these steps:\n1. **Identify the greatest common factor (GCF)**: \n   We look for the GCF of the coefficients \\(32\\), \\(-4\\), and \\(20\\). The GCF is \\(4\\). \n   We also note that all terms have at least one factor of \\(x\\). So the overall GCF is \\(4x\\).\n2. **Factor out the GCF**:\n   We factor \\(4x\\) out of each term in the expression:\n   \\[\n   32x^3 - 4x^2 + 20x = 4x(8x^2 - x + 5)\n   \\]\n3. **Check the factored expression**:\n   Now we confirm that factoring was done correctly by distributing \\(4x\\) back across \\(8x^2 - x + 5\\):\n   \\[\n   4x(8x^2) + 4x(-x) + 4x(5) = 32x^3 - 4x^2 + 20x\n   \\]\n   This matches our original expression, so the factorization is verified.\n4. **Examine the quadratic \\(8x^2 - x + 5\\)**:\n   It is a quadratic expression. To factor \\(8x^2 - x + 5\\), we can check the discriminant to see if it can be factored further:\n   The discriminant \\(D\\) is given by \\(b^2 - 4ac\\), where \\(a = 8\\), \\(b = -1\\), and \\(c = 5\\):\n   \\[\n   D = (-1)^2 - 4 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 5 = 1 - 160 = -159\n   \\]\n   Since the discriminant is negative, \\(8x^2 - x + 5\\) cannot be factored further over the real numbers.\nThus, the fully factored form of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{4x(8x^2 - x + 5)}\n\\]",
        "To factor the expression \\(32x^3 - 4x^2 + 20x\\), we can follow these steps:\n1. **Identify the Greatest Common Factor (GCF)**: \n   First, we will look for the GCF of the coefficients and the variables in the expression. \n   The coefficients are 32, -4, and 20.
