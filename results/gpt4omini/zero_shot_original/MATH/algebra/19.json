    "problem": "In a 8 fluid ounce bottle of Vitamin Water, there are 125 calories. How many calories would be contained in a 12 fluid ounce bottle? Express your answer in decimal form.",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We know that there are 125 calories in 8 fluid ounces of Vitamin Water, so we can set up the proportion $\\frac{125}{8}=\\frac{x}{12}$, where $x$ is the number of calories contained in a 12 fluid ounce bottle. Solving for $x$, we find that $x=\\left(\\frac{125}{8}\\right)(12)=\\boxed{187.5}$ calories.",

        "To find the number of calories in a 12 fluid ounce bottle of Vitamin Water, we can first determine the number of calories per fluid ounce in the 8 fluid ounce bottle. \n1. **Calculate calories per fluid ounce in the 8 oz bottle**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Calories per fluid ounce} = \\frac{\\text{Total calories}}{\\text{Total fluid ounces}} = \\frac{125 \\text{ calories}}{8 \\text{ oz}} = 15.625 \\text{ calories/oz}\n   \\]\n2. **Now, find the total calories in a 12 fluid ounce bottle**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total calories in 12 oz} = \\text{Calories per fluid ounce} \\times \\text{Number of fluid ounces} = 15.625 \\text{ calories/oz} \\times 12 \\text{ oz}\n   \\]\n3. **Calculate that product**:\n   \\[\n   15.625 \\times 12 = 187.5 \\text{ calories}\n   \\]\nSo, a 12 fluid ounce bottle of Vitamin Water would contain **187.5 calories**.",
        "To find out how many calories are in a 12 fluid ounce bottle of Vitamin Water, we first need to determine the calorie content per ounce. \n1. **Determine the calories per ounce:**\n   - We know that an 8 fluid ounce bottle contains 125 calories.\n   - To find calories per ounce, we divide the total calories by the number of ounces:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Calories per ounce} = \\frac{125 \\text{ calories}}{8 \\text{ ounces}} = 15.625 \\text{ calories per ounce}\n     \\]\n2. **Calculate the calories in a 12 fluid ounce bottle:**\n   - Now we multiply the calories per ounce by the number of ounces in the larger bottle:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Calories in 12 ounces} = 15.625 \\text{ calories per ounce} \\times 12 \\text{ ounces}\n     \\]\n3. **Perform the multiplication:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Calories in 12 ounces} = 15.625 \\times 12 = 187.5 \\text{ calories}\n   \\]\nThus, a 12 fluid ounce bottle of Vitamin Water contains **187.5 calories**.",
