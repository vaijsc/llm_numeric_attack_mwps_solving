        "To determine how much Mike will be offered for the stamp in 12 more years, we can follow these steps:\n1. **Identify the current situation:**\n   - Mike paid $1.25 for the stamp three years ago.\n2. **Understand the doubling pattern:**\n   - The price of the stamp doubles every three years.\n3. **Calculate the future time frame:**\n   - Mike has already passed 3 years, and we want to determine the price in 12 more years. Hence, the total time since he originally bought the stamp will be:\n     \\[\n     3 \\text{ years} + 12 \\text{ years} = 15 \\text{ years}\n     \\]\n4. **Determine how many doubling periods are in 15 years:**\n   - Since the price doubles every 3 years, we can find the number of 3-year periods in 15 years:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{15 \\text{ years}}{3 \\text{ years/doubling}} = 5 \\text{ doublings}\n     \\]\n5. **Calculate the value of the stamp after those doublings:**\n   - The initial price of the stamp is $1.25. After each doubling, the price can be calculated using the formula:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Final Price} = \\text{Initial Price} \\times 2^{\\text{number of doublings}}\n     \\]\n   - Plugging in the values:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Final Price} = 1.25 \\times 2^5\n     \\]\n6. **Calculating \\(2^5\\):**\n   - \\(2^5 = 32\\)\n7. **Calculate the final price by multiplying:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Final Price} = 1.25 \\times 32 = 40\n   \\]\nThus, in 12 more years, Mike will be offered **$40** for the stamp.",
        "To determine how much Mike will be offered for the stamp in 12 more years, we can break down the process into manageable steps based on the information given:\n1. **Initial Stamp Price**: Mike paid $1.25 for the stamp three years ago.\n2. **Doubling Frequency**: It is stated that the price of the stamp doubles every three years.\n3. **Time Calculation**: Since Mike is looking for the offer price in 12 more years, we start from the present time (3 years after the initial purchase). Therefore, we need to consider the total time elapsed concerning the doubling intervals:\n   - Total time = 3 years (already passed) + 12 years = 15 years from the original purchase.\n4. **Number of Doubling Intervals**: Since the stamp price doubles every 3 years, we calculate how many full intervals of 3 years fit into 15 years:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{15 \\text{ years}}{3 \\text{ years/interval}} = 5 \\text{ intervals}\n   \\]\n5. **Doubling Calculation**: The price of the stamp after 5 doubling intervals can be calculated by taking the initial price and doubling it 5 times:\n   - Initial price = $1.25\n   - After 1st interval (3 years): \n     \\[\n     1.25 \\times 2 = 2.50\n     \\]\n   - After 2nd interval (6 years):\n     \\[\n     2.50 \\times 2 = 5.00\n     \\]\n   - After 3rd interval (9 years):\n     \\[\n     5.00 \\times 2 = 10.00\n     \\]\n   - After 4th interval (12 years):\n     \\[\n     10.00 \\times 2 = 20.00\n     \\]\n   - After 5th interval (15 years):\n     \\[\n     20.00 \\times 2 = 40.00\n     \\]\n   \n6. **Final Offer Price**: Thus, after 15 years, Mike will be offered:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Offer Price} = 40.00 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\nTherefore, the amount Mike will be offered for the stamp in 12 more years is \\(\\boxed{40.00}\\).",
        "To solve the problem, we start with the initial price Mike paid for the stamp and how the price changes over time.\n1. **Initial Price**: Mike paid $1.25 for the stamp three years ago.\n2. **Price Offer After Three Years**: He was offered double that amount recently. So, we calculate this:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Current Offer Price} = 2 \\times 1.25 = 2.50\n   \\]\n3. **Doubling Period**: The stamp's price doubles every three years. We need to find out how much the stamp will be worth in 12 more years.\n4. **Total Time from the Initial Purchase**: Since Mike bought the stamp three years ago, and we are looking at an additional 12 years, the total time from the purchase will be:\n   \\[\n   3 \\text{ years (already passed)} + 12 \\text{ years (in the future)} = 15 \\text{ years}\n   \\]\n5. **Calculating Doubling Intervals**: The number of three-year intervals within 15 years can be calculated as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of intervals} = \\frac{15 \\text{ years}}{3 \\text{ years/interval}} = 5\n   \\]\n6. **Final Price Calculation**: The price of the stamp doubles with every interval. Since the current offer is $2.50, the price after 5 intervals of doubling will be:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Final Price} = 2.50 \\times 2^5\n   \\]\n   Now we calculate \\(2^5\\):\n   \\[\n   2^5 = 32\n   \\]\n   So,\n   \\[\n   \\text{Final Price} = 2.50 \\times 32 = 80.00\n   \\]\nTherefore, in 12 more years, Mike will be offered \\(\\boxed{80.00}\\) dollars for the stamp.",
        "To determine how much Mike will be offered for the stamp in 12 more years, we first note that Mike's stamp price doubles every 3 years.\n1. **Current Offer Price**: Mike is currently offered \\( 2 \\times 1.25 = 2.50 \\) dollars for the stamp since he paid $1.25 three years ago and that amount has doubled.\n2. **Envisioning the Future**: We need to find out how many 3-year periods are in the next 12 years:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{12 \\text{ years}}{3 \\text{ years/period}} = 4 \\text{ periods}\n   \\]\n   This means the price will double 4 times in the next 12 years.\n3. **Calculating the Future Offer Price**:\n   Starting from the current offer of $2.50, we can find the value after each period:\n   - After 1 period (3 years): \n     \\[\n     2.50 \\times 2 = 5.00 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n   - After 2 periods (6 years):\n     \\[\n     5.00 \\times 2 = 10.00 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n   - After 3 periods (9 years):\n     \\[\n     10.00 \\times 2 = 20.00 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n   - After 4 periods (12 years):\n     \\[\n     20.00 \\times 2 = 40.00 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n4. **Final Result**: Therefore, after 12 more years, Mike will be offered **$40.00** for the stamp.\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{40.00}\n\\]",
        "To find out how much Mike will be offered for the stamp in 12 years, we start with the understanding that the offered price doubles every 3 years. \n1. **Initial Amount**: Mike paid $1.25 for the stamp three years ago.\n2. **Current Offer**: He has been offered double that amount now:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Current offer} = 2 \\times 1.25 = 2.50\n   \\]\n3. **Time Period Calculation**: We need to determine the offer in 12 more years. Since the current offer is after 3 years, we consider the next 12 years as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total time until the next offer} = 3 \\text{ years (already elapsed)} + 12 \\text{ years} = 15 \\text{ years}\n   \\]\n4. **Finding the number of times the price doubles**: The price doubles every 3 years. To find out how many times the price will double in 15 years, we divide 15 by 3:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of doublings} = \\frac{15}{3} = 5\n   \\]\n5. **Calculating the final offer**: Since the current offer is $2.50, we will double this amount 5 times:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Final offer} = 2.50 \\times 2^5\n   \\]\n   First, calculate \\(2^5\\):\n   \\[\n   2^5 = 32\n   \\]\n   Now we can calculate the final offer:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Final offer} = 2.50 \\times 32 = 80\n   \\]\nTherefore, the amount Mike will be offered for the stamp in 12 more years is \\(\\boxed{80}\\) dollars."
