        "To determine the least number of widgets the company must sell to make a profit, we need to analyze the costs and revenues associated with selling these widgets.\n1. **Fixed Costs**: The company has a one-time equipment fee of \\$1000. This cost does not change regardless of how many widgets are produced.\n2. **Variable Costs**: It costs \\$0.50 to produce each widget. If the company produces \\( x \\) widgets, the total variable cost would be:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Variable Cost} = 0.50x\n   \\]\n3. **Total Costs**: The total cost incurred by the company, which includes both fixed and variable costs, can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Cost} = \\text{Fixed Cost} + \\text{Variable Cost} = 1000 + 0.50x\n   \\]\n4. **Revenue**: The company sells each widget for \\$2.75. Therefore, if \\( x \\) widgets are sold, the total revenue would be:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Revenue} = 2.75x\n   \\]\n5. **Profit Condition**: To find the break-even point where the company begins to make a profit, we need to set the total revenue equal to the total costs and solve for \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Revenue} = \\text{Total Cost}\n   \\]\n   This gives us the equation:\n   \\[\n   2.75x = 1000 + 0.50x\n   \\]\n6. **Solve for \\( x \\)**:\n   - First, isolate \\( x \\) by moving all terms involving \\( x \\) to one side of the equation:\n   \\[\n   2.75x - 0.50x = 1000\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   2.25x = 1000\n   \\]\n   - Next, divide both sides by 2.25 to solve for \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{1000}{2.25}\n   \\]\n7. **Calculate \\( x \\)**:\n   - Perform the division:\n   \\[\n   x \\approx 444.44\n   \\]\nSince the company cannot sell a fraction of a widget, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the least number of widgets the company needs to sell to start making a profit is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{445}\n\\]",
        "To find the least number of widgets the company has to sell in order to make a profit, we can breakdown the costs and revenues involved in selling widgets.\n1. **Identify Fixed Costs**: The company has a one-time equipment fee of $1000. This is a fixed cost that does not change with the number of widgets sold.\n2. **Identify Variable Costs**: The production cost for each widget is $0.50. If \\( x \\) is the number of widgets produced, then the total variable cost is \\( 0.50x \\).\n3. **Total Cost Calculation**: The total cost \\( C \\) of producing \\( x \\) widgets is the sum of fixed and variable costs:\n   \\[\n   C = 1000 + 0.50x\n   \\]\n4. **Define Revenue**: The company sells each widget for $2.75. Therefore, the total revenue \\( R \\) from selling \\( x \\) widgets is:\n   \\[\n   R = 2.75x\n   \\]\n5. **Profit Condition**: The company makes a profit when total revenue \\( R \\) exceeds total cost \\( C \\):\n   \\[\n   R > C\n   \\]\n   Substituting the expressions for revenue and cost, we have:\n   \\[\n   2.75x > 1000 + 0.50x\n   \\]\n6. **Solve the Inequality**: To solve for \\( x \\), we first rearrange the inequality:\n   \\[\n   2.75x - 0.50x > 1000\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   2.25x > 1000\n   \\]\n   Now, divide both sides by 2.25:\n   \\[\n   x > \\frac{1000}{2.25}\n   \\]\n7. **Calculate**: Performing the division gives:\n   \\[\n   x > 444.44\n   \\]\n8. **Determine the Least Whole Number**: Since \\( x \\) must be a whole number (as you can't sell a fraction of a widget), we round up to the nearest whole number:\n   \\[\n   x \\geq 445\n   \\]\nThus, the least number of widgets the company has to sell in order to make a profit is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{445}\n\\]",
        "To determine the least number of widgets the company must sell to make a profit, we start by calculating the total cost of producing \\( n \\) widgets and the total revenue from selling \\( n \\) widgets.\n1. **Calculate Total Costs:**\n   - The total cost consists of the one-time equipment fee and the variable cost for producing the widgets. The one-time fee is \\$1000, and the cost to produce each widget is \\$0.50.\n   - Therefore, the total cost, \\( C(n) \\), for producing \\( n \\) widgets can be expressed as:\n     \\[\n     C(n) = 1000 + 0.50n\n     \\]\n2. **Calculate Total Revenue:**\n   - The revenue earned from selling \\( n \\) widgets is given by the selling price per widget multiplied by the number of widgets sold.
