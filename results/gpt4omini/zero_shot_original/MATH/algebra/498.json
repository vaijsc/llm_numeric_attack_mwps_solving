        "To determine how many minutes it will take Jeremiah to travel 20 miles at a speed of 60 miles per hour, we can follow these steps:\n1. **Understand the speed**: The car is traveling at a speed of 60 miles per hour. This means that in 1 hour, the car will cover 60 miles.\n2. **Calculate the time to travel 20 miles**: We need to find out how much time it takes to cover 20 miles. Since we know the speed, we can use the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}}\n   \\]\n   Here, the distance is 20 miles, and the speed is 60 miles per hour.\n3. **Plug in the values**: \n   \\[\n   \\text{Time} = \\frac{20 \\text{ miles}}{60 \\text{ miles per hour}} = \\frac{20}{60} \\text{ hours} = \\frac{1}{3} \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n4. **Convert hours to minutes**: There are 60 minutes in an hour, so to convert \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) hours to minutes, we multiply by 60:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time in minutes} = \\frac{1}{3} \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes per hour} = 20 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\nTherefore, it will take Jeremiah **20 minutes** to travel 20 miles at a speed of 60 miles per hour.",
        "To determine how long it will take Jeremiah to travel 20 miles at a speed of 60 miles per hour, we can follow these steps:\n1. **Understand the relationship between distance, speed, and time**: The formula to calculate time is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}}\n   \\]\n2. **Substitute the known values**: In this case, the distance is 20 miles and the speed is 60 miles per hour. Plugging these values into the formula gives:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time} = \\frac{20 \\text{ miles}}{60 \\text{ miles per hour}}\n   \\]\n3. **Perform the division**: \n   \\[\n   \\text{Time} = \\frac{20}{60} = \\frac{1}{3} \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n4. **Convert hours to minutes**: Since we want the time in minutes, we can convert hours to minutes by multiplying by 60 (because there are 60 minutes in an hour):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{3} \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 20 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\nThus, it will take Jeremiah **20 minutes** to travel 20 miles at a speed of 60 miles per hour.",
        "To determine how long it will take Jeremiah to travel 20 miles at a speed of 60 miles per hour, we can follow these steps:\n1. **Understand the units**: Since the speed is given in miles per hour (mph), we need to convert the time to minutes since the question asks how many minutes it will take.\n2. **Calculate the time in hours**: We can use the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time} = \\frac{20 \\text{ miles}}{60 \\text{ mph}} = \\frac{20}{60} \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n3. **Simplify the fraction**:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{60} = \\frac{1}{3} \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n4. **Convert hours to minutes**: Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{3} \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 20 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\nThus, it will take Jeremiah **20 minutes** to travel 20 miles at a speed of 60 miles per hour.",
        "To determine how many minutes it will take Jeremiah to travel 20 miles at a speed of 60 miles per hour, we can follow these steps:\n1. **Find the time in hours**: \n   We use the formula for time, which is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}}\n   \\]\n   Here the distance is 20 miles and the speed is 60 miles per hour.\n   Plugging the values into the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time} = \\frac{20 \\text{ miles}}{60 \\text{ miles per hour}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n2. **Convert hours to minutes**: \n   There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we multiply the time in hours by 60 to convert it to minutes:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time in minutes} = \\frac{1}{3} \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 20 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\nThus, it will take Jeremiah 20 minutes to travel 20 miles at a speed of 60 miles per hour.",
        "To find out how many minutes it will take Jeremiah to travel 20 miles at a speed of 60 miles per hour, we can follow these steps:\n1. **Determine the time in hours:** \n   - We know that speed is equal to distance divided by time. We can rearrange the formula to solve for time:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}}\n     \\]\n   - In this case, the distance is 20 miles and the speed is 60 miles per hour:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Time} = \\frac{20 \\text{ miles}}{60 \\text{ miles per hour}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n2. **Convert hours to minutes:**\n   - Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, we convert \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) hours into minutes:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{3} \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 20 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\nTherefore, it will take Jeremiah **20 minutes** to travel 20 miles at a speed of 60 miles per hour."
