    "problem": "Twelve people purchased supplies for a ten-day camping trip with the understanding that each of the twelve will get equal daily shares. They are then joined by three more people, but make no further purchases. How many days will the supplies last if the original daily share for each person is not changed?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since each person of the original group had 10 daily shares, the total supplies are equivalent to 120 daily shares. When 3 people join the group, the total number of people becomes 15. Then each person in the new group will have $\\frac{120}{15}$ or 8 daily shares. The supplies will last $\\boxed{8}$ days.",

        "To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:\n1. **Initial Number of People**: We start with 12 people.\n  \n2. **Total Supplies and Days**: The supplies are purchased for a 10-day camping trip, which means that the total amount of supplies is based on 12 people each getting a share for 10 days.\n   - The total amount of supplies can be calculated in terms of \"person-days\":\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total person-days} = \\text{Number of people} \\times \\text{Number of days} = 12 \\text{ people} \\times 10 \\text{ days} = 120 \\text{ person-days}.\n     \\]\n3. **Joining of More People**: Now, 3 more people join, making the total number of people:\n   \\[\n   12 + 3 = 15 \\text{ people}.\n   \\]\n4. **Using the Same Daily Share**: The problem states that the original daily share for each person is not changed. This means each person still consumes the same amount per day as planned.\n5. **Calculating the New Duration**: The total supplies (120 person-days) must now be divided among the new total of 15 people. To find out how many days the supplies will last, we can set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Days supplies will last} = \\frac{\\text{Total person-days}}{\\text{Number of people}} = \\frac{120 \\text{ person-days}}{15 \\text{ people}}.\n   \\]\n6. **Performing the Calculation**:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{120}{15} = 8 \\text{ days}.\n   \\]\n7. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the supplies will last for ***8 days*** when 3 extra people join the group and no additional purchases are made. \nThe final answer is that the supplies will last **8 days**.",
        "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n1. **Original Supplies Calculation**:\n   There are **12 people** who originally purchased supplies for a **10-day camping trip**. This means that the total amount of supplies is sufficient for:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total supplies} = 12 \\text{ people} \\times 10 \\text{ days} = 120 \\text{ person-days}\n   \\]\n   This means that the supplies are enough for 120 person-days.\n2. **Joining of Additional People**:\n   After the initial purchases, **3 more people** join the group. This brings the total number of people to:\n   \\[\n   12 + 3 = 15 \\text{ people}\n   \\]\n3. **Daily Share Calculation**:\n   Despite the increase in the number of people, the daily share of supplies per person remains unchanged. Each person still gets their original share, which was designed for 12 people. So, daily, the group needs:\n   \\[\n   15 \\text{ people} \\times 1 \\text{ share} = 15 \\text{ shares per day}\n   \\]\n4. **Determining How Many Days Supplies Last**:\n   The total supplies (in terms of person-days) is 120, and now we need to find out how many days these supplies will last when being shared by 15 people. To find the number of days that will be supported by the supplies, we divide the total supplies by the new daily requirement:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of days supplies will last} = \\frac{120 \\text{ person-days}}{15 \\text{ shares per day}} = 8 \\text{ days}\n   \\]\nThe supplies will last for **8 days** under the new arrangement with 15 people.",
        "To determine how many days the supplies will last after three more people join the original twelve, we can follow these steps:\n1. **Determine Total Daily Shares Initially**: \n   The original twelve people planned supplies for ten days. Therefore, the total number of daily shares needed is:\n   \\[\n   12 \\text{ people} \\times 10 \\text{ days} = 120 \\text{ daily shares}\n   \\]\n2. **Calculate Daily Share for Each Person**: \n   Each person\u2019s daily share is 1 share per person. Thus, the supplies were intended to provide:\n   \\[\n   12 \\text{ shares per day}\n   \\]\n   for the twelve people.\n3. **Calculate Total Supply**: \n   The supplies can be thought of as providing a total of 120 shares, which corresponds to 10 days for 12 people.\n4. **Total Number of People After Joining**: \n   When three more people join, the total number of people becomes:\n   \\[\n   12 \\text{ original people} + 3 \\text{ additional people} = 15 \\text{ people}\n   \\]\n5. **Determine New Daily Requirement**: \n   With 15 people sharing the same daily allocation of supplies, the new daily shares required are:\n   \\[\n   15 \\text{ shares per day}\n   \\]\n6. **Calculate How Many Days Supplies Will Last**: \n   To find out how many days the original total of 120 daily shares will last under the new requirement:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of days the supplies will last} = \\frac{\\text{Total shares}}{\\text{Daily shares used}}\n   \\]\n   Plugging in the numbers:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of days} = \\frac{120 \\text{ total shares}}{15 \\text{ shares per day}} = 8 \\text{ days}\n   \\]\nThus, the supplies will last for **8 days** with 15 people using them.",
        "To determine how many days the supplies will last after three additional people join the group, we can follow these steps:\n1. **Calculate the total number of supplies**: \n   The supplies purchased were meant for 12 people over 10 days. Therefore, the total number of daily shares can be calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total daily shares} = \\text{number of people} \\times \\text{number of days} = 12 \\times 10 = 120 \\text{ daily shares}\n   \\]\n2. **Determine the new group size**: \n   When three more people join the group, the total number of people becomes:\n   \\[\n   \\text{New group size} = 12 + 3 = 15 \\text{ people}\n   \\]\n3. **Calculate how long the supplies will last**:\n   Since the initial number of daily shares is 120, and now there are 15 people consuming the supplies, we need to find out how many days these supplies will last at the rate of 15 people.\n   \n   We can set up the equation based on the total number of daily shares:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of days supplies will last} = \\frac{\\text{Total daily shares}}{\\text{Number of people}} = \\frac{120}{15}\n   \\]\n4. **Perform the division**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of days supplies will last} = 8\n   \\]\nThus, the supplies will last for **8 days** after the three additional people join the camping trip.",
        "To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many total \"daily shares\" of supplies the group has after the original 12 people purchase supplies for a ten-day camping trip.\n1. **Calculate Total Daily Shares**:\n   Since the original 12 people planned for 10 days, the total number of daily shares they purchased is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Daily Shares} = 12 \\, (\\text{people}) \\times 10 \\, (\\text{days}) = 120 \\, \\text{daily shares}\n   \\]\n2. **Introducing Additional People**:\n   When the group of 12 is joined by 3 more people, the total number of people becomes:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total People} = 12 + 3 = 15\n   \\]\n3. **Determine the Number of Days Supplies Will Last**:\n   Now, we need to calculate how many days the original supplies will last for 15 people, while keeping the original daily share unchanged. We know we have 120 total daily shares available, and we will divide this by the number of people:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Days Supplies Will Last} = \\frac{\\text{Total Daily Shares}}{\\text{Total People}} = \\frac{120}{15} = 8 \\, \\text{days}\n   \\]\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   Therefore, the supplies will last for **8 days** once the additional 3 people join, assuming the original daily share for each person ($\\frac{120 \\text{ daily shares}}{12 \\text{ people}} = 10 \\text{ daily shares per person for 10 days}$) is kept unchanged.\nThus, after analyzing the problem step-by-step, we conclude that the supplies will last for **8 days**."
