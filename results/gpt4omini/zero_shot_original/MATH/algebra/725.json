    "solution": "Let $n$ be the number of matches she won before the weekend began. Since her win ratio started at exactly .$500 = \\tfrac{1}{2},$ she must have played exactly $2n$ games total before the weekend began. After the weekend, she would have won $n+3$ games out of $2n+4$ total. Therefore, her win ratio would be $(n+3)/(2n+4).$ This means that \\[\\frac{n+3}{2n+4} > .503 = \\frac{503}{1000}.\\]Cross-multiplying, we get $1000(n+3) > 503(2n+4),$ which is equivalent to $n < \\frac{988}{6} = 164.\\overline{6}.$ Since $n$ must be an integer, the largest possible value for $n$ is $\\boxed{164}.$",

        "Let \\( W \\) be the number of matches won before the weekend and \\( L \\) be the number of matches lost before the weekend. The total number of matches played before the weekend is \\( T = W + L \\). \nGiven that her win ratio is exactly \\( 0.500 \\) at the beginning of the weekend, this tells us:\n\\[\n\\frac{W}{T} = 0.500 \\implies W = 0.500 T \\implies W = \\frac{T}{2}.\n\\]\nSince \\( W \\) must be an integer, \\( T \\) must be even. Let's denote \\( T = 2n \\) for some integer \\( n \\), which leads to \\( W = n \\) and \\( L = n \\) (from \\( T = W + L \\)).\nThe player plays four matches over the weekend, winning three and losing one. Therefore, after the weekend:\n- New total wins \\( = W + 3 \\),\n- New total losses \\( = L + 1 \\),\n- New total matches \\( = T + 4 = 2n + 4 \\).\nNow, the new win ratio is given by:\n\\[\n\\text{New Win Ratio} = \\frac{W + 3}{T + 4} = \\frac{n + 3}{2n + 4}.\n\\]\nIt is stated that this new win ratio is greater than \\( 0.503 \\):\n\\[\n\\frac{n + 3}{2n + 4} > 0.503.\n\\]\nTo eliminate the fraction, we cross-multiply:\n\\[\n(n + 3) > 0.503(2n + 4).\n\\]\nExpanding the right-hand side:\n\\[\nn + 3 > 1.006n + 2.012.\n\\]\nRearranging gives:\n\\[\nn + 3 - 2.012 > 1.006n \\implies n + 0.988 > 1.006n.\n\\]\nFurther simplifying yields:\n\\[\n0.988 > 1.006n - n \\implies 0.988 > 0.006n.\n\\]\nDividing both sides by \\( 0.006 \\):\n\\[\n\\frac{0.988}{0.006} > n \\implies 164.6667 > n.\n\\]\nSince \\( n \\) is an integer, the maximum value for \\( n \\) is 164. Consequently, we compute \\( W \\):\n\\[\nW = n = 164.\n\\]\nTo check if this value of \\( W \\) satisfies the conditions:\n1. Calculate \\( L \\):\n\\[\nL = n = 164.\n\\]\nThus, the total matches before the weekend:\n\\[\nT = W + L = 164 + 164 = 328.\n\\]\n2. Calculate the new win ratio after the weekend:\nAfter winning three matches and losing one, the new totals become:\n- Wins: \\( 164 + 3 = 167 \\),\n- Losses: \\( 164 + 1 = 165 \\),\n- Total matches played: \\( 328 + 4 = 332 \\).\nThe new win ratio is:\n\\[\n\\frac{167}{332}.\n\\]\nCalculating to check if this is greater than \\( 0.503 \\):\n\\[\n0.503 \\times 332 = 166.996.\n\\]\nSince \\( 167 > 166.996 \\), we confirm that:\n\\[\n\\frac{167}{332} > 0.503.\n\\]\nConclusively, the largest number of matches she could have won before the weekend began is \n\\[\n\\boxed{164}.\n\\]",

Now, substituting \\( T = 329 \\) back to find \\( W \\):\n\\[\nW = 0.500 \\times 329 = 164.5\n\\]\nSince \\( W \\) must also be an integer, the greatest integer less than \\( 164.5 \\) is \\( 164 \\). Thus, we can have \\( T = 328 \\) or \\( T = 330 \\). \nTesting \\( T = 328 \\):\n\\[\nW = \\frac{328}{2} = 164 \n\\]\nVerifying the win ratio after the weekend:\n\\[\nW' = 164 + 3 = 167, \\quad T' = 328 + 4 = 332\n\\]\nWe calculate:\n\\[\n\\text{Win ratio} = \\frac{167}{332} \\approx 0.50299\n\\]\nThis does not satisfy the win ratio being greater than \\( 0.503 \\).\nNow testing \\( W = 165 \\) where \\( T = 330\\):\n\\[\nW' = 165 + 3 = 168, \\quad T' = 330 + 4 = 334\n\\]\nCalculating the win ratio:\n\\[\n\\text{Win ratio} = \\frac{168}{334} \\approx 0.50299\n\\]\nThis also does not satisfy \\( > 0.503 \\).\nContinuing down, testing \\( W = 164 \\) and \\( T = 328 \\) gives:\n\\[\nW = 164 + 3 = 167, \\quad T = 328 + 4 = 332, \n\\]\nChecking all cases thoroughly establishes limits. \nFinally, after recalculating distinct factors leading to win ratios for maximum integer \\( T = 324 \\) corresponds:\n\\[\nT = 326,  W = 163\n\\]\nSo the largest wins align at testable margins exceeding \\( T \\).
