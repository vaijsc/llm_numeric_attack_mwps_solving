        "To calculate Louis's total earnings for the month, we need to consider both his base salary and the commission he earns from sales.\n1. **Base Salary**: Louis earns a fixed base salary of $1,200 per month.\n2. **Sales Commission**: Louis earns a commission of 5% on his sales. For the month, his sales total $25,000.\n   We can calculate the commission by using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Commission} = \\text{Sales} \\times \\text{Commission Rate}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Commission} = 25,000 \\times 0.05\n   \\]\n   Now, performing the multiplication:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Commission} = 25,000 \\times 0.05 = 1,250\n   \\]\n3. **Total Earnings Calculation**: To find the total earnings, we add the base salary to the commission:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Earnings} = \\text{Base Salary} + \\text{Commission}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Earnings} = 1,200 + 1,250\n   \\]\n   Performing the addition gives:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Earnings} = 2,450\n   \\]\nSo, Louis's total earnings for the month with $25,000 in sales is \\(\\$2,450\\). \nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2450}\n\\]",
