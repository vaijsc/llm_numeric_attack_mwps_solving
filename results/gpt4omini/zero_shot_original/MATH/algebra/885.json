Setting the right-hand sides equal to each other, we find \\begin{align*}\n-5x+44&=x^4-16x^2+64\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n0&=x^4-16x^2+5x+20\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n&=x^2(x^2-16)+5(x+4)\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n&=x^2(x-4)(x+4)+5(x+4)\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n&=(x+4)(x^3-4x^2+5).\n\\end{align*} Therefore, one of the solutions has an $x$-value of $-4$. Then there is the polynomial $x^3-4x^2+5$. The only possible rational roots are now $\\pm1$ and $\\pm5$. Using synthetic or long division, it can be determined that $(x+1)$ is a factor: \\[(x+1)(x^2-5x+5)=x^3-4x^2+5\\] Therefore, one of the solutions has an $x$-value of $-1$. Because $x^2-5x+5$ does not factor easily, we use the quadratic formula to get \\begin{align*}\nx&=\\frac{5\\pm\\sqrt{25-4\\cdot1\\cdot5}}{2}\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n&=\\frac{5\\pm\\sqrt{5}}{2}.\n\\end{align*} The four values for $x$ are then $-4, -1, \\frac{5\\pm\\sqrt{5}}{2}$. Squaring each: \\[(-4)^2=16\\] \\[(-1)^2=1\\] \\[\\left(\\frac{5+\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right)^2=\\frac{25+10\\sqrt{5}+5}{4}=\\frac{15+5\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\] \\[\\left(\\frac{5-\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right)^2=\\frac{25-10\\sqrt{5}+5}{4}=\\frac{15-5\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\] And subtracting $8$: \\[16-8=8\\] \\[1-8=-7\\] \\[\\frac{15+5\\sqrt{5}}{2}-\\frac{16}{2}=\\frac{-1+5\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\] \\[\\frac{15-5\\sqrt{5}}{2}-\\frac{16}{2}=\\frac{-1-5\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\] Therefore, the four solutions are $$(-4,8),(-1,-7),$$ $$\\left(\\frac{5+\\sqrt{5}}{2},\\frac{-1+5\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right),\\left(\\frac{5-\\sqrt{5}}{2},\\frac{-1-5\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right).$$\n\nMultiplying the $y$-coordinates: \\[8\\cdot-7\\cdot\\frac{-1+5\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\cdot\\frac{-1-5\\sqrt{5}}{2}=\\frac{-56(1-25\\cdot5)}{4}=\\boxed{1736}.\\]",
