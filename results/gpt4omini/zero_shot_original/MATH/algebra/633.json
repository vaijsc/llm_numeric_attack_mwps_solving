        "To find the coordinates of the other endpoint of the line segment, we can use the formula for the midpoint of a line segment. The midpoint \\( M \\) of a line segment with endpoints \\( A(x_1, y_1) \\) and \\( B(x_2, y_2) \\) is given by:\n\\[\nM = \\left( \\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \\right)\n\\]\nIn this problem, we know one endpoint \\( A(6, 8) \\) and the midpoint \\( M(1, 1) \\). We need to find the coordinates of the other endpoint \\( B(x_2, y_2) \\).\nWe can set up the equations based on the midpoint formula:\n1. For the x-coordinates:\n   \\[\n   1 = \\frac{6 + x_2}{2}\n   \\]\n   Multiply both sides by 2:\n   \\[\n   2 = 6 + x_2\n   \\]\n   Subtract 6 from both sides:\n   \\[\n   x_2 = 2 - 6 = -4\n   \\]\n2.

        "Let the coordinates of the other endpoint be \\((x, y)\\). \nWe know that the midpoint \\((M_x, M_y)\\) of a line segment with endpoints \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is calculated using the formula:\n\\[\nM_x = \\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad M_y = \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\n\\]\nIn this case, one endpoint is given as \\((x_1, y_1) = (6, 8)\\) and the midpoint is given as \\((M_x, M_y) = (1, 1)\\).\nUsing the midpoint formula for the \\(x\\) coordinate:\n\\[\n1 = \\frac{6 + x}{2}\n\\]\nTo eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by 2:\n\\[\n2 = 6 + x\n\\]\nNow, subtract 6 from both sides:\n\\[\nx = 2 - 6 = -4\n\\]\nNow, we apply the same approach for the \\(y\\) coordinate using the midpoint formula:\n\\[\n1 = \\frac{8 + y}{2}\n\\]\nAgain, multiply both sides by 2:\n\\[\n2 = 8 + y\n\\]\nSubtract 8 from both sides:\n\\[\ny = 2 - 8 = -6\n\\]\nThus, the coordinates of the other endpoint are \\((-4, -6)\\).\nNow, we need to find the sum of the coordinates of this endpoint:\n\\[\n-4 + (-6) = -4 - 6 = -10\n\\]\nTherefore, the sum of the coordinates of the other endpoint is \n\\[\n\\boxed{-10}\n\\]",
        "To find the other endpoint of the line segment given one endpoint and the midpoint, we can use the formula for finding the midpoint, which states that if we have endpoints \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\), then the coordinates of the midpoint \\((M_x, M_y)\\) are given by:\n\\[\nM_x = \\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nM_y = \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\n\\]\nLet's identify the known values:\n- One endpoint is \\((x_1, y_1) = (6, 8)\\).\n- The midpoint is \\((M_x, M_y) = (1, 1)\\).\n- The other endpoint will be \\((x_2, y_2)\\).\nNow, we will set up the equations based on the midpoint coordinates:\n1.
