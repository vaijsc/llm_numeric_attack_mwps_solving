        "To solve this problem, let's first consider the positions of the two circles. The circles are defined by:\n1. Circle \\(C_1\\) centered at \\((4, 0)\\) with radius 1.\n2. Circle \\(C_2\\) centered at \\((-4, 0)\\) with radius 1.\nThe equations of the circles are:\n\\[\nC_1: (x - 4)^2 + y^2 = 1\n\\]\n\\[\nC_2: (x + 4)^2 + y^2 = 1\n\\]\nWe want to find circles that are tangent to both \\(C_1\\) and \\(C_2\\) while also passing through the point \\((0, 5)\\).\nLet\u2019s derive a general equation for circles that are tangent to both circles. The centers of these tangential circles can be at an unknown point \\((h, k)\\). The radius of the tangential circles will be denoted as \\(r\\).\n### Step 1: Conditions of tangency\nFor the circle centered at \\((h, k)\\) with radius \\(r\\) being tangent to \\(C_1\\):\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(h - 4)^2 + k^2} = r + 1\n\\]\nFor tangency to \\(C_2\\):\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(h + 4)^2 + k^2} = r + 1\n\\]\n### Step 2: Distance equations\nBoth of these tangency conditions can be squared (to eliminate the square root) yielding:\n1. From \\(C_1\\):\n\\[\n(h - 4)^2 + k^2 = (r + 1)^2\n\\]\n2. From \\(C_2\\):\n\\[\n(h + 4)^2 + k^2 = (r + 1)^2\n\\]\n### Step 3: Combining the two equations\nSetting the right-hand sides equal since they both equal \\((r + 1)^2\\):\n\\[\n(h - 4)^2 + k^2 = (h + 4)^2 + k^2\n\\]\nIf we cancel \\(k^2\\) from both sides, we get:\n\\[\n(h - 4)^2 = (h + 4)^2\n\\]\nExpanding both sides gives:\n\\[\nh^2 - 8h + 16 = h^2 + 8h + 16\n\\]\nSimplifying leads to:\n\\[\n-8h = 8h \\implies -16h = 0 \\implies h = 0\n\\]\n### Step 4: Finding \\(k\\) and \\(r\\)\nNow, we know the center of the circles must be \\((0, k)\\). Therefore, substituting \\(h = 0\\) back into the condition for tangency gives us:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(0 - 4)^2 + k^2} = r + 1\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sqrt{16 + k^2} = r + 1\n\\]\nThis implies:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(0 + 4)^2 + k^2} = r + 1\n\\]\nBoth conditions are basically the same now. We can simplify:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{16 + k^2} = r + 1\n\\]\n### Step 5: Circles passing through \\((0, 5)\\)\nFor the circle centered at \\((0, k)\\) with radius \\(r\\) to pass through \\((0, 5)\\):\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(0 - 0)^2 + (k - 5)^2} = r\n\\]\nThis implies:\n\\[\n|k - 5| = r\n\\]\n### Step 6: Equating and deriving quadratic equations\nFrom our tangency condition:\n\\[\nr = \\sqrt{16 + k^2} - 1\n\\]\nSubstituting \\(r\\) we get:\n\\[\n|k - 5| = \\sqrt{16 + k^2} - 1\n\\]\nThis results in two possible cases:\n**Case 1**: \\(k - 5 = \\sqrt{16 + k^2} - 1\\)  \n**Case 2**: \\(5 - k = \\sqrt{16 + k^2} - 1\\)\n### Case 1 Simplification:\n1. \\(k - 5 + 1 = \\sqrt{16 + k^2}\\)\n2. \\(k - 4 = \\sqrt{16 + k^2}\\)\n3. Squaring both sides results in \\(k^2 - 8k + 16 = 16 + k^2 \\Rightarrow -8k = 0 \\Rightarrow k = 0\\).\n### Case 2 Simplification:\n1. \\(5 - k + 1 = \\sqrt{16 + k^2}\\)\n2. \\(6 - k = \\sqrt{16 + k^2}\\)\n3. Squaring both sides yields \\(k^2 - 12k + 36 = 16 + k^2\\) which simplifies to \\(-12k + 20 = 0\\).\n4. Thus, \\(k = \\frac{20}{12} = \\frac{5}{3}\\).\nSo we have two circles, one for \\(k = 0\\) and one for \\(k = \\frac{5}{3}\\). Each case provides a unique circle.\n### Final Count\nSince both cases yield distinct positions for \\(k\\) yielding valid configuration of circles, the number of circles that satisfy all the conditions is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).",
        "We begin by analyzing the two circles given in the problem. The first circle \\( C_1 \\) is centered at \\( (4, 0) \\) with radius \\( 1 \\), and the second circle \\( C_2 \\) is centered at \\( (-4, 0) \\) also with radius \\( 1 \\). Their equations can be written as follows:\n\\[\nC_1: (x - 4)^2 + y^2 = 1\n\\]\n\\[\nC_2: (x + 4)^2 + y^2 = 1\n\\]\nNext, we want to find circles that are tangent to both \\( C_1 \\) and \\( C_2 \\) and also pass through the point \\( (0, 5) \\). \nLet\u2019s denote the center of a tangent circle as \\( (h, k) \\) with radius \\( r \\). The conditions for tangency to \\( C_1 \\) and \\( C_2 \\) can be represented mathematically. For it to be tangent to \\( C_1 \\):\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(h - 4)^2 + k^2} = r + 1\n\\]\nFor it to be tangent to \\( C_2 \\):\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(h + 4)^2 + k^2} = r + 1\n\\]\nAdditionally, since the circle passes through \\( (0, 5) \\), we have:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(h - 0)^2 + (k - 5)^2} = r\n\\]\n### Step 1: Set Up the Tangency Equations\nWe square the tangency equations to eliminate the square roots:\n1. From the tangency with \\( C_1 \\):\n\\[\n(h - 4)^2 + k^2 = (r + 1)^2\n\\]\n2. From the tangency with \\( C_2 \\):\n\\[\n(h + 4)^2 + k^2 = (r + 1)^2\n\\]\n### Step 2: Equate the Two Conditions\nSince both equations equal \\( (r + 1)^2 \\), we can set them equal to each other:\n\\[\n(h - 4)^2 + k^2 = (h + 4)^2 + k^2\n\\]\nThe \\( k^2 \\) terms cancel out:\n\\[\n(h - 4)^2 = (h + 4)^2\n\\]\nNext, we expand both sides:\n\\[\nh^2 - 8h + 16 = h^2 + 8h + 16\n\\]\nBy simplifying, we obtain:\n\\[\n-8h = 8h \\implies -16h = 0 \\implies h = 0\n\\]\n### Step 3: Substitute Back to Find \\( k \\) and \\( r \\)\nNow substitute \\( h = 0 \\) into one of the tangency conditions. We can choose the condition with \\( C_1 \\):\n\\[\n(0 - 4)^2 + k^2 = (r + 1)^2\n\\]\n\\[\n16 + k^2 = (r + 1)^2 \\tag{1}\n\\]\nNow substituting \\( h = 0 \\) into the point condition:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(0 - 0)^2 + (k - 5)^2} = r \\implies |k - 5| = r\n\\]\nThus, we can square it to eliminate the absolute value:\n\\[\n(k - 5)^2 = r^2 \\tag{2}\n\\]\n### Step 4: Substitute to Solve \\( k \\)\nSubstituting \\( r \\) from equation (2) back to equation (1):\n\\[\n16 + k^2 = (|k - 5| + 1)^2\n\\]\nNow we have two cases based on \\( |k - 5| \\):\n1. **Case 1**: \\( k - 5 \\geq 0 \\) (i.e., \\( k \\geq 5 \\))\n   \\[\n   |k - 5| = k - 5 \\implies r = k - 5 \\implies r + 1 = k - 4\n   \\]\n   Plugging this in gives:\n   \\[\n   16 + k^2 = (k - 4)^2 \\implies 16 + k^2 = k^2 - 8k + 16\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( k \\):\n   \\[\n   0 = -8k \\implies k = 0 \\text{ (not valid since \\( k \\geq 5 \\))}\n   \\]\n2. **Case 2**: \\( k - 5 < 0 \\) (i.e., \\( k < 5 \\))\n   \\[\n   |k - 5| = 5 - k \\implies r = 5 - k \\implies r + 1 = 6 - k\n   \\]\n   Plugging this in gives:\n   \\[\n   16 + k^2 = (6 - k)^2\n   \\]\n   This expands and simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   16 + k^2 = 36 - 12k + k^2 \\implies 12k = 20 \\implies k = \\frac{20}{12} = \\frac{5}{3}.\n   \\]\n   And from substituting \\( k = \\frac{5}{3} \\) back into \\( r = 5 - k \\):\n   \\[\n   r = 5 - \\frac{5}{3} = \\frac{15}{3} - \\frac{5}{3} = \\frac{10}{3}.\n   \\]\n### Final Step: Finding Circles That Fit These Conditions\nNow that we have \\( k = \\frac{5}{3} \\) and \\( r = \\frac{10}{3} \\), we can find the circles. The original \\( k \\) leads to one tangential position above the horizontal line, while the shadow that results leads to circles tangent below. \nThus, the circle properties show a total of **two distinct circles**, leading us to state that the total number of tangent circles to both given conditions is \\( \\boxed{2} \\).",
        "To solve the problem, we start by identifying the two circles given in the problem.\n1. **Circle Definitions**:\n   - The first circle is centered at \\( (4, 0) \\) with radius \\( 1 \\), which can be defined by the equation:\n     \\[\n     (x - 4)^2 + y^2 = 1\n     \\]\n   - The second circle is centered at \\( (-4, 0) \\) with the same radius \\( 1 \\), defined by the equation:\n     \\[\n     (x + 4)^2 + y^2 = 1\n     \\]\n2. **Understanding Tangency**:\n   A circle that is tangent to both of these circles must be at a distance equal to the radius, \\( 1 \\), from each circle's center. Therefore, if we denote the center of the sought circle as \\( (h, k) \\) and its radius as \\( r \\), then the distance from \\( (h, k) \\) to the centers of the two circles must satisfy:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{(h - 4)^2 + k^2} = r + 1\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{(h + 4)^2 + k^2} = r + 1\n   \\]\n3. **Passing through a point**:\n   The circles must also pass through the point \\( (0, 5) \\). The distance from the center \\( (h, k) \\) to this point must equal the radius, \\( r \\), so we have:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{(h - 0)^2 + (k - 5)^2} = r\n   \\]\n4. **Equating the Radius**:\n   Now we need to express \\( r \\) in terms of \\( h \\) and \\( k \\) using the tangency conditions. We will square both sides of the equations to avoid dealing with square roots initially:\n   \\[\n   (h - 4)^2 + k^2 = (r + 1)^2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   (h + 4)^2 + k^2 = (r + 1)^2\n   \\]\n   Thus we can set the left-hand sides equal to each other:\n   \\[\n   (h - 4)^2 = (h + 4)^2\n   \\]\n   Expanding both sides:\n   \\[\n   h^2 - 8h + 16 = h^2 + 8h + 16\n   \\]\n   Simplifying gives us:\n   \\[\n   -8h = 8h \\implies -16h = 0 \\implies h = 0\n   \\]\n5. **Finding k**:\n   Since \\( h = 0 \\), we can substitute \\( h \\) into either of the previous equations to find \\( k \\):\n   \\[\n   (0 - 4)^2 + k^2 = (r + 1)^2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   16 + k^2 = (r + 1)^2\n   \\]\n   From the other equation:\n   \\[\n   (0 + 4)^2 + k^2 = (r + 1)^2\n   \\]\n   It leads to the same expression. Now substituting the distance to the point \\( (0, 5) \\):\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{(0 - 0)^2 + (k - 5)^2} = r\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   |k - 5| = r\n   \\]\n6. **Expressing r**:\n   From \\( r \\) we can express:\n   \\[\n   r = k - 5 \\quad \\text{if } k \\geq 5\n   \\]\n   or\n   \\[\n   r = 5 - k \\quad \\text{if } k < 5\n   \\]\n7. **Final Equations**:\n   Substituting \\( r \\) back into our earlier equation gives:\n   For \\( k \\geq 5 \\):\n   \\[\n   16 + k^2 = (k - 5 + 1)^2 \\Rightarrow 16 + k^2 = (k - 4)^2\n   \\]\n   This expands to:\n   \\[\n   16 + k^2 = k^2 - 8k + 16 \\implies 8k = 0 \\implies k = 0 \n   \\]\n   A contradiction arises.\n   For \\( k < 5 \\):\n   \\[\n   16 + k^2 = (5 - k + 1)^2 \\Rightarrow 16 + k^2 = (6 - k)^2\n   \\]\n   Expanding and simplifying gives:\n   \\[\n   16 + k^2 = 36 - 12k + k^2 \\implies 12k = 20 \\implies k = \\frac{5}{3}\n   \\]\n8. **Final Values**:\n   If we substitute \\( k \\) back to find \\( r \\):\n   \\[\n   r = 5 - \\frac{5}{3} = \\frac{10}{3}\n   \\]\n9. **Validating the solution**:\n   Returning to the tangency conditions will utilize symmetry, both conditions need to be checked for tangency.\nGiven that both cases were approached symmetrically, we need to tally the combinations of circles where they satisfy tangency conditions derived from construction tangents to circles. There are two symmetrical points \\( (0, 4 + r) \\) on either circle for \\( k \\) and symmetrically for intersections at \\( y > 0 \\).\nThus, the final count of unique positions satisfying all conditions yields:\n- **Number of circles** \\( \\boxed{4} \\).",

Squaring the second equation:\n   \\[\n   (h + 4)^2 + k^2 = (r + 1)^2\n   \\]\n   Similarly, expanding, we have:\n   \\[\n   h^2 + 8h + 16 + k^2 = r^2 + 2r + 1\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   h^2 + k^2 - r^2 - 2r + 8h + 15 = 0 \\quad \\text{(Equation 2)}\n   \\]\n### Step 3: Subtract the equations.\nSubtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:\n\\[\n(h^2 + k^2 - r^2 - 2r + 8h + 15) - (h^2 + k^2 - r^2 - 2r - 8h + 15) = 0 \n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n16h = 0 \\implies h = 0\n\\]\n### Step 4: Substitute \\(h = 0\\) into the original equations.\nSubstituting \\(h = 0\\) into either Equation 1 or Equation 2, we use Equation 1:\n\\[\n0 + k^2 - r^2 - 2r - 0 + 15 = 0\n\\]\nThis gives:\n\\[\nk^2 - r^2 - 2r + 15 = 0 \\quad \\text{(Equation 3)}\n\\]\n### Step 5: Use the condition that the circle passes through \\( (0, 5) \\).\nSince our circle passes through the point \\( (0, 5) \\), we have:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(0 - 0)^2 + (5 - k)^2} = r\n\\]\nSquaring both sides, we have:\n\\[\n(5 - k)^2 = r^2\n\\]\nExpanding gives:\n\\[\n25 - 10k + k^2 = r^2 \\quad \\text{(Equation 4)}\n\\]\n### Step 6: Equate and solve.\nNow we can relate Equation 3 and Equation 4. From Equation 4:\n\\[\nr^2 = k^2 - 10k + 25\n\\]\nSubstituting this into Equation 3:\n\\[\nk^2 - (k^2 - 10k + 25) - 2\\sqrt{k^2 - 10k + 25} + 15 = 0\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n10k - 25 - 2\\sqrt{k^2 - 10k + 25} + 15 = 0\n\\]\nSolving further would lead to understanding the number of solutions for \\(k\\).\n### Final Conclusion:\nAfter simplification and executing calculations, there are 2 values for \\(r\\) related to different values of \\(k\\) while satisfying tangency on both circles. Thus, there are **2 circles tangent to \\(C_1\\) and \\(C_2\\) that pass through the point \\((0, 5)\\)**.\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]"
