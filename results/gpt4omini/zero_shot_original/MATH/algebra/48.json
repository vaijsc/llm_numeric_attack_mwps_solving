        "To factor the expression \\(7x^2 - 63\\), we can follow these steps:\n1. **Identify a common factor:** \n   Both terms in the expression have a common factor. We can see that \\(7\\) is a factor of both \\(7x^2\\) and \\(63\\).\n2. **Factor out the common factor:**\n   We can factor out \\(7\\) from the expression. Doing this gives us:\n   \\[\n   7(x^2 - 9)\n   \\]\n3. **Recognize the difference of squares:**\n   The expression inside the parentheses, \\(x^2 - 9\\), is a difference of squares. We can rewrite it as:\n   \\[\n   x^2 - 3^2\n   \\]\n   The difference of squares can be factored using the identity \\(a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\\).\n4. **Apply the difference of squares formula:**\n   Letting \\(a = x\\) and \\(b = 3\\), we can factor \\(x^2 - 9\\) as:\n   \\[\n   (x - 3)(x + 3)\n   \\]\n5. **Combine all parts:**\n   Now we can combine our previous work.
