    "solution": "2 p.m. New York time is noon in Denver.  45 hours past noon is 21 hours past noon the next day, which is 9 a.m. the day after that.  Think about it this way - 48 hours would mean two full days, and 45 hours is 3 hours less than that, thus, 3 hours before noon is $\\boxed{9\\text{ a.m.}}$",

        "To find the time in Denver when the train arrives, we can follow these steps:\n1. **Understanding Time Zones**: New York is in the Eastern Time Zone (ET), and Denver is in the Mountain Time Zone (MT). When it is noon in New York, it is 10 a.m. in Denver. This means there is a 2-hour time difference, with Denver being 2 hours behind New York.\n2. **Departure Time**: The train leaves New York at 2 p.m. (New York time).\n3. **Travel Duration**: The train travels for 45 hours.\n4. **Calculating Arrival Time in New York**:\n   - Since the train leaves at 2 p.m. on Day 1 in New York, we need to add the 45 hours of travel.\n   - 24 hours from 2 p.m. brings us to 2 p.m. the next day (Day 2).\n   - Then, we have 21 more hours to account for (since 45 - 24 = 21).\n   - Adding 21 hours to 2 p.m. on Day 2:\n     - From 2 p.m., adding 12 hours takes us to 2 a.m. on Day 3,\n     - Then, adding the remaining 9 hours takes us to 11 a.m. on Day 3.\n   Thus, the train arrives in New York at 11 a.m. on Day 3.\n5. **Converting Arrival Time to Denver Time**:\n   - Since Denver is 2 hours behind New York, we need to subtract 2 hours from the New York arrival time.\n   - 11 a.m. New York time minus 2 hours gives us 9 a.m. in Denver.\nTherefore, the train arrives in Denver at **9 a.m.** on Day 3.",
        "To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:\n1. **Determine the departure time in New York**:\n   - The train leaves New York at 2 p.m. (New York time).\n2. **Convert the departure time to Denver time**:\n   - Since New York is 2 hours ahead of Denver, when it is 2 p.m. in New York, it is:\n     \\[\n     2 \\, \\text{p.m.} - 2 \\, \\text{hours} = 12 \\, \\text{p.m. (noon)} \\, \\text{in Denver}\n     \\]\n3. **Calculate the travel time**:\n   - The train takes 45 hours to travel to Denver.\n4. **Add the travel time to the departure time in Denver**:\n   - Starting from 12 p.m. (noon) in Denver, we add 45 hours:\n     - First, add 24 hours (1 day):\n       \\[\n       12 \\, \\text{p.m. (noon)} + 24 \\, \\text{hours} = 12 \\, \\text{p.m. (noon)} \\, \\text{the next day}\n       \\]\n     - Next, add the remaining 21 hours:\n       \\[\n       12 \\, \\text{p.m.} + 21 \\, \\text{hours} = 9 \\, \\text{a.m.} \\, \\text{the day after that}\n       \\]\n5. **Final time in Denver when the train arrives**:\n   - Therefore, the train arrives in Denver at:\n     \\[\n     9 \\, \\text{a.m.} \\, \\text{two days after the departure}\n     \\]\nSo, when the train arrives in Denver, it is **9 a.m.** in Denver.",
        "To determine what time it is in Denver when the train leaves New York and arrives in Denver 45 hours later, we can follow these steps:\n1. **Train Departure Time (New York Time)**: The train departs New York at 2 p.m. New York time.\n2. **Convert Departure Time to Denver Time**: Since New York is 2 hours ahead of Denver, when it\u2019s 2 p.m. in New York, it is:\n   \\[\n   2:00 \\, \\text{p.m.} - 2 \\, \\text{hours} = 12:00 \\, \\text{p.m. (Noon)} \\, \\text{(Denver time)}\n   \\]\n3. **Train Travel Duration**: The train travels for 45 hours.\n4. **Calculate Arrival Time in Denver Time**:\n   - Start from the Denver time when the train departs: 12:00 p.m. (noon).\n   - Add 45 hours to this time:\n     - Adding 24 hours takes us to the next day at 12:00 p.m. (noon).\n     - Remaining hours to add: \n       \\[\n       45 \\, \\text{hours} - 24 \\, \\text{hours} = 21 \\, \\text{hours}\n       \\]\n     - Adding an additional 21 hours to 12:00 p.m. (the next day):\n       - 12:00 p.m. + 12 hours = 12:00 a.m. (midnight, the next day)\n       - 12:00 a.m. + 9 hours = 9:00 a.m.\n5. **Conclusion**: Therefore, when the train arrives in Denver, the time will be:\n   \\[\n   \\text{9:00 a.m. (Denver time)}\n   \\] \nThus, the final answer is **9:00 a.m. in Denver when the train arrives**.",
        "To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the train's departure time in Denver time, then determine how long the train journey takes in New York time, and finally convert the arrival time to Denver time.\n1. **Calculate Departure Time in Denver Time:**\n   - The train leaves New York at 2 p.m. New York time.\n   - Since New York is 2 hours ahead of Denver, we need to convert 2 p.m. NY time to Denver time.\n   - 2 p.m. NY time is:\n     \\[\n     2 \\text{ p.m.} - 2 \\text{ hours} = 12 \\text{ p.m. (noon)} \\text{ (Denver time)}\n     \\]\n2. **Calculate the Duration of the Train Journey:**\n   - The train journey lasts for 45 hours.\n3. **Calculate the Arrival Time in Denver Time:**\n   - If the train departs at 12 p.m. Denver time, we add the journey duration of 45 hours.\n   - To do this, we can break it down:\n     - 24 hours after 12 p.m. is 12 p.m. the next day.\n     - We still need to account for an additional 21 hours (since 45 - 24 = 21).\n       - 21 hours after 12 p.m. is:\n       \\[\n       12 \\text{ p.m.} + 21 \\text{ hours} = 9 \\text{ a.m. (next day)}\n       \\]\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The train arrives in Denver at **9 a.m.** the next day.\n   \nThus, the time in Denver when the train arrives is **9 a.m.**.",
        "To solve the problem, let's go step by step:\n1. **Understanding the Time Zones**:\n   - When it is noon in New York, it is 10 a.m. in Denver. This means that New York is 2 hours ahead of Denver.\n2. **Train Departure Time**:\n   - The train leaves New York at 2 p.m. New York time.\n3. **Travel Duration**:\n   - The journey takes 45 hours.\n4. **Calculating the Arrival Time in New York Time**:\n   - We need to calculate what time it will be in New York when the train arrives after 45 hours.\n   - Starting at 2 p.m., we add 45 hours.\n   - 24 hours from 2 p.m. leads us to 2 p.m. the next day (one full day later).\n   - That leaves 21 hours remaining (45 - 24 = 21).\n   - Adding 21 hours to 2 p.m. gives:\n     - 2 p.m. + 12 hours = 2 a.m. (the next day),\n     - Then add 9 more hours: 2 a.m. + 9 hours = 11 a.m.\n   - So, the train arrives in New York time at 11 a.m. two days after it departed.\n5. **Converting to Denver Time**:\n   - Now, we convert this arrival time to Denver time.\n   - Since New York is 2 hours ahead, we subtract 2 hours from 11 a.m. New York time:\n     - 11 a.m. - 2 hours = 9 a.m. Denver time.\n6. **Final Answer**:\n   - Therefore, when the train arrives in Denver, it is **9 a.m.**"
