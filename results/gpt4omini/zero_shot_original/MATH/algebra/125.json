        "Let's analyze the problem step by step.\n1. **Understand the Climb Pattern**:\n   The airplane climbs a certain number of feet in the first second, and in each second after that, it climbs an additional 100 feet compared to the previous second. \n   - At t = 1 second, the climb is 100 feet.\n   - At t = 2 seconds, the climb is 200 feet (100 feet + 100 feet).\n   - At t = 3 seconds, the climb is 300 feet (200 feet + 100 feet).\n   - In general, at t seconds, the climb is \\( 100t \\) feet.\n2. **Calculate Total Climb Over Time**:\n   We need to find the total altitude gain after \\( n \\) seconds. The total altitude climb \\( S_n \\) can be represented by the sum of an arithmetic series:\n   \\[\n   S_n = 100 + 200 + 300 + \\ldots + 100n\n   \\]\n   This series can be factored:\n   \n   \\[\n   S_n = 100(1 + 2 + 3 + \\ldots + n) = 100 \\cdot \\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\n   \\]\n   Thus, the total climb after \\( n \\) seconds is:\n   \\[\n   S_n = 50n(n + 1)\n   \\]\n3. **Set Up the Equation**:\n   We want to find \\( n \\) such that the total climb \\( S_n \\) equals 12,000 feet:\n   \\[\n   50n(n + 1) = 12000\n   \\]\n4. **Simplify the Equation**:\n   Divide both sides by 50:\n   \\[\n   n(n + 1) = 240\n   \\]\n5. **Form a Quadratic Equation**:\n   Rearranging this gives:\n   \\[\n   n^2 + n - 240 = 0\n   \\]\n6. **Solve the Quadratic Equation**:\n   We can use the quadratic formula \\( n = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\), where \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 1 \\), and \\( c = -240 \\).\n   \\[\n   n = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (-240)}}{2 \\cdot 1} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 960}}{2} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{961}}{2}\n   \\]\n   Since \\( \\sqrt{961} = 31 \\):\n   \\[\n   n = \\frac{-1 + 31}{2} \\quad \\text{(taking the positive root)}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   n = \\frac{30}{2} = 15\n   \\]\n7. **Check the Solution**:\n   To confirm, substitute \\( n = 15 \\) back into the climbing formula:\n   \\[\n   S_{15} = 50(15)(15 + 1) = 50(15)(16) = 50 \\cdot 240 = 12000\n   \\]\n   This verifies that the calculation is correct.\n### Conclusion:\nIt takes **15 seconds** for the airplane to reach an altitude of 12,000 feet above its takeoff height.",
