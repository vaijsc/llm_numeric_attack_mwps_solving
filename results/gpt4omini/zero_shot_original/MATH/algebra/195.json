        "To find the domain of the expression \\(\\sqrt{6 - x - x^2}\\), we need to ensure that the expression inside the square root is non-negative, because the square root function is only defined for non-negative numbers. Thus, we set up the inequality:\n\\[\n6 - x - x^2 \\geq 0\n\\]\nRearranging this gives us:\n\\[\n-x^2 - x + 6 \\geq 0\n\\]\nTo make it more straightforward, we can multiply through by -1 (which reverses the inequality):\n\\[\nx^2 + x - 6 \\leq 0\n\\]\nNext, we need to factor the quadratic \\(x^2 + x - 6\\). We want two numbers that multiply to \\(-6\\) and add to \\(1\\). The numbers \\(3\\) and \\(-2\\) work:\n\\[\nx^2 + x - 6 = (x - 2)(x + 3)\n\\]\nNow, we set up our inequality:\n\\[\n(x - 2)(x + 3) \\leq 0\n\\]\nNext, we find the critical points by setting each factor to zero:\n1. \\(x - 2 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 2\\)\n2. \\(x + 3 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = -3\\)\nThese critical points divide the number line into intervals.
