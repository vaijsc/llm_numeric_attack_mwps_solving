        "To determine the degree of the polynomial \\( f(x) + g(x) \\), where both \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) are polynomials of degree 7, we need to consider the behavior of the degrees of the sum of two polynomials.\n1. **Identifying the degrees:**\n   - The degree of \\( f(x) \\) is 7.\n   - The degree of \\( g(x) \\) is also 7.\n2. **Understanding the sum of polynomials:**\n   - The degree of the sum \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) will depend on the leading coefficients of \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\).\n   - If the leading coefficients (the coefficients of \\( x^7 \\)) of both polynomials are non-zero and distinct, the degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) will be the maximum of the degrees of \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\), which is 7.\n   - If the leading coefficients are equal and non-zero, then they will combine and yield a polynomial of degree 6 (if the leading term cancels).\n3. **Maximum and Minimum Degrees:**\n   - **Maximum Degree**: The maximum possible degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) is 7, which occurs when the leading coefficients do not cancel each other out.\n   - **Minimum Degree**: The minimum possible degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) is 6, which occurs when the leading coefficients of \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) are equal and non-zero, causing the leading term to cancel.\n4. **Calculating the product**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Maximum degree} = 7\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Minimum degree} = 6\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Product of the minimum and maximum degrees} = 7 \\times 6 = 42\n   \\]\nThus, the product of the minimum and the maximum possible degrees of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) is \\(\\boxed{42}\\).",
        "To analyze the degrees of the polynomial sum \\( f(x) + g(x) \\), we need to consider the degrees of the individual polynomials \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\).\n1. **Given Information**:\n   - The polynomial \\( f(x) \\) has degree 7, denoted as \\( \\deg(f) = 7 \\).\n   - The polynomial \\( g(x) \\) also has degree 7, denoted as \\( \\deg(g) = 7 \\).\n2. **Maximum Degree of the Sum**:\n   - The maximum degree of the sum \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) occurs when the leading coefficients of \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) do not cancel each other out.\n   - Mathematically, this occurs when the leading terms of both \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) are such that \\( a_7 + b_7 \\neq 0 \\), where \\( a_7 \\) and \\( b_7 \\) are the leading coefficients of \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\), respectively.\n   - Therefore, the maximum degree is:\n   \\[\n   \\deg(f + g) = 7\n   \\]\n3. **Minimum Degree of the Sum**:\n   - The minimum degree of the sum \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) occurs when the leading coefficients of \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) cancel each other out, i.e., \\( a_7 + b_7 = 0 \\).

        "To determine the degrees of the polynomial \\( f(x) + g(x) \\), where \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) are both polynomials of degree 7, we must consider the properties of polynomial addition.\n1. **Understanding Polynomial Degrees**:\n   - The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of the variable in it. Thus, a polynomial of degree 7 can be expressed in the form:\n     \\[\n     f(x) = a_7x^7 + a_6x^6 + \\ldots + a_0\n     \\]\n     where \\( a_7 \\neq 0 \\) and similarly for \\( g(x) \\).\n2. **Adding the Polynomials**:\n   - When we add the two polynomials \\( f(x) + g(x) \\), we get:\n     \\[\n     f(x) + g(x) = (a_7 + b_7)x^7 + (a_6 + b_6)x^6 + \\ldots + (a_0 + b_0\n     \\]\n     where \\( b_7 \\) is the leading coefficient of \\( g(x) \\).\n3. **Determining the Degree**:\n   - The degree of the sum \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) typically depends on the leading coefficients \\( a_7 \\) and \\( b_7 \\):\n     - If \\( a_7 + b_7 \\neq 0 \\), the degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) is 7.\n     - If \\( a_7 + b_7 = 0 \\), then the leading term cancels out, and the degree would be determined by the next highest degree terms.\n4. **Applications of Degree Cancellation**:\n   - The cases for cancellation could lead to degrees lower than 7. The possible maximum degree remains 7, but the minimum could drop depending on how many leading coefficients cancel out.\n   - If both leading terms cancel (i.e., both \\( a_7 = 0 \\) and \\( b_7 = 0 \\)), we look to the next terms until we find a non-zero coefficient. In the worst case where all 7 leading terms can cancel, the next possible degree could be as low as 0, if the next non-zero terms in both polynomials are canceled completely.\n5. **Degrees of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\)**:\n   - Thus, the maximum possible degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) is 7, and the minimum possible degree can be 0 if all terms cancel.\n  \n6. **Calculating the Product**:\n   - Therefore, the minimum and maximum possible degrees are:\n     - Minimum degree = 0\n     - Maximum degree = 7\nFinally, the product of these degrees is:\n\\[\n0 \\times 7 = 0\n\\]\nThus, the answer is \\( \\boxed{0} \\).",
        "To analyze the degrees of the sum of two polynomials, we begin by recalling some properties of polynomial degrees.\n1. **Degrees of Polynomials**: If \\( f(x) \\) is a polynomial of degree 7, we denote this as \\( \\deg(f) = 7 \\). Similarly, for \\( g(x) \\), we have \\( \\deg(g) = 7 \\).\n2. **Sum of Polynomials**: The degree of the sum of two polynomials \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) typically depends on the leading terms of the polynomials. \n3. **Maximum Degree**: The maximum degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) occurs when the leading coefficients of \\( f \\) and \\( g \\) are non-zero and do not cancel each other. In this case, the degree of the sum is:\n   \\[\n   \\deg(f + g) = \\max(\\deg(f), \\deg(g)) = 7\n   \\]\n   Thus, the maximum possible degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) is 7.\n4. **Minimum Degree**: The minimum degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) occurs when the leading terms perfectly cancel each other out. This means that if the leading terms of \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) have the same degree and their coefficients are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign, the leading term cancels, potentially lowering the degree of the resulting polynomial.\n   Let's denote the leading term of \\( f(x) \\) as \\( a_7 x^7 \\) and of \\( g(x) \\) as \\( b_7 x^7 \\). If \\( a_7 + b_7 = 0 \\) (i.e., \\( b_7 = -a_7 \\)), the degree of the polynomial could decrease. If there are no other terms of degree 7 (i.e., if both polynomials have leading terms that cancel and the next leading term has a degree less than 7), the degree of the sum \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) would be less than 7.\n   The smallest possible degree in this situation can reach down to 0 if all higher terms cancel out and what remains is a non-zero constant. Thus, the minimum possible degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) is 0.\n5. **Final Calculation**: The degrees of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) can therefore range from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 7. \nFinally, we are asked for the product of the minimum and maximum possible degrees of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\):\n\\[\n\\text{Product} = \\text{Minimum Degree} \\times \\text{Maximum Degree} = 0 \\times 7 = 0\n\\]\nThus, the answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\]",
        "To determine the minimum and maximum possible degrees of the polynomial expression \\( f(x) + g(x) \\), we first consider the properties of the degrees of polynomials.\n1. **Degree of Each Polynomial**: \n   Given that both \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) are polynomials of degree 7, we denote:\n   \\[\n   \\deg(f) = 7 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\deg(g) = 7\n   \\]\n2. **Degree of Their Sum**:\n   The degree of the sum of two polynomials can be significantly influenced by the leading terms (the terms with the highest degree) of each polynomial. \n   Specifically, the degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\deg(f + g) = \\max(\\deg(f), \\deg(g))\n   \\]\n   unless the leading terms exactly cancel each other out.\n3. **Maximum Degree**:\n   Since both \\( f \\) and \\( g \\) are of degree 7, if there is no cancellation of the leading terms (i.e., the coefficients of \\( x^7 \\) in both \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) do not negate each other), then:\n   \\[\n   \\deg(f + g) = \\max(7, 7) = 7\n   \\]\n   This is the maximum degree of the sum.\n4. **Minimum Degree**:\n   For the minimum degree of \\( f + g \\), we must consider the scenario where the leading terms do cancel each other out. This occurs if the coefficients of the \\( x^7 \\) term in both \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) are equal in magnitude and opposite in sign. In that case, the next largest degree term dictates the degree of the sum.\n   Hence, if the leading coefficients cancel, the degree of \\( f + g \\) will then be:\n   \\[\n   \\deg(f + g) = 6\n   \\]\n   This is the minimum degree.\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   We have established that:\n   - The maximum possible degree of \\( f + g \\) is \\( 7 \\).\n   - The minimum possible degree of \\( f + g \\) is \\( 6 \\).\nFinally, we need to find the product of these minimum and maximum degrees:\n\\[\n\\text{Product} = 6 \\times 7 = 42\n\\]\nThus, the answer is \n\\[\n\\boxed{42}\n\\]"
