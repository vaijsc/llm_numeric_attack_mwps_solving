        "To find the total number of chimes the clock strikes in a twelve-hour period, we will sum up the number of chimes for each hour from 1 o'clock to 12 o'clock.\nLet's break it down hour by hour:\n1. At 1 o'clock, the clock strikes 1 chime.\n2. At 2 o'clock, it strikes 2 chimes.\n3. At 3 o'clock, it strikes 3 chimes.\n4. At 4 o'clock, it strikes 4 chimes.\n5. At 5 o'clock, it strikes 5 chimes.\n6. At 6 o'clock, it strikes 6 chimes.\n7. At 7 o'clock, it strikes 7 chimes.\n8. At 8 o'clock, it strikes 8 chimes.\n9. At 9 o'clock, it strikes 9 chimes.\n10. At 10 o'clock, it strikes 10 chimes.\n11. At 11 o'clock, it strikes 11 chimes.\n12. At 12 o'clock, it strikes 12 chimes.\nNow, we need to sum up these chimes:\n\\[\n1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12\n\\]\nThis sum is an arithmetic series where:\n- The first term (a) is 1,\n- The last term (l) is 12,\n- The number of terms (n) is 12.\nThe formula for the sum \\( S \\) of an arithmetic series is:\n\\[\nS = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (a + l)\n\\]\nSubstituting the values:\n\\[\nS = \\frac{12}{2} \\times (1 + 12)\n\\]\n\\[\nS = 6 \\times 13\n\\]\n\\[\nS = 78\n\\]\nTherefore, the total number of chimes the clock will strike in a twelve-hour period is \n\\[\n\\boxed{78}.\n\\]",
        "To calculate the total number of chimes struck by the clock over a twelve-hour period, we will analyze the chimes for each hour of the day from 1 o'clock to 12 o'clock.\n1. **Understanding the chime for each hour**:\n   - At 1 o'clock, the clock strikes **1** chime.\n   - At 2 o'clock, the clock strikes **2** chimes.\n   - At 3 o'clock, the clock strikes **3** chimes.\n   - At 4 o'clock, the clock strikes **4** chimes.\n   - At 5 o'clock, the clock strikes **5** chimes.\n   - At 6 o'clock, the clock strikes **6** chimes.\n   - At 7 o'clock, the clock strikes **7** chimes.\n   - At 8 o'clock, the clock strikes **8** chimes.\n   - At 9 o'clock, the clock strikes **9** chimes.\n   - At 10 o'clock, the clock strikes **10** chimes.\n   - At 11 o'clock, the clock strikes **11** chimes.\n   - At 12 o'clock, the clock strikes **12** chimes.\n2. **Summing the chimes**:\n   Now, we need to find the total chimes struck from 1 to 12. This can be computed using the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers, which is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum} = \\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\n   \\]\n   In this case, \\( n = 12 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum} = \\frac{12(12 + 1)}{2} = \\frac{12 \\times 13}{2} = \\frac{156}{2} = 78\n   \\]\n3. **Final total**:\n   Therefore, over a twelve-hour period, the total number of chimes struck by the clock is **78**.\nThus, the total number of chimes the clock will strike in a twelve-hour period is \\( \\boxed{78} \\).",
        "To determine the total number of chimes the clock strikes in a twelve-hour period, we can break it down according to how many chimes are struck at each hour:\n- At 1 o'clock, the clock strikes 1 chime.\n- At 2 o'clock, it strikes 2 chimes.\n- At 3 o'clock, it strikes 3 chimes.\n- At 4 o'clock, it strikes 4 chimes.\n- At 5 o'clock, it strikes 5 chimes.\n- At 6 o'clock, it strikes 6 chimes.\n- At 7 o'clock, it strikes 7 chimes.\n- At 8 o'clock, it strikes 8 chimes.\n- At 9 o'clock, it strikes 9 chimes.\n- At 10 o'clock, it strikes 10 chimes.\n- At 11 o'clock, it strikes 11 chimes.\n- At 12 o'clock, it strikes 12 chimes.\nNow, we can sum these chimes together:\n\\[\n1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12\n\\]\nThis sum can be calculated using the formula for the sum of the first \\( n \\) integers:\n\\[\n\\text{Sum} = \\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\n\\]\nIn our case, \\( n = 12 \\):\n\\[\n\\text{Sum} = \\frac{12(12 + 1)}{2} = \\frac{12 \\times 13}{2} = \\frac{156}{2} = 78\n\\]\nTherefore, the total number of chimes the clock strikes in a twelve-hour period is \\( \\boxed{78} \\).",
        "To find the total number of chimes the clock strikes in a twelve-hour period, we can break it down step by step.\n1. **Understanding the chimes for each hour:**  \n   - At 1 o'clock, the clock chimes 1 time.\n   - At 2 o'clock, the clock chimes 2 times.\n   - At 3 o'clock, the clock chimes 3 times.\n   - ...\n   - At 12 o'clock, the clock chimes 12 times.\n2. **Listing the total chimes for each hour:**  \n   The number of chimes for each hour from 1 to 12 can be represented as the sequence:  \n   1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.\n3. **Calculating the total chimes:**  \n   To find the total number of chimes, we need to sum these values:  \n   \\[\n   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12.\n   \\]\n4. **Using the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers:**  \n   The sum of the first n natural numbers can be calculated using the formula:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum} = \\frac{n(n + 1)}{2},\n   \\]  \n   where n is the largest number in the series.
