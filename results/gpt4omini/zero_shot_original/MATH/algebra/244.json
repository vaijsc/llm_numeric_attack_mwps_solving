        "To determine how many distinct arithmetic sequences meet the specified conditions, we start with the properties of an arithmetic sequence. An arithmetic sequence is defined by its first term \\(a_1\\), common difference \\(d\\), and the \\(n\\)-th term \\(a_n\\) can be expressed as:\n\\[\na_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\n\\]\nIn our case, we know:\n- The first term \\(a_1 = 1\\)\n- Another term of the sequence is \\(91\\)\nSubstituting \\(a_1\\) into the equation, we have:\n\\[\na_n = 1 + (n-1)d\n\\]\nWe need \\(a_n = 91\\) for some integer \\(n\\). Setting up the equation, we obtain:\n\\[\n1 + (n-1)d = 91\n\\]\nSubtracting 1 from both sides gives:\n\\[\n(n-1)d = 90\n\\]\nFrom this, we derive:\n\\[\nd = \\frac{90}{n-1}\n\\]\nTo find valid sequences, we need \\(n-1\\) to be a divisor of \\(90\\), since \\(d\\) must be an integer. Thus, we need to consider the divisors of \\(90\\).\n### Step 1: Finding Divisors of 90\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of \\(90\\):\n\\[\n90 = 2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5\n\\]\nUsing this, we can calculate the number of divisors. The formula for the number of divisors, given the prime factorization \\(p_1^{e_1} \\times p_2^{e_2} \\times ...\\), is:\n\\[\n(e_1+1)(e_2+1)(e_3+1) \\ldots\n\\]\nFor \\(90 = 2^1 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^1\\):\n- \\(e_1 = 1 \\rightarrow e_1 + 1 = 2\\)\n- \\(e_2 = 2 \\rightarrow e_2 + 1 = 3\\)\n- \\(e_3 = 1 \\rightarrow e_3 + 1 = 2\\)\nThus:\n\\[\n(1+1)(2+1)(1+1) = 2 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 12\n\\]\n### Step 2: Identifying \\(n\\) and \\(d\\)\nThe divisors of \\(90\\) are:\n\\[\n1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 15, 30, 45, 90\n\\]\nEach divisor \\(k\\) leads to a corresponding \\(n\\) by the relation \\(n - 1 = k\\). Thus, we find \\(n\\) values as:\n\\[\nn = k + 1\n\\]\nWhere \\(k\\) is a divisor of \\(90\\).\n### Step 3: Collecting Values for \\(d\\)\nFrom our equation \\(d = \\frac{90}{n-1}\\), each divisor \\(k\\) produces a common difference \\(d = \\frac{90}{k}\\). Therefore, for each divisor, there exists a distinct arithmetic sequence defined by the values of \\(d\\).\n### Listing all values of \\(d\\)\nThe values of \\(d\\) for each divisor are:\n- For \\(k = 1: d = 90\\)\n- For \\(k = 2: d = 45\\)\n- For \\(k = 3: d = 30\\)\n- For \\(k = 5: d = 18\\)\n- For \\(k = 6: d = 15\\)\n- For \\(k = 9: d = 10\\)\n- For \\(k = 10: d = 9\\)\n- For \\(k = 15: d = 6\\)\n- For \\(k = 30: d = 3\\)\n- For \\(k = 45: d = 2\\)\n- For \\(k = 90: d = 1\\)\n### Conclusion\nEach valid divisor leads to a distinct arithmetic sequence configuration. Thus, since there are **12 divisors of \\(90\\)**, there are **12 distinct arithmetic sequences** that satisfy the conditions provided:\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{12}\n\\]",
        "To solve the problem, we start with the characteristics of an arithmetic sequence defined by its first term \\( a_1 \\), a common difference \\( d \\), and the general term defined by:\n\\[\na_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d\n\\]\nGiven that the first term \\( a_1 = 1 \\), we can rewrite the general term as:\n\\[\na_n = 1 + (n - 1)d = 1 + nd - d\n\\]\nThis can also be expressed as:\n\\[\na_n = (n - 1)d + 1\n\\]\nWe know that one of the terms of this arithmetic sequence is 91, so we can set this equal to \\( a_n \\):\n\\[\n(n - 1)d + 1 = 91\n\\]\nSubtracting 1 from both sides results in:\n\\[\n(n - 1)d = 90\n\\]\nWe can now express \\( d \\):\n\\[\nd = \\frac{90}{n - 1}\n\\]\nWe want \\( d \\) to be an integer, which means \\( n - 1 \\) must be a divisor of 90. Next, we find the divisors of 90. The prime factorization of 90 is:\n\\[\n90 = 2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5\n\\]\nTo find the total number of divisors, we can use the formula for counting divisors derived from the prime factorization. Each exponent in the factorization is increased by 1 and then multiplied:\n\\[\n(1 + 1)(2 + 1)(1 + 1) = 2 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 12\n\\]\nSo, the divisors of 90 are \\( 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 15, 18, 30, 45, 90 \\). \nNow, since \\( d = \\frac{90}{n - 1} \\), if \\( n - 1 \\) is any of these divisors, \\( n \\) will transform as follows:\n\\[\nn = \\text{divisor} + 1\n\\]\nLet's list each of the divisors and their corresponding values of \\( n \\):\n1.

All terms in the sequence are integers.\nWe can start by defining the nth-term of the arithmetic sequence.

Therefore, we find \\( k \\) by adding 1 to each divisor:\n- From 1: \\( k = 2 \\)\n- From 2: \\( k = 3 \\)\n- From 3: \\( k = 4 \\)\n- From 5: \\( k = 6 \\)\n- From 6: \\( k = 7 \\)\n- From 9: \\( k = 10 \\)\n- From 10: \\( k = 11 \\)\n- From 15: \\( k = 16 \\)\n- From 18: \\( k = 19 \\)\n- From 30: \\( k = 31 \\)\n- From 45: \\( k = 46 \\)\n- From 90: \\( k = 91 \\)\nThus, for each positive divisor of 90, we can get a distinct pair of \\( (k, d) \\). The number of distinct arithmetic sequences that meet the given conditions is equal to the number of positive divisors of 90.\nConclusively, there are **12 distinct arithmetic sequences** that meet the specified criteria.\n\\[\n\\boxed{12}\n\\]",

Substituting \\( a = 1 \\) gives us:\n\\[\na_n = 1 + (n-1)d = 1 + nd - d\n\\]\nWe can rewrite this as:\n\\[\na_n = nd - (d - 1)\n\\]\nWe know that \\( 91 \\) is a term in the sequence, so we set \\( a_n = 91 \\):\n\\[\n91 = 1 + (n-1)d\n\\]\nRearranging this leads to:\n\\[\n90 = (n-1)d\n\\]\nThus, we have the equation:\n\\[\n(n-1)d = 90\n\\]\nTo find the number of distinct sequences, we need to determine all pairs \\( (n-1, d) \\) such that their product is \\( 90 \\). \nNext, let\u2019s find the factor pairs of \\( 90 \\):\n- The factorization of \\( 90 \\) is \\( 90 = 2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5 \\).\nNow we calculate all the factors of \\( 90 \\):\n- The factors of \\( 90 \\): \\( 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 15, 18, 30, 45, 90 \\).\nThe number of distinct factors can be calculated by adding \\( 1 \\) to each of the exponents in the prime factorization and multiplying:\n\\[\n(1+1)(2+1)(1+1) = 2 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 12\n\\]\nThis means there are \\( 12 \\) total factors of \\( 90 \\).\nSince \\( (n-1) \\) must be a positive integer, \\( n \\) must also be a positive integer \\( \\geq 2 \\).
