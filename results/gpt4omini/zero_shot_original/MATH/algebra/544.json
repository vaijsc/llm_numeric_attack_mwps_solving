    "solution": "Call the number of regular packs $r$ and the number of super packs $s$. We can use the following system of equations to represent the information given:  \\begin{align*}\nr + s &= 32 \\\\\n4r + 6s &= 166 \\\\\n\\end{align*} Multiplying the first equation by six and subtracting the second equation from that yields $(6r - 4r) + (6s - 6s) = (192 - 166)$. Solving for $r$ gives $2r = 26$, or $r = 13$. Thus, $\\boxed{13}$ regular packs were sent.",

        "Let's denote the number of regular packs as \\( r \\) and the number of super packs as \\( s \\).\nWe have two pieces of information that we can turn into equations:\n1. The total number of packs shipped:\n   \\[\n   r + s = 32\n   \\]\n2. The total number of batteries shipped:\n   \\[\n   4r + 6s = 166\n   \\]\nNow we can solve these equations step by step. \nFirst, from the first equation, we can express \\( s \\) in terms of \\( r \\):\n\\[\ns = 32 - r\n\\]\nNext, we can substitute this expression for \\( s \\) into the second equation:\n\\[\n4r + 6(32 - r) = 166\n\\]\nNow, distribute the 6:\n\\[\n4r + 192 - 6r = 166\n\\]\nCombine the \\( r \\) terms:\n\\[\n-2r + 192 = 166\n\\]\nNext, isolate \\( r \\):\n\\[\n-2r = 166 - 192\n\\]\n\\[\n-2r = -26\n\\]\nNow, divide by -2:\n\\[\nr = 13\n\\]\nSo, the number of regular packs sent is **13**. \nTo ensure our solution is correct, let's find \\( s \\) and check our total battery count:\nSubstituting back to find \\( s \\):\n\\[\ns = 32 - r = 32 - 13 = 19\n\\]\nNow, let's check the total number of batteries:\n\\[\n4r + 6s = 4(13) + 6(19) = 52 + 114 = 166\n\\]\nThe calculations confirm that the solution is correct.
