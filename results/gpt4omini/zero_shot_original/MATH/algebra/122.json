        "To find the coordinates \\((x, y)\\) given the midpoint and one endpoint of the line segment, we can use the midpoint formula. The midpoint \\(M\\) of a line segment with endpoints \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by:\n\\[\nM = \\left(\\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\\right)\n\\]\nIn this case, we know:\n- The midpoint \\(M = (3, -5)\\)\n- One endpoint \\((-9, 1)\\), denoted as \\((x_2, y_2)\\)\nWe want to find the other endpoint \\((x, y)\\) which we denote as \\((x_1, y_1)\\).\nUsing the midpoint formula, we can set up two equations, one for the x-coordinate and one for the y-coordinate.\n1.
