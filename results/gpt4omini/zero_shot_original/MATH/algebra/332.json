    "solution": "Let $x$ and $y$ be the two numbers.  We are given  \\begin{align*}\nx+y&=12\\text{, and} \\\\\nxy&=35.\n\\end{align*} Solving the first equation for $y$ and substituting into the second equation, we find $x(12-x)=35$.  Subtracting the left-hand side from both sides of the equation and distributing, we find $0=x^2-12x+35$.  We can factor the right-hand side as $(x-7)(x-5)$, so the solutions are $x=7$ and $x=5$.  Substituting either of these back into $y=12-x$, we find that the two numbers are $7$ and $5$, and their difference is $\\boxed{2}$.",

        "To find the two numbers given that their sum is 12 and their product is 35, we can set up a system of equations.\nLet the two numbers be \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n1. From the sum, we have:\n   \\[\n   x + y = 12\n   \\]\n2.
