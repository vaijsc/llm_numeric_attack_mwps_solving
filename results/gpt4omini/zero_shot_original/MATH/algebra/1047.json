        "We begin with the equation given in the problem:\n\\[\n\\frac{A\\sqrt{B}}{C} = \\frac{8}{3\\sqrt{2}}.\n\\]\nTo eliminate the fraction, we can cross-multiply to obtain:\n\\[\nA\\sqrt{B} \\cdot 3\\sqrt{2} = 8C.\n\\]\nRearranging gives us:\n\\[\nA\\sqrt{B} = \\frac{8C}{3\\sqrt{2}}.\n\\]\nLet's simplify the expression \\(\\frac{8}{3\\sqrt{2}}\\):\nMultiplying the numerator and the denominator by \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) gives:\n\\[\n\\frac{8\\sqrt{2}}{3 \\cdot 2} = \\frac{8\\sqrt{2}}{6} = \\frac{4\\sqrt{2}}{3}.\n\\]\nThus, we have:\n\\[\nA\\sqrt{B} = \\frac{4\\sqrt{2}}{3} C.\n\\]\nFrom this, we can equate both sides as follows:\n\\[\nA\\sqrt{B} = \\frac{4C\\sqrt{2}}{3}.\n\\]\nTo isolate \\(\\sqrt{B}\\), we can rewrite it as follows:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{B} = \\frac{4C\\sqrt{2}}{3A}.\n\\]\nSquaring both sides results in:\n\\[\nB = \\left(\\frac{4C\\sqrt{2}}{3A}\\right)^2 = \\frac{16C^2 \\cdot 2}{9A^2} = \\frac{32C^2}{9A^2}.\n\\]\nGiven that \\(B\\) should be a positive integer, \\(9A^2\\) must divide \\(32C^2\\). Also, since \\(B\\) has no perfect-square factors other than 1, \\(C^2\\) must take the form \\(kA^2\\) for some integer \\(k\\), ensuring that \\(B\\) remains an integer with the conditions specified.\nNext, we explore values for \\(A\\) and \\(C\\). First, note that since \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) share no common prime factors, we set \\(A = 1\\) to analyze the simplest case:\n1. If \\(A = 1\\):\nThen,\n\\[\nB = \\frac{32C^2}{9}.\n\\]\nFor \\(B\\) to be an integer, \\(32C^2\\) must be divisible by \\(9\\). Since \\(32\\) is not divisible by \\(9\\), this case is invalid.\n2. Next, let's try \\(A = 4\\):\nThen,\n\\[\nB = \\frac{32C^2}{9 \\cdot 16} = \\frac{2C^2}{9}.\n\\]\nFor \\(B\\) to remain an integer, \\(C^2\\) must be divisible by \\(9\\). Setting \\(C = 3k\\) gives \\(C^2 = 9k^2\\):\nThis yields:\n\\[\nB = \\frac{2(9k^2)}{9} = 2k^2.\n\\]\nSo we have \\(A = 4\\), \\(C = 3k\\), and \\(B = 2k^2\\).\nHowever, for \\(B\\) to have no square factors, \\(k\\) must be 1 (otherwise, \\(B\\) would contain \\(k^2\\) as a factor). Thus, we set \\(k = 1\\):\n\\[\nC = 3, \\quad B = 2 \\cdot 1^2 = 2.\n\\]\nNow we have:\n\\[\nA = 4, \\quad B = 2, \\quad C = 3.\n\\]\nNext, we verify these values:\n- \\(A = 4\\) and \\(C = 3\\) have no common prime factors.\n- \\(B = 2\\) has no perfect square factors other than 1.\nFinally, we compute \\(A + B + C\\):\n\\[\nA + B + C = 4 + 2 + 3 = 9.\n\\]\nThus, the solution to the problem is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{9}.\n\\]",
        "To solve the equation \\(\\frac{A\\sqrt{B}}{C} = \\frac{8}{3\\sqrt{2}}\\), we can start by cross-multiplying:\n\\[\nA\\sqrt{B} = C \\cdot \\frac{8}{3\\sqrt{2}}.\n\\]\nThis allows us to express \\(A\\sqrt{B}\\) in a different form. First, let's isolate the \\(\\sqrt{B}\\):\n\\[\n\\sqrt{B} = \\frac{C \\cdot 8}{3A\\sqrt{2}}.\n\\]\nNext, we can square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\\[\nB = \\left(\\frac{C \\cdot 8}{3A\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{C^2 \\cdot 64}{9A^2 \\cdot 2} = \\frac{32C^2}{9A^2}.\n\\]\nNow, since \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) are all positive integers, \\(B\\) must also be an integer.

Setting \\(k = \\frac{32C^2}{9A^2}\\), where \\(k\\) is an integer, we can express:\n\\[\nB = k.\n\\]\nFrom this, we rearrange:\n\\[\n32C^2 = 9A^2k \\quad \\text{(1)}.\n\\]\nNow, we need to ensure \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) share no factors, and \\(B\\) has no perfect square factors other than 1.\nStarting with some values, let's assume some suitable integer values for \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) such that they have no common prime factors. We will also try \\(C\\) values leading to \\(B\\) being square-free. \nLet's choose \\(A = 8\\) and \\(C = 3\\):\nCalculating \\(B\\) using (1):\n\\[\n32C^2 = 32 \\times 3^2 = 32 \\times 9 = 288,\n\\]\n\\[\n9A^2k = 9 \\times 8^2 = 9 \\times 64 = 576k.\n\\]\nSetting these equal gives:\n\\[\n288 = 576k \\Rightarrow k = \\frac{288}{576} = \\frac{1}{2}.\n\\]\nThis is not an integer. Let\u2019s try another combination, say \\(A = 3\\) and \\(C = 8\\):\nCalculating \\(B\\):\n\\[\n32C^2 = 32 \\times 8^2 = 32 \\times 64 = 2048,\n\\]\n\\[\n9A^2k = 9 \\times 3^2 = 9 \\times 9 = 81k.\n\\]\nSetting these equal yields:\n\\[\n2048 = 81k \\Rightarrow k = \\frac{2048}{81},\n\\]\nthis is also not an integer. \nLet\u2019s attempt with smaller prime factors to identify the values fitting the conditions: \\(A = 8\\) leads back to earlier check since \\(3\\) is a factor yielding complexity again.\nFinally, we can explore it. \nLet \\(A = 4\\), and consider \\(C = 3\\):\nNow computing again,\n1) Calculate \\(C\\):\n\\[\n32(3^2) = 288.\n\\]\n\\[\n9(4^2)k = 144k.\n\\]\nThen,\n\\[\n288 = 144k \\quad \\Rightarrow k = 2 \\quad \\Rightarrow B = 2.\n\\]\nThus we have \\(A = 4\\), \\(B = 2\\), \\(C = 3\\).\n**Finally:**\n\\[\nA + B + C = 4 + 2 + 3 = 9.\n\\]\nSo, \\(A + B + C = 9.\\)\nThe result for \\(A + B + C\\) is \\(\\boxed{9}\\).",
        "To solve the equation \\(\\frac{A\\sqrt{B}}{C} = \\frac{8}{3\\sqrt{2}}\\), we first multiply both sides by \\(C\\) and rearrange the equation:\n\\[\nA\\sqrt{B} = \\frac{8C}{3\\sqrt{2}}.\n\\]\nNext, we can isolate \\(\\sqrt{B}\\):\n\\[\n\\sqrt{B} = \\frac{8C}{3A\\sqrt{2}}.\n\\]\nTo eliminate the square root in the denominator, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by \\(\\sqrt{2}\\):\n\\[\n\\sqrt{B} = \\frac{8C\\sqrt{2}}{3A \\cdot 2} = \\frac{4C\\sqrt{2}}{3A}.\n\\]\nThis gives us:\n\\[\nB = \\left(\\frac{4C\\sqrt{2}}{3A}\\right)^2 = \\frac{16C^2 \\cdot 2}{9A^2} = \\frac{32C^2}{9A^2}.\n\\]\nAt this point, we know \\(B\\) must be a positive integer. For \\(B\\) to be an integer, \\(9A^2\\) must divide \\(32C^2\\). Thus, we express this condition as:\n\\[\n32C^2 = k \\cdot 9A^2,\n\\]\nfor some integer \\(k\\). Rearranging gives us:\n\\[\nB = \\frac{32C^2}{9A^2} = k.\n\\]\nNow we realize \\(B\\) should fit the conditions that it has no perfect-square factors other than 1. Let's analyze \\(B\\):\n1. Since \\(B\\) has no perfect-square factors, it must be composed of prime factors raised to the first power (or not included at all).\n2. The expression for \\(B\\) equals \\(\\frac{32C^2}{9A^2}\\).\nTo figure out \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\), we need to assume values for \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) based on their conditions. Since \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) must not share any prime factors, let's explore potential simple values of \\(C\\) related to \\(32\\) and \\(9\\).\nTrying \\(A = 4\\) and \\(C = 3\\) (no common factors):\n\\[\nA = 4 \\quad C = 3 \\implies B = \\frac{32 \\cdot 3^2}{9 \\cdot 4^2} = \\frac{32 \\cdot 9}{9 \\cdot 16} = \\frac{32}{16} = 2.\n\\]\nAt this point, values are:\n\\[\nA = 4, \\quad B = 2, \\quad C = 3.\n\\]\nChecking that \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) have no common factors confirms correctness, since 4 (which factors as \\(2^2\\)) and 3 (a prime) share none, and \\(B = 2\\) holds as being a positive integer without perfect-square factors.\nFinally, the total \\(A + B + C\\):\n\\[\nA + B + C = 4 + 2 + 3 = 9.\n\\]\nThus, the result is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{9}.\n\\]",

We will analyze \\(C^2\\) under certain conditions for divisibility. The next step is to consider the implications of the constraints given.\nGiven that \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) have no common prime factors, we will express \\(C\\) in terms of \\(K\\) for some integers. Let:\n\\[\nC = 9k \\quad \\text{for some integer } k.\n\\]\nSubstituting \\(C\\) into the equation for \\(B\\):\n\\[\nB = \\frac{32(9k)^2}{9A^2} = \\frac{32 \\times 81 k^2}{9A^2} = \\frac{288 k^2}{A^2}.\n\\]\nThus, \n\\[\nB = \\frac{288 k^2}{A^2}.\n\\]\nBoth \\(A\\) and \\(C = 9k\\) must not share any prime factors.

The integer \\(A\\) must be such that it contains factors of \\(2\\) or \\(3\\) to ensure \\(B\\) remains an integer, but controlled such that \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) share no common factors. \nNow we need \\(A\\) to be a divisor of \\(288\\). The primes must not appear in both \\(A\\) and \\(C\\). Let\u2019s choose \\(A = 8\\):\nThen, we need to check:\n\\[\nB = \\frac{288 k^2}{8^2} = \\frac{288 k^2}{64} = 4.5 k^2.\n\\]\nThis equation gives \\(k^2\\) as a fraction, so \\(K\\) must equal \\(2\\) (the minimum square), giving us:\nFor \\(k = 1\\):\n1. \\(C = 9(1) = 9\\)\n2. \\(A = 8\\)\n3. \\(B = \\frac{288}{64} = \\frac{9K^2}{4.5} = 4.5\\).\nWe need to also check for the validity of complete integers \\(A + B + C\\). In this entirety,\nWith the \\(C\\):\nThus, values \\(A = 8\\), \\(B = 32\\), \\(C = 9\\).\nFinal summing gives:\n\\[\nA + B + C = 8 + 32 + 9 = 49.\n\\]\nThus, the final value is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{49}.\n\\]",
