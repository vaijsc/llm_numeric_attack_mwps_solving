        "To determine how many days Zeno took to paint his \\( 15 \\times 15 \\) square floor under his painting strategy, we begin by calculating the total area he needs to paint.\n1. **Calculate the total area**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width} = 15 \\, \\text{ft} \\times 15 \\, \\text{ft} = 225 \\, \\text{sq ft}\n   \\]\n2. **Understand Zeno's painting strategy**:\n   Zeno paints half of the unpainted area each day.
