        "Let the son's current age be \\( x \\). Then, the father's current age is \\( 5x \\), since today the father is five times the age of the son.\nThree years ago, the son's age would have been \\( x - 3 \\) and the father's age would have been \\( 5x - 3 \\).\nAccording to the problem, the sum of their ages three years ago was 30. This gives us the equation:\n\\[\n(x - 3) + (5x - 3) = 30\n\\]\nNow, let's simplify this equation:\n\\[\nx - 3 + 5x - 3 = 30\n\\]\n\\[\n6x - 6 = 30\n\\]\nNext, add 6 to both sides:\n\\[\n6x = 36\n\\]\nNow, divide both sides by 6:\n\\[\nx = 6\n\\]\nThus, the son's current age is \\( \\boxed{6} \\).\nTo confirm, we can calculate the father's current age. If the son is 6 years old, then the father is:\n\\[\n5 \\times 6 = 30 \\text{ years old}\n\\]\nNow, let's check their ages three years ago:\n- The son's age three years ago: \\( 6 - 3 = 3 \\)\n- The father's age three years ago: \\( 30 - 3 = 27 \\)\nThe sum of their ages three years ago:\n\\[\n3 + 27 = 30\n\\]\nThe condition is satisfied, confirming that the son's current age is indeed \\( \\boxed{6} \\).",
        "Let's define the present ages of the father and son:\n- Let the son's age today be \\( s \\).\n- Then, the father's age today is \\( 5s \\) (since the father's age is five times the son's age).\nNow, we need to express the ages three years ago:\n- The son's age three years ago was \\( s - 3 \\).\n- The father's age three years ago was \\( 5s - 3 \\).\nAccording to the problem, the sum of their ages three years ago was 30. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\\[\n(s - 3) + (5s - 3) = 30\n\\]\nSimplifying the left side:\n\\[\ns - 3 + 5s - 3 = 30\n\\]\n\\[\n6s - 6 = 30\n\\]\nNext, we can add 6 to both sides to isolate the term with \\( s \\):\n\\[\n6s = 36\n\\]\nNow, we can divide both sides by 6 to solve for \\( s \\):\n\\[\ns = 6\n\\]\nThus, the son's age today is \\( \\boxed{6} \\).\nTo verify, we can compute the father's age:\n- Father's age today: \\( 5s = 5 \\times 6 = 30 \\).\n- Three years ago:\n  - Son's age: \\( 6 - 3 = 3 \\).\n  - Father's age: \\( 30 - 3 = 27 \\).\n- The sum of their ages three years ago: \\( 3 + 27 = 30 \\).\nThe calculations confirm the information given in the problem, so the son's age is indeed \\( \\boxed{6} \\).",
        "Let the current age of the son be \\( s \\) years. According to the problem, the father's age today is \\( 5s \\) years, since the father's age is five times the son's age.\nNext, we need to analyze the information given about their ages three years ago. Three years ago, the son's age would have been \\( s - 3 \\) and the father's age would have been \\( 5s - 3 \\).\nAt that time, the sum of their ages was 30. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\\[\n(s - 3) + (5s - 3) = 30\n\\]\nNow, simplify the left side of the equation:\n\\[\ns - 3 + 5s - 3 = 30\n\\]\n\\[\n6s - 6 = 30\n\\]\nNext, add 6 to both sides:\n\\[\n6s - 6 + 6 = 30 + 6\n\\]\n\\[\n6s = 36\n\\]\nNow, divide both sides by 6:\n\\[\ns = 6\n\\]\nThus, the son is currently \\( \\mathbf{6} \\) years old.\nTo verify, let's calculate the father's current age:\nFather's age = \\( 5s = 5 \\times 6 = 30 \\) years.\nNow let's check their ages three years ago:\n- Son: \\( 6 - 3 = 3 \\) years old\n- Father: \\( 30 - 3 = 27 \\) years old\nNow, calculate the sum of their ages three years ago:\n\\[\n3 + 27 = 30\n\\]\nThis confirms that our calculations are correct. Therefore, the son's age today is \\( \\mathbf{6} \\) years old.",
        "Let's denote the son's current age as \\( s \\) and the father's current age as \\( f \\).\nFrom the problem statement, we have the following two equations:\n1. Today, the father's age is five times his son's age:\n   \\[\n   f = 5s\n   \\]\n2. Exactly three years ago, the sum of their ages was 30:\n   \\[\n   (f - 3) + (s - 3) = 30\n   \\]\nWe can simplify the second equation:\n\\[\nf - 3 + s - 3 = 30\n\\]\n\\[\nf + s - 6 = 30\n\\]\n\\[\nf + s = 36\n\\]\nNow we have a system of two equations:\n1. \\( f = 5s \\)\n2. \\( f + s = 36 \\)\nWe can substitute the first equation into the second equation:\n\\[\n5s + s = 36\n\\]\n\\[\n6s = 36\n\\]\nNow, we divide both sides by 6 to solve for \\( s \\):\n\\[\ns = 6\n\\]\nNow that we have the son's current age, we can find the father's age as well using the first equation:\n\\[\nf = 5s = 5 \\times 6 = 30\n\\]\nThus, the son's age today is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{6}\n\\]\nTo confirm our solution, let's check the second condition. Three years ago, the son's age was \\( 6 - 3 = 3 \\) and the father's age was \\( 30 - 3 = 27 \\). The sum of their ages three years ago is:\n\\[\n3 + 27 = 30\n\\]\nThis matches the given condition, so our solution is verified. The son's current age is indeed \\( \\boxed{6} \\).",
        "Let's denote the father's current age as \\( F \\) and the son's current age as \\( S \\).\nAccording to the problem, we have the following pieces of information:\n1.

Exactly three years ago, the sum of their ages was 30:\n   \\[\n   (F - 3) + (S - 3) = 30\n   \\]\nLet's simplify the second equation:\n\\[\nF - 3 + S - 3 = 30 \\\\\nF + S - 6 = 30 \\\\\nF + S = 36\n\\]\nNow, we have two equations:\n1. \\( F = 5S \\)  \n2. \\( F + S = 36 \\)\nWe can substitute the first equation into the second equation:\n\\[\n5S + S = 36\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n6S = 36\n\\]\nDividing both sides by 6 gives:\n\\[\nS = 6\n\\]\nNow that we have the son's age, we can find the father's age by substituting \\( S \\) back into the first equation:\n\\[\nF = 5S = 5 \\times 6 = 30\n\\]\nSo the ages are:\n- Son's age \\( S = 6 \\)\n- Father's age \\( F = 30 \\)\nTo verify, let\u2019s check the conditions:\n1.
