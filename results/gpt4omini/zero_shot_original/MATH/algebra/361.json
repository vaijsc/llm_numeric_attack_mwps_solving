        "To determine how many meals the twelve friends should have ordered for just enough food, we start with the information that:\n- The portions are enough for 18 people, but only 12 friends ordered.\n- Each meal serves a certain number of people.\nLet's denote the number of meals ordered by the friends as \\( M \\).\nSince the meals ordered are sufficient for 18 people, we can reason that:\n- The food from \\( M \\) meals can serve 18 individuals.\nTo find out how many people one meal can serve, we divide the total servings by the number of meals:\n\\[\n\\text{Servings per meal} = \\frac{18 \\text{ servings}}{M}\n\\]\nNow, we want to find out how many meals \\( M' \\) should be ordered to serve exactly 12 people. We set up an equation based on this requirement:\n\\[\nM' \\times \\frac{18}{M} = 12\n\\]\nHere, \\( M' \\) is the number of meals that need to be ordered to serve 12 people. We can solve for \\( M' \\):\n\\[\nM' = 12 \\times \\frac{M}{18}\n\\]\nSimplifying:\n\\[\nM' = \\frac{12M}{18} = \\frac{2M}{3}\n\\]\nNow, substituting the actual number of meals they ordered (which is 12):\n\\[\nM' = \\frac{2 \\times 12}{3} = \\frac{24}{3} = 8\n\\]\nThus, the friends should have ordered **8 meals** to have enough food for the 12 of them.",
        "To figure out how many meals the twelve friends should have ordered, we start by understanding the relationship between the number of meals and the amount of food available.\n1. **Current Meals Ordered**: The twelve friends each ordered one meal, so that results in a total of 12 meals.\n2. **Food Coverage**: The food from these 12 meals is enough for 18 people.\n3. **Finding the Food Ratio**: We can determine how much food is available per meal based on its coverage. Since 12 meals can serve 18 people, we find out how many people one meal can serve:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Food per meal} = \\frac{18 \\text{ people}}{12 \\text{ meals}} = 1.5 \\text{ people per meal}\n   \\]\n4. **Determining Needs for 12 People**: Now, we want to find out how many meals would be needed to serve exactly 12 people. Since each meal serves 1.5 people, we can set up the equation:\n   Let \\( x = \\text{ number of meals needed} \\).\n   The equation based on the serving capacity becomes:\n   \\[\n   1.5 \\cdot x = 12\n   \\]\n5. **Solving for \\( x \\)**:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{12}{1.5} = 8\n   \\]\nThus, the friends should have ordered **8 meals** to have just enough food for all 12 of them.",
        "To determine how many meals the twelve friends should have ordered to have just enough food for all of them, let's break it down step by step.\n1. **Understanding the Portion Sizes**:\n   - The friends' meals were intended for just the twelve of them but the portions were enough for 18 people. This means that each meal they ordered is actually enough to serve 1.5 people (since 18 people can be served with enough food that was ordered for 12).\n2. **Calculate the Total Amount of Food Ordered**:\n   - Since the food was enough for 18 people but it was shared among 12, each meal proportionally serves 1.5 people. The total number of meals ordered (let's denote this as \\(M\\)), is the number of meals that would normally be enough for 12 people.\n3. **Finding the Equivalent Meals for 12 People**:\n   - If one meal can sufficiently feed 1.5 people, then to feed 12 people, we can express this mathematically:\n     \n     \\[\n     \\text{Number of meals needed} = \\frac{12 \\text{ people}}{1.5 \\text{ people per meal}} = 8 \\text{ meals}\n     \\]\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Therefore, to have just enough food for all 12 friends, they should have ordered **8 meals**.\nThus, the answer is that the twelve friends should have ordered **8 meals** to have just enough food.",
        "To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:\n1. **Understand the situation**: We have 12 friends who each ordered one meal, and there is enough food for 18 people. \n2. **Calculate the total food**: Since there are enough portions for 18 people, we can consider this as having 18 \"meals' worth\" of food.\n3. **Determine the shareability**: If the food is shared, then the 12 friends can share the food that originally intended to feed 18. \n4. **Calculate meals needed for 12**: We want to find out how many meals they should have ordered so that the total food is just enough for 12 people.\n5. **Formula derivation**: If we denote the number of meals needed (x), the total food provided by those meals should equal the food they have now, which is enough for 18.\n   If 1 meal feeds 1 person (meant for 18 people), then to find how many meals (x) are needed to feed 12 people, we can set up a proportion:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total meals (for 18)} = x \n   \\text{ meals (for 12)}\n   \\]\n   Using the ratio:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{x}{18} = \\frac{12}{x} \\Rightarrow\n   x = \\frac{12 \\cdot 18}{x}\n   \\]\n   However, since they ordered more than needed, we can simplify it differently.\n6. **Simpler method**: Since they have food for 18:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Food each person gets} = \\frac{18}{12} = 1.5 \\quad (\\text{indicating each of the 12 friends can consume 1.5 portions})\n   \\]\n   Thus, if they needed to have just enough food:\n   A meal intended to serve 1 would mean \\( \\frac{12}{1} = 12 \\) meals. \n   But since each meal serves enough for 1.5 people when total food is for 18 people, thus the friends would need to order fewer meals for 12 people:\n   \\[\n   12 \\text{ people} - \\text{each getting an equal share of } \\frac{18 \\text{ portions}}{12 \\text{ friends}} = 1.5 Morally, to get the exact share:\n   \\]\n   So, to calculate how many meals they should have ordered:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{12 \\text{ people} } {1 \\text{ meal serving}} = 12 \\text{ total tidbits to equal}\n   \\]\n   If they would just need enough for precisely 12, they should only need 8 meals.\n7. **Final answer**: \n   To feed exactly 12 people, they should have ordered:\n   \\[\n    \\boxed{8} \\text{ meals}\n   \\]\nThus, having ordered 8 meals would give just enough for each friend without any excess food.",
        "To determine how many meals should have been ordered to have just enough food for the 12 friends, we start with the information given:\n1. **Number of Friends**: 12\n2. **Food Portions Available**: Enough food for 18 people.\nSince the 12 friends ended up with enough food for 18 people, we can find out how many meals each individual meal is capable of serving in terms of people.\n### Step 1: Calculate the Portion Per Meal\nThe ratio of food servings (based on the number of people the food can serve) gives us insight into how many people each meal could serve. \n- Total servings available = 18 servings\n- Total meals ordered = 12 (one meal each for the 12 friends)\nNow, we calculate the number of servings that each meal provides:\n\\[\n\\text{Servings per Meal} = \\frac{\\text{Total Servings}}{\\text{Total Meals Ordered}} = \\frac{18}{12} = 1.5\n\\]\nThis means that each meal can feed 1.5 people.\n### Step 2: Calculate How Many Meals are Needed for 12 Friends\nNow, we need to find out how many meals would be necessary to serve 12 people assuming each meal serves 1.5 people:\n\\[\n\\text{Meals Needed} = \\frac{\\text{Total Friends}}{\\text{Servings per Meal}} = \\frac{12}{1.5}\n\\]\nCalculating that:\n\\[\n\\text{Meals Needed} = 8\n\\]\n### Conclusion\nTo have just enough food for the 12 friends, they should have ordered **8 meals**."
