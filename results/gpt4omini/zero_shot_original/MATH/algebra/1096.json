        "To find the value of an 8-foot stack of nickels, we will follow these steps:\n1. **Convert feet to inches**: Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, an 8-foot stack equals:\n   \\[\n   8 \\text{ feet} \\times 12 \\text{ inches/foot} = 96 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n2. **Determine the height of one nickel**: We know that 100 nickels stack to a height of 6.25 inches. Therefore, the height of one nickel can be calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Height of one nickel} = \\frac{6.25 \\text{ inches}}{100} = 0.0625 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n3. **Calculate the number of nickels in an 8-foot stack**: To find the number of nickels in a 96-inch stack, we divide the total height by the height of one nickel:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of nickels} = \\frac{96 \\text{ inches}}{0.0625 \\text{ inches/nickel}} = 96 \\div 0.0625 = 1536\n   \\]\n4. **Determine the value of the nickels**: Each nickel is worth $0.05. The total value can thus be calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total value} = \\text{Number of nickels} \\times 0.05 \\text{ dollars/nickel}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total value} = 1536 \\times 0.05 = 76.8 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n5. **Round to the nearest hundredth**: The value is already at two decimal places, which is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total value} = 76.80 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\nTherefore, the value of an 8-foot stack of nickels is **76.80 dollars**.",
        "To find the value of an 8-foot stack of nickels, we can follow these steps:\n1. **Determine the height of 8 feet in inches:**\n   \\[\n   8 \\text{ feet} = 8 \\times 12 \\text{ inches/foot} = 96 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n2. **Calculate how many nickel stacks fit into an 8-foot stack:**\n   We know that a stack of 100 nickels has a height of 6.25 inches. To find out how many such stacks fit into a height of 96 inches, we perform the following calculation:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of stacks} = \\frac{96 \\text{ inches}}{6.25 \\text{ inches/stack}} = \\frac{96}{6.25} = 15.36\n   \\]\n   Since we can only have whole stacks, we take the integer part:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of stacks} = 15\n   \\]\n3. **Calculate the total number of nickels in these stacks:**\n   Since each stack contains 100 nickels, the total number of nickels is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total nickels} = 15 \\text{ stacks} \\times 100 \\text{ nickels/stack} = 1500 \\text{ nickels}\n   \\]\n4. **Determine the value of the total number of nickels:**\n   Each nickel is worth $0.05, so the total value in dollars is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Value} = 1500 \\text{ nickels} \\times 0.05 \\text{ dollars/nickel} = 75 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n5. **Final answer:**\n   The value of an 8-foot stack of nickels is:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{75.00} \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]",
