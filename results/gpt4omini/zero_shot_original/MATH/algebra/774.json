    "solution": "Given that we have $- 35 - x + 12x^2$ and the factor $3x + 5$, we can guess that the other factor must be $4x - 7$ since the linear terms must multiply to $12x^2$ and the constant terms must multiply to $-35.$\n\nExpanding, we can verify that this is correct, and therefore our answer is $\\boxed{(4x - 7)}.$",

        "To factor the quadratic expression \\(-35 - x + 12x^2\\), we first reorder the terms:\n\\[\n12x^2 - x - 35\n\\]\nNext, we write this as:\n\\[\n12x^2 - x - 35 = (3x + 5)(Ax + B)\n\\]\nwhere \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are constants to be determined.

        "To factor the expression \\(-35 - x + 12x^2\\) completely, let's first rewrite it in standard form. The standard form of a quadratic expression is typically written as \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\).
