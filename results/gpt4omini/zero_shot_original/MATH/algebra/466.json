    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We first find that $2$ five-pound cakes results in $2 \\times 5 = 10$ pounds of cake total. Since a two-pound cake requires $1.5$ cups of flour, a ten pounds of cake will require five times as much flour (since $10/2=5$). Five times $1.5$ cups of flour is $\\boxed{7.5}$ pounds of flour.",

        "To determine how many cups of flour are needed for 2 five-pound cakes, we can follow these steps:\n1. **Determine the flour needed per pound of cake**:\n   - The recipe states that a two-pound cake requires 1.5 cups of flour.\n   - To find the amount of flour required per pound, we can divide the amount of flour by the weight of the cake:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Flour per pound} = \\frac{1.5 \\text{ cups}}{2 \\text{ pounds}} = 0.75 \\text{ cups per pound}\n     \\]\n2. **Calculate the flour needed for one five-pound cake**:\n   - Now that we know the amount of flour needed per pound (0.75 cups), we can multiply this by the weight of one five-pound cake:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Flour for one five-pound cake} = 0.75 \\text{ cups/pound} \\times 5 \\text{ pounds} = 3.75 \\text{ cups}\n     \\]\n3. **Calculate the total flour needed for two five-pound cakes**:\n   - Since we want to make two five-pound cakes, we multiply the flour needed for one by 2:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total flour for two five-pound cakes} = 3.75 \\text{ cups} \\times 2 = 7.5 \\text{ cups}\n     \\]\nSo, for 2 five-pound cakes, a total of **7.5 cups of flour** is needed.",
        "To determine how many cups of flour are needed for 2 five-pound cakes, we can follow these steps:\n1. **Identify the ratio of the cake sizes**:\n   - A two-pound cake requires 1.5 cups of flour.\n   - We need to know how much flour is needed for a five-pound cake.\n2. **Calculate the flour needed for one five-pound cake**:\n   - Since 5 pounds is 2.5 times the weight of a 2-pound cake (5 / 2 = 2.5), we can multiply the amount of flour for a 2-pound cake by this factor.\n   - Flour needed for one five-pound cake:\n     \\[\n     1.5 \\text{ cups} \\times 2.5 = 3.75 \\text{ cups}\n     \\]\n3. **Calculate the flour needed for two five-pound cakes**:\n   - To find out how much flour is needed for 2 five-pound cakes:\n     \\[\n     3.75 \\text{ cups} \\times 2 = 7.5 \\text{ cups}\n     \\]\nTherefore, the total amount of flour needed for 2 five-pound cakes is **7.5 cups**.",
        "To determine how many cups of flour are needed for 2 five-pound cakes based on the recipe for a two-pound cake, we can follow these steps:\n1. **Identify the amount of flour for the two-pound cake**: \n   - The recipe specifies 1.5 cups of flour for a two-pound cake.\n2. **Calculate the amount of flour needed per pound**:\n   - Since the two-pound cake requires 1.5 cups of flour, we can find the amount needed per pound by dividing the total amount of flour by the weight of the cake.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Flour per pound} = \\frac{1.5 \\, \\text{cups}}{2 \\, \\text{pounds}} = 0.75 \\, \\text{cups per pound}\n   \\]\n3. **Calculate the total amount of flour needed for one five-pound cake**:\n   - Now that we know there are 0.75 cups of flour per pound, we can calculate the amount needed for a five-pound cake.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Flour for one five-pound cake} = 0.75 \\, \\text{cups per pound} \\times 5 \\, \\text{pounds} = 3.75 \\, \\text{cups}\n   \\]\n4. **Calculate the total amount of flour needed for two five-pound cakes**:\n   - Finally, to find out how much flour is needed for two five-pound cakes, we multiply the amount for one five-pound cake by 2.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Flour for two five-pound cakes} = 3.75 \\, \\text{cups} \\times 2 = 7.5 \\, \\text{cups}\n   \\]\nTherefore, for 2 five-pound cakes, we will need **7.5 cups of flour**.",
