        "To find the smallest number \\( y \\) such that \\( y^2 = 81 \\), we can start by taking the square root of 81.\n1. **Calculate the square root of 81**: \n   \\[\n   y = \\sqrt{81}\n   \\]\n2. **Find the value**: \n   We know that \\( 9 \\times 9 = 81 \\), so:\n   \\[\n   y = 9\n   \\]\n3. **Consider negative roots**: \n   Since \\( y^2 = 81 \\) can have two solutions (positive and negative), we also find:\n   \\[\n   y = -9\n   \\]\n4. **Identify the smallest solution**: \n   Out of the two possible values \\( 9 \\) and \\( -9 \\), the smallest number is:\n   \\[\n   y = -9\n   \\]\nTherefore, the smallest number \\( y \\) such that \\( y^2 = 81 \\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{-9}\n\\]",
        "To find the smallest number \\( y \\) such that \\( y^2 = 81 \\), we can start by solving the equation.\n1. Recognize that the equation \\( y^2 = 81 \\) can be solved by taking the square root of both sides.\n2. The square root of 81 is calculated as follows:\n   \\[\n   y = \\sqrt{81}\n   \\]\n3. We know that:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{81} = 9\n   \\]\n4. However, since squaring a negative number also results in a positive output, we also consider the negative square root:\n   \\[\n   y = -\\sqrt{81} = -9\n   \\]\nAt this point, we have two solutions to the equation \\( y^2 = 81 \\): \\( y = 9 \\) and \\( y = -9 \\).\n5. Since the problem asks for the smallest number \\( y \\), we compare \\( 9 \\) and \\( -9 \\).\n6. Clearly, \\( -9 \\) is smaller than \\( 9 \\).\nThus, the smallest number \\( y \\) such that \\( y^2 = 81 \\) is \n\\[\n\\boxed{-9}\n\\]",
        "To find the smallest number \\( y \\) such that \\( y^2 = 81 \\), we start by taking the square root of both sides of the equation.\n1.

Now, we calculate the square root:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{81} = 9\n   \\]\n4. Additionally, we should consider that squaring a negative number can also yield the same result:\n   \\[\n   y = -\\sqrt{81} = -9\n   \\]\n5.
