        "To express the quadratic \\( x^2 - 6x + 66 \\) in the form \\( (x+b)^2 + c \\), we will complete the square.\n1. Start with the quadratic:\n   \\[\n   x^2 - 6x + 66\n   \\]\n2. To complete the square for the quadratic expression, focus on the \\( x^2 - 6x \\) part. To complete the square, find the value that needs to be added and subtracted. This value can be found by taking the coefficient of \\( x \\), which is \\(-6\\), halving it, and then squaring it:\n   \\[\n   \\left(-\\frac{6}{2}\\right)^2 = (-3)^2 = 9\n   \\]\n3. Now, we rewrite the expression by adding and subtracting 9:\n   \\[\n   x^2 - 6x + 9 - 9 + 66\n   \\]\n4. This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   (x - 3)^2 - 9 + 66\n   \\]\n   Combining the constants:\n   \\[\n   (x - 3)^2 + 57\n   \\]\n5. Now, we have the expression in the form \\( (x+b)^2 + c \\), where \\( b = -3 \\) and \\( c = 57 \\).\n6. Finally, we need to find \\( b + c \\):\n   \\[\n   b + c = -3 + 57 = 54\n   \\]\nThus, the value of \\( b + c \\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{54}\n\\]",
        "To rewrite the quadratic expression \\( x^2 - 6x + 66 \\) in the form \\( (x+b)^2 + c \\), we will complete the square.\n1. Start with the original expression:\n   \\[\n   x^2 - 6x + 66\n   \\]\n2. To complete the square, we focus on the \\( x^2 - 6x \\) part. We need to find a value to add and subtract to form a perfect square:\n   - Take half of the coefficient of \\( x \\), which is \\(-6\\):\n     \\[\n     \\frac{-6}{2} = -3\n     \\]\n   - Square this result:\n     \\[\n     (-3)^2 = 9\n     \\]\n3. Add and subtract this squared value \\( 9 \\) inside the expression:\n   \\[\n   x^2 - 6x + 9 - 9 + 66\n   \\]\n4. Now, regroup the terms:\n   \\[\n   (x^2 - 6x + 9) + (66 - 9)\n   \\]\n5. Simplify the expression:\n   - The term \\( x^2 - 6x + 9 \\) can be factored as \\( (x - 3)^2 \\).\n   - The constant part simplifies as follows:\n     \\[\n     66 - 9 = 57\n     \\]\n   Thus, we have:\n   \\[\n   (x - 3)^2 + 57\n   \\]\n6.
