    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Monica's shadow is $\\dfrac{2}{5}$ times as long as she is tall, so the pine tree's shadow is also $\\dfrac{2}{5}$ times as long as the tree is tall. Since the pine tree's shadow is 34 feet long, the pine tree itself is $34\\div \\dfrac{2}{5}=(34)\\left(\\dfrac{5}{2}\\right)=\\boxed{85\\text{ feet}}$ tall.",

        "To find the height of the pine tree, we can use the concept of similar triangles. The ratio of the height of an object to the length of its shadow will be the same for both Monica and the pine tree.\n1. **Identify the known quantities**:\n   - Height of Monica: 5 feet\n   - Length of Monica's shadow: 2 feet\n   - Length of the pine tree's shadow: 34 feet\n   - Let \\( h \\) be the height of the pine tree (in feet).\n2. **Set up the ratio**:\n   The ratio of Monica's height to her shadow length is the same as the ratio of the pine tree's height to its shadow length:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\text{Height of Monica}}{\\text{Length of Monica's shadow}} = \\frac{\\text{Height of pine tree}}{\\text{Length of pine tree's shadow}}\n   \\]\n   Plugging in the known values gives:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{5 \\text{ ft}}{2 \\text{ ft}} = \\frac{h}{34 \\text{ ft}}\n   \\]\n3. **Cross-multiply to solve for \\( h \\)**:\n   \\[\n   5 \\text{ ft} \\times 34 \\text{ ft} = 2 \\text{ ft} \\times h\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   170 \\text{ ft}^2 = 2h\n   \\]\n4. **Divide both sides by 2 to isolate \\( h \\)**:\n   \\[\n   h = \\frac{170 \\text{ ft}^2}{2} = 85 \\text{ ft}\n   \\]\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   The height of the pine tree is \\( h = 85 \\) feet.",
        "To find the height of the pine tree, we can use the concept of similar triangles. Since the sun casts shadows at the same angle for both the pine tree and Monica, the ratios of their heights to their shadow lengths will be equal.\n1. We know the following:\n   - Monica's height = 5 feet\n   - Monica's shadow length = 2 feet\n   - Pine tree's shadow length = 34 feet\n   - Pine tree's height = ? (let's denote it as \\( h_t \\))\n2. We can set up the ratio using the heights and shadow lengths:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\text{Monica's height}}{\\text{Monica's shadow}} = \\frac{\\text{Pine tree's height}}{\\text{Pine tree's shadow}}\n   \\]\n3. Substituting in the known values:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{5}{2} = \\frac{h_t}{34}\n   \\]\n4. Cross-multiplying to solve for \\( h_t \\):\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 34 = 2 \\times h_t\n   \\]\n5. This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   170 = 2h_t\n   \\]\n6. Now, divide both sides by 2 to isolate \\( h_t \\):\n   \\[\n   h_t = \\frac{170}{2} = 85\n   \\]\n7. Therefore, the height of the pine tree is \\( \\boxed{85} \\) feet.",
        "To find the height of the pine tree, we can set up a proportion based on the heights and the lengths of the shadows.\n1. **Identify the known values**:\n   - Monica's height = 5 feet\n   - Monica's shadow length = 2 feet\n   - Pine tree's shadow length = 34 feet\n   - Pine tree's height = ? (Let's call this height \\( h \\))\n2. **Set up the proportion**:\n   We can use the fact that the ratios of height to shadow length are the same for both Monica and the pine tree. This gives us the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\text{Monica's height}}{\\text{Monica's shadow}} = \\frac{\\text{Pine tree's height}}{\\text{Pine tree's shadow}}\n   \\]\n   Plugging in the known values:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{5}{2} = \\frac{h}{34}\n   \\]\n3. **Cross-multiply to solve for \\( h \\)**:\n   Cross-multiplying gives us:\n   \\[\n   5 \\cdot 34 = 2 \\cdot h\n   \\]\n   Calculating that out:\n   \\[\n   170 = 2h\n   \\]\n4. **Isolate \\( h \\)**:\n   To find \\( h \\), divide both sides by 2:\n   \\[\n   h = \\frac{170}{2} = 85\n   \\]\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   The height of the pine tree is \\( \\boxed{85} \\) feet.",
