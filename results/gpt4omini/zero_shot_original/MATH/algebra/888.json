    "solution": "Vertical asymptotes occur at values of $x$ where the denominator is 0.  We can factor the denominator into $(x-7)(x+2)$, so the denominator equals 0 when $x=7$ or $x=-2$. Those $x$-values are where our vertical asymptotes are located.\n\nFor horizontal asymptotes, we look at the degree of $x$ in the numerator and the denominator. The degree of the numerator is 1, and the degree of the denominator is 2, so the denominator grows faster than the numerator for large values of $x$, and the function approaches the horizontal asymptote $y=0$. We can also see that when we divide $x$ out of the numerator and denominator, we get \\[\\frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} = \\frac{\\frac{2x}{x}}{\\frac{x^2-5x-14}{x}}=\\frac{2}{x-5-\\frac{14}{x}}.\\]As $x$ approaches infinity or negative infinity, the expression approaches 0.\n\nSo, our answer is $7 + (-2) + 0 = \\boxed{5}$.",

We start by setting the denominator equal to zero:\n\\[\nx^2 - 5x - 14 = 0\n\\]\nNext, we factor the quadratic:\n\\[\nx^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2) = 0\n\\]\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives us:\n\\[\nx - 7 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = 7\n\\]\n\\[\nx + 2 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = -2\n\\]\nThus, the vertical asymptotes are at \\( x = 7 \\) and \\( x = -2 \\). Therefore, we have:\n\\[\na = 7, \\quad b = -2\n\\]\n### Step 2: Finding the Horizontal Asymptote\nThe horizontal asymptote is determined by analyzing the behavior of the function as \\( x \\) approaches infinity. We look at the degrees of the polynomial in the numerator and the denominator.\n- The degree of the numerator \\( 2x \\) is 1.\n- The degree of the denominator \\( x^2 - 5x - 14 \\) is 2.\nSince the degree of the denominator (2) is greater than that of the numerator (1), the horizontal asymptote is given by the equation:\n\\[\ny = 0\n\\]\nThis means:\n\\[\nc = 0\n\\]\n### Step 3: Summing Up\nNow we find \\( a + b + c \\):\n\\[\na + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5\n\\]\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]",
