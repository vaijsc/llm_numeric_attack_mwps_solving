        "To solve for \\(N\\) in the expression \\((2^3)^{(2^3)} = 2^N\\), we will simplify the left-hand side step by step.\n1. Start with the expression:\n   \\[\n   (2^3)^{(2^3)}\n   \\]\n2. Apply the power of a power property, which states \\( (a^m)^n = a^{m \\cdot n} \\):\n   \\[\n   (2^3)^{(2^3)} = 2^{3 \\cdot (2^3)}\n   \\]\n3. Calculate \\(2^3\\):\n   \\[\n   2^3 = 8\n   \\]\n4. Substitute \\(8\\) back into the expression:\n   \\[\n   3 \\cdot (2^3) = 3 \\cdot 8 = 24\n   \\]\n5. Now we can rewrite the expression:\n   \\[\n   (2^3)^{(2^3)} = 2^{24}\n   \\]\n6. Since we have \\((2^3)^{(2^3)} = 2^N\\), we can equate the exponents:\n   \\[\n   N = 24\n   \\]\nTherefore, the value of \\(N\\) is \\(\\boxed{24}\\).",
        "To solve the expression \\((2^3)^{(2^3)}\\) in the form of \\(2^N\\), we will begin by simplifying the left-hand side.\n1. First, we compute \\(2^3\\):\n   \\[\n   2^3 = 8.\n   \\]\n   Thus, we can rewrite our expression:\n   \\[\n   (2^3)^{(2^3)} = 8^{(2^3)}.\n   \\]\n2. Next, we simplify \\(2^3\\) again, as we need to use this value in our exponent:\n   \\[\n   2^3 = 8.\n   \\]\n   Therefore, now our expression becomes:\n   \\[\n   8^{8}.\n   \\]\n3. We can express 8 as a power of 2:\n   \\[\n   8 = 2^3.\n   \\]\n   Hence, we rewrite \\(8^8\\) using this new representation:\n   \\[\n   8^8 = (2^3)^8.\n   \\]\n4. Now, we use the property of exponents where \\((a^m)^n = a^{m \\cdot n}\\):\n   \\[\n   (2^3)^8 = 2^{3 \\cdot 8} = 2^{24}.\n   \\]\n5. Now that we have simplified the left-hand side to the form \\(2^N\\), we can equate it:\n   \\[\n   2^{24} = 2^N.\n   \\]\n6. This implies that:\n   \\[\n   N = 24.\n   \\]\nThus, the value of \\(N\\) is \\(\\boxed{24}\\).",
        "We start with the given expression: \n\\[\n(2^3)^{(2^3)}\n\\]\nFirst, we apply the property of exponents that states \\((a^m)^n = a^{m \\cdot n}\\). In our case, we have:\n\\[\n(2^3)^{(2^3)} = 2^{3 \\cdot (2^3)}\n\\]\nNext, we need to calculate \\(3 \\cdot (2^3)\\). We know that \\(2^3 = 8\\), so we can substitute this value in:\n\\[\n3 \\cdot (2^3) = 3 \\cdot 8 = 24\n\\]\nThis means that our expression simplifies to:\n\\[\n(2^3)^{(2^3)} = 2^{24}\n\\]\nAccording to the problem, this expression is equal to \\(2^N\\). Therefore, we can write:\n\\[\n2^{24} = 2^N\n\\]\nSince the bases are the same, we can equate the exponents:\n\\[\nN = 24\n\\]\nThus, the value of \\(N\\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{24}\n\\]",
        "To solve for \\( N \\) in the equation \\( (2^3)^{(2^3)} = 2^N \\), we will use the properties of exponents.\nFirst, we simplify the left side of the equation:\n1.

Now substituting this back into our expression gives us:\n   \\[\n   (2^3)^{(2^3)} = 2^{24}\n   \\]\n4. Now we can equate this to the right side of the equation:\n   \\[\n   2^{24} = 2^N\n   \\]\n5.
