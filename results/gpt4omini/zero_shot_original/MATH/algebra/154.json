        "To find the value of \\(\\frac{z}{y}\\) given that \\(\\frac{x}{y}= 2\\) and \\(\\frac{z}{x}= 4\\), we will manipulate these equations step by step.\n1. Start from the first equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{x}{y} = 2\n   \\]\n   From this, we can express \\(x\\) in terms of \\(y\\):\n   \\[\n   x = 2y\n   \\]\n2. Now, use the second equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{z}{x} = 4\n   \\]\n   From this equation, we can express \\(z\\) in terms of \\(x\\):\n   \\[\n   z = 4x\n   \\]\n3. Now substitute the expression for \\(x\\) from step 1 into the equation for \\(z\\):\n   \\[\n   z = 4(2y) = 8y\n   \\]\n4. Now we want to find \\(\\frac{z}{y}\\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{z}{y} = \\frac{8y}{y}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying gives:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{z}{y} = 8\n   \\]\nThus, the value of \\(\\frac{z}{y}\\) is \\(\\boxed{8}\\).",
        "To find the value of \\(\\frac{z}{y}\\), we can start from the given ratios.\n1. From the equation \\(\\frac{x}{y} = 2\\), we can express \\(x\\) in terms of \\(y\\):\n   \\[\n   x = 2y\n   \\]\n2. Next, we have the equation \\(\\frac{z}{x} = 4\\), which allows us to express \\(z\\) in terms of \\(x\\):\n   \\[\n   z = 4x\n   \\]\n3. Now, we can substitute \\(x\\) from the first equation into the second equation:\n   \\[\n   z = 4(2y) = 8y\n   \\]\n4. Finally, we can find \\(\\frac{z}{y}\\) by substituting \\(z = 8y\\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{z}{y} = \\frac{8y}{y} = 8\n   \\]\nThus, the value of \\(\\frac{z}{y}\\) is \\(\\boxed{8}\\).",
