    "solution": "Let $a$ be the smaller of the two numbers and let $b$ be the larger of the two. Then $\\dfrac{a}{b}=\\dfrac{3}{5}$, so $5a=3b$. Additionally, $\\dfrac{a-4}{b+8}=\\dfrac{2}{7}$, so cross multiplying gives $7(a-4)=2(b+8)$. We now have a system of two linear equations; solving gives $a=12$, $b=20$. Since the question asks us for the value of $b$, our answer is $\\boxed{20}$.",

        "Let the two numbers be represented as \\(3x\\) and \\(5x\\), where \\(3x\\) is the lesser number and \\(5x\\) is the greater number due to the ratio \\(3:5\\).\nAccording to the problem, when 4 is subtracted from the lesser number and 8 is added to the greater number, the new ratio becomes \\(2:7\\). Therefore, we can express this situation mathematically:\n\\[\n\\frac{3x - 4}{5x + 8} = \\frac{2}{7}\n\\]\nTo eliminate the fraction, we can cross-multiply:\n\\[\n7(3x - 4) = 2(5x + 8)\n\\]\nExpanding both sides gives:\n\\[\n21x - 28 = 10x + 16\n\\]\nNext, we isolate \\(x\\) by moving all terms involving \\(x\\) to one side and constant terms to the other:\n\\[\n21x - 10x = 16 + 28\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n11x = 44\n\\]\nBy dividing both sides by 11, we find:\n\\[\nx = 4\n\\]\nNow, we substitute \\(x\\) back into the expressions for the two original numbers:\n- The lesser number is:\n\\[\n3x = 3 \\cdot 4 = 12\n\\]\n- The greater number is:\n\\[\n5x = 5 \\cdot 4 = 20\n\\]\nFinally, the problem asks for the greater of the two numbers before adding 8 to it.
