    "problem": "Angie decided to use her class as a sample to predict the total number of students in her school wearing red on Valentine's Day. She counted 11 students wearing red in her class of 24 students. Using this ratio, how many of the 480 students in her school will she estimate are wearing red?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We can use the given information to set up a ratio and solve for the number of kids in the school that are wearing red.  Let $x$ equal the total number of students wearing red in the school.  From the given information, we have$$\\frac{11}{24}=\\frac{x}{480},$$so  $$x=\\frac{480\\cdot 11}{24},$$which means $$x=20\\cdot 11=\\boxed{220}.$$",

        "To estimate the number of students in the school wearing red based on Angie's class sample, we can follow these steps:\n1. **Identify the ratio of students wearing red in the class:**\n   - Angie counted 11 students wearing red in a class of 24 students.\n   - The ratio of students wearing red in her class can be expressed as:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{11}{24}\n     \\]\n2. **Determine the total number of students in the school:**\n   - The total number of students in her school is 480.\n3. **Calculate the estimated number of students in the school wearing red:**\n   - We can use the ratio found in the class to estimate the number of students wearing red in the entire school.\n   - To find this, we can set up the equation based on the proportion:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Estimated number of students wearing red} = \\left(\\frac{11}{24}\\right) \\times 480\n     \\]\n4. **Perform the calculation:**\n   - First, calculate \\(\\frac{11}{24} \\times 480\\):\n     \\[\n     \\frac{11 \\times 480}{24}\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying this:\n     \\[\n     11 \\times 20 = 220\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the estimated number of students wearing red is:\n     \\[\n     220\n     \\]\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   Angie's estimate indicates that approximately **220 students** in her school are wearing red on Valentine's Day.",
        "To estimate how many students in the school are wearing red based on Angie's class, we can use the ratio of students wearing red in her class and apply it to the total number of students in the school. Let's go through the steps:\n1. **Determine the ratio of students wearing red in Angie's class**:\n   - Number of students wearing red = 11\n   - Total number of students in the class = 24\n   - Ratio of students wearing red = Number of students wearing red / Total number of students\n     \\[\n     \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{11}{24}\n     \\]\n2. **Use this ratio to predict the number of students wearing red in the school**:\n   - Total number of students in the school = 480\n   - Estimated number of students wearing red in the school = Ratio x Total number of students in the school\n     \\[\n     \\text{Estimated number wearing red} = \\frac{11}{24} \\times 480\n     \\]\n3. **Calculate the estimated number of students wearing red**:\n   - First, calculate \\( \\frac{480}{24} \\):\n     \\[\n     \\frac{480}{24} = 20\n     \\]\n   - Now, multiply this result by 11:\n     \\[\n     20 \\times 11 = 220\n     \\]\nThus, Angie estimates that **220 students** in her school will be wearing red on Valentine's Day.",
        "To predict the total number of students in Angie\u2019s school who are wearing red on Valentine's Day based on her class sample, we can follow these steps:\n1. **Calculate the ratio of students wearing red in Angie's class:**\n   - Angie counted 11 students wearing red out of 24 students in her class.\n   - The ratio of students wearing red is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{11}{24}\n     \\]\n2. **Determine the total number of students in the school:**\n   - The total number of students in the school is given as 480.\n3. **Use the ratio to predict the number of students wearing red in the school:**\n   - We will use the ratio of students wearing red from Angie's class to estimate the number of students wearing red in the entire school.
