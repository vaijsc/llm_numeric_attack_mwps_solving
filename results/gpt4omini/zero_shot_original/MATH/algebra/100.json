        "We start with the equation \n\\[\n{(3^k)}^6 = 3^6.\n\\]\nTo simplify the left-hand side, we can use the property of exponents that states \\((a^m)^n = a^{m \\cdot n}\\). Applying this property gives us:\n\\[\n(3^k)^6 = 3^{k \\cdot 6}.\n\\]\nNow, we can rewrite our equation as:\n\\[\n3^{k \\cdot 6} = 3^6.\n\\]\nSince the bases on both sides of the equation are the same (base 3), we can set the exponents equal to each other:\n\\[\nk \\cdot 6 = 6.\n\\]\nTo solve for \\(k\\), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:\n\\[\nk = \\frac{6}{6} = 1.\n\\]\nThus, the value of \\(k\\) is \n\\[\n\\boxed{1}.\n\\]",
