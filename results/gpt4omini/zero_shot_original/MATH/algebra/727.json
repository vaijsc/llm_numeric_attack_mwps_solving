        "To find the difference between the sum of the first 2003 even counting numbers and the sum of the first 2003 odd counting numbers, we will first calculate each sum separately and then find the difference.\n**1. Sum of the first 2003 even counting numbers:**\nEven counting numbers can be represented as:\n\\[ 2, 4, 6, 8, \\ldots, 2n \\]\nFor the first \\( n \\) even numbers, the \\( n \\)-th even number is \\( 2n \\). Therefore, the first 2003 even counting numbers are:\n\\[ 2, 4, 6, \\ldots, 2 \\times 2003 = 4006 \\]\nThe sum of the first \\( n \\) even numbers is given by the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of first n even numbers} = n(n + 1)\n\\]\nFor \\( n = 2003 \\):\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of first 2003 even numbers} = 2003 \\times (2003 + 1) = 2003 \\times 2004\n\\]\nNow, let's compute \\( 2003 \\times 2004 \\):\n\\[\n2003 \\times 2004 = 2003 \\times (2000 + 4) = 2003 \\times 2000 + 2003 \\times 4 = 4006000 + 8012 = 4004012\n\\]\n**2. Sum of the first 2003 odd counting numbers:**\nOdd counting numbers can be represented as:\n\\[ 1, 3, 5, 7, \\ldots, 2n - 1 \\]\nFor the first \\( n \\) odd numbers, the \\( n \\)-th odd number is \\( 2n - 1 \\). Thus, the first 2003 odd counting numbers are:\n\\[ 1, 3, 5, \\ldots, 2 \\times 2003 - 1 = 4005 \\]\nThe sum of the first \\( n \\) odd numbers is given by the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of first n odd numbers} = n^2\n\\]\nFor \\( n = 2003 \\):\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of first 2003 odd numbers} = 2003^2\n\\]\nNow, let's compute \\( 2003^2 \\):\n\\[\n2003^2 = (2000 + 3)^2 = 2000^2 + 2 \\times 2000 \\times 3 + 3^2 = 4000000 + 12000 + 9 = 4012009\n\\]\n**3. Calculating the difference:**\nNow we need to find the difference between the sum of the first 2003 even counting numbers and the sum of the first 2003 odd counting numbers:\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = \\text{Sum of first 2003 even numbers} - \\text{Sum of first 2003 odd numbers}\n\\]\nSubstituting the values we have calculated:\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = 4004012 - 4012009\n\\]\nCalculating the difference:\n\\[\n4004012 - 4012009 = -7997\n\\]\nThus, the difference between the sum of the first 2003 even counting numbers and the sum of the first 2003 odd counting numbers is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{-7997}\n\\]",
