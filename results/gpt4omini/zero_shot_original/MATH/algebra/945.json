    "problem": "Jasmine drank 1.5 pints of water on the first 3 miles of her hike. If she continued at this rate, how many pints of water would she drink in the next 10 miles?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We can set up the ratios $\\frac{1.5}{3}=\\frac{x}{10}$, where $x$ is how many pints of water she'd drink in the next 10 miles. We cross-multiply to get $3x=1.5(10)=15$, which means $x=5$. Jasmine would drink $\\boxed{5}$ pints of water in the next 10 miles.",

        "To find out how many pints of water Jasmine would drink in the next 10 miles, we first need to determine how much water she drinks per mile.\n1. **Calculate the water consumption per mile:**\n   Jasmine drank 1.5 pints of water over the first 3 miles. To find out how much she drinks per mile, we divide the total water consumed by the number of miles:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Water per mile} = \\frac{1.5 \\text{ pints}}{3 \\text{ miles}} = 0.5 \\text{ pints/mile}\n   \\]\n2. **Calculate the total water for the next 10 miles:**\n   Now that we know Jasmine drinks 0.5 pints of water per mile, we can calculate how much she would drink in the next 10 miles:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total water for 10 miles} = 0.5 \\text{ pints/mile} \\times 10 \\text{ miles} = 5 \\text{ pints}\n   \\]\nTherefore, Jasmine would drink **5 pints** of water in the next 10 miles.",

        "To determine how many pints of water Jasmine would drink during the next 10 miles of her hike, we first need to establish her rate of water consumption per mile. \n1. **Find the rate of water consumption per mile**:\n   - Jasmine drank 1.5 pints for the first 3 miles.\n   - To find the rate per mile, we divide the total amount of water consumed by the number of miles:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Rate per mile} = \\frac{1.5 \\text{ pints}}{3 \\text{ miles}} = 0.5 \\text{ pints per mile}\n     \\]\n2. **Calculate the amount of water for the next 10 miles**:\n   - Since she drinks 0.5 pints each mile, we multiply this rate by the number of new miles (10 miles):\n     \\[\n     \\text{Water for 10 miles} = 0.5 \\text{ pints/mile} \\times 10 \\text{ miles} = 5 \\text{ pints}\n     \\]\nTherefore, Jasmine would drink **5 pints of water** in the next 10 miles of her hike.",
