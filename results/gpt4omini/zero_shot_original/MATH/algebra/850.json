        "To determine how many vertical asymptotes the graph of the function \\( y = \\frac{x-3}{x^2 + 7x - 30} \\) has, we need to find the points where the function is undefined. This happens when the denominator is equal to zero, provided that the numerator does not also equal zero at those points.\nWe start by finding the roots of the denominator:\n\\[ x^2 + 7x - 30 = 0. \\]\nWe can factor this quadratic equation. We are looking for two numbers that multiply to \\(-30\\) and add to \\(7\\). These numbers are \\(10\\) and \\(-3\\). Thus, we factor the quadratic as follows:\n\\[ x^2 + 7x - 30 = (x + 10)(x - 3). \\]\nNow, we set the factors equal to zero to find the roots:\n1. \\( x + 10 = 0 \\) which gives \\( x = -10 \\)\n2. \\( x - 3 = 0 \\) which gives \\( x = 3 \\)\nNext, we need to check whether the numerator also equals zero at these roots.\nThe numerator is:\n\\[ x - 3. \\]\nAt \\( x = 3 \\):\n\\[ x - 3 = 3 - 3 = 0. \\]\nThis means that at \\( x = 3 \\), both the numerator and the denominator equal zero, so there is no vertical asymptote at this point; instead, there is likely a hole in the graph at \\( x = 3 \\).\nAt \\( x = -10 \\):\n\\[ x - 3 = -10 - 3 = -13 \\neq 0. \\]\nThis indicates that the numerator does not equal zero at \\( x = -10\\), so there is a vertical asymptote at this point.\nIn conclusion, the graph of \\( y = \\frac{x-3}{x^2 + 7x - 30} \\) has one vertical asymptote.\nThus, the answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]",

        "To determine the number of vertical asymptotes of the graph of the function \n\\[\ny = \\frac{x-3}{x^2 + 7x - 30},\n\\]\nwe need to find the values of \\(x\\) that make the denominator equal to zero, since vertical asymptotes occur where the function tends to infinity, which happens when the denominator approaches zero while the numerator does not approach zero.\nFirst, we will factor the denominator \\(x^2 + 7x - 30\\).
