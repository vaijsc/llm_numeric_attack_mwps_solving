    "solution": "If the arithmetic sequence of three consecutive even integers is $a, a+2, a+4$, we find the sum of the terms by multiplying the average of the first and last term $\\frac{a+(a+4)}{2}$ by the number of terms, $3$.  This gives us the equation \\[\\frac{2a+4}{2}\\cdot3 = 66.\\] Solving for $a$, we find $a = \\boxed{20}$.",

        "To solve the problem, let\u2019s represent the three consecutive even integers. \nWe can denote the first even integer as \\( x \\). Therefore, the next two consecutive even integers would be \\( x + 2 \\) and \\( x + 4 \\).\nAccording to the problem, the sum of these three integers is 66. We can set up the following equation based on this information:\n\\[\nx + (x + 2) + (x + 4) = 66\n\\]\nNow, let\u2019s simplify the left side of the equation:\n\\[\nx + x + 2 + x + 4 = 66\n\\]\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\\[\n3x + 6 = 66\n\\]\nNext, we need to isolate \\( x \\). We can start by subtracting 6 from both sides:\n\\[\n3x = 66 - 6\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n3x = 60\n\\]\nNow, we divide both sides by 3 to solve for \\( x \\):\n\\[\nx = \\frac{60}{3} = 20\n\\]\nThus, the smallest of the three consecutive even integers is \n\\[\n\\boxed{20}\n\\]\nTo make sure we are correct, let's check our work by finding the three integers and verifying their sum:\n1. The first even integer: \\( x = 20 \\)\n2. The second even integer: \\( x + 2 = 22 \\)\n3. The third even integer: \\( x + 4 = 24 \\)\nNow we sum them up:\n\\[\n20 + 22 + 24 = 66\n\\]\nSince the sum is indeed 66, our solution is confirmed. The smallest of the three integers is \\( \\boxed{20} \\).",
        "Let's denote the three consecutive even integers as \\( x \\), \\( x+2 \\), and \\( x+4 \\).\n1. The sum of these integers can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   x + (x + 2) + (x + 4)\n   \\]\n2. Simplifying the sum, we get:\n   \\[\n   x + x + 2 + x + 4 = 3x + 6\n   \\]\n3. According to the problem, this sum equals 66:\n   \\[\n   3x + 6 = 66\n   \\]\n4. Now, we can solve for \\( x \\). First, subtract 6 from both sides:\n   \\[\n   3x = 66 - 6\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   3x = 60\n   \\]\n5. Next, divide both sides by 3:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{60}{3}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = 20\n   \\]\n6.
