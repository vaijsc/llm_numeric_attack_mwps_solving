    "solution": "Let $n$ be the desired the number, so adding the number to the numerator and denominator of $\\dfrac{5}{8}$ gives $\\dfrac{5+n}{8+n}$, and we must have $$\\dfrac{5+n}{8+n} = 0.4.$$  Writing $0.4$ as a fraction, we have $$\\dfrac{5+n}{8+n} = \\dfrac{2}{5}.$$Multiplying both sides by $8+n$ and by 5 gives $$5(5+n) = 2(8+n).$$Expanding both sides gives$$25+5n = 16 + 2n.$$Subtracting 25 and $2n$ from both sides gives $3n=-9$, so $n=\\boxed{-3}.$",

        "Let the number we need to find be \\( x \\). We start with the fraction \\( \\frac{5}{8} \\) and add \\( x \\) to both the numerator and the denominator. This gives us a new fraction:\n\\[\n\\frac{5 + x}{8 + x}\n\\]\nWe want this new fraction to be equal to 0.4. This means we set up the equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{5 + x}{8 + x} = 0.4\n\\]\nNext, we can eliminate the fraction by cross-multiplying:\n\\[\n5 + x = 0.4(8 + x)\n\\]\nNow, we simplify the right side:\n\\[\n5 + x = 0.4 \\times 8 + 0.4x\n\\]\n\\[\n5 + x = 3.2 + 0.4x\n\\]\nNext, we want to isolate \\( x \\).
