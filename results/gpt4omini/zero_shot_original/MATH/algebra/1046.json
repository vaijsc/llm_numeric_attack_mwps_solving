    "solution": "February has 28 days with one extra day during leap years. We want the fewest number of miles, so we go with 28 days in February. The fewest number of days she can walk is $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{28}{3}\\right\\rfloor=9$. So the fewest number of miles she can walk is $9\\cdot4=\\boxed{36}$ miles.",

        "To determine the fewest number of miles Suzanne can walk in February, we need to consider the following:\n1. **Days in February:** February typically has 28 days, but in a leap year, it has 29 days. For this analysis, we'll first calculate for the normal February (28 days) and then for a leap year (29 days).\n2. **Frequency of Walking:** Suzanne walks every third day. Therefore, we need to identify on which days she walks:\n   - If she starts on Day 1, she will walk on days: 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, and 28.\n   - This means she walks 10 days in a 28-day month.\n3. **Calculating Miles:** Since she walks 4 miles each time she walks, we can calculate her total miles in February:\n   - **Total Miles (28 days)**: 10 days \u00d7 4 miles/day = 40 miles.\n4. **Leap Year Calculation:** If February has 29 days, she will also walk on Day 29, making her walk on 11 days:\n   - **Total Miles (29 days)**: 11 days \u00d7 4 miles/day = 44 miles.\n5. **Conclusion:** The fewest number of miles Suzanne can walk in February (in a non-leap year) is:\n   - **40 miles.**\n   If it's a leap year, the total would be 44 miles. \nHence, the final answer is that the fewest number of miles Suzanne can walk in February is **40 miles**.",
        "To determine the fewest number of miles Suzanne can walk in February, we first need to check how many days Suzanne walks within that month.\n1. **Identify the Total Days in February**:\n   February typically has 28 days (29 in a leap year). For simplicity, let's assume it's a non-leap year, so we have 28 days.\n2. **Determine the Walking Schedule**:\n   Suzanne walks every third day. Thus, we need to find out how many days in February fall on her walking schedule.\n3. **Calculate the Walking Days**:\n   - Suzanne starts on day 1 and walks every third day (1st, 4th, 7th, etc.). \n   - The sequence of the days she walks is: \n     - 1st\n     - 4th\n     - 7th\n     - 10th\n     - 13th\n     - 16th\n     - 19th\n     - 22nd\n     - 25th\n     - 28th\n   - We can express the days she walks as: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Day} = 1 + 3n\n     \\]\n     where \\( n = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots \\) until the day exceeds 28.\n4. **Determine How Many Days She Walks**:\n   - As we compile the days from the above analysis, we find she walks on the following days in February:\n     - **1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, 28** (ten days total).\n5. **Calculate Total Miles Walked**:\n   - Suzanne walks 4 miles every time she walks.\n   - Therefore, for 10 walking days:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total miles} = \\text{Number of walking days} \\times \\text{Miles per day} = 10 \\times 4 = 40 \\text{ miles}.\n     \\]\nThus, the fewest number of miles Suzanne can walk in February is **40 miles**.",
        "To determine the fewest number of miles Suzanne can walk in February, let's break this down:\n1. **Determine the number of days in February:** February typically has 28 days (29 days in a leap year). For this calculation, we'll assume a non-leap year.\n2. **Understand her walking schedule:** Suzanne walks four miles every third day. This means that on days 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, and 27, she will walk.\n3. **Count the number of walking days in February:**\n   - The days she walks are: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, and 27.\n   - Count the total: 9 walking days in total.\n4. **Calculate the total distance walked:** \n   - Since she walks 4 miles on each of those days, multiply the number of walking days by the miles per day:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total miles} = 9 \\text{ (days)} \\times 4 \\text{ (miles/day)} = 36 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\nSo, the fewest number of miles Suzanne can walk in February is **36 miles**.",
        "To determine the fewest number of miles Suzanne can walk in February, we first need to know how many days are in February. February typically has 28 days, except in leap years, when it has 29 days. Since we are looking for the minimum, let's consider February with 28 days.\n### Steps:\n1. **Determine her walking schedule:**\n   - Suzanne walks every third day. This means she will walk on days 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, and 27 (these are the multiples of 3).\n2. **Count the walking days in February:**\n   - The walking days from the list above are:\n     - Day 3\n     - Day 6\n     - Day 9\n     - Day 12\n     - Day 15\n     - Day 18\n     - Day 21\n     - Day 24\n     - Day 27\n   This gives us a total of 9 walking days in February.\n3. **Calculate the total miles walked:**\n   - Since Suzanne walks 4 miles each time she walks (which is every third day):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total miles walked} = \\text{Number of walking days} \\times \\text{Miles per walk}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total miles walked} = 9 \\times 4 = 36 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n### Conclusion:\nTherefore, the fewest number of miles Suzanne can walk in February is **36 miles**.",
        "To determine the fewest number of miles Suzanne can walk in February, we need to consider the following:\n1. **Identify the total number of days in February**:\n   - February typically has 28 days, but 29 days in a leap year. For the sake of calculating the fewest number of miles, we will assume February has 28 days.\n2. **Frequency of walking**:\n   - Suzanne walks every third day. Therefore, she walks on days that are multiples of 3.\n3. **Calculate the walking days in February**:\n   - The days in February that are multiples of 3 are 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, and 27. \n   - Counting these, we have a total of 9 walking days.\n4. **Distance walked on walking days**:\n   - On each walking day, Suzanne walks 4 miles.\n   - Therefore, the total distance walked in those 9 days is:\n     \\[\n     9 \\text{ days} \\times 4 \\text{ miles/day} = 36 \\text{ miles}\n     \\]\nNow, we have established that on a normal February with 28 days, Suzanne would walk 36 miles. Since February does not provide additional days (only 28 in a non-leap year), this is the minimum number of miles she can walk.\nThus, the fewest number of miles Suzanne can walk in February is **36 miles**."
