        "To solve the problem, we need to determine the conditions under which the function \n\\[\nf(x) = \\frac{x^2 + 5x + \\alpha}{x^2 + 7x - 44}\n\\]\ncan be expressed as a quotient of two linear functions, which is of the form \n\\[\n\\frac{ax + b}{cx + d}\n\\]\nfor some constants \\(a, b, c, d\\).\nFor this to happen, the polynomial in the numerator and the polynomial in the denominator must have a certain relationship with each other. Specifically, we need the numerator to be a scalar multiple of the denominator, when the denominator does not lead to any extraneous factors other than possible polynomial division.\n### Step 1: Set Up the Equation\nAssume that \n\\[\nx^2 + 5x + \\alpha = k(x^2 + 7x - 44)\n\\]\nfor some scalar \\(k\\). This leads to:\n\\[\nx^2 + 5x + \\alpha = kx^2 + 7kx - 44k.\n\\]\n### Step 2: Equate Coefficients\nFrom the above equation, we can equate coefficients of the corresponding powers of \\(x\\):\n1. **For \\(x^2\\):**\n   \\[\n   1 = k\n   \\]\n   This implies \\(k = 1\\).\n2. **For \\(x\\):**\n   \\[\n   5 = 7k \\implies 5 = 7 \\cdot 1 \\implies 5 = 7, \\text{ which is false.}\n   \\]\nTherefore, we must assume that the polynomial in the numerator is reduced by a factor of the polynomial in the denominator. \n### Step 3: Factor the Denominator \nWe first need the denominator's roots to explore valid conditions:\n\\[\nx^2 + 7x - 44 = 0.\n\\]\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-7 \\pm \\sqrt{7^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (-44)}}{2 \\cdot 1} = \\frac{-7 \\pm \\sqrt{49 + 176}}{2} = \\frac{-7 \\pm \\sqrt{225}}{2} = \\frac{-7 \\pm 15}{2}.\n\\]\nCalculating the roots gives:\n\\[\nx = 4 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x = -11.\n\\]\n### Step 4: Condition for Linear Functions\nNext, let's perform polynomial long division or consider roots. Since \\(f(x)\\) must not be defined at the roots of the denominator, we require:\n\\[\nx^2 + 5x + \\alpha = 0 \\text{ must yield a double root.}\n\\]\nThis necessitates setting up the discriminant condition of \\(x^2 + 5x + \\alpha\\):\n\\[\nb^2 - 4ac = 0.\n\\]\nHere, the coefficients are \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 5\\), and \\(c = \\alpha\\):\n\\[\n5^2 - 4(1)(\\alpha) = 0 \\implies 25 - 4\\alpha = 0 \\implies 4\\alpha = 25 \\implies \\alpha = \\frac{25}{4}.\n\\]\n### Conclusion: Sum of Elements in \\(S\\)\nThe single value derived, \\( \\alpha = \\frac{25}{4} \\), makes the function reducible to a linear form. Thus, since \\(S = \\{\\frac{25}{4}\\}\\) has only one element, the sum of the elements of \\(S\\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{25}{4}}.\n\\]",

The roots of \\( g(x) \\) are found using the quadratic formula:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \\frac{-7 \\pm \\sqrt{49 + 176}}{2} = \\frac{-7 \\pm 15}{2}\n\\]\nThe roots are thus:\n\\[\nx_1 = 4 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x_2 = -11\n\\]\nNow, \\( g(x) \\) factors as:\n\\[\ng(x) = (x - 4)(x + 11)\n\\]\n### Step 2: Criteria for the quotient\nFor \\( f(x) \\) to be expressed as a quotient of two linear functions, we require that the numerator \\( x^2 + 5x + \\alpha \\) be expressible in the terms of \\( g(x) \\).\nWe expect that there exists some linear combination of the factors of \\( g(x) \\) to yield \\( x^2 + 5x + \\alpha \\). Let \\( x^2 + 5x + \\alpha \\) equal \\( k(x - 4)(x + 11) \\) for some constant \\( k \\):\n\\[\nx^2 + 5x + \\alpha = k(x^2 + 7x - 44)\n\\]\nEquating coefficients, we have:\n1. For \\( x^2 \\): \\( 1 = k \\)\n2. For \\( x \\): \\( 5 = 7k \\)\n3. For constant term: \\( \\alpha = -44k \\)\nFrom the first condition, \\( k = 1 \\).

Thus,\n\\[\n\\alpha = -44.\n\\]\n### Step 3: Verifying roots condition\nTo ensure that the numerator intersects or can show behavior similar to \\( g(x) \\), when \\( \\alpha = -44 \\),\n\\[\nf(x) = \\frac{x^2 + 5x - 44}{x^2 + 7x - 44}\n\\]\nHaving \\( g(4) = 0 \\) and check \\( f(4) \\).

Specifically, \\(f(x)\\) should be a rational function that reduces to a linear function if the degree of the numerator equals the degree of the denominator.\nFirst, let's examine the function's components:\n1. **Degree of the numerator:** The degree of the numerator \\(x^2 + 5x + \\alpha\\) is 2.\n2. **Degree of the denominator:** The degree of the denominator \\(x^2 + 7x - 44\\) is also 2.\nFor the entire function \\(f(x)\\) to behave like a linear function, we require that the degrees of the numerator and denominator be equal, which they are (both are 2).\nNext, for two quadratic polynomials, if the leading coefficients are the same and the numerator can be expressed as a scalar multiple of the denominator, the function simplifies to a linear form.\nTo enforce this, we set the numerator as a polynomial that can be derived from the denominator through division. We start by performing polynomial long division.\n1. **Performing polynomial long division** of \\(x^2 + 5x + \\alpha\\) by \\(x^2 + 7x - 44\\):\n   - We notice that the leading term in both is \\(x^2\\), so we can write the division directly:\n   \n\\[\nf(x) = \\frac{x^2 + 5x + \\alpha}{x^2 + 7x - 44} = 1 + \\frac{(5x + \\alpha) - (7x - 44)}{x^2 + 7x - 44} = 1 + \\frac{-2x + (\\alpha + 44)}{x^2 + 7x - 44}\n\\]\nThe condition for \\(f(x)\\) to be a quotient of two linear functions is that the numerator of the residual fraction must equal zero, which simplifies the expression to just the constant \\(1\\):\n\\[\n-2x + (\\alpha + 44) = 0\n\\]\nSetting the coefficients equal to zero gives:\n1. \\(-2 = 0\\) (not useful),\n2. \\(\\alpha + 44 = 0\\).\nFrom the second equation, we solve for \\(\\alpha\\):\n\\[\n\\alpha + 44 = 0 \\implies \\alpha = -44.\n\\]\nThus, the only value of \\(\\alpha\\) such that \\(f(x)\\) can be expressed as a quotient of two linear functions is \\(-44\\).\nFinally, since \\(S\\) is the set of all such \\(\\alpha\\), the sum of the elements in \\(S\\) is simply:\n\\[\n\\boxed{-44}.\n\\]",

This would imply that the function reduces to a simpler form where the result is a linear expression.\n### Step 1: Analyzing the denominator\nWe start by factoring the denominator:\n\\[\nx^2 + 7x - 44.\n\\]\nTo factor this, we look for two numbers that multiply to \\(-44\\) and add to \\(7\\). These numbers are \\(11\\) and \\(-4\\). Thus, we can factor the denominator as:\n\\[\nx^2 + 7x - 44 = (x + 11)(x - 4).\n\\]\n### Step 2: Setting the numerator in a factorable form\nNext, we express the numerator in the form where it might share a common factor with the denominator. Thus, we require:\n\\[\nx^2 + 5x + \\alpha = k(x + 11)(x - 4)\n\\]\nfor some constant \\(k\\). Expanding the right-hand side we get:\n\\[\nk((x + 11)(x - 4)) = k(x^2 + 7x - 44) = kx^2 + 7kx - 44k.\n\\]\n### Step 3: Comparing coefficients\nWe'll match this expression with the standard form of the numerator \\(x^2 + 5x + \\alpha\\):\n1. The coefficient of \\(x^2\\) implies \\(k = 1\\).\n2. The coefficient of \\(x\\) gives us \\(7k = 5\\), leading us to \\(7 = 5\\), which indicates no value of \\(k\\) exists to satisfy this with \\(k = 1\\). \nInstead, we need the numerator to factor having either \\((x + 11)\\) or \\((x - 4)\\) as a factor. Hence, we will set each condition separately:\n### Step 4: Finding \\(\\alpha\\) such that \\(x + 11\\) is a factor\nConsidering first that \\(x + 11\\) is a factor of \\(x^2 + 5x + \\alpha = 0\\) when \\(x = -11\\):\n\\[\n(-11)^2 + 5(-11) + \\alpha = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 121 - 55 + \\alpha = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\alpha = -66.\n\\]\n### Step 5: Finding \\(\\alpha\\) such that \\(x - 4\\) is a factor\nNext, consider the possibility of \\(x - 4\\) being a factor when \\(x = 4\\):\n\\[\n(4)^2 + 5(4) + \\alpha = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 16 + 20 + \\alpha = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\alpha = -36.\n\\]\n### Step 6: Collecting the values of \\(\\alpha\\)\nThus, the set \\(S\\) consisting of all possible values of \\(\\alpha\\) is \n\\[\nS = \\{-66, -36\\}.\n\\]\n### Step 7: Finding the sum of the elements of \\(S\\)\nFinally, we calculate the sum of the elements in \\(S\\):\n\\[\n-66 + (-36) = -102.\n\\]\nTherefore, the sum of the elements of \\(S\\) is \n\\[\n\\boxed{-102}.\n\\]",

For \\(f(x)\\) to simplify to a ratio of linear functions, the degree of the numerator must equal the degree of the denominator.
