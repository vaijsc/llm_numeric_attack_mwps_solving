        "To solve the quadratic equation \\( x^2 - x - 1 = 0 \\) by completing the square, we will follow these steps systematically. \n1. Start with the original quadratic equation: \n   \\[\n   x^2 - x - 1 = 0\n   \\]\n2. To complete the square, we first need to isolate the constant term on one side of the equation.

Add \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) to both sides to maintain the equality:\n   \\[\n   x^2 - x + \\frac{1}{4} = 1 + \\frac{1}{4}\n   \\]\n5. The left side is now a perfect square:\n   \\[\n   \\left( x - \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^2 = 1 + \\frac{1}{4}\n   \\]\n6.
