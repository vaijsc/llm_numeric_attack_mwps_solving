    "solution": "Let $a$ be Alex's age, $b$ be Bob's age, $c$ be Camille's age, and $d$ be Danielle's age. We can express the information given in the problem with the following system of linear equations:\n\\begin{align*}\na + b + d &= 14c \\\\\na + b &= 6c \\\\\nb &= d - a - 2\n\\end{align*} Substituting for $a+b$ in terms of $c$ into the first equation gives $d = 8c$. Rearranging the third equation gives $a + b = d - 2$, and substituting for $a+b$ in terms of $c$ gives $d - 2 = 6c$. Substituting $8c$ for $d$ gives $8c - 2 = 6c$, so $c = \\boxed{1}$.",

        "To find Camille's age, let\u2019s denote her age as \\( C \\), Alex's age as \\( A \\), Bob's age as \\( B \\), and Danielle's age as \\( D \\). We have the following information:\n1. The sum of Alex, Bob, and Danielle's ages is fourteen times Camille's age:\n   \\[\n   A + B + D = 14C\n   \\]\n2. The sum of Alex and Bob's ages is six times Camille's age:\n   \\[\n   A + B = 6C\n   \\]\n3. Bob\u2019s age is two years less than the difference in ages of Danielle and Alex:\n   \\[\n   B = D - A - 2\n   \\]\nNow, let's start solving these equations step by step.\nFrom the second equation, we can express \\( A + B \\) in terms of \\( C \\):\n\\[\nA + B = 6C\n\\]\nSubstituting \\( A + B = 6C \\) into the first equation \\( A + B + D = 14C \\), we get:\n\\[\n6C + D = 14C\n\\]\nSubtracting \\( 6C \\) from both sides:\n\\[\nD = 14C - 6C\n\\]\nSimplifying gives us:\n\\[\nD = 8C\n\\]\nNow we have expressions for both \\( D \\) and \\( A + B \\):\n1. \\( D = 8C \\)\n2. \\( A + B = 6C \\)\nNext, we need to use the third equation \\( B = D - A - 2 \\):\nSubstituting \\( D = 8C \\) into this equation:\n\\[\nB = 8C - A - 2\n\\]\nWe can now substitute \\( B \\) from this equation back into the equation \\( A + B = 6C \\):\n\\[\nA + (8C - A - 2) = 6C\n\\]\nSimplifying this equation:\n\\[\n8C - 2 = 6C\n\\]\nAdding 2 to both sides:\n\\[\n8C = 6C + 2\n\\]\nSubtracting \\( 6C \\) from both sides gives:\n\\[\n2C = 2\n\\]\nDividing by 2:\n\\[\nC = 1\n\\]\nSo, Camille's age is \\( \\boxed{1} \\).\nTo verify, we can calculate the ages of Alex, Bob, and Danielle:\n1. If \\( C = 1 \\), then \\( D = 8C = 8 \\) and \\( A + B = 6C = 6 \\).\n2. Thus, \\( A + B = 6 \\) and using \\( B = D - A - 2 \\) becomes \\( B = 8 - A - 2 \\), or rearranging gives \\( B = 6 - A \\).\n   \\[\n   6 - A = 8 - A - 2\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the above gives:\n   \\[\n   6 - A = 6 - A\n   \\]\n   This is true for any \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) such that \\( A + B = 6 \\).\nThis confirms that the calculations are accurate, and Camille is indeed \\( \\boxed{1} \\) year old.",
        "Let's denote the ages of Alex, Bob, Camille, and Danielle as \\( A \\), \\( B \\), \\( C \\), and \\( D \\) respectively. We will set up equations based on the information given.\n1.

Bob's age is two years less than the difference in ages of Danielle and Alex:\n   \\[\n   B = D - A - 2 \\tag{3}\n   \\]\nNow let's solve these equations step by step.\nFrom equation (2), we can express \\( D \\) in terms of \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and \\( C \\):\n\\[\nD = 14C - (A + B) = 14C - 6C = 8C \\tag{4}\n\\]\nNext, we will substitute equation (4) into equation (3):\n\\[\nB = (8C) - A - 2\n\\]\nRearranging gives us:\n\\[\nB + A = 8C - 2 \\tag{5}\n\\]\nFrom equation (2), we have \\( A + B = 6C \\).

Substituting \\( D \\) into equation (3):\n\\[\nB = 8 - A - 2 \\\\\nB = 6 - A \\tag{8}\n\\]\nNow we can substitute equation (8) back into equation (6):\n\\[\nA + (6 - A) = 6 \\\\\n6 = 6 \\text{ (always true)}\n\\]\nThis means that we can choose any \\( A \\), and subsequently determine \\( B \\):\nUsing \\( B = 6 - A \\):\n- If \\( A = 0 \\), then \\( B = 6 \\)\n- If \\( A = 1 \\), then \\( B = 5 \\)\n- If \\( A = 2 \\), then \\( B = 4 \\)\n- If \\( A = 3 \\), then \\( B = 3 \\)\n- If \\( A = 4 \\), then \\( B = 2 \\)\n- If \\( A = 5 \\), then \\( B = 1 \\)\n- If \\( A = 6 \\), then \\( B = 0 \\)\nLet's summarize the ages with an example:\n- If \\( A = 2 \\), then \\( B = 4 \\) and Danielle is 8 (from \\( D = 8 \\)). \nRegardless of other solutions, we find that the critical age of Camille is 1.
