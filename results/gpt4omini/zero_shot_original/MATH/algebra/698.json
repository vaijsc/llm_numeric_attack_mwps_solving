        "To determine the maximum number of workers the company can hire before going bankrupt, we need to find the point where the company's money reaches zero. The equation of the money the company has is given by:\n\\[\ny = -265x + 2800\n\\]\nHere, \\( y \\) represents the amount of money the company has, and \\( x \\) is the number of workers hired. We need to find the value of \\( x \\) when \\( y = 0 \\).\n1. Set the equation equal to zero:\n\\[\n0 = -265x + 2800\n\\]\n2. Rearrange the equation to solve for \\( x \\):\n\\[\n265x = 2800\n\\]\n3. Divide both sides by 265:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{2800}{265}\n\\]\nNow we can perform the division:\n\\[\nx \\approx 10.566\n\\]\nSince \\( x \\) represents the number of workers, it must be a whole number. We take the largest whole number less than or equal to 10.566, which is 10.\nThus, the maximum number of workers the company can hire before it has no money left is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{10}\n\\]",
        "To find the maximum number of workers the company can hire before going bankrupt, we start by analyzing the equation given:\n\\[\ny = -265x + 2800\n\\]\nHere, \\(y\\) represents the amount of money the company has, and \\(x\\) represents the number of workers hired. The company goes bankrupt when it has no money left, which occurs when \\(y\\) equals zero.\nWe set the equation equal to zero to find the number of workers at which the company has no money:\n\\[\n0 = -265x + 2800\n\\]\nNext, we solve for \\(x\\):\n1.

Therefore, we take the integer part of this value. The maximum whole number of workers that can be hired without going bankrupt is:\n\\[\nx = 10\n\\]\nTo confirm this calculation, let's calculate the amount of money the company has when \\(x = 10\\):\n\\[\ny = -265(10) + 2800\n\\]\n\\[\ny = -2650 + 2800\n\\]\n\\[\ny = 150\n\\]\nNext, let's check what happens when \\(x = 11\\):\n\\[\ny = -265(11) + 2800\n\\]\n\\[\ny = -2915 + 2800\n\\]\n\\[\ny = -115\n\\]\nWhen \\(x = 11\\), the company has negative money, indicating bankruptcy.
