    "solution": "We will consider two cases.\n\nCase 1: $x-3$ is nonnegative.  In this case, we have $|x-3| = x-3$.  Also, if $x-3$ is nonnegative, then $3-x$ (which is $-1$ times $x-3$) is nonpositive, which means that $|3-x| = -(3-x)$.  So, substituting for the absolute values in the original equation, we have  \\[x-3 - (3-x) -1 = 3.\\]Solving this equation gives $x = 5$.\n\nCase 2: $x-3$ is negative. In this case, we have $|x-3| = -(x-3)$.  Also, when $x-3$ is negative, then $3-x$ is positive, so $|3-x| = 3-x$.  So, substituting for the absolute values in the original equation, we have  \\[-(x-3) + 3-x - 1 = 3.\\]Solving this equation gives $x = 1$.\n\nCombining our cases, the sum of the values of $x$ that satisfy the equation is $\\boxed{6}$.\n\nNotice that we could have solved this equation even faster by noticing that $|3-x| = |(-1)(x-3)| = |(-1)||x-3| = |x-3|$, so the original equation simplifies to $2|x-3| - 1 = 3$, which gives us $|x-3| = 2$.  From here, we see that $x$ is 2 away from 3 on the number line, so $x$ is 5 or 1.",

        "To solve the equation \\( |x-3| + |3-x| -1 = 3 \\), we first notice that \\( |x-3| \\) and \\( |3-x| \\) are equal. Specifically, the equation can be simplified as follows:\n\\[\n|x-3| + |3-x| = |x-3| + |x-3| = 2|x-3|\n\\]\nThus, we can rewrite the original equation:\n\\[\n2|x-3| - 1 = 3\n\\]\nNext, adding 1 to both sides results in:\n\\[\n2|x-3| = 4\n\\]\nNow dividing each side by 2 gives:\n\\[\n|x-3| = 2\n\\]\nThis absolute value equation \\( |x-3| = 2 \\) leads to two cases:\n1. \\( x - 3 = 2 \\)\n2. \\( x - 3 = -2 \\)\n**Solving the first case**:\n\\[\nx - 3 = 2 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = 5\n\\]\n**Solving the second case**:\n\\[\nx - 3 = -2 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = 1\n\\]\nNow we have the solutions \\( x = 5 \\) and \\( x = 1 \\).
