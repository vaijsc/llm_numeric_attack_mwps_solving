        "To solve the problem, we need to assign the numbers 4, 5, and 6 to the variables \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and \\( C \\) in the expression \\( A ( B - C ) \\) such that the result is minimized.\nOur expression, when evaluated, is given by:\n\\[\nA (B - C)\n\\]\n### Step 1: Understand the Expression\nThe value of the expression depends on both \\( A \\) and \\( (B - C) \\). Therefore, two factors influence the outcome:\n1. \\( A \\) \u2014 if \\( A \\) is large, the product will be larger.\n2. \\( B - C \\) \u2014 the value of this difference would ideally be as small as possible to minimize the overall expression.\n### Step 2: Determine the Value of \\( B - C \\)\nTo minimize \\( A (B - C) \\), we want \\( (B - C) \\) to be as small as possible. Given that \\( B \\) and \\( C \\) can take the values 4, 5, and 6, we can find their possible combinations:\n- \\( B = 5, C = 6 \\) gives \\( B - C = 5 - 6 = -1 \\)\n- \\( B = 4, C = 5 \\) gives \\( B - C = 4 - 5 = -1 \\)\n- \\( B = 6, C = 5 \\) gives \\( B - C = 6 - 5 = 1 \\)\n- \\( B = 6, C = 4 \\) gives \\( B - C = 6 - 4 = 2 \\)\n- \\( B = 5, C = 4 \\) gives \\( B - C = 5 - 4 = 1 \\)\nFrom the above combinations, we see that the smallest possible value of \\( (B - C) \\) occurs when \\( B \\) is either 5 or 4 and \\( C \\) is 6 or 5, leading us to \\( (B - C = -1) \\).\n### Step 3: Calculate the Result for Each Case\n1. If \\( B = 5 \\) and \\( C = 6 \\):\n   - The only remaining option for \\( A \\) is 4.\n   - Then, we have:\n   \\[\n   A (B - C) = 4 (5 - 6) = 4 \\times (-1) = -4\n   \\]\n2. If \\( B = 4 \\) and \\( C = 5 \\):\n   - The only remaining option for \\( A \\) is 6.\n   - Then, we have:\n   \\[\n   A (B - C) = 6 (4 - 5) = 6 \\times (-1) = -6\n   \\]\n### Step 4: Compare Both Outcomes\nNow we have two calculations:\n- From \\( (B=5, C=6, A=4) \\): The result is \\(-4\\).\n- From \\( (B=4, C=5, A=6) \\): The result is \\(-6\\).\nAmong these, \\(-6\\) is less than \\(-4\\).\n### Conclusion\nThus, the least possible result of the expression \\( A (B - C) \\) when \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and \\( C \\) are each assigned the values 4, 5, and 6 exactly once is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{-6}\n\\]",

To minimize the overall result, we need to consider how the values of \\( B \\) and \\( C \\) affect the difference \\( (B - C) \\).\n2. **Minimize \\( B - C \\)**:\n   - Since \\( B \\) should be the larger number (to minimize the difference \\( B - C \\)), we can set:\n     - \\( B = 5 \\) and \\( C = 4 \\): This gives us \\( B - C = 5 - 4 = 1 \\).\n     - Alternatively, if \\( B = 6 \\) and \\( C = 5 \\), we get \\( B - C = 6 - 5 = 1 \\).\n   - In both cases, the lowest difference is \\( 1 \\).\n3. **Determine \\( A \\)**:\n   - With \\( A = 4 \\), we then have:\n     \\[\n     A (B - C) = 4 \\times 1 = 4\n     \\]\n   - If we set \\( A = 5 \\), using \\( B = 6 \\) and \\( C = 4 \\) still gives:\n     \\[\n     A (B - C) = 5 \\times 2 = 10\n     \\]\n   - If we set \\( A = 6 \\), we again have:\n     \\[\n     A (B - C) = 6 \\times 1 = 6\n     \\]\n   - None of the configurations give a result lower than \\( 4 \\).\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - After analyzing the available combinations, we see that using \\( A = 4 \\), \\( B = 5 \\), and \\( C = 4 \\) gives the least value.\n   \nThus, the least possible result of the expression \\( A ( B - C ) \\) is \\( \\boxed{4} \\).",
