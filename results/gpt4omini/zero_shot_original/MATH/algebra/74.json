        "We start with the equation given:\n\\[\n2x(x-10) = -50\n\\]\nFirst, we can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by 2:\n\\[\nx(x-10) = -25\n\\]\nNext, we rewrite this equation in standard quadratic form:\n\\[\nx^2 - 10x + 25 = 0\n\\]\nNow, we can factor this quadratic equation. We look for two numbers that multiply to \\(25\\) (the constant term) and add up to \\(-10\\) (the coefficient of \\(x\\)). The numbers \\(-5\\) and \\(-5\\) fit this requirement. Thus, we can factor it as:\n\\[\n(x - 5)(x - 5) = 0\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n(x - 5)^2 = 0\n\\]\nTo find the solutions, we set the factor equal to zero:\n\\[\nx - 5 = 0\n\\]\nThus,\n\\[\nx = 5\n\\]\nSince we have a perfect square, there is only one unique solution for \\(x\\). Therefore, the sum of all possible values of \\(x\\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]",
