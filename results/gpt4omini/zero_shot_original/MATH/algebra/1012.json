        "To solve the inequality \\( x^{-1} > x \\), we start by rewriting it in a more manageable form. \nFirst, note that \\( x^{-1} \\) is equivalent to \\( \\frac{1}{x} \\). Thus, we can rewrite the inequality as:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{x} > x\n\\]\nNext, we'll multiply both sides by \\( x \\). However, we need to be mindful of the sign of \\( x \\): since we are looking for positive integer values, \\( x > 0 \\). We can safely multiply both sides by \\( x \\) without changing the inequality:\n\\[\n1 > x^2\n\\]\nThis implies:\n\\[\nx^2 < 1\n\\]\nNext, we will consider the implications of this inequality. Since we are only interested in positive integers, we need to find values of \\( x \\) such that the inequality \\( x^2 < 1 \\) holds. \nThe positive integers start from 1 and increase upwards (1, 2, 3, ...). Examining the condition \\( x^2 < 1 \\):\n- For \\( x = 1 \\): \\( 1^2 = 1 \\) which is **not** less than 1.\n- For \\( x = 2 \\): \\( 2^2 = 4 \\) which is **not** less than 1.\n- For larger integers, \\( x^2 \\) continues to increase.\nSince \\( x^2 \\) must be less than 1, and since the square of any positive integer is at least 1, we conclude that there are **no positive integers** that satisfy the inequality.\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\]",
        "To solve the inequality \\( x^{-1} > x \\), we can start by rewriting \\( x^{-1} \\) as \\( \\frac{1}{x} \\).

However, we need to be cautious because \\( x \\) must be positive to ensure we do not reverse the inequality. Thus, we multiply both sides by \\( x \\) (valid since \\( x > 0 \\)):\n\\[\n1 > x^2\n\\]\nWe can rearrange this to:\n\\[\nx^2 < 1\n\\]\nTo find the values of \\( x \\), take the square root of both sides:\n\\[\n|x| < 1\n\\]\nSince \\( x \\) must be a positive integer, the only values to consider are those that are less than 1. The positive integers satisfying this requirement are:\n\\[\nx = 1\n\\]\nNow, we need to check if higher integer values could satisfy the original inequality.
