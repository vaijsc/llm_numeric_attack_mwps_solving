        "To find the largest value of \\( a \\) such that the graph of the function \\( f(x) \\) intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to consider both cases of the piecewise function separately.\n### Case 1: \\( x \\geq a \\)\nIn this case, the function is defined as:\n\\[\nf(x) = ax^2\n\\]\nThis is a quadratic function that opens upwards (since the coefficient of \\( x^2 \\) is positive when \\( a > 0 \\)). The vertex of this parabola occurs at \\( x = 0 \\). To find the minimum value of \\( f(x) \\) for \\( x \\geq a \\) (i.e., to understand the lowest point of this part of the graph), we note that:\n- If \\( a \\leq 0 \\), \\( f(x) \\) can take negative values, as \\( ax^2 \\) can be non-positive.\n- For \\( a > 0 \\), the minimum value occurs at \\( x = a \\): \n\\[\nf(a) = aa^2 = a^3.\n\\]\n### Case 2: \\( x < a \\)\nIn this case, the function is defined as:\n\\[\nf(x) = ax + 2a.\n\\]\nThis is a linear function with a slope of \\( a \\) and a \\( y \\)-intercept of \\( 2a \\). The value of \\( f(x) \\) approaches \\( 2a \\) as \\( x \\) goes to negative infinity and can take any real number value depending on \\( a \\).\n### Intersecting Every Horizontal Line\nFor the graph to intersect every horizontal line \\( y = c \\), it must be true that there is a solution to \\( f(x) = c \\) for every \\( c \\in \\mathbb{R} \\).\n1. **For \\( x < a \\)**:\n   - The function \\( f(x) = ax + 2a \\) can take every value below \\( 2a \\) as \\( x \\) decreases, since it is linear and has no downward bound (as \\( x \\to -\\infty \\), \\( f(x) \\to -\\infty \\)).\n   \n2. **For \\( x \\geq a \\)**:\n   - The function \\( f(x) = ax^2 \\) can take values starting from \\( a^3 \\) and increasing towards \\( +\\infty \\). Therefore, the lowest value this part can achieve is \\( a^3 \\).\n### Conditions for Intersection\nTo intersect every horizontal line, we need the lowest value from the quadratic section \\( a^3 \\) to be less than or equal to the highest value from the linear section, which is \\( 2a \\):\n\\[\na^3 \\leq 2a.\n\\]\nTo solve this inequality, we can rearrange it:\n\\[\na^3 - 2a \\leq 0,\n\\]\nFactoring gives:\n\\[\na(a^2 - 2) \\leq 0.\n\\]\nThis inequality holds when \\( a = 0 \\) or \\( a = \\sqrt{2} \\).

        "To determine the largest value of \\( a \\) such that the graph of \\( y = f(x) \\) intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the two cases of the piecewise function \\( f(x) \\).\n1. **For \\( x \\geq a \\)**:\n   The function is defined as:\n   \\[\n   f(x) = ax^2\n   \\]\n   This is a quadratic function that opens upwards (since \\( a > 0 \\)).

The value of this function at \\( x = a \\) is:\n   \\[\n   f(a) = aa + 2a = a^2 + 2a\n   \\]\n### Intersection with Horizontal Lines\nFor the graph of \\( f(x) \\) to intersect every horizontal line \\( y = k \\):\n- For very large \\( y \\), the quadratic part \\( f(x) = ax^2 \\) intersects every horizontal line as \\( x \\to \\infty \\).\n- We need to ensure that the linear part \\( f(x) = ax + 2a \\) can reach all values less than or equal to \\( f(a) = a^2 + 2a \\).\nNow, we examine the behavior of the linear function when \\( x < a \\):\n- The intercept (when \\( x = 0 \\)) is \\( f(0) = 2a \\). \n### Ensure Coverage\nFor the intersection of horizontal lines:\n1. The quadratic function can take values in \\( [0, \\infty) \\) for \\( x \\geq a \\) (since \\( a > 0 \\)).\n2. The linear part must be capable of producing values down to certain limits.\n3. The linear function \\( ax + 2a \\) is linear and strictly decreases if \\( a < 0 \\) and strictly increases if \\( a > 0 \\). However, we need to check the boundaries set by the intersection.\n### Critical Points\nThe last \\( y \\)-value that the linear function can obtain occurs at \\( x = a \\):\n- Thus, for all values \\( y \\leq a^2 + 2a \\) to be reached by the linear portion as \\( x \\) decreases towards negative infinity, we can set a restriction based on \\( k \\le a^2 + 2a \\).\n### Boundary Conditions\nThe transition point is at \\( x = a \\):\n- The linear part intersects at its maximum reach \\( a^2 + 2a \\).\n- The quadratic part intersects as \\( x \\to \\infty \\).\nBy solving for various instances extreme horizontal lines would be made possible intersectionally where differentiators converge, we obtain:\nUltimately, by careful analysis, we find:\n### Conclusion\nThe largest value of \\( a \\) such that the function intersects every horizontal line is when it just touches at the turning point of the quadratic and linear parts, i.e.,\n\\[ \n\\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{(-2)^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 0}}{2 \\cdot 1} = -1 \n\\]\nThus \\( a \\) equates \\( 0 \\), denoting its geometrical relevance and necessary conditions for all horizontal lines to theoretically intersect based on the piecewise constraints.\nTherefore, the largest value of \\( a \\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\]",
