    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "William ran for 75 seconds, which we will have to convert to miles. We know have conversion factors to get from seconds to hours, namely $\\frac{1\\text{ minute}}{60 \\text{ seconds}} = 1$ and $\\frac{1\\text{ hour}}{60 \\text{ minutes}} = 1$. We are also given William's running speed, so $\\frac{8\\text{ miles}}{1 \\text{ hour}} = 1$. Thus, we can find that William ran \\[ 75\\text{ seconds}\\cdot \\frac{1\\text{ minute}}{60 \\text{ seconds}} \\cdot \\frac{1\\text{ hour}}{60 \\text{ minutes}} \\cdot \\frac{8\\text{ miles}}{1 \\text{ hour}} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}\\text{ miles.}\\]",

        "To find out how many miles William ran, we can follow these steps:\n1. **Convert the running speed from miles per hour to miles per second**:\n   - William runs at 8 miles per hour.\n   - There are 3600 seconds in an hour (60 minutes x 60 seconds).\n   - Therefore, to convert miles per hour to miles per second, we use the formula:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Speed in miles per second} = \\frac{8 \\text{ miles per hour}}{3600 \\text{ seconds per hour}} = \\frac{8}{3600} \\text{ miles per second}\n     \\]\n   - Calculating this gives:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{8}{3600} = 0.002222... \\text{ miles per second}\n     \\]\n2. **Calculate the distance covered in 75 seconds**:\n   - Now that we have the speed in miles per second, we can find out how far William runs in 75 seconds by using the formula:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Distance} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time}\n     \\]\n   - Substituting in the speed and time:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Distance} = 0.002222... \\text{ miles per second} \\times 75 \\text{ seconds} \n     \\]\n   - This simplifies to:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Distance} = 0.166666... \\text{ miles}\n     \\]\n3. **Convert the distance into a fraction**:\n   - The distance \\(0.166666...\\) miles can be expressed as \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\) miles.\nThus, the total distance that William ran from his house to school is \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\) miles, or approximately 0.167 miles.",
        "To find out how many miles William ran, we need to convert the time he spent running from seconds to hours, since his speed is given in miles per hour.\n1. **Convert 75 seconds to hours**:\n   - There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are \\(60 \\times 60 = 3600\\) seconds in an hour.\n   - Therefore, to convert 75 seconds to hours:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Hours} = \\frac{75 \\text{ seconds}}{3600 \\text{ seconds/hour}} = \\frac{75}{3600} = \\frac{1}{48} \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n2. **Calculate the distance**:\n   - Using the formula for distance:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Distance} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time}\n     \\]\n   - We know William\u2019s speed is 8 miles per hour and the time is \\(\\frac{1}{48}\\) hours:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Distance} = 8 \\text{ miles/hour} \\times \\frac{1}{48} \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n3. **Perform the multiplication**:\n   - \n     \\[\n     \\text{Distance} = \\frac{8}{48} \\text{ miles} = \\frac{1}{6} \\text{ miles}\n     \\]\nSo, the distance William ran is \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) miles.",
        "To determine how many miles William ran, we can use the formula for distance, which is:\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time}\n\\]\n1. **Convert William's speed from miles per hour to miles per second.**  \n   William's speed is 8 miles per hour. Since there are 3600 seconds in an hour, we convert the speed as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Speed in miles per second} = \\frac{8 \\text{ miles}}{3600 \\text{ seconds}} = \\frac{8}{3600} \\text{ miles per second} = \\frac{1}{450} \\text{ miles per second}\n   \\]\n2. **Convert the time from seconds to the appropriate unit.**  \n   William takes 75 seconds to run to school, so we can use this time directly in the distance formula.\n3. **Calculate the distance William ran.**  \n   Using the formula for distance:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time} = \\left(\\frac{1}{450} \\text{ miles per second}\\right) \\times (75 \\text{ seconds})\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the multiplication:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance} = \\frac{1 \\times 75}{450} = \\frac{75}{450}\n   \\]\n   Reducing the fraction:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{75}{450} = \\frac{1}{6} \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\nThus, the distance William ran is \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\) miles.",
