    "solution": "One week is equal to $7$ days, and the plant grows by $5\\%$ each day.  We can work backwards to find the previous size of the plant.  We can reverse the compound interest formula to solve this problem, as if the plant loses five percent of its height every day for $14$ days.  So the height of the plant two weeks ago is equal to $$452\\div(1+0.05)^{14}= 452\\div1.98=228.29$$So, the bean plant was $\\boxed{228.3}$ centimeters tall when Alice first found it.",

        "To determine the height of the bean plant 2 weeks ago, we need to calculate the height of the plant today in reverse, applying the 5% daily growth rate over the 14 days since Alice first noticed it.\n1. **Understanding Growth Rate**: The plant grows by \\(5\\%\\) each day. Therefore, the growth factor for the plant each day is:\n   \\[\n   1 + 0.05 = 1.05\n   \\]\n2. **Calculating the Height 14 Days Ago**: If we denote the height of the plant 2 weeks (14 days) ago as \\( h \\), after \\( n \\) days of growth, the height of the plant can be expressed using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Height after } n \\text{ days} = h \\times (1.05)^n\n   \\]\n   In this case, we want to find \\( h \\) when \\( n = 14 \\) and the height today is \\( 452 \\) cm.
