        "Let's denote the cost of a pencil as \\( p \\) (in cents) and the cost of a jumbo eraser as \\( e \\) (in cents).\nFrom the information given, we can set up the following equations:\n1.

For five pencils and one jumbo eraser:\n   \\[\n   5p + e = 182\n   \\]\nNow, we need to solve these two equations simultaneously.\nFirst, we can eliminate \\( e \\) by subtracting the first equation from the second equation:\n\\[\n(5p + e) - (3p + e) = 182 - 124\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n5p - 3p + e - e = 58 \n\\]\n\\[\n2p = 58\n\\]\nTo find \\( p \\), we divide both sides by 2:\n\\[\np = \\frac{58}{2} = 29\n\\]\nSo, the cost of a pencil is \\( 29 \\) cents.\nNext, we can substitute \\( p \\) back into one of the original equations to find the cost of the eraser \\( e \\).
