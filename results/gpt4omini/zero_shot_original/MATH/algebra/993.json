        "To find the smallest positive four-digit integer that is the product of two consecutive integers, we need to express the problem mathematically.\nLet the two consecutive integers be \\( n \\) and \\( n + 1 \\). The product of these integers can be expressed as:\n\\[\nP = n(n + 1) = n^2 + n\n\\]\nWe want to find the smallest value of \\( P \\) that is at least 1000 (the smallest four-digit number). Therefore, we need to solve the inequality:\n\\[\nn^2 + n \\geq 1000\n\\]\nTo find the threshold for \\( n \\), we can rearrange the inequality:\n\\[\nn^2 + n - 1000 \\geq 0\n\\]\nNext, we can use the quadratic formula to determine the critical points:\n\\[\nn = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\nIn our case, \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 1 \\), and \\( c = -1000 \\). Plugging in these values gives:\n\\[\nn = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (-1000)}}{2 \\cdot 1}\n\\]\n\\[\nn = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 4000}}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nn = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{4001}}{2}\n\\]\nNext, we calculate \\( \\sqrt{4001} \\approx 63.25 \\):\n\\[\nn \\approx \\frac{-1 + 63.25}{2} \\approx \\frac{62.25}{2} \\approx 31.125\n\\]\nSince \\( n \\) must be a whole number, we round up to the next integer, which gives \\( n = 32 \\). Let's check \\( n = 32 \\) and \\( n = 33 \\):\n1. Calculate \\( n = 32 \\):\n\\[\nP = 32 \\times 33 = 1056\n\\]\n2. Calculate \\( n = 31 \\) as a check:\n\\[\nP = 31 \\times 32 = 992\n\\]\nSince 992 is not a four-digit integer, we see that when \\( n = 32 \\), we achieve:\n\\[\nP = 1056\n\\]\nThus, the smallest positive four-digit integer that is the product of two consecutive integers is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1056}\n\\]",
        "To find the smallest positive four-digit integer that is the product of two consecutive integers, we can denote the two consecutive integers as \\( n \\) and \\( n+1 \\). The product of these two integers is given by:\n\\[\nP = n(n+1) = n^2 + n\n\\]\nWe want to find the smallest \\( P \\) that is a four-digit integer, which means we need:\n\\[\n1000 \\leq P < 10000\n\\]\nThis translates to:\n\\[\n1000 \\leq n(n+1) < 10000\n\\]\nFirst, we need to find the lower bound for \\( n \\). We can approximate \\( n(n+1) \\) by considering the equation \\( n^2 \\approx 1000 \\). Taking the square root gives:\n\\[\nn \\approx \\sqrt{1000} \\approx 31.62\n\\]\nSince \\( n \\) must be an integer, we start testing from \\( n = 32 \\):\n1. For \\( n = 32 \\):\n   \\[\n   P = 32 \\times 33 = 1056\n   \\]\n   (This is a four-digit number.)\n2. For \\( n = 31 \\):\n   \\[\n   P = 31 \\times 32 = 992\n   \\]\n   (This is a three-digit number.)\nNext, we can find the upper bound for \\( n \\) by using the approximation \\( n(n+1) < 10000 \\):\nThe equation \\( n^2 + n < 10000 \\) can be simplified to:\n\\[\nn^2 + n - 10000 < 0\n\\]\nFinding the roots of the equation \\( n^2 + n - 10000 = 0 \\) using the quadratic formula:\n\\[\nn = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 40000}}{2} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{40001}}{2}\n\\]\nCalculating \\( \\sqrt{40001} \\) gives approximately \\( 200 \\). Therefore:\n\\[\nn \\approx \\frac{-1 + 200}{2} \\approx 99.5\n\\]\nThis suggests that \\( n \\) could be at most around 99. Thus, we check \\( n = 99 \\):\n1. For \\( n = 99 \\):\n   \\[\n   P = 99 \\times 100 = 9900\n   \\]\n   (This is a four-digit number.)\n2. For \\( n = 100 \\):\n   \\[\n   P = 100 \\times 101 = 10100\n   \\]\n   (This exceeds the upper bound of four-digit integers.)\nThus, we have the four-digit product from \\( n = 32 \\) as \\( 1056 \\) and from \\( n = 99 \\) as \\( 9900 \\).
