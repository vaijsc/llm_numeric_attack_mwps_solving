    "solution": "First, note that $f(x)$ and $f(6x)$ have the same range, because every value assumed by $f(x)$ (at, say, $x=a$) is also assumed by $f(6x)$ (at $x=\\frac a6$), and vice versa.\n\nSince $g(x)=f(6x)+1$, its range is equal to the range of $f(6x)$ with all values increased by $1$. Thus, the range of $g(x)$ is $[-11+1,3+1] = \\boxed{[-10,4]}$.",

        "The function \\( f(x) \\) has the range \\( [-11, 3] \\). This means that for all \\( x \\in (-\\infty, \\infty) \\), the output of \\( f(x) \\) lies between -11 and 3, inclusive.\nNext, we need to determine how the function \\( g(x) = f(6x) + 1 \\) affects the range of \\( f(x) \\).\n1. **Mapping of \\( f(x) \\) to \\( g(x) \\)**: \n   Since \\( g(x) \\) is defined based on \\( f(6x) \\), we can denote the output of \\( f(6x) \\) as \\( f(6x) \\). The argument \\( 6x \\) can take any value in the domain of \\( f(x) \\), which is \\( (-\\infty, \\infty) \\). Therefore, \\( f(6x) \\) will also have the same range as \\( f(x) \\), which is \\( [-11, 3] \\).\n2. **Transforming to \\( g(x) \\)**:\n   The function \\( g(x) = f(6x) + 1 \\) modifies the range of \\( f(6x) \\) by adding 1 to each value. \n   To find the new range after this transformation, we will take each endpoint of the interval for \\( f(6x) \\) and add 1:\n   - The lower endpoint of \\( f(6x) \\): \n     \\[\n     -11 + 1 = -10\n     \\]\n   - The upper endpoint of \\( f(6x) \\): \n     \\[\n     3 + 1 = 4\n     \\]\n3. **Conclusion**: \n   Thus, the new range of \\( g(x) = f(6x) + 1 \\) is obtained by taking the interval \\( [-11, 3] \\), shifting it upwards by 1, resulting in the new range:\n   \\[\n   [-10, 4]\n   \\]\nTherefore, the range of \\( g(x) \\) is \n\\[\n\\boxed{[-10, 4]}.\n\\]",

Regardless of \\( x \\), the output \\( f(6x) \\) will also follow the same range as \\( f(x) \\):\n\\[\nf(6x) \\text{ has the range } [-11, 3].\n\\]\nNext, we need to account for the \\( +1 \\) in the definition of \\( g(x) \\):\nWhen we add \\( 1 \\) to \\( f(6x) \\), we shift the entire range up by \\( 1 \\):\n- The lower bound of the range changes from \\(-11\\) to \\(-11 + 1 = -10\\).\n- The upper bound of the range changes from \\(3\\) to \\(3 + 1 = 4\\).\nThus, after this transformation, the new range for \\( g(x) = f(6x) + 1 \\) is:\n\\[\n[-10, 4].\n\\]\nIn interval notation, the range of \\( g(x) \\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{[-10, 4]}.\n\\]",

So we can express this mathematically as:\n\\[\n-11 \\leq f(x) \\leq 3\n\\]\nNow, we need to determine the range of the function \\( g(x) \\), defined by\n\\[\ng(x) = f(6x) + 1\n\\]\nTo find the range of \\( g(x) \\), we will first analyze how this transformation will affect the range of \\( f(x) \\).\n1. **Transforming the values:**\n   Since \\( g(x) = f(6x) + 1 \\), we first focus on the expression \\( f(6x) \\). The term \\( 6x \\) simply scales the input into \\( f \\) but does not affect its range, as \\( f \\) is defined for all real numbers and thus covers its entire range regardless of the input.\n2. **Applying the range of \\( f(x) \\):**\n   Since the range of \\( f(x) \\) is \\( [-11, 3] \\), we have:\n   \\[\n   -11 \\leq f(6x) \\leq 3\n   \\]\n3. **Shifting the range by 1:**\n   Next, we add 1 to each part of the inequality to find the new range of \\( g(x) \\):\n   \\[\n   -11 + 1 \\leq f(6x) + 1 \\leq 3 + 1\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   -10 \\leq g(x) \\leq 4\n   \\]\nThus, the range of \\( g(x) \\) is from \\(-10\\) to \\(4\\).\n4. **Final result:**\nThe range of \\( g(x) \\) in interval notation is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{[-10, 4]}\n\\]",
        "To determine the range of the function \\( g(x) = f(6x) + 1 \\), we first need to understand the properties of the original function \\( f(x) \\).\nGiven that the domain of \\( f(x) \\) is \\( (-\\infty, \\infty) \\) and the range is \\( [-11, 3] \\), this means that the output values of \\( f(x) \\) can vary between \\(-11\\) and \\(3\\), inclusive.\nNow, we can analyze the transformation applied to \\( f(x) \\) in defining \\( g(x) \\):\n1. **Input Transformation**: The function \\( g(x) \\) inputs \\( 6x \\) into \\( f \\). However, since \\( f \\) has the domain of all real numbers, this does not limit the values of \\( 6x \\) and \\( f(6x) \\) can still take any value within the range of \\( f(x) \\). Therefore, the values of \\( f(6x) \\) will also lie within \\( [-11, 3] \\).\n2. **Output Transformation**: Next, the function \\( g(x) \\) adds \\( 1 \\) to \\( f(6x) \\).
