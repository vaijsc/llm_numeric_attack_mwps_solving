        "To find a person's daily caloric requirement based on the information given, we can set up the problem using the relationship between the calories from the snack-size tin of peaches and the percentage of the daily caloric requirement it represents.\n1. We know that the snack-size tin of peaches has \\( 40 \\) calories.\n2. It is given that these \\( 40 \\) calories constitute \\( 2\\% \\) of a person's daily caloric requirement.\nLet \\( x \\) represent the daily caloric requirement. According to the problem, we can express this relationship mathematically as follows:\n\\[\n2\\% \\text{ of } x = 40\n\\]\nNext, we convert \\( 2\\% \\) into a decimal for calculation:\n\\[\n2\\% = \\frac{2}{100} = 0.02\n\\]\nNow we can rewrite the equation:\n\\[\n0.02x = 40\n\\]\nTo find \\( x \\), we solve the equation by dividing both sides by \\( 0.02 \\):\n\\[\nx = \\frac{40}{0.02}\n\\]\nCalculating the right side:\n\\[\nx = 40 \\div 0.02 = 40 \\times \\frac{100}{2} = 40 \\times 50 = 2000\n\\]\nThus, the person's daily caloric requirement is \n\\[\n\\boxed{2000} \\text{ calories.}\n\\]",
        "To find a person's daily caloric requirement based on the information given, we can set up the following equation:\nThe snack-size tin of peaches has 40 calories, which is stated to be \\(2\\%\\) of a person's daily caloric requirement. We can represent the daily caloric requirement as \\(x\\).\nThis setup gives us the equation:\n\\[\n0.02x = 40\n\\]\nTo solve for \\(x\\), we need to isolate \\(x\\). We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by \\(0.02\\):\n\\[\nx = \\frac{40}{0.02}\n\\]\nCalculating the right side:\n\\[\nx = 40 \\div 0.02 = 40 \\times 50 = 2000\n\\]\nThus, the daily caloric requirement is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2000} \\text{ calories}\n\\]",
        "To find the total daily caloric requirement based on the information given, we start with the fact that the snack-size tin of peaches contains 40 calories, and this represents 2% of a person's daily caloric requirement.\nLet\u2019s denote the total daily caloric requirement as \\( x \\).\nAccording to the information provided, 2% of \\( x \\) is equal to 40 calories. We can express this mathematically as:\n\\[\n0.02x = 40\n\\]\nNext, we need to isolate \\( x \\).

        "To find a person's daily caloric requirement based on the given information, we can follow these steps:\n1. **Identify the percent of daily requirement that the snack-size tin of peaches represents**:\n   - We know that the snack-size tin of peaches has 40 calories and that this amount represents 2% of a person's daily caloric requirement.\n2. **Set up the equation**:\n   - Let \\( x \\) represent the total daily caloric requirement.\n   - According to the information given, 2% of \\( x \\) is equal to 40 calories. We can express this mathematically as:\n   \\[\n   0.02x = 40\n   \\]\n3. **Solve for \\( x \\)**:\n   - To find \\( x \\), we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.02:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{40}{0.02}\n   \\]\n4. **Calculate the right-hand side**:\n   - Dividing 40 by 0.02 gives:\n   \\[\n   x = 40 \\div 0.02 = 2000\n   \\]\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The total daily caloric requirement is \\( 2000 \\) calories.\nThus, a person's daily caloric requirement is **2000 calories**.",
