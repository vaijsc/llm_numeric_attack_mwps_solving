        "To find out how many kilowatt-hours of electricity the $XYZ$ company used in January, we first need to break down the total cost into rent and electricity costs.\n1. **Determine the rent cost for January:**\n   The company pays $5,000 for rent each month. Therefore:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Rent cost} = 5000\n   \\]\n2. **Identify the total cost for January:**\n   The total cost for January is provided as $16,520.25.\n3. **Calculate the total cost for electricity:**\n   To find the total electricity cost, we need to subtract the rent cost from the total cost:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost for electricity} = \\text{Total cost} - \\text{Rent cost}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values we have:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost for electricity} = 16520.25 - 5000 = 11520.25\n   \\]\n4. **Determine the cost per kilowatt-hour:**\n   The problem states that the electricity rate is $1.45 per kilowatt-hour.\n5. **Find the number of kilowatt-hours used:**\n   To find out how many kilowatt-hours were used, we can use the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of kilowatt-hours} = \\frac{\\text{Total cost for electricity}}{\\text{Cost per kilowatt-hour}}\n   \\]\n   Substituting in the values we have:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of kilowatt-hours} = \\frac{11520.25}{1.45}\n   \\]\n6. **Perform the division:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of kilowatt-hours} = 7937.14\n   \\]\n   Since the number of kilowatt-hours should be a whole number (as you typically can't use a fraction of a kilowatt-hour in billing), we round this number. Thus:\nThe $XYZ$ company used approximately \\( \\boxed{7937} \\) kilowatt-hours of electricity in January.",
        "To find out how many kilowatt-hours of electricity the $XYZ$ company used in January, we can start by calculating the total amount spent on electricity.\n1. **Calculate the total fixed costs**: The monthly rent is given as \\$5,000. \n2. **Calculate the remaining cost for electricity**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Cost} = \\text{Rent} + \\text{Electricity Cost}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the known values:\n   \\[\n   16,520.25 = 5,000 + \\text{Electricity Cost}\n   \\]\n   To find the electricity cost, we subtract the rent from the total cost:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Electricity Cost} = 16,520.25 - 5,000 = 11,520.25\n   \\]\n3. **Determine the cost per kilowatt-hour**: We know that the electricity cost is \\$1.45 per kilowatt-hour.\n4. **Calculate the total kilowatt-hours used**:\n   To find the number of kilowatt-hours, we can use the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Electricity Cost} = \\text{Cost per kWh} \\times \\text{kWh used}\n   \\]\n   Rearranging this to find the kWh used gives us:\n   \\[\n   \\text{kWh used} = \\frac{\\text{Electricity Cost}}{\\text{Cost per kWh}}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the known values:\n   \\[\n   \\text{kWh used} = \\frac{11,520.25}{1.45}\n   \\]\n5. **Perform the calculation**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{kWh used} = 7,946.5\n   \\]\nThus, the $XYZ$ company used approximately **7,946.5 kilowatt-hours** of electricity in January.",
