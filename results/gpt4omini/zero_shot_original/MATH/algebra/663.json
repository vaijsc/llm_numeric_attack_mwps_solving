        "To solve the equation \\(x^2 = -|x|\\), we begin by analyzing both sides of the equation.\n1. **Understanding \\( -|x| \\)**: The right-hand side, \\(-|x|\\), is always non-positive (i.e., \\(0\\) or negative) because the absolute value \\(|x|\\) is always non-negative. Thus, \\(-|x|\\) is \\(0\\) when \\(x=0\\) and negative for any non-zero \\(x\\).\n2. **Analyzing the left-hand side \\(x^2\\)**: The left-hand side, \\(x^2\\), is always non-negative for all real numbers \\(x\\).\nFrom the above two points, we can conclude:\n\\[\nx^2 \\geq 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad -|x| \\leq 0.\n\\]\nThis implies that for the equation \\(x^2 = -|x|\\) to hold true, both sides must equal \\(0\\). Therefore, we must have:\n\\[\nx^2 = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad -|x| = 0.\n\\]\n3. **Finding possible values of \\(x\\)**:\n- From \\(x^2 = 0\\), we get:\n  \\[\n  x = 0.\n  \\]\n- From \\(-|x| = 0\\), we also have:\n  \\[\n  |x| = 0 \\implies x = 0.\n  \\]\nThus, \\(x = 0\\) is the only candidate for a solution.\n4. **Verifying the solution**:\nSubstituting \\(x=0\\) back into the original equation:\n\\[\n0^2 = -|0| \\implies 0 = 0.\n\\]\nThis confirms that \\(x = 0\\) satisfies the equation.\n5. **Conclusion**:\nSince \\(x=0\\) is the only solution, we conclude that the number of solutions to the equation \\(x^2 = -|x|\\) is \n\\[\n\\boxed{1}.\n\\]",
        "To solve the equation \\( x^2 = -|x| \\), we will analyze both sides of the equation based on the properties of \\( x \\).\n**1.
