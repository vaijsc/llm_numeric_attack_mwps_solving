    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "From the first equation, we can see that $x = \\frac{5}{2}y$. Substituting for $x$ in the second equation, we obtain $3\\left(\\frac{5}{2}y\\right) - 4y = 7$, which reduces to $y = 2$. Solving for $x$, we find that $x = 5$. Therefore, $Z = (5, 2)$ and our answer is $5 + 2 = \\boxed{7}$.",
