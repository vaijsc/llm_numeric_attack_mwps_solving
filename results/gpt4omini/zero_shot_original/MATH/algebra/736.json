From the problem conditions, we have the equations \\begin{align*}\na+b+c+d+e&=100\\\\\nb&=1.5a\\\\\nc+d&=2(a+b)\\\\\ne&=10\n\\end{align*} Plugging in the value of $e$ into the first equation, we have $a+b+c+d=90$. Substituting the third original equation into this last equation, we have $a+b+2(a+b)=90\\Rightarrow a+b=30$. From the second original equation, we have $b=1.5a\\Rightarrow a=\\frac{2}{3}b$. Substituting this last equation into the equation $a+b=30$ to eliminate $a$, we have $\\frac{2}{3}b+b=30$, so $b=18$. Thus, Runner $B$ ran $\\boxed{18}$ miles.",

        "Let \\( x \\) represent the distance that Runner A runs. Therefore, the distance Runner B runs can be expressed as:\n\\[\n1.5x\n\\]\nLet the combined distance that Runners C and D run be denoted as \\( y \\). According to the problem, it is stated that the combined portion for Runners C and D is twice the length of the combined portion for Runners A and B. This can be written as:\n\\[\ny = 2(x + 1.5x) = 2(2.5x) = 5x\n\\]\nNow, we need to consider the total distance run by all the runners. The equation for the total distance covered by all five runners can be set up as follows:\n\\[\nx + 1.5x + y + 10 = 100\n\\]\nSubstituting \\( y = 5x \\) into the equation gives:\n\\[\nx + 1.5x + 5x + 10 = 100\n\\]\nCombining like terms:\n\\[\n(1 + 1.5 + 5)x + 10 = 100\n\\]\n\\[\n7.5x + 10 = 100\n\\]\nNext, we isolate \\( 7.5x \\):\n\\[\n7.5x = 100 - 10\n\\]\n\\[\n7.5x = 90\n\\]\nTo find \\( x \\), we divide both sides by \\( 7.5 \\):\n\\[\nx = \\frac{90}{7.5} = 12\n\\]\nNow that we have found \\( x \\), we can now calculate the distance Runner B runs:\n\\[\n\\text{Distance for Runner B} = 1.5x = 1.5 \\times 12 = 18\n\\]\nThus, the distance that Runner B ran is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{18} \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n### Verification:\nLet's verify our calculations.\n1. Runner A runs \\( x = 12 \\) miles.\n2. Runner B runs \\( 1.5x = 18 \\) miles.\n3. Runners C and D together run \\( y = 5x = 60 \\) miles.\n4. Runner E runs the last 10 miles.\nNow we add all these distances together:\n\\[\n12 + 18 + 60 + 10 = 100\n\\]\nThe calculations are correct; therefore, Runner B ran \\( \\boxed{18} \\) miles.",
        "Let the distance that Runner A runs be denoted as \\( x \\) miles. Then, since Runner B's portion is \\( 1.5 \\) times that of Runner A's, we have:\n\\[\n\\text{Distance for Runner B} = 1.5x\n\\]\nNext, we need to determine the combined distance for Runners C and D. According to the problem, the combined portion for Runners C and D is twice the length of the combined portion for Runners A and B. First, we calculate the combined distance for Runners A and B:\n\\[\n\\text{Combined distance for A and B} = x + 1.5x = 2.5x\n\\]\nThus, the combined distance for Runners C and D will be:\n\\[\n\\text{Combined distance for C and D} = 2 \\times (2.5x) = 5x\n\\]\nNext, we know that Runner E runs the last \\( 10 \\) miles of the race. Now we can put all the distances together. The total distance covered by all runners is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total distance} = \\text{Distance for A} + \\text{Distance for B} + \\text{Distance for C} + \\text{Distance for D} + \\text{Distance for E}\n\\]\nSubstituting the distances we have:\n\\[\n100 = x + 1.5x + 5x + 10\n\\]\nCombining the distances:\n\\[\n100 = (x + 1.5x + 5x) + 10 = (7.5x) + 10\n\\]\nWe can isolate \\( 7.5x \\) by subtracting \\( 10 \\) from both sides:\n\\[\n100 - 10 = 7.5x\n\\]\n\\[\n90 = 7.5x\n\\]\nNow, we solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides by \\( 7.5 \\):\n\\[\nx = \\frac{90}{7.5} = 12\n\\]\nNow we know that Runner A runs \\( 12 \\) miles. To find the distance that Runner B runs, we substitute \\( x \\) back into the equation for Runner B's distance:\n\\[\n\\text{Distance for Runner B} = 1.5x = 1.5 \\times 12 = 18\n\\]\nThus, the distance that Runner B ran is \n\\[\n\\boxed{18} \\text{ miles.}\n\\]\nTo confirm, we can calculate the distances for other runners:\n- Runner A: \\( 12 \\) miles\n- Runner B: \\( 18 \\) miles\n- Combined distance for A and B: \\( 12 + 18 = 30 \\) miles\n- Combined distance for C and D: \\( 2 \\times 30 = 60 \\) miles \nIf we denote the combined distance for C and D as \\( 60 \\) miles, we see that:\nRunner E runs \\( 10 \\) miles, giving us:\n\\[\n12 + 18 + 60 + 10 = 100\n\\]\nThus, everything checks out, confirming again that the distance Runner B ran is \n\\[\n\\boxed{18} \\text{ miles.}\n\\]",
        "Let \\( x \\) be the distance that Runner A runs. Then, according to the problem, Runner B's distance is \\( 1.5x \\). Thus, the combined distance for Runners A and B is:\n\\[\nx + 1.5x = 2.5x\n\\]\nNext, we are told that the combined distance for Runners C and D is twice that of Runners A and B. Therefore, the distance covered by Runners C and D is:\n\\[\n2 \\times (x + 1.5x) = 2 \\times 2.5x = 5x\n\\]\nNow, we also know that Runner E runs the last \\( 10 \\) miles of the race. To find the total distance covered by all runners, we add their distances together:\n\\[\n\\text{Distance by A} + \\text{Distance by B} + \\text{Distance by C and D} + \\text{Distance by E} = 100\n\\]\nBreaking it down, we have:\n\\[\nx + 1.5x + 5x + 10 = 100\n\\]\nCombining the distances covered by Runners A, B, and C and D gives:\n\\[\n7x + 10 = 100\n\\]\nTo solve for \\( x \\), we first isolate \\( 7x \\):\n\\[\n7x = 100 - 10\n\\]\n\\[\n7x = 90\n\\]\nNext, we divide by \\( 7 \\):\n\\[\nx = \\frac{90}{7}\n\\]\nNow we can find the distance run by Runner B, which is \\( 1.5x \\):\n\\[\n1.5x = 1.5 \\times \\frac{90}{7} = \\frac{135}{7}\n\\]\nTherefore, the distance Runner B ran is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{135}{7}} \\text{ miles}\n\\] \nThis can also be expressed as approximately \\( 19.2857 \\) miles if a decimal representation is needed. However, the exact fraction \\( \\frac{135}{7} \\) is the final answer.",
        "Let the length of Runner A's portion be denoted as \\( x \\) miles. Consequently, the length of Runner B's portion, which is \\( 1.5 \\) times that of Runner A's, can be expressed mathematically as:\n\\[\nB = 1.5x\n\\]\nNow, we accumulate the portions of Runners A and B:\n\\[\nA + B = x + 1.5x = 2.5x\n\\]\nAccording to the problem, the combined portion for Runners C and D is twice the length of the combined portion for Runners A and B. Therefore, we can define the combined length for Runners C and D as:\n\\[\nC + D = 2(2.5x) = 5x\n\\]\nGiven that Runner E runs the last \\( 10 \\) miles of the race, we can express the total distance covered by all runners, which sums up to \\( 100 \\) miles:\n\\[\nA + B + C + D + E = 100\n\\]\nSubstituting the values for \\( A \\), \\( B \\), \\( C \\), \\( D \\), and \\( E \\):\n\\[\nx + 1.5x + 5x + 10 = 100\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n(1 + 1.5 + 5)x + 10 = 100\n\\]\n\\[\n7.5x + 10 = 100\n\\]\nNext, we solve for \\( x \\):\n\\[\n7.5x = 100 - 10\n\\]\n\\[\n7.5x = 90\n\\]\n\\[\nx = \\frac{90}{7.5} = 12\n\\]\nNow that we have \\( x \\), which represents the portion of Runner A's run, we can find the portion covered by Runner B:\n\\[\nB = 1.5x = 1.5 \\times 12 = 18\n\\]\nThus, the number of miles that Runner B ran is \n\\[\n\\boxed{18}\n\\]  \nLastly, let\u2019s verify the calculations:\n- Runner A runs \\( x = 12 \\) miles.\n- Runner B runs \\( 1.5x = 18 \\) miles.\n- Combined, Runners A and B run \\( 12 + 18 = 30 \\) miles.\n- Runners C and D run \\( 5x = 5 \\times 12 = 60 \\) miles.\n- Adding Runner E's \\( 10 \\) miles gives us:\n\\[\n12 + 18 + 60 + 10 = 100 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\nThe calculations are consistent and the answer is confirmed:\n\\[\n\\boxed{18}\n\\]",
