        "To factor the expression \\(9z^3 - 27z^2 + 27z\\), we can start by looking for common factors in all the terms.\n1. **Identify common factors:**\n   - The coefficients of the terms are \\(9\\), \\(-27\\), and \\(27\\). The greatest common factor (GCF) of these coefficients is \\(9\\).\n   - Additionally, each term contains at least one factor of \\(z\\). The minimum power of \\(z\\) across the terms is \\(z\\).\n2. **Factor out the common factor:**\n   We can factor out \\(9z\\) from the expression:\n   \\[\n   9z^3 - 27z^2 + 27z = 9z(z^2 - 3z + 3)\n   \\]\n3. **Now look at the quadratic \\(z^2 - 3z + 3\\):**\n   To determine if this quadratic can be factored further, we can check its discriminant.\n   The discriminant \\(\\Delta\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta = b^2 - 4ac\n   \\]\n   where \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = -3\\), and \\(c = 3\\). Substituting these values:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta = (-3)^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times 3 = 9 - 12 = -3\n   \\]\n   Since the discriminant is negative, \\(z^2 - 3z + 3\\) does not have real roots and cannot be factored further over the real numbers.\n4. **Final factored form:**\n   Therefore, the fully factored form of the expression \\(9z^3 - 27z^2 + 27z\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{9z(z^2 - 3z + 3)}\n   \\]",
