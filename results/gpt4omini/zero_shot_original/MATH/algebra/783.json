    "solution": "Since $\\frac37$ is less than 1, the function will always decrease as $x$ increases when $x\\ge0$. So, the largest value in the range will occur when at the smallest value of $x$: $x=0$, giving us the upper bound of $\\left(\\frac{3}{7}\\right)^0=1$. As the value of $x$ increases, the value of $y$ will gradually decrease, approaching (but never reaching) the lower bound of 0. Therefore, the range of this function when $x\\ge0$ is $\\boxed{(0,1]}$",

        "To determine the range of the function \\( f(x) = \\left(\\frac{3}{7}\\right)^x \\), we will follow these steps:\n1. **Analyze the base of the function**: The base of the exponent, \\( \\frac{3}{7} \\), is a positive number less than 1. This tells us that as \\( x \\) increases, \\( f(x) \\) will decrease.\n2. **Evaluate the function at specific points**:\n    - At \\( x = 0 \\):\n      \\[\n      f(0) = \\left(\\frac{3}{7}\\right)^0 = 1\n      \\]\n    - As \\( x \\) approaches infinity (\\( x \\to \\infty \\)):\n      \\[\n      f(x) = \\left(\\frac{3}{7}\\right)^x \\to 0\n      \\]\n3. **Behavior as \\( x \\) varies**: Since \\( \\frac{3}{7} < 1 \\), the expression \\( \\left(\\frac{3}{7}\\right)^x \\) will produce values that start at 1 (when \\( x = 0 \\)) and approach 0 as \\( x \\) increases without bound. \n4. **Monotonicity**: The function is decreasing for \\( x \\in [0,\\infty) \\), meaning that it continuously takes on every value between \\( 0 \\) and \\( 1 \\) but never reaches 0 or exceeds 1.\n5. **Conclusion on the range**: The range of \\( f(x) \\) includes all values greater than 0 but less than or equal to 1. This gives us the interval:\n   \\[\n   (0, 1]\n   \\]\nThus, the range of the function \\( f(x) = \\left( \\frac{3}{7} \\right)^x \\) is \\( (0, 1] \\).",
