        "To find the radius of the circle given by the equation \\(x^2 - 4x + y^2 - 6y - 36 = 0\\), we can start by rewriting the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \\((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\\), where \\((h, k)\\) is the center of the circle and \\(r\\) is the radius.\nFirst, we need to rearrange the given equation: \n\\[\nx^2 - 4x + y^2 - 6y = 36\n\\]\nNext, we complete the square for the \\(x\\) terms and the \\(y\\) terms separately.\nStarting with the \\(x\\) terms: \n\\[\nx^2 - 4x\n\\]\nTo complete the square, take half of the coefficient of \\(x\\) (which is \\(-4\\)), square it, and add it inside the square (while subtracting it outside to keep the equation balanced):\n\\[\n\\left(-\\frac{4}{2}\\right)^2 = 4 \\implies x^2 - 4x + 4\n\\]\nThis gives us:\n\\[\n(x - 2)^2\n\\]\nNow for the \\(y\\) terms:\n\\[\ny^2 - 6y\n\\]\nAgain, take half of the coefficient of \\(y\\) (which is \\(-6\\)), square it, and add it inside the square (and balance the equation by subtracting it):\n\\[\n\\left(-\\frac{6}{2}\\right)^2 = 9 \\implies y^2 - 6y + 9\n\\]\nThis results in:\n\\[\n(y - 3)^2\n\\]\nNow add \\(4\\) and \\(9\\) to both sides of the equation:\n\\[\n(x - 2)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 36 + 4 + 9\n\\]\nCombine the numbers on the right side:\n\\[\n36 + 4 + 9 = 49\n\\]\nSo we have:\n\\[\n(x - 2)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 49\n\\]\nThis is now in the standard form of a circle's equation:\n\\[\n(x - 2)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 7^2\n\\]\nFrom this, we can see that the radius \\(r\\) of the circle is \\(7\\).\nThus, the radius of the circle is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{7}\n\\]",
