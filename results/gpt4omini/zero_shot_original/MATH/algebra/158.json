    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since the perimeter is 12, the sides of the rectangle add up to $12/2 = 6.$  Let $x$ be one side length of the rectangle.  Then the other side length is $6 - x,$ so the area is\n\\[x(6 - x) = 6x - x^2.\\]Completing the square, we get\n\\[-x^2 + 6x = -x^2 + 6x - 9 + 9 = 9 - (x - 3)^2.\\]Thus, the maximum area of the rectangle is $\\boxed{9}$ square inches, which occurs for a $3 \\times 3$ square.",

        "To find the maximum area of a rectangle given a fixed perimeter, we can start by using the relationship between the perimeter and the dimensions of the rectangle.\nLet the length of the rectangle be \\( l \\) and the width be \\( w \\). The formula for the perimeter \\( P \\) of a rectangle is given by:\n\\[\nP = 2l + 2w\n\\]\nGiven that the perimeter is 12 inches, we have:\n\\[\n2l + 2w = 12\n\\]\nDividing by 2 simplifies this to:\n\\[\nl + w = 6\n\\]\nNext, we can express the area \\( A \\) of the rectangle as:\n\\[\nA = l \\times w\n\\]\nWe can use the equation \\( w = 6 - l \\) to express the area in terms of one variable (length \\( l \\)):\n\\[\nA = l \\times (6 - l) = 6l - l^2\n\\]\nNow, we need to find the maximum value of the area function \\( A = 6l - l^2 \\). This is a quadratic equation in terms of \\( l \\), and it opens downward (since the coefficient of \\( l^2 \\) is negative), meaning it has a maximum point.\nTo find the \\( l \\) value at which this maximum occurs, we can use the vertex formula for a parabola defined as \\( Ax^2 + Bx + C \\), where the vertex occurs at \\( l = -\\frac{B}{2A} \\). Here, \\( A = -1 \\) and \\( B = 6 \\):\n\\[\nl = -\\frac{6}{2 \\times -1} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3\n\\]\nNow, substituting \\( l = 3 \\) back into the equation for \\( w \\):\n\\[\nw = 6 - l = 6 - 3 = 3\n\\]\nThus, both the length and width are 3 inches. Now, we can calculate the maximum area:\n\\[\nA = l \\times w = 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\text{ square inches}\n\\]\nThus, the maximum area of the rectangle with a perimeter of 12 inches is \n\\[\n\\boxed{9} \\text{ square inches.}\n\\]",
