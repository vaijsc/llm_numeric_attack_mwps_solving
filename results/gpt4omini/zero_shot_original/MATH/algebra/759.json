        "To determine the degree of the polynomial \\( f(x) - g(x) \\), we start by noting the degrees of the individual polynomials involved.\n1. **Identify the Degree of Each Polynomial**:\n   - \\( f(x) \\) is a polynomial of degree 4.

        "To determine the degree of the polynomial \\( f(x) - g(x) \\), let's analyze the degrees of the individual polynomials involved:\n1. **Identify the degree of \\( f(x) \\)**: \n   - We are given that \\( f(x) \\) is a polynomial of degree 4.
