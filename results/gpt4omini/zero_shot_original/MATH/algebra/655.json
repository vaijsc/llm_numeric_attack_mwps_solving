    "problem": "Connie is starting an exercise program. On June 1, she will do 25 sit-ups. Each day after that, she will increase her number of sit-ups by four. On which date during the month of June will Connie first do more than 100 sit-ups in one day?",

    "solution": "On June $n$th, Connie will do $25 + 4(n-1)$ sit-ups.  In this problem, we are trying to find the smallest positive integer $n$ such that \\[25 + 4(n-1) > 100.\\]  Simplifying the inequality yields $25+4n-4>100$, or $4n>79$.  The smallest positive integer $n$ that satisfies this simplified inequality is $n=20$; hence, Connie will do more than 100 sit-ups in one day on $\\boxed{\\text{June 20}}$.",

        "To determine when Connie will first do more than 100 sit-ups in one day, we can follow these steps:\n1. **Initial Sit-ups and Increment**: \n   - Connie starts with 25 sit-ups on June 1.\n   - Each day, she increases the number of sit-ups by 4.\n2. **Setting up the formula**: \n   The number of sit-ups she does on day \\( n \\) can be represented as:\n   \\[\n   S(n) = 25 + 4(n - 1)\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( S(n) \\) is the number of sit-ups on day \\( n \\), and \\( n \\) is the day of June (where \\( n = 1 \\) for June 1, \\( n = 2 \\) for June 2, and so on).\n3. **Finding when \\( S(n) > 100 \\)**:\n   We want to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that:\n   \\[\n   25 + 4(n - 1) > 100\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this:\n   \\[\n   4(n - 1) > 100 - 25\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   4(n - 1) > 75\n   \\]\n   Now divide both sides by 4:\n   \\[\n   n - 1 > 18.75\n   \\]\n   Adding 1 to both sides gives:\n   \\[\n   n > 19.75\n   \\]\n4. **Finding the smallest integer**:\n   Since \\( n \\) must be a whole number (a day), the smallest integer greater than 19.75 is 20. Thus, we need to find \\( n = 20 \\).\n5. **Determining the date**:\n   The 20th day of June is June 20.\n6. **Verification**:\n   Let's check how many sit-ups she does on June 20:\n   \\[\n   S(20) = 25 + 4(20 - 1) = 25 + 4(19) = 25 + 76 = 101\n   \\]\n   This confirms that on June 20 Connie will do 101 sit-ups, which is indeed more than 100.\nTherefore, the first date during the month of June when Connie will do more than 100 sit-ups in one day is **June 20**.",
        "To determine when Connie will first do more than 100 sit-ups in one day during the month of June, we can follow these steps:\n1. **Identify the Starting Point:**\n   - Connie starts on June 1 with 25 sit-ups.\n2. **Determine the Daily Increase:**\n   - Each subsequent day, she increases her sit-ups by 4.\n3. **Set Up the Formula:**\n   - Let \\( n \\) represent the number of days after June 1. \n   - On day \\( n \\), the number of sit-ups she does can be expressed as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Sit-ups on day } n = 25 + 4n\n     \\]\n4. **Find When She Does More Than 100 Sit-ups:**\n   - We want to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that:\n     \\[\n     25 + 4n > 100\n     \\]\n5. **Solve the Inequality:**\n   - Subtract 25 from both sides:\n     \\[\n     4n > 75\n     \\]\n   - Divide by 4:\n     \\[\n     n > 18.75\n     \\]\n   - Since \\( n \\) must be a whole number, the smallest integer that satisfies this inequality is \\( n = 19 \\).\n6. **Determine the Date:**\n   - If \\( n = 19 \\), that means it will be 19 days after June 1.\n   - Therefore, the date will be:\n     \\[\n     \\text{June 1} + 19 \\text{ days} = \\text{June 20}\n     \\]\n### Conclusion:\nConnie will first do more than 100 sit-ups on **June 20**.",
        "Let's analyze the situation step by step as Connie begins her exercise program:\n1. **Initial Sit-ups**: On June 1, Connie starts with 25 sit-ups.\n2. **Daily Increase**: Each day after June 1, she increases her number of sit-ups by 4.\nNext, we can express the number of sit-ups Connie will do on any given day using a formula.
