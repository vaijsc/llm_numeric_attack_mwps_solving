    "solution": "Call the primes $p$ and $q$. $1488=p^2-q^2=(p-q)\\cdot(p+q)$. If $p$ or $q$ was $2$, $p^2-q^2$ would be odd, so $p$ and $q$ are both odd numbers that are less than $50$. That means $p-q$ and $p+q$ are both even numbers that are less than $100$. $1488=2^4\\cdot3\\cdot31$, so $p+q$ or $p-q$ must be divisible by $31$. The only even multiple of $31$ that is less than $100$ is $62$ so one must equal $62$, and the other must be $1488/62=24$. So, $p=\\frac{62+24}{2}=43$ and $q=\\frac{62-24}{2}=19$. So, the primes are $\\boxed{19 \\text{ and }43}$.",

        "To find two different primes \\( p_1 \\) and \\( p_2 \\) such that \\( p_2^2 - p_1^2 = 1488 \\), we can start by using the difference of squares formula:\n\\[\np_2^2 - p_1^2 = (p_2 - p_1)(p_2 + p_1)\n\\]\nSetting \\( a = p_2 - p_1 \\) and \\( b = p_2 + p_1 \\), we have:\n\\[\nab = 1488\n\\]\nFrom the above expression, we can express \\( p_2 \\) and \\( p_1 \\) in terms of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\):\n\\[\np_2 = \\frac{a + b}{2}, \\quad p_1 = \\frac{b - a}{2}\n\\]\nTo ensure both \\( p_1 \\) and \\( p_2 \\) are integers, both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) must be even, because the sum and difference of \\( p_2 \\) and \\( p_1 \\) must yield even results for the primes. Therefore, we can write \\( a = 2m \\) and \\( b = 2n \\), leading to:\n\\[\n(2m)(2n) = 1488 \\implies 4mn = 1488 \\implies mn = \\frac{1488}{4} = 372\n\\]\nNow we need to find pairs of integers \\( (m, n) \\) such that \\( mn = 372 \\).\nThe factor pairs of 372 are:\n- \\( (1, 372) \\)\n- \\( (2, 186) \\)\n- \\( (3, 124) \\)\n- \\( (4, 93) \\)\n- \\( (6, 62) \\)\n- \\( (12, 31) \\)\n- \\( (31, 12) \\)\n- \\( (62, 6) \\)\n- \\( (93, 4) \\)\n- \\( (124, 3) \\)\n- \\( (186, 2) \\)\n- \\( (372, 1) \\)\nWe only need integer pairs where we can evaluate \\( p_1 \\) and \\( p_2 \\) as less than 50.\nNow let's evaluate pairs of \\( (m, n) \\):\n1. For \\( (12, 31) \\):\n   \\[\n   a = 2m = 24, \\quad b = 2n = 62\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   p_2 = \\frac{24 + 62}{2} = 43, \\quad p_1 = \\frac{62 - 24}{2} = 19\n   \\]\n   Both 43 and 19 are primes.\n2.

        "To solve the problem, we start by setting up the relationship given:\nLet \\( p_1 \\) and \\( p_2 \\) be the two different primes such that:\n\\[\np_1^2 - p_2^2 = 1488\n\\]\nWe can factor the left side using the difference of squares formula:\n\\[\n(p_1 - p_2)(p_1 + p_2) = 1488\n\\]\nNow, we need to find pairs of factors of 1488 that can be expressed in terms of \\( p_1 - p_2 \\) and \\( p_1 + p_2 \\). \nFirst, let\u2019s factor 1488.
