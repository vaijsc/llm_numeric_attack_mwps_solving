        "To simplify the expression \\( |a-b| + a + b \\) given that \\( a < b \\), we will first evaluate \\( |a-b| \\).\nSince \\( a < b \\), we have:\n\\[\na - b < 0\n\\]\nThus, the absolute value is given by:\n\\[\n|a-b| = -(a-b) = b-a\n\\]\nNow we can substitute this back into the original expression:\n\\[\n|a-b| + a + b = (b - a) + a + b\n\\]\nCombining the terms, we have:\n\\[\nb - a + a + b = b + b = 2b\n\\]\nTherefore, the value of \\( |a-b| + a + b \\) when \\( a < b \\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2b}\n\\]",
