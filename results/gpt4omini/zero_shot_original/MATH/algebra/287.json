        "Let's denote the number of rides Simon paid for as \\( r \\).\nThe total cost Simon incurred can be expressed as the sum of the entry fee and the cost of the rides. The entry fee is \\$2.25 and the cost for each ride is \\$1.50. Therefore, the total cost can be calculated using the following equation:\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost} = \\text{Entry fee} + \\text{Cost per ride} \\times \\text{Number of rides}\n\\]\nThis can be written mathematically as:\n\\[\n12.75 = 2.25 + 1.50 \\times r\n\\]\nTo isolate \\( r \\), we first subtract the entry fee from both sides of the equation:\n\\[\n12.75 - 2.25 = 1.50 \\times r\n\\]\nCalculating the left side:\n\\[\n10.50 = 1.50 \\times r\n\\]\nNext, we divide both sides by 1.50 to solve for \\( r \\):\n\\[\nr = \\frac{10.50}{1.50}\n\\]\nCalculating the right side:\n\\[\nr = 7\n\\]\nThus, Simon paid for **7 rides**.",
        "Let's break down the problem step by step.\n1. **Determine the initial cost**: The entry fee to the amusement park is $2.25.\n2. **Identify the total amount Simon spent**: Simon spent a total of $12.75.\n3. **Calculate the amount spent on rides**: \n   We can find out how much Simon spent on rides by subtracting the entry fee from the total amount spent:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Amount spent on rides} = \\text{Total amount} - \\text{Entry fee}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Amount spent on rides} = 12.75 - 2.25 = 10.50\n   \\]\n4. **Determine the cost per ride**: Each ride costs $1.50.\n5. **Calculate the number of rides**: To find out how many rides Simon paid for, we divide the amount spent on rides by the cost of each ride:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of rides} = \\frac{\\text{Amount spent on rides}}{\\text{Cost per ride}}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of rides} = \\frac{10.50}{1.50} = 7\n   \\]\n6. **Conclusion**: Simon paid for a total of **7 rides**.",
        "To find out how many rides Simon paid for, we can start by breaking down the total amount he spent. \nSimon spent a total of $12.75$, which includes both the entry fee and the cost of the rides. The entry fee for the amusement park is $2.25$. \n1. **Calculate the amount spent on rides**:\n   We subtract the entry fee from the total amount spent:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Amount spent on rides} = \\text{Total amount spent} - \\text{Entry fee} = 12.75 - 2.25\n   \\]\n   Performing the subtraction:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Amount spent on rides} = 12.75 - 2.25 = 10.50\n   \\]\n2. **Determine how many rides Simon paid for**:\n   Each ride costs $1.50, so we can find the number of rides by dividing the amount spent on rides by the cost per ride:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of rides} = \\frac{\\text{Amount spent on rides}}{\\text{Cost per ride}} = \\frac{10.50}{1.50}\n   \\]\n   Now, we perform the division:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of rides} = \\frac{10.50}{1.50} = 7\n   \\]\nThus, Simon paid for **7 rides**.",
        "To find out how many rides Simon paid for, we can set up an equation based on the information given in the problem.\n1. Start with the total amount Simon spent, which is \\$12.75.\n2. The entry fee for the amusement park is \\$2.25.\n3. Each ride costs \\$1.50.\nThe total amount Simon spent can be expressed as:\n\\[\n\\text{Total spent} = \\text{Entry fee} + (\\text{Cost per ride} \\times \\text{Number of rides})\n\\]\nSubstituting the known values into the equation, we have:\n\\[\n12.75 = 2.25 + (1.50 \\times r)\n\\]\nwhere \\( r \\) is the number of rides Simon paid for.\n4. First, we need to isolate the term that includes \\( r \\). We do this by subtracting the entry fee from both sides:\n\\[\n12.75 - 2.25 = 1.50 \\times r\n\\]\nCalculating the left side:\n\\[\n12.75 - 2.25 = 10.50\n\\]\nSo the equation simplifies to:\n\\[\n10.50 = 1.50 \\times r\n\\]\n5. Next, we solve for \\( r \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 1.50:\n\\[\nr = \\frac{10.50}{1.50}\n\\]\nCalculating the right side:\n\\[\nr = 7\n\\]\nTherefore, Simon paid for \\( \\boxed{7} \\) rides.",
