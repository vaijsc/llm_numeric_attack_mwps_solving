        "To determine how many total toy cars Aiden has received from Jo by the time he turns 12, we can follow these steps:\n1. **Identify the number of cars received each year:** \n   - On Aiden's 1st birthday, he received 1 car.\n   - On Aiden's 2nd birthday, he received 2 cars.\n   - On Aiden's 3rd birthday, he received 3 cars.\n   - ...\n   - On Aiden's 12th birthday, he received 12 cars.\n2. **Recognize the pattern:** \n   - The number of toy cars Aiden receives each year is equal to his age. Therefore, the total number of cars he receives can be represented as the sum of the first 12 positive integers.\n3. **Calculate the total number of cars using the formula for the sum of the first n integers:** \n   - The formula for the sum of the first n integers is: \n     \\[\n     S_n = \\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\n     \\]\n   - Here, n is 12, since we are calculating the sum up to Aiden's 12th birthday.\n4. **Plug in the value of n:**\n   \\[\n   S_{12} = \\frac{12(12 + 1)}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   S_{12} = \\frac{12 \\times 13}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   S_{12} = \\frac{156}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   S_{12} = 78\n   \\]\nSo, after receiving cars for his 12th birthday, Aiden will have received a total of **78 toy cars** from Jo.",
        "To find out the total number of toy cars Aiden has received from Jo after his 12th birthday, we need to sum the number of cars he received each year from his 1st to his 12th birthday. The number of cars he received corresponds to his age each year: \n- On his 1st birthday, he received 1 car.\n- On his 2nd birthday, he received 2 cars.\n- On his 3rd birthday, he received 3 cars.\n- ...\n- On his 12th birthday, he received 12 cars.\nSo, the total number of cars can be calculated by summing the ages from 1 to 12:\n\\[\n\\text{Total cars} = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12\n\\]\nThis series is an arithmetic series where:\n- The first term (a) is 1.\n- The last term (l) is 12.\n- The number of terms (n) is 12.\nThe formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is:\n\\[\nS_n = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (a + l)\n\\]\nSubstituting the known values into the formula:\n\\[\nS_{12} = \\frac{12}{2} \\times (1 + 12) = 6 \\times 13 = 78\n\\]\nThus, the total number of toy cars Aiden has received from Jo after his 12th birthday is **78**.",
        "To determine the total number of toy cars Aiden has received from Jo after his 12th birthday, we need to calculate the sum of the first 12 natural numbers.
