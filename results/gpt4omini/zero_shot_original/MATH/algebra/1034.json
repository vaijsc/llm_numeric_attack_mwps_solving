        "To solve the problem, we first need to determine how long it takes Alice to run the entire $100$ meters, given the information provided about Beatrice.\n1. **Determine Beatrice's Time and Speed:**\n   - Beatrice takes $25$ seconds to complete $100$ meters. \n   - Her speed can be calculated using the formula:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}} = \\frac{100 \\text{ meters}}{25 \\text{ seconds}} = 4 \\text{ meters per second}\n     \\]\n2. **Determine Alice's Time:**\n   - Alice finishes $5$ seconds before Beatrice. Therefore:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Alice's Time} = \\text{Beatrice's Time} - 5 \\text{ seconds} = 25 \\text{ seconds} - 5 \\text{ seconds} = 20 \\text{ seconds}\n     \\]\n3. **Calculate Alice's Speed:**\n   - Now that we know Alice took $20$ seconds to complete $100$ meters, her speed is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Speed} = \\frac{100 \\text{ meters}}{20 \\text{ seconds}} = 5 \\text{ meters per second}\n     \\]\n4. **Find the Time for Alice to Run $50$ Meters:**\n   - To find out how long it takes Alice to run $50$ meters, we use the formula:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}}\n     \\]\n   - Plugging in the distance ($50$ meters) and Alice's speed ($5$ meters per second):\n     \\[\n     \\text{Time} = \\frac{50 \\text{ meters}}{5 \\text{ meters per second}} = 10 \\text{ seconds}\n     \\]\nThus, the time it would take Alice to run $50$ meters is \\(\\boxed{10}\\) seconds.",
