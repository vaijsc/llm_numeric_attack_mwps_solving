    "solution": "Since the geometric sequence is strictly decreasing, the common ratio $m/7$ must be a positive number between 0 or 1. For, if it were greater than 1, the sequence would keep increasing, since the first term is positive. If the ratio was 0, then the sequence would consist of 0's after the first term and would not be strictly decreasing. Finally, if the ratio was negative, the sequence would alternate between positive and negative terms, and thus would not be decreasing. So we have $0 < \\frac{m}{7} < 1$, or $0 < m < 7$. There are $\\boxed{6}$ possible integer values of $m$: 1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.",

        "In a geometric sequence, each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a common ratio \\( r \\). For this particular sequence, the terms are given by:\n1.

Fourth term: \\( ar^3 \\)\n5. ...\nIn our case, the first term \\( a \\) is positive and each successive term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by \\( \\frac{m}{7} \\). Thus, the common ratio \\( r \\) is:\n\\[\nr = \\frac{m}{7}\n\\]\nSince the terms are strictly decreasing, we must ensure that each term is greater than the next term, which translates mathematically to:\n\\[\nar > ar^2 > ar^3 > \\ldots\n\\]\nThis can be simplified to:\n1. \\( ar > ar^2 \\)\n   \n   Dividing both sides by \\( a \\) (positive) gives:\n   \n   \\[\n   r > r^2\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\( r = \\frac{m}{7} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{m}{7} > \\left(\\frac{m}{7}\\right)^2\n   \\]\n2.
