    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Painting three times as many houses in the same amount of time requires three times as many workers.  If the job is to be done in half the time, then the number of workers required is multiplied by an additional factor of 2.  Therefore, 6 times as many workers are needed to paint 12 houses in 3 days as it takes to paint 4 houses in 6 days.  Since the latter task takes 5 workers, the former task takes $\\boxed{30}$ workers.",

        "To find out how many workers are needed to paint 12 houses in three days, we can follow these steps:\n1. **Determine the rate of work in terms of houses per day**:\n   - Five workers paint four houses in six days. \n   - The total worker-days needed to paint four houses is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total worker-days} = \\text{number of workers} \\times \\text{number of days} = 5 \\times 6 = 30 \\text{ worker-days}\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the rate of work is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Rate of work} = \\frac{\\text{4 houses}}{\\text{30 worker-days}} = \\frac{2}{15} \\text{ houses per worker-day}\n     \\]\n2. **Calculate the total worker-days required to paint 12 houses**:\n   - We need to find the total worker-days needed to paint 12 houses.\n   - Using the established rate, we find:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total worker-days needed} = \\frac{\\text{12 houses}}{\\frac{2}{15} \\text{ houses per worker-day}} = 12 \\times \\frac{15}{2} = 90 \\text{ worker-days}\n     \\]\n3. **Determine how many workers are needed to complete the work in three days**:\n   - We know we need 90 worker-days and we want this work completed in three days.\n   - Let \\( W \\) be the number of workers needed. Thus, we have:\n     \\[\n     W \\times 3 \\text{ days} = 90 \\text{ worker-days}\n     \\]\n   - Solving for \\( W \\):\n     \\[\n     W = \\frac{90 \\text{ worker-days}}{3 \\text{ days}} = 30 \\text{ workers}\n     \\]\nTherefore, **30 workers** are needed to paint 12 houses in three days.",
        "To find out how many workers are needed to paint 12 houses in three days, we will first determine the total work done in terms of \"house-days.\"\n1. **Calculate Total Work for Original Scenario:**\n   - Five workers paint four houses in six days.\n   - The total work done by the five workers can be calculated in \"house-days.\" \n   - Total house-days of work = Number of houses \u00d7 Number of days = 4 houses \u00d7 6 days = 24 house-days.\n2. **Calculate Work Per Worker:**\n   - Since five workers complete 24 house-days of work, the work done by one worker in those six days is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Work per worker} = \\frac{24 \\text{ house-days}}{5 \\text{ workers}} = 4.8 \\text{ house-days per worker}\n   \\]\n   This means each worker can paint 4.8 houses in six days.\n3. **Calculate Work Per Day:**\n   - Next, we find how many houses one worker can paint in one day:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Houses per worker per day} = \\frac{4.8 \\text{ houses}}{6 \\text{ days}} = 0.8 \\text{ houses per worker per day}\n   \\]\n4. **Calculate Total Work Needed for New Scenario:**\n   - Now we need to figure out the total work required to paint 12 houses in three days:\n   - Total work in house-days = Number of houses \u00d7 Number of days = 12 houses \u00d7 3 days = 36 house-days.\n5. **Calculate Number of Workers Needed:**\n   - Now, we find how many workers are needed to complete 36 house-days of work at the rate we've calculated for one worker:\n   - If one worker does 0.8 houses per day, the total number of house-days one worker works in three days is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{House-days per worker in 3 days} = 0.8 \\text{ houses/worker/day} \\times 3 \\text{ days} = 2.4 \\text{ houses/worker}\n   \\]\n  \n6. **Final Calculation of Workers Required:**\n   - Total number of workers needed to complete 36 house-days of work can be calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of workers} = \\frac{\\text{Total house-days needed}}{\\text{House-days per worker}} = \\frac{36 \\text{ house-days}}{2.4 \\text{ houses/worker}} = 15 \\text{ workers}\n   \\]\nThus, **15 workers** are needed to paint 12 houses in three days.",
        "To determine how many workers are needed to paint 12 houses in three days, we can start with the information provided and break it down step by step.\n1. **Determine the work done by the original group:**\n   - We know that 5 workers can paint 4 houses in 6 days.\n2. **Calculate the total amount of work in \"worker-days\":**\n   - The total work done can be expressed in worker-days. \n   - If 5 workers work for 6 days, the total work done is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Work} = \\text{Number of Workers} \\times \\text{Number of Days} = 5 \\text{ workers} \\times 6 \\text{ days} = 30 \\text{ worker-days}\n     \\]\n3. **Calculate the work required for 1 house:**\n   - Since 30 worker-days are used to paint 4 houses, the work required to paint 1 house is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Work per House} = \\frac{\\text{Total Work}}{\\text{Number of Houses}} = \\frac{30 \\text{ worker-days}}{4 \\text{ houses}} = 7.5 \\text{ worker-days per house}\n     \\]\n4. **Calculate the work needed to paint 12 houses:**\n   - Now, to find out how much work is needed to paint 12 houses, we multiply the work required for one house by the number of houses:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Work for 12 Houses} = 12 \\text{ houses} \\times 7.5 \\text{ worker-days per house} = 90 \\text{ worker-days}\n     \\]\n5. **Determine how many workers are needed to complete this work in 3 days:**\n   - Finally, we want to find out how many workers are needed to complete 90 worker-days of work in 3 days:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Number of Workers} = \\frac{\\text{Total Work}}{\\text{Number of Days}} = \\frac{90 \\text{ worker-days}}{3 \\text{ days}} = 30 \\text{ workers}\n     \\]\nTherefore, **30 workers are needed to paint 12 houses in 3 days.**",
