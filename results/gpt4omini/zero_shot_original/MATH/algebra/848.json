    "problem": "Two identical blue boxes together weigh the same as three identical red boxes together. Each red box weighs 15.2 ounces. How much does one blue box weigh in ounces?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since one red box weighs 15.2 ounces, three red boxes weigh 45.6 ounces.  This is the same as two blue boxes, so  we have the equation $2b=45.6$ where $b$ represents the weight of the blue box. Solving the equation by multiplying both sides by $\\frac{1}{2}$ to isolate $b$ gives us $b=\\boxed{22.8}$ ounces.",

        "To find the weight of one blue box, we can start by defining variables for the weights of the boxes.\n1. Let \\( b \\) be the weight of one blue box in ounces.\n2. The weight of one red box is given as 15.2 ounces.\nAccording to the problem, we know that two blue boxes weigh the same as three red boxes. We can express this relationship mathematically:\n\\[\n2b = 3 \\times 15.2\n\\]\nNext, we calculate \\( 3 \\times 15.2 \\):\n\\[\n3 \\times 15.2 = 45.6\n\\]\nNow we can write the equation:\n\\[\n2b = 45.6\n\\]\nTo find \\( b \\), we will solve for it by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:\n\\[\nb = \\frac{45.6}{2} = 22.8\n\\]\nThus, the weight of one blue box is \n\\[\n\\boxed{22.8} \\text{ ounces}.\n\\]",
        "Let's denote the weight of one blue box as \\( B \\) ounces and the weight of one red box as \\( R \\) ounces. According to the problem:\n1. **Equation from the weight of blue and red boxes**:\n   \\[\n   2B = 3R\n   \\]\n2. **Weight of one red box**:\n   We know from the problem that the weight of one red box is given as:\n   \\[\n   R = 15.2 \\text{ ounces}\n   \\]\n3. **Substituting \\( R \\) into the equation**:\n   We can now substitute the value of \\( R \\) into the equation:\n   \\[\n   2B = 3 \\times 15.2\n   \\]\n4. **Calculating \\( 3 \\times 15.2 \\)**:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 15.2 = 45.6 \\text{ ounces}\n   \\]\n5. **Updating the equation**:\n   Now we have:\n   \\[\n   2B = 45.6\n   \\]\n6. **Solving for \\( B \\)**:\n   To find the weight of one blue box, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:\n   \\[\n   B = \\frac{45.6}{2} = 22.8 \\text{ ounces}\n   \\]\nThus, the weight of one blue box is \\( \\boxed{22.8} \\) ounces.",
        "Let's denote the weight of one blue box as \\( b \\) ounces and the weight of one red box as \\( r \\) ounces. According to the problem, we know that:\n1. Each red box weighs \\( r = 15.2 \\) ounces.\n2. The weight of two blue boxes is equal to the weight of three red boxes.\nWe can express these relationships mathematically:\n\\[\n2b = 3r\n\\]\nNow, we can substitute the weight of the red box into the equation:\n\\[\n2b = 3(15.2)\n\\]\nCalculating \\( 3 \\times 15.2 \\):\n\\[\n3 \\times 15.2 = 45.6\n\\]\nNow the equation becomes:\n\\[\n2b = 45.6\n\\]\nTo find the weight of one blue box, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:\n\\[\nb = \\frac{45.6}{2}\n\\]\nCalculating \\( \\frac{45.6}{2} \\):\n\\[\nb = 22.8\n\\]\nTherefore, the weight of one blue box is \\( \\boxed{22.8} \\) ounces.",
        "Let's denote the weight of one blue box as \\( b \\) ounces and the weight of one red box as \\( r \\) ounces.\nAccording to the information given:\n1.
