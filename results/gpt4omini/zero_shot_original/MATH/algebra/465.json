    "solution": "Let $d$ be the common difference.  We told that the first term is equal to the third term minus the second term, so the first term is equal to $d$.  Then the second term is equal to $2d$, the third term is equal to $3d$, and the fourth term is equal to $4d = 8$.  Hence, the first term is $d = \\boxed{2}$.",

        "Let\u2019s denote the first term of the arithmetic sequence as \\( a \\) and the common difference as \\( d \\).\nIn an arithmetic sequence, the terms can be expressed as follows:\n- First term: \\( a \\)\n- Second term: \\( a + d \\)\n- Third term: \\( a + 2d \\)\n- Fourth term: \\( a + 3d \\)\nAccording to the problem statement, we are given two conditions:\n1. The first term equals the third term minus the second term:\n   \\[\n   a = (a + 2d) - (a + d)\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this:\n   \\[\n   a = a + 2d - a - d\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   a = d\n   \\]\n2. The fourth term is given to be \\( 8 \\):\n   \\[\n   a + 3d = 8\n   \\]\nSince we know that \\( d = a \\) from the first condition, we can substitute \\( d \\) in the second equation:\n\\[\na + 3a = 8\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n4a = 8\n\\]\nNow, dividing both sides by \\( 4 \\):\n\\[\na = 2\n\\]\nThus, the first term of the arithmetic sequence is\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}.\n\\]",
