        "The equation we need to solve is \n\\[\n|x + y - 7| + |4x - y + 12| = 0.\n\\]\nSince both terms in the equation are absolute values, and the sum of two absolute values is equal to zero, both individual absolute values must also be zero. This gives us two equations to solve:\n1. \\( |x + y - 7| = 0 \\)\n2. \\( |4x - y + 12| = 0 \\)\nWe can start by solving the first equation:\n\\[\n|x + y - 7| = 0 \\implies x + y - 7 = 0 \\implies x + y = 7.\n\\]\nNext, we solve the second equation:\n\\[\n|4x - y + 12| = 0 \\implies 4x - y + 12 = 0 \\implies 4x - y = -12 \\implies y = 4x + 12.\n\\]\nNow, we have a system of two equations:\n1. \\( x + y = 7 \\)\n2. \\( y = 4x + 12 \\)\nWe can substitute the expression for \\( y \\) from the second equation into the first equation:\n\\[\nx + (4x + 12) = 7.\n\\]\nSimplifying this we get:\n\\[\n5x + 12 = 7.\n\\]\nNow, we isolate \\( x \\) by subtracting 12 from both sides:\n\\[\n5x = 7 - 12 \\implies 5x = -5 \\implies x = -1.\n\\]\nNow that we have found \\( x \\), we can substitute it back into one of the equations to find \\( y \\). We can use the first equation:\n\\[\nx + y = 7 \\implies -1 + y = 7 \\implies y = 7 + 1 \\implies y = 8.\n\\]\nThus, we have the ordered pair:\n\\[\n(x, y) = (-1, 8).\n\\]\nFinally, we should verify that this pair satisfies both original equations. \n1. Checking \\( |x + y - 7| \\):\n\\[\n|-1 + 8 - 7| = |0| = 0.\n\\]\n2. Checking \\( |4x - y + 12| \\):\n\\[\n|4(-1) - 8 + 12| = |-4 - 8 + 12| = |0| = 0.\n\\]\nBoth conditions are satisfied, confirming that the solution is correct. Thus, the final answer is \n\\[\n\\boxed{(-1, 8)}.\n\\]",
