    "solution": "With word problems, the first step is to translate the words into equations. Let the two numbers be $a$ and $b$. Then their sum is $a+b$ and their product is $ab$. The sum of their product and their sum is $a+b+ab$. So we know  \\begin{align*}\nab+a+b&=454\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\na(b+1)+(b+1)&=454+1\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n(a+1)(b+1)&=455.\n\\end{align*}The prime factorization of $455$ is $5\\cdot 7\\cdot 13$. Since the equation is symmetric with $a$ and $b$, we may (without loss of generality) suppose that $a<b$. Thus $a+1<b+1$, so in each factor pair the smaller factor is equal to $a+1$. We list all possibilities: \\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c}\n$a+1$&$b+1$&$a$&$b$\\\\ \\hline\n$1$&$455$&$0$&$454$\\\\\n$5$&$91$&$4$&$90$\\\\\n$7$&$65$&$6$&$64$\\\\\n$13$&$35$&$12$&$34$\n\\end{tabular}We must find the largest possible value of \"the product of their sum and their product\", or $ab\\cdot(a+b)$. We know the first possibility above gives a value of zero, while all the others will be greater than zero. We check: \\begin{align*}\n4\\cdot 90\\cdot (4+90)&=4\\cdot 90\\cdot 94=33840\\\\\n6\\cdot 64\\cdot (6+64)&=6\\cdot 64\\cdot 70=26880\\\\\n12\\cdot 34\\cdot (12+34)&=12\\cdot 34\\cdot 46=18768.\n\\end{align*}Thus the largest possible desired value is $\\boxed{33840}$, achieved when $(a,b)=(4,90)$.",

        "Let the two positive integers be \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). We are given that:\n\\[\nxy + (x + y) = 454.\n\\]\nRearranging the equation:\n\\[\nxy + x + y = 454.\n\\]\nNext, we can define \\( s = x + y \\) (the sum of the integers) and \\( p = xy \\) (the product of the integers). Then we can rewrite the equation as:\n\\[\np + s = 454.\n\\]\nWe want to find the largest possible value of the product \\( s \\cdot p \\). Substituting \\( p \\) with \\( 454 - s \\), we get:\n\\[\ns \\cdot p = s(454 - s) = 454s - s^2.\n\\]\nThe expression \\( 454s - s^2 \\) is a quadratic function in terms of \\( s \\) and opens downwards (since the coefficient of \\( s^2 \\) is negative). To find the maximum value, we need the vertex of this quadratic. The vertex \\( s \\) can be found using the formula \\( s = -\\frac{b}{2a} \\), where \\( a = -1 \\) and \\( b = 454 \\):\n\\[\ns = -\\frac{454}{2 \\cdot -1} = \\frac{454}{2} = 227.\n\\]\nNow we substitute \\( s = 227 \\) to find \\( p \\):\n\\[\np = 454 - s = 454 - 227 = 227.\n\\]\nWe now have \\( s = 227 \\) and \\( p = 227 \\).\nNext, we compute \\( s \\cdot p \\):\n\\[\ns \\cdot p = 227 \\cdot 227 = 227^2.\n\\]\nCalculating \\( 227^2 \\):\n\\[\n227^2 = 51529.\n\\]\nNow we need to ensure that \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) can indeed be \\( 227 \\) under the conditions of being positive integers. The quadratic for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) (considering \\( x + y = 227 \\) and \\( xy = 227 \\)) becomes:\n\\[\nt^2 - st + p = 0 \\implies t^2 - 227t + 227 = 0.\n\\]\nNext, we calculate the discriminant:\n\\[\nD = b^2 - 4ac = 227^2 - 4 \\cdot 227 = 51529 - 908 = 50621.\n\\]\nThis discriminant must be a perfect square for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) to be integers. The square root of \\( 50621 \\):\n\\[\n\\sqrt{50621} = 225.\n\\]\nSince \\( 225^2 = 50625 \\), and since \\( 225 \\) is an integer, the solution (for roots) computes as:\n\\[\nx, y = \\frac{227 \\pm 225}{2} \\implies \\frac{452}{2} = 226 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{2}{2} = 1.\n\\]\nThus, the two integers are \\( x = 226 \\) and \\( y = 1 \\) (or vice versa). \nFinally, the maximum required product \\( s \\cdot p \\):\n\\[\n\\boxed{51529}.\n\\]",

Thus, we rewrite the equation as:\n\\[\np + s = 454 \\quad \\implies \\quad p = 454 - s\n\\]\nWe are interested in maximizing the value of the product of the sum and the product, which is:\n\\[\ns \\cdot p = s(454 - s)\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\ns(454 - s) = 454s - s^2\n\\]\nThis is a quadratic function in \\( s \\):\n\\[\nf(s) = -s^2 + 454s\n\\]\nSince it is a downward-facing parabola, the maximum value occurs at the vertex. The vertex of a quadratic \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\) occurs at:\n\\[\ns = -\\frac{b}{2a} = -\\frac{454}{2 \\cdot (-1)} = \\frac{454}{2} = 227\n\\]\nNow, we substitute this value back into the equation for \\( p \\):\n\\[\np = 454 - s = 454 - 227 = 227\n\\]\nNow we compute the product of the sum and the product:\n\\[\ns \\cdot p = 227 \\cdot 227 = 227^2\n\\]\nCalculating \\( 227^2 \\):\n\\[\n227^2 = 51329\n\\]\nNow, we verify that there are integers \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) that satisfy \\( x + y = 227 \\) and \\( xy = 227 \\).

Since \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) must be positive integers, we validate this further.\nThus, we conclude that the maximum value of the product of the sum and the product is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{51329}\n\\]",
