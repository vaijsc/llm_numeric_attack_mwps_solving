    "solution": "If Lara read $P$ pages on the first day, then she read $P/2$ pages the second day, $P/4$ pages on the third day, $P/8$ pages on the fourth day, and $P/16$ pages on the fifth day.  In total, she read  \\[\nP+\\frac{P}{2}+\\frac{P}{4}+\\frac{P}{8}+\\frac{P}{16}=\\frac{31}{16}P\n\\] pages. Setting this equal to 248, we find that Lara read $P=\\frac{16}{31}\\cdot248=\\boxed{128}$ pages.",

        "To find out how many pages Lara read on the first day, we need to set up an equation based on the information given.\nLet \\( x \\) be the number of pages Lara read on the first day. According to the information provided, the number of pages she read each subsequent day is half of the previous day's pages. Hence, the number of pages read over five days can be expressed as follows:\n- Day 1: \\( x \\)\n- Day 2: \\( \\frac{x}{2} \\)\n- Day 3: \\( \\frac{x}{4} \\)\n- Day 4: \\( \\frac{x}{8} \\)\n- Day 5: \\( \\frac{x}{16} \\)\nNow we can write an equation for the total number of pages read over the five days:\n\\[\nx + \\frac{x}{2} + \\frac{x}{4} + \\frac{x}{8} + \\frac{x}{16} = 248\n\\]\nTo simplify this equation, let's find a common denominator, which in this case is 16:\n\\[\nx + \\frac{8x}{16} + \\frac{4x}{16} + \\frac{2x}{16} + \\frac{x}{16}\n\\]\nNow we can combine these fractions:\n\\[\nx + \\frac{8x + 4x + 2x + x}{16} = 248\n\\]\n\\[\nx + \\frac{15x}{16} = 248\n\\]\nNext, let's convert \\( x \\) into a fraction with the same denominator:\n\\[\n\\frac{16x}{16} + \\frac{15x}{16} = 248\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{31x}{16} = 248\n\\]\nTo eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by 16:\n\\[\n31x = 248 \\times 16\n\\]\n\\[\n31x = 3968\n\\]\nNow, divide both sides by 31 to solve for \\( x \\):\n\\[\nx = \\frac{3968}{31}\n\\]\n\\[\nx = 128\n\\]\nThus, the number of pages Lara read on the first day is \\( \\boxed{128} \\).\nTo verify, we can calculate the number of pages she read each day:\n- Day 1: 128 pages\n- Day 2: \\( \\frac{128}{2} = 64 \\) pages\n- Day 3: \\( \\frac{64}{2} = 32 \\) pages\n- Day 4: \\( \\frac{32}{2} = 16 \\) pages\n- Day 5: \\( \\frac{16}{2} = 8 \\) pages\nNow, summing those up:\n\\[\n128 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 = 248\n\\]\nThis confirms our solution is correct.

The least common multiple of 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 is 16.
