    "problem": "My usual workout consists of running 10 laps around a 400 meter track. If I go to a track that is only 250 meters long, how many laps will I need to run to get the same workout?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since the total distance that I run is constant, the length of each lap and the total number of laps are inversely proportional. Consequently, if each lap is $\\frac{250}{400}=\\frac{5}{8}$ as long, I need to run $\\frac{8}{5}$ as many laps, so our answer is $\\frac{8}{5}\\cdot10=\\boxed{16}$ laps.",

        "To find out how many laps you need to run on a 250-meter track to match the distance of running 10 laps around a 400-meter track, we can follow these steps:\n1. **Calculate the total distance for the usual workout:**\n   - The track is 400 meters long and you run 10 laps.\n   - Total distance = Number of laps \u00d7 Length of the track\n   - Total distance = 10 laps \u00d7 400 meters/lap = 4000 meters\n2. **Calculate the number of laps needed on the 250-meter track to cover the same distance:**\n   - Let the number of laps needed on the 250-meter track be denoted as \\(L\\).\n   - Total distance = Number of laps \u00d7 Length of the track\n   - We want to find \\(L\\) such that:\n   - \\(L \\times 250 \\text{ meters/lap} = 4000 \\text{ meters}\\)\n3. **Solve for \\(L\\):**\n   - \\(L = \\frac{4000 \\text{ meters}}{250 \\text{ meters/lap}} = 16\\)\nSo, to get the same workout on a 250-meter track, you will need to run **16 laps**.",
        "To determine how many laps you need to run on a 250-meter track to equal the distance of running 10 laps on a 400-meter track, we can follow these steps:\n1. **Calculate the total distance run on the 400-meter track:**\n   - Each lap on the 400-meter track is 400 meters.\n   - If you run 10 laps: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Total distance} = 10 \\text{ laps} \\times 400 \\text{ meters/lap} = 4000 \\text{ meters}\n     \\]\n2. **Determine how many laps you need to run on the 250-meter track to equal the same total distance:**\n   - Each lap on the 250-meter track is 250 meters.\n   - To find the number of laps (\\( x \\)) needed on the 250-meter track to cover 4000 meters, we set up the equation:\n     \\[\n     x \\text{ laps} \\times 250 \\text{ meters/lap} = 4000 \\text{ meters}\n     \\]\n   - Solving for \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{4000 \\text{ meters}}{250 \\text{ meters/lap}} = 16\n     \\]\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - You will need to run **16 laps** on a 250-meter track to match the same total distance of running 10 laps on a 400-meter track.",

        "To determine how many laps you need to run on a 250-meter track to match the distance you normally run on a 400-meter track, we can follow these steps:\n1. **Calculate the total distance of your usual workout on the 400-meter track**:\n   - You run 10 laps, and each lap is 400 meters.\n   - Total distance on the 400-meter track = 10 laps \u00d7 400 meters/lap = 4000 meters.\n2. **Determine the distance you need to cover on the 250-meter track**:\n   - You want to cover the same total distance: 4000 meters.\n3. **Calculate how many laps you need to run on the 250-meter track**:\n   - Each lap on the 250-meter track is 250 meters.\n   - To find the number of laps, divide the total distance you want to cover by the length of the 250-meter track:\n   - Number of laps = Total distance / Length of one lap = 4000 meters / 250 meters/lap.\n4. **Perform the calculation**:\n   - Number of laps = 4000 / 250 = 16 laps.\nTherefore, to get the same workout, you will need to run **16 laps** around the 250-meter track.",
