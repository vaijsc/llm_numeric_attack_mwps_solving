        "Let's denote the two numbers as \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n1. We know from the problem that:\n   - The sum of the two numbers is 25:\n     \\[\n     x + y = 25 \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)}\n     \\]\n   - The difference of the two numbers is 11:\n     \\[\n     x - y = 11 \\quad \\text{(Equation 2)}\n     \\]\n2.
