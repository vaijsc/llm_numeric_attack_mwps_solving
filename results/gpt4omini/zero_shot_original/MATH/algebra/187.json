    "solution": "Let the three basset hounds weigh $a$, $a$, and $b$ pounds, where $a < b$. We have the two equations \\begin{align*}\n2a+b&=185\\\\\nb-a&=20\n\\end{align*} From the second equation, we have $a=b-20$. Substituting this in to the first equation to eliminate $a$, we have $2(b-20)+b=185 \\Rightarrow b=75$. Thus, the largest dog weighs $\\boxed{75}$ pounds.",

        "To solve the problem, we can define the weights of the three basset hounds using variables. Let's denote:\n- The weight of each of the two smaller dogs as \\( x \\).\n- The weight of the larger dog as \\( y \\).\nWe know from the problem statement:\n1. The combined weight of all three dogs is 185 pounds:\n   \\[\n   x + x + y = 185\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this gives us:\n   \\[\n   2x + y = 185\n   \\]\n2. The difference in weight between the larger dog and one smaller dog is 20 pounds:\n   \\[\n   y - x = 20\n   \\]\nNow we have a system of equations:\n1. \\( 2x + y = 185 \\)  (Equation 1)\n2. \\( y - x = 20 \\)    (Equation 2)\nWe can solve these equations step-by-step.\n### Step 1: Solve Equation 2 for \\( y \\)\nFrom Equation 2:\n\\[\ny = x + 20\n\\]\n### Step 2: Substitute \\( y \\) into Equation 1\nNow we substitute \\( y \\) in Equation 1:\n\\[\n2x + (x + 20) = 185\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n2x + x + 20 = 185\n\\]\n\\[\n3x + 20 = 185\n\\]\n### Step 3: Solve for \\( x \\)\nSubtract 20 from both sides:\n\\[\n3x = 165\n\\]\nNow divide both sides by 3:\n\\[\nx = 55\n\\]\n### Step 4: Find \\( y \\)\nNow, substitute \\( x \\) back into the equation for \\( y \\):\n\\[\ny = x + 20 = 55 + 20 = 75\n\\]\n### Conclusion\nThus, the weight of the largest dog is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{75}\n\\]\n### Verification\nLet's verify our solution to ensure it meets all conditions:\n- The weights of the two smaller dogs are \\( 55 \\) pounds each.\n- The weight of the larger dog is \\( 75 \\) pounds.\n- The total weight is: \n  \\[\n  55 + 55 + 75 = 185 \\text{ pounds (correct)}\n  \\]\n- The difference between the larger dog and the smaller dog is: \n  \\[\n  75 - 55 = 20 \\text{ pounds (correct)}\n  \\]\nAll conditions match, confirming that the largest dog weighs \\( \\boxed{75} \\) pounds.",
