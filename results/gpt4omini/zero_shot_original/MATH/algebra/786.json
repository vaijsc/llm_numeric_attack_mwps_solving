        "To determine how many degrees the Earth rotates in one hour, we start with the information that the Earth completes one full rotation of 360 degrees in 24 hours (which is the length of one day).\n1. **Total degrees in one full rotation**: 360 degrees\n2. **Total hours in one day**: 24 hours\nNext, to find out how many degrees the Earth rotates in one hour, we can divide the total degrees by the total hours:\n\\[\n\\text{Degrees per hour} = \\frac{360 \\text{ degrees}}{24 \\text{ hours}} \n\\]\nNow, we perform the division:\n\\[\n\\text{Degrees per hour} = 15 \\text{ degrees per hour}\n\\]\nThus, the Earth rotates **15 degrees in one hour**.",
        "To find out how many degrees the Earth rotates in one hour, we can follow these steps:\n1. **Understand the total degrees in one complete rotation**: The Earth completes one full rotation which is 360 degrees in one day.\n2. **Determine how many hours are in a day**: There are 24 hours in a day.\n3. **Calculate the degrees rotated per hour**: We can divide the total degrees by the total hours.\n\\[\n\\text{Degrees per hour} = \\frac{\\text{Total degrees}}{\\text{Total hours}} = \\frac{360 \\text{ degrees}}{24 \\text{ hours}}\n\\]\n4. **Perform the calculation**:\n\\[\n\\frac{360}{24} = 15 \\text{ degrees per hour}\n\\]\nSo, the Earth rotates **15 degrees in one hour**.",
