    "solution": "The cost increased by a factor of 2 due to the increase in cost per person and by an additional factor of 2 due to the increase in number of people.  In total, the cost increased by a factor of 4, so the ratio of the cost of the party in 2007 to the cost of the party in 2008 is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$.",

        "To find the total cost of Kyle's birthday party in both 2007 and 2008, we'll start by calculating the total costs for each year based on the given variables.\n1. **Total Cost in 2007**:\n   - Cost per person = \\(d\\) dollars\n   - Number of people = \\(p\\)\n   - Therefore, the total cost in 2007 is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Cost}_{2007} = d \\times p = dp\n     \\]\n2. **Total Cost in 2008**:\n   - In 2008, the cost per person doubles, so the new cost per person is \\(2d\\).\n   - The number of people attending also doubles, so the new number of people is \\(2p\\).\n   - Therefore, the total cost in 2008 is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Cost}_{2008} = (2d) \\times (2p) = 4dp\n     \\]\n3. **Ratio of Total Costs**:\n   - Now we need to find the ratio of the total cost in 2007 to the total cost in 2008:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Cost}_{2007}}{\\text{Total Cost}_{2008}} = \\frac{dp}{4dp}\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying this expression, we can cancel out \\(dp\\) (as long as \\(dp \\neq 0\\)):\n     \\[\n     \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{1}{4}\n     \\]\nThus, the ratio of the total cost of the party in 2007 to the total cost of the party in 2008 is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}\n\\]",
