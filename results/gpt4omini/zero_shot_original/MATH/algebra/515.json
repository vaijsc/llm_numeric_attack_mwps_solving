    "solution": "We know one point on the line: the camera is at $(0,10)$. To find another point on the line we can determine where Tina was when she noticed her camera was missing. She travels a total of $10+8+6+4+2$ units north from the origin, so her ending $y$-coordinate is $30$. She travels $9+7+5+3+1$ units east, so her ending $x$-coordinate is $25$. So we must find the equation of the line through $(0,10)$ and $(25,30)$. The slope of the line is $\\frac{30-10}{25-0}=\\frac{20}{25}=\\frac{4}{5}$. We can use point-slope form to find that the equation of the line is $(y-10)=\\frac{4}{5}(x-0)$, or $5(y-10)=4x$. Simplifying this gives $5y-50=4x$, so in the form requested, $\\boxed{4x-5y=-50}$.",

        "To find the equation of the line that Tina drives back to her camera, we first need to track her movements step by step.\n1. **Initial Position**: Start at the origin \\((0, 0)\\).\n2. **First Move**: Move north \\(10\\) units to \\((0, 10)\\).\n3. **Second Move**: Turn east and drive \\(9\\) units to \\((9, 10)\\).\n4. **Third Move**: Turn north and drive \\(8\\) units to \\((9, 18)\\).\n5. **Fourth Move**: Turn east and drive \\(7\\) units to \\((16, 18)\\).\n6. **Fifth Move**: Turn north and drive \\(6\\) units to \\((16, 24)\\).\n7. **Sixth Move**: Turn east and drive \\(5\\) units to \\((21, 24)\\).\n8. **Seventh Move**: Turn north and drive \\(4\\) units to \\((21, 28)\\).\n9. **Eighth Move**: Turn east and drive \\(3\\) units to \\((24, 28)\\).\n10. **Ninth Move**: Turn north and drive \\(2\\) units to \\((24, 30)\\).\n11. **Tenth Move**: Turn east and drive \\(1\\) unit to \\((25, 30)\\).\nAfter these moves, her final position is \\((25, 30)\\), and the camera is at \\((0, 10)\\).\nNext, we calculate the slope of the line between these two points \\((25, 30)\\) and \\((0, 10)\\):\n1. **Slope Calculation (m)**:\n   \\[\n   m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \\frac{10 - 30}{0 - 25} = \\frac{-20}{-25} = \\frac{4}{5}\n   \\]\n2. **Point-Slope Form of the Line**: Using the point-slope form, \\(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\\):\n   \\[\n   y - 30 = \\frac{4}{5}(x - 25)\n   \\]\n   Expanding this:\n   \\[\n   y - 30 = \\frac{4}{5}x - 20\n   \\]\n   Rearranging gives:\n   \\[\n   y = \\frac{4}{5}x + 10\n   \\]\n3. **Convert to Standard Form**: We want to express this in the form \\(ax + by = c\\).
