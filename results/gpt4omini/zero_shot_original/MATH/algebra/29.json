We know that $\\alpha\\beta = 48$, and $\\alpha/\\beta = 3 \\implies \\alpha = 3\\beta$.\n\nSo $ b = -\\alpha - \\beta = -4\\beta$. To maximize $b$, we want to make $\\beta$ negative and as large as possible. Given the relationship that $\\alpha = 3\\beta$ and that $\\alpha*\\beta = 48$, we see that $\\beta = 4$ or $-4$. Clearly $-4$ maximizes $b$, and $b = \\boxed{16}$.",

        "To solve the problem, we start by letting the two roots of the quadratic equation \\( x^2 + bx + 48 = 0 \\) be in the ratio 3:1. We can express the roots as \\( 3k \\) and \\( k \\), where \\( k \\) is a positive constant.\nAccording to Vieta's formulas, for a quadratic equation of the form \\( x^2 + bx + c = 0 \\):\n- The sum of the roots \\( r_1 + r_2 = -b \\)\n- The product of the roots \\( r_1 r_2 = c \\)\nIn our case, the roots are \\( 3k \\) and \\( k \\), and \\( c = 48 \\). Therefore:\n1. Sum of the roots:\n   \\[\n   3k + k = 4k = -b \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad b = -4k\n   \\]\n2. Product of the roots:\n   \\[\n   (3k)(k) = 3k^2 = 48 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad k^2 = \\frac{48}{3} = 16 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad k = 4\n   \\]\nNow, substituting the value of \\( k \\) back into the expression we found for \\( b \\):\n\\[\nb = -4k = -4(4) = -16\n\\]\nSo, we have found that one possible value of \\( b \\) is \\( -16 \\).\n### Exploring more values of \\( b \\)\nTo check for other potential values of \\( b \\), we can consider the roots in the ratio of 3:1 as:\nLet \\( r_1 = 3x \\) and \\( r_2 = x \\). Then:\n- The sum of the roots gives us:\n  \\[\n  3x + x = 4x = -b \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad b = -4x\n  \\]\n  \n- The product of the roots gives us:\n  \\[\n  (3x)(x) = 3x^2 = 48 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x^2 = \\frac{48}{3} = 16 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = 4 \\text{ or } -4\n  \\]\nIf \\( x = 4 \\):\n\\[\nb = -4(4) = -16\n\\]\nIf \\( x = -4 \\):\n\\[\nb = -4(-4) = 16\n\\]\nThus, we also have \\( b = 16 \\) as another value which corresponds to a case where the ratio of the roots is still respected (as we only take the magnitude of the roots into account).\n### Conclusion\nHence, the largest possible value of \\( b \\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{16}\n\\]",

The ratio of the two solutions is \\( \\frac{3k}{k} = 3 \\).\nUsing Vieta's formulas, we know that for a quadratic equation of the form \\( x^2 + bx + c = 0 \\), the sum of the roots \\( r_1 + r_2 \\) is given by \\( -b \\) and the product of the roots \\( r_1 r_2 \\) is \\( c \\).

        "To find the values of \\( b \\) such that the roots of the equation \\( x^2 + bx + 48 = 0 \\) are in the ratio of 3 to 1, we can denote the roots as \\( 3k \\) and \\( k \\), where \\( k \\) is a positive real number.\nUsing Vieta's formulas, we know that:\n- The sum of the roots \\( (3k + k) = 4k \\) is equal to \\( -b \\).\n- The product of the roots \\( (3k \\cdot k) = 3k^2 \\) is equal to 48.\nFrom the product of the roots:\n\\[\n3k^2 = 48\n\\]\nDividing both sides by 3 gives:\n\\[\nk^2 = 16\n\\]\nTaking the square root of both sides, we find \\( k = 4 \\).
