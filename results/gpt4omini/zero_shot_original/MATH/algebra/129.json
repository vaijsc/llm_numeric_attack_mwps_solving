        "To start, we need to calculate the areas of the modified squares based on the changes to the original squares. \n1. **Calculating the area of Square A:**\n   Square A originally has a side length of \\(2009\\). After increasing its dimensions by \\(x\\), the new side length becomes:\n   \\[\n   2009 + x\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the area of Square A becomes:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of Square A} = (2009 + x)^2\n   \\]\n2. **Calculating the area of Square B:**\n   Square B originally has a side length of \\(2009\\) as well. After decreasing its dimensions by \\(x\\), the new side length becomes:\n   \\[\n   2009 - x\n   \\]\n   Hence, the area of Square B is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of Square B} = (2009 - x)^2\n   \\]\n3. **Finding the difference in area:**\n   The difference in area between Square A and Square B is computed as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Difference} = (2009 + x)^2 - (2009 - x)^2\n   \\]\n   This expression can be simplified using the formula for the difference of squares:\n   \\[\n   a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\n   \\]\n   where \\( a = 2009 + x \\) and \\( b = 2009 - x \\).\n   Substituting gives:\n   \\[\n   a - b = (2009 + x) - (2009 - x) = 2x\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   a + b = (2009 + x) + (2009 - x) = 4018\n   \\]\n   Now, we calculate the difference in area:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Difference} = (2x)(4018) = 8036x\n   \\]\n4. **Setting up the inequality:**\n   We need the difference in area to be at least equal to the area of the original \\(2009 \\times 2009\\) square. The area of the original square is:\n   \\[\n   2009^2 = 4036081\n   \\]\n   Thus, we set up the inequality:\n   \\[\n   8036x \\geq 4036081\n   \\]\n5. **Solving for \\(x\\):**\n   Dividing both sides by \\(8036\\):\n   \\[\n   x \\geq \\frac{4036081}{8036}\n   \\]\n   Calculating the quotient:\n   \\[\n   x \\geq 501.0\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the minimum value of \\(x\\) that satisfies the condition is:\n   \\[\n   x = 501\n   \\]\nThus, the minimum value of \\(x\\) such that the difference in area between the two modified squares is at least as great as the area of the original \\(2009 \\times 2009\\) square is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{501}\n\\]",
        "To find the minimum value of \\( x \\) such that the difference in area between the two new squares is at least as great as the area of a \\( 2009 \\) by \\( 2009 \\) square, we begin by calculating the areas of both squares before and after the change.\n1. **Calculate the area of the original squares:**\n   - The area of Square A (original) is:\n     \\[\n     A_A = 2009 \\times 2009 = 2009^2\n     \\]\n   - The area of Square B (original) is:\n     \\[\n     A_B = 2009 \\times 2009 = 2009^2\n     \\]\n2. **Calculate the area of the squares after the modifications:**\n   - After increasing the dimensions of Square A by \\( x \\), the new area of Square A becomes:\n     \\[\n     A_A' = (2009 + x)(2009 + x) = (2009 + x)^2\n     \\]\n   - After decreasing the dimensions of Square B by \\( x \\), the new area of Square B becomes:\n     \\[\n     A_B' = (2009 - x)(2009 - x) = (2009 - x)^2\n     \\]\n3. **Determine the difference in areas:**\n   - The difference in areas between the two new squares is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Difference} = A_A' - A_B' = (2009 + x)^2 - (2009 - x)^2\n     \\]\n4. **Using the difference of squares formula:**\n   The difference of squares states \\( a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b) \\).
