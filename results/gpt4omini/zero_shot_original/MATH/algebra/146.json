        "To find the cost of one pencil, we can break down the problem step by step.\n1. **Find the cost of one pen**:\n   We know that seven pens cost $9.24. To find the cost of one pen, we can divide the total cost by the number of pens:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of one pen} = \\frac{9.24}{7}\n   \\]\n   Performing the division:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of one pen} = 1.32 \\text{ (in dollars)}\n   \\]\n2. **Find the total cost of three pens**:\n   Since eleven pencils cost as much as three pens, we need the cost of three pens. We simply multiply the cost of one pen by 3:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of three pens} = 3 \\times 1.32 = 3.96 \\text{ (in dollars)}\n   \\]\n3. **Relate the cost to pencils**:\n   We know now that the total cost of three pens is equal to the cost of eleven pencils:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of 11 pencils} = 3.96 \\text{ (in dollars)}\n   \\]\n4. **Find the cost of one pencil**:\n   To find the cost of one pencil, divide the total cost for eleven pencils by 11:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of one pencil} = \\frac{3.96}{11}\n   \\]\n   Performing the division:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of one pencil} \\approx 0.36 \\text{ (in dollars)}\n   \\]\n5. **Convert the cost to cents**:\n   Since we want the cost in cents, we multiply by 100 (as there are 100 cents in a dollar):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of one pencil in cents} = 0.36 \\times 100 = 36\n   \\]\nThus, the cost of one pencil is \\(\\boxed{36}\\) cents.",
        "To find the cost of one pencil in cents, we first need to determine the cost of one pen. Given that seven pens cost \\$9.24, we can calculate the cost of one pen as follows:\n1. **Calculate the cost of one pen**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of one pen} = \\frac{\\text{Total cost of seven pens}}{\\text{Number of pens}} = \\frac{9.24}{7}\n   \\]\n   Performing the division:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of one pen} = 1.32 \\quad \\text{(This means one pen costs \\$1.32)}\n   \\]\n2. **Determine the cost of three pens**:\n   Now that we know the cost of one pen, we can find out how much three pens cost:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of three pens} = 3 \\times \\text{Cost of one pen} = 3 \\times 1.32 = 3.96 \\quad \\text{(This means three pens cost \\$3.96)}\n   \\]\n3. **Relate pencils and pens**:\n   According to the information provided, the cost of eleven pencils is equal to the cost of three pens. Therefore:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of eleven pencils} = 3.96\n   \\]\n4. **Calculate the cost of one pencil**:\n   To find the cost of one pencil, we need to divide the total cost of eleven pencils by eleven:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of one pencil} = \\frac{\\text{Cost of eleven pencils}}{11} = \\frac{3.96}{11}\n   \\]\n   Performing the division:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of one pencil} = 0.36 \\quad \\text{(This means one pencil costs \\$0.36)}\n   \\]\n5. **Convert the cost from dollars to cents**:\n   Since the problem asks for the cost in cents, we need to convert dollars to cents:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost in cents} = 0.36 \\text{ dollars} \\times 100 = 36 \\text{ cents}\n   \\]\nTherefore, the cost of one pencil is \\(\\boxed{36}\\) cents.",
        "To solve the problem, we start by determining the cost of one pen. \nFirst, we know that seven pens cost $9.24.
