        "To find out how many quarts of water will be used for two teaspoons of salt, we can follow these steps:\n1. **Understand the ratio given**: The recipe states that \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) teaspoon of salt is needed for each quart of water. This means for every quart of water, we add \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) teaspoon of salt.\n2. **Convert teaspoons of salt to quarts of water**: We need to determine how many quarts of water can be made with two teaspoons of salt.\n3. **Calculate how many quarts correspond to 2 teaspoons**:\n   - We know that \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) teaspoon is used per quart. Therefore, to find out how many quarts could use 2 teaspoons of salt, we set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of quarts} = \\frac{\\text{Amount of salt in teaspoons}}{\\text{Salt per quart in teaspoons}}\n   \\]\n   - We convert \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) teaspoon to a decimal for ease of calculation: \\(\\frac{1}{4} = 0.25\\) teaspoons.\n   - Thus, the number of quarts that can be made with 2 teaspoons of salt is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of quarts} = \\frac{2 \\text{ teaspoons}}{0.25 \\text{ teaspoons/quart}}\n   \\]\n4. **Perform the division**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of quarts} = 2 \\div 0.25 = 2 \\times 4 = 8\n   \\]\n5. **Final answer**: Therefore, with 2 teaspoons of salt, we can use **8 quarts of water**. \nIn conclusion, if we have \\(\\textbf{8 quarts}\\) of water, it will require 2 teaspoons of salt according to the recipe.",
        "To determine how many quarts of water are needed for two teaspoons of salt based on the recipe, we will follow these steps:\n1. **Identify the ratio of salt to water:**  \n   The recipe specifies that \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) teaspoon of salt is required for each quart of water.\n2. **Calculate the total number of quarts for two teaspoons of salt:**  \n   Since we need to find out how many quarts of water correspond to two teaspoons of salt, we can express the relationship using a formula. \n   Let \\( x \\) be the number of quarts of water. According to the recipe:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{4} \\text{ teaspoon of salt} \\text{ per quart of water} = \\frac{2 \\text{ teaspoons of salt}}{x \\text{ quarts of water}}\n   \\]\n3. **Set up the equation:**\n   We can set this up as a proportion:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\frac{1}{4}}{1} = \\frac{2}{x}\n   \\]\n4. **Cross-multiply:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot x = 2 \\cdot 1\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{4}x = 2\n   \\]\n5. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   To isolate \\( x \\), we can multiply both sides by 4:\n   \\[\n   x = 2 \\times 4\n   \\]\n   Thus,\n   \\[\n   x = 8\n   \\]\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   Therefore, the number of quarts of water that will be used for two teaspoons of salt is \\(\\boxed{8}\\).",
        "To solve the problem step by step, we need to determine how many quarts of water corresponds to two teaspoons of salt based on the given ratio of salt to water.\n1. **Understand the ratio**: The recipe states that for each quart of water, we need \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) teaspoon of salt.\n2. **Find how many quarts correspond to one teaspoon of salt**:\n   - If \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) teaspoon of salt is used per quart, then:\n     \\[\n     1 \\text{ quart of water} \\quad \\text{uses} \\quad \\frac{1}{4} \\text{ teaspoon of salt}\n     \\]\n   - To find out how many quarts correspond to \\(1\\) teaspoon of salt, we set up the equation:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{4} \\text{ teaspoon} \\quad \\text{for} \\quad 1 \\text{ quart} \\implies 1 \\text{ teaspoon} \\quad \\text{for} \\quad 4 \\text{ quarts}\n     \\]\n3. **Now calculate for two teaspoons of salt**:\n   - Since \\(1\\) teaspoon corresponds to \\(4\\) quarts:\n     \\[\n     2 \\text{ teaspoons} \\quad \\text{will correspond to} \\quad 2 \\times 4 = 8 \\text{ quarts}\n     \\]\nSo, the number of quarts of water that will be used for two teaspoons of salt is \\(\\boxed{8}\\).",
        "To determine how many quarts of water will be used for two teaspoons of salt, we can start by understanding the ratio given in the recipe.\n1.

If \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) teaspoon of salt is used for 1 quart of water, then the amount of salt required for \\(x\\) quarts of water can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Salt required} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times x \\text{ teaspoons}\n   \\]\n4. We need this amount to equal the total amount of salt we have, which is 2 teaspoons:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{4} \\times x = 2\n   \\]\n5.
