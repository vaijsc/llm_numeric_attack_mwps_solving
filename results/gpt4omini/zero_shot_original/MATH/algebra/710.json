In particular, if we let $t(x)$ denote the amount of taxes, then $t(x) = 0$ when $0 \\le x \\le 20000$. For $20000 \\le x \\le 45000$, he pays $$t(x) = 0.05 (x-20000).$$For $45000 \\le x \\le 80000$, he pays  \\begin{align*}\nt(x)& = 0.05(45000-20000) + 0.1(x - 45000)\\\\\n& = 1250 + x/10 - 4500.\n\\end{align*}For $80000 \\le x \\le 130000$ he pays  \\begin{align*}\nt(x) &= 1250 + 0.1(80000-45000) + 0.15(x - 80000)\\\\\n& = 4750 + 0.15x - 12000.\n\\end{align*}Finally, if $x \\ge 130000$, he pays  \\begin{align*}t(x) &= 4750 + 0.15(130000-80000) + 0.2(x - 130000)\\\\\n& = 12250 + 0.2(x - 130000).\\end{align*}We can immediately eliminate the last possibility, since then he would automatically pay at least $\\$12,250$ in taxes. If $x \\le 80000$, then $t(x) \\le 1250 + 80000/10 - 4500 = 4750$. Hence, $80000 \\le x \\le 130000$. Then, $$10000 = 4750 + 0.15x - 12000 \\Longrightarrow x = \\boxed{\\$115,000}.$$",

        "To determine Dr. Jones's income based on the taxes he pays, we analyze the tax brackets step by step based on the given tax rates.\n1. **No tax on the first $20,000**:\n   - Tax: $0\n   - Income covered: $20,000\n2. **5% tax on the next $25,000 (from $20,001 to $45,000)**:\n   - Tax: \\( 0.05 \\times 25,000 = 1,250 \\)\n   - Total income covered so far: $45,000\n3. **10% tax on the next $35,000 (from $45,001 to $80,000)**:\n   - Tax: \\( 0.10 \\times 35,000 = 3,500 \\)\n   - Total income covered so far: $80,000\n4. **15% tax on the next $50,000 (from $80,001 to $130,000)**:\n   - Tax: \\( 0.15 \\times 50,000 = 7,500 \\)\n   - Total income covered so far: $130,000\n5. **Calculating Total Tax So Far**:\n   - Tax from first bracket: $0\n   - Tax from second bracket: $1,250\n   - Tax from third bracket: $3,500\n   - Tax from fourth bracket: $7,500\n   - Total Tax from income up to $130,000: \n   \\[\n   0 + 1,250 + 3,500 + 7,500 = 12,250\n   \\]\nAt this point, we see that if Dr. Jones's income is $130,000, he would have paid $12,250 in taxes, which exceeds the $10,000 he actually paid. Therefore, his income must be less than $130,000.\nNext, let's determine how much less than $130,000 he would be.\n### Step 6: Calculate how much he made leading to $10,000 in tax.\nDr. Jones must fall somewhere in the fourth bracket:\n- Up to $80,000 ($0 + $1,250 + $3,500 = $4,750 in taxes).\n- He has paid $10,000 in total tax, so the amount of tax remaining is:\n\\[\n10,000 - 4,750 = 5,250\n\\]\n### Step 7: Use the 15% tax rate in the fourth bracket.\nInside the fourth bracket (from $80,000 to $130,000), he pays a 15% tax. To find out how much income corresponds to the $5,250 tax at this rate, we set up the equation:\n\\[\n0.15x = 5,250\n\\]\nSolving for \\( x \\), we get:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{5,250}{0.15} = 35,000\n\\]\n### Step 8: Calculate Dr. Jones's total income.\nSince this \\( x \\) is added to the maximum of the previous threshold ($80,000):\n\\[\n\\text{Total Income} = 80,000 + 35,000 = 115,000\n\\]\n### Conclusion\nThus, Dr. Jones's total income is \\( \\boxed{115,000} \\).",
