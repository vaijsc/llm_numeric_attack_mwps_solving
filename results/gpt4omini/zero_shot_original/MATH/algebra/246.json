    "solution": "The number of workers is inversely proportional to the amount of time it takes to build a house.  Thus $$\\text{number of workers} \\times \\text{time} = \\text{constant}.$$Using this, we have that $6 \\cdot 1.5 = 15 \\cdot t \\Rightarrow t = .6$.  As a fraction in lowest terms this is $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{5}}$.",

        "To determine how long it takes for 15 construction workers to build a house, we can start by calculating the total work done in terms of \"worker-days.\"\nFirst, we know that 6 construction workers can build a house in 1.5 days. This means the total work required to build the house can be calculated as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Total work (in worker-days)} = \\text{Number of workers} \\times \\text{Number of days} = 6 \\text{ workers} \\times 1.5 \\text{ days} = 9 \\text{ worker-days}\n\\]\nThis tells us that the construction of the house requires a total of 9 worker-days of work.\nNext, we want to know how long it takes for 15 workers to complete the same amount of work (9 worker-days). If we let \\( t \\) be the number of days it takes for 15 workers to finish the job, the total work done by 15 workers in \\( t \\) days can be expressed as:\n\\[\n\\text{Work done by 15 workers} = 15 \\text{ workers} \\times t \\text{ days}\n\\]\nSetting this equal to the total work required (9 worker-days), we get:\n\\[\n15t = 9\n\\]\nTo solve for \\( t \\), we divide both sides by 15:\n\\[\nt = \\frac{9}{15}\n\\]\nNext, we simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{9}{15}\\):\n\\[\nt = \\frac{3}{5}\n\\]\nThus, it takes 15 construction workers \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) of a day to finish building the house. \nIn conclusion, the time it takes for 15 construction workers to finish building the house is \n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{3}{5}}\n\\]",
        "To find out how long it takes for 15 construction workers to finish building a house, we can follow these steps:\n1. **Determine the total work in terms of worker-days:** \n   Since 6 construction workers can build a house in 1.5 days, we calculate the total work done in worker-days. \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total work} = \\text{Number of workers} \\times \\text{Time} = 6 \\text{ workers} \\times 1.5 \\text{ days} = 9 \\text{ worker-days}\n   \\]\n2. **Find out how many days it will take for 15 workers to complete the same work:** \n   We know that the amount of work is the same (9 worker-days), but now we have 15 workers.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Let } t \\text{ be the time taken in days for 15 workers.}\n   \\]\n   The equation for total work in this case is:\n   \\[\n   15 \\text{ workers} \\times t \\text{ days} = 9 \\text{ worker-days}\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( t \\):\n   \\[\n   t = \\frac{9 \\text{ worker-days}}{15 \\text{ workers}} = \\frac{9}{15}\n   \\]\n3. **Simplify the fraction:**\n   Now, simplify \\( \\frac{9}{15} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{9}{15} = \\frac{3}{5} \n   \\]\nTherefore, it takes \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\) of a day for 15 construction workers to finish building a house.
