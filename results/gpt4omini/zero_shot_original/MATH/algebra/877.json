    "solution": "Call the difference between two consecutive terms $x$. The third term is then $2+2x$, and the sixth term is $2+5x$. So, $25 = (2+2x) + (2+5x)$. Solving for $x$ gives $7x = 21$, or $x = 3$. So, the fourth term is $2 + 3\\cdot 3 = \\boxed{11}$.",

        "To find the fourth term of the arithmetic sequence, we can start by establishing some fundamental properties of an arithmetic sequence.\n1. **Define the first term and the common difference**:\n   - Let the first term \\( a = 2 \\).\n   - Let the common difference be \\( d \\).\n2. **Identify the terms**:\n   The \\( n \\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   a_n = a + (n - 1)d\n   \\]\n   Therefore, we can write the third and sixth terms as follows:\n   - Third term \\( a_3 \\):\n   \\[\n   a_3 = a + 2d = 2 + 2d\n   \\]\n   - Sixth term \\( a_6 \\):\n   \\[\n   a_6 = a + 5d = 2 + 5d\n   \\]\n3. **Sum of the third and sixth terms**:\n   According to the problem, the sum of the third and sixth terms is \\( 25 \\):\n   \\[\n   a_3 + a_6 = 25\n   \\]\n   Substituting the expressions for \\( a_3 \\) and \\( a_6 \\) we derived:\n   \\[\n   (2 + 2d) + (2 + 5d) = 25\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this, we get:\n   \\[\n   4 + 7d = 25\n   \\]\n   To isolate \\( d \\), subtract \\( 4 \\) from both sides:\n   \\[\n   7d = 21\n   \\]\n   Now divide by \\( 7 \\):\n   \\[\n   d = 3\n   \\]\n4. **Find the fourth term**:\n   Now that we have \\( d = 3 \\), we can find the fourth term \\( a_4 \\):\n   \\[\n   a_4 = a + 3d = 2 + 3 \\cdot 3\n   \\]\n   Calculating this gives:\n   \\[\n   a_4 = 2 + 9 = 11\n   \\]\nThus, the fourth term of the arithmetic sequence is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{11}\n\\]",
