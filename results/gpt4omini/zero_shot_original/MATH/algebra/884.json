        "To find the change in area when the dimensions of a square change, we start by calculating the original area of the square and then the area after the dimensions are altered.\n1. **Calculate the original area**:\n   The original square has a side length of \\( 3491 \\) units. The area \\( A_{\\text{original}} \\) is given by the formula for the area of a square:\n   \\[\n   A_{\\text{original}} = \\text{side}^2 = 3491^2\n   \\]\n   Now, let's compute \\( 3491^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   3491^2 = 121,489,481\n   \\]\n2. **Calculate the new dimensions**:\n   The length is decreased by \\( 60 \\) units, and the width is increased by \\( 60 \\) units. Therefore:\n   - New length = \\( 3491 - 60 = 3431 \\)\n   - New width = \\( 3491 + 60 = 3551 \\)\n3. **Calculate the new area**:\n   The new area \\( A_{\\text{new}} \\) is calculated using the new dimensions:\n   \\[\n   A_{\\text{new}} = \\text{new length} \\times \\text{new width} = 3431 \\times 3551\n   \\]\n   Now, we compute \\( 3431 \\times 3551 \\). To simplify the calculation, we can break it down:\n   \\[\n   3431 \\times 3551 = 3431 \\times (3500 + 51) = 3431 \\times 3500 + 3431 \\times 51\n   \\]\n   Calculating \\( 3431 \\times 3500 \\):\n   \\[\n   3431 \\times 3500 = 3431 \\times 35 \\times 100 = (3431 \\times 35) \\times 100\n   \\]\n   First, let's compute \\( 3431 \\times 35 \\):\n   \\[\n   3431 \\times 35 = 3431 \\times (30 + 5) = 3431 \\times 30 + 3431 \\times 5 = 102930 + 17155 = 120085\n   \\]\n   Now multiplying by \\( 100 \\):\n   \\[\n   3431 \\times 3500 = 120085 \\times 100 = 12008500\n   \\]\n   Now, calculating \\( 3431 \\times 51 \\):\n   \\[\n   3431 \\times 51 = 3431 \\times (50 + 1) = 3431 \\times 50 + 3431 \\times 1 = 171550 + 3431 = 174981\n   \\]\n   Now, we add these two areas together:\n   \\[\n   A_{\\text{new}} = 12008500 + 174981 = 12183481\n   \\]\n4. **Calculate the change in area**:\n   The change in area \\( \\Delta A \\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta A = A_{\\text{new}} - A_{\\text{original}} = 12183481 - 121489481\n   \\]\n   Performing the subtraction:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta A = 12183481 - 121489481 = 34599\n   \\]\nSo, the area changes by \\( \\Delta A = \\boxed{34599} \\).",
        "To determine the change in area of a square after modifying its dimensions, we start with the original dimensions and calculate both the original and new areas.\n1. **Original dimensions of the square:**\n   - Length = 3491\n   - Width = 3491\n2. **Original area of the square:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Original Area} = \\text{Length} \\times \\text{Width} = 3491 \\times 3491\n   \\]\n   To calculate this, we can express it as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Original Area} = 3491^2\n   \\]\n3. **New dimensions after modification:**\n   - New Length = Original Length - 60 = 3491 - 60 = 3431\n   - New Width = Original Width + 60 = 3491 + 60 = 3551\n4. **New area of the modified dimensions:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{New Area} = \\text{New Length} \\times \\text{New Width} = 3431 \\times 3551\n   \\]\n   To calculate this, we can express it as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{New Area} = 3431 \\times 3551\n   \\]\n5. **Change in area:**\n   The change in area is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Change in Area} = \\text{New Area} - \\text{Original Area}\n   \\]\nNext, let's calculate the original area and the new area.\n**Step 1: Calculate the original area**  \nUsing \\(3491^2\\):\n\\[\n3491^2 = 12183781\n\\]\n**Step 2: Calculate the new area**  \nUsing the values \\(3431\\) and \\(3551\\):\n\\[\n3431 \\times 3551 = 12194281\n\\]\n**Step 3: Calculate the change in area:**\n\\[\n\\text{Change in Area} = 12194281 - 12183781 = 10500\n\\]\nThus, the area of the square changes by **10,500** square units. \nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{10500}\n\\]",
        "To determine how the area of the square changes when its dimensions are altered, we begin with understanding the original dimensions and area of the square.\n1. **Original Dimensions of the Square:**\n   The square has a side length of \\(3491\\).\n2. **Original Area Calculation:**\n   The area \\(A\\) of a square is calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   A = \\text{side length}^2\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the original area \\(A_{\\text{original}}\\) is:\n   \\[\n   A_{\\text{original}} = 3491^2\n   \\]\n3. **Change in Dimensions:**\n   The side length of the square is decreased by \\(60\\), and its width is increased by \\(60\\).
