    "solution": "At the end of one cycle, 3 people have heard the rumor.  At the end of two cycles, $3+9$ people have heard the rumor.  At the end of three cycles, $3+9+27$ people have heard the rumor, and so on.

        "To solve this problem, we can analyze how the rumor spreads through the cycles.\n1. **Cycle 1**: Sam tells the rumor to 3 friends.\n   - Total people who heard the rumor: 3\n2. **Cycle 2**: Each of Sam's 3 friends tells the rumor to 3 new friends. So, each of the 3 friends reaches 3 more people.\n   - Total new people hearing the rumor in this cycle: \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\)\n   - Cumulative total after this cycle (including Cycle 1): \\(3 + 9 = 12\\)\n3. **Cycle 3**: Each of the 9 friends from Cycle 2 tells the rumor to 3 new friends. \n   - Total new people hearing the rumor in this cycle: \\(9 \\times 3 = 27\\)\n   - Cumulative total after this cycle: \\(12 + 27 = 39\\)\n4. **Cycle 4**: Each of the 27 friends from Cycle 3 now tells the rumor to 3 new friends.\n   - Total new people hearing the rumor in this cycle: \\(27 \\times 3 = 81\\)\n   - Cumulative total after this cycle: \\(39 + 81 = 120\\)\n5. **Cycle 5**: Each of the 81 friends from Cycle 4 tells the rumor to 3 new friends.\n   - Total new people hearing the rumor in this cycle: \\(81 \\times 3 = 243\\)\n   - Cumulative total after this cycle: \\(120 + 243 = 363\\)\nSo, by the end of the fifth cycle, a total of 363 people, not including Sam, will have heard the rumor. \nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{363}\n\\]",
        "To determine how many people will have heard the rumor after five cycles, we can analyze the situation step-by-step.\n1. **First cycle**: Sam tells 3 friends.\n   - Total: 3 people have heard the rumor.\n2. **Second cycle**: Each of Sam's 3 friends tells the rumor to 3 new friends.\n   - Each of the 3 friends tells 3 new people, so: \n   \\[\n   3 \\times 3 = 9 \\text{ new people}\n   \\]\n   - Total heard the rumor now: \\(3 + 9 = 12\\).\n3. **Third cycle**: Each of the 9 new people tells the rumor to 3 new friends.\n   - Each of the 9 tells 3 new people, so:\n   \\[\n   9 \\times 3 = 27 \\text{ new people}\n   \\]\n   - Total heard the rumor now: \\(12 + 27 = 39\\).\n4. **Fourth cycle**: Each of the 27 new people tells the rumor to 3 new friends.\n   - Each of the 27 tells 3 new people, so:\n   \\[\n   27 \\times 3 = 81 \\text{ new people}\n   \\]\n   - Total heard the rumor now: \\(39 + 81 = 120\\).\n5. **Fifth cycle**: Each of the 81 new people tells the rumor to 3 new friends.\n   - Each of the 81 tells 3 new people, so:\n   \\[\n   81 \\times 3 = 243 \\text{ new people}\n   \\]\n   - Total heard the rumor now: \\(120 + 243 = 363\\).\nSo after all five cycles, the total number of people who have heard the rumor, not including Sam, is **363**.",
