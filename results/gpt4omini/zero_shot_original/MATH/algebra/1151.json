        "To find the minimum value of the function \\( y = x^2 - 7 \\), we can analyze the quadratic expression.\n1. **Identify the Vertex**: The expression \\( y = x^2 - 7 \\) is a quadratic function in the standard form \\( y = ax^2 + bx + c \\), where \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 0 \\), and \\( c = -7 \\). Since \\( a > 0 \\), the parabola opens upwards, indicating that it has a minimum point.\n2. **Calculate the Vertex**:\n   The x-coordinate of the vertex of a parabola given by \\( y = ax^2 + bx + c \\) can be found using the formula \\( x = -\\frac{b}{2a} \\).\n   In this case, since \\( b = 0 \\):\n   \\[\n   x = -\\frac{0}{2 \\cdot 1} = 0\n   \\]\n3. **Substitute the x-coordinate back into the equation**:\n   Now we substitute \\( x = 0 \\) back into the equation to find the y-coordinate:\n   \\[\n   y = (0)^2 - 7 = 0 - 7 = -7\n   \\]\n4. **Conclusion**: The minimum value of \\( y \\) occurs at the vertex, and it is:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{-7}\n   \\]\nThis means the minimum value possible for \\( y \\) is \\( -7 \\) when \\( x = 0 \\).",
        "To find the minimum value of the function \\( y = x^2 - 7 \\), we will analyze the expression step by step.\n1. **Identify the quadratic form**: The given equation is a quadratic function in the form \\( y = ax^2 + bx + c \\) where \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 0 \\), and \\( c = -7 \\).
