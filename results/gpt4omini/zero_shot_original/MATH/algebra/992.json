    "solution": "Though we can solve this by substitution, an easier way to solve the problem is to simply add the two equations. Then, $$ab + 5a + 2b = -10 \\Longrightarrow ab + 5a + 2b + 10 = 0.$$ This factors! Thus, $(a+2)(b+5) = 0$, from which it follows that at least one of the two statements $a = -2$, $b = -5$ is true. In the latter case, we obtain $a = \\boxed{2}$, which yields the largest possible value of $a$.",

        "To solve for the greatest possible value of \\( a \\) in the system of equations \n\\[\n5a + 2b = 0 \n\\]\nand \n\\[\nab = -10,\n\\]\nwe first solve the first equation for \\( b \\):\n1.

Next, we substitute this expression for \\( b \\) into the second equation:\n   \\[\n   a\\left(-\\frac{5}{2}a\\right) = -10.\n   \\]\n3. Simplifying this, we get:\n   \\[\n   -\\frac{5}{2}a^2 = -10.\n   \\]\n4. To eliminate the negative sign, we can multiply both sides by \\(-1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{5}{2}a^2 = 10.\n   \\]\n5. Now, multiply both sides by \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\) to isolate \\( a^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   a^2 = 10 \\cdot \\frac{2}{5} = 4.\n   \\]\n6.
