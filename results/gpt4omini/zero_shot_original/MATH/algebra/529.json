        "The expression \\(\\frac{x-3}{x^2-10x+16}\\) is undefined when the denominator is equal to zero. Thus, we need to solve the equation:\n\\[\nx^2 - 10x + 16 = 0\n\\]\nTo solve this quadratic equation, we can factor it. We look for two numbers that multiply to \\(16\\) (the constant term) and add up to \\(-10\\) (the coefficient of \\(x\\)). These two numbers are \\(-2\\) and \\(-8\\). Therefore, we can factor the quadratic as:\n\\[\n(x - 2)(x - 8) = 0\n\\]\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives us the potential values of \\(x\\):\n\\[\nx - 2 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = 2\n\\]\n\\[\nx - 8 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = 8\n\\]\nThe expression is undefined for \\(x = 2\\) and \\(x = 8\\). \nNext, we find the sum of all these values:\n\\[\n2 + 8 = 10\n\\]\nThus, the sum of all values of \\(x\\) for which the expression \\(\\frac{x-3}{x^2-10x+16}\\) is undefined is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{10}\n\\]",
