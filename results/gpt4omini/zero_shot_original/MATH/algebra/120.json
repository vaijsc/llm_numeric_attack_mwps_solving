        "To evaluate \\(\\log_2 64\\), we can use the definition of logarithms, which states that if \\(y = \\log_b x\\), then \\(b^y = x\\). In this case, we want to find \\(y\\) such that:\n\\[\n2^y = 64\n\\]\nNext, we need to express \\(64\\) as a power of \\(2\\). We can do this by repeatedly dividing \\(64\\) by \\(2\\):\n\\[\n64 \\div 2 = 32\n\\]\n\\[\n32 \\div 2 = 16\n\\]\n\\[\n16 \\div 2 = 8\n\\]\n\\[\n8 \\div 2 = 4\n\\]\n\\[\n4 \\div 2 = 2\n\\]\n\\[\n2 \\div 2 = 1\n\\]\nWe can count the divisions, which gives us:\n\\[\n64 = 2^6\n\\]\nNow we can substitute back into our logarithm equation:\n\\[\n2^y = 2^6\n\\]\nSince the bases are the same, we can equate the exponents:\n\\[\ny = 6\n\\]\nThus, we find that:\n\\[\n\\log_2 64 = 6\n\\]\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{6}\n\\]",
        "To evaluate \\(\\log_2 64\\), we want to determine what power we need to raise 2 to in order to get 64. In other words, we are looking for \\(x\\) such that:\n\\[\n2^x = 64\n\\]\nTo solve for \\(x\\), we need to express 64 as a power of 2. Let's perform the calculation step-by-step:\n1. **Factor 64 into powers of 2:**\n   \\[\n   64 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^6\n   \\]\n   (We can also confirm this by calculating: \\(2^1 = 2\\), \\(2^2 = 4\\), \\(2^3 = 8\\), \\(2^4 = 16\\), \\(2^5 = 32\\), and \\(2^6 = 64\\)).\n2. **Set the equation:**\n   Since we have found that \\(64 = 2^6\\), we can rewrite our logarithmic equation:\n   \\[\n   2^x = 2^6\n   \\]\n3. **Equate the exponents:**\n   Since the bases are equal, we can equate the exponents:\n   \\[\n   x = 6\n   \\]\nTherefore, we conclude that:\n\\[\n\\log_2 64 = 6\n\\]\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{6}\n\\]",
