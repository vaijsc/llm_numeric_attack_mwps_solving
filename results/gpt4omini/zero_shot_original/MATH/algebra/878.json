Hence, any \\( (a, 0, c)\\) is valid for \\(0 \\leq a, c \\leq 5\\).\n   - Total combinations = \\(6 \\times 6 = 36\\) (since \\(a\\) can independently take \\(6\\) values and \\(c\\) can also take \\(6\\)).\n3. **When \\( c = 0 \\)**:\n   - The equation simplifies similarly to \\(a^2 \\cdot 0 + 0 + 0 - a \\cdot 0 - 0 - 0 = 0\\). Thus, any \\( (a, b, 0) \\) is valid.\n   - Again, total combinations = \\(6 \\times 6 = 36\\).\n### Case 2: All variables are equal\nSetting \\( a = b = c = k \\) for \\( k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \\),\n- Substituting this gives \\(k^3 + k^3 + k^3 - k^3 - k^3 - k^3 = 0\\), which is always true for \\(k\\).\n- There are \\(6\\) solutions from here, corresponding to \\( (0,0,0), (1,1,1), (2,2,2), (3,3,3), (4,4,4), (5,5,5)\\).\n### Summary of solutions:\nWe now summarize the total counted:\n- From case \\(a = 0\\): \\(18\\)\n- From case \\(b = 0\\): \\(36\\)\n- From case \\(c = 0\\): \\(36\\)\n- Overlap from all being equal: To avoid over-counting, we observed that the solutions where \\( a = b = c \\) were included repeatedly:\nCount all unique solutions: \nEach of \\(a = 0\\), \\(b = 0\\), and \\(c = 0\\) gives us triples already counted in various combinations. \nEvery unique case includes:\n- \\((0, b, c)\\), \\((a, 0, c)\\), \\((a, b, 0)\\) -- counted distinctly, plus a new addition for \\(a = b = c\\).\nEach slot must regard unique values, leading us to:\nFinal total calculates through inclusivity and constraints on bounds.\nThe unique ordered triples satisfying this equation result in:\n\\(\\boxed{126}\\).",
        "To solve the problem, we need to analyze the equation:\n\\[\na^2b + b^2c + c^2a - ab^2 - bc^2 - ca^2 = 0.\n\\]\nLet's rewrite the equation in a more manageable form:\n\\[\na^2b - ab^2 + b^2c - bc^2 + c^2a - ca^2 = 0.\n\\]\nThis can be factored by grouping terms carefully. Noticing the symmetry in the terms, we factor them as follows:\n\\[\nab(a - b) + bc(b - c) + ca(c - a) = 0.\n\\]\nTo interpret this, we can analyze cases based on the equalities of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\).\n### Case 1: All variables are equal\nIf \\(a = b = c\\), then we denote this common value by \\(k\\). The equation simplifies to:\n\\[\nk^2 k - k k^2 - k k^2 = 0,\n\\]\nwhich is always true for any integer \\(k\\). Since \\(0 \\leq k \\leq 5\\), there are 6 solutions in this case: \\((0,0,0), (1,1,1), (2,2,2), (3,3,3), (4,4,4), (5,5,5)\\).\n### Case 2: Two variables are equal, and one is different\nAssume \\(a = b \\neq c\\). Then our equation becomes:\n\\[\na^2 a - a c^2 + c^2 a - a^2 c = 0 \\implies a^3 + c^2 a - a^2 c = 0.\n\\]\nFactoring out \\(a\\) gives:\n\\[\na (a^2 + c^2 - ac) = 0.\n\\]\nThus, either \\(a = 0\\) or \\(a^2 + c^2 - ac = 0\\). \n1. **If \\(a = 0\\)**, we can have \\(b = 0\\) and \\(c\\) take any value from 0 to 5. Therefore, we have 6 solutions: \\((0,0,c)\\) for \\(c=0,1,2,3,4,5\\).\n2. **If \\(a^2 + c^2 - ac = 0\\)**, rearranging gives \\(c^2 - ac + a^2 = 0\\). The discriminant of this quadratic must be non-negative:\n\\[\n(-a)^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot a^2 = a^2 - 4a^2 = -3a^2 < 0 \\quad \\text{(for } a \\neq 0\\text{)}.\n\\]\nThis means there are no real solutions in this case unless \\(a = 0\\).\nNow switching roles, assume \\(b = c \\neq a\\). The same deduction holds as shown above for the case of equality.\nIn summary, the pairs for this case yield the results:\n- \\((a,a,c)\\) where \\(0 \\leq a < c \\leq 5\\): From \\(a=0\\), we have 6.\n- \\((a,c,c)\\) where \\(0 \\leq c < a \\leq 5\\): Deducing similarly results in 6 solutions.\n### Case 3: All different variables\nSuppose \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all distinct. Then no factorization will yield valid conditions, since it mirrors already considered setups leading them to equality or back to trivial checks.\n### Conclusion\nAdding our findings from each case:\n- Case 1 (all equal): 6 solutions\n- Case 2 (two equal): Valid configurations with \\(0\\) from either mostly mirror the other ones, adding \\(6\\) total distinct setups.\n- Case 3 (all different): Yields no new outcomes.\nThus, we count only unique configurations without overlap. Successively checking gives:\n\\[\n\\text{Total solutions} = 6 \\text{ (from all equal) } + 12 \\text{ (from two equal and configurations considered in pairs)} = 18.\n\\]\nWe conclude the total ordered triples \\((a,b,c)\\) satisfying the equation is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{36}.\n\\]",

Rewrite the expression grouped by pairs:\n\\[\nab(a - b) + bc(b - c) + ca(c - a) = 0.\n\\]\nTo find solutions, we will analyze various cases based on the values of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\).\n1. **Case 1**: If \\(a = b\\). Substitute \\(b = a\\):\n\\[\na^2a + a^2c + c^2a - a^3 - ac^2 - ca^2 = 0 \\implies a^2c + c^2a - ac^2 - a^3 = 0.\n\\]\nThis simplifies further since \\(c\\) is involved in each term.\n2. **Case 2**: If \\(b = c\\). Substitute \\(c = b\\):\n\\[\na^2b + b^2b + b^2a - ab^2 - b^2b - ba^2 = 0 \\implies a^2b + ab^2 - ba^2 = 0.\n\\]\n2. **Case 3**: If \\(c = a\\). Substitute \\(c = a\\):\n\\[\na^2b + b^2a + a^2a - ab^2 - ba^2 - aa^2 = 0,\n\\]\nWe observe that if all pairs among \\(a, b, c\\) are equal, the equation holds as they will cancel out.\n3. **Diverging Cases Based on Pairs**: Let\u2019s analyze with specific pairs \\(a = b\\) or \\(b = c\\), and \\(a = c\\) while others vary. \n### Generating Solutions\nWe can start iterating through explicit values since how many integers exist from \\(0\\) to \\(5\\), there are clearly only \\(6\\) values for \\(a, b, c\\). \nLet\u2019s evaluate fundamental cases numerically.\n---\nWhen \\(a=b=c\\):\n\\[\n(0,0,0), (1,1,1), (2,2,2), (3,3,3), (4,4,4), (5,5,5) \\Rightarrow \\text{count = 6} \n\\]\nWhen two are equal (e.g., \\(a=b\\)) where \\(c\\) is either less than or equal:\n- \\(0 \\leq a = b \\leq 5\\) gives \\(6\\) choices for each value of \\(a\\)\n  - For \\(c=0 \\rightarrow 1\\) value \n  - For \\(c=1 \\rightarrow 2\\) values \n  - So forth, continuing until \\(c = a\\), total \\(21\\).\nThis yields more spanning combinations for \\(3\\) cases. Overall:\n### Find the Total\nCount up distinct structures per symmetry where:\n- **All Equal** contributes strongly\n- **Two Equal** account each scenario\nThis echoes symmetric contributions defined tactically through checking values manually for validation in a simple \\( \\mathbb{Z}^3 \\) structure.\nFinal total combinations were outlined through evaluations expanded to a total of **over \\(80\\) distinct arrangements.** \nIn conclusion, the number of ordered triples \\((a, b, c)\\) satisfying the equation is \\(\\boxed{80}\\).",
