    "solution": "Let the popularity of a television (or the number of customers who buy one) equal $p$, and let the cost of the television equal $c$. According to Daniel's theory, $p$ and $c$ are inversely proportional. Thus, $(p)(c)=k$ for some constant value $k$. If $p=15$ when $c=1500$, then $k=(15)(1500)=22500$. So when $c=2500$, \\begin{align*} (p)(c)&=k\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad (p)(2500)&=22500\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad p&=\\frac{22500}{2500}\n\\\\ &=\\boxed{9}.\n\\end{align*}According to Daniel's theory, 9 customers would buy the $\\$2500$ television.",

        "To analyze Daniel's claim that the popularity of a television (measured in number of sales \\( S \\)) is inversely proportional to its cost \\( C \\), we can express this relationship mathematically as:\n\\[\nS \\propto \\frac{1}{C}\n\\]\nThis means we can write:\n\\[\nS = \\frac{k}{C}\n\\]\nfor some constant \\( k \\).\nGiven that when the cost of a television is \\$1500, the number of sales is 15, we can use this information to find the value of \\( k \\).\nSubstituting the known values into the equation:\n\\[\n15 = \\frac{k}{1500}\n\\]\nTo solve for \\( k \\), we multiply both sides by 1500:\n\\[\nk = 15 \\times 1500 = 22500\n\\]\nNow that we have determined \\( k \\), we can use it to find out how many customers would buy a television that costs \\$2500.\nSubstituting the cost of \\$2500 into the equation \\( S = \\frac{k}{C} \\):\n\\[\nS = \\frac{22500}{2500}\n\\]\nCalculating the right side:\n\\[\nS = \\frac{22500 \\div 2500}{1} = 9\n\\]\nThus, according to Daniel's theory, the number of customers that would buy a television costing \\$2500 is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{9}\n\\]",
        "Let's denote the number of customers as \\( N \\) and the cost of the television as \\( C \\). According to Daniel's theory, the number of customers is inversely proportional to the cost, which means we can express this relationship mathematically as:\n\\[\nN = \\frac{k}{C}\n\\]\nwhere \\( k \\) is a constant.\nFrom the information provided, when the cost \\( C = 1500 \\), the number of customers \\( N = 15 \\). We can use this information to find the constant \\( k \\).\n1. Substitute the values into the equation:\n\\[\n15 = \\frac{k}{1500}\n\\]\n2. Multiplying both sides by 1500 gives:\n\\[\nk = 15 \\times 1500\n\\]\n3. Calculating \\( k \\):\n\\[\nk = 22500\n\\]\nNow that we have determined the constant \\( k \\), we can find the number of customers for a television that costs \\( 2500 \\).\n4. Substitute the new cost into the relationship:\n\\[\nN = \\frac{22500}{2500}\n\\]\n5. Performing the calculation:\n\\[\nN = \\frac{22500}{2500} = 9\n\\]\nTherefore, according to Daniel's theory, if the television costs \\$2500, the number of customers that would buy the television is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{9}\n\\]",
        "According to Daniel\u2019s claim, the popularity of a television (number of sales) is inversely proportional to its cost. This means that we can express the relationship with the equation:\n\\[\nP \\propto \\frac{1}{C}\n\\]\nwhere \\(P\\) is the number of sales and \\(C\\) is the cost of the television. We can rewrite this relationship as:\n\\[\nP = \\frac{k}{C}\n\\]\nwhere \\(k\\) is a constant of proportionality.\nFrom the information given, we know that when the cost \\(C = 1500\\), the number of sales \\(P = 15\\).

        "To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of inverse proportionality. According to Daniel's claim, the number of sales \\( S \\) is inversely proportional to the cost \\( C \\).

        "To determine how many customers would buy a television that costs \\$2500 based on Daniel's theory of inverse proportionality, we start with the given information.\n1. **Daniel's Claim**: The popularity (number of sales, \\( S \\)) of a television is inversely proportional to its cost (\\( C \\)). This can be represented mathematically as:\n   \\[\n   S = \\frac{k}{C}\n   \\]\n   where \\( k \\) is a constant.\n2. **Initial Condition**: We know that when the cost \\( C = 1500 \\), the number of customers (sales) \\( S = 15 \\). We can use this information to find the constant \\( k \\).\n3. **Calculate \\( k \\)**:\n   \\[\n   15 = \\frac{k}{1500}\n   \\]\n   To solve for \\( k \\), we can rearrange the equation:\n   \\[\n   k = 15 \\times 1500\n   \\]\n   So:\n   \\[\n   k = 22500\n   \\]\n4. **Finding Sales at New Cost**: Now that we have \\( k \\), we can find the number of customers who would buy a television that costs \\$2500.\n5. **Set Up the Equation with New Cost**:\n   \\[\n   S = \\frac{22500}{2500}\n   \\]\n   Now, calculate \\( S \\):\n   \\[\n   S = \\frac{22500}{2500} = 9\n   \\]\nTherefore, according to Daniel's theory, if a television costs \\$2500, the number of customers that would buy it is **9**."
