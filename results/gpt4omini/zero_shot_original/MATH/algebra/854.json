    "solution": "Let $x$ be the cost per square inch of gold paint, and let $y$ be the cost per cubic inch of concrete.  Since a 1 inch cube has surface area 6 $\\text{in}^2$ and volume 1 $\\text{in}^3$ its total price will be $6x+y$ dollars.  Similarly, a 2 inch cube has surface area 24 $\\text{in}^2$ and volume 8 $\\text{in}^3$, so its total price will be $24x+8y$ dollars.  We are given that \\begin{align*} 6x+y &=\\$1.30 \\\\ 24x+8y&= \\$6.80 \\end{align*} Subtracting 4 times the first equation from the second gives $4y=\\$1.60$, so $y=\\$0.40$.  Hence $6x=\\$0.90$, so $x=\\$0.15$.  Since a 3 inch cube has surface area 54 $\\text{in}^2$ and volume 27 $\\text{in}^3$, its total price will be a total of $54(\\$0.15)+27(\\$0.40)=\\boxed{\\$18.90}$.",

        "To solve the problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the cost of the concrete and the cost of the paint for the cubes.\n1. **Calculate the costs for the 1 inch cube:**\n   - **Volume:** The volume \\( V \\) of a cube with side length \\( s \\) is given by \\( V = s^3 \\). For a 1 inch cube:\n     \\[\n     V = 1^3 = 1 \\text{ cubic inch}\n     \\]\n   - **Surface Area:** The surface area \\( A \\) of a cube is given by \\( A = 6s^2 \\).
