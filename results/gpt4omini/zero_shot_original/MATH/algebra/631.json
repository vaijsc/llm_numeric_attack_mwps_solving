        "To solve the problem, we start by expressing the sums of the two infinite geometric series.\n1. **Sum of the first series**:\n   The first series has a leading term \\( a \\) and a common ratio \\( b \\). The sum \\( S \\) of an infinite geometric series is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   S = \\frac{a}{1 - b}\n   \\]\n   for \\( |b| < 1 \\).\n2. **Sum of the second series**:\n   The second series has a leading term \\( b \\) and a common ratio \\( a \\). The sum of this series is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{S} = \\frac{b}{1 - a}\n   \\]\n   for \\( |a| < 1 \\).\n3. **Setting up the equation**:\n   We have two expressions for the sum \\( S \\) and \\( \\frac{1}{S} \\):\n   \\[\n   S = \\frac{a}{1 - b}\n   \\]\n   and\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{S} = \\frac{b}{1 - a}.\n   \\]\n   Taking the reciprocal of the first equation gives:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{S} = \\frac{1 - b}{a}.\n   \\]\n4. **Equating the two expressions for \\( \\frac{1}{S} \\)**:\n   We can relate the two expressions for \\( \\frac{1}{S} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1 - b}{a} = \\frac{b}{1 - a}.\n   \\]\n5. **Cross multiplying**:\n   Cross multiplying gives:\n   \\[\n   (1 - b)(1 - a) = ab.\n   \\]\n   Expanding both sides, we have:\n   \\[\n   1 - a - b + ab = ab.\n   \\]\n   We simplify this to:\n   \\[\n   1 - a - b = 0.\n   \\]\n   Thus, we can rearrange this to find:\n   \\[\n   a + b = 1.\n   \\]\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   We have found that:\n   \\[\n   a + b = 1.\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the value of \\( a + b \\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{1}.\n   \\]",
        "To find \\( a + b \\), we start by analyzing the two infinite geometric series.\nThe sum of an infinite geometric series can be computed using the formula:\n\\[\nS = \\frac{\\text{first term}}{1 - \\text{common ratio}}\n\\]\nThis requires that the common ratio is less than 1 in absolute value.\n#### For the first series:\n- Leading term: \\( a \\)\n- Common ratio: \\( b \\)\nThus, the sum \\( S \\) of the first series is given by:\n\\[\nS = \\frac{a}{1 - b} \\quad \\text{(1)}\n\\]\n#### For the second series:\n- Leading term: \\( b \\)\n- Common ratio: \\( a \\)\nThus, the sum of the second series is given by:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{S} = \\frac{b}{1 - a} \\quad \\text{(2)}\n\\]\n### Next, we manipulate these expressions.\nFrom equation (1):\n\\[\nS(1 - b) = a\n\\]\nSubstituting \\( S \\) from equation (1) into equation (2):\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\frac{a}{1 - b}} = \\frac{b}{1 - a}\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\frac{1 - b}{a} = \\frac{b}{1 - a}\n\\]\nNow we cross-multiply to eliminate the fractions:\n\\[\n(1 - b)(1 - a) = ab\n\\]\n### Expanding both sides:\nExpanding the left side:\n\\[\n1 - a - b + ab = ab\n\\]\nThis leads to:\n\\[\n1 - a - b = 0\n\\]\nSo we have:\n\\[\na + b = 1 \\quad \\text{(3)}\n\\]\nThus, we conclude that the value of \\( a + b \\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\] \n### Verification:\nTo ensure the correctness of our solution, we consider the derived equation:\n\\( 1 - a - b = 0 \\) implies that both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) fall within the required conditions for convergence of their respective series, i.e., \\( |b| < 1 \\) and \\( |a| < 1 \\) when \\( a + b = 1 \\). This holds true under the conditions set for the convergence of both series. The derived values satisfy the sum equations and conditions for a valid infinite geometric series. Therefore, the result is consistent and correct. ",
        "To find the values of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) such that the given conditions regarding the infinite geometric series are satisfied, we start with the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series, \\( S = \\frac{a}{1-b} \\) provided that \\( |b| < 1 \\).\n1. **Sum of the first series:**\n   The first series has a leading term \\( a \\) and common ratio \\( b \\):\n   \\[\n   S = \\frac{a}{1-b} \\quad \\text{(for } |b| < 1 \\text{)}\n   \\]\n2. **Sum of the second series:**\n   The second series has a leading term \\( b \\) and common ratio \\( a \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{S} = \\frac{b}{1-a} \\quad \\text{(for } |a| < 1 \\text{)}\n   \\]\n   From the sum \\( S \\) found earlier, we write:\n   \\[\n   S = \\frac{a}{1-b} \\implies \\frac{1}{S} = \\frac{1-b}{a}\n   \\]\n   Setting both expressions for \\( \\frac{1}{S} \\) equal gives:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1-b}{a} = \\frac{b}{1-a}\n   \\]\n3. **Cross multiply to solve for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\):**\n   Cross-multiplying leads to:\n   \\[\n   (1-b)(1-a) = ab\n   \\]\n   Expanding both sides results in:\n   \\[\n   1 - a - b + ab = ab\n   \\]\n   Rearranging gives:\n   \\[\n   1 - a - b = 0 \\implies 1 = a + b\n   \\]\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   Therefore, the value of \\( a+b \\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{1}\n   \\] \nNow we can verify if \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) allow for the conditions \\( |a| < 1 \\) and \\( |b| < 1 \\) to be true, since \\( a + b = 1 \\) suggests that \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) can indeed take values such as \\( a = \\frac{1}{2} \\) and \\( b = \\frac{1}{2} \\), confirming their validity. And since both series converge under these conditions, our value \\( a + b = 1 \\) holds true under the specified constraints.",
