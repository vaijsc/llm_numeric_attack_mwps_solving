    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Raymond consumes a total of $10\\cdot12=120$ calories at snack. If he eats $c$ cookies, he would get $20c$ calories, so since he needs this to equal 120, he must eat $c=120/20=\\boxed{6}$ cookies.",

        "To find out how many 20-calorie cookies Raymond would need to consume the same number of calories as his usual snack of ten 12-calorie crackers, we can follow these steps:\n1. **Calculate the total calories in the crackers**:\n   - Each cracker has 12 calories.\n   - Raymond eats 10 crackers, so the total number of calories from the crackers is:\n     \\[\n     10 \\, \\text{crackers} \\times 12 \\, \\text{calories/cracker} = 120 \\, \\text{calories}\n     \\]\n2. **Determine how many cookies are needed to match those calories**:\n   - Each cookie has 20 calories.\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the number of cookies Raymond needs to consume to equal 120 calories. The equation will be:\n     \\[\n     20 \\, \\text{calories/cookie} \\times x \\, \\text{cookies} = 120 \\, \\text{calories}\n     \\]\n3. **Solve for \\( x \\)**:\n   - To find \\( x \\), we can rearrange the equation:\n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{120 \\, \\text{calories}}{20 \\, \\text{calories/cookie}} = 6\n     \\]\nTherefore, Raymond would need to eat **6 cookies** to consume the same number of calories as his snack of ten 12-calorie crackers.",
