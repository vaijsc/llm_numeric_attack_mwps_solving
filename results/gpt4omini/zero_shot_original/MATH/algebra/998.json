    "solution": "Our point lies on $5x-9y=42$ with the condition that $x=-y$. Thus, we have the system of equations \\begin{align*}\n5x-9y &= 42\\\\\nx &= -y.\n\\end{align*} Substituting $x= -y$ into the first equation gives  \\begin{align*}\n5(-y) -9y &=42\\\\\n\\Rightarrow -14y &= 42\\\\\n\\Rightarrow y &=-3.\n\\end{align*} Thus $x = -y = -(-3) = 3$, so our desired point is $\\boxed{(3,-3)}$.",
