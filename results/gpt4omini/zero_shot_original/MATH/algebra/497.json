    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "To find the number of criminals that Wonder Woman can capture in $4 \\frac{1}{2}$ hours, we multiply how many criminals she can capture per hour by the number of hours she spends capturing criminals. Thus, she can capture $6 \\cdot (4 \\frac{1}{2})=6 \\cdot \\frac{9}{2} = \\boxed{27}$ criminals in $4 \\frac{1}{2}$ hours.",

        "To find out how many criminals Wonder Woman can capture in \\( 4\\frac{1}{2} \\) hours, we'll first convert \\( 4\\frac{1}{2} \\) hours into a decimal:\n\\[\n4\\frac{1}{2} = 4 + \\frac{1}{2} = 4 + 0.5 = 4.5 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\nNext, we know that Wonder Woman can capture 6 criminals in 1 hour. To find out how many criminals she can catch in \\( 4.5 \\) hours, we can multiply the number of criminals she can catch in 1 hour by the total number of hours:\n\\[\n\\text{Total criminals} = \\text{Criminals per hour} \\times \\text{Total hours}\n\\]\nSubstituting the known values:\n\\[\n\\text{Total criminals} = 6 \\text{ criminals/hour} \\times 4.5 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\nNow, we perform the multiplication:\n\\[\n\\text{Total criminals} = 6 \\times 4.5 = 27\n\\]\nThus, Wonder Woman can capture a total of \\( 27 \\) criminals in \\( 4 \\frac{1}{2} \\) hours.",
        "To determine how many criminals Wonder Woman can capture in \\(4 \\frac{1}{2}\\) hours, we can follow these steps:\n1. **Convert hours into a more manageable form**:  \n   First, we need to convert \\(4 \\frac{1}{2}\\) hours into an improper fraction or a decimal.  \n   \\(4 \\frac{1}{2} = 4 + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{8}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{9}{2}\\) hours.  \n   We can also express this as a decimal: \\(4.5\\) hours.\n2. **Determine the rate of capturing criminals**:  \n   We know that Wonder Woman captures 6 criminals in 1 hour.
