    "solution": "We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to get  $$s=9-2(3s+1)=9-6s-2.$$Moving the variable terms to the left-hand side and the constants to the right-hand side, we find $$s+6s=7.$$This gives  $s=1$ which we may plug into either equation to get $t$. For example, $$t=3(1)+1=4.$$So the lines intersect at the point $\\boxed{(1,4)}$.",

        "To find the intersection of the lines given by the equations \\( s = 9 - 2t \\) and \\( t = 3s + 1 \\), we will solve these equations simultaneously.\n1. We start with the first equation:\n   \\[\n   s = 9 - 2t\n   \\]\n2. Next, we substitute this expression for \\( s \\) into the second equation:\n   \\[\n   t = 3(9 - 2t) + 1\n   \\]\n3. Now, we simplify this expression:\n   \\[\n   t = 27 - 6t + 1\n   \\]\n   Combining the constants, we have:\n   \\[\n   t = 28 - 6t\n   \\]\n4. To isolate \\( t \\), we add \\( 6t \\) to both sides:\n   \\[\n   t + 6t = 28\n   \\]\n   which simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   7t = 28\n   \\]\n5. Dividing both sides by 7 gives us:\n   \\[\n   t = 4\n   \\]\n6. Now that we have the value of \\( t \\), we can substitute it back into the first equation to find \\( s \\):\n   \\[\n   s = 9 - 2(4)\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this, we find:\n   \\[\n   s = 9 - 8 = 1\n   \\]\n7. Thus, the coordinates of the intersection point are:\n   \\[\n   (s, t) = (1, 4)\n   \\]\nTherefore, the point at which the lines intersect is \\(\\boxed{(1, 4)}\\).",
