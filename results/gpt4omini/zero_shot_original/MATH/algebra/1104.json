    "solution": "Suppose the price of the cellphone is reduced to $450 - 5x$ dollars; then it will sell $500 + 10x$ units, so the revenue will be\n\\begin{align*}\n(450 - 5x)(500 + 10x) &= 5(90 - x) 10(50 + x) \\\\\n&= 50 (90 - x)(50 + x) \\\\\n&= 50 (-x^2  + 40x + 4500),\n\\end{align*}in dollars.\n\nCompleting the square on $-x^2 + 40x + 4500,$ we get\n\\begin{align*}\n50 (-x^2 + 40x + 4500) &= 50 (-(x - 20)^2 + 400 + 4500) \\\\\n&= 50 (-(x - 20)^2 + 4900) \\\\\n&= -50 (x - 20)^2 + 245000.\n\\end{align*}This is maximized when $x = 20,$ so the optimal price of the smartphone is $450 - 5(20) = \\boxed{350}$ dollars.",

        "To find the price of the smartphone that results in maximum revenue, we first need to express the revenue as a function of the price.\nLet:\n- \\( p \\) be the price of the smartphone in dollars.\n- \\( x \\) be the number of \\( \\$5 \\) price decreases.\nGiven:\n- The initial price of the smartphone is \\( \\$450 \\).\n- The shop currently sells \\( 500 \\) smartphones per week.\nWhen the price decreases by \\( \\$5 \\) for each decrease \\( x \\), the new price can be expressed as:\n\\[\np = 450 - 5x\n\\]\nFor each decrease of \\( \\$5 \\), the number of smartphones sold increases by \\( 10 \\).
