        "To find out how many calories Kendra would burn shooting hoops for one week, we can follow these steps:\n1. **Calculate calories burned per day**:  \n   Kendra burns 150 calories for shooting hoops for 30 minutes.\n2. **Calculate calories burned in one week (7 days)**:  \n   If she continues this for 7 days, we can multiply the daily calories burned by the number of days in a week:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total calories burned in one week} = \\text{Calories burned per day} \\times \\text{Number of days}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total calories burned in one week} = 150 \\text{ calories/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days}\n   \\]\n3. **Perform the calculation**:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total calories burned in one week} = 150 \\times 7 = 1050 \\text{ calories}\n   \\]\nThus, Kendra would burn **1,050 calories** shooting hoops for 30 minutes every day for one week.",
        "To calculate the total number of calories Kendra would burn shooting hoops for one week, we can follow these steps:\n1. **Determine daily calorie burn**: Kendra burns 150 calories shooting hoops for 30 minutes.\n   \n2. **Calculate weekly calorie burn**: If she plays every day for a week (7 days), we multiply the daily calorie burn by the number of days:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total calories burned in a week} = \\text{Daily calories burned} \\times \\text{Number of days}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values we have:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total calories burned in a week} = 150 \\, \\text{calories/day} \\times 7 \\, \\text{days} = 1050 \\, \\text{calories}\n   \\]\nThus, Kendra would burn **1050 calories** shooting hoops for 30 minutes every day for one week.",
