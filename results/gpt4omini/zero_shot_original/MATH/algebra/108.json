        "To solve for \\( x \\) given the ratio of \\( x \\) to \\( y \\) is \\( 1:2 \\) and the equation \\( y = 4x - 36 \\), we can follow these steps:\n1. **Express the ratio mathematically**: Since the ratio \\( \\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{1}{2} \\), we can express \\( y \\) in terms of \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   y = 2x.\n   \\]\n2. **Substitute \\( y \\) into the equation**: Now, we can substitute \\( 2x \\) for \\( y \\) in the equation \\( y = 4x - 36 \\):\n   \\[\n   2x = 4x - 36.\n   \\]\n3. **Rearrange the equation**: Next, we can simplify the equation by moving all terms involving \\( x \\) to one side:\n   \\[\n   2x - 4x = -36 \\\\\n   -2x = -36.\n   \\]\n4. **Solve for \\( x \\)**: Dividing both sides by \\(-2\\) gives:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{-36}{-2} = 18.\n   \\]\n5. **Find \\( y \\)**: We can use the value of \\( x \\) to find \\( y \\):\n   \\[\n   y = 2x = 2 \\cdot 18 = 36.\n   \\]\n6. **Verify the ratio**: We should verify the original ratio:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{18}{36} = \\frac{1}{2},\n   \\]\n   which confirms the ratio holds.\nTherefore, the value of \\( x \\) is \\( \\boxed{18} \\).",
        "We are given the ratio of \\( x \\) to \\( y \\) as \\( 1:2 \\). This means we can express \\( y \\) in terms of \\( x \\) as follows:\n\\[\ny = 2x\n\\]\nWe are also provided with the equation:\n\\[\ny = 4x - 36\n\\]\nNow we have two expressions for \\( y \\). We can set them equal to each other:\n\\[\n2x = 4x - 36\n\\]\nNext, we will solve this equation for \\( x \\). First, we will get all the terms involving \\( x \\) on one side:\n\\[\n2x - 4x = -36\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n-2x = -36\n\\]\nNext, we multiply both sides by \\(-1\\):\n\\[\n2x = 36\n\\]\nNow, we solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides by \\( 2 \\):\n\\[\nx = \\frac{36}{2} = 18\n\\]\nThus, the value of \\( x \\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{18}\n\\]\nTo confirm our solution, we can find \\( y \\) using \\( y = 2x \\):\n\\[\ny = 2 \\times 18 = 36\n\\]\nNow we verify if this value of \\( y \\) satisfies the equation \\( y = 4x - 36 \\):\n\\[\ny = 4(18) - 36 = 72 - 36 = 36\n\\]\nSince both expressions for \\( y \\) give the same result, our solution is correct.
