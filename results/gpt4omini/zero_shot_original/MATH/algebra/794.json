        "To find a point that must be on the graph of \\( y = f(x) \\) given that the point \\( (4,7) \\) is on the graph of \\( y = 3f(2x) + 1 \\), we need to start by unraveling the given equation.\n1. **Identify the relationship**: The point \\( (4,7) \\) indicates that when \\( x = 4 \\), \\( y = 7 \\) for the function \\( y = 3f(2x) + 1 \\). This implies:\n   \\[\n   7 = 3f(2 \\cdot 4) + 1\n   \\]\n2. **Simplify the equation**: We can simplify the right-hand side:\n   \\[\n   7 = 3f(8) + 1\n   \\]\n   Subtracting 1 from both sides gives:\n   \\[\n   6 = 3f(8)\n   \\]\n3. **Solve for \\( f(8) \\)**: Dividing both sides by 3 yields:\n   \\[\n   f(8) = 2\n   \\]\n4. **Determine the point**: We now know that \\( f(8) = 2 \\), which gives us the point \\( (8, 2) \\) that is on the graph of \\( y = f(x) \\).\n5. **Find the sum of coordinates**: The coordinates of the point are \\( (8, 2) \\). The sum of the coordinates is:\n   \\[\n   8 + 2 = 10\n   \\]\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{10}\n\\]",
        "First, we are given that the point \\((4, 7)\\) is on the graph of the function \\(y = 3f(2x) + 1\\). This means that when \\(x = 4\\), the corresponding value of \\(y\\) is \\(7\\). We can express this mathematically as:\n\\[\n7 = 3f(2 \\cdot 4) + 1.\n\\]\nSimplifying this, we find:\n\\[\n7 = 3f(8) + 1.\n\\]\nNext, we isolate \\(f(8)\\):\n\\[\n7 - 1 = 3f(8) \\Rightarrow 6 = 3f(8) \\Rightarrow f(8) = \\frac{6}{3} = 2.\n\\]\nNow we know that \\(f(8) = 2\\). Since we need to find a point \\((a, b)\\) that must be on the graph of \\(y = f(x)\\), we can take:\n\\[\n(a, b) = (8, 2).\n\\]\nThe coordinates of this point are \\((8, 2)\\). We are asked for the sum of the coordinates \\(a + b\\):\n\\[\n8 + 2 = 10.\n\\]\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{10}.\n\\]",
        "Given the point \\((4, 7)\\) is on the graph of \\(y = 3f(2x) + 1\\), we know that when \\(x = 4\\), the y-coordinate becomes \\(7\\). \n1.

Now we have found that \\(f(8) = 2\\). This tells us that the point \\((8, 2)\\) is on the graph of \\(y = f(x)\\).\n3. To find the sum of the coordinates of the point \\((8, 2)\\), we simply add \\(8\\) and \\(2\\):\n   \\[\n   8 + 2 = 10.\n   \\]\nThus, the sum of the coordinates of that point is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",
        "We know that the point \\((4, 7)\\) is on the graph of \\(y = 3f(2x) + 1\\).
