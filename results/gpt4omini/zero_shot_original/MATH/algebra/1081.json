    "solution": "Since the problem only asks for the difference in the $x$-coordinates, we can ignore the $y$-coordinates.\nThey originally agreed to meet at the midpoint of $(3,5)$ and $(-6,2)$, so the $x$-coordinate of the planned location is $\\frac{3+(-6)}{2}=-\\frac{3}{2}$.\nThe correct meeting location should be at the midpoint of $(3,5)$ and $(-10,4)$, so the $x$-coordinate should be at $\\frac{3+(-10)}{2}=-\\frac{7}{2}$. The positive difference is $-\\frac{3}{2}-(-\\frac{7}{2})=\\boxed{2}$.\nAlternatively, notice that a 4-unit change in the $x$-coordinate of Barbara's location resulted in a 2-unit change in the midpoint since the 4 gets divided by 2. $\\frac{3+(-10)}{2}=\\frac{3+(-6)}{2}+\\frac{-4}{2}=-\\frac{3}{2}-\\boxed{2}$.",

        "To determine the locations where Annie and Barbara agree to meet and where they should actually meet, we first need to calculate the midpoints based on their respective coordinates.\n1. **Annie's Location**: Annie is located at \\( (3, 5) \\).\n2. **Assumed Location of Barbara**: Initially, Barbara claims to be at \\( (-6, 2) \\).\n3. **Calculate the Midpoint They Agreed to Meet**: \n   The formula for the midpoint \\((x_m, y_m)\\) between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   (x_m, y_m) = \\left( \\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \\right)\n   \\]\n   Plugging in Annie's and Barbara's assumed coordinates:\n   - For Anderson: \\( (x_1, y_1) = (3, 5) \\)\n   - For Barbara: \\( (x_2, y_2) = (-6, 2) \\)\n   Now, calculate the midpoint:\n   \\[\n   x_m = \\frac{3 + (-6)}{2} = \\frac{3 - 6}{2} = \\frac{-3}{2} = -1.5\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   y_m = \\frac{5 + 2}{2} = \\frac{7}{2} = 3.5\n   \\]\n   So, the midpoint they agreed to meet is \\( (-1.5, 3.5) \\).\n4. **Correct Location of Barbara**: The correct coordinate for Barbara after realizing she read the map wrong is \\( (-10, 4) \\).\n5. **Calculate the Actual Midpoint**:\n   Now, we need to calculate the midpoint using Annie\u2019s correct location and Barbara\u2019s actual location:\n   - Again, for Annie: \\( (x_1, y_1) = (3, 5) \\)\n   - For the correct Barbara: \\( (x_2, y_2) = (-10, 4) \\)\n   Now calculate the correct midpoint:\n   \\[\n   x_m' = \\frac{3 + (-10)}{2} = \\frac{3 - 10}{2} = \\frac{-7}{2} = -3.5\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   y_m' = \\frac{5 + 4}{2} = \\frac{9}{2} = 4.5\n   \\]\n   So, the actual midpoint where they should meet is \\( (-3.5, 4.5) \\).\n6. **Find the Positive Difference in the \\(x\\)-Coordinates**:\n   Now we calculate the positive difference in the \\(x\\)-coordinates of the agreed midpoint and the actual midpoint.\n   - The agreed \\(x\\)-coordinate is \\( -1.5 \\)\n   - The actual \\(x\\)-coordinate is \\( -3.5 \\)\n   The positive difference is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Difference} = |-1.5 - (-3.5)| = |-1.5 + 3.5| = |2| = 2\n   \\]\nThus, the positive difference in the \\(x\\)-coordinates where they agreed to meet and where they should actually meet is \\( \\boxed{2} \\).",
