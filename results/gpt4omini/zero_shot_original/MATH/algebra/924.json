        "The equation given is \\( y = x^2 - 6x + 13 \\). To find the minimum possible value of \\( y \\), we can rewrite the quadratic equation in a form that makes it easier to identify the vertex. We will complete the square.\n1. Begin with the quadratic equation:\n   \\[\n   y = x^2 - 6x + 13\n   \\]\n2. Identify the coefficient of \\( x \\), which is \\(-6\\). To complete the square, we take half of this coefficient and square it:\n   \\[\n   \\left(\\frac{-6}{2}\\right)^2 = 3^2 = 9\n   \\]\n3. Rewrite \\( y \\) by adding and subtracting 9:\n   \\[\n   y = (x^2 - 6x + 9) + 13 - 9\n   \\]\n4. This can be factored as follows:\n   \\[\n   y = (x - 3)^2 + 4\n   \\]\nNow, we know that the term \\((x - 3)^2\\) is always non-negative (i.e., \\((x - 3)^2 \\geq 0\\)). The minimum value of this squared term occurs when \\( x - 3 = 0 \\), which gives \\( (x - 3)^2 = 0 \\).\n5. When \\( (x - 3)^2 = 0 \\), we have:\n   \\[\n   y = 0 + 4 = 4\n   \\]\nThus, the minimum possible value for \\( y \\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{4}\n\\]\nThis minimum occurs when \\( x = 3 \\).",
        "To find the minimum possible value for \\( y \\) in the equation \n\\[\ny = x^2 - 6x + 13,\n\\]\nwe can complete the square.\n1. Start with the original equation:\n   \\[\n   y = x^2 - 6x + 13.\n   \\]\n2. Focus on the quadratic part, \\( x^2 - 6x \\). To complete the square, we need to rewrite it in the form \\( (x - h)^2 + k \\).\n3. Take the coefficient of \\( x \\), which is \\(-6\\), divide it by 2, and square it:\n   \\[\n   \\left(-\\frac{6}{2}\\right)^2 = (-3)^2 = 9.\n   \\]\n4. Add and subtract this value inside the equation:\n   \\[\n   y = (x^2 - 6x + 9) + 13 - 9.\n   \\]\n5. This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   y = (x - 3)^2 + 4.\n   \\]\nNow, notice that \\( (x - 3)^2 \\) is always non-negative (it is zero or positive), and it achieves its minimum value of 0 when \\( x - 3 = 0 \\) or \\( x = 3 \\).\n6. Therefore, the minimum value of \\( y \\) occurs when \\( (x - 3)^2 = 0 \\):\n   \\[\n   y = 0 + 4 = 4.\n   \\]\nHence, the minimum possible value for \\( y \\) is \n\\[\n\\boxed{4}.\n\\]",
        "To find the minimum possible value of \\( y \\) in the equation \n\\[\ny = x^2 - 6x + 13,\n\\]\nwe can start by recognizing that this is a quadratic equation in the standard form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\). Here, \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -6 \\), and \\( c = 13 \\).\n1. **Identify the vertex**: The vertex of a parabola defined by a quadratic function \\( y = ax^2 + bx + c \\) gives us the minimum (or maximum) value when \\( a > 0 \\) (which it is in this case, since \\( a = 1 \\)). The x-coordinate of the vertex can be found using the formula \n\\[\nx = -\\frac{b}{2a}.\n\\]\nSubstituting our values for \\( b \\) and \\( a \\):\n\\[\nx = -\\frac{-6}{2 \\cdot 1} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3.\n\\]\n2. **Calculate \\( y \\) at \\( x = 3 \\)**: Next, we substitute \\( x = 3 \\) back into the equation to find the corresponding \\( y \\)-value:\n\\[\ny = (3)^2 - 6(3) + 13.\n\\]\nCalculating each term:\n- \\( (3)^2 = 9 \\)\n- \\( -6(3) = -18 \\)\nPutting it all together:\n\\[\ny = 9 - 18 + 13 = 4.\n\\]\n3. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the minimum possible value for \\( y \\) is \n\\[\n\\boxed{4}.\n\\] \nWe confirmed that since the parabola opens upwards (indicated by \\( a > 0 \\)), the vertex indeed gives us the minimum value.  Thus, the final answer is \\( y = 4 \\) at \\( x = 3 \\).",
