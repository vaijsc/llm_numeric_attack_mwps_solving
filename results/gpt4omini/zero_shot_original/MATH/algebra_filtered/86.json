        "To evaluate \\(\\log_2 1\\), we need to recall the definition of logarithms. The logarithm \\(\\log_b a\\) is defined as the exponent \\(x\\) to which the base \\(b\\) must be raised to obtain \\(a\\). In other words:\n\\[\n\\log_b a = x \\quad \\text{if and only if} \\quad b^x = a\n\\]\nIn this case, we want to find \\(\\log_2 1\\). Therefore, we are looking for an \\(x\\) such that:\n\\[\n2^x = 1\n\\]\nWe know from the properties of exponents that any non-zero number raised to the power of 0 equals 1. That gives us:\n\\[\n2^0 = 1\n\\]\nThus, we can conclude that:\n\\[\nx = 0\n\\]\nHence, we have:\n\\[\n\\log_2 1 = 0\n\\]\nSo, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\]",
