    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Call the amount of money Larry has $a$ and the amount of money Lenny has $b$. We can use the following system of equations to represent the given information: \\begin{align*}\na + b &= 35 \\\\\na &= \\frac{2}{5} \\cdot b \\\\\n\\end{align*} Substituting for $a$ into the first equation gives $\\frac{2}{5} b + b = 35$. Solving for $b$ gives $\\frac{7}{5} b = 35$, or $b = 25$. Thus, $a = 35 - 25 = 10$. So Lenny has $25 - 10 = \\boxed{15}$ more dollars than Larry.",

        "Let \\( L \\) be the amount of money that Larry has, and let \\( N \\) be the amount of money that Lenny has. According to the problem, we know the following two things:\n1.

Larry has two-fifths of Lenny's amount:\n   \\[\n   L = \\frac{2}{5}N\n   \\]\nNow, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation.
