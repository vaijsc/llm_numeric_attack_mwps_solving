        "To solve this problem, we need to find the sum of the sums of all two-element subsets of the set \\(\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\).\nFirst, let's determine the two-element subsets of the set:\nThe set \\(\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\) has \\(6\\) elements. The number of two-element subsets (combinations) can be calculated using the formula:\n\\[\n\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\n\\]\nwhere \\(n\\) is the total number of elements in the set, and \\(k\\) is the size of the subset. Here, \\(n = 6\\) and \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{2} = \\frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \\frac{6 \\cdot 5}{2 \\cdot 1} = 15\n\\]\nThus, there are \\(15\\) two-element subsets.\nNext, we need to calculate the sum of the elements of all these subsets. Each pair \\(\\{a, b\\}\\) contributes a sum of \\(a + b\\).\nNow, each of the numbers \\(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\) will appear in multiple pairs. Specifically, each number \\(x \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\) appears in a combination with each of the other \\(5\\) numbers. Therefore, each number appears in \\(5\\) different two-element subsets.\nConsequently, the contribution of each number \\(x\\) to the total sum of sums is \\(5x\\).\nNow, let's compute the sum of the numbers in the set:\n\\[\n1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21\n\\]\nNow, we can find the contribution of all numbers combined:\n\\[\n\\text{Total Contribution} = 5 \\times (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6) = 5 \\times 21 = 105\n\\]\nSo, the sum of the sums of the elements of all the two-element subsets is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{105}\n\\]",

Each pair \\( \\{a, b\\} \\) in the subset contributes \\( a + b \\) to the total sum.\nEach element \\( i \\) in \\( S \\) appears in multiple subsets. Specifically, any element \\( i \\) appears in subsets formed with every other element \\( j \\) in the set that is greater than \\( i \\). For an element \\( i \\), the number of elements greater than \\( i \\) in \\( S \\) is \\( 6 - i \\). Thus, the contribution of each element \\( i \\) to the total sum of all two-element subset sums can be calculated as follows:\n1. The contribution of \\( i \\) to the total sum is the element \\( i \\) added to itself \\( 6 - i \\) times (each combination with a higher number).\n2. Therefore, the contribution of each individual element \\( i \\) can be expressed as \\( i(6 - i) \\) (since \\( i \\) appears in \\( 6 - i \\) pairs).\nTo find the total sum, we sum over all \\( i \\) from 1 to 6:\n\\[\n\\text{Total Sum} = \\sum_{i=1}^6 i(6 - i)\n\\]\nCalculating this explicitly, we have:\n- For \\( i = 1 \\): \\( 1(6 - 1) = 1 \\cdot 5 = 5 \\)\n- For \\( i = 2 \\): \\( 2(6 - 2) = 2 \\cdot 4 = 8 \\)\n- For \\( i = 3 \\): \\( 3(6 - 3) = 3 \\cdot 3 = 9 \\)\n- For \\( i = 4 \\): \\( 4(6 - 4) = 4 \\cdot 2 = 8 \\)\n- For \\( i = 5 \\): \\( 5(6 - 5) = 5 \\cdot 1 = 5 \\)\n- For \\( i = 6 \\): \\( 6(6 - 6) = 6 \\cdot 0 = 0 \\)\nThus, we calculate the total:\n\\[\n5 + 8 + 9 + 8 + 5 + 0 = 35\n\\]\nTherefore, the total contribution to the sum of all two-element subsets is \\( 35 \\).\nSince each pair is counted twice (once for \\( \\{i, j\\} \\) and once for \\( \\{j, i\\} \\)), we need to multiply by 2 to account for every sum of pairs correctly in both orders, leading to:\n\\[\n\\text{Relevant Total Contribution of pair sums} = 35\n\\]\nThus, the sum of the sums of the elements of these 15 two-element subsets is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{70}\n\\]",

Each element in the set can pair with \\(n - 1\\) other elements to form a two-element subset. Thus, each element appears in exactly \\(5\\) subsets because there are \\(6 - 1 = 5\\) other elements to pair with any given element.\nNow let's compute the contribution of each element to the total sum of all subset sums. Since each element appears in \\(5\\) two-element subsets, their contributions to the total sum can be calculated as follows:\n- The contributions of each individual element in the set \\(\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\):\n  - \\(1\\) contributes \\(5 \\times 1 = 5\\)\n  - \\(2\\) contributes \\(5 \\times 2 = 10\\)\n  - \\(3\\) contributes \\(5 \\times 3 = 15\\)\n  - \\(4\\) contributes \\(5 \\times 4 = 20\\)\n  - \\(5\\) contributes \\(5 \\times 5 = 25\\)\n  - \\(6\\) contributes \\(5 \\times 6 = 30\\)\nNow, we can find the total contribution by summing all contributions:\n\\[\n5 + 10 + 15 + 20 + 25 + 30\n\\]\nCalculating this gives:\n\\[\n5 + 10 = 15\n\\]\n\\[\n15 + 15 = 30\n\\]\n\\[\n30 + 20 = 50\n\\]\n\\[\n50 + 25 = 75\n\\]\n\\[\n75 + 30 = 105\n\\]\nThus, the sum of the contributions from all elements is \\(105\\).
