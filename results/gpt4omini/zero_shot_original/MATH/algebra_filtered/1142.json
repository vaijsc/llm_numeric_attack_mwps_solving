        "To solve this problem, let's begin by setting up the equations based on the given rectangular formations and the conditions stated.\n1. **First Rectangle Dimensions**: The band is in a rectangular formation with dimensions \\( n-2 \\) and \\( n + 8 \\). The total number of members can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   (n-2)(n+8)\n   \\]\n2. **Second Rectangle Dimensions**: In the second stage, they re-arrange into a rectangle of dimensions \\( n \\) and \\( 2n - 3 \\). The total number of members in this arrangement, excluding drummers, can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   n(2n-3)\n   \\]\n3. **Relationship Between the Two Arrangements**: Since the total number of members must remain the same, we can set these two expressions equal to each other. Adding a variable \\( d \\) to represent the number of drummers:\n   \\[\n   (n-2)(n+8) = n(2n-3) + d\n   \\]\n   Since we are told there are at least 4 drummers:\n   \\[\n   d \\geq 4\n   \\]\n4. **Expanding Both Sides**:\n   - Expanding the left side:\n     \\[\n     (n-2)(n+8) = n^2 + 8n - 2n - 16 = n^2 + 6n - 16\n     \\]\n   - Expanding the right side:\n     \\[\n     n(2n - 3) = 2n^2 - 3n\n     \\]\n5. **Setting Up the Equation**:\n   Substituting the expansions back into the equation yields:\n   \\[\n   n^2 + 6n - 16 = 2n^2 - 3n + d\n   \\]\n   Rearranging gives:\n   \\[\n   n^2 - 9n + 16 + d = 0\n   \\]\n   This can be rearranged as:\n   \\[\n   d = -n^2 + 9n - 16\n   \\]\n6. **Finding Values of n**: To find valid values of \\( n \\), we need \\( d \\geq 4 \\):\n   \\[\n   -n^2 + 9n - 16 \\geq 4\n   \\]\n   Simplifying gives:\n   \\[\n   -n^2 + 9n - 20 \\geq 0\n   \\]\n   or\n   \\[\n   n^2 - 9n + 20 \\leq 0\n   \\]\n7. **Factoring the Quadratic**:\n   The quadratic \\( n^2 - 9n + 20 \\) can be factored as:\n   \\[\n   (n-4)(n-5) \\leq 0\n   \\]\n   The roots of this equation are \\( n = 4 \\) and \\( n = 5 \\).\n8. **Finding the Interval**: To determine where the inequality holds, we analyze the intervals:\n   - Test \\( n < 4 \\): (e.g., \\( n=3 \\)) results in positive.\n   - Test \\( 4 \\leq n \\leq 5 \\): Choose \\( 4.5 \\) which results in negative.\n   - Test \\( n > 5 \\): (e.g., \\( n=6 \\)) results in positive.\n   Hence, the solution to \\( (n-4)(n-5) \\leq 0 \\) indicates that \\( n \\) must lie in the interval:\n   \\[\n   4 \\leq n \\leq 5\n   \\]\n9. **Checking Values of n**:\n   - For \\( n = 4 \\):\n     \\[\n     d = -4^2 + 9(4) - 16 = -16 + 36 - 16 = 4 \\quad (\\text{Valid})\n     \\]\n   - For \\( n = 5 \\):\n     \\[\n     d = -5^2 + 9(5) - 16 = -25 + 45 - 16 = 4 \\quad (\\text{Valid})\n     \\]\n10. **Calculating the Final Sum**:\n   The valid values of \\( n \\) are \\( 4 \\) and \\( 5 \\). Thus, the sum of all possible values of \\( n \\) is:\n   \\[\n   4 + 5 = 9\n   \\]\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{9}\n\\]",
        "To solve for the possible values of \\( n \\) in the given marching band formation problem, we first need to understand the situation with the total number of members who are not drummers.\n### Step 1: Calculate the total number of band members\nIn the first formation, the dimensions are \\( n - 2 \\) (rows) and \\( n + 8 \\) (columns). Therefore, the total number of band members is:\n\\[\n(n - 2)(n + 8)\n\\]\nExpanding this:\n\\[\n(n - 2)(n + 8) = n^2 + 8n - 2n - 16 = n^2 + 6n - 16\n\\]\n### Step 2: Calculate the total number of members excluding drummers\nIn the second formation, the dimensions are \\( n \\) (rows) and \\( 2n - 3 \\) (columns). Hence, the total number of members excluding the drummers is:\n\\[\nn(2n - 3) = 2n^2 - 3n\n\\]\n### Step 3: Establish the relationship between total members and non-drummers\nThe total number of members is equal to the number of non-drummers plus the number of drummers. If we let \\( d \\) represent the number of drummers, we have:\n\\[\nn^2 + 6n - 16 = 2n^2 - 3n + d\n\\]\n### Step 4: Rearranging the equation\nRearranging this equation gives:\n\\[\n0 = 2n^2 - 3n + d - n^2 - 6n + 16\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n0 = n^2 - 9n + d + 16\n\\]\n### Step 5: Analyze the equation for integer solutions\nRearranging it further gives:\n\\[\nd = -n^2 + 9n - 16\n\\]\nSince we know that there are at least 4 drummers, we set the inequality:\n\\[\n-n^2 + 9n - 16 \\geq 4\n\\]\n### Step 6: Solve for \\( n \\)\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n-n^2 + 9n - 20 \\geq 0\n\\]\nMultiplying through by -1 (and changing the inequality direction):\n\\[\nn^2 - 9n + 20 \\leq 0\n\\]\nFactoring the quadratic gives:\n\\[\n(n - 4)(n - 5) \\leq 0\n\\]\n### Step 7: Determine the intervals for \\( n \\)\nThe roots of the equation are 4 and 5. The quadratic expression is less than or equal to 0 between these roots, hence:\n\\[\n4 \\leq n \\leq 5\n\\]\n### Step 8: List possible integer values of \\( n \\)\nThe possible integer values of \\( n \\) are \\( 4 \\) and \\( 5 \\). \n### Step 9: Calculate the sum of all possible values of \\( n \\)\nCalculating the sum:\n\\[\n4 + 5 = 9\n\\]\n### Conclusion\nThus, the sum of all possible values of \\( n \\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{9}\n\\]",
        "To solve the problem, let's first denote the total number of members in the band as \\( N \\). Given that the band forms a rectangular formation with dimensions \\( n-2 \\) and \\( n + 8 \\), we can express \\( N \\) as:\n\\[\nN = (n - 2)(n + 8)\n\\]\nExpanding this gives:\n\\[\nN = n^2 + 8n - 2n - 16 = n^2 + 6n - 16\n\\]\nNext, in the second stage, the band members re-arrange to form a different rectangle with dimensions \\( n \\) and \\( 2n - 3 \\), excluding all the drummers. Let \\( d \\) denote the number of drummers. The total number of non-drummers in this stage is:\n\\[\nN - d = n(2n - 3) = 2n^2 - 3n\n\\]\nConsequently, we have the following equation linking \\( N \\) and \\( d \\):\n\\[\nN - d = (n^2 + 6n - 16) - d = 2n^2 - 3n\n\\]\nRearranging this gives:\n\\[\nn^2 + 6n - 16 - d = 2n^2 - 3n\n\\]\nThis can be simplified to:\n\\[\nn^2 - 9n + 16 - d = 0\n\\]\nFrom this equation, we can express \\( d \\):\n\\[\nd = n^2 - 9n + 16\n\\]\nGiven that there are at least 4 drummers, we set up the following inequality:\n\\[\nn^2 - 9n + 16 \\geq 4\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\nn^2 - 9n + 12 \\geq 0\n\\]\nNext, we can factor the quadratic:\n\\[\nn^2 - 9n + 12 = (n - 3)(n - 4)\n\\]\nTo solve the inequality \\( (n - 3)(n - 4) \\geq 0 \\), we need to determine where this product is non-negative.
