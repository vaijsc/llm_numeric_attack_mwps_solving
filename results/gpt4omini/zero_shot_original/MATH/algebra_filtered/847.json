        "To determine how many meters Caroline will walk in exactly one hour according to the linear relationship indicated by the graph, we can analyze the information given in the problem.\n1. The problem states that the graph passes through the point (20, 30). This means that after 20 seconds, Caroline is 30 meters from her starting point.\n2.

        "To determine how far Caroline will walk in one hour, we first need to analyze the given information about her walking distance and time.
