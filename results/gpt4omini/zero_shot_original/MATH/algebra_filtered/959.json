        "Let the two numbers be \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). We know from the problem statement:\n1. \\( x + y = 3 \\)\n2. The difference of the squares of the numbers can be expressed as \\( x^2 - y^2 = 33 \\).\nWe can use the identity for the difference of squares, which states that \\( x^2 - y^2 = (x-y)(x+y) \\). \nFrom equation (1), we have:\n\\[\nx + y = 3\n\\]\nSubstituting into the difference of squares equation:\n\\[\nx^2 - y^2 = (x-y)(x+y) = (x - y)(3)\n\\]\nThus, we can rewrite equation (2):\n\\[\n(x - y) \\cdot 3 = 33\n\\]\nNow, we can isolate \\( x - y \\) by dividing both sides by \\( 3 \\):\n\\[\nx - y = \\frac{33}{3} = 11\n\\]\nNow we need to find the absolute value of the difference of the two numbers, which is:\n\\[\n|x - y| = |11| = 11\n\\]\nTo confirm our solution, we can find the individual values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).

The sum: \\( 7 + (-4) = 3 \\), which is correct.\n2. The difference of the squares:\n\\[\n7^2 - (-4)^2 = 49 - 16 = 33\n\\]\nBoth conditions are satisfied.
