    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let $t$ equal the amount of time David worked. Therefore, Alan worked $3t$ hours. They placed a total of $30 \\cdot t +30 \\cdot 3t=600$ bricks. Solving for $t$, we find that $t=5$ hours. Therefore, David placed $30 \\cdot 5 = \\boxed{150}$ bricks.",

        "Let's denote the number of hours David worked as \\( d \\). Since Alan worked three times as many hours as David, we can denote the number of hours Alan worked as \\( 3d \\).\nBoth bricklayers place bricks at a rate of 30 bricks per hour. Thus, we can calculate the total number of bricks each bricklayer laid.\n**For David:**\nThe total number of bricks David laid:\n\\[\n\\text{Bricks laid by David} = 30 \\text{ bricks/hour} \\times d \\text{ hours} = 30d\n\\]\n**For Alan:**\nThe total number of bricks Alan laid:\n\\[\n\\text{Bricks laid by Alan} = 30 \\text{ bricks/hour} \\times 3d \\text{ hours} = 90d\n\\]\nNow, we know the total number of bricks laid by both Alan and David is 600 bricks:\n\\[\n30d + 90d = 600\n\\]\nCombining the terms:\n\\[\n120d = 600\n\\]\nNext, we solve for \\( d \\):\n\\[\nd = \\frac{600}{120} = 5\n\\]\nNow that we have determined how many hours David worked, we can find out how many bricks he laid:\n\\[\n\\text{Bricks laid by David} = 30d = 30 \\times 5 = 150\n\\]\nTherefore, the number of bricks David laid is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{150}\n\\]",
        "Let's denote the number of hours David worked as \\( x \\). Since Alan worked three times as many hours as David, Alan worked \\( 3x \\) hours.\nNow, we know that both Alan and David can place 30 bricks per hour. Therefore, the number of bricks placed by each bricklayer can be calculated as follows:\n- David's brick placement:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Bricks placed by David} = 30 \\text{ bricks/hour} \\times x \\text{ hours} = 30x \\text{ bricks}\n  \\]\n- Alan's brick placement:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Bricks placed by Alan} = 30 \\text{ bricks/hour} \\times 3x \\text{ hours} = 90x \\text{ bricks}\n  \\]\nThe total number of bricks laid by both is 600. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[\n30x + 90x = 600\n\\]\nCombining like terms:\n\\[\n120x = 600\n\\]\nNow, we can solve for \\( x \\):\n\\[\nx = \\frac{600}{120} = 5\n\\]\nSo, David worked for \\( x = 5 \\) hours. To find out how many bricks David laid, we can substitute \\( x \\) back into the equation for the number of bricks he laid:\n\\[\n\\text{Bricks placed by David} = 30x = 30 \\times 5 = 150 \\text{ bricks}\n\\]\nThus, the number of bricks laid by David is \\( \\boxed{150} \\).",
        "Let's denote the number of hours David worked as \\( x \\). \nSince Alan worked three times as many hours as David, we can express Alan's working hours as \\( 3x \\).\nNext, we know both of them lay bricks at the same rate, which is 30 bricks per hour. \nNow we can calculate the total number of bricks layered by each bricklayer:\n- **Bricks laid by David**:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Bricks by David} = 30 \\text{ bricks/hour} \\times x \\text{ hours} = 30x\n  \\]\n- **Bricks laid by Alan**:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Bricks by Alan} = 30 \\text{ bricks/hour} \\times 3x \\text{ hours} = 90x\n  \\]\nAdding both quantities gives the total number of bricks laid:\n\\[\n\\text{Total bricks} = \\text{Bricks by David} + \\text{Bricks by Alan} = 30x + 90x = 120x\n\\]\nAccording to the problem, the total number of bricks placed is 600. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\\[\n120x = 600\n\\]\nNow, solving for \\( x \\):\n\\[\nx = \\frac{600}{120} = 5\n\\]\nSo, David worked for 5 hours. Now we can determine how many bricks David laid:\n\\[\n\\text{Bricks laid by David} = 30x = 30 \\times 5 = 150\n\\]\nThus, the number of bricks that David laid is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{150}\n\\]",
        "Let's solve the problem step by step.\n1. **Define Variables**:\n   - Let \\( h \\) be the number of hours David worked.\n   - Since Alan worked three times as many hours as David, he worked \\( 3h \\) hours.\n2. **Determine the Rate of Bricks Laid**:\n   - Both Alan and David lay 30 bricks per hour.\n3. **Calculate Total Bricks Laid**:\n   - The number of bricks laid by David can be calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Bricks by David} = 30 \\times h\n     \\]\n   - The number of bricks laid by Alan can be calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Bricks by Alan} = 30 \\times (3h) = 90h\n     \\]\n4. **Set Up the Equation**:\n   - Together, they laid a total of 600 bricks. We can set up the equation:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Bricks by David} + \\text{Bricks by Alan} = 600\n     \\]\n     Substituting the expressions we have:\n     \\[\n     30h + 90h = 600\n     \\]\n5. **Combine Like Terms**:\n   - Combine the terms on the left side:\n     \\[\n     120h = 600\n     \\]\n6. **Solve for \\( h \\)**:\n   - Dividing both sides by 120 gives:\n     \\[\n     h = \\frac{600}{120} = 5\n     \\]\n7. **Calculate Bricks Laid by David**:\n   - Now that we have \\( h \\), we can find out how many bricks David laid:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Bricks by David} = 30h = 30 \\times 5 = 150\n     \\]\n8. **Conclusion**:\n   - Therefore, David laid **150 bricks**.",
        "Let's start by defining the variables based on the problem:\n- Let \\( h \\) be the number of hours David worked.\n- Since Alan worked three times as many hours as David, Alan worked \\( 3h \\) hours.\nNow, we know both bricklayers place bricks at the same rate of 30 bricks per hour. \n1. **Calculate the total number of bricks laid by David:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Bricks laid by David} = \\text{Rate} \\times \\text{Hours worked by David} = 30 \\times h = 30h\n   \\]\n2. **Calculate the total number of bricks laid by Alan:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Bricks laid by Alan} = \\text{Rate} \\times \\text{Hours worked by Alan} = 30 \\times (3h) = 90h\n   \\]\n3. **Total bricks laid by both:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total bricks} = \\text{Bricks laid by David} + \\text{Bricks laid by Alan} = 30h + 90h = 120h\n   \\]\nAccording to the problem, the total number of bricks placed by the two bricklayers is 600.
