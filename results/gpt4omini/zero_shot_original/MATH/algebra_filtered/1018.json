        "To calculate how many years it will take to recuperate the costs of the new green technology, we need to consider the installation cost, the annual maintenance cost, and the annual savings from energy bills.\n1. **Initial Installation Cost**: This is a one-time cost of \\$10,000.\n   \n2. **Annual Maintenance Cost**: This costs \\$650 each year.\n3. **Annual Savings**: The technology saves you \\$1,200 each year on energy bills.\nNext, we need to determine the net annual savings we gain from the technology:\n\\[\n\\text{Net Annual Savings} = \\text{Annual Savings} - \\text{Annual Maintenance Cost}\n\\]\nSubstituting the values we have:\n\\[\n\\text{Net Annual Savings} = 1200 - 650 = 550\n\\]\nSo, each year, you effectively save \\$550 after covering the maintenance costs.\nNow, we need to find out how many years it will take to recuperate the initial installation cost of \\$10,000 using these net annual savings:\n\\[\n\\text{Years to Recuperate Costs} = \\frac{\\text{Initial Installation Cost}}{\\text{Net Annual Savings}}\n\\]\nSubstituting the values:\n\\[\n\\text{Years to Recuperate Costs} = \\frac{10000}{550}\n\\]\nCalculating this gives:\n\\[\n\\text{Years to Recuperate Costs} \\approx 18.18\n\\]\nSince we are looking for whole years, we round up because it is impractical to think in terms of partial years for cost recuperation. Thus, it will take **19 whole years** to recuperate the costs. \nSo, the answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{19}\n\\]",
        "Let's break down the costs and savings step by step:\n1. **Initial installation cost**: The one-time installation cost is $10,000.\n2. **Annual maintenance cost**: Each year, there is a maintenance cost of $650.\n3. **Annual savings**: The green technology saves $1,200 each year in energy bills.\nNext, let's calculate the net savings each year:\n- **Net savings in the first year**:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Net savings} = \\text{Annual savings} - \\text{Annual maintenance cost}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  = 1200 - 650 = 550\n  \\]\nThis means in the first year, the net savings will be $550.\nNow, to determine how many years it will take to recover the initial installation cost of $10,000:\n- The net savings for subsequent years will also be $550 (since the maintenance cost and savings remain constant).\n- The total savings over the years can be expressed as:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Total savings after } n \\text{ years} = n \\times \\text{Net savings per year}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  = n \\times 550\n  \\]\nWe want to find \\( n \\) such that:\n\\[\nn \\times 550 \\geq 10,000\n\\]\nTo find \\( n \\):\n\\[\nn \\geq \\frac{10,000}{550}\n\\]\nCalculating this gives:\n\\[\nn \\geq \\frac{10,000}{550} \\approx 18.18\n\\]\nSince \\( n \\) has to be a whole number, we round up to the nearest whole number, which gives us \\( n = 19 \\).\nThus, it will take **19 whole years** to recuperate the costs of the green technology.",
        "To determine how many whole years it will take to recuperate the costs of the new green technology, we need to consider both the one-time installation cost and the annual maintenance expenses against the savings on energy bills.\n1. **Initial Costs**:\n   - One-time installation cost: \\(\\$10,000\\)\n   - Annual maintenance cost: \\(\\$650\\)\n2. **Annual Savings**:\n   - Annual savings from energy bills: \\(\\$1,200\\)\n3. **Net Annual Benefit**:\n   To find the net annual benefit, we subtract the annual maintenance cost from the annual savings:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Net annual benefit} = \\text{Annual savings} - \\text{Annual maintenance cost}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Net annual benefit} = 1200 - 650 = 550\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the net benefit gained each year from the technology is \\(\\$550\\).\n4. **Time to Recoup Costs**:\n   Next, we want to calculate how many years it will take to cover the initial cost of \\(\\$10,000\\) with the net annual benefit of \\(\\$550\\):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Years to recuperate} = \\frac{\\text{Initial cost}}{\\text{Net annual benefit}} = \\frac{10000}{550}\n   \\]\n   Performing the division:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{10000}{550} \\approx 18.18\n   \\]\n5. **Rounding to Whole Years**:\n   Since we need to find the number of whole years, we round up from \\(18.18\\) to \\(19\\) years, because you cannot recuperate a fraction of a year in practical terms.\nThus, the total number of whole years required to recuperate the costs is \\(\\boxed{19}\\).",
        "To determine how many whole years it will take to recuperate the costs of installing the green technology, we need to analyze the total costs and savings over time.\n1. **Initial Installation Cost**: The upfront cost for the technology is \\(\\$10,000\\).\n2. **Annual Maintenance Costs**: The maintenance cost incurred every year after installation is \\(\\$650\\).\n3. **Annual Savings**: The energy savings generated by the technology each year is \\(\\$1200\\).\nNext, we calculate the net savings each year:\n\\[\n\\text{Net Savings per Year} = \\text{Annual Savings} - \\text{Annual Maintenance Costs}\n\\]\n\\[\n= 1200 - 650 = 550\n\\]\nThis net saving of \\(\\$550\\) represents the amount saved each year after accounting for maintenance costs.\nNow, we need to figure out how many years it will take to recover the \\(\\$10,000\\) installation cost with the net savings:\nLet \\( n \\) be the number of years it takes to recuperate the costs. The total amount saved after \\( n \\) years can be represented as:\n\\[\n\\text{Total Savings} = n \\times \\text{Net Savings per Year} = n \\times 550\n\\]\nWe want this amount to be equal to the initial installation cost, so we set up the equation:\n\\[\nn \\times 550 = 10000\n\\]\nNow, solving for \\( n \\):\n\\[\nn = \\frac{10000}{550} \\approx 18.18\n\\]\nSince we are looking for whole years, we round up to the next whole number, because we need to ensure the entire installation cost is covered. Thus, \\( n = 19 \\).\nTherefore, it will take approximately \\( \\boxed{19} \\) whole years to recuperate the costs of installing the new green technology.",
        "To determine how many years it will take to recuperate the costs of the new green technology, we first need to identify the total costs and savings associated with it.\n1. **Initial Installation Cost**: This is a fixed amount of \\$10,000.\n2. **Annual Maintenance Cost**: This costs \\$650 per year.\n3. **Annual Savings**: The technology is expected to save \\$1,200 each year in energy bills.\nNext, we calculate the **net savings per year** by subtracting the annual maintenance cost from the annual savings.\n\\[\n\\text{Net Savings per Year} = \\text{Annual Savings} - \\text{Annual Maintenance Cost}\n\\]\nSubstituting the values:\n\\[\n\\text{Net Savings per Year} = 1200 - 650 = 550\n\\]\nNow we need to find out how many years it will take to recuperate the initial installation cost of \\$10,000 by using the net savings per year.\nTo do this, we calculate the number of years required to recover the initial cost:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of Years} = \\frac{\\text{Initial Installation Cost}}{\\text{Net Savings per Year}}\n\\]\nSubstituting the values:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of Years} = \\frac{10000}{550} \\approx 18.18\n\\]\nSince we need the number of **whole years**, we round up to the next whole number, as partial years do not count in this context.\nSo, it will take approximately **19 whole years** to recuperate all the costs associated with the green technology. \nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{19}\n\\]"
