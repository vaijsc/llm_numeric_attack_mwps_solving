    "solution": "The common difference in this arithmetic sequence is $987 - 1000= -13$, so the $n^{\\text{th}}$ term in this sequence is $1000 - 13(n - 1) = 1013 - 13n$.  This expression is positive if and only if $1013 - 13n > 0$, or \\[n < \\frac{1013}{13} = 77 + \\frac{12}{13}.\\] Since $n$ must be a positive integer, $n \\le 77$.  Hence, the least positive integer in this sequence corresponds to the value $n = 77$, in which case $1013 - 13n = 1013 - 13 \\cdot 77 = \\boxed{12}$.",

        "To find the least positive integer in the arithmetic sequence given as \\(1000, 987, 974, 961, \\ldots\\), we first need to identify a few properties of this sequence.\n1. **Identify the first term and the common difference**:\n   - The first term \\(a_1 = 1000\\).\n   - The second term \\(a_2 = 987\\).\n   - We can calculate the common difference \\(d\\) by finding the difference between the first and second term:\n     \\[\n     d = a_2 - a_1 = 987 - 1000 = -13.\n     \\]\n   - Thus, \\(d = -13\\).\n2. **General term of the sequence**:\n   - The \\(n\\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence can be expressed as:\n     \\[\n     a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d.\n     \\]\n   - Plugging in our values:\n     \\[\n     a_n = 1000 + (n-1)(-13).\n     \\]\n   - This simplifies to:\n     \\[\n     a_n = 1000 - 13(n-1).\n     \\]\n   - Expanding this gives:\n     \\[\n     a_n = 1000 - 13n + 13 = 1013 - 13n.\n     \\]\n3. **Finding the least positive integer in the sequence**:\n   - We need to find the least integer \\(n\\) such that \\(a_n > 0\\).\n   - Set the inequality:\n     \\[\n     1013 - 13n > 0.\n     \\]\n   - Solving this for \\(n\\):\n     \\[\n     1013 > 13n \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad n < \\frac{1013}{13}.\n     \\]\n   - Now calculating \\( \\frac{1013}{13} \\):\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1013}{13} \\approx 77.1538.\n     \\]\n   - Since \\(n\\) must be a positive integer, the maximum integer value for \\(n\\) is \\(77\\).\n4. **Calculating the \\(77\\)-th term**:\n   - Substitute \\(n = 77\\) back into the formula for \\(a_n\\):\n     \\[\n     a_{77} = 1013 - 13 \\times 77 = 1013 - 1001 = 12.\n     \\]\n5. **Check \\(n = 78\\)**:\n   - Let's calculate \\(a_{78}\\) to confirm that it is not positive:\n     \\[\n     a_{78} = 1013 - 13 \\times 78 = 1013 - 1014 = -1.\n     \\]\n   - This confirms that \\(n = 78\\) produces a non-positive term.\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The least positive integer in the sequence is thus:\n     \\[\n     \\boxed{12}.\n     \\]",
