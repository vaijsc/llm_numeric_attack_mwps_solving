        "To determine how many sticks of butter are needed for the cookies, we first need to find out how many pans of cookies Walter and Gretel must bake to meet the requirement of 216 cookies.\n1. **Calculate the number of cookies per recipe**: Each pan of the recipe yields 15 cookies.\n2. **Calculate the number of pans needed**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of pans} = \\frac{\\text{Total cookies needed}}{\\text{Cookies per pan}} = \\frac{216}{15}\n   \\]\n   Performing the division:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{216}{15} = 14.4\n   \\]\n   Since they can only make whole pans, they need to round up to the nearest whole number, which is 15 pans.\n3. **Calculate the amount of butter needed for 15 pans**: The recipe requires 3 tablespoons of butter per pan.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total tablespoons of butter} = \\text{Pans} \\times \\text{Butter per pan} = 15 \\times 3 = 45 \\text{ tablespoons}\n   \\]\n4. **Convert tablespoons to sticks**: There are 8 tablespoons in a stick of butter.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total sticks of butter} = \\frac{\\text{Total tablespoons}}{8} = \\frac{45}{8}\n   \\]\n   Performing the division:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{45}{8} = 5.625\n   \\]\n   Since they cannot buy a fraction of a stick, we round up to the nearest whole number, which gives us 6 sticks of butter.\n5. **Final Conclusion**: Walter and Gretel will need **6 sticks of butter** to bake enough cookies.",

        "To determine how many pans of cookies Walter and Gretel will need to bake, we start by calculating the total number of cookies required for the students:\n1. **Total Cookies Needed**: \n   Each of the 108 students is expected to eat an average of 2 cookies.
