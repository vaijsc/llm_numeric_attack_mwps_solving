    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let the smallest of these consecutive integers be $a-3$, and thus the largest will be $a+3$. The sum of all seven  integers is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, which is $7a = 49$. Thus, $a=7$. The smallest of the seven integers is $a-3=7-3=\\boxed{4}$.",

        "To find the smallest of seven consecutive integers that sum to 49, we can first represent the seven consecutive integers. Let's denote the smallest integer as \\( x \\). The seven consecutive integers can then be expressed as:\n- \\( x \\) (the smallest)\n- \\( x + 1 \\)\n- \\( x + 2 \\)\n- \\( x + 3 \\)\n- \\( x + 4 \\)\n- \\( x + 5 \\)\n- \\( x + 6 \\)\nNext, we can set up the equation for the sum of these integers:\n\\[\nx + (x + 1) + (x + 2) + (x + 3) + (x + 4) + (x + 5) + (x + 6) = 49\n\\]\nNow, let's combine like terms:\n\\[\n7x + (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6) = 49\n\\]\nCalculating the sum of the numbers from 1 to 6:\n\\[\n1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21\n\\]\nNow we can substitute this back into the equation:\n\\[\n7x + 21 = 49\n\\]\nNext, we isolate the term with \\( x \\) by subtracting 21 from both sides:\n\\[\n7x = 49 - 21\n\\]\n\\[\n7x = 28\n\\]\nNow, we divide both sides by 7 to solve for \\( x \\):\n\\[\nx = \\frac{28}{7} = 4\n\\]\nThus, the smallest of the seven consecutive integers is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{4}\n\\]\nFinally, we can verify our result by listing the integers and checking the sum:\nThe integers are: \\( 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 \\).\nCalculating the sum:\n\\[\n4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 49\n\\]\nThis confirms that our calculations were correct, and the smallest integer is indeed \\( \\boxed{4} \\).",
