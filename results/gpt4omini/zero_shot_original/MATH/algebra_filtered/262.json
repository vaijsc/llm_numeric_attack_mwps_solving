    "solution": "The given function has a domain of all real numbers if and only if the denominator is never equal to zero.  In other words, the quadratic $x^2 + 4x + c = 0$ has no real roots.  The discriminant of this quadratic is $16 - 4c$.  The quadratic has no real roots if and only if the discriminant is negative, so $16 - 4c < 0$, or $c > 4$.
