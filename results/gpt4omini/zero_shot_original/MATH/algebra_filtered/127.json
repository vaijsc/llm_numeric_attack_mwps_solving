        "To find the power of 4 that is equal to 8, we can represent this using the equation:\n\\[\n4^x = 8\n\\]\nNext, we can express both sides of the equation with the same base. We know that \\(4\\) can be written as \\(2^2\\), and \\(8\\) can be written as \\(2^3\\). Thus, we have:\n\\[\n(2^2)^x = 2^3\n\\]\nUsing the power of a power property, we can simplify the left side of the equation:\n\\[\n2^{2x} = 2^3\n\\]\nSince the bases are the same, we can equate the exponents:\n\\[\n2x = 3\n\\]\nNow, we can solve for \\(x\\) by dividing both sides by 2:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{3}{2}\n\\]\nThus, the power of 4 that is equal to 8 is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}\n\\]",
        "To find what power of 4 is equal to 8, we can express this as an equation:\n\\[\n4^x = 8\n\\]\nNext, we'll use logarithms to solve for \\(x\\). We can take the logarithm of both sides. Here, we'll use the base 4 logarithm:\n\\[\n\\log_4(4^x) = \\log_4(8)\n\\]\nUsing the property of logarithms that states \\(\\log_b(a^c) = c \\cdot \\log_b(a)\\):\n\\[\nx = \\log_4(8)\n\\]\nNext, we need to express 8 in terms of base 4. We know that:\n\\[\n8 = 2^3\n\\]\nNow we can rewrite 8 in terms of base 4:\n\\[\n4 = 2^2 \\Rightarrow 4^x = (2^2)^x = 2^{2x}\n\\]\nPutting this back into our equation:\n\\[\n2^{2x} = 2^3\n\\]\nSince the bases are the same, we can set the exponents equal to each other:\n\\[\n2x = 3\n\\]\nNow we solve for \\(x\\):\n\\[\nx = \\frac{3}{2}\n\\]\nThus, the power of 4 that is equal to 8 is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}\n\\]",
        "To find what power of \\( 4 \\) is equal to \\( 8 \\), we can set up the equation:\n\\[\n4^x = 8\n\\]\nNext, we can express both sides of the equation with a common base.
