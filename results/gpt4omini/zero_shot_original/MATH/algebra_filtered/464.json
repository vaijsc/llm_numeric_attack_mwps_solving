        "We start with the equation given in the problem:\n\\[\n6^x + 6^x + 6^x + 6^x + 6^x + 6^x = 6^6\n\\]\nOn the left side, we notice that there are six identical terms, each equal to \\(6^x\\). Therefore, we can simplify this by adding the six terms together:\n\\[\n6 \\cdot 6^x = 6^6\n\\]\nNext, we can simplify the left side further. The expression \\(6 \\cdot 6^x\\) can be rewritten using properties of exponents. Specifically, we have:\n\\[\n6^1 \\cdot 6^x = 6^{x+1}\n\\]\nThus, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\\[\n6^{x+1} = 6^6\n\\]\nSince the bases on both sides of the equation are the same (both are powers of 6), we can equate the exponents:\n\\[\nx + 1 = 6\n\\]\nNow, we solve for \\(x\\) by isolating it:\n\\[\nx = 6 - 1\n\\]\n\\[\nx = 5\n\\]\nFinally, we conclude that the value of \\(x\\) is \n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]",
