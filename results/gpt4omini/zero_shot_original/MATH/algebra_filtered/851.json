    "solution": "We start with $125 = 5^3$ cans. After recycling these cans, we will have made $125\\cdot\\frac15 = 5^2$ new cans. We can then recycle these new cans to make $5^2\\cdot\\frac15 = 5$ new cans and then finally recycle these to make $5\\cdot \\frac15 = 1$ new can. So the total number of new cans is $5^2+5+1 = 25+5+1 = \\boxed{31}$.",

        "To determine how many new cans can be made from 125 aluminum cans, we'll calculate the process step by step, considering that every five recycled cans yield one new can.\n1. **First Round Recycling:**\n   - Start with 125 cans.\n   - For every 5 cans, 1 new can is created.\n   - Formula: \\( \\text{New Cans} = \\frac{\\text{Old Cans}}{5} \\)\n   - Calculate the first set of new cans:\n     \\[\n     \\text{New Cans} = \\frac{125}{5} = 25\n     \\]\n   - Now we have 25 new cans.\n2. **Second Round Recycling:**\n   - We can recycle the 25 new cans.\n   - Again, for every 5 cans, 1 new can is created.\n   - Calculate the second set of new cans:\n     \\[\n     \\text{New Cans} = \\frac{25}{5} = 5\n     \\]\n   - Now we have 5 additional new cans.\n3. **Third Round Recycling:**\n   - We can recycle these 5 new cans.\n   - Calculate the third set of new cans:\n     \\[\n     \\text{New Cans} = \\frac{5}{5} = 1\n     \\]\n   - Now we have 1 additional new can.\n4. **Final Round Recycling:**\n   - We have 1 can left, and we cannot recycle it into a new can since we need 5 cans to create 1 new can. \n5. **Summing It All Up:**\n   - Total new cans made:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total New Cans} = 25 + 5 + 1 = 31\n     \\]\nThus, the total number of new cans that can eventually be made from 125 aluminum cans is **31**.",
        "Let's break down the process step by step:\n1. **Initial Count**: We start with 125 aluminum cans.\n2. **First Recycling**: We can make new cans from the initial 125 cans.

Therefore, we stop here.\n6. **Total Count**: We now sum the total number of new cans produced:\n   - First recycling: 25 new cans\n   - Second recycling: 5 new cans\n   - Third recycling: 1 new can\n   - Total = 25 + 5 + 1 = 31 new cans.\nSo, the total number of new cans that can eventually be made from 125 aluminum cans is **31 new cans**.",

        "To find out how many new cans can eventually be made from 125 aluminum cans, we need to consider the recycling process step by step.\n1. **Initial recycling of 125 cans**: \n   Since 5 aluminum cans can be recycled to make 1 new can, we start by dividing the original number of cans by 5:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{125}{5} = 25\n   \\]\n   So, from the initial 125 cans, we can make 25 new cans.\n2. **Recycling the new cans**:\n   We can now recycle these 25 new cans. Again, we divide by 5 to see how many new cans we can make from these:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{25}{5} = 5\n   \\]\n   Therefore, from the 25 new cans, we can create 5 more new cans.\n3. **Recycling the next set of new cans**:\n   Next, we recycle the 5 new cans:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{5}{5} = 1\n   \\]\n   From the 5 new cans, we can create 1 more new can.\n4. **Recycling the last new can**:\n   Finally, we attempt to recycle the 1 new can we just created:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{5} = 0.2\n   \\]\n   Since we cannot make any new cans from less than 5 cans, this last recycling step cannot yield another new can.\n5. **Total number of new cans created**:\n   Now, we add up all the new cans we have created from each round of recycling:\n   - From the first round: 25 new cans\n   - From the second round: 5 new cans\n   - From the third round: 1 new can\n   Adding these together gives us:\n   \\[\n   25 + 5 + 1 = 31\n   \\]\nTherefore, the total number of new cans that can eventually be made from 125 aluminum cans is **31**.",
        "To determine how many new cans can be made from 125 aluminum cans through recycling, we need to follow a step-by-step process.\n1. **Initial Cans**: We start with 125 aluminum cans.\n   \n2. **First Recycling Round**: We know that it takes 5 aluminum cans to make 1 new can. Therefore, we can calculate how many new cans we can make from the initial 125 cans by dividing 125 by 5:\n   \\[\n   \\text{New cans from initial} = \\frac{125}{5} = 25\n   \\]\n   So, we can create 25 new cans from the original 125 cans.\n3. **Second Recycling Round**: Now, we can recycle these 25 new cans.

Since we need 5 cans to make another new can, and we only have 1 can, we cannot create any more new cans. \n6. **Total New Cans**: To find the total number of new cans made, we sum the new cans produced in each round:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total new cans} = 25 \\text{ (first round)} + 5 \\text{ (second round)} + 1 \\text{ (third round)} = 31\n   \\]\nThus, the total number of new cans that can eventually be made from 125 aluminum cans is **31**."
