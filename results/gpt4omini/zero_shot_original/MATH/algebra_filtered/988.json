        "To find the 2003rd term of the sequence of odd numbers, we start by defining the sequence. The sequence of odd numbers can be expressed as follows:\n1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ...\nEach term in this sequence can be represented using the formula:\n\\[\na_n = 2n - 1\n\\]\nwhere \\( a_n \\) is the \\( n \\)-th term of the sequence. The term corresponds to its position \\( n \\). \nTo find the 2003rd term, we substitute \\( n = 2003 \\) into the formula:\n\\[\na_{2003} = 2 \\cdot 2003 - 1\n\\]\nNow we calculate:\n\\[\n2 \\cdot 2003 = 4006\n\\]\nThen, we subtract 1:\n\\[\n4006 - 1 = 4005\n\\]\nThus, the 2003rd term of the sequence of odd numbers is \n\\[\n\\boxed{4005}\n\\]",
        "To find the 2003rd term of the sequence of odd numbers, we start by identifying the pattern of the sequence.\nThe sequence of odd numbers begins as follows:\n1st term: 1  \n2nd term: 3  \n3rd term: 5  \n4th term: 7  \n5th term: 9  \n... and so on.\nWe can observe that the \\( n \\)-th term of the sequence of odd numbers can be expressed by the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Odd}(n) = 2n - 1\n\\]\nThis means that to find the n-th odd number, we can simply substitute \\( n \\) into the formula.\nFor our specific case, we need to find the 2003rd term. We will substitute \\( n = 2003 \\) into our formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Odd}(2003) = 2 \\times 2003 - 1\n\\]\nNow we perform the calculation:\n\\[\n2 \\times 2003 = 4006\n\\]\nThus,\n\\[\n\\text{Odd}(2003) = 4006 - 1 = 4005\n\\]\nTherefore, the 2003rd term of the sequence of odd numbers is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{4005}\n\\]",
        "The sequence of odd numbers starts at 1 and continues as follows: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ...\nThis sequence can be represented mathematically by the formula for the \\(n\\)-th odd number, which is given by:\n\\[\na_n = 2n - 1\n\\]\nwhere \\(n\\) is the term number in the sequence.\nTo find the 2003rd term of the sequence, we simply substitute \\(n = 2003\\) into the formula:\n\\[\na_{2003} = 2 \\times 2003 - 1\n\\]\nNow, calculating this:\n\\[\n2 \\times 2003 = 4006\n\\]\n\\[\na_{2003} = 4006 - 1 = 4005\n\\]\nTherefore, the 2003rd term of the sequence of odd numbers is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{4005}\n\\]",
        "To find the 2003rd term of the sequence of odd numbers, we start by identifying how the sequence is structured. The sequence of odd numbers can be expressed mathematically. \nThe sequence starts at 1 and increases by 2 for each subsequent term. Therefore, we can express the \\( n \\)-th odd number using the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{n-th odd number} = 2n - 1\n\\]\nNow, we plug in \\( n = 2003 \\) into this formula to find the 2003rd term:\n\\[\n\\text{2003rd odd number} = 2 \\times 2003 - 1\n\\]\nNext, we perform the multiplication:\n\\[\n2 \\times 2003 = 4006\n\\]\nNow, we subtract 1 from this result:\n\\[\n4006 - 1 = 4005\n\\]\nThus, the 2003rd term of the sequence of odd numbers is \n\\[\n\\boxed{4005}\n\\]",
        "The sequence of odd numbers starts as follows: 1, 3, 5, 7, ...\nWe can observe that the \\( n \\)-th term of this sequence can be formulated. Specifically, the \\( n \\)-th odd number can be represented by the expression:\n\\[\na_n = 2n - 1\n\\]\nTo confirm this, we can check the first few terms:\n- For \\( n = 1 \\): \\( a_1 = 2 \\times 1 - 1 = 1 \\)\n- For \\( n = 2 \\): \\( a_2 = 2 \\times 2 - 1 = 3 \\)\n- For \\( n = 3 \\): \\( a_3 = 2 \\times 3 - 1 = 5 \\)\n- For \\( n = 4 \\): \\( a_4 = 2 \\times 4 - 1 = 7 \\)\nThis clearly aligns with our sequence of odd numbers. Now, to find the 2003rd term of the sequence, we simply substitute \\( n = 2003 \\) into our formula:\n\\[\na_{2003} = 2 \\times 2003 - 1\n\\]\nCalculating this gives:\n\\[\na_{2003} = 4006 - 1 = 4005\n\\]\nThus, the 2003rd term of the sequence of odd numbers is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{4005}\n\\]"
