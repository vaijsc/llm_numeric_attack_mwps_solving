        "To solve the inequality \\(\\frac{1}{5}|9 + 2a| < 1\\), we can start by eliminating the fraction. Multiply both sides by 5 (which is a positive number, so we don't change the inequality):\n\\[\n|9 + 2a| < 5\n\\]\nNow we can break down the absolute value inequality into two separate inequalities:\n\\[\n-5 < 9 + 2a < 5\n\\]\nNow we will solve these two inequalities separately.\n1. **First Inequality:**\n   \\[\n   -5 < 9 + 2a\n   \\]\n   Subtract 9 from both sides:\n   \\[\n   -5 - 9 < 2a\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   -14 < 2a\n   \\]\n   Now, divide by 2:\n   \\[\n   -7 < a\n   \\]\n   or\n   \\[\n   a > -7\n   \\]\n2. **Second Inequality:**\n   \\[\n   9 + 2a < 5\n   \\]\n   Subtract 9 from both sides:\n   \\[\n   2a < 5 - 9\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   2a < -4\n   \\]\n   Now, divide by 2:\n   \\[\n   a < -2\n   \\]\nNow we can combine both results:\n\\[\n-7 < a < -2\n\\]\nIn interval notation, this is expressed as:\n\\[\n(-7, -2)\n\\]\nThus, the solution for \\(a\\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{(-7, -2)}\n\\]",

The statement \\(|x| < b\\) translates to \\(-b < x < b\\).
