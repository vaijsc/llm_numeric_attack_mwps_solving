        "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the integers 2 through 9 in the eight smallest triangles formed in the squares such that the pairs of integers in each of the four squares have the same sum.\n### Step 1: Understanding the arrangement\nLet's label the four corners of the squares as follows:\n- Square 1 (top left corner): Triangles are labeled as \\( a \\) (top triangle) and \\( b \\) (bottom right triangle).\n- Square 2 (top right corner): Triangles are labeled as \\( c \\) (top triangle) and \\( d \\) (bottom left triangle).\n- Square 3 (bottom left corner): Triangles are labeled as \\( e \\) (top triangle) and \\( f \\) (bottom right triangle).\n- Square 4 (bottom right corner): Triangles are labeled as \\( g \\) (top triangle) and \\( h \\) (bottom left triangle).\n### Step 2: Identifying pairs\nThe pairs of triangles in each square can be summarized as follows:\n1. Square 1: Pairs \\( (a, b) \\)\n2. Square 2: Pairs \\( (c, d) \\)\n3. Square 3: Pairs \\( (e, f) \\)\n4. Square 4: Pairs \\( (g, h) \\)\n### Step 3: Setting up the equations\nThe requirement states that the sum of pairs in each square must be equal:\n\\[\na + b = c + d = e + f = g + h = S\n\\]\nwhere \\( S \\) is the common sum for all pairs.\n### Step 4: Calculate the total sum\nThe total of integers from 2 to 9 is calculated as:\n\\[\n2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 44\n\\]\nSince we have four squares each defined by two pairs:\n\\[\nS + S + S + S = 4S\n\\]\nThis means the total can also be expressed as:\n\\[\n4S = 44\n\\]\n### Step 5: Solving for \\( S \\)\nTo find \\( S \\), we divide the total sum by 4:\n\\[\nS = \\frac{44}{4} = 11\n\\]\n### Conclusion\nThe required sum for the pairs of integers in each of the squares is \\(\\boxed{11}\\).",
        "We start by observing the structure of the figure provided, which consists of four squares that overlap to form smaller triangles at their corners. Each integer from 2 to 9 must be placed in the eight smallest triangles.\nLet's denote the integers as \\( a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h \\) corresponding to each triangle. Our goal is to determine the sum for the pairs of integers in the four formed squares, where each square's sum must be equal.\nThe integers to be used are \\( 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 \\), and their total sum is calculated as follows:\n\\[\n2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 44\n\\]\nEach square is formed by two triangles, which allows us to find pairs of integers. We need to define the pairs of triangles contributing to each square\u2019s sum based on the arrangement of triangles in the squares.\nLet\u2019s assume the triangles are positioned in the squares as follows:\n- Square 1 and Square 2 share sides with Triangle \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).\n- Square 3 and Square 4 share sides with Triangle \\( C \\) and \\( D \\).\nTo match the square pairs, we can notionally identify the sums:\n- Square 1: \\( A + B \\)\n- Square 2: \\( C + D \\)\nFor these to have the same sum \\( S \\):\n\\[\nA + B = C + D = S\n\\]\nHere\u2019s the breakdown of how we can think about the sums in detail:\n- If \\( A + B = S \\) and \\( C + D = S \\), then we can express the total sum conditioned by this layout.\n- Since the integers can be paired in different triangles but must yield equal sums, let's perform a systematic arrangement of the pairs to reveal \\( S \\).\nThe equations of the triangle sums combined should yield:\n\\[\nA + B + C + D = \\text{Total Sum} - \\text{(unused integers)}\n\\]\nSince all integers from 2 to 9 are being used, let's distribute the total into pairs.\nTo explore values of \\( S \\):\n1. Pairing smaller and larger integers is a strategy.\n2. The combinations of pairs that will yield similar sums must average out correctly.\nThe middle point or average sum of these pairs helps define \\( S \\):\nIf we take \\( 2, 9 \\), \\( 3, 8 \\), \\( 4, 7 \\), \\( 5, 6 \\)\u2014each of these pairs adds up to:\n\\[\n2 + 9 = 11 \\\\\n3 + 8 = 11 \\\\\n4 + 7 = 11 \\\\\n5 + 6 = 11\n\\]\nThus, every formed square can equal a sum of \\( 11 \\) when arranged correctly. Ensuring all triangles across squares are populated correctly will respect these conditions.\nIn doing so, we verify:\n\\[\n\\text{Each Square\u2019s sum } S = 11.\n\\]\nThus, the final result with correct pairs leading to equal sums is:\n\\[\n\\textbf{The required sum for each square is } \\boxed{11}.\n\\]",
        "To solve the problem, we need to understand how the integers 2 through 9 can be arranged in the figure while ensuring that the pairs of integers in each of the four smallest squares have the same sum.\n### Step 1: Identify the pairs per square\nThe figure consists of two overlapping squares that together create four smaller squares:\n- The top left square\n- The top right square\n- The bottom left square\n- The bottom right square\nEach square contains two of the eight integers, and since there are four squares, we will have four pairs of integers.

If four pairs yield the same sum, and there are 4 pairs (2 numbers in each square, thus 8 numbers total), we can express this as:\n\\[\n4S = \\text{Total sum of the integers}\n\\]\n\\[\n4S = 44\n\\]\nTo find \\( S \\), we divide by 4:\n\\[\nS = \\frac{44}{4} = 11\n\\]\n### Step 4: Confirm pairs can sum to \\( S = 11 \\)\nNow we must find pairs of integers from 2 to 9 that sum to 11:\n- Pair one: \\( 2 + 9 = 11 \\)\n- Pair two: \\( 3 + 8 = 11 \\)\n- Pair three: \\( 4 + 7 = 11 \\)\n- Pair four: \\( 5 + 6 = 11 \\)\nThese pairs utilize all integers from 2 through 9 exactly once. \n### Conclusion\nThe sum for each of the pairs in the squares thus is \\( \\boxed{11} \\).

        "To solve the problem, we need to assign the integers 2 through 9 to the small triangles within the squares in such a way that the sums of the pairs in each of the squares are equal. \nLet's start by understanding the layout of the figure.
