        "To solve the equation \\(\\sqrt{3x - 5} = 2\\), we start by squaring both sides to eliminate the square root.\n1. Square both sides:\n   \\[\n   (\\sqrt{3x - 5})^2 = 2^2\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   3x - 5 = 4\n   \\]\n2. Next, we solve for \\(x\\) by isolating it on one side of the equation. First, add 5 to both sides:\n   \\[\n   3x - 5 + 5 = 4 + 5\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   3x = 9\n   \\]\n3. Now, divide both sides by 3 to find \\(x\\):\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{9}{3} = 3\n   \\]\nWe have found a potential solution \\(x = 3\\). Now, we need to check if this value satisfies the original equation.\n4. Substitute \\(x = 3\\) back into the original equation:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{3(3) - 5} = \\sqrt{9 - 5} = \\sqrt{4} = 2\n   \\]\n   Since the left side equals the right side, \\(x = 3\\) is indeed a solution.\n5. Therefore, the final solution for the equation \\(\\sqrt{3x - 5} = 2\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{3}\n   \\]",
