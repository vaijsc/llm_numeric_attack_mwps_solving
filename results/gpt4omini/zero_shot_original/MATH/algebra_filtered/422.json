    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let the length of the playground be $l$ and the width be $w$. We have the equation $2l+2w=200 \\Rightarrow l + w = 100$. We want to maximize the area of this rectangular playground, which is given by $lw$. From our equation, we know that $l=100-w$. Substituting this in to our expression for area, we have \\[(100-w)(w)=100w-w^2\\]We will now complete the square to find the maximum value of this expression. Factoring a $-1$ out, we have \\[-(w^2-100w)\\]In order for the expression inside the parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(100/2)^2=2500$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we get \\[-(w^2-100w+2500-2500) \\Rightarrow -(w-50)^2+2500\\]Since the maximum value of $-(w-50)^2$ is 0 (perfect squares are always nonnegative), the maximum value of the entire expression is 2500, which is achieved when $w=50$ and $l=100-w=50$ (the playground is a square). Thus, the maximum area of the playground is $\\boxed{2500}$ square feet.",

        "To find the maximum area of a rectangular playground that can be enclosed with 200 feet of fencing, we start by recalling some basic geometric principles.\n### Step 1: Set up the perimeter\nFor a rectangle, the perimeter \\( P \\) is given by the formula:\n\\[\nP = 2L + 2W\n\\]\nwhere \\( L \\) is the length and \\( W \\) is the width of the rectangle. In this problem, the total perimeter is 200 feet, so we have:\n\\[\n2L + 2W = 200\n\\]\nWe can simplify this by dividing the entire equation by 2:\n\\[\nL + W = 100\n\\]\n### Step 2: Express the area\nThe area \\( A \\) of the rectangle is given by:\n\\[\nA = L \\times W\n\\]\nTo express area in terms of a single variable, we can use the relationship from the perimeter. From \\( L + W = 100 \\), we can express \\( W \\) in terms of \\( L \\):\n\\[\nW = 100 - L\n\\]\nNow, substitute \\( W \\) back into the area formula:\n\\[\nA = L \\times (100 - L)\n\\]\nExpanding this, we get:\n\\[\nA = 100L - L^2\n\\]\n### Step 3: Find the maximum area\nThe equation \\( A = 100L - L^2 \\) is a quadratic equation in standard form \\( A = -L^2 + 100L \\). The graph of this quadratic equation is a downward-opening parabola, and its maximum occurs at the vertex.\nThe vertex \\( L \\) of a parabola given by the formula \\( A = ax^2 + bx + c \\) can be found using:\n\\[\nL = -\\frac{b}{2a}\n\\]\nIn our case, \\( a = -1 \\) and \\( b = 100 \\):\n\\[\nL = -\\frac{100}{2 \\times -1} = \\frac{100}{2} = 50\n\\]\n### Step 4: Calculate corresponding width\nSubstituting \\( L = 50 \\) back into the equation for \\( W \\):\n\\[\nW = 100 - L = 100 - 50 = 50\n\\]\n### Step 5: Calculate the area\nNow we can find the maximum area:\n\\[\nA = L \\times W = 50 \\times 50 = 2500 \\text{ square feet}\n\\]\n### Conclusion\nThe maximum area of the rectangular playground that can be enclosed with 200 feet of fencing is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2500} \\text{ square feet}\n\\]",
