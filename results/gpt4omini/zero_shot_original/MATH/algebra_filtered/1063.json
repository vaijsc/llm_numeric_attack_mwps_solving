        "To solve the equation \\(2 - 3iz = 3 + 2iz\\), we will isolate \\(z\\) step by step.\n1. Start by rewriting the equation:\n   \\[\n   2 - 3iz = 3 + 2iz\n   \\]\n2. Let's move all terms involving \\(z\\) to one side and constant terms to the other side. First, add \\(3iz\\) to both sides:\n   \\[\n   2 = 3 + 2iz + 3iz\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   2 = 3 + 5iz\n   \\]\n3. Next, subtract 3 from both sides:\n   \\[\n   2 - 3 = 5iz\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   -1 = 5iz\n   \\]\n4. Now, divide both sides by \\(5i\\) to solve for \\(z\\):\n   \\[\n   z = \\frac{-1}{5i}\n   \\]\n5. To simplify \\(\\frac{-1}{5i}\\), multiply the numerator and the denominator by \\(-i\\) (the complex conjugate of \\(i\\)):\n   \\[\n   z = \\frac{-1 \\cdot (-i)}{5i \\cdot (-i)} = \\frac{i}{-5i^2}\n   \\]\n   Since \\(i^2 = -1\\), we have:\n   \\[\n   -5i^2 = -5(-1) = 5\n   \\]\n   Thus, the equation simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   z = \\frac{i}{5}\n   \\]\n6. Therefore, the solution for \\(z\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{\\frac{i}{5}}\n   \\]",
