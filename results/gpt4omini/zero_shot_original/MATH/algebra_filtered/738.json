        "To determine how much more Pam pays than Susan for the tickets, we need to calculate the total amounts each person spends after applying their respective discounts.\n1. **Calculate the cost for Susan:**\n   - The full price of one ticket is $20.\n   - Susan buys 4 tickets.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost before discount} = 4 \\times 20 = 80 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n   - Susan has a coupon for a 25% discount.
