        "To determine the number of vertical asymptotes for the function \\( y = \\frac{2}{x^2 + x - 6} \\), we first need to identify when the function is undefined, which occurs when the denominator equals zero. Therefore, we need to solve the equation:\n\\[\nx^2 + x - 6 = 0.\n\\]\nNext, we can factor the quadratic expression. We need to find two numbers that multiply to \\(-6\\) (the constant term) and add up to \\(1\\) (the coefficient of \\(x\\)). The numbers \\(3\\) and \\(-2\\) fit this requirement:\n\\[\nx^2 + x - 6 = (x - 2)(x + 3).\n\\]\nNow, we can set each factor equal to zero to find the values of \\(x\\) that will make the denominator zero:\n\\[\nx - 2 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = 2,\n\\]\n\\[\nx + 3 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = -3.\n\\]\nThus, the function \\( y = \\frac{2}{x^2+x-6} \\) is undefined at \\( x = 2 \\) and \\( x = -3 \\). Both of these points correspond to vertical asymptotes in the graph of the function.\nNow we count the number of vertical asymptotes:\n- One at \\( x = 2 \\),\n- One at \\( x = -3 \\).\nTherefore, the graph of \\( y = \\frac{2}{x^2+x-6} \\) has a total of:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]\nvertical asymptotes.",
