        "The function \\( f(x) = \\sqrt{x^2} \\) can be simplified using the properties of square roots. For any real number \\( x \\), the expression \\( \\sqrt{x^2} \\) returns the non-negative value of \\( |x| \\). Consequently, we can rewrite the function as:\n\\[\nf(x) = |x|\n\\]\nNext, we analyze the behavior of the absolute value function \\( |x| \\):\n1. The absolute value function outputs only non-negative values. Specifically:\n   - For \\( x \\geq 0 \\), \\( |x| = x \\).\n   - For \\( x < 0 \\), \\( |x| = -x \\), which is still non-negative.\n2. Since \\( |x| \\geq 0 \\) for all real numbers \\( x \\), the minimum value of \\( f(x) \\) is 0, occurring at \\( x = 0 \\).\n3. As \\( x \\) increases or decreases without bound (i.e., as \\( |x| \\to \\infty \\)), the function \\( |x| \\) also increases without bound.\nTaking these points into account, we conclude that the range of \\( f(x) = |x| \\) is all non-negative values:\n\\[\n\\text{Range of } f(x) = [0, \\infty)\n\\]\nThus, the final answer for the range of the function \\( f(x) = \\sqrt{x^2} \\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{[0, \\infty)}\n\\]",

        "To find the range of the function \\( f(x) = \\sqrt{x^2} \\), we will first simplify the expression for the function.\n1. **Understanding the square root function**:\n   The expression \\( \\sqrt{x^2} \\) represents the principal square root of \\( x^2 \\). By definition, the square root function outputs only non-negative values.\n2. **Simplifying \\( \\sqrt{x^2} \\)**:\n   For any real number \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{x^2} = |x|\n   \\]\n   where \\( |x| \\) is the absolute value of \\( x \\).

The expression \\( x^2 \\) is always non-negative for all real numbers \\( x \\) because squaring any real number results in a non-negative value.\n2. **Evaluating \\( \\sqrt{x^2} \\)**:\n   The square root of a squared value can be simplified. In particular, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{x^2} = |x|\n   \\]\n   This transformation tells us that \\( f(x) = \\sqrt{x^2} \\) is equivalent to the absolute value function, denoted as \\( |x| \\).\n3. **Determining the output of \\( |x| \\)**:\n   The absolute value function \\( |x| \\) takes any real number \\( x \\) and outputs its non-negative counterpart.

As \\( x \\) approaches positive or negative infinity, \\( |x| \\) also approaches positive infinity. Therefore, the function does cover all non-negative values.\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   The overall conclusion about the range of the function \\( f(x) = \\sqrt{x^2} \\) is that it includes all values greater than or equal to 0.\nThus, the range of the function \\( f(x) = \\sqrt{x^2} \\) is:\n\\[\n\\text{Range} = [0, \\infty)\n\\]"
