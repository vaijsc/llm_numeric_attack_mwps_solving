        "To determine how many cells there are at the end of 15 days, we will analyze the splitting process of the cells.\n1. **Initial Condition**: The organism starts with 2 cells.\n2. **Splitting Cycle**: Every 3 days, each cell splits into 2 cells. \n   - At the end of the first 3 days:\n     - Starting with 2 cells, each cell splits:\n     - New total: \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\) cells.\n   - At the end of the next 3 days (6 days total):\n     - Starting with 4 cells, each cell splits:\n     - New total: \\(4 \\times 2 = 8\\) cells.\n   - At the end of the next 3 days (9 days total):\n     - Starting with 8 cells, each cell splits:\n     - New total: \\(8 \\times 2 = 16\\) cells.\n   - At the end of the next 3 days (12 days total):\n     - Starting with 16 cells, each cell splits:\n     - New total: \\(16 \\times 2 = 32\\) cells.\n   - At the end of the next 3 days (15 days total):\n     - Starting with 32 cells, each cell splits:\n     - New total: \\(32 \\times 2 = 64\\) cells.\nNow, let's summarize:\n- Day 0: 2 cells\n- Day 3: 4 cells\n- Day 6: 8 cells\n- Day 9: 16 cells\n- Day 12: 32 cells\n- Day 15: 64 cells\nThus, at the end of the 15th day, the total number of cells is \\(\\boxed{64}\\).",
        "To solve the problem, we need to analyze how many cells exist after each period of 3 days, given that each cell splits into two cells at the end of each 3-day period.\n1. **Initial Cells**: We begin with 2 cells.\n  \n2. **Splitting Logic**: Every 3 days, each cell splits into two new cells.
