        "Given the equation \n\\[\n(x-p)(x-q) = (r-p)(r-q),\n\\]\nwe know that one solution is \\( x = r \\). Let's substitute \\( x = r \\) into the equation:\n\\[\n(r-p)(r-q) = (r-p)(r-q).\n\\]\nThis confirms that \\( x = r \\) is a solution. \nNext, we set up the equation for the solutions. We can rewrite the left side as a polynomial:\n\\[\n(x-p)(x-q) = x^2 - (p+q)x + pq.\n\\]\nAnd the right side \n\\[\n(r-p)(r-q) = r^2 - (p+q)r + pq.\n\\]\nNow, equating both sides gives us:\n\\[\nx^2 - (p+q)x + pq = r^2 - (p+q)r + pq.\n\\]\nNext, we will simplify this:\n\\[\nx^2 - (p+q)x = r^2 - (p+q)r.\n\\]\nNow, rearranging this gives:\n\\[\nx^2 - (p+q)x - r^2 + (p+q)r = 0.\n\\]\nThis is a quadratic equation in the variable \\( x \\). We can use the quadratic formula to find its solutions:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-(b) \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a},\n\\]\nwhere \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -(p+q) \\), and \\( c = -r^2 + (p+q)r \\).\nThus, we have:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{(p+q) \\pm \\sqrt{(p+q)^2 - 4(1)(-r^2 + (p+q)r)}}{2(1)}.\n\\]\nThis can be simplified further:\n1. Calculate the discriminant:\n\\[\n(p+q)^2 - 4(-r^2 + (p+q)r) = (p+q)^2 + 4r^2 - 4(p+q)r.\n\\]\n2. Introducing constants \\( d = (p+q) \\):\nThen the expression simplifies to:\n\\[\nd^2 + 4r^2 - 4dr.\n\\]\n3. Returning to our quadratic solution:\nSince we already know one solution \\( x = r \\), we can find the second solution (let's denote it as \\( x_2 \\)) as follows. The sum of the solutions of the equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\) is given by \n\\[\n-\\frac{b}{a} = p + q.\n\\]\nHence,\n\\[\nr + x_2 = p + q,\n\\]\nwhich allows us to solve for \\( x_2 \\):\n\\[\nx_2 = (p + q) - r.\n\\]\nThus, the other solution in terms of \\( p \\), \\( q \\), and \\( r \\) is \n\\[\n\\boxed{p + q - r}.\n\\]",

We need to find the other solution.\n### Step 1: Substitute \\( x = r \\)\nWe substitute \\( x = r \\) into the left side of the equation:\n\\[\n(r-p)(r-q) = (r-p)(r-q)\n\\]\nThis confirms that \\( x = r \\) satisfies the equation since both sides are equal.\n### Step 2: Expand both sides\nLet's expand both sides of the original equation:\nThe left-hand side expands to:\n\\[\n(x-p)(x-q) = x^2 - (p+q)x + pq\n\\]\nThe right-hand side is:\n\\[\n(r-p)(r-q) = r^2 - (p+q)r + pq\n\\]\n### Step 3: Set the equation\nNow we can set both sides of the equation equal to each other:\n\\[\nx^2 - (p+q)x + pq = r^2 - (p+q)r + pq\n\\]\n### Step 4: Simplify\nSubtract \\( pq \\) from both sides:\n\\[\nx^2 - (p+q)x = r^2 - (p+q)r\n\\]\nRearranging gives us:\n\\[\nx^2 - (p+q)x - (r^2 - (p+q)r) = 0\n\\]\n### Step 5: Factor the quadratic equation\nSince \\( x = r \\) is one solution, we can express the quadratic as:\n\\[\n(x - r)(x - s) = 0\n\\]\nHere, \\( s \\) is the other root we want to find. Expand this expression:\n\\[\nx^2 - (r + s)x + rs = 0\n\\]\n### Step 6: Compare coefficients\nComparing this with our earlier expanded form \\( x^2 - (p+q)x + pq \\), we find:\n1.

From the constant terms:\n   \\[\n   rs = pq \n   \\]\n   which helps to confirm the relationship.\n### Final Result\nThe other solution is therefore:\n\\[\n\\boxed{(p + q) - r}\n\\]",
        "Given the equation \\((x - p)(x - q) = (r - p)(r - q)\\), we know that one solution is \\(x = r\\).\nTo find the other solution, we first evaluate the right-hand side at \\(x = r\\):\n\\[\n(r - p)(r - q)\n\\]\nThus, substituting \\(x = r\\) into the left-hand side:\n\\[\n(r - p)(r - q) = (r - p)(r - q)\n\\]\nThis confirms that \\(x = r\\) satisfies the equation. Now, we want to rewrite the original equation in a form that will allow us to find the other solution.\nFirst, we rearrange the equation as follows:\n\\[\n(x - p)(x - q) - (r - p)(r - q) = 0\n\\]\nLet us define a new function:\n\\[\nf(x) = (x - p)(x - q) - (r - p)(r - q)\n\\]\nSince we know that \\(x = r\\) is one root of the equation \\(f(x) = 0\\), we can factor \\(f(x)\\) using \\(x - r\\):\n\\[\nf(x) = (x - r)(x - s)\n\\]\nwhere \\(s\\) is the other root we want to find.
