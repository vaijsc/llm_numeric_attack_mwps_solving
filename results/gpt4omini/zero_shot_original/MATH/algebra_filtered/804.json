    "solution": "Let the number of quarters in the first, second, third, and fourth piles be $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$, respectively. We have the equations \\begin{align*} \\tag{1}\na+b+c+d&=27\\\\ \\tag{2}\na&=b-5\\\\ \\tag{3}\nb&=c+4\\\\ \\tag{4}\nd&=3b\n\\end{align*} We want to find the value of $d$. We will express each of $a$, $b$, and $c$ in terms of $d$ and then substitute these equations into Equation (1) to find the value of $d$. From Equation (4), we have $b=d/3$. From Equation (3), we have $c=b-4$. Since $b=d/3$, we can rewrite Equation (3) as $c=d/3-4$. We can substitute $b=d/3$ into Equation (2) to get $a=d/3-5$. Substituting $b=d/3$, $c=d/3-4$, and $a=d/3-5$ into Equation (1) to eliminate $a$, $b$, and $c$, we get $(d/3-5)+d/3+(d/3-4)+d=27$, so $d=18$. Thus, there are $\\boxed{18}$ quarters in the fourth pile.",

        "Let's denote the number of quarters in the four piles as follows:\n- Let \\( x \\) be the number of quarters in the first pile.\n- Let \\( y \\) be the number of quarters in the second pile.\n- Let \\( z \\) be the number of quarters in the third pile.\n- Let \\( w \\) be the number of quarters in the fourth pile.\nFrom the problem, we have the following relationships:\n1. The first pile has 5 fewer than the second pile:  \n   \\[ x = y - 5 \\]\n2. The second pile has 4 more than the third pile:  \n   \\[ y = z + 4 \\]\n3.

The total number of quarters in all four piles is 27:  \n   \\[ x + y + z + w = 27 \\]\nNow, we can substitute the values of \\( x \\), \\( z \\), and \\( w \\) in terms of \\( y \\) into the total equation. \nSubstituting \\( x \\) and \\( z \\):\nGiven \\( y = z + 4 \\) we can express \\( z \\) as:\n\\[ z = y - 4 \\]\nSubstituting \\( z \\) and \\( x \\) in the total equation:\n\\[\n(y - 5) + y + (y - 4) + (3y) = 27\n\\]\nNow simplify the equation:\n\\[\ny - 5 + y + y - 4 + 3y = 27\n\\]\n\\[\n6y - 9 = 27\n\\]\nNow, add 9 to both sides:\n\\[\n6y = 36\n\\]\nDivide both sides by 6:\n\\[\ny = 6\n\\]\nNow we can find the number of quarters in each pile using the value of \\( y \\):\n- For the second pile:\n  \\[ y = 6 \\]\n- For the first pile:\n  \\[ x = y - 5 = 6 - 5 = 1 \\]\n- For the third pile:\n  \\[ z = y - 4 = 6 - 4 = 2 \\]\n- For the fourth pile:\n  \\[ w = 3y = 3 \\times 6 = 18 \\]\nNow we can verify the total:\n\\[\nx + y + z + w = 1 + 6 + 2 + 18 = 27\n\\]\nEverything checks out. \nThus, the number of quarters in the fourth pile is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{18}\n\\]",
        "To solve the problem, let's define the number of quarters in each pile using variables.\nLet:\n- \\( x \\) = the number of quarters in the third pile.\n- The second pile has 4 more than the third pile, so the second pile has \\( x + 4 \\).\n- The first pile has 5 fewer than the second pile, thus the first pile has \\( (x + 4) - 5 = x - 1 \\).\n- The fourth pile has three times as many as the second pile, so the fourth pile has \\( 3(x + 4) \\).\nNow we can express the total number of quarters in terms of \\( x \\):\n\\[\n\\text{Total} = (\\text{first pile}) + (\\text{second pile}) + (\\text{third pile}) + (\\text{fourth pile})\n\\]\nThis becomes:\n\\[\n(x - 1) + (x + 4) + x + 3(x + 4) = 27\n\\]\nNow let's simplify the left-hand side:\n\\[\nx - 1 + x + 4 + x + 3(x + 4)\n\\]\nExpanding \\( 3(x + 4) \\):\n\\[\n= x - 1 + x + 4 + x + 3x + 12\n\\]\nCombining like terms:\n\\[\n= 6x + 15 - 1 = 6x + 14\n\\]\nSetting this equal to the total:\n\\[\n6x + 14 = 27\n\\]\nNow, we subtract 14 from both sides:\n\\[\n6x = 27 - 14\n\\]\n\\[\n6x = 13\n\\]\nDividing both sides by 6:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{13}{6}\n\\]\nThis value for \\( x \\) doesn\u2019t make sense in the context of whole quarters, which suggests there may be an inconsistency. Let's reevaluate the setup.\nInstead of using fractions, we'll set up the equation with all piles in whole number terms.
