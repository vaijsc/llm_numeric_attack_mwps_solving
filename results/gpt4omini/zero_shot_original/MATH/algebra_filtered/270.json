        "Let's denote Amy's current age as \\( a \\), Ben's current age as \\( b \\), and Chris's current age as \\( c \\).\nFrom the information given, we can set up the following equations:\n1.

Four years ago, Chris was the same age as Amy is now. This can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   c - 4 = a\n   \\]\n   Therefore, we can express \\( c \\) in terms of \\( a \\):\n   \\[\n   c = a + 4\n   \\]\n3.

This can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   b + 4 = \\frac{3}{5}(a + 4)\n   \\]\nNow, we'll substitute \\( c = a + 4 \\) into the first equation \\( a + b + c = 18 \\):\n\\[\na + b + (a + 4) = 18\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n2a + b + 4 = 18\n\\]\nSubtract 4 from both sides:\n\\[\n2a + b = 14 \\tag{1}\n\\]\nNow, we will substitute \\( b \\) from Equation 1 into the third equation.\nFirst, rearranging Equation 1 gives:\n\\[\nb = 14 - 2a\n\\]\nNow substituting into the equation for Ben's age in four years:\n\\[\n(14 - 2a) + 4 = \\frac{3}{5}(a + 4)\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n18 - 2a = \\frac{3}{5}(a + 4)\n\\]\nMultiplying both sides by 5 to eliminate the fraction:\n\\[\n5(18 - 2a) = 3(a + 4)\n\\]\nThis results in:\n\\[\n90 - 10a = 3a + 12\n\\]\nNext, we combine like terms:\n\\[\n90 - 12 = 3a + 10a\n\\]\n\\[\n78 = 13a\n\\]\nThus,\n\\[\na = \\frac{78}{13} = 6\n\\]\nWe now substitute \\( a = 6 \\) back into our equation for \\( b \\):\n\\[\nb = 14 - 2(6) = 14 - 12 = 2\n\\]\nNow, we calculate \\( c \\) using \\( c = a + 4 \\):\n\\[\nc = 6 + 4 = 10\n\\]\nFinally, let's summarize our findings:\n- \\( a = 6 \\) (Amy's age)\n- \\( b = 2 \\) (Ben's age)\n- \\( c = 10 \\) (Chris's age)\nThus, Chris is currently:\n\\[\n\\boxed{10}\n\\]\nWe'll verify that the conditions are satisfied with these ages:\n1. The average age is \\( \\frac{6 + 2 + 10}{3} = \\frac{18}{3} = 6 \\).\n2. Four years ago, Chris's age was \\( 10 - 4 = 6 \\), which matches Amy\u2019s current age.\n3.
