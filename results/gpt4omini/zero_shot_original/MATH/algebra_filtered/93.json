        "To find the average of the integers \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\), we begin with the information provided about the averages of the pairs of numbers.\n1. **First Average:**\n   We know that the average of \\( a \\) and \\( 2b \\) is 7. We can express this mathematically as:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{a + 2b}{2} = 7\n   \\]\n   Multiplying both sides by 2 gives:\n   \\[\n   a + 2b = 14 \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)}\n   \\]\n2. **Second Average:**\n   We also know that the average of \\( a \\) and \\( 2c \\) is 8. This can be written as:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{a + 2c}{2} = 8\n   \\]\n   Again, multiplying both sides by 2 gives:\n   \\[\n   a + 2c = 16 \\quad \\text{(Equation 2)}\n   \\]\n3. **Setting Up the Equations:**\n   Now we have two equations:\n   \\[\n   a + 2b = 14 \\quad \\text{(1)}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   a + 2c = 16 \\quad \\text{(2)}\n   \\]\n4. **Eliminate \\( a \\):**\n   We can eliminate \\( a \\) by subtracting Equation 1 from Equation 2:\n   \\[\n   (a + 2c) - (a + 2b) = 16 - 14\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this gives:\n   \\[\n   2c - 2b = 2 \\implies 2(c - b) = 2 \\implies c - b = 1\n   \\]\n   Therefore, we can express \\( c \\) in terms of \\( b \\):\n   \\[\n   c = b + 1\n   \\]\n5. **Substituting Back:**\n   We can substitute \\( c = b + 1 \\) back into one of the original equations to find \\( a \\) in terms of \\( b \\).
