        "To solve for the pair \\((a, b)\\) such that the quadratic equation \n\\[\nx^2 + ax + b = 0 \n\\]\nhas roots \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), we can utilize Vieta's formulas. According to Vieta's, for a quadratic equation of the form \n\\[\nx^2 + px + q = 0,\n\\]\nwith roots \\(r_1\\) and \\(r_2\\), the following relationships hold:\n1. The sum of the roots: \\(r_1 + r_2 = -p\\)\n2. The product of the roots: \\(r_1 r_2 = q\\)\nIn this case, we have \\(r_1 = a\\) and \\(r_2 = b\\). Applying Vieta's formulas gives us:\n1. \\(a + b = -a\\)\n2. \\(ab = b\\)\nFrom the first equation, we can rearrange it:\n\\[\na + b = -a \\implies 2a + b = 0 \\implies b = -2a \\tag{1}\n\\]\nFrom the second equation, provided that \\(b \\neq 0\\) (since \\(b\\) is a nonzero real number):\n\\[\nab = b \\implies ab - b = 0 \\implies b(a - 1) = 0 \n\\]\nSince \\(b\\) is nonzero, we must have:\n\\[\na - 1 = 0 \\implies a = 1 \\tag{2}\n\\]\nSubstituting \\(a = 1\\) into equation (1):\n\\[\nb = -2(1) = -2 \n\\]\nThus, we find that:\n\\[\na = 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad b = -2.\n\\]\nFinally, we can present the pair \\((a, b)\\) as:\n\\[\n\\boxed{(1, -2)}.\n\\] \nTo verify, if we substitute \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) back into the original equation:\n1.
