    "solution": "Let $j$ be John's age and $d$ be his dad's age. We are trying to find the value of $d$. We can create a system of two equations to represent the given information. They are\n\n\\begin{align*}\nj &= d - 31 \\\\\nj + d &= 53 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe want to find $d$, so we need to eliminate $j$ from the equations above. Substituting the first equation into the second to eliminate $j$, we have $(d-31)+d=53$, or $d=42$. Thus, John's dad is $\\boxed{42}$ years old.",

        "Let's define John's age as \\( J \\) and his dad's age as \\( D \\).\nFrom the problem, we have two statements:\n1. John is 31 years younger than his dad:\n   \\[\n   J = D - 31\n   \\]\n2. The sum of their ages is 53 years:\n   \\[\n   J + D = 53\n   \\]\nNow we can substitute the first equation into the second equation. This means we can replace \\( J \\) in the second equation:\n\\[\n(D - 31) + D = 53\n\\]\nNow, simplify this equation:\n\\[\nD - 31 + D = 53\n\\]\n\\[\n2D - 31 = 53\n\\]\nNext, add 31 to both sides to isolate the term with \\( D \\):\n\\[\n2D = 53 + 31\n\\]\n\\[\n2D = 84\n\\]\nNow divide both sides by 2 to find \\( D \\):\n\\[\nD = \\frac{84}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nD = 42\n\\]\nNow that we have found \\( D \\), which is John's dad's age, we can also find John's age by substituting back into the first equation:\n\\[\nJ = D - 31\n\\]\n\\[\nJ = 42 - 31\n\\]\n\\[\nJ = 11\n\\]\nThus, John's dad is \\( \\boxed{42} \\) years old.",

        "Let's start by setting up the problem with variables.\nLet \\( J \\) represent John's age and let \\( D \\) represent his dad's age. According to the information given:\n1.

        "Let's define the ages first.\nLet John's dad's age be \\( x \\). According to the problem, John is 31 years younger than his dad. Therefore, we can express John's age as \\( x - 31 \\).\nNow, we know the sum of their ages is 53 years, which can be represented by the equation:\n\\[\nx + (x - 31) = 53\n\\]\nNow, let's simplify the equation:\n1. Combine like terms:\n\\[\n2x - 31 = 53\n\\]\n2. Add 31 to both sides:\n\\[\n2x = 53 + 31\n\\]\n\\[\n2x = 84\n\\]\n3. Divide both sides by 2 to find \\( x \\):\n\\[\nx = \\frac{84}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nx = 42\n\\]\nSo, John's dad is **42 years old**. \nTo double-check, we can also calculate John's age:\n- John's age = \\( 42 - 31 = 11 \\) years old.\n- The sum of their ages = \\( 42 + 11 = 53 \\), which matches the information given.\nThus, John's dad is indeed **42 years old**."
