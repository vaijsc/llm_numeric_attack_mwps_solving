        "To solve the equation \\(\\frac{n+5}{n-3} = 2\\), we can follow these steps:\n1. **Cross-Multiply**: To eliminate the fraction, we multiply both sides of the equation by \\(n - 3\\):\n   \\[\n   n + 5 = 2(n - 3)\n   \\]\n2. **Distribute on the Right Side**: We distribute \\(2\\) on the right side:\n   \\[\n   n + 5 = 2n - 6\n   \\]\n3. **Rearrange the Equation**: We want to isolate \\(n\\). To do this, we will move the \\(n\\) terms to one side and the constant terms to the other side. We can subtract \\(n\\) from both sides:\n   \\[\n   5 = 2n - n - 6\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the right side gives:\n   \\[\n   5 = n - 6\n   \\]\n4. **Solve for \\(n\\)**: Next, we add \\(6\\) to both sides:\n   \\[\n   5 + 6 = n\n   \\]\n   Therefore:\n   \\[\n   n = 11\n   \\]\n5. **Check the Solution**: To ensure our solution is correct, we can substitute \\(n = 11\\) back into the original equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{11 + 5}{11 - 3} = \\frac{16}{8} = 2\n   \\]\n   Since both sides are equal, our solution is verified.\nThus, the value of \\(n\\) is \\(\\boxed{11}\\).",
