    "problem": "If the fourth term of an arithmetic sequence is $200$ and the eighth term is $500$, what is the sixth term?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The sixth term is exactly halfway between the fourth and the eighth in the arithmetic sequence, so it is the average of the two terms. Therefore, the sixth term is $(200 + 500)/2 = \\boxed{350}$.  We also could have found the common difference by noting that there are four steps between the fourth term and the eighth term.  So, if $d$ is the common difference, we have $4d = 500-200 = 300$. Therefore, we find $d=75$.  The sixth term is two steps after the fourth, or $200 + 2d = \\boxed{350}$.",

        "In an arithmetic sequence, each term can be expressed in terms of its first term \\( a \\) and the common difference \\( d \\). The \\( n \\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula:\n\\[\na_n = a + (n - 1)d\n\\]\nWe know the following information:\n1. The fourth term \\( a_4 \\) is 200:\n   \\[\n   a_4 = a + 3d = 200\n   \\]\n2. The eighth term \\( a_8 \\) is 500:\n   \\[\n   a_8 = a + 7d = 500\n   \\]\nNow, we can set up the two equations from the information given:\n1. \\( a + 3d = 200 \\)  (Equation 1)\n2. \\( a + 7d = 500 \\)  (Equation 2)\nNext, we can eliminate \\( a \\) by subtracting Equation 1 from Equation 2:\n\\[\n(a + 7d) - (a + 3d) = 500 - 200\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n4d = 300\n\\]\nNow, solving for \\( d \\):\n\\[\nd = \\frac{300}{4} = 75\n\\]\nWith \\( d \\) determined, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find \\( a \\).
