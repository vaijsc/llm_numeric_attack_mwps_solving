        "We start with the general form of the quadratic equation given by the parabola:\n\\[\ny = ax^2 + bx + c\n\\]\n### Step 1: Using the vertex information\nThe vertex of this parabola, which is at the point \\((p, p)\\), can be calculated using the vertex formula, which states that the x-coordinate of the vertex \\((h)\\) is given by:\n\\[\nh = -\\frac{b}{2a}\n\\]\nSince the x-coordinate of the vertex we have is \\(p\\), we set up the equation:\n\\[\np = -\\frac{b}{2a}\n\\]\nFrom this, we can express \\(b\\) in terms of \\(p\\) and \\(a\\):\n\\[\nb = -2ap\n\\]\n### Step 2: Using the y-intercept information\nNext, we know the y-intercept of the parabola is given by the point \\((0, -p)\\). The y-intercept can be found by evaluating the quadratic equation at \\(x=0\\):\n\\[\ny = c\n\\]\nThus, at \\(x=0\\), we have:\n\\[\nc = -p\n\\]\n### Step 3: Substituting \\(c\\) into the vertex form\nWe substitute \\(c\\) back into our equation of the parabola, we have:\n\\[\ny = ax^2 + bx - p\n\\]\n### Step 4: Finding the y-coordinate of the vertex\nWe know that the y-coordinate of the vertex is also given as \\(p\\). The value of \\(y\\) at the vertex, where \\(x = p\\), is:\n\\[\ny = ap^2 + bp - p\n\\]\nSetting this equal to \\(p\\), we have:\n\\[\nap^2 + bp - p = p\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\nap^2 + bp - 2p = 0\n\\]\n### Step 5: Rearranging the equation\nThe equation can be rearranged as:\n\\[\nap^2 + bp - 2p = 0 \\implies ap^2 + b(p - 2) = 0\n\\]\n### Step 6: Solving for \\(b\\) \nSince \\(p\\) is not equal to \\(0\\) (given \\(p \\neq 0\\)), we can divide both sides of the equation by \\(p\\):\n\\[\nap + b - 2 = 0\n\\]\nThis rearranges to give:\n\\[\nb = 2 - ap\n\\]\n### Step 7: Setting the two expressions for \\(b\\) equal\nWe have two expressions for \\(b\\):\n1. \\(b = -2ap\\)\n2. \\(b = 2 - ap\\)\nSetting these two expressions equal gives us:\n\\[\n-2ap = 2 - ap\n\\]\n### Step 8: Solving for \\(a\\)\nRearranging this equation, we add \\(ap\\) to both sides:\n\\[\n-ap = 2 \\implies a = -\\frac{2}{p}\n\\]\n### Step 9: Substituting \\(a\\) back to find \\(b\\)\nNow we can substitute \\(a\\) back into the expression for \\(b = -2ap\\):\n\\[\nb = -2\\left(-\\frac{2}{p}\\right)p = 4\n\\]\nSo, the value of \\(b\\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{4}\n\\]",
