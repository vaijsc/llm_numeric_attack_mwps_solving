    "solution": "Let $x$ denote the number of hours Sphere has been growing. We can express this problem as an exponential equation, as follows: $$2^{x+6} = 2\\cdot 4^{x+1}.$$Now, since $4 = 2^2$, we have $2\\cdot 4^{x+1} = 2\\cdot (2^2)^{x+1} = 2\\cdot 2^{2x+2} = 2^{2x + 3}$, which means our equation is: $$2^{x + 6} = 2^{2x + 3}.$$Then, we set the exponents equal to each other, and obtain $$x + 6 = 2x + 3.$$Solving for $x$, we get $\\boxed{x = 3}$.",

        "Let's define some variables and outline the growth of both farms over time.\n1. **Rod's Growth:**\n   - Starting population: \\( P_R = 2 \\)\n   - Doubling time: every hour\n   - Therefore, if Rod has been growing for \\( t + 5 \\) hours (since Rod was started 5 hours before Sphere), the population at the time of the check (8 p.m.) can be represented as:\n   \\[\n   P_R = 2 \\times 2^{(t + 5)} = 2^{(t + 6)}\n   \\]\n2. **Sphere's Growth:**\n   - Starting population: \\( P_S = 8 \\)\n   - Quadrupling time: every hour (which is equivalent to \\( 2^{2} \\))\n   - If Sphere has been growing for \\( t \\) hours, its population at 8 p.m. is represented as:\n   \\[\n   P_S = 8 \\times 4^t = 8 \\times (2^2)^t = 8 \\times 2^{2t} = 2^{3} \\times 2^{2t} = 2^{(2t + 3)}\n   \\]\n3. **Setting the Populations Equal:**\n   Now, we set the two populations equal to each other since Jane finds them to be the same at 8 p.m.:\n   \\[\n   2^{(t + 6)} = 2^{(2t + 3)}\n   \\]\n4. **Equal Exponents:**\n   Since the bases are the same, we can equate the exponents:\n   \\[\n   t + 6 = 2t + 3\n   \\]\n5. **Solving for \\( t \\):**\n   To isolate \\( t \\), we can rearrange the equation:\n   \\[\n   6 - 3 = 2t - t\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   3 = t\n   \\]\nThus, Jane started growing Sphere 3 hours ago. Therefore, the time in hours that has passed since she started growing Sphere is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{3}\n\\]",
        "To solve the problem, let's establish the growth of each bacteria farm over time:\n1. **Bacteria farm Rod:**\n   - Starting population: 2 bacteria.\n   - Population doubles every hour.\n   - If Rod is started \\( t \\) hours before 8 p.m., at 8 p.m., its population will be:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Population of Rod at 8 p.m.} = 2 \\times 2^t = 2^{t+1}\n     \\]\n2. **Bacteria farm Sphere:**\n   - Starting population: 8 bacteria.\n   - Population quadruples every hour.\n   - Sphere is started 5 hours after Rod, which means it has been growing for \\( t - 5 \\) hours by the time Jane checks it at 8 p.m. Therefore, its population at 8 p.m. will be:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Population of Sphere at 8 p.m.} = 8 \\times 4^{(t - 5)} = 8 \\times (2^2)^{(t - 5)} = 8 \\times 2^{2(t - 5)} = 8 \\times 2^{2t - 10} = 2^3 \\times 2^{2t - 10} = 2^{2t - 7}\n     \\]\n3. **Finding the time when populations are equal:**\n   At 8 p.m., Jane finds that the populations of both bacteria farms are the same:\n   \\[\n   2^{t + 1} = 2^{2t - 7}\n   \\]\n   Since the bases are the same (both are powers of 2), we can set the exponents equal to each other:\n   \\[\n   t + 1 = 2t - 7\n   \\]\n4. **Solving for \\( t \\):**\n   Rearranging the equation gives:\n   \\[\n   1 + 7 = 2t - t\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   8 = t\n   \\]\n5. **Calculating hours ago Sphere was started:**\n   If \\( t = 8 \\) means Rod was started 8 hours before 8 p.m., then Sphere was started 5 hours after Rod, so:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sphere was started } = 8 - 5 = 3 \\text{ hours ago from 8 p.m.}\n   \\]\nThus, Jane started growing Sphere **3 hours ago**.",
        "To solve this problem, we'll analyze the growth of both bacteria farms step by step.\n1. **Understanding Initial Conditions**:\n   - Bacteria farm Rod starts with 2 bacteria.\n   - Bacteria farm Sphere starts with 8 bacteria.\n   - Rod starts growing 5 hours earlier than Sphere.\n2. **Growth Rates**:\n   - The population of Rod doubles every hour.\n   - The population of Sphere quadruples every hour.\n3. **Denoting Time**:\n   - Let \\( t \\) represent the number of hours that have passed since Jane started growing Sphere.\n   - This means that Rod has been growing for \\( t + 5 \\) hours (since it started 5 hours earlier).\n4. **Expressing Populations as Functions of Time**:\n   - The population of Rod after \\( t + 5 \\) hours:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Population of Rod} = 2 \\times 2^{t + 5} = 2^{t + 6}\n     \\]\n   - The population of Sphere after \\( t \\) hours:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Population of Sphere} = 8 \\times 4^t = 8 \\times (2^2)^t = 8 \\times 2^{2t} = 8 \\times 2^t \\times 2^t = 2^{3 + 2t}\n     \\]\n5. **Setting Populations Equal**:\n   Since they have the same population at 8 p.m., we can set their populations equal:\n   \\[\n   2^{t + 6} = 2^{3 + 2t}\n   \\]\n6. **Equalizing the Exponents**:\n   Because the bases are the same (both are base 2), we can set the exponents equal:\n   \\[\n   t + 6 = 3 + 2t\n   \\]\n7. **Solving for \\( t \\)**:\n   Rearranging the equation:\n   \\[\n   6 - 3 = 2t - t \\implies 3 = t\n   \\]\n8. **Conclusion**:\n   Therefore, Jane started growing Sphere **3 hours ago**.\nThus, the answer is **3 hours ago**.",
        "To determine how many hours ago Jane started growing Sphere, we need to set up the problem step by step based on the information provided. \n1. **Establish the time differences**:\n   - Jane started growing Rod 5 hours before she started growing Sphere.\n   - If she checks the farms at 8 p.m., let's define the starting time:\n     - Let \\( t \\) be the number of hours since Jane started growing Sphere.\n     - Therefore, Rod has been growing for \\( t + 5 \\) hours.\n2. **Population growth formulas**:\n   - The population of Rod (starting from 2 bacteria and doubling every hour) can be expressed as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Population of Rod} = 2 \\times 2^{(t + 5)} = 2^{t + 6}\n     \\]\n   - The population of Sphere (starting from 8 bacteria and quadrupling every hour) can be expressed as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Population of Sphere} = 8 \\times 4^{t} = 8 \\times (2^2)^{t} = 8 \\times 2^{2t} = 2^3 \\times 2^{2t} = 2^{2t + 3}\n     \\]\n3. **Set the populations equal**:\n   - At 8 p.m., the populations of Rod and Sphere are equal:\n     \\[\n     2^{t + 6} = 2^{2t + 3}\n     \\]\n4. **Equate the exponents**:\n   - Since the bases are the same, we can set the exponents equal to each other:\n     \\[\n     t + 6 = 2t + 3\n     \\]\n5. **Solve for \\( t \\)**:\n   - Rearranging the equation gives:\n     \\[\n     t + 6 - 3 = 2t\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     3 = 2t - t\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     t = 3\n     \\]\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Therefore, Jane started growing Sphere 3 hours ago.\nSo, to answer the question, Jane started growing Sphere **3 hours ago**.",
        "To solve the problem, we need to set up the equations based on the growth rates of the bacteria farms, and the time difference in starting them.\n1. **Bacteria Growth Rates**:\n   - Rod's population doubles every hour: \n     \\[\n     P_{\\text{Rod}} = 2 \\cdot 2^h\n     \\]\n     where \\( h \\) is the number of hours Rod has been growing.\n   \n   - Sphere's population quadruples every hour:\n     \\[\n     P_{\\text{Sphere}} = 8 \\cdot 4^t\n     \\]\n     where \\( t \\) is the number of hours Sphere has been growing.\n2. **Time Difference**:\n   - Jane starts growing Rod 5 hours before she starts growing Sphere. \n   - If Sphere has been growing for \\( t \\) hours, then Rod has been growing for \\( t + 5 \\) hours.\n3. **Equality of Populations**:\n   - At 8 p.m., the populations of both farms are equal:\n     \\[\n     P_{\\text{Rod}} = P_{\\text{Sphere}}\n     \\]\n   - Substituting the expressions for the two populations:\n     \\[\n     2 \\cdot 2^{t+5} = 8 \\cdot 4^t\n     \\]\n4. **Simplifying the Equation**:\n   - Note that \\( 4^t = (2^2)^t = 2^{2t} \\), so we can rewrite the right side:\n     \\[\n     8 \\cdot 4^t = 8 \\cdot 2^{2t} = 8 = 2^3 \\cdot 2^{2t} = 2^{3 + 2t}\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the equation becomes:\n     \\[\n     2 \\cdot 2^{t+5} = 2^{3 + 2t}\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying the left side:\n     \\[\n     2^{1 + t + 5} = 2^{t + 6}\n     \\]\n   - So we have:\n     \\[\n     2^{t + 6} = 2^{3 + 2t}\n     \\]\n5. **Setting the Exponents Equal**:\n   - Since the bases are the same, we can set the exponents equal:\n     \\[\n     t + 6 = 3 + 2t\n     \\]\n   - Rearranging gives:\n     \\[\n     6 - 3 = 2t - t \\implies 3 = t\n     \\]\n6. **Finding the Time for Sphere**:\n   - Since \\( t = 3 \\), Sphere has been growing for 3 hours.\n   - Therefore, since Jane started growing Sphere 3 hours ago, we can find how long ago she started growing Sphere in relation to when she checked:\n   \n   - **Final Answer**: Jane started growing Sphere **3 hours ago**. \nThus, at 5 p.m., Jane started growing Sphere."
