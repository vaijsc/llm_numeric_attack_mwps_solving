    "solution": "Suppose we played $x$ games.  Since we won $2/9$ of the games we played, we won $(2/9)x = 2x/9$ games. Therefore, we lost $x - 2x/9 = 7x/9$ games.  Since we lost 15 more games than we won, we have \\[\\frac{7x}{9} - \\frac{2x}{9} = 15.\\]Simplifying the left side gives $5x/9 = 15$, and solving this equation gives $x = \\boxed{27}$ games played.",

        "Let's denote the total number of games played by the team as \\( x \\).\nSince the team won \\( \\frac{2}{9} \\) of its games, the number of games won can be expressed as:\n\\[\n\\text{Games won} = \\frac{2}{9} x\n\\]\nThe team lost 15 more games than it won. Therefore, the number of games lost is:\n\\[\n\\text{Games lost} = \\text{Games won} + 15 = \\frac{2}{9} x + 15\n\\]\nSince the total number of games played is equal to the sum of games won and games lost, we can set up the equation:\n\\[\nx = \\text{Games won} + \\text{Games lost}\n\\]\nSubstituting the expressions for games won and lost into the equation gives us:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{2}{9} x + \\left( \\frac{2}{9} x + 15 \\right)\n\\]\nNow, simplify the right side of the equation:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{2}{9} x + \\frac{2}{9} x + 15\n\\]\n\\[\nx = \\frac{4}{9} x + 15\n\\]\nTo isolate \\( x \\), we first subtract \\( \\frac{4}{9} x \\) from both sides:\n\\[\nx - \\frac{4}{9} x = 15\n\\]\nCalculating the left side:\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{9} x = 15\n\\]\nNext, to solve for \\( x \\), multiply both sides by \\( \\frac{9}{5} \\):\n\\[\nx = 15 \\cdot \\frac{9}{5}\n\\]\n\\[\nx = \\frac{135}{5}\n\\]\n\\[\nx = 27\n\\]\nThus, the total number of games played this year is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{27}\n\\]\n### Verification:\nLet's verify our solution:\n1. **Games won**: \n   \\[\n   \\frac{2}{9} \\times 27 = 6\n   \\]\n2. **Games lost**: \n   \\[\n   6 + 15 = 21\n   \\]\n3. **Total games**: \n   \\[\n   6 + 21 = 27\n   \\]\nEverything checks out, confirming that the team played \\( \\boxed{27} \\) games this season.",
