        "To solve the inequality \\( |x - 2| \\leq 5.6 \\), we start by interpreting the absolute value inequality. The expression \\( |x - 2| \\leq 5.6 \\) states that the distance between \\( x \\) and \\( 2 \\) is at most \\( 5.6 \\).\nThis leads us to the equivalent double inequality:\n\\[\n-5.6 \\leq x - 2 \\leq 5.6\n\\]\nNext, we can solve this double inequality for \\( x \\). We will break it down into two parts:\n1. **From the left side:** \n   \\[\n   -5.6 \\leq x - 2\n   \\]\n   Adding \\( 2 \\) to both sides gives:\n   \\[\n   -5.6 + 2 \\leq x\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this, we have:\n   \\[\n   -3.6 \\leq x\n   \\]\n2. **From the right side:**\n   \\[\n   x - 2 \\leq 5.6\n   \\]\n   Again, we add \\( 2 \\) to both sides:\n   \\[\n   x \\leq 5.6 + 2\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   x \\leq 7.6\n   \\]\nCombining both parts, we have the final compound inequality:\n\\[\n-3.6 \\leq x \\leq 7.6\n\\]\nNext, we need to determine the integers within this range. The smallest integer greater than or equal to \\(-3.6\\) is \\(-3\\) and the largest integer less than or equal to \\(7.6\\) is \\(7\\).\nNow let's enumerate the integers from \\(-3\\) to \\(7\\):\n- \\(-3\\)\n- \\(-2\\)\n- \\(-1\\)\n- \\(0\\)\n- \\(1\\)\n- \\(2\\)\n- \\(3\\)\n- \\(4\\)\n- \\(5\\)\n- \\(6\\)\n- \\(7\\)\nCounting these integers:\n1. \\(-3\\)\n2. \\(-2\\)\n3. \\(-1\\)\n4. \\(0\\)\n5. \\(1\\)\n6. \\(2\\)\n7. \\(3\\)\n8. \\(4\\)\n9. \\(5\\)\n10. \\(6\\)\n11. \\(7\\)\nThere are \\(11\\) integers in total.\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{11}\n\\]",
