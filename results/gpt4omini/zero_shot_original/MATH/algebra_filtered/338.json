    "solution": "Because $\\text{(rate)(time)} = \\text{(distance)}$, the distance Josh rode was $(4/5)(2) = 8/5$ of the distance that Mike rode.  Let $m$ be the number of miles that Mike had ridden when they met. Then the number of miles between their houses is \\[\n13 = m + \\frac{8}{5}m = \\frac{13}{5}m.\n\\]Thus $m = \\boxed{5}$.",

        "Let's define some variables to help solve the problem:\n- Let \\( t \\) be the time (in hours) that Mike rides until they meet.\n- Therefore, Josh rides for \\( 2t \\) hours, since he rode for twice the length of time as Mike.\nNext, let\u2019s define their rates of speed:\n- Let \\( r \\) be the rate (in miles per hour) at which Mike rides.\n- Since Josh rides at four-fifths of Mike's rate, Josh\u2019s rate would be \\( \\frac{4}{5}r \\).\nNow we can express the distance each person rides in terms of \\( r \\) and \\( t \\):\n- The distance Mike rides is given by his speed multiplied by time: \n  \\[\n  \\text{Distance}_{Mike} = r \\cdot t\n  \\]\n  \n- The distance Josh rides is given by his speed multiplied by time: \n  \\[\n  \\text{Distance}_{Josh} = \\left(\\frac{4}{5}r\\right) \\cdot (2t) = \\frac{8}{5}rt\n  \\]\nSince they start 13 miles apart, the total distance they cover when they meet is equal to 13 miles:\n\\[\n\\text{Distance}_{Mike} + \\text{Distance}_{Josh} = 13\n\\]\nSubstituting the expressions for distances:\n\\[\nrt + \\frac{8}{5}rt = 13\n\\]\nCombine the terms on the left side:\n\\[\n\\left(1 + \\frac{8}{5}\\right)rt = 13\n\\]\nConvert \\(1\\) into a fraction with a common denominator:\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{5} + \\frac{8}{5} = \\frac{13}{5}\n\\]\nTherefore, we have:\n\\[\n\\frac{13}{5}rt = 13\n\\]\nTo solve for \\( rt \\), multiply both sides by \\( \\frac{5}{13} \\):\n\\[\nrt = 13 \\cdot \\frac{5}{13} = 5\n\\]\nNow, we need to find how far Mike rode.
