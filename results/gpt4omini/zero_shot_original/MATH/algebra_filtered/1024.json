        "To calculate the amount of interest earned in two years on a deposit of $10,000 invested at an interest rate of 4.5% compounded annually, we can use the compound interest formula:\n\\[\nA = P(1 + r)^t\n\\]\nWhere:\n- \\( A \\) is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n- \\( P \\) is the principal amount (the initial deposit).\n- \\( r \\) is the annual interest rate (decimal).\n- \\( t \\) is the number of years the money is invested or borrowed for.\nGiven the values:\n- \\( P = 10,000 \\)\n- \\( r = 4.5\\% = 0.045 \\) (as a decimal)\n- \\( t = 2 \\)\nNow, substitute these values into the formula:\n\\[\nA = 10,000(1 + 0.045)^2\n\\]\nCalculating \\( (1 + 0.045) \\):\n\\[\n1 + 0.045 = 1.045\n\\]\nNow raise it to the power of 2:\n\\[\n(1.045)^2 = 1.045 \\times 1.045 = 1.092025\n\\]\nNow, substitute this back into the equation for \\( A \\):\n\\[\nA = 10,000 \\times 1.092025 = 10,920.25\n\\]\nThe total amount after 2 years is $10,920.25.\nNext, to find the interest earned, we subtract the principal from the total amount:\n\\[\n\\text{Interest} = A - P = 10,920.25 - 10,000 = 920.25\n\\]\nThus, the amount of interest earned in two years is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{920.25}\n\\]",
