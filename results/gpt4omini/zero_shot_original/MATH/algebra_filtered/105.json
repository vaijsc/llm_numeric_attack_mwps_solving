    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Call the amount of apples Amy has $a$ and the amount of apples Betty has $b$. We can use the following system of equations to represent the given information: \\begin{align*}\na + b &= 20 \\\\\na &= 3b \\\\\n\\end{align*}Substituting for $a$ into the first equation gives $3b + b = 20$. Solving for $b$ gives $b = 5$. Thus $a = 15$. So Amy has $15 - 5 = \\boxed{10}$ more apples than Betty.",

        "Let's denote the number of apples that Betty has as \\( x \\). Then, according to the problem, Amy has three times the number of apples that Betty has, which can be expressed as \\( 3x \\).\nTogether, they have a total of 20 apples. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\\[\nx + 3x = 20\n\\]\nCombining like terms gives:\n\\[\n4x = 20\n\\]\nNow, we can solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 4:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n\\]\nSo, Betty has 5 apples. To find the number of apples that Amy has, we substitute \\( x \\) back into the expression for Amy's apples:\n\\[\n3x = 3 \\times 5 = 15\n\\]\nNow we can see that Amy has 15 apples. \nTo find out how many more apples Amy has than Betty, we subtract the number of apples Betty has from the number of apples Amy has:\n\\[\n15 - 5 = 10\n\\]\nThus, Amy has **10** more apples than Betty.",
        "Let's denote the number of apples Betty has as \\( B \\). According to the problem, Amy has three times the number of apples that Betty has, so we can express the number of apples Amy has as \\( 3B \\).\nTogether, Amy and Betty have a total of 20 apples, which gives us the equation:\n\\[\nB + 3B = 20\n\\]\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\\[\n4B = 20\n\\]\nNow, we can solve for \\( B \\) by dividing both sides by 4:\n\\[\nB = \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n\\]\nSince we have found that Betty has 5 apples, we can now determine how many apples Amy has:\n\\[\nA = 3B = 3 \\times 5 = 15\n\\]\nNow, we can find out how many more apples Amy has than Betty:\n\\[\nA - B = 15 - 5 = 10\n\\]\nThus, Amy has 10 more apples than Betty.",

According to the problem, Amy has three times the number of apples that Betty has, so we can express the number of apples that Amy has as \\( 3b \\).\nTogether, Amy and Betty have a total of 20 apples.
