        "To determine how many bacteria will be present at midnight, we need to follow these steps:\n1. **Identify the initial population and the doubling time**:\n   - At noon, the population of bacteria is \\(600\\).\n   - The bacteria double every \\(4\\) hours.\n2. **Calculate the number of \\(4\\)-hour intervals from noon to midnight**:\n   - The time from noon to midnight is \\(12\\) hours.\n   - We need to find how many \\(4\\)-hour intervals fit into \\(12\\) hours:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Number of intervals} = \\frac{12 \\text{ hours}}{4 \\text{ hours per interval}} = 3 \\text{ intervals}\n     \\]\n3. **Calculate the population after each interval**:\n   - At the end of each \\(4\\)-hour interval, the bacteria double:\n     - After the first \\(4\\) hours (at \\(4\\) PM):\n       \\[\n       600 \\times 2 = 1200 \\text{ bacteria}\n       \\]\n     - After the second \\(4\\) hours (at \\(8\\) PM):\n       \\[\n       1200 \\times 2 = 2400 \\text{ bacteria}\n       \\]\n     - After the third \\(4\\) hours (at midnight):\n       \\[\n       2400 \\times 2 = 4800 \\text{ bacteria}\n       \\]\n4. **Final population at midnight**:\n   - Therefore, at midnight, the total number of bacteria will be \\(4800\\).\nThus, the number of bacteria present at midnight is \\( \\boxed{4800} \\).",
        "To determine how many bacteria will be present at midnight, we will first calculate how many doubling periods occur from noon to midnight.\n1. **Identify the time interval:**\n   - From noon to midnight is a total of 12 hours.\n2. **Determine the number of doubling periods:**\n   - Since the bacteria double every 4 hours, we can find the number of 4-hour periods in 12 hours by dividing 12 by 4:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of doubling periods} = \\frac{12 \\text{ hours}}{4 \\text{ hours/doubling}} = 3 \\text{ doubling periods}\n   \\]\n3. **Calculate the bacteria count after each doubling period:**\n   - We start with 600 bacteria at noon.
