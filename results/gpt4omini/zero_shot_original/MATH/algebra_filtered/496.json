        "To determine the smallest integer value of \\( x \\) for which \\( f(x) = \\frac{\\sqrt{x-1}}{x-2} \\) has a real number value, we need to ensure that both the numerator and the denominator are valid.\n1. **Consider the numerator \\( \\sqrt{x-1} \\)**:\n   - The expression under the square root must be non-negative, so we set up the inequality:\n     \\[\n     x - 1 \\geq 0\n     \\]\n     This simplifies to:\n     \\[\n     x \\geq 1\n     \\]\n   - Thus, \\( x \\) must be at least 1.\n2. **Consider the denominator \\( x - 2 \\)**:\n   - The denominator cannot be zero, so we set up the inequality:\n     \\[\n     x - 2 \\neq 0\n     \\]\n     This simplifies to:\n     \\[\n     x \\neq 2\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, while \\( x \\) should be at least 1, it cannot be equal to 2.\n3. **Combine the conditions**:\n   - From the numerator, we have \\( x \\geq 1 \\).\n   - From the denominator, we have \\( x \\neq 2 \\).\n4. **Determine the smallest integer satisfying these conditions**:\n   - The smallest integer \\( x \\geq 1 \\) is 1.\n   - However, since \\( x = 2 \\) is not allowed, we check the next integers.
