        "To find the sum of all of the terms of the sequence \\( B \\), we first need to consider the defining characteristics of sequence \\( A \\).\nThe sequence \\( A \\) is formed by:\n- First term: \\( A_1 = 5 \\)\n- Common difference: \\( d = -2 \\)\nThus, the \\( k^{th} \\) term of \\( A \\) can be expressed as:\n\\[\nA_k = A_1 + (k-1)d = 5 + (k-1)(-2) = 5 - 2(k-1)\n\\]\nSimplifying this expression gives:\n\\[\nA_k = 5 - 2k + 2 = 7 - 2k\n\\]\nSo the terms of sequence \\( A \\) are:\n\\[\nA_1 = 5, \\quad A_2 = 3, \\quad A_3 = 1, \\quad A_4 = -1, \\quad A_5 = -3, \\quad A_6 = -5, \\ldots\n\\]\nWe observe that the terms continue decreasing indefinitely since the common difference is negative. \nNext, we define sequence \\( B \\) such that the \\( k^{th} \\) term of \\( B \\) is:\n\\[\nB_k = 2^{A_k}\n\\]\nSubstituting our expression for \\( A_k \\):\n\\[\nB_k = 2^{7 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe can simplify \\( B_k \\) further:\n\\[\nB_k = 2^7 \\cdot 2^{-2k} = 128 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^k\n\\]\nThis shows that \\( B \\) is a geometric sequence with:\n- First term: \\( B_1 = 128 \\)\n- Common ratio: \\( r = \\frac{1}{4} \\)\nTo find the sum of the infinite geometric series, we use the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series:\n\\[\nS = \\frac{a}{1 - r}\n\\]\nwhere \\( a \\) is the first term and \\( r \\) is the common ratio.
