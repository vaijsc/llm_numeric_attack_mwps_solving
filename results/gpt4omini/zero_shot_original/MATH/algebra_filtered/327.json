        "To determine the degree of the product of two polynomials, we can use the property that the degree of the product of two polynomials is equal to the sum of their degrees.\nLet\u2019s denote the degrees of the polynomials \\( p(t) \\) and \\( q(t) \\):\n- The degree of \\( p(t) \\) is \\( 7 \\) (since it is a seventh-degree polynomial).\n- The degree of \\( q(t) \\) is also \\( 7 \\) (as it is also a seventh-degree polynomial).\nWhen we multiply these two polynomials, the degree of the resulting polynomial \\( p(t) \\cdot q(t) \\) can be calculated as:\n\\[\n\\text{degree}(p(t) \\cdot q(t)) = \\text{degree}(p(t)) + \\text{degree}(q(t))\n\\]\nSubstituting the degrees of \\( p(t) \\) and \\( q(t) \\):\n\\[\n\\text{degree}(p(t) \\cdot q(t)) = 7 + 7 = 14\n\\]\nThus, the degree of the product \\( p(t) \\cdot q(t) \\) is \n\\[\n\\boxed{14}\n\\]",
        "To determine the degree of the product of two polynomials, we need to consider the degrees of the individual polynomials. \nLet \\( p(t) \\) and \\( q(t) \\) be two polynomials.
