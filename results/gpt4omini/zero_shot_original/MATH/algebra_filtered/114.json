        "To evaluate \\(\\lfloor6.7\\rfloor+\\lfloor-6.7\\rfloor\\), we first need to calculate the individual floor values of \\(6.7\\) and \\(-6.7\\).\n1. **Calculate \\(\\lfloor 6.7 \\rfloor\\)**:\n   The floor function \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor\\) gives us the greatest integer less than or equal to \\(x\\). For \\(6.7\\),\n   \\[\n   \\lfloor 6.7 \\rfloor = 6\n   \\]\n   because \\(6\\) is the largest integer that is less than or equal to \\(6.7\\).\n2. **Calculate \\(\\lfloor -6.7 \\rfloor\\)**:\n   Now, we find \\(\\lfloor -6.7 \\rfloor\\). Again using the definition of the floor function, we look for the greatest integer that is less than or equal to \\(-6.7\\). The integers less than \\(-6.7\\) are \\(-7, -8, -9,\\ldots\\), and clearly,\n   \\[\n   \\lfloor -6.7 \\rfloor = -7\n   \\]\n   because \\(-7\\) is the largest integer less than \\(-6.7\\).\n3. **Adding the two floor values**:\n   Now that we have both values, we add them together:\n   \\[\n   \\lfloor 6.7 \\rfloor + \\lfloor -6.7 \\rfloor = 6 + (-7) = 6 - 7 = -1\n   \\]\nThus, the final result is\n\\[\n\\boxed{-1}\n\\]",
