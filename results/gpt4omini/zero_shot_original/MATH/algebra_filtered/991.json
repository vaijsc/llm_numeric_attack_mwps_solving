        "To find the median of 27 consecutive positive integers whose sum is \\(3^7\\), we begin by determining some properties of the sum of consecutive integers.\nLet the 27 consecutive positive integers be represented as:\n\\[\nn, n + 1, n + 2, \\ldots, n + 26\n\\]\nwhere \\(n\\) is the first integer. The sum \\(S\\) of these integers can be calculated as follows:\n\\[\nS = n + (n + 1) + (n + 2) + \\ldots + (n + 26)\n\\]\nThis can be simplified to:\n\\[\nS = 27n + (0 + 1 + 2 + \\ldots + 26)\n\\]\nThe sum of the integers from 0 to 26 can be computed using the formula for the sum of the first \\(m\\) integers, which is \\(\\frac{m(m + 1)}{2}\\). In this case, \\(m = 26\\):\n\\[\n0 + 1 + 2 + \\ldots + 26 = \\frac{26 \\cdot 27}{2} = 351\n\\]\nThus, the sum \\(S\\) becomes:\n\\[\nS = 27n + 351\n\\]\nWe know from the problem statement that this sum equals \\(3^7\\):\n\\[\n27n + 351 = 3^7\n\\]\nCalculating \\(3^7\\):\n\\[\n3^7 = 2187\n\\]\nNow, substituting this into the equation, we have:\n\\[\n27n + 351 = 2187\n\\]\nNext, we solve for \\(n\\):\n\\[\n27n = 2187 - 351\n\\]\nCalculating \\(2187 - 351\\):\n\\[\n2187 - 351 = 1836\n\\]\nNow, we divide by 27 to find \\(n\\):\n\\[\nn = \\frac{1836}{27}\n\\]\nCalculating this division:\n\\[\nn = 68\n\\]\nNow, we can find the set of integers:\n\\[\n68, 69, 70, \\ldots, 94\n\\]\nSince we are looking for the median of these 27 integers, we note that the median in an odd-length list is the middle number. For 27 integers, the median is the 14th integer (as there are 13 on either side):\n\\[\n\\text{Median} = n + 13 = 68 + 13 = 81\n\\]\nThus, the median of the 27 consecutive positive integers is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{81}\n\\]",
