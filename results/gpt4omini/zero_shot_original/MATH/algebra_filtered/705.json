    "problem": "When a car's brakes are applied, it travels 5 feet less in each  second than the previous second until it comes to a complete stop.  A car goes 45 feet in the first second after the brakes are applied.  How many feet does the car travel from the time the  brakes are applied to the time the car stops?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The number of feet the car travels in each second is an arithmetic sequence with first term 45 and common difference $-5$.  We are summing all the positive terms in this sequence (these terms represent the number of feet the car travels in each second). Thus, we want to find the sum $45+40+\\dots+5$.\n\nThe sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms.  The number of terms is $45/5 = 9$, so the sum is $(45 + 5)/2 \\cdot 9 = \\boxed{225}$.",

        "Let's break down the problem step by step.\n1. **Initial Distance**: When the brakes are applied, the car travels 45 feet in the first second.\n2. **Subsequent Distances**: After the first second, the car travels 5 feet less each second. We can calculate the distance traveled for each subsequent second until the car comes to a complete stop.\n   - **1st second**: 45 feet\n   - **2nd second**: \\( 45 - 5 = 40 \\) feet\n   - **3rd second**: \\( 40 - 5 = 35 \\) feet\n   - **4th second**: \\( 35 - 5 = 30 \\) feet\n   - **5th second**: \\( 30 - 5 = 25 \\) feet\n   - **6th second**: \\( 25 - 5 = 20 \\) feet\n   - **7th second**: \\( 20 - 5 = 15 \\) feet\n   - **8th second**: \\( 15 - 5 = 10 \\) feet\n   - **9th second**: \\( 10 - 5 = 5 \\) feet\n   - **10th second**: \\( 5 - 5 = 0 \\) feet (the car comes to a complete stop)\n3. **Summing Distances**: Now, we sum the distances traveled in each second until the car stops:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Distance} = 45 + 40 + 35 + 30 + 25 + 20 + 15 + 10 + 5 + 0\n   \\]\n4. **Calculating the Total**: \n   Let's add these values:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   45 + 40 & = 85 \\\\\n   85 + 35 & = 120 \\\\\n   120 + 30 & = 150 \\\\\n   150 + 25 & = 175 \\\\\n   175 + 20 & = 195 \\\\\n   195 + 15 & = 210 \\\\\n   210 + 10 & = 220 \\\\\n   220 + 5 & = 225 \\\\\n   225 + 0 & = 225\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n5. **Final Result**: Therefore, the total distance the car travels from the time the brakes are applied until it comes to a stop is \n   \\[\n   \\boxed{225} \\text{ feet.}\n   \\]",
