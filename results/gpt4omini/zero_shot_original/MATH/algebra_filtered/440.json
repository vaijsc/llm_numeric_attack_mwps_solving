    "problem": "For a certain species of ocean fish, 8 fish can exist per cubic meter of water without the symptoms of overcrowding. If doctors want to study 600 fish, what is the minimum number of cubic meters of water necessary to maintain a healthy study environment?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We need 8 fish per cubic meter.  We have 600 fish, so we have $600/8 = 75$ groups of 8 fish, which means we need $\\boxed{75}$ cubic meters of water.",

        "To determine the minimum number of cubic meters of water necessary to maintain a healthy environment for 600 fish, we need to follow these steps:\n1. **Identify the maximum capacity per cubic meter**: We know that 8 fish can live per cubic meter without symptoms of overcrowding.\n2. **Calculate the number of cubic meters needed for 600 fish**: We can use the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cubic meters required} = \\frac{\\text{Total number of fish}}{\\text{Fish per cubic meter}}\n   \\]\n   Plugging in our values:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cubic meters required} = \\frac{600 \\text{ fish}}{8 \\text{ fish/cubic meter}} = 75 \\text{ cubic meters}\n   \\]\n3. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the minimum number of cubic meters of water necessary to maintain a healthy study environment for 600 fish is **75 cubic meters**.",

        "To determine the minimum number of cubic meters of water needed to maintain 600 fish without overcrowding, we start with the information that 8 fish can exist per cubic meter of water.\nHere's a step-by-step approach:\n1. **Identify the fish per cubic meter**: We know that 8 fish can live comfortably in 1 cubic meter of water.\n2. **Calculate the total number of cubic meters needed**: To find out how many cubic meters are required for 600 fish, we divide the total number of fish by the number of fish that can live in one cubic meter.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cubic meters needed} = \\frac{\\text{Total number of fish}}{\\text{Fish per cubic meter}} = \\frac{600 \\text{ fish}}{8 \\text{ fish/cubic meter}}\n   \\]\n3. **Perform the division**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cubic meters needed} = \\frac{600}{8} = 75\n   \\]\n4. **Conclusion**: Therefore, a minimum of 75 cubic meters of water is necessary to maintain a healthy environment for 600 fish.\nThus, the minimum number of cubic meters of water required is **75 cubic meters**.",
