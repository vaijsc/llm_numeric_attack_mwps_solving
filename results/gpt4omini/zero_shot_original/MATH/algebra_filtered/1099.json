        "To solve the equation \n\\[\nx = \\frac{1}{2 + \\frac{1}{x - 2}},\n\\]\nlet's first simplify the right-hand side. We start by isolating the expression involving \\(x\\):\n1. Rewrite the equation:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{1}{2 + \\frac{1}{x - 2}}.\n   \\]\n2. Let's set \\(y = x - 2\\), hence, \\(x = y + 2\\). Substitute this in:\n   \\[\n   y + 2 = \\frac{1}{2 + \\frac{1}{y}}.\n   \\]\n3. Simplify the right-hand side:\n   Calculate \\(2 + \\frac{1}{y}\\):\n   \\[\n   2 + \\frac{1}{y} = \\frac{2y + 1}{y}.\n   \\]\n   Therefore, \n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{2 + \\frac{1}{y}} = \\frac{y}{2y + 1}.\n   \\]\n4. Substitute back in:\n   \\[\n   y + 2 = \\frac{y}{2y + 1}.\n   \\]\n5. Multiply both sides by \\(2y + 1\\) to eliminate the fraction:\n   \\[\n   (y + 2)(2y + 1) = y.\n   \\]\n   Expanding the left side:\n   \\[\n   2y^2 + y + 4y + 2 = y,\n   \\]\n   simplifies to \n   \\[\n   2y^2 + 5y + 2 = y.\n   \\]\n6. Rearranging gives:\n   \\[\n   2y^2 + 4y + 2 = 0,\n   \\]\n   or\n   \\[\n   y^2 + 2y + 1 = 0.\n   \\]\n7. Factoring the quadratic:\n   \\[\n   (y + 1)^2 = 0.\n   \\]\n   So, we get:\n   \\[\n   y + 1 = 0 \\implies y = -1.\n   \\]\n8. Recall that \\(y = x - 2\\):\n   \\[\n   x - 2 = -1 \\implies x = 1.\n   \\]\nNow, the positive solution to the original equation must be checked. Notice that \\(x = 1\\) does not satisfy the condition that \\(x > 2\\). \nLet\u2019s check for possible errors. Instead of the substitution, let's follow the initial equation's direct manipulations.\nReturning to \n\\[\nx = \\frac{1}{2 + \\frac{1}{x - 2}},\n\\]\n6.
