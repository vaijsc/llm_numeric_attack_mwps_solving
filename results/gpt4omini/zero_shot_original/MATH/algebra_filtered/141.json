        "To determine for how many positive integers \\( n \\) the expression \\( n^2 - 3n + 2 \\) is a prime number, we start by simplifying the expression.\nWe can factor \\( n^2 - 3n + 2 \\):\n\\[\nn^2 - 3n + 2 = (n-1)(n-2).\n\\]\nThis shows that \\( n^2 - 3n + 2 \\) is the product of two factors: \\( n-1 \\) and \\( n-2 \\).\nNext, we analyze under what conditions the product \\( (n-1)(n-2) \\) results in a prime number. A prime number is defined as a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\nSince \\( (n-1)(n-2) \\) consists of two factors, it can typically yield a prime number only under specific conditions, since the product of two integers greater than 1 cannot be prime.\nWe consider the cases based on \\( n \\):\n1. **Case when \\( n = 1 \\):**\n   \\[\n   n^2 - 3n + 2 = 1^2 - 3(1) + 2 = 1 - 3 + 2 = 0,\n   \\]\n   which is not prime.\n   \n2. **Case when \\( n = 2 \\):**\n   \\[\n   n^2 - 3n + 2 = 2^2 - 3(2) + 2 = 4 - 6 + 2 = 0,\n   \\]\n   which is also not prime.\n3. **Case when \\( n = 3 \\):**\n   \\[\n   n^2 - 3n + 2 = 3^2 - 3(3) + 2 = 9 - 9 + 2 = 2,\n   \\]\n   which is prime.\n4. **Case when \\( n = 4 \\):**\n   \\[\n   n^2 - 3n + 2 = 4^2 - 3(4) + 2 = 16 - 12 + 2 = 6,\n   \\]\n   which is not prime.\n5. **Case when \\( n = 5 \\):**\n   \\[\n   n^2 - 3n + 2 = 5^2 - 3(5) + 2 = 25 - 15 + 2 = 12,\n   \\]\n   which is not prime.\n6. **Case when \\( n = 6 \\):**\n   \\[\n   n^2 - 3n + 2 = 6^2 - 3(6) + 2 = 36 - 18 + 2 = 20,\n   \\]\n   which is not prime.\n7. **Case when \\( n \\geq 7 \\):**\n   For \\( n \\geq 7 \\), both factors \\( n-1 \\) and \\( n-2 \\) are greater than 1. Therefore, their product \\( (n-1)(n-2) \\) will also be greater than 1 and cannot be prime because it will have multiple divisors.\nAfter checking these cases, we find that the only positive integer \\( n \\) for which \\( n^2 - 3n + 2 \\) is prime is \\( n = 3 \\).\nThus, the total number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that \\( n^2 - 3n + 2 \\) is prime is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}.\n\\]",
        "To determine how many positive integers \\( n \\) make \\( n^2 - 3n + 2 \\) a prime number, we start by factoring the quadratic expression:\n\\[\nn^2 - 3n + 2 = (n-1)(n-2)\n\\]\nNext, we note that \\( (n-1)(n-2) \\) is the product of two consecutive integers. The key observation here is that if the product \\( (n-1)(n-2) \\) is to be a prime number, one of these factors must be equal to 1 because a prime number has exactly two positive divisors: 1 and itself.\n### Case 1: \\( n-1 = 1 \\)\nIf \\( n-1 = 1 \\), then solving for \\( n \\):\n\\[\nn = 2\n\\]\nSubstituting \\( n = 2 \\) back into the expression:\n\\[\nn^2 - 3n + 2 = 2^2 - 3 \\times 2 + 2 = 4 - 6 + 2 = 0\n\\]\nThe result is 0, which is not prime.\n### Case 2: \\( n-2 = 1 \\)\nIf \\( n-2 = 1 \\), then solving for \\( n \\):\n\\[\nn = 3\n\\]\nSubstituting \\( n = 3 \\) back into the expression:\n\\[\nn^2 - 3n + 2 = 3^2 - 3 \\times 3 + 2 = 9 - 9 + 2 = 2\n\\]\nThe result is 2, which is prime.\n### Conclusion\nNow we check for any positive integers greater than 3.

        "To determine for how many positive integers \\( n \\) the expression \\( n^2 - 3n + 2 \\) is a prime number, we first simplify the expression.\nWe can factor it:\n\\[\nn^2 - 3n + 2 = (n-1)(n-2)\n\\]\nNext, we will analyze the product \\( (n-1)(n-2) \\).

Therefore, their product:\n\\[\n(n-1)(n-2) \\geq 2 \\cdot 2 = 4\n\\]\nwhich cannot be prime because any number greater than 2 is either composite or can be expressed as a product of smaller integers.\nLastly, we can check values of \\( n \\) less than 2 to confirm they do not yield primes:\n- For \\( n = 1 \\):\n  \\[\n  n^2 - 3n + 2 = 1^2 - 3 \\cdot 1 + 2 = 1 - 3 + 2 = 0\n  \\]\n  which is not prime.\nThus, the only positive integer \\( n \\) for which \\( n^2 - 3n + 2 \\) results in a prime number is \\( n = 3 \\).\nHence, the total number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that \\( n^2 - 3n + 2 \\) is a prime number is \n\\[\n\\boxed{1}.\n\\]",
