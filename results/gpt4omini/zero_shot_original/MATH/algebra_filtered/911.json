        "To solve for \\( y \\) in the arithmetic sequence given by \\( y + 6 \\), \\( 12 \\), and \\( y \\), we start by using the property of arithmetic sequences where the difference between consecutive terms is constant.\nLet's denote the terms of the sequence as follows:\n1. First term: \\( a_1 = y + 6 \\)\n2. Second term: \\( a_2 = 12 \\)\n3. Third term: \\( a_3 = y \\)\nIn an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms should be equal, i.e.,\n\\[\na_2 - a_1 = a_3 - a_2\n\\]\nSubstituting our terms into this equation, we have:\n\\[\n12 - (y + 6) = y - 12\n\\]\nNow, we will simplify each side of the equation:\n1.
