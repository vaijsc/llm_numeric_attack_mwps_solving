    "solution": "We know that $f(2)=9$. We can rewrite this as $f(-(-2))=9$, which shows that $(-2,9)$ must be on the graph of $y=f(-x)$. The sum of the coordinates of $(-2,9)$ is $\\boxed{7}$.\n\nAlternatively, note that the graphs of $y=f(x)$ and $y=f(-x)$ must be mirror images, with the $y$-axis being the axis of reflection. Thus, $(-2,9)$ is on the graph of $y=f(-x)$, and the sum of the coordinates of $(-2,9)$ is $\\boxed{7}$.",

        "If the point \\((2, 9)\\) is on the graph of \\(y = f(x)\\), this means that when \\(x = 2\\), the function \\(f\\) produces the output \\(y = 9\\). In mathematical terms, this can be expressed as:\n\\[\nf(2) = 9\n\\]\nTo find a corresponding point on the graph of \\(y = f(-x)\\), we need to examine how the function changes when we replace \\(x\\) with \\(-x\\). Specifically, we need to determine \\(f(-x)\\) when \\(x = 2\\). If we take \\(x = -2\\), we can analyze:\n\\[\nf(-(-2)) = f(2)\n\\]\nFrom the initial condition, we already know:\n\\[\nf(2) = 9\n\\]\nThus, we can see that:\n\\[\nf(-2) = f(2) = 9\n\\]\nSo the point \\((-2, 9)\\) must lie on the graph of \\(y = f(-x)\\).\nNow, we need to find the sum of the coordinates of the point \\((-2, 9)\\). The sum is calculated as follows:\n\\[\n-2 + 9 = 7\n\\]\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{7}\n\\]",
