        "To find the smallest integer value for \\( x \\) such that \\( f(x) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2x-6}}{x-3} \\) has a real number value, we need to consider the conditions under which the function is defined.\n1. **Condition for the Square Root**: The expression inside the square root, \\( 2x - 6 \\), must be non-negative for \\( \\sqrt{2x - 6} \\) to be real. Therefore, we set up the inequality:\n   \\[\n   2x - 6 \\geq 0\n   \\]\n   Solving this inequality:\n   \\[\n   2x \\geq 6 \\implies x \\geq 3\n   \\]\n2. **Condition for the Denominator**: The denominator \\( x - 3 \\) cannot be zero, so we must have:\n   \\[\n   x - 3 \\neq 0 \\implies x \\neq 3\n   \\]\nFrom the conditions above, we find that \\( x \\) must be greater than or equal to 3 but cannot be equal to 3. This leads us to conclude that:\n   \\[\n   x > 3\n   \\]\n3. **Finding the Smallest Integer**: The smallest integer greater than 3 is 4.\nThus, we check if \\( x = 4 \\) satisfies the conditions for \\( f(x) \\) to be a real number:\n- Whether \\( 2x - 6 \\) is non-negative with \\( x = 4 \\):\n  \\[\n  2(4) - 6 = 8 - 6 = 2 \\quad (\\text{which is non-negative})\n  \\]\n- Whether \\( x - 3 \\) is non-zero with \\( x = 4 \\):\n  \\[\n  4 - 3 = 1 \\quad (\\text{which is non-zero})\n  \\]\nSince both conditions are satisfied, the smallest possible integer value for \\( x \\) such that \\( f(x) \\) has a real number value is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{4}\n\\]",
