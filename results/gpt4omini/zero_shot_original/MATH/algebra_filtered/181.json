        "To find out how many years it will take for the tree to grow from its current height of 12 feet to 36 feet, we can follow these steps:\n1. **Determine the final height needed**: The tree needs to grow from 12 feet to 36 feet. \n2. **Calculate the height increase required**: \n   \\[\n   36 \\text{ feet} - 12 \\text{ feet} = 24 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n3. **Convert the height increase from feet to inches**: Since the tree grows in inches, we will convert 24 feet into inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:\n   \\[\n   24 \\text{ feet} \\times 12 \\text{ inches/foot} = 288 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n4. **Determine the annual growth in inches**: The tree grows 18 inches each year.\n5. **Calculate the number of years needed to grow 288 inches**:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{288 \\text{ inches}}{18 \\text{ inches/year}} = 16 \\text{ years}\n   \\]\nThus, it will take **16 years** for the tree to grow from 12 feet to 36 feet.",
        "To find out how many years it will take for the tree to grow from 12 feet to 36 feet, we can follow these steps:\n1. **Determine the target height**: The tree needs to grow from 12 feet to 36 feet.\n2. **Calculate the height increase needed**: \n   \\[\n   \\text{Height increase} = \\text{Target height} - \\text{Current height} = 36 \\text{ feet} - 12 \\text{ feet} = 24 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n3. **Convert the height increase from feet to inches**: \n   Since the tree grows in inches, we can convert 24 feet to inches (1 foot = 12 inches):\n   \\[\n   24 \\text{ feet} \\times 12 \\text{ inches/foot} = 288 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n4. **Determine the growth rate**: The tree grows 18 inches a year.\n5. **Calculate the number of years required to grow 288 inches**: \n   To find out how many years it will take, divide the total inches needed by the growth rate per year:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Years} = \\frac{\\text{Height increase in inches}}{\\text{Growth per year in inches}} = \\frac{288 \\text{ inches}}{18 \\text{ inches/year}} = 16 \\text{ years}\n   \\]\nTherefore, it will take **16 years** for the tree to grow from 12 feet to 36 feet.",
        "To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.\n1. **Current Height of the Tree**: The tree is currently 12 feet tall.\n2. **Target Height of the Tree**: We want the tree to reach a height of 36 feet.\n3. **Growth Rate**: The tree grows 18 inches a year.\nFirst, we need to convert the growth rate from inches to feet for consistency since the initial and target heights are in feet. \n- There are 12 inches in a foot, so to convert 18 inches to feet:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Growth Rate in feet} = \\frac{18 \\text{ inches}}{12 \\text{ inches/foot}} = 1.5 \\text{ feet}\n  \\]\n4. **Calculating the Required Growth**: We now determine how much more the tree needs to grow to reach 36 feet.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Height needed} = \\text{Target Height} - \\text{Current Height} = 36 \\text{ feet} - 12 \\text{ feet} = 24 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n5. **Determining the Number of Years**: Now, we need to find out how many years it will take for the tree to grow an additional 24 feet at a rate of 1.5 feet per year.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of Years} = \\frac{\\text{Height needed}}{\\text{Growth Rate}} = \\frac{24 \\text{ feet}}{1.5 \\text{ feet/year}} = 16 \\text{ years}\n   \\]\nTherefore, it will take **16 years** for the tree to grow from 12 feet to 36 feet.",
        "To determine how many years it will take for the tree to grow from its current height of 12 feet to a height of 36 feet, we can follow these steps:\n1. **Identify the current height of the tree**: The tree is currently 12 feet tall.\n2. **Determine the target height of the tree**: The target height is 36 feet.\n3. **Calculate the height difference**: \n   \\[\n   36 \\text{ feet} - 12 \\text{ feet} = 24 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n   This means the tree needs to grow 24 feet to reach the target height.\n4. **Convert the growth rate from inches to feet**: The tree grows 18 inches per year. To convert inches to feet, we know that there are 12 inches in a foot:\n   \\[\n   18 \\text{ inches} = \\frac{18}{12} \\text{ feet} = 1.5 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n   So, the tree grows 1.5 feet per year.\n5. **Calculate the number of years needed to grow 24 feet**: To find out how many years it takes to grow 24 feet at a rate of 1.5 feet per year, we divide the total growth needed by the growth per year:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{24 \\text{ feet}}{1.5 \\text{ feet per year}} = 16 \\text{ years}\n   \\]\nTherefore, it will take **16 years** for the tree to grow from 12 feet to 36 feet tall.",
        "To determine how many years it will take for a tree that is currently 12 feet tall to reach a height of 36 feet, given that it grows 18 inches per year, we can proceed through the following steps:\n1. **Convert the height of the tree from feet to inches:**  \n   Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, we need to convert the heights from feet to inches.\n   - Current height:  \n   \\( 12 \\text{ feet} = 12 \\times 12 = 144 \\text{ inches} \\)\n   - Desired height:  \n   \\( 36 \\text{ feet} = 36 \\times 12 = 432 \\text{ inches} \\)\n2. **Calculate the total growth needed:**  \n   Now, we find out how much taller the tree needs to grow to reach the desired height.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Growth Needed} = \\text{Desired Height} - \\text{Current Height}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 432 \\text{ inches} - 144 \\text{ inches} = 288 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n3. **Determine the growth rate in inches per year:**  \n   We know that the tree grows 18 inches per year.\n4. **Calculate the number of years required to reach the desired height:**  \n   We can find out how many years it will take to grow the needed height by dividing the total growth needed by the growth rate per year.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Years Required} = \\frac{\\text{Total Growth Needed}}{\\text{Growth Rate per Year}} = \\frac{288 \\text{ inches}}{18 \\text{ inches/year}}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 16 \\text{ years}\n   \\]\nThus, it will take **16 years** for the tree to grow from 12 feet to 36 feet tall."
