    "solution": "Since female students make up $\\frac{4}{9}$ of the total student body, multiply 396 by $\\frac{9}{4}$ to find how many students there are total.  That yields 891 students total, and since there are 11 times as many students, divide 891 by 11 to obtain $\\boxed{81\\text{ teachers}}$ total.",

        "Given the problem, we need to solve for the number of teachers in a school based on the provided ratios and the number of female students.\n1. **Identify the ratio of female students to total students**: \n   We know that the ratio of female students to total students is given as 4 to 9. This means that for every 4 female students, there are a total of 9 students.\n2. **Determine the total number of students**:\n   Let the total number of students be \\( S \\). According to the ratio, the fraction of female students is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{4}{9} = \\frac{396}{S}\n   \\]\n   We can solve for \\( S \\) by cross-multiplying:\n   \\[\n   4S = 9 \\times 396\n   \\]\n   First, we calculate \\( 9 \\times 396 \\):\n   \\[\n   9 \\times 396 = 3564\n   \\]\n   Thus, we have:\n   \\[\n   4S = 3564\n   \\]\n   To find \\( S \\), we divide by 4:\n   \\[\n   S = \\frac{3564}{4} = 891\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the total number of students is \\( S = 891 \\).\n3. **Determine the number of teachers**:\n   The ratio of teachers to students is given as 1 to 11. This means there is 1 teacher for every 11 students. If the total number of students is 891, we can find the number of teachers \\( T \\) using the ratio:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{T}{891} = \\frac{1}{11}\n   \\]\n   Cross-multiplying gives:\n   \\[\n   11T = 891\n   \\]\n   To find \\( T \\), we divide by 11:\n   \\[\n   T = \\frac{891}{11} = 81\n   \\]\n4. **Final answer**:\n   Therefore, the number of teachers in the school is \\( \\boxed{81} \\).",
        "To solve the problem step by step, we will start by understanding the information provided.\n1. **Ratio of teachers to students**: The ratio is 1:11. This means that for every 1 teacher, there are 11 students. \n2. **Ratio of female students to total students**: The ratio is 4:9. This means that for every 4 female students, there are 9 total students.\n3. **Total female students**: We are told there are 396 female students.\nNext, we need to calculate the total number of students in the school.\n4. **Finding the total number of students**: \n   - If the ratio of female students to total students is 4:9, we can express the total number of students (let's call it \\( S \\)) in terms of the number of female students.\n   - According to the ratio, if there are 4 parts that are female, the total consists of 9 parts. \n   - We can calculate the total number of students using the following proportion:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{Female Students}}{\\text{Total Students}} = \\frac{4}{9}\n\\]\nUsing the number of female students (396):\n\\[\n\\frac{396}{S} = \\frac{4}{9}\n\\]\nNow, cross-multiplying gives us:\n\\[\n4S = 9 \\times 396\n\\]\nCalculating the right-hand side:\n\\[\n9 \\times 396 = 3564\n\\]\nSo we have:\n\\[\n4S = 3564\n\\]\nNow, solving for \\( S \\):\n\\[\nS = \\frac{3564}{4} = 891\n\\]\nThus, the total number of students in the school is 891.\n5. **Finding the number of teachers**: Now that we know the total number of students, we can calculate the number of teachers using the ratio of teachers to students:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{Teachers}}{S} = \\frac{1}{11}\n\\]\nLet \\( T \\) be the number of teachers. Then, we can set up the equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{T}{891} = \\frac{1}{11}\n\\]\nCross-multiplying gives:\n\\[\n11T = 891\n\\]\nNow, solving for \\( T \\):\n\\[\nT = \\frac{891}{11} = 81\n\\]\nTherefore, the number of teachers in the school is \\( \\boxed{81} \\).",
        "To find the number of teachers in the school, we will break down the problem step by step.\n1. **Identify the total number of students using the ratio of female students to total students**:\n   The ratio of female students to total students is given as 4 to 9.

This means:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Teachers} : \\text{Students} = 1 : 11\n   \\]\n   Let \\( y \\) be the number of teachers. According to the ratio, we can express the number of students in terms of teachers as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Students} = 11y\n   \\]\n   We already found the total number of students is 891, so we set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   11y = 891\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( y \\):\n   \\[\n   y = \\frac{891}{11}\n   \\]\n   Calculate \\( 891 \\div 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   891 \\div 11 = 81\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the number of teachers is:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{81}\n   \\]",
