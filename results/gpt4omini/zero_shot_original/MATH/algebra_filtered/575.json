        "To determine the domain of the function \\( h(x) = \\sqrt{25 - x^2} + \\sqrt{-(x - 2)} \\), we need to examine the constraints imposed by each square root.\n1. **First square root: \\( \\sqrt{25 - x^2} \\)**\n   \n   For this square root to be defined, the expression inside must be non-negative:\n   \\[\n   25 - x^2 \\geq 0\n   \\]\n   Rearranging this inequality, we have:\n   \\[\n   x^2 \\leq 25\n   \\]\n   Taking square roots (considering both positive and negative roots), we find:\n   \\[\n   -5 \\leq x \\leq 5\n   \\]\n   So the first constraint gives us the interval \\([-5, 5]\\).\n2. **Second square root: \\( \\sqrt{-(x - 2)} \\)**\n   Similarly, we require the expression inside this square root to be non-negative:\n   \\[\n   -(x - 2) \\geq 0\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   x - 2 \\leq 0 \\implies x \\leq 2\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the second constraint gives us the interval \\((-\\infty, 2]\\).\n3. **Combining the intervals**\n   Now, we combine the intervals from the two constraints.
