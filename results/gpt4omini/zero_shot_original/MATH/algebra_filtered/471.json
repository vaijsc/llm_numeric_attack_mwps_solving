    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since 6 cookies cost the same as 2 brownies, 18 cookies will cost the same as 6 brownies.  Similarly, 4 brownies cost the same as 10 cupcakes, so 6 brownies will cost the same as $10\\cdot \\frac{6}{4} = 15$ cupcakes.  Therefore, 18 cookies have the same price as $\\boxed{15}$ cupcakes.",

        "Let's denote the prices of the cookies, brownies, and cupcakes as follows:\n- Let the price of one cookie be \\( C \\).\n- Let the price of one brownie be \\( B \\).\n- Let the price of one cupcake be \\( P \\).\nFrom the problem, we have two relationships:\n1. Six cookies cost the same as two brownies:\n   \\[\n   6C = 2B\n   \\]\n   Dividing both sides by 2 gives:\n   \\[\n   3C = B  \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)}\n   \\]\n2. Four brownies cost the same as ten cupcakes:\n   \\[\n   4B = 10P\n   \\]\n   Dividing both sides by 2 gives:\n   \\[\n   2B = 5P  \\quad \\text{(Equation 2)}\n   \\]\nNow, we want to find out how many cupcakes Bob can buy for the price of eighteen cookies.\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of eighteen cookies:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of } 18 \\text{ cookies} = 18C\n\\]\nNext, we'll express the price of a cupcake \\( P \\) in terms of \\( C \\) using the equations we've established.\nFrom Equation 1, we can find \\( B \\) in terms of \\( C \\):\n\\[\nB = 3C\n\\]\nSubstituting \\( B \\) from Equation 1 into Equation 2:\n\\[\n2(3C) = 5P\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n6C = 5P\n\\]\nNow, let's solve for \\( P \\):\n\\[\nP = \\frac{6C}{5}\n\\]\nNow we can find out how many cupcakes Bob can buy for the price of eighteen cookies. We need to divide the total cost of eighteen cookies by the cost of one cupcake:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of cupcakes} = \\frac{18C}{P}\n\\]\nSubstituting \\( P \\) into the equation:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of cupcakes} = \\frac{18C}{\\frac{6C}{5}} = 18C \\times \\frac{5}{6C}\n\\]\nThe \\( C \\) cancels out:\n\\[\n= 18 \\times \\frac{5}{6} = 3 \\times 5 = 15\n\\]\nThus, Bob can buy a total of **15 cupcakes** for the price of eighteen cookies.",
        "Let's break down the problem step by step.\n1. **Establish the equations based on the given information**:\n   - Let the price of one cookie be \\( C \\).\n   - Let the price of one brownie be \\( B \\).\n   - Let the price of one cupcake be \\( P \\).\n   According to the problem:\n   - Six cookies cost the same as two brownies:\n     \\[\n     6C = 2B\n     \\]\n     Dividing both sides by 2 gives:\n     \\[\n     3C = B \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)}\n     \\]\n   - Four brownies cost the same as ten cupcakes:\n     \\[\n     4B = 10P\n     \\]\n     Dividing both sides by 2 gives:\n     \\[\n     2B = 5P \\quad \\text{(Equation 2)}\n     \\]\n2. **Substituting Equation 1 into Equation 2**:\n   We can substitute the expression for \\( B \\) from Equation 1 into Equation 2. From Equation 1, we have \\( B = 3C \\).

To find out how many cupcakes can be bought, we divide the total amount by the price of one cupcake:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of cupcakes} = \\frac{18C}{P}\n   \\]\n   Now, substituting \\( P \\) from Equation 3:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of cupcakes} = \\frac{18C}{\\frac{6C}{5}} = 18C \\cdot \\frac{5}{6C}\n   \\]\n   The \\( C \\) cancels out:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of cupcakes} = 18 \\cdot \\frac{5}{6} = 3 \\cdot 5 = 15\n   \\]\nTherefore, Bob can buy **15 cupcakes** for the price of eighteen cookies.",
