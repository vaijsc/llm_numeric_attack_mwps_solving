    "solution": "The store's revenue is given by: number of books sold $\\times$ price of each book, or\n\\[p(120-3p)=120p-3p^2.\\]We want to maximize this expression by completing the square. We can factor out a $-3$ to get $-3(p^2-40p)$.\n\nTo complete the square, we add $(40/2)^2=400$ inside the parenthesis and subtract $-3\\cdot400=-1200$ outside. We are left with the expression\n\\[-3(p^2-40p+400)+1200=-3(p-20)^2+1200.\\]Note that the $-3(p-20)^2$ term will always be nonpositive since the perfect square is always nonnegative. Thus, the revenue is maximized when $-3(p-20)^2$ equals 0, which is when $p=20$. Thus, the store should charge $\\boxed{20}$ dollars for the book.",

        "To maximize the bookstore's revenue, we need to express the revenue \\( R \\) as a function of the price \\( p \\).\n1. **Define revenue**: The revenue \\( R \\) is calculated as the product of the price per book and the number of books sold.
