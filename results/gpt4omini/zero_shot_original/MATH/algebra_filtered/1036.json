        "To find the sum of the next two terms in the given geometric sequence \\(1, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{8}, \\ldots\\), we first need to identify a few key elements of the sequence.\n### Step 1: Determine the common ratio of the sequence\nA geometric sequence has the characteristic that each term can be derived from the previous term by multiplying by a constant, called the common ratio. \nLet's calculate the common ratio \\(r\\):\n\\[\nr = \\frac{\\text{second term}}{\\text{first term}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{1} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\nWe can check this by calculating the ratio between other consecutive terms:\n\\[\nr = \\frac{\\frac{1}{4}}{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{1/4}{1/2} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{2}{1} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nr = \\frac{\\frac{1}{8}}{\\frac{1}{4}} = \\frac{1/8}{1/4} = \\frac{1}{8} \\times \\frac{4}{1} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\nThus, the common ratio \\(r\\) is indeed \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n### Step 2: Calculate the next two terms\nStarting from the last known term, \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\):\n1. The next term can be calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{fifth term} = \\text{fourth term} \\times r = \\frac{1}{8} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{16}\n   \\]\n2. The sixth term can then be calculated similarly:\n   \\[\n   \\text{sixth term} = \\text{fifth term} \\times r = \\frac{1}{16} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{32}\n   \\]\n### Step 3: Find the sum of the next two terms\nNow that we have the fifth and sixth terms, which are \\( \\frac{1}{16} \\) and \\( \\frac{1}{32} \\), we can calculate their sum:\n\\[\n\\text{Sum} = \\frac{1}{16} + \\frac{1}{32}\n\\]\nTo add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common denominator (LCD) of 16 and 32 is 32.\nWe can rewrite \\( \\frac{1}{16} \\) as:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{2}{32}\n\\]\nNow we can add them:\n\\[\n\\text{Sum} = \\frac{2}{32} + \\frac{1}{32} = \\frac{2 + 1}{32} = \\frac{3}{32}\n\\]\n### Final Result\nThus, the sum of the next two terms in the sequence is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{3}{32}}\n\\]",
