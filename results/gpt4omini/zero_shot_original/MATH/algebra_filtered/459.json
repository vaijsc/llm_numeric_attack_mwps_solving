        "To solve the equation \\( |2 - x| = 3 \\), we need to consider the definition of absolute value. The equation \\( |A| = B \\) translates to two cases: \\( A = B \\) and \\( A = -B \\). Here, our expression is \\( 2 - x \\) and \\( B \\) is 3. So, we can break it down into two cases:\n**Case 1:**\n\\[\n2 - x = 3\n\\]\nTo solve for \\( x \\), we can rearrange the equation:\n\\[\n-x = 3 - 2\n\\]\n\\[\n-x = 1\n\\]\nMultiplying both sides by -1 gives us:\n\\[\nx = -1\n\\]\n**Case 2:**\n\\[\n2 - x = -3\n\\]\nAgain, we'll rearrange this equation:\n\\[\n-x = -3 - 2\n\\]\n\\[\n-x = -5\n\\]\nMultiplying both sides by -1 results in:\n\\[\nx = 5\n\\]\nNow we have found two solutions: \\( x = -1 \\) and \\( x = 5 \\).\nNext, we need to calculate the sum of all solutions:\n\\[\n-1 + 5 = 4\n\\]\nThus, the sum of all solutions of the equation \\( |2 - x| = 3 \\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{4}\n\\]",
