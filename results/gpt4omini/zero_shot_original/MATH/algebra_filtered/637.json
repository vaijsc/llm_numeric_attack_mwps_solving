    "solution": "Let $C$ be the cost of carpeting a floor and $A$ be the area.  By the definition of a direct proportion, we know that $C=kA$, where $k$ is a constant.  Substituting $105$ for $C$ and $14\\times 5=70$ for $A$, we can find that $k=3/2$.  Then, the cost to carpet a floor that is $16\\times13$ square feet will be: \\begin{align*}\nC&=kA\\\\\n&=(3/2)(16\\times13)\\\\\n&=\\boxed{312 \\text{ dollars}}.\n\\end{align*}",

        "To solve the problem, we first need to determine the cost per square foot of carpeting and then use that to find out the cost for a different area. \n1. **Calculate the area of the first floor:**\n   The dimensions of the first floor are \\(14 \\times 5\\) square feet.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area}_1 = 14 \\times 5 = 70 \\text{ square feet}\n   \\]\n2. **Cost of carpeting the first floor:**\n   The cost to carpet this area is given as $105.\n3. **Calculate the cost per square foot:**\n   To find the cost per square foot, we divide the total cost by the area:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost per square foot} = \\frac{105}{70}\n   \\]\n   Calculating that gives:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost per square foot} = 1.5 \\text{ dollars/sq ft}\n   \\]\n4. **Calculate the area of the second floor:**\n   The dimensions of the second floor are \\(16 \\times 13\\) square feet.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area}_2 = 16 \\times 13 = 208 \\text{ square feet}\n   \\]\n5. **Calculate the total cost to carpet the second floor:**\n   Now, we multiply the area of the second floor by the cost per square foot to get the total cost:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = \\text{Area}_2 \\times \\text{Cost per square foot} = 208 \\times 1.5\n   \\]\n   Calculating this gives:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = 312 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\nThus, the cost to carpet a floor that is \\(16 \\times 13\\) square feet is \\(\\boxed{312}\\) dollars.",

The relationship can be expressed as:\n\\[\nC = k \\cdot A\n\\]\nwhere \\(k\\) is the constant of proportionality.
