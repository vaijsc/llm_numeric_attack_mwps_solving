        "To find the sum of the first five positive odd integers, we can first identify these integers. The first five positive odd integers are:\n1. 1\n2. 3\n3. 5\n4. 7\n5. 9\nNext, we can add these integers together step by step:\n1. Start with the first two integers:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n2. Now add the next integer:\n   \\[\n   4 + 5 = 9\n   \\]\n3. Then add the fourth integer:\n   \\[\n   9 + 7 = 16\n   \\]\n4. Finally, add the last integer:\n   \\[\n   16 + 9 = 25\n   \\]\nThus, the sum of the first five positive odd integers is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{25}\n\\]",
