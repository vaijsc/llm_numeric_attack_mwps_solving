        "To determine how far the ball will have traveled when it hits the floor for the sixth time, we can break the journey down into steps:\n1. **Fall from the initial height**: The ball drops from 16 feet. The distance traveled during this first fall is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{First fall} = 16 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n2. **First bounce**: After hitting the ground, it bounces back up to half of 16 feet. The height of the first bounce is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{First bounce height} = \\frac{16}{2} = 8 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n3. **Second fall**: The ball then falls again from 8 feet to the ground. The distance for this fall is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Second fall} = 8 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n4. **Second bounce**: It bounces back to half the height of the previous fall:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Second bounce height} = \\frac{8}{2} = 4 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n5. **Third fall**: The ball falls from 4 feet back to the ground:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Third fall} = 4 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n6. **Third bounce**: It bounces back to half the previous height:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Third bounce height} = \\frac{4}{2} = 2 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n7. **Fourth fall**: The ball falls 2 feet back to the ground:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Fourth fall} = 2 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n8. **Fourth bounce**: The ball bounces back to half the previous height:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Fourth bounce height} = \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\text{ foot}\n   \\]\n9. **Fifth fall**: The ball falls 1 foot back to the ground:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Fifth fall} = 1 \\text{ foot}\n   \\]\n10. **Fifth bounce**: The ball bounces back to half the previous height:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Fifth bounce height} = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \\text{ feet}\n    \\]\n11. **Sixth fall**: The ball falls 0.5 feet back to the ground:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Sixth fall} = 0.5 \\text{ feet}\n    \\]\nAt this point, the ball has hit the ground for the sixth time. Now we can sum up all the traveled distances:\n- Total distance traveled \\( = \\) Distance of all falls \\( + \\) Distance of all bounces:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Total distance} = (16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 0.5) + (8 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 0.5)\n  \\]\nCalculating this step-by-step:\n1. Distance of falls:\n   - \\( 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 0.5 = 31.5 \\text{ feet} \\)\n2. Distance of bounces:\n   - The balls bounces back up after the first fall and down again, we only consider the heights until it hits the ground for the sixth time (which is the height after the fifth fall):\n   - \\( 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 0.5 = 15.5 \\text{ feet} \\)\n3. Total distance traveled:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total distance} = 31.5 + 15.5 = 47 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\nThus, the total distance traveled by the ball when it hits the floor for the sixth time is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{47} \\text{ feet}\n\\]",
        "To determine the total distance traveled by the ball by the time it hits the floor for the sixth time, we need to analyze the sequence of bounces and falls.\n1. **Initial drop**: The ball is initially dropped from a height of 16 feet.\n   - **Distance traveled**: 16 feet (down)\n2. **First bounce**: The ball bounces back to a height of half the height from which it fell. \n   - New height = \\( \\frac{16}{2} = 8 \\) feet. \n   - **Distance traveled**: 8 feet (up)\n3. **Second fall**: The ball falls from the height of 8 feet.\n   - **Distance traveled**: 8 feet (down)\n4. **Second bounce**: The ball then bounces back to half of the 8 feet height.\n   - New height = \\( \\frac{8}{2} = 4 \\) feet. \n   - **Distance traveled**: 4 feet (up)\n5. **Third fall**: The ball falls from the height of 4 feet.\n   - **Distance traveled**: 4 feet (down)\n6. **Third bounce**: The ball bounces back to half of the 4 feet height.\n   - New height = \\( \\frac{4}{2} = 2 \\) feet. \n   - **Distance traveled**: 2 feet (up)\n7. **Fourth fall**: The ball falls from the height of 2 feet.\n   - **Distance traveled**: 2 feet (down)\n8. **Fourth bounce**: The ball bounces back to half of the 2 feet height.\n   - New height = \\( \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\) foot. \n   - **Distance traveled**: 1 foot (up)\n9. **Fifth fall**: The ball falls from the height of 1 foot.\n   - **Distance traveled**: 1 foot (down)\n10. **Fifth bounce**: The ball bounces back to half of the 1-foot height.\n    - New height = \\( \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \\) feet.\n    - **Distance traveled**: 0.5 feet (up)\n11. **Sixth fall**: The ball falls from the height of 0.5 feet.\n    - **Distance traveled**: 0.5 feet (down)\nNow, we sum up all the distances to calculate the total distance traveled by the ball when it hits the floor for the sixth time:\n- **Total Distance** = Distance down (drop) + Distance up (1st bounce) + Distance down (1st fall) + Distance up (2nd bounce) + Distance down (2nd fall) + Distance up (3rd bounce) + Distance down (3rd fall) + Distance up (4th bounce) + Distance down (4th fall) + Distance up (5th bounce) + Distance down (5th fall) + Distance up (6th bounce) + Distance down (6th fall)\nCalculating this gives:\n\\[\n\\text{Total Distance} = 16 + 8 + 8 + 4 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 16 + 16 + 8 + 2 + 1 = 43\n\\]\nThus, the total distance traveled by the ball when it hits the floor for the sixth time is **43 feet**.",
        "To determine how far the ball has traveled when it hits the floor for the sixth time, we can break down the sequence of bounces step by step.\n1. **First Drop:** The ball is dropped from a height of 16 feet.\n   - Distance traveled: 16 feet (falling downwards)\n2. **First Bounce:** The ball bounces back to a height of half its previous height:\n   - Height after bounce = \\( \\frac{16}{2} = 8 \\) feet\n   - Distance traveled: 8 feet (going upwards)\n3. **Second Drop:** The ball then drops from that height back to the floor.\n   - Distance traveled: 8 feet (falling downwards)\n4. **Second Bounce:** The ball bounces back to half of the height it just fell:\n   - Height after bounce = \\( \\frac{8}{2} = 4 \\) feet\n   - Distance traveled: 4 feet (going upwards)\n5. **Third Drop:** The ball drops again from that bounce height:\n   - Distance traveled: 4 feet (falling downwards)\n6. **Third Bounce:** The ball bounces back to half the height it just fell:\n   - Height after bounce = \\( \\frac{4}{2} = 2 \\) feet\n   - Distance traveled: 2 feet (going upwards)\n7. **Fourth Drop:** The ball drops from that bounce height to the floor again:\n   - Distance traveled: 2 feet (falling downwards)\n8. **Fourth Bounce:** It bounces back to half the height:\n   - Height after bounce = \\( \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\) foot\n   - Distance traveled: 1 foot (going upwards)\n9. **Fifth Drop:** The ball drops down from this height:\n   - Distance traveled: 1 foot (falling downwards)\n10. **Fifth Bounce:** The ball then bounces back to half the height:\n    - Height after bounce = \\( \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \\) foot\n    - Distance traveled: 0.5 feet (going upwards)\n11. **Sixth Drop:** Finally, the ball drops down from this bounce height:\n    - Distance traveled: 0.5 feet (falling downwards)\nNext, we calculate the total distance traveled by adding all the distances we have noted:\n- Distance from drops: \\( 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 0.5 = 31.5 \\) feet\n- Distance from bounces: \\( 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 0.5 = 15.5 \\) feet\nNow, we will add both totals to get the complete distance:\n\\[\n\\text{Total Distance} = \\text{Distance from drops} + \\text{Distance from bounces}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Total Distance} = 31.5 + 15.5 = 47 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\nThus, the total distance traveled by the ball when it hits the floor for the sixth time is **47 feet**.",
