    "solution": "Let $f$ be the number of free hours per month, and let $c$ be the cost for each extra hour, in dollars.  Wells and Ted together have $2f$ free hours, so they used $105-2f$ extra hours.  Since the cost for each extra hour is $c$ dollars, we are given $c(105-2f)=10$.  Similarly, Vino's bill implies $c(105-f)=26$.  Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we find $fc=16$.  Rewrite the second equation as $105c-fc=26$, substitute 16 for $fc$, and solve to get $c=2/5$.  Two-fifths of a dollar is $\\boxed{40}$ cents.",

        "To determine the number of cents charged for each extra hour, we'll first set up the information given in the problem.\nLet:\n- \\( f \\): the number of free hours allowed by the Internet service provider,\n- \\( c \\): the charge in dollars for each extra hour used.\n1. **Wells and Ted's usage**:\n   - Wells and Ted used a total of 105 hours together.\n   - They each used all their free hours, thus their total usage beyond free hours is \\( 105 - 2f \\) (assuming both used \\( f \\) free hours).\n   - Since their total cost was \\$10:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost for Wells and Ted} = c \\times (105 - 2f) = 10\n   \\]\n   Therefore, we have:\n   \\[\n   c(105 - 2f) = 10 \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)}\n   \\]\n2. **Vino's usage**:\n   - Vino used 105 hours by himself.\n   - Thus, Vino incurred a charge for his extra hours which can be calculated as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost for Vino} = c \\times (105 - f) = 26\n   \\]\n   Therefore, we have:\n   \\[\n   c(105 - f) = 26 \\quad \\text{(Equation 2)}\n   \\]\nNow we have two equations:\n1. \\( c(105 - 2f) = 10 \\)\n2. \\( c(105 - f) = 26 \\)\n### Step 1: Express \\( c \\) in terms of \\( f \\)\nFrom Equation 1, we can express \\( c \\):\n\\[\nc = \\frac{10}{105 - 2f} \\quad \\text{(Equation 3)}\n\\]\nFrom Equation 2, we can substitute \\( c \\):\n\\[\nc = \\frac{26}{105 - f} \\quad \\text{(Equation 4)}\n\\]\n### Step 2: Set the two equations for \\( c \\) equal to each other\nSetting Equation 3 equal to Equation 4 gives us:\n\\[\n\\frac{10}{105 - 2f} = \\frac{26}{105 - f}\n\\]\n### Step 3: Cross-multiply to solve for \\( f \\)\nCross-multiplying yields:\n\\[\n10(105 - f) = 26(105 - 2f)\n\\]\nExpanding both sides:\n\\[\n1050 - 10f = 2730 - 52f\n\\]\n### Step 4: Rearranging\nRearrange the equation:\n\\[\n52f - 10f = 2730 - 1050\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n42f = 1680\n\\]\n### Step 5: Solve for \\( f \\)\nDividing both sides by 42:\n\\[\nf = \\frac{1680}{42} = 40\n\\]\n### Step 6: Substitute \\( f \\) back to find \\( c \\)\nSubstituting \\( f = 40 \\) into Equation 3 or Equation 4 to find \\( c \\):\nUsing Equation 3:\n\\[\nc = \\frac{10}{105 - 2 \\times 40} = \\frac{10}{105 - 80} = \\frac{10}{25} = 0.4\n\\]\n### Step 7: Calculate the charge per extra hour in cents\nSince \\( c \\) is in dollars, to find the charge in cents, we convert:\n\\[\nc = 0.4 \\text{ dollars} = 0.4 \\times 100 = 40 \\text{ cents}\n\\]\nThus, the number of cents charged for each extra hour is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{40}\n\\]",
