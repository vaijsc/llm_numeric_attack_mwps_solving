        "To determine the sum of all of the counting numbers in column \\( E \\) from the arrangement given, we first need to analyze the structure of how the numbers are filled in the columns.\nFrom the tabular structure presented, we can observe the following pattern:\n- The first row contains numbers \\( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \\) (which are the first five numbers).\n- The second row contains numbers \\( 10, 9, 8, 7, 6 \\) (which consists of the next five numbers but in reverse order).\n- The third row includes \\( 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 \\), and so forth, continuing this alternating pattern of increasing row numbers and alternating orders.\nThe arrangement can be broken down into groups or blocks of 10 rows where the first block consists of:\n- Row 1: \\( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \\)\n- Row 2: \\( 10, 9, 8, 7, 6 \\)\n- Row 3: \\( 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 \\)\n- Row 4: \\( 20, 19, 18, 17, 16 \\)\n- And so on until we reach \\( 50 \\).\nNext, we need to figure out which numbers will appear in column \\( E \\). Within each complete block of 10 rows, the contents of column \\( E \\) are as follows:\n1. Row 1, Column E: \\( 5 \\)\n2. Row 2, Column E: \\( 6 \\)\n3. Row 3, Column E: \\( 15 \\)\n4. Row 4, Column E: \\( 16 \\)\nContinuing the pattern, it can be generalized that:\n- In odd-numbered rows, \\( E \\) contains numbers that can be expressed as \\( 5, 15, 25, 35, 45 \\).\n- In even-numbered rows, \\( E \\) contains numbers that can be expressed as \\( 6, 16, 26, 36, 46 \\).\nTo list out all of the values in column \\( E \\):\n- The first row contributes \\( 5 \\),\n- The second row contributes \\( 6 \\),\n- The third row contributes \\( 15 \\),\n- The fourth row contributes \\( 16 \\),\n- The fifth row contributes \\( 25 \\),\n- The sixth row contributes \\( 26 \\),\n- The seventh row contributes \\( 35 \\),\n- The eighth row contributes \\( 36 \\),\n- The ninth row contributes \\( 45 \\),\n- The tenth row contributes \\( 46 \\).\nThis gives us the complete set of numbers in column \\( E \\):\n\\[\n5, 6, 15, 16, 25, 26, 35, 36, 45, 46\n\\]\nNow, we will compute the sum of these numbers:\n\\[\n5 + 6 + 15 + 16 + 25 + 26 + 35 + 36 + 45 + 46\n\\]\nCalculating this step-by-step:\n- \\( 5 + 6 = 11 \\)\n- \\( 11 + 15 = 26 \\)\n- \\( 26 + 16 = 42 \\)\n- \\( 42 + 25 = 67 \\)\n- \\( 67 + 26 = 93 \\)\n- \\( 93 + 35 = 128 \\)\n- \\( 128 + 36 = 164 \\)\n- \\( 164 + 45 = 209 \\)\n- \\( 209 + 46 = 255 \\)\nThus, the sum of all the counting numbers in column \\( E \\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{255}\n\\]",
        "To understand how the first 50 counting numbers are arranged in columns, let's examine the pattern based on the provided grid. \nThe numbers are placed into columns as follows:\n- The first row has numbers 1 to 5.\n- The second row goes from 10 down to 6.\n- The third row goes from 11 to 15.\n- The fourth row goes from 20 down to 16.\nContinuing this pattern, we can construct the arrangement step by step:\n1. The odd-numbered rows (1st, 3rd, 5th, ...) contain increasing sequences of 5 numbers starting from a certain point.\n2. The even-numbered rows (2nd, 4th, 6th, ...) contain decreasing sequences of 5 numbers starting from a certain point.\nFor the columns we are interested in:\n- **Column A**: 1, 10, 11, 20, ...\n- **Column B**: 2, 9, 12, 19, ...\n- **Column C**: 3, 8, 13, 18, ...\n- **Column D**: 4, 7, 14, 17, ...\n- **Column E**: 5, 6, 15, 16, ...\nNext, let's determine the values in **Column E** based on the patterns established:\n### Identifying Values in Column E:\n- **Row 1**: 5\n- **Row 2**: 6\n- **Row 3**: 15\n- **Row 4**: 16\n- Continue this for additional rows...\n### Observing the Values:\nFollowing the established pattern:\n- Row 1: \\(5\\)\n- Row 2: \\(6\\)\n- Row 3: \\(15\\)\n- Row 4: \\(16\\)\n- Row 5: From the sequence, we find \\(25\\).\n- Row 6: From the sequence, we find \\(26\\).\n- Row 7: From the sequence, we find \\(35\\).\n- Row 8: From the sequence, we find \\(36\\).\nThus, we can summarize the numbers in Column E:\n- Up to \\(50\\): \\(5, 6, 15, 16, 25, 26, 35, 36, 45, 46\\).\n### Sum of Values in Column E:\nNow we calculate the sum:\n- \\(5 + 6 + 15 + 16 + 25 + 26 + 35 + 36 + 45 + 46\\)\nCalculating stepwise:\n- \\(5 + 6 = 11\\)\n- \\(11 + 15 = 26\\)\n- \\(26 + 16 = 42\\)\n- \\(42 + 25 = 67\\)\n- \\(67 + 26 = 93\\)\n- \\(93 + 35 = 128\\)\n- \\(128 + 36 = 164\\)\n- \\(164 + 45 = 209\\)\n- \\(209 + 46 = 255\\)\nTherefore, the total sum of all of the counting numbers in column E is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{255}\n\\]",
