    "solution": "If $x+4\\geq 0$ (or $x\\geq -4$), then the given inequality is the same as $x+4<9$ which means $x<5$. If $x+4<0$ (or $x<-4$), we have $-(x+4)<9$ which means $x+4>-9$ which yields $x>-13$. Thus, the solution is $-13<x<5$. Thus, the integers in this solution are -1 through -12 (12 integers), 1 through 4 (4 integers), and 0 (1 integer). Thus, the total is $12+4+1=\\boxed{17}$ integers.",

        "To solve the inequality \\( |x + 4| < 9 \\), we start by rewriting the absolute value inequality into a double inequality. The expression \\( |x + 4| < 9 \\) means that the expression \\( x + 4 \\) must be between \\(-9\\) and \\(9\\). Mathematically, we can express this as:\n\\[\n-9 < x + 4 < 9\n\\]\nNext, we can solve the two inequalities separately.\n1. Solve the left part of the double inequality:\n   \\[\n   -9 < x + 4\n   \\]\n   To isolate \\(x\\), we subtract \\(4\\) from both sides:\n   \\[\n   -9 - 4 < x \\implies -13 < x \\implies x > -13\n   \\]\n2. Solve the right part of the double inequality:\n   \\[\n   x + 4 < 9\n   \\]\n   Again, subtract \\(4\\) from both sides:\n   \\[\n   x < 9 - 4 \\implies x < 5\n   \\]\nNow we have the combined inequality:\n\\[\n-13 < x < 5\n\\]\nNext, we will determine the integers that satisfy this inequality. The integers in this interval are those that are greater than \\(-13\\) and less than \\(5\\). We list the integers:\n\\[\n-12, -11, -10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\n\\]\nNow we count the integers: \n- The first integer greater than \\(-13\\) is \\(-12\\).\n- The last integer less than \\(5\\) is \\(4\\).\nTo count the total number of integers, we proceed as follows:\n- The set of integers from \\(-12\\) to \\(4\\) can be counted using the formula for the count of integers in an inclusive range, which is given by:\n\\[\n\\text{count} = (\\text{last integer} - \\text{first integer}) + 1\n\\]\nHere, the last integer is \\(4\\) and the first integer is \\(-12\\):\n\\[\n\\text{count} = (4 - (-12)) + 1 = (4 + 12) + 1 = 16 + 1 = 17\n\\]\nThus, the total number of integers that satisfy the inequality \\( |x + 4| < 9 \\) is \n\\[\n\\boxed{17}\n\\]",
        "To solve the inequality \\( |x + 4| < 9 \\), we can first rewrite it in terms of a double inequality.\nThe expression \\( |x + 4| < 9 \\) means that the value of \\( x + 4 \\) is less than 9 units away from 0. This can be translated into the following double inequality:\n\\[\n-9 < x + 4 < 9\n\\]\nNext, we will isolate \\( x \\) by subtracting 4 from all parts of the inequality:\n\\[\n-9 - 4 < x < 9 - 4\n\\]\nCalculating the left and right sides gives:\n\\[\n-13 < x < 5\n\\]\nNow the inequality \\( -13 < x < 5 \\) tells us that \\( x \\) can take any value between -13 and 5, but not including -13 and 5 themselves.\nNext, we want to find all the integers that satisfy this inequality.
