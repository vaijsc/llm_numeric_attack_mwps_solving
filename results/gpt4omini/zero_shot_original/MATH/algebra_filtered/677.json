        "To find the value of \\( xy \\) given the equations \\( (x + y)^2 = 105 \\) and \\( x^2 + y^2 = 65 \\), we can start by expanding the first equation.\n1. The equation \\( (x + y)^2 = 105 \\) can be expanded as:\n   \\[\n   (x + y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\( x^2 + y^2 = 65 \\) into this equation gives us:\n   \\[\n   105 = 65 + 2xy\n   \\]\n2. Next, we can isolate \\( 2xy \\) by subtracting 65 from both sides:\n   \\[\n   105 - 65 = 2xy\n   \\]\n   Which simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   40 = 2xy\n   \\]\n3. Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \\( xy \\):\n   \\[\n   xy = \\frac{40}{2} = 20\n   \\]\nThus, the value of \\( xy \\) is \\( \\boxed{20} \\).",
        "To solve for \\( xy \\) given the equations \\((x + y)^2 = 105\\) and \\(x^2 + y^2 = 65\\), we can use some algebraic identities and manipulate the equations step by step.\n1. Start with the identity of the square of a sum:\n   \\[\n   (x + y)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + 2xy\n   \\]\n   We know that \\((x + y)^2 = 105\\) and \\(x^2 + y^2 = 65\\). \n2. Substitute the second equation into the first:\n   \\[\n   105 = 65 + 2xy\n   \\]\n3. Rearranging this equation gives:\n   \\[\n   2xy = 105 - 65\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   2xy = 40\n   \\]\n4.
