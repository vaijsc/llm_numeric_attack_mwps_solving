    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We don't know the $y$-intercept, so let the $y$-intercept be $a$, where $1\\le a \\le 9$. Our line contains the points $(0,a)$ and $(4,365)$, so its slope is $\\frac{365-a}{4-0}=\\frac{365-a}{4}$. We are trying to find the smallest possible value of this expression, to minimize the slope. The denominator is fixed, so we must find the smallest possible value of the numerator, $365-a$. The smallest value will occur when $a$ is as large as possible, so $a=9$. Then the slope will be $\\frac{365-9}{4}=\\frac{356}{4}=\\boxed{89}$.",

        "To find the minimum possible slope of a line that passes through the point \\((4, 365)\\) and has a \\(y\\)-intercept between \\(1\\) and \\(9\\), we start by using the line's slope-intercept form of the equation:\n\\[\ny = mx + b\n\\]\nwhere \\(m\\) is the slope and \\(b\\) is the \\(y\\)-intercept.
