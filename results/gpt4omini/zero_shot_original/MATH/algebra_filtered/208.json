    "solution": "Let $d$ be the common difference, so $a = b - d$ and $c = b + d$.  We can assume that $d$ is positive.  (In particular, $d$ can't be 0, because the triangle is not equilateral.)  Then the perimeter of the triangle is $a + b + c = (b - d) + b + (b + d) = 3b = 60$, so $b = 20$.  Hence, the sides of the triangle are $20 - d$, 20, and $20 + d$.\n\nThese sides must satisfy the triangle inequality, which gives us \\[(20 - d) + 20 > 20 + d.\\] Solving for $d$, we find $2d < 20$, or $d < 10$.  Therefore, the possible values of $d$ are 1, 2, $\\dots$, 9, which gives us $\\boxed{9}$ possible triangles.",

        "To find the distinct, non-equilateral triangles with a perimeter of 60 units where the side lengths \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) form an arithmetic sequence, we start by expressing the side lengths in terms of a variable \\( d \\).\nSince \\( a, b, c \\) are in an arithmetic sequence, we can denote the lengths as follows:\n- Let \\( b \\) be the middle term, so we can write:\n  \\[\n  a = b - d, \\quad b = b, \\quad c = b + d\n  \\]\nfor some integer \\( d > 0 \\) (to ensure they are not equal and form a non-equilateral triangle).\nThe perimeter condition gives us:\n\\[\na + b + c = (b - d) + b + (b + d) = 3b = 60.\n\\]\nThus, we find:\n\\[\nb = \\frac{60}{3} = 20.\n\\]\nNow substituting \\( b \\) back into the expressions for \\( a \\) and \\( c \\):\n\\[\na = 20 - d, \\quad c = 20 + d.\n\\]\nNext, we need to apply the triangle inequality constraints:\n1. \\( a + b > c \\):\n   \\[\n   (20 - d) + 20 > (20 + d) \\implies 40 - d > 20 + d \\implies 20 > 2d \\implies d < 10.\n   \\]\n  \n2. \\( a + c > b \\):\n   \\[\n   (20 - d) + (20 + d) > 20 \\implies 40 > 20, \\  \\text{which is always true.} \n   \\]\n3. \\( b + c > a \\):\n   \\[\n   20 + (20 + d) > (20 - d) \\implies 40 + d > 20 - d \\implies 20 + 2d > 0, \\  \\text{which is always true for } d > 0.\n   \\]\nFrom the first inequality, we conclude that \\( d \\) can take integer values in the set:\n\\[\n1 \\leq d < 10.\n\\]\nThis gives us the integer values for \\( d \\):\n- \\( d = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 \\).\nSince \\( d \\) must be a positive integer, \\( d \\) can take on exactly 9 values: \\( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 \\).\nThus, there are 9 distinct non-equilateral triangles that can be formed with side lengths in an arithmetic sequence with a perimeter of 60.\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{9}.\n\\]",
        "To find the distinct, non-equilateral triangles with integer side lengths \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) that form an arithmetic sequence with a perimeter of 60 units, we will proceed through the following steps:\n1. **Understanding the Condition**: If \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are in an arithmetic sequence, we can express them as:\n   \\[\n   a = b - d, \\quad b = b, \\quad c = b + d\n   \\]\n   for some integer \\(d\\). Here, \\(b\\) is the middle term and \\(d\\) is the common difference.\n2. **Setting Up the Perimeter Equation**: The perimeter of the triangle is:\n   \\[\n   a + b + c = (b - d) + b + (b + d) = 3b = 60\n   \\]\n   This gives us:\n   \\[\n   b = 20\n   \\]\n3. **Determining the Side Lengths**: Consequently, we can denote the side lengths as:\n   \\[\n   a = 20 - d, \\quad b = 20, \\quad c = 20 + d\n   \\]\n4. **Triangle Inequality Constraints**: We need to ensure that the triangle inequalities are satisfied:\n   - \\(a + b > c\\):\n     \\[\n     (20 - d) + 20 > (20 + d) \\implies 40 - d > 20 + d \\implies 20 > 2d \\implies d < 10\n     \\]\n   - \\(a + c > b\\):\n     \\[\n     (20 - d) + (20 + d) > 20 \\implies 40 > 20 \\quad \\text{(always true)}\n     \\]\n   - \\(b + c > a\\):\n     \\[\n     20 + (20 + d) > (20 - d) \\implies 40 + d > 20 - d \\implies 2d > -20 \\implies d > -10\n     \\]\n   Since \\(d\\) is non-negative for distinct, non-equilateral triangles, we actually have:\n   \\[\n   0 < d < 10\n   \\]\n5. **Finding Integer Values of \\(d\\)**: The possible integer values for \\(d\\) are \\(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\\). Each of these values gives a distinct triangle because they lead to different side lengths.\n6. **Checking Non-Equilateral Condition**: The triangles must be non-equilateral, which they will be since \\(d\\) is strictly greater than zero (ensuring \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are not all equal).\n7. **Conclusion**: The distinct integers for \\(d\\) from \\(1\\) to \\(9\\) yield distinct non-equilateral triangles. Therefore, the total number of distinct non-equilateral triangles is **9**.\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{9}\n\\]",
        "Let the sides of the triangle be denoted as \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\).

There are three sides to verify: \\( a \\), \\( 20 \\), and \\( 40 - a \\). To ensure these can form a triangle, we must satisfy the triangle inequalities:\n1. \\( a + 20 > 40 - a \\)\n2. \\( a + (40 - a) > 20 \\)\n3. \\( 20 + (40 - a) > a \\)\nLet's solve these inequalities one by one.\n1. \\( a + 20 > 40 - a \\)\n   - Rearranging gives \\( 2a > 20 \\), so \\( a > 10 \\).\n2. \\( a + (40 - a) > 20 \\)\n   - This simplifies to \\( 40 > 20 \\), which is true for all positive \\( a \\).\n3. \\( 20 + (40 - a) > a \\)\n   - Rearranging gives \\( 60 - a > a \\), leading to \\( 60 > 2a \\) or \\( a < 30 \\).\nThus, from the inequalities, we have:\n\\[\n10 < a < 30\n\\]\nSince \\( a \\) must be an integer, the possible values for \\( a \\) are \\( 11, 12, 13, \\ldots, 29 \\). We will now count these integers.\nCalculating the range:\n- The smallest integer is 11.\n- The largest integer is 29.\nTo find the number of integers in this range:\n\\[\n29 - 11 + 1 = 19\n\\]\nThus, there are 19 integers satisfying \\( 10 < a < 30 \\).\nNext, we must ensure the triangles are non-equilateral. The only case where we could have an equilateral triangle with \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) being equal occurs when \\( a = b = c \\), which is impossible here due to the arithmetic sequence unless \\( a = b = c = 20 \\). However, this is not possible because it violates \\( a + b + c = 60 \\) (it would only sum to 60 but not be non-distinct).\nThus, all these triangles will be non-equilateral.\nNow we conclude that the number of distinct, non-equilateral triangles with a perimeter of 60 units and integer side lengths that are in arithmetic sequence is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{19}\n\\]",
        "To find the distinct, non-equilateral triangles with a perimeter of 60 units and integer side lengths that form an arithmetic sequence, we start by letting the side lengths of the triangle be represented as \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\), where \\( a < b < c \\) and they can be expressed in terms of an integer \\( d \\) as follows:\n\\[\na = b - d, \\quad b = b, \\quad c = b + d\n\\]\nGiven the perimeter \\( P = a + b + c = 60 \\), we can express the perimeter in terms of \\( b \\) and \\( d \\):\n\\[\n(b - d) + b + (b + d) = 60\n\\]\nSimplifying this:\n\\[\n3b = 60 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad b = 20\n\\]\nNow substituting back to find \\( a \\) and \\( c \\):\n\\[\na = 20 - d, \\quad c = 20 + d\n\\]\nNext, we must ensure that \\( a, b, c \\) satisfy the triangle inequality:\n1. \\( a + b > c \\):\n   \\[\n   (20 - d) + 20 > (20 + d) \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 40 - d > 20 + d \\\\\n   \\Rightarrow \\quad 20 > 2d \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad d < 10\n   \\]\n2. \\( a + c > b \\):\n   \\[\n   (20 - d) + (20 + d) > 20 \\\\\n   \\Rightarrow \\quad 40 > 20 \\quad (\\text{always true})\n   \\]\n3. \\( b + c > a \\):\n   \\[\n   20 + (20 + d) > (20 - d) \\\\\n   \\Rightarrow \\quad 40 + d > 20 - d \\\\\n   \\Rightarrow \\quad 40 + 2d > 20 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 2d > -20 \\quad (\\text{always true})\n   \\]\nNow the key condition simplifying the inequalities gives us \\( d < 10 \\).
