    "problem": "Hillary has eleven coins, all dimes and nickels. In total, the coins are worth 75 cents. How many nickels does she have?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let the number of dimes Hillary has be $d$ and the number of nickels she has be $n$. We have the two equations \\begin{align*}\nd+n&=11\\\\\n10d+5n&=75\n\\end{align*} (The last equation is in terms of cents.) To make the second equation nicer, we divide both sides by 5 to get $2d+n=15$. From the first given equation, we have $d=11-n$. Substituting this into the simplified second given equation to eliminate $d$, we get $2(11-n)+n=15\\Rightarrow n=7$. Thus, Hillary has $\\boxed{7}$ nickels.",

        "Let \\( d \\) represent the number of dimes and \\( n \\) represent the number of nickels. We are given the following information:\n1. The total number of coins is 11:\n   \\[\n   d + n = 11\n   \\]\n   \n2. The total value of the coins is 75 cents. Since a dime is worth 10 cents and a nickel is worth 5 cents, we can express this as:\n   \\[\n   10d + 5n = 75\n   \\]\nNow we have a system of equations to solve:\n1. From the first equation, we can express \\( d \\) in terms of \\( n \\):\n   \\[\n   d = 11 - n\n   \\]\n2. Next, we substitute this expression for \\( d \\) into the second equation:\n   \\[\n   10(11 - n) + 5n = 75\n   \\]\n3. Expanding this gives:\n   \\[\n   110 - 10n + 5n = 75\n   \\]\n4. Combining like terms leads to:\n   \\[\n   110 - 5n = 75\n   \\]\n5. Now, we isolate \\( n \\) by subtracting 110 from both sides:\n   \\[\n   -5n = 75 - 110\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   -5n = -35\n   \\]\n6. Dividing both sides by -5 gives:\n   \\[\n   n = 7\n   \\]\nNow we can find the number of dimes by substituting \\( n \\) back into the expression for \\( d \\):\n\\[\nd = 11 - n = 11 - 7 = 4\n\\]\nSo, Hillary has:\n- \\( d = 4 \\) dimes\n- \\( n = 7 \\) nickels\nTo verify, we check the total value:\n- Value from dimes: \\( 4 \\times 10 = 40 \\) cents\n- Value from nickels: \\( 7 \\times 5 = 35 \\) cents\n- Total value: \\( 40 + 35 = 75 \\) cents\nThus, the solution checks out. Therefore, the number of nickels Hillary has is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{7}\n\\]",
        "To solve the problem, let's define the variables:\n- Let \\( d \\) be the number of dimes.\n- Let \\( n \\) be the number of nickels.\nWe know two things from the problem:\n1. The total number of coins (dimes and nickels) is 11:\n   \\[\n   d + n = 11\n   \\]\n2. The total value of the coins is 75 cents. Since dimes are worth 10 cents and nickels are worth 5 cents, we can write the value equation as:\n   \\[\n   10d + 5n = 75\n   \\]\nNow, let's simplify the second equation. We can divide everything by 5:\n\\[\n2d + n = 15\n\\]\nNow we have a system of two equations:\n1. \\( d + n = 11 \\) (Equation 1)\n2. \\( 2d + n = 15 \\) (Equation 2)\nWe can eliminate \\( n \\) by subtracting Equation 1 from Equation 2:\n\\[\n(2d + n) - (d + n) = 15 - 11\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\nd = 4\n\\]\nNow that we found \\( d = 4 \\), we can substitute it back into Equation 1 to find \\( n \\):\n\\[\n4 + n = 11\n\\]\n\\[\nn = 11 - 4 = 7\n\\]\nSo, Hillary has 4 dimes and 7 nickels.\nThus, the number of nickels Hillary has is \\(\\boxed{7}\\).",
