        " Let's define a variable for John's age and a variable for his dad's age. \nLet\u2019s call John's age \u201cj\u201d and his dad's age \u201cd\u201d.\nWe know that John is 31 years younger than his dad, so we can write the equation: d = j + 31.\nWe also know that the sum of their ages is 53 years, so we can write the equation: j + d = 53.\nTo solve for d (John's dad's age), we can substitute d = j + 31 into the second equation: j + (j + 31) = 53.\nCombining like terms, we get: 2j + 31 = 53.\nSubtracting 31 from both sides, we get: 2j = 22.\nDividing both sides by 2, we get: j = 11.\nSince John is 11 years old, we can substitute j = 11 into the first equation to solve for d: d = 11 + 31.\nSimplifying, we get: d = 42.\nTherefore, John's dad is 42 years old.\n#### 42\nThe answer is: 42",
        "\nLet $x$ be John's age and $d$ be his dad's age.\nAccording to the information, John is $31$ years younger than his dad, so we have the equation $x = d - 31$.\nThe sum of their ages is $53$ years, so we also have the equation $x + d = 53$.\nWe can solve these equations simultaneously to find the value of $d$, which represents John's dad's age.\nFirst, we can substitute the expression for $x$ from the first equation into the second equation:\n$(d - 31) + d = 53$.\nCombining like terms, we get $2d - 31 = 53$.\nAdding $31$ to both sides of the equation gives $2d = 84$.\nDividing both sides by $2$ gives $d = 42$.\nTherefore, John's dad is $\\boxed{42}$ years old.\nThe answer is: 42",
        " Let $d$ be the age of John's dad.\nThen John's age is $d - 31$.\nThe sum of their ages is $d + (d - 31) = 2d - 31$.\nWe are told that the sum of their ages is 53, so we can set up the equation $2d - 31 = 53$.\nAdding 31 to both sides of the equation, we get $2d = 84$.\nDividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get $d = 42$.\nTherefore, John's dad is $\\boxed{42}$ years old.",
        "\nLet's assume John's age is $x$ years.\nSince John is 31 years younger than his dad, his dad's age is $x + 31$ years.\nThe sum of their ages is 53 years, so we can write the equation:\n$x + (x + 31) = 53$\nCombining like terms, we have:\n$2x + 31 = 53$\nSubtracting 31 from both sides, we get:\n$2x = 22$\nDividing both sides by 2, we find:\n$x = 11$\nSo John is 11 years old.\nSubstituting this value back into the equation for his dad's age, we have:\n$x + 31 = 11 + 31 = 42$\nTherefore, John's dad is 42 years old.\nThe answer is: 42",
