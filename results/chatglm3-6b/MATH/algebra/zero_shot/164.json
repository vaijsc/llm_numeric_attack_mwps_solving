        "\nTo simplify $(5-3i)(-4+3i)$, we can use the distributive property. First, distribute $5-3i$ to each term inside the parentheses:\n$(5-3i)(-4+3i) = 5(-4) + 5(3i) - 3i(-4) - 3i(3i)$\nSimplifying each term:\n$ = -20 + 15i + 12i - 9i^2$\nNow, simplify $i^2$ to find the value of $9i^2$:\n$ = -20 + 15i + 12i - 9(-1)$\nSimplifying further:\n$ = -20 + 15i + 12i + 9$\nCombine like terms:\n$ = -11 + 27i$\nTherefore, $(5-3i)(-4+3i) = \\boxed{-11 + 27i}$.",
        "\nTo simplify an expression that involves complex numbers, we can multiply the real parts and the imaginary parts separately.\nSo, let\u2019s multiply the real parts:\n$5 \\times (-4) = -20$\nNext, let\u2019s multiply the imaginary parts:\n$-3i \\times3i = -9i^2$\nSince $i^2 = -1$:\n$-9i^2 = -9(-1) = 9$\nNow, let\u2019s put it all together:\n$(5-3i)(-4+3i) = -20 + 9i$\nTherefore, the simplified expression is $-20 + 9i$.\n#### 20\nThe answer is: 20",
        "\nFirst, we distribute the terms in the first term of the first parentheses. $5-3i\\cdot (-4+3i) = 5+12i-9i-9i^2$.\nNow let's simplify this expression.\n$5+12i-9i-9i^2 = 5-7i-9i^2$.\nNow let's simplify further.\n$5-7i-9i^2 = 5-7i-9(-1) = 5-7i+9 = 14-7i$.\nSo the expression $(5-3i)(-4+3i)$ simplifies to $\\boxed{14-7i}$.The answer is: 14-7i",
        "\n1: Distribute the terms of rational expressions: $5-3i \\cdot -4 + 5-3i \\cdot 3i$\n2: Change multiplication into addition: $5 \\cdot -4 + 5 \\cdot 3i - 3i \\cdot -4 + 3i \\cdot 3i$\n3: Simplify: $-20 + 15i + 12i + 9i^2$\n4: Since i^2 = -1, we can rewrite 9i^2 as -9\n5: Combine like terms: $-20 + 27i - 9$\n6: Simplify: $-29 + 27i$\nTherefore, the expression $(5-3i)(-4+3i)$ simplifies to $-29 + 27i$."
