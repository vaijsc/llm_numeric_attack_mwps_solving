        " \nTo find the smallest value of the expression $x^2 - 6x +13$, we can complete the square. \nA complete the square expression quadratic $ax^2 + bx + c$ can be rewritten as $(x - h)^2 + (k-h) + c$, where $(h, k)$ is the vertex of the parabola. \nFor $x^2 - 6x +13$, let's complete the square. \nThe first step in completing the square is to find $h$, the $x$-coordinate of the vertex. We can determine this by finding the coefficient of the linear term ($b$) and multiplying it by half the coefficient of the squared term ($a^2$). In this case, $b = -6$ and $a^2 = 1$, so $h = -\\frac{6}{2(1)} = -3$. \nNext, we find $k$, the $y$-coordinate of the vertex. We can determine this by substituting $h$ into the quadratic expression: $k = (h^2) - (6h) + 13 = (-3)^2 - (-6)(-3) + 13 = 9 + 18 + 13 = 31$. \nNow that we have the vertex $(h, k) = (-3, 31)$, we can rewrite the quadratic expression as $(x + 3)^2 - 31$. \nSince $-31$ is a constant term and theock value is not the same as any of the constants in the quadratic expression ($x^2$, $-6x$), we have completed the square. \nThe smallest value of the expression $x^2 - 6x +13$ occurs when $x +3$ is equal to either $-3$ or $3$, which is $-6$ and $0$, respectively. \nWhen $x + 3 = -6$, we have $x = -9$. When $x + 3 = 3$, we have $x = 0$. \nTherefore, the smallest value of the expression $x^2 - 6x + 13$ is $-9$. \nHowever, since we are given that $x$ must be an integer, the",
