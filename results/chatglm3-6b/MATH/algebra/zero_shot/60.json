        " Given a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c$, we can find thecoordinate of the minimum value by evaluating the vertex of the parabola. The x-coordinate of thevertex is given by $x = -\\frac{b}{2a}$.\nIn this case, $a = 1$ and $b = -14$. Plugging these values into the formula, \u6211\u4eec get $x = -\\frac{-14}{2(1)} = 7$. Therefore, the minimum value of $x^2 - 14x + 3$ is $7^2 - 14(7) + 3 = \\boxed{1}$.",
        " Since the coefficient of $x^2$ is positive and the coefficient of $x$ is negative, the parabola opens upwards,\u8c61\u5f81\u7740\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\u51fa\u73b0\u5728\u5b83\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u8f74\u4e0a. To determine the x-coordinate of the axis of symmetry, the value of $x$ where $-b/2a=0$ is obtained $x=\\frac{-b}{2a}=0$. This corresponds to the vertex of the parabola.  The $y$-coordinate of the vertex will be the minimum value of $x^2-14x+3$.\n### Solution: The given expression $x^2-14x+3$ can be rewritten as $(x-7)^2-4$ by factoring out an $(x-7)$ from the first two terms. Thus, the vertex of the parabola is at the point $(7,-4)$, and the minimum value of $x^2-14x+3$ is $-4$.",
        " To find the value of $x$ that gives the minimum value for the quadratic expression $x^2 - 14x + 3$, we need to find the vertex of the parabola.\nThe standard form of a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c$ is given by the equation $y = a(x - h)^2 + k$, where $(h, k)$ represents the vertex of the parabola.\nComparing this with our quadratic equation $x^2 - 14x + 3$, we can see that $a = 1$, $b = -14$, and $c = 3$.\nThe x-coordinate of the vertex can be found using the formula $h = -\\frac{b}{2a}$.\nLet's calculate $h$:\n$h = -\\frac{b}{2a}$\n$h = -\\frac{-14}{2(1)}$\n$h = \\frac{14}{2}$\n$h = 7$\nSo, the x-coordinate of the vertex is $h = 7$.\nTo find the y-coordinate of the vertex, we substitute $h$ into the standard form of the equation:\n$y = a(x - h)^2 + k$\n$y = 1(x - 7)^2 + 3$\n$y = (x - 7)^2 + 3$\nSo, the y-coordinate of the vertex is $y = (x - 7)^2 + 3$.\nTo find the value of $x$ that gives the minimum value for $x^2 - 14x + 3$, we set $y$ to its minimum value, which is 0 (since $(x - 7)^2$ is always non-negative and the minimum value for $y$ can only be 0).\nSetting $(x - 7)^2 + 3 = 0$, we can solve for $x$:\n$(x - 7)^2 + 3 = 0$\n$(x - 7)^2 = -3$\nSince $(x - 7)^2$ is non-negative, there is no real solution for $x$ that satisfies $(x - 7)^2",
        " To find the value of $x$ that gives the minimum value for $x^2 - 14x + 3$, we want to find the vertex of the parabola defined by the quadratic function.\nThe general formula for the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of a quadratic function in the form $ax^2 + bx + c$ is given by $x = -\\frac{b}{2a}$.\nIn this case, we have $a = 1$, $b = -14$, and $c = 3$.\nLet's substitute these values into the formula:\n$x = -\\frac{-14}{2(1)}$\nSimplifying the expression:\n$x = -\\frac{-14}{2}$\n$x = \\frac{14}{2}$\n$x = 7$\nThus, the value of $x$ that gives the minimum value for $x^2 - 14x + 3$ is $x = \\boxed{7}$.",
