        "\nThe heat is on! To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the minimum error in the measurement of the momentum, given that the product of the errors in momentum and position must be at least $\\frac{h}{4\\pi}$.

We can rearrange the equation to isolate $\\Delta x$:\n$\\Delta x \\geq \\frac{h}{2\\pi \\Delta p}$\nThe constant on the right-hand side is a fixed value, which means $\\Delta x$ will increase as $\\Delta p$ decreases.\nTo find the percentage increase, we divide the new minimum value of $\\Delta x$ by the original minimum value of $\\Delta x$, and multiply by 100:\n$\\frac{\\frac{h}{2\\pi \\Delta p}}{\\Delta x} \\cdot 100 = \\frac{100}{\\Delta x} \\cdot \\frac{h}{2\\pi \\Delta p} \\cdot 100 = \\frac{100h}{2\\pi \\Delta x \\Delta p} \\cdot 100$\nPlugging in $\\Delta p = \\frac{\\Delta p}{2}$, we get:\n$\\frac{100h}{2\\pi \\left(\\frac{\\Delta p}{2}\\right) \\Delta x \\Delta p} \\cdot 10",

        " To find the minimum error in the measurement of the particle's position, we need to use the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. According to the principle, the product of the error in the measurement of a particle's momentum and the error in the measurement of a particle's position must be at least Planck's constant divided by $4\\pi$. So, let's assume the error in the measurement of the momentum is halved. Let $p$ be the original momentum measurement error and $x$ be the original position measurement error. Then, the new momentum measurement error is $\\frac{p}{2}$ and the new position measurement error is $x$.\nAccording to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, $p\\cdot x \\geq \\frac{h}{4\\pi}$, where $h$ is Planck's constant.\nSince the momentum measurement error is halved, we have $p' = \\frac{p}{2}$.\nSubstituting this into the uncertainty principle, we get $\\frac{p}{2}\\cdot x \\geq \\frac{h}{4\\pi}$.\nDividing both sides by $\\frac{h}{4\\pi}$, we have $(x'\\cdot p') \\geq 1$.\nSimplifying, we find that $x' \\geq 1$.\nTherefore, the minimum error in the measurement of the particle's position increases by $100\\%$.",
        "\nSince the error in the measurement of the momentum is halved, the error in the measurement of the position is also halved, and thus the product of the error in the momentum and the error in the position is halved.
