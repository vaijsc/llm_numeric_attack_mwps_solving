So the area of the plot can be expressed as:\nArea = L * (L + 5)\nWe are given that the area of the plot should be at least 500 square feet, so we can write the inequality as:\nL * (L + 5) \u2265 500\nLet's solve this inequality step by step.\nFirst, we can expand the inequality:\nL^2 + 5L \u2265 500\nNext, we can rearrange the terms to set the inequality to 0:\nL^2 + 5L - 500 \u2265 0\nNow, we need to find the values of L that make this quadratic equation true. We can use the quadratic formula to solve it. The quadratic formula is given by:\nL = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\nFor our equation, a = 1, b = 5, and c = -500.\nPlugging in the values, we get:\nL = (-5 \u00b1 \u221a(5^2 - 4(1)(-500))) / 2(1)\nSimplifying further, we get:\nL = (-5 \u00b1 \u221a(25 + 2000)) / 2\nL = (-5 \u00b1 \u221a2025) / 2\nCalculating the square root of 2025, we get 45.\nSo, we have two possible values for L:\nL = (-5 \u00b1 45) / 2\nL = 50 / 2\nL = 25\nSince the width is given as 5 ft longer than the length, the width is:\nWidth = L + 5\nWidth = 25 + 5\nWidth = 30\nTherefore, the width of the plot is 30 ft."
