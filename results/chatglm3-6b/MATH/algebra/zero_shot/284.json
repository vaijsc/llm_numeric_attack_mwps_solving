        " We start by completing the square. To find the value of $k$, we need to look at the equation $-2x^2 + 4x + 5$. We can extract a common factor of $-2$ from both terms, giving us $-2(x^2 - 2x) + 5$. Next, we need to find the value that we need to add and subtract inside the parentheses in order to complete the square. This value is half the coefficient of $x$, which is $2$, so we add and subtract $2/2 = 1$ inside the parentheses. This gives us $-2(x^2 - 2x + 1 - 1) + 5$. Now, we can rewrite the equation as $-2((x - h)^2 - 1/2^2) + 5$. Expanding, we get $-2(x - h)^2 + 2 + 5$. Combining the constants, we have $-2(x - h)^2 + 7$.

        " To express $-2x^2 + 4x + 5$ in the form $a(x - h)^2 + k$, we need to complete the square. Completing the square means adding and subtracting the square of half the coefficient of $x$, which in this case is $-\\frac{4}{2} = -2$. So, we can rewrite $-2x^2 + 4x + 5$ as $-2\\left(x^2 - 2x\\right) + 5$.\nNext, we need to add and subtract the square of half the coefficient of $x$, which is $(-2/2)^2 = 1$. So, we can complete the square by adding and subtracting 1: $-2\\left(x^2 - 2x + 1 - 1\\right) + 5$.\nNow, let\u2019s rewrite the expression inside the parentheses: \\begin{align*}\nx^2 - 2x + 1 &= (x - 1)^2.\\hspace{10mm}\\text{(1)}\n\\end{align*} Adding and subtracting 1 to the above expression, we get $-2\\left((x - 1)^2 - 1\\right) + 5$.

To do this, we need to find the coefficient of $x$, which is -2. Dividing this coefficient by 2, we get -1. \nWe can rewrite -1 as the squared difference of a number divided by the squared average of two numbers, $(-1)^2 = 1$. The average of 1 and 0 is 0.5. \nSo the completed square expression is $x^2 - 2x + 1 - 1$.\nThis is the square of the binomial $(x - 1)^2$. \nFinally, we'll find the value that needs to be added and subtracted to get the expression in the form $a(x - h)^2 + k$. Since we added 1 and subtracted 1, the value is 1.\nTherefore, $-2x^2 + 4x + 5 = -2(x^2 - 2x + 1 - 1) + 1 = -2(x - 1)^2 + 1$.\nComparing this to the given form $a(x - h)^2 + k$, we see that $k$ is 1.\nSo the final answer is $k = \\boxed{1}$.",

Since $a$ will always be 1, let's call it 1. \nThen, the square expression will be $a(x - h)^2$ which is 1*$((x - h))^2$, or $(x - h)^2$, for brevity. \nNow we add and subtract the square of half the coefficient of $x$ inside the parentheses. That is 1*$(\\frac{-2}{2})^2$ = 1*$(-1)^2$ = 1.  \nSo, $-2x^2 + 4x + 5$ becomes $1((x - h))^2 + k$, where $k$ is equal to $-2x^2 + 4x + 5 - 1(\\text{squared term}) = -2x^2 + 4x + 4 - 1 = -2(x^2 - 2x + 2) = -2(x - 1)^2 - 2$. \nTherefore, $k = \\boxed{-2}$.",
