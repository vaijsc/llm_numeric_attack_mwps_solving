After 3 days, the number of cells is 2 \\* 2 = 4. Similarly, after another 3 days (6 days), the number of cells is 4 \\* 2 = 8, and so on.\nWe can set up an equation using this pattern:\nNumber of cells = 2 \\* 2^(3n)\nwhere n is the number of 3-day periods that have passed.\nAfter 15 days, we can substitute 15 for n in the equation and solve for the number of cells.\nNumber of cells = 2 \\* 2^(3(15/3))\n= 2 \\* 2^5\n= 2 \\* 32\n= 64\nSo, there are 64 cells at the end of the 15th day.",
        "\nAfter 3 days, each of the 2 cells splits into 2 cells, resulting in 4 cells. \nAfter another 3 days, each of the 4 cells splits into 2 cells, resulting in 8 cells. \nAfter a third 3 days, each of the 8 cells splits into 2 cells, resulting in 16 cells. \nAfter a fourth 3 days, each of the 16 cells splits into 2 cells, resulting in 32 cells. \nAfter a fifth 3 days, each of the 32 cells splits into 2 cells, resulting in 64 cells. \nAfter a sixth 3 days, each of the 64 cells splits into 2 cells, resulting in 128 cells. \nAfter a seventh 3 days, each of the 128 cells splits into 2 cells, resulting in 256 cells. \nAfter an eighth 3 days, each of the 256 cells splits into 2 cells, resulting in 512 cells. \nAfter a ninth 3 days, each of the 512 cells splits into 2 cells, resulting in 1024 cells. \nAfter a tenth 3 days, each of the 1024 cells splits into 2 cells, resulting in $\\boxed{2048}$ cells at the end of the $15^\\text{th}$ day.",
        "\n#### Theory:\nAfter the first three days, we have $2^3 = 8$ cells.\nAfter another three days, every 8 cells splits and becomes $2\\cdot8 = 16$ cells.\nAfter another three days, every 16 cells splits and becomes $2\\cdot16 = 32$ cells.\nAfter another three days, every 32 cells splits and becomes $2\\cdot32 = 64$ cells.\nAfter another three days, every 64 cells splits and becomes $2\\cdot64 = 128$ cells.\nAfter another three days, every 128 cells splits and becomes $2\\cdot128 = 256$ cells.\nAfter another three days, every 256 cells splits and becomes $2\\cdot256 = 512$ cells.\nAfter another three days, every 512 cells splits and becomes $2\\cdot512 = 1024$ cells.\nAfter this point, the number of cells doubles with each decreasing power of 2.",

        "\n#### 11-13\nLet's consider the scenario when the number of cells is 11 on the first day.\nEach cell splits and becomes two cells, resulting in 22 cells on day 3.\nAll cells split and become two cells again on day 6, resulting in $22 \\times 2 = 44$ cells on day 9.\nAll cells split and become two cells again on day 12, resulting in $44 \\times 2 = 88$ cells on day 15.\nTherefore, there are 88 cells at the end of the 15th day for this scenario.",
        " The problem is asking us to find the number of cells present at the end of $15$ days. From $t=3$ days to $t=15$ days, eachcell splits once every $3$ days, so the number of splits will be $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{15}{3} \\right\\rfloor =5.$ Each splits once to produce $2$ cells, so the total number of cells will be $2^{(5 + 1 + 3 \\cdot 15)}$.   Keep in mind that $3$ is multiplying, so $3 \\cdot 15 = 45.$   We carry on with the calculations: \\begin{align*}\n2^{(5 + 1 + 45)}&=2^{(47)} \\\\\n&=2^{4\u70ed\u7231}2^{32} \\\\\n&=[2^{4+32}]=2^{36} \\\\\n&=\\left( 2^{1} \\right)^{36} \\\\\n&=2^{1 \\cdot 36} \\\\\n&=\\boxed{65536}.\n\\end{align*}"
