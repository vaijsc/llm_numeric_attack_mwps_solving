From equations 1 and 2, we can solve for A and substitute it into equation 3 or equation 4 to find the weight of C.

Finally, Abby's weight is A and Damon's weight is D. The sum of Abby and Damon's weights, which is A + D, is 80 + D.\nSince the problem does not provide information about the value of Damon's weight, we cannot determine the exact sum of Abby and Damon's weights.
