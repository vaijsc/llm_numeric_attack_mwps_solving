So we have $\\frac{-(-12) \\pm \\sqrt{(-12)^2-4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot k}}{2 \\cdot 1}$.\nSince $m$ and $n$ are the roots, we can see that $m+n = 12$ and $mn = k$.

In this case, $q>p$.\nSince $p$ and $q$ are prime numbers, we know that $p$ and $q$ are both odd or both even. However, if $p$ is odd and $q$ is even, their sum will be odd, which is a contradiction since we know that $p+q=12$. Therefore, neither $p$ nor $q$ can be odd.\nAs a result, both $p$ and $q$ must be even. Since $12=4\\times 3$, it implies that one of them, either $p$ or $q$, is 2 and the other one is 10.\nIn this scenario, we have $p=2$ and $q=10$.\nNow we can calculate the value of $k$ using Vieta's formulas:\n$k = (p + q)^2 - 12pq$  \nPlugging in the values of $p$ and $q$, we get:\n$k = (2 + 10)^2 - 12(2)(10)$  \n$k = 12",

Now we can equate the coefficients of $x$ on both sides: $- (a+b) = -12$, which implies $a+b = 12$.\nNext, we can influence the equation and substitute $x=2$ and $x=6$. Since $a$ and $b$ are the roots of the equation, $a+b = 12$, \"2\" is a root of the equation. Therefore, $a=2$. Substituting $a=2$ into $a+b=12$, we find that $b=10$.",
