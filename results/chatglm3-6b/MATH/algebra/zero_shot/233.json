        " To write the quadratic $x^2 - 6x + 66$ in the form $(x+b)^2+c$, we need to complete the square.\nFirst, let's find the value of $b$. To find the value of $b$, we divide the coefficient of $x^2$ by the coefficient of $x$. In this case, the coefficient of $x^2$ is 1 and the coefficient of $x$ is -6, so $b = -6/1 = \\boxed{-6}$.\nNow let's find the value of $c$. To find the value of $c$, we can expand $(x+b)^2$ and find the coefficient of $x^2$. In this case, when we expand $(x+(-6))^2$, we get $x^2 + 12x - 36$. Comparing this with $x^2 - 6x + 66$, we see that the coefficient of $x^2$ is 1 and the coefficient of $x$ is 12. The constant term in $(x+b)^2$ is $b^2$, so we have $b^2 = 66 - 4(6) = 28$, which means $b = \\sqrt{28} = 2\\sqrt{7}$.\nNow, we can rewrite $x^2 - 6x + 66$ as $(x-(-6))^2 + (2\\sqrt{7})$. The value of $b+c$ is $-6 + 2\\sqrt{7}$.",
        "\nAt first, we need to rewrite the quadratic $x^2-6x+66$ in the form $(x+b)^2+c$. To do so, we complete the square. Starting with the formula $(x-h)^2=x^2-2hx+h^2$, we find that $h=-\\dfrac{b}{2}$, so the correlation  between $h$ and $h^2$ will simply be $-\\dfrac{h^2}{4h}=-\\dfrac{h^2}{4\\cdot-\\dfrac{b}{2}}=\\dfrac{-2h}{-2\\cdot \\dfrac{b}{2}}=-h$. To make life easier, we will proceed as follows $\\\u7cbe\u7075 \\\u6258\u798f 2018 descartes.$  $h^2+\\dfrac{4ac}{4}=4c-h^2$  Therefore  \\begin{align*}\nx^2-6x+66 &= (x^2-6x+\\dfrac{36}{4})+66-36 \\\\\n&= (x-\\dfrac{6}{2})^2+66-36 \\\\\n&= ((x-\\dfrac{6}{2})^2+66-36) \\\\\n&= ((x-\\dfrac{6}{2})+6)^2+66-36 \\\\\n&= ((x+3)^2-3)^2+30\\\\\n&= (x+3)^2+30.\n\\end{align*}So $b=-3$ and $c=30$, and $b+c=\\boxed{33}$.",

The coefficient of $x^2$ is 1, so we need to add and subtract $\\left(\\frac{b}{2}\\right)^2$ where $b$ is the coefficient of $x$.\nIn this case, $\\left(\\frac{b}{2}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{-6}{2}\\right)^2 = 9$.\nSo, $(x^2-6x+36+30+9)$ becomes \\[(x^2-6x+36)+30+9 = (x-3)^2+45.\\]\nThus, $b+c=3+45=\\boxed{48}$.
