        " \nLet's call the common difference \"d\". \nThe sum of an arithmetic sequence can be calculated using the formula: \\(S = \\frac{n}{2}(a + l)\\), where \\(S\\) is the sum, \\(n\\) is the number of terms, \\(a\\) is the first term, and \\(l\\) is the last term.\nWe are given that the first term \\(a\\) is 2. Let's find the sum of the third and the sixth terms using the formula \\(S = \\frac{n}{2}(a + l)\\).\nSince there are three terms in the sequence, we have \\(n = 3\\).\nThe third term is \\(a + 2d\\) and the sixth term is \\(a + 5d\\).\nWe are given that \\(a + 2d + a + 5d = 25\\).\nCombining like terms, we get \\(2a + 7d = 25\\).\nSince we know that \\(a = 2\\), we can substitute that into the equation to get \\(2(2) + 7d = 25\\).\nSimplifying, we get \\(4 + 7d = 25\\).\nSubtracting 4 from both sides, we get \\(7d = 21\\).\nDividing both sides by 7, we get \\(d = 3\\).\nNow that we have the value of \"d\", we can find the fourth term by adding it to the first term: \\(2 + 3 = 5\\).",
        " Okay, let's start by setting up the equations.\nLet's denote the common difference of the arithmetic sequence by $d$. \nThe first term would then be $2$ and the third term would be $2 + 2d$. \nThe sixth term would be $2 + 5d$ (since it's one more than the third term).\nThe given information states that the sum of the third and sixth terms is $25$.\nSo we can write the equation:\n$(2 + 2d) + (2 + 5d) = 25$\nLet's solve this equation to find the value of $d$.\nCombining like terms, we have:\n$4 + 7d = 25$\nSubtracting $4$ from both sides, we get:\n$7d = 21$\nDividing both sides by $7$, we find:\n$d = 3$\nSo we have found the common difference $d$.\nNow we can find the fourth termaring with $2$ and adding $3d$.\nThe fourth term would be $2 + 3(3) = 9$.\nTherefore, the fourth term is $\\boxed{9}$.",
        " To solve this problem, we can start by finding the common difference of the arithmetic sequence. We know that the first term is $2$, so the third term is $2 + d$, where $d$ is the common difference. Similarly, the sixth term is $2 + 5d$.\nWe are also given that the sum of the third and sixth terms is $25$. Therefore, we can set up the equation $2 + d + 2 + 5d = 25$ to find the value of $d$.\nSimplifying this equation gives us $4 + 6d = 25$. Subtracting $4$ from both sides gives us $6d = 21$. Dividing both sides by $6$ gives us $d = \\frac{21}{6} = 3\\frac{1}{2}$.\nNow that we have the common difference, we can find the fourth term. The fourth term is $2 + 3d$.

        "\nFirst, we know that an arithmetic sequence has the form $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$, where $a_n$ is the $n$th term, $a_1$ is the first term, $d$ is the common difference, and $n$ is the position of the term. In this case, we know that the first term $a_1$ is 2 and $d$ is the common difference that we need to find.\nWe are given that the sum of the third and sixth terms is 25.

Substituting these into the equation, we have:\n$(a_1 + 2d) + (a_1 + 5d) = 25$\n Combining like terms, we get:\n$2a_1 + 7d = 25$\nNow, we can use the given value of $a_1$ to solve for $d$.
