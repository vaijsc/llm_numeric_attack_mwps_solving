        "Let \\( d \\) represent the number of dimes and \\( n \\) represent the number of nickels. We are given the following information:\n1. The total number of coins is 11:\n   \\[\n   d + n = 11\n   \\]\n   \n2. The total value of the coins is 75 cents. Since a dime is worth 10 cents and a nickel is worth 5 cents, we can express this as:\n   \\[\n   10d + 5n = 75\n   \\]\nNow we have a system of equations to solve:\n1. From the first equation, we can express \\( d \\) in terms of \\( n \\):\n   \\[\n   d = 11 - n\n   \\]\n2. Next, we substitute this expression for \\( d \\) into the second equation:\n   \\[\n   10(11 - n) + 5n = 75\n   \\]\n3. Expanding this gives:\n   \\[\n   110 - 10n + 5n = 75\n   \\]\n4. Combining like terms leads to:\n   \\[\n   110 - 5n = 75\n   \\]\n5. Now, we isolate \\( n \\) by subtracting 110 from both sides:\n   \\[\n   -5n = 75 - 110\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   -5n = -35\n   \\]\n6. Dividing both sides by -5 gives:\n   \\[\n   n = 7\n   \\]\nNow we can find the number of dimes by substituting \\( n \\) back into the expression for \\( d \\):\n\\[\nd = 11 - n = 11 - 7 = 4\n\\]\nSo, Hillary has:\n- \\( d = 4 \\) dimes\n- \\( n = 7 \\) nickels\nTo verify, we check the total value:\n- Value from dimes: \\( 4 \\times 10 = 40 \\) cents\n- Value from nickels: \\( 7 \\times 5 = 35 \\) cents\n- Total value: \\( 40 + 35 = 75 \\) cents\nThus, the solution checks out.

Since dimes are worth 10 cents and nickels are worth 5 cents, we can write the value equation as:\n   \\[\n   10d + 5n = 75\n   \\]\nNow, let's simplify the second equation.

        "\nLet's place our variables: let $n$ represent the number of nickels and $d$ represent the number of dimes. We know the following:\n1. The total number of coins is 11: $n + d = 11$\n2. The total value of the coins in cents is 75: $5n + 10d = 75$\nWe want to solve for $n$, the number of nickels. Let's multiply the first equation by 5 to get rid of $d$: 5d + 5n = 55\nNow we add the two equations together by adding the left sides and the right sides separately (rather than adding the $d$ terms together):  \\begin{align*}\n5d + 5n + 5n + 10d &= 55 + 75\\\\\n15d + 10n &= 130\n\\end{align*}\nNow we divide by 5 to isolate the term with $n$: \\begin{align*}\n15d + 10n &= 130\\\\\n\\frac{15d + 10}{5} &= \\frac{130}{5}\\\\\n3d + 2n &= 26\n\\end{align*}\nFinally, we subtract $3d$ and divide by 2 from both sides to isolate $n$.  \\begin{align*}\n3d + 2n &= 26\\\\\n2n &= 26 - 3d\\\\\nn &= \\frac{26 - 3d}{2}\n\\end{align*}\nSince $n$ represents the number of nickels (a whole number), $26 - 3d$ must be divisible by 2.

        " To solve this problem, we can set up an equation. Let's use the variables n to represent the number of nickels and d to represent the number of dimes. Since there are 11 coins in total, we know that:\nn + d = 11\nThe value of the coins is given as 75 cents, which is equal to 5 nickels and 2 dimes, because 5 * 5 + 2 * 10 = 25 + 20 = 45, which is equal to 75. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n5n + 2d = 75\nTo solve for n, we can rearrange the equation:\nd = 75 - 5n\nSince we are looking for the number of nickels, we need to solve for n. To do this, we can substitute the value of d in the first equation:\nn + (75 - 5n) = 11\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n75 - 4n = 11\nSubtracting 75 from both sides, we get:\n-4n = -64\nDividing both sides by -4, we get:\nn = 16\nSo, in this case, Hillary has 16 nickels.",
        "\nLet's begin by defining some variables. Let n represent the number of nickels and d represent the number of dimes. We know that each nickel is worth 5 cents and each dime is worth 10 cents. We also know that there are 11 coins in total. The total value of all the coins is 75 cents. \nWe can write an equation based on the above information as follows:\n5n + 10d = 75\nWe also know that the number of coins, which is 11, must be represented as n + d = 11\nNow we have a system of two equations:\n1. 5n + 10d = 75\n2. n + d = 11\nSteps:\n1. Substitute d = 11 - n into the first equation and solve for n:\n5n + 10(11 - n) = 75\n5n + 110 - 10n = 75\nn = -35\nThis result is not possible since the number of coins cannot be negative. Our equations might have an error.\n2. Let's interpret this situation differently: the total amount of money Hillarity has, which is 75 cents, represents the combined value of all the coins she has. Now let's use the fact that a dime is worth 10 cents and a nickel is worth 5 cents to solve for n in the equation 5n + 10(11 - n) = 75.\n5n + 10(11 - n) = 75\n5n + 110 - 10n = 75\nn = 75 - 110\nn = -35\nAgain, this result is not possible. seems like our equations are incorrect.\nConsidering the situation, there might not be a valid solution for the number of nickels (n) given the constraints.",
