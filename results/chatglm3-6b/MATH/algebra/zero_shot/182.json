Comparing with the general form of a parabola, we have $f(x) = x^2 + 2x - 6$.\nTo find the vertex of this parabola, we need to find the value of $h$ such that $f(h) = 0$. Rearranging the equation $f(x) = x^2 + 2x - 6$, we have $f(h) = f(h)$ or $h^2 + 2h - 6 = 0$.\nThis quadratic equation can be factored as $(h - 3)(h + 2) = 0$. Solving this equation gives us $h = 3$ or $h = -2$.\nSince the vertex is the highest point of the parabola given by the equation, $h$ must be positive. Therefore, we take $h = 3$.\nTo determine the y-coordinate of the vertex, we substitute $h = 3$ into the equation $f(x) = x^2 + 2x - 6$. This gives us $f(3) = 3^2 + 2(3) - 6 = 0$, so the y-coordinate of the vertex is $3 + 6 = 9$.\nTherefore, the coordinates of the vertex are $(3, 9)$.\nNow that we know the coordinates of the vertex, we can find the distance between the vertex and the point $(4, 5)$ using the distance formula. The formula is $\\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$.\nIn this case, the coordinates of the vertex are $(3, 9)$ and the point is $(4, 5)$.

Comparing this with the general form of a quadratic equation, we have $a=1$, $b=2$, and $c=-6$. \nPlugging in the value of the coefficient of $x^2$ (i.e. $a=1$), we denote the x-coordinate of the vertex as $h$. \nUsing the formula for the x-coordinate of the vertex, $h = \\frac{-b}{2a}$, we find $h = \\frac{-2}{2} = -1$.\nThe y-coordinate of the vertex, which is also the minimum value of the graph, can be found by plugging in $h$ into the quadratic equation $y = f(h)$. \n$y = f(-1) = (-1)^2 + 2(-1) - 6 = -8$.\nTherefore, the vertex of the parabola is $(-1, -8)$.\nNow, to find the distance between the vertex $(-1, -8)$ and the point $(4,5)$, we can use the distance formula: \n$\\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2} = \\sqrt{(4-(-1))^2 + (5-(-8))^2} = \\sqrt{9 + 89} = \\sqrt{98}$.\nLet's summary the steps and final answer.\nThe distance between the vertex and the point $(4,5)$ is $\\sqrt{98}$.",
