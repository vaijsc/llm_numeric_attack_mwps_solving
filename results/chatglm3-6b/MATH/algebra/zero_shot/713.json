        "\nLet's assume the middle integer is x where x is the second number in the sequence of integers.\nLet's represent the first integer as (x-1) and the third integer as (x+1) to form a set of equations:\n(x-1) + x + (x+1) = 27\nCombining like terms, we get:\n3x = 27\nDividing both sides by 3, we get:\nx = 9\nSo the middle integer is 9.\nNow we have the three consecutive integers as: 8, 9, and 10.\nTo find the product of these integers, we multiply them together:\n8 * 9 * 10 = 720\nSo the product of the integers is 720.",
        " \n#### Step 1:\nLet's assume the first number is x. Since the three integers are consecutive, the second number would be x + 1. \nThe sum of the three numbers is x + (x + 1) + (x + 2) = 3x + 3. \nGiven that the sum of the three integers is 27, we have the equation: \n3x + 3 = 27.\n### Step 2:\nTo solve for x, we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation: \n3x + 3 - 3 = 27 - 3.\nThis simplifies to: \n3x = 24.\nFinally, we divide both sides of the equation by 3 to find x: \nx = 8.\nSo, the three consecutive integers are 8, 9, and 10.\n#### Step 3:\nTo find the product of the integers, we multiply all three numbers together: \n8 * 9 * 10 = 720.\nTherefore, the product of the three consecutive integers is 720.\n#### final answer:\nThe product of the three consecutive integers is 720.",
        " Let's represent the middle integer as \"x\". \nThe three consecutive integers are: x, x+1, and x+2.\nAccording to the problem, the sum of these integers is 27.\nSo, we can write this as an equation:\nx + (x + 1) + (x + 2) = 27\nCombining like terms, we get:\n3x + 3 = 27\nNow, let's solve for x:\n3x = 24\nx = 8\nTherefore, the middle integer is 8.\nThe three consecutive integers are: 8, 9, and 10.\nNow, let's calculate the product of these integers:\n8 * 9 * 10 = 720\nSo, the product of the integers is 720.",
