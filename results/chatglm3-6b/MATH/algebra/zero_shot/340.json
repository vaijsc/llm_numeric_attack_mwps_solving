        " Let's use Plugging In:\nIf we plug in $x = 2$ into the equation $h(x) = (x^2-7x+10) \\cdot g(x)$, we can check if two known $x$ values will give the same polynomial: If the coefficient of $x$ is equal for both values, then plugging them in will yield the same result. This rules out the possibility of having $g(x) = (x-2)(x- a)$ where $a \\neq 2$, then that would make coefficients of $x$ different. This establishes that $g(x)$ is irreducible when plugged into $h(x) = (x^2-7x+10)$.\nWe must now look at the polynomial that results when $g(x)$ is multiplied out, the coefficients that appear in the result must have a $x$ term and they must all increment and decrease by $1$ while decreasing by a factor of $2$. It can be seen that the degree of a polynomial that has coefficients going from $1$ to $2$ in increasing order is $5$. To satisfy the conditions of the\u81ea\u52a9enoemmath, that state each coefficient values must be a set of numbers equal multiple of the coefficient of $x$ and quadratic in it, it must be the case that the degree of $g(x)$ is $5$.\nTherefore, $b = \\boxed{5}$.",

We know that $h(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 5, and $h(x) = (x^2-7x+10) \\cdot g(x)$.\nSince $h(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 5, the highest power of $x$ in $h(x)$ is $x^5$. The highest power of $x$ in $g(x)$ is a lower degree than the highest power of $x$ in $h(x)$, which means $g(x)$ must have at least degree 5.\nNow let's compare the degrees of the two polynomials:\n- The highest power of $x$ in $h(x)$ is $x^5$, which is obtained from the product of the highest power of $x$ in $g(x)$ ($x^5$) and the lowest power of $x$ in $h(x)$ ($1$),\u4ee5\u4e60\u8fd1\u5e73\u540c\u5fd7\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u7684\u515a\u4e2d\u592e\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u8ba9\u90a3\u90e8\u961fns{}We can Fish \uff0c just like in the old days \uff0c catching Zeroes.

        " \nFirst, we understand that $h(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $5$. Since $(x^2-7x+10) \\cdot g(x)$ results in $h(x)$, the degree of the polynomial on the right side is $2+b$ (because the degree of a product of two polynomials is the sum of their degrees). Therefore, $2+b=5$.\nFrom the equation we have $2+b=5$. Subtracting $2$ from both sides gives $b=3$.\nLet's put the solution in $\\boxed{}$:\n```\n[solution]\nThe degree of $h(x)$ is $5$, and the degree of $(x^2-7x+10)$ is $2$. Therefore, the degree of $g(x)$ must be $3$ in order for $h(x)$ to have a degree of $5$.\nSo, the value of $b$ is $\\boxed{3}$.\n```",
        " \nLet\u2019s consider the degree of $x^2-7x+10$. A polynomial $p(x)$ has $k$ terms, where the highest order term is $x^k$.  So this polynomial has degree 2. Then the degree of $g(x)$ mustbe $5$, because we multiplied a polynomial of degree 2 by $g(x)$, and the result must have a term of degree 5 in its expansion, to\u56e0\u4e3a\u8fd9\u5f88\u53ef\u80fd\u610f\u5473\u7740\u5728\u7ed3\u5408 our multiplication\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u6240\u6709\u9879\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u5fc5\u987b\u6709 $5$ \u4e2a\u524d\u9762\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u3002 This means that $b=2$.\nSolution:\nWe need to find the degree $b$ of $g(x)$, which is the degree of the polynomial $h(x)$.\nWe know that $h(x) = (x^2-7x+10) \\cdot g(x)$.\nTo determine the degree of $g(x)$, we need to look at the highest power of $x$ in the expression $(x^2-7x+10) \\cdot g(x)$.\nThe highest power of $x$ in $x^2-7x+10$ is $x^2$, and the highest power of $x$ in $g(x)$ is not specified.\nWhen we multiply $x^2$ by $g(x)$, the highest power of $x$ that appears is $x^2$, and all the previous powers of $x$ assumed to be present in $g(x)$.\nTherefore, the degree of $h(x)$ is $5$ (since this is the degree of $x^2-7x+10$).\nSince we multiplied a polynomial of degree $2$ by $g(x)$ to get $h(x)$, $g(x)$ must have degree $5$ as well.\nTherefore, the degree of $g(x)$ is $\\boxed{5}$.The answer is: 5",
        " We have that $h$ is of degree 5 and $h(x) = (x^2-7x+10) \\cdot g(x)$. By the Product of Polynomials Theorem, the highest degree term of $h(x)$ is $(x^2-7x+10) \\cdot g(x)$, which is of degree $\\max(2,b)$. Since the degree of $h$ is 5, we have \\[\n\\max(2,b) = 5.\n\\] Solving this inequality gives $b=\\boxed{3}$.\nThe answer is: 3",
        " \n- Since $h(x) = (x^2-7x+10) \\cdot g(x)$, we can see that the degree of $h(x)$ is $2+b$. \n- We are given that the degree of $h(x)$ is $5$, so we have $2+b=5$. \n- Subtracting $2$ from both sides of the equation, we get $b=3$. \n- Therefore, $b=\\boxed{3}$."
