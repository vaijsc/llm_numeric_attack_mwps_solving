        " \nFirst, simplify the exponent: $8^4 = (2^3)^4 = 8^3$\nThen, simplify the expression: $\\sqrt[12]{8^3} = \\sqrt[12]{(2^3)^3} = \\sqrt[12]{2^9} = \\sqrt[12]{2^{9 \\cdot 1}} = \\sqrt[12]{2^9} \\cdot \\sqrt[12]{2^{-9}}$\nUsing the properties of exponents, we can combine the radicals:\n$\\sqrt[12]{2^9} \\cdot \\sqrt[12]{2^{-9}} = \\sqrt[12]{2^{9 + (-9)}} = \\sqrt[12]{2^0} = \\sqrt[12]{1} = \\boxed{1}$\nThe answer is: 1",
        " \nWe can start by simplifying the expression inside the \u00a0sqrt \u00a0 ceiling:\n$\\sqrt[12]{8^4}$\nNotice that $8^4 = (2^3)^4 = 2^{3*4} = 2^{12}$\nSo the expression inside the \u00a0sqrt \u00a0 ceiling becomes:\n$\\sqrt[12]{2^{12}}$\nNow let's simplify the expression further. Recall that:\n$\\sqrt[n]{a^m} = a^{\\frac{m}{n}}$\nSo we have:\n$\\sqrt[12]{2^{12}} = 2^{\\frac{12}{12}} = 2^1$\nFinally, we can simplify $2^1$ to simply $\\boxed{2}$."
