        "\nTo solve this problem, we can set up a proportion using similar triangles.\nWe know that Monica's shadow is 2 feet long and the pine tree's shadow is 34 feet long. Let's let \"h\" represent the height of the pine tree.\nWe can set up the proportion as follows:\nMonica's height / Monica's shadow length = Pine tree's height / Pine tree's shadow length\n5 / 2 = h / 34\nNow, let's cross-multiply and solve for h:\n5 * 34 = 2 * h\n170 = 2h\nDivide both sides of the equation by 2:\nh = 170 / 2\nh = 85\nTherefore, the height of the pine tree is 85 feet.\n#### 85\nThe answer is: 85",
        " To solve this problem, we can set up a proportion. \nLet's say the height of the pine tree is x feet. \nAccording to the given data, we have:\nMonica's height / Monica's shadow length = Pine tree height / Pine tree's shadow length \n5 / 2 = x / 34 \nTo solve for x, we can cross multiply:\n5 * 34 = 2 * x \n170 = 2x \nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\nx = 85 \nTherefore, the height of the pine tree is 85 feet. \n#### 85\nThe answer is: 85"
