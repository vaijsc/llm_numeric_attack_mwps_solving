Finally, $$a+b = \\boxed{2}.$$",
        "\nTo find the value of $a+b,$ we need to consider two cases:\nCase 1: The second geometric series has the same common ratio as the first series.\nIn this case, the sum of the second series is $\\frac{1}{S},$ so we have\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{b}{1-b} &= \\frac{1}{1+b}, \\\\\nb^2+b-1 &= 0.\n\\end{align*}Solving this quadratic equation, we find $b = \\frac{-1\\pm\\sqrt{5}}{2}.$ Since we're given that $b$ is positive, we have $b = \\frac{-1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}.$ Then $a+b=\\frac{-1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}+\\frac{-1-\\sqrt{5}}{2}=\\boxed{-1}.$\nCase 2: The second geometric series has a different common ratio.\nIn this case, the decay of the second series is $\\frac{1}{S},$ so we have\n\\[\\frac{a}{1-a^2}\\]and the real part of the answer will be $\\frac{-1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}$. Thus, we find the magnitude of the complex number $\\frac{-1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}.$ The magnitude of $\\frac{-1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}$ is $\\boxed{1}.$\nAlternatively, or actually more simply, we could have worked this problem\u51e0\u4f55\u5730.\nNote that the two geometric series added together $\\frac{a}{1-a^2}$ + $\\frac{1}{S}$ (\u5bf9\u4e0d\u8d77\uff0c\u4f3c\u4e4e\u6211\u7684\u56de\u590d\u5728\u8fd9\u91cc\u51fa\u73b0\u4e86\u6253\u5370\u9519\u8bef)\u3002 Multiplying both sides by\n$(1- a^2)$ gives us $a + 1\\cdot \\frac{1}{1- a^2} = \\frac{-1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}.$ At first, we see that $\\frac{a}{1-a^2}$ is greater than $\\frac{1}{1- a^2}$ for $0 < a < 1.$ Then 2 (my apologies again) has the advantage that $\\frac{a}{1-a^2} + (a + 1) = 1.$ We also know that $a\\cdot b = \\frac{a}{1-a^",
        " Let\u2019s break down the problem and think about how to approach it.\n#### Problem Breakdown:\n- Determine the given series for the first geometric series.\nThe first geometric series has a leading term of $a$, a common ratio of $b$, and a sum of $S$. The formula to find the sum of an infinite geometric series is given by: $S = \\frac{a}{1-r}$, where $a$ is the first term and $r$ is the common ratio. "
