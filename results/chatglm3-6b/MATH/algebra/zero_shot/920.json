        " To find the number of ligs equivalent to 80 lugs, we need to first determine the ratio of ligs to lags and then use that ratio to find the number of ligs.\nWe know that 7 ligs = 4 lags, so the ratio of ligs to lags is 7/4.\nTo find the number of ligs equivalent to 80 lugs, we can multiply the ratio of ligs to lags by the number of lugs:\n7/4 \\* 80 = 175.\nTherefore, 175 ligs are equivalent to 80 lugs.",
        " \nFirst, we need to find the equivalence of 1 lag to ligs. Since 9 lags = 20 lugs, then 1 lag = 20/9 lugs. \nNext, we need to find the equivalence of 1 lag to ligs. Since 7 ligs = 4 lags, then 1 ligation = 4/7 lags. \nTo find the equivalence of 80 lugs to ligs, we can CROSS Multiply: 80 lugs * (1 lag/20 lugs) * (1 ligation/(4 lags)) = 80 * 1/20 * 1/4 = 80/80 = <<80/80=1>>1. Answer: \\boxed{1}.",
        " First, we need to find the number of ligs per lag.\nWe can do this by dividing the given equation where 7 ligs are equivalent to 4 lags:\n7 ligs / 4 lags = 1.75 ligs / lag\nNext, we need to find the number of ligs per lug.\nWe can do this by dividing the given equation where 9 lags are equivalent to 20 lugs:\n9 lags / 20 lugs = 0.45 lags / lug\nCombining these two equations, we can find the number of ligs per lug by multiplying the two expressions:\n0.45 lags / lug * 1.75 ligs / lag = 0.7125 ligs / lug\nNow, we need to find out how many ligs are equivalent to 80 lugs. To do this, we divide 80 lugs by the number of ligs per lug (0.7125 ligs/l\u5955):\n80 lugs / 0.7125 ligs/l\u5955 = 113.085 ligs\nTherefore, 80 lugs are equivalent to approximately 113 ligs.",
        "\nTo find the number of ligs equivalent to 80 lugs, we need to establish the conversion factor between ligs and lugs. We know that 7 ligs are equivalent to 4 lags and 9 lags are equivalent to 20 lugs.\nTherefore, 1 lag can be equivalent to 4/7 ligs or 20/9 lugs.\nTo find the equivalent of 80 lugs, we can multiply 80 by the conversion factor of 1 lag = 4/7 ligs.\nThis gives us 80 \u00d7 (4/7) = 32.857 ligs.\nHowever, since we cannot have a fraction of a lig, we round down to the nearest whole number, so 80 ligs are equivalent to 80 ligs.\nTherefore, 80 ligs are equivalent to 80 ligs.",
        " To solve this problem, we can set up a proportion. \nWe have the following equations:\n7 ligs = 4 lags\n9 lags = 20 lugs\nTo find the number of ligs equivalent to 80 lugs, we can set up the proportion:\n(number of ligs) / (number of lags) = (number of ligs) / (number of lugs)\nSubstituting the given values into the proportion, we get:\n(number of ligs) / 4 = 80 / 20\nTo solve for the number of ligs, we can cross multiply:\n(number of ligs) * 20 = 4 * 80\nSimplifying, we have:\n(number of ligs) * 20 = 320\nDividing both sides by 20, we find:\n(number of ligs) = 16\nTherefore, there are 16 ligs equivalent to 80 lugs.",
        " To solve this problem, we first need to find the ratio of ligs to lags and then use that ratio to find how many ligs are equivalent to a certain number of lugs.\nThe given information tells us that 7 ligs = 4 lags and 9 lags = 20 lugs.\nFirst, we find the ratio of ligs to lags by dividing the first equation by the second equation:\n$\\frac{7\\text{ ligs}}{4\\text{ lags}} = \\frac{7}{4}\\\u5de6\u53f3\u56ed\u533a\nNext, we use this ratio to find how many ligs are equivalent to 80 lugs by dividing the number of ligs by the conversion factor $\\frac{7}{4}$:\n$\\frac{7\\text{ ligs}}{4\\text{ lags}} = \\frac{7}{4}\\\u5de6\u53f3\u56ed\u533a\n80\\text{ lugs} \\div \\frac{7}{4} = 80\\text{ ligs}\\div \\frac{7}{4} \\times \\frac{4}{7}\\\u52c7\u5f80\u76f4\u524d\n$\\frac{80\\text{ ligs}}{7} = 80\\text{ ligs}\\div \\frac{7}{4} \\times \\frac{4}{7}$\nMultiplying both sides by $\\frac{4}{7}$, we get:\n$\\frac{80\\text{ ligs}}{7} \\times \\frac{4}{7} = 80\\text{ ligs} \\times \\frac{4}{7}$\n$40\\text{ ligs} = 80\\text{ ligs} \\times \\frac{4}{7}$\nDividing both sides by 80 and multiplying by 7, we get:\n$7\\text{ ligs} = 40\\text{ ligs} \\times \\frac{7}{4}$\n\u8ba1\u7b97\u51fa\u7ed3\u679c\u662f$7\\text{ ligs} = 110\\text{ ligs}$.\nSo, 80 lugs on planet Larky is equivalent to 110 ligs.",
