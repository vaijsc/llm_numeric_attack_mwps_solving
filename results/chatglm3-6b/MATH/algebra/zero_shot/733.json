        " To find the price at which the store maximizes its revenue, we need to find the maximum value of the expression $R(p) = p(120-3p)$. \nTo begin, we can find where the expression is positive. Recall that multiplying a negative number and a positive number results in a negative number, so the expression $p(120-3p)$ is positive when $p(120-3p) > 0$.\n$$p(120-3p) > 0$$\nExpanding, we have $120p - 3p^2 > 0$.\nRearranging, we get $3p^2 - 120p > 0$.\nDividing both sides by 3, we have $p^2 - 40p > 0$.\nFactoring out $p$, we obtain $p(p-40) > 0$.\nTherefore, the expression $p(120-3p)$ is positive when $p > 40$ or $p < 0$. However, since $p$ represents a price (which cannot be negative), we do not need to consider the interval $p < 0$.\nWith this information, we can now analyze the quadratic formula of $p(120-3p)$: $p = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$.\nIn the equation $p(120-3p) = 0$, we have $p(-3) \\pm \\sqrt{(-3)^2-4(1)(120)} = 0$.\nSimplifying, we get $p(3) \\pm \\sqrt{9-560} = 0$.\nHence, we have $p = \\frac{-(-3) \\pm \\sqrt{-561}}{2(-3)}$.\nSimplifying further, we get $p = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{-561}}{-6}$.\nSince the discriminant $b^2-4ac$ is negative, the quadratic formula gives us complex solutions for $p$, which means it is not possible to find a real price that maximizes the revenue.\nThus, we cannot determine a maximum price in this case.",

        " Answer: To maximize revenue, we need to multiply the price of each book by the number of books sold it.\u5728\u6211\u56fd, multiplying the number of books sold by the price can be understood as multiplying the quantity of a certain good (the number of books sold) by its price (the price per book). We can multiply these quantities to find the revenue.\nThe revenue $R$ is given by:\n$R = p \\cdot (120 - 3p)$\nTo find the price that maximizes the revenue, we need to take the derivative of the revenue with respect to the price and set it equal to zero. This will give us the critical points of the revenue function, which we can test to determine the maximum revenue.\n$R'(p) = (120 - 3p) - 3 = 0$\nSolving for $p$, we find:\n$120 - 3p = 3$\n$3p = 117$\n$p = \\frac{117}{3}$\nHowever, since $p \\leq 40$, the value of $p$ we found is not valid. We should select the price that is closest to $\\frac{117}{3}$ within the given range of prices.\nThe closest value within the range $1 \\leq p \\leq 40$ is $p = 40$.\nTherefore, the store should charge $\\boxed{40}$ dollars for the book to maximize its revenue.",
        " The revenue is calculated as the product of the number of books sold and the price of each book. So the revenue can be represented as $R = p(120-3p)$. Expanding, we get $R = 120p - 3p^2$. To find the price that maximizes the revenue, we need to complete the square. Completing the square involves reflecting about the $y$-axis the graph of $y = -3x^2 + 120x$. The point of maximumness occurs where the graph reflects over this point so that the new vertex is the pint where maximum revenue occurs. \nFirst, we rewrite the equation as $R = -3(p^2 - 40p) = -3(p^2 - 40p + 400 - 400) = -3((p - 20)^2 - 400)$. Simplifying, we have $R = -3(p - 20)^2 + 400$.\nSince the coefficient of the $(p - 20)^2$ term is negative, the parabola opens downward. This means that the vertex will be the highest point on the curve. The $p$-coordinate of the vertex is given by $p = 20$, and the maximum revenue occurs at this price.\nSubstituting $p = 20$ into the revenue formula $R = -3(p - 20)^2 + 400$, we get $R = -3(20 - 20)^2 + 400 = 400$.\nTherefore, the store should charge $\\boxed{400}$ dollars for the book to maximize its revenue.",
        " To solve this problem, we need to find the price $p$ such that the revenue is maximized. The revenue is given by the product of the number of books sold and the price per book. So, our goal is to maximize the product $(120-3p)(p)$.\nFirst, let's expand this product:\n$(120-3p)(p) = 120p - 3p^2$.\nNow, we need to differentiate this expression with respect to $p$ to find the value of $p$ that maximizes the revenue. To do this, we set the derivative equal to 0 and solve for $p$:\n$\\frac{d}{dp}(120p - 3p^2) = 120 - 6p$.\nSetting this equal to 0, we have $120 - 6p = 0$. Solving for $p$, we find $p = 20$.\nHowever, we need to check if this value of $p$ gives a maximum or a minimum. Since the coefficient of $p^2$ is negative, this means that the vertex of the quadratic function is a minimum.\nTherefore, the price the store should charge to maximize its revenue is $p = \\boxed{20}$ dollars.",

The critical points are the values of p for which the derivative of the function is equal to zero.\nFirst, let's find the derivative of the revenue function with respect to p:\ndRevenue/dp = (120 - 3p)/p = 120/p - 3\nNext, we set the derivative equal to zero and solve for p:\n120/p - 3 = 0\nNow, we solve for p:\np = 120/3\np = 40\nSo, the critical point is p = 40.\nSince the price must be less than or equal to 40, the store should charge a price of 40 dollars to maximize its revenue.",
        " To solve this problem, let's create a quadratic equation for the total revenue using the given variables. The revenue is given by the product of the number of books sold (or the \"price\" $p$) and the price per book.\nRearranging for $p$, we have $p = \\frac{120 - 3p}{3}$. So $4p = 120$ and $p = 30$.\nTo check that this is the maximum, take the derivative of the revenue with respect to $p$ by differentiating the quadratic in $p$.\nPutting everything together, the price to maximize the revenue is $\\boxed{30}$ dollars.",
        " To maximize its revenue, the bookstore should charge a price that will give it the highest possible profit. In this case, we need to find the profit that the store makes. The formula for profit is given by $Profit = Revenue - Cost$. The store's revenue is calculated by multipllying the number of books sold by the book's price. The cost is calculated by multiplying the number of books sold by the cost per book.\nLet $R$ represent the revenue and $C$ represent the cost. The revenue $R$ is calculated as $R = (120 - 3p)(p)$. The cost $C$ is calculated as $C = (120 - 3p)(p \\cdot 2)$.\nTherefore, the profit $P$ is calculated as $P = R - C$. We are given that $p \\le 40$, so we can plug in different values of $p$ to find the price that maximizes the profit.\nLet's calculate.\nWhen $p = 0$, the number of books sold per month is 120, and the cost per book is 2 dollars. The revenue is 0, and the cost is $0 \\cdot 2 = 0$. Therefore, the profit is also 0.\nWhen $p = 10$, the number of books sold per month is 90, and the cost per book is 2 dollars. The revenue is $90 \\cdot 10 = 900$, and the cost is $90 \\cdot 2 = 180$. Therefore, the profit is $900 - 180 = 720$.\nWhen $p = 20$, the number of books sold per month is 60, and the cost per book is 2 dollars. The revenue is $60 \\cdot 20 = 1200$, and the cost is $60 \\cdot 2 = 120$. Therefore, the profit is $1200 - 120 = 1080$.\nWhen $p = 30$, the number of books sold per month is 30, and the cost per book is 2 dollars. The revenue is $30 \\cdot 30 = 900$, and the cost is $30 \\cdot 2",
        " To find the price that maximizes the revenue, we need to find the price that maximizes the product of the number of books sold and the price of each book. This is\u5219\u5728 the equation for revenue $R$:\n$R = p(120-3p) = 120p - 3p^2$\nTo find this maximum, we can rewrite the equation as $R = -3(p^2 - 40p) + 120p$. We see that $R$ is maximized when $p = \\frac{-b}{2a} = \\frac{-(-40)}{2(-3)} = 20$. Since $p \\leq 40$, the store should charge $\\boxed{20}$ dollars for the book to maximize its revenue.\n[The answer is: 20)",
        " The revenue is the product of the price and the number of books sold. Therefore, we have the formula:\nRevenue = p (120 - 3p)\nTo maximize revenue, we need to find the price that maximizes the product. This occurs at the vertex of the parabola.\nTo find the x-coordinate (or price) of the vertex, we use the formula x = -b / (2a), where a and b are the coefficients of the quadratic equation.\nIn this case, a = 3 and b = -120.\nFinally, we substitute the values into the formula to find the price that maximizes the revenue:\nx = -(-120) / (2 * 3) = 120 / 6 = 20\nSo, the store should charge \u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6700\u5927\u503c\u4e3a \\boxed{20}$ dollars.",

        " To solve this, we need to set up an expression for the total revenue and then take the derivative of that expression to find the price that maximizes the revenue. The total revenue is the product of the number of books sold and the price of each book. So, our expression for total revenue is: $(120-3p)(p)$. We can then take the derivative of this expression with respect to $p$ and set it equal to 0 to find the price that maximizes the revenue.\nTo find the derivative, we can use the chain rule. We have:\n$$\\frac{d}{dp}((120-3p)(p)) = \\frac{120p - 3p^2}{p^2} = 120 - 6p$$\nSetting this equal to 0, we have:\n$$120 - 6p = 0$$\nSolving for $p$, we find:\n$$p = 20$$\nSo, the store should charge $\\boxed{20}$ dollars for the book to maximize its revenue.",
        " Ultimately, we want to find the price $p$ such that the revenue is maximized. The revenue is given by the product of the number of books sold and the price of the book. We have: \\begin{align*}\n\\text{Revenue} &= (120-3p)(p) \\\\\n&= 120p - 3p^2.\n\\end{align*}To find the price $p$ that maximizes the revenue, we can take the derivative of the revenue with respect to $p$ and set it equal to zero.

Thus, we have the solution $p = \\boxed{10}$.",
        " To find the price that maximizes revenue, we first need to find the equation for revenue.\nRevenue is equal to the price of the book multiplied by the number of books sold.\nSo the equation for revenue is R = p(120 - 3p).\nExpanding the product gives R = 120p - 3p^2.\nTo find the value of p that maximizes the revenue, we can take the derivative of the revenue function with respect to p, set it equal to 0, and solve for p.\nRening the derivative gives -6p + 120 = 0.\nDividing both sides by -6 gives p = 20.\nTherefore, the store should charge $p = \\boxed{20}$ dollars to maximize its revenue.The answer is: 20",
        " The revenue is given by the product of the price and the number of books sold, so the revenue function is $R(p) = p(120-3p)$.9cents. To maximize revenue, we need to find the value of $p$ that maximizes this expression.\nWe can start by expanding the expression to get $R(p) = 120p - 3p^2$.\nTo find the vertex of the parabola, we can take the derivative of this expression and set it equal to zero: $$\\frac{dR}{dp} = 120 - 6p = 0.$$Solving for $p$, we find $p = 20$.\nWe can then check the value of the quadratic expression at $p = 20$ to see if it gives us a maximum. Since the coefficient of $p^2$ is negative, the graph of the parabola opens downward, so the maximum value occurs at the vertex. Substituting $p = 20$ into the expression for $R(p)$, we find that the revenue is $R(20) = 20(120 - 3(20)) = 20(120 - 60) = 20(60) = \\boxed{1200}$.The answer is: 1200",
