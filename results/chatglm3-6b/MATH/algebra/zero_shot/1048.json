In the first case, we have $d = 3^2 - x$. In the second case, we have $d = 3^4 - 3^2$. We can simplify both cases by recognizing that these expressions are equal to $(3^2 + 3 \\cdot d)(3^2 - 3 \\cdot d) = (9 - x)(9 - x) = x^2 - 18x + 81$. We need the differences to be equal, so in the first case we have $9 - x = x^2 - 18x + 81$.\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6839\u636e\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u89e3\u7b54\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5df2\u7ecf\u77e5\u9053\u4e24\u4e2a\u76f8\u90bb\u7684\u9879\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u7eb2\u662f3\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c$d = 3^2$ \u6216 $d = 3^4 - 3^2$\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u662f\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u53ea\u9700\u8981\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u6765\u89e3\u65b9\u7a0b\u3002\u8bf7\u6ce8\u610f\uff0c\u5bf9\u96cc\u6027\u7684\u533a\u5206\u662f\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u3002\u5728\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e8e\u96c4\u6027\u7684\u533a\u5206\u5c31\u4e0d\u90a3\u4e48){4}\u3002\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u793e\u4f1a\u4e2d\uff0c\u5bf9\u5973\u6027\u7684\u533a\u5206\u5df2\u7ecf\u4e0d\u5982\u5bf9\u7537\u6027\u7684\u533a\u5206\u90a3\u4e48\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u8bb8\u591a\u793e\u4f1a\u548c\u5236\u5ea6\u90fd\u5728\u52aa\u529b\u6d88\u9664\u6027\u522b\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6027\u522b\u5e73\u7b49\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u4fee\u6539\u6cd5\u5f8b\u526f\u4f5c\u7528\u3001\u63d0\u4f9b modify \u751f\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u63d0\u4f9b streamlined \u536b\u751f\u4fdd\u5065\u7b49\u3002 divide the population and to distribution of wealth and opportunities.
