        "\nTo begin, let's compare the two quadratics $16x^2 + 36x + 56$ and $(mx+n)^2$. The constant terms for both quadratics are 56, so we know that $(mx+n)^2$ must also be equal to 56 for this to be true. The only way to express a quadratic in the form $(ax+b)^2$ is to expand it. Expanding $(mx+n)^2$ yields $m^2x^2 + 2mnx + n^2$. \nComparing this expression to $16x^2 + 36x + 56$, we can see that the coefficients of $x^2$, $x$, and the constant term are equal. \nWe are given the conditions: \n1. $(mx+n)^2 = 16x^2 + 36x + 56$. \n2. The constant terms are equal, which means $n^2 = 56$. \nSince $n^2 = 56$, taking the square root of both sides, we have $n = \\pm \\sqrt{56}$. \nSince $m$ and $n$ are given to be positive, we discard $-\\sqrt{56}$. Thus, $n = \\sqrt{56}$. \nFinally, we are asked to find $mn$. \nWe know that $m$ and $n$ differ only in their constant term, as stated in the problem, so $m = n\\sqrt{56}/\\sqrt{56} = n$. Therefore, $mn = n^2 = (\\sqrt{56})^2 = 56$.\nThe answer is: 56",

        " \nWe are given that $16x^2+36x+56$ and $(mx+n)^2$ differ only in their constant term. And we are asked to find $mn$.\nInstead of finding $mn$ directly, let's first find $(mx+n)^2$, this will help us determine the value of the constant term.\nExpanding $(mx+n)^2$, we get:\n$$(mx+n)^2=m^2x^2+2mnx+n^2$$\nWe are told that the difference between these two quadratics is only the constant term. Thus, \n$$m^2x^2+2mnx+n^2-[16x^2+36x+56]=56$$\n$$m^2x^2+2mnx+n^2-16x^2-36x-56=56$$\n$$m^2x^2-16x^2+2mnx+n^2=36x+56$$\n$$m^2x^2-16x^2+2mnx=36x+56-n^2$$\n$$x^2(m^2-16)+2mnx=36x+56-n^2$$\nSince the given quadratic equations differ only in their constant terms, the coefficients of the $x^2$ coefficient and the constant term on the left side of the equation must be equal to the coefficients of the $x^2$ coefficient and the constant term on the right side of the equation. Hence, we can equate the coefficients of the $x^2$ term and the constant term to get a system of equations:\n$$m^2-16=16$$\n$$2mn=36$$\n$$56=n^2$$\nSolving this system of equations gives us:\n$$m^2=32$$\n$$n^2=56$$\n$$m=4, \\ \\ n=8 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad m=-4, \\ \\ n=-8$$\nSince we are looking for values between 0 and 16 for $m$, the only valid solution is $(m,n)=(4,8)$. Therefore,",
        " 1. Strategy: We can start by looking at the expression of $(mx+n)^2$. Applying the identity $(a+b)^2=a^2+2ab+b^2$, we have $(mx+n)^2=m^2(x^2+2nx+n^2)$. Since $16x^2+36x+56$ and $(mx+n)^2$ differ only by their constant term, it follows that $56=(m^2)(n^2+2nx)$. Since the coefficient of $x^2$ is the same in both expressions, we can eliminate the $2nx$ term to get $56=m^2n^2$. Dividing both sides by $m^2$, we find that $n^2=56/m^2$. Since $n$ is positive, $m$ must be positive to ensure positive terms. Thus, let's consider the possible divisors of 56: 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 14, 28, and 56. We can quickly eliminate 1 and 8, since they would result in $n^2$ being 1 or 2, which are not positive. \n### Solution: There are no possible positive divisors of 56 that satisfy the condition $56/m^2=n^2$, so there are no solutions in the form of $(m,n)$ that work. Therefore, there is no valid solution to the request for $m$ and $n$, and we cannot determine $mn$.",

By comparing the constant terms, we can see that if $16x^2 + 36x + 56$ and $(mx + n)^2$ differ only in their constant term, then $16x^2 + 36x + 56$ is equal to $(mx + n)^2$.\nSetting the constant terms equal to each other, we have $16x^2 + 36x + 56 = m^2x^2 + 2mnx + n^2$.\nComparing like terms, we get \\[16(x^2 + 2x + \\tfrac{25}{4}) = m^2x^2 + 2mnx + n^2.\\]\nSince the constant term is $56$, we have $\\tfrac{25}{4} \\times 16 = 56$.

So, $m = 4$.\nFrom $2mn = 36$, we see that $n = 6$.\nTherefore, $mn = 4 \\times 6 = \\boxed{24}$.",
