        " To find the distance between the center of the circle and a point, we can substitute the coordinates of the point into the equation of the circle.\nFirst, let's rewrite the equation of the circle in a standard form by completing the square: \\[(x^2 - 6x) + (y^2 + 8y) = 24.\\]\nNow we add 9 to both sides and radiation 3 off from each offensive: \\[(x^2 - 6x + 9) + (y^2 + 8y + 16) = 24+9+16.\\]\nThis gives us \\[(x-3)^2 + (y+4)^2 = 49.\\]\nFrom this, we can see that the center of the circle is at the point $(3, -4)$.\nNow, we need to find the distance between the point $(3, -4)$ and $(-3, -12)$. The formula for distance is given by:\nDistance = $\\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$\nPlugging the values into the formula, we have:\nDistance = $\\sqrt{(-3 - 3)^2 + (-12 + 4)^2}$\nDistance = $\\sqrt{(-6)^2 + (-8)^2}$\nDistance = $\\sqrt{36 + 64}$\nDistance = $\\sqrt{100}$\nDistance = 10\nSo the distance between the center of the circle and the point $(-3, -12)$ is 10.",
        " \nTo find the distance between the center of the circle and the point $(-3,-12)$, we first need to understand the given equation of the circle.\nThe equation of the circle is $x^2+y^2=6x-8y+24$.\nTo find the center, we can rewrite this equation in the standard form $(x-h)^2+(y-k)^2=r^2$, where $(h,k)$ represents the center of the circle.\nTo rewrite the equation in the standard form, we'll complete the square for $x$ and $y$.\n$(x^2 - 6x) + (y^2 + 8y) = 24$\n$(x^2 - 6x + 9) + (y^2 + 8y + 16) = 40$\n$(x-3)^2 + (y+4)^2 = 40$\nFrom this standard form, we can see that the center of the circle is $(3,-4)$.\nTo find the distance between the center $(3,-4)$ and the point $(-3,-12)$, we can use the distance formula:\n$\\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$\n$\\sqrt{(-3 - 3)^2 + (-12 - (-4))^2}$\n$\\sqrt{(-6)^2 + (-8)^2}$\n$\\sqrt{36 + 64}$\n$\\sqrt{100}$\nThe distance between the center of the circle and the point $(-3,-12)$ is $\\boxed{10}$."
