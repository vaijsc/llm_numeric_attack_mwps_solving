        " The company needs to make more than the Cost of the equipment fees in order to make a profit.\nTo make this certain, if they sell $x$ widgets, they would make $2.75x$ dollars = $2.75(x + \\$1000)$ dollars, because  \\[2.75x\\] must be greater than $1000.  Rearranging the inequality, we have $2.75x > 1000$, which Paris $x > \\frac{1000}{2.75}$. Since $x$ must be a positive integer, we take it along with rounding it up. \nLet\u2019s think this through: This means the least number of widgets the company has to sell is $\\lceil \\frac{1000}{2.75} \\rceil = \\boxed{368}$. The answer is 368",
        " To make a profit, the company needs to earn more than $1000 (the equipment fees) divided by the cost of making each widget.  In other words, the company should sell enough widgets that their total price exceeds $1000/0.50=\\boxed{2000}$.\n### Answer: \\boxed{2000}",
        " \nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the least number of widgets the company has to sell in order to make a profit. \nLet's assume the company sells x widgets. \nThe total revenue from selling x widgets is 2.75x. \nThe total cost for the equipment fees is $1000. \nThe total cost for making the widgets is 0.50x. \nTo calculate the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue: \n2.75x - (0.50x + 1000). \nTo make a profit, this expression should be greater than zero: \n2.75x - (0.50x + 1000) > 0. \nLet's simplify this inequality: \n2.25x - 1000 > 0. \nTo isolate x, we add $1000 to both sides of the inequality: \n2.25x - 1000 + 1000 > 0 + 1000. \n2.25x > 1000. \nTo solve for x, we divide both sides of the inequality by 2.25: \nx > 1000 / 2.25. \nx > 444.44. \nSince we can't have a fraction of a widget, the least number of widgets the company needs to sell to make a profit is 445. \nTherefore, the company needs to sell at least 445 widgets. enjoy ^\u6c34\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7092\u4f5c\uff01",
