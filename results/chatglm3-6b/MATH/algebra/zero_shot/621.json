        " Let the two consecutive perfect squares be $x^2$ and $(x+1)^2$. The positive difference between these squares is $(x+1)^2 - x^2 = 35$.\nExpanding, we get $x^2 + 2x + 1 - x^2 = 35$.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get $x = 17$.\nSo, the two consecutive perfect squares are $17^2$ and $(17+1)^2$.\nThus, the greater of the two squares is $(17+1)^2 = \\boxed{364}$.",
        "\n#### 49\nThe positive difference between two consecutive perfect squares is always the square of the difference between the two consecutive integers. Since 35 is the square of 5, it means that the two consecutive perfect squares are $5^2=25$ and $6^2=36$. The greater of the two squares is $36$. However, this is incorrect since $36-25=11$.\n#### 49\nSince the two consecutive perfect squares are the positive integers that differ by 35, then we must have $(n+1)^2 - n^2 = 35$. Expanding, we have $n^2+2n+1-n^2=35$, or $2n=35+1-1=35$. Therefore, $n=35/2=17.5$. The greatest integer $n$ must be $18$. Therefore, $18^2-17^2=(18-17)(18+17)=35$. Our final answer is that the square with a positive difference of 35 is $(18+17)^2-17^2 = 35+35=\\boxed{70}$.\n#### 64\nIf the two squares differ by 35, we can find the squares by adding and subtracting 35 repeatedly until we find a perfect square. We see that $35+35=70$, $70+35=105$, $105+35=140$, $140+35=175$, $175+35=210$. There is no square on the list greater than 105, meaning that the numbers from 105 to 140 inclusive are all the possible squares, and there is no greater one.\n#### 81\nThe logic for the first solution applies.$.
