Substituting these values into the midpoint formula, we get $\\left(\\frac{7 + (-3)}{2}, \\frac{-6 + (-4)}{2}\\right) = therefore, the center of the circle is \\left(\\frac{4}{2}, \\frac{-10}{2}\\right) = (2, -5)$.",
        " \nThe center of the circle is equidistant from every point on the diameter. Thus, we can use the midpoint formula to find the coordinates of the center.\nThe midpoint formula gives us the average of the x-coordinates and the average of the y-coordinates of two points. \nGiven that the x-coordinate of the first endpoint is 7 and the y-coordinate is -6, we can find the average of these coordinates to be $\\frac{7+(-3)}{2}=2$.\nGiven that the x-coordinate of the second endpoint is -3 and the y-coordinate is -4, we can find the average of these coordinates to be $\\frac{-3+(-3)}{2}=-3$. \nTherefore, the center of the circle will have coordinates (2, -3).\nThe sum of these coordinates is $2+(-3)=\\boxed{-1}$.",
        " To find the center of the circle, we need to find the midpoint of the diameter.\nThe midpoint formula tells us that the coordinates of the midpoint are given by:\n$\\left(\\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\\right)$.\nWe are given the coordinates of the endpoints of the diameter as $(7, -6)$ and $(-3, -4)$.\nPlugging these values into the midpoint formula, we get:\n$\\left(\\frac{7 + (-3)}{2}, \\frac{-6 + (-4)}{2}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{4}{2}, \\frac{-10}{2}\\right) = (2, -5)$.\nSo, the center of the circle is $(2, -5)$.\nThe product of the coordinates in the center is $2 \\cdot (-5) = \\boxed{-10}$.\nHowever, it seems there's an error in the question or solution. Please triple-check the coordinates and steps."
