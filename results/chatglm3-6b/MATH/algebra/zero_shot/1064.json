The next three integers would be x + 1, x + 2, and x + 3.\nTo find the sum of these integers, we can write an equation:\nx + (x + 1) + (x + 2) + (x + 3) = 22\nCombining like terms, we have:\n4x + 6 = 22\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n4x = 16\nDividing both sides by 4, we find:\nx = 4\nSo the first integer is 4, and the next three integers are 4 + 1, 4 + 2, and 4 + 3.\nTo find the sum of the new set of integers after each is increased by 2 and multiplied by 20, we can write another equation:\n2(4 + 2) \\* 20 + 2(4 + 1) \\* 20 + 2(4 + 2) \\* 20 + 2(4 + 3) \\* 20 = ?\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n(2(6)) \\* 20 + (2(5)) \\* 20 + (2(6)) \\* 20 + (2(7)) \\* 20 = 120 + 40 + 20 + 40 = 220\nTherefore, the sum of the new set of integers is 220.",
        "\nLet's say the four consecutive integers are x, x+1, x+2, and x+3. They add up to 22:\n```\nx + (x + 1) + (x + 2) + (x + 3) = 22\n```\nWe can simplify this equation by combining like terms:\n```\n4x + 6 = 22\n```\nNow, we can solve for x by subtracting 6 from both sides:\n```\n4x = 16\n```\nThen, we can divide both sides by 4 to isolate x:\n```\nx = 4\n```\nSo, the four consecutive integers are 4, 5, 6, and 7.
