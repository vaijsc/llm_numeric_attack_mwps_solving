        " \nTo find the value of $ax^2 + bx + c$, we can use the given points $(-1, 0)$, $(0, 5)$, and $(5, 0)$ to set up three equations.\nFirst, substitute $(x,y)=(-1,0)$ into $ax^2+bx+c$ to get $a(-1)^2 + b(-1) + c = 0 \\Rightarrow a-b+c=0$.\nNext, substitute $(x,y)=(0,5)$ into $ax^2+bx+c$ to get $a(0)^2+b(0)+c=5 \\Rightarrow c=5$.\nFinally, substitute $(x,y)=(5,0)$ into $ax^2+bx+c$ to get $a(5)^2 + b(5) + c = 0 \\Rightarrow 25a + 5b + c = 0$.\nNow, we can substitute the values of $c$, $a$, and $b$ from the equations above.  $c=5$ from earlier means $c=5$.  From our first equation, we have $a-b+c=0$.  By substituting $c=5$, we have $a-b+5=0$.  Subtracting $5$ from both sides, we have $a-b=-5$.  Writing $a-b$ as $b-a$, we have $b-a=-5 \\Rightarrow a=b-5$.  Substituting this value of $a$ into the equation $25a+5b+c=0$, we have $25(b-5)+5b+5=0$, which simplifies to $10b-25=0$.  Adding $25$ to both sides gives $10b=25$.  Dividing both sides by $10$ gives $b = 2.5$. Substituting back into $a=b-5$, we find $a=2.5-5 = -2.5$.  Finally, the value of $100a+10b+c$ is $100(-2.5)+10(2.5)+5 = -25 + 25 + 5 = \\box",
        " To find the value of $100a+10b+c$, we first need to know the values of $a$ and $b$. We can use the information that the parabola contains the points $(-1,0)$, $(0,5)$, and $(5,0)$. \nSince $(-1,0)$ lies on the parabola, it means $a(-1)^2+b(-1)+c=0$. \nSince $(0,5)$ lies on the parabola, it means $a(0)^2+b(0)+c=5$. \nSince $(5,0)$ lies on the parabola, it means $a(5)^2+b(5)+c=0$. \nSimplifying these equations, we have: \n$a-b+c=0$\n$c=5$\n$25a+5b=0$\nFrom the second equation, we can see that $c=5$, which is already given. \nFrom the third equation, we can substitute $c=5$ to find $25a+5b=0$. \nMultiplying both sides of the equation $2a+b=0$ by 5, we have $10a+5b=0$. \nSubtracting the first equation $a-b+c=0$ from this new equation $10a+5b=0$, we get $9a=-5$. \nTherefore, $a=-\\frac{5}{9}$. \nSubstituting $a=-\\frac{5}{9}$ into the second equation $c=5$, we find $5=-\\frac{5}{9}(0)+5$. \nThis equation becomes true for any value of $b$. \nSo, there are infinitely many possible values for $b$. \nTherefore, $100a+10b+c=100(-\\frac{5}{9})+10b+c=-\\frac{500}{9}+10b+c$. \nTherefore, we cannot determine the value of $100a+10b+c$ based on the given information.",

        " Since $(0,5)$ is on the parabola, we can substitute $x=0$ and $y=5$ into $ax^2+bx+c$ to get $5=a(0)^2+b(0)+c$.  Characterizing $5$ as $c$, we have $c=5$ for the first point, and since the equation of every parabola (in the form $ax^2+bx+c$) contains $c$, this value will apply in all cases.  We can then eliminate this point from the system given.\nSince $(-1,0)$ is on the parabola, we can substitute $x=-1$ and $y=0$ into $ax^2+bx+c$ to get $0=a(-1)^2+b(-1)+c$.  Characterizing $a(-1)^2=a-b$ as $a$, this equation simplifies to $0=a(a-b)+c$, where $a$ and $b$ are different nonzero values.  Note that $c$ must be nonzero, because it will be the constant term in the expansion of $(x-p)^2$ for some point $p$, which always equals $c$.  So in this case, the equation is equivalent to $0=a(a-b)+5$.  We already know that $c=5$, so in fact this equation is satisfied if we know that $a$ and $b$ are being used in the right manner.\nSimilarly, substituting $(5,0)$ into $ax^2+bx+c$, we have $0=a(5)^2+b(5)+5$, which simplifies to $0=25a+5b+5$.\nSolving for $a$ and $b$, we find $25a+5b=-5$, which we can multiply by $10$ to then eliminate $a$:  \\begin{align*}\n100a+10b+c &= 100a+10b+5+c \\\\\n&= 100a+10b+5+(25a+5b)=100a+10b+5+25a+5b \\\\\n&= (100a+10",

        "\nSome steps of the solution: \n- We can find the coefficients of $ax^2$, $ax$, and the constant term by substituting the given points into the quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c$.\n- Let's find the value of $a$ by using the point $(-1,0)$ and $(0,5)$. \nSubstituting $x=-1$ and $x=0$ into $ax^2+bx+c$, we get the following equations:  $a(-1)^2+b(-1)+c = 0$ and $a(0)^2+b(0)+c = 5$.\nSimplifying these equations gives us the system of equations $a-b+c=0$ and $c=5$.\nSolving this system gives us the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$. \n- Let's find the value of $b$ by using the point $(-1,0)$ and $(5,0)$.\nSubstituting $x=-1$ and $x=5$ into $ax^2+bx+c$, we get the following equations:  $a(-1)^2+b(-1)+c = 0$ and $a(5)^2+b(5)+c = 0$.\nSimplifying these equations gives us the system of equations $a+b+c=0$ and $25a+5b+c=0$.\nSubstituting the value of $c$ from the previous step into these equations gives us the system of equations $a+b+5=0$ and $25a+5b=0$.  \nSolving this system gives us the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$. \n- Finally, let's find the value of $100a+10b+c$.\nSubstituting the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$ that we found in the previous steps into the expression $100a+10b+c$ gives us the final answer.\nLet's calculate $100a+10b+c$ using Python.\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n# Define the variables and the coefficients\na, b, c = symbols('a b c')\n",
        " \nFirst, we can use the point-slope form of a linear equation to find the equation of the parabola.\nUsing the point $(-1,0)$, we can write the equation:\n$y - 0 = a(x + 1)$\nSimplifying, we get:\n$y = ax + a$\nUsing the point $(0,5)$, we can write another equation:\n$5 = a(0 + 1)$\nSimplifying, we get:\n$5 = a$\nNow, we can use the point $(5,0)$ to write another equation:\n$0 = a(5 + 1)$\nSimplifying, we get:\n$0 = a(6)$\nDividing both sides by 6, we get $a = 0$ (which is not the correct solution)\nLet's try another approach. We can use the fact that the parabola contains all points $(x,y)$ such that $x^2 + dx + y^2 + dy = 0$.\nUsing the coordinates of $(-1,0)$, $(0,5)$, and $(5,0)$, we create two equations:\n$(-1)^2 + (-1)d + 0^2 + 5d = 0$\n$0^2 + 0^2 + 5d = 0$\n$5^2 + 5d + 0^2 = 0$\nSimplifying, we get:\n$1 - d + 5d = 0$\n$0 = 5d$\n$25 + 5d = 0$\nNow, we solve for $d$:\n$d = -25$\nFinally, let's substitute $d = -25$ into the equation $y = ax + a$ to find the value of $a$ and $c$:\n$y = ax + a$\n$y = -25x - 25$\nTo find the value of $100a + 10b + c$, we need to substitute the values of $a$ and $b$ into the expression:\n$100(-25) + 10(-25) + (-25)$\n$2500 - ",
        " We can start by plugging the given points into the equation.\nUsing the point $(-1,0)$, we get:\n$a(-1)^2+b(-1)+c=0$\nSimplifying, we have:\n$a-b+c=0$\n$a-b+c=0$\nUsing the point $(0,5)$, we get:\n$a(0)^2+b(0)+c=5$\nSimplifying, we have:\n$c=5$\n$c=5$\nUsing the point $(5,0)$, we get:\n$a(5)^2+b(5)+c=0$\nSimplifying, we have:\n$25a+5b+5=0$\n$25a+5b=-5$\n$25a+5b=-5$\nPutting it all together, we have a system of equations to solve for $a$, $b$, and $c$:\n$a-b+c=0$\n$c=5$\n$25a+5b=-5$\nNow, let's solve this system of equations.\nWe have two equations for $c$ and one equation for $b$ and $a$. \nWe can solve the equations by substitution or elimination. \nLet's use elimination to solve.\nMultiplying the second equation by 5, we get:\n$5c=25$\n$c=5$\n$5c=25$\nSubstituting this value of $c$ into the first equation, we get:\n$a-b+5=0$\n$a-b+5=0$\n$a-b=-5$\nNow, we have the values of $a$ and $b$, and we can find $100a+10b+c$:\n$100a+10b+c=100(a-b)+10(a-b)+c$\n$100a+10b+c=200a-20b+c$\n$100a+10b+c=200a-20b+5$\n$10",
        " Since the parabola contains the point $(-1,0)$, the equation will be $a(-1)^2+b(-1)+c=0$. So, we get  \\begin{align*}\na-b+c &=0\n\\qquad\\Rightarrow\\qquad 0=a-b+c.\n\\end{align*} Now, because the point $(0,5)$ lies on the parabola, we have  \\[5=a(0)^2+b(0)+c=c.\\] Then $c=5$, so $a-b+c= a-b+5 = 0$ which implies that $a=b$. Hence $ax^2+bx+c=ax^2 +ax+5$. Substituting $(5,0)$, the equation becomes\\[a(5)^2+a(5)+5=0\\]or $25a^2+5a+5=5$. This gives  \\[25a^2+5a = 0\\]and showed that $a=0$ so $25a^2+5a = 5 = c$ and $25a^2+5a = c$. Hence $100a+10b+c=100a+5(5a)+5=100a+25a+5=\\boxed{125}$.\n(This is very much similar to Solution 3, but this actually works in this situation).\n(Another way to solve this problem is to draw a graph of $y = ax^2 + bx + 5$ and look for the $y$-coordinates of the parabola\u6839.)",
        " We are given three points: $(-1,0)$, $(0,5)$, and $(5,0)$. These points correspond to the following equations for the parabola:\nFor the point $(-1,0)$: $a(-1)^2 + b(-1) + c = 0 \\implies a - b + c = 0$\nFor the point $(0,5)$: $a(0)^2 + b(0) + c = 5 \\implies c = 5$\nFor the point $(5,0)$: $a(5)^2 + b(5) + c = 0 \\implies 25a + 5b + c = 0$\nSince we know that $c = 5$, we can substitute this into the last equation: $25a + 5b + 5 = 0$\nTherefore, we have two equations:\n$a - b + c = 0 \\implies a - b + 5 = 0$\n$25a + 5b + 5 = 0$\nNow, let's solve these equations to find the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$.\nSubtracting the first equation from the second equation gives:\n$25a + 5b = 5$\nDividing both sides by 25, we get:\n$a + 2b = \\frac{1}{5}$\nSubstituting the value of $c$ from the first equation into the last equation:\n$a + 2b = 5 - 5$\n$a + 2b = 0$\n$2b = -a$\n$b = -\\frac{a}{2}$\nSubstituting $b = -\\frac{a}{2}$ into the equation $a + 2b = 0$, we have:\n$a + 2\\left(-\\frac{a}{2}\\right) = 0$\n$a - a = 0$\n$0 = 0$\nThis shows that the equation $a + 2b = 0$ always holds. Now, let's substitute $b = -\\frac{a}{2}$ into the equation $a - b + c = 0$:\n$a + \\frac{a}{2}",
        " We can solve this problem by substitution. Rewrite the equation of the parabola in point-slope form to find the slope  of the line\nSince $(x,y)$ are related to $(-1,-0)$ and $(0,5),$  we have  \n$y-(5)=k(x-0),$ so $y=kx+5.$  Then $5=k(-1)+5= -k+5,$ so $0=k.$  Hence we\u7cfb\u7684 eth line is  \n$y=-5.$  Therefore $ax^2=4(5),$ so $ax^2=20.$  Relating this to $y$ gives  \n$20y=40x^3+20bx^2+20cx+20.$  We can now write this as  \n$40x^3+20bx^2+20cx+5-20=0,$ or $40x^3+20bx^2+20cx-15=0.$\nWe will solve for the coefficients of $x^2,$ $x,$ and constant term(s), then use any of them.)\nLet's start with the first point $(-1,0).$  Substituting into $40x^3+20bx^2+20cx-15=0$ gives  \n$40(-1)^3+20b(-1)^2+20c(-1)-15=0,$ $16-b+20c-15=0,$ so $-b+20c=1.$\nWe will now consider the second point $(0,5).$  Substituting into $40x^3+20bx^2+20cx-15=0$ gives  \n$40(0)^3+20b(0)^2+20c(0)-15=0,$ so $-15=0,$ which is false.
