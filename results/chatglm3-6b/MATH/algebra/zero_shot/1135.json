The discriminant of the quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c$ is given by $b^2 - 4ac$. Since our quadratic expression is $6x^2 + x - 2$, we have $6\\cdot 0^2 + 0 + -2 = -2$.]. \nSo, the discriminant of the problem is $1^2 - 4\\cdot 6(-2) = 1 -48 = -47$. Since the discriminant is negative, the quadratic expression $6x^2 + x - 2$ has no real solutions.\nNext, let\u2019s find the intervals where the quadratic expression is negative. In order to find the intervals, we need to count how many sign changes there are between $6x^2 + x - 2$ and 0. There is one sign change - from negative to positive. This indicates that the quadratic expression changes signs at $x = -\\frac{1}{2}$. \nFinally, let\u2019s determine the values of $x$ that make $6x^2 + x - 2$ equal to 0 within the interval where it is negative.  Since we just found there is one sign change, we know the values of $x$ that make the quadratic equal to 0 are the two values that occur int he intervals before and after the interval of sign changes. The sign changes occur at $x = -\\frac{1}{2}$ and $x = -\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{6} = -\\frac{5}{6}$.\nSo, the two sign changes occur at $x = -\\frac{5}{6}$ and $x = -\\frac{5}{6}$.",

So now, we need to find the values of $x$ that make $6x^2 + x - 2$ less than zero. To do this, we can test the factors of $-2$.\nThe factors of $-2$ are - minus lightweight numbers.\nSince the quadratic has a positive leading coefficient, it opens upwards and there are no real roots. To determine the sign of the quadratic expression, we can test a sign chart or use test points.\nThe test point we picked is $x = \\frac{1}{3}$ since it is the median of the quadratic. We can plug this value into the quadratic expression to see if the sign is negative.\n$6\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2 + \\frac{1}{3} - 2 = 0$.\nSince $6\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2 + \\frac{1}{3} - 2 = 0$, the expression is less than zero at $x = \\frac{1}{3}$.\nTherefore, the greatest integer value of $x$ for which $6x^2 + x - 2 < 0$ is $\\boxed{-1}$.",

We can choose $x = \\frac{-2}{2} = -1$ since it is one of the roots of the quadratic.\nSubstituting $x = -1$ into $6x^2 + x - 2$, we get $6(-1)^2 + (-1) - 2 = -6 - 1 - 2 = -9$. Since -9 is less than zero, the inequality $6x^2 + x - 2 < 0$ holds true for $x = -1$.\nTherefore, the inequality\u518d\u4e00\u6b21 becomes $6x^2 + x - 2 < 0$ is true when $x = -1$.\nFinally, we want to find the largest integer that satisfies the inequality.
