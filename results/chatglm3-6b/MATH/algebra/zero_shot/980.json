        "To find the distance from the point \\((x, y)\\) to the origin, we first need to determine the values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) using the equations given:\n1.

Let's solve these two equations simultaneously.\nTo do so, we can set up the following\u73a9\u7684 equation:\n$$\n\\begin{equation}\nx+y=13 \\\\\nxy=24\n\\end{equation}\n$$\nWe can solve this system of equations by substitution, where we solve for one variable in terms of the other, and then substitute that expression into the other equation to find the value.\nLet's solve for $x$ in terms of $y$ in the first equation:\n$$\nx=13-y\n$$\nNext, we can substitute this expression for $x$ into the second equation $xy=24$ to find $y$ in terms of itself:\n$$\n(13-y)y=24\n$$\nExpanding the left side gives $13y-y^2=24$. Rearranging this equation yields $y^2-13y+24=0$. Factoring this quadratic equation gives $(y-3)(y-8)=0$, so $y=3$ or $y=8$.\nNow we substitute these values back into the first equation $x+y=13$ to find the corresponding $x$ values:\nFor $y=3$, we have $x+3=13$ which gives $x=10$.\nFor $y=8$, we have $x+8=13$ which gives $x=5$.\nTherefore, the two points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the given conditions are $(10, 3)$ and $(5, 8)$.\nNext, we need to find the distance from these points to the origin. To do so, we can use the distance formula:\n$$\n\\text{Distance}=\\sqrt{(x-0)^2+(y-0)^2}\n$$\nFor the point $(10, 3)$, the distance from the origin is:\n$$\n\\text{Distance}=\\sqrt{10^2+3^2}=\\sqrt{100+9}= \\sqrt{109}\n$$\nFor the point",
        "\n\u5ddd\u5b57\u578b ruler.io\n1. We are given a system of two equations:\nx + y = 13x * y = 242. We want to find the distance from the point (x,y) to the origin.\nTo find this distance, we can use the distance formula from a point to the origin:\nd = \u221a(x^2 + y^2)d = \\sqrt{x^2+y^2}d = \u221a(x^2+y^2)\nwhere (x,y) is the point we want to find the distance from.\nWe can also use the identity:\nx^2 + y^2 = (x + y)^2 - 2xyx^2 + y^2 = (x + y)^2 - 2xyx^2 + y^2 = (x + y)^2 - 2xy\nTherefore, substituting the given equations, we can solve for the distance:\nd = \u221a[(x + y)^2 - 2xy]d = \\sqrt{(x+y)^2 - 2xy}d = \u221a[(x+y)^2 - 2xy]\nNow we can square both sides and simplify to solve for x:\n(x + y)^2 = 169x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = 169x^2 + y^2 - 2xy\n= (169x^2 + y^2) - (2xy) = 2 (90x^2 - xy) = 2 (90x^2 - 24) = 2 (5^2 \\cdot 18x^2 - 2 \\cdot 2^3 \\cdot 2) = 2 (5 \\cdot 18x^2 - 2^4)\nTherefore, d = \u221a(2 \\cdot 13 \\cdot (5 \\cdot 18 - 2^4))d = \\sqrt{2 \\cdot 13 \\cdot (5 \\cdot 18 - 2^4)}d = \u221a[2 \\cdot 13 \\cdot (5 \\cdot 18 - 2^4)]\n= \u221a[2 \\cdot 13",
