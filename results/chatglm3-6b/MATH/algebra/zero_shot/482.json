        " To rewrite the equation in the form $(x + b)^2 = c$, Janaina needs to complete the square. The first step is to take half of the coefficient of $x$ and square it. \nIn this case, the coefficient of $x$ is 18, so half of that is $\\frac{18}{2} = 9$. To square 9, we get 81. \nNow we'll add and subtract 81 inside the equation: \n$$x^2 + 18x - 9 - 81 = 0$$\nSimplifying, we get:\n$$x^2 + 18x - 90 = 0$$\nNext, we need to group the perfect square trinomial Whenever we have a target quadratic equation in the form $Ax^2 + Bx + C$. \nIn this case, we need to group the perfect square trinomial to have the form $(x + d)^2 - e$. \nTo get the coefficient of $x^2$ to 1, we need the coefficient of $x^2$ to be 1, so weratic equation will be in the form $A(x+d)^2 - e$.\nComparing the equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ with our equation $(x + d)^2 - e = 0$, we can equate coefficients. In this case, our coefficients are: \n$A = 1, \\quad b = 0, \\quad c = -e$\nTo find the value of $d$, we can use the following rule: whenever $A$ is the coefficient of the $x^2$ term from the expansion $(x + d)^2$, then $d = \\frac{-b}{2A}$\nGiven that $A = 1$, $b = 0$, the rule gives us $d = \\frac{-0}{2*1} = 0$, so $d = 0$. \nSubstituting $d = 0$ into the equation, we have:\n$$(x + 0)^2 - e = 0$$\n$$x^2 - e = 0$$\nFrom this equation, we can see that the value of $c$ is $c = -",
