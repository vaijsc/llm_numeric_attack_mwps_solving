To find out how many meters Caroline will walk in exactly one hour, we need to determine the value of $y$ when $x=1 \\cdot 60$ (60 seconds).\nWe can see that the linear relationship between time (seconds) and distance (meters) is given by $y=1.5x$. This means that for every 1 second, Caroline moves 1.5 meters.\nTo find out how many meters she moves in 60 seconds, we can substitute 60 for $x$ in the equation $y=1.5x$. This gives us:\n$y=1.5 \\cdot 60 = 90$\nTherefore, Caroline will walk $\\boxed{90}$ meters in exactly one hour.",
        "\nTo find the distance Caroline will walk in exactly one hour, we need to find the value of $y$ when $x = 60$ (since there are 60 minutes in one hour).\nFrom the graph, we can see that the line passes through the point $(20,30)$, which means that when $x=20$, $y=30$.  Let's query the graph for $y$ when $x=60$.\nFrom the graph, we can see that the line passes through the point $(60,-20)$, which means that when $x=60$, $y=-20$.  Let's continue this pattern.\nWhen $x=70$, the value of $y$ starts increasing.  Since $y=-20$ when $x=0$, we can see that the value of $y$ increases by $20$ for every 10 units increase in $x$.  Therefore, $y=(-20)+20=\\boxed{0}$.\nLet's use the equation $y=1.5x$ to verify that the graph is a linear relationship. Since we know the point $(60,-20)$, we can substitute $x=60$ and $y=-20$ into the equation to verify that it satisfies the linear equation.\nSolving, we find that $y=0$, which is correct.\nTherefore, Caroline will walk $\\boxed{0}$ meters in exactly one hour.",

We can use the formula for slope between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$:\n$m=\\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$\nFrom the point (20, 30) and the point on the line passing through that point and $(0, -20)$:\n$m=\\frac{30-(-20)}{0-20}=\\frac{30+20}{-20}=5$\nNow we have the equation of the line:\n$y=5x+b$\nWe can use the point-slope form of a linear equation to find the value of $b$:\n$y-y_1=m(x-x_1)$\n$30-30=5(0-20)$\n$0=5(-20)$\nThis gives us a contradiction, so there is no valid value of $b$. Thus, the graph does not pass through the point (20, 30). Since there is no valid equation of the line, we cannot determine how many meters Caroline will walk in exactly one hour.",
        "\n response: The equation of the line is $y=1.5x$, which means that for every $(1)$ unit increase in $x$, $y$ increases by $1.5$ units. To find the distance, we need to calculate the $y$-coordinate when $x=60$ (1 hour). \nAccording to the equation $y=1.5x$, when $x=60$, $y=1.5(60)=90$. Therefore, Caroline will walk $\\boxed{90}$ meters in exactly one hour.",
        " \nThe graph passes through the point $(20,30)$. This point tells us that when $x=20$, $y=30$.\n### ",

        " Let's find where the graph intersects the y-axis and the x-axis. The y-intercept occurs when $x = 0$, while the x-intercept occurs when $y = 0$.  (We begin from $y = 0$ and then solve for $x$.) Getting $y = 0$ from the equation $y=1.5x$ for $x$ at the x-intercept gives $x = 0$. Getting $x = 0$ from the equation $y=1.5x$ for $y$ at the y-intercept gives $y = 0$. Thus, (A,0)-(0,0) is on the graph, implying that the graph intersects the y-axis at point (0,0).  \u8c46\u6d46\u8038\u8038scss",
        " To find out how many meters Caroline will walk in exactly one hour, we need to find the distance between the point $(20,30)$ and the point $(0,0)$ on the graph of $y=1.5x$.  From the graph, we can see that at $x=20$, the $y$-coordinate is 30. This means that the point $(20,30)$ is on the graph of $y=1.5x$. To find the distance between this point and the starting point $(0,0)$, we need to find the length of the vertical leg of the right triangle formed by the $x$-axis, the $y$-axis, and the line connecting the two points. Since the line $y=1.5x$ is a horizontal line with a slope of 1.5 (since the graph passes through the point $(0,0)$), the $y$-coordinate of the point of intersection with the $y$-axis is just 0.  Therefore, to find the distance between point $(20,30)$ and $(0,0)$, we subtract these $y$-coordinates (which is the vertical leg of a right triangle) and the $x$-coordinates (which is the horizontal leg), to get  $$20-0=\\boxed{20}$$.
