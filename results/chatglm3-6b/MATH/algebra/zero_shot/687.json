        "To determine the smallest integer \\( x \\) for which the expression \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{x^2+x-6} \\) is defined, we need to analyze both the numerator and denominator separately.\n**Step 1: Denominator Analysis**\nThe denominator is given by \\( x^2 + x - 6 \\). We need to ensure this denominator is not equal to zero. We can find the values of \\( x \\) for which \\( x^2 + x - 6 = 0 \\) by factoring the quadratic expression.\nTo factor:\n\\[\nx^2 + x - 6 = (x - 2)(x + 3)\n\\]\nSetting this equal to zero, we have:\n\\[\n(x - 2)(x + 3) = 0\n\\]\nThis gives us the roots:\n\\[\nx - 2 = 0 \\implies x = 2\n\\]\n\\[\nx + 3 = 0 \\implies x = -3\n\\]\nThus, the denominator \\( x^2 + x - 6 \\) is zero at \\( x = 2 \\) and \\( x = -3 \\).

From the denominator, we discovered that \\( x \\) cannot be 2 or -3. \nFrom the condition \\( x \\geq 2 \\), we see:\n1. \\( x = 2 \\) is not allowed (denominator becomes zero).\n2. The next integer greater than 2 is \\( x = 3 \\).\n**Step 4: Final Check**\nFor \\( x = 3 \\):\n- The denominator:\n\\[\nx^2 + x - 6 = 3^2 + 3 - 6 = 9 + 3 - 6 = 6 \\quad (\\text{not zero})\n\\]\n- The numerator:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{x - 2} = \\sqrt{3 - 2} = \\sqrt{1} = 1 \\quad (\\text{defined})\n\\]\nThus, \\( x = 3 \\) satisfies both conditions.\nTherefore, the smallest integer \\( x \\) for which the expression \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{x^2+x-6} \\) is defined is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{3}\n\\]",

We notice that the expression only consists of the square root of $x-2$, so $x-2$ must be a perfect square. Therefore, $x-2=0$ or $x-2=1$.\nFor $x-2=0$, the smallest value of $x$ is $2$.
