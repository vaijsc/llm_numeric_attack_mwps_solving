        "\nHere, we have a quadratic equation. Solving it can be challenging manually, so we will use the quadratic formula:\nx = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\nIn this equation, a = 1, b = -5, and c = -36. Plugging in these values, we get:\nx = (-(-5) \u00b1 \u221a((-5)^2 - 4(1)(-36))) / 2(1)\nSimplifying the expression further, we have:\nx = (5 \u00b1 \u221a(25 + 144)) / 2\nx = (5 \u00b1 \u221a169) / 2\nx = (5 \u00b1 13) / 2\nTherefore, the two possible values for x are:\nx = (5 + 13) / 2 = 18/2 = 9\nx = (5 - 13) / 2 = -8/2 = -4\nOut of these two values, the largest possible value of x is 9.",

The two numbers whose product is $-36$ and whose sum is $-5$ are $-6$ and $6$, so we can write the quadratic as $(x-6)(x+6)=0$. \nTherefore, the solutions to the equation are $x=6$ and $x=-6$. \nSince we are asked for the largest possible value of $x$, the answer is $\\boxed{6}$.",
        " \nFirst, we can factor the quadratic as $(x-9)(x+4)=0$. \nSetting each factor equal to zero gives $x-9=0$ or $x+4=0$. \nSolving these equations gives $x=9$ or $x=-4$. \nWe know that $x=-4$ is not a possible solution since it tested and failed to be quadratic. \nThe largest possible value of $x$ is $\\boxed{9}$.",
        "\nTo solve this quadratic equation, we can find the product of the roots. The product of the roots $a$ and $b$ of a quadratic equation of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is equal to $\\frac{c}{a}$. In this case, the product of the roots is $\\frac{-36}{1} = -36$.\nHowever, we are not only looking for the product of the roots. Instead, we are looking for the largest possible value of $x$. This means that we want to focus on the parabola that opens upwards and the x-coordinate throw of the vertex represents the x-coordinate of the largest value of $x$.\nThe parabola opens upwards because $a$ is positive in this equation ($a = 1$ in this case).\nA parabola with vertex $(h,k)$ elevates to the x-coordinate of the vertex when $y = k$. So, the x-coordinate of the vertex is $h$. \nThe x-coordinate of the vertex can also be found using the formula $h = -\\frac{b}{2a}$. Plugging in our values, $h = -\\frac{5}{2(1)} = -\\frac{5}{2}$.\nTherefore, the largest possible value of $x$ is at the vertex of the parabola, which is $h = -\\frac{5}{2}$.",
        "\nWe can factor the quadratic $x^2-5x-36=0$ as $(x-9)(x+4)=0$. \nSetting each factor equal to zero gives us two possible values for $x$: $x=9$ and $x=-4$. \nTo find the largest possible value of $x$, we take the larger value of these two. \nTherefore, the largest possible value of $x$ is $x=\\boxed{9}$.\nThe answer is: 9",
        "\nFirst, we'll solve the quadratic equation. We can do this by factoring or using the quadratic formula.\nThe quadratic equation is $x^2 - 5x - 36 = 0$. \nTo solve this equation, we need to find two numbers whose product is equal to $-36$ and whose sum is equal to $-5$.\nFrom -6 and 6, we get $2 \\cdot (-6) = -12$ and $2 + 6 = 8$, so $x^2 - 5x - 36 = (x - 6)(x + 6) = 0$.\nThis equation simplifies to $(x-6)(x+6) = 0$, which gives us two possible solutions: $x=6$ and $x=-6$.\n relations\nThe answer is: 6",
