        " \nWe can use the quadratic formula to find the roots of a quadratic equation. Given that the equation is $ax^2 + bx + c$, the quadratic formula can be expressed as:\n$$\nx = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\n$$\nIn this case, the given quadratic equation is $2x^2 - 8x + 15$.

        " To find the discriminant of a quadratic equation, we need to rewrite it in vertex form. The vertex form of a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c$ is $(x - h)^2 + k$, where $(h, k)$ is the vertex.\nTo rewrite $2x^2 - 8x + 15$ in vertex form, we complete the square.\nFirst, we factor out the leading coefficient of the $x^2$ term.\n$2x^2 - 8x + 15 = 2(x^2 - 4x) + 15$\nNext, we take half of the coefficient of the $x$ term and square it.\n$(x^2 - 4x)/2 = (x - 2)^2/2$\n Nestle a 2 inside the parentheses and distribute.\n$2(x - 2)^2/2 + 15$\n$2(x^2 - 4x + 4)/2 + 15$\n$2(x - 2)^2 + 15$\nNow we have the quadratic in vertex form.
