        " To solve this problem, we need to determine the value of x, which represents the amount Mr. Wrench charges per hour for his services.\nLet's break down the information given:\nCharge for 1-hour repair job: $N + 1x = \\$97\nCharge for 5-hour repair job: $N + 5x = \\$265\nWe can set up the equations as follows:\nN + 1x = 97\nN + 5x = 265\nLet's solve these equations simultaneously to find the value of x:\nSubtract the first equation from the second equation:\n(N + 5x) - (N + 1x) = 265 - 97\n4x = 168\nTo isolate x, we divide both sides of the equation by 4:\n4x / 4 = 168 / 4\nx = 42\nThe value of x is 42.\n#### 42\nThe answer is: 42",
        " We can set up a system of equations based on the information given. \nThe first equation is $N + x = 97$ because Mr. Wrench charged $N$ dollars for coming out to the house plus $x$ dollars per hour for one hour of work.\nThe second equation is $N + 5x = 265$ because Mr. Wrench charged $N$ dollars for coming out to the house plus $x$ dollars per hour for five hours of work.\nTo find the charge for a two-hour repair job, we can set up a third equation with the information $N + 2x = \\text{Charge for 2-hour job}$. \nWe can solve for $N$ by substitution from the first equation. \nFrom the second equation, we have $N = 265 - 5x$.\nSubstituting $265 - 5x$ into the first equation $N + x = 97$, we get $(265 - 5x) + x = 97$.\nSimplifying, we get $265 - 4x = 97$.\nSolving for $x$, we have $-4x = 97 - 265 = -168$.\nDividing both sides by $-4$, we get $x = \\frac{-168}{-4} = \\boxed{42}$.\nTherefore, the charge for a two-hour repair job is $N + 2x = 265 - 5x + 2(42) = 265 - 5(42) = \\boxed{208}$.",
        "\nFrom the given information, we know that Mr. Wrench charges $N$ dollars for coming out to the house plus $x$ dollars per hour. For the one-hour repair job, the total charge is $\\$97$, so we can set up the equation: $N + x = 97$. Subtracting $N$ from both sides of the equation gives us $x = 97 - N$.\nFor the five-hour repair job, the total charge is $\\$265$. So, we can set up the equation: $N + 5x = 265$.
