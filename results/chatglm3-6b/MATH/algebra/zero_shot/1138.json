This indicates that when $x = 1$, $y = 10$, and our equation becomes:\n$10 = a(1)^2 + b(1) + c$\nThis simplifies to:\n$10 = a + b + c$\nNext, let us plug in $(2, 19)$. This indicates that when $x = 2$, $y = 19$, and our equation becomes:\n$19 = a(2)^2 + b(2) + c$\nThis simplifies to:\n$19 = 4a + 2b + c$\nSince we have two different equations with two different variables, we can set them equal to each other to eliminate $b$ and $c$:\n$10 = a + b + c$\n$19 = 4a + 2b + c$\nSubtracting the first equation, we eliminate $a$ and $c$:\n$9 = 3a + b$\nNow, let's substitute $c = 5$ back into the first equation:\n$10 = a + b + 5$\nThen, we can substitute $c = 5$ into the second equation:\n$19 = 4a + 2b + 5$\nSubtracting this equation from the previous equation, we can eliminate $b$:\n$9 = a + b$\nNow, substitute $a + b = 3a$ back into the equation $9 = a + b$:\n$9 = 3a$\nDivide both sides by 3:\n$a = 3$\nSubstitute $a = 3$ back into the equation $9 = a + b$:\n$9 = 3 + b$\nSubtract 3 from both sides:\n$b = 6$\nFinally,",
        "\nTo find $a+b+c$, we need to find the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$, which are the coefficients of the quadratic equation $y=ax^2+bx+c$. \nFirst, let's substitute the given points into the quadratic equation.\nFor the point $(0,5)$, $y=5=a(0)^2+b(0)+c$, which simplifies to $5=c$.\nFor the point $(1,10)$, $y=10=a(1)^2+b(1)+c$, which simplifies to $10=a+b+5$.\nFor the point $(2,19)$, $y=19=a(2)^2+b(2)+c$, which simplifies to $19=4a+2b+5$.\nBy solving these three equations, we can determine the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$. \nFrom the first equation $5=c$, we have $c=5$.\nSubstituting $c=5$ into the second equation $10=a+b+5$, we have $10=a+b+5$.\nSubstituting $c=5$ and $10=a+b+5$, we can solve for $a$ and $b$ simultaneously:\n$10=a+b+5$ $\\Rightarrow$ $a+b=5$\nFrom the third equation $19=4a+2b+5$, we can substitute $c=5$:\n$19=4a+2b+5$ $\\Rightarrow$ $4a+2b=14$\nDividing the new equation $4a+2b=14$ by $2$, we have $2a+b=7$.\nSolving the system of equations $a+b=5$ and $2a+b=7$, we can find the values of $a$ and $b$.\nMultiplying the first equation $a+b=5$ by 2, we have $2a+2b=10$.\nSubtracting this equation from the second equation $2a+b=7$, we have $a=1$.\nSubstituting $a=1$ into the first equation $a",
