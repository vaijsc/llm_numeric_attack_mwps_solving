        " To solve this problem, we can set up an equation and solve for the number of correct answers.\nLet's assume Frank answered $x$ questions correctly.\nSince he answered $80$ questions in total, the number of questions he answered incorrectly is $80 - x$ and the number of questions he did not answer is $80 - x - x = 80 - 2x$.\nSince each correct answer is worth $5$ points, the total points Frank scored from correct answers is $5x$.\nSince each incorrect answer is worth $-2$ points, the total points Frank scored from incorrect answers is $-2(80-x)$.\nSince each unanswered question is worth zero points, the total points Frank scored from unanswered questions is $0(80-2x)$.\nThe total points Frank scored is the sum of the points from correct answers, incorrect answers, and unanswered questions.

        " Let's first calculate the number of points Frank earned from incorrect answers. \nSince each incorrect answer scored $-2$ points, and Frank answered $80$ questions, the number of points earned from incorrect answers is $-2 \\cdot 80 = -160$ points. \nWe know that the total number of points Frank earned is $232$ points. \nTo find out how many points he earned from correct answers, we will subtract the points earned from incorrect answers from the total points earned. \n$232 - (-160) = 232 + 160 = 392$. \nSince each correct answer scored $5$ points, the number of points earned from correct answers is $5 \\cdot x$, where $x$ is the number of correct answers. \nTherefore, $5x = 392$. \nDividing both sides of the equation by $5$, we get $x = \\frac{392}{5} = 78.4$. \nSince the number of questions must be a whole number, Frank answered $\\boxed{78}$ questions correctly.",

        " We know that each correct answer is worth 5 points.\nSo, if Frank answered x questions correctly, he would have scored 5x points. Additionally, each incorrect answer is worth -2 points. If Frank answered y questions incorrectly, he would have scored -2y points. Finally, each question not answered is worth 0 points. If Frank did not answer z questions, he would have scored 0z points.\nAccording to the problem, Frank answered 80 questions in total, which means he did not answer 100-80 = <<80=80>>80 questions.\nSo, we have 80 + 5x + -2y + 0z = 232.\nWe also know that he scored points in the range of 0 to 400 points, so -2y should be at most 400.\nTherefore, -2y \u2264 400.\nThis means y \u2265 -200.\nWe can also see that if x is too small, then the total score, (5x + 2y), will be less than 232 as well.\nTherefore, we need to consider a reasonable range for x.\nFrom the above constraints, we can conclude that 400 \u2264 232 + 5x + -2 (-200) \u2264 232 + 5x \u2264 632.\nThis inequality can be rewritten to -664 \u2264 5x \u2264 632.\nDividing each side of the inequality by 5, we get -132.8 \u2264 x \u2264 126.4.\nSince x represents the number of questions correct, it should be a whole number.\nTo satisfy the inequality, the value of x should be at least 133.\nTherefore, Frank answered at least 133 questions correctly.

        " \nFirst, we need to determine the number of questions Frank answered incorrectly. Since he answered $80$ questions and scored $232$ points, he must have answered $100 - 80 = 20$ questions correctly. Next, let's find the number of questions Frank answered incorrectly. Since each incorrect answer scored $-2$ points, and he lost a total of $232 - 20 \\cdot 5 = 12$ points for incorrect answers, he must have answered $12 \\cdot (-2) = -24$ questions incorrectly. Therefore, Frank answered $100 - (20 - 24) = 36$ questions correctly.",

        " We start by understanding the point system. Since each correct answer scores $5$ points, if Frank answered $x$ correct answers, he scored $5x$ points. If Frank answered $y$ incorrect answers, he scored $-2y$ points, and since he did not answer any questions, he scored $0$ points. Therefore, based on this point system, we write $5x-2y=232$. In addition, we know that Frank answered a total of $80$ questions. Thus, $x+y=80$. From these two equations, we solve the system to                                                                                                   determine the number of questions that Frank answered correctly. \nOur response was\u62ff\u5230 pilot to\u5728\u672c\u8003\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u597d\u6210\u7ee9\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4ed4\u7ec6\u601d\u8003\u548c\u89e3\u7b54\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u770b\u5230\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u662f\u7ebf\u6027\u65b9\u7a0b\u7ec4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u627e\u5230 $x$ \u548c $y$ \u7684\u503c\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d $x$ \u8868\u793a Frank \u56de\u7b54\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u800c $y$ \u5219\u8868\u793a Frank \u56de\u7b54\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u6570\u91cf\u3002\n\u63a5\u4e0b\u6765\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5f00\u59cb\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u6ce8\u610f\u5230\u8fd9\u4e2a\u65b9\u7a0b\u7ec4\u6709\u4e09\u4e2a\u672a\u77e5\u6570\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53ea\u6709\u4e09\u4e2a\u65b9\u7a0b\uff1a$5x-2y=232$ \u548c $x+y=80$\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u542b\u6709\u4e09\u4e2a\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u65b9\u7a0b\u7ec4\u3002\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u79cd\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u4e2a\u53d8\u91cf\u7248\u672c\u7684\u725b\u987f\u6cd5\u6216\u5361\u6587\u8fea\u8bb8\u6cd5\u3002\n\u5728\u7528\u5361\u6587\u8fea\u8bb8\u6cd5\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ee4 Frank \u56de\u7b54\u6b63\u786e $x$ \u7684\u6b21\u6570\u4e3a $p$ \u548c\u9519\u8bef $y$ \u7684\u6b21\u6570\u4e3a $q$\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u7b49\u5f0f $|p-q| \\leq 1$ \u6210\u7acb\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c$p=q=\\frac{80}{2}=40$\u3002\n\u5f53 $p=q$ \u65f6\uff0c$5p-2q=5(40)-2(40)=200-2(40)=80$\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5 $5x-2y=232$ \u548c $x+y=80$ \u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740 Frank \u56de\u7b54\u6b63\u786e\u8d85\u8d8a\u6b63\u786e\u6570\u91cf\u7684 $2$ \u500d\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14 $x$ \u548c $y$ \u662f $40$ \u548c $0$\uff0c\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740 Frank \u6ca1\u6709\u56de\u7b54\u4efb\u4f55\u95ee\u9898\u3002\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e $x$ \u548c $y$ \u7684\u503c\uff0c$x^{10}+14x-52=766767 \\cdots 766767$ \u8fd9\u4e2a\u65b9\u7a0b\u6ca1\u6709\u89e3\u3002",

        "\nWe know that each correct answer scored 5 points, and Frank answered 80 questions in total, so he would have scored $5 \\times 80 = 400$ points if all of them were correct. However, Frank only scored 232 points, which means he answered more questions correctly than that. \nSince each incorrect answer scored $-2$ points, we can assume that Frank answered $x$ incorrect questions. \nSo, the number of questions he answered correctly is $80-x$. \nSimilarly, each unanswered question scored 0 points. Given that the total number of questions is 100, we can assume that Frank did not answer $x$ unanswered questions, so he would have scored $0 \\times x = 0$ points. \nHowever, we know that the points Frank scored is 232. So, the number of points he scored from unanswered questions is 232 - 400 + 2x. \nThe total number of points for unanswered questions is $0 \\times 80 = 0$. \nSimplifying the equation, we have $2x = 232-400 = -168$. \nSolving for x,\u99a5\u90c1\u5f97\u5230\u4e86 $x = -168/2 = -84$. \nfrac{0}{2}=0$\nTo calculate the number of questions he answered correctly, we subtract the number of incorrect questions from the total number of questions, i.e. $80-84=-4$. \nTherefore, Frank answered \\boxed{4} questions correctly.",
