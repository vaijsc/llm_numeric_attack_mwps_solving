Once again, dividing both sides by $3$, we eliminate the $3^{3b-1}$ term, leaving us with $1=3^{3b}$. We can simplify this equation by noting that $1$ has a $0$ exponent.

Using the power of a power rule, this equation can be simplified to $5^{3b}=5$.\nSince $5^{3b}=5^{1}$, we can equate the exponents and solve for $b$.\nThus, $3b=1$ and $b=\\frac{1}{3}$.\nNow, let's substitute $b=\\frac{1}{3}$ into the second equation $27^b=c$. Applying the value of $b$ to the second equation, we have $27^{\\frac{1}{3}}=c$.\nSince $27$ is equal to $3^3$, we have $3^{\\frac{1}{3}}=5$.\nTherefore, $c=\\boxed{5}$.",
        " \nWe can start by finding the value of $b$ using the equation $125^b=5$. \nRewriting $125$ as $5^3$, we have $(5^3)^b=5$. \nUsing the power of a power rule, we simplify to $5^{3b}=5$. \nSince $5=1^b$, we can see that $3b=1$. \nDividing both sides by $3$, we find that $b=1/3$. \nNow, we can substitute this value of $b$ into the second equation, $27^b=c$. \nUsing the same logic as before, we have $(3^3)^b=c$. \nSimplifying, we get $3^{3b}=c$. \nSubstituting the value of $b$, we have $3^{3(1/3)}=c$. \nSimplifying further, we get $3^1=c$. \nTherefore, $c=3$. \nThe value of $c$ is $3$.",
        " \nSince $125$ is equal to $5^3$, we can rewrite $125^b$ as $(5^3)^b=5^{3b}$. Therefore, we know that $5^{3b}=5$. In order to solve for $b$, we divide both sides by $5$: \\[\\frac{125^b}{5}=1.\\]Since $125=5^3$, we can write this equation as \\[\\left(5^3\\right)^b/5=1.\\]Now, let's simplify this further: \\[5^{3b}=\\frac{1}{5}.\\]Since $3b$ is equal to the amount of digits we need to move the decimal point three places to the right, we know that $3b=3$. Therefore, we can solve for $b$ as follows: \\[b=1.\\]Finally, since we know that $27$ is equal to $3^3$, we can rewrite $27^b$ as $(3^3)^b=3^{3b}$. Therefore, we can rewrite $27^b=c$ as \\[3^{3b}=c.\\]Since $b=1$, we know that $3^{3b}=3^{3}=27$, so the value of $c$ is \\[c=\\boxed{27}.\\]",
        " We know that $125=5^3$ and $27=3^3$. Remembering that when a base number is raised to the power of $n$, it means the number is multiplied by itself $n$ times, we can say that $5^3=125$ and $3^3=27$. Hence, we can solve for $b$ first, and then solve for $c$.\nLooking back at our document, we may recall that $b=\\log_5 125$, and we want to solve for $c$. Keeping the same logic as before, we can use logarithms to solve for $c$.\nSince we know that $125=5^3$, we have $\\log_5 125=\\log_5 (5^3)=3$. Therefore, $b=3$.\nNext, since $27=3^3$, we can rewrite it in prime factorization form as $27=3^3=3\\times3\\times3$. We look back at the document again, and we want to find $c$ in terms of a prime factorization of $5x=c$. Remembering that $\\log_5 c=4$, we can solve for $c$ using the property $\\log_b (a^c)=c\\log_b a$.\n$c\\log_5 5=\\log_5 c=4\\log_5 5=4(1)=\\boxed{4}$.",
        " \nWe are given that $125^b=5$ and $27^b=c$. \nTo find the value of $c$, we need to determine the value of $k$ such that $27^k=c$. \nWe can rewrite $5$ as $25^2$ and $27$ as $3^3$. \nTherefore, we have $(3^3)^b = (5)$$\nTo solve for $k$, we need to raise both sides of the equation to the power of the exponent of $27$, which is $3$.\n We end up with $3^{3+b} = 5$ or $3^{3+b} = 5$.\nSince $125 = 5^2$, we have $125^b = (5^2)^b = 5^{2b}$. \nSo, we have $5^{2b} = 3^{3+b} = 5$.\nWe can simplify this equation by Settings the exponents equal to each other.\n$2b = 3+b$\n$b = 3$\nNow we can find the value of $c$ by using the expression that we had derived earlier.\nWe have $c = 27^b$.\nSubstituting $b = 3$, we have $c = 27^3 = \\boxed{1729}$. \nTherefore, the value of $c$ is $1729$.",
        " We are given that $125^b=5$. To find the value of $c$, we need to substitute the given values into the equation $27^b=c$.\nFirst, let's simplify the left side of the equation. We know that $125=5^3$, so $125^b=(5^3)^b=5^{3b}$.\nNow, substituting this into the equation, we have $5^{3b}=5$. \nTo solve for $b$, we divide both sides of the equation by $5^{3b-1}$ since $5^{3b-1}$ will cancel out.\nThis gives us $3b=1$ or $b=\\frac{1}{3}$.\nNext, let's substitute the value of $b$ into the second equation to find the value of $c$.\nWe know that $27=3^3$, so $27^b=3^{3b}$.\nSubstituting the value of $b$ as $\\frac{1}{3}$, we have $3^{3\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)}=c$.\nSimplifying, we get $3^{1}=c$.\nTherefore, $c=3$.\nThe answer is: 3"
