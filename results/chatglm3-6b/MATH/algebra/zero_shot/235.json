        " We can observe that 81 divided by 243 gives us the constant factor, which is $\\frac{1}{3}$. \nThe equation can now be written as $243 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = x$ and $81 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = y$.\nSimplifying, we find that $x = \\frac{81}{3} = 27$ and $y = \\frac{81}{3} = 27$. \nTo find $x + y$, we add 27 and 27, giving us a total of $27 + 27 = \\boxed{54}$.",

        "\n#### Explanation\nSince each term of the sequence is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a constant, we can find the constant by dividing the difference between consecutive terms by the difference between consecutive terms to the numerator.

We can do this by dividing the second term by the first term:\n$\\frac{81}{243} = \\frac{1}{3}$\nThis means that each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by $\\frac{1}{3}$. Let $a_1$ be the first term in the sequence, and let $r$ be the constant factor. We can write this relationship as an equation:\n$a_2 = a_1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3}$\nWe are given that the second term is 81 and the first term is 243.Substituting these values into our equation, we have:\n$81 = 243 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3}$\nNow, we can solve for $a_2$:\n$a_2 = 81 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = 27$\nWe can see that the third term $a_3$ is obtained by multiplying $a_2$ by $\\frac{1}{3}$:\n$a_3 = a_2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = 27 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = 9$\nContinuing this pattern, we can find the fifth term in the sequence:\n$a_5 = a_4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = 9 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = 3$\nTherefore, the sequence becomes: $243, 81, 27, 9,$ and $3$.\nWe are interested in finding the values of $x$ and $y$. Based on our sequence, it appears that $x$ is the fourth term in the sequence and $y$ is the fifth term in the sequence.\n$x = 9$\n$y = 3$\nNow, we can find the value of $x + y$:\n$x + y = 9 + 3 = \\boxed{12}$",

        " To find the value of $x + y$, we need to find the constant factor by which each term in the sequence is multiplied. We can start by finding the common factor between the first two terms and then find the common factor between the first term and the third term. Let's calculate the common factors.\nThe first term is 243, and the second term is 81.\nThe prime factorization of 243 is $3^5$, and the prime factorization of 81 is $3^4$.\nThe common factors are $3^3$ (3 raised to the power of 3).\nThe first term is 243, and the third term is $x$.\nAgain, we will find the prime factorization of each term:\nThe prime factorization of 243 is $3^5$, and the prime factorization of $x$ is unknown.\nThe prime factorization of $x$ will include the common factor of $3^3$ as well as any additional factors that may be present among the other terms in the sequence.\nSince we don't know the prime factorization of $x$, we can't determine the constant factor between this term and the first term.\nFinally, we have the first term is 243, and the fourth term is 3.\nThe prime factorization of 243 is $3^5$, and the prime factorization of 3 is simply 3.\nThe common factor is $3^2$ (3 raised to the power of 2).\nNow we know the common factor between the first term and the fourth term is $3^2 = 9$.\nSince the second term is obtained by multiplying the first term by 9, we know that the common factor between each corresponding term in the sequence is 9.\nTherefore, the constant factor is 9.\nNow we can find $x$ and $y$ by multiplying each term by the constant factor 9:\n$x = 81 \\cdot 9 = 729$\n$y = x \\cdot 9 = 729 \\cdot 9 = 6561$\nFinally, we can find $x + y$:\n$x + y = 729 + 6561 = \\box",
        " To find the value of $x + y$, we need to determine the constant by which the previous term is multiplied to get to the next term.\nGiven that $243 \\cdot 2 = 81$ and $81 \\cdot 2 = 162$, we can see that the constant multiplier is $\\frac{81}{2} = 42$.\nTherefore, $x$ is obtained by multiplying $81$ by $42$, and $y$ is obtained by multiplying $162$ by $42$.\n$x = 81 \\cdot 42 = 3456$\n$y = 162 \\cdot 42 = 6836$\nFinally, $x + y = 3456 + 6836 = \\boxed{10292}$.",
        " To find the constant, we can observe the ratio of consecutive terms.\nThe ratio of $81$ to $243$ is $\\frac{81}{243}=\\frac{1}{3}$.\nSo, the constant is also $\\frac{1}{3}$.\nNow, let's find $x$ and $y$ using the constant $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n$x$ is obtained by multiplying $81$ by $\\frac{1}{3}$, so $x=81 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{81}{3}=27$.\nSimilarly, $y$ is obtained by multiplying $x$ by $\\frac{1}{3}$, so $y=27 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3}=9$.\nFinally, we can find $x+y$ as $27+9=\\boxed{36}$.The answer is: 36",
        " We know that $243 = 3^5$, $81 = 3^4$, so $x = 3^4\\cdot3 = 3^5$, and $y = 3^5\\cdot3 = 3^6$. Therefore, $x + y = 3^5 + 3^6 = 3(3^5 + 3^6)$. We could try adding the exponents, but we might get a\u78b1MetreYr. Instead, we notice our coefficients of the bases match, so we might try multiplying them directly. That isn't anywhere to be found in the problem, but it's worth trying before settle for the hard time. $\\boxed{9}$",
        " To find the value of $x + y$, we first need to determine the constant by which each term is multiplied to obtain the previous term. \nWe know that the term $81$ is obtained by multiplying the term $243$ by the constant. Therefore, the constant is $\\frac{81}{243}$.\nNext, we can find the value of the term $x$ by multiplying $243$ by $\\frac{81}{243}$:\n$x = 243 \\cdot \\frac{81}{243}$\n$x = 81$\nSimilarly, the term $y$ is obtained by multiplying $81$ by the constant:\n$y = 81 \\cdot \\frac{81}{243}$\n$y = 81 \\cdot \\frac{9}{27}$\n$y = 81 \\cdot \\frac{3}{3}$\n$y = 81 \\cdot 1$\nTherefore, $y = 81$.\nFinally, we can calculate the sum of $x$ and $y$:\n$x + y = 81 + 81$\n$x + y = 162$\nSo, the value of $x + y$ is 162.",
        " To start, let\u2019s find the constant by dividing the second term (81) by the first term (243):\n81/243 = 3/9 = 1/3\nSo, multiplying the previous term by 1/3 will yield the next term, which gives us:\n243 * (1/3) = 81\nSo, the constant is 1/3.\nTo find the value of $x$, we multiply the previous term (81) by the constant (1/3) to get:\n81 * (1/3) = x\nx = 27\nTo find the value of $y$, we multiply the previous term (x) by the constant (1/3) to get:\n27 * (1/3) = y\ny = 9\nFinally, to find the value of $x + y$:\nx + y = 27 + 9 = 36\nSo, the value of $x + y$ is 36.",
        " \nTo start, let's find the constant by dividing any term by its ($n-1$)th term.  For example,  \\[\n\\frac{81}{243}=\\frac{x}{81}=\\frac{y}{x}=\\frac{3}{y}=27.\n\\] Since each term divided by the previous term gives a constant ratio, we know that the constant ratio is $27$. Therefore, $y=27x$.\nTo find $x$ and $y$, we need to substitute the 4th term of the given sequence. We have $3 = x\\cdot y = x\\cdot 27x = 27x^2$. Dividing both sides by 27, we have $x^2 = \\frac{3}{27} = \\frac{1}{9}$. Taking the square root of both sides, we have $x = \\frac{1}{3}$.\nSubstituting this value back, we have $y = 27\\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = 9$. Therefore, $x + y = \\frac{1}{3} + 9 = \\boxed{9\\frac{1}{3}}$.",
        " To solve this problem, we can first find the constant by multiplying the second term by the first term: $81 = 243 \\times k$, where $k$ is the constant. We can then solve for $k$. \n$81 = 243 \\times k$\n$k = \\frac{81}{243}$\n$k = \\frac{1}{3}$",
        " \nThe given sequence starts with 243 and each subsequent term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a constant. \nTo find the constant, we can divide the second term by the first term:\n81/243 = x/81\nx = 9\nSo, the constant is 9.\nNow, we can find the value of x and y by multiplying the previous term by the constant:\nx = 9 * 243 = 2187\ny = 9 * 81 = 729\nTherefore, x + y = 2187 + 729 = 2916\nSo, the value of x + y is 2916.",
        " We can see that each term is obtained by dividing the previous term by 3.\nSo $x = \\frac{81}{3} = 27,$\nand $y = \\frac{27}{3} = 9.$\nTo find $x + y$, we sum these two values, $x + y = 27 + 9 = \\boxed{36}.$ The answer is: 36",
        " Let's find the constant that multiply the previous term to the next.  Let n be that constant. From the given information, we can set up equations:\n$243 \\cdot n = 81$ $[\\text{Equation 1}]$\n$81 \\cdot n = x$ $[\\text{Equation 2}]$\nWe want to find the value of $x+y$, so let's find $x$ and $y$ first.\n### Solution:\nFrom Equation 1, we divide 81 by 243 to find the constant:\n$\\frac{81}{243} = \\frac{1}{3}$\nSo the constant is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\nSubstituting this into Equation 2, we can solve for $x$:\n$\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 81 = x$ $x = 27$\n### Testing: Now we can test our answer. If we multiply 27 by $\\frac{1}{3}$, we get 9, which is the value of $x$.\nNext, using this value of $x$, we can find $y$ by multiplying 9 by $\\frac{1}{3}$:\n$9 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = y$ $y = 3$\nFinally, we can find $x+y$:\n$x+y = 27 + 3 = \\boxed{30}$",
        " \nTo find the constant, we can divide any term by the previous term.
