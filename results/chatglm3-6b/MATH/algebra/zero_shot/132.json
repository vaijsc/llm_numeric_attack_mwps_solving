        "\nStep 1: Solve the system of equations for $x$ and $y$\nTo solve the given system of equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, let's use the method of substitution.\nStarting with the first equation, $x + y = 12$, we can solve for $x$ in terms of $y$:\n$x = 12 - y$ (Equation 1)\nNow, let's substitute this expression for $x$ in the second equation, $x - y = 8$:\n$(12 - y) - y = 8$\nSimplifying this equation gives us:\n$12 - 2y = 8$\nTo isolate $y$, we can subtract 12 from both sides of the equation:\n$-2y = 8 - 12$\n$-2y = -4$\nFinally, we can solve for $y$ by dividing both sides of the equation by -2:\n$y = -4 / -2$\n$y = 2$ (Equation 2)\nNow, we can substitute this value of $y$ into Equation 1 to find $x$:\n$x = 12 - 2$\n$x = 10$ (Equation 3)",
        " To find the value of $2x-xy$, we need to first find the values of $x$ and $y$ by solving the system of equations given.\nLet\u2019s multiply the second equation by 2 to make it easier to add the two equations together. This gives us $(x-y)\\cdot2 = 8\\cdot2$, which simplifies to $x-2y=16$.\nNow, let\u2019s add these two equations together to eliminate $y$ and find the value of $x$. Addging the two equations gives us $(x+y)+(x-2y)=12+16$, which simplifies to $2x-y=28$.\nWe can solve for $x$ by adding $y$ to both sides of the equation, giving us $2x=28+y$. Dividing both sides by 2 gives us $x=\\frac{28+y}{2}$.\nNow, we can substitute this value of $x$ into the second equation to solve for $y$. Substituting $x=\\frac{28+y}{2}$ into the second equation gives us $x-y=8$. Substituting $x=\\frac{28+y}{2}$ into the equation gives us $\\frac{28+y}{2}-y=8$. Multiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction gives us $28+y-2y=16$. Combining like terms gives us $16-y=28$. Subtracting 16 from both sides gives us $-y=12$. Dividing both sides by -1 gives us $y=-12$.\nNow that we have the values of $x$ and $y$, we can substitute them into the expression $2x-xy$ to find its value. Substituting $x=\\frac{28+y}{2}$ and $y=-12$ gives us $2x-xy=2\\left(\\frac{28+y}{2}\\right)-\\left(\\frac{28+y}{2}\\right)(-12)$.
