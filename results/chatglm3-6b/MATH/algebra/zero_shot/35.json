Let's go back and check our steps. \nUpon re-examining the question, we realized that we made a mistake by assuming that the bases are the same. In fact, the bases are different. \n$9^{18n}=3^{72}$, \nor equivalently, \n$9^{18n}=(3^2)^{72}$.\nUsing the rule $(a^m)^n=a^{mn}$, we can further simplify to $9^{18n}=3^{144}$.\nSince the bases are different, we cannot simply set the exponents equal to each other.

Dividing both sides by 36, we find that $n=\\boxed{2}$.",
        "\nFirst, we can rewrite $9$ and $27$ as powers of $3$: $9=3^2$ and $27=3^3$.\nThen, we can rewrite the equation as $(3^2)^{18n}=(3^3)^{24}$.\nUsing the property $a^{mn}=(a^m)^n$, we have $3^{36n}=3^{72}$.\nSince the bases are equal, we can set the exponents equal to each other: $36n=72$.\nFinally, we can solve for $n$ by dividing both sides of the equation by $36$: $n=\\boxed{2}$.\nThe answer is: 2",
        " We can simplify the given equation by expressing both 9 and 27 in terms of a common base.\nSince 9 is a power of 3, we have $9^{18n} = (3^2)^{18n} = 3^{36n}$.\nSimilarly, since 27 is a power of 3, we have $27^{24} = (3^3)^{24} = 3^{72}$.\nTherefore, the given equation becomes $3^{36n} = 3^{72}$.\nIn order for two terms with the same base to be equal, their exponents must be equal.\nSo, we have $36n = 72$.\nDividing both sides by 36, we find $n = \\boxed{2}$.\nThe answer is: 2",
        " To find $n$, we need to simplify the equation $9^{18n} = 27^{24}$. Since $9=3^2$ and $27=3^3$, we can rewrite the equation as $(3^2)^{18n} = (3^3)^{24}$.\nNext, we'll simplify the equation by applying the exponent rules. When we raise a power of a power to another power, we multiply the exponents. So, we have $3^{36n} = 3^{72}$. \nTo solve for $n$, we equate the exponents. Therefore, $36n = 72$. To find $n$, we divide both sides of the equation by 36.\nLet's calculate that. \n$36n \\div 36 = 72 \\div 36$\n$n = 2$\nFinally, we have found the value of $n$ to be 2."
