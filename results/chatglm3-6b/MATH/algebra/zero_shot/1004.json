The largest odd number less than $700$ is $699$.\nNow, we can find the number of odd integers in this range using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. The formula is:\n$$S = \\frac{n}{2}(a + l)$$\nwhere $S$ is the sum, $n$ is the number of terms, $a$ is the first term, and $l$ is the last term. In this case, $a = 501$, $l = 699$, and the common difference is $2$, since we are considering odd numbers.\nTo calculate $n$, we can subtract the first term from the last term and then divide by the common difference, and then add $1$ to include both endpoints:\n$$n = \\frac{699 - 501}{2} + 1 = 85 + 1 = 86$$\nNow we can plug all these values into the formula:\n$$S = \\frac{86}{2}(501 + 699)$$\n$$S = \\frac{86}{2}(1200)$$\n$$S = 43(1200)$$\n$$S = 5,264,000$$\nSo, the sum of all the odd integers between $500$ and $700$ is $5,264,000$.",
