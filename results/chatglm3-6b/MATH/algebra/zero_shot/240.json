        " $\\boxed{4}$\n#### Explanation: \nWe can solve this problem by evaluating the given expression step by step.\nFirst, we find the value of $\\sqrt{27}$. Since $\\sqrt{27} \\approx 5.384$, the smallest integer greater than or equal to $\\sqrt{27}$ is $6$. Therefore, $\\left\\lceil\\sqrt{27}\\right\\rceil = 6$.\nNext, we find the value of $\\sqrt{26}$. Since $\\sqrt{26} \\approx 5.136$, the largest integer less than or equal to $\\sqrt{26}$ is $5$. Therefore, $\\left\\lfloor\\sqrt{26}\\right\\rfloor = 5$.\nFinally, we calculate $\\left\\lceil\\sqrt{27}\\right\\rceil - \\left\\lfloor\\sqrt{26}\\right\\rfloor$: $6 - 5 = \\boxed{1}$.\nHowever, it seems like we made a mistake in our previous response. The correct answer is $\\boxed{4}$ rather than $1$ for $\\left\\lceil\\sqrt{27}\\right\\rceil - \\left\\lfloor\\sqrt{26}\\right\\rfloor$. Let's analyze the steps we took to reach this answer:\nStarting from the given expression $\\left\\lceil\\sqrt{27}\\right\\rceil - \\left\\lfloor\\sqrt{26}\\right\\rfloor$:\n1. Evaluate $\\sqrt{27}$ and find an integer that is greater than $\\sqrt{27}$. We found that $\\sqrt{27} \\approx 5.384$, and the smallest integer greater than or equal to $5.384$ is $6$. So, $\\left\\lceil\\sqrt{27}\\right\\rceil = 6$.\n2. Evaluate $\\sqrt{26}$ and find an integer that is less than or equal to $\\sqrt{26}$. We found that $\\sqrt{26} \\approx 5.136$, and the largest integer less than or equal to $5.136$ is $5$. So, $\\left\\lfloor\\sqrt{26}\\right\\rfloor = ",

Answer: \\boxed{1}.",
        " We can start by computing $\\sqrt{27}$. We know that $\\sqrt{25}=5$ and $\\sqrt{36}=6$, so $\\sqrt{27}$ must be between 5 and 6. The only integer that is larger than 5 and less than 6 is 6. Hence, $\\sqrt{27}=6$.\nNext, let's compute $\\sqrt{26}$. We can know that $5^2=25$ and $6^2=36$, so $\\sqrt{26}$ must be between 5 and 6. This time, 6 is the only integer that is larger than 5 and less than 6. Hence, $\\sqrt{26}=6$.\nNow we can evaluate the expression defined by the given instructions: $\\left\\lceil\\sqrt{27}\\right\\rceil - \\left\\lfloor\\sqrt{26}\\right\\rfloor$.\nSince $\\sqrt{27}=6$ and $\\sqrt{26}=6$, the expression becomes $6 - 6 = \\boxed{0}$.",
        " We first find $\\sqrt{27}$ and $\\sqrt{26}$, which are both between 5 and 6.\nSince $\\sqrt{27}=5\\sqrt{3}$ and $\\sqrt{26}=\\sqrt{6}$, we have $\\left\\lceil\\sqrt{27}\\right\\rceil=5$ and $\\left\\lfloor\\sqrt{26}\\right\\rfloor=2$.\nSo, $\\left\\lceil\\sqrt{27}\\right\\rceil - \\left\\lfloor\\sqrt{26}\\right\\rfloor = 5 - 2 = \\boxed{3}$.The answer is: 3",
        "\nTo evaluate $\\left\\lceil\\sqrt{27}\\right\\rceil - \\left\\lfloor\\sqrt{26}\\right\\rfloor$, we first need to find the square root of 27 and 26, and then take the ceiling of the square root of 27 and the floor of the square root of 26. \nThe square root of 27 is 5.477225577475675, which rounds to 5 when considering only the nearest integer.\nThe square root of 26 is approximately 4.828380022637291, which also rounds to 4 when considering only the nearest integer.\nFinally, the ceiling of 5.477225577475675 is 6, and the floor of 4.828380022637291 is 4.\nTherefore, $\\left\\lceil\\sqrt{27}\\right\\rceil - \\left\\lfloor\\sqrt{26}\\right\\rfloor = 6 - 4 = \\boxed{2}$.",
