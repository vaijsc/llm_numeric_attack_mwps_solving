Since $2\\%$ of $2000$ calories is equal to $40$ calories, we can set up the equation $\\frac{2}{100} \\cdot 2000 = 40$. Solving for the desired value, we find that $\\frac{2}{100} \\cdot 2000 = 40 \\Rightarrow 40 = \\boxed{40}$.",
        " To fulfill a person's daily caloric requirement, a healthy adult needs approximately $2000$ calories per day. This means that $40/0.02 = 2000$ tins of peaches will fulfill a person's daily caloric requirement.",
        " To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of calories needed to fulfill a person's daily caloric requirement.\nGiven:\n1. A snack-size tin of peaches has 40 calories.\n2. The tin represents 2% of a person's daily caloric requirement.\nLet's set up the equation:\nSnack-size tin of peaches = 2% of daily caloric requirement\n40 calories = 0.02 * daily caloric requirement\nTo solve for daily caloric requirement, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.02:\n40 calories / 0.02 = daily caloric requirement\n2000 calories = daily caloric requirement\nTherefore, a person's daily caloric requirement is 2000 calories.",
        " To find out how many calories fulfill a person's daily caloric requirement, we can set up a proportion.\nWe know that a snack-size tin of peaches has $40$ calories and is $2\\%$ of a person's daily caloric requirement.\nSo, we can set up the proportion:\n$\\frac{40 \\text{ calories}}{100 \\text{ percent}} = \\frac{x \\text{ calories}}{2000 \\text{ calories}}$\nWe can cross-multiply and solve for $x$:\n$40 \\cdot 2000 = 100 \\cdot x$\n$80000 = 100x$\n$x = \\frac{80000}{100}$\n$x = 800$\nTherefore, a 2000 calorie snack-size tin of peaches fulfills a person's daily caloric requirement.\nThe answer is: 2000"
