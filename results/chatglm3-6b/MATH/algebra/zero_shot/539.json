To do that, we need to find the value of $p$ and $c$ in the expression $c(g^2 + p)^2 + q$.\nFirst, let's factor out the common factor of $g^2$ from the expression $g^4 + 12g^2 + 9$. We can rewrite it as $g^4 + 12g^2 + 9 = g^2(g^2 + 12) + 9$.\nNow, let's recognize that the expression $g^2 + 12$ is the square of $g + 2$.\nTherefore, we can rewrite it as $c(g^2 + p)^2 + q$ where $p = 2$ and $c = 1$.\nNow, let's substitute these values back into the expression and simplify: \n$c(g^2 + p)^2 + q = 1(g^2 + 2)^2 + q = g^4 + 4g^2 + 4 + q$.\nFinally, let's rearrange the terms: \n$g^4 + 4g^2 + 4 + q = g^4 + 4g^2 + 9 - 5$.\nTherefore, $q = \\boxed{-5}$.\n\u535a\u968d\u7f24.__\n\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a",
