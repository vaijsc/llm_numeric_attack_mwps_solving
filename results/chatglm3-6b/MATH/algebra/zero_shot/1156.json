The coordinates of the endpoints are (-3, 7) and (2, -5). \nLet's calculate the distance between these two points using the distance formula:\nDistance = \u221a((x2 - x1)\u00b2 + (y2 - y1)\u00b2)\n= \u221a((2 - (-3))\u00b2 + (-5 - 7)\u00b2)\n= \u221a(5\u00b2 + (-12)\u00b2)\n= \u221a(25 + 144)\n= \u221a169\n= 13\nTherefore, the line segment has a length of 13 units.",
        " To find the length of the line segment whose endpoints have coordinates $(-3,7)$ and $(2,-5)$, we can use the distance formula. The distance formula is defined as $$d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$$where $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ are the coordinates of the endpoints of the line segment.\n### Explanation: In this case, the coordinates of the endpoints are $(-3,7)$ and $(2,-5)$. Substituting these into the distance formula, we have $$d = \\sqrt{(2 - (-3))^2 + (-5 - 7)^2}$$Simplifying this expression, we have:\n$$d = \\sqrt{(5)^2 + (-12)^2}$$\n$$d = \\sqrt{25 + 144}$$\n$$d = \\sqrt{169}$$\n$$d = 13$$\nTherefore, the line segment whose endpoints have coordinates $(-3,7)$ and $(2,-5)$ is $\\boxed{13}$ units long.\n### Answer: The answer is: 13",
