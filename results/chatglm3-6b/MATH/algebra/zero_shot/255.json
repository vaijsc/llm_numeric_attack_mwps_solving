Since the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular bisectors of each other, the side length between each vertex of the rhombus is $2\\sqrt{2}$.\nSo the coordinates of the vertices are $(2,0)$, $(2,2\\sqrt{2})$, $(-2,2\\sqrt{2})$, and $(-2,0)$.\nThe area of a rhombus is given by:\nArea = (diagonal 1 \\* diagonal 2) / ",
        " \nTo find the area of the polygon formed by connecting the $x$- and $y$-intercepts of the graph, we first need to identify these points. \nThe $x$-intercept occurs when $y=0$. Substituting $0$ for $y$ in the equation $y=f(x)$, we get $0=\\frac{(x-2)^2-9}{3}$. We can solve this equation by multiplying both sides by 3 and simplifying:\n\\begin{align*}\n0 &= (x-2)^2-9 \\\\\n0 &= (x-2)^2-6^2 \\\\\n0 &= (x-2)^2-36.\n\\end{align*}\nAfter simple division, we find that $x=2$. \nSimilarly, the $y$-intercept occurs when $x=0$. Substituting $0$ for $x$ in the equation $y=f(x)$, we get $y=f(0)$. Plugging in $0$ for $x$, we find that $y=f(0)=\\frac{(0-2)^2-9}{3}=\\frac{-1}{3}$. \nSo, the $x$-intercept is $(2,0)$ and the $y$-intercept is $(0, \\frac{-1}{3})$. \nThe vertices of the polygon formed by connecting these points are $(2,0)$, $(2,\\frac{-1}{3})$, and $(0,\\frac{-1}{3})$. \nThe area of a triangle can be found using the formula $\\text{Area}=\\frac{1}{2}bh$. In this case, the base is the vertical distance between the points $(2,0)$ and $(2,\\frac{-1}{3})$, which is $\\frac{ \\frac{-1}{3}-0}{2}= \\frac{-1}{6}$. The height is the horizontal distance between the points $(2,0)$ and $(0,\\frac{-1}{3})$, which is $2-0 = 2$. \nSo, the area of the polygon is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{-1}{6} \\cdot 2 = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$.",
        " To find the area of the polygon formed by connecting the $x$- and $y$-intercepts of the graph of $y=f(x)$, we need to find the coordinates of the intercepts.\nThe $x$-intercept occurs when $y=0$.

        " To start finding the area of the polygon formed by connecting the x -intercepts and the y-intercepts of the function, we first need to find where the function intersects the x-axis.\nSince $y = \\frac{(x-2)^2 - 9}{3}$, to find the x-intercepts, we set $y=0$.

Taking the reciprocal of both sides, we have $(x-2)^2 = 9$.\nTaking the square root of both sides and remembering that for every positive square root there is a corresponding negative value gives us $x-2 = \\pm 3$.\nSolving for $x$ gives us $x = 2\\pm 3$. Thus, the x-intercepts are $x = 5$ and $x = -1$.\nNow that we have the x-intercepts, we can find the y-intercept by plugging in $x=0$ into the function $f(x)$. substitute $x\\\u5411\u5de6\\\u4e50\u4e8e0$, we get $y = \\frac{(-2)^2-9}{3} = -5$.\nTherefore, the vertices of the polygon are $A(-1, -5)$, $B(5, 0)$, and $C(0, -5)$. We can draw these points on a coordinate plane and use the Shoelace Theorem to find the area of the polygon. Using the Shoelace Theorem, we have Area = $\\frac{1}{2} \\left|(-1)\\cdot 0 - (-5)\\cdot 5 + 0 \\cdot -5 - (-5)\\cdot (-1)\\right| = 21$. \nTherefore, the area of the polygon is $\\boxed{21}$.",
