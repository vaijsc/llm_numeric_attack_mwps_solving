The discount amount for a single ticket is $25\\%$ of $\\$20$, which is $\\frac{25}{100} \\cdot \\$20 = \\$5$. Therefore, the discounted price for each ticket is $\\$20 - \\$5 = \\$15$. Susan buys 4 tickets, so the total cost for her is $4 \\cdot \\$15$ = $\\$60$.\nFor Pam, she buys 5 tickets with a $30\\%$ discount. The discount amount for a single ticket is $30\\%$ of $\\$20$, which is $\\frac{30}{100} \\cdot \\$20 = \\$6$. Therefore, the discounted price for each ticket is $\\$20 - \\$6 = \\$14$. Pam buys 5 tickets, so the total cost for her is $5 \\cdot \\$14$ = $\\$70$.\nTo find out how many more dollars Pam pays than Susan, we subtract the total cost for Susan from the total cost for Pam: $70 - 60 = \\boxed{10}.$ So, Pam pays $10 more dollars than Susan.",

        "\nAt full price, one ticket costs $20. \nSusan buys 4 tickets, so all tickets together cost $4 \\times 20 = 80$. \nThe $25\\%$ discount means Susan reduces the price by $25\\%$ or $0.25 \\times 20 = 5$ dollars. \nSo Susan pays $80 - 5 = 75$ dollars.\nPam buys 5 tickets, so all tickets together cost $5 \\times 20 = 100$. \nThe $30\\%$ discount means Pam reduces the price by $30\\%$ or $0.30 \\times 20 = 6$ dollars. \nSo Pam pays $100 - 6 = 94$ dollars. \nTo find out how many more dollars Pam pays than Susan, we subtract Susan's payment from Pam's payment. \n$94 - 75 = 19$. \nSo Pam pays $19$ more dollars than Susan.",
