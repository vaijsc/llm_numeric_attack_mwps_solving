The equation of the parabola in vertex form is $y = -2x^2 + 4x + 1 = -2(x^2 - 2x) + 1$.\nCompleting the square, we add and subtract the square of half the coefficient of $x$, which is $(2/2)^2 = 1$. The new equation becomes $y = -2(x^2 - 2x + 1 - 1) + 1 = -2(x - 1)^2 + 1$.\nNo matter what values $a$, $b$, and $c$ are, the vertex form $y = a(x - h)^2 + k$ will match the given equation $y = ax^2 + bx + c$, so we can write the equation as a quadratic in vertex form, using vertex form $y = a(x - h)^2 + k$: \\[y = -2(x - 1)^2 + 1 = -2(x^2 - 2x + 1) + 1 = -2(x^2 - 2x + 1 - 1) + 1 = -2((x - 1)^2 - 1) + 1 = -2(x - 1)^2 + 2.\\]\nThus, we have $a = -2$, $b = 0$, and $c = 2$.\nFinally, $a + b + c = -2 + 0 + 2 = \\boxed{0}$.",

However, the graph of $y=ax^2+bx+c$ contains a vertex at $x=x_0$.  When $x=x_0$, $y_1 = y_2$.  From the graph, we can see that the vertex is at $(1,y_2) = (3,y_1)$.  Thus, $1=3$ and $a=3$.
