So, the total number of students is 9 times 4 which equals 36.\nStep 2: Determine the number of female teachers.\nThe ratio of teachers to students is 1 to 11. So, for every student, there is 1 teacher. Therefore, the number of female teachers is equal to the number of female students, which is 36.\nStep 3: Determine the number of female students.\nWe already know that the total number of students is 36, and the ratio of female students to the total number of students is 4 to 9. So, we can calculate the number of female students using 9 as the cross-multiplier: 4 x 9 = 36.\nStep 4: Determine the total number of students.\nSince the total number of students is given as 396, we can set up an equation using the given information: 36/4 + 396 = total number of students. Solving the equation, we find that the total number of students is 668.\nStep 5: Determine the number of teachers.\nUsing the ratio of teachers to students as 1 to 11, we can calculate the number of teachers by dividing the total number of students by 11: 668/11 = 62.\nTherefore, the number of teachers is 62.",
        "\nLet's start by determining the total number of students. We know that the ratio of female students to the total number of students is 4 to 9. This means that for every 4 female students there are a total of 9 students (including both female and male).\nIf we have 396 female students, we can set up the following proportion:\n4 female students / 9 students = 396 female students / x total students\nBy cross-multiplying, we can solve for the total number of students:\n4 * x = 9 * 396\n4x = 3564\nx = 3564 / 4\nx = 891\nSo there are 891 total students in the school.\nNext, we need to determine the number of teachers.

        "\nFirst, let's find the total number of female students.\nThe ratio of female students to the total number of students is 4 to 9.\nSo, if there are 9 parts in the ratio, there are 9/4 = 2.25 times as many students as there are female students.\nTherefore, the total number of female students can be expressed as:\n396 = 2.25 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 total number of female students = 2.25 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 total number of students.\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n396 = 2.25 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 total number of students --> total number of students = 396 / (2.25 \u00d7 9) = 396 / 20.25 = 192.\nNext, let's find the total number of students based on the given ratio of teachers to students.\nThe ratio of teachers to students is 1 to 11.\nSo, if there are 11 parts in the ratio, there are 11 times as many students as there are teachers.\nTherefore, the total number of students can be expressed as:\ntotal number of students = 11 \u00d7 total number of teachers = 11 \u00d7 total number of female students.\nSubstituting the value of total number of female students, we get:\ntotal number of students = 11 \u00d7 192 = 2008.\nNow, let's find the total number of teachers based on the total number of students.\nThe total number of teachers is equal to the total number of students divided by the ratio of teachers to students.\nSo, the total number of teachers is:\ntotal number of teachers = 2008 / 1 = 2008 teachers.\nTherefore, there are 2008 teachers in the school.",
