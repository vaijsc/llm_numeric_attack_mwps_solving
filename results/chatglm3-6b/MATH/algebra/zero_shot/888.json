        "\n#### Explanation:\nFor each rational function, there are three types of asymptotes:\n1. Asymptote at infinity (end behavior): This occurs when the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator. In this case, the numerator has a degree of 1 and the denominator has a degree of 2. Even though the degree of the numerator is not greater than the degree of the denominator, when the degree of the numerator is 1, the value of the function becomes arbitrarily small as $x$ approaches infinity. This indicates that there is a horizontal asymptote at $y=0$.\n2. Asymptote at $x=a$ ( vertical asymptote): This occurs when the degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 0. In this case, the numerator has a degree of 1, and the denominator has a degree of 0. There is a vertical asymptote at $x=a$.\n3. Asymptote at $x=b$ ( vertical asymptote): This occurs when the degree of the numerator is 0 and the degree of the denominator is 1. In this case, the numerator has a degree of 0, and the denominator has a degree of 1. There is a vertical asymptote at $x=b$.\nSince there is a horizontal asymptote at $y=0$, and there are vertical asymptotes at $x=a$ and $x=b$, we know that $a$ and $b$ must be the values that make the denominator zero. Thus, we can factor $x^2-5x-14$ as $(x-a)(x-b)$.\nWe can see that $f(x)=\\frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14}$ has a degree of 1 as both the numerator and denominator have a degree of 1. Since there is one more term in the numerator than in the denominator, there is also a slant or oblique asymptote, which is given by the quotient, divided by the linear function. Set the numerator equal to zero:\nquotient = $2x = 0$\nSo $f(x)\" role=\"presentation\" style=\"text-align: center; position: relative;\">",

Therefore, the function $f(x)$ has vertical asymptotes at $x = 7$ and $x = -2$. \nNext, we look at the horizontal asymptote. The horizontal asymptote occurs when $x$ approaches infinity or negative infinity. We divide the numerator and denominator by the highest power of $x$ in the denominator, which is $x^2$. This gives us the function $f(x) = \\frac{2}{x^2 - 5x -14}$. As $x$ approaches infinity or negative infinity, the term $x^2$ becomes very large. Thus, the fraction $\\frac{2}{x^2}$ approaches 0, and we can ignore it. The only relevant term is the constant term, which is $\\frac{2}{(x-5)^2-14}$.
