        " Okay, let's solve the problem step by step.\nFirst, let's assume the common difference of the arithmetic sequence is denoted by \"d\".\nGiven that the third term is equal to the second term minus the first term, we can say:\n3rd term = 2nd term - 1st term\nThis implies that the sum of the first three terms is:\n1st term + 2nd term + 3rd term = 1st term + d + (2d)\nThis can be written as:\n1st term + 3d = 3 times the 1st term\nThis can be written as:\n1st term + 3d = 3 times the 1st term\nThis can be written as:\n1st term + 3d = 3 times the 1st term + 2d\n(1st term) + 3d = 3 times the 1st term + 2d\nSubtracting (1st term) from both sides:\n3d = 2 times the 1st term\nTo find the value of the 1st term, we need to know the value of the common difference \"d\".
