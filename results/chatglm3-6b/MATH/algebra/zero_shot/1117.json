        "\nLet's call the two numbers x and y. We are given two pieces of information: \n1. The sum of the two numbers is 25: \n   x + y = 25\n2. The difference between the two numbers is 11: \n   x - y = 11\nWe need to find the smaller of the two numbers. Let's solve these equations to find the values of x and y.\nFirst, we can solve the second equation for y:\ny = x - 11\nNow, we can substitute this value of y into the first equation:\nx + (x - 11) = 25\nCombining like terms, we get:\n2x - 11 = 25\nAdding 11 to both sides:\n2x = 36\nFinally, dividing both sides by 2:\nx = 18\nNow that we have the value of x, we can find the value of y by substituting it back into the equation y = x - 11:\ny = 18 - 11\nCalculating:\ny = 7\nTherefore, the smaller of the two numbers is 7.",
        " Let's call the two numbers x and y.\nWe are given that the sum of the two numbers is 25, so we can write an equation to represent this:\nx + y = 25\nWe are also given that their difference is 11, so another equation can be written to represent this:\nx - y = 11\nNow we can solve the system of equations simultaneously. We can add the two equations together to eliminate the variable y:\n2x = 36\nDivide both sides by 2:\nx = 18\nNow we can substitute this value of x into either of the original equations to solve for y. Let's use the second equation:\n18 - y = 11\nSubtract 18 from both sides:\n-y = -7\nMultiply both sides by -1:\ny = 7\nTherefore, the smaller of the two numbers is 7.",
        " \nTo find the smaller number, we need to determine the difference between the two numbers. \nLet's assume the smaller number is x. \nThen, the larger number is 25 - x. \nAccording to the given information, the difference between the two numbers is 11. \nTherefore, 25 - x - x = 11. \nCombining like terms, we get 25 - 2x = 11. \nTo isolate x, we subtract 25 from both sides of the equation, resulting in -2x = -14. \nDividing both sides of the equation by -2, we find that x = 7. \nTherefore, the smaller number is 7. \n#### 7\nThe answer is: 7",
