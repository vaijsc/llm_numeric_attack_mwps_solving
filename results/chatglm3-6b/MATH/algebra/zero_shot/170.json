        " \nLet's start by finding the equation of the line $y = f(x)$ that passes through the point $(8,8)$.\nSince point $(8,8)$ lies on the graph of $y = \\frac{1}{4}f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}x\\right)$, we can use this information to find the equation of $y = f(x)$ that passes through the same point.\nThe equation $y = \\frac{1}{4}f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}x\\right)$ tells us that the $y$-coordinate of the point $(8,8)$ is equal to $\\frac{1}{4}$ multiplied by the $y$-coordinate of a point on the graph of $f(x)$.\nSince the $y$-coordinate of (8,8) is 8, we can set up the equation:\n$\\frac{1}{4} \\cdot y = f\\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 8\\right)$\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n$\\frac{1}{4} \\cdot y = f(4)$\nMultiplying both sides by 4, we get:\n$y = f(4)$\nSo the point $(8,8)$ also lies on the graph of $y = f(x)$.\nTo find the coordinates of this point, we substitute $x = 4$ in the equation $y = \\frac{1}{4}f(4)$.\nBy doing so, we get:\n$y = \\frac{1}{4}f(4) = \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{16}$\nSo the point on the graph of $y = f(x)$ corresponding to the graph of $y = \\frac{1}{4}f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}x\\right)$ is $(4, \\frac{1}{16})$.\nTo find the sum of the coordinates of this point, we add the $x$-coordinate and the $y$-coordinate:\n$4 + \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{64}{16} + \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{65}{16}$\n",
