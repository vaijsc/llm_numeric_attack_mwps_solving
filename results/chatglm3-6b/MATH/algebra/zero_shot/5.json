        " To find the 100th term of the arithmetic sequence, we need to know the common difference. In this case, it is 4. Therefore, we can find the 100th term by adding the common difference 4 \\* (100 - 1) = 4 \\* 99 = <<4\\*99=396>>396 to the first term. The answer is: 396",
        " To find the 100th term of an arithmetic sequence, we can use the formula:\nnth term = a + (n-1)d\nwhere n is the position of the term and a is the first term.\nIn this sequence, the first term a is 6 and the common difference d is 4.\nTherefore, the 100th term, T100, can be calculated as:\nT100 = 6 + (100-1)4\nT100 = 6 + 99 \\* 4\nT100 = 6 + 396\nT100 = 396\nSo the 100th term of the arithmetic sequence is 396.",
        " \nThe common difference in this arithmetic sequence can be found by subtracting any term from the following term.\nFor example, the common difference between the first and second term is 10 - 6 = 4.\nThe common difference between the second and third term is 14 - 10 = 4.\nTherefore, the common difference of this sequence is 4.\nTo find the nth term of an arithmetic sequence, we can use the formula: nth term = first term + (n - 1) * common difference.\nUsing the first term (a1 = 6) and common difference (d = 4), we can calculate the 100th term as follows:\n100th term = 6 + (100 - 1) * 4\n100th term = 6 + 99 * 4\n100th term = 6 + 396\n100th term = 396 + 6\n100th term = 402\nThe 100th term of the arithmetic sequence is 402.",
        " We can find the general form of an arithmetic sequence using the formula: a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d, where a_n is the nth term of the sequence, a_1 is the first term, n is the position in the sequence, and d is the common difference.\nIn this case, we can see that the first term a_1 is 6, the common difference d is 10 - 6 = 4, and we want to find the 100th term a_100.\nUsing the formula, we can substitute these values into the equation:\na_100 = 6 + (100-1)4\nSimplifying,\na_100 = 6 + 99 * 4\na_100 = 6 + 396\nTherefore, the 100th term of the arithmetic sequence is a_100 = 396. Possible answer: \\boxed{396}.",
        "\nThe given arithmetic sequence starts with a first term of 6 and common difference of 4. \nSo, to find the 100th term, we can start with the first term and keep adding the common difference until we get 100 terms.\nWe can calculate the number of terms by dividing the difference between the last term and the first term by the common difference and then adding 1:\n100 = (last term - first term) / common difference + 1\n100 = (last term - 6) / 4 + 1\n104 = last term - 6 + 1\nlast term = 104 + 6\nlast term = 110\nSo, the first 100 terms of the arithmetic sequence are: 6, 10, 14, 18, ..., 110.\nTherefore, the 100th term of the arithmetic sequence is 110.",
        " \nTo find the 100th term of the arithmetic sequence, we can use the formula:\nterm = first term + (n - 1) * common difference\n#### Step 2: Plug in the values\nIn this case, the first term is 6, the common difference is 4 (10 - 6 = 4, 14 - 10 = 4, ...), and n = 100.\nterm = 6 + (100 - 1) * 4\nterm = 6 + 99 * 4\nterm = 6 + 396\n#### Step 3: Calculate the Sum\nTo find the sum of all the terms in the arithmetic sequence, we can use the formula:\nsum = (n / 2) * (first term + last term)\nwhere n is the number of terms, first term is the first term in the sequence, and last term is the last term in the sequence."
