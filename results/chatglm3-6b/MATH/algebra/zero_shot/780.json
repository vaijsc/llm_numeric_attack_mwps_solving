        "\nThe midpoint of a line segment is the center of the segment, divided by 2. So, if the midpoint is (1,2) and one endpoint is (3,9), then the other endpoint must be 2(1,-2) = (2,-4). Therefore, the coordinates of the other endpoint are (-4,-4).\nThe answer is: -4",
        "\nCoordinates of the other endpoint are $(2-1, 2-2)$, which is $(1,0)$.\nSo the other endpoint is $(1,0)$ and the sum of the coordinates of the other endpoint is $1+0 = \\boxed{1}$.",
        " The endpoint $(a, b)$ has coordinates that are the $x$-coordinate of the midpoint $(mx, my)$ plus the $y$-coordinate of the midpoint minus the $x$-coordinate of the endpoint plus the $y$-coordinate of the endpoint (Since one endpoint and one banana are closer to midpoint.)$(a, b)$  has coordinates that are the $x$-coordinate of the midpoint $(1, 2)$ plus the $y$-coordinate of the midpoint minus the $x$-coordinate of the endpoint plus the $y$-coordinate of the endpoint   $(a, b)$  has coordinates that are  $2-3=-1$ and $2-9=-7$. So in total, $(a, b)$ has coordinates of $-1,-7$.\n",
        "\nSince the midpoint of the given line segment is $(1,2)$, the other endpoint must be 2 units to the left and 2 units above the midpoint in order to be symmetric with respect to the midpoint $(1,2)$.
