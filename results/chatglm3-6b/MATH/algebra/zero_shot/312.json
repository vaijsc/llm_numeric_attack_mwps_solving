    "solution": "We have two equations and two variables, so it's possible to solve for $a$ and $b$ directly and then calculate $a^2$ and $b^2$ separately to get our answer. However, doing so involves a fair amount of computation with complex numbers and square roots, so we look for an alternative approach. We square the second equation to get $(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = 25$, which is close to what we want but has the extra $2ab$ term. Since we know that $ab=7$, we can substitute to get $$a^2 + 2(7) +b^2 = 25 \\Longrightarrow a^2+b^2 = \\boxed{11}.$$",

        " We need to find the value of $a^2+b^2$. To do that, we can use the identity $(a+b)^2=a^2+2ab+b^2$. We can rearrange this equation to get $a^2+b^2=(a+b)^2-2ab=5^2-2(7)=25-14=\\boxed{11}$.",
        " \nWe square the equation $a + b = 5$ to get $(a + b)^2 = 5^2$. Expanding this gives $a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = 25$.\nSince we know that $ab = 7$, we can substitute this into the equation to get $a^2 + 2(7) + b^2 = 25$. Simplifying this gives $a^2 + b^2 = \\boxed{11}$.",
        " We are given that $ab=7$ and $a+b=5$.\nTo find the value of $a^2+b^2$, we can use the identity $a^2+b^2=(a+b)^2-2ab$.\nLet's substitute the given values into the identity:\n$a^2+b^2=(5)^2-2(7)=25-14=11$.\nTherefore, the value of $a^2+b^2$ is $\\boxed{11}$.",
        " To get $a^2 + b^2$, we can square the sum of $a$ and $b$. However, we know that $ab = 7$ and $a+b = 5$. Therefore, we can rewrite the expression as:\n$(a+b)^2 - 2ab = 5^2 - 2(7) = 25 - 14 = \\boxed{11}$.",
        " We know that $(a+b)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + 2ab$. \nFrom the given equations, we can substitute $a+b=5$ and $ab=7$ into the expression above:\n$(a+b)^2 = 5^2 = 25 \\Longrightarrow a^2 + b^2 + 2ab = 25$\nWe will now subtract $2ab$ from both sides to\u91cd\u91cd what remains:\n$ a^2 + b^2 = 25 - 2ab = 25 - 14 = 11$. \nTherefore, the value of $a^2 + b^2$ is $11$."
