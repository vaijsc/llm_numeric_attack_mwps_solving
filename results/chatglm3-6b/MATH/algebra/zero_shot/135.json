Since the equation of the parallel line will have the same slope, we can rewrite the equation in slope-intercept form, $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept. From the given equation $3x-7y=65$, we can isolate $y$ by dividing both sides by 7:\nNext Step: Divide all terms by 7 to isolate y.\ny = 3x - 65 / 7\ny = 3x - 9\nStep 2:\u5bf9\u6bd4\u65b0\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u65b9\u7a0b\u548c\u5f62\u5f0f y = mx + b, we can see that the slope is 3.\nStep 3: We will use the point-slope form of a line, which states that a line in the form $y-y_1=m(x-x_1)$, where $(x_1, y_1)$ is a point on the line and m is the slope. Therefore, plugging in the values (0, K) into the point-slope form, we get the equation of the line as:\ny - K = 3(x - 0)\ny - K = 3x\nStep 4: Since the line passes through the point $(7, 4)$, we can substitute these values into the equation to solve for K:\n4 - K = 3(7)",
