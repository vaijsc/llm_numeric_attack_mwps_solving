        "\nFirst, we can rewrite $4^{x-7}$ as $(2^2)^{x-7}=2^{2(x-7)}=2^{2x-14}$.\nSo, the equation $2^{x+1}=4^{x-7}$ becomes $2^{x+1}=2^{2x-14}$.\nSince the bases are the same, we can set the exponents equal to each other.\nTherefore, we have $x+1=2x-14$.\nSolving for $x$, we get $4x=15$.\nDividing both sides by 4, we find $x=3$.\nNow, we can rewrite $8^{3y}=16^{-y+13}$ as $(2^3)^{3y}=2^{-3y}+13$.\nSo, the equation $8^{3y}=16^{-y+13}$ becomes $2^{9y}=2^{-3y}+13$.\nAgain, since the bases are the same, we can set the exponents equal to each other.\nTherefore, we have $9y=-3y+13$.\nSolving for $y$, we get $12y=13$.\nDividing both sides by 12, we find $y=\\frac{13}{12}$.\nNow, we can find the value of $x+y$.\nSubstituting the values of $x$ and $y$ we found, we have $x+y=3+\\frac{13}{12}=\\boxed{\\frac{29}{12}}$.",
        "\nTo find the value of $x+y$, we need to solve the two equations.\nFrom the first equation, we have $2^{x+1} = 4^{x-7}$. We can rewrite $4$ as $2^2$, so the equation becomes $2^{x+1} = (2^2)^{x-7}$.\nUsing the property that $(a^b)^c = a^{b\\cdot c}$, we have $2^{x+1} = 2^{2(x-7)}$.\nSince the bases are the same, the exponents must be equal, so we have $x+1 = 2(x-7)$.\nSimplifying, we get $x+1 = 2x-14$.\nSolving for $x$, we find $x = 15$.\nNow, let's solve the second equation.\nFrom the second equation, we have $8^{3y} = 16^{-y+13}$.

        "\nWe'll start by simplifying each equation separately before finding the value of $x+y$.\nFrom $2^{x+1}=4^{x-7}$, we can rewrite $4^{x-7}$ as $(2^2)^{x-7}=2^{2(x-7)}$, and substitute it back into the equation to get $2^{x+1}=2^{2(x-7)}$. This implies that $x+1=2x-14$.  Subtracting $x$ from both sides gives $-1=x-14$, so $x=13$.\nNext, we'll simplify  $8^{3y}=16^{-y+13}$ to get  $(2^3)^{3y}=(2^4)^{-y+13}$ or $2^{3y}=2^{-4y+52}$. We subtract $2^{-4y+52}$ from both sides to get $2^{3y} + 2^{4y} - 52 = 0$. Factoring out $2^y=2\\cdot2^{-y}$, gives $2^y(2^y - 13) - 52 = 0$. Adding $13$ to both sides gives $2^y(2^y\u8d44\u6e90\u5171\u4eab) - 52 = 13$. Dividing by $2^y$, we get $2^y - 13 = 0$ which implies $2^y=13$, or $y= 4$\nFinally, we add $x+y$ which equals $13+4 = \\boxed{17}$.",
        "\nWhen written in terms of powers of 2, the given equations can be simplified as follows:\nSimplifying the first equation, we have $2^{x+1} = (2^2)^{x-7}$. By distributing the exponent of 2 into the parentheses, we get $2^{x+1} = 2^{2(x-7)}$.\nThis means that $x+1$ must equal $2(x-7)$. Expanding the right side using the exponent rule $a^b \\cdot a^c = a^{b+c}$, we get $2^{x+1} = 2^{2x-14}$.\nSince the bases are equal, the exponents must also be equal. Therefore, $x+1=2x-14$.\nSolving for $x$, we subtract $x$ from both sides and add 14 to both sides: $x=15$.\nSimplifying the second equation, we have $8^{3y} = (2^3)^{-y+13}$.

Therefore, $9y=-3y+13$.\nSolving for $y$, we add $3y$ to both sides and subtract $13$ from both sides: $12y=13$.\nSince we are asked for the value of $x+y$, we substitute the values we found for $x$ and $y$: $x+y = 15 + 2 = \\boxed{17}$.",
