We can use the information in the problem to create the following system of linear equations:  \\begin{align*}\n3a &= b \\\\\n3b &= c \\\\\n\\frac{2}{3}c &= d \\\\\na \\cdot b \\cdot c \\cdot d &= 162\n\\end{align*} We know that $b = 3a$. Also, $c = 3b$, so $c$ must equal $9a$. Then, $d = \\frac{2}{3}c$, so $d = 6a$. Substituting these quantities into our product gives $a \\cdot 3a \\cdot 9a \\cdot 6a = 162,$ which simplifies to $162a^4 = 162,$ or $a^4 = 1,$ so $a = 1$. Given this value, we can find that $b = 3$, $c = 9$, and $d = 6$. Thus, the four children have $1 + 3 + 9 + 6 = \\boxed{19}$ coins all together.",
