    "solution": "We look at the $x$-intercept and the $y$-intercept. Since $y = -2(x - 9)$, at $x = 0,\\; y = 18$, and at $x = 9,\\; y = 0$, the $y$-intercept is $(0,18)$ and the $x$-intercept is $(9,0)$. In order to keep both $x$ and $y$ integral, we investigate further. Since the slope is $-2$, a negative integer, and $y$ must be a nonnegative integer, $x - 9$ must be a nonpositive integer. This means that all the integer $x$ values between 0 and $9$, inclusive are valid, since $x \\leq 9$ and so $x - 9 \\leq 0$. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{10}$ total lattice points.",

        " \nTo find the number of lattice points, we need to find the range of lattice points that the line $y = -2x + 18$ passes through.\nThe equation of the line is $y = -2x + 18$.  We can find the $x$-intercept by setting $y$ to 0 and solving with $x$.  For every integer value of $x$ between 0 and 9, inclusive, there exists the corresponding value of $y$. In other words there are $10$ points on the $x$-axis.\nTo find the $y$-intercept by setting $x$ to 0, we have $y = 18$.

        "\nWe can start by graphing the line $y = -2x + 18$. The graph of a line in slope-intercept form is given by $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the $y$-intercept.\nFor the given line, the slope is $-2$ and the $y$-intercept is $18$. Let's plot the line on a coordinate plane.\n[asy]\nimport graph;\nsize(400);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(.7));\nreal f(real x) {\n  return(-2*x + 18);\n}\ndraw(graph(f,-5,20),red);\ndraw((-5,-6)--(5,6),EndArrow);\ndraw((0,0)--(6,0),dashed);\ndraw((0,0)--(0,7),dashed);\nlabel(\"$6$\",(5,6),NE);\nlabel(\"$x$\",(6,0),SE);[/asy]\nFor each lattice point, we need to find the corresponding $x$-coordinate. Since $x \\geq 0$, the $x$-coordinate alone and without loss of generality, will be determined.\nWe can start with some basic counting.\nLet's look at the $x$-intercepts of the line:\nThe $x$-intercept occurs when $y = 0$. We can substitute in $y = 0$ into the equation to solve for $x$:\n$$\\begin{align*}\n0 &= -2x + 18 \\\\\n2x &= 18 \\\\\nx &= 9\n\\end{align*}$$\nTherefore, the $x$-intercept is $(9,0)$.\nWhen $y = 0$, the line simply passes through the $x$-intercept. So there is one $x$-intercept and one point the line passes through.\n\u6b63\u5f0f\u7b54\u6848\uff1aThe line $y = -2x + 18$ passes through $\\boxed{1}$ lattice point.",
        " To determine the number of lattice points the line $y = -2x + 18$ passes through, we need to find values of $x$ for which $y$ is also an integer. One way to do this is to plug in possible values for $x$ into the equation and see if $y$ is an integer.\nSince $x$ and $y$ are both nonnegative, we know that the line will not cross the $x$-axis. This means that the minimum and maximum $y$ values will be nonnegative, since the line is nonnegative for all $x$ values. Therefore, we don't have to worry about the intercepts.\nTo find $x$ values for which $y$ is an integer, we can set $y$ equal to a positive integer (since $(x,y)$ is a lattice point). Then $y = -2x + 18$ simplifies to $$2x = y -18.$$We can solve this equation by\u7684\u601d\u60f3: for $2x$, having integer coefficients and positive integer $y$, the maximum or minimum will be achieved when $y = 18-2x$.  Checking the two endpoints, we can determine that in this specific range that bashy Sharpee.\nSo whit the lower bound of $y=18-2x$\nvalues of $x$ will go from 0 to 9, with the corresponding values being 9, 7, 5, 3, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9.  Checking the upper bound of $y=4-2x$, we find that the maximum value will be $y=4$ counted, with $4$ being achieved when $x = 0$.  Thus overall there are $9-0+1=10$ lattice points.\nThis answers the question: \"If $x \\geq 0$ and $y \\geq 0$, how many lattice points does the line $y = -2x + 18$ pass through?\" Answer: $\\boxed{10}$.",
        "\nTo determine how many lattice points the line $y = -2x + 18$ passes through, we need to find the points where the line intersects with the coordinate grid. In other words, we need to find the values of $x$ and $y$ that are both integers.\nAn interesting observation is that for any $x$ value greater than or equal to 9, we have $y = -2x+18 = -2(9) + 18 = 0, -2(8) + 18 = 4, -2(7) + 18 = 1, \\ldots$\nThis shows that the line will intersect the coordinate grid at the points $(9,18), (8,16), (7,14), \\ldots, (1,0)$. To make it easier to count, we can rewrite these points in slope-intercept form, where $y = mx + b$. \nWe can see that the slope m is -2 for all the points except the last one, where it is 0. So, we have $(9, 18)$, $(8, 16)$, $(7, 14)$, $\\ldots, (1, 0)$, which together have a common slope of $-2$.\nTherefore, the final point we want is $(1-2(-2)+18, 0)$. This gives us $1+18 = 19$. Hence, there are $\\boxed{19}$ lattice points that the line $y = -2x + 18$ passes through.",
        " We can substitute $x=0$ into the equation $y = -2x + 18$ to determine the number of lattice points the line passes through. When $x=0$, the equation simplifies to $y = 18$. \nSince $y$ is an integer, there are an infinite number of lattice points that the line passes through when $x=0$. \nFurthermore, we can see that $\\{ (0,18), (1,16), (2,14), \\dots \\}$ are all the lattice points the line passes through when $x \\geq 0$. Since there are an infinite number of $x$ values in this range and each of them corresponds to a unique $(x,y)$ pair, our final answer is $\\boxed{\\infty}$."
