Since we don't know the exact value of $x$, we can't determine the exact value of $y$. Therefore, $f^{-1}(f^{-1}(6))$ is undefined without additional information.",
        "\nFirst, we need to find the inverse function $f^{-1}(x)$ by swapping $x$ and $f(x)$.\nGiven that $f(1)=2$, $f(2) = 6$, and $f(3)=5$, we can see that $f^{-1}(2)=1$, $f^{-1}(6)=3$, and $f^{-1}(5)=2$.\nNow, we need to find $f^{-1}(f^{-1}(6)) = f^{-1}(3)$.\nUsing the definition of the inverse function, we have $f^{-1}(3) = f^{-1}(f^{-1}(6)) = f^{-1}(2)$.\nWe know that $f^{-1}(2)=1$, so $f^{-1}(f^{-1}(6)) = f^{-1}(3) = \\boxed{1}$.\nThe answer is: 1",
        "\nSince $f(3) = 5 > f(2) = 6$, we know that $f^{-1}(6) = 3$.\nSince $f(1) = 2 < f(3) = 5$, we know that $f^{-1}(2) = 1$.\nTherefore, $f^{-1}(f^{-1}(6)) = f^{-1}(3) = 1$\nSo the answer is $\\boxed{1}$.",
        "\nWe know that $f(2)=6$, so $f^{-1}(6)=2$. \nBy definition, $f^{-1}(f(x))=x$. So, $f^{-1}(f^{-1}(6))=f^{-1}(2)$. \nWe are given that $f(1)=2$, so $f^{-1}(2)=1$. \nTherefore, $f^{-1}(f^{-1}(6))=f^{-1}(2)=\\boxed{1}$.",
        " 1. First, we solve for $f^{-1}(6)$. Since $f(2) = 6$, we can conclude that $f^{-1}(6) = 2$.\n2. Next, we solve for $f^{-1}(f^{-1}(6))$. Since $f^{-1}(f^{-1}(6))$ is equal to the inverse of $f^{-1}(6)$, which is 2, we can conclude that $f^{-1}(f^{-1}(6)) = 2$.\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{2}$."
