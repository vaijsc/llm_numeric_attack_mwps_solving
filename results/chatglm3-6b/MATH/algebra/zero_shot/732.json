Therefore, the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is 2.\nThe $y$-coordinate of the vertex is given by $k=4(2)^2+4(2)+1=16+8+1=25$. Therefore, the vertex is at the point $(2,25)$.",

The vertex of a quadratic function in the form $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ is given by $x = -\\frac{b}{2a}$. Since the vertex is the point where $f(x)$ changes sign, we know that the $x$-coordinate of the vertex must lie in the interval $\\left( -\\infty, -2 \\right) \\cup \\left( 3, \\infty \\right)$.\nTherefore, we can set $-\\frac{b}{2a} = 3$ and solve for $b$: $--\\frac{b}{2a} = 3 \\Rightarrow b = -6$.\nSimilarly, we can set $-\\frac{b}{2a} = -2$ and solve for $b$: $--\\frac{b}{2a} = -2 \\Rightarrow b = 4$.\nSince $b$ can take on two different values, we need to check which one makes $f(x)$ positive only when $x \\in \\left( -\\infty, -2 \\right) \\cup \\left( 3, \\infty \\right)$.\nIf we assume $b = 6$, then the vertex of $f(x)$ is $x = -\\frac{b}{2a} = -1$.

Since we want the graph of $y=x^2+bx+c$ to be above the $x$-axis between $x\\in (-\\infty, -2)\\cup (3,\\infty)$, there are two cases we consider:\n1. $b>0$ and the quadratic expression factors as $(x+d)(x+e)$ with $d<0$ and $e>0$.\nIn this case, the inequality becomes $x^2+bx+c=(x+d)(x+e)>0$. Integration of this expression gives $-d+e+b<0+d+e+b$, which simplifies to $b>-2$. Thus, $b$ must be greater than -2 in order for $x^2+bx+c$ to be positive for $x\\in (-\\infty, -2)\\cup (3,\\infty)$.\n2. $b<0$ and the quadratic expression factors as $(x+d)(x+e)$ with $d<0$ and $e>-3$.\nIn this case, the inequality becomes $x^2+bx+c=(x+d)(x+e)>0$. Integration of this expression gives $-d-e+b+d+e+b<0+d+e+b+d+e-3+b+d+e-3+b$, which simplifies to $2b+d+e+3>0+d+e+3+b+d+e+3-3+b+d+e-3+b$.

For $(x+2)(x-3)$ to be positive, either $(x+2)$ and $(x-3)$ must be positive or negative.\nIn the case where $(x+2)$ and $(x-3)$ are both positive, the solution interval would be $(-2, 3)$. However, since there is no factor of $x-1$ or $x-2$ in $(x+2)(x-3)$, we can see that $x+2$* or $x-3 $ cannot simultaneously be negative. Therefore, $(x+2)$ and $(x-3)$ must both be positive at some possible point in the interval, and this positive gap would be $(-2,3)$.\nWe can also note that $(x+2)^2-4c$ or $(x-3)^2-4c$ handles the negative values between $-2$ and $3$.\nSo $(-2,3)$ must include $(-2,-1)$ and $(3,4)$ within the quadratic function.\nTherefore, the liquid intelligence expressions are $c=-1-2=-3$ and $c=4-4=0$. \nFinally, $b+c=c-(-3)=0-(-3)=\\boxed{3}$.",

We can find $f(-2)$ by substituting $x=-2$ into $x^2+bx+c$. Since the parabola opens upwards, we have:\n$f(-2) = (-2)^2 + b(-2) + c = 4 - 2b + c$\nSince we want $f(-2)$ to be less than zero,",

        "\n#### Explanation:\nA quick way to start on this question is to understand what happens when we graph $y = x^2$.\nWhen we graph that, we have a big peak at the origin, and as $x$ increases, $y$ increases at an increasing rate. That makes sense, because as $x$ increases, $x^2$ increases at an increasing rate. emphasizes that $Shrestha\\\u6276\u8d2b\u82f1\u8bed\"))",
        "\n1. Let's align the given quadratic function $x^2+bx+c$ with the equal signs so that we can develop the inequality.\n$$x^2+bx+c = 0$$\n2. Identify the roots of this quadratic equation $x^2+bx+c=0$ by factoring or using the quadratic formula, $x=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$. Since we're given that the roots are $-2$ and $3$, we can infer that negative and positive signs alternate in the expression inside the square root.\n3. Music to our ears! Given that the quadratic is positive in intervals $(-\\infty, -2)$ and $(3,\\infty)$, we know that the coefficient of $x^2$ is positive and the coefficient of $x$ is negative ($b<0$), which means that the parabola opens upward.\n reflection\n4.
