        " To find the cost of a pencil, we need to determine the cost of a jumbo eraser. We can do this by subtracting the cost of three pencils and the cost of five pencils from the two amounts combined.\nCost of 3 pencils + Cost of 1 jumbo eraser = $1.24 (Equation 1)\nCost of 5 pencils + Cost of 1 jumbo eraser = $1.82 (Equation 2)\nNow, let's solve for the cost of the jumbo eraser by subtracting Equation 1 from Equation 2:\nCost of 5 pencils + Cost of 1 jumbo eraser = Cost of 3 pencils + Cost of 1 jumbo eraser = $1.24 (Equation 2) - Cost of 3 pencils + Cost of 1 jumbo eraser = $1.82 (Equation 1)\nThe cost of 2 jumbo erasers = $2.32 - $1.24 = $1.08 or 108 cents\nSince the cost of a jumbo eraser is 108 cents, the cost of a jumbo eraser is 27 cents.\nNow, to find the cost of a pencil, we need to subtract the cost of the jumbo eraser from the cost of five pencils:\nCost of 5 pencils + Cost of 1 jumbo eraser = $1.82 (Equation 2)\nCost of 5 pencils + 27 cents = $1.82\nCost of 5 pencils = $1.82 - 27 cents = $1.55 or 155 cents\nFinally, to find the cost of a pencil, we subtract the cost of three pencils from the cost of five pencils:\nCost of 5 pencils - Cost of 3 pencils = 155 cents - 122 cents = 33 cents\nSo, the cost of a pencil is 33 cents.\n#### 33\nThe answer is: 33",

Since we know the cost of a jumbo eraser is constant at $j$ cents, we know the constant term will be the same in both equations.
