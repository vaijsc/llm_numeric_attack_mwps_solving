    "solution": "Though we can solve this by substitution, an easier way to solve the problem is to simply add the two equations. Then, $$ab + 5a + 2b = -10 \\Longrightarrow ab + 5a + 2b + 10 = 0.$$ This factors! Thus, $(a+2)(b+5) = 0$, from which it follows that at least one of the two statements $a = -2$, $b = -5$ is true. In the latter case, we obtain $a = \\boxed{2}$, which yields the largest possible value of $a$.",

        " To find the greatest possible value of $a$, we want to solve the given system of equations for $a$ and $b$.\nWe are given that $5a + 2b = 0$ and $ab = -10$.\nTo eliminate $b$, we can multiply the second equation by $5$ to get $5ab = -50$.\nAdding this equation to $5a + 2b = 0$, we eliminate $b$ and get $5ab + 5a = -50$.\nFactoring out a $5a$ and a $b$, and rearranging, we have $5a(b + 1) = -50$.\nDividing both sides by $b + 1$, we get $5a = \\frac{-50}{b + 1}$.\nNow we want to find the greatest possible value of $a$, which requires finding the greatest possible value of $\\frac{-50}{b + 1}$. \nTo find this value, we want to minimize $b + 1$. The minimum value occurs when $b + 1$ is equal to $0$, or $b = -1$.\nSubstituting $b = -1$ into the equation $ab = -10$, we have $(-1)(a) = -10$, which implies $a = 10$.\nTherefore, the greatest possible value of $a$ is $\\boxed{10}$.",
        " To find the greatest possible value of $a$, we first solve the\u7cfb\u7edf of equations.

Side note: $a = \\frac{-2b}{5}$ is the value we can express $a$ in terms of $b$.\nNow, substitute this value of $a$ into the second equation in order to solve for $b$. We get $\\left(\\frac{-2b}{5}\\right)b = -10$. Multiplying both sides of the equation by 5 resolves the fraction: $-2b^2 = -50$. Divide both sides by $-2$ to isolate the equation: $b^2 = \\frac{50}{2} = 25$. Take the square root of both both sides to find: $b = \\pm 5$.\nNow we will substitute both values of $b$ into our expression for $a$ to find the corresponding values for $a$. When $b=5$, $a = \\frac{-2(5)}{5} = -2$. When $b = -5$, $a = \\frac{-2(-5)}{5} = 2$.\nWe see that the greatest possible value of $a$ is $\\boxed{2}$.",
