        " To find the sum of all integers $x$ for which $-30 \\leq x \\leq 26$, we need to add them up. From-30 to -26 inclusive, we add -30, -26, and -25 by hand. We will add -24, -23, and -22 on the other side and add -25, -24, and -23. Because this is an arithmetic series, we can use the formula for the sum when the first term is $-a$, the last term is $a$, and the common difference is $-1$: $\\frac{-a + a - 25}{-1} = \\frac{-30 + 26 - 26}{-1\u7ec8\u6b62}$.
