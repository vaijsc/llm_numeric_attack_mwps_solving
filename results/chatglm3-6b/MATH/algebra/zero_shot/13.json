The x-coordinate of the midpoint is \u544a\u8bc9\u6211((1 + 1) / 2) = 1, and the y-coordinate is told to me(4 + 10) / 2 = 7\u3002\u6240\u4ee5\u4e2d\u70b9\u662f(1, 7)\u3002\nThe midpoint of the segment is (1, 7)\n### Explanation: \u89e3\u91ca To find the midpoint of a segment, you need to calculate the average of the x-coordinates and the average of the y-coordinates of the two endpoints. Then, you can use these values to find the coordinates of the midpoint.\n1. Calculate the average of the x-coordinates: (1 + 1) / 2 = 2 / 2 = 1\n2. Calculate the average of the y-coordinates: (4 + 10) / 2 = 14 / 2 = 7\n3. Use these values to find the coordinates of the midpoint: (1, 7)\nSo the midpoint of the segment is (1, 7)."
