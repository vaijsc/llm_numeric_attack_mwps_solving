        "To find the cost of one pencil, we can break down the problem step by step.\n1. **Find the cost of one pen**:\n   We know that seven pens cost $9.24. To find the cost of one pen, we can divide the total cost by the number of pens:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of one pen} = \\frac{9.24}{7}\n   \\]\n   Performing the division:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of one pen} = 1.32 \\text{ (in dollars)}\n   \\]\n2. **Find the total cost of three pens**:\n   Since eleven pencils cost as much as three pens, we need the cost of three pens. We simply multiply the cost of one pen by 3:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of three pens} = 3 \\times 1.32 = 3.96 \\text{ (in dollars)}\n   \\]\n3. **Relate the cost to pencils**:\n   We know now that the total cost of three pens is equal to the cost of eleven pencils:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of 11 pencils} = 3.96 \\text{ (in dollars)}\n   \\]\n4. **Find the cost of one pencil**:\n   To find the cost of one pencil, divide the total cost for eleven pencils by 11:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of one pencil} = \\frac{3.96}{11}\n   \\]\n   Performing the division:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of one pencil} \\approx 0.36 \\text{ (in dollars)}\n   \\]\n5. **Convert the cost to cents**:\n   Since we want the cost in cents, we multiply by 100 (as there are 100 cents in a dollar):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of one pencil in cents} = 0.36 \\times 100 = 36\n   \\]\nThus, the cost of one pencil is \\(\\boxed{36}\\) cents.",

So, the cost of three pens is also equal to $9.24.\nTo determine the cost of one pencil, we divide the cost of 11 pencils by 11.\n(Cost of three pens) \u00f7 (Number of pencils) = Cost of one pencil\n$9.24 \u00f7 11 = 0.84 \nNow, we convert the cost to cents:\n0.84 \\times 100 = 84 cents\nTherefore, the cost of one pencil is 84 cents.\nThe answer is: 84",
        " To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of one pencil in cents. We can do this by setting up an equation based on the given information.\n11 pencils cost as much as 3 pens. Let's represent the cost of one pencil as P cents and the cost of one pen as Q cents.\nFrom the given information, we can set up the following equation:\n11P = 3Q\nSince we know that 7 pens cost $9.24, we can determine the cost of one pen by dividing the total cost by 7:\nQ = 9.24/7 = $1.3143\nNow that we know the cost of one pen, we can substitute it into the equation to find the cost of one pencil:\n11P = 3(1.3143)\n11P = $3.9429\nTo find the cost of one pencil in cents, we divide both sides of the equation by 11:\nP = 3.9429/11\nP \u2248 0.356545455 cents\nTherefore, the cost of one pencil is approximately 356.54 cents.",
        " \nTo find the cost of one pencil in cents, we need to determine the total cost of 11 pencils and compare it to the cost of three pens.\nWe know that 11 pencils cost 11 divided by 11, which equals 1 unit of cost, or 1100 cents.\nWe also know that 3 pens cost 9.24 dollars, which we can convert to cents by multiplying by 100. So, In cents, that's 924 cents.\nTo find the cost of one pencil in cents, we can set up the equation:\n1100 cents = 924 cents + 196 cents\nCombining like terms, we find that:\n1100 cents = 1020 cents\nTo find the cost of one pencil, we subtract the cost of 1020 cents from 1100 cents.\nTherefore, the cost of one pencil is 1100 cents - 1020 cents = 80 cents.",
        " \nLet's call the cost of one pen $p$ cents and the cost of one pencil $c$ cents.\nWe're given that 7 pens cost $9.24$ cents, so $7p = 924$ cents.\nWe're also given that 11 pencils cost 3 times as much as 7 pens, so $11c = 3(7p)$.\nDividing the equation $7p = 924$ by 7, we get $p = 132$ cents.\nSubstituting this value into the second equation $11c = 3(7p)$, we get $11c = 3(7(132)) = 3(924) = 2772$ cents.\nDividing both sides of the equation by 11, we get $c = \\boxed{248}$ cents.\nThe answer is: 248"
