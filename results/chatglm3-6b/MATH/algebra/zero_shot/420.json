Thus, we set $Q(x)=0$ and solve for $x$.\nWe have $Q(x) = P(x)^2 = (4x^3 - 2x^2 + 7x - 1)^2$.\nTo simplify this further, let's expand the expression $(4x^3 - 2x^2 + 7x - 1)^2$.\nBy the binary expansion, we have:\n```\n$(4x^3 - 2x^2 + 7x - 1)^2 = (4x^3)^2(1-2x+x^2+7x-1) + 0$\n$4x^6- 16x^5+35x^4-8x^3 + 56x^2-16x+1$\n```\nThus, we have $Q(x) = 4x^6-16x^5+35x^4-8x^3+56x^2-16x+1$.\nNow, we need to find the value of $x$ when $y = 0$:\n```\n$Q(x) = 0$\n$4x^6-16x^5+35x^4-8x^3+56x^2-16x+1 = 0$\n```\nWe can see that this equation does not factor nicely, so let's try using synthetic division. We'll divide $4x^6-16x^5+35x^4-8x^3+56x^2-16x+1$ by $x^3+2x^2+x+2$.\n```\n          4x^3 - 2x^2 + 7x - 1 | 4x^6 - 16x^5 + 35x^4 - 8x^3 + 56x^2 - 16x + 1\n           ___________\nx^3 + 2x^2 + x + 2 | 4\n          | -16",
