(Solution: based on Solution 3, I just replaced the expression $q$ with the value of $p$ that we derived, and rephrased the answer as the final answer).",
        " \nLet\u2019s start by finding the value of $p$ and $q$ by solving the equation $\\frac{1}{p} + \\frac{1}{q} = 1$.\nMultiplying both sides by $pq$ gives $q + p = pq$.\nBy rearranging the equation to isolate $p$, we get $p = \\frac{q}{q-1}$.\nSubstituting this value of $p$ into the equation $\\frac{1}{p} + \\frac{1}{q} = 1$ gives $\\frac{q}{q-1} + \\frac{1}{q} = 1$.\nCombining the fractions on the left side gives $\\frac{q^2 - q + q - 1}{q(q-1)} = 1$.\nSimplifying the numerator gives $\\frac{q-1}{q(q-1)} = 1$.\nMultiplying both sides by $q(q-1)$ gives $q-1 = q(q-1)$.\nExpanding the right side gives $q-1 = q^2 - q$.\nRearranging the equation to isolate $q^2$ gives $q^2 - q - 1 = 0$.\nThis quadratic equation should be factorable, so we will try to factor it.\nSince $q > 1$, we know that $q$ is positive, so the equation has no real roots.\nTherefore, there is no valid value of $q$ to satisfy the equation and find a value of $(p-1)(q-1)$.\nHence, the answer is undefined.",
        " \nTo solve this question, we need to find the value of $(p-1)(q-1)$ given that $\\frac{1}{p} + \\frac{1}{q} = 1$.\nFirst, let's inconveniently point out that $p$ cannot be needed greater than $3$ because we are given that $q > 1$. So we must have $p < 3$.\nThen set $r = \\frac{1}{p} + \\frac{1}{q}$ in order to solve for $r$.\nSimplifying the equation, we have $r = \\frac{q+p}{pq}$.\nNow we are problem is asking to find the value of $(p-1)(q-1)$ using $r$.\nNotice that $r = 1$, just using 1 for $r$ can make this easier.5413709738825074\\frac{1}{p} + \\frac{1}{q} = 1$, then \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{p} &= 1 - \\frac{1}{q} \\\\\n&= \\frac{q-1}{q} \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{r-1}.\n\\end{align*} We now have the same number base for the right andle of the equation above, and since we are given $r = 1$, we have \\[1 = \\frac{1}{p-1},\\] so $p = \\frac{1}{1/p + 1/q} = \\frac{q}{1-1/q} = \\frac{q^2}{q-1}$. Thus $\\frac{1}{p-1} = \\frac{q-1}{q} = 1:\\url{1} = \\boxed{1}.$\n. The answer is 1",
        " Add $(p-1)(q-1)$ to both sides of $\\frac{1}{p} + \\frac{1}{q} = 1$.\n$$(p-1)(q-1) = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$$\n### Solution: Since $(p-1)(q-1) = 1$, the value of $(p-1)(q-1)$ is $\\boxed{1}$.",
        " To solve this problem, we can start by manipulating the given equation.\nFirst, subtract $\\frac{1}{p}$ from both sides to isolate $\\frac{1}{q}$ on one side of the equation: \\[\n\\frac{1}{q} = 1 - \\frac{1}{p}.\n\\]\nNext, multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of $\\frac{1}{q}$, which is $\\frac{p}{q}$: \\[\n\\frac{1}{p} = \\frac{p}{q} - 1.\n\\]\nNow, let's solve for $\\frac{p}{q}$. To do this, multiply both sides of the equation by $\\frac{p}{q}$: \\[\n\\frac{p}{q} - 1 = \\frac{p}{q} \\cdot \\frac{p}{q}.\n\\]\nCancel the $\\frac{p}{q}$ terms to obtain: \\[\np - q = p.\n\\]\nSimplify this equation by combining like terms: \\[\np - q = p \\implies q = 0 \\implies false.\n\\]\nIt appears that our initial assumption, that $q = 0$, contradicts the given condition that both $p$ and $q$ are greater than 1 and also that $\\frac{1}{p} + \\frac{1}{q} = 1$. This suggests that there is a logical error or inconsistency in the problem statement. \nHowever, we can verify if there was an error by considering the equation $\\frac{1}{p} + \\frac{1}{q} = 1$ with the condition $p > 1$ and $q > 1$ only.\nSolving this equation for $q$ gives: \\[\nq = \\frac{p}{1-p}.\n\\]\nNext, let's express $p$ in terms of $q$ using the equation $p + \\frac{1}{q} = 1$: \\[\np = 1 - \\frac{1}{q}.\n\\]\nNow, we can find the expression for $(p-1)(q-1)$: \\[\n(p-1)(q-1) = (1 -\\frac{1",
        " \nAlready provided in the question. Let's move on to the next step.\nLet's solve the equation $\\frac{1}{p} + \\frac{1}{q} = 1$ for $p$ in terms of $q$. \nFirst, let's find a common denominator on the left side of the equation, which is $pq$. \n$\\frac{1}{p} + \\frac{1}{q} = \\frac{q}{pq} + \\frac{p}{pq} = \\frac{p + q}{pq} = 1$\nNow, we can solve for $\\frac{p}{pq} = \\frac{1}{1}$, which means $p = \\frac{q}{q+1}$.\nTherefore, the value of the expression $(p-1)(q-1)$ can be calculated as follows:\n$(p-1)(q-1) = \\left(\\frac{q}{q+1}-1\\right) \\cdot (q-1) = \\frac{q(q+1)-(q+1)(q-1)}{q+1} = \\frac{q(q-q+1)-(q+1)(q-1)}{q+1} = \\frac{q-1-q^2+q}{q+1} = \\frac{q^2-2q+1}{q+1}$\nLet's simplify this expression further by factoring the numerator:\n$\\frac{q^2-2q+1}{q+1} = \\frac{(q-1)^2}{q+1}$\nTherefore, the value of $(p-1)(q-1)$ is $\\frac{(q-1)^2}{q+1}$.\nThe simplified expression is $\\boxed{\\frac{(q-1)^2}{q+1}}$.",
        "\nWe know that $\\frac{1}{p} + \\frac{1}{q} = 1$. \nMultiplying both sides by $pq$, we have $p + q = pq$.\nRearranging terms, we get $pq - p - q = 0$.\nAdding 1 to both sides, we have $pq - p - q + 1 = 1$.\nUsing Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick, we can rewrite this as $(p-1)(q-1) = 1$.\nTherefore, the value of $(p-1)(q-1)$ is $\\boxed{1}$.\nThe answer is: 1",
