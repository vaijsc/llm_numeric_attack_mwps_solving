        " \nWe can rewrite the equation as $m + n + 50 = 100$. Since we know that $m = 2n$, we can substitute $2n$ for $m$ in the last equation to get $2n + n + 50 = 100$. Combining like terms, we find $3n + 50 = 100$. Subtracting 50 from both sides gives $3n = 50$. Finally, dividing by 3 gives $n = \\boxed{16}\\frac{2}{3}$.",
