The denominator cannot be equal to zero, so we set $25-x^2 = 0$. This gives us $x^2 = 25$, which implies $x = \\pm 5$. Therefore, the possible values for $x$ are $-5$ and $5$.\nThe second term of the function is $\\sqrt{-(x-2)}$. The denominator cannot be equal to zero, so we set $x-2 = 0$. This gives us $x = 2$. Therefore, the possible values for $x$ are $2$.\nWe can select an interval that includes these values. Let's choose $x = -5$ and $x = 2$ to define the domain of the function. The interval of $x$ will be $[-5,2] - (-5+2) = [-5,2] - 3$. \nTherefore, the width of the domain of $h(x)$ is $2 - (-5 + 2) = 2 - (-3) = \\boxed{5}$.",

Thus, $x^2$ must be positive, which means $x$ must be either positive or negative.\nNext, let's consider the expression $\\sqrt{-(x-2)}$. For this expression to be defined, the denominator $-(x-2)$ cannot be zero. Thus, $x-2$ must be either positive or negative, but not zero. \nCombining these conditions, we find that $x$ can be either positive or negative, but not at 2. So the domain of $h(x)$ is $(-\\infty, -2) \\cup (-2, \\infty)$.\nTo find the width of this interval, we subtract the lower bound from the upper bound.
