        "\nWe can start by multiplying every term of the inequality by $2$ to get $-8 < 4x-8 < 16$.\nThis simplifies to $-8 < 4x-8 < 16$.\nNext, we can combine the right side of the inequality to get $-8 < 4x-8 + 16$.\nSimplifying this gives $-8 < 4x + 8$.\nFinally, we subtract $8$ from both sides of the inequality to find $-16 < 4x$.\nDividing both sides of the inequality by $4$ gives $-4 < x$.\nThus, the solution is $-4 < x < 0$.\nComparing this solution to the interval $a < x < b$, we find that $a = -4$ and $b = 0$.\nTherefore, $a + b = -4 + 0 = \\boxed{-4}$.",
        "\nWe will solve this problem by first eliminating the outer parentheses.\nFrom the inequality $-4 < 2(x - 1) < 8$, we distribute the $2$ on the left: $-4 < 2x-2$ < 8.\nNext, we can add $2$ to all sides of the inequality to isolate the linear term: $-2 < 2x$ < 10.\nDividing both sides of the inequality by $2$, we have $-1 < x$ < $5$.\nFinally, we add $1$ to both sides of the inequality to solve for $x$: $0 < x < 6$.\nThus, $a = 0$ and $b = 6$.\nTo find $a + b$, we add $0 + 6$ to get $a + b = \\boxed{6}$.",
        " \nTo solve the inequality $-4 < 2(x - 1) < 8$, we will rewrite it in two separate inequalities and solve them separately.\nFirst, let's solve $-4 < 2(x - 1)$:\n$2(x - 1) > -4$\nDividing both sides by 2:\n$x - 1 > -\\frac{4}{2}$\n$x - 1 > -2$\nAdding 1 to both sides:\n$x > -1$\nSo the value of $x$ in the first inequality is $x > -1$.\nNext, let's solve $2(x - 1) < 8$:\n$2(x - 1) > 8$\nDividing both sides by 2:\n$x - 1 > 4$\nAdding 1 to both sides:\n$x > 5$\nSo the value of $x$ in the second inequality is $x > 5$.\nTherefore, the solution to the inequality is $-1 < x < 5$.\nTo express the solution in the form $a < x < b$, we have $a = -1$ and $b = 5$.\nNow, let's find the value of $a + b$.\n$a + b = (-1) + 5 = 4$.\nSo, the value of $a + b$ is $\\boxed{4}$.",
        " 1. Multiplying each of the inequality signs by 2, we get $-8 < 4(x - 1) < 16$\n2. Expanding the inequality signs, we get $-8 < 4x - 4 < 16$\n3. Combining all the terms in one inequality, we get $-8 < 4x < 20$\n4. Dividing each term by 4, we get $-\\frac{16}{4} < x < \\frac{20}{4}$\n5. Simplifying, we get $-4 < x < 5$\nSo, $-4$ and $5$ are $a$ and $b$ respectively.\nTherefore, $a+b = -4 + 5 = \\boxed{1}$.",
        " \nTo solve this inequality, we can break it down into two separate inequalities. \nThe first inequality is $-4<2(x-1)$. We can distribute the 2, giving us $-4<2x-2$. \nNext, we add 2 to both sides to isolate the term with $x$. This gives us $-2<2x$. Dividing both sides by 2 gives us $-1<x$. \nThe second inequality is $2(x-1)<8$. We can distribute the 2, giving us $2x-2<8$. \nAdding 2 to both sides, we have $2x < 10$. Dividing both sides by 2 gives us $x<5$. \nCombining the two inequalities, we have $-1<x<5$. \nTherefore, the solution to $-4<2(x - 1)<8$ is expressed in the form $-1<x<5$. \nTo find the value of $a+b$, we add $-1$ and $5$. \nSo, $a+b = -1 + 5 = 4$.",
        "\nFirst, we simplify the given inequality: $-4 < 2(x - 1)$ means $-4 < 2x - 2$ and $2(x - 1) < 8$ means $2x - 2 < 8$.\nOn subtracting 2 from these inequalities, we get $-6 < 2x$ and $-4 < 2x$, respectively.\nDividing the second inequality by 2, we get $-2 < x$.\nAdding 6 to the first inequality, we get $0 < 2x$.\nDividing both sides by 2, we get $0 < x$.\nTherefore, $x$ can be any number greater than 0.\nThe inequality $a < x < b$ can be expressed as $0 < x < b$.\nTo find the values of $a$ and $b$, we simply need to determine them.\nSince $x$ can be any number greater than 0, let's choose that to be $b$.\nTherefore, $a = 0$ and $b = b$.\nThe value of $a + b$ is $0 + b$ or $b$.\nTherefore, $a + b$ will be equal to the value of $b$ since it is the variable we have chosen in the inequality.\n#### 0\nThe answer is: 0",
        "\nWe can rewrite the inequality as $-4 < 2x - 2 < 8$.\nAdding 2 to all parts of the inequality, we have $-2 < 2x < 10$.\nDividing all parts of the inequality by 2, we get $-1 < x < 5$.\nTherefore, the value of $a + b$ is $-1 + 5 = \\boxed{4}$."
