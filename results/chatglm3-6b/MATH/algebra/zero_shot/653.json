        "Let's denote the number of hours David worked as \\( d \\). Since Alan worked three times as many hours as David, we can denote the number of hours Alan worked as \\( 3d \\).\nBoth bricklayers place bricks at a rate of 30 bricks per hour. Thus, we can calculate the total number of bricks each bricklayer laid.\n**For David:**\nThe total number of bricks David laid:\n\\[\n\\text{Bricks laid by David} = 30 \\text{ bricks/hour} \\times d \\text{ hours} = 30d\n\\]\n**For Alan:**\nThe total number of bricks Alan laid:\n\\[\n\\text{Bricks laid by Alan} = 30 \\text{ bricks/hour} \\times 3d \\text{ hours} = 90d\n\\]\nNow, we know the total number of bricks laid by both Alan and David is 600 bricks:\n\\[\n30d + 90d = 600\n\\]\nCombining the terms:\n\\[\n120d = 600\n\\]\nNext, we solve for \\( d \\):\n\\[\nd = \\frac{600}{120} = 5\n\\]\nNow that we have determined how many hours David worked, we can find out how many bricks he laid:\n\\[\n\\text{Bricks laid by David} = 30d = 30 \\times 5 = 150\n\\]\nTherefore, the number of bricks David laid is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{150}\n\\]",

Since Alan worked three times as many hours as David, Alan worked \\( 3x \\) hours.\nNow, we know that both Alan and David can place 30 bricks per hour. Therefore, the number of bricks placed by each bricklayer can be calculated as follows:\n- David's brick placement:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Bricks placed by David} = 30 \\text{ bricks/hour} \\times x \\text{ hours} = 30x \\text{ bricks}\n  \\]\n- Alan's brick placement:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Bricks placed by Alan} = 30 \\text{ bricks/hour} \\times 3x \\text{ hours} = 90x \\text{ bricks}\n  \\]\nThe total number of bricks laid by both is 600.

Alan worked three times as many hours as David, so the total number of bricks Alan placed is 3 x 30 = 90\u00a0bricks.\nTogether, Alan and David place a total of 30 x (d + 3d) = 600\u00a0bricks.\nCombining like terms, we have 30d + 90 = 600.\nSubtracting 90 from both sides, we have 30d = 510.\nDividing both sides by 30, we have d = <<510/30=17>>17 hours.\nTherefore, David laid 30 x 17 = <<30*17=510>>510 bricks. Answer: \\boxed{510}.",
        "\nLet's represent the number of hours David worked as d and the number of hours Alan worked as 3d, since Alan worked three times as many hours as David.\nWe know that Alan placed 30 bricks per hour, so in d hours, he would have placed 30d bricks.\nSimilarly, David placed 30b bricks in b hours.\nThe total number of bricks they placed is the sum of the number of bricks placed by Alan and David, which is 30d + 30b = 600.\nWe also know that the total number of hours they worked is the sum of the number of hours worked by Alan and David, which is d + 3d = 4d.\nSo we have the equation 4d = 300.\nLet's solve for d.\nDividing both sides of the equation by 4, we get d = 75.\nTherefore, David laid 75 hours.\nSince Alan worked three times as many hours as David, Alan worked 3 * 75 = 225 hours.\nSince Alan placement rate is 30 bricks per hour, David placed 75 * 30 = 2250 bricks.\n#### 2250\nThe answer is: 2250",
        "\nLet's assume David worked x hours. \nSince Alan worked three times as many hours as David, Alan worked 3x hours. \nTogether, they placed a total of 600 bricks. \nSo, in x hours, David laid 30x bricks. \nAnd in 3x hours, Alan laid 30(3x) = 90x bricks. \nThe total number of bricks laid by both of them is 30x + 90x = 120x. \nWe know the total number of bricks laid is 600, so 120x = 600. \nDividing both sides of the equation by 120 gives us x = 5. \nTherefore, David laid 30 * 5 = 150 bricks. \n#### 150\nThe answer is: 150",
        "\nLet's say David worked x hours. Alan worked 3x hours.\nThe total number of bricks laid by David is 30 * x = 30x\nThe total number of bricks laid by Alan is 30 * 3x = 90x\nThe total number of bricks laid by both of them is 30x + 90x = 120x\nWe know that the total number of bricks laid by both of them is 600.\nSo, 120x = 600\nDividing both sides of the equation by 120: x = 600 / 120 = 5\nTherefore, David laid 30 * 5 = 150 bricks.\n#### 150\nThe answer is: 150",
        " Let's say David laid x number of bricks. Since Alan worked three times as many hours as David, Alan worked 3x hours.\nAlan places 30 bricks per hour, so in 3x hours, he placed 30 * 3x = 90x bricks.\nThe total number of bricks placed by Alan and David is 90x + x = 600\nCombining like terms: 91x = 600\nDividing both sides of the equation by 91: x = 600 / 91 \u2248 6.56\nTherefore, David laid approximately 6.56 number of bricks.\nHowever, since we can't have a fraction of a brick, we need to round this number down to the nearest whole number.\nDavid laid 6 bricks.\n#### 6\nThe answer is: 6",
        "\nLet's say that David worked for x hours.\nSince Alan worked three times as many hours as David, Alan worked 3x hours.\nAlan places 30 bricks per hour, so in 3x hours, he placement is 30 * 3x = 90x bricks.\nDavid places 30 bricks per hour, so in x hours, he places 30 * x = 30x bricks.\nThe total number of bricks placed is 90x + 30x = 120x.\nThe two of them placed a total of 600 bricks, so 120x = 600.\nTo find x, we divide both sides of the equation by 120: x = 600 / 120 = 5.\nTherefore, David laid 30x = 30 * 5 = 150 bricks.\n#### 150\nThe answer is: 150",
        "\nLet's assume that David worked x hours. Alan worked three times as many hours as David, so Alan worked 3x hours. \nThe total number of bricks laid by David and Alan is the sum of the number of bricks laid by each. \nGiven that Alan and David each place 30 bricks per hour, we can calculate the total number of bricks laid by each. \nFor Alan, the total number of bricks laid is 3x * 30 = 90x. \nFor David, the total number of bricks laid is x * 30 = 30x. \nThe total number of bricks laid by David and Alan is 90x + 30x = 120x. \nWe are given that the total number of bricks laid is 600. \nSo, 120x = 600. \nTo solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 120. \nx =    600 / 120  = 5. \nTherefore, David laid 5 hours, and the number of bricks laid by David is 30 * 5 = 150 bricks.",

Alan, who worked three times as many hours as David, worked 3x hours.\nThe total number of bricks placed by both Alan and David is given as 600.\nFrom the given information, we can write the following equation:\n3x + 3(3x) = 600\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n3x + 9x = 600\n12x = 600\nDividing both sides by 12, we get:\nx = 50\nTherefore, David worked for 50 hours.\nSince each of them places 30 bricks per hour, the number of bricks that David laid is:\n50 * 30 = 1500\nSo, David laid 1500 bricks."
