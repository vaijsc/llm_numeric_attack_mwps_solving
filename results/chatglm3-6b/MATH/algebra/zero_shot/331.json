Inside the square root, we have $\\sqrt{\\frac23} \\cdot \\frac{\\frac32}{\\frac32} = \\sqrt{\\frac23 \\cdot \\frac32} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\cdot 3}{3 \\cdot 2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac63}$.\n4. Simplifying the fraction inside the square root, we get $\\sqrt{\\frac63} = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{\\sqrt{3}}$.\n5. To rationalize the denominator, we will multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. In this case, it's $\\sqrt3$.\n6. Inside the square root, we have $\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{\\sqrt{3}} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt3}{\\sqrt3} = \\frac{\\sqrt{6 \\cdot 3}}{\\sqrt{3 \\cdot 3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{18}}{\\sqrt{9}}$.\nFinally, we simplify the fraction inside the square root:\n$\\frac{\\sqrt{18}}{\\sqrt{9}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{9 \\cdot 2}}{\\sqrt{9}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{1}$.\nSo, $\\sqrt{\\frac23} = \\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt2}{1}}$."
