        "\nFirst, let's find the common difference of the arithmetic series. We start with the first term 28 and subtract the second term, 28 - 20 = 8.

Substituting these values into the formula, we have $86 = 86 + (n-1)d$. Simplifying, we get $(n-1)d = 0$. Since $d$ cannot be zero, it follows that $n - 1 = 0$.
