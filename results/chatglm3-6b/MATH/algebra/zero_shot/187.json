        "\n1. Let's denote the weight of the smaller dogs as \"x\". So the weight of the smaller dogs combined is 2x.\n2. The combined weight of the three dogs is 185 pounds, so we have the equation: 2x + largest dog's weight = 185.\n3. The difference between the larger weight and the smaller weight is 20 pounds, so largest dog's weight - smaller dog's weight = 20.\n4. We can substitute 2x for the weight of the smaller dogs in the equation largest dog's weight - 2x = 20 to solve for the weight of the largest dog.\n5. Add 2x to both sides of the equation largest dog's weight = 20 + 2x to get the weight of the largest dog.\n6. Since the weights of the smaller dogs are the same, we only need to find the weight of one smaller dog and then double it to get the weight of the larger dog.\n7.

        "\nLet's assume $x$ is the weight of the smaller basset hound.\nSince there are two smaller dogs, the combined weight of both is $2x$.\nSo, the weight of the larger dog will be $185 - 2x$.\nThe difference between the larger weight and the smaller weight is $20$, which means:\n$185 - 2x - x = 20$\nCombining like terms, we get:\n$185 - 3x = 20$\nNow, let's solve for $x$:\nSubtract $185$ from both sides:\n$-3x = -165$\nDivide by $-3$:\n$x = 55$\nSo, each smaller dog weighs $55$ pounds.\nSince the difference between the larger weight and the smaller weight is $20$ pounds, the larger dog weighs:\n$185 - 2(55) = 185 - 110 = \\boxed{75}$ pounds.",
        "\nLet\u2019s say the weight of the smaller dogs is $x$ pounds. Then the weight of the larger dog is $185-2x$ pounds. We know that the difference between the larger weight and the smaller weight is $20$ pounds, so we can set up an equation: $185-2x-2x=20$. Simplifying this equation, we get $185-4x=20$, or $4x=165$. Dividing both sides by $4$, we find $x=41.25$. Since the weight of the smaller dogs is $x$ pounds, the weight of each smaller dog is $41.25$ pounds. Therefore, the weight of the largest dog is $185-2(41.25)=\\boxed{122.5}$ pounds.",
        "\nLet's assume the weight of the smaller dogs is \"x\" pounds.\nAccording to the information given, the larger dogs weigh x + 20 pounds.\nThe combined weight of the three dogs is x + x + 20 + 20 = 2x + 40 pounds.\nGiven that the combined weight of three basset hounds is 185 pounds, we can write the equation: 2x + 40 = 185.\nLet's solve for x:\nx = (185 - 40) / 2\nx = 145 / 2\nx = 72.5 pounds.\nSo, the weight of each smaller dog is 72.5 pounds.\nThe weight of the larger dogs is 72.5 + 20 = 92.5 pounds.\nTherefore, the weight of the largest dog is 92.5 pounds.\n#### 92.5\nThe answer is: 92.5",
        "\nLet's call the weight of the two smaller dogs \"x\" pounds, so the weight of the larger dog would be \"x + 20\" (since the difference between the larger and smaller weights is 20 pounds). The combined weight of all three dogs is $x+x+20+x+20=3x+40=185$. Let's solve for x:\n3x+40=185\n3x=185-40\n3x=145\nx=145/3\nx=45.\nSo the two smaller dogs weigh 45 pounds each. The largest dog weighs 45+20= 65 pounds.\nThe output is: 65",
        "\nFirst, we can use algebra to solve the problem. Let's let the weight of the smaller dogs be $x$, and the weight of the larger dog be $y$.\n### Step 1: Set up the mathematical equations.\nWe know that the combined weight of the three dogs is $185$ pounds, so we can set up the equation $(x) + (x) + y = 185$. Simplifying, we have $2x + y = 185$.\nThe difference between the larger weight and the smaller weight is $20$ pounds, so we can set up another equation $y - x = 20$.",
        "\nTo solve this problem, we can set up a few equations to represent the given information. Let's call the weight of one of the smaller dogs x. Since the two smaller dogs weigh the same, the combined weight of the two smaller dogs is 2x.\nAccording to the problem, the combined weight of all three dogs is 185 pounds, so we have the equation:\n3x + 2x = 185\nCombining like terms:\n5x = 185\nDividing both sides by 5:\nx = 37\nThe weight of one of the smaller dogs is 37 pounds.\nThe difference between the larger weight and the smaller weight is 20 pounds. Since one of the smaller dogs weighs 37 pounds, the weight of the larger dog is 37 + 20 = 57 pounds.\nTherefore, the weight of the largest dog is 57 pounds.\n### Answer:\nThe weight of the largest dog is 57 pounds.",
        "\nLet \"x\" be the weight of one of the smaller basset hounds.  Therefore the combined weight of the three basset hounds is 2x + 20.  We know the total weight of the basset hounds is $185,$ which gives the equation $2x + 20 = 185,$ or $2x = 165.$ Solving for x gives $x = 82.5.$ Therefore, the largest dog weighs $2(82.5) + 20 = \\boxed{205}$ pounds.",
        "\nLet's represent the weight of the smaller dogs as X pounds each. \nSo the weight of the larger dog is X + 20 pounds.\nThe combined weight of the three dogs is X + X + (X + 20) = 3X + 20 = 185. \nWe can subtract 20 from both sides of this equation to isolate the X terms.  \n3X = 185 - 20 = 165. \nDividing both sides by 3 gives us X = 55. \nSo the smaller dogs weigh 55 pounds each.\nTherefore, the weight of the larger dog is 55 + 20 = <<55+20=75>>75 pounds.

        "\nLet's assume the weight of the smaller dogs is X.  Then the weight of the larger dog is X + 20.  The combined weight of all three dogs is  X + X + (X + 20) = 3X + 20 = 185.  \nSince we know X is the weight of two smaller dogs that weigh the same, we can write X = 2Y (where Y is the weight of each of the smaller dogs).  Substituting X = 2Y into the first equation above gives  3Y + 20 = 185, and subtracting 20 from both sides gives  3Y = 165.  Dividing both sides by 3 gives  Y = 55.  Finally, substitution back into X = 2Y gives  X = 2(55) = 110.\nSubstitute X & Y back into the equation X + 20 = 185.
