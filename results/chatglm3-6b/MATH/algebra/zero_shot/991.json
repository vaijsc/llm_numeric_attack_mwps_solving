        " To find out what the answer is, we will first determine what the formula for the sum of 27 consecutive positive integers is.

Therefore, the formula for the sum of 27 consecutive positive integers can be written as:\nsum = (27/2)(1 + x)\nWe are told that the sum is 3^7, so we can set up the equation:\n3^7 = (27/2)(1 + x)\nNow we can solve for x by subtracting (27/2)(1) from both sides of the equation:\n3^7 - (27/2)(1) = (27/2)(1 + x) - (27/2)(1)\n3^7 - 142/2 = 27/2x\n3^7 - 142/2 = 27x/2\nTo get rid of the fraction, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:\n2(3^7 - 142/2) = 27x\nNow, let\u2019s simplify the expression on the left side of the equation:\n2(3^7 - 71) = 27x\n2(2187 - 71) = 27x\n2(2116) = 27x\n4232 = 27x\nTo solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 27:\nx = 4232/27\nx = 160\nTherefore, the last term of the sequence of 27",
        " \nFirst, let's find the average of 27 consecutive positive integers. The average is simply the sum of all the integers divided by the number of integers, which in this case is $\\frac{3^{7}}{27}$. \nTo find the median, we need to arrange the integers in ascending order and find the middle number. Since there are 27 integers, the median will be the $\\frac{27 + 1}{2} = 14$th term. \nNow, let's determine the middle numbers for even and odd cases:\nCase 1: If there are 26 integers, the median will be the (26 + 1)th term, which is 27th term = $27^{th}$ term\n>balance = 27 schemes (1$Th$ term of the base case)\n>balance = 27\n>middle term = 1 + balance = 1 + 27 = 28$th term = $28^{th}$ term\nCase 2: If there are 28 integers, the median will be the (27 + 1)th term, which is the second-to-last term = 26th term\nNext, let's find the value of each term in ascending order.

So, we can write the equation as $27 = \\frac{27}{2}(a + l)$, which simplifies to $42 = 27(a + l)$.\nDividing by 27, we have $42/27 = a + l$, which simplifies to $14/9 = a + l$.\nSince we are looking for a median, we need the middle term, which is the fourth term.\nSince $a + l$ is equal to $14/9$, the middle term is equal to $14/9 - 1/2$, which simplifies to $7/9$.\nSo, the median of the sequence of 27 consecutive positive integers is $\\boxed{\\frac{7}{9}}$.\nThe answer is: \\frac{7}{9}",
