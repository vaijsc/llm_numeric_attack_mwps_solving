According to the information provided, the number of pages she read each subsequent day is half of the previous day's pages. Hence, the number of pages read over five days can be expressed as follows:\n- Day 1: \\( x \\)\n- Day 2: \\( \\frac{x}{2} \\)\n- Day 3: \\( \\frac{x}{4} \\)\n- Day 4: \\( \\frac{x}{8} \\)\n- Day 5: \\( \\frac{x}{16} \\)\nNow we can write an equation for the total number of pages read over the five days:\n\\[\nx + \\frac{x}{2} + \\frac{x}{4} + \\frac{x}{8} + \\frac{x}{16} = 248\n\\]\nTo simplify this equation, let's find a common denominator, which in this case is 16:\n\\[\nx + \\frac{8x}{16} + \\frac{4x}{16} + \\frac{2x}{16} + \\frac{x}{16}\n\\]\nNow we can combine these fractions:\n\\[\nx + \\frac{8x + 4x + 2x + x}{16} = 248\n\\]\n\\[\nx + \\frac{15x}{16} = 248\n\\]\nNext, let's convert \\( x \\) into a fraction with the same denominator:\n\\[\n\\frac{16x}{16} + \\frac{15x}{16} = 248\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{31x}{16} = 248\n\\]\nTo eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by 16:\n\\[\n31x = 248 \\times 16\n\\]\n\\[\n31x = 3968\n\\]\nNow, divide both sides by 31 to solve for \\( x \\):\n\\[\nx = \\frac{3968}{31}\n\\]\n\\[\nx = 128\n\\]\nThus, the number of pages Lara read on the first day is \\( \\boxed{128} \\).\nTo verify, we can calculate the number of pages she read each day:\n- Day 1: 128 pages\n- Day 2: \\( \\frac{128}{2} = 64 \\) pages\n- Day 3: \\( \\frac{64}{2} = 32 \\) pages\n- Day 4: \\( \\frac{32}{2} = 16 \\) pages\n- Day 5: \\( \\frac{16}{2} = 8 \\) pages\nNow, summing those up:\n\\[\n128 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 = 248\n\\]\nThis confirms our solution is correct.

        "\nSince Lara read 248 pages over 5 days, we can find out how many pages she read each day by dividing the total number of pages by 5:\n248 pages / 5 days = 49.6 pages per day (rounded to 2 decimal places)\nTo find Lara's reading on the first day, which was 5 days ago, we can multiply the number of pages she read each day by 2:\n49.6 pages/day \\* 2 days = 99.2 pages (rounded to 2 decimal places)\nSo, Lara read 99.2 pages on the first day. However, since the novel is 248 pages long and she read on the first day only half as many pages as the day before, we know that the first day she read half of the pages, which is 248 pages / 2 = 124 pages.\nTherefore, Lara read 124 pages on the first day.",
        "\nLet $x$ be the number of pages Lara read on the first day.\nThe next day, she read $\\frac{x}{2}$ pages.\nThe third day, she read $\\frac{x}{4}$ pages.\nThe fourth day, she read $\\frac{x}{8}$ pages.\nThe fifth day, she read $\\frac{x}{16}$ pages.\nThe total number of pages she read is $x + \\frac{x}{2} + \\frac{x}{4} + \\frac{x}{8} + \\frac{x}{16} = 248$.\nCombining like terms, we have $2x + 2x/2 + 2x/4 + 2x/8 + 2x/16 = 248$.\nSimplifying the left side, we have $2x + x/2 + x/4 + x/8 + x/16 = 248$.\nCombining like terms Again, $2(x + \\frac{x}{2} + \\frac{x}{4} + \\frac{x}{8} + \\frac{x}{16}) = 248$.\nSimplifying the left side, $2x + x + x/2 + x/4 + x/8 = 248$.\nCombining like terms, we have $4x + x/2 + x/4 + x/8 = 248$.\nCombining like terms, we have $\\frac{32x + 16x + 4x + 2x}{8} = 248$.\nCombining like terms, we have $\\frac{54x}{8} = 248$.\nDividing both sides by 54, we have $x = \\frac{248}{54}$.\nDividing by 54, we find that $x = 4$.\nTherefore, Lara read 4 pages on the first day.\n#### 4\nThe answer is: 4",
