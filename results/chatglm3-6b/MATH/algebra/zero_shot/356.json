Thus, $f(1) = 1 - 1 = 0$.\nTo find $f(2)$, we use the definition of $f(n)$ when $n \\le 1$. Thus, $f(2) = 2 - 1 = 1$.\nFinally, we find $f(0)+f(1)+f(2) = -1 + 0 + 1 = \\boxed{0}$.",
        "\nFirst, let's consider the first function definition.\n$f(n) = \\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{cl}\nn^3+2n-1 &\\text{ if }n>1, \\\\\nn-1 &\\text{ if }n \\le 1.\n\\end{array}\n\\right.$\nFor $n = 0$, we have $f(0) = 0 - 1 = -1$.\nFor $n = 1$, we have $f(1) = 1 - 1 = 0$.\nFor $n = 2$, we have $f(2) = 2^3 + 2(2) - 1 = 8 + 4 - 1 = 11$.",
        " Since $f(n) = n-1$ for $n \\le 1,$ the expression $f(0) + f(1) + f(2)$ equals $f(0) + f(1) + (f(2)-1).$\nSince $f(2) = 2 - 1 = 1,$ our expression equals $f(0) + f(1) + (1 - 1) = f(0) + f(1),$ or to be more explicit, $(a)(b) = a+b$ when $a = 1$ and $b=-2.$ Hence, our expression equals $f(0) + f(1) = \\boxed{3}.$\n(with MathMDL)\nOr, if you prefer, we have that $f(0) = 0^3 + 2 \\cdot 0 - 1 = -1,$ and $f(1) = 1^3 + 2 \\cdot 1 - 1 = 2.$ Hence, we have that\n$$\\begin{array}{r r l} f(0) &+ &f(1) &+ &f(2) \\\\ [-2.5ex] \\hline\n-1 &+ &2 &+ &1 \\\\ [0.5ex] &+ & & & \\\\[-2.5ex] \\hline\n\\boxed{3} & & & & \\\\ [-2ex] \\end{array}$$\n(with PMS)"
