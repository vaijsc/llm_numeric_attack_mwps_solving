        " Let's first represent the larger of the two consecutive even perfect squares as a variable, L. We'll determine its value over time.\n### Steps:\n1. Start with the expression for the smaller even perfect square, which is 2n^2, where n is a positive integer.\n2. The larger even perfect square is the smaller one plus the difference between two consecutive even perfect squares' positive difference.\n3. If we denote the difference between two consecutive even perfect squares as D, then the equation can be written as:\nL = 2n^2 + D   (where \"D = 268\")\n4. In other words, L = 2n^2 + 268.\n5. If we're given that D=268, then substitute it into the previous equation and solve for L.\nL = 2n^2 + 268\n6. Since L is the larger of the two squares, n should be the smaller integer that makes it true.\n7. Start by assuming the smallest possible value of n, which is 1. This will give us:\nL = 2*1^2 + 268\n8. If L is still not the perfect square, increment n by 1 and repeat the process until L is a perfect square.\n9. Once we find the value of n for which L = n^2, we can compute the value of L using the formula L = 2n^2 + 268.",

If you thought about this carefully, you would realize that 2^3 = 8, 3^3 = 27, 4^3 = 64, 5^3 = 125, 6^3 = 216, 7^3 = 343, 8^3 = 512, 9^3 = 729, and, indeed, 10^3 = 1000.

That cube has 8 squares.  So we are seeking 8 more of 2: $8 \\cdot 2 = 16$!  $16 \\cdot 2 = 32$, etc.  However, we are not here to find those numbers; we are here to find 268.
