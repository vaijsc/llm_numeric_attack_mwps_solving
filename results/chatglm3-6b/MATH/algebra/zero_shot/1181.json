        " Let $y = x$. We know that $y = \\frac{1}{2-\\frac{1}{y}}$.\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by $y(2-\\frac{1}{y})$ gives $y(2-\\frac{1}{y}) = y$.\nExpanding the left side gives $2y - 1 = y$.\nSubtracting $y$ from both sides gives $2 = 0$.\nSince $2\\neq 0$, the equation has no solution and the value of $x$ is $\\boxed{\\text{undefined}}$.",
        "\nLet $x = \\frac{1}{2-\\frac{1}{2-\\frac{1}{2-\\ldots}}}$.\nThis\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f means that we are dividing 1 by the number that we get by repeatedly subtracting 1/2 from 1.\nLet's represent the infinite division as an equation:\n$x = \\frac{1}{2 - \\frac{1}{2 - \\frac{1}{2 - \\ldots}}}$\nNotice that the division never actually stops, because the subtraction inside the fractional division is never completing to 0.\nTherefore, we can conclude that this expression is an indeterminate form, and its value cannot be expressed as a finite numerical value.",
        " \nWe can rewrite the expression as $x = \\frac{1}{2-\\frac{1}{x}}$.\nMultiplying both sides by $x(2-\\frac{1}{x}) = 2x - 1$, we have $x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0$.\nThis quadratic equation can be factored as $(x-1)^2 = 0$.\nSo, the only possible value for $x$ is $x=1$.\nTherefore, the numerical value of $x$ is $\\boxed{1}$.The answer is: 1",
