Adding 2 to both sides also gives us $x=18$. \nHowever, it is important to note that $x=18$ does not make $\\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4}$ equal to $16$.\u5669\u68a6\u8fd8\u6709\u4e00\u9053math question SA\u3002 \"You are given two positive integers $a$ and $b$. In one move, you and your friend can swap the values of $a$ and $b$. You want to make the sum of the two integers as large as possible. What is the maximum possible sum?\"\nTo solve this problem, we want to maximize the sum of two integers by swapping them.\nFirst, let's assume that $a$ is greater than $b$. If we swap $a$ and $b$, the new sum would be $b + a$. Since we want to maximize the sum, we want $a$ to be as large as possible. Therefore, we should swap $a$ and $b$ only if $b \\geq a$.\nIn this case, we have $x^2 - 4x + 4 = 16$. Let's expand and simplify the equation: $x^2 - 4x + 4 - 16 = 0$, which gives us $x^2 - 4x - 12 = 0$. \nTo solve this quadratic equation, we can use factoring, completing the square, or the quadratic formula.

Substituting $(x-2)^2$ into the equation $x^2 - 4x + 4 = 256$, we get $(x-2)^2 = 256$.\nTo solve for $x$, we take the square root of both sides: $x-2 = \\pm 16$.
