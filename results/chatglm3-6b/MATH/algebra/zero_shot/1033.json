To do this, we subtract 2.6 from $(2.6)x+3.6$ to get $2.6x+3.6-(2.6)=2.6x+1.6$. \nNow that we have the expression $(x+b)^2$, we can see that $b=1.6$ since $2.6x+1.6$ can be factored as $(x+1.6)^2$. \nTherefore, $(x+1.6)^2=2.6x+1.6$. \nNow we can rewrite the given quadratic as $(x+1.6)^2+3.6$. \nFinally, we can see that $b+c=1.6+3.6=\\boxed{5.2}$.",
