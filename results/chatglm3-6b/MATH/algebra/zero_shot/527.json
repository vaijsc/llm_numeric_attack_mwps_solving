    "solution": "Two side lengths are straightforward.  We have $AB = 15$ because the $y$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ are the same and their $x$-coordinates differ by 15.  Similarly, the $y$-coordinates of $B$ and $C$ differ by 8 and their $x$-coordinates are the same, so $BC = 8$.  We could either notice that $\\triangle ABC$ is right, or use the distance formula (i.e., the Pythagorean Theorem) to see that  \\[AC = \\sqrt{(9-(-6))^2 + (-2-6)^2} = \\sqrt{15^2 + (-8)^2} = 17.\\] So, the perimeter of $ABC$ is $15+8+17 = \\boxed{40}$.",

        " To form a polygon, we need to connect the three given points $A(-6,6), B(9,6)$ and $C(9,-2)$ with straight lines. Since these points are all on the same plane, we can draw line segments $AB, BC,$ and $CA$ to form a closed polygon.\nFirst, let's find the slope of the line segment $AB$. The slope of a line passing through two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by:\nslope = (y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)\nFor line segment $AB$, this would be:\nslope = (6 - 6) / (9 - (-6)) = 0 / 15 = 0\nSince the slope of $AB$ is 0, this means that the line segment $AB$ is vertical. This is because the y-coordinates of both points $A$ and $B$ are the same, which means that the line segment is parallel to the x-axis. Therefore, the distance from $A$ to $B$ is simply the x-coordinate difference between $A$ and $B$, which is 15.\nNext, let's find the slope of the line segment $BC$. We can submit the two points $B(9,6)$ and $C(9,-2)$ into the slope formula:\nslope = (6 - (-2)) / (9 - 9) = 8 / 0 = undefined\nSince the slope of $BC$ is undefined, this indicates that the line segment $BC$ is a vertical line. This is because the y-coordinates of both points $B$ and $C$ are the same, which means that the line segment is parallel to the y-axis. Hence, the distance from $B$ to $C$ is simply the y-coordinate difference between $B$ and $C$, which is 8.\nFinally, let's find the slope of the line segment $CA$. We can use the points $A(-6,6)$ and $C(9,-2)$:\nslope = (-2 - 6) / (9 - (-6)) = -8 / 15\nTherefore",

The distance formula tells us that the distance between $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by $\\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2}$.\nUsing this formula, the distance between $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is $\\sqrt{(9-(-6))^2 + (6-6)^2} = \\sqrt{65}$.\nSo, the distance between points $A$ and $B$ is $\\sqrt{65}$.\nNext, let's find the distance between points $A$ and $C$. Using the distance formula again, we get $\\sqrt{(9-(-6))^2 + (-2-6)^2} = \\sqrt{89}$.\nSo, the distance between points $A$ and $C$ is $\\sqrt{89}$.\nFinally, since we have a triangle with side lengths $\\sqrt{65}$, $\\sqrt{89}$, and $\\sqrt{2 \\cdot (\\sqrt{65}) \\cdot \\sqrt{89}}$, we can use Heron's formula to calculate the perimeter.\nHeron's formula states that the perimeter $P$ of a triangle with side lengths $a$, $b$, and $c$ is given by $P = \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}$, where $s$ is the semiperimeter of the triangle, calculated as $s = \\frac{a+b+c}{2}$.\nPlugging in the side lengths, we get $s = \\frac{\\sqrt{65} + \\sqrt{89} + \\sqrt{2 \\cdot (\\sqrt{65}) \\cdot \\sqrt{89}}}{2}$.\nSimplifying, we have $s = \\frac{\\sqrt{65} + \\sqrt{89} + \\sqrt{2 \\cdot \\sqrt{65} \\cdot \\sqrt{89}}}{2}$.\nThe final step is to calculate $P$, which is the perimeter of the triangle.\n$P = \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}$.\nPlugging in the side lengths, we",
        " To find the perimeter of the polygon, we need to find the lengths of all sides and then add them up.\nLet's start by finding the distance between points $A$ and $B$.\nThe distance formula is $\\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2}$.\nUsing this formula, the distance between $A$ and $B$ is $\\sqrt{(9-(-6))^2+(6-6)^2}=\\sqrt{15^2}=15$.\nNext, let's find the distance between points $B$ and $C$.\nThe distance between $B$ and $C$ is $\\sqrt{(9-9)^2+((-2)-6)^2}=\\sqrt{144+64}=\\sqrt{208}=4\\sqrt{13}$.\nFinally, let's find the distance between points $C$ and $A$.\nThe distance between $C$ and $A$ is $\\sqrt{(-6-9)^2+(6-(-2))^2}=\\sqrt{144+64}=\\sqrt{208}=4\\sqrt{13}$.\nTherefore, the perimeter of the polygon is $15+4\\sqrt{13}+4\\sqrt{13}=\\boxed{15+8\\sqrt{13}}$.\nThe answer is: 15+8\\sqrt{13}",
        " To find the perimeter of the polygon, we need to find the distances between each pair of points and add them up.\nThe distance formula between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by:\nDistance = \u221a((x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2)\nUsing this formula, let's find the distances between each pair of points:\n- Distance between A and B = \u221a((9-(-6))^2 + (6-6)^2) = \u221a(15^2 + 0^2) = \u221a15^2 = 15\n- Distance between A and C = \u221a((9-(-6))^2 + (-2-6)^2) = \u221a(15^2 + (-8)^2) = \u221a15^2 + 8^2 = 15 + 64 = 79\n- Distance between B and C = \u221a((9-9)^2 + (6-(-2))^2) = \u221a(0^2 + 8^2) = \u221a0 + 64 = 64\nNow, we can add up the distances:\nPerimeter = 15 + 79 + 64 = 168\nTherefore, the perimeter of the polygon is 168 units.",

Since we have all three vertices, we can find the length of each side and sum them up to find the perimeter. \nThe length of side $AC$ can be found using the distance formula: \n$$AC = \\sqrt{((-6)-(9))^2 + ((6)-(-2))^2}$$\n$$AC = \\sqrt{(-15)^2 + (8)^2}$$\n$$AC = \\sqrt{225 + 64}$$\n$$AC = \\sqrt{289}$$\n$$AC = 17$$\nSimilarly, the lengths of sides $AB$ and $BC$ can also be found using the distance formula: \n$$AB = \\sqrt{(9-(-6))^2 + (6-6)^2}$$\n$$AB = \\sqrt{(15)^2 + 0^2}$$\n$$AB = \\sqrt{225 + 0}$$\n$$AB = \\sqrt{225}$$\n$$AB = 15$$\nAnd \n$$BC = \\sqrt{(9-9)^2 + (-2-6)^2}$$\n$$BC = \\sqrt{0^2 + (-8)^2}$$\n$$BC = \\sqrt{64}$$\n$$BC = 8$$\nFinally, we can add up the lengths of all sides to find the perimeter: \n$$Perimeter = AC + AB + BC$$\n$$Perimeter = 17 + 15 + 8$$\n$$Perimeter = 30$$\nThe perimeter of the polygon is $30$."
