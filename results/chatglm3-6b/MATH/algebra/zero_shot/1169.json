        " \nFirst, we combine like terms.\n$(9x^2+3x+7)+(3x^2+7x^5+2)$\nUsing the distributive property, we add each term from the first expression to each term from the second expression.\n$9x^2 + 3x + 7 + 3x^2 + 7x^5 + 2$\nNext, we group together the $x^2$ terms and the $x$ terms, and the constant terms.\n$(9x^2 + 3x^2) + (7x^5) + (3x + 2 + 7)$\nNow, we simplify.\n$12x^2 + 7x^5 + 10x + 12$\nFinally, we express our answer in decreasing order of degree by grouping like terms together, to get $\\boxed{7x^5 + 12x^2 + 10x + 12}$.",
        "\nFrom stem to leaf, we'll collect the like terms:\n$(9x^2+3x+7)+(3x^2+7x^5+2)$\n$= ( 9x^2+3x+7) + ( 3x^2 + 7x^5+2)$\n$= 9x^2+3x+7 + 3x^2 + 7x^5+2$\n the $x^2$ terms combine as follows:\n$= 9x^2+3x^2 = 12x^2$\nand the constant terms combine as follows next:\n$= 7 + 2 = 9$\nSo, we can write the final answer as $12x^2 + 9$",
        "\nFirst, we need to expand and combine like terms, but generic term Must contain variables of the same degree as the highest variable in the polynomial.$\nDegree 5 term: \\ under the circumstances, this problem does not have a term ofDegree 5.\nDegree 4 term:\\ (from first polynomial); $9x^2$\nDegree 3 term:\\ (from second polynomial); $7x$\nSecond degree terms: There are no other terms with degree higher than 2.\nTo find the simplest form of the polynomial, we must add the highest degree term for each degree in the term, from top to bottom, together. While adding the like terms of each degree of the term, we need to have their variables have the same degree which is the maximum among that term\u2019s degree. The coefficient of the like term must be added together to find the coefficient of the sum of the terms of the same degree.\nThe resulting simplification of the original polynomial must be a polynomial of the highest degree possible, and each term has the\u6751\u6c11\u4eec required degree. To get the answer in a boxed format, add $-22x^5$ and $(16x)$\nTerms in sorted order of degree: $(7x+9x^2-22x^5)+(3x^2+16x)$\nFactor out the $3x^2$ from both addends: $(3x^2)(1-8x^2+23x)+(3x^2)(16x)$\nBoxed answer: $\\boxed{3x^2-8x^2+23x+16x^2}$\n### Answer:\n3x^2 - 8x^2 + 23x + 16x^2"
