        "\nIs there a specific method or rule that you would like to use for solving this equation? usually we use cross-multiplication, the quadratic formula, or even the quadratic formula. Since we can clear the fractions by multiplying both sides by the denominator $(x+1)$, we can use cross-multiplication. Multiplying the left side by $x+1$ gives $(x-9)(x+1) = 2(x+1)$. Expanding the left side gives $x^2 - 8 = 2x + 2$. Bringing all terms to one side gives $x^2 + 2x - 10 = 0$.

        " \nTo solve the equation $\\frac{x-9}{x+1}=2$, we need to get rid of the denominators. We can do this by multiplying both sides by the denominator. So we have $x-9=2(x+1)$\nNow let's distribute the 2 on the right side. This gives us $x-9=2x+2$.\nTo isolate x, we need to subtract the right side of the equation from both sides. We get $x-x-9-2=2x-2x-9-2$, which simplifies to $-9-11=-13$.\nTherefore, we can see that $-13=-13$, which means that the equation is true.\nNow that we have the solution for x, we can check it by plugging it back into the original equation: $\\frac{x-9}{x+1}=2$.\nSo if $x=3$, then $\\frac{3-9}{3+1}=2$. This equation is true.\nTherefore, the solution is x=3.",
        "\nTo solve the equation $\\frac{x-9}{x+1}=2$, we first get rid of the denominator by multiplying both sides by $x+1$, giving us $x-9=2(x+1)$.\nExpanding, we get $x-9=2x+2$. Next, we isolate the $x$ term and move all the terms to one side by subtracting $x$ and 2 from both sides, resulting in $-9-2=2x-x$. Solving for $x$ gives us $-11=x$.\nTherefore, the solution to the equation is $x=\\boxed{-11}$.\n\u96c6\u7fa4 \n### Solution:"
