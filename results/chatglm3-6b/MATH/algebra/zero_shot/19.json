That would mean the contain the same number of calories as 12 fluid ounces. 8 fluid ounces is to 8 fluid ounces as  in 8 fluid ounces. To find how many calories would be contained in a 12 fluid ounce bottle, we can set up a proportion.\nUsing the proportion, we can write:\n8 fluid ounces / 12 fluid ounces = 12 fluid ounces / x fluid ounces\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n8 fluid ounces * x fluid ounces = 12 fluid ounces * 12 fluid ounces\n8x = 144\nDividing both sides by 8, we find:\nx = 18\nTherefore, a 12 fluid ounce bottle would contain 18 * 12 = 216 calories.\nThe\u804c\u662f:\n12 fluid ounces contain 216 calories.",
