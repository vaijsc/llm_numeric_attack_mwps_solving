To find the ratio, we divide the number of students wearing red (11) by the total number of students in the class (24). \nRatio = 11/24 \n3. Now that we have the ratio, we can use it to estimate the number of students wearing red in the school. \nTo find the estimated number of students wearing red in the school, we multiply the ratio by the total number of students (480). \nEstimated number of students wearing red = (11/24) * 480 \nEstimated number of students wearing red = (5/3) * 480 \nEstimated number of students wearing red = (5 * 480) / 3 \nEstimated number of students wearing red = 1200/3 \nEstimated number of students wearing red = 400 \nSo, Angie estimates that 400 of the 480 students in her school are wearing red.",
        " To estimate the number of students wearing red in the school, we can set up a proportion.\nThe ratio of students wearing red in the class is $\\frac{11}{24}$.\nWe can set up the proportion $\\frac{11}{24}=\\frac{x}{480}$, where $x$ is the number of students wearing red in the school.\nTo solve for $x$, we can cross multiply: $24x=11\\cdot480$.\nDividing both sides by 24, we find that $x=190$.\nTherefore, Angie estimates that $\\boxed{190}$ students in the school are wearing red on Valentine's Day.The answer is: 190"
