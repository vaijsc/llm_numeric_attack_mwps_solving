        "\nThe expression $|a-b|+a+b$ can be rewritten as $|a-b|+b+a$.\nThe expression $|a-b|$ represents the distance between $a$ and $b$, and it\u2019s equal to $b-a$ if $a<b$, or $a-b$ if $a>b$.\nSince $a<b$, we have $|a-b|=b-a$.\nTherefore, the expression $|a-b|+a+b$ becomes $b-a+a+b$.\nWe can simplify this expression by combining like terms: $2b$.\nSo the answer is $\\boxed{2b}$.The answer is: 2b",
        "\nFirst, it's clear that $|a - b|$ is always greater than or equal to 0.\nNow we can simplify the expression $|a - b| + a + b$ for any values of $a$ and $b$ that satisfy $a < b$. Since $a < b$, we have $a < b < 0$. Blindly substituting\u888d prices, see\u5c1d\u5c1d, you might guess that $|a - b| = -b + a$ and $a + b < 0$. So, $2(a + b) = 0$, which means $a + b = 0$. This makes $|a - b| + a + b = |a - b| + 2(a + b) =  |a - b| + 2(-a - b) =  |a - b| - 2(a + b) =  |a - b| - 2\\cdot 0 = |a - b|$. Therefore, $|a - b| + a + b = a - b$. Answer: \\boxed{a - b}.",
        "\nFirst, we determine that $a<b.$ Then, we note that the expression $|a-b|$ is just the absolute value of the difference between $a$ and $b$, which is $|a-b|=|b-a|$. Thus, let $x=|a-b|$, and the expression becomes $x+a+b$. Since $a<b$, we know that $a$ is less than $b$, so $x$ is the difference between $b$ and $a$, which is $|b-a|$. Substituting this into the expression gives the final answer of $|x|+a+b$.\n### Solution:\nTherefore, the given expression becomes $|x|+a+b$. This means that $|x|=|b-a|$, so we have $|x|+a+b=|x|+a+b$. We can see here that the value is always true because the expression is equal to itself. Therefore, the value of $|a-b|+a+b$ is $\\boxed{\\text{any value}}$.",
        " \nFirst, we have $|a-b|.$ Since $a<b,$ we know that $a-b<0,$ so $|a-b|=-(a-b)=b-a.$\nNext, we add $a+b$ to $|a-b|.$ We can add the two expressions, as there is no loss of generality; the expression always evaluates to $(\"|a-b|\")+a+b$ whether $a<b$ or not.  Since $a+b$ is always nonnegative, the value of $|a-b|+a+b$ is just $|a-b|.$",
        "\nThe value of $|a-b|+a+b$ is the absolute value of $a-b$ plus $a$ and $b$. If $a < b$, then $a-b < 0$, so the absolute value $|a-b|$ simplifies to $-a+b$.

If $a$        is greater than $b$, then $a-b$ is positive and $2a$ will be greater than or equal to $2(b)$. If $a$ is less than $b$, then $a-b$ is negative, so $2a$ will be less than or equal to $2(b)$. Thus, it does not matter if $a$ is less than $b$ or not. $|a-b|=b-a$ implies that $|a-b|+a+b=b+a=(a+b)-(a-b)=b$.",

In this case, the reference value could be the origin $(0,0)$, the point $a=(0,a-a)$, or any $-a=-b$ value.\nWe could solve this problem without using calculus, just by manually testing reference values.\nTwo different ways to do this are shown below.\nMethod 1: Manual Testing of Reference Values\nWe can manually test reference values to find the sum $|a-b|+a+b$.\nIf we let $a=1$, we get $|1-b|+1+b = |1-b|+2$.
