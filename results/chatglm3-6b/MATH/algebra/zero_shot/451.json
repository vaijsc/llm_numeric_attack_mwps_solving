Therefore, we have $f(q(1)) = f(b + 1) = -3$. \nSince $f(x) = x - 3$, we can substitute $x = b + 1$ to find $f(b + 1) = b + 1 - 3 = b - 2$. \nSetting $f(b + 1) = -3$, we have $b - 2 = -3$. \nTo solve for $b$, we can add 2 to both sides of the equation to get $b = -3 + 2 = -1$. \nTherefore, $b = \\boxed{-1}$.",
        " We know that $f(x) = x - 3$ and $q(x) = bx + 1$.\nWe want to find the value of $b$ given that $f(q(1)) = -3$.\nFirst, let's evaluate $q(1)$. We substitute $1$ into $q(x)$, so $q(1) = b(1) + 1 = b + 1$.\nNext, let's substitute $q(1)$ into $f(x)$. We substitute $b + 1$ into $f(x)$, so $f(q(1)) = (b + 1) - 3 = b - 2$.\nWe are given that $f(q(1)) = -3$, so we can set up the equation $b - 2 = -3$.\nTo solve for $b$, we add $2$ to both sides of the equation, which gives us $b = -1$.\nTherefore, $b = \\boxed{-1}$.\nThe answer is: -1"
