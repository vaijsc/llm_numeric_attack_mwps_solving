To solve this equation, we'll express it as:\n$(a - 1)(a^2 + a + 1) = 0$\nNow we can solve for $a$. The equation becomes:\n$a(a^2 + a + 1) = 0$\nThis equation is true when $a = 0$ or $a = -1$. This means that the inverse function is Switching between $0$ and $-1$ when we expect to find an inverse.\nTherefore, $f^{-1}(x) = 0$ or $f^{-1}(x) = -1$.\nNow we can find $f(f^{-",
        " \nTo find $f(f^{-1}(2010))$, we first need to find the inverse function $f^{-1}(x)$.\nGiven that $f(x) = x^3 + 3x^2 + 3x + 1$, we can sw\u6df1\u7231\u9006\u51fa$y^3+3y^2+3y+1=2010$ \u89e3\u65b9\u7a0b\u5f97\u5230$y$\u7684\u503c\u3002\u73b0\u5728\u6240\u4ee5\u6211\u4eec\u5f97\u5230\u65b9\u7a0b$y^3 + 3y^2 + 3y + 1 = 2010$\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e2a\u65b9\u7a0b\u5de6\u8fb9\u7684\u6240\u6709\u9879\u51cf\u53bb2010\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u4e8e$y$\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u65b9\u7a0b\uff1a$y^3 + 3y^2 + 3y - 2009 = 0$\u3002\n\u63a5\u4e0b\u6765\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5173\u4e8e$y$\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u65b9\u7a0b\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\u6c42\u6839\u516c\u5f0f\u6216\u8005\u56e0\u5f0f\u5206\u89e3\u6765\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u65b9\u7a0b\u3002\u8fd9\u91cc\u6211\u4eec\u4f7f\u7528\u56e0\u5f0f\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u53ef\u4ee5\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u80a1\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u7cfb\u6570\u548c\u5e38\u6570\u9879\u53ef\u4ee5\u7ec4\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b8c\u5168\u5e73\u65b9\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u6211\u4eec\u5c1d\u8bd5\u5c06\u65b9\u7a0b\u62c6\u5206\u4e3a$y^3 + 2y^2 + y - (y^2 + 2y + 49)$\uff1a\n$y^3 + 2y^2 + y - (y^2 + 2y + 49) = y^3 + 2y^2 + y - y^2 - 2y - 49 = y^3 + y^2 - 2y - 49 \\\\\n= (y + 7)(y^2 - 7y + 72) = (y + 7)(y - 4)(y - 18)$\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u89e3\u662f\uff1a$y = -7, 4, 18$\u3002\n\u63a5\u4e0b\u6765\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u627e\u5230\u4f7f$y = -7, 4$\u7684$x$\u7684\u503c\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u65b9\u7a0b substitute $y$ king back into the original equation $x^3 + 3x^2 + 3x + 1 = 2010$ \u5f97\u5230\u3002\u5c06 $y = -7$ \u5e26\u56de\u5230\u65b9\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5f97\u5230\uff1a\n$x^3 + 3x^2 - 2x - 2003 = 0$\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u65b9\u7a0b\u6ca1\u6709\u6574\u6570\u89e3\u3002\u63a5\u4e0b\u6765\uff0c\u5c06 $y = 4"
