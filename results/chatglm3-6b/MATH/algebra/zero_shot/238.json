So, gaining a negative sign each time we divide by 10, we'd have -23.\n-23 divided by 10 gives us -2.3. Again, gaining a negative sign each time we divide by 10, we'd have -2.3.\n-2.3 divided by 10 gives us -0.23. This process repeats, alternating between adding and removing a negative sign according to the divisor, until we reach a single digit.\nFinally, we'll convert this single digit back to a negative sign if it's negative and positive otherwise. Since -0.23 is positive, we won't change it, giving us -0.23.\nSince 123/1001 < 1, we know that the original fraction is a improper fraction.\nSo, we'll convert the reduce fraction to a mixed number by\u4e25\u8c28\u610f\u4e49\u4e0a\u7684 long division.\nPerforming the long division, we get 1 23 2 3 | 1 001 00 01 0\nAs we go from left to right, we bring down the next digit from the original fraction, and divide it by the divisor. 0 divided by 1 is 0.
