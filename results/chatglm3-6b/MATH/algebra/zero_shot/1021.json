From the second equation $5y=15z$, we can divide both sides by 15 to get $y = 3z$.\nFinally, we can substitute the value of $y$ obtained from the second equation into the expression for $x$ obtained from the first equation to get $x = \\frac{3(3z)}{8}$.\nSimplifying this expression, we have $x = \\frac{9z}{8}$.\nFinally, we need to find the value of $\\frac{x}{z}$.
