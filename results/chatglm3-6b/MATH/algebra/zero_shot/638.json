        "\nTo calculate $42^2$, Emily uses the strategy of finding the value of $40^2$ and adding 164. We can start by finding the product of 40 and 40. \n$40 \\times 40 = 1600$\nSo, $40^2 = 1600$.\nTo find the value of $42^2$, Emily adds 164 to $40^2$:\n$1600 + 164 = 1764$\nSo, $42^2 = 1764$.\nNow it's time to find the number Emily subtracts from $40^2$ to calculate $38^2$. Since $38^2$ is smaller than $40^2$, we can use the difference of squares identity to find the value.\nIn general, $a^2 - b^2 = (a+b)(a-b)$.\nSo, we have $40^2 = (40+0)(40-0)$ and $38^2 = (38+0)(38-0)$.\nSince $42^2$ is the value we found earlier, we can substitute it into the identity:\n$1764 = (40+0)(40-0) + 164$\nSimplifying, we have:\n$1764 = 40 \\times 40 + 164$\n$1764 = 1600 + 164$\n$1764 = 1764$\nNow, let's find the subtractable number by subtracting $40^2$ from $42^2$:\n$1764 - 1600 = 164$\nSo, Emily subtracts 164 from $40^2$ to calculate $38^2$.

        "\nFirst, we calculate $40^2$, which is equal to $1600$. We can use the mental calculation or the formula $a^2 = a(a+b+c)$, where $a$ is the original number, $b$ is the number that is added, and $c$ is the number that is subtracted.\nSo, if $a = 40$, $b = 2$, and $c = 164$, then $40^2 = 1600 = 40(40+2-164)$.\nNext, we calculate $38^2$ using the formula. We know that $38^2 = 38(38+b)$. Since we want to find the number that Emily subtracts, we need to solve for $b$. Setting the expression equal to $42^2 = 42(42+d)$ (where $d$ is the number we need to find), we have $38(38+b) = 42(42+d)$.\nDividing both sides of the equation by $38$ gives $38+b = \\frac{42(42+d)}{38}$. We can simplify this expression and solve for $b$ by subtracting $38$ from both sides and multiplying by $38$: $38+b = 42+d$.\nFinally, we isolate $b$ by subtracting $38$ from both sides: $b = d+42-38 = d+4$.\nSo, Emily subtracts $4$ from $40^2$ to calculate $38^2$.
