        "To solve the problem, let\u2019s represent the three consecutive even integers. \nWe can denote the first even integer as \\( x \\).

We can set up the following equation based on this information:\n\\[\nx + (x + 2) + (x + 4) = 66\n\\]\nNow, let\u2019s simplify the left side of the equation:\n\\[\nx + x + 2 + x + 4 = 66\n\\]\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\\[\n3x + 6 = 66\n\\]\nNext, we need to isolate \\( x \\). We can start by subtracting 6 from both sides:\n\\[\n3x = 66 - 6\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n3x = 60\n\\]\nNow, we divide both sides by 3 to solve for \\( x \\):\n\\[\nx = \\frac{60}{3} = 20\n\\]\nThus, the smallest of the three consecutive even integers is \n\\[\n\\boxed{20}\n\\]\nTo make sure we are correct, let's check our work by finding the three integers and verifying their sum:\n1.
