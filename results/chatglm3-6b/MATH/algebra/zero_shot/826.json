        " \nTo find the distance between $M$ and $M'$, we can use the distance formula. The midpoint formula told us that $M$ was the average of $A$ and $B$, so the $x$-coordinate of $M$ is the average of the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$, and the $y$-coordinate of $M$ is the average of the $y$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$.\nSo, the $x$-coordinate of $M$ is $\\frac{a+c}{2}$, and the $y$-coordinate of $M$ is $\\frac{b+d}{2}$.  \nNow, let's find the coordinates of $A$ and $B$ after the movements. \n$A$ is moved vertically upwards 20 units and horizontally to the right 14 units. The new $y$-coordinate of $A$ will be $b+20$ and the new $x$-coordinate of $A$ will be $a+14$. \n$B$ is moved vertically downwards 4 units and horizontally to the left 2 units. The new $y$-coordinate of $B$ will be $d-4$ and the new $x$-coordinate of $B$ will be $c-2$. \nSince $M$ is the midpoint between $A$ and $B$, the new $x$-coordinate of $M'$ will be the average of the new $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$.  So, the new $x$-coordinate of $M'$ will be $\\frac{a+14+c-2}{2}$. \nThe new $y$-coordinate of $M'$ will be the average of the new $y$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$.  So, the new $y$-coordinate of $M'$ will be $\\frac{b+20+d-4}{2}$. \nNow we can use the distance formula to find $MM'$, the distance between $M$ and $M'$. The distance formula is $\\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2}$.  \nPlugging in the coordinates of $M",
        " First, let's find the coordinates of $A$, $B$, and $M$.\nGiven that $A(a, b)$ and $B(c, d)$ are the coordinates of the original points, and $M(m, n)$ is the midpoint, we can find $m$ and $n$ using the formulas for midpoint:\n $m = \\frac{a + c}{2}$\n $n = \\frac{b + d}{2}$\nSimilarly, according to the given information, after moving $A$, we have $A'=(a+14, b+20)$, and after moving $B$, we have $B'=(c-2, d-4)$.
