        " \n#### Explanation:\nGiven that the graph of the equation $y=ax^2+bx-6$ is completely below the $x$-axis, it means that the parabola opens upwards and has a minimum point. Since $a^2=49$, we know that $a=7$ or $a=-7$.\nTo find the maximum possible integral value of $b$, we need to determine the vertex form of the parabola, which is $y=a(x-h)^2+k$. Comparing the given equation with the vertex form, we can see that $h=-b/2a$ and $k=-(b^2)/(4a)$.\n#### Solution:\nSubstituting $a=7$ or $a=-7$ into the equation $h=-b/2a$, we get $h=b/14$ or $h=b/7$. \nSubstituting $a=7$ or $a=-7$ into the equation $k=-(b^2)/(4a)$, we get $k=-(b^2)/28$ or $k=-(b^2)/49$.\nSince $a$ cannot be negative, we ignore the case $a=-7$. Therefore, we need to determine the largest possible integral value of $b$ under the condition that the vertex is between the $x$-axis and the $y$-axis.\nIf the vertex is above the $x$-axis, it means that the parabola opens upwards. The parabola would cross the $x$-axis if $k > 0$. However, since $k$ is always negative in the vertex form, it means that the vertex lies\u5b8c\u5168\u5728$x$-\u8f74\u4e0b\u65b9\u3002\nNow, we consider the cases where the vertex is at the point $(c,k)$ for some integer $c$ and where $k$ is positive.\n#### Case 1: Vertex at $(c,k)$\nThe vertex form of the parabola is $y=7(x-c)^2+k$. To find the integer value of $c$, we consider the fixed point $(h,k)$ where $(h,k)$ lies on the parabola with $y=0$ and $h=c\u5947\u5999",
