We can set up a system of two equations to represent the given information, as follows:\n\n\\begin{align*}\ng &= 8a \\\\\ng-a &= 56 \\\\\n\\end{align*}In particular, the second equation represents the grandfather's age $a$ years ago, when Andrew was born. To solve for $a$, we need to eliminate $g$ from the equations above. Substituting the first equation into the second to eliminate $g$, we get that $8a-a=56$ or $a=8$.

        "Let's denote Andrew's current age as \\( A \\) and his grandfather's current age as \\( G \\).\nFrom the problem, we have two key pieces of information:\n1. Andrew's grandfather's age is eight times Andrew's age:\n   \\[\n   G = 8A\n   \\]\n2. Andrew's grandfather was 56 years old when Andrew was born. This means the age difference between Andrew and his grandfather is 56 years. Thus, we can express the grandfather's age in terms of Andrew's age:\n   \\[\n   G = A + 56\n   \\]\nNow we have two equations:\n1. \\( G = 8A \\)\n2. \\( G = A + 56 \\)\nSince both expressions equal \\( G \\), we can set them equal to each other:\n\\[\n8A = A + 56\n\\]\nNext, we solve for \\( A \\). First, subtract \\( A \\) from both sides:\n\\[\n8A - A = 56\n\\]\n\\[\n7A = 56\n\\]\nNow, divide both sides by 7:\n\\[\nA = \\frac{56}{7} = 8\n\\]\nThus, Andrew is currently \\( \\mathbf{8} \\) years old.\nTo find Andrew's grandfather's age, we can substitute \\( A \\) back into one of the equations:\n\\[\nG = 8A = 8 \\times 8 = 64\n\\]\nSo, Andrew's grandfather is \\( 64 \\) years old.\nTo summarize:\n- Andrew's current age \\( A = 8 \\) years.\n- His grandfather's current age is \\( 64 \\) years.\nThus, the answer is that Andrew is \\( \\boxed{8} \\) years old.",
