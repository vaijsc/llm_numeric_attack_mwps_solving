We can solve for $I_2$:\n\\[I_2=\\frac{40}{20}I_1=2I_1\\]\nSo, the new current is $2\\times 40 = \\boxed{80}$ amperes.\nThe answer is: 80",
        " We know the formula: V = IR. From this, we can rearrange to find I = V/R. In this problem, we are given V and R, and we want to find I. We can use the formula I = V/R to find I in terms of R.\u9065\u8fdc  R is given as 20 ohms, and V is given as 40 (in amperes) \\* 3 (in ohms) = 120 ohms. Plugging in these values, we get I = 120/20 = <<120/20=6>>6 amperes. Answer: \\boxed{6}.",
        " Let's use the formula Ohm's law states: V = IR. Then, we can write: I = V/R. Multiplying both sides by R, we get: I = V/R = (IR) / R = I_original / R_original.  So, if I_original = 40 amps, R_original = 3 ohms, and V remains constant while R becomes 20 ohms, we find: I = V/R = (40)/(3) = 13.33 amps. ",
        " Using Ohm's law, we know that the equation $V=IR$ relates the voltage $V$, current $I$, and resistance $R$. In the problem, we are provided with $V=40\\cdot3=120V$ when $I=40\\text{ amperes}$, and initially $R=3\\text{ ohms}$.  So, when $R=3\\text{ ohms}$, $I=\\frac{V}{R}=\\frac{120}{3}=\\boxed{40\\text{ amperes}}$.  When $R=20\\text{ ohms}$, we can see from the first equation (since we know the voltage is constant:  $V=IR$) that $I=\\frac{V}{R}=\\frac{120}{20}=\\boxed{6\\text{ amperes}}$.",
        " Given the equation $V=IR$, or $V$ is directly proportional to $I$, and since we assume that the voltage remains constant, $I$ is also directly proportional to $R$.\nTherefore, we can set up the equation $\\frac{I_1}{I_2}=\\frac{R_2}{R_1}$, where $I_1=40$ amperes, $R_1=3$ ohms, $I_2$ is the amount of current when the resistor has a resistance of $20$ ohms, and $R_2=20$ ohms.\nPlugging in the given values, we get $\\frac{40}{I_2}=\\frac{20}{3}$.\nTo solve for $I_2$, we cross multiply: $40\\cdot 3 = 20 \\cdot I_2$.\n$120 = 20 \\cdot I_2$.\n$I_2 = 6$.\nTherefore, the amount of current when the resistor has a resistance of $20$ ohms is $\\boxed{6}$ amperes.",
        " To find the amount of current (in amperes) when the resistor has a resistance of $20$ ohms, assuming voltage remains constant, we can rearrange Ohm's law formula: $V=IR$.\nFirst, let's find the total voltage ($V$) when the resistor has a resistance of $3$ ohms and $I=40$ amperes:\n$V = IR = (40 \\text{ amperes}) \\times (3 \\text{ ohms}) = 120 \\text{ volts}$\nNow, we can use this voltage and the new resistance of $20$ ohms to find the amount of current ($I$) using the formula $V=IR$.\n$I = \\frac{V}{R} = \\frac{120 \\text{ volts}}{20 \\text{ ohms}} = \\boxed{6 \\text{ amperes}}$\nSo, the amount of current when the resistor has a resistance of $20$ ohms is $6$ amperes.",
        " Since we are assume voltage remains constant, Ohm's law equation will not change and can be re-written as V = I * R.\n1. In the first scenario, R=3 and I=40. We can solve for V:\nV = I * R\nV = 40 * 3\nV = 120 Ohms\n2. In the next scenario, R=20. We can reapply Ohm's law to solve for I:\nV = I * R\n120 = I * 20\nI = 120 / 20\nI = 6 A (in amperes)\nTherefore, in the scenario where the resistor has a resistance of $20$ ohms, the amount of current running through it would be 6 A (amperes)."
