        "\nSince $\\frac25=40$, we can write $\\frac A{60}=40$.\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by 60, we find $A=2400$.\nSimilarly, since $\\frac25=40$, we can write $\\frac {60}B=40$.\nDividing both sides of the equation by 40, we find $B=60/40=3/2$.\nTherefore, $A+B=2400+3/2=\\boxed{2409}$. \nThe answer is: 2409",
        " Work backwards from $\\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{A}{60} = \\frac{60}{B}$. Cross multiplying, we have $2B = 60A$. Dividing by 2 gives $B = 30A$. Since $\\frac{2}{5}=\\frac{60}{B}$, it follows that $B = 10$ and $A = \\frac{2}{5} \\cdot\\frac{1}{30} = \\frac{1}{75}$. Therefore, $A + B = \\frac{1}{75} + 10 = \\frac{1}{75} + \\frac{750}{75} = \\boxed{\\frac{751}{75}}$.",
