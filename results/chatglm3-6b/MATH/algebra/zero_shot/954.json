The number of free throws Jenny made at the first practice is 3.\n#### 6. The answer is: 3",
        " Let's call the number of free throws Jenny made at the first practice F.\nAt the second practice, she made twice as many free throws as she made at the first practice, so she made 2F free throws.\nAt the third practice, she made twice as many free throws as she made at the second practice, so she made 2 * 2F = 4F free throws.\nAt the fourth practice, she made twice as many free throws as she made at the third practice, so she made 2 * 4F = 8F free throws.\nAt her fifth practice, she made 48 free throws, which is twice as many as she made at the fourth practice, so she made 2 * 8F = 16F free throws.\nSince we know this last number, we can set up an equation to solve for F, 16F = 48.\nDividing both sides of the equation by 16, we get F = 48 / 16 = 3.\nTherefore, Jenny made 3 free throws at her first practice.\n#### 3\nThe answer is: 3",
        " Let $x$ represent the number of free throws Jenny made at her first practice.\nAccording to the problem, at her fifth practice she made twice as many free throws as she made at her previous practice.\nSo, she made $2x$ free throws at her fifth practice.\nWe are given that she made 48 free throws at her fifth practice.\nSo, $2x = 48$.\nDividing both sides by 2, we get $x = 24$.\nTherefore, Jenny made $\\boxed{24}$ free throws at her first practice.\nThe answer is: 24",
        "\nLet's call the number of free throws Jenny made at the first practice x.\nSince Jenny made 2 times as many free throws at each practice than the previous one, at the second practice, she made 2x free throws.\nAt the third practice, she made 2 * 2x = 4x free throws.\nAt the fourth practice, she made 2 * 4x = 8x free throws.\nFinally, at the fifth practice, she made 48 free throws, which is 2 * 8x = 16x.\nWe can set up an equation based on this information: 2x = 48.\nSimplifying the equation, we divide both sides by 2: x = 24.\nTherefore, Jenny made 24 free throws at the first practice.\n#### 24\nThe answer is: 24",
        "\nLast week, Jenny made twice as many free throws as she made at the fifth practice. This means she made 48/2 = <<48/2=24>>24 free throws at the previous practice.\nBefore that, she made half of that number or 24/2 = <<24/2=12>>12 free throws at the fourth practice.\nAnd before that, she made half of that number or 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 free throws at the third practice.\nAnd before that, she made half of that number or 6/2 = <<6/2=3>>3 free throws at the second practice.\nAnd before that, she made half of that number or 3/2 = <<3/2=1.5>>1.5 free throws at the first practice.\nSince we can only type whole numbers, we round down to the nearest whole number. Jenny made 1 free throw at the first practice.\n#### 1\nThe answer is: 1",
        "\nLet\u2019s denote the number of free throws Jenny made at the first practice as x.\nAccording to the information given, at her fifth practice, she made twice as many free throws as she made at the previous practice, which is (48/2\u5ba2\u6236) = 24.\nTherefore, we can set up the equation x * 2 = 24\uff0c which simplifies to 2x = 24.\nDividing both sides by 2, we find that x = 12.\nSo, Jenny made 12 free throws at her first practice.",
        "\nAt the fifth practice, Jenny made twice as many free throws as she made at the fourth practice.\nIf we let x be the number of free throws she made at the fourth practice, then she made 2x free throws at the fifth practice.\nWe are given that she made 48 free throws at the fifth practice.\nSo, 2x = 48\nDividing both sides by 2, x = 24\nTherefore, Jenny made 24 free throws at the first practice.\n#### 24\nThe answer is: 24",
        "\nWe know that at her fifth practice, Jenny made 48 free throws.\nWe also know that at each subsequent practice, Jenny made twice as many free throws as she did at the previous practice.\nSo, at the fourth practice, Jenny made 48/2 = <<48/2=24>>24 free throws.\nAt the third practice, Jenny made 24/2 = <<24/2=12>>12 free throws.\nAnd at the second practice, Jenny made 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 free throws.\nFinally, at the first practice, Jenny made 6/2 = <<6/2=3>>3 free throws.\nSo, Jenny made 3 free throws at her first practice.\n#### 3\nThe answer is: 3",
        " Let x be the number of free throws Jenny made at the first practice.\nAt her second practice, she made 2x free throws. The total number of free throws she made at practice is:\nx + 2x = 3x\nAt her third practice, she made 2(3x) = 6x free throws.\nAt her fourth practice, she made 2(6x) = 12x free throws.\nAt her fifth practice, she made 2(12x) = 24x free throws.\nAccording to the problem, at her fifth practice, Jenny made 48 free throws.\nTherefore, 24x = 48\nLet's solve for x by dividing both sides by 24.\nx = 48/24 = <<48/24=2>>2\nThe number of free throws Jenny made at the first practice is 2.
