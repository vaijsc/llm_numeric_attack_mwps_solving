        "\nWe know that Simon spent a total of $\\$12.75$, which includes the entry fee also. \nSo, let's assume Simon paid $R$ rides for.\nThe total amount spent on rides is $1.50 \\times R$.\nWe can set up an equation: $1.50R + 2.25 = 12.75$\nNow let's solve for $R$.\nSubtracting 2.25 from both sides, we have $1.50R = 10.50$\nDividing both sides by 1.50, we have $R = 7$\nTherefore, Simon paid for $\\boxed{7}$ rides.\nThe answer is: 7",
        " \nWe can set up an equation based on the given information:\n$\\$2.25 + (number of rides) \\times \\$1.50 = \\$12.75$\nWe need to solve for the number of rides, so we need to isolate it on one side of the equation.\nLet's subtract $\\$2.25$ from both sides of the equation:\n$(number of rides) \\times \\$1.50 = \\$12.75 - \\$2.25$\n$(number of rides) \\times \\$1.50 = \\$10.50$\nNow, we need to solve for the number of rides by dividing both sides of the equation by $\\$1.50$:\nnumber of rides = $\\frac{\\$10.50}{\\$1.50}$\nnumber of rides = 7\nSo, Simon paid for 7 rides.\nThe answer is: 7",
        "\nThe entry fee is $\\$2.25$. \nSo the remaining after paying the entry fee is $\\$12.75 - \\$2.25 = \\$10.50$. \nThe cost of a ride is $\\$1.50$. \nSince Simon had $\\$10.50$ left after paying the entry fee, he could have paid for $\\$10.50/ \\$1.50 = 7$ rides. \nSo, Simon paid for $\\boxed{7}$ rides."
