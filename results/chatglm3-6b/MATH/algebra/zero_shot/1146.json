        " To find the total number of toy cars Aiden will have received from Jo, we will add up the number of cars he receives each year from his first birthday to his twelfth birthday.",
        " We can start by adding up all the numbers from 1 to 12. The sum is 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 12 = sum(1 to 12) = 66.\nTherefore, Aiden will have received a total of 66 toy cars from Jo after his 12th birthday.",
        "\n#### Stept 1: Identify the pattern for the number of cars Aiden receives each year.\n- For his first birthday, Aiden received 1 car.\n- For his second birthday, Aiden received 2 cars.\n- For his third birthday, Aiden received 3 cars.\n- And so on...",
        "\nAiden's first birthday car is 1.\nSo many\u8f86 birthday cars Aiden will receive after his first birthday is 1.\nAiden's second birthday car is 2.\nAfter his first birthday, Aiden will receive 1 unless there\u53e6\u4e00 birthday that is after his first birthday. \nSo many birthday cars Aiden will receive after his second birthday is 1 + 2 = 3.\nAiden's third birthday car is 3.\nAfter his second birthday, Aiden will receive 1 unless there\u4e0b\u4e00 birthday that is before his third birthday.  \nSo many birthday cars Aiden will receive after his third birthday is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.\nWe can observe that for birthday n, \nThe number of birthday cars Aiden will receive after his nth birthday is 1 + 2 + ... + n\nThis is an arithmetic series with first term 1, common difference 1, and nth term. \nThe sum of an arithmetic series is given by the formula Sn = (n/2)(a + l), where Sn is the sum of the series, n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and l is the last term.\nSo, the sum of birthday cars Aiden will receive after his 12th birthday is (12/2)(1 + 12) = 6(13) = 78.\nTherefore, after receiving cars for his 12th birthday, Aiden will have received a total of 78 toy cars from Jo.",
