Therefore, we don't have to worry about powers of $12$ in the given equation, but we do have to convert $2^x$ to $12^2$. To do so, we need to write the exponent of $12$ in terms of a power of $2$. Since $12=2^2$, we get $2^x=12^2=2^{2\\cdot2}=2^4$. Therefore, we can rewrite the expression on the left side of the equation as $2^4\\cdot3^y$.\n### Solution: We can solve for $x$ and $y$ by substituting these values into the equation. Since we have $2^x=2^4$, we know that $x=4$. Similarly, since there are three $3$'s in the right side of the equation and one $3$ on the left side, we know that $y=1$.
