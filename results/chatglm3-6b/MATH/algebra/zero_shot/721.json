    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let the number of miles Phoenix hiked in each day be $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$. We have the equations \\begin{align*}\na+b&=26\\\\\n(b+c)/2=12 \\Rightarrow b+c&=24\\\\\nc+d&=28\\\\\na+c&=22\n\\end{align*} Adding the first two equations gives $a+2b+c=50$. Subtracting the fourth equation from this last equation, we have $2b=28$, or $b=14$. Plugging this value of $b$ into the first given equation to solve for $a$, we find that $a=12$. Plugging this value of $a$ into the fourth given equation to solve for $c$, we find that $c=10$. Finally, plugging $c$ into the third equation gives $d=18$. Thus, the entire trail was $a+b+c+d=12+14+10+18=\\boxed{54}$ miles long.\n\nOf course, you could also have realized that the total for the first two days was 26 miles and the total for the last two days was 28 miles, meaning that the total for all four days is $26 + 28 = \\boxed{54}$ miles.",

So, on the second day, she hiked 12 miles and on the third day, she hiked 12 miles as well. In total, she hiked 12 + 12 = <<12+12=24>>24 miles on those two days.\nOn the fourth day, she hiked a total of 28 miles.\nSo, the total miles for the five-day hike is 24 miles + 28 miles = <<24+28=52>>52 miles.\nWe are given that the first two days she hiked a total of 26 miles. We are also given that she hiked a total of 22 miles on the first and third days.\nSo, the total miles for the first and third days is 26 miles + 22 miles = <<26+22=48>>48 miles.\nTo find out how long the trail was, we need to add the total miles for the first, third, and fourth days to the total miles for the second and fifth days.\nTherefore, the trail was 52 miles + 48 miles = <<52+48=100>>100 miles long.\n#### 100\nThe answer is: 100",
