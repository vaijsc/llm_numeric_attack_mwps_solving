Therefore, the given equation becomes $\\left(\\frac{1}{9}\\right)^x = 9^{x+3}$.\nNow, combining the powers, we get $\\left(\\frac{1}{9}\\right)^x = (3^2)^{x+3}$.\nSince $\\left(\\frac{1}{9}\\right)^x =(\\left(\\frac{1}{9}\\right)^{-1}\\right)^x = \\left(9^{-1}\\right)^x=9^{-x} = 3^{-x}$, we have $3^{-x}=3^{2(x+3)}$.\nThe equation $3^{-x}=3^{2(x+3)}$ implies $2(x+3)=-x$. \nNow let's solve for $x$.\n$2(x+3)=-x \\Rightarrow 2x+6=-x$ $\\Rightarrow$ $3x+6=0$. $\\Rightarrow$ $3x=-6$ $\\Rightarrow$ $x=-\\frac{6}{3}=-2$.\nTherefore, the solution to the given equation is $x=\\boxed{-2}$.",
        "\nTo solve equation (\\(\\frac{1}{9}\\)^x = 3^{x+3}\\), we can use properties of exponents.\nThe left side can be written as \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{3^2}\\right)^x = 3^{-2x}\\).\nAlso, $3^{x+3} = 3^x \\cdot 3^3 = 3^{x+3}$.\nTherefore, the equation becomes\n$$3^{-2x} = 3^{x+3}.$$\nWhen exponents with the same base have the same base, then we can subtract their exponents.\nSo, we have \\(-2x = x+3\\).\nNow, let\u2019s solve this equation.\nAdding $2x$ to both sides, we have \\(0 = 2x + x + 3\\).\nCombining like terms, we have \\(0 = 3x + 3\\).\nSubtracting 3 from both sides, we have \\(-3 = 3x\\).\nFinally, dividing both sides by 3, we have \\(x = -1\\).\nTherefore, the solution to the equation is \\(x = -1\\).",
        "\nFirst, we can rewrite 3 as $3^1$:\n$$\\left(\\frac{1}{9}\\right)^x = 3^1 \\implies \\left(\\frac{1}{9}\\right)^x = 3.$$\nNext, we can rewrite $\\frac{1}{9}$ as $3^{-2}$:\n$$3^{-2}^x = 3.$$\nUsing the property of exponents, we have:\n$$3^{-2x} = 3.$$\nSince we are looking for a value of $x$, we need to solve for $x$.

        "\nWe can see that $\\left(\\frac{1}{9}\\right)^x$ is a power of 3 to the power of $x - 2$ because $\\frac{1}{9} = 3^{-2},$ and $3^{-x} = \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^x = \\frac{1}{3^{x-1}}.$  Therefore, we can write $\\left(\\frac{1}{9}\\right)^x = 3^{-2x}.$\nWe can also see that $3^{x + 3}$ is a power of 3 to the power of $x + 3.$  Hence, $3^{x + 3} = 3^x \\cdot 3^3 = 3^x \\cdot 27,$ so\n\\[3^x \\cdot 27 = 3^{-2x}.\\]Multiplying both sides by $\\frac{3^x}{27},$ we get\n\\[3^{x - 2} = 1.\\]Therefore, $x - 2 = 0,$ so $x = \\boxed{2}.$",
        "\nFirst, we can rewrite $3^{x+3}$ as $(3^x)(3^3)=(3^x)(27)$.  So, our equation becomes \\begin{align*}\n\\left(\\frac{1}{9}\\right)^x &= (3^x)(27) \\\\\n\\left(\\frac{1}{9}\\right)^x &= 3^{x+3}.\n\\end{align*}Since the bases are equal, the exponents must be equal as well.

        "\nWe can rewrite $3^{x+3}$ as $(3^3)^{x+3}=3^{3(x+3)}$. Trying different powers of $3$ until we get to our expression in the right side makes sense, since our original equation is an equation with the base $3.$\nPlaying with the exponent, we can add another power of $3$ to the left-hand side of the equation to make it an equation of the form $3^a \\pretty\u4e00\u5708numberpower \\\ufffd\ufffd given values$.

        "\nFirst, we note that both sides have the same base. There is no need to change the base to solve this problem. \nWe can proceed by taking fundamental exponents of both sides.\nWhile raising to a power by multiplying the exponent in the numerator by the exponent in the denominator, we will also adjust the exponent of the other number.\n$$\\left(\\frac{1}{9}\\right)^x = (3^2)^{3^x} = 3^{2\\cdot 3^x}$$\nFinally, we can combine the exponents on the right side to find the solution.\nSo now our equation becomes:\n$$\\left(\\frac{1}{9}\\right)^x = 3^{2\\cdot 3^x}$$\nSince the bases are equal, the exponents must be equal.
