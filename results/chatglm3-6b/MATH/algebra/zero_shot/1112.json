We do this by finding the vertex of the parabola given by $f(x) = 9x^2 + 18x + 7$. \nThe vertex of a parabola $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ is given by $h = -\\frac{b}{2a}$. In this case, $a = 9$ and $b = 18$, so the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $x = -\\frac{18}{2(9)} = -\\frac{18}{18} = -1$.\nTherefore, the value of $x$ that will give the minimum value of $9x^2 + 18x + 7$ is $\\boxed{-1}$.",
        " To find the minimum value of the quadratic function $9x^2 + 18x + 7$, we can use the formula for the x-coordinate of the vertex, which is given by the equation $x = -\\frac{b}{2a}$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the coefficients of the quadratic equation in the form $ax^2 + bx + c$.\nIn this case, $a = 9$, $b = 18$, and $c = 7$. Therefore,\nx = -18/2(9)\nx = -18/18\nx = -1.\nTo verify that this value gives the minimum value, we can substitute it back into the original equation and check if the function is below this value:\n9(-1)^2 + 18(-1) + 7\n9 + 18 - 7\n30 - 7\n23.\nThe value 23 is indeed less than -1, so the function is below this value. Therefore, -1 is the value that will give the minimum value for $9x^2 + 18x + 7$.",
