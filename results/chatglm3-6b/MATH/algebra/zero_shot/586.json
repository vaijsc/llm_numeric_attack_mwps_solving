    "solution": "The only way that 5 can be expressed as the product of two positive integers is as $5 = 1 \\times 5$.  Therefore, the first and third terms are 1 and 5, in some order.  Since all the terms in the sequence are positive integers, the common difference must be nonnegative, so the first term is 1, and the third term is 5.\n\nThen the second term is the average of the first term (namely 1) and the third term (namely 5), or $(1 + 5)/2 = 3$.  Therefore, the common difference is $3 - 1 = 2$, and the fourth term is $5 + 2 = \\boxed{7}$.",

        " Let's set up the problem with variables. Let's let the first term of the arithmetic sequence be $a$, and the common difference be $d$. The third term would then be $a+2d$.\nThe problem states that the product of the first and third terms is 5, so we can set up the equation:\n$(a)(a+2d) = 5$\nExpanding the equation, we get:\n$a^2 + 2ad = 5$\nWe also know that the terms of the sequence are positive integers, so $a$ and $ad$ must be positive integers. We can list the possible pairs of positive integers whose product is 5:\n$(a, a d) = (1, 5), (5, 1), (-1, -5), (-5, -1)$\nSince $a$ and $ad$ are both positive integers, we can eliminate the pairs that have negative numbers:\n$(a, a d) = (1, 5), (5, 1)$\nNow, let's consider the second equation, $a + 2d$, for each pair:\nFor the pair $(1, 5)$, we have $a + 2d = 6$\nFor the pair $(5, 1)$, we have $a + 2d = 6$\nBoth equations give us the same value when we solve them, so either one of them is correct.
