        "\nTo solve the inequality $(x-5)(x+5)<0$, we can consider the sign of each factor.\nFirst, let's look at the sign table for $x-5$ and $x+5$:\n| $x$ | $x-5$ | $x+5$ |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| $x$ | - | + |\n| $x$ | - | + |\n| $x$ | + | + |\n| $x$ | + | + |\nNext, let's change the inequality into $(x-1)(x-3)(x-5)>0$. To find the points where this expression changes sign, we need to find where $x-1=(x-3)=(x-5)$ changes sign.  Since\u8fd9\u4e09\u4e2a equations are equations of straight lines, this can only happen at a multiple of the $x$-coordinate of their\u4ea4\u70b9, which occurs when \\[x-1=x-3=x-5,\\] or  $x=3,5$.\nIf $x=3$, then \\[3<5,\\] which\u7b80\u5316\u65b9\u7a0b\u5f0f\u4e3a 0<0, indicating that the expression is positive. If $x=5$, then \\[5>3,\\] which simplifies into 0>0, indicating that the expression is negative. Furthermore, as $x$ increases both $x-1$ and $x+5$ increase, and these are both positive, the expression $(x-1)(x-3)(x-5)$ will be positive for $x>3$.   On the other hand, as $x$ decreases, both $x-1$ and $x-5$ decrease, and they are both negative. But since the factor of $(x-3)$ is always positive, $(x-1)(x-3)(x-5)$ will be negative only when $x<1$.\nSince we want $(x-1)(x-3)(x-5)>0$, the solution is $x>(3)$. Since westart with the inequality $(x-5)(x+5)<0$, this means $3<x<5$. Therefore, the inequality applies when \\[3< x<5.\\]",

        " To solve this inequality, we can start by factoring the expression on the left side. We have $(x-5)(x+5)$, which can be factored as $(x-5)(x+5) =x^2 - 25$. \nNext, we need to determine the values of $x$ that make $x^2 - 25$ positive or negative. \nFor $x^2 - 25$ to be positive, we need $x^2 > 25$. \nFor $x^2 - 25$ to be negative, we need $x^2 < 25$. \nWe can factor $25$ as $5^2$. \nTherefore, $x^2$ can be either greater than $5^2$ or equal to $5^2$. \nIf $x^2 > 5^2$, then $x^2$ can be greater than $25$ or less than $25$. \nTherefore, the inequality becomes $x^2 < 25$. \nIf $x^2 = 5^2$, then $x^2$ must be equal to $25$. \nTherefore, the inequality becomes $x^2 > 25$. \nHowever, solving $x^2 = 25$ for $x$ is not possible, since the equation $x^2 = 25$ has no real solutions.\nTherefore, the solution to the inequality $x^2 - 25 > 0$ is $x^2 > 25$, which means the solutions for $x$ are $x < \\sqrt{25} = 5$ or $x > 5$. \nNow, we need to check if any numbers in the range $x < 5$ or $x > 5$ satisfy the inequality $(x-5)(x+5) < 0$. \nStarting with $x = 4$, we have $(4-5)(4+5) = (-1)(9) = -9$, which is less than zero. \nNext, let's try $x = 6$.

However, the inequality has a multiplication or duplication symbol, so we need to consider two intervals: $x<-5$ and $x>-5$.\nFor $x<-5$, both factors $x-5$ and $x+5$ are negative. Therefore, the product $(x-5)(x+5)$ is positive.\nFor $x>-5$, both factors $x-5$ and $x+5$ are positive. Therefore, the product $(x-5)(x+5)$ is also positive.\nNext, we have to test the values in each interval to determine the sign of the expression $(x-5)(x+5)$.\nFor $x<-5$, let's take $x=-6$. Then $x+5=-1$ and $x-5=-6$. Therefore, $(x-5)(x+5)=(-6-1)(-6+5)=(-7)(1)=-7$ which is negative.\nFor $x>-5$, let's take $x=6$. Then $x+5=11$ and $x-5=1$. Therefore, $(x-5)(x+5)=(6-5)(6+5)=(1)(11)=11$ which is positive.\nFrom this, we can conclude that the expression $(x-5)(x+5)$ changes sign at $x=5$.\nNow, we multiply out quadratics andslant signs.
