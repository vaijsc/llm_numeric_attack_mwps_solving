        "\nFirst, we need to find the inverse function $f^{-1}(x)$. In other words, we want to express $y$ as a function of $x$.\nTo find the inverse of a given function $f(x)$, we need to replace $f(x)$ with $x$ and solve for $x$.\nSo, we have the equation $x = 4y^3 + 1$.\nNow, let's solve for $y$.\nStarting with the equation $x = 4y^3 + 1$, we can isolate $y$ by subtracting $1$ from both sides.\nThis gives us $4y^3 = x - 1$.\nNext, we can divide both sides of the equation by $4$ to simplify.\nDividing both sides by $4$, we get $y^3 = \\frac{x - 1}{4}$.\nTaking the cube root of both sides, we find $y = \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{x - 1}{4}}$.\nTherefore, the inverse function is $f^{-1}(x) = \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{x - 1}{4}}$.\nNow that we have the inverse function, we can find $f^{-1}(33)$.\nPlugging $33$ into the inverse function, we get $f^{-1}(33) = \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{33 - 1}{4}}$.\nSimplifying this expression, we find $f^{-1}(33) = \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{32}{4}}$.\nUsing the cube root function, we have $f^{-1}(33) = \\sqrt[3]{8}$.\nThe cube root of $8$ is $2$, so $f^{-1}(33) = \\boxed{2}$.The answer is: 2",
        " To find $f^{-1}(33)$, we need to find the value of $x$ that satisfies $f(x) = 33$.\nWe start by setting up the equation $4x^3 + 1 = 33$.\nNext, we subtract 1 from both sides to get $4x^3 = 32$.\nThen, we divide both sides by 4 to get $x^3 = 8$.\nFinally, we take the cube root of both sides to get $x = 2$.\nTherefore, $f^{-1}(33) = \\boxed{2}$.The answer is: 2",
