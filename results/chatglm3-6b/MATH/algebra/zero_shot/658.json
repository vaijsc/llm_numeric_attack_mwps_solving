The corresponding linear equation is:\nnot yetconfined$s+2=0.$\nBut this equation can be divided by 2:\n$s+2=0$.\nNow we have one possible value for $s$ (which is negative), so in the quadratic $s(s+2)=19$ two possible solutions will be obtained. $s=-9$ and $s=-1$. \nIn both cases, $2s=2\\cdot(-9)=-18$, or $s=-9$. Or $s=2$. So,\nFrom the two solutions of $s$, we have two pairs of solutions for $(s,x)$ which are:\n$s,-1 \\Longrightarrow (s,x) = (-1,-9),$\n$s,-1 \\Longrightarrow (s,x) = (-1,-1),$\n$s,2 \\Longrightarrow (s,x) = (2,-1),$\n$s,2 \\Longrightarrow (s,x) = (2,1).$\nNotice that whenever we add the $x$, $y$, $z$, the value of $x^2+y^2+z^2$ does not change.
