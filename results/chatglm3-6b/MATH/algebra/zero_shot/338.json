        "\nLet the rate at which Mike rides his bicycle be $r$ miles per hour.\nSince he rides for $t$ hours, the distance he covers is $r \\cdot t$.\nJosh, who rides at $\\frac{4}{5}$ of Mike's rate, will take $\\frac{5}{4} \\cdot t$ hours to cover the same distance.\nThus, the distance Josh covers is $\\left( \\frac{4}{5} \\cdot r \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\frac{5}{4} \\cdot t \\right) = \\frac{4}{5} \\cdot r \\cdot t \\cdot \\frac{5}{4}$.\nWe know they met at the same location, 13 miles away, and Josh rode 2 times as long as Mike.\nTherefore the time Josh spent riding his bicycle is $2t$ hours and Mike's is $t$ hours. \nTaking these into account, using the formula $\\text{distance}= \\text{rate} \\cdot \\text{time}$, we have:\n$\\left( \\frac{4}{5} \\cdot r \\right) \\cdot t \\cdot \\frac{5}{4} = 13$\nWe want to find the distance Mike has ridden at that point.\nFirst, simplify the fraction:\n$\\left( \\frac{4}{5} \\right) \\cdot r \\cdot t \\cdot \\left( \\frac{5}{4} \\right) = 13$\nNow, rearrange the equation to solve for $r \\cdot t$:\n$4r \\cdot t = \\frac{13 \\cdot 4 }{5}$\n$r \\cdot t = \\frac{52}{5}$\n Innovative problem solving method:\nSince we want the amount of distance Mike has ridden when they met, we need to know the speed at which he rides. So let's find $r \\cdot t$:\n$r \\cdot t = \\frac{52}{5} \\to r= \\frac{52}{5t}$\nWe also know that the distance between Josh and Mike is 13 miles.\nSo we have the equation $\\left( \\frac{4}{5} \\cdot r \\right) \\cdot",

So, in 2x hours, PB would have ridden 8/5 * 2x miles.\nSince they started at the same point and rode toward each other, we can say that the total distance Mike had ridden when they met is equal to the total distance Josh had ridden when they met. Therefore, we can set up an equation:\nx = 8/5 * 2x\nTo solve this equation, we can multiply both sides by 5 to eliminate the fraction and then divide by 2 to get the value of x:\n2x * 5 / 2 = 8/5 * 2x * 5 / 2\nx = 4\nSo, Mike had ridden 4 miles when they met.",
