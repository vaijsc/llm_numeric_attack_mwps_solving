Substituting these values into the formula, we get $I = \\$2000 \\times 0.05 \\times 18 = \\$360$. \nTo find out how much money Frederick will have when he collects the money, we need to add the principal amount and the interest.  Therefore, the total amount required to collect the money is $2000 + 360 = \\$2360$. \nThus, Frederick will have $\\$2360$ when he collects the money after $18$ years.",
        " Frederick's gratitude argument states that he sent back up to $2000 \\cdot  \\frac{1}{2} = \\boxed{1000}$ percentage of that amount, which results in the For all future time, he sends back up to $8$ percent of the money he gets, each year.",
        " The formula for simple interest is $I=P\\cdot r\\cdot t$, where $P$ is the principal amount, $r$ is the rate of interest, and $t$ is the number of years.\nIn this case, the principal amount is $2000$ and the rate of interest is $5\\%$, or $0.05$ when expressed in decimal form. The number of years is $18$.\nPlugging in the values, we get $I=2000\\cdot0.05\\cdot18=27$, which gives us $27$ dollars in simple interest.\nTherefore, Frederick will have $2000+27=\\boxed{2027}$ dollars when he can collect the money at the age of $18$.",
