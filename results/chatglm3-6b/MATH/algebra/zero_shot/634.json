        "\nSince $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3, the highest power of $x$ in $f(x)$ is $x^3$. \nSince $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 5, the highest power of $x$ in $g(x)$ is $x^5$. \nWhen we add or subtract two polynomials, the degree of the resulting polynomial is the highest power of $x$ in the resulting polynomial. \nTherefore, the degree of the resulting polynomial $2f(x) + 4g(x)$ is $\\max(3, 5) = \\boxed{5}$.\nThe answer is: 5",
        "\nDegree of $2f(x) + 4g(x)$ = $3 + 5 = \\boxed{8}$.  The answer is 8"
