        " To find the minimum value of a quadratic expression, we can complete the square. However, by observing the coefficients of $a^2$, $a$, and the constant term, we can deduce that the coefficient of $a^2$ is positive and the coefficient of $a$ is positive, which means the parabola opens upward. Hence, the minimum value of $a^2 + 6a - 7$ occurs at its vertex. \nThe x-coordinate of the vertex can be found by using the formula $x = -\\frac{b}{2a}$, where $a$ is the coefficient of $a^2$ and $b$ is the coefficient of $a$. In this case, $a = 1$ and $b = 6$, so the x-coordinate of the vertex is $x = -\\frac{6}{2(1)} = -3$. \nNow, we can substitute this value of $x$ into the quadratic expression $a^2 + 6a - 7$ to find the y-coordinate of the vertex. \n$y = a^2 + 6a - 7 = (-3)^2 + 6(-3) - 7 = 9 - 18 - 7 = -24$.\nTherefore, the minimum value of $a^2 + 6a - 7$ is $-24$.",

The quadratic formula states that for an equation of the form $ax^2 + bx + c$, the roots are given by $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$. The minimum value of the quadratic expression occurs at the vertex of the parabola, which is the point where the coefficient of $x^2$ is 0.\nIn this case, the coefficient of $a^2$ is 1, so the quadratic formula states that the roots are given by $x = \\frac{-6 \\pm \\sqrt{6^2 - 4(1)(-7)}}{2(1)}$. Simplifying the expression under the square root gives $x = \\frac{-6 \\pm \\sqrt{36 + 28}}{2} = \\frac{-6 \\pm \\sqrt{64}}{2} = \\frac{-6 \\pm 8}{2}$.\nTherefore, the two possible vertices are $x = 2$ and $x = -4$. To find the minimum value of the quadratic expression, we substitute each of these values of $x$ into the expression and see which one results in a smaller value.

The square of 3 is 9. Therefore, we have:\n$a^2+6a-7=(a^2+6a+9)-16$\nNow we can factor the perfect square trinomial inside the parentheses:\n$(a+3)^2-16$\nSo, the expression can be written as:\n$(a+3)^2-16$\nTo find the minimum value, we can see that the minimum value of $(a+3)^2$ is 0, which occurs when $a=-3$. \nTherefore, the minimum value of $a^2+6a-7$ is:\n$(a+3)^2-16=0-16=\\boxed{-16}$.",
        "\nWe can rewrite the expression $a^2 + 6a - 7$ as $(a + 3)^2 - 16$.\nSince $(a + 3)^2$ is always nonnegative, the minimum value of $(a + 3)^2 - 16$ occurs when $(a + 3)^2$ is equal to 0.\nThis happens when $a + 3 = 0$, so the minimum value is $\\boxed{-16}$.The answer is: -16",
        "\nThe expression $a^2+6a-7$ is a quadratic expression in the form $ax^2+bx+c$ where $a=1$, $b=6$, and $c=-7$. The minimum value of the quadratic expression $ax^2+bx+c$ with $a=1$, $b=6$, and $c=-7$ occurs at $x=-\\frac{b}{2a}=-\\frac{6}{2\\cdot 1}=-3$. Thus, the minimum value of the expression $a^2+6a-7$ is $x=-\\frac{b}{2a}=-3$.\n### Answer:\nThe minimum value of $a^2+6a-7$ is $-3$.",
        "\nWe can find the minimum value of the quadratic function by completing the square.\nFirst, let\u2019s write down the quadratic in vertex form:\n$$a^2+6a-7=(a+3)^2-16$$\nSince the coefficient of $a^2$ is positive, the parabola opens upward. So, the vertex is the minimum point of the parabola.\nThe x-coordinate of the vertex is given by:\n$$a=-\\frac{b}{2a}=-\\frac{6}{2(-1)}=3$$\nTo find the y-coordinate of the vertex, substitute the value of $a$ into the quadratic:\n$$(3+3)^2-16=16-16=\\boxed{-7}$$\nTherefore, the minimum value of $a^2+6a-7$ is $-7$."
