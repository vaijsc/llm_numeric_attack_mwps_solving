        " To begin, we'll multiply both sides of the equation by $x+6$ to clear the fraction. \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{9-4x}{x+6} &= 7\\\\\n(9-4x)(x+6) &= 7(x+6)\\\\\n9x+54-4x^2-24x &= 7x+42\\\\\n-4x^2+5x-12 &= 0\n\\end{align*}\n### Solution: To solve this quadratic equation, we can either factor it or use the quadratic formula. Let's use the quadratic formula: \\[x = \\frac{-b\\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}.\\]\nIn this case, $a = -4$, $b = 5$, and $c = -12$. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\\[x = \\frac{-5\\pm \\sqrt{5^2-4(-4)(-12)}}{2(-4)}\\]\n\\[x = \\frac{-5\\pm \\sqrt{25+192}}{-8}\\]\n\\[x = \\frac{-5\\pm \\sqrt{217}}{-8}\\]\nThe discriminant, $b^2-4ac$, must be a perfect square for the quadratic to have real solutions. In this case, $b^2-4ac = 25-4(-4)(-12) = 25+192 = 217$ is not a perfect square. Therefore, the quadratic equation has no real solutions.\nThus, there is no value of $x$ that can satisfy the equation $\\frac{9-4x}{x+6}=7$.",
