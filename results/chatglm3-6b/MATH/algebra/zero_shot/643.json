        "\nTo determine the rock-climbing shoe size for Adina, we need to use the information given about Lynn's normal shoe size and her rock-climbing shoe size. Since the shoe sizes are directly proportional, we can set up a proportion.\nLet's set up the proportion:\n9 (Lynn's normal shoe size) / 42 (Lynn's rock-climbing shoe size) = 6 (Adina's normal shoe size) / x (Adina's rock-climbing shoe size)\nTo solve for x, we can cross-multiply and divide:\n9 * x = 6 * 42\nDividing both sides by 9, we find:\nx = 25.22 (rounded to two decimal places)\nTherefore, Adina should rent rock-climbing shoes in the size 25.22.",
        " Let's find the ratio of normal shoe size to rock-climbing shoe size.\nWe know that Lynn's normal shoe size is 9 and her rock-climbing shoe size is 42. \nThe ratio of normal shoe size to rock-climbing shoe size is 9/42 = 3/14. \nTo find Adina's rock-climbing shoe size, we can set up the proportion:\nAdina's normal shoe size/Adina's rock-climbing shoe size = Lynn's normal shoe size/Lynn's rock-climbing shoe size.\n6/x = 3/14.\nCross-multiplying, we get 6 * 14 = 3 * x.\n84 = 3x.\nDividing both sides by 3, we find x = 28.\nTherefore, Adina should rent rock-climbing shoes in size 28. \n#### 28\nThe answer is: 28",
        " \nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the rock-climbing shoe size that corresponds to Adina's normal shoe size of 6.
