        " \nFirst, we need to find the distance formula for the distance between two points in a coordinate plane. The formula is $\\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2}$.\nUsing this formula, we can find the distance between the two given points $(1,2)$ and $(-4,-10)$: \nDistance = $\\sqrt{((-4)-(1))^2+((-10)-(2))^2}$\n              = $\\sqrt{(-5)^2+(-12)^2}$\n              = $\\sqrt{25+144}$\n              = $\\sqrt{169}$\n              = 13\nSo, the segment is 13 units long.",
        " To find the length of the segment whose endpoints are $(1,2)$ and $(-4,-10)$, we can use the distance formula.\nThe distance formula states that the distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by $\\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2}$.\nIn this case, we need to find the distance between $(1,2)$ and $(-4,-10)$. Let's plug in the coordinates into the formula:\n$\\sqrt{(-4-1)^2+(-10-2)^2}$\nNow let's simplify the expression inside the square root:\n$\\sqrt{(-5)^2+(-12)^2}$\nNow compute the square roots:\n$\\sqrt{25+144}$\nNow let's add the square roots together:\n$\\sqrt{169}$\nSince $\\sqrt{169}=13$, the length of the segment is $\\boxed{13}$ units.",
