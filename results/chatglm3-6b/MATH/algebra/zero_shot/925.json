        "\nLet the numbers be $x$ and $y$, where $x>y$.\nAccording to the given information, we can set up two equations:\n\\begin{align*}\nx+y &= 25, \\\\\nx-y &= 11.\n\\end{align*}\nTo solve for $x$, we add the two equations:\n\\begin{align*}\n2x &= 36, \\\\\nx &= 18.\n\\end{align*}\nTherefore, the larger of the two numbers is $\\boxed{18}$.",
        "\nTo solve this problem, let\u2019s use algebra. We know that the sum of the two numbers is 25, so we can write an equation:  + = 25\nWe also know that the difference between the two numbers is 11, so we can write another equation:  - = 11\nNow, let\u2019s solve for the unknown numbers.\nFrom the first equation, we can isolate x by subtracting y from both sides:  x = 25 - y\nSubstituting this into the second equation, we get:  x - y = 11\nNow we can solve for y by isolating it on one side of the equation: y = x - 11\nFinally, substituting the values of x and y back into the original equations, we can determine that the larger of the two numbers is x, which is 14.\n#### 14\nThe answer is: 14",
        "\nLet's call the two numbers x and y. According to the problem, we have the following two equations:\nx + y = 25   (Equation 1)\nx - y = 11   (Equation 2)\nTo find the larger number, which is x, we can add both equations together:\n(x + y) + (x - y) = 25 + 11\nThis simplifies to:\n2x = 36\nTo solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:\nx = 36 \u00f7 2\nx = 18\nTherefore, the larger number is 18.",
