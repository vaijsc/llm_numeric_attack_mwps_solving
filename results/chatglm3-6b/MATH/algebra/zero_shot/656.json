        " To find the degree of $f$, we need to determine the term with the highest exponent of $x$ in $f(x)$. Notice that the degree of $5x^6$ is 6. We can Taylor expand the equation $(x^2-1)\\cdot f(x)$ to see what to expect. By multiplying out $(x^2-1)\\cdot f(x)$, we get \\[(x^2-1)\\cdot f(x) = f(x)\\cdot(x^2-1) = f(x)\\cdot x^2-f(x)\\cdot 0\\]For the term $f(x)\\cdot x^2$ to be $5x^6$ when term $x$ is multiplied out, we  know the degree of $f\\cdot x^2$ must be 6. Thus $f(x)\\cdot x^2 = 5x^6\\Rightarrow f(x)=5x^4$. So the answer is $\\boxed{4}$, and we have shown that it will work."
