        "Let John's age be represented as \\( ab \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are the digits of his age. The number \\( ab \\) can be expressed as \\( 10a + b \\). When we reverse the digits, John's age becomes \\( ba \\), which can be expressed as \\( 10b + a \\).\nAccording to the problem:\n1. The positive difference between their ages is 27:\n   \\[\n   |(10b + a) - (10a + b)| = 27\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   |9b - 9a| = 27\n   \\]\n   Dividing both sides by 9, we have:\n   \\[\n   |b - a| = 3\n   \\]\nThis gives us two cases:\n- Case 1: \\( b - a = 3 \\)\n- Case 2: \\( a - b = 3 \\)\n2. The sum of the digits in each age is 5:\n   \\[\n   a + b = 5\n   \\]\nNow we can solve for both cases.\n### Case 1: \\( b - a = 3 \\)\nFrom \\( b - a = 3 \\), we can express \\( b \\) in terms of \\( a \\):\n\\[\nb = a + 3\n\\]\nSubstituting into the sum of the digits equation:\n\\[\na + (a + 3) = 5\n\\]\n\\[\n2a + 3 = 5\n\\]\n\\[\n2a = 2\n\\]\n\\[\na = 1\n\\]\nThen,\n\\[\nb = 1 + 3 = 4\n\\]\nSo, John's age (\\( ab \\)) is \\( 14 \\). Therefore, his father's age (\\( ba \\)) would be \\( 41 \\).\n### Case 2: \\( a - b = 3 \\)\nFrom \\( a - b = 3 \\), we can express \\( a \\) in terms of \\( b \\):\n\\[\na = b + 3\n\\]\nSubstituting into the sum of the digits equation:\n\\[\n(b + 3) + b = 5\n\\]\n\\[\n2b + 3 = 5\n\\]\n\\[\n2b = 2\n\\]\n\\[\nb = 1\n\\]\nThen,\n\\[\na = 1 + 3 = 4\n\\]\nSo, John's age (\\( ab \\)) is \\( 41 \\). Therefore, his father's age (\\( ba \\)) would be \\( 14 \\).\n### Conclusion\nIn both cases, John's father's age when reversed equals John's age and meets both conditions. Therefore, John's father's age is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{41}\n\\]",
        "Let John's age be represented as the two-digit number \\( ab \\), where \\( a \\) is the tens digit and \\( b \\) is the units digit. This means John's age can be expressed as \\( 10a + b \\).\nWhen we reverse the digits, we obtain his father's age, represented as \\( ba \\), which can be expressed as \\( 10b + a \\).\nAccording to the problem, we have the following conditions:\n1. The positive difference between their ages is 27 years:\n   \\[\n   |(10b + a) - (10a + b)| = 27\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this equation gives:\n   \\[\n   |9b - 9a| = 27 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad |b - a| = 3\n   \\]\n2. The sum of the digits in each age is 5:\n   \\[\n   a + b = 5\n   \\]\nNow we have the two equations:\n1. \\( |b - a| = 3 \\)\n2. \\( a + b = 5 \\)\nLet's solve for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n### Case 1: \\( b - a = 3 \\)\nFrom this equation, we can express \\( b \\) in terms of \\( a \\):\n\\[\nb = a + 3\n\\]\nSubstituting this into the second equation:\n\\[\na + (a + 3) = 5 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 2a + 3 = 5 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 2a = 2 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad a = 1\n\\]\nNow substituting \\( a \\) back into the equation for \\( b \\):\n\\[\nb = 1 + 3 = 4\n\\]\nThus, John\u2019s age \\( (10a + b) = 10(1) + 4 = 14 \\) and his father\u2019s age \\( (10b + a) = 10(4) + 1 = 41 \\).\n### Verify:\n1. The ages are 14 and 41.\n2. The positive difference is:\n   \\[\n   |41 - 14| = 27\n   \\]\n   which is correct.\n3. The sum of the digits in John's age:\n   \\[\n   1 + 4 = 5\n   \\]\n   and sum of the digits in father's age:\n   \\[\n   4 + 1 = 5\n   \\]\n   which also matches.\n### Case 2: \\( a - b = 3 \\)\nFrom this equation, we can express \\( a \\) in terms of \\( b \\):\n\\[\na = b + 3\n\\]\nSubstituting this into the second equation:\n\\[\n(b + 3) + b = 5 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 2b + 3 = 5 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 2b = 2 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad b = 1\n\\]\nNow substituting \\( b \\) back into the equation for \\( a \\):\n\\[\na = 1 + 3 = 4\n\\]\nThus, John's age \\( (10a + b) = 10(4) + 1 = 41 \\) and his father\u2019s age \\( (10b + a) = 10(1) + 4 = 14 \\).\n### Final Check:\nThe ages computed in this case do not satisfy the positive difference condition as \\( |14 - 41| = 27 \\) becomes incorrect, as it leads to John's age being incorrectly calculated.\nOnly the first case gives valid ages. Therefore John's father's age is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{41}\n\\]",
        "Let's denote John's age as \\( AB \\), which represents a two-digit number where \\( A \\) is the tens digit and \\( B \\) is the units digit. Consequently, John's age can be expressed as:\n\\[\n10A + B\n\\]\nReversing the digits gives us John's father's age, which can be represented as \\( BA \\) or:\n\\[\n10B + A\n\\]\nBased on the problem, we know two things:\n1. The positive difference between their ages is 27 years:\n\\[\n|(10A + B) - (10B + A)| = 27\n\\]\nThis can be simplified into two cases:\n- Case 1: \\( (10A + B) - (10B + A) = 27 \\)\n- Case 2: \\( (10B + A) - (10A + B) = 27 \\)\nLet's simplify Case 1:\n\\[\n10A + B - 10B - A = 27\n\\]\n\\[\n9A - 9B = 27\n\\]\n\\[\nA - B = 3 \\quad \\text{(1)}\n\\]\nNow for Case 2:\n\\[\n10B + A - 10A - B = 27\n\\]\n\\[\n9B - 9A = 27\n\\]\n\\[\nB - A = 3 \\quad \\text{(2)}\n\\]\nFrom equations (1) and (2), the scenario of (1) leads us to:\n\\[\nA = B + 3\n\\]\nIn contrast, (2) gives:\n\\[\nA = B - 3\n\\]\nNext, we can check for permissible values of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) based on the second condition. The sum of the digits of each age needs to equal 5:\n\\[\nA + B = 5 \\quad \\text{(3)}\n\\]\nNow, substituting both potential values for \\( A \\) from equations (1) and (2) into equation (3):\n1.

However, since we want John's father's age, we conclude that:\n\\[\n\\text{John's father's age} = 41\n\\]\nThus, the number of years in John's father's age is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{41}\n\\]",

We know that the positive difference between their ages is 27 years. Therefore, `f` = `j` + 27.\n3. We also know that the sum of the digits in each age is 5. Therefore, the sum of the digits of `j` is 5, and the sum of the digits of `f` is also 5.\n4. Let's break down the digits of John's age into individual digits:\n   * `j` has a number of digits equal to the number of digits required to make the sum of the digits 5, which is a odd number.\n   * The remaining inequality is `f` has a digit less than the number of digits total to make the sum of the digits 5.\n5.

Since the sum of the digits in their ages is given to be 5, this means that one of their ages must be a 5 digit number. But since the digits of 6 have already been used, the remaining digit of the number6 would be 9. But 9 is even, so the remaining digit must be odd. So, the remaining digit must be 7.\nTherefore, the number of years in John's father's age is 6 + 7 = <<6+7=13>>13 years. Answer: \\boxed{13}.",
        "\nLet John's age be $10a + b$ and his father's age be $100b + a$. We know that the sum of the digits in each age is 5, thus we have $a + b = 5$.\nNext, we know that the difference between their ages is 27. Therefore we have $(100b + a) - (10a + b) = 27$. We simplify to get $99b - 9a = 27$.\nBoth equations seem to be contradictory since we can't have negative digits for those variables. This suggests us to\u5c49 strong logic and reasoning details into the Design which we think GMAT will bring.\nHowever, one possible way is to get $59b + 5a = 87$ by multiplying each side of the first equation and get $1100b + 5b + a = 50b + 5a + 5a = 110a + 5b = 87.$ Then we subtract 5 from each side: $109b = 82.$ The BRUTE has that $b=1, a=8$ but we made a mistake in our reversal and $\u662f\u4e00\u540d\u6570\u5b66\u9898 Peng your brakes.

Therefore, \\begin{align*}\nj &= f - 27 \\\\\nf &= 27 - 5j \\\\\nf &= 13 - j.\n\\end{align*} Therefore, $13 - j - 1 - (13 - j) = 27$, which means $j = 14$.try it",

That means $j = -4$.\nPlugging this value into the equation $f - j = 27$, we can solve for $f$:\n$f - (-4) = 27$\n$f + 4 = 27$\n$f = 23$\nSo, John's father's age is $\\boxed{23}$ years.",
        " To find the number of years in John's father's age, we first need to determine the possible ages for each person. Since the sum of the digits in each age is 5, we can start by finding the two-digit combinations whose sums are 5: 14 and 9. \nFor the case of John's age being 14, then John's father's age would be 9 + 27 = 36. \nFor the case of John's age being 9, then his father's age would be 4 + 27 = 31. \nTherefore, the two possible ages for John's father are 36 and 31. \nSince the positive difference between their ages is 27 years, we can determine that John's father's age is 36.

        " \nWe have two heavy hints. Since the bassinet is 37 years old, the highest count for a $10$ place number is $7$. Therefore, the maximum number of $10$ place numbers in both ages must be $7$ for the resolutions of their ages. \nSince the difference between their ages is $27$ years, the resolution of their ages must be $27$ or less. \nLet each age be counted as $x$ and $y$ where $x$ is the first digit of the number found above $7$ (for example, if the maximum of the ages was $77$, then $x=7$) and $y$ is $9-x$. These would be used to correctly reflect the ordering of the numbers due to the two heavy hints given.\nIf we analyze each case carefully, we will find that their ages must be $16$ (4-6 with 86 came up) and $26$ (9-4 with 76 came up). Both Curry and his father must have been $26$ years old. If Curry was $16$ years old, their ages would be $61$ ($6+1=7+0$). $2561$ does not make sense, so Curry must be $26$. Therefore, John's father is $26$.",

        "\n#### Steps:\n1. Let's represent John's age with the number of digits in his age represented by \"d\". Therefore, John's age can be represented as 10^d.\n2. Let's represent John's father's age with the number of digits in his age represented by \"f\". Therefore, John's father's age can be represented as 10^f.\n3. The positive difference between their ages is 27 years. Therefore, (10^f)-(10^d) = 27\n4. The sum of the digits in each age is 5. Therefore, (d+1) + (f+1) = 5\n5. To find the value of f, we can substitute (f+1) in (d+1) = 5 to find the value of d and then f.\n6. Dividing the sum of the digits in each age by the number of digits, (d+1) / (f+1) = 5, will give us the value of f.\n7. We can substitute this value of f back into the equation (10^f)-(10^d) = 27 to find the value of d.\n8. Once we have d and f, we can calculate John's father's age by 10^f.\n9. Finally, we can find the difference between John's age and his father's age to answer the question.\n#### Solution:\n10. d = (5-1) * 1 + 1 = 4\n11. f = 5-d = 5-4 = 1\n12. John's father's age = 10^f = 10^1 = 10\n13. John's age = 10^d = 10^4 = 10000\n14. Difference between John's age and his father's age = John's age - John's father's age = 10000 - 10 = <<10000-10=9990>>9990\n15. Answer: John's father's age is 9990 years.",
