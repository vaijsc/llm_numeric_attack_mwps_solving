        "\nTo find the sum of five consecutive integers, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.\n### Explanation:\nThe sum of an arithmetic series is given by the formula:\nsum = (n/2)(first term + last term)\nIn this case, there are 5 consecutive integers, so the first term is x and the last term is x + 4.\nUsing the formula, we can write the equation as:\n5 = (1/2)(x + x + 4)\nSimplifying the equation, we have:\n5 = (1/2)(2x + 4)\nMultiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction, we get:\n10 = 2x + 4\nSubtracting 4 from both sides, we have:\n6 = 2x\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\nx = 3\nSo the first term is 3 and the last term is 3 + 4 = 7.\n### Solution:\nThe five consecutive integers are 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.\nTo find the product of these integers, we can multiply them together:\n3 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 7 = 120\nTherefore, the product of the five integers is 120.",
        " \n#### Steps:\n1. Let's assume the first of the five consecutive integers is 'x'.\n2. The next five consecutive integers will be 'x+1', 'x+2', 'x+3', 'x+4', and 'x+5'.\n3. The sum of these five integers is given as 5. So, we can write the equation as:\nx + (x+1) + (x+2) + (x+3) + (x+4) = 5\n4. Simplifying this equation, we get:\n5x + 10 = 5\n5. Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get:\n5x = -5\n6. Dividing both sides by 5, we get:\nx = -1\n7.
