        " To solve this expression, we need to break it down into smaller steps. First, let's simplify the numerator of the first fraction: $7+8+9=24$.

        " To find the value of the expression, we can start by asking what the order of operations is.\nThe order of operations is PEMDAS/BODMAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right).

Notice that the numerator of the first fraction has a factor of $7$ that does not appear in the denominator of the second fraction. Similarly, the denominator of the second fraction also has a factor of $24$ that does not appear in the numerator of the first fraction. Therefore, these two factors can be canceled out: $$\\frac{24}{10}\\cdot\\frac{27}{24} = \\frac{27}{10}\\cdot\\frac{3}{4}.$$  We can now perform the multiplication: $$27\\cdot\\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{81}{4}\\cdot\\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{243}{16}.$$ Our final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{243}{16}}$."
