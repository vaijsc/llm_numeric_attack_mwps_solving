        "\n#### Party member 1:\n\u201cTo find the point of intersection of the line $y=2x-10$ and the line passing through $(7,8)$ and $(9,0)$, we can set up a system of equations. The equation of the first line is $y=2x-10$. The line passing through $(7,8)$ and $(9,0)$ can be represented as $y-8=2(x-7)$ and $y-0=2(x-9)$. We can then solve this system to find the coordinates of the point of intersection, $(a,b)$. The point of intersection is the point where the two lines intersect, so $a$ and $b$ are the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of that point respectively.From the first equation of the line passing through $(7,8)$ and $(9,0)$, we have $y-8=2(x-7)$. This simplifies to $y=2x-15$.\nTo find the point of intersection, we equate this equation to the equation of the first line $y=2x-10$:\n\\begin{align*}2x-10&=2x-15 \\end{align*}\nSolving this equation, we find that $x=10$ is the point of intersection.

Let's substitute $y=2x-10$ into the equation of the line passing through $(7,8)$ and $(9,0)$.\n$2x-10=2(x1)-10$\n$2x-10=2x-20$\n$-10= -20$\nThis is a contradiction and we can say that the lines do not intersect. Hence, there is no point of intersection and $a+b=\\boxed{0}$.",
        " \nLet's find the equation of the line passing through $(7, 8)$ and $(9, 0)$.\nSince two points determine a line, we can use the two given points to find the slope of the line. The slope ($m$) is given by:\n$m=\\frac{0-8}{9-7}=\\frac{-8}{2}=-4$\nNow that we have the slope, we can write the equation of a line in slope-intercept form: $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.\nUsing the point-slope form, we can substitute in one of the given points, such as $(7, 8)$, into the equation to solve for $b$:\n$8 = -4(7) + b$\n$8 = -28 + b$\n$b = 36$\nSo the equation of the line is $y = -4x + 36$.\nTo find the point of intersection between the two lines, we can set the two equations equal to each other and solve for $x$:\n$2x-10 = -4x + 36$\n$6x = 46$\n$x = \\frac{46}{6} = 7$\nSubstituting this value of $x$ back into either equation, such as the first one, we can solve for $y$:\n$y = 2(7) - 10 = 14 - 10 = 4$\nSo the point of intersection is $(7, 4)$.\nFinally, we can compute $a+b$:\n$a+b = 7 + 4 = 11$\nTherefore, $a+b = \\boxed{11}$.",
        " Because the multiplicities of $x$ and $y$ are the same, the main line has to pass through $(7/2,4)$ from some slope.  The parameterization of the line through $(7,8)$ and $(9,0)$ is $y-4=5(x-7)$ or $y=-5x+35$.  When we encounter that point on the main line, we will find a point of intersection,\u5956\u5b66\u91d1\u5982\u4e0b:\n$$2x-10=-5x+35.$$ sponsors: \u201c\u6709\u6240\u4e0d\u4e3a\u201d"
