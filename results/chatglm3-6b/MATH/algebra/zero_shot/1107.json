Although this method may seems\u8431 to be difficult when dealing with a\u592a\u5927\u7684 equation or complex roots, let's revisit the first equation, and $(A+B)x + A-B = x^2+3x-2$._. expand $(A+B)x + A-B$ using the distributive property \\[ax+b = ((a+b)x + (a-b inspect x)$\nFor $x=1$,\u7bc7\u6587\u7ae0\u5b9a\u7f6a $(A+B) + A-B = 1 + 3 - 2$, \u56e0\u6b64 $A+B=2$\nFor $x=-1$,\u6587\u7ae0\u5b9a\u7f6a $(A+B)(-1) + A-B = (-1) + 3 - 2$, \u56e0\u6b64 $A-B=-2$.

Let's try to get rid of the denominators by multiplying both sides of the equation by common denominators $x-1$ and $x+1$. This gives us\n\\[A(x+1)+B(x-1)=(x+2)(x-1).\\]\nSimplifying the right side equation, we have $(x^2-1)=x^2 \\Rightarrow$ $(x-1)=x \\Rightarrow$ $1=1.$  So our equation is now\n\\[A(x+1)+B(x-1)=1.\\]\nNow we multiply both sides by $x$ (to get rid of the factor on the left-hand side that makes the equation hard to solve) to get\n\\[A(x^2+x)+B(x^2-x)=x.\\]\nIsolating $x$ in terms of $x^2+x$, we have $x^2+x=1$. Rearranging this equation gives $x^2+x-1=0$, which factors as $(x+1)(x-1)=0$. So we solve for $x$, which gives $x=-1$ and $x=1$. We know $x$ can't be equal to 1 because that would make the equation undefined for $\\frac A{x-1}$, so we discard $x=1$. \nSo now the equation is \\[x^2+x-1=0.\\] By the quadratic formula,\n\\[x=\\frac{-1\\pm\\sqrt{1+4}}{2}=\\frac{-1\\pm\\sqrt5}{2}.\\] Let's find out what each value does when plugged back in to $A(x+1)+B(x-1)=1$.

Therefore, the minimum and maximum values for $A+B$ are 2 and 4-2 = 2+2 = 4, respectively.\nSince $A+B=x+2$, we can find the values of $A$ and $B$ by considering the minimum and maximum values of $x+1$ separately.\nFor $x+1=2$, we have $A+B=2$.

The only way to Split this\u56fd\u5bb6 into either solution set is that $A=B=2$. Therefore, $A=3$ and $B=2$.\nTherefore, $A-B=3-2=\\boxed{1}$.\nAlternatively,\nWe can do this process at the same time.  Multiplying both sides of $\\frac{"
