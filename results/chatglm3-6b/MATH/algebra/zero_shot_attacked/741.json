        " To find the $y$-coordinate of the $y$-intercept, we need to find the point where the line intersects the $y$-axis, which means the $x$-coordinate is $0$. Therefore, we need to determine the equation of the line in slope-intercept form, $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the $y$-intercept. Since the line passes through the point $(6,-3)$, we have that the point satisfies the equation: $-3=m(6)+blist: \n\\begin{align*}\n-3 &= \\frac12(6)+b \\\\\n-3&=\\frac32+b \\\\\nb&=-\\frac52\\\\\n\\end{align*}Now we can write the equation of the line in point-slope form: $y-y_1=m(x-x_1)$, where $(x_1, y_1)$ is the point $(6,-3)$:  \\begin{align*}\ny-\\left(-3\\right) &= \\frac12(x-(6)) \\\\\ny+3 &= \\frac12(x-6) \\\\\ny &= \\frac12x - 3\n\\end{align*}To find the $y$-coordinate of the $y$-intercept, we need to find the value of $y$ when $x = 0$. Thus, we plug $x=0$ into a previously written answer for finding slope $m$:  \\begin{align*}\ny &= \\frac12(0)- 3 \\\\\ny&=-3\n\\end{align*}Since the answer choices given were\u52c3\u62c9\u5c3c Once the equation of the line is written in slope-intercept form, finding the $y$-coordinate of the $y$-intercept is easy: the answer is $\\boxed{-3}$.",
        " To find the $y$-coordinate of the $y$-intercept of the line that passes through the point $(6,-3)$, we can use the point-slope form of a line. The point-slope form is given by $y-y_1=m(x-x_1)$, where $(x_1,y_1)$ is a point on the line and $m$ is the slope of the line.\nIn this case, the point $(6,-3)$ is on the line, and the slope $m=\\frac{1}{2}$. Plugging in these values into the point-slope form, we get:\n$y-(-3)= \\frac{1}{2}(x-6)$\nSimplifying the left side gives:\n$y+3= \\frac{1}{2}x-3$\nMultiplying both sides by 2 gives:\n$2y+6= x-3$\nRearranging the terms gives:\n$x-2y-9=0$\nThis equation represents the line in point-slope form. To find the slope of a straight line, we can take the derivative of this linear equation. Taking the derivative gives us the slope at any point on the line. In this case, we can find the slope at the $y$-intercept, which is when $x=0$:\n$\\frac{d}{dx}(-2y-9)=2$\nSimplifying, we get:\n$-2y'-9=0$\nDividing both sides by -2 gives:\n$y'+4.5=0$\nSubtracting 4.5 from both sides gives:\n$y'=-4.5$\nTaking the inverse of the derivative, we find:\n$y=-4.5$\nSo at the $y$-intercept, the $y$-coordinate is $y=\\boxed{-4.5}$.",
        " To find the $y$-coordinate of the $y$-intercept, we first need to find the equation of the line. The equation of a line can be written in point-slope form as $y-y_1=m(x-x_1)$, where $(x_1, y_1)$ is a point on the line and $m$ is the slope. We can plug in the coordinates of the given point into the equation to find the slope:\n$(6,-3)-(0, 0)= \\frac{1}{2} (x-0)$\n$(6,-3)-(0, 0)= (x, x)$\n$6-0= xx$\n$x = 6$\nSo the equation of the line in point-slope form is $y-(-3)= \\frac{1}{2}(x-6)$.\nTo convert this into the slope-intercept form $y = mx + b$, we join the\u6349\u66e6\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\uff1a\n$y + 3 = \\frac{1}{2} x,$\n\u4f01\u9e45\u5f97\uff1a\n$2y + 6 = x.$\nTo find the $y$-coordinate of the $y$-intercept, we set $x = 0$ and solve for $y$:\n$2y + 6 = 0$\n$2y = -6$\n$y = -3$\nSo the $y$-coordinate of the $y$-intercept is $\\boxed{-3}$.",
        " To find the slope of the line passing through two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$, we use the formula:\n\\[m = \\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}. \\]\nIn this case, the two points are $(6, -3)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$, so the slope $m$ is $\\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1} = \\frac{-3-\\textcolor{black}{(y_2)}}{x_2-6} = \\frac{\\textcolor{black}{(y_2)-(-3)}}{x_2-6},$ and the value of $y_2$ is positive, so we can simplify the expression as:\n\\[m = \\frac{(y_2)-(-3)}{x_2-6} = \\frac{y_2+3}{x_2-6}, \\quad \\text{where} \\quad -6 \\neq 0. \\]\nThis is the slope of the line, which is $\\frac12$ in this case. Therefore,  \\[\\frac{y_2+3}{x_2-6} = \\frac{1}{2}.\\] Solving this equation for $y_2$ in the next step ensures us that the value of $y_2$ is the $y$-coordinate of the $y$-intercept, or $0$.",
