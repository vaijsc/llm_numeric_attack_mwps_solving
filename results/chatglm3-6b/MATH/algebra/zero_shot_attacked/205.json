        " To solve this, let's assume the two numbers are x and y. According to the given information, we can establish the following equations: \nx * y = 24\nx^2 + y^2 = 83\nNow, let's find the square of their difference, which is (x - y)^2. \nExpanding the square of their difference, we get:\n(x - y)^2 = x^2 - 2xy + y^2\nNow, we need to substitute the values of x^2 + y^2 from the second equation into the expanded form of (x - y)^2:\n(x - y)^2 = 83 - 2xy\nTo find the value of xy, we can square the equation x * y = 24:\nxy = 24^2 / x^2\nSubstituting the value of xy into the equation for (x - y)^2, we have:\n(x - y)^2 = 83 - 2(24^2 / x^2)\nNow, we need to solve for x and y. However, without additional information or constraints, there can be multiple solutions for x and y. \nTherefore, the square of their difference can be any value depending on the values of x and y that satisfy both equations.\n#### 83\nThe answer is: 83",

        "\nLet the two numbers be $x$ and $y$. We have the following system of equations:\n1. $xy = 24$ (Equation 1: Product of the numbers)\n2. $x^2 + y^2 = 83$ (Equation 2: Sum of the squares of the numbers)\nTo find the square of their difference, which is $(x-y)^2$, we need to find the values of $x$ and $y$.\nWe can solve this system of equations by substitution or elimination. Here, we'll use the elimination method by multiplying Equation 1 by 1 and Equation 2 by -1, and then adding the two equations to eliminate the $y$ term:\n$x(x-y) + (-y)(x-y) = 24 + 83$\nExpanding the equation:\n$(x^2 - xy + y^2) + (-xy + xy) = 24 + 83$\nSimplifying and combining like terms:\n$x^2 + y^2 = 107$\nHowever, this equation is not helpful in determining the values of $x$ and $y$, since $x^2$ and $y^2$ are non-zero and equal to 107.\nSwitchingdirection, let's think about another possible method. We want to find $(x-y)^2$, which means we need to determine the values of $x$ and $y$ such that $(x-y)^2 = 24+83$.\nAdding 36 to both sides of the equation and taking the square root:\n$(x-y)^2 + 36 = 109$\noral:\n$(x-y)^2 = 109 - 36$\n$x-y = \\pm \\sqrt{73}$\nTherefore, the difference between the two numbers is $\\sqrt{73}$.
