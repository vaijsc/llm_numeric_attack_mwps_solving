        " To make a profit, the company should sell enough widgets to earn more than \\$1200.\nLet $w$ be the number of widgets.  If the company sells $w$ widgets, it earns $w \\times \\$2.75$, and it costs $w \\times \\$0.50$, which means it makes a profit of $\\$2.75 - \\$0.50 = \\$2.25$ per widget.  We set up the inequality \\[w(2.25-\\frac12)=\\frac12(w)(2.25^{2.25-1}-1)\\] and simplify to \\[0.5\\cdot w^2 - w - w(2.25^{2.25-1}-1)=0.\\]\nSubstituting $2.25^{2.25-1}=2.25$ gives $0.5w^2 -w-w(2.25 - 1) = 0.$ Since the least number of widgets the company needs to sell is its smallest positive root (the smaller root is just 0), we just need to find the\u8bd5\u9a8c\u533a\u95f4\u7684\u589e\u51cf\u60c5\u51b5.\nWe know that from isolation point, $\\Re(0.5w^2-w)=0,$ and solving for $w$, using the quadratic formula gives \\[w=\\frac{-(-1)\\pm\\sqrt{(-1)^2-4(.5)(-1)}}{2(.5)} = \\frac{1\\pm\\sqrt{5}}{.5}.\\]  One value of $\\frac 1 \\pm \\sqrt 5$ is greater that 1.
