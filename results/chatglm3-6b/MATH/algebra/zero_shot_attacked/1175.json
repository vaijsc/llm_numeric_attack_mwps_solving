        " \nWe know that a and b are consecutive integers and a < b. We also know that the sum of -8a and 3b equals -23. Since a is less than b, we can conclude that -8a is less than -8b. Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as -3b = 23 - 8a.\nSince a and b are consecutive integers, we know that b = a + 1. Substituting this into the equation, we get -3(a + 1) = 23 - 8a.\nExpanding the equation, we get -3a - 3 = 23 - 8a.

To do this, we can add 8a to both sides of the equation.\nAfter adding 8a to both sides of the equation, we will have -8a + 8a + 3b = -23 + 8a.\nSimplifying the left side of the equation, we have 3b = -23 + 8a.\nSince 3b is the result of multiplying b by 3, and -23 is equal to -8a + 23 - 8a, we can rewrite 3b = -23 + 8a as 3b = -8a + 23.\nNow let's isolate a by dividing both sides of the equation by 3:\n3b = -8a + 23  \nb = (-8a + 23)/3\nSince a and b are consecutive integers, the value of b must be an integer.
