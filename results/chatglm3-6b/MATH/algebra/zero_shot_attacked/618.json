        "\nLet's use variables to solve the problem. \nLet 'c' represent the number of clowns and 'h' represent the number of horses. \nWe know that clowns have 2 legs and horses have 4 legs.\nWe also know that there are a total of 30 legs and 50 heads.\nSo, the equation can be expressed as:\n2c + 4h = 30 \nand\nc + h = 50 \nTo solve this system of equations, we need to eliminate one variable. We can use substitution. \nFrom the second equation, we can substitute for 'c' in terms of 'h':\nc = 50 - h \nNow we can substitute this expression into the first equation:\n2(50 - h) + 4h = 30 \ndistribute and simplify the equation:\n100 - 2h + 4h = 30 \ncombine like terms:\n2h = 70 \ndivide by 2:\nh = 35 \nSo, you saw 35 horses in the parade.",
        "\nLet's start by idx=0 and total heads=0. Let's also assume x=0 which represents the number of horses you saw in the parade.\nThe total number of legs would then be (30 - total heads and legs of clowns) = (30 - 50) = -20. However, negative counts don't make sense in this context so we know that x (number of horses) must be 0.\nSo, in the end, you didn't see any horses in the parade.",
        "\nLet's say the number of clowns is C and the number of horses is H.\nEach clown has 2 legs and one head, so the total number of legs from the clowns is 2C.\nEach horse has 4 legs and one head, so the total number of legs from the horses is 4H.\nWe know that the total number of legs is 30, so we can write an equation- 2C + 4H = 30.\nWe also know that the total number of heads is 50, so we can write another equation- C + H = 50.\nTo solve this system of equations, we can use substitution or elimination method.\nLet's use the elimination method.\nMultiply the first equation by 1 and the second equation by -2.\nBy adding the two equations, we can eliminate the C variable- (2C + 4H) + (-2C - 2H) = 30 - 10\nThis simplifies to- 2H = 20\nDivide both sides by 2 to solve for H.\nH = 10\nSo, you saw 10 horses in the parade.",
        "\nLet's assume the number of clowns is x and the number of horses is y.\nFrom the given information, we can write two equations:\nx + y = the total number of heads  (1)\n2x + 4y = the total number of legs  (2)\nSince the number of clowns and horses combined is 50, we have:\nx + y = 50   (3)\nRegarding the legs, we know that each clown has 2 legs and each horse has 4. Therefore, 2x + 4y = 2(x + y), which simplifies to 2x + 4y = 2x + 2y.\nThus, 2y = 2y, which is always true and does not provide any valuable information.\nHowever, if we substitute x = 50 - y from equation (3) into equation (2), we can solve for y.\n2(50 - y) + 4y = 2(x + y)\n100 - 2y + 4y = 100 - y + y\n2y = y\ny = 0\nThis solution indicates that there were no horses in the parade.",
        "\nLet's represent the number of clowns as C and the number of horses as H.\nWe know that each clown has 2 legs and each horse has 4 legs, so the total number of legs is 2C + 4H.\nWe also know that each clown and each horse has a head, so the total number of heads is C + H.\nWe are given that the total number of legs is 30 and the total number of heads is 50, so we can set up the following equations:\n2C + 4H = 30\nC + H = 50\nTo solve these equations, we can combine them into a single equation:\n3C + 3H = 30 + 50\n3C + 3H = 80\nNow, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3 to simplify:\nC + H = 26.67\nSince the number of clowns and horses cannot be a decimal, we know that there must be some positive integers C and H that satisfy the equation.\nLooking back at the first equation, we can see that the coefficient of C is already 2, which means that we cannot add more than 2 clowns.\nWe can try different values for C and solve for H:\nIf C = 2, then 2C + 4H = 2(2) + 4H = 4 + 4H.\nIf C = 1, then 2C + 4H = 2(1) + 4H = 2 + 4H.\nIf C = 0, then 2C + 4H = 2(0) + 4H = 0 + 4H = 4H.\nSolving for H in each case:\nFor C = 2, H = 18.\nFor C = 1, H = 14.\nFor C = 0, H = 0.\nWe are looking for the value of H that gives us a total of 50 heads, so the answer is H = 14.\nThe number of horses you saw in the parade is 14.\n#### 14\nThe answer is: 14",
        "\nTo solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's assume the number of clowns is \"x\" and the number of horses is \"y\". \nFrom the given information, we know that each clown has 2 legs and each horse has 4 legs. So, the total number of legs can be expressed as:\n2x + 4y = 30   (Equation 1: representing the total number of legs)\nWe also know that there are 50 heads in the parade. Since a clown has 1 head and a horse has 1 head, we can write:\nx + y = 50   (Equation 2: representing the total number of heads)\nNow we have a system of two linear equations with two variables. We can solve this system to find the values of x and y, which represent the number of clowns and horses in the parade, respectively. \nTo solve this system of equations, we can multiply Equation 2 by 2 to eliminate the x term:\n2(x + y) = 2(50)\n2x + 2y = 100\nNow we combine Equation 1 and the modified Equation 2:\n2x + 4y = 30\n2x + 2y = 100\nSubtracting the second equation from the first equation:\n4y - 2y = 30 - 100\n2y = 70\nDividing both sides of the equation by 2:\ny = 70 / 2\ny = 35\nSo, there were 35 horses in the parade.",
        "\nLet's use algebra to solve the problem. Let \u201cx\u201d be the number of clowns and \u201cy\u201d be the number of horses.\nWe know that each clown has 2 legs and each horse has 4 legs, which gives us a total of 30 legs. So we can write the first equation as:\n2x + 4y = 30\nWe also know that there are 50 heads in total, so the second equation will be:\nx + y = 50\nNow let\u2019s solve this system of equations. We can multiply the second equation by 2, which will give us:\n2x + 2y = 100\nWe can subtract the first equation from this new one, which will eliminate x:\n2x + 2y = 100\n2x + 4y - (2x + 4y) = 100 - 30\n0 = 70\nThis last equation is not possible, which means there is no solution to the system of equations. This means that the number of clowns and horses could be 30-0 = 30 and 50-0 = 50 or any combination that equals to 50 heads.\nSo the answer is: 50.",
        "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the value of x, which represents the number of horses in the parade.\nWe know that each horse has 4 legs and 1 head.\nLet's break down the information given:\nNumber of legs: 30\nNumber of heads: 50\nNumber of horses: x\nFrom this information, we can set up the equation:\nNumber of legs per horse * Number of horses + Number of heads = Total number of legs and heads\n4x + 50 = 30\nLet's simplify and solve for x:\n4x = 30 - 50\n4x = -20\nTo isolate x, we divide both sides of the equation by 4:\nx = -20 / 4\nx = -5\nThe value of x is -5.\nHowever, since we are dealing with the number of horses in a parade, x cannot be negative.

        "\nLet's use algebra to solve the problem. Let's say the number of clowns is C and the number of horses is H.\nBased on the given information, we can create the following equations:\nC + H = number of heads (50)\n2C + 4H = number of legs (30)\nLet's solve for H:\n1. Subtract 2C from both sides and divide the result by 2: H = (30-2C)/2\n2. Multiply the result by 2: 2H = 30-2C\n3. Add 2C to both sides: 2H+2C = 30\n4. Divide the result by 2: H+C = 15\nSince we know that the number of heads is 50, we can substitute that value into the equation: H + C = 50\nNow we have a system of equations:\nH + C = 50\nH + C = 15\nSubtract the second equation from the first one: 0 = 35\nThis means that the system of equations has no solution, which means there's an error in the given information or the way the problem is worded.",

Each clown has 2 legs and each horse has 4 legs.\nFrom the given information, we can say:\n2C + 4H = 30 (since a clown has 2 legs and a horse has 4 legs, we have to account for the difference in the number of legs per Conservative)\nNext, we know that the total number of heads in the parade is 50 and Since each clown has 1 head and each horse has 1 head, we can write this as:\nC + H = 50\nWe need to solve for C and H using these two equations.\nTo eliminate C from both equations, we can multiply the first equation by 1 and the second by 2. This does not change the value of the equations but it\u5ba0\u7269 C out of the second equation so we can solve for C later.\nSo, 2(2C + 4H) = 2(30) and 2(C + H) = 2(50)\n4C + 8H = 60 and C + H = 50\nMultiplying the second equation by -1 we get H = 50 - C\nAnd substituting H in the first equation we get 4C + 8(50 - C) = 60\n => 4C + 400 - 8C = 60\n => -4C = -340\n => C = 85\nSo, There were 85 clowns in the parade.\nNow, using the equation H = 50 - C, we can find the number of horses.\nH = 50 - 85\nH = -35\nThis solution does not make sense because the number of horses cannot be negative.
