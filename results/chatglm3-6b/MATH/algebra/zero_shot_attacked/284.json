        "\nTo rewrite $-4x^2 + 8x + 5$ in the form $a(x - h)^2 + k$, we want to complete the square.  The general form of a quadratic expression that can be written in the form $a(x - h)^2 + k$ is $a(x - h)^2 + k = a(x^2 - 2hx + h^2) + k$.  Comparing this with $-4x^2 + 8x + 5$, we want to find an $a$ such that multiplying $x^2$ gives $-4x^2$, multiplying $hx$ gives $8hx$, and multiplying $h^2$ gives $4h^2$.  Thus,\u6709\u591a\u7ec4 $h$ and $a$ such as $-h$ and $-4$, $-h$ and 3,  and so on that can link the quadratic with the desired form.  For example, if one chooses $-h = 4$ and $a = -1$, then $-4x^2 + 8x + 5$ can be written in the form of $ -1(x - 4)^2 + 21$.  Here, $k = 21$.\n### Explanation\nSo to write $-4x^2 + 8x + 5$ in the form $a(x - h)^2 + k$, the value of $k$ is $-4h^2 + 21$.",
        " To express $-4x^2 + 8x + 5$ in the form $a(x - h)^2 + k$, we need to complete the square.\nFirst, we take the coefficient of the $x^2$ term, which is $-4$, and divide it by the coefficient of the $x$ term, which is $-8$. This gives us $\\frac{-4}{-8} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nNext, we square $\\frac{1}{2}$ to get $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4}$.\nTo get our expression quadratic into the form $a(x - h)^2 + k$, we need to add and subtract this squared term inside the parentheses. This gives us:\n$-4x^2 + 8x + 5 = -4x^2 + 8x + \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{4} + 5$\nSimplifying, we have:\n$-4x^2 + 8x + \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} + 5 = -4x^2 + 8x + 4 + 5$\nCombining the like terms, we get:\n$-4x^2 + 8x + 4 + 5 = -4x^2 + 8x + 9$\nComparing this with the form $a(x - h)^2 + k$, we can see that $k = \\boxed{9}$.\n#### 9\nThe answer is: 9",
        " To express $-4x^2 + 8x + 5$ in the form $a(x + h)^2 + k$, we need to complete the square.\nThe topic of completing the square comes up a lot in working with quadratic equations. When we process a quadratic expression, we're\u5b9e\u8d28ively looking for a way to rewrite it so that it looks like the expansion of $(x - h)^2$. This is typically done by moving the constant term to the right-hand side of the equation, and grouping the $x$ terms in the middle. We can do this by dividing the first two terms and the last two terms of the quadratic expression by 2.\nSo let's divide the first two terms and the last two terms by 2 and rewrite the equation accordingly. $-4x^2 + 8x = -4(x^2 - 2x)$. The middle term is then $-2x$. We can now add and subtract the square of half the coefficient of the $x$ term.  Answer: $$\n\\begin{aligned} -4(x^2 - 2x) + 2 &= -4x^2 + 8x + 2 \\\\ &= \\boxed{2}. \\end{aligned}\n$$",

        " To express $-4x^2 + 8x + 5$ in the form $a(x - h)^2 + k$, we need to complete the square for the quadratic term $-4x^2$.\nThe square that matches the coefficient of $x^2$ is $(x - h)^2$, where $h$ is the height of the vertex.
