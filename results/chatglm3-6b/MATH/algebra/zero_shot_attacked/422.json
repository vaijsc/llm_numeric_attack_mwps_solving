        " To maximize the area of the garden, we need to determine the length of the rectangular garden. Since the fencing must entirely enclose the garden, the length of the garden plus the width of the garden must equal 250 feet. \nLet\u2019s use L to represent the length and W to represent the width of the garden. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\nL + W = 250\nSince we want to maximize the area, we will use the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is A = LxW.\nWe are given that the perimeter of the garden is 250 feet. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2L + 2W. Therefore, we have:\n2L + 2W = 250\nDividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get:\nL + W = 125\nNow we have a system of two linear equations with two variables. \nTo solve this system, we can use substitution, where we solve for one variable in terms of the other variable.\nFrom the first equation, we can solve for L:\nL = 125 - W\nNow substitute L in the equation for the area:\nA = (125 - W)(W)\nExpand the equation:\nA = 125W - W^2\nTo find the maximum area, we need to find the vertex of the parabola defined by the equation A = -W^2 + 125W.\nThe x-coordinate of the vertex can be found using the formula x = -b / (2a), where a and b are the coefficients of the quadratic equation in the form of ax^2 + bx + c.\nIn this case, a = -1 and b = 125.\nSubstituting these values into the formula, we get:\nx = -125 / (2 * -1) = 62.5\nNow that we have the x-coordinate of the vertex, we can find the y-coordinate by substituting this value into the equation for the area:\nA = - (62.5)^2 + 125(62.5)\n",
        " To find the maximum area of the garden, we need to determine its dimensions. Let's assume that the length of the garden is L feet and the width is W feet. \nThe perimeter of a rectangle is the sum of its dimensions, which is given by the formula P = 2L + 2W. \nGiven that the perimeter of the garden is 250 feet, we can set up the equation: 2L + 2W = 250.\nSimplifying the equation, we get: L + W = 125. \nTo maximize the area, we are trying to maximize the product of the length and width, which is given by the formula A = L * W.\nWe need to find the values of L and W that satisfy the equation L + W = 125 and maximize the product A.\nSince the length and width are interchangeable, we can solve the equation L + W = 125 for L in terms of W and substitute this expression into the formula for the area A.\nL = 125 - W.\nNow we can substitute this expression for L into the formula for the area A: A = (125 - W) * W.\nTo find the maximum value of A, we take the derivative of A with respect to W and set it equal to 0:\ndA/dW = 125.\nSolving for W, we get W = 125/2 = 62.5.\nSubstituting this value of W into the expression for L, we find L = 125 - 62.5 = 62.5.\nTherefore, the maximum area of the garden is A = L * W = 62.5 * 62.5 = 3906.25.\nThe maximum area of the garden is 3906.25 square feet.",

Let's denote the length of the garden as L and the width as W. We know that the perimeter of the garden is 250 feet. \nThe perimeter is equal to 2L + 2W. Since the perimeter is the total amount of fencing used, we can set up the equation: \n2L + 2W = 250. \nDividing both sides by 2, we get: \nL + W = 125. \nNow, to find the dimensions that will maximize the area while still using the most amount of fencing, we need to find the point on the unit square that has a perimeter of 125 when unrolled into a rectangle and calculated as per the above equation. Let's solve for L using the equation above: \nL = 125 - W. \nSo, the area of the garden is: \nArea = W*L = W(125 - W) = W^2 - W^2 = W.\nLet's substitute the value of W from the equation L + W = 125 in the above expression for area: \nArea = W. \nTo maximize the area, we need to find the value of W that will make L an integer. Let's consider the minimum and maximum possible integer values for L: 49 and max. When L = 49, the area will be: \nArea = 49. \nSo, the maximum area of the garden will be 49 square feet.",

In this case, the perimeter is given as 250 feet, so we can rearrange the formula to solve for the length of the rectangle: L = (250 - 2W) / 2.\nSince we want to maximize the area, we can take the derivative of the area with respect to W and set it equal to zero. The area is given by A = L \\* W, so we have:\ndA/dW = L\nSubstituting the expression for L, we get:\ndA/dW = ((250 - 2W) / 2)\nSetting dA/dW equal to zero and solving for W, we find that W = 62.5.\nSubstituting this value back into the expression for L, we get:\nL = (250 - 2(62.5)) / 2 = 56.25\nFinally, we can substitute these values for L and W into the expression for the area to find the maximum area:\nA = L \\* W = 56.25 \\* 62.5 = 3624.125\nTherefore, the maximum area of the garden is approximately 3624.125 square feet.",

        " Let the length of the garden be $l$ and the width of the garden be $w$. The fencing consists of $2l + 2w$ pieces of length $1$. Therefore, we have the inequality $2l + 2w \\geq 250 \\Longrightarrow l+w \\geq 125$. Since we maximize area for a given perimeter, we take successively increasing values of $w$ until we hit $l = 125 - w$. The maximum area is thus \\[\\frac{(125 - w)(w)}{2} = \\frac{125w - w^2}{2}.\\]We can then complete the square to get\n\\[\\frac{125w - w^2}{2} = \\frac{-w^2 + 125w}{2} =  -\\frac{[(w - 62)(w + 5)]}{2} = -(w - 62)(w + 5).\\]By AM-GM, since $w + 5 \\geq 2\\sqrt{w \\cdot 5} = 5\\sqrt{w}$,\n$\\{(w - 62)(w + 5)\\} \\leq \\left[ \\frac{w + 5 + 62}{2} \\right]^2 = 69^2$. Therefore, the maximum possible area is $-69^2$.\n2 of $125-w$ is equal to $69^2$ such that \\[2(125 - w) = 69^2\\]is true. Thus, $w = 21$, and the maximum area is $(125-21) \\cdot 21 = \\boxed{1590}$.",
