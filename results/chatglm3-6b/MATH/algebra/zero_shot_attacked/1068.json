        " To determine where the line crosses the y-axis, we need to find the point where the x-coordinate is 0, since at x = 0, the line will intersect the y-axis.\nThe formula for the equation of a line is y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.\nThe given equation is y = 4x + 6.\nTo find the slope, we need to rewrite the equation in slope-intercept form, y = 4x + 6 = 4x + 6.\nThe slope of the given line is 4.\nTo find the y-intercept, we can substitute x = 0 into the equation and solve for y:\ny = 4(0) + 6 = 6.\nTherefore, the equation of the line parallel to y = 4x + 6 and passing through (3, 12) is y = 4x + 6.\nTo find the point where this line crosses the y-axis, we need to set x = 0 in the equation and solve for y:\ny = 4(0) + 6 = 6.\nTherefore, the y-coordinate of the point where this line crosses the y-axis is 6.\nThe answer is: 6",

        " The point where a line crosses the $y$-axis has a $x$-coordinate of 0. So, we can substitute $x=0$ into the equation of the line to find the $y$-coordinate of the point. \nGiven that the line is parallel to $y = 4x + 6$, we know that the slope of the line is 4.
