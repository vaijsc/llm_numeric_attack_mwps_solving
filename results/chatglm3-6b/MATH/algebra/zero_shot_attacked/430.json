        " To find the points where the line intersects the $y$-axis, we need to find the points where the line passes through the $x$-coordinate of 0. Thus we simply need to check if $(0, y)$ is in the line. Our line is given by\n\\[(x, y) = (-5, 8) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad (x, y) = (-3, -1).\\]To express the point $(0, y)$ as a solution to the system, we write\n\\[\\begin{aligned} y &= 8 \\\\ y &= -1 \\end{aligned}.\\]In the first case, $(0,8)$ is a solution for both points, the second case $(0,-1)$ is a solution only for the second point, so the $y$-coordinate of the point where this line intersects the $y$-axis is $\\boxed{ 8}.$",

The point-slope form is given by:\n$y - y_1 = m(x - x_1),$ so the equation of this line is:\n$y - 8 = \\frac{1}{8}(x - (-5))$\nSimplifying, we get:\n$y - 8 = \\frac{1}{8}(x + 5)$\nFinally, we can rewrite this equation in slope-intercept form ($y = mx + b$), where $b$ represents the $y$-intercept. Solving for $y$ we get:\n$y = \\frac{1}{8}x + \\frac{5}{8}$\nThe $y$-intercept occurs when $x = 0$, so plugging in $x = 0$ into the equation, we find that:\n$y = \\frac{1}{8}(0) + \\frac{5}{8} = \\frac{5}{8}$\nSo the $y$-coordinate of the point where this line intersects the $y$-axis is $\\frac{5}{8}$.",

Since a line perpendicular to this line will have an equation of the form $y = mx-b$, we know that $b = -8$.\nThe line's equation is $y = -\\frac{9}{2}x - 8$. To find where it intersects the $y$-axis, we set the $x$-coordinate equal to 0 and solve for $y$:\n$y = -\\frac{9}{2}(0) - 8$\n$y = -8$\nTherefore, the $y$-coordinate of the point where this line intersects the $y$-axis is \\boxed{-8}.",

In this case, the points are $(-5, 8)$ and $(-3, -1)$, so the rise is $8-(-1)=9$ and the run is $-5-(-3)=-2$.  Therefore, the $y$-coordinate of the point where the line intersects the $x$-axis is the average of the $x$-coordinates plus the rise: $-5-(-2)+9=\\boxed{6}$.",
