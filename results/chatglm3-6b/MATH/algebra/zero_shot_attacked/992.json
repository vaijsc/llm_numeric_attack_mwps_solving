        " Ultimately, we want to find the highest possible value of $a$.\nTo find the value of $a$, let\u2019s consider the first equation: $6a + 2b = 0$.\nDividing this equation by $2$, we have $3a + b = 0$.\nFrom this equation, we can isolate $b$ by subtracting $3a$ from both sides: $b - 3a = 0$.\nWe can rearrange this equation as follows: $b = 3a$.\nNow, let\u2019s substitute this expression for $b$ into the second equation: $ab = -10$.\nPlugging in $b = 3a$, we have $a \\cdot 3a = -10$.\nSimplifying, we find $3a^2 = -10$.\nDividing both sides by $3$, we get $a^2 = -\\frac{10}{3}$.\nSince the square of a real number cannot be negative, there are no real solutions for $a^2 = -\\frac{10}{3}$. Therefore, there is no real value for $a$ that satisfies both equations.",
        "\nSubstitute $y = 2b$ into the first equation. $6a + 2b = 0$ becomes $6a + 2(y-a) = 0$. Simplifying gives $8a = 2y - 2a$, or $10a = 2y$. We can rewrite this as $5a = y$. Now replace $y$ with $-5a$ to get $5a = -5a$. Clearly, there is no solution to this equation.\nWe can substitute $x = -b$ into the second equation. $ab = -10$ becomes $a(-b) = -10$. Expanding gives $-ab = -10$, so $b = \\frac{10}{a}$. We can substitute $b = \\frac{10}{a}$ into the first equation to eliminate $b$: $6a + 2\\left(\\frac{10}{a}\\right) = 0$. Multiplying through by $a$ (since $a > 0$) gives $6a^2 + 20 = 0$, or $3a^2 + 10 = 0$. However, multiplying both sides by $3$ gives $9a^2 + 30 = 0$, which has no real solutions, so there are no solutions for this system.",
        "\nLet's start by finding the value of b from the equation $ab = -10$. Since we are looking for the greatest possible value of a, we want to find a value of b that will make a smaller value for a. The factors of $-10$ are $\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 5,$ and $\\pm 10$.\nFrom the equation $ab = -10,$ we can see that $a$ and $b$ must have opposite signs. This is because when the factors are multiplied together, they will cancel out to give a negative value. \nThe possible pairs of factors that multiply to $-10$ are:\n$(1, -10), (-1, 10), (2, -5), (-2, 5), (5, -2), (-5, 2), (10, -1), (-10, 1)$.\nFrom the first equation, $6a + 2b = 0$, we can see that the only pair that makes a smaller value for $a$ is $(-1, 10)$. The equation becomes $a = -5$. \nTherefore, the greatest possible value of $a$ is $\\boxed{-5}$.\nThe answer is: -5",
        " We can start by eliminating variables. \nFrom the second equation, we can solve for $b$ in terms of $a$ by dividing through by $a$: \\[b = \\frac{-10}{a}.\\]\nSubstituting this expression for $b$ into the first equation, we can simplify and solve for $a$: \\[6a + 2(\\frac{-10}{a}) = 0.\\]\nMultiplying both sides by $a$, we get \\[6a^2 - 20 = 0.\\]\nDividing both sides by 6, we obtain \\[a^2 - \\frac{10}{3} = 0.\\]\nFactoring, we find \\[(a - \\frac{\\sqrt{10}}{\\sqrt{3}})(a + \\frac{\\sqrt{10}}{\\sqrt{3}}) = 0.\\]\nSo, $a = \\frac{\\sqrt{10}}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{10} \\cdot \\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3} \\cdot \\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{30}}{3}.$\nThe greatest possible value of $a$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{30}}{3}}.$",
        " From the first equation, we can isolate $b$ to get $2b = -6a$. Dividing both sides by 2 gives $b = -3a$. Substituting this value into the second equation gives $(-3a)(-10) = -30a$. Dividing both sides by $-30$ gives $a = \\frac{-10}{3}$. Ultimately, the greatest value of $a$ is $a=\\boxed{\\frac{-10}{3}}$.",
        " Substitute $b = -5$ into the first equation. We get $6a + 2(-5) = 0$, so $6a - 10 = 0$. Solving for $a$, we find $a = \\frac{10}{6} = \\frac{5}{3}$. Substituting $a = \\frac{5}{3}$ into the second equation, we get $\\left(\\frac{5}{3}\\right)\\left(-5\\right) = -10$. Since this equation is true, $\\frac{5}{3}$ is indeed the value that satisfies both equations. Therefore, the greatest possible value of $a$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{3}}$.",

        " To find the greatest possible value of $a$, we need to consider all the constraints given in the problem.\nFirst, let's solve the second equation for $b$ to get $b = \\frac{-10}{a}$.\nNow, let's substitute this expression for $b$ into the first equation. This will give us $\\frac{-10}{a} \\cdot a = 0$.\nSince any non-zero number multiplied by zero is zero, we have $\\frac{-10}{a} = 0$.\nThis implies that $a$ must be a non-zero number. Therefore, we can divide both sides of the equation by $-10$ to get $a = \\frac{-10}{-10}$, which is equal to $a = 1$.\nSo, the greatest possible value of $a$ is $\\boxed{1}$.",
        " First, let's solve the second equation for $b$ in terms of $a$:\n$$ab = -10$$\n$$b = \\frac{-10}{a}$$\nNow let's substitute this value of $b$ into the first equation:\n$$6a + 2\\left(\\frac{-10}{a}\\right) = 0$$\n$$6a - \\frac{20}{a} = 0$$\n$$6a^2 - 20 = 0$$\n$$6a^2 = 20$$\n$$a^2 = \\frac{20}{6}$$\n$$a^2 = \\frac{10}{3}$$\nFinally, let's solve for $a$:\n$$a = \\sqrt{\\frac{10}{3}}$$\n$$a = \\frac{\\sqrt{10}}{\\sqrt{3}}$$\nTherefore, the greatest possible value of $a$ in this system of equations is $\\frac{\\sqrt{10}}{\\sqrt{3}}$.",
        " \nLet's first solve the equation $6a + 2b = 0$ for $b$ in terms of $a$.\n adding $-2b$ to both sides of the equation, we get $6a = -2b$.\n dividing by $-2$, we get $b = -\\frac{6}{2}a = -3a$.\nSo we know that $b = -3a$.\nNext, let's substitute $b = -3a$ into the equation $ab = -10$.\n this gives us $a(-3a) = -10$.\nExpanding and simplifying, we get $-3a^2 = -10$.\nDividing by $-3$, we get $a^2 = \\frac{10}{3}$.\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get $a = \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{10}}{3}$.\nFinally, we need to find the greatest possible value of $a$.\nOut of the two possible values, $\\frac{\\sqrt{10}}{3}$, we take the positive value since we are looking for the greatest possible value.\nTherefore, the greatest possible value of $a$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{10}}{3}}$.",
        " To find the greatest possible value of $a$, we first need to solve the system of equations.\nFirst equation: $6a + 2b = 0$\nWe can solve this equation by dividing both sides by 2 to get $3a + b = 0$.\nSecond equation: $ab = -10$\nSince we don't know yet the value of $b$ from the first equation, we cannot determine the exact value of $ab$.\nTo get more information, we can substitute the value of $b$ from the first equation into the second equation:\n$(6a + b)(-a) = -10$\n$6a^2 - a = -10$\n$6a^2 - a + 10 = 0$\nWe can factor this quadratic equation:\n$(2a - 5)(3a - 2) = 0$\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives us the following values for $a$:\n$2a - 5 = 0$\n$3a - 2 = 0$\nSolving these equations gives us the values for $a$:\n$a = \\frac{5}{2}$\n$a = \\frac{2}{3}$\nSince we are looking for the greatest possible value of $a$, the answer is $\\boxed{2/3}$.",
        " In order to find the greatest possible value of $a$, we'll need to isolate $a$ in one of the equations.\nWe start with the first equation $6a + 2b = 0$.
