Subtract the x-coordinate of Barbara's actual location from the x-coordinate of Annie's location: (-10) - (4) = -14\nSince we want the positive difference, we'll take the absolute value: |-14| = 14.\nTherefore, the positive difference in the x-coordinates of where Annie and Barbara agreed to meet and where they should actually meet is 14.",
