        " We can use the formula distance = speed \u00d7 time.\n#### 1. Calculate distance:\nDistance = speed \u00d7 time\nDistance = $9\\ \\text{m/s}$ \u00d7 $82\\ \\text{s}$\nDistance = $748\\ \\text{m}$\n#### 2. Answer:\nAlice ran $748$ meters.\nThe answer is: 748",
        " To find out how many meters Alice ran, you can simply multiply her speed by the time it took her to run. In this case, her speed is $9\\ \\text{m/s}$ and she ran for $82$ seconds. To get the total distance, you would multiply her speed and the time it took her to run: $9\\ \\text{m/s} \\cdot 82\\ \\text{s}$. This will give you the distance in meters. \nSo the answer is: 748",

        " Since speed = distance/time and distance = speed \u00d7 time, then distance = speed \u00d7 time = $9\\ \\text{m/s} \\times 82\\ \\text{seconds}$.\n### Explanation: The answer is: 748",
        " Step 1: Calculate Alice's total distance.\nWe can calculate Alice's total distance by multiplying her speed by the time she ran.\n Her speed is $9\\ \\text{m/s}$ and she ran for $82$ seconds.\nSo her total distance is $9\\ \\text{m/s} \\times 82\\ \\text{s} = 748\\ \\text{m}$.\nTherefore, Alice ran $\\boxed{748}$ meters.",
        "\nFirst, we need to convert the time from seconds to minutes. Since there are $60$ seconds in a minute, $82$ seconds is $\\frac{82}{60}=\\frac{41}{30}$ minutes.\nNext, we can calculate the distance by multiplying the speed and time. Since Alice ran at a speed of $9\\ \\text{m/s}$, and she ran for $\\frac{41}{30}$ minutes, we get \\[9\\ \\text{m/s} \\times \\frac{41}{30}\\ \\text{minutes} = \\frac{363}{30}\\ \\text{m}.\\] \nFinally, we simplify the fraction to get \\[\\frac{363}{30}\\ \\text{m} = \\frac{363\\div30}{30\\div30}\\ \\text{m} = \\frac{12}{1}\\ \\text{m} = \\boxed{12}\\ \\text{m}.\\]\nThe answer is: 12",
