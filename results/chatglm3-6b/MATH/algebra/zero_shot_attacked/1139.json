        " \nTo solve the equation $9^{\\log_x 49} = 49$, we can use logarithms and properties of exponents.\nFirst, we can rewrite $9$ as $3^2$, so the equation becomes $(3^2)^{\\log_x 49} = 3^{2\\log_x 49}$.\nUsing the property $(a^b)^c = a^{bc}$, we can simplify the equation to $3^{2\\log_x 49} = 3^{2(\\log_x 49)}$.\nSince the bases are the same, we can equate the exponents:\n$2\\log_x 49 = 2(\\log_x 49)$\nNow we can solve for $x$ by dividing both sides of the equation by $2$:\n$\\log_x 49 = \\log_x 49$\nThis equation is true for all values of $x$, so any real number can satisfy the equation. Therefore, there is no unique solution for $x$.",

Since \\(49 = 7^2\\), we can rewrite the equation as \\(x^\\log_x 7^2 = 7^2\\).\nThen, we can use the property \\(\\log_a b^c = c \\log_a b\\), so we can further simplify the equation to \\(x^\\log_x 7 = 7\\).\nTo solve for x, we can take the logarithm of both sides of the equation. Using the property \\(\\log_a b = c \\Rightarrow a^c = b\\), we have \\(\\log_x 7 = \\log_x 7^x\\), which implies \\(x = 1\\).\nTherefore, the solution to the equation \\(9^{\\log_x 49} = 49\\) is \\(\\boxed{x = 1}\\).",
