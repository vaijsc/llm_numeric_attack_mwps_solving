        " The revenue is calculated by multiplying the number of books sold by the price per book.\nSo, revenue = (number of books sold per month) * (price per book) = (120-2p) * p = 120p - 2p^2.\nTo maximize revenue, we need to find the maximum value of this quadratic function.\nThe first step is to find the vertex of the parabola.\nThe x-coordinate of the vertex can be found using the formula x = -b/2a.\nIn this case, a = -2 and b = 120, so x = -120/(2*(-2)) = 60.\nTo check if this is the maximum value, we need to check the value of the quadratic function at x = 60.\nRevenue at x = 60 = 120 * 60 - 2 * 60^2 = 7200 - 720 = 6480.\nSo, the store should charge 6480 to maximize its revenue.\nThe answer is: 6480",
        " The store's revenue will be a function of the number of books sold and the price per book. We can use the formula for the volume of a demand curve to represent the relationship between the number of books sold and the price.\nThe volume of a demand curve is given by Q = 120 - 2p. This means that as the price goes up, the number of books sold decreases. However, the total revenue is given by the product of the number of books sold and the price per book. Therefore, R = p(120 - 2p) = 120p - 2p^2.\nTo maximize the revenue, we need to find the vertex of the parabola represented by the revenue function R = -2p^2 + 120p.\nThe x-coordinate of the vertex can be found using the formula x = -b/2a. In this case, a = -2 and b = 120. Plugging these values into the formula gives us p = -(-2)/(2)(120) = 1/3.\nTherefore, the store should charge p = 1/3 dollars for the book to",
        " To maximize its revenue, the store should charge the price that allows it to sell all the books within the given range.\nThe number of books sold per month is given as 120-2p. It means that for every 1 additional dollar increase in the price, the store will sell 2 fewer books.\nTherefore, we need to find the price that will allow the store to sell 120 books.\nWe can set up the following equation:\n120-2p = 120\nNow, let's solve for p.\nSubtracting 120 from both sides:\n-2p = 0\nDividing both sides by -2:\np = 0\nThe store should charge a price of 0 dollars to maximize its revenue.",

Thus, the revenue function can be expressed as:\nRevenue = (120 - 2p) \\* p = 120p - 2p^2\nIn this function, p is the price per book, and (120 - 2p) represents the number of books sold per month.",
