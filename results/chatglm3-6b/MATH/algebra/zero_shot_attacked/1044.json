        "\nTo find the sum of the first seven positive odd integers, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, which is:\nSum = (n \\* (a1 + an)) / 2\nwhere:\n* n is the number of terms in the sequence (in this case, n = 7)\n* a1 is the first term in the sequence (in this case, a1 = 1)\n* an is the last term in the sequence (in this case, an = 15)\nUsing this formula, we can calculate the sum as follows:\nSum = (7 \\* (1 + 15)) / 2\n     = (7 \\* 16) / 2\n     = 112 / 2\n     = 56\nTherefore, the sum of the first seven positive odd integers is 56.",
        " We can find the sum of the first 7 positive odd integers by using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. The formula states that the sum of the first $n$ terms of an arithmetic series with a common difference $d$ is given by $S = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$, where $S$ is the sum, $n$ is the number of terms, $a_1$ is the first term, and $a_n$ is the last term.\nIn this case, the first term is 1, the last term is the 7th odd integer, which can be found by multiplying 7 by 2 and adding 1, making it $(7)(2)+1=15$, and the common difference is 2, since we are looking for the sum of odd integers.\nPlugging in the values into the formula, we get $S = \\frac{7}{2}(1+15)$.\nSimplifying the expression, we have $S = \\frac{7}{2}(16) = \\boxed{49}$.\nTherefore, the sum of the first seven positive odd integers is 49.",

        "\nTo find the sum of the first seven positive odd integers, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.\nThe first term is 1 and the common difference is 2, since we are adding odd numbers starting from 1.\nThe nth term of the arithmetic series can be found using the formula: an = a1 + (n - 1)d, where an is the nth term, a1 is the first term, and d is the common difference.\nSo, the 7th term is a7 = 1 + (7 - 1)2 = 1 + 12 = 13.\nTo find the sum of the first seven odd integers, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: Sn = (n/2)(a1 + an), where Sn is the sum, n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the nth term.\nIn this case, n = 7, a1 = 1, and an = 13.\nSo, the sum of the first seven positive odd integers is Sn = (7/2)(1 + 13) = 7/2 * 14 = 49/2 = 24.5.\n#### 24.5\nThe answer is: 24.5",

The first term is 1 and the last term can be found by adding the common difference (2) to the first term. \nSo, l = 1 + (2 * 6) = 1 + 12 = 13.\nWe can now substitute these values into the formula:\nS = (7/2)(1 + 13)\nS = (7/2)(14)\nS = (7/2)(7/2)(2)\nS = 7(7)(2)\nS = 98\nTherefore, the sum of the first seven positive odd integers is 98.",
