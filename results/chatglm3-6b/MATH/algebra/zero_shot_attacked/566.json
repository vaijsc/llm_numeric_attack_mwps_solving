        "\nTo find all solutions to the equation x(x+15) = 15(-15-x), we can start by simplifying the equation.\nFirst, distribute on both sides of the equation:\nx^2 + 15x = -225 - 15x\nNext, combine like terms on the left side:\nx^2 + 30x + 225 = 0\nNow, we can use factoring to solve for x. However, the quadratic equation is not easily factored. Therefore, we can use the quadratic formula to find the solutions:\nx = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 30, and c = 225. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\nx = (-30 \u00b1 \u221a(30^2 - 4(1)(225))) / (2(1))\nSimplifying under the square root:\nx = (-30 \u00b1 \u221a(900 - 900)) / 2\nSince the square root of 0 is 0, the equation simplifies further:\nx = (-30 \u00b1 0) / 2\nNow we have two cases to consider:\n1. When the sign of the solution is positive:\nx = -30 / 2 = -15\n2. When the sign of the solution is negative:\nx = -30 / 2 = -15\nSince these are the only two solutions, we can conclude that the solutions to the equation x(x+15) = 15(-15-x) are x = -15.",
