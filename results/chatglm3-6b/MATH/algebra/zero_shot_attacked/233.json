        "\nWe can tell that this quadratic can be written in the form $(x+b)^2+c$ because the completed square trinomial $(x+b)^2+c$ has the same coefficient of $x^2$ as the original quadratic, $x^2$. \nTo complete the square, we need to add and subtract the square of half the coefficient of $x$, which is $(6/2)^2=9$. Therefore,\n$(x+b)^2+c=(x+b)^2+9-9+c=x^2-6x+66=(x-3)^2-3+66=x^2-6x+69$. \nSo, $b=-3$ and $c=69$, and $b+c= -3 + 69 = \\boxed{66}$.",
        "\nTo write $x^2 - 6x + 66$ in the form $(x + b)^2 + c$, we want to balance the unsure parts of $x^2 - 6x$ by adding and subtracting a constant that makes the expression cubic. \nWhen we fix the coefficient of $x^2$ by evaluating it to 1, we can make the $-6x$ term balance by adding and subtracting the same constant entity to the expression, namely $(-6/2)^2 = 9$. Applying this change, we obtain:  $1^2 - 6(1) + 9 = x^2 - 6x + 18$.\nSo, we can rewrite $x^2 - 6x + 66$ as $(x^2 - 6x + 18) + 48 = (x - 3)^2 + 48$.
