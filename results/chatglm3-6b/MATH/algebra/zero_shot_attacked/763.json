        " \nTo start, we should find a common denominator for the fractions. Notice that both fractions have a denominator of $x-1$. We can multiply the first fraction by $\\frac{1}{1}$ and the second fraction by $\\frac{1}{2}$, which doesn't change the value of the equation (remember, $\\frac{A}{C-B} + \\frac{D}{C-B} = \\frac{A+D}{C-B}$). This gives us the following:\n$\\frac{1}{x-1} + \\frac{2x}{x - 1} = \\frac{1+ 2x}{x - 1} = 6$\nNext, we can simplify the denominator by factoring out $x-1$:\n$\\frac{(1+ 2x)}{x - 1} = 6$\nNow, we can cross multiply and simplify:\n$(1+ 2x) = 6(x - 1)$\n$1 + 2x = 6x - 6$\n$1 - 6x = -2x$\n$1 = 4x$\nNow we solve for $x$ by dividing both sides of the equation by $4$:\n$x = \\frac{1}{4}$\nSo, the solution is $x = \\frac{1}{4}$.",
