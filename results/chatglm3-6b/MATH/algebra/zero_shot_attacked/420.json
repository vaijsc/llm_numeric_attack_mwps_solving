        " In order to find the y-intercept of $Q(x)$, we need to determine the value of $x$ when $Q(x)$ is equal to $0$. \n### Solution: To find the y-intercept of $Q(x)$, we set $Q(x)$ equal to zero and solve for $x$:\n$Q(x) = P(x)^2$\n$0 = 4x^3 - 2x^2 + 7x - 2$\nSince we don't have enough information to determine the exact value of $x$, we can conclude that the y-intercept is any point on the graph of $Q(x)$ where $Q(x)$ intersects the y-axis, which represents the x-coordinate being zero.\nThe graph of a function $Q(x)$ can be found by squaring the graph of $P(x)$. Since $P(x)$ is not a perfect cube, $P(x)^2$ will not be a straight line, but will instead form a downward-opening parabola. We can't determine the exact shape of the parabola just from looking at the expression $Q(x)$, so we cannot represent it with a\u5177\u4f53\u7684 equation in the form $y = ax^2 + bx + c$.\nTherefore, we cannot determine the specific y-intercept of $Q(x)$ with the given information.",
        " To find the $y$-intercept of $Q(x)$, we need to find the value of $x$ when $Q(x) = 0$. In other words, we need to solve the equation: $$P(x)^2 = 0.$$Since $P(x) = 4x^3 - 2x^2 + 7x - 2$, we have to solve: $$(4x^3 - 2x^2 + 7x - 2)^2 = 0.$$Let's start by expanding the left side of the equation: $$(4x^3 - 2x^2 + 7x - 2)(4x^3 - 2x^2 + 7x - 2).$$Expanding this expression for all possible combinations of factors will lead us to a complexity difficult to manage, so we'll look for a pattern or shortcut. Notice that taking the derivative of $P(x)$ gives us $12x^2 - 4x + 7$, so we can write: \\begin{align*}\nQ(x) &= (4x^3 - 2x^2 + 7x - 2)(4x^3 - 2x^2 + 7x - 2) \\\\\n&= (4x^3 - 2x^2 + 7x - 2)(4x^3 - 2x^2 + 7x - 2) \\\\\n&= (4x^3 - 2x^2 + 7x - 2)(4x^3 - 2x^2 + 7x - 2)\\\\\n&=(4x^3 + 2x^2 - 7x + 2)(4x^3 - 2x^2 + 7x - 2)\\\\\n&=(4 + \\frac{2}{x})(8x^2-\\frac{2}{x}+7x-2)\\\\\n&=\\left(4+\\frac{2}{x}\\right)\\left(8x^2-1+7\\frac{2}{x}\\right).\n\\end{align*}Notice that the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of $Q(x)$ is given by $\\frac{1}{8}$, so we know we already have a critical point of the form $$(4+\\frac",
