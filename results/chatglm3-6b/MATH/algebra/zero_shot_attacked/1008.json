        "\nFirst, let's solve the equation $|7x-2|=x+4$ one value at a time. Since the absolute value can only equal one of two things, we'll solve for both cases. Starting with the first case, when $|7x-2|=7x-2$, our equation becomes $7x-2=x+4$. Rearranging, we get $6x=6$ and solving for $x$ gives $x=1$. Now, we can look at the second case, when $|7x-2|=-(7x-2)$. This gives us $7x-2=-x-4$ which simplifies to $8x=-6$. Solving for $x$, we get $x=-\\frac{3}{4}$. However, we were asked to find the largest value of $x$ that satisfies the equation, so we need to choose the greater one of the two values. In this case, $x=\\frac{4}{8}=\\frac{1}{2}$ is greater than $x=-\\frac{3}{4}$. Therefore, the largest value of $x$ that satisfies the equation is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.",
