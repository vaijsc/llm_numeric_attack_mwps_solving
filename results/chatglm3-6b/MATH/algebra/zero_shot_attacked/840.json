        " To solve this problem, we need to find the cost of one pencil and multiply it by three to find the cost of three pencils.\nLet's call the cost of a pencil $x$.\nFrom the given information, we can set up the following equation:\n3x + 200 = 128\nTo isolate x, we subtract 200 from both sides of the equation:\n3x + 200 - 200 = 128 - 200\n3x = -72\nFinally, we divide both sides of the equation by 3 to solve for x:\nx = -72 / 3\nx = -24\nThe cost of a pencil is -24 cents. However, this makes no sense in this context since we can't have a negative cost for a pencil.\nTherefore, there is no valid answer to this question.",
        " To find the cost of a pencil, we need to find the cost of a single pencil first. We can do this by using a system of equations.\nLet x be the cost of a pencil in cents.\nFrom the first statement, we can write the following equation: 3*x + 400 = 128.\nThis equation represents that the cost of 3 pencils is 128 cents and the cost of the eraser is 400 cents.\nFrom the second statement, we can also write the following equation: 5*x + 600 = 282.0.\nThis equation represents that the cost of 5 pencils is 282 cents and the cost of the eraser is 600 cents.\nNow we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve this system by substitution, elimination or any other method that you prefer. The answer is: 7",
        " To find the cost of a pencil, we can set up a system of equations based on the given information. \nLet's call the cost of one pencil p and the cost of the jumbo eraser er.\nFrom the given information, we can set up the following equations:\n1. 3p + er = 128\n2. 5p + er = 282\nTo eliminate the er variable, we can multiply the first equation by 5 and the second equation by 3, and then subtract the equations:\n5p + 5er - (3p + er) = 282 - 128\n2p + 4er = 154\nNow we have a system of two equations with two variables, p and er. We need to find the cost of a pencil. \nWe can solve this system of equations by\u9694\u79bb relying on the eliminate method.\nStep 1: Subject er to p\n5p + 4er = 154\nDivide by 5\np + 0.8er = 30.8\nStep 2: Subject er to these coefficients \ner = (30.8 - 3p) / 0.8\nSubstitute er's value back into the first equation\n3p + (30.8 - 3p) / 0.8 = 128\nMultiply both sides by 0.8\n2.4p + 30.8 - 3p = 104\n1.4p = 74\nDivide both sides by 1.4\np = 53\nNow we know the cost of one pencil is 53 cents.\nSo, the cost of a pencil is $\\boxed{53}$ cents.",
        " To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations. Let's assume the cost of one pencil is x cents. \nAccording to the instructions given, the cost of three pencils and a jumbo eraser is $1.28. So the equations will be:\n3x + (2 * x) + 2j = 128\nWe also know that the cost of five pencils and a jumbo eraser is $2.82. Therefore the second equation will be:\n5x + (2 * x) + 2j = 282\nNow, we can solve both equations simultaneously to find the values of x, which represents the cost of one pencil in cents. \nLet's solve the system of equations by substitution. \nFirst, we can simplify the equations:\n3x + 6x + 2j = 128\n9x + 2j = 128\n9x = 128 - 2j\nx = (128 - 2j) / 9\nNow, substitute this value of x into the second equation to solve for j:\n5( (128 - 2j) / 9) + (2 * (128 - 2j) / 9) + 2j = 282\nMultiply both sides of the equation by 9 to eliminate the fraction:\n5(128 - 2j) + 2(128 - 2j) + 18j = 2528\n640 - 10j + 256 - 4j + 18j = 2528\n640 - j + 256 = 2528\nSubtract 640 and 256 from both sides of the equation:\nj = 2528 - 640 - 256\nj = 1632\nNow that we have the value of j, we can go back to solve for x:\n9x = 128 - 2j\nx = (128 - 2j) / 9\nSubstitute j = 163",

We will start by isolating the variable p.\n```lua\n5p - 3p = 128 -282  --(2)\n```\nSubtracting 128 from both sides of equation (1) gives us:\n```lua\n4p = 154  --(3)\n```\nThe cost of one pencil is the cost of three pencils and a jumbo eraser divided by 4, not including the cost of the jumbo eraser. To get the value in the question that costs $1.28, we multiply the cost of one pencil by 10:\n```lua\n10* 4p = 154* 10  --(4)\n```\nWe will now find the value of p by dividing the value on the right side of (4) by the value on the left side:\n```lua\n5p = 1540\n```\nFinally, we can find p by dividing both sides of the equation by 5, which gives us the price of one pencil:\n```lua\np = 1540 / 5\np = 308\n```\nThe cost of one pencil is $\\boxed{308}$ cents.",

The system will look something like this:\npencil1 + eraser1 = cost1\n5 + eraser1 = cost2\nWe can solve this system by substitution by solving the second equation for eraser1 and then substituting the result into the first equation. This would give us:\npencil1 + (13 - 5) = 128\nSimplifying, we get:\npencil1 + 8 = 128\nSubtracting 8 from both sides, we get:\npencil1 = 120\nTherefore, the cost of a pencil is 120 cents.",
