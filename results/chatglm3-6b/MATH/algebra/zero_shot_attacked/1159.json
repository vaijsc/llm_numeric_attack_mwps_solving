        "\nStep 1: Complete the square for the equation\nTo complete the square for the equation x^2 + 7x + y^2 + 8y = 0, we need to add and subtract the square of half of the coefficient of x. So, adding and subtracting (7/2)^2 = 49/4. We get:\nx^2 + 7x + 49/4 - 49/4 + y^2 + 8y = 0\nNow, the equation becomes:\n(x^2 + 7x) + 49/4 + y^2 + 8y = 49/4\nThis can be written as:\n(x + 7/2)^2 - 49/4 + y^2 + 8y = 49/4\nStep 2: Complete the square for y^2 + 8y\nTo complete the square for y^2 + 8y, we need to add and subtract the square of half of the coefficient of y, which is (8/2)^2 = 16. So, we get:\ny^2 + 8y + 16 - 16 = 49/4\nStep 3: Rewrite the equation in standard form\nThe equation becomes:\n(x + 7/2)^2 + y^2 + 8y + 49/4 - 49/4 = 16\nNow, the equation in standard form is:\n(x + 7/2)^2 + (y + 4/2)^2 = 4\nStep 4: Identify the center of the circle\nThe equation in standard form of a circle is:\n(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\nwhere (h, k) is the center of the circle and r is the radius. In this case, h = (-7/2), k = (-4/2), and r^2 = 4. Since r^2 is positive, this means the equation represents a circle with center (-7/2, -4/2) and radius 2.\nStep 5: Calculate the sum of the coordinates of the center\nThe sum of the coordinates of the center is (-7/2) + (-4/2) =",
