        " We can rewrite the equation as $(a^b)(a) + (b^a) = a b$.\nIn this case, $a = 6$ and $b = 6$.\nSo, $6 * 6 = (6^6) + (6^6) = 2(6^6) = 2 \\cdot 6^6$.\n### Solution: We can simplify the expression $2 \\cdot 6^6$ by multiplying $6$ by itself $6$ times.\nTherefore, $2 \\cdot 6^6 = 6 \\cdot 6^6 = 6 \\cdot 6^2 \\cdot 2^2 = 6 \\cdot 6^2 \\cdot (2^2)$.\nNow, we can multiply $6^2 = 6 \\cdot 6 = 36$ by $2^2 = 4$, which is the Two-Square Root rule.\nTherefore, $6 \\cdot 6^2 \\cdot (2^2) = 6 \\cdot 36 \\cdot 4 = \\boxed{864}$.",
        " We begin by substituting $a = 6$ and $b = 6$ into the given equation: \\begin{align*}\n6 \\cdot 6 &= 6^6 + 6^6 \\\\\n&= 6 + 6\n\\end{align*} After simplifying the expression, we find that $6 \\cdot 6 = 12$.\nHence, $6 * 6 = \\boxed{12}$.",
        "\nFirst, we know that $6 * 6 = a * a$. Now, we need to find the values of $a$ and $b$. Since $a$ and $b$ are positive integers, the only possible value for $a$ is 2, so we can write $6 * 6 = 2^2 + 2^2 = 4 + 4$. This means that $a = b = 2$. Therefore, the value of $6 * 6$ is $4 + 4 = \\boxed{8}$.",
        " We can substitute $a = 2$ and $b = 2$ into the given equation:\n$$2 \\cdot 2 = 2^2 + 2^2$$\n$$4 = 4 + 4$$\nThis holds true.\nNow, let\u2019s substitute $a = 3$ and $b = 2$ into the given equation:\n$$3 \\cdot 2 = 3^2 + 2^3$$\n$$6 = 9 + 8$$\nThis also holds true.\nTherefore, we can conclude that the equation $a * b = a^b + b^a$ is true for all positive integer values of $a$ and $b$.",

        " Since $6 * 6 = 36$, we want to find $a * 6$ such that $a^6 + 6^a = 36$.\nWe can try different values of a and calculate the left-hand side of the equation.\nIf $a=1$, then $1^6 + 6^1 = 1 + 6 = 7$, which is not equal to 36.\nIf $a=2$, then $2^6 + 6^2 = 64 + 36 = 100$, which is not equal to 36.\nIf $a=3$, then $3^6 + 6^3 = 729 + 216 = 945$, which is not equal to 36.\nIf $a=4$, then $4^6 + 6^4 = 4096 + 1296 = 5392$, which is not equal to 36.\nIf $a=5$, then $5^6 + 6^5 = 9536 + 7776 = 17312$, which is not equal to 36.\nIf $a=6$, then $6^6 + 6^6 = 46656 + 46656 = 93312$, which is not equal to 36.\nIf none of the values satisfy the equation, then the question does not have any solution.\n### Answer: The question does not have any solution.",
        " To find the value of $6 * 6$, we can substitute $a = 6$ and $b = 6$ into the expression $a * b = a^b + b^a$.\nSo, $6 * 6 = 6^6 + 6^6 = 2(6^6)$.\n### Answer: The value of $6 * 6$ is $2(6^6)$.",
        " We start by plugging in the values for $a$ and $b$ to see if we can find a pattern.\nFor $a = 2$ and $b = 2$, we have $2 * 2 = 2^2 + 2^2 = 4 + 4 = 8$.\nFor $a = 2$ and $b = 3$, we have $2 * 3 = 2^3 + 3^2 = 8 + 9 = 17$.\nFor $a = 3$ and $b = 2$, we have $3 * 2 = 3^2 + 2^3 = 9 + 8 = 17$.\nFor $a = 3$ and $b = 3$, we have $3 * 3 = 3^3 + 3^3 = 27 + 27 = 54$.\nFrom these calculations, we can see that when $a$ is the same as $b$, the value is always $a^b + b^a$.\nFor $a = 6$ and $b = 6$, we have $6 * 6 = 6^6 + 6^6 = 46656 + 46656 = \\boxed{93312}$.\nThe answer is: 93312",

        "\nWe know from the given instruction that: In this case, $a = 6$ and $b = 6$.\nTherefore, $6 * 6 = 6^6 + 6^6$.\nIf we simplify this expression, we get $6^{6+6}$.\nBy using the principle of exponentiation, we can simplify further as: $6^{12}$.\nThe value of $6 * 6$ is $6^{12}$.\nTo solve this problem, we can use the\u4e24\u4e2a\u4eba(){}Identity: a^a - a^0 = a(a-1).

        "\nThe first step is to make sure that $a$ and $b$ are positive integers. In this case, we already know that $a = 6$ and $b = 6$, so they are both positive integers.\nNext, we can use the given equation $a \\cdot b = a^b + b^a$ to substitute the values of $a$ and $b$ into the equation and solve for the value of $6 \\cdot 6$.\nSubstituting $a = 6$ and $b = 6$ into the equation, we get $6 \\cdot 6 = 6^6 + 6^6$.\nCombining like terms on the right side of the equation, we have $6 \\cdot 6 = 2(6^6)$.\nDividing both sides of the equation by 2, we find that $3 \\cdot 6 = 6^6$.\nSimplifying, we have $18 = 6^6$.\nTo find the value of $6 \\cdot 6$, we need to find the exponential value of 18 to the power of 6.\nTherefore, the value of $6 \\cdot 6$ is $18$.",
        " We have $6 * 6 = a * b = a^b + b^a$.\nWe can start by calculating the value of $a^b + b^a$ for $a = 6$ and $b = 6$.\nSo, $a^b + b^a = 6^6 + 6^6 = 2(6^6) = 2(216) = \\boxed{432}$.\nThe answer is: 432",
