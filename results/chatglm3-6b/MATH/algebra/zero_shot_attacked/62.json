        "\nTo solve this problem, we need to first find the roots of the equation $x(x-3)=2$.\nThe equation can be simplified by distribute on the left side by $x$:\n$(x^2 - 3x) = 2$\nWe rewrite the equation in a quadratic form by moving the $2$ on the right side:\n$x^2 - 3x - 2 = 0$\nNow we want to find the roots of this quadratic equation. We can either factor or use the quadratic formula. Here, factoring might be easier:\n$(x-5)(x+1) = 0$\nSo the two possible solutions are $x=5$ and $x=-1$.\nNext, we need to express these solutions in the form $\\frac{a+\\sqrt{b}}{c}$ and $\\frac{a-\\sqrt{b}}{c}$.\nFrom $x=5$:\n$5(5-3) = 2$\n$5=2+3\\sqrt{2}$\n$5=20+6\\sqrt{2}+9$\n$5=29+6\\sqrt{2}$\nSo $a=29$, $b=6$, and $c=1$ for this solution.\nFrom $x=-1$:\n$-1(-1-3) = 2$\n$-1=-2+3\\sqrt{2}$\n$-1=-20+6\\sqrt{2}+9$\n$-1=-29+6\\sqrt{2}$\nThis solution does not work since the leading coefficient $-1$ cannot be expressed in the form $a+\\sqrt{b}$ or $a-\\sqrt{b}$.\nTherefore, the only valid solution is $x=5$ with $a=29$, $b=6$, and $c=1$, and the answer is $abc=29\\cdot 6\\cdot 1=\\boxed{174}$.",
        " \nSolution: To find the solutions of $x(x-3)=2$, we can start by multiplying out the left side of the equation:\n$x^2 - 3x = 2$\nNext, we can add $3x$ to both sides of the equation:\n$x^2 = 2 + 3x$\nNow, we need to rearrange the equation in the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are integers and $c \\neq 0$. In this case, we want the coefficient of $x^2$ to be 1, the coefficient of $x$ to be 3, and the constant term to be 2.\nTo achieve this, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:\n$2x^2 - 6x + 4 = 0$\nComparing this with $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, we can see that $a=2$, $b=-6$, and $c=4$.\nTherefore, the solutions to the equation can be expressed in the form $\\frac{2+a}{c}$.\nNow, we need to simplify $a$ and $c$.\nSince $a = 2$ and $c = 4$, we can rewrite the expression as $\\frac{2+2}{4}$.\nSimplifying the numerator gives us $4$ and simplifying the denominator gives us $4$.\nTherefore, the solutions to the equation are $\\frac{a+2}{c} = \\frac{4}{4} = 1$.\nFinally, we can find $abc = 2 \\cdot 4 = \\boxed{8}$.",
