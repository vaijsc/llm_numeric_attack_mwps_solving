        "\nLet's assume that the number of quarters in the second pile is x.\nAccording to the given information, the first pile has 3 fewer than the second pile, so the number of quarters in the first pile is x - 3.\nThe second pile has 2 more than the third pile, so the number of quarters in the third pile is x - 2.\nThe fourth pile has twice as many as the second pile, so the number of quarters in the fourth pile is 2x.\nIn total, there are 30 quarters, so the equation x + (x - 3) + (x - 2) + 2x = 30.\nCombining like terms, we get 4x - 5 = 30.\nAdding 5 to both sides, we get 4x = 35.\nDividing both sides by 4, we get x = 35/4 = 8.25.\nSince we can't have a fraction of a quarter, we round down to the nearest whole number.\nTherefore, the fourth pile has 2 * 8 = 16 quarters.\n#### 16\nThe answer is: 16",
