        " 1. Determine the degree of $g(x)$ individually.  We know that when you replace the variable $g(x)$ with $g(x)$, the degree of the resulting polynomial $f(g(x))$ is multiplied by the degree of $g(x)$. So, $f(g(x))$ will have a degree of $8 \\cdot \\text{degree of } g(x)$. Therefore, if $h(x) = f(g(x)) + g(x)$, then thedegree of $h(x)$ is $8 \\cdot \\text{degree of } g(x) + \\text{degree of } g(x)$.\n### Solution: 1. $h(x) = 8 \\cdot \\text{degree of } g(x) + \\text{degree of } g(x) = \\text{degree of } g(x) + \\text{degree of } g(x)$  or $h(x) = 2 \\cdot \\text{degree of } g(x)$\nSince we know that the degree of $h(x)$ is $12$, then $\\text{degree of } g(x) = \\frac{12}{2} = 6$. Therefore, the degree of $g(x)$ is $\\boxed{6}$.",
        "\nSince the degree of $h(x)$ is $12$ and the degree of $f(x)$ is $8$, we know that the degree of $g(x)$ must be at least $12$, since adding two terms of the same degree will result in a term of degree at most $12$.\nFrom the given expression, we can see that another term that we need to consider is when we plug in $g(x) = g$, so we consider $f(g(x)) + g(g(x))$.\nWhen $g(x) = g$, we have $f(g(g(x)) + g(x))$. Notice that when we substitute $g(g(x))$ into the polynomial, it becomes $f(g(g(x)))$.\nNow, we can compare the degree of $f(g(g(x)))$ with the degree of $h(x)$ to find the degree of $g(x)$. Since the degree of $h(x)$ is $12$, we know that the degree of $f(nst)$ is $8nst$ when $n,s,t \\ge 0$ and $f(nst) = 0$.\nLooking at $f(g(g(x)))$, we see that when $g(g(x))$ is plugged in, the degree of $f$ is still $8$, but the degree of $g(g(x))$ is different.\nSimilarly, when we plug in $g(g(g(x)))$, the degree of $f$ is still $8$, but the degree of $g(g(g(x)))$ is different.\nWhen we plug in $g(g(g(g(x))))$, the degree of $f$ is still $8$, but the degree of $g(g(g(g(x))))$ is different.\nFrom this pattern, we can conclude that the degree of $g(x)$ is also $8$.\nTherefore, the degree of $g(x)$ is $\\boxed{8}$.The answer is: 8",
        " Let\u2019s take $h(x)$ and simplify:\n$$h(x) = f(g(x)) + g(x)$$\nLet $deg(f(g(x))) = a$ and $deg(g(x)) = b$. Then $h(x)$ can be expressed as:\n$$h(x) = a + bx + c + d$$\nwhere $c$ and $d$ are coefficients ( irrelevant to the degree here). Given that $deg(f(g(x))) = 12$, we can substitute in $a$ in place of $f(g(x))$ to get:\n$$a = g(x) \\cdot g'(x) + c + d$$\nwhere $g'(x)$ is the derivative of $g(x)$.\nSimilarly, given that $deg(g(x)) = 8$, we can substitute in $b$ in place of $g(x)$ to get:\n$$b = g(x) \\cdot g'(x) + c + d$$\nWe know that $h(x)$ is a polynomial, so $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are coefficients. Therefore, we have a system of equations:\n$$\\begin{cases} a = g(x) \\cdot g'(x) + c + d \\\\ b = g(x) \\cdot g'(x) + c + d \\end{cases}$$\nTherefore, the degree of $g(x)$ is $\\boxed{10}$.",

        " \nWe know that the degree of a polynomial is the highest power of $x$ in the polynomial. \nSince $h(x) = f(g(x)) + g(x)$, the degree of the polynomial $h(x)$ is the same as the degree of the polynomial $f(g(x))$ plus the degree of the polynomial $g(x)$. \nThe degree of $f(x)$ is $8$ and the degree of $h(x)$ is $12$.

This can be inconsistent with the given information, so the degree $g(x)$ cannot be a perfect square.\nBut, if $g(x)$ is not a perfect square, then we can assume that the degree of $g(x)$ is $3$, and the average degree of $g(x)$ would be $3$. This is consistent with the given information.\nTherefore, the degree of $g(x)$ that satisfies the given conditions is $\\boxed{3}$.$2$.",
        " \nWe might be able to gather some information from degree and leading coefficient that can\u544a\u8bc9\u6211\u4eec something about the degree of $g(x)$.  \nGiven that the degree of $h(x)$ is $12$ and the degree of $f(x)$ is $8$, we know that $h(x)$ has degree $12$ because that is the highest degree among the three terms.  We also know that the leading coefficient of $h(x)$ is the product of the leading coefficients of the three terms.  While we don\u2019t know the coefficients of $f(g(x))$ or $g(x)$, we know that the leading coefficient of $h(x)$ is $1$.  Therefore, the leading coefficient of $h(x)$ is the product of the leading coefficients of the terms in $f(g(x))$.  $1$ divided by $1 = 1$ so the leading coefficient of $h(x)$ is $1$.\nHowever, $h(x)$ is not limited to one degree term; a leading coefficient of $1$ does not\u7248\u6743-protect the structure of $f(g(x))$.  Therefore, we still need more information to proceed.  Above, we let $n$ represent the degree of $g(x)$. We have $n+1$ terms in $h(x)$, so we need a similar quantity for the degree of $f(g(x))$.  Let $m$ be the degree of $f(g(x))$.  Then it can be reasoned that the degree of $f(g(x))$ is $(n+1)-m$, so the degree of $f(g(x))$ is also ensuring that $h(x)$ has degree $12$. If $m=8$, then the degree of $f(g(x))$ is $12-n$.  To solve for $n$, note that the degree of $f(g(x))$ is $(n+1)-m$, and this degree must also be equal to $(12-n)$. Therefore, $n+1=12-n$.  We then solve this equation, which leads to $2n=11$.  $n=\\frac{11}{2}$, which means that the degree of $g(x)$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{11}{2}",
        " \n#### Example 1:\nLet's start with the first example.\nSuppose $f(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 - x + 5$ and $g(x) = x^2 - 3x + 4$.\nHere, $h(x) = f(g(x)) + g(x) = f(x^2 -3x + 4) + (x^2 - 3x + 4)$\nTo find the degree of $g(x)$, we can look at the leading term of the polynomial $f(g(x))$.\nWe can calculate the value by substituting $g(x)$ into the expression for $f(x)$:\n$f(g(x)) = f(x^2 -3x + 4) = (x^2 - 3x + 4)f(x)$\nNow, we can substitute this result into the expression for $h(x)$:\n$h(x) = (x^2 - 3x + 4)f(x) + (x^2 - 3x + 4)$\nFactoring out the common factor of $(x^2 - 3x + 4)$, we have:\n$h(x) = (x^2 - 3x + 4)(f(x) + 1)$\nFrom this, we can see that the degree of $g(x)$ is $2$, because the highest degree term in the expression $f(g(x))$ is of degree $2$ (the degree of the quadratic term in $g(x)$ multiplied by the degree of $f(x)$).\nLet's verify our answer with the provided test cases.",
        " Since $h(x)$ is defined as $f(g(x)) + g(x)$, the degree of $h(x)$ is the maximum of the degrees of $f(g(x))$ and $g(x)$. Let\u2019s call the degree of $g(x)$ as $d$. \nThe degree of $f(g(x))$ is the degree of $f$ multiplied by the degree of $g(x)$. Therefore, the degree of $f(g(x))$ is $8 \\times d$. \nThus, the degree of $h(x)$ is the maximum of $8 \\times d$ and $d$. \nGiven that the degree of $h(x)$ is $12$, we can set up the inequality $8 \\times d + d \\geq 12$. \nSimplifying the inequality, we have $9d \\geq 12$. \nDividing both sides by $9$, we get $d \\geq \\frac{12}{9}$. \nSimplifying, we find $d \\geq \\frac{4}{3}$. \nTherefore, the degree of $g(x)$ must be $\\frac{4}{3}$ or greater.",

        " Given that the degree of $h(x)$ is $12$ and the degree of $f(x)$ is $8$, we can conclude that both $g(x)$ and $x$ must be factors of $h(x)$. Therefore, the degree of $g(x)$ must be at least $12-8 = 4$.\nMoreover, we can conclude that $g(x)$ is not a constant polynomial since if it were, the degree of $g(x)$ would be $0$, which by definition is not the case. Therefore, $g(x)$ must be a polynomial of degree at least $4$ for the degree of $h(x)$ to be $12$.\nFinally, we know that $h(x) = f(g(x)) + g(x)$.

        " Let's consider the general form of a polynomial function. A polynomial has degree $n$, which means the highest power of $x$ in the polynomial.
