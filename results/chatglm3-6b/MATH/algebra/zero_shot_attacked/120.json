        "\nThe logarithm of a number, denoted $\\log_a(x)$, is the exponent to which the base $a$ must be raised to obtain the number $x$. In other words, $\\log_a(x) = n$ if and only if $a^n = x$.\nTo evaluate $\\log_2 66$, we want to find the exponent $n$ to which 2 must be raised to obtain 66. In other words, we want to find $n$ such that $2^n = 66$.\nWe can start by finding the smallest power of 2 that is greater than 66. Since $2^3 = 8$ and $8 < 66$, we try the next power of 2, which is $2^4 = 16$. Again, $16 < 66$, so we continue to the next power, $2^5 = 32$. $32 < 66$ and $2^6 = 64$, which is still less than 66.\nWe continue this process until we find a power of 2 that is greater than 66. In this case, $2^7 = 128$ is the smallest power of 2 greater than 66. Therefore, $\\log_2 66 = \\boxed{7}$.\nThe answer is: 7",
