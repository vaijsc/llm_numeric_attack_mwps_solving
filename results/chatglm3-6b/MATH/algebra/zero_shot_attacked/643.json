        " \nTo determine the rock-climbing shoe size for Adina, we can use the concept of direct proportionality. Since the ratio of Lynn's normal shoe size to her rock-climbing shoe size is 9:42, we can set up the following proportion:\n9/42 = (\u89c0\u6e2c\u503c - \u6b63\u5e38\u503c) / (\u5ca9\u77f3\u6500\u722c\u978b\u865f - \u6b63\u5e38\u978b\u865f)\nwhere \u89c0\u6e2c\u503c is the rock-climbing shoe size for Adina, and \u6b63\u5e38\u503c is Adina's normal shoe size.\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n\u6b63\u5e38\u503c * 42 = 9 * (\u89c0\u6e2c\u503c - \u6b63\u5e38\u503c)\n\u6b63\u5e38\u503c * 42 = 9 * \u89c0\u6e2c\u503c - \u6b63\u5e38\u503c * 9\n42 * \u6b63\u5e38\u503c = 9 * \u89c0\u6e2c\u503c - 9 * \u6b63\u5e38\u503c\n42 * \u6b63\u5e38\u503c = 9 * \u89c0\u6e2c\u503c - 9 * \u6b63\u5e38\u503c + 9 * \u6b63\u5e38\u503c\n42 * \u6b63\u5e38\u503c = 9 * (\u89c0\u6e2c\u503c + \u6b63\u5e38\u503c)\nDividing both sides by 9, we get:\n\u6b63\u5e38\u503c * 5 = \u89c0\u6e2c\u503c\nNow, we can determine Adina's rock-climbing shoe size by substituting her normal shoe size, 9, into the relationship:\n9 * 5 = \u89c0\u6e2c\u503c\n45 = \u89c0\u6e2c\u503c\nTherefore, Adina should rent rock-climbing shoes in size 45.",
        " \nTo determine the rock-climbing shoe size for Adina, we can multiply her normal shoe size by the ratio ofrock-climbing shoe size to normal shoe size. \nDetermine the ratio of rock-climbing shoe size to normal shoe size. \nSince Lynn's normal shoe size is 9 and her rock-climbing shoe size is 42, the ratio is 42/9 = <<42/9=4.67>>4.67\nMultiply Adina's normal shoe size by the ratio to find her rock-climbing shoe size. \nAdina's normal shoe size is 9, so her rock-climbing shoe size is 9 * 4.67 = <<9*4.67=41.03>>41.03.\nTherefore, Adina should rent rock-climbing shoes that are in the size 41, rounding down to the nearest whole number. Answer: \\boxed{41}.",
        "\nTo determine the size of the rock-climbing shoes that Adina should rent, we can use the concept of direct proportionality. Direct proportionality states that if one variable is increased or decreased by a constant factor, the value of another variable is also increased or decreased by the same factor.\nIn this case, we know that Lynn's normal shoe size is 9 and her rock-climbing shoe size is 42. Since Adina's normal shoe size is also 9, we can set up a proportion to find her rock-climbing shoe size.\n9 (normal shoe size) / 42 (Lynn's rock-climbing shoe size) = x / y (Adina's rock-climbing shoe size)\nNow, we can cross multiply to solve for y (Adina's rock-climbing shoe size).\n9 * y = 42 * x\nDividing both sides by 9, we get:\ny = (42 * x) / 9\nSimplifying further:\ny = 4.67x\nSince we want a whole number for Adina's rock-climbing shoe size, we round x down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, x = 4.\nSubstituting x = 4 into the equation, we get:\ny = 4.67 * 4\ny = 18.68\nSince Adina cannot rent a fraction of a rock-climbing shoe size, we round y down to the nearest whole number.

        " \n#### Explanation: \nSince Lynn's rock-climbing shoe-size is 42 and she normally wears size 9, we need to determine the ratio between the two sizes. We can do this by dividing the rock-climbing shoe-size by the normal shoe-size. In this case, the ratio is 42/9 = 42/9 = 4/1 or simply 4. \nTherefore, if Adina is normally size 9, she should rent shoes that are 4 sizes larger, which is 9 + (4 * 1) = 9 + 4 = <<9+(4*1)=13>>13.",
