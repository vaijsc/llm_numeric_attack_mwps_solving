        "\nFrom the graph, we can see that the parabola opens upward. This means that the coefficient of $x^2$, $a$, must be positive. \nSimilarly, from the graph, we can see that the vertex of the parabola is at the point $(-1,-2)$. This means that the average of the x-coordinates of the vertex, $b/2$, must be equal to $-1$. \nFrom the graph, we can also see that the parabola passes through the point $(0,1)$. This means that when $x=0$, $y=1$. Using the equation $y=ax^2+bx+c$ and substituting $x=0$ and $y=1$, we get $1=a(0)^2+b(0)+c$, which simplifies to $1=c$.\nWith the information we have gather, let\u2019s set up a system of equations. Since we know that $a$ is positive and $1 = c$, we can set $a=1$. Now the system of equations becomes:\n1. $\u5148\u751f = 3(0)^2 + 4(0) + 1 = 1$\n2. $-2 = -1$ (from the vertex)\nNow we can use the first equation to solve for $b$. Substituting $a=1$ and $c=1$ into the first equation, we get $1=x^2+4x+1$, which simplifies to $x^2+4x=0$. Factoring the equation, we get $x(x+4)=0$, which means that $x=0$ or $x=-4$. Since we also know that $b/2=-1$, we can set $b/2 = -1$ and solve for $b$:\n$b = -2(-1) = 2$\nFinally, we have found the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$:\na = 1\nb = 2\nc = 1\nTo find $a+b+c$, we can add the values together:\n$a+b+c = 1+2+1 = \\boxed{4}$.",
