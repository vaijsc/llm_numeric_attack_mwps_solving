        " To find the possible values of $n$, we need to determine when the quadratic expression $3x^2 + nx + 8$ has two distinct real roots.

        "\nTo find the range of possible values for $n$, we should start by expanding and simplifying the quadratic expression.

Comparing to the given expression $3x^2 + nx + 8$, we see that $a = 3$, $b = n$, and $c = 8$. To obtain the roots of the quadratic equation, the discriminant $b^2 - 4ac$ must be positive. Otherwise, the equation will not have two distinct real roots.

Calculating the products inside the parentheses first, we have $$9n^2 - 96 > 0.$$Subtracting $96$ from both sides gives $9n^2 > 96$. Dividing both sides by $9$ gives $n^2 > 10$.
