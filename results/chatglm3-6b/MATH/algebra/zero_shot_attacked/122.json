        " \nThe midpoint of a line segment with endpoints $(x,y)$ and $(-9,1)$ is given by the coordinates $\\left(\\frac{x-9}{2},\\frac{y+1}{2}\\right)$.\nTherefore, we can set up the following equations based on the given information:\n$\\frac{x-9}{2}=9$\n$\\frac{y+1}{2}=-5$\nLet's solve for $x$ and $y$.\nFrom the first equation, we can add 9 to both sides to get $x-9=18$. Adding 9 to both sides again, we find $x=27$.\nFrom the second equation, we can subtract $-5$ from both sides to get $y-1=-10$. Adding 1 to both sides, we find $y=-9$.\nTherefore, the x-coordinate of the midpoint is 27, and the y-coordinate of the midpoint is -9.\nThe answer is: (27,-9)",
