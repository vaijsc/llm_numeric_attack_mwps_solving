        " To find the 21st term, we first need to find the common difference of the arithmetic sequence.\nWe are given that the 7th term is 50, and the 11th term is 60. \nThe formula to find the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is given by: a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d, where 'a_n' is the n-th term, 'a_1' is the first term, and d is the common difference.\nLet's rearrange the formula to solve for d:\nd = (a_n - a_1) / (n - 1) \nWe know that when n = 7, a_7 = 50, and when n = 11, a_11 = 60. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\nd = (60 - 50) / (11 - 7) = 10 / 4 = 2.5\nNow that we have the common difference, we can find the 21st term by plugging in n = 21 into the formula:\na_21 = 50 + (21 - 1)(2.5) = 50 + 20(2.5) = 50 + 50 = 100\nTherefore, the 21st term of the arithmetic sequence is 100.",

        "\nTo solve this problem, we can start by understanding what an arithmetic sequence is.
