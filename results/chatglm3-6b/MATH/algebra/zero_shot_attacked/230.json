        "\nThe given point $(5,9)$ indicates that when $x=5$, $y=9$. \nTo find the corresponding point on the graph of $y=f(-x)$, we need to find the point $(x,y)$ such that $y=f(-x)$. \nSince $f(x)$expr is linear, if $(5,9)$ is on the graph of $y=f(x)$, then the slope of the line\u5174 will be the same. \nIn other words, if $f(5)=9$, then $f'(5)=2$. \nSince $f(-x)$, the slope will also be 2. \nNow let\u2019s find $x$. Since the point $(5,9)$ is on the graph of $y=f(x)$, we can use the equation $y=f(x)$ to find $f(-x)$. \nSubstituting $f(-x)$ for $y$, we have $f(-x)=f(x)$. \nSetting $x=5$ in the equation, we get $f(-5)=f(5)=9$. \nTherefore, the point $(-5,9)$ must be on the graph of $y=f(-x)$. \nFinally, the sum of the coordinates of this point is $-5+9=\\boxed{4}$.",

        " \n#### Explanation:\n##### Step 1: Find the coordinates of the point (-5,9) on the graph of y = f(x). We can see from the graph of y = f(x) that plugging in x = 5 gives us y = 9, so the coordinates of the point (-5,9) are (-5,9).\n### Step 2: Since the point has x = -5 and y = 9, it must also be on the graph of y = f(-x). By replacing x with -x in the equation y = f(x), we get y = f(-x). \nSo the point of coordinates that must have coordinates (-5,9) on the graph of y = f(-x) is (-5,9).",

        "\nWe know that $(5,9)$ is on the graph of $y=f(x)$, which means that $f(5)=9$. To find the point $(x,-y)$ on the graph of $y=f(-x)$, we need to find the coordinates of the point $(x,-y)$ such that $-y=f(-x)$. \nSince $f(5)=9$, we have $-9=f(-5)$. This means that $(-5,-9)$ is on the graph of $y=f(-x)$.\nTo find the sum of the coordinates of the point $(-5,-9)$, we simply add $-5$ and $-9$:\n$-5 + (-9) = -14$.\nTherefore, the sum of the coordinates of the point $(-5,-9)$ is $\\boxed{-14}$.",
        " The original function $y = f(x)$ can be written as $y = a \\cdot x^2 + b \\cdot x + c$.\nThus, the graph of $y = f(x)$ is a parabola with vertex $(h, a \\cdot h^2 + b \\cdot h + c)$.\nSince the point $(5, 9)$ is on the graph of $y = f(x)$, we plug $x = 5$ and $y = 9$ into the function to get $9 = a \\cdot 5^2 + b \\cdot 5 + c$. This gives us the equation $25a + 5b + c = 9$.\nTo find the point on the graph of $y = f(-x)$, we substitute $x$ with $-x$ in the function $y = f(x)$. This gives us $y = a \\cdot (-x)^2 + b \\cdot (-x) + c = a \\cdot x^2 - b \\cdot x + c$.\nThe vertex of the parabola $y = f(-x)$ is $(-h, a \\cdot (-h)^2 + b \\cdot (-h) + c) = (-h, a \\cdot h^2 - b \\cdot h + c)$.\nSince the point $(5, 9)$ lies on the graph of $y = f(x)$, it must also lie on the graph of $y = f(-x)$. This means that $(5, 9)$ must be a point on the graph of $y = a \\cdot x^2 - b \\cdot x + c$.\nSo, we substitute $x = 5$ and $y = 9$ into the equation $y = a \\cdot x^2 - b \\cdot x + c$ to get $9 = a \\cdot 5^2 - 5b + c = 25a - 5b + c$.\nNow we have the system of equations:\n$$25a + 5b + c = 9$$\n$$25a - 5b + c = 9$$\nSubtracting the second equation from the first equation, we get $10b = 0$, so $b = 0$.\nSubstituting $b = 0$ into one of the equations, we get $2",
        " \nTo find the point that is on the graph of $y=f(-x)$ and has coordinates $(x,y)$, we can substitute $x$ with $-x$ in the expression for $y=f(x)$:\n$y = f(x) = f(-x)$\nTherefore, when $x = -5$, the corresponding value of $y$ will be equal to the value of $y$ when $x = 5$, which is 9. So, we can conclude that the point $(-5,9)$ must be on the graph of $y=f(-x)$. To find the sum of the coordinates of this point, we add $(-5)$ and $(9)$:\n$-5 + 9 = \\boxed{4}$.",
        "\n#### A method to solve this question could be to reflect the point $(5, 9)$ across the x-axis and find the corresponding point on the graph of $y = f(-x)$. \nAfter reflecting the point across the x-axis, we get the point $(5, -9)$. \nSo the point which must be on the graph of $y = f(-x)$ is $(5, -9)$. \nNow, let's find the sum of the coordinates of this point. \nThe sum of the x-coordinate and y-coordinate is $5 + (-9) = \\boxed{-4}$.",

So the point that is downloaded $5$ units to the left of $(5,9)$ on the graph of $y=f(x)$ will be $(-5,4)$.\nNow, we need to find the sum of the coordinates of this point.\nThe sum of the coordinates of $(-5,4)$ is $(-5)+4 = \\boxed{-1}$.",

This means that $(-5,9)$ must be on the graph of $y=f(-x)$.\nNow, we can find the sum of the coordinates of the point $(-5,9)$. \nSum = $-5 + 9 = 4$.\nTherefore, the sum of the coordinates of the point $(-5,9)$ on the graph of $y=f(-x)$ is $\\boxed{4}$.",
