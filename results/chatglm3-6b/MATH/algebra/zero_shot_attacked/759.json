        "\n#### Explanation:\nWhen we subtract $g(x)$ from $f(x)$, the resulting polynomial will be a new polynomial every time $x$ is replaced with $g(x)$, due to the difference in the degrees of the two polynomials. Since $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $2$, replacing $x$ with $g(x)$ will lead to a polynomial of degree $2$, thus we cannot conclusion the degree of the resulting polynomial.",
        "\nThe degree of a polynomial is the highest power of $x$ that appears in its expression. Since $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3 and $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 2, it means that $f(x)$ has an additional $x^3$ term compared to $g(x)$. Therefore, $f(x) - g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $\\boxed{3}$.",
