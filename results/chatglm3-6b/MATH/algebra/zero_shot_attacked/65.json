        " \nTo find the value of |m - n|, we need to solve for m and n first. We have the equations:\nmn = 11 (Equation 1)\nm + n = 8 (Equation 2)\nTo solve for m and n, we can multiply Equation 2 by 2 and subtract Equation 1 from it:\nm + 2n = 16\nm = 16 - 2n\nSubstituting this value of m into Equation 1, we get:\n(16 - 2n)(n) = 11\n16n - 2n^2 = 11\nRearranging the equation, we have:\n2n^2 - 16n + 11 = 0\nWe can solve this quadratic equation by factoring or using the quadratic formula.

        "\nFirst, we can solve for the values of $m$ and $n$ by considering their possible factor pairs. The only factor pairs of $11$ are $(1,11)$ and $(-1,-11)$. However, we also have the condition that $m+n=8$. \nIf we assume $m=1$ and $n=11$, we have $1+11=12$, which is inconvenient since $12\\ne 8$. \nIf we assume $m=-1$ and $n=-11$, we have $-1+(-11)=-12$, which is also inconvenient since $-12\\ne 8$.\nSince both of these assumptions result in inconvenient values, we need to reassess our factor pairs. However, we can observe that $(m,n)$ and $(n,m)$ must be equal due to the commutative property of multiplication. Therefore, the only valid solution is $(m,n)=(1,11)$ or $(-1,-11)$.\nIn either case, we have $m-n=(1-11)=-10$. Hence, the answer is $\\boxed{10}$.",
