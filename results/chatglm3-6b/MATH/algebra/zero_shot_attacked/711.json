This means the age difference between them is $8x - x = 76$.\nStep 4: Simplifying the equation, we get $7x = 76$.\nStep 5: Dividing both sides of the equation by 7, we find $x = 11$.\nSo, Andrew is currently $\\boxed{11}$ years old.",
        " \nAndrew's age is represented by $x$. \nAccording to the given information, Andrew's grandfather's age is $8x$. \nSince Andrew was born when his grandfather was 76, the age difference between them is always $8x-x=76$. \nSo, let's solve for $x$. We add $x$ to both sides: $$76 = 7x$$ Divide by 7: $$x=\\frac{76}{7}$$ Therefore, Andrew is $\\boxed{\\frac{76}{7}}$ years old now.",
        " Let's assume Andrew's age is x.\nAccording to the given information, Andrew's grandfather's age (G) is eight times Andrew's age (x), so G = 8x.\nWe also know that when Andrew was born, his grandfather was already 76 years old. This means the age difference between Andrew and his grandfather is 76 years.\nSo, Andrew's age (x) + 76 = his grandfather's age (G). \nSubstituting the value of G from the first equation into the second equation:\nx + 76 = 8x\nNow we can solve for x by isolating it on one side of the equation.\nSubtract x from both sides of the equation:\nx = 76\nTherefore, Andrew is currently 76 years old.",
        "\nLet's represent Andrew's age as \"x\" years. According to the given conditions, Andrew's grandfather is 8x years old. We also know that Andrew's grandfather was 76 years old when Andrew was born, which means the age difference between them is 76-x years.\nWe can set up an equation based on the given conditions:\n8x - x = 76 - x\n7x = 76\nx = 10.5\nTherefore, Andrew is currently 10.5 years old.",

        "\nAndrew's age is x years old.\nHis grandfather's age is 76 - x years old.\nAccording to the problem, Andrew's grandfather's age is eight times Andrew's age. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n76 - x = 8x\nNow that we have the equation, let's solve for x by simplifying and rearranging it:\n76 - 8x = x\n96 - 9x = 0\nTo isolate x, we divide both sides by 9:\n96 - 9x / 9 = 0 / 9\n10.6667 - x = 0\nTo solve for x, we subtract 10.6667 from both sides:\n10.6667 - x - 10.6667 = 0 - 10.6667\n-x = -10.6667\nFinally, we multiply both sides by -1 to solve for x:\nx = 10.6667\nSo, Andrew is currently 10.6667 years old.",
