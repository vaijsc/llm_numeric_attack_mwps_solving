        " \n#### Solution: socat47890\nThe logarithm base 2 of 4^8 is the value of x. \n#### Explanation:\nWe know that logarithm base 2 of 4^8 can be written as log2(4^8). Using the property of logarithms, we can rewrite this as 8*log2(4). Since 4 = 2^2, we can simplify further to 8*log2(2^2). Using the property of logarithms again, this is equal to 8*2*log2(2).
