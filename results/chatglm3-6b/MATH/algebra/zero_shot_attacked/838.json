        " \nTo solve this problem, we need to use the order of operations, which states that we should simplify the expression inside the parentheses first, and then the expression inside the second set of parentheses.\n\u3002\nThe expression inside the first set of parentheses is $50\\%$ of $200\\%$.\nTo calculate this, we need to multiply the percentages, so $50\\% = \\frac{50}{100} = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $200\\% = \\frac{200}{100} = 2$.\nNow we can multiply these two values together: $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 = 1$.\nSo, $50\\%$ of $200\\%$ is equal to $1$.\nNext, we need to calculate $200\\%$ of $70$.\nTo do this, we need to multiply the percentages: $200\\% = \\frac{200}{100} = 2$.\nNow we can multiply this value by $70$: $2 \\times 70 = 140$.\nSo, $200\\%$ of $70$ is equal to $140$.\nFinally, we need to calculate $50\\%$ of $70$: $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 70 = 35$.\nThus, $50\\%$ of $200\\%$ of $70$ is equal to $\\boxed{140}$.",
