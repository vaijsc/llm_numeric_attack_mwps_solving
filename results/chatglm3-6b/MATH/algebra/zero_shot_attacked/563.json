        " \nWe can simplify the equation by first rewriting $256^\\frac{1}{2}$ as the square root of 256. The square root of 256 is 16, so our equation becomes $4^{2x} = 16$.\nTo solve for $x$, we can take the logarithm of both sides of the equation. Since we are using base 4, we will use the logarithm base 4. Using the property $\\log_a b^c = c \\log_a b$, the equation becomes $2x \\log_4 4 = \\log_4 16$. Simplifying, we have $2x = \\log_4 16$.\nFinally, solving for $x$ gives us $x = \\boxed{4}$.",

        "  First, we can simplify $\\frac{256}{2}$, which is equal to $\\sqrt{256}.$ We can then write $\\sqrt{256}$ as $2^6$ to have $\\frac{256}{2}=\\sqrt{256}=2^6$.   Applying the same logic to $4^{2x}$, we can write it as $(2^2)^{2x}=2^{2(2x)}$.  Setting these equal to $2^6$, we must have $2^{2(2x)}=2^6$, which implies $2(2x)=6$.  Solving this equation for $x$ gives $x=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}$.\nLet's verify our solution by plugging it back into the original equation. We have $4^{2x} = 4^{\\frac{3}{2}}$. We can simplify this as $2^{8x} = 2^{\\frac{6}{2}}$. Again, applying the same logic that $\\sqrt{256}=2^6$, we can write this as $2^{8x} = 2^6$.

Therefore, $4^{2x} = 24^{\\frac{3}{4}}$.  Since $4 = 2^2$, we can write $4^{2x} = (2^2)^{2x} = 2^{4x}$.  Therefore $2^{4x} = 24^{\\frac{3}{4}}$.  By comparing the bases, we know that $4x = \\log_2{24^{\\frac{3}{4}}}$.  We know that $24 = 2^6$, so $24^{\\frac{3}{4}} = (2^6)^{\\frac{3}{4}} = 2^{6\\cdot\\frac{3}{4}} = 2^9$.
