The proportion is:\nMonica's height / Monica's shadow length = Pine tree's height / Pine tree's shadow length\nLet's use the given values:\n7 feet / 2 feet = Pine tree's height / 34 feet\nNow we can cross multiply to find the height of the pine tree:\n7 feet * 34 feet = 2 feet * Pine tree's height\n242 feet = 2 feet * Pine tree's height\nDividing both sides of the equation by 2 feet gives us:\nPine tree's height = 242 feet / 2 feet\nPine tree's height = 121 feet.\nSo, the height of the pine tree is 121 feet.\n#### 121#### 121\nThe answer is: 121",
