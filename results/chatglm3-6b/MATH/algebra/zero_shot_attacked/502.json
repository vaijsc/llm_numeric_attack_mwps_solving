        " The value of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula S = n/2(a + l), where S is the sum, a is the first term, and l is the last term. \nIn this case, the first term (a) is 38, and the last term (l) is 86. \nTo find the value of the common difference (d), we can subtract the first term from the last term. d = l - a = 86 - 38 = 48. \nNow we can find the number of terms (n) by dividing the difference of the last term and the first term by the common difference. \nn = l - a + d / d = 86 - 38 + 48 / 48 = 48. \nFinally, we can calculate the sum of the series using the formula S = n/2(a + l):\nS = 48/2(38 + 86) = 24(124) = 2976. \nTherefore, the value of the arithmetic series 38 + 40 + 42 + ... + 86 is 2976.",
