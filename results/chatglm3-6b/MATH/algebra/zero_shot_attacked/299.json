        "\nFirst, we can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by 2, thus obtaining $2^{x+2} \\div 2 = 52 \\div 2$. Simplifying both the left and right sides gives us $2^{x+2} = 26$. To isolate $x$, we need to subtract 2 from both sides, so $2^{x+2} - 2 = 26 - 2$. Calculating the left side gives $2^{x+2} - 2 = 24$.\nSince $24 = 2^3$, we know that $2^{x+2} = 2^3$.\nBy comparing the exponents of both sides, we can deduce that $x+2 = 3$.\nTo solve for $x$, we subtract 2 from both sides $x+2 = 3$ to get $x = 1$.\nTherefore, the integer $x$ that satisfies the equation is $\\boxed{1}$.",

        " \nWe need to write 52 as a power of 2. The prime factorization of 52 is $2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 26$. To make it a perfect power of two, $26$ must be removed and replaced by one less 2. As $26=2\\cdot 13$, we need to remove the two 2's. Thus 52=2^2\\cdot 26$. Substituting into $2^{x+2}=52$, we have $2^{x+2}=2^2\\cdot 26$= $2^2\\cdot 2^4 \\cdot 2$= $2^6$. 2 raised to the sixth power is equal to $64$, not 52.  \nSo the solution to the given equation is $\\boxed{2}$.",
