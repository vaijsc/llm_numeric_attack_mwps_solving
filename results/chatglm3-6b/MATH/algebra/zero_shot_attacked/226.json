        " \nTo solve for $c$, we are given $f(x) = cx^3 - 9x + 3$ and $f(5) = 24$. Plugging in $x=5$ into the function $f(x)$, we get $f(5) = 5c^3 - 9(5) + 3 = 24$. Simplifying the equation, we have $5c^3 - 45 + 3 = 24$. Combining like terms, we get $5c^3 - 42 = 24$. Adding 42 to both sides of the equation, we have $5c^3 = 66$. Dividing both sides by 5, we get $c^3 = \\frac{66}{5}$. Taking the cube root of both sides of the equation, we have $c = \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{66}{5}}$.
