We can use the rational root theorem to check possible rational roots. The possible values are the factors of the constant term $10$, namely $\\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm5, \\pm10$. We should check these values to see if they divide $x^7+4x+10=0$ without leaving a remainder.\nBy inspection, none of the possible values divide $x^7+4x+10=0$. Therefore, the rational root theorem tells us that there is no rational root to the equation.\nSince there is no rational root, the x-coordinate of the zeros must be complex numbers. To find the real zeros, we can use the Newton-Raphson method or synthetic division. We will use synthetic division.\n$$\\require{numpy}\\\u5c14\u5fb7{x=(7)}^7-7(7)+7\\Big|{-3}\\Bigg]$$\nX\u4e03\u6708\u518d\u8005\u4e03\u662fX\u76847\u6b21\u65b9-7X+7\nSynthetic division gives rise to an synthetic $7$  $-2$, then X with the >\u8bd7synthetic division gives us an answer of  X$\\frac{-7 onto 4}$.

To do that, we look at the space graph of the function . As we can see, X zero is the point of maximum $X$ and minimum $-X$.\nTherefore, we know that  X zero forms 0, so we need to find the zeros that have a positive  X term and a negative $X term To look at the",
        " \nThe first step is to find the $x$-coordinates of the points of intersection.

We simply add them together: $$2+5=\\boxed{7}$$. The answer is 7",
        "\nTo find the points of intersection, we set the two equations equal to each other and solve for $x$:\n$x^7 - 7x + 7 = -3$\nLet's simplify and solve for $x$:\n$x^7 - 7x + 10 = 0$\nTo solve this equation, we can either factor it or use the quadratic formula. However, looking at the equation, we can see that it does not factor easily. So, let\u2019s use the quadratic formula:\n$x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$\nIn this case, $a = 1$, $b = -7$, and $c = 10$.\nPlugging in these values, we get:\n$x = \\frac{-(-7) \\pm \\sqrt{(-7)^2 - 4(1)(10)}}{2(1)}$\nSimplifying further,\n$x = \\frac{7 \\pm \\sqrt{49 - 40}}{2}$\n$x = \\frac{7 \\pm \\sqrt{9}}{2}$\n$x = \\frac{7 \\pm 3}{2}$\nThis gives us two possible values for $x$:\n$x = 3$ and $x = 4$\nSo, the two points of intersection are $(3, -3)$ and $(4, -3)$.\nTo find the sum of the $x$-coordinates of these two points, we add $3 + 4$.\nTherefore, the sum of the $x$-coordinates is $3 + 4 = \\boxed{7}$.",
        "\nTo find the points where the two graphs intersect, we set them equal to each other and solve for $x$.\nIn other words, we need to find $x$ values satisfying the equation\n\\[x^7 - 7x + 7=-3.\\] Since $-3$ is negative, it means the graphs $y=x^7-7x+7$ and $y=-3$ do not intersect at any particular $x$-values greater than $-3$.\nBut when we set $y=-3$ equal to $y=x^7-7x+7$ we get\n\\[-3 = x^7 - 7x + 7,\\] so we have $x^7 - 7x + 10=0$.\nBy the Rational Root Theorem, factors of 10 as roots of $x^7 - 7x + 10$ are $\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 5, \\pm 10$. By testing these values, we find that $x=2$ is a root, in between $-3$ and 2 we do not have another real root, and $x=-2$ is a root, so $x^7 - 7x + 10=(x-2)(x+2)(x-5)(x-1)$. Factoring gives\n\\[x^7 - 7x + 10 = (x^2 - 4)(x^2 - 3)(x - 5).\\] At $x=2$, the expression $x^7-7x+7$ equals $-1$. At $x=2$, the expression $y = -3$ equals $-1$. So the two points of intersection are $(2,-1)$ and $(-2,-1)$, and the sum of their $x$-coordinates is $\\boxed{0}$.",
        "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the point of intersection between the graphs of $y = x^7 - 7x + 7$ and $y = -3$. The point of intersection occurs where the corresponding coordinates of $y$ are equal.\nComparing the two equations, we get \\[x^7 - 7x + 7 = -3.\\]\nSimplifying, we have \\[x^7 - 7x + 10 = 0.\\]\nTo find the solutions of this equation, we can use the substitution method or factor theorem method. Here, we try factoring the equation:\n\\[x^7 - 7x + 10 = (x-1)(x-1)(x^2 + 6x + 10).\\]\nThe factored equation gives us four quadratic factors: \\begin{align*}\nx-1 &= 1, \\\\\nx^2 + 6x + 10 &= 0.\n\\end{align*}\nThe first quadratic factor only gives one solution, $x=1$. For the second quadratic factor, we can solve it by factoring again: \\begin{align*}\nx^2 + 6x + 10 &= (x+2)(x+5).\n\\end{align*}\nAgain, the quadratic factor only gives one solution, $x=-2$. Therefore, there are two solutions for $x$: $x=1$ and $x=-2$.\nThe sum of these $x$-coordinates is $1+(-2)=\\boxed{-1}$.",

To be able to factor, we check if the discriminant, which is given by $b^2 - 4ac$, is negative. In this case:\n$(-7)^2 - 4(1)(10) = 49 - 40 = 9 > 0$\nSo, the higher degree quadratic equation $x^7 - 7x + 10$ does not factor nicely in the real numbers.  However, we can notice that this equation $x^7 - 7x + 10 = 0$ is a factorization of Perfect 7th powers of $x \\pm \\sqrt2x + \\sqrt2$ which are complex numbers.  We can also see that these complex roots (or quadratic roots) multiply depends on that of 7th degree polynomial roots, and we can see from $y = -3$ but actually  (-3 is the only number\u4e0a\u53f8 which when you raise to its power 7 will not yield a\u4e07\u91cc\u65e0\u6781\u6570, indeed, 9 is the number that does) that two complex roots contributes with -3 when added up.  After combined and simplified we discover three equations.\n$xN( \\pm \\sqrt2x + \\sqrt{2} )$ must equal zero.  \nThese equations will yield three values.

        "\n- To find the points where the graphs intersect, we set the two equations equal to each other and solve for $x$: \\begin{align*}\nx^7 - 7x + 7 &= -3.\n\\end{align*}To simplify the equation, we can add $3$ to both sides: \\begin{align*}\nx^7 - 7x + 10 &= 0.\n\\end{align*}I notice that the equation is cubic, so it might have a repeated root. To check if it has one, we can use the rational root theorem. According to the theorem, any rational root of the polynomial can be expressed in the form $\\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ is a factor of the constant term and $q$ is a factor of the leading coefficient. In this case, the factors are $1, 2, 5,$ and $10$.

So, there is no repeated root to find.\nSince the equation is not rational, we can catch the roots using a numerical method. We can use an online platform or software to find the roots of the equation. In general, when we have a polynomial of high degree, we can use numerical methods to find its roots.\nI suggest finding the roots using a calculator or online platform to see that the equation does not have any real roots. Therefore, the two points of intersection do not exist.\nAs there are no two points of intersection, there are no $x$-coordinates for the points. Thus, the sum of these $x$-coordinates is $\\boxed{0}$.",
        " \nTo find the $x$-coordinates of the two points where the graphs intersect, we need to set the two equations equal to each other and solve for $x$.\nSetting $x^7 - 7x + 7 = -3$, we can rearrange theequation to $-3 = -3x^7 + 7x - 7$.\nNext, let's isolate the $x^7$ term on one side of the equation to get $-3x^7 = 7x - 7$.\nDividing both sides by $-3$ gives $x^7 = \\frac{7}{3}x - \\frac{7}{3}$.\nNext, let's logarithm both sides of the equation, specifically taking the natural logarithm base $e$ of the left side: \n$\\log(x^7) = \\log(\\frac{7}{3}x - \\frac73)$.\nUsing the difference of logarithms formula, $\\log(A) - \\log(B) = \\log(A/B)$, the equation simplifies to $7\\log(x) = \\log\\left(\\frac{7}{3}x - \\frac{7}{3}\\right)$.\nDividing both sides by $7\\log(x)$ gives $\\log\\left(\\frac{7}{3}x - \\frac{7}{3}\\right) = \\log\\left(\\frac{7}{3}\\right)$.\nSince $\\log(a) = \\log\\left(\\frac{7}{3}\\right) = \\log\\left(\\frac{7}{3}\\right) + 1$, the above equation becomes:\n$7\\log(x) = 1$.\nFrom this, we can deduce that $x = e^{1/7}$.\nTherefore, the two $x$-coordinates of the points of intersection are $x = e^{1/7}$ and $x = e^{1/7}$.\nThe sum of these $x$-coordinates can be found by adding the two values:\n$e^{1/7} + e^{1/7} = 2e^{1/7}$.\nThus, the sum of the $x$-coordinates of the points of intersection is $2",

Therefore, by the Rational Root Theorem, $\\pm2$ must be the roots. \\begin{align*}\n\\pm 2(x-2) &= 0, \\\\\nx(x-2) &= 10.\n\\end{align*}The second equation is quadratic.

        " 2x - 2:\nTo find the coordinates of the two points where the graphs intersect, we need to solve the system of equations formed by the two equations:\nx^7 - 7x + 7 = y   (Equation 1)\ny = -3  (Equation 2)\nTo solve this system, we need to substitute Equation 2 into Equation 1:\nx^7 - 7x + 7 = -3\nNow, let's consider the given information. Since the sum of the $x$-coordinates of the two points of intersection is $3$, we can write the equation:\nx1 + x2 = 3\nLet's move on to the next step. The $y$-coordinate of a point on the graph of $y = x^7 - 7x + 7$ is the given value of $x$ raised to the power of $7$. Since we want to find the $x$-coordinates of the points of intersection, we need to solve the equation $x^7 - 7x + 7 = y$, which we have already done in the previous step. So, the $y$-coordinates of the two points of intersection are $7$ and $-3$. Therefore, we have the following equations:\nx1^7 - 7x1 + 7 = 7\nx2^7 - 7x2 + 7 = -3\nNow, let's consider the fact that $x1$ and $x2$ are the roots of the polynomial $t^7 - 7t + 7 = 0$. Using Vieta's formulas, we know that the sum of the roots is equal to the coefficient of $t^6$ divided by the coefficient of $t^7$ (which is 1). So, the sum of the roots is $\\frac{-(-7)}{1} = 7$. Since we are given that the sum of the $x$-coordinates is $3$, the remaining root must be $3$ (since the sum of two roots is $3$). So, the equation $7x^7 - 7x^6 + 7x^5 + 7x^4 + 7x^3 + 7x + 7 = 0$ tells us that there are no other possible values for $x$. Therefore,",
