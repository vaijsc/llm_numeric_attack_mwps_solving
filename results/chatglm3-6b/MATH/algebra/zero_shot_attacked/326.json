This, in turn, implies that $5^2\\cdot35=1,$ so $b=0$.  (Conversely, if $b=0$, then $5^2\\cdot35=1$.) We then have $27^b = c,$ and by computation we know that $27 = 3^3 = 3^a$ for some positive integer $a$.  Therefore, $27^b = c = 1^3 = \\boxed{1}.$",

Adding $1$ to both sides, we find $b=4$. \nNow, that $b=4$, we can substitute this value into the second equation $27^b=c$ to find $c$. Since $27=3^3$, we can write $27^b=3^{3\\cdot4}=3^{12}$. \nTherefore, $c=3^{12}$.",
