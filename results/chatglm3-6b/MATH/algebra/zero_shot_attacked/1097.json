So, the area of this rectangular plot is L \\* (L + 5) = L^2 + 5L sq ft.\nAccording to the problem, the area of the plot should be at least 700 sq ft. So, we can set up the following inequality:\nL^2 + 5L \u2265 700   (1)\nWe need to solve this inequality to find the possible values of L.\nTo simplify the inequality, we can rearrange it as follows:\nL^2 + 5L - 700 \u2265 0   (2)\nNow, let's solve inequality (2) by factoring or using the quadratic formula.\nFactors of -700: -1, -5, -7, 1, 5, 7, 10, -10, -14, -35, -70, -105, -350, -700.\nFrom the factors, we can see that the pair -1 and 700 is a factor. So, we can factorize the quadratic expression as follows:\nL^2 + 5L - 700 = (L - 5)(L + 140)\nNow, we can set each factor to be 0 to find the possible values of L.\nL - 5 = 0   or   L + 140 = 0\nL = 5   or   L = -140\nThe negative values of L don't make sense in this context, so we can discard them.\nTherefore, the possible values of L are L = 5 ft.\nSince the width is L + 5 ft, the width of the plot is 5 + 5 = 10 ft.\nSo, the width of the plot is 10 ft.",
