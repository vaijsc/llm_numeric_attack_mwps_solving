        " We can rewrite the quadratic expression in vertex form bycomplete the square: $x^2 - 8x + 3 = (x - 4)^2 - 5^2$.\nThe vertex form of the quadratic expression is given by $(x - h)^2 + k$, where $h$ is the $x$-coordinate of the vertex and $k$ is the $y$-coordinate of the vertex.\nThe vertex of the parabola $y = (x - 4)^2 - 5^2$ is at $(4, -5)$. To find the value of $x$ that gives the minimum value, we set the coefficient of $x^2$ to 0, which is $(4)^2 = 16$. $x = 4$ is the value that gives the minimum value for $x^2 - 8x + 3$. answer: \\boxed{4}",
        " To find the value of $x$ that will give the minimum value for the quadratic $x^2 - 8x + 3$, we can identify an x-coordinate that makes the coefficient of $x^2$ (which is 1) equal to 0. In other words, we want to find $x$ for which $x^2 - 8x + 3$ is a perfect square.\nStarting with $x^2 - 8x + 3$, let's find the x-coordinate $x$ that makes the coefficient of $x$ equal to 0 by setting $x^2 - 8x + 3 = n^2$ for some integer $n$.\nTo find $n$, we'll want to factor the quadratic as $(x - h)^2$ where $h$ is an integer. To do this, we'll first factor the quadratic as a difference of two squares $x^2 - 8x + 3 = (x - 4)(x - h)$.\nBy comparing coefficients, we have:\n\\begin{align*}\n-8 &= -2(4) \\\\\n3 &= -h + 4\n\\end{align*}\nSimplifying these equations, we have:\n\\begin{align*}\n2h &= 16 \\\\\nh &= 8\n\\end{align*}\nTherefore, $(h,n) = (8,6)$. So, the quadratic can be written as $x^2 - 8x + 3 = (x - 4)^2 - 6^2 = (x - 4)^2 - 36$.\nIn order for $(x - 4)^2$ to have the minimum value, $x$ must be at its maximum or minimum. The maximum and minimum values of $(x - 4)^2$ are $0$ and $0$, respectively.\nTherefore, the minimum value of $x^2 - 8x + 3$ occurs when $x = \\boxed{4}$.",
        "\nTo find the minimum value of the quadratic equation $x^2 - 8x + 3$, we can find the vertex of the parabola.\nThe $x$-coordinate of the vertex of a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c$ is given by $x = -\\frac{b}{2a}$.\nIn this case, $a = 1$ and $b = -8$, so the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $x = -\\frac{-8}{2(1)} = 4$.\nTherefore, the value of $x$ that will give the minimum value for $x^2 - 8x + 3$ is $\\boxed{4}$.The answer is: 4",
        " This expression is a quadratic function in the form $ax^2 + bx + c$, where $a = 1$, $b = -8$, and $c = 3$. We can therefore use the formula $x = -\\frac{b}{2a}$ to find the $x$-coordinate where the value of the quadratic is minimized. By substituting these values, we find that the minimum value occurs at $x = -\\frac{-8}{2(1)} = \\boxed{4}$.",
        " We can complete the square to determine the minimum value of the quadratic.\nTo complete the square for $x^2 - 8x + 3$, we need to add and subtract $(8/2)^2 = 16$.\nSo, $x^2 - 8x + 3$ can be rewritten as $(x^2 - 8x + 16) - 13$.\nThis is in the form $(x - 4)^2 - 13$.\nSince a square term cannot be negative, the minimum value of $(x - 4)^2$ is 0.\nTherefore, the minimum value of $x^2 - 8x + 3$ is $0 - 13 = -13$.\nTo find the value of $x$ that gives this minimum, we set $(x - 4)^2 = 0$ and solve for $x$.\nTaking the square root of both sides, we have $x - 4 = 0$.\nAdding 4 to both sides, we find $x = \\boxed{4}$.\nThe answer is: 4",

        " To find the minimum value of a quadratic function like $x^2 - 8x + 3$, we can analyze its coefficient of the $x^2$ term. If the coefficient is positive, the parabola opens upward, and the vertex represents the minimum value. If the coefficient is negative, the parabola opens downward, and the vertex represents the maximum value. In this case, the coefficient is positive, so the parabola opens upward.\nWe can use vertex formula to find the value of $x$ for the vertex of the parabola. \nThe vertex formula is $\\left(-\\frac{b}{2a}, f\\left(-\\frac{b}{2a}\\right)\\right)$.\nFor the quadratic $x^2 - 8x + 3$, we have $a = 1$, $b = -8$, and $c = 3$.\nPlugging these values into the vertex formula, we get $\\left(-\\frac{-8}{2(1)}, f\\left(-\\frac{-8}{2(1)}\\right)\\right) = \\left(4, f(4)\\right)$.\nWe can compute the value of $f(4)$ by plugging $x = 4$ into the quadratic function. $f(4) = 4^2 - 8(4) + 3 = 16 - 32 + 3 = \\boxed{-15}$.\nTherefore, the value of $x$ that will give the minimum value for $x^2 - 8x + 3$ is $x = 4$, and the minimum value is $f(4) = \\boxed{-15}$.",

        " We complete the square to transform the quadratic expression:\nWe start by factoring out the lowest coefficient of $x^2$, which is 1. The value of the squared term is 1, which is nonnegative. The square of a real number is also nonnegative whenever that number is nonnegative.  Some numbers have the special properties that their square is equal to zero (0 must be excluded to avoid counting the zero value we'll see later).  Some numbers have the special properties that their square is equal to a constant, up to changing sign. This constant is achieved when the number is at its maximum.
