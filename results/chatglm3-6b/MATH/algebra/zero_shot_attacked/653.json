        "\nLet's use algebra to solve this problem. Let's assume that David worked for x hours. Alan worked three times as many hours as David, so Alan worked 3x hours.\nAccording to the problem, Alan and David each place 40 bricks per hour. Therefore, the total number of bricks placed by Alan is 40 * 3x = 120x. The total number of bricks placed by David is 40x.\nThe total number of bricks placed by both of them is the sum of the number of bricks placed by Alan and David, which is 600.\nTherefore, we can set up the equation: 120x + 40x = 600.\nCombining like terms, we get: 160x = 600.\nDividing both sides by 160, we get: x = 4.\nSo, David worked 4 hours.\n#### 4\nThe answer is: 4",
        "\nLet's assume that David worked x hours. Since Alan worked three times as many hours as David, Alan worked 3x hours.\nTogether, Alan and David placed 40 bricks/hour * (3x + x) hours = 40 bricks/hour * 4x hours = 160x bricks.\nWe know that the total number of bricks placed is 600, so 160x = 600\nTo find x, we divide both sides of the equation by 160: x = 600 / 160 = 3.75.\nHowever, since we can't have a fraction of an hour, we round down to the nearest whole number. David worked 3 hours.\nTo find the number of bricks David laid, we multiply 40 bricks/hour * 3 hours = 120 bricks.\nSo, David laid 120 bricks.\n#### 120\nThe answer is: 120",
        "\nLet's denote the number of hours David worked as x. Then Alan worked 3x hours. Altogether, they worked x + 3x = 4x hours.\nSince Alan places 40 bricks per hour, and David places 40 bricks per hour, the total number of bricks placed by Alan and David is 40 * 4x = 160x.\nThe total number of bricks placed is 600. Therefore, 160x = 600.\nDividing both sides of the equation by 160 gives us x = 600 / 160 = <<600/160=3.75>>3.75\nTherefore, David laid 40 * 3.75 = <<40*3.75=140>>140 bricks. Answer: \\boxed{140}.",
        "\nAlan worked three times as many hours as David, which means David worked 1/3 of the hours Alan worked. This means David worked 1/3 * 3 = <<1/3*3=1>>1 hour.\nAlan placed 40 bricks per hour, so in 1 hour he placed 40 * 1 = <<40*1=40>>40 bricks.\nThe total number of bricks placed by Alan and David is 600. So David laid 600 - 40 = <<600-40=560>>560 bricks.\nTherefore, David laid 560 bricks.dp bulb{size:100%;}",
        "\nLet's use algebra to solve the problem. \nLet's say David worked for x hours. Since Alan worked three times as many hours as David, Alan worked 3x hours.\nEach hour, Alan places 40 bricks, so in 3x hours, Alan places 40 * 3x = 120x bricks.\nEach hour, David places 40 bricks, so in x hours, David places 40 * x = 40x bricks.\nTogether, Alan and David place 120x + 40x = 160x bricks.\nWe are given that the total number of bricks placed is 600. So, 160x = 600.\nWe can solve this equation by dividing both sides by 160: x = 600 / 160 = 3.6666666666666664.\nSince we can't have a fraction of an hour, we can assume that David worked for 4 hours. Substituting x = 4 into the equation: 160 * 4 = 640.\nTherefore, David laid 640 bricks.\n#### 640\nThe answer is: 640",
        " Let's assign variables to the amount of time David worked and the amount of bricks David placed. Let d be the number of hours David worked and 40d be the number of bricks David placed.\nAlan worked three times as many hours as David and placed three times the number of bricks, so let a be the number of hours Alan worked and 40a be the number of bricks Alan placed. Given that Alan worked three times as many hours as David, we have the equation: a = 3d.\nThe total number of bricks placed by Alan and David is 600. So we have the equation:\n40a + 40d = 600\nWe also know that Alan worked three times as many hours as David, and the number of bricks placed by Alan and David match each other with the equation:\n40a = 40d\nLet's solve for d using this equation. divide both sides of the equation by 40:\na = d\nNow, substitute a = d into the first equation:\na = 3d\na = a\n3d = 3d\nSo, d = d\nNow let's find the value of d from 40d = 600. divide both sides of the equation by 40:\nd = 600 / 40\nd = 15\nSo, David worked 15 hours.\nSince Alan worked three times as many hours as David and the number of bricks placed by Alan and David match each other with the equation:\n40a = 40d\n40a = 40 \\* 15\n40a = 600\ndivide both sides of the equation by 40:\na = 600 / 40\na = 15\nSo, Alan worked 15 hours.\nFinally, to find out how many bricks David laid, we substitute d = 15 into the equation 40d = 600.\n40d = 40 \\* 15\n40d = 600\nd = 600 / 40\nd = 15\nSo, David laid 15 bricks.\n",
        "\nLet's assume David worked x hours. Since Alan worked three times as many hours as David, Alan worked 3x hours.\nBoth Alan and David place 40 bricks per hour, so in x hours David laid x * 40 = 40x bricks.\nIn 3x hours Alan laid 3x * 40 = 120x bricks.\nTogether they laid 600 bricks, so 40x + 120x = 600.\nCombining like terms, 160x = 600.\nDividing both sides by 160, x = 4.\nSo David laid 4 * 40 = 160 bricks.\n#### 160\nThe answer is: 160",

Since Alan worked three times as many hours as David, we have:  a = 3d  The total number of bricks placed by both Alan and David is 600, so we have: 2(40a + 40d) = 600  By simplifying this equation, we get: 80a + 80d = 600  Since we know that a = 3d, we can substitute that into the equation: 80(3d) + 80d = 600  Collect like terms to get: 240d + 80d = 600  Combine like terms to get: 320d = 600  To solve for d, we divide both sides of the equation by 320: d = 600 / 320  Since d is the number of hours David worked, David laid 600 / 320 = <<600/320=1.875>>1.875 bricks.",
