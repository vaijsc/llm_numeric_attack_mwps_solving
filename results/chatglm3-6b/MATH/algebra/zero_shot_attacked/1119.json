        "\nFirst, let's find the common difference of the arithmetic sequence. The fourth term is the second term plus 2 times the common difference, and the eighth term is the second term plus 6 times the common difference.\nLet the first term be a_1 and the common difference be d.\nSo, the fourth term is a_1 + 2d = 400\nAnd the eighth term is a_1 + 6d = 500\nWe can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate a_1:\n(a_1 + 6d) - (a_1 + 2d) = 500 - 400\n4d = 100\nd = 25\nNow that we know the common difference, we can find the sixth term by adding 5 times the common difference to the second term:\na_6 = a_1 + 5d\na_6 = a_1 + 5(25)\na_6 = a_1 + 125\nSince we don't have the value of a_1, we cannot determine the exact value of the sixth term.\n#### 125\nThe answer is: 125",
        " Let the first term of the arithmetic sequence be $a$ and the common difference be $d$.\nThen, the fourth term is $a + 3d = 400$ (Equation 1).\nThe eighth term is $a + 7d = 500$ (Equation 2).\nTo find the sixth term, we need to find the common difference $d$.\nWe can solve Equation 1 for $a$ and Equation 2 for $a$, and then substitute them into Equation 1 to eliminate $a$ and solve for $d$.\nFrom Equation 1, we get $a = 400 - 3d$.\nSubstituting this into Equation 2, we get $(400 - 3d) + 7d = 500$.\nCombining like terms, we get $400 + 4d = 500$.\nSubtracting 400 from both sides, we get $4d = 100$.\nDividing both sides by 4, we get $d = 25$.\nNow we can find the sixth term by substituting $d = 25$ into Equation 1:\n$6 = a + 5d$\n$6 = a + 125$\nSubtracting 125 from both sides, we get $a = -119$.\nTherefore, the sixth term of the arithmetic sequence is $-119 + 5(25) = \\boxed{88}$.",
        "\nTo find the common difference (d) of an arithmetic sequence, we can subtract the eighth term from the fourth term and then divide the result by 4.\n400 - 500 = -100\n-100 \u00f7 4 = -25\nThe common difference (d) of the arithmetic sequence is -25.\nTo find the sixth term, we can add 5 times the common difference to the fourth term.\n400 + 5(-25) = 400 - 125 = 275\nThe sixth term of the arithmetic sequence is 275.\nSo, the final answer is: 275",
        "\nTo find the common difference of the arithmetic sequence, we first need to find the difference between any two terms.

        " To get the sixth term, we need to find the common difference of the arithmetic sequence first. The formula to find the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is: a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d, where a_n is the nth term, a_1 is the first term, n is the position of the term, and d is the common difference. \nWe are given that the fourth term, a_4, is 400. Using the formula, we can write:\na_4 = a_1 + (4-1)d = 400\nSimilarly, we are given that the eighth term, a_8, is 500. Using the formula, we can write:\na_8 = a_1 + (8-1)d = 500\nNow we have a system of two equations with two variables:\na_1 + (4-1)d = 400\na_1 + (8-1)d = 500\nSubtracting the first equation from the second equation, we can eliminate the first term (a_1):\n(a_1 + (8-1)d) - (a_1 + (4-1)d) = 500 - 400\nThis simplifies to:\nd = 100\nNow we have the common difference (d). However, we also need to find the first term (a_1). Let's go back to the first term and the fourth term in the equations:\na_1 = a_4 - (4-1)d\nSubstituting the given values, we have:\na_1 = 400 - (4-1)(100)\nSimplifying, we find:\na_1 = 400 - 3(100)\na_1 = 400 - 300\na_1 = 100\nNow that we have the first term (a_1) and the common difference (d), we can find the sixth term (a_6) using the formula:\na_6 = a_1 + (6-1)(d)\nSubstituting",
        "\nTo find the sixth term, we need to first find the common difference (d) of the arithmetic sequence. We can do this by taking the difference between the fourth and eighth terms and dividing it by the number of terms between the fourth and eighth terms. In this case, (500 - 400) / (8 - 4) = 100 / 4 = 25.\nNow that we know the common difference is 25, we can find the sixth term by adding 5 (the current position) to the common difference: 400 + 5 * 25 = 400 + 125 = 525.\nTherefore, the sixth term is 525.\n#### 525\nThe answer is: 525",
