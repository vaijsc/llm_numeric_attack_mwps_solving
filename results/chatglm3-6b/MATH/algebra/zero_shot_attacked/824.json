        " To compute 425^2, we can use the following steps:\n1. Split 425 into its prime factors, which is 5 x 85.\n2. Use the formula (p1^2 + p2^2 + ... + pk^2)^2 = p1^4 + 2p1^2p2^2 + p2^4, where p1 and p2 are the prime factors of the base number.\nUsing this formula, we get:\n(5^2 + 85^2)^2 = 5^4 + 2(5^2)(85^2) + 85^4\nNow, we can calculate the square of each term:\n5^4 = 625\n85^2 = 7225\n2(5^2)(85^2) = 2(25)(7225) = 36125\nNow, we add the results:\n625 + 36125 + 81425 = 425^2\n425^2 = 425,625\nSo, 425 squared is 425,625.",
        " To compute 425^2, we can use the formula for finding the square of a binomial: (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2.\nHere, a = 425/2 = 212.5 and b = 25, so\n425^2 = (212.5 + 25)^2 = 237.5^2.\nNow we can use the formula to find the square of a decimal: (a.b)^2 = a^2 \\* 10^2 = (237.5)^2.\nFirst, we'll find the square of the integer part 237: 237^2 = 54629.\nNext, we find the square of the decimal part 0.5: 0.5^2 = 0.25.\nFinally, we multiply the results: 54629 \\* 0.25 = 13657.25.\nSo, 425^2 = 13657.25.",
        "\nWe can break down 425^2 into (425)(425) and we can use the property of multiplying powers with the same base is the same as multiplying the exponents. So, we can have:\n425^2 = (425)(425)\nAnd we can also use the property that (a^m)^n is equal to a^(m\\*n). So, we can rewrite the equation as:\n425^2 = (425)(425) = (425)^(1\\*2)\nNow we can substitute 425 into the equation:\n425^2 = 425(425) = 425^2\nSo, 425^2 is equal to 425(425) which is equal to 425^2.\nTherefore, 425^2 = 425(425) = 425^2.",
        "\nTo compute 425^2, we can start by calculating the square of the unit digit, which is 5. The unit digit is 5, so the tens digit is the same as the unit digit. \nTo calculate the square of the tens digit, which is 2, we can use the following tactics:\n- First, calculate 2^2 = 4.\n- Then, multiply 4 by the tens digit 2 to get 4 * 2 = 8.\nSo, the tens digit is 8.\nTo calculate the square of the hundreds digit, which is 4, we can use the following tactics:\n- First, calculate 4^2 = 16.\n- Then, multiply 16 by the hundreds digit 4 to get 16 * 4 = 64.\nSo, the hundreds digit is 6.\nNow, we can write down the result as a number with digits from left to right:\n- 648.\nTherefore, 425^2 = 648.\nThe answer is: 648",
        " One way to compute 425^2 in your head is to break down 425 into its prime factors: 425 = 5^2 * 17. Then we can use the rule of exponentiation that says (p^m)^n = p^(m*n) to compute the square: 425^2 = (5^2 * 17)^2 = 5^(2*2) * 17^2 = 25 * 289 = 7225.\u7684\u6c1b\u56f4, \u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba",
        " To compute 425^2, we can use the formula: (a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2. In this case, a = 425 and b = 0. Therefore, we have: \n(425+0)^2 = 425^2 + 2(425)*0 + 0^2\nSimplifying this expression:\n425^2 = 425^2\n2(425)*0 = 0\n0^2 = 0\nTherefore, 425^2 = 425^2. The answer is 425",
        " We can use the identity $(a+b)^2=a^2+2ab+b^2$.\nIn this case, $a=250$ and $b=175$, so the expression becomes $(250+175)^2$.\nWe can then simplify the expression by using the formula for $(a+b)^2$: $(250+175)^2=250^2+2(250)(175)+175^2$.\nEvaluating each term, we get $250^2=62500$, $2(250)(175)=100000$, and $175^2=3125$.\nAdding these together, we get $62500+100000+3125=162625$.\nTherefore, $425^2=162625$.\nThe answer is: 162625",
