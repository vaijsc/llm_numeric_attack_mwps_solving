        "\nTo evaluate $\\log_4$, we need to determine the power to which 4 must be raised to obtain a value.\nLet's consider the equation $4^x = y$.\nSince $4$ is raised to the power of $x$, this equation tells us that $y$ is equal to $4^x$.\nWe want to find the value of $x$ in the equation $\\log_4 y = x$.\nWe know that the logarithmic base is the base that we are trying to find power of. In this case, we are trying to find the power to which $4$ must be raised to obtain $y$.\nSo, the correct way to evaluate $\\log_4$ is to solve for $x$ in the equation $4^x = y$.\nHowever, in your question, you split $\\log_4$ into two parts: $\\log_4$ and $-1$. This is not\u6b63\u786e. $\\log_4$ can only be evaluated as a single quantity, not as two separate parts $x$ and $y$.\nIt's also important to note that $\\log_4$ is the exponent to which 4 must be raised to obtain a value. So, $\\log_4$ is always a positive quantity.\nTherefore, the correct way to evaluate $\\log_4$ is to raise 4 to the power of the result and call it the value of $\\log_4$.\nLet's try to use this approach to solve your question:\nIf $4^{\\log_4 y} = y$, then we can rewrite the equation as $y = 4^{\\log_4 y}$.\nSince $\\log_4 y$ is the exponent to which 4 must be raised to obtain $y$, we can rewrite it as $4^y = y$.\nLet's see if the equation $4^{\\log_4 y} = y$ holds true for certain values of $y$.\nSubstituting $y = 2$, we get $4^{\\log_4 2} = 2$.\nThis is true.\nSubstituting $y = 3$, we get $4^{\\log_4 3} = 3$.\nThis is also true.\nThus, we can conclude that $\\log_4$ is equal to the value that satisfies the equation $4",
        " \nWe can use the property of logarithms that states $\\log_b(a^c) = c \\log_b(a)$.\nIn this case, we have $\\log_4(2^2) = 2 \\log_4(2)$.\nSince $2^2 = 4$, we can further simplify to $\\log_4(4)$.\nThe logarithm base 4 of 4 is 2, so our final answer is $\\boxed{2}$.\nThe answer is: 2",
        " \nTo evaluate $\\log_4$, we need to solve for $x$ in the equation $4^x = y$. Let's use the property of logarithms that states $\\log_b a^x = x \\log_b a$. Applying this property to our equation, we have $x \\log_4 4 = y$. We can simplify this to $x = \\frac{y}{2}$. \nNow, let's solve for $x$. Again, using the property of logarithms, we can say that $\\log_b a = \\frac{1}{\\log_a b}$. Therefore, $\\log_4 2 = \\frac{1}{\\log_{2} 4}$. Using the property $\\log_a b^c = c \\log_a b$, we can rewrite this as $\\frac{1}{\\log_{2} 4} = \\frac{1}{2 \\log_{2} 2}$. Carrying out the multiplication, we find that $\\log_{2} 2 = 1$, so $\\log_{2} 4 = 2$, and $\\frac{1}{2 \\log_{2} 2} = \\frac{1}{2(1)} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nTherefore, $\\log_4 = \\frac{1}{2}$.",

        "\nRecall the definition of logarithms: it is the inverse operation of exponentiation.\nWe could use the property $\\log_b a = n$ is equivalent to $a = b^n$ to find this value.  In this case,\n$$4^n = 2^{2n} = 2^2 \\cdot 2^n = 4 \\cdot 2^n$$and$$2^n = 2 \\cdot 2^{(n-1)} = 2 \\cdot 2^{(n-1)} \\cdot 2^{(n-1)} = 2^{2n-2} \\cdot 2^{(n-1)}.$$Therefore, $4^n = 2^{2n} = 2^{2 \\cdot (n-1+1)} = 2^{2(n-1)+2} = 2^{2(n-1)+2} = 2^{2n}  $.\nThus, $n=1$.
