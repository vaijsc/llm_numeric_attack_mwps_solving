Dividing both sides by $5$, we get $y = 3z$.\nSubstituting $y$ from the second equation into the first equation, we get $x = 12z$.\nTherefore, $\\frac{x}{z} = \\frac{12z}{z} = \\boxed{12}$.",

        " \nWe are given that 4x=8y and 5y=15z. To find the value of $\\frac{x}{z}$, we need to find the values of x and z first. notice that we can express 8y in terms of 5y. Since 15z/5y=3, we rewrite the first equation as $\\frac{4}{1}x = 2\\cdot 2\\cdot 3y = 4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2y = 24y$. The second equation can be modified as $\\frac{5}{1}y = 15z$, so we can rewrite it as $y = \\frac{15}{5}z$. The way to express x in terms of z is to repeat the factorization of $4$ in the first equation: $4x = 4\\cdot x$. Since we rearranged the second equation, a nice value of 3 could crowd out the z term, we'll see that $x - 3z = x$\nThis last equation shows that x and z are 3z apart and thus x=3z, thus our final answer is $\\frac{x}{z} = \\frac{3z}{z} = \\\u505a covered.0 \\boxed{3}$.",
