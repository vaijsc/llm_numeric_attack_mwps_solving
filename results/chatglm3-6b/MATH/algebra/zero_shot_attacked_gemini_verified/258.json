        " To find the product of the two numbers, we first need to find the two numbers themselves.\nThe sum of two numbers is given as 80, so let's call the two numbers x and y.\nWe can write the equation sum(x, y) = 80 as:\nx + y = 80\nThe difference of two numbers is given as 12, so let's call the two numbers x and y again.\nWe can write the equation difference(x, y) = 12 as:\nx - y = 12\nNow we have two equations:\nx + y = 80\nx - y = 12\nWe can solve this system of equations by adding the two equations together:\n(x + y) + (x - y) = 80 + 12\n2x = 92\nDividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get:\nx = 46\nNow we can substitute the value of x back into one of the original equations to find y:\nx + y = 80\n46 + y = 80\nSubtracting 46 from both sides of the equation, we get:\ny = 34\nSo, x = 46 and y = 34.\nNow we can find their product by multiplying x and y together:\nx * y = 46 * 34 = 1504\n#### 1504\nThe answer is: 1504",
