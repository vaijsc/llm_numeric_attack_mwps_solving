        " Simplifying the expression:\nFirst, let's simplify the fraction. The fraction $16/725$ can be simplified by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is $8$.\n$16/725 = (16/8) / (725/8) = 2/90$\nSo, the expression $\\left( \\frac{16}{725} \\right)^{\\frac14}$ can now be written as $\\left( \\frac{2}{90} \\right)^{\\frac14}$.\nNow, let's simplify the exponent. \n$\\left( \\frac{2}{90} \\right)^{\\frac14} = \\left( \\frac{2}{90} \\right)^{\\frac{4}{16}} = \\left( \\frac{2}{90} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{4}}$.\nFinally, let's write this as a fraction.\n$\\left( \\frac{2}{90} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{4}} = \\frac{1}{(90^{\\frac{4}{16}})}$.\nNow we need to calculate the exponent variance $\\frac{4}{16}$ first.\n$90^{\\frac{4}{16}} = \\sqrt[16]{90^4}$\n$= \\sqrt[16]{8100}$\n$= \\sqrt[16]{2^5 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^2}$.\nSo $90^{\\frac{4}{16}}$ is equal to $\\sqrt[16]{2^5 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^2}$.\nNow we can find the fraction.\n$\\frac{1}{(90^{\\frac{4}{16}})} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[16]{2^5 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^2}}$.\nSo, the expression $\\left( \\frac{16}{725} \\right)^{\\frac14}$ is equal to $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[16]{2^5 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^2}}$.\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[16]{2^5 \\"
