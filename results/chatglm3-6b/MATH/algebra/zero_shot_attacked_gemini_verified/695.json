        " We know that $f(-3)=4$, so we substitute $x=-3$ into the expression for $f(x)$ to get $-3^4-(-3)^2+(-3)+5=4$. Simplifying the left side gives $-81+9-3+5=4$.

Practice makes perfect, so we will try again. ### Solution: We try to come up with a different approach. Since $f(x) = ax^4 - bx^2 + x + 5$, we can see that $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 4. Therefore, we know that $f(x)$ has a term of degree 4 in $x^4$, a term of degree 2 in $x^2$, a term of degree 1 in $x$, and a constant term. Since we are given that $f(-3) = 4$, we can use this information to help us determine the coefficients of the polynomial. In particular, we know that $f(-3)=a(-3)^4-b((-3)^2)+(-3)+5=4$. Simplifying the left side gives $-81a-9b-3+5=4$. Combining like terms gives $-81a-9b-3+2=-4$. Since the last two terms both equal 2, we can set these equal to each other and solve for $a$ in terms of $b$:  \\begin{align*}\n-81a-9b-3&=2\\\\\n-81a-9b&=-5\n\\end{align*}Now we know that $a$ and $b$ satisfy $f(-3)=4$, or$-81a-9b=-5$.  Multiplying the equation $-81a-9b=-5$ by 9 gives$-729a-81b=-45$. Adding $81a-9b=-5$ to this new equation gives $-729a-9b=-45-5=-49$. Therefore, we have \\begin{align*}\n-729a-9b&=-49\\\\"
