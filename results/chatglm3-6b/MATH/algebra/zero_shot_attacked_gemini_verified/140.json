        " To find the sum of the sixth and seventh terms, we need to find the terms first. \nLet's represent the nth term of the sequence as T(n). We know the first term is 2422, so T(1) = 2422. \nEach succeeding term is found by adding 1010, so T(n) = T(n-1) + 1010.\nTo find the sum of the sixth term, we need to find T(5) by adding 1010 to the fifth term, which we can represent as T(5) = T(4) + 1010. \nContinuing this pattern, we can find T(6) = T(5) + 1010 = (T(4) + 1010) + 1010 = T(4) + 2020. \nTo find the sum of the sixth and seventh terms, we add T(6) and T(7), which can be represented as T(6) + T(7) = (T(4) + 2020) + (T(6) - T(4)). \nSince we have already found T(6), we can simplify this to T(6) + T(7) = T(6) + 1010 - T(4). \nNow, we know that T(4) = T(3) + 1010 = T(2) + 1010 + 1010 = T(1) + 1010 + 1010 + 1010 = 2422 + 1010 + 1010 + 1010 = 2422 + 4030. \nSubstituting this back into our equation, we have T(6) + T(7) = T(6) + 1010 - (2422 + 4030). \nSimplifying, we have 1010 + (2422 + 4030) = T(6) + 1010 + 2422 + 4030. \nSimplifying further, we have 7",
