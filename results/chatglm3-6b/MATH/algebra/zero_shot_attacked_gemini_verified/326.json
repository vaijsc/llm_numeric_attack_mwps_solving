        " We are given two equations: $525^b = 5$ and $27^b = c$.\nFirst, let's simplify $525$ by factoring it into its prime factors: $525 = 5 \\cdot 105 = 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 15 = 5 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7$.\nSince we have $5$ in the factors, let's try pricing this out with the base of $5$ and exponent of $3$ to see if it matches the other base and exponent: $5^3 = 125$.\nThis means the equation $525^b = 5$ can be rewritten as $125^b = 5$.\nNow we need to find the value of $c$, which is given by $27^b = c$.\nSince $27 = 3^3$, let's rewrite this equation in terms of powers of $3$: $3^{3b} = c$.\nSince we know $5^3 = 125$ and $125 = 5^3$, we can substitute the value of $125$ into the equation to get $3^{3b} = 3^{b+b+b} = 3^{2b+1}$.\nTo make the numbers equal, we must have $3^{2b+1} = 125$.\nSince $125 = 5^3$, we can rewrite this as $3^{2b+1} = 5^{3}$.\nSince the bases are equal, we can set the exponents equal to each other: $2b+1 = 3$.\nSolving for $b$, we find $b=1$.\nNow we substitute the value of $b$ into the equation $27^b = c$ to find $c$: $27^1 = 27 = c$.\nThe value of $c$ is $\\boxed{27}$.\n#### 27\nThe answer is: 27",
