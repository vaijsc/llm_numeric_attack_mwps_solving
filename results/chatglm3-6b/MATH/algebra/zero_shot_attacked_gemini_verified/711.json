        "Let's denote Andrew's current age as \\( A \\) and his grandfather's current age as \\( G \\).\nAccording to the problem:\n1. \\( G = 8A \\) (Andrew's grandfather's age is eight times Andrew's age).\n2. When Andrew was born, his grandfather was 86 years old.\nIf Andrew is currently \\( A \\) years old, then he was born \\( A \\) years ago. Therefore, his grandfather's current age can also be expressed as:\n\\[\nG = 86 + A\n\\]\nNow we have two equations:\n1. \\( G = 8A \\)\n2. \\( G = 86 + A \\)\nWe can set these two expressions for \\( G \\) equal to each other:\n\\[\n8A = 86 + A\n\\]\nNow, we will solve for \\( A \\):\n1. Subtract \\( A \\) from both sides:\n\\[\n8A - A = 86\n\\]\n\\[\n7A = 86\n\\]\n2. Now, divide both sides by 7:\n\\[\nA = \\frac{86}{7}\n\\]\nCalculating this, we get:\n\\[\nA = 12.28571428571429\n\\]\nSince the instruction states to convert to float:\n\\[\nA \\approx 12.29\n\\]\nNow, substituting back to find grandfather's age:\n\\[\nG = 8A = 8 \\times 12.28571428571429 \\approx 98.28571428571429\n\\]\nHowever, age must be an integer, and since we've derived \\( A \\) as a fraction, it suggests that there's no valid solution in integers while keeping grandfather's age as exactly 8 times Andrew's age.\nTherefore, we conclude:\nnot exist\nFinal answer: not exist",
        "Let \\( A \\) be Andrew's current age, and \\( G \\) be Andrew's grandfather's current age.\nFrom the problem, we have the following two pieces of information:\n1. Andrew's grandfather's age is eight times Andrew's age:\n   \\[\n   G = 8A\n   \\]\n   \n2. Andrew's grandfather was 86 years old when Andrew was born. This means that the age difference between Andrew's grandfather and Andrew is 86 years:\n   \\[\n   G = A + 86\n   \\]\nNow, we can set the two equations we have for \\( G \\) equal to each other:\n\\[\n8A = A + 86\n\\]\nNext, we'll solve for \\( A \\):\nSubtract \\( A \\) from both sides:\n\\[\n8A - A = 86\n\\]\n\\[\n7A = 86\n\\]\nNow, divide both sides by 7:\n\\[\nA = \\frac{86}{7}\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\nA = 12.285714285714286\n\\]\nTo provide the final result in float:\n\\[\nA \\approx 12.29\n\\]\nNow to find Andrew's grandfather's age using \\( G = 8A \\):\n\\[\nG = 8 \\times \\frac{86}{7} = \\frac{688}{7} \\approx 98.28571428571429\n\\]\nBoth ages can be verified to make sure they are consistent:\n- If Andrew is approximately 12.29 years old, then his grandfather is pegged at 8 times that, which approximates to 98.29.\n- The age difference should be consistent with the condition that grandfather was 86 when Andrew was born:\n   - \\( G - A = 86 \\)\n   - \\( \\frac{688}{7} - \\frac{86}{7} = \\frac{688 - 86}{7} = \\frac{602}{7} = 86 \\) \nSince everything checks out, the final answer for Andrew's age is approximately:\n**Final result: 12.285714285714286**",

This means the difference in their ages is \\( 86 \\) years.\nNow, we can set up the equation based on their ages:\n\\[\n8a - a = 86\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n7a = 86\n\\]\nTo find Andrew's age, we divide both sides by \\( 7 \\):\n\\[\na = \\frac{86}{7}\n\\]\nCalculating this gives:\n\\[\na = 12.285714285714286\n\\]\nThus, Andrew's current age is approximately \\( 12.29 \\) (as a float). \nFinal result: 12.285714285714286"

        "\nLet\u2019s assume Andrew's age is $a$. Therefore, his grandfather's age is $8a$.\nGiven that Andrew's grandfather was 86 years old when Andrew was born, we can set up the following equation: $8a = 86$\nTo find Andrew's current age, we need to solve for $a$ and add the number of years that have passed since Andrew was born. \nFrom the equation $8a = 86$, we can divide both sides of the equation by 8 to isolate $a$:\n$\\frac{8a}{8} = \\frac{86}{8}$\n$a = 10.75$\nSince age is a whole number, we can round down to the nearest whole number.\nTherefore, Andrew is currently $\\boxed{10}$ years old.\nThe answer is: 10",

Let B be the number of years ago that Andrew was born.\nlevel 2: A - B = grandfather's age - 86 = 8A - 86\nSince we're given that the grandfather's age at the time Andrew was born is 86, we can substitute that value into the equation to get:\nA - B = 86\nNow we have two equations:\nlevel 1: 8A = grandfather's age => grandfather's age = 8A\nlevel 2: A - B = 86 => grandfather's age - 86 = 8A - 86\nWe can solve these equations simultaneously by substitution. From level 1, we can express the grandfather's age in terms of Andrew's age:\ngrandfather's age = 8A\nSubstitute this expression for grandfather's age into level 2:\n8A - 86 = 8A\nSimplify the equation:\n-86 = 0\nThis equation is not possible since -86 cannot equal 0.
