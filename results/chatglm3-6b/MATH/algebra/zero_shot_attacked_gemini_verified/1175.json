        "\nFirst, we can simplify the given equation: $-a - 3b = -23$. \nTo isolate $a$, we can add $3b$ to both sides of the equation:  $-a - 3b + 3b = -23 + 3b$.  This gives $-a = -23 + 3b$.  \nNext, to isolate $-a$, we can multiply both sides of the equation by $-1$:  $a = -(-23 + 3b) = 23 - 3b$.  \nSince $a$ and $b$ are consecutive integers, the only possible value for $a$ would be $23 - 3b$.  To find the possible values for $a$, we can test different values of $b$.  \nFor instance, if we let $b = 1$, then $a = 23 - 3(1) = 20$.  However, if we let $b = 2$, then $a = 23 - 3(2) = 15$.  Since $a$ and $b$ are consecutive integers, $a$ cannot be equal to $15$ because $1$ is not a consecutive integer to $5$.  \nTherefore, the possible values for $a$ are $20$ and $15$.
