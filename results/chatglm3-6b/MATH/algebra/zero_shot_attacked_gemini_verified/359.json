        " The sum of all integers $x$ for which $-30 \\leq x \\leq 36$ can be found by adding the numbers from $-30$ to $0$ and from $0$ to $36$. \nThe numbers from $-30$ to $0$ form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of $1$. \nThe sum of an arithmetic sequence can be found by taking the average of the first and last term, then multiplying by the number of terms. The number of terms in an arithmetic sequence can be found by taking the difference between the first and last term, dividing by the common difference, and adding $1$.\nIn this case, the first term is $-30$, the last term is $0$, and the common difference is $1$. So, the number of terms in the sequence is $\\frac{0-(-30)}{1}+1 = 31$.\nThe sum of this sequence is $\\frac{-30+0}{2}\\cdot31 = -15\\cdot31 = -495$.\nThe numbers from $0$ to $36$ form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of $1$.\nThe number of terms in this sequence is $36-0+1 = 37$.\nThe sum of this sequence is $\\frac{0+36}{2}\\cdot37 = 18\\cdot37 = 666$.\nFinally, the total sum of all integers $x$ for which $-30 \\leq x \\leq 36$ is $-495 + 666 = \\boxed{171}$.",

        " We can start by finding the sum of an arithmetic series. The formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is: \\[S = \\frac{n}{2}(a + l),\\] where $a$ is the first term, $l$ is the last term, and $n$ is the number of terms. In this case, $a = -30$, $l = 36$, and $n$ is the number of integers between $-30$ and $36$. We need to find $n$.\nThe integers between $-30$ and $36$ are given by: $-29, -28, \\ldots, 1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 35, 36$. Notice that each integer is $1$ greater than the previous integer. Therefore, we can write the sequence as an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of $1$.\nTo find $n$, we can use the formula for the $n$th term of an arithmetic sequence: \\[l = a + (n - 1)d.\\] Since $l = 36$, we have $36 = -30 + (n - 1)1$. Simplifying, we get $n - 1 = 6$ or $n = 7$.\nNow we can find the sum $S$. Substituting $a = -30$, $l = 36$, and $n = 7$ into the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, we get \\[S = \\frac{7}{2}( (-30) + 36) = \\frac{7}{2}( 36) = \\frac{22}{2} \\cdot 36 = \\boxed{388}.\\]",
