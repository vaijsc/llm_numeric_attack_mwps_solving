        "\nFirst, we need to calculate the total cost for making the widgets. Since each widget costs $0.50 to make, and the company makes $n$ widgets, the total cost for making the widgets is $0.50n$.\nNext, we need to calculate the total revenue for selling the widgets. Since each widget sells for $2.75, and the company makes $n$ widgets, the total revenue from selling the widgets is $2.75n$.\nTo determine if the company makes a profit, we need to compare total revenue to the total cost. If the total revenue is greater than the total cost, then the company makes a profit.\nTherefore, we have the inequality $2.75n > 0.50n + 1400$. We can subtract $0.50n$ from both sides to get $2.25n > 1400$.\nDividing both sides of the inequality by $2.25$, we get $n > \\frac{1400}{2.25}$.\nSince the number of widgets must be a whole number, we round up to the nearest whole number.\nThus, the company must sell at least $\\left\\lceil \\frac{1400}{2.25} \\right\\rceil = \\boxed{660}$ widgets to make a profit.The answer is: 660",
