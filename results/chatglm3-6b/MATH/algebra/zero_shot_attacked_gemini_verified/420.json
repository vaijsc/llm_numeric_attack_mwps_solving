To find the y-intercept of a function, we need to evaluate the function when $x = 0$. In this case, we substitute $x = 0$ into the expression for $P(x)$ and find that $P(0) = -1$. Since $Q(x)$ is the square of $P(x)$, we can conclude that $Q(0) = P(0)^2 = (-1)^2 = 1$. Therefore, the y-intercept of $Q(x)$ is $\\boxed{1}$.\nThe answer is: 1",
        " The y-intercept of $Q(x)$ is the value of $Q(x)$ when $x = 0$.\nWe can see this by substituting $0$ into $Q(x)$ since $P(0) = P(x)^2 = 0^2 = 0$.\nTherefore, the value of $Q(x)$ when $x = 0$ is $Q(0) = P(0)^2 = 0^2 = \\boxed{0}$.\nThe answer is: 0",
        " To find the $y$-intercept of $Q(x)$, we need to find the value of $x$ when $Q(x) = 0$.

In other words, we need to find the value of $x$ when $Q(x) = 0$.\nFirst, let's find the expression for $Q(x)$. We know that $Q(x) = P(x)^2$, so we can substitute $P(x)$ into the expression for $Q(x)$:\n$Q(x) = (4x^3 - 10x^2 + 7x - 1)^2$\nNow, let's expand this expression. We can use the binomial theorem to expand $(4x^3 - 10x^2 + 7x - 1)^2$:\n$Q(x) = (4x^3 - 10x^2 + 7x - 1)(4x^3 - 10x^2 + 7x - 1)$\n$Q(x) = 16x^6 - 40x^5 + 49x^4 - 20x^3 + 35x^2 - 8x + 1$\nNow, let's set $Q(x)$ equal to $0$ and solve for $x$:\n$0 = 16x^6 - 40x^5 + 49x^4 - 20x^3 + 35x^2 - 8x + 1$\nWe must have $Q(x) = 16x^6 - 40x^5 + 49x^4 - 20x^3 + 35x^2 - 8x + 1 = 0$. Let's factorize this polynomial.\nTo find the factors of $Q(x)$, we first find the roots of $Q(x)$. We can use the Rational Root Theorem to find any possible rational roots.\n$Q(x)$ has a highest power of $x$ of $6$, so any possible rational roots must be of the form $x = \\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ is a divisor of the constant term $1$ and $",
