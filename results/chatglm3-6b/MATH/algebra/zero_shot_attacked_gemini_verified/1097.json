We try to find two numbers whose product is -1200 and whose sum is 5.

To find the critical points, we have 4L + 120 = 0 or L - 40 = 0, which gives us L = -120/4 or L = 40. Since the length cannot be negative, the only possible valid length is L = 40. \nSubstituting this value back into the expression for width, we have width = 40 + 5 = <<40+5=45>>45. \nTherefore, the width of the plot is 45 ft.",
