        " To find the maximum area of the rectangular garden, we need to consider both the length and width of the garden. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2L + 2W, where P is the perimeter, L is the length, and W is the width. In this case, we know that the perimeter is 300 feet.\nSo, we can substitute the given perimeter into the formula:\n300 = 2L + 2W\nDividing both sides by 2:\n150 = L + W\nNow, we need to find the maximum area by maximizing the product of the length and width. Let's assume the length of the garden (L) is fixed. In that case, the width (W) can be expressed as W = 150 - L. Substituting this expression for W into the area formula A:\nA = L * W\nA = L * (150 - L)\nA = 150L - L^2\nTo find the maximum area, we can take the derivative of A with respect to L and set it equal to zero:\ndA/dL = 150 - 2L\nSetting dA/dL = 0:\n150 - 2L = 0\n2L = 150\nL = 75\nSo, the length of the garden is 75 feet. Substituting this value back into the expression for W:\nW = 150 - L\nW = 150 - 75\nW = 75\nTherefore, the maximum area of the garden is:\nA = L * W\nA = 75 * 75\nA = 5625 square feet\nSo, the maximum area of the garden is 5625 square feet.",
        " Let the length of the garden be $l$ and the width be $w$. We know that the perimeter of the garden is 300, so $2l+2w=300$. Solving for $l$, we have $l=150-\\frac{w}{2}$. We want to maximize the area, which is given by $A=lw$. Statement 1 is false. \nTo finish up, the maximum area of the garden will be possible given by the statement that the length is 75 and the width is 75, or when $w=l=0$ and $w=-2$. However, it is important to note that the question specify the garden must be rectangular. Since the width can't be a negative number, the maximum area able to be achieved is $0$.",
        " To find the maximum area of the rectangular garden, we need to determine the dimensions of the rectangle that would use 300 feet of fencing. We can start by dividing the total perimeter of the rectangle by 2, which is equal to the length and width addendums. \nLet's represent the length of the rectangle as L and the width as W. The perimeter equation for a rectangle is P = 2L + 2W. Given that the total perimeter is 300 feet (P = 300) and we are trying to maximize the area (A = L * W), we can set up the following equation: \n2L + 2W = 300 \nFrom this equation, we can derive the value of W in terms of L: \n2W = 300 - 2L\nW = (300/2) - L \n150/2 - L = 0.5L\n150 = L + 0.5L\nL = 150/1.5\nL = 100\nNow that we have the value of W as 150/2 - L, let's substitute the value of L into this equation to find the maximum area: \nW = 150/2 - 100 \nW = 75 - 100 \nW = -25\nHowever, the width cannot be negative. This indicates that there is no real solution for the dimensions of the rectangle that would use 300 feet of fencing. Therefore, the maximum area of this garden is not achievable.",
        " To find the maximum area of the garden, we need to find the dimensions of the garden that use the least amount of fencing while still entirely enclosing the garden. In other words, we want to find the dimensions $l$ and $w$ such that $2l + 2w = 300$. Since $l$ and $w$ must be positive integers, we can start by finding the factors of 300. \nThe prime factorization of 300 is $2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^2$. Therefore, we can have the following pairs of dimensions that use the least amount of fencing while still providing a garden:\n- $l = 2, w = 150$\n- $l = 4, w = 75$\nNow let's calculate the maximum area using each pair of dimensions.\nFor the pair $l = 2, w = 150$, the area is $2 \\times 2 \\times 150 = 600$ square feet.\nFor the pair $l = 4, w = 75$, the area is $4 \\times 4 \\times 75 = 1050$ square feet.\nTherefore, the maximum area of the garden is $\\boxed{600}$ square feet.",
        " To find the maximum area of the rectangular garden, we need to determine the length and width of the garden using the given information about the fencing. Let's assume that the length of the garden is L feet and the width is W feet. In this case, we know that the perimeter of the garden is equal to the total length of the fencing used.\nAccording to the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, the perimeter is given by 2L + 2W. Since the perimeter is given as 300 feet, we can set up the equation:\n2L + 2W = 300\nSimplifying the equation, we have:\nL + W = 150\nSince we want to find the maximum area of the garden, we know that the product of the length and the width (A) is maximized when both the length (L) and width (W) are as close as possible. \nTo find the values of L and W that give us the maximum area, we can try different pairs of positive integers that sum up to 150, and calculate their area.\nLet's calculate the area for each pair of positive integers that sum up to 150:\n1 + 149 = 149\n2 + 148 = 150\n3 + 147 = 150\n4 + 146 = 150\n...\nAfter trying different pairs, we find that the maximum area of the garden is 150 * 1 = 150.\nTherefore, the maximum area of the rectangular garden, given 300 feet of fencing, is 150 square feet.",
        " Let the length of the rectangular garden be $ l $ and the width be $ w $. Since the fencing must entirely enclose the garden, the perimeter of the garden is $ 2l + 2w = 300 $. Solving for $ l, $ we get $ l = 300 - w. $ The maximum area of the garden occurs when the width is maximized, since the area is given by length times width. Substituting $ l = 300 - w $ into the area equation, we get $ A = w(300 - w) = - w^2 + 300w. $ Completing the square, we find that this quadratic is maximized at $ w = \\frac{-b}{2a} = \\frac{-300}{2(-1)}=\\frac{300}{2}=\\boxed{150}$.

        " To find the maximum area of the garden, we need to determine the length and width. Let's assume the length of the garden is L and the width is W. According to the given information, the garden is enclosed by fencing that entirely surrounds it. So, the perimeter of the garden is given by the sum of all four sides, which is 2L + 2W = 300. 1. \nTo solve for the maximum area, we need to use the fact that the garden is a rectangle, which means the area A = L * W. To find the maximum area, we can use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, P = 2L + 2W, where P is the perimeter and L is the length. Rearranging this formula, we can express L in terms of W:  2L = P - 2W  L = (P - 2W)/2   Now we can substitute this expression for L into the area formula to find A as a function of W:  A = ((P - 2W)/2) * W  A = (P - 2W)/2  2.\nThere, we find that the area is not directly affected by the given perimeter. Consequently, since we don't have the reverse operation (how can we find W from a given area and perimeter), we can't attempt to set up an equation for the area in terms of only one variable. \nTo find the maximum area of the garden, you should conduct some calculus or explicit algebraic manipulations to find critical points of the area function A = (P - 2W)/2 with respect to W (the width). 2.  \nTo find the width that maximizes the area, we should calculate the value of A at the critical point(s) found in the previous step using differentiating the above area function which will give us the rate of change at that point and then equate it to zero to find the critical point and determine if it's a maximum. 3.  \nFinally, check the\u7aef\u70b9 values (as the width approaches 0 and\u65e0\u7a77\u5927), as well as the inflection points, to ensure that the critical point is indeed a maximum, and not a minimum or an inflection point.",
        " To find the maximum area of the garden, we need to find the dimensions of the garden that require the minimum amount of fencing.\nFirst, let's call the length of the garden \"x\" and the width \"y\". Both \"x\" and \"y\" will be positive numbers because the length and width of the garden need to be positive.\nThe perimeter of the garden is given by the formula: P = 2x + 2y\nWe know that the perimeter of the garden is 300 feet. So,\n300 = 2x + 2y\nTo solve for \"x\", we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:\n300/2 = x + y\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\nx + y = 150\nNow, let's find the area of the garden using the formula: A = xy\nTo find the maximum area, we need to find the area that corresponds to the minimum number of sides around the garden. In this case, it would be all sides (4 sides).\nSo, we have:\nA = xy\nSince the perimeter is equated to 300, the minimum number of sides needed to enclose the garden is enabling all 4 sides. Using this, we can express x in terms of the remaining side (y):\nA = xy = y(300/4)\nA = 75y\nTo make it easier to find the maximum area, let's find the derivative of A with respect to y.\ndA/dy = 75\nSetting dA/dy = 0 and solving for y:\n75 = 0\nThis equation is not possible. So, there is no y-values that would result in the maximum area of the garden.\nTherefore, we cannot find a specific maximum area for this garden and\u54a8\u8be2 the AITOI.",
        " To maximize the area of the garden, it\u2019s important to determine the dimensions that will use the least amount of fencing to enclose the space.\nIn this case, we have limited space, so we have to work with the fencing.\nWe know that the perimeter is $2l+2w=300$, where $l$ represents the length of the garden and $w$ represents the width.\nSolving for $w$, we have $w=150-l$.\nPlugging this into the area formula $A=lw$, we have $A=l[150-l]$.\nThis is the maximum area of the garden in terms of $l$, and we can find the value of $l$ that maximizes this area.\nSince we are working with an inequality, we can express the solution as $2\\leq l\\leq 150$.\nThe maximum value of $l$ that satisfies this inequality is 149, which yields an area of $149 \\times 150 - 149 \\times 149 = 21900$.\nTherefore, the maximum area of the garden is $\\boxed{21900}$.",
        " To find the maximum area of the garden, we can use optimization techniques. Let's denote the length of the garden as l and the width as w. We know that the perimeter is 300 feet, so we can write the equation: 2l + 2w = 300. We also know that area is given by multiplying the length and the width, so we can write the equation for area as A = l * w.\nSince the garden is rectangular, the length and width are related. We can substitute w = 150 - l into the area equation to eliminate the variable l. The new equation becomes A = l * (150 - l).\nTo find the maximum area, we need to find the vertex of the parabola. The x-coordinate of the vertex is given by less than or equal to the equation's maximum. We can find the x-coordinate of the vertex by taking the derivative of the equation, then setting it equal to zero:\ndA/dl = 150 - 2l = 0\nSimplifying the equation, we find that l = 75.\nSubstituting l = 75 into the equation for the maximum area, we find that A = 75 * (150 - 75) = 6750.\nTherefore, the maximum area of the garden is 6750 square feet.",

According to the problem, the perimeter of the rectangle is 300 feet. \nThe perimeter of a rectangle is given by the sum of all its sides: 2x + 2y. \nUsing this formula, we can set up the following equation: \n2x + 2y = 300 \nNow let's solve this equation step by step.\nFirst, divide both sides of the equation by 2 to obtain: \nx + y = 150 \nThis equation represents the perimeter of the rectangular garden.\nA rectangle has two possible dimensions that will result in a perimeter of 150 feet, given that the width and length are distinct and positive integers. \nBy examining the possible dimensions of a rectangle whose perimeter is 150 feet, we can conclude that there are only two possible dimensions: 30 feet by 50 feet or 50 feet by 30 feet.\nNow, let's calculate the area for both combinations of dimensions:\nFor the first combination, 30 feet by 50 feet, the area is: \n(30 feet)(50 feet) = 1500 square feet\nFor the second combination, 50 feet by 30 feet, the area is: \n(50 feet)(30 feet) = 1500 square feet\n:\u300aArea is 1500 square feet.\u300b",
        " To find the maximum area of the garden, we need to first determine the dimensions of the garden. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width. In this case, the perimeter is given as 300 feet, so we have 2(l + w) = 300. \nTo solve for the length, we can rearrange the equation to isolate l: \nl = (300 - w)/2\nNow that we have an expression for the length in terms of the width, we can use a graphing method to find the point where the area is maximized. \nThe area of the garden is given by the formula A = l(w). Substituting the expression for l, we get: \nA = ((300 - w)/2)(w) = 150w - w^2/2\nTo find the maximum area, we can take the derivative of this expression with respect to w and set it equal to zero: \ndA/dw = 150 - w = 0\nSolving for w, we get w = 150. \nNow that we have found the width at the maximum point, we can substitute this value back into the expression for length to find the length: \nl = (300 - w)/2 = 150. \nFinally, we can calculate the maximum area using the formula A = lw: \nA = 150 * 150 = 22500 square feet. \nTherefore, the maximum area of the garden is 22500 square feet."
