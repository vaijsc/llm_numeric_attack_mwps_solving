        " \nThe given arithmetic sequence has a common difference of 4. To find the nth term, we can use the formula: nth term = first term + (n - 1) * common difference.\nThe 100th term is where n = 100. \nFirst term = 7, \ncommon difference = 4. \nSo, the 100th term is 7 + (100 - 1) * 4 = 7 + 99 * 4 = 7 + 396 = 397.\nTherefore, the 100th term of the arithmetic sequence 7, 11, 15, 19, ... is 397.\nLet's verify this using summation notation.\nThe sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula: S_n = (n / 2)(first term + last term), where the first term is the term 1 is the first term, and the last term is the n-th term.\nHere, the first term is 7, the last term is 397, and n = 100.\nSo, using the formula: S_100 = (100 / 2)(7 + 397) = 50(404) = 20200.\nThis means that the sum of the first 100 terms is 20200.\nTo find the 100th term specifically, we need to divide 20200 by 100 to get the value of the 100th term.\n20200 / 100 = 202.\nTherefore, the 100th term is 202.\nSince 202 is not equal to 397, our answer from step 6 was incorrect.",
