If m = 1, then n = 7. If m = 11, then n = 1.\nTherefore, the two pairs of numbers that satisfy the given conditions are:\n(1, 7) and (11, 1)\nNow, we need to calculate the absolute difference between these pairs:\n|m - n| = |1 - 7| = 6\nor\n|m - n| = |11 - 1| = 10\nSo, there are two possible values for |m - n|, which are 6 and 10.",
        " \nSince we are given two equations, we can solve them to find the values of m and n.\nFrom the first equation, we know that mn = 11.\nTo find the possible values of m and n, we can list all the pairs of numbers whose product is 11.\nThe pairs are: (1,11), (11,1), (3,33), and (33,3).\nFrom the second equation, we know that m+n = 8.\nWe can now solve the system of equations to find the values of m and n.\nFor the pair (1,11), we have m = 1 and n = 11, which satisfies both equations.\nFor the pair (11,1), we have m = 11 and n = 1, which also satisfies both equations.\nFor the pair (3,33), we have m = 3 and n = 33, which satisfies both equations.\nFor the pair (33,3), we have m = 33 and n = 3, which satisfies both equations.\nNow we can find |m-n| for each pair.\nFor (1,11), |m-n| = |1-11| = 10.\nFor (11,1), |m-n| = |11-1| = 10.\nFor (3,33), |m-n| = |3-33| = 30.\nFor (33,3), |m-n| = |33-3| = 30.\nSo, the possible values of |m-n| are 10 and 30.\n#### 10\nThe answer is: 10"
