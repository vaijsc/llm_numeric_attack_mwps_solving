        " \nTo find the sum of $1 + 2 + 3 + \\cdots + 399 + 400$, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.\nThe formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is $S = \\frac{n}{2}(a + l)$, where $S$ is the sum, $n$ is the number of terms, $a$ is the first term, and $l$ is the last term.\nIn this case, the first term $a$ is 1, the last term $l$ is 400, and the number of terms $n$ is 400.\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n$$S = \\frac{400}{2}(1 + 400)$$\nSimplifying:\n$$S = 200(401)$$\n calculus",
        " We can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to find the sum.\nThe formula states that the sum of an arithmetic series S is given by S = (n/2)(a1 + an), where n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term.\nIn this case, we have (n/2)(1 + 400) = (1 + 400) = 401.\nSo the sum is 401.\nHere is the reasoning step by step with the added detail:\nStep 1: Identify the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. \nThe formula is S = (n/2)(a1 + an), where S is the sum of the series, n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term.\nStep 2: Identify the values of n, a1, and an in this case. \nn = 400 (the number of terms)\na1 = 1 (the first term)\nan = 400 (the last term)\nStep 3: Substitute these values into the formula to find the sum. \nS = (400/2)(1 + 400) = (200)(401) = 80800.\nTherefore, 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 399 + 400 = 80800.\nThe answer is: 80800",

        " The sum is equal to the sum of an arithmetic series. The first term is 1 and the last term is 400. We know that the arithmetic series has a common difference of 1. Since the number of terms is 400, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: \\[S = \\frac{n}{2}(a + l),\\] where $S$ is the sum, $n$ is the number of terms, $a$ is the first term, and $l$ is the last term. \\[400 = \\frac{400}{2}(1 + 400).\\] Calculating this, we find \\[400 = 200(401),\\] which is not true.
