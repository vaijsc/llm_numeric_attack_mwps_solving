Therefore, the first square root term has an interval of $x \\in (-\\infty, 5)\\cup (5, \\infty)$.\nThe second square root term, $\\sqrt{-(x-3)}$, is defined when the expression inside the square root is nonnegative. In this case, $-(x-3) \\ge 0$, which gives us $x \\le 3$. So, the second square root term has an interval of $x \\in (-\\infty, 3]$.\nTo find the union of these two intervals, we put them together:\nInterval 1 (from the above analysis): $x \\in (-\\infty, 5)\\cup (5, \\infty)$\nInterval 2 (from the above analysis): $x \\in (-\\infty, 3]$\nCombining these intervals: $x \\in (-\\infty, 3] \\cup (5, \\infty)$\nThis is the domain of the function $h(x)$.\nNow, to find the interval of the function with respect to its width, we subtract the start point from the end point.

We can see that $x^2 \\le 25$ for all $x$, so we only need to determine the solution set for $x \\ge 3$. Thus, $h(x)$ is defined on the interval $[3,6]$.

Therefore, $h(x)$ is increasing in this interval.\nWhen $x>6$, both $\\sqrt{25-x^2}$ and $\\sqrt{-(x-3)}$ are negative, so $h'(x)<0$. Therefore, $h(x)$ is decreasing in this interval.\nWhen $x=6$, $h'(x) = 0$.\nTherefore, the width of the interval is obtained by subtracting the smaller critical point (6) from the larger critical point (6), which gives us a width of $6-6 = \\boxed{0}$ units.",
