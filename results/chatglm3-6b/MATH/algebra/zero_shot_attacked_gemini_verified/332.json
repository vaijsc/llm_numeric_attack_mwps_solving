        "\nLet's call one of the numbers x.\nThe other number will then be 32 - x.\nAccording to the given information, we can create two equations:\nx + (32 - x) = 32\nx(32 - x) = 35\nFrom the first equation, we can simplify it to 32 - x = 0, further simplifying to x = 32.\nSubstituting x = 32 into the second equation, we get 32(32 - 32) = 35.\nThis doesn't provide a solution.\nIt seems like I made an error in my calculations. \nLet's try again.\nFrom the second equation, we have x^2 - 32x + 35 = 0.\nBy factoring or using the quadratic formula, we can find that the equation has a solution x = 5 and x = 7.\nHowever, x = 7 does not satisfy the condition that the sum of the two numbers is 32.\nTherefore, the only valid solution is x = 5.\nThe other number is 32 - 5 = 27.\nThe positive difference between the numbers is 7 - 5 = 2.\nThe final result: the positive difference between the numbers is 2.",
        " Let's call the numbers `x` and `y`:\n    x + y = 32   .......(1)\n    xy = 35      .......(2)\nWe know that if we square both sides of equation (1), we get:\n    x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = 32^2    .......(3)\nNow, subtracting equation (3) from equation (2), we have:\n    2xy = 35^2 - 32^2\n    2xy = (5 \\* 7)^2 - (6 \\* 8)^2\n    2xy = (5 + 7)(5 - 8)\n    2xy = -32\nDividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get:\n    xy = -16\nNow, let's solve the system of equations by substitution:\n    From equation (1), we can express `y` in terms of `x`:\n    y = 32 - x\nSubstituting the expression for `y` in terms of `x` into equation (2), we get:\n    x(32 - x) = 35\n    32x - x^2 = 35\n    x^2 - 32x + 35 = 0\nNow, we can factor this quadratic equation:\n    (x - 7)(x - 5) = 0\nLet's solve for `x` by setting each factor equal to zero:\n    x - 7 = 0 or x - 5 = 0\n    x = 7 or x = 5\nNow, let's substitute `x` with 5 and 7 in equation (1) to get the corresponding values of `y`:\n    For `x = 5`, y = 32 - 5 = 27\n    For `x = 7`, y = 32 - 7 = 25\nSo, we have two pairs of solutions: (x, y) = (5, 27) and (x, y) = (7, 25)\nThe positive difference between the numbers is:\n    |7 - ",
        "\nTo find the positive difference between the two numbers, we first need to find the two numbers themselves.\nLet's call the first number x.\nAccording to the given information, the sum of the two numbers is 32:\nx + y = 32\nAnd their product is 35:\nxy = 35\nWe can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of x and y.\nWe can multiply the first equation by y to eliminate y:\nxy + y^2 = 32y\nSubstituting the second equation into this equation, we get:\n35 + y^2 = 32y\nRearranging the equation, we have:\ny^2 - 32y + 35 = 0\nThis equation can be factored as:\n(y - 5)(y - 7) = 0\nSo we have two possible values for y: y = 5 or y = 7.\nIf y = 5, then substituting it into the first equation gives:\nx + 5 = 32\nSo x = 27.\nIf y = 7, then substituting it into the first equation gives:\nx + 7 = 32\nSo x = 25.\nIn either case, the values of x and y are 27 and 5 or 25 and 7, respectively.\nFinally, to find the positive difference between the two numbers, we subtract the smaller number from the larger number:\n|27 - 5| = 22 or |25 - 7| = 18\nTherefore, the positive difference between the numbers is 22 or 18."
