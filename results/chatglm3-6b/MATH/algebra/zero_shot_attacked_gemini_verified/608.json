We can assume that this expression is a geometric series. The first term of this series is $x$ and the common ratio is $r$. We can represent this series infinitely as $S=\\sqrt{x+\\sqrt{x+\\sqrt{x+\\ldots}}}$. Finally, we equate this expression to the middle term of the geometric sequence, which is $\\theta_n=-\\frac{1}{r^{n-1}}$. We found that the expression $S$ is equal to $\\sqrt{x\\frac{(1-r^n)}{(1-r)^n}}$ only when $r=1$ but not when $r\\neq 1$ or $x\\neq 0$. Therefore, the value of $x$ that satisfies the problem can be any real number except $0",
