        "\nThe formula for the nth term in an arithmetic sequence is given by $a_n = a_1 + (n - 1) \\cdot d$, where $a_1$ is the first term and $d$ is the common difference.\nIn this case, the first term $a_1 = 1$ and the common difference $d = 2$.\nTo find the 2403rd term, we can substitute $n = 2403$ into the formula:\n$a_{2403} = 1 + (2403 - 1) \\cdot 2$\nNow let's calculate:\n$a_{2403} = 1 + 2396 \\cdot 2$\n$a_{2403} = 1 + 4792$\n$a_{2403} = 4793$\nTherefore, the 2403rd term is 4793.\nThe answer is: 4793",
        " To find the 2403rd term of the sequence, we need to verify that the sequence of odd numbers continues. Let's check if the sum of the first $n$ odd numbers is equal to $n^2$.\nThe sum of the first $n$ odd numbers can be calculated using the formula: $1 + 3 + 5 + \\dots + (2n-1)$.\nUsing the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, we have:\n$1 + 3 + 5 + \\dots + (2n - 1) = \\frac{n}{2} \\cdot (2 \\cdot 1 - 2 \\cdot 2 + 4 \\cdot 1 - 1) = \\frac{n}{2} \\cdot (2-1 + 4 - 1) = \\frac{n}{2} \\cdot 3 = \\frac{3n}{2}$\nTo verify whether this sum is equal to $n^2$, we need to solve the equation $\\frac{3n}{2} = n^2$.\nSimplifying the equation, we have $3n = 2n^2$.\nDividing both sides by $2n$, we have $\\frac{3}{2} = n$.\nSince $n$ represents the position of the term in the sequence, $n$ must be an integer.\nTherefore, $\\boxed{n = 3}$.\nThe original sequence of odd numbers starts with 1. The 2403rd term is 2399.",
        " We notice that the pattern in the given sequence is that each term is increasing by 2 each time. \nWhen we divide 2403 by 2, we get a quotient of 1201 with a remainder of 1. \nSince the remainder is 1, the 2403rd term will be 1 more than the 1201st term. \nTherefore, the 2403rd term is $1+2(1201)=\\boxed{2403}$.",
        " To find the 2403rd term of the sequence, we can use the formula:\n$a_n = a_1 + (n - 1) \\cdot d$\nwhere $a_n$ is the $n$th term, $a_1$ is the first term, and $d$ is the common difference.\nIn this case, $a_1 = 1$ and $d = 2$.\nSubstituting $n = 2403$ and $a_1 = 1$, we get:\n$a_{2403} = 1 + (2403 - 1) \\cdot 2$\n$= 1 + 2399 \\cdot 2$\n$= 1 + 4798$\n$= \\boxed{4799}$.The answer is: 4799",
