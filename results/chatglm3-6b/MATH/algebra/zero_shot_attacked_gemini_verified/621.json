        " \nLet's call the two squares $x^2$ and $(x+1)^2$. We know that the positive difference between these two squares is 91. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n$|(x+1)^2 - x^2| = 91$\nTo solve this equation, we'll first get rid of the absolute value by considering the two cases: $x+1$ is positive and greater than $x$ as well as $x+1$ is negative and less than $x$ for each scenario, depending on the value of $x$. Thus, we have two separate cases:\n### Case 1: $x+1 > x$\nIn this case, $(x+1)^2 - x^2 = (x^2+2x+1-x^2) = 2x+1 = 91$\nNow we solve for $x$. We have $2x+1 = 91$, so $2x=90$ and $x=45$\nHowever, $x^2 = 45^2 = 2025$ and $(x+1)^2 = 46^2 = 2116$, so $x^2$(the greater square) is not equal to $(x+1)^2$. Ultimately, $x=45$ does not satisfy the condition that $(x+1)^2-x^2=91$.\n### Case 2: $x+1 < x$\nIn this case, we have $(x+1)^2 - x^2 = (x^2 + 2x + 1 - x^2) = 2x+1 = 91$\nHowever, in this scenario, the solution is also $x=45$, which is not viable. Therefore, there are no solutions for this case.\n### Conclusion\nSince there are no valid solutions for $x$ in either case, we cannot determine the greater square.\u5ddd\u5ddd\u7070\u7070\u4e8c\u6b21\u4f5c\u753b\n#### 3\nThe two squares are $5^2$ and $(5+1)^2$. \nThe problem asks for the positive difference between the two squares.
