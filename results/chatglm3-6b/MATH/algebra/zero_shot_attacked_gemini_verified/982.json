        " \nTo find the minimum value of $a^2 + 8a - 7$, we can rewrite the expression as $(a + 4)^2 - 11$. This is because completing the square gives $(a + 4)^2$. Since the square of a real number is always nonnegative, the minimum value of $(a + 4)^2$ is 0, which occurs when $a + 4 = 0$. Therefore, the minimum value of $a^2 + 8a - 7$ is $0 - 11 = \\boxed{-11}$.",
        "\nWe can solve this problem using the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula states that if $ax^2+bx+c=0$, then the solutions for $x$ are given by:\nx = (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a)\nTo apply this formula to the given expression, we need to compare it to the standard form $ax^2+bx+c=0$.\nComparing the expression $a^2+8a-7$ to the standard form, we can see that $a=a$, $b=8$, and $c=-7$.\nNow we can plug these values into the quadratic formula:\nx = (-8 \u00b1 sqrt(8^2 - 4(-7))) / (2a)\nSimplifying, we get:\nx = (-8 \u00b1 sqrt(64 + 28)) / (2a)\nx = (-8 \u00b1 sqrt(92)) / (2a)\nNow, we need to find the minimum value of this expression. We can do this by analyzing the square root part. The square root function only returns non-negative values, so we can ignore the negative square root in the denominator.\nThe expression simplifies to:\nx = (-8 + sqrt(92)) / (2a) or x = (-8 - sqrt(92)) / (2a)\nSince we want the minimum value of this expression, we should take the negative square root. Therefore, the minimum value is: x = (-8 - sqrt(92)) / (2a).\nTo find the minimum value, we can take the average of the two solutions: x = (-8 - sqrt(92)) / (2a) \u2248 x = (-8 - 3.132) / (2a) \u2248 x = (-11.132) / (2a)\nFinally, to calculate the average, we divide -11.132 by 2a:\nx \u2248 (-11.132) / (2a) \u2248 (-11.132) / (2 * -1.2).gerpet",
        "\nFirst, we have the quadratic expression $a^2+8a-7$. To find the minimum value of this expression, we can complete the square.\nWe start by adding $(8/2)^2=16$ to both sides of the expression, giving us \\[a^2+8a+16-22=-7.\\] Next, we can factor the left side of this expression as a $(a+4)^2$, so we have \\[(a+4)^2-22=-7.\\] We can then balance the equation by adding 22 to both sides, giving us \\[(a+4)^2=15.\\] Finally, taking the square root of both sides, we find \\[a+4=\\pm\\sqrt{15}.\\] Thus, to find the minimum value of the quadratic expression, we take the smaller of these two solutions for $a$.

        " To find the minimum value of $a^2+8a-7$, we can complete the square.\n1.

We have $a^2+8a-7=(a^2+8a+16)-23$.\n3. factoring the first three numbers on the left side gives $(a+4)^2-23$ so it will be equal to the minimum value when itDescribe the process of completing the square to find the minimum value of the expression $a^2+8a$. ### \n To find the minimum value of $a^2+8a$, we need to complete the square. Let's go step by step.\n1. The first step is to take the coefficient of $a$, which is 8, and divide it by 2. This gives us $\\frac{8}{2} = 4$.\n2.Next, we take the square of this value, which is $(4)^2 = 16$.\n3.Now we can add and subtract this value (16) to the expression. This gives us:\n$a^2 + 8a - 16 + 16$\n$= (a^2 + 8a + 16) - 16 + 16$\n$= (a + 4)^2$\n4. Now we have completed the square. The expression $(a + 4)^2$ is a perfect square trinomial, and its minimum value occurs when $a+4 = 0$, which gives us $a = -4$.\n5.

This is a parabola that opens upwards since the coefficient of $a^2$ is positive.\nCompleting the square, we need to add and subtract the square of half the coefficient of $a$. In this case, half of the coefficient of $a$ is $4/2 = 2$.
