Here's an example of how you can use the \"frame\" environment in LaTeX:\n```\n\\documentclass{article}\n\\usepackage[framemethod=TikZ]{framed}\n\\begin{document}\n\\begin{frame}{My frame}\n  This is my framed text.\n\\end{frame}\n\\end{document}\n```\nThis will create a box around the text using the TikZ graphics package, which allows for customization of the frame's shape, border style, and background color. For instance, you can change the frame's shape to be a rectangle with rounded corners, an ellipse, a triangle, or even a custom shape defined by a TikZ path.\n",

        " $f(g(2)) = f(2^2 + 3) = f(7) = 7 + 1 = \\boxed{8}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 8. I hope it is correct.tors.\nSolution: Recall the formula $f(g(x))$, which states that given two functions $f$ and $g$, $f(g(x))$ is the composition of the two functions $f$ and $g$ evaluated at the input $x$.\nNow, let\u2019s apply this formula to the problem. First, we start with $g(2) = 2^2 + 3 = 7$.\nNext, we apply $f$ to the expression above. Therefore, we have $f(g(2)) = f(7) = 7 + 1 = 8$. So, the answer is 8.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 8. I hope it is correct.",
        " First, we will calculate $g(2) = 2^2 + 3 = 7$. Now, we have $f(g(2))$ and now we need to substitute $g(2)$ in the function $f$:\n### f(g(2)) = f(7) = 7 + 1 = \\boxed{8}\nDo you need more help with this problem? You can share it and I'll try my best to help you understand how to solve it. Thank you. \nLet me know if you need any further assistance or if there\u2019s anything else I can do for you.

        "  Given $g(2) = 2^2+3=4+3=7$. Then, $f(g(2))= f(7)=7+1=8$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 8. I hope it is correct.  ### instructor: Great job! The function $f$ is a shift of 1, which means that changing $x$ to $x+1$ changes the value of $f(x)$ by 1.  In other words, $f(x+1)=f(x)+1$.  On the other hand, the function $g$ is a shift of 3 and a squaring.  In other words, $g(x+3)=g(x)+(3x+3)=x^2+3x+6$.  So, if we find $g(2)$, and then we shift it to the right by 1, which is to add 1 to the value, we will get $f(g(2))$.  Let\u2019s compute $g(2)=2^2+3=4+3=7$, which is the answer $f(7)=7+1=\\boxed{8}$.\n### "
