Thus the above set does not include any values of $x$ or $y$ that are factors of 56 and are positive integer-distinct. So $x=8, 2\\le a \\text{ or } a < 1.75$, $b=0",
        " \nStep 1: $x \\times y=56$\nFrom this, we can say that $x \\times y = x \\times (56 / x) = 56$, so $y = 56 / x$, which implies $x < 56 / x$, or $x^2 < 56$, so $x < 8$.\nStep 2: $7/x+14y=4$\nHowever, we can just tell at a glance that this will be tricky to solve for $x$, so we can try to factorise $7/x + 14y$.\nLet's see, $(7/x)+14y=14(y+1/7x)$. But this seems hard to factorise, so maybe instead we could find the factors of 56, multiply 7 by one of these and 14 by another, see if the expression $7/x + 14y$ can be expressed this way.\nIf $x \\times y=56$, then $x=56$ or $56y=x$.\nNow, let's try different factors of 56:\n* 7, 8, which gives $7 \\times 7 + 8 \\times 7 = 49 + 56$, very close\n* 8, 7 which gives 7 \\times 8 + 8 \\times 7 = 56 + 42 = 98, nope\n* 8, 7 which gives 7 \\times 8 56 42... wait, this is the same as above\n* 7, 8, which gives 7 \\times 7 + 8 \\times 7 = 49 + 56\u2026 argh!\nWhy isn't this simplifying? Because when we computed $7y$ and set it equal to $56 /x$, we made an error.\nStep 3: Simplifying $7y$\nRecall $y=56/x$, so $7y = 7(56/x) = 392 /x$.\nNow, $7/x+14y$ is not so bad: $(7/x)+14y = 7/x+392/x = 399/x$.\nStep 4: $399/x=4$\nNow, we can solve: $399=x$, and this is our answer.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 399.

        " 8\nStep 1. Since the product of $x$ and $y$ is 56, we know that they are 8 and 7:\n$x = 8$\n$y = 7$\nStep 2. Since $x < y$, we know that $x = 8$ and $y = 7$ are the correct solution.\nStep 3.

        " Since $x < y$, we can let $x = a$ and $y = b$ such that $ab = 56$ (where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers).  In other words, $ab$ is their product.  We know $x < y$ means $a < b$.  Rearranging gives\n$$\\frac{7}{a} + 14\\frac{1}{b} = \\frac{7b + 14a}{ab} = 4.$$So, multiplying both sides by $ab$ yields\n$$7b + 14a = 4ab.$$Given that $ab = 56$ (by $ab$ is the product of $x$ and $y$), we have $7b + 14a = 224$, which yields \\begin{align*}\n7b &= 224 - 14a\\\\\nb&=32-2a.\n\\end{align*}Since $a < b$, we have $a < 32/2 = 16$, so $a$ can be 1, 2, . . ., 15. Checking all the values, we find $a = \\boxed{7}$, which also satisfies $b = 8$ according to the equation for $b$ above.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 7.
