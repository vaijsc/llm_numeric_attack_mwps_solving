        " \nLet\u2019s analyze the problem. We are given that a rectangular prism with integer side lengths has a height of 3. We want to find the volume of this prism given that the surface area is 52.\nThe surface area of a rectangular prism is given by $$SA = 2lw + 2lh + 2wh,$$where $l$ is the length of the prism, $w$ is the width, and $h$ is the height. We are given that $h=3$, and we want the surface area to be 52. So we can set up an equation: $$2lw+2l\\cdot 3+2w\\cdot3=52.$$We can simplify this to get $$2w\\cdot l+(\\text{other stuff})=52.$$We are asking for the volume of the prism, which is given by $V = lwh$. Since $h=3$, we can rewrite this as $$V = lw\\cdot 3.$$We can set up an equation for this to solve for $V$:\n$$lw\\cdot 3=52$$Here\u2019s the tricky part, though: there are infinitely many combinations of side lengths $l$ and $w$ that will give us a surface area of 52. So we can\u2019t find a unique answer for the volume by solving this equation. But we can narrow it down by making some smart guesses about the side lengths! First, $w$ and $l$ are both integer, so they can\u2019t be 0. This means that the least possible length of $lw$ is 1. So for example, we know that $lum \u2264 52$ for $l=1, w=52$. This implies that $l$ and $w$ are both less than 52. (Of course, this is assuming that they are both 1!)\nNow we can say that $lw < 52$. (A little more rigorously, we could say that $lw \u2264 51$, but then there\u2019s still only 51 possible pairs of $l$ and $w$, so that\u2019s probably overthinking it.) This might not seem like a problem, but we can use this to guess and prove that the smallest possible volume of the prism is 6 cubic. Now we can look at all the possible pairs of $l$ and $w$ and find the one with the least volume.\n### Answer: \nThe final answer is $6$. I hope it is correct. A video",

        " \nTo solve this problem, we will need to figure out the dimensions of the rectangular prism. If the rectangular prism has integer side lengths, we know that it will look something like this $\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \\hline a & b & b \\\\ \\hline a & c & c \\\\ \\hline a & c & c \\\\ \\hline\\end{array}$. The surface area of this prism is equal to $52$, so we can set up the equation $2a^2+2bc = 52$. This simplifies to $a^2+bc = 26$. We also know that $\\boxed{3a=bc}$ from the information given. We can set these equations equal to each other: $a^2+3a = 26$. We can solve for $a$ using the quadratic equation: $a = \\frac{-3 + \\sqrt{9+4\\cdot26}}{2}$, and $a = \\frac{-3-\\sqrt{9+4\\cdot26}}{2}$. The answer must be an integer, so the numerator of $\\frac{-3+\\sqrt{9+4\\cdot26}}{2}$ equals $0$, and $9+4\\cdot26=69$. $-\\sqrt{69}$ is irrational, but $9+4\\cdot26$ gives us $69$, so $a = \\frac{-2\\sqrt{69}}{2}$, or $a = -\\sqrt{69}$. The answer is irrational, so we plug in $a$ to find the volume of the prism: $V=abc=3abc = 3ab^2 = 3a(-2ab^2)^{3/2}$ where the last equation comes from the fact that $3a = bc$. $-a = \\frac{\\sqrt{bc}}{2}$ so we have the volume equal to $3bc$. Plugging in $a$ and $bc$, we have $3 \\cdot 3(-\\sqrt{69})$, and $-\\sqrt{69} \\cdot 3 = -\\sqrt{207}$, and so our final answer is\n$\\boxed{-\\sqrt{207}}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -\\sqrt{207}.

This gives: $$2 lw+2 l w+6 l=52.$$Simplifying, we get: $$4 l w=52-12=40.$$ Thus, $w=\\frac{40}{4l}=\\frac{10}{l}$, so $l$ divides 10. Clearly $l\\geq 2$ to ensure a larger surface area. The possible $l$ values are 2, 5, and 10. We can verify that the surface area is insufficient for $l=2$ and $l=10$, but the surface area is sufficient for $l=5$, and the corresponding $w$ value is 2, which is the only integer side length possible. Then, the volume of the prism is $$lwh =5\\cdot2\\cdot3=\\boxed{30}.$$ Final Answer: The final answer is 30.

        " The volume of a prism is equal to $lwh,$ where $l,$ $w,$ and $h$ are the length, width, and height, respectively. Since $w$ and $l$ have to be positive integers, we have\n$$l^2+w^2=(2\\cdot52)-3^2=44=(\\text{prime})$$or$$l^2+w^2=4\\cdot11=(2\\times2)\\times11.$$Then $l$ and $w$ must each be even, and by the Pythagorean theorem, $lw=4\\times(12-2)=40$. This implies that $l=5$ and $w=8$, so $h=3$. Therefore, the volume of the prism is $\\boxed{60}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 60. I hope it is correct.",

        " \nLet's start by thinking about the surface area. We have 2*Area of the base + 2*Area of each lateral surface area of the prism.Since we also know that the height of the prism is 3, and we are looking for integer side lengths, we know that our base must be 2*2*2+3, but we are looking for rectangular prism so we can get maximum surface area, We should pick for\u00a0\u00a0base\u00a0\u00a02*3*3\u00a0.\nSo the surface area equation is:\n2(9)+2(6h)=52\n12+12h=52\n12+12h-12=52-12\n12h=40\nh=40/12\nh=10/3=5/3\nNow we are looking for the volume\u00a0\u00a0of the 52 rectangular prism. Now the base is height of 3 and length of 5 units, width of 4, with\u00a0\u00a0a height of 3, so we can get volume of the prism by the formula:\nV=3*5*4=60.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 60.

        " \nLet $l$ and $w$ be the side length of the prism. We know that $S = 2lw + 2lh + 2wh$, where $S$ is the surface area and $V = lwh$. We\u2019re told that $S = 52$, and we need to find $V$. \nFrom the given $S = 52$, we have: $2lw + 2lh + 2wh = 52$. \nSimplifying this, we have $l(2w + 2h) + 2wh = 52$. \nNow, we can substitute $h=3$. \nNew equation is: $l(2w + 6) + 2w\\cdot 3 = 52$. \nThis can be simplified as: $2l w + 6l + 6w = 52$. \nNow, subtract $2l w$ and $6w$ and add on the right side. \nNew equation is: $2l w = 52 - 6l - 6w$. \nNow, divide by $2lw$ on both sides. \nWe get: $1 = \\frac{52 - 6l - 6w}{2lw}$. \nNote that the above equation is like a quadratic in terms of $l$, but because $6l$ and $6w$ are not squared, we cannot easily solve for $l$ directly. So, let\u2019s do another thing. \nWe can express this as: $12 - 6(l+w) = l w$. \nSo, $(l + w)^2 = l w + 6(l + w) + 36$.\nNow, we can expand $(l + w)^2$. \nThis gives us: $l^2 + 2lw + w^2 = lw + 6l + 6w + 36$. \nThis is a quadratic. \nSolving this, we get: $l^2 + 2lw + w^2 - lw - 6l - 6w - 36 = 0$. \nSo, $(l-3)(l+w-12) = 0$. \nFrom here we get two solutions: $(l, w) = (3, 3)$ and $(l, w) = (12, 9)$. \nFrom this, we can derive the volumes: \nFor $(l, w) = (3, ",
        " Let x be the length of the prism and y be the width of the prism.  The volume of the prism is xy\\cdot 3, which is 3xy.  Also, the area of the prism is 2xy + 2yx + 3y = 2xy + 2yx + 3y, and we know that area is 52.  Therefore, 2xy + 2yx + 3y = 52. Since y is an integer and xy should be an integer for the length and width of the prism to be integers, we factor xy out of (vox and cancel them out, getting 2y(x + y) = 52.  We test the factors of 52 with different sum pair. We know that 2y = 52, so y = 52/2 = 26.  However, there is no integer x combination of that can make the total surface area equal (52.  Therefore we try other options.  Next test is 2y = 26, which results y = 26/2 = 13. This is a possibility.  We next divide 52 into a product of integers and find x and y. Now, 2y(x + y) = 52. We get 2{\\large *}13*(x + 13) = 52.  Since there are not two integer coefficients, we can solve for x + 13: $$\\frac{52}{26}=2$$, which is $\\boxed{x=1$.  We can use 3xy or volume = 3xy.

        " The surface area of a right rectangular prism with length $l$, width $w$ and height $h$ is given by the formula $2lw+2lh+2wh$, so \\begin{align*}\n2lw+2lh+2wh&=52.\n\\end{align*}If we subtract $2lh$ and $2wh$ from each side, then we obtain $2lw=52-2lh-2wh$.  For the sake of simplicity, let\u2019s assume $l<w$.  Then $2w(l-h)=52-2wh$, or $l-h=\\frac{52-2wh}{2w}$.  As $l$ and $h$ are integers, so must be the RHS.  Therefore, as the height, $h$ of the prism, is 3, $\\frac{52-2\\cdot3\\cdot w}{2w}$ must be an integer.  When we calculate this and compare it to all the possible integer values of $l-w$, we see that only when $w=5$, can it occur that $l-h$ is an integer.  We are now certain that $l=5$, $w=5$ and $h=3$.  Then the volume of the prism is $\\boxed{3\\cdot 5\\cdot 5=75}$ units$^3$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 3\\cdot 5\\cdot 5 = 75. I hope it is correct. ###### Explanation The surface area of a rectangular prism is $2lw+2lh+2wh$. So, in our case, it is $2lw+2(3)l+2(3)w=2l(5+w)$. We know that the surface area is $52$. So we have: $$52=2l(5+w)$$ $52/2 = 5+w$ $26 = 5+w$ $w=26-5$ $w=21$ ###### Justification This doesn't look correct. The original solution says that $l=w$. But in this solution, $l$ and $w$ are not equal, which is a contradiction. Also, the calculation $w=26-5$ doesn't make sense in this problem because we don't know what $w$ is. ###### Conclusion The problem solving approach is incorrect and misleading. The final answer may not be accurate. This problem requires that we use trial",
