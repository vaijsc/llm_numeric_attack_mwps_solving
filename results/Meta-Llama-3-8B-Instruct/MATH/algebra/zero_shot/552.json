        " To run a distance $D$ in a time $T$, the rate $R$ at which we run is equal to the distance divided by the time run.

On the way back, we\u2019re running at rate $16-4x$ miles per hour and the distance, $D_1$, is the same, at the time $T_2=4$ hours.

        " \nLet\u2019s analyze the distance I ran. On the way to the park, it took me $3$ hours to run at a rate of $x^2$ miles per hour, so I ran a total distance of $x^2\\cdot 3 = 3x^2$. Similarly, on the way back, I ran a distance of $(16-4x)\\cdot 4=64-16x$.\n### Distance Run = Total Distance\nThe distance I ran is $3x^2$ and the total distance is the sum of what I ran on the way to the park and on the way back. So, $x^2\\cdot3+(64-16x)=3x^2+64-16x$. In order to simplify this expression, let\u2019s distribute the $3$ to the $x^2$: $3x^2+3\\cdot 64-3\\cdot 16x$\nNow, add all of the terms: $3x^2+192-48x$.\n### Equate the two: \nSince the distance I ran is $3x^2$ and the total distance is $3x^2+192-48x$, then we can have $3x^2=3x^2+192-48x$. Let\u2019s move the right-hand side to the left-hand side first: $192-48x=0$.\n### Subtract 192: \n$-48x=-192$.\n### Divide by negative 48: \nNow we can divide both sides of the equation by -48. $$x=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\frac{1}{2}$.

        " First, the total distance I need to run is $3x^2+4(16-4x)$. This is because I run $3x^2$ miles at $x^2$ miles per hour for $3$ hours, and I run $4(16-4x)$ miles at $16-4x$ miles per hour for $4$ hours.\nThe total distance equals $3x^2+4(16-4x)=3x^2+64-16x$. The rate at which I return is lower than the rate at which I traveled to the park, so I lose time - or, in this language, I run a bit under $3x^2$ miles per hour on average. This can happen only if $64-16x<3x^2$, which gives $$ 64-16x<3x^2 \\Rightarrow x^2-16x+64<0.$$Factoring the left side, we obtain $$(x-8)^2<0.$$Since the square of any real number is nonnegative, the left side of the inequality can only be less than zero if the entire expression is equal to zero.

So the distance is $\\left[16t - 2t^2 \\right]|^4_0 = 64 - 32 = 32$ miles.\nWe run the same path to and from the park, so the total distance we cover is $3 + 3 = 6$ miles.
