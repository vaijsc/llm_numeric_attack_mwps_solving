        " Domain of definition\nA function can be written as a sum of an even and an odd function. The even part of a function is the part that doesn't change when $x$ is replaced by $-x$. The odd part of a function is the part that changes by a factor of $-1$ when $x$ is replaced by $-x$.\nThis function has even parts: $|x^2+3x-4|$ = $|x+1||x-4|$ and $|x^2+9x+20|$ = $|(x+5)||(x+4)|$. Both are even and thus the function is nonnegative. Since $f(x)=\\frac{1}{|x^2+3x-4|+|x^2+9x+20|}$, $f$ always has the same value and is always real. Function f is well defined except where it has a zero value (Where it is undefined).\n### How to approach this\nSet both denominators equal to 0. Let $f(x)=\\frac{1}{|x^2+3x-4|+|x^2+9x+20|}=0$.\nThis can be simplified to $|x+1||x-4|+|(x+5)||(x+4)|=0$, which is the same as $|x^2+3x-4|=-(x-4)(x+5)$. The solutions are $x=-1$ and $x=4$.\nFinal Answer: The final answers are x=-1 and x=4. I hope it is correct.  Please correct me if there is anything incorrect.

Let\u2019s consider their domains separately.\nStep 2: For the first expression, solove $x+4=0 \\Longleftrightarrow x=-4$ and $x-1=0 \\Longleftrightarrow x=1$. For the second expression, solve $x+5=0 \\Longleftrightarrow x=-5$ and $x+4=0 \\Longleftrightarrow x=-4$.\nThe absolute values are only undefined when taking the square root for negative numbers, which doesn\u2019t happen for $|x^2+3x-4|$ since $(x+4)(x-1)\\ge0$, but they do happen for $|x^2+9x+20|$ since $(x+5)(x+4)\\le0$. Thus, we can conclude that the domain of $f$ is the set of real values of $x$ except $x=-4,-5,1$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -4,-5,1. I hope it is correct. \n### Solution (1)\nConsider the domains of each expression inside the absolute value signs separately. The domain of $|x^2+3x-4|$ is all real numbers except $x=-4, 1$. The domain of $|x^2+9x+20|$ is all real numbers. Therefore, the domain of $f$ is all real numbers except $-4$ and $1$.\n### Solution (2)\nNote that $|x^2+3x-4|+|x^2+9x+20|>0$ for all real $x$ except $x=-4$ and $1$. Thus, $f$ has no $x$ intercepts and the domain of $f$ is the set of all real numbers except $-4$ and $1$.\n### Solution (3)\nBy the definition of an absolute value, the absolute value function is a piecewise continuous function with the following set of intervals:\n\\begin{align*}\nf(x)&=\\frac{1}{|x^2+3x-4|+|x^2+9x+20|} \\\\\nx&< -4 \\quad \\text{or} \\",
        " \nSince we know $|x^2+3x-4|=\\sqrt{(x^2+3x-4)^2}$, we have\n$f(x)=\\frac{1}{|x^2+3x-4|+|x^2+9x+20|} =\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{(x^2+3x-4)^2}+\\sqrt{(x^2+9x+20)^2}}$.\nThe radicand in both terms must be greater than or equal to 0.\n$$\\begin{eqnarray}\n(x^2+3x-4)^2&=&x^4+6x^3-12x^2+9x^2+27x-16\\ge0\\\\\nx^4+6x^3+15x^2+27x-16&\\ge0\\\\\n(x+8)(x^3-2x-2)&\\ge0\n\\end{eqnarray}$$\n$$(x+8)(x^3-2x-2)\\ge0\\implies x+8\\ge0, x^3-2x-2\\ge0$$\n$$x\\ge-8, \\quad x^3-2x-2\\ge0$$\nAlso, $$x^4+9x^2+90x+80=(x^2+3x-4)(x^2+9x+20)+16$$, and when we need to find the real values of $x$ that are not in the domain of $f(x)$, $x^2+9x+20$ should be negative, since the absolute value of a negative number is positive. $$(x^2+9x+20)<0\\implies (x+5)^2<20$$\n$$x+5<-4\\quad \\textrm{or}\\quad x+5>4$$\n$$x<-9\\quad \\textrm{or}\\quad x>-5$$\nThus, $f(x)$ is only defined when $x\\in\\boxed{(-9,-5)\\cup(-\\infty,-8]}$. Note that $f$ is defined at all points in the interval $(-9,-5)$ since $f$ is defined at all points off the intervals $(-8,\\infty)$ and $\\boxed{(-\\infty,-9]}$",
        " From the given equation, we may see that $f(x)=\\frac{1}{|x^2+3x-4|+|x^2+9x+20|}$.\n### Absolute value inside\nWe use $|x^2+3x-4|=(x+4)(x-1)$ and $|x^2+9x+20|=(x+5)(x+4)$. These are valid for all real $x$.\n### Equation to get\nSubstituting will get $f(x)=\\frac{1}{(x+4)(x-1)+(x+5)(x+4)}=\\frac{1}{x^2+x-4+x^2+5x+20}=\\frac{1}{2x^2+6x+24}$.\n### Roots\nThe denominator is a quadratic in $x$. If the roots of $2x^2+6x+24$ are found.\n### Finding roots\nThe roots of $2x^2+6x+24$ can be found by Factoring or by the quadratic formula.\n### Factoring\n$2x^2+6x+24=2(x^2+3x+12)=2((x+2)(x+6))$, which factors to $2(x+2)(x+6)$. That shows the roots are $x=-2$ and $x=-6$.\n### Fast answer\nThe answers are: $\\boxed{x=-2, x=-6}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is x=-2, x=-6. I hope it is correct.  I hope you get the idea. Thank you for your instructions. I have provided the workings below. Adjust your exercise to maintain a variety of exercises with a range of difficulties using absolute value expressions in the denominator. \nThe quadratic formula is unaffected by the coefficients of the $x^2$ term. it will still work out well. The same thing applies when we can determine factors for $x^2+bx+c$ using our factors for $a{x^2}+2ax+c$ where $a=1$ just like we did in this exercise.\nReferences:\n* Function Domain Problems\n* How to Factored Quadratic Equations\n* Quadratic Equation Formula\nNote: \nWe can solve the quadratic equation $2x^2+6x+24=0$ to find the roots by factoring it as $2(x+",
        " To determine the domain of $f$, we must consider the values of $x$ for which each absolute value in the expression is undefined. Therefore, we first set the absolute values equal to zero and solve for $x$. Solving for $x$ in the expressions $|x^2+3x-4|=0$ and $|x^2+9x+20|=0$, we obtain:\n\\begin{align*}\nx^2+3x-4&=0\\Rightarrow (x+4)(x-1)=0\\Rightarrow x=-4,~1,\\\\\nx^2+9x+20&=0\\Rightarrow (x+10)(x+2)=0\\Rightarrow x=-10,~ -2\n\\end{align*}\nThe expression $|x^2+3x-4|$ is undefined when $x=-4$, $1$ and the expression $|x^2+9x+20|$ is undefined when $x=-10$, $-2$. Hence the absolute value expression $|x^2+3x-4|+|x^2+9x+20|$ is undefined when $x=-4$, $-10$, $1$, and $-2$. These values of $x$ are in the domain of $f$.\n### Explanation:\nAccording to the graph (or the expression of the function), the points of discontinuity in $x$ axis where the graph have a gap in the graph are $x=1$,$x=-4$,$x=-2$,$x=-10$ Now since, $f(x)$ can be evaluated at any real number except at those points of discontinuity. So, for instance, $\\boxed{x=-4,~1,-2,-10}$ are the only real values for which the function is not defined. is in the domain of $f$ only if it is equal neither $-4$ nor $1$ nor $-2$ nor $-10$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -4,1,-2,-10. I hope it is correct.ostaal curry!what remainder REMAIN (not remains).\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -4,1,-2,-10. I hope it is correct.ostaal curry!what remainder REMAIN (not remains).erved.

        " The domain will be that set of real numbers where the given function $f(x)$ is undefined or not real defined. Since the denominator would be undefined if the expression inside the absolute value symbol becomes zero. So for the given function, the set of real values where the denominator becomes zero. That is, $$|x^2+3x-4|=-|x^2+3x-4|$$ $$\\text{or } |x^2+9x+20|=-|x^2+9x+20|$$ But the absolute value function always returns to the positive value of the expression, hence the both are impossible. Therefore, the function is not undefined, that implies zero is not the domain. Or we can say that the domain includes all real values of $x$ except zero. So, we can also say that the given function is defined at all real values of $x$ except $x=0$. Hence, the domain of given function $f(x)$ is all real values of $x$ except zero. ### Final Answer: The final answer is x \\ne 0 or x\\neq 0. I hope it is correct.

To be defined, this expression requires neither $x^2+3x-4$ nor $x^2+9x+20$ to be zero. Therefore, we need to guarantee that $x^2+3x-4$ and $x^2+9x+20$ are both nonzero.\nWe can do this by factoring.
