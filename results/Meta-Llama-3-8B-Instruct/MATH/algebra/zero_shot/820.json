        " \nLet $n$ be the smaller even perfect square.  Then $n$ is a positive multiple of $4$, so $n = 4k$ for some positive integer $k$.  Thus, the larger even perfect square is $(n+4k)^2$.  So we have\n$$\n(n+4k)^2-n^2 = 268.\n$$\nFactoring, we have\n$$\n4k^2 + 4k = 268,\n$$\nor\n$$\nk^2 + k = 67.\n$$\nSo $k = 6$, and the larger even perfect square is\n$$\n(n+4k)^2 = 4k^2+8k+n = 272 + n.\n$$\nNow, $n$ must also be a perfect square.  Let $n = 4m^2$ for some positive integer $m$.  Then the larger even perfect square is\n$$\n4k^2+8k+4m^2 = 272 + 4m^2.\n$$\nWe know that this square is a perfect square.  Let $x^2$ be its value.  Then we have\n$$\nx^2 = 272+4m^2 \\Leftrightarrow x = \\sqrt{272+4m^2}.\n$$\nIt remains to find $x^2$ that is an integer.  If $m = 2$, we get $x^2 = 4(5)^2 = 100.$\nTherefore, the larger even perfect square is $n+404 = 100+404 = \\boxed{504}$.  (Note that $m = 1$ gives $x^2 = 265$, not an integer.  And $m = 3$ gives $x^2 = 269$, not an integer.)\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 504. I hope it is correct. ",
        " \nLet $n^2$ be the larger.  That is, $(n+1)^2=n^2+2n+1<268+1=269$. Since the second square is at most 269, the first one is less than the square of a number less than $\\sqrt{269}$. The last digit of $(n+1)^2$ is 1, 4, 9, 6, and 5 indicate that $n$ is 7, 4, 1, 6, and 5, respectively.\nSince the next square is larger than $n^2$ by 268, and since it has the same units digit as $n^2$, we know that it is 1 larger, which implies $n=5$.

        " We are referring to the fact that $n^2$ is even if and only if $n$ is even.  So if $n^2$ and $(n+1)^2$ are both even, we have\n$$(n+1)^2-n^2=2n+1.$$\nNow we know that $2n+1=268$, because that is the problem.  Subtracting 1 from both sides, we get\n$$2n=267,$$or $n=267/2=133.5$.  This is impossible because $n$ is supposed to be an integer, so we can discard the positive root.\nThe negative root gives $n=-267/2=-133.5$, which is also impossible for the same reason.  The problem now is that we have only found half of the two consecutive even perfect squares, namely 8444 and 8364.\nTo find the second one, or the larger one, note that\n$$n=133\\implies n^2=17849.$$Then you can check that $17849+268=17917=(n+1)^2=n^2+2n+1$.  Therefore, $n+1=\\boxed{134}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 134.

The correct answer is not 134, but I will still continue.\nHere\u2019s a better way to finish the problem.\nUsing difference of squares, we have $(n+1)^2-n^2=2n+1$.  Since $268=2n+1$, we can subtract 1 from both sides to get $2n=267$.  Divide both sides by 2 to get $n=132.5$, which is impossible for an integer.  Because of this, we are forced to try $n+1$, which gives us $n+1=267/2+1=268/2+1$, giving us $n+1=\\boxed{134}$.",

        " \n$(x+1)^2-x^2=x+1-x=1$.  Therefore, each incremental even perfect square is 1 more than the previous one.  The difference between two consecutive even perfect squares is an odd number, and the only odd number that is close to 268 is 270.  So, $x^2+(x+1)^2-x^2-(x+1)^2=270$, or $(x+1)^2-x^2=270$.  The difference between two even perfect squares is also the difference of two consecutive odd perfect squares.  Solving this equation, $(2x+1)^2-(2x)^2=270$, or $4x^2+4x+1-4x^2=270$, or $4x+1=269$.

        " 268 is the difference between two consecutive even perfect squares.\nSince the squares are consecutive even, if $(2x)^2$ is the larger of the squares, then $(2x - 2)^2$ must be the smaller of the squares.  Now, $(2x)^2 - (2x - 2)^2 = 268.$  Expanding this expression, we obtain $4x^2 - (4x^2 - 8x + 4) = 268,$ or $8x - 4 = 268,$ which yields $x = 35.$  Thus, the larger square is $\\boxed{(2\\cdot35)^2 = 2500}$.\nWe can also use the fact that each consecutive square goes up by an increment of $2n$, where $n$ is an integer.  The possible consecutive squares have a difference of $0, 4, 16, 36, \\ldots$.  However, since we are looking for the difference $268$, this must not be $0, 4, 16, 36$, or $64$, so it must be $108, 144, 196, 256, \\ldots$.

So, (m+1)^2 = 4k1 + k1^2 +1 , So, 4(m+1)^2 = 4K2 , Where K2 is an integer > 0. Since m >= 1 , (m+1)^2 > 1, then K2 >= 1, now, 4(m+1)^2 = 4k2 >= 4 => k2 >= 1 and (m+1)^2 = 4k2 , So, k2 = (m+1)^2/4 , Therefore, k1 = sqrt(m^2 + 168m + 641)/2 So",

        " Let the squares be $x^2$ and $y^2$.  We have that $y^2-x^2=268$.  Since the squares are even, $x$ and $y$ are even, so $x = ka$ and $y = lb$, where $a,b$ are odd integers.  Then we have $$k^2 a^2 - l^2 b^2 = 268,$$ and since all terms are positive, $$k^2 a^2 = l^2 b^2 + 268.$$Notice that since $l^2 b^2$ is an even square, the right hand side is even.  Also, since $k^2 a^2$ is a perfect square, the left hand side is odd.  Therefore, we cannot have $k^2 a^2 = l^2 b^2 + 268$, a contradiction.\nSo we must tweak our approach slightly.  Let $x = m^2$, $y = n^2$ where $m,n$ are positive integers.  Then we have $$y - x = n^2 - m^2 = 268,$$ or $$(n-m)(n+m) = 268.$$Notice that $n + m$ cannot be even, since in that case we would have $$(n-m)(n+m) = 2k$$ for some integer $k \\ge 1$, implying $n = (k + 1)^2$ and $m = (k-1)^2$, which would lead to $x^2 = y^2$, a contradiction.  So $n + m$ is odd, which means that $n - m$ must also be odd.  Since their product is even, we must have $n - m$ even, or $n - m = 2k$ for some integer $k$.  Then $$n = m + 2k.$$  We can solve for $m$ by doing $$m = \\frac{n}{1 + 2/k}.$$  The numerator $n$ is even, so there must be an even value of $n$ such that $n/2 = m\u2019$, say.
