The square of the binomial $x-y$ is:\n$$(x-y)^2=(x+y)^2-4xy=24-4xy.$$Now, we know that $(x+y)^2=x^2+y^2+2xy$. After substitution $x^2+y^2=24$ from the problem, we get $$24-4xy=x^2+y^2+2xy\\Rightarrow 2xy=24.$$We also know that $x-y=6$, so $x+y=6+y-y=6$. Then, $(x+y)^2=36$. So, $$36=x^2+y^2+2xy=24+2(12)=48.$$Now, we can find $x^2+xy+y^2$.\n$$x^2+y^2+xy=48\\Rightarrow x^2+xy+y^2+xy=48+xy$$Since $2xy=24$, $xy=12$. Then $48+xy=48+12=60$. Now, we can find the value of $x^3-y^3$.\n$$x^3-y^3=(x-y)(x^2+xy+y^2)=6\\cdot60=\\boxed{360}$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 360.
