Therefore, the difference is 8 - 4 = $\\boxed{4}$.\nStep-by-step solution (simplified version)\n1. \u221a64 is the positive square root of 64, which is equal to 8 (based on square root calculator and calculation).\n2. \u00b3\u221a64 is the cube root of 64, which is equal to 4 (based on cube root calculator and calculation).\n3. 8 - 4 = 4, so the difference is 4.  Therefore, the correct answer is 4.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 4. I hope it is correct."
