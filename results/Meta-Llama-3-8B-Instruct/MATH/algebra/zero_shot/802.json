        " Looking at the terms of the given equation, we can easily simplify the expression. \\begin{align*} x\\sqrt{x}-5x-9\\sqrt{x}&=35\\\\ x\\sqrt{x}-9\\sqrt{x}-5x&=35\\\\ \\sqrt{x}\\left(x-9\\right)-5x&=35\\\\ \\sqrt{x}\\left(x-9\\right)-5x+25&=35+25\\\\ \\left(\\sqrt{x}-5\\right)\\left(x-9\\right)&=60\\\\ \\end{align*}\nNow, we can factor out an $x$ and simplify. \\begin{align*} \\left(\\sqrt{x}-5\\right)\\left(x-9\\right)&=60\\\\ \\left(x-9\\right)\\left(\\sqrt{x}-5\\right)&=60\\\\ x\\sqrt{x}-9\\sqrt{x}-5x+45&=60\\\\ x\\sqrt{x}-5x-9\\sqrt{x}+45&=60\\\\ x\\sqrt{x}-5x-9\\sqrt{x}&=15\\\\ \\end{align*}\nLooking at the simplified equation, we can conclude that if the LHS is 15, the RH side is also 15, but it is given that the RHS is 35. Hence, the LHS cannot be 15. It must be the LHS is not equal to 15 and LHS = 35.\nLooking at the terms of the simplified equation, we see that the only term that can be added to the RHS to give 35 is $x\\sqrt{x}.$ So, we can equate it to 35. \\begin{align*} x\\sqrt{x}-5x-9\\sqrt{x}&=35\\\\ x\\sqrt{x}-35&=5x+9\\sqrt{x}\\\\ \\sqrt{x}(x-9)-5x&=35\\\\ \\left(x-9\\right)\\sqrt{x}-5x&=35\\\\ \\left(\\sqrt{x}-5\\right)\\left(x-9\\right)&=\\color{red}{0}\\\\ \\end{align*}\nNow, we can see that the common factor of the equation is $(\\sqrt{x}-5)$, hence, we can equate the expression to 0 and rearrange accordingly. $\\begin{equation*} \\left(\\sqrt{x}-5\\right)\\left(x-9\\right)=0\\\\ \\sqrt{x",
        " Assume that $x$ is an integer. Substitute it with the smaller numbers $x=0,-1,-2,1,-2,-3$. You can easily verify that $x$ cannot be equal to $0$ as it would result in $0=35$, and cannot be equal to $1,2,3$ as it would result in non-integer solutions.  Next, substitute it with $x=-1,-2,-3$.\nAfter substituting, you may find that $x$ cannot be equal to $-1$ as it would result in $-x+5x+9=35$. It is much easier to verify that $x=-4, -5, -6, -7, -8$ leads to integer solutions. Of these numbers, $x=-4$ is the only one satisfying $x$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is x=-4. I hope it is correct.\n# Solution\n\"Wong\"\nLet us define the expression $E(x) = x\\sqrt{x}-5x-9\\sqrt{x}-35$. To solve the problem, we need to find $x$ such that $E(x) = 0$. This problem is quite different from most calculus problems. The products of positive and negative numbers should be approached carefully.\nWe will arbitrarily choose some easy values and let them be an integer. The values of $x$ are $0,1,2,3,-1,-2,-3$. \\boxed{E(0) = -45,\\ E(1) = -6} We have tried some of the above values of $x$ and we were not successful in solving $E(x) = 0$. We can also check by mind or eyeball. It would help with identification of the root. For a better solution: $E(-1) = 35 - \\sqrt{1} - 6 \\sqrt{1} = 20$ That may be greater than 35. It is clear that the following limit cannot be found. Therefore, we exclude $x = -1$.\nWe can use question analysis and continue to try out some difficult values until we find the first correct value of $x$. \\boxed{E(-2) = -9 - 12 = -21} Just try it, and it is too small.\n$$E(-3) = -9 - 18 = -27$$ Unfortunately, it still does not work. \\boxed{E(-4) = ",

Final Answer: The final answer is x=9. I hope it is correct. Solve for $x$. To start, we want to get all terms associated with $x$ on one side of the equation and all other terms on the other side. After doing this step, we get $$x \\sqrt{x} - 5x - 9 \\sqrt{x} = 35 \\Rightarrow \\sqrt{x} - 5 - 9 = \\frac{35}{x}.$$ Next, we want to isolate the radical term. Multiplying by $x$, we get $$x \\sqrt{x} - 5x - 9 \\sqrt{x} = 35 \\Rightarrow x \\sqrt{x} = 35 + 9x + 5x.$$ Squaring both sides of the equation gives $$x^2 \\sqrt{x} = (35 + 9x + 5x)^2.$$ Simplifying the right hand side of the equation, we have $$x^2 \\sqrt{x} = 1296 + 144x + 81x + 225x = 1296 + 450x.$$ Now that we have expressed each side of the equation as a product of a number and a final radical term, we know that each side must equal 0 and that $x$ cannot be 0 since the problem states that $x$ is an integer. Therefore, $$x^2 \\sqrt{x} = 0 = 1296 + 450x \\Rightarrow x^2 \\sqrt{x} = 0 = 1296 + 450x \\Rightarrow x^2 = \\frac{1296}{x \\sqrt{x}} = 0 = 1296 + 450x \\Rightarrow x \\sqrt{x} = \\frac{1296}{x^2} = 0 = 1296 + 450x \\Rightarrow \\frac{1296}{x^2} = 0 \\Rightarrow 1296 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 0 \\text{ is impossible }.$$ Therefore, the equation is reduced to $$x^2 ( \\sqrt{x} ) = 1296 + 450x.$$ Note that $",
