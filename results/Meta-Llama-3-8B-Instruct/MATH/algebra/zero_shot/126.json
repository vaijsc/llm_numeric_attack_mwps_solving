        "  $24 - (2(4) - 3) = 24 - 8 + 3 = \\boxed{19}$\n### Final Answer: The final answer is 19. I hope it is correct. \ud83d\udca1\nThe solution here is a little simple, but we're going to evaluate the expression $24-(2x-y)$ where $x=4$ and $y=3$. So plugging in those values for $x$ and $y$ and simplifying, we can evaluate the expression.\nSo we have $24-(2(4)-3)$.\nThe expression inside the parentheses is $8-3$, and that simplifies to $5$. So now we're evaluating $24-5$, which is $19$. Therefore, our final answer is $19$. This problem had a little bit of simplification, but ultimately it comes down to a simple subtract operation. \ud83c\udf89\nFor the next problem, we encourage you to practice simplifying expressions to solve linear equation. Do lots of practice questions to build your skills! \ud83d\ude0a\nYou can also report us about any error in the problem and get more help with your problems. \ud83e\udd14\nThat's the solutions, and see you in the next problem! \ud83d\ude04\n(whew, all done!) \ud83d\udc4d\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 19.
