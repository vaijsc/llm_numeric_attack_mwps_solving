        "To find the smallest value of the expression \\( x^2 - 6x + 13 \\), we will first rewrite the expression in a standard form by completing the square.\n1. We start with the expression:\n   \\[\n   x^2 - 6x + 13\n   \\]\n2. To complete the square for the quadratic part \\( x^2 - 6x \\), we need to find the term that will make it a perfect square trinomial. We take half of the coefficient of \\( x \\) (which is -6), square it, and add and subtract that term:\n   \\[\n   \\left( \\frac{-6}{2} \\right)^2 = (-3)^2 = 9\n   \\]\n3. We rewrite the expression by adding and subtracting 9:\n   \\[\n   x^2 - 6x + 9 + 4 = (x - 3)^2 + 4\n   \\]\n4. Now, the expression \\( x^2 - 6x + 13 \\) can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   (x - 3)^2 + 4\n   \\]\n5. The term \\( (x - 3)^2 \\) is a perfect square and is always non-negative (i.e., \\( (x - 3)^2 \\geq 0 \\)). Thus, the smallest value occurs when \\( (x - 3)^2 = 0 \\), which happens when \\( x - 3 = 0 \\) or \\( x = 3 \\).\n6. Substituting \\( x = 3 \\) back into the expression gives us:\n   \\[\n   (3 - 3)^2 + 4 = 0 + 4 = 4\n   \\]\nTherefore, the smallest value of the expression \\( x^2 - 6x + 13 \\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{4}\n\\]",
        "To find the smallest value of the expression \\( x^2 - 6x + 13 \\) where \\( x \\) is an integer, we can start by rewriting the expression into a different form.\nWe can complete the square for the quadratic expression:\n\\[\nx^2 - 6x + 13\n\\]\nThe first step is to take the coefficient of \\( x \\), which is \\(-6\\), halve it to get \\(-3\\), and then square it to get \\(9\\). We can then rewrite the expression as follows:\n\\[\nx^2 - 6x + 9 + 4 = (x - 3)^2 + 4\n\\]\nNow, our expression becomes:\n\\[\n(x - 3)^2 + 4\n\\]\nThe term \\( (x - 3)^2 \\) is a perfect square and its minimum value occurs when \\( x - 3 = 0 \\), or \\( x = 3 \\). In this case, the minimum value of \\( (x - 3)^2 \\) is \\( 0 \\).\nSubstituting \\( x = 3 \\) back into the expression gives us:\n\\[\n(3 - 3)^2 + 4 = 0 + 4 = 4\n\\]\nNow that we have determined the minimum value of the expression:\n\\[\nx^2 - 6x + 13 \\geq 4\n\\]\nTo confirm that 4 is indeed the smallest value the function can take when \\( x \\) is an integer, we validate by checking other integer values close to \\( x = 3 \\).\n1.

For \\( x = 4 \\):\n   \\[\n   4^2 - 6 \\cdot 4 + 13 = 16 - 24 + 13 = 5\n   \\]\nFrom our calculations:\n- At \\( x = 2 \\), the value is \\( 5 \\)\n- At \\( x = 3 \\), the value is \\( 4 \\)\n- At \\( x = 4 \\), the value is \\( 5 \\)\nSince the closest integer values give us a minimum value of \\( 4 \\) at \\( x = 3 \\), the lowest value of the expression \\( x^2 - 6x + 13 \\) when \\( x \\) is an integer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{4}\n\\]",

Since the coefficient of \\( x^2 \\) (which is \\( a \\)) is positive, the parabola opens upwards, meaning it has a minimum point.\nTo find the vertex of the parabola, which gives us the x-coordinate where the minimum occurs, we can use the formula:\n\\[\nx = -\\frac{b}{2a}.\n\\]\nSubstituting \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) into this formula:\n\\[\nx = -\\frac{-6}{2 \\cdot 1} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3.\n\\]\nNow we calculate \\( f(3) \\):\n\\[\nf(3) = 3^2 - 6 \\cdot 3 + 13.\n\\]\nCalculating each term:\n\\[\n3^2 = 9,\n\\]\n\\[\n-6 \\cdot 3 = -18,\n\\]\n\\[\nf(3) = 9 - 18 + 13 = 4.\n\\]\nNext, we need to verify if this is indeed the minimum value for integer values of \\( x \\).

        " To find the smallest value, we must solve the equation $x^2 - 6x +13 = 0$ for $x$. We can factor it by observing $x^2 - 6x +13 = (x-1)(x-13)$ by observing $-6 = -1 - 13$. The factorisation should appear linearly. Thus, $$x^2-6x+13=(x-1)(x-13) = 0$$ which means either $x-1=0$ or $x-13=0$. If we add 1 to each of these, we have $x=1+1=2$ or $x=13+1=14$. However, $x$ is an integer so the first possibility satisfies. Therefore, when $x=2$, the expression $x^2 - 6x +13$ attains the smallest value of $\\boxed{3}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 3.

In our case, the expression is $x^2-6x+13$, and to find the minimum of this, we need to find the value of $x$.
