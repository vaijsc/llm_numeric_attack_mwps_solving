The distance between the center of a circle with the equation ( x 2 + y 2 = 6 x - 8 y + 24) center of the circle and the point (-3,-12). So let's start with the given equation x 2 + y 2 = 6 x - 8 y + 24 it is the equation of a circle. To find the center and the radius of the circle, we need to complete the square for both the x and y values. So we start with the x square and the y square, and then subtract and add the perfect square of x and y values. The result is the center of the circle with -3 and -4. We then use the Distance Formula, which is \u221a(x 2 - a 2 + y 2 - b 2), where a is the x-value of the center, b is the y-value of the center, x is the x-value of the point, and y is the y-value of the point. Substituting the given values we have: \u221a(3^2 -(-3)^2 + (-4)^2 - (-12)^2) = \u221a(9 + 9 + 16 + 144) = \u221a(178) We then approximate the value of \u221a",

I hope it is correct.  Thank you for your patience. \n### Tips and Variations: \n* When asked to simplify an expression, try to factorize or use the distribution-property to cancel out terms.\n* To convert an equation to standard form for a circle, try to complete the square on both variables.\nYou can also use the distance formula between two points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ by calculating\n\\begin{align*}\nd &= \\sqrt{(x_1-x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2}\\\\\n&= \\sqrt{(3-(-3))^2 + (-4 - (-12))^2}\\\\\n&= \\sqrt{6^2 + (-8)^2}\\\\\n&= \\sqrt{36 + 64}\\\\\n",
        "  F www.TODO.LIVE\nFirst, we condition the given equation to find the center of the circle. Writing it as $\\displaystyle (x-3)^2 + (y+4)^2 = 3^2+4^2$ shows that the circle has its center at $(3,-4)$.\nDistance from the circle\u2019s center $(3,-4)$ to the point $(-3,-12)$ is $\\displaystyle \\sqrt{(3-(-3))^2+(-4-(-12))^2} =\\sqrt{36+64} = \\sqrt{100} = \\boxed{10}$ units.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 10. I hope it is correct. You are responsible for your mistakes. I suggest you to practice this question several times without any help. Then you will be able to solve this type of questions easily. Sometimes, you need to use your logic and make a simple solution to the problem. This is the key to success in math. You should not use any programming or computational method to solve this type of questions without permission. ALWAYS ask your instructor for permission before using any programming or computation method. He/she may not allow it. You are responsible for your solution.",
        " \nThe center of the circle is given by the intersection of the lines $\\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 0$ and $\\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 0$, where $f(x,y) = x^2+y^2-6x+8y-24 = (x-3)^2 + (y+4)^2 - 25$, so that the center is the point $(3,-4)$. The distance between the center $(3,-4)$ and $(-3,-12)$ is given by $\\sqrt{(3-(-3))^2 + (-4-(-12))^2} = \\sqrt{36+64} = \\sqrt{100} = \\boxed{10}$.",
        "  The distance between the two points $(-3,-12)$ and $(\\Bar{x},\\Bar{y})$ must satisfy: \\begin{eqnarray} \\sqrt{(x_1-x_2)^2+(y_1-y_2)^2}=\\sqrt{(\\Bar{x}+3)^2+(-\\Bar{y}-12)^2}.\\tag{1} \\end{eqnarray}\nLet us first identify the center of the circle. Here it is given by the equation\\begin{eqnarray} x^2+y^2=6x-8y+24.\\tag{2} \\end{eqnarray}\nCompleting the squares, we get the center of the circle: \\begin{eqnarray}\n(x-3)^2+(y+4)^2&=&3^2+(-4)^2+24\\\\\n&=&25\n\\end{eqnarray}\nSo the center is $\\boxed{(3,-4)}$.\n Now we can use (1) to find the required distance: \\begin{eqnarray}\n\\sqrt{(3+3)^2+(-4-12)^2}&=&\\sqrt{6^2+16^2}\\\\\n&=&\\sqrt{36+256}\\\\\n&=&\\boxed{\\sqrt{292}}\\\\\n&\\approx&17.05\n\\end{eqnarray}\nWe have the final answer $\\sqrt{292}$.
