        "To solve this problem, we need to find the sum of the sums of all two-element subsets of the set \\(\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\).\nFirst, let's determine the two-element subsets of the set:\nThe set \\(\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\) has \\(6\\) elements. The number of two-element subsets (combinations) can be calculated using the formula:\n\\[\n\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\n\\]\nwhere \\(n\\) is the total number of elements in the set, and \\(k\\) is the size of the subset.

Specifically, each number \\(x \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\) appears in a combination with each of the other \\(5\\) numbers. Therefore, each number appears in \\(5\\) different two-element subsets.\nConsequently, the contribution of each number \\(x\\) to the total sum of sums is \\(5x\\).\nNow, let's compute the sum of the numbers in the set:\n\\[\n1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21\n\\]\nNow, we can find the contribution of all numbers combined:\n\\[\n\\text{Total Contribution} = 5 \\times (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6) = 5 \\times 21 = 105\n\\]\nSo, the sum of the sums of the elements of all the two-element subsets is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{105}\n\\]",

Recall that the formula to find the sum of any two pairs of the numbers is given by the following equation:\n Pairsum\u00a0=\u00a0a1+a2\n### Example:\nWe have a set system with numbers like $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$. Create sets such as $\\{1,7\\}$, $\\{2,8\\}$,$\\$ \\{3,9\\}, \\$ $\\{4,10\\} ,\u2026 when the input is\u00a0$\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$. But, there are not 9 enough numbers, so we can not explain this.

        " To compute the sum of such subsets, we have to find out the sums of the 15 subsets. For method I, first we need to see that the sum of subset is symmetric about $3$. i.e., $\\{1,2\\}$ | $\\{1+2,3\\}$ = $\\{1,4\\}$ | $\\{1+4,3\\}=\\{2,4\\}$ | $\\{2+4,3\\}$ = $\\{3,4\\}$ | $\\{3+4,3\\}$. (This symmetry allows us to count 7 subsets , the other subsets are $\\{{1,3}\\}$ $\\{{1,5}\\}$ $\\{{1,6}\\}$ $\\{{2,5}\\}$ $\\{{2,6}\\}$ $\\{{5,6}\\}$).\n### Method I:\nFrom above symmetry we know that the numbers of subset are 7.  To find out the sum of these subsets: $\\{1,2\\}$ | $1+2=3$, $\\{1,4\\}$ | $1+4=5$, $\\{2,4\\}$ | $2+4=6$, $\\{3,4\\}$ | $3+4=7$ $\\{1,3\\}$ | $1+3=4$, $\\{1,5\\}$ | $1+5=6$, $\\{1,6\\}$ | $1+6=7$, $\\{2,5\\}$ | $2+5=7$, $\\{2,6\\}$ | $2+6=8$, $\\{5,6\\}$ | $5+6=11$. The sum is: 3+5+6+7+4+6+7+7+8+11 = 64.\n### Method II: Another way is to count the sum of such subsets. $6\\choose 2$= 15 subsets of two element. Each subset contains one element from set {1,2} and the other from {3,4} or {3,5} or {3,6} or {4,5} or {4,6} or {5,6}.\nEach subsets contains the elements that are sum to $\\{a, b\\}$ then we have $a+b$. \nThe method is same for {3,4} , {3,5} , {3,6} , {4,5}",

Clearly, every element of S appears in exactly 5 of the 2-element subsets. Since there are only 6 elements, there is a pigeonhole that appears in at least 2 of the 2-element subsets.

        " 15 solutions.\n\u2022 So, there are $15$ subsets as required. But for each subset we have a sum of two and for $15$ elements the sum adds to $15$ times that sum.\n\u2022 But for each set, there is a pair say $(a,b)$, the sum of which is $a+b$ or maybe $a+b$ is $1+b$ when $a$ is $1$.\n\u2022 So in the end, we have to find the sum of $(1+2) + (1+3) + (1+4) + (1+5) + (1+6) + (2+3) + (2+4) + (2+5) + (2+6) + (3+4) + (3+5) + (3+6) + (4+5) + (4+6) + (5+6)$. That is a pretty long sum. So, we can break it down further. This can be written as $(3+3+3+3+3+4+4+4+4+5+5+5+6+6+6)$.\n\u2022 Thus, we need to find $(3+3+3+3) + (4+4+4) + (5+5+5) + (6+6+6)$. That is or $3\\cdot 4 + 4\\cdot 3 + 5\\cdot 3 + 6\\cdot 3$. So in the end we can evaluate the value which we find by calculating out $4\\cdot 3 = 12, 3\\cdot 4 = 12, 3\\cdot 5 = 15, 3\\cdot 6 = 18$.\n\u2022 Now add all of the values like 12 + 12 + 15 + 18 = 57.",
        " John first, Oh, lets start... so first we  get a list of two-element subsets of $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$.  You, Rohan?",
        " A possible solution.\nTo compute the sum of each two-element subset, take one element from $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$ and choose a second element from the remaining elements. Then the sum is added to $1$, and next, we move to the next unchosen element and find the sum. Finally, we will get $\\frac{6\\cdot 5}{2}=15$ of them.\nTherefore, let\u2019s see. If we start with 1, then the first subset will have elements 1, and 2. Then, the second one will have the elements 1 and 3. The next two after that will have 1, and 4, and 1, and 5, and then 1, and 6.\nNext, we have to find the subsets with elements starting with 2. So the first one will be elements 2 and 3. The second will be 2 and 4. The next two will be 2, and 5, and 2, and 6.\nThe subsets with elements starting from 3 are 3, and 4, 3, and 5, and 3, and 6.\nNext, we will have elements 4, and 5, and then 4, and 6, and, finally, we will have 5, and 6.\nSo here are all the possible sums. Now, let\u2019s see.\nThe first value will be $1+2=3$, so $1+3=4$ will be the second sum. Next, $1+4=5$, $1+5=6$, $1+6=7$.\nFor the subset with elements starting with 2, the next two are 2+3=5 and 2+4=6. Then, 2+5=8 and 2+6=9.\nNext, the subsets with elements starting with 3, and then the subsets with elements starting with 4, and then the subsets with elements starting with 5.\nNotice that all of these are within the first 10 elements. In this case, the tenth value will be $5+6=11$.\nAnd then we will repeat because now the first subset with elements starting from 6 will start a new sequence.\nThis is $6+7=13$, $6+8=14$, $6+9=15$, and finally, $6+10=16",
        " \n#### Step 1: Calculate all possible two-element subsets of $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$.\nThese are shown here: \\begin{align*}\n&\\{\\{1,2\\}, \\{1,3\\}, \\{1,4\\}, \\{1,5\\}, \\{1,6\\}, \\\\\n&\\{2,3\\}, \\{2,4\\}, \\{2,5\\}, \\{2,6\\}, \\\\\n&\\{3,4\\}, \\{3,5\\}, \\{3,6\\}, \\\\\n&\\{4,5\\}, \\{4,6\\}, \\\\\n&\\{5,6\\}\\} & \\text{The set of 2-element subsets}\n\\end{align*}\n#### Step 2: Calculate the sum of elements for each subset.\nThese can be calculated directly from the set of elements: \\begin{align*}\n& \\{1,2\\}: 3, \\\\\n& \\{1,3\\}: 4, \\\\\n& \\{1,4\\}: 5, \\\\\n& \\{1,5\\}: 6, \\\\\n& \\{1,6\\}: 7, \\\\\n& \\{2,3\\}: 5, \\\\\n& \\{2,4\\}: 6, \\\\\n& \\{2,5\\}: 7, \\\\\n& \\{2,6\\}: 8, \\\\\n& \\{3,4\\}: 7, \\\\\n& \\{3,5\\}: 8, \\\\\n& \\{3,6\\}: 9, \\\\\n& \\{4,5\\}: 9, \\\\\n& \\{4,6\\}: 10, \\\\\n& \\{5,6\\}: 11\n\\end{align*}\n#### Step 3: Calculate the sum of these sums.\nNow we can add all these sums together: \\begin{align*}\n& 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 9 + 10 + 11 = 90\n\\end{align*}\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 90. I hope it is correct.  You must calculate the sum of all elements, then determine all possible combinations of 2 elements, for 6 element",
        " \nLet\u2019s first calculate the elements of each of the 15 two-element subsets of $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$.\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\{\\{1,2\\},\\{1,3\\},\\{1,4\\},\\{1,5\\},\\{1,6\\},\\\\\n&\\{2,3\\},\\{2,4\\},\\{2,5\\},\\{2,6\\},\\\\\n&\\{3,4\\},\\{3,5\\},\\{3,6\\},\\\\\n&\\{4,5\\},\\{4,6\\},\\{5,6\\}\\}\n\\end{align*}\nThen we can find the sums of each of these subsets. The sum of a pair is always equal to the sum of some elements of $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$.\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\{1,2\\} \\rightarrow 3,\\\\\n&\\{1,3\\} \\rightarrow 4,\\\\\n&\\{1,4\\} \\rightarrow 5,\\\\\n&\\{1,5\\} \\rightarrow 6,\\\\\n&\\{1,6\\} \\rightarrow 7,\\\\\n&\\{2,3\\} \\rightarrow 5,\\\\\n&\\{2,4\\} \\rightarrow 6,\\\\\n&\\{2,5\\} \\rightarrow 7,\\\\\n&\\{2,6\\} \\rightarrow 8,\\\\\n&\\{3,4\\} \\rightarrow 7,\\\\\n&\\{3,5\\} \\rightarrow 8,\\\\\n&\\{3,6\\} \\rightarrow 9,\\\\\n&\\{4,5\\} \\rightarrow 11,\\\\\n&\\{4,6\\} \\rightarrow 12,\\\\\n&\\{5,6\\} \\rightarrow 13.\n\\end{align*}\nSo the sum of these 15 sums is\n$$3+4+5+6+7+5+6+7+8+7+8+9+11+12+13=96.$$\nSo the answer is $\\boxed{96}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 96.

        " \nWe need to figure out what the two-element subsets are and what are the elements within.
