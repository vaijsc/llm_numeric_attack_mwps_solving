    "solution": "We first note that the $5^x$ term grows much faster than the other two terms. Indeed, for $n\\geq2$, $5^x \\geq 5(2^x + 1^x)$. Consequently, we focus on that term. The first four powers of $5$ are $5^1=5, 5^2=25, 5^3=125,$ and $5^4=625$. The last of these is close to $642$ so we check $x=4$ and get that $1^x+2^x+5^x = 1 + 16 + 625 = 642$, as desired, so $x=\\boxed{4}$.",

If you don't take a small pause and think, you will miss that step!\nPlease share and try the question with the following solution:\nSTEP 1: First, I noticed that when $x = 1$, $1^1 + 2^1 + 5^1 = 1 + 2 + 5 = 8 < 642$. This means, we cannot have $x = 1$.\nSTEP 2: Next, I fixed $x$ at 2, 3 and so on...When $x = 2$, $1^2 + 2^2 + 5^2 = 1 + 4 + 25 = 30 < 642$. When $x = 3$, $1^3 + 2^3 + 5^3 = 1 + 8 + 125 = 134 < 642$. This way, we have tested a lot of $x$ and $1^x + 2^x + 5^x$ all the time less than 642. We can see that for sure $1^x + 2^x + 5^x < 642$ for $x < 3$. \nSTEP 3: Now, we know that $1^x + 2^x + 5^x < 642$ for $x < 3$ and $1^x + 2^x + 5^x = 642$ for $x = 5$. So, we can conclude that the value of $x$ is $\\boxed{5}$!\nThis question shows us how important it is to test numbers. Without the STEP 2 part, we would be totally lost! ",
        "\u00a0 If $x$ is a positive integer such that $1^x + 2^x + 5^x = 642$, what is the value of $x$?\nAs it is given that $1^x + 2^x + 5^x = 642$, we can consider them one by one. We have $1^x = 1$.\nWe can notice that $2^x$ will be even for any positive integer $x$. Also, $5^x$ is odd for any positive integer $x$.\nTherefore, $642$ is not even, so $2^x$ cannot be $642$.\nIf $x = 2$, then $1^x + 2^x + 5^x = 1 + 4 + 25 = 30$. If $x = 3$, then $1^x + 2^x + 5^x = 1 + 8 + 125 = 134$. If $x = 4$, then $1^x + 2^x + 5^x = 1 + 16 + 625 = 642$.\nSo, in this case, the value of $x$ is $\\boxed{4}$.

So, $(a+b+c)^2 = (a+b+c)(a+b+c)$. Checking each term in the binomials, we get:\n(2^x)^2 = 4^x\n4^x = a^2\n(5^x)^2 = 5^{2x}\n25^{x} = c^2\n(2^x)^2 = (4^x)^2\n2 = 2 \\cdot 4^x\n4^x = 2\nFrom this, we get the final expression: $(2^x+4^x+5^x)$ = $(2 + 4^x + 5^x)$ = $\\boxed{(2+4^x+25^x)}$.\n### Step 2: Factorize.\nAs $\\boxed{(2+4^x+25^x)}$, we get $0 = (1^x+2^x+5^x)-(1^x+2^x+25^x)$ = $(642-642)$ = $0$.\nFrom $642$\u2019s $1$ and $2$ digits, we know that we are dealing with $= 6$, which should be taken care of by one factor, and $42$, which should be taken care of by one power of $2$ and one power of two other digits.

        " I think the only thing wrong with this question is the statement after the prompt. It does nothing to help with solving the problem and may actually confuse the student into thinking they should need it. I agree with the student that 1, 2, and 5 are relatively close to each other, but I don't see how that has any relevance to solving the problem.\nYou can also use polynomial identities or look up that $1^n + 2^n + 3^n$ is divisble by $n^2$ if $n>2$ (for $n=3$ this gives $1+2+8=11$ which is not divisible by 9, which is not helpful for our problem, but for all other $n>2$ it works and thus 642 is the remainder for some $n$, which is too large a number to check).\nSo, I think it is safe to just brute force the result: $1^1+2^1+5^1 = 8$, $1^2+2^2+5^2 = 42$, $1^3+2^3+5^3 = 188$, $1^4+2^4+5^4 = 494$, $1^5 + 2^5 + 5^5$ is not too difficult a calculation, but since $1^5+2^5+8^5$ is just 20 ahead of it, it\u2019s no surprise that $6^5+8^5$ is inbetween 494 and 642. Therefore, since $1^5+2^5+5^5$ has 5-kubectl as a remainder, $1^5+2^5+8^5$ also must have 5 as the remainder, so $1^6+2^6+5^6$ is a multiple of 242, but since $1^4+2^4+5^4$ already has 494 as a remainder, $1^4+2^4+5^4+2^3+2^2+2$ must have 242 as the remainder, which in turn says that $1^6+2^6+5^6$ has 0 as the remainder.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 6. I hope it is correct. Therefore $1^5 + 2^5 + 5^5$ is the remainder for a positive integer $x",
        " Since we are solving a polynomial equal to 642, it is a Diophantine equation. Diophantine equations have the general form $$Ax + By = C,$$ where $A$, $B$, and $C$ are integers, and $x$ and $y$ are variables that are also integers. In this case, we have $$1^x + 2^x + 5^x = 642.$$ We can factor out 5 to get $$5^x + 1^x + 2^x = 642$$ To solve this equation, we can look at the form $$Ax + Bx + Cx = 642$$ This is a quadratic Diophantine equation, which is a bit complicated. In order to solve this, we would need to have the prime factorization of 642. We factor 642 into 2*3*107, which allows us to rearrange the left hand side of the equation into $$(5x+1) + (2x) + (107)^0 = 642$$\nThis is a linear Diophantine equation, which we know how to solve. Now we have $$(5x+1) + (2x) = 642-107=535$$ Distributing we get $$7x + 1 = 535$$ If we subtract 1 from both sides, we have $$7x = 534$$ Now we can divide both sides by 7 to get $$x = 76$$ Therefore, the value of $x$ is $\\boxed{76}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 76.

        " The sum of three terms has a large value, but their exponents aren\u2019t that big. So maybe $1^x + 2^x$ could be big while $5^x$ is somewhat smaller. Let\u2019s try some integers for $x$. For example, if $x=3$, then we get $1^3+2^3+5^3 = 1+8+125=134>642$, so $x<3$. If $x=2$, then we get $1^2+2^2+5^2=1+4+25=30<642$, so $x>2$. Now $x=2$ gives $1+4+25=30>642$. However, $x=1$ gives $1+2+5=8<642$, so $x=2$ is the last possibility. Since $1^2 + 2^2 + 5^2 = 42$, and $1,2,5,6,10<42$ are all nonnegative integers, we can\u2019t find a smaller sum with two terms.
