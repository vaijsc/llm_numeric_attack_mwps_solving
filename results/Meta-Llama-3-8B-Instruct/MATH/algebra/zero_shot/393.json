        " Our goal is to find the numbers $c$ and $d$ such that $r^2+10r+25=(r+c)(r+d)$. Expanding the right side, we find that\n$$(r+c)(r+d)=r^2+(c+d)r+cd.$$Now, we want this to be equal to $r^2+10r+25$. Therefore, by comparing coefficients, we should have $c+d=10$ and $cd=25$. Note that $(c+d)^2=c^2+2cd+d^2$, so we know that $c^2+2cd+d^2=100$. Meanwhile, we know that $cd=25$, and plugging this in to the identity above, we get $c^2+50+d^2=100$, implying that $c^2+d^2=50$. This means that $(c+d)^2=(c^2+d^2)+2cd=150$. Now, we know that $c+d=10$, so we can plug this in to this last expression to get $100=150$. Therefore, there is only one solution to the system of equations above, and we can solve it by solving equations that way. Solving $(c+d)^2=(100)$, we find that $c+d=10$, where $c=5-d$. Plugging this in to the other equation $cd=25$, and simplifying, we get $(5-d)d=25$, or $5d-d^2=25$, or $d^2-d-25=0$. We can use the quadratic formula to solve for $d$, and plugging it in to $c+d=10$, we can find $c$, and our answer is $\\boxed{(r+5)(r+5)=r^2+10r+25}$. Technically, there is another solution, namely $c-d=5$, which would give us $c+d=10$. Similarly, we can plug this in to $cd=25$ to get $(c-d)c=25$, or $c^2-c-25=0$. We can solve this to find $c$, and using $c+d=10$, we find $d$, and we get $\\boxed{(r-5)(r+5)=r^2+10r+25}$. I hope this helps! @FilipeBarreiros: Yes, we can and we should take the other solution,",
