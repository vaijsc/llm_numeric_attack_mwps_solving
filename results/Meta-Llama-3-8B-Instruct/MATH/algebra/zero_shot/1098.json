If we call the smallest term as 'a' and the largest term as 'b', we can write the difference between the terms as 'b-a=14'.\nTo find the smallest term, we can say that 'a' is equal to some number. Let's say 'n'. So, the arithmetic sequence can be written as 'n, n+d, n+2d'\nNow, we know that the difference between the largest and smallest terms is 14. So, 'n+2d -n =14', which means 'd = 7'.\nNow, we know the smallest term 'a' and the difference 'd' is 7, we can write the sequence as 'n, n+7, n+14'.\nNow, we are told that we need to add half of the smallest term to each number.\nSo, the sequence becomes 'n, n+7, n+14'\nAnd half of the smallest term is 0.5n\nSo, now the sequence becomes 'n+0.5n, n+7+0.5n, n+14+0.5n'\nOr in other words, '1.5n, 7.5n, 14.5n'\nThe sum of the resulting terms should be 120.

Adding the number together and subtracting 27 from both sides, we get d = 87. Now we know what the difference between consecutive terms is.\nFrom before, we know that the smallest term is a1.

        " The key to solving this problem is understanding how the terms of an arithmetic sequence are related.\nLet the original terms be, $x, x+d$ and $x+2d$.\nTheir difference is 14. Thus, $(x+2d) - x = 14$, or $d = 7$.\nThe second key point is understanding how adding half of the term affects the terms.\nHalf of the smallest term is added to each term, so we get $x + \\frac{x}{2}, (x+d) + \\frac{(x+d)}{2}, (x+2d) + \\frac{(x+2d)}{2}$.\nNow we need to make sure the sum of these three new terms is 120.\n$([x + \\frac{x}{2}]) + [(x+d) + \\frac{(x+d)}{2}]+ [(x+2d) + \\frac{(x+2d)}{2}]) = 120$\nCombining like terms and simplifying yields\n$\\frac{5x}{2}+3d = 120$.\nNow we substitute $x+d = 14$, or $d = 7$, and we get\n$\\frac{5x}{2} + 21 = 120$.\nSubtracting 21 from both sides gives\n$\\frac{5x}{2} = 99$.\nDividing both sides by 5/2 and multiplying by 2 yields\n$x = 39$.\nThus, the original smallest term is 39. $\\boxed{39}$.   # 1969AMC\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 39.

        " Let the three consecutive terms be a-6, a-5, and a-4.\nAfter half of the smallest term is added to each term, we get a-3, a-2, and a-1. The sum of these three numbers is 120. Therefore, we have:\na-3 + a-2 + a-1 = 120\na-6, a-5, and a-4 were the original sequence, so we have:\n(a-6) - 1 + (a-6) - 2 + (a-6) - 3 = 120\n3a-11 = 120\n3a-11 + 11 = 120 + 11\n3a = 131\n3a/3 = 131/3\na = 43\nSo the original smallest term is 43-6 = 37, which is the correct answer.\ud83c\udf89\nCode: In[1]:= ClearAll[a];\nLet's think step by step.\nOut[2]= 43\nOut[3]= 37\n### Related: What is the common difference between the three terms in an arithmetic sequence if the first term is 5 and the common ratio is 2? Here the first term of the arithmetic sequence is 5. So we have:\nar = 5r\nar + d = 5r + d\nar + 2d = 5r + 2d\nHere, r = 2. So we have to find d, which is the common difference. Also, the second term is 10, so we have ar = 5r and ar + d = 10. It seems that we have to solve this system of linear equations for d. Now we return back to the equations, and we have to find the value of d. So let's solve the system.\na + d = 10\n5r + d = 10\nSubtracting a from both sides, we get d = 10 - a. Substituting this value of d in one of the equations, we get:\na + (10 - a) = 10\na + 10 - a = 10\n10 = 10\n(Notice how the left-hand side simplifies.)\nWe also have:\na + d = 10\na + (10 - a) = 10\na + 10 - a = 10\n10 = 10 again.\nThis seems a bit",

        " We know that the three consecutive terms are different by 14, so if we let the first term be $a$ , the second term is $a + 14$ , and the third term is $a + 28$ . We also know that half of the smallest term is added to each term, so we can say that $a / 2$ is added to $a$ , giving us $a + a / 2 = 3 a / 2$ , and we can say that $a / 2$ is added to $a + 14$ , giving us $a + 14 + a / 2 = 3 a / 2 + 14$ , and we can say that $a / 2$ is added to $a + 28$ , giving us $a + 28 + a / 2 = 3 a / 2 + 28$ .\nThe sum of the three resulting numbers is 120, so we can write the following equation:\n\\$\n\\begin{align*}\n3 a / 2 + 14 + 3 a / 2 & = 120 \\\\\n6 a / 2 + 14 & = 120 \\\\\n6 a / 2 & = 106 \\\\\na / 2 & = 53 / 3 \\\\\na & = 106 / 3 = 35 . 33 \\end{align*}\nSince $a$ cannot be a fraction, we know that it is an integer. This means that we can round down to $a = 35$ , which is the smallest number in the original sequence.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 35. I hope it is correct. ### Since the difference between the largest and smallest of the three consecutive terms in the arithmetic sequence is 14, the three terms are $a$ , $a + 14$ , and $a + 28$ . Half of the smallest term, i.e. $a / 2$ , is added to each term, giving us $a / 2 + a = 3 a / 2$ , $a / 2 + a + 14 = 3 a / 2 + 14$ , and $a / 2 + a + 28 = 3 a / 2 + 28$ . The sum of these three numbers is 120, so we can write the following equation: $$\\begin{align*}3a/2+14+3"
