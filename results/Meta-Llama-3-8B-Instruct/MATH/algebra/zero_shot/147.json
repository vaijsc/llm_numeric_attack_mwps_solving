Now we can apply the method for partial fraction decomposition and break this into $\\frac{A}{x-3}+\\frac{B}{x-5}.$ Now, to determine $A$ and $B$, we will create two equations. If we multiply each fraction by $(x-3)(x-5)$ and simplify, that gives $$4x = A(x-5)+B(x-3).$$ Then, we will plug in both values into this equation. When $x = 3$, the equation is $12 = A\\cdot 0 + B\\cdot (-2) => B = 6.$ When $x = 5$, we get $20 = A\\cdot 2 + B\\cdot 0 => A = 4.$ So, our final answer is $\\boxed{(A, B) = (4, 6)}.$\nEnjoy this solution only on the Mathematics Department of You and Me.\n## What is partial fraction decomposition?\nThe partial fraction decomposition of a rational function is a way of expressing the function as a sum of simpler fractions. In general, for a rational function \\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}, where P(x) and Q(x) are polynomials, we can write:\n\\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{a_i}{(x-c_i)} + R(x)\nwhere a_i and c_i are constants, and R(x) is a polynomial of degree less than the degree of Q(x).\nFor example, if we have:\n\\frac{x+2}{x^2+3x+2}\nWe can write:\n\\frac{x+2}{x^2+3x+2} = \\frac{A}{x+1} + \\frac{B}{x+2}\nThis can be verified by multiplying through by (x+1)(x+2) to get:\nx + 2 = A(x+2) + B(x+1)\nWe can then solve for A and B by substituting in different values of x. For example, when x = -1, we get:\n3 = 2A => A = 3/2\nWhen x = -2, we get:\n0 = 3/2 + B => B = -3/2\nSo, the partial fraction decomposition is:\n\\frac",

This means that for polynomial denominator $x^2-8x+15$, we set the variable $x$ to 3 to get a value of 0 for the top part. So, we solve.\n$4(3)/(3-3)^2-8(3)+15$ or 0/0-12+15 = 3",

To do this, we can multiply the original expression by the denominators of the two simpler fractions:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{4x}{x^2-8x+15}&=\\frac{A}{x-3}+\\frac{B}{x-5}\\\\\n4x&=A(x-5)+B(x-3)\\\\\n4x&=(A+B)x-5A-3B\n\\end{align*}To find $A$ and $B$, we can equate the coefficients of $x$ and the constants on both sides. The coefficient of $x$ on the left side is 4, the constant is 0, while on the right side, the coefficient of $x$ is $A+B$ and the constant is $-5A-3B$. Therefore, we have\n$$A+B=4\\qquad\\text{and}\\qquad -5A-3B=0.$$Using the first equation, we can express $A$ as\n$$A=4-B.$$Plugging this into the second equation gives\n$$20-8B-3B=0\\Rightarrow11B=20\\Rightarrow B=\\frac{20}{11}.$$\nThen\n$$A=4-B=4-\\frac{20}{11}=-\\frac{16}{11}.$$"
