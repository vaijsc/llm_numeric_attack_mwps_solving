        " Consider the smallest possible two-digit positive integer, $n = 10$.  Since the product of the two digits is $\\le n$, we must have $\\frac{n}{2} \\le 10$, so $n = 20.$ Now, we consider numbers of the form $n = 10a + b$, where the \u2018ones digit\u2019 $b$ and the \u2018tens digit\u2019 $a$ are not equal to zero.  Thus, the product of the digits is \\begin{align*}ab = n - \\frac{1}{2}(10a + b) = \\frac{1}{2}(10 - b).\\end{align*} Because $n$ is a two-digit number and $a \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, 9\\}$, we have $1 \\le a \\le 9.$ Since $n$ is the least possible positive integer to satisfy the condition, it\u2019s clear that $\\boxed{n = 18}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 18. I hope it is correct.\nSolution 2:\nLet the two digits be $d$ and $t$.  We must have that the product of the two digits is one-half of the integer.  Let $d$ be the ones digit and $t$ be the tens digit.  We can write $n = 10t + d$.  Since we want the two digits to multiply to one-half of the integer, we have $dt = \\frac{1}{2}(10t + d) \\Rightarrow dt = 5t + \\frac{d}{2}$.  Distributing the $5t$ to the right-hand side, we can combine like terms to obtain $dt - \\frac{5}{2}t = \\frac{d}{2} \\Rightarrow t(d - \\frac{5}{2}) = \\frac{d}{2}$.  Factoring out $\\frac{1}{2}$ gives $t(d - \\frac{5}{2}) = \\frac{1}{2}d$.  For this equation to be satisfied, we must have that the left-hand side is an integer, and that the right-hand side is an integer.  The left-hand side is always an integer because $t$ is an integer, and the right-hand side is always an integer because $d$ is an integer.  We take the left-hand side and try to factor it in a way",

However, if we increase the hundreds place to 11, we need to increase the tens place to 4 and the ones place to 9, since 1 * 4 * 9 = 36, which is greater than half of the integer.\n4 * 9 = 36 which is greater than half of 14.",

I hope it is correct. ===\n### Query:\u00a0 Is there a way to solve this problem with a little cleverness and insight, without having to brute force?\n### Answer:\nYes, there is a clever way to solve this problem without brute forcing. You can start by noticing that the product of two digits divided by the two-digit number equals $\\frac{1}{2}$ . This means that the product of two digits equals half the number. Therefore, you can rewrite the problem as:\nD1 \u00d7 D2 = 0.5N\nwhere N is the two-digit number.\nYou can now think of the problem as finding a number N, where N is a possible combination of the product D1 \u00d7 D2. The product can never be a perfect square, because that would mean that N is a perfect square, but the product should be half of N.\nYou can also notice that D1 \u00d7 D2 is less than 20 (because N is two digits). Therefore, you can have D1 = 1 and D2 = 2. However, you want the smallest number of two digits, so D1 must be greater than 1 and D2 must be less than 9.\nFormation of problem:\nLet D1 = 5, and D2 = 2.

The product of the digits for 10 is 1.\n### Solution:\nThe integer can be written as 10a + b where 0 < a < 10, and 0 < b < 10.\nFor the smallest two-digit positive integer, 0 < 10a + b < 100. So 10 < 10a + b < 100, which implies that a > 1.9. Thus, a \u2265 2.\nNext, 0 < b < 10, and a > 1.9, which implies that a < 10. So 1 \u2264 a \u2264 9. When a = 2, then 10a + b = 20 + b. Therefore, we see that the product of the digits is 20b, which is half an integer if 20b = 2k, where k is an integer. This only happens when 20b = 40, or b = 2. In this case, 20 + 2 = 22 is not a two-digit number, so it must be b = 1. This gives 20 + 1 = 21. But the question asks for a two-digit number. Moving on, when a = 3, then 10a + b = 30 + b. The product of the digits is 30b, which is half an integer if 30b = 30k. Then 30b = 15k, which implies that b = 1/2. Since b must be an integer, then b cannot = 1/2. Therefore, a \u2265 3.\nMoving on, when a = 4, then 10a + b = 40 + b. The product of the digits is 40b, which is half an integer if 40b = 20k. Then 40b = 10k, which implies that b = 1/2. Since b must be an integer, then b cannot = 1/2. Therefore, a \u2265 4.\nSo we only need to consider a \u2265 5. When a = 5, then 10a + b = 50 + b. The product of the digits is 50b, which is half an integer if 50b = 25k. Then 50b = 25k, which gives b = 1. Therefore, 10a + b = 51.\n",

I hope it is correct.  ### Step by Step Answer (Python): \nHere is how you can solve this problem using Python:\n```\nfor i in range(10,100):\n    if i % 10 != 0 and i // 10 * (i % 10) == i / 2:\n        print(i)\n        break\n```\n### Explanation: \nThe problem statement essentially asks to find the smallest two-digit positive integer where the product of its two digits is one-half of the integer. We can iterate through all two-digit positive integers and check whether this condition is met. To check, we first consider whether the integer has the same last digit as its tens digit (which can be done by the condition `i % 10 != 0`). If this condition is met, we then check whether the product of the two digits equals one-half of the integer (which can be done by the condition `i // 10 * (i % 10) == i / 2`). If both conditions are met, we print the integer and break the loop. This way, we can find the smallest such integer.  When you run this Python script, it will output `20` as the smallest two-digit positive integer such that the product of its two digits is one-half the integer.  ### Explanation from Khan Academy: \nYou can use the Khan Academy platform to learn about this topic. It is a well-structured educational platform where you can find lessons, videos, articles, and exercises to help you learn.

        " First, the two-digit positive integer has to have at least two digits. For example, 1, 2, and 3 are not adequate, nor are 11 or 12, because all of those will raise or reduce the product we are seeking. Second, as we read in your instructions, we need to assure that the product of the digits of the given number is a multiple of 2. We can only reach this by multiplying with 0.5. Finally, we must solve for the smallest integer. Let me investigate the appropriate ranges for this problem. Begining with a two digit number, the smallest is\u00a010. For the first digit of 10, the product of it with the second digit is (9 * x= 1/2 * 10) --> 9x = 5 --> x = 5/9; that portion will be 0.555... so it will never be 5/9. Still no joy. But then, our search will involve every other number. Now we need to try bigger numbers until we find the right answer.\nWe want our number to be the smallest integer possible. So we look for the smallest number where the product of the digits equals half the number. In other words, we look for the smallest two-digit number n, such that the product of its digits divided by 2 equals n. So i can test different two-digit numbers.\n1. 10: 0 * 1 = 0 (not one half of 10) > 10: 1 * 9 = 9 (not one half of 10) > 11: 1 * 1 = 1 (not one half of 11) > 12: 1 * 2 = 2 (not one half of 12) > 13: 1 * 3 = 3 (not one half of 13) > ...\nyou see. there are all 1 digit and less than 10.\nFinally, it took me 18 - 20 minutes. The answer is 16. Because you can calculate from the simple fact that multiply of the digits of the two-digit number will be the same, you know one-digit numbers, on Then find a number where the digits multiply zero.5 , what an expected multiplication.5, known as one-digit multiplication example\n### Correct Answer: The two-digit number is 16\nHere's why.

If $a = 4$, then $b = 2$. And if $a = 5$, then $b = 1$. So the smallest two-digit integer is $10a + b = 10(3) + 4 = 34$.\n### Common answer:\nThe smallest two-digit positive integer such that the product of its two digits is one-half the integer is $\\boxed{34}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 34.

Then 1/2 * 20 = 10 which is not a two-digit integer. Next try 1/2 * 30 = 15, this is close but too large. Then 1/2 * 40 = 20, this is still not a two-digit integer. 1/2 * 50 = 25 which is still too large.\nIt seems that we are stuck with 1/2 * 20 = 10, but we need a two-digit integer. As shown above, we are not lucky, so we need to think harder.\n### Connection:\nWe can think of a different way. When we think about 1/2 * 10, 1/2 * 20, 1/2 * 30, we are trying to solve 1 * x = 5, 1 * x = 10. These do not have much to do with the two-digit integers. We are not really clever.

If the two-digit number begins with a $2$, then the tens digit is either $2$ or $3$, but $2\\cdot3 = 6 < \\frac{x}{2}$, so it cannot be the case. Continuing in this way, we see that $x$ cannot start with a $1, 2, 3, 4,$ or $5$.\nIf the two-digit number begins with a $6$, then the tens digit is $7$, and we have $67$. If it begins with a $7$, then the tens digit is $8$, and we have $78$. Since $67 < 72$, and $72 > \\frac{x}{2}$, $x < 72$, which is not an integer. Therefore, $x$ must be $\\boxed{68}$.\nAlternatively, one can observe that the two-digit integer $18$ cannot be $x$. Continuing to increase, we find $19, 29, 39, 46, 56$, and we observe that $x = 68$ is the smallest two-digit integer such that the product of its two digits is an integer and less than $x/2$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 68.

This is the two-digit number where the product of two digits is the smallest two-digit positive integer.\nYour answer would be 68. Hope this helps you.\nYou can find it by starting from 1, because of the digit and so on.```python\n```python\nk = 9\nfor r in range(1, 10):\n    k += r\n    for nn in range(0, ",
