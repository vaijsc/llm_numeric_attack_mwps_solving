Dividing both sides of the first inequality by 1, we have $x^{4}+4x^{2}+4>0$, which is equivalent to $$(x^{2}+2)^{2}\\ge0.$$This inequality is always true.  We move on to the second inequality.  Let\u2019s divide both sides by 1 again, $x^{4}+4x^{2}<21$, which is equivalent to $$(x^{2}+2)^{2}-4<21.$$Rearranging the inequality, we have $$(x^{2}+2)^{2}<25.$$Taking the square root of both sides (note that every positive number has two square roots), we have $$\\lvert x^{2}+2\\rvert<5.$$The left side is the absolute value of $x^{2}+2$.  The absolute value of $x^{2}+2$ is the distance from the $x$-coordinate to the $x$-coordinate of the graph of $y=x^{2}+2$.   Let\u2019s consider different scenarios. $\\lvert x^{2}+2\\rvert<5$ is the same as saying $-5<x^{2}+2<5.$ Now, we subtract 2 from all the three parts in the inequality, $-7<x^{2}<3.$ Now, we know that $(x-1)(x+1)<0$.  Recall that $(x-1)(x+1)$ is less than 0 if one factor is less than 0 and the other factor is greater than 0.  As $x^{2}$ is not negative, the Product of the root of $(x-1)(x+1)$ product is greater than 0.  Hence one of the two roots must be positive, and the other root must be negative.  As the two roots must be less than 0 and greater than 0 respectively, we must have $x^{2}<1$.  We get $x>1$ or $x<-1.$  We take the minimum value $x$ from these two values.   The minimum value is $",
        " So first, $x^{4}+4x^{2}$ must be positive.  That means $x\\in \\mathbb{R} - \\{\\pm i\\sqrt{2}\\}$.  Now, for some reason I forgot why I forgot, we can consider $f(x)=x^{4}+4x^{2}-21$.\nf(x) = x^{4}+4x^{2}-21\nLet\u2019s find the 2 zeroes, $x_1 = -i\\sqrt{2}, x_2 = i\\sqrt{2}$. We should be just fine that there is no solution in $(-i\\sqrt{2}, i\\sqrt{2})$, because we know our function is positive here.\nf'(x) = 4x^{3}+8x = 4x(x^2+2)\nSo, $f(x)$ is increasing. Let us review the zeroes once more.  $x < -i\\sqrt[3]{2}$, $f(x)$ increases all the way up to $f(-i\\sqrt{2}) = -i\\sqrt{2}$. $f(i\\sqrt{2}) = i\\sqrt{2}$. $f(x)$ decreases from there.\nThis tells us our first point, $a = -i\\sqrt{2}$. $f(a) = -i\\sqrt{2}$ but our problem doesn\u2019t want that. $f(x)$ crosses the 21 line between $-i\\sqrt{2}$ and $i\\sqrt{2}$ but at $i\\sqrt{2}$. That means we have another point to solve. $x = i\\sqrt{2}$ is the only point of intersection with $y=21$.\nOur end points so far are $a = -i\\sqrt{2}$ and $b = i\\sqrt{2}$. In $\\mathbb{R}$, this is impossible. No points work. I think the issue here is with domain bounds.

        " \n$-4<x^{4}+4x^{2}<21$\nIf we write $x^4+4x^2$ as $(x^2)^2+4(x^2)$; then, with some algebraic manipulations, we find\n$x^4+4x^2 = (x^2+2)^2-4 = \\left(x^2+(\\sqrt{4})\\right)^2 - (\\sqrt{4})^2$.\nThis shows us that $x^4+4x^2$ represents a parabola (specifically, a circle) whose discriminate is negative, so the quadratic equation in $x^2$ has complex roots. In this problem, all values of $x$ are real, so we are essentially dealing with a curve whose certain part (from -2 to 2) lies over the real axis.\nNow, looking at the left hand side expression again (-4 < x^4+4x^2 < 21), we can isolate the rightmost part (xlim(21) < x) and derive:\nxlim(1) <= x.\nFurthermore, we must require that xlim(2) < x because for x>= 2 we have x^2+4x+4 > ylim.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is (-\\sqrt{3}, -2) U(2, \\sqrt{3}).

        " \nLet $f(x) = x^4+4x^2$.\nLet\u2019s consider the limits of $x$ that make $f(x)$ greater or equal to 21.  We know that $x=0$ is a critical point of $f(x)$, and that since $f(0) = 0$, the graph of $f(x)$ starts at $(0,0)$ and then turns over to firstly increase then decrease as $x$ moves to the right.\nNote that since $f(-\\infty) = -\\infty$ and $f(\\infty) = \\infty$, the graph will continue going up without bound as it approaches the far right of the number line; therefore, there is only one turn around point, which by the above is a point of $y$-coordinate 21.\nRecall that if $f(x) = x^4 + 4x^2$, then $f'(x) = 4x^3+8x = 4x(x^2+2)$, which has zero\u2019s at $x=0$ and $x=\\pm\\sqrt{2}$.  We see that $f''(x) = 12x^2 + 8$ and that $f''(0) > 0$, so $f$ is positive and concave up to the right of its local minimum, and then positive and concave down to the right of the turn around point.  Thus, the local minimum must be the point where $f''(x)=0$, and solving the equation $12x^2+8=0$ gives $x=\\pm\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$; note that both these values are between $x=0$ and the turning point, so there are no local minimums to the left of the turning point.\nFrom what we deduced above, we see that the turning point is a minimum, so it must be a maximum too (since the point just to the right of a maximum is always a minimum, and vice versa).  Therefore, the geometry of the function dictates that there is only one $x$-coordinate with $y$-coordinate 21, and that is $\\boxed{(\\pm\\sqrt{2},21)}$.\nNote that we see that this solution path is based upon the intermediate value theorem and the sign changes of $f''(x)$, and we could also check by plugging",

        " Interval notation\nWe know that $x^{4}$ is a fourth degree polynomial that can take on any value in $\\mathbb{R}$.\n### Explanation\nApplying the Intermediate Value Theorem to the function $f(x)=x^{4}$, the inequality $-4<f(x)<21$ means that there exists an $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x)=21$, but not such that $f(x)=-4$. Thus the left hand side of the inequality should be $-4$ and not $< -4$, so $-4\\leq x^{4}$.\nWe apply the Intermediate Value Theorem another time to the function $g(x)=-4x^{2}$ with the inequality $-4<g(x)<21$. This tells us that there exists an $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $g(x)=21$ but not such that $g(x)=-4$. Therefore the inequality has to be $g(x)\\geq -4$, so $x^{4}\\leq 4$, which implies $-2\\leq x^{2}$ since we know $x^{4}\\geq 0$.\nBut, since we also have to fulfill the equation $x^{4}+4x^{2}\\leq 21$, it also has to be true that $4x^{2}\\leq 21$, which is the same as $x^{2}\\leq 5.25$, so $-x^{2}\\geq -5.25$, which implies $f(x)\\geq -4$. Therefore, all the previous results combined give the answer $(\\boxed{-\\sqrt[2]{5.25},\\infty})$, this is since we know that $x>0$ is feasible, but the negative side is also.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is (-\\sqrt[2]{5.25},\\infty). I hope it is correct.

        " \u00a0The inequality is equivalent to $$\\begin{cases} x^{4}+4x^{2}<21 & \\text{(since $x^{4}+4x^{2}$ is always nonnegative)} \\\\ -4<x^{4}+4x^{2} & \\end{cases}$$It is easy to find the roots of $x^{4}+4x^{2}-21=0$. That is, we have (from Wolfram Alpha) $x^{4}+4x^{2}-21=(x^{2}+4)(x^{2}-3)=0$, so the solutions are $x=\\pm2$ and $x=\\pm \\sqrt{3}$. Then, $\\begin{cases} x^{4}+4x^{2}<21 & \\text{if $x\\notin\\{-\\sqrt{3},-2,0,2,\\sqrt{3}\\}$} \\\\ -4<x^{4}+4x^{2} & \\text{since we can also let $x=0$} \\end{cases}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is (-\\sqrt{3},-2)\\cup(0,2)\\cup(\\sqrt{3},\\infty).
