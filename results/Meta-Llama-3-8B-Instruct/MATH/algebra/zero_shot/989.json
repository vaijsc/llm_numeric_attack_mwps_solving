        " $\\boxed{\\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{3}}$\n1. Express $\\sqrt{3}$ as $b/a$ for some pair of integers $a$ and $b$. In other words, let $\\sqrt{3} = \\frac{b}{a}$. We can square both sides of this equation to find that $3 = b^2/a^2 \\implies b^2 = 3a^2$. Now, $b^2 = 9$ is a square number, so one possibility is $b=3$ and $a = 1$.\n2. Our expression now looks like this: $$\\frac{5}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{5}{\\frac{3}{1}}.$$This can be simplified: $$\\frac{5}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{5}{\\frac{3}{1}} = 5 \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\frac{3}{1}}.$$ This is where we see that multiplying by 1 in the form of $\\frac{a}{b}$ does not change the value of an expression. We are just manipulating the expression and multiplying the numerator and denominator by 1, so the value of the fraction does not change.\n3. Since the expression we want to simplify is now $$5 \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\frac{3}{1}},$$ we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $\\sqrt{3}$. Now, we know that $\\sqrt{3} = \\frac{b}{a}$ where $a = 1$ and $b=3$ but after some algebraic expression. Doing this multiplication yields: $$\\frac{5}{\\sqrt{3}} = 5 \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\frac{3}{1}} = 5 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}} = 5 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}.$$ Thus, the final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{3}}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{3}.
