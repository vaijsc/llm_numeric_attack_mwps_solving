This is important since a reflection leaves the vertex unchanged!\nStep 3: The new equation after reflection is $y- k = d(x-h)^2$, derived from the fact that the new parabola has the same vertex ($h,k$) and is reflected about the line $y=k$.\nExpanding $(x-h)^2$ and rearranging, we have $y = dx^2 - 2dhx + dh^2 + k$.\nStep 4: Now let's equate the given equation $y=ax^2+bx+c$ with the reflected equation $y=dx^2-2dhx+dh^2+k$. Since there's no $x^1$ term in $y=ax^2+bx+c$, we know that $b = 0$. Since there's no $x^0$ term in $y=dx^2-2dhx+dh^2+k$, we know that $d+c = 0$. Combining these, we have $d = -c$.\nEquating coefficients of $x^2$ ($a = d$), $x^1$ (both are $0$) and $x^0$ ($c = -d$), we get the two equations $a=d$ and $c = -d$.\nStep 5: By substituting $c = -d = -a$ into the sum $a+b+c+d+e+f$, we have $a+d+a+0+d+f = 2a-d+f = \\boxed{2a+f}$. However, since $a$ is the coefficient of $x^2$ in the original parabola and $f$ is the constant term, we can rewrite $2a+f = 2(a+k) + c = 2(a+k) + -a = 2k$.\nSo the answer is $\\boxed{2k}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer",

        " Let $p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$. Let $p$ have vertex $(h,k)$. Then, $p(x) - k = a(x-h)^2$ and so, $p(x)$ and $p(x) - k$ have the same vertex and the same vertex as the parabola $y = dx^2 + ex + f$. So, we may set them equal: $$ax^2 + bx + c - k = dx^2 + ex + f \\Leftrightarrow dx^2 + ex + f - c = (a - d)x^2 - bx + (k - c).$$Now, we equate the coefficients of each degree: $d = a$, $e = -b$, $f = k - c$.

As there are no numbers available to answer that question 0.2 ain\u2019t satisfied the calculation will end you have the full solution. Well, we do.\nSo we see that the expressions equal to $ax^2+bx+c$ and $dx^2+ex+f$ are identical and so their sum is to be subtracted. According to the proposition above, the initial sum may be estimated as follows: $a - d = a - 1 = -1, b - e = b - 1 = 0, c - f = c - 1 = 0$. So $a + b + c - d - e - f = -1$.\nWe will now summarize the solution.",
        " Let\u2019s first reflect the vertex $(h,k)$ about the line $y=k$ to get $(-h,k)$. So, this will be the vertex of the parabola with the equation $y=dx^2+ex+f$. We now need to find $d,e,f$, which will automatically give $a,b,c$.\nWe can do that by noting the vertex $(h,k)$ and the vertex $(-h,k)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, because they are reflections, and the vertex $(-h,k)$ has been transformed to the new parabola. Now, explicitly, we can use $(h,k)$ and $(-h,k)$ in the original parabola and in the new parabola to get the final answer.\n\\begin{align*} k&=ah^2+bh+c,\\\\ k&=d(-h)^2+e(-h)+f\\\\ &=dh^2-eh+f. \\end{align*}Setting the two equations equal to each other, we get that $ah^2+bh+c=dh^2-eh+f$.  We can split this up into three cases, depending on whether we take $h=0$, $h\\ne 0$, and $h\\ne 0$ as well.\nIf $h=0$, we get $c=k=0$ and $0+0+f=0$, so $f=0$, and $a+b+c=0$, or $d+e+f=0$, so our desired answer is $\\boxed{0}$.\nIf $h\\ne 0$, we can write $ah^2+bh+c=dh^2-eh+f$ as \\begin{align*} ah^2+bh+(c-f)&=dh^2-eh,\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad (a-d)h^2+(b+e)h+(c-f)&=0. \\end{align*} This must be true for all values of $h$, so the coefficients of $h^2$ and $h$ must be zero: \\begin{align*} a-d&=0,\\\\ b+e&=0. \\end{align*} So, we have $a=d$ and $b=-e$, which gives us $f=c-k$ and $d=a$, and so $a+b+c+d+e+f=a-a-e+e+c-k=k$.

This implies that $a=d$, $h=0$ and $k$ changes to $k+k=f+k$ which is $f=0$.\nSo, $a+b+c+d+e+f=0+a+b+c=0+h+k=\\boxed{0+k}$\noption C: 0+k\nlookat OptionC.png\nHowever, the above methods involves complex algebra and conjugate of $x$ and $y$, I also find it useful.

Thus, the parabola has equation $$y-k=a(x-h)^2,$$which becomes $y=ax^2-(2a)hx+a(h^2)+k.$ Equating coefficients, we find $a=a$, $-2ah=b$, $ah^2+c=k$, and $c=k$. Therefore, we can simplify $$y=ax^2-(2a)hx+a(h^2)+k=ax^2-2ahx+ah^2+k=ax^2+b(x-h)+k,$$and so $h$ represents the $x$-coordinate of the vertex. Since the parabola is reflected across the line $y=k$, we have that $f=k$.\nThe reflecting line goes through the midpoint of the parabola; in other words, the line goes through $(h,k)$. Thus, the line is the perpendicular bisector of the segment satisfying the equation $y=k$. Thus, since the line has a slope of $0$, we have that $e=0$.\nThe vertex of the reflected parabola is $(h,k)$ as well, so we have that $d=a$.

Since $a(x-h)^2+k$ is a squared expression it must be symmetric with respect to the $y$-axis, therefore $d(x^2-2hx)$ must also be symmetric with respect to the $y$-axis, hence $d$ must equal $a$. Looking at the $y$-coordinate of $h$, or $k$, we see that it must be equal for the reflected parabola as well. So the equation for the reflected parabola must be $y=ax^2-2ahx+ah^2+k=ax^2-2ax(x-h)+k$.

The parabola $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ and vertex $(h, k)$ is reflected about the line $y = k$. This results in the parabola with equation $y = dx^2 + ex + f$. In terms of $k$, what is the value of $a + b + c + d + e + f$? </p> <p>We first determine the reflection about the line $y = k$ of a point $(x_1, y_1) = (h_1, k)$.

        " \nLet\u2019s reflect $(x,y)$ about the line $y=k$. We will exchange:$x$:$(x-2h+2h)$\n$y$:$(2k-k)$\nNow we have $-x$ and $k$. ",
        " Given a parabola $y=ax^2+bx+c$ with a vertex at $(h,k)$, we know that the vertex form of the parabola is $y=a(x-h)^2+k$. Reflecting the parabola about the line $y=k$ doesn\u2019t change the $y$-coordinate, but it changes the $x$-coordinate by flipping it about the axis of symmetry, which is $x=h$. So, the new parabola is $y=a((x-h)+h)^2+k=d(x-h)^2+k$ for some constant $d$. Expanding the right side of this equation, we get $y=d(x-h)^2+k=d(x^2-2hx+h^2)+k=x^2d-2hx^2k+h^2d+(k)$, which is the equation for the parabola $y=ax^2+ex+f$. Thus, $a=d$, $b=-2hk$, $c=h^2d+k$. To find the sum of these three values, we could calculate $d$, but since we\u2019re asked to give the value of $a+b+c+d+e+f$ in terms of $k$, we could manipulate the expression $a+b+c$ to cancel out $k$. Writing out the equation in vertex form gives $y=a(x-h)^2+k$, which we can also write as $(y-k)=a(x-h)^2$. Instead, let\u2019s write this equation as $y=k+a(x-h)^2$, which gives $a+b+c=a+(b-h)+c$. Now, we can replace $b$ and $c$ in terms of $a$ and $h$, but to keep the value of $a+b+c$ in terms of $k$, we would need to remember to also express $h$ in terms of $k$. We know that the vertex is $(h,k)$, so $k=k$, which is obvious. Next, we can write $h$ in terms of $k$ by noting that $k=a(h-h)^2+k$. Subtracting $k$ from both sides, we can find that the coefficient of $x^2$ in the vertex form of the parabola is zero, so $a(h-h)^2=0$, implying that $h=0$. To finally calculate $a+b+c$, we know that $a+b+c=a+(b-h)+c=a+b-0+c$, which we can substitute",

Then for every point on the original parabola where $y$ is given by $ax^2 + bx + c$, we have $2k - y = dx^2 + ex + f$.\n$$ax^2 + bx + c = 2k - dx^2 - ex - f.$$\n$$ax^2 + dx^2 + bx - ex + (c + f - 2k) = 0$$\n$$x^2(a + d) + x(b - e) + (c + f - 2k) = 0.$$\nJust to get rid of terms with $x$, we can move the terms with $x$ to the other side.\n$$x^2(a + d) - x(b - e) = c + f - 2k.$$\nNow, by completing the square,\n$$\\left(x^2\\left(\\frac{a + d}{2}\\right) + x\\left(-\\frac{b - e}{2}\\right)\\right)^2 = \\left(c + f - 2k - \\left(\\frac{a + d}{2}\\right)^2 - \\left(-\\frac{b - e}{2}\\right)^2\\right).$$\n$$\\left(x^2\\left(\\frac{a + d}{2}\\right) + x\\left(-\\frac{b - e}{2}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{b - e}{4}\\right)^2\\right)^2 = \\left(c + f - 2k + \\left(\\frac{a + d}{2}\\right)^2 - \\left(\\frac{b - e}{2}\\right)^2\\right).$$\nTake square roots of both sides. The square root of everything except for the rightmost term, take square.\n$$x^2\\left(\\frac{a + d}{2}\\right) + x\\left(-\\frac{b - e}{2}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{b - e}{4}\\right)^2 = \\pm \\sqrt{\\left(c + f - 2k + \\left(\\frac{a + d}{2}\\right)^2 - \\left(\\frac",
        " \nLet\u2019s proceed step by step.\nIn the original parabola $y=ax^2+bx+c$, since we know that $(h,k)$ is the vertex, we can complete the square to obtain\n\\begin{align*}\ny - k &= a(x-h)^2 \\\\\ny &= a(x-h)^2 + k.\n\\end{align*} \nNow, reflect this parabola about the line $y=k$. That means that we will be flipping the parabola about the line $y=k$:\nThis gives us the reflected parabola\n$$y=d(x-h)^2+k=d(x-h)^2+f.$$Expanding and simplifying, we find\n$$y=d(x^2-2hx+h^2)+f=dx^2-2hdx+f.$$Since $d=a$ and $-2hdx=-e$, we have that $f=k$, so $f=k$, which gives\n$$d=a,\\quad -2hdx=-e,\\text{ and }f=k,$$and combining these yields\n$$a+b+c+d+e+f=a-b+2k$$so now, all we need to do is find $b$ and $k$:\nNote that by completing the square, we have $h=\\frac{-b}{2a}$; also, we know that $k=c-\\frac{b^2}{4a}$. So, $k=c-\\frac{b^2}{4a}$, and $-2hdx=-e$. Therefore, the expression becomes:\n$$a+b+c+d+e+f=a-b+2\\left[c-\\frac{b^2}{4a}\\right]=a+b+c$$so its final form is $\\boxed{3a+b+c}$.\nThe final answer is 3a+b+c. I hope it is correct. I hope it is correct.\nSolution 2 (manually): We can analyze the vertex form of the parabola, $y=a(x-h)^2+k$. The parabola will be reflected across the line $y=k$, so the reflected parabola will still have a vertex of $(h,k)$. Thus, the new parabola must also have the vertex form $y=a(x-h)^2+k$. Therefore, the $d$ in the new parabola must be the same as the $a$ in the old parabola.\nWe can also compare the y-intercepts of the two parabolas",
        " \nStep 1. Identify the equation of the parabola after reflecting it about the line $y=k$.\nThe vertex is $(h,k)$. When you reflect it about $y=k$, the new equation is: $y- k = a(x-h)^2$. \nSo, the equation of the parabola after reflecting is: $y = a(x-h)^2 + k$ or $y = dx^2+ex+f$, where $d = a,~ e = -2ah, ~f = k$.\nStep 2. Identify the coefficients of the parabola equations.\nOriginal equation: $y = ax^2 + bx + c$.\nNew equation: $y = dx^2 + ex + f$.\nStep 3. Find out the relationship between the coefficients.\nWe can identify: $d = a, ~ e = -2ah + b, ~ f = c + k$.\nStep 4. Evaluate the sum of the coefficients.\nWe have $a + (-(2a h) + b) + (c+k)$. Combining terms we get: $a -2 ah + b + c+k$.\nStep 5. Analyze the given information.\nThe parabola equation is $y=ax^2+bx+c$. When you reflect it about $y=k$, the vertex $(h,k)$ becomes the axis of symmetry of the parabola.\nIt implies that $h = 0$, and $k$ is the vertex along the $y$-axis.\nSo, $h=0$, and $f = k$.\nStep 6. Simplify the result.\nWe know $h = 0$ and $f = k$:\n$a -2(0)a + b + c+k$\n$a + b + c + k$.\nStep 7. Write the final answer.\nThe final answer is $a+b+c+f=\\boxed{a+b+c+k}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $a+b+c+k$. I hope it is correct.",
        " Because we\u2019re reflecting about the line $y=k$, it means that $k$ becomes $2k-y$ after reflection, so we obtain:$$2k-y=(a)x^2+(b)x+(c)$$or equivalently,$\\begin{gather*}\n-y+(2k)=ax^2+bx+c\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n-y=k\\pm ax^2+bx+c\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\ny=k\\mp ax^2-bx-c\n\\end{gather*}$which is a parabola, so\n$$y=k-dx^2-ex+f$$with $d=-a$, $e=b$ and $f=c+k$. Therefore,$$a+b+c+d+e+f=-a+b+c+k-c+k=\\boxed{2k}.$$ Final Answer: The final answer is 2k. I hope it is correct.}}</latex>$$",
        " \nThe vertex of the original parabola is at $\\boxed {(h,k)}$, so the parabola can be written as $$(y-k) = a(x-h)^2.$$ Taking this parabola and reflecting it about $y=k$ gives us a function of the form $$(y-k)=dx^2.$$ Substituting $x$ for $x-h$ gives the function $$(y-k) = d(x-h)^2 = dx^2-dh.$$ To make the coefficients match up, we have that $a = d$ and $-2ah = e$, so $e = -2ah = -2ah$. Therefore,\n\\begin{align*}\na + b + c + d + e + f &= (a+d)+(b+e)+(c+f)\\\\\n&=a+(-2ah)+a+k+a+k\\\\\n&=a+a+k+k\\\\\n&=\\boxed{2a+2k}.\n\\end{align*}We know that the constant term of the original parabola is $k$, so $a(-h)^2+b(-h)+k=c$, giving $k=c$, so $c=k$. We have that $a+k=0$, since $h$ is halfway between the $x$-intercepts of the parabola, so $a+k=0$, and hence $k=-a$, so $a=-k$. Therefore, $a+k = \\boxed{0}$, so $2a+2k = \\boxed{0}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 0. I hope it is correct.",
        " \nStep 1: Determine $(h,k)$. In the original equation, the x-coordinate of the vertex is the x-coordinate where the parabola is just about to change direction. This happens when the derivative of the equation is 0. \n$$y=ax^2+bx+c\\Rightarrow y'=2ax+b=0\\Rightarrow x=-b/2a$$\n$$\\Rightarrow\\left(-\\frac{b}{2a}, ax^2+bx+c\\right)=\\left(-\\frac{b}{2a},a\\left(-\\frac{b}{2a}\\right)^2+b(-\\frac{b}{2a})+c\\right)=\\left(-\\frac{b}{2a},\\frac{b^2}{4a}+(-\\frac{b^2}{2a})+c\\right)=\\left(-\\frac{b}{2a},c\\right).$$\nUsing the vertex form: $$y=a(x-h)^2+k$$\n$$c=k-(ah^2).$$\nComparing the x-coordinates, $-\\frac{b}{2a}=h$.\nNow, the y-coordinate of the vertex is the y-coordinate of the parabola at the point $(h,k)$. This gives $k=ax^2+bx+c$, with $x=-\\frac{b}{2a}$.\n$$k=a\\left(-\\frac{b}{2a}\\right)^2+b\\left(-\\frac{b}{2a}\\right)+c\\Rightarrow k=\\frac{b^2}{4a}-\\frac{b^2}{2a}+c=\\frac{b^2}{4a}+\\left(c-\\frac{b^2}{2a}\\right)=\\frac{b^2}{4a}+k-(ah^2).$$\nThis means that $h=-\\frac{b}{2a}=\\frac{b}{-2a}=\\frac{b}{2a}$. Which is a contradiction. The contradiction implies that the original solution is incorrect. \nWe know that the function will be reflected across the line $y=k$. The reflection is given by \n\\begin{align*}\ny&=dx^2+ex+f\\\\\n&=d(x-h)^2+f+e(h-x).\n\\end{align*}\nWe know $(h,k)$ lies on both the original and the reflected parab",
        " By reflection across a line $y=k$, $y$-values are equal, but $x$-values are flipped. For a parabola with vertex at $(h,k),$ this means that $k$ is the turning point (the point at which the parabola changes direction). Also, since each new parabola in our problem has vertex $(h,k)$, we know that both original and new parabolas have the same x-intercepts as their turning points, meaning that they both equal $k$.\nFrom our problem, we have that $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ has vertex $(h,k)$, and that the parabola $y = dx^2 + ex + f$ is the reflection of $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ across $y = k$ (the line of reflection). If $a \\neq 0$, the vertex of $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ is the point of intersection of $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ and $y = k + a(x-h)^2$; the vertex of $y = dx^2 + ex + f$ is the point of intersection of $y = dx^2 + ex + f$ and $y = k + d(x-h)^2$; and the line of reflection is $y = k$. Since the vertex of $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ is the turning point of $y = ax^2 + bx + c$, we know that $ax^2 + bx + c = k + a(x-h)^2$, meaning that $(a(2h) + b) = 0$ (from discrimination ($a\\neq 0$)) (meaning that $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ has x-intercept at $x = h$, which must be true for the transformed parabola as well). The line of reflection, $y = k$, must be perpendicular to the tangent at $(h,k)$ (this can be seen in this diagram - http://mathbetrayal.com/Parabolarflection2.png). This means that the second derivative is zero since this parabola never becomes horizontal again. Thus, the quadratic in the reflected parabola is determined by the same second derivative for both curves at the turning point.\nSubstituting $(0,k)$ into $\\dfrac{d}{dx}(ax^2 + bx + c",
        "  The vertex of the original parabola $(h,k)$ is reflected about the line $y=k$ to become the vertex $(h,k)$. This means the vertex remains the same.\n### ",
        " \nThe given parabola has the vertex $(h,k)$.\n### ",
        " We have that the vertex $(h,k)$ of parabola $y=ax^2+bx+c$ satisfies $y=k$, so we must have that $ax^2+bx+c=k$.  Plugging in $x=h$, we find that\n$$ah^2+bh+c=k\\Rightarrow c=k-ah^2-bh.$$We also know that the axis of symmetry of parabola $y=ax^2+bx+c$ is $x=h$, so it follows that $(x-h)^2=0$ (for all $x$).  Plugging in $y=ax^2+bx+c$ and using our value for $c$, we get\n$$a(x-h)^2+b(x-h)+k-ah^2-bh=ay,$$which becomes $$a(x^2-2hx+h^2)+b(-x+h)=a(k-ah^2-bh)+k.$$If we now divide the equation by $a$, we get \n$$x^2-2hx+h^2+(-b/a)x(1)+(-k/a)=k-ah^2-bh,$$which means that\n$a=k$.  For the vertex Form of a parabola, the equation of the parabola is $y=k+a(x-h)^2$; so, when we multiply both sides of our equation by $a$, we get\n$$ay=ak+a(ax^2-2ahx+ah^2)=a(x^2-2hx+h^2).$$ The similarity between this equation and the previous one should not be a surprise (it is because they are referring to the same function).  We can now identify the vertex as $(x_1,y_1)=\\boxed{(h,k)}$. Now, the vertex Form of parabola $y=dx^2+ex+f$ tells us that $y=f+d(x-x_1)^2$.  We can write the vertex Form of parabola $y=ax^2+bx+c$, then.  Let\u2019s move $h^2$ to the right hand side then distribute , get  \\begin{align*} y &= a(x-h)^2+2ah+c+k\\\\ &=\\overbrace{ah}^a(x^2-2hx+h^2)+\\overbrace{-2ahk+2ah^2}^b(x-h)+(\\overbrace{k-ah^2-bh}^ck)\\\\",
        "  Reflected: We will visualize the reflection. Suppose that the parabola passes through a certain point $(x_0,y_0)$. Then, the line and point would look something like this,\nThe reflection of the point across the line would give us the point $(x_0,2y_0-k)$.\n### Part 2: New Coordinates\nIf we substitute $x_0,x_0,2y_0-k$ for $x,y,y$ respectively in the equation of the parabola ( $y=ax^2+bx+c$), we have \n\\begin{align*} \n2y_0-k&=a{x_0}^2+b{x_0}+c \n\\end{align*}Now, if we substitute the coordinates of the parabola\u2019s vertex into the equation of parabola, we get \n\\begin{align*} \nk&=ah^2+bh+c \n\\end{align*}\n### Part 3: Simplifying\nNow, if we subtract the equation containing the parabola from the previous equation, we get\n\\begin{align*} \n2y_0-k-a{x_0}^2-b{x_0}&=c-k \n\\end{align*}\n### Part 4: Finding the Equations\nSubtracting the two equations of parabola from each other, we get\n\\begin{align*} \ny-ax^2-bx-c=k \n\\end{align*}We then reflect this equation across the line $y=k$ to get\n\\begin{align*} \ny-2k-ax^2-bx-c&=0 \n\\end{align*}\n### Part 5: Simplifying further\nNow, we use a kind of algebraical manipulation,\n\\begin{align*} \n2k-y-ax^2-bx-c&=0 \n\\end{align*}  If you plug $y=k$ you get $ax^2+bx+(c-k)=0$\nThanks for that.

        " \nIt turns out the resulting parabola has a vertex at $(h,k)$. If the line $y=k$ is reflected, then the directrix will be at $(h,2k)$.  The vertex, $(h,k)$ on the parabola $y = ax^2+bx+c$ simultaneously satisfies the equation of the line y = k, meaning it is also on the line $y = k$, so $k = ah^2 + bh + c$.\nWith this information we can obtain the minimal equation of the original parabola:\n$y- k = ax^2+bx+c-k$.\nNow, we can relate the directrix of the equation (h, 2k) into our equation. As such the second degree equation must be equal to the second-degree equation of the reflected parabola:\n\\begin{align*}\na(x-h)^2+(y-k)=0\\\\\na(x-h)^2+(y-k)+k=0\\\\\na(x-h)^2+y-k=0.\n\\end{align*} At this point, we will then continue with the similarity proportionality\nBecause they all contain the exact same two quadratic equations.\nWith these conclusions, we will come up with the second formula for the parabola of symmetry. If it is linear, then:\n\\begin{align*}\na(x-h)^2= (y-k)+k.\n\\end{align*} On the other hand, keep in mind that the simplified formula of the image equation y = k is needed:\n\\begin{align*}\n- (x-h)^2+y-k=0\\\\\n-(x-h)^2+y-k-k=0\\\\\n-(x-h)^2+y-k-k=0.\n\\end{align*} We can proceed by using the proportionality characteristics of three to make a balance formula, so you can now be able to use:\n\\begin{align*}\na \\propto dx\n\\end{align*} Where k = k We will rearrange the structure of our images in a similar manner and rearrange the following formula to carry it out:\n\\begin{align*}\na(x-h)^2+(y-k)=0\\\\\na(x-h)^2+(y-k)+k=0\\\\\na(x-h)^2+y-k=0\\\\\na-d.\n\\end{align*} From all these results, we find out what the constant e. traditionally, d results in ($e -",
        " It may be helpful to sketch the graph of the original parabola, the line $y=k$, and the resulting parabola.
