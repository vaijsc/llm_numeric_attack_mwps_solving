        " 1.\nWe are asked to find $b+c$ where in the expression $x^2-6x+66=(x+b)^2+c$, $b$ and $c$ are constants. To find $b+c$, let\u2019s start by finding $b$ and $c$ one by one. It is given in the question that $x^2-6x+66$ can be written in the form $(x+b)^2+c$ with $b$ and $c$ as constants. So let\u2019s find the form first.\nBy using the formula $(x+a)^2=a^2+2ax$, we can write $x^2-6x+66$ as $\\boxed{(\\cdots)^2+(\\cdots)}$ below:\n\\begin{align*}\nx^2-6x+66&=(x+b)^2+c\\\\\n&=b^2+2bx+c\n\\end{align*}\n### ",
        " \n### Step 1: \nWe can start expanding $(x+b)^2+c$ to help us identify what it is: \n$(x+b)^2+c=(x+b)(x+b)+c=x^2+2bx+b^2+c$. \nWe can compare it with the given quadratic, $x^2-6x+66$. \n### Step 2: \nWe can see that $x^2+2bx+b^2$ is equal to the $x^2$ term of the given quadratic, so we can equate that part. \n$x^2+2bx+b^2=x^2-6x+66$. \n### Step 3: \nFrom here, we can subtract $x^2$ from both sides to get $2bx+b^2=-6x+66$. \n### Step 4: \nNext, we can factor out a $b$ from the left-hand side to get $b(x+2)=-6x+66$. \n### Step 5: \nThen, we can simplify the right-hand side of the equation by adding 6x to each side to get $b(x+2)=-6x+6x+66=66$. \n### Step 6: \nNow that we have simplified the right-hand side, we can divide both sides by $(x+2)$ to find $b=\\frac{66}{x+2}$. \n### Step 7: \nThere\u2019s a catch here! $b$ cannot be a variable because a quadratic always has two solutions to b and c. So, we can equate the numerator and denominator of $b$ to positive constants, let's say -6 and 8. \n$\\frac{66}{x+2}=\\frac{-6}{8}=-\\frac{3}{4}$ \n### Step 8: \nCross-multiplying, we can get $66\\cdot8=-6(x+2)=8x+12$ and solve for $x$. \n$522=8x+12$, \n$8x=522-12=510$, \n$x=63.75$ (approximately). \nSince $x=-\\frac{3}{4}$ would correspond to the denominator canceling out to zero, we reject this value. So, $b$ should be -\\frac{3}{4}. \n### Step 9: \nPut $b$ back into the expression $(x+b)^2+c$ to",
        " \nFirst, let\u2019s apply the formula $a=(x+b)^2+c$, where $b$ and $c$ are constants, comparing coefficients. \\begin{align*}\nx^2-6x+8^2 &= (x+b)^2+c \\\\\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\quad x^2-6x+(8^2+c) &= (x+b)^2+c \\\\\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\quad x^2-6x+66 &= (x+b)^2+c\n\\end{align*}Notice that $(x+b)^2=x^2+2bx+b^2$, so we can see that $2b=-6$ and $b^2+c=66$. From here, we get $b=-3$ and $c=66+3^2=\\boxed{75}.$ So, $b+c=-3+75=\\boxed{72}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 72.

        " We need to rewrite $x^2-6x+66$ as $(x)+66$. We know that if $(x)+(k)^2$c$, where $a$ and $c$ are constants, the sum of the coefficients of $x^2$ and $x$ are $a^2+2ak$. In this case, we have $a^2+2ak=a^2+2a(-3)=a^2-6a$. Therefore, we must have $a^2-6a=x^2-6x$, which simplifies to $a^2-6a+x^2-6x=0$. Factoring the left hand side gives $(a+x)(a+x-6)=0$, which means either $a+x=0$, or $a+x=6$. Case 1: $a+x=0 \\to x=-a$ So we have $0=a^2-6a+6a= a^2$ Therefore, $a=0$ Case 2: $a+x=6 \\to x=6-a$ So we have $0=(6-a)^2-6(6-a)+66$ or $(6-a)^2-6(6-a)+66=0$ Therefore, $6-a=\\pm \\sqrt{36+132}=6 \\pm \\sqrt{168}$ So we have $a=12 \\pm \\sqrt{168}$ The only value of $a$ which is real is $a=12-\\sqrt{168}$ Therefore, we have $b=12-\\sqrt{168}$ and $c=66$.

        " First, let\u2019s factor the quadratic. $x^2 -6x + 66 = (x - 3)(x - 22)$. Now we can see that $b$ and $c$ could be instead: $b$ = -3 (to get x squared from $x^2$) and $c$ = -22.

In this case, I will try to factor the quadratic as $(x+b)^2+c$ as given. I will start by finding the leading coefficient of 1, so that I must have $x^2$ expanded. In order to do this, I will complete the square. Completing the square, I have $(x^2-6x+???)=0$. Completing the square, I obtain $(x^2-6x+9)-9+???=0$. I know that $x^2-6x+9=(x-3)^2$, so I will use this. I also know that $-9+???=c$, so I will solve for $c$. Solving for $c$, I have $-9+c=66$, which gives $c=\\boxed{75}$. Therefore, the constant $c$ is 75. Now, I will solve for $b$. Since the problem told me that the expression would have the form $(x+b)^2+c$, I know that $b=-3$. Therefore, we have that $b=-3$ and $c=75$. The problem asks for the value of $b+c$, which is $-3+75=\\boxed{19}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 19. I hope it is correct.

        " Since the given quadratic is $x^2-6x+66$, we know that $(x+b)^2=c+x^2+2bx$. But we do not know what $2b$ is yet, so we have to find the coefficient of $x$ (which is $-6$) again using the fact that $2bx = -6$. Therefore, we have $2b=-6$, so $b=\\frac{-6}{2}=\\frac{-3}{1}=-3$.\n### Continuing: We also know that $c$ is an additive constant, so $66=c+x^2+2bx$. But in this case, we know that $2b=-6$, so $2(-3)=-6$. Substituting this in for $2b$, we see that $66=c+x^2+(-6)$. Rearranging the equation, we have $x^2-6x+c-66=0$, which means that $c$ is equal to 77. Therefore, $b+c=-3+77=\\boxed{74}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 74. I hope it is correct.

        " The quadratic expression is given by $$x^2 - 6x + 66.$$We want to write it in the form $(x + b)^2 + c$.  Expanding the expression on the right-hand side gives us $$x^2 + 2bx + b^2 + c.$$Equating this to our quadratic expression gives us $$x^2 + 2bx + b^2 + c = x^2 - 6x + 66.$$Setting the $x^2$ terms equal gives us $b^2 = 0$.  Setting the $x$ terms equal gives us $2b = -6$.  Setting the constants equal gives us $c = 66$.  Now, substituting the value of $b$ in terms of $c$ gives us $$c - b^2 = c - 0 = 66.$$Therefore, we have found that $b = -3$, $c = 66$, so $b + c = \\boxed{63}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 63.

        " $\\boxed{7}$\nRecall the sum of squares identity\n$$(x+a)^2=x^2+2ax+a^2.$$To write $x^2 - 6 x + 66$ in the desired form, we will need to recognize that $-(6 / 2)=3$ is the slope of the linear term in the quadratic $x^2-6x+66$.  We can then set $2a=-6$, so $a=-3$.  This means that our (customary linear) term in the quadratic $x^2-6x+66$ will be written as $-6x+(-2)(-3)$, which is $-6x+6$.
