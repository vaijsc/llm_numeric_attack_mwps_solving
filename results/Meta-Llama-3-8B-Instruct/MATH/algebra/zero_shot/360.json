        " \nWe see that $3x^2+7x+c=0$ has two real roots. For a quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ to have real roots, its discriminant $D=b^2-4ac$ must be non-negative. Here, we have $a=3, b=7$ and $c=c$. Therefore, we require that $D=(7)^2-4(3)(c)=49-12c\\ge0$. It follows that $49-12c\\ge0$, i.e. $12c\\le49$, and hence $0\\le c\\le49/12$. Of these integer values of $c$, only $\\boxed{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47}$ are valid ($49/12\\approx4.08$).

When $c=1$, the equation becomes $3x^2+7x+1=0$ which has no real roots because the discriminant is negative ($D=7^2-4(3)(1)=-7<0$). Therefore, we can disregard $c=1$ also. When $c=2$, we have $3x^2+7x+2=0$ which also has no real roots because $D=7^2-4(3)(2)=-19<0$. Therefore, we can disregard $c=2$ also.

        " The discriminant\nWhen the quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ has two real roots, its discriminant $D$ is positive: $D=b^2-4ac>0$.

Since $c$ is an integer and $D>0$, the minimum possible value of $D$ is $1$. So, $49-12c\\geq1$, which implies $c\\leq 24/3=8$. As $c$ is an integer, the possible values are $0,1,2,\\ldots,8$.\nWhen $c=0$, we have $D=49$ and the roots are $\\frac{-7\\pm\\sqrt{49}}{2}$.\nWhen $c=1$, $D=36$, which is the square of a real number. Hence, the roots are real and distinct.\nWhen $c=2$, $D=13$, which is the square of a real number.\nWhen $c=3$, $D=1$, the discriminant is $0$, which means that the roots are real and coincident.\nWhen $c=4$, the discriminant is again $0$. Hence, no more further values can make the discriminant positive.\nGiven $c$, there are at most two real roots. For $c=2$, the roots are real and distinct, but we do not split the solution process.\nHence, the product of all possible $c$ values are $2$ and $1$, which is $\\boxed{2}$.",

        " 1. Let $3x^2+7x+c=0$. To have two real roots, we need the discriminant of the quadratic equation to be non-negative, i.e., $$b^2-4ac\\ge0$$Here, we have $a=3$, $b=7$ and $c=c$.

If $c$ is too small, the discriminant will be negative. This means the quadratic equation will have no real roots.

        " The discriminant of a quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ is $b^2-4ac$. For the given equation, $a=3$, $b=7$ and $c=c$. The discriminant of the equation $3x^2+7x+c=0$ is $$\\Delta = 7^2-4(3)c = 49-12c,$$so the equation has two real roots if and only if $\\Delta \\geq 0$, i.e., $$49-12c\\geq0\\Rightarrow c\\leq49/12.$$On the other hand, since the equation has two real roots, its discriminant must be a perfect square. Therefore, $$49-12c=p^2$$where $p$ is some positive integer. We can solve for $c$ and get $$c=\\frac{49-p^2}{12}.$$Since $c$ is an integer, $p^2$ must be equal to the difference of two perfect squares: $p^2=y^2-z^2=(y-z)(y+z)$ for some positive integers $y\\geq z$. Then $$49-y^2+z^2=0\\Rightarrow y^2=z^2+49,$$so $y+z=\\sqrt{y^2+49}$, which must be an odd positive integer (since $y^2$ is even greater than 49). Since $y^2$ and $49$ are both odd, $z$ must be an odd positive integer. The smallest possible pair $(y,z)$ is then $(8,1)$, so $p=7$ and $c=\\frac{49-7^2}{12}=\\frac{16}{12}=4/3$.

By this method we also see that $c$ cannot be $\\frac{47}{3}$, so it must equal $\\frac{49}{12}$.
