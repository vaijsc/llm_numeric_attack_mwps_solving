        " 1. By the first equation, for any point $(x,y)$ on the unit circle, $x$ and $y$ can be considered as the lengths of the legs of a right triangle.  If $\\tan(\\theta)$ is called $\\frac{y}{x}$, the length of the hypotenuse is 1.\n2. By the second equation, the area of the sector is $\\frac{\\theta}{2\\pi} \\pi \\Rightarrow \\sin(\\theta) = \\frac{\\theta}{\\pi}$. But we know that $\\sin(\\theta) = \\frac{y}{x}$.

Use the formula for the area of an ellipse: area $\\pi ab$, $a^2 + b^2 = 1$. $x^4 a^2 + y^4 y^2 = \\frac{\\frac{17}{18}\\tan^4(\\theta)}{\\tan^4(\\theta) + 1}$ 1) We know that $b^2 = 1 - a^2$, so $\\tan^2(\\theta) = x^2(\\frac{1}{x^2} - 1) = 1 - x^2$, $a = \\sqrt{1 - x^2}$, $xy = x\\sqrt{1 - x^2}$, where $\\sin(\\theta) = \\frac{x\\sqrt{1 - x^2}}{x} = \\frac{\\tan(\\theta)}{x} = \\frac{y}{x}$.

Then, from $x^4 + y^4 = \\frac{17}{18}$, we know that $x^4$ and $y^4$ sum to $\\frac{17}{18}.$ Furthermore, we know these numbers are farthest from $1$ (in other words, the closest we can get to getting 0 or 1 with these numbers is 0 or 1, not half way to either, so their minimum value for $x^4 + y^4$ is when $x^2=y^2=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt 2}.$ So we can subtract $2x^2y^2$ from $x^4+y^4$ to get a value which gets closer to 0, so it will be positive and less than $\\frac{17}{18}$. \n### cont#### $(x^4 - 2x^2y^2 + y^4) + x^2y^2 = \\frac{17}{18}.$\n### cont####  Simplify \n#### $\\left( \\left( x^2 - y^2 \\right) ^2 \\right) + 4x^2y^2 = \\frac{17}{18}.$\n### cont####  Simplify \n#### $(x^2-y^2)^2+4x^2y^2 = \\frac{17}{18}.$\n### cont####  I tried a bunch of ways to solve, and I ended up solving it using the fact that $x^2+y^2=1$.

        " Since $x^2 + y^2 = 1$, we have $$(x+y)^2= (x^2+y^2)+2xy=1+2xy.$$  By the same way, we have$$(x-y)^2=(x^2+y^2)-2xy=1-2xy.$$  Adding these two equations together gives\n\\begin{align*} (x+y)^2+(x-y)^2 &= 2,\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad 2(x^2+y^2) &= 2,\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad x^2+y^2 &= 1 = (x+y)^2-(x^2+y^2). \\end{align*}  Since $(x+y)^2 = 1 + 2xy$, we have $$x+y = \\pm \\sqrt{1+2xy}.$$  The other equation is\n\\begin{align*} x^4+y^4 &=\\frac{17}{18},\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad (x^2+y^2)^2-(x^2-y^2)^2&=\\frac{17}{18},\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad \\left((x+y)^2-(x-y)^2\\right)\\left((x+y)^2+(x-y)^2\\right) &=\\frac{17}{18},\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad (2xy)\\cdot 2 &=\\frac{17}{18},\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad 4xy &=\\frac{17}{18}. \\end{align*}  Note that $x+y$ can be either positive or negative, so if it is positive, we have $$x+y=\\sqrt{1+2xy}=\\sqrt{\\frac{17}{18}\\cdot(x-y)^2+1}=1+x-y+\\frac{17}{36}(x-y)^2.$$  On the other hand, if $x+y$ is negative, then we have $$x+y=-\\sqrt{1+2xy}=-\\sqrt{\\frac{17}{18}(x-y)^2+1}=-(1+x-y+\\frac{17}{36}(x-y)^2).$$  In either case, we can cross multiply to get \\begin{align*} (x-y)^2\\left(\\frac{17}{36}(x-y)^2+4\\right)&=36,\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad \\frac{17}{36}(x",
        "Step 1: Write the given equations in a more convenient form.

Multiplying both sides by $108$ we have $(x^2-y^2)^2-2x^2y^2+108=17$, which also can be written as $\\left(x^2+y^2-(x^2-y^2)\\right)^2-2x^2y^2+108=17$, or $(1-2x^2y^2)-2x^2y^2+108=17$, or $1-4x^2y^2+108=17$, or $22=4x^2y^2$, or $x^2y^2=11/4$.

Therefore the maximum of $xy$ in the given condition happens when $x=y=1/\\sqrt{2}$ and the minimum of $xy$ happens when $x=\\sqrt{11}/2$, $y=0$.

        " Since $x^2+y^2=1$, we have $y^2=1-x^2$.  Then, we substitute this expression for $y^2$ in $x^4+y^4=17/18$.  Notice that \\begin{align*}\nx^4+y^4&=\\frac{17}{18}\\\\\nx^4+(1-x^2)^2&=\\frac{17}{18}\\\\\nx^4+1-2x^2+x^4&=\\frac{17}{18}\\\\\n2x^4-2x^2+1&=\\frac{17}{18}\\\\\n2(x^4-x^2+\\frac{1}{36})&=\\frac{17}{18}-\\frac{2}{36}=\\frac{31}{36}\\\\\n2(x^2-\\frac{1}{4})^2&=\\frac{31}{36}\\\\\n(x^2-\\frac{1}{4})^2&=\\frac{31}{72}\\\\\nx^2-\\frac{1}{4}&=\\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{31}}{6\\sqrt{2}}\\\\\nx^2&=\\frac{1}{4}\\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{31}}{6\\sqrt{2}}.\n\\end{align*}Now, we substitute these expressions for $x^2$ in $x^2+y^2=1$.  In particular, we have\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{4}\\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{31}}{6\\sqrt{2}}+y^2&=1\\\\\n\\frac{1}{4}\\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{31}}{6\\sqrt{2}}+1-x^2&=1\\\\\n\\frac{1}{4}\\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{31}}{6\\sqrt{2}}+1-x^2&=1\\\\\n\\frac{1}{4}\\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{31}}{6\\sqrt{2}}&=\\frac{1}{2}-x^2.\n\\end{align*}Note that $\\frac{1}{2}-x^2\\le0$ since $x^2\\ge0$.  Thus, $\\frac{1}{4}\\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{31}}{6\\sqrt{2}}\\le0$, which gives\n$$\\frac{\\sqrt{31}}{",
        " Let\u2019s think step by step.\nWe begin by expanding the squares in square root form:\n\\begin{align*}\nx^2+y^2&=1\\\\\n(x+y)(x-y)&=1\n\\end{align*}\nHere, $x+y$ and $x-y$ must multiply to 1.  Thus, one of them has to be 1, and the other must be -1.  In a way, we can think of it as $(x+y)(x-y)$\u00a0being a special kind of product that gives us 1."
