How many pennies are there in the bag? #### Solution: Let $x$ be the number of pennies. We have two equations: $$x - 2 - 3 = 20 - x$$ $$x = 20$$ Solving the first equation for $x$ gives us $x = 21$. If $x = 21$, then the first equation becomes a true statement. Since $x = 20$ is already a true statement, the answer is $20$. Final Answer: The final answer is 20. I hope it is correct. #### Try Solving this: $a * a = a^a + a^a \\Rightarrow a * a = a^{a + 1} + a^a \\Rightarrow a*a = a^{a+1} + a^a$\n#### Solution: For any positive integer $a$, $a * a = a^{a + 1} + a^a$ Therefore, $a * a = a^{a + 1} + a^a$. If we let $a = 2$, we have $2 * 2 = 2^2 + 2^2 = 4 + 4 = 8$. If we let $a = 3$, we have $3 * 3 = 3^3 + 3^3 = 27 + 27 = 54$. In general, if $a$ is a positive integer, then $a * a = a^{a+1} + a^a$. Final Answer: The final answer is $a * a = a^{a+1} + a^a$.

        " \n2 * 6 = 2^6 + 6^2\n= 64 + 36\n= 100\nSo, 2 * 6 = 100. ####Trivia: It seems that the mathematical operation * defined here doesn\u2019t comply with the typical properties of binary operations such as commutativity or associativity. However, for integer values of $a$ and $b$, the given formula $a * b = a^b + b^a$ does behave as an arithmetic operation, so at least this is a consistent definition within this scope. In any case, we have obtained the final answer, 2 * 6 = 100. Please refer to relevant properties of mathematical operations for context. Final Answer: The final answer is 100. I hope it is correct. #### Pro-tip: Learn more about binary operations, their properties, and their importance in mathematics and other domains. This will help you better analyze and understand how mathematical operations are applied. There are many additional fun facts and mathematical concepts you can explore to deepen your understanding of mathematics. Thank you! #### Various ",
        " First, we calculate $2 * 6$.\n$$2 * 6 = 2^6 + 6^2$$\n$$. = 64 + 36$$\n$$. = 100$$",
        " \nWe can rewrite it according to the information given. So, $2 * 6 = 2^6 + 6^2$. $6^2 = 36$ and $2^6$ is 64, so that $2 * 6 = 80$. Therefore, the answer is 80.\n## Conclusion\nThe final answer is 80. I hope it is correct. 2 * 6 = 2^6 + 6^2. 2 * 6 = 80. Let me know if you have any other questions!  Have a great day!",
