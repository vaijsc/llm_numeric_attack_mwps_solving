        " $\\boxed{12}$\nGiving the Constraint: $$2x^2-4x-9=0$$We can solve it by formula and factor. First, using the quadratic formula. $x=\\frac{4\\pm\\sqrt{16+72}}{4}=\\frac{4\\pm\\sqrt{88}}{4}=\\frac{2\\pm\\sqrt{22}}{1}$\nFactoring: $2x^2-4x-9=0\\\\(2x-9)(x+1)=0\\\\2x-9=0\\quad\\text{or}\\quad x+1=0\\\\x=4.5\\quad\\text{or}\\quad x=-1$\nHence, we have $x=\\frac{2+\\sqrt{22}}{1}$ or $x=4.5$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 12. I hope it is correct. If you have any query, then feel free to comment.\n$2x^2 - 4x - 9 = 0$ is a given equation. We need to find out the value of $x$ and then express it in the form $\\frac{a + \\sqrt{b}}{c}$\nFor that, we can solve this quadratic equation. First, let us take the equation to the other side and then divide both sides by 2.\n$x^2 - 2x - \\frac{9}{2} = 0$\nNow, we can factor the equation:\n$\\left( x - 3 \\right)\\left( x + 1 \\right) = 0$\nNow, we can solve for $x$ by making two equations and not equal to zero.\nLet us take $x - 3 = 0$\n$x = 3$\nAnd, let us take $x + 1 = 0$\n$x = -1$\nSo, we have two values of $x$, which are $x = 3$ and $x = -1$\nNow, we should express the value of $x$ in the form $\\frac{a + \\sqrt{b}}{c}$\nSo, we have $x = 3$ and we should express $x = 3$ in the form $\\frac{a + \\sqrt{b}}{c}$.\nSo, we have $x = 3$ and we can write that $x = \\frac{3}{1}$\nAnd,",
        " We have\n$2x^2 - 4x = 9$\n$x^2 - 2x - \\frac{9}{2} = 0$ \n$(x - 3)(x + 1) = 0$\nThus, $x$ can be written as $\\dfrac{a+\\sqrt{b}}{c}$ where $a = 1$, $b = 4$, and $c = 2$. Thus, $a+b+c=1+4+2=\\boxed{7}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 7. I hope it is correct. 0 labor time. labor time.\n### Final Answer: The final answer is 7.

        " $2x^2 = 4x + 9$\nThe first step is to subtract $4x$ from both sides: $2x^2-4x=9$\nThen, factor out an $x$ from the left-hand side: $2x(x-2)=9$\n### Problem: $2x(x-2)=9$\nThe next step is to factor $9$.\n### Problem: $2x(x-2)=2x (x-3+1)=2x(x-3)+2x=9$\nThis gives us $x(x-3)+2x=9$\nSo, we have $x^2 - 3x+2x=9$.\n### Problem: $x^2 - 3x+2x=9$\nCombine like terms: $x^2-3x+2x=9$\nRemove the constants: $x^2-3x+2x-9=0$\nSolve for $x$: $(x-3)^2=0$\n### Solution: $x-3=0$\nAdd $3$ to both sides: $x=3$\nSo, the solution is $x=3$.\n### Value of a + b + c\nThe value of $a+b+c$ is $\\boxed{7}$.
