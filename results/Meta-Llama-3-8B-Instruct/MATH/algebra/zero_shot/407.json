        " \nIf the quadratic equation $x^2 + mx + (m+n) = 0$ has only one real solution, then this means that the discriminant of the equation is equal to $0$. Therefore, $$m^2+4(m+n)=0\\Rightarrow m^2+4m+4n=0.$$Notice that $m^2+4m+4n=\\bigl(m+2\\bigr)^2+4n-4$. Thus, we need $(m+2)^2+4n-4=0$, which simplifies to $4n-4=(m+2)^2$. Since the left-hand side is a constant, the right-hand side must also be a constant. This implies that $(m+2)^2$ must be constant, and we can solve for $n$. Note that $m$ can be any real number, so $(m+2)^2$ can have many values. The only way to ensure that $(m+2)^2$ is a constant is if it is equal to $0$. This gives $m+2=0$, and so $\\boxed{n=-2}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -2. I hope it is correct.  I  would still like to make a final note that such a value of $n$ is not actually guaranteed by the problem, but rather is the only possible value of $n$ that produces the unique solution. In the actual solution, we observed that $m$ is no matter and always $0$. And if $m$ is 0, then we can choose any number to $n$ and still have one real solution. But the problem does not guarantee the value for $m$. And no matter what the question asks.  But the most important thing is that you should have your understanding of solution and your perspective on the problem.\nLet me know if you need any further help. \nI hope these notes help in your learning process.

        " We want a unique solution. This means the discriminant is zero. So, we can write:$$m^2-4\\cdot(m+n)=0$$We want a unique solution for m, so b = 0, not a = 0. If the equation would have a = 0 then m^2 would be zero and m would be zero too, then b would be zero toothen there would not be one unique value for m. So, m^2 - 4(m+n) = 0, we multiply both sides: m^2-4m-4n=0 We can reduce it to a quadratic equation of m. m^2-4m+(4n)=0 We can find the solution of m: m = (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2-4ac)) / 2a m = (-(4) \u00b1 sqrt((-4)^2-4(1)(4n))) / 2(1) m = (-4 \u00b1 sqrt(16-16n)) / 2 m = (-4 \u00b1 sqrt(4(4-n))) / 2 m = (-4 \u00b1 2sqrt(1-n)) / 2\n### Step 4: Solve the quadratic equation m = (-4 \u00b1 2sqrt(1-n)) / 2\nWhen we look at the solution m, we can see that there are 2 solutions. And that\u2019s because the equation has a symmetry, and it shows that the equation has only one real solution. We can make some observations. The term 2sqrt(1-n) is for real for n smaller than 1. If n is higher than 1, the equation would not have a real solution anymore. That\u2019s why the value n must be less than or equal to 1.\n### Step 5: Write the solution m in terms of n\nWe\u2019ve seen before that the equation m = (-4 \u00b1 2sqrt(1-n)) / 2 only has one real solution if n is less than or equal to 1. When n is equal to 1, the expression under the square root symbol becomes 0. So m = (-4 \u00b1 0) / 2 = -2 m = -2 We can see that when n = 1, there is no real solution. So, n cannot be equal to 1.
