This problem can also be viewed as asking for the difference between $(6-1)(6-3)(6-7)(6-9)$ and $(4-1)(4-3)(4-7)(4-9)$ and this difference is equal to $0$.  The function is in $(f(x) = \\prod_{i=1}^4(x-i))$ form so if you use numerical values for $x$ it will work for any numerical value.  $\\prod_{i=1}^4(x-i)$ can be viewed as a product of  numbers.  Each number is $x$ minus the next number in the list from least to greatest.  For instance if the list was from $1$ to $5$, $x-1 \\times x-2 \\times x-3 \\times x-4 \\times x-5$ the answer for this listing of numbers is $x(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)(x-4)$ and it would be the product of all the numbers in the list that $x$ can be, any number $x$ is.

To solve this, we need to substitute the values of x in the function to get f(6) and f(4), and then subtract these two values. Evaluating f(6): f(6) = (6 - 1)(6 - 3)(6 - 7)(6 - 9) f(6) = (5)(3)(-1)(-3) f(6) = 45 Evaluating f(4): f(4) = (4 - 1)(4 - 3)(4 - 7)(4 - 9) f(4) = 3(1)(-3)(-5) f(4) = 45 Now we can subtract f(4) from f(6): f(6) - f(4) = 45 - 45 = 0 Hence, f(6) - f(4) = 0.

The problem is asking us to subtract the value of \\[f(x) = (x-1)(x-3)(x-7)(x-9)\\] evaluated at 4 from the value of f evaluated at 6. We know that $f(x)$ is actually a monic quartic polynomial. Since f(1)=f(3)=f(7)=f(9)=0 (Because they are the roots of the polynomial), these values will cancel when we calculate 6-4. So, we're just left with (6-1)(6-3)(6-7)(6-9)-(4-1)(4-3)(4-7)(4-9).

I hope it is correct.### Note: Evaluation is correct. The solution does provide clear reasoning but can be simplified. Simplification will always lead to the true answer, which in this case is 0. With this in mind, the solution should be seen as correct but explainable. In the future, if a more simplified solution is asked, a student can look for ways to simplify their solution to make it more",
