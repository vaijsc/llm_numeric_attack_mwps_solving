I hope it is correct. sigma (question: How do we get 5^3=125?) In the expression $5^5+5^5+5^5+5^5+5^5=5\\cdot5^5$, we just express the sum of 5 identical terms all with $5^5$ as a common term. Recognizing that we are adding 5 identical terms with $5^5$, we then find a common factor of 5. Hence, $5\\cdot5^5$ is written as the expression above.\nWe then use the power rule on $\\sqrt{5\\cdot5^5}$ to simplify it as $5^3$. Indeed, $\\sqrt{x^n}=x^{n/2}$, where this property is not limited to integers but to any real numbers. Hence, we conclude that the value of $\\sqrt{5^5+5^5+5^5+5^5+5^5}$ is equal to 125. \nHence, our final answer is 125. We should be able to verify this answer if you calculate the roots of squares term by term to add them then calculate $\\sqrt{5 \\cdot 5^5}$ You will get 5^3 which is equal to 125.

Why is it 5^5? Because the power of a number added to itself times n is equal to the number itself raised to the power. Hence, 5*5^5 = 5^1*5^5 = (5^5)^(1+1). = 5^5 * 2 = 5^5. You are welcome!

        " Final Answer\nIn mathematics, when we take a square root, we are essentially finding the number that we multiplied by itself gives the desired number. The formula for a square root is as follows:\n\u221ax = y, where y * y = x\nThis means we have to find the square root of 5^5+5^5+5^5+5^5+5^5\n### How Answer Works\nTo begin with, we simplify the given problem by understanding what we are dealing with. It seems like we have a large sum of numbers but since they are the same, we can simplify it into a single exponentiated number by adding the exponents.\n5^5+5^5+5^5+5^5+5^5 becomes 5^5 * 5 (since there are 5)\nThe simplified problem looks like this: 5^[5*5]\nThe key to this question is to know the properties of exponents; when you multiply two numbers with the same base (for example, 5) and different exponents (for example, 5), the exponent of the result is the sum of the two exponents. This is known as the sum of exponents.\nFrom this, we can further simplify the expression: 5^[5*5] = 5^[25]\n### Conclusion\nIn conclusion, we have simplified and re-solved the problem based on the properties of exponents. Now we can easily evaluate the square root; since it is the square of the number we found using the rules of exponents. The square root of 5^[25] is indeed 5^[12.5]. 5^[12.5] = 5^[2*6.25+1] = 5^[2*6.25]*5.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 5^[12.5]. I hope it is correct. \u0645\u062d\u06444263\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 125. I hope it is correct."
