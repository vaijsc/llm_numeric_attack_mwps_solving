        " \nIf two (positive) prime numbers are roots of the equation $x^2-12x+k = 0$ , we can use the quadratic formula to find the roots. The quadratic formula gives us that $r_{1,2}=\\frac{-b\\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$ . In this case, $a=1,b=-12$ and $c=k$ .

        " \n1. Let\u2019s suppose we have the two roots of the equation. For simplicity, let the two roots be $p$ and $q$.\n2. Since we are given that $p$ and $q$ are both prime and positive, we can write the equation as $(x-p)(x-q)=x^2-12x+k$.\n3. Expand the left hand side of the equation: $x^2-(p+q)x+pq$.\n4. Compare the coefficients of the equation. From steps 2 and 3, the coefficient of $x$ is $-p-q$, not $-12$. This is a contradiction.\n5. Since we couldn\u2019t find a positive prime root of the equation, we can try to find a non-prime root.\n6. Let\u2019s say that $k$ is not divisible by any primes greater than $5$, so $k$ itself must be smaller than $2^2\\times3\\times5=60$.\n7. Brute force the trial and error. We find that when $k=32$, the two roots of the equation are $16$ and $8$. Notice that $16$ and $8$ are not primes, but they are roots of the equation.\n8. It is easy to verify that $x^2-12x+32=0$ have roots $16$ and $8$, by direct computation.\n9. It is also easy to verify that $(x-16)(x-8)=x^2-24x+128$, which is not $x^2-12x+32$.\nNow we have found that when $k=32$, the roots of the equation are $16$ and $8$.

        " \n**Step 1: Understand the question**\nWe are given an equation: $x^2 - 12x + k = 0$ where two positive prime numbers are the roots of the equation.\n**Step 2: Understand what\u2019re prime numbers**\nA prime number is a positive integer that is divisible only by 1 and itself. For example, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, etc.\n**Step 3: Understand what\u2019re the roots of the equation**\nIn the equation $x^2 - 12x + k = 0$, the roots are $x_1$ and $x_2$ that satisfy $x^2 - 12x + k = (x-x_1)(x-x_2) = 0$.\n**Step 4: Apply factorization**\nSince we are told that two positive prime numbers are the roots, we can assume that $x_1$ and $x_2$ are both prime. Therefore, we can factor the equation in the following way:\n$x^2 - 12x + k = (x-p)(x-q) = x^2 - (p+q)x + pq = x^2 - 12x + k$\nwhere $p$ and $q$ are the two prime numbers.\n**Step 5: Equate coefficients**\nComparing the coefficients of $x$, we get $p+q = 12$. Since both $p$ and $q$ are prime numbers, it must be the case that $(p,q) = (2,3)$ or $(3,2)$ or $(p,p) = (5,7)$ or $(7,5)$ since the only sum of two distinct prime numbers less than 12 is 11, which is not a prime number, and a prime number cannot be equal to its additive inverse (except the number 0).\n**Step 6: Find the value of k**\nNow, let\u2019s find the value of $k$. We can use the fact that $pq = 6$. If $p = 2$ and $q = 3$, then $k = pq = 6$. If $p = 5$ and $q = 7$, then $k = pq = 35$. But in both cases, $k$ is not positive.\nTherefore, there is no positive value for $k$. The answer is $\\boxed{\\text{None}}$",
        " \nGiven that two prime numbers are roots of the equation $x^2-12x+k=0$, so these two prime numbers satisfy the equation. \nFirst, we can solve the equation to get\n\\begin{align*}\nx=\\frac{12\\pm\\sqrt{144-4k}}{2}.\n\\end{align*}\nSince we want two distinct prime numbers, so we know that $\\sqrt{144-4k}$ is not an integer. But we can choose 7 and 11, the first two primes, to see if they are possible roots. \nIndeed, we can check that $x-7=0$ and $x-11=0$ are both satisfied by the above equation when $k=77$. This implies that $7$ and $11$ are the roots of the equation, so $\\boxed{k=77}$. \nFinal Answer: The final answer is 77. I hope it is correct. \n### Improvement Ideas: \n1. This solution might be clearer if the above equation is solved for $k$.\n2. It might be interesting to consider the converse of this problem: given two distinct prime numbers, can you find the corresponding value of $k$?\n3. If you want to be more general, you can also consider prime numbers other than $7$ and $11$, or consider complex roots. \n4. You could also think about what modifications need to be made if the two prime numbers are negative.  This might be especially important for negative discriminants, as they can produce imaginary roots.\n5. More details can be given on how the choice of 7 and 11 and the way to check if they are solutions. \n6. Can the answer ever be negative? If not, why?
