This means that the graph of the function $f(x)$, which is a parabola opening upwards, has two $x$-intercepts.  Assuming that the parabola opens up, we have that $f(x)$ is a quadratic function, and its roots, or zeroes, are given by the solutions to $2x^2+mx+8=0$.  A quadratic function with roots $r_1$ and $r_2$ has the form $f(x)=c(x-r_1)(x-r_2)$.\nBecause the polynomial $2x^2+mx+8$ is a quadratic function, we have that $f(x)=2x^2+mx+8$.  Therefore, we have that $2x^2+mx+8=2(x-r_1)(x-r_2)$.  Expanding the right-hand side of this equation, we get $2x^2+mx+8=2x^2-2(r_1+r_2)x+2r_1r_2$.  This simplifies to $-2(r_1+r_2)x+2r_1r_2=mx+8$.  Therefore, we have $m=-2(r_1+r_2)$ and $2r_1r_2=8$.  From this equation, we can see that the quantity $r_1r_2$ must be equal to $4$, which means that the quantities $r_1$ and $r_2$ can either be $2$ and $2$, or they can be a complex number pair, $\\big(\\frac{-b+\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a},\\frac{-b-\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\\big)$.\nLet us first consider when $r_1,r_2=2,2$.  This means that $-2(2+2)=m$, or $m=-8$.\nNow, let us consider the case where $r_1,r_2$",

I hope it is correct.  If $m$ is a real number and $2x^2+mx+8$ has two distinct real roots, then what are the possible values of $m$?  Express your answer in interval notation.  We can write  $2x^2+mx+8$ as $(2x+4-\\frac{m}{2})(x+\\frac{m}{4}+2)$.  For the quadratic to have two distinct real roots, the discriminant must be positive, so $\\frac{m^2}{4} - 4(8) > 0$.

        " If x1 and x2 are distinct real roots to the equation f(x) = 2x^2+mx+8 = 0 then we can find the value of m by looking at the discriminant of the quadratic.  In other words, we use the formula:\n$(m)^2 - 4(2)(8) \\geq 0$.\n### Solution:\nWe are given that $m$ is a real number.  Since $f(x)$ has real roots, its discriminant must be nonnegative.  Therefore, $(m)^2 - 4(2)(8) \\geq 0$.  This implies that $m^2 - 32 \\geq 0$.  Dividing both sides of the inequality by $1$ yields $m^2 \\geq 32$.  Since $m$ is a real number, it is true that $m \\geq 0 \\text { or } m \\leq 0$.  If $m \\geq 0$, then $m^2 \\geq 4^2$, which implies that $m \\geq 4$.  If $m \\leq 0$, then $m^2 \\leq (-4)^2$, which implies that $m \\leq -4$.
