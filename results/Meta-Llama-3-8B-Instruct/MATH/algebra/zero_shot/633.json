We can first solve for $\\Delta x$ and $\\Delta y$. Since the midpoint is $(1,1)$, we can subtract those numbers from both the $x$ and $y$ values of the endpoint on the $x$-axis, $(6,8)$. So, we find that $$\\begin{align} \\Delta x&=6-1=5,\\\\ \\Delta y&=8-1=7. \\end{align}$$  We now solve for the other endpoint. Since it is the \u201copposite\u201d endpoint, the endpoint opposite a point $(a,b)$ with respect to the midpoint $(x,y)$, we take the two numbers we found minus the midpoint. So, $$(x-\\Delta x,y-\\Delta y)=((6,8), (1,1)).$$The opposite of $\\Delta x$ and $\\Delta y$ is $-5$ in both cases, because there are the same $5$ and $7$ numbers away from $(1,1)$.

        " The line segment has one endpoint at $(6,8)$. We are also given that the midpoint is $(1,1)$. The midpoint of the line segment between the points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ is $\\left(\\frac{x_1+x_2}{2},\\frac{y_1+y_2}{2}\\right)$. Using this formula, we can set up a system of equations: $$\\frac{6+x_2}{2}=1,\\quad\\frac{8+y_2}{2}=1.$$This gives $x_2=-4$ and $y_2=-4$. Therefore, the other endpoint is $\\boxed{(-4,-4)}$. The sum of these coordinates is $(-4)+(-4)=\\boxed{-8}$.\n### Another approach:\nAnother way of thinking about the problem is that the standard form of the equation of a line segment is$$\\left|\\frac{x-x_1}{x_2-x_1}\\right|=\\frac{y-y_1}{y_2-y_1}.$$Using this formula, we can plug in the values for the midpoint and one of the endpoints to obtain \\begin{align*}\n\\left|\\frac{x-6}{x-6}\\right|&=\\frac{y-8}{y-8}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad\\quad\\qquad\\quad |x-6|&=|y-8|\\\\\n&=|y-8|\\\\\n\\end{align*}\nThis implies that $y=8$ and $\\boxed{x=-4}$.

The sum of these coordinates is $\\boxed{-4}$.\n### Note: It is important to remember that the midpoint is always the average of the $x$-coordinates and the average of the $y$-coordinates.

        " \nThe midpoint of a line segment is the point that divides it into two equal parts, so if $(6, 8)$ is one endpoint and $(1, 1)$ is the midpoint, we know that the line segment is going to split into two parts, each with a length of $\\lVert(6, 8) - (1, 1)\\rVert$.\n### Calculation:\n$$\\lVert(6, 8) - (1, 1)\\rVert=\\sqrt{(6-1)^2+(8-1)^2}=\\sqrt{5^2+7^2}=\\sqrt{25+49}=\\sqrt{74}$$\nThe other endpoint is at a distance of $\\sqrt{74}$ from the midpoint $(1, 1)$. We can find the coordinates of the other endpoint by adding $\\sqrt{74}$ to the midpoint coordinates, or subtracting $\\sqrt{74}$ from the endpoint coordinates.\n### Finding the other endpoint:\nCall the other endpoint $(x, y)$. Then,\n$$(x, y) = (6 + \\sqrt{74}, 8 + \\sqrt{74})$$or\n$$(x, y) = (6 - \\sqrt{74}, 8 - \\sqrt{74})$$\n### Sum of coordinates:\nNow, we can just add the coordinates up:\n$$x+y=(6+\\sqrt{74})+(8+\\sqrt{74})=\\boxed{14+2\\sqrt{74}}$$\n### Note:\nOur choice of adding $\\sqrt{74}$ to both coordinates would have also worked. This method is good for learners, because it shows them how coordinate algebra works, while our other choices are better suited to test-takers, who can quickly plug in the numbers. The question could also be phrased better to make this clearer. In any case, our guess for the least risky approach is to add $\\sqrt{74}$ to both coordinates. What do you guys think? Do you agree? How would you phrase the question differently? Would the problem be better written if the endpoint were further away from the midpoint? Would it be better written if the coordinates were more symmetric?
