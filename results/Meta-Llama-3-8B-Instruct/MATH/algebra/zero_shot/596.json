We can achieve this by using the identities that $$ \\sin(\\pi/3)=\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} $$ and $$ \\cos(4\\pi/3)=-\\frac{1}{2} $$ . Thus, we have\n$$ \\sin^{-1}(\\sin(2\\",

        " 0.09\nThe first thing we need to do is to find $(3.6)^2$. You should know the formula for squaring the magnitudes of numbers that are having fractions. But I shall remind you. Squaring the magnitude of any number which is having fraction means the each number which is written after decimal point will first brought at its left place. We will multiply the two parts, thereby they are multiplied by themselves. Then add them. Now, we have\n$$3.6 = 3 + 0.6$$\nThen, $(3.6)^2 = (3+0.6)^2$\n\\begin{align*}\n(3+0.6)^2 &= (3)^2 + 2 \\cdot (3) \\cdot (0.6) + (0.6)^2\\\\\n(3.6)^2 &= 9 + 3.6 + 0.36\\\\\n(3.6)^2 &= 12.96\n\\end{align*}\nSo, evaluating $(3.6)^2$.\nNext thing to do is to evaluate $\\lceil (3.6)^2 \\rceil$. We are to find out the smallest odd number in which $12.96$ lies. We shall find $\\lceil 12.96 \\rceil$, then evaluate $12.96$ with this number, so that we can find the smallest number where the number lies. $\\lceil 12.96 \\rceil = 13$.\n\\begin{align*}\n\\lceil (3.6)^2 \\rceil - ( \\lceil 3.6 \\rceil ) ^2 &= 13 - (3)^2\\\\\n&= 13 - 9\\\\\n&= 4\n\\end{align*}",
