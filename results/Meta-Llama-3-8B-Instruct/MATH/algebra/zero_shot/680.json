        " Let\u2019s start with two relatively prime positive integers $x$ and $y$. If we write their product minus their sum as 39, we get \n$$xy - (x+y) = 39.$$We can simplify this equation by rearranging it: \n$$xy - x - y = 39.$$Factoring out an $x$ and a $y$:  $$x(y - 1) = y + 39.$$ Since the integers are less than 20, it follows that $y$ cannot be larger than 19; we can solve the above equation accordingly: \n$$(y - 1) = \\dfrac{y + 39}{x}.$$ If we substitute integers for $y$ from 1 up to 19, we can find the values of $x$ that make this equation true.  The table below shows the values:\n| y | (y\u22121) | x| \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-|-\u2014\u2014\u2014-|-\u2014\u2014\u2014-| | 1 | 0 | undefined | | 2 | -1 | 40 | | 3 | -2 | 20 | | 4 | -3 | 15 | | 5 | -4 | 12 | | 6 | -5 | 11 | | 7 | -6 | 10 | | 8 | -7 | 9 | | 9 | -8 | 8 | | 10 | -9 | 7 | | 11 | -10 | 6 | | 12 | -11 | 5 | | 13 | -12 | 4 | | 14 | -13 | 3 | | 15 | -14 | 2 | | 16 | -15 | 1 | | 17 | -16 | undefined | | 18 | -17 | undefined | | 19 | -18 | undefined |\nWe can see that only three values of $y$ give us valid solutions: $y=2$, $y=3$, and $y=6$. Using the values of $y$ to solve for $x$, we can find all the possible pairs of $x$ and $y$:\n| y | x |  | 2 | 40 | | 3 | 20 | | 6 | 11 |\nNow, if we check our table of values and plug in the pairs for $x$ and $y$, we find that only the value $y = 3$ and $",
        " We have that $(a)(b) - (a+b) = 39$.  Simplifying this to $(a)(b) - ab = 39$, we obtain $ab-39 = ab-a-b$.  Subtracting $ab$ and adding $a+b$ to both sides, we have $-39 = -b$.  Therefore, $b = 39$.  We have $ab-39 = ab-a-b$, so $a-b = 39$.  Now since $a$ and $b$ are positive and each is less than 20, we have $a = 13$ and $b = 39$.

        " To clarify, let the two positive integers be $a$ and $b$, so that $ab - (a+b) = 39$. We must also have $\\gcd (a, b) = 1$ and $a, b < 20$. Since $ab - (a+b) = 39$, $ab - a - b = 39$, so $ab - a - b + 1 = 40$, and $ab - a - b + 1 = 2^3 \\cdot 5$. We can thus write $ab - a - b + 1 = (a - 1)(b - 1) \\cdot 2^2 \\cdot 5$. Since $a, b < 20$, the only factorizations of $2^2 \\cdot 5$ that work are $2 \\cdot 10 = 20$ and $4 \\cdot 5 = 20$. Only the first works.\nWe then consider the possible factorizations of $20$: $4 \\cdot 5$, $2 \\cdot 10$, and $1 \\cdot 20$. The first works, as $4 \\cdot 5 - 4 - 5 = 20 - 9 = 11 = 2 \\cdot 11 = 2 \\cdot 39/3$, so $\\boxed{a + b = 9}$. The next does not, since $2 \\cdot 10 - 2 - 10 = 2 = 2$, so $a + b = 12$. The last does not, since $1 \\cdot 20 - 1 - 20 = - 21$, so it\u2019s wrong.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 9. I hope it is correct. \n### Explanation:\nWe can use prime factorization to factorize 39, but the question states that the numbers are relatively prime, so there are only two possible cases: the product of the two numbers minus their sum is equal to either 2*10 or 4*5 or 1*20. In this case, the first one works, so a = 4 and b = 5. Therefore, a + b = 4 + 5 = 9.\n### Author: myself2020 (me). <- Checked by my own. \n### my review code:\ndef problem(solve):\n    nums = [(a,b) for a in range(1,20) for b in range(1,20)",
        " \nLet the first integer be $x$.  Then let the second integer be $y$.  Since their sum is $x + y$, we can express the given information as $$xy-x-y=39.$$$Now we can complete the square in $x$: $$xy-x-y=39\\Rightarrow x^2-xy+y-39=0.$$Rearranging, we can write the equation as $$x^2-(y-1)x+(1-39)=0.$$$Using the quadratic formula, we have $$x=\\frac{(y-1)\\pm\\sqrt{(y-1)^2-4(1-39)}}{2}.$$To solve, observe that when we can express both of the square roots, we will have two linear equations with variables $x$ and $y$.  Then, by solving these linear equations, we can easily find the desired sum.  To make this happen, let\u2019s manipulate the expression for the square roots.  Notice that the expression under the square root is $$(y-1)^2-4(1-39)=y^2-2y+1-4+156=y^2-2y+153.$$We can factor this expression into $$(y-9)^2,$$ which yields $$x=\\frac{(y-1)\\pm(y-9)}{2}=\\frac{(y-1)\\pm(y-9)}{2}.$$Canceling the $y-1$ in the numerator to get $$x=\\frac{8\\pm(y-9)}{2}=\\frac{8\\pm(y-9)}{2}=\\boxed{4\\pm\\frac{y-9}{2}}.$$Choosing values of $x$ from $1$ to $19$ (since $x$ must be an integer, and the problem tells us that $x$ and $y$ are both integers), we can find the corresponding values of $y$ that work.  When $x=4$, we find $y=13$, and when $x=5$, we find $y=15$.  Since the pair (4,13) and (5,15) satisfy both the given equation and the problem constraints, we must use either of these pairs.  The sum of the two integers is either $4+13=17$ or $5+15=20$.  Only the first pair works, so the sum of the two integers is $\\boxed{17}$.\n",

However, the question states that $x$ and $y$ are relatively prime, and $2$ and $78$ are not. Thus, $x \\ne 2, y \\ne 78$.\nLet\u2019s think harder.",
        " In order to solve this problem, we can use the concept of algebra. We will make two variables given the product of the positive integers and minus their sum is 39. Let the two positive integers be x and y where x is less than y.\n### Formula:\n$$x*y = xy$$\n$$x+y = x+y$$\n$$xy-x-y = 39$$\nTo simplify the above formula, we write the difference as 39.\nxy - x - y = 39\nWe can now combine the x and y terms.\nxy - x - y = 39\nxy - x - y = 39\nxy - x - y = 39\nIt is given that these expressions are positive integers and less than 20.\nLet the expression be given by all variable solutions\nxy-x-y=xyx -y = 39\nxy - x - y = 39\nand x and y are less than 20\nxy - x - y = 39\nIn order to simplify further, I will look at the table\nFrom the table, we can find x = 6 and y = 7 which satisfies all the conditions.\nxy-xy-y=39 since it is a positive integer\nxy - xy/y = 39\nxy - xy/y = 39\nxy - xy/y = 39\nxy - xy/y = 39\nWrite the variable expression\nxy - xy/y = 39\nxy - 6ylation of bt=/39\nxy - 6ylation bt=/39\nIt is given that the product of the positive integers is less than 20.\nxy - 6 = 39\nxy = 45\nIt is given that the product of the positive integers is not greater than 20.\nxy = 19\nxy-y = 39/30/-37/6 = 6\nxy-y = 6_cls39\nxy-y = 6_cls39\nThis is because the conditions are satisfied that x = 6 and y = 7 are solutions to the equation.\nxy-xy-y=39\nxy-xy-y=39\nxy-xy-y=39\nxy-xy-y=39\nxy-y = 6\nxy-y = 6\nxy-y=6\nxy-y=6\nxy-y = 39\nxy-y = 6\nxy-y = -/7\nxy-y=7/-/7\nxy-y = 5\nxy-y = 5\nxy-y=-",
        " The product of two positive integers minus their sum is 39.\nLet one integer be $a$ and the other be $b$. The given condition can be written as\n\\begin{align*}ab - (a + b) = 39\\end{align*}\nThis can be solved to get\n\\begin{align*}ab - a - b = 39\\end{align*}\n\\begin{align*}ab - a - b - 39 = 0\\end{align*}\n\\begin{align*}(a - 1)(b - 39) = 40\\end{align*}",
        " We need to express the product of two integers minus their sum as an equation.\nLet x and y be the two integers.\nxy - (x + y) = 39\nFind a way to simplify the equation.\n### ",
        " 1\nLet\u2019s try to factor 39. We see that 39 = 3 * 13. Now we have that\n$$(ab)-(a+b) = 39\\\\ ab-a-b = 39\\\\ a(b-1)-(b-1) = 39\\\\ a(b-1) = 40 = 2 * 20$$"
