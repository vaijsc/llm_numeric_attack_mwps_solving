        " \nThe suggested approach is to plug in $2x=4$, and then solve for $y$. Also, we can make sure of our work by plugging in $x=2$ into the equation given.\nWe start with given information that $y=3f(2x)+1$.\nSince $(4,7)$ is on the graph of the equation, by plugging in 4 for $2x$, we can solve for $f(4)$: \\begin{align*}\n7&=3f(4)+1\\\\\n6&=3f(4)\\\\\nf(4)&=2.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, the functional value of $f(x)$ at $x=4$ is 2.\nNow we set up an equation from the given equation by plugging in 4 for $2x$: \\begin{align*}\ny&=3f(2(2))+1\\\\\ny&=3f(4)+1\\\\\ny&=3(2)+1\\\\\ny&=7\\\\\n3f(2x)+1&=7,\n\\end{align*}Now, we can set up an equation for $f(x)$: \\begin{align*}\nf(x)&=\\frac{y-1}{3}\\\\\n&=\\frac{7-1}{3}\\\\\n&=\\frac{6}{3}\\\\\n&=2.\n\\end{align*}Now that we have found $f(x)$, we can plug it into $y=f(x)$ to find a point on the graph: \\begin{align*}\ny&=f(x)\\\\\ny&=2\\\\\n\\Rightarrow(2,2) &\\text{is a point on the graph}.\n\\end{align*}We are asked to find the sum of the coordinates of the point, which is \\boxed{4}.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 4. I hope it is correct.  Let\u2019s think step by step.\n### ",
        " \nThe key step is writing the equation in the other variable:\n$$y + 1 =3f\\left(2x\\right).$$Now, if there is a point (a,b) on the graph of y = f(x), then we can plug in this point to the equation:\n$$b+1 = 3f\\left(2a\\right).$$Now, we are given that (4,7) is on the graph of y = 3f(2x) + 1. Therefore, this point must satisfy the equation:\n$$7 + 1 = 3f\\left(8\\right).$$This means that f(8) = 2. And the problem asks what is the sum of coordinates of that point that must be on the graph of y = f(x). Therefore, the point is (4,2), which gives sum as 4+2 = 6. Therefore, the sum is 6. Final Answer: The final answer is 6. I hope it is correct.  You can also use substitution method. Let y = f(x) be the equation. Then we have y = f(x), y = 3f(2x) + 1.\nWhen we plug in (4,7) we get 7 = 3f(2*4) + 1, then we get f(8) = 2.\nThen we can plug in f(8) = 2, and get 7 = 3(2) + 1 => 7 = 7.\nTherefore we know f(2x) = f(2*4) = 2. Then we get f(x) = f(2*2) = 2. Then when we plug in f(x) = 2 and get x = 2 and y = 2.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 4. I hope it is correct.  Let f(x) be the function. It\u2019s given that (4,7) is on the graph of 3f(2x)+1. Therefore, 3f(2*4)+1 = 7. Simplifying this equation, we get 3f(8)+1 = 7. Subtracting 1 from both sides, we get 3f(8) = 6. Further simplifying this equation, we get f(8) = 2. This implies that f(2) = 2. Hence",
        " Our goal is to express the $y$-coordinates in terms of the same variable and same $f(x)$, and then solve for the point. The equation of $y=3f\\left(2x\\right)+1$ tells us that\n $$7=3f\\left(2\\cdot4\\right)+1=11+3f(8).$$We can rewrite the equation to obtain:\n $$f(8)=1.$$\nNow, we can describe that point, in terms of $f(x)$ as follows:\n $$\\left(x,f(x)\\right)=\\left(\\ldots,f(8)\\right)=(\\ldots,1).$$\nThe point $(x, y) = \\boxed{(8,1)}$ is on the graph of $y=f(x).$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is (8,1).

        " $y=f(x)$ must have $(2x,3y-1)$ as its point.\nSo, we get: $2x=4$, So $x=2$ and also $y=7$. So $(x,y) = (2,7)$. Hence the sum of coordinates is $2 + 7 = 9$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 9. I hope it is correct.  Let me know if I made any mistake. Thanks for asking me to verify. =)\nLet\u2019s go through the steps again.\nLet $(4, 7)$ be on $y = 3f(2x) + 1.$ Then $$7 = 3f(2 \\cdot 4) + 1\\Rightarrow 6 = 3f(8)\\Rightarrow f(8) = 2.$$We need one point on $y = f(x)$ that has a corresponding point on $y = 3f(2x) + 1.$ The $x$-value for that point must be such that $2x = 8,$ so the $x$-value must be 4. Hence $y = f(4) = f(8)\\frac{1}{2} = 2\\frac{1}{2}.$ Therefore, the point $\\boxed{(4, \\frac{5}{2})}$ is on $y = f(x).$\nNow let me clarify something more I made from given points $y=3f(2x)+1$ is a scaled and shifted function of the original $y=f(x)$. It's basically a stretch ($3$-times), shift of $1$ up.\nFinal Answer: I hope now my response is correct. We need one point on y = f(x) that has a corresponding point on y = 3f(2x) + 1. The x-value for that point must be such that 2x = 8, so the x-value must be 4. Hence y = f(4) = f(8)2 = 2 . Therefore, the point (4, 2.5) is on y = f(x). Hence, the sum of coordinates is 4 + 2.5 = 6.5.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 6.5. I hope it is correct. Please let me know if I made any mistake.
