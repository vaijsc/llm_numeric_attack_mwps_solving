        " Since this problem is giving away two points of a circle, which make it easier to figure out the circle\u2019s center and radius, and since we know that the equation of the circle is in general form and we have two points.\n   So, let\u2019s try to use one of the given points, let\u2019s say $A(-1,1)$, to find the center and the radius of the circle. To do this, we can use the following formula: $(x-c)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$, and plug in the given point, $(-1,1)$, like so:\n$$[x-(-1)]^2 + [y-1]^2 = r^2 \\\\ x^2-2x+1+y^2-2y+1=r^2$$\nWe can now see that our equation for the circle is not written in this form, but we can still use this method to help us obtain our desired form. We can rewrite our equation to be in the form $(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$ by completing the square. We will do so first by isolating $x$ and $y$, and then we will translate $x$ and $y$ separately.\n   $x^2-2x+1+y^2-2y+1=r^2$ $x^2-2x+y^2-2y+2=r^2+2$ $(x^2-2x+1)-1+(y^2-2y+1)-1=r^2+2$ $(x-1)^2+(y-1)^2=r^2+2$\nBy comparing this with the formula $(x-c)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$, we can now identify that the center of the circle is $(1,1)$. Note that $(1,1)$ is given in the problem. Now that we know the center of the circle, we only need to find the radius. However, we are given the distance of the other point, $(1,2)$, from the center. This gives us another value, $r+1$.\n   Since the distance from $(1,1)$ to $(1,2)$ is $r+1$, we can set up an equation to solve for $r$:\n$$[(1-1)^2+(2-1)^2]^{1/2}=r+1 \\\\ \\",
        " We first write the equation of a circle passing through points $(-1,1)$ and $(1,2)$. To do this, we use the formula: \\begin{align*}\n(x-a)^2+(y-b)^2&=r^2,\n\\end{align*}where $(a,b)$ is the midpoint of these two points, that is, at the point $\\left(-\\frac{0}{2}, \\frac{1+2}{2}\\right)=(0,1.5)$. Plugging this value into the equation, we obtain\n\\begin{align*}\nx^2-2x+1.25+y^2-3y+2.25&=r^2\\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow\\qquad x^2+y^2-2x-3y&=(r^2-1.5).\n\\end{align*}This is a circle centered at $(a,b)=(0,1.5)$ with radius $r=\\sqrt{1.5}$. But another center of this circle is $(1,1-\\sqrt{1.5})$, and therefore the equation of the circle is:$$\nx^2+y^2-2x-3y+\\left(1-(\\sqrt{1.5})\\right)(x+1)+1.5(1-\\sqrt{1.5})=0\n\\Leftrightarrow\\qquad x^2+y^2-2x-3y+\\sqrt{5}(x+1)-1=0$$Then, we have $A=1, B=-2, C=-3, D=-1$, so the answer is $A+B+C+D=\\boxed{-5}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -5. I hope it is correct.  So the answer is A+B+C+D=-5. Therefore, the final answer is -5.  Does anything seem off about this answer? I'm not not sure if this is correct. I just know that the answer is 0, because of the symmetry. By symmetry the sum of the distances of the center of the circle to the center of the points, from both direction, are equal. The sum of the x-distance and the y-distance of the center of the circle from the point $(1,2)$ is equal to the sum of the x-distance and the y-distance of the center of the circle from the point $(-1,1)$.

Therefore, $A+B+C+D=1+2-2-1=\\boxed{0}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 0. I hope it is correct.  I'd be happy to help with this process or review anywhere in this problem.

We will substitute the values of the points into the equation of the circle and solve for $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$.\nStep 5: Find A+B+C+D\nOnce we know the values of $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, we can find the sum $A",
        " We can find the radius of the circle using the distance formula. Call the center of the circle $(x_c,y_c)$. The radius is $r$, so $$(x_c+1)^2+(y_c-1)^2=r^2$$and also $$(x_c+1)^2+(y_c-2)^2=r^2$$We can subtract the two equations to cancel out $(x_c+1)^2$ leaving $$(y_c-1)^2-(y_c-2)^2=0$$or $$(y_c-1+y_c-2)(y_c-1-y_c+2)=0$$This simplifies to $$(2)(-1)=-2$$which is a true statement, so we can conclude that $y_{c}-1=-y_{c}+2\\Rightarrow 2y_{c}=3\\Rightarrow y_{c}=3/2$. Since $(x_c+1)^2+(y_c-2)^2=$$r^2$, we can now write$$x_{c}^2+(3/2-2)^2=r^2$$since$y_c=3/2$and$(x_c,y_c)$is the center of the circle. Taking the root of both sides,$r^2=x_{c}^2+(1/2)^2\\Rightarrow r=\\sqrt{x_{c}^2+1/4}$. We are also given the coordinates of a point on the circle, (1, 2).

        " A First let's find the center of the circle. We know that the center of the circle is the point that is equidistant to both points $(-1,1)$ and $(1,2)$. So if we use the distance formula on both of these points, we get the following two equations: $$\\sqrt{(-1-x)^2+(1-y)^2}=\\sqrt{(1-x)^2+(2-y)^2}.$$ Simplifying both sides, we get $$x^2-y^2-4x+1=y^2-2x-2y+5.$$ Since the left hand and right hand sides should be equal, we get our equation: $$\\boxed{x^2-y^2-4x+1=y^2-2x-2y+5}.$$ Now we can simplify this into our required form by expanding out into a quadratic equation. We have\n\\begin{align*}x^2-y^2-4x+1&=y^2-2x-2y+5\\\\\nx^2 -4x&=y^2+2y+4\\\\\nx^2-4x+y^2+2y+4&=0\n\\end{align*} So in the new given form we have $A=1$, $B=-4$, $C=2$, and $D=4$, and so $A+B+C+D=1-4+2+4=\\boxed{3}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 3.

        " The equation for the circle is x^2+y^2-2x+2y+1=(x-1)^2+(y-1)^2. Combining, we have x^2-2x+y^2+2y=(x-1)^2+(y-1)^2. Then, removing the right side, we have x^2-2x+y^2+2y-(x-1)^2-(y-1)^2=0. Factoring the left side, we have (x-1)^2+(y-1)^2-2x+x^2+2y+y^2=0. Distributing the right side, we have -2x+x^2+2y+y^2+(x-1)^2+(y-1)^2=0. Combining like terms, -2x+x^2+2y+y^2+1=0. Then, expanding the right side, x^2+y^2-2x+2y=0. A, B, C, and D in the expression x^2+y^2+bx+cy+d=0 can be retrieved by setting: A=1, B=-2, C=2, and D=0. Then, summing, A+B+C+D=(1)+(-2)+(2)+0=1-2+2=1. Alternately, we can follow the flow. The vertex (-1,1) of this circle is (1,1) units from the origin. Thus, the equation of this circle is of the form (x-(-1))^2+(y-1)^2=r^2, where r is the radius. Plugging the vertex coordinates in and solving for r, we obtain 1=(1-(-1))^2+(1-1)^2=r^2, and thus r=2. Thus, the equation of this circle is (x+1)^2+(y-1)^2=4. Combining, we have x^2+2x+y^2-2y=4. Then, moving all terms to the left side, x^2+y^2+2x-2y-4=0. Thus, x^2+y^2+2x-2y-4=0, and A, B, C, and D are the same values as before. Final Answer: The final answer is 1. I hope it is correct. "
