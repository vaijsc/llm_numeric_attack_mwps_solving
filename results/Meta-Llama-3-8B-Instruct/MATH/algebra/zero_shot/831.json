I hope it is correct. \nEdit: \nThe star notation is used above as follows: $(3+5)5$ is denoted as $3 \\star 5$, as per the instruction. The star notation is not the common mathematical operation. It can be thought as \"extract\" the result between the parentheses to combine with the left operand. The meanings of both star operations, $a\\star b$ and $b\\star a$, are the same. However, the result of the two operations are different if $a$ and $b$ are different, Generally, if a\\star b and b\\star a are different, the star operation \\star is non-commutative. In this problem, the star operation \\star is neither commutative nor associative. They can not be easily reorganized into a standard mathematical expression for easier computation. \nIn the problem, the question is asking $(3\\star5) - (5\\star3) = ((3+5)5)-((5+3)3) = 40-24 = 16$, which is the answer. The answer will be different if the question is asking $(3\\star2) - (2\\star3)$, for example. The answer is $10-8=2$, not 16. The star operation \\star is not a standard mathematical operation because of the reasons mentioned in the problem statement. The answer to the problem depends on how we interpret the star notation, not on any properties of the standard mathematical operations. It is possible that different answers can be obtained by applying the star operation to different sets of numbers. The information given in the instruction is not enough to determine all the properties of the star operation \\star. It can be used as a mathematical tool for specific problem, but it's not a useful mathematical operation in general, in this context. At the end, the problem is about solving a simple mathematical problem, not creating a new mathematical operation or analyzing its properties. The environmental",

Solution: Let's define the operation by a*b=(a+b)b. So, a*5=(a+5)5. Now, let's calculate 3*5 and 5*3. We have, 3*5=(3+5)5=8*5=40. Similarly, 5*3=(5+3)3=8*3=24. Now let's calculate 35 and 53. We have, 35=3*5=40 and 53=5*3=24. Finally, we get, (35)-(53)=40-24. = 16. So, (3*5)-(5*3)=16. Hence, the required output is 16. Final ANSWER: The final answer is 16. I hope it is correct. My ",
