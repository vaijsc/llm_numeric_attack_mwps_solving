        " $\\sqrt[3]{4^5+4^5+4^5+4^5} = \\sqrt[3]{4^5(1+1+1+1)} = \\sqrt[3]{4^5\\cdot4} = \\sqrt[3]{4^{6}} = \\boxed{4}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 4. I hope it is correct. Let us know if you have any other questions. Anyone else see how that works? We just distributed the 4 outside the parentheses by multiplying each of the four terms by 4: $4^5(1+1+1+1) = 4^5\\cdot4$. Then, we applied the power rule, combining the five 4\u2019s on the three\u2019s term and then combining the four 4\u2019s on the 1\u2019s term: $4^5\\cdot4 = 4^{5+1} = 4^6$. So we finally used this standard exponent rule: $a^{m+n}=a^ma^n$ to rewrite the 4\u2019s in terms of a single six: $4^6$. Then we can simply write the answer as $\\sqrt[3]{4^{6}} = 4$.

        " $$\\sqrt[3]{4^5+4^5+4^5+4^5}$$\nWe are asked to simplify the expression. Simplifying the expression is the process of simplifying the expression by making the numbers we have in the expression less complicated.\nThe number in the exponent is 5. We can simplify like so $\\left(4^5+4^5+4^5+4^5\\right)$ by simplifying the expressions and finding a common term. We can simplify the expression by dividing all terms by $4^5$ and getting $1+1+1+1$ which equals 4.\nThis means our expression is equal to $\\sqrt[3]{(1+1+1+1)\\cdot 4^5}$. Simplifying it more, we have $4^5\\cdot\\sqrt[3]{1+1+1+1}$. 4^5 becomes $1024$. $1+1+1+1$ becomes 4. $\\sqrt[3]{4}$. Now we get $\\sqrt[3]{1024}$ which equals $4$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 4. I hope it is correct.  It was funny trying.  I hope you have a good day.
