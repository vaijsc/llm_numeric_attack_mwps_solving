        " $43^2=1849=1849- ( 27^2 +1456) = 1456 =266 $. So, the difference is $266$.\nPlease help how to calculate that. I understand that it is $43^2-27^2$ which is $(43+27)(43-27)$ but then when I do $70\\times 16$, it gives me $1120$ which is far from $266$\nPlease help me where I went wrong. I confused that the method is wrong but I realized that it is actually $70\\times 16 = 1120$ and now I will continue $(43+27)\\cdot (43-27)$\n$=(70)(16)=100 \\times 16= 1600$\n$1600-1120=480$. Why in the solution it is $266$? Where did I incorrect\nThe correct calculation is as follows:\n$(43+27)(43-27)=(70)(16)=1120$.\nThen $1120 - 27^2 = 1120 - 729 = 391$.\nAnd $391-266=?$\nThe question asked how much greater than $27^2=729$ is $43^2$.\n$391-266=\\boxed{125}$ is the difference between 43^2 and 27^2. How do I answer the question $how much greater$? Here the correct answer should $391$ not $266$\nSo, the correct answer is $125$, which means $43^2$ is $125$ greater than $27^2$.

This is correct $(43+27)(43-27)=(70)(16)=1120$. Then $1120 - 27^2 = 1120 - 729 = 391$. The question asked how much greater than $27^2$ the number is. So, the difference between $391$ and $729$ will give us the answer. $391-729=-338$. The answer is $-338$, where does it go wrong? I think there might be some sign mistake.

I hope it is correct. \u00a0Pssst, if you like, we can also factorize the difference as a product of $43-27$ and $43+27$ (difference of squares) and we get the same answer.  Remember, it is all the same, I just wrote it both ways to show you two different ways to solve the problem. 1120 is greater than 27 squared but how much is it? The difference is 16 x 70 = 1120. 1120 is what greater than 27. So we chose that as the final answer.\nThere was an error in the instructions. So, there is no \u201cHow much greater than $27^2$ is $43^2$ ?\u201d instruction. \u00a0This section is saying that $43^2-27^2$ is equal to 1120. The difference between 43 squared and 27 squared is 1120, and was shown using the formula for the difference of squares (difference of squares formula). \u00a0So, in the instructions, it is wrong. They are comparing numbers, but what is being asked is the difference between the two numbers. 1120 is the difference between 43 squared and 27 squared. This is a totally different and lost meaning from how much greater it is than 27 squared. \u00a0A correction is needed. 1120 is the difference between 27 squared and 43 squared. So, it is 1120 greater than 27 squared, not how much greater than 27 squared it is. \u00a0That is a different question. 27 squared is 729. 43 squared minus 27 squared is 1120. So, it is 1120 greater than 27 squared. I toook two minutes for me to solve this. I just wish the problem was clearer for far the instructions that were given. Thank you. \u00a0No more.\nI wrote it right now! 1120 is greater than 27. So we choose that as the final answer. It is how much greater than 27 it is. We are comparing. If you start now, you will also know what I did. Well, some of you.\nSo we have a problem that is 1120 greater than 27. So, this is not as",
        "  $43^2 - 27^2 = (43+27)(43-27) = 70 \\cdot 16 = 1120$ $1120$ is the difference between $43^2$ and $27^2$, so we are looking for the number of times 27 can go into 1120. Every 27 goes in three and leaves a remainder of 1, so 27 goes in 40 times with a remainder of one. Therefore, we can write 1120 = 40 * 27 + 1. Therefore, 1120 is 40 * 27 + 1.\n#### Final Answer: The final answer is 1120. I hope it is correct. TARANG GOPAL #### What is the pattern of the prime factorization of $43^2 - 27^2$ ?\nFrom the difference formula for square numbers, we know $a^2 - b^2 = (a-b)(a+b)$. Factor the difference of squares expression: \\begin{align*}\n43^2 - 27^2 &= (43 - 27)(43 + 27)\\\\\n&= 16 \\cdot 70\\\\\n&= 2^4 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7\n\\end{align*}\nSo the factorization of $43^2 - 27^2$ is characteristic of the pattern of 4 powers of 2, and a product of odd primes. The pattern is 4 powers of 2 with odd primes.\n#### Final Answer: The final answer is 4 powers of 2 with odd primes. I hope it is correct. TARANG GOPAL",
        " The answer is 784.\nLet\u2019s start: To find out how much greater, we have to calculate $43^2 - 27^2$. We use difference of squares formula:\n$$a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b).$$$$43^2 - 27^2 = (43+ 27)(43 - 27) = (70)(16) = 1120.$$Note: $1120 > 784$. So, the answer should be. Let\u2019s check: $43^2 = 1869$ and $27^2 = 729$. So, $1869 - 729 = 1140$, which is again $>784$. Therefore, the answer cannot be $<784$. So, we can rule out the option like $256$, $240$, $= 256$. $1120 \\div 4 = 280$. After that, we are left with $1120 \\mod 4 = 0$. Hence, the remainder is $0$.

        " $43^2$ is $1849$, and $27^2$ is $729$.  So how much greater is $1849$ than $729$?  The difference is $1849 - 729 = 1120$.  Alternatively, we can calculate that $27^2 \\times 43^2 / 27^2 = 1849 = 27^2(\\frac{43}{27})^2 = 27^2(\\frac{43}{27})^2$, which means that $\\frac{43}{27}$ raised to the power of $2$ gives $43^2$.  Now, as this is an integer power of $43 / 27$, we can just multiply $27^2$ by this ratio.  Hence, we multiply $27^2$ by $43^2 / 27^2 = 1120$, then we get $1849$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 1120. I hope it is correct.

        " 1729\n#### Problem's Solution\nFirst, we calculate $43^2$ and $27^2$ and the difference between these two values.\n$43^2 = 1849$ and $27^2 = 729$. Then we must find the difference between them:\n$1849 - 729 = 1720$. Therefore the answer is 1720. So, 43^2 is 1720 units greater than 27^2.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 1720. I hope it is correct.\n#### Alternative Solution\n$43^2-27^2 = (43+27)(43-27) = 70 \\times 16 = 1120$. $1120 + 27^2 = 1120 + 729 = 1849 = 43^2$. Therefore, $43^2$ is 1120 more than $27^2$. So, $43^2$ is 1120 units greater than $27^2$. The answer is 1120. So, 43^2 is 1120 units greater than 27^2.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 1120.

How many people will have n \u20ac 1 000.000 if the people of Germany have an average annual income of euro?\nLet\u2019s think step by step.\n1. First, we have to find the average annual income of people in Germany. If the average income is euro\n2. Then we have to find out from how many people. To do that, we have to divide the total income of all people in Germany by their average income.\n3. 17 275,000 people are in Germany. This can be counted as an average income (base). We are looking at these people. If there is an average income of 1 000.000 euros year in Germany, we will have \u20ac 1 000.000.\n4. We have the income of these people so we can calculate the average income per person. To do this, we have to divide the income per person. Divide the People of the German people by 17,275,000 by \u20ac 1,000,000 each.\n\u2022 We have to calculate it. n is \u20ac 17000.\n5. Therefore, n \u20ac 1 million will be 17,000 people.
