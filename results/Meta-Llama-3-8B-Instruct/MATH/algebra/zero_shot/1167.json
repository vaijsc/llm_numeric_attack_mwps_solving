Correct me if I am wrong.\n### Explanation of the final answer:\nEven though we are not asked to reduce our answer to its simplest form, reducing $a$ to its simplest form gives us $a = 1$.

Again using the first equation, we have $\\log x - 22 = a$, and therefore $\\log x = a + 22$.  Since we know that $x$ is positive, we know that $a + 22 > 0$.  Similarly, since we know that $y$ is positive, we can use the fact that $22 > 0$ to conclude that $y$ is also positive.  Therefore, we know that $\\log y = 22$ and that $y > 0$.  Using this and the fact that $x > 0$, we can simplify the statement: $$\\log y - \\log z = 15$$to read $$\\frac{\\log y}{\\log z} = 16.$$The logarithms are defined so that the base of the logarithm is not specified, and therefore we can solve this equation by raising each side to the $8^{th}$ power.

Then, we replaced $y$ with $ze^{15}$ and $z$ with $xe^{-7}$ to get $x=xe^9$.\nAs $x$ is nonzero, equality holds when $e^9 = 1$, and so $e^9 = e^0$, implying that $x=1$, $y = e^{24}$, and $z=1$. Since $x=1$, we find $\\log x - \\log y = -23$, so $a=\\boxed{15}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 15.

A nice question about logs! \ud83d\ude42 The three given equations are in terms of logarithmic expressions of three variables, each set equal to other values (i.e. some real numbers $a$, 15, and -7). Let\u2019s solve each one individually, beforehand. First one: \\[\\log x-\\log y=a\\]To simplify, we can write this as $$\\log\\frac{x}{y}=a.$$Since $a$ is a constant, we can take its reciprocal if we would like (which it seems logical to get $y/x$, not $x/y$, given $a$ is negative). We can also use rules of exponents and logarithms to conclude that $\\boxed{10^a=x/y}$. Moving on to the next one, we have \\[\\log y-\\log z=15\\]Much the same, we use the rules of logarithms to find\n$$\\log\\frac{y}{z}=15.$$Using the same idea as before, since $15$ is positive, we can write\n$$10^{15}=y/z.$$The last one:\n$$\\log z-\\log x=-7.$$Using the rules of logarithms, as\n$$\\log\\frac{z}{x}=-7.$$This time, taking the reciprocal of both sides, we get\n$$10^{-7}=\\frac{x}{z}.$$Now, for the benefit of clarity, I will express the variables in terms of one another (using exponentials and reciprocals). Using this, we can express our first equation in terms of $y/z$ since it is already there. $$10^a=\\frac{x}{y}=10^{-15}.$$Using this division property, then, we can equate $10^a$ and $10^{-15}$ (we can change $a$ and $-15$ to relate them) to conclude that $\\boxed",

Thus, $\\dfrac{x}{y} = 10^a$. We now square both sides to get $\\dfrac{x^2}{y^2} = 10^{2a}$. Also, for any real number $b$, we know that $10^{2\\log b} = b^{2}$. Thus, we have $\\dfrac{x^2}{y^2} = (10^a)^2 = 10^{2a}$. To solve for $x$ and $y$, we let $y = x t$, where $t$ is a non-zero real number. We then get $\\dfrac{x^2}{(xt)^2} = 10^{2a}$, which simplifies to $\\dfrac{1}{t^2} = 10^{2a}$. By definition of logarithm, $t = 10^{-a}$.

        " We are given three equations:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\log x - \\log y &= a, \\\\\n\\log y - \\log z &= 15, \\text{ and} \\\\\n\\log z - \\log x &= -7.\n\\end{align*}We can define: $x = e^{\\log_ze^{\\log ye^{\\log xy}}} = e^{( \\log z + \\log x )} =e^{\\log z^x},$ so, $\\log z^x = \\log ze^{(\\log y+\\log x)} = \\log z^{xe}.$\nSimilarly,\n$y = e^{\\log_e zxe^{(\\log x + \\log y)}} = e^{(\\log x + \\log y)} = e^{\\log xy}$\nNow, from the conditions given, we know:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\log z^x &= z15, \\\\\n\\log xy &= y 15, \\\\\n\\log z^x &= -x7 \\\\\n\\end{align*}Let\u2019s substitute z15 for $\\log z^x$ and y15 for $\\log xy$ is the equation 1. So, the above three equations will be:\n\\begin{align*}\nz15 &= -x7, \\\\\n15 &= y 15, \\\\\n15 &= -x7 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\nComparing the second and third equation, we see $15$ cancels out on both sides to get:\n$$yu = x7$$Then this combined with:\n$$-x7 = z15$$We can substitute $x$ to get:\n\\begin{align*}\nyu &= 7z15 \\\\\nyu &= -z(105) \\\\\nyu &= -105(z y)\n\\end{align*}Therefore, we have $y$ and $u$ both equal to the same. Considering second equation, we can see,\n$$15 = y 15$$\nWe can simplify it as y = 1,\nTherefore, $$a = \\log x-\\log y=\\log x-\\log1 = \\boxed{\\log x}$$\nNow we can just use 3rd equation, $\\log x - \\log y = -7$ to solve for log x. $\\log x$ of both sides, dividing them by log y on both sides, using common log to simplify.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is a = log x = -7.
