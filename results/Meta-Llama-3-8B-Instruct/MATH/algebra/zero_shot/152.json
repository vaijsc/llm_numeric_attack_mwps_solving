The sum of the arithmetic sequence can be calculated by $\\frac{(n)(a+l)}{2}$ where n is number of terms, a is the first term, l is the last term and is the common difference, which is also the last term minus the first term.  Then we calculate the sum of the arithmetic sequence 1+2+3+\u2026+80.  The first term is 1, the last term is 80, so the common difference is 1. Now, n is 80. So, we calculate the sum of the arithmetic sequence 1+2+3+\u2026+80, we have $\\frac{(80)(1+80)}{2}=\\frac{(80)(81)}{2}=4080$.  Now, we need to factor the number 4080.

Then, it is written as a product of two factors and finds the prime factorization by finding divisors. This method is unnecessarily long and indirect. A much simpler way to solve this problem is to know that the sum is $\\frac{80\\cdot81}{2}=3420$. So, 3420 is composed of many factors, of which the largest prime factor is 67. This approach is more intuitive and more efficient, and it is also more likely to find errors.\nHere's the correct solution:\nThe sum of 1 to 80 is 80*81/2 = 3420.\nTrying prime factors, we get 3*2*10*19*67.\nSo the largest prime factor is 67.

        " The sums of consecutive integers are triplications of triangular numbers. In particular, the sum of the first $n$ positive integers is $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$. Therefore, the sum of the first $80$ positive integers is $\\frac{80(80+1)}{2}=2,780$. We can factor that into $2^2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 31$, so the greatest prime factor is $\\boxed{31}$. Final Answer: The final answer is 31. I hope it is correct.
