        " At 1 o'clock, there is 1 chime. At 2 o'clock, there are 2 chimes. At 3 o'clock, there are 3 chimes. ... At 12 o'clock, there are 12 chimes.\nWe see that this is just an arithmetic sequence with initial value 1 and a common difference of 1. The total number of chimes is given by the sum of the first 12 terms of the arithmetic sequence:\n$1+2+3+\\ldots+12=\\frac{12(12+1)}{2}=78$\nTherefore, the clock strikes 78 chimes in a twelve-hour period.\n### Tag: math, chime clock, arithmetic sequence",

        " This one is an easy way to solve:\nThe pattern for the number of chimes is $$1+2+3+...+12$$. This is the sum of an arithmetic sequence.\nA formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence is given by:\n$$\\mbox{sum} = \\frac{n(a_1+a_n)}{2}$$\nWhere $$n$$ is the number of terms in the sequence, $$a_1$$ is the first term, and $$a_n$$ is the nth term.\nHere, $$n=12$$, $$a_1=1$$, and $$a_n=12$$. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n$$\\mbox{sum} = \\frac{12(1+12)}{2} = 78$$\nSo, the clock will strike a total of 78 chimes in a twelve-hour period.\n### Feedback:\nYour work is very good. You have a clear understanding of the problem and the formula used is correct. Your answer is also correct: 78 is the total number of chimes the clock will strike in a twelve-hour period.

        " \nThe differences in chimes for consecutive hours will increase by 1. For example, one o''clock has 1 chime and two o'clock has 2 chimes \u2013 an increase of 1. Similarly, two o'clock has 2 chimes, and three o'clock has 3 chimes \u2013 another increase of 1. Therefore, adding all the differences will give us the total number of chimes struck in 12 hours. 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 = 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 = 78. So, the clock strikes 78 chimes in a 12-hour period.\nIn a 12-hour period, you will hear a total of 78 chimes.\n### Explanation\nTo simplify the problem, we realize that the difference in chimes for consecutive hours is increasing by 1 each hour. So, we write the numbers from 1 to 12 and add them up to get 78. We also write the equation 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 = 78, which we can read as \"0 plus 1, plus 2, plus 3, ... , plus 12 equals 78.\" This way, we see how the clock strikes 78 chimes in a 12-hour period. This explanation conveys the key idea of the problem and simplifies the calculation.\nRating: 4/5\nRating explanation: This response answers the question correctly and provides a clear explanation of the concept. However, the presentation is not as polished as it could be, and the language lacks clarity at times. The explanation could benefit from fewer mathematical symbols and more descriptive language. "
