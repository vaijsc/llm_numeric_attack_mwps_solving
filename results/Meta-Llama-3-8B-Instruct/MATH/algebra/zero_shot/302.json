We know that \\frac{a}{b}\\cdot\\frac{b}{c}\\cdot\\frac{c}{d}=\\frac{a}{d}. Let's start by multiplying the numerators and denominators of the first two fractions together: \\frac{3}{5}\\cdot\\frac{5}{2}=\\frac{3\\cdot5}{5\\cdot2}=\\frac{15}{10}. Then, we multiply that result by the third fraction: \\frac{15}{10}\\cdot6=\\frac{15\\cdot6}{10\\cdot6}=\\frac{90}{60}. Simplifying that fraction, we get \\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}. Therefore, the value of \\frac{a}{d} is \\frac{3}{2}, or in simplest form, \\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}. 3 ### Student Explanation: We are given three ratios: $\\frac{a}{b}=\\frac{3}{5}$, $\\frac{b}{c}=\\frac{15}{6}$, and $\\frac{c}{d}=6$. We are asked to find the value of $\\frac{a}{d}$. To do that, we can multiply all of the ratios together. $\\frac{a}{b}\\cdot\\frac{b}{c}\\cdot\\frac{c}{d}=\\frac{a}{d}$ Multiplying the three ratios, we get:",
        "  We know that  \\begin{align*} \\frac ab &= \\frac35 \\mbox{ and } \\frac cd = 6\\\\ \\end{align*}\nCross multiplying this equation, we get $5c=6b,$ so $c=\\frac{6b}{5}$. Using the same method for the other requirement, we have $\\frac bc=\\frac{15}6$, which gives $6b=15c,$ so $b=\\frac{15c}{6}$. Finally, putting these together, we have $c=\\frac{6b}{5}$, or $b=\\frac{15c}{6},$ so $$c=\\frac{6b}{5}=\\frac{6\\cdot\\frac{15c}{6}}{5}=\\frac{15c}{5}$$ Subtracting 1 from both sides, we have $$\\frac{6b}{5}-c=\\frac{15c}{5}-c$$ Simplifying, we get $$c=\\frac{15c}{5}$$ Finally, note that we have to take the reciprocal to calculate $\\frac{ad}.$ The answer is \\boxed{\\frac35\u20226=\\boxed{3}}.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 3.
