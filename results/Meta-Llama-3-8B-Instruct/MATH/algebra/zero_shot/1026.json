Solving this system of equations,\n\\begin{align*}\n9a-3b&=9\\\\\n3a-3b&=-27\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad a&=-6,\n\\end{align*}and from this we conclude that $b=6$.\n### ",

Final Answer: The final answer is 220. I hope it is correct.  The value of $a=2$, $b=4$ and $c=0$ can be obtained from the two given points $(-3,3)$ and $(1,3)$. The given point $(-3,3)$ is easier: \\begin{align*}\n3&=a(-3)^2+b(-3)+0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\quad 9a-3b&=3\\\\\n&\\Rightarrow\\quad 9a-3b+15-15=3-15\\\\\n&\\Rightarrow\\quad 9a-3b=3-15\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\quad 9a-3b&=3-15\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\quad 9(2)-3(4)&=3-15\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\quad 18-12&=-12\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\quad 6&=-12\n\\end{align*}This implies that we have no solution. The value of $c$ is calculated as \\begin{align*}\n0&a\\cdot0+b\\cdot0+c\\\\\n&\\Rightarrow\\quad 0=c\\\\\n&\\Rightarrow\\quad c=0\n\\end{align*}Since we know $b$ cannot be $-3$ because 3 is not equal to $0$. Then we go through the given points and we obtain a solution. Then $a=2$ $b",
        " In this problem, we are given the following:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item The equation of the parabola $y=ax^2+bx+c$\n\\item Three points that lie on the parabola: $(-3,3)$, $(1,3)$, $(0,0)$\n\\end{itemize}\nWe need to find $100a+10b+c$.\n### Step 1: Use one of the given points to express $c$ in terms of $a$ and $b$.\nLet\u2019s choose the point $(0,0)$: $0=a(0)^2+b(0)+c \\Leftrightarrow c=0$.  So, the constant term is zero.\n### Step 2: Use two of the given points to express $b$ in terms of $a$ and $0$ (that is, $c=0$).\nLet\u2019s choose the points $(-3,3)$ and $(1,3)$: \\begin{align*}\n3&=a(-3)^2+b(-3)+0\\\\\n3&=a(1)^2+b(1)+0 \\end{align*}\nSolve these equations simultaneously:\n\\begin{align*}\n3&=9a-3b \\Rightarrow 9a=6b+3\\\\\n3&=a+b \\Rightarrow 6a=6b+3\n\\end{align*}Subtract the second equation from the first one and you can solve for $a$: \\begin{align*}\n3-3&=42a -3b-(6a-3b) \\Rightarrow 3=36a\\\\\na&=\\frac{1}{12}\n\\end{align*}\n- Substitute this value back into the equation $3=6a=6b+3$:\n\\begin{align*}\n3&=6\\left(\\frac{1}{12}\\right)+3\\\\\n3&=1+3\\\\\n36b&=24\\\\\nb&=\\frac{2}{3}\n\\end{align*}\n### Step 3: Find the value of $100a+10b+c$.\n$100a+10b+c$:\n\\begin{align*}\n100a+10b+c&=100\\cdot\\frac{1}{12}+10\\cdot\\frac{2}{3}+0\\\\\n&=8.33+6."
