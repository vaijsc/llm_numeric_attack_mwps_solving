        " \nFor a perfect square, we can represent the square root of the square as a whole number, for example, 1, 4, 9, 16, etc.\nA consecutive perfect square is the difference of two consecutive whole numbers of the square root.\nLet the two whole numbers be n and n+1. Then the square root of the two perfect squares are n and n + 1. Since their difference is 35, we have \nn(n+1)(n+2)=35\nNow, I will try to simplify this equation.\nn(n+1)(n+2)=n^3+3n^2+2n-35\nI will now factorize the quadratic expression on the right-hand side.\nn^3+3n^2+2n-35=0.5*(n+7)(n^2+3n-10)\n[(n+7)]*(n^2+3n-10)=0\nSolving for n+7 = 0 makes n = -7, which is not possible since square roots must be positive. Hence, we need to solve for n^2+3n-10 = 0.\nn^2+3n-10=(n+5)(n-2)=0\nn=-5, 2\nWe cannot have n=-5, as we require positive roots. So, our desired square root is n=2.\nNow, the greater perfect square is the square of 3 (2+1).\n3^2 = 9.",
        " \nStart by expressing the difference between two consecutive perfect squares using algebraic expressions. If the squares are $n^2$ and $(n+1)^2$, their difference is\n\\begin{align*}\n(n+1)^2-n^2&=n^2+2n+1-n^2\\\\\n&=2n+1.\n\\end{align*}Now, we know that the difference between these two squares is 35. Thus, \\begin{align*}\n2n+1&=35\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 2n&=34\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=17.\n\\end{align*}This means that the squares are $17^2=289$ and $18^2=324$. Therefore, the greater of the two squares is $\\boxed{324}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 324. I hope it is correct.### Explanation: The problem asks us to solve a quadratic equation and then determine the greater of the two roots.\n### Final Answer: The final answer is 324. I hope it is correct.### Explanation: The problem asks us to solve a quadratic equation and then determine the greater of the two roots. Let n be a positive integer. If n^2 is a perfect square less than the higher of the two perfect squares, then the difference between the two squares is 2n + 1. Now, since the difference between the two squares is given to be 35, it follows that 2n + 1 = 35 or 2n = 34. This gives us the integer n = 17, which means that n^2 = 17^2 = 289 is a perfect square.\n### Final Answer: The final answer is 324.

        " The positive difference between two consecutive perfect squares is 35. What is the greater of the two squares?\nLet x be the smaller square. Then, (x+1)^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1. Adding 35 to both sides, we get: \n(x+1)^2 + 35 = x^2 + 2x + 36.\nSince the left side of the equation is a perfect square, we know that this is equal to the square of a whole number. Let\u2019s rewrite the right side. \nx^2 + 2x + 36 = (x + 6)^2.\nNow we have: \n(x+1)^2 + 35 = (x + 6)^2.\nComparing the two sides, we see that the difference of the two sides is minimized when x is at its minimum. So, let\u2019s substitute x = 0 into the two expressions: \n(1)^2 + 35 = 0^2 + 36.\nSimplifying, we get: \n36 = 36.\nThis looks good, so let\u2019s try x = 1, which gives us: \n2^2 + 35 = 1^2 + 38.\nUh, not so good. But, let\u2019s try x = 2. This gives us: \n3^2 + 35 = 2^2 + 44.\nOkay, let\u2019s calculate the above equation. 9 + 35 = 44, so this works. \nSo, x = 2 is the minimum. Therefore, the smaller square is 4, and the larger square is: \n(4 + 1)^2 = 5^2 = 25.",
