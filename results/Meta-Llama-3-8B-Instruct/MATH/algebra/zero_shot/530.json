        " The question says there are 4 numbers, $a,b,c,d$, that are in increasing order and they form an arithmetic sequence.

Similarly, the question says $a,b,d$ form a geometric sequence, which means $\\dfrac{b}{a}=\\dfrac{d}{b}=r$.

Now, $c = a + (c-a)$, so using the previous formula, $c = a + c-ar$ which simplifies to $c = ar$. Therefore, $a = c/r$ and $d = ar^2 = (c/r)r^2 = c$. $a/(c/d) = a/d$. This makes sense.
