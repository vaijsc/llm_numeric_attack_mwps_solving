Write $-840$ as\n$$-840=-35(-24)$$and consider polynomial\n$$(x+24)(-35)=-35x-840=-(21x^2+11x+40).$$It seems that if $x \\neq 4$, then the given polynomial is the product of $(x+24)$ and $-35$. Therefore, substitute values of $x$ into the polynomial and observe values of $(x+24)(-35)$:\n\\begin{array}{c|c|c}\nx & 0 & 3 & 4 \\\\\n\\hline\n(x+24)(-35)={}&0 & 105 & 0\n\\end{array}It is evident that for $x = 4$, we have $(4+24)(-35) = 0$.

        " \n1. To solve for $x$ in $0 = -21x^2 - 11x + 40,$ we first add $21x^2$ to both sides of the equation to get $21x^2 = -11x + 40.$\n### Text: \n2. Next, we add $121x/4$ to both sides and subtract $40$ from both sides to get the following: $$21x^2 + \\frac{121}{4}x = 40$$$$\\frac{1}{4}(4)(21x^2 + \\frac{121}{4}x) = \\frac{4}{4}\\cdot40$$$$\\qquad84x^2+121x=160$$\n### Text: \n3. Now we can subtract $160$ from both sides: $$84x^2 + 121x - 160 = 0.$$We can then apply the quadratic formula to find the roots: $$x=\\frac{-121\\pm\\sqrt{121^2-4\\cdot84\\cdot(-160)}}{2\\cdot84}$$\n### Text: \n$$x=\\frac{-121\\pm\\sqrt{14641+26880}}{168}=\\frac{-121\\pm\\sqrt{41521}}{168}$$\n$$x=\\frac{-121\\pm 203}{168}$$\n### Text: \nNow we can find the two solutions.

        " \nTo solve for $x$, we can subtract $40$ from both sides of the equation to obtain $0 = -21x^2 - 11x + 40 - 40$, which becomes $0 = -21x^2 - 11x$.  Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by $-21$ to obtain $0 = x^2 + \\frac{11}{21}x$.  We can treat this as a quadratic equation in $x$ and use the quadratic formula to solve.  The quadratic formula tells us that $$x = \\frac{-\\frac{11}{21} \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{121}{441} - 1}}{2} = \\frac{-11\\pm \\sqrt{121-441}}{21 \\cdot 2}.$$The expression $\\sqrt{121-441}$ evaluates to $\\sqrt{-320} = 8i$, so we have $$x = \\frac{-11\\pm 8i}{21\\cdot2} = \\boxed{\\frac{-11}{42}\\pm \\frac{i}{7}}.$$Both solutions lie on the imaginary axis, and the given restriction $x>0$ is not satisfied.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\frac{-11}{42}\\pm \\frac{i}{7}.

        " We can factor the quadratic equation. Firstly, we find its discriminant $\\Delta = b^2-4ac$. $b = -11$ and $c = 40$. Therefore $\\Delta = 121+784 = 905$. Since $\\Delta$ is larger than 0, the equation has two real solutions. Now we can find two factors of $c=40$ with sums $-11$ as follows. First, we note that $8$ and $5$ are factors of $40$, and $8+5 = 13$ and $8-5 = 3$ are either both greater than $-11$ or both less than $-11$. Thus, we can write $40 = 8 \\cdot 5 + 3(-11)$, and therefore $40 = 8x^2-11x+5$, where $x$ is the other factor. Simplifying further, we get $0 = -21x^2 - 11x + 40 = -(x-4)(21x + 10)$, from which we can solve $x-4 = 0$ or $21x + 10 = 0$, resulting in $\\boxed{x = \\frac{4}{21}}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is x = \\frac{4}{21}.
