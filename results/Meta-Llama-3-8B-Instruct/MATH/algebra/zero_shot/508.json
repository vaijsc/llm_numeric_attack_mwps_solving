Then the distance AB is \\sqrt{(x-1)^2+(y-2)^2}. We are given that AB=5.  Hence \\sqrt{(x-1)^2+(y-2)^2}=5.\r\n\r\nWe can square both sides of the equation: $(x-1)^2+(y-2)^2=25$.  This gives a circle with radius 5 and center (1,2).\r\n\r\nWe can solve for y: $y-2=\\pm \\sqrt{25-(x-1)^2}$\r\n\r\nNow, we are given that (4,b) is a point on this circle or AB.  Hence, we substitute x=4 into the equation.  This gives $b-2=\\pm \\sqrt{25-(4-1)^2}$.\r\n\r\nSimplifying, we get $b-2=\\pm4$.  Solving for b, we get $b=2\\pm4$.\r\n\r\nHence, b= 2+4=6; 2-4=-2.
