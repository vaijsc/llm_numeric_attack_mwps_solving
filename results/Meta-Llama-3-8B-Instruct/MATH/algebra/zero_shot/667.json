This is because we take the square root from both sides, and then we have\n$$6y+2=50\\cdot2y$$\nThis equation is equivalent to\n$$2y=48$$\nwhich is equivalent to y = 24.

By doing so, they convert an expression with radicals into one with the same denominator. This makes it easier to analyze, because it is now an expression in terms of a rational number, and this property allows to bring out the common denominator.

I hope it is correct.\tEquating the integrand to $2c$, we have 2y\\left(6y+2\\right)=5\\left(2y\\right) 4y(6y+2)=25y  We simplify as follows: 2y+8y=25y 12y=25y 12y-17y=0 y=\\frac{17}{24} Final Answer: The final answer is \\frac{17}{24}. I hope it is correct. Assume y=0 or 17/24. Attributes the set of instructions provided. We get\n### ",
        " $$\\frac{\\sqrt{6y+2}}{\\sqrt{2y}}=\\frac52.$$ Squaring both sides gives: \\begin{align*} \\frac{6y+2}{2y}&=\\frac{25}{4} \\\\ 6y+2&=\\frac{25}{2} y \\\\ 12y+4&=25y \\\\ 4-25y&=-12y \\\\ 0&=y(-25)+4 \\\\ y(-25)+4 &=0 \\\\ y (-25)+4 &=0 \\\\ y &=\\frac{-4}{-25} \\\\ y &=\\frac{4}{25} \\end{align*} Thus, answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{4}{25}}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\frac{4}{25}. I hope it is correct.unned from response from other user.

        " After simplifying the given equation, we get $\\sqrt{\\frac{3y+1}{y}}=\\frac52$. Squaring both sides, we get $\\frac{3y+1}{y}=25$ and then $3y+1=25y$. Thus $y=-\\frac46$. However, we know that $y$ must be positive as it is present under a radical. Therefore, our desired solution is $\\boxed{y=\\frac16}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is y=\\frac16. I hope it is correct. There might be the negative value of y, but we are looking for the positive one.\n### Source/Link:\nIt seems like you are using the Unacademy platform and this is a practice question.
