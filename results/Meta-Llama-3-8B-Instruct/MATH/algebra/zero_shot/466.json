Hint: a two-pound cake is 10 times a one-third-of-a-pound cake, so two five-pound cakes are 20 times a two-pound cake.  Let's learn how to make a cake | The recipe for a two-pound cake requires 1.5 cups of flour, so for two five-pound cakes, you'll need 20 times that amount of flour, or 20 x 1.5 = 30 cups of flour. That's a long time. **A five-pound cake** is equal to **10** times a **two-pound cake**. So two five-pound cakes are equal to **20** times a two-pound cake.\nSo, if a two-pound cake requires 1.5 cups of flour, two five-pound cakes require **20** cups of flour.

        " It\u2019s a great job! I will help you to solve the problem step by step.\nLet\u2019s first understand that one pound cake requires 1.5 cups of flour. So, for two pound cakes, you will need 2 x 1.5 = 3 cups of flour.\n#### Step 2: Two five-pound cakes\nNow, we need to calculate how much flour needed for two five-pound cakes. Five pounds is equivalent to five times two pounds. So, you will need 5 x 1.5 = 7.5 cups of flour for five pounds of cake. Since you need two five-pound cakes, multiply 7.5 cups by 2: 7.5 x 2 = 15 cups.\n#### Step 3: The answer\nWe have the answer. You need 15 cups of flour for two five-pound cakes.

For the first cake, we have $\\frac{0.5}{1} * 2$ = $1$ cup of flour. Now, how many cups are needed for the second cake? Again, that requires two pounds of flour, so $\\frac{0.5}{1} * 2$ = $1$ cup of flour. But we need this for the second cake, not the first. So now we have $1 + 1$ = $2$ cups of flour. And we\u2019re not done yet, because we need these amounts for two cakes, not one. So we have $2 + 2$ = $4$ cups of flour needed for the cakes.\n### Thinking like a scientist.

We're asked to find the number of cups for two five-pound cakes. Let's start by finding the number of cups needed for one five-pound cake. The recipe needs $\\frac{1.5}{2}$ cups of flour per pound, so we have the number of cups of flour for one five-pound cake. The number of cups of flour for five pounds is $\\frac{1.5}{2}$ * 5. Now we need the number of cups of flour for two complete five-pound cakes. That means we need $\\frac{1.5}{2}$ * 5 * 2. So the number of cups of flour needed for two five-pound cakes is $\\frac{1.5}{2}$ * 5 * 2. Next time, if someone asks you how many cups are needed for two five-pound cakes, you could simply multiply $1.5$ by $5$ by $2$ and get $15$ cups. Multiply the recipe by the number of cakes, and the product is the number of cups you need. When you multiply, simply follow the order of operations, and you'll get the answer.

        " The number of cups needed for 1 pound cake is equal to 1.5 / 2 = 0.75 cups. The number of cups needed for 5 pound cakes is 5 x 0.75 = 3.75 cups. The problem says that we need to know how many cups are needed for 2 five-pound cakes, which means that we need to multiply 3.75 cups by 2. So, the answer is 3.75 * 2 = 7.5 cups.\n</br>",
        " You must double, double, double for bigger cakes. Since a five-pound cake is roughly 10 times a two-pound cake in volume, you must multiply 1.5 cups by 10 to get the cups of flour for the five-pound cakes. And that is 15. So for two five-pound cakes, you must take the 15 * 2. So the answer is 30",
        " If we let $f$ denote the amount of flour (in units of cups) needed for a two-pound cake, we are given that\n$f=1.5$.\n### So, for one five-pound cake, we need\n$f_5=f=1.5$, as shown by the green arrow in the diagram below.

        " If a recipe for a two-pound cake requires 1.5 cups of flour, then the flour requirement per pound of cake is 1.5 / 2 = 3/4 cups. So for a five-pound cake, the flour requirement is 5 * (3/4) = 15/4 = 3.75 cups. For 2 five-pound cakes, the flour requirement is 3.75 * 2 = 7.5 cups.\nExplanation: This problem can be solved by finding the flour requirement per pound of cake and then scaling up by the number of pounds in the multiple cakes.",
        " Let's see if the same proportion is applied. \"five pounds is twice as much as 2 pounds\" (you can double a 2-pound cake). \"And twice of 1.5 cups is 3 cups\" (you can double 1.5 cups).\nThe same proportion must be applied, and it will need 3 cups for 2 five-pound cakes. Yes, the same ratio is applied when you need to find the proportion. So if there are 2 five-pound cakes double times the flour It will need.\nI hope it helps, dear. Let me know if you have any other question.\n### CIDEPV.: Consider the phrase \"the same ratio is applied when finding a proportion\".\n### Explanation: I used the sentence \"the same ratio is applied when finding a proportion\" to show that when doubling the quantity of flour (from 2 pounds to 2 times 5 pounds), the same proportion should be applied and the quantity should be doubled.\nThe negative test, where I showed that the same amount is not used to double 1 pound cake, and 2 cakes require twice as much flour as 1 cake, implies that when doubling cups of flour, the proportion should remain the same, and the amount should also be doubled.\nI hope it helps, dear. Let me know if you have any other question.",
        " First, we know the recipe requires 1.5 cups of flour for 2 pounds of cake. The two-pound cake is just twice as large as one pound.

        " \nEach cake requires: 2 lb / 1 cake = 2 lb/cake = 2 pounds / 2 pounds / (2 cups/1 pound) = 2 cups/cake. \nTotal amount needed = 2 cakes * 2 cups/cake = 4 cups.  Therefore, if a recipe requires 1.5 cups of flour for a 2-pound cake, how many cups are needed for a 5-pound cake? That is, for 5 cakes? \nFirst, notice that if a 5-pound cake is like 2-3 cakes, it should take 3 x 1.5 = 4.5 cups of flour. But remember we are divided into 2 pairs. Therefore, you need to double it. It must be divided by 2. 4.5 cups / 2 = 2.25 cups. \nIn other words, you can calculate the number of cups needed for 2 five-pound cakes by multiplying the number of cups needed for a 2-pound cake by 4 (2 x 2 = 4). So the number of cups needed for 2 five-pound cakes is 1.5 cups x 4 = 6 cups. \n#### Final Answer: \nThe correct answer is 6 cups. You may have to double the weight of your cake when using this rule, as you have a 5-pound cake. Give it a try and verify it. \n#### \nI hope it helps you. If you have any questions or need further explanations, please let me know. \nYou are welcome! \nIn conclusion, the answer is 6 cups. Multiply the quantity of 1.5 cups by the number of cakes, which is 4 in this case (2 cakes x 2). The result is 6 cups, indicating that you need 6 cups for 2 five-pound cakes. \nPlease let me know if you have any further questions. I am here to help. \nBonus. The hint is to double the length of the recipe. Yes, 1.5 cups times 2 makes 3 cups. Three cups are needed for a 5-pound cake. Two 5-pound cakes would need 3 cups times 2, which is 6 cups. \nThis is a two-step solution. Double the original recipe, and then double the result. This tells you that the increased volume of the cake doubles the amount of flour needed. \nI hope this bonus helps you understand the concept. Please",
        " A 2 pound cake requires 1.5 cups of flour. So a 5 pound cake requires 3 * 1.5 cups of flour. A 2 five-pound cake will require 2 * (3 * 1.5 cups) of flour. So 6 cups of flour are needed for 2 five-pound cakes.",

        "  Since 2 five-pound cakes will be equal to 10 pounds of cake, and this is four times the amount of 2 pounds, we multiply the amount of flour required for 2 pounds by 4.\n### Explanation:\n#### \u00a0Step 1: Find the amount of flour required for 10 pounds:\nThe given formula states that for a 2-pound cake, 1.5 cups of flour is required. \u00a0Let the amount of flour required for 10 pounds be x.\nInitially, the given information only stated the amount of flour required for 2 pounds. \u00a0To find the amount of flour required for 10 pounds, we need to know the amount of flour required per pound. \u00a0Divide the amount of flour required for 2 pounds by 2 to find the amount of flour required per pound:\n1.5 cups / 2 pounds = 0.75 cups per pound\n#### \u00a0Step 2: Find the amount of flour required for 10 pounds:\nThe formula is set up with this information:\n0.75 cups per pound * 10 pounds = x\n0.75 * 10 = x\n7.5 cups = x\n#### \u00a0Step 3: Find the required amount of flour for 2 five-pound cakes:\nThere are two five-pound cakes, which equals 10 pounds. \u00a0The amount of flour required for 10 pounds of cake is 7.5 cups. \u00a0Multiply the amount of flour required for 10 pounds by half since there are two five-pound cakes:\n7.5 cups * 0.5 = 3.75 cups\nSo, 3.75 cups of flour are required for 2 five-pound cakes.
