        "  Since the center of the circle is on the $x$-axis, it must satisfy the equation $x=k$, for some number $k$. Furthermore, the radius $r$ must be the distance from the center $(k,0)$ to one of the two points $(x_{1},y_{1})$ or $(x_{2},y_{2})$.  By the distance formula, we can express the radius as $r = \\sqrt{(x_{2}-k)^{2}+y_{2}^{2}} = \\sqrt{(k-2)^{2}+3^{2}}.$  Doing the same for the other point, we have $r = \\sqrt{(x_{1}-k)^{2}+y_{1}^{2}} = \\sqrt{(k+3)^{2}+2^{2}}.$  We need to solve these two equations in the two variables, $k$ and $r$.  Since we know that both expressions are equal to $r$, we can equate the two expressions and solve.  We then find that $r = \\sqrt{(k+3)^{2}+2^{2}}=\\sqrt{(k-2)^{2}+3^{2}}\\Rightarrow (k+3)^{2}+2^{2}=(k-2)^{2}+3^{2}\\Rightarrow k^{2}+6k+9=2k^{2}-4k+13\\Rightarrow k^{2}-10k+4=0.$  Using the quadratic formula, we can find that $k = \\frac{10\\pm\\sqrt{100-16}}{2}=\\frac{10\\pm\\sqrt{84}}{2}$.

Now, let\u2019s look at the distance formula:\nDistance between the two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is \u221a((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2).\nNow, let\u2019s make use of this formula to find the distance between the two given points:\nDistance between (-3, 2) and (-2, 3) = \u221a((-2 - (-3))^2 + (3 - 2)^2) = \u221a((1)^2 + (1)^2) = \u221a1 + 1 = \u221a2.\nSo, the distance between (-3, 2) and (-2, 3) is \u221a2 units.\nNow, we know that this distance is also the distance between the center point and the given points.
