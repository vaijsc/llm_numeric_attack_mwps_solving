The range is a set so it is denoted with set notation. \nNote that $f(x)=\\sqrt{x^2}$, and the range of $f(x)$ cannot include negative values since $\\sqrt{x^2}$ is always non-negative. Also, since the square root function maps all real numbers $x$ to non-negative numbers, the range will always include 0 since $f(0)=\\sqrt{0^2}=\\sqrt{0}=0$. \nWe must think of all positive real numbers, since $f(x)=\\sqrt{x^2}$ includes all positive numbers. Since $f$ can take on any positive real number, the range is $\\boxed{[0,\\infty)}$.",

The square root of this parabola then produces a function that is a half-open interval graphed on the $y$-axis.  The minimum value of $f$ is $0$, the value that the function attains at $x=0$.  As $x\\to\\pm\\infty$, the function approaches $+\\infty$.  Thus, the range is $(0,\\infty).$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is (0,\\infty). I hope it is correct. |",

We know that $\\sqrt{x^2} \\ge 0$ for all real numbers $x$, so we can conclude that the lowest possible output of $f(x)$ is $0$.\nNext, let\u2019s think about the rest of the range. We need to find the maximum value of $\\sqrt{x^2}$, which we can do by remembering that $x^2 \\ge 0$ for all $x$, so $x^2 = a^2$ for some $a \\ge 0$.\nSo, we have that $\\sqrt{x^2} = \\sqrt{a^2} = |a|$, so $\\max f(x) = |a|$. As $a$ can take any nonnegative value, we can see that $f(x) = \\sqrt{x^2}$ can output any real number from $0$ to $\\infty$.\nTherefore, the range of the function $f(x) = \\sqrt{x^2}$ is $\\boxed{[0, \\infty)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is [0, \\infty).

However, we could interpret this problem in a real-world context to better understand its implication. \nFor instance, if this function represents the height of an object, where $x^2$ is the horizontal distance from the origin, then the range of the function would represent the maximum height that the object could achieve. Therefore, the range of this function can have practical implications, such as the tallest building or the highest altitude that an aircraft can reach.\nAnother way to see this in real-world context is to consider that $f(x) = \\sqrt{x^2}$ is also known as the Euclidean norm of vectors. In many applications, the range of such functions is crucial, like in physics, engineering, or computer graphics, where the magnitude of vectors is important. For example, the Euclidean norm of the velocity of an object could determine its speed, which is essential for understanding its motion.\nSo, while the question might seem abstract, it can have significant implications in various real-world contexts where understanding the range of a function is crucial.",

        " To compute the range of the function $f(x) = \\sqrt{x^2}$, we need to analyze the domain of the function first. Since $\\sqrt{x^2}$ is defined for any $x$ in the real numbers, we start with $-\u221e$ as the lower bound of the domain.\nNow, we need to examine the upper bound of the domain.\nFor $x/post/sample/Frome QC, f(x) = \\sqrt{x^2} = |x|$ since squaring any real number will always yield a non-negative number. Since the input of f(x) is an absolute value, it means that x can either be positive or zero. Therefore, the upper bound of the domain is +\u221e.\nNow that we have the domain, we can find the range of the function by setting up a simple inequality.\nSince x can be any real number (positive or negative), let\u2019s set the domain as -\u221e \u2264 x \u2264 \u221e.\nNow, to find the range, we need to analyze the output of f(x) = |x|.\nFor positive values of x, f(x) = x, which is greater than or equal to zero.\nFor negative values of x, f(x) = -x, which is greater than or equal to zero.\nTherefore, the range of f(x) is also the same as the range of |x|, which is the interval [0, \u221e).",
        "  The range of $f(x)$ is $\\boxed{[0,\\infty)}$.\nSince the function $f(x) = \\sqrt{x^2}$ is the square root of $x^2$, for nonzero values of $x$, $f(x) = x$ whenever $x\\ge 0$ and $f(x)=-x$ whenever $x\\le 0$. This means that as long as $x$ is nonzero, the output of the function is always nonnegative. Moreover, when $x = 0$, the output is also 0.\nIn other words, for all possible values of $x$, $f(x)$ is either 0 or a positive real number. Thus, the range of the function is $[0,\\infty)$.

So $\\sqrt{x^2} \\ge 0$, meaning that the function will never take on negative values; we start at 0 and move up.",
        " To find the range, we need to first analyze the behavior of the function on the domain (the set of real numbers in this case) and then determine the image (the set of all possible output values) according to which the range is defined.\nThe domain of the given function is R = (\u2013$\\infty$, +$\\infty$) since $\\sqrt{x^2}$ is defined for all real numbers.\nWe know that the square root operation always gives non-negative values for non-negative arguments. Similarly, it gives negative values for negative arguments.\nTo obtain the range of f(x) = $\\sqrt{x^2}$, we will have to find the largest and the smallest value of y = $\\sqrt{x^2}$.\nFor the largest value, we have\n$\\sqrt{x^2}$ = $\\sqrt{x^2}$ when x is at its largest. But the square of the largest value (say $x_1$) is $x_1^2$, so we get \\begin{align*}\n    \\sqrt{x_1^2} &= x_1\n\\end{align*}Thus, the largest value is x_1. Now, we look for the smallest value of $\\sqrt{x^2}$. It occurs when x is at its smallest.\nThe square of the smallest value (say $x_2$) is $x_2^2$, so we have\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sqrt{x_2^2} &= x_2\n\\end{align*}Thus, the smallest value is $x_2$. Therefore, we have two bounds:\n\\begin{align*}\nx_2 &\\le \\sqrt{x^2} \\le x_1 \\\\\n    0 &\\le \\sqrt{x^2} \\le x \\quad \\text{since $x_2 = 0$ and $x_1 = x$}\n\\end{align*}We see that the range of the function $\\sqrt{x^2}$ is [0, $\\infty$) because the range is always at least 0 and there is no greatest possible value.\nTherefore, the range of the function f(x) = $\\sqrt{x^2}$ is [0, $\\infty$). If you want, we can find the set A where f(x) = $\\sqrt{x^2}$ is equal to its least upper bound and least upper bound will give us the largest value of $\\sqrt{x^2}",

It is always defined for all real $x$. So, the domain is $\\boxed{(-\\infty,\\infty)}$.\n### Step2: Simplify $f(x)$\nTo simplify $f(x)$, we can squre both sides to get rid of the square root:\n$$f(x) = \\sqrt{x^2}$$\n$$f(x) = |x|$$\nSo, $f(x) = |x|$.\n### Step3: Find the Minimum and Maximum Value\nThe minimum value of $f(x)$ is achieved when $x = 0$, which is equal to $f(0) = |0| = 0$, and the maximum value is the positive part of the absolute value, which is $\\boxed{\\infty}$ for $x \\to \\infty$.\nSo, the range of the function is $\\boxed{\\mathbb{R}^+}$, where $\\mathbb{R}^+$ is the positive real numbers.

        " Given the function $f(x) = \\sqrt{x^2}$, which represents the square root of $x^2$, we can find the maximum and minimum values of $f(x)$ in order to find its range.\nNow, let\u2019s start finding the maximum value of $f(x)$.\nLet\u2019s look at the value of $f(0) = \\sqrt{0^2} = \\sqrt{0} = 0$.  Now, let\u2019s find the value of $f(x)$ when $x$ is positive: $f(x) = \\sqrt{x^2} = x$.  When $x$ is positive, we can see that the value of $f(x)$ is greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to $x$.  Since the range of $x$ is $\\infty$, the range of $f(x)$ is also $\\infty$, and we need to find the minimum value of $f(x)$.  Let\u2019s look at the value of $f(0) = \\sqrt{0^2} = 0$.  Now, let\u2019s find the value of $f(x)$ when $x$ is negative: $f(x) = \\sqrt{x^2} = -x$.  When $x$ is negative, we can see that the value of $f(x)$ is greater than or equal to $-x$ and less than or equal to 0.

Here is one way:\nWe know that the range of $f(x)$ will be entirely above the $x$-axis because $f(x)$ is always nonnegative. We know that it will be entirely above the $x$-axis because the square root function is always nonnegative.\nIf $x$ is positive, then $f(x)$ will be positive. And if $x$ is negative, then $f(x)$ will be positive too. This means that the range will be entirely above the $x$-axis.\nAlso, the maximum value of $f(x)$ will be reached when $x$ is positive and is as large as possible. In this case, the value of $x$ is infinite, and so the maximum value of $f(x)$ is infinite. Therefore",
