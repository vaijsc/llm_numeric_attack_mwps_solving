        " \nWe will start by looking at the speed of the motorcycle. In 1 hour, Bob can travel $m$ miles, and the speed of the motorcycle is $\\frac{m}{h}$ miles per hour. If Bob travels $n$ hours, he can travel $n \\cdot \\frac{m}{h}$ miles. We know that at this rate, Bob can travel $h$ miles in $n$ hours, so we have $n \\cdot \\frac{m}{h} = h$. In order to reduce this equation until we can see that it is more familiar, we can write $n$ to one side and multiply both sides by $h$. When $n \\cdot \\frac{m}{h} = h$, $n \\cdot \\frac{m}{h} \\cdot h$ goes across the equal sign. The left hand side becomes $n \\cdot m$, and the right hand side becomes $h \\cdot h$. So now the equation is $n \\cdot m = h \\cdot h$. Then, we go from $\\sqrt{n \\cdot m = h \\cdot h}$ to $n \\cdot m$ to $\\sqrt{(n \\cdot {m})}^2$ equals $\\sqrt{(h \\cdot h)}^2$. Now we have $n \\cdot m = h \\cdot h$ to $\\left(\\sqrt{n \\cdot m}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\sqrt{h \\cdot h}\\right)^2$. In algebra, if there are two equal terms, we have to take square root of both sides with a 2 to solve for at a time. Since $\\sqrt{(n \\cdot {m})} = \\sqrt{(h \\cdot h)}$, we get $m \\cdot h = h \\cdot h$. So that $m \\cdot h = h \\cdot h$, or $m = h$ is the answer we need.

I came across this question and attempted to solve it based on my understanding of \"necessary and sufficient\" conditions. Can anyone please\nendorse my response? So, we know that, based upon the information given, there exists an inverse proportionality between distance traveled and times taken. That is, there exists a constant $k$ such that $m = kh$. This allows us to find $t$ by applying the inverse relationship. Thus, the equation we want becomes $ht = m$. So, we get $t = \\boxed{\\dfrac{m}{h}}$.
