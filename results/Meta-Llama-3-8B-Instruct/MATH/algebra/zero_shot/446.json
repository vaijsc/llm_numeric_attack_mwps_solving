        " \nThe domain of function $f$ is all real numbers, if the function $f$ is defined for all real numbers, i.e., if its denominator is not zero for all real numbers. This is equivalent to $x^2-x+c\\neq0$. Since we are in the problem from Intermediate Algebra (where there are no extraneous solutions), we need to find the smallest integer value of $c$ such that the quadratic polynomial $x^2-x+c$ doesn\u2019t have any real zeroes, and thus, it is always $\\neq0$.\nBy Vi\\etheta\u2019s formula for quadratic equations, we know that\n$x=\\frac{1\\pm\\sqrt{1-4c}}{2}=\\frac{1\\pm\\sqrt{1-4c}}{2}$.\nThe function $x^2-x+c$ has no real zeroes when $1-4c\\leq0$, i.e., when $c\\geq\\frac14$. Thus, the smallest integer value of $c$ is $\\boxed{1}$.\nNote: In particular, $x^2-x+1=(x-\\frac{1}{2})^2+\\frac{3}{4}$. By completing the square, we have written $x^2-x+1$ as the sum of a perfect square and a positive constant. Since this expression is always positive, so is the expression under its square root, and we can see that $1-4c=\\frac{3}{4}$ when $c=1$. In particular, since $1-4c=0$ when $c=\\frac14$ and $1-4c$ is an increasing function of $c$, we can see that $x^2-x+c$ has no real zeroes when $c\\geq\\frac14$. Thus, the smallest integer value of $c$ is $\\boxed{1}$.\nIn fact, $c$ could be a non-integer value in which case, we have:\nLet\u2019s note that it is possible that $1-4c\\leq0$ for integer values of $c$. When $1-4c=0$ then, we have that $c=\\frac14$ and since $1-4c$ is a decreasing function with respect to $c$, we can see that $1-4c$ is $<0$ when $c\\leq\\frac14$, hence the function $x^2-x+c",
        " \nThe domain of $f(x)$ consists of all real numbers $x$ such that the function is not undefined. However, the function is undefined when the denominator is 0. Therefore, we can write the domain as $$\\operatorname{dom}(f)=\\{x\\in\\mathbb{R}\\mid x^2-x+c\\neq0\\}.$$Now, we need to find the smallest integer value of $c$ such that $\\operatorname{dom}(f)=\\mathbb{R}$.\nLet\u2019s suppose $x^2-x+c=0$ has no real solutions. So, it has no real roots, which means its discriminant $(x^2-x+c)^2 \\ge 0$ is strictly greater than 0 for all real values of $x$. But, we have\n$$(x^2-x+c)^2 = (x^2-x+c)(x^2-x+c) = x^4 -2x^3+ (c^2 + 1)x + c^2,$$which means that the discriminant is at most $(c^2+1)^2 > 0$, and this equation has at least one real root. Therefore, the smallest integer value of $c$ such that $x^2-x+c=0$ has no real solutions is $c=\\boxed{2}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2. I hope it is correct.  ### Solution: The quadratic formula gives the solutions to $x^2-x+c=0$ are $x=\\frac{1\\pm\\sqrt{1-4c}}{2}$. When $c=0$, the solutions are $x=\\frac{1\\pm\\sqrt{1}}{2}$, that is, $x=\\frac{1\\pm1}{2}$. Therefore, for $c<0$, the function $f(x)$ has a hole at $x=1$, so the domain does not include 1. However, we need the domain to include all real numbers. Hence, the value of $c$ must be greater than or equal to 0. For $c>0$, the function $f(x)$ has 2 real roots, and so the domain is the set of real numbers excluding the roots. The smallest value of $c$ such that the function $f(x)$ has a domain of all real numbers is $c=\\boxed{2}$.  Final Answer: The",

        " \nAfter rewrting the given function as \n$$f(x) = 1+\\frac{1-x}{x^2-x+c}$$\n it is clear that the function has a vertical asymptote at $x=\\frac{1\\pm\\sqrt{1-4(1)(c)}}{2}$, and hence this must be the only possible vertical asymptotes. Hence, $$1-4(1)(c) \\le 0 \\Rightarrow c \\ge \\frac{1}{4}.$$ Now, consider the case when $x$ approaches $\\frac{1+\\sqrt{1-4(1)(c)}}{2}$ from the right.

This is a contradiction since we know $f(x)$ is not equal to $0$ for any real value of $x$. This implies that $c$ must be smaller than $\\frac{1}{4}$.\nHence, the smallest integer value of $c$ such that the function $f(x)$ has a domain of all real numbers is $\\boxed{0}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 0.

        " This is a Calculus problem and not a Graph Theory problem \nThe given problem states that you need to find the smallest integer value of c such that the function f(x) has a domain of all real values. We can simplify the function f(x) to get rid of the fraction:\n    f(x)=(x^2+1)/(x^2-x+c)\n    f(x)=(x^2-x+c+1)/(x^2-x+c)\nNow, we can consider the denominator of f(x), which is\n    x^2-x+c\nFor f(x) to have a domain of all real numbers, the denominator must never be equal to zero. Otherwise, the function would not be defined for those values of x.

Let\u2019s calculate the discriminant in order to determine if the quadratic equation has real solutions:\n    Discriminant=b^2-4ac\n    Discriminant=(-1)^2-4(c)(1)\n    We want the discriminant to be less than or equal to zero.\n    -1-4c <= 0\n    4c+1 >= 0\n    4c >= -1\n    c >= -0.25\nNow, we know that the quadratic equation x^2-x+c=0 has no real solutions if c >= -0.25. Hence, the smallest integer value of c for which the function f(x) has a domain of all real numbers is c= -0.",
        "First, if $f(x)$ has a domain of all real numbers, we will require the denominator $x^2-x+c$ to not be equal to zero for all $x$. Therefore, we need to make sure the roots of $x^2-x+c$ are complex. We can factor $x^2-x+c$ as $$x^2-x+c=(x-r_1)(x-r_2),$$where $r_1$ and $r_2$ are the roots of $x^2-x+c$. For this quadratic polynomial, we know $r_1+r_2=1$, since the coefficient of the $x$ term is $-1$, and $r_1r_2=c$, since the constant term is $c$. Therefore, $r_1r_2=c$ implies that the imaginary part of $r_1$ and $r_2$ must be zero, so $r_1=a$ and $r_2=a-1$ for some real number $a$. In this case, we have that $c=r_1r_2=a(a-1)$. In order for the roots to be complex, we need that $a$ is not equal to $1$. In other words, $a$ must be either less than or greater than $1$. Since $a(a-1)$ must be a positive real number, we must have that $a$ is either less than or greater than zero. Therefore, the smallest possible value of $a$ is $a=2$, so $c=a(a-1)=2(2-1)=\\boxed{2}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2. I hope it is correct.",

        " $c=1$.\n### Explanation:\nIn order for $f(x)$ to be defined for all real values of $x$, we must ensure that the function is not undefined for any real values of $x$.  Since $f(x)=\\frac{x^2+1}{x^2-x+c}$, $f(x)$ would be undefined if either the numerator or denominator were zero.  The numerator is $x^2+1$, so the numerator is not zero for any real value of $x$.  The denominator is $x^2-x+c$, which might be zero for some values of $x$ if $c$ is not equal to $1$.

The second root is undefined if $\\frac{1-\\sqrt{1-4c}}{2}$ is a real value, i.e., if $1-4c\\le0$, which, in turn, gives $c\\ge\\frac{1}{4}$.

In other words, there is no input that makes the function not make sense.\n### First step: we have to find the places in the domain where the function is not defined (namely, where it's undefined). To do this, we have to make sure that the denominator is not zero.\n### At this point, we need to use the trick: make the denominator = 0 first.\n### From our knowledge, we know that when $x^2-x+c=0$, the solutions to the equation are $x=\\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1-4c}}{2}$, because by completing the square, we get $x=\\frac{1\\pm\\sqrt{1-4c}}{2}$ by factoring.\n### For this function to make sense, our solutions have to be real numbers. Therefore, $1-4c\\geq 0$. In other words, $-4c\\geq-1$, which implies $c\\leq \\frac{1}{4}$. Therefore, $c> \\frac{1}{4}$.\n### There is another step: this function also becomes undefined on the numbers printed out in the orange word. These numbers are $x$ values. Combined with our work above, it means we cannot have $x^2=\\lfloor x\\rfloor$ as values. In other words, $\\lfloor x\\rfloor^2\\neq x^2$, or $x^2-\\lfloor x\\rfloor^2\\neq0$.\n### In algebra, we write the solution to this function as $$x^2-\\lfloor x\\rfloor^2=(x-\\lfloor x\\rfloor)(x+\\lfloor x\\rfloor)$$\n### Remember that in this case, we are working with intervals. $\\lfloor x\\rfloor$ is the floor function of $x$.\n### We find that the expression above is equal to 0 when either $x-\\lfloor x\\rfloor=0$ or $x+\\lfloor x\\rfloor=0$.\n### When $x-\\lfloor x\\rfloor=0$, we obtain that $\\lfloor x\\rfloor=x$. On the other hand, $x+\\lfloor x\\rfloor",
        " Suppose that $x^2+1=(x-\\alpha)(x-\\overline{\\alpha})$ where $\\alpha$ is a complex number. This identity will work out nicely. So, $x^2+1=x^2-x+\\alpha x+\\overline{\\alpha} x-\\alpha\\overline{\\alpha}\\Rightarrow 1=\\alpha x+\\overline{\\alpha} x-\\alpha\\overline{\\alpha}\\Rightarrow 1=i\\alpha-i\\overline{\\alpha}\\Rightarrow 2i\\alpha=-1+i\\overline{\\alpha}\\Rightarrow \\alpha=-\\frac{i}{2}+\\frac{\\overline{\\alpha}}{2i}$ Thus, \\begin{align} \\alpha+\\overline{\\alpha} &=i\\alpha-\\overline{\\alpha}i=-\\frac{1}{2}\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\quad2\\alpha\\overline{\\alpha}&=1\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\quad\\alpha\\overline{\\alpha}&=\\frac{1}{2}\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\quad c&=\\alpha\\overline{\\alpha}=1/2. \\end{align} Therefore, the smallest integer value of $c$ for which the numerator has no complex zeros is $\\boxed{1}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 1. I hope it is correct. hm #### Problem: Find all values of $c$ for which the equation $f(x)=\\frac{x^2+1}{x^2-x+c}$ has a domain of all real numbers, where $f(x)$ is the function on the right side of the above equation. #### Problem: A common theme in calculus is that a function is defined as a quotient, and the domain of such a quotient always consists of all real numbers unless the denominator is zero at some values of $x$. Let\u2019s see if this happens to be the case with $f(x)$. If we set the denominator equal to zero and solve for $x$, we obtain\n\\begin{align} x^2-x+c&=0\\\\ x^2-x+\\frac{1}{4}&=c-\\frac{1}{4}\\\\ \\left(x-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2&=\\frac{1}{4}-c\\\\ \\left|x-\\frac{1}{2}\\right|&=\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}-c}\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\quad\\frac{1}{2} \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}-c}&="
