        " \nWe find the domain of $f$ by first solving the expression in the first radical for the term under the square root.

I hope it is correct.  Let me know. I will be happy to help you if you need any further assistance.  Thank you.\n### Explanation: \nThe first step is to determine the domain of the function. To do this, we need to solve the expression $x^2-16$ for terms under the square root sign.\nLet $y=x^2-16$.  Because $y$ is a positive value, we have $y>0$.  Solving for $x$, we have\n$$x^2>16$$\nThe inequality $x^2>16$ implies that $x>4$ or $x<-4$.\nNext, we find the domain of the expression $\\sqrt{x^2-16}-3$.  Once again, we need to solve for terms under the square root sign.  We have\n$$x^2-16>9$$\nSimplifying this equation, we have\n$$x^2>25$$\nThe inequality $x^2>25$ implies that $x>5$ or $x<-5$.\nIn conclusion, the domain of $f$ is $(5,\\infty)$.\n### Remark: \nNote that if $x\\in(-\\infty,-5]\\cup[5,\\infty)$, then $\\sqrt{x^2-16}$ is defined, but when we evaluate $f$, we find that the value under the smallest radical, $x^2-16$, is negative, making $f(x)$ undefined.  Therefore, $f$ is only defined for $x>5$.",
        " The expression under each radical must be non-negative (otherwise we would be finding the square root of a negative number). Also, the inner square root cannot have zero as a solution.\nSo we know that $\\sqrt{x^2-16}>0$. Squaring both sides we get $x^2-16>0$, so $x^2>16$, and $x>\\sqrt{16}>0$ or $x<-\\sqrt{16}<0$.\nThe inner square root cannot have zero as a solution, so $x^2-16>0$, which is the same condition as above.\nThus, the domain of the function is $x\\in\\boxed{(-\\infty,-4)\\cup(4,\\infty)}$.\nWhen $x<-4$, we have $\\sqrt{x^2-16}>0$, so the outer square root is defined.\nWhen $x>4$, we have $\\sqrt{x^2-16}>0$, so the outer square root is defined.\nThese two regions are disjoint, so the entire domain is the union of these regions.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is (-\\infty,-4)\\cup(4,\\infty).

There may be multiple questions or instructions to the task.\n### Original Solution:\nFor the function $f(x) = \\sqrt{\\sqrt{x^2 - 16} - 3}$ to be real-valued, the quantity under the square root must be non-negative. Therefore, $\\sqrt{x^2 - 16} \\ge 3$, which implies $x^2 \\ge 25.$\nSince we cannot have negative square roots, we must also have $\\sqrt{x^2 - 16",
        " Let $y=\\sqrt{\\sqrt{x^2-16}-3}$.\nRecall that the square root of a positive number is positive, and hence $x^2-16>0$. That means $x>4$ or $x<-4$.\nNow, we look at the innermost square root expression $\\sqrt{x^2-16}$.\nIt must be non-negative, so $x^2-16\\ge 0$. Hence, $x^2 \\ge 16 \\Rightarrow \\boxed{|x| \\ge 4}$.\n### Hint: Another way is that since $x^2\\ge 16$, $x$ is either $>4$ or $<-4$.\nNote that $x^2-16=(x+4)(x-4)$. So, either $x+4 \\ge 0$ and $x-4>0$, or $x+4 <0$ and $x-4 \\le 0$. The first case gives $x>4$, and the second case gives $x<-4$. So, $x>4$ or $x<-4$.\nTherefore, we take the intersection of $x>4$ with $x<-4$ for consistency.\n### Conclusion:\n$y=\\sqrt{\\sqrt{x^2-16}-3}$ must satisfy $\\sqrt{x^2-16}\\ge 0$, which means $x^2 \\ge 16 \\Rightarrow |x| \\ge 4$.\nSo, the domain of the function is: $\\boxed{(-\\infty,-4] \\cup [4, \\infty)}$. I believe the question asked for all the values in which $\\sqrt{x^2 - 16} - 3\\ge 0$.  Please let me know if I am right.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is (-\\infty,-4] \\cup [4, \\infty).

So, we know that the domain of the inner square root is $\\boxed{[-\\infty,-4]\\cup[4,\\infty]}$.\nNext, we consider the expression inside the outer square root.

The first inequality holds for all real values of $x$, so we need only consider the second inequality. This is equivalent to $x^2-16\\geq 3^2$, so $x^2-16-9\\geq 0,$ $x^2-25\\geq 0$, which simplifies to $(x-5)(x+5)\\geq 0.$ There are two possibilities:\n\u2022 $x+5\\geq 0$ and $x-5\\geq 0$, which can be simplified to $x\\geq-5$ and $x\\geq 5$.
