I hope it is correct. \nLet us check if what we have derived is correct.\nRemember that we should check all our answers by plugging in some values and checking if it holds true. For the time being, we will manually plug in some values.\nLet $x = 2$. Now, $$49x^2+14x(19-7x)+(19-7x)^2=49(2)^2+14(2)(19-7(2))+(19-7(2))^2=\\boxed{361},$$ which is the correct answer.\nFor this problem, we started off with a third-degree polynomial and reduced it to a third-degree polynomial with zero, namely to a sum of squares.\nRemember that a sum of squares, of the form $(a-b)^2 = a^2-2ab+b^2$, is non-negative for all real $a$ and $b$. So, it will not take on any negative values, which is to be expected for any polynomial function of degree $3$, where we expect that there might be the possibility of having zeros/minimums and/or maximums. It is my opinion that all problem solvers should always plug in some values to check if what we are finding is something that looks good, and if it checks out at a local level. In fact, for the Intermediate Value Theorem, we are guaranteed that it will work for that other value, and we only find that one value in order to prove that it is guaranteed to work. Eventually, I will find the most extremal values of these algebraic functions.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 289x^2-196x+361. I hope it is correct.\n### Note:\nThis algebraic function looks a lot like a parabola, as all of the terms of it have degree $0$, degree $1$ and/or degree $2$.

        " $49x^2+14x(19-7x)+(19-7x)^2$\nThe $14x(19-7x)$ term can be written as $14x(19)-14x(7x)$ to factor out $14x$.\nThen, $14x(19)-14x(7x)$ simplifies to $14x(19)-98x^2$.\nSo now the expression is $49x^2+14x(19)-98x^2+(19-7x)^2$.\nNow, we can combine the two like terms, resulting in $-49x^2+14x(19)+(19-7x)^2$.\nYou can think of it this way. I have a red hat, and I can either give it to my friend with a black hat or my friend with a white hat. My friend with a black hat gives me really big bucks (49), my friend with a white hat gives me moderate buck, but my friend with a black hat draws the biggest prize. $49x^2$ is the biggest prize.\n$14x(19)$ isn\u2019t very much, just a few more bucks.\nI have two options, let\u2019s call the amount I get on this roll $x$. If it\u2019s a black hat, I get $49x^2$, the prize. If it\u2019s not, I get $-49x^2$, and my friend with the hat I tell takes some of my prize.\nWe know my friend with the hat is mostly nice when I\u2019m rolling my halves way. Let\u2019s say it\u2019s heads and tails I\u2019m allowed to roll, and you choose heads. The squares you roll 1 and 2, there isn\u2019t much there right? However, when you roll 3, 4, and even, there a chance there are white hats on both rolls. So then we always get 5 when we go for black hat way, (our way), and extra when we go for black hat way. So I think there you have it.\nAnd then the (19-7x)^2, and the last favorable guess of how you cord and then consider tails comes. So you now consider all instances where.\n### Conclusion: $49x^2+14x(19-7x)+(19-7x)^2=(-7x+19)^2$, or you can express it as $(7x-19)^2$.\nIn fact, check out this",
