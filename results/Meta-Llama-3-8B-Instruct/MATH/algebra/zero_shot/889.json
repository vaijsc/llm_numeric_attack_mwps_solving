        " Context\nWe are solving this problem as a simple algebra problem. To convert this boundary equation into standard form of a circle $(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$, we need to complete the square.\nFirst, we should put all the terms with $x$ on the left side of the equation and all the terms with $y$ on the right side of the equation:\n$$x^2 - 6x + y^2 - 2 y - 6 = 0$$\nNow, if you are familiar with completing the square, you should be able to see that $x^2 - 6x + y^2 - 2 y - 6$ can be written as\n$$(x^2 - 6x + 9 - 9) + (y^2 - 2y + 1 - 1) - 6 = 0$$\nNow we can rewrite this equation as\n$$(x-3)^2 + (y - 1)^2 = 14$$\nwhich is the equation of a circle in standard form with a radius of $\\sqrt{14}$. Therefore, the radius of the cookie is $\\boxed{\\sqrt{14}}$.\nCopyright 2020, Cengage Learning, Inc.\n### Final Answer: The final answer is \\sqrt{14} . I hope it is correct.

        " Let\u2019s first solve for y:\n\\begin{align*}\nx^2+y^2-6&=6x+2y\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad y^2+x^2-6-6x-2y&=0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad (x^2-6x)+(y^2-2y)&=6\n\\end{align*}It seems we have $x-3$ and $y-1$ for two split circles (or two semi-circles). And it says we must solve for $y$, and it asked for a radius.\nLet\u2019s try to rewrite with the formula $(x-h)^2+(y-k)^2=r^2$. We will have two circles (or two semi-circles), so we will have two formulas.\n\\begin{align*}\n(x-3)^2+(y-0)^2&=r^2\\\\\n(x-0)^2+(y-1)^2&=r^2\n\\end{align*}For the first equation, $h=3$, $k=0$, and r=??. For the second equation, $h=0$, $k=1$ and r=??. It looks like we are asked to combine two circles or two semi-circles in a standard way. Indeed we are. We solve for $r$ for both of them and we can get the radius.\n### Solution: For $(x-3)^2+(y-0)^2=r^2$: We see $h=3$, $k=0$. \\begin{align*}\n(x-3)^2+(y-0)^2 &= r^2 \\\\\n(x^2-6x+9)+(y^2)&= r^2\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad r^2&=x^2-6x+9+y^2\n\\end{align*}For $(x-0)^2+(y-1)^2=r^2$: We see $h=0$, $k=1$. \\begin{align*}\n(x-0)^2+(y-1)^2 &= r^2 \\\\\nx^2+(y^2-2y+1)&= r^2\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad r^2&=x^2+y^2-2y+1\n\\end{align*}\n### Answer: Now solving both equations together and see what $\\boxed{r^2 = (x",

        " The first step we take is to complete the squares in the equation, which gives $(x-3)^2+(y-1)^2 = 10$. Then, we notice that the left hand side is in the form of a circle, which we will discuss again later on the webbook. This means the cookie is a circle.\nThe radius of the circle is the square root of the right-hand side. So, we solve the problem. Plugging in the simplest variable $x$ with value zero gives us, $y^2 - 6 = 2y$, $y^2-2y - 6 = 0$. Factoring the quadratic formula, the result is $y = 1 \\pm \\sqrt{5}$.\nSimilarly, solving $x$ with value one gives us, $y^2-2y-5 = 0$, $y = 1 \\pm \\sqrt{6}$. These two equations do not produce a single point solution, which means the equation has no solution for its intersection. Therefore, the circle cannot have any intersection with the line, which is a vertical line. It is a fact that circles and lines cannot have any intersection eventually, as curve equations have this, which makes the concept clear to any one studying in line equations and, thus, the book confirms this in this show.\nThe next step is to compare how circles are developed or created in an equation\nTo learn about circles in slope-intercept form, visit mathopenref.com lingermeeformulaletterslope.html\nTo learn about circle in general, go to mathopenref.com / circles.html a circle are.

        " (Refer: Long radius approach)\nThe given equation is $x^2+y^2 - 6 = 6x + 2 y$ or $(x - 3)^2 + (y - 1)^2 = 10$.\nWe can rearrange this to $(x-3)^2 + (y-1)^2 = 5^2$ which is the equation of a circle with radius 5. Therefore the Cookie Monster should decide that this cookie is a **snack-sized cookie**.",
        " We need to get an equation into the standard form of a circle.\nFor the equation $x^2+y^2 - 6 = 6x + 2 y$ to be the equation of a circle, we must first move the $x^2+y^2$ to the left-hand side and the terms with $x$ and $y$ to the right-hand side. We will use the following steps:\n1. Add $6$ to both sides: $$x^2 + y^2 = 6x + 2 y + 6$$ \n2. Transform using completing the square: $$x^2 -6x + y^2 -2 y = 6$$ \n3. Add $9+1$ to both sides: $$x^2 - 6x + 9 + y^2 -2 y + 1 = 6 + 9 + 1$$ \nTransform the first parentheses using $a^2-2ab+b^2$:\n$$(x-3)^2 + (y-1)^2 = 16$$ \n### Conclusion: Therefore, the radius of the cookie is $\\boxed{4}$.
