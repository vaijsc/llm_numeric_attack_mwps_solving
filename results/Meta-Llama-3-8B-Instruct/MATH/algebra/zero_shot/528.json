    "solution": "There are two ways to do this quickly: Set $\\frac{n^2-n}{2} = 55$, multiply both sides by 2, so that you have $n^2 - n = 110$.  Then, quickly notice that $n = 11$ is the only number conceivably close enough such that that equation will work (namely, $n = 10$ is too small, and $n = 12$ is too big, since 144 is way greater than 110.)  If you do the problem in this manner, you should do it all in your head so as to be able to do it more quickly (and you gain nothing from writing it out).\n\nThe other way is to quickly factor the numerator to $n(n-1)$, and once again multiply both sides by 2.  Then, you'll have $n(n-1) = 110$, from which you should recognize that both 10 and 11 are factors, from which you get $n = \\boxed{11}$.\n\nWe can also solve this as a quadratic equation. $n(n-1) = 110$ becomes $n^2 - n - 110 = 0$. Factoring, we find that $(n - 11)(n + 10) = 0.$ This gives us $n = 11$ or $n = -10,$ but $n$ must be positive, so $n = \\boxed{11}$.",

        " Solution\nRecall the formula: For $n$ teams, the number of games played is $(n^2-n)/2$. How many teams $n$ are in a tournament with $55$ games played? We want to solve the equation $(n^2-n)/2=55$ for $n$.\n\u2022 Since $55$ is positive, $(n^2-n)/2$ must also be positive. Simplify the left side of the equation by using the distributive law to multiply $n^2-n$ with $\\frac{1}{2}$: $n^2-n=2\\cdot55=110$. We then multiply both sides with $2$ and further simplify to get $n^2-n=110$.\n\u2022 This is a quadratic equation. If you know the quadratic formulas or roots, you can see that $n^2-n-110=(n-14)(n+8)=0$. Therefore, we get the two possible values for $n$.\n#### n\n\u2022 \u20ac$n_1=14$\n\u2022 \u20ac$n_2=-8$.\nHere, it doesn't make much sense to have a negative number of teams in a round-robin tournament.

        " Let\u2019s set up a simple table.\n|| $n$ | $n^2$ | $n^2-n$ | $\\frac{n^2-n}{2}$ | $55$ | |\nSince we are looking for the number of teams, $n$, we need to set up an equation. Let\u2019s set up an equation using the last column. \\begin{align*}\n&\\frac{n^2-n}{2}=55\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad & n^2-n = 110\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad & n^2-n-110=0\n\\end{align*}We can factor this equation by grouping. We need to split the first term $n^2$ into two binomials, and then add and subtract 110 to complete the factoring. \\begin{align*}\nn^2-n-110 &= 0\\\\\n(n^2-11n+10n)-110&=0\\\\\n(n(n-11)+10(n-11))-110&=0\\\\\n(n-1)(n-11)&=0\n\\end{align*}So, we have two solutions. When we set both possible values equal to zero, we get \\begin{align*}\nn-1&=0\\Rightarrow n=1\\\\\nn-11&=0\\Rightarrow n=11\n\\end{align*}We cannot have negative values for the number of teams. We also can\u2019t have only one team, as that wouldn\u2019t make sense in a round-robin tournament. Therefore, we can eliminate both solutions and start again by listing out possible solutions. Let\u2019s go back to the original equation and use guess and check. \\begin{align*}\n&\\frac{n^2-n}{2}=55\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad & n^2-n=110\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad & n^2-n-110=0\n\\end{align*}We can use $8$, which is a perfect square, to test for a solution. \\begin{align*}\n&8^2-8-110=0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad &64-8-110=0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad &64-118=0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad &64-64=0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad &0=0\\qquad\\text{Yes!}\n\\end{align*}This tells us that $",
        " Let\u2019s let $n$ be the number of teams in a round-robin tournament where 55 games are played. Number of games that must be played = $n^2 - n/2$. It must be equal to 55. So $n^2 - n/2 = 55$. We now need to isolate $n$. So $n^2 - n = 110$. Add $n$ in both sides. We get $n^2 = 110 + n$. Bring $n$ to the left. Now we get $n^2 - n - 110 = 0$. We want to factor this equation. Now, we are little bit tricky here. Think that $n$ is equal to $(n - 10 + 11)$ and $(n - 10 - 11)$. Now, take $(n - 10 + 11)$ with $(n - 10 - 11)$. We get $(n - 10)^2 - 121 = 0$. This equation is not easy to factor. So here is trick, we will change $-121$ to $121$ by multiplying by $(-1)$. Now we get $(n - 10)^2 - 121$. Factoring as $(n - 10)^2 - (11)^2 = (n - 10 + 11)(n - 10 - 11) = (n - 10)^2 - 11^2$. Compare both sides and we get $n^2 - 10n + 100 - 121 = 0$. Now subtract $100$ to both sides and we get $n^2 - 10n - 21 = 0$. Check if $n$ is $11$. We get $11^2 - 10*11 - 21 = 121 - 110 - 21 = 1 - 21 = -20$. This answer is wrong. We will make another guess. Check if $n$ is $9$. We get $9^2 - 10*9 - 21 = 81 - 90 - 21 = -30$. We will make another guess. Check if $n$ is $12$. We get $12^2 - 10*12 - 21 = 144 - 120 - 21 = 3 - 21 = -18$. We will make another guess. Check if $n$ is $8$. We get $8^2 - 10",

        " For this problem we must come to a common notion as to what the number of games that must be played is. Let us identify it as a variable then.  It is equal to $(n^2-n)/2$. Now we have a variable which we must solve. The given information is: the number of games that must be played is 55. By this we understand that the number of games must equal 55. Now we can substitute the value of n^2-n over 2 with 55. We can rearrange the equation as follows: (n^2-n)/2 = 55 First we must multiply both sides by 2. We get n^2 \u2013 n = 110. The next step is to factor the quadratic expression. It becomes (n-11)(n+1) = 0. The roots are n-11 = 0 or n+1 = 0. Adding 11 to both sides, we get n = 11. Subtracting 1 from both sides, we get n = 10. Since we know that a team cannot have a negative number of members, the number of members cannot be 10. Therefore, n = 11 is our final answer.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 11. I hope it is correct.
