        " $$a(x+d)^2+e=-2x^2-20x-53$$ When the expansion of $a(x+d)^2+e$ is $-2x^2-20x-53$, then we can think of it like this.\nFirst of all, $a(x+d)^2+e$ is a quadratic expression in $x$ so $a(x+d)^2+e=-2x^2-20x-53$ should also be in the form of $-2x^2+ax+b$.\nHence, we can compare every term to see what the expansion of $a(x+d)^2+e$ is. \\begin{align*}\na(x+d)^2+e&=-2x^2-20x-53\\\\\na(x+d)^2&=-2x^2+ax,\\tag{1}\\label{1}\n-e&=-20x-53\\tag{2}\\label{2}\n\\end{align*}\nFrom equation $\\ref{1},$ we can see that the quadratic expression is in the form $-2x^2+ax$ so we must have $ax=-2(x+d)^2$ by comparing with equation $\\ref{1}$.\nTo expand $(x+d)^2$, we can complete the squares. We have the following:\n$$(x+d)^2=x^2+2xd+d^2.$$\nHence, we can write $$a(-2(x+d)^2)=-2x^2-4xd-2d^2.$$\nSince we know $ax=-2x^2$, we have $$ax=-2x^2=2x^2-2x\\cdot (d)+2d^2$$\nThen $d=-0.5$. Taking it back to equation $\\ref{1}$, we know that $a$ should be 2. Hence, we can write the final expression as $$2(x-0.5)^2-2.5=2x^2-2x-0.5=-2x^2-20x-53.$$\nFrom equation $\\ref{2}$, we know that $-e=-20x-53$ and hence $e=20x+53$.

For your case, the answer is $-452$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -452. I hope it is correct. Thank you for reading my response. // Relevant paragraph: In a polynomial expression written as $a(x+d)^2+e$, consider that setting $x=-\\frac{d}{2}$ makes the expression simplify as $a\\left(-\\frac{d}{2}+d\\right)^2+e = a(2d)^2+e = a\\cdot d^2+e$. This could be confirmed using the quadratic formula. Therefore, if $a(x+d)^2+e = -2x^2-20x-53$, then setting $x = -\\frac{d}{2}$ should make the left side of the equation equal to $a\\cdot d^2+e = -53$, and so, $d^2 = 25$ since $a = 1$. The most effective strategy would be to consider the expression equals $a(x+d)^2+e = -2x^2-20x-53$ and then apply the quadratic formula to find $x$. If I find $x$ and multiply both sides by $a$, I can find $a, d$, and $e$. First, I must pick the point $(x, y)$ that has the same slope with the function Transform the formula to this, y = -2x^2 - 20x - 53: 2x^2 + 20x + 53. Now you can find the x-coordinates of these points on the two curves. Having these x-coordinates, you can substitute them into requirement equation and factor the results",

        "  a(x+d)^2+e:\nWe will do this, together with NRICH.\nWe have an expression $-2x^2-20x-53$ which we would like to express in the polynomial form $a(x+d)^2+e$.\n### Step 1: Write in the standard form of $(x+d)^2$.\nIn order to write the expression $-2x^2-20x-53$ in the form $a(x+d)^2+e$, first we need to expand the form $(x+d)^2$. Therefore, we will express $(x+d)^2$ as $(x+d)(x+d)=x^2+2xd+d^2$.\nNow we substitute $x^2$ for $x^2$, $2xd$ for $-20x$, and $d^2$ for $-53$. Therefore, we have $-2x^2-20x-53=x^2+2xd+d^2$.\n### Step 2: Solve for $x^2$, $2xd$, and $d^2$.\nLet\u2019s put the values $-2x^2=-x^2$, $-20x=2xd$, and $-53=d^2$.\nFrom $-2x^2=-x^2$, we can see that $x^2=-x^2$, which gives $x^2=0$. Hence, we can see that $x=0$.\nFrom $-20x=2xd$, we can see that $-20=2d$, so $d=-10$.\n### Step 3: Calculate $a$, $d$, and $e$.\nFrom $x^2=0$, we get $a=-2$, $d=-10$, and $e=-53-2(-10)^2=-53-2*100=-153$.\n### Step 4: Calculate $a+d+e$.\nGiven $a=(-2)$, $d=(-10)$, and $e=(-153)$, we can easily calculate $a+d+e$.\nHence, $a+d+e=(-2)+(-10)+(-153)=-165$.\nThus, $a+d+e=\\boxed{-165}.$ \nPlease give me your hashtags.

        " 1\nFirst, we shall start by completing the square of the expression, to transform it in the desired form:\n\\begin{align*}\n-2x^2-20x-53&=-2(x^2+10x+\\,\\,\\,...)+\\ldots-53\\\\\n&=-2(x^2+10x+25)+25-53\\\\\n&=-2(x+5)^2-\\boxed{28}.\n\\end{align*}\nTherefore, we can identify:\n\\begin{align*}\na&=-2\\\\\nd&=5\\\\\ne&=-28.\n\\end{align*}\nThe sum $a+d+e$ is thus equal to: $a+d+e = -2+5-28=-25$. This is the final answer.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -25. I hope it is correct.  ];\n### "
