        " $1225$\nYour calculation is almost correct. $115^2 = 13225$. You may have made a small mistake. Practice is the key to becoming proficient in mental calculations. Practice will help you reduce errors and improve your speed and accuracy.\n",
        " First, recognize that $115 = 100 + 15$, so $115^2 = (100 + 15)^2 = 100^2 + 2 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 15 + 15^2$.  Recall that $100^2 = 10000$ and $15^2 = 225$.\n### Solution: second step, calculate $2 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 15 = 2 \\cdot 1500 = 3000$ so $115^2 = 10000 + 3000 + 225$. This amount to $13225.$\n#### But i didn't know that $2 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 15 = 3000$, do i need to memorize product of 2-digit numbers x 2-digit numbers?\nNo, I did not memorize those products. Instead, I used quick mental calculations. Here are some mental tricks to help you calculate with 2-digit numbers in your head:\n**Mental Trick 1:** When calculating the product of 2-digit numbers, you can break them down into hundreds and tens.\n**Example:** Calculate $14 \\cdot 25$. Quick calculation: $14$ is equivalent to $10 + 4$; $25$ is equivalent to $20 + 5$. So,\n$$14 \\cdot 25 = (10 + 4)(20 + 5) = 10 \\cdot 20 + 4 \\cdot 20 + 10 \\cdot 5 + 4 \\cdot 5 = 200 + 80 + 50 + 20 = 350.$$**Mental Trick 2:** Another trick is to use place value to calculate products. For example, when calculating $23 \\cdot 17$, I think:\n$$23 = 20 + 3, \\quad 17 = 20 - 3.$$This gives me a lot of cancellation:\n$$23 \\cdot 17 = (20 + 3)(20 - 3) = 400 - 9 = 391.$$This reduces my mental calculation!\n**Mental Trick 3:** When multiplying 2-digit numbers ending in 5 or 0, you can multiply them by 10 and then adjust.\n**Example:** Calculate $36 \\cdot 25$. I multiply $36$ by $20$ to get 720, then add $3 \\cdot 5 = 15$ to obtain $720 + 15 = 735$.\nTry these mental tricks,",
        " 15,225\nGreat job! You have computed the result of $115^2$ in your head.\nNote that $115=100+15.$ So, we can write $115^2$ as $(100+15)^2$ and use the binomial theorem to expand this product:\n$(100+15)^2=100^2+2(100)(15)+15^2=10,000+3000+225=15,225$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 15,225. I hope it is correct.",
        " ((115)(115))\nWe have 115 to the power of 2. This is 115 * 115. And what is 115 * 100? Well, 100 is just 1 hundred, so it\u2019s basically 100 hundred-and-fifteens subtracted by 11 hundred-and-fifteens. That\u2019s 11,500. Now we have 11,500 and we have 150 left over to add. 115 times 15 is 1725. So we add 11,500 and 1,725 and we get 13,225.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 13225. I hope it is correct..AllowUser\n## Practice problem 1 Real life application\nYou are on a diet and you want to know how many calories you are consuming every day. One of your meals is a large pizza that weighs 3.14 pounds with a crust of 0.5 pounds and 12 slices. If every slice is equal in size and you eat 7 slices, how many calories do you consume from this meal? If the crust is 150 calories per pound and each slice is 50 calories, how many calories do you consume?### Solution:\nLet\u2019s start with the pizza itself. There are 12 slices and 7 slices you eat. So you eat \u00bd of the pizza. Pizza is 3.14 pounds and the crust is 0.5 pounds. So the pizza with just the toppings is 3.14 - 0.5 = 2.64 pounds. The toppings (pizza) is then 2.64 pounds and that\u2019s equal to 2.64 * 50 = 132 calories. The crust is 0.5 pounds and that\u2019s 0.5 * 150 = 75 calories. You eat 1/2 the crust, so that\u2019s 75 / 2 = 37.5. The total calorie you consume is then 132 + 75 = 207 calories. So you consume 207 calories from this meal.",

Finally we add our integer part, then add the result $225$ to $125$ to get $125+225=\\boxed{15,225}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 15,225.

To calculate $234^2=(200+30+4)^2$, I would do the following: First, I would calculate $(200+30)^2=20000+1200+300=23600$. Next, I would multiply this result by $4^2=16$ to get $23600\\cdot16=376000$.

        " $13225$\nProof: Notice that $115=100+15$. We can use the fact that $(a+b)^2=a^2+2ab+b^2$.

I hope it is correct. Solution: An efficient way to do this problem mentally is to remember that the square of a number is roughly the same as the number 20 times itself. So, since 115 is a bit more than 100, we could just estimate it as 2500. But since 115 is only slightly bigger than 100, we should really get it a bit closer. So 115 times 115 is getting to be pretty close to 13000. Let's see, since we're only missing 225, we could make it work. We've been talking like 13000, but we should multiply it by 3025 first to make sure that after we add the next piece that 225 will be enough. This way 115 times 115 is 12,725 and that sounds more correct to me. Final Answer: The final answer is 13225. I hope it is correct.

        " 13225\nThe calculation is:\n$$115^2=(110+5)^2=110^2+2\\cdot 110\\cdot 5+5^2=12100+1100+25=13225$$\n### Summary: The purpose of this problem is to check if you can perform multiplication quickly in your head. You are expected to be able to multiply two one-digit numbers and multiply by an digit before doing the last multiplication. In this case, it is multiplying 115 with itself. This is a natural place to stop if we don't know the perfect square $(110+5)^2$, and we should be able to find the perfect square because it's a common multiplication in everyday life.\nNote: I didn't directly use the perfect square as an intermediate step, in case it's not natural for you. However, remember, it's often easier and faster to stop at the intermediate step and then use your muscle memory to finish the calculation. The actual calculation in this problem is $(110^2+2\\cdot110\\cdot 5+5^2)$, which allows you to slow down and focus on each term. Don't worry if it doesn't look easy to find it immediately. Given time and practice, your math fluency will get better. Some other mathematical operations in your head will also be similar.\nSource: David E. Joyce, Clark University.

Now we add the two results: 10000 + 225 = 12225.\n Thus, $115^2 = 12225.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 12225. I hope it is correct.  An equation for area of rectangle. \n1. ...
