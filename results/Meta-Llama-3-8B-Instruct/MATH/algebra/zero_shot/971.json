        " First, we need to find the value of $f(4)$.\n$f(4) = 4^2 - 4\\sqrt{4} + 1 = 16 - 8 + 1 = 9$.\n### ",
        " $f(4) = 4^2 - 4\\sqrt4 + 1 = 16 - 4 + 1 = 13$; therefore, $f(f(4)) = f(13) = 13^2 - 4\\sqrt{13} + 1 = \\boxed{168}.$\n### Explanation:\nIn this problem, we have replaced $x$ with 4 in $f(x)$ and denote the answer as $f(4)$. Now, we replace $x$ with $f(4)$ in $f(x)$, which is denoted as $f(f(4))$. In the first step, we have calculated $f(4)$ using the given formula. In the second step, we used the calculated value of $f(4)$ as $x$ in $f(x)$ to calculate $f(f(4))$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 168. I hope it is correct. ### Practice Problem: What is $f(f(1))$? Now we need to calculate the given function in two steps.\n### ",
        " We would like to evaluate $f(f(4))$. This means we need to evaluate $f(4)$ first, and then use the result as the input for the function $f$. So let's start with $f(4)$. We have\n\\begin{align*}\nf(4)&=16-4\\sqrt{4}+1\\\\\n&=16-8+1\\\\\n&=9.\n\\end{align*}So $f(4)=9$. Next, we would like to evaluate $f(9)$. We have\n\\begin{align*}\nf(9)&=9^2-4\\sqrt{9}+1\\\\\n&=81-12+1\\\\\n&=70.\n\\end{align*}So $f(9)=70$. Finally, we have $f(f(4)) = \\boxed{70}.$\n### Note: The problem is asking for $f(f(4))$, that is, we need to evaluate $f$ by using the output of $f$ (which is $f(4)=9$) as the input of the function $f$ again. Therefore, we have $f(f(4))=f(9)=70$. Final Answer: The final answer is 70. I hope it is correct.  [please take my feedback] I have taken your feedback.
