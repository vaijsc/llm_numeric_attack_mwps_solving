To find the smallest integer value of c, we can conclude that the smallest integer value of c is $\\boxed{c = 7}.$\n### Is this correct?\nYes, the solution is correct. The function f(x) = frac{2x^2 + x + 5}{x^2 + 4x + c} has a domain of all real numbers when c >= 7. The smallest integer value of c is c = 7. Therefore, the correct answer is c = 7.",
        " To solve this problem, we must consider the denominator of $f(x)$, which is $x^2+4x+c$. If the denominator is zero for any real value of $x$, then that value is not part of the domain. So, we must solve the equation $x^2+4x+c=0$. We can use the quadratic formula to do so, remembering that c is a constant, while a and b are variables. The quadratic formula is $x=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$. So we have\n\\begin{align} x &= \\frac{-4\\pm\\sqrt{4^2-4c}}{2}\\\\ &= \\frac{-4\\pm\\sqrt{16-4c}}{2}\\\\ &= \\frac{-2\\pm\\sqrt{8-c}}{1} \\end{align}\nFor this to have a real solution, the quantity inside the radical must be non-negative. Therefore, we must have $8-c\\ge 0$, which implies $c\\le 8$. Now, let\u2019s think about what happens if $c<0$. If $c<0$, then for any positive real number $r$, we have $\\sqrt{8-c}>r$. Using this to choose a value of $x$ in our quadratic formula, we can see that the solutions to the equation $x^2+4x+c=0$ always have a positive real part.\n### Sheet The answers given in the sheet are the domain of all real numbers. #### Integer value of $c$ such that the function $f(x)$ has a domain of all real numbers.\nWe can use the quadratic formula to solve the equation $x^2+4x+c=0$. This equation is zero for any real value of $x$ when its discriminant b^2-4ac is less than or equal to 0. In other words, its solution set is the empty set \\emptyset when $b^2-4ac=4^2-4c\\le 0$, or equivalently, $c\\ge 4$. So, the answer to the question is \\boxed{4}. Therefore, the smallest integer value of c such that the function f(x) has a domain of all real numbers is 4. The given function is\n\\begin{align*}\nf(x) &= \\frac{2x^2+x+5}{x^",
        " A possible solution can be as follows. To ensure that $x^2+4x+c$ is never equal to zero, it cannot have real roots. This means the discriminant $16-4c$ must be less than $0$.  Solving for $c$ yields $c > 4$.  Hence, the minimum possible integer value is $c=\\boxed{5}$.\nExplanation:\nTo ensure that the function $f(x)=\\frac{2x^2+x+5}{x^2+4x+c}$ has a domain of all real numbers, we require the denominator $x^2+4x+c$ to be non-zero for all real $x$.  That is, the denominator has no real roots.  If it does, the function will have a vertical asymptote at that point and will not have a domain of all real numbers.\nThe roots of the quadratic $x^2+4x+c$ are given by the quadratic formula: $$x=\\frac{-4\\pm\\sqrt{16-4c}}{2}.$$\nThe quadratic has real roots if and only if $16-4c \\ge 0$, which implies that $c \\le 4$.  We can conclude that the function $f(x)$ has real roots if and only if $c \\le 4$.\nOn the other hand, if $c > 4$, the denominator $x^2+4x+c$ has no real roots and thus the function $f(x)$ has a domain of all real numbers.\nSince we require the minimum possible integer value of $c$ such that the function $f(x)$ has a domain of all real numbers, we choose the smallest integer greater than 4, which is $\\boxed{c=5}$.  Therefore, the smallest integer value of $c$ is 5.  This completes the solution.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is c=5. I hope it is correct.  #### QUESTION: Given that 2xy + 3x + 5y + 4 = 0, what are the values of x and y? When we solve systems of equations, we can either use substitution, elimination or matrices depending on the format of the system and personal preference. Here is a solution using the elimination method. A possible solution can be as follows. We write the system as: 2xy+3x+5y+4=0 2xy+3x+5y+",
        " To find the smallest integer value of $c$, we need to ensure that $x^2+4x+c$ does not have any real roots. This implies its discriminant must be less than zero. That is, \\begin{align*} 4^2-4\\cdot1\\cdot c&<0\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad 16-4c&<0\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad 4c&<16\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad c&<\\frac{16}{4}=4 \\end{align*}The smallest integer satisfying this condition is $c=3$. That is, when $c=3$, the domain of $f(x)$ consists of all real numbers. So, we can take $\\boxed{c=\\displaystyle 3}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is c=3.

        " \nSuppose we consider a function $f(x)=\\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}$ where $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ are polynomials. Then, if $f(x)$ has domain of all real numbers, then $Q(x)$ should have no real roots. If $Q(x)$ has a real root, then this root can be eliminated from the domain of $f$, hence $f(x)$ will no longer have domain all of real numbers.\nIn our present case, we have that $Q(x)=x^2+4x+c$.\nTo find the roots of $Q(x)=0$, we solve $x^2+4x+c=0$ using the quadratic formula:\n\\begin{equation*}x=\\frac{-4\\pm\\sqrt{16-4c}}{2}=\\frac{-4\\pm2\\sqrt{4-c}}{2}=-2\\pm\\sqrt{4-c}\n\\end{equation*}\nHence, the roots of $Q(x)$ are $-2-\\sqrt{4-c}$ and $-2+\\sqrt{4-c}$.\nWe want $Q(x)$ to have no real roots, which implies that $4-c\\le0\\Rightarrow c\\ge4$. Therefore, $c$ should be at least $4$.\nWe now use the given condition that $x^2+4x+c=(x-(-2-\\sqrt{4-c})(x-(-2+\\sqrt{4-c}))\\Rightarrow(x+(2-\\sqrt{4-c}))(x+(2+\\sqrt{4-c}))=x^2+4x+c\\Rightarrow1=x+(2+\\sqrt{4-c})$ or $1=x+(2-\\sqrt{4-c})$ or $1=x+(2+\\sqrt{4-c})$ for all values of $x$ but $-2+\\sqrt{4-c}$ or $-2-\\sqrt{4-c}$. This implies that $1=-(2-\\sqrt{4-c})$ or $1=-(2+\\sqrt{4-c})$ or $1=-(2+\\sqrt{4-c})$, so we get two equations $2-\\sqrt{4-c}=1$ and $2+\\sqrt{4-c}=1$. Solving for $\\sqrt{4-c}$ in both the equations gives us $\\sqrt{4-c}=1$ and $\\sqrt{4-c}=1$. Thus,",
        " A first step is to consider the denominator of the ratio of functions, $(x^2+4x+c)$. For $x^2+4x+c$ to be defined for all real $x$, we need it to be nonzero for all real $x$. For this to happen, we must have $c \\geq 4^2 = 16$ or else we would have a zero when $x=-2$. Let\u2019s assume $c > 16$ for now; the quadratic can be written as $(x+2)^2 + c -16$ and since $c-16 > 0$, this is a nonnegative expression that is equal to $0$ when $x=-2$. Hence, for all real $x$, we have either the denominator is positive, or the denominator is zero at $x=-2$.\nThus, either the function has $x=-2$ as a hole or not. In the former case, we must assume that $c > 16$ or the function collapses down to $\\frac{2x^2+x+5}{(x+2)^2}$. This denominator is never zero, and not greater than zero, so by the factor theorem, the only zero is a double zero at $x=0$ and besides, $x^2\\ge$ $0$ for all real $x$.\nIf we manage to get $c = 16$, we have the function @ $x^2+4x+16$, or $(x+2)^2$, so we get to test something. Since all real numbers are greater than or equal to $0$ and strictly greater than $0$ whenever not equal to $0$, we have it. In that case, we have $c=16$ for the minimum integer value of $c$, which is the smallest integer that replicates the stated response.\n### Conclusion: Using the provided instructions, we have found that the smallest integer value of $c$ satisfying the requirement is $c=\\boxed{16}$.\n---\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 16.

By the Corollary to the Remainder Theorem, the quadratic function x^2 + 4x + c, or x^2 + 4x + c + 0 has a zero if c=0, c=4, and c=-1.  That means that if c is any integer value, which is less than c=4, or less than c=-1, then the domain of f(x) is all real numbers.
