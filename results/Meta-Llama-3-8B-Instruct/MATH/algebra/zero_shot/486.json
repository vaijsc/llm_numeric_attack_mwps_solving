        " We are given that $|{-2y}|\\cdot\\left|{-\\dfrac{y}{2}}\\right| = 36$.  First we can consider that $y<0$. Then, we will have $2y > 0$, and $\\frac{y}{2} < 0$. In this case, we have $|2y|\\cdot|-\\frac{y}{2}| = 2y\\cdot\\frac{y}{2} = y^2 = 36$, which is not satisfied as $y$ is negative.\n### Next, we consider that $y > 0$, which means that $2y > 0$ and $\\frac{y}{2} > 0$. In this case, we have $2y\\cdot\\frac{y}{2} = y^2 = 36$, so we find two solutions to be $y = \\pm6$.

        " Firstly, we have $|{-2y}|\\cdot\\left|{-\\dfrac{y}{2}}\\right| = 36$. Which tells us that $|{-2y}\\cdot-(-\\frac{y}{2})|=36$. We know that, $-2y$ and $-\\dfrac{y}{2}$ have the same sign, so $2y$ and $y$ have the same sign as well. That\u2019s because if the signs are different, their product will be negative. So, $2y$ and $y$ will be either both positive or both negative.\nLet\u2019s first look at the case when $2y$ and $y$ are both positive. Then $-2y=-2y$ and $-\\dfrac{y}{2}=-\\dfrac{y}{2}$. They are equal to each other, and we can simplify $\\left|{-2y}\\right|=\\left|{\\dfrac{y}{2}}\\right|$ Now we have $\\left|{-2y}\\right|\\cdot\\left|{-\\dfrac{y}{2}}\\right|=36$, and we can substitute $\\left|{-2y}\\right|=\\left|{\\dfrac{y}{2}}\\right|$ and we get $\\left|{\\dfrac{y}{2}}\\right|\\cdot\\left|{\\dfrac{y}{2}}\\right|=36$.

        " A detailed solution.\nOur goal is to find the product of all real values of $y$ that satisfy the given equation. It seems reasonable to start by simplifying the left-hand side. \\\\\nWe can see that the absolute value bars can be simplfied to result in\n$$|{-2y}|\\cdot\\left|{-\\dfrac{y}{2}}\\right| = |-2y|\\cdot |-y/2| = 2|y|\\cdot |y/2|=|y^2|.$$ \\\\\nSince $|y^2|=y^2$ whenever $y$ is non-negative and $|y^2|=-(y^2)$ whenever $y$ is negative, we know that the LHS only depends on $y^2$, not on its sign. Therefore, we can split it up into two cases:\n$$y\\ge 0\\Rightarrow 2|y|\\cdot |y/2| = y^2=36 \\Rightarrow y=\\pm\\sqrt{36}=\\pm 6,$$\n$$y<0\\Rightarrow 2|y|\\cdot |y/2| = -(y^2)=36 \\Rightarrow y^2=-36\\Rightarrow y = \\pm i 6.$$It seems that there are infinitely many complex values of $y$ that satisfy the given equation. By juxtaposition with the question, we know that we need to find the product of those real values of $y$. Now, taking a look at the case when $y\\ge 0$, we can easily see that $$y=0$$ is not a solution because the LHS is undefined, and $$y=6$$ and $$y=-6$$ are both solutions. Moreover, from the second case when $$y<0$$, we can see that $$y=-6$$ is also a solution but $$y=i6$$ is not because it is complex. Summing up our results, we have $$(-6)\\cdot6=\\boxed{-36}.$$ It seems reasonable to think that if we graph the function $$f(y) = 36 \\Rightarrow y^2 = 36$$ in the complex plane, it would only meet our conditions for real values of $y$ at $(-6, 0)$ and $(6, 0)$. Additionally, if we evaluate the function $$g(y) = -36$$ in the same plane, then it would also only meet the conditions at $(-6, 0)$ and $(",
        " Final Answer: The final answer is 36. I hope it is correct.  First, we know that $\\left|{-2y}\\right|\\cdot\\left|{-\\dfrac{y}{2}}\\right|=36$. We know that the product of two absolute values is always nonnegative, so $\\left|{-2y}\\right|$ and $\\left|{-\\dfrac{y}{2}}\\right|$ must both be positive. We know that $|{-a}|=a$, so we can conclude that $2y>0$ and $\\dfrac{y}{2}>0$. This means $y>0$.$$36=|{-2y}| \\cdot |- \\frac{y}{2} | = 2y \\cdot \\frac{y}{2} = y^2.$$We know that $y^2 = 36$, so $y = \\pm 6$. $$y > 0$$, so we can ignore the solution $y = -6$, because $y = 0$ and $y = 6$ are both solutions to the equation. Finally, we can multiply $y = 6$ to find the product of all real solutions, which is $\\boxed{36}$. Final Answer: The final answer is 36. I hope it is correct.  I don\u2019t want to partially mark.

        " Let\u2019s start by thinking about the given expression. $|{-2y}|\\cdot\\left|{-\\dfrac{y}{2}}\\right| = 36$. Clearly, we don't need to split up this expression like normal, since one value of $y$ gives $36$. Think about the different possible cases of $y$. One: $y \u2265 0$, then $\u22122y \u2265 0$ and $\u2212y/2 \u2265 0$, then $\u22122y\\cdot(y/2) = y^2$ must be 36. Then, $y = \u00b16$. But there are additional cases to consider.\nSecond: $y < 0$. For this case, $\u22122y < 0$ and $\u2212y/2 < 0$. So $\u22122y\\cdot(y/2) = y^2/2$ must be 36. This value is only positive.\nLet\u2019s look at the last part of our Introduction to Proof, Linear Algebra Proof: Any two vectors in $\\mathbf{R}^{n}$ are equal if and only if their corresponding entries are equal. $\\implies$ We will compare corresponding entries. \\begin{align*}\n&y^2/2 = 36\\\\\n\\implies &y^2 = 72\\\\\n\\implies &y = \\pm\\sqrt{72}\\\\\n\\implies &y = \\pm\\sqrt{36\\cdot2}\\\\\n\\implies &y = \\pm6\\sqrt{2}\\\\\n\\implies &y = \u00b16\\sqrt{2}\n\\end{align*} $\\that$ - 36 - 6 $\\implies y = 6\\sqrt{2}$.

        "  $y = 0, \\pm 12$\nWe have that $\\vert{-2y}\\vert\\cdot\\vert{-\\dfrac{y}{2}}\\vert=36.$ We know that $\\vert{-2y}\\vert = |-2y|$.

This simplifies to $2\\vert y\\vert^2=36$. Taking the square root of both sides, $\\vert y\\vert=\\pm 6$. Now that we know that $\\vert y\\vert $ is either $6$ or $-6$, we can test these two values for $y$ because they are real. We know that when we take the absolute value, it always gives a nonnegative number. This means that $y$ can either be $6$, $-6$, or $0$, because $-6$ and $6$ take into account the two possible cases for the absolute value test. Now that we have found the values of $y$, we can find the product of all of them. $0\\times (-6)\\times6=\\boxed{0}$. \nFinal Answer: The final answer is 0. I hope it is correct.  Closed assigned! ",
