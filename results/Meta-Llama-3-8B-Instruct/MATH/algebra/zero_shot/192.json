        " If we replace $A$ by $9$ and $B$ by $0$, the definition of $\\Psi$ gives $9\\ \\Psi\\ B=2\\cdot9+5\\cdot 0=18$. Then $C=9\\ \\Psi\\ 0$. If we replace $A$ by $3$ and $B$ by $1$, the definition of $\\Psi$ gives $3\\ \\Psi\\ 1=2\\cdot3+5\\cdot1=11$. Then $D=3\\ \\Psi\\ 1$. Next, $9\\ \\Psi\\ (3\\ \\Psi\\ 1)$ can be replaced with $9\\ \\Psi\\ D$. Replacing $\\Psi$ and $D$, we have $9\\ \\Psi\\ D=2\\cdot 9+5\\cdot 11=43$.\n### Solution: Hence, the query results in $\\boxed{43}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 43. I hope it is correct.
