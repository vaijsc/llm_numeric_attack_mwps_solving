Here is the full solution.\nThere are a couple of ways we can simplify the expression.  One way to simplify it is by using the fact that $64=16^2=8^4=4^8=2^{12}$ and that $\\sqrt{(x^d)^{q/d}}=x^{(q/d)d/q}=x^{\\frac{q}{d}}$.

Plugging these values back into the expression, we obtain $$\\sqrt{\\sqrt{4096} + \\sqrt[3]{4096} + \\sqrt[4]{4096}}=\\sqrt{64+64+64}=\\sqrt{192}=\\boxed{64}.$$Another way we can simplify the expression is by noticing that $\\sqrt{12}=2\\sqrt{3}$, so $\\sqrt{4096}=\\sqrt{(64)^2}=(64)(\\sqrt{12}/64)=64\\cdot1=64$, $\\sqrt[3]{4096}=\\sqrt[3]{(64)^3}=(64)^{2/3}=(64)\\sqrt[3]{12}=64\\cdot1=64$, and $\\sqrt[4]{4096}=\\sqrt[4]{(64)^4}=(64)^{3/4}=(64)\\sqrt[4]{12}=64\\cdot1=64$.
