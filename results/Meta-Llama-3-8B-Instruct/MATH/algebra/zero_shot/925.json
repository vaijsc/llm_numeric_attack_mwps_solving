        " The sum of the two numbers is 25. Let one of the numbers be X1. Then the other number must be 25 - X1. Now we know that their difference is 11. (Example: 11- (25-X1)= X1) Or in expanded form, X1 - (25 - X1) = 11. So 2X1 - 25 = 11. Solve for X1 by adding 25 to both sides. 2X1 = 11 + 25. 2X1 = 36. Then divide both sides by 2 to solve for X1. 2X1/2 = 36/2. X1 = 18. Now the other number is 25 - X1. Substituting X1 for 18, 25 - 18 = 7.

        " The sum of two numbers is 25 and their difference is 11. What is the larger of the two numbers?\nLet\u2019s think step by step.\nLet a and b be the two numbers. We are given that their sum is 25, so a + b = 25. We are also given that their difference is 11, so a - b = 11.\nWe can solve this system of equations by adding the two equations together. This gets rid of the b term, leaving us with 2a = 36. Divide both sides by 2, and we get a = 18.\nWe can find b by substituting a into one of the original equations. We got a by solving the equation 2a = 36, so substitute a into the equation a + b = 25. 18 + b = 25. Subtract 18 from both sides, and we get b = 7.\nNow, we can find the larger of the two numbers by looking at the values we have for a and b. We have a = 18 and b = 7. The larger number is a = 18.\nThe answer to the problem is that the larger number is 18\nAnswer: The larger of the two numbers is 18. final_answer.png\n1.

Now, we have a system of two linear equations with two unknowns. We can solve for N1 and N2. To solve for N1, we can add N1-N2=11 to N1+N2=25. We get 2N1=36. Now, N1=36/2=18.

From the above solutions we can write that $$x+y=25$$ $$x-y=11$$ Sanity check: $$x+y=51$$ $$x-y=-9$$ For a sanity check, it looks like there are missing solutions.  We have to find out the missing solutions. If we write the equations differently like this $$x+y+2y=25+11$$ $$x+y=36$$ $$2x=36$$ It goes further $$x=18$$ Sanity check: If again, we write $$x+y=36$$ $$x+y-2y=36-11$$ That was super easy, but my answer seemed to be wrong. I notice that my answer no longer makes sense. It makes no sense that $$x+y=36$$ but the problem says that $$x+y=25$$ It seems that it is not addressed in the solution. $$2x=25$$ $$x=12.5$$ To write $$x+y=25$$ $$x+y-11=25-11$$ I am perhaps missing my answer. I am short, so I try solving again. $$x=18$$ $$x-y=11$$ $$x-y+25=18-11+25$$ You might observe I invoke the inequality theorem. It is a probability theorem as the operators guide it back to the problem at hand but I use the methods you provided in combination with solving the above numbers. In the above answer I took the second equation and subtracted the first for another step forward. The outline that we are solving similar in computing 11-11 which is 0. We then add the answer. I believe if you write y+11-25, you will probably lose it because I am fairly sure again, but I am not clear on my wide range technique then the steps we took less and less into better the quantitative technique for that widely suited problems but missing solutions allows us to program the problem's variables.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 18.

We can solve this system by adding the two equations together. $(x + y) + y - x = 25 + 11$ Simplifying, we get $y = 36$.

Since the difference of these two numbers is 11, we have $y-x=11$ $(2)$. We can solve the system $(1)$ and $(2)$ using substitution or elimination method. Let\u2019s use elimination method here. First, we multiply $(1)$ by 1 and $(2)$ by 1. $(1)\\times 1$: $x+y=25$ $(3)$ $(2)\\times 1$: $y-x=11$ $(4)$ Now, we can add $(3)$ and $(4)$: $(3)+(4)$ $x+y+y-x=25+11$ $2y=36$ $y=18$ Now, we substitute $y=18$ into one of equations $(1)$ or $(2)$ to solve for $x$. We\u2019ll choose $(1)$. $(1)$ $x+y=25$ $x+18=25$ $x=25-18$ $x=7$ Hence, we have $y=18$ and $x=7$. The larger number is $y$, so this is equal to $\\boxed{18}$.\nI hope it is the correct solution.
