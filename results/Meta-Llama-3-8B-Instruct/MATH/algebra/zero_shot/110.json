Recall rationalizing the denominator \\[ Sometimes we want to write an expression as the quotient of two polynomials or rational expressions.  When we have a denominator that involves the square root of a nonsquaring expression, we \"rationalize\" that denominator.  In other words, we multiply numerator and denominator by 1, but express that 1 using the conjugate of the denominator.  The conjugate of the denominator is obtained by taking the absolute value of everything in the denominator except for the square root.\n$2 \\sqrt{7}$ is an example of a square root of a nonsquaring expression.\n#### Video Lecture: [\u201cRationalizing the Denominator\u201d](https://vyoba.zeme.wiki/video/transpose-and-conjugate-of-a-rational-number) is available on this topic, presenting the general case.",

Mitch, Today, 11:45 PM (UTC) Is it really a rationalization, if you multiply by $\\frac{\\sqrt7}{\\sqrt7}$ instead of $\\frac{\\sqrt7}{\\sqrt7}=\\sqrt7$? Sure. Then, the proportionality of the area of a square to the square of its side length comes in use for! To find the square root of 7, factoring it down to its prime factors and using the property of roots: \u221a(7) = \u221a(1*7) = \u221a(1)\u221a(7) = 1\u221a(7). Hawking, On May 1, 2020 (UTC) So, the square root of 7 is 1\u221a(7). Without using the property of roots, the square root of 7 could be more difficult to find. While finding the square root of 7 doesn\u2019t involve using this property, it can be done in other ways, and maybe it could. However, cracking open the deeper question of what number very closely approximated the relative size of the state\u2019s population by 1600. Don\u2019t have a valid identity for that method. Write the answer at the end. It is not in this explanation.\nThe square root of 7 is assumed to be constant, and it\u2019s also an analytic function, but it could, in a simpler way. Write the answer. It could help me if you didn\u2019t know. \u221a(7) is just a simplification, using a letter. Never mind",

We have successfully \u201crationalized\u201d the denominator.  Notice that the square root in the denominator is given the opposite sign as the one in the numerator.  This is important for rationalizing the denominator.  Without the negative sign, we would have $\\frac1{\\sqrt7}$, not $\\frac{\\sqrt7}2$. ### Why should I trust your answer? We multiplied by $1$ in the form of $\\frac{\\sqrt7}{{2\\sqrt7}\\cdot\\sqrt7}$, which does not change the value of the expression.

        " Let\u2019s start by simplifying the function.\nFirst, we have $2\\sqrt7=2 \\cdot \\sqrt7$, which can be written as $\\sqrt{4 \\cdot 7}$.\n### Answer: Now we can simplify further.\nSo we have $\\frac1{\\sqrt{4 \\cdot 7}}$. We can also write this as $\\frac{\\sqrt4}{\\sqrt{(4)(7)}}$, simplifying further to get $\\frac2{\\sqrt{4 \\cdot 7}}$ or $\\frac2{2 \\cdot \\sqrt7}$. By canceling out the $\\sqrt 7$, we are left with $\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt7}{7}}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\frac{\\sqrt7}{7}.

        " First, we can rewrite $\\frac1{2\\sqrt7}$ as $\\frac{\\sqrt7}{2\\sqrt7^2}$. It is important to ensure that we have the same denominator in both the numerator and the denominator.",
        " \nWe can realize the denominator by multiplying the fraction by $1$ in the following form:\n$$1=\\frac{\\sqrt7}{\\sqrt7}$$\nNow we can simplify and rationalize the denominator:\n$\\displaystyle\\begin{array}{rcl}\\frac1{2\\sqrt7}&=&\\frac1{2\\sqrt7}\\cdot\\frac{\\sqrt7}{\\sqrt7}\\\\\\\\&=&\\frac{\\sqrt7}{2\\cdot7}\\\\\\\\&=&\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt7}{14}}\\end{array}$",

        " \\[\\frac1{2\\sqrt7} = \\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt7}{14}}\\]\nExplanation by Mathhopper: First, consider the denominator $2\\sqrt7 = 2\\sqrt{7}\\cdot\\frac{\\sqrt7}{\\sqrt7}$. Now, the denominator is becoming $2\\sqrt{7}\\cdot\\frac{\\sqrt7}{\\sqrt7}$, which is $(\\sqrt7)^2$.  Multiplying the numerator with $\\frac{\\sqrt7}{\\sqrt7}$ is not changing the value but make the denominator to be rational. Hence, \\begin{align*}\\frac1{2\\sqrt7} &= \\frac1{2\\sqrt7}\\cdot\\frac{\\sqrt7}{\\sqrt7}\\\\\n&=\\frac{\\sqrt7}{2\\cdot(\\sqrt7)^2} \\\\\n&=\\frac{\\sqrt7}{2\\cdot 7}=\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt7}{14}}.\n\\end{align*}\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\frac{\\sqrt7}{14}. I hope it is correct. '').\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{14}$. I hope it is correct."
