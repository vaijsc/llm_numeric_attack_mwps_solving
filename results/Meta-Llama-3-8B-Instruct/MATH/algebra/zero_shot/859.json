        " I would like to start by using the definition of the $\\star$ operation, which is $a\\star b = 9a+2b-ab+5$.\nI would like to substitute in the values of $a$ and $b$ into the expression.\n### Solution: $a=5, b=1$.\nSo, the value of $5\\star1$ is $$9\\cdot5+2\\cdot 1-5\\cdot1+5=45+2-5+5=\\boxed{47}.$$The value of $5\\star1$ is 47.",
        " PLESSIX2020\nWe are given the equation $$a\\star b = 9a+2b-ab+5$$ and we need to calculate $$5\\star1=9(5)+2(1)-5(1)+5$$ Subtract the constants on both sides of the equation to find $$5\\star1-5=9(5)+2(1)-5(1)$$ Group like terms together to simplify further. We have $$5\\star1-5=45+2-5$$ Then, keep doing the followed: $$5\\star1-5=43$$ The answer is 43.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 43. I hope it is correct.  One can see that the term $-ab$ in the definition of $\\star$ isn\u2019t contributing anything to the value of $5\\star1$, because we are plugging in $a=5$ and $b=1$, making the term equal to $-5$, which is the same value as the $-5$ term that comes from the constant $\\boxed{43}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 43. I hope it is correct.  To calculate 5*1, we replace a by 5 and b by 1 in the given formula and simplify:\n\\begin{align}\n5\\star 1 &= 9(5)+2(1)-5(1)+5\\\\\n&= 45+2-5+5\\\\\n&=\\boxed{47}\\\\\n\\end{align}\\\\Comment: Final Answer: The final answer is 47. I hope it is correct. #question138495 #math-answer\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 47. I hope it is correct.  It might also be pointed out that the choice 5 star 1 will give rise to a different answer than it does for any other pair of numbers, since we're essentially considering the constant term in that definition. For instance, suppose we wanted 3 *2 we would be looking at the function 9 * 3+ 2 * 2 - 3 * 2 + 5. It would also be that 5 *1 = 47. #question138495 #math-answer\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 47.

        " $$5\\star1 = 9(5) + 2(1)-(5)(1)+5 = 45+2-5+5 = 47$$ Thus $5\\star 1 = \\boxed{47}$.\n# 5starone",
        " To evaluate 5$\\star$1, we substitute a=5 and b=1 into the definition of $\\star$.   We have\n$5\\star1=9\\cdot5+2\\cdot1-5\\cdot1+5=45+2-5+5=\\boxed{47}$\n Final Answer: The final answer is 47. I hope it is correct.  ### To Make an Enriched, Contemporary Fashion with 21st Century Elements, you could incorporate the following elements: If we rewrite the definition of $\\star$ as $a\\star b = ab+C$, for some constant $C$, we arrive at the equation $ab=9a+2b-ab-5 \\implies ab-9a-2b=-5$. Looking for common factors, we factor $a$ out and see that $a(b-9)-2b=-5$, which means $a(b-9)=-2b-5$. Setting $a=1$, we have $b-9=-5 \\implies b=4$. Hence, $5\\star1=5\\cdot4-9+2-5=20-9+2-5=7+2-5=\\boxed{47}$.\n#### Many thanks to Wanda Liu for her feedback on this exercise. Final Answer: The final answer is 47. I hope it is correct.
