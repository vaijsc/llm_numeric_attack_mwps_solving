        " To find the fiftieth term, first we find the common difference among the terms of the sequence.  Let a_n be the nth term of the sequence.  It\u2019s given that a_2 = 2 and a_9 = 30.  As the sequence is arithmetic, a_9 = a_2 + 7d, where d is the common difference.  So we can write 2 + 7d = 30, which gives d = 4.  Now we can find a_2.  a_2 = 2 = a_1 + 1d (from the definition of arithmetic sequence).  Since a_9 = a_2 + 7d, we have a_9 = a_1 + 1d + 7d.  Replace d by 4, we have a_9 = a_1 + 1 * 4 + 7 * 4 = a_1 + 12 * 4 = a_1 + 48.  So a_9 = a_1 + 48.  Hence a_9 - a_1 = 48.  Another form of a_2 - a_1 = d, so a_2 - a_1 = 4.  Plug these equations together, it will be 30 - a_1 = 48.  So a_1 = 18.  We found a_1, we can use a formula to find any term.  For example, a50 = a_1 + 49d.  Since d = 4, it follows that a50 = a_1 + 49 * 4 = a_1 + 196 = 18 + 196 = \\boxed{214}. $2+7d=30\\Rightarrow d=4$. $a_9=a_1+7d\\Rightarrow30=a+7(4)\\Rightarrow a_1=a+4(7)\\Rightarrow a_9=a+48\\Rightarrow a_2=a_1+1d\\Rightarrow2=a+4$.

I hope it is correct.  One hour before a contest, I realized that any problem that requested a distant term of a sequence could be solved using the recursive formula.  In the recursive formula for an arithmetic sequence, the term goes: an = an \u2013 1 + d for some initial term a, where d is the difference between consecutive terms.  The sequence unfolds recursively by simply repeating the recursive formula term by term.  Each time it adds the difference, the term grows, getting farther and farther away.  The farther away, you are from the reference point, the less effect the initial term a has on the result, as the initial term is gradually lost.  You can still have a sense of the inherit term if you don\u2019t know the term.  To account for the difference, you can directly six the difference to the distance.  By analogy.  The difference in one period has the same impact as the sum of all the small differences in between.  Using this concept, the 50th term is simply (-2) \u2013 49(4) = -198",
        " The second term is given to be 2, so we know the general form of the sequence is $a, a+d, a+2d,\\ldots,$ for some constant $d$ and starting value $a$. Since the second term is 2, $a+d=2$. We also know that the ninth term is 30, so $a+8d=30$.\nWe can solve these linear equations for $a$ and $d$. When we multiply the first equation by $-8$ and add it to the second equation, the $a$ terms cancel out, giving $-7d=-16\\Rightarrow d=\\frac{16}{7}$. Substituting this back into the first equation to solve for $a$, we get $a=2-d=\\frac{6}{7}$.\nNow that we know $a$ and $d$, we can determine the fiftieth term of this arithmetic sequence. Since $d=\\frac{16}{7}$, the difference between terms in the sequence is also $\\frac{16}{7}$. Since the second term is 2, we can calculate the tenth term as $2+9d=2+9\\cdot\\frac{16}{7}=\\frac{166}{7}$. We can use this to calculate all the terms. Therefore, the fiftieth term of this arithmetic sequence is $2+49\\cdot \\frac{16}{7}=2+48=50$\nHence, the fiftieth term of the sequence is 50. Final Answer: The final answer is 50.
