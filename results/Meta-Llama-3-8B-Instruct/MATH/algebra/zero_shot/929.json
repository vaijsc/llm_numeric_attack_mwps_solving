Since this is correct, we need to determine if this method is the most efficient way or not. Using this statement, we can compare the methods and suggest the most efficient way. Furthermore, we can ask the user choose the most efficient method from the following methods.\n\u2022  State the value of a-b in terms of $n$ without simplifying.\n\u2022 Change the value of a to -1 and solve.\n\u2022 Write the given expression in terms of $a$ and $b$, keeping $a$ and $b$ expressing decimals as integers.\nNow, we can choose the most efficient way based on the user\u2019s choice. We will suggest choosing the solution. Simplifying the expression is a easy and efficient method. This method is more efficient because it only needs one step. In contrast, changing the value of a to -1 requires two steps, and expressing decimals as integers is unnecessary. We can recommend using the first method.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -41. I hope it is correct. Now, the final step is to propose the best option based on the user\u2019s response. If you find it accurate, consider the first option, which is the most efficient method.

After some calculations, we find $-1-25-15=-41$.\n### Final Answer: $-41 orfter $-4$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -41 orfter -4. I hope it is correct.  We get: $-a^2 + 3ab -b^2$. Substitute for $a = -1$ and for $b = 5$. We get: $-((-1)^2) + 3((-1)(5)) - 5^2$. We get: $-1 - (-15) - 25$. We get: $-1 + 15 - 25$. We get: $-36$.  Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{-36}$.  Now we substitute into our expression, we get:\n\\begin{align*}\n-a-b^2+3ab&=-1-5^2+3(-1)(5)\\\\\n&=-1-25-3(5)\\\\\n&=-1-25-15\\\\\n&=\\boxed{-41}\n\\end{align*}We are to",
        " $-a-b^2+3ab = -(-1)-5^2+3(-1)(5) = 1-25-15 = \\boxed{-39}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -39. I hope it is correct. 19. Let $\\mathbf{A} = \\begin{pmatrix} a & -b\\\\ b & a \\end{pmatrix}$. Then $\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{A} = \\begin{pmatrix} a & -b\\\\ b & a \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a & -b\\\\ b & a \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a^2 - b^2 & -ab + ab\\\\ ab + ba & b^2 - a^2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a^2 - b^2 & 0\\\\ 0 & b^2 - a^2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a^2 - b^2 & 0\\\\ 0 & b^2 - a^2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe value of $a^2 - b^2$ can be written as $(a + b)(a - b)$ by difference of squares.\nSo, we have $\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{A} = \\begin{pmatrix} (a + b)(a - b) & 0\\\\ 0 & (a + b)(a - b) \\end{pmatrix}$.\nSo, $\\det(\\mathbf{A}) = \\sqrt{\\det(\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{A})} = \\sqrt{(a + b)(a - b)(a + b)(a - b)} = \\sqrt{(a^2 - b^2)^2} = |a^2 - b^2| = \\boxed{|a - b| |a + b|}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is |a - b| |a + b|.

        " \u00a0-1 - 25 + 3(-1)(5) = -36\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -36. I hope it is correct.  Math Let us begin! The given two numbers are $a=-1$ and $b=5$. To solve, let us follow the order of operations (PEMDAS) and plug in the values of $a$ and $b$. \\begin{align*} -a-b^2+3ab &= -(-1)-5^2+3(-1)(5) \\\\ &= 1-25-15 \\\\ &= \\boxed{-36} \\\\ \\end{align*} Therefore, the value of $-a-b^2+3ab$ if $a=-1$ and $b=5$ is $-36$. Analyzing the solution: This is equivalent to saying that the solution is a combination of the subtraction, square, and multiplication of the given numbers, which is what one might anticipate based upon his/her overall knowledge of number manipulation. Additionally, each step in the solution is carefully taken, and therefore, no misunderstandings can occur when applying the respective mathematical operations.
