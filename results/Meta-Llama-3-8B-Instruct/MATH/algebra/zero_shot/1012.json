Since we are only interested in positive integers, we need to find values of \\( x \\) such that the inequality \\( x^2 < 1 \\) holds. \nThe positive integers start from 1 and increase upwards (1, 2, 3, ...).

I hope it is correct. posted Sep 21, 2013  If $x$ is a real number, then $x^{-1}$ is the reciprocal of $x$; i.e., the result of flipping $x$ over the $y$-axis.  If $x$ is positive, the line $y=x$ lies above the $x$-axis in the first quadrant.  Therefore, we want to find the $x$-values such that the line $y=\\frac{1}{x}$ lies above $y=x$.  As $x$ ranges over the positive real numbers, $\\frac{1}{x}$ reduces to $0$ and increases beyond infinity.  Therefore, there are only a few values of $x$ that have their reciprocals greater than themselves.  We should check values of $x$ in the following sequence: $1, 2, 3, \\ldots$, and stop when we find the first one where $x>\\frac{1}{x}$.
