The librarian noticed that on average, 30% of the items checked out of the library fail to be returned.  She also discovered that 20% of the unreturned items are lost forever (i.e., they are destroyed or stolen) and the remaining 80% are recovered by the library after some time. If money were not a concern, which option would you recommend to improve the cataloging and organizing system, and why?",

        " First, evaluate $\\boxed{\\left(\\frac{i}{2}\\right)^2=\\frac{i^2}{4}=\\frac{-1}{4}.}$\n### Solution:\nLet's think step by step. \nWe need to find the square of $\\dfrac{i}{2}$. We know that $i^2 = -1$, and then we can write\n$$\\left(\\frac{i}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{i^2}{4} = \\frac{-1}{4}.$$So, our answer is $\\dfrac{i}{2}$ square is $\\boxed{\\dfrac{-1}{4}}$.",
        " Substituting $i^2=-1$ from Note 1, we get $\\left(\\frac{i}{2}\\right)^2=\\frac{i^2}{4}=-\\frac{1}{4}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -\\frac{1}{4}.
