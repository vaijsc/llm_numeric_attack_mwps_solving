        " The degree of a polynomial is the highest degree (i.e., the highest power of $t$) of the terms in the polynomial. The highest degree of a polynomial is often referred to as its degree.\nIn this case, the degree of $p(t)$ is 7 because it has the term $a_7t^7$ for some nonzero real number $a_7$, and similarly, the degree of $q(t)$ is 7.  Since the product of any polynomial and another polynomial has at most the degree of the sum of their degrees, the degree of $p(t)\\cdot q(t)$ is at most $\\boxed{7}$.\nTo make sure that $p(t)\\cdot q(t)$ actually has degree 7, we need the coefficients advertised in $p(t)$ and $q(t)$ to survive in the product term $a_7t^7$. Since they do, the degree of $p(t)\\cdot q(t)$ is in fact $\\boxed{7}$.\n### Note: Another way to look at this is the following: when we multiply $p(t)$ and $q(t)$ together, we are essentially multiplying two sets of terms together from the terms of $p(t)$ and $q(t)$. The highest power of $t$ when multiplying these terms is a product of $t^{a}$ times $t^{b}$ where $a$ and $b$ are the highest powers of $t$ in $p(t)$ and $q(t)$, respectively. This is a term of the form $t^{a+b}$ which has the highest power of $t$, hence is the highest degree of the product $p(t)q(t)$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 7. I hope it is correct.",
        " The degree of a polynomial in $t$ is defined as the highest power of $t$ that appears in the polynomial when it is expressed in the form $at^n+bt^{n-1}+\\cdots+k$.  By that definition, $\\deg p(t)=\\deg q(t)=7$.  As a consequence of the fact that the product of two polynomials has degree equal to the sum of the degrees of the individual polynomials, we know that the degree of $p(t)\\cdot q(t)$ is $\\deg p(t)+\\deg q(t)=7+7=\\boxed{14}$, which is another way of saying that the highest power of $t$ that appears in their product is also $t^{14}$.\nNote that the degree of a polynomial times a constant is still the same degree, but the degree of a polynomial divided by a constant is the same if the constant is not zero, and if the constant is zero, then the polynomial has degree zero.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 14. I hope it is correct. Thanks for watching. \n",
        " \n$$\\boxed{\\text{degree 14}}$$\nThe degree of a monomial is the sum of the degrees of its factors, and the degree of a polynomial is the maximum degree of its monomials. When we multiply a polynomial $p(t)$ of degree $m$ by a polynomial $q(t)$ of degree $n$, the degree of the product is at most $m+n$. Since we are told that $m=n=7$, the degree of the product is at most $7+7=\\boxed{14}$. If you believe that $p(t)$ and $q(t)$ could have some terms that cancel each other, this formula still gives the correct answer because only the leading terms affect the degree.  It would be comforting to actually determine $p(t)$ and $q(t)$ and write out their product, to verify the answer $\\boxed{14}$.  The first problem we have with this idea is that there are many possible seventh-degree polynomials in $t$.  So, how can we choose any one to call $p(t)$ and another one to call $q(t)$?  A moment's thought leads to the idea of using the Straightforward Approach described in paragraph $5.$ It\u2019s possible that there is a clever way to get a seventh-degree polynomial with a specific leading term and no lower-degree terms, or perhaps really low-degree terms.

        " Since both $p(t)$ and $q(t)$ are seventh-degree polynomials in $t$, each of these polynomials will have a term of the form $at^7$ where $a$ is some constant.  This means that when you multiply the two polynomials together, you will get polynomials of degrees $7+7=14, 7+6=13,$ $7+5=12$, and so on, up to $0$.  So, the polynomial $p(t)\\cdot q(t)$ is an eighteenth-degree polynomial in $t$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 18. I hope it is correct. \u00a0######\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 18.

        " The problem is asking us to find the degree of $p(t)\\cdot q(t)$. It is saying that both $p(t)$ and $q(t)$ are seventh-degree polynomials in $t$.\n    - That means $p(t) = a_7 t^7 + a_6 t^6 + a_5 t^5 + a_4 t^4 + a_3 t^3 + a_2 t^2 + a_1 t + a_0$ where $a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6, a_7$ are constants. Likewise, $q(t) = b_7 t^7 + b_6 t^6 + b_5 t^5 + b_4 t^4 + b_3 t^3 + b_2 t^2 + b_1 t + b_0$ where $b_0, b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4, b_5, b_6, b_7$ are constants.\n    - We can multiply $p(t)$ and $q(t)$ together and we will have: $$p(t)\\cdot q(t) = a_7 t^7 + a_6 t^6 + a_5 t^5 + a_4 t^4 + a_3 t^3 + a_2 t^2 + a_1 t + a_0\\cdot (b_7 t^7 + b_6 t^6 + b_5 t^5 + b_4 t^4 + b_3 t^3 + b_2 t^2 + b_1 t + b_0)$$\n    - Simplifying the above equation we have: $$p(t)\\cdot q(t) = (a_7 b_7) t^{14} + (a_7 b_6 + a_6 b_7) t^{13} + (a_7 b_5 + a_6 b_6 + a_5 b_7) t^{12} + \\cdots + (a_1 b_0 + a_0 b_1) t + a_0 b_0$$\n    - This is an $(1\\cdot 8) = 8^{th}$ degree polynomial. That means, the degree of $p(t)\\cdot q(t",
        " So, because p(t) and q(t) are both seventh-degree polynomials in t, they can be written in the form p(t)= at^n +bt^(n-1)+... +k, and q(t)=ct^(n-1)+dt^(n-2)+... where the degrees of p(t) and q(t) are both n = 7.\nSince $p(t) = at^n + bt^(n-1) + ... + k$ is the seventh-degree polynomial, its highest degree is 7, so $n = 7$.\nSimilarly, $q(t) = ct^(n-1) + dt^(n-2) + ...$ is the seventh-degree polynomial, its highest degree is also 7, so $n = 7$ again.\nIf we multiply these $p(t)$ and $q(t)$, we have\np(t)\\cdot q(t)=(a\\cdot c)t^{n+n-1}+(a\\cdot d)t^{n+n-2}+...+(b\\cdot c)t^{n-1+n-1}+(b\\cdot d)t^{n-1+n-2}+...\nLet\u2019s examine the term of the highest degree in the expansion of $p(t)\\cdot q(t)$ in $t$. The highest term comes from the product of the $n^{th}$ degree term in $p(t)$ and $n^{th}$ degree term in $q(t)$.\nSo, the highest-degree term is $a\\cdot c t^{n+n-1} = at^{7+7-1} = at^{13}$. This means the degree of $p(t)\\cdot q(t)$ is 13.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 13. I hope it is correct. ### ",
        " The degree of $p(t)$ is 7 (since it is a seventh-degree polynomial). Similarly, the degree of $q(t)$ is 7. If we multiply the terms of both polynomials together, we will have $7+7=14$ terms, which means that the degree of $p(t)q(t)$ is 14. Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{14}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 14. I hope it is correct. Let me know if you have any doubt. I will be happy to help.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 14.
