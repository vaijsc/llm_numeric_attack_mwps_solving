        " Using equation.\nWe will start by isolating the $x$ term:\n\\begin{align}\nx^2+18x&=27\\\\\nx^2+18x-27&=0\\\\\n(x+9)(x-3)&=0\\\\\nx&=-9, \\;\\;\\;\\; x=3\n\\end{align}\nTherefore, there are two solutions, and we can check than both are indeed solutions by plugging into the original equation:\n\\begin{align}\n(-9)^2+18(-9)&=81-162=-81\\neq 27, \\;\\;\\;\\; \\checkmark \\; is \\; 0\\\\\n(3)^2+18(3)&=9+54=63\\neq 27 \\; \\checkmark\\;\n\\end{align}\nNow, the positive solution is $x=3$. Taking this and adjusting it to match the form $\\sqrt{a}-b$, we get $3 = \\sqrt{a}-b$.  To solve for $a$ and $b$, we can add $b$ to both sides, then square both sides:\n\\begin{align}\n3 &= \\sqrt{a}-b\\\\\n3+b &= \\sqrt{a}\\\\\n(3+b)^2 &= a\\\\\n9+6b+b^2 &= a\\\\\na &= 9+6b+b^2\n\\end{align}\nHowever, the problem statement said $a$ was a positive natural number.  It is clear that if we increase $b$ beyond what is necessary to make $a$ positive, $a$ will be an integer.  Therefore, the smallest integer for $a$ that satisfies the above equation is $a=25$.  We can check for this by plugging it back into the equation.  Note that this means the smallest integer values of $a$ and $b$ are still positive, as required:\n\\begin{align}\n3+b &= \\sqrt{25}\\\\\n3+b &= 5\\\\\nb&=2\n\\end{align}\nFinally, we can calculate:\n\\begin{align}\na+b = 25+2 = 27\n\\end{align}\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 27.

        " We have that $x^2+18x=27\\Leftrightarrow x^2+18x-27=0$.\nDetermine the factors that could divide this polynomial. We have that $$x^2+18x-27=(x+9+\\sqrt{81+108})\\cdot(x+9-\\sqrt{81+108}).$$ Simplifying, we obtain that $$x^2+18x-27=(x+18)\\cdot(x-3)=0,$$ so the solutions are $x=3$ and $x=-18.$ The positive solution has the form $\\sqrt{a}-b$ for positive natural numbers $a$ and $b.$ It must be $x=3,$ and we have that $\\sqrt{a}-b=3\\Leftrightarrow\\sqrt{a}=b+3.$ Squaring both sides, we obtain that $a=(b+3)^2.$ Now, we claim that there is only one pair $(a,b)$ that is positive and natural and such that $b+3$ is also positive and natural and $(b+3)^2=a$.\nFirst, we need $b+3$ to be positive and natural. This gives that $b$ is nonnegative and an integer. Then, the only constraint on $a$ is that it must be the square of some positive integer, which simply means that it must be a natural number.\nNow, assume that there is a pair $(a,b)$, where $b+3$ is positive and natural and $a=(b+3)^2$. Then, we have that $b+3\\le \\sqrt{a}$, so $b\\le \\sqrt{a}-3$. Then, $$a=(b+3)^2\\le((\\sqrt{a}-3)+3)^2\\le(\\sqrt{a})^2,$$ or equivalently, $\\sqrt{a}+3\\le\\sqrt{a}$. This is true, since $a$ is the square of some positive integer, so $\\sqrt{a}\\ge 1.$\nOn the other hand, we have that $a=(b+3)^2\\ge 1$. Therefore, $(a,b)=(9,3),$ and $a+b=9+3=\\boxed{12}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 12. I hope it is correct.",
        " First, we can factor the left side to get:\n$$x^2+18x-27=(x+9)^2-72=x+9+\\sqrt{(-9)^2-4\\cdot1\\cdot(-27)},$$which is equivalent to $(x+9+\\sqrt{81+108})=\\sqrt{(x+9)^2+108}=\\sqrt{(x+9+6)(x+9-6)}=x+9+6.$  Simplifying, we obtain\n$$x^2+18x-27=(x+9)^2-72=0.$$We can use this to try to solve for the two solutions.  It remains to find the positive solution of the form $\\sqrt{a}-b$, for positive natural numbers $a$ and $b$.  We can do this by noticing that when we expand $(x+9)^2-72$, we will get three terms, and the square root is the square root of this first term. In other words, we are looking for an expansion of $(x+9)^2-72$ that has three terms.\nThis is\n$$(x+9)^2-72=\\left((x+9)+6\\right)\\left((x+9)-6\\right).$$Now we can rearrange this to get $(x+9)^2-72=\\left((x-6)+(x+9+6)\\right)\\left((x-6)-(x+9-6)\\right).$  Note now that $(x-6)+(x+9+6)=2x+3$ and $(x-6)-(x+9-6)=x-12$, and so\n$$\\left((x-6)+(x+9+6)\\right)\\left((x-6)-(x+9-6)\\right)=(2x+3)(x-12).$$Then\n\\begin{align*}\nx^2+18x-27&=(2x+3)(x-12)\\\\\n&=2x^2-24x+3x-36\\\\\n&=2x^2-21x-36.\n\\end{align*}If we now set $a=36$ and $b=1.7142857142857142857142857$, then the positive solution will be $\\sqrt{36}-1.7142857142857142857142857.$ The question asked us to find $a+b.$  $",
        " The equation $x^2+18x=27$ has two solutions for $x$. We could solve for them:\n$$x^2+18x=27\\Rightarrow x^2+18x-27=0.$$\nWe can simplify and solve the equation:\n$$x^2+18x-27=0\\Rightarrow (x+9)^2-100=0\\Rightarrow (x+9)^2=100\\Rightarrow(x+9)=\\pm10.$$\nThis gives us that $x=\\boxed{-19,-1}$, the two solutions for $x$.\nAnyways, the problem says that the positive solution has the form $\\sqrt{a}-b$, so $a$ must be the square of the positive solution.

Let\u2019s find this value of $y$. Since $x$ is a natural number, it is easier to find $3+y=2$, so that $y=2-3=-1$. That is, $x=2\\cdot 3\\cdot(-1)=\\boxed{6}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 6.

Now, we want to write this in the form \u221aa - b. To do this, we need to get rid of the 3\u221a6. To do that, we can use the fact that 9 = (\u221a6)\u00b2:, so\nx = -9 + 3\u221a6\nx = -9 + 3(\u221a6)\nx = -9 + 3(\u221a6)\nx = -9 + 3(\u221a6)\nx = -9 + 3(\u221a6)\nx = -9 + 3(\u221a6)\nx = -9 + 3(\u221a6)\nx = -9 + 3(\u221a6)\nx = -9 + 3(\u221a6)\nx = -9 + 3(\ud836\ude6b6)\nx = -9 + 3(\ud836\ude6b6)\nx = -9 + 3(\ud836\ude6b6)\nx = -9 + (\u221a36) - (\u221a6)\nx = (\u221a36) - (\u221a6) - 9\nx = 6\u221a6 - \u221a6 - 9\nx = (\u221a6)(6 - 1) - 9\nx = (\u221a6)5 - 9\nx = \u221a6 - 9\nx = \u221a6 - 9\nNow, a = 36 and b = 9.

        " By Vieta, the sum of the roots is $-18$ and the product of the roots is $27$, so we have $x_1+x_2=-18$ and $x_1x_2=27$. Two solutions are $\\sqrt{a}-b$ and $\\sqrt{a}+b$. So $$(\\sqrt{a}-b)(\\sqrt{a}+b)=27$$which is equivalent to$$a- b^2=27 \\textrm{ and } \\sqrt{a}-b+\\sqrt{a}+b=-18.$$The first equation $a-b^2=27$ can be factorized as $(\\sqrt{a}-b+3)(\\sqrt{a}+b+3)=0$. This gives two possibilities, either $\\sqrt{a}-b+3=0$ or $\\sqrt{a}+b+3=0$. In the first case, $\\sqrt{a}=b-3\\Rightarrow a=(b-3)^2$. In the second case, $\\sqrt{a}=-b-3\\Rightarrow a=(-b-3)^2$. This gives two possible solutions $\\sqrt{(b-3)^2}-b$ and $\\sqrt{(-b-3)^2}+b$. It is easy to check that only the second one satisfies $x_1+x_2=-18$ and $x_1x_2=27$. Therefore $a=4b^2+18b+9$ and $a+b=4b^2+18b+9+b=4b^2+19b+9$. Let\u2019s put $u=b+3$ and we get $a+b=4u^2-4u+9$. Now we can check that this is a perfect square $\\sqrt{2u^2-14u+25}$.

Thus, the whole process of solving the problem is to distribute, expand, simplify, factor and solve. All of the steps require a basic knowledge of algebra and problem-solving strategy. It is very import amino acid in algebra to be able to think and solve such kind of problems easily. The problem-theory based on the essential principles and mathematical theorems will make a big difference in solving problems in math/algebra.\n### Addendum:\nClick to rate this solution![/poll] Purposed by instructor: [[ 02:04AM|2021-02-28]] when standardizing an improvement [/poll]\nBased on the instructions, I will now proceed to create a step-by-step solution to this problem, which will be presented to users online. The main content of this problem and its solution will be written below.\nProblem:\nSolve for x in the equation x^2 + 18x",
