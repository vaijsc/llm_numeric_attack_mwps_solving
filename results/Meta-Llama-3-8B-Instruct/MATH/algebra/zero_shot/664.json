        " There are several ways to solve this problem. We can try factoring and see if it\u2019s a perfect square, or we can use the quadratic formula. Sometimes there are things that work better or worse in each of these methods. These are the possibilities:\n* To factor this equation, we look for numbers whose product is $128$ and whose sum is $24$. Unfortunately, $16$ and $8$ have product $128$, but their sum is $24$. So that won\u2019t work.\n* To use the quadratic formula, we have $a=1$, $b=24$, and $c=128$. The formula is $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$.

To learn more about solving other types of math problems, you can check out our website for more resources. Stay curious and happy learning! SQL Server 2022 and earlier, you can use the `CASE` statement with a `WHEN` and an `THEN` clause to generate a new column based on a condition. For example, you can use the following SQL Server query to generate a column that displays a greeting based on the current time of day:\n```\nSELECT\n   efa.*,\n    CASE\n        WHEN DATEPART(HOUR, GETDATE()) < 12 THEN 'Good morning'\n        WHEN DATEPART(HOUR, GETDATE()) BETWEEN 12 AND 17 THEN 'Good afternoon'\n        ELSE 'Good evening'\n    END AS Greeting\nFROM\n    efa;\n```\nThis query uses the `DATEPART` function to get the current hour and then uses a `CASE` statement with three conditions: one for morning, one for afternoon, and one for evening. The resulting column, `Greeting`, contains the greeting based on the current time of day.\nIn SQL Server 2022 and later, you can use a more concise syntax using the `IIF` function, which is similar to the `CASE` statement but more compact. For example:\n```\nSELECT\n    efa.*,\n    IIF(DATEPART(HOUR, GETDATE()) < 12, 'Good morning', \n         IIF(DATEPART(HOUR, GETDATE()) BETWEEN 12 AND 17, 'Good afternoon', 'Good evening')) AS Greeting\nFROM\n    efa;\n```\nBoth of these examples generate a new column `Greeting` based on the current time of day and display the greeting accordingly.",
