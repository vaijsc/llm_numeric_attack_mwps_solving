        " \nLet's solve this step by step:\n1. We know that the tree is initially 12 feet tall and we want it to be 36 feet tall.\n2. The tree grows 18 inches a year which is 1.5 feet a year (18 inches / 12 = 1.5 feet).\n3. To find the number of years it takes for the tree to grow from 12 feet to 36 feet, we need to find how many times 1.5 feet will fit into the remaining height the tree needs to grow.\n4. The tree needs to grow an additional 36 - 12 = 24 feet.\n5. Divide the additional height by the rate of growth: 24 feet / 1.5 feet/year = 16 years.\nTherefore, it will take 16 years for the tree to grow to be 36 feet tall. ",
        " \nFirst, we need to convert the yearly growth from inches to feet. 18 inches = 1.5 feet (inches have 12 equal parts in a foot, so 18 inches is 1.5 * 12 = 1.5 feet)\nThe tree currently is 12 feet tall. It grows 1.5 feet each year. So to get from 12 feet to 36 feet, the tree needs to grow 36 - 12 = 24 feet more.\nHow many years will it take for the tree to grow 24 feet, if it grows 1.5 feet per year? 24 / 1.5 = 16\nSo it will take 16 years for the tree to grow an additional 24 feet and reach a height of 36 feet. The answer is 16. ",
        "\\\nStep 1: Think about how much the tree grows per year. Remember, the tree grows 18 inches per year.\n#### Convert 18 inches to feet to make it easier to work with. 18 inches is $\\frac{18}{12}$ = 1.5 feet per year.\nStep 2: Think about how much the tree needs to grow to reach 36 feet. The tree needs to grow 36 - 12 = 24 feet.\nStep 3: Think about how many years it will take the tree to grow 24 feet. To find out, we can divide the amount of growth needed (24 feet) by the amount the tree grows per year (1.5 feet).\n#### The answer is 16.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 16. I hope it is correct. ### Teachers' Resourcesheet to accompany the lesson ### **Extension:** Ask students to compare the rate at which the tree grows with a different tree that grows at a different rate. How long would it take this new tree to reach 36 feet? Can they find any real-life examples of how rates of growth can affect our environment? Can they discuss the impact of climate change on the growth of trees, other plants, and organisms? The rates of growth in this scenario are relatively straightforward, but in real-life scenarios, the rates of change can be more complex. Encourage students to think critically about how these rates affect the environment and our daily lives. To review the concepts, have students work in pairs or small groups to solve these scenarios: 1. A flower is 6 inches tall and grows 1 inch per week. How many weeks will it take for the flower to reach 12 inches tall? 2. A fish is 10 pounds and grows 0.5 pounds per month. How many months will it take for the fish to reach 16 pounds? 3. A car accelerates from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 12 seconds. What is its speed increase per second? 4. A population of rabbits grows from 100 to 150 in 5 years. What is the average growth rate of the population per year? These scenarios encourage students to apply their understanding of rates to a variety of real-life situations. They can also lead to interesting discussions about how rates of change affect our world. ### **Formative Assessment** Use the following questions to check for understanding during the lesson: 1.

Given that it grows 18 inches in one year, let the number of years required be x.\nThe current height of the tree in inches is 144 and required height is 36 * 12 = 432 ( convert feet to inches). We can find the value of x as follows:\n144 + 18x = 432\nSubtracting 144 from both sides, we get: \n18x = 288\nDividing both sides by 18, we get:\nx = 288/18\nx = 16\nSo, in x = 16 years, the tree will grow and become 36 feet tall. So, the answer is **16 years**.",
        " \nIt is helpful to convert everything to a common unit. We can convert the current height of the tree from feet to inches, by multiplying by 12. So, 12 feet is 144 inches.\nThen we can convert the rate of growth from inches to feet, by dividing by 12. So, the rate of growth is 18/12 = 3/2 feet per year.\nNow we want to know how long it will take for the tree to grow from 144 inches to 432 inches. Let\u2019s write an equation.\n144 + (3/2)t = 432\nWe can solve this by subtracting 144 from both sides.\n(3/2)t = 288\nNow we can multiply both sides by 2/3.\nt = 288 * 2/3\nt = 192/3\nt = 64\nSo, it will take the tree 64 years to grow from 12 feet to 36 feet. ",
        " Let\u2019s set up an equation to model this situation. Let y be the number of years the tree takes to grow from 12 feet tall to 36 feet tall. Since the tree grows 18 inches per year, it grows 18/12 = 1.5 feet per year.\n### So we can write: 12 + 1.5y = 36\n### By subtracting 12 from both sides, we get: 1.5y = 24\n### And by dividing both sides by 1.5, we get: y = 24/1.5 = 16\n### It will take the tree 16 years to grow from 12 feet tall to 36 feet tall.",
        " We need a difference of 36 - 12 = 24 feet from the tree to reach 36 feet. Since the tree grows 18 inches per year, that is 1.5 feet per year.\nLet\u2019s divide the remaining feet by 1.5 which is 24 \u00f7 1.5 = 16.",
        " \nTo determine the number of years needed for the tree to grow from 12 feet to 36 feet, we can subtract the initial height from the final height and divide the result by the annual growth rate.\nInitial height = 12 feet\nFinal height = 36 feet\nGrowth rate = 18 inches/year = 1.5 feet/year (since 18 inches is equivalent to 1.5 feet)\nHeight growth needed = Final height - Initial height = 36 feet - 12 feet = 24 feet\nNow, divide the height growth needed by the growth rate to find the number of years needed:\nNumber of years = Height growth needed / Growth rate = 24 feet / 1.5 feet/year = 16 years\nTherefore, the tree will be 36 feet tall in 16 years. ",
        " To solve this problem, we will use a strategy of solving the problem by working backwards. We want to know in how many years the tree will be 36 feet tall, so we can start by thinking about how high it currently is. Because it's 12 feet now, and growing 18 inches per year, we can divide 18 inches to find out how many years it has been growing.\n12 feet x 12 inches/feet = 144 inches\n144 inches - 2 feet * 12 = 144 - 24 = 120\nSo it\u2019s been growing for 10 years. It will grow 120 inches in the next 5 years!\nLet\u2019s calculate it:\n1. Convert 5 years * 18 inches/year = 90 inches\n2. 120 inches + 90 inches = 210 inches\n3. Convert 210 inches back to feet:\n210 inches/12 inches/feet = 17.5 feet\nSo, in 15 years, the tree will be 17.5 feet tall. Subtract 12 from that, we get 5.5. To add 5.5 feet to 36, we can do 36 - 12 + 5.5 = 36.\n#### Answer: 15 years will be the answer.\nLet\u2019s try another one!\nWhat do you think about it?

        " 18 inches \u2261 1.5 feet, so the height increases by 1.5 feet per year. Currently, the tree is 12 feet tall. To\nincrease its height by 24 feet to become 36 feet tall, the tree will need 24 / 1.5 = 16 years to achieve this height.\nTherefore, the tree will be 36 feet tall in 16 years. \nFinal Answer: The final answer is 16. I hope it is correct._manager_password",
        " First, we can write down a conversion factor: 1 foot = 12 inches. Then, we can set up an equation to represent the situation: $12 + 18n = 36,$ where $n$ is the number of years. Solving for $n$, we have:\n$18n = 24 \\implies n = \\boxed{4}$ years.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 4. I hope it is correct.",
        "  Let y be the number of years needed for the tree to be 36 feet tall. When that happens, the tree\u2019s height will be increased by 18 inches * y = 18 y inches. So, the equation becomes,\n36 = 12 + 3/2y.\nFor simplicity, we refactor the equation as follows:\n36 - 12 = 3/2 y\n24 = 3/2 y\nTo solve for y now, we multiply both sides by 2/3 to eliminate the fraction.\n2/3 * 24 = 2/3 * 3/2 y\ny = 2 * 24/3\ny = 16\nSo, it will take 16 years for the tree to grow 12 meters tall.\n### Explanation and Analysis:\nWe solved a simple equation that involved time, parts, and dimensions. We started with a problem statement: In how many years will a tree grow from 12 feet to 36 feet? We used the information given in the problem, that the tree grows 18 inches a year, which is equivalent to 3 inches * 2/3 = 1.5 feet per year, as a conversion factor to find the number of years.\nWe then set up the equation 36 = 12 + 3/2y to model the situation. From this equation, we solved for y after simplifying the right side of the equation. We multiplied both sides by 2/3 to eliminate the fraction and solve for y. Finally, we found that y = 16 years.\n### Conclusion:\nThe solution to this problem involves understanding the conversion between inches and feet, using the given rate of growth, and solving a simple equation using algebraic manipulations. This problem allows for a clear and straightforward application of mathematical concepts to real-life situations, because it asks a question that can be answered using mathematical techniques.

        " First, I convert 18 inches to feet. 18 inches = 1.5 feet. The tree grows 1.5 feet each year.\nThe tree is 12 feet now, and it grows 1.5 feet each year. I will make a chart to help keep track.\nI add the height and I get:\nIf you do not have a table, you can also do 12 + 1.5 = 13.5. Then, 13.5 + 1.5 = 15, and so on.\nSo, it will take the tree X years to grow 24 feet (36 - 12) because the tree is already 12 feet tall.\nX years * 1.5 feet/year = 24 feet\nX = 24/1.5 = 16\nIt will take 16 years. The answer is 16 years.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 16 years. I hope it is correct.
