Then $f(9)=20$. But $9=2j$ implies $j = 5$ which is not a positive integer. Thus, $f(3) \\neq 2$.\nSuppose $f(3)=4$. Then $f(9)=2j=2\\cdot 5=10$.\n### Diagram:\nFinal Answer: Suppose $f(3)=4$. Then $f(9)=2j=2\\cdot 5=10$. It follows that $f(10)=f(9)=f^{-1}(f(f(9)))=f^{-1}(f(f(9)))=20$, which is not integers. Then $f(3)=6$. Then $f(9)=2j=2\\cdot 3=6$. It follows that $f(7)=f(9)=f^{-1}(f(f(9)))=f^{-1}(f(f(9)))=20$. We get the equation $f^{-1}(x)=x$. Thus, $f(x)=f^{-1}(x)$. Hence, $f(20)=20$.\nThus, $f(9)=6 \\implies f(6)=f(9)=20$. Then $f(f(9)) = f(6)=\\boxed{20}$.\nFinal Answer: The final",
