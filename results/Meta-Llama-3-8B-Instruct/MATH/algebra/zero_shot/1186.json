This means, we first need to find the $x$-coordinates of the midpoints, then add them, and then square the sum.\n### Let's do this step by step.\n1. The $x$-coordinates of the vertices are $x_1, x_2,$ and $x_3$.  The sum of their $x$-coordinates is given by $\\sqrt{13}$.\n2.

        " \nLet the three vertices of the triangle be $(m,n), (k,0), (p,0)$.  Then we know that $m + k + p = \\sqrt{13}$.\n### Step 1:\nLet $M$ be the midpoint of segment $(k, 0) - (m, n)$.  Then $M$ has coordinates $(\\frac{m+k}{2},\\frac{n}{2})$.  Let $m_1$ be its $x$-coordinate, so that $m_1 = \\frac{m+k}{2}$.  Let $n_1$ be its $y$-coordinate, so that $n_1 = \\frac{n}{2}$.\n### Step 2:\nLet $N$ be the midpoint of segment $(p, 0) - (m, n)$.  Then $N$ has coordinates $(\\frac{p+m}{2},\\frac{n}{2})$.  Let $m_2$ be its $x$-coordinate, so that $m_2 = \\frac{p+m}{2}$.  Let $n_2$ be its $y$-coordinate, so that $n_2 = \\frac{n}{2}$.\n### Step 3:\nLet $H$ be the midpoint of segment $(k, 0) - (p, 0)$.  Then $H$ has coordinates $(\\frac{k+p}{2},0)$.  Let $m_3$ be its $x$-coordinate, so that $m_3 = \\frac{k+p}{2}$.  Let $n_3 = 0$ be its $y$-coordinate.\n### Step 4:\nWe will compute $S^2$ as a sum of squares.  First, we can compute the sum of squares of the $x$-coordinates of the midpoints: $$(m_1)^2 + (m_2)^2 + (m_3)^2 = (\\frac{m+k}{2})^2 + (\\frac{p+m}{2})^2 + (\\frac{k+p}{2})^2$$ We can rewrite the above using the summation property of squares in the middle: \\begin{align*}\n(\\frac{m+k}{2})^2 + (\\frac{p+m}{2})^2 + (\\frac{k+p}{2})^2 & = \\frac{(m^2",
        " Step 1\nThe sum of the $x$-coordinates of the vertices of a triangle is $\\sqrt{13}$, so if we let $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$ and $(x_3, y_3)$ be the coordinates of the vertices of the triangles, we have $$x_1+x_2+x_3=\\sqrt{13}.$$The midpoint of the line segment from $(x_1, y_1)$ to $(x_2, y_2)$ is $\\big(\\frac{x_1+x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1+y_2}{2}\\big)$.  Let\u2019s call these coordinates $(m_1, m_2)$.  Therefore, we also have \\begin{align*}\nm_1&=\\frac{x_1+x_2}{2},\\\\\nm_2&=\\frac{y_1+y_2}{2}.\n\\end{align*}Step 2\nFrom Step 1, the sum of the $x$-coordinates of the midpoints $(m_1, m_2)$ and $(x_3, y_3)$ is $$m_1+x_3.$$Substituting for $m_1$, we get $$\\frac{x_1+x_2}{2}+x_3.$$Step 3\nCalculate the sum $m_1+x_2$.  We have $$m_1+x_2=\\frac{x_1+x_2}{2}+x_2=\\frac{x_1+2x_2+x_3}{2}.$$Step 4\nAdd $m_1+x_3$ and $m_1+x_2$.  We have $$m_1+x_2+m_1+x_3=\\frac{x_1+2x_2+x_3}{2}+\\frac{x_1+x_2+x_3}{2}=\\frac{x_1+3x_2+2x_3}{2}=\\frac{\\sqrt{13}+3x_2}{2}.$$Step 5\nSince this is equal to $S$, we have $$S=\\frac{\\sqrt{13}+3x_2}{2}.$$Therefore, $S^2$ is \n$$S^2=\\big(\\frac{\\sqrt{13}+3x_2}{2}\\big)^2=\\",

The midpoints of the sides are $(\\frac{a+c}{2},0)$, $(\\frac{a}{2},\\frac{b}{2})$ and $(\\frac{a+b}{2},0)$.

        " \nLet $(x_1,y_1)$, $(x_2,y_2)$, and $(x_3,y_3)$ denote the three vertices of the triangle, and $M_1$, $M_2$, and $M_3$ their midpoints. We have that $$x_1+x_2+x_3=\\sqrt{13}.$$ Furthermore, we have that \\begin{align*}S &= x_{M_1}+x_{M_2}+x_{M_3}\\\\ &= \\frac{x_1+x_2}{2} + \\frac{x_2+x_3}{2} + \\frac{x_3+x_1}{2}\\\\ &= x_1+x_2+x_3\\\\ &= \\sqrt{13}.\\end{align*}We have that $S^2=(\\sqrt{13})^2=\\boxed{13}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 13.
