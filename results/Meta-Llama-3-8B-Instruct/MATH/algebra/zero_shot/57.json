        " We first note that $x(x+5)=-n$ can have no real solution only when the value of $n$ is such that the function $f(x) = x(x+5)+n$ has no real zeros. We first expand $f(x)$ to get $f(x)=x^2+5x+n$. We now note that the discriminant of a quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c$ is given by $b^2-4ac$. Therefore, the discriminant of $x^2+5x+n$ is $25-4n$. We know that the quadratic equation has no real solutions when the discriminant is negative. Therefore, $25-4n<0 \\Rightarrow 25 < 4n \\Rightarrow 6.25 < n$. Therefore, when $n>6.25$, $x(x+5)+n$ has no real zeros. Also, when $n<6.25$ or equivalently $n<7$, the function $f(x)=x^2+5x+n$ has real zeros. We can model $n$ to be a continuous variable and sketch this function. We get the graph with the zeros represented by dashed lines. It can be noticed that the function $x^2+5x+n$ can have at most two zeros because there is no term with $x^3$ and $x^2$. Since $f(x)=x^2+5x+n$, we know that $n$ can take values up to 6.25. Now, we note that the question talks about probability which is not up to this level of complexity. We are asked to assume that $n$ is discrete integer taking values from 1 to 10 but is not given. Then we should take the average value in this domain (1 to 10) to be $n=5.5$ (not to be confused with the value 6.25 that we calculated earlier). Of course, there is no way that we can exactly solve this problem by this method. However, it gives a good approximation. I am also assuming that the solution should be scaled down from its given value 5.5. Therefore, I will proceed with scaling and return the final answer.\n### Answer: The problem as written is open to interpretation.

To solve these equations, we rely on the quadratic formula, which is given by $\\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 \u2013 4ac}}{2a}$ where $a$ is the coefficient of the square term, $b$ is the coefficient of the linear term, and $c$ is the constant term. We don\u2019t solve the quadratic equation every day, but at some point, understanding quadratic equations is crucial.  Quadratic equations have great importance in many areas, such as algebra, geometry, physics, engineering, economics and many others. They provide a way to model a wide variety of phenomena and have many real-world applications. From throwing a ball to understanding the orbits of planets, quadratic equations play a significant role in understanding many natural and artificial phenomena.

(To check this, complete the square: $x^2 + 5x + n = \\left(x + \\frac{5}{2}\\right)^2 + n - \\frac{25}{4}$. To get real solutions, the quadratic must be zero, so $n - \\frac{25}{4} \\ge 0 \\Rightarrow n \\ge \\frac{25}{4}$, but we also know that $n \\le 10$.)

        "  Condition: $n$ is a non-negative integer\nWhen $n=0,$ we have $x(x+5)=0,$ which has solution $x=0.$\nWhen $n>0$ and $n\\le 25,$ we have $x(x+5)=-n \\ge -25,$ so $x(x+5) \\ge -25.$ If $n=26,$ then $x(x+5) \\le 0.$ For all other $n>25,$ the equation $x(x+5)=-n$ has no real solutions.  Since the probability is now $\\frac{26}{10}=\\frac{13}{5},$ the answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{5}}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\frac{3}{5}. I hope it is correct. Note that for any $n \\in \\{1, 2, \\cdots, 25\\},$ $x(x+5)= -n$ has two real solutions. When $n=26,$ it does not have a real solution. Since the total number of outcomes is $10$ and $7$ of the outcomes are favorable, the probability that the $n$ we chose does not have a real solution is $\\frac{7}{10} = \\boxed{\\frac{7}{10}}.$ Final Answer: The final answer is \\frac{7}{10}. I hope it is correct. We can observe that this equation has solution when $n \\le 25.$ We can factor the equation and solve it. The condition $n$ should be a non-negative integer. Thus, the probability that there is no solution is $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{10} = \\frac{1}{2}}.$\n$$x(x+5) = -n$$\n$$x^2 + 5x + n = 0$$\nSo, we have to check when this quadratic equation has a solution. By using the discriminant criteria, the quadratic equation has two real solution if and only if the discriminant is greater than zero. We have $$D = 25 + 4n > 0$$\n$$25 + 4n > 0$$\n$$n > - \\frac{25}{4}$$ $$\\therefore n \\le 25$$ When the equation $x^2 + 5x + n = 0$ does not have any real solution it means that there are no $",
        " \n(I assume that we are considering $n$ to be positive here)\nFor the equation $x(x+5)=n$, where $n$ is positive, the equation will have no real solutions if $n>\\frac{25}{4}.$\n### Observations:\n- In the given equation $x(x+5) = -n$, is the value has to be negative so $n$ should be positive.\n- If we add $n$ to both sides, then $x(x+5) = -n \\iff x^2 + 5x + n = 0$ (quadratic equation).\n- Now here is the important point, if the value of $n> \\frac{25}{4}$, then the discriminant $(5)^2-4(1)(n) < 0$ (or $(5)^2-4(1)(n) < 16$), then the equation $x^2+5x+n=0$ is not having any real solutions.\n### Probability:\nNow the probability, let $k$ the number of possible values of $n$.
