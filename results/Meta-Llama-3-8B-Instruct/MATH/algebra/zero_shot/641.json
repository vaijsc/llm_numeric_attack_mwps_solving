I hope it is correct. iveau of $r$ on the hub will affect the readings.  That's not the case if you work on a consistent range of $t$ values for both $r$ values.\nTo avoid this, you can't find $r$ in the denominator.  Instead, you can use implicit differentiation: solve $\\frac{dy}{dx}=0$ at some $x$ value, and then solve $\\frac{dy}{dx}=0$ at that $x$ value and some other $t$ value.  The resulting equations will give you $r$ values that don't have $x$ in the denominator, and you can solve them without $x$ (after substituting the $x$-value first).\n### 3.

Bring on the algebra and derivatives. Solve the following equation for $x$:\n$$3x^2-18x-12=0$$ I will analyze it in the form of $ax^2+bx+c=0$, where $a=3, b=-18, c=-12$.\nWhen you solve this problem, you can simple avoid quadratic formula by factoring it out given that it\u2019s easy to factor. Substituting $a$ by $3$, $b$ by $-18$, and $c$ by $-12$ and I found that in general, $x$ is called the solution of the equation. In standard form, the equation becomes $3(x+2)(x-2)=0$.
