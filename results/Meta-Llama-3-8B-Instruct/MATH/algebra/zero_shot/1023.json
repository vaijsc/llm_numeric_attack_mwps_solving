        " To find the distance, we first have to find the vertex of the graph. The vertex is the (x,y) where the parabola is a minimum. To find this we use the formula $x_v = -b/2a$. In this case $a = 1, b = -8$, so the minimum occurs at $x_v = -(-8)/2 = 4$. The corresponding $y$ value is $y_v = (4)^2 - 8*4 + 15 = 15 - 32 + 15 = -2$.\nNow we can use the formula for distance, $d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$ with $(x_1, y_1) = (4, -2)$ and $(x_2, y_2) = (0, 2)$.\nWe square each term and add them: $d^2 = (x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 = (0 - 4)^2 + (2 - (-2))^2 = 16 + 16 = 32$.

        " The distance between $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is $\\sqrt{(x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2}.$ Since $(0, 2)$ is the given point, we can think that $(x_1, y_1) = (x, f(x))$ where $(x, f(x))$ is the vertex of the graph $y=f(x).$ Therefore, $x_1 = x$ and $y_1 = f(x) = x^2 - 8x + 15.$\n### The vertex of this parabola is a point where $y$ increases the least, which occurs when $f'(x) = 0.$ The derivative of a function is the rate of change of the function, so the point where $f'(x) = 0$ has a rate of change of $0.$ By the quotient rule, $f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(x^2 - 8x + 15\\right) = 2x - 8.$ The only value of $x$ for which this is $0$ is $x=\\boxed{4}.$\n### Thus, $(x_1, y_1) = (4, 3)$ is the vertex of the parabola, so the distance between it and $(0, 2)$ is $\\sqrt{(4 - 0)^2 + (3 - 2)^2} = \\boxed{5}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 5.

By comparing $f(x) = x^2 - 8x + 15$ with the general equation $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$, we see that $a=1$, $b=-8$, and $c=15$.

        " The vertex of the graph of the equation $f(x) = x^2 - 8x + 15$ is the value of $x$ that minimizes or maximizes the function.

Vertex of the graph of the equation will occur at x-coordinate at which f'(x)=0. So, f'(x)=2x-8. This implies that x=4. Therefore, the important values are (-\u221e, 4), (4, 3) and (\u221e, \u221e). So either vertex A (4, 3) or (4, -1) is the vertex. We are not interested in the \u201cdistance from the vertex to the y-axis\u201d. We want the distance \u201cbetween the vertex and the point (0, 2)\u201d. So we need the side of right triangle against the leg between the vertex (4, 3) and the point (0, 2). Distance between these points can be calculated using distance formula: \u221a((4-0)^2 + (3-2)^2) = \u221a(16 + 1) = \u221a17. Squaring ends here. Distance Formula arises when we get the square (we are talking about right angle). Since (4, 3) is the vertex, f(x) implies f(4)=3 hence y-coordinate will be 3 in (4, 3) is 3. Not -1.

        " We need to find the vertex of the graph of the equation $f(x) = x^2 - 8x + 15$. To do this, we first find the $x$-coordinate of the vertex. The equation $f(x) = x^2 - 8x + 15$ can be written equivalently as $f(x-(-\\frac{b}{a})) = a(x+(-\\frac{b}{a}))^2 + c$ where $a$ is the coefficient of $x^2$ and $b$ is the coefficient of $x$. Therefore, we can compare these two equations. We obtain $\\frac{-b}{a} = \\frac{-8}{1}$ which implies the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $(-\\frac{-8}{1}) = 8$.\n### Step 1:  find the $x$-coordinate of the vertex\nNext we will find the $y$-coordinate of the vertex. Let the $x$-coordinate of the vertex be $x_v$. Then $f(x_v) = x_v^2 - 8x_v + 15$. Since $(x_v, f(x_v))$ is the vertex, we substitute $x_v$ for $x$ in $f(x)$. Then we have\n$$f(x_v) = x_v^2 - 8x_v + 15$$ \nso that the $y$-coordinate of the vertex is $y_v = x_v^2 - 8x_v + 15$. Hence the vertex $(8, y_v)$.\n### Step 2:  find the  $y$-coordinate of the vertex\nNow we are asked to find the distance between the vertex of the graph of the equation $f(x) = x^2 - 8x + 15$ and the point $(0, 2)$. The formula for the distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is $\\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$. Since the vertex is $(8, y_v)$, and the point is $(0, 2)$, we can evaluate the distance by substituting these into the formula.\n$$\\sqrt{(0 - 8)^2 + (2 - y_v)^2}$$\n### Step 3:  find the distance",
        " First, we find where the vertex of the graph of the given function lies. For a parabola with equation $y = ax^2 + bx + c$, the vertex occurs at $(x, y) = (-b/2a, f(-b/2a))$. Given our function $f(x) = x^2 - 8x + 15$, we can find the $x$-coordinate of the vertex. $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $x=-b/2a$. In our case $a=1$ and $b=-8$. So $x = -(-8)/2(1) = 4$. To find $y$, we simply have to substitute $4$ into the equation $f(x)$. So $$f(4)=(4)^2-8(4)+15=16-32+15=-1.$$ Now, we know that the vertex is at $(4, -1)$.\n### ",
        " Let\u2019s first calculate the vertex of the graph of the equation. The $x^2$ term is being squared, so we know it\u2019s a quadratic equation. You can use the vertex formula to figure it out: $$x = -b/2a,$$ where $a = 1$ and $b = -8$. So, the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $8/2 = 4$. To figure out the $y$-coordinate, we simply substitute $x = 4$ into the equation $f(x) = x^2 - 8x + 15$. So we get $f(4) = 4^2 - 8(4) + 15 = 16 - 32 + 15 = -1$. Now, we have the vertex: $(4, -1)$. The problem is asking for distance, and it\u2019s telling you to use the point $(0, 2)$. The formula for the distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is $\\sqrt{(x_1-x_2)^2 + (y_1-y_2)^2}$. In this case, you have $(x_1, y_1) = (4, -1)$ and $(x_2, y_2) = (0, 2)$. Substitute these into the distance formula and you get $\\sqrt{(4-0)^2 + (-1-2)^2} = \\sqrt{(4)^2 + (-3)^2} = \\sqrt{25} = \\boxed{5}$. So, the distance is $5$ units.\nAs I move through my explanation, I also provide a brief summary of the key steps involved in finding the distance between the vertex of the graph of the equation $f(x) = x^2 - 8x + 15$ and the point $(0, 2)$:\n1.

Calculate the distance between the vertex $(4,-",
        " \nThe vertex of the graph of the function $f$ is the point at which $f$ achieves its lowest value, if it opens upwards, or its greatest value, if it opens downwards. It is halfway between the $x$-intercepts.  We've been told a way to find the $x$-intercepts, but there's a quicker way to find them for this quadratic.  We will use the quadratic formula to find them as roots.  That is,\n$$x=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}=\\frac{-(-8)\\pm\\sqrt{(-8)^2-4(1)(15)}}{2(1)}=4\\pm\\sqrt{4-15}.$$Both $x$-intercepts of the graph of the function $f$ are 2. The vertex is hence halfway between these two, so it has an $x$-coordinate of $\\frac{2+2}{2}=\\boxed{2}$. It is above the $x$-axis for one factor of $(x-2)$, and below it for the other.  Since $f(2)=-(2-2)^2=0$, these two factors cannot cancel each other out.\nThe final expression for the point at which the distance is to be found is that of the vertex, which is at $(2, 2-8+15)= \\boxed{(2, 9)}$.\nNow, we have the equation for the distance: $$d = \\sqrt{(2-0)^2 + (9-2)^2} = \\sqrt{4+7^2} = \\sqrt{49} = \\boxed{7}.$$The distance between the vertex and $(0,2)$ is 7. We have proven that it will be the same regardless of whether the absolute value is used.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 7. I hope it is correct.  If you want to solve this problem using the formula for the vertex of a parabola with its axis of symmetry, we can explain if you want.  Your answer does not show this link, so this extra information is only useful for us.  Final Answer: The final answer is 7. I hope it is correct.
