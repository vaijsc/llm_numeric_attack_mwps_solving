B Message Grid now renders in Overlay straight awayouble/triple-checked, this is the correct solution. Moral of the story: Pay attention to constant terms (especially in multiplication). 1. If $a$ and $b$ are solutions to the quadratic equation $x^2+ax+b=0$, then they must satisfy $a^2+aa+b=b$, so $a(a+b)=b$, or $a=b/\\left(1-a\\right)$.  We can also note that $0=a^2+aa+b=\\left(a+b\\right)^2-2ab$. Therefore, $a+b=\\sqrt{2ab}$, which we can simplify to $a+b=\\sqrt{b}\\sqrt{b}=b$ by recalling that $a=\\frac{b}{1-a}=b\\left(1+\\frac{1}{a}\\right)^{-1}=b\\left(1-\\frac{1}{a}+O\\left(\\frac{1}{a^2}\\right)\\right)=b\\left(1-\\frac{1}{a}+O\\left(\\frac{1}{a}\\right)\\right)=b-b+O\\left(\\frac{1}{a}\\right)$, in the case where $a\\to1$. So, in the case where $a+b=b$, we have $a+b=b$; therefore, $a=0$ or $a=",
        " To solve the given equation, we use the quadratic formula and find all values of $x$ equal to zero. $$x=\\frac{-a\\pm \\sqrt{a^2-4b}}{2}$$ We are given two points $a$ and $b$ such that they both satisfy the given equation. This means that for each point we have$$a=\\frac{-a\\pm \\sqrt{a^2-4b}}{2}$$ $$b=\\frac{-a\\pm \\sqrt{a^2-4b}}{2}$$ We need to find the pair $(a,b)$ that satisfies these equations.\nSince $a$ is a solution, we can replace $x$ with $a$ in the original equation and find $$a^2+aa+b=0.$$ Thus, $aa+a+b=0$, which implies that $(a+1)b=-a^2$, or $ab=-a^2-(a+1)b$. That is, $ab=-a^2-(a+1)b$.\nSince $b$ is also a solution, we can replace $x$ with $b$ in the original equation and find $$b^2+ab+b=0.$$ Hence, $b^2+ab+b=0$, which is the same as $b(ab)+b^2+b=0$. That is, $b^2+ab+b=0$.\n### Plugging in b into the above equation, we have a^2+a+b=0. We then subtract b from both sides and we get (a^2+a)+(b-a)=0. Hence, a^2+a=b-a. After dividing both sides by a, we get a+b-1=0, or b=a-1.\nSo we have $a$ and $b$ such that $a=\\frac{-a\\pm \\sqrt{a^2-4b}}{2}$ and $$b=a-1$$ $$b=\\frac{-a\\pm \\sqrt{a^2-4(a-1)}}{2}$$ Since $a$ and $b$ are real and nonzero, we know $\\sqrt{a^2-4b}$ is real. (Complex numbers cannot be real at the same time.) And so, we have two equations and two unknowns for $a$ and $b$ \\begin{align*} a &= \\frac{-a + \\sqrt{a^2-4(a-",
        " \nFirst, we notice that the solutions of a quadratic equation are\n$$x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$ for some $c$.\nSo, we have\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{-b\\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ab}}{2a} = a,b \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\quad (2a)^2b^2 &= 4a^2b \\pm 4a^2bab \\\\\n&\\Rightarrow \\quad 4a^2b^2 = 4a^2b(a+b) \\\\\n&\\Rightarrow \\quad -ab = 0 \\\\\n&\\Rightarrow \\quad ab = 0\n\\end{align*} \nSo, $a=0$ or $b=0$. \nCase 1: $a=0$. Then the equation becomes $x^2+b=0$, which means $b=0$ or $a=b$. If $a=b=0$, then $x^2=0$, which has two solutions, $x=0$. So, we have either the pair $(0,0)$, or the pair $(a,a)$ for some $a$.\nCase 2: $b=0$. Then the equation becomes $x^2+ax=0$, which means $a=0$. So, the pair is $(a,b) = (0,0)$.\nNow, let's see the original problem, where we are given that $a$ and $b$ are nonzero real numbers. So, $a \\ne 0$, and $b \\ne 0$. Then, we have in Case 1, if either $a=0$ or $b=0$, we contradict the fact that they are both nonzero. So, we must have $ab \\ne 0$.\nSo, since $ab \\ne 0$, we must have both $a$ and $b$ are nonzero. But then, we can just write $a = x_1$ and $b = x_2$, where the original equation becomes\n$$(x-x_1)(x-x_2) = x^2 - (x_1+x_2)x + x_1x_2$$ \nComparing this with our original equation $x^2 + ax + b = 0$, we can see that\n$$a = -(x_1+x_",
        "The solutions of the equation $${x^2 + ax + b = 0}$$ are $x=a$ and $x=b$. This means that when we substitute $x=a$ into the equation, we get $$a^2 + a^2 + b = 0 \\Rightarrow 2a^2+b=0.$$When we substitute $x=b$ into the equation, we get $$b^2 + ab + b = 0 \\Rightarrow b^2 + ab + b=0.$$Now, we can isolate $b$ from the second equation, which gives $$b = -1/a.$$  Then, substituting $b$ back into the first equation, we obtain\n\\begin{align*}\n2a^2-\\frac{1}{a} &=0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\quad a^3+2a &=1\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\quad (a+2/3)(a^2-2a/3+1)&=0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\quad a=-2/3 \\text{ or }a &=1\n\\end{align*}Both nonzero values of $a$ give $b=1$ or $b=-2/3$, but $b=-2/3$ is not a solution to the original equation.

        " \nStart with the quadratic formula: $x = \\frac{-a \\pm \\sqrt{a^2 - 4b}}{2}$. We know that $x=a$ and $x=b$ are solutions to the equation, so we can set them equal to the quadratic formula: $a = \\frac{-a \\pm \\sqrt{a^2 - 4b}}{2}$ and $b = \\frac{-a \\pm \\sqrt{a^2 - 4b}}{2}$. This will give us two equations, $a = \\frac{-a + \\sqrt{a^2 - 4b}}{2}$ and $b = \\frac{-a + \\sqrt{a^2 - 4b}}{2}$. Since the numerator of the right side is $-a + \\sqrt{a^2 - 4b}$, both equations will have to have the same value for $a$ (i.e. $a = \\frac{-a + \\sqrt{a^2 - 4b}}{2} = b$). In order for that to be true, $a$ must equal $-b$ and the square root must equal $0$. However, in order for the square root to equal $0$, $a^2 - 4b$ must equal $0$. But $a^2 - 4b = a^2 - 4a$ since $a = -b$, so $4a = a^2$. Factoring the quadratic $a^2 - 4a$ gives us $(a - 4)(a + 1)$. Since the terms have to equal $0$ individually, we have $a = 4$ and $a = -1$. Therefore, the possible values for $(a,b)$ are $(4,-4)$ and $(-1,1)$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $(4,-4)$ and $(-1,1)$. I hope it is correct.

        " We know that we have $x^2+ax+b=0$, with solutions $x=a$ and $x=b$.  Plugging in $x=a$ and $x=b$, we obtain two equations:\n\\begin{align*}\na^2 + a^2 + ab &=0,\\\\\nb^2+ab+b &=0.\n\\end{align*}We can add these equations to obtain\n$$a^2+b^2+2ab=0.$$Rearranging, we get that $a^2+b^2=-2ab$, which means $(a-b)^2=0$.\nTherefore, $a=b$, so $b=a$. Given this, the first equation simplifies to\n$$a^2+a^2+a^2 =0\\Rightarrow3a^2=0\\Rightarrow a=0,$$which is impossible if we are told $a$ is nonzero.  Therefore, we must have reached a contradiction. Hence, the statement is false.\\\\(a,b)=(0,0)$is a non-zero pair that satisfies the condition. I know I made a mistake somewhere.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is (0,0). I hope it is correct.  Please let me know if it is wrong. I will give feedback for those if say so.",
        " (a,b)\nIf the equation ${x^2 + ax + b = 0}$ has solutions $a$ and $b$, then the factors must be\n$$(x-a)(x-b) = x^2 - (a+b)x + ab.$$Therefore, $-a-b = a$ and $ab = b$, so $b = 0$. But the original equation wasn\u2019t supposed to have solution 0, so this is a contradiction. If instead $b = 1$ then $a + b = a$ and $ab = b$, so $a = 1$. And accordingly, $a = 1$ and $b = 1$.

        " We have $x-a$ and $x-b$ as the factors of our quadratic equation. Thus, our equation is written as\n$$x^2 + ax + b = (x-a)(x-b) = x^2-(a+b)+ab,$$so $a+b=a$ and $ab=b$. Solving this system of equations for $a$ and $b$ gives $\\boxed{(1,1)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is (1,1). I hope it is correct. Thank you.

Best regards,  Dinesh  I think this should be the correct solution.  We are given that  \\begin{align*}  x^2+ax+b&=0 \\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad x^2+(a)x+(b) &=0\\\\  \\end{align*}  has solutions a and b.  Therefore, we have  x-a \\text{ and } x-b \\text{ as factors}  of our quadratic.  Thus, our quadratic can be written as  \\begin{align*}   x^2+ax+b&=0\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad (x-a)(x-b)&=0 \\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad x^2-(a+b)+ab&=0.  \\end{align*}  Comparing to the left-hand side of our original equation, we get that a+b=a and ab=b.  Solving the system \\begin{align*} a+b&=a\\\\ ab&=b, \\end{align*} we obtain a=1 and b=1.  Therefore, we have \\boxed{(1,1) as our solution}.  I hope this is correct.  Please",
        " Let $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ be the solution. Then $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are the roots of the equation $x^2+ax+b=0$.

        " \nThe given information tells us that the equation $${x^2 + ax + b = 0}$$ has solutions $a$ and $b$. This means that $x^2+ax+b$ is equal to $0$ when $x=a$ and when $x=b$. Plugging in both $x=a$ and $x=b$, we get \\begin{align*}\na^2 + a\\cdot a + b &= 0,\\\\\nb^2 + ab + b &= 0.\n\\end{align*}\nRearranging and combining terms, we see that both $a^2+b$ and $b^2+a$ are equal to $0$. Adding the two equations together yields $$(a^2+b)+(b^2+a)=0,$$ which simplifies to $$(a+b)^2=0,$$ which implies that $a+b=0$. So, $a$ and $b$ are opposites.  Now, plugging $b=-a$ back into either of the equations above, we can solve for $a^2$:\n$$a^2+a(-a) + (-a) = 0,$$\nwhich simplifies to\n$$a^2 - a^2 = 0\\Rightarrow \\boxed{(a, b) = (-1, 1).}$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is (-1,1).
