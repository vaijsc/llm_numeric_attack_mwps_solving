I have to acknowledge that I did not understand the definition of & until the end when I realized it was equivalent to a type of arithmetic operation. Even then, the problem was a bit challenging for me because I had to handle fractions and radicals carefully.  I must say that I learned a lot from this experience. Thank you for sharing this problem.\n2020-11-17 16:56:54 Sandy 3 (0) 16582\nComment: Yes, it's an unusual problem, but it's a good challenge to practice our skills in handling fractions and radicals. It's great to see you acknowledged that it was a bit challenging for you, but you were able to learn from the experience.\nHowever, I must point out that when you wrote the solution, you didn't explain the steps at the beginning, which made the solution a bit hard to follow. In the next time, it would be better if you could include the detailed steps to solve the problem, like writing $\\sqrt{a b - a} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\sqrt{a}\\right)^2 - a} = \\sqrt{a - a} = 0$ and so $a \\& b = \\frac{\\sqrt{a b + a}}{\\sqrt{a b - b}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{a b + a}}{0} = \\infty$. I hope you can keep it in mind and improve your explanation in the future.\n2020-11-17 17:10:15 viscagua742 23 (0) 16583\nComment: I understand your point, and I apologize for the lack of detailed steps.

Simplify radical expressions when possible.\n2. Pay attention to the radicals inside and outside the radicals when simplifying the expression.\n3. Before simplifying, ensure that you have simplified the expression, so you can simplify better.\n4. Always check your work by simplifying the expression and comparing the obtained expression to your simplified expression.  If they are  not equal, that  means there is  something you missed,  and  you need to double-check. It is important to double-check your work before presenting it to others.\n5.

        " \nWe can compute as follows:\\begin{align*}\n9 \\& 2&=\\frac{\\sqrt{18+9}}{\\sqrt{18-2}}\\\\\n&=\\frac{\\sqrt{27}}{\\sqrt{16}}\\\\\n&=\\frac{\\sqrt{9\\cdot 3}}{4}\\\\\n&=\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{4}\n\\end{align*}The answer is $9\\&2=\\boxed{\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{4}}$. Note that if we were asked to simplify this further, we could pull a factor of $\\sqrt{3}$ out of the radical to get $\\boxed{\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{4}}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{4}. I hope it is correct.  IMHO, I can solve this problem in different ways for example:\nFirst, we have: $$9\\&2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{18+9}}{\\sqrt{18-2}}.$$ Simplifying the expression, we have $$9\\&2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{27}}{\\sqrt{16}}.$$ Since 27=3^3 and 16=2^4, we can factor these out in the radical as follows: $$9\\&2 = \\frac{3^{\\frac32}}{2^2}.$$ Multiplying the denominator with 1 in the form of \\frac{3}{3}, we have $$9\\&2 = \\frac{3^{\\frac32}}{\\frac{6}{3}2}.$$ We can simplify 3, so we have $$9\\&2 = \\frac{3^{\\frac32}}{\\frac{12}{3}}.$$ Canceling 3 that appears in both the numerator and the denominator, we have $$9\\&2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}.$$ Since we have \\sqrt{3} in the numerator, we can pull that out and simplify the fraction as follows: $$9\\&2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}.$$ Simplifying this further by pulling out a factor of 3, we have $$9\\&2 = \\boxed{\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{4}}.$$ Therefore, the answer is 9\\&2 = \\boxed{\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{4}}.\nFinal Answer: The final",
