        " Let\u2019s solve it step by step.\n1. We are given $f(x) = 5x-12$. So $f^{-1}(x)$ is the inverse function of $f(x)$.\nTo find $f^{-1}(x)$ we rearrange $f(x)=5x-12$ to get $f(x)+12=5x$ which gives us $f(x)=5x-12$.

Since the function inverse is defined only in the domain of the original function on its range, let\u2019s think in terms of the function.\nFrom the graph below, we see that the range of $f(x)$ is $(-12,\\infty)$.

As we proceed we can observe that as $x+1$ increases so will $f(x+1)$ until we can finally only have increasing values as both $x$ and $x+1$ also increase.\nThis tells us that we can only increase $f^{-1}$ and therefore we can only increase $x$ until you reach $\\boxed{f(x)=3}$ but $",

        " Give [Hint](link) $$[Solution]$$For this type of problems, we need to use the definition of an inverse function. The inverse function of $f(x)$ is the function that satisfies $f(f^{-1}(x))=x$. That is, if we replace $f(x)$ with $y$, then find the value of $x$ for which $y=f^{-1}(y)$. Here, $y=5x-12$ is the function $f(x)$. So we need to find a value of $x$ for which $x=f^{-1}(y)$. However, we are told that $x=f(x+1)$. We can put this into the previous equation. Let $t=x+1$, we have $y=f(t)$, i.e., $y=5t-12$. So we need to find $t$ for which $t=f^{-1}(5t-12)$. Now rewrite $y=f(x)$ using $y=5t-12$, we have $5x-12=y$, so $x=\\frac{y+12}{5}$. Set $y=5t-12$, we have $x=\\frac{(5t-12)+12}{5}=\\frac{5t}{5}=t$. So $t=f^{-1}(5t-12)$. We have now to find the value of $t$ for which $x=t$. Now we have $x=t=f(x+1)$, so there is no need to find $x$ as we already have it. So the answer is $\\boxed{t=x=3}$. Indeed, $f(3)=5(3)-12=3$, so $f(3)=f(2)$. So the inverse function of $f(x)$ is $f^{-1}(x)=x+1$. Indeed, if we put $x=2$, we have $f(2)=f^{-1}(2)$, i.e., $f(2)=f(2)$. Also, if we put $x=3$, we have $f(3)=f^{-1}(3)$, i.e., $f(3)=f(3)$. So the inverse function of $f(x)$ is indeed $f^{-1}(x)=x+1$. Therefore, the answer is $x=3$.\n### Explanation: The value of $x$ for which $f^{-1}(x)=",

For determining the inverse of function, we set y = f(x) and then interchange x and y. For this problem, f(x) = 5x \u2212 12. Now set y = 5x \u2212 12. y = 5x \u2212 12 (1) . Interchange the x and y to get x = 5y \u2212 12. x = 5y \u2212 12 finally we get f^{\u22121}(x) = x/5+12/5. This function is f(\u22121). Using the given information f^{\u22121}(x) = f(x + 1), so set f(x + 1) = x/f^{\u22121}(x). So, we need to solve the equation. f(x + 1) = f^{\u22121}(x) and using f(x + 1) = 5(x + 1) \u2212 12 and f^{\u22121}(x) = x/5 + 12/5. f(x + 1) = 5(x + 1) \u2212 12 = 5x + 5 \u2212",
        " First, we need to find the inverse function $f^{-1}(x)$. To do so, we set the equation $y=5x-12$ so that $f(x)=5x-12$. Then, we interchange $x$ and $y$, which gives us $$x=5y-12.$$To simplify, we add 12 to both sides, yielding $$x+12=5y.$$Next, we divide both sides by 5, yielding $\\frac{x+12}{5}=y$. Finally, we solve for $x$ by subtracting 12 from both sides and then dividing by 5: $x+12$ becomes $x$, $\\frac{x+12}{5}$ becomes $x$, and after subtracting and dividing, we obtain $\\boxed{x=\\frac{x}{5}+2.4}$. We have found the inverse function.\n### ",
        " If $f(x)=5x-12$, then we can write $f^{-1}(x)$ as follows: $$x=\\frac{f^{-1}(x)+12}{5}\\Rightarrow\\qquad f^{-1}(x)=\\frac{5x-12}{1}=5x-12.$$Now we need to find $x$ such that $f^{-1}(x)=f(x+1)$. Plugging in what we know, we have \\begin{align*} 5x-12&=5(x+1)-12\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad5x-12&=5x+5-12\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad0&=5\\\\ \\end{align*} But $5\\neq0$, so this is not possible. Therefore, the given instruction is invalid and there is no value of x such that $f^{-1}(x)=f(x+1)$.
