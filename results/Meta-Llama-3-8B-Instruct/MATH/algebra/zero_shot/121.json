        " The equation of the center of the circle is $(0,-1)$, and the equation of the center of the circle is $(-3,2)$. The distance between these centers is the radius of the bigger circle.

Now let\u2019s use the equation $x^2+y^2+Dx+Ey+F$ to substitute points on the smaller circle. We know that $(-3,2)$ is a solution to this equation. We need to find $D, E, F$, which, then, allows us to calculate $D + E + F$. Our hope is that we can find a solution other than $(-3,2)$.\n#### Answer: The tangent circle is simpler. So let\u2019s see what we can do. $(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$, $(x-0)^2 + (y+1)^2 = (3\\sqrt{2})^2$, $x^2 + y^2 + 2y - 1 = 18$. Simplifying, we get $x^2 + (y-1)^2 = 19$. To get $x^2 + y^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0$, we get $x^2 + y^2 + 2(E) + Dx + F = 19$, which means $$ $$ $D + E + F = 0 - 2(E) + 19 = 19 - 2(E) and substituting the values from the question, we get D + E + F = 19 - 2(-7) = 19 + 14 = 33$.

We can plug-in $(x,y) = (0,-1)$ into the equation $x^2+y^2+Dx+Ey+F = 0$ and by subtracting the value 1 we get $F = -1$.\nSo now the equation becomes $x^2+y^2+Dx+Ey-1 = 0$. We can now substitute $(-3,2)$ for $(x,y)$ into this equation. $x^2+y^2+Dx+Ey-1=0 \\Leftrightarrow 9+4-9D+2E-1=0$.",
        " We may treat both circles as we would any other circle by using the equation $(x-a)^2+(y-b)^2=r^2$, where $a$ is the $x$-coordinate of the center of the circle, $b$ is the $y$-coordinate of the center of the circle and $r$ is the radius of the circle. For the small circle, $(x+3)^2+(y-2)^2=r^2$. For the large circle, $(x-0)^2+(y+1)^2=r^2$. Substituting the center and the radius of the small circle into the quadratic of the large circle (we are essentially seeing if they tangent effectively), $a=0, b=1, r^2=7.07^2=49.34$, $(x-0)^2+(y+1)^2=49.34$. Substituting into the quadratic of small circle, $(x+3)^2+(y-2)^2=(49.34-25)^2=24.34=9.49$. The equation becomes $x^2+y^2+6x-4y-109.12=0$. Hence $D=6$, $E=-4$ and $F=-109.12$.

We can come up with the solution by using similar triangles. First, we can find that the radius of the circle centered at $(-3,2)$ is $2.83$. We can use the distance formula to find that the radius of the circle centered at $(0,-1)$ is $7.07$. Then, using similar triangles, we can create a right triangle with hypotenuse $2.83$ and leg $6 - (-1) = 7$. We know the length of the other leg is $5$. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find that the value of the third leg, $1$, is $1$.\nNext, we can use the fact that $(1, 6)$ and $(-5, 4)$ are both on the circle with radius $2.83$ centered at $(-3, 2)$. We can use the distance formula to find the distance between $(1, 6)$ and $(-5, 4)$, which is $r$, then we can get that $r = 2.83$. Then we can use the fact that $r = 2.83$ to find the equation of the circle with radius $2.83$ centered at $(-3, 2)$. This gives us $x^2 + y^2 - 6 x + 4 y - 26 = 0$.\nFinally, we can add $x^2 + y^2 - 6 x + 4 y - 26 = 0$ and $x^2 + y^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0$ to find that $D = -6$ and $E = 4",
        "  Help us write the equation of the smaller circle. We have the center at $(-3,2)$ and since the circle is centered, the radius $r$ is given by $r=\\big[(3)^2 + (2-(-1))^2\\big]^{1/2}=\\sqrt{41}$. The general equation of the circle with center at $(x_0,y_0)$ and radius $r$ is $(x-x_0)^2 + (y-y_0)^2 = r^2$. Applying this for the smaller circle, we have $$(x-(-3))^2 + (y-2)^2 = (\\sqrt{41})^2,$$which we simplify to $$(x+3)^2 + (y-2)^2 = 41.$$The only thing we need to do now is to rewrite the equation in the standard form $x^2+y^2+dx+ey+f=0$, which is $(x^2 + 2x + 9)  + (y^2 - 4y) + 41 = 0$, so we can write \\begin{align*} x^2 + y^2 + 2x - 4y + 25 &= 0 \\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad x^2 + y^2 +2x-4y + 25 &=0. \\end{align*} The expression we need to find, $D+E+F$ equals $2-4+25= \\boxed{23}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 23.

Since the two circles are internally tangent, at the point of tangency they would be 5 units apart.\nLastly, let\u2019s solve for the distance between $(-3,2)$ and the point where the circles are tangent, which would be $(-2,5)$. This distance would also be 5.\nBy using the distance formula, we have $$\\sqrt{(-3-(-2))^2+(2-5)^2}=\\sqrt{1+9}=5$$\nNow, the final piece of information we need is the radius of the second circle.

Expanding this out and moving all the terms to the left side, we get $x^2 - 2x + y^2 + 2y + 1 - r^2 = 0$.\nNow let\u2019s move to the equation of the smaller circle. The coordinates of its center are $(-3,2)$, so its equation is $(x-(-3))^2 + (y-(2))^2 = r^2$. Expanding and moving everything to the left side, we obtain $x^2 + 6x + y^2 - 4y + 4 - r^2 = 0$.\nNow, since these two circles are internally tangent, we can substitute $(x,y)$ into both equations. They should be equal to each other. This means that for this $(x,y)$ we should get the same value of $x^2 + y^2 + Dx + Ey + F$. To find this $(x,y)$, let\u2019s set $x=1$ and $y=6$.\nThe point $(1,6)$ lies on the larger circle.

Let\u2019s call the radius of the circle centered at $(0,-1)$ $r$. Then, using the distance formula, $4.24=r+2.83$.

When we rearrange the equation and compare to the equation we are given (i.e., $x^2 + y^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0$), we see that $a^2+b^2-F=-1.41$ or $F= 3.85$. Since $a,b$ do not depend on $D,E$, we can plug them in.\n$D = -2$, $E = -4$.\nThus, $D+E+F= -2-4+3.85 = -2.15$.\nThe answer is $D+E+F = -2.15$.",

Completing the square gives $x^2 + y^2 + Dx + Ey + F = (x+\\frac{D}{2})^2 + (y + \\frac{E}{2})^2 -(\\frac{D}{2})^2 -(\\frac{E}{2})^2 +F.$Note that the distance between the centroids of the two circles is $(3,-3)$ so $-3 + 2 -1 = 3$, and $-3 + 0 -1 = -4$.

This implies that $F = -\\frac{D^2+E^2}{4} = - \\frac{36+64}{4} = - \\frac{100}{4} = -25$, which implies that $D+E+F = -6 -8 -25 = \\boxed{-39}$.[/asy] Final Answer: The final answer is -5. I hope it is correct. Quick and easy way to solve the problem is first to see that the center of the circle $(-3,2)$ is equal to the $y$-coordinate $-1$ plus the radius $sqrt{9 + 4} = 7.07$, so the radius is equal to $7 - 1 = 6$. Now to write the equation of the circle with $(x + 3) + y - 2 = 0$, it is what? Now we see that the radius is equal to $6$, so the equation of the circle is $(x + 3)^2 + (y - 2)^2 - 36 = 0$, which implies that $D + E + F = \\boxed{-5}$ Final Answer: The final answer is -5.

        " The key goal is to find the equation of the smaller circle. The key insight is that given the equations of the circles, we can find only the radius of the smaller circle, but not its equation itself. Therefore, we must find an alternative way to do this.\nOnce we know the radius of smaller circle, we can easily write the equation of the bigger circle, and so the answer will be D + E + F = (radius of the smaller circle)^2.\nFrom the diagram, the distance between the center of inscribed circle (1,6) and the center of the smaller circle is the same as the distance between the center of inscribed circle (1,6) and the center of the bigger circle.\nBy the distance formula, we can find the length of CD: $CD = \\sqrt{(1 \u2013 (-3))^2 + (6 \u2013 2)^2} = \\sqrt{16 + 16} = 4\\sqrt{2}.$\nNow, we consider the bigger circle. The center of the bigger circle is (0,-1), and its radius is the length of the line segment DM.\n$$DM = \\sqrt{(0 + 3)^2 + (-1 + 2)^2} = \\sqrt{3^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{10}.$$\nTherefore, by the Pythagorean theorem, the length of the line segment CM is $CM = \\sqrt{(CD)^2 \u2013 (DM)^2} = \\sqrt{(4\\sqrt{2})^2 \u2013 (sqrt{10})^2} = \\sqrt{16 \\cdot 2 - 10} = \\sqrt{30}.$\nSince this is the radius of the smaller circle, we have the answer: $D + E + F = (\\sqrt{30})^2 = \\boxed{30}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 30.

        "  We know the center of the smaller circle and the equations of the circles. To make the problem easy, we will use the standard equation of a circle $(x-h)^2+(y-k)^2=r^2$, where the radius is $r$.\n### Step 1: Write the standard equation of the standard circle.\nWrite the standard equation of the circle centered at $(-3,2)$ in standard form $(x-h)^2+(y-k)^2=r^2$, where the center is $(-3,2)$. We know the center, so we can plug these values into the formula: $$(x-(-3))^2+(y-2)^2=r^2$$ or in expanded form: $$x^2+9-x+4+y^2-4y+4=r^2$$\n### Step 2: Compare the coefficients in the result with those in the expanded form of $x^2+y^2+dx+ey+f=0$.\nNote that we have an $x^2$ and $y^2$, but we need only one in the equation $x^2+y^2+dx+ey+f=0$. We also have subtraction signs in front of the constants, so we need to subtract $9$, $-4$, and $4$ from both sides. Thus, we end up with the equation: $$x^2+dy+ey+f-9=0$$Then, we equate the coefficients of $x^2$ and the linear terms, which gives us $d=-1$ and $e=-4$. The constant term is now $F-r^2$, where $r$ is the radius. If we now compare the expressions for $F-r^2$ from the two equations, we get $F-r^2=-9$, the same as the constant term in $x^2+dy+ey+f=0$. Finally, we need to plug in the radius into the equation, to obtain the equation of the circle in the desired form, which is $$x^2-y^2-4x+2y+F-r^2=0$$\n### Step 3: Use the other equation to find the radius.\nThe last step is to use the other circle equation to find the radius. Note that this equation is $$(x-0)^2+(y+1)^2=7.07^2$$ where $7.07$ is the radius. We can rewrite this equation",

        " 1\nWe know that the center of the smaller circle is $(-3,2)$. We can apply the distance formula between the points $(-3,2)$ and $(0,-1)$, which is $\\sqrt{(0-(-3))^2 + (-1-2)^2}= \\sqrt{9+9} = 3\\sqrt{2}$. This means the center of the bigger circle is $(0,-1)$ at a distance of $7.07$ from the center of the smaller circle.\nNow we can find D and E. We can write that $(x+3)^2 + (y-2)^2 = (7.07)^2$. Using this formula we have $x^2 + 6x + 9 + y^2 - 4y + 4 = 49$. Rearranging this, we get $x^2 + y^2 + 6x - 4y + 44 = 0$. This has form that we want and D is 6, E is -4.
