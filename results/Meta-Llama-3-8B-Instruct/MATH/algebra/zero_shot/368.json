I hope it is correct. Explanation: We are told that $x + y = 153$, and $\\frac{x}{y} = 0.7$. So $x = 0.7y$. Then, $0.7y + y = 153$ implies $1.7y = 153$.

        " First, by definition of a fraction, we know $\\dfrac{x}{y} = 0.7 = \\dfrac{7}{10}$. If you multiply both sides by $y$, we can rearrange the equation: $10x = 7y$.  We are also given the sum of $x$ and $y$: $x + y = 153$.  To solve for $y - x$, we can subtract the first equation from the second equation: $y-x = 153 - (10x/7)$.  If we substitute $y = 10x/7$ from the first equation into the second equation, we obtain:  $y-x = 153 - (10x/7) - x = (153 - 10x/7 - x) = 153 - 17x/7 = 3(51-17x/7)$.  Since the answer should be an integer, we know that the value of 17x/7 must be 51.  There are many solutions for $x$, but one possible solution is $x = 14$, which then makes $y = 20$ (using $y = 10x/7$ from the first equation).  Then $y-x = 20-14 = 6$.\n### Description: Solution description\nLast updated:\u00a02022-08-19 15:59:38\n### Feedback Feedback\nAny feedback? \u00a0(Will be sent to our tutor support team to improve our e-learning platform.) \n meer laden statistics.fasta load from libraryinfo.Last updated:\u00a02022-08-19 15:59:38\nBack to homepage\n    <script src=\"https://www.quantserve.com/quant.js\"></script><script>                                           \n QuentinJS.initialize();                                   \n </script>\nDisclaimer: Boostprep Inc. does not warrant or guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of any information or materials on our websites, including, but not limited to, user questions and their related responses, notes, and explanations.

Given information includes: x + y = 153, and x/y = 0.7. We are asked to find y \u2013 x. This means we need to find y and x, and then subtract x from y. To find y and x, we will use the given information. Given that x/y = 0.7, we can set up an equation by multiples \u20180.7y\u2019 to get x. This will be x = 0.7y. Next, we will substitute this value of x into the equation x + y = 153 to get 0.7y + y = 153. Now we can simplify the equation by combining like terms. 0.7y + y = 153 can be simplified to 1.7y = 153. Divide both sides by 1.7 to get y = ",
        " 53\nExplanation: We are given three criteria:\n1) $x + y = 153$.\n2) $\\frac{x}{y} = 0.7$.\n3) We are asked to find $y - x$.\nFrom the second criterion, we can express $x$ as $x = 0.7y$.\nThen, we can plug this expression for $x$ into the first criterion to obtain:\n$0.7y + y = 153$.\nWe can simplify this to $1.7y = 153$, and then divide both sides by $1.7$ to find $y = 90$.\nSo, $x = 0.7y = 0.7 \\times 90 = 63$, and we can easily find $y - x = 90 - 63 = 27$.",
