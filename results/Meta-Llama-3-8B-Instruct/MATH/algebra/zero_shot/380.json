        " \nWhen $0 \\le x \\le 3$, $f(x) = 9 - 2x$, and $0 \\le f(x) \\le 3$. If we take $0 \\le f(x) \\le 3$ and substitute it into $f$ again, we get that $f(f(x)) = 9 - 2f(x),$ so $9 - 2f(x) = f(9-2x)$, and $f(9-2x) = x$. So, this means that $9-2f(x) = x$ when $0 \\le x \\le 3$. Rearranging this, we get that $f(x) = 4.5-x$, which cannot be equal to our original $f(x) = 9-2x$ since that only works when $x\\le 3$ but not for all $x$. So, $x$ must not be less than or equal to 3. Next, we test $x=4$ but $f(4)$ does not work. Now, let $x>3$ and we see that $f(f(x))=f(ax+b)=x$. So if we let $ax+b>3$ so that we can use our condition of $x>3$, then we find that $f(ax+b)=ax+b$ when $ax+b>3$. The only solution is $a=1$ and $b=1$.

Let us choose a value for $x$ and see how $f(x)$ affects it. Let $x=2$. Then $f(x)=9-2\\cdot2=5$. This will be the input into $f(x)$, so $f(f(2))=f(5)$. \nIf $x=5$, the function is still $9-2x$, so $f(5)=9-2\\cdot5=3$. Now $f(f(2))=f(3)$. \nIn the interval $(3,\\infty)$, $f(x)=ax+b$. Plugging $x=3$ into this equation gives us $3a+b=3$. Next, note that $f(3)=ax+b$, so $f(f(2))=ax+b=3$. Now we have two equations with two unknowns. If we subtract this from our other equation, we get $(a-2)x-b=-0$, which means $a$ and $b$ can be anything and this equation will still hold. This is because $x$ can be an arbitrary value. \nNow, let $x=3$. Then $f(x)=ax+b$, and since $f(f(2))=3$, we have $ax+b=3$. \nWe know that $f(x)$ has the property $f(f(x))=x$, therefore $f(3)=f(a)$.

If $f(ax+b)=ax+b$, then $f(ax+b)=f(f(ax+b))$ by definition. If $ax+b\\le 3$, then $f(ax+b)=9-(2ax+2b)$. In this case, we obtain\n$$9-(2ax+2b)=ax+b,\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad2ax+2b=ax+b+9.$$This has no solutions, so there is no $x$ for which $ax+b\\le 3$ and satisfies this equation. Therefore, we conclude that $x > 3$.\nLet\u2019s consider the derivative of $f$.\n$$f'(x)=\\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{cl}\n-2 & \\text{if } x \\le 3, \\\\\na & \\text{if } x > 3.\n\\end{array}\n\\right.$$For all $x$, $f'(x)$ is a constant, and it is equal for both cases. We have $f'(x)=-2$ for $x\\le 3$ and $f'(x)=a$ for $x>3$. In both",
        " \\begin{align*} f(f(x))&=x \\\\ f(x)&=x \\quad \\text{for } x\\le3 \\\\ f(x)&=9-2x \\quad \\text{for } x>3 \\\\ \\end{align*}\nFor $x\\le3,$ $$\\begin{cases}9-2x&\\le3\\\\9-2x&=x\\end{cases}$$ $$9=3+x,\\quad x=6$$ This doesn't make sense as $x\\le3.$ So $9-2x=x$ has no solution when $x\\le3.$\nFor $x>3$, $$\\begin{cases}ax+b&>3\\\\ax+b&=x\\end{cases}$$ $$ax+b=x,\\quad b=x-a-1$$ Thus, $f(x)=x-a-1$ for $x>3.$\nNow, we have two equations for $x\\le3$ and $x>3$:\n\\begin{align*} f(x)&=x\\quad\\text{for }x\\le3\\\\ f(x)&=x-a-1\\quad\\text{for }x>3\\\\ \\end{align*}\nWe should deduce that these are the same equation.\nLet $x=3$.\n\\begin{align*} f(x)&=x\\quad\\text{for }x\\le3\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\quad f(3)&=3\\\\ &=9-2(3)=3\\\\ \\end{align*}\nLet $x=4$.\n\\begin{align*} f(x)&=x-a-1\\quad\\text{for }x>3\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\quad f(4)&=4-a-1=3\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\quad a&=0\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad b=3\\\\ \\end{align*}\nThus, $a+b=0+3=\\boxed{3}.$\n### Final Answer: The final answer is 3.

        " Well, if $x \\le 3$, then $f(f(x)) = f(9-2x) = ax+b$ and $x = f(ax+b).$ So we need \\begin{align*}\nf(ax+b) &= 9 - 2x,\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 9-2(ax+b) &= x,\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 9 - 2ax - 2b &= x,\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad -1(2a-1)x+9&=-2b,\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad f(x)&=2b+9 \\text{ when }x\\le3.\n\\end{align*} Then we must have $2b+9 = 9-2x$ for all $x \\le 3$, so $2b = 0$, and then $b=0$.  This means that $f(x)=9-2x$ for $x\\le3$.  Now, since $f(x)$ is continuous at $x=3$, we have $$3 = \\lim_{x\\rightarrow3^-}f(x) = \\lim_{x\\rightarrow3^-}(9-2x)=3,$$which is true, so $f(x)$ is continuous at $x=3$.  Since $f(x)$ is continuous at $x=3$ and both of $f(x)=9-2x$ and $f(x)=ax+b$ are continuous, it follows that $ax+b$ agrees with $9-2x$ at the point $x=3$, which means we must have \\begin{align*}\na(3)+b&=9-2(3)=3,\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 3a&=6,\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad a&=2.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $a+b = 2+0 = \\boxed{2}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2.

        " \nFor the first part of this problem, we know that $f(f(x)) = x$ for all $x.$ Further, $f(x)$ is defined as $9-2x$ for $x\\le3$, so we have $f(x)=x$ for $x\\le3$. In particular, this means that $f(f(x))=x$ when $x\\le3$, which is true by substitution. \nThe second part of $f(x)$ is defined as $ax+b$ for $x>3$, so we have $f(x)=ax+b$ for $x>3$ as well.

        " For this kind of problem, we first consider what type of equation it might be. It does seem that $f$ is an encoding and decoding formula. Next, we want to find out what value does $f$ takes when $0 < x <3$, and what value $f$ takes when $x \\ge 3$. When $x < 3$, then $f(x) = 9 - 2x$, and $f(f(x)) = f(9 - 2x)$. Thus, our function is:\n\\begin{align*}f(\\underbrace{9-2x}_{f(x)}&=\\underbrace{9-2\\left(\\frac{9-2x+9}{2}\\right)}_{f(9-2x)}\\\\&= 9-2\\left(\\frac{18 - 2x}{2}\\right) = 9 - (18-x) = x.\\end{align*}\nSince $f(f(x))=x$ when $x < 3$, then $f(x) = 9-2x$ is the only possible value of $f$. Therefore, when $x < 3$, $f(x) = f(f(x))=x$. When $3 < x$, we still know that $f(f(x)) = x$, and we have $f(x) = ax+b$.\nThese two formulas will lead two more formulas. Let\u2019s solve $f(9-2x)=x$ for $9-2x$, and $\\frac{18-2x}{2}=x$. We can solve:\n\\begin{align*}\\frac{18-2x}{2} = x &\\Rightarrow 2x = 18-2x\\Rightarrow 4x = 18\\Rightarrow x = 4.5\\\\&\\Rightarrow f(4.5) = f(9-2(4.5))=f(0.5) = 9-2(4.5) = -1\\Rightarrow f(-1) = 0.5.\\end{align*}\nWe again solve $f(x)=x$. Thus, $f(f(x))=x$, then $f(x)=x$. $f(-1) = 0.5$, so $f(0.5)=-1$. Thus, $-1=9-2(0.5)$. $a+b=\\boxed{10}$\nFinal Answer: The",
        " \u00a0Let's approach $f(f(x)) = x$ step by step with an example.\nWe know that $f(1)=9-2\\cdot1=7$, $f(7)=9-2\\cdot7=-5$, so $f(f(1))=-5.$ Since we know that $f(f(1))=-5,$ we now need to find $x$ such that $f(x)=-5.$ From the second part of the definition, we have that $f(x)=ax+b=-5$ when $x>3.$ This means that $a=-1$ and $b=-5$. So, $f(x)=ax+b=-x-5$ when $x>3.$\n###  Going further...\nIn order to prove that $f(f(x))=x$, we need to show that it is true for all $x$.\nTake note that $f(f(x))=f(f(f(4)))$ because the function $f$ is $x$-invariant.\nLet\u2019s examine the domains and ranges for our functions. According to the first part of the definition, $f(x)=9-2x$ when $x\\leq 3.$ The range this time is $\\left[9-2(3)+1,9-2(0)+1\\right]=\\left[5,9\\right].$ The second part of the definition implicates that $f(x)=ax+b$ when $x>3.$ Since $a=-1$, then our range becomes $\\left(-ax+b, -ax+b+1\\right)=\\left(-x-5, x-5+1\\right)=\\left[-x-5,x+4\\right].$\nSo the function $f$ is well-defined on the domain $\\left[0,3\\right]\\cup\\left[3,\\infty\\right)$.\n### Final answer:\u00a0 Therefore, $a+b=-1+(-5)=\\boxed{-6}$.\nNote: The direct approach may have looked challenging. This approach explained the working logic, and surprisingly, it simplified the working steps.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -6. I hope it is correct.",
        " For some constants $a$ and $b,$ let \\[f(x) = \\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{cl}\n9 - 2x & \\text{if } x \\le 3, \\\\\nax + b & \\text{if } x > 3.\n\\end{array}\n\\right.\\]The function $f$ has the property that $f(f(x)) = x$ for all $x.$ What is $a + b?$\nLet\u2019s think of the equation $f(f(x)) = x$ step by step.\n\u2022 For $x \\le 3,$ $f(x) = 9 - 2x.$ So, $f(f(x)) = f(9 - 2x) = a(9 - 2x) + b,$ since $9 - 2x > 3.$ Equating this to $x,$ we get $a(9-2x) + b = x.$ When $x = 1,$ $a(7) + b = 1,$ so $7a + b = 1.$ When $x = 2,$ $a(5) + b = 2,$ so $5a + b = 2.$ When $x = 3,$ $9a + b = 3,$ so $4a + b = 1.$ This system of equations is inconsistent, so there are no values for $a$ and $b$ such that $f(f(x)) = x$ for $x \\le 3.$\n\u2022 For $x > 3,$ $f(x) = ax + b.$ So, $f(f(x)) = f(ax + b) = a(ax + b) + b = a^2x + ab + b.$ Equating this to $x$ gives $a^2x + ab + b = x,$ or $a^2x + ab + (b-1) = 0.$ Since this is a linear equation involving powers of $x$, it can only have a solution for each value of $x$ by setting $x = 0.$ This is not possible, since $a^2x + ab + (b-1)$ goes to $+ \\infty$ as $x$ goes to $+ \\infty,$ but it should be zero for all $x.$ Therefore, there are no values for $a$ and $b$ such that $f(f(x)) = x$",
        " Let $x \\le 3$, then $f(x) = 9 - 2x$, and $f(f(x)) = f(9-2x)$.  We know $f(9-2x) = (9-2(9-2x))+b$.\nThen, we must have $x = (9-2(9-2x))+b$. Solving for $x$, we see $-2x = 9-2x+1\\Rightarrow 2x = 10\\Rightarrow x=5$. This is only possible if $b=9$.\n### On the other hand, suppose $x > 3$, then $f(x) = ax + b$, and $f(f(x)) = f(ax+b) = a(ax+b)+b$. Then $x = a(ax+b)+b$, which is true only if $a^2 + ab -1 = 0$, implying $a$ must equal $-1$. If we plug this back in, we will find $b = 4$. Summing it all up, we can write that $a + b = -1 + 9 = \\boxed{8}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 8.
