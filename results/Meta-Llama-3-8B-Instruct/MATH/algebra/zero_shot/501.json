If the given data points \\left( {x_1,y_1} \\right) and \\left( {x_2,y_2} \\right) are given, the distance between those two points can be calculated using the formula: $$d = \\sqrt {{\\left( {{x_2} - {x_1}} \\right)^2} + {\\left( {{y_2} - {y_1}} \\right)^2}} $$ The distance we are asking for in this problem is the distance between points (2,-6) and (-4,3). So, all we need to do is substitute (2,-6) and (-4,3) in the formula, $$d = \\sqrt {{\\left( { - 4 - 2} \\right)^2} + {\\left( {3 + 6} \\right)^2}} = \\sqrt {{\\left( { - 6} \\right)^2} + {\\left( {9} \\right)^2}} = \\sqrt {36 + 81} = \\sqrt {117} = 3\\sqrt {13}$$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 3\\sqrt{13}.

        " We are asked to find the distance, in units, between the points (2,-6) and (-4,3).

Thousands of books written in Western languages, reading us the clauses of this book is not a very difficult thing. Each point must be seen in this way. Finally finding the ability to determine the shortest distance between two points. When this coefficient search, I thought of the time of the search distance, which the search distance was the square root of two minus two and the square root of minus six and four minus three. Calculation is not difficult calculate it. Now, we only need to get a solve that is square root of 117. So, after solving, I got this answer I finally got.\nsummary: In this book, the clause of distance is used, it can be seen from the answer that there are 9 13. Calculating the distance was also easy. Finally, the answer is the square root of 117, 3",

I am here longer than I will be gone.  Special thanks to you for your goodness and encouraging word, which will surely translate to more helpful responses from now on.  Practice, practice, practice,  you will get it and survive in this great world of  math and counterintuitive expressions.  Which is what I, Rosen, like the most, for the right or wrong.  Practice also means taking calculated mistakes and turning them into good data for your own learning. Never worry about  showing errors. Error are just part of learning process.  Thank you once again.  If I hadn't been already grateful, what I have done now should make you pay back me.  God refuse to let my roof not hold the different ways I can give you. And after giving you so much,  my roof is okay. I see is the rafters, I have the coresponding beams,  so up, down, up, down. The way it  should be.  Benefit in all ways to threefold learned shit.
