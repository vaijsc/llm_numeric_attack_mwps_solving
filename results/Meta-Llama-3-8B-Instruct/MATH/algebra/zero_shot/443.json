Because $\\sqrt{81}$ is 9, we can write the problem as $20=9+\\sqrt{n}$. Now, if we subtract 9 from both sides, we simply get $\\sqrt{n} = 11$. Squaring both sides, we get $n = 121$, which, of course, is not the correct answer.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 319.

        " If $\\sqrt{400}=\\sqrt{81}+\\sqrt{n}$, then we want to isolate $\\sqrt{n}$ in terms of radicals. To solve for $\\sqrt{n}$, we subtract $\\sqrt{81}$ from both sides. That means we get $\\sqrt{400}-\\sqrt{81}=\\sqrt{n}$.\nTo evaluate $\\sqrt{400}-\\sqrt{81}$, we could actually simplify it into a decimal, but we can\u2019t simplify the right side because we don\u2019t have a numerator and denominator in the given equation. \nBy the way, when you are solving radical equations, remember that you can add or subtract radicals across equals sides if you have the same radicals on the left and right, but you cannot lump things like this, such as $\\sqrt{a}+\\sqrt{b}=\\sqrt{a+b}$\nSo, $\\sqrt{400} = 20$ and $\\sqrt{81} = 9$. Therefore, we obtain $\\sqrt{n} = 20-9 = \\boxed{11}$, and $n = \\boxed{121}$. There are two types of radical equations, equations with a radical on both sides of the equation and equations with a radical on only one side of the equation. You can always subtract or add radicals on the same side of the equation. Additionally, if you see numbers that are perfect squares on the same side of the equation as a radical, you can simplify the right hand side. For instance, $\\sqrt{16} = 4$.\nI hope it is helpful. If you have any more questions or need further clarification, let me know.\nThere are many similar questions you could have. Let me know if you have any more radical questions.

        " First solve the equation $\\sqrt{400}=\\sqrt{81}+\\sqrt{n}$:\nNow $400$ is a perfect square. We know that $160^{2} = 25600$, but $400$ is too small. So, $400 = 20^{2}$.\nSimilarly, $81$ is a perfect square. $9^{2}=81$.\nNow write in the equation: \n$\\sqrt{20^{2}}=\\sqrt{9^{2}}+\\sqrt{n}$.\nSimplify: \n$20=\\sqrt{9^{2}}+\\sqrt{n}$.\nFurther, $9^{2} = 81$, and simplify: \n$20=9+\\sqrt{n}$.\nTo get rid of the radical, subtract $9$ from both sides of the equation.\nYou get $11 = \\sqrt{n}$. Finally, to get rid of the radical, square both sides. \n$n = $(square both sides). You then have $n = 121$. This is the answer. Final Answer: The final answer is 121. I hope it is correct. ",

        " First, we analyze $\\sqrt{400}$: Since $400=20^2$, and that $\\sqrt{a^2}=|a|,$ $\\sqrt{400}=20.$\n### Second, let\u2019s analyze $\\sqrt{81}$: Since $81=9^2,$ $\\sqrt{81}=9.$\n### Finally, let\u2019s analyze $\\sqrt{n}$: We substitute our findings to get $20 = 9 + \\sqrt{n}.$  Now we solve for $\\boxed{n}$ by subtracting $9$ from each side:\n$$20-9=\\sqrt{n}\\Rightarrow\\boxed{n=11}.$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 11.
