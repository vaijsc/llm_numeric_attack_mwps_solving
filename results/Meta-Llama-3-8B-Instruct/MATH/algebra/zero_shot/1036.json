In particular, we are given that $a_1 = 1$, $a_2 = a_1 r = \\frac{1}{2}$, and $a_3 = a_2 r = \\frac{1}{4}$. We want to find $a_4 = a_3 r = \\frac{1}{8} r$, and $a_5 = a_4 r = \\frac{1}{16}$.\nNotice that $r = \\frac{1}{2}$, because $r = \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{1/2}{1} = \\frac{1}{2}$. Now, our terms are $a_4 = a_3 r = \\frac{1}{8} r$, and $a_5 = a_4 r = \\frac{1}{16} r$. The sum of $a_4$ and $a_5$ is $\\frac{1}{8} r + \\frac{1}{16} r = \\frac{\\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{16}}{1} r = \\frac{3}{16} r$.

There isn\u2019t any gap in the geometric sequence.  This works well. This is my solution. We can also use the generating function for the terms of the geometric sequence directly.  We know that every term in the sequence is some function of the first term multiplied by $r$, which is 1/2. The formula for the term in the geometric sequence is $1 \\cdot (\\frac{1}{2})^x$. If we use that and multiply, we know that the four terms of the geometric sequence are 1, 1/2, 1/4 and 1/8. Thus, we can write the fourth term in another way as: $a_{4} = a_{3}r = \\frac",

To add this together we need to find $r$, we know this is $\\frac{1}{2}$ so $1*r^{5} = \\frac{1}{8}r$  and  $1*r^{6} = \\frac{1}{8}r^2$ become $r^{5} = \\frac{1}{8}$  and  $r^{6} = \\frac{1}{8}r$.  We can see that these two equations are the same except for the $r$ at the end.  If we multiply $r^{5} = \\frac{1}{8}$ by $r$ we will get the second equation.
