        " The length of the diameter of a circle is the distance between the two end points.

To do this, add up the x coordinates and divide by 2. This will give us $cx$ = (3 - 1)/2 = 1. Now do the same to find the y coordinates. $cy$ = (2 + 2)/2 = 2. The center of the circle is (1,2). ### Next Step: From there, we can find the distance from the center of the circle to either A or B. We can use the distance formula: distance = square root[(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2]. To use this, we can plug in the values for A and B. Distance from center to A = square root[(-1 - 1)^2 + (-2 - 2)^2] = square root[4 + 4] = square root[8] = 2 sqrt[2]. We can do the same for B. Distance from center to B = square root[(3 - 1)^2 + (2 - 2)^2] = square root[4 + 0] = square root[4] = 2. At this point, we know the distances between the center and A, and the center and B, so we can use the formula: area = pi * r^2. The radius is half the distance between A and B. r = distance between A and B / 2. So r = 2 sqrt[2] / 2 = sqrt[2]. Now we can plug all this into the formula. area = pi * r^2 = pi * (sqrt[2])^2 = 2pi. The answer is 2pi. Final Answer: The final answer is 2\\pi.
