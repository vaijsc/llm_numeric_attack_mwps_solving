Therefore, multiplying $-2$ by $r^3$ gives us $16.$ So, $r^3=-8.$ Rather than finding $r,$ we note that to get to the fourteenth term from the fifth term, we multiply by $r$ nine times, which is the same as multiplying by $r^3$ three times.

I hope it is correct. This problem requires knowledge of logarithms, exponentials, and algebraic manipulation. We will need to lose that knowledge to solve the problem with certainty.\nThe solution can be broken down into several steps. First, we note that the second term of a geometric sequence of real numbers is $-2$ and the fifth term is $16$.\nFor a geometric sequence, $x_{n} = r^n \\cdot x_{0},$ where $r$ is the ratio between each term and $x_{0}$ is the initial term.\nUsing the information given, we can write $x_{1} = r \\cdot x_{0} = -2,$ which gives $r = -2/x_{0}.$\nAdditionally, $x_{4} = r^4 \\cdot x_{0} = 16,$ which gives $(r^4)x_{0} = 16.$\nDividing the two equations, we get $r^3 = 8,$ which implies $r = 2^{1/3}.$\nNow we can find the value of $x_{0}$ by using the fact that $x_{0",
        "  The geometric sequence begins as follows: $$s_1 = a = \\left(\\frac{-2}{r}\\right)$$ $$s_2 = -2 = ar$$ $$s_3 = ar^2 = -2r$$ $$s_4 = ar^3 = 2r^2$$ $$s_5 = ar^4 = -8r$$ $$s_6 = ar^5 = -2r^3$$ $$s_{14} = ar^{13} = -2r^{-1}$$ Now that we have figured out the sequence, we substitute the values we know. $a = \\left(\\frac{-2}{r}\\right)$ and $s_5 = 16 = ar^4 = \\left(\\frac{-2}{r}\\right)r^4 = \\frac{-2r^3}{r} = -2r^3$ This means that $-2r^3 = 16$, $r^3 = -8$, and $r = -2$. Therefore, we substitute these values to find $a$. $a = \\left(\\frac{-2}{-2}\\right) = 1$. So $s_{14} = ar^{13} = (1)(-2)^{13} = -2^{14} = -16,384$.\n### ",

        " Theorem: If the sequence is geometric, its $n^{\\text{th}}$ term is equal to the first term times the common ratio raised to the power $n - 1.$\nThis means that the sequence will have a term that is equal to the first term multiplied by the common ratio.

        " \nWe are given a geometric sequence. A geometric sequence is a sequence of numbers where the difference between any term and the term immediately preceding it has the same value. In other words, there exists $r$ such that\n$a_{n+1}=ra_n$$for all$ n$.$ To be more specific, let the sequence be$a_1,a_2,a_3,\\dots$. We have given $a_2 = -2$ and $a_5 = 16$. Now, let\u2019s use the first term, $a_1$. Let\u2019s call it $a$.\nOne equation we have is $a_2 = a*r = -2 \\implies a = \\frac{-2}{r}$\nNow we need to use $a_5$. We have that $a_5 = a_2*r^3 = 16$\nBut we also know what $a_2$ is, $a_2 = -2$.\nSo $-2*r^3 = 16 \\implies r^3 = -8 \\implies r = -2$ or $r = \\sqrt[3]{-8}$\nNow we can solve for $a$. We know $a = \\frac{-2}{r}$.\nWhen $r = -2$ we have $a = \\frac{-2}{-2} = 1$\nwhen $r = \\sqrt[3]{-8}$, we have $a = \\frac{-2}{\\sqrt[3]{-8}}$ = $\\frac{-2}{-2} = 1$\nWe found that $a = 1$.\nNow we can find $a_{14}$ using the equation $a_{n+1} = r*a_n$.\nSo $a_{14} = r * a_{13}$\n$a_{13} = r * a_{12}$\nAnd so on.\nNotice that the $r$\u2019s cancel out.\n$a_{14} = \\boxed{1 * r^13 = 1 * (-2)^{13} = -2048}$\n### How many words is this essay? \nThis essay is approximately 330 words.

        " First, we want to realize that the given information could be represented as follows:\n$a_2=y_1=-2,$\n$a_5=y_4=y_3=y_2=16.$\nWe are interested in $a_{14}=y_6\\ldots y_{13}$.\n### Solution:\nSince the sequence represents a geometric sequence with common ratio $r$, the $n^{\\text{th}}$ term of the sequence can be written as $a_n = ar^{n-1}$.\n### Solution Continued:\nIn our case, we have $\\boxed{a_2 = -2 = ar^1}$ and $\\boxed{a_5 = 16 = ar^4}$. We can therefore find that $\\boxed{r=a^4a_2 = a^4(-2)= -\\frac{1}{2}a}$. From this, we know that $a_5 = 16 = \\frac{1}{2}a^4$, so that $\\boxed{a^4 = 32}$, and $\\boxed{a=2}$.\n### Solution Continued:\nWith these values in place, it becomes simple enough to calculate the fourteenth term. Out of simplicity, let\u2019s calculate the fourth term first. We know $\\boxed{a_4=ar^3=ar(-\\frac{1}{2}a)^2=\\frac{1}{2}}$.\n### Solution Continued:\nOnce we see $a_4$, it\u2019s much simpler to find $a_{14}$: $a_{14} = ar^{13} = a(-\\frac{1}{2}a)^{12} = a (\\frac{1}{2^{12}}) \\frac{1}{2} a = \\boxed{\\frac{a^{2}}{2^{13}} = \\frac{(2)^2}{2^{13}} = \\frac{4}{2^{12}} = \\frac{2^2}{2^{12}} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2^10} = \\frac{1}{1024}} }$.\n### Solution Continued:\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\frac{1}{1024}.

        " The first term of the geometric sequence is $-2/ r$\nWe are given that the second term of the geometric sequence is $-2$. Let $a$ be the first term of the geometric sequence. We know that the geometric sequence is written as $a, ar, ar^2, ar^3, \\cdots$ where $r$ is the real number to the power of. So, we have: $$a r=-2$$\nHence, the first term of the geometric sequence is $-2/r$.\n### We can now calculate the fifth term\nWe have the first term $(-2/r)$ and the common ratio $r$. Now we need to calculate the fifth term. We know that the fifth term is $16$. Since we are given the first term and the common ratio, we can write it as $$16 = (-2/r) \\times r^4$$\n### To simplify the equation above\nWe have: $$16 = -2r^4$$\nDivide both sides by $-2$ gives you: $$8 = r^4$$\nTake the fourth root gives you: $$2 = r$$\n### Now, we are able to calculate the fourteenth term\nThe fourteenth term of the geometric sequence is $(\u22122/r) \\times r^{14}$, so we need to substitute $r=2$ $$(-2/2) \\times (2)^{14}$$\n### Now, let\u2019s simplify the equation\nWe have: $$-1 \\times 2^{14}$$\nWe know that $2^4=16$.

        " We have to represent the sequence in form of an arithmetic series. Arithmetic series can be defined as an arrangement of numbers in which each term after the first is obtained by adding a fixed constant to the preceding term. We can say that the first term is a and the constant difference is d.\n### The sequence can be written as: a, a d, a d^2, a d^3, a d^4, a d^13 ( since the fourteenth term) \u00a0= -2\nNow we have to find the value of a and d.

The question states that the second term is -2, and the fifth term is 16, which can be used to find the common ratio and the first term. Once these values are known, the fourteenth term can be found. The key to the solution is to algebraically manipulate the information given to find the common ratio and the first term, which can then be used to find the fourteenth term.$## Solution: Let the first term be denoted by a, and the common ratio by r.

        " \n$\\boxed{2}$  ### Final Answer: The final answer is 2. I hope it is correct.  I have divided the work into different steps here and will be helpful for future learning.  We know that in the geometric sequence, there are two relations: the first is that there is a negative product of consecutive terms, and the second is that if we take the ratio of the consecutive term, it becomes the constant. Geometric Series So let us implement the concept of proportion.  The fifth term is $16$. Now, we can express the ratio between the third, fourth, and fifth terms.  Let the ratio between the second and first term be $r$.    Now we find the fifth term.   We have the fourth term:   Now using the ratio between consecutive terms, we get:   Dividing both sides of the equation by the fourth term.   As we find the fourth term, we get $-2r = -r$. We can simplify $r$ Now $-2r = -r \\to -2r+r=0 \\to -r = 0 \\to r = 1/sub> - 2r = -r \\to -2r+r=0 \\to -r = 0 \\to r = 1$rl>/>Now we have the ratio between the second and first term. $r$ also becomes $1$.    The ratio between the second term is $-2$ and the first term is $-2$, and we can take $r$ to be $1$.  In addition, Geometric Series http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~uctymw/newton/image008.gif. In other words, if we know the second term and the fifth term, we can use the ratio between consecutive terms: $r = \\frac{16}{-2}$, 16 ) / (-2 ))196)/(-2)29)/(-2) We simplify the denominator and get: 136.  Then we can simplify:  1 / 136 -> 14 We now have the value of the fourteenth term.    1 / 136 -> 14   The answer is $2$.
