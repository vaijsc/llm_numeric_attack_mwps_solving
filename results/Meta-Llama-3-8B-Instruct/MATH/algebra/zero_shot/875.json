        " \nSince $h(1) = 5$, we have $a + b = 5$. On the other hand, since $h(-1) = 1$, we have $-a + b = 1$. Now, let\u2019s solve for $a$ and $b$ using these two equations. We can set these two equations equal to each other to get $a + b = -a + b$, which gives $2a = 4$, so $a = 2$. Substituting this back into one of these equations, we get $2 + b = 5$, which gives $b = 3$.  So, we have $h(x) = 2x + 3$.

In particular, we know that when x=1, h(x) is equal to 5 and that when x=-1, h(x) is equal to 1.\n2. **Extracting the values of a and b**: We can use these conditions to extract the values of a and b.\n3. **H(1)=a(1)+b=5**: We can write the first condition as a linear equation: a+b=5. We know that b=a+4 from the second condition. So, we can substitute this back into the equation to get 2a=1.\n4. **Solving for a**: We can now solve the equation 2a=1 for a:\n2a=1\na=1/2\n5. **Finding b**: We know that b=a+4.

        "  At this point, I see two ways to answer this question.\n#### Way 1:\nWe know that $h(1) = 5$ and $h(-1) = 1$.  We can write $h(x) = 5x$, and then $h(-1) = -5$ is no longer equal to $1$, so we must scale by a constant factor.  To ensure $h(-1) = 1$, the function $h(x) = ax + b$ must then be $h(x) = -x + 6$, assuming $h(x)$ is linear in $x$.  This means that $h(6) = 6 + 6 = \\boxed{12}$.",
