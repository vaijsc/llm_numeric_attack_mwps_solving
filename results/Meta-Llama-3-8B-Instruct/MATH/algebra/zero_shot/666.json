To remove the negative sign, we can multiply both sides of the equation by \\(-1\\):\n\\[\n4(5-a)^2 \\div 3 = 12\n\\]\n5. Now, multiply both sides by \\(3\\) to eliminate the divisor:\n\\[\n4(5-a)^2 = 12 \\cdot 3\n\\]\nCalculating \\(12 \\cdot 3\\):\n\\[\n12 \\cdot 3 = 36\n\\]\nThus, we rewrite the equation:\n\\[\n4(5-a)^2 = 36\n\\]\n6.

        " (Working Out Loud)\nSince division and multiplication are inverse operations, we can turn the division problem into multiplication by flipping the second two numbers in the equation. Let\u2019s do that, then simplify things. We now have\n$$(3)5^2-4(5-a)^2\\cdot\\frac{1}{3}=63$$This is a linear equation, so we can solve it using standard methods. Subtract 63 from each side, then multiply each side by -3. We get\n$$-5^2+4(5-a)^2=-189$$Next, we have to get the $(5-a)^2$ all by itself. Let\u2019s distribute the $4$:\n$$-5^2+4(5-a)^2=-189$$ $$=-5^2+4(25-10a+a^2)=-189$$Simplify things a bit by combining the constants:\n$$-5^2+100-40a+4a^2=-189$$Combine the constants on the left side of the equation:\n$$-25-40a+4a^2=-189$$Subtract -25 to get the other side equal to zero:\n$$-40a+4a^2=-164$$We want to get rid of the $-40a$ by combining like terms. We can do that by subtracting $-40a$ from each side:\n$$4a^2-40a=-164$$Now we\u2019re almost done. To get the $(4a-20)$ as one number, we can selectively distribute a $4$ to one of the $a$s. We want to distribute a $4$ to the $a$. We get:\n$$4a^2-40a+20=0$$The left side of the equation is a quadratic expression. We can factor it by making sure the first and last terms are divisible by the same number, which is $4$:\n$$(2a-10)(2a-2)=0$$We know that when a quadratic has two roots, these roots can be found by setting each of the like terms equal to zero:\n$$2a-10=0$$$$2a-2=0$$If we add 10 to $2a-10$, we get $2a$. If we subtract 2 from $2a-2$, we also get $2a$:\n$$2a=0$$$$2a=2$$$$a=\\frac{10}{2}=5$$$$",

        " Well, first let\u2019s combine the terms that are being multiplied together on the left side. We have $(3)(5^2)-4(5-a)^2/3.$Next, we can simplify this expression.

Then, we have\n$$(3)(5^2)-4(5-a)^2/3=(15)(3)-4(5-a)^2/3=45-4(5-a)^2/3.$$Next, notice that the 4 and 3 are in the denominator of the fraction, so we can combine these, which gives us $45-4(5-a)^2/12.$Now, we wish to get rid of the fraction, so we can multiply both sides of the equation by 12 to have\n$$540-4(5-a)^2 = 756.$$Subtracting 540 from both sides of this equation, we have $$-4(5-a)^2 = 216.$$Dividing both sides of the equation by -4, we have $$(5-a)^2=54.$$Taking the square root of both sides, we have $5-a = 3 \\quad\\text{or}\\quad 5-a = -9.$ Solving for $a$ in both equations, we have $$a = 2 \\quad\\text{or}\\quad a = -4.$$And it is $\\boxed{-4+2 = 0}$, but you also need to tell what $a$ is equal to.\n### The final answer is 0.
