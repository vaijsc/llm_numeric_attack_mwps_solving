        " Since $a_1,a_2,a_3,\\dots$ is an arithmetic sequence, we know that $a_2 = a_1+d$ for some constant $d$.

Since we know that $\\frac{a_4}{a_2} = 3$, we can set up the following equation:\n$$\\frac{a_2+d}{a_2}=3$$Solving this equation for $d$ yields:\n$$d=2a_2$$Since we know that $a_3 = a_2$, we can use the same logic to find $\\frac{a_5}{a_3}$. We know that $a_5 = a_3+d$, so we can set up the following equation:\n$$\\frac{a_3+d}{a_3}=?$$We\u2019re asked to find $\\frac{a_5}{a_3}$, which is the same as $\\frac{a_3+d}{a_3}$. Since $d=2a_2=2a_3$, we can substitute this value of $d$ to find that:\n$$\\frac{a_3+d}{a_3}=\\frac{a_3+2a_3}{a_3}=\\boxed{3}$$So the answer is $\\boxed{3}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 3. I hope it is correct.",
        " There are several ways to solve this problem. This is how it goes:\n\\begin{align*}",
        " First, to see if the sequence is arithmetic, we must check the condition: $$a_n=a_1+(n-1)d$$\nwhere $d$ is the common difference. We are given $\\frac{a_4}{a_2}=3$, so we can write:\n$$\\frac{a_1+3d}{a_1+d}=3\\Leftrightarrow a_1+3d=3a_1+3d\\Leftrightarrow 2a_1=0\\Leftrightarrow a_1=0$$\nBut this is not possible because the first term of an arithmetic sequence cannot be 0.  Therefore, we can conclude that the arithmetic sequence must not satisfy $\\frac{a_4}{a_2}=3$.  So, there is only one answer:\u00a0 undefined.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is undefined. I hope it is correct.",
