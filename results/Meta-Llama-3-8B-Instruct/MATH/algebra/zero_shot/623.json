        " Let J be John's age and D be the dad's age. We have the following equations: J = D - 31 and J + D = 53\nJohn is 31 years younger than his dad.\nSince John is J years old and his dad is D years old, we have J = D - 31.\nLet's now use the fact that the sum of their ages is 53: J + D = 53.\nWe also know that J = D - 31, so we can write D - 31 + D = 53.\nThen, we have 2D - 31 = 53 and 2D = 53 + 31.\n### Explanation:\nNow, we can solve for D. Let's subtract 53 from both sides of the equation and we get 2D = 84. This can be done since subtraction doesn't change the number. Finally, let's divide both sides of the equation by 2 to get D = 42.\nD = 42\n### Solution: We have that D = 42, which means John's dad is 42 years old.",
        " If John is 31 years younger than his dad, his dad's age is $x$. John's age would be $x-31$. Also, the sum of their ages is 53 years. We can write an equation using this information:\n\\begin{aligned} x+(x-31)&=53 \\\\\\\\ 2x-31&=53 \\\\\\\\ 2x&=53+31 \\\\\\\\ 2x&=84 \\\\\\\\ x&=42 \\end{aligned} So, John's dad is 42 years old.\ntake the position of two variables in this case, in this case j for john and f for father, so we have j = f -31. Then, as the sum of their ages is 53, we have f+j=53. f + f-31 = 53, 2f-31 = 53, 2f = 53 + 31, 2f = 84, f = 42, So he is 42 years old.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 42. I hope it is correct.",

        " 31 years younger than his dad. \nso John's age is 31 years less than his dad's age. \n### Formulas:\nLet\u2019s think step by step.\nLet John's dad's age be x. Let John's age be y.\nThen, we can write y = x - 31.",
        " \nThe sum of John\u2019s age and his father\u2019s age is 53, and John\u2019s age is 31 less than his father\u2019s age. So, if John\u2019s age is x, his father's age is x + 31, and their sum is x + (x + 31) = 53. \nCombining like terms, 2x + 31 = 53, so subtract 31 from both sides: 2x = 22. \nDivide both sides by 2: x = 11. \nSo John is 11 years old. His father is x + 31 = 11 + 31 = 42 years old.",
        " x: the age of the dad, y: the age of the son\n1. John is 31 years younger than his dad, so y= x - 31\n2. The sum of their ages is 53 years, so x + y = 53\nReplace y with x - 31 in equation 2, x + (x - 31) = 53\n- Simplify, 2x - 31 = 53\n3. Add 31 to both sides, 2x = 84\n4. Divide both sides by 2, x = 42\n5. Now find the age of the son, y = x - 31 = 42 - 31 = 11\n6. So John\u2019s dad is 42 years old.",
        " \n1. The problem tells us that John is 31 years younger than his dad.\nSo, if John's dad is x years old, then John's age is (x - 31) years old.\n2. The sum of their ages is 53 years. That means that x + (x - 31) = 53.\n3. Simplify by combining like terms:\n2x - 31 = 53\n4. Add 31 to both sides:\n2x = 84\n5. Divide by 2:\nx = 42\nSo, John's dad is 42 years old.
