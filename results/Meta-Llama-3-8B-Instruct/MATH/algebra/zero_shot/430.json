I hope it is correct. Hide Solution Show Solution ### Logic: First, we need to find the slope of the line. To do this, we use the formula: m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\nThis formula calculates the slope by taking the difference between the y-coordinates and dividing it by the difference between the x-coordinates.\nSubstituting in our given values for x and y, we have:\nm = (6 - (-2)) / (-2 - (-4))\nm = 8/2\nm = 4\nSo the slope is 4. Now that we know the slope, we can write the equation for the line using the point-slope form.\nThe point-slope form for a line is:\ny - y1 = m(x - x1)\nIn this case, the point (x1, y1) is (-2, 6). So we have:\ny - 6 = 4(x - (-2))\nTo simplify this expression, we can FOIL out the right-hand side:\ny - 6 = 4(x + 2)\nThis means that the equation for the line is:\ny = 4x + 8\nNow that we have the equation for the line, we can find the y-coordinate where the line intersects the y-axis. This is when x = 0.\nSo we can substitute 0 for x in the equation:\ny = 4(0) + 8\nThis means:\ny = 8\nSo the y-coordinate where the line intersects the y-axis",
        " \nLet\u2019s find the line between the two points. First, we can find the slope between the two points. We can use the formula $$\\textrm{slope} = \\frac{\\textrm{change in }y}{\\textrm{change in } x}.$$ Since we have two points, we can use the differences between the coordinates to simplify this formula. $$\\textrm{slope} = \\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1} = \\frac{(-2) - 6}{(-4) - (-2)} = \\frac{-8}{-2} = 4.$$ Now we have the slope, let\u2019s write the line in the form $$y=mx+b$$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the $y$-intercept. We know the slope is $4$, and we can find the $y$-intercept using either of the two points. Let\u2019s use $(-2,6)$. We can plug these values into the equation. $$6 = 4(-2) + b \\Rightarrow b = 6 + 8 = 14 \\Rightarrow \\boxed{y = 4x+14}.$$ Now we have the equation of the line. To find where it intersects the $y$-axis, we can set $x=0$. $$y = 4(0) + 14 = 14.$$ Since we\u2019re looking for the $y$-coordinate on the $y$-axis, we know $x=0$, which means the equation we plugged in earlier was correct.

        " \nStep 1: We know that we have a straight line. So, we can find the slope of this line. We have two points $(-2,6)$ and $(-4,-2)$.

We know that the equation of a straight line is `y = mx + b`, where `m` is the slope, `x` is the `$x$`-coordinate, and `b` is the `$y$`-intercept.\nWe don't know the `$y$`-intercept `b`, but we know that the line passes through the points $(-2, 6)$ and $(-4, -2)$. So, we can use either of these points to substitute into `y = mx + b`.\nLet\u2019s use the point `(-2,6)`. Substitute into `y = mx + b`:\n`6 = 4(-2) + b` Subtracting `-2 \\* 4` from both sides:\n`6 = -8 + b` Adding `8` to both sides:\n`14 = b`\nSo, the `$y$`-intercept `b` is `14`.\nStep 3: Now we have all the values: `m = 4` and `b = 14`.

        " The good news is that the slope-intercept form is perfect for this problem. To find the slope, we are asked to use the two points and a slope formula.
