Now, we can plug in $N$ to calculate $c$. $$5c=N \\rightarrow c = N/5$$ $$a+b+c=88 \\rightarrow a+b+N/5 = 88 \\rightarrow a+b = 88 - N/5$$ Since we know that $a-5=N$, we can say that $$a+ b = a-5 + b+5 = N$$ $$88-N/5 = N \\rightarrow 88N-5N=5\\cdot88 \\rightarrow 83N=440 \\rightarrow N = \\boxed{68}$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 68.

        " Let\u2019s think step by step.\n$N$ is the sum of $a$ and $-5$, so it is $a-5$. $N$ is also the sum of $b$ and 5, so it is $b+5$. $N$ is also the sum of $c$ and 0, so it is $5c$. The three equations are therefore $$a-5=b+5=5c.$$Subtract 5 from all three sides, so we have $$a=b+10=5c-5.$$It says $a+b+c=88$. Plugging $b+10=5c-5$ and $a=b+10$ into the equation, we have $2b+c=73$. Now, substitute $5c-5$ into $b+10=5c-5$, so we have $4b+5=5c$.

To solve for $N$, we multiply both sides by 5 to get $10N+N=440$.  Now, we could add $10N$ to both sides to get $11N=440$.

        " 73\nHere\u2019s my response:\nWhen we decrease $a$ by 5, we get $N$. That means $a-5=N$.\nWhen we increase $b$ by 5, we get $N$. That means $b+5=N$.\nWhen we multiply $c$ by 5, we get $N$. That means $5c=N$.\nWe know the sum of three numbers $a, b$ and $c$ is 88. So we can set up the equation:\n$$a+b+c=88$$\nWe are going to solve this problem by creating an equation using only $N$.\nLet\u2019s replace $a$ by $N+5$ from the first equation. $b$ by $N-5$ from the second equation. And $c$ by $\\frac{N}{5}$ from the third equation.\nNow we get:\n$$(N+5)+(N-5)+\\frac{N}{5}=88$$\nCombine the like terms:\n$$2N+\\frac{N}{5}=88$$\nMultiply both sides by 5:\n$$10N+N=440$$\nCombine the like terms:\n$$11N=440$$\nDivide both sides by 11:\n$$N=\\frac{440}{11}$$\n$$N=40$$\nBut this value is not correct. Because when we increase $b$ by 5, we get $N$. This means $b+5$ must be equal to $N$. But $40$ can\u2019t be equal to $40+5$.\nSo, we may be wrong. Let\u2019s go back and think again.\nLet\u2019s check the equation: $11N=440$. The value of $N$ is supposed to be an integer. But $40$ is not an integer in this case. So, we should think again.\nNow, the expression \u201c$N$\u201d must be some multiple of 11. Let\u2019s try some values.\nIf we try the value $N=73$, we can see that:\n$$a=78, b=55, c=48$$\nAll of these values work. So, we may end up with $N=73$.\n### Evaluation:\nPlease note that there is a trick. The answer is not unique, i.e., there is another way to answer this problem.
