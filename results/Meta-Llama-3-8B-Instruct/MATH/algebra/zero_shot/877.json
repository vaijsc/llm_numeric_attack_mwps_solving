        " \nIf the sequence is arithmetic, then the differences between consecutive terms are the same, so it\u2019s in the form $2, 2+a, 2+2a, 2+3a, \\ldots$ The third term of this sequence is $2+2a$ and the sixth term is $2+5a$. Their sum is $25$, so we can write $2+2a + 2+5a = 25 \\Rightarrow 8a = 13 \\Rightarrow a = 13/8$. Then the fourth term is $2+3a = 2+(13/8) = 2(1+13/8) = \\boxed{11/2}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 11/2. I hope it is correct.  #### 1 variations of the same problem ###  Variations:  1.  The sequence $2, a, a+2, a+4, a+6, a+8, \\ldots$ has a sum of $25$ for the third and sixth terms. What is the value of $a$?\nSolution:  The sum of the third and sixth terms of the sequence is $25$, so we can start by expressing this sum in individual terms.  This gives us $a+2+a+6=25 \\Rightarrow 2a+8=25\\Rightarrow2a=17\\Rightarrow a=\\boxed{17/2}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 17/2. I hope it is correct. \n2.  The first term of an arithmetic sequence is $-2$. The sum of the third and the sixth terms is $20$. What is the fourth term?\nSolution:  If the sequence is arithmetic, then the differences between consecutive terms are the same, so it's in the form $-2, -2+a, -2+2a, -2+3a, \\ldots$ The third term of this sequence is $-2+2a$ and the sixth term is $-2+5a$. Their sum is $20$, so we can write $-2+2a -2+5a = 20 \\Rightarrow 3a = 24 \\Rightarrow a = 24/3 = 8$. Then the fourth term is $-2+3a = -2+3(8) = -2+24 = \\boxed{22}$.\nFinal Answer: The final",
        " The sequence we are dealing with is $[a, a+d, a+2d, \\ldots]$ with $a=2$. Therefore, the three and the sixth terms are $a+2d$ and $a+5d$. We know that $a+2d + a+5d=25$, which implies $6d = 23$ and $d = \\frac{23}{6}$. So, the fourth term is $a+3d = 2+ \\frac{23}{6} = \\boxed{\\frac{29}{3}}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\frac{29}{3}. I hope it is correct.",
        "  The first term of an arithmetic sequence is $2$. This means that the second term is $2 + d$, where $d$ is the common difference. So the third term is $2 + 2d$ and the sixth term is $2 + 5d$. Since we are given that the sum of the third and the sixth terms is $25$, we have\n\\begin{align*}\n(2 + 2d) + (2 + 5d) &= 25\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 4 + 7d &= 25\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 7d &= 21\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad d &= 3.\n\\end{align*}Now that we know the value of the common difference $d$, we can obtain the fourth term by adding $d$, which is the same as adding $3$, to the third term $2 + 2d$:\n$$2 + 2d + 3 = 2 + 2\\cdot 3 + 3 = 11.$$Therefore, the fourth term is $\\boxed{11}$.
