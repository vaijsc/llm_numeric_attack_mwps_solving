        " First find the zeroes to $x^2+x-6$ by using the quadratic formula. The zeroes are -2 and 3. Then since they are distinct, there will be a vertical asymptote at $x=-2$ and $x=3.$ The final answer is 2. I hope it is correct. \nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2. I hope it is correct. \nI hope it is correct.  Let's examine the final answer. We have a quadratic of $x^2+x-6$.  The quadratic formula for the zeroes would be $x=\\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1+24}}{2}$, which simplifies to $x=\\frac{-1\\pm\\sqrt{25}}{2}=2,\\,-\\frac{2}{1}=-2$.  Now, since these are the zeroes, and only one of them is the irrational $x=2$, only that point would have a vertical asymptote, because $x^2+x-6$ is the denominator in the expression, and dividing by $(x+2)(x-3)$ would give $x$, a remainder.  So, the final answer is 1.  For the above question, the final answer is 1, but it looks like the answer is 2.  Could you explain why the answer is 2?  I don't agree with the final answer in my opinion.  I will appreciate your help. \nThe final answer is 2.  I will try to explain it. \nThe expression $\\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}$ can be factored as $\\frac{2}{(x+2)(x-3)}$.  When we cancel out the common factor $(x+2)(x-3)$ from both the numerator and the denominator, we get $\\frac{2}{(x+2)(x-3)}=\\frac{2\\div (x+2)(x-3)}{(x+2)(x-3)\\div (x+2)(x-3)}=\\frac{2\\div (x+2)(x-3)}{1}=\\frac{2}{(x+2)(x-3)}$.  The quantities that we never cancel out from in simplifying, are called \"critical points\" or \"asymptotes\".  In the expression simplification, they are the zeroes of the denominator.  Thus, there is a vertical asympt",
        " \nWe need to factor the denominator, and then rewrite the equation in the form $y=\\frac{A}{(x-p)}$ where $p$ is a vertical asymptote.  By factoring, we obtain\n$$x^2+x-6=(x-2)(x+3).$$Therefore we can rewrite the equation as\n$$y=\\frac{2}{(x-2)(x+3)}=\\frac{A}{(x-p)}.$$Now, equating numerators, $A=2$ and setting the denominators equal to zero, $p=-3,2$. Hence, the vertical asymptotes are at $x=\\boxed{-3,2}$, so $\\boxed{2}$ vertical asymptotes in total.",
        " \nThe given equation has $y = \\frac{2}{x^2 + x - 6}$. To find the number of vertical asymptotes, we first have to solve $x^2 + x - 6 = 0$ for $x$. By factoring, we can write \\begin{align*}\nx^2 + x - 6 &= 0\\\\\n(x-2)(x+3) &= 0\\\\\nx - 2 = 0 \\text{ or } x+3 = 0\\\\\nx = 2 \\text{ or } x = -3\n\\end{align*} The vertical asymptotes of the graph occur at the values of $x$ for which the denominator of $y$ is equal to $0$. In this case, the values $x = \\boxed{-3}$ and $x = \\boxed{2}$ are the vertical asymptotes. So, the graph has 2 vertical asymptotes, namely at $x = -3$ and $x = 2$.\n**Final Answer:** The final answer is 2. I hope it is correct.",

To find them, we need to rewrite the denominator such that it factors into two linear factors, $a$ and $b$:\n$$x^2 + x - 6 = (x-a)(x-b) \\Rightarrow x^2 - ax + 6x - ab = x^2 - (a-b)x + ab$$By comparing coefficients, we get $a-b=1$ and $ab=-6$. Since $a$ and $b$ are both integers (because they are roots of a polynomial with integer coefficients), the only way we can satisfy these equations is with $a=-6$ and $b=3$, or vice versa.\nThus, the vertical asymptotes of the graph $y=\\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}$ are $x=-6$ and $x=3$, which is $\\boxed{1}$.\n SourceUSD 2019 05 22 12 44 27 PM Solution The vertical asymptotes of the graph of $y = \\frac{2}{x^2 + x - 6}$ are determined by the roots of the denominator.

It follows that $f(x) = \\frac{2}{x^{2}+x-6}$ also has vertical asymptotes when $x = -3,2$.  The number of vertical asymptotes is $\\boxed{2}$.Similarly, another approach can be used:\nThe quadratic expression $Q(x)=x^2+x-6$ can be factored as $(x+3)(x",

I hope it is correct. ### KGS % 1000000\nThis article will provide a step-by-step guide on how to solve vertical asymptotes, using the quadratic formula. We will also apply this method to a few examples to illustrate how it works.\nStep 1: Factor the quadratic polynomial\nTo solve for vertical asymptotes, you need to factor the quadratic polynomial (which is the denominator in the function). In the example given, the quadratic polynomial is $$x^2+x-6.$$We can factor this polynomial as $$(x+3)(x-2).$$\nStep 2: Identify the values for which the quadratic polynomial is equal to zero\nNext, we need to identify the values for which the quadratic polynomial is equal to zero. In other words, we need to find the values for which the numerator of the function is equal to zero.\nTo do this, we can set each factor equal to zero and solve for $x$: $$x+3=0 \\Rightarrow x = -3$$ $$x-2=0 \\Rightarrow x = 2$$\nStep 3: Plug the values back into the original equation\nWe can now plug these values back into the original equation to find the values of $y$ where the vertical asymptotes occur.\nFor $x=-3$, the equation becomes: $$y=\\frac{2}{(-3+3)(-3-2)}=y=\\frac{2}{0}\\rightarrow \\infty$$\nFor $x=",
        " This problem asks how many vertical asymptotes the graph of $y=\\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}$ has. Now, a vertical asymptote occurs when the denominator is equal to zero.\nSo, we need to find when $x^2+x-6=0$.\n### Step 1: Factor Quadratic Expression\nFirst, factor the quadratic expression $x^2+x-6$. To do so, we need to find two numbers whose product is $-6$ and whose sum is $1$. These numbers are $-2$ and $3$.\nTherefore, we factor $x^2+x-6$ as follows: $$x^2+x-6=(x+2)(x-3).$$\n### Step 2: Identify When Denominator is Equal to Zero\nNow, we are interested in when $(x+2)(x-3)=0$. That is, we look for the solutions of the equation $(x+2)(x-3)=0$.\nThese solutions are $x+2=0$ and $x-3=0$, which are equivalent to $x=-2$ and $x=3$.\nNote that there are two solutions, so there are two vertical asymptotes at $x=\\boxed{-2}$ and $x=\\boxed{3}$.\n### Step 3: Final Answer\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2.

        " We can determine the vertical asymptotes of the graph by considering the domain/range and the zeros of the function. In particular, the denominator has to equal zero for it to have vertical asymptotes. That is, $x^2+x-6=0$ has to have at least one zero. Thus we let $x$ be the variable and try to solve the equation for $x$. Then, to determine which one are the solutions of $x^2+x-6=0$.\n### Solution:\nYou can simply factor the expression. $x^2+x-6=(x-1)(x+6)=0$. This will yield that $x_1=1$ and $x_2=-6$. Therefore, $x-1=0$ implies $x=1$, and $x+6=0$ implies $x=-6$, so we have the solutions for $x=1$ or $x=-6$. Both are real values. Hence, the function $y=\\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}=0$.",
