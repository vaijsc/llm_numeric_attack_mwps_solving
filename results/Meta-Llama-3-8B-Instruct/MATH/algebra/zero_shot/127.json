Therefore, we have the exact opposite situation that $8$ is a power less than $4^2=16$.\nTherefore, we need to find the power $k$ such that $4^k\\leq8$, since we can express $8$ as $4^3=(4^1)^31=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}$.\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}$.\n### End of Solution\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\frac{3}{2}.

        " \nWe have to find the power of 4 that gives us 8. This means the power of 2 that gives us 4. This power is 2, so 4^2 gives us 4, not 8, which is still smaller. So the power must be larger.

The immediate remedy for such questions is to reduce the problem into easier one and solve it. Here, we are given 8. If you divide 8 by 4 you get 2. Therefore, we can conclude that $4^2=8$ and the answer is 2. Now, in order to make it a common fraction we can write it as $\\frac{2}{1}$. Thus, we have solved the question.\nIf you are still struggling, you can look at the generalization part which provides a step-by-step solution.

        " We know that $4^2=16$, so the first power of 4 that yields an integer greater than 8 is 3. So, is the 4th power a solution? $4^3=64$, which is indeed greater than 8. Thus, we want to know what power of 4 yields 8. So, we must have $4^n=8$, for some positive integer $n$. From here, we can solve this problem using various means, such as trial-and-error or polynomial long division. A far more elegant method is to see that $4^2=16$ and $4^3=64$, so it might be worth noting that $4^2=4\\cdot 4=2\\cdot 16$, so this is a power of 4. Furthermore, we can add the conclusion: $16\\cdot 4=8\\cdot 4^2=8\\cdot 4\\cdot 4$. From here, we can see that the power $n$ is just 2.

        " $2^3 = 8$. Hence, $$\\boxed{2^3/2^2=4/4=1}$$\n### So 2^3 = 8. We can then write 2^3 in terms of 2^2. $$1 \\cdot (2^2)^1 = 2^3$$\nNow, we are told to express this as a common fraction. So, we will express it like this.\n$$\\frac{(2^2)^1}{1} = 2^3$$\n### Next, we have to find a common power of 4 equal to 8. We saw earlier that $2^3 = 8.$ Therefore, the power of 4 we want is $2^2.$ The power of 2 does not matter since we are looking at the power of 4, so $2^2$ or $3^2$ will work for our desired power. Here is what we have now:\n$$\\frac{(2^2)^1}{1} = 4^2$$\n### In the equation above, we notice that we have multiplied 2^2 to itself 1 time and not divided by 1, so to continue on the equation we write $(2^2)^1$ or $2^2$.

So, 4^2 < 8.\n4^3 = 64;\n64 > 8.\n### Answer: It seems like we have no power of 4 equivalent to 8. In this instance, we may use mathematical expressions instead of real numbers. Allow us to use mathematical expressions. Then we can make sense to count energy.\nFrom there, it could be concluded that there is no power of 4 which is equal to 8. You can substitute 8 for 4^whatever expression allows you to represent 8 in terms of four. Final Answer: The final response is, and it is considered correct. I hope it is helpful. As a result, it is not possible to express 8 as a power of 4.\nIt is not so difficult to understand the Inexact Solution if the topic is presented in a rational context. Therefore, the answer is that there is no power of 4 that is equal to 8.
