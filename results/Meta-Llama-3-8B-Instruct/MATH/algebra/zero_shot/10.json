        " Hi there!  Let's break it down together.  We have been given the functions $f(x)=7x+5$ and $g(x)=x-1$.  We need to determine what the function $h(x)$ is defined as.  We can define $h(x)$ by substituting $g(x)$ into $f(x)$.  According to this definition,\n\\begin{align*}\nh(x)&=f(g(x))\\\\\n&=f(x-1)\\\\\n&=7(x-1)+5=7x+2.\n\\end{align*}\n$$h(x)=7x+2.$$Given this function, we want to find its inverse.  To do this, we can first define the function $h^{-1}(x)$.\nLet's define, in terms of $x$, the function $h^{-1}(x)$ as follows:\n\\begin{align*}\nh^{-1}(x) &= y,\\\\\nh(y) &= x.\n\\end{align*}\nWe now want to express $y$ in terms of $x$.  We can do this by rewriting $h(y)$, as we have it defined above:\n\\begin{align*}\n7y+2 &= x,\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 7y &= x-2,\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad y &= \\frac{x-2}{7}.\n\\end{align*}\n$$h^{-1}(x)=\\frac{x-2}{7}.$$That is, we have shown that the inverse of $h(x)$ is $h^{-1}(x)$, with domain $\\mathbb{R}$ and range $\\mathbb{R}^-$. We have thus found the answer, but we should be warned that it is not a monotone function, to wit: its graph is as shown below.\nThis is the function we want.  How do you like this? Do you need anything else?\nLet me know please.\n### Solution Here: ",
        " We have\n\\begin{align*}\nf(g(x))&=f(x-1)=7(x-1)+5=7x+2.\n\\end{align*}\nNow we must solve for $x$ in terms of $y$ (where $y=h(x)$).
