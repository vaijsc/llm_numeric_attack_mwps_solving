I hope it is correct. One of the important things you\u2019ll notice when you\u2019re working with rationalizing denominators is that you never end up with a surd (irrational number) in the denominator. Here\u2019s why: when you multiply a surd by its conjugate, the surd in the denominator gets cancelled, and you\u2019re left with a simplified rational fraction. This ensures that the denominator will never have a surd, so the fraction will always be in its simplest form. That\u2019s helpful to know when you are working with rationalizing denominators. 3125/3 of our problems with rationalizing denominators are shortened even more because we can notice that the sum under the square root is a perfect square. So in rationalizing denominators, if you notice a perfect square under the square root, you can simplify the expression all the way down to the square root of the perfect square. This will simplify your fraction so it's easier to compare to other options, as we did in our example. 6561/5 stars, only because it's a long one. But, hey, math is all about the details, so let's review what we did. We were started with a decent, but not perfect practice problem. We have a surd under the square root and a fraction. We used the trick of multiplying the numerator and denominator of the fraction by the conjugate of the denominator. That means multiplying it by the surd conjugate. This is what we did: surd/surds conjugate. In our case, the denominator is surd/surds conjugate is \u221a2",
