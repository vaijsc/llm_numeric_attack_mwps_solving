To solve this problem we can use the quadratic formula, which for a quadratic equation in the form of $ax^2+bx+c$ is $\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$. We have $x = \\frac{-10\\pm \\sqrt{10^2-4(1)(k+k)}}{2(1)}$ $x = -5 \\pm \\sqrt{25-4k-4k}$ Since the expression within the square root must be positive and rational, we need that $25 - 4k - 4k = 4k^2 - 16k + 25 = (2k - 5)^2$. This implies that $2k - 5$ is either $0$ or a rational",
        " Since this quadratic has rational coefficients, we know that if its solutions are rational then they would be of the form $\\frac{p}{q}$ (for integers $p, q$ with $q \\ne 0$).

This will happen precisely when\n$$\\left(qx+\\frac{5}{2}\\right)^2-\\frac{25}{4}+k=0 \\Rightarrow k = \\frac{25}{4}-\\left(qx+\\frac{5}{2}\\right)^2,$$ so that $k$ is a rational number.

In our case, we have $a=k$, $b=10$ and $c=k$, so the discriminant is $\\Delta=100-4k^2$.

The number of positive integer solutions of $y^2=x+5$ is 2.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2. I hope it is correct. :). I hope it is correct.

        " For this question, we should consider the answer choices first, as there are only a few possible answers that can come from our calculation.\nIf there had been more than two choices, I would not answer the multiple-choice question in this way.

        " \n$kx^2+10x+k=0$ can be rewritten as $x^2+\\frac{10}{k}x+1=0$.  We know that this equation must have rational solutions if and only if the discriminant $\\Delta=\\left(\\frac{10}{k}\\right)^2-4(1)=\\frac{100}{k^2}-4$ is a perfect square.  Since $\\frac{100}{k^2}$ is an integer, we can try to manipulate it to make it equal to $4n^2$ for some integer $n$.\n$\\begin{array}{ll} \\frac{100}{k^2}&=25\\frac{k^2}{k^2}\\\\ &=25\\left(\\frac{k}{5}\\right)^2=25n^2\\\\ k^2&=5^2n^2, \\end{array}$which is the same as $k=5n$, where $n$ is an integer.  Since we assume that $k$ is a positive integer, it is clear that there is only one possible solution for $k$.  The final answer is 1. I hope it is correct.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 1.

        "  We observe that if $x$ is a root of the quadratic equation, then $x=-5\\pm \\sqrt{25-k},$ and the square root is rational if and only if $25-k$ is the square of some integer. The square root is irrational if and only if $25-k$ is not the square of some integer. We list, for some $k$, the final digit of $25-k$ (this will help us determine whether it is the square of some integer).\n\u2022 $k=1$: $25-1=24$, no power of $2$.\n\u2022 $k=2$: $25-2=23$, no power of $2$.\n\u2022 $k=3$: $25-3=22$, $2^2\\cdot11$.\n\u2022 $k=4$: $25-4=21$, $3^2\\cdot7$.\n\u2022 $k=5$: $25-5=20$, $2^2\\cdot5$.\n\u2022 $k=6$: $25-6=19$, $3\\cdot7$ (do not forget about an integer root).\n\u2022 $k=7$: $25-7=18$, $6^2$.\n\u2022 $k=8$: $25-8=17$, $4^2\\cdot2+1$.\n\u2022 $k=9$: $25-9=16$, $4^2$.\n\u2022 $k=10$: $25-10=15$, $5^2$.\nAt this point, we note that the sequence $5,4,3,2$ is repeated in the sequence of $k$ values.  We can find the next terms of this sequence: $k=11,12,13,14.$ Similarly, we find $k=15,16,...$. This sequence continues indefinitely. Since we end up back at the beginning after every $4$ numbers (or powers of $2$), we know that there are $4$ rational solutions to the quadratic equation whenever $k$ ends with $1$, $4$, $7$, or $9$ (since these numbers are the squares of integers).  Since there are four of these, there are $\\boxed{4}$ positive integer values of $k$ such that the quadratic equation has rational solutions.\n### Alternate Solution with the same result: \nSuppose that $k$ is the difference of two perfect squares $k=a^2-b^2",
        " A quadratic equation with rational solutions means that the quadratic has rational roots, or that its discriminant $\\Delta$ is a perfect square, that is:\n$$\\Delta=b^2-4ac$$where $b$ denotes the coefficient of $x$, $a$ denotes the coefficient of $x^2$, and $c$ denotes the constant. In our case, the quadratic is $kx^2+10x+k=0,$ so that $a=k$, $b=10,$ and $c=k.$ Therefore, we have\n\\begin{align*}\n\\Delta&=10^2-4k^2(k)\\\\\n&=100-4k^3\n\\end{align*}Thus, the quadratic equation has rational solutions when $\\Delta=c^2$ is a perfect square for some $c.$ We have\n\\begin{align*}\n100-4k^3&=c^2\\\\\n&=(d)^2\\\\\n\\iff\\qquad c&=d, \\;\\;d\\in\\mathbb{Z}.\n\\end{align*}AT this point, we need to require that $d$ is divisible by $10$, that is, the square roots of $100$ are multiples of $10$. The square roots of $100$ are $\\pm10$, and we know that $10$ and $-10$ are divisible by $10$. So we can require that $d=\\pm10$. Thus, the equation will have rational solutions if $k$ satisfies any of the following conditions:\n\\begin{align*}\n&100-4k^3=\\left(10\\right)^2\\Rightarrow\\boxed{k=\\pm\\frac{9}{4}},\\\\\n&\\Rightarrow\\boxed{k=\\pm\\frac{9}{4}}.\n\\end{align*}\nWe have found $4$ different positive integer values of $k$ which satisfy the given condition, namely $\\boxed{k=1, \\; k=2, \\; k=3,}$ and $\\boxed{k=9}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 4.

        " 1.\nWe have $kx^2+10x+k=0$. Since $x$ is a rational solution, it can be expressed as $\\frac{p}{q}$ for some integers $p$ and $q$ such that $q\\neq0$.\n\\begin{align*}\nk\\left(\\frac{p}{q}\\right)^2+10\\left(\\frac{p}{q}\\right)+k&=0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad k\\frac{p^2}{q^2}+10\\frac{p}{q}+k&=0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\quad k\\frac{p^2}{q^2}+\\frac{10kp}{q}+k&=0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\quad\\frac{k(p^2+10p+q^2)}{q^2}&=0\n\\end{align*}Since $\\frac{k(p^2+10p+q^2)}{q^2}$ is equal to 0, we must have  $k(p^2+10p+q^2)=0$.\nFor this to be true, we know either $k=0$ and $(p^2+10p+q^2)\\neq 0$ (which implies $p^2+10p+q^2$ is not a multiple of $q^2$), or $(p^2+10p+q^2)=0$ and $k\\neq 0$.\nFor the first case, we have $k=0$, and $p^2+10p+q^2\\neq 0$, so we can assume that $k=0$, giving $p^2+10p+q^2\\neq 0$.\nFor the second case, we have $(p^2+10p+q^2)=0$.  Since $p^2+10p+q^2=(p+5)^2-q^2$, this simplifies to $(p+5)^2=q^2$, meaning $p+5=\\pm q$.  Since $p$ and $q$ are integers, this implies $q$ is an integer factor of $p+5$, and $p$ can be expressed as $q^2-(p+5)$ for some integer $q$.  Furthermore, it is possible to proceed to express $p$ as a",
        " Often these types of problems are a little easier to tackle with a more concrete example, let's consider this problem for $k = 1$. Then we have equation $$ x^2 +10x+1 = 0.$$ Let\u2019s solve the equation in the following steps:",
        "  Let $x$ be a rational number and $k$ a positive integer.\nSince $x$ is rational, $x=p/q$ for some positive integers $p$ and $q$. $p$ and $q$ are coprime, and $$\\frac{p^2+10pq+p q^2 + 10 p + 10 q + q^2}{q^2} = 0.$$ $$p^2+10pq+p q^2 + 10 p + 10 q + q^2 = 0$$ $$p^2+10pq+p q^2 + 10 p + 10 q + q^2 = 0$$ $$q^2 p^2+10 pq q^2+q^4 + 10 p q + 10 q + q^2 = 0$$ $$(q^2 p+q)(q^2 p+q+10) = 0$$\n### Case1:\u00a0 $q^2 p = -q$\n$p = -1/q^2$. But then $$q^2 + 10 q - q = 0$$ $$q^2 + 10 q = q$$ $$q^2 + 10 q = q$$ $$q^2 + 9 q = 0$$ $q = 0$, which means that $x = \\frac{p}{q} = 0$, contradiction.\n### Case2:\u00a0 $q^2 p + q = 0$\n$p = -1/q$. But then $$q^2 - 10 q - q = 0$$ $$q^2 - 9 q = 0$$ $$q(q-9) = 0$$ $q = 0$ or $q = 9$.\n### Case1:\u00a0 $q = 0$\n$x = \\frac{p}{0}$. But then $p = 0$. As we are looking for positive integer values of $x$, this can\u2019t happen. Thus, we omit this case.\n### 3.1:\u00a0 $q = 9$\n$x = \\frac{-1}{9}$. $k = 1/9$, and $\\frac{-1}{9}$ is rational. In conclusion, when $q=9$, we have one positive integer value for $k$.\n### Conclusion:\nIn summary, we found one positive integer value of $k$ such that $kx^2+10x+k",
        " \nLet $f(x)=kx^2+10x+k.$ We wish to find the number of positive integer values of k such that the equation f(x)=0 has rational solutions. Since f is a quadratic, the equation will have rational solutions if and only if its discriminant $\\Delta$ is a square.\nWe have$$\\Delta=100-4(k^2).$$Since 100 is a perfect square, and $k$ is an integer, we want to find the number of positive integers k such that $-4(k^2)$ is an integer and is the square of an integer.\nThe form $4k^2$ is a product of two perfect squares if and only if both k and 4k^2 are perfect squares. For a given positive integer k, the value 4k^2 is a perfect square precisely if k^2 is a perfect square. Therefore, k is a perfect square if and only if $\\Delta$ is a perfect square.\nThe perfect squares less than 100 are $1,4,9,16,25,\\dots$, and the corresponding values of k are$$1,2,3,2,1,\\dots.$$So, there are 5 values of k for which f(x)=0 has rational solutions.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 5.
