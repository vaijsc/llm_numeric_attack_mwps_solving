        " First, we know that the common ratio of the geometric sequence $6,a,b$ is $\\frac{a}{6}=\\frac{b}{a}$. We can write $b=ar/6$ for some constant $r$. Next, the common ratio of the geometric sequence $\\frac{1}{b},a,54$ is $54/a=\\frac{a}{1/b}=\\frac{ab}{1}$. We can write $ab=54$ for some constant $r$.  Now, $r=a/\\left(6a\\right)$, and we can write $ab=54$ as $a\\left(\\frac{ar}{6}\\right)=54$, giving $a^2r/6=54$, and $ar=a^2r=324$, and $r=324/a$. Then, we can write the common ratio of the geometric sequence $\\frac{1}{b},a,54$ as $54/a=\\frac{a}{1/\\left(a/6\\right)}=\\frac{a}{a/6}=6$. So, we obtain $54=6a$, and $a=9$.

        " Hi!\nFor the first sequence 6, a, b, the common ratio is $\\frac{a}{6}$. We can rewrite the sequence as 6, 6r, 6r^2, where r = $\\frac{a}{6}$. Since we know one term, we can solve for r and then plug it back in to find the other terms.\nSimilarly, for the second sequence $\\frac{1}{b}, a, 54$ the common ratio is $\\frac{a}{\\frac{1}{b}}$. We can rewrite the sequence as $\\frac{1}{b}, \\frac{b}{1}, 54$ = $\\frac{1}{b}, b, 54b$. Since we know one term, we can solve for the common ratio r = $\\frac{b}{1} = b$.\nComparing the two sequences, we can see that r = $\\frac{a}{6}$ and r = b, we can set them equal to each other.\n$\\frac{a}{6}$ = b.\nNow we have two values for b, we can substitute them to find a.\nWe have a = 6b, and $\\frac{1}{b}$ = b.\nFrom here we can solve for b and then find a.\nIf you want me to continue, I can do so!",

        " \nFirst, notice that $a$ and $b$ are between 6 and 54 (since $a$ is somewhere in the geometric sequence $6,a,b$, and $b$ is the next term in the same sequence). So we can just look at the pattern for the sequence $6,a,b$ and the pattern for the sequence $\\frac{1}{b},a,54$:\n$$\\frac{a}{6}=r$$ where $r$ is a constant.\n$$\\frac{b}{a}=r$$\n$$r=\\sqrt{\\frac{6}{a}}$$\n$$a=r\\cdot 6$$\n$a=\\sqrt{\\frac{6}{a}}6\\implies6a=a^{3/2}\\implies a^2=6a\\implies {a^2-a=0}\\implies {a(a-1)=0}$ Now, since $a$ is a real number, we can conclude that $a=0$ or $a=1$. But since $a$ is a geometric sequence of positive real numbers, we must disregard the first option and conclude that $a=\\boxed{1}$.\nThis means that $b=\\boxed{6}$.\nNow, we can plug $a=1$ and $b=6$ into the pattern for the sequence $\\frac{1}{b},a,54$:\n$$\\frac{\\frac{1}{6}}{54}=\\frac{1}{54}$$\n$$\\frac{1}{b}=54r$$\n$$54r=\\frac{1}{6}\\implies r=\\frac{1}{54\\cdot 6}$$\nThus, the solution is a=1 and b=6, which are the next terms in the sequence 6, a, b after 6. Then, the next terms in the sequence $\\frac{1}{b},a,54$ after $\\frac{1}{b}$ are a and 54, since the ratio of the terms must remain constant.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is a=1 and b=6.
