Have a great day! \u2013 Stan Broughton Stan Broughton #### Stan Broughton (Stan Broughton) May you get what you need. Have a great day!  Supplementary information What is this? Arithmetric series! This might be a solution for an Arithmetic progression. What is a series? A series is a list of numbers that adds up using certain rules. Mathematical series likes 1+2+3+4+... and \u222b and infinite limits are also other examples. An arithmetic sequence is a series of numbers where each term is produced by adding a constant to the previous term. then it will create an arithmetic sequence. Example: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on. How would you determine whether a set of numbers is an arithmetic sequence? Is there a formula to determine whether it\u2019s an arithmetic sequence? Here are some rules for you to determine whether it is an arithmetic sequence:\n* The difference between two sequential terms is always the same. simply put,\n(An\u2212 1) - An = (An +1) - An+1\n(For instance, to verify the series: 5, 7, 9, 11, ...).\nDo you want more information on this topic?

        " Let\u2019s start by putting a and b into the given formula:\nNow we have the following: lcm we can rewrite it as squaring it, and using some other formulas for these expressions. But since this is too extend, so we need to leave the expression as it is. After that, we can directly simplify this and write as a common fraction.\nGiven the expression, we know that any two numbers $a$ and $b$ are present. We see in the expression of $a$ and $b$ and the given formula $3$ and $11$.\n### Calculation: We do the work simply.\nNow, we have.\n$3 \\star 11 = \\dfrac{\\left(\\dfrac{1}{11} - \\dfrac{1}{3}\\right)}{(3 - 11)}$\nIn this equation, simplify each part of the equation.

Now we just need to replace $a$ with $3$ and $b$ with $11$ to find out $3 \\star 11$.\nIn simplifying the expression, we see that the power of the division cannot be distributed as usually when we are not dividing fractions by fractions. Now you see that the common denominator of these two fractions ought to be negative in the case-of addition because ratios add indices with over the denominator.\n$3 \\star 11 = \\dfrac{\\left(\\dfrac{1}{11} - \\dfrac{1}{3}\\right)}{(3 - 11)}$\n$3 \\star 11 = \\dfrac{\\left(\\dfrac{11 - 3}{33}\\right)}{(-8)}$\nAnd since division is understood as the inverse operation of multiplication, we\u2019re ready for our final step.
