        " S\nWe recall that perpendicular lines have slopes that are negative reciprocals of each other.  That is to say, if $m_1$ is the slope of one line and $m_2$ is the slope of the other, $$m_1 m_2 = -1.$$Suppose the slope of the line that we know is $m_1$.  Then since the slope of the line through $(-1,2)$ and $(1,-2)$ is given by $\\displaystyle m_1 = \\frac{-2-2}{1-(-1)} = \\frac{-4}{2}=-2,$ the slope of a perpendicular line will be $\\frac{1}{2}.$ That is the final answer.\nYou can also solve the problem using the formula $$m = \\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}.$$This formula is the slope of the line through the points $$(x_1,y_1) \\textrm{ and } (x_2,y_2)$$ which in this case are the two given points. Using the given points $(-1,2)$ and $(1,-2)$ into the formula gives the slope as $m_1 = \\frac{-2-2}{1-(-1)} = \\frac{-4}{2}=-2$, same result as what we used to identify $m_1$ above.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\frac{1}{2}.

Instead, consider using the point-slope form of a line, which is y - y_1 = m(x - x_1). With this form, you can easily find the slope of the perpendicular line, since the slopes of perpendicular lines have an inverse relationship. (That is, if one line has slope m, its perpendicular line has slope -1/m.)\n### Answer: For the response to be valid, we must show that the line has a known slope. So, we may proceed as follows:\nRecall that the equation is -2x + b = 2.  By adding $2$ to both sides, we obtain -2x + b = 2 + 2.\nSimplifying, we get -2x + b = 4. Subtracting $b$ to both sides, we obtain -2x = 4 - b. Dividing both sides by -2, we obtain $\\frac{-2x}{-2}=\\frac{4}{-2}-\\frac{b}{-2}.$ Since $\\frac{-2x}{-2}$ equals $x$, we get $x = \\frac{4-b}{-2}$.  Plugging these values into x = y - mx, we find that y = -2x + b.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -\\frac{1}{2}. I hope it is correct. || ||\n|| ",
