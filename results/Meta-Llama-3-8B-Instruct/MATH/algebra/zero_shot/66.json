In general, minimization problems like this require calculus, but one optimization method that sometimes works is to try to complete the square.  Pulling out a factor of $\\frac{1}{4}$ from under the radical, we have \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{4x^2+x^4-36x^2+324}&=\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{(x^4-32x^2+256)+68} \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{(x^2-16)^2+68}\n\\end{align*}This last expression is minimized when the square equals $0$, that is, when $x^2=16$.

        " 1. We have to use the fact that the distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is |x2-x1| * sqrt(1+(y2-y1)^2). We want to find the shortest distance from the origin to the point on the graph of y = (1/2) x^2 \u2013 9. The origin is (0, 0) and the point on the graph is (x, y = (1/2) x^2 \u2013 9). 2. Since y = (1/2) x^2 \u2013 9, then we can say x^2 = 2y + 18. 3. We want to find the point on the graph that is closest to the origin. So we want to find the minimum value of (x \u2013 0)^2 + (y \u2013 0)^2. Using x^2 = 2y + 18, y = 0.5x^2 \u2013 9, we have (x \u2013 0)^2 + (y \u2013 0)^2 = x^2 + 0.5x^2 \u2013 9. Now, replace x^2 with 2y + 18, we get x^2 + 0.5x^2 \u2013 9 = 1.5x^2 \u2013 9. 4. Now we can find the minimum value of 1.5x^2 \u2013 9. Take the derivative of 1.5x^2 \u2013 9, we get 3x. To find the minimum value, we set the derivative equal to 0, we get 3x = 0, x = 0. 5. So the closest point to the origin is (0, y = 0.5*(0)^2 \u2013 9) = (0, -9). Now we can use the distance formula to find the shortest distance. The distance equation is |x2-x1| * sqrt(1+(y2-y1)^2). In our case, x1 = 0, y1 = 0, x2 = 0, y2 = -9. 6.

The origin is $3$ units from the vertex, and the point on the curve farthest from the origin is $(6, 0)$.  The closest points to the origin are also on the curve, with one at $(0, -9)$.  The distance from the origin to $x=0$ is $\\boxed{3^2=9}$.\nThe other distance we need is to the point at $x=-6$.  We can find this distance by substituting in $x=-6$ with $y=49$, which is the value for the point, and then taking the square root of the sum of the squares of the values of $x$ and $y$.  Doing this, we get $\\sqrt{(6^2)+(49)}=\\sqrt{113}$.\nFrom here, we can show that the point on the curve nearest the origin is the one at the vertex of the quadratic, so the shortest distance to this point will be the sum of the shortest distance to the origin and the vertical distance between the origin and the vertex.  This we know to be $3$.  Therefore, we start testing for the distance from $x=0$ using the equation for a parabola in vertex form and solving for $y$.\nNow, the point on the curve is given by $y=\\frac{1}{2}x^2-9$.

In other words, we must have $\\frac{1}{2}x^2=9$, which implies that $x^2=18$ and $x= \\pm\\sqrt{18}.$  The origin is at $(0,0)$, so we want to find the distance between $(0,0)$ and $(\\sqrt{18},9).$  We can do that by finding the distance between $(0,0)$ and $(\\sqrt{18},9)$ by using distance formula:\n$$\\sqrt{(\\sqrt{18})^2 + 9^2}$$\nNow we simplify and take square root of both sides.\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\sqrt{18+81}\\\\\n=\\quad&\\sqrt{99}\\\\\n=\\quad&9\\sqrt{11}\n\\end{align*}\nSquare that we have an answer to find $a^2$.\n$$9\\sqrt{11} = \\boxed{99}$$\n### Final Answer:\nFinal Answer is 99. I hope it is correct.

(To be continued)\nLet\u2019s think step by step.\u00a0The smallest distance between the origin and a point on the graph of $y=\\frac{1}{2}x^2-9$ can be expressed as $a$.\u00a0Find $a^2$.\n1. The $y$-intercept of $y=\\frac{1}{2}x^2-9$ is $(-0, -9)$.\u00a0The distance of the point from the origin $(0, 0)$ is $\\sqrt{0 + (-9)^2} = \\sqrt{81} = 9$.\n2.
