    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The sixth term is exactly halfway between the fourth and the eighth in the arithmetic sequence, so it is the average of the two terms. Therefore, the sixth term is $(200 + 500)/2 = \\boxed{350}$.  We also could have found the common difference by noting that there are four steps between the fourth term and the eighth term.  So, if $d$ is the common difference, we have $4d = 500-200 = 300$. Therefore, we find $d=75$.  The sixth term is two steps after the fourth, or $200 + 2d = \\boxed{350}$.",

        " Let\u2019s begin by defining the arithmetic sequence from the first term to the fourth term as follows:\n$$a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d, a+4d$$ Since the fourth term is 200, we have:\n$$a+4d=200 \\implies a+4d-200=0 \\implies (a+4d-200)=0.$$ ",
        " We'll approach this problem in three steps.\n#### Step 1: Let $a$ be the first term and $d$ be the common difference of the arithmetic sequence. Then, the general term, $t_{n}$, of the sequence is $t_{n} = a + (n - 1)d$. Using this, we can write the following two equations based on the given information:\n\\begin{align*}\na + 3d &= 200,\\\\\na + 7d &= 500.\n\\end{align*}",
        " \nIf the sequence has common difference $d$, then the fourth term is $4d+a$, where $a$ is the first term in the sequence.  Since the fourth term is $200$, we have $4d+a=200$.  Similarly, we have $8d+a=500$.  Since we want to find the sixth term, we want to find $5d+a$.\nWe can solve for $a$ in terms of $d$: $8d+a=500\\Rightarrow a=500-8d$.  We can substitute this into $4d+a=200$ to obtain $4d+500-8d=200\\Rightarrow -4d=-300\\Rightarrow d=75$.  Now we can find $a$: $a=500-8(75)=500-600=-100$.\nThe sixth term is therefore $5d-a=5(75)-(-100)=\\boxed{425}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 425.
