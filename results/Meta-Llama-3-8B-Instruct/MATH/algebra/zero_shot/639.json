        " We are given two functions, $f(x)$ and $g(f(x))$.\nLet's think about $f(x)$ first. We are given that $f(x) = 2x-3$. We know that $f(x)$ is a function of $x$. If we replace $x$ with a number, say $x=4$, we get $f(4) = 2(4)-3 = 8-3 = 5$. So, $f(4) = 5$. That is, if $x=4$, then $f(x)$ is equal to 5.\nNow, we are asked to find $g(4)$. But we don't know what $g(x)$ is. However, we are told that $g(f(x)) = 5-4x$. What this means is that if we replace $x$ with a number, say $x=4$, in $f(x)$, then the value of that expression will be the input to $g(x)$. So, we are replacing $f(x)$ with $5$ in $g(f(x))$ and asking what the result is. We know that $f(4) = 5$, so we can plug that into $g(f(x))$.\nWe can rewrite $g(f(4))$ as $g(5)$ to make it clearer.
