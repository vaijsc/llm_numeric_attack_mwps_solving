        " There are real numbers $A$ and $B$ such that\n\\[\\frac{5x-16}{x^2-7x+10}=\\frac{A}{x-2}+\\frac{B}{x-5}.\\]Find $A+B$.\nLet\u2019s think step by step.\n### Step 1\nWe can get rid of the denominator by multiplying both sides by the common denominator $(x-2)(x-5) = x^2-7x+10$: \n\\[\\frac{5x-16}{x^2-7x+10}=\\frac{A}{x-2}+\\frac{B}{x-5}\\Rightarrow \n5x-16 = A(x-5)+B(x-2).\\]\n### Step 2\nNow try to make the lefthand side appear on the right hand side by using the distributive law for multiplication by a sum of two quantities: \n$5x-16=(A+B)x-(5A+2B).$ \n### Step 3\nNow we can see that we need $5x-(5A+2B)=x$, so $A+B=5$ and $-5A-2B=-16$, so $B=1$.\n### Step 4\nWe have $A+B=5$, so $\\boxed{A+B=5}$.\nThanks for your help with this problem!

        " We will use the partial fraction decomposition to solve the problem. The partial fraction decomposition of $$\\frac{5x - 16}{x^2 - 7x + 10}$$ is $$\\frac{5x - 16}{(x - 2)(x - 5)} = \\frac{A}{x - 2} + \\frac{B}{x - 5}.$$ Multiplying both sides by $(x - 2)(x - 5)$, we get $$5x - 16 = A(x - 5) + B(x - 2).$$ Now, we can substitute in $x = 2$ to get $$-8 = A(-3) \\Rightarrow A = \\frac{8}{3}.$$ Similarly, if we substitute in $x = 5$, we get $$3 = B(3) \\Rightarrow B = 1.$$ Therefore, $$A + B = \\frac{8}{3} + 1 = \\boxed{\\frac{11}{3}}.$$Final Answer: The final answer is \\frac{11}{3}.

        " Let\u2019s begin by rewriting the equation as follows. \\[5x - 16 = A(x - 5) + B(x - 2).\\]We can distribute and then combine like terms. \\[5x - 16 = x(A - B) + 3(A - B).\\]To simplify this equation, we can add 16 to both sides and then divide through by 1: \\[5x = x(A - B) + 3(A - B) + 16.\\]Now let\u2019s distribute the parentheses on the right-hand side: \\[5x = xA - xB + 3A - 3B + 16.\\]We can now factor out an $x$ from all the terms on the right: \\[5x = x(A - B + 3) + 16.\\]To simplify the right-hand side, we can divide through by $x$: \\[5 = A - B + 3 + \\frac{16}{x}.\\]To simplify the last term, we can add 16 to both sides: \\[5 + \\frac{16}{x} = A - B + 3 + 16.\\]This is as far as we can simplify. Now that we have the equation, we can substitute the values we know in order to solve for $A$ and $B$.\n### ",
        " 1. First, let\u2019s multiply both sides of the equation by $x^2-7x+10$, which cancels $x^2-7x+10$ on the right hand side. This gives us:\n\\[\\frac{5x-16}{1} = A(x-5) + B(x-2).\\]\n### "
