        " To factor the quadratic, we must first find an common factor between $-35$ and $12x^2$:\nSo, we divide $-35$ by $12$: $\\frac{-35}{12} = -\\frac{5}{2}$, which is the integer part of $12$-th root of $-35$. That is $-7x$\u2019s coefficient.\nAnd, we divide $12x^2$ by $12$ : $\\frac{12x^2}{12} = x^2$. That is $2$\u2019s coefficient.\nSo, the other factor is $(7x-5)$:\nExplanation: In the problem, we have to find out what is the missing factor after we found one of the factors. They say that the missing factor is the other factor. We should find it using the factorization method.\nFirst, we know that the given quadratic is -35 - x + 12 x^2. And we know that one of the factors of the quadratic is 3x + 5.\nNext we need to find what is the other factor of quadratic. To find that we find the common factor between -35 and 12 x^2.\nThen we make the two parts of -35 and 12 x^2 divisible by the common factor. The common factor here is -7x.\nWe can write it like this: 12 x^2 \u00f7 12 = x^2 and -35 \u00f7 12 = -7x.\nThen we put this information to the equation to get the other factor: 7x - 5.\nTherefore we know the other factor is 7x - 5.",
        " First, we know that his factor will look like $(3x + 5)(x \\cdots)$. We also know that $(3x + 5)(x) = 3x^2 + 5x$, which is part of the quadratic expression of $-35 - x + 12 x^2$.\n#### (a) Solve for the value of $x^2$ that appears in $12x^2$ and the expression $3x^2 + 5x$ when the two expressions have the same coefficient for $x^2$.\nIf the expression $3x^2 + 5x$ is to appear as part of the factored quadratic, then we need the $x^2$ terms to cancel out. Therefore, we will equate the $x^2$ terms of $12 x^2$ with $3x^2 + 5x$. We have $12x^2 = 3x^2 + 5x$. We can solve for $x^2$ to get $9x^2 = 5x \\Rightarrow x^2 = \\boxed{\\frac{5}{9}}$.\n#### (b) Solve for the value of $x$ that appears in $-35 - x$, where the expression is rewritten in terms of the other factor.\nIn order to make the expression factorable, we want the $x$ term to be written in terms of the other factor. The goal is to replace the $- x$ term in $-35 - x$ with $5x$, which is what we previously determined would be part of the factored expression. We can do this by setting $(x \u2013?) = 5x$ to solve for $x$ or by setting $-x = 5x$ to solve for $x$. In the case of the former, we have $x - \\frac{5}{9} = 5x \\Rightarrow - \\frac{5}{9} = 4x \\Rightarrow x = \\boxed{-\\frac{5}{36}}$, while in the latter we have $-x = 5x \\Rightarrow x = \\boxed{\\frac{-1}{6}}$. In both cases, we can rewrite $-35 - x$ as $-35 - \\boxed{\\frac{5}{9}}x$, which matches our initial expression. or get the other $$-\\frac{5}{36}$$",
        " The factored form should look like: $$-(3x+5)(rx+c),$$ for some constants $r$ and $c.$\n### Problem: That is correct. The problem is to find the values of those constants. Now Robert can rewrite his expression in terms of $r$ and $c$: \\begin{align*}\n\\phantom{=\\,\\,}-(3x+5)(rx+c)&=-35-x+12x^2\\\\\n-(3x+5)(rx+c)&=12x^2-x+35.\n\\end{align*} Now we can use the distributive property and expand the left-hand side: \\begin{align*}\n-(3x+5)(rx+c)&=-12x^2-3xc-5rx-5c\\\\\n-12x^2-3xc-5rx-5c&=12x^2-x+35.\n\\end{align*} We know that $r$ and $c$ are constants, so the $x^2$ terms will cancel when we equate the two equations.  Therefore, we can equate the coefficients of the $x$ terms: $$-3c-5r=-1,$$ and the constant terms: $$-5c=35.$$\n### Problem: Now can you complete the solution?\n### Solution: Now we can solve for $c$ and $r$: \\begin{align*}\n-5c&=35\\\\\nc&=-7.\n\\end{align*}Then we plug that back in for $c$, and solve for $r$: $$-3(-7)-5r=-1$$ $$21-5r=-1$$ $$5r=20$$ $$r=4.$$ Now Robert knows that the other factor is $(4x-7).$  So the factored form of the expression is $-(3x+5)(4x-7).$",
        " We know from factoring a quadratic of the form $ax^2+bx+c$, if $(x-d)$ is one factor, the other factor must be $(x-e)$, where the product of $d$ and $e$ is equal to $c/a$ and if $d+e = -b/ a$.\nWe know that the quadratic is represented as $12 x^2-35 +x$.

By the Remainder Theorem, if $f(x)$ is a polynomial and $\\displaystyle f(a)$ is a zero of $f(x)$, then $x-a$ divides $f(x)$. In particular, since $3x+5$ is a factor, it must be the case that $x$ is the root of $f(x)$, so $$f(-\\frac{5}{3}) = 0.$$ Expanding $f(x) = -35-x+12x^2$, we obtain $$f(-\\frac{5}{3}) = -\\frac{160}{3}+\\frac{100}{3}+40 = 0.$$ Finally, solving for $x$ gives us $\\boxed{x=-\\frac{5}{3}}$, so our other factor is $x+\\frac{5}{3}$, and our answer is $(3x+5)(x+\\frac{5}{3}) = 0$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is (7,-1).

        " 1. Since $3x + 5$ is a factor, then $x = - \\frac{5}{3}$ is a root of $-35 - x + 12x^2.$\nFor $x=-5/3,$ we have \\begin{align*} -35 - x + 12 x^2 &= (-35) - \\left(-\\frac{5}{3}\\right) + 12 \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{5}{3}\\right)^2 \\\\&= -\\frac{65}{3} + 12 \\cdot \\frac{25}{9} \\\\&= -\\frac{65}{3} + \\frac{300}{9} \\\\&= -\\frac{65}{3} + \\frac{300}{9} \\\\&= 0.\\end{align*} Therefore, $x=-5/3$ is a zero of $-35 - x + 12 x^2,$ and it must be the root found by $3x + 5.$\n### Solution: We must factor the cubic expression by $$-35-x+12x^2$$ in order to find the other factor of the polynomial. The given factor we are provided with is $$-3x-5$$ thus we look for a polynomial whose values are going to be multiplied by -3x-5 and get $$-35-x+12x^2$$. The best candidate for this value is x+7 as a result $$x+7$$ and $$-3x-5$$ need to be multiplied together in order to get the desired result We now need to multiply $$x+7$$ and $$-3x-5$$ in order to get the other factor, $$12x^2-x+35$$. The important thing to remember when trying to factor a polynomial is to look for roots by using these numbers as multipliers.\n### Create a visual diagram:\nA graph of the quadratic $$12x^2-x+35=0$$ and the factor $$3x + 5$$\n### ",

        " The lesson showed us that factoring means putting the expression in a product of simpler forms. So, instead of that messy equation $-35 -x + 12x^2$, let me rearrange it: $-35 - x + 12x^2 = 0$. Now I must find two factors that when multiplied together, result in this damn quadratic expression. Let\u2019s say the other factor is $ax+b$. So the other factor is $ax+b$. I can rewrite my equation like this: $(ax+b)(3x+5) = 0$. As I know, when two factors multiply, the constant term is the product of the two constant terms, so $ab = (-35)$. So, the product of $a$ and $b$ must be -35. Because there are two positive factors of -35 (1 and -35), and two negative factors of -35 (-1 and 35), the two unknown numbers $a$ and $b$ must be one of these following pairs: $(1, -35), (-1, 35), (-1, -35), (35, -1)$. So I take the factors, and test out to see which one gives me the correct equation.
