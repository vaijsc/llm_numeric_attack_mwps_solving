        "To solve for the digit \\(\\Delta\\) in the equation given, we start with the relation:\n\\[\n\\frac{144}{\\Delta} = 1\\Delta\n\\]\nWe can express \\(1\\Delta\\) as \\(10 + \\Delta\\). Thus, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\\[\n\\frac{144}{\\Delta} = 10 + \\Delta\n\\]\nNext, cross-multiplying gives us:\n\\[\n144 = \\Delta(10 + \\Delta)\n\\]\nExpanding the right-hand side results in:\n\\[\n144 = 10\\Delta + \\Delta^2\n\\]\nRearranging this into a standard quadratic form gives us:\n\\[\n\\Delta^2 + 10\\Delta - 144 = 0\n\\]\nWe can use the quadratic formula to solve for \\(\\Delta\\). The quadratic formula states that for an equation of the form \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\):\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\nIn our case, \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 10\\), and \\(c = -144\\). We first compute the discriminant:\n\\[\nb^2 - 4ac = 10^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (-144) = 100 + 576 = 676\n\\]\nNext, we take the square root of the discriminant:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{676} = 26\n\\]\nNow substituting into the quadratic formula:\n\\[\n\\Delta = \\frac{-10 \\pm 26}{2}\n\\]\nCalculating the two possible values:\n1. Using the positive root:\n\\[\n\\Delta = \\frac{-10 + 26}{2} = \\frac{16}{2} = 8\n\\]\n2. Using the negative root:\n\\[\n\\Delta = \\frac{-10 - 26}{2} = \\frac{-36}{2} = -18 \\quad (\\text{not a valid digit})\n\\]\nThus, the only valid solution is:\n\\[\n\\Delta = 8\n\\]\nTo confirm our solution, we substitute \\(\\Delta = 8\\) back into the original division:\n\\[\n\\frac{144}{8} = 18\n\\]\nHere, 18 corresponds to \\(1\\Delta\\) with \\(1\\) as the tens digit and \\(8\\) as the ones digit. \nThus, the digit represented by \\(\\Delta\\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{8}\n\\]",

For simplicity, let's denote 1Delta by x , so our equation becomes 144 / Delta = x. Dividing by 144 , we get 1 / Delta = x / 144 ( Yada yada , 144 = 12 x 12. Dividing each side by 12 again, we get 1/12Delta = x / 144 ) .  Simplifying gets us 1 / 12Delta = 1/12 . We can solve for Delta by multiplying both sides by 12Delta : 12/ Delta = 1 . Multiply both sides by Delta : 12 = Delta . However, since we know Delta is the units place, or the right digit , it can't be as big as 12 , because then the two numbers would not be in the single units place , it would be in the 100s .  Therefore, the smallest positive integer that makes this happen is 4. Furthermore, since 140 divided by Delta would equal 14 with 1 in the tens place , and Delta is the units place , we know Delta has to equal 4 .

This gives $\\Delta \\ge 4$, and $144/\\Delta$ must be a one-digit integer, so $1 \\le 144/\\Delta < 10$.

        " $\\boxed{4}$\nBy trial and error, we find that 144 / \u0394 = 36 when \u0394 = 4. Indeed, among the possible values \u0394 = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, only \u0394 = 4 yields an integer quotient.\nLet\u2019s go further and try to explain what happens. We are asked to find the value of \u0394 such that 144 / \u0394 = 1\u0394. In other words, we are required to find an integer \u0394 that satisfies the following condition:\n$$\\frac{144}{\\Delta}=1\\cdot\\Delta$$\nOne way to start is to simplify everything and write\n$$144 = \\Delta^2$$\nThis equation is clearly satisfied when \u0394 = 4. However, the equation has only one solution because the LHS is a constant while the RHS is second-degree monomial. Actually, when \u0394 is an integer, so is \u0394^2, so \u0394 has to be an integer itself. In case where \u0394 is an integer, A21/2 = 144 returns \u0394 = \u00b112 or \u00b124 (it doesn\u2019t return positive \u00b14 since it\u2019s impossible). At any rate, only \u0394 = 4 satisfies that condition. Given a divisor, each carries its own profile, representing different quadrilaterals created by points. So, \u0394 represents $\\boxed{4}$. All attempt must work in accordance with rules of doing math homework. \n$4$ is an integer that satisfies the equation and it is possible to do calculations with integer. If we double check with friendly calculator, we will note that it also satisfy other condition 144 / 4 = 36.\nI love this problem as it requires you to test clever different ways of finding the solution, rather than just a very direct solution. I was also glad to use a calculator to solve this problem as, other elements with a number or percentages which they do.\nTo find the number of \u0394, go through divisions such as 144 / 1 = 144, 144 / 2 = 72 and 144 / 3 = 48. Now, go through each division and find if the remainder equals the division.\n144 / 1 = 144, 4 remainder.\n144 / 2 = 72, 0 remainder.\n144 / 3 = 48, 0 remainder.\n144 / 4 = 36, remainder of 0, so the number is 4.\nFinally, $\\boxed{4}$.

        " Interesting! To help solve this problem, we could try some basic values for $\\Delta$.\nWe know $144 / \\Delta = 1 \\Delta$, so $144 / \\Delta = 10 + \\Delta$. We can visualize this as a particular sort of equation.\nIf we let $\\Delta$ be the ones digit, we can plug in other possible values for $\\Delta$ (e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) and see what works.\n### Analysis:\nThus, we plug in $\\Delta = 0$, $\\Delta = 2$, $\\Delta = 4$, $\\Delta = 6$, and $\\Delta = 8$ which all lead to contradictions.\nHowever, there are only 9 integers that we haven\u2019t tried. If we now plug in $\\Delta = 1$, $\\Delta = 3$, $\\Delta = 5$, $\\Delta = 7$, and $\\Delta = 9$, all of those will cause contradictions as well.\nThus, there must be some other digit for $\\Delta$, and since integers only go from 0 to 9, we must choose some other digit. Thus, we have one possible digit left, which is $\\boxed{\\Delta = 9}$.\nMore specifically, when we divide $144$ by $9$, our quotient is $16$ with a remainder of 0. Therefore, $144 / 9 = 16$. Therefore, the digit that is represented by $\\Delta$ is $9$.\nNext Next\n### \ufb01n itself\nback back\n### Other content\n### Functions\n### Background\n### Python\n### Git\n### Directories\n### Articles\n### Literature\n### Glossary\n* Correctness\n* Hacking\n* * .

So we see that $\\Delta^2 < 144$ ($10k$ is a positive integer, so we cannot have 144-$\\Delta^2$ be a multiple of $\\Delta$), which gives $\\Delta<12$.  In particular, this means that $\\Delta\\leq 6$ and $\\Delta^2<36$.  So we want $0<144-\\Delta^2<144$, so $\\Delta<12$ and $\\Delta^2<144$, and $k$ is an integer.
