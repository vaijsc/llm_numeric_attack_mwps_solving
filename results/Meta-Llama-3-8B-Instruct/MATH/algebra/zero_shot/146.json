        "To find the cost of one pencil, we can break down the problem step by step.\n1. **Find the cost of one pen**:\n   We know that seven pens cost $9.24. To find the cost of one pen, we can divide the total cost by the number of pens:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of one pen} = \\frac{9.24}{7}\n   \\]\n   Performing the division:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of one pen} = 1.32 \\text{ (in dollars)}\n   \\]\n2. **Find the total cost of three pens**:\n   Since eleven pencils cost as much as three pens, we need the cost of three pens. We simply multiply the cost of one pen by 3:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of three pens} = 3 \\times 1.32 = 3.96 \\text{ (in dollars)}\n   \\]\n3. **Relate the cost to pencils**:\n   We know now that the total cost of three pens is equal to the cost of eleven pencils:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of 11 pencils} = 3.96 \\text{ (in dollars)}\n   \\]\n4. **Find the cost of one pencil**:\n   To find the cost of one pencil, divide the total cost for eleven pencils by 11:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of one pencil} = \\frac{3.96}{11}\n   \\]\n   Performing the division:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of one pencil} \\approx 0.36 \\text{ (in dollars)}\n   \\]\n5. **Convert the cost to cents**:\n   Since we want the cost in cents, we multiply by 100 (as there are 100 cents in a dollar):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of one pencil in cents} = 0.36 \\times 100 = 36\n   \\]\nThus, the cost of one pencil is \\(\\boxed{36}\\) cents.",
        "To find the cost of one pencil in cents, we first need to determine the cost of one pen. Given that seven pens cost \\$9.24, we can calculate the cost of one pen as follows:\n1. **Calculate the cost of one pen**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of one pen} = \\frac{\\text{Total cost of seven pens}}{\\text{Number of pens}} = \\frac{9.24}{7}\n   \\]\n   Performing the division:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of one pen} = 1.32 \\quad \\text{(This means one pen costs \\$1.32)}\n   \\]\n2. **Determine the cost of three pens**:\n   Now that we know the cost of one pen, we can find out how much three pens cost:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of three pens} = 3 \\times \\text{Cost of one pen} = 3 \\times 1.32 = 3.96 \\quad \\text{(This means three pens cost \\$3.96)}\n   \\]\n3. **Relate pencils and pens**:\n   According to the information provided, the cost of eleven pencils is equal to the cost of three pens. Therefore:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of eleven pencils} = 3.96\n   \\]\n4. **Calculate the cost of one pencil**:\n   To find the cost of one pencil, we need to divide the total cost of eleven pencils by eleven:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of one pencil} = \\frac{\\text{Cost of eleven pencils}}{11} = \\frac{3.96}{11}\n   \\]\n   Performing the division:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of one pencil} = 0.36 \\quad \\text{(This means one pencil costs \\$0.36)}\n   \\]\n5. **Convert the cost from dollars to cents**:\n   Since the problem asks for the cost in cents, we need to convert dollars to cents:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost in cents} = 0.36 \\text{ dollars} \\times 100 = 36 \\text{ cents}\n   \\]\nTherefore, the cost of one pencil is \\(\\boxed{36}\\) cents.",

        " In this solution, we will convert all price values into cents, since it allows for simpler arithmetic.  Pen A = 3 / 11 of a pencil B. Pen B = (924 cents) / 7. To find the cost of a B, we plug in the above formula in the given equation: (924 cents) / 7 = 3 / 11 of a B. Solving for B, we get: B = (11/3)\\*(924 cents) / 7 = (44)\\*(924 cents) / 21 = (44/1)\\*(72) = 3168 cents Solving for one pencil price, we multiply the result by (11/3). 1 * (11/3) \\*(3168 cents) = 10512 / 3 = 3520.00 cents. To identify our answer, it is 3520.00 cents. Final Answer: The final answer is 3520.00 cents. I hope it is correct.  Step by Step Solution: 1) there are three pens that cost $\\$9.24$; that is, the sum of the price of three pens is$\\$9.24$.  So, the price of one pen is $\\dfrac{\\$ 9.24}{3}$. We will call this value PA. Then PA = $\\dfrac{\\$ 9.24}{3}$. 2) There are eleven pencils that cost the same as three pens. So, the price of eleven pencils is $\\$9.24$, too. The price of one pencil, we will call this value PB, is $\\dfrac{\\$ 9.24}{11}$and we use the same variable in the next equation. 3) The equation given, exactly duplicate PA, eleven pencils cost as much as three pens. That is to say, eleven pencils is $\\$9.24$too. But we know that the price of one pen is PA. 4) In expression (2), we multiply both sides of the equation by $\\frac{33}{3}$; 33 is eleven's multiple, a multiple that can be expressed by three in the subscripts. After multiplication, the equation could be written as: PB $\\times$ 11 = PA $\\times$ 3 $\\Rightarrow$ PB $\\times$ 11 = $\\dfrac{\\$ 9.24}{3}$ $\\times$ 3. 5) Then divide both sides of",
        " We set up a system of equations. Let $p$ be the cost of 1 pen and $c$ be the cost of 1 pencil. We know that 7 pens cost$\\$9.24$, so the cost in cents of 7 pens is $7p = 924.$ Since the cost in cents of 1 pen is $p = 924/7 = 132,$ we have that $p = 132.$ Next, we know that 11 pencils cost as much as 3 pens. Therefore, $11c = 3p.$ We have that $p = 132$, so $11c = 396.$ Finally, the cost in cents of 1 pencil is $c = 396/11,$ which is$\\boxed{36}$cents.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 36.

        "  We start by noting that the price of 11 pencils is the same as the price of 3 pens.  Let $n$ be the cost, in cents, of a pen.  Then the cost, in cents, of 11 pencils is $11x$.

We are given that $7$ pens cost $9.24$ dollars. Setting these equal, we get the equation $4x=9.24.$\n### Final Answer: The final answer is 23. It may not be correct.\n### Solution 1(Think of it)\n$\\12$ pencils cost as much as $\\3$ pens, so $\\12 / 3 = 4$ dollars are $\\3$ pens. Since $\\7$ pens cost $\\9.24$, $\\9.24 / 7 = 1.323$ dollars are $\\1$ pen. And since $\\4$ dollars are $\\3$ pens, $\\1.323$ dollars are $\\frac{3}{4}$ pen.

        " Eleven pencils cost as much as three pens. If seven pens cost $\\$ 9.24$, what is the cost, in cents, of one pencil?\n#### Step 1: Calculate the cost of 1 pen.\nLet\u2019s first calculate the cost of 1 pen. Cost of 7 pens $=9.24$. To find the cost of 1 pen, we divide the cost of 7 pens by 7: $$\\frac{9.24}{7} = 1.32$$",
        " Let one pen be the unit. We can find that 11 pencils is equivalent to 3 pens, so 7 pens is equivalent to 3.5 pencils. Since seven pens cost $\\$9.24$, or $ 924$ cents, one pen is worth $\\frac{924}{7} = 132$ cents. Three pens would be $3\\cdot 132 = 396$ cents, which is 3.5 pencils. A pencil is therefore $\\frac{396}{3.5} = 112.57$ cents. We round that to $\\boxed{112}$ because it is safer.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 112. I hope it is correct.  ### Alternative solution First, find the cost of one pen. If seven pens cost 9.24 dollars, then each pen costs$9.24 \\div 7 = \\$1.32$. If a pen costs$1.32, then 3 pens cost $1.32 \\cdot 3 =$3.96. So, 3.5 pencils cost$\\$ 3.96$. So, a pencil is worth\n$\\frac{\\$3.96}{3.5} = \\$1.12$ or 112 cents. We round up to 112 because it is safer. Thus, the answer is 112. Final Answer: The final answer is 112. I hope it is correct.  ### Yet another solution Suppose one pen is p cents, then 3 pens are 3p cents. Since eleven pencils cost as much as three pens, 11p = 3p. $$Therefore, p = 11p - 3p = 8p$$  Since seven pens cost 924 cents, we know that p = $\\frac{924}{7}$ cents. The total value of 3 pens is $\\frac{924}{7} \\cdot 3 = 396$. Dividing 396 by 3.5 (the number of pencils), we find that one pencil is $\\frac{396}{3.5} = \\boxed{112}$ cents.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 112. I hope it is correct.

        " Let the cost per pencil be dollars $a$and per pen be dollars $b$. The equation in the story is then written as $11a=3b$. Since the cost, in dollars, of seven pens is $\\$ 9.24$, that is, it is equal to$7b$, we have that $7b=9.24$. Let us subtract $3b$from both sides of the equation, and factoring out $b$from the left-hand side of the equation, we obtain:\n$$4b=9.24-3b.$$Factoring out $b$from the right-hand side of the equation, we obtain $b(4-3)=9.24-3b$. Solving for $b$gives $b=2.76$. Therefore, since the ratio of the cost per pencil to the cost per pen is $11:3$, we have that the cost per pencil is $\\frac{3}{11}b=2.52$.  The cost of one pencil is thence $\\boxed{252}$ cents.\n### Final Answer: The final answer is 252. I hope it is correct. Final Answer: The final answer is 252.

Eleven pencils cost as much as three pens, so $$11x=3y.$$ We know that seven pens cost 924 cents, so we can also write $$7y=924.$$ Multiplying both sides of the first equation by $\\frac{7y}{3y}$, we get $22x=7y=924$. Finally, dividing both sides by 22 gives us $x=\\boxed{42}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 42.
