I know that the square root of $\\pi$ is irrational, but what's wrong with using an irrational number in this case?\nYou are right that the square root of $\\pi$ is irrational, but in this problem, the square root is not an irrational number, it's an imaginary number. The square root of a negative number is an imaginary number, which is not a real number. The domain of the square root function is the set of non-negative real numbers. We cannot use the square root function to find the square root of a negative number.\nI see now. So the domain of the square root function is restricted to non-negative real numbers, so I cannot use it for $\\pi$ which is greater than 4, but less than 0.\nThat's correct! In this problem, you need to use the second line of the definition of $f(x)$, which states that $f(x) = 2$ when $0 \\le x < 4$.

        " First, note that $\\pi \\approx 3.14$. So $\\pi$ is less than $4$. This means the second case of the above definition of $f(x)$ is applicable: \\begin{align*} f(\\pi) &= 2. \\end{align*} Final Answer: The final answer is 2. I hope it is correct.

        " Since $\\pi$ is approximately $3.14$, so it is greater than $0$. And $\\pi<4$, so $\\pi$ falls into the second case of the piecewise function. In this case, the function has a constant value of $2$. So, $f(\\pi) = \\boxed{2}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2. I hope it is correct.",
        " \nWe are given a function f(x) with three cases. Clearly, $\\pi$ is greater than 0 and less than 4. That means the case when 0 \\le x < 4 is true, so we have $f(\\pi) = 2.$ \nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2. I hope it is correct.  Let me know if you have any questions.",
