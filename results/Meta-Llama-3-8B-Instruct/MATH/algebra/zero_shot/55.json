        "To evaluate the expression \\(\\log_{\\sqrt{8}}(64\\sqrt{8})\\), let's start by simplifying both the base and the argument.\n### Step 1: Rewrite the base and the argument\n1. The base \\(\\sqrt{8}\\) can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{8} = 8^{1/2}\n   \\]\n   Further simplifying it, since \\(8 = 2^3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{8} = (2^3)^{1/2} = 2^{3/2}\n   \\]\n2. The argument \\(64\\sqrt{8}\\) is:\n   \\[\n   64 = 2^6 \\quad \\text{(since \\(64 = 2^6\\))}\n   \\]\n   Thus, we can rewrite:\n   \\[\n   64\\sqrt{8} = 64 \\cdot \\sqrt{8} = 2^6 \\cdot 2^{3/2} = 2^{6 + 3/2}\n   \\]\n   To combine the exponents, convert \\(6\\) to a fraction with the same denominator:\n   \\[\n   6 = \\frac{12}{2}\n   \\]\n   Therefore:\n   \\[\n   6 + \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{12}{2} + \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{15}{2}\n   \\]\n   So, we have:\n   \\[\n   64\\sqrt{8} = 2^{\\frac{15}{2}}\n   \\]\n### Step 2: Rewrite the logarithmic expression\nNow we can substitute back into the logarithmic expression:\n\\[\n\\log_{\\sqrt{8}}(64\\sqrt{8}) = \\log_{2^{3/2}}(2^{\\frac{15}{2}})\n\\]\n### Step 3: Use the change of base formula\nUsing the property of logarithms that states \\(\\log_{a}(b^c) = c \\log_{a}(b)\\), we can express this logarithm in a simpler form:\n\\[\n\\log_{2^{3/2}}(2^{\\frac{15}{2}}) = \\frac{15}{2} \\log_{2^{3/2}}(2)\n\\]\nNext, we find \\(\\log_{2^{3/2}}(2)\\). \nUsing the change of base formula for logarithms, we have:\n\\[\n\\log_{2^{3/2}}(2) = \\frac{\\log_{2}(2)}{\\log_{2}(2^{3/2})}\n\\]\nSince \\(\\log_{2}(2) = 1\\), and:\n\\[\n\\log_{2}(2^{3/2}) = \\frac{3}{2}\n\\]\nThus:\n\\[\n\\log_{2^{3/2}}(2) = \\frac{1}{\\frac{3}{2}} = \\frac{2}{3}\n\\]\n### Step 4: Substitute back\nNow substitute \\(\\log_{2^{3/2}}(2)\\) back into our expression:\n\\[\n\\log_{\\sqrt{8}}(64\\sqrt{8}) = \\frac{15}{2} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{15 \\cdot 2}{2 \\cdot 3} = \\frac{15}{3} = 5\n\\]\n### Conclusion\nThus, the final result is:\n\\[\n\\log_{\\sqrt{8}}(64\\sqrt{8}) = 5\n\\]\nThe answer is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).",

Here's the solution. My teacher didn't explain how to find the answer but I got to it by using the change of base formula. Say that a log is a question of the function: $b^x= y$.
