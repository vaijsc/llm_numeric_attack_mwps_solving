        " Let $y = 2x + 5$. Then we need to find $g(y)$. We know that $g(2x + 5) = g(y) = 4x^2 - 3x + 2$. So we can think of $g(y) = C_1 y^2 + C_2 y + C_3$ for some constants $C_1,C_2,C_3$. We then have\n$$4x^2 - 3x + 2 = C_1 y^2 + C_2 y + C_3 = C_1 (2x + 5)^2 + C_2 (2x + 5) + C_3.$$\nWe thus want to equate the coefficients of the polynomials so that $C_1 = 4$, $C_2 = -3$ and $C_3 = 2$. So our $g(y)$ is $g(y) = 4y^2 - 3y + 2$. Therefore,\n$$g(-3) = \\boxed{-5}.$$\n### Note:\nThe above response originally incorrectly equated $2x^2 - 3x + 2$ and $4x^2 - 3x + 2$.

        " Start by letting $2x+5 = u$. So $x = \\frac{u-5}{2}$. Then $g(u) = g(2x+5) = 4x^2 - 3x + 2$.

        " To find $g(2x+5)$, we would need to know what $g(x)$ is.  Currently, we are given a formula for $g(2x+5)$ without a formula for $g(x)$.  This information is not sufficient to find $g(-3)$. Alternatively, we could try to guess $g(x)$.  If we let $2x+5 = y$, we can re-express the given equation as: $g(y) = 4(\\frac{y-5}{2})^2 - 3(\\frac{y-5}{2}) + 2$  This is in terms of $y$, so we can try to isolate $g(x)$: $g(2x+5) = 4(\\frac{(2x+5)-5}{2})^2 - 3(\\frac{(2x+5)-5}{2}) + 2$  Distributing and simplifying, we get: $g(2x+5) = 4(x)^2 - 3x + 2$  This is equal to our original equation, so $g(x) = 4x^2-3x+2$.  This means we can find $g(-3)$ by substituting $x = -3$ into $g(x)$: $g(-3) = 4(-3)^2 - 3(-3) + 2$  Calculating, we get $g(-3) = \\boxed{17}$. Final Answer: The final answer is 17.
