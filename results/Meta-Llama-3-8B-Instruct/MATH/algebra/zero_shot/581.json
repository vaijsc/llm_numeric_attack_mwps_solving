        " ####\nStep 1: Convert $3y=2x^2-16x+18$ into general form.

The $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $-\\frac{b}{2a}$ where $b=-\\frac{16}{3}$ and $a=\\frac{2}{3}$. Thus, the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $$m=-\\frac{b}{2a}=\\frac{16}{6}=\\frac{8}{3}$$\nStep 3: Now that we have the $x$-coordinate of the vertex, we can find the $y$-coordinate of the vertex using the equation of the parabola. To find the $y$-coordinate of the vertex, we need to substitute $x=\\frac{8}{3}$ into the equation and solve for $y$.\nSubstituting $x=\\frac{8}{3}$ into the equation, we have $$y=\\frac{2}{3}\\left(\\frac{8}{3}\\right)^2-\\frac{16}{3}\\cdot\\frac{8}{3}+6=\\frac{32}{9}-\\frac{64}{9}+6=\\frac{2}{9}+6=\\frac{58}{9}$$\nThe vertex is thus $$(m,n)=\\left(\\frac{8}{3},\\frac{58}{9}\\right)$$\nStep 4: Finally, to find $m+n$, we add the $x$-coordinate and the $y$-coordinate of the vertex to get $$m+n=\\frac{8}{3}+\\frac{58}{9}=\\frac{24+52}{9}=\\boxed{\\frac{76}{9}}$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\frac{76}{9}.

Therefore the parabola is in the form $\\frac{2}{3}y=x^2-\\frac{16}{3}x+6$.\n### Step 2:\nThe vertex is at $x=\\left(-\\frac{b}{2a}\\right)=\\frac{16}{2\\cdot2/3}=\\frac{16}{4/3}=4/3$. Since the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $\\frac{16}{4/3}$, $m=\\frac{16}{4/3}$.

        " \nLet's start by rearranging the equation into the standard form to find its vertex: $$3y=2x^2-16x+18$$ 3y2 = 3 2x^2 - 16x + 18 The focus is always in the middle of the given equation, so we can bring all the terms to one side. 0 = 2x^2 - 16x + 18$$ The next step is to separate it into the quadratic form. 0 = 2(x^2 - 8x) + 18$$ The quadratic form is now $$x^2 - 8x + 18$$, which is where we can find the vertex. If we recognize that this is the expression $(x-4)^2$, we know that its minimum value will be at x-4=0. The vertex will be at 4, then. Now, we need to find y to simplify the equation. Subtracting 18 from both sides gives us $$-(18) = 2(x-4)^2$$Undoing the subtraction operation back to the left side $\\implies$ negating both sides 2(x-4)^2 = -18$$\nThe best way to solve this problem is by recognizing that since it\u2019s a quadratic equation, the opposite of it means the negative value of the equation. Let\u2019s arrange it in the correct form to isolate y.\n$$y=-1 * (x-4)^2/1$$ Noting that y changes as the value of x shifts. The slope of this equation is its reciprocal. As the value of y decreases, the value of x increases.\nThe vertex is always the middle point, which we already found. It is at the point 4. This is also the point of maximum value for y.\nOutput: $$m = 4$$, $$n = -1 * (4-4)^2/2$$, $$n = -1 * 0/2$$, $$n = 0$$\nm+n = 4+0 = 4\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 4. I hope it is correct.",

        " \nWe start with expanding out the expression in the equation given: $3y = 2x^2 - 16x + 18.$ Distributing the $2$ to the x terms, we get $3y = 2x^2 - 32x + 18.$ Again, in the x terms we distribute the $32$ to the $x$ so we get $3y = 2x^2 - 32x + 18.$ To get our equation in standard form, we have to get it into the form $y=ax^2+bx+c$ where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are real numbers. We can do this by dividing by $2$ to get $3y/2 = x^2 - 16x + 18.$ Now we move the constant terms over to the right side by writing it as $3y/2 - x^2 + 16x = 18.$ Finally, we add $x^2$ to both sides of the equation to get $3y/2 + 16x = x^2 + 18.$ This is now in standard form. To get the vertex of the parabola, we use the x-coordinate of the vertex, $m$, by algebraically solving the equation by completing the square. We start by subtracting $9$ from both sides to get $3y/2 + 16x = -9.$ Subtracing $x^2$ from both sides of the equation, we get $3y/2 + 16x - x^2 = -9.$ To get the left side in perfect square form we are going to add $49$ to both sides of the equation. So we get $3y/2 + 16x - x^2 + 49 = -9 + 49.$ Simplifying this, we get $\\frac{3y}{2} + 16x - x^2 + 49 = 40.$ Square the left side of the equation by multiplying the original equation by the original equation. Also, multiply it by $2$ so that everything on the left side of the equation is not negative because division is on the right hand side. Or multiply left side by $4$. This gives us, $(\\frac{3y}{2} + 16x - x^2)^2 = 1600.$ Distributing the two, we have $9y^2/4 + 192xy",
