Each ticket costs $\\$20$ initially. The discount amount is$$0.25\\cdot20\\cdot4=\\$ 20.$$So the total cost she paid is $$\\$ 20\\cdot 4 -\\$20 = \\$60$$\n#### Pam:\nPam bought 5 tickets with a 30% discount. Each ticket costs$\\$ 20$ initially. The discount amount is $$0.30\\cdot20\\cdot5= \\$ 30.$$ So the total cost she paid is $$\\$20\\cdot 5 -\\$30 = \\$70$$\n#### Find the difference:\nThe difference in the amount they paid is $$\\$70-\\$60=\\boxed{\\$10}$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 10. I hope it is correct. ### Similar Problems 1. Two friends, Alex and Ben, buy lottery tickets. Alex buys a ticket costing$\\$10$, and Ben buys a ticket costing $\\$30$.

        " When Susan uses a $25\\%$ discount coupon, she will have to pay $\\frac{75\\%}{100\\%}$ = $0.75$ of $\\$20$per ticket. For$4$final tickets, the amount she pays will be$20*0.75*4 = \\ 60$. When Pam uses a $30\\%$ discount coupon, she will have to pay $\\frac{70\\%}{100\\%}$ = $0.7$of$\\$20$ per ticket. For $5$ final tickets, the amount she pays will be $20*0.7*5 = \\ 70$. So, Pam pays $\\boxed{\\10}$ more than Susan.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 10.

        " \nSusan buys $4$ tickets, each of which is discounted by $25\\%$.

Pam buys $5$ tickets, each of which is discounted by $30\\%$. That means the price of each ticket is$20 \\cdot (1-\\frac{3}{10})=20 \\cdot \\frac{7}{10}=\\frac{14}{1}=\\$14$, and so Pam pays $5 \\cdot 14=\\$70$.

        " The discount for Susan is$0.25\\$, so she pays $\\20\\cdot0.75=15$ per ticket, giving a total of $\\15\\cdot4=\\$60$ for 4 tickets. Similarly, Pam pays $\\20\\cdot0.70=\\$14$ per ticket, giving a total of $\\14\\cdot5=\\$70$ for 5 tickets. Since Pam\u2019s purchase is$\\$70-\\$60=\\boxed{\\$10}$ more, the answer is$\\boxed{10}$. Final Answer: The final answer is 10. I hope it is correct. ### Comment: You can also use algebra to find the solution.$t=$ the price of a ticket when discounted\nSubstituting this in the equation for the cost of one discounted ticket, we have $t=20(1-d)$, where $d$ is discount rate\nSubstituting this into the equations for Susan and Pam, we have $s=4t=4(20(1-0.25))$ and $p=5t=5(20(1-0.3))$ Substituting these equations in for $t$, we have $s=4(20(1-0.25))=80(0.75)=60$ and $p=5(20(1-0.3))=100(0.7)=70$ Finally, we have $p-s=p-60=70-60=10$\nTherefore, Pam pays 10 dollars more than Susan. The final answer is 10. I hope it is correct. Note:  We were able to solve this problem using different rules by simplifying to single equivalent problems and solving. The goal is to create a simple problem that we could solve with ease, like a single algebra equation. This is just one example of how to approach a problem. For more challenging problems or other ways to approach the problem, you should consult with your instructor or other resources. Final Answer: The final answer is 10. I hope it is correct.### Feedback: This response is correct. It provides a clear, step-by-step solution to the problem, and the algebraic approach is a great way to solve these types of problems. I would only suggest adding a bit more guidance on why the problem could be approached algebraically, e.g. \"Notice that we can represent the price of a ticket as$20 times a discount factor $(1-d)$. This allows us to simplify the equations",
        " I started with an easy request. It takes Susan 4$20 = 80 to buy 4 tickets, after the 25% discount, she only needs to pay 80*(1-0.25) = 60.  Pam pays 5 * 20 * (1-0.3) = 70. The difference is 70 - 60 = 10. Pam pays 10 more dollars.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 10. I hope it is correct. ### They show that Pam pays$\\$ 10$ more than Susan. They correctly recognized that Susan\u2019s discount was $25\\%$and Pam\u2019s was $30\\%$. They then performed the necessary calculations correctly to determine that Pam paid$\\$ 10$ more than Susan.\nThis solution is correct. However, the students could have also approached this problem by simply writing a system of equations to solve.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 10. I hope it is correct. ### The problem is asking us to find the difference in amount of money that Pam and Susan will pay. We know that Pam will pay $\\$70$and Susan will pay$\\$60$.  Therefore, we simply need to subtract the two values to find the difference:\n$\\$70-\\$60=\\$10$\nThe problem is asking for the difference in dollars. The difference is $\\boxed{\\10}$.  Therefore, the answer is 10. I hope it is correct.##  Final Answer: The final answer is 10. I hope it is correct.### Since each ticket originally costs$\\$20$, Susan needs to pay 4 x 20 = 80 dollars.  But she gets a 25% discount.  This means that she only has to pay 0.75 x 80 = 60 dollars.\nPam also gets a discount, but hers is 30%.  The amount of her discount is 0.7 x 5 x 20 = 100.  The total amount that Pam needs to pay is 5 x 20 - 100 = 50.\nPam pays \\$50 and Susan pays $\\$60$.  So Pam pays$\\$10$ more than Susan. Therefore, the answer is 10. I hope it is correct.## Final Answer: The final answer is 10. I hope it is correct.### The question could be solved in two ways: (1) by calculating the total cost for each buyer and then subtracting the amounts",

        " Suppose that Susan uses her coupon to buy 4 tickets at a price of 25% discount (0.25). The original price of each ticket is 20$. With a 25% discount, it is 20 * (1 - 0.25) = 20 * 0.75 = 15$. With 4 tickets, Susan will pay 4 * 15 = 60$.\nNow let\u2019s think about Pam. With 5 tickets, her total price is: 5 * 20 = 100$. With 30% discount (0.30), the price of each is 20 * (1 - 0.30) = 20 * 0.70 = 14$. For 5 tickets, she will pay 5 * 14 = 70$.\nSo Susan will pay 60$and Pam will pay 70$. The difference is$70-60=\\boxed{10}$, so Pam will pay$10 more dollars than Susan. Final Answer: The final answer is 10. I hope it is correct.

        "  # Solution We will solve the problem step by step. 1. First we need to calculate the price of each ticket. Susan buys 4 tickets and has a 25% discount. 25% of 20 is 0.25 \u00d7 20 = 5. So she gets a discount of 5 dollars on each ticket. Susan pays$20 - \\$5 = \\$15 per ticket. 2. So the total amount she pays for the 4 tickets is 4 \u00d7 \\$15 = \\$60. 3. Pam buys 5 tickets and has a 30% discount. 30% of 20 is 0.30 \u00d7 20 = 6. So she gets a discount of 6 dollars on each ticket. Pam pays \\$20 - \\$6 = \\$14 per ticket. 4. So the total amount she pays for the 5 tickets is 5 \u00d7$14 = \\$70. 5. Now we need to subtract the amount Susan paid from the amount Pam paid, which is \\$70 - \\$60 = \\$10. \u2022 Let\u2019s add it up! In Part 1, 4 tickets*15 dollars ~ 60 dollars. In Part 2, 5 tickets*14 dollars ~ 70 dollars. So, 70 - 60 is 10 dollars. That means Pam pays 10 dollars more than Susan! We are done! ! (Two thumbs up) # Final Answer: The final answer is 10.

So we have two equations. wiith two variables.\n### Solution:If Susan buys$4$tickets using a 25% coupon, the discount is \\$5, $4\\times \\$20-\\$5=4\\times \\$15$. If Pam buys $5$ tickets, the discount is $30\\%$, which is equal to$\\$15$. So we can think of a calculation: $\\$15$=$\\$went off Pam\u2019s 5$-$5 \\times \\$20=5 \\times \\$20- \\$15= \\$20$You can add the money that Pam spent to get: \\$20+ \\$20= \\$40. Susan has spent 4 \\times \\$ 15 and has \\$20 + 4 \\times \\$ 15 = 80. So the difference between the Pam and Susan money is: \\$40- \\$80 = - \\$40. On the last page, you can check the difference: Pam spent more than Susan. So we can find the correct answer: $\\boxed{40}$. Final Answer: The final answer is 40. I hope it is correct.

        " First, Susan buys 4 tickets with 25% discount, that means the price will be 20 - 5 = 15 per ticket. So Susan pays 4 * 15 = 60 dollars.  Next, Pam buys 5 tickets with 30% discount, that means the price will be 20 - 6 = 14 per ticket. So Pam pays 5 * 14 = 70 dollars.$ So the difference between Pam and Susan is $\\boxed{70-60=10}$. Final Answer: The final answer is 10. I hope it is correct.### "
