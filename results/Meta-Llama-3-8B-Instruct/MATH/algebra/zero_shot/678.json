DataFrame Filter pandas. How to search a list? find if an element exist in a list in python. patrich , then comment to me!\n#### patrich5k: \nCan you provide more information about how to filter data with pandas DataFrame? Or maybe you want to filter based on a condition. I know for sure you can solve the problem using list methods in python. #### Referenced Sources:\nhttps://www.w3resource.com/pandas/data-manipulation/object-filter-data-frame.php\nhttps://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.filter.html\nhttps://www.python-course.eu/pandas filtrate a list.mp4\nFor this filtering problem:\n`31^2` is greater than `19^2` by 600.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 600. I hope it is correct.  `print(df[df['column_name'] > '19^2'].shape)` this function can be used to find all the rows in which column is greater than 19^2. remember column_name is the column name in your dataframe. let say you have a DataFrame `df` and you want to filter where data of column `x` is greater than 19^2 you can do like this. \n```\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\n    'A': [1,2,3,4,5],\n    'B': [5,4,3,2,1]\n})\nprint(df[df['B'] > 961].shape))\n```\nThis will give you the shape of that particular DataFrame in which data of column B is greater than 19^2\nHere are the list methods:\nlist1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]\nprint(3 in list1)  # Returns true\nprint(7 not in list1) # Returns false\nYou can find if an element exist in a list in python using the 'in' operator. For example:\n```\nlist1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]\nprint(3 in list1)  # Returns",
        " \n{ Buckley's solution: First consider just the square: $31^2=31\\times31=961$.  Now, $19^2=361$.  So, we can conclude that $31^2$ is $\\boxed{600}$ greater than $19^2$. }\n{ If you're like me, you can also re-write this question as the difference between $31^2$ and $19^2$, or $961 - 361 = 600$, which checks out. }\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 600.
