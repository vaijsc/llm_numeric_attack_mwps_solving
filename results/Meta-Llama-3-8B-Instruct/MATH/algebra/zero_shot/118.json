        " First, we do algebra. We can manipulate the two given equations. Our first equation is $x + y = 7$. If we subtract $y$ from both sides of the equation, we get $x = 7 - y$. Our second equation is $x - y = 9$. We can also add $y$ to both sides of the equation to get $x = 9 + y$.\nNow we have two different ways to express $x$: $x = 7 - y$ and $x = 9 + y$. We can use either one. Let\u2019s use the first one. We have $x = 7 - y$. Since we know what $x$ is, we can plug it into our first equation. We get\n\\begin{align*}\n(7 - y) + y&=7\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 7&=7\n\\end{align*}\nwhich is true. So this all looks good. Finally, we can multiply $x$ by $y$.

        " x+x-y=7 y = 7-9 = -2 x = 9+2 = 11\n### ",
        " 1. Add the given equations:\n\\begin{align*}\n(x + y) + (x - y) &= 7 + 9\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\quad 2x &= 16\n\\end{align*}\n### ",
        " First we are given that $x+y = 7$. Now, we are also given that $x - y = 9$. This gives us 2 equations with 2 unknowns.\n### ",
        " $x + y = 7$ is an equation in which the terms of $x$ and $y$ are added.\nSo we have $$x + y = 7$$\n### Next Step:\n$y = 7 - x$ . With given equation we have another equation $$x - y = 9$$\nNow, substitute the expression of $y$ into the below equation:\n$$(x) - (7 - x) = 9$$\n### Expression of y:\nSo we have $$2x = 18$$ Now solve for $x$ $$x = 9$$ With any equation we have another equation $$y = 7 - 9$$\n### Expression of y:\nFinally, we have $$y = -2$$\n### Expression for Total Product:\nCurrently, we have our $x = 9$ and $y = -2$, so you can calculate the product $xy$ as follows:\n$$(x) (y) = (9) (-2) = -18$$\n### Final ",
        " $x + y = 7$ represents a line passing through $(0,7)$ and $(7,0)$\n$$(x,y) = (0,7)$$ is a point on the above line.\n### ",
        " By the way, think you can use algebra...\n#### We have $x+y=7$\n#### and $x-y=9$\n#### to solve for $x$ and $y$\n#### Let $x+y=7$ $(1)$\n#### Let $x-y=9$ $(2)$\n#### Add $(1)$ and $(2)$ to find $x$\n#### $x+y+x-y=7+9$\n#### $2x=16$\n#### $\\boxed{x=8}$\n#### Add $y$ to both sides of $(1)$ to get\n#### $x+y+y=7+y$\n#### $2y+7=y$\n#### $y=0$\n#### $x=8$\n#### So $\\boxed{\\text{xy}=0}$\n####",
        " Let\u2019s solve for y.\nFrom $x + y = 7$, I subtract x from both sides.\n$\\displaystyle y=x+7$ Now, I use the second equation $x - y = 9$ and add y to both sides.\n$\\displaystyle x-y+y=9+y$ Simplify.\n$\\displaystyle x=9+y$\nNow, I substitute $x = 9+y$ into $y = x+7$.\n$\\displaystyle y=(9+y)+7$ Combine like terms.\n$\\displaystyle y=16$\nNow, I substitute $y = 16$ back into $y = x + 7$.\n$\\displaystyle 16=x+7$\nSubtract 7 from both sides.\n$\\displaystyle x=9$\nNow, I multiply x and y to get the product.\n$\\displaystyle xy=x(16)$ Simplify.\n$\\displaystyle xy=9\\times16=\\boxed{144}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 144.

        " We are given the equations\nx+y=7\nx-y=9\nIf we add these two equations, we obtain $$2x=7+9=16\\implies x=8.$$Substituting this value of $x$ in either of the original equations gives us that $y=7-8=-1$.
