        " First, we know that $a>0$ and $b>0$. Then what are our choices for this problem?\nIf we set $a$ to 3 and $b$ to 1, we know that we are going to get a logarithm with the base 3, because $\\log_3 1 = 0$, and the base does not matter when we are raising $a$ to the power $b$. Therefore, when we are writing $\\log_381$, it looks like we are finding $b$, which is equal to, where $b$ is equal to the number of times that we need to take the base 3 for that expression to be a 1.\nNow, let\u2019s evaluate $\\log_381$.\n### Solution: Now that we have reset to commonly used bases, we can return to those bases that are not commonly used. The base 2 is one of those commonly used. Evaluating this problem further, we know that the logarithm of 1 is 0. Now, we can reset $a$ to 3 and $b$ to 1. As we all know, any number that is divided by itself is equal to 1. So, b = c x.\nNow that we have reset our $\\boxed{\\log_381}$ to 1 Andhra Pradesh. This thing should be better.\n## Conclusion:\nFrom the question, we know that The base is called $a$, and the number is $b$, and the answer should be $b = c \\log_3 1$, And that\u2019s what we did. We did reset it to a commonly used base, and we got $b = c \\log_3 1 = 0$.\n### Final Answer:\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{0}.$ I hope it is correct. Let me know if you need any further assistance.

        " The solution to the problem is\nFirst we notice that $\\log_3 1 = 0$, and $\\log_3 3 = 1,$ so we can find other powers of 3 which will help us find approximations.\nWe can substitute 8 in for $81$ in the equation $\\log_3 81$, or $\\log_381$. Starting 81 gives $9$ powers of 3:\n $$3^9=19683$$\nThe second step is to understand that 19683 has a huge difference between 81 and this number. In this sense, it is different. To find the closest approximate power of 3 to the number of $81$, which is $4$, we have to use a tolerance of at least 1e-6.\nSo, the base change formula is used to find the actual value of 4 = $\\log_380$.\nAs we make the approximation more accurate, the value of the logarithm gets closer and closer to 4. Thus, the log of 81 base 3 will be the solution to $\\log_381$, or $\\boxed{4}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 4. I hope it is correct. Let me know if you have any confusion. Thanks.
