        " Factor the following expression: $28z^{97}+7z^{96}$.\nWe know that $\\gcd(28,7)=7$. This means that if we divide both terms by 7, we get $\\frac{28z^{97}}{7}+\\frac{7z^{96}}{7}=4z^{97}+z^{96}$. Notice that this expression involves only powers of $z$ because these are the same throughout.\n### Did you tried: Factoring by grouping?\nWe can factor by grouping. Because $z^{97}$ appears with coefficients $4$ and $1$, we can factor out $z^{97}$ from both of these, leaving us with $(4+1)z^{96}z^{1}=5z^{97}$.\n### I think you can't forget the 4z^{96} term:\nYou are absolutely right! I must not forget the $4z^{96}$ term, which remains within the parentheses. That means we can rewrite our factorization as $7(z^{96}(4z+1))$. Now we have our final answer.\n### Final Answer: The final answer is 7z^{96}(4z+1). I hope it is correct.",

        " 7z^{96}(4z+1)\n### Explanation: We can remove the GCF of $28$ and $7$ from the expression, leaving us with $4z^{96}(4z+1)$. Failure to recognize that we can remove the GCF will leave us with the answer $7z^{96}(4z+4)$, which is incorrect. Factor 28 out: 28(1+z^{96}) Step 1: Factor out the greatest common factor, $7z^{96}$, from the terms. 28z^{97}+7z^{96} = \\boxed{7z^{96}(4z+1)}",

        " By looking at $28z^{97}+7z^{96}$, we see that they both are powers of $z$, so we have a common out factor. We just have to pull it out.

If not, your question is, given the same exponents, what can you pull out to simplify the expression? It is $\\boxed{7z^{96}}$. That is the GCF that could simplify the expression. Now we know that $28z^{97}+7z^{96}$ factors as $\\boxed{7z^{96}(4z)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 7z^{96}(4z). I hope it is correct.  I don't think so. There are a number of things that are just plain wrong here.\n### Update:\nI think we need to rethink.\nWe just need to factor out a common factor of $7z^{96}$.\n$28z^{97}+7z^{96}$ = $7z^{96}(4z+1)$.\nSo the final answer is $\\boxed{7z^{96}(4z+1)}$.

Since both numbers are multiples of 7, and 7z^{96} is a common factor in both terms, I thought to factor it out. Now, I can factor out 28z+1 out of 28z^{96} as well. This results in the simplified expression (28z+1)z^{96}. And, since 7z^{96} is a common factor in both terms, it can be factored out.

        " We can factor both terms: $$28z^{97}+7z^{96}=\\boxed{7z^{96}(4z+1)}$$And that\u2019s the correct answer. Does that make sense?",
        " First, it would be good to pull out any common factors. Since 7z^{96} is less than 28z^{97}, we pull out a 7 to get $7(4z^{96}+28z^{97})$. It may seem like there isn\u2019t much of a difference in these two expressions, but this step is important... namely, $7$ is now conveniently factored as well. The 7 was placed outside of parentheses because of our goal to factor $28z^{97}+7z^{96}$.\n### ",

        " $$14z^{96}(2z+1)$$\nThe only way for the terms to have the same variable is for them to have the same exponent.
