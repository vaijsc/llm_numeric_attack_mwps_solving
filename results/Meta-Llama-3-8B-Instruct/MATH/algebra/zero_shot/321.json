In the world of technology, we have many terms that define different levels of something. For example, the term \"electronics\" defines all electronic devices, covering various categories such as personal computers, smartphones, TVs, radios, and more. Another example is the term \"computer\" in the \"electronics\" category. It does not particularize the type of computer, but all indistinguishable. In what sense does this question make sense? If we only know that $3$ and $9$ are both integers, then we can not determine the value of $x$. It's like trying to find the number of heads you would get by flipping a coin with a certain probability, but without knowing the probability. You cannot predict or guess it because the information given is not enough to make a prediction.
