        " \rWe are given a linear equation $5y = 2x$ which is in the slope-intercept form. This form of a linear equation is :\ny = mx + b   (a) This tells us about the slope of the line which is 'm' and the y-intercept which is 'b'.\nFrom equation (a), we know that m = 2/5 and b = 0.\nSo the equation is y = (2/5)x + 0. That is,\ny = (2/5)x   (b)\nNow we have another equation $3x -4y = 7$. This is in the point-slope form which is:\ny = mx + y1\nWhere m is the slope and y1 is the y-coordinate of the line. Now our equation becomes:\ny = (-3/4)x + 7/4 (c)\nNow we are told that the two lines $5y = 2x$ and $3x - 4y = 7$ are intersecting at a point Z. Any two lines in a rectangular coordinate system will intersect at exactly one point for any two distinct lines.\nSo the coordinates of point Z will be the solution to the equation formed by equating the expressions y in equations (b) and (c).\nEquating y from equations (b) and (c), we have:\n(2/5)x = (-3/4)x + 7/4\nNow we can solve for x:\n(2/5)x - (-3/4)x = 7/4\n(8/20)x + (15/20)x = 7/4\n(23/20)x = 7/4\nx = (20/4) * 7/(23/20)\nx = 35/1 * 7 / 23\nx = (35/1) * (7/23)\nx = 5/2.18\nx = 2.5\nNow we have the value of x. Now we have to find the value of y. Using equation (b), we have:\ny = (2/5)x\ny = (2/5) * 2.5\ny = (5/5) * 2.5\ny = 1.25\nThe points which intersects the line $5y = 2x$ and $3x - 4y = 7$ are (2.5, 1.25",

Since both lines intersect at one point $Z(x, y)$, the $y$-coordinates will be the same for both lines.\nHence, $y=\\frac{2}{5}x = \\frac{3}{4}x-\\frac{7}{4}\\implies \\frac{2}{5}x = \\frac{3}{4}x-\\frac{7}{4}\\implies x=\\frac{35}{8}$.\nSo we substitute $x=\\frac{35}{8}$ into one of the lines, say $5y = 2x$:\n$5y = 2(\\frac{35}{8}) \\implies y = \\frac{35/4}{5} =\\frac{7}{4}$\nHence, $Z=\\boxed{\\left(\\frac{35}{8},\\frac{7}{4}\\right)}$.
