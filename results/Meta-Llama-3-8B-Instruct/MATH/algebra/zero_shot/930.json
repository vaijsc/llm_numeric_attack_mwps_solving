        " Since we know that $y=x^2+4x+6$ and $y=\\frac{1}{2}x^2+x+6$ intersect at $(a,b)$ and $(c,d)$, $a$ and $c$ must satisfy these equations.\nWe can solve the equations $x^2+4x+6=\\frac{1}{2}x^2+x+6$ for $x$ to find the values of $a$ and $c$. So first we subtract $\\frac{1}{2}x^2+x+6$ from $x^2+4x+6$. We get $\\frac{1}{2}x^2+3x$. We then subtract $\\frac{1}{2}x^2$, $x$, and 6 from $x^2+3x$. We get $3x-6$.\nWe then add $3x$ and $6$ to $3x-6$. We get $3x$. We then add $6$ to $3x$. We get $3x+6$. So when we simplify, we get $x^2+4x+6=\\frac{1}{2}x^2+x+6$, we get $3x$. So $3x$ must equal 0. This means that $x$ must equal $\\frac{0}{3}$. We know that $x$ is a value, so we divide both sides by 3. We then get $\\frac{0}{3}$ divided by 3. This is just 0. When we simplify, we get $\\frac{3x}{3}$ and $\\frac{0}{3}$. This gives us $\\frac{0}{1}$, or just 0.

So, if we rewrite the second equation as y = (1/2)x^2 + x + 6 , we can set the right-hand sides equal to each other and solve for x: $$x^2+4x+6=(1/2)x^2+x+6.$$ We can rearrange to get $(1/2)x^2+x+4x+6=(1/2)x^2+x+6,$ which simplifies to $x^2+5x+6=x^2+x+6.$ (Heightened) After we simplify $(1/2)x^2+x+4x+6=(1/2)x^2+x+6,$ we are left with $x^2+5x+6=x^2+x+6$. We can subtract $x^2$ from both sides to get $5x+6=x+x+6.$ The following step is trying to undo the $(x^2)$ on the left and subtracting $x$ from both sides gets us $4x+6=6+6$. At this point, we can subtract $6$ from both sides to get $4x=6.$ Doing the opposite of $x$, we obtain $x=6/4$ or x = 3/2.

Given equations are: $y=x^2+4x+6$ and $y=\\frac{1}{2}x^2+x+6$ And also the attribute values are $a,b,c,d$ #### Step 2: Find the point of intersection using both equations. We are given two equations, let\u2019s set them equal to each other. We get, $x^2+4x+6 = \\frac{1}{2}x^2+x+6$ Now simplify, we have,\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{2}x^2+4x+6&=\\frac{1}{2}x^2+x+6\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\quad 3x&=0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\quad x&=0\n\\end{align*}#### Step 3: Now we substitute the value of x in one of the equations to find the value of y. We take equation 1 since it\u2019s easier: $y=0^2+4(0)+6=6$ So we got 2 points of intersection (0,6). #### Step 4: State the problem. This problem asks us to find what is c-a. #### Step 5: Now we look at the problem again and we see that c >= a, it means c can not be less than a. Means c is the largest number. Now we know one point we got is (0,6) and if c >= a, we can say c = 0. Then c-a = 0-0 = 0. So Answer is 0. Final Answer: The final answer is 0. I hope it is correct. #### Step 6: Editor\u2019s Note: One could also use the quadratic formula to solve for $x$ in each of the equations. This would give rise to two complex solutions. Since one of the given points is $(0,6)$, $x=0$ is clearly a real solution. Therefore, we can conclude that the other point of intersection is $(0,6)$ as well. This approach also yields $c=a=0$, and hence $c-a=\\boxed{0}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 0. I hope it is correct. ###### Final Step 6: Product Popularity Test.

        " What we know and what we can be sure of\nWe can be sure of the following:\n1. We are considering two parabolas which intersect at two distinct points: $$(a,b) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad (c,d).$$\n2. The coordinates $(a,b)$ and $(c,d)$, of the parabola $y=x^2+4x+6$, are points where the expression $y = (x-2)^2 + 10$ is true.\n3. The coordinates $(a,b)$ and $(c,d)$, of the parabola $y=\\frac{1}{2}x^2+x+6$, are points where the expression $y = \\frac{1}{2}(x+\\frac{1}{2})^2+\\frac{25}{2}$ is true.\nWe cannot be sure of the following: \n### How we should proceed\nNow that we know what we can and cannot be sure of, we can proceed to find the solution by comparing the parabolas. Here's a rough outline:\n1. Solve for $x^2$ and simplify. $x^2+4x+6$ $x^2+4x+4=2(x^2+2x+2)$ $\\Rightarrow(x+2)^2=2(x+1)^2+2$ $2x^2+2x+2=x^2+2x+2$ $\\Rightarrow x^2+6x+4=0$\n2. Solve for $x^2$ and simplify. $\\frac{1}{2}x^2+x+6$ $\\frac{1}{2}(x^2+2x+4)=\\frac{1}{2}(x^2+2x+4)+6$ $\\frac{1}{2}x^2+2x+4-\\frac{1}{2}x^2-\\frac{4}{2}x-4=0$ $\\Rightarrow(x^2+x+4)-\\frac{1}{2}(x^2+4x+4)=-\\frac{4}{2}$ $\\Rightarrow\\frac{1}{2}x^2+x+\\frac{4}{2}=0$\n### Calculating the values of $a$ and $c$.\nNow it's just a simple matter of finding the $x$-values for the two $y$-values in the two parabolas which"
