We know that $P(x) = 4x^3 - 2x^2 + 7x - 1$, so substituting that into $Q(x) = P(x)^2$, we get: \n$$Q(x) = (4x^3 - 2x^2 + 7x - 1)^2.$$ \nNow, we expand the expression inside the brackets. We know that $(a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2$. Using this formula for $a = 4x^3$, $b = 2x^2$, we get:\n$$(4x^3 - 2x^2)^2 = (4x^3)^2 - 2\\cdot4x^3\\cdot2x^2 + (2x^2)^2 = 16x^6 - 16x^5 + 4x^4.$$ \nSimilarly, using the formula for $(a - b)^2$ on $4x^3 - 2x^2 + 7x$, we get:\n$$(-1)^2 = 1$$ \nSubtracting this from the squared expression, we get:\n$$(-1)^2 = 1 - 1 = 0$$ \nFinally, we get: \n$$Q(x) = (4x^3)^2 - 16x^5 + 4x^4 + 7x + 0$$ This means Q(x) is a polynomial of degree 6.",

Sorry for next time.\nYou can also find the y-intercept by completing the square of $P(x) = 4x^3 - 2x^2 + 7x - 1$. The answer will be the same. We just tried to simplify the polynomial $Q(x)$ and then evaluate $Q(0)$. Is this answer normal? No, it should not. $Q(x)$ has a degree of 6. There should be more terms than just a constant in the answer.\nIn fact, we could also get a system of algebra equations and find the $a_i$\u2019s terms by using Newton\u2019s identities, but this is too complicated for our needs. Just plug in $x=0$ and simplify.\nThe question does not say to take the derivative of $P(x)$. This is a trick question. It is the x-intercept that is usually asked to find by taking the derivative, not the y-intercept.\nThe question is so complicated because $Q(x)$ is very messy. In fact, you can even use Wolfram Alpha to verify your answer. My Friends, we tried to simplify and understand polynomials. I hope my answer is correct. If you have any suggestions or better answers, please share them! We can also try Newton\u2019s identities and other methods to solve this problem.
