By looking at the problem, we instantly know that we need to substitute $n=3$ into both equations and solve for $t$.\nThe simplicity of the problem lies in the fact that $n=3$ does not involve any complex scenarios. The substitution of $n=3$ into both equations results in an algebraic calculation only. No need to worry about any tough scenario in this case. It was a straightforward calculation. I just did what was required in the problem. That's it! No more, no less.  ####How did you identify the key information in the question and the relationships between different parts of the question? I identified the key information in the question as the two given equations:\n$1)$ $t=2s-s^2$\n$2)$ $s=n^2 - 2^n+1$\nThe relationships between different parts of the question are the linking of variables $t$ and $s$ through the two equations. To find the value of $t$, we needed to find $s$ first and then substitute it into the equation of $t$. In other words, the relationships between $t$, $s$, and $n$ are essential for solving the problem.  #### Are there any related problems that you could think of? Yes! Since the problem involves relating two variables, $t$ and $s$, and another variable $n$, it could lead to other similar problems involving algebraic equations and substitutions. For instance, suppose:\n$1)$ $t=x+y-xy$\n$2)$ $x=n^2",
