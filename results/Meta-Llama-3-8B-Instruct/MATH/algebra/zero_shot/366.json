        " We have the following equation: $$0 = -9x^2 - 3x + 2.$$This equation has the form $f(x) = 0$, where $f(x)$ is a quadratic function. We can find the $x$ values which satisfy this equation by setting them equal to zero and solving the resulting quadratic equation.\nWe can use the quadratic formula to solve for $x$.

        " [x=\\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{9}}]\nSolution: We need to solve the given equation for x. Since x > 0, we will first let x = 1: Then, 0 = -9(1)^2 - 3(1) + 2 = -5. Hence, x = 1 is not a valid solution. Since x > 0, we will now consider x = 2. Then, 0 = -9(2)^2 - 3(2) + 2 = 2 - 9 = -7. Hence, x = 2 is not a valid solution.\nThen we will factorize and get the solutions for it. Factorizing -9x^2 - 3x + 2, we have -9x^2 - 3x + 2 = -9x^2 - 9x + 3x + 2 = -9x(x + 1) + 1(x + 1) = (x + 1)(-9x + 1) = 0.

The main thing here is that something must have to happen. So, there are the two options here because once there is a square below zero, then there will be only one option. Another feature of this proof is $x$ must be positive. That does not become a kind of barrier here when we selecting the correct square root now we would select that $x$-value which is that of positive counterpart of $x$-value of root $x-1/3$ and in other word we would go with + sign of square root.

Next, note that if we grab $x$ and move it all across to the right side, we would be dividing both sides by $-3$, like this:\n$0x^2 + \\frac{1}{3}x - \\frac{2}{3} = 0$.\nMove $x$ to the right side before factoring by multiplying both sides by $-3$:\n$\\frac{2}{3} - x^2 - \\frac{x}{3} = 0$.\nNow, we will turn our attention to factoring. We could say $-\\frac{1}{3}x$ is divided evenly between the terms and in the constant, so we will use that in our adj and subt. So, using $-x/3$ as our ADJ factor an $2/3$ as our sub $-x/3$, we get our factoring equaling the left side of this equation that\u2019s going to be $(x + 2/3)\\times(1(-x)3) = (1/3)x-2/3$.
