        " 24\n1. A polynomial with positive integer roots means that it has exactly two positive integer roots.  Therefore, it must have the factor $$(x - r_1)(x - r_2) = x^2 - (r_1 + r_2)x + r_1r_2$$ for some positive integers $r_1, r_2$.\n2. Suppose $r_1, r_2$ are positive integers.  Then, $$x^2 + mx + n = x^2 - (r_1 + r_2)x + r_1r_2 = x^2 - (x - r_1 - r_2)x + (r_1 + r_2)r_1r_2$$ Subtracting $r_1r_2$ from both sides yields $$x^2 + mx + (n - r_1r_2) = x^2 - (x - r_1 - r_2)x.$$ Comparing coefficients, we see that $n - r_1r_2 = 0$.  So, $n = r_1r_2$.\n3. So, we have $$x^2 + mx + 28 = x^2 - r_1r_2x + r_1r_2 = (x - r_1)(x - r_2).$$ Now we need to find how many values of $r_1, r_2$ satisfy $$r_1r_2 = 28.$$ In other words, we need to find how many pairs of positive integers whose product is 28.  Notice that 28 can be factored into  $2 \\cdot 14 = 4 \\cdot 7$.  From these products, we can find just two distinct values of $(r_1, r_2)$: $$(r_1, r_2) \\in \\{ (2, 14), (4, 7) \\}.$$\n4. We will count the number of distinct values of $(m, n)$.\nNotice that the product of $r_1, r_2$ gives the product of the roots of the polynomial.

Expanding the factorization, we have$$x^2+mx+28=x^2+(a+b)x+ab.$$Now, we can equate the linear coefficients to obtain $a+b=m$.  Also, equating the constant terms gives $ab=28$.  Since $a, b$ are positive integers, we must have $28=4\\cdot7$.

For $(r_1, r_2) = (7, 4),$ we get $m = 11$ and $28 + 11 = 39 > 0.$ So we can have $(r_1, r_2) = (7, 4)$ and $m = 11.$\n2.  \nIn conclusion, there are $\\boxed{2}$ polynomials with positive integer roots and $n = 28.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2.

I hope it is correct.#### How many polynomials of the form x^2 + mx + 28 are there with positive integer roots? Referring to the previous question, we know there are three values (1, 28), (2, 14), and (4, 7). So the answer is $\\boxed{3}.$#### There are $n=28$ of the form $x^2+mx+28$ which have positive integer roots. Find $m$.#### We first write the quadratic as$$x^2+mx+28=(x-r)(x-s).$$When we expand this, we get $x^2-(r+s)x+rs=x^2+mx+28$, so $m=-(r+s)$. When we equate the constant terms, we get $rs=28$. This tells us the product of the zeros. We need to find $m$, so we need to find the sum of the zeros. This will be a little tricky because we have several pairs of positive integers whose product is 28. We will assume that $1 < r < s$ to avoid a duplicate set of calculations.\\begin{align*}1\\times28&=28,\\quad\\text{and sum }=29,\\\\\n2\\times14&=28,\\quad\\text{and sum }=16,\\\\\n",
        " \nFirst, we need to use the fact that the product of the roots is equal to $n$, i.e., $r\\cdot s = 28$, where $r$ and $s$ are the roots. Therefore, the possible factors of $28$ are: $1\\cdot 28=28, 2\\cdot 14=28, 4\\cdot 7=28$. Hence, $rs=28$.\nSecond, let $r$ and $s$ be the positive integer roots. Then, the sum of roots $m=r+s$. Therefore, $$m=r+s=2i, 2i+14, 7,$$where $i$ is the imaginary unit. Hence, $m$ is also an integer and there are 3 possibilities.\nFinally, to get the possible polynomials of the form $x^2+mx+28$, we put in the possible values of $m$.\n$$\\begin{array}{lcl}\nx^2+28 & &\n\\\\\nx^2+14x+28 & &\n\\\\\nx^2+7x+28 & &\n\\end{array}$$\nIn summary, we have 3 polynomials with positive integer roots and $n=28$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 3.

We are given that $n = 28,$ so $$x^2 + mx + 28 = 0.$$We are also given that the roots of the polynomial are positive integers, so we have $$x - r = 0\\quad \\textrm{and}\\quad x - s = 0.$$By substituting $x$ with $r$ and $s$ respectively into $x^2 + mx + 28 = 0$, we get\n\\begin{align} r^2 + mr + 28 &= 0\\\\\ns^2 + ms + 28 &= 0. \\end{align}Subtracting $r^2$ and $s^2$ from both sides and rearranging, we get\n\\begin{align} m(r + s) &= -r^2 - 28\\\\\nm(r + s) &= -s^2 - 28, \\end{align}which gives $$m(r + s) = -28.$$ Since $r,s,28$ are nonnegative, $m$ must be nonpositive as well, so $m \\le 0$. Similarly, subtracting $m(r + s)$ from both sides and rearranging, we get\n\\begin{align} r^2 &= r(r + s) + 28\\\\\ns^2 &= s(r + s) + 28. \\end{align}By subtracting the two equations and using the fact that $r,s \\ge 1$, we get $$r - s \\le r(r + s) - s(r + s) + 28 - 28 = r^2 - s^2,$$which implies $$r - s \\le 0,$$that is, $s \\ge r$. Therefore, the remaining possibilities are\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item $r = s$\n\\item $r = s+1$\n\\item $r = 1, s = 2$\n\\item $r = 1, s = 3$\n\\item $r = 2, s = 2$\n\\item $r = 2, s = 3$\n\\item $r = 2, s = 4$\n\\item $r = 3, s =",
        " If a polynomial of the form x^2 + mx + n has positive integer roots, then those roots must be factors of n. Since n = 28, we need to find the number of ways to factor 28 into two positive integers.  The prime factorization of 28 is 2^2 * 7, so we need to find the number of ways to choose two factors of 2 and one factor of 7.  The number of ways to choose the two factors of 2 is C(2, 2) = 1.  The number of ways to choose the factor of 7 is 1.  Thus, the number of ways to factor 28 into two positive integers is 1 * 1 = 1, so there is only one polynomial of the form x^2 + mx + n with n = 28 and positive integer roots. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{1}.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 1. I hope it is correct. Regards! RISE Maths.\n### Example ",
        " My answer is 8. Here is my solution:\nThere are two positive integer roots. Let them be r and s. The two positive integer roots are r and s. Then $(x-r)(x-s) = x^2 - (r+s) x + rs.$\nSince r and s are roots, $r = -(m)/2$ because we know when we expand it out,\n\\begin{align*}\nx^2 + mx + 28 &= (x-r)(x-s)\\\\\n&= x^2 - \\left(\\frac{m}{2} + s\\right) x + sr\n\\end{align*}We know that sr = 28, therefore s = 28/r. Unfortunately, we are stuck with m. If we try to test for this polynomial, we will get the same formula. m is fully determined because r = m/2. Now $s$ is determined. To get our answer, we can let r = 1, then s is 28. Then we try to make it bigger. m = 2$r$, so m will increase, s = 28/r, but n stays the same. Roughly, our polynomial will look like $x^2 + (2\\cdot 1)x + 28 = x^2 + 2x + 28.$We test $r = 2$, and it will look like $x^2 + 4x + 28.$Try 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 14, 28 and since $r = 28$, we won\u2019t get anything else. Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{8}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 8. I hope it is correct.nts of polynomials of the form $x^2 + mx + n$ are there with positive integer roots and $n = 28?$\nLet\u2019s think step by step.\n### ",
        " There are $\\boxed{2}$.\nSo, our polynomial must be of the form $(x+p)(x+q) = x^2 + x(p+q) + pq$, so $m = p+q$ and $pq = 28$.  We find the prime factorization of 28: $$28 = 2\\cdot14 = 2\\cdot2\\cdot7.$$We can easily try the three possible cases.\n#### Case 1: Pairs of distinct primes.\nIf $p = 1$ and $q = 28$, we have $m = 29$ and a negative $n$ (which doesn\u2019t work).  If $p = 2$ and $q = 14$, we have $m = 16$ and $n = 28$, and if $p = 4$ and $q = 7$, we have $m = 11$ and $n = 28$.  So, we have two working polynomials."
