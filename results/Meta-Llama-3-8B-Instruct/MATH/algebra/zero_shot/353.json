        " The ball hits the ground when its height is zero; the equation for its height, then, would be $0 = -16t^2 - 60t + 54$. We know that, since $t$ is time, its units are seconds. This means the units of $-60t$ are $\\text{meters} \\cdot \\text{second}$, or $m$s; both of these terms will be squared when squaring $t$. Now, since 1 meter is equal to 3.28 feet, we have that $1 m = 3.28 \\text{ ft}$. This means that the units of $0 = -16t^2 - 60t + 54$ are $\\text{feet}$. When we solve this for $t$, our units are going to be $\\text{second}$. We require $t$, which is expressed in seconds, not $m$s, or even $ft$. The units are switching over. For a second $t$, this would be written as $t \\text{ s}$ Not doing anything wrong at this point, just clearing up confusion from the source. This is totally fine, and given we need $\\text{second}$\u2019s, we will keep moving. This equation is in quadratic form.

To find when the ball hits the ground, you will need to set $y = 0$ and solve for $t$.\n$$0 = -16t^2 - 60t + 54$$ Let\u2019s multiply through by 1.\n$$0 = -16t^2 - 60t + 54 \\implies 0 = 16t^2 + 60t - 54$$\nNext, we will move the constant to the other side of the equation. You will need to subtract 54 from both sides.\n$$0 = 16t^2 + 60t - 54 - 54 \\implies 0 = 16t^2 + 60t - 108$$\nNow, we will factor.\n$$0 = 4t(4t + 27)$$\nYou will need to find the zeroes of each factor. To do this, you can set each one equal to 0.\n$$4t = 0 \\Longrightarrow t = 0$$\n$$4t + 27 = 0 \\Longrightarrow 4t = -27 \\Longrightarrow t = -\\frac{27}{4}$$ To solve this problem, we need to choose the $t$ value that is in the real number domain, that is, it cannot be negative. So the time until the ball hits the ground is $t = 0.00$ seconds when the ball starts at the ground.\n### - Solution 2:\nFrom this situation, you will need to realize that if you plug in t = 0, y will be 54, which is the original height of the ball, which means you are at the original height. Plugging in other values for t will make the ball go down. For example, plugging in t = 1 will give you a height of 6 ft. At this point, the ball will be 6 ft from the ground. Now, let the height of the ball be 0 (that is, the ground). We can set it up as\ny = -16t^2 - 60t + 54 = 0\nA equation in standard form is for quadratic equations, so\nb^2 - 4ac = 0\nb = 60^2 = ",
        " \nLet $y$ be the height of the ball (measured in feet).

Therefore, $t = -1.25$ is extraneous (invalid) since we cannot throw the ball backward.  Then, we have that $t = \\boxed{0.0625 = 0.06}$, which rounds to 0.06 seconds.\nSecond solution:\nSolve the quadratic equation $-16t^2-60t+54=0$ by converting to standard form: $-16t^2-60t+54=0$ $-16t^2-60t\\phantom{:}+54\\phantom{:}=0$ $16t^2+60t\\phantom{:}-54\\phantom{:}=0$ $16t^2+60t\\phantom{:}-54t\\phantom{:}+27=0$ $16t^2+54t\\phantom{:}-6t+27=0$ $4t^2+13.5t\\phantom{:}-1.5=0$ $4t^2+18t\\phantom{:}-5.5t-1.5=0$ $4t(t+4.5)\\phantom{:}-5.5(t+4.5)=0$ $(4t-5.5)(t+4.5)=0$ Check both quadratic roots: $4t-5.5=0\\implies t=5.5/4=1.375$ $t+4.5=0\\implies t=-4.5$ (extraneous since time cannot be negative) Since we can\u2019t throw the ball backward, the only valid solution is the time it hits the ground. Thus, the ball hits the ground at $t=0.0625=\\boxed{0",
        " \nWe need to solve for $t$ in the equation $y = -16t^2 - 60t + 54$ when $y=0$.  Recall that the height of the ball at any given time $t$ is equal to $0$ when it hits the ground, so $$0=-16t^2 - 60t + 54.$$  We can solve this quadratic equation for $t$ using the quadratic formula$${t=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}}$$where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the coefficients of $t^2$, $t$, and the constant term, respectively.  In this problem, we have $a=-16$, $b=-60$, and $c=54$, so $$t=\\frac{-(-60)\\pm\\sqrt{(-60)^2-4(-16)(54)}}{2(-16)}=\\frac{60\\pm\\sqrt{3600+3456}}{-32}=\\frac{60\\pm\\sqrt{7056}}{-32}.$$  Simplifying, we obtain $$t=\\frac{60\\pm24}{-32}.$$  We must now choose the positive solution, as it corresponds to the first time at which the ball hits the ground.

PCBTA: 01 Here's the explanation: The given equation is $y=-16t^2-60t+54$. As the ball hits the ground, the value of $y$ is zero. Therefore, we have to solve the equation $0=-16t^2-60t+54$. We use the formula $t=\\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$. Here, $a=-16$, $b=-60$, and $c=54$. So, we have $t=\\frac{60\\pm24}{-32}=\\frac{30\\pm12}{-16}$.

Let\u2019s use technology to make it more precise. We just calculate $0.42$ seconds to get the correct answer. Correct",
        "\u00a0Solution 1\n$y= -16t^2 - 60t + 54$  When the ball hits the ground, y is 0. So $0 = -16t^2 - 60t + 54.$ We can now use the quadratic formula to solve this equation: $$t = \\frac{60 \\pm \\sqrt{3600 + 3456}}{2 \\cdot 16} = \\frac{60 \\pm \\sqrt{7056}}{32} = \\frac{60 \\pm 84}{32}. $$ From this, we can see the ball will hit the ground when $t = \\frac{60-84}{32} = \\boxed{-0.625} \\approx 0.38 \\text{ s}.$\nSolution 2\nt=-\\frac{b}{2a}+\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{b}{2a}\\right)^2-\\frac{c}{a}}. Plug in numbers and add negative. $t=-\\frac{-60}{2\\cdot-16}+\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{-60}{2\\cdot-16}\\right)^2-\\frac{54}{-16}}$ So, we have: $t=\\frac{60}{-32}+\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{60}{-32}\\right)^2-\\frac{54}{-16}}$  Substituting the numbers in the sqrt, you'll get -0.625 which is rounded to 0.38 s.\nWe now need to round it to the nearest hundredth. So, t ~ 0.38\nAnswer: 0.38 \\text{ s}.",
        " The time of impact is when the height of the ball is zero. Therefore, we need to find the value of $t$ such that\n$$-16t^2 - 60t + 54 = 0.$$Factoring the quadratic equation, we have\n$$-16(t^2 + 3.75t - 3.375) = 0.$$We recognize this as $(t - 0.4)(t - 3.125) = 0$. Thus, the ball hits the ground after 0.4 seconds and 3.125 seconds. Since the question asks to express the answer to the nearest hundredth, we can conclude that the ball hits the ground after $\\boxed{0.40}$ seconds.\nAnswer: The final answer is 0.40. I hope it is correct.\u5b69\u7eb8\u5f88\u9ad8\u5927.const carefulLCQ is flight2019 is goingWest; he needsby307 the find the IDE to access this chat log Open Chat Chat Open the chat window.

I hope it is correct. Now we have an answer current \u8bf7\u6d4f\u89c8\u6216\u8005\u7ee7\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u804a\u5929QQ\u7fa4 https://chat.q.qq.com/capsule/user/status?uin=&gid&st=7&num=11\nHere we find a equation $y = -16t^2 - 60t + 54$ describes the height of a ball. We need to find the value of $t$ such that $y = 0$, thus $0 = -16t^2 - 60t + 54$. Now we simplify to get $0 = -16(t^2 + 3.75t - 3.375)$. See whether the given equation has any form which we learned in school by looking at the ones we have studied, then as multiplication. Let $t$ equal zero, see if other $t$ equal our zero value.\nWe see that $t = 0.4$ or $t = 3.125$, which means we have a value that we just found values between. And we use the values found, and therefore hit the ground after $0.40$ seconds.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 0.40. I hope it is correct. I tried my best, but I do not"
