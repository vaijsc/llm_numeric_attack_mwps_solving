    "solution": "The cost increased by a factor of 2 due to the increase in cost per person and by an additional factor of 2 due to the increase in number of people.  In total, the cost increased by a factor of 4, so the ratio of the cost of the party in 2007 to the cost of the party in 2008 is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$.",

The ratio of the two parties is $\\frac{dp}{4dp} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$.\nFINAL TEXT:\nCorrect!\nThe correct ratio of the total cost of the party in 2007 to the total cost of the party in 2008 is indeed $\\frac{1}{4}$, which is equivalent to $\\frac{d\\cdot p}{4d\\cdot p}.$\nRemember to check your work and understand the math behind the solution.
