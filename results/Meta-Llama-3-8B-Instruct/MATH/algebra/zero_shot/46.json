        " \nFirst, we multiply both sides of the equation $\\frac{4a+3b}{a-2b}=5$ by $a-2b$ to get $4a+3b=5a-10b$, and then subtract $5a$ and add $10b$ to both sides to get $-7a+13b=0$.  Dividing both sides by $-1$, we get $7a-13b=0$.  Now, we rearrange the above equation as $7a=13b$.  Multiplying both sides by $\\frac{a-b}{a-b}$, we get $7a\\cdot\\frac{a-b}{a-b}=13b\\cdot\\frac{a-b}{a-b}$.  Simplifying the left side gives $7a(a-b)=7a^2-7ab$, and simplifying the right side gives $13b(a-b)=13ab-13b^2$.  So, we have $7a^2-7ab=13ab-13b^2$.  Adding $7ab$ to both sides, and subtracting $7a^2$ gives $0=20ab-7a^2-13b^2$.  Adding $7a^2+13b^2$ to both sides and simplifying gives $20ab=7a^2+13b^2$.  Dividing both sides by $20a$, we get $\\frac{b}{a}=\\frac{7}{20}+\\frac{13}{20}\\cdot\\frac{b}{a}$.  Subtracting $\\frac{13}{20}\\cdot\\frac{b}{a}$ from both sides, we get $\\frac{b}{a}-\\frac{13}{20}\\cdot\\frac{b}{a}=\\frac{7}{20}$, and then combine the terms on the left side gives $\\frac{7}{20}\\cdot\\frac{b}{a}=\\frac{7}{20}$.  Multiplying both sides by $\\frac{20}{7}$ gives $\\frac{b}{a}=1$.  We multiply both sides of $\\frac{a+11b}{a-b}=x$ by $a-b$, and simplify to $a+11b=xa-xb$, or $12b=xa-xb$, or $12a=a(x-1)$.

        " If $\\frac{4a+3b}{a-2b}=5$, we must multiply both sides by $a-2b$ to get $4a+3b=5(a-2b)=5a-10b$. Subtracting $4a$ and adding $10b$ to both sides yields $11b=5a$.  Also, we can rewrite $\\frac{a+11b}{a-b}$ as $$\\frac{a+11b}{a-b} = \\frac{a+11\\cdot\\frac{5a}{11}}{a-\\frac{5a}{11}}.$$  Now, we can cancel some terms:\n$$\\frac{a+11b}{a-b} = \\frac{a+5a}{a-(\\frac{5}{11})a} = \\frac{6a}{\\frac{6}{11}a}=\\boxed{11}.$$You can also use algebraic formula for this problem.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 11. I hope it is correct.  #### Algebraic Method: By the quadratic formula or by factoring, we have $$(a-2b)(4a+3b)=5a-10b$$ and so$$(a-2b)\\left((4a+3b)-5(a-2b)\\right)=0,$$giving either $a-2b=0$ or $5a-4a-13b+6b=0$. Hence either $a=2b$ or $a=3b/13$, but the question assumes$5=\\frac{4a+3b}{a-2b}$, so $a\\ne 3b/13$. The equation becomes $$5(a-2b)=4a+3b,$$and we can then solve for$$a-2b=\\frac{4a+3b}{5}=\\frac{4a+3\\cdot\\frac{5a}{11}}{5}=\\frac{4a+5a}{11}=\\frac{9a}{11}.$$Hence $$\\frac{a+11b}{a-b} = \\frac{a+11\\cdot\\frac{5a}{11}}{a-\\frac{5a}{11}}=\\frac{a+5a}{a-(\\frac{5}{11})a}=\\boxed{11}.$$Note that this is$3",

Since 2005 and 2006 are 1 apart, and no integer is divisible by both it and 5, we can ensure that 2006 is the largest integer that is not divisible by 2005. Proof. The first statement can be immediately clear, without a proof. For the second statement, if it were possible for an integer to be divisible by both 2005 and 2006, we could make one equal to the other by clearing denominators, and this would imply that they are equivalent, and the contradiction that no positive integer is both greater than and less than another is a proof of this. \nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2006. I hope it is correct.  #### 2021 Calculus Competitions AIME Of the following positive integers, which is the largest that is not divisible by 2005?\nAn exhaustive list of numbers one needs to check for divisibility is always the best solution to such a problem (for the most competitive solvers, at least, who can go quickly through the work). Thus, the list is going to be: 1,2006,2007,...,2010,2011,2012. Of these,",
