        " To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many meters Alice ran. We know the speed ($9\\ \\text{m/s}$) and the time ($12$ seconds). We can calculate her distance by the formula: $$\\text{Distance}= \\text{Speed}\\times \\text{Time}$$ Substitute her speed and time into the formula and solve:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Distance}&=9 \\text{ m/s} \\times 12 \\text{ s}\\\\\\\\\n&=108 \\text{ meters.}\n\\end{align*}\n### Solution: Therefore, Alice ran $108$ meters during her track meet. Final Answer: The final answer is 108. I hope it is correct. Let me know for any further information.\nThe positions of you and your friends can be seen from how many meters away you are from the center of the circle. Let's say you are m meters away from the center. The distance around the circle is $2\\pi r$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle. So you and your friends have to move around the circle from the center to this position which is m meters. Let's find out the distance to be covered:\n\\begin{align*}\nd&=2\\pi r-m\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\quad \\frac{d}{2\\pi} &= r-\\frac{m}{2\\pi}\\\\\n\\end{align*}Here, $\\frac{d}{2\\pi}$ is equal to $r-\\frac{m}{2\\pi}$. Also, you and your friends are positioned $m$ meters away from the center. You have to cover this distance to join your friends. To join them, you also cover a distance of m. So if $d$ is the distance you cover, $d$ equals to $2m$ because you cover both ways.\n\\begin{align*}\n2m &=2\\pi r-m\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\quad 3m &=2\\pi r\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\quad m &=\\frac{2\\pi r}{3}\\\\\n\\end{align*}Now, m is equal to $2/3$ of the circumference of the circle. That's why now you and your friends have got a larger circle.",
        " First, we can find her total distance by finding the area under the curve given by her speed. \\begin{align*} \\text{area}&=\\int_{}^{} 9\\ \\text{m/s}\\ \\text{dt}\\\\ & =\\int_0^{12}9\\ \\text{m/s}\\ \\text{dt}\\\\ & =\\left[9t\\right]_{0}^{12}\\\\ &=9(12)-9(0)\\\\ &=\\boxed{108} \\end{align*}\n#### Keywords\ndistance, speed, integral, area under the curve\n#### Video solutions \u2728\nUnit 12: Functions and Motion Problem-Solving Series (2019)\nFinal Exam #2 (May 2019) (2019)\nFinal Exam #1 (November 2018) (2018)\nFinal Exam #2 (May 2018) (2018)\n### Braille Solutions:\nThis solution is not available yet.
