I also have many notes on this topic, which can be found on my website: [here](https://mymathnotes.com/inverse-functions/).  Feel free to explore!  If you have any questions or need help with a specific problem, don't hesitate to ask.  Good luck with your studies!  Meditation: The inverse function is just like the reflection of a function in a vertical line.  If you reflect the function $f$ in a vertical line, you get the function $f^{-1}$.  Similarly, if you reflect a point in a vertical line, you get the corresponding point on the reflected function.  To find $f^{-1}(f^{-1}(6))$, you need to reflect $6$ once more, which results in $2$.  This helps in understanding the concept of inverse functions better.\nProblem: What is $f^{-1}(f^{-1}(5))$?\nAnswer: Since $f(3)=5$, we can deduce that $f^{-1}(5)=3$.

        " To solve this problem, you can use the fact that $f^{-1}(f(x)) = x$ for any function $f$ and $x$.  We can also use the fact that $f(x)$ means the input $x$ goes into $f$, and $f^{-1}(x)$ means the output $x$ goes out of $f^{-1}$. So the only way to find $f^{-1}(6)$ is to find the input of $f$ which corresponds to $6$ as output.\nSuppose $f^{-1}$ just says the prime factors of $f$, then by reading down, when $x=6$ then $f^{-1}(x)=2$ (Prime factor decomposition).\nWe can then substitute this into the equation $f^{-1}(f^{-1}(6))$, so $f^{-1}(f^{-1}(6)) = f^{-1}(2)$\nBy reading up, when $f^{-1}(x)=2$, then $x=1$ (Prime factor decomposition).\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 1.

Let me know if you have any other questions.  Assange: One way to see this is to realize that $f(f^{-1}(6))=6$. Therefore, $f^{-1}(f^{-1}(6))=f^{-1}(2)=1$. Also Assange: Another way is to say that $f^{-1}(f^{-1}(6))$ is asking for the number in the domain of $f^{-1}$ corresponding to 6. Since 6 is in the range of $f^{-1}$ corresponding to 2, this tells us $f^{-1}(f^{-1}(6))=\\boxed{1}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 1. I hope it is correct.
