        "To express the repeating decimal \\(0.6\\overline{333}\\) as a common fraction, we can start by breaking it down.\nLet \\(x = 0.6\\overline{333}\\). This means:\n\\[\nx = 0.6333333\\ldots\n\\]\nWe will separate the non-repeating part and the repeating part. The non-repeating part is \\(0.6\\), and we can write \\(x\\) as:\n\\[\nx = 0.6 + 0.0\\overline{333}\n\\]\nNext, we need to express \\(0.0\\overline{333}\\) as a fraction. We will define \\(y = 0.0\\overline{333}\\):\n\\[\ny = 0.0333333\\ldots\n\\]\nTo eliminate the repeating decimal, we can multiply \\(y\\) by 10:\n\\[\n10y = 0.33333\\ldots\n\\]\nNow, \\(0.33333\\ldots\\) is a well-known repeating decimal that equals \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\). Therefore:\n\\[\n10y = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\nNow, divide both sides by 10:\n\\[\ny = \\frac{1}{30}\n\\]\nNow we have:\n\\[\n0.0\\overline{333} = \\frac{1}{30}\n\\]\nSubstituting this back into our original equation for \\(x\\):\n\\[\nx = 0.6 + \\frac{1}{30}\n\\]\nNext, we need to express \\(0.6\\) as a fraction:\n\\[\n0.6 = \\frac{6}{10} = \\frac{3}{5}\n\\]\nNow substituting this into the equation for \\(x\\):\n\\[\nx = \\frac{3}{5} + \\frac{1}{30}\n\\]\nTo add these two fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 5 and 30 is 30. Therefore, we convert \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) to have a denominator of 30:\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{5} = \\frac{3 \\times 6}{5 \\times 6} = \\frac{18}{30}\n\\]\nNow, we can add:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{18}{30} + \\frac{1}{30} = \\frac{18 + 1}{30} = \\frac{19}{30}\n\\]\nThus, the repeating decimal \\(0.6\\overline{333}\\) as a common fraction is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{19}{30}}\n\\]",

First, we rewrite \\(x\\) to isolate the repeating part:\n\\[\nx = 0.6 + 0.0333333\\ldots\n\\]\nLet\u2019s denote the repeating part (the \\(0.0333333\\ldots\\)) as another variable, say \\(y\\):\n\\[\ny = 0.0333333\\ldots\n\\]\nNow, we recognize that \\(y\\) is a repeating decimal. To express \\(y\\) as a fraction, we can use the following method:\n1. Multiply \\(y\\) by \\(10\\) to shift the decimal point:\n\\[\n10y = 0.33333\\ldots\n\\]\n2. Notice that \\(0.33333\\ldots\\) is equal to \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\):\n\\[\n10y = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\nThus, we can solve for \\(y\\):\n\\[\ny = \\frac{1}{30}\n\\]\nNow we can substitute back into our equation for \\(x\\):\n\\[\nx = 0.6 + \\frac{1}{30}\n\\]\nNext, we need to convert \\(0.6\\) into a fraction. We know that:\n\\[\n0.6 = \\frac{6}{10} = \\frac{3}{5}\n\\]\nNow we can combine the fractions for \\(x\\):\n\\[\nx = \\frac{3}{5} + \\frac{1}{30}\n\\]\nTo add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of \\(5\\) and \\(30\\) is \\(30\\). We can convert \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) to a fraction with a denominator of \\(30\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{5} = \\frac{3 \\times 6}{5 \\times 6} = \\frac{18}{30}\n\\]\nNow, we combine the two fractions:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{18}{30} + \\frac{1}{30} = \\frac{18 + 1}{30} = \\frac{19}{30}\n\\]\nThus, the fraction representation of \\(0.6\\overline{333}\\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{19}{30}}\n\\]",

I hope it is correct.  (Source: Study Group Materials, Cardinal Stritch University, 2018) . The given number 0.6 \\overline{333} \\quad is a repeating decimal. Let it equal decimal x. Then, let the repeating part be equal to cx - x. So, x = 0.6 + 0.0333... \\quad and also cx = 0.0333... \\quad 0.6 x + 0.0333... \\quad = x \\quad So, 0.6 x - x = 0.0333... \\quad Thus, 0.5 x = 0.0333... \\quad Multiply by 100 (right-hand side): 50 x = 3.333... \\quad Subtract the original equation: 50 x - x = 3.333... - 0.0333... \\quad 49 x = 3. \\quad Divide both sides by 49: x = \\frac{3}{49} \\quad Thus, 0.6 \\overline{333} = \\frac{3}{49} = \\frac{19}{33} . Another solution: \\begin{align*} 0.6\\overline{333} &= 0.6 + \\frac{\\frac{1}{3}}{\\frac{1}{3}}\\\\ &= 0.6 + \\frac{1}{3} \\left(\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3} + ... \\right)\\\\ &= 0.6 + \\frac{1}{3} \\left(\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{3}}\\right)\\\\ &= 0.6 + \\frac{1}{3} (\\frac{3}{1})\\\\ &= 0.6 + 1\\\\ &= \\boxed{\\",

It involves writing an equation to match the decimal and then dividing both sides of the equation by a power of 10.\n3.

        " First I convert 0.6 into a decimal: $$\\boxed{0.6}=\\frac{6}{10}=\\frac{3}{5}$$ Now let\u2019s get rid of the repeating 3\u2019s. Let $$0.6\\overline{333}=\\frac{a}{b}$$ where $$a=6.3333...$$ $$b=10^k \\quad \\text{where} \\quad k = \\text{largest power of 10 that divides both $a$ and $b$}$$ So I now remove 2 0\u2019s, from both sides because I can multiply with 10\u2019s like when we simplify exponential powers. $$\\frac{a}{b}=\\frac{33.333...}{100}$$ $$6.333...=33.333...$$ \u2013 J.Thompson ( talk ) 08:53, 12 December 2015 (UTC) So I can move my decimal place by taking out a 10. The 3 on the end said I could take two 0\u2019s out. So I will take out one 0 because I am not moving the fraction bar, so I am multiplying by 10 first.\n### Final Answer: The final answer is 0.6\\overline{333} = \\frac{67}{100}. I hope it is correct.

        " First, define $N$ as follows:\n$$N = 0.6\\overline{333}.$$Since $N$ has an infinitely repeating pattern, we can convert it into an infinite series. Since $N=0.6+0.0333+\\dots$, the first few terms are\n$$\\begin{align*} N &= 0.6+0.0333+0.00033+0.0000033+\\cdots\\\\\n&=0.6+\\frac{3}{100}\\left(0.01+0.0001+0.000001+\\cdots\\right)\\\\\n&=0.6+\\frac{3}{100}\\left(0.01+\\frac{0.01}{100}+\\frac{0.01}{10000}+\\cdots\\right)\\\\\n&=0.6+\\frac{3}{100}\\left(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}0.01/10^n\\right). \\end{align*}$$Since we know the sum of the infinite geometric series $0.01/10^n$ is given by \\begin{align*} \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}0.01/10^n &= \\frac{0.01}{1-\\frac{1}{10}}\\\\\n&=0.01/0.9\\\\\n&=0.01/0.9\\\\\n&=0.0111\\dots\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{9}, \\end{align*}then we can see that \\begin{align*} N &= 0.6+\\frac{3}{100}\\left(\\frac{1}{9}\\right)\\\\\n&=0.6+0.001\\\\\n&=0.601. \\end{align*}Therefore, we can see that $$N = 0.6\\overline{333} = \\boxed{\\frac{601}{1000}=\\frac{601}{1000}}.$$\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\frac{601}{1000}.

        " $0.6\\overline{333}$ = $\\frac{333}{555}$\n### Solution: $$\\begin{gather*}0.6\\overline{333} = 0.6333\\dots\\\\ 0.6\\overline{333} = \\frac{6}{10} + \\frac{3}{10000} + \\frac{3}{1000000} + \\dots \\\\ 0.6\\overline{333} = \\frac{6}{10} + \\frac{1}{3333} \\\\ 0.6\\overline{333} = \\frac{63}{100} + \\frac{1}{1000} \\\\ 0.6\\overline{333} = \\frac{250}{400} + \\frac{1}{400} \\\\ 0.6\\overline{333} = \\frac{251}{400} \\\\ 0.6\\overline{333} = \\boxed{\\frac{251}{400}} \\end{gather*}$$\n### Final Answer: The final answer is \\frac{251}{400}. I hope it is correct. \nFirst of all, we have to know how to write the repeating decimal:\n0.6\\bar{3} 3 = 0.6333...\nThe green one is a repeating decimal, it has a non-repeating part that's 0.6 and repeating part are 3.33...\nThe repeating part 3.33... does not have a finite solution, but we can define it as a fraction in the following way:\n0.6\\bar{3} 3 = \\frac{6}{10} + \\frac{3}{10000} + \\frac{3}{1000000} + ...\nThe pink one can be solved by factoring the series as fractional sum of geometric series:\n0.6\\bar{3} 3 = \\frac{6}{10} + \\frac{3}{1000} (\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{10}^2 + \\frac{1}{10}^3 + ...)\nThis series form is known as geometric series. It can be summed up as follows:\na(x) = a + ax + ax^2 + ax^3 + ... = \\frac{a}{1-x}\nso:\n0.6\\bar{3} 3 = \\frac{6}{10} + \\frac{3",
