        "  The first step we should do is solve our system of equations, in order to find $x$ and $y$.

After doing this, we get the equation $y=-1$. This means that $y$ is equal to $-1$. We can then substitute $y$ back into one of the equations in order to find $x$.\nFor example, we can use the second equation:\n\\begin{align*}\nx+y&=1,\\\\\nx+(-1)&=1,\\\\\nx&=2.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, the solution is $x = 2$ and $y = -1$.\nWe can then use these values to compute $8x-7y$.\n$$8x-7y = 8(2)-7(-1) = 16+7=\\boxed{23}$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 23.

        " We can add the two equations to eliminate the $y$-term.\n### Step 1: Adding the two equations\nStarting with the given equations\n$$2x-y=3,\\qquad x+y=1,$$we add them to get:$$2x-y+x+y=3+1.$$Combining corresponding like terms on the left-hand side, we have$$3x=4\\Rightarrow x=\\frac{4}{3}.$$Now we have the value of $x$, we can substitute it into one of the original equations. Here, we shall use the first equation:$$2x-y=3\\Rightarrow 2\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)-y=3.$$We can rearrange this to solve for $y$:$$\\frac{8}{3}-y=3\\Rightarrow y=\\frac{8}{3}-3=\\frac{1}{3}.$$With the values of $x$ and $y$, we can now compute the answer:$$8x-7y=8\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)-7\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)=\\boxed{\\frac{22}{3}}.$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\frac{22}{3}.

        " Since we are looking for the value of an expression $8x-7y$ involving $x$ and $y$, we want to write both $x$ and $y$ in terms of one variable, say $x$.\nLooking at the equations, we can actually eliminate $y$ and solve for $x$.  We can solve the second equation for $y$, yielding $y=1-x$.  We can now substitute this value of $y$ into the first equation to obtain \\begin{align*}\n2x-y &= 3\\\\\n2x-(1-x)&=3\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 3x&=4\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x&=\\frac{4}{3}.\n\\end{align*}Now that we know $x$, we can find $y$ from the second equation.  Plugging in $x=\\frac{4}{3}$, we get $y=\\frac{1}{3}$.  Now we are ready to evaluate the desired expression.  Since $x=\\frac{4}{3}$ and $y=\\frac{1}{3}$, we have\n$$8x - 7y = 8\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)-7\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = \\boxed{\\frac{23}{3}}.$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\frac{23}{3}.

        " I can solve the equations by using the elimination method. First, I multiply the two equations by some multiples such that the coefficients of y in the two equations are the same.\n#### Option 1: $2x-y=3$ and $x+y=1$\nI will multiply $2x-y=3$ by 1 and $x+y=1$ by 2 to make the coefficients of y in the two equations the same (1). We get\n2x-y&=3 \\\\\n2x-y&=3\\\\\nx+y &=2 \\\\\nx+y &=2.\nNow, I subtract the two equations. We get $2x-2x-y+y=3-2$, which is equal to $0=1$. This is impossible, so the two equations don't have a unique solution.\n#### Option 2: $2x-y=3$ and $x+y=1$\nI will multiply $2x-y=3$ by -1 and $x+y=1$ by 2 to make the coefficients of y in the two equations the same (1). We get $-2x+y=-3$ and $2x+y=2$. Now, I add the two equations to eliminate y. We get $0x= -1$. This is impossible, so the two equations don't have a unique solution.\n#### Option 3: $2x-y=3$ and $x+y=1$\nI will multiply $2x-y=3$ by 2 and $x+y=1$ by 1 to make the coefficients of y in the two equations the same (1). We get $4x-2y=6$ and $x+y=1$. Now, I subtract the two equations to eliminate y. We get $3x-1=5$, which is the same as $3x=6$ and then $x=2$. Now, I substitute x = 2 into $x+y=1$. We get $2+y=1$ and then $y=-1$. So, x=2 and y=-1 is the solution.\n### Formula: Now that we know x=2 and y=-1, we can compute $8x-7y$. We substitute x=2 and y=-1 into the formula. We get $8x-7y = 8(2)-7(-1) = 16+7 = 23$. We are done.\n#### Answer: Next time, I will give",
        " Okay, I think I will follow your instruction!\nFrom the given equations, I have:\n2x - y = 3  ...  (Equation 1)\nx + y = 1  ...  (Equation 2)\nI want to rewrite equation (1) as: \nx = (3+y)/2\nNow, substitute this expression into equation (2):\n[(3+y)/2] + y = 1\nNow, simplify this:\n(3+y)/2 + y = 1\nCombine like terms:\n(3 + 2y)/2 = 1\nArgue with me at this level: how do we multiply both sides by 2 to isolate y?\n### Comment:\nGreat job so far! You have successfully solved for $x$ in terms of $y$ without noticing that you could solve for $y$ in terms of $x$ in a similar fashion. Instead of multiplying by 2, you should add the inverse of the left-hand side, which in this case is $-1/2$, to both sides. This will cancel out the $2$ in the denominator and give you $y$ in terms of $x$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 5. I hope it is correct. ### #x = (3+y)/2 is not wrong either. It also works. For some fun problems, I suggest trying to write y in terms of x. Why are we supplement? Because the life is more interesting that way! #### ----- This is my least confusing math discussion since a long time. I am still on the railway, get out and try to write y in terms of x. Try and write y in terms of x. Now, I will try... You substitute x from equation (1) into equation (2) to get: y + 2[(y-3)/2] = 1, which can be rearranged to: 2y - (y-3) = 1 Now, I will do that thing again. Would you like to tell me what I do? #### ",

        " The goal is to find $8x-7y$. Since $2x-y=3$, we can solve for $y$ by adding $y$ to both sides. This gives $2x-y+y=3+y$, so $2x=3+y$.
