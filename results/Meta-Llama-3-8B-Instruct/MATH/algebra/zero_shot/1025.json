        " ${6(x+2)(x+3)} = 6x(x+3) + 12(x+3) = 6x^2 + 18x + 12x + 36$\n#### Why:\nRecall the procedure of expanding a quadratic expression $ax(x+b)$ is to distribute the $a$ into the two terms: $ax(x+b) = ax^2 + abx$. So we expand each term in the product: $6(x+2)(x+3) = 6x(x+3) + 12(x+3)$.\nThe two terms in the expansion are distributed in the same way. We get two terms: $6x(x+3) = 6x^2 + 18x$ and $12(x+3) = 12x+36$.\nSo, we combine all the two terms we get: $6x^2 + 18x + 12x + 36$. \n#### Final Answer: The final answer is 6x^2+18x+12x+36.
