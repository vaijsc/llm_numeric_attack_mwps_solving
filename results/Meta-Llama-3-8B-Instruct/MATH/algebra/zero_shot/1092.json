        " \nLet $x^2 + 18x - 63 = (x - a)(x + b)$, where $a, b \\ge 0$.  This yields $x^2 + 18x - 63 = x^2 + (b - a)x - ab$, so we have $b - a = 18$ and $ab = 63$.  Since $a, b \\ge 0$, we cannot have $a = 0$.  Thus, $a > 0$, and we must have $b > 0$.  Now, $63$ is a product of two positive integers, so let\u2019s look at the positive factors of $63$: $1$ and $63$, $3$ and $21$.  Of these, $3$ and $21$ are the only two factors where one of the factors is greater than $9$, so we have $b = 21$, and $a = 3$.  The expression $x^2 + 18x - 63$ in fact factors as $(x + 21)(x - 3)$, so $\\boxed{21}$ is the value of $b$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 21. I hope it is correct.Verifier-checkbox.\n### Explanation: \nThis instruction asks to find $b$ given that the expression $x^2+18x-63$ is factored into $(x - a)(x+ b)$, where $a, b \\ge 0$. The factors of $63$ were identified as $1$ and $63$, $3$ and $21$. Based on these factors, we determined that the expression indeed factors as $(x+21)(x-3)$, so $b=\\boxed{21}$.  The other factor, $a$, corresponds to the negative factor, so $a=3$ in this situation.\nThe question ensures that $a, b \\ge 0$, which means $a$ cannot be $0$. This guarantees that $b > 0$, as we would not have a positive factor $b > 0$ without $a > 0$ in the factorization.\nThe only way to have a product of two numbers that is greater than $9$ and satisfies the requirements of the factorization is $3$ and $21$, since the sum of $1$ and $63$, $3$ and $21$ are both less than $18$. This simpl",
        " 3\nSo the expression is in the form $(x - a)(x + b)$. Expanding it, we get:\n$$(x-a)(x+b) = x^2 - ax + bx - ab$$Comparing this to the given expression, we have that $ab=-63$ and $-a+b=18$. Multiplying the second equation by $-1$, we get that $a-b=-18$. Now, we have two equations and two variables: \\begin{align*}\nab &= -63, \\\\\na-b &= -18.\n\\end{align*}From this, we can solve for $b$: $$ab=-63\\Rightarrow b=\\frac{-63}{a}.$$Substituting this into the second equation, we have: $$a-\\frac{63}{a}=-18\\Rightarrow a^2-18a+63=0.$$Factoring the quadratic, we have $$(a-9)(a-7)=0,$$so that $a=7$ or $a=9$. Since $a$ is nonnegative, it must be that $a=9$. Substituting this into $b=\\frac{-63}{a}$, we have $b=\\frac{-63}{9}=\\boxed{3}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 3. I hope it is correct.",
        " The task of factorizing a quadratic expression is factoring its quadratic formula to the form $(x + a)(x + b)$. We can do this by identifying two factors of -63 that have a sum of 18 and differ by 21, since $$x^2 + 18x - 63=(x + 9 + 7)(x + 9 - 7) = (x + 9 + 7)(x + 9 - 7) = (x + 9)(x + 7)$$It follows that $a = 9$ and $b = 7$. Therefore, $b = 7$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 7. I hope it is correct.",
        " \nStep 1: Write $x^2+18x-63$ in the form $(x-a)(x+b)$ by expanding it:\\begin{align*}\nx^2+18x-63&=(x-a)(x+b)\\\\\n&=x^2+(b-a)x-ab\n\\end{align*}This gives $b-a=18$, or $a=b-18$, and $ab=-63$.  Since $a$ and $b$ are both nonnegative, we must have $-63$ positive.  This implies $a$ and $b$ have opposite signs.  This means that $a$ must be smaller than $b$.  We then get two possible cases:\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Case 1:}\\qquad&b<18\\qquad\\qquad \\text{Case 2:}\\qquad b>18\\\\\nab=-63&\\Rightarrow\\qquad b=\\frac{-63}{a}\\\\\na&=b-18&\\Rightarrow\\qquad b\\le18\\\\\nab=-63&\\Rightarrow\\qquad \\frac{-63}{a}=b\\\\\na&=b-18&\\Rightarrow\\qquad a\\le0\n\\end{align*}Using the equations in Case 1, the smaller possible positive value of $b$ occurs when $a=1$ and $b=63$.  From this, we see $a=18-63=-45<0$, which means that this solution is impossible to obtain.\nStep 2: Notice from Case 2 that we have an inequality.  Therefore, the possible positive integer value of $b$ must satisfy the inequality\\begin{align*}\nb>18\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\, b\\le89\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\, 1\\le b\\le89\n\\end{align*}\nStep 3: Now, we can find out what are the values $b$ that work.  For $b=1$, we get $a=19>0\\Rightarrow a$ is invalid.  For $b=2$, we get $a=16>0\\Rightarrow a$ is invalid.  For $b=3$, we get $a=15>0\\Rightarrow a$ is invalid.  Finally, for",
        " We notice that the right-hand side factorization can be done as follows$$x^2+18x-63=(x+3)(x+21).$$The nonnegative real numbers are found when both factors are positive (the sum is positive) and both are negative (the sum is negative). So $a=3$ and $b=\\boxed{21}$. Hence the final answer is 21.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 21. I hope it is correct.",
