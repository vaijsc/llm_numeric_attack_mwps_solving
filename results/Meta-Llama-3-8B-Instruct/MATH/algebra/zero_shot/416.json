I hope it is correct.annies. On the basis of this observation, let $s$ be an integer such that the roots of the quadratic expression $\\frac{1}{2}x^2+sx-\\frac{1}{2}$ are integers. We can",
        " By now, you know the quadratic expression and what property you are looking for. The question asks you to find the sum of the values of s. In finding the values of s, I first used my experience to think of how to solve this problem. The process of finding the values of s. I used an equation $x = \\sqrt{2s^{2} + 2s}$. Once we find out all s\u2019 values by expanding $\\frac{1}{2}x^{2} + sx \u2013 \\frac{1}{2}$, we have the equation $x = \\sqrt{2s^{2} + 2s}$ for calculation. To find the value of s, we would then determine whether x is an integer (to fulfill the 2nd condition mentioned in the problem). By comparing the numbers and expanding, we finally got the sum of all possible values of s, which is $s = 1$ and $s = -1$, thereby $s = 0$ is solved and its sum is $(1 + (-1)) = 0$, accordingly.",
        " From here, I found a general method to guess the $s$ values.\nLet us find the $x$ values of $\\frac{1}{2}x^2+sx-\\frac{1}{2}$.  By Vieta,\n$$\\frac{1}{2}x^2+sx-\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(x+\\frac{s-\\sqrt{s^2-1}}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)\\left(x+\\frac{s+\\sqrt{s^2-1}}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right).$$We need the numerator of the each factor in second factor to be 0. Therefore, we must have $$\\frac{s+\\sqrt{s^2-1}}{\\sqrt{2}} = k \\implies s = k\\sqrt{2}-\\sqrt{s^2-1}.$$Again, we must have that the numerator of the first factor is 0. Therefore, we must have\n$$\\frac{s-\\sqrt{s^2-1}}{\\sqrt{2}} = m \\implies s = m\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{s^2-1}.$$At this point, we see that $m = k$ as they both are the root of same quadratic expression.  If we square both sides of $s = m\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{s^2-1}$, we obtain \\begin{align*}\ns^2 &= m^2\\cdot2+\\lfloor 2s^2-1\\rfloor-2\\sqrt{s^4-1}+1 \\\\\n&\\Downarrow\\\\\n2m^2+2s^2-2 &= 2ms\\sqrt{2}-4\\sqrt{s^4-1}+1 \\\\\n&\\Downarrow\\\\\n2s^2-2m^2-4\\sqrt{s^4-1}+1 &= 2ms\\sqrt{2} -4\\sqrt{s^4-1} \\\\\n&\\Downarrow\\\\\n2s^2-2m^2 &= 2ms\\sqrt{2} \\\\\n&\\Downarrow\\\\\n4s^2-4ms &= 4m^{3} \\\\\n&\\Downarrow\\\\\nm^{3}-ms &= s^2\n\\end{align*}The R.H.S. is now essentially some algebraic expression and we know that $m = \\pm s$, so we can",
        " The sum of all the possible values of $s$ is $\\boxed{1}$.\nI think I can do this.  Let\u2019s write out the quadratic formula $\\frac{1}{2}x^2+sx-\\frac{1}{2} = 0$, and use it to solve the equation for the roots.  We have $\\frac{1}{2}x^2+sx-\\frac{1}{2} = 0$, so $\\frac{1}{2}x^2+sx-\\frac{1}{2} = 0$, so $x = \\frac{-s \\pm \\sqrt{s^2-1}}{1}.$\nSince we want the solutions of this equation to be integers, we want $s^2-1$ to be a square. Let $s^2-1 = m^2$ for some integer $m$.  Solving for $s$ yields $s = \\pm \\sqrt{m^2+1}.$\nNow we can simply test our expression for all $m\\ge0$ and the corresponding values of $s$ to see what we get.  The results are $m = 0 \\rightarrow s = \\pm1$, $m = 1 \\rightarrow s = \\pm\\sqrt{2}$, $m = 2 \\rightarrow s = \\pm\\sqrt{5}$...  We can get the pattern of values if we consider $m$ to be as large as possible, since these are all of the elements of the set $\\{0,1,2,\\ldots\\}$ where $m^2$ is a square.  Also, the pieces of these patterns can be added up to $\\{ \\text{set of all } s \\text{'s}\\}.  Thus, our set of all $s$'s is the combination of the set $\\{ -\\sqrt{m^2+1}\\in\\mathbb{Z}\\}$, where the set of integers $\\mathbb{Z}$ here is only the positive integers, $s = 1$ and $s = -1$ (which is already part of our set) and $-\\sqrt{m^2+1}\\in \\mathbb{Z}$ for all $m>0$.\nThus, we can see that $\\boxed{s = 1}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 1. I hope it is correct. I also think there is another approach",
        " Step 1 - Write down the quadratic expression\n$\\begin{array}{rcl} \\frac{1}{2}x^2+sx-\\frac{1}{2} &=& x(a) \\\\ \\frac{1}{2}x^2+sx-\\frac{1}{2} &=& \\frac{1}{2}(2x^2+2sx)+(-1) \\\\ &=& \\frac{1}{2}[(2x+s)(x)]+(-1) \\\\ &=& \\frac{1}{2}(2x+s)(x)+\\frac{(-2)}{2} \\\\ &=& \\frac{(2x+s)}{2}(x)+\\frac{-1}{2} \\end{array}$",
        " \nWe want to find the roots of the quadratic expression. Therefore, we can write $P(x)=\\frac{1}{2}x^2+sx-\\frac{1}{2}$.\nIn order to get the roots of the quadratic expression, we need to factor $P(x)$ as follows:\n$$(x-a)(x-b)=0,$$where $a$ and $b$ are the roots we are looking for. To do this, we can expand the right-hand side as follows:\n$$x^2-(a+b)x+ab=x^2+sx-\\frac{1}{2}.$$By comparing coefficients, we find $a+b=s$ and $ab=-\\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe sum of roots is equal to the coefficient of $x$ which is $s$.\n### Conclusion: \nWe have the following equations: $$a+b=s$$ $$ab=-\\frac{1}{2}$$\nSince $a$ and $b$ are roots, they must also be integers, which implies $ab=\\pm1/2,\\pm2,\\pm4,\\ldots$.\nPlugging the possible values of $ab$ back to our equation, we get:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item $\\boxed{ab=-\\frac{1}{2}}$: In this case, $a$ and $b$ are opposite signs.\n$$1\\cdot (-1)=-\\frac{1}{2}\\\\s=0$$\n\\item $\\boxed{ab=1}$: In this case, either $a$ and $b$ are both positive or both negative.\n$$a=1, b=1; s=2$$\n$$a=-1, b=-1; s=-2$$\n\\item $\\boxed{ab=-2}$: In this case, one of the roots is positive and one of the roots is negative.\n$$a=2, b=-1; s=1$$\n$$a=-2, b=1; s=-1$$\n\\end{itemize}\nTherefore, the sum of all possible values of $s$ is $\\boxed{0+2+(-2)+1+(-1)=0}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 0.
