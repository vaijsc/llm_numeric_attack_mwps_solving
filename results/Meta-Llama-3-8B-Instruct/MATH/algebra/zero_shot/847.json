        " Step 1: Find the formula given the linear relationship. In this problem, we can find the formula using the two pairs of points. The given point is (20, 30) means the time is 20 seconds and the distance is 30 meters. So, we can write an equation: $$y=mx+c$$\nWhere m is the slope and c is the constant. We can find the slope by calculating m = y2 / x2 - y1 / x1. Note: (x2, y2) and (x1, y1) are the two points given. In this case, (x2, y2) = (20, 30) and (x1, y1) can be arbitrary, say (0, 0). So, m = (30 - 0) / (20 - 0) = 3/2. The formula is simplified to y = (3/2)x + c.\nStep 2: Find the value of c. To find the value of c, we can use the point (20, 30) and substitute them into the formula: 30 = 3/2 (20) + c => c = 30 - 3*10 = 0.\nStep 3: Write the final equation. Now we have the formula: y = (3/2)x. Let\u2019s see if the equation makes sense, checking if the point (20, 30) indeed belongs to the line. It does, and the equation seems correct.\nStep 4: Find the distance after one hour. We want to find the distance after one hour, so we have to find the distance given x = 60 minutes or 3600 seconds. Substituting x = 3600 into the formula, we get y = (3/2) * 3600 = 5400/2 = 2700.\nSo, Caroline will walk 2700 meters in exactly one hour. I hope that is correct. Please guide me if I am wrong.

        " First, we identify the equation of the line. Recall the slope-intercept form of a line: $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope, and $b$ is the y-intercept. We have a point on the graph, $(20,30)$, so we can find the slope: $\\frac{30-0}{20-0}=1.5$ The slope is 1.5. We are told the line is given by $y=1.5x$, so we identify the intercept. Since the line passes through $(20,30)$, which happens to be on the line, we can plug these values in for $x$ and $y$: $$\\begin{array}{rcl}\n30&=&1.5(20)\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad30&=&30.\n\\end{array}$$Thus, the $y$-intercept is $b=0$, and the equation of the line is $y=1.5x$. Now, we can solve the question. We want to know how many meters will Caroline walk in exactly one hour. One hour is $60$ minutes, so we multiply $60$ by the slope, $1.5$, to get the distance she walks in that time. $60\\cdot 1.5=\\boxed{90}$ meters. So, we know that she will walk $90$ meters in one hour.",

        " This graph shows a linear relationship between $x$ and $y$, which means that the distance Caroline is from the starting point grows at a constant rate, measured in meters per second.

        " There are a few ways to do this problem, but one way is to notice that $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the $y$-intercept. From the graph, we see that the slope is $1.5$ and the $y$-intercept is $0$ because it crosses the $x$-axis at the origin. To find the length of 60 minutes (which is $60 \\times 60 = 3600$ seconds), we plug in $3600$ for $x$.

We want to find $y$ meters when she walks $x = 3600$ seconds which is equivalent to one hour.\nNow, we can plug in $x = 3600$ into the equation. We get the distance $y$ as $1.5(3600) = \\boxed{15\\text{m}}$.\nNow, if you see the graph, it is easy to get the distance. ### Hint:\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 15. I hope it is correct. (The graph tells us that Caroline walks 90 meters in 60 seconds. Therefore, she walks 1800 meters in 360 seconds, or 1/2 hour, which gives us a distance of 3600 meters for 1 hour, and therefore $1.5\\times 3600 = 15\\times 60 = \\boxed{15}$ meters at the end of that hour. Since the graph does not hit the axis at 0,010), we cannot solve the equation of the line. Given the point on the line, we can describe the line as (11, 15, 1.5). We can use this equation of the line to get the value of 1 and we get y = 1.5x. Thus, if we want to find y for one hour, which is 3600 seconds, or 360 seconds, we have the equation y = 1.5(3600) = 5400.
