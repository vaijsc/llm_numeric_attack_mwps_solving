        "To determine when Connie will first do more than 100 sit-ups in one day, we can follow these steps:\n1. **Initial Sit-ups and Increment**: \n   - Connie starts with 25 sit-ups on June 1.\n   - Each day, she increases the number of sit-ups by 4.\n2. **Setting up the formula**: \n   The number of sit-ups she does on day \\( n \\) can be represented as:\n   \\[\n   S(n) = 25 + 4(n - 1)\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( S(n) \\) is the number of sit-ups on day \\( n \\), and \\( n \\) is the day of June (where \\( n = 1 \\) for June 1, \\( n = 2 \\) for June 2, and so on).\n3. **Finding when \\( S(n) > 100 \\)**:\n   We want to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that:\n   \\[\n   25 + 4(n - 1) > 100\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this:\n   \\[\n   4(n - 1) > 100 - 25\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   4(n - 1) > 75\n   \\]\n   Now divide both sides by 4:\n   \\[\n   n - 1 > 18.75\n   \\]\n   Adding 1 to both sides gives:\n   \\[\n   n > 19.75\n   \\]\n4. **Finding the smallest integer**:\n   Since \\( n \\) must be a whole number (a day), the smallest integer greater than 19.75 is 20. Thus, we need to find \\( n = 20 \\).\n5. **Determining the date**:\n   The 20th day of June is June 20.\n6. **Verification**:\n   Let's check how many sit-ups she does on June 20:\n   \\[\n   S(20) = 25 + 4(20 - 1) = 25 + 4(19) = 25 + 76 = 101\n   \\]\n   This confirms that on June 20 Connie will do 101 sit-ups, which is indeed more than 100.\nTherefore, the first date during the month of June when Connie will do more than 100 sit-ups in one day is **June 20**.",

        " The first date in June is June 1, so we will start counting from there. On June 1, the number of sit-ups is 25. Now let\u2019s figure out how many 24s are in the number. 100 - 25 is 75, which is 3 * 24 + 3. So on June 4, we will get 25 + 4 * 3 = 25 + 12 = 37. 100 - 37 is 63, which is 2 * 31 + 3. So on June 8, we will get 25 + 4 * 4 = 25 + 16 = 41. So on June 8, we will still be less than 100 sit-ups.\nSolution looks good. The next step would be to find out when we first go above 100 sit-ups.\n100 - 41 = 59, which is 2 * 29 + 1. So on June 12, we will get 25 + 4 * 5 = 25 + 20 = 45. 100 - 45 is 55, which is 55. So on June 12, we will still be less than 100 sit-ups.\nLet\u2019s try the next day, June 13.\n100 - 49 is 51, which is 51. So on June 13, we will still be less than 100 sit-ups.\nLet\u2019s try the next day, June 14.\n100 - 52 is 48, which is 48.

        " To do more than 100 sit-ups on a date in June, Connie\u2019s number of sit-ups must be greater than 100 on that date.\nThis means that if Connie does x sit-ups on the day after June 1, she must have done at least 104 sit-up on that day. This also implies that the number of sit-ups before that day must be 100.\nLet\u2019s create a table to help us solve the problem. (Table 1)\n| Date | Number of Sit-ups |\n| --- | --- |\n| June 1 | 25 |\n| June 2 | 25 + 4 = 29 |\n| June 3 | 29 + 4 = 33 |\n| June 4 | 33 + 4 = 37 |\n| June 5 | 37 + 4 = 41 |\n| June 6 | 41 + 4 = 45 |\n| June 7 | 45 + 4 = 49 |\n| June 8 | 49 + 4 = 53 |\n| June 9 | 53 + 4 = 57 |\n| June 10 | 57 + 4 = 61 |\n| June 11 | 61 + 4 = 65 |\n| June 12 | 65 + 4 = 69 |\n| June 13 | 69 + 4 = 73 |\n| June 14 | 73 + 4 = 77 |\n| June 15 | 77 + 4 = 81 |\n| June 16 | 81 + 4 = 85 |\n| June 17 | 85 + 4 = 89 |\n| June 18 | 89 + 4 = 93 |\n| June 19 | 93 + 4 = 97 |\n| June 20 | 97 + 4 = 101 |\n| June 21 | 101 + 4 = 105 |",
        " \nShe will start with 25 sit-ups on June 1. Between June 1 and June 30, she will do:\n25, 29, 33, ..., 103\nIf she does 29 sit-ups, because 25 + 4 = 29.\nIf she does 33 sit-ups, because 29 + 4 = 33.\nIf she does 37 sit-ups, because 33 + 4 = 37.\n.\n.\n.\nIf she does 103 sit-ups, because 99 + 4 = 103.\nShe will do 103 sit-ups for the first time on:\nJune 15. Because June 14 will be \n25, 29, 33, ..., 99;",
        " This problem would require us to know the definition of the term \"four more than\" and that 6 * 4 = 24. So the question is saying how long it would take her to eat more than 100 sit-ups. So we would take 25 + 4, 25 + 8, 25 + 12, ... all the way to 24 + 100 (which is the hundredth four more than 25). So looking at 25 + 4 + 8 + 12 = 49. 25 + 8 + 12 + 16 = 61. 25 + 12 + 16 + 20 = 73. 25 + 16 + 20 + 24 = 85. 25 + 20 + 24 + 28 = 97. 25 + 24 + 28 + 32 = 109. 109 is more than 100. So the answer is June 24th. To find the answer, I simply looked for how long it would take her to do 100 sit-ups by adding 4 each time until I got an answer of 100.\nCategories:\n- 2nd 4 weeks: 2.13%\n- Education: 2.13%\n- Exercise: 2.13%\n- Fitness: 2.13%\n- Health: 2.13%\n- Medical: 2.13%\n- Mentoring: 2.13%\n- Skills: 2.13%\n- Wellness: 2.13%\nLast Refreshed: NULL\nLast Updated: NULL\nID: #821408\nViewed: 0xIO.\n",
        " We are looking for the first day on which her total number of sit-ups is more than 100. \nSince she will start with 25 sit-ups, we will add 4 to this number for each day.\nLet\u2019s see how quickly we reach 100:\n25(1) = 25\n29(2) = 29 + 4 = 33\n33(3) = 33 + 4 = 37\n41(4) = 41 + 4 = 45\n49(5) = 49 + 4 = 53\n57(6) = 57 + 4 = 61\n65(7) = 65 + 4 = 69\n73(8) = 73 + 4 = 77\n81(9) = 81 + 4 = 85\n89(10) = 89 + 4 = 93\n97(11) = 97 + 4 = 101\nSo we are looking for the 12th day of the month because the number of sit-ups will reach 101 on the 12th day. \nFinal Answer: The final answer is June 12. I hope it is correct.  #### Final Answer: The final answer is June 12. I hope it is correct.### "
