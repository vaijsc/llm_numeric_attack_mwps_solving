        " 6.1 seconds\nWe want the projectile to reach 77 feet, which tells us that 77 is equal to -6t^2 + 43t. Let's isolate the t term (since that's what we're looking for). First, we want to get the t term by itself. We do this by moving the constant term (77) to one side of the equation. This gives us $6t^2 - 43t + 77 = 0.$\nNow, let's think of this a bit differently. We can write $6t^2 - 43t + 77 = (6t - 1)(t - 77).$ To factored the polynomial, we need to get two binomials of the form $(Pt + Q)(Rt + S)$ to multiply together, and we have both of those by inspection.\n### Steps to solve:\nJust to make sure it's right, we can multiply this out:\n$$(6t - 1)(t - 77) = 6t^2 - 457t + 77.$$That simplifies to $6t^2 - 43t + 77 = 0.$ We have got $6t^2 - 43t + 77 = 0$ with the factored form. So we're just left to find zeroes of this factored polynomial.\n### Find the zeroes of the factored polynomial\nThe zeroes of the factored polynomial are the roots of the polynomial, namely -1/6 and 77. $-1/6$ is not an integer, and neither is $77,$ but then since they're both real numbers, we just need to find decimal approximations of each of them. This can be done using a calculator, and if you don't have one, we also can try doing it on a computer.\nIn this case, we say $-1/6$ is approximately -0.16667 (or just -0.2), while $77$ is approximately $77.0000.$ Then, if those numbers (which we now have as decimal approximations) are real numbers, we simply pick the one in question and that'll provide the solutions. Since 6.1 is an approximation of 77, it is the answer. The other solution is $-1/6$ which is an approximation of -0.16667, which is less than zero, therefore we don't take it into account when we're far",

        " \nIf we use the general method of setting $y = -6t^2 + 43t$ and then solving for $t$, we can easily solve for the value of $t$ when the projectile first reaches 77 feet in height.\nWe can solve the equation by setting $77 = -6t^2 + 43t$ and then solving for $t$.\nFirst, add 6 to both sides, which leaves us with $83 = -6t^2 + 43t$.\nNext, we need to add 9 (the square of 3, which is less than 43) to both sides.\n$83 + 9 = -6t^2 + 43t + 9$.\nNow we have: $92 = -6t^2 + 43t + 9$.\nNow subtract $43t + 9$ from both sides, leaving us with $92 - 43t - 9 = -6t^2$.\nThis simplifies to:\n$83 = -6t^2 + 43t$.\nThis equation is now in the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, which has a solution given by the quadratic formula.\n$t = \\frac{-43 \\pm \\sqrt{(843^2 - 4(6)(83)}} {12}$.\nIn this case, we are asked for the time at which the projectile first reaches 77 feet in height. Thus, we only need to solve for the positive root of the quadratic equation.\n$$t = \\frac{-43 + \\sqrt{(43^2 - 4(6)(83)}} {12} = \\frac{-43 + \\sqrt{(41)(433)}} {12}$$. Simplifying further, we obtain:\n$$t = \\frac{-43 + 31}} {12}$$. Evaluating this, we get $t = \\frac{2}{12}$, which is equivalent to $\\boxed{0.2}$ seconds.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 0.2.

        " \nThe projectile is initially on Mars, which is 0 feet above sea level. So $y_0=0$. After some thought, or by working on the problem, we know that $y=-6t^2 + 43t$. So, we need to find out when $y=77$. \n$-6t^2+43t-77=0$.\n### Applying Quotient-remainder Theorem:\nThe above equation can be solved using the Quadratic Formula $\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$ which is $\\frac{-43\\pm\\sqrt{1449}}{12}$.\n$y = \\frac{-43+\\sqrt{1449}}{12}$\n$y = \\frac{-43-15.2}{12}$\n$y = -4.5333$\n$y = 5.7667$\nThere is a solution with real part that is positive. So the equation has only one root.\n$y = 2.7667$\nHowever, it doesn\u2019t have the right units, because it is in seconds. So we divide by 43 instead of taking the square root.\n$y = 2$\nSo we will have to use either linear equation y = mx +c or quadratic equation. The equation -6t^2 + 43t - 77 = 0 is a quadratic equation. So we will use the Quadratic Formula.\n$\\frac{-43\\pm\\sqrt{1449}}{12}$\n$\\frac{-43+15.2}{12}$\n$\\frac{-43}{12}+1.2667$\n$\\frac{-27.6}{12}+\\frac{15.2}{12}$\n$2.2333$\nSo the equation -6t^2 + 43t - 77 = 0 is solved when t = 2.7667. We can\u2019t use this as a solution. We have t = 2 and we have to solve for t.\n$-6t^2+43t-77=0$\n$t=\\frac{43\\pm\\sqrt{43^2-4(-6)(-77)}}{2(-6)}$\n$t=\\frac{-43\\pm\\sqrt{1849}}{12}$\n$t=\\frac{-43+\\sqrt{1849}}{12}$\n$t=\\frac{43-15.2}{12}$\n$t=\\frac{43}{12",
        " Since we need to find a value of t such that y = 77, we need to solve $-6t^2+43t=77$ for $t$. We can solve this quadratic equation by completing the square: $$-6t^2+43t=77\\Rightarrow t^2-\\frac{43}{6}t+\\frac{77}{6}=0.$$ Completing the square, we get $$\\left(t-\\frac{43}{2}\\right)^2=169/12.$$ Taking square roots and solving for $t$, we find that\n$$t-\\frac{43}{2}=\\pm\\frac{\\sqrt{169}}{2\\sqrt{3}}=\\pm\\frac{13}{2\\sqrt{3}}.$$ Therefore, $t$ is equal to $$t=\\frac{43}{2}\\pm\\frac{13}{2\\sqrt{3}}.$$ Simplifying and solving for $\\sqrt{3}$, we find that the time in which the projectile first reaches 77 feet is $\\boxed{t=6.8}\\approx 6.8$ seconds.\nPreviously edited\n#### The correct solution\nLet\u2019s think step by step.\n### ",

To find out when the projectile reaches 77 feet in distance, we substitute that value for $y$:\n\\begin{align*}\n77 &= -6t^2 + 43t \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 0 &= 6t^2 - 43t + 77 \\\\\n&= 2t^2 - 7t + 19.5\n\\end{align*}\nUsing the quadratic formula, we can solve for $t$:$$t = \\frac{-(-7)\\pm\\sqrt{49-4(2)(19.5)}}{4} = \\frac{7\\pm3\\sqrt{5}}{4}.$$\nSince $t$ cannot be negative, we choose the positive square root, which yields\n$$t = \\frac{7+3\\sqrt{5}}{4}.$$Therefore, the projectile first reaches 77 feet in height after $t = \\boxed{1.3}$ seconds.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 1.3.

        " \nWe want $y=77$, which means that\n$-6t^2+43t=77.$Solving for $t$, we get\n\\begin{align*}\n-6t^2+43t&=77\\\\\n-6t^2+43t-77&=0\\\\\n-6(t^2-7t+\\frac{77}{6})&=0\\\\\n(t-\\frac{7}{6})^2(\\right.-6)&=0\\\\\n(t-\\frac{7}{6})^2&=0\\\\\nt-\\frac{7}{6}&=0\\\\\nt&=\\boxed{\\frac{7}{6}}.\n\\end{align*}The projectile reaches a height of 77 feet after $\\frac{7}{6}=1.2$ seconds.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 1.2. I hope it is correct.",
        " The desired time $t$ satisfies the equation $77 = -6t^2 + 43t$. Rearranging terms gives $6t^2-43t+77=0$, or $(3t-11)(2t-7)=0$, so either $t=11/3$ or $t=7/2$. In a real-world context, a projectile release at the surface of Mars will have initial velocity $43$ feet per second downwards (since this is a downward acceleration), so it is negative, not positive. So we find the value of $t$ that is negative. We find that $7/2$ is positive, so we just need to round down to $t = 3.5$. Therefore, in $\\boxed{\\text{3.5 seconds}}$, the projectile reaches 77 feet in height.\n#### Answer: The final answer is 3.5. I hope it is correct. ##### Real Analysis Review: Finding Solutions of Equations Solving quadratic equations by factoring. Review: Solving quadratic equations can be done by factoring (if possible). In this problem, the equation was $$6t^2-43t+77=0.$$ To factor this equation, we need to find two numbers whose product is $77$ and whose sum is $-43$. These two numbers are $11$ and $7$, so we can factor as follows: $$6t^2-43t+77 = \\boxed{(3t-11)(2t-7) = 0}.$$ Solving this equation for $t$ involves setting each factor equal to $0$ and solving for $t$: $$3t-11 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad t=\\frac{11}{3}$$ $$2t-7 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad t = \\frac{7}{2}.$$ We need to find the solution that is negative, so we choose $t = \\frac{11}{3} = 3.67$. (Note that if you were solving the problem using the quadratic formula, you would also get these two solutions as well.)\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 3.5. I hope it is correct. ##### FAQs: \n-What is the equation of a projectile?\n-What is the height of a projectile?\n-The equation of a projectile is $y = -6t^2 + 43t$.\n-The height of a projectile is described by the equation",
        " \nLet's think step by step.\nLet $t$ be the time (in seconds) when the projectile first reaches 77 feet in height. Then, we need to set $y=77$ and solve for $t$: \\begin{align*}\n-6t^2 + 43t&=77\\\\\n-6t^2 + 43t - 77&=0.\n\\end{align*}If we solve this equation, we get two solutions: $$t=\\frac{43\\pm\\sqrt{43^2-4(-6)(-77)}}{2(-6)}=\\frac{43\\pm\\sqrt{2521}}{-12},$$which can be simplified to $$t=\\frac{43+\\sqrt{2521}}{-12}\\approx 1.4 \\quad\\text{or}\\quad t=\\frac{43-\\sqrt{2521}}{-12}\\approx 3.6.$$Since the projectile first reaches 77 feet in height at $t\\approx 1.4$ seconds, our answer is $\\boxed{1.4}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 1.4. I hope it is correct."
