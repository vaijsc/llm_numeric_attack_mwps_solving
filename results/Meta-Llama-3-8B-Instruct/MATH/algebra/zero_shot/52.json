        " Let\u2019s say that our first term is $a = 1000$.  We know that the second term is 987, so we know the difference needed to get to this term.

Let\u2019s think of an equation that represents our sequence.  This sequence is arithmetic because every term is the previous term minus 13.  To represent it, we can use: $a, ~a+d, ~a+2d, ~a+3d, ~\\ldots$  So, we have a formula for terms beyond our first term: $a_n = a + (n-1)d = a + (n-1)(-13)$.  We are asked for the least term.

The next term after $948$ will be $948-13 = 935$, and so on.\nTo find the least positive integer in the sequence, we start with $1000$ and subtract $13$ repeatedly:\n\\begin{align*}\n1000-13 & = 987\\\\\n987-13 & = 974\\\\\n974-13 & = 961\\\\\n961-13 & = 948\\\\\n948-13 & = \\boxed{935}\n\\end{align*}\nTherefore, the least positive integer in the sequence is $\\boxed{935}$.

        " 946\nWe note that the arithmetic sequence has a constant difference between successive terms, namely, the constant difference is $13$.  So, we are looking for an integer $n$ such that\n$$974 + 13n = 946.$$We now subtract $974$ from each side and add $13n$ to both sides, so we get:\n$$13n = \\boxed{-28}.$$Now, since the difference is $13$ and the $n$th-term is $946$, our sequence looks like: $1000,~nhalorecent(1003)$. Replace the following with the parentheses text: dh More\nGiven information:\n    - The given arithmetic sequence is $1000, 987, 974, 961, \\ldots$.\n    - The least positive integer value of $n$ is what we are looking for.\nArithmetic sequence definition:\n    - In an arithmetic sequence, the constant difference between successive terms is called the common difference.\nCalculations:\n    - Let $d$ be the common difference.\n    - $d = 1000 - 987 = 13$\n    - $d = 987 - 974 = 13$\n    - $d = 974 - 961 = 13$\n    - From the description, we see that $d = 13$ for all terms.\n    - The sequence is $1000, 1000 + 13, 1000 + 2 \\cdot 13, 1000 + 3 \\cdot 13, \\ldots$\n    - Using the formula $a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d$, we find that $974 + 13n = 1000 + 13(n - 1) = 946$.\n    - Subtracting $1000$ from both sides, we get $13n = -54$.\n    - Dividing both sides by $13$, we find that $n = \\frac{-54}{13} = \\boxed{-4}$\n    - Thus, the value $946$ in the given series indicates that $n = -4$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 946.

        " Our sequence $1000, ~987, ~974, ~961, \\ldots,$ is an arithmetic sequence because each term is $13$ less than the previous term.  To find the next term, we subtract $13$ from $974$ to get $961.$  We can continue this process to find other terms in the sequence.\n### Step 2\nWe can continue this process to find other terms in the sequence, and we see that we will reach infinity because positive integers can always be decreased by any positive number to reach another positive integer.  However, we need to find the \\textit{least} positive integer in the sequence.\n### Step 3\nSo we need to keep going until we reach a term that we \\textbf{do not decrease} and another term that is \\textbf{one more} than that.  The first number that will meet this criteria is $\\boxed{941.}$\n### Final Answer: The final answer is 941. I hope it is correct.  If not, please help me to solve it further. Thank you.  A solution which is not unexpected.  The pattern $1000, ~987, ~974, ~961, \\ldots,$ is a descending arithmetic sequence.  We are looking for the next positive integer which will be part of this sequence, hence $937.$  We will check if the pattern is correct. $937-13 = 924$ which is part of the sequence, thus our answer is $937.$ Final Answer: The final answer is 937. I hope it is correct.  Please correct me if i made a mistake. Thank you. Thank you for your help.\nThis is a cleverly posed problem. The solution should not involve algebra or complex calculations, but the question still seems to require some level of mathematical maturity. We provide a variety of approaches, from different levels of mathematical sophistication.\n[Source: 2014 AMC 12A, ",
