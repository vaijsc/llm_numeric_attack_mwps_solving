        " \nLet the center of that circle be $(2,3)$. Since the circle passes through $(-1,6)$, that point must satisfy the equation of the circle.

Like that. and there this ain\u2019t ready yet. What it means? Because, next year that\u2019s gonna be. Ayah. That\u2019s how we do. And do not do. Anymore. Just you go! Magic Show",
        " \nNote that the center of the circle is $(2,3)$, and we also know that the circle passes through the point $(-1,6)$.  \nSo we can use the distance formula. The distance between two points $a=(a_1,a_2)$ and $b=(b_1,b_2)$ is $$d(a,b)=\\sqrt{(b_1-a_1)^2+(b_2-a_2)^2}.$$So the distance from the point $(-1,6)$ to the center $(2,3)$ is \n\\begin{align*}\nd(-1,6),(2,3)&=\\sqrt{(2-(-1))^2+(3-6)^2}\\\\\n&=\\sqrt{9+9}\\\\\n&=\\sqrt{18}\\\\\n&=3\\sqrt{2}.\n\\end{align*}\nSo the equation of the circle is \n$$(x-2)^2+(y-3)^2=9\\cdot 2=18.$$\nThen, let\u2019s rewrite the equation by completing the square in both $x$ and $y$ variables:\n\\begin{align*}\n(x-2)^2+(y-3)^2&=18\\\\\nx^2-4x+4+y^2-6y+9&=18\\\\\nx^2-4x+4+y^2-6y+9&=18\\\\\nx^2-4x+y^2-6y&=5.\n\\end{align*}\nThen, we can group terms with $x$ and $y$ separately. \n$$x^2-4x+y^2-6y+5=0$$\nAnd now, we can easily calculate the value of $A\\times B\\times C$:\n\\begin{align*}\nA\\times B\\times C&=(-4)\\times(-6)\\times5\\\\\n&=\\boxed{120}\n\\end{align*}\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 120.

        " (type your answer here, then submit). ((your answer should be an integer, or the numerical value of the product of three integers.).\nThe circle has the form $(x-2)^2 + (y-3)^2 = r^2$. Since it passes through $(-1,6)$, we can plug that into the equation and solve for $r^2$:\n\\begin{align*}\n(-1-2)^2 + (6-3)^2 &= r^2 \\\\\n9 + 9 &= r^2 \\\\\nr^2 &= 18\n\\end{align*} Therefore, the equation is $(x-2)^2 + (y-3)^2 = 18$. Expanding this out, we find that \\begin{align*}\nx^2 - 4x + 4 + y^2 - 6y + 9 &= 18 \\\\\nx^2 - 4x + y^2 - 6y &= 5 \\\\\nx^2 + y^2 - 4x - 6y - 5 &= 0\n\\end{align*}So $A = -4$, $B = -6$, and $C = -5$, and $A \\times B \\times C = \\boxed{-120}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -120.
