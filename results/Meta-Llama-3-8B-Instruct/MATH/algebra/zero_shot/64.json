It\u2019s nice to read this instruction given by you.\nThank you! This is a good question. It is useful to think about these problems one step at a time, as I did. To break it down: I started by using PEMDAS. I knew that I had to evaluate the exponential part first, and then the cube root. Therefore, I ended up with $\\left(2^4\\right)^{\\frac 13} (a^{\\frac 23})^{\\frac 13}$ = $2$ $a^{\\frac 23}$. But I knew that $a=8$, so I could then replace $a$ with 8 to get 2 $8^{\\frac 23}$ = 2 * 2 = 4. Since the problem is asking for the value of $\\left(16\\sqrt[3]{a^2}\\right)^{\\frac 13}$, and the value of the expression inside the parentheses is 4, then I could then evaluate the exponential part one more time to get 4^{\\frac 13} = 2. So, the final answer is 2. I will make sure to use more spaces in the future to provide a more readable format for the problem. Thank you for your feedback.\nI would like to let you know that using the expression in between parentheses helped me, the reader, understand the problem better.

This way, I could also understand the problem and arrive at the same answer. Your way of presenting the problem was really helpful and easy to comprehend.\nThank you for your feedback! The format is important to me, and I appreciate your suggestion to use more spaces and the expression in between parentheses. It helped me to be more clear in my previous response. When I solve problems, I want to encourage clarity and coherence, and I believe that it will help to make complex problems more accessible. I'm glad you appreciate the step",
