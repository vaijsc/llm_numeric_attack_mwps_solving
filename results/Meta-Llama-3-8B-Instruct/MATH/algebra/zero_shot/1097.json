        " Robert want to build a rectangular plot of land of at least 500 square feet with minimal fencing. \n**\n#### ",
        " To minimize the amount of fencing, we want the longest possible length of fencing with the least possible ends (two). One way to do this is to create a rectangle with the smallest length and the most width. Let the length be L, and the width be W. Since Robert wants the width to be 5 ft longer than the length, we know that W = L + 5. Since the plot has to be 500 sq ft, the area has to be at least 500.\nThe area A of a rectangle is given by A = L \u00d7 W. Plug in W = L + 5:\nA = L \u00d7 (L + 5)\nOpen up the term inside the parentheses:\nA = L\u00b2 + 5L\nWe know that A \u2265 500, so:\nL\u00b2 + 5L \u2265 500\nSubtract 500 from both sides:\nL\u00b2 + 5L - 500 \u2265 0\nFactor the left side:\n(L + 25)(L - 20) \u2265 0\nThis inequality is satisfied when either L + 25 \u2265 0 (i.e., L \u2265 -25) or L - 20 \u2265 0 (i.e., L \u2265 20).\nThe length cannot be negative, so we have L \u2265 20. This means that the smallest length is 20 feet.\nThe width is W = L + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25 feet.\nThe width of the plot is 25 ft.### Correct!#### 2.75 / 0.9 = ?#### ",

Based on L \\le 25 and W \\le 30, we use L = 25 and W = 30 to minimize total fencing.\n#### Total fencing = 2(25) + 2(30) = 100\n#### So, the fencing used is 100 ft.\n#### To minimize fencing while using the least amount of fencing possible, the width of the fence is 30 ft.\n### End of solution\nThe width of the plot is 30 ft. Let's review the steps to get the answer:\n1. Define L as the length and W as the width.\n2. Define W as L + 5.\n3. Ensure the plot is at least 500 square feet by solving L^2 + 5L - 500 \\ge 0.\n4. Find the boundary values for L (L \\le 25) and W (W \\le 30).\n5. To minimize fencing, use the most restrictive values: L = 25 and W = 30.\n6. Calculate the total fencing used: 2L + 2W = 100.",
        " \nWe use the formula for the area of a rectangle to relate the length and width:\nA = lw\n500 = lw\nSince the width is 5 ft longer than the length, let the length be x and the width be x + 5. The equation becomes:\n500 = x(x + 5)\nWe can expand the equation:\n500 = x^2 + 5x\nx^2 + 5x - 500 = 0\nFactor the quadratic:\n(x - 15)(x + 20) = 0\nx = 15 or x = -20\nTo satisfy the requirement that the width is at least 5 ft longer than the length, we take x = 15. The corresponding width is:\nx + 5 = 20\nSo, the width of the plot is **20 feet**.####\n",
        " Variable: length and width; constraints: 500$: required, width = length + 5; equations: 2 variables and 2 equations, easy to solve. Let\u2019s learn step by step.

Then solve for the length; square footage = length * (length + 5); square footage = length * length + 5 * length; square footage - length * length = 500; 5 * length - 500 + length * length = 0 Combining the terms: length^2 + 5 * length - 500 = 0 Move the terms to the right-hand side, which is a standard form for a linear equation. Square both sides: (length + 20)^2 - 400 = 0 Add 400 to both sides: (length + 20)^2 = 400 Simplify by taking the square root: length + 20 = \u00b1(20); length + 20 = 20 or length + 20 = -20 For simplicity, take the positive root: length + 20 = 20; length = 0.

        " \nStep 1: \nThe total perimeter of the rectangle is given by P = 2l + 2w, where l is the length and w is the width. Since the width is 5 ft longer than the length, w = l + 5.\nStep 2: \nThe area of the rectangle is given by A = l \u00d7 w = l \u00d7 (l + 5) = l^2 + 5l.\nSince Robert wants the plot to be at least 500 square feet, we can write the inequality 500 \u2264 l^2 + 5l.\nStep 3: \nWe need to minimize the perimeter while satisfying the area constraint. Let\u2019s try to eliminate the absolute value symbols in the formula P = 2l + 2w:\nP = 2l + 2w = 2l + 2(l+5) = 4l + 10\nNow, we have an expression for the perimeter without absolute values.\nStep 4: \nWe need to find the minimum value of P when the area constraint is satisfied. We can do this by taking the derivative of P with respect to l and setting it equal to zero:\n4l + 10 = 0\nSubtracting 10 from both sides, we get:\n4l = -10\nDividing both sides by 4, we get:\nl = -10/4 = -2.5\nSince l cannot be negative, this value does not satisfy the constraint. So, we need to find another way.\nStep 5: \nWe can use the fact that P is a linear function and the area constraint is quadratic. To minimize P, we can use the vertex formula:\nl = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\nIn our case, P = 4l + 10, a = 4, b = 0, and c = 10. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\nl = (0 \u00b1 \u221a(0^2 - 4 * 4 * 10)) / (2 * 4)\n= (0 \u00b1 \u221a(-80)) / 8\n= (0 \u00b1 2i\u221a10) / 8\nThis expression has imaginary solutions, which means that our rectangle would have to be invisible!\nSo, we conclude that it is impossible to find a feasible solution that satisfies the area constraint and minimizes the perimeter.\nHowever, we can try to find an",

We solve the quadratic equation to get L = 15 or L = 20. Checking L = 15 gives W*L = 80, which is less than 500 so this is not a valid solution. L = 20 gives W*L = 500, so this is the correct solution. Always check the posible solutions.\nIt's time to get back to work! You have finished with the problem.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 20.

        " \nLet L and W be the length and width of the plot, respectively. Because the width is 5 longer than the length, we have W = L + 5.\nNow, the area of the plot is L x W = L x (L + 5). We want this area to be at least 500. So, L(L + 5) >= 500. We want to use the least amount of fencing possible, so we want the perimeter P = 2L + 2W = 2L + 2(L + 5) to be as small as possible.\nWe can simplify the expression for the perimeter as: P = 4L + 10.\nNotice that L(L + 5) is a quadratic expression. We can complete the square to factor it as: L^2 + 5L = (L + 5/2)^2 - 25/4.\nWe know the area must be at least 500. This means (L + 5/2)^2 - 25/4 >= 500. This quadratic inequality is equivalent to (L + 5/2 - sqrt(500 + 25/4))^2 <= 0. This inequality implies L < -2.5 + sqrt(625) or L > -2.5 - sqrt(625).\nL > -2.5 - sqrt(625) implies L > -10, since sqrt(625) = 25. Since L >= 0, we have L > 0.\nL < -2.5 + sqrt(625) implies L < -2.5 + 25. This can be simplified to L < 22.5, since -2.5 + 25 = 22.5.\nSo, we have 0 < L < 22.5. Now, we want to minimize P = 4L + 10. The minimum occurs when L = 22.5. Since we want W = L + 5, we have W = 22.5 + 5 = 27.5.\nSo, the width of the plot is $\\boxed{27.5}$ feet. \u043d\u0435\u0437\u0430\u043a\n#### Related Topics\nThis question is similar to the one about a rectangle with a given perimeter and area.
