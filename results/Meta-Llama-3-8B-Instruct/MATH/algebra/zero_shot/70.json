        " Using the given information\nSince $(x,y) = (3,9)$, we can plug in $x=3$ and $y=9$ for any expression that we encounter. In this case, we see that we have $y^2 - 3xy + 8$ and we can plug in $x=3$ and $y=9$ to get $$9^2-3\\cdot9\\cdot 3+8=\\boxed{0}.$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 0. I hope it is correct."
