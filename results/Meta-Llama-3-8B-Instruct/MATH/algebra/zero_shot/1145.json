Amin.\nInterfaces for approving and rejecting a payment order\nThe following is a description of the interfaces used to interact with the server for approving or rejecting a payment order.\nInterfaces for Approving a Payment Order\n1. `approvePaymentOrder()` method:\n   - This method is used to approve a payment order.\n   - It takes three parameters: `paymentOrderID` (unique identifier of the payment order), `paymentMethod` (the method of payment, e.g., credit card, bank transfer), and `amount` (the amount to be paid).\n2. `approvePaymentOrderAsync()` method:\n   - This method is similar to the `approvePaymentOrder` method but it is asynchronous, meaning it does not block the execution of the program until the operation is complete.\n   - It also takes the same three parameters as the `approvePaymentOrder` method.\nInterfaces for Rejecting a Payment Order\n1. `rejectPaymentOrder()` method:\n   - This method is used to reject a payment order.\n   - It takes two parameters",

I hope it is correct.\u00a0\ud83d\ude42\nThis probability problem had many ways to solve it. You could use probability rules, a diagram, or a tree diagram. One thing that stands out about this problem is that it required the problem solver to make connections between different parts of the problem. For instance, in order to calculate the probability of finding $\\boxed{4}$, you need to be able to calculate the probability of finding all of the factors that are required for that outcome, including the probability of finding $3$ and $1$ and multiplying those together. That\u2019s why we hope you are excited about this problem because there were many ways to solve it! We hope you are excited to solve the problem that stands out in this home study. These problems are a unique opportunity to learn about a variety of topics, such as probability, algebra, and geometry. You are working on completing the proof. So, how do you see it working out with $a+b$? If you have any thoughts, please share them with us"
