        " Before anything, Jasmine drank 1.5 pints. It says the rate, and the rate is 1.5 pints / 3 miles = 0.5 pints / mile. So if she walks 10 more miles, we can multiply 0.5 pints / mile by 10 miles. That is 0.5 x 10 = 5 pints. So in total, she would drink 1.5 pints + 5 pints = 6.5 pints. She would drink 6.5 pints. \n**Answer: 6.5**\n**Type: Test Prep**\n**Subject: Trigonometry**\n**Content: Rate**\n**Key-term: Pints, Rate, Miles, Water**\n**Challenge Level: Easy-Moderate**\n**Age Group: 10th-12th**\nThis question tests the student's ability to understand the concept of rate and apply it to a real-life scenario. The problem requires the student to set up a proportion and solve for the unknown quantity. The key-term \"pints\" is used to describe the rate, which helps the student to understand the context of the problem. This question is suitable for 10th-12th graders and is considered easy to moderate in difficulty.\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n1. Identify the given information: Jasmine drank 1.5 pints of water in 3 miles.\n2. Find the rate: The rate is 1.5 pints / 3 miles = 0.5 pints / mile.\n3. Find the total distance: Jasmine is asked to walk 10 more miles.\n4. Multiply the rate by the distance: 0.5 pints / mile x 10 miles = 5 pints.\n5. Add the initial amount to the total amount: 1.5 pints + 5 pints = 6.5 pints.\n**Key Terms:**\n1. Pints: A unit of volume.\n2. Rate: The ratio of output to input.\n3. Miles: A unit of distance.\n4. Water: The liquid being consumed.\n**Related ",

Well done! \ud83d\udc4f\nLet\u2019s summarize the correct solution:\n1. Jasmine drinks 1.5 pints of water in the first 3 miles. To find the rate at which she drinks water per mile, we divide 1.5 by 3: 1.5 / 3 = 0.5 pints per mile.\n2.

        " To determine how many pints Jasmine drank, consider the rate at which she drinks water. Jasmine drinks 1.5 pints per 3 miles. This means, she drinks 1.5 / 3 = 0.5 pints per 1 mile.
