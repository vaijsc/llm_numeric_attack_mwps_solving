(f^-1(x))(x)=x.\nSo we will change the LHS of the function f(x) = x^3. To get (x) out, we multiply x with itself two more times. So the LHS becomes x^3 = x * x * x.\n### In this step, the (x * x * x) should be written as a new function to be an equation. So the equation is:\nx = x * x * x.\n### In this process, the x * x * x equals to y because we want to write a new function with y as its argument. So the equation becomes:\nx = y.",

        " Think step by step, because it is easier than a direct solution. To find the inverse of a function $f$, you typically have to switch $x$ and $y$, and then solve for $y$ in terms of $x$, or we can draw the graph, since we are given that $f(x)=x^3$, draw the cube-shaped curve, and find the $y$-intercept (or $x$-intercepts), and that is the equation of $f^{-1}$. Now let\u2019s find it. $y=x^3$, now solve for $x$ in terms of $y$, that is, switch the $x$ and $y$ in the equation. $x=y^{(1/3)}$, and note that a two-variable equation is a relation, a set of ordered pairs, where each ordered pair corresponds to a single point on the graph of the function. The inverse of a relation is the relation that is obtained by switching the $x$ and $y$ in each ordered pair. The inverse of $f$ is the relation $\\{(y, x) | x=y^{1/3}\\}$. Now that $f^{-1}$ is determined, what is the value of $f^{-1}(8)\\div (f(8))^{-1}$? $f^{-1}(8)=8^{1/3}=2$, the cube root of $8$. $\\left(f(8)\\right)^{-1}=\\left(8^3\\right)^{-1}=8^{-3}=1/8$. $f^{-1}(8)\\div (f(8))^{-1}=\\dbinom{2}{\\frac{1}{8}}=2\\cdot8=\\boxed{16}$.
