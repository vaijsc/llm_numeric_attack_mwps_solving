        "To solve the equation \\(3x^2 - 2(x^2 + 4) = 42\\), we start by simplifying the expression on the left side.\n1.

However, there is an easier method, which is to notice that since the question asks for x^4, it might be easier to solve for x^4 directly.\nNotice that the original equation was 3x^2-2(x^2+4)=42. We know that 3x^2-2x^2 is 1x^2, which simplifies to x^2. Then, we know that the original equation becomes x^2-8=42.\nNow, if we take the equation x^2-8=42 and add 8 to both sides, we get x^2=50. We know that since the solutions are 5 and -5, we can write them like that:\nx=+5 or x=-5\nNow, if we take the equation x=5 for one part, x^2=(5)^2=25. And if we take the equation x=-5 for the other part, x^2=(-5)^2=25. The x^2 term is the same for both equations! So, the original question becomes 25.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 49.

Derivative applications and proof. Initial learning expressions Derivatives of Logarithmic functions of many functions Derivatives of fraction functions and composition case Read Solutions.\n#### Solution\nTo find the derivative of $\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$, we use the quotient rule. The quotient rule defines the derivative of a quotient as the difference of the derivative of the functions in the quotient and the product of the functions in the quotient. The function is given by $f(x)=3x^2$ and the function $g(x)=x^2+4$. We can now find the derivative of $f(x)$ and the derivative of $g(x)$, and from there, we can obtain the derivative of the function. To calculate the derivative of the function $f(x)$, we see that $f'(x)=\\frac{d}{dx}(3x^2)=6x$.\nTo calculate the derivative of the function $g(x)$, we use the power rule, which means that when we multiply a function by a power, we add the power to the exponent.

        " We can start by distributing the $-2$ to get\n$3x^2-2x^2-8=42$Now we can combine the terms of the left side to get\n$x^2-8=42$Subtracting 42 from both sides, we get\n$x^2=-50$Taking the square root of both sides, we get\n$x=\\pm5 i$Here is where our calculator can get us all sorts of trouble, but since we will eventually be taking the square of $x$, let\u2019s try both answers. Plugging the real part $x=5i$ back in the original equation gives us\n$3(5i)^2-2((5i)^2+4)=42$Substituting the imaginary part $5i$, we can replace $(5i)^2+4$ with $25i^2+4$. Since $i^2=-1$, we know that $25i^2=-25$ and substitute this value in our original equation to get\n$3(25)-2(-25+4)=42$Using the distributive property once and factoring $2$ terms in the problem, we can get\n$75+50=125$This is not equal to $42$, so we know that $5i$ is the wrong answer. The other answer, $x=-5i$, would also result in $42$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 625. I hope it is correct.  Final Answer: The final answer is 625. I hope it is correct.  Edit: We need to find $x^4$, though, and since we have $x=\\pm 5i$, we will have to find the square of each of these terms.  Doing this, we have$$x^4=(\\pm 5i)^4=(25i^2)^2=(-25)^2=625.$$Without a calculator, it\u2019s pretty darn difficult to figure out the square of an imaginary number, but you can try squaring $5i$ without taking out the calculator.  The final answer is indeed 625.  Final Answer: The final answer is 625. I hope it is correct. Final Answer: The final answer is 625. I hope it is correct. Final Answer: The final answer is 625.

        " $$\n3x^2-2(x^2+4)=42$$ The goal is to solve for $x^4$, so let\u2019s collect like terms on the left side: $$3x^2-2x^2-8=42$$ Combine the terms on the left to get $$x^2-8=42$$ Add 8 to both sides to get $$x^2=50$$ Then take the square root of both sides to get $$|x|=\\sqrt{50}=5\\sqrt{2}$$ Since the question doesn\u2019t ask for the modulus, we can choose either the positive or negative root. So we can set $x$ to either $5\\sqrt{2}$ or $-5\\sqrt{2}$. If we substitute either value for $x$ into the original equation, we should get true. Now let\u2019s calculate $x^4$ for both cases. If $x=5\\sqrt{2}$, then $$x^4=(5\\sqrt{2})^4=50^2\\cdot2=\\boxed{2500}$$ If $x=-5\\sqrt{2}$, then $$x^4=(-5\\sqrt{2})^4=50^2\\cdot2=\\boxed{2500}$$ Since both values of $x$ yield the same $x^4$, the correct answer is $\\boxed{2500}$.
