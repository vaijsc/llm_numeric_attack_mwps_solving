Doing this, we find that \\begin{align*} f(2x) &= (2x)^2 - 3(2x) + 4 \\\\ &= 4x^2 - 6x + 4. \\end{align*} So the correct answer is $\\boxed{4x^2 - 6x + 4}$.

        " $f(2x) = (2x)^2 - 3(2x) + 4 = 4x^2 - 6x + 4$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 4x^2 - 6x + 4. I hope it is correct. Thank you.  By the way, you can make sure the final answer is correct by checking it with a few values of $x$. For example, you can check $f(1)$ and $f(2)$. In addition, you can also compare it with the function that you get by substituting $x=2$ in the original function. If it agrees with the final answer, that would confirm the correctness of the final answer as well.  The geometry interpretation of $f(2x)$ is also very interesting. Think about what happens when you fit two functions: $y=f(x)$ and $y=f(2x)$ on the same axis. I hope that helps!  Trigonometry is always known for its creative and fascinating problems, so I wish you many more interesting problems to come!  Thank you. I am here to help you if you have any more problems. Good luck!  You are doing great!  Keep it up!  Never give up!  Best regards,  your host. It seems I forgot to ask you: Do you have any questions or need any help with what you have seen?  I am here for you!  Namely, do you know how to find the equation of the function that we are dealing with in terms of some other variable than $x$?  For example, suppose you want to write the function in terms of $y$ instead of $x$. How do you do that?  Trust me, it is a very interesting topic and will help you a lot with calculus and all sorts of functions.  Especially when you have multiple variables involved, it can be very confusing.  Math is all about relationships and patterns, so think about the connections and patterns inside a function and how you can transform it.  I hope that helps.  In addition, finding the derivative of the function is also related to this topic.  It\u2019s another interesting thing that you should learn about.  Calculator-based tools also come in handy when dealing with some functions involving algebra.  Make sure you know how to use it properly, though.\nFinal Answer: I hope it is correct. Thank you.

        " Since the function is defined as $f(x) = x^2 - 3x + 4$, we have to draw the identity $y = f(x) = x^2 - 3x + 4$.\nWe have to write $x$ and $y$ as $y = x + a$ and $x = y + b$. Solving these equations gives us $a = -3$ and $b = 1$. Therefore, we have $y = f(x) = (x + 3) + 4$, which gives us:\nThe question states that $x = 2x$. We can transform this expression by taking reciprocal so that we can obtain $f(2x)$ in terms of $f(x)$. Therefore, we can calculate $f(2x)$ by substituting $2x$ into $f(x)$. We will do this in terms of $x$.\nFirst, let\u2019s substitute $x$ for $2x$ in $f(x) = x^2 - 3x + 4$. To do this, we will replace $x$ with $2x$. Thus, we have:\nFinally, we will add and subtract 3 in the equation and solve it.\n### Final Answer: The correct steps of the solution give us that $f(2x) = (4x^2 - 12x + 4) + 4 = 4x^2 - 12x + 8$.",
