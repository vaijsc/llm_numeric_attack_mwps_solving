This is a good explanation. To make it even better, you could have included more detail about how to arrive at the answer. For example, you could have explicitly written out the terms of the polynomial to show how the degrees add up. Additionally, you could have provided a sentence or two about why it is reasonable to assume that each term in each polynomial is a sum of its corresponding terms. This would make your explanation more clear and helpful to readers. Rating: Good, but could be improved. Keep up the good work!  #### Final Answer: The final answer is 8. I hope it is correct.

So, the highest degree term in the product will be \\begin{align*}\n(ax^6)(x^5)(x^2) &= a(x^{6+5+2})\\\\\n&=ax^{13}.\n\\end{align*}\nSo, the degree of the polynomial is $\\boxed{13}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 13.

The first polynomial is $(ax^6+bx^8+cx^3+d)$. The highest power of x here is the highest degree term, which is $bx^8$, equal to $\\boxed{8}$.\n2. The second polynomial is $(x^5+ex^4+f)$. The highest power of x here is $x^5$, equal to $\\boxed{5}$.\n3. The third polynomial is $(x^2+gx+h)$. The highest power of x here is $x^2$, equal to $\\boxed{2}$.\n4.

For example, $(x^6)(x^5)$ has degree 11, then $x^6$ is factored into the constant and $a$ in the front, so now we have $(ax^6)(x^5)$ has degree 11. This is added to other terms which are: $(x^8)(x^5)$ has degree 13, $(x^3)(x^5)$ has degree 8, and the constant multiplied by the third term. We now know that there are terms of degree 13 or higher, and terms of degree 11 or higher, and terms of degree 8, 6, 4, 3, 2, and 0.\n### Conclusion: The highest power of $x$ in the polynomial is $13$, so the degree is $13.$\n### Alternative Answer: Note that the highest power of $x$ in the first factor is 8, the highest power of $x$ in the second factor is 5, and the highest power of $x$ in the third factor is 2. Adding these gives the degree of the polynomial: $\\boxed{8+5+2=15}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 15. I hope it is correct.  Some textbooks or resources may return 13 as the answer.  But ultimately, the answer can affect your problem-solving approach. For example, if you want to multiply two terms of degree 8 and of degree 5, if the answer contains a term of degree 15, then we get another approach because we know that there will be a term of degree 15. For me, when you see multiple terms that are extremely different, we have degrees that are far apart, like 13, or an ascending ranking degree 15, for this case.  ### Final Note:"
