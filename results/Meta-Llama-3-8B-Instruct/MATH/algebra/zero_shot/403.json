An easier way to solve this is to notice that $$ (4x+11)(2x-8) = 8x^2 - 32x + 22x - 88 = 8x^2 - 10x - 88$$ and $x(2x+7) = 2x^2+7x$, so we want to find the largest value of $x$ such that $$8x^2 - 10x - 88 = 2x^2+7x$$ This is the same as finding the largest value of $x$ such that $$6x^2 - 17x - 88 = 0$$ Any way, since the discriminant is $17^2-4\\cdot6\\cdot88=625-2112=-1487$ so we can\u2019t use quadratic formula. But we know that $x^2-2xy + y^2 = (x-y)^2$, so $x^2 - 2xy +y^2 + xy = (x-y)^2+y^2 = (x-y+\\frac{y}{2})^2 + \\frac{3}{4}y^2$. I hope it is correct. I hope it is correct.

        " We can rewrite $(4x+11)(2x-8)$ as $8x^2+2x-44$, since $2x-8=0$ implies that $x=\\frac{4}{1}$, which is not a solution of the equation. (However, $x=-\\frac{11}{4}$ is a solution.) Similarly, we can rewrite $x(2x+7)$ as $2x^2+7x$. Equating these two expressions, we obtain\n$$8x^2+2x-44=2x^2+7x,$$which is equivalent to $6x^2-5x-44=0$ or $(3x+11)(2x-4)=0$. Since $x=-\\frac{11}{3}$ is not a solution of the equation, we can conclude that $x=\\boxed{\\frac{4}{1}}$. Note that we could have also used the rational root theorem to factor $8x^2+2x-44$ and instead solved $8x^2+2x-44=0$ to find $x=\\frac{4}{1}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 4/1.

        " I would like to make sure that this solution seems workable before proceeding. Since we can re-arrange the given equation such that \\begin{align*} 4x^2-15x-44&=0 \\end{align*} Let\u2019s think step by step. I would want to try to factor it using the quadratic formula: the quadratic formula might help us to find the factors, If I were lucky enough, it might allow me to solve for $x$ and then I could find the largest value. The quadratic formula is \\begin{align*} x &= \\frac{-(-15) \\pm \\sqrt{15^2 - 4(4)(-44)}}{8}\\\\ &= \\frac{15 \\pm \\sqrt{225 + 704}}{8}\\\\ &= \\frac{15 \\pm \\sqrt{929}}{8} \\end{align*} These both look like integer-ish real solutions. Thus, the two real solutions are $\\frac{15 + \\sqrt{929}}{8} \\approx 3.46$ and $\\frac{15 - \\sqrt{929}}{8} \\approx 0.44$. So I guess that the question is, which one is bigger? I just have to compare them. The second one is bigger by an eyeball, and this can be verified. They are actually actually 0.554 and 3.4589, as if I had taken the time to essentially evaluate these expressions carefully Failsafe check: this solution seems to make logical sense, in the sense that you can always check the equation I think. Make sure any idea of yours is tested. -says Peter T. Next, in order to make sure my answer looks a little more polished, an additional approach that I used would be to note that $(4x+11)(2x-8) = 8x^2 - 28x + 22$ and $x(2x+7)=2x^2+7x$. So, it looks like \\begin{align*} 8x^2-28x+22&=2x^2+7x \\end{align*} with 2x2-x+6=-28 terms and all of that looks like it could be right. Thus, we have \\begin{align*} 6x^2-35x+22=0. \\end{align*}\n### Final Answer: The largest value of x is \\",
        " The given equation is: (4x+11)(2x-8)=x(2x+7). To solve for x, we can start by distributing the left side of the equation. This gives us 8x^2 - 32x + 22x - 88 = x(2x+7). If we distribute the right side of the equation as well, we get 8x^2 - 10x - 88 = 2x^2+7x. Now, if we move all the terms to the left side of the equation, we get 6x^2 - 17x - 88 = 0. We can factor the quadratic equation as follows: (x-8)(6x+11) = 0. Therefore, the solutions to the equation are x = 8 and x = -11/6. The largest value of x such that the equation is true is therefore x = 8. Final Answer: The final answer is x = 8. I hope it is correct. Please let me know your feedback. -Apurvani Aggarwal. ",
