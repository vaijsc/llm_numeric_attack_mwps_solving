We can rearrange this to get $$(102+98)(102-98),$$ which is $$200(4)=\\boxed{800}.$$ In the following we explain all the steps, but the answer has already been typed above.\nWe should initially evaluate $102^2-98^2$. To do this, we use the difference of two squares identity: $$a^2-b^2=(a+b)(a-b).$$ We then apply this to the expression: $$102^2-98^2=(102+98)(102-98).$$ Now we are left with computing two simple expressions; we can easily do this and combine these with the product of two numbers. We perform this and then simplfy everything. To find $102-98$, we simply subtract $98$ from $102$, leaving $4$. Adding $98$ and $102$ together, we get $200$, as they are just the terms on the left. We then multiply $4$ with $200$ to get $800$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 800. I hope it is correct.##",

        " $102^2 - 98^2$\nCapital idea! To simplify this expression, we can use the Difference of Squares formula: $(x+y)(x-y) = x^2 - y^2$.\nSo, $(102 + 98)(102 - 98) = (200)(4) = \\boxed{800}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 800. I hope it is correct.## Discussion:\n\u2022 We are given the expression $102^2 - 98^2$ and asked to simplify it.\n\u2022 We used the Difference of Squares formula: $(x+y)(x-y) = x^2 - y^2$ to simplify the expression.\n\u2022 By plugging in $102$ for $x$ and $98$ for $y$, we get $(102 + 98)(102 - 98) = (200)(4) = \\boxed{800}$.\n\u2022 The final answer is indeed 800.## Challenge ",

Here are a few ways we can do that:\n*   Hint: The instruction only says \"Evaluate,\" so we don't know if it's implying that the powers might be exponents.\n*   Convert the exponential powers to multiplication and division to solve the problem in multiple ways. This may reduce the complexity and solution.\"`\nYou can do it! However, I provided a more detailed solution for your convenience. \nP.S. I hope that's a fun problem for you to solve.
