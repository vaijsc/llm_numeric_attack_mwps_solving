        " When the expression $a + bx$ takes the value $15$ when $x = 2$, we have $a + 2b = 15$. Similarly, when the value of the expression is $3$ when $x = 5$, we have $a + 5b = 3$.\nNow, we can solve a system of linear equations using method of elimination or substitution.\nLet\u2019s use method of elimination.\nHere, we can eliminate the term $a$ by multiplying both equations by a necessary coefficient and subtracting the second equation from the first.\nWe multiply the first equation by $-1$ and the second equation by $1$, so that the terms of $a$ are the same in sign and modulus, as shown below.\n$$(a + 2b = 15) \\times -1: -a - 2b = -15$$\n$$(a + 5b = 3) \\times 1: a + 5b = 3$$\nWe now subtract the second equation from the first.

        " $a = 1, b = 2$, so $a + b = \\boxed{3}$.\nWe know that a linear equation of the form $a + bx$ has a value of 15 when $x = 2$ and a value of 3 when $x = 5$. This means that the equation $a + 2b = 15$ must be true, and also the equation $5a + 10b = 3$. Now, we must solve for $a$ and $b$.\nSo, the equations are:\n$a + 2b = 15$;\n$5a + 10b = 3$.\nThen, if we multiply equation (1) by $-5$, we get $-5a - 10b = -75$, which is equivalent to equation (2). Now, our equations become equivalent to each other, so we can say that\n$a + 2b = 15$\n$-5a - 10b = -75$.\nFrom here, if we add the equations, we get $-4b = -60$, and that is equivalent to\n$b = 15$.\nNow, if we substitute this value into equation (1), we get\n$a + 2(15) = 15$\n$a + 30 = 15$.\nSubtracting 30 in both sides, we get\n$a = -15$.\nSo, we have $a = -15$ and $b = 15$.

When x = 2, our equation is $22.2-18/5(2) = 15$, or $22.2-36/5=15$.\n\\begin{align*}\n22.2-36/5&=15,",

Equations with variables can be combined as follows $a+2b=15$ $a+5b=3$ Subtracting the first equation from the second equation will eliminate $a$ (\\(a \\) will eliminate because it is on both sides). \\begin{align*} a+5b&=3\\\\ \\underline{(a+2b)}&=(15)\\\\ 3b&=-12\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad b&=-4 \\end{align*}Substituting this value into $a+2b=15$ we obtain $a+2(-4)=15$.

The expression has the value when the input, $x$, has the assigned value, in this case $x = 2$ or $x = 5$. We are given the values of the expression, $a + bx$, at those values of $x$:\n\\begin{align*}\na + 2b &= 15\\\\\na + 5b &= 3\n\\end{align*}We will need these values to solve for $a$ and $b$.
