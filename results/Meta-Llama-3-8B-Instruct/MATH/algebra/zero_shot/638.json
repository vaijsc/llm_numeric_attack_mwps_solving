        " 4\nProblem Solving.\nFirst, $40^2 = 1600$ and $42^2 = (40 + 2)^2 = 1600 + 80 + 4 = 1684$. Indeed, adding $164$ to $40^2$ gives us $42^2$.\nNext, $38^2 = (40 - 2)^2 = 1600 - 4\\cdot 40 + 4 = 1440 - 4\\cdot 40 + 4 = 1440 - 156 = 1284$. If Emily subtracts $x$ from $40^2$, we need $x$ such that $40^2 - x = 38^2$, which gives us $x = 40^2 - 38^2 = 1600 - 1284 = \\boxed{4}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 4.

Hence, our answer is $\\boxed{4^2}$.I hope it is correct. Final Answer: The final answer is 4^2. I hope it is correct.]\nLet\u2019s combine our two answers.\nIn math, $42^2$ is $(40+2)^2$. The square of the sum is the sum of the squares plus twice the products of the terms, so $42^2$ must equal $(40+2)^2=40^2+160+4=40^2+164$. Emily has done exactly this. She has figured $40^2$ and then added 164. In fact, she has added 4, which is just $2^2$, and then has added 160, which is 4 times 40. In math, $38^2$ is the square of $(40-2)$, which is $40^2-4^2-2\\cdot40\\cdot2$. This is $40^2-4^2-160$. Emily has done exactly this. She has figured $40^2$ and then has subtracted 4, which is $2^2$, and then has subtracted 160. If we are asked what Emily has subtracted, we know that she has subtracted $4^2$. Therefore, the answer is $4^2$. Final Answer: The final answer is 4^2. I hope it is correct.\nLicense Info",

        " Emily computes $42^2$ by mentally calculating $40^2$ and adding $4^2$, or, by her way, adding $164$ (without worrying about justifying $4^2=16$). So she must think $42^2=40^2+4^2=40^2+16.$ Now, let\u2019s think about how she computes $38^2$. Since $40^2-(38^2)=(40-38)(40+38)=2\\cdot78=156$, she thinks that subtracting 156 from $40^2$ will give her $38^2.$ That is, $38^2=40^2-156.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 156.
