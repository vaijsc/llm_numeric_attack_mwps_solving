    "solution": "We know that $x^2 - y^2 = (x+y)(x-y)$. To begin with, let $x = 26^2 - 24^2 - 10$ and $y = 10$. Factoring $x^2 - y^2$ and substituting in gives $(26^2-24^2-10+10)(26^2-24^2-10-10)$. Now, let $x = 26$ and $y = 24$. Factoring $x^2 - y^2$ and substituting in gives $((26+24)(26-24)-10+10)((26+24)(26-24)-10-10)$. This simplifies to $(50\\cdot 2)(50 \\cdot 2 - 20)$, or $100 \\cdot 80$. Thus, our final answer is $\\boxed{8000}$.",

Well, I hope it is correct.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 300. I hope it is correct.  Always, always, always simplify from the left to the right.  I learned something new today, thanks for commenting!  It seems that there is a variable in our inequality, is that possible?  Of course, it is a possible scenario to have an inequality with a variable.  Now we are going to solve this inequality: $$x^2 + 2x - 6 \\le 0.$$ Step 1: We must factor LHS, which is the left-hand side of the inequality.  Factoring $x^2 + 2x - 6$, we get $$(x + 3)(x - 2) = 0.$$\nStep 2: we should find out when the original inequality is satisfied. If we would find solutions for the equality, then we substitute them back into $x^2 + 2x - 6 \\le 0$. This replace $x$ by these two solutions will give us $x$. Why are we doing this? This is because the roots of the polynomial times the vector $(x + 3)(x - 2)$ will give us zero, so each of them must give us zero separately.\nTherefore, we can say $$$x + 3 = 0$ so $x = -3.$\nSo, we have $x - 2 = 0$ which gives us $x = 2$, the $x - 2$ one is always equal to zero.\nSo, we found that two numbers are $x = 2$, and $x = -3$. We must set them equal to the original inequality to test if it is $x^2 + 2x",

I hope it is correct. Footer Footer FULL SOLUTION We have $(26^2 - 24^2 - 10)^2 - 10^2$. We can use the difference of squares formula to simplify $26^2 - 24^2 = 52 - 48 = 4$.  Now we have $(4 - 10)^2 - 10^2$. Simplifying this some more, we get $90^2 - 10^2$. The square of 90 is just 90 times 90 which is 8100. So the final result is 8100 - 10^2. The square of 10 is 10 times 10 which is 100. So 8100 - 100 is 7900.\nLove the app, it makes me feel confident and prepared for my test.
