We are given that p=28 when q=7, so we know that k=pq=28\\cdot7=196. Then p=196/ q. Solving this for p when q=49, we find: p=(196)/49=\\boxed{4}. In other words the value of p when q=49 is 4. WARNING: this answer is wrong since p is given to be 28 for q=7. So we should not have p=4 for q=49 as the question says find p for a different value of q, then we need to substitute the value of k given by 28/7 into the equation p=k/ q and we obtain p=196/49=\\boxed{196}. In other words the value of p when q=49 is 196. Final Answer: The final answer is",

It is expressed in the equation of the form p=k/q where k is a constant. Plugging in p=28 and q=7, we obtain k=196. So the equation becomes p=196/q. If q=49, then we have p=196/49 which equals 4.   joker  come and go #12 02:42:02 1334208422   Here is the step by step solution.   Let p and q be inversely proportional. Then p = k/q, where k is a constant. When q = 7, p = 28, so 28 = k/7.  Multiply both sides of the equation by 7 to obtain 196 = k. So, p = k/q = 196/q. When q = 49, p = 196/49 = 4. Therefore, p = 4 when q = 49. Final Answer: The final answer is 4",
