So, the first hint should probably be \"Heading in the right direction.\" So, the line from (0, 0) to (9, 6) is parallel to the lines with equations 6x=9y and y=3x, and is perpendicular to the lines with equations y=-9x and y=3x+2. If we are a third of the way along the line from (0, 0) to (9, 6) from the origin, then we can write x= and y=. If we square both sides of each equation and then add the two equations together, we should get the sum of the squares of x and y.

In other words, calculate the coordinates of a point halfway from (0, 0) to (9, 6). ### Let's dive into the problem. We are given two points: (0, 0) and (9, 6). The distance between (0, 0) and (9, 6) can be calculated by the distance formula: `d = sqrt((9-0)^2 + (6-0)^2) = 3 sqrt(10)`\nSo, the equation of the line passing through these two points is given by:\n`y = 0.666 * (9 - x) + 0`\nThis is a linear equation in slope-intercept form, where the slope is 0.666 (or 2/3) and the y-intercept is 0.\nNow, we are asked to find a point that is 1/3 (or 2/6) of the way from (0, 0) to (9, 6). This means that the x-coordinate of the desired point will be 7 (since 9/3 = 3, and 9 - 3 = 7).\nThe y-coordinate can be calculated by plugging in x = 7 into the equation:\n`y = 0.666 * (9 - 7) + 0 = 0.666 * 2 + 0 = 1.32`\nSo, the desired point is (7, 1.32).\nThe sum",
        " From the origin to $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the way to (9, 6), we will move $\\frac{1}{3}\\cdot 9=\\frac{9}{3}=3$ spaces horizontally, and $\\frac{1}{3}\\cdot 6=\\frac{6}{3}=2$ spaces vertically.\nSo our new point is located at (3, 2).\nThe sum of the coordinates of this point is $3+2=\\boxed{5}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 5.

        " - We are given two points: $(0,0)$ and $(9,6)$. We move $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the way along the segment. This means we will land at $\\frac{1}{3}$ along the entire distance. To find the whole distance, we will use Pythagorean theorem. The distance is $d = \\sqrt{(9-0)^2 + (6-0)^2} = \\sqrt{81 + 36} = \\sqrt{117} = 3\\sqrt{13}$. Now we will move $\\frac{1}{3}$ of that distance. $\\frac{1}{3} \\times 3\\sqrt{13} = \\sqrt{13}$. This is the distance we move. We move, for example, 3.3, it means we move in the horizontal direction 3 units and vertical direction 3.3 units. But here, it means we move in the horizontal direction $\\sqrt{13}$ units and vertical direction $\\sqrt{13}$ units. We will use our points again, $(0,0)$ and $(9,6)$, to find the answer. We move $\\sqrt{13}$ units horizontally and vertically. So when we move $\\sqrt{13}$ units along the horizontal, we will land at $(\\sqrt{13},0)$ point. When we move $\\sqrt{13}$ units along the vertical, we will land at $(0,\\sqrt{13})$ point. But we are moving both horizontally and vertically, so we will add them together. To add the sum of coordinates, we will add $\\sqrt{13}$ and $0$, then $\\sqrt{13} + 0 = \\boxed{\\sqrt{13}}$. So the sum of the coordinates of the point you land upon is $\\boxed{\\sqrt{13}}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\sqrt{13}. I hope it is correct.  - ESHER AHMED \n",
