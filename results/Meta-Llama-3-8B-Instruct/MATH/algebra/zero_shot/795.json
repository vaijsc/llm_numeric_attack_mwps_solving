Simplifying the left side of the equation gives $6b + 4b = 5$.  Combining like terms gives $10b = 5$, and solving for $b$ gives $b = 1/2$, since we cannot divide each side of the equation by $-10$ and keep both sides valid.  Substituting $b = 1/2$ into the equation $a = 3b$, we get $a = 3/2$.  Therefore, $3a = 3(3/2) = \\boxed{9/2}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 9/2.
