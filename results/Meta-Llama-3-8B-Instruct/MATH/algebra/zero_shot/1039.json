        " $P=(a,b)$ is the point of intersection of the line $y=2x-10$ and the line through $(7,8)$ and $(9,0)$.  We will find this first line by plugging $(7,8)$ into $y=2x-10$: $8=2\\cdot7-10\\Rightarrow 18=14\\Rightarrow 4=0$.  We know $9\\ne0$, so we can determine the slope of this line by using the standard slope formula: $m=\\frac{8-0}{7-9}=-8/2=-4$.  The slope is $-4$, the $y$-intercept is $8$.  Since we know the point $(7,8)$ (yiesn\u2019t lie!), we can use the point-slope formula to determine the equation of this line: $y-8=-(x-7)\\cdot4$.  We can solve for $y$: $y=8-4x+28=4x+36$.  Now, we know the point $(7,8)$ and $y=2x-10$, and we\u2019re looking for the intersection point.  We can plug $(7,8)$ into $y=2x-10$: $8=2\\cdot7-10\\Rightarrow 0=6$.  Oops!  We cannot find a point from negative and solve this error, but we can find the way.  notice that $(7,8)$ lies on the line we\u2019ve determined.  We can solve the system using substitution or elimination method.  We will use substitution.  Substituting the $y$-value of equation of a line through $(7,8)$ and $(9,0)$ into $y=2x-10$: $4x+36=2x-10\\Rightarrow2x=46\\Rightarrow x=23$.  Now, we have to find $b$ using $y=2x-10$: $b=2a-10$.  We already have that $a = 23$.  And now, we can solve. $b=2a-10\\Rightarrow 46-10=36$.  Finally, $a+b=23+36=\\boxed{59}$.\nWe can express this using a simple formula.  Let the lines have equations $y=2x-10$ and $y=\\frac{-4}{1}x+b$. ",
        " Firstly, the point of intersection is described by $2x-10=y$, and also $y = 2x-10$, which is equivalent to $2x = y+10$, and hence $y=2x-10$ and $y = 2x-10$ is a pair of equations of lines known as identity. In this set of the equations the equation $y=2x-10$ is the same line. So that $P=(a,b)$ the point of intersection of $y=2x-10$ and the line $y = m(x-c) +d$. $m(x-c) + d$ , $m(x-c) + d$ that\u2019s the equation of line. Which means we should find the line that passes through $(7,8) , (9,0)$ then find the point of intersection with $y=2x-10$. Step 2:  finding the equation of the line that passes through $(7,8) , (9,0)$.  Lines that passes through $(7,8) , (9,0)$. Now use $m(x-c) + d$ we will find the $m$ and $c$.   Since the point $(7,8)$ lies on the line so $m(7-c)+d=8$, so it becomes $7m+8m-8=d$, $8m=d-8$.  Since $m(x-c)+d=0$, it therefore becomes $9m=d$  and $9m=d$ thus $d=9m$, and using $d=8m-8$,$8m-8=9m$, we find $m = \\frac{8}{8}=1$. The slope $m = 1$ .  The $c$ we can find that $c = 7$, c-7 is the formula  $m(x-c)+d=y$ . What Next then we will calculate the equation by finding the details of $c$ , $m$. We found that $m=1$ and $c=7$ In that case we have  know  $m(x-c) + d$  $y= x-7+8$ Now only find $y$ it becomes $y=x+1$. Since we have $y = 2x - 10.$ It becomes $x+1=2x-10$, 2x-1 - 1=x-10, 2",
        " Step 1: Write the equation of the line containing $(7,8)$ and $(9,0)$.\nThe equation of the line through $(7,8)$ and $(9,0)$ is $\\frac{y-8}{x-7}=\\frac{8-0}{7-9}$. This is equivalent to $y-8=-x$, and thus $y=-x+8$.\nStep 2: Determine the y value at $x=a$:\nSet $y=2x-10$ equal to $y=-x+8$, to determine when the lines intersect.\n$$2x-10=-x+8\\Rightarrow3x=18\\Rightarrow x=6.$$If $x=6$, then $y=2x-10=2(6)-10=-4$.",
        " Let's break it down! To find the point $P=(a,b)$ of intersection, we first find the equation of the line through $(7,8)$ and $(9,0)$.\nWe do this using the slope formula. The slope of this line is \\frac{8-0}{7-9}=-\\frac{8}{2}=-4, and we know a point on the line is (7,8). So, the equation of the line is y=-(4)(x-7)+8. That is, y=-(4x-28)+8. Distributing, we get y=-4x+36. That\u2019s the equation of the line.\nNow we need to find when this line intersects the line y=2x-10. Solve y = 2x-10 and y = -4x+36 for when x = a. 2x-10 = -4x+36. 6x = 46, x = 7.5.\nNow, we plug that x value into y = 2x-10: y = (2)(7.5) \u2013 10. y = 15-10. y = 5.\nPlugging into y = -4x+36, y = -4(7.5)+36. y = -30+36. y = 6.\nWe see that the two lines intersect when x = 7.5 and y = 5. That\u2019s our point P. So, a=7.5, b=5, and a + b=7.5 + 5 = 12.5 + 5 = 17.5.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 17.5. I hope it is correct.### Other Problems: Let $(a,b)$ be the point where the line $y=mx+b$ and the line $y=kx+d$ intersect. Show that $$.m=\\frac{k(a-kd/b)}{a}$$ Proof. Suppose that the point of intersection is (x,y). Then, $x=\\frac{yd-b}{m}$. Now, $y=mx+b$ and $y=kx+d$. Plug in for $x$ and equate, to find $kx+d = mx+b$. Then $d-md=kb-kxd$. So $d(k-m)=kb$. Therefore, $d\\frac{k-m}{b}=k=\\frac{kb}{b}$. Also",
        " First find the slope of the line segment connecting $(7,8)$ and $(9,0)$.  The slope is\n$m = \\frac{0-8}{9-7} = \\frac{-8}{2} = -4.$\nNow this line will have a slope of $m$ and passes through $(7,8)$.  We can write down the equation of the line:\n$y-8 = m (x-7) \\Rightarrow y-8 = -4(x-7) \\Rightarrow y = -4x + 28.$\nWe can also write the equation of another line\n$y = 2x -10$.\nAs the point $P$ lies on both lines, then $P$ should satisfy both equations.  So we solve the equations simultaneously:\n$-4x+28 = 2x - 10 \\Rightarrow 6x = 38 \\Rightarrow x = 38/6 = 19/3$.\nAnd so $y = -4(19/3) + 28 = -76/3 + 28 = -52/3 + 28*3/3 = 28-52/3 = 52/3 - 52/3 = 0$.\nSo, we find that the point $P=(19/3,0)$.

        " So the line through $(7,8)$ and $(9,0)$ can be written as $y-8=\\frac{-8}{2}(x-7)$.We need to simplify it and convert it into $y=mx+b$ form.  $$y-8=\\frac{-8}{2}(x-7)$$ $$y-8=-4x+28$$ $$y= -4x+36$$So we found the equation of the line through the point $(7,8)$ and $(9,0)$.  Next, we find the equation of the line $y=2x-10$.  Now we try to find the point of intersection by solving the system of equations.$$y= -4x+36$$ $$y= 2x-10$$ We equal these two expressions for $y$: $$-4x+36= 2x-10$$ $$-6x=46$$ Divide both sides by $-6$ and solve for $x$: $$x=\\frac{-46}{-6}=7.33$$Now that we have $x$, we substitute it to one of the two equations we have: $$2x-10=2(7.33)-10=14.66-10=4.66$$ $$y=4.66$$So, the point of intersection is $(7.33,4.66)$, or $P=(a,b)$.

Now we know that the line $y=2x-10$ is a line, and this other line is $y=-4x+36$, so these two lines intersect at some point.  That is, we have the following equations for the lines:$$y=2x-10,\\qquad y=-4x+36.$$Since the lines intersect, we can equate the $y$-values.  That is,$$2x-10=-4x+36.$$Let\u2019s manipulate this equation.  First, we can add $4x$ to both sides.  On the left hand side, this gives us $6x-10$, and on the right hand side, this gives us $36$, so we obtain $6x-10=36$.  Now, we can add $10$ to both sides.

        " $(7,8)$ and $(9,0)$  are points on the line.  The line is then in the form $y=mx+c$ where $m$ is the slope and $c$ is the $y$-intercept.\nThe first step is to compute the slope\n\\begin{align}\nm&=\\frac{0-8}{9-7}\\\\\n&=\\frac{-8}{2}\\\\\n&=-4.\n\\end{align}Now, using either of the points, say $(7,8)$, we can compute $c$.\n\\begin{align}\n8&=-4(7)+c\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 8&=-28+c\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad c&=36\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad y&=-4x+36\n\\end{align}The last step is to find the point $P$.  The point that satisfies $y=2x-10$ and $y=-4x+36$.\n\\begin{align}\n2x-10&=-4x+36\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 6x&=46\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x&=\\frac{46}{6}=7.33\n\\end{align}Using $x=7.33$ in the equation $y=2x-10$ gives $$y=2(7.33)-10=-1.66.$$ Therefore, the point $P$ is at $(a,b)=(7.33,-1.66)$. Then, we have $a+b=7.33+(-1.66)=\\boxed{5.67}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 5.67. I hope it is correct.  I Love you more than God (OPTIONAL)\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 5.67.

        " Let's find the point of intersection. The point of intersection of a line and a line is given by $\\frac{x_1-x_0}{y_1-y_0}=\\frac{y_1-y_0}{x_1-x_0}$.\nNow we have to find the points of intersection of both lines with $y$ coordinate. So let's first find it:\n### "
