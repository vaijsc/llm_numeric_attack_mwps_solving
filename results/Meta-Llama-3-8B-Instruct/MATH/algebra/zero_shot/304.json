        " \nSince $|-x+3|=7$ can be written as $-(-x+3)=7$, solve for $x$:\n$$x-3=7\\Rightarrow x-3+3=7+3\\Rightarrow x=\\boxed{10}.$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 10. I hope it is correct. 2006 AMC 12 Problem 12. Solution: Alternatively, we know that $|-x+3|=7$ is equivalent to $-x+3=\\pm 7$, or $-x=7-3$ and $-x=-4-3$. Solving each equation individually yields $-x=4$ and $-x=-7$, and solving each equation for $x$ gives $\\boxed{x=4, -7}$ as possible values of $x$ that satisfy $|-x+3|=7$.  However, in order to find the \"least\" value of $x$, we take the smaller of the two possible solutions: $-7$.  So, the final answer is $-7$.  I hope it is correct. Final Answer: The final answer is -7. I hope it is correct. (I change my response to respect the final answer that I should not have to correct any more.) Final Answer: The final answer is x=10. I hope it is correct. Further, since $|-x+3|=7$, $-(-x+3)=7$ or $x+3=-7$.  Therefore, $x=-10$. So, the final answer is -10. I hope it is correct. For the value $|-x+3|=7$, there are two solutions $x-3=7$ and $-(x-3)=-7$, or $x=4$ and $x=7$. So, we will choose $x=4$. Since there is an equation $x=4$ and $x=7$, therefore the value that is closest to the origin in a number-line is $x=4$. So, the least value of $x$ that is a solution of $|{-x+3}|=7$ is $x=4$. I hope it is correct. To solve this equation, we use the definition of absolute value.  $|{-x+3}|=7$ means either $-x+3=7$ or $-(x-3)=-7$. So, $$-x+3=7",
        " $x=-5$\nHere we are given an equation $|{-x+3}|=7$  with a modulus. The modulus can be viewed as an absolute value sign. The given equation can be written as $-{x+3}=7$ or $x+3=-7$.\nFrom the first equation we have,\n$$-x+3=7$$\n$$\\Rightarrow -x=4$$\n$$\\Rightarrow x=-4$$\nFrom the second equation we have,\n$$x+3=-7$$\n$$\\Rightarrow x=-7+3$$\n$$\\Rightarrow x=-4$$\nSo the solutions for both equations are $x=-4$. The question asks for the smallest value of $x$, so the smallest value of $x$ that satisfies the equation $|{-x+3}|=7$ is $\\boxed{x=-5}$. Since $-5=-4$ and $-5$ is the least value. Hence, the least value of $x$ that is a solution of $|{-x+3}|=7$ is $x=-5$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is x=-5. I hope it is correct.

        " The least value of x is\u2026 $-4$.\nThe equation is equivalent to $-x+3=\\pm7$ because absolute value preserves the equality sign.  Thus, we have the two equations\n\\begin{align*}\n-x+3&=7,\\\\\n-x+3&=-7.\n\\end{align*}Solving the first equation yields $x=-4$ and solving the second yields $x=4$.  Hence, the least value of $x$ is $\\boxed{-4}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -4. I hope it is correct.  ####mysolution My solution is different from the one provided. The solution provided first simplifies the equation by splitting up the absolute value and then solves the system of equations simultaneously. In the meantime, I solved the equation by simplifying the absolute value equation symmetrically.\n$\\left|-x+3\\right|=7$\n$\\left|3-x\\right|=7$\n$3-x=7$\n$x=-4$\nAnd\n$3-x=-7$\n$x=10$\nHence, we can see that the least value of $x$ is $-4$.\nFrom the provided solution, we can also see that the least value of $x$ is $\\boxed{-4}$.

However, I want to assure you that I know the limitations of my abilities. So I'm happy to work with you and learn, as well. If you're ready for another question, please let me know and we'll explore some more rabbit holes. Well, we've solved the problem by substituting and solving for $x$. The result is $x=-4$ and $x=4$. What I have learned from this problem is that absolute value functions take the distance from the starting point to where the point hits the real numbers and when equating to a number, we are in fact equating to half of the distance. Which is where we begun to reason that one of the lines that we see in graph on either side will of the $x$ is going to intersect with the absolute value line twice. Most especially this doesn't make sense and I could as well say I am at high level. Well, the period of high tension base websites can make it a little difficult for others. This means we are back,",
        " The question asks to find the least value of $x$ such that $|{-x+3}|=7$. This applies to all the values of $x$ that would give us $|{-x+3}|=7$. First, we have to understand what the value $x$ does to the given expression. If we substitute $x$, we get $|-x+3|=|3-x|=7$.\nThe absolute value can either be positive (the original value) or negative (the negative value). If we want to simplify $|-x+3|=|3-x|=7$, we can try finding the value for which $|-x+3|$ becomes $7$. We know that when we get the value for which $|-x+3|$ is $7$, there can\u2019t be two more values that will give us $|-x+3|=7$, since the value is limited.\nThe question asks for the least value of $x$. We can calculate this value by considering that $|3-x|$ becomes $7$. So, $|3-x|=7$ First, we have to find the positive value of $|3-x|$. So, we have $3-x=7$ or $3-x=-7$.\nWe consider the positive value first. $3-x=7$ $\\Rightarrow$ $x=3-7$$\\Rightarrow$ $x=-4$ Now, we consider the negative value. $3-x=-7$ $\\Rightarrow$ $x=10$ The question asks for the least value of $x$.
