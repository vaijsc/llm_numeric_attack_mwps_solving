        " It\u2019s best to first find the critical points of the parabola, so that we can find the vertex of the parabola.\nThe parabola $y=x^2-5$ opens upwards, so it is a maximum when the coefficients on the $x^2$ term and the constant term are the same sign.\nThe minimum distance will then occur when $x\\to\\pm\\infty$.  Between these points, we would expect there to be some $x$-value that minimizes the distance between that value and the origin.\nSo let\u2019s first find the vertex of this parabola.  The $y$-coordinate of the vertex is obtained by completing the square on the expression inside the parentheses on the right-hand side:\n$$x^2-5=\\left(x-\\frac{0}{2}\\right)^2-\\left(0-\\frac{5}{2}\\right)^2+5$$\nThis gives us the vertex of the parabola.  From this point, we can find the distance between any point on the parabola and the origin by calculating the difference $|y|$, the distance between the origin and the $x$-coordinate of the point, and then determining the greatest of the three.\nUsing the method of completing the square described above, we find that the vertex of our parabola is $(0,-5)$.  The distance between any point $(x,y)$ on the parabola and the origin is the difference of the distance from the $x$-coordinate of that point to the $y$-coordinate of that point.  From here, we can find the distance between any point on the parabola and the origin by calculating the greatest of these two distances.\nAt this point, you could just give an approximation, and that would probably be good enough.

        " \nWe need to find the point on the parabola that is closest to the origin, i.e., the minimum distance to the origin.  We know that the vertex of the parabola is the point where the tangent line is horizontal, so the vertex will be the point where the distance to the origin will be the smallest.\nThe parabola can be written in vertex form $y=a(x-h)^2+k$, so $a=1$ and $h$ is the $x$-coordinate of the vertex.  From the given equation\n$$y=x^2-5,$$we have $k=-5$, so we can now write the parabola in vertex form:\n$$y=(x-h)^2-5.$$Now, we set the derivative of the parabola with respect to $x$ to zero:\n$$2(x-h)=0\\Rightarrow x=h.$$\nAt $x=h$, the parabola has a horizontal tangent line, and the distance from the origin to the parabola is\n$$\\sqrt{(-h)^2-(-5)}=\\sqrt{h^2-5}.$$The minimum distance to the origin occurs when $x$ is the $x$-coordinate of the vertex.

        " \n1. First, we can graph the parabola $y=x^2-5$ (we can use desmos for this). The parabola opens up, so it has a minimum value at $x = 0$.\n2. The parabola has vertex $(0,-5)$ and its lowest point, so it makes sense to find the distance from $(0,-5)$ to $(x,y)$.\n3. Using distance formula, the smallest distance is $\\sqrt{(x-0)^2 + (y-(-5))^2}$.\n4. We know that $y = x^2 - 5$, so the distance is $\\sqrt{x^2 + (x^2 -5 +5)^2} = \\sqrt{x^2 + (x^2)^2} = \\sqrt{x^2 + x^4}$.\n5. Now we can simplify.

The smallest distance between the origin and a point on the parabola $y=x^2-5$ can be expressed as $\\sqrt{a}/b$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers, and $a$ is not divisible by the square of any prime.\n7. We can see from above that the smallest distance is actually $\\frac{\\sqrt{1+x^4}}{1}$.\nNow we can find $a+b$. $1$ is not divisible by the square of any prime, and it is a positive integer.

        " We can write the equation of the parabola in the form $(y-k)=ax^2$, where $(x,y)$ is a point on the parabola.  Since the smallest distance from the origin to the parabola is the smallest root of the equation, and the parabola is symmetric about the line $y=2.5$, the smallest root is between $0$ and $1$.\nTo find the smallest root, we set $y=0$, which gives us $0=x^2-5$.  The only positive root of the equation is $x=\\sqrt{5}$.  Therefore, the smallest distance from $(x,y)$ to the origin is $\\sqrt{(x-\\sqrt{5})^2+y^2}=\\sqrt{6}$.\n### Solution:\n### ",
        " \nStep 1:\nWe need to find the closest distance between the origin and the parabola $y=x^2-5$.\nStep 2:\nSince $y=x^2-5$, the distance from the origin $(0,0)$ to the parabola is $\\sqrt{(0-x)^2+(0-x^2+5)^2}=\\sqrt{x^2+(x^2-5)^2}$.\nStep 3:\nWe can simplify this expression by adding like terms and taking out a perfect square:\n$\\sqrt{x^2+(x^2-5)^2}=\\sqrt{x^2+x^4-10x^2+25}=\\sqrt{x^4-9x^2+25}$.\nStep 4:\nWe want to find the smallest possible value for this distance.  Since the distance is a positive value, if we can find the absolute minimum of this expression, that will give us the smallest possible distance.\nStep 5:\nTo find the absolute minimum, we take the derivative with respect to $x$ and set it equal to zero.  We get:\n$\\frac{d}{dx}\\sqrt{x^4-9x^2+25}=\\frac{(x^2-9)}{2\\sqrt{x^4-9x^2+25}}$.\nStep 6:\nWe can set the numerator of the expression equal to zero and solve for $x$: $x^2-9=0\\Rightarrow x^2=9\\Rightarrow x=\\pm3$.\nStep 7:\nWe need to check that $x=\\pm3$ is the absolute minimum.  We can check this by taking the second derivative: $\\frac{d^2}{dx^2}\\sqrt{x^4-9x^2+25}=2\\sqrt{x^4-9x^2+25}(-\\frac{18}{x}-6x+\\frac{2x}{x^2-9})$.\nStep 8:\nAt $x=3$, the second derivative is $\\frac{d^2}{dx^2}\\sqrt{x^4-9x^2+25}=0$, since the numerator is zero.  This is another indication that $x=3$ is the absolute minimum.\nStep 9:\nSo we know that $x=\\pm3$ are critical points.

        " Let\u2019s start by understanding what we have. We have a parabola y = x^2 - 5. We want to find the smallest distance between the origin and some point on the parabola. Let\u2019s call that point (x, y) so we know y = x^2 - 5. Notice that the smallest distance would be when the point is closest to the origin, so that would mean x^2 - 5 is closest to zero. Well, x^2 is positive for all real x so the closest we can get is to zero is when x^2 is zero. Now we need to find the value(s) of y when x^2 is zero. If x = 0, then y = -5. Since y is closest to zero when x^2 is zero, it means the minimum distance we can get is when the point is the point (0, -5), and this minimum distance is truly the smallest distance, because it\u2019s the closest. So we want to find the distance from the point (0, -5) to the origin. The distance is sqrt((0-0)^2 + (-5-0)^2) = sqrt(0 + 25) = sqrt(25) = 5. Remember, we are looking for a distance in the form of sqrt(a)/b where a and b are positive integers. So we have distance = sqrt(25) = sqrt(5^2) = sqrt((5*5)/1) = sqrt(5^2)/1 = sqrt(25)/1 = 5. We have our final answer of a + b = 5 + 1 = 6. And we know that a is not divisible by the square of any prime. So the answer is 6.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 6.

        " By completing the square of $y=x^2-5$, we can rewrite the parabola as\n\\begin{align*}\ny+5&=x^2.\n\\end{align*}Rewriting implies that $y$ has a vertex located at the point $(-0.5,5)$, so the minimum value of $y$ is $5$.  Because the distance between points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ can be computed as $\\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2}$, the distance between the origin and the point $(x,y)$ on the parabola is\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sqrt{(0-x)^2+(y-0)^2}&=\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}\n\\end{align*}Let $x^2+y^2$ write as $x^2+(x^2-5)^2=x^2+x^4-10x^2=x^2(x^2-10)$.  We can then restate that the distance between the origin and the point $(x,y)$ is\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sqrt{x^4-10x^2}.\n\\end{align*}Because the distance between any two points is never negative, the distance between the origin and a point on the parabola is always $\\sqrt{x^4-10x^2}$ for $x^2\\ge5$.  Therefore the distance between the origin and the vertex $(-0.5,5)$ is $\\sqrt{(-0.5)^4-10(-0.5)^2}=\\sqrt{5}$.\nThe target is to find the minimum distance.  In order to find this, the first derivative of the distance is to find:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{d}{dx} x^4-10x^2&=4x^3-20x\\\\\n&=4x(x^2-5)\n\\end{align*}Then, the distance is getting less as $x$ approches to zero only (not larger value of $x$), the value of $x$ that is $0$ because of $x^2-5$ curves into negative there.

Let the smallest distance between the origin and a point on the graph of the parabola $y=x^2-5$ be $\\frac{\\sqrt{a}}{",
        " To find the smallest distance between the origin and a point on the parabola $$y = x^2 - 5,$$ we wish to find the minimum value of $x^2 - 5$ as the variable $x$ varies (since distance is always positive). We complete the square to simplify the problem and find $x^2 - 5 = (x - \\sqrt{5})(x + \\sqrt{5})$; since the product of two real numbers is minimized when those numbers are equal, we conclude that $x = \\sqrt{5}$ minimizes $x^2 - 5.$ So the smallest distance between the origin and a point on the parabola $y = x^2 - 5$ is $$\\sqrt{(0 - \\sqrt{5})^2 + 5} = \\frac{\\sqrt{30}}{1} = \\frac{\\sqrt{30}}{1}.$$\n### Alternative solution:  Use a substitution like $y+5=x^2$.  Then $x^2-(y+5)=0$ when $y+5 = x^2$.  This is like a rectangle, not a rectangle in the uight sense (it is a function and a function only), but imagine like it\u2019s an infinite rectangle in the positive half plane.  In this case, let\u2019s assume that $y \\ge 0$.  Then we see that both $x$ and $y$ are increasing as $y \\to 0$.     Thus $y=0$ when $x=0$.  This means that the distance function is $$f(x) = \\sqrt{x^2-(y+5)^2} = \\sqrt{x^2-(y)}$$ It\u2019s clear that $f(x)=\\sqrt{x^2}$ for $x< -\\sqrt{5}$, and hence the minimum of $f(x)$ can be written equal to $\\sqrt{5^2} = 5$.     Then let\u2019s find the distance function, which is $\\sqrt{x^2-25}$.  Thus, the final answer is $\\boxed{30}$.\nInformation/Result here.

        " \nThe parabola opens upwards. Therefore, the smallest distance between the origin $(0,0)$ and the parabola will be achieved at the $y$-intercept, which is $(0, -5).$  The distance from the origin to the $y$-intercept is $5,$ so we can take $a=5$ and $b=1,$ and hence $a+b=\\boxed{6}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 6.

        " First, we draw the parabola $y=x^2-5$ (by running the code $fplot([x^2-5,x,t])$ in the MATH, we see the parabola). To find the smallest distance, we can first set $y=0$ and solve for $x$, which is the same as solving for the $x$-intercept(s):\n\\begin{align*}\nx^2-5 &= 0\\\\\nx^2 &= 5\\\\\nx &= \\pm\\sqrt{5}\n\\end{align*}Note that there are two $x$-intercept(s) at $x=\\pm\\sqrt{5}$. Second, we draw lines through the origin at $x=\\pm\\sqrt{5}$ and see where they intersect with the parabola.  (by running the code $fplot([x^2-5,x,t])$ in the MATH, we see the lines).  Note that these lines will be perpendicular to the parabola at the $x$-intercept(s). The distance from the origin to each intersection is the distance from the origin to the parabola.\nNext, solve for the intersection of the lines with the parabola at $x=\\pm\\sqrt{5}$.  For the line at $x=\\sqrt{5}$, it is the same as solving for the $y$-intercept:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sqrt{5}^2-5 &= y\\\\\ny &= \\sqrt{5}^2-5 = 5-5 = 0\n\\end{align*}\nSimilarly, for the line at $x=-\\sqrt{5}$, solve for $y$:\n$$(-\\sqrt{5})^2-5 = y=-\\sqrt{5}^2-5=5-5=0$$Therefore, the intersection points are $(\\sqrt{5},0)$ and $(-\\sqrt{5},0)$.\nFinally, we find the distance from the origin to the parabola at $(\\sqrt{5},0)$ and $(-\\sqrt{5},0)$.\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sqrt{(0-\\sqrt{5})^2+(0-0)^2} &= \\sqrt{(-\\sqrt{5})^2}\\\\\n&=5\\\\\n\\sqrt{(0+\\sqrt{5})^2+(0-"
