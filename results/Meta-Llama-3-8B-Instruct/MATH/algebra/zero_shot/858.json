They asked for the absolute value of the difference of the sum and the product. This can also be written as $$\\left\\vert \\frac{5}{6}-\\frac{1}{6}\\right\\vert =\\left\\vert \\frac{4}{6}\\right\\vert =\\frac{4}{6}=\\frac{2}{3}. \\label{equ:2}$$\u00a0 However, the original question asked us to express the answer in a common fraction, which is $$\\frac{2}{3}=\\frac{2}{3}.$$ So, in essence, this problem and (2) are the same. If you want to make it in a common fraction, it would be $$\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n### Source: \nI eventually found this problem from an old textbook from elementary school/stem classes, just FYI!

        " Recall that the difference of two numbers, a and b, denoted by $a-b$, is equivalent to $a+(-b)$. Now we need to figure out what the $-b$ in this case is of $a-b$ is the difference we are asked. In the problem we have different constructs $a$ and $b$, $a=\\frac{1}{2}$, and $b=\\frac{1}{3}$. ### Hint: It seems our responses have become little confusing, I think the problem has problem components it seems silly, in which case it is numerical value. So the solution of this problem is going to be a little long one. Let\u2019s find out the sum of $\\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ first.  $\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{3}=\\frac{3}{6}+\\frac{2}{6}=\\frac{5}{6}$.  Let\u2019s find out now the product of $\\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$.  $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{1}{3}=\\frac{1}{6}$. Now we can calculate the positive difference between the sum of $\\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ and the product of $\\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$; the positive difference is: $\\frac{5}{6}-\\frac{1}{6}=\\frac{4}{6}=\\frac{2}{3}$.

I hope it is correct.  ###  The given positive difference is between the sum and product of the given two fractions $\\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. \nTo find the sum, we add the given two fractions, we get \n$\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{3}$=$\\frac{3}{6}+\\frac{2}{6}$=$\\frac{5}{6}$\nTo find the product, we multiply the given two fractions, we get\n$\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{3}$=$\\frac{1}{6}$\nSo, the positive difference between the sum of $\\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ and the product of $\\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ is\n$\\frac{5}{6}-\\frac{1}{6}$=$\\frac{4}{6}$=$\\frac{2}{3}$\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$.\n### Programming and Coding\n## Finding an Expression for the Sum of the First $n$ Natural Numbers by Induction\nConsider the two expressions $f(n) = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ and $g(n) = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n$. The goal is to prove that $f(n) = g(n)$ for all $n \\ge 1$ using mathematical induction.\nBase Case: $n = 1$:\n$$f(1) = \\frac{1(1+1)}{2} = 1 = g(1)$$\nHence, the base case holds.\nInductive Step:\nAssume $f(k) = g(k)$ for",
        " First, we find the sum of $\\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} &= \\frac{2\\cdot 3 + 3 \\cdot 2}{2\\cdot 3}\\\\\n&= \\frac{6+6}{6}\\\\\n&= \\frac{12}{6}\\\\\n&= 2\n\\end{align*}\nThen, we find the product of $\\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} &= \\frac{1 \\cdot 3}{2 \\cdot 3}\\\\\n&= \\frac{3}{6}\\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2}\n\\end{align*}\nSo, the positive difference between the sum and the product is $2-\\frac{1}{2} = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\frac{3}{2}. I hope it is correct. \\blacktriangle"
