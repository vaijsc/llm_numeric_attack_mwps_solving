        " Fri, Nov 18 2022, 5:42 PM\n### Answer: To find the total amount after 18 years of interest, calculate the accumulated interest for each of the 18 years and then add that to the initial $\\$2000$.  For each year, calculate the interest as the initial amount times the rate times the time.  In this case, the initial amount is $\\$2000$, the rate is $0.05$ (or 5%), and the time is 1 year.  So for the first year, the interest will be $2000\\cdot 0.05\\cdot 1=100.$So after that year, the total amount would be $2000+100 = 2100.$For the second year, the interest will again be $0.05$ times the new total amount, $2100$, times the year\u2019s duration, 1: so the interest for the second year is $2100\\cdot 0.05\\cdot 1=105,$for a total of $2100 + 105 = 2205$.  We would continue doing this for the 18 years until the end result is the total accumulated amount.\nAfter the first year, the interest is $100$ so the total is $\\$2100.$\nAfter the second year the interest is $105$ and the total is $\\$2205.$\nAfter the third year the interest is $\\$110.50$and the total is $\\$2315.50.$And this pattern continues.  By trying to write down a pattern you could guess the total after the 18 years to be$2000\\cdot1.05^{18}=3009.50.$This is correct because with each further year, you are adding one more to the exponent in your initial value.  The$1.05^{18}$is just the same thing as$(1.05)^{1} + (1.05)^{2} + (1.05)^{3} \\cdots + (1.05)^{18}.$Frederick will have$\\$3009.50$after he can collect the money.\n### Final Answer: The final answer is \\$3009.50.

This process continues for$18-1=17$years. Thus, the amount of money Frederick will have when he can collect the money at the age of$18$is$$2000\\cdot(1.05)^{17}=\\boxed{\\$3623.99108\\dots}.$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\$3623.99108\\dots.

The rate of return on the account is$5\\%$per year, so the interest at the end of one year is$5\\%\\cdot2000 = 100, and the value of the account at the end of one year is$\\$2100.$  Since the interest is added to the account at the end of the year, the value of the account at the end of the second year is $2100 + 0.05 \\cdot 2100 = 2205$ and the value of the account at the end of the third year is $2205 + 0.05 \\cdot 2205 = 2312.5.$  In general, the value of Frederick's account after$n$years can be found by the formula$\\left(\\\u041f\u043e\u0434\u0434\u043e\u7684\u5c0f\u53f7\u0e49\u0e15enti-2000\\right)1.05^{n-1} + 2000.$In fact, we can express this more generally as a sum:$$F(n) = 2000 + 2000 \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \\left( 0.05 \\right)^i.$$Noting that$\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} x^i = \\frac{1-x^n}{1-x},$we can rewrite this sum as\\begin{align*}F(n) &= 2000 + 2000 \\frac{(0.05)^1-(0.05)^n}{1-0.05}\\\\\n&= \\frac{2000(1-0.05^n)}{0.95",

        " To calculate how much money Frederick will have at age 18, we need to find how much money is in the account after 18 years of interest being added. The first step is to calculate how much money is in the account after the first year. At the end of the first year, Frederick will have an amount of money in the account equal to the initial $\\$2000$plus an additional amount due to the 5% interest.  So, at the end of the first year, Frederick will have$\\$2000+\\$2000\\cdot0.05=\\$2100$.  We can continue in this way to find the principal in the account at the end of any given year.  Therefore, the principal in the account at the end of the second year is$2100+\\$2100\\cdot0.05=\\$2105$, the principal at the end of the third year is$2105+\\$2105\\cdot0.05=\\$2215.25$, and so on.  Using this pattern, we can calculate the principal in the account at the end of the 18th year as follows:\\begin{align*} &2000+[2000\\cdot0.05]^1+\\cdots+[2000\\cdot0.05]^{17}+[2000\\cdot0.05]^{18}= \\\\ &\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\$2000+(0.05\\cdot\\$2000)\\bigl(1+\\frac{1}{1.05}+\\dots+(\\frac{1.05}{1.05})^{17}\\bigr) \\\\ &\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad=(0.05)(\\$2000)\\left(\\frac{1-\\bigl(\\frac{1.05}{1.05}\\bigr)^{18}}{1-1.05}+1000\\right) \\\\ &\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad=(0.05)(\\$2000)(\\frac{1-1.05^{-18}}{0.05}(1.05)+1000)\\\\ &=\\$2690.64+1000 \\end{align*}And so, Frederick will have$\\$2690.64+\\$",
        " At the end of the first year, the money will grow by $5\\%$ of $\\$2000$to be $2000\\cdot\\left(1+\\frac{0.05}{1}\\right)=2100.$At the end of the second year, the money will grow by$5\\%$of$\\$2100$ to be $2100\\cdot\\left(1+\\frac{0.05}{1}\\right)=2205.$\nAt the end of the third year, the money will grow by $5\\%$ of $\\$2205$ to be$2205\\cdot\\left(1+\\frac{0.05}{1}\\right)=2312.5.$Continuing this process, we have \\begin{align*} I_1 &= $2000, I_2 =$2100$,$I_3 =$2205$,$$...$, $I_{18} =$2593.75$.\nSo Frederick will have $\\$2593.75$at the end of the 18th year. He still needs to make them pay out the initial amount of$\\$2000$, so the total he will have is $2593.75+2000=\\boxed{\\$4593.75}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $4593.75$.

        " First, the interest rate is expressed in decimal form, which is $r = 0.05$.  The investment of $\\$ 2000$can be written as the function$f(t)=2000+0.05\\cdot 2000\\cdot t$where$0.05$gives us the interest rate in decimal form.  We can rewrite this as$f(t)=2000(1+0.05t).$In order to evaluate this at age$18, we need to substitute in$t=18$.$F(18)=2000(1+0.05(18))=2000(1+0.9)=2000\\cdot1.9=\\boxed{\\$3800}$.

Final Answer: The final answer is 2180. I hope it is correct. Thanks in advance. I think I did this problem incorrectly again. I was hoping my response would be 3800, but I think I made a mistake. Am I correct that the interest is compounded annually? In that case, shouldn't the equation be $P\\cdot (1+r)^n$, where $P$is the principal, $r$is the interest rate, and $n$is the number of years? So, in this case, $r=0.05$, $n=18$, and $P=2000$, so the equation becomes $2000\\cdot (1+0.05)^{18} = 3826.60$. Is this correct? If so, isn't the answer actually $\\$3826.60$?

        " 1) Determine the number of years it will take for Frederick to be 18, which is from his birth until he can get the money.  This is $18-0=18$ years.  2) The amount invested is$\\2000$.  3) The interest rate is$5\\%$, which is a percentage, so we need to convert this to a decimal by dividing by $100$, so the decimal for the interest rate is $0.05$.  4) The formula for simple interest is $\\ hiding401bc74b4a17eaca82f5a384b41da57633ed2d physI = P*r*t$, where $\\ physI$ is the interest, $P$ is the principal, $r$ is the rate, and $t$ is the time.  In this case, the principal is $P = 2000$, the rate is $r = 0.05$, and the time is $t = 18$.  Plugging this into the formula gives $\\physI = 2000*(0.05)*18 = 1800$.
