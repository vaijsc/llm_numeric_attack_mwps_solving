We now find the solution for x: x = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)]/2a, in this case x = [-0 \u00b1 sqrt(-(16 + p))] / 2 = \u00b1i(sqrt(4p + 16)) / 2. The real part of this solution is zero and so this equation does not provide any values of x.\nTherefore, we now focus on the first equation: x^2 - 16 = p. We put p = 2, then x^2 - 16 = 2, x^2 = 18. Now x = \u00b1\u221a18. We know that the square root of an even number always ends with 0, 2, 4, 6 or 8. So, \u221a18 = 4.29 (rounded) Not feasible. We also know that the square root of a perfect square always ends with 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9 or 25. So, x = \u00b1\u221a18 = \u00b1\u221a9 * \u221a2. We know that \u221a9 = 3 and \u221a2 is equal to 1.414 (rounded). So, the possible values for x are 3.414 and -3.414.\nLet\u2019s state the conclusion: |x^2 - 16| = 2 gives us two integer values for x. The product of the two values for x is: 3.414",
        " If $x^2-16$ is an odd number, it can never be prime, because every odd number bigger than 1 is divisible by 3 and/or 5.\nIf $x^2-16$ is even, then write it as $2k$ where $k$ is an integer. Then $x^2-16=2k$ gives $x^2-2k-16=0$. Now factoring, we get $(x-2\\sqrt{k}+4)(x+2\\sqrt{k}+4)=0$. Note that the solution $x+2\\sqrt{k}+4=0$ never has an integer solution. Hence, we are left only with $x-2\\sqrt{k}+4=0$, which yields two integer solutions: $x=(2\\sqrt{k}-4)\\pm2\\sqrt{k}$. Thus, we need to check whether $k=2$ or $k=3$ (when $\\pm$ in the solution above is 1).\nFor $k=2$, we get $x^2-16=4$, which is not prime.\nFor $k=3$, we get $x^2-16=6$, which is not prime again.\nSo, the initial assumption of $x^2-16$ being an even number does not give us a prime $(x^2-16)$.\nOn the other hand, when $x^2-16$ is odd, $x^2-16=2k+1$, then $x^2-2k-16=0$, which factors into $(x-2\\sqrt{k}+4)(x+2\\sqrt{k}+3)=0$. Again, we don\u2019t get an integer solution from $x+2\\sqrt{k}+3=0$. So, we have $x-2\\sqrt{k}+4=0$, which yields the solutions $(2\\sqrt{k}-4)\\pm 2\\sqrt{k}$, for $\\pm =\\pm 1$.\nFor $\\pm =-1$, we obtain $x=(2\\sqrt{k}-4)-2\\sqrt{k}$ and $x=(2\\sqrt{k}-4)+2\\sqrt{k}$, which evaluates to $x=-2\\sqrt{k}-4$ and $x=4$ respectively. Since the product is $16$, which is a prime, this gives one solution $x=4$.\nFor",
        " we know that the square root of 16 is \u00b1 4. So |x^2 \u2013 16| = x^2 \u2013 16 and x^2 \u2013 16 = x2 \u2013 4^2 when we can rewrite it in the form (x \u2013 a)(x + a) = x2 \u2013 a^2 and this is a difference of two squares form. (x \u2013 4)(x + 4) = x^2 \u2013 16. any integer greater than 1 can be factored into primes. So all prime integers will only have two factors. However, 2 is prime, so how do we ensure that we only consider prime integers greater than 1?\n### ",
        " \nThe first step is to write $|x^2 - 16|$ as $x^2-16$.  Now let us solve when $x^2-16$ is equal to a prime number.  For instance, if we set $x^2-16=2$, then $x^2=18$, and this gives $x=\\pm\\sqrt{18}$, but since $x$ is an integer, this does not give an integer solution.  If we set $x^2-16=3$, then $x^2=19$, and this gives $x=\\pm\\sqrt{19}$, but since $x$ is an integer, this does not give an integer solution.  If we set $x^2-16=5$, then $x^2=21$, and this does not give an integer solution.  If we set $x^2-16=7$, then $x^2=23$, and this does not give an integer solution.\n However, if we set $x^2-16=13$, then $x^2=29$, and this gives $x=\\pm\\sqrt{29}$, since $29$ is not a perfect square, this would give the two integer values for $x$ for which $|x^2 - 16|$ is equal to a prime number.",

        " \nTo have the absolute value $|x^2 - 16|$ being a prime number, we have two cases:\n(i) $x^2-16 = k$ with $k>0$ where $k$ is prime number.\n(ii) $x^2-16 = -k$ with $k>0$ where $k$ is prime number.\nConsider the first case. For that case we have $x^2 = 16+k$, so $(x+8)(x-8) = k$. Hence we have $(x+8) = 1$ and $(x-8) = p$ or $(x+8) = p$ and $(x-8) = 1$.\nFirst, let $(x+8) = 1$ and $(x-8) = p$. Then, $x=8-1 = 7$ and $x=-8+7=-1$ are the solution for this case.\nNext, let $(x+8) = p$ and $(x-8) = 1$. Then, $x=8-1 = 7$ and $x=-8+7=-1$ are also the same two solution as before.\nNow, let\u2019s come to the second case. We have $16+x^2 = k$ so $(x+4)^2 = k+16$. Based on the fact that $k$ is prime number, we have two cases again:\n(iii) $(x+4)^2 = p$ where $p$ is prime number.\n(iv) $(x+4)^2 = k$ where $p$ is prime number.\nConsider third case. Then, $x+4 = \\sqrt{p}$ or $x+4 = \\pm \\sqrt{k}$ respectively. The first case does not have a real number solution. The second case will give $x = \\pm \\sqrt{k-16}$. But we have been told that $|x^2 - 16|$ is prime number. This case does not fit the requirement. Hence $x = \\sqrt{p-16}$ and $x = -\\sqrt{p-16}$ is the solution for this case.\nCombining the three cases above, we have the total 4 solutions for $x = \\pm 7$ and $x = \\pm \\sqrt{p-16}$ where $p$ is a prime number.\nBy checking each of them, we have $|4-",
        " \nSince we know the expression $|x^2-16|$ represents the absolute value of the difference between $x^2$ and $16,$ we know $|x^2 - 16|$ will only be a prime number when the absolute value of $x^2 - 16$ is a prime number. In other words, we are looking for values of $x$ such that $x^2 - 16$ itself is a prime number.\nIf $x^2-16$ is a prime, then it must be equal to $2,$ $3,$ $5,$ $7,$ $11,$ etc. For $x^2-16=2$, we can solve for $x$:\n\\begin{align*}\nx^2-16&=2\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x^2&=18\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x&=\\pm\\sqrt{18}=\\pm\\sqrt{9}\\sqrt{2}=\\pm3\\sqrt{2}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x&=\\pm 3\\sqrt{2}\n\\end{align*}Now, when $x$ is positive, $x^2 - 16 > 0,$ so $|x^2 - 16| = x^2 - 16$. When $x$ is negative, $x^2 - 16 < 0,$ so $|x^2 - 16| = 16 - x^2$.

Let me help you with your math problems or give you some suggestions on how to improve your problem-solving skills. What is the product of the two integer values for $x$ for which $|x^2 - 16|$ is a prime number?\nThis appears to be a prime number problem. So let's start by identifying the important characteristics of prime numbers.\nA prime number is a positive integer that is divisible only by itself and 1. For example, the prime factors of 7 are only 7 and 1.\nIn order to solve this problem, we need to find two values of $x$ for which $|x^2 - 16|$ is a prime number. We can do this by examining the values of $|x^2 - 16|$ for different values of $x$.\nFirst, let's consider the values of $|x^2 - 16|$ for $x = 1, -1, ",
        " \n$|x^2 - 16| = |(x-4)(x+4)|$ is a prime number if and only if $(x-4)(x+4)$ is a prime number, since $|x^2-16|=\\pm (x^2-16)$. Suppose that $(x-4)(x+4)$ is a prime number. Then, either $(x-4)=1$ and $(x+4)=1$ or $(x-4)=2$ and $x+4=2$ or $(x-4)=3$ and $(x+4)=3$ or $(x-4)=5$ and $(x+4)=5$. If $(x-4)=1$ and $(x+4)=1$, then $x=0$, which is not a solution for $x^2-16\\neq0$. If $(x-4)=2$ and $(x+4)=2$, then $x=2$, yielding $x^2-16=4-16=-12$, which is not a prime number. If $(x-4)=3$ and $(x+4)=3$, then $x=1$, yielding $x^2-16=1-16=-15$, which is not a prime number. If $(x-4)=5$ and $(x+4)=5$, then $x=3$, yielding $x^2-16=9-16=-7$, which is not a prime number. So no possible solution is found.  The problem says that $x^2-16$ is a prime number. Since $x^2-16=(x-4)(x+4)$, it follows that $(x-4)(x+4)$ is a prime number if and only if $x^2-16$ is a prime number. But we showed earlier that there are no solutions for this, because $x^2-16$ is never a prime number when $x\\neq 0$, so must be determined that the problem is different from the first one. Therefore, we solve $x^2-16=\\pm m$, where $m$ is prime. $x^2-16=(x-4)(x+4)=x^2-16$ is prime if and only if $x=3$ or $x=-3$. But, $x^2-16=-12$, when $x=3$, and $",

Thus, $p+16$ must be the square of an integer $2k+1$ which gives $p=2k^2+2k$, which is an even number, which cannot be a prime number. Now we consider $x^2-16=-p$. By rearranging, we have that $x^2=-p+16$. This time, $p-16$ must be the square of an integer $2k$, which gives $p=2k^2$, the square of an even integer, which can also not be a prime number. Thus $|x^2-16|$ can never be a prime number. But wait, $x^2$ is definitely a perfect square and we know that 16, the difference between two perfect squares, is definitely prime, so we have reached a contradiction. Thus, we can say that the expression $|x^2-16|$ can never be a prime number, so it must be equal to 10, and the unit digit must be $0$ since $|x^2-16|$ is equal to $4, or 10,$ or $16$. What happens if we take away the absolute value from the expression? We obtain the equation $\\begin{equation*} x^2=16. \\end{equation*}$\nSolving this equation helps in finding those values of $x$ for which the unit digit is $0$. By taking away $\\pm4$ from $\\pm4$, the square of $4$, we obtain $\\begin{equation*} x=\\pm 4. \\end{equation*}$\nThus, the values for $x$ are $+4$ and $-4$. $\\boxed{16}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 16. I hope it is correct.  Final Answer: The final answer is 16. I hope",
        " The first step to tackle this problem is to factor the expression which is equal to $|x^2 - 16|$. Notice that this expression must be non-negative because we are dealing with its absolute value.\nNow, $$|x^2 - 16| = |(x+4)(x-4)|.$$To solve this, we have two choices, either $x$ is greater than 4, so that $x-4$ is positive and $x+4$ is also positive. In this case, $|x^2-16| = x^2 -16 = (x+4)(x-4)$. This occurs when $x = 6$. Another case is when $x< -4$, so that $x+4$ is negative and $x-4$ is also negative. In this case, $|x^2-16| = 16 - x^2 = (x+4)(x-4)$. This also occurs when $x= -6$.\nSo, we have two solutions: $x = - 6$ and $x = 6$. Both of them lead us to a prime number, $|x^2-16| = 8$. So, the product of them is $6 \\cdot -6 = \\boxed{-36}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -36. I hope it is correct. Thank you.  ### Related Post 1. Math problem solution | 2021-10-14 2.

        " Well, since $16 = 4^2,$ we can simplify the expression $|x^2 - 16|$ as follows:\\begin{align*} |x^2 - 16| & = |x - 4||x + 4|^{\\color{redder]{\\text{(1)}}}\\\\ \\text{for }x & \\ge 0 \\\\ |x^2 - 16| & = (x - 4)x + 4|^{\\color{redder}{\\text{(2)}}}\\\\ |x^2 - 16| & = \\begin{cases} x^2 - 8x + 16 & \\text{or}\\\\ x^2 + 8x + 16 & \\text{for }x < 0. \\end{cases}\\end{align*}Notice that if $|x^2 - 16|$ is a prime number, then by inspection, it must be an odd number.  Therefore, in equation $(\\color{redder}{\\text{(2)}}),$ we have that $x^2 - 8x + 16 = (x - 4)^2 = 1,$ so $x$ must be $3$ or $4.$  This means the product of the two integer values for $x$ is $\\boxed{12}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 12.

        " If we fix the value of x, the value of $x^2 - 16$ is constant. A constant that is prime is a single digit number and less than 10. ## Basic Properties of Modulus We always use simple modulus problems to solve such type questions. But this question seems a bit different, and looks like it is asking we to solve a mod. an equation not exactly a mod. an equation but we can solve it in the same manner.$$|x^2 - 16| = p$$\nNow we know that it is an absolute value equation. It means, whatever we get inside the modulus, positive it will take.\nIf the value of $x^2 - 16$ is positive, then it will be equal to $p$. Then,$$x^2 - 16 = p$$\nHopefully we get one solution now. If we don\u2019t get any solution here, that means, the value of $x^2 - 16$ is negative.\n$x^2 - 16 = -p$\nHere, we get one more solution.\n### Case 1: $x^2 - 16 = p$:\nSimplify the equation.$$x^2 - 16 = p$$ $$x^2 = 16 + p$$ $$x^2 = 4^2 + p$$ If $p$ is a prime number, that means all factors of $p$ are 1 and $p$. But we are looking for a small number because $p$ is a single digit number.\nSo, $p = 2, 3, 5, 7$. If we substitute any of these values into $x^2 = 4^2 + p$, we get:\nCase 1.1: $p = 2$ $$x^2 = 4^2 + 2$$ $$x^2 = 18$$ No real solution.\nCase 1.2: $p = 3$ $$x^2 = 4^2 + 3$$ $$x^2 = 19$$ No real solution.\nCase 1.3: $p = 5$ $$x^2 = 4^2 + 5$$ $$x^2 = 21$$ No real solution.\nCase 1.4: $p = 7$ $$x^2 = 4^2 + 7$$ $$x^2 = 21$$ No real solution.\nNo solution.\n### Case 2: $",

        "PurpleMath\nThe question asks about the product of the integer values of $x$ for which $|x^2 - 16|$ is a prime number. So first let\u2019s look at the equation $|x^2 - 16|$.\nConsider the factored form and try to find a prime $k$. Then rewrite $x^2 - 16$ as it. Factoring $x^2 - 16$ as $(x+4)(x-4)$:\n\\begin{align*} |x^2 - 16|&=|(x+4)(x-4)| \\end{align*} Now, either $x + 4$ and $x - 4$ are both even, both odd, or one is even and the other odd. Let\u2019s analyze each case separately.\nCase $1$: $x+4$ and $x-4$ are both even. This gives $x + 4 = 2a$ and $x - 4 = 2b$. From here, we can solve $x = 2(a+b)$. The absolute value is even in this case, so we rule out this case.\nCase $2$: $x+4$ and $x-4$ are both odd. This gives $x+4 = 2c+1$ and $x-4 = 2c+1$. Solving $x$ here, we have $x=2c+1+4=2c+5$. Now, note $|x^2-16|$ in this case: $|x^2-16|=|(x+4)(x-4)|=|(2c+5+4)(2c+5-4)|=|(2c+9)(2c+1)|=|4c+9c+18|\\ge 4c+18 > 0$, which is not prime.\nCase $3$: One of $x+4$ and $x-4$ is even, and the other is odd. Say $x+4$ is even, as the case when $x-4$ is even is similar. So, we get $x+4=2c$ and $x-4=2d+1$. This gives us $x=2c+4$.\nFirst, we consider the positive case: $$|x^2-16|=|(2c+4)^2-16|=|4c^2+16",

        " So we have that $x^2 - 16 \\ge 0.$\nFrom $x^2 - 16 \\ge 0$ we get $x < -4$ or $x \\ge 4.$\nFrom $|x^2 - 16| = 16 - x^2$ we get that we need to find integers $x$ such that $16 - x^2$ is a prime.\n### ",
        " \nWhen $x$ is even, $x^2$ is even, so $|x^2 - 16|$ is even. Therefore, $|x^2 - 16|$ can not be prime for even values of $x$.\nWhen $x$ is odd, $x^2$ is odd, so $|x^2 - 16|$ can be either even or odd. It remains to classify when $|x^2-16|$ is even or odd for odd values of $x$. We can do this using the fact that $|x^2-16|=| (x+4)(x-4) |$.\nIf one of the factors $(x-4)$ or $(x+4)$ is even, then $|x^2-16|$ is even. For example, when $x=6$, $|x^2-16|=|6^2-16|=|36-16|=20$, which is even.\nIf both $(x-4)$ and $(x+4)$ are odd, then $|x^2-16|$ is odd. For example, when $x=7$, $|x^2-16|=|(7+4)(7-4)|=|(11)(3)|=33$, which is odd.\nSo $|x^2-16|$ is even when $x$ is odd, and odd when $x$ is an odd square root of a number of form $2^k$ where $k\\ge 1$ (assuming $x$ is an integer).\nAfter some trial, we find that $|x^2-16|=7$ when $x=3$, and $|x^2-16|=3$ when $x=5$. So the two values for $x$ are $x_1=3$ and $x_2=5$. The product of these values is $3\\times5=\\boxed{15}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 15.
