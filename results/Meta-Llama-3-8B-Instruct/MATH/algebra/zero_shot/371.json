        " Let\u2019s start with the radius of the circle, denoted by $r$. The distance between the center point and a point on the circle is the radius.

Find the slope between the points $(-1, 2)$, $(9, 0)$. $m_{2}=\\frac{0-2}{9-(-1)}=\\frac{-2}{10}=-\\frac{1}{5}$\n3. We know that the slope of perpendicular lines is the negative reciprocal of each other. We can assume that these points can form the equations of two lines.\n    * $\\textbf{Line (1)}: y-2=-\\frac{1}{2}(x+1)\\iff y=-\\frac{1}{2}x+\\frac{3}{2}$\n    * $\\textbf{Line (2)}: y-2=-\\frac{1}{5}(x+1)\\iff y=-\\frac{1}{5}x+\\frac{21}{10}$\nSo of the lines intersect each other and the circle is located exactly at the point where they intersect.",
        " 1\nFirst, notice that the perpendicular distance of the point from the line is the same around the circle. This means that for point $P(-1,2)$: we should find the perpendicular distance from $P$ to the line passing through $(3,0)$ and $(9,0)$, which is $y=0$. We have to find the point $Q$ of the intersection of these lines. This will give us the shortest distance. The point $Q$ co-ordinates are:\n$\\begin{array}{lcl} x_{Q}&=&(9+3)/2=6 \\\\ y_{Q}&=&0 \\\\ \\end{array}$\nThe distance between $P$ and $Q$:\n$\\begin{array}{lcl} \\Delta d&=& \\sqrt{(x_{2}-x_{1})^{2}+(y_{2}-y_{1})^{2}} \\\\ &=& \\sqrt{(6-(-1))^{2}+(0-2)^{2}} \\\\ &=& \\sqrt{(7)^{2}+(-2)^{2}} \\\\ &=& \\sqrt{49+4} \\\\ &=& 7 \\end{array}$\nSimilarly, the perpendicular distance for point $P(3,0)$ will be the same, 7.\n### ",
        " Let\u2019s start by calculating the slope of the line formed by the two points $(-1, 2)$ and $(3,0)$. It is $\\frac{0-2}{3-(-1)} = \\frac{-2}{4}=-\\frac{1}{2}.$ Similarly, we calculate the slope of the line formed by the two points $(-1, 2)$ and $(9,0)$ to be $\\frac{0-2}{9-(-1)} = \\frac{-2}{10}=-\\frac{1}{5}.$ These two slopes are the same, so the center of the circle lies on a line with slope $-\\frac{1}{2}$ that is perpendicular to this line. Similarly, it lies on a line with slope $-\\frac{1}{5}$ that is perpendicular to this line. The lines of these slopes will form the ``arms'' of this right angle triangle. Because they are perpendicular, the product of the slopes will be $-1$.\nSo $\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(-\\frac{1}{5}\\right)=\\frac{1}{10}$. Therefore the center must be $(-\\frac{1}{20},-\\frac{1}{2})$. $h$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{-1}{20}}$ and $k$ is $\\boxed{-\\frac{1}{2}}$. $h+k$ is thus $\\boxed{-\\frac{21}{20}}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -\\frac{21}{20}. I hope it is correct.### End of "
