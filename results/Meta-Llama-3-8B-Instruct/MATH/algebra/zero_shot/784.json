If r = k + \\frac{1}{2} where k is an integer, then we have 5^{2k + 1-3} = 5^2 5^{2k} = 5^2 => 2k = 2 => k = 1, so r = 1.5. In summary, we have solutions r = 2.5 and r = 1.5. As for k < 0, then you would have 5^{2|k| -3} = 5^2 5^{2|k|} = 5^2 => 2|k| = 2 => |k| = 1 => k = -1 => r = -0.5. So for k < 0, we have r = -0.5, but that is out of the domain.

        " For $5^{2r-3} = 25$, we have to see what can be put under the base of the base $5$ to have a power that is equal to 25. Now, let us convert $25$ to base 5: $25 = 1(5^2) + 0(5^1) + 0(5^0)$. So, we need to have a power that is $5^2$. How can we get $5^2$ in the base $5$? Let\u2019s look at $r$.\n### Step 1: Pattern recognition\nIf we write $2r-3$ in terms of powers of 5, we can use the following pattern:\n\\begin{align*}\n&2r-3 = 2r - 2 + 1 \\\\\n&= 2(r-1) + 1 \\\\\n&= 2(5^1-1) + 1 \\\\\n&= \\boxed{5^2} \\\\\n&\\therefore\\;\\; 5^{5^2} = 25.\n\\end{align*}\n### Step 2: Concluding the result\nThe above pattern shows that if we take $2r-3 = 5^2$, then the equation $5^{2r-3} = 25$ will be true.

        "  First, $5^{2r-3} = 25$. So, we need to find all values of $r$ such that this equation holds. The right side is $25$ which is equal to $5^2$ so, it can be rewritten as: $5^{2r-3} = 5^2$. Now, this tells us that $(2r-3) = 2$. To keep our solutions simple, we want to get rid of the $2$. Subtracting 2 from both sides: $2r-3 = 2$ $2r = 5$ $r = 5/2$ The fraction $5/2$ is not in our decimal form, so we will divide $5$ by $2$ and write it as $2.5$. Therefore, $2.5$ is the solution to $5^{2r-3} = 25$. So, $r = 2.5$\nWe chose to express the decimal solution as a mixed number because our numbers given are in terms of $r$, whereas $\\frac{5}{2}$ would be a more accurate representation in this particular problem.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2.5.

        " Solution 1-1\nWe are given that $5^{2r-3} = 25$.\nWe need to change the right side to match the left side. The exponents should match, so we use$25 = 5^2$.\nNow the expression can be$5^{2r-3} = 5^2$.\nIn order for the exponents to match, $2r-3$ must be equal to 2. We add $3$ to both sides to get$2r=5$.\nThen, we divide both sides by 2 to find the$racial value r = \\frac{5}{2}$. The fraction is simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by$2, so r = 2.5.\nThe value r = 2.5 is the solution to the problem.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2.5.

So, we have$5^{2r-3}=5^2 \\implies 2r-3 = 2 \\implies 2r = 5 \\implies r = 2.5 This results in to$ r = 2.5$. Final Answer: The final answer is 2.5. I hope it is correct. Solution 2-2\n### Conclusion\nThe problem asks us to find the values of $r$ such that $5^{2r-3} = 25$. After solving the equation, we find that the value of $r$ that satisfies the equation is $2.5$. This value of $r$ makes the exponents match, and thus satisfies the equation.  Final Answer: The final answer is r = 2.5. I hope it is correct.  The result is $r = 2.5$. Final Answer: The final answer is 2.5. I hope it is correct. Final Answer: The final answer is 2.5. I hope it is correct. Final Answer: The final answer is r = 2.5. I hope it is correct.
