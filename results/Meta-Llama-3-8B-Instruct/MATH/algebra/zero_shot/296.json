Let's write our system as $$\\begin{cases}\n2ax+2y&=b,\\\\\n10x+2y&=-6.\n\\end{cases}$$From the second equation, we obtain $2y = -6 - 10x$, which we can simplify to $$y = -3 - 5x.$$ Now we substitute this expression for $y$ into the first equation: \\begin{align*}\n2ax + 2(-3) - 10x &= b\\\\\n2ax - 6 - 8x &= b\\\\\n2ax - 8x &= b + 6\\\\\n-6x &= b + 6\\\\\nx &= \\frac{b+6}{6}.\n\\end{align*}Now we substitute this back into our expression for $y$: $$y = -3 - 5 \\cdot \\frac{b+6}{6} = -3 - \\frac{5}{6}b - \\frac{5}{3}.$$\nSo, for each value of $(a, b)$, we can solve for $(x, y)$.\nThe first requirement is that there be an infinite number of solutions for $(x, y)$ for this system. So we must find a value $(a, b)$ that makes the denominator of the expression for $y$ equal to zero. Let's rewrite our expression for $y$ in terms of $a, b$:\n$$y = -3 - \\frac{5}{6}b - \\frac{5}{3}a.$$We're looking for when the denominator of this is zero, so let's assume the expression $-\\frac{5}{6}b - \\frac{5}{3}a$ is zero:\n$$-\\frac{5}{6}b - \\frac{5}{3}a = 0\\Leftrightarrow b = \\frac{5}{2}a.$$We can summarize this by saying that for a solution where there are infinite solutions for the $(x, y)$ in the system to be true, then $b$ must equal $\\frac{5}{2}a.$\nIf we substitute this expression back into the first equation, we can see that this is satisfied for the ordered",
        " \nFor simplicity, let $a$ and $b$ be integers. We may solve the second equation for $y$ to obtain $y=-5x-3$. Plugging this into the first equation yields\n$$\n2a x+2(-5x-3)=b,\n$$which simplifies to\n$$\n2ax-10x-6=b,\n$$\n$$\n\\Rightarrow (2a-10)x=-6+b.\n$$We seek $(a, b)$ such that the above equation has an infinite number of integer solutions $x$.  This occurs exactly when $2a-10=0$, so $a=5$, and the right-hand side is equal to $0$, so $b=-6$. Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{(5,-6)}$.\n### Explanation: \nSolving for $y$ from the second equation allows us to express $y$ in terms of $x$. Plugging this into the first equation simplifies the expression. Since we seek an infinite number of integer solutions $x$, we require the linear term in $x$ to be equal to $0$, yielding $2a-10=0$, which gives $a=5$. Furthermore, since $x$ must be an integer solution, the constant term must also be an integer solution, which gives $b=0$. However, this gives a contradiction, since $b=-6$ is a solution to the system. Hence, the answer is $\\boxed{(5,-6)}$. The key idea here is that we need an infinite number of solutions, so the $x$-coefficient needs to be $0$. The constant term needs to be an integer, but there is a contradiction for this choice of $b$. Therefore, the correct answer is $(5, -6)$, where $b = -6$ is the correct constant term. Alternatively, we could also see that as a sanity check to check if the two equations satisfy at the origin. Therefore, the other choices $(1, -3), (2, -2), (3, -1)$ do not work.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is (5,-6). I hope it is correct.",
        " \nI will assume that you have already solved systems of two linear equations in two variables. If not, I would recommend you to practice and learn how to solve them.\nThe given system of equations is:\n\\begin{align*}\n2ax+2y&=b,\\\\\n5x+y&=-3.\n\\end{align*}\nThe first step is to solve the second equation for $y$:\n$$y=-5x-3.$$Now, substitute $y$ into the first equation:\n$$2ax+2(-5x-3)=b.$$Now we can simplify it:\n$$2ax-10x-6=b,$$and combine like terms:\n$$-8x=b-6.$$In order to make sense of this equation, we need to ask ourselves: What if $b$ is a multiple of $6$? Think of it like this, if $c$ is a constant, $b=6c$, and when we multiply both sides of the equation by $c$, $-8xc=6c-6c=0,$ which means $x$ has infinite solutions. This implies that $x$ can be anything.\nNow, we need a way to relate $a$ and $b$. Let's multiply both sides of our equation by $-c$:\n$$8xc=-6c$$\nand simplify:\n$$x=-\\frac34c$$\nNow we can see that $x$ is a multiple of $\\frac34$. If we want $x$ to be able to have infinite solutions, then we need $\\frac34$ to be gratuits to $a$, which means $a$ is a multiple of $\\frac34$. This means that for whatever constant $c$ we choose, we will have a solution to the system of equations. To qualify the order pair $(a,b)$, it is best to express it in a standard form and choose $a=\\frac34$ and $b=c$.

So, we need the equation $5-bx=x$ to have infinite solutions. This is exactly what happens when $b=5$ and $a$ can be anything we want. So, there are infinite solutions if and only if $a$ and $b$ satisfy $(a,b)=(\\boxed{0,5})$.\n### Conclusion: Therefore, the correct ordered pair is $\\boxed{(0,5)}$. The solution will show that for b=5, a =0 the system has infinite solutions, because the expression b-2ax is constant. This can be achieved by taking b=5 and a=0, giving $y=5-0x$ in the first equation, and that expression in the second equation. The equation $5-bx=x $( $y=5-2ax$) has infinite solutions for b=5. Therefore the system has infinite solutions for $(a,b)=(0,5)$",

        " To find infinite solutions, there must be some relation between the given equations. Because, if there is no relation, the system will have no solution. So, one equation will be a linear combination of the other. We will start by multiplying the second equation by 2, then we get $2(5x+y)=2(-3)$ => $10x+2y=-6$. We divide both sides by 2, then we get $5x+y=-3$. Now we compare this with the first equation, and note that $5x+y=-3$ in the second equation is exactly the same as $y=-3-5x$ in the first equation. Now we substitute this in to the first equation. $(2ax+2y=b) => (2ax+2(-3-5x)=b) => (2ax-6-10x=b) => (2ax-10x=-6+b) => (2a-10)x=-6+b$. Equal denominators are a friend, so we can multiply this whole thing by $-1$. $(2a-10)x=6-b$. Now we set $2ax=-6-b$. From here we get\n##### Conclusion: Since $5x+y=-3$, we substitute $y=-3-5x$ into the first equation, which makes the system homogeneous and now we have infinite solutions for $(x,y)$.

If the equation was like 5ax+5y=b instead of 2ax+2y=b the answer would be different.\nMany times, no solution to the system means that you don't have any solutions in the first place. The same way, to have infinite solution, these two lines have to have at least some points in common. That's why we are presented with special question here. That means, infinite solutions, this ordered pair has to exist in both equations. You may see here x=y=z=1.618, which has been squared. The constant",
        " From the given system of equations, the coefficient of $x$ is $2a$ and the coefficient of $y$ is $2$. The coefficient of $y$ in the second equation is $1$. Hence, we can write the system as $$\\begin{bmatrix} 2a & 2 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} x\\\\ y \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} b/2\\\\ -3\\end{bmatrix}.$$ Now, the system has infinite solutions if and only if the determinant of the first matrix is zero. That is, we have $2a\\cdot 1 - 0 \\cdot 2 = 2a = 0$, or $a = 0$. Hence, the ordered pair $(a, b)$ is $(0, b).$ The solution is the set of all pairs $(0, b)$, $b\\in \\mathbb{R}$. In other words, the solutions are all points on the $y$-axis except the origin.\n#### Correct Reasoning:\nThe question asks for the ordered pair $(a, b)$ for which there is an infinite solution to the system of equations. Therefore, we should find the sufficient condition for the system to have infinite solutions. Since the system has infinite solutions if and only if the coefficient matrix has a nontrivial kernel, that is, its determinant is zero, we have to determine when the determinant of the coefficient matrix is zero. We rewrite the system in an augmented matrix form, as we did in the classical solution. Then we conclude that $2a = 0$, hence $a = 0$. Substituting back, we find that the system of equations has infinite solutions if there is an ordered pair $(a, b)$ of zeros and any real number $b$, which means the ordered pair $(a, b) = (0, b)$. Therefore, the answer is the set of all pairs $(0, b)$, $b\\in \\mathbb{R}.$\n#### Solution Details:\nNote that we are not solving for a specific ordered pair $(a, b).$ Instead, we are finding the set of all possible ordered pairs $(a, b)$ such that the system has infinite solutions. That is, we are finding $(a, b)$ where the coefficient matrix has a nontrivial kernel. The system can be written in augmented matrix form as\n$\\begin",

        " Let\u2019s start by multiplying the second equation by 2, so we can eliminate $y$.\n\\begin{align*} 2ax+2y&=b,\\\\ 10x+2y&=-6. \\end{align*}\nNow we want to subtract the second equation from the first equation. This will eliminate $y$.\n\\begin{align*} 2ax+2y&=b, \\\\ 10x+2y&=-6. \\\\ \\underline{-(10x+2y)} \\\\ 2ax&=b+6 \\end{align*}\nAs you can see, we still have a term with $x$. So we want to solve for $x$ and use that to solve for $b$.\nHere is how we do it. We use the second original equation, $5x+y=-3,$ and solve for $y.$\n\\begin{align*} 5x+y&=-3\\\\ -y&=-3-5x\\\\ y&=5x-3 \\end{align*}\nNow substitute this expression for $y$ in $2ax+2y=b$ and solve for $x$. We will need it in order to obtain a condition on $a$ and $b$.\n\\begin{align*} 2ax+2(5x-3)&=b\\\\ 2ax+10x-6&=b\\\\ 12x+b-6&=0\\\\ 12x&=6-b\\\\ x&=\\frac{6-b}{12} \\end{align*}\nFinally, substitute this expression for $x$ in $2ax+2y=b$ and solve for $b$. We will obtain a condition on $a$ and $b$.\n\\begin{align*} 2a\\left(\\frac{6-b}{12}\\right)+2(5x-3)&=b\\\\ \\frac{12a}{12}-(b/2)+10x-6&=b\\\\ \\frac{12a}{12}+\\left(\\frac{6-b}{12}\\right)(5)-6&=b\\\\ \\frac{12a+6-b}{12}&=b\\\\ \\frac{12a-11b}{12}&=0\\\\ 12a-11b&=0\\\\ 11b&=12a\\\\ \\frac{11b}{11}&=\\frac{12a}{11}\\\\ b&",
        " In order for there to be an infinite number of solutions, the system of equations must be consistent. This means that if the equation $2ax+2y=b$ is multiplied by $5$ and subtracted from the equation $5x+y=-3$, we obtain $0=0$, the trivial equation.  This yields $$0=5(2ax+2y)-2(5x+y)\\Rightarrow 0=10ax+10y-10x-6y=-4ax-6y\\Rightarrow 0=ax+\\frac{3}{2}y.$$ We need $a$ and $\\frac{3}{2}$ to be linearly independent, meaning they cannot be proportional to each other.  For example, if $a=0$, then every $x,y$ will solve the system, which clearly does not work since we want an ordered pair $(a,b)$ for which there exist solutions.  We must have $a\\neq0$ and $\\frac{3}{2}\\neq ka$ for any constant $k$.  Hence, we must choose $a\\neq 0$ and $a\\neq\\frac{2}{3}$, otherwise we would have a contradiction.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $(a,b)=(1,\\frac{2}{3})$ will satisfy the condition.
