        " \nLet's start with $x^2 + 18x - 9 = 0$. We want to complete the square to get $$(x + b)^2 = c$$. The first step is to move the constant term to the right side. This gives $$x^2 + 18x = 9.$$ The next step is to divide both sides by 2. This gives $$\\frac{x^2+18x}{2} = \\frac{9}{2}.$$ The next step is to find a perfect square that we can use to do the completion of the square. In this case, let\u2019s use $$(x + \\frac{18}{2})^2 = (\\frac{x+18}{2})^2.$$ This gives us $$\\frac{x^2+18x+36}{4} = \\frac{9}{2}.$$ The next step is to simplify both sides. This gives $$x^2 + 18x + 36 = 18.$$ Finally, subtract 18 from both sides to get the final answer: $$c = 36 - 18 = \\boxed{18}$$. I hope this helps!\nThere are more steps involved in the completing the square procedure. Let me know if you are interested in a step-by-step explanation.

        " To complete the square we can rewrite the equation as follows:\n$$x^2+18x-9=x^2+18x+81-90=-9+81=72.$$\nNow notice that the quadratic equation has the form: $$(x + b)^2 = c.$$where $b$ is the constant term of the quadratic equation and $c$ is the constant that\u2019s added to the equation. However, Janaina\u2019s equation is not quite like this. Her equation does not have the correct number of three terms. Notice that Janaina has moved the $81$ inside the square, and removed the $-9$ outside the square. So in Janaina\u2019s equation, $c$ is the new constant value of the third term, and $b$ is the new constant together with $x$. So Janaina\u2019s $c$ will be $72$. Therefore, the value of $c$ is equal to $\\boxed{72}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 72. I hope it is correct. Please let me know if you have any questions or need any more help.",
        " \nThis equation can be rewritten as following $x^2+18x-9=(x+\\frac{18}{2})^2-\\frac{18^2}{4}-9=(x+9)^2-9-81=0$ The value of $c$ is $\\boxed{81}$.\nLet\u2019s take a look at how Janaina rewrites. Start with the equation $x^2+18x-9=0$ \nJanaina uses completing the square to get it to the form (x+b)^2=c. The first step is to move the constant to the other side of the equation, then shift all the terms to the left side of the equation. \nThe equation is now: $x^2+18x=9$ \nJanaina then takes half of the coefficient of the middle term and squares it. In this case, that would be (9/2)^2 =81/4. Then Janaina writes the equation as $(x+9/2)^2=81/4+9$. The equation is now fully in the form (x+b)^2=c. \nThen can you find the value of c? The correct answer is 81, which is my response above.  \nThe steps given above, used by Janaina, will result in a value of c of 82. In fact , Janaina make a mistake when she took half of 18 and squared it, the correct square would be $(\\frac{9}{2})^2 =\\frac{81}{4}$, so the correct equation would be $(x+\\frac{9}{2})^2 =\\frac{81}{4}+9=(x+\\frac{9}{2})^2=\\frac{81}{4}+36=81$, thus $c=81$. Janaina is wrong and the value of $c$ is $81$ not 82. I hope I was clear in my explanation and answer.  I encourage you to ask any further question. \nThank you.",
        " We know that the equation can be written in the form $(x + b)^2 = c,$ where $b$ and $c$ are integers. To achieve this, we add $9$ to both sides of the original equation to get $$x^2+18x = 9,$$and subtract $9$ from both sides of the equation to get$$x^2+18x-9=0.$$These two equations can be simplified as follows:\\begin{align*}\nx^2+18x &=9\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad (x+9)^2-81&=9\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad (x+9)^2&=90.\n\\end{align*}because $c = (x + 9)^2 = 90$.

        " \nCompleting the square, Janaina has obtained an equation of the form $(x+b)^2=c$. We can see that she will rewrite $x^2$ as $(x+b)(x+b)=x^2+2xb+b^2$, so the initial equation can be rewritten as $(x+2x+b)^2 = x^2+4x+4x^2+36x+b^2-9,c$|= $(x+2x+b)^2 = x^2+18x-9$. We can now equate coefficients and solve for $b$ and $c$: $$(x+2x+b)^2 = c$$ $$(x+2x+b)^2 = x^2+2\\cdot(x+2x+b)+b^2$$ $$x^2+2x\\cdot(2)+b^2 = x^2+4x+18x+b^2-9$$ $$2\\cdot2x = 4x+18x$$ $$b=9$$ $$c = x^2+2(9)x+(9)^2-9$$ $$c = x^2+18x+81-9$$ $$c = x^2+18x+72$$ Therefore, Janaina has obtained the equation $$(x+9)^2 = 72.$$So the value of $c$ is $\\boxed{72}$.}\nNote by Ed Ang\nTutor at Teach Tamiz\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 72.

        " We realize that\n$$x^2 + 18x - 9 = 0$$is in the form $$x^2 + 2ax + b = 0,$$so let\u2019s add 81 inside the brackets because the other way is $2a(-x).$ We have now\n$$(x + 18)^2 = c$$and $c$ is equal to $81 + 9 = 90$.",
        " First, let\u2019s notice that $x^2+18x-9 = 0$. This is equivalent to $x^2+18x+36=36+9$. We add $36$ to both sides and the equation will look like this now:\n$$(x^2+18x+36)=45$$This is the problem we are trying to solve, in a way. Now, we need to rewrite $x^2+18x+36$ in square form. In other words, we need to factor $x^2+18x+36$ into the factored form of $(x+a)^2$. If we want $x^2+18x+36$ to be in the form $(x+a)^2=b$, then we must have that $ax+a^2=b$. Since we know that $ax+a^2=x^2+18x+36$, then we can just set them equal to each other and solve for $a$:\n\\begin{align*}\nax+a^2&=x^2+18x+36\\\\\n&\\Rightarrow\\quad ax+a^2-x^2-18x-36=0\\\\\n&\\Rightarrow\\quad a(x-9) -x -36=0\\\\\n&\\Rightarrow\\quad a(x-9)=x+36\n\\end{align*}This equation has solution $x-9=\\frac{x+36}{a}=\\frac{x}{a}+\\frac{36}{a}$, or $a(x-9)=x+36$. To solve for $a$, we just divide both sides of this equation by $(x-9)$ and move everything to one side:\n\\begin{align*}\na&=\\frac{x+36}{x-9}\\\\\n&=\\frac{x-9+45}{x-9}\\\\\n&=1+\\frac{45}{x-9}\\\\\n&=1+\\frac{45}{9(1-\\frac{9}{x})}\\\\\n&=1+\\frac{5}{1-\\frac{9}{x}}\\\\\n&=1+\\frac{5}{1-\\frac{9}{x}}\\cdot\\frac{\\frac{x}{x}}{\\frac{x}{x}}\\\\\n&=1+\\frac{5}{\\frac{x}{x}-9}\\\\\n&=1+\\frac{\\frac{5}{1}}{1-\\frac{9}{x}}\\\\\n&=",
        " We first write the equation as $$x^2+18x-9=0,$$then distribute $-9$ on the LHS:\n\\begin{align*} x^2+18x-9&=0\\\\\nx^2+18x+81-81-9&=0\\\\\n(x+9)^2-81&=0.\\end{align*}Now we complete the square and get rid of the intermediate term:$$\\boxed{(x+9)^2=81}.$$ Therefore, the final answer is 81.

        " The left-hand side of the equation $x^2+18x-9$ can be factored: $$x^2+18x-9=(x+9)^2-9-9$$ $=(x+9)^2-18$.Comparing this with $(x+b)^2=c$, we see that $b=-9$ and $c=18$.

        " First of all, we expand the expression $(x + b)^2$ as follows:$$x^2+2bx+b^2$$Now, equate that expression with $x^2+18x-9$, and we will have a system: $$\\begin{cases}x^2+2bx+b^2=x^2+18x-9\\\\2b=18\\\\b^2=-9\\end{cases}$$The second equation is easy to solve and gives $b=9$.  In the process, we realize that squaring the binomial always gives an x-squared term in the expansion, so squaring the expression gives a similar quadratic term on the left hand side. The second equation readily gives us $b = 9$.  The rest of the problem now boils down to adding $b^2$ to both sides then taking the square root of both sides which results in creating a binomial with the same value of b.Note that $\\sqrt{c}$ equals however and lets write just c from now on. Now it should be the following way to continue:$$x^2+18x-9=x^2+2\\cdot9x+(9)^2-c$$Given that regardless of how we may want it decides, the whole idea is to discover the middle value 9. In visual context this tells us that when we make a triangle, the middle area we must have information of is by itself solved to create, then subtracted which would require square root. Thus, our confusion cleared now at this step it properly dives into simplification of creating a square. Break everything, we should have the following way:$$x^2+18x-9=x^2+2\\cdot9x+(9)^2-c$$Just let\u2019s rewrite the above idea with words to the summary: we spread 9 out and then we get the following:$$x^2+2\\cdot9x+(9)^2-c=x^2+18x\\$$\n$$(x+9)^2 = 9+ c$$1334141654 \u2013 c Now let\u2019s bring the values as their equivalence: $$x^2+18x-9 = (x+9)^2-c$$Then we simplify with the following method: $$\\begin{cases}(x+9)^2=c+9\\\\(x+9)^2=9+c\\end{cases}$$Finally, we get \\boxed{81} as the Figuring out",
