Final Answer: The final answer is x = \\frac{1}{3}. I hope it is correct. Alright, let\u2019s solve it step by step. The equation is: $$\\frac{1}{3x-1}=\\frac{2}{x+1}$$ First, we find a common denominator which is $(3x-1)(x+1)$.  Then, we can cross multiply the equation: $$1*(x+1) = 2*(3x-1)$$ That simplifies to: $$x+1 = 6x-2$$ We subtract $x$ on both sides to get $$1+1 = 5x-2$$ which leaves us with $$2 = 5x-2$$ We add $2$ on both sides to get $$4 = 5x$$ Finally, we divide by $5$ to get $$\\boxed{x = \\frac{4}{5}}$$ Regards, Anton. Final Answer: The final answer is x = \\frac{4}{5}. I hope it is correct. Final Answer: The final answer is x=\\frac{1}{",
        " \nGiven $\\frac{1}{3x-1} = \\frac{2}{x+1}$\nWe have to find $x$. Let\u2019s first cross multiply. $\\Rightarrow (x+1)(3x-1) = (3x-1)(2)$\nWe simplify the equation. $\\Rightarrow 3x^2-x+2x-2 = 6x-2$\nWe combine like terms. $\\Rightarrow 3x^2-x+2x-2-6x+2=0$\nWe then simplify. $\\Rightarrow 3x^2-7x=0$\nWe split the middle term by the first term. $\\Rightarrow 3x(x-7/3)=0$\nWe know that the product of two terms is 0 when one or both of the terms are 0. Therefore $3x=0$ or $x-7/3=0$\nWe solve for $x$ in both cases. In the first case, $3x=0$ implies $x=0$.\nIn the second case, $x-7/3=0$ implies $x=7/3$.\nTherefore, $x$ can be either $0$ or $\\boxed{\\frac{7}{3}}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\frac{7}{3}.

The discriminant of this quadratic is $$b^2-4ac=1^2-4(3)(-3)=1+36=37>0,$$so there are two roots.
