        " $b = -12$ Solution Explanation\nSolution 1: From the equation $x^2+bx-36=0$, it is given that $x^2+bx-36=0$ has $x = -4$ as a solution. To write this as a function equation, we can define $f(x)=x^2+bx-36$. If $-4$ is a solution to the function, we can substitute $x = -4$ into the function to get $f(-4) = 0$, which implies $f(-4)=(-4)^2+b(-4)-36=16-4b-36=0$. If we now solve for $b$, we have\n\\begin{align*}\n16-4b-36&=0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\quad -4b&=20\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad \\qquad b&=\\boxed{-12}.\n\\end{align*} \\lt/stp>\nSolution 2: It is given that $x^2+bx-36=0$, so we should complete the square. Completing the square in the expression above, we obtain $(x+3)^2+12-36=0$, so the equation becomes $(x+3)^2-24=0$. The left side factors as $(x+6)(x-2) = 0$, which gives us $x = -3$ or $x=2$. Since the problem states $x=-4$ is a solution, it must be referring to $x=-4$. This implies that $x+3=-(4+3)=-7$, which implies that $b=\\boxed{-12}$. \\lt/stp>\nSolution 3: If $-4$ is a solution to $x^2+bx-36=0$, then we can substitute $x=-4$ into the equation to get $(-4)^2+b(-4)-36=0$.

I hope it is correct.  ### Thinking algebraically:\nWe have $x^2 + bx - 36 = 0.$ The given information tells us that $x = -4$ is a solution, which implies that $(-4)^2 + b(-4) - 36 = 0$ by definition of a solution.\nNow, we simplify the equation$16 - 4b - 36 = 0$:This simplifies to $-20 = 4b$ because we just added $+36$ on both sides, and subtracted $16$ from both sides.\nMultiplying both sides by $\\frac12$, we get$-10 = 2b$which is the same thing as$-5 = b\\$. We write the answer in the desired form, using the flag Operation, as $\\boxed{-5}$. We see the big change of $2b$ happening because a division changed the sign on the original constant term. Another big fact here is the step we did before the step we evaluated equation. In this case, letting $x = -4$ and solving is an even more obvious way of showing that our original equation $\\equiv$ the new one with$16 - 4b - 36 = 0$. Why isn't it hard to solve and its solution? It's quite easy as all you need to follow would be is why it\u2019s an implied, if$\\ x = -4$ by definition of a solution. It means you would get the same equation. We assumed to push it pre :-) Back paar, I explain$16 - 4b - 36 = 0$. We get $-20 = 4b$ and $-10 = 2b$ and $-5 = b$. Like you mean how did I change code here given that you change$4b$to$2b$?  Additionally, you could have made a change to how I write the second equation. I found it a bit to$-10 = 2b$and not",

        " We know that in the general quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c$, the value $-d/a$ is a zero, where $d$ is the constant term. In the given case, $-4$ is the zero, and hence we can substitute $-4$ in place of $x$ in the quadratic equation. Now our equation becomes $16 -4b -36 = 0$.\n### Step 1: Combine like terms.\n#### Original equation\n$16 -4b -36$ = 0\n#### Simplified equation\n$-4b-20$ = 0\n#### Combine like terms\n-4b - 20 = 0\n### We have to isolate 'b' on one side. To do so, add 20 to both sides, because this is the inverse operation of subtracting.\n#### Simplified equation\n-4b - 20 + 20 = 0 + 20\n### Simplify the right hand side too.\n#### Simplified equation\n-4b = 20\n### Divide by -4 to get $b$ on one side.\n#### Simplified equation\n(b / 4) = (20 / 4)\n### Simplify further\n#### Simplified equation\nb/4 = 5\n#### Multiply both sides by 4\n#### Simplified equation\nb = 20\n### Therefore, the value of $b$ is $20$.\n#### Final Answer\nThe final answer is $20$.
