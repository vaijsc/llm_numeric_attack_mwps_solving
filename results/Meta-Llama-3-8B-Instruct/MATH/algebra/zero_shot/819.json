        "732\n#### Why it's wrong: It looks like @732's response is correct. However, I think it might not be right. \n#### Why it's wrong: In that case, the midpoint is not the correct answer, so I will have to degrade my answer choice.\n#### Acknowledgement: The answer is -8. Why? it's not clear. \n#### How to form it:\nMaple is not available at this time, but if it were available, I would be able to formulaically derive that the x-componant of the second endpoint is 5 and the y-component is -8. This is done using the fact that the midpoint of any line segment with two endpoints (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) is $\\left(\\frac{x1+x2}{2}, \\frac{y1+y2}{2}\\right)$. So plugging in 3 for both the x and y components in the midpoint formuala above, we have $\\left(\\frac{1+x2}{2}, \\frac{6+y2}{2}\\right) = (3,-2)$. This is a system of two equations. In this example, we will choose to solve for y first. Let\u2019s write this system into a system of equations by using the above given information.\n$$\n\\frac{1+x2}{2} = 3 \\\\\n\\frac{6+y2}{2} = -2\n$$\nWe can move everything to the left hand side. So it\u2019s 1+x2 =6 and 6+y2 = -4. Subtract 1 from the first equation to get x2 =5 and subtract 6 from the second equation to get y2 = -10. We have x2 = 5 and y2 = -10, so 5,-8 could be the other endpoint.\n#### Why it's wrong: When we set up the system of equations, we had to assume that the point 5,-8 is the other endpoint. So there could be a problem there.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is (5,-8). I hope it is correct. ",
        "  I encourage you to show the work here. We are told that the midpoint of a line segment is located at $(3, -2)$. We also know that the line segment has endpoints $(1,6)$ and $(x,y)$.  Thus, we have the following for the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of the midpoint:  \\begin{align*}\n&\\frac{1+x}{2}=3\\Rightarrow x=5,\\\\\n&\\frac{6+y}{2}=-2\\Rightarrow y=-14.\n\\end{align*}\nThe other endpoint of the line segment is therefore \\boxed{(5,-14)}.I am glad you are here! I encourage you to show the work here. The approach is as follows. We are told that the midpoint of a line segment is located at (3,-2).  So, if we define one of the endpoints as (1, 6) and the other endpoint as (x, y), then by using the formulae for the midpoint of two points, we have \\begin{align*} \\frac{1+x}{2}&=3,\\\\ \\frac{6+y}{2}&=-2.\\end{align*} Solving for x and y, we get $x=5$ and $y=-14$ and hence, the other endpoint is $\\boxed{(5,-14)}$.\n### END\nFinal Answer: The final answer is (5, -14).

The midpoint of two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is $\\left(\\frac{x1 + x2}{2}, \\frac{y1 + y2}{2} \\right).$\n#### For the Given Problem\nGiven: The midpoint of a line segment is at (3, -2). Here, Midpoint = (3, -2) where x2 = 3 and y2 = -2. Let (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) be the two points on the line segment. x1 = 1 and y1 = 6.\n#### Equations for the Midpoint\nUsing the equation of the midpoint, we have: \n$\\frac{x1 + x2}{2} = \\frac{1 + 3}{2}$ \n$\\frac{y1 + y2}{2} = \\frac{6 + (-2)}{2}$\n#### Simplifying the Equations\n1. $\\frac{4}{2} = 2$\n2. $\\frac{4}{2} = 2$ \n#### Solving for x1 and y1\nAfter simplifying the equations, we have x1 = 1 and y1 = 6.

If we solve $1 + x_2 = 6$ we get $x_2 = 5$.\nNext we do the same thing with the y-coordinates. $\\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} = -2$.
