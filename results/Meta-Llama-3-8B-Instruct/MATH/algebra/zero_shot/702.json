Therefore, their sum is \\begin{align*}\n5+10+15+20+\\cdots+195+200.\n\\end{align*}Notice that the difference between consecutive terms is 5. Therefore, the above sum is equal to\n\\begin{align*}\n5\\left(1+2+3+\\cdots+39+40\\right).\n\\end{align*}The formula for the sum of consecutive positive integers is $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$, so our sum becomes\n\\begin{align*}\n5\\cdot \\frac{40\\cdot 41}{2} = 820.\n\\end{align*}Now, let\u2019s find the sum of the first 20 positive, even integers. Their sum is \\begin{align*}\n2+4+6+\\cdots+38+40\n\\end{align*}The difference between consecutive terms is 2. Therefore, the above sum is equal to\n\\begin{align*}\n2\\left(1+2+3+\\cdots+19+20\\right).\n\\end{align*}Now that we have the sum formula for consecutive positive integers, the above sum becomes\n\\begin{align*}\n2\\cdot\\frac{20\\cdot 21}{2} = 220.\n\\end{align*}Finally, the positive difference between the sum of the first 20 positive multiples of 5 and the sum of the first 20 positive, even integers is\n\\begin{align*}\n820-220 = \\boxed{600}.\n\\end{align*}The above answer is the positive difference between the sum of the first 20 positive multiples of 5 and the sum of the first 20 positive, even integers. It requires careful calculation to find this exact answer.\nAlternatively, if you follow the sequence 5, 10, 15, 20, you can skip the formula for consecutive positive integers and use brute force method:\n5 + 10 = 15\n15 + 15 = 30\n30 + 20 = 50\n50 + 25 = 75\n75 + 30 = 105\n105 + 35 = 140\n140 + 40 = 180\n",
        " We know that the sum of the first $n$ positive multiples of 5 is $\\\\frac{n}{2} \\cdot (5 + 5n)$. So, the sum of the first 20 positive multiples of 5 can be written as $\\\\frac{20}{2} \\cdot (5 + 5 \\cdot 20) = 10 \\cdot (5 + 100) = 600$. \nOn the other hand, the sum of the first $n$ positive, even integers is $n(n + 1)$. So, the sum of the first 20 positive, even integers can be written as $20 \\cdot (20 + 1) = 400$. \nSo, the positive difference between these two sums is $600 - 400 = 200.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 200.

The sum of the odd integers is 1 + 3 + 5 + \u2026 + 19. In terms of the sum of the entire integers, it becomes:\nThe sum of the odd integers = (1 + 2 + 3 + \u2026 + 20) - (2 + 4 + 6 + \u2026 + 20) = 210 - 2(1 + 2 + 3 + \u2026 + 10) = 210 - 2 * 10 * (1 + 2 + \u2026 + 10 / 10) = 210 - 2 * 10 * (110/10) = 210 - 2 * 110 = 210 - 220 = -10.\nHence the sum of the first 20 positive, even integers becomes 210 - 10 = 200.\n### To find the positive difference between the sum of the first 20 positive multiples of 5 and the sum of the first 20 positive, even integers, we subtract one from another:\nThe positive difference = the sum of the first 20 positive multiples of 5 - the sum of the first 20 positive, even integers\n= 4 * 5 * (1 + 2 + 3 + \u2026 + 14) - 200\n= 4 * 5 * (14 * 15 / 2) - 200\n= 4 * 5 * 7 * 15 - 200\n= 2100 - 200\n= 1900\n### The positive difference between the sum of the first 20",

        " The sum of the first 20 positive multiples of 5 can be written as 5(1+2+3+\u2026+20). You know how to compute this sum by noting that it is the sum of the first 40 terms, minus the sum of the first 20 terms. Then the sum of the first 20 positive, even integers can be written as 2(2+4+6+\u2026+40). You can also compute this sum using the same trick. Then, the difference between these two sums will be 5(1+2+3+\u2026+20) - 2(2+4+6+\u2026+40).\n(1)\n### Given\nthe first 20 positive, even integers: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40\nthe sum of the first 20 positive multiples of 5: ?\n(2)\nLet's be clever\nwe use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: \n$$s = \\frac{n(a1 + an)}{2}$$ where $$a1$$ is the first term and $$an$$ is the last term\nLet's calculate the sum.\n### $$5(1+2+3+\u2026+20)$$\n$$a1 = 5$$\n$$an = 5(20) = 100$$\n$$n = 20$$\n(5)\nNow we substitute the values\n$$s = \\frac{20(5 + 100)}{2} = \\frac{20(105)}{2} = 1050$$\n### GOT IT",
