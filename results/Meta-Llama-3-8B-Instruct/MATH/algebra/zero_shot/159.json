        " $f (10)-f (9) = (10)^2 + 10 + 17-(9)^2 - 9 - 17 = 1$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 1. I hope it is correct.  I check for the f(10) and f(9) $f(10)=101+10+17=128$ and $f(9)=81+9+17=107$ Using this values $f(10)-f(9)=128-107=21$ But answer is also saying that f(10)-f(9)=1. So this is saying that my method is wrong. I am not able to understand how it is 1. Can you please explain it. We are trying to find the difference between $f(10)$ and $f(9)$.  Let\u2019s determine $f(10)$ first.  We have $$f(10) = 10^2 + 10 + 17 = 100 + 10 + 17 = 127.$$ Now, let\u2019s determine $f(9)$: $$f(9) = 9^2 + 9 + 17 = 81 + 9 + 17 = 107.$$ Since we are trying to find the difference between these two values, we simply subtract $f(9)$ from $f(10)$: \\begin{align*}\nf(10) - f(9) & = 127 - 107\\\\\n& = \\boxed{20}.\n\\end{align*}We can see that the proposed solution is indeed incorrect. It is saying $f(10)-f(9)=1$ instead of $20$. Therefore, it is wrong.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 20. I hope it is correct. I'm with you. It seems that the answer $\\boxed{1}$ given by the problem statement is incorrect. An off-by-one error? Competitors, I implore you, double-check your work!  I am going to dispute this answer publicly. The presented question says the sequence is $f(n) = n^2 + n + 17$ for $0 \\leq n \\leq 15$. If this sequence generates prime numbers, then the claim is that the output numbers are prime numbers for $n$ in this given range. My understanding is that 81, 100, 121 etc. are not prime numbers.

So, there is no doubt that if, for example, we call it.\nOnce we have the value of $f(n+3)$ there is no doubt that if we compare $f(n)$ and $f(n+3)$ we find that $f(n+3)-f(n)$ will always be prime. Therefore, we have the final answer as $64-17=\\boxed{47}$.usb17 Gong thanks Best regards, thanks  for the response retrieved.rob.4  I hope I can help to clarify the question. To answer the question, we look at the first few values of $f(n)$ to see which of them are prime:\n$$f(0) = 17, f(1) = 18, f(2) = 23, f(3) = 34, f(4) = 37, f(5) = 42, f(6) = 47, f(7) = 56, f(8) = 64$$ We see that $f(2) = 23$ and $f(6) = 47$ are prime.
