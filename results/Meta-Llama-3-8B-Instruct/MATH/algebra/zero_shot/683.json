To calculate the required interest rate, let\u2019s first calculate the amount of the deposits.  The first deposit is$\\$20{,}000$. The second deposit after $1$ year will be $1.0+1.0r$ times $20{,}000$, since $1.0+1.0r$ will be the value factor after $1$ year. Finally, the third deposit after $2$ years will be $$(1.0+1.0r)^2\\cdot 20{,}000.$$Total, the deposits equal$20{,}000+20{,}000(1.0+1.0r)+20{,}000(1.0+1.0r)^2=40{,}000+40{,}000r+40{,}000r^2$; this is the total deposited into the account. Now, since the worker wants$66{,}200$at the end of $3$ years, the amount in the account at the end of$3$years will be the total deposited less the gained interest$66{,}200-40{,}000-40{,}000r-40{,}000r^2$.$Equating this to$66{,}200$shows $40{,}000r^2+40{,}000r+4400=26000$.\n### Step 2:\nWe can factor the quadratic polynomial left-hand side of the equation.

The term$40000\\times x^2$becomes important when$x$is large, so$\\$80x + 40000\\times x^2\\geq 0$ becomes $\\$80x\\geq 0$, which is also always true. Thus,$80000\\times x^2$can be positive, which means$40000\\times x^2$should be smaller in absolute value than$80x$.

        " To answer this question we make use of the concept of compound interest. The interest can be calculated at the end of each year and we only care about the total amount in the account after the interest is paid at the end of the third year. Let the interest rate be r each year. The account will have a balance $20000\\cdot (1+r)$ after the first year. After the second year the balance will be $20000\\cdot (1+r)^2$. After the third year, the balance will be $20000\\cdot (1+r)^3$. If we set $20000\\cdot (1+r)^3 = 66200$, we need to solve for r. $r$ is the rate of interest. First, we factor out 20000, and we have: \\begin{align*}20000&=\\frac{66200}{(1+r)^3}\\\\ \\Rightarrow \\qquad20000(1+r)^3&=66200\\qquad (1)\\end{align*}If we square both sides, we get: \\begin{align*}\\left[20000(1+r)^3\\right]^2&=\\left(66200\\right)^2\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad 4000000000&=4396400000\\left(1+r\\right)^6\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad 4000000000\\left(1-r\\right)^6&=4396400000\\\\ \\Rightarrow \\qquad(1-r)^6&=\\frac{4000000000}{4396400000}\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad1-r&=0.090245\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad r&=0.909755\\\\ \\end{align*}Given 0.909755, you can round to 0.91, just keep in mind it is still 0.909755.\n### Explanation: The key here is to formulate the equation for the amount of money that will be in the account after each year, and then solve for the interest rate. If we set $20000\\cdot (1+r)^3 = 66200$, we need to solve for r. Then we can solve for \\boxed{\\boxed{\\boxed{9.07}}}. we factor out 20000 first. The first line is just setting it up.

Let\u2019s break it down step by step by thinking about how to calculate the total funds in the account at the end of three years.\n\\begin{align*} The number of dollars he puts in at the end of each year is$20,000. Let $x$ be the number of dollars in the account at the beginning of the second year. Then at the end of the second year, he will have $20,000+x$ dollars. At the end of the third year, he will have $\\$20,000+\\left(\\$20,000+x\\right)$, or$\\$40,000+x$, which must be at least $\\$66,200$. Subtracting$\\$40,000$ from both sides gives$x\\geq\\26,200$.This means that if there were no interest or withdrawals, the minimum amount he could have at the beginning of the second year would be$\\$26,200$. Then the minimum amount he could have deposited in the first year would be $\\$6,200$. Now, at the end of the first year, he would have $6,200$ dollars. In the beginning of the second year, he would have $(1+r)$ times this amount, where $r$ is the rate of interest, compounded annually. In other words, the minimum amount he would need at the beginning of the second year would be $$(1+r)(\\$6,200) = \\$26,200.$$ Solving for $r$, we have $$1+r = \\frac{\\26,200}{\\$6,200}\\Rightarrow r = \\frac{\\26,200}{\\$6,200}-1 = \\boxed{0.025}.$$ We multiply this answer by 100 to change it to a percentage. We get 2.5\\%, or \\boxed{7\\%} after dropping the decimal point.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 7\\%. I hope it is correct. ### Explanation: The fact that we need to make the savings grow from $\\$6,200$to$\\$26,200$ after two years implies that there must be at least a 4,000 dollar increase. This can only occur if there is a 7% return. This makes intuitive sense since if the amount doubles in one year, it will quadruple in two years, which covers exactly the 3,800 dollar difference",

Simplifying, we can isolate $r$: \\begin{align*} 20{,}000 \\times (1 + \\frac{r}{100})^2 + 20{,}000 &= 66{,}200 \\\\ 20{,}000 + 20{,}000 \\times \\frac{r}{100} + 20{,}000 \\times \\frac{r^2}{4000} &= 66{,}200 \\\\ 0 &= 20{,}000 \\times \\frac{r^2}{4000} + 6600 - 20{,}000 \\times \\frac{r}{100} \\\\ 0 &= r^2 - 0.2 r + 0.0067 \\\\ 0 &= (r - 0.02213) (r - 0.283) \\end{align*}The smaller value is the one that works, since it can only represent a simple interest rate, so $r=\\boxed{2.213 \\%}$.

        " A worker receives an annual wage of$\\$20{,}000$, which he always deposits into a savings account at the end of the year. By the end of the third year (when he makes the third deposit), he wants to have at least $\\$66,200$ in the account to finance the purchase of a house. What is the minimal compound interest rate that the savings account must provide? Express your answer as a percentage, but do not include the percent sign. First, we can find out how much he will deposit in total into his account after 3 years. In the first year, he deposits$20{,}000$into the account. In the second year, he also deposits$20{,}000$into the account, for a total deposit of$40{,}000$after 2 years. In the third year, he will also deposit$20{,}000$into the account, for a total deposit of$60{,}000$. Therefore, he will have $60{,}000$ in the account at the end of the third year. Because the account must have at least$\\$66{,}200$ at the end of the third year, the interest he receives must be at least $66{,}200-60{,}000=\\$6{,}200$ to add to the total of$60{,}000$. The amount received from interest grows at a rate described with the formula for compound interest, $A_p=(1+r)^nA_i$. We can calculate that $A_p=A_i(1+\\frac{r}{n})^n$. Let the rate be described by$r$, where$r$is in decimal form, so the percentage is$r\\cdot 100$. The interest would be$6,200$for three years, which would be $(1+\\frac{r}{3})^3 * 60000 - 60000$by the formula. This could be written as $60000((1+\\frac{r}{3})^3-1)$. The interest growth would have to be $6{,}200$, so this equation would have to be$6{,}200$. Setting these equal to each other, we get: $$60000((1+\\frac{r}{3})^3-1)=6{,}200$$ $$\\frac{6{,}200}{60000}=(1+\\frac{r}{3})^",
        "  After the first year, he will have$\\$20{,}000$ in the account.\nAfter the second year, he will have $20{,}000\\cdot 1+\\frac{20{,}000r}{100}$ in the account.\nAfter the third year, he will have $20{,}000\\cdot(1+\\frac{r}{100})^2+\\frac{20{,}000r}{100}$ in the account.\nBy the end of the third year, this should be at least $\\$66{,}200$, so we want to solve \\begin{align*}20{,}000\\cdot(1+\\frac{r}{100})^2+\\frac{20{,}000r}{100}&\\ge 66200\\\\\n\\Rightarrow 40000+40000r+40000r^2&\\ge 66200.\\end{align*}The interest rate will be $r$ (as a decimal). To make this an equal sign, we can first divide both sides by $40000$, and then take a square root, and then subtract the interest rate. The equation then becomes \\begin{align*}\n1+r+r^2&\\ge 16.55\\\\\n\\Rightarrow 2(1+\\sqrt{r}+r)&\\ge 16.55\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\sqrt{r}&\\ge 0.9576\\\\\n\\Rightarrow r&\\ge 0.9210^2\\approx 0.846\\approx\\boxed{84.6}.\n\\end{align*} Final Answer: The final answer is 84.6.

For this problem, we just need to compute the value of $r$. First, we set up the equation \\begin{align*} A_{1} &= 20000, \\\\ A_{2} &= A_{1} (1 + r) + 20000, \\\\ A_{3} &= A_{2} (1 + r) + 20000. \\end{align*} Then we can substitute the first two equations into the last to get \\begin{align*} 66200 &= (20000 (1 + r) + 20000) (1 + r) + 20000 \\\\ 66200 &= 20000 (1 + r)^{2} + 20000 (1 + r) + 20000 \\\\ 0 &= 20000 (1 + r)^{2} + 20000 (1 + r) - 66200. \\end{align*} We can simplify the equation by dividing by $20000$: \\begin{align*} 0 &= (1 + r)^{2} + (1 + r) - 3.31 \\\\ 0 &= (1 + r)^{2} + 1 + r - r - 3.31 \\\\ 0 &= (1 + r)^{2} - (1 + r + 3",

Any rate less than the minimal rate will result in the account being less than 66,200 at the end of three years. Let $r$ be the interest rate. Then the interest of the account at the end of the third year is $66{,}200-20{,}000=46{,}200`.
