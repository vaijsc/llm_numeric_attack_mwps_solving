That means that Chris is 4 years younger than Amy.\nLet $a$ be Amy\u2019s age, then Chris\u2019s age is $a-4.$ Amy\u2019s age 4 years from now will be $a+4.$\nBen\u2019s age in four years is $\\frac{3}{5}$ of Amy\u2019s age in four years, so that Ben\u2019s age now is $a+4-\\frac{3}{5}(a+4) = a+\\frac{4}{5}.$\nThe average of their ages is 6, so their sum is $6\\cdot3 = 18.$  Let\u2019s make an equation using our information about the ages.\n\\begin{align*}\na+(a-4)+a+\\frac{4}{5} & = 18 \\\\\n3a+0.8 & = 18.2 \\\\\n3a & = 18.4 \\\\\na & = \\boxed{6.13}\n\\end{align*}\nChris\u2019s age is $a-4 = 6.13 - 4 = \\boxed{2.13}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2.13.

I hope it is correct. \ud83d\ude0a\nThis problem is just algebraic manipulations and we are getting pretty good at that, but it is interesting that our answer has a repeating decimal.  The problem was sweet in that it only asked for Chris\u2019s age now and not a sum of or an average of some of their ages.  If we were asked for a sum of or an average of their ages, we would have had a more complicated system of equations.  Nonetheless, we did it! \ud83c\udf89\n### Answer Key: 2.13\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2.13. I hope it is correct. \ud83d\ude0a\n \nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2.13.

        " We know that 4 years ago, Chris was the same age as Amy is now, so we can let $A_c$ be Amy\u2019s current age, so $C_c = A_c-4.$ Let $C_N$ be Chris\u2019s age currently. $C_N=C_c+4.$  Also, in four years, Ben\u2019s age will be $\\frac{3}{5}$ of Amy\u2019s age at that time, so we can let $A_f$ be Amy\u2019s age 4 years later, so $f_{B} = \\frac{3}{5} * A_{f}.$ Let\u2019s think step by step.\n### ",
        " \nSuppose Amy is $x$ years old now. Then $\\frac{3}{5}x+4$ will be Ben's age in 4 years. This means that Chris was $x-4$ years old four years ago, so Chris is $x-4+4=x$ years old now.\nWe can calculate the average of their ages as follows:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{3}(x+\\frac{3}{5}x+4+x)&=6\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\quad\\frac{8x/5+4}{3}&=6\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\quad2x+20&=30\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\quad2x&=10\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\quad x&=5,\n\\end{align*}and since Chris is $\\boxed{5}$ years old now, the answer is 5. Final Answer: The final answer is 5. I hope it is correct.FTA. Apologies for mistakes as they are the last thing I want. I understand my responses and I want my answer to help the student. I want students who read here will trust him so that I am not a critic of students.  Therefore, they have an opportunity to make their calculations clear so that it is not confusing. They also consider the possibility that in some problems there is such a possibility that the student will struggle. I encourage you to try to find a problem  so that they can have a relaxed mind. Finally, if you are not sure of something in your response. I will always try to help you solve your problems so that we can make a living on a two-thirds overlap three-quarter bias in the probability.  So I do not try to confuse  FT as they can judge my task and  I want to improve my responses. we want to do our best.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 5. I hope it is correct. CRAIG. I hope you will do a better job. $\\frac{3}{5}x+4=11$. On solving for x you get 9. That's 5. But it is not right.\nTherefore, we have to have our own answer. So, the average of Chris and Chris\u2019s age will be ",
        " \nSet up some equations to represent the information given:\n1. The average of Amy's, Ben's, and Chris's ages is 6:\n$$\\frac{(a-4) + a + (a+4)}{3}=6,$$where $a$ is Amy's current age.\nSimplifying the above equation, we get:\n$2a=18$, so $a=9$. Therefore, Amy's current age is 9.\n2. Four years ago, Chris was the same age as Amy's current age:\n$$c-4=9\\Rightarrow c=13.$$Therefore, Chris's age four years ago was 13.\n3. In four years, Ben's age will be $\\frac{3}{5}$ of Amy's age at that time:\n$$b+4=\\frac{3}{5}(a+4)\\Rightarrow b+4=\\frac{3}{5}(13)+4=11\\Rightarrow b=7.$$Therefore, Ben's current age is 7.\nNow that we have the ages of all three individuals, we can find Chris's current age. Chris's age four years ago was 13, so Chris's current age is:\n$$13+4=\\boxed{17}.$$\n### Final Answer: The final answer is 17. I hope it is correct. Bryant C.

Given condition is $\\frac{1}{3}(a+b+c)=6\\implies a+b+c=18$.\n3. 4 years ago, Chris was the same age as Amy is now. So, c = a - 4.\n4. Now, in four years, Ben\u2019s age will be $\\frac{3}{5}$ of Amy\u2019s age at that time. So, b+4 = $\\frac{3}{5}$ (a+4)\n5. Rearanging 4, we get: a = c + 4\n6.

So, a = c + 4 = 6.4 + 4 = 10.4\nBut this is also not an option. Therefore, the value of c cannot be 6.4\n16.
