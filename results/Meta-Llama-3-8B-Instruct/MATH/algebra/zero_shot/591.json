Putting this $\\boxed{x^2-y^2}$ in place of the $$(x+y)(x-y)$$ on the left, we should see what is the expression that I have. Thus the equation will be$\\boxed{x^2-y^2}=\\ldots$The right side, fill it with what I got from it. Therefore, $\\boxed{x^2-y^2}=(13)^2-5^2$, so that $\\boxed{(x+y)(x-y)}$ is equal to$\\boxed{(13)^2-5^2}$. So the final answer is$$(13)^2-5^2=144.$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 144.

You know now how to evaluate $(x+y)(x-y)$ $(x+y)(x-y)$ when $x=13, y = 5$ is $144.$\n### Check question: To verify that $(x+y)(x-y)$ correctly equals $x^2 - y^2$, select $x=5,$ and $y=2.$ $(5+2)(5-2)=7\\cdot3=21$ Now, test your result with $(5)^2 - (2)^2=25-4=21.$ The answer is correct!\n### Conclusion:  This illustrates the fact that the expression $(x+y)(x-y)$ and $x^2-y^2$ are equivalent for any choice of real numbers $x$ and $y.$  Although this exercise may seem simple, it demonstrates the effectiveness of step-by-step problem-solving and the importance of understanding the importance of order-of-operations when working with algebraic expressions.  This technique can also be applied to more complex problems.  When in doubt, practice and the association of ideas with procedures can help solidify your understanding of algebraic expressions.\nI hope this solution shows you a step-by-step guide to solving the given problem $(x+y)(x-y)$ when $",
