        " Here\u2019s the step-by-step solution.\nStep 1: We are given that $\\sqrt[3]{4x^2}=4$. Since 4 is the cube root of $4^3=64$, we can raise both sides to the power of 3 to obtain $4x^2=64$. We can divide both sides by 4 to get $x^2=16$, which simplifies to $x=\\pm4$.\nStep 2: So, the possible values of $x$ are $4$ and $-4$.

These two values satisfy the original equation, making them the only values that work. This is a simple equation where cube roots are involved.\n### Final Answer: The final answer is (-4),4. I hope it is correct.  I cannot underscore because of formatting issue.  I will find a way to address this in the future. In this particular case, since we are in a Pandoc document, underscores are used to represent emphasis. Therefore, there is no way to underscore in the answer.  However, the program \"Pandoc\" will eventually be adopted in more languages and will overcome such limitations. I suggest that it will be capable of formatting answer or at least nest a code or container block around the unsugged text. In the meantime, we will have to manually specify the numbers as **boxed**.  We can suggest ways to address this limitation.

This is good!\n    - Encourage the student to check their work by plugging their solution back into the original equation and verifying that it is true.\n    - Consider adding more depth to the problem by asking the student to explain why they chose to cube root both sides of the equation or how they know that $x^2=16$ implies that $x=\\pm4$.\n### Assessment criteria:\n    - Number Sense and Operations: The student demonstrates an understanding of cube roots and square roots.\n    - Problem Solving: The student demonstrates the ability to work through a problem step by step, making connections between the original equation and the solution.\n    - Reasoning and Proof: The student demonstrates an understanding of why the solution is correct, even though it is not explicitly stated in the solution provided.\n### Additional suggestions:\n    - For a more challenging problem, consider asking the student to solve a quadratic equation that has complex solutions. For example, $x^2+4x+4=0$.\n    - For a real-world application, consider asking the student to solve a problem involving the cost of electricity or the area of a room.

From here we can divide by 4 to get $x^2=4^2$.  Finally, taking the square root of both sides, we find that $x = \\pm 4.$  Therefore, the values of $x$ are -4 and 4, and in order from least to greatest they are $\\boxed{-4,4}$.()[\"symbolic\"])\u9060\u7a0b\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u8ab2\u7a0b\u306f\u3001\u5f53\u793e\u306e\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u5b66\u7fd2\u30d7\u30e9\u30c3\u30c8form\u4e0a\u3067\u63d0\u4f9b\u3055\u308c\u307e\u3059\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5c06\u88ab\u952e\u5165\u3001\u8bb0\u6570\u3001\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u3001.MSGnowiving\u3001IPA\u093e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u6280\u80fd\u5728\u8fdb\u884c\u53d1\u97f3\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u8bfe\u4ef6\u5411\u60a8\u5c55\u793a\u4e86Course\u5185\u5bb9\u3001\u58c1\u864e\u3001\u54f2\u5b66\u3001\u4e13\u4e1a\u7684\u9986\u957f\u5b9e\u9645\u60c5\u51b5\u4e2d\u3002 \u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u5728\u5b66\u4e60English\u4f60\u8d39\u65f6\u95f4\uff1a \n1.\u8bfe\u7a0b\u6750\u6599\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u60c5\u51b5-collection ofactual situation\u4e2d\u7684Course\u627eAg\ufffd UINavigationController\"]==.EditorButton[\"=\"<? teachings.

        " First, we cube both sides to get rid of the cube root:\n$$4x^2=(4)^3=64.$$Now we divide both sides by 4 and simplify: $$x^2=16\\Rightarrow x=\\pm\\sqrt{16}=\\pm4.$$The possible values of x are therefore -4 and 4, in both the positive and negative forms. Here are all 4 possible values: $-4$, $4$. We list them from least to greatest. That\u2019s it! We have solved the problem. If you have any mistakes or concerns, feel free to let us know.
