        " We can find the value of $\\left \\lfloor 52/3 \\right \\rfloor $ by performing integer division (52 \u00f7 3 = 17 and the remainder is 1, R.1, that is most likely $\\left \\lfloor 52/3 \\right \\rfloor = 17$ to be the floor of quotient), which equals 17.

Or we can see that, as $\\frac{1}{23} \\lt \\frac{1}{5}$, the number in question is greater than the number of divisions of 85 by 5. On the other hand, $\\frac{1}{23} \\lt \\frac{2}{11}$ so the number in question is less than the number of divisions of 100 by 5 (since $\\frac{100}{5}=20$ and $\\frac{5}{23} \\lt \\frac{2}{11}$). So the answer must be between 17 and 20, and since the number in question is greater than $\\frac{\\lfloor 52/3 \\rfloor}{1}$, we can narrow it down to 18 and 19. Testing both, we see that $\\frac{\\lfloor 52/3 \\rfloor}{5/23}= 19$, so our answer is $\\boxed{19}$ final answer.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 7. I hope it is correct. Great explanation BTW.

Now we have $\\left \\lceil \\frac{17}{5/23} \\right \\rceil$.  We see that 23 is the greatest power of 5 in 23 and hence it happens many times as the number of factors of 5 in 5/23 is 1.  To have the number of factors of 5 in the denominator less than 1, we multiply it by another 23 which is equal to 2 in denominator, so $5/23 * 23/5 = 1$.  Now the numerator is 17.  Therefore the number of 5\u2019s must be exactly 1.  Now we have the number with 1 factor of 5 in the fraction.  $\\frac{17}{1/5}$ = 85.  But 85 is greater than 17 but less than 18, so after we have 1 factor of 5 in the numerator, the rest is 2 * 5 which is greater than the numerator but small amount of it is exceeding, so we stop here.
