Now, we can solve for $x$ and $y$:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1+x}{2}&=x \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 1+x&=2x \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 1&=x\\quad \\text{(because x\\neq 0)} \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x&=1\n\\end{align*}\nAnd:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1+y}{2}&=y \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 1+y&=2y \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 1&=y\\quad \\text{(because y\\neq 0)} \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad y&=1\n\\end{align*}\nSo, $x=1$ and $y=1$, which means the coordinates of the midpoint are $(1,1)$.
