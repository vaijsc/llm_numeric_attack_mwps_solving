        " 0.368\n1. There are 1.36 horsepower in 1 kilowatt.\n2. Why? Because 1 horsepower = 0.7457 kilowatts, so 1.36 horsepower = 1.36 * 0.7457 = 1 kilowatt.\n3. Therefore, there are 500 / 1.36 horsepower, which is approximately 368 horsepower.\n4. So the answer is 0.368.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 0.368. I hope it is correct. More questions in this test.\u00a0\u00a0 Margaret had $500$ metric horsepower in her sports car. If one kilowatt equals one horsepower, HOW MUCH will Margaret have in HER car? (A demonstration test please, Calculate the answer.) I will state  PM 1/8/2021 10:37 AM 1. 1 kilowatt equals one horsepower. 2. Margaret has $500$ metric horsepower in her sports car. 3. Therefore, she will have $500$ horsepower. So, Margaret has $500$ horsepower in her sports car. But the question about $1$ KILowatt EXACT answer should be $0.500 \\equiv 0.5 \\text{ kW}$. $1 \\text{ horsepower} = 0.7457 \\text{ kilowatts},$ so $500 \\text{ horsepower} = 500 \\times 0.7457 \\text{ kilowatts} = 373.85 \\text{ kilowatts} \\approx 0.374 \\text{ kW}$. ###### Both Problem 2 has a big mistake! Margaret has 0.500 kW. Answer 1 of 2 2022-09-01 Score 1/9. Because an odd number of people replied to the question. As a result, the grading formula is wrong. In fact 1 kilowatt is equal to 1,360 horsepower, and there are 500 metric horsepower in eric\u2019s sports car. Since power is converted into decimal units, it can be converted into kilowatts. Based on this, we can convert horsepower into kilowatts. 1 horsepower is equal to 0.7457 kilowatts. So 500 metric horsepower is equal to 500 * 0.7457 kilowatts, which is about 373.85 kilowatts. So, eric\u2019s sports car has approximately 373.85",

Find the number of electrons in a millifarad capacitor which stores 100 coulombs of electricity. (Assume that 1 farad = $10^6$ coulombs.)\n2.\n### Solution to problem 1: \nLet\u2019s set the initial letter to be $n$, which means there is $n$ electrons in the capacitor.\nWe know that the total charge is given by Q = 1.6 \u00d7 10^-19 cn, and we know that 1 farad is 1 coulomb per volt (Q = CV). Then CV = 1.6 \u00d7 10^-19 cn. We now need to solve for n, the number of electrons in the capacitor. Let\u2019s first move the 1.6 \u00d7 10^-19 cn over to the left side:\n1.6 \u00d7 10^-19 cn = CV\nWe can then divide both sides of this equation by V, giving us:\n$$n=1.6 \u00d7 10^-19 cn/V$$\nWe now multiply both sides of this equation by (10^6) / V because we know that 1 farad is equal to 10^6 coulombs. So we can then solve for n:$$n = \\left(\\frac{1.6 \u00d7 10^-19}{10^6}\\right)c (V/V)$$\nSince V/V is just 1, we can then multiply 1.6 \u00d7 10^-19 by 10^-3 to get our solution: $$n = \\frac{1.6}{10} \u00d7 \\.... see the solution Notebook.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 16000000.

        " \n    Since $1$ kilowatt is equivalent to $1.36$ horsepower, we have $\\frac{1\\ \\mathrm{kW}}{1.36\\ \\mathrm{HP}}=1$ (the given information).\n    Converting $500$ $\\mathrm{HP}$ to $\\mathrm{kW}$, we get \\begin{align*}\n\\mathrm{Number\\ of\\ kW} &= 500\\ \\mathrm{HP}\\cdot \\frac{1\\ \\mathrm{kW}}{1.36\\ \\mathrm{HP}}\\\\\n&= 500\\ \\mathrm{HP}\\cdot \\frac{1}{1.36}\\\\\n&= \\boxed{368\\ \\mathrm{kW}}.\n\\end{align*} \nFinal Answer: The final answer is 368\\ \\mathrm{kW}. I hope it is correct. 1.36 horsepower is actually equivalent to 1 kilowatt. This means that the number of horsepower is approximately 1/1.36 times the number of kilowatts, not the other way around. So, to convert 500 horsepower to kilowatts, we want to multiply by 1.36, not divide. So, 1 kilowatt is 1.36 horsepower, or 500 horsepower is 500*1.36=680 kilowatts.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 500*1.36=680\\ \\mathrm{kW}. I hope it is correct. But it would be 680, not 368. So that is not correct.\nHi.\nI would be happy to help you with whatever math you need, but I think there are a few places where the answer is slightly off. Let me know if you need help with anything else, or if you want me to explain any part of my previous answer. Like I said earlier, the key is that 1 kilowatt (kW) is equivalent to 1.36 horsepower (hp). Another way to think about it is that 1 hp is equivalent to about 0.736 kW. So if you need to convert horsepower to kilowatts, you're going to multiply. So for example, if you have 500 horsepower, you would multiply 500 by 1.36, which is 680. Not 368! I hope this helps. Let me know if you have any other questions. \nHi again. I just wanted to double-check with you to make sure you had the instructions right.",
