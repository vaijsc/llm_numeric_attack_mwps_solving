        " $\\frac{1}{y}+ y$\n### Explanation:\nThe big trick here is to remember that we can distribute the fraction $\\frac{1}{4}$, even though it's not a Term.  That is, $$\\frac{1}{4}\\cdot\\left(\\frac{4}{y} + 4y\\right) = \\frac{1}{4}\\cdot\\frac{4}{y} + \\frac{1}{4}\\cdot4y$$which we simplify by simplifying each of these separate terms: $$\\frac{1}{y}+ y$$\nHowever, it might have been more intuitive to distribute the product $\\frac{1}{4}$ as $(\\frac{1}{4})\\frac{4}{y} + (\\frac{1}{4})4y,$ and then cancel the common factor $4$ from the two terms.  You could do the same as in your last response, however.  Only, in that way, the rule for removing parentheses gets to work.  That's how its done in this example.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\frac{1}{y}+ y. I hope it is correct.",

        " I know how to expand products of expressions! Here, we are required to expand: $\\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\frac{4}{y} + 4y\\right)$.\nHere we have a product and on the left we have a fraction.\n### Solution: \\begin{align*} \\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\frac{4}{y} + 4y\\right) &= \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{4}{y} + \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot 4y \\\\ &= \\frac{1}{y} + y \\end{align*}\n### Explanation:\nThere are two main steps to expand such an expression: 1. Break down the expression at the parentheses: Combine the terms inside the parentheses: $\\frac{4}{y} + 4y$\n2. Multiply each parenthesis term with the part just outside it. Multiply the first term, $\\frac{4}{y}$, by the $\\frac{1}{4}$ outside it. Multiply the second term, $4y$, by the $\\frac{1}{4}$ outside it.\n### Video Work:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YXJ4JSA29s\n1.
