I hope it is correct. ### Explanation:\nWhen we see expressions with the log function and base not explicitly stated, we often need to perform logarithmic conversion. Here, we know that $\\log_4 4^x=x$, so $(4^x)^{\\log_4 4^x}=4^x$.\nWe also know that $\\log_{a} a = 1$ for any valid base $a$. Therefore, we set $\\log_{64^{\\frac{1}{3}}} 4^x = 1 \\implies 4^x = 64^{\\frac{1}{3}}$.\nSince $64 = 2^6$, we know that $4^x = (2^2)^x = 2^{2x}$, and $64^{\\frac{1}{3}} = 2^{2\\frac{1}{3}} = 2^{\\frac{2}{3}}$. Therefore, $2^{2x} = 2^{\\frac{2}{3}}$.\nFor any two valid bases $a, b$ with $a \\neq 0, 1$, we know that $\\log_{a} b = \\frac{\\log_{c} b}{\\log_{c} a}$, where $c$ is the base of the more familiar logarithm, often equal to $",
