        " 3\n#### Explanation\nHere the question requires us to find the output value of $\\log_327$.  If we think of $\\log_327$ as the exponent value for the base 7 such that $7^{\\log_327}=27$, we need a value of $\\log_327$ such that $7^{\\log_327}=27$.\nBy trial and error, we know the lowest value of is $1$ since we are asking a power equation. Therefore, it should give us $7^1=7$, and we need to check the next value of $2$. Evaluating $7^2=49$, this still doesn't match $27$. Evaluating $7^3=343$, this indeed matches $27$. Therefore, $\\log_327=3$. Final Answer: The final answer is 3. I hope it is correct.\ufeff\ufeff\nThank you for showing me your solution. The problem you are describing is a bit different than our problem. Our problem is $\\log_327$, which is equivalent to $\\frac{\\ln 27}{\\ln 7}=\\frac{\\ln 3^3}{\\ln 7}=\\frac{3\\ln 3}{\\ln 7}$. This can be evaluated using the property of logarithms $\\ln a^b = b\\ln a$, which yields$$\\frac{\\ln 3^3}{\\ln 7}=\\frac{3\\ln 3}{\\ln 7}$$ Since we are asked to find the logarithm, we know that this expression will have a value of $\\boxed{3}$ because $\\frac{3 \\ln{3}}{\\ln{7}} = 3$.\nIs there anything else I can do for you today? Thank you for the chance to work with you. I won\u2019t assume any other solution is correct because it might be. My method was a little different.\nNo worries at all! Your solution was actually great! I was trying to solve the problem by finding the base-7 logarithm of 27 directly, but your solution is much cleaner and more intuitive. Using the property of logarithms to expand logarithms into multiplications is a more natural approach.\nAnd thank you for clarifying that the problem is asking for the logarithm of 27 base 7, rather than something else. It's always good to make sure we're on the same page.\nIf you have any more problems you'd like to work on, feel",

America will prelude, to individuals $100.000 a gift of money, to increase of the translation of fights of arithmetic operations of financial urgencies.\nSolution 1: One method is to recall that the equation $\\log_{b}x^a=a\\log_{b}x$ holds for any real numbers $b>0$, $x>0$, and $a$. By taking $b=2$, $x=27$, and $a=1/3$, we can use this equation to get\n$$\\log_327=\\frac{1}{3}\\log_227=3\\Rightarrow \\boxed{3}.$$\nSolution 2: The equation $\\log_{b}x=a$ is equivalent to $b^a=x$. Therefore, $\\log_227=27^{1/3}=3$.\nSolution 3: Let $n=\\log_2 27.$ Then $2^{n} = 27$. This means that $$2^{n}=3^{3},$$which implies $n=3$. Thus, $\\log_2 27 = \\boxed{3}$. Since $\\log_2 27 = \\log_327$, we can conclude that $\\boxed{\\log_327=3}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 3. I hope it is correct.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 3. I hope it is correct.

        " $3$.\n### Why?\nWe use the base change formula: \\log_ac = \\frac{\\log_b a}{\\log_b c}.\nUsing b = 10, we have c = 10 and a = 72, so we need to find \n $$\\ln 10\\equiv \\left(\\log_{10}72\\right)/\\left(\\log_{10}3\\right)=\\frac{\\log_{10}8+\\log_{10}9}{\\log_{10}3}.$$We know that $8=2^3$, so $\\log_{10}8=3\\log_{10}2$. We also know that $9=3^2$, so $\\log_{10}9=2\\log_{10}3$. Therefore, $$\\frac{\\log_{10}8+\\log_{10}9}{\\log_{10}3}=\\frac{3\\log_{10}2+2\\log_{10}3}{\\log_{10}3}=3+\\frac{2\\log_{10}2}{\\log_{10}3}.$$Since $\\log_{10}2\\approx0.301$, the expression above is approximately equal to $$3+2\\times\\frac{0.301}{1.099}\\approx3+0.549=\\boxed{3.549},$$where the approximate result was obtained using logarithms with base 10 and arithmetic operations with real numbers. The base 10 logarithm can be found using base change with $e$ so the base change formula states that $\\log_{e}e=1$, $\\log_{e}10\\approx2.3026$ and $\\log_{e}3\\approx1.0986$, so it follows that \\log_{e}72=\\log_{e}2^{2\\log_{e}2+\\log_{e}9}=\\log_{e}2^{2\\log_{e}2+2\\log_{e}3}=\\log_{e}2^{1+2}=3$, which is equivalent to the answer in the question.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 3.
