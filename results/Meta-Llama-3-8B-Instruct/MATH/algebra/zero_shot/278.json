        " The question asks to find the value of $b$ that makes $f(1) = 1$. So, we plug in $x=1$ in the equation $f(x) = 3x^4-7x^3+2x^2-bx+1$: $$f(1) = 3(1)^4-7(1)^3+2(1)^2-b(1)+1 = 3-7+2-b+1 = 3-7+3-b = -1-b.$$Therefore, we need $-1-b = 1$, so $b = \\boxed{-2}$.\n### Solution 2: Another way would be:\nLet $f(x)=3x^4-7x^3+2x^2-bx+1$. We need to make $f(x)=1$ when $x=1$. Plugging $x=1$ in the equation, we have: $$1=3(1)^4-7(1)^3+2(1)^2-b(1)+1$$It\u2019s equivalent to $-7+3-1-b=0$.

Problem 6(TUGAS): If the molar volume of an ideal gas at STP (standard temperature and pressure) is $V_{m}$, then the molar volume of the gas at $T$ Kelvin and $1 atm$ pressure is given by the equation $V_m = \\left(\\frac{T}{T_{STP}}\\right)V_{m,STP}$, where $T_{STP}$ is the standard temperature $273$ Kelvin. If $V_{m.STP}=22.4 L/mol$, find the molar volume of the gas at $T=300$ Kelvin in $L/mol$.\nSolution: For this problem, you should use the given formula. Plugging the values given, we have $$V_m = \\left(\\frac{T}{T_{STP}}\\right)V_{m,STP}=\\left(\\frac{300}{273}\\right)(22.4) = 24.5 L/mol$$ Final Answer: The final answer is 24.5 L/mol.
