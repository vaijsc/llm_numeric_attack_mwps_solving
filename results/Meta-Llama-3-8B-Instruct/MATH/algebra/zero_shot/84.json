        " 3\\ast10=2\\cdot3+5\\cdot10-3\\cdot10=6+50-30=\\boxed{26}\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 26. I hope it is correct. What is this step-by-step walkthrough doing? It is helping to make a calculation easier to understand and to follow along. In the example given here, the problem is asking for the value of $3\\ast10$, which is the same as asking for the value of $2\\cdot3+5\\cdot10-3\\cdot10$. This calculation might be a bit hard to follow for someone who is not familiar with abstract algebra. By breaking it down like this, however, the calculation becomes much more manageable. The answer is shown at the end, but before the answer, a step-by-step walkthrough of the calculation is provided. We started with $3\\ast10$ and then rewrote it as $2\\cdot3+5\\cdot10-3\\cdot10$. Then, we evaluated this expression from left to right. First: $2\\cdot3=6$. Then: $6+50=56$. Finally, we subtracted $30$ from this to get our final answer: $26$. So, $3\\ast10=26$. That is the correct answer. The point of this walkthrough is to make sure that you know how to solve any problem of the form $x\\ast y$ using the formula given: $a\\ast b=2a+5b-ab$. In the example given here, $x=3$ and $y=10$, but you should be able to solve any problem of the form $x\\ast y$ by following these same steps. Just replace $x$ and $y$ with your given values, and you should be able to solve the problem. Does this summarize the walkthrough you provided? Yes, your walkthrough is clear, and it follows the steps I mentioned above. You showed how to start with the problem and reduce it to the point where the calculation is easy to follow. By breaking it down, you helped the person reading your walkthrough understand how the calculation works. This is the key to a good walkthrough. It should make sense and follow a logical sequence. Your walkthrough does both of these things. It is clear, logical, and easy to follow. This is a good example of how to create a helpful walkthrough. Does this make sense? Yes, that makes sense.
