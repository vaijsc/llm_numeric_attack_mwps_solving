    "solution": "Suppose that the dimensions of the rectangular prism are given by $x$, $y$, and $z$, such that $xy = 30, yz = 180,$ and $zx = 24$. If we multiply all three equations together, we get that $xy \\cdot yz \\cdot zx = (xyz)^2 = 30 \\cdot 180 \\cdot 24$. Using prime factorizations, we find that the right-hand side is equal to $(2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5) \\times (2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5) \\times (2^3 \\cdot 3) = 2^6 \\cdot 3^4 \\cdot 5^2$.

        " We know that the volume of a right rectangular prism is $ABC=abc$, where $a, b, c$ are the lengths of its edges.  Each face has an area given by $ab$ for its length and $sc$ for the width.  We are given that the areas of two of these faces are $30, 180$.  So we can see that $sc=30$, so that $c=30/s$.  Also, we can see that $ab=180$, so that $a=180/b$. Substituting these into the volume, we can write\n$$ABC = abc = b(180/b)(30/s) = 5400/b^2s.$$We know from the area calculation that $s=180/b$, so now we have\n$$ABC = \\frac{5400}{b^2(180/b)} = 30.$$A final observation is that $b$ and $s$ must be integer.  $b=2,3,...$ since $180/b$ is integer.  We can compute $s=9,$ resulting in a volume of $\\boxed{2700}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2700. I hope it is correct. For this exercise you can plug numbers into $ab=180$ and $sc=30$ to verify the values.  Post your answer to ensure whether your logic is correct.\nFurther, the solution doesn\u2019t require knowledge of geometry, so students with backgrounds in algebra will also find this problem approachable.  Therefore, it can be used to warm up students with an algebra background and to provide another opportunity for students to practice working with integer variables.  The logic and its use in real-world scenarios add significance to the problem. If any one of the dimensions is not an integer, then the volume must also not be an integer.  Hence, we are ensuring that our volume is an integer.  We have a solution to this exercise I.  You may write your own follow-up questions.

There is one more constraints between two integer.\nIf $a=1$, then $b=30$, $c=6$ or $c=3$.\nIf $b=1$, then $a=30$, $c=6$ or $c=3$.\nThe edges are the perimeter of the coordinate - $3\\le a,b,c\\le 6$.\nIf we derive any one of these values of $a$ or $b$ (for instance, take $a$), then when we compute the volume then we get, $abc=30\\cdot6=180$ which is not match to our initial value 24.\nTherfore we take another edge length values $b=3, c=6$ and $b=6,c=3$ are the valid value of the area 30 and 180.\n#### Volume of the prism\nThe volume is $$\\boxed{36}$$ cubic centimeters.\nSolution is here.!\nCalculates and explore geometry, algebra and other subjects with different math questions. | Python coding practice or hobby with diverse tutorials, projects, data analysis, machine learning and artificial intelligence . ||\n|| ![](../images/Bookmark.png) Bookmark: Solution of \u201cProblematic Prisms\u201d ||\n|| ![](../images/icon.png) Download PDF ||\n|| ![](../images/icon.png) Email ||\n|| ![](../images/icon.png) Print ||\n|| ![](../images/icon.png) Share ||\n|| ![](../images/icon.png) Post ||\nBefore we attempt the question, let\u2019s break it down into several parts:\n    - Understand the problem\n    - Write out the given information (Sell me the problem)\n    - Identify the important values (Important values)\nNow, let\u2019s solve the problem step by step:\n1. **Understand the problem**: We are given a right rectangular prism (a rectangular prism with all its faces being rectangles) with three edges. The areas of the rectangle faces are given as 30, 180, and 24 square centimeters. Our task is to find the volume of",
        " \nSolution. The first step is to consider the factors of 30 and 180. If we use a factor of 30 as one of the edge lengths of the prism, and a factor of 180 as the product of the other two edge lengths, then the product of the lengths must be equal to the area.\nLet $a, b, c$ denote the edge lengths of the prism. Then by the above consideration, we may assume that one of the edge lengths is a factor of 30, another is a factor of 180, and the third is the difference of these factors.\nWe first consider the factors of 30, namely $1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30.$ Similarly, the factors of 180 are $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 30, 36, 45, 60, 90, 180.$ Combining these factors, we find all possible ways of using the factors as edge lengths of the prism are:\n\\begin{align*}\n&1, 2, 15: & 1\\cdot 2\\cdot 15=30\\\\\n&1, 3, 10: & 1\\cdot 3\\cdot 10=30\\\\\n&1, 5, 6: & 1\\cdot 5\\cdot 6=30\\\\\n&1, 2, 30: & 1\\cdot 2\\cdot 30=60\n\\end{align*}\nOnly $(1, 2, 15)$ and $(1, 3, 10)$ allow for the desired edge length $c$ to have a factor of 30. Moving on to find the areas of the rectangles corresponding to these options, we have:\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\Rightarrow\\quad (a, b, c)=(1, 2, 15)\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad ab=2\\\\\n&\\Rightarrow\\quad (a, b, c)=(3, 10, 6), \\quad (a, b, c)=(1, 30, 3) \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad ab=10\n\\end{align*}\nOf these, only $(1, 2, 15)$ gives an area of 30, which is the",
        " \nThere are three faces of this rectangular prism that are given in terms of area. We can use this information to set up a system of linear equations that allows us to determine the dimensions of the box:\nLet the dimensions of the box be that of $x$, $y$, and $z$ in centimeters. Then the volume of the box is $\\text{V} = xyz$ cubic centimeters.\nFrom the fact that one face has area $30$ square centimeters, we deduce that the area $xy$ is $30$. Thus, we have that $xy = 30$. From the fact that another face has an area of $180$ square centimeters, we have that the product $yz$ is equal to $180$, implying that $yz = 180$. Finally, we have that the area of the face having area $24$ square centimeters must have dimensions such that $xz = 24$.\nThese conditions are equivalent to the linear system:\n$$\\begin{cases} xy &= 30 \\\\ yz &= 180 \\\\ xz &= 24 \\end{cases}$$\nWe can rewrite this system in terms of $x$, $y$, and $z$, and then provide a solution. By the fact that $xy = 30$, we can divide both sides by $y$, yielding $x = \\frac{30}{y}$. In a similar manner, we have $y = \\frac{180}{z}$ and $z = \\frac{24}{x}$. We can then substitute these values into $\\frac{30}{y}$ to obtain that $x = \\frac{30}{\\frac{180}{z}} = \\frac{30z}{180}= \\frac{1}{6}z$. From the fact that $z = \\frac{24}{x}$, we can then substitute in $\\frac{1}{6}z$ to get that $z = \\frac{24}{\\frac{1}{6}z} = 144$. By the fact that $y = \\frac{180}{z}$, we have $y = \\frac{180}{144} = \\frac{5}{3}$.\nThen, the volume, in cubic centimeters, of this rectangular prism is equal to $xyz = \\frac{1}{6}\\cdot \\frac{5}{3}\\cdot144 = \\boxed{240}$.\nPlease verify this question.

Here are the steps:\nStep 1:\nFind the factors of 30, 24, and 180.\nFor 30: 1,2,3,5,6,10,15,30\nFor 24: 1,2,3,4,6,8,12,24\nFor 180: 1,2,3,4,5,6,9,10,12,15,18,20,30,36,45,60,72,90,180\nStep 2:\nMatch the product of the factors from 30 and 24 with the factors from 180.\nxy = 30, yz = 180, and xz = 24.\nWe have matched xy = 6, yz = 8, and xz = 3.\nSo, we have x = 6, y = 5, and z = 3.\nStep 3:\nFind the volume.\nThe volume is the product of the edge lengths, so the volume is:\nx * y * z = 6 * 5 * 3 = 90 cubic centimeters.",
        " \nThe areas of faces of rectangular prism are the product of lengths of its dimensions. We know the areas of three faces of the prism are 30, 180 and 24 cm$^2$, so let\u2019s consider them one by one:\n1. The area of the first face is 30 cm$^2$. Let\u2019s assume the length of this face is $l$. Then, the width is $\\frac{30}{l}\\text{ cm}$ and the height is 1 cm. We can express the area of the second and third faces by similar logic. The area of the second face is 180 cm$^2$, so its length is 6 cm, its width is 30 cm and the height is 1 cm. Similarly, the area of the third face is 24 cm$^2$, so its length is 4 cm, its width is 6 cm and the height is 1 cm. Let\u2019s summarise the dimensions of the rectangular prism:\nLength: l, Width:  $\\frac{30}{l}$ , Height: 1\nLength: 6, Width: 30, Height: 1\nLength: 4, Width: 6, Height: 1\nNow, the volume of the prism is the product of its dimensions. So, its volume is:\nl \\* $\\frac{30}{l}$ \\* 1 + 6 \\* 30 \\* 1 + 4 \\* 6 \\* 1\nTo find the volume, we have to simplify this expression:\n1. 6(30) = 180\n2. 30/l = (30/l) \\* 1 = (30/l) \\* l/l = 30/l\n3. 4(6) = 24\nTherefore, the volume of the rectangular prism is:\n(30) + 180 + 24\n= 234\ncm$^3$\nSo, the volume of the rectangular prism is 234 cubic centimeters. Final Answer: The final answer is 234. I hope it is correct.  Final Answer: The final answer is 234. I hope it is correct.  Final Answer: The final answer is 234. I hope it is correct.",

        " First, we know that $30=6\\cdot5$, so one edge length is $6$, and the other, say, length is $5$. We cannot consider it as $30=\\boxed{1}\\cdot30$ in which the other two edge lengths are both $30$, because they are not integer. Then we create two cases for the longest, say, edge length. Case 1: the edge length is $6$. Let $a$ and $b$ be the face areas with $6$ as one edge length. Since $a\\le24$ and $180$, we cannot have $a=6$ and $b=180$. So, we must have $a=6$ and $b=24$. As a result, the edge length is $6$ and the other two are $5$ and $4$. Hence, the volume is $6\\cdot5\\cdot4=\\boxed{120}$. Case 2: the edge lengths are both $6$ and one edge length is $3$. Then we have $a=30$ and $b=180$ which is not possible. So, the edge lengths are all $6$ such as Case 1. Final Answer: The final answer is 120.
