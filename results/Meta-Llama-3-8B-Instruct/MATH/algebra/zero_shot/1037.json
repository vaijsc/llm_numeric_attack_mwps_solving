The first step is to try to find a common denominator and to rewrite the equation accordingly.\nThe common denominator is $(2r-7)$. The equation can now be rewritten as $$6r^2 -19r - 7 = 4r^2 -6r -21,$$ or equivalently, $$2r^2 -3r-4 = 0.$$\nWe can now solve for $r$ using the quadratic formula: $$r=\\frac{3\\pm \\sqrt{57}}{4}.$$ Since the value of $r$ must be a real number, $\\sqrt{57}>0$.

        " Let\u2019s try to write the fraction as an equivalent fraction in the form of $(4r-3)$. \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{6r^2 -19r - 7}{2r-7} &= 4r-3\\\\\n\\Rightarrow 6r^2 -19r - 7 &= (4r-3)(2r-7)\\\\\n&= 8r^2 -26r + 14.\n\\end{align*}Rearranging the terms, we obtain $$6r^2 -19r - 7 = 8r^2 -26r + 14.$$But the left side must be equal to the right side. We can now set both equal to $L$, say. Then, we have $$L = L \\quad \\Rightarrow 6r^2 -19r - 7 = 8r^2 -26r + 14.$$Subtracting both sides by $6r^2$, we have $$-19r - 7 = -8r^2 -26r + 14.$$Next, we subtract both sides by $-8r^2$ to get $$-7 = -36r+14,$$ and finally subtract 14 to get $$-21 = -36r,$$ or $$36r = 21.$$Thus, $$r = \\frac{21}{36} = \\boxed{\\frac{7}{12}}.$$How is that? What do you think?\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\frac{7}{12}. I hope it is correct.###triangle-primerisquare-primecircle-prim Meadows-prime Meadows-primedefinition202113901999-04-15T08:5494.500 TheinstructionfeaturedimageoftheMeadowsprimesquareisgeneric.|hasenhancedfeatures|https://www.openproblems.be/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/UKUndergraduateMathsChallenges2021.jpg\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\frac{7}{12}.

        " We have\n\\begin{align*} \\frac{6r^2 -19r - 7}{2r-7} &= 4r-3\\\\ (6r^2 -19r - 7) &= (4r-3)(2r-7). \\end{align*}\nWe expand the right-hand side, which yields\n\\begin{align*} 6r^2 -19r - 7 &= 8r^2-26r+21\\\\\n6r^2 -8r^2 -19r +26r - 7+21 &= 0\\\\\n-3r^2 +7r +14 &= 0 \\end{align*}\nIf a quadratic equation is a sum of two functions, then we can set each one equal to zero and solve for $r$. Our equation here is\n$$-3r^2 +7r +14 = 0.$$\nFactoring this equation gives us\n\\begin{align*}\n-3r^2+7r+14&=0\\\\\n(3r+2)(-r+7)&=0\n\\end{align*}\nwhich gives us\n\\begin{align*}\n3r+2&=0 \\qquad\\quad\\quad -r+7=0\\\\\nr&=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}} \\qquad\\;\\; r=7\n\\end{align*}\nFrom above, we discard $r=7$ since it\u2019s the value of $r$ that gives the denominator zero, and thus, we cannot divide by zero.\nThe value of $r$ is $\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -\\frac{2}{3}. I hope it is correct.={\"/math/2/7-3/r\"-{\"-1\"}}\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -\\frac{2}{3}. I hope it is correct."
