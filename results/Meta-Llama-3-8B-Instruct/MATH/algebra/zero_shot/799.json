        " $\\boxed{x=3}$\nWe can approach this question by assuming what each expression is, until we find the solution. First, multiply both sides by $x-1$. It gives us\n\\begin{align*}\nx+1 &= \\frac{(x-2)(x-1)}{x+2}\\\\\n(x+1)(x+2) &= (x-2)(x-1)\n\\end{align*}Now let\u2019s think about what could plug into the LHS. We know that we can take away the $(x+1)(x+2)$ because there\u2019s a common factor of $(x+1)(x-1)$ in both sides. And, since we can cancel that out by plugging in $(x+1)$ to the LHS and get 0(Can we say that this is a coincidence?). All that we have to do is to get what we want.\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\left\\lvert(x+1)(x+2) - (x-2)(x-1)\\right\\rvert\\\\\n&=\\left|(x+2)\\left(x+1\\right)-(x-1)(x-2)\\right|\\\\\n&=\\left(x^2+3x+2-x^2+3x-2\\right)\\\\\n&=6x\n\\end{align*}\nThere\u2019s no way that $6x$ would be 0, so that means that x\\neq\\frac{0}{6x}x\\neq0. We know that $x\\neq0$ because, if $x=0$, the equation is undefined.\nWe can plug in 3, and see if it would work. \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{3+1}{3-1} &= \\frac{3-2}{3+2}\\\\\n\\frac{4}{2} &= \\frac{1}{4}\\\\\n2 &= \\frac{1}{4} \\color{red}{\\text{YEET!!!}}\n\\end{align*}And we can see that we get an error, so $x=3$ is a solution. We can prove it by plugging it in to the original equation. \\begin{align*}\n&\\frac{3+1}{3-1}=\\frac{3-2}{3+2}\\\\\n&=\\frac{4}{2}=\\frac{1}{4}\\\\\n",

To do that, we would check the solution by plugging back in the value of $x$ into the original equation. Can you check the value $x=-2$ to see if it satisfies the equation?### ",

        " \nGiven the equation: $\\frac{x+1}{x-1} = \\frac{x-2}{x+2}$\nOur goal is to solve for $x$.\nFirst, we need to make sure that the denominators are the same, so let\u2019s multiply both sides of the equation by their product, the product rule! (You did it, xD)\n$\\frac{x+1}{x-1} = \\frac{x-2}{x+2} \\\\ \\frac{(x-1)(x+1)(x-2)(x+2)}{(x-1)(x+2)} = \\frac{(x-1)(x+1)(x-2)(x+2)}{(x-2)(x+2)}$\nNow, the denominators are equal, but we still need to be careful. Any like terms or things we can make equal to each other?\nDo you see what I did there? Let me explain. We have $\\frac{(x-1)(x+1)(x-2)(x+2)}{(x-1)(x+2)}$ and $\\frac{(x-1)(x+1)(x-2)(x+2)}{(x-2)(x+2)}.$ We have common denominators! Now, we can multiply them together (since they\u2019re equivalent) and cancel out the top and bottom. When we do that, we get $x-1 = x-2.$\nAha! Equations! Some of our numbers have canceled, leaving us with $x-1 = x-2.$ This one is an easy fix! We can subtract $x-1$ from both sides and get $0 = -1.$ Whoops, that doesn\u2019t actually help (it\u2019s still super positive)!\nAnd here we are! I know, you want to give up. But think about it. Think really, really hard. What do we have in common?\nYou know what? That\u2019s right! We both hate subtracting the same number from both sides. That\u2019s because $0 = -1$ is true. The resulting equation is in fact true. When you subtract $x$ from both sides, suddenly we have $-1 = -1.$ So, somehow, magically, $0 = -1$ isn't true, and instead, we have $-1 = -1.$ If we add $1$ to both sides, we get $0 = 0.$\nBecause we know",
        " To make things easier, we can simplify our equation:\n$$\\frac{x+1}{x-1} = \\frac{x-2}{x+2}$$\nSimplifying will take out the fractions in the denominators. It might look something like:\n$$(x+1)(x+2) = (x-1)(x-2)$$\nWe can multiply them to continue:\n$$x^2 + 3x + 2 = x^2 - 3x +2$$\nNow we can simplify the rest of the equation further:\n$$6x = 0$$\nThe rest will follow from this. Can you finish solving for x?\nAnswer: $x = 0$\nSolving for $x$ begins with solving for $6x$. Since $6x=0$, we can divide both sides by $6$ to get $x=0$. Therefore, $\\boxed{x=0}$ is the solution to the equation.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is x=0. I hope it is correct. I hope it is helpful. Let me know if you have any further questions!
