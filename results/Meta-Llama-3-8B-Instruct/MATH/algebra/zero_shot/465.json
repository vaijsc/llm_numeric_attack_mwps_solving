        " Start by letting the first term equal $x$. We are given that $x=a-d$. Where a is the second and d is the third. This is simply because you have the sequence as $x$, $(x+d)$,$(x+d+d)$,$(x+d+d+d)$ so the second is equal to $x+d$. The third is equal to $x+2d$. So the question says that $x=(x+2d)-(x+d)$. Canceling $x$, we obtain $d$. So $x=d$. We are given that the fourth term is 8 so $x+3d=8$. We have $d=x$ so substitute to solve for x. $x+3x=8$, so $4x=8$. So $x = 2$, which is the right answer.

        " Let $a$ be the first term of the arithmetic sequence.  Since the first term of the arithmetic sequence equals the third minus the second, we have $a=a+d$ for some $d$ since this difference is constant. We also have that $a+d+d=8,$ or $a+2d=8$. Subtracting $a$ and subtracting $a+d$, we multiply by $2$ to get the desired result: $a+d+d=8\\Rightarrow a+2d=8\\Rightarrow a=8-2d$. Now, $8-2d=8-2d\\Rightarrow 8-2d+d=d$ which yields $8-2d+d=8\\Rightarrow\\boxed{a=4}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 4. I hope it is correct.   Final Answer: The final answer is 4.

        " We are told that the first term of an arithmetic sequence equals the third minus the second. Hence, if we let $a$ be the first term, we get that $a=a+d$, since the second term is $a+d$ and the third term is $a+2d$. Simplifying, we get $d=0$.  Thus, $a=a+0$, or $a=a$.\nNow, the fourth term is $a+3d$, or $a+3(0)$, which is simply $a$. Hence, $a=8$, because the fourth term is $8$. $$a=\\boxed{8}$$ Final Answer: The final answer is 8.

        " \nUse the terms of an arithmetic sequence. Let $x$ be the first term, and let $d$ be the difference between any two consecutive terms.\nWe know that the first term equals the third minus the second. So, $x=(x + d) + d - d = 2x + d.$ Since $d=0$, we have $x = 0.$\nNow, we have the fourth term is $8$. This term is given by $x + 3d = x + 3(0) = x$. Since $x=0$, we have that this term is also $0.$\n### Analysis: \nHowever, 8 is not the 4th term of the sequence, since it is equal to 0.\u00a0 There is something wrong with this script\u2019s response. But, let\u2019s look closer. The pattern of the sequence is $x, x + d, x + 2d,$ and so on. The first term is $x$. If the third term is equal to the first minus the second, then it is written as $x - d = x$. But if we add $d$ to both sides, we get $2x = x + d$.\nThis is where we can solve for $x$. We have $x = d$. So, substituting $x = d$ into the original recurrence relation gives the 4th term as $x + 3d = d + 3d = 4d.$\nIn order to satisfy the condition, the 4th term must equal $8$, so $4d = 8$. Therefore, $d = 2$ and $x = d = 2$.\u00a0 So, the first term is $\\boxed{2}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2. I hope it is correct.",

        " Let $n$ be the first term. We know $n = a_1$. We also know $a_2 = n + d$ and $a_3 = a_1 + 2d = n + 2d$.

        " \nLet the first term be $a$. Then, $a = a + d - d = 2a - d$. Since $2a - d = a$, we have $d = a$. The sequence begins with $a$, then $a+d = a+a = 2a$, then $a+2d = a+2a = 3a$, and then $a+3d = a+3a = 4a$. So the terms are $a$, $2a$, $3a$, ... Now, let\u2019s solve for $a$.
