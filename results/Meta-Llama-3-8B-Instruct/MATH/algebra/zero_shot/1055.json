        " Can we find the multiples of three by looking at how we multiply by three?\nWhen we multiply a number by three, we add that number three times. For example, when we multiply 2 by three, we have:\n2 * 3 = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.\nSo, if we multiply a positive integer by three, we get a multiple of three. Now, let\u2019s focus on the 10 smallest positive multiples of three.\nWe start with 3 itself, the first multiple of three. Then, the next multiple is 3 + 3 = 6, and the next one is 6 + 3 = 9, and so on. We can continue adding three to the previous multiple to get the next multiple.\nAfter some thought, we find the 10 smallest positive multiples of three:\n3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30.\n### ",
        " The multiples of three are simply the number of times we can divide the number by 3.  For example, 3*1 = 3, 3*2 = 6, 3*3 = 9.\nThis is the 1st multiple.\nNow, 3*4 = 12, 3*5 = 15, 3*6 = 18, 3*7 = 21, 3*8 = 24, 3*9 = 27. But we want multiples of 10.\n### Ratio of multiples: Why don\u2019t try writing the multiples:\n3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27...each number is only 3 units apart (three) from the previous number.\nThat is, 6 - 3 = 3\nand\n9 - 6 = 3\nand\n12 - 9 = 3\n...\nSo, if we want the 1st 10 multiples, we need to add 3 nine times, after starting with 3. Then multiply: 3 + 3 + 3 + ... = 9*3 = 27. So, the 10th multiple is 27.\nSo, the sum of the 10 smallest positive multiples of three is 3 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 15 + 18 + 21 + 24 + 27 = 135.\nAnd find the remaining numbers:\n4*20 = 80,\n5*13 = 65,\n6*11 = 66,\n7*10 = 70,\n8*9 = 72,\n9*8 = 72,\nThe first 13, and we need 10, stop searching.\nRecall the table of multiples:\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 135. I hope it is correct. 294912\nHere is how we do it with Python:\n```\ndef sum_of_multiplies(n):\n    return sum([i for i in range(3, n*3+3, 3)])\n10 smallest positive multiples of three:\nprint(sum_of_multiplies(3))\nprint(sum(range(1, 4)))\n   Output:\n   sum([3, 6, 9]) = 18\n   sum([3, 6, 9]) = 18\n   ```\n   we will do the sums.\n   Here is how we do it with Python:\n```python",
        " 3 + 6 + 9 + ... + 30 = ? \nLet's start by thinking about the first multiple of 3, which is 3. The second multiple of 3 is 6, and it's 3 more than the first. The third multiple of 3 is 9, which is also 3 more than the second. We can keep going! The fourth multiple of 3 is 12, which is 3 more than the third, and so on.\nThe pattern here is that each multiple of 3 is 3 more than the previous one. We can add them all up using the sum formula:\n1 \u00d7 3 + 2 \u00d7 3 + 3 \u00d7 3 + ... + 10 \u00d7 3\nThis sum is equal to the sum of the first 10 multiples of 3. We can simplify the sum:\n3 + 6 + 9 + ... + 30 = ?\nIt looks like there's a pattern! The multiples of 3 are getting bigger and bigger. We can count them:\n3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30\nThat's 10 multiples! \nNow that we have all the multiples, we can add them up:\n3 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 15 + 18 + 21 + 24 + 27 + 30 = 150\nSo the sum of the 10 smallest positive multiples of 3 is 150!",

        " \nWe will find the sum of the 10 smallest positive multiples of 3. \nFirst, we know that we want to find: 3 + 6 + 9 + ... + 27 = ?\nTo find this sum, we know the formula for an arithmetic series:\n1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = n*(n+1)/2. \nSo, to find the sum, we have: \n3 + 6 + 9 + ... + 27 = 3*[(3-1) + (3-1) + ... + (3-1) + 3] / 2. \nNow, we know that we are looking for the sum of 10 terms. \nSo, we start by finding 10*(3-1) / 2. \n10*(3-1) = 10*2 = 20. \n20/2 is 10. \nSo, we have: \n3 + 6 + 9 + ... + 27 = 3*10 = 30.\nTherefore, the sum of the 10 smallest positive multiples of 3 is **30**.",

        " So what?\n#### Explanation:\nThe smallest positive multiple of 3 is 3, and after 3, the next multiple of 3 is 6, then 9, then 12, and so on. \nWe want the sum of the 10 smallest positive multiples of 3. Since the smallest positive multiples of 3 are 3, 6, 9, 12, ..., we should list the 10 smallest ones: \n3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30\n",
