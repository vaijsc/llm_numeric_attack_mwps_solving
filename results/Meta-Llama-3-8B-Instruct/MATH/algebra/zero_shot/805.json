If you have any question let me know. I will be there for you. You can also ask me any other question if you have any. I am here to help you. Here's the solution in Word. This solution starts by multiplying all the terms together on the numerator, and separately multiplying all the terms together on the denominator. In the numerator $10r^3$, $4r^6$ the code we multiply by multiplying the coefficients and then raising them to the power of the sum of their exponents. On the denominator, the code we multiply all the terms together, and in this case, all the terms are raised to the power of $r^4$. This can then be taken out of the fraction. Then the final fraction is simplified by noticing that the $r^4$ on the numerator and denominator cancels. We then have $2\\cdot5\\cdot2r^9=20r^9$. To make sure that you can understand the code we multiplied when combining two terms you can do $r^2 \\times r^3 = r^{2+3} = r^5$. Same thing happens for $r^4$. So that in the numerator we have $\\left( 10 r ^3 \\right)$, then $\\left( 4 r^6 \\right)$. We multiply $10$, $4$ and we get $40$ and $r^3$, $r^6$ we get $r^9$, so $\\left( 40 r^9 \\right)$. The same thing we do on the denominator we get $8 r^4$. We do $2 r^2$ and then multiply with $2 r^2$ then we get $4 r^4$. So we get $\\frac{40 r^9}{4 r^4}$, we simplify and on both sides we have $r^4$ and we take out of the fraction and we get $\\boxed{20 r^9}$. I hope this help you to understand the step by step solution. ",

Then we simplified the numerator by multiplying 10 and 4. Now, we looked at the denominator and noted that there are powers of $r$ in both numerator and denominator. We divided powers of $r$ with the like terms and got $\\frac{40}{8}.$ Finally, we simplified the fraction $\\frac{40}{8}=5.$\nWe sent the remaining $r^9$ and $r^4$ terms to the same side and got the final answer as $\\boxed{5r^5}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 5r^5.

The book presents a problem with modern education, but doesn\u2019t provide any specific solutions.  The report brings attention to the fact that a lot of students are not achieving the standard, and it highlights the factors that are responsible for this.  It is not a new concept in education, and it is not something that is unique to or specific to this particular system.  It is a problem that has been consistent throughout history.
