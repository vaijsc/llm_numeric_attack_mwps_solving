        " The $y$-intercept is given as $(0,-p)$ so, for $x=0$, the equation of the parabola is $y=p$. Further, the vertex of the parabola is $(p,p)$. For Vertex, vertex = (-b/2a,p-(b^2-4ac)/4a) Now, comparing x and y values, we can write $p = -\\frac{b}{2a} \\implies b = -2ap$ and $p = p - \\frac{b^2}{4a} + \\frac{c}{a} \\implies p = p + \\frac{4ap^2+c}{a} \\implies 4ap^2+4ap+c = 0$ On simplifying this equation, we get -2ap = c (Given, $p\\neq 0$, So, $c\\neq0$) $4ap^2+4ap+c = 0$ $4ap(p+\\frac{1}{2})+c = 0$ $c = -4ap(p+\\frac{1}{2})$ $c = -2ap^2-ap$ On comparing it with $c = -\\frac{b^2}{4a}+a$, We can write $-2ap^2-ap = -\\frac{b^2}{4a}+a$ $2ap^2+4ap+b = 0$ On simplifying this equation, we get b = 4ap Final Answer: The final answer is 4ap.

        " $b$\nFirst, $(0,-p)$ is the $y$-intercept. Since $y= ax^2+bx+c$, $c=-p$.  We are given that the $y$-intercept passes through $(0,-p)$, so $-p=ax^2+bx-c=a(0)^2+b(0)+(-p)=a(0)+b(0)-p=-p$, which gives $0=b-p$, so $b=p$.\nSecond, $(p,p)$ is the vertex. This means that $p$ is the $x$-coordinate of the vertex.  The parabola opens upwards, so the parabola is $ax^2+bx+c$, with $a>0$ and $c=-p$. The parabola goes through the vertex, so $p=ax^2+bx-c$, where $x=p$. Replacing $c$ with $-p$, we obtain $p=a(p^2)+bp+p$, which simplifies to $0=(p-a)p+b$. Let\u2019s discuss. Must $(p-a)p+b=0$ hold by accident? Or must it hold in general? The later will be much more likely. In particular, note that $p=a$ when $a=p$. So the quadratic has zeros $p,a$.  If it always holds, that the function is always factored like this, then the second factor is $b$. So the parabola opens upwards, and $a=(p-a)$ and $p-b$, and when the two are equal to zero, then the two values of $a$ are zero, that is $0=(p-a)p+b$. But $p-a=0$ and $0-a=0$. This must hold for any $p$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is p. I hope it is correct. Also, the quadratic $0=(p-a)p+b$ forms a factored equation, with solutions $a$, $p$.  If $a=0$, then $(p-a)=0$ and then $p-b$ will also equal zero.  And if $a$ and $p$ hold this property, then in general $(p-a)p+b$ will be zero.  So we know in general, we know the value of $b$. Since $p-a=0$, then $p=b$, so $0=(p-a)p+p$ is equivalent to $0=b(p-b)+b",
        " First, we know that the y-intercept is given by the point $(0,-p)$. In order to achieve this, the $x$-term of the function $ax^2+bx+c$ should equal 0 at $x=0$, which implies $c=-p$.\n### Next, we are also given that the parabola has vertex $(p,p)$. For any general quadratic function of the form $y=ax^2+bx+c$, the vertex is given by the midpoint of its axis of symmetry. The $x$-coordinate of the axis of symmetry is $-\\frac{b}{2a}$, so we have $$-\\frac{b}{2a}=p\\Rightarrow \\boxed{b=-2ap}.$$So $b=-2ap$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is b=-2ap. I hope it is correct.  I used a different method to approach the problem, but it looks like this one is more straightforward.\n### Comment:  Another way to solve this is to use the fact that the parabola has vertex $(p,p)$, so the vertex form of the parabola is $y=a(x-p)^2+p$. The $y$-intercept is given by $(0,-p)$, so plugging in $x=0$, we get $-p=a(0-p)^2+p\\Rightarrow c=-p$ and $a=-1$. Therefore, $$y=ax^2+bx+c=-x^2+(-2p)x+p=-x^2-2px+p$$ which yields $b=\\boxed{-2p}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is b=-2p. I hope it is correct.  I agree with this method too!",
        " To find $b$, we need to find $a$ and $c$ first. It is a parabola that passes through points $(0, -p)$ and $(x,p)$ (which is the vertex of the parabola).

We also substitute $(x, p)$ into the equation of the parabola and get $p = ax^2 + bx - p$ $\\Rightarrow\\quad p = ax^2 + bx -p$ Simplifying the equation, we get $p = ax^2 + bx - p$ $\\Rightarrow\\quad 2p = ax^2 + bx$ Now we have the equation of a quadratic equation with a constant term of $0$.

        " Let\u2019s write an equation of a parabola in general form, $y=ax^2+bx+c$. We are given that the parabola $y=ax^2+bx+c$ has vertex $(p,p)$  and $y$-intercept $(0,-p)$, where $p\\neq\n0$.  By definition of the vertex, the parabola also contains the point $(p,p)$.

        " First, let\u2019s find the vertex form of the equation. \nSuppose that the parabola is $y=ax^2+bx+c$. Then $ax^2+bx+c = a(x-h)^2 + k$, where the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $h$ and the $y$-coordinate of the vertex is $k$. Since the vertex is $(p,p)$, it implies that $h=p$ and $k=p$. So the equation $ax^2+bx+c$ becomes:\n$a(x-p)^2+p$. Now, we know that $-p$ is the $y$-intercept, so, $a(p)^2+p = -p$. Therefore, $a = \\frac{-1}{p}$.
