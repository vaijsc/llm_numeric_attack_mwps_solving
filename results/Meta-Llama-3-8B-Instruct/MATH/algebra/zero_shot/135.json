        " \nStep 1: We can write two equations from the information given. The first equation is the form of a line parallel to $3x-7y=65$. We can convert it to the slope-intercept form, $y=mx+b$. First, we need to rearrange the equation: \\begin{align*}\n7y&=3x-65\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad y&=-\\frac{3}{7}x+\\frac{65}{7}\n\\end{align*}The slope of this line is $m=-\\frac{3}{7}$. Since the line is parallel, it has the same slope. The line passing through the points $(7,4)$ and $(0,K)$ is $y=-\\frac{3}{7}x+b$. We can find the slope from this equation again: \\begin{align*}\n-\\frac{3}{7}&=\\frac{-3}{7}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad b&=K+7\\left(-\\frac{3}{7}\\right)\\\\\n&=K-3\n\\end{align*}\nStep 2: The line passing through these two points is $y=-\\frac{3}{7}x+b$. We can also find $b$ when $x=7$ and $y=4$. Plugging in, we obtain: \\begin{align*}\n4&=-\\frac{3}{7}(7)+b\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad b&=4+\\frac{21}{7}=K+\\frac{-21}{7}+3\\\\\n&=K-3\n\\end{align*}Setting these two equations of $b$ equal to each other, we have: \\begin{align*}\nK-3&=K-3\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad K&=\\boxed{K}\n\\end{align*}Step 3: The value of K is any number. This is because when we solved for $b$, we simply got $K-3$, which includes any value K. This is why the problem says any number. So, our final answer is K=\\boxed{K}, which simplifies to a single number if you know the range or type of number for K.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is any number. I hope it is correct.

Now we know the slope of the line we want is also $-\\frac{3}{7}$ since we are looking at a line parallel to the line $3x-7y=65$.\n### Step 1:\nKnowing this, we can plug in the point $(7,4)$ into the equation $y = mx + c$ for $m = -\\frac{3}{7}$, to get\n$4 = -\\frac{3}{7} * 7 + c$\nSolving for $c$ by subtracting $\\frac{3}{7} * 7$ we get\n$4 = -3 + c$\nAdding $3$ to both sides\n$7 = c$\nSo the equation becomes $y = -\\frac{3}{7}x + 7$. We know the equation passes through the point $(7,4)$ so the equation is correct.\n### Step 2:\nUse the line $y = -\\frac{3}{7}x + 7$ to find $K$.\nWe know the line $y = -\\frac{3}{7}x + 7$ passes through $(0,K)$, so plug in the $x$ and $y$ values into the equation\n$K = -\\frac{3}{7} * 0 + 7$\nSimplify by multiplying $-\\frac{3}{7}$ by $0$ (which is equal to 0) and you get\n$K = 7$\nThe value of $K$ is $\\boxed{7}$.\nWritten by a 14 year old high school student. \nby EarthaMoon\n(1 rating)-earthamoon2019",

We know that $y = m(x-x_0) + y_0$, so $y = (-3/7)(x-7) + 4$. \n    Simplify \n    $$(3x+21)-7y = 4 \\implies -7y = 3x+17$$\n    $$7y = -3x-17 \\implies y = (3/7)x + 17/7$$\n    $$m' = (3)/7$$\n3. So we see the slope $m=m'$ stays the same, therefore the new line also has the slope $(-3)/7$, which passes through the point $(0,K)$:\n    $K = (3/7)(0) + 17/7 \\implies \\boxed{K=17/7}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 17/7.

First, find the slope of the line $3x-7y=65$.\nThe slope (m) of a line in the slope-intercept form $y=mx+b$ is found as m = b.\nThe given equation is not in slope-intercept form. However, we can rewrite the equation in the form $y = mx + b$.\n$3x - 7y = 65$\n$y = (3/7)x - 65/7$\nThe slope of the line is $m = (3/7)$.\n2. Now, the line parallel to $3x-7y = 65$ passes through the point $(7,4)$\n#### Line1\nCalculate the slope of the line that passes through the point $(7,4)$.\nm = (y2-y1)/(x2-x1) = (4-0)/(7-0) = 4/7\n3. Since both lines have the same slope (m = 4/7), the point $(0,K)$ is also on the line $y = (4/7)x + b$.\n#### Line2\nThe point $(7,4)$ on the line defines the equation $4 = (4/7)(7) + b$, which simplifies to $b = (4*(7) - 4*(4))/7$ or $b = 12/7$.\nThe equation of the line is: $y = (4/7)x + 12/7$.\n4.

        " Method # 1: Slope\nThe parallel line is distance 2 away from the line 65, and the line 65 is written in the form y=mx+b. We know that b = negative of a slope * x + b. If you solve for m, you get m = negative of b divided by x. The line to our question passes through the point (7,4).

Therefore m= negative of slight 7 / 3 = 7/3. So we'll use the point (7,4) and slope (7/3) to solve for K. (y1 - y2) / x1 \u2013 x2 = m.\nUse 4 - K / 7 - 0 = 7/3, 4 \u2013 K = 7. K = -3. However, since K represents the y value when x = 0, and x is positive, we cannot have a negative number.

        " To solve this problem, you need the slope of the given line, the slope of the line parallel to the given line, and the coordinates of the point where the parallel line intersects the vertical line $x=0$.Understanding the slope: A line in slope-intercept form (y = mx + b) can be interpreted as having a slope of m and passing through the point (0, b).The equation $3x-7y = 65$ in slope-intercept form is $y = (3/7)x + 65/7$, so it has a slope of $3/7$.Now, think about a parallel line. Parallel lines have the same slope. So, the parallel line also has a slope of $3/7$.Now, remember the coordinates of the point where the line intersects the vertical line $x=0$: (0, K).This point has a slope of 0, since it's a vertical line, which means that the line is horizontal. The horizontal line still has the same slope as the given line, so it also has a slope of $3/7$.In the point-slope formula for a line, (y - K) = (3/7)(x - 0), we see that we have a vertical line because the rise is equal to 0. This means that K = m(0) + c = 0(0) + c = c = 65/7. Thus, K = 65/7 = 9.25. The correct answer is 9.25.### Correct solution:\nThe given equation is $3x-7y=65$, which can be rewritten in the form $y=-\\frac{3}{7}x+\\frac{65}{7}$ and interpreted as having a slope of $m=-\\frac{3}{7}$. A line parallel to this equation will have the same slope $m=-\\frac{3}{7}$ as well.
