I hope it is correct.### Correct Approach 2\nLet\u2019s simplify.\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{\\frac56}w&=\\frac{42}3\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad\\frac{7}{{12}w}&=\\frac{14}3\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad\\frac{7}{{12}}&=\\frac{w}{3}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad w&=\\frac{3\\cdot 7}{{12}}\\\\\n&=\\frac{7}4\\\\\n&=\\boxed{\\frac12}\n\\end{align*} Note: You could either answer directly here or we could write as a mixed number with improper numerator: \\frac{14}{12} which simplified to 1\\frac12. Final Answer: The final answer is \\frac{1}{2}. I hope it is correct.### What part needs improvement?\nWe both made a step (or two) in the wrong way. I, personally, went to simplify both sides first, then it made the rest of the work easier. Here, you have to simplify the fractions first before doing anything else. Overall, it still takes some effort to work through those.### Would it be correct if we choose to write answer as a mixed number with improper numerator?\nYes, it is correct.  You can write the answer $\\frac12$ as a mixed number with an improper numerator.  The mixed number form of $\\frac12$ is $1\\frac12$.### Additional Assump?tions\nWe need to assume that none of the students knew how to convert improper fractions to mixed numbers.Indeed, if we have already understood how to convert improper fractions to mixed numbers, then we'd have used that approach to solve the problem. In",
        " \nFirst, convert the mixed number $\\frac{1\\frac16}w$ to an improper fraction: $\\frac{1\\frac16}w=\\frac{\\frac{7}{6}}{w}=\\frac{7}{6w}$.  Hence, $\\frac{\\frac{7}{6}}{w} = \\frac{42}3$.\n### Step-2\nNow, both sides of the given equation must be simplified equally. Rewrite 42 as 2*3*7 and utilize the improper fraction $7/(6w)$. For this, use fractions with identical denominators. This yields \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{7}{6w} &=\\frac{2*3*7}{3}\\\\\n6w\\cdot\\frac{7}{6w}&=3\\cdot2*3*7\\\\\n7&=2*3*7\n\\end{align*}To solve $w$, divide by the denominator and bottom it out, It can be seen that $w=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{7}}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\frac{3}{7}$.

        " $\\frac{8}{3}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 8/3. I hope it is correct. ### Explanation: Consider the fraction $\\frac{1\\frac16}w$ as $\\frac{5/6}w$. So, $$\\frac{5/6}w=\\frac{42}3$$  Cross multiply (To simplify this question, one must understand how to cross multiply two fractions. First, multiply the numerator of the first fraction with the numerator of the second fraction. Then, multiply the denominator of the first fraction with the denominator of the second fraction.                                                                      $$(5/6)w=42/3$$ Multiply both sides by 6. Now get the w side to have a denominator of 6 also.\n$$(5/6)w=42/3$$\n$$(5/6)(6)(w)=(6)(42)/3$$\n$$\\boxed{5w=84}$$ Divide both sides by 5.\n$$5w=84$$\n$$\\boxed{w=16/5}$$ The lowest form is $8/3$. Answer in reduced fraction.\n**Note:** Without simplifying we get $\\frac{16}{5}$ as the answer. We can put it in lowest terms. First, 8 is the number\u2019s greatest common divisor. Divide 8 on both sides.\n$\\frac{16}{5} = \\frac{8}{5}$\nThe denominator is already reduced. So, this the lowest form of the answer. You can\u2019t reduce the denominator more.\nThus, The answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{8}{3}}$. We could do it quickly. We find $\\frac{1\\frac16}w=\\frac{42}3$, implying $\\frac{5/6}w=\\frac{14}1$. Cross multiplying, we get $(5/6)w=14$. And by simplifying we quickly have $\\boxed{\\frac{8}{3}}$. So, the final answer is 8/3.
