        " You know how to solve for x in terms of y? The goal is to get the given equation in an equivalent form. That form is 4x=3y.\n### Concept 1: The goal is to solve the equation 4x=3y.\nAbstract: In linear equations, one may solve for one variable (V) in terms of the other variable (W). Typically we do that by subtracting, adding, or multiplying both sides by numbers and/or variables. So it makes sense to solve for x and y in terms of each other.\n### Math Stuff: Solve for x, 4x=3y.

        " \nGiven that $4x=3y$.  Let\u2019s add $2y$ to both sides.  That means we add $2y$ to the left side and we take this expression and we keep it the same.  That gives us $4x+2y = 3y+2y$, which reduces to $4x+2y = 5y$.  Then, subtract $2y$ from both sides.  That gives us $4x+2y-2y = 5y-2y$, which reduces to $4x = 3y$.  Now we notice that $\\frac{2x+y}{3x-2y}$ is a rational expression, in that it is a expression that is the result of dividing one expression, which is the numerator, by an expression, which is the denominator.  Then, we find that if we multiply the numerator by $1$ without changing its value and we multiply the denominator by $1$ without changing its value, we can rewrite our rational expression as $\\frac{2x+y}{3x-2y}=\\frac{(2x+y)(3x-2y)}{(3x-2y)(3x-2y)}$, which reduces to $\\frac{6x^2-4xy+3xy-2y^2}{9x^2-6xy+4y^2}$, which we can simplify by combining like terms. $\\frac{6x^2-4xy+3xy-2y^2}{9x^2-6xy+4y^2}=\\frac{6x^2+xy-2y^2}{9x^2-6xy+4y^2}=\\frac{(3x+y)(2x-y)}{(3x-2y)(3x-2y)}$.\nNow, we are asked to find the value of $\\frac{2x+y}{3x-2y}$, which we know is equal to $\\frac{(3x+y)(2x-y)}{(3x-2y)(3x-2y)}$.  We are given that $4x=3y$, so we first see that $3y=3(4x/3)=4x$, so we know that $y=4x/3$.  Now we know that $4x=3(4x/3)$, so we can say that $4x=4x",
        " $$\\frac{2x+y}{3x-2y}$$\n### Method: The problem is easier to solve if we simplify it. We know that $4x=3y$. So, $x=\\frac{3}{4}y$.
