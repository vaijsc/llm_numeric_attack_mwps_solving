Let\u2019s choose the point $(7,8)$ as our point $(x_1, y_1)$ to find the slope using this point.\nWe can write\n$y - 8 = m (x-7)$\nLet\u2019s use the point $(9,0)$ to solve for $m$:\n$0 - 8 = m (9-7)$\nSubtracting $8$ from both sides and simplifying gives us\n$-8 = 2m$\nDividing both sides by two, we find the slope:\n$m = -4$\nNow let\u2019s substitute this value back into the original equation:\n$y-8 = -4(x-7)$\nSimplifying and adding 8 gives us the final equation of the line:\n$y = -4x + 36$\nSo here, we find the slope is $m = -4$, and we have $b = 36$.

To find out the slope and y-intercept of the line, we must first find the slope m) and then find the y-intercept b). \nThe first line is that we get a slope that's not equal to zero, or else the line will be parallel. In other words, parallel lines do not intersect at a single point. Under these circumstances, we will define the slope by looking at the slope between the two given points. The function of the slope is the slope of the line. Y intercept is the intersection point of the line.\nIn order to get the slope, we can obtain the slope using the formula slope = (y2-y1) / (x2-x1), which is the slope formula. Now, given that we have the slope formula and that we have two points: (x1 , y1) = (7,8) and (x2, y2) = (9,0), we can figure out what the slope is.\nNext step is to get the y-intercept. In other words, if a line goes through the point (0,0), the y-intercept is simply the value of the point. \nWe have $y$ $=$ $mx$ $+$ $b$, we know $m$ and $b$, so $8$ $=$ $-1$ * $7$ $+$ $b= -7$ $+$ $b$\nThe line is $-7$ $+$ $b$.

In the point-slope form, $-8$ is the slope.  Solving for $y$ gives $$y = -8x + 8 + 56 = -8x + 64.$$  Therefore, the equation of the line is $y = -8x + 64$, so the $y$-intercept is $(0, 64)$.

Therefore, the equation of the line is y = -8x + 64, so the y-intercept is (0, 64). We then can easily find that the slope is -8 by looking at the coefficient before x. From this, we can also find y-intercept is 64. We know that slope and y-intercept sum to -8+64 = \\boxed{56}.

        " \nTo solve this problem, we need to find the slope and $y$-intercept of the line.\nFirst, we find the slope: The slope between $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ is $$m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}.$$ The points are $(7,8)$ and $(9,0)$, so we find $$m = \\frac{0 - 8}{9 - 7} = \\frac{-8}{2} = -4.$$ So the slope is $m = -4$.\n### Next, we can find the $y$-intercept. By definition, the line has the equation in the form $$y = m x + b,$$ where $m = -4$ is the slope. Plugging in one of the points, $(7,8)$, to find the $y$-intercept $b$, we have $$8 = -4(7) + b,$$ so $b = 8 + 28 = 36$. Hence, the equation of the line is $$y = -4 x + 36.$$\n### Now, we find the sum of the slope and $y$-intercept: $m + b = -4 + 36 = \\boxed{32}$. Final Answer: The final answer is 32.
