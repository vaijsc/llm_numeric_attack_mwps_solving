Since the movie theater is full and seats $100$, $x+y=100$.\n\nAdult tickets sell for $\\$9.00$ each, so a total of $9x$ dollars were collected from adults. Children tickets sell for $\\$5.00$ each, so a total of $5y$ dollars were collected from children. A total of $\\$640$ were collected, so $9x+5y=640$.\n\nWe now have two equations, $x+y=100$ and $9x+5y=640$. We now solve for $y$.\n\nWe multiply the first equation by $9$ so that we can eliminate the $x$ term: $9x+9y=900$. Then, we subtract the second equation from it to get $9x+9y-(9x+5y)=900-640 \\rightarrow 4y=260 \\rightarrow y=65$.\n\nTherefore, $\\boxed{65 \\text{ children tickets }}$ were sold.",

The coefficient of $x$ in the first equation is $1$, but the coefficient of $x$ in the second equation is $-1$ from the $- (900)(100-x)$. By equating the coefficients of $x$ in both equations, we have\n$$1=-900+900$$\nwhich results in $0$.

We also know that the number of children\u2019s tickets sold, $x$, is $9$, so the number of adult tickets sold must be $100-9=91$.

We have that \\begin{align*} S_n &= a_1(1-r^n) / 1-r\\\\ &= \\dfrac{9(1-(\\frac{1}{9})^n)}{1-\\frac{1}{9}} \\\\ &= 9 + \\dfrac{9\\cdot(-\\frac{5}{9})}{1-\\frac{1}{9}}(\\frac{1}{9})^n \\\\ &= 9 + \\frac{-5}{8}(\\frac{1}{9})",

The revenue from the theater is $\\$9$per adult ticket and $\\$5$ per child ticket, so the revenue can be described by\n\\begin{align*} 9a + 5c = 640. \\end{align*}\nThere are only $100$ seats, so the total number of adult and children tickets cannot exceed $100$.  This leads to the inequality\n\\begin{align*} a + c \\le 100. \\end{align*}\nThe integer solutions to $a + c = 100$ and $9a + 5c = 640$ are $a = 64, c = 36$ and $a = 58, c = 42$, but the first solution corresponds to the two inequalities.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 56.

        " First, let $A$ be the number of adult tickets sold and $C$ be the number of children's tickets sold. Then $A + C = 100$ and $9A + 5C = 640$. Now, we have a system of linear equations with two variables. \\begin{align*}\nA + C &= 100 \\\\\n9A + 5C &= 640.\n\\end{align*} We can solve the system of equations by finding $C$ from either equation and plugging it into the other equation. Solving the first equation for $C$, we get $C= 100-A$. Then, plugging this into the second equation, we get\n\\begin{align*}\n9A + 5(100-A) &= 640 \\\\\n9A+500-5A &= 640 \\\\\n4A &= 140 \\\\\nA &= 35\n\\end{align*}Now that we have the value of $A$, we can solve for $C$: $$C = 100-35= \\boxed{65.}$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 65.

Therefore, you can solve the system of linear equations \\begin{align*}\nA + C &= 100 \\\\\n9A + 5C &= 640.\n\\end{align*} given that you have enough information to eliminate one of the variables or you can can substitute one expression with another.\nIt seems that the elimination method has the same idea as elimination in algebra in solving a system of linear equations. Each time you eliminate one variable, you are getting further closer to the solution.\nI think that the substitution method is quite similar to how you would solve for one variable in terms of another, if there is no elimination possible.",

        " To determine how many children's tickets were sold, we need to first find how many adult tickets were sold and subtract it from 100 to find the number of children's tickets sold.\nLet $a$ be the number of adult tickets sold and $c$ be the number of children's tickets sold.\nWe are told that the theater collected $\\$640$in ticket sales.\nThe theater sold$640$ dollars worth of tickets, so the sum of the money from adult tickets and children's tickets is$\\$640$.\nThe value from the adult tickets is 9(a) because each adult ticket is sold for$\\$9.00$, and the value from the children's tickets is 5(c) because each children's ticket is sold for$\\$5.00$.\nWe are also given that\n$$a + c = 100.$$\nWe now form the equation:\n\\begin{align*} 9a + 5c &= 640 \\\\ 9a + 5(100 - a) &= 640. \\end{align*}\nSimplifying,\n$$9a + 500 - 5a = 640 \\Leftrightarrow 4a = 140 \\Leftrightarrow a = 35.$$\nNow, we find $c$:\n$$c = 100 - a = 100 - 35 = 65.$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 65.

        " First, let\u2019s convert the $\\$640$ into$100%$of the total, so that we can scale below. We need to divide $\\$640$ by the$\\$9$ price of an adult ticket. (We could have also divided $\\$640$ by$\\$5$ and subtracted from$100\\%, but that would have been a lot more complicated!)\n$$\\frac{\\640}{9} \\approx 71.11,$$so $$71.11\\%$$ of the tickets are adult tickets (i.e., $$\\frac{640}{9}$$ adult tickets).\nThis means that $$100\\% - 71.11\\% = 28.89\\%$$ of the tickets were children\u2019s tickets, which is $$\\frac{28.89}{100} \\cdot 100 = 28.89$$ children\u2019s tickets (only). We round down to the nearest whole number, because we can\u2019t sell a fraction of a ticket (a child can\u2019t be half a child).\n### Final Answer: The final answer is 28. So, the number of children\u2019s tickets sold is $\\boxed{28}$.\n#### If you have any difficulty in solving any specific problem in Mathematics, Compusutational Problem on Mathematics or any other problem, you can post it here.

        " Let $a$ be the number of adult tickets sold, and let $c$ be the number of children's tickets sold. We are given that the theater collected $\\$640$ in ticket sales, so $$9a+5c=640.$$ We also know that the theater is full and can seat $100$ patrons, so we have $$a+c=100.$$ We can now solve the system of equations \\begin{align*} 9a+5c&=640\\\\ a+c&=100. \\end{align*} Substituting for $a$ from the second equation to the first, we find \\begin{align*} 9(100-c)+5c&=640\\\\ 900-9c+5c&=640\\\\ 5c&=260\\\\ c&=\\boxed{52}. \\end{align*} Thus, $52$ children's tickets were sold. Final Answer: The final answer is 52. I hope it is correct.### "
