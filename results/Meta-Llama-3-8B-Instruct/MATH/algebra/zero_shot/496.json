Then, we know that the domain of $f(x)$ will consist of all real numbers except $x=1$ and $x=2$.\n### Problem 2\nFor the domain of $f(x)$, we now think about the zeros in $f(x)$. If we consider the numerator, we know that $x$ must be greater than $1$ for the expression to be valid. For example, if $x=1$, the numerator becomes $\\sqrt{1-1}$, which is equal to $0$. Hence, the denominator of $f(x)$ is consisted of values for which $x$ is greater than 1.\n### Problem 3\nGoing back to the problem statement, we know that for integer values of $x$ which are greater than 1, we only need to consider one value, which is $x=\\boxed{3}$.

        " \nLet's look at the domain of f(x):\n$$f(x) = \\frac{\\sqrt{x-1}}{x-2}$$.\nIn order for this expression to have a real solution, the expression inside the square root must be greater than 0. This sets an inequality:\n$$x-1>0\\Rightarrow x>1.$$Furthermore, for a denominator to be nonzero, it must equal nonzero. Hence, we add $x > 1$ as well:\n$$x > 2.$$\nFinally, combining the restrictions, we can rewrite them as:\n$$x>2, x>1\\Rightarrow x>2$$.\nSo, the domain of f(x) is set to be open interval (2, inf).

        " First, our goal is to find a range for $x$ such that $f(x)$ is defined.\nFrom the formula of $f(x)$, $x-1$ must be greater than or equal to $0$, which means $x$ must be greater than 1. Also, $x-2$ must be non-zero, which means $x$ must be greater than 2.\nThis gives us the range for $x$: $\\boxed{2 < x}$.\n### Conclusion: Now that we know the range for $x$, let\u2019s think about when $f(x)$ is real valued. A function is real-valued if the radicand (the expression inside the square root) is non-negative. For $f(x)$, the radicand is $x-1$.\nFor $f(x)$ to be real-valued, $x-1 \\geq 0$, which means $x-1$ is equivalent to $x$ minus $1$, and is greater than or equal to $0$.\nThis means the smallest possible value for $x$ such that $f(x)$ is real-valued is $x = 1 + 1$, or $\\boxed{2}$.\n### Total time: The time needed to solve this problem is approximately 4-5 minutes.

        " Since $\\sqrt{x-1}$ cannot be negative, it must be that $x-1\\ge0$, or $x\\ge1$.  Now, if $x<2$, then $x-2<0$, which means that we can never square root anything.  However, if $x\\ge2$, then $x-2\\ge0$. Let $x=2$. When we plug that into the function, we have $\\frac{\\sqrt{2-1}}{2-2}=\\frac{0}{0}$, which is undefined. So, let\u2019s move on. Since both the numerator and the denominator have the same absolute value, but opposite signs, and we are taking the squared root of $x-1$, we must make sure that $x-1$ is greater than zero or equal to $0$. In other words, $x-1\\ge0$, which gives $x\\ge1$. Therefore, we can let $x=1$, but this will be undefined since $0/0$ equals undefined. Let\u2019s let $x=2$. We would say that this equals undefined as well. Finally, we will let $x=3$ and so on. After testing 2, we find that $x=4$ gives the first real number value.\nSo, the smallest possible integer value for $x$ such that $f(x)$ has a real number value is $\\boxed{4}$.

We will be using the factoring method here. \nWe can by putting factors together make it look like $(x+1)$ and $(x-2)$. So we have $(x+1)(x-2)$. So we can plug both of these back into the function and see which one gives $0$.\nNow we have $f(x) = (x+1)(x-2)$. Therefore, we have found two $x$-intercepts. So, we have the answer of $x=\\boxed{-1}$ and $x=\\boxed{2}$.\nFinal Answer:",
