        " It might be easier to denote each runner with an  alphabetical label and the number of miles they each ran as an unknown variable.  The problem says that the five runners together complete the $100$-mile endurance race. So we have the equation $a + b + c + d + e = 100$ . We know that $b = 1.5a$, $c + d = 2(a + b)$, and $e = 10$.  If we add the equation $c + d = 2(a + b)$ to the equation $a + b = c + d$, we get $c + d = a + b + c + d$. We can now substitute our known expressions in for c and d.  This gives us $2(a + b) = a + b + 2a + 3b$.  We can then simplify this to get $a = b$.  If we substitute this into our expression for $b$, we get $b = 1.5a$ $\\rightarrow$ $b = 1.5b$ $\\rightarrow$ $0.5b = b$ $\\rightarrow$ $\\boxed{b = 20}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 20.

        " How many miles did Runner B run?\nRunner B runs a distance that is 1.5 times the distance that Runner A runs, so if we call the distance that Runner A runs $x$, the distance that Runner B runs is $1.5x$.  Runner C and D run a distance that is twice as long as the combined distance of runners A and B.  The combined distance of runners A and B is $x+1.5x=2.5x$.

Then, the combined portion for Runners C and D will be $2((1.5x)+x)=6x$. So, the total length of the race that we know so far is $(1.5x)+x+6x$.

The part of the race assigned to Runners A and B equals $x$ miles.

The part of the race assigned to Runner B equals $1.5x$ miles.\n    - Since $7x$ and $x$ together make up $90$ miles, we know that $x=9$ miles, and so Runner B ran $\\boxed{1.5\\cdot9=\\13.5}$ miles.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 13.5.

        " Let\u2019s think step by step.\nSuppose Runner A\u2019s portion is $x$ miles.  Then Runner B\u2019s portion is $1.5x$ miles, since it is  $1.5$ times the length of Runner A\u2019s portion.  If the combined portion of Runners C and D is twice the length of the combined portion for Runners A and B, then it is $2(x+1.5x)=4x$ miles.  Suppose now that the total length of the race is $100$ miles.  Then we have that $x+1.5x+4x+10=100$, which gives $x=10$.

That part of the race is complete.  So, if $4x$ is 60, then $x$ is indeed 15.\nRunners A, B, C, D and E, in summary, ran the race accordingly.\nSo, concluding, the race was completed by Runners A, B, C, D, E. \nRunner A: 10 miles\nRunner B: 15 miles\nRunners C and D: 60 miles\nRunners E: 10 miles\nThe race is completed at 100 miles.\nThe final answer is 15 miles which is correct.
