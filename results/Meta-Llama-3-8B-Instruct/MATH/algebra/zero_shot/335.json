        "To simplify the expression \\(\\dfrac{\\sqrt{10}}{\\sqrt[4]{10}}\\), we start by rewriting both the numerator and the denominator using exponent notation.\n1.

Using the properties of exponents, specifically \\(\\dfrac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m-n}\\), we can simplify:\n   \\[\n   \\dfrac{10^{1/2}}{10^{1/4}} = 10^{1/2 - 1/4}\n   \\]\n4. Now we need to perform the subtraction in the exponent. First, we need a common denominator for the fractions \\(1/2\\) and \\(1/4\\). The common denominator is \\(4\\):\n   \\[\n   1/2 = \\dfrac{2}{4} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 1/4 = \\dfrac{1}{4}\n   \\]\n5.

Substitute back into the exponent:\n   \\[\n   10^{1/2 - 1/4} = 10^{1/4}\n   \\]\nThus, we have simplified the expression to:\n\\[\n\\dfrac{\\sqrt{10}}{\\sqrt[4]{10}} = 10^{1/4}\n\\]\nTherefore, the original expression \\(\\dfrac{\\sqrt{10}}{\\sqrt[4]{10}}\\) is equal to \\(10\\) raised to the power \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\).\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}\n\\]",

        " When we see a radical sign in mathematics, we should think about it as a power or an exponent. In this case, $\\sqrt{10} = 10^{1/2}$ is equal to 10 with an exponent 1/2, and $\\sqrt[4]{10} = 10^{1/4}$ is equal to 10 with an exponent 1/4.  So, $\\dfrac{\\sqrt{10}}{\\sqrt[4]{10}}$ can be written as \\begin{align*}\n\\dfrac{10^{1/2}}{10^{1/4}} &= 10^{1/2 - 1/4} \\\\\n&= 10^{1/4} \\\\\n&= \\boxed{10^{1/4}}\n\\end{align*}\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 1/4.

        " We can simplify the first part of the expression, as the square root of ten is ten raised to the half power, or $\\sqrt{10} = 10^{1/2}$.The second part of the expression, the fourth root of ten, or $\\sqrt[4]{10} = 10^{1/4}$.Now, we can substitute it with the above equation, that is: $$\\frac{\\sqrt{10}}{\\sqrt[4]{10}} = \\frac{10^{1/2}}{10^{1/4}}$$Now, let\u2019s use power of power rule which says that $a^{m} a^{n} = a^{m+n}$.
