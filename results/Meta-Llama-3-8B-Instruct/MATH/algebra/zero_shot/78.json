If I substitute y = 0 in the equation given, it becomes\n\\begin{align*}\n0 &= -4.9t^2 - 3.5t + 2.4 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow 2.4 &= -4.9t^2 - 3.5t \\\\\n\\Rightarrow 0 &= -4.9t^2 - 3.5t + 2.4.\n\\end{align*}\nThis quadratic equation represents a parabola that opens downward. Therefore, we expect to see only one real solution, which corresponds to the time when the ball hits the ground.\nThe given equation is already in the form $y = ax^2 + bx + c$, where $a = -4.9$, $b = -3.5$, and $c = 2.4$. Hence, we can solve it by using the standard quadratic formula:\n$$t = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}.$$\nSubstituting the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$, we obtain\n\\begin{align*}\nt &= \\frac{-(-3.5) \\pm \\sqrt{(-3.5)^2 - 4(-4.9)2.4}}{2(-4.9)} \\\\\n&= \\frac{3.5 \\pm \\sqrt{50.25 + 115.2}}{-9.8} \\\\\n&= \\frac{3.5 \\pm \\sqrt{165.45}}{-9.8} \\\\\n&= \\frac{3.5 \\pm 12.78}{-9.8} \\\\\n&= -0.30, \\quad \\mbox{or} \\quad \\boxed{-0.84}.\n\\end{align*}\nWe know that $t \\ge 0$.

        " \nLet\u2019s think step by step.\n1. We have $y = -4.9t^2 - 3.5t + 2.4$, so we set $y=0$ and solve for $t$. (This represents the time when the ball hits the ground.)\n$0 = -4.9t^2 - 3.5t + 2.4$\n2. Subtract 2.4 from both sides. This gives us:\n$-2.4 = -4.9t^2 - 3.5t$\n3. Now, multiply both sides by -1 so that we get the positive side of the equation as positive. This gives:\n$2.4 = 4.9t^2 + 3.5t$\n4. Add 0.25 to both sides, which simplifies the expression: \n$2.7 = 4.9t^2 + 3.5t + 0.25$\nNow, we have a quadratic equation in the form of $Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0$:\n$4.9t^2 + 3.5t + 0.25 = 0$\nWe will have to use the Quadratic Formula to solve for $t$:\n$t = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$\nA = 4.9\nB = 3.5\nC = 0.25\n$t = \\frac{-3.5 \\pm \\sqrt{(3.5)^2-4(4.9)(0.25)}}{2(4.9)}$\nSubtracting the numerator and denominator by 0.5:\n$t = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{3^2-4(4.9)(0.25-0.5)}}{2(4.9-1)}$\nContinue simplifying, you can find that:\n$t \\approx 0.41$ and $t \\approx 1.49$\nWe will consider only the positive value as it represents the real time when the ball hits the ground:\n$t \\approx 0.41$\nWe will round 0.41 to nearest hundredth. The answer is approximately $\\boxed{0.41 \\rightarrow 0.42}.$\nSo, the ball hits the ground in approximately 0.42 seconds. We can find the time in which the",

Enter: \u2018 \u2026calculate y=-4.9t^2-3.5t+2.4 when t =a\u2019. For a good starting guess: a=1.1. y=\u22124.9(1.1)^2-3.5(1.1)+2.4=\u22124.9(1.21)\u22123.85+2.4=\u22120.31.

The function in which we are interested, y, is a quadratic function : y=\u22124.9t^2-3.5t+2.4. It is known that the roots of the quadratic function $(\u22124.9)t^2\u22123.5t+2.4 are given by the formula : t=\\frac{-b\u00b1\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a} where a and c are coefficients of the function : t=\\frac{-b\u00b1\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\n### To find the roots of the quadratic function, use the signs. If the expression under the square root sign is positive, there are two real roots. If it is negative, there is no real root. If it is zero, there is one real root. The expression under the square root sign is the discriminant D, or \u0394, of the quadratic function. D = b ^{2} - 4ac. The roots are $\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}",
        " 1.53\nThe key thing here is that we are not checking the height. We are using the information given in the question: The ball will hit the ground when $y=0$. So, we simply need to set $y$ equal to zero and see when this happens. That is, we set $$0 = -4.9t^2 - 3.5t + 2.4.$$ This is a quadratic equation in $t$. We could use the quadratic formula to solve it, but since this is a problem about physics, a quick trick is to notice that $4.9$ and $3.5$ are roughly $5$ and $3.5$ respectively, which is close to but not equal to the rectangular roots $(5, 0)$ of the quadratic $-4.9t^2 - 3.5t$. In this case, the roots of the quadratic are $t = \\frac{3.5 \\pm \\sqrt{(-3.5)^2 - 4(4.9)(2.4)}}{2(4.9)}$, which equals $\\frac{3.5 \\pm \\sqrt{4.225 - 23.76}}{9.8}$. Similarly, $(2.4, 0)$ are the rectangular roots of the $y$ value, so the root to us is $\\frac{3.5 - \\sqrt{4.225 - 23.76}}{9.8} = \\frac{3.5 - 4.85}{9.8} = \\frac{-1.45}{9.8} = -0.1480783$. Thus, the solution of the equation must be negative. We can use our trick again, writing $0 = (4.9t + 3.5)^2 - 14.4$. Setting the left side equal to zero, we have $(4.9t + 3.5)^2 = 14.4$. From this, we can take the square root to obtain $4.9t + 3.5 = \\pm 3.75868$. Finally, we can subtract $3.5$ to obtain $4.9t = -0.04768$ to $2.30868$. The positive solution to this is the one which is positive. So, it is the one we will use. We can then divide both sides by $4.9$ to obtain $",

Plugging this into the equation, we obtain: $$0=4.9(t+0.4)^2-0.48=4.9(t+0.4)^2-0.48$$ Expanding this equation, we obtain:$$0=4.9t^2+4.9t+0.96-0.48=4.9t^2+4.9t+0.48$$Next, let\u2019s subtract 0.48 from both sides to isolate the right side.
