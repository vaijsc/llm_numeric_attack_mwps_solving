We can solve for $q$ or $p$.\nWe could try to solve for $q$ first, by subtracting $2q$ from both sides:\n$$3p+2q=34$$\n$$3p=34-2q$$\nSince we can't see an obvious way to factor the left hand side of this equation, let's instead solve for $p$. Adding $2q$ to both sides gives:\n$$3p=34-2q+2q$$\n$$3p=34$$\nNow we divide both sides by 3:\n$$p=\\frac{34}{3}$$\nNow that we know that $p=\\frac{34}{3}$, we can substitute this into the original equation, $2q+3p=34$. We get:\n$$2q+3\\left(\\frac{34}{3}\\right)=34$$\nNow we can solve for $q$:\n$$2q+34=34$$\n$$2q=0$$\n$$q=0$$\nSo we have found that $p=\\frac{34}{3}$ and $q=0$. Since we are asked for $p+q$, we simply add $p$ and $q$ to get:\n$$p+q=\\frac{34}{3}+0=\\frac{34}{3}$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\frac{34}{3}. I hope it is correct.

        " \nTaking the left-hand side, we have $(q+4)(p+3)-(q+2)(p+1)$. Now, by simplifying each expression inside the two parentheses, we have: $(qp+q+4p+12)-(qp+q+2p+2)$ Expand and combine like terms, we have $(4p+12)-(2p+2)=2p+10$ Now to get it a little simpler, multiply out the $2p$ like so: $2p+10=2p+2+8$ Combine the $2p$\u2019s: $2p+10=2p+2+8$ And finally, we can simplify it by combining like terms: $2p+10=8+2p$ And we\u2019re done! So, to start solving the original equation, we have: $(2p+10)=44$ To solve, multiply both sides by negative one (which won\u2019t change the fact that we are solving the same equation) so it will be easier to get $p$ on one side. By itself, we have $(2p+10)=-44$ To get p on one side, we multiply by $-1$ and we get: $-2p-10=-44$ Now multiply by $-1$ once more to have $p$ on one side: $2p+10=44$ This is where we started all over again. To get it to look like $2p=-34$, we subtract $10$ on one side and get: $2p=-44$ Finally, to solve for $p$, we can divide both sides by $2$ to find that $p=-22$ So far, so good! Now, to solve for $q$, we will work backwards in the original equation. Start by plugging in what we found for $p$: $(q+4)(-22+3)-(q+2)(-22+1)=44$ When simplifying the left-hand side with the new values for $p$, we will get: $(q+4)(-19)-(q+2)(-21)=44$ Simplify each side to get: $-19q-76+21q+42=44$ Add $19q$ and $76$ to both sides: $2q+26=44$ Finally, by subtracting 26 from both sides, we can find what we are looking for: $2q=",
        " To approach this problem, we use the distributive law $a(b+c)=ab+ac$ to expand the left side of the equation. $(q+4)(p+3)-(q+2)(p+1) = (q+4)p + (q+4)3-(q+2)p - (q+2)1 = (q+4)p + 3q+12-(q+2)p -q-2 = (4p+q)+12-(2p+q)-2 = 4p+q+12-2p-q-2 = \\boxed{2p+10}$. Now we are given that $44=2p+10$, which we can solve for $p$ using subtraction and division: \\begin{align*}\n44&=2p+10\\\\\n&=10+2p\n\\end{align*}By subtracting $10$ from both sides, we get $34=2p$, and dividing both sides by $2$, we obtain $p=\\boxed{17}$. Then, we substitute this into our original equation to find $q+4=(44+2p)-(p+2)=44+2\\cdot 17-(17+2)=44+34-19=\\boxed{59}$. So, $(q+4,p+3)=(59,20)$. Since we are looking for $p+q$, we actually want the $p+q$-coordinate of this point. Looking at the point, we have $\\boxed{p+q=59+17=76}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 76.

        " It would be easier to simplify the left hand side first. Then we can apply subtractions.

Subtract $2$ from both sides to get $$(p+3)(q+4)=44+2q$$ Apply subtractions on the right hand side like earlier to get $$(p+3)(q+4)=44+2q$$ $$=(p+3)(q+4) - (q+2)(p+1)+2q+2$$ Add $(q+2)(p+1)$ to both sides to get $$2q+2",

Notice that we have $u-v=6$ and $u+v=7$. One can solve this equation system to find that $u=6$ and $v=1$, which means $q=2$ and $p=-2$. In the same way, we can define $u=q+2$ and $v=p+1$, which gives us $uv-vu=44$ written as $uv-vu=44$. Then, we have $u+v=5$ and $u-v=2$. By solving this equation system, we obtain $u=3$ and $v=2$, which means $q=1$ and $p=0$. One can see that there are two sets of values for $q$ and $p$.
