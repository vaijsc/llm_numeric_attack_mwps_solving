        "We substitute x = -2 to find the value of f(-2).\nf(-2) = 5(-2)^2 + 3(-2) + 4\n### To evaluate f(-2), we can substitute x = -2.\nNote: It might be helpful to learn how to identify the $x$-coordinates of the vertex of the parabola $f(x)=ax^2+bx+c$ before attempting questions like this. Then, the question could be rephrased as what is the value of $f$ at the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of a parabola of that form. It is straightforward to find the parabola by applying a quadratic formula formula. We know that f(x)=a(x-h)^2+k, where h is the $x$-coordinate of the vertex, a is the leading coefficient, and k is the y value of the vertex. Matching coefficients with the equation f(x) = 5x^2 + 3x + 4, we have f(x) = 5(x-(-3/10))^2+9/4. Looking at the vertex, we have h = -3/10, and f(-3/10) = 9/4. So if we want to know if the point (0, 9/4) belongs to that parabola. Indeed it does, and also the point (-2, 9/4). The only difference between f(0) and f(-2) is the sign of x. What is the connection between this and the sign of the coefficient of the linear term in f(x). If I don't get the parts of the solution away, if the x intercepts are negative, then the sign of f(x) must be positive. The connection between this and what happens geoel=0 is more summarized.\n### Stay tuned & keep it up!

Looking forward to your recommendations. ###### Impact PGH, ### Reply LUCIANA LU PGH! Hi again!  I'm glad to help you improve your problem-solving skills.  Here are some tips and strategies that can help:\n1. **Practice consistently**: Regular practice helps to build your problem-solving skills.  You can find practice problems on various websites, such as Khan Academy, Brilliant, and MIT OpenCourseWare.\n2. **Develop a problem-solving routine**: Start by breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable parts.  Identify the problem type, read the prompt carefully, and identify any relevant formulas or concepts.\n3. **Use mental math and estimation**: When solving problems, try to use your mental math and estimation skills to simplify complex calculations.  This can help you identify patterns",

Why do you want me to use  $f(x)=5x^2+3x+4$ instead of using the evaluation rule $f(-2)=f(2x-4)$? I hope it reflects your expectation where you want the student to acknowledge that the given function is $f(x)$ and the problem asks about $f(-2)$. I will include the addition. My apologies for any confusion before. That will provide more clarity with the option. I hope it reflects your better expectation now. In the future, other questions may arise, it would be helpful to review this case here.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 18. I hope it is correct.
