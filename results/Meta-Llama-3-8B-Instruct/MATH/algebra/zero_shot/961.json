For $x$, we can write:\n$x^2 + 14x + a^2 = x^2 + 14x + 49 - 49 + a^2$\nBy replacing $a^2$ with $49$, we get:\n$(x+7)^2 = 49$\nWe will now substitute this expression into the equation.  We will replace $x^2 + 14x$ with $(x+7)^2 - 49$, and simplify:\n$(x+7)^2 - 49 + y^2 - 6y + 53 = 0$\nWe will use the same approach for $y$:\n$y^2 - 6y + b^2 = y^2 - 6y + 9 -",
        " We start by rearranging the equation to $x^2 + 14x + y^2 - 6y = -53.$ To get everything on one side, we add $53$ to both sides of the equation.
