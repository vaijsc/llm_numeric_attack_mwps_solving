Model development involves identifying the key variables, functions, and functional relationships among them, which are then used to generate a mathematical representation of the system. Mathematical modeling allows us to simulate the behavior of a system, predict the effects of changes in system parameters or processes, and derive quantitative laws that describe the system's behavior. In addition, mathematical modeling facilitates the communication of research findings to others and provides a framework for testing hypotheses about the system.",
