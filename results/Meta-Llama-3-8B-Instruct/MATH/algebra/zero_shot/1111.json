If we use a calculator to find f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right), we see that it is approximately 1. In particular, \\frac{\\pi}{3}<4, so f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) = \\lceil \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\rceil = 2. Next, we have f(\\sqrt{45}) = \\lfloor \\sqrt{45} \\rfloor = 7, and finally, f(8^{2/3}) = \\lfloor 8^{2/3} \\rfloor = \\lfloor 4 \\rfloor = 4. We can now find the sum: f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) + f(\\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 7 + 4 = \\boxed{13}. Therefore, f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) + f(\\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = \\boxed{13}. Final Answer: The final answer is 13. I hope it is correct.   \\boxed{13} Therefore, f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) + f(\\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = \\boxed{13}. Final Answer: The final answer is 13. I hope it is correct.1172views Problem 4: What is the value of x \u2026 [Read more]\n### ",
        " 3\nWe have $\\frac{\\pi}{3} < 4$, so we have $f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) = \\left\\lceil\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right\\rceil = 2$.   We have $\\sqrt{45} = 3\\sqrt{5} \\ge 4$, so we have $f(\\sqrt{45}) = \\lfloor\\sqrt{45}\\rfloor = 3$.  Finally we have $8^{2/3} = 8^{2/3} = 8 > 4$, so we have $f(8^{2/3}) = \\lfloor 8^{2/3}\\rfloor = 2$.  Hence the final answer is $f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) + f(\\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 3 + 2 = \\boxed{7}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 7.

        " \nLet\u2019s start by evaluating $f(\\sqrt{45}) = f(3\\sqrt{5})$ (by rationalizing the denominator $\\sqrt{5}$). We have that $\\sqrt{5} \\ge 4$, so $\\lfloor 3\\sqrt{5}\\rfloor = 3$. Then, $f(3\\sqrt{5}) = 3$. Next, we have that $\\pi \\approx 3.141$, so $2 < \\frac{\\pi}{3} < 3$. Then, $\\lceil \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\rceil = 2$ (because $2$ is not a perfect square but $2 < \\frac{\\pi}{3} < 3$). Moreover, $8^{2/3} = 8^{2/3}$, so $\\lceil 8^{2/3} \\rceil = 4$. Overall, we have that \\begin{align*}\nf\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) + f(\\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) &= 2 + 3 + 4 = \\boxed{9} .\n\\end{align*}\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 9. I hope it is correct.",
        " The function f(n) is defined by f(n)= \\lfloor n\\rfloor if n is 4 or greater; \\lceil n\\rceil if n is strictly less than 4. That tells us that f(8^{2/3}) will be f(2), which is 2. So we are now left with f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)+f(\\sqrt{45})+2. The \\sqrt{45} is equal to 3\\sqrt{5}. Since 3\\sqrt{5} is strictly less than 4, we know that f(\\sqrt{45}) is \\lceil 3\\sqrt{5}\\rceil, which is 4. So f(3\\sqrt{5})=4. We are left with f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)+4+2, which is f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)+6. This leaves us with the problem of evaluating f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right). It is easy to show that f(x)=\\lfloor x\\rfloor. But now we have to decide whether \\frac{\\pi}{3} is strictly greater than or equal to 4. We know that \\pi\\approx 3.14, so we see that \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\approx\\frac{3.14}{3}\\approx1.04, which is strictly less than 4. Therefore, we know that f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)=\\lceil \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\rceil=2. Thus f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)+6=2+6=8, which is the final answer.\n### Answer: 8. Therefore, we get $f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) + f(\\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) + 4 + 2 = \\boxed{8}$.\n### Final Answer: The final answer is 8.
