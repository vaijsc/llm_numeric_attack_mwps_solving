        "To find the distance between the two intersections of the curves \\( y = x^2 \\) and \\( x + y = 1 \\), we will first substitute \\( y \\) from the second equation into the first equation to find the points of intersection.\n1.

        " Since $y=x^2$, we have $x^2+y=1$. Therefore, $$x^2+x=0$$ is a quadratic equation in $x$. Here its discriminant is $(-1)^2-4(1)(0)=1$. Thus, there is one real solution to the quadratic equation, which is $x=\\frac{-1}{2}$. Since $y=x^2$, we have $y=\\frac{1}{4}$. Therefore, we have found an intersection point $(\\frac{-1}{2},\\frac{1}{4}).$\nNext, we should consider the equation $y=x^2$ and $x+y=1$ simultaneously. That is, $x^2+y=1$ is equivalent with $x^2+x-y=0$. The discriminant of this equation is $$1-4xy=1-4(\\frac{1}{4})=0.$$ Hence, we have found another intersection point, namely $(0,1)$.\nNow, the distance between two intersection points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ is given by $\\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2}$. We have found that $(x_1,y_1)=(0,1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)=(-\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{4})$.

Because $x=-1,\\ y=1-(-1)=2$, and $x=1,\\ y=1-1=0$, we know that the $y$-coordinates of the intersections are 2 and 0.",
        " First find one intersection, then find another intersection, then find the distance between the two intersections.",
        " In order to find the intersections, we need to solve $x^2+x=1$ (just set $x+y=1$ and substitute for $y$) to get two different solutions for $x$, namely $x_1=\\frac{-1+\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and $x_2=\\frac{-1-\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ (remember that the sum of the square roots of any of the roots and their respective roots is 0).  Substituting back to find the corresponding $y$\u2019s, we get \\begin{align*}\ny_1&=\\frac{-1+\\sqrt{3}}{2}^2=\\frac{-1}{2}+\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\\\\ny_2&=\\frac{-1-\\sqrt{3}}{2}^2=\\frac{-1}{2}-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\n\\end{align*}The distance between the two intersections is therefore $\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{-1-\\sqrt{3}}{2}-\\frac{-1+\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)^2+\\left(\\frac{-1}{2}-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}-\\frac{-1}{2}+\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)^2}$ $=\\boxed{\\sqrt{2}}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\sqrt{2}. I hope it is correct. "
