        " \nOne important thing to note here is that each of the terms in the sum has the same value, namely 4^5.

We can rewrite this as 0^3+6=6, so our final answer is $\\boxed{2}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2. I hope it is correct. Next line, write if you want more information.

        " \nWe have that $\\sqrt[3]{4^5 + 4^5 + 4^5 + 4^5} = \\sqrt[3]{4(4^4)} = \\sqrt[3]{4^5} = \\boxed{4}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 4. I hope it is correct. Printable Answer: If you wish to get a printable version of this question, you can use the following syntax.\n```latex\n\\documentclass{article}\n\\begin{document}\nWhat is the value of $\\sqrt[3]{4^5 + 4^5 + 4^5 + 4^5}$?\nLet\u2019s think step by step.\n### ",
        " \nLet\u2019s start by evaluating the expression using the given information: 4^5 means 4 to the power of 5, which is 1024. We then have $$\\sqrt[3]{4^5+4^5+4^5+4^5}=\\sqrt[3]{1024+1024+1024+1024}$$Next, we combine the four terms under the square root, since they are all equal:\n$$\\sqrt[3]{1024+1024+1024+1024}=\\sqrt[3]{4096}$$Finally, since 4^3 is equal to 64, we know that 4^5 divided by 4^3 is equal to 4^2.  Hence, we can write $$\\sqrt[3]{4096}=\\sqrt[3]{4^2\\times 4^3}=\\sqrt[3]{4^5}=4$$Thus, the value of $\\sqrt[3]{4^5+4^5+4^5+4^5}$ is 4.\n(The following information is DETAILED SOLUTION, you can skip it.)\nLet\u2019s start by writing down the given expression using the exponent rules:\n$$\\sqrt[3]{4^5 + 4^5 + 4^5 + 4^5} = \\sqrt[3]{4^5 \\times 1^3 + 4^5 \\times 1^3 + 4^5 \\times 1^3 + 4^5 \\times 1^3} = \\sqrt[3]{4^5 \\times (1^3 + 1^3 + 1^3 + 1^3)}$$Next, let\u2019s use the distributive property to expand the expression under the square root:\n$$\\sqrt[3]{4^5 \\times (1^3 + 1^3 + 1^3 + 1^3)} = \\sqrt[3]{4^5 \\times (1 + 1 + 1 + 1)}$$Finally, we simplify this expression by combining the terms in parentheses:\n$$\\sqrt[3]{4^5 \\times (1 + 1 + 1 + 1)} = \\sqrt[3]{4^5 \\times 4} = \\sqrt[3]{4 \\times 4 \\times 4 \\times 4 \\times 4} = 4$$\n",
        " \nWe notice that $4 = 2^2$.\nTherefore, $4^5 = (2^2)^5 = 2^{10}$.\nSo, our expression becomes\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sqrt[3]{4^5 + 4^5 + 4^5 + 4^5} &= \\sqrt[3]{2^{10} + 2^{10} + 2^{10} + 2^{10}} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt[3]{2^{10} \\cdot 4} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt[3]{2^2 \\cdot 2^{10}} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt[3]{2^{12}} \\\\\n&= 2^4 \\quad \\text{since } \\sqrt[3]{a^b} = a^{b/3} \\\\\n&= \\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\nNext Steps: It looks like your instructor is interested in the Algebra Final Examination.
