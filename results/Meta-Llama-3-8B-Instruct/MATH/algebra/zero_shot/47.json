        " The steps\nSo, we have to simplify the expression $(2-2i)(5+5i)$. The approach is to FOIL it ( multiplicating the terms in each parenthesis):\n\\begin{align*}\n(2-2i)(5+5i) &= (2)(5) + (2)(5i) - (2)(5i) - (2i)(5i) & \\text{distribution}\\\\\n&= 10+10i-10i+10i^2 \\\\\n&= 10+(10i-10i)+10i^2 \\\\\n&= 10+10(i^2) \\\\\n&= 10+10(-1) \\\\\n&= \\boxed{-10}\n\\end{align*}And thus we have the answer.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -10. I hope it is correct. ### Result: We have that $$(2-2i)(5+5i)=\\boxed{-10}.$$\n### Remark: Here\u2019s a conceptual remark. The result is easy to guess by thinking of $2-2i$ as a complex number with magnitude $2i=2\\sqrt{2}$ and the number $5+5i$ as a complex number with magnitude $5i=5\\sqrt{2}$. Then, we can imagine that $(2-2i)(5+5i)$ is the area of a rectangle with sides $2i$ and $5i$, which is $2i\\cdot 5i=10i^2=10(-1)=-10.$ The same technique can be used to evaluate other simple expressions involving complex numbers. This is called \"geometry of the complex plane\" and is useful in many applications, including electrical engineering and signal processing. Thanks for your attention! ### Tip: Here are some other formulas that are useful when working with complex numbers: $(a+bi)(c+di)=ac-bd+i(ad+bc)$ $(a+bi)^{-1}=\\frac{a}{a^2+b^2}-\\frac{b}{a^2+b^2}i$ $(a+bi)^n=a^n+(nb)a^{n-1}b+\\frac{(n)(n-1)}{2!}a^{n-2}b^2+\\cdots+b^n$ $(a+bi)(c+di)=(a+c)+(b+d)i$ $a(1+bi)^n=a(1",
        " \nUsing $(a+b)(c+d)=ac+ad+bc+bd$, we have\n$$(2-2i)(5+5i)=2(5+5i)-2i(5+5i)=10+10i-10i-10i^2=10+10i-10i+10=\\boxed{20}.$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 20.

The correct formula is\n$$(a+bi)(",
        " Begin by expanding $(2-2i)(5+5i)$.  We can do this by multiplying the real and imaginary parts in each factor and then combining them.  To do the multiplication, we multiply the real numbers with the real numbers and the imaginary numbers with the imaginary numbers. Therefore, the real parts multiply each other, and the imaginary parts multiply each other.  $$\\begin{split}(2-2i)(5+5i)&=(2)(5)+(2)(5i)-((2)(5)i)+((-2)(i))(5i)\\\\&=10+10i-10i-10i^2\\\\&=10+0-10i^2.\\end{split}$$ Now we substitute $i^2=-1$ into our expression.\n### ",
        " \nNotice that in the factored expressions, the quaternions are written in standard form $a+bi.$ Thus, if we adopt such a form, we would have\n$$(2-2i)(5+5i) = (2+0i)(5+5i) = 2 + 0i.$$But we have a bigger goal, in which we are trying to make the terms as transparent as possible (without any coefficients in the imaginary unit).\nSo, we continue with the calculation using FU-PE (FOIL the UNities and Product Equivalents). That is,\n\\begin{align*}\n(2 - 2i)(5 + 5i) &= (2)(5) + (2)(5)i - (2)(5)i - (2)(5)i^2 \\\\\n&= 10 + (5-5)i - 10i^2\\\\\n&= 10 + (5 - 5)i + 10\\\\\n&= 20 + 0i\\\\\n&= \\boxed{20}.\n\\end{align*}I hope you enjoyed it on your own. But if not, my solution won\u2019t bother you.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 20. I hope it is correct. Let me know if you need any more help. Remember that FOIL is always your best friend.
