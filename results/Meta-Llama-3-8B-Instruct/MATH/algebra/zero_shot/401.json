        "To solve the inequality \\( |x + 4| < 9 \\), we start by rewriting the absolute value inequality into a double inequality. The expression \\( |x + 4| < 9 \\) means that the expression \\( x + 4 \\) must be between \\(-9\\) and \\(9\\). Mathematically, we can express this as:\n\\[\n-9 < x + 4 < 9\n\\]\nNext, we can solve the two inequalities separately.\n1. Solve the left part of the double inequality:\n   \\[\n   -9 < x + 4\n   \\]\n   To isolate \\(x\\), we subtract \\(4\\) from both sides:\n   \\[\n   -9 - 4 < x \\implies -13 < x \\implies x > -13\n   \\]\n2. Solve the right part of the double inequality:\n   \\[\n   x + 4 < 9\n   \\]\n   Again, subtract \\(4\\) from both sides:\n   \\[\n   x < 9 - 4 \\implies x < 5\n   \\]\nNow we have the combined inequality:\n\\[\n-13 < x < 5\n\\]\nNext, we will determine the integers that satisfy this inequality. The integers in this interval are those that are greater than \\(-13\\) and less than \\(5\\). We list the integers:\n\\[\n-12, -11, -10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\n\\]\nNow we count the integers: \n- The first integer greater than \\(-13\\) is \\(-12\\).\n- The last integer less than \\(5\\) is \\(4\\).\nTo count the total number of integers, we proceed as follows:\n- The set of integers from \\(-12\\) to \\(4\\) can be counted using the formula for the count of integers in an inclusive range, which is given by:\n\\[\n\\text{count} = (\\text{last integer} - \\text{first integer}) + 1\n\\]\nHere, the last integer is \\(4\\) and the first integer is \\(-12\\):\n\\[\n\\text{count} = (4 - (-12)) + 1 = (4 + 12) + 1 = 16 + 1 = 17\n\\]\nThus, the total number of integers that satisfy the inequality \\( |x + 4| < 9 \\) is \n\\[\n\\boxed{17}\n\\]",
        "To solve the inequality \\( |x + 4| < 9 \\), we can first rewrite it in terms of a double inequality.\nThe expression \\( |x + 4| < 9 \\) means that the value of \\( x + 4 \\) is less than 9 units away from 0.

The language used is easy to understand, and the author avoids using complex jargon or technical terms. However, the passage assumes that the reader has a basic understanding of algebra and inequalities, but this is a common assumption in education and real-life situations.

        " 13\nWe are asked to find all the integers that satisfy the given inequality. The problem is reduced to solving $|x+4| < 9$. We are solving this because we want to solve for all integers.\nWe have two possibilities for $x+4$, either it\u2019s positive or negative.\nWhen $x+4$ is positive, we have $\\boxed{9 > x+4 \\ge 0}$ which gives us $\\boxed{x > -4}$ with $-3 \\le x \\le 4$. This means that the integers that satisfy this case are $-3$, $0$, $1$, $2$, $3$, and $4$.\nWhen $x+4$ is negative, we have $\\boxed{9 > -(x+4) \\ge 0}$ which gives us $\\boxed{-9 > x+4}$ with $-9 \\ge x \\ge -5$. This means that the integers that satisfy this case are $-9$, $-8$, $-7$, $-6$, and $-5$.\nNow, we need to combine the results from both cases. From the first case, we have $-3$, $0$, $1$, $2$, $3$, and $4$. From the second case, we have $-9$, $-8$, $-7$, $-6$, and $-5$.\nCombining the results, we get $-9$, $-8$, $-7$, $-6$, $-5$, $-3$, $0$, $1$, $2$, $3$, and $4$. These are the integers that satisfy the inequality. There are $\\boxed{13}$ integers. Lastly, we can solve this inequality graphically.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 13. I hope it is correct. (Wait for a confirmation). The solution is correct. The graphical solution consists of drawing an absolute value function with the function shifted to the left by 4 units. The y-value 9 is shown on both sides of the function. We can see that the region between the two points (-5, 5) and (3, 5) contains integers as required by the problem. Therefore, there are 13 integers that satisfy this inequality, which is $-9$, $-8$, $-7$, $-6$, $-5$, $-3$, $0$, $1$, $2$, $3$, and $4",

        " \n recall that the absolute value of a number x gives the larger of x and -x. Also, the absolute value of x is less than some number a if and only if the inequalities \\begin{align*}x - a& > 0\\ \\Rightarrow x > a\\\\-x - a&>0\\ \\Rightarrow -x > a\\end{align*}are true. From $|x + 4|< 9$, we get two inequalities: \\begin{align*}x+4&<9\\ \\Rightarrow x-4 >0\\ \\Rightarrow x>-4\\\\\\ -(x+4)&<9\\ \\Rightarrow -x-4>0\\ \\Rightarrow- x > 4.\\end{align*}Equivalently, these inequalities can be expressed as: \\begin{align*}x&>-4\\\\-x&>4.\\end{align*}From the system of these two inequalities we can immediately conclude that $x>-4$, because we want to find out how many integers are in the solution, hence we only take positive $x$. Then the solution set consists of all integers such that $-4 < x \\le 4$, hence the number of integers which satisfy the problem inequality is given by $|4-(-4)+1|=\\boxed{6}$.From these inequalities we can easily see that the solution set consists of all integers such that $-4 < x \\le 4$. Hence the number of integers which satisfy the problem inequality is given by $|4-(-4)+1|=\\boxed{6}$.So the solution set consists of all integers such that $-4 < x \\le 4$, hence the number of integers which satisfy the problem inequality is given by $|4-(-4)+1|=\\boxed{6}$. Since it consists of 6 integers we pick all. That is, $x = -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4$. We are left with $-4 < x \\le 4$. The only integers are $x = -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3$. We are done.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 6. I hope it is correct.Each integer from -3 to 3 satisfies $-4 < x \\le 4$ since both inequalities are true.\nFinal Answer: The final answer",
        " Since the inequality |x+4| < 9 is equivalent to -9 < x + 4 < 9. Thus, -9 - 4 < x < 9 - 4, which gives -13 < x < 5. This means that there are 18 integers in the solution of the inequality. Final Answer: The final answer is 18. I hope it is correct.  ",
        " We can use the definition of the absolute value function |x| = x if x \u2265 0 and |x| = -x if x < 0. In this case, the given inequality is x + 4 < 9, so x < 5. However, since there are negative integers for x, the solution set can be extended to include all integers with x \u2264 -1. In the solution set, we count all integers from -9 to 4 as following: -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4.\nCounting how many integers there are in the solution set, we see that there are $\\boxed{12}$ integers in total.\n### Alternative Method: In this alternative method, we are going to draw the graph of the inequality, then the whole problem becomes much simpler.\nThe graph is shown below: From the graph, it is clear that the integers that satisfy the given inequality are -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.
