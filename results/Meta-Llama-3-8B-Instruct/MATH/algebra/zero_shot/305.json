Factoring, we get $(a-b)(a+b)=99$.\nSince the two perfect squares have two other perfect squares between them, we know that $a-b=3$. Therefore, $a+b=33$. Adding the two equations together, we get $2a=36$. Therefore, $a=18$ and $b=15$. Thus, the sum of the two perfect squares is $a^2+b^2=324+225=\\boxed{549}$.",

        " Since the difference between two perfect squares is a perfect square, we will get a quadratic with a perfect square as the discriminant.  So, $(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$. Therefore $ab = 25$. We consider the pairs $(1, 25)$, $(25, 1)$, $(5, 5)$. The squares ending with 5 cannot be in an ordered pair because each square needs to end with 0 or 1. Now, let\u2019s try the ordered pairs $(1, 25)$ and $(25, 1)$.\n###  ",

The roots of the equation are $x=11$ and $x=-3$, and we know that $x = 11$ because $11^2 - 11^2 - 10^2 = 99$.  We also know that the equation $(x+10)^2 - x^2 = 99$ has roots $x=9$, $x=6$ and $x=-3$.  We know that there are only two other perfect squares between them, therefore the squares of these roots are $36$ and $100$.  Therefore, the sum is $36+100=\\boxed{185}$.### Model-3\nLet us denote the two squares",

        " Her favourite number 99. So let  x be a perfect square. $x(x-99)$ will be the difference between two perfect squares. So $x(x-99)$ is 99.  Simply factoring, $x^2-99x=0$.  x^2-99x=x(x-99)=x which will be 0.  This is a product of two terms, and we know that if one term is zero, then the product will also be zero.  So let x be 0, we have  x(x-99).  But x also cannot be 1.  So we can see that x+99 = 0.  But x cannot be -99.  So x -99 =0, solving for x, we get 11 and 9.\nSo 11 and 9 are the solutions for this.  We know that (11)(9)=99, because it is the difference between the perfect squares.  Now the sum of the perfect squares written on the blackboard are 11^2 and 9^2.  11^2 is (11)(11)=121.  9^2 is (9)(9)=81.  The sum of the perfect squares on the blackboard are 121+81.  Thus, we can see that the sum of the two perfect squares on the blackboard are **202**.  Thank you for watching or reading.  If you have questions, please let me know.

        " Let\u2019s call the two perfect squares on the blackboard $x$ and $y$.  We know that their difference is 99, so $$y-x=99.$$We can also make a table of some perfect squares and order them. $\\begin{array}{|c|c|} \\hline \\text{Perfect Square} & \\text{Value} \\\\ \\hline 1^2 & 1 \\\\ 2^2 & 4 \\\\ 3^2 & 9 \\\\ 4^2 & 16 \\\\ 5^2 & 25 \\\\ 6^2 & 36 \\\\ 7^2 & 49 \\\\ 8^2 & 64 \\\\ 9^2 & 81 \\\\ 10^2 & 100 \\\\ \\hline \\end{array}$By looking at the table, we can see that the perfect square preceding 81 and the perfect square following 81 both have a difference of 99 with 81.

        " Below is the answer:\nThe perfect squares that differ by 99 must have the form $x^2$ and $(x+9)^2$ for some positive integer $x$.  To make sure that $(x+9)^2-x^2=99$, we need to solve the equation $x^2+18x+81-9x-9=99$.  This reduces to $9x=9$, so $x=1$, and $(x+9)^2=10^2$.

        " Let $x$ and $y$ denote the two perfect squares. We have:\n\\begin{align*}\nx-y&=99\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x&=y+99\n\\end{align*}\nSince $y$ is a perfect square, we must have $y=n^2$ for some integer $n$.  Thus, $x=y+99=n^2+99=(n+9)^2-72$.  Note that $n$ must be even (so that the terms $n+9$ and $n^2$ are perfect squares), and hence $n=\\pm8$.  We reject $n=-8$ since $-72$ is negative, and $(n+9)^2-72$ is then an odd number larger than 99, so it cannot be equal to $x$.  This means $n=8$, and so the perfect squares on the blackboard are $y=64$ and $x=(n+9)^2=73^2$.  The sum of these numbers is $\\boxed{73^2+64=2809}$.\n# (1) Set up the equation: $x-y=99$, and also the other perfect squares between them.\n# (2) Use $x=y+99$ and perfect square and make n odd.\n# (3) x+y= 8^2+99+9^2= 8^2+10^2.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2809.
