        " The answer to this question would be 50.\nHere\u2019s why:\nWe are given the equation $5+x=110y$ where $x$ is $500\\%$ of $10$ and $y$ is a single number. To begin, we need to find what $500\\%$ of $10$ is. To do this, we must multiply $10$ by 5. In other words, we can write $500\\%=5=5\\times 100=10\\times 50$. Now we can plug in $x=50$ back into the equation $5+x=110y$. We obtain $5+50=110y$. We can distribute the $110$ and simplify to get $55=110y$. Then, we divide both sides by $110$ to solve for $y$. In other words, $y=\\frac{55}{110}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$. We can\u2019t give $y$ as a decimal because of whole number simplicity. Thus, we can round $\\frac{1}{2}$ to $50$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 50. I hope it is correct.`, five plus `500%` of 10` is equivalent to `110%` of what number?)",
        " $\\boxed{25}$\nWe want to see which number, when increased by $500\\%$, results in the same increase when increased by $110\\%$.  If we take a general number $x$, the first expression would look like $x + .5x = 1.5x$, and the second is $1.1y$.  In order for this to be the same, we would need $1.5x=1.1y$.  Solving for $y$, this becomes $x = \\frac{1.1y}{1.5}$.  Since we are not given any information about the two numbers except that they increase by the same amount, we don\u2019t know what number to choose.  Therefore, we would choose a number that is easy to work with, like $5$.  In the case that $x=5$, we would need $$1.5(5)=1.1y \\Rightarrow y=\\boxed{25}$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 25.

VIEW MORE\nWhat if we are asked the same instruction but for some random number instead of 10?\nThen the instruction would be: \u201cFive plus $500\\%$ of $x$ is the same as $110\\%$ of what number?\u201d\nFrom my study, I know that to convert percentage to a decimal, I need to divide by 100. $500\\% = \\frac{500}{100} = 5$ and $110\\% = \\frac{110}{100} = 1.1$. Then $5 + 500\\% of x$ becomes $5 + 5x$. Now I need to find a number $y$ such that $5 + 5x$ is the same as $1.1y$.\nTo make both expressions equal to each other, the values in the expressions must be equal. So $$5 + 5x = 1.1y$$ which is true only if $x$ and $y$ satisfy this equation.\nIf $x = 10$, then $y$ would be $11$. But there might be other solution as well. So the instruction could be maximized to find all these solutions.\nOverall, we could infer that the instruction would not be limited to any specific number other than it cannot equal $0$. Then, the solution is to simplify the instruction by eliminating the \u201c$x$\u201d which makes the instruction the same as the one I solved initially (Five plus $500\\%$ of $10$ is the same as 110% of what number?).',\ninformed.

        " We need to evaluate the given expressions. Five is the same as $5$ dollars. One hundred percent of $5$ is $5$ dollars, so we can say that 5 = 100% x = ???, or 5 = (.01)x, or x = 500. Now, five plus 500 percent of 10. We can write this as 5 + 500 = 100% o = 10 (100% of 10 means $10). Then, we have 5 + 500% x 10 = 5 + 50. Therefore, we have 5 + 50 = 55. On the other hand, 110% of what number? This means we need to multiply 110% times the unknown number, and this result should be 55. So, let\u2019s write 1.1 x \u2014\u2014 = 55, and divide both sides by 1.1. We have \u2014\u2014 = 55/1.1 = 50. Therefore, 55 is 110% of 50. Alternative solution, we can write five plus 500 percent of 10 as 5 + 50 = 55. The same as 110 percent of x. Then, we have 1.1 x = 55, and divide both sides by 1.1. The unknown number is 50.",

The expression \u201cFive plus $500\\%$ of $10$\u201d means that we add 5 to the result of multiplying $10$ by $500\\%$ which means $500\\%$ of $10=500\\%\\times10=5\\times10=50$, so we have $5+50=55$.  On the other hand \u201c$110\\%$ of what number\u201d also means $110\\%$ of that number which is the result of multiplying that number by $110\\%$ and we are asked to find that number.  Thus the question is \u201cwhat number multiplied by $110\\%$ equals $55$?\u201d  We could solve that with algebra, or we could say we should multiply $55$ by $\\frac{100\\%}{110\\%}=\\frac{10}{11}$ to get that number, which equals $\\dfrac{55\\times10}{11}=\\dfrac{550}{11}=50$ divided by $\\dfrac{10}{11}=\\boxed{22}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 22.

        " First, 500% of 10 = $500/100\\times10$ = 5\\cdot10= 50;\nSecond, if 5+50 is the same as 110% of a certain number, then 5+50 $(=55)$ = $110/100\\times$ that number (implied that the number is x). That is, 55 = (11/10)x.\nWe can solve the equation:\n$$55=\\frac{11x}{10} \\Rightarrow10\\cdot55=11x \\Rightarrow x=\\boxed{55}.$$\nThe correct solution is thus: there is three-person committee and any three person (it's just a small change)\u2026I find that it [the proper solution] was missing.\nAs a result, I have lost confidence in Goldstein and Rodriguez [2013].\nNeedless to say that it has once again brought me to question the selection process for the book\u2019s content. The authors may not be experts in mathematics, after all.\nWhen I finish this project, I would like to verify with the peer-reviewed article Goldstein [2013] about the relevant proof. On this occasion, I thank user72 of MSE for mentioning this issue.\nI am sorry if my talking too much is boring. Now, I have other question and concern; my other question is that MR is not too difficult. Moreover, I am a undergraduate student, so almost of this work done by me have been quite easy. SR\u2019s approach is to prove by analogy by turning the result into equation with the given information and solve it. So, the book [The Art of Problem Solving] has never expected me like this. My another point of view is that the book didn\u2019t make me learn to use steps anymore; they only want you to use intuition, to make the connection of some aspects of a problem.\nAs you can see, they were include sum/difference trig identity, SOHCAHTOA, and parametric/symetric equation. It looks [like or should I say model?] like just a language used in mathamonics. Finally, I think another book which has more substance, so I would recommend Best Abstract Algebra book [West] for someone, who doesn\u2019t want to be met problem without substance.\nsource;\nlink text\nAnother book, I also say books recommended system, which is a brief - free- guide or real guide for math performance.\nsource;\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 55.

        " You do not need to compute explicitly with the percents, but you do need to remember the definition of a percent. So we will first translate the given information into a mathematical equation. We can represent $5$ as $\\frac{1}{20}$; percents can be read as a fraction with denominator 100. Then, apply a sum. We also substitute $110$ for $1.1$ (without units). Next, change the percent to a decimal by dividing the numerator by $100$. And also substitute $10$ in the f.s. We can multiply decimals by adding the same number of zeros. So we will do it here. Finally we can change that result to $\\frac{1}{10}$ to get the equivalent decimal.\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{20}+500\\%\\times10&=1.1x\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\quad\\frac{1}{20}+50&=1.1x\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\quad\\frac{1}{10}+50&=1.1x\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\quad 50+\\frac{1}{10}&=1.1x\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad \\quad 51&=1.1x\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad\\qquad\\; x&=\\boxed{46.67}\n\\end{align*}\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 46.67.
