The only pairs of factors of $17$ are $(17,1)$ and $(-17,-1)$. Thus we have that the coordinates satisfy one of the following four systems: (i) $x+y=17$, $x-y=1$; (ii)  $x+y=-17$, $x-y=-1$; (iii) $x+y=1$, $x-y=17$; (iv) $x+y=-1$, $x-y=-17$.

Since the product of two numbers is 17, they are either both positive or both negative. That is, $a^2-b^2=17$ implies that either $a$ and $b$ are both even or both odd.

One possible solution is $c=3$, $d=1$, since $3^2-1^2=\\frac{17}{4}$. (There are other possibilities.) If both are odd; WLOG, $a=2c+1$ and $b=2d+1$.

Thus, $$x^2-y^2=xy|x+y|-17=-17.$$We conclude that $x$ and $y$ must be even.  If $xy$ were negative, then both $x$ and $y$ would be negative, contradicting $x-y>0$.

        " This is a \"diophantine\" problem, where we need to find all integer solutions to a given equation. In this case, the Diophantine equation is\n$$x^2-y^2=17.$$We recall a special identity: for integers $x,$ $y$, and $z,$ the equation $x^2-y^2=z$ is equivalent to $(x+y)(x-y)=z$.So, if $z=17$, then we must have\n$$xy=8.5,$$where $x$ and $y$ are both integers. Since $x$ and $y$ are integers, we must have $x$ and $y$ are divisors of $8.5$. However, we also know that $xy=8.5$, so if one of $x$ or $y$ is greater than $1$, we can compute the value of the other one, and find that it is not an integer.\nThus, the only way for the product $xy$ to be $8.5$ is for one of $x$ or $y$ to be $1$ and the other to be $8.5$ (which is not an integer).

        " Let\u2019s graph the hyperbola in the $xy$-plane.  As $x$ increases, $y$ decreases from positive to negative.  To find the lattice points on the hyperbola, we can divide the number of lattice points on the upper-left quarter of the hyperbola by $4$, since the lattice points on the other three quarters are mere reflections of those in the upper-left quarter.  For upper-left quarter: \\begin{align*}\nx&\\ge 0,\\\\\ny&\\ge0,\\\\\nx^2-y^2&=17.\n\\end{align*}\nMultiplying both sides of the inequality above by $x^2$ (without passing the equal sign), we get $$x^4 - y^2x^2 = 17x^2.$$Rearranging the terms, we have $$(x^2)^2 - (y^2x^2)^1 = 17x^2.$$Letting $a=x^2$ and $b=yx$, we can simplify the above equation further into \\begin{align*}\na^2-b^2&=17a,\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad (a+7b)(a-7b)&=0,\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad a+7b&=0,\\quad\\text{or}\\quad a-7b=0.\n\\end{align*}Note that we cannot have $a+7b=0$ since it would imply that $x^2+yx$ is a nonpositive number.  Therefore, we must have $$x^2-7xy=0.$$Factoring $y$, we obtain\\begin{align*}\nx(x-7y)&=0,\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x&=0,\\quad\\text{or}\\quad x=7y.\n\\end{align*}Since $x\\ge0$, we must have $x=7y$ for some positive integer $y$.\n$y$ can be as small as $1$.  In this case, we have $x=y=1$, which is a lattice point on the hyperbola.\nAs $y$ increases, the smallest positive integer that allows for $x$ to be an integer is $y=2$, which gives $x=14$.  The next possible value of $y$ is $y=3$, which gives $x=21$.",
        " Let us look at some examples.\ne.g. $x^2-4=17$ is not possible ($x=+3$, $x=-3$) , but $x^2-3=17$ is ($x=4$, $x=-4$). Hence, $y^2$ values must be positive\nLet us start with a very small $y$ value, e.g., $y=1$. Now $x^2 -1^2 =17$, so $x^2 = 18$ and therefore, $x= \\pm \\sqrt{18} = \\pm 3\\sqrt{2}$.$x$ are not integers, so they are not lattice points.$y=2$ does not give a solution, because then $x^2-4=17$ is not possible.$y=3$ gives the lattice point $(4,3)$ .\nThe next set of $y$ values will be $y=4, y=5, \\cdots$. So, the lattice points that we have found so far are $(4,3), (4, -3)$.\nNow let us try $y=6$ and afterwards. With $y=6$, we have that $x^2-6^2=17$, so $x^2=49$ and therefore $x= \\pm 7$.\nFrom here on out, let us switch to a more systematic approach: we can express $x^2 - y^2 = 17$ as $(x-y)(x+y)=17$. Note that there are either 3 factorizations or 1 factorization in $(x-y)(x+y)$, but the difference of the differences between factors can never be 0, otherwise the $x$-value would be a multiple of 3, and there are no other factorizations.\n(Hint: This means that we have 2 options- $x-y$ can be 1 or -1)\nThen we equate in both cases $(x-y)(x+y)$: In the first case, we have $(x-1)(x+1)=17$ so that $x=6,8,9$ In the second case, we have $-(x+1)(x-1)=-17$, so $x=-18,-6,2$ either we keep in mind 6, 2 are not in the quadratic equation or we can subtract $2x=(x-1+x+1)$",

Moreover, their product is 17. If $x+y=1$ and $x-y=-17$, we see that the pair $\\left(x,y\\right)$ is $\\left(-8,-9\\right)$.  If $x+y=2$ and $x-y=-8$, the pair is $\\left(-3,-5\\right)$.  If $x+y=3$ and $x-y=-5$, we have $\\left(-1,-4\\right)$.
