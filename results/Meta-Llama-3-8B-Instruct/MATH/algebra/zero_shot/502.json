Plugging these values in, I get\n$\\frac{29}{2}(2(28) + (29-1)(2)) = 29(2(28) + 28) = 87(28) = \\boxed{860}$.\n### Final Answer: The final answer is 860. I hope it is correct.

        "  $28 + 30 + 32 + \\cdots + 86 = 29\\left(\\frac{28+86}2\\right)$.  If we try to find this value with a calculator, we will likely get an incorrect result because the calculator may give an incorrect result.\nWe find that $\\frac{28+86}2=57$ and the 29th partial sum of this series, found by multiplying 29 by 57, gives the value 1663.\nLet\u2019s write $\\sum_{k=1}^{30} x=k\\Delta$ to indicate the sum of the arithmetic series. Here, $k$ is the number of terms in the sum, $x$ is the first term of the series, and $\\Delta$ is the common difference. Here, the formula for this sum is $x + (x+\\Delta) + (x+2\\Delta) + \\cdots + (x+29\\Delta)$.\nWe see that $\\Delta$ in this case is $2$. We have $\\sum_{k=1}^{30} x=k\\Delta$, and solving for $x$ gives us $x=(k-1)\\Delta+x$. This allows us to find $x$, which in this case is $28$.\nThe sum can also be written as $x + (x+\\Delta) + (x+2\\Delta) + \\cdots + (x+29\\Delta) = (1+2+\\cdots+29)\\Delta = \\frac{29\\cdot 30}{2}\\Delta$.\nSimplifying the right-hand side gives us $x + (x+\\Delta) + (x+2\\Delta) + \\cdots + (x+29\\Delta) = 29\\cdot 30\\cdot 1$. When $x=28$ and $\\Delta=2$, the left-hand side simplifies to $28 + 30 + 32 + \\cdots + 86$, so we have found that $28 + 30 + 32 + \\cdots + 86 = 29\\cdot 30\\cdot 1$. This can then be written as $28 + 30 + 32 + \\cdots + 86 = 29\\cdot (28+56)$, which simplifies to $\\boxed{1663}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 1663. I hope it is correct. 1345858577_164163",

        " \nFirst we must calculate the total number of terms in the series which is given by `nk`, where `n` is the first term and `k` is the last term in the series.\n`k = 86` and `n = 28`.\n```\nLet us write k = n + a(j - 1)\nwhere j is the number of terms in the series.\nSolving for j, we get,\nj = (k - n)/a + 1\nGiven that k = 86 and n = 28\nj = (86 - 28)/2 + 1\n= 58\nSo, k = 28 + 2(58 - 1)\n= 28 + 116\n= 144.\n```\nOne way to solve this problem is to calculate the sum of all the terms in the series. Here we know that the first term is `n` = 28, and the last term is `k` = 86, and the difference between the terms is `d` = 2. So, the sum of the series is `Sn = n + (n+d) + (n+2d) + ... + (n+(k-n)d)`. The number of terms `j` can be found by `(k - n)/d + 1 = (86 - 28)/2 + 1` = 59.\nSo, the sum of terms is,\n```\nSn = n * j + j * (j - 1) * d / 2\n= 28 * 59 + 59 * 30\n= 1672 + 1770\n= 3442\n```\nA quicker way is to use the formula `S_n = (n + k) * j / 2` where `n` is the first term, `k` is the `kth` term, and `j` is the number of terms. In this problem, `n = 28`, `k = 86`, and `j = (k-n)/d + 1 = 59`.\n`S_n = (28 + 86) * 59 / 2 = 114 * 59 = 6746`\n### Additional Resources:\nA more comprehensive resource on arithmetic series can be found here:\nhttps://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/mcat/chemical-processes/arithmetic-sequences-member/v/arithmetic-sequences-and-series",

So, the sum of the series is\n$$28 + (28+2) + (28+4) + \\cdots + (86)$$\n$$=28 + 30 + 32 + \\cdots + 86$$\n$$= 28 + 28 + 2 + 28 + 2 + 28 + 4 + \\cdots + 28 + 30 + 2$$\n$$= 28(30) + 2(0+2+4+\\cdots+28)$$\n$$= 28(30) + 2(0 + 2(1+2+\\cdots+14))$$\n$$= 28(30) + 2((1+2+\\cdots+14))$$\n$$= 28(30) + 2(\\frac{(14)!}{1!3!})$$\n$$= 28(30) + 2(\\frac{14\\cdot 13\\cdot 12\\cdot 11\\cdot10\\cdot 9!}{3})$$\n$$= 28(30) + 2\\cdot(14)(13)(10)$$\n$$= 28\\cdot 30 + 3640$$\n$$= 840 + 3640$$\n$$= 4480$$\nSo, the sum of the series is $4480$. But, we know that this value is not equal to $2340$, which we calculated from Method 1. Hence, there is an error somewhere in the steps in Method 2. This is an example of when we have to double-check our work using 2, 3, or more different methods.\nAnd the explanation for the wrong answer 4480:\nThe problem with Method 2 is in this step:\n$$= 28 + 28 + 2 + ",
        " \nMost of the terms are even numbers with differences of 2. Hence we are investigating $28+(28+2)+(28+4)+\\cdots+(28+2n-2) + \\cdots + 86 = ?$\nLet us now convert the sum to form of A.P.A\nwhere $a_1 = 28, d = 2$ and $t = 30.$\n$\\frac{n}{2}(2a_1+(n-1)d)= 28+\\frac{(n-1)2}{2}+ (30)= 28+2n-2+30= 30+2n = 30+2(t-28/2)= 30+2(58/2)= 30+58 = 88$\nWe are looking for the $30$th term. $n=30$. $n(t_1+t_n)/2 = (30*(28+86))/2 = 78*7 = \\boxed{546}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 546.

        " A solution would be to consider the expression $28 + 30 + 32 + \\cdots + 86$ as an arithmetic series. The series $28 + 30 + 32 + \\cdots + 86$ represents an arithmetic progression with the first term $a = 28$ and the last term $l = 86$. To find the common difference $d$, we can easily deduce, by noticing, that $\\boxed{d = 2}.$\n### Note: At this point, there are two ways to find $28 + 30 + 32 + \\cdots + 86$. The simplest way would be to notice that $28 + 30 + 32 + \\cdots + 86$ represents a series of 29 numbers whose mean is $\\frac{28 + 86}{2}$. Now, noticing that $86 = 28 + 58$, we can find that $29{\\times}\\frac{28 + 86}{2}=29{\\times}57=1653$. However, the value of the arithmetic series $28 + 30 + 32 + \\cdots + 86$ itself is equal to $29{\\times}57$ - the first term $a$ of the series, which is $28$. So, $28 + 30 + 32 + \\cdots + 86 = 29{\\times}57-28=29{\\times}57-29+29=1653-29+29=1624$. (The second way would be to use the well known formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence $a$ is $$a_{1}+ a_{2}+ a_{3}+...+ a_{n}=\\frac{n[a_{1} + a_{n}]}{2},$$where $a_{1}$ is the smallest term and $a_{n}$ is the last term. By putting $a_{1}=28$, $a_{n}=86$ and $n=29$ into the above formula and by simplifying, we would arrive at the same solution: $\\boxed{1624}$.)\n### Final Answer: The final answer is 1624.

I hope it is correct. ***Tagger: note*** *A beautiful problem from AoPS! Can someone explain it? The given series can be rearranged as a sequence of 11 numbers that are 2 apart: $28, 30, 32, \\dots, 86.$ All the terms in the sequence are integers. We can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence: $S_n = \\dfrac{n(a_1 + a_n)}{2}$ where $S_n$ is the sum of $n$ numbers, $a_1$ is the first term, and $a_n$ is the last term. In this case, $n = 11$, $a_1 = 28$, and $a_n = 86$. Plugging in these numbers, we get: $S_{11} = \\dfrac{11(28 + 86)}{2} = \\dfrac{11(114)}{2} = 627$. So, the answer is $\\boxed{627}$. ***Tagger: AoPS-whiz*** *The series can also be recognized as the sum of 11 consecutive even numbers separated by 2. If $S$ is the sum, we can write: $S = 29 + 31 + 33 + \\dots + 85 + 87,$ and $S - (28 + 30 + 32 + \\dots + 86) = 28,$ which is just the difference between the largest and smallest terms. Notice that it is a repeating pattern of 2. So, we can also write: $S = (28 + 30 + 32 + \\dots + 86) + (28 + 30 + 32 + \\dots + 86) = 2(28 + 30 + 32 + \\dots + 86).$ Similarly, we can write: $S = 29 + 31 + 33 + \\dots + 85 + 87 = (28 + 30 + 32 + \\dots + 86) + (30 + 32 + \\dots + 86),$ and so on. Combined, they give us: $S = (28 + 30 + 32 + \\dots",
        " (a) Write a general term for the arithmetic series.\nLet\u2019s figure out the first term of the series ($28$). Let\u2019s figure out the common difference ($d$). We are looking at $28$ to $\\ldots$ to $86$. $28$ to $30$ is an increase of $2$. $30$ to $32$ is an increase of $2$. We will have an increase of $2$ every time. Given that we have $58$ terms in total ($28 + 30 + 32$ + $\\cdots$ + $86$), we can write the general term as $28 + (58 - 1)2 = 28 + 116$. So, we can write the general term as $a_n = 28 + 116$.\n### (b) Calculate the sum using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.\nWe can use the formula: $\\mathrm{sum} = \\frac{(\\mathrm{first\\ term}) + (\\mathrm{last\\ term})}{2} \\cdot (\\mathrm{number\\ of\\ terms})$.

        " \nRecall that to get an arithmetic series, you can create a finite arithmetic sequence and add up all the members.\nFor the given arithmetic series, $a = 28$, and a finite running on numbers is $n$. I will add a description to my explanations.\nWe will use this: $a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d$\nWe can find the last element in the series. Setting the last term $a_n = 86$, I will use the formula.\nI set the formula like this: $86 = 28 + (n - 1)d$, or just like that: $28 + (n - 1)d = 86$.\nI will do a little bit a bit of math. $28 + (n - 1)d = 86$, $d = 2$, then I do 28 + 2n, and the last step is to solve for n. Set equal to 86, subtract 28 from both sides, and then subtract 2n from both sides, so on $86 - 28 = n - 1*d, 58 = n - 1$.\nI will go the second step. To the other side, I will add 1.

        " The common difference $d$ for this arithmetic series is $2$. We have $n$ terms, and a starting term of $a=28$. So, the final term is $a_n=86$. We can write the sum of an arithmetic series as $$S=a+\\dfrac{n}{2}(a+a_n)=28+\\dfrac{n}{2}(36+86)=14n+61.$$We are given that $n$ is some number of terms. If we subtract 28 from every term in the series, there are still $n$ terms of 2. So the difference between $a_n$ and $a$ is $86-28=58$. This is the $n$th term of the series whose first term is 0. This means $n=\\dfrac{58}{2}=\\boxed{29}$. Therefore, the sum of the original series is \\begin{align*}\nS&=14n+61\\\\\n&=14(29)+61\\\\\n&=\\boxed{427}\n\\end{align*}###\n### Additional Info:\nThe arithmetic series formula can be found using the concept of difference engineering.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 427. I hope it is correct."
