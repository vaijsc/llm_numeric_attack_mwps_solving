        " First, we convert the equation into standard form: (x+3)^2 + (y-6)^2 = 13. The radius is the square root of 13, or $\\sqrt{13}$. Therefore, the circumference of the circle is $2 \\pi \\sqrt{13}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2 \\pi \\sqrt{13}. I hope it is correct. ##### Hint:... Convert the given equation into standard form for a circle first.  Then, find the value of the radius.  Finally, use the formula to find the circumference. The standard form for a circle is $$(x-h)^2+(y-k)^2=r^2$$ for some center $$(h,k)$$ and radius $$r$$. For example, if we have the equation$$x^2+y^2-4x-6y+4=0$$ we can complete the square, which is what we did above, to get $$(x-2)^2+(y-3)^2=4$$. Alternatively, if the equation is$$x^2+y^2+4x-2y+1=0$$we can complete the square by factoring: $$(x+2)^2+(y-1)^2=1$$. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions. #### Addendum: To be true to the original question, I should point out that we could also factor the polynomial as follows: $$(x+3)^2+(y-6)^2-13=0$$Now we have a perfect square trinomial for $$(x+3)^2$$ and $$(y-6)^2$$, which will help us complete the square even more easily. WIth this factored form, we have: \\begin{align*} (x+3)^2+(y-6)^2&=13\\\\ (x+3)^2&=13\\\\ x+3&=\\pm \\sqrt{13}\\\\ x&=3\\pm \\sqrt{13} \\end{align*}At this point we could also solve for $$y$$: \\begin{align*} 0&=y^2-12y+39\\\\ y&=6 \\pm \\sqrt{9}\\\\ y&=6 \\pm 3 \\end{align*}In either case, we can now easily compute the radius of the circle.

I'm thinking that we can get a system of equations by setting the equation equal to $y$ and plugging in $(x, y) = (-4, 5)$ and $(1, 2),$ but I'm not sure what to do next. sigh",

From this form, we can determine that the circle is centered at $(-3,6)$ and has a radius of $r=7$ units, which in turn, is used to find the circumference of the circle. The equation given above can be interpreted as a circle with a circle. Consequently, the problem becomes effectively easier to solve once we have the equation of the circle in the more familiar form $(x-h)^2+(y-k)^2=r^2$.\nFor problems like this, it\"s a good idea to lsolve the given equation first for $x$ in terms of $y$ in order to obtain the equation of a circle.
