It's the first time I am trying the this task.\n### Explanation: \nSuppose we compute $(3-i)(6+2i)$ without knowing the above formula.  The simplest way of doing this is by distributing the $\\left(3-i\\right)$ over the $\\left(6+2i\\right)$, while assuming that we don't know the value of $i^2$ beforehand: $$\\left(3-i\\right)\\left(6+2i\\right)=3\\left(6+2i\\right)-i\\left(6+2i\\right)=18+6i-6i-2i^2.$$So far, we haven't used the fact that $i^2=-1$.  But, if we actually compute $i^2$ at this point, we will have: $$i^2=\\left(\\sqrt{-1}\\right)^2=-1.$$Substituting this in, we obtain: $$18+6i-6i-2(-1)=18+6i+6i+2=18+12i+2=20+12i.$$Since $i^2=-1$, we could have anticipated $-2i^2=2$.  You never know ahead of time that $i^2=-1$, since $i$ is just some algebraic variable which may have any value we like, and this formula gives us the best method for finding what value it should have.  Now our intermediate result is $20+12i$, and simplifying this is just a matter of multiplying by whatever rational number we want.  There isn't anything else there. So, we obtain $i^2=20$.  But, in fact, our result simplifies to ",
