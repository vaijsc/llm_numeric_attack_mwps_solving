        " \nLet\u2019s find the domain by finding the places where the expression inside the square root is non-negative.\nSince the radicand, $-6x^2+11x-4$, is a quadratic expression, it can be written in the form $ax^2+bx+c.$ \nIn this case, we have \\[ax^2+bx+c=-6x^2+11x-4.\\] Therefore, $a=-6,$ $b=11,$ and $c=-4.$\nThe quadratic formula for the roots of a quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ is given by \\[x=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}.\\] For the quadratic expression $ax^2+bx+c$, the quadratic formula tells us that the expression will equal zero whenever $$x=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}.$$In this case, we want the radicand to be non-negative.

        " The expression under the square root sign needs to be non-negative. Therefore,\n$(-6x^2+11x-4)\\ge0$, $\\Rightarrow 36x^2-66x+25\\ge0$. We need to factor the LHS polynomial, and we have\n$$(6x-5)(6x-5)=36x^2-60x+25\\ge0$$Now, for equality to hold, we must either have $6x-5=0$, i.e. $x=\\frac{5}{6}$, or both $6x-5\\ge0$ and $36x^2-60x+25\\ge0$. The second condition is that\n$$36x^2-60x\\ge-25$$or $$(6x-5)^2\\ge0.$$We know that $6x-5\\ge0$, so $6x-5=|6x-5|$. Because the left-hand side is non-negative, we conclude that $|x-\\frac{5}{6}|\\ge0$; therefore, $x-\\frac{5}{6}$ can be either $0$ or positive. If it is positive, we have $x\\ge\\frac{5}{6}$, and combining this with $6x-5\\ge0$, we have $x\\ge1$. If, on the other hand, $x-\\frac{5}{6}=0$, we have $x=\\frac{5}{6}$, which is also the smallest possible value for $x$. Therefore, the inequality $36x^2-60x\\ge-25$ holds for $x\\ge 1$, and so the domain is given by $[1,\\infty)$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is [1,\\infty). I hope it is correct. ### Remark: Overall, our instruction is usually asking for the domain to exclude any holes. In this particular problem, we have a domain of $[1,\\infty)$, which includes the point $x=1$, while in general we exclude such points. We are encouraged to draw a graph to find the domain, but our instruction does not require it, so we have not done that in our solution.

        " \nConsider the function $f(x) = \\sqrt{-6x^2 + 11x - 4}.$ We can rewrite the function by subtracting $4$ and dividing by $-6$:\n$$f(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{-6x^2+11x-4}{6}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{-6x^2-4x+3x-4}{6}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{-2x(x-2)+1(x-2)}{6}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{(x-2)(-2x+1)}{6}}.$$\nIn order for the expression under the square root to be non-negative, we need\n$(x-2)(-2x+1) \\ge 0.$\nBy considering the product of two binomials, we can factor the expression as $(x-2)(2x-1)$ and we see that we need exactly one of the factors to be zero to get the product to be zero. Thus, we consider the linear equations $x-2 = 0$ and $2x-1 = 0.$ The solution to $x - 2 = 0$ is $\\boxed{x = 2}$ and the solution to $2x-1 = 0$ is $\\boxed{x = \\frac{1}{2}}.$ To find the domain, we need to exclude the points that correspond to the zeros of the rational expression.
