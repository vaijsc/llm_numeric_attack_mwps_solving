        " Write your equation and step-by-step solution.\nLet\u2019s think step by step.\nFirst, let\u2019s solve $2(6) + 4(3)$.\n$2(6) = 12$ and $4(3) = 12$. So, $12 + 12 = 24$.\nNext, let\u2019s solve $8(3+3)$.\n$8(3+3) = 8(6) = 48$.\nFinally, find the positive difference between $24$ and $48$.\n$48 - 24 = 24$.\n### Sanity Check:\nWe can check our work by adding or subtracting the factors in the expression $2(6) + 4(3)$ to ensure the answer is reasonable. Add the parts, $2(6) = 12$ and $4(3) = 12$. So, $2(6) + 4(3) = 12 + 12 = 24$. The result is reasonable. The second part of this logoi chose the number 8 times to simplify. Clearly, we also add the number 8 in this case.\n### Correct Solution:\n$2(6) + 4(3)$ is obtained by evaluating the expression. The results are 12 and 12, respectively. The overall result turns out to be 24. The last part of the equation is $8(3+3)$. This expression is evaluated by multiplying or adding, which turns out to be 48. Finally, to compare the results, the difference is obtained by subtracting 24 from 48, which results in 24. The final result must be positive. Therefore, the positive difference between our methods is 24.\n## Python3 code below\n```Python\n# Our expression\nx = 2 * 6 + 4 * 3\ny = 8 * (3 + 3)\n# Calculate both sides\nx_result = x\ny_result = y\n# Print the results\nprint(\"First part of equation: \", x_result)\nprint(\"Second part of equation: \", y_result)\n# Calculate the difference\ndifference = y_result - x_result\n# Print the result\nprint(\"The positive difference between the two parts of the equation is: \", difference)\n```\n### ",
        " 2(6) + 4(3) = 12 + 12 = 24\n8(3+3) = 8(6) = 48\n### The positive difference: 48 - 24 = 24",
        " $\\boxed{4}$\nSolution .\nLowercase denotes $2(6) + 4(3) = 12 + 12 = 24$.\nAnd solve $8(3+3)$ to get $24$ as well.\nThe difference between $24$ and $24$ is $4$. I hope it is correct. Thanks for your time.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 4. I hope it is correct.### "
