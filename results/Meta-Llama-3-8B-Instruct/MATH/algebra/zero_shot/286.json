        " We know that the charge for a one-hour job is $\\$97$; however, we only know that part of this charge is for Mr. Wrench coming to the house, and the rest is for his one-hour work. So a more useful piece of information would be knowing exactly how much Mr. Wrench charges for coming to the house, and we can try to deduce it from the information provided. Since Mr. Wrench charges$\\$N$ dollars for coming to the house, he charges $\\$(N + x)$for a one-hour job, where$x$is his hourly wage.  Let\u2019s try to subtract a little bit and see what comes out: N+N+N+x=97 SubtractingNfrom both sides, we get N+x=97\u2212N x=97\u2212N Simplifying,x equals 97 minusN. Now, let\u2019s use this new information to solve forN. From a two-hour repair job, we can start making calculations: 2x+97 N+x Let\u2019s use our expression forx. We get 2(97\u2212N)+97 N+N Using the distributive property,we expand: 194\u22122N+97 N+N We simplify and put all terms saveN on the left side. 97N\u22122N=194\u221297 We solve forN: 97N\u22122N=194\u221297 95N=97 From this point on,there is only one option: we divide both sides by95: N=97\u204495 We simplify: N=1.02 Rewind back to our x equation and we can substitute the value of N.  x=97\u22121.02 Simplifying, we have: x=95.98 This is our final answer.

        " For each plumbing repair job, Mr. Wrench charges \\displaystyle N dollars for coming out to the house. We can\u2019t know the value of $N$ from the given information. Mr. Wrench also charges $x$ dollars per hour he works at the house. For the two jobs, Mr. Wrench worked for a total of 1+5=6 hours. Since he worked for a total of 6 hours and his fixed charge is$N$, his charge for the two jobs equals $N+6x$. Since he charged $97 for the 1-hour job and$265 for the 5-hour job, and the charge for each job is $N + x\\cdot \\text{hours worked}$, we have that \\begin{align*} N+1x &= 97,\\\\ N+5x &= 265. \\end{align*} We can subtract the first equation from the second equation to find that $4x = 168$. Therefore, $x=168/4=42$, so Mr. Wrench charges $\\42$ per hour. To find his charge for a two-hour repair job, we multiply the rate of $x=42$ by the time, $2$, to get his charge for the 2-hour job: $42\\cdot 2=\\boxed{\\84}.$ Final Answer: The final answer is $\\84$. I hope it is correct. The best way to describe Mr. Wrench\u2019s payment policy is the linear equation $N+xh$, where $N$ is the fixed charge, $h$ is the number of hours worked, and $x$ is the rate per hour. For a one-hour job, he charges $N+1x=97$, and for a five-hour job, he charges $N+5x=265$.  We can then subtract the first equation from the second equation to find that \\begin{align*} (N+5x)-(N+1x)&=265-97\\\\ \\Rightarrow 4x &= 168\\\\ \\Rightarrow x &= 168/4=42. \\end{align*} Therefore, Mr. Wrench charges $\\42$ per hour. To find his charge for the two-hour job, we multiply the rate of $x=42$ by the time, $2$, to get his charge for the 2-hour job: $2\\cdot 42=\\boxed{\\84}.$ Therefore, Mr. Wrench charges $\\84$ for",
        " The first thing to observe is that Mr. Wrench charges the same amount for each job, so there is a constant number $N$ for the initial charge and $x$ for each subsequent hour. Let\u2019s start by considering the 5-hour repair job. He charged$\\$265$, and this is $N + 5x$.  We are given that he charged $\\$97$for a 1-hour repair job, so this must be $N + 1x$, and we can set up the equation $N + 5x = 265$. By subtracting $N$ from both sides and then dividing by $4$, we can solve for $x$: \\begin{align*} x&=(265-N)/4\\\\\n\\end{align*}Now, the cost for a 2-hour repair job is $N + 2x$, so we plug in our expression for $x$ to get $N + 2(265-N)/4 = N + 132.5 - N/2$. This simplifies to $N + 132.5 - N/2 = N + 265 - N = \\boxed{\\$133}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 133. I hope it is correct.  Please let me know if this is correct.  It seems to be correct according to my calculations.   That's all we can do.\nWe hope to have clarified any pitfalls in the problem, and you should now feel confident in finding the cost of the 2-hour repair job.

So in a 1 hour job, he makes $\\$N+x$. In a 5 hour job, he makes $\\$N+5x$. Now we know that in a one-hour job, Mr. Wrench made$\\$97$.  So we know that $\\$N+x=\\$97$. We don\u2019t yet know what $N$is, but we do know that it\u2019s there.

        "  We are given that Mr. Wrench charges \\$$N$ dollars for coming out to the house and $$x$ dollars per hour that he works. Mr. Wrench is charging 87$ more dollars for a 5 hour repair job compared to the 1 hour repair job. We know that he charges 97 dollars for the one hour repair job, so this means he must have charged 215$ for the 5 hour job. This means that he charges \\$$N + 5x$ dollars for the 5 hour job. We now have the equation:  N + 5x = 215 We also know that he charges \\$$N + x$ dollars for the one hour job. This means that he charges $$N + 1x$ dollars for the 2 hour job. We now have the equation: N + 1x =$97 We now see that we have two equations (N + 5x = 215 and N + 1x = 97). Let\u2019s solve this system of equations. We start by subtracting the second equation from the first equation, which gives us: 4x = 118 We now divide both sides of the equation by 4: x = 29.5 We now know that Mr. Wrench charges \\$$29.5$ per hour. We can now substitute 29.5 in one of our original equations, say N + 5x.

Let me elaborate on it a bit more. Now let\u2019s see how we got our solution. We have two different scenarios in which Mr. Wrench made some money. Firstly, we know that Mr. Wrench charged$\\$97$ for a one-hour repair job. This amount is not just the cost of the components needed to fix the particular leak or the cost of transportation needed to reach the house. It\u2019s the amount he actually made. This amount should include all of the above costs which is how he makes his living. Therefore, this amount also has his charge for coming out to the house and for the actual work he did. This is what he gets when he is working for one hour. Let\u2019s call that amount$N$.We know that after this work he should get an extra amount of $x$ per hour. This is an hourly rate. This will be his extra income when he extends his work. In other words, when he is working for an additional hour, his payment will be$N + x$This is how we get our equation$N + 1x = 97$.Mr. Wrench also charged$\\$265$ for a five-hour repair job. This is the amount he actually made. Similarly, we can model it. He makes$\\$N$ for coming out and then he charges his hourly rate for five hours of",

        " To express the problem using maths, let $x$ be the number of dollars that he charges for each hour. To find the total number of dollars that he charges for the one-hour repair job, we can write an equation. The total cost for the one-hour repair job is $\\$N + x\\cdot 1$. Similarly, the total cost for a five-hour repair job is $\\$N + x\\cdot 5$.\nWe know the cost for the one-hour job is $\\$97$, so we can set up an equation $$N + x = 97.$$We also know the cost for the five-hour job is$\\$265$, so we can set up an equation $$N + 5x = 265.$$Now, we can solve this system of equations. Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get\n$$(5x-x) = 265-97$$\n$$4x = 168$$\n$$x = 42$$\nSubstituting $x=42$ in the first equation, we get\n$N + 42 = 97$\n$$N = 55$$\nThus, Mr. Wrench charges $\\$55$for coming to the house plus$\\$42$ per hour. What does he charge for a two-hour repair job? He charges $\\$55 + 2\\cdot 42 = \\boxed{\\$139}$. Final Answer: The final answer is$139$. I hope it is correct. Final Answer: The final answer is$139$.

        "  To begin, consider the one-hour job.  Mr. Wrench comes out to the house and charges $\\$N$ for that and spends one hour working on the job costing$\\$x$ dollars per hour.  So we have \\begin{align*}97&=N+x\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad\\boxed{x=97-N}.\\end{align*} Now consider the five-hour job, so he must work for five hours.  Since he charges$N$for the initial visit, the five-hour job has a price of $$N+5x= N+5(97-N) =210.$$  We can find$N$: \\begin{align*} N &= 265 - 5(97) = 265 - 485 = \\boxed{-220}.\\end{align*} Therefore,$x=97-(-220)=317$.  This means that Mr. Wrench comes out to a house and charges$\\$220$ dollars for the initial visit.  For every hour he works, he charges $\\$317$ dollars.  The cost for a two-hour repair job is \\boxed{\\$220+(2)(317)=954} dollars. Final Answer: The final answer is 954. I hope it is correct. #### How to Answer Going through the answer given by the instructor: An explanation (by Amit) MR Wrench charges $N$ for coming to the house and$ x $for working an hour at the house. A one-hour job costs 97, which is$N+x$. For five hour jo, it costs 265, which is$N+5x$. From one hour, we get $x= 97-N$. From 5-hour job, we get 220 for N. Put $x= 97-N$, in $N+5x$ we get 265 which is $N + 5(97-N)$ Now simplifying N = 265 - 5(97) = 265 - 485 = -220. So$ N = -220. Therefore$ x = 97 - (-220) = 317. So for two hour job$N+z 2 = 220 + 2(317) = 954. Final Answer: The final answer is 954. I hope it is correct. # Conclusion There is a method to solve this problem. Use the information provided to find the cost pattern for a plumbing repair job. Use the given values to find the constant factors.",
        " First, we notice the charge $N$ is the constant charge. So we can take the difference of the observations and the cost $x\\cdot h$ to get just the constant charge:\n$$x\\cdot5-\\x\\cdot1=265-97=168.$$This equals $4x$.  We are now looking for the 2-hour job, which costs $N + 2x$.  So, we can take the difference between the expressions we know:\n\\begin{align*}\nN+5x-&(N+2x)=168\\\\\n\\Rightarrow 3x&=168\\\\\n\\Rightarrow x&=56.\n\\end{align*}Then we can get the required value for the 2-hour job:\n\\begin{align*}\nN+2\\cdot56&=N+112.\n\\end{align*}The value of $N$ is unknown, but we know that $$N = 265 - 5\\cdot56 = 265 - 280 = \\boxed{ -15}.$$The two-hour job will thus cost $$-15+112 = \\boxed{ 97}.$$ Final Answer: The final answer is 97. I hope it is correct.\n### Explanation: If Mr. Wrench charges $N$ dollars for coming to the house, plus $x$ dollars per hour that he works, then $\\$N+\\phantom{xx} x$costs him coming out and working for $\\phantom{x} 1$hour, and $\\$N+5x$costs him coming out and working for $\\phantom{x} 5$hours. Since the total charge for a one-hour job is$\\$97$, and the total charge for a five-hour job is $\\$265$, we must have $$N+\\phantom{xx} x=97\\qquad\\text{and}\\qquad N+5x=265.$$ Subtracting these two equations gives $$4x=168\\Rightarrow x=56.$$ This makes the first equation $$N+56=97\\Rightarrow N=-15.$$ Thus the charge for a two-hour job will be $$-15+2x=-15+2\\cdot 56=-15+112=\\boxed{\\$97}$$.Final Answer: The final answer is 97. I hope it is correct.### Detail explanation:Let $N$ be the fixed charge and $x$ be the per-hour charge of Mr. Wrench. Then the total",

Directions: 2(N+2x) = 2(N+2(168-2N)/6) = 2(N+84-2N/3) 2(N+2x) = 2(N+84-N/3) By combining like terms, we have 2(N+2x) = (2N+168-N)/3 2(N+2x) = (3N+168)/3 Directions: Now we can write 2(N+2x) = (3N+168)/3 Since 2(N+2x) is equivalent to 2(N+84-N/3), we can substitute 168 for 2N: 2(N+84-N/3) = (3N+168)/3 Directions: Plug that value back in. 0 = -N + 168 Directions: Now we can solve. 0 = -N + 168 Therefore, N = 168 Let\u2019s plug the value back in for N, our N value. x = 97 - 168 = -71 Directions: Since we have the number, we can add 2x because we have the number in the equation. 2x = 2(-71) = -142 Directions: Now the answer is the answer for the equation. Mr. Wrench charges $142 for the two-hour repair job. Final Answer: The final answer is \\$142. I hope it is correct. Final Answer: The final answer is \\$142. I hope it is correct.
