When we substitute $x$ in a polynomial expression with $x-1$, we create a new polynomial with terms that arise by replacing each term in the original polynomial by a term in the new polynomial that arises from the application of the rule $x \\mapsto x-1$ on the original term.\nNow, let's look at the polynomial $f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2$.\nWhen we substitute each occurrence of $x$ in $f(x)$ with $x-1$, we create a new polynomial $g(x)$ with terms that arise from each term in $f(x)$.\nLet's examine $f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2$.\n1.

I hope it is correct.  <br> For a polynomial $f(x)$ of the form $f(x)=a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+a_3x^3+\\cdots+a_nx^n$, let $g(x)$ be the polynomial $f(x+c)$.  To expand $f(x+c)$, substitute $x+c$ for $x$ in $f(x)$: \\begin{align*}\nf(x+c)&=a_0+a_1(x+c)+a_2(x+c)^2+a_3(x+c)^3+\\cdots+a_n(x+c)^n\\\\\n&=a_0+a_1x+a_1c+a_2x^2+2a_2xc+a_2c^2+\\cdots+a_nx^n+c(a_1+2a_2c+\\cdots+a_nx^{n-1})+c^n\\\\\n&=a_0+(a_1+2a_2c+\\cdots+a_nx^{n-1})x+(a_1c+a_2c^2+\\cdots+a_nc^{n-1})+c^n\n\\end{align*}We can now see that if we expand $f(x+c)$, we are adding linear terms to the original polynomial $f(x)$, and our new polynomial will now have terms with exponent $n-1$ and a leading term of $c^n$.  We can pretty easily see that if we want to expand $f(x-1)$, we should just substitute $x-1$ for $x$ in the original polynomial: \\begin{align*}\nf(x-1)&=3(x-1)^4+5(x-1)^2-9(x-1)-2\\\\\n&=3(x^4-4x^3+6x^2-4x+1)+5(x^2-2x+1)-9x+9-2\\\\\n&=3x^4-12x^3+18x^2-12x+3+5x^2-10x+5-9x+9-2\n\\end{align*}Now we can combine like terms and simplify: \\begin{",

        " \nGiven that  $f(x) = 3x^4+5x^2-9x-2$, we can try to get $g(x)$.\nWe apply this change of base form: $f(x-1)$, we have to change $x$ to $x+1$.\n$f(x+1) = 3(x+1)^4+5(x+1)^2-9(x+1)-2$.\nChange $(x+1)^4$ to $x^4+4x^3+6x^2+4x+1$\nChange $(x+1)^2$ to $x^2+2x+1$\nSo we have\n$f(x+1) = 3x^4+12x^3+18x^2+12x+3+5x^2+10x+5-9x-9-2$.\nCombine the terms.\n$f(x+1) = 3x^4+12x^3+23x^2+3x-6$.\nSo we can use this expression for the question.\nThe sum of the coefficients of $g$ is: $3+12+23+3-6$ that is $\\boxed{31}$. \n#### Note: I might not be very accurate with my solution, but my main point is to change $x$ to $x+1$ and thus, we have to replace $x^4$ with $(x+1)^4$, $(x+1)^2$ and so on.\nThank you, Nigel! \nFinal Answer: The final answer is 31.
