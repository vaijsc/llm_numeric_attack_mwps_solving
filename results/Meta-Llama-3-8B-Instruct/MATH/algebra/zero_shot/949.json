When $i$ is replaced with $j$, where $i = \\sqrt{-1} = j$, we have $$(2 + 3j)(1 \u2013 2j) = 2 + 3j \u2013 6j^2 \u2013 2j^3 + 6j\\\\= 2 \u2013 18j + 3j - 6j^2 + 6j\\\\=2 \u2013 12j + 6j + 18j^2\\\\= 2 \u2013 12j - 18j^2$$where $j^3 = -1$ and we have added for clarity. It\u2019s worth noting that by factoring out the common factor $1-2i$, we have that $(2+3i)(1-2i) = (2+3i-3i-6i^2) = 2 \u2013 6i^2$. Thus by multiplying the numerator and denominator by $i$, we get\n$$(2+3i)(1-2i) = \\frac{2-6i^2}{1}\\\\= \\frac{2+6}{1}\\\\= 8.$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 8 + (-1)i. I hope it is correct.
