I hope it is correct.\n### Note:- An exponent inside another exponent (like in the problem) is evaluated left to right. So inside the exponent of $\\left(2^3\\right)^{\\frac{4}{3}}$ is $2^3$. The power $2^3$ is being raised to the power $\\frac{4}{3}$. We calculate the power of $2^3$ first: $2^3 = 8$. Then, we can use the property $\\left(x^n\\right)^m = x^{nm}$ to simplify the expression: $\\left(2^3\\right)^{\\frac{4}{3}} = \\left(8\\right)^{\\frac{4}{3}} = 8^{\\frac{4}{3}} \\cdot \\frac{4}{3} = 2^4 = 16$. So, the value of $\\left(2^3\\right)^{\\frac{4}{3}}$ is 16. $\\left(2^3\\right)^{\\frac{4}{3}} = 2^4 = \\boxed{16}$.\nNote:-\nThe rule we used here was exponent rules,\n(x^a)^(b) = x^(a*b)\nX^n m = x^(n*m)\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 16.

        " The value is 8.\nWell done! The way I arrived at the answer was by following the order of operations $3-n$ (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication/Division, Addition/SUBTRACTION). In this case, it was easier to simplify in this order, by first, $2^3=8$ and then, $8^{4/3}=(8^{\\frac{1}{3}})^4=2^4=\\boxed{16}$. Looking at the problem again, I will realize that we can directly see that $(2^3)^{4/3} = 2^4 = \\boxed{16}$.
