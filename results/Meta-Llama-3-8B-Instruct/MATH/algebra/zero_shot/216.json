Now we have a system of simultaneous equations. We now need to solve for $A$, $B$, and $C$. From the equation 5A=C, we can substitute into the equation B=A-C to get B=5A-A=C.

When we expand it out, we get\n$(3Ay+B)(y-C)=3Ay^2-3ACy+B(1C)-B = 3Ay^2-3ACy-(B)$.Now the problem asks for the expression in the form $6y^2-y-51$, which we know as $6y^2-7y-51=0$.

There is a possible factorization:\n$$6y^2 - y - 51 = (2y - 1)(3y + 51).$$However, there is a problem since the exponents of the two factor are not equal, but they should be since $A(y-c)$ has only one variable.\nNow, we will try to continue the factorization, for instance:\n\\begin{align*}\n(2y-1)(3y+51) &= 6y^2 + 99 y+3y -51\\\\\n&= 6y^2 + 102 y -51\n\\end{align*}Using the original expression as reference, we found that there is a lack of 3y, so now we are going to break it down even more:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\cdots &= 6y^2 + 99 y + 3y -51\\\\\n&= 6y^2 + 102 y -51\\\\\n&= \\boxed{(6y-51)(y+3)}\n\\end{align*} Since we already did it, we could simply type in the last two expressions directly.

        " Here is the response in step by step format.\nStep 1: Comparing coefficients.\nTo have the same coefficients, we require that\n$$6y^2-y-51=A(3Ay^2-yC)+BCy-AC=y(A(3A)-C)+B(C-1)y-AC\\Rightarrow6=A(3A)-C,\\; B=C-1,\\; 51=y(AC)-AC.$$We want $A$, $B$, and $C$ to be positive integers. Since $51$ is negative, we have that $$y<-AC\\Rightarrow-(AC)<-51\\Rightarrow AC>51.$$We are forced to set $y=-C$ to make the right side negative.  [Note that this will give some system with a single solution]\nNow, we are solving for $A$, $B$, and $C$:\n\\begin{align*}\n&6=A(3A)-C\\\\\n&51=-AC\n\\end{align*}\nStep 2: Solving for $A$, $B$, and $C$.\nNow, we require that\n\\begin{align*}\n6=A(3A)-C&\\Rightarrow C=A(3A-6),\\\\\n51=-AC&\\Rightarrow C=51/A\\Rightarrow A=\\frac{51}{C}.\n\\end{align*}\nTherefore,\n$$6={3A^2\\over C}-C={3(51)^2\\over C^2}-C.$$We simplify to obtain\n$$6C^2-3(51)^2=C\\Rightarrow C^2-{3\\cdot49\\cdot 51\\over 1}=0.$$Factoring gives\n$$(C+21)(C-7)=0\\Rightarrow c\\in\\{-21,7\\}.$$If $C=-21$, then $A=\\frac{51}{-21}=-\\frac{3}{1}$, so that $B=-\\frac{4}{3}$.  But this is not a positive integer solution for $A$, $B$, $C$.\nThus, $C=7$, so $A={51\\over 7}=7\\frac{2}{7}$, and $B=6$.  Hence, $(AC)^2-B={49\\cdot 6\\over 1}-6=\\boxed{232}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 232. I hope it is correct.",
        " We can try to find possible factors for the expression:\n$$6y^2-y-51=(3Ay+B)(y-C).$$\nIt is given that $A$, $B$ and $C$ are positive integers.\n",
        "  \\begin{align*}\n6y^2-y-51\n&=(3y-A)(2y+B)\\\\\n&=(3y-A)(2y+B)\\left(\\frac{6y-A}{6y-A}\\right)\\\\\n&=\\frac{(6y-A)(3y-A)(2y+B)}{6y-A}\\\\\n&=\\frac{6y^2-Ay-3Ay+Ab-2Ay-AB}{6y-A}\\\\\n&=y^2+\\left(\\frac{-5A+Ab}{6}\\right)y+\\left(\\frac{-AB+51}{6}\\right)\\\\\n&\\downarrow\\\\\n6y^2-y-51\n&=y^2+\\left(\\frac{-5A+Ab}{6}\\right)y+\\left(\\frac{-AB+51}{6}\\right).\n\\end{align*}\nSo $A$ and $B$ are the roots, we get from this that $5A+Ab=-6$ and $AB=51.$ We are told that $A$ and $B$ are positive.  Note that $A=1$ and $B=51$ works.  As $51\\times1=51,$ it is a valid solution.\nNow $(AC)^2-B=1\\times51-51=\\boxed{0}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 0. I hope it is correct.",
        " First and third terms of the expression should be the product of $y-C$ and two linear terms.\nThis is because the product of two linear terms and $y-C$ is $by-Cy+(Ay-C^2)=Ay-by+Cy-C^2$, which is already in the form $Ay^2-by-c$. Hence, the linear terms of the further factorization are $3Ay$ and $-B$, and the constant term of the further factorization is $-C^2$.\n### 2. Variables on the constant term are $A$ and $C$.\nIf we put $A=1$ and $B=3C^2$ in first term, we get $y-C$. Similar procedure is applied to the third term, and we get $C^2=51$. Hence, $C=7$.\nSince $B$ is $3C^2=3\\times49=147$, the desired result is $$(AC)^2-B=(7\\times1)^2-147=\\boxed{56}.$$ Hope you like my explanation. In case you are still confused, I can add more details.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 56. I hope it is correct. I got this solved by finding out the values for A and B terms in the expression. The value of C is already given by 7 in the question. The steps I followed to find out the values of A and B are:-\n1. Split the given expression into two parts: first (Ayy-Cy) + the second (-By+C^2).\n2. Ayy-Cy will be the product of two linear terms (Ayy-By+Cy). So, A = 1/B:- Hint: You can either remember it from previous class or use guess and check method to find out the value of A.\n3. So, A = 1/B:- This means that A will always be the reciprocal of B. For the value of B, once you know the value of A, then B will be inversely proportional to A.\n4. The second term -By+C^2 will be separately factored as -B(y-C).\n5. In order to find out the value of B, we are given B(y-C) to be y-3y+7. In other words, we are looking for the coefficient of y in the second term which must be -B. Now, the coefficient of y in the second term is -3"
