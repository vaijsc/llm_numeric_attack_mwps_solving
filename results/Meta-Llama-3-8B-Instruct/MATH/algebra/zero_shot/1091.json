    "solution": "We could subtract $292$ to the other side and try to solve the sixth-degree equation, but that would be ugly and we have no guarantee that it would even work. We notice that we can add a $x^4-x^4 + x^2 - x^2$ to the polynomial without changing its value: $$x^6-2x^5+(x^4-x^4)+2x^3+(x^2-x^2)-2x+1=292.$$ We regroup the terms and factor the left side, leaving the $292$ alone. \\begin{align*}\n(x^6-2x^5+x^4)+(-x^4+2x^3+-x^2)+(x^2-2x+1)&=292\\\\\nx^4(x^2-2x+1)-x^2(x^2-2x+1)+1(x^2-2x+1)&=292\\\\\n(x^2-2x+1)(x^4-x^2+1)&=292\\\\\n(x-1)^2(x^4-x^2+1)&=292.\n\\end{align*} To see a different way of obtaining this factorization, we could also group the $x^6$ and $1$ terms together and factor, giving: \\begin{align*}\n(x^6+1)+(-2x^5+2x^3-2x)&=292\\\\\n(x^2+1)(x^4-x^2+1)-2x(x^4-x^2+1)&=292\\\\\n(x^4-x^2+1)(x^2+1-2x)&=292\\\\\n(x^4-x^2+1)(x-1)^2&=292.\\\\\n\\end{align*} Since $x$ is an integer, then $x^4-x^2+1$ and $x-1$ are integers, so they must be factors of $292$. The prime factorization of $292$ is $2^2\\cdot 73$. The value $(x-1)^2$ must be a square which divides $292$, and we can see that the only squares which divide $292$ are $1$ and $4$.\n\nIf $(x-1)^2=1$, then $x-1=\\pm 1$, and $x=2$ or $x=0$. If $x=0$, it's easy to see from the original equation that it won't work, since the left side of the original equation would be $1$ while the right side would be $292$. If $x=2$, then the left side would equal $(2^4-2^2+1)(2-1)^2=(16-4+1)(1)^2=13\\neq 292$. So both values of $x$ are impossible.\n\nThus $(x-1)^2=4$, so $x-1=\\pm 2$ and $x=3$ or $x=-1$. If $x=-1$, then we have the left side as $((-1)^4-(-1)^2+1)((-1)-1)^2=(1-1+1)(-2)^2=1(4)=4\\neq 292$. If $x=3$, then we have $(3^4-3^2+1)(3-1)^2=(81-9+1)(2^2)=73\\cdot2^2=292$ as desired. Thus the only possibility for $x$ is $\\boxed{3}$.",

        " First, note that $x^6-2x^5+2x^3-2x+1=(x^6-2x^5+x^4+x^4-2x^3+2x-2x+1)=(x^4+1)(x^2-2x+1)=\\frac{(x^4+1)}{(x^2-1)}((x^2-1)(x^2-2x+1))=\\frac{(x^4+1)}{(x^2-1)}(x^4-2x^3+x^2)$.\nThen using difference-of-squares factorization, we have\n$$x^4-2x^3+x^2=(x^2-1)^2.$$\nSo the above equation becomes\n\\begin{align*} \\frac{(x^4+1)}{(x^2-1)}((x^2-1)^2) &=292\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad (x^4+1) &=4\\cdot73\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad (x^2)^2+1 &= 4\\cdot 73\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad (x^2)^2 - 361k+1 &= 0\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad (x^2-19k)^2 &= 361(k^2-1) \\end{align*}\nBecause the above equation is a square of a difference, the left-hand side is nonnegative, so $k^2-1$ is nonnegative, hence $k^2 \\ge 1 \\Rightarrow k\\ge 1$, and $x^2\\ge 19k\\ge 19$.\nBut because the right-hand side is also nonnegative, the left-hand side must also be nonnegative, so $(x^2)^2 \\ge k^2$.\nWe have shown that $x^2\\ge 19, 1$ and relate $x^2$ to $k$.

        " x=2$ Specifically, $x$ is an integer because we know that the polynomial $f(x)=x^6-2x^5+2x^3-2x+1$ has integer coefficients and we are asked to find its solution $x$ in $\\mathbb Z$.

We see that we need to subtract $292$ because we obtain the remainder equal to $292$. Performing the division step by step, we have\\begin{align*}\n(x-1)(x-2)(x^4+2x^3+x^2+2x+1)+316x^2-2x-1 &=292,\\\\\nx^5-2x^4+x^3-2x^2+x-2x^4+4x^3+2x^2-2x &=292\\\\\n(x-1)(x-2)(x^4+x^3+2x^2+x)+2x^4 &=292,\\\\\n(x-1)(x-2)(x^4+x^3+2x^2+x)+(x^4+2x^3+2x^2+2x)-x^4 &=292\\\\\n(x-1)(x-2)(x^4+2x^3+2x^2+x)=\\boxed{292}.\n\\end{align*}Now we have $292=(x-1)(x-2)(x^4+2x^3+2x^2+x)$, which by substituting $x=2$ gives true, and thus we have $x=2$.

Then the above equality becomes $$(y+1)^2(y+1)^4=292.$$\nNow, it remains to solve $(y+1)^2(y+1)^4=292$.  Notice that $292=1\\cdot 292=2\\cdot 146=4\\cdot 73=8\\cdot 37=\\ldots$.  From this, it follows that $y+1=\\pm2$, $\\pm4$, $\\pm8$, $\\pm37$.  Of these, only the last two values yield positive values of $(y+1)^2(y+1)^4=292$, which thus gives us $y=\\pm36$.  Since $x=y+1$, we conclude that $x=37$ or $x=-35$.\nFinal Answer: The final answers are x=37 and x=-35. I hope it is correct. 292\nLet\u2019s think step by step.\n### ",
        "Modulo 7, $x^6-2x^5+2x^3-2x+1=292$, so we want to write $x^6-2x^5+2x^3-2x+1 \\equiv 292 \\mod 7$.\nThe following are equivalent: $x^6-2x^5+2x^3-2x+1 \\equiv 292 \\mod 7 \\\\ x^6-2x^5+2x^3-2x+1 \\equiv 5 \\mod 7 \\\\ x^5(x-2)+2x^3-2x+1 \\equiv 0 \\mod 7 \\\\ x^5(x-2)+2x(x^2-1)+1 \\equiv 0 \\mod 7 \\\\ (x+1)(x^4-2x^3+2x^2+x-1) \\equiv 0 \\mod 7 \\\\ x+1=0 \\text{ or }x^4-2x^3+2x^2+x-1 \\equiv 0 \\mod 7$\n### Case 1: the first expression\nThe expression $x^4-2x^3+2x^2+x-1$ has degree $4$, which is greater than the degree of $7$. The polynomials $f(x)=x^4-2x^3+2x^2+x-1$ and $g(x)=7x^2-4x+1$ are equivalent $\\mod 7$, since they are symmetric functions, and their difference is divisible by $x^2$ by the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Hence, if $x^4-2x^3+2x^2+x-1=0 \\mod 7$, then $7|f(x)$, i.e., $7|7x^2-4x+1$. In particular, $4x-1 \\equiv 0 \\mod 7$ i.e., $x=6\\mod7$.\n",
        "  So we are given the equation $x^6-2x^5+2x^3-2x+1=292$. Since $292$ is quite simple, I think it\u2019s easier if we first factor out $1$. Therefore, we have\n\\begin{align*}\nx^6-2x^5+2x^3-2x+1 &= 292\\\\\n1&=x^6-2x^5+2x^3-2x+292-292\\\\\n&= x^5(x-2)+x^3(2x-1)-1(x-2)\\\\\n&= (x^5-x^3+1)(x-2)\n\\end{align*}\nThis suggests us to think about ways to factor $x^6-2x^5+2x^3-2x+1$, one which includes $x-2$ as a factor. One way to factor a quintic expression is to make a quadratic supplement of it, i.e., to consider the polynomial $(x^4-x^3+1)+(ax+b)$. Here, $x^4-x^3+1$ is the base polynomial; $ax+b$ is the polynomial that should assure the desired factors to appear. We have\n\\begin{align*}\n(x^4-x^3+1)+(ax+b)&=x^5+x(a-1)+b+1\\\\\n\\end{align*}As we want to get rid of $x^5$, if we set $a=2$, then we have\n\\begin{align*}\nx^5+x(2-1)+b+1&=x^5+2x+b+1\\\\\n&=x^5-x^3+2x+b+1\n\\end{align*}The next step is to transform $x^6-2x^5+2x^3-2x+1$ into the form we got just now. I want to get rid of the term $x^4$ to make the second term $x^5(x-2)$ arise. In order to subtract a term of $x^4$, we take the difference between\n\\begin{align*}\nx^6-2x^5+2x^3-2x+1\n\\end{align*}and $x^6+ax^4$, and we require that the term",
        " First of all, we know that\n$$x^6-2x^5+2x^3-2x+1=(x^6-2x^5+x^4+x^4-2x^3+2x^3-2x+1)=((x-1)^2(x^4-2x^3+x^2+x^2+1))$$It looks like it might be easier to solve.\nSo we are left with\n$$(x^4-2x^3+x^2+x^2+1)=288$$\nPLIT $\\frac{a}{b}$ for 288 into productions\n288=288*0.001 so ($x^4-2x^3+x^2+x^2+1$)=288*0.001\n288*0.001=2880001/10000000\nafter this try the value of x here $x(who)-\u0446\u043e\u0432$\n### Corneil Reply: We know $288 = 16 \\cdot 18 = 2^4 \\cdot 3^2$, so\n$$(x^4-2x^3+x^2+x^2+1) = 288 = 2^7 \\cdot 3^2.$$Since this is only a quadratic expression, we can easily factor to find\n$$x^4-2x^3+x^2+x^2+1=(x^2-1)^2=(x-1)(x+1)^2.$$Hence, we have\n$$0=(x-1)(x^2+2x+1)$$which factors easily to\n$$0=(x-1)(x+1)^2=(x-1)(x+1)(x+1).$$Finally, the two roots of the quadratic expression are $x = 1$ and $x = -1$, and of these, only $x = \\boxed{1}$ is an integer solution. Thus, $x = 1$ is the correct solution.\n### 288 value in Formula\nKVC (Karol Cruz Moreno)\nTo get 288, we need to use $x=2$.\nAlso, no need to calculate while we have\n2880 = 2 to the power of 4 * 3 to the power of 2.\nfor this easiest way convert 288/1.

        " Final Answer: The final answer is 2. I hope it is correct.\nLet\u2019s rewrite the equation:\n$$\\left(x^3-1\\right)^2-\\left(2x^3\\right) = 292 \\tag 1$$.\n$$(x^3 -1)^2 - 2x^3 = 292$$.\n$$(x^3 -1)^2 - x^3 = 292$$.\n$$(x^3 -1)(x^3 -1) - x^3 = 292$$.\n128 - x^3 = 292.\nSo we get $x^3 = 128 - 292$ or $x^3 = -164$.\nNow we don\u2019t know what is $x^3$ but we know that $x^6-2x^5+2x^3-2x+1=292$.\nTo find $x$ we have to divide $x^3$ by 2, we get $x^3/2$ and then find out x.\nNow we get $x^3/2 = -82$ so $x = \\pm \\sqrt[3]{-82}$.\n### Additional: A More Efective Use Of Solving The Cubic Equation:\nSince $x^6-2x^5+2x^3-2x+1=292$, the solutions of the cubic equation $x^3-2x^2+2x-1=0$ must satisfy $x^6-2x^5+2x^3-2x+1=292$. Now by applying Descartes\u2019 rule, there are only 1 real solution of the cubic equation (the question doesn\u2019t say the solutions are real, but it might be situations where being limiting the possible solutions with a small scope makes finding solutions much more easier.\nBy writing $a(x)$ as $a(x)=x^3-2x^2+2x-1$ and then calculating the discriminant $Disc(a)$, we can get the value of roots.\nLet us know if you have any questions.\nThank you for using Chegg Study today.
