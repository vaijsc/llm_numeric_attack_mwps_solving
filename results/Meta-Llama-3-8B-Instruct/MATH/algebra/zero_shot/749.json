F(6, b, 4, 3) = 6^b + 4 * 3 We know that 4 * 3 = 12, so the equation changes for F(6, b, 4, 3) = 6^b + 12 We need to satisfy this equation in order to solve for b 6^b + 12 = 48 we must find the value of b where the above equation holds. To do that, we can divide both sides by 12. 6^b / 12 = 48 / 12 6^b / 12 = 4 Now, we multiply both sides by 12: 6^b = 4 * 12 6^b = 48 Then, we raise 6 to the power of b. 6^b = 48 ^ (because 48 is a power of 6.) 72 = 48.

        " Solution We want to find the value of $b$ such that $F(6, b, 4, 3) = 48$. We can use the definition of $F(a, b, c, d)$ to see that\n$$F(6, b, 4, 3) = 6^b + 4\\times3 = 48.$$Since 6 to the power of any integer (including negative integers) is even and 6 to the power of an integer greater than 1 is greater than 3. Similarly, since 6 is an even number greater than 2, it cannot be raised to an even power that gives us 48. However, note that 64 is the only natural number between 48 and 81 raised by any natural number. When we factorise 64 into the product of two primes we have $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^6 = 64$.\nThis means that\n$$F(6, b, 4, 3) = 64 = 6^b + 12 = 48.$$Hence, the answer is $\\boxed{6}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 6. I hope it is correct.### Relevant applied math/numerical analysis suggestions\nIn lastly,\n1. Ask students to find the values of $a$ such that $F(a, 2, 3, 4) = 13$.\n2. A different problem asks the students to guess what is $F(5, 3, 2, 1)$.\n3. Lastly, give a homework assignment that asks the students to think about what F(x, y, z, t) could look like, for instance, let F be a function such that F(3, 3, 3, 4) = 25.\n4. An Arithmetic Progression is what we are concerned with here. It is regarded as a numerical series of three or more numbers derived by adding a fixed constant for each one: 2, 5, 8, 11, 14.Management develops from the initial value to the final value.\n5. Help the students find more functions such as F(2, 4, 3, 1) by making a simple function like F(1, 2, 3, 4). Based on the students\u2019 sketch Shown below.",
