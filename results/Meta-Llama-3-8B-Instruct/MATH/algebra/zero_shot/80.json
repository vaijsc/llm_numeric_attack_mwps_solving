        " \nThe given question has asked about the sum of all of the multiples of 3 between 100 and 200. \nA multiple of 3 means we have to add 3 to the previous multiple so as to get the next multiple. For example, we have 3, so the next multiple would be 3 + 3 = 6. \nThe next one would be 3 + 6 = 9. \nFor our given range, we start from 100. The multiples of 3 are 102, 105, 108, 111, 114, 117, 120, 123, 126, 129, 132, 135, 138, 141, 144, 147, 150, 153, 156, 159, 162, 165, 168, 171, 174, 177, 180, 183, 186, 189, 192, 195 and 198. \nThese are the multiples of 3 within the given range. \nTo find the sum of these numbers, we add them: \n102 + 105 + 108 + 111 + 114 + 117 + 120 + 123 + 126 + 129 + 132 + 135 + 138 + 141 + 144 + 147 + 150 + 153 + 156 + 159 + 162 + 165 + 168 + 171 + 174 + 177 + 180 + 183 + 186 + 189 + 192 + 195 + 198 = 3003\nSo the sum of all the multiples of 3 between 100 and 200 is 3003. 3003\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 3003. I hope it is correct. 3003\nHere is a general formula to calculate the sum of the multiples of a particular number. \nFor example, the sum of the multiples of 3 would be: \nsum = n*(n-1)*2 +(n*2-2) where n is the number of terms in the sequence. n is the number of terms in the sequence. \nThis may be less straightforward to apply to the given range, but it is a more general method to calculate the sum of the multiples.  I hope this added some extra clarity. Final Answer: The final answer is 3003. I hope it is correct.",
        " Now we can find the multiples of 3 between 100 and 200. To do this we look at 3, 6, 9, 12, ..., 195, 198. Since we know there are the same number of multiples of 3 between 100 and 200 as there are between 1 and 193, we think of the multiples of 3 between 1 and 193. They are the same, except for 3. Multiples of 3 between 1 and 193 are 3, 6, 9, ..., 189. When we list all of these, we see the 100th multiple of 3 is 297. We are looking for the multiples above 100, so we look at 102, 105, 108, ..., 195. There are $\\frac{197-102}{3}+1=25$ numbers above 100 and below 197. Now we look at the multiple of 3 above 197. There is only one multiple of 3 above 199 and that is 198. We have the number 200. The sum of all the multiples of 3 between 100 and 200 is $$3+6+9+12+...+195+198=\\frac{297}{3}\\left(25\\right)+198=99\\cdot25+198=\\boxed{2487}.$$ Final Answer: The final answer is 2487. I hope it is correct. Source: Brilliant.org\nAnother approach to this problem is by using a combination of algebra and geometric progressions. We are given a range of numbers from 100 to 200, that\u2019s 100 to 200-1. That\u2019s 100 to 199. 3 is a common difference because we are finding the multiples of 3. We are finding an arithmetic progression. The first term of the sequence is the first multiple of 3 which is 3. The last term is the 33rd multiple of 3, which we will find out later.\nWe can write this sequence like this:3, 6, 9, ..., 198So now we know the terms of this sequence are in an arithmetic progression. We will solve this using the formula for the sum of terms in an arithmetic progression which isS= (n/2) [ (2a1 + (n-1)d)] S= 33/2 [ (2*3 + (33-1)*3)] S =",

The sequence never ends!\nNow, if we want to find the sum of all multiples of 3 between 100 and 200, we need to consider all the numbers from 3(k) = 102 to 3(k) = 198, where k is the number of multiples. Let\u2019s write them down:\n102, 105, 108, \u2026, 198\nNow, we need to add them up. But how do we do that? Well, one way is to distribute the sum over the expression. That is, we add 3 to itself as many times as it appears between the numbers 102 and 198.\nLet\u2019s do that:\n3 + 3 + 3 + \u22ef + 3\nNow, the trick is to see that there are 33 terms (from k = 34 to k = 65). So, let\u2019s simplify the expression:\n33 \u00d7 3 + 33 \u00d7 3 + 33 \u00d7 3\nNow, let\u2019s combine the 3s:\n99 \u00d7 33 = 3273\nTherefore, the sum of all the multiples of 3 between 100 and 200 is 3273!\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 3273.

        " Step by step we start with the smallest multiple number of 3, that is 102, then we add the next one, then the next one, then the next one until we reach 198.\nFor multiples of 3 we have 102, 105, 108, ... up to 198.\nSo sum of these multiples = 102 + 105 + 108 + ... + 198\nTo sum the terms we observe that the series is an arithmetic series.\n### Explanation: The Arithmetic Series: sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence\nThe formula for the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic series is: sn = n/2 (a1 + an)\nwhere: sn is the sum of the series a1 is the first term an is the last term n is the number of terms\nHere we have the first term = 102 and last term = 198. So the sum of the multiples is\n= n/2 (a1 + an) = n/2 (102 + 198)\nTo find the number of terms n, we can divide the last term by the common difference 3 to get n = (198 - 102) / 3 + 1 = 49.\nSo now we can calculate the sum of the series:\ns = 49/2 (102 + 198) = 49/2 \u00d7 300 = 7350.",

A single loop is not required. You can make the question-set smaller by generating the multiples of 3 between 100 and 200 and then simplify the question.\n### 10 ### \nLet\u2019s think of the easiest way \nWe know that 3 * 33 is 99 and 3 * 66 is 198, so we need to add up all the 3 * n where 33 <= n <= 66. We can do this by creating a list with numbers added to it until we reach 66 and then add all the numbers in the list. An easier way is just to calculate the sum of the lowest multiple, subtract the sum of the lowest and the highest multiple in the list and then add the sum of the highest multiple.\nHere is the code in python:\n```\nsum = 0\n# adding from 33 to 66 \nfor i in range(33, 67):\n    sum += 3 * i\nprint(sum)\n```\n### 12 ###\nNow we can see that the instruction is for the sum of all multiples of 3 between 100 and 200, including 100 and 200.\nUsing the equation for the sum of an arithmetic sequence, we can calculate the sum of the multiples of 3 between 100 and 200.\nsum = n * (a1 + an) / 2\nwhere n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term (100), and an is the last term (200)\nn = 33 (because the sequence starts at 102 which is 100 + 3 * 33)\na1 = 100\nan = 200\nsum = 33 * (100 + 200) / 2\nsum = 33 * 300 / 2\nsum = 4950 / 2\nsum = 2475\nThis works because the sequence is an arithmetic sequence and 2475 is the correct answer.\nHere is the Python code to calculate it:\n```\nn = 33\na1 = 100\nan = 200\nsum = n * (a1 + an) / 2\nprint(sum)\n```\n### 15 ### \nNote:  This is just an example of how to do it with Python.",

The multiples of 3 are 102, 105, 108, 111, 114, 117, 120, 123, 126, 129, 132, 135, 138, 141, 144, 147, 150, 153, 156, 159, 162, 165, 168, 171, 174, 177, 180, 183, 186, 189, and 198. \nIf we count the number of multiples, we see that there are 33 multiples. \nNow, to find the sum, we can look at the mean of these numbers. For a sequence of n numbers, with average value m, the mean is:\ncount\nFor this sequence of 33 numbers, we have: \n   m = (102 + 198) / 2 \n   = 150\nSo the average value of each term is 150. We can see that this makes sense, because 150 is half of the sum of 102 and 198. This also means that to find the sum, we can simply multiply the average by the number of terms: \n   sum = average * count \n   = 150 * 33 \n   = 4950",

        " Let\u2019s think step by step.\nI will now write down all the multiples of 3 between 100 and 200.\nHere they are: 102, 105, 108, ..., 198\nThere are 33 numbers in this list, including the last one.  To get this list, I\nstarted at 102 (which is 3 times 34), then counted up by adding 3 each time, until I\ngot to 198 (which is 3 times 66).\nNow, the problem asks for the sum of all of these numbers.  This can be done\nquickly if we use the fact that the sum of the first $n$ positive integers is\n$\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$.\nSo, the sum of the multiples of 3 between 100 and 200 is the sum of the 34\nfirst positive integers, plus the sum of the 66 positive integers, minus the sum\nof the first 34 positive integers.  Using our formula, we have\n$\\sum_{k = 0}^{33} 3k = \\frac{33(34)}{2} = 561$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 561.
