        " Important equations to start with \nIf we have a quadratic equation (for example, $ax^2+bx+c=0$) with constant $a, b,$ and $c$ and the $x$ coordinate is also the only variable, it would have two solutions which are the solutions of the equation. This does not apply in this case. Because, the given equation has no power of $x$ higher than $1$.\n### Simplifying |x-4|-10=2 Essential equation\nThe equation is essential in the form of |x-4|-10=2. The purpose is to simplify further by the well-known property of modulus |.|\n$$|x-4|-10=2\\,...$$\nModule subtraction is allowed because it does not change the true value of the equation.

It is mandatory.)\n  \nBy the property of modulus, we only have two cases:\n$-10+2=|x-4|$\n$10-2=|x-4|$\nCase 1: $|x-4|=8$\nThis will involve all and not lost the result of $x$ of the modulus result as the input. The modulus result can be $-x+4=-8$, $x-4=-8$, which means $x=4-8=x=-4$ Another modulus result could be $x-4=8$, which means $x=4+8=x=12$\nCase 2: $|x-4|=12$\nThis should be involved and it should not be lost the result as $x$ as modulus result. That modulus result will be $-x+4=-12$, $x-4=-12$, which means $x=4-12=x=-8$ Another modulus result could be $x-4=12$, $x=4+12=x=16$\nFinal step\nCombine all the given results: The total solutions will be $x=-8$ and $x=12$.

        " Let\u2019s think step by step.\nThe equation $|x-4| - 10 = 2$ can be rewritten as $|x-4| = 12$. This equation describes the distance between the point $x$ and the point 4 from both sides. It means we are looking for the points that are at a distance of 12 from 4.\nSince the equation is $|x-4| = 12$, we are dealing with a distance. We know that the distance from a point $a$ to a point $b$ is either $a-b$ or $b-a$, depending on whether $a$ is to the left of $b$ or to the right. We have to determine which of the two possibilities holds for us.\nBecause $|x-4| = 12$, we know that either $x-4 = 12$ or $4-x = 12$.  If $x-4=12$, then $x=16$, which means that $x$ is to the right of 4.  If $4-x=12$, then $x= -8$, which means that $x$ is to the left of 4.\nThis means that we are looking for the points that are either 16 units to the right of 4 or 8 units to the left of 4.

        " \nLet us evaluate the equation $|x-4| - 10 = 2.$\nWe get $$|x-4| = 12.$$ This tells us that the distance from $x$ to 4 is 12.\nThere are two possibilities. Either $x$ is 16, so we have $x = 16,$ or $x$ is 4 units below 16, so we have $x = -4$.\nTherefore, the product of the possible values of $x$ is $16\\cdot(-4)=\\boxed{-64}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -64. I hope it is correct.  A 3-year-old could have figured this one out.  You could have arrived at the same solution by recognizing that the difference of $x$ and $4$ is always a power of $2$.

        " \nGiven $|x-4| -10 = 2$, add 10 on both sides to get $|x-4|=12$.\nNow, $|x-4|=12$ is equivalent to $x-4 = 12$ or $-(x-4)=12$, so $x=16$ or $x=2$.\nNow let\u2019s calculate their product. $x$ must be either $16\\cdot2=32$ or $2\\cdot16=32$, so the answer is $\\boxed{32}$. \nWhen faced with a question that involves giving a definite numerical answer, we should be ready to calculate the numerical value of the desired quantity in order to arrive at the correct answer. In this case, because there are only two possible values of $x$, we could have easily rearranged the equation to find the possible values of $x$, without bothering to resort to thinking of $|x-4| -10$ as being equivalent to $|x-4|$, as this approach does.\nIn the equation $|x-4| -10 = 2$, what is the product of all possible values of $x$?\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 32.

The function eval() parses the expression passed to this method and executes Python expression whether it\u2019s a single statement or a string of multiple Python statements.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 32.

Georgia Tech Spring 2003, Problem Set #5 Hit enter key when done: View available problems. Problem 1: Consider the equation |x-4| - 10 = 2. Find all possible values of x, and compute their product. Solution: Subtracting 2 from both sides, we have |x-4| = 12. There are two possible cases, depending on whether x - 4 is positive or negative.  If x - 4 is positive, then x-4=12, which implies that x=16.  If x - 4 is negative, then x-4=-12, which implies that x=8.  Therefore, the two possible values of x are 8 and 16.

        " \n1. First, we simplify the given equation by adding 10 to both sides:\n$$|x-4| = 12.$$ \nThis will isolate the absolute value expression.\n2. Now, let\u2019s think about when the absolute value expression could be 12.  The absolute value expression will be 12 when $x-4$ is 12 or less than -12.  The expression $|x-4|$ describes the distance from $x$ to 4, so we could think about it like this: when the distance from $x$ to 4 is 12, we get either that $x$ is 16 (because 16-4 = 12) or that $x$ is 8 (because 8-4 = -4). \n3. So, we consider the 2 possibilities: that $x$ is 16, and that $x$ is 8.  Split the given equation into 2 simpler equations, one for each possibility:\n\\begin{align*}\n|x-4| = 12\\quad &\\Rightarrow\\quad |16-4| = 12\\quad &\\Rightarrow\\quad 12 &= 12\\qquad\\qquad(\\text{True}),\\\\\n|x-4| = 12\\quad &\\Rightarrow\\quad |-8-4| = 12\\quad &\\Rightarrow\\quad 12 &= -4\\qquad\\qquad(\\text{False}).\n\\end{align*}\nNotice that only the first case is true, so $x$ is only 16.\n4.
