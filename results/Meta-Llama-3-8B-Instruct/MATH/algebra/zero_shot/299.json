        " $$ 2^{x+2} = 32 = 2^5 $$. So $x+2 = 5$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 3. I hope it is correct.\nThe equation $2^{x+2}=32$ implies that $2^{x+2}=2^5$, which in turns implies that $x+2=5$, so $x=3$. The solution is hence $\\boxed{3}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 3. I hope it is correct.  If there isn't one, try solving for any variable that appears in the equation. Let\u2019s look at a specific example: $$ 2^{x + 2} = 32 $$ The equation essentially tells us that 2 is being raised to some power and that its value is equal to some number, specifically 32. Well, 2 raised to the power of 5 equals 32. Right, there it is.\nSo we have $2^{5}$, which we know equals 32. That means $x+2$ must be 5 because of the function. Adding two to that, we get 5, which means $x$ must equal 3.\n### Hence, the solution is x = 3. 32 = 2^5 The problem is resolved; the response is $x=3$. Since $2^{x + 2} = 2^5$, we have that $x + 2 = 5$. Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get $x = 3$, and the solution is $\\boxed{3}$. Final Answer: The final answer is 3. I hope it is correct. 2^{x+2} = 2^5 we get x+2 = 5 now subtract 2 from both sides get x=3. Therefore, the answer is x=3. We can rewrite 2^{x+2} = 32 as 2^{x+2} = 2^5. This gives us that x+2 = 5, or x = 3. So x = 3 is a solution. It is the only one, i.e., the equation has only one solution.  We can rewrite the equation as $2^{x+2} = 2^5$. This leads to $x+2 = 5$. We can now subtract 2 from both sides to get $x = 3$. Therefore,",
        " 3\nWe know 32=2^5. We also know that the exponent of the base of the equation is 2 more than the unknown integer (here denoted by x). Therefore, the equation translates to:\n2^{x+2}=2^5.\nFor the exponents to be equal, we need the indices to be equal as well, i.e. x+2=5. We get that x=3. So, the correct response is 3. That is, x satisfying the equation is 3. Are you using it because it is 2 more? Why cannot you use some other number rather than 2 in the question?\nMany might say 3 is a good answer because the question tells us x+2 and we're told 2^5=32. We might have to get the value of x+2 first. This equation for solution 3, can be written as 2^(x+2)=2^5 or simply as 2^x=2^3. The power of the base is always equal in order for the equation to be true. So 3 equals x. So the correct solution is 3. The 3 might have coincidentally been related to 2 but we ended on 3 as our answer though!\nLet's go back to 2^x=2^5. We are told we are working with base 2 here.\nNow we finalise with examining the bases given to us. Our exponents here are equal. In order for the equation 2^x=2^5 to work out, x must also equal 5.\nOf course, we're told the base 32 is related to 2^5. Login. \nWhat we have been given here is \"integer x satisfies the equation: 2^{x + 2} = 32\". So we need an integer which must be 5, not 3.\nHere is the step-by-step answer for the solution:\n1. Write the equation 2^{x + 2} = 32.\n2. Think about the powers of 2. Right now, we don't know the value of 2x but we know 2x + 2 from the left-hand side.\n2^3 = 8\n2^4 = 16\n2^5 = 32\n3. As we observe some values of 2, we find that 2^5 = 32.\n4. In order for the equation to",
        " \nThe first step is to identify the base and exponent. They are $2$ and $x + 2$, respectively.\n### Step 2: Apply the Rule of Exponent.\nSince we have $x + 2$ in the exponent, I tighten up and use the rule of exponent to simplify $2^{x+2}$, we have the following:\n$2^{x + 2} = 2 \\times 2^x = 2^{x+1}.$\n### Step 3: Apply the Property of Exponents.\nNow we can rewrite this expression as equal to $2^5$ using the fact that $32 = 2^5$.\n### Step 4: Set up the Equation and Solve for x.\nSo, we now have: $2^5 = 2^{x + 1}.$ Equating the exponents, we see that $x + 1 = 5.$\n### Solution: \nSo, the solution to the equation is $\\boxed{x=4}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is x=4.
