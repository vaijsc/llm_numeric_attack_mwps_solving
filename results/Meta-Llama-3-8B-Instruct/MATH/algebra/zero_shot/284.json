Julien\n### Remark:\nJulien, your explanation is good. However, I would like to add that sometime the substitution of $x = h$ into the original function could also give us an idea of what is $k$.\nIn this case, if we let $x = 1$, we have:\n\\begin{align*}\n-2x^2 + 4x + 5 &= -2 + 4 + 5\\\\\n&= 7.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, we also get that $k = 7$.  In this case, both ways of finding $k$ give us the same answer, which is 5.  However, it is always important to know that there are different methods to get to the same answer.\nThis will help us to build more creative and well-rounded mathematicians. I believe that our students should learn different ways of solving problems, not just rely on one particular method.  By the way, how would you handle the case of a quadratic polynomial that has no $x^2$ term? For example, how would you express $3x+7$ in the form $a(x-h)^2+k$?  That is an interesting question! ",

Cheers!NOPQR\n### Explanation: \nThe trickiest part about this question is that we should know how to expand $(x-k)^2$ when $k\\neq 0$. Just like we can rewrite $a(x-h)^2$ as $a(x^2-2hx+h^2)$, we can also rewrite $(x-k)^2$ as $x^2-2kx+k^2$. (Just think about the square of a sum: $(x+k)^2=(x+k)(x+k)=x^2+2kx+k^2$. Now take the difference between $x+k$ and $x$, and you will get $-k$, which could be $-2$.\nSo, to make $-2$ the coefficient of $x^2$, we need $-2$ to be our $-2k$ in $(x-k)^2$. So, $k = 1$. Include this $k=1$ into our expression to make $a(x-h)^2+k$ be $(x-1)^2$ and $k=7$, so our answer is $\\boxed{7}$. It is really easy to get confusable, because we have to remember that $k$ is the value of $y$ when $x=0$. Therefore, $\\boxed{k=7}$. This is the trickiest part about this question.\nThis is my solution. There are smart people who can solve this more quickly than me. I hope this helps. Stay healthy andfocused.

        " \nWe want to write $-2x^2+4x+5$ as $a(x-h)^2+k$, where $a$, $h$, and $k$ are constants.\nRecall the difference-of-squares formula:  $$a(x-h)^2+k=ax^2-2ahx+a(h)^2+k,$$ which is what we want to compare our expression too.\nWe set each term equal and compare.  If we do this, we see that\n$-2$ must be $a$, 4 must be $-2ah$, and 5 must be $a(h)^2+k$.  We want to pick values for $a$ and $h$ which make the above equations true, and then we can find $k$.\n$-2ah=4\\Rightarrow h=-2.$  $a(h)^2+k=5\\Rightarrow a(-2)^2+k=5\\Rightarrow a+k=5.$\nSince we also know that $a=-2$, we have $-2+k=5\\Rightarrow k=\\boxed{7}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 7. I hope it is correct.  It can be a good approach if we have a lot of experience in factoring.  Here are the additional tips you may find helpful: In the initial expression, notice that there is no negative sign in front of the $x$.  Because of that, the easiest way to get an expression with no $x$ terms other than $x$ (that is, no multiple/combination of $x$ with itself), is to multiply the $x$ by a 1/2, then square all the terms in the expression.  That is what the $x^2+2x$ terms in the factoring are meant to do.  Then factor by grouping based on the possibilities that we get back to what we started with, but factored.\nHope it helps.  You can also add this as a hint in your assessment.  If someone claims it\u2019s the first to solve it without using graphing calculator, just ask them to write down manually the expansion of $(x-2)^2+7$.  That will give them what you want.

        " \nStep 1: Find $a$. Expand $a(x - h)^2 + k$.\n\\begin{align*}\na(x-h)^2+k &= a(x^2-2hx+h^2)+k\\\\\n&=ax^2-2ahx+ah^2+k.\n\\end{align*}Set this equal to $-2x^2+4x+5$.\n\\begin{align*}\nax^2-2ahx+ah^2+k &=-2x^2+4x+5\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad ax^2-2ahx+ah^2+k+2x^2&=4x+5\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad(a+2)x^2-2ahx+ah^2+k&=4x+5.\n\\end{align*}We see that $a+2$ should be equal to $-2$, so $a=-2$. This gives us\n$$-2x^2-2hx+h^2+k=4x+5.$$\n### Next Steps: \nStep 2: Find $h$. Set $-2x^2-2hx+h^2+k=4x+5$.\n\\begin{align*}\n-2x^2-2hx+h^2+k &= 4x+5\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad -2hx+h^2+k &= 4x+5+2x^2\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad (-2h)x+(h^2+k) &= 2x^2+4x+5\n\\end{align*}We can equate coefficients. The $x^2$ coefficients are equal, so $2=h^2$. Therefore, $h=\\pm\\sqrt{2}$. The $x$ coefficients are equal, so $-2h=4$, and therefore, $h=-2$. Hence, $k$ does not depend on $h$, so we choose the positive value for $h$ to be $\\sqrt{2}$.\nStep 3: Find $k$. Continue to equate coefficients.\n\\begin{align*}\n-2h &= 4\\\\\n-h^2 &= -4\\\\\n-k &= 5\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad k&= 5.\n\\end{align*}We conclude that $k=\\boxed{5}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 5",

        " First, we will change the expression by subtracting the $h$ which is $(h^2 - a)$. Doing so, we will get \\begin{align*}\na(x - h)^2 + k &= a(x - h)^2 + k\\\\\n&= a(x^2-2hx + h^2) + k\\\\\n&= ax^2-2ahx + ah^2+k.\n\\end{align*}\n### "
