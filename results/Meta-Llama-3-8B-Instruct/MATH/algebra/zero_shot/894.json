        "To find the range of the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{1-x} \\), we can analyze it step by step.\n1. **Identify the domain**: The first step is to determine the values of \\( x \\) for which \\( f(x) \\) is defined. The function \\( f(x) \\) has a denominator of \\( 1-x \\). This denominator cannot be zero, so we set up the inequality:\n   \\[\n   1 - x \\neq 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x \\neq 1\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the domain of \\( f(x) \\) is \\( x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{1\\} \\).\n2. **Analyze the function behavior**: Next, we will examine how the function behaves as \\( x \\) approaches various values, particularly near the point where it is undefined:\n   - As \\( x \\) approaches \\( 1 \\) from the left (i.e., \\( x \\to 1^- \\)), \\( 1 - x \\) approaches \\( 0 \\), making \\( f(x) \\) go to positive infinity:\n     \\[\n     \\lim_{x \\to 1^-} f(x) = \\lim_{x \\to 1^-} \\frac{1}{1-x} = +\\infty\n     \\]\n   - As \\( x \\) approaches \\( 1 \\) from the right (i.e., \\( x \\to 1^+ \\)), \\( 1 - x \\) becomes a small negative number, making \\( f(x) \\) go to negative infinity:\n     \\[\n     \\lim_{x \\to 1^+} f(x) = \\lim_{x \\to 1^+} \\frac{1}{1-x} = -\\infty\n     \\]\n3. **Consider the limits as \\( x \\) approaches the extremes**: We also check the limits of \\( f(x) \\) as \\( x \\) goes to \\( \\infty \\) and \\( -\\infty \\):\n   - As \\( x \\to \\infty \\):\n     \\[\n     f(x) = \\frac{1}{1 - x} \\to 0^- \\quad (\\text{since } 1 - x \\to -\\infty)\n     \\]\n   - As \\( x \\to -\\infty \\):\n     \\[\n     f(x) = \\frac{1}{1 - x} \\to 0^+ \\quad (\\text{since } 1 - x \\to +\\infty)\n     \\]\n   Thus, as \\( x \\) tends to either positive or negative infinity, \\( f(x) \\) approaches \\( 0 \\) (but never reaches it).\n4. **Determine the range**: From the analysis above, we see that:\n   - As \\( x \\to 1^- \\), \\( f(x) \\to +\\infty \\).\n   - As \\( x \\to 1^+ \\), \\( f(x) \\to -\\infty \\).\n   - As \\( x \\to -\\infty\\), \\( f(x) \\to 0^+ \\).\n   - As \\( x \\to +\\infty\\), \\( f(x) \\to 0^- \\).\n   Therefore, the function can take all real values except for \\( 0 \\). \nPutting this together, the range of the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{1-x} \\) is expressed in interval notation as:\n\\[\n(-\\infty, 0) \\cup (0, +\\infty)\n\\]",
        "To determine the range of the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{1-x} \\), we first need to analyze the behavior of the function as \\( x \\) varies over its domain.\n1. **Identify the Domain**: The function is defined for all \\( x \\) except where the denominator is zero. Thus, we find:\n   \\[\n   1 - x \\neq 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x \\neq 1.\n   \\]\n   The domain of \\( f(x) \\) is therefore \\( (-\\infty, 1) \\cup (1, \\infty) \\).\n2. **Analyze the Function Behavior**: Next, we examine how \\( f(x) \\) behaves as \\( x \\) approaches certain key points:\n   - As \\( x \\to 1^- \\) (approaching 1 from the left):\n     \\[\n     f(x) = \\frac{1}{1-x} \\to +\\infty.\n     \\]\n   - As \\( x \\to 1^+ \\) (approaching 1 from the right):\n     \\[\n     f(x) = \\frac{1}{1-x} \\to -\\infty.\n     \\]\n3. **Behavior at Infinity**: We also check what happens as \\( x \\) approaches \\( -\\infty \\) and \\( +\\infty \\):\n   - As \\( x \\to -\\infty \\):\n     \\[\n     f(x) = \\frac{1}{1-x} \\to \\frac{1}{\\infty} \\to 0.\n     \\]\n   - As \\( x \\to +\\infty \\):\n     \\[\n     f(x) = \\frac{1}{1-x} \\to \\frac{1}{-\\infty} \\to 0.\n     \\]\n4. **Intermediate Values**: Because \\( f(x) \\) is a continuous function (except at \\( x = 1 \\)), and it shows that as we approach 1 from the left the function goes to \\( +\\infty \\), while from the right it goes to \\( -\\infty \\), we can conclude that \\( f(x) \\) takes on all values in between. Thus, \\( f(x) \\) maps to all real numbers as \\( x \\) varies in its domain.\n5. **Complete Range**: We deduce that the function takes all real values except for the point where it equals \\( 0 \\), since both ends approach but do not touch \\( 0 \\) as \\( x \\to \\infty \\) and \\( x \\to -\\infty \\).\nSo, combining these observations, the range of the function is:\n\\[\n(-\\infty, 0) \\cup (0, +\\infty).\n\\]\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{(-\\infty, 0) \\cup (0, \\infty)}.\n\\]",

The function can be rearranged to isolate \\( y \\):\n   \\[\n   y = \\frac{1}{1-x}.\n   \\]\n   To solve for \\( x \\) in terms of \\( y \\), we can rearrange:\n   \\[\n   y(1 - x) = 1 \\implies y - yx = 1 \\implies -yx = 1 - y \\implies x = \\frac{1 - y}{y}.\n   \\]\n   The expression \\( \\frac{1 - y}{y} \\) gives us a way of writing \\( x \\) in terms of \\( y \\).\n3. **Find the restrictions on \\( y \\)**: Let's analyze the expression \\( \\frac{1 - y}{y} \\). This equation is well-defined for all \\( y \\neq 0 \\) because if \\( y = 0 \\), the right-hand side is undefined (division by zero).\n4. **Behavior as \\( y \\to 0 \\)**: If we consider the limits of \\( f(x) \\) as \\( x \\) approaches 1, we find:\n   - As \\( x \\) approaches 1 from the left (\\( x \\to 1^{-} \\)), \\( f(x) \\to \\infty \\).\n   - As \\( x \\) approaches 1 from the right (\\( x \\to 1^{+} \\)), \\( f(x) \\to -\\infty \\).\n5. **End behavior**: For very large values of \\( x \\):\n   - As \\( x \\to -\\infty\\), \\( f(x) \\) approaches \\( 0 \\) from the positive side.\n   - As \\( x \\to \\infty\\), \\( f(x) \\) approaches \\( 0 \\) from the negative side.\nFrom this analysis, we conclude that \\( f(x) \\) can take on all real values except \\( 0 \\), since there is no \\( x \\) such that \\( f(x) = 0 \\).\nTherefore, the range of the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{1-x} \\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{(-\\infty, 0) \\cup (0, \\infty)}.\n\\]",

        " $$(0,1)$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is (0,1). I hope it is correct. Determine the Domain of f(x) = 1/(1 - x) Start by setting 1 - x = 0 x = 1 Substitute it into f(x) f(1) = 1/(1 - 1) = 1/0 Which is undefined. Set the expression inside the denominator to be non zero 1 - x != 0 So 1 - x > 0 or 1 - x < 0 x < 1 OR x > 1 We can combine x < 1 and x > 1, and we get x != 1 The numerator is always +ve and will always be defined. As long as x is not equal to 1, the expression is always +ve. So the range is (0, +ve infinity) Which can be rewritten as 0 < f(x) < infinity Or we can directly read the given options. The best fit will be (0,1). That is the answer. The range is 0 < f(x) < infinity. since it does not restrict any value between 0 and 1.

The reason is that if $f(x)$ were greater than or equal to $1$, then $x$ would be equal to $1$, which is the limit of $f(x)$ from the left and the right. But this is not possible since there is no value of $x$ which makes $f(x)$ equal to $1$. So, $f(x)$ is never greater than or equal to $1$, which implies that it is less than $1$. Therefore, the range of $f(x)$ is $(0,\\infty)$. In interval notation, it is written as $(0,\\infty)$.\n### Passage: What is the range of the function $f(x) = \\frac{1}{1-x}$?\nThe function is defined for all $x$ except for $x=1$.
