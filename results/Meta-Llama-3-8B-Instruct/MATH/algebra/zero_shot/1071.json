        " There are a couple of ways to solve it, so let\u2019s do both.\n### Method 1: Split the equation into two separate equations\nLet $u=x-p$ and $v=x-q$.

Now, we can solve for $u$ by subtracting $p^2$ from both sides and then dividing by $x-q$: $$u-xq=(p^2-pq)/(x-q)\\Rightarrow u=xq+(p^2-pq)/(x-q).$$Now, note that $u$ must also equal $(r-p)$, so we have $$r-p=xq+(p^2-pq)/(x-q)\\Rightarrow pq+(x-r)q=r^2-prpq.$$Multiply both sides by $q$ to get $$pq^2+(x-r)q^2=r^2q-prpq^2.$$Add $rpq-p^2q$ to both sides to get $$pq^2-p^2q+(x-r)q^2=r^2q+rpq-p^2q-prpq^2.$$Now, use factorization to get $$(q-p)(p+r)q^2=rq-r^2pq.$$Finally, note that $q$ cannot equal zero, since then the original equation yields $-\\infty^2=-\\infty$, which is false. Therefore, we can invert each side of the equation by dividing by $q^2$ to get $$q=\\frac{r(q-p)}{p+r}.$$Now, substitute this back into one of the forms for $u$ above (for example, $u=xq+(p^2-pq)/(x-q)$).

        " \nLet\u2019s factor the left hand side $\\left(x-p\\right)\\left(x-q\\right)=x^2-\\left(p+q\\right)x+p q$.\n### Step 1:\nThe equation can be written as $x^2-\\left(p+q\\right)x+p q = \\left(r-p\\right)\\left(r-q\\right).$\n### (1)\nFactoring the right hand side, we have $x^2-\\left(p+q\\right)x+p q = r^2-\\left(p+q\\right)r+p q.$\n### Step 2:\nWe can subtract $p q$ from both sides to get $x^2-\\left(p+q\\right)x= r^2-\\left(p+q\\right)r.$\n### Step 3:\nNext, subtract $r^2$ from both sides to get $x^2-\\left(p+q\\right)x-r^2=0.$\n### Step 4:\nWe can use the quadratic formula to solve for $x$ below.\n$x=\\frac{\\left(p+q\\right)\\pm\\sqrt{\\left(p+q\\right)^2+4r^2}}{2}=\\frac{\\left(p+q\\right)\\pm\\sqrt{\\left(p+q\\right)^2+4\\left(r-p\\right)\\left(r-q\\right)}}{2}$\n### Step 5:\nWe can simplify the expression inside the square root. Notice that $\\left(r-p\\right)\\left(r-q\\right)=r^2-rp-rq+p q-rp=q p-o r$.\n### Finishing:\nWe can now write the final solution $x=\\frac{\\left(p+q\\right)\\pm\\sqrt{\\left(p+q\\right)^2+4\\left(r^2-rp-rq+p q-rp\\right)}}{2}=\\frac{\\left(p+q\\right)\\pm\\sqrt{\\left(p+q\\right)^2-4pr+4 pq+4rq}}{2}=\\boxed{\\frac{\\left(p+q\\pm\\sqrt{\\left(p+q\\right)^2-4\\left(p-r\\right)\\left(q-r\\right)}\\right)}{2}}.$\n### End: \nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\frac{\\left(p+q\\pm\\sqrt{\\left(p+q\\right)^2-4\\left(p-r\\",
        " I think that $x=p$ and $x=q$ are also solutions. In fact, we have $$(x-p)(x-q)=(r-p)(r-q)=r^2-(p+q)r+p q=0$$ so $(x^2-(p+q)x+pq) -(x^2-(p+q)r+prq) =0$, i.e., $(x-r)(x-p)=0$, which is just what we wanted.  Thus we have found the three solutions to the equation. In particular, the other solution in terms of $p$, $q$, and $r$ is $x=\\boxed{p}$.\n### Feedback: Great!
