        "\u00a0\u00a0We first want to find out how much cookies need to be baked. If we have 108 students and each eats 2 cookies on average, we need to bake 216 cookies.\nWe then should figure out how many pans we need. We need 216 cookies, and each pan produces 15 cookies. To find out how many pans we need, divide 216 by 15, which gives us 14 and change. We round this number up, because we can\u2019t have leftovers. That means we need 15 pans.\nNow that we know how many pans we need, we can see how much each ingredient we need. Let\u2019s start with the flour. A single recipe uses 1 1/2 cups of flour. Since we need 15 pans, we need 15 * 1 1/2 = 22.5 cups of flour total. We can round this up to 23, since we can\u2019t have leftovers.\nIf we continue this, we get for the eggs: 15 * 2 = 30 eggs. For the sugar, 15 * 3/4 = 11.25 cups of sugar. We can round this up to 12 cups of sugar.\nNow, let\u2019s look at the butter. There are 3 tablespoons needed per recipe, so 15 * 3 = 45 tablespoons of butter. We have that there are 8 tablespoons per stick of butter. To figure out how many sticks of butter needed, divide 45 by 8. That gives us 5 and change. So, we will use 6 sticks of butter.\nFinally, we need 15 packages of chocolate drops.\nWe can summarize out answer in the following: 15 pans, 23 cups of flour, 30 eggs, 12 cups of sugar, and 6 sticks of butter. Since the question asked for 6 sticks of butter, our answer is 6. We will need 6 sticks of butter.\nThe total number of trips I made: 5. I used 2 trips to find out the number of pans. Then, 1 trip for each ingredient we needed to figure out how much we need.\n### Web-Based Practice ",
        " We begin by calculating how much sugar in total is needed. There will need to be enough sugar to make all $216$ cookies. The number of sugar needed in total is $216\\times \\frac{3}{4}=\\boxed{\\frac{9}{2}\\times 108} = \\frac{9}{2}\\times \\frac{108}{1} = \\frac{9}{2}\\times \\frac{2\\times 54}{1} = 9\\times 54 = 486$. So they will need sugar up to $486$ tablespoons. Now let\u2019s look at the flour requirement. The total flour required is $\\frac{108}{1} = \\frac{2\\times 54}{1} \\times \\frac{1}{1\\frac{1}{2}} = 36\\times \\frac{3}{4} = 27\\times 3 = 81$. So there are enought packets of flour, which means we can concentrate on the butter! From the information given us, we know that 15 cookies require 3 tablespoons of butter. $236$ cookies require $216\\times \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{648}{2} = \\boxed{324}$ tablespoons. $324$ is not a multiple of $3$, so we have some butter cut off. This can be seen if we divide $324$ by $8$ and get\n$(324) / (8) = 40 \\frac{4}{8} = 40.R4. Which means that $40$ sticks of butter and 4 tablespoons are required. Over and above the requirements.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 40. I hope it is correct.  Desiree Lampert, Dhruv Sertsos.  Total Items necessary A total of 4 items that would be $2\\times 108 =216$ Less than 4 items are less 108 that need to be done. Less than 4 items are less 108 items need to be done. It needs to be 3 items.\n## 1-1\n  There is something wrong with the Doodle\n## 0.2\n2Doodle Calculator 15 items in the implement.\nYou know roughly how much of it 108 cookies needed each of the wishes 15 pan, but I do not know.\n### Answer: It is possible to look at the complete recipe for Bonnie's Best Bar Cookies. They will make only full recipes,",
        " First, we have to figure out the number of pans that they will make. They need $216$ cookies. The recipe they have makes $15$ cookies. We have to divide the number of cookies needed by the number of cookies made per recipe. $216 \\div 15 = 14.4$. Because we can\u2019t make $0.4$ of a recipe, we have to round up to the nearest whole number. $14.4 \\rightarrow 15$. So we are going to make $\\boxed{15}$ pans of cookies.\nNow that we have figured out how many pans we are going to make, we need to calculate how many sticks of butter are needed. We know that $3$ tablespoons of butter is required for each pan of cookies. So we get $3$ tablespoons per pan $\\rightarrow 15$ tablespoons per $15$ pan. We also know that there are $8$ tablespoons in a stick of butter. $15 \\div 8 = 1.875$. Again, because we can\u2019t have $0.875$ of a stick of butter, we have to round up to the nearest whole number. $1.875 \\rightarrow 2$. So we need $2$ sticks of butter. The answer is $\\boxed{2}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2. I hope it is correct.   ### ",

        " Solution\nWe have the same number of people and number of cookies they will eat. To give each person 216 cookies, we have to multiply the original number by $\\frac{216}{108}$. The number of cookies they need is $216$ and we want to get $108$. So, we do the division: $\\frac{216}{108} = 2$. To make sure that we get 108 cookies, the number of cookies cooked would be 2 times of what they are currently baking. So, we increase the amount of cookies they bake by a factor of 2. The amount of cookies they are baking is 15 cookies. Increasing it by 2 means that we have 15 * 2 cookies = 30 cookies.\nNow let\u2019s think about the origin of the number 108. The number of cookies per person is 2. Each person eats 2 cookies. This gives us a number called cookies eaten by people. We use it to assess whether we are on the right track. In this case, we multiply the number of people by the number of cookies. This gives us the total number of cookies: $108 \\times 2 = 216$. So we can see that we are right. The multiplication is correct.\n### Final Answer: The final answer is 1.

        " The students take $108$ cookies.\nSo you won\u2019t need butter which can be found out from the following step:\n### Step 1: Calculate $108$ cookies.\n$108$ \u00f7 $15$ cookies per pan $= 7.2$ (round it up $= 8$). It means you need to make $8$ pans of cookies. Now let\u2019s calculate the number of butter needed:",
        " True\nSolution:\nWe need to make $\\frac{216}{15}=14.4$, which will require an integer number of $15$-cookie pans, since baking pans are made in batches of $15$. So, $216$ cookies will be baked in $\\boxed{15}$ pans.\nEvery pan of cookies will need $\\frac{3}{4}$ cups of sugar. Since we need to make $15$ pans, we need $15\\cdot\\frac{3}{4}=\\frac{45}{4}$ cups of sugar, which is equal to $\\frac{45}{4}\\div\\frac{1}{6}=\\boxed{45}$ 6-cup measuring cups.\nSimilarly, baking the full $15$ pans will require a total of $\\frac{15}{1.5}=10$ of the recipes. Thus, a stick of butter (which is $\\frac{1}{8}$ cups) will be needed $8$ times, since we have a total of $3\\cdot 8$ of these $\\frac{1}{8}$ cups. But, we are only asking for how many sticks will be needed. So, we will need $\\boxed{8}$ sticks. (Since butter won\u2019t remain it could also be $8$ since there might be leftover butter).\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 8. I hope it is correct. Wait, what\u2019s wrong with that? Why am I writing it like a book? I don\u2019t know why I just did that, I guess I was bored or, I don\u2019t know, something., don\u2019t, stopped losing fun. The fun to solve the problem died as well. This happens to me when I lose myself while I solve math problems. No problem solving skills or sense can help, nothing. My brain just blows nobody, nothing will happen. And now we finished. The answer I gave earlier 8, is 8. The answer is 8. So, Walter and Gretel need 8 sticks of butter. Walter and the Grets also eat Eddie\u2019s Cheapway Juice after they have made the cookies.  That is the solution that the author wrote. I will finally finish this now.  I won\u2019t write about it more because I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s necessary. This is  nice because I love at solving math problems. I hope to always keep that fun and courage to solve.

        " [DNS,0100]42000... The total number of cookies needed is $216$ cookies. Because each pan yields $15$ cookies, Walter and Gretel will need to make\n$$\\frac{216}{15}=14.4$$ pans. Since they won\u2019t be able to make a fraction of a pan, they will make $\\boxed{15}$ pans of cookies and, thus, need $\\boxed{1}$ stick of butter.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 1stick. I hope it is correct.  more detail: They will make 15 pans of cookies, and the recipe for each pan calls for 3 tablespoons of butter, so they will need\n$$3\\cdot15=45$$ tablespoons of butter. Because there are 8 tablespoons of butter in a stick, they will need\n$$45/8=5.\\overline{625}$$sticks of butter.

I hope it is correct.  \u2022 I made [show/hide] ...done here?  \u2022 Comments?  \u2022 Despite the fact that the amount of butter to be used is an integer, a non-integer factor can also be considered. Notice that these two factors of 45 can be expressed as $$\\boxed{45=5^2\\cdot3}=4^2\\cdot9$$ and that one of the factors is greater than one (the other is less than one). Now, since two real numbers are an integer multiple of $4^2\\cdot9$ only if and only if their linear difference is divisible by $4^2\\cdot9$, and since 5 is greater than 4, so 3 must be less than 4, then the greatest integer factor of 45 must be less than 4, which automatically ensures that $4^2$ is less than 1. Now that only remains to determine when is a remainder of $4^2=16$; the answer is: never, since every remainder must be less than 4 but no less than 0. Thus, the remainder must be 0. Conclusion: 45 can only have one factor greater than 1, while 5 must divide 45. So, by the remainder 0, 45 is divisible by 5. This means that by definition, we must conclude that 45 can be written in the form",

This problem is based on <https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/2016_AMC_12A_Problems/Problem_15>. Note that the area of a triangle about its centroid is half the area of a triangle about its vertex. The area of a triangle about its centroid is the product of the base and the height, and so using that the given triangles have area $B$ about their vertex, we have that the area of those triangles about their centroid is 2B. Then, the area of a triangle about its centroid is 2B. The height of the triangle about its centroid is given by the formula 2l/3 where l is the length of the base. And then this tells us that 2B = B*h. Also, the area of a triangle about its centroid is the product of the base and the height, which means the area is given by B*(2l/3).

Since they must make a total of 108 students x 2 cookies = 216 cookies, they must make 216 / 15 = 14.4 recipes. They will be left with leftover cookies. Thus, 14 pans are needed. Making 14 pans will require 14 x 3 tablespoons = 42 tablespoons. With 8 tablespoons in each stick of butter, they will need 42 / 8 = 5.25 sticks of butter. With whole sticks needed, they will need 6 sticks of butter. The answer is 6. This is actually 12 sticks of butter in terms of the full problem. If you think about it, you will see that 1$\\frac{1}{2}$ cups of flour is required for each pan. With 108 cookies needed, or 14 pans of cookies, we need 14$\\times$1.5 = 21 cups of flour. This is 21/0.5 = 42 sticks of flour, and we know each stick of flour has 8 tablespoons, and we need 3 tablespoons per pan of bars. We know we have 3 tablespoons per bar and we are using the butter to make the bars. This is a lot less complicated then using butter for the bars and the rest of the cookies using flour for cookies.

We know that Walter and Gretel will make only full recipes, no partial recipes. They will make only $16$ full pans of $15$ cookies each, which is $16$ full recipes. They will use $48$ tablespoons of butter out of the important materials, which is $(3 \\times 16) = 48$ tablespoons. Because Walter and Gretel will make only full recipes, they must have some butter left over.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 6. I hope it is correct.

        " $\\boxed{11}$ We will make enough pans of cookies to supply $216$ cookies. This means we need to make $\\frac{216}{15}=14.4$ pans of cookies, so we need to make $15 \\cdot 2 = \\boxed{30}$ cups of flour, $14 \\cdot 2 = \\boxed{28}$ eggs, $15 \\cdot 3 = \\boxed{45}$ tablespoons butter. We have that $\\frac{45}{8} = 5.\\overline{6}$, so we will need $\\boxed{6}$ sticks of butter, plus $\\frac{3}{8}$ a stick. We will have $\\frac{3}{8} \\cdot 1$ cup of sugar, and $\\boxed{10}\\frac{1}{2}$ cups of sugar. We will make $\\boxed{21}$ packages of chocolate drops, which will give us $\\boxed{21}$ chocolate drops in a bag. After we did all these instructions, we will have $\\boxed{11}$ sticks of butter.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 11. I hope it is correct.",
        " We can make a total of $216\\div15=14.4$ pans of cookies. Since we only can make whole pans, we will actually make $14$ pans of cookies, with $\\frac{4}{15}$ of a pan remaining.\nLet\u2019s write an expression in $x$ for the number of individual ingredients that we need:\n\\begin{align*}\n1.5\\cdot14&=\\frac{21}{2}\\\\\n2\\cdot14&=28\\\\\n\\frac{3}{8}\\cdot14\\cdot3&=\\frac{21}{2}\\\\\n\\frac{3}{4}\\cdot14&=\\frac{21}{2}.5\\cdot14\\cdot1&=7\n\\end{align*}\nIn the first line, we need $21/2 = 10.5$ cups of flour to make 14 full pans of cookies. Since the recipe requires 1.5 cups of flour, we will need $\\lceil 10.5/1.5 \\rceil = \\boxed{8}$ cups of flour.
