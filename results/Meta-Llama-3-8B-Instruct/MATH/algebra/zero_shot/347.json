I hope it is correct.ariate solutions for the system \\[ a + 2b + c &= 2 \\] \\[ b + c + d &= 1 \\] \\[ c + 2d + e &= 3 \\] and then translate these results into a solution for the original problem.  We need to find an expression for the variable $w$ in terms of the variables $x, y, z,$ and $t$.  By combining the equations in some way, we will reduce the number of variables in the system, allowing us to quickly find a solution.\nNotice that the equation $a+2b+c=2$ tells us how many times we can change the factor $x$ in $(x+1)^2 x$, since $a$ reflects how many times we change the factor $x$, $b$ how many times we change the factor $x$, and $c$ how many times we change the factor $x$ again.  If we choose an $a$ of 1, $b$ and $c$ equal 0, we get $1 \\cdot x^1 + 0x^0 + 0x^0 = x$, so we only need to multiply $x$ once, so $a=1$.  Plugging in $a=1$ into the system of equations \\[ a + 2b + c &= 2 \\quad (1) \\] \\[ b + c + d &= 1 \\quad (2) \\] \\[ c + 2d + e &= 3 \\quad (3) \\] gives the system \\[ 1 + 2b + c &= 2 \\] \\[ b + c + d &= 1 \\] \\[ c + 2d + e &= 3 \\] Since the equation $b+c+d=1$ tells us how many times we add the term 1 to $(x+1)^2$, which is two since we can add either 1 to $x+1$ and multiply it with 1 or directly multiply $x+1$ with 1, $b$ equals 1.  Since $b=1",
