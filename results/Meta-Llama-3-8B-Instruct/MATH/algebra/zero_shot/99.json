        " \nFirst, let\u2019s find the inverse function of $f(x)$.  The inverse function of $f(x)$ is $f^{-1}(x)$.  To find it, the function $f(x)$ needs to be solved for $x$ first.

So, the function $f^{-1}(x)=\\frac{x+5}{3}$.\nNow, we can evaluate the inverse function $f^{-1}(x)$ in the expression for $g(x)$.  This means that $f^{-1}(x)+1=\\frac{x+5}{3}+1=\\frac{x+8}{3}$.  Plugging this into the expression for $g(x)$, we get $g(x)=\\frac{1}{\\frac{x+8}{3}+1}$.  Next, we can simplify the expression by getting a common denominator and simplifying the numerator.

        " We are given two functions and we need to find $g(3)$.\n1. First, let\u2019s find the inverse function of $f(x)$.

It can serve as a review activity for students who have completed courses in algebra, trigonometry, and pre-calculus. This problem requires them to apply knowledge of inverse functions, functions, and composition of functions. It also allows students to practice problem-solving strategies, critical thinking, and mathematical communication. Begin by asking students to find the inverse of the function f(x)=frac{x+5}{3}. This requires students to interchange the x and y variables and solve for y. Next, ask students to find the function g(x)=frac{1}{f^{-1}(x)+1}. This requires students to use the inverse function found in step 1. Finally, ask students to calculate the value of g(3). This requires students to substitute 3 for x in the function g(x).\nNote: Students who struggle with this problem may need additional support to understand the concepts of inverse functions and function composition. Teachers can offer extra practice or review activities to help students develop their skills and confidence. Additionally, teachers can use this problem as a starting point for discussions on the real-world applications of inverse functions and function composition. For example, they could discuss how inverse functions are used in modeling real-world phenomena, such as population growth or chemical reactions. By emphasizing the practical applications of mathematical concepts, teachers can help students see the relevance and importance of these topics.\nAlso,",
