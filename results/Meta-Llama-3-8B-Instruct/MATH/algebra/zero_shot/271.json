    "solution": "The first 8 odd positive integers are 1, 3, $\\dots$, 15.  The sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, so their sum is $(1 + 15)/2 \\cdot 8 = 64$.\n\nLet the 5 consecutive even integers be $a$, $a + 2$, $a + 4$, $a + 6$, and $a + 8$.  Their sum is $5a + 20$.  But this is also $64 - 4 = 60$, so $5a + 20 = 60$.  Solving for $a$, we find $a = \\boxed{8}$.",

        " \n#### \n#### 1. First, let's find the sum of the first 8 consecutive odd counting numbers: 1+3+5+7+9+11+13+15 = 64    \n#### 2. Then, the sum of 5 consecutive even integers should be 4 less than 64. This means the sum of 5 consecutive even integers is 64 - 4 = 60    \n#### 3. To find the 5 consecutive even integers, let's add a fixed number to the first even integer, and we get 60. Let's name this fixed number x\n#### 4. The first even integer is 2, so we have 2+x+2+x+2+x+2+x+2 = 60 \n#### 5. Simplify the equation: \n8x+8 = 60\n8x = 52\nx = 6.5   \n#### 6. Find the smallest of the even integers by giving the first even integer x: \n2 + 6.5 = 8.5 (not even) \n#### 7. Add 2 more times to get 5 consecutive even integers:\n2 + 2x = 2 + 13 = 15 \n#### \n#### So, the smallest of the even integers is 15. \n#### Final Answer: The final answer is 15. I hope it is correct. 1\nI  got this.  It's okay but there might be a misunderstanding.   The smallest of the even integers  the problem is referring to is 2, not 15.   Well, the question states that the sum of 5 consecutive even integers is 4 less than 64. The sum of 5 consecutive even integers is 60, which means that 60 is 4 less than 64. So we need to find the smallest even number, what we call x. The formula is 2x+4=60. 2x=56, x=28 So, x is 28 but we need the smallest even number which is 2 higher than 28. That makes 30. Which is the smallest even number. \nFinal Answer: The final answer is 30. I hope it is correct. 2\n![ccc]\\(.png)  If you are interested in this topic, I'd be  happy to help you learn more about it.
