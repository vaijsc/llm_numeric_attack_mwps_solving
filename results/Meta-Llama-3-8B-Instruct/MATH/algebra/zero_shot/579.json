        "Let \\( d \\) represent the number of dimes and \\( n \\) represent the number of nickels. We are given the following information:\n1. The total number of coins is 11:\n   \\[\n   d + n = 11\n   \\]\n   \n2. The total value of the coins is 75 cents. Since a dime is worth 10 cents and a nickel is worth 5 cents, we can express this as:\n   \\[\n   10d + 5n = 75\n   \\]\nNow we have a system of equations to solve:\n1. From the first equation, we can express \\( d \\) in terms of \\( n \\):\n   \\[\n   d = 11 - n\n   \\]\n2. Next, we substitute this expression for \\( d \\) into the second equation:\n   \\[\n   10(11 - n) + 5n = 75\n   \\]\n3. Expanding this gives:\n   \\[\n   110 - 10n + 5n = 75\n   \\]\n4. Combining like terms leads to:\n   \\[\n   110 - 5n = 75\n   \\]\n5. Now, we isolate \\( n \\) by subtracting 110 from both sides:\n   \\[\n   -5n = 75 - 110\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   -5n = -35\n   \\]\n6. Dividing both sides by -5 gives:\n   \\[\n   n = 7\n   \\]\nNow we can find the number of dimes by substituting \\( n \\) back into the expression for \\( d \\):\n\\[\nd = 11 - n = 11 - 7 = 4\n\\]\nSo, Hillary has:\n- \\( d = 4 \\) dimes\n- \\( n = 7 \\) nickels\nTo verify, we check the total value:\n- Value from dimes: \\( 4 \\times 10 = 40 \\) cents\n- Value from nickels: \\( 7 \\times 5 = 35 \\) cents\n- Total value: \\( 40 + 35 = 75 \\) cents\nThus, the solution checks out.

        " To make this problem easier, first, we need to try to find the value of each coin.\n    - 11 coins x dime value ($0.10) = $1.10\n    - 11 coins x nickel value ($0.05) = 0.55\n    - $1.10 + 0.55 = $1.65 Not right, since we know that the coins are worth 75 cents in total. So, let\u2019s try it again:\n    - 11 coins x dime value ($0.10) = $1.10\n    - 11 coins x nickel value ($0.05) = 0.55\n    - $1.10 - $0.75 (75 cents) = $0.35... something\u2019s off! Since the dime value is not equal to 75 cents, we must have fewer dimes. Now, let\u2019s see how we can get closer to the total of 75 cents:\n    - Since $0.75 + something = $0.35 + something, the missing value is $0.40. We can then say that there are 4 dimes and 7 nickels.\n### Conclusion: Therefore, Hillary has 7 nickels.\n## Tarik\u2019s Puzzle\nHere\u2019s a special Tarik\u2019s Puzzle!

You can turn the switches on and off as many times as you want, but you can only enter the room once. How can you figure out which switch controls which light bulb?\n### Step-by-step instructions:\n    - Turn switch 1 to ON and leave it for 5 minutes.\n    - Turn switch 1 to OFF and turn switch 2 to ON.\n    - Turn switch 2 to OFF and turn switch 3 to ON.\n    - Enter the room and observe the light bulbs.\n    - Write down the following: Light Bulb (Left) Light Bulb (Center) Light Bulb (Right)\n    - Switch 1 was ON for 5 minutes, so one of the light bulbs must be warm. This means that one of the light bulbs is controlled by Switch 1.\n    - Switch 2 was ON after Switch 1 was OFF, so the light bulb that is still ON must be controlled by Switch 2.\n    - Since the left, center, and right bulbs are still LEFT ON, one of them must be controlling Switch 3.",
        " \nLet\u2019s break this problem down step by step. \n1. Hillary has eleven coins in total. \n2. The total value of the coins is 75 cents. As she has dimes and nickels, let\u2019s represent the value of each type of coin by variables. \nLet the value of dime = 10 cents and the value of a nickel = 5 cents. \n3. As the total value is 75 cents, we can create an equation using the information we have been given: \n10a + 5b = 75, where a is the number of dimes and b the number of nickels.\n4. Now we have to solve for the number of nickels (b).\n5. We are looking for the value of b, which will help us to find the number of nickels Hillary has.\n### Solution: \nTo solve for b, we can rewrite the equation as: \n5b = 75 - 10a \nWe know that Hillary has eleven coins in total. Out of these, a is the number of dimes. If a = 11 - b, as the number of coins cannot have a fractional part. \nSubstituting a in the equation, we get: \n5b = 75 - 10(11 - b) \nExpanding the equation and rearranging, we get: \n16b = 25 \nDividing both sides by 4, we get: \nb = 25/4 \nb = 6.25 \nSince b is the number of nickels Hillary has, it must have an integer value. This is possible only when we ignore the decimal part of b. \nHence, the value of b is 6.\nSo, Hillary has 6 nickels.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 6.

There are 11 - X dimes.\nThe total number of cents is: (11 - X) x 10 cents + X x 5 cents = 75 cents.\nWe want to solve this equation. The first thing to try is simple simplest answer: try x = 0. Then there are 11 x 10 = 110 cents - coins worth and 0 nickels, so it doesn't work.\nNow try x = 1. There are 10 x 10 = 100 cents and 1 x 5 = 5 cents, so it's close, but not yet.\nThe easiest way to check from here is to write out a chart of the answers.\nTry x = 2. There are 9 x 10 = 90 cents and 2 x 5 = 10 cents. Still not enough.\nTry x = 3. There are 8 x 10 = 80 cents and 3 x 5 = 15 cents. Getting closer.\nTry x = 4. There are 7 x 10 = 70 cents and 4 x 5 = 20 cents. Too many.\nTry x = 5. There are 6 x 10 = 60 cents and 5 x 5 = 25 cents. This is too many as well.\n### Step:\nX describes the number of nickels.\nX describes the number of nickels.\nTry x = 6. There are 5 x 10 = 50 cents and 6 x 5 = 30 cents. Finally we have 30 cents to spare.\nIt seems we have found x = 6.\n### Step:\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 6. We have found that there are 6 nickels. I hope it is correct.\nThanks for the assistance, here's why I chose x = 6:\nIf we consider x = 6, then there is 30 cents left over. That's 3 dimes.\nNow let's write the total costs of 6 nickels and 8 dimes (11 - 6):\n",
        " She has 11 coins, dimes and nickels, and they are worth 75 cents in total. \n    We will first need to think of how we can jump from a dime and a nickel to the next coin. Since a nickel is 5 cents, a dime is 10 cents. So a dime and a nickel together are 15 cents. \n    To make 75 cents with 11 coins, we divide 75 by 15 and round it down to 5. (because we can\u2019t have a fraction of a coin).\n    So if we subtract the value of the coins (5 x 15 cents) from the total value of the coins (75 cents), we find out how much is left:\n75 - (5 x 15) = 75 - 75 = 0.\n    We find out that we have 0 cents left. Which means that we have 0 dimes remaining. Otherwise, we would have to take away 10 cents, but we have 0 cents left. \n    So, we have 0 dimes. \n    We took away the value of 5 dimes, so the rest are nickels and dimes. Since we subtracted 5 dimes, we know that the remaining 6 coins (11 - 5 = 6) must be nickels.\n    A nickel is 5 cents, so 6 nickels is 6 x 5 = 30 cents. \n    We took away 30 cents. So we have 75 - 30 = 45 cents left. Since a dime is 10 cents, we can divide 45 by 10 and round down to 4 (45 x 1/10). \n    That means we have 4 dimes left.\n    And we have 6 nickels, since the remaining six coins were nickels.\n    So, in total, she has 6 nickels and 4 dimes.\n    The nickel value of 6 nickels is 6 x 5 = 30 cents. So, she has 6 nickels:\n6. \n    The answer is 6.    So, Hillary has 6 nickels.   Shape:    Number: 6\n",

The worth of a nickel is 5 cents.\n### Solution: The total worth of 75 cents is 75 / 10 = 7.5 dimes = 75 dimes = 7\n#### Explanation: So 7 dimes = 70 cents 75 - 70 = 5 cents 5 cents / 5 cents = 1\n#### We just found that 5 cents worth of nickels was accounted for. 5 cents / 5 cents = 1 nickel. 11 coins - 7 dimes - 1 nickel = 3 dimes\n#### Now for the 3 dimes. The worth of 3 dimes is 3 * 10 cents = 30 cents\n#### 30 cents / 5 cents = 6. This means she has 6 more nickels. Adding 6 to 1 gives her 7 nickels in total.\n# Summary: Given that Hillary has 11 coins, the 75 cents can be broken down into 7 dimes and 7 nickels. \n# We solved the problem, she has 7 nickels out of 11 coins.

Hence, we can write an equation, \u2018D + N = 11\u2019.\nThe total value of the coins can be written as (10D) + (5N) = 75.\nSince 10D represents the total value of 10 cents of all dimes, we know there are more dimes than nickels. 75 = 10(7.5) + 5(2.5), so the solution is to have 8 dimes and 3 nickels. In this case, the equation will be 8 + 3 = 11. For more information http://www.jiskha.com/math/algebra/determine-the-number-of-dimes-and-nickels.html\n### Answer: The answer is 3. Hillary has three nickels and 8 dimes. \nHere's interactive calculatoritus. Type the following command in calculatoritus: `(11-D)/2 = 1.5`\npress Enter. Then, type D = ? press Enter. The output will be 8.  So, 11 - 8 = 3.  Therefore, the number of nickels is 3.  You can check it on the link I provided, by simply swap out the numbers of nickels and dimes with what they should be. The interactive tool will give you the correct answer. \n### Calculation: \nwe know that 11 = D + N, So, D = 11 - N.\nthen, we can substitute D into the equation 10D + 5N = 75\n10(11 - N) + 5N = 75\n110 - 10N + 5N = 75\n110 - 5N = 75\n5N = 35\nN = 7\nN cannot be 7 because we know there are more dimes than nickels, and we don\u2019t have enough dimes. So, we must have N = 3.",
        " 3\nHillary has 75 cents in total. Dimes are worth 10 cents and nickels are worth 5 cents. Since there are 11 coins, the total value of the coins = 10d + 5n = 75.

        " \nHillary has dimes and nickels. A dime is worth 10 cents. A nickel is worth 5 cents.\nShe has a total of 75 cents. We divide 75 by 10 to find out how many dimes she has. 75 / 10 = 7.5, so Hillary has 7 dimes.\nThat leaves 75 - 70 = 5 cents that aren\u2019t used up by the dimes. We divide 5 by 5 to find out how many nickels she has. 5 / 5 = 1. So Hillary has one nickel.\n",

        " \nA single dime is worth 10 cents and a single nickel is worth 5 cents. So, we have to set up an equation for the total value of the coins.

        " Let\u2019s give this problem a name, e.g. \"exercise 1\".",
        " Let's start by using the information that the coins are worth $0.75. Since we know that dimes and nickels, we will have to use this information to make an equation. One dime is worth $0.10, and a nickel is worth $0.05. Since Hillary has 11 coins, the total value of the coins can be written as: 0.10x + 0.05y = 0.75 where x is the number of dimes, y is the number of nickels and x + y = 11 (since Hillary has 11 coins). We can solve the first equation for x: 0.10x = 0.75 - 0.05y 0.10x = 0.70 - 0.05y Divide both sides by 0.10: x = (0.70 - 0.05y) / 0.10 x = 7 - y/2 Now, substitute x = 7 - y/2 into the second equation: (7 - y/2) + y = 11 We can simplify to: 7 + 0.5y = 11 Add -7 to both sides: 0.5y = 4 Divide both sides by 0.5: y = 8 Now we know that Hillary has 8 nickels. To find the number of dimes, we can substitute y = 8 into the first equation: 0.10x + 0.05y = 0.75 0.10x + 0.05(8) = 0.75 0.10x = 0.75 - 0.40 0.10x = 0.35 Divide both sides by 0.10: x = 3.5 Since we can't have a half coin, we will round this number and say Hillary has 3 dimes. We have already found the number of nickels, which is 8. The answer is 8.\nThe statement \"Let's think step by step.\" is a phrase that means \"Let's break it down one step at a time.\" It is often used at the beginning of a mathematical or problem-solving process to indicate that the person is asking them to follow a detailed, step-by-step approach to solving the problem. In this case, the instruction is being given to help the person understand how to solve the problem: \"Hillary has eleven coins, all dimes",
        " Since each dime is worth 10 cents and each nickel is worth 5 cents, the total value of the dimes will be 10x and the total value of the nickels will be 5y\nWe know the total value of all coins is 75 cents or 75/100 dollars, so we can write the equation:\n10x + 5y = 75\nWe also know that the total number of coins is eleven, and the number of dimes plus the number of nickels equals eleven, so we can write the equation:\nx + y = 11\nNow we have two equations with two unknowns. We can use substitution or elimination to solve for x and y. Let\u2019s use elimination. To eliminate y, we can multiply the first equation by 5:\n50x + 25y = 375\nWe subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate y:\n50x - x + 25y - y = 375 - 11\nThis simplifies to:\n49x = 364\nNow we can divide by 49:\nx = 364 / 49\nx = 7.5\nSo Hillary has 7.5 dimes. But we can\u2019t have a half dime, so we round down to 7 dimes. So Hillary has 7 dimes and 4 nickels (since 11 - 7 = 4). Therefore, she has 4 nickels.",
        " \nLet's start by finding the total number of cents Hillary has. She has 75 cents in total, and that 75 cents is made up of two types of coins: nickels and dimes. A dime is 10 cents and a nickel is 5 cents. So we can set up the following equations:\n75 = 10x + 5y\nwhere x is the number of dimes and y is the number of nickels.\nWe know that Hillary has 11 coins in total, so we can set up another equation:\nx + y = 11\nNow we can solve these two equations. From the second equation, we know that y = 11 - x, so we can substitute that into the first equation:\n75 = 10x + 5(11 - x)\nor\n75 = 10x + 55 - 5x\nor\n75 = 5x + 55\nNow we can subtract 55 from both sides:\n20 = 5x\nNow we can divide both sides by 5:\n4 = x\nSo Hillary has 4 dimes. And since she has 11 coins in total, and 4 are dimes, then she must have 7 nickels. The answer is 7.",
        " Let's denote the number of nickels Hillary has as 'n.' \nAt first, I thought of using the fact that a dime is worth $0.1 and a nickel worth $0.05, so I thought the equation would be 0.1d + 0.05n = 75 cents. However, you're right to point out that we need to consider the constraint that n cannot be fractional. To avoid this, we define 'd' to be equal to 11 - n, and can then say 0.1(11 -n) + 0.05n = 75. We can then simplify this equation as follows:\n0.1(11 -n) = 0.75 - 0.05n\n1.1 - 0.1n = 0.75 - 0.05n\n0.05n = 0.4 - 0.1 = 0.3\nn = 0.3/0.05 = 6\nSo, Hillary has 6 nickels.\n(Differed thinking approach)\nWe can consider this problem in two parts - one cone contains 'n' nickels and another contains 11 - 'n' dimes. So, 0.05n + 0.1(11 - 'n') = 75 cents. We can simplify this as follows:\n0.05n + 1.1 - 0.1n = 75\n- 0.05n + 1.1 = 75\n0.05n = 75 - 1.1\n0.05n = 73.9\nn = 73.9 / 0.05\nn = 1479/10 = 6\nSo, Hillary has 6 nickels.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 6.

        " The coins of 75 cents are worth in total (11 * 1 dimes) + (x * 5 cents nickels)\n### Because they are equivalent to 75 cents, which is equivalent to 0.75 so the equation: 11 * 10 cents + 5x = 75 cents\n### First solve this equation. 110 cents + 5x = 75 cents\n### Subtract 110 cents from both sides: 5x = 75 cents \u2013 110 cents\n### 5x = -35 cents\n### x = -35 cents / 5: x = -7.

This means that the total worth is comprised of pieces of both 10 cents and 5 cents.\nWe are told that the total worth is 75 cents. Let n represent the number of nickels (5 cents each). Then, the number of dimes is 11 - n. Each dime is 10 cents, so the total value of the dimes is 10(11-n) = 110-10n.\nThe total value of the nickels is 5n cents. We know that 5n + 110 - 10n = 75.
