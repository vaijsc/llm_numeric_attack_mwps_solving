        " \nTo simplify our problem, we can start by calculating $18A$ and $18B$. We have $18A=18\\cdot\\frac{1}{4}=\\boxed{4.5}$. Similarly, $18B=18\\cdot\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)=-\\boxed{9}$. Now that we have these two values, we can find their absolute difference: $|4.5-(-9)|=|4.5+9|=|\\boxed{13.5}|$. Notice we don\u2019t need to take absolute values over here since 4.5 and -9 are far apart. Finally, since their difference is 13.5, we can express this quantity rounded to the nearest tenth as $\\boxed{13.5}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 13.5.

        " We are given that A is the ratio of numerator to denominator of the fraction, so A = 1/4. Also note that A is a positive number due to the presence of the word \"absolute value\". With this information, we can calculate 18A as follows.\n18A = 18(1/4)= 4.5\nOn the other hand, we are given that B = -1/2 which is a negative number. We can calculate 18B as follows.\n18B = 18(-1/2) = -9\nNow, the problem states we need the difference between 18A and 18B. So we can do this by subtracting one from the other.\n### Absolute value response: The difference between 18A and 18B is 4.5 - (-9) = 13.5. Now, the task is to find the absolute value of this difference. In taking the absolute value of a difference, we remove the sign, and we separate the absolute value operation from the other mathematical operations in the question. So, we have:\nThe absolute value of 4.5 - (-9) = |4.5 - (-9)| = |13.5| = 13.5\n### Final response: We can stop here, or we can round 13.5 to the nearest tenth. If we do this, we round 13.5 to 13.5.

Example 1: A sample of 100 students from a university yields 20 students who prefer a campus gym. Find a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of students at the university who prefer a campus gym. Solution: The sample proportion is $\\hat{p}=20/100=0.20$, and the standard error of the proportion is \\begin{align*} se(\\hat{p})&=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n}}\\\\ &=\\sqrt{\\frac{0.2(1-0.2)}{100}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{0.16}{100}}=\\sqrt{0.0016}=0.039. \\end{align*} The z-score required to obtain a 95% confidence interval for $\\hat{p}$ is $z_0.05=1.96$, which is obtained from the standard normal distribution. Therefore, the 95% confidence interval for $\\hat{p}$ is \\begin{align*} (\\hat{p}-z_0.05 se(\\hat{p}), \\hat{p}+z_0.05 se(\\hat{p})) &= (0.20-1.96(0.039), 0.20+1.96(0.039))\\\\ &= (0.1208, 0.2792). \\end",
