    "solution": "We can find the $x$-intercept by setting $y=0$ in the equation.  This gives us $\\frac{x}{4} = 1$, so $x =4$, which means $a=4$.  Similarly, letting $x=0$ gives $\\frac{y}{12} = 1$, so $y=12$, which means $b=12$.  There are several ways we can find the slope.  First, we could put the equation in slope-intercept form by subtracting $\\frac{x}{4}$ from both sides, and then multiplying by 12.  This gives $y = -3x +12$, which tells us that the slope is $-3$ (and confirms our solution for the $y$-intercept).  We also could have noted that since we have already shown that $(4,0)$ and $(0,12)$ are on the line, the slope of the line is $\\frac{12 -0}{0-4} = -3$.  Therefore, the desired sum is $4+12 -3 = \\boxed{13}$.",

        "  The equation is $\\frac{x}{4} + \\frac{y}{12} = 1.$\nSo, the line goes through the point $(x_0, y_0)$, where $\\frac{x_0}{4} + \\frac{y_0}{12} = 1.$\nNow, if we subtract $x_0/4$ on both sides of the equation, we get $y_0/12 = 1 - x_0/4$.  Multiplying both sides by 12, we have $y_0 = 12 - 3x_0.$  So, $y_0$ is linearly dependent on $x_0.$  Moreover, there is only one $x_0$ for which $y_0 = 0,$ and that is at $x_0 = 4$.  So, the $x$-intercept is $a = 4.$\nIf we subtract $y_0/12$ from both sides of the equation, then we get $\\frac{x_0}{4} = 1 - y_0/12,$ which is equivalent to $x_0 = 4 - y_0/3.$  Therefore, $x_0$ is linearly dependent on $y_0.$  The only $y_0$ for which $x_0 = 0$ is at $y_0 = 0$, which is the $y$-intercept.  So, the $y$-intercept is $b = 0.$\nFrom either the equations, we can calculate the slope of the line: $$m = \\frac{y_0}{x_0} = \\frac{12 - 3x_0}{x_0} = 3.$$ So, the value of $a + b + m$ is $\\boxed{4 + 0 + 3 = 7}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 7. I hope it is correct.  We could have worked it out in the same way as above without noting the original equation.  Instead, notice that the $x$-intercept and $y$-intercept is at $(-4,0)$ and $(0,-12)$, respectively, since these give us $x/4 + y/12 = 1.$  We can use either of these two points and either of the formulae for the slope to find $m",

        " Let's solve $\\frac{x}{4}+\\frac{y}{12}=1$.\nWe can solve $\\frac{x}{4}+\\frac{y}{12}=1$ by writing it as an equation, which is\n$$\\frac{x}{4}+\\frac{y}{12}=1$$ $$\\Rightarrow 12x+4y=48$$ $$\\Rightarrow 3x + y = 12$$ This equation has two points of intersection with the axes. For $x$-intercept, we let $y=0$, and solve for $x$: $$3x+y=12$$ $$\\Rightarrow 3x+0=12$$ $$\\Rightarrow 3x=12$$ $$\\Rightarrow x=\\boxed{4}$$ Since $y=0$, the $x$-coordinate of $a$ is $4$.\nFor $y$-intercept, we let $x=0$, and solve for $y$: $$3x+y=12$$ $$\\Rightarrow 3(0)+y=12$$ $$\\Rightarrow y=12$$ Since $x=0$, the $y$-coordinate of $b$ is $12$.\nFor slope, we can find the slope by using either the slope formula $m=(y_2-y_1)/(x_2-x_1)$ or the one-point formula. This is easier.\nWe take $\\left(x,y\\right)=\\left(4,0\\right)$ as one point on line. Plug in the value: $$m = \\frac{0-0}{4-0}$$ $$m=0$$ The slope of the line is $0$.\nThe sum of all values is $4 + 12 + 0 = 16$. So $a+b+m = 16$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 16.

        " We know that $\\frac{x}4 + \\frac{y}{12} = 1$ is a linear equation, so it must be the equation of a line with slope $m$ and $y$-intercept $b$.  Equivalently, let $b$ be the $y$-intercept, $m$ be the slope of the line and $a$ be the $x$-intercept.  We can write this equation equivalently as $y = 12 - \\frac{3x}4$, or $y = m(x-a)+b.$\n### Explanation: $m$ stands for the slope of a line: $$m=\\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}=\\frac{12}{4}=3$$$$\\frac{x}{4}+\\frac{y}{12}=1$$ $$\\frac{x}{4}+y=12$$ $$y=12-\\frac{x}{4}=3x$$\n  $$m=3,x=a, y=b$$ $$a=?$$  $$4a=0$$ $$a=0$$ $$b=?$$  $$12-b=0$$ $$b=12$$ $$a+b+m=?$$ $$0+12+3=15$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 15.

        " We can interpret the given equation $\\frac{x}4 + \\frac{y}{12} = 1$ as follows:\n### Note: The equation of a line in the form $\\frac{x}{a} + \\frac{y}{b} = 1$ corresponds to the line passing through the points $(0,b)$ and $(a,0)$. In particular, the $x$-intercept is $a$ and the $y$-intercept is $b$.\n### ",
        " First we need to write the equation provided in the form $y = mx + b$. So, we subtract $\\frac{x}4$ to both sides to get $\\frac{y}{12} = 1 - \\frac{x}{4}$. If we multiply $\\frac{12}{12}$ to both sides we get $\\frac{y}{12} \\cdot \\frac{12}{12} = 1 - \\frac{x}{4} \\cdot \\frac{12}{12}$. This simplifies to $\\frac{y}{1} = 3 - \\frac{3}{1} \\cdot x$. This is equivalent to $y = 3x-3$, so we see that $m = 3$. To find the $y$-intercept, we can solve $0 = 3\\cdot 0 - 3$, which gives $b = 3$. To find the $x$-intercept, we solve $1 = \\frac{x}{4} + \\frac{0}{12}$. We can simplify this to $1 = \\frac{x}{4}$, so $x = 4$ is the $x$-intercept. Therefore, $a = 4$. So we see that $a + b + m = 4 + 3 + 3 = \\boxed{10}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 10. I hope it is correct. #### Video explanation available here. Enjoy the video!

        " The value of $a + b + m$ is $a + b + 3 = \\boxed{13}.$\n### Give a hint to find the value of $a$. The slope-intercept form of a line's equation is written as $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the $y$-intercept. Why did we not use this form in the given equation?\n### What might I do?\nThe given equation is not in the slope-intercept form, which means that we cannot directly use the slope-intercept form to determine the value of $m$. Also, using this form, we cannot determine the value of $a$. Since the equation is $\\frac{x}4 + \\frac{y}{12} = 1$, we can solve for $y$ and use this function to find the value of $m$.

Since the line passes through the point $(0,12)$, we can plug in $x = 0$ and $y = 12$. $\\frac{3\\cdot0}2 = 0$ Then, the slope $m$ is $m = -\\frac{3}2$.\n### Another way.\nAnother way to solve this problem is to use a similar triangle.

        " First, find the equation in slope-intercept form. This will make it easier to find $a$, $b$, and $m$.\nTo get the equation in slope-intercept form, we get the equation $0 = \\frac{x}4 + \\frac{y}{12} - 1$. We do that by subtracting $1$ to both sides and then multiplying each term by $24$, because we know that $0$ multiplied by $24$ is still $0$.\nThis gives us $0 = 6x + 3y - 24$, and then we move everything to one side to get $3y = -6x + 24$. Now we divide by $3$ to get $y = -2x + 8$. Finally, the equation is $y = -2x + 8$, so we can see that $a$ is $4$ and $b$ is $8$.\nNow, to find $m$, we see that $m$ is the slope, which is $-2$. Now we can add $a + b + m$ to find the desired value. $a = 4$, $b = 8$, and $m = -2$, and when we add them we get $4 + 8 - 2 = \\boxed{10}$.\n### Final ",
        " First, we rewrite the equation of the line as $y = - \\frac{1}{4}x + 12.$  We recognize that the intercepts are given by $(a,0)$, $(0,b)$.\nFor $(0,b)$, we plug in $x=0$ to get $0 = b$ and therefore $b = 0.$\nFor $(a,0)$, we plug in $y=0$ to get $\\frac{a}{4} = 1,$ and therefore $a = 4$.\nFinally, to find the slope $m$, we see that $m = - \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot 12,$ so $m = -3.$\nNow, $a + b + m = 4 + 0 + (-3) = \\boxed{1}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 1.

        " a = 3; b = 9; m = 1/2\nIf $a$ is the $x$-intercept, then the value of $a$ will be the value of $x$ when $y = 0$.  On the given equation, we have\n$$\\frac x4 + \\frac{0}{12} = 1 \\Rightarrow 4x = 48 \\Rightarrow x = 12.$$Therefore, $a = \\boxed{3}$.\nIf $b$ is the $y$-intercept, then the value of $b$ will be the value of $y$ when $x = 0$.  On the given equation, we have $$\\frac{0}{4} + \\frac{y}{12} = 1 \\Rightarrow \\frac{1}{3}y = 1 \\Rightarrow y = 3,$$so $b = \\boxed{9}$.\nOn the given equation, you can also rewrite it as\n$$y = -\\frac{1}{4} x + 3,$$from which you can see that the slope is $$m = -\\frac{1}{4} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}.$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 3 + 9 + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{19}{2}. I hope it is correct.  Final Answer: The final answer is a= 3; b=9; m=1/2. I hope it is correct..exceptions[\u201clevelname\u201d][\u201cmessage\u201d][\u201cecuture$igenous$1:http:// eb[g] The line must pass through both the origin and the point (4,10). If so, then b = 8. If we know that the line equation is in the form y = mx + b, then it can be simplified to y/12 = x/4 + 1, which implies that y = x/2 + 12. Solving the equation 12 = x/2 + 12 gives the equation 0 = x/2. Solving for x results in x = 0. So a = 0. In conclusion, a + b + m = 0 + 8 + 1/2, so a + b + m = 7/2 = 3.5. If a is the x-intercept, then the value of a is the value of x when y is equal",
        " The expression represents a line in slope-intercept form. For $y=mx+b$ we have $m=\\frac{y}{12}$ and $b=12-4x$. We also have that $a=4$ from the coordinates. Putting it all together, we have $a=4$, $b=\\frac{8}{3}$ and $m=\\frac{1}{3}$. So, our final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{15}{3}=5}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 5. I hope it is correct."
