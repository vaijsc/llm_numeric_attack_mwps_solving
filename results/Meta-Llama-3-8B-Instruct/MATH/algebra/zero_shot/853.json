Also, note that it is possible to expands a formula consider the power of one, and also one of two factor. Here, This leads us that $\\sqrt{2}$^{n}- expression to write its $result=(\\sqrt{2})^{n}$^{n}- other terms\n3.

Therefore, $a=8$, $b=9$ and $c=3$, so $a+b+c=\\boxed{20}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 20. I hope it is correct.\u200b\nAlthough we can continue to work out specific examples like this without realizing what is happening, we can actually prove that to any polynomial $P(x)$ there exist polynomials $Q(x)$ and $R(x)$ such that $P(x+y)=Q(x)+R(y)$. To prove this, we can start with the following two fundamental results that I call $\\boxed{The Magic Lemmas}$.\n**The Magic Lemmas:**\n1. **The First Magic Lemma:** $$f(x+y)=f(x)+(f(y)+f(x)^2+f(y)^2)$$\n2. **The Second Magic Lemma:** $$a^2+b^2=(a+b)^2-2ab$$\nComment: To illustrate how we can use these Magic Lemmas, let us give a few examples each.\nSo, this is amazing and I hope this hits you like it hit me. I still don\u2019t get why I hadn\u2019t learned this in school. Very power toe tool with plenty of potential applications.\nIts application in complex numbers is sure to be a powerful tool in either high school or university algebra and geometry classes. If you really understand complex numbers, you have a pretty good view of all of the types of algebraic geometry in more advanced classes.\nYou can share related videos or comment your question if you require",

I hope it is correct.  solution: Let's start from $(\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{3})^3$(Notice: $\\sqrt{6}$ is rational). We will cube the parentheses.$ $(\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{3})^3 = (\\sqrt{2})^3 + 3(\\sqrt{2})^2(\\sqrt{3}) + 3\\sqrt{2}(\\sqrt{3})^2 + (\\sqrt{3})^3 = 2\\sqrt{2} + 3\\sqrt{6} + 3\\sqrt{6} + 3\\sqrt{3} = 2\\sqrt{2} + 6\\sqrt{6} + 3\\sqrt{3}$Now divide it by $\\sqrt{2}$. Let it be x =$\\frac{(\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{3})^3}{\\sqrt{2}}$.$x = (\\frac{\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{2}})^3 = \\sqrt{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{\\sqrt{2}} + \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}}\\sqrt{3}$ From the second term, we get $(\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{\\sqrt{",
        " The main idea here is to cube $(\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{3})$.  In general when we cube an expression, we use the binomial expansion $(x+y)^3 = x^3 + 3x^2y + 3xy^2 + y^3$.  Notice that the exponents of $x$ and $y$ decrease by $1$, but when we do that, we multiply with $3$.\n(For example $(x+y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2$)\nWhen we cube $(\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3})$, we will get $a$\u2019s with the powers of $(\\sqrt{2})^3=2\\sqrt{2}$ and powers of $(\\sqrt{3})^3=3\\sqrt{3}$ and pairs that result in the cross-product of powers of $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3}$.  Thus we will have the following.\n$(\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{3})^3 = (\\sqrt{2})^3+3(\\sqrt{2})^2(\\sqrt{3})+3(\\sqrt{2})(\\sqrt{3})^2+(\\sqrt{3})^3$\nThis simplifies to\n$=2\\sqrt{2}+3\\sqrt{6}+6\\sqrt{3}+3\\sqrt{3}\\sqrt{6}$\nWhich simplifies to\n$=\\boxed{17\\sqrt{6}}$\nSo we can write $a=0,b=17,c=0$ and thus $a+b+c=0+17+0=\\boxed{17}$."
