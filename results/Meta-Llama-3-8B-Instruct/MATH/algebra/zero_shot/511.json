The number $\\sqrt{2}$ is known as a irrational number because it can't be expressed as a finite decimal or integer. It can't be expressed in the form $A/B$ where $A$ and $B$ are positive integers. In this problem, we should write the number so that the denominator must be rational. Here we have a complex fraction so we will let the denominator to become a rational number by multiplying and dividing by the correct value. First, we can multiply by $1$, in the form $2+\\sqrt{3}$: $$\\frac{1+\\sqrt{2}}{2+\\sqrt{3}}=\\frac{(1+\\sqrt{2})(2+\\sqrt{3})}{(2+\\sqrt{3})(2+\\sqrt{3})}$$ This way, the fraction becomes: $$\\frac{1+\\sqrt{2}}{2+\\sqrt{3}}=\\frac{2+\\sqrt{2}+2\\sqrt{3}+\\sqrt{6}}{4+3}$$ Now we can simplify the fraction: $$\\frac{1+\\sqrt{2}}{2+\\sqrt{3}}=\\frac{2+\\sqrt{2}+2\\sqrt{3}+\\sqrt{6}}{7}$$ This way, it becomes rational. So we can leave it now, but we have to make sure that we have the exact answer of the question.   #### Keep in mind: Simplification in rationalizing the denominator by multiplying the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which",
