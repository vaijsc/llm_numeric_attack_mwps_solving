        " \nLet\u2019s get a common system of equations by eliminating $d$ and $c$ to give us a unique solution. The first step we need to do is to subtract $2d-9c=20$ from $d-6c=4$. \n$(d-6c) - (2d-9c) = 4 - 20$\nThis will give us $(d-2d)-6c+9c=4-20$, which in turn simplifies to $-d+3c=-16$.\nNow, let\u2019s invert that equation and write it as an equation in terms of $d$ only. $d=3c+16$.\nIt is readily apparent that we will need to go back \u2018up the chain\u2019 and plug this equation into the original system of equations. We can plug it into either equation, so let\u2019s go with the first one. \nWe will substitute $d=3c+16$ into $d-6c=4$.\n$(3c+16)-6c=4$.\nNow, simplify the equation.\n$-3c+16=4$.\nThe rest is the same, and the result is $c=-4$ and $d=20$.
