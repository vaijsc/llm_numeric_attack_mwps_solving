I hope it is correct.  Ultimately, the problem-solving process is much clearer when considering both the parts of the piecewise function separately.  Ideally, problems of this nature should be provided with some guidance on which parts to focus on first.  Students may try to solve the equations if $x \\lt 3$, then the equations if $x \\gt 3$, which can lead to misunderstandings.  Instead, they should evaluate the function for the smallest possible values of $x$ and work their way up.  For instance, they might begin by evaluating $f(0)$, then $f(1)$, $f(2)$, $f(3)$, and so on.  This means that after evaluating $f(3)$, they would know that $f(x)=8-4x$ for all $x \\gt 3$, and they could immediately determine that $f(x)=0$ when $x=2$.  Had they only solved the equations if $x \\lt 3$, they would have overlooked this solution.  Furthermore, this approach encourages students to evaluate each part of the function and to be aware of the range of values that they are using in their calculations.  It is crucial for students to realize that the Conditional statements and the piecewise notation do not necessarily require solving equations; instead, students should be utilizing their analytical skills to evaluate the function for positive real numbers and leveraging their knowledge of function notation to do so. </br></br> References: Zacharia, G.
