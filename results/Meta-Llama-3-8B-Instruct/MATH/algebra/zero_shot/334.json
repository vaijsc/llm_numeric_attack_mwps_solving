        " Since the equation $\\sqrt{4c-5c^2} = 0$ is a square root equation, we need to take the square of both sides.

        " \n1. We can't automatically conclude that $c = 0$, since $0$ is also a solution. Instead, we should think about what makes the equation equal to $0$. In other words, we should analyze the solution in more detail.\n2. Wait, does it mean that the square root is zero? If so, we can express $\\sqrt{4c-5c^2}$ as $0$.

You can finish it.\n### Why is this result problematic?\nThe problem here is that we have a radical expression, but we are asked to find a nonzero solution to it. However, in order to guarantee the existence of a real solution, the radicand inside the radical square root must be non-negative. So, our initial assumption that the equation has a nonzero solution is flawed. In fact, no such solution exists.\nIt is amusing that we can solve the equation by completing the square, but we can then see that there are no real solutions to the equation that satisfy this condition. It is like the victim set themselves up for failure.",

        " A nonzero solution to $\\sqrt{4c-5c^2} = 0$ is $\\boxed{c = \\frac{4}{5}}$.\n#### Explanation:\n Stephanie's ",
        " First, I use the property of absolute value to simplify the equation.\n$| \\sqrt{4c-5c^2} | = 0$\nThis is true if $4c-5c^2 = 0$. But $4c-5c^2$ is a quadratic expression, so we can factor it.\nOr we can solve $4c-5c^2=0$ as:\n$4c-5c^2 = 0$\n$4c = 5c^2$\n$c(4-5c) = 0$\nNow we solve for c by setting each term to zero and factoring out c from each expression.\nc = 0 or\n4 - 5c = 0\nFirst, we try c = 0:\n4 - 5c = 0\n4 = 0 (false)\nSecond, we try c = 4/5:\nc = 4/5\nThen we plug c = 4/5 into 4c - 5c^2 to see if the equation is satisfied:\n4c - 5c^2 = 4/5 - 5 (4/5)^2\n= 4/5 - (5/25)\n= 4/5 - 1/5\n= 3/5\n3/5 \u2260 0, so the solution c = 4/5 is valid.\nWe can summarize our steps as follows:\nc = 0 (false)\nc = 4/5 (True)\nSo we get one solution c = 4/5. Now, let\u2019s check the solution.\nPlug c = 4/5 into the original equation: $\\sqrt{4c-5c^2} = \\sqrt{4(4/5)-5(4/5)^2} = \\sqrt{(16/5)-(16/25)} = \\sqrt{(16/5)-(16/25)} = \\sqrt{(32-16)/25} = \\sqrt{16/25} = \\boxed{4/5}$\nSo c = 4/5 is indeed a solution.

        " If $\\sqrt{4c-5c^2} = 0$, then $4c-5c^2=0$. Rearranging the given equation gives $5c^2-4c=0$. This is a quadratic equation in $c$.
