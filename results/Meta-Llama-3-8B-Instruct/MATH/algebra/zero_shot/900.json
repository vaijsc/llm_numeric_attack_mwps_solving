        " \\\\\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 4. I hope it is correct.\\\\\nFor this problem, it is easier to convert the line 2x + 5y = 11 to the slope-intercept form. Here is one way to do it. We can rewrite the line equation as $$2x+5y=11 \\Rightarrow 5y=-2x+11 \\Rightarrow y=-\\frac{2}{5}x+\\frac{11}{5}.$$ This means the slope is -\\frac{2}{5} and the y-intercept is \\frac{11}{5}, so the line has a slope of -\\frac{2}{5} and y-intercept of \\frac{11}{5}. The line 3y = x intersects the line at two points (these points can be found by using substitution or elimination method, but I can also show that we can get the equation of the line in the slope-intercept form as 3y = x by writing 3y = x in this way, y = x/3). So we get the two lines 3y = x and y = -\\frac{2}{5}x+\\frac{11}{5} could intersect at y = x/3. Now we have \\begin{align*} \\frac{x}{3}&= \\frac{2}{5}x - \\frac{11}{5} \\\\ &= \\frac{2}{5}x - \\frac{2}{5}\\frac{11}{2} \\\\ &= \\frac{2}{5}x - \\frac{11}{10} \\\\ 15x &= 33 \\\\ &= 3\\cdot11 \\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad x&=11 \\\\ y&=3 \\\\ A(11, 3) \\end{align*} The sum of the coordinates of the point is \\boxed{11+3 = 14.}\n### ",
