They involve the use of abstract concepts, such as floor functions, to guide students in evaluating the expressions. The use of these instructions, in conjunction with other strategies, can help students to develop their critical thinking and problem-solving skills, as well as their ability to think abstractly and work flexibly with mathematical concepts. To use these instructions effectively, students need to understand the meanings of the floor function, the notion of greatest integer less than, and the solving step.   The following example illustrates how to use these instructions effectively:   Example: Evaluate $\\lfloor 6.7\\rfloor + \\lfloor -6.7\\rfloor.$   Solution:   In the first term, $\\lfloor 6.7\\rfloor$, the greatest integer less than 6.7 is 6.   In the second term, $\\lfloor -6.7\\rfloor$, the greatest integer less than -6.7 is -7.   Therefore, the sum is $6 + (-7) = \\boxed{-1}.$   We can use these same instructions to evaluate other mathematical expressions that involve the floor function and greatest integers.
