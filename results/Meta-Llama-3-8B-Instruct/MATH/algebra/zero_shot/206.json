        " Well thought out!\nLet's go step by step. $(-125)^{4/3}$; take the negative sign out. Expression becomes $-((125)^{4/3})$. 125 is a perfect cube, it is equal to 5^3 . So,  $(125)^{4/3}$ becomes $(5^3)^{4/3}$ . 4/3 reduces to 8/3 when the bases are same and powers are different. Statement becomes $(5^3)^{8/3}$. It simplifies to $5^{24/3}$ or $5^8$ . Now we know that expression equals  $-5^8$. In the actual computation we don't write the negative sign. We don't compute the entire expression. We  have $-5^8$ so,  -16384 is the answer.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -16384.

        " $(-125)^{4/3}$ = ((-125)^(1/3))^4 = $(\\sqrt[3]{-125})^4$ = $('-5)^4$ = $\\boxed{-625}$\n### Guidance Statement:\n#### Expression Evaluation\nRecall the exponent rule: $a^{m}\\times a^{n}=a^{m+n}$. Since $\\frac{4}{3}$ can be written as $\\frac{4}{3}\\cdot\\frac{3}{1}$, we can apply the rule:\n$(-125)^{4/3}=((-125)^{1/3})^4$.\n#### Simplify Cube Root\nRecall the power rule: $a^{m}\\times a^{n}=a^{m+n}$. Since $(125)^{1/3}$ is equal to the cube root of 125, we can evaluate the expression as:\n$(-125)^{4/3}=(\\sqrt[3]{-125})^4$.\n#### Simplify Exponent\nRecall the exponent rule: $a^{m}\\times a^{n}=a^{m+n}$. Since 4 can be written as $4\\cdot 1$, we can apply the rule:\n$(-125)^{4/3}=((-125)^{1/3})^4=(\\sqrt[3]{-125})^4$.\n#### Evaluate Expression\nRecall the integer exponent rule: $a^{n}$ means the product of $a$ with itself $n$ times. Since 4 is an integer, we can evaluate the expression as:\n$(-125)^{4/3}=((-125)^{1/3})^4=(-5)^4=\\boxed{-625}$.\n### Conclusion:\nThe expression $(-125)^{4/3}$ can be evaluated by applying the exponent rules, canceling out common factors, and using arithmetic operations. By following these steps, we can simplify the expression to find the final answer $\\boxed{-625}$.\n### Assessment:\nEvaluate $\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^6$.\n### Guidance Statement:\n#### Expression Evaluation\nRecall the exponent rule: $a^{m}\\times a^{n}=a^{m+n}$. Since 6 can be written as $3\\cdot 2$, we can apply the rule:\n$\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^6=\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^{3\\cdot ",
