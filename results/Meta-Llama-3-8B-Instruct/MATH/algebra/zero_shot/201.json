        " We have that $j$ and $k$ are inversely proportional. \u00a0This means that the product of $j$ and $k$ is equal to a constant. \u00a0This constant however depends on the problem. \u00a0This means that $jk=56*42=2344$. \u00a0Here is a table that further explains this:\nDataset k j j*k\n1 56 42 2344\n2 32 ? ?\nWe have to find the value of $j$ in the second set in the table. \u00a0Since $k$ in the second set \u00a0is 32 and $k$ in the first set was 56, we have to adjust the value of $j$ to compensate for the decrease in $k.$ \u00a0This is since we know that the product of $j$ and $k$ must remain constant ($jk=2344$). \u00a0This means that $j_2$ must be greater than 42. \u00a0$56*42=32*j_2$. \u00a0This simplifies to $32*j_2=56*42=1176$. \u00a0Dividing both sides by 32, $j_2=\\frac{1176}{32}=36.75$ or to the nearest tenth $\\boxed{36.8}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 36.8.

        " Now, note that $j$ and $k$ are inversely proportional. If $k$ is increased by a factor of $a$, then $j$ would decrease by a factor of $a$. On the other hand, if $k$ is decreased by a factor of $b$, then $j$ would increase by a factor of $b$. What this means is that the product $jk$ must always be equal to a constant value. If we let $k=56$, $j=42$, then the value of the constant is $56 \\cdot 42 = 2352$. So we want to evaluate $j$ for when $k = 32$, which means we will need to know the value of $a$ such that $56 = 32 \\cdot a$. Solving for $a$ by dividing both sides by $32$ yields $a = 7/4$. So we know that $j$ needs to decrease by a factor of $\\frac{7}{4}$ when $k$ increases by a factor of 1.75. With $k = 56$, $j = 42$, which means $42 = 56 \\cdot 42 \\cdot \\frac{4}{7}$. Since this means the constant is always equal to $56$, we can use the fact that $jk$ is equal to the constant $56$, and we have $32j = 56 \\cdot 42 \\cdot \\frac{4}{7}$ or $j = 38.285714$. So the answer is 38.3 (rounded to the nearest tenth).Final Answer: The final answer is 38.3. I hope it is correct. If you want to know more or have any further questions, kindly let me know.
