        " First, to find $f^{-1}(2010)$, we solve $x^3+3x^2+3x+1=2010$.\nThat\u2019s a monster polynomial! You can either do long division if you are familiar, or use rational root theorem or synthetic division if you are feeling fancy. Alternatively, you can use Wolfram Alpha to give you an answer.\nFor me, I simply wish to get rid of the big constants by letting $k=2010-1=2009$ and setting $f(x)=x^3+3x^2+3x +k$ and $f(f^{-1}(x))=2010$ gives. So, now we need to solve $(x+3)^3 +k(x+3)=2010$. Let us use expansion:\n\\begin{align*}\n  f(f^{-1}(x))&=(x+3)^3 +k(x+3) \\\\&=~x^3 + 9x^2 +27x + 27 + kx + 3k \\\\&= x^3 + (9+k)x^2 + (27+k)x + (27+3k) \\end{align*} We can now compare this with $f(x)=x^3+3x^2+3x+1$ and remember that $f(f^{-1}(x)) = x$. So, now we need to match this by comparing like coefficients:\\begin{align*} 1 &= 1 \\\\ 3 &= 9+k \\\\ 3 &= 27+k \\\\ 1 &= 27+3k \\end{align*} Hence, we get the system $\\begin{cases} 9+k=3 \\\\ 27+k=3 \\\\ 27+3k=1 \\end{cases} \\implies k=-20 \\implies f^{-1}(2010)=-8$.\nNow that we have $f^{-1}(2010)=-8$, we know $$f(f^{-1}(2010))=f(-8)=(-8)^3+3(-8)^2+3(-8)+1=\\boxed{477}.$$~~~~~~ Final Answer: The final answer is 477.

        " If you solve $f(x)=2010$ for $x$, you obtain $f(x)=x^3+3x^2+3x+1=2010$, which simplifies to $x^3+3x^2+3x-2009=0$.\nTo solve this polynomial, we first factor it as $$x^3+3x^2+3x-2009=(x+1)^3-2009.$$Now, using the difference of cubes formula (and dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 3, we simplify the expression $(x+1)^3-2009$ to $((x+1)^3-2009) / 3=\\left((x+1)^2-[(2009/3)]\\right)\\left((x+1)-\\sqrt{(2009/3)}\\right)$.

        " \nTo calculate $f(f^{-1}(2010))$, we need to first find $f^{-1}(2010)$. To do this, we set $f(x)=2010$: $x^3+3x^2+3x+1=2010.$Note that the key to this problem is the last term $+1$. Expanding the left-hand side, we have $x^3+3x^2+3x=2009,$or $x^3+3x^2+3x-2009=0.$We are looking for integer solutions. We try to factor the polynomial by finding a factor that can be subtracted from both sides of the equation above, and we want the quotient to be a factor of 2009, a Mersenne prime. A Mersenne prime often can be factorized into the form $p^k-1$, so the last term might also be expressed in that way. In particular, when $p=7$ and $k=2$, we have $7^2-1=49-1=48,$which is relatively close to 2009. We doubt that $7^3-1=224=2^4\\cdot5\\cdot7$ is far from 2009. So $7^2-1$ must be a factor of $x^3+3x^2+3x-2009$. Therefore,$(x+7)^2-10=0,$or $x^2+14x+33=0,$which can be solved using the quadratic formula. The only integer solution is $x = -7,$which can also be verified by solving the equation using factorization.\n### Answer:\nFurther, we have \\begin{align*}\nf(-7)&=(-7)^3+3(-7)^2+3(-7)+1=-49+21-21+1=-49-21=-70\\\\\n&=-70.\n\\end{align*}So $f^{-1}(2010)=-7$, and we finally have\n$$(f(f^{-1}(2010))=f(-7)=-70.$$Alternatively, we can apply Newton's method to the equation $f(x)=2010$ with $x_0=0.$ After some work, we have\n\\begin{align*}\nx_1&=3,\\\\\nx_2&=3.33333333,\\\\\nx_",
        " I'll do step by step like that.\nThe first step is to find $f^{-1}(2010)$. To do this, we need to solve $f(x)=2010$. Let's do this. We have\n$\\begin{align*}\nf(x)&=2010\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\quad x^3+3x^2+3x+1&=2010\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\quad x^3+3x^2+3x&=2009\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\quad x(x^2+3x+1)&=2009\n\\end{align*}$\nNow this is a quadratic function in $x$, but then there is a product, which makes it not quadratic.\n$2009 = x(x^2+3x+1).$\nWe can rearrange this equation into the form $x(x+3)(x+2) = 2009$ and then by factorizing the left side of this equation we can write it as\n$4001 = (x+1)(x+3)(x+2).$\nFrom here, we can find $x$. First, we will find the dividers of the right side of this equation.\n$\\boxed{1,3,31}$\nSo, we have 3 dividers. From the dividers, we can make a table.\n[table]\n$\\boxed{\\left[ \\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|} x & 1 & 3 & 31 \\\\ \\hline (x+1) & 2 & 2 & 30 \\\\ (x+3) & 2 & 2 & 28 \\\\ (x+2) & 1 & 1 & 29 \\end{array} \\right]}$\nNow, we can compare the dividers and numbers in the last column. When the dividers are equal, we have a solution.\n$28 = 2\\times 14$ so, $x+3 = 2$ or $x$ = $\\boxed{-3}$.\nThe second step is to find $f(f^{-1}(2010))$. First, we have to find $f^{-1}(2010)$, which we have already found: $x=-3$. Now, we will evaluate $f$ in $f^{-1}(2010)$.\n$\\boxed{f(-3) = f(f^{-1}(2010))}$\nThe equation of $f",
        " First, we find the inverse function $f^{-1}(x)$. (Note that we assume that $x$ is non-negative. If not take absolute values).\nIf $y = f(x) = x^3 + 3x^2 + 3x + 1$, then substituting $f(y)$ instead of $x$, we get\n\\begin{align*}\ny &=(f(y))^3+3(f(y))^2+3(f(y))+1\\\\\ny-1 &= (f(y))^3+3(f(y))^2+3(f(y))\\\\\n(y-1)-3(f(y))-3(f(y))^2 &= (f(y))^3\\\\\nu^3 - 3u^2 - 3u &= y-1\\\\\n(u-1)^3 &= y\\\\\nu^{-1}(u-1)^3 &= y\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad f^{-1}(y) &=(y^{1/3}-1)^{-1}.\n\\end{align*}### To see why this inverse function makes sense, let $y=0$; then $x=1$, which gives $f(1)=1$. Taking $y=f(1)=1$ we obtain $f^{-1}(1)=1$ and substituting $y=1$ into $f(x)$, we have $f((1)^{1/3}-1)^{-1}=1$.\nLet $y=2010$. We now find $x=(2010)^{1/3}-1$, which gives $f^{-1}(2010)=2010^{1/3}-1$. So, using this value of $x$ we get $f(2010^{1/3}-1)$ which can be found through substitution. $f(2010^{1/3}-1)=\\boxed{2012}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2012.
