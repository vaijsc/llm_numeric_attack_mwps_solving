So, the person who will take the chocolates will take only 7 chocolates out of the original 8 chocolates.\u201d tip: The children want $\\frac{4}{10}$ chocolates means add 2 chocolates to the numerator and denominator.

        " \nThe key step here is to simply add the number to the numerator and denominator: $$ \\frac{5+x}{8+x}.$$We want this expression to equal 0.4.  So, we can set up an equation: $$ \\frac{5+x}{8+x}=0.4=\\frac{4}{10}.$$We can clear the fraction by multiplying both sides by 10: $$ 10(5+x)=4(8+x).$$Now we can simplify the expression:\n$$50+10x=32+4x.$$The key step here is to subtract 50 and 4x from both sides:\n$$6x=32-50=-18.$$Dividing both sides by 6, we have\n$$x=\\boxed{-3}.$$That was a long step, but useful for solving problems.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -3. I hope it is correct.  Please take note that a number cannot be added to the denominator of 0.4 because 0.4 is a decimal, not a fraction.  The question should have been $\\frac{4}{10}=\\frac{2}{5}$ for consistency.  Let me know if I am wrong.

        "  \nThe fraction is currently $\\frac{5}{8}$, so if we add the number $a$ to the numerator and the denominator, it will become $\\frac{5+a}{8+a}$. So we want to find $a$ such that\n$$\\frac{5+a}{8+a}=0.4.$$The way to do this is to get rid of the fraction. To do this, we simply multiply the expression by $8+a$, the denominator in the right hand side. (This is allowed because $8+a\\ne 0$ for any real value of $a$.)\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{5+a}{8+a}&=0.4\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad \\biggl(\\frac{5+a}{8+a}\\biggl)(8+a)&=0.4(8+a)\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 5+a&=(8+a)(0.4)\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 5+a&=3.2+0.4a\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 1.8&=0.4a\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 4.5&=a\n\\end{align*}\nSo $a=4.5$ is the answer.
