        " An infinite geometric series is a sum of terms where the first term is multiplied by a common ratio for each subsequent term. In this case, the series starts with 1, and the common ratio is $$-\\frac{2}{7} \\div 1 = -\\frac{2}{7}.$$ The formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series is \\begin{align*}S &= \\frac{a}{1-r}, \\end{align*} where $S$ is the sum, $a$ is the first term, and $r$ is the common ratio.

I hope it is correct. ### Optional Animation: If you have an animation package, you could add just a bit of animation to this video by adding a \"rolling out\" animation to the formula and variables as they appear, giving the video a bit of visual flair. For example, you could have the formula \"1/(1-r)\" roll out on screen, followed by the \"a\" and \"r\" values rolling out in turn. This can help keep the viewer engaged and make the video more visually interesting. ### Optional Movie: If you have access to a movie editing software, you could also create a 15-second movie that showcases the solution in a more visually engaging way. For example, you could start with a shot of the formula, followed by a \"zoom in\" to highlight the values plugged in, and then a \"reveal\" to show the final answer. This can be a fun and creative way to present the solution and make it more memorable for the viewer.

        " \nI can already evaluate a finite geometric series using the formula for the sum of a finite geometric series. But, I believe this is an infinite geometric series, and the formula doesn\u2019t work for it.\nThis tells me that I should look for the ratio, which is the same as the common ratio $r$. If $|r|<1$ then the series converges, and the formula for the sum is $\\frac{a}{1-r}$. In this case, $a=1$, so the common ratio $r=-\\frac25$. Since $|-2/5|<1$, the infinite geometric series converges.\nTo find the sum, I can use the formula $\\frac{a}{1-r}=\\frac{1}{1-(-2/5)}=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{7}}$."
