        " \nThe numerator has no restrictions on its values.  The denominator $x^2+4x-21 = (x+7)(x-3)$ must be nonzero.  This happens whenever $(x+7)\\neq 0$, i.e., $x\\neq -7$. Also, this happens whenever $(x-3)\\neq0$, i.e., $x\\neq 3$.  The only points these two criteria exclude as valid domain values are $x=-7$ and $x=3$, which are both extraneous solutions to the equation.  Therefore, the domain of $\\frac{x^2+10x+21}{x^2+4x-21}$ is $\\boxed{(-\\infty,-7)\\cup(-7,3)\\cup(3,\\infty)}$.  Conclusion: the domain is all real numbers except $x=-7$, $x=3$.  \n### Explanation:\nThe issue is focus on the denominator of the fraction expression $\\frac{x^2 + 10x + 21}{x^2 + 4x - 21}$. As the denominator $x^2+4x-21$ is equal to (x+7)(x-3) we need to satisfy the inequalities described in the type of situation. This means $x+7$ is not equal to 0. This implies $x$ is not equal to -7. Same thing apply for (x-3) as well. Then the domain will cover up ranges except those that make the denominator of the fraction 0. The question now is, what kind of elements of real number we can have in the expression is the ones where no matter what real number you put in that x i.e., we can put in different values but it cannot be equal to -7 or 3. This will give you $(\\infty,-7)) U (-7,3)$ U (3,$\\infty$) where -7 not included so no dot there and 3 also no dot.\nThis text-based question formulation and response model involves a booster technology of passing in the structured \u201cquestion\u201d and \u201cresponse\u201d.
