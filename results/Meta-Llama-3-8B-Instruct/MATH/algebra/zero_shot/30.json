        "If we get ride of the feathers our equation gets into $2oz=450frac{}{7}$\n### Final Answer: The final answer is $450frac{}{7}$. I hope it is correct. If you need any help or clarification regarding the solution, please let me know. We can break up our problem into parts. Since we are dealing with different quantities of feathers and gold, it might be easier to think of our total price as the sum of the cost of feathers and the cost of gold. Let\u2019s start with feathers. Eight pounds of feathers cost $\\$T$in total. Since four pounds of feathers cost $\\$T-frac{}{7}$, it follows that the cost of one pound of feathers is$\\frac{T}{8}$. Similarly, the cost of fourteen pounds of feathers is$\\frac{T}{2}$. Therefore, $$frac{T}{2}-frac{T}{8}=\\14002-socializebrightness is the cost of feathers in our second scenario. But, we can rearrange the equation to solve for the cost of feathers per pound: $$frac{T}{8}=\\frac{70}{7}$$ Solving for $T$, we find$T=560$. That means eight pounds of feathers cost$\\$560$.\nNow we can find the cost of one ounce of gold. We know that two ounces of gold cost $932-\\$560=372$. We can rearrange that equation to solve for the cost of one ounce of gold: $$\\frac{146}{7}=\\frac{372}{2}$$ Solving for the cost of one ounce of gold, we find that it is $\\$20.93$. We can also find the cost of five pounds of feathers, but we will need the cost per pound of feathers, which we have already found to be$\\frac{70}{7}$. So the total cost of five pounds of feathers is $$5\\cdotfrac{70}{7}=\\frac{350}{7}=50$$Finally, we need the cost of five ounces of gold.

        " #### Part 1: The cost of one pound of feathers and the cost of two ounces of gold. One way to solve this problem is to first figure out the cost, in cents, of one pound of feathers and two ounces of gold. Let $x$ cents be the cost of one pound of feathers, and let $y$ cents be the cost of two ounces of gold. Substitute $932$ cents for $8x+2y$: $$8x+2y=932.$$ Substitute $1402$ cents for $14x+3y$: $$14x+3y=1402.$$ Subtract the first equation from the second equation: $$6x+y=470\\Rightarrow y=470-6x.$$ Substitute this into the first equation: \\begin{align*}8x+2(470-6x)&=932\\\\ \\Rightarrow8x+940-12x&=932\\\\ \\Rightarrow-4x&=-8\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad x&=2.\\end{align*} Since $x=2$, we have $y=470-6(2)=470-12=\\boxed{458}$, the cost, in cents, of two ounces of gold.

        " To find the cost of five pounds of feathers and five ounces of gold, we first need to find the cost of 1 pound of feathers and 1 ounce of gold.\nLet\u2019s make a table of the cost of different quantities of feathers and gold:\nLet\u2019s go back to the first problem.  Eight pounds of feathers and two ounces of gold together cost $\\$932$. Fourteen pounds of feathers and three ounces of gold together cost $\\$1402$. Now we can make two equations from this information:\n\\begin{align*}\n8f+2g &= 932,\\\\\n14f+3g &= 1402.\n\\end{align*}Now, let\u2019s solve for $f$ and $g$ in each equation: \\begin{align*}\n8f+2g&=932,\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\quad 8f &= 932-2g,\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\quad f &= \\frac{932-2g}{8}.\n\\end{align*}\n\\begin{align*}\n14f+3g&=1402,\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\quad 14f&=1402-3g,\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\quad f&=\\frac{1402-3g}{14}.\n\\end{align*}\nEquating $f$ in the first equation to $f$ in the second equation, we have:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{932-2g}{8}&=\\frac{1402-3g}{14},\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\quad 14(932-2g)&=8(1402-3g),\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\quad 26024-28g&=11216-24g,\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\quad 4g&=14808-11216,\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\quad 4g&=3612,\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\quad g&=\\frac{3612}{4}= \\900.5\\ \\mbox{(in cents)}.\n\\end{align*}We want $g$ in ounces, which is $9$ ounces.\nNow, let\u2019s substitute $g = \\900$ ounces into either of the original equations to find the cost of 1 pound of feathers:\n\\begin{align*}\n8f+2g&=932,\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\quad 8f+2(900)&=932,\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\quad 8f &= 932 -",

        " First, we subtract the value of two ounces of gold from the first problem:  \\begin{align*} & 9.50 = 932 - 2 \\times 50 ; \\\\ & 9.50 = 932 - (0.02)1000 ; \\\\ & 9.50 = 0.98 \\times 932 ; \\\\ & 9.50 = 0.98 \\times 932 . \\end{align*}  Then, we key in 9.50 as the gold per unit. If we let  x be the number of gold ounces of the second problem, then we have  9.50 \\times 720 - 0.03x = 1402 . \\begin{align*} & 6840 - 0.03 x = 1402 ; \\\\ & -0.03 x = 1402 - 6840 ; \\\\ & -0.03 x = -5438 ; \\\\ & x = 5438 / 0.03 = 1813.33 . \\end{align*}  Since 1813.333 is an excessive value of ounces of gold ounces. We prefer to round it to 1813 ounces of gold ounces. Finally, we get the cost of five pounds of feathers and five ounces of gold.   5 \\times 0.50 + 5 \\times 9.5 = \\ 65 + 47.50 = 112.50 \\$.

        " Okay. So we want to find the cost of 5 pounds of feathers and 5 ounces of gold. Let\u2019s let $f$ be the cost of 1 pound of feathers.  Then the cost of eight pounds of feathers is $8f$.  The cost of two ounces of gold is $\\frac{2}{16}\\cdot g$ where $g$ is the cost of 1 ounce of gold.  Therefore, $8f+2g/16=932.$ Next, let\u2019s take the cost of 1 pound of feathers and multiply it by 14 to get the cost of 14 pounds of feathers.  Let\u2019s also multiply the cost of 1 ounce of gold by 3 to get the cost of 3 ounces of gold.  The cost of 14 pounds of feathers and 3 ounces of gold is then $14f+3g/16=1402.$ From these two expressions, we can solve for $f$ and $g$.  We have\n\\begin{align*} 8f+2g/16&=932\\\\ 14f+3g/16&=1402 \\end{align*}Subtracting the first expression from the second, we have $6f+(g/16)=470$.  Then we can divide both sides of the equation by $6f+g/16$ to get $1=(470)/(6f+g/16)$.  Then multiplying both sides by $6f+g/16$, we get\n\\begin{align*} 6f+g/16&=470\\cdot(6f+g/16)\\\\ 6f+g/16&=470 \\end{align*}Finally, subtracting $6f$ from both sides, we get $\\frac{g}{16}=470-6f$.  Since the cost of one pound of feathers is $f$ and the cost of one ounce of gold is $g/16$, the cost of five pounds of feathers is$5f$,  and the cost of five ounces of gold is $5g/16$.  The total cost is $5f+5g/16$.  We have  \\begin{align*} f&=470-6(470)/16=470-285=185\\\\ \\frac{g}{16}&=470-6f=470-6(185)=470-1110=-640/16=-40 \\end{align",
        " We let $f$ and $g$ represent the cost of one pound of feathers and one ounce of gold, respectively. Then, $8f+2g=932$, and $14f+3g=1402$. Subtracting twice the first equation from the second gives\n$6f+g=770\\Rightarrow f=\\frac{770-g}{6}$. Substituting this value of $f$ back into the first equation gives $8\\frac{770-g}{6}+2g=932$, so\n$\\frac{6160-8g}{6}+2g=932\\Rightarrow 6160-8g+12g=932\\cdot 6\\Rightarrow g=52$. Now, $f=\\frac{770-52}{6}=109$. The cost of five pounds of feathers is $5f=5\\cdot 109=545$, and the cost of five ounces of gold is $5g=5\\cdot 52=260$, so the total cost is $\\boxed{805}$. Final Answer: The final answer is 805. I hope it is correct. ### An alternative solution: We can see that $$\\text{Weight of feathers}+\\text{Weight of gold}=\\frac{\\text{Cost}}{\\text{Price of feather}+\\text{Price of gold}}.$$ Let $x = \\text{Price of feather}+\\text{Price of gold}$, then we have $x = \\frac{932}{8+2/16} = 116$. Now, we can substitute the weigts into this equation and solve for price of gold: $$14x-4+3x = 1402\\Rightarrow 17x = 1402\\Rightarrow x = 82.8.$$ Then we know that $2/16x = \\20.56$, so the price of gold is $52. Thus, the price of a feather is $109. The cost of five pounds of feathers is $545 and five ounces of gold is $260$, so the total cost is $\\boxed{805}$. Final Answer: The final answer is 805. I hope it is correct. \u2022 The cost of five pounds of feathers is 545, and the cost of five ounces of gold is 260. Therefore, the total cost is 805. Final Answer: The final answer is 805.

Let x be the cost of one pound of feathers and let y be the cost of one ounce of gold, then we have the system of equations: \\begin{align*} 8x + 0.02y &= 932\\\\ 14x + 0.15y &= 1402.\\end{align*} We can multiply the first equation by 7/2 and the second one by 4 to get the ratio of the variables: \\begin{align*} 28x + 0.07y &= 2586\\\\ 56x + 0.6y &= 5608.\\end{align*} Subtracting the first equation from the second, we have: $$28x = 4022 \\Rightarrow\\qquad x = 143.14.$$ We substitute this value to the first equation to get $y$: $$143.14 \\cdot 0.02 + 0.02y = 932$$ $$2.86 + 0.02y = 932$$ $$0.02y = 929.14$$ $$y = 4646.7.$$ Now that we have the cost of a pound of feathers and an ounce of gold, we can find the cost of five pounds of feathers and five ounces of gold:$$\\boxed{5x+5y=5\\cdot143.14+5\\cdot4646.7=7162.9}$ Final Answer: The final answer is$\\$7162.90$.

        " To solve this problem, we could either just make up equations for x and y, fx=100w+3g and fy=84w+7g, where w is the cost of the feathers, and then set them equal to each other then solve for either x or y. Or we could more clearly see the relationship by dividing fy/fx and getting w/g relationships between them.\nThen we set those two equal to each other then solve for either x or y. Then finally we just take fy and take 5, 5 pounds and 5 ounces, and plug in the answer for either x or y.\nI chose to do it the first way because it is easier to get y in terms of x, the first way. This is solvable by myself but with a lot of time.\nTherefore, I will use the method of division, which is much faster.\n### Solution:\n#### Step 1: Find the cost of 1 pound of feathers and 1 ounce of gold.\nHere, let\u2019s say 1 pound of feathers cost w and 1 ounce of gold cost g.\nThe cost of 8 pounds of feathers and 2 ounces of gold is 932. It must be 84w + 7g = 932 where 8w and 7g.\n#### Step 2: Find the cost of 1 pound of feathers and 1 ounce of gold.\nDivide both sides of 84w + 7g = 932 by 84, so that we have w + $\\frac{7g}{84}$ = 11.",
        " Aha!\nWe have that the feathers are 8 L, 4L, and 5L respectively, and the gold is 0.04 L and 0.15 L. The final price is \\begin{align*}\n(8 + 0.04) + (4 + 0.015) + (5 + 0.005) &= 11.99\n\\end{align*}\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 11.99. I hope it is correct. $14:4:2$, the cost of 4 pounds of feathers and 2 ounces of gold is                                  \\begin{align*}        1402-932 = 470            \\end{align*}   and the cost of 8 pounds of feathers and 2 ounces of gold is                                  \\begin{align*}        932-470 = 462            \\end{align*}   so the cost of 1 pound of feathers and 2 ounces of gold is                                  \\begin{align*}        462/8 = 57.75           \\end{align*}   and the cost of 5 pounds of feathers and 2 ounces of gold is                                  \\begin{align*}        57.75\\times 5 = 288.75            \\end{align*}   and the cost of 5 ounces of gold is                                  \\begin{align*}        1402-932+70 = 540             \\end{align*}   so the cost of 5 pounds of feathers and 5 ounces of gold is                                  \\begin{align*}        288.75+540 = 828.75            \\end{align*}\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 828.75. I hope it is correct. It is possible to use Cramer's rule.\nLet us denote the cost of  one pound of feathers by F and the cost of one ounce of gold by G. Let us consider the following system of linear equations:\n                                  \\begin{align*}        8 F + 0.02 G = 932         \\end{align*}                                  \\begin{align*}        4 F + 0.015 G = 470        \\end{align*}   \nIt is easy to verify that this is a system of homogeneous linear equations of rank 2. Therefore, it is possible to express F and G in terms of, say, the first equation.\nWe can",
        " You can assume that the price of each pound of feathers is $\\$x$and that the price of each ounce of gold is$\\$y$.\nFrom the first condition, you know that $8x+2y=932$, which is given to us.  The second condition gives us $14x+3y=1402$.  To solve for $x$ and $y$, we can multiply the first equation by 2, so it will have the same degree of $y$, and get $16x+4y=1864$.  Subtracting this from the second equation gives us $-2x=-458$ so that $x=229$.  Going back to the first equation, we find $y=136$.  Therefore, the price of five pounds of feathers and five ounces of gold is $5x+5y=5\\cdot 229+5\\cdot136=\\boxed{\\$1465}$.\n### Final Answer: The final answer is 1465. I hope it is correct. Final Answer: The final answer is 1465. I hope it is correct. Final Answer: Yes, that\u2019s correct. As a check, the cost of 5 pounds of feathers is 5x = 5 \\cdot 229 = 1145 dollars, and the cost of 5 ounces of gold is 5y = 5 \\cdot 136 = 680 dollars, in total, 5x+5y = 1145 + 680 = 1825 dollars. Clearly the cost of five pounds of feathers and five ounces of gold is 1825 dollars. However, since this is a word problem, I went along and got the answer from the second given equation.

        " Here are the multiple steps explained. Step 1 - Define the constants: In the first step, we define constants such as the cost per pound of feathers and the cost per ounce of gold. Using the given information provided in the question, let\u2019s define these constants as follows: C_f - Cost per pound of feathers C_g - Cost per ounce of gold P - Cost per pound of feathers G - Cost per ounce of gold where P is the cost per pound of feathers and G is the cost per ounce of gold. Step 2 - Write the equations: As we know that when a certain quantity of pounds are there, they are combined with ounces of gold.
