        " By definition, the line and the parabola intersect at only one point. It means that there is no intersection twice. There are two points when there are two intersection at same x value.\n### Formula: If the parabola intersects with the line at only one point, i.e., there is one point of intersection, we can solve for the x value. If no unique solution exists, then there are more than one or no points of intersection.\nIn general, we know that a line and parabola intersect at most at two points. But, we are looking for the condition here in which a line and parabola intersect for at most one point.

We can tell if this roots only one.\nLet's create these equations equal:\n$$(x - 2)^2 = 0$$\n$$b - 7 = 0$$\nWhen do we have only one point? When do we have the roots one?

I hope it is correct. Let me know if you need any further information. Thank you for your interest in my response. Have a good day! Fiza S. \ud83c\udf89\nI have written the post to explain this problem. The key is to find the intersection point of the parabola $y_1 = x^2 + 2x + 7$ and the line $y_2 = 6x + b$, and then ensure that there is only one intersection point by setting $b$ to a certain value. In this case, we need to set $b=11$ to make sure that there is only one intersection point. I hope it helps! Please let me know if you have any other questions or if you would like more help. \ud83d\udca1\nLet\u2019s go by the same method using the same technique: the two equations must be the same for their intersection point. The first equation is $y_1 = x^2 + 2x + 7$ and the second equation $y_2 = 6x + b$. We set $y_1=y_2$, then we get $x^2 + 2x + 7$ $=6x+b$. Move everything to one side of the equation. We get $x^2 - 4x + 7-b$= 0. Then, we need to factor the equation. Let us use the same technique with the same steps. This approach is helpful for this problem. The equation can be in the form $x^2 + 2x + 7",
        "\u00a0 \nIf we observe the equation of parabola, we can directly form it as $y_1 = (x + 1)^2 + 6$. And also the line equation of $y_2$ can be represented as $y_2 = 6(x + 1) + b \u2013 6$. Now the point of intersection is common for both the parabola and the line. We equate both the points for both the equations $$(x + 1)^2 + 6 = 6(x + 1) + (b \u2013 6)$$\n$$(x + 1)^2 + 6 = 6x + 6 + b \u2013 6$$\n$$x^2 + 2x + 1 + 6 = 6x + b$$\n$$x^2 + 2x + 7 = 6x + b$$\n$$(x^2 \u2013 4x + 7) = b$$\n$$x = 2 \u2013 \\sqrt{8}$$(as quadratic equation is equal to zero) (x^2 \u2013 4x + 7 = 0) = (functionLabel). So, at $x = 2 \u2013 \\sqrt{8}$, $6x + b = 6(2 \u2013 \\sqrt{8}) + b$ So the only intersection occurs when $b = 7$ . If you\u2019re not satisfied with the solution, kindly re-ask the question.

        " \nFirst we need to find the point of intersection of the parabola and the line. For a line and a parabola to intersect, we have to set their equations equal:\n\\begin{align*}\nx^2+2x+7&=6x+b\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x^2-4x+b-7&=0\n\\end{align*}Now we use the quadratic formula. In this case, $a=1,b=-4,c=b-7$:\n$$x=\\frac{-b+4\\pm\\sqrt{(b-4)^2-4(1)(b-7)}}{2}.$$For there to be only one solution, we require the expression under the square root to be 0 (because the square root of a non-zero number always gives two solutions). Therefore:\n\\begin{align*}\n(b-4)^2-4(1)(b-7)&=0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad b^2-8b+16-4b+28&=0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad b^2-12b+44&=0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad (b-4)(b-11)&=0\n\\end{align*}Therefore, either $b=4$ or $b=11$. But we can rule out $b=11$ since it would give us two solutions for $x$ from the quadratic equation when $b=11$. So, $b=\\boxed{4}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 4. I hope it is correct.#####",

Then, plugging in $x$ into either $x^2 + 2x + 7$ or $6x + b$, we obtain a value for $y$. The values of $x$ can be plugged into $x^2 + 2x + 7$ to get $y_1$ or $6x + b$ to get $y_2$.
