        " Let\u2019s think step by step.\n### Q: So the first thing we should do is to examine each factor.\nA: That's correct! We want to consider each part when we multiply it with another.\n### Q: So, how do you expand $(2p^2 - 1)(3p^2 + 4)$?\nA: For $(2p^2 - 1)$, we would expand each term: we can expand it as ${2p^2 - 1 = 2p^2 - (1)}$. Then we will multiply it with each term of $(3p^2 + 4)$.\n### Q: That sounds great! What will you multiply first?\nA: I will multiply $2p^2$ with $3p^2$ and then multiply it with $4$.\n### Q: That\u2019s good. What are the products?\nA: We have ${2p^2 \\cdot 3p^2 = 6p^4}$ and ${2p^2 \\cdot 4 = 8p^2}$.\n### Q: That\u2019s nice. What we have remaining is to multiply $(-1)$ with $(3p^2 + 4)$.\nA: Yes, that is correct. By multiplying $(-1)$ with $(3p^2 + 4)$, we get $-3p^2 - 4$. So, the expanded product is ${\\boxed{6p^4 + 8p^2 - 3p^2 - 4 = 6p^4 + 5p^2 - 4}}$.\n### Q: Look at the product, is it a quadratic expression?\nA: Yes, it is a quadratic expression in the form of $ax^2 + bx + c$. So, the expanded product is $(2p^2 - 1)(3p^2 + 4) = \\boxed{6p^4 + 5p^2 - 4}$. There you\u2019ve got your answer!\n### Q: Tell me is the question correct?\nA: A straightforward question from you! The question asks us to expand a product, but we are only given an expression with two terms. The terms are already in parenthesis, so we can easily expand this product by multiplying each term with the other. But, note that we are only given the product of these two binomial expressions, not three or more.\n### Q: So, the question is",

So, let\u2019s distribute $2p^2$ first:\n$2p^2(3p^2+4)=2p^2(3p^2)+2p^2(4)=6p^4+8p^2$\nNow, distribute $-1$ to the other factors:\n$(-1)(3p^2+4)=-3p^2-4$\nFinally, combine all the terms:\n$2p^2(3p^2 - 1)(3p^2 + 4)=6p^4+8p^2-3p^2-4=\\boxed{6p^4+5p^2-4}$\nAnd that\u2019s the final answer!

        " To expand the product $(2p^2-1)(3p^2+4)$, we multiply each term of the first factor by each term of the second factor. For example, we multiply $2p^2$ by $3p^2$ and by $4$ to get $6p^4$.\nNow we need to multiply $2p^2$ by $-1$. However, $-1$ is just a number, so multiplying it by $2p^2$ gives $-2p^2$. Now we have four terms: $6p^4$, $-2p^2$, $6p^2$ and $4$. We can group these terms together in the form $an^4+bn^2+c$. In our case, we have $a=6$, $b=-2$ and $c=4$. Therefore, the expansion of $(2p^2-1)(3p^2+4)$ is $\\boxed{6p^4-2p^2+12p^2+4 = 6p^4+10p^2+4}$.\n### Final Answer: The final answer is 6p^4+10p^2+4. I hope it is correct.",
