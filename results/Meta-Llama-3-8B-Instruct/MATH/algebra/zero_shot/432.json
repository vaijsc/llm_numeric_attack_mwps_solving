        " @philosophical_truth: Let\u2019s think step by step.\n $\\log_{x-1}(10-2x)=2$, what does that mean?  \nWell, that means that $10 - 2x = (x - 1) ^ 2$, since they tell us the basis is $x - 1$ in this logarithm. \nNow, can we get the expression solely in terms of $x$?  \nYes, this one: $10 = (x - 1) ^ 2 + 2x$. \nNow how can we use this information?  \nWell, the right hand side can be expanded to $(x - 1) ^ 2 + 2x = x ^ 2 + (-2) x + 1 - 2 + 2x = x ^ 2$, because all of the other terms are x terms and can be combined with $(x - 1) ^ 2$ plus 2x. \nSo what we have is $x ^ 2 = 10$.  \nAnd that will give us two solutions to the problem.  \n$x$ is either - $\\sqrt{10}$ or $\\sqrt{10}$.  \n### Note:\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{\\sqrt{10}}$ because the square root of negative number is not real number.\nInitially, there\u2019s a small mistake.

        " 1 step: The problem states that $\\log_{x-1}(10-2x)=2$.  Now, we know that $\\log_{x-1}(10-2x)=(\\log_{x-1} 10)-2(\\log_{x-1}x),$  (obtained from the properties of logarithms).  Therefore, $(\\log_{x-1} 10)-2(\\log_{x-1}x)=2$.  We now have $$(\\log_{x-1} 10)=2+2(\\log_{x-1}x).$$ 2 step: We can replace $$(\\log_{x-1} 10)=\\log_{x-1}(x-1)^{\\log_{10}(x-1)}.$$  We then obtain $$\\log_{x-1}(x-1)^{\\log_{10}(x-1)}=2+2(\\log_{x-1}x).$$  We can then replace the $\\log_{x-1}(x-1)^{\\log_{10}(x-1)}$ with $$(\\log_{x-1}(x-1))^{\\log_{10}(x-1)}.$$  Therefore, $$(\\log_{x-1}(x-1))^{\\log_{10}(x-1)}=2+2(\\log_{x-1}x).$$ 3 step: Now we have the term $(\\log_{x-1}x)^{\\log_{10}(x-1)}$.  We know that $$(\\log_{10}(x-1))(\\log_{x-1}x)=1.$$  So we can replace this with $1$ as follows $$(\\log_{10}(x-1))(\\log_{x-1}x)=1\\Rightarrow(\\log_{10}(x-1))\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\log_{x-1}(x-1)}=1\\Rightarrow1=1.$$  This simplifies to $1=1$, a true statement. Therefore, we have $$2+2(\\log_{x-1}x)=2.$$  4 step: We have arrived at a new equation.  We know that $$2+2(\\log_{x-1}x)=2.$$  So we can subtract 2 from both sides.

People nearing retirement often ask us about the best ways to get the most out of their retirement savings. The answer is simple: it's all about having a well-structured plan. Because without a clear plan, retirement savings can ebb and flow with paychecks. With a plan, your retirement savings can grow. One often-overlooked aspect of retirement planning is the role of inflation. In other words, how will your retirement savings keep pace with the rising cost of living? For people launching retirement accounts, this is a crucial consideration.lopenly Double clicking will zoomIn/ Out Even though I'm still working on my content&hellip;\nhttps:// Went to this restaurant Last night Went to this restaurant and I'm honestly surprised Excellent service, very friendly and attentive staff.
