Our goal is to determine the sum for the pairs of integers in the four formed squares, where each square's sum must be equal.\nThe integers to be used are \\( 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 \\), and their total sum is calculated as follows:\n\\[\n2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 44\n\\]\nEach square is formed by two triangles, which allows us to find pairs of integers. We need to define the pairs of triangles contributing to each square\u2019s sum based on the arrangement of triangles in the squares.\nLet\u2019s assume the triangles are positioned in the squares as follows:\n- Square 1 and Square 2 share sides with Triangle \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).\n- Square 3 and Square 4 share sides with Triangle \\( C \\) and \\( D \\).\nTo match the square pairs, we can notionally identify the sums:\n- Square 1: \\( A + B \\)\n- Square 2: \\( C + D \\)\nFor these to have the same sum \\( S \\):\n\\[\nA + B = C + D = S\n\\]\nHere\u2019s the breakdown of how we can think about the sums in detail:\n- If \\( A + B = S \\) and \\( C + D = S \\), then we can express the total sum conditioned by this layout.\n- Since the integers can be paired in different triangles but must yield equal sums, let's perform a systematic arrangement of the pairs to reveal \\( S \\).\nThe equations of the triangle sums combined should yield:\n\\[\nA + B + C + D = \\text{Total Sum} - \\text{(unused integers)}\n\\]\nSince all integers from 2 to 9 are being used, let's distribute the total into pairs.\nTo explore values of \\( S \\):\n1. Pairing smaller and larger integers is a strategy.\n2. The combinations of pairs that will yield similar sums must average out correctly.\nThe middle point or average sum of these pairs helps define \\( S \\):\nIf we take \\( 2, 9 \\), \\( 3, 8 \\), \\( 4, 7 \\), \\( 5, 6 \\)\u2014each of these pairs adds up to:\n\\[\n2 + 9 = 11 \\\\\n3 + 8 = 11 \\\\\n4 + 7 = 11 \\\\\n5 + 6 = 11\n\\]\nThus, every formed square can equal a sum of \\( 11 \\) when arranged correctly.

        " Let $x$ be the number in the square where the row and column sum four integers.\nIn each of the four squares, the sum of these integers is $x + 4$.

Hence the sum is $2 + 3 + x$.\nNext square 2, it has two equal  integers and 5 and 6. These equal integers are 3, 4, hence sum is $3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 2x$. Finally square 3, it has 2 again and 7, 8.

        " The 4 smallest squares have same sum\nAs the units are always placed in the 4 smallest squares means we have 4 possible sums. Suppose $n$ is one of the squares, then $(n + k)$ and $(9 \u2013 n)$ are other squares within that same number of squares. The sum of the three is always 12.\nTo solve this, we have:\n### Possible sum\nHere\u2019s what we know:\nAll the numbers that add up to a certain number need to have the same value as within the square. Therefore, as \u201cn\u201d is in one square, \u201cn+k\u201d is in another, and \u201c9-n\u201d is in another. In addition to this, the \u201cn-k\u201d sum in another square. Therefore, the sum we are looking for is 12.\nHere are the numbers we can use:\nFor \u201cn\u201d which we don\u2019t know, we add a value \u201cn \u201cin one square. For example values such as 4 5 or 7 are possible values.",
        " \nLet\u2019s try $4$ first.  If we put $4$ in the point (2,0) in the smallest triangle, and $5$ in the point (1,0) in the smallest triangle, then $8$ can easily go in the point (0,1) in the square.  However, $5$ now gets blocks.  So there must be a $4$ in the point (2,0) in one triangle and a $5$ in the point (0,1) in that square.  But then there must be a $5$ in the point (1,0) in the triangle, which blocks.\n### Solution:\nLet\u2019s look at one of the squares.  Suppose $n$ goes in the triangular hole.  Then the square hole gets some number $x$.  Then there is some $y$ in the third triangular hole and another $z$ on the top.  But we see that $n+x=y+z$.  Now, if we take all of these, we can see that $(n+x)+(y+z)=n+x+y+z=2n+x+y+n=x+y+z+2n$.\n### Conclusion:\nSince we know that four $n$ numbers appear in each square.  So the sum $n+x+y+z+2n=3n+x+y+z$, which is a constant sum.  So, we require $x+y+z$ to be $3n$ in order to have the same sum for all squares.\n### Final Answer:\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{15}$. I hope it is correct.  Thank you again for your post.  I hope that my response has been informative and helpful.  I will keep creating and responding to other posts in the future.

We first notice that the diagonals of the squares are the diagonals of the larger triangles. Therefore, all 4 unique vertices share the same distance from the opposite side of this larger triangle. Let\u2019s call this distance $x$. Now, let\u2019s call the square composed of side 1 & side 2 in the upper-left triangle as square. For the upper-left triangle, we have that vertex 1 & vertex 2 create a square of side length 3. Therefore, we have that $3^2 = 1^2 + 2^2$. Next, for vertex 1 & vertex 3 create a square of side length $3+1=4$. Therefore, we have that $4^2 = 1^2 + 3^2$. Next, for vertex 2 & vertex 3 create a square of side length $3+2=5$. Therefore, we have that $5^2 = 2^2 + 3^2$. Therefore, $3^2+4^2+5^2 = 9+16+25=50$. For the upper-middle triangle, we have that vertex 3 & vertex 4 create a square of side length 4.

Therefore, in either case, $a+b=4+3=7$.\nThe second square on the left, which has a triangle with one side parallel to the x-axis, has $e+f=12$, so $e, f \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\\}$ and $e \\neq f$, which means that $e = 5, f = 7$ or vice versa.\nSimilarly, the second square on the right has $g+h=12$, so $g, h \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\\}$ and $g \\neq h$.\nSo, $e = g = 5$ and $f = h = 7$ or vice versa, but this cannot be since $f = 3$.  Therefore, $e = g = 5$ and $f = g = 7$ or vice versa, but this also cannot be since the pairs in the squares are equal.\nThe third square on the left, which has a triangle with one side parallel to the y-axis, has $i+j=12$, so $i, j \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\\}$ and $i \\neq j$, which means that $i = 6, j = 6$ or vice versa.\nSimilarly, the third square on the right has $k+l=12$, so $k, l \\in \\{1, 2,",
        " \nSince $3+8=4+5=11$, one square has integers 3 and 8, and the opposite square has integers 4 and 5. Thus, the other two squares also have equal sums, so we can adjust the integers in the squares to some integers from 1 to 9, inclusive. We have 5 different cases:\nCase 1: 1+(9) gives the same sum as 2+(8)\nCase 2: 1+(9) gives the same sum as 2+(8), but the number 8 is in the top row.\nCase 3: 2+(9) gives the same sum as 1+(8)\nCase 4: 3+(9) gives the same sum as 2+(8)\nCase 5: 3+(9) gives the same sum as 2+(8), but the number 8 is in the top row.\nChecking each case will give you a contradiction in each case, which will imply that $1+9\\neq2+8$, and a similar reasoning for the other numbers. Since there are four possible \u201copposite pairs\u201d to be equal sum, we can work backwards. For example, from Case 2 (a slight variation of the same Case), we have:\nBy the same principle we have:\nSince there are four possible opposite pairs with equal sums, we find out the pair with the sum 11. It must be 3 and 8.\nWe continue doing this and eventually we can deduce that the sum 16 is also for the pair 5 and 6, which will give us another equation. Then, we just subtract the two numbers ($5-6=11\\rightarrow 5-11=6$) and we will get a certain figure that is equal to the sum of the two numbers.\nThat is, we subtract 5 with 11 which gives us -6 and we get 6.

        " We can reduce the number of possibilities for each integer by knowing the pairs in some of the smaller squares.

We have that 5, 3, and 4 must all be placed in the bottom row, so that their squares have the same sum.  We also have that 6, 2 and 7 can only be placed in the right squares.

Thus 1 is in the middle lower square.\u00a0 This gives us 2 of the squares filled.\u00a0 See figure below:\n[asy]\nsize(100);\ndraw(unitsquare);\ndraw(shift(up)*shift(right)*unitsquare);\nfilldraw(shift(up)*unitsquare,gray(.6));\nfilldraw(shift(right)*unitsquare,gray(.6));\ndot((0,0),black);\ndot((0,2),black);\ndot((2,0),black);\ndot((2,2),black);\nlabel(\"7\",(1,1),NE);\nlabel(\"9\",(1,3),NE);\nlabel(\"1\",(1,1),E);\ndot((0,1),black);\nlabel(\"1\",(1,1),N);\n[/asy]\n3.
