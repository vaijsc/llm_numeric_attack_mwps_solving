        " The given expression is $$\\frac{2s^5}{s^3} - 6s^2 + \\frac{7s^3}{s}.$$ Factoring out $s^2$ from the first and the third terms, we get $$2s^2\\cdot \\frac{s^3}{s^3} - 6s^2 + 7s\\cdot\\frac{s^2}{s}.$$ Cancelling the $s^2$ inside the fraction with $s^2$ in the terms outside the fraction, we get $$2s^2 - 6s^2 + 7s.$$ Now, we combine the $s^2$ terms to get $$2s^2 - 6s^2 + 7s = \\boxed{-4s^2+7s}.$$  So, the simplified expression is $\\boxed{-4s^2+7s}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -4s^2+7s.

        " First, I can simplify $\\frac{2s^5}{s^3}$ and $\\frac{7s^3}{s}$. We can simplify those terms by dividing the terms in the numerator and denominator by the term which appears in both:\n\\begin{aligned} \\frac{2s^5}{s^3} - 6s^2 + \\frac{7s^3}{s} &= \\frac{2s^5}{s^3} - 6s^2 + \\frac{7s^3}{s} \\\\ &=2s^2 - 6s^2 + 7s \\\\ &=\\boxed{-4s^2 + 7s} \\end{aligned}\n### Explanation:\nWhile all calculations are made in a single step, we first need to simplfy the top and bottom terms of $\\frac{2s^5}{s^3}$, by dividing by s^3. So the term simplifies to $2s^2$.\nNext, we do the same thing for $\\frac{7s^3}{s}$. We simplify it to $7s$.\nFinally, we can subtract and add the simplified terms to get the final answer $\\boxed{-4s^2 + 7s}$.\n### Alternative:\n### Practice Problems:\n    - Given that, $\\frac{x^3}{x} + 4$ simplify the expression to rationalized fraction.\n    - given the expression $\\frac{p^2 + 3p \u2013 2}{p}$\n### Information for improvement:\n(Impression rating)\n-P0F12G2\nlovely, responded to my question, clear, concise, no errors, smiled......!)!!",
