    "solution": "Since $f(g(x)) = g(x)^3 - 6g(x)^2 + 3g(x) - 4$, it suffices to identify the constant terms of $g(x)^3$, $g(x)^2$, and $g(x)$. When expanding $g(x)^3$, we notice that the only way to obtain the constant term is to multiply the constant term with $g(x)$ by itself multiple (3) times: $(-2) \\times (-2) \\times (-2) = -8$. Similarly, the constant term of $g(x)^2$ is $(-2) \\times (-2) = 4$. The constant term in $g(x)$ is $-2$. Substituting gives $(-8) - 6 \\cdot 4 + 3 \\cdot (-2) - 4 = -8 - 24 - 6 - 4 = \\boxed{-42}$.",

Therefore, we can find the constant term by plugging in $g(x)$ with $g(x) = x^3 + 5x^2 + 9x - 2$ and expand the terms. The constant term will be the coefficient of $x^0$ and will be the same as the constant term in the original function $f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 3x - 4$ which is $-4$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -4.

        " To find the constant term of the composite function $f(g(x))$, we first find the expression $g(x)=x^3 + 5x^2 + 9x - 2$ to third degree, since we know that $f(x)$ can be written in terms of $x^3$.  Let us make it easier to solve.\ng(x)=x^3+5x^2+9x-2\\\\\nSubstitute different values for x\\\\\ng(x) = x^3 + 5x^2 + 9x - 2\\\\\ng(0) = 0^3 + 5*0^2 + 9*0 - 2\\\\\ng(0) = -2\\\\\ng(1) = 1^3 + 5*1^2 + 9*1 - 2\\\\\ng(1) = 5\\\\\ng(2) = 2^3 + 5*2^2 + 9*2 - 2\\\\\ng(2) = 10+20+18-2\\\\\ng(2) = 46\\\\\nWe see that g(x) is linear in x, with function value g(0) = -2 and g(1) = 5 and g(2) = 46.  We can use that information to find f(g(x))\\\\\nf(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 3x - 4\\\\\nf(g(0)) = g(0)^3 - 6*g(0)^2 + 3*g(0) - 4\\\\\nf(g(0)) = (-2)^3 - 6*(-2)^2 + 3*(-2) - 4\\\\\nf(g(0)) = -8 - 24 - 6 - 4\\\\\nf(g(0)) = -42\\\\\nf(g(1)) = g(1)^3 - 6*g(1)^2 + 3*g(1) - 4\\\\\nf(g(1)) = (5)^3 - 6*(5)^2 + 3*(5) - 4\\\\\nf(g(1)) = 125 - 150 + 15 - 4\\\\\nf(g(1)) = -14\\\\\nf(g(2)) = (46)^3 - 6*(46)^2 + 3*(",

This is another way to prove the same claim, too.\nSo let\u2019s evaluate $g(0)$: $$g(0)=0^3+5(0)^2+9(0)-2=-2.$$And then evaluate $f$ at $-2$: $$f(-2)=(-2)^3-6(-2)^2+3(-2)-4=-8+24-6-4=6.$$The constant term of $f(g(x))$ is then $\\boxed{6}.$\n### Source:\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 6.
