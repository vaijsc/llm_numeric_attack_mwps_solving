Therefore, we need the output of $f(f(x))$ to be undefined, which means that the input of $f(f(x))$ must be undefined.  This occurs when the input is equal to $x-3$.  Therefore, the function $f(f(x))$ is undefined when $f(x)=x-3$.  To find the solution to this, we can solve $f(x)=x-3$ for $x$, as follows: \\begin{align*}\nf(x)&=x-3\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad \\frac{1}{x-3}&=x-3\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 1&=(x-3)^2\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 1&=x^2-6x+9\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 0&=x^2-6x+8\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 0&=(x-2)(x-4)\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x&=2, 4\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $g(x)=f(f(x))$ is undefined when $x=2,4$.  The largest value is $\\boxed{x=4}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is x=4.

        " Step 1: Express f(f(x)).Since f(f(x)) = \\frac{1}{f(x)-3}, we will evaluate f(f(x)) in the domains of f(x).  If f(f(x)) is not in the domain, we will try to define it manually.  After defining f(x), we will see its domain.  The domain of f(x) is x \u2260 3, denoted as D_x = {x: x \u2260 3}.  Because f(f(x)) is the inverse, f(f(x)) is also in D_x = {x: x \u2260 3}, including f(5) = 2, f(2) = 5.  Only 2 is in D_x; 5 is not in D_x.  To see what values f(x) take, let\u2019s plug in different \"x\" values into f(x):, f(f(x)) would evaluate into different \"x\" values.  You notice that f(f(x)) is rational function, whose denominator is equal to f(0) for x = 1, f(f(x)) shares the same zeros and the same numerator as f(x).  f(f(x)) is \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{x-3}-3} = \\frac{(x-3)}{1-3(x-3)} which is a rational function whose denominator gives \\frac{(x-3)}{1-3(x-3)} = \\; \\frac{x-3}{1-3x+3} = \\frac{(x-3)}{(1-3x)+3} for ratio as 1-2x in DOMAINS ONLY.  \\[= \\frac{x-3}{4-3x}.  We note that f(f(x)) is not defined when x = 4/3 (0<1), but f(x) = \\{x=4/3} doesn't exist, or f(f(x)) is not defined when x = 4/3 as a function.  f \\left(f(x)\\righ\n### Final Answer: The final answer is 4/3. I hope it is correct. ### Explanation: Because f(f(x)) is not defined when x = 4/3 (your reasoning is incorrect), but f(x) = \\{x=4/3} doesn't exist, or f(f(x)) is not defined when x = 4/3 as a function, we know that",
        " Let\u2019s do that, one step at a time. We start by calculating $f(x)=\\frac{1}{x-3}$, which implies $f(f(x))=\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{x-3}-3}$.  Simplifying, we get$$f(f(x))=x-3,$$which has the same problem as the original function $f(x)$.  Therefore, it has problems when $x=3$, when the denominator of the original function is zero.\n### ",
        " $$f( x )=\\frac{1}{x-3}$$\nSo, the domain of $f( x )$ is all real numbers except for 3.

This value would occur when $-x+4=0$, so $x=4$.\nTherefore, the largest $x$ that is not in the domain of $g( x )$ is $\\boxed{4}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 4. I hope it is correct.  \uff01\uff01\n",
        " Since $f(x)=\\frac{1}{x-3}$, $g(x)=\\frac{1}{f(x)-3}=\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{x-3}-3}$.  We have $x\\neq 3$ for the domain of $f$ and we have that the new denominator cannot be zero.

This means that $x$ cannot be greater than 1 (or less than 1) and cannot be equal to 1.  We see that the largest x that is not in the domain is $\\boxed{1}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 1. I hope it is correct.  I had to guess the problem as there were no apparent clarification request.  I should probably have asked for it.  Anyway, it looks like my answer is about right if I didn't make a mistake in my math; but, I may have.  I could be wrong.  I guess I should have asked.  The owner of this problem, please let me see your answer.  Also, is there a way to improve this problem?  Thank you.    Let's say that you want to make the domain of $f$ bigger.  You could say: Find the largest $x$ that is not in the domain of $g(x)=\\lim\\limits_{n\\rightarrow\\infty} f^{\\circ n}(x)$.

        " We start by given the function f(x)=\\frac{1}{x-3}. The domain for the function f(x) is all real numbers except for x=3. The question is asking to find the largest x not in the domain of g(x)=f(f(x)). So, we need to find f(x) by evaluating x over f(x). This would give: f(x)=\\frac{1}{f(x)-3}, which simplifies to f(x)=\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{x-3}-3}. Simplifying further, f(x)=\\frac{x-3}{2-x}. Thus, the function g(x) is given as g(x)=\\frac{x-3}{2-x}. Now, to find the domain for g(x), we need to solve for all real numbers except for those where the denominator is zero. In this case, the denominator is 2-x. Solving the problem, we get 2-x=0, which yields x=2. The question asks to find the largest x that is not in the domain of g(x). This means that we need to find the largest x greater than x=2.

        " \nFirst, we compute the expression for the inner function:\n$$f(f(x)) = f\\left(\\frac{1}{x-3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{x-3}-3}.$$\nTo find the domain of $g$, we require that the denominator in this expression is non-zero.

We see that $x=3$ is a solution, and all $x$ smaller than this solution are indeed in the domain of $g$ (none of them are strictly larger than $3$ plus $1/3$), and all $x$ larger than this solution are not in the domain of $g$ (as they are larger than $3$ plus $1/3$).
