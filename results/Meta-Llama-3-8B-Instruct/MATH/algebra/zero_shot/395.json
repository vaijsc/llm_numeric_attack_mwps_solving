So you want me to find x. The given equation is square root 3 for 2 x minus 4 / square root 3 for x plus 4. The question says that this is equal to 2. Now this is equal to square root 3 for 2 x minus 4 squared divided by square root 3 for x plus 4 squared. This is because the denominator and the numerator are multiplied by each other. So we have square root 3 for 4 x -8/ square root 3 for x plus 4 squared. This equals square root 3 for 4 equation. So we have square root 3 for 4 x minus 8 / square root 3 for x plus 4 squared. Multiply both sides by square root 3 for x plus 4. This gives us 4 x minus 8 = 2 x plus 4. Now subtract 2 x from both sides. This gives 2 x -8 = 4. Now add 8 to both sides. This gives 2 x = 12. Now divide both sides by 2. This gives x = 6.  So the final answer is x = 6. Correct or Incorrect? Let me tell.:  Yes, the solution is correct. Since given problem = $\\frac{\\sqrt[3]{2x-4}}{\\sqrt[3]{x+4}} = 2$ taking cube then we get $2x-4 = 8$, $x= 2$. Now subtract $4$ from both sides then we get $2x - 4 = 4$ implies $x = 2$.

        " We have $\\frac{\\sqrt[3]{2x-4}}{\\sqrt[3]{x+4}}=2$. Since $\\sqrt[3]{a}=b$ if and only if $a=b^{3}$, this is equivalent to the equation $\\frac{(2x-4)^{1/3}}{(x+4)^{1/3}}=2$.
