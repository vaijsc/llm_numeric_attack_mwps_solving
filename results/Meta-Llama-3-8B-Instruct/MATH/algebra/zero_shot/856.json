The formula for a geometric series is given by $a\\left[1+r+r^2+\\cdots+r^{n-1}\\right]=a\\left[\\frac{r^n-1}{r-1}\\right]$.

        " \nWe can convert $0.1\\overline{7}$ to $0.177777...$ so it becomes easier to find the common fraction:\n    $$0.1\\overline{7}=0.1777777...=0.1+0.067+0.007+0.007...$$ \n$$=0.1+0.067\\left(1+0.1+0.01+0.001+...\\right)$$ \n$$=0.1+0.067\\left(\\frac{1}{1-0.1}\\right)$$\n$$=0.1+0.067\\left(\\frac{10}{9}\\right)=\\frac{1\\cdot10+7\\cdot9}{90}=\\boxed{\\frac{85}{90}=\\frac{17}{18}}.$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\frac{85}{90}=\\frac{17}{18}. I hope it is correct. \tUsed: Well, the above method works, it's too mechanical.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\frac{85}{90}=\\frac{17}{18}. I hope it is correct.\t\t\t usters are always excited about something that is $\\boxed{\\frac{85}{90}}$% correct. \tUsed: Well, the above method works, it's too mechanical.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\frac{85}{90}=\\frac{17}{18}. I hope it is correct.enton the Math method. We can show that $x = 0.117117... = \\frac{85}{90}$ because $$90x = 10 + 6 + 0.7 + 0.07 + \\cdots + 0.007 + ...$$which is a geometric series with first term 7/9 and common ratio 1/9, so we have $$90x = 10 + 6 + \\frac{\\frac{7}{9}}{1 - \\frac{1}{9}} = 16 + \\frac{\\frac{7}{9}}{\\frac{8}{9}} = 16 + 7 = 23$$so $$x = 23/90 = 17/18.$$Remember \\frac{85}{90}=\\frac{17}{18}. I hope it is correct.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\frac{85}{90}=\\frac{17}{18}. I hope it"
