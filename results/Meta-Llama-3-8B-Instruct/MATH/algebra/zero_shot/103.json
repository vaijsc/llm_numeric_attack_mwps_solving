We can check if 20 has a factor that is the same as the coefficient of x^3 plus 1. (This is because we want to pull out a factor of the form ax+b, where a is the coefficient of x^3.) In this case, the coefficient of x^3 is 30, so we want to check if the difference between 30 and 20 has any factors that will come out. That is:\n30-20 = 10\nAnd indeed, 10 has a factor of 2, and 30 has a factor of 2.

Factoring a polynomial can be quite tricky, but sometimes breaking it down step by step can make it more manageable.\nFirst, I pointed out that the greatest common factor of all the terms is $2x$, so we can factor it out. This simplifies our expression and makes it easier to work with.\nNext, I showed that we can try factoring out the middle term of the quadratic portion, $-4x$, from the binomial $15x^2-4x+10$.

        " For simplicity, we will rewrite the polynomial in the above instruction as follows: $$30x^3 - 8x^2 + 20x.$$\n1. First, we will look at the constant term: none . So, we don't have a linear factor.\n2. Now, let\u2019s look at the quadratic term $-8x^2$. This does not seem too promising either, as it does not look like a perfect square together with the cubic term $30x^3$.\u00a0So, we look at the cubic term and find the smallest factor that divides the $x^3$ part ($30$) and the constant part ($-8$) with some diagonal propagation. This is $2$, and when we divide $30$ by $2$, we get $15$. Similarly, we have $-8\\div 2=-4$. So, we write $30x^3-8x^2+20x$ as $$15x^3-4x^2+10x.$$ This polynomial is now smaller, but not too helpful to factor. We really don't have much idea about quadratic factors here, as our quadratic term $-4x^2$ is only sum, not a difference of two squares.\n3. Now, we go back to the original problem, $30x^3 - 8x^2 + 20x$. Inspired by the fact that we introduced a factor of $2$ earlier, we might consider $2$ as a linear factor, if it divides the polynomial. Indeed, it does, since $$30x^3-8x^2+20x=(30x^3-10x^2)+(-8x^2+20x).$$ We now factor the first term, using our earlier work: $$(15x^2)(2x-1).$$ The second term is simply $(-2x)(4x+10)$. Therefore, we have: $$\\boxed{30x^3-8x^2+20x=(2x-1)(15x^2-4x-10).}$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is (2x-1)(15x^2-4x-10). I hope it is correct. (Please purposely allow some mistakes if present.)
