This means that $(x-1)$ is $7$ when $x-1$ is positive and $-7$ when $x-1$ is negative. So the equation becomes $x-1=7$ or $x-1=-7$. Solving for $x$ gives us $x=8$ and $x=1$.

The correct solution is to show that 8 is the only solution. \\\\\nThe equation |x-1|=7 can be rewritten as x-1 = 7 or x-1 = -7. If we solve the first equation, we get x = 8. If we solve the second equation, we get x = -6, but this solution contradicts the assumption x - 1 < 0, so it is discarded. So the final solution is x = 8. And the sum is 8. Finally, please keep the following in mind; a strict solution is to eliminate the other incorrect answer but in this case the alternative is complete nonsense. It is not worth mentioning.

        " We know that when we write $|x|$, we are finding the distance to zero from $x$. For example, if we take the absolute value of 3, we get $|3|=3$, because 3 is 3 lengths away from zero. Similarly, if we take the absolute value of -3, we get $|-3|=3$, because -3 is 3 lengths away from zero. Now, in the question, we have $|x-1| = 7$. When we think about this, we can realize that we have to find the values of $x$ for which $x-1$ is 7 lengths away from zero. Now, when $x-1$ is 7 lengths away from zero, it could be either 8 or -6 away.

        " $x = -6$ and $x = 8$ are the possible values for that equation.\n### Explanation:\nThe equation $|x-1| = 7$ says that the distance between $x$ and $1$ is $7$.\nIf $x$ is less than $1$, the distance between $x$ and $1$ is $x + 1$, so $|x - 1| = x + 1 = 7$ which gives $x = 6$.\nWe know that $x + 1$ can never be less than $x - 1$, so we can tell $x>1$. Trying $x = 4$ we see that it\u2019s still greater than $1$ but gives $|x-1| = 3 \\ne 7$.\nWhat we didn\u2019t say yet but will now is that the distance between two numbers can never be negative (that\u2019s what a distance is). For instance, if I am in Drexel University, my distance to Princeton University cannot be negative.\nBecause this distance is supposed to be $7$, for $x > 1$, the distance between $x$ and $1$ is actually $x - 1$.\nAnd the distance between two numbers can never be negative (as I already explained).\nSo for $x > 1$, $x - 1 = 7$ which gives $x = 8$.\nRecap: the distance between $x$ and $1$ must be $7$, and for $x < 1$, that distance is $x + 1$, and for $x > 1$, it\u2019s $x - 1$, so our two solution options are $x = -6$ and $x = 8$.",
        " There are 2 ways to do.\n**Method 1:**\nWhen $|x-1|=7,$ we can think of two possibilities:\n    - $x-1=7,$ which implies $x=1+7=8$.\n    - $-(x-1)=7,$ which implies $x-1=-7,$ meaning $x=1-7=-6$.",
        " To solve the equation $|x-1|=7$, we have to think about all the cases by which we can equal $|x-1|$ to 7. So there are 2 cases. Case 1: For $x-1 \\le 0$, we get that $x-1 = -7$ or $x = -6$. Case 2: For $x-1>0$, we get that $x-1 = 7$ or $x=8$. Since $|x-1|=|-(x-1)|$, we find $x=-6$ and $x=8$. The sum of the two values is $\\boxed{-6+8=2}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2. I hope it is correct. #algebra #inequality #calculation\nWhen the problem was solved, you got $\\boxed{-6+8=2}$; the final answer of $\\boxed{2}$. This means that the sum of the two values of $x$ where $|x-1| = 7$ is equal to 2. You are correct, and this is sufficient to end the problem.
