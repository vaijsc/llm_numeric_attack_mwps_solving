    "solution": "Alice has a $1/2$ chance of winning the game on her first turn. If she doesn't, then the probability that she wins the game on her second turn is $1/8,$ since she must not win on her first flip ($1/2$ chance), Bob must not win on his first flip ($1/2$ chance), and then Alice must win on her second flip ($1/2$ chance). The probability that she wins the game on her third turn is $1/32,$ and in general, the probability that she wins the game on her $k^\\text{th}$ turn is $(1/2)^{2k-1}.$ Thus, the probability that Alice wins is an infinite geometric series with first term $1/2$ and common ratio $1/4.$ So, the probability that Alice wins the game is $$\\frac{\\frac12}{1-\\frac14} = \\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}.$$OR\n\nNote that the only difference between the odds of Alice or Bob winning is who goes first. Because Bob goes second, the odds of him winning on his $k^\\text{th}$ flip is half of the odds that Alice wins on her $k^\\text{th}$ flip, since Alice must first get a tails before Bob gets a chance to win. Thus, if $a$ is Alice's chance of winning, and $b$ is Bob's chance of winning, then $a = 2b.$ Also, since someone must win, $a + b = 1.$ It follows that $a = 2/3$ and $b = 1/3,$ so Alice has a $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$ chance of winning the game.",

        " \nLet's analyze the situation:\nAlice starts the game. After Alice's first flip, there are two possible outcomes: Alice gets heads or tails. If she gets heads, she wins and the game ends. If she gets tails, it becomes Bob's turn. From this point on, Bob flips coins. If Bob gets tails, he wins and the game ends. If Bob gets heads, it becomes Alice's turn again and the game starts over.\nSo, the game effectively starts from the very beginning after each tails outcome in Alice's first flip. Let's define the game starting point as P. \nAt the starting point P, Alice is in a situation where Bob has just flipped tails, meaning Bob has lost. From here, Alice's probability of winning is the same as the probability that Bob wins when Bob starts the game.\nThis is because the game's situation at the starting point P is equivalent to Bob starting the game. Bob's first outcome is also tails, which leads to Alice winning. This is why we can treat the game situation at the starting point P as equivalent to Bob starting the game.\nSo, the probability that Alice wins is the same as the probability that Bob wins, which is P(Bob wins | Bob starts the game). Since the coin flip probability of heads is 0.5, the probability that Bob wins is equal to 0.5. As a result, the probability that Alice wins is also 0.5.\nIf you want to verify this visually, imagine a tree with M nodes. Each node represents a position in the game. Alice starts at the top node. From each node, there are two edges, one for heads and one for tails. Starting from the top, the game flows through the tree according to this process. The red path represents Alice's path, and the blue path represents Bob's path. After flipping heads, Alice wins, and after flipping tails, Bob wins. Based on this tree, it becomes clear that Alice has an equal probability of winning as Bob, which is 0.5.

I hope it is correct.  Suppose we allow coin flips to continue indefinitely, then it\u2019s easy to see by induction that Alice will always win the game. However, we need to be more precise and calculate the probability. \nOne way is to consider the probability tree diagram below. If Alice flips a heads, she wins. And if Bob flips a tails, ...  and so on. This problem can be modeled using a probability tree diagram. To find the probability that Alice will win, we need to take the sum of all the probabilities in the middle of the tree since Alice wins if and only if a line in the tree ends in \"Alice wins\". \nThe sum of all the probabilities in the tree ends in \"Alice wins\" is 3/4, so Alice has a probability of winning of 3/4.  Therefore, the answer is 3/4. \nThis problem shows how a probability tree diagram can be used to help solve problems in probability theory.  It also shows how we can model a process using a tree diagram and then solve it algebraically.  For example, we could use recursion to find the probability of winning in the following way: \np(A) = P(head) + P(tail)*P(A)  In this case, the \"tail\" probability is the probability of Bob winning and then it becomes Alice's turn, which is p(B) = P(tails). So  p(A) = P(head) + P(tails)*p(A)  The solution to this equation is p(A) = 3/4. \nWe then have to calculate the probability of a tail when it is Bob's turn and that is 1/2. So the overall probability is p(A) = 1/2 + (1",

        " If the first toss results in 1 (because it's Alice's turn), and the second toss results in 1, then Alice wins. In this case, the probability is easily found by the probability of 1 (the desired outcome). If the first toss results in 1 but the second 0, then Bob is now Bob's turn.\n    Bob can now win if the 3rd toss results in 0. In this case, if he wins, all the previous tosses were weak tosses.\n    But the question asked is what's the probability that Alice wins. So the probability here is the probability of 0 * the probability of Bob winning, which is 0, because Bob will win if the next outcome is 0. \n    - So we get rid of Bob's winning case.\n    - In all Bob's winning cases (other than the only one he loses it he won before), his first winning role does not belong to him.\n    So there's no such step which we need to take to calculate the probability.\nSo, the probability that Alice wins is simply 1/2.",
        " Let\u2019s think step by step.\nInitial Probability that Alice wins:\nAlice starts with a 50% chance of winning (since the coin is fair). If the coin lands heads up, she wins. If it lands tails up, it becomes Bob\u2019s turn, and his chance of winning is again 50%. So, the probability of Alice winning is 0.5 * (1) = 0.5.\nNext, Alice loses this turn (tails). Bob\u2019s chance of winning becomes 0.5 * (1) = 0.5.\nAlice has lost, and it\u2019s Bob\u2019s turn. Now, if Bob wins (tails), Alice has lost.\nNow, Alice wins (heads).\n### Therefore, the probability that Alice wins the game is:\n0.5 * 0.5 + 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.5. Therefore, the probability that Alice wins the game is 0.5.\nThis makes sense since, although the coin is flipped multiple times, the coin is still fair, so the probability of Alice winning after Bob has had a turn (and so on) is equal to the probability of Alice winning initially.\n### Can you write the answer in a formula?\nProbability of Alice winning after n turns:\nA(n) = 0.5 * A(n - 1) + 0.5 * 1\nA(n) = (0.5)^(n + 1)\nSo, the probability of Alice winning the game is A(\u221e), which approaches 0.5 as the number of trials becomes infinite.\nSo, the final answer is A(\u221e) = 0.5.\n### End of ",
        " \nIn a game played for a long time, we can think intuitively that the probability of getting a heads in the next turn is $\\frac12.$ Similarly, if we are in a turn where a flip already occurred and we know that it wasn't a tails, then the probability of getting a heads in the next turn is also $\\frac12.$\nSo, if the first player is doing well, let\u2019s say she flipped $n$ heads in a row. There are two possible outcomes in the next flip: either she flips a heads again and wins, or she flips a tails. If she flips a heads again, then we can simply discard the last $n$ turns, because the first $n-1$ turns don\u2019t affect the probability anymore. If she flips a tails, then the game reverts to a new starting point. So, the probability that Alice wins is\n$$\\frac12\\cdot\\frac12+\\frac12\\cdot\\frac12+\\cdots=\\frac12$$\nHence the probability that Alice wins is $\\boxed{\\frac12}.$\nNote that this is also the intuitive interpretation of the geometric distribution, where $\\frac12$ represents the probability of a single flipped heads.",

        " \n1. Alice flips a coin, and the chance of getting heads is 50%.\n2. If Alice gets heads, she wins, with a probability of 100%. If not, it becomes Bob\u2019s turn.\n3.

Therefore, given that Alice didn't win on her first turn, the probability that Bob wins is 50%.\n5. Since the game ends after one round (either Alice wins or Bob wins), and Alice wins on her turn but not after that, the probability that Alice wins is equal to the opposite of the probability that Bob wins, which is 50%.\nSo, the probability that Alice wins the game is 50%.

        " Alice starts the game by flipping a coin.  Heads (or H) gets Alice win. Since the game is played fairly, we assume that H and T (tails) are both 50% probable when Alice flips the coin. So probability of Alice winning in this round is P = (1/2), which is 50%.\nNow let the coin flip sequence until Alice's next turn: HTHHTHTH\u2026 (Sequence length increases as the game continues. Remember, H means Alice wins, and T means it becomes Bob's turn.)\nThe probability that the game becomes a never-ending series of T\u2019s starting from the second turn is zero. Why? The sequence will eventually end since there are two winning ending states (Alice or Bob can win).\nIf we disregard this 0-probability case, we can calculate the expected probability that the game continues for N more turns. To do this, we must know when Alice wins.\nIn the sequence, each \u201cH\u201d is a winning state for Alice. The probability of H still holds (1/2), and with each turn, this probability remains (1/2). So we can sum up the probability of exactly finding the nth H in the sequence. The sum of these probabilities (from 0 to infinity) gives us the probability that Alice wins.\nThe expected number of coin flips until Alice wins is based on the geometric distribution, which is shown below:\nFor the first flip, the probability of Alice winning is (1/2). For the second flip, it\u2019s still (1/2). So on.\nThe series of P(H) values is geometric, and we can write the expected value, i.e., the average number of coin flips before Alice wins, as 1 / (1/2) = 2.\nNow, we can solve for the probability that Alice wins by using the formula for the probability density function of a geometric distribution:\nf(x) = (1/2)^x\nwhere x is the sequence length (number of coin flips).\nThe cumulative distribution function (CDF) is the sum of all the values up to a given x:\nF(x) = P(X <= x) = 1 - (1/2)^x.\nTo find the probability that Alice wins, we look for the limit as x approaches infinity:\nP(Alice wins) = lim (x -> \u221e) 1 - (1/2)^x\n= 1.\nSo, the probability that Alice wins the game is **1**, or **100",
        " \nThis problem is actually a classic problem related to conditional probability.\nLet's define the probability space $(\\Omega, F, P)$:\n- $\\Omega$ is the sample space, which contains all the possible outcomes of the game. Since there are two players and each player flips a coin for two turns, then $\\Omega$ should contain $4$ outcomes: $(HH), (HT), (TH), (TT).$\n- $F$ is the event space, which is the set of all events in the probability space. In this case, $F$ consists of $4$ singleton sets $\\{HH\\}, \\{HT\\}, \\{TH \\}$, and $\\{TT\\}.$\n- $P$ is the probability measure, which assigns a probability to each event in $F$. In this case, since there are two coins with equal probability of heads or tails, then the probability of each outcome is $\\frac{1}{4}.$\nNow, we can find the probability that Alice wins the game. Let $A$ be the event that Alice wins, and $T$ be the event that the game is terminated. We can calculate the probability of $A$ with the following formula:\n$$P(A) = P(A \\cap T) + P(A \\cap T^C).$$Since the game will terminate at some point, then $P(T) = 1.$ Therefore, we only need to calculate $P(A \\cap T)$ and $P(A \\cap T^C).$\nFor $P(A \\cap T)$, Alice wins when the game is terminated on her turn. This happens when the first coin landed on heads. The probability of that event is $\\frac{1}{4}.$\nFor $P(A \\cap T^C)$, Bob wins when the game is terminated on his turn. This happens when the first two coins landed on tails. The probability of that event is $\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{16}.$\nSo, the probability that Alice wins the game is:\n$$P(A) = P(A \\cap T) + P(A \\cap T^C) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{16} = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}}.$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\frac{3}{4}.

        " \nFirst, let\u2019s analyze one turn of the game. There are two outcomes for each coin flip. Let\u2019s say Alice flips a coin first. There is a $\\frac{1}{2}$ probability of a heads and a $\\frac{1}{2}$ probability of a tails. Suppose Alice flips a heads. Then she wins immediately, so the probability of her winning the game immediately (given that she starts) is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\nNow suppose Alice flips a tails. Then it becomes Bob\u2019s turn. Again, there is a $\\frac{1}{2}$ probability of Bob flipping a tails, which means he immediately wins, and a $\\frac{1}{2}$ probability of Bob flipping a heads, which means the game has not yet ended.\nSo, once Alice flips a tails, the probability that the game ends on Bob\u2019s turn is $\\frac{1}{2}$, and the probability that the game continues is $\\frac{1}{2}$. If the game does continue, there will be another turn, and another turn, and so on.\nNow we can use the concept of conditional probability to find the probability that Alice wins. For Alice to win, either she wins immediately (with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$) or she wins after an even number of turns. Note that after an even number of turns, the probability of the game ending on Alice\u2019s last turn is $\\frac{1}{2}$. Therefore, the probability that Alice wins after an even number of turns is $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2$ .",
        " \nSuppose first, Alice gets a heads. Then Alice wins.  So, the probability of Alice winning given she gets a heads is 1 (because it is certain).\nThe probability of Alice getting a heads is $\\frac{1}{2}$, because it is a coin flip.\nNow suppose Alice does not get a heads on her first turn. Then Bob gets a chance. The probability that Bob gets a tails on his turn is $\\frac{1}{2}$, because it is another coin flip. If Bob gets a tails, he wins.\nIf Bob does not get a tails on his turn, then Alice gets another chance. Again, the probability that Alice gets a heads on her next turn is $\\frac{1}{2}$, because it is another coin flip. If she does get a heads, she wins.\nUsing the same logic, Alice has a $\\frac{1}{2}$ chance of winning on each of Bob's turns that Alice could possibly win (conditional on Bob not winning on his turn).\nSince these events are mutually exclusive, we can add their probabilities to find the total probability that Alice wins:\n$P(\\text{Alice wins}) = P(\\text{Alice gets heads}) + P(\\text{Alice does not get heads}) \\cdot P(\\text{Bob gets tails}) \\cdot P(\\text{Alice wins on next turn}) + P(\\text{Alice does not get heads}) \\cdot P(\\text{Bob does not get tails}) \\cdot P(\\text{Alice wins on next turn})$\n$= P(\\text{Alice gets heads}) + P(\\text{Alice does not get heads}) \\cdot P(\\text{Bob gets tails}) \\cdot P(\\text{Alice gets heads}) + P(\\text{Alice does not get heads}) \\cdot P(\\text{Bob does not get tails}) \\cdot P(\\text{Alice gets heads})$\n$= (\\frac{1}{2}) + (\\frac{1}{2}) \\cdot (\\frac{1}{2}) \\cdot (\\frac{1}{2}) + (\\frac{1}{2}) \\cdot (\\frac{1}{2}) \\cdot (\\frac{1}{2})$\n$= \\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\frac{3}{4}.
