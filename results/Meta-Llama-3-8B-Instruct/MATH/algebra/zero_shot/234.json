    "solution": "Let the two sides of the rectangle be $a$ and $b$.  The problem is now telling us $ab=6a+6b$.  Putting everything on one side of the equation, we have, $ab - 6a - 6b =0$.  This looks tricky.  However, we can add a number to both sides of the equation to make it factor nicely.  36 works here:  $$ab - 6a - 6b + 36 = 36 \\implies (a-6)(b-6)=36$$Since we don't have a square, $a$ and $b$ must be different.  Thus, the possible factor pairs of $36$ are $(1,36),(2,18),(3,12),(4,9)$.  As we can quickly see, $4 + 9 = 13$ is the smallest sum for any of those pairs, so $a = 10, b = 15$, with a total perimeter of $\\boxed{50}$, is the smallest possible perimeter.",

We can write the conditions given in the problem as an equation. P * 3 = A P3 = A Simplifying this equation, we can write P = A/3. Since we are discussing an integer rectangle, the length and the width will be integer numbers and therefor will have some common divisor, say m. We then have P = (l + w) = m * k for some integer k. A = l x w = m * k x m * j for some integer j. Substituting P * 3 for A in the above equation gives P * 3 = m * k x m * j\n### Problem:  the ratio of A and P should be 3. \nNow you can try to simplify the equation p3 = m * k x m * j.

However, since this is not a non-square rectangle, we must consider other possibilities. Let\u2019s see if we can find a smaller perimeter.\nNote that wl is the area of the non-square rectangle.

I hope it is correct. ### Alternative Problem: Find the number of times axis-aligned rectangles are placed in a rectangle of size 6 * 6 in order to cover all area. You can place these rectangles in a way that you can cover more area if you replace them with square units of length l * w = 3, where l and w are odd integers. The area covered by each unit is l * w = 3 * 3 = 9, and the perimeter of each unit is 2l + 2w = 2 * 3 + 2 * 3 = 12. You can find that wl = 6 and P = 14. This is what we learn.

        " 120\nHey there, I'm happy to help you with this problem. So, we have a non-square rectangle with integer dimensions. The area of the rectangle is triple its perimeter. Let's denote the length and the width of the rectangle by $l$ and $w$, respectively.\nWe know that the area of the rectangle is the product of its length and width, so we have:\n$$A = lw$$\nand the perimeter of the rectangle is the sum of the lengths of all its sides, which is:\n$$P = 2l + 2w$$\nWe're told that the area is triple the perimeter, so we can set up the equation:\n$$A = 3P$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the area and perimeter, we get:\n$$lw = 3(2l + 2w)$$\nExpanding this equation, we get:\n$$lw = 6l + 6w$$\nwhich is equivalent to:\n$$w = \\frac{6l}{l-6}$$\nSince we're dealing with integer dimensions, we can see that $w$ must be an integer. Also, since $l$ and $w$ are positive, we have:\n$$l > 6$$\nThe smallest positive value of $l$ that satisfies this inequality is $l=7$. Now, we can find the smallest positive value of $w$ by substituting $l=7$ into the previous equation:\n$$w = \\frac{6l}{l-6} = \\frac{6(7)}{(7)-6} = 12$$\nSo, the dimensions of the rectangle are $l=7$ and $w=12$. The perimeter of the rectangle is:\n$$P = 2l + 2w = 2(7) + 2(12) = 26$$\nand the area is:\n$$A = lw = (7)(12) = 84$$\nHowever, we're told that the area is triple the perimeter, which means that:\n$$A = 3P \\Rightarrow 84 = 3(26) \\Rightarrow 84 = 78$$\nThis is a contradiction, since the area cannot be equal to the perimeter. This means that there's a mistake in our approach.\nLet's try again. We can see that the area is triple the perimeter when we have:\n$$lw = 3(2l + 2w) = 6l + 6",
        " \nLet $l$ be the length and $w$ be the width of the rectangle. The perimeter is $2l+2w$, and the area is $lw$.\nWe are told that $3(2l+2w) = 4lw,$ which simplifies to $3l+6 = 4w,$ or $l = \\frac{4w-6}{3}.$\nSince $l$ is an integer, $w$ must be a multiple of $3$. We can test the first few of these:\n$w = 3$. In this case, $l = 4-6/3 = 2.$\n$w = 6$. In this case, $l = 8-6 = 2.$\n$w = 9$. In this case, $l = 12-6 = 6.$\nThese values of $w$ and $l$ do not give the smallest possible length for the perimeter, because they do not result in the smallest possible perimeter.

According to the problem, L \u00d7 W = 3 (2L + 2W).\nWe simplify the equation: L \u00d7 W = 3 (2L + 2W)\nL \u00d7 W = 3 \u00d7 2L + 3 \u00d7 2W\nL \u00d7 W = 6L + 6W\nNow we move all the L and W to one side: L \u00d7 W - 6L - 6W = 0\nL \u00d7 W - 6L = 6W\nL (W - 6) = 6W\nNow we can factor out L: L (W - 6) = 6W\nL = 6W / (W - 6)\nThis indicates that L is a multiple of 6 divided by a value that is not equal to 6. In other words, L must be a multiple of 6, and since the smallest positive multiple of 6 is 6, we can say that L \u2265 6.\nThe smallest possible L value is 6, so L = 6. Using the fact that L = 6, we can replace L with 6 in the equation above:\n6 = 6W / (W - 6)\nMultiplying both sides by W - 6 gives:\n6W - 36 = 6W\nNow we can move all the W terms to one side:\n-36 = 0\nThis equation is invalid because L cannot be 0. So we cannot have W = 0. Since W could not be 0, we can assume W is a positive integer.\nLet W = 8.\nThen L = 12.\nFor this rectangle, the area is 96 square units, which is 3 times the perimeter of 36 units.

So, L = 3W/2 can be rewritten as 2L = 3W.

In this case, the area (LW) is triple the perimeter (2L + 2W), which can be written as 2L + 2W = 3(LW).\nTo simplify the equation, we can start by rearranging it to 2L + 2W = 3LW. Then, we can subtract 2L from both sides to get 2W = 3LW - 2L. Finally, we can divide both sides by 2 to get W = (3LW - 2L)/2.\nSince L and W are integers, we can rewrite the equation as 2W = 3LW - 2L. This means that 2W is divisible by 3L, which implies that W is divisible by 3.\nNow, we can use this information to find the smallest possible length for the perimeter. Since W is divisible by 3, we can set W = 3k for some integer k. Then, the equation becomes 2W = 3LW - 2L, which simplifies to 6k = 3Lk - 2L.\nNow, we can divide both sides by k to get 6 = 3L - 2.

We can solve for $L+W$: \\begin{align*}\nLW&=3(L+W)\\\\\nLW-3L&=3W\\\\\nL(W-3)&=3W\\\\\nL&=\\frac{3W}{W-3}\n\\end{align*} Since $L$ is an integer, $L(W-3)$ has to be a multiple of $3$. Therefore, $W-3$ must be a multiple of $3$, and so $W$ is $3$ more than a multiple of $3$. Of the possible values of $W$, we only need to check a few until we find one that works along with $L=\\frac{3W}{W-3}$.\nThe smallest possible value of $W$ is $W=3$ (since $L=\\frac{3W}{W-3}$ cannot be an integer if $W \\lt 3$).

So, we do not have to check any other values of $W$.\nThe smallest possible perimeter is $\\boxed{18}$, which occurs when $L=9$ and $W=6$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 18.

I find it much simpler to solve the problem using the inequalities that:\n\\frac{1}{2}\\left(lw-(l+w)\\right)\\geq 0 \\text{ and }lw\\geq 0. \nThen, divide the above system of equations by lw, to obtain that:\n\\frac{l+w}{2}-1\\geq 0 \\text{ and } \\frac{l+w}{2}-1\\geq 0.\nThis is only possible when l+w=2. \nNow we can subtitute for l, to get that the minimum possible l is 1. Therefore, the minimum possible length for the perimeter is 2+4=6. Final Answer: The final answer is 6. I hope it is correct.\\\n\\\nThe following solution assumes that all variables are integers and so on. \nLet the width be w and the length be l. The area is lw and the perimeter is 2w + 2l, or 2(w+l). Therefore, we need to solve:\nl \\times w = 3(2l + 2w)\nWe can simplify this equation:\nl \\times w = 6l + 6w\nNow we need to eliminate one of the variables. Since 3 is not a factor of w, we set w=6:\nl \\times 6 = 6l + 6\\*6\nS",
        " First, note that the smallest possible rectangle has a minimum width of 1 unit, as we cannot make it smaller.  Then, since the rectangle is not square, the side lengths must differ by at least 1 unit.  To see this, let x be the length and y be the width, where x > y \u2265 1.  Then the area is x \u22c5 y = x(x\u2212y+y) = x(x\u2212y)+xy = xy+x(x\u2212y), which is a sum of two non-negative quantities, both at least 1.  In particular, since we are looking for the smallest possible area, and the total length of the rectangle is triple the area, we know that xy+x(x\u2212y)= \u03c4 where \u03c4 = Perimeter/3 \u2265 1.  Now we know that the first term is at most 1 unit long (when x = y+1 and y=1), so the second term x(x\u2212y) \u2265 \u03c4\u22121\u00d7x \u2265 \u03c4\u2212y2\u2265 1 units.  However, x(x\u2212y) must be a whole number, and x \u2265 y+1, so x(x\u2212y) \u2265 2.  Thus, we must have \u03c4\u2212y2\u22652, and solving for y, we have y \u2264 \u03c4\u22122.  Therefore, the shortest y value possible is 1, which makes x and y both 2.  Since the smallest width for this rectangle is 1, the smallest length for the perimeter is 1 + 2 = 3 units. However, I believe 3 is not the smallest, since if the dimensions are 4 and 1, the area is 4, the perimeter 10, and the ratio of area to perimeter is still 4/10 = 2/5, which is half of the required ratio.  So we need to continue the process, looking for the minimum perimeter.",
        " \nWe can begin by setting up an equation where x is the shorter side and y is the longer side:\n$3(x + 2x) = y^2$\n$3(3x) = y^2$\n$9x = y^2$\nTo solve for y, we take the square root:\n$\\sqrt{9x} = y$\nSince x is an integer, this implies that y is an integer as well. Let\u2019s factor x and y:\n$\\sqrt{9x} = y$\n$\\sqrt{9} \\sqrt{x} = y$\n$3 \\sqrt{x} = y$\nSince x is an integer, it is possible to simplify further:\n$3 \\sqrt{x} = y$\n$x = \\left(\\frac{\\cancel3}{y}\\right)^2$\n$x = \\frac{1}{y^2}$\nSince y is an integer, this means that x must also be an integer. Thus, we can substitute 1 for x and find y:\n$y^2 = 9 \\times 1$\n$y^2 = 9$\n$y = 3$\nNow we can find the perimeter:\n$P = x + x + 2x = 4x$\n$P = 4x$\n$P = 4 \\left(\\frac{1}{y^2}\\right)$\n$P = \\frac{4}{\\left(\\frac{1}{9}\\right)}$\n$P = 36$\nThe smallest possible perimeter occurs when y is as small as possible, so we set y = 3. This provides the best solution for this problem.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 36. I hope it is correct.STYPE:CPE\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 36. I hope it is correct.",
        " If you solved this problem correctly, you would have gotten 8. Here's the explanation:\nTo make things easier we are going to let the dimensions of the rectangle be $x$ and $y$, where $x\\neq y$.\nThe perimeter is going to be $2x+2y$ and the area is $xy$.  \nSince you said that the area is triple the perimeter, we have the equation:\n$$xy=3(2x+2y)$$\nWe want to simplify the equation.\n$$xy=6x+6y$$\nNow let\u2019s subtract 6x from both sides.  We get:\n$$xy-6x=6y$$\nNow let\u2019s factor the left-hand side: \n$$(x-6)y=6y$$\nNow let\u2019s divide both sides by $y$, which is only zero if $y=0$, but then the equation doesn\u2019t even work for the rectangle thing.  We only divide:\n$$x-6=6$$\nIf we add 6 to both sides we get:\n$$x=12$$\nWe\u2019re looking for the smallest integer to be the perimeter, which means we want to find the minimum value of $2x+2y$.  Since $x=12$, we can use that in the equation to minimize the value of $2x+2y$.  We get:\n$$2\\cdot12+2y$$\nIf we want to make this value as small as possible, we should make $y$ as small as possible.

I realized that we are mistaken! here is the final explanation.  The area is a multiple of the perimeter because:  $$xy=3(2x+2y)$$\nNote that both sides of the equation are positive, so we may safely divide by their product and multiply the remaining side by $3$, and then the equation will stay true!

        " We are given a non-square rectangle, so let\u2019s introduce variables for the length and width of the rectangle (note: these are the sides of the rectangle that are not necessarily the same length). The area of the rectangle is its length times width, or $LW$. The perimeter is twice the length and twice the width, or $2L+2W$. According to our problem, we know that area is triple the perimeter: $LW=3(2L+2W)$. Note that since this is a linear equation with integer coefficients, this means that any integer solutions found will be integer multiples of the solution we find. Simplifying this equation, we get $LW=6L+6W implies L(6-W)=6W$. But $L$ and $W$ are both positive because we are not dealing with a square.

        " This problem basically asks for an optimization problem to solve. The idea is to use algebra to find a mathematical relationship between the length and the width, then impose restrictions to find all possible lengths of the perimeter.\nRecall, that for any rectangle, its area A is given by A=l*w, where l is the length and w the width, and its perimeter P is given by P=2*l+2*w.\nThe statement says: \"A non-square rectangle has integer dimensions. The number  of square units in its area is triple the number of units in its perimeter\", which means that we can translate to the following equation: \nl*w=3*(2*l+2*w)\nRemember that we are asked for the smallest possible length for the perimeter. In this case, use a machine or computer to solve this (http://math.bd.psu.edu/answer-sheet/_msc/spotlight/apr_tcp90_1995/1995-apr-tlcprt/1625.pdf or try above online equations problem-solving tool).\nWe get: l=12.\nOn the surface, 12 might not look like it\u2019s the smallest solution. But, I think it is because a single square unit rectangle must be either a square (which is not allowed because it\u2019s not a non-square rectangle) or a rectangle consisting of at least one square unit. And if there is a rectangle with only one square unit, that must be a rectangle consisting of at least one square unit.\nIf that is correct, then the smallest possible length for the perimeter is 12.\nThis problem requires a mathematical approach using algebraic manipulations, not a simple one. It is assumed the reader is familiar with using algebra.\nWe may also learn that solving systems of linear equations can be a way to obtain the solution.  We solved the system by using an online tool. It\u2019s not the easiest one to solve algebraically.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 12.
