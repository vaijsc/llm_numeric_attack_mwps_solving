        " \\[x^{{(x+1)}^x}\\] is equal to: \\[2^{{(2+1)}^2}\\]\nReplace x by 2.\n### ",
        " First,\nWe have $x=2$, and let\u2019s put it in. Then $x^{{(x+1)}^x}=2^{({(2+1)}^2)}=2^{({(3)}^2)}=2^9$.\n### Final Answer: The final answer is 2^9=512. I hope it is correct.",
        " \n\\[x^{{(x+1)}^x} = 2^{{(2+1)}^2} = 2^{{3}^2} = 2^9 = 512\\]\\\\\nTherefore, the answer is $512$.",
        " \nI'm going to start by replacing $x$ with $2$.\n\\begin{align*}\n\\left[x^{\\left(x+1\\right)^x}\\right]_{x=2}\n&=\\left[2^{\\left(2+1\\right)^2}\\right]\\\\\n&=\\left[2^{\\left(3\\right)^2}\\right]\\\\\n&=\\left[2^{9}\\right]\\\\\n&=\\boxed{512}\n\\end{align*}\n### Explanation: \nHere\u2019s the step by step evaluation:\n1. Replace $x$ with $2$: \\[2^{\\left(2+1\\right)^2}=2^{(3)^2}\\] This simplifies to $2^9$.\n2. Finally, evaluate $2^9$: $\\boxed{2^9 = 512}$.\n### End: \nFinal Answer: The final answer is 512.
