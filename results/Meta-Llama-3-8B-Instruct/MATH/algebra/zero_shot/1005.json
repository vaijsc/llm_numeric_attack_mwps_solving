        " First, split the LHS as $(y+x)/(xy) = 1/z$.Therefore, we get the equation $y+x=yz$. Since we are given that $x = 25$, $y+x=yz \\Rightarrow y+25=24y\\Rightarrow y=25/23$. Substitute $x$ and $y$, and the answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{25}{23}}$.\n### Explanation:\nLet\u2019s rewrite the equation\n$$\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} = \\frac{1}{z}$$\nUsing common denominator, we can rewrite it as\n$$\\frac{y+x}{xy} = \\frac{1}{z}$$\nThe trick here is to recognize that $\\frac{y+x}{xy}$ can be written as $\\frac{1}{y} + \\frac{1}{x}$ which is equal to $\\frac{1}{z}$.\n$$\\frac{1}{y} + \\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{1}{z}$$\nBut what does this mean? Well, it means that the $\\frac{1}{z}$ on the right is a common case for all terms on the left. And so, we can rewrite what we have as:\n$$\\frac{y+x}{yz} = 1$$\n$$y+x = yz$$\nWhich can be rewritten as\n$$y = xz - x$$\nPlugging in the values given, we get:\n$$y = 24\\cdot25 - 25$$\n$$y = \\frac{25}{23}$$\nSo, we get our final answer: $\\frac{25}{23}$. You could also get this by working backwards, first by solving for y from $y+x = yz$, and then plugging the $z$ value and $x$ value into that equation.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 25/23.

        " \nIf $\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} = \\frac{1}{z}$, then we have to solve for $y$ given $x$ and $z$.

Next, let\u2019s make the right side of the equation a common denominator, so it becomes $24 \\left(\\frac{1}{25} + \\frac{1}{y}\\right) = 1$.\nThis is as far as we can simplify the equation for now. Now, we can think about solving for $y$. In the equation $24 \\left(\\frac{1}{25} + \\frac{1}{y}\\right) = 1$, we have an expression on the left side.\n### Step 2: Solve for $y$.\nWe have an expression on the left side of the equation $\\frac{1}{25} + \\frac{1}{y} = \\frac{1}{24}$, which is hard to solve directly.
