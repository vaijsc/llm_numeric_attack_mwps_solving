        " \nTo find the roots of the polynomial $p(x) = x^2 + ax + b$, we need to find the values of $x$ such that $p(x) = 0$. By the factor theorem, we know that if $r$ is a root of $p(x)$, then $x-r$ divides $p(x)$. Therefore, we can write $p(x) = (x - 2a)(x - b)$, for some $a, b \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Expanding this product, we get\n$$p(x) = x^2 - 2ax - bx + 2ab = x^2 + ax + b,$$as required. Since $p(x)$ has distinct roots $2a$ and $b$, the constant coefficient of $p(x)$, namely $2ab$, must be equal to the constant coefficient of $p(x)$, namely $b$. Therefore, $2ab = b$, so $b = 0$, $2a = 0$, or $b = 2a$. We know that $b \\neq 0$ because otherwise the polynomial has no constant term, and hence no constant term, which is absurd. Therefore, $2a = 0$ or $b = 2a$. If $2a = 0$, then $a = 0$, but $a$ cannot be $0$ because otherwise $p(x)$ does not have a linear term. Hence, $b = 2a$, and we can plug this in to determine $a$ and $b$. In this case, we have\n$$p(x) = x^2 + 2a^2x + 4a^2 = (x + a)^2.$$Therefore, we can clearly see that $a = \\pm 2$, but both choices yield the same value of $a + b = \\pm 4$, as required.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 4.

Now to factor a quadratic expression, the product of the binomials has to be the same as the quadratic, and the sum of their coefficients multiplied by the constant term of the quadratic has to be the same as the linear term of the quadratic.\nEquate the expansions and we then get: \n(x - 2a)(x - b) = x^2 + ax + b\nx^2 - (2a + b)x + 2ab = x^2 + ax + b\nNow, the degrees are the same, so coefficients for x^2 must be the same: \n- (2a + b) = a \n- 2ab = b\nNow solve these equations: 2a + b = -a\n3a + b = 0\n3a = -b\na = -b/3\n3a = -b\nb = -3a\na = -b/3\nPutting these values into the first equation: \n2a + b = -a\n2a + (-3a) = -a\n-a = -a\nSo it seems to be correct so far.",

Therefore, $a=-(2a+b)$ and $b=2ab$. From the second equation, $b=2ab$, so $a=0$ or $b=0$. \nSuppose $a=0$ then $b=0$ as well, which implies the quadratic equation has no roots.
