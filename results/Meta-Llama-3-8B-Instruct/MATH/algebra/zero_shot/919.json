        " Let\u2019s first find $f^{-1}(x)$. We find that $y=\\dfrac{a}{x+2}$ is equivalent to $x+2=\\dfrac{a}{y}$. Multiplying both sides by $y$, we obtain $y(x+2)=a$, so $xy+2y=a$. Subtracting $2y$ from both sides gives $xy-a+2y=0$. Subtracting $a$ from both sides gives $xy+2y-a=0$. Factoring gives $y(x+2-a)=0$. Since $y$ is not equal to $0$ for all $x$, it must be that $x+2-a=0$. So, $x+2=a$, and so $x=a-2$. Therefore, $f^{-1}(x)=a-2$.\n### ",

        " 1. First, we solve for $f(x)$. \nWe know $f(x)=\\dfrac{a}{x+2}$. We need to find the value of $a$. To find the value of $a$, we substitute a specific value of $x$. Let\u2019s use $x=0$. We obtain: $f(0)=a/(0+2)=a/2$. For all functions, $f(0)=x_0$ (the $f^{-1}$ of $x_0$ is what we are generally referred to). In our case, $f(0)=a/2$. It can be found on the graph of $y=f(x)$ as the intersection of the line with $x$-axis. 2. Next, we solve for $f^{-1}(3a)$. \nWhen finding the inverse of $f(x)$, we just swap $x$ and $y$ and then solve for $y$: $\\begin{array}{rcccl} x &=& \\dfrac{a}{y+2}\\\\ \\Rightarrow \\qquad x(y+2) &=& a\\\\ \\Rightarrow \\qquad xy + 2x &=& a\\\\ \\Rightarrow \\qquad y & = & a/(x+2) - 2x\\\\ \\Rightarrow \\qquad f^{-1}(x) &=& a/(x+2) - 2x\\\\ \\end{array}$ Now, we evaluate $f^{-1}(3a)$: $f^{-1}(3a) = a/(3a+2) - 2(3a)$. Simplifying, we get $f^{-1}(3a) = \\dfrac{a-6a^2}{3a+2} - 6a$. We can simplify further by putting everything under a single denominator. $\\begin{array}{rcccl} &=& \\dfrac{1}{3a+2}(a-6a^2) - (3a+2)6a\\\\ &=& \\dfrac{a-6a^2}{3a+2} - 18a-12\\\\ &=& \\dfrac{a-6a^2}{3a+2} - 18a-12 \\end{array}$ \n3. Finally, we set $f(0)=a/2=f^{-1}(3a)$. \nWe can simplify the equation slightly before solving: $\\",
        " \nf(x) = \\dfrac{a}{x+2}\nf(0) = \\dfrac{a}{0+2} = \\dfrac{a}{2}\nBecause f^{-1}(y) = \\dfrac{y-2}{y}, we have f^{-1}(3a) = \\dfrac{3a-2}{3a}.\nf^{-1}(3a) = f(0) \\Rightarrow \\dfrac{3a-2}{3a} = \\dfrac{a}{2} \\Rightarrow 6a - 4 = 3a \\Rightarrow 3a = 4 \\Rightarrow a = \\boxed{\\dfrac{4}{3}}.\n### Summary: \n$\\boxed{a=\\dfrac{4}{3}}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\frac{4}{3}.
