Now, we can calculate the average of the 3 numbers $a, b$ and $c$ using $a + \\frac{14}{3} + \\frac{16}{3}$.  Note that we can add up these fractions by combining them in a common denominator: $$\\frac{a}{1} + \\frac{14}{3} + \\frac{16}{3} = \\frac{3a+42}{3}$$  We want to divide by 3 to find the average.  We can take out the 3 denominator to do this: $$\\frac{\\frac{3a+42}{3}}{1} = \\frac{3a+42}{3} \\div 3 = \\frac{3a+42}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{a+14}{3}$$  It is possible to evaluate this expression as a number instead of just keeping it as a fraction if we evaluate $\\frac{a+14}{3}$.

So we know\n$$\\frac{a+2b}{2} = 7 \\qquad \\text{and} \\qquad \\frac{a+2c}{2} = 8.$$We can solve these equations for $a$:\n$$a+2b = 14 \\qquad \\text{and} \\qquad a+2c = 16.$$Now, we can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate the $a$, getting $2c-2b=2$.  But it is easier to write $2c-2b=2$ as $c-b=1$.  Adding this equation to $a+2b=14$ yields $a+c=15$.  So we now have two equations\n$$a+2b = 14 \\qquad \\text{and} \\qquad a+c=15.$$Adding the two equations together, we have $(a+a)+2b+c=29$.  But we also know that $a+2b+c=16$, so we have $2a=29-16$ and $a=6.5$.  So the two other numbers are $6.5+2b$ and $6.5+2c$.  So we know that $\\frac{6.5+2b}{2}=7$ and $\\frac{6.5+2c}{2}=8$.

This problem can be solved more quickly with the simpler formulas (instead of expanding the two equations as above) above. If the average of $a$ and $2b$ is $7$, then we have that $a+2b=14$, and if the average of $a$ and $2c$ is $8$, then we have that $a+2c=16$. Adding the two equations, we obtain $a+2b+a+2c=30$, or equivalently, $2a+2b+2c=30$, and dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get $$a+b+c=15.$$Since the average of the integers $a$, $b$, and $c$ is the sum of the integers divided by 3, we see that the average of the integers $a$, $b$, and $c$ is $15/3=\\boxed{11}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 11. I hope it is correct.### Yes, it is. The average of the integers $a$, $b$, and $c$ is $11$. This problem can be solved more quickly with the simpler formulas (instead of expanding the",
        " \nAverage of 2 numbers\n Average of a and 2b is 7, so a+2b=7*2=14\n Average of a and 2c is 8, so a+2c=8*2=16\n To find the average of a,b and c, add all and divide it by 3\n (a+b+c)/3=(a+2b+2c)/6\n (a+2b+2c)/6 = 14/2+16/2 = 7+8= 15\n So the average is 15/3 = 5.\n### Please read the problem again before attempting a second response:\nWhat is the average of integers $a$, $b$ and $c$ if the average of the two numbers $a$ and $2b$ is 7 and the average of the two numbers $a$ and $2c$ is 8?\nLet\u2019s think step by step.\nNotice that if we knew $a$, then we could find $b$ and $c$ as well. Therefore, we could try to reduce this problem to just $a$.\n$7=\\frac{a+2b}{2} \\rightarrow 14 = a+2b$\n$8=\\frac{a+2c}{2} \\rightarrow 16 = a+2c$\nSubtracting both equations we get\n$2 = 2c-2b$\n$\\rightarrow c-b=1$\nBut this is not a solution to the problem because it\u2019s not giving us a unique value for $a$. So, we need something more.\nLet\u2019s call $a=x$ for some x.\n$14 = x+2b \\rightarrow 2b=14-x$\n$16 = x+2c \\rightarrow 2c=16-x$\nIf $x=a$, then:\n$b=7-x/2$\n$c=8-x/2$\nNow, we know what b and c are in terms of a. Then, the average of a,b and c is given by:\n$\\frac{a+b+c}{3} = \\frac{x+7-x/2+x+8-x/2}{3}$\nSimplifying and solving for x yields:\n$a=\\boxed{6}$\nSo, the average of the three integers is $\\frac{6+7+8}{3} = 21/3 = \\boxed{7}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 7",
        " Let $x$ be the average of $a,b,c$, that is, $x=\\frac{a+b+c}{3}$. The average of $a$ and $2b$ is 7, so\n$\\frac{a+2b}{2}=7$\nSimplifying, we have\n$a+2b=14$.... (1)\nSimilarly, the average of $a$ and $2c$ is 8, so\n$\\frac{a+2c}{2}=8$\nSimplifying, we have\n$a+2c=16$....

(3)\nSubstituting (3) into (2), we get $15=16$, which is a contradiction! Meaningless jungle of equations, it seems.\n### Comments:\nWe use the fact that the average of $a$ and $2c$ is 8, and since $\\frac{a+2c}{2}=8$, simplifying it gives us $a+2c=16$, or statement (2). We also use the fact that the average of $a$ and $2b$ is 7, and because $\\frac{a+2b}{2}=7$, we get $a+2b=14$, or statement (1). When we try to solve the system of equations, it becomes a tangled mess with no solution! It seems that there is no solution for the average of $a$, $b$ and $c$, so we don't have a meaningful answer.",
        " \nWe can denote $s$ as the average of $a$, $b$ and $c$, and we can use the definitions of average to write\n$$s = \\frac{a+b+c}{3}.$$We also know that $\\frac{a+2b}{2}=7$ and $\\frac{a+2c}{2}=8$. We can simplify the expressions on the right-hand sides in both equations, giving us $a+b = 14$ and $a+c=16$. We can use these expressions to find the value of $a$. We have that\n$$a=14-b=16-c,$$or equivalently,\n\\begin{align*}\nb&=14-a\\\\\nc&=16-a.\n\\end{align*}Now, we can use the definition of average of three numbers to write $s$ in terms of $a$:\n$$s=\\frac{a+(14-a)+(16-a)}{3}=\\frac{31-a}{3}.$$\nWe can solve for $a$:\n$$31-a=3s\\Rightarrow\\boxed{a=31-3s}.$$The average of $a$, $b$ and $c$ is the same as the value of $s$. So, we have found $a$ in terms of $s$. In the case when $a=31-3s$, $b=14-a=14-(31-3s)=17-3s$ and $c=16-a=16-(31-3s)=17-3s$. So, we have that\n$$s=\\frac{a+b+c}{3}=\\frac{(31-3s)+(17-3s)+(17-3s)}{3}=\\frac{65-9s}{3}.$$So, we have that\n\\begin{align*}\ns&=\\frac{65-9s}{3}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\quad3s&=65-9s\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\quad 12s&=65\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad s&=\\frac{65}{12}=\\boxed{\\frac{65}{12}}.\n\\end{align*}\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 65/12. I hope it is correct. Let me know if I made any mistake. Thank you for your time.",
        " First, consider that the average of two numbers $a$ and $2b$ is 7. It means $a+2b=14$ Below is represented how we can get it.\nNow, take the average of two numbers $a$ and $2c$ is 8. It means $a+2c=16$ So, we have two equations in terms of $a$, $b$, and $c$.\nWe will take an average of the given average. The average of $a$ and $b$ is 7, when we add them, we get $a+2b=14$, when we divide, we get $\\frac{a+2b}{2}=7$. The average of $a$ and $c$ is 8, when we add them, we get $a+2c=16$, when we divide, we get $\\frac{a+2c}{2}=8$"
