    "solution": "We complete the square for the first equation by adding $(-24/2)^2$ and $(-32/2)^2$ to both sides, which gives \\[\n(x^2-24x +144) +(y^2-32y +256)-16=0,\n\\] which is also equivalent to \\[\n(x-12)^2 +(y-16)^2 =4^2.\n\\] Similarly, the equation for the second circle is \\[\n(x+12)^2 +(y+16)^2 =4^2.\n\\] Hence, the centers of the circles are $(12,16)$ and $(-12,-16)$ respectively. Furthermore, the radii of the circles are equal to $4$.  Now the distance between the points $(12,16)$ and $(-12,-16)$ by the distance formula or similarity of $3-4-5$ triangles is $40$.  Therefore, to find the shortest distance between the two circles, we must subtract from $40$ the distances from the centers to the circles.  Thus, the shortest distance between the circles is $40-4-4 = \\boxed{32}$.",

        " \nThe simplest way is probably to think over the meaning of the problem:\n\u2022 The shortest distance is the distance to which a point on one circle is the closest to the other circle and vice versa. This means we don\u2019t need to find the distance between the two centers (which is a constant) but instead we should find the distance between the two edges of a circle and the other circle (which is a constant) and vice versa.\n\u2022 The circles (both the first one and the second one) are centered at the origin. As the circles are symmetric with respect to the y-axis, we can reason that only the part of the circle with positive y is important.\n\u2022   As we have seen here we can describe the first circle with the equation (x-12)^2+(y-16)^2=256.\n\u2022 The second circle can be described as $(x+12)^2+(y+16)^2=256$. This is a way to describe the second circle;\n\u2022 Now the first circle can be described as a jump from 0 to 256.\nWe can use the coordinates of the points marked with a green dot in the image below to find a distance:\nPrev.png\n\u2022 For example, these are a couple of steps of calculations for a specific point. But these points can be anywhere on the circles. So if we average over a bunch of points on the edges of both circles we will automatically get an answer that answers our question.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\sqrt{\\frac{256}{2}}=16$.\nThis is it. What are you looking for? Only the means or how we even found the center of our circles. We must do a few edge cases and it turns into algebric thing. Once we have both of our slopes (their is no y intercepts) we just find the distance between the desired endpoints. There\u2019s a lot of steps here",

Now, the shortest distance between the two circles (a line) will pass through the center of the two circles.\nLet the equation of this line be y = mx + b, where m is the slope of the line.  The slope of the line from the two centers is $$m = \\frac{16-(-16)}{12-(-12)} = \\frac{1}{1}=1$$\nWe will use the fact that distance of a point on the line from the center of a circle = radius of the circle.  Thus, if we place one of the circles on the line, its radius will be the distance of a point on the line from the center of the second circle.  We can set up coordinates such that the center of the first circle is at (0,0) and the center of the second circle is at (d_1,0).\nUsing the slope, the point on the line from the second circle to the line is (d_1, d_1).  Therefore, the distance of this point from the center of the second circle is $$8^2 = d_1^2 - d_1^2 = 20d_1 - d_1^2$$\n$$0 = d_1^2 - 20d_1 +64$$Now, we can solve this quadratic to get the value of d_1 in terms of radius of the circles. $$d_1 = 8$$The shortest distance between the circles is the distance from the center of the second circle to the line = distance from the center of the second circle to the second circle = 8",

The $\\triangle OPQ$ is a right triangle with $d$ as the hypotenuse. So, using the Pythagorean theorem, we have\n$$(OP)^2 = d^2$$$$\\Rightarrow d = \\sqrt{(OP)^2} = \\sqrt{8^2+8^2}$$\n$$\\Rightarrow d = \\sqrt{2^2\\cdot8^2} = \\boxed{16}$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 16. I hope it is correct.\n[Click to show solution]\nThe circles have radii of $r_1 = R_1 = 8$ and $r_2 = R_2 = 8$ and centers at $(-12, -16)$ and $(12, 16)$.

        " \nFirst, rewrite both circles in the standard form of a circle: $$(x-a)^2+(y-b)^2=r^2,$$where $(a,b)$ is the center of the circle and $r$ is the radius. For the first circle, we have\n$$(x-12)^2+(y-16)^2=128.$$\nAnd for the second circle,\n$$(x+12)^2+(y+16)^2=128.$$\nThus, both circles are centered at $(a,b)=(12,16)$ and have a radius of $r=8$.\nSince the two circles are tangent, their radius of $r=8$ is the distance between the two centers.\n### Therefore, the distance between the two circles is $\\boxed{16}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 16.

        " The circles are given by the following equations: $$x^2-24x+y^2-32y+384=0$$ $$x^2+24x+y^2+32y+384=0$$ Now, we are asked to find the shortest distance between these two circles. First, we have to find the center and the radius of each circle. Here, the radius of each circle is $\\sqrt{\\text{Co}^2(\\text{C}) - \\text{Ci}^2(\\text{C})}$ where $\\text{Co}(\\text{C})$ is the coefficient of the $x^2$ term in the equation and $\\text{Ci}(\\text{C})$ is the sum of the coefficients of the $x$ and $y$ terms. Hence, $\\sqrt{(-24)^2-1 + (-32)^2 - 1} = \\sqrt{576 - 1 + 1024 - 1} = \\sqrt{1664} = 40.$  Now, for the center, it is given by the negative of $(\\text{Co}(\\text{C})/2, \\text{Ci}(\\text{C})/2)$.   Hence,  for the first circle, the center is $(-24/2, -32/2) = (-12, -16)$ and for the second circle, the center is $(24/2, 32/2) = (12, 16)$.   The shortest distance between the circles is the distance between the two centers $-\\sqrt{(12-(-12))^2 + (16-(-16))^2}$ = $\\sqrt{(-12-12)^2 + (-16-16)^2}$ = $\\sqrt{(-24)^2 + (-32)^2}$ = $\\sqrt{576 + 1024}$ = $\\boxed{40}.$\n",
