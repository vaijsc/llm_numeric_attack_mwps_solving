So the midpoint of first segment: (0+2)/2 = 1 and (1+1)/2 = 1 and the midpoint of second segment: (5+6)/2 = 11/2 and (0+2)/2 = 1. So the slope of line containing the midpoint of the segment with endpoints at (0,0) and (2,2) and the midpoint of the segment with endpoints at (5,0) and (6,2) is (1-1)/(11/2-1) = 0/11/2 = 0/11/2 = 0.

Correct solution: The points are (0,0) and (2,2) and (5,0) and (6,2) so we have to calculate the midpoint of these segments. Midpoint is: (y1+y2)/2 and it also the same as x coordinate (x1+x2)/2.

So the midpoint of first segment: (0+2)/2 = 1 and (1+1)/2 = 1 and the midpoint of second segment: (5+6)/2 = 11/2 and (0+2)/2 = 1. So the slope of line containing the midpoint of the segment with endpoints at (0,0) and (2,2) and the midpoint of the segment with endpoints at (5,0) and (6,2) is (1-1",

Thus, we find that the midpoint of the line segment with endpoints at (0,0) and (2,2) is the point $(1,1)$. Similarly, the midpoint of the line segment with endpoints at (5,0) and (6,2) is the point $(\\frac{11}{2},1)$.

The slope of the line containing the points $(1,1)$ and $(5.5,1)$ is 0, since the points are on the same horizontal line.  However, the modified problem asks us to find the slope of the line containing the midpoint of the two midpoints, not the midpoint of the two endpoints.  Therefore, we need to compute the midpoint of the segment with endpoints $(1,1)$ and $(5.5,1)$:$\\left(\\frac{1+5.5}{2},\\frac{1+1}{2}\\right)=(3,1)$\n### ",

I hope it is correct. :D\nHis formula to find the answer, (0+2)/2, (0+2)/2)=(1, 1) just doesn't make sense! It's wrong. It should be ((0+2)/2, (0+2)/2)=(1, 1) as per the formula to find the midpoint. The reason is that when we use a formula, it's like a recipe, you have to follow it step by step, serving by serving. I mean, you have to divide both the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates to find the midpoint is the rule. So we do it there, first ((0+2)/2=(1), then (0+2)/2=(1). The formula says so. This formula to find the midpoint is like a teacher whos always right, always tells the truth and guide you exactly!\nAlso, another mistake the final answer to this equation, m=\\frac{1-1}{(11/2)-1}=\\boxed{0} just doesn't make sense! The slope should be of the line joining the two points. That's just wrong! If we calculate the slope of the line joining (1, 1) and (11/2, 1), we get m=(1-1)/((11/2)-1)=(0)/(11/2-1). So m is able to have any value, any limit, any value! We can't just say the final answer is 0! We have to be more careful and calculate the slopes carefully! That's why wrong answers are bad! 0 is not the answer. That's all. I hope now the answer is right. I hope so. I hope so!

For example, the midpoint of the segment between (0,0) and (2,2) is (1,1) because the distance from (0,0) to (1,1) is the same as the distance from (1,1) to (2,2).

        " Step 1: Find the midpoint of each given line segment. To find the midpoint of a line segment with the endpoints (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2), we calculate its midpoint with the following formula: \\left(\\frac{x_1+x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1+y_2}{2}\\right). We have to calculate the midpoints of two line segments given above.\n    - First, we have the endpoints (0, 0) and (2, 2) and we have to find the midpoint of the line segment with these endpoints. So, we have to use the midpoint formula with the values x_1 = 0, y_1 = 0, x_2 = 2, y_2 = 2. Then, we get \\left(\\frac{0 + 2}{2}, \\frac{0+2}{2}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{2}{2}, \\frac{2}{2}\\right) = (1,1).\n    - Next, we have the endpoints (5, 0) and (6, 2) and we have to find the midpoint of the line segment with these endpoints. So, we have to use the midpoint formula with the values x_1 = 5, y_1 = 0, x_2 = 6, y_2 = 2. Then, we get \\left(\\frac{5+6}{2}, \\frac{0+2}{2}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{11}{2}, \\frac{2}{2}\\right) = (5.5, 1).\nStep 2: Find the slope of the line containing the midpoint of two line segments. There are two ways to solve this step. We can either find the slope between the two midpoints or we can find the slopes of the two line segments individually. Both methods would give us the same answer.\n### Method 1: Find the slope between the two midpoints. To find the slope between the two midpoints (1, 1) and (5.5, 1), we use the slope formula, which is given by s = \\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1} = \\frac{1-1}{5.5-1} = \\frac{0}{4.5} = \\boxed{0}.\n### Method 2"
