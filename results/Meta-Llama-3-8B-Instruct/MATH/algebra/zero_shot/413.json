        " 3\nFrom above sequence, $\\sqrt{12 - \\sqrt{12 - \\sqrt{12 - \\cdots}}} = x$.

Then we get $$x^2 = 12 - \\sqrt{12 - \\sqrt{12 - \\cdots}}.$$ First, we expand $x^2$ as following form $$x^2 = 12 - \\sqrt{12 - x}.$$ Next, we isolate $\\sqrt{12 - x}$. $$x^2 + \\sqrt{12 - x} = 12$$ Replace $\\sqrt{12 - x}$ with y. $$x^2 + y = 12$$ Subtracting $x^2$ on both sides, we get $$y = 12 - x^2$$ Now we have a quadratic equation $$y^2 = (12 - x^2)^2$$ Because we know that $12 - x$ equals to $y$, we can easily get $y^2$ as following form $$y^2 = (12 - x)^2$$ Then, we simplify the equation by multiplying and adding by $x^2$. We will get the same equation in Step 1. $$y^2 = 12^2 - 2 \\times 12 \\times x + x^2 + x^2$$ Subtracting 12^2 on both sides.

Squaring both sides eliminates the square root symbol and then we simplify the resulting quadratic equation. Finally, we factor it and find the solution $x=3$. The key is to recognize that we can square both sides and not disturb the formula for $x$. It is as if we move back and forth between the inside and the outside, effectively eliminating the root.
