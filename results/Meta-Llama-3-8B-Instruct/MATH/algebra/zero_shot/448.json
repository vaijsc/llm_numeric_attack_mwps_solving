        " 5.5\nWe are given two circles. But what do we do? We have to calculate the shortest distance between these circles. What are circles?

It is the distance from the center of one circle to the center of another circle. So if we calculate it, then our answer is already given.\nNow let\u2019s calculate the distance between the two centers. There are two ways to do. First way is to directly calculate. That is when we have circles (x-a)^2+(y-b)^2=r^2 and (x-c)^2+(y-d)^2=s^2. Their centers are (a,b) and (c,d). We have to calculate (a-c)^2+(b-d)^2. Then take the square root of the result. Then get the answer. Second way is to use the method of completing the squares. Completing the squares is the process of the following: (x+h)^2=a^2 and(x-i)^2=b^2. We have to do (x+h+i)^2=(a^2+b^2). In other words, we are going to add and subtract (h+i) from (x+h+i)^2.\nFirst way is better.

We can solve for this distance between the centers of the two circles Additionally, we can break down the distance formula into two components, the horizontal distance and the vertical distance:$$d=\\sqrt{(9-(-6))^2+(5-(-3))^2}$$By expanding out, we have:$$d=\\sqrt{(9+6)^2+(5+3)^2}$$Combine the terms to get:$$d=\\sqrt{15^2+8^2}$$Since we know the Pythagorean theorem, square rooting the sum of the squares is already giving us our desired answer, so we don\u2019t need to write that expression out fully. The Pythagorean theorem formula gives us our answer. $$d=\\sqrt{15^2+8^2}=7$$.\n### Justification: Since we have all your other values in terms of one number, we can square those values, and add them, and since that is the answer we are looking for, that answer will continue to be our answer.
