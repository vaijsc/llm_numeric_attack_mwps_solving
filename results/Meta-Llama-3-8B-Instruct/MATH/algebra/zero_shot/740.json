Using the formula, we get $\\left(\\frac{1+19}{2},\\frac{2+4}{2}\\right)=\\boxed{(10,3)}$.\n**Step 2:**Passing Line\nSo, the line passes through $(10,3)$.\n**Step 3:**Perpendicular Line\nNow, we need to find the perpendicular line passing through $(0,7)$ and $(4,-3)$. The slope of the line is $\\frac{7-(-3)}{0-4}=-\\frac{5}{1}=-5$. Now, we can find the equation of the line in the slope-intercept form: $y+5x=-15$. We can choose a point $P$ on the line, say $P=(2,2)$. Substituting in, we get the system of equations:\n\\begin{align*}\ny+5x&=-15,\\\\\n2+5\\cdot 2&=-15 \\end{align*}\nReducing the system, we get $y=-5x-15$. We can now write the equation in the point-slope form: $(y-y_1)=(-5)(x-x_1)$, where $(x_1,y_1)=(0,7)$. Simplifying gives $y-7=-5x$, or $y=-5x+7$.\n**Step 4:**Perpendicular Line\nNow, we know that the line $l$ is perpendicular to the line $y=-5x+7$. So, we must have that the two slopes are negative reciprocals; that is, $-\\frac{1}{5}$. Thus, our equation for the line $l$ in slope-intercept form is $y-3=\\frac{-1}{5}(x-10)$. Simplifying gives $y=\\frac{-1}{5}x+\\frac{28}{5}$.\n**Step 5:**Find Y-Coordinate\nNow, we have an equation for the line $l$. We can substitute in any value we want for $x$ to find the corresponding value for $y$. Since, according to the problem, the $x$-coordinate is $20$, we find $y$: \\begin{align*}\ny=\\frac{-1}{5}(20",

We plug the known point (10,3) into the equation to solve for $b$. So $3=\\frac{4}{3}(10)+b$. So $3=20/3+b$. Therefore $b=-17/3$. Now we know the slope and the $y$-intercept of the line.

        " \nThe midpoint of $(1,2)$ and $(19,4)$ is at\n$\\left(\\frac{19+1}{2},\\frac{4+2}{2}\\right)=(10,3).$\nWe can notice that $l$ passes through $(10,3)$. We can also see that the slope of the line passing through $(0,7)$ and $(4,-3)$ is\n$\\frac{-3-7}{4-0}=\\frac{-10}{4}=-\\frac{5}{2}.$\nNow, the slope of line $l$, perpendicular to this line, is the opposite reciprocal of the above slope or $\\frac{2}{5}$. The equation of $l$ is\n$y-3=\\frac{2}{5}(x-10).$\nGiven that the point has an $x$-coordinate of 20, we can substitute $x=20$ in the equation above to get\n\\begin{align*}\ny-3&=\\frac{2}{5}(20-10)\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad y&=3+\\frac{2}{5}(10)\\\\\n&=3+4=\\boxed{7}.\n\\end{align*}\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 7. I hope it is correct.  Why is it correct? The line $l$ is perpendicular to the line passing through $(0,7)$ and $(4,-3)$, which means the slope of $l$ is the opposite reciprocal of the slope of this line, which is $\\frac{2}{5}$. Then, line $l$ is\n$y-3=\\frac{2}{5}(x-10),$ and we can confirm that $l$ passes through $(10,3)$ to ensure that the equation is correct.\nGiven that the point has an $x$-coordinate of 20, we can substitute $x=20$ in the equation above to get $y=7$. Therefore, the $y$-coordinate of the point on $l$ whose $x$-coordinate is $20$ is $\\boxed{7}$.\nI hope it is clear.  Please let me know if you need further assistance.  You can ask me anything about this problem.  Thank you for your attention.  I hope you have a wonderful day.#\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 7. I hope it is correct.  Why is it correct? The line"
