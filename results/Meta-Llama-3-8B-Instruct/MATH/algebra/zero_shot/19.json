The ratio of the volume of the two bottles is $12/8=1.5$. So, we multiply the number of calories in the smaller bottle by this value. Multiplying by 1.5 is the same as dividing by 8 and then multiplying by 12. This shows that ratio problems are really multiplication and division by an equivalent ratio (or a multiplicative inverse). Familiarize yourself with this concept for future success!  Having an extra step from the original answer may help you verify the validity of the response if you get stuck.  I also added a general-purpose supplemental tip about ratio problems, given the simplicity of this problem and its robust application.

        " 12/8 x 125 is the formula to apply here. We are essentially asking how many times will 125 be contained in an 8 ounce bottle to equal 12 ounces. 5 (1/8, 2/8, 3/8, 4/8, 5/8) x 125 = 625. So the answer is 625 calories.\n### Nice Solution! Here\u2019s a quicker method. Since 8 ounces is a proportion of 12 ounces, let\u2019s let 125 calories be the x value and write an equation: 125x/125 = 12x/8. Solving for x gives the answer of 625.\n### Correct! Your instructions were perfect and the answers were great. Congratulations on being a great instructor!\n### Thanks so much! I truly enjoy helping students and getting them to see and understand math concepts. That\u2019s what it\u2019s all about!\nSo, I hope that video was helpful for you in understanding how to solve proportional reasoning problems like this one. In particular, it highlighted the importance of being able to write and solve equations to represent proportional relationships. The problem required us to know that the ratio of the ounces was 8:12, which is the same as $\\frac{8}{12}$ or $\\frac{2}{3}$. Then we used this ratio to write the equation $\\frac{125x}{125} = \\frac{12x}{8}$, and solving for x gave us the answer of 625 calories in a 12 ounce bottle.\nI hope that helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification on anything. Thanks for watching!\nAnd as we wrap up, I hope you also take away some useful tips on how to approach these kinds of problems in the future. Remember to take a step back, identify the key elements of the problem, and then use those elements to write an equation that represents the proportional relationship. Then, solve that equation to find the answer.\nThanks again for watching, and I'll see you in the next video!

        " First, find the number of calories in one fluid ounce bottle: we divide the number of calories, 125, by the number of fluid ounces, 8: 125 / 8 = 15.75.\n### Answer: So there are 15.75 calories in one fluid ounce of Vitamin Water. Since there are 12 fluid ounces in a 12 fluid ounce bottle, we multiply the calories in one fluid ounce by 12: 15.75 x 12 = 189.\n### Answer: We need to express our answer in decimal form. In decimal form, 189 is 189.00. So there are 189.00 calories contained in a 12 fluid ounce bottle of Vitamin Water. Report Answer\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 189.00. I hope it is correct.

I hope it is correct. \n### Formula Work\nHow many calories are in a 12 fluid ounce bottle of Vitamin Water?\nThe original bottle has 125 calories. It has 8 fluid ounces. We need to see how many ounces we need in the 12 ounce bottle. Then, multiply.\nWe will divide 125 by 8 to see how many calories in each ounce.\n125 \u00f7 8 = 15.625 calories per fluid ounce.\nWe multiply the 15.625 by 4 to determine how many calories are in 4 ounces.\n15.625 \u00d7 4 = 62.5 calories.\nThe 12 fluid ounce bottle also has 8 fluid ounces. 8 of those ounces will have 125 calories, and the remaining 4 will have 62.5 calories. So, the 12 fluid ounce bottle will have 125 + 62.5 = 187.5 calories.\nIn the 12 fluid ounce bottle of Vitamin Water, there are 187.5 calories.\n### Answer Point\n7.
