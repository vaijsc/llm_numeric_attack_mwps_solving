        " The equation $\\frac{2003}{2004}x + 1 + \\frac{1}{x} = 0$ is equivalent to $\\frac{2003}{2004}x + \\frac{1}{x} = -1$. By changing $x$ to $\\frac{1}{x},$ we obtain $\\frac{2003}{2004}\\cdot \\frac{1}{x} + x = -1$. By adding this equation to the equation above, we obtain $\\frac{2003}{2004}x + \\frac{2003}{2004}\\cdot \\frac{1}{x} + 1 + x + \\frac{1}{x} = 0$. By factorization, this is equivalent to $\\left(\\frac{2003}{2004}x + \\frac{1}{x} + 1\\right) + \\left(x + \\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0,$ which is equivalent to $\\left(\\frac{2003}{2004}x + 1 + \\frac{1}{x}\\right) + \\left(x + \\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0$. By subtracting this equation to $\\frac{2003}{2004}x + 1 + \\frac{1}{x} = 0$, we have $\\left(x + \\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0,$ which is equivalent to $\\frac{x^2 + 1}{x} = 0$. Following the same method, we obtain $x^2 + 1 = 0$, which has no real roots. Thus we must find complex roots. By using the quadratic formula, we have \\\\ \\begin{align*} x &= \\dfrac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1^2-4\\cdot 1 \\cdot 1}}{2\\cdot 1} \\\\ &= \\dfrac{-1 \\pm i}{2} . \\end{align*}We denote the sum of the roots as A. \\\\ \\begin{align*} A &= x_1 + x_2 = \\dfrac{-1 + i}{2} + \\dfrac{-1-i}{2} \\\\ &= \\boxed{-1} \\end{align*}Now we find the sum of the reciprocals. \\begin{align*} \\frac{1}{x_1} + \\frac{1}{x_2} &= \\",

Now, the sum of the reciprocals of the roots of the equation is\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{r} + \\frac{1}{-1} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}.\n\\end{align*}Note that this would be equivalent to the sum of the reciprocals of the roots if $r$ were one of the roots. Since $(r, -1)$ is a solution, $r$ must be a root, and so we have indeed found the sum of the reciprocals of the roots.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 1/2. I hope it is correct.

        " We can manipulate this equation in order to set it into a more familiar form. To do this, let x = a; then $$\\frac{2003}{2004}\\cdot a + 1 + \\frac{1}{a} = 0.$$Moving all terms to one side, we get $$\\frac{2003}{2004}\\cdot a + \\frac{1}{a} = -1.$$Now, we can simplify the left-hand side.$$2003\\cdot \\frac{a}{2004} + \\frac{1}{a} = -1.$$We can now view this as a quadratic equation, since we have a second-degree polynomial $a$ and 2 terms combined.  It is $$a^2 + (-\\frac{2003}{2004})a + 1 = 0.$$\nThis equation can be written $$z^2 + (-\\frac{2003}{2004})z + 1 = 0$$ by letting $z = a$.  This is a quadratic equation.  Since the quadratic formula tells us that this equation has two solutions $a_1$ and $a_2$, using this we could solve this equation as\n$$a = \\frac{-(-\\frac{2003}{2004}) \\pm \\sqrt{(-\\frac{2003}{2004})^2 - 4(1)(1)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{2003 \\pm \\sqrt{2003^2 - 4(1)}}{2004}.$$Let's look at the inside term of the square root.$$2003^2 - 4(1) = 4006009$$ We can evaluate this in our calculator or by hand.\nThe result should be around  $\\approx 4006009$ which will give us the radicand. This will look like $$\\frac{2003 \\pm \\sqrt{4006009}}{2004}.$$ We know that the sum of reciprocals of the two roots $a_1$ and $a_2$ is the sum of their values divided by the denominator. $$\\frac{a_1 + a_2}{1} = \\frac{2003 + \\sqrt{4006009}}{2004} + \\frac{2003 - \\sqrt{4006009}}{2004} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 2003}{2004} = \\frac{2003}{100",
        " \nJulia Thelendra Zha\nIn order to solve this equation, we need to have it rewritten in a standard form: $x + \\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{-2004}{2003}$.  This is an algebraic equation where $x$ satisfies the equation.  It\u2019s a quadratic equation where $x^2 - \\frac{-2004}{2003}x + 1 = 0$.  Now, according to the Quadratic Formula, $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.   Substituting $a = 1$, $b = \\frac{-2004}{2003}$, and $c = 1$, we find that the roots of the equation are:\n\\begin{align*}\nx = \\frac{\\frac{2004}{2003} \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{2004^2}{2003^2}-4\\cdot1\\cdot1}}{2\\cdot1} = \\frac{\\frac{2004}{2003} \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{2004^2-4008}{2003^2}}}{2} = \\frac{\\frac{2004}{2003} \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{2004^2-4008}}{2003}}{2} = \\frac{2004 \\pm \\sqrt{2004^2-4008}}{2 \\cdot 2003}\n\\end{align*}\nTherefore, the sum of the reciprocals of the roots is\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{\\frac{2004 \\pm \\sqrt{2004^2-4008}}{2 \\cdot 2003}} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 2003}{2004 \\pm \\sqrt{2004^2-4008}} = \\frac{4006}{2004 \\pm \\sqrt{2004^2-4008}}.\n\\end{align*}\nAccording to the rules of algebra, we find that $\\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} = \\frac{a+b}{ab}$. Therefore, $\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} = \\frac{x+y}{xy} = \\frac{\\frac{2004 \\pm \\sqrt{2004^2-4008}}{2 \\cdot 200",
