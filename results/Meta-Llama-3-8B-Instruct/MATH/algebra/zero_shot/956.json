        " $\\dfrac{1}{6}$\nAs I have learned and applied in prior problems, when subtracting a fraction, we need to find a common denominator and change each fraction to have this common denominator.

But in the detailed solution provided by me, the correct answer is given as $\\frac{5}{36}$. This means that the original question has an error, and it is not possible to get \"0\" as the answer.\nTherefore, the correct answer in the original question is actually $\\frac{5}{36}$, not \"0\".

        " $\\frac{1}{6}$\nExplanation:\nRecall that when you are multiplying two fractions, the denominators must be the same, so you need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of both denominators, which is $\\boxed{6}$, then let the denominators be the same to the value of LCM: Both $(2\\times3)$ and $(2\\times3)$ are $6$. So, you multiply the numerators and reduce them to the least common denominator: $\\frac{1}{2}\\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$ and $\\frac{1}{3}\\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{9}$ The second one leaves us with the same problem still, we must find the LCM of $(2\\times3)$ which is $\\boxed{6}$, so, let the denominators be the same to the value of LCM: $(2\\times3)$ and $(2\\times3)$ are both $6$ and $\\frac{1}{2}\\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{6}$ So, the product of both is: $\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{9}$ = $\\frac{9+4}{36}$ = $\\boxed{\\frac{13}{36}}$ I hope it helps!",
