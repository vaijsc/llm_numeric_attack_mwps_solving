This is certainly true for $n=1,$ but it is clear that we cannot have $n>1$ since otherwise $nk$ would be greater than $2005,$ and this would imply $n=1.$  Therefore, $n = 1,$ and hence $a = 2004/d + 1.$\nGiven any divisor $m$ of $2004,$ $S_k$ will contain the term $2005$ if we let $k=m,$ and so the problem is to count the number of divisors of $2004.$  The prime factorization of $2004$ is $2004 = 2^3\\cdot251,$ and the number of divisors of a positive integer $n$ with prime factorization $n = p_1^{\\alpha_1}p_2^{\\alpha_2} \\cdots p_s^{\\alpha_s}$ is the product $(\\alpha_1+1)(\\alpha_2+1)\\cdots(\\alpha_s+1).$  In this case, the number of divisors is $(3+1)(1+1) = \\boxed{12}.$\n### References:\nhttps://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/2005_AMC_10A_Problems/Problem_24\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 12. I hope it is correct. Shannon\u2019s proof is the key here. First we can rewrite 2005 as $k(a-1)+a$, where $a-1$ is a multiple of $k$ and $\\lfloor2005/k\\rfloor+1=a$. This implies that $a-1$ divides $2004$. If we use the prime factorization of $2004=2^3 \\cdot 251",
        " First, we note that any sequence of $k+1$ consecutive terms forms an arithmetic sequence with common difference $k$.  The $n^{\\text{th}}$ term of the sequence $S_k$ can be written as $S_k(n) = 1 + (n-1)k$.\n### Now we need to find all $k$ that satisfy $S_k(n) = 2005$, where $n$ is a positive integer.  Since $S_k(n) = 1 + (n-1)k$ and $S_k(n) = 2005$, we get $1 + (n-1)k = 2005$.  Solving for $k$, we get\n$$\\begin{eqnarray}\n&& k = \\frac{2005 - 1}{n - 1} = \\frac{2004}{n - 1}. \n\\end{eqnarray}$$\n### Since $n$ and $k$ are positive integers and $k = \\frac{2004}{n - 1}$, we see that the possible values of $n$ are $2, 3, \\ldots, 2005$.  Thus, the number of values of $k$ that satisfy $S_k(n) = 2005$ is equal to the number of values of $n$.\n### Here the values of $n$ are listed, along with the corresponding values of $k$:\n\\begin{array}{c|c}\nn & k = \\frac{2004}{n - 1} \\\\\n\\hline\n2 & 1002 \\\\\n\\hline\n3 & 668 \\\\\n\\hline\n4 & 501 \\\\\n\\hline\n5 & 400 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\vdots & \\vdots \\\\\n\\hline\n2005 & 1 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n### So there are $\\boxed{2004}$ values of $k$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2004. I hope it is correct.  }\nPlease enter the answer in the box.",
        " Since the distance between each terms is $k$, and the difference between $1$ and $2005$ is $2004$, then it must be $2004/k$ where $k$ is the integer. We denoted $n=2004/k$ where $n$ is the number of terms in $S_k$.\nWe also know that $S_k$ contains $2005$ as its term, then it must be $n$th term of the sequence.\nLet us assume that we know that $a$ is the $n$th term of the sequence, then we have\n\\begin{align*}\na&=1+(n-1)k\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad2005 &=1+(n-1)k\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n-1 &= 2004/k\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad k&=2004/n.\n\\end{align*}The only values of $n$ for which $k$ is integer is $n=1,2,4,8,16,\\ldots$. And only one of these is less or equal than $42$. So $2005$ will be in $S_k$ whenever $1\\le k \\le 41$, so the answer is $41$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 41. I hope it is correct.  The way to solve this is certainly fun! $\\endgroup$ and made sure $\\endgroup$ were present in my solution.\nWe also know that $S_k$ contains $2005$ as its term, then it must be $n$th term of the sequence.\nLet us assume that we know that $a$ is the $n$th term of the sequence, then we have\n\\begin{align*}\na&=1+(n-1)k\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad2005 &=1+(n-1)k\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n-1 &= 2004/k\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad k&=2004/n.\n\\end{align*}The only values of $n$ for which $k$ is integer is $n=1,2,4,8,16,\\ldots$.

        " ####  Final Answer: The final answer is 12. I hope it is correct.  The first term $a_1=1$ and the last term is $2005$. We should find out the last term in terms of $k$. Since $a_1=1$ and the common difference is $k$, the last term can be written as $a_n=a_1+(n-1)k$, where $n$ is the number of terms in the sequence. We know that $a_n=2005$, so we have:\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\hspace{1cm}a_1+(n-1)k=2005\\\\\n&1+(n-1)k=2005\\\\\n&n-1=\\frac{2004}{k}\\\\\n&n=1+\\frac{2004}{k}\n\\end{align*}\nThus, $n$ is not an integer when $k=1,2,3,4,6,8$, but $n$ is an integer when $k=5,7,9,\\ldots$. When $k=5$, $n=\\frac{401}{1}$, so $k=5$ is not possible. However, $n$ can be a large integer when $k\\ge 7$. Therefore, we can find the smallest integer $k$ that makes $n$ an integer. By dividing 2004 by consecutive odd integers starting from 7, we find that $k=11$ is the first integer for which this occurs.\nNow, we can conclude that $n>2004$, because $11\\le k\\le31$, so $12\\le n\\le 63$. Therefore, the number of values of $k$ for which $S_k$ contains $2005$ as a term is $\\boxed{12}$. Final Answer: The final answer is 12. I hope it is correct.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 12.

        " A first step is to figure out what to expect.  We are looking for a number of the form $1, k, k+1, \\ldots, 2005$, where $k$ is positive.  We thus want the $n$th term to be one less than $2005$, which means we want $$k(n-1)+1=2005\\Rightarrow k(n-1)+1-1=2004\\Rightarrow kn=2004.$$ Because we have a factor of $k$ on the left, we would expect that $k\\mid 2004$.   Note that $k$ is positive, so it is of the form $2^aq$, where $q$ is odd.  So we can try various values of $a$ and see which work out.  First, let us pick $a\\ge2$.  Then we have that $k=2^aq$.   Note that $q$ must also divide $2004$, so if $q$ is odd then $q$ must be one of the following numbers: $1,3,4,8,12,16,\\ldots, 2004$.  Clearly the only values of $q$ that are odd are $1,3, 9$, and $1$, $3$, and $9$ are not factors of $2004$, so $a\\ge2$ gives us no solutions.  Next, let us pick $a=1$, which gives us $k=2q$.  Note that $k$ is required to be larger than 1, so $q>1/2$.  We can ignore even values of $q$, since they will be divisible by $2$.  We pick $q=3,5,7,\\ldots,1000$, and check each of the corresponding $k$ to see if they satisfy the equation given in the problem statement.  A little bit of computation gives us that there are exactly $\\boxed{16}$ such $k$, so we are done.  The answer is therefore $16$.\n### Side note: A lot of the computation in the solution just above can be eliminated by recognizing that $2004 = 2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 167$.  Thus we can in fact have $a=2$ and $q=3$, $167$, or a power of $167$, and this gives us $3$ additional solutions.  Therefore, there are",
        " \nLet $a_n$ denote the $n$th term of $S_k$.  Since $a_n = 1 + (n-1)k$, we need to find the value of $n$ such that $1 + (n-1)k = 2005$.  Multiplying both sides by $k$, we have $k(1 + (n-1)k) = k\\cdot 2005$.  Using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence, we know that the sum of the first $n$ terms of $S_k$ is given by $\\frac{n}{2}(1 + (n-1)k)$.  Equating this expression to the value of $2005$, we find the following equation:\n$$\\frac{n}{2}(1 + (n-1)k) = 2005 = 2005.$$Clearly, this equation factors as follows:\n$$\\gcd(n,k)(k(n - 1) + n) = 2k(2005) = 4010k.$$Since $\\gcd(n,k)|n$ and the left-hand side is even, we have that $\\gcd(n,k)\\ge 2$.  Therefore, there are $k(4010/2)-\\boxed{391}$ solutions, since we need to divide out $\\gcd(n,k)$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 391. I hope it is correct. Let me know if I have made any mistake. I will be glad to correct it.   \n",
        "  We know that $S_k$ contains 1 as the first term, so 2005 must be the $n$-th term in the sequence, where $n$ is an integer greater than 1. The $n$-th term in the arithmetic sequence is $f_n = 1 + (n-1)k$.  So we obtain the equation\n\\begin{align*}\n1 + k(n - 1) &= 2005,\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\quad n &= \\frac{2004}{k} + 1.\n\\end{align*}\nSince $n$ must be an integer, it follows that $k$ must divide $2004$.  So if we make a list of all the factors of $2004$, and for each of these factors, we calculate $\\frac{2004}{k}+1$, we will obtain a list of solutions to the problem.  These factors are $1,2,3,4,8,12,24,41,83,167,334$ and $667$.  Out of these, we will only count the values of $k$ for which $\\frac{2004}{k}+1$ is also an integer.  These $k$-values give us the solutions to the problem, which are $1,2,3,4,8,12,24$, and $167$.  Therefore, there are $\\boxed{7}$ such values of $k$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 7.
