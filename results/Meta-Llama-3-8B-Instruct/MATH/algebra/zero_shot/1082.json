Here is an interesting  **ACE(Analysis, Comprehension, Execution) Chart for reference.**   I do my best to describe this chart, but can not guarantee  my  description  will cover all of them because it is very simple to describe the concepts.{ Analysis } - Start the solution by identifying key variables (say, x, y) and equations. See how many functions you have and how to put them in a single expression, such as f(x) or f(y) which helps to visualize. - Look for any constants, such as coefficients in the equations.  How to keep them separated from variables? In this case, you must remember that they are not constants, even though you think that they are. Often, constants help in solving the problem. { Comprehension } - Start to understand the structure of the problem. Are you trying to solve a set of simultaneous equations or a single function?  Can you make sense of it?  Do you see any pattern in the variables? In this case, we have two separate equations ($2^a$ and $a^b$). We have to make sense of this pattern and try to represent them in a single equation.  { Execution } - Now,  use the information gained in the Analysis and Comprehension steps to solve the problem. You can start solving the equations either by plugging in expressions, plugging in values, or other methods. I hope this chart will help you in solving math problems. I use these to help myself and hope it can help you too. Please note these techniques are not just applicable to algebra, but to many areas of mathematics.

        " \nGiven $2^a = 32$ \nand $a^b = 125$\nThe first equation, $2^a = 32$ means $2$ raised to the power of $a$ equals $32$.\nSo, we know that the base $2$ with the power $a$ gives us $32$. Now let\u2019s write this as $2^a = 2^5$.\nThe whole left side was expressed as $2$ raised to the power of $a$. So, we can say that $a = 5$ because both sides have the same power.\nMoving on to the second equation, $a^b = 125$.\nNow we have found that $a = 5$. So, we can replace $a$ with $5$:\n$$5^b = 125$$\nNotice that $5^3 = 125$, so $b = 3$.\nFinally, we are asked to find $b^a$.\nWe have found $b = 3$ and $a = 5$.

        " \n(Note: Here I use rounding to make the explanation easier and stricter numerically. Mathematically we can perform precise analysis, but some minor differences exist.)\n1. Given $2^a = 32$, so $2^5 = 32$ as $32 = 2^5$. Likewise, since $2^1 < 32 <$ $2^6$, we have $5 < a < 6$. Notice it does not say $a = 6$ specifically, so let $a = 5.5$ (around 5).\n2. Given $a^b = 125$ and $a = 5.5$; what does $b$ look like? In particular, what is $b$? We can do this indirectly. Let\u2019s set $a^b = 125$ as an equation:\n$$5.5^b = 125$$Now subtract 1 from both sides to make progress:\n\\begin{align*}\n5.5^b &= 125 \\\\\n(5.5)^b - 1^b &= 125 - 1 \\\\\n5.5^{b-1} \\cdot 5.5 - 1^{b-1} &= 124.\n\\end{align*}\nNotice that the exponent has the form $b-1$, which is transforming from $b$ to $b-1$! We will need this change later. Now we want to isolate $b-1$.\n\\begin{align*}\n5.5^{b-1} \\cdot 5.5 - 1^{b-1} &= 124 \\\\\n5.5^{b-1} &= 124/5.5 + 1^{b-1} \\\\\n5.5^{b-1} &= 22.727^{\\require{enclose}\n        \\enclose{horizontalstrike}{\\ }} + 1^{b-1}\n\\end{align*}\nThis is roughly equal to $22.73$ as the values of $b-1$ are not conceptually clear here. Since $5.5$ is slightly smaller than $23$, this gives us a rough idea for $b-1$ as it\u2019s around $2.6$ to $3$. Thus, we have:\n$$b-1 \\approx 2.6$$, which means that:\n$$b \\approx 3.6$$\n3. Combining the answers: $a = 5.",
        " The value of $2^a$ is 32 which means $a=\\log_{2}32$ which equals 5. Next, it says $a^b$ is 125. And $a=5$, so $5^b$ is 125, which implies $b=\\log_{5}125$ which is 3. And so, $b^a = 3^5 = 243$. So the answer is $\\boxed{243}$. Hope it\u2019s helpful. Thanks for your watch on this video!\n### Target Description: Target Description\nTarget Description\n### ",
