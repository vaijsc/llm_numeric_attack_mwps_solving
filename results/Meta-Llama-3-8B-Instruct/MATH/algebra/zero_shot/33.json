        " The slope of this line is\n$$(y_2-y_1)/(x_2-x_1)=(-14+(-17))/((p+2)-2)=(-31)/(p).$$ This line will also pass through $(p+2,-17)$ and $(13,q)$. Therefore, another way to write this line is\n$$y = (-31)/(p)(x-2)-17.$$ Plugging in $x=p+2$ gives $$-17 = (-31)/(p)((p+2)-2)-17 \\Rightarrow 0 = (-31)(p+3)-(-31)(p)-17(-31) \\Rightarrow 0 = 31p+93+465 \\Rightarrow 31p = -558 \\Rightarrow p=-18.$$\nThen,\n$$q=(-31)/(-18)(13-2)-17=(-31)/(-6)(11)-17=53-17=36.$$ So, $$p+q = -18+36=\\boxed{18.}$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 18.

        " \nFirst, we can figure out the slope of the line by calculating the difference in $y$ by the difference in $x$: $$(p+2)-p = 2, (-17) - (-14) = -3$$ So, the slope is $\\frac{2}{-3}$.

We start by finding the slope of the line, which is $$\\frac{-14-(-5)}{p-2}=\\frac{-9}{p-2}.$$Using this, we can create an equation of the form $y = mx+b$ where $m$ is our slope and $b$ is the $y$-intercept. This is: $$y = \\frac{-9}{p-2}(x-2) = \\frac{-9}{p-2}(x)+9.$$We can plug in our first point, $(2,-5)$, to get $$-5 = \\frac{-9}{p-2}(2)+9 = \\frac{-18+18}{p-2}+9 = 9.$$This does not work, so we must have the right-hand side equal to $-5$. So we get $$-5 = \\frac{-9}{p-2}(2) = -\\frac{18}{p-2}.$$We can multiply each side by $p-2$ and solve for $p$.$$-5(p-2)=18\\implies p=8.$$With the value of $p$, we can calculate the slope again to find that $$\\frac{-9}{p-2}=3.$$Using this value, we can create a new equation for the line $y = 3x+b$.

We now substitute in for $q$ in our equation $9p-18=11q+55$ to get: $$9p-18=11(-20)+55\\Rightarrow9p-18=-165+55\\Rightarrow9p=74\\Rightarrow p=\\frac{74}{9}.$$The sum of $p$ and $q$ is then $\\frac{74}{9}-20=\\boxed{-\\frac{146}{9}=16.2}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -\\frac{146}{9}=16.2.

There are two ways to do this, a) by calculating difference and division. b) by making a table and determining the slope. Let\u2019s use both methods here.\na) To find the slope using difference and division, we need to find the $x$ and $y$ differences for two points on the line and then divide them by the $x$ difference.\nThe first point is $(2,-5)$ and the second point is $(p+2,-17)$. $$x_2 - x_1 = (p+2) - 2 = p , \\quad y_2 - y_1 = -17 - (-5) = -12$$\n$$m = \\frac{-12}{p} = \\frac{3}{p}$$\nNow, we need to find $p$. The point $(p,-14)$ also lies on the line, so we can use it to calculate $p$. $$x_1 - x_2 = p - (p+2) = -2, \\quad y_1 - y_2 = -14 - (-17) = 3$$\n$$m = \\frac{3}{-2}$$\nTo find $p$ we multiply the numerator and denominator by $p$: $$m*p = 3$$\n$$\\frac{3*p}{p} = \\frac{3}{p}$$\nSo, 3 = $\\frac{3}{p}$, solving for $p$ we get $p = 1$.\nb) By making a table and determining the slope:\n$$\\begin{array}{c|c|c}\nx & y & \\Delta{x} & \\Delta{y} \\\\ \\hline\n2 & -5 & & \\\\\np & -14 & p - 2 & -5 - (-14) \\\\\np+2 & -17 & (p+2) - p & -17 - (-14) \\\\\n\\end{array}$$\n$$\\begin{array}{c|c}\n\\Delta{x} & \\Delta{y} \\\\ \\hline\np-2 & 9 \\\\\n(p+2)-p & -3 \\\\\n\\end{array}$$\n$$m = \\frac{9}{p-2} = \\frac{3}{p-1}$$\n$$m*p-1 = 3",

We will get a system of two equations: \\begin{align*}\n-19 &= pm + 3m\\\\\n-14 &= pm - 5 - 2m,\n\\end{align*}\nor \\begin{align*}\n-19 &= pm + 3m\\\\\n7 &= pm,\n\\end{align*}\nor $m = \\frac{7}{p}$ and from the first equation $m = -\\frac{19}{p+3}$. We will get a quadratic equation for $p$: $$-\\frac{19}{p+3} = \\frac{7}{p}\\Rightarrow 7p^2-19p+21 = 0.$$ We can calculate $p$: $$p = \\frac{19\\pm \\sqrt{19^2-8\\cdot 7\\cdot 21}}{14} = 3.3333\\dots$$ as an approximate value, or use the quadratic formula.\nThe slope $m$ is also $m = \\frac{7}{p}$ and $m = -\\frac{19}{p+3}$, the y-intercept of the line is $b=-5-2m$. Now we plug in $m = \\frac{7}{p}$ and $m = -\\frac{19}{p+3}$ into the equation $y = mx + b$. We will obtain a quadratic equation in $b$, for example: $$b = -5 - 2\\cdot\\frac{7}{p} = -\\frac{9}{p} - 5 = -\\frac{p+5}{p}.$$ We can solve this equation in two ways:\n\u2022 First method: we will substitute the expression for $b$ into the equation $y = mx + b$ to obtain a new equation in $x$. After that, we will solve the new equation by hand.\n\u2022 Second method: we will apply $b = -5 - 2\\cdot\\frac{7}{p}$ into the new equation $y = mx + b$ directly.\nThe point $("
