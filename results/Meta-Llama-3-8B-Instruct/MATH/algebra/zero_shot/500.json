So, let\u2019s find first the values of $a$ for which these functions intersect only once.\nWe will solve this problem in a way of to find when these two functions intersect and use the method of calculus for get the values of $a$ for which intersections are single.\nIf $f(x) = g(x)$, then we have\n\\begin{align*}\nx^2+a&=ax\\\\\nx^2-ax+a&=0.\n\\end{align*}\nWe can use the quadratic formula to find the values of $x$ for which these two functions intersect:\n$$x=\\frac{a\\pm\\sqrt{a^2-4a}}{2}.$$ If we want this intersection to be single, we must require that the discriminant $\\Delta=a^2-4a$ is equal to zero. Hence, we have to satisfy $a^2-4a=0$, i.e. $a(a-4)=0$. The solutions to this equation are\n$$a=0,\\quad a=4.$$The sum of these numbers of values of $a$ is\n\\boxed{\\boxed{0+4=4}}.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 4. I hope it is correct.  Let me think over again.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 4. I hope it is correct.  We can check Yes.  The question was asking the sum of all numbers $a$ for which $y=x^2+a$ and $y=ax$ intersect one time.  Any number $a\\neq0$ will intersect the parabola $y=x^2+a$ only once.  The value $a=0$ will intersect this parabola at $(-1,1)$ and $(1,1)$.  Hence, $a=0$ intersects the parabola $y=x^2+a$ twice.  Any number $a$ will intersect the line $y=ax$ at most twice.  If $a=0$, the line $y=ax$ never intersects itself.  Therefore, we have a solution for $a$ if either $a=0$ or $a=4.$  These two cases exhaust all possible values of",
        " A critical point\nIn the above picture, it\u2019s clear that we are solving the Diophantine equation\n$$\nx^2+a=ax.\n$$\nRearranging, we get $ax-x^2-a=0.$ We can then factor this as $(x-a)(x-1)=0$, so $x=a$ or $x=1$. Plugging in our values of $x$ gives $a=a^2$ and $a=a$, which won\u2019t give us any new solutions, since we assumed $a$ to be a variable. Therefore, our only new solution is $x=1$, which means $a=1$.\nNow, we can just choose any other value for $a$, and keep an eye out for some sort of intercept point. Of course, we found an intersection point for $a=1.$\u00a0 That will keep happening, as long as $a=1.$\nSince we\u2019re only requiring a single intersection point, there are no constraints on $a.$\n### Final Answer: The final answer is 1.

        " \nLet $x_0$ be a point of intersection.  Then $x_0^2+a=ax_0$, so $x_0^2(1-a)=a$.  If we let $x_0=p$, then $p^2(1-a)=a$, so $p^2-a^2=(1-a)a$.  We know by the Quadratic Formula that there is exactly one solution to this equation if and only if $\\sqrt{1-a}$ is a constant.  Thus, we get the equation\n$$\\sqrt{1-a}=c,$$for some constant $c$.  Squaring, we get $1-a=c^2$, or $a=1-c^2$.  Plugging $a$ into $ax=p^2$, we get $p^2=c^2$.  Since $c$ is a constant, the solution for $a$ thus is $a=\\boxed{0}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 0. I hope it is correct.  If there's a sample solution for this one, it's reasonable to consider the discriminant $\\sqrt{1-a}$ (it makes sense to analyze this equation since we're asked for global behavior.) Then, an intersection point will exist if it's constant and we can obtain any a value that satisfies $\\sqrt{1-a}=0 \\implies a=1 \\implies x=0,y=0$. And we also get $\\boxed{0}$ however.  wishful   Or, solving above the $ax=p^2$ as a quadratic equation), we also get this value $a$ \\[(x-p)(x+c)=0$ which you could observe at here is equal to an intersection of the graph. Then you will see two equations $$x^2+(a-c)x-(a^2+c^2+ac)=0$$and$$ax=x^2+c^2$$. So then is to see non-trivial case discriminant $\\Delta$ should be zero then: $$\\Delta pierced bottom 4a^2 \\left( a+(a-1) c \\right) +c^2 = 0$$. Decomposing it into a square gives $$(2a-1)^2 \\le 0$$.  If the intervals are only real for two primes of $a=0, a=1$.

        " The graph of $y=x^2+a$ and the graph of $y=ax$ intersect one time if their $x$ intercepts are distinct. The $x$ intercept of the graph of $y=x^2+a$ is $x = -\\sqrt{a}$ and $x = \\sqrt{a}$. The $x$ intercept of the graph of $y=ax$ is $x=0$. Thus, the most we can hope to get a solution set out of this crossword puzzle is two numbers.\nOur answers are two of the $a$ for which the graph of $y=x^2+a$ and the graph of $y=ax$ intersect one time.

        " First we want to find the points of intersection.\nLet $x^2+a=ax$. This can be rearranged as $x^2 - ax + a = 0$. Using the quadratic formula, we can find that $$x = \\frac{a\\pm\\sqrt{a^2-4a}}{2}.$$We require $a \\ne 0$ for this solution to be valid. Therefore $a^2-4a \\ne 0$, which rearranges to $(a-2)^2 > 0$, so $a \\ne 2$. Thus we finally have $$x=\\frac{a\\pm\\sqrt{(a-2)^2}}{2}.$$Now, to have a unique intersection point, the discriminant must be zero, i.e., $a^2 - 4a = 0$. Factoring yields $(a-2)(a-0)=0$, which in turn implies $a=0$ or $a=2$. We are not interested in $a=2$, so our only option is $a=0$. In this case, $x^2$ and $a$ cancel, so the intersection occurs at $x=0$, $y=0$. Substituting these values back into the original equation, we get $a=0$. Thus, the two intersecting functions are $y=x^2$ and $y=0$, i.e., just a line.\n### Final Answer: The final answer is 0. I hope it is correct.

        " Let $a$ be a real number.\nIf $y=x^2+a$ and $y=ax$ intersect at a point, then at that point we have\n$$x^2+a=ax.$$The point is real, so $x^2$ and $ax$ are both non-negative, and hence so is $x^2+x^2a=a(a+1)$.  If $a(a+1)>0$, say $a>0$, then the equation has a unique solution, since there is a unique point with $x$ coordinates in $(0,\\infty)$ where a parabola intersects a line.  If $a(a+1)<0$, say $a$ is negative, there are two preimages of $0$ under the function $y=ax$, since there is a unique point with $x$ coordinates in $(0,\\infty)$ where a parabola intersects a line.  Therefore, given that the two functions intersect, the function $x^2+a$ will have a double root $x$ if $a(a+1)=0$, so either $a=0$ or $a=-1$.  Since $x^2+0=x(0)$ has two solutions, it is okay to have $a=0$.  In this case the two graphs do not actually intersect.  But in this case we have a solution $x=0$.  Therefore, the solution set is $\\boxed{\\{-1,0\\}}$, with a sum of $\\boxed{-1}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -1. I hope it is correct.agner There is another approach to this problem. Let $y=ax$ and let $x^2+a=y$ be solved for $y.$ Then the solutions are $x^2+a=ax.$ This equation is a quadratic in $x,$ and from inspection might seem to have no real solutions. However, it turns out that one or the other variable is equal to zero, specifically $a$ or $x$. So the quadratic becomes $x^2=ax$ or $x^2+a=0$, so $x=\\pm \\sqrt{a}$ or $x=\\pm i \\sqrt{-a}$ (The second solution only applies to $a$ strictly positive). Now, realize that the quadratic that $y=ax$, has a solution when either the zeroes of this quadratic are in solution space of the original equation, or in other words, when there is appropriate unique",
        " Final Answer\nLet $x^2+a=ax$, or $x^2(1-a)=a$, which has only one solution, so solving for $x$ by using the quadratic formula we have: $$x=\\frac{\\pm\\sqrt{a^2-\\frac{a}{1-a}}}{1-a}.$$ To be real, $a^2-\\frac{a}{1-a}\\ge 0$, which is again $a(1-a)(1-a-stop-')(1-a+a-1)$. So $(1-a)^2 a=(1-a)a(1-a)=0$, and going over the different cases we have:\n\u2022 $a(1-a)=0$, so $a=0$ or $a=1$, so these are the two last possible values.\n\u2022 $(1-a)=0$, so $a=1$.\n\u2022 $(1-a)a=0$, so $a=0, 1$.\nCombining the results we have that the answer is $\\boxed{1}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 1.

        " The equation  $x^2+a=ax$ has two solutions:\nTo find when those two solutions only intersect once, we need to find when their difference is equal to zero. Therefore,\n$$x^2+a-ax=0\\Rightarrow x^2(1-a)+a=0.$$ Since $a$ cannot be equal to zero, we can divide everything by $a$, obtaining\n$$x^2(1-a)=a \\Rightarrow x^2=\\frac{a}{1-a}.$$Now, we require that $1-a\\ne 0$.  Otherwise, we will not have a quadratic equation (it will be a linear equation).\nAlso, we require that $x^2$ is positive.  Therefore, $\\frac{a}{1-a}$ must be positive.  Thus, $1-a>0\\Rightarrow a<1$.\nThe quadratic equation can be solved to obtain that $x=\\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{a}{1-a}}$.  For the root to exist, we require that $\\frac{a}{1-a}$ to be positive.\nCombining all the inequalities, we have $a\\in\\left(0,1\\right)$.\nFinally,  $a$ ranges from $0$ to $1$.  The sum of this range is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\frac{1}{2}. I hope it is correct.  It\u2019s a cute and straightforward problem.  It plays on the idea that the function $y=x^2+a$ is a parabola that intersects the line $y=ax$ when $1-a\\ne0$ and when $a>0$.\nWe need the product to be positive.  Therefore, the value of $a$ should be positive.  But then we have another requirement that $1-a$ should also be positive.  This is because the quadratic equation is positive.  Combining these two inequalities, we get $a<1$.  Finally, when $x=\\sqrt{\\frac{a}{1-a}}$, $a$ ranges from $0$ to $1$.  Thus, the sum of all values of $a$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}.$\n### Connection to the Problem: The question is a test of the candidate\u2019s ability to think about relationships between functions and their graphs, to perform a given analysis and manipulation with functions equations, and to develop and apply mathematical concepts and",
        " 0\nSince $y=x^2+a$ only has one intersection with $y=ax$, it implies that $x^2+a=ax$. But $x^2=ax$ implies that $x = 0$ or $x = a$. $x=a$ is a solution as long as $a \\neq 0$, so we have the solutions $a = \\boxed{\\frac{a}{a} = 1}$ and $x = 0$ which implies $a = 0$. The sum of the solutions is $1 + 0 = \\boxed{1}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 1. I hope it is correct.",

So, $x\\neq 1$. This is the same as saying that the coefficients of $x^2$ in each equation are both equal to 1.

        " The parabola $y=x^2+a$ and the line $y=ax$ intersect when $x^2+a=ax$, or $x^2(1-a)=a$, which is a quadratic equation. We note that the two graphs clearly intersect exactly once when this quadratic equation happens, and thus we can find solutions for $a$ directly.",
        " \nFor the two parabolas to intersect one time, each must have exactly one solution to $x^2+a=ax$. Rearranging, we obtain $x^2-a x+a=0$, which we can solve using the quadratic formula: $$x = \\frac{a\\pm\\sqrt{a^2-4\\cdot1\\cdot a}}{2\\cdot1} = \\frac{a\\pm\\sqrt{a(a-4)}}{2}.$$ The only way for there to be exactly one solution is if the expression under the square root is zero: $a(a-4)=0$. This gives us the solutions $a=0$ and $a=4$.\nSince the question asks us to add up all possible values of $a$, we simply add $0$ and $4$ together to get $\\boxed{4}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 4.

        " The graphs intersect one time if and only if it touches once. That is, only if the derivative is equal to 0 at the point where they intersect.

        " By the way, we are not sure if you overhyped the difficulty of this problem to make yourself look smart! This problem is very simple. Do you want us to give you the solution now?\nwait, give us a chance :D Therefore, we already assume that the graph of $y=ax$ is a straight line. An intersection of $y=x^2+a$ and $y=ax$ occurs when $x^2+a=ax$. Rearranging, we obtain $x^2(1-a)=a$. This can only happen when $a=0$ or $x = \\pm\\sqrt{a}$. Since $x^2(1-a)$ must be a real number, we see that $a \\ge 0$. When $a=0$, this means $x=0$ is an intersection point, so the number of intersection points is either 2 or 1. We can check by plotting the graphs of $y=x^2$ and $y=ax$ for $a > 0$ to see that there is only one intersection point when $a>0$. In summary, there are at most 2 intersection points. It's actually $\\boxed{0}$ since there are at most 2 intersection points and the sum of those is $\\le 2$.",
        " \nLet $a$ be the sum of all numbers $a$ for which the graph of $y=x^2+a$ and the graph of $y=ax$ intersect one time. Let $f(x)=x^2+a$ and $g(x)=ax.$  For these graphs to intersect, we need their $x$-coordinates to be the same.  Therefore, we get the following equation:\n$$x^2+a=ax$$\nwhich is equivalent to $x^2(ax-1)=a$, or, $x^2(x-a-1)=a$.  Note that $a$ cannot be equal to 0, since that would imply $a^2=0\\Rightarrow a=0$ which would make the sum $a$ empty.  Furthermore, let $x=y$ since $a$ and $y$ need to be the same.  Hence, we have that $a=y^2(y-1-a)$, or $y^3-y^2=a.$\nNow, we can think of this quadratic as a parabola opening up since the $x$ value is greater than $a$ except for when $x=1$.",
        " The graph of the parabola opens upward. So we need this parabola and the line $y=ax$ to intersect one time, which is the only time when a third equation, $x^2+a=ax$, has one solution. Setting the determinant of the derivative of $x^2+a$ and $ax$ equal to zero, run from left to right, graph and $x^2+a$, and solve for $a$ to get the sum.\nYou can also see PartCashflow carefully coloring part of it.\nSolution  We can solve this problem two ways. Let\u2019s try solving it in the finite fields below. One method is, without loss of generality, if we get $x^2+a=ax$. From $x^2+a=ax$ we simply set $x^2=0$ therefore $x^2=0$. But we can also solve that using inverses and following Vi\u00e8te\u2019s formulas, or by noticing that we don\u2019t have to look for the roots, because if we have $ax^2$, then by dividing $ax^2$ and the $x$ variable, we simply get $x$, and by substituting from this equation we simply get $0$. So we employ this way we obtain $a=0$. Where $x$ and $a$ have $0$ in common.

        " First, we need to find the intersection points between the two graphs. We know that $x^2+a=ax$, so we can simplify this to $x^2-x+a=0$.

        "\nLet $y=x^2+a$ and $y=ax$ intersect at only one point.  Since both curves intersect at only one point and we know that the second intersection is the only intersection given that the slope at that point must be 0, that information would be useful.  Since the linear curve $y=ax$ is shifted up infinitely many times when added a positive number $t$ to $a$, if we have two intersections, say (a,b) and (m,n), we know that when $t$ is sufficiently positive, $y=ax$ and $y=x^2+a+t$ intersect.  Therefore, parts of $y=ax$ and $y=x^2+a+t$ intersect and intersect infinitely often.  Hence, we can discard those answers.  It only makes sense that they only intersect at one point.  To find the $x$-value, we simply set $x^2+a=ax$ and solve for $x$:\n$$x^2 - ax + a = 0$$or$$x=\\frac{a\\pm\\sqrt{a^2-4a}}{2}.$$By notes from the beginning, $a$ must be positive since we do not want many intersections, giving the roots to be$$x=\\frac{a\\pm\\sqrt{a^2-4a}}{2},$$where both roots must give the intersections.
