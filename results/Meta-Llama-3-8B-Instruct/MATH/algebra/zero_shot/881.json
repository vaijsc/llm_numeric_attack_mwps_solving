        "  We are given that the equation x^2-mx+n=0 has roots k and t, and k>t. That means we can factor the equation as (x-k)(x-t)=0. Expanding this gives x^2-(k+t)x+kt=0. Since we know that k+t=m, we have x^2-mx+kt=0. Equating n and kt, we get that n=kt. We also know that k and t are roots of the polynomial, so plugging those in gives k^2-my+n=0 and t^2-my+n=0. Taking these two equations and subtracting them from each other gives (k-t)x-my=0. Comparing coefficients gives us m=k+t. Hence, n=kt=(k+t)t=(k+t)k=m. Since we know that k+t=m is prime, the possibilities are m=2,3,5,7,11,13. The only way m can be 2 and be both k+t and kt is if k=1 and t=1. However, this doesn\u2019t work because the problem states that k>t. Likewise, m can\u2019t be 3, because k+t can\u2019t equal kt. We also can\u2019t have m being 5, 7 or 11 because k+t and kt won\u2019t be the same. This leaves us with m being 13.

        " We have that $x^2 - mx + n = 0$ has two distinct roots, $k$ and $t$, so the discriminant, $m^2 - 4n$, is equal to zero. This gives $m^2 = 4n$, or $m = 2\\sqrt{n}$. Since $m$ and $n$ are both prime numbers, this implies that $n$ is a perfect square (and thus $m$ is an integer)This further implies that $k$ and $t$ are also square roots of $n$, and they have different parity. This lets us quickly rule out $n = 1$. Now, if $n = 4$, then $m = 4$, but this would make the equation $x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0$ have roots $2$ and $2$, not of different parity.\n### Other option: An alternative way to think of this problem is as follows:\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{32}$.

What is the value of $m^n + n^m + k^t + t^k$?\nLet\u2019s think step by step. The equation can be rewritten using the quadratic formula as \\begin{align*}\nx&=\\frac{m\\pm\\sqrt{m^2-4n}}{2}\\\\\n&=\\frac{m\\pm\\sqrt{(m)^2-4(m)(n)}}{2}\\\\\n&=\\frac{m\\pm\\sqrt{(m-2n)^2-4m\\cdot n}}{2}\\\\\n&=\\frac{m\\pm| m - 2n|}{2}.\n\\end{align*}Since $m$ and $n$ are both prime numbers, $2n$ is not $m$, hence, $x=\\frac{m\\pm m}{2}$, that is, $x=m$ is the solution of $x^2 - mx + n = 0$. Then, the equation is $(x-m)^2 = n$, so $n=(x-m)^2$. Thus, $k$ and $t$ are roots of $(x-m)^2=n$. Let $p=\\sqrt{n}$. Then, $x-m=p$ or $x-m=-p$. The first case gives $x=2p+m$ and the second case gives $x=2(-p)+m=-p+m$. This shows that $k=\\max\\{2p+m,-p+m\\}$ and $t=\\min\\{2p+m,-p+m\\}$.\nThe maximum and minimum of $2p+m$ and $-p+m$ are the same if and only if $2p+m=-p+m$, that is, $3p=0$. In that case, $p=0$ which implies that $n$ is not an integer. Hence, the maximum and minimum of $2p+m$ and $-p+m$ are different, that is, $k>0$, which gives $k=2p+m$, $t=-p+m$. Then, we obtain $m^n+n^m+k^t+t^",

By Vieta\u2019s formulas, we have\n\\begin{align*}\nk+t&=m\\\\\nkt&=n\n\\end{align*}We want to minimize $m+n$ and so we want to pick $m$ as small as possible.\nSince $m$ is a prime number greater than 2 and $n$ is a prime number, we know that $n$ must be either $2,3$ or $5$. If $n=2$, then $kt=2$, implying $k=t$. But this is false, so $n$ cannot be $2$.\nIf $n=3$, then $kt=3$ and since the problem says $k>t$, we have $t=1$ and $k=3$ in this case. If $n=5$, then $kt=5$ and since $k>t$, we have $t=1$ and $k=5$.\nBoth of these cases, $k+t=m$, gives\n\\begin{align*}\nk+t=m&\\rightarrow t+3=5\\rightarrow t=2,\\,\\,\\,\\, t+5=5\\rightarrow t=0\n\\end{align*}The second equation is clearly incorrect, so we know that $n=3$, $t=1$ and $k=3$. Therefore, $k^t+t^k=3^1+1^3=4$ and $m^n+n^m=5^3+3^5=312$.\nTherefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{312+4=316}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 316. I hope it is correct.

        " The two positive integer solutions of the equation $x^2 - mx + n = 0$ are $k$ and $t$, where $m$ and $n$ are both prime numbers and $k > t$. What is the value of $m^n + n^m + k^t + t^k$?\nLet\u2019s start by solving the quadratic equation in terms of $x$: $$x^2 - mx + n = 0$$ \nFactoring the quadratic gives:\n$$x^2 - mx + n = (x-k)(x-t)=x^2 - (k+t)x +kt$$ \nEquate the coefficients of $x$ to equate with those in the factored quadratic, we obtain:\n\\begin{align*}\n-m&=-(k+t) \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad m&=k+t\n\\end{align*}\nEquate the constant terms, we obtain:\n$$n=kt$$ \nNote that since $m$ and $n$ are both prime, and $k$ and $t$ are both positive, it follows that $m$ and $n$ are distinct. Also, since $k > t$, it follows that $m-n=(k-t)$ is a positive integer. Therefore, we have $k=t+1$. So $n=kt = t^2+1$.\nFrom this we can obtain the sum:\n$$m^n + n^m + k^t + t^k= m^{t^2+1} + (t^2+1)^m + (t+1)^t + t^{t+1}$$ \nWe now simplify this sum.\nNote that $$m^{t^2+1} + (t^2+1)^m$$ \nis the sum of two consecutive odd powers of $m$. If $m$ is odd, then the sum has no factor of $2$ in its denominator.\nIf $m$ is $2$, then $m=2$, $n=3$, $k=3$, $t=2$. We now evaluate our expression and find:\n$$2^3 + 3^2 + 3^2 + 2^3 = 8 + 9 + 9 + 8 = 34$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 34. I hope it is correct. (Note: For $m = 2$, the given equation becomes $x^2 - 2x +",
        " Let $f(x)=x^2 - mx + n$. Given that $k$ and $t$ are roots of $f(x)$, we know that $f(k)=0$ and $f(t)=0$. Therefore, $$(k-t)^2=(m^2-2kt-n).$$The LHS is a difference of two perfect squares and hence must be a perfect square. The RHS is a perfect square, so $m$ must also be a perfect square.\nGiven that $m$ and $n$ are prime, we need $m = 2$ and $n=3$. The quadratic with roots $k$ and $t$ is $\\boxed{x^2 - 2x+3 = (x-1)(x-3)}$. Thus, $k=3$ and $t=1$. Then $m^n+n^m+k^t+t^k=2^3+3^2+3^1+1^3=\\boxed{28}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 28.

        "#### (explanation of m and n)\nm and n being prime numbers means there are no individual factors other than 1 and themselves. This is because there can only be a fixed factorization to m (m) and n (n). For instance, 2,3,5,7,11 are prime numbers.",
        " I am wondering that the numbers are prime. So $m$ is an odd prime number, and $n$ is an even prime number.\n### ",
        " By the quadratic formula,\n$$x = \\frac{m \\pm \\sqrt{m^2 - 4n}}{2}.$$Since $k > t$, we must have $\\sqrt{m^2 - 4n} = m - k$ and $- \\sqrt{m^2 - 4n} = m - t$, so $m - t = m - k$ and $m = t + k$. Thus, $n = t k$. We are told that $m$ and $n$ are prime. Since $m$ is prime, $m$ is either 2 or 3. Since $n = t k$ is the product of two positive integers $t$ and $k$ and $n$ is prime, $n$ is 2. Since $m$ is prime, $m$ cannot be 2; thus, $m = 3$. Now, we know that $k$ and $t$ are the roots of $x^2 - 3x + 2 = 0$.",
        " \n### Solution: We will start by thinking about the two factors $x-k$ and $x-t$.\n### Step 1: We can rewrite $x^2 - mx + n = (x-k)(x-t) = x^2-(k+t)x+kt$.\n### Then, we can set up the following system of equations:\n\\begin{align}k+t &= m\\\\\nkt &= n\\end{align}\n### From the system of equations, we find that $k+t=2k$ because $m$ is a prime number, so $t=k-2k=-k$.\n### Hence, $kt = kt+k^2$.\n### Therefore, $n=kt+k^2=0+k^2=k^2$.\n### Hence, $k=\\sqrt{n}$. Similarly, we can determine that $t=\\sqrt{n}$.\n### Then, we can find: $m^n+n^m+k^t+t^k=1+1+\\sqrt{n}^{\\sqrt{n}}+\\sqrt{n}^{\\sqrt{n}}=2+\\sqrt{n}^{\\sqrt{n}}+\\sqrt{n}^{\\sqrt{n}}=2+2\\sqrt{n}^{\\sqrt{n}}$\nSo $m^n+n^m+k^t+t^k=\\boxed{2\\sqrt{n}^{\\sqrt{n}}+2}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2\\sqrt{n}^{\\sqrt{n}}+2.

        " \nStep 1: Using Vieta's formulas, we have that $k+t= m$ and $kt=n$. Since $k > t$, we have that $k=t+1$.\nStep 2: Now, we substitute $k=t+1$ into the equation $kt=n$, which gives $(t+1)t=n$. We rearrange the equation to get $t^2+t-n=0$. Since the equation has two integer solutions $k$ and $t$, we again use Vieta's formulas. This time, we have that $k+t=-a$, which gives $m=k+t=-a$. This is equivalent to the equation $t^2+t-n=0$.\nStep 3: We solve the quadratic equation $t^2+t-n=0$ for $t$:\nStep 3.1: We add $n$ to both sides to get $t^2+t=n$.\nStep 3.2: We complete the square:\n$t^2+t = n$\nStep 3.3: Subtract $n/4$ from both sides:\n$t^2 + t - n/4 + n/4 = n$\nStep 3.4: Factor the equation $t^2 + t - n/4 + n/4 = n$:\n$\\left(t+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2-\\frac{1}{16}+n/4=n$\nStep 3.5: Notice that $\\left(t+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2-\\frac{1}{16}+n/4=n$ != 0 since $(t+\\frac{1}{2})^2 \\gt 0$.\nStep 3.6: The equation $(t+\\frac{1}{2})^2-\\frac{1}{16}+n/4=n$ varies the most when $-1 \\lt t+\\frac{1}{2} \\lt 1$, which is called the \"quadratic formula area\". Since $t+\\frac{1}{2} \\lt 1$, we get that $t \\lt \\frac{1}{2}$.\nStep 4: since $t\\lt 1/2$, then $n\\le2^2=4$ by AM-GM.\nStep 5: $n$ can take $2,3,4$ and we can compute the one where $t>0.5$ for each case.
