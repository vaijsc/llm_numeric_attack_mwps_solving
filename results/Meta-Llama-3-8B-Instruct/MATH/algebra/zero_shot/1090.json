And then we can iterate and therefore you can multiplay the equation (1) with 5 and then subtract from the equation (2), which gives the equation $-10z = -34$ \n### Conclusion:\nSo we have found that $z = \\frac{34}{10} = \\frac{17}{5}$. So that means the sum of $x$ and $y$ is subsequently that of $(x) + (y) + (z)$ will be $\\frac{23}{8} + \\frac{34}{5}$ and therefore the solution is equal to $\\boxed{\\frac{59}{5}}$.
