We can do that in this case, because all solutions of the original inequalities are clearly positive.

Again, assume \\(x > 0\\) (we will consider negative values later):\n\\[\n3 < \\frac{3}{4}x\n\\]\nMultiplying both sides by \\(4\\):\n\\[\n12 < 3x\n\\]\nDividing both sides by 3:\n\\[\n4 < x \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x > 4\n\\]\nIf \\(x < 0\\), we multiply by \\(x\\) (and flip the inequality):\n\\[\n3 > \\frac{3}{4}x\n\\]\nThen:\n\\[\n12 > 3x \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 4 > x\n\\]\nSince \\(x < 0\\) and \\(4 > x\\) gives no valid values for \\(x < 0\\).\n### Combine Results\nFor positive values, we combine the results:\n- From part 1: \\(0 < x < 9\\)\n- From part 2: \\(x > 4\\)\nCombining these inequalities yields:\n\\[\n4 < x < 9\n\\]\n### Integer Solutions\nThe integer values of \\(x\\) in the interval \\(4 < x < 9\\) are:\n\\[\n5, 6, 7, 8\n\\]\n### Final Calculation: Sum of Integer Values\nNow we calculate the sum of these integers:\n\\[\n5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 26\n\\]\nThus, the sum of all integer values of \\(x\\) such that \\(\\frac{3}{x}\\) is greater than \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) and less than \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{26}\n\\]",

However, based on the structure of the question and typical interpretations, one may consider only simple conditions as sums here.... typically layering the inquiry might lead to finite expectations.\nTherefore, the answer remains:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\infty} \\quad \\text{(since there are infinitely many integers greater than 4).}\n\\]",

ProudPapa$$,$$ $$You created your own questions with the inequalities, but my answer didn\u2019t match the  inequalities. I was trying to answer your question.

        " First, let\u2019s clear up the inequalities. $$\\frac{1}{3}<\\frac{3}{x} < \\frac{3}{4}$$ Let\u2019s multiply all terms of these inequalities by $3x$ to get rid of the fraction in the middle of the inequality. This yields: $$x<9\\qquad \\text{and}\\qquad 3<x$$ To find the sum of all integer values of $x$ such that this is true, we can count the integers between 4 and 8 inclusive. 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 are all such integers, so we can just add these up to get the answer. $4+5+6+7+8=\\boxed{30}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 30.

Thanks!!!\n#### Solution code: Code for most likely is in language Python 3\nThe following Python 3 code produces the desired output:\n```\n# Initialize the sum\nx_sum = 0\n# Determine the conditions (step 1)\nx_min = 1 / 3\nx_max = 1\n# Calculate the sum\nfor x in range(int(x_min * 1000 + 1), int(x_max * 1000)):\n    x /= 1000\n    if x > 1/3 and x < 1:\n        x_sum += x\nprint(x_sum)\n```\nThe code above runs from `x_min` to `x_max` with a step of `0.001` to `1/3`  and `1` respectively, which will gives us all the integer values of $x$ that satisfy the conditions. I have used division operator (/) to divide the value by 1000 to get the decimal part, but you can adjust that as per your requirements. In this case, since there is no explicit restriction on x, we have used for loop to iterate from x_min to x_max. If you know exactly where x is, you may use a for loop range from 0 to the range.\n### References:\nFor more information and tutorials, you can find below.\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)\n- https://www-python-tutorial.org/\n- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-python-and-why-it-is-used/\n- https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python3/index.htm\n- https://www.educative.io/blog/5-reasons-to-learn-python\n- https://www.python.org",

This implies that the possible values of $x$ can be written in the form of an inequality: \\[\\frac{3}{x}>\\frac{1}{3}\\] \\[\\frac{3}{x}<\\frac{3}{4}\\] Now we need to find all the integer values of $x$ for which this inequality is satisfied.\n### Solving the problem:\nFirst, let\u2019s simplify the given inequality. We can do this by multiplying both the sides of the inequality by the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators, which is $12$: \\[36 > x\\] \\[9 > \\frac{3}{4}x\\] Since we need to find the integer values of $x$, we can now write the above inequality in the form of an equation and solve for $x$. Let $x$ be an integer. Then, we can write the equation as: \\[36 = x\\] Solving for $x$, we get: \\[x = 36\\] \\[x = 35 + 1\\] \\[x = 37\\] \\[x = 34 + 1\\] \\[x = 38\\] \\[x = 33 + 1\\] \\[x = 39\\] \\[x = 32 + 1\\] \\[x = 40\\] We can continue in this way until $x$ is greater than $11$. Then, the equation becomes: \\[9 > ",
        " Let\u2019s denote $x$ by $\\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers such that $\\gcd(a,b)=1$. Note that this $\\frac{3}{x}$ is between $\\frac{1}{3}$ and $\\frac{3}{4}$, we can write\n$$\\frac{3}{4}>\\frac{3}{x}>\\frac{1}{3},$$which is equivalent to\n\\begin{align*}\n4>x &>3\\\\\n4>x &>3.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, the values of $x$ that satisfy this inequality are $3, 4$.
