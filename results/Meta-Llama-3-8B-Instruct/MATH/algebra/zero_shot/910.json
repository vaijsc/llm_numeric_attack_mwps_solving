        " \nThe arithmetic sequence has the form: a_1, a_1+d, a_1+2d, a_1+3d, ... where d is the common difference between each term.\nWe are given that the 7th term (a_7) is 30. So we know:\na_1 + 6d = 30\nWe also know that the 11th term (a_11) is 60. So we know:\na_1 + 10d = 60\nNow, let\u2019s solve this system of equations. Subtracting the first equation from the second one gives:\n4d = 30\nd = 7.5\nNow we know the common difference. Going back to the first equation, we can find a_1:\na_1 + 6(7.5) = 30\na_1 = -30\nSo, the sequence starts with -30.\nNow, we can find the 21st term:\na_21 = a_1 + 20d\na_21 = -30 + 20(7.5)\na_21 = -30 + 150\na_21 = 120\nTherefore, the 21st term is 120. Done!\n### Code (Python):\n```python\n# calculate the 21st term of the arithmetic sequence\nd = 7.5  # common difference\na1 = -30  # first term\na21 = a1 + 20 * d\nprint(a21)  # print the 21st term\n```\nOutput: `120`\n",
        " \nAn arithmetic sequence follows the pattern 'first term + (nth term - first term) * (n \u2212 1)' where n is the sequence number. The sequence begins with the first term, so let's begin by any number we like, even 0. The 2nd term will be that number plus one, the 3rd term will be one more than that, and so on. Continuing along, the 7th term will be 0 + (7-1) = 0 + 6 = 6. Knowning that the 7th term is 30 and the 11th term is 60, we can write 30 equations for each term: LHD_7 + (11-1)*a13 = 60 60 = LHD_7 - 10*a13 To solve this problem, we can figure the a value (common difference) between the 7th and 13th term a is (11th term - 7th term) / (11-7) a = 60 \u2013 30 / (11 \u2013 7) a = 30 / 4 a = 7.5 For the 21st term, we can set up another equation: LHD_21 + (21-1) * a = ? LHD_21 + 20 * 7.5 = ?  Alternatively, let's solve this equation again and use the equation for the sequence to solve for the 21st term. Since the sequence is an arithmetic sequence, each term is ten more than the previous one. 30 = 0 + (7 \u2013 1) * 3 60 = 30 + (11 \u2013 7) * 7.5 21st term = 60 + (21-1) * 7.5 21st term = 60 + 20 * 7.5 21st term = 60 + 150 21st term = 210\n### Final Answer:\nThe 21st term is 210.

        " The 7th term is 30. Let's define the sequence as {a1, a2, a3, ...}. Then, we have the following relationship:\n### Solution: Given that we have an arithmetic sequence, we can write the equation for the sequence as follows:\nNow, we can set two equations using the given terms. First, we set the 7th term (t = 7) to be equal to 30:\nSince they are in an arithmetic sequence, the difference between terms is constant. That constant difference will be the difference between a7 and a11, which is also 30. We can write another equation based on this:\nWe can solve the equations above for d (the difference between terms) and a (the starting term). First, we solve the equation for d:\nNext, we substitute the value of d into one of the equations (Equation 1) to find the value of a:\nNow that we have the value of a, we can write any equation in the sequence to find the term for a specific value of t. We want the 21st term, so we write t = 21 and solve for a21:\nSo the 21st term of this sequence is 210.\nIn conclusion, the final step is to solve for 'd' and 'a' and then calculate the 21st term. The answer is 210.\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions. \ud83e\udd14",

        " Let's let the 1st term of the sequence be a. The difference between any two successive terms is the same, so the 2nd term is a+d, the 3rd term is a+2d, the 4th term is a+3d, and so on. If we start at the 7th term, 30, we can represent it as a+6d. The 11th term is 60, so a+10d = 60. We now have two equations: a+6d = 30 and a+10d = 60. To solve this system of equations, we can subtract the first equation from the second. The result is: 4d = 30. Then, divide both sides by 4 to find the value of d: d = 30/4 = 7.5. We can now find the value of a by substituting d into the equation for the 7th term. 30 = a+6(7.5). The equation can be solved by subtracting 45 from both sides: 30 - 45 = a, which is -15. Therefore, the 1st term is -15, and the 21st term is a+20d = -15+20(7.5) = -15+150 = 135. So, the 21st term of this sequence is 135. Final Answer: The final answer is 135. I hope it is correct.

        " First, let\u2019s write down the given information:\n\u2022 The 7th term is 30.\n\u2022 The 11th term is 60.\nLet\u2019s call the difference between each terms as $d$.\nWe can write the sequence as:\n30, 30 + d, 30 + 2d, 30 + 3d, 30 + 4d, 30 + 5d, 30 + 6d, 30 + 7d, ...  \nNow, we know that the 7th term is 30 + 6d = 30, so we have 6d = -30. so d = -5.\nNow, we know the 11th term is 30 + 10d, which is 30 + 10(-5) = 30 - 50 = 60.\nNow, we are trying to find the 21st term. Well, we could calculate each term by hand, but there's a more elegant way to do this.\nThe 21st term is 30 + 20d, which is 30 + 20(-5) = 30 - 100 = 70. We could also have done this in our head a little faster. Ask the experts: You could have gotten 70 even if you didn\u2019t know the difference was -5. Here, a difference problem is a bit easier, you can check different values to get it. The main challenge is identifying the difference.",
        " Let\u2019s call the first term a and the common difference d. Then, we have a+d = 30 for the 7th term, and a+10d = 60 for the 11th term. Now, subtract the first equation from the second equation, which gives (a+10d) - (a+d) = 60 - 30. Or, we can write d+9d = 30. Simplify this expression by combining like terms, which gives 10d = 30. Divide both sides by 10 to get d = 3.\nSince we know that the 7th term is 30, and the common difference is 3, we can figure out the first term by subtracting 6 times the common difference from the 7th term, which gives a = 30 \u2013 6(3) = 30 \u2013 18 = 12. Now, we can find the 21st term by adding 20 times the common difference to the first term, which gives a+20d = 12 + 20(3) = 12 + 60 = 72. Therefore, the 21st term of this sequence is 72.",
        " invited\nHello! I'd be happy to help you with that.\nFirst, let's find the common difference (d) of the arithmetic sequence.\nThe formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is:\nan = a1 + (n - 1) * d\nwhere a1 is the first term, n is the term number, and d is the common difference.\nWe are given the 7th term (a7 = 30) and the 11th term (a11 = 60). We can write two equations using the above formula:\na7 = a1 + 6 * d\n30 = a1 + 6 * d\na11 = a1 + 10 * d\n60 = a1 + 10 * d\nNow, we can solve these equations for d:\n30 = a1 + 6 * d => 6 * d = 30 - a1 => d = (30 - a1) / 6\n60 = a1 + 10 * d => 10 * d = 60 - a1 => d = (60 - a1) / 10\nEquating the expressions for d, we get:\n(30 - a1) / 6 = (60 - a1) / 10\nCross-multiplying:\n10(30 - a1) = 6(60 - a1)\n300 - 10a1 = 360 - 6a1\n4a1 = 60\na1 = 15\nSo, the first term is 15.

        " \nFirst, we recognize that since we are dealing with an arithmetic sequence, the difference between successive terms is constant; this is called the common difference. Denote the common difference as d. Let the 7th term be 30. Then, the 6th term will be (6-1)d = 5d, or 30 - d. And the 8th term will be (8-1)d = 7d, or 30+d. The difference between the 7th and 6th term is 30-(30-d) = d. The difference between the 8th and 7th term is (30+d)-30 = d. So we have identified d. Now that d is known, we can calculate the 11th term: 11th term = (7+4)d = 30+4d.\nSo, we know that 30+4d = 60, and solving this equation for d gives d = 5. And we know that the 11th term is 60, so the 21st term will be (11+10)d = 5(60) + 10d = 300+10d. Now we know d, so we can calculate 10d: 10d = 10(5) = 50. Therefore, the 21st term is 300+50 = 350.
