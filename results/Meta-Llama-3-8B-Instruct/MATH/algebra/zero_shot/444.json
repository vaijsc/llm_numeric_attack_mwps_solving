You need to find the product of $Q = 11 - 5i$, $E = 11 + 5i$, and $D = 2i$.\nFirst, you should multiply $Q$ and $E$ to get a complex result. You can calculate the multiplication step by step using the properties of complex numbers, specifically the distributive property.\n$$Q\\cdot E = (11 - 5i)(11 + 5i)$$\nNow, multiply the real parts of the two complex numbers: $(11)(11) = 121$.\nThen, multiply the imaginary parts of the two complex numbers: $(-5i)(5i) = 25(-1) = -25$.\nFinally, combine the results of the two multiplications: $121 + (-25) = 96$.\nNow, you have found the real part of the product, $96$. The imaginary part is simply the opposite of the imaginary part of the original numbers multiplied together. So, $96i = 96i$.\nSo, $Q\\cdot E = 96 + 96i$. Now, you can calculate the product of this resulting complex number and $D=2i$.\n$$(96 + 96i)(2i)$$ \n$$(2\\cdot96i)(2i)$$ \n$$192i^2$$ \n$$192(-1)$$ \n$$-192$$\nThe final answer is that $Q\\cdot E\\cdot D = -192$.\nDo you have any further questions or would you like me to explain this in more detail? I'm here to help.\nThis question has been reliably sourced from the internet and uploaded to the Open-source Stack Exchange Network. How can I",

        " #### Understanding the problem\nLet\u2019s first understand what the problem is asking. The problem is asking to find the product $Q \\cdot E \\cdot D$, where $Q$, $E$, and $D$ are complex numbers.",
        " By commutative property of multiplication, we can multiply the three complex numbers in any order; so, $Q\\cdot E \\cdot D = D\\cdot E \\cdot Q$.  We have that $D = 2i$, $E = 11+5i$, and $Q = 11-5i$. Thus, $Q\\cdot E \\cdot D = (11-5i)(11+5i)(2i) = 22i + (110+110i-25i^2)(2i) = 44i+ 220i+220i^2 = 44i+220(-1)= \\boxed{-176+44i}$. \n### Remark: To find the question, we can use the definition of complex multiplication by multiplying each component separately, and then, grouping the two terms together. ### End of Remark.\n### Next ",
        " $D = 2i$ is in standard form in polar coordinate system.  It does not make any sense to do complex multiplication on this variable. I will rewrite this variable in rectangular form. It is written in rectangular form.\nStep 1:  Let\u2019s find out value of D.\n\\begin{align}\nD = 2i\n\\end{align}\nLet\u2019s find out the value of $D$.\nStep 2:  Find out value of $2i$.\n\\begin{align}\n2i &= 0i+2i\\\\\n&= (0+0i) + (2i)\\\\\n&= \\boxed{(2i) + 0i}\\\\\n\\end{align}\nValue of $2i$ $= 0+2i = \\boxed{(0, 2)}$ because it is in rectangular coordinates with real and imaginary parts separately.\nStep 3:  So now value of D is (0, 2).\nLet\u2019s perform complex multiplication $Q\\cdot E \\cdot D$.\n### ",
        " \nWe have $$Q\\cdot E\\cdot D=(11-5i)(11+5i)\\cdot2i.$$Expanding the multiplication in the first factor, we get \\begin{align*}\nQ\\cdot E\\cdot D&=(11^2-5^2i^2)\\cdot2i\\\\\n&=121+25\\cdot(-1)\\cdot2i\\\\\n&=121-50i.\n\\end{align*}\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 121-50i.

Matrix Form Example Solution ### Matrix Form Example   Let\u2019s say we have a problem like the one above. It says find the product of  Q, E and D, where Q is 11 minus 5 times i, E is 11 plus 5 times i, and D is 2 times i.   In matrix form, this is represented as Q times E times D. But don't worry if you don't know much about matrices. We will treat it like a beginning algebra problem. So, let's think step by step.   Q, which is 11 minus 5 times i, we can represent it as 11 minus 5 times the imaginary unit i. And E, which is 11 plus 5 times i, is the same thing, except it's plus 5 times i. And D, which is 2 times i, is just 2 times the imaginary unit i. So, we have this problem of multiplying Q, E and D. To multiply them, we need to multiply the components of Q and E first, then multiply the result by D. That's right, because when we multiply complex numbers, we can think of them as vectors with x, y components.    So, let's multiply the components of Q and E first. Q times E gives us (11 minus 5 times i) times (11 plus 5 times i), which we can simplify as 121 minus 25 times i^2. Now, let's help it out a little bit. When we square i, we get -1. So, we have 121 minus 25 times negative 1",
        " Q\\cdot E\\cdot D\nQ = 11-5i, E = 11+5i",
        " $D$ is imaginary, so when you multiply a complex number with $D$, you multiply the real part with the imaginary part and the imaginary part with the imaginary part. This gives us\n$$(11-5i)(11+5i)*2i=-22(2i)=\\boxed{-44i}$$",
        " \\begin{align*}\nQ&=11-5i\\\\\nE&=11+5i\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\quad Q\\cdot E&=(11-5i)(11+5i)\\\\\n&=11^2-(5i)^2\\\\\n&=121-25i^2.\n\\end{align*} Also, $D = 2i$, and $(-i)^2=1$. Therefore,\n$$Q\\cdot E \\cdot D = (121-25\\cdot 1)\\cdot 2i = \\boxed{-98 i}.$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -98i. I hope it is correct. Please let me know if you need any further assistance.
