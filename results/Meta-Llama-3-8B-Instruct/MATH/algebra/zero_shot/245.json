So $c=9$, so our polynomial looks like $$(x^3-3x^2+11x+15)-(x^3 + (4-9-1)x^2-4(9)x+5(9)-5)=0$$\n### Now we set the polynomial equal to 0 and factor the common terms. $$-7x^2+11x+110=0$$ $$(x^2-2x-5x+110)=0$$\n### Factor by grouping. We know $x-5$ is a factor. And so the factors work out to be $\\boxed{(x-5)(x+2)(7)}$.\nSolution is from http://web2.0calc.com/questions/committee-question-4-algebra\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 9. I hope it is correct. 7,001 is a solution; we can add them together to get $x = 9$.

        " \nFor all $x$ to satisfy the equation, all terms with different powers of $x$ on each side of the equation should be equal.  So, the coefficient of the $x^3$ term must be zero.  Therefore, we have\n\\begin{align*}\n(x^2-4x+3)(x+5) - (x^2+4x-5)(x-c)&=0\\\\\nx^3 + 5x^2 - 4x^2 - 20x + 3x + 15 - (x^3 + 4x^2 - 5x^2 + 16x - 5x + 5c) &= 0\\\\\nx^3+5x^2-4x^2-20x+3x+15-(x^3+4x^2-5x^2+16x-5x+5c)&=0\\\\\n2x^2-13x+10-5c&=0\n\\end{align*}Since this equation is true for all $x$ we want the constant $2x^2-13x+10-5c=0$.  Therefore, we can set the constant terms equal to each other and see that $-5c=10-2=8\\Rightarrow\\boxed{c=-\\frac{8}{5}}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is c=-\\frac{8}{5}. I hope it is correct. The solution I posted is pretty straightforward and simple. If you have any help requests, please let me know.\n### Comment:\nLet's note here that, since we have a quadratic polynomial, we may fix $x$ and evaluate the (constant) polynomial, then, we are going to need one more step: since there are three monomials of the same degree in this polynomial, we must check whether the linear polynomial is a factor or not.  (This is the key step where most of people can make mistakes.)  In other words, we may see the difference here:  we put $x^2-4x+3$ here because we think \"we need an x squared term\" (a standard solution).  We should ask: can we do something to eliminate the x squared term safely on the left side here?\n### Comment:\nIt is interesting but not efficient way.

        " \nObserve that simplification $$(x^2-4x+3)(x+5) - (x^2+4x-5)(x-c)=0$$leads to$$(x^3+5x^2-4x-15)-(x^3+(c-4)x^2+4x-5c)=0.$$After combining the like terms,$$(5x^2+(4-c-4)x-(15-5c))=0.$$Note that it should be true for all values of $x$. In order to have the condition $$(5x^2+(4-c-4)x-(15-5c))=0$$for all $x$, the coefficient of the quadratic term should be zero, which means$$\\boxed{c=1}.$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is c=1. I hope it is correct.  ## Example 6. The coefficient of the linear term should be zero, which means \\begin{align*} 4-c-4&=0\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad c&=\\boxed{1}. \\end{align*}  Suppose we have that $(x - a)(x - b) = 0$ for all $x$. Then we can expand this out to get $x^2 - (a + b)x + ab = 0$. If $(a + b)^2 = 4ab$, then we know that $a = b$ by completing the square on $(a + b)^2 = 4ab$. This gives us the following possible values for $a$ and $b$: \u2022 If $a = b \\neq 0$, then $(x - a)^2 = 0$, which ... Final Answer: The final answer is c=1. I hope it is correct.  ## Example 6.

        " Solution\nWe must find $c$ such that for all $x,$\n\\begin{align*}\n(x^2-4x+3)(x+5) - (x^2+4x-5)(x-c)&=0\\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow\\qquad\\qquad (x^3+5x^2-17x-15) - (x^3+4x^2-5x+5c) &=0\\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow\\qquad\\qquad 5x^2 - 17x -15 - (4x^2-5x+5c) &=0\\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow\\qquad\\qquad x^2 - 11x +5c -15 &=0\\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow\\qquad\\qquad (x-5)(x-(5c-15)) &= 0.\n\\end{align*}  For this to be true for all $x,$ we must have$5c-15=5,$ so $c=\\boxed{4}.$ Final Answer: The final answer is 4.

        " Let\u2019s first simplify the first 3 terms.\nThe given equation is\n$$(x^2-4x+3)(x+5) - (x^2+4x-5)(x-c)=0$$\nSo \\begin{align*}\nx^3+2x^2-13x-15 - x^3+4x^2+4x-5x+5c&=0\\\\\n&\\Rightarrow 2x^2+3x+5-cx-5&=0\\\\\n&\\Rightarrow (2x^2+5)+(3x-cx-5)&=0\\\\\n&\\Rightarrow (2x^2+5)+(x(3-c))&=0\\\\\n&\\Rightarrow 2x^2+x(3-c)+5&=0\n\\end{align*}\n### ",
        " First, expand the first product and the second product: \\begin{align*} (x^2-4x+3)(x+5)- (x^2+4x-5)(x-c)&=x^3-x^2+3x+15x^2-60x+15\\\\ &\\quad-x^3-4x^2+5x+xc^3-c^2x+5c\\\\ &=14x^2-75x+15-cx^3+4x^2-5x+5c \\end{align*} Next, rewrite the equation as a polynomial in $x$: $$-cx^3+(18-c)x^2-(80+5c)x+20=0$$ Since the equation holds for all $x$, this polynomial must have only $x = 0$ as its root. Therefore, the constant term $20$ is $0$, so $$20=0\\Rightarrow c = -4\\quad\\text{or}\\quad c=5.$$ The $x^2$ coefficients must also be zero. This means that $18 \u2013 c = 0$ or $(18-c)+4 = 0$, which gives the same solutions as above, $c = 4, -5$. Therefore, $\\boxed{c=-4}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is c=-4. I hope it is correct.
