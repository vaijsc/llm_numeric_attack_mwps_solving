The vertex form of the equation is $y= a(x-h)^2+k$.\nThe $h$ represents the $x$ position and $k$ is the $y$ position of the vertex of the parabola. We can easily rewrite the equation $y= x^2+ 2x-6$ into $y=x^2+ 2x+1-7= (x+1)^2-7$. Therefore, the vertex is at $(x,y)= (-1,-7)$.\nSo, we know that the distance between $(x_1,y_1)= (-1,-7)$ and $(x_2,y_2)=(4,5)$ is $$d=\\sqrt{(x_1-x_2)^2+(y_1-y_2)^2}=\\sqrt{(-1-4)^2+(-7-5)^2}= \\boxed{5}.$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 5.

Find the vertex.\nTo find the vertex of the equation $y = x^2 + 2x - 6$, we need to find the value of $x$ and $y$. We handle this by using the formula to find the vertex of the equation, which is:\nx-coordinate of vertex = -b / 2a.\n### Step 2. Find the $y$-coordinate of the vertex.\nNow that we have the $x$-coordinate, we can substitute it into the equation $y = x^2 + 2x - 6$ to find the $y$-coordinate of the vertex.\n### Step 3. Convert (4, 5) into rectangular coordinates.\nSince the problem asks to find the distance between the vertex of the graph and the point $(4, 5)$, we need to convert these coordinates to rectangular coordinates. $(4, 5)$ becomes $(4, 5)$.\n### Step 4. Find the distance.\nTo find the distance between the vertex of the graph and the point $(4, 5)$, we use the distance formula, which is:\nDistance = \u221a[(x2 \u2013 x1)\u00b2 + (y2 \u2013 y1)\u00b2]\nSubstituting the values we have, we get:\nDistance = \u221a[(4 + 1)\u00b2 + (5 \u2013 (1)\u00b2)]\n= \u221a[(5)\u00b2 + (4)\u00b2]\n= \u221a[25 + 16]\n= \u221a[41]\n= 6.4",

For this problem we can use a distance formula: $D = \\sqrt{(-1-4)^2+(-7-5)^2} = \\sqrt{5^2+12^2} = \\boxed{13}.$\n### Solution 5:\nThere are many ways to solve this problem, but",
        " First, compare your equation to a standard form $y = ax^2 + bx + c$. In standard form, $a$ is the coefficient of the $x^2$ term (in this case, $a = 1$), $b$ is the coefficient of the $x$ term (in this case, $b = 2$), and $c$ is the constant term (in this case, $c = -6$). Hence, the vertex is $\\left(-\\frac{b}{2a}, c - \\frac{b^2}{4a}\\right) = \\left(-\\frac{2}{2}, -6 - \\frac{2^2}{4}\\right) = (-1, -\\frac{9}{2})$ by the vertex formula.

The distance formula is a commonly used concept in mathematics, and it is crucial in many real-world applications. The step-by-step approach ensures that the solution is accurate and easy to follow.
