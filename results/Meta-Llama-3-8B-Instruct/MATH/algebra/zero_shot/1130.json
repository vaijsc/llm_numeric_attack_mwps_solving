        "Let \\( x = 0.72\\overline{6} \\). This means that \\( x \\) is equal to the decimal \\( 0.7266666\\ldots \\), with the digit 6 repeating indefinitely.\nTo express this decimal as a fraction, we'll first separate the non-repeating and repeating parts:\n- The non-repeating part is \\( 0.72 \\).\n- The repeating part is \\( 0.0066666\\ldots \\).\nNext, we will express both parts as fractions.\n1. **Convert the non-repeating part**:\n   \\[\n   0.72 = \\frac{72}{100} = \\frac{18}{25}\n   \\]\n2. **Convert the repeating part**:\n   Let \\( y = 0.0066666\\ldots \\). To eliminate the repeating part, we can multiply both sides by 10:\n   \\[\n   10y = 0.0666666\\ldots\n   \\]\n   Now we also express \\( y \\):\n   \\[\n   y = 0.0066666\\ldots\n   \\]\n   Subtract these two equations:\n   \\[\n   10y - y = 0.0666666\\ldots - 0.0066666\\ldots\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   9y = 0.06\n   \\]\n   Therefore,\n   \\[\n   y = \\frac{0.06}{9}\n   \\]\n   Converting \\( 0.06 \\) into a fraction gives us:\n   \\[\n   0.06 = \\frac{6}{100} = \\frac{3}{50}\n   \\]\n   So,\n   \\[\n   y = \\frac{3/50}{9} = \\frac{3}{50 \\times 9} = \\frac{3}{450} = \\frac{1}{150}\n   \\]\n3. **Combine both parts**:\n   We have:\n   \\[\n   x = 0.72 + 0.0066666\\ldots = \\frac{18}{25} + \\frac{1}{150}\n   \\]\n   To sum these fractions, we need a common denominator.

        " The repeating part of the decimal is $0.6$, and it\u2019s $6$ in total. Then we convert it into fraction by useing the factored form for terminating decimals:\n$0.72\\overline{6} = 0.72 + 0.006 + 0.0006 + \\cdots$\n$0.72\\overline{6} = 0.72 + \\frac{6}{1000} + \\frac{6}{100000} + \\cdots$\n$0.72\\overline{6} = 0.72 + \\frac{6}{10^3} + \\frac{6}{10^5} + \\cdots$\n$0.72\\overline{6} = \\frac{72}{100} + \\frac{72}{10^4} + \\frac{72}{10^6} + \\cdots$\n$0.72\\overline{6} = \\frac{72}{100} + \\frac{72}{10^4}\\left(\\frac{1}{10}+\\frac{1}{10^2}+\\frac{1}{10^3}+\\cdots\\right)$\n$0.72\\overline{6} = \\frac{72}{100} + \\frac{72}{10^4}\\left(\\frac{1/10}{1-1/10}\\right)$\n$0.72\\overline{6} = \\frac{72}{100} + \\frac{72}{9000}$\n$0.72\\overline{6} = \\frac{72}{100} + \\frac{8}{100}$\n$0.72\\overline{6} = \\boxed{\\frac{80}{100}} = \\boxed{\\frac{4}{5}}$\nThus, the fraction is $4/5$.\n### KEY POINT\nThis is a terminating decimal because it\u2019s a repeating decimal and the repeating part can be written as a simple fraction:\n$$\\frac{6}{10^3} + \\frac{6}{10^5} + \\frac{6}{10^7} + \\cdots = \\frac{\\frac{6}{10^3}}{1 - \\frac{1}{10^2}} = \\frac{6}{10^3}\\left(\\frac{100}{99}\\right) = \\frac{8}{100} = \\frac{4}{",
