        "  \nWe are given that $y+6$ and $12$ are two consecutive terms of an arithmetic sequence.\nWhat is the difference of their terms?\nThis difference must be the same as the difference between any other two consecutive terms in this sequence. Since we are also given another term of this sequence, which is $y$, we can say that the difference between the terms of the sequence is $12-(y+6)$. So,\n$$y+6-12=y+6-12-6,$$or, without simplifying too much, $$-6 = -12-6.$$Now we can use the second term of the sequence, $12$, and use it to find $y$.\nBefore $12$, $y+6$ was there. So, $$y + 6-12 = -6,$$or, $$y + 6 - 12 = y - 6,$$or, $$-6 = y - 6,$$or, $$0 = y.$$\nThe answer is $0$.\nIf you want, I can explain this in a slightly more concise way.",

        " The sequence is arithmetic:\nAn arithmetic sequence is a sequence of terms in which each consecutive term differs by a fixed constant. In this sequence, we are given the differences between each term. We are told that\n$$(y+6)-12=y-6,$$so this fixed difference is 6. To simplify things, let\u2019s start by replacing the given terms with variables. Let $x$ denote the first term, and then by the definition of the sequence, the next two terms are $x+6$ and $x+12$. Now, notice that our given information is that\n$$x+12-x=6.$$This simplifies to $x=6$, so the terms of the sequence are 6, 12, and $y$. Now, we want to find $y$. Let\u2019s set up an equation for the last term:\n$$x+6=y.$$Substituting $6$ for $x$ gives\n$$6+6=y,$$so $y=\\boxed{12}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 12. I hope it is correct.",

        " Since the given sequence is an arithmetic sequence, we can regroup to form three groups of two terms each.\nThe difference between the terms of the same group is the same, which will be denoted by d.

To find $y$, we subtract $6$ from $12$ and then assign it to $y$, as $y = 12 - 6 = \\boxed{6}.$ #### More info: Arithmetic sequences are an important topic in mathematics. Arithmetic sequences are sequences of numbers where each term is obtained by adding a constant term called common difference. For more information about arithmetic sequences, you can look here: Arithmetic Sequence The formula for the $n$th term of an arithmetic sequence is $a_n = a_1 + (n \u2013 1)d$, where $a_1$ is the first term, $d$ is the common difference, and $n$ is the term number. #### Tags: algebra sequences arithmetic-arithmetic-sequence-arithmetic-sequence-values",
