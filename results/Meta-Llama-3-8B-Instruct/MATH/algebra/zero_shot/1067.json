Last problem, we do a classic trick, which is to rewrite the expression as $99^2+100=10000-1=9901$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 9901. I hope it is correct. The problem asks you to compute $(99)^2+99+1$ in your head. It might be tempting to calculate it methodically, which would take several seconds and not be impressive. Here\u2019s a trickier and more intellectually satisfying way: $99^2+99+1=(100-1)^2+100-1=10000-2\\cdot 100+2=10000-199+2=9900+2=\\boxed{9901}$. The whole process took me about 1 second, and your awed colleagues are sure to be impressed.\nNote that $(99)^2$ is very close to $10000$ (in fact, it is $9801$). In general, $(x+1)^2=x^2+2x+1$, so $99^2=(100-1)^2=10000-2\\cdot 100+2=10000-198+2=10000-19000+2=\\boxed{9900}$. To calculate $(100-1)^2$ is very easy for most people. So, the key is to rewrite the problem in this form and make the most of it.\nTo make things even more interesting, you could divide both sides by $2$ and store this technique for an even more impressive future head computation: $$99^2+99+1=\\frac{(100-1)^2-1}{2}=\\frac{10000-2\\cdot 100+2-1}{2}=\\boxed{9900.5}.$$ This method can be easily generalized to more complex head calculations.

By now we are all looking forward to a relaxing walk on the beach.\nSo how will we use this?\nTo show that $100^2 = 10000$.\nExplanation:\nWe notice that $100 = 10^2 + 10^1 + 10^0$, and by the combinatorial identity,\n$(x+y+z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2xy + 2xz + 2yz$ with $x=y=z=10$.\nLet $A = 10^2 = 100, B = 10^1 = 10, C = 10^0 = 1.$  It is clear that $A$ is positive, $B$ is negative.\n$$(A+B+C)^2 = A^2 + B^2 + C^2 + 2AB + 2AC + 2BC = (10)^2 + (10)^2 + 1^2 + 2(10)(10) + 2(10)(1) + 2(1)(10)$$\n$$=100 + 100 + 1 + 200 + 20 + 20 = 1000 + 100 + 20 + 20 + 1 = 10000$$\nBy the combinatorial identity, $(x+y+z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2xy + 2xz + 2yz, \\text{ and let }x=y=z=10.$  Let $A = 10^2 = 100, B = 10^1 = 10, C = 10^0 = 1.$.\nWe conclude that $10000 = (100)^2 = 10^2 + 10^1 + 10^0$.\nWe just took the time (many minutes spent on journey). It can be performed differently, happily or woefully!\nFor more fun and different ways,  you may easily invent 15-20 exceedingly creative ways.
