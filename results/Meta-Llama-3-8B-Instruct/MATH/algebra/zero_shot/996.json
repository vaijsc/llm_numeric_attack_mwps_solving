Re-arranging and applying Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick, it follows that $$xy - 7x - 7y + 49 = (x - 7)(y - 7) = 49.$$ Since $x$ and $y$ are positive integers, then $x-7$ is a positive integer factor of $49$. These factors are $1,7,49$, so $x = 8,14,56$, and their sum is $8 + 14 + 56 = \\boxed{78}$.",

        " \nThe best way to approach this problem is to get rid of the fractions.  We obtain $$7(x+y)=xy$$Dividing both sides by $xy$, we have $$\\frac7{xy}=1+\\frac1y$$Dividing both sides by $\\frac1y$, we have $$\\frac7{x}=\\frac{y+1}y$$Cross-multiplying, we obtain $$7y=x(y+1)$$After expanding, we get $$7y=xy+x$$Subtracting $xy$ from both sides, we have $$7y-xy=x$$Factoring, we get $$x(7-y)=7y$$Since $x$ and $y$ are positive integers, we must have that either $7-y$ or $x$ is equal to $1$.  If $7-y=1$, then $y=6$.  If $x=1$, then $y=\\frac{7}{7-y}=\\frac7{6}=1+\\frac16$.  Neither of these solutions fits the given conditions of the problem.  Therefore, the solution to this problem is $x=7-y$ and $y=1$.  Plugging these two values into $x(7-y)=7y$, we have $$7=\\boxed{7}$$Finally, we have that the sum of all possible positive integer solutions is $\\boxed7$.\n### Detail Explanation:\nFirst, we get rid of the fractions to obtain $$7(x+y)=xy$$Dividing both sides by $xy$, we have $$\\frac7{xy}=1+\\frac1y$$Dividing both sides by $\\frac1y$, we have $$\\frac7{x}=\\frac{y+1}y$$Cross-multiplying, we obtain $$7y=x(y+1)$$After expanding, we get $$7y=xy+x$$Subtracting $xy$ from both sides, we have $$7y-xy=x$$Factoring, we get $$x(7-y)=7y$$Since $x$ and $y$ are positive integers, we must have that either $7-y$ or $x$ is equal to $1$.

        " We are told that \\frac1x+\\frac1y = \\frac17, so we should first manipulate it into a common denominator, in this case, 7xy. Then, we can move all the terms to the left side and change them to the form x+ y= constant. So, $$\\begin{array}{lll}\\dfrac{7}{xy} & = & \\dfrac17 \\\\ \\dfrac{7}{6}&=&\\dfrac1xy \\end{array}$$ We now have a standard equation. The solutions to x+y = \\dfrac{7}{6} can be obtained by pairing each integer value of y from 1 to 6 with each integer value of x. Note that \\frac{7}{6} is only slightly more than 2, so we can pair up (1,5), (2,4), and (3,3), giving three sets of solutions. \\begin{align*}\ny &= 1,\\ x = 5\\\\\ny &= 2,\\ x = 4\\\\\ny &= 3,\\ x = 3.\n\\end{align*}\nIf we simply add up the values for x, we will get 5 + 4 + 3 =  12.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 12.

        " =126\nLet $\\frac 1x + \\frac 1y = \\frac 17$.  Multiply both sides by $7xy$ to get $7x + 7y = xy$, or $7x + 7y -xy = 0$.  Let $a = xy$ and $b=7x + 7y$.  So the equation becomes $a - b = 0$.\nBy inspection, we find that $a = b = 49$ is a solution, since $xy=7x+7y=49$.  Since $a$ is the product of the solution and $b$ is their sum, we have that $x$ must be a factor of $49$ and $y$ must be the remaining factor of $49$.  Since we are told that $x$ and $y$ are positive integers and $x\\ge y$, we need to consider factors of $49$ from $1$ to $49$.  These are $1,7,49$ and, since we require $x\\ge 7$ for $y=7$, we need to exclude factors of $49$ from $1$ to $6$.  This reduces to the possibilities $x=1,y=49$ and $x=7,y=7$.

Since $w$ is positive, $w=\\sqrt{14}$.\nHowever, the square root of an integer has to be an integer for the solution to hold, so $w=\\sqrt{14}=2\\sqrt7$. Finally, we find that $u=7w+7=7(2\\sqrt7)+7=7\\cdot\\sqrt7+7=7\\sqrt7+7$, so $x=\\frac1u=\\frac1{7\\sqrt7+7}$.\nSince the denominator represents a square root, we can find the least common multiple of 1 and $7\\sqrt7+7$ to get $\\frac1x$ with an integer. However, the LCM is $7\\sqrt7+7$, which is a disgusting huge number. Then, we cannot let $x$ be the sum",
        "  I know how to solve for y in terms of x: \\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} = \\frac{1}{7}, \\frac{1}{y} = \\frac{1}{7} - \\frac{1}{x} \\implies y = \\frac{x}{7 - x}.\nNow we need to eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by $7x$: $$7x \\cdot y = 7x \\cdot \\frac{x}{7 - x}.$$Expanding and rearranging, we have $$7xy = x^2, \\implies y = \\frac{x^2}{7x} = \\frac{x}{7}.$$That yields the following system of equations: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{x/7} &= \\frac{1}{7}, \\\\ \\frac{x}{x} + \\frac{7}{x} &= 7.\n\\end{align*}Solving the second equation for $7$, we get \\begin{align*}\n7 &= \\frac{x}{x} + \\frac{7}{x} = \\frac{x + 7}{x}, \\implies 7x = x + 7, \\\\ 6x &= 7, \\implies \\boxed{x = \\frac{7}{6}}, \\end{align*}which implies that $y = 1$. In particular, we can\u2019t have any other positive integer values for $x$ because $\\frac{x}{7}$ must also be a positive integer, making $x$ a multiple of $7$, which isn\u2019t true.\n### Final Answer: The final answer is 7/6.

        "Let $u=\\frac1x$ and $v=\\frac1y$. So the given equation is $u+v=\\frac17$. As $u$ and $v$ are the reciprocals of $x$ and $y$, respectively, they are positive integers, and $x$ and $y$ are positive integers too. Now, the solutions $u$ and $v$ would satisfy $7(u+v)=1$. This is a Diophantine equation involving seven integers. If $u$ is not equal to $v$, then there is no integer solution, as $u+v+\\frac{u-v}{u-v}=1$ does not give any integer solution. By chance, if $u=v=\\frac17$, then we can solve it by assuming $u-v=\\frac16$, so $2u=\\frac13$, which gives $u=\\frac1{6}$ and $v=\\frac1{12}$. Therefore, $x=6$ and $y=12$, giving us the first solution. So, the total sum of the $x$-coordinates would be $6+6+12=\\boxed{24}$.",
        " Start with the fraction equation.\n$$\\frac1x+\\frac1y=\\frac17$$ Multiply both sides by $xy$ to eliminate the fractions.\n$$y+x=7xy$$ Keep in mind that we are trying to find the sum of the $x$-coordinates.",

        " Let\u2019s start with this equation:\n$$\\frac1x+\\frac1y=\\frac17$$To solve for $(x,y)$, we want to get rid of the fractions.  Let\u2019s multiply both sides by $7xy$ to get\n\\begin{align*}\n7xy &=x+7y \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 7xy-x &=7y \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 7xy-x-7y&=0\n\\end{align*}\nThis equation is clearly a linear equation in two variables $xy$ and $-y$.  To make it a linear equation in two variables $x$ and $y$, we want to get rid of both $xy$ and $-y$.  We can do this by adding $y$ to both sides of the equation and subtracting $x$ from both sides to get\n$$7y-xy-x=0$$ Adding $xy$ to both sides yields\n$$7y-x=xy$$ Now we have an equation with the variable $y$ on the right-hand side, but we want to isolate $y$.  We can do this by subtracting $xy$ from both sides:\n$$7y-xy-xy=x$$Combining the $xy$ terms on the left-hand side gives $$7y-2xy=x$$Now we have an equation that can be solved for $y$.  Subtracting $x$ from both sides gives $$7y-2xy-x=0$$ Adding $x$ to both sides gives $$7y-2xy=0$$Dividing both sides by $2$ yields $$\\frac{7y}{2}-xy=0$$Finally, adding $xy$ to both sides and factoring gives $$\\frac{7y}{2}=xy\\Rightarrow\\frac{y}{2}=x$$Now we have a solution for $y$ in terms of $x$, which we can write as $y=2x$.  Since we can use a variable expression in this way, the solution $y=2x$ represents all ordered pairs $(x,y)$ that satisfy the equation. Notice that we have actually solved for $y$ in terms of $x$, not for $x$ or $y$ separately.  Also, notice that when either $x$ or $y$ is $0$, the equation does not make sense: we cannot divide by $x$ or $y$.  This makes sense because we want the solutions to represent"
