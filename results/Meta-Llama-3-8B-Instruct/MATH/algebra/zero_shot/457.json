To find the vertex, apply the instructions:\n\\begin{align*}\nx &= -(-b/(2a))\\\\\n&= (2b)/(2a)\\\\\n&= b/a\n\\end{align*}But $x$ is also a root; if $k=0$, then the $x$-values are $-2$ and $8$. It means that $b/a=-2$ or $8$, and since only $-2$ corresponds to the least possible value, we have $k=k(-(2))(8-8)=\\boxed{-4}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -4. I hope it is correct.",

        " We want $x$ such that $k$ is least, so we want a value for $x$ that minimizes $(6x+12)(x-8)$. The quadratic equation $(6x+12)(x-8)$ can be written as $6x^2-40x-48$. For a positive quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c$, the vertex of the parabola defined by the quadratic is at $x=-b/2a$.

        " First, we will start by expanding $k = (6x + 12)(x - 8)$, which will give us $k = 6x^2 - 48x + 96$, so our equation looks like $k = 6x^2 - 48x + 96$. We will now rewrite this equation in the quadratic form $k = ax^2 + bx + c$, by comparing coefficients. Since $a = 6$, $b = -48$, and $c = 96$, the equation becomes $k = 6x^2 - 48x + 96 = 6x^2 - 48x + 96$. Now, by applying the quadratic conditions, we can see that the least possible value of $k$ occurs when $x = -b/(2a)$. We will now proceed to find $x = -b/(2a)$ by plugging in $b = -48$ and $a = 6$ into this equation, which will give us $x = (-48)/(2*6)$. After simplifying the fraction, we get $x = -4$. After substituting this value of $x$ into $k = 6x^2 - 48x + 96$, we can find the least possible value of $k$. We will do this by plugging in $x = -4$ into $k = 6x^2 - 48x + 96$, which will give us $k = 6(-4)^2 - 48(-4) + 96 = 96 + 192 + 96 = 384$.
