        " \nThe first term is 2222. Let\u2019s figure out the following terms.\n* Second term: 2222 + 1010 = 3232\n* Third term: 3232 + 1010 = 4242\n* Fourth term: 4242 + 1010 = 5252\n* Fifth term: 5252 + 1010 = 6262\n* Sixth term: 6262 + 1010 = 7272\n* Seventh term: 7272 + 1010 = 8282\nSo, the sum of the sixth and seventh terms is 7272 + 8282 = 15554.\n#### So the sum of the sixth and seventh terms is 15554.### Start at 2222. Each term is three 1\u2019s and two 2\u2019s, except the first term.\n### Sum of nth term = 2222 + (n-1)*1010 = 2222 + 1010n \u2013 1010 = 1010n + 2222\nLet\u2019s calculate n = 6 and n = 7.\nFor n = 6:\n1010(6) + 2222 = 6062 + 2222 = 8284\nFor n = 7:\n1010(7) + 2222 = 7070 + 2222 = 9292\nThe sum of the 6th and 7th term is 8284 + 9292 = 17576.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 17576. I hope it is correct.### The sequence is arithmetic with a common difference of 1010 and starting value of 2222.\n### Let\u2019s calculate the sixth and seventh terms:\nn = 6 -> 1010(6) + 2222 = 6062 + 2222 = 8284\nn = 7 -> 1010(7) + 2222 = 7070 + 2222 = 9292\nThe sum of the 6th and 7th terms is 8284 + 9292 = 17576.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 17576. I hope it is correct.### We can calculate the sequence by adding 1010 to the previous term, and we can get to either the 6th or 7th term separately and add them together.\nThe 6th term:\n2222 + 3(1010) = 2222",

        " \nThe start of the sequence is 2222. Then we add 1010 to get 3232. Adding 1010 again gives 4242, then 5252, then 6262, then 7272. Now we can find the total of the sixth and seventh terms. \nThe sixth term is 6262 and the seventh term is 7272, so the total of both is $$6262+7272=13534.$$ \n### Answer: 13534",

        " We are given that each term is the previous term plus 1010. The first term is 2222, and the second term is 1010 plus 2222, or 3232. The third term is 3232 plus 1010, or 4242. The fourth term is 4242 plus 1010, or 5252. The fifth term is 5252 plus 1010, or 6262. The sixth term is 6262 plus 1010, or 7272. The seventh term is 7272 plus 1010, or 8282.

In this sequence, each term is 10 greater than the previous term. Hint 2: This exercise is a practice of arithmetic sequences, which are sequences in which each term can be generated from the previous term by adding or subtracting a fixed constant. In this case, the difference between consecutive terms is 10. Therefore, the terms are evenly spaced.### Package ID:  STACKED   #Package ID: STACKED \nOnline tutoring platform from India.
