The slope of a line perpendicular to such an original line will be undefined. Thus, we need to ensure that the denominator$5$is nonzero.To accomplish this, we solve the original equation for$y:\\begin{align*} \\frac{x}4-\\frac{y}5&=1\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad -\\frac{y}5&=\\frac{x}4-1\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad y&=-\\frac{5}{4}(x-4)\\\\ &=\\frac{5}{4}x-5 \\end{align*}$Thus, we can write the equation of the original line as $\\boxed{y=\\frac{5}{4}x-5}.$Now we can use the definition of slope: $\\slope=\\frac{\\text{rise}}{\\text{run}}=\\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}.$To find the slope of the original line, we can just use this definition.
