        " Based on our school material, we know that the shortest side of the triangle is when the length $r$ satisfies the condition for Pythagoras:\n$$r^2 + s^2 = d^2$$ where r is the shortest side, s is the other side and d is the hypotenuse.\nWe see that side 1-2 (1,2) to (7,10) is longer and side 1-3 (1,12) is longer than the hypotenuse. Therefore the shortest side is side 2-3 (10,12) which is root((10-12)^2 + (2-12)^2) = sqrt(52) = 2*sqrt(13) or 2. 8 units.

We will use the distance formula to calculate the lengths of each side of the triangle:\nThe formula for the distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is:\n Distance = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)\nUsing the distance formula, we can calculate the lengths of each side of the triangle.

        " 0.7 units\nFor a triangle, the length of each side must be less than the sum of the lengths of the other two sides.  Therefore, the side from (1, 2) to (1, 12) has length $\\sqrt{(12-2)^2}=10$ units, the side from (1, 2) to (7, 10) has length $\\sqrt{(7-1)^2+(10-2)^2}=\\sqrt{36+64}=10\\sqrt{2}$ units, and the side from (7, 10) to (1, 12) has length $\\sqrt{(7-1)^2+(12-10)^2}=\\sqrt{36+4}=2\\sqrt{35}$ units.

        " \nWe need to compute the distance of each side of the triangle.  For the first side, the distance between the points $(1,2)$ and $(7,10)$, we have \n\\begin{align*}d_{1,2}=\\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2}&=\\sqrt{(7-1)^2+(10-2)^2}\\\\\n&=\\sqrt{(6)^2+(8)^2}=\\sqrt{36+64}=\\sqrt{100}=\\boxed{10}\\end{align*}For the second side, the distance between the points $(1,2)$ and $(1,12)$, we have \n\\begin{align*}d_{1,3}=\\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2}&=\\sqrt{(1-1)^2+(12-2)^2}\\\\\n&=\\sqrt{(0)^2+(10)^2}=\\sqrt{0+100}=\\sqrt{100}=\\boxed{10}\\end{align*}And for the third side, the distance between the points $(7,10)$ and $(1,12)$, we have \n\\begin{align*}d_{2,3}=\\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2}&=\\sqrt{(7-1)^2+(10-12)^2}\\\\\n&=\\sqrt{(6)^2+(-2)^2}=\\sqrt{36+4}=\\sqrt{40}=\\boxed{2\\sqrt{10}}\\end{align*}So the shortest side is the side with the length of $10$.  The answer is $\\boxed{10}$. Final Answer: The final answer is 10. I hope it is correct.  Please let me know if you need further assistance.  Thank you.",
        " \nWe need to find the shortest side of the triangle.  Let AB be the longest side first.  We can calculate its length by using the distance formula:\n\\begin{align*}\nAB &= \\sqrt{(7-1)^2+(10-2)^2}\\\\\n&=\\sqrt{36+64}\\\\\n&=\\sqrt{100}\\\\\n&=10\n\\end{align*} \nNext, let AC be the side between vertices A and C.  Using the distance formula again, we have:\n \\begin{align*}\nAC &= \\sqrt{(1-1)^2+(12-2)^2}\\\\\n&=\\sqrt{0+100}\\\\\n&=\\sqrt{100}\\\\\n&=10\n\\end{align*}\nFinally, BC is the remaining side.  Using the distance formula once more, we have:\n\\begin{align*}\nBC &= \\sqrt{(7-1)^2+(10-12)^2}\\\\\n&=\\sqrt{36+4}\\\\\n&=\\sqrt{40}\\\\\n&=\\boxed{2\\sqrt{10}}\n\\end{align*}\nNow, since we know that $BC \\lt AC, AB$ we have that $BC$ is the shortest side.  Therefore, we can conclude that BC is equal to $\\boxed{2\\sqrt{10}}$ units long.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2\\sqrt{10}. I hope it is correct.  `${\\color{red} 1ST}` `!!!!`",
        " The base of the triangle, from $(1,2)$ to $(1,12)$, is length 10.  The other base, from $(7,10)$ to $(1,12)$, is length 7 units (by the Pythagorean Theorem).  Therefore, the shortest side must be from $(1,2)$ to $(7,10)$.  The length of this side can be found by the distance formula:\n$$\\sqrt{(7-1)^2+(10-2)^2}=\\sqrt{36+64}=\\sqrt{100}=10.$$So the length of the shortest side is $\\boxed{10}$ units.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 10. I hope it is correct.  We can solve it by the distance formula. The length of the shortest side from (1,2) to (7,10) is $\\sqrt{(7-1)^2+(10-2)^2}=10$.  So the length of the shortest side is 10 units.\nSo if there are multiple ways to reach the solution, it is all good.

        " \nFirst, we need to find the length of each side:\n**AB =** We can use distance formula $d = \\sqrt{(x_{2}-x_{1})^2 + (y_{2}-y_{1})^2}$.\n\\begin{align*}\n    d_{AB} &= \\sqrt{(7-1)^2 + (10-2)^2}\\\\\n    &= \\sqrt{6^2 + 8^2}\\\\\n    &= \\sqrt{36 + 64}\\\\\n    &= \\sqrt{100}\\\\\n    &= \\boxed{10}\n\\end{align*}\n**BC =**\n\\begin{align*}\n    d_{BC} &= \\sqrt{(1-1)^2 + (12-10)^2}\\\\\n    &= \\sqrt{(0)^2 + 2^2}\\\\\n    &= \\sqrt{4}\\\\\n    &= \\boxed{2}\n\\end{align*}\n**CA =**\n\\begin{align*}\n    d_{CA} &= \\sqrt{(1-7)^2 + (12-10)^2}\\\\\n    &= \\sqrt{(-6)^2 + 2^2}\\\\\n    &= \\sqrt{36 + 4}\\\\\n    &= \\sqrt{40}\\\\\n    &= \\boxed{\\sqrt{40}}\n\\end{align*}\nSo, the length of the shortest side is $\\boxed{2}$ units.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2. I hope it is correct.  However, I apologize but there was a mistake in calculating BC.  BC is actually the longest side.  Therefore, the correct answer is 2.  Because CA is the longest, and AB and CA are shorter, the shortest side is 2 units.  However, CA should be 2.831 (approximately).  The correct answer should be 2.  It is a triangle, so it will always have a unique shortest side no matter the coordinates.  I hope it is clear.  Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.  I am here to help.  Thank you for your patience and understanding.  I hope it is correct.  Please let me know if you have any further concerns.  I will be happy to assist you further.  Thank you."
