The largest digit is 9, so we'd like to find a digit $a$ such that 4, $a$, 9 is a geometric sequence.  The condition that 4, $a$, 9 is a geometric sequence is equivalent to $\\frac{9}{a}=\\frac{a}{4}$, which by clearing denominators is equivalent to $36=a^2$, which has solutions $a=\\pm 6$.  One of these solutions is a digit, so $a=6$ and $b=9$ are the maximum values of $a$ and $b$.  If $b$, $c$, 5 is an arithmetic sequence, then the $c$ equals the average of $b$ and $5$, which is $(9+5)/2=7$.  So, $abc=\\boxed{697}$.",

For $4,a,b$ to be a geometric sequence, we must have $b/a = 4kq / 4k = q$, so $q = 1$.\nNow, for $b,c,5$ to be an arithmetic sequence, we must have $c = b+d = 4k + d$ for some constant $d$.\nAlso, $c-5 = 4k+d-5$, so the constant $d$ is $-1$ and $c = 4k-1$.\nSince $a,b,c$ are the digits of the number, which is the maximum 3-digit number, we have $c\\geq 1, b\\geq 2, a\\leq 9$.

Understanding the concept of geometric sequences and arithmetic sequences would take time. With practice and repetition it can be more obvious how to combine these things together to solve problems like this. This problem is an example of how one can design a sequence from multiple sources. Another way of solving this problem would be by guessing and checking the numbers. Guessing the numbers and checking them against the given conditions is a more time-consuming method, but it can be useful in cases where you are not able to find the pattern in the problem. I encourage you to practice this one and similar problems to enhance your understanding of the concept. A mind map can be created for this problem.

Then $b=4r$, and the next term in the sequence $c$ is $br=r^2 \\cdot 4 = 4r^2$. The common difference in the arithmetic sequence $b, c, 5$ is $c-b=5-b$. So $b+ (5-b) = c$, or $b+5-c=0$.

        " First, let's think about the geometric sequence $4,a,b$. Since $4$ is the smallest number, this means that $\\frac{a}{4}=\\frac{b}{a}$. Simplifying this, we have $a^2=4b$.

In this case, $b=9$.\n### Now, let's think about the arithmetic sequence $b,c,5$. Since $b$ is the first number, the second number $c$ is just one greater than $b$, so $c=b+1$. We know $b=9$.

Now, we have to consider the conditions that $b,c,5$ forms an arithmetic sequence. Therefore, we obtain $$c=5-\\frac{b-5}{2}=\\frac{1}{2}.$$However, we know that $b=a^2=4$ is the square of an integer. Therefore, $b$ must be either $1$ or $4$. We can replace these values to obtain $$c=5-\\frac{1-5}{2}=\\frac{4}{2}=2,$$$$c=5-\\frac{4-5}{2}=0.$$The first case, $c=2$, is valid since it is an integer. Therefore, we obtain the biggest three-digit number to be $\\boxed{472}$.",
        " 1083\nStep 1: Write the two given sequences. Since we know that $4,a,b$ is a geometric sequence, we know $a = 4r$ and $b=4r^2$ for some real number $r$. Then we have\n\\begin{align*}\nb &= 4r^2,\\\\\nc &= b+d,\\\\\n5 &= c+d,\\\\\nd &= 5-c,\n\\end{align*}so $d = 5-b$ and $c = b+d = 5 - 4r^2 + 4r^2 = 5$.  We also know that $b,c,5$ is an arithmetic sequence, so $c = b+d = 5$.\nStep 2: Write the system of equations in terms of $r$. From the first sequence, we know $b = 4r^2$ and $a = 4r$. From the second sequence, we know $b = c = 5$ and $d = 5-b = 5-4r^2$. Rewriting the above equations, we get\n\\begin{align*}\na &= 4r,\\\\\nb &= 4r^2,\\\\\nc &= 5,\\\\\nd &= 5-4r^2,\\\\\n5 &= c+d = 5+(5-4r^2).\n\\end{align*}This simplifies to\n$$r^2 = 1.$$Step 3: Solve for $a,b,c,d$ using the two equations in Step 2 that we know from the first sequence. In addition, since we know that $r^2 = 1$, we can determine that $r = 1$. Then we have\n\\begin{align*}\na &= 4r = 4,\\\\\nb &= 4r^2 = 4,\\\\\nb &= 4.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $d = 5-4 = 1$. We know that $b$ is the greatest possible 3-digit number, which we can determine by writing out the solutions to the above systems.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 1083.

        " Let $b$ be the greatest common factor of the greatest common factor of $4$ and $5$, and let $c$ be the greatest divisor of $b$ such that $c$ and $6$ are positive. So, replace \u2019a\u2018 which is $12$ and b\u2018 which is $3$. So, 456.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 456. I hope it is correct.  If we list the three digit number with the desired properties, with 100\u2019s digit at $m$, 10\u2019s digit at $n$, and 1\u2019s digit at $o$, then $4, m, o$ are in a geometric sequence, and $o, n, m$ are in an arithmetic sequence.  We have that $n = 2o$, and $m = \\dfrac{4o}{o}$ is arbitrary.  Furthermore, since $o$ should be less than $m$, and both are less than $10$, the possible values of $o$ are $1$ and $3$, with corresponding values of $m$ being $4$ and $12$, respectively.  If $o = 1$, then $n = 2$, so that the three digit number is $412$, which is not the greatest.  If $o = 3$, then $n = 6$, and the three digit number is $\\boxed{456}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 456. I hope it is correct. We used the property that any number less than 10 can only be factored into prime numbers other than itself and one.  So the number 4 cannot be factored into prime numbers other than 2 and 1.  Therefore, we need to find the greatest three number whose product gives 4.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 456. I hope it is correct. We know that $4,a,b$ is a geometric sequence, so $b=a\\cdot 4/a=4$, meaning $a=1$.  Therefore, the greatest three-digit number \"abc\" such that $4,a,b$ forms a geometric sequence is 416. We also know that $b,c,5$ forms an arithmetic sequence, so $c=5-b$.  Notice that $c$ must be positive, so $0 \\le b\\le 5$.  The only value of $b$ that satisfies the conditions that $b\\le5$, $c$ is positive",
        " To find our answer, we should first find the first term $4$ of a geometric sequence $4, a, b, b$ with $a$ and $b$ chosen so that the difference quotient $\\frac{b-a}{1}$ is rational.\nIf $b-a$ is rational, then so is $\\frac{b-a}{1}$, i.e., $b-a$ must be an integer, so $b=a+k$ for some integer $k$.  Thus we are looking for a number divisible by $4$ such that both $4$ and it are multiples of another integer $a$ (say, $\\frac{a+4}{4}=a+\\frac{1}{4}$).  If $a$ is small, we can easily check via test division all possible values to see if $a+4$ is a multiple of $4$.  We see that the first integer $a$ that satisfies this condition is $a=8$.

        "  First, we can observe that the radius of the geometric sequence $4,a,b$ must be $4/4=\\frac{1}{4}$, so $b=\\frac{1}{4}a$, $a = 4a^2$.  Thus, the maximum possible value of $a$ is when $a=2$, for which $b=\\frac{1}{4}a = \\frac{1}{4}\\cdot 2 = \\frac{1}{2}$.  Therefore, $abc=244$ or $242$.\n### Next, we will find the maximum value of $c$ for $b,c,5$ forming an arithmetic sequence.  We know that $b,c,5$ is an arithmetic sequence, so we have the following equation:\n\\begin{equation*}\nc=5+(b-5)=\\frac{1}{2}-5=-\\frac{9}{2}\n\\end{equation*}\nTaking into account the constraint that $c$ must be an integer, we obtain that $c$ must be $-4$ or $-5$.  However, we know that the maximum value of $c$ is $c=5-(b-5)=5-(\\frac{1}{2}-5)=\\frac{9}{2}$, in the case when $b$ is the maximum.  Therefore, the minimum possible value of $c$ is $-4$, and the maximum possible value of $c$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{9}{2}}$.\nTherefore, we conclude that the greatest possible number for $abc$ is $942$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 942.

        " We know that $$4, a,b$$ are in a geometric progression, which means $$a = 4*r, b = 4 * r^2,$$where $r$ is a real number.  It must hold that $4 < a < b$, so $r>1$.  Since $a$ and $b$ are three-digit numbers, $10 < 4 * r < 100$, which implies $2.5 < r < 25$.  We also know that $$b, c,5$$ are in an arithmetic progression, which means $$c = b + k$$ and $$c = 5 - k$$ for some integer $k$.  We have $b = 4 * r^2$, so $$c = 4 * r^2 + k = 5-k.$$The above expression gives $$4 * r^2 + k + k = 5,$$which gives $$4 * r^2 = 5 - 2k \\ge 2.5 - 4k.$$Since $4*r^2>0$, we must have that $r \\ge 1$.  Since $a$ and $b$ are integers, $r$ must be an integer, and thus $k \\ge 0$.  Since $2\\cdot4 \\ge 5-8$, we require $r \\le 2.5$ and $k \\le 2$.  Combining all the information given, we see that $2 < r \\le 2.5$ and $0 \\le k \\le 2$, and now we just need to solve the equation $5-k=4*r^2+k$.  We have $4*r^2+k=5-k$, and now we substitute in our ranges for $r$ and $k$, and solve for $k$ by hand: $$5 - k = 4*r^2 + k$$ becomes $$-5 = (4 * r^2) + k - k = 4*r^2,$$which is satisfied for $r = 2$ and $k = 1$, and we find our desired maximum value is $\\boxed{994}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 994.

        " First, let $4, a$ be in a geometric sequence, then $4, a = 4 r^1, 4 r^2$ where $r$ is the common multiple. Then it follows that $a = 4r$ and $4r^2 = 16r r$. Here, we can find the value of $r, 4r = 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72, 80, 88, 96 \\ldots$. In the three-digit number range, it is from 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72, 80, 88, 96. We can immediately eliminate 24, as 24 is less than 100. Then, we have a few remaining choices to be made, as they are all greater than 100.\n### Next, we have to state that the three-digit number ab is also in a geometric sequence, i.e.,$b, c$of $b, c, 5$ is also an arithmetic sequence. In mathematics, you can form an arithmetic sequence in one of the ways, where $b = c+d$, $c = b+d$ or $c = b-d$. But here, since we want to find an answer that has only a few options, we can start by looking at $c = b+d$ first. For instance, $96 - 1 = 95$.\n96 = 56 + 40\nHere, the single letter numbers become:\nabc = 560\nIn an alternative solution, we can find that $8+4=12$. From 12, there are a few remaining choices, but 96 - 8 = 88,\n88 + 8 = 96\nFinally, there is only one remaining choice: 56 + 40 = 96\nAfter finishing, we can finally get an answer.",
        " \n1. Assume $4,a,b$ forms a geometric sequence:\n\\begin{align*}\na&=4k\\\\\nb&=4k^2\n\\end{align*} \n2. Similarly, $b,c,5$ forms an arithmetic sequence:\n\\begin{align*}\nb-c&=5-4k^2\\\\\nc&=5-(4k^2-4k)=5-(4k^2-k)=5-4k(k-1)\n\\end{align*}\nNow to get the largest $3$-digit number, we can choose $k$ as smaller as possible.\n3. Therefore, $c=4$ and $b-c=5-4k^2-k=1 \\Rightarrow k^2=1.25 \\Rightarrow k=0.5$ which gives $k>1$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 964.
