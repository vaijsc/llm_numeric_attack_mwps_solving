I'd thought the first solution (dividing 36 by 7 exactly) was correct, but the scorer may have taken issue with showing or discussing it. Also, everyone got 5 as the answer, no matter what technique was used, so it's weird that the first response was marked incorrect. The scorer may have been looking for something specific in the writing, not just the answer. I'm still puzzled... ATITHI EDIT\n(Another ATITHI EDIT) FractalImage did give an alternative solution! I missed it in the initial glance. It was the step-by-step division approach, which may have led to the original response being marked incorrect. The scorer might have been looking for more explanation or steps in the division (which FractalImage also showed). Despite that, FractalImage and I both got 5 as the answer, but the writing was different. I hope that",

        " First, we can think of 36/7 = 5.14 as a number. The \u201c.\u201d is just notation meaning there are parts left over. 5.14 is just a shorthand way of saying 5 $\\frac{14}{100}$. So let\u2019s try to convert that to a conversion fraction. $$\\frac{14}{100} = \\frac{7}{50}$$ since 100 = 10 * 10 and 14 = 2 * 7. Then we need to think of what number times 50 will make 50. $$\\frac{7}{50} = \\frac{7}{50} * 1 = \\frac{7}{50} * \\frac{1}{1}$$ to make sure our denominator is 50. And we need 1 times 50 to equal 50. 1 * 50 is 50. So 1 is really 50/50. So $$\\frac{7}{50} = \\frac{7}{50} * \\frac{1}{1} * \\frac{50}{50} = \\frac{7}{50} * \\frac{1}{1} * \\frac{50}{50}$$ is now converted to $$\\frac{7}{50} = \\frac{7}{50} * \\frac{1}{1} * \\frac{50}{50} = \\frac{7 * 1 * 50}{50 * 1 * 50} = \\frac{350}{2500}$$ Finally, we change 36/7 to our hopefully nice fraction, since 36/7 means 4 * 7/7 plus 4 * 1/7. $$\\frac{36}{7} = \\frac{4 * 7}{7} + \\frac{4 * 1}{7} = \\frac{4 * 7}{7} + \\frac{28}{7} + \\frac{4}{7}$$ $$\\frac{36}{7} = \\frac{28 + 4}{7}$$ $$\\frac{36}{7} = \\frac{32}{7}$$ $$\\frac{36}{7} = 4 \\frac{6}{7}$$ $$\\frac{36}{7} = 4 \\frac{6}{7}$$ $$\\frac{36}{7} = 4 \\frac{42}{7 * 10}$$ $$\\frac",

The units digit should be some whole number (like, say $0$, $1$, $2$, etc.) and the remainder is boxed for now. Then, to find the greatest integer part of the quotient (i.e. the integer part of the decimal shown), we look at the boxed digits and pick the greatest integer that fits, which in this case is $5$.\nHence, dividing $36$ by $7$ would give $\\boxed{5}$ with a remainder of $1$.

To answer your second question, there are many tools that can help you solve problems in your field of study, but some of the most useful ones for statistics and data science include:\n1. pandas for data manipulation and analysis, especially for dealing with data of different types and sizes.\n2. NumPy for numerical computations and data manipulation, especially useful for numerical linear algebra.\n3. Matplotlib for data visualization.  It is very powerful and flexible, it can be a bit overwhelming for beginners, but I like to make you aware that there are many examples out there.\n3. Seaborn for statistical graphics. If you want to do statistical analysis and have a python set up see here for a way to do it.\n4.

In general, we know that $\\left\\lfloor x \\right\\rfloor$ evaluates to the largest integer less than or equal to $x$.  To better understand this, let's first evaluate the fraction $\\frac{36}{7}$:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{36}{7}&=5.\\overline{1}\n\\end{align*}Since the decimal part repeats, so we see that the fraction is between 5 and 6.  Because the decimal part is greater than 0, we know that $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{36}{7}\\right\\rfloor < 6$.  However, $5 < \\frac{36}{7}$ since the decimal part is less than 0.4.
