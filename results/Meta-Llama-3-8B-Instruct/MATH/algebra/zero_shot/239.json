Therefore, $xy = 0$ cannot hold. We can use this logical conclusion for our solution.\nThe given equations become, \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{x}+\\frac{1}{y}&=5,\\\\\nxy&=0.\n\\end{align*}\nBy the first equation, \\begin{align*}\nxy \\left(\\frac{1}{x}+\\frac{1}{y}\\right)&=5xy\\\\\nxy\\left(\\frac{y}{yx}+\\frac{x}{yx}\\right)&=5xy\\\\\ny+x&=5xy\n\\end{align*}From here, we can use the second equation to eliminate variables. $y+x=4$ and $xy = 0$. Either one or both could be equal to zero. Using cases (\\school\tpublic/public/internal/).\nCase 1: $xy = 0$, $y = 0$, and $x \\neq 0$ implies that $xy = 0 \\cdot x = 0$, which does not equal zero. Therefore, this case is ignored.\nCase 2: $xy=0$, $x = 0$, and $y \\neq 0$ implies that $xy = 0 \\cdot y = 0$, which equals zero, a valid solution. Therefore, we can compute $x^2y+xy^2$. $x^2y+xy^2 = \\boxed{0}$, because $x^2y+xy^2 = \\left(x^2+xy \\right)y$ using distribution.\nFinal Answer:\u00a0The final answer is 0.\u00a0I hope it is correct.",

        " We are given a system of two equations in variables $x$ and $y$.\n$$\\frac{1}{x}+\\frac{1}{y}=5$$\nand\n$$3xy+x+y=4$$\nOur task is to solve for $x^2y+xy^2$.
