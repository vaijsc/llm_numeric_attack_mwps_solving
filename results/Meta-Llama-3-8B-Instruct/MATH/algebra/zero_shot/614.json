        " $x = \\boxed{9}$\nWe start by simplifying $\\frac{1}{8}$ in the equation as follows:\n$$2^{12} \\= \\left(\\frac{1}{2^{3}}\\right)^x$$We now simplify the right side of the equation to get: $$2^{12} = \\frac{1}{2^{3x}}$$We can simplify the equation further by dividing both sides by $2^{3x}$ as follows: $$2^{12} \\div 2^{3x} = 2^{0}$$\nWe can simplify each side of the equation further by rewriting it in exponent form:\n$$2^{12-3x} = 1$$We now want to see what value of $x$ makes $2^{12-3x} = 1$. In this case, $12 - 3x = 0$, so $3x = 12$ and, thus, $x = \\boxed{9}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 9. I hope it is correct. ### Another way is to solve the equation for x using logarithms. To solve this equation for $x$, let\u2019s rewrite it in logarithmic form: $$\\log_2 2^{12} = \\log_2 \\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right)^x$$The left side simplifies to $12$. The right side can be converted from logarithmic form to exponential form as follows: $$12 = -3x$$So we get: $$x = \\frac{-12}{3} = \\boxed{9}$$This also gives $x = 9$ which agrees with our earlier solution. It\u2019s always useful to check your solutions multiple ways!\nLet\u2019s summarize our solutions:\n1. Write the equation as $\\frac{1}{8}^{x} = 2^{12}$, multiply both sides by $2^{3x}$ to get $2^{12-3x} = 1$, then solve for x to get $x = 9$.\n2. Write the equation in logarithmic form $\\log_2 2^{12} = \\log_2 \\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right)^x$, then simplify to $12 = -3x$, then solve for x to get $x = 9$.\nIn both ways, we find that $x = 9$. Therefore, if $2^{12} = \\left(\\",

I hope it is correct. \ud83d\ude05\nSo in the first step, we need to rewrite the fraction $\\frac{1}{8}$ in the form of $(\\frac{1}{2})^3$ to simplify the equation:\n$$2^{12}=(\\frac{1}{8})^x=(\\frac{1}{2})^{3x}.$$Now, as $8=2^3$, we have\n$$2^{12}=(2^3)^{-x}=2^{-3x}.$$Thus, we must have $-3x=12$, so\n$$\\boxed{x=-4}.$$However, the problem states that $x$ must be a positive integer, so the answer is incorrect. \ud83d\ude14 \u0645\u06cc\u0645. \ud83e\udd2f\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -4.

        "  We begin by using the exponent rule of reciprocals: $$\\left(\\frac{1}{a}\\right)^{-b} = a^b$$We also use the rule that $(a^b)^c = a^{bc}$ to separate the exponents, $$2^{12} = \\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right)^x = \\frac{1}{8^x}$$Then, after applying the exponent rule for reciprocals again, we obtain $$2^{12} = 8^{-x}$$Now, we use a trick to create an equivalent equation that is easier to solve. We can write $$8^{-x} = \\left(2^3\\right)^{-x} = 2^{-3x}$$So, we have $$2^{12} = 2^{-3x}$$Now, we can use the exponent rule for exponents again, $$2^{12} = 2^{-3x} \\implies 12 = -3x$$Finally, we solve for $x$ by dividing by $-3$.$$x = \\boxed{-4}$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -4.

The final answer is -4. I hope it is correct. I hope it is helpful.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is",
