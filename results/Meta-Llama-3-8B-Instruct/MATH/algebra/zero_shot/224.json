Drawing a diagram, it is easy to see they are opposite each other.\nLet $C$ and $D$ be the other two vertices. We can draw a line parallel to $AB$ through $C$ and $D$ that passes through the average of $A$ and $B$, which is $\\dfrac{(1-4, -2+10)}{2}$. We draw that line.\nWe need to find the coordinates of $C$ and $D$. An equation in point slope form for our line is $y - (-2) = \\dfrac{-2+10}{1+4}(x-1)$. Simplifying, we have $$y = -2 + \\dfrac{2}{5}(x-1) = \\dfrac{2}{5}x - \\dfrac{12}{5}$$\nSo, for $(x, y) = C$, we have $\\dfrac{2}{5}x - \\dfrac{12}{5} = -2$, which gives us $\\dfrac{2}{5}x = \\dfrac{8}{5}$, so $x = 4$. Substituting, we get $y = 2$.\nThus, $C$ has coordinates $(4,2)$.\nSimilarly, for $(x, y) = D$, we have $\\dfrac{2}{5}x - \\dfrac{12}{5} = 10$, which gives us $\\dfrac{2}{5}x = \\dfrac{62}{5}$, so $x = -2$.

The distance from the point $(-4,10)$ is $|2-10|=8$.  Both distances are equal to the length of the perpendicular distance from the direction $(1,2)$.

So, there must be two other vertices which are non-adjacent to $A$ and $B$. We will denote the points of these as $C$ and $D$, respectively. The two sides of the square adjacent to $A$ are $AB$ and $AC$, where $AB$ is the given line, and $AC$ is a diagonal from $A$ to $C$ (because they are adjacent).\n$\\textnormal{Step 2}:$ The line $AB$ is given, and we can find its length as follows: \\begin{align*} \\sqrt{((-4-1)^2+(10-(-2))^2)} & =\\sqrt{(25+144)} \\\\& =\\sqrt{169} \\\\& =13 \\end{align*}Therefore, $AB$ has length 13.\n$\\textnormal{Step 3}:$ Now we have to find the length of $AC$. In a square, all diagonals are congruent. This means, for a square to maintain symmetry, there must be another diagonal, along with $AC$, which connects the other two vertices, $C$ and $D$. This other diagonal is $BD$. Therefore, $AC$ and $BD$ will have the same length. The corresponding sides of the square will also have the same length.\n$\\textnormal{Step 4}:$ To find the length of $AC$ (or $BD$), we need to set up a system of equations using the distance formula for points $A$, $B$, $D$: \\begin{align*} \\sqrt{((-4+1)^2+(10-(-2))^2)} & =\\sqrt{(19)^2} \\\\ \\sqrt{(-4-x)^2+(10-y)^2} & =\\sqrt{(19)^2} \\end{align*}Simplifying the equations, we get \\begin{align*} \\sqrt{(-3)^2+144} & =19 \\\\ (-4-x)^2+(10-y)^2 & =19^2 \\\\ x & =\\boxed{7} \\\\ y & =\\boxed{1} \\end{align*}$\\text",

        " To find the perimeter of the square, we must first find the length of each side of the square. Since the two given points are adjacent vertices of the square, the point on the square that is directly opposite these two vertices is the midpoint of the segment joining the two points. To find this point, we can average the coordinates of $(1,-2)$ and $(-4,10)$. This gives the point $$\\left(\\frac{1-4}{2},\\frac{-2+10}{2}\\right)=(-\\frac{3}{2},4).$$ The points $(1,-2)$ and $(-4,10)$ and the midpoint $(-\\frac{3}{2},4)$ form a rectangle. Since the opposite sides of a rectangle are parallel, they are either horizontal or vertical. The difference of the $y$-coordinates of $(-4,10)$ and $(1,-2)$ is $10-(-2)=12$, which implies that the rectangle is either $10$ units tall or $12$ units tall. Since $(-\\frac{3}{2},4)$ lies on the segment joining $(1,-2)$ and $(-4,10)$, this implies that it lies below the line $y=-2$ (since $(-4,10)$ lies above this line) and that it lies below the line $y=10$ (since $(1,-2)$ lies below this line). This implies that it must lie on the horizontal line $y=-2$. Now, since the segment joining $(1,-2)$ and $(-4,10)$ has length $\\sqrt{81+144}=15$, this implies that the rectangle formed by $(-4,10)$, $(1,-2)$, and $(-\\frac{3}{2},4)$ must be $15$ units wide.
