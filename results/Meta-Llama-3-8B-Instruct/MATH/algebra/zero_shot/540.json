From this, we obtain $x^3 - y^3 = ((y + 1) + y)((y + 1)^2 - y^2) = (y + 1 + y)((y + 1)^2 - y^2) = 2y(y + 1)$. 2y(y+1) is not an integer, so substituting y into -3 and 1 does not work. Let\u2019s simplify y: Let y = 2, then y + 1 = 3. So $x = 3, y = 2, x^2 + y^2 = 9 + 4 = 13, x-y = 3-2 = 1, x^3 - y^3 = (3)(64) - (8)(1) = 112 - 8 = 104$. But $x^2 + y^2 \\neq 7$. Okay!
