        " The graphs intersect at $x=-10.00112996$, at which the largest $x$-value is involved.\nSince the graphs of $f$ and $g$ are polynomials, we can try to find the intersection point by solving the equation $f(x)=g(x)$. Both $f$ and $g$ have been written exactly the same, except for the $72x^4+4x^3-11x^2-6x+13$ in $g$, which appears in contrast to the $72x^4+3x^3-6x^2+2x+1$ in $f$. Hence, we may let $P(x)$ be a new polynomial defined as: $$P(x)=(72x^4+3x^3)+4x^3-(72x^4+4x^3)+...=(x^3(-72+4))=(x^3(-68)).$$Here, $-68$ is the coefficient of $P$\u2019s highest degree term. We can solve the equation $f(x)=g(x)$ by finding zero of polynomial $P(x)$: $$0=P(x)=x^3(-68).$$Then, we could solve for $x$: $$x=\\sqrt[3]{0}=-10.00112996.$$This is the value of intersection with the largest $x$-value. The second component of solution will tell the exact value of when the intersection made. The grade-school-level steps satisfied this given problem were to follow what it says, thus this means the given information can be broken down into individual pieces. We are supported by the given information used here to find solution, and for the ease, it seems likely for anyone to figure out exponentiation by now! A formula for solving (or the formula for solving an expression) may operate through the power of translation/notation and diagram-making operation algorithms. Solving two similar equations and solving at the intersection point by using only the power of translation formula expression methods of various given combinations can be very helpful. After that, the final answer was obtained. Finally, \u2013 10.000112996 has been been obtained.\n### Final Answer: The final answer is $-10.00112996$ .

        " Step 1: Clarifying the question.\nWe should consider that how they will intersect. Since we know both functions are continuous, there can\u2019t be any intersection on the irrational or transcendental points. Therefore, the point of intersection must be a rational point. Recall that the floor function $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ is an integer function. So, we only need to find the rational points where the functions have the same $y$-value.\n### Step 2: Plugging in $x$.\nTo simply our equation, let\u2019s plug in any rational value for $x$, say, $r$. Since $r$ is rational, $|\\lfloor r \\rfloor|$ is also rational. For the sake of simplicity, let $|\\lfloor r \\rfloor |=n$. Then, the equations simplify to:\n\\begin{align*}\nf(x)&=e^{3r^2-n!}+\\binom{22+735235n}{2356}+\\phi(n+1)+72r^4+3r^3-6r^2+2r+1\\\\\ng(x)&=e^{3r^2-n!}+\\binom{22+735235n}{2356}+\\phi(n+1)+72r^4+4r^3-11r^2-6r+13\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n### Step 3: Evaluating the equations.\nThe terms $e^{3r^2-n!}$, $\\binom{22+735235n}{2356}$, and $\\phi(n+1)$ are constants, which means their difference is also a constant. Then, we have:\n\\begin{align*}\n73r^4+(-9)r^3+(-6)r^2+(2)r+(28)&=4r^3-11r^2-6r+13\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\quad 72r^4+(-44)r^3-(-2)r^2+(8)r&=0\n\\end{align*}",
        " Step 1: Understand the question Let\u2019s define $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ as the given functions. Clearly, the value of $|\\lfloor x \\rfloor|$ is always an integer. Also, $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ can be zero, since $x\\in [-\\infty, \\infty)$. We are asked to find the value of $x$ at which $f(x)=g(x)$, denoted as $x_0$. For simplicity, let\u2019s denote the integer part of $x$ as $n$, such that $\\lfloor x \\rfloor=n$. Therefore, we can simplify $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ as: $$f(x)=e^{3x^2-n!}+\\binom{22+735235n}{2356}+\\phi(n+1)+72x^4+3x^3-6x^2+2x+1$$ $$g(x)=e^{3x^2-n!}+\\binom{22+735235n}{2356}+\\phi(n+1)+72x^4+4x^3-11x^2-6x+13$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\sqrt{11}. I hope it is correct. Let\u2019s do some thinking for step 2. It could be really helpful! Also, we need to consider step 3 about finding the x value. Please tell us what you think about it. We can avoid bad answers. Therefore, let\u2019s please think about the given functions f(x) and g(x).\nIt seems like we can see that both f(x) and g(x) contain a similar term e^{3x^2-n!} and the binomial coefficient \\binom{22+735235n}{2356} + \\phi(n+1). Let\u2019s try to simplify this term first. For instance, can we solve for n? I think so. We have n! e^{3x^2-n!} from the combined term in both f(x) and g(x). Notice that when n! > 0, the \\logarithmic term negative. Also, n!/>0, which is an increasing term (because if n \\\\(0e^{3x^2-n!}. When n\\\\\">}$0e^{3x^2-n!$, this exponential term is less than unity. Hence, when e^{3x^2-n!}",
        " So we want to find the largest x such that f(x) = g(x).\n### Now, note that f(x) = g(x) \\Leftrightarrow f(x)-g(x) = 0.\nWe simplify this expression to obtain: e^{3x^2-\\lfloor x \\rfloor !}+72x^4+3x^3-9x^2+3x - 1 +\\left(\\binom{22+735235|\\lfloor x \\rfloor |}{2356}+\\phi(|\\lfloor x \\rfloor |+1)-\\binom{22+735235|\\lfloor x \\rfloor |}{2356}-\\phi(|\\lfloor x \\rfloor |+1)\\right) + 4x^3-7x^2-12x+12 = 0 but the second expression is always zero so we can ignore it. So we get, e^{3x^2-\\lfloor x \\rfloor !}+72x^4+3x^3-9x^2+3x - 1 = 0 It seems like the only way the equation would be satisfied is if e^{3x^2-\\lfloor x \\rfloor !} = 0, which could only happen at x = 0, while x needs to be an integer because of the floor function. However, this is a very naive approach because we are neglecting the values that involve exponentiation. For example, even though e^{3x^2-\\lfloor x \\rfloor !} could be near zero, it is not necessarily equal to zero. So, while there may be no values of x greater than 0, there could still be a solution. Therefore, let\u2019s get the derivative of f(x) - g(x).",
        " We shall answer this question in the following steps:\n#### Step 1: Observations\nWe observe that $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ is an integer (the floor function of a real number is always an integer). This means that our expressions do not depend on the fractional part of $x$. In particular, if we can find $m\\in \\mathbb{Z}$ such that $f(m)$ and $g(m)$ are the same, then these two graphs are tangent at $x=m$, which implies that our intersection point is $x=m$.\n#### Step 2: Simplification of our expressions\nWe have $f(x)=e^{3x^2-a!}+C+72x^4+3x^3-6x^2+2x+1$ and $g(x)=e^{3x^2-a!}+C+72x^4+4x^3-11x^2-6x+13$, where $a=\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ and $C$ is some constant. In particular, they have the same $a!$-term, which means that if we can solve $f(m)=g(m)$ for $m$, we can solve our original problem.\n#### Step 3: Solving the equation\nWe have \\begin{align*}\nf(m)&=g(m)\\\\\n\\Rightarrow 72m^4+3m^3-6m^2+2m+1&=4m^3-11m^2-6m+12\\\\\n\\Rightarrow 68m^4-12m^3-22m^2-8m+(-11)&=0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow (4m-1)(17m^3+8m^2+22m-11)&=0\n\\end{align*}The first factor is negative when $m = 1/4$, which does not work, while it is positive when $m\\ge1$, which gives rise to solutions. The second factor is a cubic, and by the rational root theorem, the only potential rational solutions are $\\pm 1, \\pm 11, \\pm 1/17, \\pm 1/221$. We check that none of them work.\nTrying the positive factors of 17 and 11, we find that $m=22$ works, and $$f(22)=e^{3\\cdot 22^2-",
        " By the conditions, we know that $f(x)=g(x)$ hold. From $f(x)-g(x)=e^{3x^2-|\\lfloor x \\rfloor|!} +72x^4+(3x^3-11x^2-3x)-13$. Therefore, we can say $0=f(x)-g(x)$ must hold for the point at which the graph is intersecting.",
        " \n1. First, let\u2019s simplify the problem by noting that the only term that changes between the two functions is the coefficient of $x^3$: the coefficient in $f(x)$ is $3x^3$ and the coefficient in $g(x)$ is $4x^3$.\n2. If we were to graph the two functions, we would see that, starting at $x=-2,$ the slope of the graph of $f(x)$ is increasing faster than the slope of the graph of $g(x).$ Thus, at some point between $x=-2$ and $x=-1,$ the graph of $f(x)$ will start to rise above the graph of $g(x).$ However, at $x=-1,$ the graph of $f(x)$ is at a local minimum and the graph of $g(x)$ is at a local maximum. Hence, $f(x)$ lies below $g(x)$ for all $x$ between and including $x=-1$ and $x=-2.$\n3. By the same logic, at $x=0,$ $f(x)$ is at a local maximum and $g(x)$ is at a local minimum, so $f(x)$ lies above $g(x)$ for $x\\ge0.$ Therefore, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ intersect when $x$ is between $x=-1$ and $x=0,$ inclusive. We can check by direct computation that $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ intersect when $x=0,$ and that $f(x)>g(x)$ for $x\\in\\boxed{(-1,0]}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is x=0.
