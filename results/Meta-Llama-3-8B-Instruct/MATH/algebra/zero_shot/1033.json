Clearly, to make the quadratic complete the square, we need to take half the coefficient of $x$. For that, we need to find $(2.6)/2 = 1.3$. Now, subtract 1.3 squared from both sides to move to the right side: $x^2+(2.6)x + 1.3^2 + 3.6 - 1.3^2$ $= x^2+1.3x+1.69$. $= (x+b)^2+c$. Now, equate coefficients. We get $b = 1.3$ and $c = 1.69$.

        " \nFirst, we need to expand $(x+b)^2+c$.\n$(x+b)^2+c = x^2 + 2bx + b^2 + c$\nWe set this equal to $x^2+(2.6)x+3.6$.\n$x^2 + 2bx + b^2 + c = x^2 + (2.6)x+3.6$\nNow we set $2b$ equal to $2.6$. So $b = 1.3$.\nWe substitute $b = 1.3$ into our first equation.\n$x^2 + 2(1.3)x + (1.3)^2 + c = x^2 + (2.6)x+3.6$\nNow we set $(1.3)^2$ and $c$ equal to $3.6$.\n$x^2 + 2.6x + 1.69 + c = x^2 + 2.6x+3.6$\nWe subtract $x^2 + 2.6x$ from both sides.\n$1.69 + c = 3.6$\nWe subtract $1.69$ from both sides.\n$c = 2$\nWe sum $1.3$ and $2$.\n$1.3+2 = 3.3$",
        " \nLet $x^2+(2.6)x+3.6=(x+b)^2+c$.\nCompleting the square, we have $x^2+2.6x+3.6=(x+b)^2+c= (x+b)^2+c= (x+b)^2+c= (x+b)^2+c$. The perfect square trinomial is a perfect square trinomial.\nAs a result, $$x+b=\\frac{-2.6\\pm\\sqrt{(-2.6)^2-4(1)(3.6)}}{2}=\\frac{-2.6\\pm\\sqrt{-1.4}}{2}=-1.3\u00b10.13i,$$ so $b=\\boxed{-1.3}$. We know that $c=3.6-(b)^2=3.6-1.69=1.91$, and so $b+c=\\boxed{-1.3+1.91=\\boxed{0.58}}$.\n### Solution Explanation: \nThe problem requires us to write the quadratic $x^2+(2.6)x+3.6$ in the form $(x+b)^2+c$. To do that, we complete the square to find the value of $b$. Then, we find the value of $c$ and compute $b+c$.\nWe start by completing the square:\n$$x^2+2.6x+3.6 = (x+?)^2+?$$We want to find the value of $?$. We know that $(x+0.13i)^2=(x-elvis)^2+c$.\n$$x^2+2.6x+3.6 = (x+b)^2+c$$\nWe have $$x+b=\\frac{-2.6\\pm\\sqrt{(-2.6)^2-4(1)(3.6)}}{2}=\\frac{-2.6\\pm\\sqrt{-1.4}}{2}=-1.3\u00b10.13i,$$ so $b=-1.3$.\nWe now have $c=3.6-1.69=1.91$, and so $b+c=0.58$."
