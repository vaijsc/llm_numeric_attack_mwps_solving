The problem gives the numbers between 46 and 64. This means that n is the number of odd numbers between 47 and 63. We can find n by subtracting 46 from 63 (including the 64 because we go up to 64) and dividing by 2 (to get the number of terms):\nn = (63 - 46) / 2 + 1 = 9\nNow, let\u2019s find the sum. We need to calculate the first term (a1 = 47) and the last term (an = 63). Now, use the formula:\n\u03a3 = (n \u00d7 (a1 + an)) / 2\n\u03a3 = (9 \u00d7 (47 + 63)) / 2\n\u03a3 = (9 \u00d7 110) / 2\n\u03a3 = 990 / 2\n\u03a3 = 495\nThe sum of the odd integers between 46 and 64 is 495.

I hope it is correct.(FunctionalTitle)\nNote: The problem can be solved without using a formula by listing the odd numbers and adding them up. However, that would be more tedious and less efficient.

        " \n46 is even, so the next odd integer is 47. The next odd integer after 47 is 49, then 51, ..., and the last odd integer is 63.\nThus, we can list the odd integers between 46 and 64 as follows: 47, 49, 51, ..., 63.\nThe sum of these odd integers is:\n$$S = 47 + 49 + 51 + \\cdots + 63 = \\frac{47 + 63}{2}(9) = \\frac{110}{2} (9) = \\boxed{495}$$\nWe get the sum by making use of the formula for the sum of the terms of an arithmetic sequence. In this case, the last odd integer is 63, and the first is 47, so the common difference between consecutive terms is 2. Since there are $\\frac{63 - 47}{2} + 1 = 9$ terms in this series of odd integers, we can use the formula\n$$S = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$$where $n$ represents the number of terms, and $a_1$ and $a_n$ are the smallest and largest terms, respectively. In our case, $n = 9$ and $a_1 = 47$ and $a_n = 63$, so we can plug these values into the formula and simplify to get that the sum $S$ is equal to $\\boxed{\\frac{110}{2}(9) = 495}$. #calc\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 495. I hope it is correct.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 495. I hope it is correct.\nThe given formula for the sum of n terms of an arithmetic sequence is:\nS = (n/2)*(a1 + an)\nWhere n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term and an is the last term. For the sum of the odd integers between 46 and 64, the first term is 47, the last term is 63 and the number of terms is 9.\nThe sum of the odd integers between 46 and 64 is:\nS = (9/2)*(47 + 63)\nS = (9/2)*(110)\nS = (45/1)*(110)\nS = 495\nHence the sum of the odd integers between 46 and 64 is 495.",
