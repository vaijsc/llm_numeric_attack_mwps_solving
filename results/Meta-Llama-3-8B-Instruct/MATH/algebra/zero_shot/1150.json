        " \nWe start by solving the quadratic. To do this, we can use the quadratic formula, which says that the two solutions for a quadratic of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ are\n\\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}. \n### Correct Step 1\nIn our case, $a = 1, b = -1, \\text{ and } c = -1$, so our two solutions are x = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 - 4}}{2} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{-3}}{2}. \n### Correct Step 2\nIf we add these two solutions, we get x_1 + x_2 = -1.

We will show that $r$ and $s$ can be expressed in terms of $x$, this can be done using Vieta\u2019s formulas. We have $r$ and $s$ are the roots of the equation, which means that they also satisfy the equation:\n$$r^2 - r - 1 = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad s^2 - s - 1 = 0.$$Then we substitute $r = x$ to find:\n$$s = -x - 1$$ and then substitute this value of $s$ into the second equation:\n$$x^2 - x - 1 = 0$$\nSolving for $x$, we find $x = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{2}$.
