        " Given\n### Given Numbers\nThree 3 plus the reciprocal of a number equals 7 divided by that number. Three is written as 3. The reciprocal of a number is written as 1 number. 1/number, 1 divided by the number. So, the equation given is written as 3 + 1/number = 7/number. How to solve it?\n### Step 1\n### Move everything on the left side\nThis means removing the 7/number on the right side. The way to remove it is by taking 7 from the other side.\n### Calculation: 7/number - 7/number\nWhen subtracting the same thing, you subtract the number Common Denominator is 1/number. So, we can add numbers together (no amp). 7/number is subtracted from 7/number. This is 0. And we can add 3. At the same time. It can be written like this: 3 - 0 = 3. So, it becomes 3 + 1/number = 3.\n### Step 2\n### Same as the same single denominator\nUsually, when we solve an equation like this, we have to make the denominator the same. In this case, the denominator is in two places. It\u2019s 1/number on one side and 7/number on the other side. And when we want to make it the same denominator, we make it so that 3 + 1/number will have a denominator of 7/number. -14 3 + 1/number = 3 * 7/number. How can we make it? It can be written like this: 3 * 1 = 3 and 1/number * 7/number = 7/number. 1/number * 7/number can be written as 7/number^2. So, 3 * 7/number = 3 * number/number^2. And right now, the left side has number^2 as the denominator. We subtract 7 from 7/number, and we get 1. So, it becomes: 3 * 1 = 3 number.\n### Step 3\n### Solve\nNow it\u2019s time to solve. The left side is 3 number. The right side is number. So, we subtract 3 from both sides so that the left side becomes number, and the right side is",
        " \nLet\u2019s represent the given instruction in the form of an equation.\n3 + (1/Number) = 7/(Number)\nWe can solve the equation by multiplying both sides by the common denominator, which is (Number).\n(3 + (1/Number)) * (Number) = (7/(Number)) * (Number)\nExpanding both sides of the equation, we get:\n3 * (Number) + 1 = 7\nNext, we can subtract 1 from both sides to get:\n3 * (Number) = 6\nFinally, we can divide both sides by 3 to get:\nNumber = 6/3\nNumber = 2\nSo, the number is 2. \nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2.

The only problem is that we have not solved for n yet.\nTo solve for n, we can multiply both sides by n, which gives us -6n = -6.

Step 3: So, if we divide both sides by 3, we can find the value of x, and that looks like x = 2.  Step 4: So, the number we are looking for is x = 2.\nSo, the number that satisfies the equation is 2.\n",
        " We can start by letting the number be y, and then we can re-write the statement:\n*) = 3 + 1/y\nThe statement tells us that the sum of 3 and 1 over y is equal to 7 over y.  This means that we can factor the right side by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by y:\n*)\nNow we see that the left side is equal to 3 + 1/y, so for this to be true, 3 + 1/y has to be equal to 7/y.  This means that the following equation is true:\n3 + 1/y = 7/y\nTo solve this equation, we subtract 3 from both sides and then multiply both sides by y to get:\n*) = 7/y - 3 = 7 - 3y\nThis means that y is the value for which 7 - 3y is equal to 0, or:\n*)\n*)\n:)\n### Solution: Finally, we can solve the equation by moving all the terms to one side and factoring by recognizing that y is a factor:\n7 - 3y = 0\n*) = 3y - 7 = 0\nNow we can factor the left side by recognizing that the terms have a common factor:\n*) = (3y - 7) = 0\nFinally, we can solve this equation by factoring and factoring until we find the factors:\n*) = (3y - 7) = 0\n*) = 3(y - 7/3) = 0\nNow we can solve for y by recognizing that the factors are both 0 only when y is equal to 7/3:\n3(y - 7/3) = 0\n*) = 3y - 7 = 0\n*) = 3y = 7\n*) = y = 7/3",
        " 2 (or 28)\nLet x be the number. 3 + $\\frac{1}{x}$ = $\\frac{7}{x}$. Multiply both sides by $x$ to eliminate the fraction on the right, $x$ + 3 = 7, then subtract 3 from both sides, $x$ = 4. So the number is 4.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 4. I hope it is correct. ",
        " \nLet x be the number. The formula is:\n$3 + \\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{7}{x}$\nNow, we can simplify the equation:\n$3x + 1 = 7$\nNow, subtract 3x from both sides:\n$1 = 7 - 3x$\nNow, subtract 1 from both sides:\n$0 = 6 - 3x$\nNow, subtract 6 from both sides:\n$-6 = -3x$\nNow, divide both sides by -3:\n$x = \\boxed{2}$",
        " We know that 3 + 1/ x = 7/x.\nWe can express the above as (3)(x)+1 = 7.\n### "
