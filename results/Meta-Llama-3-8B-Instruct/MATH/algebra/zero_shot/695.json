        " Let\u2019s first identify that the given equation $f(x) = ax^4 - bx^2 + x + 5$ has degree four. Then using the given equation $f(-3) = 2$, we can find $a$, $b$ and $c$. Let\u2019s put $x = -3$ and we have\n$$\nf(-3) = a(-3)^4 - b(-3)^2 + (-3) + 5 = 81a - 9b - 3 + 5\n$$\nsince $f(-3) = 2$ we have $$81a - 9b = -4,$$ or $$9a - b = -\\frac{4}{9}.$$Now we need to find $9a-b = -\\frac{4}{9}$. Since f(x) is a degree 4 polynomial, we know that it will go up to the fifth power in the polynomial. Since we know f(-3) = 2, then we know $2 = 81a - 9b - 3 + 5$. So, $$2 + 3 - 5 = 81a - 9b,$$ or $$0 = 81a - 9b - 2.$$Since we know $9a - b = -\\frac{4}{9}$, then $81a - 9b = -\\frac{4}{9} \\times 81$.

Substitute these into the general equation for f(x). $$f(x)=\\frac{1}{6}x^4-\\frac{23}{25}x^2+x+5$$\n### Final ",
        "\u00a0 $$f(x) =ax^4-bx^2+x+5$$ For $f(-3)=2$, we need to solve $f(-3)=a(-3)^4 - b(-3)^2 + (-3) + 5.$ Plugging in the values, we obtain $8a+9b-2=2$, which gives $8a+9b=4$. This can be viewed as a linear equation in two variables, with graph shown in the following picture:\n(Note that the linear graph shows that either $a=0$ and $b > 0$ or $a>0$ and $b \\in (-\\frac{4}{9},0)$.)\nIf $a=0$, then $f(x)=-bx^2+x+5$ and plugging in $x=-3$, we get $5\\ne2$.\nBut if $a\\ne0$, then there are two possibilities:\nIf $b$ is between $-\\frac{4}{9}$ and $0$, then, from $a>0$, we see that $\\boxed{f(3)=a(3)^4-b(3)^2+3+5=27a-9b+8}.$ However, because we got a linear equation, it can be solved if we get $a>0$ and $b=\\frac{2}{9}.$\nFor $f(3)$, use $a>0$ and $b=\\frac{2}{9}$:\n$$27a-\\frac{18}{9}+8=27a+2+8=\\boxed{37}.$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 37. I hope it is correct.\u00a0\u00a0Because there are so many possible choices for $a$ and $b$, finding $a$ and $b$ explicitly is difficult so we use less restrictive methods for now.\nHow can we get from $f(-3)=2$ and $f(3)=f(6-3)=a(6)^4-b(6)^2+6+5$ to $f(3)=8$?\n_(This method seems less desirable to me since we have additional variables.)\u00a0\u00a0Some of these variables are beyond the scope of the regular calculus course, so we might have more variables.",
        " We will solve this problem using known sequences\nFirst, we are told that $$f(-3) = 2.$$ We need to substitute -3 into the function $f(x)=ax^4 -bx^2 + x + 5$. To do this, we get that\n$$f(-3) = a(-3)^4 -b(-3)^2 + (-3) + 5 = 81a + 9b -3 + 5 = 86a + 9b - 3.$$Since $f(-3) = 2$, we have $86a + 9b = 5$, which gives us an equation with two variables.\nNow that we have an equation with two variables, we also have information about $f(3)$. Since $f$ is an even function, $f(3) = f(-3)$, so $f(3) = 2$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2. I hope it is correct. Then $$ax^4-bx^2+x+5=f(-3)=2,$$ $$a(3)^4-b(3)^2+3+5=f(3)=$$ but it seems to be wrong. Please let me know where I am wrong.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2. I hope it is correct.
