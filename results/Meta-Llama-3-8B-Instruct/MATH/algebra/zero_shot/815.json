Let\u2019s solve $x + y = 3$; by substituting $x = 7/2$ into this equation, we find $y = 3 - (7/2) = 1/2$. Therefore, we have $x = 7/2$ and $y = 1/2$. Next,\nyou can write $2x^2 + 2y^2$.

Solution Explanation: With the given system of equations, $x+y=3$ and $x-y=4$, we can solve for $x$ and $y$. Adding the equations, we have: $x+y + x-y = 3+4$ $\\Rightarrow$ $2x=7$ $\\Rightarrow$ $x=\\frac{7}{2}$ And, subtracting the equations: $x+y - x+y = 3-4$ $\\Rightarrow$ $2y=-1$ $\\Rightarrow$ $y=-\\frac{1}{2}$ This gives us two variables, $x$ and $y$, that satisfy both of the given equations.

Need assistance with your complex analysis question? I\u2019m here to help. Please provide more context so I can better understand your question. For now, we can re-write $x + y = 3$ and $x - y = 4$ in the form $x = a$ and $y = b$ respectively, where $a$ and $b$ are some real numbers. From here we can find $x^2 + y^2 = (x + y)(x - y) + 2xy = 4xy - 1 = 7 \\times 4 + 2xy - 1 = ",
        " \nFirst of all we solve a system of linear equation and get the value of $x$ and $y$.\nThe given equation are $x+y=3$ and $x-y=4$, if we solve this system we get the value of $x$:\nThe first equation is: $x+y=3$ $\\ldots$ (1) The second equation is: $x-y=4$ $\\ldots$ (2) If we add both equations we get the value of $x$.\nAdding equations (1) and (2) We get: $(x+y)+(x-y)=3+4$ $2x=7$ $x=7/2$\nLooking at equation (1), then we can find the value of $y$: $x+y=3$ $\\ldots$ (1) $7/2+y=3$ $y=3-7/2$ $y=1/2$\nWe can now write $x$ and $y$ in terms of $x=7/2$ and $y=1/2$\n### "
