I hope it is correct.  So the final simplification to the terms in decreasing order of degree is $(\\boxed{12x^2+3x+9})$.\nI hope it is correct.  So the final simplification to the terms in decreasing order of degree is $(\\boxed{12x^2+3x+9})$.\nIt's important to note that we should always write the terms in decreasing order of degree.  Hence, 12x^2 comes first, followed by 3x, and then 9.  Putting 9 in front does not affect the degree of the expression.  In other words, 9 is a constant which does not increase or decrease the degree of the expression.  It is important to check the answer to ensure our final answer is in decreasing order of degree.\nOnce you have written the polynomial in decreasing order of degree, you can check your answer by looking at each term and making sure the degree of each is either increasing or decreasing.  For example, the degree of 12x^2 is 2, and the degree of 3x is 1, and the degree of 9 is 0 (because there is no x).  Since 2 is greater than 1 and 0, the polynomial is in decreasing order of degree.  This is the case for each term in the expression and this verifies the correctness of the final answer.  I hope that helps. Let me know, if you have any other questions.

        " We are asked to add the two polynomials $9x^2+3x+7$ and $3x^2+7x^5+2$.\nWe can first group like terms. For example, we need to group $9x^2$ and $3x^2$ together, since both terms have the same degree. However, note that this means we will have one term with degree five in the sum, $7x^5$, and we don\u2019t need to group it with any other terms.

        " The problem asks us to combine like terms to obtain a simplified expression. To do this, we need to combine the like terms. Let\u2019s break it down and combine terms by degree.\nThe given expression is\n$(9x^2+3x+7)+(3x^2+7x^5+2)$.\nFirst, we can combine the term with the highest degree, which are $x^5$ terms. In this case, we have none. So, we move on.\nNext, we can combine the terms with degree 2, which are $x^2$ terms. We have $9x^2+3x^2$ which can be combined to get $12x^2$.\nThen, we can combine the terms with degree 1, which are $x$ terms. We have $3x+7x$ which can be combined to get $10x$.\nFinally, we can combine the constant terms. We have $7+2$ which can be combined to get $9$.\nSo, combining everything, we get the following polynomial:\n$12x^2+10x+9$\nThis is the simplified expression. I hope it is correct!

But $x^5$ does not have any combination with any other term, so it stays the same. Thus, the final answer is $\\boxed{12x^2+7x^5+7x+9}$.
