Then, the revenue functionP$ is described by\n### $$F(P)=500P+50$$ The graph of the revenue function (see Figure) indicates that while a decrease in price might increase the revenue in some range, a decrease beyond a certain point would reduce the revenue. To find the maximum point, we can use the method of the first derivative.\n### $$\\dfrac{dF}{dP} = 500 - \\frac{100}{P}$$\n### $$\\dfrac{100}{P} = 500$$\n### $$P = 10$$\n### $$F(10) = 5500$$\n### $$F'(P) = 0$$ whenP$ = 10.

Candela Approximation: One of the most important approximations in physics is the one made by the Italian scientist Amedeo Avogadro to estimate the number of molecules in a given quantity of a substance. The law of Avogadro states that at fixed temperature and pressure, equal volumes of different gases contain an equal number of molecules. According to Avogadro's law, the volume of one mole (6.022 x 10^23) of any gas is the same under the same conditions. Medications taken or substances consumed can also be used to check if substances are homogeneous and thus, if the same substances penetrate different parts of the body in equilibrium and have the same concentration and lastly if they are isotopic. Many crucial applications are based on the law of Avogadro because it states that simple particles collection of molecules",
        " Solution. Let$\\pi$ be the selling price of each smartphone. Then the revenue earned by the shop in a week is \\begin{align*} 450\\cdot500 & = 225000 \\end{align*} dollars. With the decrease in$\\$5$ from the selling price of $\\pi$, the shop sells 10 more smartphones per week, making the revenue now $$\\underbrace{ (450-5) }_{ \\pi - 5 } \\cdot (500 + 10) = 445\\cdot 510$$ dollars. Therefore, for each decrease of $\\$5$, the change in the revenue is \\begin{align*} 445\\cdot 510 - 450\\cdot500 & = (445-450)(510)-450\\cdot10 \\\\ & = -5\\cdot510-450\\cdot10 \\\\ & = -2550-4500 \\\\ & = -7050 \\\\ & = -70\\cdot 101 \\end{align*} dollars, which is negative. Thus, decreasing the price of smartphone would result in lower revenue. In other words, the optimal price of smartphone is$\\$450$.

Where do we get this formula from? And there is another way to solve this problem without using this formula?So, how we can make up for it? \u2013 HAL Nov 21 at 2:05\nHere's an intuitive explanation. The relationship between the price, revenue and the number of smartphones sold is given below. When the price of the smartphone increases, the revenue increases but the number of smartphones sold decreases. When the price is high, the less number of smartphones can be sold and hence the revenue is less. When the price is low, more smartphones can be sold and hence the revenue is more.\nWe have to simplify the problem. The first step is to decrease $\\$5$on each smartphone. This will result in an additional $10$ smartphones sold per week. Therefore, the total revenue after decreasing$\\$5$ on each smartphone is:\n$$r_1=(450-5) \\cdot 500 + 10 \\cdot 5 = 225000$$\nFor a price of $\\$50 each, the total revenue is$$r_2 = (445-10) \\cdot 510 = 225900.$$  The more revenue result is at$\\$45$ each, and the less revenue result is at $\\$55$ each.\nNotice that the total revenue is the sum of 2 parts: the revenue at the new price, and the revenue from the additional 10 smartphones sold. So,$$r_1 = (450-a) \\cdot 500 + 10 a ,$$  where $a$ is the decrease in price. We want to minimize $r_1$ and set it equal to $0$. Now we can solve the equation by using differentiation and algebra to find the price \\$a$ at maximum revenue.    $(450",

        " Suppose that after decreasing the price, they sell $f$ more smartphones at $\\$450 - 5 = \\ 445$ each. Then, the revenue would increase by $(f)(445) = 445f$ dollars.

        " The goal is to maximize revenue, so we first convert the weekly sale to a total weekly revenue.  We can write $$\\text{weekly revenue} = (450)(500)=225000\\text{ USD}.$$ Zeroing in on the 450, we see that it holds the key to maximizing the weekly revenue.\nIf we decrease the price of the smartphone by$5$, we increase the weekly sale to $$500+10=510\\text{ smartphones}.$$The new weekly revenue becomes$$\\text{weekly revenue} = (450-5)(510+10)=235650\\text{ USD}.$$In this case, the weekly revenue actually decreases.\nWe continue with such methods, decreasing the price by$5$and then increasing the sale by$10, repeatedly calculating the weekly revenue.  If we do so until there is no improvement, we find that \\begin{align*}\n\\text{weekly revenue} &=(440)(500)=220000\\text{ USD},\\\\\n\\text{weekly revenue} &=(435)(510)=221110\\text{ USD},\\\\\n\\text{weekly revenue} &=(430)(520)=223600\\text{ USD},\\\\\n\\text{weekly revenue} &=(425)(530)=224750\\text{ USD},\\\\\n\\text{weekly revenue} &=(420)(540)=226400\\text{ USD},\\\\\n\\text{weekly revenue} &=(415)(550)=228325\\text{ USD},\\\\\n\\text{weekly revenue} &=(410)(560)=229600\\text{ USD},\\\\\n\\text{weekly revenue} &=(405)(570)(=230975\\text{ USD},\\\\\n\\text{weekly revenue} &=(400)(580)=232600\\text{ USD},\\\\\n\\text{weekly revenue} &=(395)(590)=234425\\text{ USD},\\\\\n\\text{weekly revenue} &=(390)(600)=236000\\text{ USD},\\\\\n\\text{weekly revenue} &=(385)(610)=237725\\text{ USD}.\\\\\n\\end{align*}\nIt appears that we are maximizing the weekly revenue. The additional 10 smartphones increase does not lead to a higher weekly revenue at this point. So, the weekly revenue at this maximum value is $\\boxed{237725}$ USD. Hence, the optimal price that the shop should sell its smartphone at is$\\$385$ each. \nFinal Answer",
        " $425$.\nAs a function, we can denote the price of the smartphone as$f$and the weekly revenue as$R$.  Let$f(x)$ be the revenue at the price$\\$x$.  Then, $f(x) = 500x$.  However, for every$\\$5$ decrease in price, there is an increase of $10$ sales to $10 \\cdot 500 = 5000$ and a weekly revenue of $5005x$.  This means we have two different levels of revenue, $f_1(x) = 500x$ and $f_2(x) = 5005x$.  Now, we want to figure out where the maximum revenue is.\nGiven that eventually, increasing or decreasing price does not affect the revenue at all.  The easiest way to solve this problem is to find where the maximum revenue is.  For every $\\$5$decrease in price, we increase the revenue by$\\$45$.  As long as the net revenue at a different price is greater than the revenue at the original price, we keep decreasing the price.  However, once the net revenue is less than at the original price, there is no longer a net benefit, so let us find where that occurs.\nThe revenue is given by \\\\[5mm]\nR(x) = f_1(x) when 0.2x\\le 60\\\\\nR(x) = f_2(x) when 0.2x > 60.\n\\\\\nThis means if we have the maximum revenue at a price less than or equal to$\\$450$, we would have revenue$R_1(x)$.  If the maximum revenue is at a price greater than$\\$450$, the price is$R_2(x)$.  From the inequality, we know that if we start at$\\$450$, then increasing the price will result in a lower revenue.  Therefore, the maximum revenue at a price greater than $\\$450$ is$R_1(x)$.  In other words, we note that the maximum revenue is$R_1(x)$.  Since the price of$\\$450$ corresponds to$R_1$, this is the maximum revenue.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 425.

Let's chat!endid May 2, 2020 Thanks for checking in! I'm glad to share that setting up the logistic model was pretty straightforward. I applied the first derivative test and found that the price of$500 would result in the maximum revenue. However, I also noticed that since the price decrease is discrete, it's not a continuous function. How should I have handled that in this problem? Would you like to share any additional insights or tips?\nThank you!\nCasey May 3, 2020 That's a great point, Casey! Discrete changes in price can indeed complicate the analysis.\nIn this specific problem, the fact that the price change is discrete doesn't affect the result significantly. This is because the data suggests that the price decrease has a linear effect on the number of smartphones sold. Therefore, the discontinuity in the price change won't have a major impact on the maximum revenue.\nHowever, in general, when dealing with discrete changes in a function, it's essential to consider the problem's context and any subtleties in the data. For instance, you might need to think about the possibility of discontinuous jumps in the function's behavior or non-continuous gradients.\nTo handle discrete changes in price, you could try to model them as approximations of continuous functions. For example, you might assume a piece",

Then, let$n$be the number of times the price is decreased by$\\$5$, which is $\\frac{450-5n}{5}.$  Then, $P$ is equal to $(450)(500)+(5)\\sum (450-5n)(10)$\n\\begin{align*}\nP&=(450)(500)+(5)\\sum (450-5n)(10)\\\\\n&=225000+(5)\\sum (4500-50n)\\\\\n&=225000+(5)(4500) + (5)\\sum -50n\\\\\n&=225000+22500-50\\sum n\\\\\n&=247500-50\\sum n.\n\\end{align*}  Now, let\u2019s consider$\\sum n$.  If $n=0$, then $y=500$ and $P=225000$.  If $n=20$, then $y=1000$ and $P=195000$.  This can be done for various other values of $n$.  In general, we have $(\\forall n\\le21,~ y=(500+10n)),$  Thus, $P=247500-50\\sum n=247500-50(10\\frac{n(n+1)}{2})=247500-50\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}.$  Thus, $P$ is maximized when the denominator of the fraction is zero; in other words, when $n=0$.  Thus, we should not change the price.  Since $n=0$, $X=0$, so the original price of$\\$450$ per smartphone is the price that results in maximum revenue.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 450.

        " If the shop sells the smartphone at $\\$450,$ it earns 500 x 450 = 225000 dollars a week. Now if the shop reduces its price by$\\$5$, it will increase the sale by 10.  If the price is reduced to $\\$445$, it will sell 510 phones a week now. The revenue now becomes 510 x 445 = 227550. If it reduces the price by another$\\$5$, it will earn revenue from 520 phones and the revenue is 520 x 440 = 228800.  If it reduces the price by another \\$5, it will earn revenue from 530 phones and the revenue is 530 x 435 = 229915. We can continue this process. Each time the price is lowered, more phones are sold but the profit per phone will decrease. However, at first glance, this looks like the highest revenue. This may be due to the instinct to reduce price when revenue drops.\nNow let\u2019s think in terms of the rate of change of revenue.  At any time, the rate of change of revenue with respect to the price is 10 - \\frac{500000}{p+5}. We want to find the price at which the revenue is maximum.\nSuppose the rate of change is zero. Then 10 - \\frac{500000}{p+5} = 0 But 10 = \\frac{500000}{p+5}.\nNow 500000 = 10(p+5). So p+5 = 50000.  So p = 49500.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\$495. I hope it is correct. Discuss below.

        " Keep $p$ for the price of the phone. The revenue in dollars is given by $R(p)=450\\cdot500=225000$ now. If the price goes down by $\\$5$, the number of phones goes up by $10$, so let\u2019s find out when the revenue is maximum. In order to have that, we have to analyze the maxima of$\\Delta R(p) = R\u2018(p)$. Since $R(p) = 450\\cdot500$ and it is a constant, $R\u2018(p) = 0$. Once you find the maximum, the price of the phone is going down. I have attached a graph to better illustrate the idea. The red curve is$R(p)$and the blue one is$\\Delta R(p)$.\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\np = np.linspace(445,455,100)\nR = 450 * 500\ndR = R * np.gradient(np.heaviside(p-445,1))\nplt.plot(p,R,label='R(p)') \nplt.plot(p,dR,label='\\Delta R(p)')\nplt.grid(True)\nplt.xlabel('Price')\nplt.ylabel('Revenue')\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n```\nWe can do it now to have the optimal price.\n### Complete Solution:\nLet\u2019s do a calculation\n    $$R\u2018(p)=500\\cdot(-5)+10$$\nNow we need to find the maximum and this is the last step. To do this, you can do the following\n    $$500\\cdot(-5)+10=0\\Rightarrow p=\\frac{10}{5}=2$$\nThen the price of$\\$5\\$\u201d.\nHence, the optimal price is $\\boxed{\\$445}$. The optimal number of smartphones sold each week at this price is 510. The maximum revenue is \\$$225,900\". I hope it will help you. Please let me know if you have any questions.

        " Final Answer: The final answer is 425. I hope it is correct. First of all, let the total revenue of the smartphones be $R$ dollars, and the total number of smartphones be $n$. Then we have: $R=450n$. Also, if the price of the smartphone is decreased by $\\$5$, then we have $n' = n+10$ and $R' = 445 (n+10)$. Now we find the critical point of this equation to determine the maximum revenue. To do this, we first set the derivative equal to 0: $$\\frac{R'}{d} = 445 = 0 \\quad $$ We can solve this equation to find that $R'=4450$, or $R = 445n$ is the maximum revenue at $n = 500 - 50 = 450$.\nIn other words, we can find the maximum revenue at that number. We can also think of the problem in a more straightforward manner.\n### Analysis: If we think of the total revenue as $R(x)$, where $x$ is the price of the smartphone, we can write $R(x) = 450(500 - 10(x-450))$, because if the price of a smartphone is $\\$x$, then the total number of smartphones sold will be $500 - 10(x-450)$. Since we want to find the price that results in maximum revenue, we can calculate the value of $x$ at which the total revenue is the greatest. To find this value, we can calculate the critical point of the function $R(x)$, which is obtained when $\\frac{dR}{dx} = 0$. So we can say $R(x) = -10(500 - 10(x-450)) = 0$. Let\u2019s solve for $x$. We have $-10000(x-450) = 0$ Now to find the value of $x$, we can add $10,000$ to both sides to get\n$$10000x = 450000$$ Then we can solve for $x$ to get\n$$x = \\frac{450000}{10000} = \\boxed{45}.$$\nAt the critical point of $x = 45$, the total revenue is obtained from the following equation: $$R(x) = R(45) = 450(500 - 50(45-450))$$ Simplifying the expression, we get:$$R"
