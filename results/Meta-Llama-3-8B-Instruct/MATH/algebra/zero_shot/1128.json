We multiply through by $x$ to clear the fraction, then rearrange terms: $x^2 + x - 2 = 0$. This can be factored as $(x + 2)(x - 1) = 0$. We could also use the quadratic formula to find $x$: $$x = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1^2 - 4(1)(-2)}}{2}.$$ Either way, we find that $x = 1$ or $x = -2$.

This means we are looking at the following expression:\ntwo times the reciprocal of the number, minus 1.\nWe can write this more formally:\n$2 \\times \\frac{1}{n} - 1$.\nWe are looking for the smallest number we can have. We don\u2019t know what this number is yet, so we will call it $n$.\nWe can write the equation:\n$2 \\times \\frac{1}{n} - 1 = n - 1$.\nIt is a bit easier to solve if we add 1 to both sides:\n$2 \\times \\frac{1}{n} = n$.\nNow we have:\n$\\frac{2}{n} = n$.\nFrom here, we can multiply both sides by $n$. This way, the $n$ that is on the right side also goes to the left side:\n$2 = n^2$.\nThis means $n = \\sqrt{2}$, which is the smallest possible positive solution. Therefore, the smallest number which is one less than twice its reciprocal is $n = \\boxed{\\sqrt{2}}$.",
        " \nWhen we see a problem like this, it's often helpful to start with a small example. Let's try an example: Let $n$ be an integer such that $n=(1-n)^{-1}$, or, equivalently, $\\frac{1}{n}=1-n$. Then, since $1-n=\\frac{1}{n}$, we have $$n(1-n)=1.$$Expanding the LHS of this equation and rearranging, we have $$n^2-n-1=0.$$When we factor the quadratic, we obtain $$(n-1)(n+1)=0.$$We know that $n\\neq1$, since then we would have contradiction with the assumption that $n$ is an integer. Thus, $n+1=0$, or $\\boxed{n=-1}$. This is indeed the smallest integer that satisfies the equation. Alternative approach: we let $x$ be a number that satisfies $x=\\frac{2}{1-x}$, or $\\frac{x-1}{x+1}=1$. This can be manipulated into a quadratic: $x^2+x-1=0$. Factoring, we get that $(x+1)(x-1)=0$, which clearly only has integer solution $x=-1$, which we had already found.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -1. I hope it is correct.

        " \nThe problem is asking for a number which satisfies the relation $x=2(\\frac{1}{x})-1$. We can simplify this by multiplying both sides by $x$: \\begin{align*}\nx&=2(\\frac{1}{x})-1\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x^2&=2x-2\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x^2-2x+2&=0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad (x-1)^2&=0\n\\end{align*}The original equation becomes indeterminate when $x=1$. In this case, $x=2(\\frac{1}{x})-1$ becomes $1=2(\\frac{1}{1})-1\\Rightarrow\\boxed{1=1}$. In order to find a number which satisfies the original relation, we can set $x=1+a$, where $a$ is an infinitesimally small real number. Then the equation $x=2(\\frac{1}{x})-1$ becomes \\begin{align*}\n1+a&=2(\\frac{1}{1+a})-1\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad a&=2(\\frac{1}{1+a})-2\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad (a+1)a&=2-a\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad a^2+a-2&=0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad (a+2)(a-1)&=0\n\\end{align*}The equation becomes indeterminate when $a=1$, since we subtracted $1$ from both sides. Setting $a=1+b$ where $b$ is an infinitesimally small real number, we have \\begin{align*}\na^2+a-2&=0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad (1+b+2)(1+b-1)&=0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad (3+b)(b)&=0\n\\end{align*}The original equation is satisfied when $b=-3$ since the left hand side approaches zero. Therefore, the number which satisfies $x=2(\\frac{1}{x})-1$ is $x=1-a=1-(-3)=\\boxed{4}$.\n### Final Answer: The final answer is 4. I hope it is correct.  Let\u2019s think step by step.\nThe problem is asking for a number which",
        " Set up the equation: \\[\\frac{2}{x} = x - 1 \\]\n### Solution:\n\\[ 2x = (x-1) \\cdot x = x^2 - x \\]\\[ \\quad \\implies x^2 - x - 2 = 0 \\]\\[ \\quad \\implies (x-2)(x+1) = 0 \\]\\[\\quad \\implies x = -1, 2 \\]\nHowever, since the number cannot be negative, we choose $x = 2$.",

This gives: $2 = x^2 + x$.\n### Step 4: Factor the quadratic.\nFactoring the quadratic on the right-hand side, we get: $2 = x(x + 2)$.\n### Step 5: Solve for x.\nThis means we need to solve for x by setting each factor equal to 0 and finding the crossing points. Both factors can be 0 if x = 0, so let\u2019s check: $0 = 0$.\nWe can also find the crossing point by setting x equal to -2: $2 = (-2)(-2 + 2)$. This gives 2 = -4 which is false.\nTherefore, the smaller solution is the correct one: $x = 0$. This means the smallest number which is one less than twice its reciprocal is $\\boxed{0}$.",

        " \nTo start, let's let the number be x. Based on the phrase \"which is one less than twice its reciprocal,\" we can write an equation for x: $$2\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)-1.$$Now, let's simplify this expression: \\begin{align*}\n2\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)-1 &= \\frac{2}{x}-1 \\\\\n&= \\frac{2}{x}-\\frac{x}{x} \\\\\n&= \\frac{2-x}{x}\n\\end{align*}So, our equation for x becomes $$\\frac{2-x}{x}= x-1 .$$Next, we can cross-multiply to get rid of the fraction: $$2-x = x^2 - x .$$Our equation then becomes $$x^2 -x -2 = 0 .$$Let's factor it: $$(x-2)(x+1) = 0 .$$This means that either $x-2 = 0$, so $x = 2$, or $x+1 = 0$, which means that $x = -1$.
