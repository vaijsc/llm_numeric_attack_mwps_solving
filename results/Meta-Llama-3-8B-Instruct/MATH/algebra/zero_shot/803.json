For this system, let\u2019s use substitution. Let x be the greater number and y be the smaller number.

        " \nLet the two consecutive odd numbers be n and n + 2, where n is an odd number. Then, we know that (n)(n + 2) = 255.\nNotice that any odd number is one more or one less than an integer multiple of 2, i.e., it has the form 2k - 1 or 2k + 1.  Then, we can rewrite n as 2k - 1 for some integer k.  It follows that n + 2 = 2k + 1, so:\n(2k - 1)(2k + 1) = 255\nExpanding, we have\n2k^2 - 1 = 255\nTogether with 2k^2, the left side can be factored as (2k + 17)(k - 15).  So, we have\n(2k + 17)(k - 15) = 255\nSince the product of two consecutive odd numbers is 255, we know that the factors of 255 must contain at least one even factor.  Inspection of the prime factorization of 255 yields 3 * 5 * 17, none of which is even.  Therefore, k - 15 must be equal to 3 or -5.  However, we cannot have k - 15 = -5 because this implies n would be negative.\nThis leads to k = 15, so n = 2k - 1 = 30 - 1 = 29 and n + 2 = 2k + 1 = 30 + 1 = 31.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 31.

        " The product of two consecutive odd whole numbers is 255. What is the greater number?\nThe first step is to start by determining the smallest pair of consecutive odd whole numbers. These numbers are 1 and 3 since they are consecutive odd numbers.\nSo, we have: 3*1=3\nThe next step is to check if this pair works for the given product. Since the product is 255, we need to multiply these numbers together to see. 3*1=3, which is not the correct product.\nThis means that 1 and 3 are not the correct pair. Since 1 and 3 don\u2019t work, we need to try another pair of consecutive odd numbers.\nLet\u2019s try 3 and 5. If we multiply these numbers together, we get: 3*5=15\nAgain, this is not the correct product since it is smaller than the desired product. We need to try another pair of consecutive odd numbers.\nLet\u2019s try 5 and 7. If we multiply these numbers together, we get: 5*7=35\nThis number is still too small. We need to try another pair of consecutive odd numbers.\nLet\u2019s try 7 and 9. If we multiply these numbers together, we get: 7*9=63\nThis number is too small as well. We need to try another pair of consecutive odd numbers.\nLet\u2019s try 9 and 11. If we multiply these numbers together, we get: 9*11=99\nThis number is bigger than the desired product. We don\u2019t need to continue to find larger numbers. We can stop here because we already know that 9*11=99 is too big.\nBut wait! We were looking for consecutive odd numbers. We forgot to check 11 and 13. If we multiply these numbers together, we get: 11*13=143\nThis number is still too small. We need to try another pair of consecutive odd numbers.\nLet\u2019s try 13 and 15. If we multiply these numbers together, we get: 13*15=195\nThis number is still too small. We need to try another pair of consecutive odd numbers.\nLet\u2019s try 15 and 17. If we multiply these numbers together, we get: 15*17=255\nBingo! We finally found the correct pair of consecutive odd numbers. The greater number is 17.",
        " 17\nLet the two consecutive odd numbers be $2n+1$ and $2n+3$. Since they are consecutive, we have\n$$2n+1 < 2n+3.$$To find the product of these two numbers, we can multiply them together:\n$$(2n+1)(2n+3) = 4n^2 + 8n + 3.$$We know that the product of these two numbers is $255$, so we can set them equal to each other:\n\\begin{align*}\n4n^2 + 8n + 3 &= 255 \\\\\n4n^2 + 8n + 2 &= 0 \\\\\nn^2 + 2n + 1 &= 0\n\\end{align*}\nNow we can factor this equation:\n$$\\boxed{(n+1)(n+1)=0}.$$This implies that either $n+1=0$, which is impossible, or $n+1=1$. Therefore, $n=0$, and our odd numbers are 1 and 3. However, the question states that we are looking for consecutive odd numbers, which means we need to look at the next odd numbers as well, namely 3 and 5. We will test all numbers, but we can stop after trying $n=8$, since any larger $n$ will have a product that is too large. Therefore, our numbers are $2n+1=17$ and $2n+3=19$, so the greater number is $\\boxed{19}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 19. I hope it is correct. You can also solve the problem with the formulas of the sum of an arithmetic sequence. Those formulas are average = val (total), and total = n x val (average). The sum of an arithmetic sequence is an arithmetic series. The arithmetic series is expressed as follows: average value = number of times (sum). The distribution is the distance of the frequencies in an arithmetic sequence. The average is found when we convert the arithmetic series to an arithmetic regression. The arithmetic regression is converted to a number showing the strength of the trend over time. Once the average is calculated, it can be added to the arithmetic series. You can also know the number of elements for an arithmetic sequence. Total means all the elements. With this formula, we can find the total of all elements in the sequence. - Mariana Morais Let\u2019s call the two consecutive odd",

We can set up an equation where we need to find the two consecutive odd whole numbers. Let the smaller number be x, and the larger number be x + 2. Because both numbers are odd, we can write the equation as x \u00d7 (x + 2) = 255. We can solve this equation by factoring. The factors of 255 are 3, 5, and 17. So, we can write the equation as (3 \u00d7 x) \u00d7 (5 \u00d7 (x + 2)) = 255. We can then find the values of x that satisfy this equation. After solving for x, we get x = 5.
