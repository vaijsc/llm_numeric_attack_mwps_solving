We know that the exponentiation of a power is equal to the exponent raised to the power:\n$$(2^3)^{(2^3)} = 2^{3 \\times 2^3}$$To simplify that, we can combine the two exponents. We know that a product of exponents is their sum:\n$$2^{3 \\times 2^3} = 2^{3+2^3}$$The sum of the exponents will be equal to $N$. $3 + 2^3 = 3 + 8 = 11$. So, the value of $N$ is $11$.\nActually, the value is not $11$. We must convert the sum to the same power. \n$$2^{3+2^3} = 2^3 \\times 2^{2^3}$$ Use the rule for multiplying like bases: $$a^m \\times a^n = a^{m+n}$$ Therefore, $$2^{3+2^3} = 2^{3+8} = 2^{11}$$\nTo get $N$ in a single power, we must express the whole expression as a power of $2$. \n$$2^{3+8} = 2^{3} \\times 2^8 = 2^{3+8} = 2^{11}$$\nAs $2^{3} = 8$, the value of $N$ is $3+8=2187$. \n### Key Concept:\nWhen you encounter expressions with multiple exponents, you can combine them using the rule for multiplying like bases: $$a^m \\times a^n = a^{m+n}$$ This helps simplify the expression and convert the sum of exponents to a single power.

Final Answer: The final answer is 24. I hope it is correct.  Final Answer: The final answer is 24. I hope it is correct. I think the two approaches both get across the same idea, in different ways.  If an equation says 2^(3*2^3), we can think of it as if we're executing 3 orders on a calculator, where each order raises a number to some power.  In that case, we would have calculator-raises-2-to-the-8-cubed. It's also easy to see that 2^(8*3) is equivalent to many versions of one order: 2 to the 8, 3 times. The two expressions will give the same result, no matter what 2^3 will give you. It just depends on how you denote that 2 cubed thing.  Final Answer: The final answer is 24. I hope it is correct.

        " Let's solve the problem step by step.\nSwapping the exponents of $(2^3)^{(2^3)}$ will give us $2^{(2^3 \\cdot 3)}$.\n$2^3 = 8$, so $2^3 \\cdot 3 = 24$.\n$2^{24} = 2^N$.\nTherefore, $N$ is equal to $\\boxed{24}$.\nThis will be the answer.

Please let me know if\u00a0you have any other questions.\nThere is also an alternate solution:\n\u2022 That gives us $2^{54} = 2^N$.\n\u2022 $54$ will be the value of $N$.\n\u2022 Therefore, the result will be $\\boxed{54}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 24. I hope it is correct.\nIt is another way to get the same solution. We will use the same logic and steps to get to the same answer. The question is requesting us to find out what is the value of N in $2^N$. This problem can be rewritten as  Cuba 3 to the power of 2 cubed. It is written as 2 to the power of (2 to the power of 3). This is equivalent to 2 power to power 2 to the power of 3 and 3.\nThis means $2^N$ = $(2^3)^{(2^3)}$.\nWe are going to simplify the left side. If we multiply the two exponents together, we get 24.\n$2^{24}$ simplified from $(2^3)^{(2^3)}$.\n2 to the power of N is equal to $2^{24}$. If we equate these, we get $2^N = 2^{24}$. We need to solve for N.\nThe only way for the two expressions $2^N$ and $2^{24}$ to be equal is if N is equal to $24$. And therefore, $24$ is the value of $N$. I hope it is clear.

I hope it is correct.  ####  Eva Lother 2022-01-13 23:42:51 If we assume that 2^3 = a, then we have a^(2^3) = 2^N. Taking the logarithm of both sides, we have (2^3) * log(a) = log(2^N). Simplifying, we have 6 * log(a) = log(2^N). Now, we can rewrite log(2^N) as N * log(2) = N * . This makes our expression look like 6 * log(a) = N. Solving this equation for N, we have N = 6 * log(a). But log(a) = 3, so N = 6 * 3. N is equal to 18.  ####  Danny Quah 2022-01-13 23:47:08 Yes, we can simplify the expression a^(2^3) = 2^N and solve for N. However, my solution takes a slightly different approach. Alternatively, we can use De Morgan's law to evaluate the expression. Since 2^(2^3) is equal to 2^(8) and N is equal to 24, we can conclude that N is equal to 24.  ####  Ana Garces 2022-01-13 23:50:48 Great answers from both of you! I will review and try to remember another approach, although I think Eva's solution is a great one. Mathematically, we can express it as follows: a^(2^3) = 2^N. With the assumption that a = 2^3, we can rewrite the expression as: (2^3)^(2^3) = 2^N. This is identical to (2^(2*3))^3 = 2^N or (2",

        " N = 3\u22c53 + 3 = 12\nApply the \u201corder of operations\u201d $(MK)^p$ means we multiply by itself $p$ times and $M^p$ means $M$ is raised to the $p$ power, where $M$ is the base, and $K$ is the exponent. So, $(2^3)^{(2^3)}$ is equivalent to $2^{3\u22c52^3}$, using the laws of exponents. But wait, we can also express $2^{3\u22c52^3}$ as $(2^3)^3$, or 2^9 using the fact that 3\u22c52^3=3\u22c58=24=2^2\u22c512=2^2\u22c52\u22c56=2^2\u22c52\u22c52\u22c53=2^3\u22c53=8\u22c53=2^3\u22c52\u22c52\u22c51.5=2^9.
