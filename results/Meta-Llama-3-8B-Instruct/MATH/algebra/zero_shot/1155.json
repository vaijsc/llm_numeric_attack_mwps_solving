So, we can re-write this question as $$\\lceil y\\rceil+y=15.5$$\n$$\\Rightarrow\\quad y+\\lceil y\\rceil=15.5$$\nSince we want to find a number, we can let $y$ be the decimal part of a number. So we can say that $y = 8.5$. So $\\lceil y\\rceil = 9$. But in the question, $y+\\lceil y\\rceil = 15.5$, so we can get $8.5 + 8 = 16.5$ but we know it\u2019s too much. So, we have to find a number $y$ that is less than $8.5$ but the ceiling function will map it to $8$ as $9$ is not needed. Therefore, $y=8$.\nTherefore, we have the answer of $y=8$. Because we know the ceiling function will map 8 to 8 and then $8+8$ will give $16$.\n### What are the key points in your solution? Key points are \\begin{itemize} \\item Rewrite the question as $y+\\lceil y\\rceil=15.5$ \\item Let y be the decimal part of the number. Let y = 8.5. Then \\lceil y\\rceil = 9 \\item Check if y = 8.5 is valid or not. It's not. So we have to find another number that is less than 8.5 but the ceiling function will map it to 8. \\item that number is y = 8. Then \\lceil y\\rceil = 8 and y + \\lceil y\\rceil = 8+8",
        " \nNote that $\\lceil y\\rceil = y + r$, where $r$ is a number between 0 and 1.\nHence,\n$y + r + y = 15.5 \\implies 2y + r = 15.5$ \n$y = 7.25 + 0.5r$.\nWe see that $y$ can only take the values $7$ and $8$.\n$7.25 + 0.5r = 7 \\implies r = 0.25$.\n$7.25 + 0.5r = 8 \\implies r = 0.75$.\nBut note that $r = 0.25 \\implies \\lceil y\\rceil = 7$ which does not satisfy $2y + r = 15.5$.\n$r = 0.75 \\implies \\lceil y \\rceil = 8$ which does satisfy $2y + r = 15.5$.\nHence $y = 8$ and $\\lceil y\\rceil = 8$.",
        " \nFor $\\lceil y\\rceil+y=15.5$, we can substitute $y=x+c$ with $0\\le x<1$, if $c$ is a real number. Then we have $\\lceil x+c\\rceil+c=15.5$, which can be written as\n\\begin{align*}\nc+x+1&=15.5 \\text{ if $1\\le c+x<2$} \\\\\nc+x &=15.5 \\text{ if $0\\le c+x<1$}.\n\\end{align*}Using this two conditions, we finally get \\begin{align*}\nc = 15.5 - 1 = 14.5 & \\text{ if $1\\le x<1$} \\\\ c &= 15.5 - x \\text{ if $0\\le x<1$}.\n\\end{align*}Based on this information, it is easy to find the only integer $x$, namely, $x=1$, and $y=15.5 - 1 = \\boxed{14.5}$. Yay.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 14.5. I hope it is correct.",
        " \nLet $y=n+\\epsilon$, where $\\epsilon$ is the fractional part of $y$. Then, $\\lceil y\\rceil+y=15.5$ can be rewritten as $\\lceil n+\\epsilon\\rceil+n+\\epsilon=15.5$ or $n+\\lceil \\epsilon\\rceil+n+\\epsilon=15.5$. This implies that $\\lceil \\epsilon \\rceil=\\epsilon$ because the fractional part of $y$ has to be less than $1$.\n### ",
        " Step by step\nGiven $\\lceil y \\rceil + y = 15.5$ ... question asks us to find the value of $y$\nFrom the definition of ceiling function $\\lceil y \\rceil$ means the smallest integer greater than or equal to $y$... means the number of $y$ is already integer or...one less than the number $y$.\nSo, let $x = \\lceil y \\rceil$, than $x$ is integer.\nThen the equation is $x + y = 15.5$\n$y$ is between 0 and $1$ because $y$ is not an integer and $x = \\lceil y \\rceil , y > 0$.\nLet $y = b$...\nThe equation is $x + b = 15.5$\n$0 < b < 1$.\nLet\u2019s plug in some values:\nIf $b = 0.4$...\n$x = 15.5 - 0.4 = 15.1$\nBut we cant have the decimal number...\nSo, $b = 0.1$...\n$x = 15.5 - 0.1 = 15.4$\nNow, we can see that $x$ is integer... $x = 15$...\nNow we have the final answer $x + b = 15.5$\n$15 + 0.5 = 15.5$",

        " \nLet\u2019s set up an equation:\n\\lceil y\\rceil+y=15.5.\nSince we are working with ceilings, we can first move the y to the other side of the equation, giving\n\\lceil y\\rceil=15.5-y.\nWe can find the integer part of $y$ by subtracting 0.5. That is,\ny=2.\n### Final Answer: The final answer is 2. I hope it is correct.### Final Answer: The final answer is 2. I hope it is correct.###Final Answer: The final answer is 2. I hope it is correct. I hope it is correct. WRONG THIS IS THE WRONG ANSWER WE HAVE NOT YET USED THE FLOOR/CEILING FUNCTION IN OUR WORK\nLet\u2019s think step by step.\nThis problem looks tricky because we are starting with $\\lceil y \\rceil + y$.  That\u2019s not an easy expression to manipulate.  If we subtract $y$ from both sides of the equation, we can make it easier.  $\\boxed{15.5 - y = \\lceil y \\rceil}$.\nNow we have to pay close attention to what happens when $y$ is a decimal.  For instance, when $y = 3.5$, $\\lceil y \\rceil = 4$.  This tells us that if $y$ is between an integer and a half, its ceiling will be that integer.  On the other hand, if $y$ is between an integer and an integer plus half, the integer will be the ceiling.\nLet\u2019s try to test the values of $y$ in our problem.  When $y = 14.5$, $\\lceil y \\rceil = 15$ and $15.5 - y = 1.0$.  When $y = 12.5$, $\\lceil y \\rceil = 13$ and $15.5 - y = 3.0$.  When $y = 15$, $\\lceil y \\rceil = 15$ and $15.5 - y = 0.5$.  Now, all three tests have the same ceiling.  That means we can set these two expressions equal in our equation, $15.5 - y = \\lceil y \\rceil$, and we have an equation with just one variable.  By doing this, we are essentially testing every possible value of $y$ with the",
        " \nWe know that $\\lceil y\\rceil$ is an integer.  We also know that $y+15.5=15.5+\\lceil y\\rceil$.  So $y$ is halfway between two integers.  The only integer that works is $y=7.5$.\n### Solution:\nLet $y$ be the value such that $\\lceil y\\rceil+y=15.5$.  Notice that $\\lceil y\\rceil$ is an integer, as it is the ceiling of a real number.  Therefore, the equation becomes $y+\\lceil y\\rceil=15.5$.  We know $y$ and $\\lceil y\\rceil$ are both real numbers, and their sum is the rational number 15.5.  The only way this can happen is if one number is 7.5 and the other is 8 (since $\\lceil 7.5\\rceil = 8$).  This means the equation becomes $y+8=15.5\\Rightarrow \\boxed{y=7.5}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 7.5.
