Here's an explanation of the solution: 1. $f(x) = x + 2$ So when you substitute x into f(x) , you get a new value of x + 2. 2. $f(g(x)) = ?$ = $f(x^2) = ?$ $x^2+2$ 3. $x^2+2$ = f(x) So , $f(g(x)) = f(x^2) = x^2 + 2$ 4.$world= at\u00e9 plura-comprove=Coloramar Cass 5.# f(x) = x + 2 $Then when you substitute x into g(x) , you get a new value of X squared. 6. $g(f(x)) = ?$ = $g(x+2) = ?$ $(x+2)^2$ 7. $(x+2)^2 = g(x)$  So , $g(f(x)) = (x+2)^2$ Now we go through the correct procedure 8. $f(g(x)) = g(f(x))$ He means that ( x^2+2) $= (x+2)^2$ 9. x^2+2 = x^2+4x+4 10.(x^2+2) = (x^2+4x+4) We want to simplify everything by eliminating ( x + 2 ) So 12. Simplify x^2 to x^2 and 4x to 4x So we get 13. 2 = 4x 14. 1/2 = x 15. Finally answer = Final Answer: The final answer is 23/5. I hope you are satisfied with the explanation.

        " First of all, let us start by calculating $f(g(x))$. This is simply $f(x^2)$, which is equivalent to $x^2+2$. Likewise, we can calculate $g(f(x))$ as follows. This is equal to $g(x+2)$, which simplifies to $(x+2)^2$.\n### Conclusion: Therefore, we have the following for both $f(g(x))$ and $g(f(x))$. $$f(g(x)) = x^2+2,\\quad g(f(x)) = x^2+4x+4.$$\n### Conclusion: Now we can derive the equation that $f(g(x)) = g(f(x))$.
