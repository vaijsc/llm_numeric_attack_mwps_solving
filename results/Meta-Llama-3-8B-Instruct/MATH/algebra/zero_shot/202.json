        " We need to figure out which values of $x$ make the expression undefined. If the denominator $x^2 \u2013 9$ is equals to zero, it will make the expression undefined. So, we need to find the solution of $x^2 \u2013 9 = 0.$We can do this by adding $9$ and $9$ to both side of the equation.\nSo, $x^2 \u2013 9 + 9 = 9$\nIt becomes: $x^2 = 9$\nWe can solve this equation. Since $x^2 \\ge 0$ for all $x$, $x^2 = 9$ only when $x = \\pm3.$Therefore, $x = 3$ or $x = -3$ make the expression undefined and there are $\\boxed{2}$ such values. So the answer is 2.\n## UPDATE\nFor the convenience, we will share with the Step-by-step solutions PDF.",
