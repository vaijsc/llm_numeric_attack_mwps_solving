I hope it is correct. 9+2f(-2)=9+2[(-2)^2-3]=9+2[4-3]=9+2=11. I hope it is correct.\n### Explanation: \nWe know $t(x) = 9+2f(x)$, and also $f(x) = x^2-3$, so we plug in $x = -2$.\n\\begin{align*}\nt(f(-2))&=9+2f(-2)\\\\\n&=9+2[-2]^2-6\\\\\n&=9+2[4-3]\\\\\n&=9+2\\\\\n&=\\boxed{11}\n\\end{align*}\nThis is a simple substitution problem. We plug in the value of $f(-2)$ into the equation $t(x) = 9+2f(x)$ and solve. To find $f(-2)$, we plug in $x = -2$ into the equation $f(x) = x^2-3$. This gives us $f(-2) = (-2)^2-3 = 4-3 = 1$.
