A line with a slope \u2018m\u2019 that passes through the points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) has the equation y \u2013 y1 = m(x \u2013 x1).\nThe slope of the line \u2018m\u2019 is given by $\\frac{y2 \u2013 y1}{x2 \u2013 x1}$ .\nSo, we can find the slope of the line passing through the points (-3,1) and (2,-1).\n$\\frac{y2 \u2013 y1}{x2 \u2013 x1} = \\frac{-1 \u2013 1}{2 \u2013 (-3)} = \\frac{-2}{5}$ $\\Rightarrow m = \\frac{-2}{5}$ $\\Rightarrow y \u2013 y1 = \\frac{-2}{5}\\left( x \u2013 x1 \\right)$\nSubstituting the points (-3,1) and (2,-1) in the line equation, we get $\\left( y \u2013 1 \\right) = \\frac{-2}{5}\\left( x + 3 \\right)$ $\\left( y \u2013 1 \\right) = \\frac{-2}{5}x \u2013 \\frac{6}{5}$ $y = \\frac{-2}{5}x + 1 - \\frac{6}{5}$ $y = \\frac{-2}{5}x \u2013 \\frac{6}{5} + 1 \u2013 1$ $y = \\frac{-2}{5}x \u2013 1.2$\nThe equation of the line passing through the points (-3,1) and (2,-1) is y = (-2/5)x \u2013 1.2.\nFinal Answer",

Notice that $\\frac{\\sqrt{2x} \\sqrt{3x-1}}{3x-1}=\\frac{\\sqrt{(2x)(3x-1)}}{3x-1}=\\frac{\\sqrt{6x^2-x}}{3x-1}$. This will allow us to proceed with the remaining steps.\n3.

The next step will involve squaring both sides of this equation to get rid of the square root. $\\left(\\sqrt{6x^2-x}\\right)^2=\\left(3x-\\frac32\\right)^2$.\n5. When we square the left-hand side, we obtain $6x^2-x$. On the right-hand side, we obtain $9x^2-6x+\\frac9{4}$.\n6. Combine the x terms and constant terms on both sides. $6x^2-x=9x^2-6x+\\frac9{4}$.\n7. Subtract the left-hand side from the right-hand side to combine the x terms and constant terms. $5x^2+\\frac{5}{4}=0$.\n8. Factor the left-hand side to get $x^2+\\frac14=0$. This is equivalent to $(x+\\frac12)(x-\\frac12)=0$.\n9. Using the zero product property, we have $x+\\frac12=0$ or $x-\\frac12=0$. This means that $x=-\\frac12$ or $x=\\frac12$.\n10. However, there is a slight issue with $x=-\\frac12$, as the denominator in the original equation can equal 0 and the original equation is undefined.
