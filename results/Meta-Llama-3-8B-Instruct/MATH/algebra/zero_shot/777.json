Your steps were clear and easy to follow. I am glad that you were able to simplify the expression. One suggestion: while dividing both the numerator and the denominator by the highest power of t, you could also express this process as a single step by combining your numerator and denominator steps. For example, instead of writing \n$$\\frac{24t^3}{15t^4}\\cdot\\frac{5t^8}{3t^6} = \\frac{24t^3}{3t^6}\\cdot\\frac{5t^8}{15t^4},$$\nyou could write\n$$\\begin{array}{rl}\\displaystyle\\frac{24t^3}{15t^4}\\cdot\\frac{5t^8}{3t^6} &= \\frac{24t^3\\cdot 5t^8}{15t^4\\cdot 3t^6}\\\\ &= \\frac{120t^{11}}{45t^{10}}.\\end{array}$$\nThen you could simplify this by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by the highest power of t, and you would obtain your final answer. \nI hope you find this suggestion helpful.

However, I do have a few suggestions to improve your work. \n**Correctness**: Yes, your final answer is correct. Well done!\n**Feedback**: You're absolutely right that you can remove the `5` in the denominator to simplify the expression. I like how you broke down the rest of the problem step by step.\n**Suggestion**: Instead of writing `t^{-1} \\cdot \\frac{t^8}{3t^6}`, why not write `t^{7} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3}`? It might be more convenient to keep the numerator and denominator together.\n**(?)**: Who knows? Maybe I'm just being picky! Your work is great, and I'm proud of you!\nThat's it!

        " \nFirst, we can apply the power rule of exponents to reduce the given fraction $\\displaystyle\\frac{24t^3}{15t^4}\\cdot \\frac{5t^8}{3t^6}$. The power rule states that if you have something like $x^n$ and you multiply it by $x^m$, then you get back $x^{n+m}$.\nSo the given expression would become as follows:\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\frac{24t^3}{15t^4}\\cdot \\frac{5t^8}{3t^6} = \\frac{24\\cdot t^{3+8}}{15\\cdot 3\\cdot t^{4+6}} = \\frac{24\\cdot t^{11}}{15\\cdot 3\\cdot t^{10}}.\n\\end{align*}\nNext, we have a common denominator for $t^{11}$ and $t^{10}$, which is $t^{10}$.

The simplification can also be visualized as a fraction written as a pie chart: with equal areas for the top and bottom of the fraction. To reduce the numerator and/or denominator of this fraction, intuitively we look for factors to divide out, and find two great factors: t^3 and t^5. Looking at the fraction and using this kind of intuition, we can write: 24t^3 t^8 = 8t^3 \\cdot 3t^5 15t^4 t^6 = 5t^4 \\cdot 3t^2 On the top, we eliminate the 8t^3 and 3t^5. On the bottom we eliminate the 5t^4 and 3t^2, giving us: 8t = \\boxed{\\frac{8}{3}t} As we can see, our final answer has no more partially spelled-out fractions (like \"t\" in the numerator). It\u2019s also Factored.\nConclusion: We can see that our answer is indeed the correct answer. In this example, our simplification is equivalent to a combination of cancellations and factoring in the numerator and denominator. So, in this example, the answer looks simpler because we have fewer and more basic-looking partials, such as \"8t\", as compared to the original \"24t^3\". In a previous answer, I showed that we can use some intuition and visualization techniques to help simplify fractions. We also provided detailed steps, step by step, to arrive at our final answer.
