If we let \\( t \\) be the number of days it takes for 15 workers to finish the job, the total work done by 15 workers in \\( t \\) days can be expressed as:\n\\[\n\\text{Work done by 15 workers} = 15 \\text{ workers} \\times t \\text{ days}\n\\]\nSetting this equal to the total work required (9 worker-days), we get:\n\\[\n15t = 9\n\\]\nTo solve for \\( t \\), we divide both sides by 15:\n\\[\nt = \\frac{9}{15}\n\\]\nNext, we simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{9}{15}\\):\n\\[\nt = \\frac{3}{5}\n\\]\nThus, it takes 15 construction workers \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) of a day to finish building the house. \nIn conclusion, the time it takes for 15 construction workers to finish building the house is \n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{3}{5}}\n\\]",

        " six construction workers take 1.5 days to finish 1 house, so it would take one worker 9 days to finish 1 house.

I hope it is correct. ### It's better explicit, right?  In this, it is natural to say that 8 times more workers is 8 times faster, or 1/8 times longer.  Well, the original house takes 1.5 days, it takes 1/8 times longer for 15 workers, so the final answer is 1.5 * (9/8) = (9*1.5)/8 = 13.5/8, or simplifying 13.5 / 8 = 1.6875 = 13.5 / 8 = 1.6875\nLet\u2019s make it more natural with numbers.  6 workers build 1 house in 1.5 days, so 1.5 * 1 = 1.5 house-days.  But there are 1.5 house-days.  Divide up this work into smaller tasks as people wanted, this is just a single example of how it works, into individual workload tasks.\n$two_thirds_of_a_task=two_thirds_of_one_and_half=2/3 * 1.5=2/3 * (1.5)=1$So two-thirds of one-and-a-half is equal to one task.\n$half_a_task=half_of_one_and_half=1/2 * 1.5=1.5/2=3/4$So half a task is equal to three-fourths of a task.\nUpon completing one and a half tasks, you can complete one task, so $\\frac{8}{3}ths$ of tasks are still left.  These remaining tasks will be completed in 9 days.  Lastly, multiply the remaining tasks with the number of days for the task, and a final answer of 9 days appears. 15 workers can build a house days within a day.\nThe speed change shows that the 15 workers for a house in 9 days.

        " #### Step 1: First, we think of the 6 workers as the denominator and the number of days to 1.5 days as the numerator of the fraction 6/1.5. So, the rate of the 6 workers per day is 6/1.5. \n### ",
        " 1/10\nYou have a sample problem where you have 6 construction workers, and they can build a house in 1.5 days. Every time, we have some workers, and they can build a house. They can build it in certain time. We need to think about 15 workers and how long they would take to build that same house.\n### Explanation:\nLet\u2019s start. We know that we have 6 construction workers that build a house in 1.5 days. That means 1 / 1.5 = 2/3 of a house is built by 1 worker in 1 day. We are going to multiply the workers by 15, so it is going to be 2/3 * 15 = 10. That means we have 10/1.5 = 2/3 of a house built by 15 workers in 1 day. It takes them 1/2 of a day for them to finish the last 1/3 of the house. It takes 15 workers 1/2 of a day to finish the house.\nThat means it takes 15 workers 1/2 of a day, or 1/2 of a day in fraction form as \u00bd.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \u00bd.

Hence, it would take 15 construction workers ($\\frac{1}{15}$ of a day) of building time to build a house. \nIn other words, it would take them $\\frac{1}{15}$ * 9 = $\\frac{3}{5}$ days to build a house. \nHence, it takes 15 construction workers $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{5}}$ days to build a house.",
        " First, we know 6 construction workers can build the house in 1.5 days.  The total work needed for the house is then: 6 \\cdot 1.5 = 9 days of work. Notice this is the total time needed for all workers to finish the job,  so we can think about it like this:\n### 9 equations = 9 whole days of work.\nFor 15 workers, we have a larger number of full days of work.

We know that $\\boldsymbol{6}$ men working together for $\\boldsymbol{1.5}$ days build one house. So we have\n$$6x=1.5\\Rightarrow x=\\frac{1.5}{6}=\\frac{1}{4}.$$It follows that the number of man-days required for one man to build a house is $\\frac{1}{4}$, or 0.25 days.\n#### Step 2: Determine the number of man-days required for each man to build a house when there are $\\boldsymbol{15}$ men.\nFor 15 men, it will take:\n$$15\\cdot \\frac{1}{4}=\\boxed{\\frac{15}{4}=\\frac{5}{4}=\\frac{1}{4}\\cdot 5=0.375}=0.375$$ man-days for each man to build a house.

How long does it take 15 construction workers, working at the same rate, to finish building a house?  Express your answer as a fraction in lowest terms.\nLet\u2019s think step by step.",
        " The fractional answer is \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{5}}. The units in the problem are not clearly indicated, so let\u2019s assume the workers can build 1 house in 1.5 days, which means six workers build one house in $\\frac{1.5}{6}=\\frac{1}{4}$ of a day. Therefore, one worker can build $\\frac{1}{4}$ of a house in a day. Since 15 workers work together, they can build $\\frac{1}{4}$ of a house in $\\frac{1}{15}$ of a day. Therefore, they can build a full house in $1\\div\\frac{1}{15}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{5}}$ of a day. Final Answer: The final answer is \\frac{1}{5}. I hope it is correct.  Because the whole problem deals with the part of a day as well, I think it\u2019s more meaningful to present the final answer as a number of 15ths of a day. Final Answer: The final answer is $\\frac{1}{15}$ as well. We can check this by finding the work that one worker can do in 1 day.  Since 15 workers take $\\frac{1}{5}$ of a day to complete 1 house, all 15 workers take 1 day to complete 5 houses.  Since one worker takes 1 day to complete $1/6$ of a house, one worker takes $\\dfrac{5}{6}$ of a day to complete 1 house. Therefore, 15 workers working together complete 1 house in 1 day.  To ensure that this can be written in lowest terms, repeat 15 instead of using 15 as the denominator. We have confirmed in advance that we are working with minutes. Final Answer: The final answer is 1/5. I hope it is correct.  This explanation is a bit more circular because you still have to determine that there are 6 workers. But I hope it can help someone understand why the correct answer is 1/5. Final Answer: The final answer is 1/5. I hope it is correct. Best regards.\nNow, determine we use.\nWe use the unit question to convert units even further to understand.

        " The 6 workers take 1.5 days. 15 workers work 1.5/6 times as fast as 6 workers.  Thus, the 15 workers take (1.5 /6) days to finish building a house.  It all boils down to dividing 1.5 by 6.   We get:\n$$\\frac{1.5}{6} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$$ Final Answer: The final answer is 1/4. I hope it is correct. I have used method of scaling. I think there is a mistake in your question.  15 construction workers can build a house in $\\frac{1}{4}$ day.  It is wrong.  15 construction workers take less than $\\frac{1}{4}$ day to build a house.  The rate of 1 worker is $\\frac{1}{1.5} = \\frac{2}{3}$.  15 workers means 15 of this rate.  In 1 hr, 15 workers build $\\frac{2}{3}\\times 15 = 10$ units.  Therefore, the workers need $\\frac{1}{10}$ day to finish building a house. I hope it is correct. Final Answer: The final answer is 1/10. I hope it is correct. I see that my previous answer was wrong.  I will make sure to double check my answer.  In this case, if 6 workers can build a house in 1.5 days, then 1 worker can build $\\frac{1}{6}$ of a house in 1.5 days.  In 1 day, 1 worker can build $\\frac{2}{3}$ of a house.  15 workers can build $15\\times\\frac{2}{3} = 10$ houses in 1 day, so 1 house in $\\frac{1}{10}$ day.  Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{10}}$. I hope it is correct. Final Answer: The final answer is 1/10. I hope it is correct. It's called the inverse rate.  It means one that is the multiplier for the rate is used as a divisor for time.  We have 1/6 house built per day by 1 worker.  So we have a rate of 6/1 of the inverse rate of a house per day.  6/1",

From 1 to 6 indicates that the time required to complete the construction process will increase. As you increase the number of people in each of these positions. It will become more efficient with more people for a similar job. That's why six people can finish this task in 1.5 days.  Duration is (1.5x6) = 9 days.
