        " \nI have $90+1$ and $90$ squared in my head. For $90$ squared, I can also use the neighbor\u2019s method (i.e., subtract and then add):\n$$90^2 = (90-8+8)^2 = 82^2+2\\cdot 90\\cdot 8 + 64 = (80 + 2)^2 + 2\\cdot 80\\cdot 2 + 64 = (80^2 + 2^2+2\\cdot80\\cdot 2).$$So now I just need to compute\n$$91^2 = (90+1)^2 = 90^2 + 2\\cdot90\\cdot1 + 1 = 90^2+180+1.$$\nI had computed $90^2$ in my previous step, and by simply thinking about counting, I know that $180+64=244$ is $4\\cdot61$, so the answer is my original $90^2$ given by $$\\boxed{8300}.$$\n### Explanation:\nThe goal is to compute $91^2$ mentally. We factor $91^2 = (90+1)^2$ and apply the \u201cneighbor\u201d method, which allows us to reduce the computation to $90^2$, which we already know. This method is based on viewing $x^2=(x+1)^2-2x-1$ and thus allows us to factor out a small part from the original expression. In our case, this is the factor $90^2$ that we already computed in our head. The remaining terms can be handled simply by counting. In this case, the terms $2\\cdot 90\\cdot 1$ and $1$ contribute $180+1 = 181$ to the sum. \nGiven $90$ squared in my head, I use the neighbor\u2019s method to reduce computing $91^2$ to $90^2$ plus a small additional amount. I count the amount, namely $180+1=181,$ and add it to $90^2$ in my head, giving the final answer, $\\boxed{8300}$.\n### Key points:\n1. Factor the expression into two easier parts.\n2. Apply the \u201cneighbor\u201d method to reduce the part that is already difficult.\n3. Count or compute the remaining, smaller part.\n4. Add the two parts together. \n### References:\n[1] R. J.",

In order to square it, I need to multiply $91$ by itself, so it becomes $91\\times 91$.\n2. Next, I recognize that $90\\times 90=8,100$. So, the first step is to calculate $(90\\times 90)\\times 1$. It's easy to calculate $90\\times 90$ in my head. Now, we can multiply this result by 1.\n3. This is where I see an opportunity to simplify things: $91=90+1$, so $91\\times 91=(90+1)(90+1)=90\\times 90+2\\times 90+1=\\underline{8,100}+180+1$.\n4.

The response uses a clever trick: subtracting $90^2$ from $100^2$ to compute $91^2$. This trick is based on the general fact that $x^2 = (x + 1)^2 - 2x - 1$. In this case, $x = 90$ and we use the trick to simplify $91^2$. The response shows how to perform this computation in one's head.\n#### Assumptions: \nThis response is valid because it uses a clear and concise strategy to calculate $91^2$ in the respondent's head. It is also based on a general fact that can be applied to more instances where people need to calculate $(x + 1)^2$ - for numbers that are close to but not equal to $100$.\n#### Relevance: This response is relevant to the original question because it provides a clever and efficient method to calculate the squared value of a number close to $100$ in one's head.\n#### Feedback: The approach used in this response is strong because it employs a fundamental math concept ($x^2 = (x + 1)^2 - 2x - 1$) to simplify the problem, avoiding multiplication and allowing for an efficient solution. However, the response could be improved by providing more context or explanations about the general fact used, making it more accessible to a broader audience. For example, explaining the origin of the formula or providing examples of when it is useful. ",

        " $81+10\\times 90 +10\\times 10 = 81 + 900+100= 81+1000 = 1081$\nAlternatively, observe that $91=100-9$ and that $9=11-2$, so \\begin{align*} 91^2 &= (100-9)^2 = 10000-200+81 = 9000+81 = \\boxed{1081}.\\end{align*}\n```\n### what you doing in this problem\nThe problem is to compute $91^2$ in your head without using a calculator or pen and paper. \nThere are two main methods being used in the problem:\n1. The first method is to break down $91$ into smaller parts, specifically $81, 10$ and $90$. \n   It calculates $81^2 = 6561$ and then adds $10 \\times 90 + 10 \\times 10 = 900 + 100 = 1000$ to get the final answer of $6561 + 1000 = 1081$.\n2. The second method is to use the distributive property to break down $91$ into $(100-9)^2$ by using the rules of exponent laws. It calculates $(100-9)^2 = 10000-200+81$ and simplifies it by combining like terms to get the final answer of $9000+81 = 1081$.",
        " $91^2$ in my head:\n1. Rewrite $91$ in terms of $90$, which is $10\\times9$, and an extra $1$:\n91 = 90 + 1\n2. Compute $(90+1)^2$ using the difference of squares formula:\n$(90+1)^2 = (90)^2 + 2(90)(1) + 1^2$\n3. Expand $(90)^2$ and regroup terms:\n$(90)^2 + 2(90)(1) + 1^2 = 8100 + 180 + 1$\n4. Add up these terms: \n8100 + 180 + 1 = 8281\nSo $91^2 = \\boxed{8281}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 8281. I hope it is correct.  You can also find the result by calculating the area of a rectangle with the help of its area. In this case, you have to compute area of (91 * 91) by drawing a rectangle and counting the area. You will have the same result which is 8281, Area of rectangle would be $91 \\times 91$ = 8281. \nThat was my explanation. Please let me know if anything requires correction.  I hope it helps you to understand more!  Or if you have any question, feel free to ask.  You can also find more resources online or other educational materials that can help you with this kind of computing. Thank you!

Prove that for any $x \\in G$, there exists a unique element $x^{-1}$ such that $x x^{-1} = e$.\n \u8a08\u7b97\u7ed3\u679c: http://www4a.wcer.edu/ntti/dissemination/researchrep/AppendixD/Stevens appendix D.pdf \\\n**Proof:**\n**Existence of $x^{-1}$**\nGiven that $x \\in G$. We have that $$e = x x^{-1} \\implies x = x x^{-1} e = x (x^{-1} e).$$Set $y = x^{-1} e$, then the above equation becomes $x = x y$. This implies that $\\mathrm{ord}(x) | \\mathrm{ord}(y)$. However, since $\\mathrm{ord}(x) | \\mathrm{ord}(x y) = \\mathrm{ord}(x)$, the order of $x y$ is a divisor of the order of $x$. Thus, the order of $x y$ is either $1$ or identical to the order of $x$.\nIf the order of $x y$ is $1$, then $x y = e$. This means that $x = x e = x (y e) = x y = e$. And then we have $e = x^{-1} e$ or $x^{-1} = e$. This is not the inverse we want. Thus, we must have $\\mathrm{ord}(x) = \\mathrm{ord}(x y)$.\nAs $G$ is a group, it is necessarily a trap group. Therefore, $x y$ cannot have a larger order than $x$. The only option remaining is for the order to be equal. Then, $x y$ is an element in $G$ with the same order as $x$. This makes $x y$ an element of the group $(G)$. Thus, $y = e$.\nWe have $x = x e$ then $x = x y",
