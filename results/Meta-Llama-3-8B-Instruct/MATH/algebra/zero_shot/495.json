But these are contradictory constraints. Therefore, $p(x)$ is not defined anywhere. It does not have any domain.",
        " First, we can start by evaluating the domain of $p(x) = \\sqrt{-x}$. This means that $x$ cannot be equal to 0. Why? Well, since the square root of a negative number will always be complex. So we have $x \\neq 0$. ",
        " \nLet's figure this out step by step.\nWe know that $p(x) = \\sqrt{-x}$, and we also know that the domain of $\\sqrt{x}$ is $x \\ge 0$. Therefore, we must have $-x \\ge 0$, or $x \\le 0$ in order for $\\sqrt{-x}$ to be well-defined.\nNow, the domain of $q(x) = 8x^2 + 10x - 3$ is all real numbers, because the square of any real number is a non-negative real number, and the sum of a real number and any constant is a real number.\nWhen we substitute $q(x)$ into $p(x)$, we get $p(q(x)) = \\sqrt{-8x^2 - 10x + 3}$. Thus, we must have $-8x^2 - 10x + 3 \\ge 0$. Simplifying this, we get $x^2 + \\frac{5}{4}x - \\frac{3}{8} \\ge 0$. Let\u2019s complete the square in order to see what the domain is.\n$x^2 + \\frac{5}{4}x + \\frac{25}{16} - \\frac{25}{16} - \\frac{3}{8} \\ge 0$\n$(x+\\frac{5}{8})^2 - \\frac{17}{16} \\ge 0$\n$(x+\\frac{5}{8})^2 \\ge \\frac{17}{16}$\nSo, we have $(x+\\frac{5}{8})^2 \\ge \\frac{17}{16} \\ge 0$, and thus $x+\\frac{5}{8} \\ge -\\frac{\\sqrt{17}}{4}$, or $x \\ge -5-\\frac{\\sqrt{17}}{4}$.\nSimilarly, $(x+\\frac{5}{8})^2 \\le \\frac{17}{16}$, and thus $x+\\frac{5}{8} \\le \\frac{\\sqrt{17}}{4}$, or $x \\le -5+\\frac{\\sqrt{17}}{4}$.\nHence, we can write the domain of $p(q(x))$ as $-5-\\frac{\\sqrt{17}}{4} \\le x \\le -5+\\frac{\\sqrt{17}}{4}$. Therefore",
        " It should be noted that p(x) is only defined when x is not positive. Thus, we should consider the domain of q(x) and get rid of the x values in the domain of q(x) that are positive. Therefore, if we want to solve -8x^2-10x+3\\ge0, then we should complete the square to achieve\n$-2x^2-5x+\\frac{25}{4}+3\\ge0\\Rightarrow \\left(-x-\\frac{5}{4}\\right)^2+\\frac{25}{4}-\\frac{4}{4}\\ge0\\Rightarrow (\\sqrt{-x}-\\frac{5}{4})^2\\ge\\frac{1}{4}$.\nNote that $$\\left| \\sqrt{-x}-\\frac{5}{4} \\right|\\ge\\frac{1}{2}.$$Then, we should let $x$ in the given interval, which is determined by the equation $\\sqrt{-x}-\\frac{5}{4}=-\\frac{1}{2}$ or $\\sqrt{-x}-\\frac{5}{4}=\\frac{1}{2}$.

Its domain is $x \\neq -\\frac{3}{2}$ and $x \\neq \\frac{1}{2}$ therefore we have $-\\infty < x < -\\frac{3}{2}$ or $x> \\frac{1}{2}$. So the domain of $p(q(x))$ is the same as $p(q(x))$.\nThe domain of $p(q(x))$ is $x >\\frac{1}{2}$ for here $p(x)=\\sqrt{-x}$ means the output is real and positive.",
        " \n1. What is the domain of $q(x)$?\nFrom the expression of $q(x)$, we can see that the polynomial is defined for all real $x$, thus $q(x)$ is defined for all real $x$.\n2. What is $p(x)$?\n $p(x)$ is defined as $\\sqrt{-x}$, so $p(x)$ is defined only if $-x\\ge 0$. This implies that $x\\le0$.\n3. Therefore, $p(q(x))$ is defined only if $x\\le0$ and the expression inside the square root is real.\nThe expression inside the square root is $-q(x)$, which is also the expression inside the square root of $p(x)$. For this expression to be real, we require that $-q(x)\\ge0$, or equivalently, $q(x)\\le0$.\n4. From the previous step, we know that the expression inside the square root is real if $x\\le0$. In particular, if $x\\le0$, then $q(x)$ could potentially be non-negative.\n5. So, the largest value of $x$ such that $p(q(x))$ is defined is the largest value of $x$ such that $q(x)\\le0$.\nTo find this largest value, we can set $q(x)=0$. This equation is equivalent to $0=8x^2+10x-3$, which has two roots: $-\\frac{3}{4}$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. These roots are the largest and smallest values of $x$ such that $q(x)=0$. Because we are only interested in the largest, we take $x=\\frac{1}{4}$.\nSo, we have that $p(q)\\le \\frac{1}{4}$, so $a$ is $\\frac{1}{4}$.\nFrom Step 2, we have that $p(q(x))$ is defined for all $x\\le0$. We already found the largest value of $x$ that is less than or equal to $0$ and also makes $p(q(x))$ defined.\nThis value is $\\frac{1}{4}$ from before, so we have that $b$ is $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n$${b-a=\\frac{1}{4}-\\frac{1}{4}=0}$$\nFinal Answer: 0.

Since $q(x)$ is a quadratic function, it is defined on all real numbers.  Therefore, in order to find the domain of $p(q(x))$, we must find the values of $x$ such that $p(q(x))$ is defined.

        " First, we can look at the domain of $q(x)$. Since there are no square roots or trig functions, we know that this domain is the entire real line. Now we look at the expression $x=q(x)$. Since $q(x)=8x^2+10x-3$, we know that the only place where an issue might arise is when the expression inside the square root in $p(x)=\\sqrt{-x}$ is non-negative. So, we can solve $-x\\le 0$, or $0\\ge-x$, or $0\\ge x$. So, $x\\ge0$, or $0\\le x$. This means that the domain is $[0,b]$, where $b$ will be a later problem. Now we look at $p(q(x))$. It is important to realize that we did not change the function we are working with at all. $q(x)$ is still the entire real line. So the domain of $p(q(x))$ is still $[0,b]$. Now we look at $b$. Since the graph of the function $f(x)=8x^2+10x-3$, $f(4)=23$, we know that $b$ is an upper bound on this domain. In order to find $b$, we simply plug in the largest value for $x$, in this case 4, to find $b$. We get $b=\\sqrt{-(8(4)^2+10(4)-3)} = \\sqrt{-59} \\approx 7.68$. So, $b$ is approximately 7.68.\n### Answer: To write the domain in the form $a \\le x \\le b$, we have $a = 0$ because we cannot take the square root of a negative number. Also, $b$ is the largest value of $x$ that still works. So, the domain is $\\boxed{0\\le x\\le7.68}$.

We substitute $x\\le 0$ to obtain $p(q(x))=\\sqrt{8x^2+10x-3}$.\nThe domain is all real numbers such that $8x^2+10x-3\\ge 0$. We solve the inequality $8x^2+10x-3\\ge 0$. When $x=0$, then $-3\\ge 0$. Not possible. When $x$ is very large negative, then $8x^2+10x-3$ is always positive since $8x^2$ is very large positive and $10x-3$ is always positive. Now, we let $x=-1/4$. So, on the boundary is when $x=-1/4$, then $8x^2+10x-3=0$. In order to have the function",
        " First, we need to find the domain of $q(x)$.\nIf an even degree polynomial, such as $8x^2$, is involved, then there is no constraint on the sign of $x$. So, the domain of $q(x)$ is the entire real line $\\boxed{(-\\infty, \\infty)}.$\n### New coefficient: $a$\n### New coefficient: $b$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 120.

Now that we have the domain of $q(x)$, we can proceed to the domain of $\\sqrt{q(x)}$.  We have that $\\sqrt{q(x)}$ exists whenever $q(x) \\ge 0,$ so we have that\n\\begin{align*} \\text{ domain of }\\sqrt{q(x)} &=\\{x: q(x)\\ge 0\\} \\\\ & =\\{x: 8x^2+10x-3\\ge 0\\} \\\\ &=\\{x: 8x^2+10x\\ge 3\\}. \\end{align*}\n### New Coefficient: 1.\nTo continue with the inequality $8x^2+10x\\ge 3$:\n1.1. In order to have $8x^2+10x\\ge 3$ we must have the distributive property\nsuch that 8x^2+10x-3 \\ge 0, so it becomes 8x^2+10x\\ge 3, then we can set this to zero like that:\nAlso then we made solving 8x^2+10x=3.\n1.2. All pragmatically, for there to be a value we should simply set  8x^2+10x-3 \\ge 0, solve it.\n### ",
        " \nTo solve the problem, I broke it down into smaller parts.\nStep 1: Determine the domain of $q(x)$.\nThe expression $8x^2+10x-3$ can be rewritten as $8x^2+10x-3=(2x+1)(4x-3)$. Therefore, $q(x)=(2x+1)(4x-3)$ will be a real value if the term inside the parentheses is real. Hence, the inequality $-1/2\\le x\\le3/4$ (write the inequality by solving for $x$).\nThe domain of $q(x)$ is $-1/2\\le x\\le3/4$.\nStep 2: Determine the domain of $p(q(x))$.\nAccording to the problem, $p(x)=\\sqrt{-x}$. Therefore, $p(q(x))=p(8x^2+10x-3)=\\sqrt{-[8x^2+10x-3]}=\\sqrt{-[(2x+1)(4x-3)]}$.\nWe can simplify this expression, and the new expression will still be a real value if the term inside the square root is real. In other words, $-[(2x+1)(4x-3)]\\ge0$. This can be written as $(2x+1)(4x-3)\\le0$, which can be solved for $x$ to get $-1/2\\le x\\le3/4$. Thus, the domain of $p(q(x))$ is also $-1/2\\le x\\le3/4$.\nStep 3: Calculate the difference $b-a$.\nThe difference $b-a$ is just the value between the upper and lower bounds of the domain.\nSince $b=3/4$ and $a=-1/2$, we have\n$b-a=\\frac{3}{4}-\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)=\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{3}{4}$."
