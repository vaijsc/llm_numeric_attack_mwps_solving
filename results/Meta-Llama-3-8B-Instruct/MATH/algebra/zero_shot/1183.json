To calculate this, we need to use the distributive property, cancel out the terms that don\u2019t have a $x$ or $x$\u2019s in them, and then combine like terms. If we look at the two terms, $(x^5+3x^2+3x^5)$ and $(x^7+2x^2+6x^5)$, we can pull out the $x^5$ term from the first expression and put it alongside the $x^5$ from the second expression.\n#### Add-ons: I'll get a little deeper.",

        "  Simplify the expression $(x^5+3x^2+3x^5)-(x^7+2x^2+6x^5)$: \nWe have two techniques for simplifying  expressions. We can either use the distributive property or our understandings of exponents. \nFor the first term, we have $$x^5+3x^2+3x^5$$It doesn\u2019t matter in what order you add these terms. So, we can use our understandings of exponents:\n$$x^5+3x^2+3x^5=x^5+x^5+3x^2=\\boxed{4x^5+3x^2}$$\nFor the second term, we have $$x^7+2x^2+6x^5$$We can try to add these terms in any order. $x^2$ doesn\u2019t affect $x^7$ or $x^5$, so there is no success in simplifying the second term alone. So, it seems that just using our understandings of exponents and subtracting won\u2019t give us a simplified expression.\nWe can rewrite the $x^7$ in terms of $x^5$. We have $$x^7+2x^2+6x^5=x^7-x^5+9x^5+2x^2=\\boxed{x^5(x^2+9)+2x^2}$$\nNow, we can subtract our first term from our second: \n$$(x^5+3x^2+3x^5)-(x^7+2x^2+6x^5)=\\boxed{-x^5+3x^2-x^5(x^2+9)-2x^2=-x^5(x^2+9)-x^2=x^2 (-x^5(x^2+9)-1)}$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $x^2(-x^5 (x^2 + 9) - 1)$.
