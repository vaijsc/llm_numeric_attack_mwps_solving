        " Since the roots are complex, they are in the form of $r_1=\\frac{-b\\pm i\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$.\nSo we can plug in the complex roots into the formula as the following:\n$r_1=\\frac{-5\\pm i\\sqrt{11}}{6}$. Compare it with the formula.\nWe have $r_1=\\frac{-5\\pm i\\sqrt{11}}{6}=\\frac{-b\\pm i\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$.\nWe can do a little bit of algebra.\n$-5=\\frac{-b}{2a}$ and $\\sqrt{11}=\\frac{\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$.\nSimplifying them, we get:\n$-10a=b$ and $11= b^2-4ac$. These are two equations with two variables (a and b). If we solve them, we should be able to get a value of a and b.\nNow, let\u2019s try to solve them.\nFrom $-10a=b$, we can plug it into the second equation.\n$$11=(-10a)^2-4ac$$ Distribute the terms on the right-hand side.\n$$11=100a^2-4ac$$ Simplify it.\n$$11=100a^2-4ac$$\nNow, let\u2019s think of what we can do next.\n### Affirmation:\nWe can subtract $100a^2$ from both sides of the equation to get:\n$$-89a^2-4ac+11=0$$ and we can factor out the $-a$ on the left-hand side.\nFactor out $-a$. We have $a=-\\frac{11}{89}$. Let\u2019s plug it back into the initial equation.\n$\\frac{-b}{-11/89}=5$.\n$\\frac{-10a}{-11/89}=5$. Let\u2019s simplify the equation.\nCross-multiply. So we have $89\\cdot 10=550=11b$.\nSo we have $b=\\frac{550}{11}$.\nWe can put everything together now. We know $a=-\\frac{11}{89}, b=\\frac{550}{11}$.
