I hope it is correct.  ### Steps I will follow the steps to find the width of the domain of the function. I understand that the width of the domain is the difference between the maximum value of the domain and the minimum value of the domain. Now, it's time to find the maximum and minimum values of the domain. Since we want to find the domain of the function, we must first find the values of $x$ such that the expression inside the square root is non-negative. Let's consider the first square root term $\\sqrt{25-x^2}$. The value of $x$ should be in such a way that the expression inside the square root is non-negative. In other words, $25-x^2\\ge0$. This equation represents a circle with center at $(0,25/2)$ and radius $5$. Therefore, all points inside this circle satisfy the equation. Now, we have to consider the value of $x$ for which $-(x-2)\\ge0$. This is true when $x\\le2$ or $x\\ge2$. So, combining these two conditions, we get the domain as $[-5,2]$. $$\n### Step 4: Final Answer\nFrom Step 3, we can see that the domain of the function is [-5,2]. We now have to find the width of this domain. The width of the domain is the difference between the maximum value of the domain and the minimum value of the domain. The maximum value of the domain is 2 and the minimum value of the domain is -5. Hence, the width of the domain is $2-(-5)=7$. Therefore, the final",

If we think geometrically, $\\sqrt{25-x^2}+\\sqrt{-(x-2)}$ makes sense only when $-5 \\leq x \\leq 5$, because $\\sqrt{25-x^2}$ is the distance between $x$ and $5$, and $\\sqrt{-(x-2)}$ is always positive (it is the distance between $x$ and $2$ along the imaginary axis).

        " Hint: Focus on the $\\sqrt{-}$ part.

Now, the radicand of the other square root is $25-x^2$, so we know that $-x^2+25\\ge0$. Adding $x^2$ to both sides, we have $25\\ge x^2$, and because $x\\le2$, we have $x\\ge-2$. Putting the restrictions for both roots together, we get a domain of $[-2,2]$, which has a width of $\\boxed{4}$.\n(To confirm, the domain is the same if we combine $\\sqrt{-}$ and $+\\sqrt{}$ as $\\sqrt{(25-x^2)-x^2+4}-x+4\\ge0$, which gives a domain of $[-2,2]$.)\n",

        " The first part of the square root function is fine. 25 - x^2 is always nonnegative. This is since the maximum it could reach is 25 and the smallest it could reach is 0.\n### Simplification: Since we know that 25 - x^2 is the top of the square root, we can simplify it as 25. Now we put in the other part of the square root.\nThe square root of a number cannot be negative. But again, negative number makes square root negative. When the square root of a negative number, it means it equals to i * sqrt of that number. We know that - number can be made into fraction by dividing it by -1. So we solve $(x \u2013 2)$ equals to 0.\nWe know that 0 comes in the denominator when the equation is divided by -1, so it would be unsafe division. The equation $(x \u2013 2)$ equals to 0 means we would get \u201cwrong\u201d results. If we give \u2013$2 in input (2,-1) we could find the table of function: * Set up coordinate plane.

Points (2,-1). * Check the sign(positive or negative) of both of the square roots. * Always positive. * Now connect (-1 and \u2013 2) : We did not solve for x.it just means the x is greater than or equal to 2 ! As we proceed to split up, we get graph of function h(x) = 25 \u2013 x^2. Now graph h(x) = sqrt(25-x^2) and graph h(x) = -x+2.\n### Answer 1: It is getting clearer. We have graphed one side we need other. We see that x = 4 is the left limit of the interval.\nAs we see that sqrt(25-x^2) cannot have real values when x > 4 (hence less than 2 sohaye points. When x > 4, points become imaginary). Another note is that \u2013x+2 can never be \u20132 when x is 4 or more, so sqrt(-1) becomes real value(0).\nLast point. If inputs of second square root are negative(i would never explainable input second value we would not expect to input what will never happen).\nWe will use x \u2013 2 = 0.
