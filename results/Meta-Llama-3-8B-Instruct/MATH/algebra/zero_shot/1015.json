    "solution": "Writing this as an inequality, we get the expression \\begin{align*} n^2-5n-14&<0 \\quad \\Rightarrow\n\\\\ (n-7)(n+2)&<0.\n\\end{align*} Since -2 and 7 are roots of the quadratic, the inequality must change sign at these two points. Thus, we continue by testing the 3 intervals of $n$. For $n<-2$, both factors of the inequality are negative, thus making it positive. For $-2<n<7$, only $n-7$ is negative, so the inequality is negative. Finally, for $n>7$, both factors are positive, making the inequality positive once again. This tells us that the range of $n$ that satisfy the inequality is $-2<n<7$. Since the question asks for the smallest integer value of $n$, the answer is the smallest integer greater than $-2$, which is $\\boxed{-1}$.",

We want to find the smallest $n$ such that this expression is negative, i.e., we have a negative result.\nLet\u2019s make things easier by simplifying the expression. $n^2-5n-14$ is a quadratic expression.

        " \nLet's see. We need to find the smallest integer value of $n$ such that $n^2-5n-14$ is negative. Since $n^2$ is always non-negative, we have $-14\\ge n^2-5n$ . Hence, $14\\le 5n-n^2$ . Since $n$ is an integer, the right-hand side of the above inequality is minimized when $n$ is maximized in the interval $n\\in \\boxed{[0,7]}$. Since $n$ is an integer in this interval, let\u2019s consider the values of $n$ from 0 to 7 and evaluate the right-hand side of the inequality for each one. For example, when $n=0$, we get $14$ on the right-hand side. When $n=1$, we get $-4$. When $n=2$, we get $2$. When $n=3$, we get $8$. So the number is increasing, but we need to find the smallest integer $n$ such that this expression is negative. So we start again from $n=0$ and continue. Until we get a negative number, we can just keep going. For the value $n=6$, we have the value $\\frac{8}{1}$. At $n=7$, we get 42. We need to go further. We can look at the number after that (7+1=8). This way, we go up until we get a negative number. By inspecting the table below, we can see that we get negative 2 at 8. The picture for $\\boxed{n=8}$ is useful here. If we were to figure out the equation for $n$ as shown in Chapter 3, we would end up with $y = n^2-5n-14$ and $n=8$ in this case. Take a look at $n=8$. This is in the blue area, and we can simplify this as follows: If we start with $y = n^2-5n-14$, then this simplifies to $y = n^2-5n+5^2-5^2-14$ and $n^2-5n+25-31$.

We can start by writing the expression using factored form:\n\\begin{align*}n^2-5n-14 &= (n-7)(n+2)\\\\ &= (n - 7)(n+2).\\end{align*}\nWhen $n=7$, we have the $(n-7)(n+2)=0$ which means $n^2-5n-14$ will be equal to zero, or $n=7$.\nFor all values below $n=7$, $n^2-5n-14$ will be negative. Hence, the smallest integer value for $n$ that makes the expression $n^2-5n-14$ negative is $n=\\boxed{1}$.\nSo our answer for $n$ is $n=1$.

        " Your response seems incorrect. The integer values of $n$ such that $n^2-5n-14$ is negative are those with $n^2-5n-14<0.$ By factoring, we have $(n-7)(n+2)<0.$ If $n<0$, then $n+2<0\\Rightarrow n<-2.$ Since, if $n<-2$, then $n-7<-5$, and $(n-7)(n+2)<0$, it follows that $n$ should be an integer between $-2$ and $0.$ Since $n^2-5n-14$ is equivalent to $(n-7)(n+2),$ and $\\frac{d}{dn} (n^2-5n-14)=2n-5$, then the vertex is at $n=\\frac{5}{2}=2.5$.\nSince $2.5$ is not an integer, we must check the integer values of $n$ on both sides of the vertex. For $n=-2$, $n^2-5n-14=(-2)^2-5(-2)-14=4+10-14=0.$ For $n=-1$, $n^2-5n-14=(-1)^2-5(-1)-14=1+5-14=-8.$ Thus, we can see that $n$ can be any integer value less than $-2$.\n### Correct Answer: $n = \\boxed{-3}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -3.

Just a tiny suggestion: you could have also mentioned that $n^2 - 5n - 14$ can be factored as $(n - 7)(n + 2)$ using the factor theorem, which would have made it easier to find the smallest integer value of $n$ such that $n^2 - 5n - 14$ is negative.
