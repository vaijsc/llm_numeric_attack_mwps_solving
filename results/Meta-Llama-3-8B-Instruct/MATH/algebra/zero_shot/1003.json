        " The two factorizations need to contain different non zero factors in order to have the smallest domain possible. For the numerator, that would be when $2x-3$ or $2x+5$ never equal zero, which is all the numbers $x$ except $3/2$ and $-5/2$. For the denominator, the smallest domain is when both $3x-9$ and $3x+6$ are never equal to zero. But we can use factoring here. $(3x-9)(3x+6)=0$ when $3x=3$ or $-2$, so $x=1$ and $-1/2$.
