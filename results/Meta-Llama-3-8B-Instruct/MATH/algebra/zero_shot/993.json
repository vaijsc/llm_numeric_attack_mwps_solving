        "To find the smallest positive four-digit integer that is the product of two consecutive integers, we need to express the problem mathematically.\nLet the two consecutive integers be \\( n \\) and \\( n + 1 \\). The product of these integers can be expressed as:\n\\[\nP = n(n + 1) = n^2 + n\n\\]\nWe want to find the smallest value of \\( P \\) that is at least 1000 (the smallest four-digit number). Therefore, we need to solve the inequality:\n\\[\nn^2 + n \\geq 1000\n\\]\nTo find the threshold for \\( n \\), we can rearrange the inequality:\n\\[\nn^2 + n - 1000 \\geq 0\n\\]\nNext, we can use the quadratic formula to determine the critical points:\n\\[\nn = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\nIn our case, \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 1 \\), and \\( c = -1000 \\). Plugging in these values gives:\n\\[\nn = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (-1000)}}{2 \\cdot 1}\n\\]\n\\[\nn = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 4000}}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nn = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{4001}}{2}\n\\]\nNext, we calculate \\( \\sqrt{4001} \\approx 63.25 \\):\n\\[\nn \\approx \\frac{-1 + 63.25}{2} \\approx \\frac{62.25}{2} \\approx 31.125\n\\]\nSince \\( n \\) must be a whole number, we round up to the next integer, which gives \\( n = 32 \\). Let's check \\( n = 32 \\) and \\( n = 33 \\):\n1. Calculate \\( n = 32 \\):\n\\[\nP = 32 \\times 33 = 1056\n\\]\n2. Calculate \\( n = 31 \\) as a check:\n\\[\nP = 31 \\times 32 = 992\n\\]\nSince 992 is not a four-digit integer, we see that when \\( n = 32 \\), we achieve:\n\\[\nP = 1056\n\\]\nThus, the smallest positive four-digit integer that is the product of two consecutive integers is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1056}\n\\]",

We can approximate \\( n(n+1) \\) by considering the equation \\( n^2 \\approx 1000 \\). Taking the square root gives:\n\\[\nn \\approx \\sqrt{1000} \\approx 31.62\n\\]\nSince \\( n \\) must be an integer, we start testing from \\( n = 32 \\):\n1. For \\( n = 32 \\):\n   \\[\n   P = 32 \\times 33 = 1056\n   \\]\n   (This is a four-digit number.)\n2.

Therefore:\n\\[\nn \\approx \\frac{-1 + 200}{2} \\approx 99.5\n\\]\nThis suggests that \\( n \\) could be at most around 99. Thus, we check \\( n = 99 \\):\n1.

        " \nThe problem is asking us to find the smallest positive four-digit integer that is the product of two consecutive integers. We can start by assuming that the first integer is n. The second integer is (n+1), since they are consecutive. The product of these two integers is n(n+1). We want this product to be a four-digit integer, which means that n(n+1) must be greater than or equal to 1000. We also want to find the smallest possible value of n, so we can use the inequality to solve for n:\nn(n+1) \u2265 1000\nn^2+n \u2265 1000\nn^2+n-1000 \u2265 0\nThis is a quadratic function with the vertex at x=-b/2a = -1/2. The parabola opens upwards, so it intersects the x-axis at x=-20 and at x=50. Since we are looking for the smallest positive integer, we choose n=20.\nThe product of n and n+1 is 20*21 = 420, which is less than 1000. So, we need to increment n by 1. Setting n=21, we get:\n21*22 = 462, which is still less than 1000.\nWe can keep incrementing n by 1 until we get a product greater than or equal to 1000:\n22*23 = 506\n23*24 = 552\n24*25 = 600\n25*26 = 650\n26*27 = 702\n27*28 = 756\n28*29 = 812\n29*30 = 870\n30*31 = 930\n31*32 = 992\n32*33 = 1056\nThe smallest four-digit integer that is the product of two consecutive integers is 32*33 = 1056.\n### Answer: \nThe smallest positive four-digit integer that is the product of two consecutive integers is 1056, which is the product of 32 and 33.",

For example, we can have two numbers 100 and 101, which product is 10100. However, 1000 < 10100, so we should look for bigger numbers.\nTherefore, we need to calculate the product of every consecutive number. When we reach 100, the product is 100 \u00d7 101 = 10100.
