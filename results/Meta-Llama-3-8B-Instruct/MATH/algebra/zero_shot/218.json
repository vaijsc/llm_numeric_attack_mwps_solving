        " The easiest way to solve this is by drawing the figure. In order to simplify your drawing, let us choose the first coordinate as $x$, and the second as $y$. Point A has a $y$-coordinate of 1 and an $x$-coordinate of $-2$, so we can draw this point labeled as A. $M$, the midpoint, has a $y$-coordinate of $-3$ and an $x$-coordinate of $-1$, so we can draw this point labeled as M. We can draw point $B$ and label it, but we do not know its coordinates.\nNow that we see the picture, solving is easier. From $M$ and $A$, we can make a line segment joining them. $M$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$, so the line segment joining them will have a midpoint of $M$. Since $M$ is already at the midpoint, the midpoint of $\\overline{AM}$ is the point $M$. Therefore, we can use midpoint formula and obtain the following equation:\\begin{align*}\nx&=\\frac{(x_A+x_B)}{2}\\\\\n&=\\frac{(-2+x_B)}{2}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x_B&=2\n\\end{align*}\\begin{align*}\ny&=\\frac{(y_A+y_B)}{2}\\\\\n&=\\frac{1+y_B)}{2}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad y_B&=-4\n\\end{align*}In order to find $x_B+y_B$, we add $x_B$ and $y_B$.

Given that $A(-2, 1)$ is one endpoint and we can choose one coordinate (we take the $x$ coordinate) and add -2 to both sides, $x_2 = 2 - (-2) = 4$.\nUsing the same thing on $y_1 + y_2 = -12$, we can take one $y$ coordinate and add -1 to both sides.

Therefore, $x_1 + x_2 = 2$ and $y_1 + y_2 = -12$. Additionally, point $A(-2,1)$ is one endpoint of $\\overline{AB}$. Therefore, $x_1 = -2$ and $y_1 = 1$.
