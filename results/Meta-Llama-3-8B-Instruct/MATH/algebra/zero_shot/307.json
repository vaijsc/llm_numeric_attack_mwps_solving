        " \nLet's write the given equation as: \n$$x^2-6x+2=29$$\nNow, let's factor the LHS:\n$$x^2-6x+2=(x-a)(x-b)$$\nAnd comparing the coefficients of $x$ and the constant terms:\n$$(x-a)(x-b)=x^2-(a+b)x+ab$$\nSo, we can write:\n\\begin{align*}\na+b &=6 \\\\\nab &=2\n\\end{align*}\nSo, now we need to find $a$ and $b$. But before that, let\u2019s find a way to isolate $a$ or $b$.\nA useful trick is to notice that we can rearrange $(x-a)(x-b)$ to become:\n$$x^2-(a+b)x+ab=x^2+(b-a)x-ab$$\nNow we can take the equation $x^2-6x+2=29$ and subtract 29 from both sides. This will make the RHS become zero:\n$$x^2-6x-27=0$$\nNow we can solve this using the quadratic formula. This will give us two solutions for $x$, say $a$ and $b$. Let the quadratic formula give us:\n\\begin{align*}\nx &= \\frac{6\\pm\\sqrt{(-6)^2-4\\cdot1\\cdot(-27)}}{2} \\\\\nx &= \\frac{6\\pm\\sqrt{36+108}}{2} \\\\\nx &= \\frac{6\\pm\\sqrt{144}}{2} \\\\\nx &= \\frac{6\\pm12}{2} \\\\\nx &= 6\\pm6\n\\end{align*}\nSo, the solutions are $x_a=12$ and $x_b=0$. Plugging these into the factored equation, we have:\n$$(12-a)(0-b)=0\\cdot12+ab=2$$\nSo, we can substitute the values of $a$ and $b$:\n\\begin{align*}\n-12(0)+2 &=2 \\\\\n2 &=2\n\\end{align*}\nSo, we can confirm that our values of $a$ and $b$ solve the equation! And we already know what they are: $a=12$ and $b=0$.\nNow we can calculate $2a-3b$:\n$$2a-3b=2",

To factor the equation, we can first try to find the two roots that multiply to $b=31$.\n### Note: We can also think of it like finding two numbers who multiply to 31 and add to $a=-6$.\nSince $31=1\\cdot31=-6\\cdot(-5)$, we can factor the equation as$$(x+3)(x-5)=0,$$whose solutions are $x=-3$ and $x=5$.
