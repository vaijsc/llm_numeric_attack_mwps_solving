It is possible for us to create an  intuitive explanation of this complex problem.\nThe key point is that the numerator has $\\sqrt{5}+\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{5}-\\sqrt{2}$ in the denominator. When we rationalize a denominator, we need to find the lowest common denominator for both $\\sqrt{5}$ and $\\sqrt{2}$ which is $\\sqrt{10}$ (you have to know the square of this number).\nSo we multiply the numerator by $\\sqrt{5}+\\sqrt{2}$ as follows:\n    \\begin{align*}\n    \\frac{\\sqrt{5}+\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{5}-\\sqrt{2}} \n    &=\\frac{\\sqrt{5}+\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{5}-\\sqrt{2}} \n    \\cdot \\frac{\\left(\\sqrt{5}+\\sqrt{2}\\right)}{\\left(\\sqrt{5}+\\sqrt{2}\\right)}\\\\\n    &=\\frac{\\left(\\sqrt{5}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\sqrt{2}\\right)^2 + 2 \\sqrt{5} \\sqrt{2}}{\\left(\\sqrt{5}\\right)^2 - \\left(\\sqrt{2}\\right)^2}\\\\\n    &=\\frac{5 + 2 + 2 \\sqrt{10}}{5 - 2}\\\\\n    &=\\frac{7 + 2 \\sqrt{10}}{3}\\\\\n    &= \\frac{7}{3}+\\frac{2\\sqrt{10}}{3}\\\\\n\\end{align*}\nNow note that the term $\\frac{7}{3}$ has no square root and it\u2019s not necessary to rationalize, while the term $\\frac{2\\sqrt{10}}{3}$ must be rationalized. So, we multiply it by $\\sqrt{10}$ to rationalize it:\n    \\begin{align*}\n    \\frac{\\sqrt{5}+\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{5}-\\sqrt{2}} \n    &=\\frac{7}{3}+\\frac{2\\sqrt{10",

        " Start\nRationalize the denominator of $\\frac{\\sqrt{5}+\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{5}-\\sqrt{2}}$. We can begin by multiplying the numerator and denominator with $\\sqrt{5}+\\sqrt{2}$, giving\n$$\\frac{\\sqrt{5}+\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{5}-\\sqrt{2}}=\\frac{(\\sqrt{5}+\\sqrt{2})(\\sqrt{5}+\\sqrt{2})}{(\\sqrt{5}-\\sqrt{2})(\\sqrt{5}+\\sqrt{2})}=\\frac{(\\sqrt{5})^{2}+2\\sqrt{5}\\sqrt{2}+(\\sqrt{2})^{2}}{(5-2)}=\\frac{5+2\\sqrt{10}+2}{3}=\\frac{7+2\\sqrt{10}}{3}.$$\nThe answer can be written as $\\frac{A+B\\sqrt{C}}{D}$, where $A=7$, $B=2$, $C=10$, and $D=3$. Then, $A+B+C+D=7+2+10+3=\\boxed{22}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 22. I hope it is correct.",

This problem is listed as follows in the AoPS number theory textbook. The entire set of problems is as follows: Number Theory and Algebraic Geometry Problem Set - AoPS Online Books: \"I hope you will keep track of our books and continue to provide the quality problem sets. I have been using a lot of these problems as homework for my class. - Algebra notes: Problem Solving a being,lso be a tool for students to practice problem solving. Perhaps call it something like \"Number Theory and Algebraic Geometry\". Each problem is preceded by a tag such as \"algebra\", \"combinatorics\", to make it easier to find problems. \"\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 24. I hope it is correct.  Final Answer: The final answer is 24. I hope it is correct. Hints: We need to first simplify $\\frac{\\sqrt{5}+\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{5}-\\sqrt{2}}$ by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by $\\sqrt{5}+\\sqrt{"
