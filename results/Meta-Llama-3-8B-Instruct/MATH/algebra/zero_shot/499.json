        " \nStart with: The value of $\\log_{8}{2938}$ is between the consecutive integers $a$ and $b$.\nFind $a+b$.\n1. Recall that a logarithm in base $8$ can be represented by the equation $\\log_{8}{x}=\\frac{\\ln{x}}{\\ln{8}}=y$, where $y$ is the value of the equation. We want the value of $\\log_{8}{2938}$ to be between the consecutive integers $a$ and $b$.\n2. To do so, we have to find the possible values of $y$ (or $\\log_{8}{2938}$):\n$\\log_{8}8=1$\n$\\log_{8}64=2$\n$\\log_{8}512=3$\n$\\log_{8}4096=4$\n$\\cdots$\n3. We see that $2938$ is larger than $512$ and less than $4096$; therefore,\n$\\boxed{a=3}$\n$and$\n$\\boxed{b=4}$\nand $a+b=3+4=\\boxed{7}$.\nAnswer: The answer is 7.",
        " 2938=8^3+2=8^3+2\nNow that we have expressed 2938 as a multiple of 8 (to find $\\log_{8}{2938}$), we subtract 3 from the result, then this leaves us with 2. The digits of this single digit are between consecutive integers. 2938 is certainly more than $8^3=512$, and it is certainly less than $8^4=4096$, so the value of $\\log_{8}{2938}$ is between these consecutive integers.\n### Final Answer: The final answer is a+b=4.

        "  Pay attention to the numbers, the number represented in the log is $2938$. But it's represented in base $8$, but we just think of it as a base $10$ problem now.  Because the log ask us what power of base number to get a specific number. So we will consider the power of $8$ to get $2938$. We know $2 \\cdot 8 =16$, so $3$ times the base number $8$ gives us $3 \\cdot 8 =24$. $4 \\cdot 8 = 32$, $5 \\cdot 8 = 40$ so on, so you see that $8 \\cdot 369 = 2952$ and $8 \\cdot 369 + 8 = 2952 + 8 = 2960$ still not $2938$, but you can see that the number we are looking for is below $2952$ and this is what we will guess. We are finding the power of $8$ to give us the number. We guess $369.5$, but we don't have that, we have $369$. In that case, we can say that the $369^{th}$ power of $8$ minus $8$ gives us our number $2938$. So this gives us an equation of $8^{369} - 8 \\gt 2938$. We can write this as, $8^{369} \\gt 2946$. Now, we know that $8^{370} = 1073741824 \\GT 2946$. So, it's clear that $369 \\lt 370$, and we just need to check out $369$ and $370$. We found that $8^{369} - 8$ is not greater than $2946$ and $8^{370} - 8$ is greater than $2946$. So, the answer is $369$ and $370$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $369 + 370 = 739$. I hope it is correct.\n## Short description of the problem\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 739. I hope it is correct.  Please let me know if you have any question regarding this.

        " \nLet's think step by step.  We want to find an upper and lower bound for the value of $\\log_{8}{2938}$ so it is between consecutive integers. If you think about logarithms to different bases, you can represent $\\log_{8}{2938}=\\frac{\\log_{2}{2938}}{\\log_{2}{8}}$ where I used the change of base formula. (If you don't know this formula it's pretty easy to derive, so I won't do it here.) This means $a<\\log_{8}{2938}<b$ if $(a-1)<\\log_{2}{2938}<b$, i.e. if $2^{a-1}<2938<2^b$.  This is true if $2^{a-1}>2^3=8$ and $2^b<2^8=256$.  The smallest power of 2 that is greater than 8 is 2^4, so a lower bound is $a=5$.  The greatest power of 2 that is less than 256 is 2^7, so an upper bound is $b=7$.  Therefore, $a+b=\\boxed{12}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 12. I hope it is correct. ",
        " First, note that $\\log_{8}{2938}$ is positive because 2938 is greater than 1 and the logarithmic function is defined for positive real numbers.  Since we have to find the consecutive values of the logarithm in an interval, it is reasonable to try to find a perfect power of 8 between 1 and 2938. \nLet\u2019s start by saying that $2938=8^n$.  Solving for n, we can do: \n$$8^n=2938$$ \n$$\\begin{eqnarray}\n8^n&=&2\\cdot14\\cdot105\\cdot11\\\\ \n8^n&=&2^2\\cdot7\\cdot2\\cdot5\\cdot3\\cdot7\\cdot2\\cdot11\n\\end{eqnarray}$$\n$$8^n=2^{3}\\cdot2^{1}\\cdot5\\cdot3\\cdot7^2$$\n$$8^n=2^{3}\\cdot2^{1}\\cdot5\\cdot3\\cdot49$$\n$$8^n=2^{4}\\cdot5\\cdot3\\cdot49$$\n$$8^n=256\\cdot15\\cdot147$$\n$$8^n=256\\cdot15\\cdot3\\cdot49$$\n$$8^n=256\\cdot3\\cdot3\\cdot5\\cdot7\\cdot7$$\n$$n= log_{8}(256\\cdot3\\cdot3\\cdot5\\cdot7\\cdot7)$$\n$$n=log_{8}(2^{8})+log_{8}(3)+log_{8}(3)+log_{8}(5)+log_{8}(7)+log_{8}(7)$$\n$$n=8+log_{8}(243)+log_{8}(35)+log_{8}(49)$$\nSo it is clear that n becomes bigger and bigger, and thus it becomes a little greater than 9. Thus, we can input 8 < 8^n < 9, so $log_{8}(8^n)$ has a value between a and b. Evaluating this, we see that a = 9 - 1 = 8, and b = 9. Then, a+b = 8 + 9 = 17, and that is our answer. \nFinal Answer: The final answer is 17. I hope it is correct. \nLet\u2019s try to solve this for ourselves.\n### - Looks for Perfect Power of ",
        " Solution\nWe are given that $\\log_{8}{2938}$ is between the consecutive integers $a$ and $b$ . That means that $a<\\log_{8}{2938}<b$.\nSince $8^{a}=5 \\cdot 2^{3} < 1000 < 5 \\cdot 2^{4} = 8^{b+1},$ we know that $a<3<\\log_{8}{2938}<4$ or $3<\\log_{8}{2938}<4$.\nThus, $a+b=3+4=\\boxed{7}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 7. I hope it is correct.  It is possible to avoid the guess work heuristically by rewriting 2938 in exponential form.  We find \\begin{align*}\n2938&=2\\cdot 1469.  Since we know that $\\log_{k}{(2a)}=2\\log_{k}{a},$ this can be rewritten as $3+\\log_{8}{1469}=\\log_{8}{(8\\cdot 1469)}$ which, since $8\\cdot319=2560>2^{11},$ means that $\\log_{8}{2938}=3+\\log_{8}{1469}>3$.\nTherefore, we can set the constraint (a) $a<3<\\log_{8}{2938}\\Rightarrow a<3,\\log_{8}{2938}<4$, so that the constraints $2^a we apply the power rule for logarithms and we get \\begin{align*}\n&\\Rightarrow2^b=8^a <8^3=2^{9}<8^4=2^{12}.\n\\end{align*} That is, $8^a<2^{12}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 7.

Hence, \\begin{align*}8^{4}&=4096mouse-tracking-tool/what-are-read-only-environments_Inserted code\\\\&> \\log{2938}.\\\\  It follows that\\\\ 3guide-operators-and-scheduling&< k < 4free-code-camp-algo-challenges/algorithm-challenges for readmission.</aligned>Therefore,$$a+b=3+4=\\boxed{7}\\$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 7. I hope it is correct.  Hope it is correct.  The value of &\\log_8{2938}\\\\=k\nWe know that\\\\ 8^3&=512 \\\\ 3 < k < 4\\\\ Hence,$$a+b=3+4=\\boxed{7}\\$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 7. I hope it is correct. Final Answer: The final answer is 7. I hope it is correct.  ### Solution 4  We know that 3 &= \\log_{8}{512}new-classes-real-and-idealaddresses> log_8 2938,\\\\\\log_8{10000} &= 4 > \\log_8{2938};\\\\\\log_8{2938} &\\in ("
