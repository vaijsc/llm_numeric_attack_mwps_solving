        " A Student\u2019s Solution\nThe function $y=\\frac{x+1}{x^2-2x+1}$ has the form $\\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}$, with $p(x)=x+1$ and $q(x)=x^2-2x+1$. Hence, the domain of the function is $D=\\mathbb{R}-\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R} : q(x)=0\\}$. To find the values for which there is a vertical asymptote, we need to find the zeros of the polynomial $q(x)$. We have $q(x)=(x-1)^2$, so $q(x)=0$ if and only if $x=1$ or $x=1$ (in either case). Taking away these values from the domain, we find the values of $x$ where there is a vertical asymptote: $x \\in \\mathbb{R}-\\{1\\}=\\boxed{(-\\infty, 1) \\cup (1, \\infty)}$. This is because there are no vertical asymptotes apart from $x=1$.",

        " First, we can simplify the given function $$y=\\frac{x+1}{x^2-2x+1}$$ by combining like terms. $$y=\\frac{x+1}{x^2-2x+1}$$ $$y=\\frac{x+1}{(x-1)^2}$$ We can continue by checking for the zeros of the denominator, which will give us the $x$-values of the function where we can\u2019t evaluate.

When is $(x-1)(x-1)=0$? It\u2019s when either $x-1=0$ or $x-1=0$, so when $x=1$.

Now, you might want to try to factor a quadratic, but you will see that it is not easy. A good thing is that we can use the difference of squares trick. Try to factor the denominator, $x^2-2x+1$, into $(x-c_1)(x-c_2)$, where $c_1$ and $c_2$ are constants. We have\n\\begin{align*}\n(x-c_1)(x-c_2)&=x^2-2x+1\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\quad c_1c_2&=1\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\quad c_1&=1\\quad\\text{or}\\quad c_1=-1\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\quad c_2&=1\\quad\\text{or}\\quad c_2=-1.\n\\end{align*}If $c_1=1$ and $c_2=-1$, we get $(x-1)(x+1)=x^2-1$, which is not the same as $x^2-2x+1$. Therefore, we need to keep in mind that $c_1=-1$ and $c_2=-1$. Hence, we get\n\\begin{align*}\n(x-(-1))(x-(-1))&=x^2-2x+1\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\quad (x+1)^2&=x^2-2x+1\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\quad (x+1)^2-x^2&=-2x+1\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\quad x^2+2x+1-x^2&=-2x+1\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\quad 2x+1&=-2x+1\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\quad 4x&=0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\quad x&=0.\n\\end{align*}For simplicity, we can simplify $(x+1)^2=x^2+2x+1$ and $-2x+1$.\n### Step 2: Check\nFor our equation, $y=\\frac{x+1}{x^2-2x+1}$, we found that it factors into $(x+1)^2$.

        " Let\u2019s start by finding the possible vertical asymptotes of the equation $y=\\frac{x+1}{x^2-2x+1}$ first.\nThe denominator, which is $x^2-2x+1=(x-1)^2$, can never be equal to zero (only positive or zero). Thus, every vertical asymptote is found from the numerator by setting $x+1=0$, which means $x=-1$. This is our only possible vertical asymptote.",
        " First, observe that the given equation is really a function of two variables $y = f\\left( x \\right)$, as we have $y$ in the left-hand side and $x$ in the right-hand side. Therefore, we should set $y$ of a value of $x$ equal to infinity. This means that we are looking for $x$\u2019s that make the denominator of the function equal to zero.\n### Conclusion: So we need to solve for the zeros of the denominator $x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0$. Factor the quadratic, so the equation is $(x - 1)^2 = 0$ and $x - 1 = 0$ or $x = 1$. We have to find the value of $x$ that will cause the denominator to go to infinity. Because we need the denominator to be $0$, $x = 1$.\n### Conclusion: According to our problem, we have vertical asymptotes for the function at $x = 1$, and nowhere else, so the answer is $\\boxed{x = 1}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is x=1. I hope it is correct. Thank you. The given equation $y = \\frac{x+1}{x^2 - 2x + 1}$ is a function of two variables and we are asked to find the value(s) of $x$ for which there is a vertical asymptote. We can find the value(s) of $x$ by setting the denominator equal to zero and solving for $x$. So, let\u2019s set the denominator equal to zero, that is $x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0$. We can factor the quadratic to get $(x - 1)^2 = 0$. If $(x - 1)^2=0$, this means that $x - 1=0$ which implies that $x=1$. Therefore, we can conclude that there is a vertical asymptote at $x=\\boxed{1}$. Let\u2019s look at the graph of the equation to see if there are any asymptotes at other values of $x$.",

        " \nRecall that a level curve of a rational function (in our case $\\frac{x+1}{x^2-2x+1}$) has a vertical asymptote at a value $x_0$ where the denominator is $0$, i.e. $(x_0)^2-2x_0+1=0$.

Also, $y$ drops to $-\\infty$ as $x$ gets closer to $1$, which is an asymptote, because as $x$ gets closer to $1$, the numerator doesn\u2019t change sign while the denominator changes to $0$. Therefore, the $y$-values don\u2019t approach a limit as $x$ gets closer to $1$. The vertical asymptote is $x=\\boxed{1}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $x=1$.
