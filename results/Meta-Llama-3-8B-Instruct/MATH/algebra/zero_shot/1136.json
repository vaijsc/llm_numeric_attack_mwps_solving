        " The radius of a circle is equal to the distance between its center and a point on the circle. If the equation of the circle is $$x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0,$$ it means that its center is $(5, -3),$ since the center of a circle is located at the pivot of the circle. Then, to find the radius, we will place a point, say $(6, 0),$ on the circle and calculate the distance. We also know that the point $$(5, -3) = (x_0, y_0)$$ is the center of the circle.\n### Final Answer: The final answer is c=2. I hope it is correct.  In fact, if we expand the expression $$(x_0+x-(x_0+h))^2+(y_0+y-(y_0+k))^2$$ $$(x-x_0+h)^2+(y-y_0+k)^2$$ we get $$(x-(x_0+h))^2+(y-(y_0+k))^2 =x^2-2x(x_0+h)+(x_0+h)^2+y^2-2y(y_0+k)+(y_0+k)^2$$ $$(x^2-2x(x_0+h)+(x_0+h)^2)+(y^2-2y(y_0+k)+(y_0+k)^2 = (x-x_0+h)^2+(y-y_0+k)^2$$ That's why we have finally $$(x-x_0+h)^2+(y-y_0+k)^2 = (h)^2+(k)^2$$. It means, the distance between a point $(x_0+x-(x_0+h),(y_0+y-(y_0+k))$ on the circle and center $(x_0,y_0)$ of the circle is equal to $\\sqrt{(h)^2+(k)^2}$, or radii. In our case, $x_0 = 5, y_0 = -3, h = 1$ and $k = 0$. So the distance is $\\sqrt{(1)^2+(0)^2} = 1$. And for us, this distance will be $\\sqrt{(6-5)^2+0^2}$, or $\\sqrt{(1)^2+(0)^2}$.

        " \nWe need to find $c$ such that the circle has a radius of length $1$. We can accomplish this by putting our equation in the form of $(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$ and solve for $r$.\nWe can rewrite the equation in standard form as:\n\\begin{align*}\nx^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c&=0\\\\\nx^2 - 10x + 25 + y^2 + 6y + 9 + c - 25-9&=0\\\\\n(x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2&=c - 25-9\\\\\n(c - 34)&= (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2\\\\\nc - 34&= r^2\\\\\n\\end{align*}If we want the radius to be $1$ (i.e., $r = 1$), we get: \\begin{align*}\nc - 34&= 1\\\\\nc &= 35\n\\end{align*}Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{c = 35}$. We can plug $c = 35$ back into the equation to check if the circle indeed has a radius of $1$: \\begin{align*}\nx^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + 35&=0\\\\\n(x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2&=1\n\\end{align*}which is verified.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 35. I hope it is correct.ancoast\n#### Your ",
        " $c = 7$\nTo do this question, we will have to calculate the center of the circle first, then we will have to find the radius and then we have to find c.\nWe will get more easier, by completing the square.",
        " The radius of the circle is\n$$r=\\sqrt{\\left( \\frac{-b}{2} \\right)^2-\\left( \\frac{-a}{2} \\right)^2-\\frac{c}{4}}.$$In this case, we have $a = 1$, $b = -10$, $c = k$, and we want $r = 1$.  Therefore, we have to solve\\begin{align*}\n\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{-(-10)}{2}\\right)^2-\\left(\\frac{-1}{2}\\right)^2-\\frac{k}{4}}&=1\\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow \\qquad \\sqrt{25-\\frac{1}{4}-\\frac{k}{4}}&=1\\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow \\qquad 25-\\frac{1}{4}-\\frac{k}{4}&=1\\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow \\qquad \\frac{99-k}{4}&=1\\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow \\qquad 99-k&=4\\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow \\qquad k&=\\boxed{95}\n\\end{align*}\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 95.

        " \nLet's complete the square in both $x$ and $y$. We get \n$$(x - 5)^2 + y^2 + 6y + c - 25 = 0$$\n$$\\Rightarrow\\qquad (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 + c - 25 - 9 = 0$$\nLet $c - 34 = d$: \n$$\\Rightarrow\\qquad (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = d$$\nThe radius is given by $\\sqrt{d}$. The problem asks us to solve for $d = 1$. That is, $c - 34 = 1$, so $\\boxed{c = 35}$. We are essentially doing the same thing twice: one to the $x$, another to the $y$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 35. I hope it is correct.  Actually I'll check this question. The radius of the circle in the standard form is $\\sqrt{1^2 - \\bigg(\\frac{-10}{2}\\bigg)^2 + \\bigg(\\frac{6}{2}\\bigg)^2 - c}$. So solving for c we have: $1 = \\sqrt{1 - 25 + 9 - c} \\Rightarrow 1 = \\sqrt{-15 + c} \\Rightarrow \\boxed{c = 35}$\nTherefore, the answer is indeed 35. I am certain about this.
