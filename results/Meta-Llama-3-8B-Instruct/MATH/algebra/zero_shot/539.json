        " \nWe can rewrite $g^4+12g^2+9$ as $(g^2)^2+12g^2+9$.  Let\u2019s consider the equation $a^2+2ab+b^2=(a+b)^2$, a classic formula in algebra.  We can see that\n$$(g^2)^2+12g^2+9=(g^2+6g+3)^2,$$since $g^2+6g+3=g^2+2(3g)+3^2=(g+3)^2$.   So we have\n$$g^4+12g^2+9=c(g^2+6g+3)^2,$$where $c$ will be $1$ for now.  We can now solve for $c$: \n$$c(g^2+6g+3)^2=g^4+12g^2+9.$$Taking the square root of both sides (this is okay since all the terms have the same sign), we get\n$$c(g^2+6g+3)=\\pm\\sqrt{g^4+12g^2+9}.$$Noting that $c(g^2+6g+3)^2=g^4+12g^2+9$ applies to all values of $g$ (since it\u2019s a polynomial identity), we know that the left-hand side doesn\u2019t change sign, and therefore, we can compare the right-hand sides of both equations.  We know that $c(g^2+6g+3)^2=g^4+12g^2+9=c(g^2+6g+3)^2$, which yields\n$$g^4+12g^2+9=(\\pm\\sqrt{g^4+12g^2+9})^2,$$or\n$$g^4+12g^2+9=(\\pm(g^4+12g^2+9))$$where we use the fact that $a^2=|a|^2$, and in our case $a=\\sqrt{g^4+12g^2+9}$.  Canceling $g^4+12g^2+9$ on both sides and noting that we now have an equation in which both coefficients are possibly negative, we see that $c=\\boxed{1}$, and we have shown that\n$$g^4+12g^2",
        " c(g^2)(g^2+2p)+q\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 36. I hope it is correct.

What is $q$? $\\boxed{9}$ is $q$, not $36$. I write (c(g^2))(g^2+2p)+q in my book of rules but somehow didn\u2019t write it in my paper. Final Answer: The final answer is 9.

Original Answer can be obtained by using an Arithmetic Sequence An arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers in which each term after the first is obtained by adding a fixed constant to the previous term. If the first term is a1 , the common difference is d, and the sequence is an arithmetic sequence (a1, a2, a3, ... , an). $aexamples\\ = $\\ (a_1 , a_2 , ... , a_n), where$a_1$= a_1 , a_2$= a_1 + d , a_3$= a_1 + 2d , a_4$= a_1 + 3d , ... ,$an$= a_1 + (n \u2013 1)d. To simplify this, you can use$x$to denote the first term, and use Sharma\u2019s method. Sharma\u2019s method is longer, but it also works. Yeah, let\u2019s do this. The common difference, d, is the difference between any two consecutive terms of the series. Suppose you want to consider the second term, you should first add the first term of the series then add the constant to find the second term. It works in this case, because the second term has a different constant compared to the first term. Therefore, the second term$ a_2 $= a_1 + d$ becomes \"...+6\". Let's apply this to$ a_3 $=$ a_1 + 2d $.$a_4 $= a_1 + 3d$. Think of$ a_1 $as the first term, and$ a_2 $as the second term. This is how the series adds up.$ a_1, a_2,\\ ... $in$g^4 + 12g^2 + 9$, we have$\\ ...: g^4 + 12g^2 + 9$= $\\ ... $, g, +12",

Lagrange\u2019s Form of a Polynomial is a way to rewrite any quadratic expression as a sum of three squares in a very simple form. For more information, read the below Wikipedia Page:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange%27s_Form\nThis method involves splitting a quadratic expression, like $Ax^2+Bx+C$ in this case, into four parts, of which three consist of a square $(x-D)^2$ and the fourth consists of $E$, where $D$ and $E$ are given in relevant terms in the expression.\nFor example, let $Q(x)=Ax^2+Bx+C$ be a quadratic expression, then in Lagrange\u2019s Form we can express Q(x) in an alternative way. Specifically,\n$$Q(x) = A(x^2 + (B/A - 2D)x + D^2 + E/A),$$\nwhere\n$$D = \\sqrt{(B^2-4AC)/4A},$$\n$$E=AC-B^2/4.$$\nUsing this, it is easy to calculate any value of the polynomial in one input.\nNow we can calculate $c(g^2 + p)^2 + q$ using Lagrange\u2019s Form: $f(g^2) = g^4+12g^2+9$. We know that the leading term is $g^4$, the middle term is $12g^2$, and the constant term is $9$. The Lagrange\u2019s Form in this case is\n$g^4+12g^2+9=A(g^2+(\\frac{1}{2}B/A)x+(B^2-4AC)/4A)+9$ which is an alternative, simplified form of the polynomial.\nBy comparing the two equations we obtain: $A=1$, $B=A$, $C=9$. Since $B/A = 1$ and $A = 1$, we see that $D = B/A - 2(1) = 1$, and that $E = AC =",
