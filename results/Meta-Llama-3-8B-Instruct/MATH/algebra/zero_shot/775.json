Let\u2019s try to solve this linear system step by step. We need to find $x$ and $y$. Step 1: write down the given equations\n\\begin{align*}\n5x-2y&=7,\\\\\n3x+y&=2\n\\end{align",
        " We have two equations here. If our system is\n\\begin{align*}\nax+by&=c,\\\\\ndx+ey&=g,\n\\end{align*}then the solution (x, y) satisfies $ax+by=c$ and $dx+ey=g$.  So let\u2019s find the solution to this system and compute $24x-14y$ afterwards, by plugging in in the solution.  Let $(x_0, y_0)$ be the solution.  Then $5x_0-2y_0=7$ and $3x_0+y_0=2$, or \\begin{align*}\n5x_0-2y_0&=7,\\\\\n3x_0+y_0&=2.\n\\end{align*}Let\u2019s solve for $y_0$. From the second equation, we see $y_0=-3x_0+2$.  Plugging this into the first equation, we have \\begin{align*}\n5x_0-2(-3x_0+2)&=7\\\\\n&= 5x_0+6x_0-4\\\\\n&=11x_0-4\\\\\n&\\Rightarrow\\qquad 11x_0=11\\\\\n&\\Rightarrow\\qquad x_0=1\n\\end{align*}Plugging $x_0=1$ into $y_0=-3x_0+2$ yields $y_0=-3+2=-1$.  So, our solution is $(x_0, y_0)=(1, -1)$.  Hence $$24x-14y=24(1)-14(-1)=\\boxed{38}.$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 38. I hope it is correct.uegos\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 38.
