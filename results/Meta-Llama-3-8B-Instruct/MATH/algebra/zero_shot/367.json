    "solution": "The shortest line from the point $(6,0)$ to the given line will be perpendicular to it.  A line perpendicular to $y=2x-2$ will have a slope of $-1/2$.  This will give it a form of $y=-\\frac{1}{2}x+b$.  Substituting the point $(6,0)$ that we know must lie on this line, we find: $$0=-\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 6 +b$$ $$3=b$$ The equation of the perpendicular line is $y=-\\frac{1}{2}x+3$.  Now, we can solve for the point where the two lines intersect: $$-\\frac{1}{2}x+3=2x-2$$ $$5=\\frac{5}{2}x$$ $$x=2$$ Plugging into either line, we find the point of intersection is $(2,2)$.

        " First, we find the $y$-value of the point. $y = 0$. Plugging in 0 for $y$ and $6$ for $x$ in the equation $y = 2x - 2$, we find that $0 = 2 \\cdot 6 - 2 = 12 - 2 = 10$. This doesn\u2019t make sense. The point is not actually on the line. The shortest distance from a point to a line is the perpendicular distance, which can be found using the formula $\\frac{|d|}{|d|/2}$ where $d$ is the distance between the point and the line. Another way to find the distance between a point $(x_1,y_1)$ and a line $y = mx + c$ is by using the equation $\\frac{|d|}{\\sqrt{1+m^2}} = |x_1 - \\frac{2xm_1 + c}{1+m^2}|$. Expanding the equation above for $d$, we obtain $\\frac{\\left|y_1 - mx_1-c\\right|}{\\sqrt{1+m^2}} = |x_1 - \\frac{2xm_1 + c}{1+m^2}|$. For our problem, the line is given by $y = 2x-2$. The $x$-value of our point is 6, and the $y$-value of our point is $0$. The line is also in slope-intercept form, so $m = 2$ is the slope.

        " $\\sqrt{62}$\nAs I know that the shortest distance from point to a line is along the line that connects the point to the line, i.e., perpendicular to it. Using this idea, we find that we can draw a line from the point (6,0) to line y = 2x - 2. Now we find coordinates of this line as when we solve the equation y = 2x - 2 , we get y = 2x - 2. For x = 0, we find that y = -2. So, (0, -2) is the first coordinate of our line. As the distance from (0, -2) to (6,0) is $\\sqrt{6^2+2^2}=\\sqrt{40}$  and we know that it is a perpendicular distance and is the shortest distance, therefore this is our required answer.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\sqrt{62}$.

        " In most cases, mathematicians need to find the length of the shortest line segment that connects a point and a function before we can solve this question. Because there is only one mathematical way to approach the line from the point. So, we need to start with the length of the shortest line segment. In this case, we can imagine there is a green line exending from the point (6,0) that extends as far as it can in a straight line without intersecting the line `y=2x-2`. The green line is our shortest line because it expresses the most concise length.\nWhen you try to find the distance, you can think about the distance formula, which is squared and is expressed as: $$d^2 = (x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2$$ In this case, the green line will be the perpendicular line with respect to the horizontal y-axis. Therefore, $$x_2$$ will represent the x-coordinate of the green line, where we will find the shortest distance. It should be `y=2x-2` when the green line intersects `y=2x-2`. This means $$y_2$$ will simply be `2x-2`, as per the equation \u201cy=2x-2\u201d. Then, we can calculate $$x_2$$ using this function $$x_2 = \\frac{2y_2+2}{2} = \\frac{2(2x-2)+2}{2} = x.$$\nSo we have `x2` and `y2` values. By putting these into the distance formula, we can find the Green Line-like distance. But keep in mind that we don\u2019t want the distance to the green line yet, but we want the distance between the original point and `y=2x-2`.\nIn order to get the shortest distance between (6,0) and `y=2x-2`, we should use the same distance formula but subtract `x2` value from `x1` (6), and subtract `y2` value from `y1` (0). So, `y1=(2*6)-2=10` and `x1=6.`\nThe distance formula then becomes: $$d = \\sqrt{(6 - x)^2 + (0 - (2x - 2))^2}$$ Now, this distance is less than the original distance formula we found because in order to get the shortest",

We can set the two expressions equal to each other and solve for x:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sqrt{(x-6)^2+y^2} &= |2x-2-y|\\\\\n(x-6)^2+y^2 &= |2x-2-y|^2\n\\end{align*}\nExpand $|2x-2-y|^2$ and simplify:\n\\begin{align*}\n(x-6)^2+y^2 &= (2x-2-y)^2\\\\\n(x-6)^2+y^2 &= (2x-2)^2-4y+4y-4y^2\\\\\n&= 4x^2-8x+4\\\\\n&= 4(x-1)^2\n\\end{align*}\nNow, we get $4(x-1)^2 = (x-6)^2+y^2$, or $(x-1)^2 = \\left(\\frac{(x-6)}{\\sqrt{4}}\\right)^2+\\frac{y^2}{4}$.
