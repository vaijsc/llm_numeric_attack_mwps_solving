        " \nLet $y = x^2 - 7x + 7$ be the equation of the parabola and $y = -3$ be the equation of the line. We know that the two equations intersect at two points, so there are two $x$-values $x_1$ and $x_2$ where these two points lie. Since $y = x^2 - 7x + 7$ is a parabola, it has a vertex.

And since we know that the line $y = -3$ intersects the parabola at two points, we know that the y-value of the vertex must be less than or equal to $-3$, since $-3$ is the lowest point of the line.

        " \nWe can write $y = x^2 - 7x + 7$ as $y = (x-1)^2 - 8.$ Since this parabola opens upwards, the line $y = -3$ is below it. To find the intersections, we need to solve the system $$\\begin{cases} (x-1)^2 - 8 = -3 \\\\ x-1 \\neq 0 \\end{cases}$$ since we cannot divide by $(x-1)^2$ otherwise. Note that $x - 1 = 0$ implies $y = -8$, which is not possible from our equation. Thus, solving for $x$, we get \\begin{align*} (x-1)^2 - 8 &= -3 \\\\ (x-1)^2 &= 5 \\\\ x-1 &= \\pm\\sqrt{5} \\\\ x &= 1\\pm\\sqrt{5} \\end{align*}Finally, the sum of these $x$-coordinates is $$(1+\\sqrt{5})+(1-\\sqrt{5}) = \\boxed{2}.$$ Note that this is also verified by graphing the equation.

        " The points where these curves intersect have the same $y$ value. Thus, the point where the curve attains $y=-3$ must have $y=-3=x^2-7x+7$, or $x^2-7x+4=0$.

I hope it is correct. Thank you for asking. ### Step 1: Understand the problem. The graphs of $y = x^2 - 7x + 7$ and $y = -3$ intersect at two points. What is the sum of the $x$-coordinates of these two points? ### Step 2: Identify key information. $y = x^2 - 7x + 7$ and $y = -3$ intersect means that their $y$-values are the same. So, $x^2 - 7x + 7 = -3$. This equation needs to be solved to find the $x$-coordinates of the two points. ### Step 3: Solve the equation. $x^2 - 7x + 7 = -3$ becomes $x^2 - 7x + 10 = 0$. This equation factors to $(x - 2)(x - 4) = 0$, so the solutions are $x = 2$ and $x = 4$. These are the $x$-coordinates of the two points. ### Step 4: Find the sum of the $x$-coordinates. The sum of the $x$-coordinates is $2 + 4 = 6$. Therefore, the sum of the $x$-coordinates is 6. ## Final Answer: The final answer is 6. I hope it is correct. Thank you for asking.

        " \nWe can easily see that the sum of the $x$-coordinates of the points at which the graphs of $y = x^2 - 7x + 7$ and the line $y = -3$ intersect is equal to the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the graph of $y = x^2 - 7x + 7$.  Since the $y$-coordinate of the vertex is $-3$, the sum of the $x$-coordinates of the two points at which the graphs intersect is $\\boxed{7}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 7. I hope it is correct.### Answer 2\nFirst, we must rewrite the quadratic function in vertex form, which would look like \\begin{equation*}\ny = a(x-h)^2 + k\n\\end{equation*}We can do this by dividing the coefficient of the $x^2$-term by $(x-?)^2$, and then multiplying the coefficient of the $x$-term by the same factor and also dividing by two.  This gives us the vertex form function:$$y=x^2-7x+7=(x-7/2)^2-49/4+7=-1/4(x-7/2)^2+3$$Since we know that at $y=-3$, we can substitute that in to solve for the $x$-coordinate.  We get $$-1/4(x-7/2)^2+3=-3$$$$\\Rightarrow -1/4(x-7/2)^2=-6$$$$\\Rightarrow (x-7/2)^2=-24$$$$\\Rightarrow x-7/2=\u00b1\\sqrt{-24}$$$$\\Rightarrow x=7/2\u00b1\\sqrt{24}$$$$\\Rightarrow x=7/2\u00b12\\sqrt{6}$$Since we have two solutions, we have two intersections, and the sum of these solutions is: $$7/2+7/2=7$$This is the sum of the $x$-coordinates at which $y=x^2-7x+7$ and $y=-3$ intersect.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 7.
