        " \nSince we\u2019re solving the equation $\\frac{9-4x}{x+6}=7$ for $x$, we need to isolate $x$. \nWe begin by multiplying both sides by $x+6$, which is the reciprocal of $x+6$. So, we have \n$\\dfrac{9-4x}{x+6}=7$\n$(x+6)(9-4x)=7(x+6)$ \nand distributing $(x+6)$ to the right and left:\n$9x-4x^2-6=7x+42$ \nThen add $4x^2$ to both sides:\n$-4x^2+9x-6=7x+42$\nSubtract $7x$ from both sides:\n$-4x^2+2x-6=42$\nSubtract $42$ from both sides:\n$-4x^2+2x-48=0$\nFactor $-4x^2+2x-48$, the left side:\n$-(4x+12)(x-4)=0$\nSo, the equation has $x=-3$ and $x=4$ as solutions. However, since $x+6$ is a factor in the equation, we know that $x+6=0$, which gives $x=-6$ is also a solution. So, we have $x=-3,$ $x=-6$, and $x=4$ as our three solutions. Since the problem asks for a single solution, we choose the solution that is a real number, which is $x=\\boxed{4}$. \nFinal Answer: The final answer is 4. I hope it is correct.  Learned a lot from this problem.  The problem made me realize that the equation should have 2 terms.  In this case  $(x+6)$ is a term in both the numerator and the denominator of the equation because the problem asked us to solve for $x$.  Therefore, $x+6=0$ gives us another solution.  Another thing I learned is that we should never give up until we have 3 groups of three solutions: the roots of the numerator's factor, the roots of the denominator's factor and the roots of the entire equation.  I hope this helps others.  Thank you. \n### Note: \nFor each step of the solution, it would be helpful to explain briefly in a Comment section below, what the advantage",

        " We know that\n%.\n### Explanation:\nWe can take the denominator (x+6) to the other side and we get x+6 = \\frac{9-4x}{7} . We can solve this equation. Subtracting 6 from both sides, we get x = \\frac{9-4x}{7}-6 . Now we multiply everything by 7 to remove the fraction: 7x = 9-4x-42. This is the same as: 7x+4x = 9-42. Combining like terms gives us: 11x = -33. Finally we divide both sides by 11 to get x = -33/11 .\n### Step-by-step Solution:\nStep 1: Divide both sides by 9-4x to eliminate the fraction.\nStep 2: Combine like terms on the left-hand side and simplify.\nStep 3: Solve for x.\nWhen you're done, add tags for any problem types this solution covers.

        " We solve this equation step by step.\nFirst, we want to get rid of the fraction. To do this, we can get a common denominator of $x+6$, which is $1$:\n$$\\frac{9-4x}{x+6}=7\\Rightarrow 9-4x=(x+6)\\times 7.$$Now, multiply everything by $x+6$:\n$$9-4x=7x+42\\Rightarrow -5x=33\\Rightarrow \\boxed{x=-\\frac{33}{5}}.$$\n### Solution Explanation:\nThe key to this problem is that we want to get rid of the fraction right away. We did this by reducing the fraction to $9 - 4x$ = $(x + 6)\\times 7$. We then multiplied both sides by $(x + 6)$, which gave us a linear equation that was easy to solve.
