        " The first thing we can do is isolate x in terms of y. Since $\\displaystyle\\frac{x}{y} = 3$, then $x=3y$. Next we do the same thing with y in terms of z. Since $\\displaystyle\\frac{y}{z} = 8$, then $y=8z$. Now substitute this into the equation $x=3y$ in order to isolate x in terms of z. This gives $x=3(8z)=24z$. Now simplify the last equation above into $\\displaystyle\\frac{z}{w} = \\frac{1}{2}$. Simplifying gives $z=\\frac{1}{2}w$, or $w = 2z$. Now substitute this into the equation $x=24z$ in order to isolate x in terms of w. This gives $x=24z = 24\\left(\\frac{1}{2}w\\right)=12w$. Now simplify the last equation above to give us the solution $x=w\\left(6\\right).$ Now we can go ahead and find $\\displaystyle\\frac{w}{x}.$ Since $x=6w$, then $\\displaystyle\\frac{w}{x} = \\frac{w}{6w}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\frac{1}{6}. I hope it is correct. Norton Chapman has the final answer. $\\displaystyle\\frac{x}{y} = 3$, $\\displaystyle\\frac{y}{z} = 8$, and $\\displaystyle \\frac{z}{w} = \\frac{1}{2}$, then what is $\\displaystyle\\frac{w}{x}$? We can do this step by step. First, we can do x in terms of y. Since $\\displaystyle\\frac{x}{y} = 3$, or $x=3y$, next we can do the same thing with y in terms of z. This gives $y=8z$, so substitute this into $x=3y$ to give $x=3(8z)=24z$. Next we can simplify this equation with the equation $\\displaystyle\\frac{z}{w} = \\frac{1}{2}$, which simplifies to $z=\\frac{1}{2}w$ or $w=2z$. Now, substitute this into $x=24z",
        " We will use the fact that $\\displaystyle\\frac{z^2}{yw}=\\frac{1}{2}$ to solve the problem.\nSince $\\displaystyle\\frac{z^2}{yw}=\\frac{1}{2}$, so $\\displaystyle\\frac{z^2}{8yw}=\\frac{1}{16}$.\n### Step1: Simplification\nWe know that $\\displaystyle\\frac{x}{y}=3$ and $\\displaystyle\\frac{y}{z}=8$. Hence, $\\displaystyle\\frac{xz}{yw}=24$.\n### Step2: Equivalence\nDivide both sides of $\\displaystyle\\frac{xz}{yw}=24$ by $\\displaystyle\\frac{z^2}{yw}$.\nThen, $\\displaystyle\\frac{xz}{yw}\\div \\frac{z^2}{yw}=\\frac{24}{1}$. Now, we know that $\\displaystyle\\frac{z^2}{yw}=\\frac{1}{2}$. Then, we have $\\displaystyle\\frac{24}{1}=\\frac{12}{\\frac{1}{2}}$.\n### Step3: Simplification\nNow, multiply both sides by $\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{2}$.\nThen, $\\displaystyle\\frac{w}{x}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$.\nThe answer is $\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{6}$.\n## A full explanation:\nStep 1. There is nothing wrong with step 1.\nStep 2. He mentioned Simplification and Equivalence. Can we further explain what that means?\nWhen he did this:\n$\\displaystyle\\frac{xz}{yw}\\div \\frac{z^2}{yw}=\\frac{24}{1}$,\nhe meant:\n $\\displaystyle \\frac{xz}{yw}\\div \\frac{z^2}{yw} = \\frac{\\frac{xz}{yw}}{\\frac{z^2}{yw}} = \\frac{24}{1}.$\nSo, there is nothing wrong with this\nSo, the last step ($\\frac{24}{1}=\\frac{12}{\\frac{1}{2}}$) reflects simplification. He multiplied by the reciprocal ($\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2$)\nStep 3. There\u2019s nothing wrong with this. He could have also used$\\displaystyle\\frac{",
