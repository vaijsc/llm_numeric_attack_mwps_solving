We can add more problems but we want to work on this one first.\nThe Disk Method is used to compute the area under a curve $$f(x)$$ bounded by some interval $$[a, b]$$. This method involves dividing the area under the curve into thin disks of width $$dx$$ and then summing up the areas of these disks to get the total area.\nTo find the area under $$f(x) = x^2 + \\frac{x^3}{3}$$ over the interval $$[0, 4]$$, we first let $$\\pi r^2$$ denote the area of one of these thin disks.  In this case, we can see that the radius of the disk is the value of $$f(x)$$ at a given point on the interval $$[0, 4]$$, and the thickness of the disk is $$dx$$.  Therefore, the area of the disk is $$\\pi [x^2 + \\frac{x^3}{3}]^2 dx$$.\nTo find the total area under the curve, we need to sum up all of these thin disks.  One way to do this is to integrate the function $$f(x)$$.  This is equivalent to summing up the areas of all of",

I hope it is correct.()+AThis is an example of a problem that relates to finance and economics. It requires a student to understand the concept of compounding and to calculate the interest earned on an investment. The problem also requires the student to be able to round their answer to the nearest cent, which can be a challenging task. The instructions provided are clear and concise, making it easy for the student to understand what is being asked of them. The problem itself is easy to solve, but it still requires some mathematical knowledge and understanding of the concept of compounding. An alternative solution could be: Let's calculate the total interest earned in two years by multiplying the principal by the interest rate (r) by number of times the interest is compounded (n), and then subtracting the principal from the total. [latex]Interest = P \\times r \\times (1 + r)^n - P[/latex]Here, P is the principal (10,000), r is the interest rate (4.5%), and n is the number of times the interest is compounded (1, since it's compounded annually). Plugging in the values, we get: [latex]Interest = 10,000 \\times 0.045 \\times (1 + 0.045)^1 - 10,000 = 919.23[/latex]This agrees with our previous calculation. So, the total interest earned is approximately 919.23. You could also solve this problem by using a calculator to find the future value of an investment. The formula for this is: [latex]F = P * (1 + r)^n[/latex]Here, F is the future value, P is the principal, r is the interest rate, and n is the number of",
        " At the end of the first year, the interest is \\begin{align*} 0.045(10,000)&=450, \\end{align*}and the principal is now$10,000+450=\\10,450$. At the end of the second year, again the interest is \\begin{align*} 0.045(10,450)&=470.25, \\end{align*}and the principal is now \\begin{align*} 10,450+470.25&=10,920.25. \\end{align*}The interest earned over two years is the interest earned in the second year, which is \\begin{align*} 470.25, \\end{align*}and the interest earned in the first year, which is \\begin{align*} 450. \\end{align*}Therefore, the total interest earned is$\\boxed{470.25+450.00=920.25}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is$920.25. I hope it is correct. ### Why is the formula 0.045(10,000)? We can understand the formula 0.045(10,000) by considering the formula 10,000 x 4.5/100. Here, the numerator 100 is being reduced to remove the percentage sign. Why are we reducing the numerator in this case? If we reduce the numerator by a factor of 100 in our expression here, it is the same as multiplying by a factor of 100 on the denominator. (When we multiply numbers by reciprocals, the reciprocals cancel. So, 100/100 remains 1. So, it is the same as multiplying.) The meaning of the formula becomes clearer: it is equivalent to saying we take the principal amount $10,000$ and find $4.5\\%$ of that amount. The $4.5\\%$ in the expression is the denominator of the fraction $\\frac{4.5}{100},$ and this denominators are being lifted from the expression by multiplying with a factor that is contained in it, whereas the numerator $10,000$ is the component that we are interested in. Therefore, the formula $0.045(10,000)$ states multiplication of the principal amount by the interest rate expressed as a decimal: $0.045(10,000) \\equiv 4.5/100 \\times 10,000.$",
        " The deposit is $10,000 which will increase by$400 (which is 10,000 * 0.45) every year. Since this is happening for 2 years we have to multiply $400 * 2$ = 800. So added interest will be 10,000 + 800 = $10,800.  Since we need to get the interest amount, we subtract the initial deposit from the total deposit, which is$10800 - 10000 = \\$800. So, in two years we earn $\\$$800 in interest. Final Answer: The final answer is 800. I hope it is correct. 80\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 800.

Click to expand... #### Solution We start with a principal amount of $\\$$10,000$ after one year of compounding, we have$\\$$10,000(1+0.045)$ because the interest rate is $45\\%$ per year. Notice we use $0.045$ instead of $\\frac{45}{100}$ because we have to multiply the principal amount, $10,000$, by the annual interest rate. Therefore, after one year of compounding, we will have$\\$$10,455$ because $10,000(1+0.045)=10,455.$ We set this final amount as our principal amount for next year of compounding. Now, after two years of compounding, we have $\\$$10,455(1+0.045)$ by the same reasoning above. Expanding the parentheses, we get$\\$$10,455+0.045(10,455)=4546.755.$ Now, to find the interest we need to subtract the principal amount from the final amount,$\\$$10,000\\$. We get $4546.755-10,000=\\boxed{\\452.56}$.  So, we earn$\\$$452.56$ as the interest over a period of two years. For our required amount of the interest earned in two years, the final answer is $\\$$452.56$ by definition. Final Answer: The final answer is 452.56. I hope it is correct.  453} Final Answer: The final answer is 452.56. I hope it is correct. We have the following amount after two years, $A = 10,000 (1+0.045)^2 = 10556.755`, which is also equal to $10,000 + 452.56$ interest, because because$A = P (1+0.045)^2$, where $P$ is the initial principal amount. So, the interest earned is $\\$$452.56.$ \\\\ The formula to calculate the amount after a certain number of periods is:A = P (1+r)^n A = 10,000 x (1+0.045)^2 = 10556.755\\\\ Final Answer: The final answer is 452.56. I hope it is correct.  Final Answer: The final answer is 452.56. I hope it is",
        " The interest is (10,000)(4.5/100)=450$.  And the interest for the second year is (10,000 + 450)(4.5/100) = 4,047.5\\$.  Thus, the total interest earned is 450 + 4,047.5 = 4,497.5$.",
        " Annual interest rate without compounding:\nAnnual interest rate is the same as 4.5% = 0.045, which means that the annual interest earned on a deposit of $$10,000 is equal to \\(0.045\\,\\cdot\\,10,000=450.000~~$ (dollars).  Now we have to account for the fact that this interest is NOT compounded, and is actually taken out once a year. So while the actual interest earned is $$450.000, the money will be compounded and earn $$450.000$$, which is $$450000+450.000 = 450450$ in interest, for the second year.  Over 2 years, we earn $$450.000 + 450450 = 900450.000~~$ (dollars).\n### Final Answer: The final answer is 900.45. I hope it is correct. For simplicity, Hanlon provides an approximate solution. In reality, the interest earned will be lower since it is compounded. You want to find out the total interest earned in two years with a principal of 10,000 and an interest rate of 4.5% per year, compounded annually.\n### Alternative method:\nUse the formula for compound interest calculation (A=\\(P\\times (1 + r)^{n})$ to find the value at the end of the two years.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 904.11. I hope it is correct. If you\u2019re still uncertain about investing, refer to our guide for How to Invest in the Stock Market. The first year, you will earn a return of 4.5% of your original principal, so you will have a total of $10,000 + 10,000\\times0.045 = 10,450.$ Now, the interest rate of 4.5% will be applied to the new principal balance, $10,450,$ and you will earn another 4.5%, so the final balance will be $10,450+\\left(10,450\\times0.045\\right)=10,996.25.$ Then you can calculate the interest earned in two years to be $10,996.25-10,000=996.25.$\n### Disclaimer:\nThe material on this site is for informational purposes only and should not be considered as investment advice.

Our principal is now $\\$$11,450 Interest so far=Principal*rate = $11,450*0.045 = $514.75$Finally, we add this interest to the $11,450$. $\\$$11,450+514.75=\\$11,964.75 \nThere are a total of $\\$$11,964.75 in our amount at the end of the two-year period. Subtracting our initial deposit, we have earned $\\$\\boxed{9,964.75}$in interest over the period of the two-year $$#### Final Answer: The final answer is \\$$9,964.75$.

        " Final answer: The final answer is $450. I hope it is correct.\nIn this problem, we are looking for the interest earned after 2 years from $\\$$10,000 deposited at 4.5$\\%$compounded annually. Let's calculate this step by step:\n1. Interest earned in the first year:\n\\begin{align*}Interest &= Amount\\cdot Rate\\cdot Time\\\\\n&= 10000\\cdot0.045\\cdot1\\\\\n&= 450\\\\\n\\end{align*}The amount at the end of the first year is: 10000 + 450 = 10450\n2. Interest earned in the second year:\nThe amount to which we apply the rate is now 10450. Hence,\n\\begin{align*}Interest &= Amount\\cdot Rate\\cdot Time\\\\\n&= 10450\\cdot0.045\\cdot1\\\\\n&= 470.25\\\\\n\\end{align*}The total interest earned in two years is 450 + 470.25 = 920.25. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{\\$920.25}.]\nURL:\n/changes/preview&token=T..."
