When you simplify expressions involving parentheses there are things we can do first compared to if there were no parentheses. The order of operations is important. If there is a parenthesis we should follow the order and simplify inside the parenthesis first before simplifying outside of the parentheses. Enjoy. Enjoy learning and applying math.

I am here to help you. Enjoy learning and applying math. WHEN YOU SEE PARENTHESES, WAIT! (*) Students: When you see parentheses in an expression, do not ignore them. Instead, think of them as \"closures\" that need to be evaluated first before moving on to the rest of the expression. Follow the order of operations (PEMDAS) and evaluate everything inside the parentheses before simplifying the rest of the expression. Enjoy. Enjoy learning and applying math.  (When we work with these kinds of problems, we might need to use the distributive law. It is an important tool for simplifying expressions involving parentheses.) The answer is 6.
