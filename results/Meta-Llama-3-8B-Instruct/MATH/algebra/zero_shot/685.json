Note: The $h$ and $k$ could have been read immediately from $\\require{cancel} 3\\left((x+\\cancel{\\dfrac{1}{6}})^2 \\cancel{- \\dfrac{1}{9}} -\\dfrac{4}{3}\\right)$, and $3(\\cdots)^2 + k = 3(\\cdots)^2 + \\cancel{(-\\dfrac{5}{3})}$.\nAlternatively, we can do a pretty neat trick using synthetic division by the zero $x=\\frac{1}{6}$ of $3x^2+x-4$ to eliminate the constant term and get the $h^2$ term of the desired form, then manually add back the eliminated constant term and the eliminated $h^2$ term to get the constant term, and then multiply by the leading coefficient:\n$\\begin{array}{ccccc}\n &= \\left|\\begin{array}{ccccc}\n3 & 0 & -1 & \\frac{1}{6}\\\\\n& 3 & 3 & \\\\\n0 & 0 & -2 & & \\\\\n& 0 & 2 & \\frac{5}{3} & \\\\\n& 3 & 5 & \\frac{1}{6} \\\\\n& 0 & & 0 & \\frac{5}{3}\n\\end{array}\\right|\\\\\n& \\overset{\\text{eliminated}}{\\boxed{\\frac{3}{9}a}} \\\\\nx &= \\frac{1}{6} \\\\\n& 0 \\nonumber",

Of course, all of this is too complicated. There is another way, an easier and more direct way. Let $f(x)=a(x-h)^2+k$. It\u2019s simply possible to calculate the value of $f(-\\frac{1}{3})$.\nUsing the formula $f(-\\frac{1}{3})=\\boxed{-4}$ means the final answer: $$k=-4$$. I hope it is correct. This problem can be shortened to calculate $(x-\\frac{1}{3})^2$ and to subtract it from $a(x-\\frac{1}{3})^2+k$.\nLet $x=0$: $$f(0)=3(0)^2+0-4=-4.$$Then plug it infinitely. Let\u2019s plug $x=0$ into the polynomial $f(x)=3x^2+x-4$.\nSo we can have: $$f(x)=3x^2+x-4=3(x^2+\\frac{1}{3}x)-4=3(x^2+\\frac{1}{3}x+\\frac{1}{9}-\\frac{1}{9})-4=3(x+\\frac{1}{3})^2-\\frac{5}{3}.$$\nLet\u2019s simply calculate the value using it.

        " Since we know $x$ is to the second power in the expression $3x^2 + x - 4$, we know $(x - h)^2$ will appear in the expression. Therefore, we have\n$$3x^2 + x - 4 = 3(x - h)^2 + k$$\nNow, let\u2019s find $h$ and $k$ by comparing the coefficients. First, the coefficient of $x^2$ is 3 in both expressions.
