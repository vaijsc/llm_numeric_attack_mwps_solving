    "solution": "The vertex form of a parabolic equation is $y=a(x-h)^2+k$. Since we are given that the vertex is at $(2,1)$, we know that $h=2$ and $k=1$. Plugging that into our equation gives $y=a(x-2)^2+1$. Now, substituting the other given point $(-4,-3)$ into the equation to solve for $a$, we have  \\begin{align*}\n-3&=a(-4-2)^2+1\\\\\n-4&=a(-6)^2\\\\\n-4&=36a\\\\\n-\\frac{1}{9}&=a\n\\end{align*} So the equation for the graphed parabola is $y=-\\frac{1}{9}(x-2)^2+1$. The zeros of the quadratic occur when $y=0$, so plugging that value into the equation to solve for $x$, we have $0=-\\frac{1}{9}(x-2)^2+1 \\Rightarrow (x-2)^2=9$. Taking the square root of both sides yields $x-2=\\pm 3$, so $x=5$ or $x=-1$. Thus, $m=5$ and $n=-1$, so $m-n=5-(-1)=\\boxed{6}$.",

        "  Weston_ST over at AoPS. Weston_ST: This solution is quite straight-forward, and it doesn't require much thinking.  I'm sure I can help you out! First, let's look at the given parabola. We know the vertex is $(2,1)$.  This means $y=a(x-2)^2+1$.  This leads us to $ax^2-4ax+2a+1$.  This means $y=ax^2-4ax+2a+1$. We see this is the form of $y=ax^2+bx+c$, so $b=-4a$ and $c=2a+1$. Therefore, if we subtract $2a+1$ from $-4a$, we will get $-4a-2a=-6a$.  We know that $b=-6a$ and $c=2a+1$. So, the zeroes of the quadratic must be $x=2+\\sqrt{3}$ and $x=2-\\sqrt{3}$.  The difference between these squares is $\\boxed{2\\sqrt{3}}$. This final answer becomes $m-n$, which means $m-n=\\boxed{2\\sqrt{3}}$. It is solved.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2\\sqrt{3}. I hope it is correct. We have $m = 2+\\sqrt{3}$ and $n = 2-\\sqrt{3}$, so $m - n = (2+\\sqrt{3}) - (2-\\sqrt{3}) = 2\\sqrt{3}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2\\sqrt{3}. I hope it is correct. The parabola has a vertex at $(2,1)$.  As such, the equation of the parabola is of the form $y=a(x-2)^2+1.$  Expanding the right side, we have $y=ax^2-4ax+4a+1.$  Since $b$ and $c$ are given by $b$ and $c$ respectively, it follows that $b=-4a$ and $c=4a+1.$ The difference between the roots of a quadratic $x^2+bx+c$ is simply $-\\frac{b}{a}$; therefore, the answer is $-\\frac{b}{a}=2\\sqrt{3}.$\nFinal Answer: The",
        " 1\nTo start, we know that this is a parabola that opens upward.  The $x$-intercept is $x=-4$, so $a(-4)^2 + b(-4) + c = 0$.  This simplifies to $16a - 4b + c = 0$.  The $y$-coordinate of the vertex is $1$, and since it is the maximum, we also know that the derivative must be zero there.  So, we have\n$$2ax + b = 0\\Rightarrow b = -2a(2) = -4a$$at $x=2$.  We also know that $a(2)^2 + b(2) + c = 1$, which simplifies to $4a - 4a + c = 1$, so $c = 1$.\nFrom here, we know that $16a - 4b + c = 0$ simplifies to $16a - 4(-4a) + 1 = 0$, so $16a + 16a + 1 = 0$, so $32a + 1 = 0$, and $a=\\frac{-1}{32}$.\nNow we can find $b$ in terms of $a$: $b = -4a = -\\frac{4}{32} = -\\frac{1}{8}$.  So, we have a quadratic with $a=\\frac{-1}{32}$, $b = -\\frac{1}{8}$, and $c = 1$.\nLet $\\displaystyle f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c = \\frac{-x^2}{32} - \\frac{x}{8} + 1$.  We know that $x = -4$ is a zero, so we have\n$$\\frac{(-4)^2}{32} - \\frac{(-4)}{8} + 1 = 0 \\Rightarrow \\frac{16}{32} + \\frac{4}{8} + 1 = 0 \\Rightarrow 1 + 1 + \\frac{1}{2} = 0$$which is false.  So, $-4$ is not a zero of $f(x)$.  From here, we can use the FOIL method to show that $\\boxed{m-n = 6}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 6",

        " \nThe parabola has its vertex at $\\boxed{(2,1)}$. This tells us that its $y$-intercept is $c=1$.

        " We want to find the zeros of $ax^2 + bx + c$ that are the $x$-intercepts.\nLooking at the graph, we can see that the parabola has a vertex at $(2,1)$, and its $x$-intercepts are located at $(-4,-3)$ and $(m,n)$.

        " Step 1: Write down the quadratic equation in vertex form. Because the vertex is at $(2,1)$, let\u2019s set $x=2$ and $y=1$ and plug it into the equation to get an equation in terms of $a$ and $c$: \\begin{align*}1&=a(2)^2+b(2)+c\\\\&=4a+2b+c\\end{align*}Rearranging this, we get $4a+2b+c-1=0$. To get the equation in vertex form, we first do a horizontal shift by $2$, which means we get $y=a(x-2)^2$. We have an equation with $a$ and $c$ unknown, so we need to find another step to set up an equation with $a$ and $b$ unknown. With the vertex at $(2,1)$, the parabola opens down, so the leading coefficient must be negative. Therefore, the equation has $a<0$. If the vertex is at $x=2$, the axis of symmetry is $x=2$, so $x=m$ and $x=n$ are equidistant from 2. That means $m+2=n+2$, so $m=n$. If the roots are both positive and equidistant, they must both be greater than 2. We know $m$ and $n$ are the roots, $a<0$, and the graph shows $y=f(x)$, so we can conclude $f(m) = f(n) = 0$. Putting the equation in vertex form doesn\u2019t help us find the roots, so we can factor: \\begin{align*}\nf(x)&=a(x-2)^2\\\\\n&=ax^2-4ax+4a\n\\end{align*}From the graph, we know $f(-4)=-3$, which we can plug into this equation to find: \\begin{align*}\n-3&=a(-4)^2-4a(-4)+4a\\\\\n&=16a+16a\\\\\n&=32a\n\\end{align*}So $a=-\\frac14$. Setting this into our equation: \\begin{align*}\n-3&=-(1/4)(x^2-4x+4)\\\\\n&=-1/4(x^2-4x+4)\\\\\n&",

The vertex is a fundamental point on the parabola\nthat is the turning point when looking at the graph of a quadratic function.\nUsing the given graph, we can find the coordinates of the vertex is $(2,1)$.\nStep3:\nIn this step, we can find the equation of parabola. To find the equation, we can use the formula:\u00a0$y-a=\\frac{1}{2}b(x-h)^2$\u00a0,\u00a0where (h, a) is the vertex of the parabola. Given the coordinates of the vertex, we have:\ny - 1 = $\\frac{1}{2}a(x - 2)^2$\nNow we can rearrange the formula to get the quadratic equation of parabola. Then we have:\ny = $\\frac{1}{2}a(x - 2)^2$\u00a0+ 1\nStep4:\nIn this step, we can find the zeros of the quadratic equation. We can see the x-intercepts are at (-4, -3) and (4, -3). Therefore, we have:\n$y = \\frac{1}{2}a(x - 2)^2$\u00a0+ 1 = 0\nBy setting the expression equal to zero and solving, we can find the zeros:\n$(x - 2)^2$\u00a0= 0\nx - 2 = 0 or x - 2 = 0\nThen we have:\nx = 2 or x = 4\nStep5:\nIn this step, we can find the answer. The difference of the x-intercepts is m - n = 2 - (-4) = 6.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 6. I hope it is correct.",
        " 2013 AIME I Problem 8\nFrom the vertex $(2,1)$, $c=\\frac{1}{9}$, $b=-4$, and $a=\\frac{1}{9}$. Therefore, the parabola is $y=\\frac{1}{9}x^2-4x+\\frac{1}{9}$. Thus, $m+n=2$ and $mn=1$. So, $m-n=2-1=\\boxed{1}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 1. I hope it is correct. 2013 AIME I Problem 8 Solution Explanation # The vertex is at $2$ in the $x$-axis and $1$ in the $y$-axis. Hence, $a$, $b$, and $c$ are found in the following way. $a$ is the value of the coordinate in the $y$-axis divided by the value of the coordinate in the $x$-axis squared. $b$ is the $x$-coordinate of the vertex multiplied by $-2a$ and $c$ is a value such that the coordinates of the vertex is a sum of the product of $a$ and the $x$-coordinate squared plus the product of $b$ and the $x$-coordinate plus $c$. Now, the quadratic equation becomes $y=\\frac{1}{9}x^2-4x+\\frac{1}{9}$. One of the factors of the standard quadratic formula is found by the $x$-coordinate. It can be found by the equation $x=\\frac{-b}{2a}$. Applying this equation, $x=\\frac{-(-4)}{2\\left(\\frac{1}{9}\\right)}=\\boxed{-8}$, so one of the factors of the quadratic is $x+8$. To find another factor, the Remainder Factor Theorem is used. The Remainder Factor Theorem states that when a certain value of $x$ is substituted into a quadratic equation, the remainder is $0$ and the result is an equation which is a linear combination of the $y$'s. Now, the value of $x$ that will give the root is plugged in: $y=\\frac{1}{9}x^2-4x+\\frac{1}{9}-y$. So, $\\frac{1}{9}(-8)^2-4(-8)+\\",
        " The $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $x = 2$. Therefore, the value of the function is $y = 1$ when $x = 2$:\n\\begin{align*}\n0 &= a(2)^2+b(2)+c-c\\\\\n&=4a+2b+c-c\\\\\n&=4a+2b.\n\\end{align*}To find the zeros of $ax^2+bx+c$, we set $f(x) = ax^2+bx+c$ equal to $0$ and solve for $x$: $f(x) = a(x^2-(b/a)+((b/2a)^2-(c/a))$ $= a(x-(b/2a))^2+(b^2-4ac)/4a$ $= a(x-(b/2a))^2+c_{\\leq 0}$. Since we know that the vertex $x=2$ means the function opens downward, we know that $a<0$. That means $b^2-4ac$ is positive, so the zeros are $m=\\frac{b-\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{-2a}$ and $n=\\frac{b+\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{-2a}$.\nSince $m>n$, we can simplify to solve for $m-n$: $m-n=\\frac{b-\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{-2a}-\\frac{b+\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{-2a}$ $=\\frac{-\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{-2a}$ $=\\boxed{\\sqrt{\\frac{b^2-4ac}{4a^2}}}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\sqrt{\\frac{b^2-4ac}{4a^2}}.

I hope it is correct. #### Additional Note: We can find the roots by plugging in the vertex coordinates: $1 = \\frac{1}{9}(2-2)^2+\\frac{8}{9} \\Longrightarrow c= -\\frac{1}{2},$ $-3 = \\frac{1}{9}(x-2)^2 -\\frac{1}{2} \\Longrightarrow x_1 = -4$. So the roots are $-4$ and $2$, meaning $m-n = \\boxed{-4-2=-6}$. #### Final Angle Addendum: To get the answer, we need to first examine the given graph of the parabola. We see that the vertex is at $(2,1)$, so we know that the equation in vertex form will be $y-1 = a(x-2)^2$. We know that the x-value of the parabola is $",
        " The vertex of the parabola is at $(2,1).$ Therefore, we know that\n$$2=\\frac{-b}{2a}$$\nor equivalently,\n$$b=-2a.$$We also know that $1=c$ since $c$ is the $y$-value of the parabola at $x=2.$\nFinally, we know that the zeros of the parabola are the $x$-intercepts of the parabola, which can be found using the quadratic formula. By letting $y=0$ and solving for $x$, we have\n$$0=ax^2+bx+c=ax^2-2ax+1\\Rightarrow x=\\frac{2\\pm\\sqrt{4-4a}}{2a}=2\\pm\\sqrt{1-a}.$$We can now conclude that the $x$-intercepts occur when $1-a=0\\Leftrightarrow a=1.$ Plugging this in for $a$ in the quadratic formula, we have\n$$x=2\\pm\\sqrt{0}=\\{2\\},$$so the zeroes of the quadratic are at $x=2$ and $x=2$. So, we know the final answer is $\\boxed{0}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 0.
