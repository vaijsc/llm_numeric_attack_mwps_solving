        "To solve for the positive integers \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( 2009 \\) such that they form a geometric sequence with integer ratio, we can denote the common ratio of the geometric sequence as \\( r \\). Thus, we can express \\( b \\) in terms of \\( a \\) and \\( r \\) as follows:\n\\[\nb = ar\n\\]\nIn a geometric sequence, the third term is given by:\n\\[\n2009 = br = ar^2\n\\]\nNow we can rewrite these equations as:\n1. \\( b = ar \\)\n2. \\( 2009 = ar^2 \\)\nFrom the second equation, we can isolate \\( a \\):\n\\[\na = \\frac{2009}{r^2}\n\\]\nNext, substituting \\( a \\) into the first equation, we have:\n\\[\nb = ar = \\frac{2009}{r^2} \\cdot r = \\frac{2009}{r}\n\\]\nThe conditions \\( a < b < 2009 \\) imply that:\n1. \\( \\frac{2009}{r^2} < \\frac{2009}{r} \\)\n2. \\( \\frac{2009}{r} < 2009 \\)\nAnalyzing **the first inequality**:\n\\[\n\\frac{2009}{r^2} < \\frac{2009}{r} \\implies 2009 < 2009r \\implies 1 < r\n\\]\nNow considering **the second inequality**:\n\\[\n\\frac{2009}{r} < 2009 \\implies 1 < r\n\\]\nThus, we conclude that \\( r > 1 \\).\nNow, since \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) must also be positive integers, \\( r \\) must be chosen such that both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) remain integers. Since \\( a = \\frac{2009}{r^2} \\), \\( r^2 \\) must divide \\( 2009 \\). \nNext, we can find the divisors of \\( 2009 \\). First, we find the prime factorization of \\( 2009 \\):\n\\[\n2009 = 7 \\times 287 = 7 \\times 7 \\times 41 = 7^2 \\times 41\n\\]\nThe divisors of \\( 2009 \\) are calculated as \\( (2 + 1)(1 + 1) = 3 \\times 2 = 6 \\). The divisors of \\( 2009 \\) are:\n\\[\n1, 7, 49, 41, 287, 2009\n\\]\nTherefore, the possible values for \\( r^2 \\) could be \\( 1, 7, 49, 41, \\text{and} 287 \\). This means \\( r \\) can be \\( 1, \\sqrt{7}, 7, \\sqrt{41}, \\sqrt{287} \\).

Given \\( r > 1 \\), we are left with \\( r = 7 \\).\nThus, we calculate \\( a \\):\n\\[\na = \\frac{2009}{7^2} = \\frac{2009}{49}\n\\]\nCalculating this division gives:\n\\[\n2009 \\div 49 = 41\n\\]\nSo, \\( a = 41 \\). To find \\( b \\):\n\\[\nb = ar = 41 \\cdot 7 = 287\n\\]\nFinally we verify:\n1. \\( a = 41 < b = 287 < 2009 \\) holds true.\n2. The sequence \\( 41, 287, 2009 \\) forms a valid geometric progression with common ratio:\n\\[\n\\frac{287}{41} = 7 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{2009}{287} = 7\n\\]\nThus, we have confirmed that all conditions are satisfied.

        " First, lets consider what a geometric sequence is. It is a sequence where each term divided by the previous term gives a constant ratio.  Therefore, if we denote $b$ to be the middle term (or the second term in a sequence), $a = b\\cdot r$ where $r$ is the ratio of each successive pair of terms.  Moreover, since $a$ and $b$ are integers we know that $b$ is a factor of both $a$ and $2009$, the final term.\n### Next, we can see that 2009 is odd. If 2009 were even, then there is no integer $b$ which divides 2009.  This is because the only possible factors for 2009 would be $2009 = 1\\times 2009 = 3\\times 669 = \\cdots$, and we see that every factor is even.\n### Since 2009 is odd, we know that $b$ is odd. Using this fact, we can express $b = 2t+1$, where $t$ is an integer. Since we have already determined $b$ to be odd, we can further express $t$ in terms of $b$, which yields $t = \\frac{b-1}{2}$.\n### Next, we can express $a = b\\cdot r$.

Because $2009$ is odd, it means $2009$ cannot be of factor of $2$. This makes true only if neither $a$ nor $b$ has a $2$ as a common factor. \nNow, $2009, b, a$ are of a geometric sequence and $a$ and $b$ are not both divisible by $2$  or $2009$, as $2009$ is odd and cannot divide both of them.

I hope it is correct.   NAL01\n    \nFrom the given information, we know that $a$, $b$, and $2009$ are consecutive elements of a geometric sequence. In other words, $b/a=r$, where $r$ is an integer greater than $1$. This implies that $a=\\frac{2009}{r}$ for some integer $r$. We are given that $a<b<2009$, so we know that $\\frac{2009}{r}<b$, which implies that $b>\\frac{2009}{r}$. We are also given that $a<b$, so $\\frac{2009}{r}<b\\le a$, which implies that $\\frac{2009}{r}\\le a$. Since both $a$ and $\\frac{2009}{r}$ are integers, this implies that $\\frac{2009}{r}=a$ because $r$ is an integer. Therefore, we must have that $\\frac{2009}{a}=r$. Since we know that $a$, $b$, and $2009$ are positive, we know that $\\frac{2009}{a}=r$ is greater than zero. This means that $r=\\frac{2009}{a}$ is a positive integer strictly larger than $1$. We are given that $r$ is an integer, so it is a factor of $2009$. We also know that $a<2009$, so $a$ cannot be a common factor of $2009$ and $50$. Since $r$ is a positive integer greater than $1$, $\\frac{2009}{a}$ is a positive integer greater than $1$. The positive divisors of $2009$ are: $1$, $7$, $11",
        " Since $2009$ is the last term, the sequence is $a,ar,ar^2,\\dots,ar^n=2009$ where $n=\\log_{\\frac{2009}{a}}a=\\log_{b/a}b$ (assuming that $b$ divides $2009$, because otherwise there is no solution) and hence the ratio is $r=\\sqrt[b]{\\frac{2009}a}$. So $ar=a\\cdot\\sqrt[b]{\\frac{2009}a}= \\sqrt[b]{2009b}$ (using the same variable $a$ \u2013 just don\u2019t confound $a$ and $\\frac{2009}a$ in the notation). Since this is an integer, it implies $a\\mid (a\\cdot\\sqrt[b]{\\frac{2009}a})$, which implies $a^2\\mid 2009$. Hence, $a$ can take the values $1$, $2$, $7$, and $1+2+7=10$, because there are no divisors of $2009$ below these, because $2009$ is not divisible by $11$, because it\u2019s a prime number. In the case when $a=1$, $b=\\sqrt[2]{2009}=44$, and so in the answer we take $a=\\boxed{2}$.",
        " For a geometric progression with a common ratio $r,$ $a$ and $b$ satisfy $$b=ar.$$We also know $$2009 = ar^2,$$since this is the next term in the sequence.  Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we find that $$2009-ar=b-ar^2\\Rightarrow r^2-ar+1=0.$$ The quadratic formula gives $$r=\\frac{1\\pm\\sqrt{(-1)^2-4(1)(-2009+1)}}{2(1)}=1\\pm\\sqrt{2009-1}.$$The quantity inside the radical is an odd integer. The only such positive square root is $\\sqrt{2008}$.  Thus, $r=1\\pm\\sqrt{2008}=1\\pm4\\sqrt{101}.$We know that $a<b$ and that these numbers are positive. Since $\\sqrt{101}>\\frac{1}{2},$ we have $r>1$, and hence $b=ar=2009\\cdot\\frac{r}{r}>2009\\cdot1=2009,$ which is a contradiction.  Thus, our answer is that $$r=1-\\sqrt{2008}=1-4\\sqrt{101}.$$From the first equation, $$b=a(1-4\\sqrt{101}).$$Substituting this in $2009=ar^2$, we can solve for $a$:\\begin{align*}\n2009&=a(1-4\\sqrt{101})^2\\\\\n&=a(1-8\\sqrt{101}+16(101))\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\quad a&=\\frac{2009}{1-8\\sqrt{101}+16(101)}\\\\\n&=\\frac{2009}{1+16(101)-8\\sqrt{101}}\\\\\n&=\\frac{2009}{1025-8\\sqrt{101}}\n\\end{align*}Notice that applying the rational root theorem would greatly simplify this problem, but I did not catch that the numerator and denominator were so small at first.\nP.S.

And if a is less than 7, then a will not be a divisor of 2009. Only a=7 satisfies both conditions. Satisfying all the criteria, we have a=7.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 7. I hope it is correct. ### ",
        " First, note that if $a$ and $b$ are both factors of the common ratio $k$.\n### Solution:  If $r$ is the common ratio, then $r = \\frac{b}{a}$, and we know $a = br$. This allows us to express $b$ in terms of $a$: $b = \\frac{a}{r}$; since $a<b$, $\\frac{a}{r} < a$, so we know that $r < 1$ since $r$ must be a positive integer less than 1.\n### ",
        " a=1\nGiven that $a$ and $b$ form a geometric sequence with ratio $r$ and $2009$ is also in the sequence, we can write $b=ar$ and $2009 = ar^2$. \nDivide the 2 equations by each other. We get $\\frac{b}{ar}=r$ and $\\frac{2009}{ar}=r^2$.\nNow take the square root of both sides of the second equation, $\\frac{\\sqrt{2009}}{\\sqrt{ar}}=r$, since you can always take the square root of a real number.\nCombine this with the first equation to get $\\frac{b}{ar}=r=\\frac{\\sqrt{2009}}{\\sqrt{ar}}$.\nCross multiply and simplify to get $br=\\sqrt{2009}r$, and then simplify to get $b=\\frac{\\sqrt{2009}}{r}$.\nPlug this back into the first equation to get $\\frac{\\sqrt{2009}}{ar}=r$.\nCross multiply again to get $r^2a=\\sqrt{2009}$, and simplify to get $a=\\frac{\\sqrt{2009}}{r^2}$.\nSince $a$ must be a positive integer, $a=1$ is the only solution.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 1.

        " Note that for any two consecutive terms $a$ and $b$ in a geometric sequence, we have\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{b}{a}&=r,\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad b&=ar,\n\\end{align*}where $r$ is the ratio, which is an integer here. Let\u2019s now write $2009$ in terms of $a$:\n$$2009=ar,$$where $r$ is an integer, so $a=\\frac{2009}{r}$. Since $a$ and $b$ are consecutive terms, we have $b=ar+1=2009r+1$. Thus, we can write the following system:\n$$\\begin{cases} a=\\frac{2009}{r},\\\\\nb=2009r+1,\\\\\na<b<2009.\n\\end{cases}$$The third inequality can be rewritten as\n$$\\frac{2009}{r}<2009r+1,$$which simplifies to\n$$r^2-r-2008<0.$$Note that $r$ is an integer, and thus it must fall into one of the following cases:\n\u2022 Case 1. $r<-1$ or $r>8$, in which case the above inequality is true.\n\u2022 Case 2. $0<r<8$, in which case the above inequality will be false, and the third inequality won\u2019t be satisfied.\nLooking at the second case, we have that $0<r<8$ and $r^2-r-2008<0$, which is equivalent to finding real solutions for $r$ in the following quadratic equation:\n$$r^2-r-2008=0.$$Note that $a$ is positive integer, which implies that $r$ must be positive integer as well. Thus, we can factor this equation using positive integers:\n\\begin{align*}\n(r-8)(r+251)&=0,\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad r&=8\\quad\\text{or}\\quad-251,\n\\end{align*}where we only consider the positive integer $r=8$, and discard $r=-251$ because we are looking for a positive integer solution. Consequently, $a=\\frac{2009}{8}=\\boxed{251}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 251. I hope it is correct.      With this approach, we have removed cases that we are not"
