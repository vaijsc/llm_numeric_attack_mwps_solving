This will give us the value inside the bracket which we will simplify and then particulate whether it is a whole number or not.\n$$-\\frac{7}{4}$$ We can simplify this now by rewriting the $\\frac{7}{4}$. When simplifying fractions we multiply both numbers by 4 to make 1 into the numerator then simplifiying. We multiply both numbers by 4 and that is:\n$$-\\frac{7\\times4}{4\\times4}=\\frac{-28}{16}$$ Simplifying the fraction we have:   $$-\\frac{28}{16}$$ Note that $28$ is divisible by $4$ and $16$ but we have least to multiply by by $16$ as it is divisible by $16$. and now we have \\frac{14}{8} which is not decimal and \\frac{-28}{16} equals  -7/4\\ thus -\\frac{7}{4}\n### Step 2: Decide whether $x$ is a whole number or not.\nWe want to know whether $-\\frac{7}{4}$ is a whole number or not. We know that a whole number is any integer that is greater than or equal to zero and less than zero. Therefore, we have  -\\frac{7}{4}\n### Step 3: Take \\boxed{} around the $x$.\nLooking at the value -\\frac{7}{4}\\text{we}know that it is a whole number based on this definition. If it were integer then the number appeirs in the bottom.  (ii) \\\\ latex: <latex>itet</latex>\nTaking $\\boxed{\\quad}$ around the $-\\frac{7}{4}$ which we have found it to be a whole number then $\\boxed{\\left\\lceil -\\frac{7}{4} \\right\\rceil}$ then becomes equally.

        " Express $\\left\\lceil -\\frac{7}{4}\\right\\rceil$ in terms of $\\lfloor\\cdot\\rfloor$ and $\\{\\cdot\\}$.

        " $\\boxed{-1}$\nWe can simplify without a calculator, knowing that $\\left\\lceil x \\right\\rceil$ gives the smallest integer larger than or equal to the real number $x$.\nThe first step is to calculate the value of $-\\frac{7}{4}$, which is $\\frac{-14}{4} = \\frac{-7}{2} = -3.5$. Since we are rounding to the nearest integer\u2014there is always rounding to the nearest integer in these types of questions\u2014the value of $-3.5$ is rounded to the nearest integer. The integer that $-3.5$ is closest to is $-4$. We could simply say that $-3.5$ is between $-4$ and $-3$, so the value of the ceiling function with $-3.5$ is $-3$. But we could also round $-3.5$ to $-3$. If we round $-3.5$ to $-3$, that is the same as the number $-3$ rounded to the nearest integer. The correct answer choice in the case that we want to know the number that we would round up to the nearest integer is $-1.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -1. I hope it is correct.  **However**, some solvers wouldn't like the last sentence.  We could also reason that -3.5 is between -3 and -4, so this value should round to \u20131 since it\u2019s closer to -1, which is the integer that the ceiling function will give. But it seems to me that this way of thinking is not so constructive\u2026  **Edit**:  **-3** is only halfway to -2 and -4.  -3.5 would round to -3 in this case.  The word problem here is worded very poorly.  But we could look at it this way: -3.5 is more than halfway from 0 and \u2013 4, so it should round to \u2013 4.  That is, \u2013 3.5 < 0, so \u2013 4 is more negative than \u2013 3, so \u2013 3.5 should round to \u2013 4, which is the ceiling, or greatest integer not less than \u2013 3.5.  It's the integer closest to \u2013 3.5 that is greater than \u2013 3.5; it's not the integer closest to \u2013 3.",

We can write -\\frac{7}{4} < y \\le -1.5.\nWe can write -1.75 < y \\le -1.5. This does not looks important because y is between -1.5.\nYou could write y \\le -2. But you could not write y < -2.\nHowever, when you try to find \\left\\lceil -\\frac{7}{4}\\right\\rceil, we are looking for the least integer greater than -\\frac{7}{4}. In the given answer choice, we do not know why, but -2 not in the choice. Ah, it seems like 1 is missing. We are looking for the least integer greater than -\\frac{7}{4}, so we want to find out y \\ge -2. Now we can write y. To find solutions, you can say either y=-2 or y=-1.5 or y=-1.7. Now, you see that y=-2 and y=-1.5 or y=-1.7. So, we have our final answer. Our answer is \\boxed{-2}.\nRemember our equation. \\left\\lceil -\\frac{7}{4}\\right\\rceil = -2.

It is the largest integer that is less than or equal to $x$. Let $\\lceil x \\rceil$ be the ceiling function of a given real number $x$. It is the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to $x$.

In order to solve for x, we need to know the value of $x+\\frac{3}{4}$ because $$\\lceil x \\rceil = x+\\frac{3}{4}$$Note that $$x = -1.75$$but, in order to decide which integer $\\lceil x \\rceil$ equals we see that $$\\lceil-2\\rfloor$$is closer to 1.75 than$$\\lfloor -3 \\rfloor$$.

I may have misunderstood your graphically well presented answer. Since this is about ceiling, we will evaluate the positive of that by flipping and when flipping, you will get 1/4. Adding 7/4 and then turn back to flipping taking the ceiling. Since adding is done, then doing (1/4) and giving the biggest integer which is 2 whole and 0 remainders. That makes it 2.
