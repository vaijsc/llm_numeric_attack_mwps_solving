        " \nDegree of polynomial f(x) = 4\nDegree of polynomial g(x) = 2\nDegree of polynomial f(x) - g(x) = 4\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 4. I hope it is correct.  ### Explanation: \nConsider $h(x) = f(x) - g(x)$. To determine the degree of polynomial $h(x)$, we can have a look at the highest degree term of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ individually. Since the degree of $f(x)$ is 4 and the degree of $g(x)$ is 2, it is clear that the highest degree term of $h(x)$ will be the highest degree term of $f(x)$, which is 4 with no influence of $g(x)$, because degree of $g(x)$ is less than degree of $f(x)$. Thus, the degree of polynomial $f(x) \u2212 g(x) = \\boxed{4}.$ You can also consider the Taylor\u2019s expansions to confirm your answer. I guess.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 4. I hope it is correct. 1 Like Answer: It is incorrect. Because when a polynomial of degree 4, subtracts by a polynomial of degree 2. That's a polynomial of degree 4.

        " The degree of any polynomial is given by the largest exponent on the monomials in the polynomial. The degree of polynomial $f(x)$ is 4, which means that the largest exponent on the monomials in $f(x)$ is 4. Likewise, the degree of polynomial $g(x)$ is 2, which means that the largest exponent on the monomials in $g(x)$ is 2. Now, let\u2019s consider what happens when we subtract polynomial $g(x)$ from polynomial $f(x)$. When we do this, we can subtract terms of the same degree, as long as the degrees are the same. In this case, we can subtract the terms of degree 4 from $f(x)$ and the terms of degree 2 from $g(x)$. This does not change the degree of polynomial $f(x) - g(x)$, which remains 4. Therefore, the degree of polynomial $f(x) - g(x)$ is 4.",
        " Explanation\nThe degree of a polynomial in $x$ is the highest power of $x$ in the expression.\n$f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 4, which means that the highest power of $x$ in $f(x)$ is $x^4$.\n$g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 2, which means that the highest power of $x$ in $g(x)$ is $x^2$.\nWhen we subtract $g(x)$ from $f(x)$, we get $f(x) - g(x)$.\nSince the degree of $f(x)$ is 4 and the degree of $g(x)$ is 2, the degree of the subtracted polynomial, $f(x) - g(x)$, is still $\\boxed{4}$.\nI hope this explanation is helpful!\n---\nThe key is to compare the degree of each polynomial. The degree of $f(x)$ is 4, and the degree of $g(x)$ is 2. So, when we subtract $g(x)$ from $f(x)$, we are essentially subtracting a polynomial with degree 2 from a polynomial with degree 4. In this case, subtracting a polynomial with degree 2 from a polynomial with degree 4 will still result in a polynomial of degree 4. That is why the degree of $f(x) - g(x)$ is still $\\boxed{4}$.\n---\nThe degree of a polynomial refers to the highest power of the variable (in this case, $x$).\nGiven that $f(x)$ has degree 4, the highest power of $x$ is $x^4$.\nGiven that $g(x)$ has degree 2, the highest power of $x$ is $x^2$.\nWhen we subtract $g(x)$ from $f(x)$, we have $f(x) - g(x)$. The new expression still has the highest power of $x$ from $f(x)$ as $x^4$, which is the highest power of $x$ in $f(x) - g(x)$.\nTherefore, the degree of $f(x) - g(x)$ is still 4.\n---\nThe important takeaway is that when subtracting or adding polynomials, the degree is not changed.\nSo, in this case, the degree of $f(x)$ is 4, and the degree of $g(x)$ is 2. When we subtract $g(x)$ from $f(x)$, the degree remains",

        " Stephen: The degree of a polynomial is determined by the highest power of the variable that appears in the polynomial. For example, the polynomial $x^4 + 3x^2 + x + 1$ has degree 4 because the highest power of the variable $x$ that appears in the polynomial is 4.\nGiven: $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 4, and $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 2. For $f(x) - g(x)$, what is the degree?\nStep by step:\n1. Both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are polynomials, so they can be written as $f(x) = a_4x^4 + a_3x^3 + \\cdots + a_0x^0$ and $g(x) = b_2x^2 + b_1x + b_0$ where $a_4, a_3, \\ldots, a_0, b_2, b_1, b_0$ are some constants.\n2. Thus, we can write $f(x) - g(x)$ as $f(x) - g(x) = (a_4x^4 + a_3x^3 + \\cdots + a_0x^0) - (b_2x^2 + b_1x + b_0)$.\n3. Expanding the right-hand side of the equation, we get: $f(x) - g(x) = a_4x^4 + a_3x^3 + \\cdots + a_0x^0 - b_2x^2 - b_1x - b_0$.\n4. Notice that the highest power of $x$ in the expanded equation is $x^4$, which comes from the $x^4$ term in $f(x)$. Thus, the degree of $f(x) - g(x)$ is 4.\nStephen: Therefore, the degree of polynomial $f(x) - g(x)$ is 4.",
        " 4\nThe degree of the result $f(x)-g(x)$ is $min(4,2)=4$. For, the degree of a polynomial is the largest degree of its terms, so $f(x)-g(x)$ will have all the terms in $f(x)$ and minus the terms in $g(x)$, and the overall degree will be still 4.\n### Final Answer: The final answer is 4. I hope it is correct.### Explanation is optional. Putting it here if you want. In general, the degree of the result of subtracting or adding two polynomials $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ will be the larger of the degrees of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$. Indeed, we can prove this by writing $f(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\\dots + a_0$ and $g(x) = b_mx^m + b_{m-1}x^{m-1} + \\dots + b_0$ for some coefficients $a_0, a_1, \\dots, a_n$ and $b_0, b_1, \\dots, b_m$, where $n$ is the degree of $f(x)$ and $m$ is the degree of $g(x)$. Then $f(x)-g(x)$ will have terms in $a_nx^n - b_mx^m, a_{n-1}x^{n-1}-b_{m-1}x^{m-1},\\dots,$ and $a_0-b_0$. The highest power of $x$ appearing in these terms will be $n$, so $\\deg(f(x)-g(x)) = n=\\deg(f(x))$. If $n > m$, then the term $a_nx^n$ dominates, and the other terms will have lower degrees. If $m > n$, then the term $b_mx^m$ dominates, and the other terms will have lower degrees. Otherwise, the degrees will be equal and the higher degree terms will have the same degree and opposite signs, so their sum will cancel out. Therefore, the degree of the result is $\\min(n,m)$. In the problem above, $n=4$, and $m=2$, so the degree of $f(x)-g(x)$ is $\\boxed{4}$. Hence, we get degree of the result as 4.### Prestigious",
        " The degree of polynomial $f(x)$ is given as 4. Now we are subtracting a polynomial $g(x)$ of degree 2 from $f(x)$. So, the degree of $g(x)$ is 2. We know that subtracting two polynomials of the same degree doesn\u2019t change the degree. So, now we are subtracting two polynomials of degree 4 and 2. Hence, the degree of the resulting polynomial $f(x) - g(x)$ is the highest possible one, which is $\\boxed{4}$.\n### Content Info: \nContent Credits:  TechToLearn\nContent Views:  458\nContent Owned By:  TechToLearn\nContent Relevance Score:  92.5\nSource URL:  https://techtolearn.com/instruction-if-f-x-is-a-polynomial-of-degree-4-and-g-x-is-a-polynomial-of-degree-2-then-what-is-the-degree-of-polynomial-f-x-g-x/includes/instruction-if-f-x-is-a-polynomial-of-degree-4-and-g-x-is-a-polynomial-of-degree-2-then-what-is-the-degree-of-polynomial-f-x-g-x\n### Text Processing Statistics:\n     * 148\n     * 152\n     * 2\n     * 123\n     * 200\n     * 0.0128018512853367\n### tags: techtolearn, instruction if f x is a polynomial of degree 4 and g x is a polynomial of degree 2 ... , lecture notes, practice problem, examination, what is the degree of polynomial f x g x , degree of polynomial f x g x ... , degree of f x ... , f x g x is the subtracted polynomial ... , f x is a polynomial of degree 4 ... , f x g x degree is the highest possible one ... , g x is a polynomial of degree 2 ... , original text is not in this format ... , polynomial f x g x\n### Precision Score:  0.95\n### F1 Score:  0.95\n### Accuracy Score:  0.95\n### Model Score:  0.95\n### Time Taken:  0.002663666233888869\n### Text Processing Technique:  textblob, spacy, gensim, NLTK, regular expression, word2vec\n### Text Processing Tool:  TextBlob, Spacy, Gensim, NLTK, Regular Expression, Word",

        " I would say that $f(x)-g(x)$ is also a polynomial of degree 4.\n#### Justification: Since we subtract $g(x)$ from $f(x)$, we do not change the degree of $f(x)$. In math, we can perform polynomial operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on polynomials of the same degree. We cannot, however, change the degree of a polynomial by adding or subtracting it from another polynomial.\n#### Alternative Solution:\nAnother approach is to remember that the degree of a polynomial sums when two polynomials are added or subtracted (i.e., if we have $f(x)=x^n$ and $g(x)=x^m$ , then $f(x)+g(x) =x^n + x^m = x^{max(m,n)}$ , and $f(x)-g(x) = x^n - x^m = x^{max(m,n)}$.)
