Note that $i^2 = -1$, so $f(i) = i^2 = -1$.\nWhen $z$ is real, $f(z)$ is equal to $z$ itself plus 2. Thus, $f(1) = 1 + 2 = 3$ and $f(-1) = -1 + 2 = 1$.  On the other hand, when $z$ is not real, $f(z)$ is equal to $z$ squared.

Final Answer: The final answer is 4. I hope it is correct. Further information: We can also test $f$ at other complex numbers, like $i + j$ or $-i + j$, as an exercise. Because we know that $i + j = 1$, $-i + j = i$, $i + j = i + 2j$, and $-i + j = -i + 2j$ will cross the origin $z = 0$, so if we apply $f$ to these values, we will get the same result. Hence, we observe that $f$ transforms the complex plane in such a way that it gives a sort of \"reflection\" of the number in the upper half plane. Final Answer: The final answer is 4.

        " $$f(i) = (i)^2 = -1$$ since we are working with complex numbers, $$f(1) = 1+2 = 3$$ since 1 is a real number, $$f(-1) = (-1) + 2 = 1$$ since -1 is a real number, $$f(-i) = (-i)^2 = 1$$ since -i is a complex number. Thus, we have that $$f(i)+f(1)+f(-1)+f(-i) = (-1) + 3 + 1 + 1 = \\boxed{4}$$\nThe complex number, say, $z$, is part of a geometric series that is the domain of its powers. Since $i$ is imaginary, $i$ is imaginary so $i^{2}$ is real, but we cannot have $i^{2}=i$, because of the zero present in the imaginary axis in the coordinate system,\nOnce we take $i$ to another $i \\times 2 = -1$, thus obtaining a real part.\nWhen we try the same with real and imaginary number, that will now switch the real and imaginary part. for real to -1 will get real part $-2$,\nThe -i complex number is the same as the +i one.\nSo we can sort all together $i,1,-1,-i$ like real or imaginary.\nThe issue with $f(z) = z^2$ is that there are not just as the imaginary complex numbers.\nIt means f(z) = z^2 for y+i for integer y\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 4.

        " First, when we evaluate $f(1)$, we use the second clause of the definition, since 1 is real.  Therefore $f(1)=1+2=3$. Similarly, $f(-1)=-1+2=1.$ Next, evaluate $f(i).$  Since $i$ is not real, we use the first clause of the definition.  This gives $f(i)=i^{2}=-1.$\nFinally, we don\u2019t need to think about whether $-i$ is real or not.  It is not, since its imaginary part is $-1$ and its real part is 0.\nTherefore $f(-i)=(-i)^{2}=-i^{2}=-(-1)=1.$ In total, we have $f(i)+f(1)+f(-1)+f(-i)=-1+3+1+1=\\boxed{4}.$\n#### Detail explanation---by z308\nIn the following we break down an  \\textbf{4 minute video} into several short paragraphs:\n   In the first two minutes, I talk about the first clause in the function. So, when we evaluate $f(i)$, we use the first clause of the definition, since $i$ is not real. When we evaluate $f(i)$ with the first clause, $f(i)=i^2$. We know $i^2=-1$, so $\\boxed{f(i)=-1}$.\n       In the next minute, we talk about the second clause of the function. For simplicity, let's call $x=1$.  When we evaluate $f(1)$, we use the second clause of the definition. In the original definition of the function, we have $f(x)=x^2$ if $x$ is not real OR use the second clause in the original definition, which is $f(x)=x+2$ if $x$ is real. If $x$ is real, then we must use the second clause. In this case, we know $x=1$ is a real number, so use the second clause. In this expression, we have $f(1) = 1 + 2$. We do the addition, and $1+2=3$. So $f(1) = \\boxed{3}$.\nIn the last minute, I will do rest of $f(z)$ for $z=-i$. Since $-i$ is",
