        " Solution of the given system of equations.\nIn order to solve this system of equations, we need to turn the system into two equations with two variables: y = 2x^2 + kx + 6 \\\\ y = -x + 4\nLet\u2019s set up the system of equations:\n\\begin{align*}\ny &= 2x^2 + kx + 6 \\\\\ny &= -x + 4\n\\end{align*}\nWe can see the system of equations shares the same variable, y. Therefore, we can set the first equation equal to the second equation, which is:\n\\begin{align*}\n2x^2 + kx + 6 &= -x + 4 \\\\\n2x^2 + kx + 6 + x &= 4 \\\\\n2x^2 + (k+1)x + 6 &= 4\n\\end{align*}\nNow, we can solve the equation:\n\\begin{align*}\n2x^2 + (k+1)x + 2 &= 0\n\\end{align*}\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\\begin{align*}\nx &= \\frac{-(k+1) \\pm \\sqrt{(k+1)^2 - 8(2)}}{4} \\\\\nx &= \\frac{-(k+1) \\pm \\sqrt{k^2 + 2k + 1 - 16}}{4} \\\\\nx &= \\frac{-(k+1) \\pm \\sqrt{k^2 + 2k - 15}}{4}\n\\end{align*}",
        " \nTo start, we can solve the system of equations (although we can do this at the end in an alternate solution method): $$\\begin{align*} y &= 2x^2 + kx + 6\\\\ y &= -x + 4\\end{align*}$$ From the equations, we have $y = 2x^2 + kx + 6$ and $y = -x + 4$, and we can multiply the second equation by -1 to get $-y = x - 4$. So, \\begin{align*}\n2x^2 + kx + 6 &= -x + 4\\\\\n2x^2 + (k+1)x + 2 &= 0\n\\end{align*} Now, using the quadratic formula, $$x = \\frac{-(k+1) \\pm \\sqrt{(k+1)^2 - 8(2)}}{4}$$ Since there is only exactly one solution we are looking for, this must have exactly one real root. For there to be exactly one real root, $$0 = (k+1)^2 - 8(2) = (k+1)^2 - 16 = (k+1)^2 - 4^2$$ Since the last equation factors as $$(k+1-4)(k+1+4)=0$$ This gives $$k+1 = -4,\\, k+1=4 \\Rightarrow k=-5,\\, k=3$$ So $k=-5$ is the only negative value that works for us.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -5. I hope it is correct.  As we have found out from the 1st approach, the only value of $k$ that makes the two curves intersect at only one point is $-5$. Hence, the value of $k$ that satisfies the required criteria is $\\boxed{-5}$.

        " The key is to first substitute the expressions for y from the equations.\nWe have y = 2x^2 + kx + 6 and y = -x + 4. By using the substitution 2x^2 + kx + 6 = -x + 4, we get 2x^2 + kx - x + 4 - 6 = 0, which simplifies to 2x^2 + (k-1)x - 2 = 0.\n### Move to Quadratic Formula\nNow we have the general form of the quadratic equation, and we can solve for x using the quadratic formula.\nLet x = \\frac{-b\\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}.\nSo we have x = \\frac{1-k\\pm\\sqrt{(k-1)^2 + 8}}{4}.\n### Find Condition for One Solution\nNow, we want to find the condition for exactly one solution. So, we want the discriminant equal to 0.\nSo, where the discriminant equals zero: (k-1)^2 + 8 = 0. Let's solve for k.\nLet (k-1)^2 + 8 = 0 \\Rightarrow (k-1)^2 = 8 \\Rightarrow k-1 = \\pm2 \\Rightarrow k = 3 or k = -1 (since we are looking for the negative value)\nSo, the correct answer is -1. The negative value of k for which there is exactly one solution is k = -1.\n### Brief Answer\nIn the given system of equations, the condition for there to be exactly one solution is when the discriminant of the quadratic equation 2x^2 + (k-1)x - 2 = 0 equals 0. It can be seen that the discriminant equals 0 when k = 3, but the question asks for the negative value of k. Therefore, the correct answer is k = -1. Final Answer: The final answer is -1. I hope it is correct.  The correct answer is the one where you take the minus sign in the final answer. If you get +1 you would be adding a branch not multiplying to the function as per quadratic formula So in quadratic formula the +/- sign are used to indicate the possible values the root can take. Another way to think about it is essentially you are saying that there can only be 1 particular solution in quadratic equation . It",
        "  We'll go step by step through the problem and find the value of $k$ that makes the system have exactly one solution.\n### Solution:\n(i) Equating the two expressions for $y$ in the system, we get\n$$2x^2 + kx + 6 = -x + 4.$$If we isolate the $x^2$ terms:\n\\begin{align*} 2x^2 - x + 2 &= 0 \\\\ x^2 - \\frac{1}{2}x + 1 &= 0 \\\\ \\left(x - \\frac{1}{4}\\right)^2 + \\frac{15}{16} &= 0. \\\\ \\end{align*}\nThis is a quadratic equation in $x$.\n(ii) The discriminant of the quadratic equation is $(-1/2)^2 - 4\\cdot 2 \\cdot 15/16 = (-2)/16 = -1/8$.

        " The first step is to simplify each equation by noticing that they are equal.

If we can find the $k$ for which there is exactly one solution, we have found the answer.  Let\u2019s find the values of $k$ that make this statement true.  If we equate coefficients, we have that $-2=-1$, so the only solution to $2x+5=0$ is for $x=-\\frac{5}{2}$.  To have exactly one solution, this must also solve $x-k-2=0$, which implies $-\\frac{5}{2}-k-2=0$, so $-k=\\frac{1}{2}$, and therefore $\\boxed{k=-1}$. This is the value for $k$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -1. I hope it is correct.  Time spent: 3 minutes.  We could have solved this problem by setting the two sides on the right-hand sides of the equation equal to each other and solving for $k$ but honestly, solving for $x$ this way was quicker for me.

We can solve this by just setting them equal to each other: 2x^2 + kx + 6 = -x + 4. Now we can expand 2x^2 and combine the terms: 2x^2 - x + kx + 6 = 4. Now let\u2019s move all the terms to one side: 2x^2 + (k-1)x - 2 = 0.\nNow, let\u2019s think about what happens when are the coefficients of x are both the same.

        "  We will solve the system of equations. \\begin{align*} 2x^2 + kx + 6 &= -x + 4 \\\\ 2x^2 + (k+1)x -2 &= 0 \\end{align*} The last equation is a quadratic equation. We will use the quadratic formula to find its solutions. \\begin{align*} x &= \\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\\\\ x &= \\frac{-(k+1)\\pm\\sqrt{(k+1)^2+8}}{4}\\\\ x &= \\frac{-(k+1)\\pm\\sqrt{k^2+2k+9}}{4} \\end{align*} Since there is only one solution, the roots (solutions) of the quadratic equation must be equal. Therefore, the discriminant $k^2+2k+9=(k+3)^2$ must be zero. Thus, $k+3=0\\Rightarrow k=\\boxed{-3}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -3. I hope it is correct. Here\u2019s why this gives exactly one solution. If the discriminant $k^2+2k+9$ is negative, there are no real solutions, while if it is positive, there are two distinct solutions. But for a single solution, the discriminant must be zero. Thus the square of $k+3$ must be zero, so $k+3=0\\Rightarrow k=\\boxed{-3}$. So, we find that only $k=-3$ gives a single solution. That is why this is the only value that works. You can see the graph of the function $y=2x^2-kx+6$, with $k=-1$, $k=0$, and $k=2$, respectively. Depending on the value of $k$, the function may have $0,2, 1,$ or $c$ solutions. We can see that only when $k=-3$, there is exactly one solution. The graph with $k=-3$ is added below. It shows one solution. You can explore other graph with other values of $k$. It will be helpful in studying the concept of systems of equations. This way, we can graphically check that the discriminant must be zero when there is only one solution. For different values of $k$, there may be different numbers of solutions. Graph",
        "Plugin Problem\nThere are more than one ways, yet mine is consistent and applicable to a variety of system equations involved. \n### Solution\nWe get two equations for solving.

Hence we put in (1):\n2x^2 + kx + 6 = -x + 4\nWe subtract the right side to left side:\n2x^2 + (k-1)x + 2 = 0\nWe can now solve for x. We will let\u2019s think of the X we are looking for to have no values. This takes place as the coefficient in front of the x multiplied by the constant term becomes equal to 0.\n2x^2 + (k-1)x + 2 = 0\nWe find the discriminant here (something rather useful for solving quadratic equations):\n(k-1)^2 - 4*2*2 = 0\n(k-1)^2 - 16 = 0\nSimplify equation:\n(k-1)^2 = 16\nNow think for it neatly:\nWe have to make sure the equation we solve for the X we prove:\n(k-1)^2 = 16\nk-1 = 4 or k-1 = -4\nk = 5 or k = -3\nSo we have the solutions 5 and -3. Now, when we find x, there should be only one solution.\nTake the discriminant from before:\n(k-1)^2 - 4*2*2 = 0\nk = 5 or k = -3\nFor k = 5, the discriminant is > 0, meaning (1) has two solutions. \nFor k = -3, the discriminant is 0, meaning (1) has only one solution.\nThus the answer is k = -3.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -3.

        " \nFrom the first equation, we can express $y$ as $y = 2x^2 + kx + 6$. Then, we can substitute $y$ with $-x+4$ from the second equation, so we have $-x+4 = 2x^2 + kx + 6$, which can be simplified to $2x^2 + (k-1)x -8 = 0$. \n### First, we need to determine whether there is exactly one solution to this equation.\n#### Factoring\nLet\u2019s try to factor the equation $2x^2 + (k-1)x -8 = 0$. We have $2x^2 + (k-1)x -8 = 0$, so $(2x + 4)(x - 2) = 0$, which implies $x = -2$ or $x = 2$ as the solutions.\n#### Specific $k$ value\nIn this case, since $x = -2$ or $x = 2$, we can find the value of $k$ by substituting $x$ with $-2$ or $2$.\n    - Substituting $x = -2$, we have $2(-2)^2 + (k-1)(-2) - 8 = 0$, which simplifies to $8 - 2k - 8 = 0$, which gives $k = 0$.\n    - Substituting $x = 2$, we have $2(2)^2 + (k-1)(2) - 8 = 0$, which simplifies to $8 + 2k - 8 = 0$, which gives $k = 0$.\n#### Answer\nFrom this, we find that there is exactly one solution to the system of equations when the value of $k$ is $\\boxed{-0}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -0.

        " 1. A unique solution for a system of equations.\nFor a system of equations to have exactly one solution, it must be linearly independent. This can be checked by subtracting one equation from the other (for the same variable). Here, we subtract $y = -x + 4$ from $y = 2x^2 + kx + 6$ to get \\begin{align*}\n(2x^2 + kx + 6) - (-x + 4) &= 0 \\\\\n2x^2 + (k+1)x + 2 &= 0 \\\\\n\\end{align*} As long as the coefficient of the $x^2$ and $x$ terms are not both zero, the system will be linearly independent, and there will be exactly one solution. We can use the quadratic formula to find $x$.\n### 2. A meaningful root for real $x$.\nThe quadratic formula isn\u2019t very useful if the discriminant is negative. For the discriminant of $2x^2 + (k+1)x + 2 = 0$ to be positive, we need\n$$b^2 - 4ac > 0,$$ where $a = 2, b = k+1, c = 2$. This simplifies to $$(k+1)^2 > 8$$ or $$(k - (-1))^2 > 8,$$$$|k+1| > 2\\sqrt{2}.$$ So we need $k < -1 - 2\\sqrt{2}$ or $k > -1 + 2\\sqrt{2}$. So we are trying to find a negative value of $k$, which fits the case $k < -1 - 2\\sqrt{2}.$\n### 3. Solving for $k$.\nWe plug in $k = -1 - 2\\sqrt{2}$ into the quadratic formula $$x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \\frac{-(k+1) \\pm \\sqrt{(k+1)^2 - 4(2)(2)}}{2(2)} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{(k-(-1))^2 - 16}}{4}.$$ It seems we have nowhere to go on this.

        " \nThe following processes will help us solve the given system of equations.\nFirst, since we have two equations with two variables, our intention is to find the value of $k$ which results in only one solution.\nSecond, we can rewrite the first equation, $y = 2x^2 + kx + 6$, as $0 = 2x^2 + kx - 6$. We want to get rid of the constant term by shifting the equation. So, to avoid this problem, we write the equation in the standard form form:\n$$2x^2+kx-6=0$$ The general formula for quadratic equations is $ax^2+bx+c=0$ where $a,b,c$ are real numbers. Therefore, when we compare $2x^2+kx-6$ with the formula, we can consider $a$ as $2$, $b$ as $k$ and $c$ as $-6$.\nNow, we can rewrite the second equation, $y = -x + 4$, as $0 = x - 4$ to find a common denominator.\nThe denominator will be $2$ for the first equation. So, we multiply the second equation by $2$ to make both denominators the same as follows:\n$$2x-8=0$$ As we can see, the coefficients of both equations are now the same, which is a great thing for us because it simplifies the process.\nThe same arguments can be told about $-8$ as $-6$ when we compare $2x^2+kx-6$ with $x$.\nThird, now it is time to find the value of $k$ which results in only one solution.\nFourth, the roots can be found using the discriminant $b^2 - 4ac \\ge 0$ that the equation is now in the form of $ax^2+bx+c=0$ Therefore, \\begin{align*}\n(2x-k)(x-4)=0,\n\\end{align*} We can now obtain a set of the solutions by solving the following equations: \\begin{align*}\n&2x-k=0 \\hspace{10mm} \\mbox{or} \\hspace{5mm} x-4=0,\\\\\n&\\Rightarrow\\quad x=\\frac{k}{2} \\hspace{5mm} \\mbox{or} \\hspace{5mm}",
        " \nThe system of equations can be written in the form\n$$2x^2 + kx + 6 = -x + 4$$which is equivalent to\n$$2x^2 + (k + 1)x - 2 = 0.$$Now we use the quadratic formula:\n\\begin{align*}\nx &= \\frac{-(k+1)\\pm\\sqrt{(k+1)^2+8}}{4}\\\\\n&=\\frac{-(k+1)\\pm\\sqrt{k^2+2k+9}}{4}.\n\\end{align*}The quadratic equation has exactly one solution if and only if the discriminant\n$$(k^2+2k+9) = 0,$$which occurs when $k^2+2k+9 = 0$.

        " This is a very difficult problem, and I will first show you how to solve it step by step.\nLet's solve it step by step.\n### Step 1: Create an equation involving only one unknown\nLet's start from the given equations:\n\\begin{align*}\ny &= 2x^2 + kx + 6 \\\\\ny &= -x + 4.\n\\end{align*}\nThe second equation is already nice and clean. Let's use it to substitute for $y$ in the first equation:\n$$2x^2 + kx + 6 = -x + 4.$$Now we have an equation involving one unknown variable, which is $x$.\n### Step 2: Clear the fraction (if necessary)\nLuckily, the equation is already free of fractions, so we don't need to do this step.\n### Step 3: Group variables and constants\nNow we start grouping variables and constants:\n$$2x^2 + (k-1)x - 2 = 0.$$\nWe have grouped the variables ($x$) and the constants (-2) on the left side and the coefficients of $x$ on the right side. This step is important because it makes it easier to recognize the type of equation.\n### Step 4: Identify the type of equation\nNow we recognize that it's a quadratic equation in the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, where $a = 2$, $b = k-1$, and $c = -2$. We know that the solutions to this equation can be found using the quadratic formula.\n$$x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}.$$But we don't need to find the solutions yet. We'll come back to it later.\n### Step 5: Find the discriminant (if possible)\nBefore we proceed, let's analyze the discriminant ($b^2-4ac$) because it tells us whether the equation has one, two, or no solution.\n$$b^2-4ac = (k-1)^2 - 4(2)(-2) = k^2-2k+1+8 = k^2-2k+9.$$\nNow we need to find $k$ such that the equation has exactly one solution.\n### Step 6: Set the discriminant equal to zero\nTo find the value of $k$ that gives us exactly one solution,"
