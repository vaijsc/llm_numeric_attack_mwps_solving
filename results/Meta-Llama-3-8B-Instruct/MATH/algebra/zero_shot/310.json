        " 3 + 5 + 1 = 9\nThis solution is correct. The midpoint formula says that the coordinates of the midpoint are the averages of the coordinates of the endpoints. So the x-coordinates of the midpoint will be the average of 3 and 5, which is $\\frac{3+5}{2} = 4$. And the y-coordinates will be the average of 1 and 1, which is $\\frac{1+1}{2} = 1$. So the midpoint is at $(4,1)$, and the sum of its coordinates is 4 + 1 = 5, not 9. This response is incorrect. For each coordinate, the average of the two values is simply the sum of the two coordinates divided by 2. So the sum of the x-coordinates is 3 + 5 = 8, and the sum of the y-coordinates is 1 + 1 = 2. Thus, the sum of the coordinates is 8 + 2 = 10. This response is incorrect. The formula for finding the midpoint of a line segment is \\begin{align*} (x_1+x_2)/2 &= (3+5)/2 = 4 \\\\ (y_1+y_2)/2 &= (1+1)/2 = 1 \\end{align*}Therefore, the midpoint is $(4,1)$, and the sum of the coordinates is $4+1=\\boxed{5}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 5.

I hope it is correct.",
        " \nThe midpoint of a line segment with endpoints A and B is the average of the coordinates of each point.\nLet $A$ be the point $(3,1)$ and $B$ be the point $(5,1)$. Then the midpoint of $AB$ is going to be exactly the point that is the average of its two endpoints.\nIts $x$-coordinate is $\\frac{3 + 5}{2} = \\frac{8}{2} = 4$, and its $y$-coordinate is $\\frac{1+1}{2} = \\frac{2}{2} = 1$. So, its coordinates are $(4,1)$.\nTherefore, the sum of the coordinates of the midpoint is $\\boxed{5}$.  I hope it is correct.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 5. I hope it is correct.",
        " The midpoint of a line segment with endpoints $A(x_1,y_1)$ and $B(x_2,y_2)$ is $\\left(\\dfrac{x_1+x_2}{2},\\dfrac{y_1+y_2}{2}\\right)$.\nIn this case, $A(3,1)$ and $B(5,1)$. Therefore, the midpoint is\n\\begin{align*}\n\\left(\\dfrac{3+5}{2},\\dfrac{1+1}{2}\\right)&=\\left(\\dfrac{8}{2},\\dfrac{2}{2}\\right)\\\\\n&=\\boxed{(4,1)}\n\\end{align*}The sum of the coordinates is $(4)+(1)=5$, which is your answer.

        " (type your response here)\nThe midpoint formula is (x1+x2)/2 and (y1+y2)/2, where (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) are the endpoints. We are given the endpoints (3,1) and (5,1) so we have\n$$\\frac{3+5}{2}=\\frac{8}{2}=4$$and\n$$\\frac{1+1}{2}=\\frac{2}{2}=1.$$\nSo the sum of the coordinates of the midpoint is 4+1 = 5.\n### Answer:\n5",
