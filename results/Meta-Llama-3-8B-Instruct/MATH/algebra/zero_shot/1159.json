        "To find the center of the circle defined by the equation \\( x^2 + 6x + y^2 + 8y = 0 \\), we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle.\n1. **Group the \\(x\\) terms and the \\(y\\) terms:**\n   \\[\n   (x^2 + 6x) + (y^2 + 8y) = 0\n   \\]\n2. **Complete the square for the \\(x\\) terms:**\n   - Take the coefficient of \\(x\\) which is \\(6\\), halve it to get \\(3\\), and then square it to get \\(9\\).\n   - Thus, \\(x^2 + 6x\\) becomes:\n     \\[\n     (x + 3)^2 - 9\n     \\]\n3. **Complete the square for the \\(y\\) terms:**\n   - Take the coefficient of \\(y\\) which is \\(8\\), halve it to get \\(4\\), and then square it to get \\(16\\).\n   - Thus, \\(y^2 + 8y\\) becomes:\n     \\[\n     (y + 4)^2 - 16\n     \\]\n4. **Substituting back into the equation:**\n   Replace \\(x^2 + 6x\\) and \\(y^2 + 8y\\) in the original equation:\n   \\[\n   ((x + 3)^2 - 9) + ((y + 4)^2 - 16) = 0\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this gives:\n   \\[\n   (x + 3)^2 + (y + 4)^2 - 25 = 0\n   \\]\n   This can be rearranged to:\n   \\[\n   (x + 3)^2 + (y + 4)^2 = 25\n   \\]\n5. **Identifying the center of the circle:**\n   The standard form of the circle is \\((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\\), where \\((h, k)\\) is the center and \\(r\\) is the radius.

        " The quadratic form can be written as $$(x+3)^2+ (y+4)^2 = 9+16 =25.$$Therefore, the center of the circle is at $(-3,-4)$. The sum of the coordinates of the center of the circle is $\\boxed{-3-4=-7}$.",
        " \nRecall that the equation of the circle centered at $(h,k)$ can be written as $(x-h)^2+(y-k)^2 = r^2$.  Notice that $$(x-h)^2+(y-k)^2 - x^2 - y^2 = r^2 - x^2 - y^2.$$Now, our given equation is $x^2 +6x +y^2 +8y =0$, so subtracting $x^2 + y^2$ from both sides and moving some terms to the other side gives $$x^2 +6x +y^2 +8y -x^2 - y^2 = 0 - (x^2 + y^2).$$Then we have $$(x +6) + (y +8) = x^2 + y^2 =0.$$Moving the $x^2 + y^2$ to the other side yields $$x+6+y+8 = - (x^2 + y^2).$$Since $x^2 + y^2 =0$, this simplifies to $$x+y+14=0.$$Now, we know that the sum of the coordinates of the center of the circle is $h+k$, so let\u2019s just reduce this equation to match the desired sum: $$x+y = -(14)$$, and thus the sum of the coordinates of the center of the circle is $\\boxed{-14}$.\n#### Solution video\nWhat\u2019s the next step?

        " \nWe need to rewrite the equation in the standard form $$(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$$of a circle centered at $(h, k)$.If we add $h^2 +2hk +k^2$ to both sides of the equation, and then complete the squares, we find that (x+3)^2 + (y+4)^2 = 25.To simplify this expression, we recognize that the squared binomial $(x+3)^2$ can be written as $(x+3+0)^2 = (x+3)^2 + 0^2$, which means the coefficient on the $(x+3)^2$ term in the sum is the same as the coefficient on $x$ in the original equation, i.e., $1$.  Similarly, $(y+4)^2 = (y+4+0)^2$, which gives $1$ as the coefficient on the $(y+4)^2$ term.Using the technique of completing the square, we can write$$(x+3+0)^2+(y+4+0)^2 = 25$$ to obtain$(x+3)^2+(y+4)^2 = 25 .$\nThat\u2019s it!Our equation is now in standard form.

        " \nTo solve this problem, we need to complete the square for both variables.\nWe start with the equation $x^2 +6x +y^2 +8y =0$.  Adding $(3)^2$ and $(4)^2$ to both sides does not change the equation because those are square numbers and we are subtracting them from the original equation.  This gives us $x^2 +6x +9 +y^2 +8y +16 =9+16$.  Now, we can simplify this equation by combining like terms.\nThe new equation looks like this: $(x+3)^2+(y+4)^2=25$.  This is the equation of a circle with its center at $(-3,-4)$ and a radius of 5.\n### Answer: \nThe sum of the coordinates of the center of the circle is $(-3)+(-4)=\\boxed{-7}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -7. I hope it is correct. ###\n## Solution example:\nExplain the concept, what does it mean by the center of a circle in a simpler way.\nIn simpler terms, the center of the circle is the point where the circle touches itself. If you draw a line from the center to the edge of the circle, and then continue it, you will get the circumference of the circle. The center of the circle is also the point where all of the points of the circle are equally away from. For example, if you have a basketball, the center of the circle, where the hoop is, is the middle point of the hoop. All points of the hoop are equally away from this center point.\nIf we consider this example, then the point $(-3,-4)$ is the center of the circle because all points of the circle are equally away from this point. This means that all points on the circle are an equal distance from the center point. We cou\n### ",
        "  We can complete the squared trinomial using the perfect square decomposition $(x+b)^2=(x+b)(x+b)=x^2+2bx+b^2$. Thus, $x^2+6x=(x+3)^2-9$.  Now we have the equation in the form $(x+3)^2+y^2+8y =9$ or $(x+3)^2+(y+4)^2=25$.  This is the equation of a circle with center $(-3,-4)$.  The sum of the coordinates of the center is $\\boxed{-7}$. Final Answer: The final answer is -7. I hope it is correct.  Let me know if you have any doubt.  I will try to help.  Thank you for the efort.  You can verify this answer by putting the center of the circle $(-3,-4)$ into the equation.  To do this, we must have $(x+3)^2+(y+4)^2=9$ implies $(-3+3)^2+(-4+4)^2=9$ thus $0^2+0^2=9$, which is NOT TRUE.  Therefore, the equation must be WRONG and our answer is WRONG.  Let me think again.  Well, we have $x^2+6x+y^2+8y=0$ or $y^2+8y+x^2+6x=0$.  Completing the square, $y^2+8y+16+16+(x^2+6x+9) =16+9$, or $(y+4)^2+(x+3)^2=25$.  Now we know that $a^2+b^2=c^2$ is the equation of a circle with center in the first quadrant.  The center of this circle is $(-3,-4)$ and the radius is $r=5$. I may be wrong because I misunderstood the problem, or there is another mistake,  and you are invited to tell me how I am wrong. If the radius of the circle is $r$, then we can check if the point is on the circle, the distance from the point to the center of the circle is $r$.  The distance is given by the formula $d = \\sqrt{(x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1-y_2)^2}$ where $(x_1,y",
