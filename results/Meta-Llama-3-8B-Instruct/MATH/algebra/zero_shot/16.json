An exact verification implies that the answer that we had was still correct. Check: Next, to verify teh function is continuous, it has to be that the limit is continuous at -3.",
        " $f(-10) = 3(-10)+5 = -30+5 = \\boxed{-25}$",
        " Since x=-10, we have x \\[f(-10)=3(-10)+5=3(-10)+5=-30+5=-25.\\]So, our answer is \\boxed{-25}.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -25. I hope it is correct.",
        " We have that \\begin{align*}\nf(-10)&=3(-10)+5\\\\\n&=-30+5\\\\\n&=\\boxed{-25}.\n\\end{align*}",
        " \nFirst, we know that $-10 < -3$.\n### Step 1:\nSo, we need to apply the first part of the piecewise function, which is\n$3x + 5$.\n### Substitute $x$ = -10\nWe substitute $x = -10$ into the function, so we get\n$3(-10)+5 = -30 + 5 = \\boxed{-25}$.\n### That's it:\nTherefore, $f(-10) = -25$. ",
        " $f(-10) = 3(-10)+5 = -30+5 = -25.$\n### What does the solution represent?\nThe solution represents the value of the piece-wise defined function $f(x)$ at the specific input value $x = -10$.",
        " To evaluate $f(-10)$, we determine which domain interval for which $f$ is defined lies in $(-\\infty,-3)$.\nNote that $-10<-3$, so $-10$ lies in the interval $(-\\infty,-3)$.\nTherefore, it must be that\n$$f(-10)=3(-10)+5=\\boxed{-25}.$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -25. I hope it is correct.\u03b2"
