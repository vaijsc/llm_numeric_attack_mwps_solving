        " Final Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{40}$.\n### Explanation: The first step is to calculate the coordinates of midpoints $E$ and $F$.  We can then find the equation of the line $EF$ and substitute $(0,7)$ to find the x-value $a$.  We want to find the equationof $AB$ so we can calculate its length.  Now we have the lines $AB$ and $DC$ in slope-intercept form.  We find the equation of $EF$ and $CD$, then we substitute the coordinates of $A$ and $E$ into $EF$ to find $y$-intercept.  We use Pythagorean theorem to find the equation of the diagonal from $D$ to $A$.  We can find its equation of line, then find its length.  We find its slope, the hatchhetonian reciprocal.  Finally, the area is the result of half the diagonal product given.\n### Solution Video:This video requires 2.50 MB of hard drive space. The Solution video for the above problem is provided below.

        " Since $ABCD$ is a kite with respect to $AC$ and $BD$ as diagonals, $ABCD$ has a symmetrical structure between $B$ and $C$.

As ABC is common in two triangles (\u0394 ABC and \u0394 CBD but not in \u0394 BDC)...note : we split two areas. We are left with 2-BDC. Then the area of the kite is still ABCD.

They are INTERSECTING each other at the center their bisectors would do c (2) These diagonals form two pairs of congruent triangles they cut into smaller ones.

I hope it is correct.  [This problem was copied from AoPS.] ### Name: amc8 ### Key concept: Diagonals The key concept here is that the area of a kite is half the product of its diagonals. The area of the kite, [kc], is given by \\begin{align*} \\frac{1}{2} |a | | b | [/math] where a and b are the lengths of the diagonals. This formula can be found by drawing a quadrilateral with diagonals and splitting it up into two triangles. Each triangle will have half the area of the quadrilateral. But since they are congruent, they will each have the same base and height, so their areas will be equal. The product of two equal quantities is equal to their square, so the area of the quadrilateral is half the product of the diagonals. To find the area of the kite, we have to find the diagonals. The diagonals are shown above. The top diagonal jumps from 7 to a point on the x-axis, so its length is 7. The bottom diagonal jumps",
        " I need the diagonals.\nWe know, that it\u2019s a kite, so we have two pairs of adjacent equal sides: $AB$ and $CD$ having the same length (none proven, just randomly like in this problem), and $BC$ and $AD$ also having the same length. One diagonal is obviously $AC$ and the other one is $BD$.\nTo make this notation more synthetic (keyword: onion-like cutting), the considered quadrilateral can be treated as a trapezoid-like shape subtracted by a triangular region (read it as: on the back-side of $AC$, and continue to the middle, and, at the end, enclose the region considered). In so doing, $AB$ will be part of $\\overline{AC}$, $\\overline{CD}$ will be part of $\\overline{BD}$, $\\overline{BC}$ will be part of both $AB$ and $CD$, and $\\overline{AD}$ will be part of both $BC$ and $CD$. And, one side is part of both diagonals because diagonals are all internal to the area. Hence, the areas of trapezoid and triangular regions are what we have got so far in addition to the Kite region.\nNow we have two sides. In other words, what we actually are looking at is the results of two consecutive events at each other.",

        "  To find the area of the kite, we first need to find the coordinates of the diagonal points in terms of $x$ and $y$. Let\u2019s denote points A, B, C, D by the points $(0,7), (1,0), (12,-2), (7,8)$ respectively. First, let\u2019s find the midpoint of the diagonal $\\overline{AC}$: $$\\left(\\frac{0+12}{2}, \\frac{7-2}{2}\\right) = (6,2.5).$$ Call this point $M$. Similarly, the midpoint of the diagonal $\\overline{BD}$ is: $$\\left(\\frac{1+7}{2}, \\frac{0+8}{2}\\right) = (4,4)$$ Call this point $N$. The area of the kite is half the product of the diagonals. To find the diagonals, let\u2019s find the lengths of $AC$ and $BD$. The point $(0,7)$ lies on $AC$, so $AC$ has y-intercept $y = 7$ and has slope $\\frac{-2-7}{12-0}=-\\frac{9}{12}=-\\frac{3}{4}$. Using the point-slope form of a line, we have: $$y - 7 = -\\frac{3}{4}(x-0)\\Leftrightarrow y = -\\frac{3}{4}x+7$$ Rearranging, we have $AC$ as the equation: $$x+4y=28.$$ Using the midpoint $M$, we can find $x$ and $y$: $$x+4y = 28 \\Leftrightarrow 6+4(2.5)=28$$ $$\\Leftrightarrow4(2.5) = 14\\Leftrightarrow2.5 = 14/4 \\Leftrightarrow5/4=14/20=7/12$$ So, $AC$ has length $7/12$ Now, let\u2019s use the point $(7,8)$ as the point on $BD$ and find the equation of $BD$ as follows: $$y-0=-1(x-7)\\Leftrightarrow y=-x+7$$Combining this with the midpoint $N$, we have: $$4=-7+7\\Leftrightarrow-7=0\\Leftrightarrow7=-13/",

Therefore, since these are both in the same place $(x,7)$, the point $C$ is (in the same place). Therefore, the area is the (blending the two areas)(-x+8)(7) +xsdg/sy value of \\$ DG=",
        " \nThe length of the altitude from $C$ to $AB$ can be solved using the pythagorean theorem. Note that $[ACD]=\\frac{1}{2}DB\\cdot AC$ (The altitude from $C$ divides triangle $ACD$ into two triangles with $1/2$ as the ratio). The length of this altitude is\n\\begin{align*}7^2-(-2)^2=\\sqrt{49+4}=\\sqrt{53}\\end{align*}\n(as can be seen from drawing a square-centered triangle onto the coordinate plane and noting that the square\u2019s length is equal to the hypotenuse of this right triangle). So the area of triangle $ACD$ is $\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{53} \\cdot 12=12\\sqrt{53}$\nOn the other hand, consider triangle $ABC$. The altitude from $B$ has (x, y) coordinates $(-\\frac{49}{41}, \\frac{41}{41})$ (can be found using similar logic) and the length of $BC$ is $\\sqrt{12^2+2^2}=2\\sqrt{77}$. The area of triangle $ABC$ is $\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{77} \\cdot 2 \\sqrt{77}=\\sqrt{77}^2=\\boxed{77}$\nNote that when drawn a square-centered triangle onto the coordinate plane, we can solve for the length of the base and height by doing Pythagorean theorem. That will tell us the length of the altitude from $B$ and the length of $BC$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 77.

        " First, we need to solve for the diagonals of this kite\u2019s coordinates. The diagonals are from $A$ to $D$ and $B$ to $C$. Both of them have the same length by definition.\n### Step 1: Diagonals\nThe line segment from $A$ to $D$ in $kite$ $ABCD$ can be expressed as follows:\\begin{align*}\n\\overrightarrow{AD} &= \\overrightarrow{OA}+\\overrightarrow{OD}\\\\\n&= (0,7) + (7-0,8-7)\\\\\n&= (0,7) + (7,1)\\\\\n&= (7,8)\n\\end{align*}The same thing can be applied to the line segments $B$ to $C$: \\begin{align*}\n\\overrightarrow{BC} &= \\overrightarrow{OB}+\\overrightarrow{OC}\\\\\n&= (1,0) + (12-1,-2-0)\\\\\n&= (1,0) + (11,-2)\\\\\n&= (12,-2)\n\\end{align*}Now that we have the diagonals, we are more than halfway to find the area of the kite!\n### Step 2: Area\nNow, we use our formula to calculate the area:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Area of kite} &= \\frac{1}{2} \\ |\\overrightarrow{AD}\\times\\overrightarrow{BC}|\\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2} |(7,8)\\cdot (11,-2)|\\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2} | 92|\\\\\n&= \\boxed{46}\n\\end{align*}\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 46.
