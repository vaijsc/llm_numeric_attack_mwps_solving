Since each red box weighs 15.2 ounces, the total weight of three red boxes together is 3 * 15.2 = 45.6 ounces. So, we set up the following equation: 2b = 45.6 Now, let\u2019s solve the equation for b. Divide both sides by 2 to get: b = 45.6 / 2  b = 22.8 So, one blue box weighs 22.8 ounces.\nTwo identical blue boxes together weigh the same as three identical red boxes together, and each red box weighs 15.2 ounces.\n(Blue box 1) + (Blue box 2) = 3 * (15.2) ounces\nLet Blue box = B; so,\nB + B = 45.6 ounces\nCombine like terms,\n2B = 45.6\nDivide both sides by 2,\nB = 22.8\nNow, you know that Blue box = 22.8 ounces.\n#### Attachment Added by Support\nExcuse me? Do we really need to go through all that to find the solution? No, we don't. If we consider that two blue boxes together weigh the same as three red boxes together, then one blue box will weigh the same as 1.5 red boxes. This means the blue box weighs:\n1.5 * 15.2 = 22.8 ounces.\nCalculate the answer to be the same as the solution showed: 22.8 ounces. That's it! No more fuss.",
        " We know each red box weighs 15.2 ounces. Then, three red boxes together weigh 3 x 15.2 = 45.6 ounces.\nLet\u2019s say 1 blue box weighs X ounces.\nThen, 2 blue boxes together weigh 2X ounces. It says that 2 blue boxes weigh the same as 3 red boxes. That means, 2X = 45.6 (because 3 red boxes weigh 45.6 ounces).\nSolving for X, we get X = 45.6 / 2 = 22.8 ounces.\nSo, 1 blue box weighs 22.8 ounces. It is easy to see that:\n22.8 * 2 = 45.6\nIs equal to the weight of the 3 red boxes together.\nTherefore, each blue box weighs 22.8 ounces. Answer: 22.8 ounces.\n### ",
        " Assume the weight of one blue box is x . Since two blue boxes weigh the same as three red boxes, we have\n$latex 2x = 3\\left(\\right. 15.2 \\left.\\right) ,$\n### Solving for x\n$latex 2x = 45.6$\n$latex x = \\frac{45.6}{2} = 22.8$\n### Therefore, one blue box weighs 22.8 ounces.\n(21 minutes)Session End-ownerGroup14241 Discussion "
