        "To find the domain of the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{2x - 7}{\\sqrt{x^2 - 5x + 6}} \\), we need to ensure that the function is defined; this involves checking two conditions related to the denominator.\n1. **Denominator cannot be zero**: The square root in the denominator, \\( \\sqrt{x^2 - 5x + 6} \\), must not be zero.

        "  In order to find the domain, we need to ensure that the denominator is not equal to zero. We can have that the denominator is not equal to zero by stating that $$x^2-5x+6>0.$$Since we are only concerned about the sign of the expression, we can use a discriminant. The discriminant is given by $b^2-4ac=-5^2-4\\cdot1\\cdot6=-25-24=-49<0$. Therefore, we cannot factor this expression into two binomials. However, we can use the quadratic formula to obtain $$x=\\frac{5\\pm\\sqrt{-49}}{2}=\\frac{5}{2}\\pm i\\cdot\\frac{\\sqrt{49}}{2}=\\frac{5}{2}\\pm3i.$$Since we are dealing with real values, we will focus on the real parts of these values. Hence, we are dealing with a single real solution of $x=\\frac{5}{2}$. We must have $x^2-5x+6>0$ when $x\\neq\\frac{5}{2}$ and $x^2-5x+6\\ge0$ when $x=\\frac{5}{2}$. We will only consider these statements that involve strict inequalities. If the strict inequality $x^2-5x+6>0$ holds, the inequality will certainly still hold when $x=\\frac{5}{2}$. Therefore, we must ensure that $x^2-5x+6>0$ when $x\\neq\\frac{5}{2}$. We will show that both possible cases work.\nCase I: $x<\\frac{5}{2}$ In this case, the expression $x^2-5x+6$ is a quadratic in a single variable. In order to find the quadratic function, we will rewrite it as $$x^2-5x+6=(x-\\frac{5}{2})^2+3.$$We will factor this expression as follows: $$(x-\\frac{5}{2})^2+3>0.$$Since the square of a real number is always non-negative, the expression $$(x-\\frac{5}{2})^2+3>0$$ is certainly true. This means that the case where $x<\\frac{5}{2}$ satisfies the condition $x^2-5x+6",

This means that the denominator of the expression is always non-negative, and thus the domain is all real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$. In other words, the domain of the real-valued function $f(x)$ is $\\boxed{\\mathbb{R}}$.\nThis is because we can evaluate the function at any real number $x$ without encountering any issues, including division by zero. The denominator will always be non-zero and the expression under the radical will be non-negative, ensuring that $f(x)$ is real-valued for all real numbers $x$.",
        " Step 1: Try to solve the denominators for which the expressions are real.\nIn general, the expression $\\sqrt{x^2+bx+c}$ is real when $x^2+bx+c \\ge 0$ and undefined when $x^2+bx+c < 0$. So to ensure the expression is real, we solve $x^2-5x+6 \\ge 0$ which becomes:\n$$x^2-5x+6 \\ge 0$$\n$$x^2-5x+6=0$$\n$$x^2-5x+2.5^2+2.5^2-6=0$$\n$$(x-2.5)^2 \\ge 0$$\n$$x-2.5 \\ge 0$$\n$$x \\ge 2.5$$\n$$x \\le 2.5$$\nThis inequality is true for all real values of $x$ therefore it also includes our domain. We have to include the {\\it non-strict} inequality and this means that we must include the case when $x=2.5$.\n**Note:** x cannot be less than 0, since the expression in the denominator is square root. In this case the square root is less than 0, which is definition of a square root.\nStep 2: Determine where the denominator is 0\nThe expression is undefined when the denominator is 0. To find out where the denominator is 0, we set $x^2-5x+6=0$:\n$$x^2-5x+6=0$$\n$$(x-2.5)^2-1.5^2=0$$\n$$(x-2.5)^2=1.5^2$$\n$$x-2.5=\\pm1.5$$\n$$x=2.5\\pm1.5$$\n$$x=1$$\n$$x=4$$\nWe have our special values in the domain: $x=1$ and $x=4$.\nStep 3: Combine all values from Step 1 and Step 2\nSo we get the domain when x is real number, and $x \\ge 2.5$ or $x=1$, $x=4$.

        " \nFirst, we need to consider if there are any problems with dividing by zero. From the denominator, we can see that we can\u2019t have $x^2-5x+6=0$. To solve this quadratic equation, we can begin with the factored form:\n$x^2-5x+6=0\\Rightarrow(x-2)(x-3)=0.$\nSetting each factor equal to zero, we obtain:\n$x-2=0\\Rightarrow x=2$\n$x-3=0\\Rightarrow x=3.$\nTherefore, the values that we can\u2019t have are $x=2$ and $x=3$.

The radicand $x^2-5x+6$ is a quadratic expression, and as we found above, it can be factored:\n$x^2-5x+6=(x-2)(x-3).$\nSince $(x-2)(x-3)$ can be zero, we can\u2019t take the square root of zero or a negative number. This means that $x^2-5x+6$ is always positive or zero, and the square root of it will always be real. Therefore, there are no other restrictions on $x$, and we\u2019ve found that the domain of the function is $x\\ne 2, x\\ne 3\\Rightarrow\\boxed{(2,3) \\cup (3,2) = (-\\infty,2) \\cup (2,3) \\cup (3,\\infty)}$.",

        " The domain of the expression is the set of all $x$-values that satisfy the equations in the expression. Note that here, we don't have any restrictions as $x$ approaches $\\infty$. Therefore, our task is to check the constraints for the denominator. The denominator has to be non-zero for any $x$-value. In order to do this, we need to solve for $x^2-5x+6=0.$ Then, we need to solve the following:\n\\begin{align*}\nx^2-5x+6 &=0\\\\\n(x-3)(x-2) &=0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x&=3\\text{ or }x=2.\n\\end{align*}Since the domain of the function is all the $x$-values that make the denominator non-zero, we cannot have $x=2$ or $x=3$. Thus, the domain is \\boxed{\\text{all }x\\text{-values except }x=2\\text{ and }x=3}. We can also graph $f(x)$ with these constraints in blue here:\nNote here that we don't have any more constraints for $x$ going to $\\pm\\infty$ since $x$ is real-valued.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is all $x$-values except $x=2$ and $x=3$.

This is a good spot to observe that there is no $x$ in the denominator, which indicates that we will have a domain stretching from $- \\infty$ to $+ \\infty$. That is, unless there are any possible roots in the denominator.\nStep 3: Observe the domain\nWe have $(x-2)(x-3.5)$ that is our denominator. For this to be 0, one of the two terms must be 0. That is, what $x$ will make $x-2=0$ and $x-3.5=0$?\nWe have $x=2$ and $x=3.5$. These are square roots. The radicand cannot be less than 0, so we have $x^2-5x+6 \\geq 0$. Since $x^2-5x+6=(x-3)(x-2)$, we get $(x-3)(x-2) \\geq 0$. We now use the sign charts. We observe that $x^2-5x+6$ is positive for $x > 3$ and $x < 2$.\nStep 4: Find the domain\nThere are no values for $x$ where $x-3$ and $x-2$ are simultaneously 0. Thus, the domain is all real numbers except $x = 2$ and $x = 3.5$.

        " The domain of the real-valued function $f(x)$ is $\\boxed{(2,3]}$. \nThe function $f(x)$ has a real-valued denominator if and only if the expression inside the radical, namely, $x^2-5x+6,$ is not negative. That is,\n$$x^2-5x+6\\geq 0.$$The discriminant of this equation is $(-5)^2-4(1)(6)=1$, which means that $x^2-5x+6$ can be factored as $(x-2)(x-3)\\geq 0$. From this, we can see that the expression inside the radical is nonnegative if and only if $x\\in(2,3]$. When $x=2$, the denominator $x^2-5x+6$ is equal to 0, so $f(2)$ is a limit that remains undefined.\nTherefore, the domain of the function $f(x)$ consists of the points in the interval $(2,3]$, which can be written as $(2,3]$. \nFinal Answer: The final answer is (2,3]. I hope it is correct.  If you have any further questions, please let me know.  Let\u2019s keep solving!  -T(>- If you have any further questions, please let me know."
