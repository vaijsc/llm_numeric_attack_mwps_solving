        " 96\n### Explanation:\nLet\u2019s use our first equation to solve for $ab$: \\begin{align*}\n2ab&=12\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad ab&=12/2=6\\\\\n\\end{align*}\nLet\u2019s use this to calculate $8a^2b^2$: \\begin{align*}\n8a^2b^2&=8(a^2)(6^2)\\\\\n&=8(a^2)(36)\\\\\n&=8(6^2)(6)\\\\\n&=\\boxed{96}\n\\end{align*}\nLet\u2019s go through the solution step by step.\n### Reference: 8ab\u00b2\nLet\u2019s think step by step.\n### ",
        " We know that $2ab=12$. This means $ab=6$. We also know that $8a^2b^2$, which is $2^3a^2b^2$. We can now express this as $4\\cdot2a^2\\cdot6^2$.\nNext we know that $2a^2=ab^2+a^2b$, and $ab=6$. Therefore, we have $2a^2=6+6a^2$, or $6a^2=2a^2$. $6a^2-2a^2 = 6a^2-6a^2=0$, or $8a^2=0$. Therefore, $a^2=0$, and $a=0$.\nFrom here we know that $a=0$, and $ab=6$, which means $b = \\frac{6}{0}$, which is impossible to solve.\nTherefore, $8a^2b^2 = 0$.\n### ",
        " For the expression $2ab$ the given equation is $2ab = 12$. The left side is a product of two variables: $2ab$, a product of numbers times a variable. Then, for the expression $2ab$, $b$ must be $\\frac{12}{2a}$. Thus, we have the final expression: $8a^2b^2$ is $8a^2(\\frac{12}{2a})^2$, $8a^2(\\frac{12^2}{4a^2})$, then $\\boxed{72a}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 72a. I hope it is correct."
