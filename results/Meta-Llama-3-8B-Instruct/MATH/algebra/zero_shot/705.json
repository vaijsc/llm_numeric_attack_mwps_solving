    "solution": "The number of feet the car travels in each second is an arithmetic sequence with first term 45 and common difference $-5$.  We are summing all the positive terms in this sequence (these terms represent the number of feet the car travels in each second). Thus, we want to find the sum $45+40+\\dots+5$.\n\nThe sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms.  The number of terms is $45/5 = 9$, so the sum is $(45 + 5)/2 \\cdot 9 = \\boxed{225}$.",

        " We need to find how many seconds it takes for the car to stop, then add up the feet it travels in each of these seconds.\nTo find how many seconds it takes for the car to stop, we can set up an equation that says: Total distance traveled = distance traveled in first second + distance traveled in second second \u2026\u2026\u2026.+ distance traveled last second\nThis is because the car travels 45 feet in the first second, then 45-5 = 40 feet the next second, then 40-5 = 35 feet the next second, and so on.\nWe know the total distance traveled will be 0 feet, or the car will stop.  The last distance traveled will be 0 feet too, so we can write an equation like this: \n0 = 45 + (45-5) + (45-10) + (45-15) +\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.+ (0-5) + 0\nThis can be simplified by combining the numbers outside of the parentheses.   0 = 45 + 40 + 35 + 30 + 25 + \u2026\u2026\u2026.+ 0\nKeep doing this until you get to 0 at the end.    0 = 45 + 40 + 35 + 30 + 25 + 20 + 15 + 10 + 5 + 0\nNow we have the correct total distance traveled.  We need to add the total distance traveled:\nTo add up the total distance, we can use a formula like this:\nTotal distance traveled = (45+40+35+30+25+20+15+10+5) feet\nTotal distance traveled = 225 feet\nTo get the total distance, we need to add up the distance it travels in each second.\nWe know it will stop traveling in 10 seconds. We want to add up the distance traveled in each of those seconds.\nSo we can write an equation like this: \nTotal distance traveled = 45 (first second) + 40 (second second) + 35 (third second) + 30 (4th second) + 25 (5th second) + 20 (6th second) + 15 (7th second) + 10 (8th second) + 5 (9th second) + 0 (last second)\nTotal distance traveled = 225 feet",

        " 1\n#### Problem Statement: \nWhen a car's brakes are applied, it travels 5 feet less in each second than the previous second until it comes to a complete stop.  A car goes 45 feet in the first second after the brakes are applied.",
        " \nThe question tells us that as time goes by, the car travels 5 feet less each second than it did in the previous second.  The first second is when the car travels 45 feet.\nHere is the table of the seconds we can make:\nSeconds | Distance (feet)\n---------|-------------\n1       | 45\n2       | 40\n3       | 35\n4       | 30\n5       | 25\n6       | 20\n7       | 15\n8       | 10\n9       | 5\n10      | 0\nWe know that the car will stop after 10 seconds, so we just need the total distance the car travelled in those 10 seconds.  To find this distance, we just add up the distances of each second:\n45 + 40 + 35 + 30 + 25 + 20 + 15 + 10 + 5 + 0 = 225\nThe car travelled 225 feet from the time the brakes were applied to the time the car stopped.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 225. I hope it is correct.\n### Key Concept:\nThe key concept here is understanding the pattern of how the car's distance changes over time.  As time goes by, the distance decreases by 5 feet each second.  The combination of this pattern and the initial condition ( travels 45 feet in the first second) allows us to calculate the total distance traveled by the car.\n### Difficulty Level: \nI would rate the difficulty level of this question as moderate.  It requires a good understanding of the pattern of the car's distance as well as the ability to add up the distances of each second to find the total distance traveled.  However, the pattern is a simple one to understand, and the algebra is straightforward, which makes it still accessible to students who are familiar with patterns and basic arithmetic.  Therefore, I would rate the difficulty level as 6 out of 10.  ### Tags: Patterns, Addition, Algebra, Distance, Speed, Brakes, Car, Physics. ### Explanation: The problem is describing a geometric progression. A geometric progression is a progression in which the difference between terms is a constant ratio. In this case, the ratio is 5/45, or 1/9, so the problem is describing a geometric progression decreasing by 1/9 each second. The first term is 45, and the progression goes on until the last term is 0. To find",

        " Here is the step-by-step solution.\n### Step 1: Calculate the number of seconds it takes for the car to stop.\nThe car travels 5 feet less each second than the previous second. So, after the first second, it travels 45 - 5 = 40 feet. Then, after the second second, it travels 40 - 5 = 35 feet, then 35 - 5 = 30 feet, and so on. We keep subtracting 5 feet from 30 feet until we get to 0 feet.\nLet's write down the sequence:\n45, 40, 35, 30, 25, 20, 15, 10, 5, 0\nThe sequence stops at 0 feet. The number of seconds it takes to stop is 9 (since 0 feet is reached in the 9th second).\n### Step 2: Calculate the total distance traveled.\nWe can now calculate the total distance traveled. Since the car travels 5 feet less each second than the previous second, the distance traveled in each second is 40, 35, 30, ..., 5, 0 feet.\nThe total distance traveled is the sum of the distances traveled in each second. That is:\n45 + 40 + 35 + 30 + 25 + 20 + 15 + 10 + 5 = 215 feet",
        " \n###  Step 1: How many feet does the car  travel in each second? After the brakes are applied, it travels 5 feet less than before. It travels 45 feet in the first second. So in the next second it travels 45 - 5 = 40 feet. In the second after that, it travels 40 - 5 = 35 feet, and so on. In general, it travels 45 - 5k + 5 = 40 - 5k feet in the kth second.\n###  Step 2: How many seconds does it take for the car to stop? The car stops when it travels 0 feet, so it travels 0 feet in that second. It travels 5 feet less than the previous second, so it traveled 45 in the previous second. The car had traveled 40 feet in the second before that, so it traveled 45 - 5 = 40 feet in the second before that. Continuing in this way, we see that the car travels 45, 40, 35,  ...  in successive seconds. The pattern of the numbers is 45, 40, 35, ..., in which each number is 5 less than the one before. The last number in this pattern is 0, because it is the distance the car travels in the second it stops. There are six numbers in this pattern, so it takes six seconds for the car to stop.\n###  Step 3: How many feet does the car travel from the time  the brakes are applied to the time it stops? To find this distance, we add up the distances the car travels in all the seconds it travels. For the first second, it travels 45 feet. For the second second, it travels 40 feet. For the third, it travels 35 feet. For the fourth, it travels 30 feet. For the fifth, it travels 25 feet. And for the sixth, it travels 0 feet.\n###  Our answer is: The car travels 45 + 40 + 35 + 30 + 25 + 0 = 175 feet from the time it stops to the time the car stops.\nBut wait! This is how far the car travels in all the seconds it travels, including the second it stops. We are told that the distance is \"from the time the brakes are applied to the time the car stops\".
