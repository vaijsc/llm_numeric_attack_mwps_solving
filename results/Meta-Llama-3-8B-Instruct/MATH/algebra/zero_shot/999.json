        " Vanessa simplify $y = 2x+5$ by determining if we can take anything out of that equation.  $2x$ is the only $x$ in that expression; it is the only possible $$th \\that we \\could \\remove$.

Multiply both sides by 3: 0 = x + 21. Subtract 21 from both sides: x = -21. So the x-intercept of the first line is (-21, 0). Next find the x-intercept of the second line.
