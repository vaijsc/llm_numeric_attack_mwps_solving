If $x+1=0$, then $x=-1$, and if $x-4=0$, then $x=4$.  Therefore, the two possible values for $x$ are $-1$ and $4$.

        " $x=3+\\frac{1}{x}$.\nStep 1. The question states that $x$ is 3 larger than its reciprocal.  This means $x=\\frac{1}{x}+3$.  If we move the $\\frac{1}{x}$ to the right hand side, we get $$\\frac{1}{x}-x=3,$$ or $$\\frac{1}{x}-x-3=0$$ which is a quadratic in terms of $\\frac{1}{x}$.  If we can turn the equation into the form $ax^2+bx+c=0,$ then we can factor it and solve for $\\frac{1}{x}$.\nStep 2. We can do this by using the substitution $\\frac{1}{u} = x,$ and then move every term to the left-side.  The new equation would look like this: $$-u+u^2-3u^2=0$$ which simplifies to $u^2-3u^2+u=0$ $u(u-3)+1=0$ $$(u-3)(u+1)=0$$\nStep 3. This means we must have two solutions.  One of the solutions is $u=1$ (which is the same thing as $x=1$) and the other is $u=-3$ (which is the same thing as $x=-\\frac{1}{3}$).  \nStep 4.

Use the quadratic formula $x = \\frac{-b \\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$.  By solving the given equation $x=\\frac{1}{x}+3$ you will find that the square of $x$ equals $3x+\\frac{1}{x}$.

In this case we can see the appearance of the trace which makes this problem especially complex, but it is not impossible to attempt to prove this statement. By seeing this problem as an equation in the form $x=\\frac{1}{x}+3$, we have found that the expression is equal to $x^2-3x-1=0$. However at this point we cannot be certain of the answer without deriving the equation for $x$ as $x^2-3x-1=0$. This means we must find the roots of the equation, recall that this can be done with the quadratic formula $x = \\frac{-b \\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$, the $x$ we\u2019re solving for is $a$, which is $1$ in this case.
