So, the key to solving such questions is that the degree of a product of two polynomials is the sum of the degrees of the two polynomials, if it exists.  \nIn this problem, $(x-1)$ is a linear polynomial and $f(x)$ is a polynomial of some degree. The degree of $(x-1)$ is 1, so if the product of $(x-1)$ and $f(x)$ is a polynomial, then the degree of $f(x)$ must be 4, because the degree of a product is the sum of the degrees, if it exists.

So the highest power of $x$ of $(x-1)f(x)$ has to be the highest power of $x$ of $3x^4+x^3-25x^2+38x-17$. Since $(x-1)f(x)$ must also equal $f(x)+f(x)(x-1)-f(x)$, it must be the case that $f(x)$ has the same highest power of $x$ as $(x-1)f(x)=3x^4+x^3-25x^2+38x-17$. Therefore, the highest power of $x$ must be the fourth power.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 4. I hope it is correct.

I tried doing the same thing, but I ended up with a polynomial that doesn't have to be true. Did I miss something? The key step that I missed is to directly factor out $\\dfrac{3x^4+x^3 - 25x^2 +38x -17}{x-1}$ ((Notice that $3x^4+x^3 - 25x^2 +38x -17$ is already the result of a polynomial multiplication, with coefficients $1\\cdot 3$, $1\\cdot 1$, $-25\\cdot 1$, and $38\\cdot 1-\\boxed{17\\cdot 1}$))\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 4. I hope it is correct. Steven Berg #### Steven Berg's Solution: The given equation $(x-1)f(x)=3x^4+x^3 - 25x^2 +38x -17$ can be rearranged as $$f(x) = \\frac{3x^4+x^3 - 25x^2 +38x -17}{x-1}$$ At this point, we know that $f(x)$ is a polynomial if the polynomial $3x^4+x^3 - 25x^2 +38x -17$ is divisible by $x-1$.

        " I know how to approach this question, but I don't know what the final answer is. So I will ask another question.

Your explanation was very clear and really helpful. It seems that this solution is based on the fact that the degree of any polynomial expression of a polynomial is the same as the degree of the polynomial itself.

This can be useful when h(x) is of a higher degree than g(x). In this case, we can then write g(x) as (x - r)q(x) + r, where r is the remainder.2. **Use polynomial long division with remainder:** Another method is to use the remainder theorem to rewrite g(x) as (x - r)q(x) + r.
