        " x=\\frac{2}{3}\n#### Solution 1\nNow we can let $y=9x^2 - 18x - 16$ and consider solving both polynomials for $x$ at the same time. We obtain, from the first polynomial, \\begin{displaymath}y&=9x^2 - 18x - 16\\\\&=(3x-4)(3x+4)\\end{displaymath}\nand from the second polynomial, \\begin{displaymath}y&=15x^2 + 28x + 12\\\\&=(3x+4)(5x+3),\\end{displaymath}where we factor both polynomials by grouping terms.

        " First, write the equation $9x^2 - 18x - 16 = 0$ in vertex form:  $9(x-1)^2+5=0.$ $x$ cannot be $1$ or the square root of 5 ( gravitational constant? chinese martial arts? what\u2019s involved in AP exam?). So, the vertex of the parabola must be the one of $15x^2 + 28x + 12 = 0$ because it has the same discriminant. We can rewrite $15x^2 + 28x + 12 = 0$ in vertex form:  $15(x+\\frac{2}{5})^2-\\frac{44}{5}=0,$ which tells us that the vertex is $-2/5$. Note that $9(-2/5)^2-18(-2/5)-16=0$.

        " \nSolve the first equation for $x$ to find\n\\begin{align*}\n0 &= 9x^2 - 18x - 16\\\\\n&= 3x(3x - 6) - 16\\\\\n&= (3x - 4)(3x - 4)\\\\\n&= (3x - 4)^2.\n\\end{align*}This means that $3x - 4 = 0$, or $x = 4/3$.

Determine that the polynomial $9x^2 - 18x - 16$ factors as $(3x - 2)^2 - 20$, and then set its value equal to zero, obtaining $(3x - 2)^2 = 20$ or $(3x - 2)^2 = 4^2$.

The only rational root in this problem is $x=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}$. Note that $x=-\\frac{2}{3}$ is also the root of the other quadratic, which is equivalent to checking that the linear factors have a common root. We can check this by factoring $15x^2+28x+12$ as $(3x+4)(5x+3)$ and checking that $(3x+4)(5x+3)(3x-2) = 3x(5x-4)(x+2)$ is divisible by $x+\\frac{2}{3}$.\n### Error in the Solution: \nNone that I have found.\n### Alternative Solution: \nWe have the system of equations: \\begin{align*}\n9x^2 - 18x - 16 &= 0\\\\",

        " \nWe first have to use the quadratic formula to find the value of $x$ such that $9x^2 - 18x - 16 = 0$. \n$$x = \\frac{-(-18) \\pm \\sqrt{(-18)^2 - 4\\cdot9\\cdot(-16)}}{2\\cdot9} = \\frac{18 \\pm \\sqrt{324 + 576}}{18} = \\frac{18 \\pm 6\\sqrt{10}}{18} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{10}}{2}$$\nNow, $15x^2 + 28x + 12 = 0$ so let\u2019s plug in these $x$-values:\n$$\\left(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{10}}{2}\\right)^2 + \\frac{28}{15} \\left(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{10}}{2}\\right) + \\frac{12}{15} = \\frac{1+2\\sqrt{10}+10}{4} + \\frac{14+14\\sqrt{10}}{15} + \\frac{8}{15} = 1+\\sqrt{10}+\\frac{22+14\\sqrt{10}}{15}$$\n$$\\left(\\frac{1-\\sqrt{10}}{2}\\right)^2 + \\frac{28}{15} \\left(\\frac{1-\\sqrt{10}}{2}\\right) + \\frac{12}{15} = \\frac{1-2\\sqrt{10}+10}{4} + \\frac{-14+14\\sqrt{10}}{15} + \\frac{8}{15} = 1-\\sqrt{10}+\\frac{-6+14\\sqrt{10}}{15}$$\nSince both of these should equal $0$, we can equate corresponding terms and get:\n$$1+\\frac{22+14\\sqrt{10}}{15} = 1-\\sqrt{10}+\\frac{-6+14\\sqrt{10}}{15}$$\n$$\\frac{22+14\\sqrt{10}}{15} = -\\frac{\\sqrt{10}}{1} + \\frac{-6+14\\sqrt{10}}{15}$$\n$$22+14\\sqrt{10} = -30\\sqrt{10} - 6$$\n$$14\\sqrt{10}",
        " \nSince $x$ satisfies both equations, we can set each side equal to zero and set the equations equal to each other: \\begin{align*}\n9x^2 - 18x - 16 &= 15x^2 + 28x + 12\\\\\n-9x^2 + 6x + 4 &= 0\n\\end{align*}The expression $-9x^2 + 6x + 4$ factors as $$(3x - 1)(3x - 4)$$ so it is equal to zero when $$x = \\frac{1}{3} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x = \\frac{4}{3}.$$However, we are interested in the value of $x$ that satisfies both equations, so only one of the above values of $x$ must be the solution to the original problem. Plugging the two possible values of $x$ into each of the original problems, we find that $x = \\boxed{\\frac{4}{3}}.$ is the only solution.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\frac{4}{3}.

        "  Let\u2019s consider the given equations. We have $9x^2-18x-16=0$ and $15x^2+28x+12=0$. Now, let $a=9x^2-18x-16$. After simplifying, we get $a=(3x-8)(3x+2)=0$. So, we have $(3x-8)(3x+2)=0$. Thus, we have $3x-8=0\\implies 3x=8\\implies x=\\frac{8}{3}$ or $3x+2=0\\implies 3x=-2\\implies x=-\\frac{2}{3}$. \\\\Hence, $x=\\frac{8}{3}$ or $x=-\\frac{2}{3}$. Importantly, let\u2019s try both solutions in the second equation.\\\\ We have $15x^2+28x+12=0$. We have 15x^2+28x+12=15(\\frac{8}{3})^2+28\\frac{8}{3}+12=160+96+12=268. Now, x=-\\frac{2}{3}. 15(\\frac{-2}{3})^2+28(-\\frac{2}{3})+12=\\frac{-40}{9}-\\frac{-16}{1}+12=16. If the equation 15x^2+28x+12=0 is satisfied, then the value of $x$ will be either $\\frac{8}{3}$ or $-\\frac{2}{3}$. Now, we have to write the answer in the simplest form in $x=\\frac{8}{3}$ form.\\\\Hence, the value of $x$ is $\\frac{8}{3}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\frac{8}{3}.
