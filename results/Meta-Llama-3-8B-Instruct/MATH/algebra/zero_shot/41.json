        " $b = \\boxed{4}$\nWe know the line equation is $3x + 2y = 12.$ And $a$ is 4. We have the equation now:\n$3(4) + 2y = 12$\n$12 + 2y = 12$\n$2y = 0$\n$y = 0$\nSo the answer is $b = \\boxed{4}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 4. I hope it is correct. Attention students! Don't forget to check the answers and cases the problem requires! Otherwise, be prepared to revise! Good luck!\nNote that in the problem, it is asking for the value of b when a = 4, so we can plug a = 4 into the equation, and we get 3(4) + 2b = 12. 12 + 2b = 12 can be simplified to 2b = 0, and then we get b = 0. However, the original problem statement tells us that the point (a, b) lies on the line with equation 3x + 2y = 12. Since a = 4, we know that 3(4) + 2b = 12, or 12 + 2b = 12. And when we subtract 12 from both sides, we get 2b = 0, which means b = 0. So in this case, b is indeed 0. But what if you substitute the value of b into the original equation and get an error? Because there may be some missing information or minor typo in the problem, so it's always a good idea to double-check your work. So a more correct way to solve this problem would be to use the given equation 3x + 2y = 12 to find the value of b. Think you can do that? Are you ready to give it a try? I hope this helps.

        " Let\u2019s start by writing the equation in the form $y=mx+c$ (which is the form you see in graphs). $$3x+2y=12$$ $$2y=-3x+12$$ Add 3x to both sides. $$y=-\\frac{3}{2}x+6$$ (This is our y-intercept form.) In this form, we can see that our slope is $m=-\\frac{3}{2}$. $$y=-\\frac{3}{2}x+6$$ We can pick up where we left off. $$y=-\\frac{3}{2}x+6$$ Since a = 4 and we want to solve for b. $$b=-\\frac{3}{2} \\cdot 4 + 6$$ $$b=-3+6$$ $$b=3$$ Thus, the answer is 3. When a = 4, b = 3. ### Example: Find the value of y when x = 2 in the equation 2x + 5y = 16. To find y, we can plug in what we know into the equation. $$2(2)+5y=16$$ Add 2 to both sides. $$4+5y=16$$ Subtract 4 from both sides. $$5y=12$$ Divide both sides by 5. $$y=\\frac{12}{5}$$ Thus, the answer is $\\frac{12}{5}$.\n### Categories:\n    - # solution # math # problem-solving # algebra # line",
        " First, we get the value of $b$. This is the easiest way, using $x = 4$, so $12 = 3(4) + 2b$. Iff $2b = 12 - 12 = 0$.
