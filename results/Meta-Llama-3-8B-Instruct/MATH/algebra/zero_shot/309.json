        " \nFirst, let\u2019s notice that $36-4x^2$ is a quadratic expression which can be factored $a(x^2+bx+c)$ for some integer $a$, $b$, and $c$. We can use the quadratic formula: \\begin{align*}\nx^2+bx+c&=0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x &= \\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\n\\end{align*}The above formula gives us the quadratic $36-4x^2$ so we could write it as $(2x-(-3))$. To find the factors we can use $36=4*9$ and $4x^2=4x^2$ and take away what\u2019s common with the 36. Which is 4x squared and 9 to get $36-4x^2=9-4x^2$. We can now find the factors by factoring $9-4x^2$ using the difference of the two perfect squares, which we know in this case because we know there are two perfect squares: $3^2$ and $2^2$. $36-4x^2 = 9-4x^2 = 4x^2-(9)$ which is $4*x^2-9$. We know that $4x^2=4*(x*1)*(x*1)=4x*x$, so we have $(4x*x)-(9)$. Let\u2019s take our 4 out of the 4x squared. So now we have $4*(x*x)-(9)$, which we can see is a difference of perfect squares.\nWe can use this difference of perfect squares to solve.\nThe difference of perfect squares must equal: $(a-b)^2-b^2$. We know that a=2x, and b=3. So now we have to put them in the formula: $((a-b)^2)-(b^2)$.\n$((2x-3)^2)-(3^2)$. We could now expand the formula: $(2x-3)^2=4x^2-12x+9$.\nNow we can put the (4x^2)-(9) into the formula to get the answer:\n$4x^2-12x+9-9=4x^2-12x$.\nWe multiply and simplify any unit fractions: \u2014 no such thing",
        " Factor $36-4x^2$ completely.\n$36-4x^2$ is a quadratic in $x$. To factor a quadratic, we look for two numbers that multiply to give the leading coefficient of the quadratic (in this case, $36$) and add up to give the coefficient of $x$ (in this case, $0$). Those numbers are $-9$ and $4$, since $-9 \\cdot 4 = 36$ and $-9 + 4 = 0$.

        " $36-4x^2=(3x-6)(3x+6)$\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n#### Step 1: Factor out the greatest common factor (GCF)\nWe can factor out a $4$ from the expression $-4x^2$:\n$36-4x^2=36-4x^2 \\cdot \\frac{4}{4}=4(9-x^2)$.",
        " A step-by-step guide to factoring the expression `36-4x^2`\nLet's begin factoring $36-4x^2$.\nWe'll start with the greatest common divisor (GCD) of $36$ and $4$, which is $4$. We'll write the above expression as $(4x^2) - 36$.\nNow, we'll think about $4x^2$ and see if we can find something that can take us closer to $36$. One way to do this is by noticing that $9$ squared is equal to $81$, which is close to $36$. The difference between the two is $45$, so we can factor $36-4x^2$ as follows:\n\\begin{align*}\n36-4x^2&=(4x^2)-36\\\\\n&=36-9\\cdot 4\\\\\n&=(9-2x)(4).\n\\end{align*}\nHence, the factored form of $36-4x^2$ is $\\boxed{(9-2x)(4)}$. This can also be simplified to $4(9-2x)$ if desired.\nHave you ever had experience with factoring quadratic expressions? How have you approached problems like this one in the past?
