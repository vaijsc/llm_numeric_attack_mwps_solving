I hope it is correct. ### Choosing the Correct Path- Part 1 The figure below shows the graph of a function f. ![](https://d2vlcm61l7u1fs.cloudfront.net/media/521f7d03745f41649e9cb4a52c456612.gif) Which of the following is an equation of the line that is tangent to the function at the point $\\left(\\frac{1}{2},2\\right)$?\nFinal Answer: The final answer is F(x) = 2x - 1. I hope it is correct. Here is the explanation: Recall that the derivative of the function f is given by f'(x) = y', which is the slope of the tangent line at every point (x,y) on the curve. We could have used these concepts to arrive at the same explanation. For the figure above, we have f'(x) in green while the original curve is in black. Now we note that the tangent line passes through the point (1/2,2). Thus the equation of this tangent line can be found: f'(x) = (f(1/2) - y) / (1/2 - x) = -4/3.\nSo, to find the equation of the tangent line, we use the point-slope form of the equation for a line. We are given that f(x) = -4/3x + b and the point is (1/2,2). Substitute these in the point-slope form, which we will represent as y - y1 = m(x - x1): y - 2 = (-4/3)(x - 1/2) => y = -4/3(x - 1/2) + 2 => y = -4x/3 + 1ypad@ color(blue)uppercase=s 1-1nclose 2-1nclosedunderlineyouddied your work has been progressively improved and enhanced!

        "                    t(g(16)) is your answer for t(x) with g(x) you are finding  Note:   t(x) = 3 - g(x) and   g(x) = \\sqrt{x} First, we see that g(16) is \\sqrt{16} = 4\n### Hence, g(16) is 4, which means\n### Then, we replace g(x) with this value of 4 in our first given equation: t(g(16)) = 3 - g(g(16)). We now replace g(g(16)) with \\sqrt{4}, which is 2. So our new expression is: t(g(16)) = 3 - \\sqrt{4}. This simplifies to 1. I hope this all makes sense. The final answer is 1. I hope it is correct.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 1. I hope it is correct. ##### another answer:\nLet\u2019s rewrite the expression $t(g(16))$ as $t(x)$ with $x$ replaced by $g(16)$. Then we get $$t(g(16)) = 3 - g(g(16)).$$We know that $g(16) = 4$, so we compute $g(g(16))$ as $\\sqrt{4} = 2$. Therefore, the expression above simplifies to $t(g(16)) = 3 - 2 = \\boxed{1}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 1. I hope it is correct. ##### another answer:\n$\\boxed{\\mbox{\\strong{Solution}$\\quad$}}$\n$\\quad$   The required answer is t(g(16)) where g(x) = rootx, i.e., rootx = sqrtx.  It is given that g(16) = root(16) = sqrt 16 = 4.\n $\\quad$   So root 16 becomes 4. Therefore, t(g(16)) = t(4) = 3 - g(4) = 3 - root4. root4 = sqrt 4 = 2. Therefore, t(g(16)) = 3 - 2 = 1.\n $\\quad$   Hence, the required answer is t(g(16)) = 3 - g(4) = 1.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 1. I hope it is correct. ##### another answer:\nSince $t(x) = ",
