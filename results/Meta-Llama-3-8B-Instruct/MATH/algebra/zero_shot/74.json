        " If we expand the expression $2x(x-10)$, we get $2x(x)-20x=-50$. We can rearrange this to get the quadratic equation $2x^2-20x+50=0$. Then, by the quadratic formula, the roots of the equation are \n$$x=\\frac{20\\pm\\sqrt{400-400}}{4}=\\frac{20}{2}=\\boxed{10}$$ Therefore, the sum of all possible values of $x$ is $\\boxed{10}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 10.

By factoring 2 in the last radical, we would obtain $x = 10 \\pm \\sqrt{200}$ = $10 \\pm \\sqrt{100*2}$ = $10 \\pm 10 \\sqrt{2}$. Thus, $x$ equals either $10 - 10 \\sqrt{2}$ or $10 + 10 \\sqrt{2}$. Now, we are told to find the sum of these two values. That is, we need to calculate $10 - 10 \\sqrt{2}$ + $10 + 10 \\sqrt{2}$. By a common trick when neutral arithmetic operations are performed on like terms, we get $20$. There you have it, the sum of the possible values of $x$ is $20$. Now, let's look at the choices.

        " \nFirst, we take the equation $2x(x-10)=-50$ and distribute the $2$ to the inside to get $2x^2-20x+50$. Then we take this equation and move the $50$ terms to the right side to get $2x^2-20x=0$. Now we can factor the equation $2x(2x-20)=0$. So we can divide both terms by the expressions $2x$ and $(2x-20)$ to get $x=0$ or $x=10$. So our possible values of $x$ are $0$ and $10$.

        " To solve the given equation, we add 50 to both sides, which gives us $2x(x-10) = -50+50$, or $2x(x-10)=0$. (And remember, for any equation, we are ALWAYS told to check for extraneous solutions. Unfortunately, there are no extraneous solutions in this equation, so we do not need to do so in this problem.) Then, we factor the left side of the equation. \\begin{align*}\n2x(x-10)&=0\\\\\n2x(x-10)&=2x(x-10)\\\\\n2x(x-10)&=0\n\\end{align*}At this point, we would think that we would factor out an x. But let me ask, how can we factor out an $x$ if we are not allowed to assume that $x$ is positive? (In other words, we are not allowed to assume that $x\\ge0$. So, we need to be a little more careful.) \\begin{align*}\n2x(x-10)&=0\\\\\n2x(x-10)&=0+0\\\\\nx(x-10)&=0\\\\\nx(x-10)&=\\boxed{0}\n\\end{align*}So now we have $x(x-10)=0$. That is essentially saying the $x=0$ and $x-10=0$. It is not hard to check that these two statements are true. In other words, given these two statements, satisfy the statement $x(x-10)=0$. We can also easily check that $x=0$ and $x-10=0$ satisfy the statement $x(x-10)=0$. It is within our best interest to determine more information given these $x$\u2019s. The $x=0$ is an easy solution but difficult solution which we do not like. It is easier solution. Solving the 10-0=10 after a few minutes, we get 10=10. The only thing, then, to find is the only other number we need, $x+10$ given that $x+10=10$. The answer to that equation, after about a minute, is 0+10=10. Thus the 2 number solutions of this equation are $x=0$ and $x=10$. We are to find the sum of those numbers.\n### Solution:\n\\begin{align*}\nx(x",

This highlights the importance of combining different techniques and thinking carefully about an equation before relying solely on a single algorithm.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 0. I hope it is correct. BYJUS 2x(x - 10) = -50. Factoring the expression on the left-hand side, we have 2x(x - 10) = 2x(x - 5 - 5) = 2x(x - 5) - 10x = (2x^2 - 10x) - 10x = 2x^2 - 20x. Therefore, the equation 2x(x - 10) = -50 is equivalent to the quadratic equation 2x^2 - 20x + 50 = 0. To solve for x, we can factor this equation as follows: 2x^2 - 20x + 50 = 1(2x^2 - 20x + 50) = 1(2x^2 - 10x - 10x + 50) = 1[2x(x - 5) - 10(x - 5)] = (2x - 10)(x - 5).
