        " Well first you take the absolute value out which gives you |5x-1|=|3x+2|\nand we know absolute value is always positive or zero, so let's split it two cases: $$5x-1=3x+2 \\qquad\\text{or}\\qquad 5x-1=-(3x+2).$$For the first case, if we solve for $x$, we get:\n\\begin{align*}\n5x-1&=3x+2\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 2x&=3\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x&=3/2\n\\end{align*}In the second case, if we solve for $x$, we get:\n\\begin{align*}\n5x-1&=-(3x+2)\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 5x-1&=-3x-2\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 8x&=-1\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x&=-\\frac{1}{8}.\n\\end{align*}So, we see that $x=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}$ is the smallest solution.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 3/2. I hope it is correct.  Another possible solution would be $\\boxed{-\\frac{1}{8}}$, but this is greater than the other one if the two options give more than one solution.  Instead of doing this, you can use the absolute value to figure out solutions.  $|5x-1|=|3x+2|$ is something that you can do if you know absolute value.  It means $5x-1$ and $3x+2$ are either equal, or they are zero.  So first, the absolute value part will go away, and you'll get the same number.  But how can you make them equal?  That's hard, because you have to solve for $x$.  One way to get around this is to use a really common convention for $x$, let's say $x=-\\frac{1}{8}$.  This way, if you should find solutions, you're covered.  When it's time to find a solution, if $x=-\\frac{1}{8}$ is the answer to the question you never are left with more solutions because no one makes a bigger one no matter what you are doing.

        " This could be a harder question if someone does not look at the options at the start. Definitely look at the answer choices now.\nHere is the solution.\nTo solve for x, we can start with the original equation: |5x-1|=|3x+2|. The first thing to do is get rid of the absolute value signs because the absolute value is calculated only as the distance from the number to 0.\nThe distance from a to 0 is the same as the distance from -a to 0. Now, let\u2019s adjust the right side to make it the same as the left side:\n|5x - 1| = |-(3x + 2)|\nThis gives us:\n|5x - 1| = |-3x-2| \nThis gives us:\n5x - 1 = -3x - 2 \nand \n- 5x + 1 = 3x + 2\nNow let\u2019s get our x by itself:\n8x = -3 or \n5x = 3\nx = -3/8 or \nx = 3/5\nLooking at our options, we know the smallest value of x is 3/5. So, our answer is 3/5. "
