I hope it is correct. 1 Hello! I noticed you are solving for the square root of 3x+6 = x+2, congratulations! In your solution, you did your steps correctly, but in your final answer, I see -\\frac{1}{2} is less than -1. So, we need to reorder the numbers from least to greatest. Here's the corrected final answer: -1,\\frac{1}{2}. 2 Could you explain why we need to reorder the numbers? I'm trying to learn. Reordering is necessary when there are multiple solutions, and we want them to appear in a specific order. In this case, we are asked to order the solutions from least to greatest. To do this, we compare each solution to see which one is smaller. If the comparison gives us a true statement, we can move the larger one to the right of the smaller one. The correct order ensures that the smallest solution is first and the largest solution is last, following the original instruction: \"Order them from least to greatest, separated by comma(s)\". If we just write -\\frac{1}{2} and -1, it's like mixing up the alphabet without considering the order. In this case, we need to put the more negative number (-1) to the left and the less negative",
