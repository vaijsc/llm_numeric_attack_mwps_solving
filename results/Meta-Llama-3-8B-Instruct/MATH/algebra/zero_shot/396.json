Such a partition defines a coloring $C:\\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{P} = \\{0,1\\}$, i.e. a function $C:\\mathds{N} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{P}$ where $\\mathcal{P} = \\{0,1\\}$. Notice that each integer bit can be colored 1 of the 2 colors.\n##Number of Partitions\nLet $n$ be any positive integer. The number of partitions of $n$ is the number of ways we can write $n$ as a sum of positive integers, ignoring order and allowing $k$ in $0^n$ and $n$ in the sum, that is\n$$n =_{+} k_1 + k_2 + \\ldots.$$\nLet $p(n)$ be the number of partitions that are partitions of $n$, i.e. $p(n)$ is an integer which is the number of partitions of $n$.  The number of partitions of a positive integer $n$, can be found by counting the number of ways coloring the integers $1 to n$, up to this point.\nThe following Table lists the partitions of a range of positive integers:\n\\begin{align*}\\begin{array}{ccc} n& : & \\mbox{Partitions of $n$} \\\\ \\hline 1 & : & 1 \\\\ 2 & : & 2 \\\\ 3 & : & 3 \\\\ 4 & : & 5 \\\\ ",

        " $\\frac{7}{30}@\\frac{10}{21}$ is first expressed as$$(7)(10)\\left(\\frac{21}{30}\\right).$$Next, the numbers are multipled together $(7)(10)=70$ to get$$(70)\\left(\\frac{21}{30}\\right).$$Now we simplify by performing the division to get$$\\frac{70}{30},$$ and finally simplify to get$\\frac{7}{3}.$Which is the final answer. Your result is$\\boxed{\\frac{7}{3}}$.Final Answer: The final answer is \\frac{7}{3}. I hope it is correct. #### Please do not customize the latex fields as some formatting may get lost during the process.  Mandatory Can you please solve using the explicit formula for mixed numbers?  Optional explanation optional response text box for feedback. First, I will write $\\frac{7}{30}$ as a mixed number by converting it to an improper fraction, which is $\\frac{7\\cdot30}{30}=\\frac{210}{30}=7$.  Then, I will convert $\\frac{10}{21}$ to a mixed number as well.  I will convert it to an improper fraction, which is $\\frac{10\\cdot21}{21}=\\frac{210}{21}=10$.  Since $\\frac{7}{3}=7+\\frac{1}{3}$ and $\\frac{10}{3}=10+\\frac{1}{3}$, I can evaluate the expression $\\frac{7}{3}@\\frac{10}{3}$ using the formula for the multiplication of two mixed numbers as $(a+\\frac{b}{c})(d+\\frac{e}{f})=ad+\\frac{ad}{f}+b\\frac{d}{c}+abe/(\\em)\\em)\\em)f)f$.  Using this formula, I will rewrite $\\frac{7}{3}@\\frac{10}{3}$ as $(7)+\\frac{1}{3})\\em)\\em(10)+\\frac{1}{3}\\frac{)=}{).$ Now, it will be easier for me to multiply the two whole numbers to get $70$.  Next, I will multiply $7$ and $10$ to get $70$, so I will have$70+\\frac{70}{3}+7+\\frac{10}{3}\\frac{=\\frac{70\\cdot21}{3}}{=========",
        " To compute the value of $\\frac{7}{30}@\\frac{10}{21}$ we multiply the two fractions and divide by the denominator of one fraction. In this case, this means we will multiply the fractions, then divide by 30. Examining the product of the two fractions:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{7}{30}@\\frac{10}{21} &= (7)(10)\\left(\\frac{21}{30}\\right)\\\\\n&= (7)(10)\\left(\\frac{7}{10}\\right)\\\\\n&= (7)(7)\\\\\n&= 49\n\\end{align*} Hence, the final answer is $$\\frac{7}{30}@\\frac{10}{21} = \\boxed{49}.$$ ###### Add comment Add Comment.

        " \\frac{7}{30}@\\frac{10}{21}\nWe have to write those fractions as mixed numbers, and then multiply in the numerator.  Thus we have:$$\\frac{7}{30}@\\frac{10}{21} = \\frac{(7)(10)}{(30)(21)}$$.\nNow, to multiply 7 and 10 in the numerator, we get 70.\nNow we have to multiply 30 and 21.  30 * 21 is equal to 630.\nSo, we have $\\frac{7}{30}@\\frac{10}{21} = \\frac{70}{630}$.
