        " The given quadratic equation is $3x^2 + 4x + c=0$.\n\u2022 To find the value of $c$ which will give us exactly one solution for $x$, we should make the discriminant $(-4)^2 - 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot c = 0.$\n\u2022 This gives $16 - 12c = 0$ which means $12c = 16.$ Finally, $c = \\boxed{\\frac{4}{3}}.$",
        " \nFirst, we can simplify the quadratic $3x^2+4x+c=0$ by completing the square.\nWe have $$\\begin{array}{rcl} 3x^2+4x+c&=&3\\left(\\left(x+\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2-\\frac{4}{3}+\\frac{c}{3}\\right)\\\\ &=&3\\left(\\left(x+\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2-\\frac{4}{3}+\\frac{c}{3}\\right)\\\\ &=&3\\left(x+\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2+3\\left(\\frac{c}{3}-\\frac{4}{3}\\right)\\\\ &=&3\\left(x+\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2+3\\left(c-4\\right). \\end{array}$$\nFor $3\\left(x+\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2+3\\left(c-4\\right)=0$, we must have $x+\\frac{2}{3}=0$, which implies $x=-\\frac{2}{3}$. Therefore, we must have $3\\left(c-4\\right)=0 \\Rightarrow c=\\boxed{4}$.\nThis way of thinking about this might not be immediately intuitive, but it allows you to recognize that the exact \\emph{unique solution} for $x$ occurs whenever the sum of the absolute values of the $x$-intercepts is equal to the absolute value of the $y$-intercept, which in this case must be $0=|-2/3|=2/3$. Hence, $c=4$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 4. I hope it is correct. \n(PS: I made an error earlier)\nPlease support me by liking the post and sharing it.
