        "To determine the values of \\( c \\) such that the equation \\( x^2 - 7x + c = 0 \\) has real and rational roots, we can use the discriminant of a quadratic equation.\nThe general form of a quadratic equation is \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\).

        "To solve this problem, we can use Vieta\u2019s formula.\nSince a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c$ has rational roots if and only if the coefficients are rational, we are assuming that $a, b$, and $c$ are all rational. For a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c$ with rational coefficients to have only rational roots, the discriminant $b^2 - 4ac$ must be a perfect square.\nIn our case, the quadratic equation is $x^2 - 7x + c = 0$, so we have $a = 1$, $b = -7$, and $c$ is a rational number. Therefore, the discriminant is\nB^2 - 4ac = (-7)^2 - 4c = 49 - 4c,\nwhich must be a perfect square. Since $c$ is a rational number, let\u2019s say it is equal to $\\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are integers. Therefore, the discriminant can be expressed as \\frac{49p - 4q}{q}.\nTo make this a perfect square, we have\n49p - 4q = m^2, where $m$ is an integer.\nClearing the denominators, we can rewrite the previous equation as:\n49p = 4q + m^2. Now, rewrite the equation as:\n49p = m^2 + 4(12q).\nFactoring out $m^2$ on the right-hand side, we can write\nm^2(49/p + 1/3) = m^2,\nwhich is true if and only if\n49/p + 1/3 = 1.\nCross-multiplying, we can get:\n7p + 3 = p,\nwhich implies $6p = 3$, so $p = 1/2$. Therefore, we have\nc = p/q = 1/(2q).\nNow we need to find all the rational numbers $q$ that satisfy the above equation, ensuring that $c$ is positive. Setting $q = 1$, we get $c = 1/2$. However, $c$ must be positive, so $q \\ge 2$. If $q = 2$, we get $c = 1/4$, which is positive. If $q = 3$, we get $c = 1/6$,",
        " Now let's start working on this problem!\nStep 1: We must find out when the roots of the quadratic equation are real and rational.\nTo ensure the roots to be real, the discriminant must be non-negative.

        " The equation $x^2-7x+c=0$ only has real and rational roots if its discriminant is a perfect square. To see this, let $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ be the roots of this equation.

        " We know that there are rational roots if and only if the coefficients of the polynomial are both a product of distinct primes. Thus, we need to know the prime factorization of $c$. To do that, we use the quadratic formula with $x=7\\pm\\sqrt{49-4c}$ and see that the discriminant $49-4c$ must be a perfect square, since the roots are rational. Therefore, $49-4c=d^2$ for some positive integer $d$. Now, $49$ is not divisible by $4$, so we factor $49$ as follows: $49=(7)(7)=7^2+0^2$. Since $0^2=0$, we need to have $0$ in the GCF of $49-4c$ and $d^2$ for this sum to be $0$, and it isn\u2019t hard to see that $49-4c$ and $d^2$ are divisible by $7$, but not both by $7^2$.

To factor 49, we use the formula $a^2+b^2$:\n$49=7^2+0^2$\nSo, 0 must be in the GCF of $49-4c$ and $d^2$.

From the quadratic formula,\n\\begin{align*}\nx &= \\frac{7 \\pm \\sqrt{49-4c}}{2}\\\\\n= \\frac{7 \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{49-4c}}{\\sqrt{49-4c}}}{2}\\\\\n= \\frac{7 \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{49-4c}{49-4c}}}{2}\n\\end{align*}\nwhere $\\frac{49-4c}{49-4c}$ is a positive rational number. Now, $\\frac{7 \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{49-4c}{49-4c}}}{2}$ is rational. This implies that $\\sqrt{\\frac{49-4c}{49-4c}}$ is an integer. There are only two values that we can have:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sqrt{49-4c}&=1\\\\\n49-4c&=1\\\\\nc&=\\frac{48}{4}=12\\\\\n\\sqrt{49-4c}&=-1\n\\end{align*}\nHowever, $\\sqrt{49-4c} \\neq -1$ since $49-4c$ cannot be negative in Case 3. Therefore, we only have $c=12$.\nNow we found one solution. Since $c=12$ works, we know that $c$ cannot be smaller than $12$. We return to the third case: $c < \\frac{49}{",
        " Since this is a quadratic equation with rational coefficients, the roots are either rational or irrational conjugates (note: this is because the zeroes are symmetric around the center of a parabola). Therefore, to ensure that our roots are both rational, we need that $x^2-7x+c$ has no irrational zeroes.\nThe Quadratic Formula shows that the roots of the equation are $x=\\frac{7\\pm\\sqrt{49-4c}}{2}$. For these roots to be rational, we must have that $\\sqrt{49-4c}$ is rational. Since $49-4c$ is a perfect square, it follows that $c$ is an integer.\nIn other words, we need that there exists a rational number $k$ such that $49-4c=k^2$. If $k$ is a perfect square, then $k^2=49$, and so $c=\\frac{1}{4}\\cdot (49-49)=0$. This is not a valid solution. Otherwise, $k=\\sqrt{49-4c}$ is irrational, and so is the root.\nFrom the factored form $49-4c=k^2$, we see that $49-4c$ must be the square of a positive integer. This gives $49-4c=a^2$, where $a=1,2,\\ldots,7$. We then solve for $c$ in each case:\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\begin{cases}\n0=A&B\\\\\n49-4c=\\boxed{0}\\\\\n&\\\\\n0=A+BH\n&&49-4c=1\\\\\n& \\ \\ 1H=49-4c\n&&\\downarrow\\\\\n&\\vdots&&\\ \\ 1H=49\\\\\n&&49=4c+1&&4c=49-1=48\\\\\n&&c=0\n&&c=12\\\\\n&\\ \\ 2H=49-4c\n&&\\downarrow\\\\\n&\\vdots&&\\ \\ 2H=49\\\\\n&&49=4c+4&&4c=49-4=45\\\\\n&&c=0\n&&c=11.25\n\\end{cases}\n\\end{align*}Hence, we find that $c$ can equal $0$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $5$, $6$, $7$, $8$,",

        "1\nThe equation has real rational roots only if both roots are rational (hence conjugate), and at least one of the roots are rational. This is if the discriminant $D$ is a perfect square. Computing $D = 49 - 4c,$ we want $D = k^2$ for some $k$ integer. Let $k = \\pm\\ell$ for $\\ell$ an integer. Then, $49 = \\ell^2 + 4c,$ or $c = \\frac{\\ell^2 - 49}{4}.$ In order for $c$ to be positive, $\\ell^2 > 49.$ Leading to prime factorizations, $\\ell$ can be 11, 13, 17, 19, and so on. Therefore, the possible values of $c$ are $c_1 = \\frac{121-49}{4} = 6$, $c_2 = \\frac{169-49}{4} = 10$, $c_3 = \\frac{289-49}{4} = 20$, and so on. These values are $6, 10, 20, \\dots$.

Since the equation will have real and rational roots when $D\\geq 0$, $49/4$ is the only possible $c$ which satisfies the restriction.

        " The equation $x^2-7x+c=0$ only has roots that are real and rational when the discriminant $b^2-4ac$, where $a=1$, $b=-7$ and $c$, is non-negative and is the square of an integer. In other words, \\begin{align*}\n(-7)^2-4(1)c &\\ge 0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad 49-4c &\\ge 0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad 4c &\\le 49\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad c &\\le 49/4=12.25\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $c$ must be an integer from 0 to 12, inclusive. The discriminant must also be the square of an integer, that is, $b^2-4ac=m^2$, where $m$ is some integer. We check the possible values of $c$ for this condition: \\begin{itemize}\n\\item When $c=0$, $b^2-4ac=m^2$ reduces to $m^2=49\\Rightarrow m=7$ or $m=-7$, which is not valid since $b=-7$.\n\\item When $c=1$, $b^2-4ac=m^2$ reduces to $m^2=45$, which does not have a rational solution.\n\\item When $c=4$, $b^2-4ac=m^2$ reduces to $m^2=9$, which has $m=\\pm3$ as a solution.\n\\item When $c=9$, $b^2-4ac=m^2$ reduces to $m^2=1$, which has $m=\\pm1$ as a solution.\n\\item When $c=36$, $b^2-4ac=m^2$ reduces to $m^2=13$, which does not have a rational solution.\n\\item When $c=48$, $b^2-4ac=m^2$ reduces to $m^2=0$, which is invalid since $b=-7$.\n\\end{itemize}Therefore, $c$ can take the values 4 and 9.

        " Let $a$ and $b$ be the roots. By Vieta\u2019s, we have that $x^2-7x+c=(x-a)(x-b)=x^2-(a+b)x+ab=c$, so $a+b=7$ and $ab=c$. If $a$ and $b$ are rational, then so is $c=ab$, and so if $c$ is non-rational, then $a$ and $b$ must be non-rational. If $a$ and $b$ are non-rational, then by the conjugate roots theorem for polynomials, $x^2-7x+c$ has no rational roots, and so can\u2019t equal $x^2-7x+c$.

Furthermore, since $a$ and $b$ are both rational, then so is their sum $a+b=7$, and $a$ and $b$ are integers because $a$ and $b$ are rational, and so is $a+b$.

        "step by step\nFirst, let us recall the fact that the roots of the equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ are only real and rational if the discriminant $b^2-4ac$ is a perfect square. (Why?)  In this case, $a=1, b=-7, c=c$, and so we need $(-7)^2-4c=49-4c$ to be a perfect square.\nNext, we need to find $c$ such that $49-4c$ is a perfect square.  It is obvious that $c$ cannot be greater than $\\frac{49}{4}$.  Let\u2019s try some values of $c$ to figure out which ones make $49-4c$ perfect squares.\n\u2022 If $c=0$, then $49-4c=49$ which is a perfect square.\n\u2022 If $c=1$, then $49-4c=45$ which is not a perfect square.  So, $c$ cannot be greater than 1 since it would give a larger number which is not a perfect square.\n\u2022 If $c=\\frac{49}{4}$, then $49-4c=0$ which is a perfect square.\nIn conclusion, the possible values of $c$ are $0$ and $\\frac{49}{4}$, and they can be expressed in decreasing order as $\\boxed{\\frac{49}{4}, 0}$.
