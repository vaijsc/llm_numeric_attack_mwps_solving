Which means that either $x-6=0$ or $x+4=0$. Then, $x=6$ or $x=-4$. So the denominator is zero whenever $x=6$ or $x=-4$.\n### Step 2: Determine any holes in the function.\nThe function $f(x)$ has a hole whenever $x=-4$ and $x=6$. (Why? We can divide the numerator and the denominator of the function by $x-6$)\n### Step 3: Determine the domain of the function.\nThe domain of $f(x)$ will be all numbers except $-4$ and $6$.

        " We first note that the function $f(x)=\\frac{x+2}{x^2-2x-24}$ is not defined when the denominator, $x^2-2x-24,$ is equal to zero.

This means the function $f$ is undefined when $x=4$ or $x=-3.$ The function $f$ is also defined for all real numbers other than $x=4$ and $x=-3$, because the denominator is a nonzero polynomial, and so it is never equal to zero for such values of $x$.

First, let's find the values of x for which the denominator is equal to zero. 2. We set the denominator equal to zero. So we get x2 \u2013 2x \u2013 24 = 0. 3. This is a quadratic formula which has a 0 on the right hand side. So we get (x + 6)(x \u2013 4) = 0. 4. So the values for which the denominator is zero is x = -6 or x = 4. 5. So we have to check what will happen when we put these values of x into the function. 6. When x = -6, we get 0. 7. When x = 4, we get 0. So we have to avoid these values of x. 8.

If we set $a^2+c-b^2=-24$, a convenient choice of $a,b$ is $(-4,3)$ because $(3)^2+(-4)^2=(-4+3)^2$, which makes factoring the quadratic easy.\nLet\u2019s simplify $x^2-2x-24$:\n$$\\begin{array}{rcl}\n\\displaystyle x^2-2x-24&=&x^2-2x+4^2-4^2-24\\\\\n&=& (x-4)(x+6).\n\\end{array}$$We now have factored $x^2-2x-24$.

The function has a clear domain, defined as all real numbers $x$ except those that make the denominator zero. Hence, if we find the zeros of the denominator $(x-8)(x+3),$ we can exclude them from the domain. Solving for zeros gives $x = 8$ and $x = -3,$ which are to be excluded. Thus, the domain is the interval set, $-\\infty,$ $-3,$ and $8,$ $\\infty$.

        " First, factorize the denominator:\nThe denominator is given by $x^2-2x-24$. So the question is how can we get back from this quadratic to $x+2$? These of course are the same:\n    - If we were to make $x+3$ into $(x+3)(x-8)$, do we start with $x+3$? No, because the $x+3$ we should keep will be the $x+2$ to be added to.\n    - If we were to make $x+3$ into $(x+4)(x-6)$, do we start with $x+3$? No, because the $x+4$ will be too small.\n    - Now we try $(x+6)(x-4)$. This $(x+6)$ will be the one we want since we should obtain $x+2$, which is only one unit smaller.\nSo, comparing denominators, we get $x^2-2x-24=(x+6)(x-4)$.
