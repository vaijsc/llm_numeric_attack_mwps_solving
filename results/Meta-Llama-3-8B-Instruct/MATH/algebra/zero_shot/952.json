        " First, we can re-write the sequence as $\\frac23+\\left[(q-1)d\\right]$, where $q$ represents the $q$-th term and $d$ represents the common difference.\nSince the first term is $\\frac23$, we can set $\\frac23+\\left[1\\right]d = \\frac23$, which means $d=0.$ However, since we cannot have a constant difference in an arithmetic sequence, we can realize that this is a contradiction.\nFrom this information, we can guess that the sequence must not have a constant difference.

The standard formula is $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d.$ Therefore, $a_9 = a_1 + 8d$ || $a_1 + 8d= \\frac{4}{5}.$ Since we know $a_1 = \\frac{2}{3},$ then $\\frac{2}{3} + 8d = \\frac{4}{5}$, or $\\frac{8}{15} = 8d.$ $$\\frac{1}{15} = d$$ Now, using the common difference we found, we can calculate $a_5$:\n$$a_5 = a_1 + 4d$$\n$$a_5 = \\frac{2}{3} + 4\\cdot\\frac{1}{15}$$\n$$a_5 = \\frac{2}{3} + \\frac{2}{15}$$\n$$a_5 = \\frac{6}{15} + \\frac{2}{15}$$\n$$a_5 = \\frac{8}{15}$$ $$a_5 = \\boxed{\\frac{8}{15}}$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\frac{8}{15}.
