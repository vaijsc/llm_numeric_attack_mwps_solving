Find the vertex.\nThe vertex of the parabola is given by the values of $x$ and $y$ for which the value of the parabola is a minimum or maximum, i.e., for which the derivative $y'$ attains either its minimum or maximum value. Since the initial equation is of the form $y=ax^2+bx+c$ with $a=-2<0$, we know that the maximum value of the parabola is at the vertex. The $x$-coordinate of the vertex is thus the value $x=m=-b/2a=-(-12)/2(-2)=3$. We obtain $y=n=-24$.",
        " m+n\n= The equation of this parabola is y = -2x^2 - 12x - 15. In standard form, the equation of a parabola is y = ax^2 + bx + c, where a, b, and c are real numbers and a is not zero. The vertex of this parabola is the minimum point of the curve. It is also the turning point. The x-coordinate of the turning point is the solution to the equation x = -b / a. We can write the equation as y = -2x^2 - 12x - 15. Comparing this to y = ax^2 + bx + c, we can see that a = -2, b = -12, and c = -15. The x-coordinate of the turning point is the solution to the equation x = -b / a. So we can write -12 / -2, which is 6. The y-coordinate of the turning point is the value of y when x = 6. Substituting x = 6 into the equation y = -2x^2 - 12x - 15, we can write y = -2 * 6^2 - 12 * 6 - 15. Simplifying this expression, we can write y = -2 * 36 - 72 - 15 = -72 - 15 = -87. So the vertex (minimum point) of the parabola is at the point (6, -87). m = 6, and n = -87. So m + n = 6 + (-87) = -81. The answer is -81.",

The vertex of a parabola is the point that is always at the lowest value (for a parabola opening upward) or the highest value (for a parabola opening downward). In the case of the parabola represented by the equation $y = -2x^2 - 12x - 15,$ we can rewrite it in vertex form, which is a form that makes it easy to identify the vertex. To do this, we complete the square on the $x$ term: \\begin{align*}\ny &= -2(x^2 + 6x) - 15\\\\\n&= -2(x^2 + 6x + 9) + 18 - 15\\\\\n&= -2(x+3)^2 + 3.\n\\end{align*}So, the vertex of the par",
        " to find the $x$ value of the vertex, we can use the vertex formula, which is $x=\\frac{-b}{2a}$ from here, we get $m=\\frac{-(-12)}{2(-2)}=\\frac{12}{-4}=-\\frac{3}{1}$\nto find the $y$ value of the vertex, we need to plug $m$ into the equation. $y=-2(-3)^2-12(-3)-15=-18-36-15=-69$, so $n=-69$\nnow $m+n=(-3)+(-69)=-72$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $-72$. I hope it is correct. ### Expression for the vertex The formula for the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of a parabola of the form $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ is $x = -\\frac{b}{2a}$. We need to use the formula for the $y$-coordinate $y = -69$, so $n=-69$ *Start by filling in this equation into the equation $y = -2x^{2} - 12x - 15.$ $$n = -69$$ $$-69 = -2(-3)^{2} - 12(-3) - 15$$ $$-69 = -2(9) + 36 - 15$$ $$-69 = -18 + 21$$ $$-69 = 3$$ It appears there is an error in the problem. We can't have $-69 = 3.$ *Instead, if we look at the equation $y = -2x^{2} - 12x - 15,$ we can determine if there are any possible extrema. *An important thing to note is that for a quadratic function to always be greater than or less than a number, we need to ensure that the parabola faces upwards or downwards and is shifted all the time. *The original equation was in standard vertex form, so the vertex does not shift. The parabola opens downwards. *The vertex must be the lowest point on the graph of the parabola. $$y = -2x^{2} - 12x - 15$$ $$y = -2(x^{2} + 6x) - 15$$ $$y = -2(x^{2} + 6x + 9) - 15 + 18$$ $$y",

However, in standard form, it is -2x^2 + 12x + 9.\nNow we assign the values of h and k. If a is equal to -2, and b is minus 12.\nClosing parenthesis with 1/2a.
