Because you are calculating it by the same order, but the order in which the operations are performed. So, it must be on both sides simultaneously.

Yet, this response is somewhat humorous and unidiomatic since a nonzero number and its additive inverse have different properties, as they are treated as separate real numbers, although as members of abelian groups.  For instance, $2$ and $-2$ can be treated, respectively, as $2(1+1)$ and $2(1-1)$ . However, because their absolute values are equal and their products with all nonzero real numbers are the same, you won't always need to keep their distinction, as they are typically treated as equivalent values, and the fundamental theorem of calculus particularly, gives a diffedit and happening mathematical negativity.
