Why do you think you are not a math enthusiast? A math enthusiast is someone who is interested in, passionate about, and appreciates mathematics.\nAccording to the context, the term for someone who is an expert in multiple branches of science and mathematics is often referred to as a polymath. A polymath is an individual with expertise in multiple fields, such as mathematics, physics, biology, and other disciplines. The term \"polymath\" comes from Greek, where \"poly\" means \"many\" and \"mathema\" means \"learning\". Polymaths are individuals who possess a broad range of knowledge and skills across multiple fields, often with a strong focus on interdisciplinary connections and applications. Unfortunately, the context did not mention any specific expertise in multiple branches of science and mathematics, but it did show a strong interest in solving mathematical problems, which could be a characteristic of a polymath.\n",

Please explain in detail.\nThe statement says that c and d are inversely proportional. Inverse variation can be understood in several ways. Here, we are told that c and d are being varied inversely, meaning that as one increases, the other decreases, and vice versa. For instance, in c = 9 and d = 8, as one increases (the value of c), the other falls (the value of d). There is no situation where c + d is conserved. In inverse variation, there is an added and equal but opposite slant as compared to direct variation (when one grows, the other grows, when one shrank, the other also shrinks).\nThis phenomenon can be observed in various aspects and can never be neutral. For instance, the angle of rotation of an aircraft depends directly on the airspeed of the plane. So, if one increases, the other also increases inversely. Similarly, the wavelength of lamper and speed of the ball when it hits the top of the trampoline, both are inversely proportional.
