Next, we can divide the entire equation by 200 to simplify it:\n   \\[\n   100A + 10M + C = \\frac{123400}{200}\n   \\]\n   Calculating the division:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{123400}{200} = 617\n   \\]\n   So we have:\n   \\[\n   100A + 10M + C = 617\n   \\]\n6.

        "  ### $123,422$ Sum of two $5$-digit numbers Dear Assistant, Hi! Great challenge! I need to find the sum of $AMC10$ and $AMC12$. To solve the puzzle, I need the value of $A$, $M$, and $C$. These numbers are five-digit numbers. $AMC10$ is a five-digit number, and $AMC12$ is also a five-digit number. The sum of $AMC10$ and $AMC12$ is $123,422$, which means that I can easily solve this puzzle by carefully examining $5$-digit numbers to find the pair of two $5$-digit numbers such that their sum is $123,422$. To begin, notice that $AMC$ can be at most $9999$. So let\u2019s assume that $AMC10 < 9999$. Now, let\u2019s check any five-digit number, for example: $14567$ and $MANDC$. We can add $14567+mandc$ to see if it is equal to $123,422$. However, $14567 + 12345 = 26812$ which is not equal to $123,422$. So we need to try another five-digit number, but remember $AMC10$ should be less than $9999$ if we assume $AMC10$ is less than $9999$. Now try: Let\u2019s say $AMC10$ and $AMC12$ are both in the last 1000. We shall try all the numbers until we find the pair of two $5$-digit numbers such that their sum is $123,422$. We know that $123,422$ has last 2 digits as $22$, so we shall examine last $2$ digits in our given sum to solve this puzzle. Let\u2019s look at the final $2$ digits of $123,422$ which are $22$. However, when we do $10000$ + $22$, we get $10022$. If we subtract $10022$ from $123,422$ we get $112400$, which is perfect because now we have $00022$, or to us it means that $AMC10$ is of the form $0000$. Let\u2019s check in the last $4$ digits of $122342$. We shall try to find last $4$ digits of the $AMC10$ here. Let\u2019s look for the pair of",

It follows that $$AMC<1000 \\quad\\text{and}\\quad AMC>10000.$$The latter inequality gives us that $C\\neq 0$, as otherwise $AMC<10000$.

        " Exercise 5\nAMC10 = 4 digits, and AMC12 = 5 digits. So when adding  the 2 together, we get a 6 digit number. 123422 after simplfying using the distributive property, gives a new set of identical digits in the last two places where AMC12 would originally be placed. So AMC12 must be 23982. Now, we have  miniacion 10 + 23982 = 123422. Solving for miniacion 10, we get minication 10 = 7974. So 4 digits of miniacion 10 and 5 digits of miniacion 12 are 7972. The sum is now...  (remove the first 8)79962=(A)M(C) To get the sum(AMC10)+(AMC12)=123422, or (A)M79962+(AMC12)=123422.  14(7996)=11188. So, (AMC12)=(11188-A)http Reuters Note: Norwegian Symbol.) Let MPC=lambda  11188-A.\nNow we have   $(A)M(79962)+ (11288-A) = 123422$\nLet $a=A$, $b=M$, and $c=C$ and simplify:  The sum (a)(b)(79962)+(11288-a)=123422\na(79962)+c(11288-a)\na(79962)+c11288-ac=123422\nNow apply steps for The algebraic method. Looking at (a)79962 the first step is bmapped washer 39239 ac=39239\nLet`s . In a. The precision. So I = 3 , step 3 = 0.6. So we want 12 be 123422 - 39239. I was 123,422,39239 = 842 factorial. And the last 2 digits are the same. so 39 and 2 will balance. (A)(M)(C) will be equal to 1and Then the remaining digits in the formula. A0. Then we have AMC^(1) .\nIf the AMC10 + AMC8 = 123422, you must have the AMC10 = 7974 and the AMC12 = 23982. Then the A + M + C number should be 7 + 2 + 8 = 17. So the answer would be 17.\nAnswer 17\n Correct 0",
        " AMC10+AMC12=123422\nSo, we are told that \\begin{align*}\nAMC10+AMC12&=123422\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad AM(C10+C12)&=123422\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad A M (20+12)&=123422\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad (A M)(32)&=123422\\\\\n\\end{align*}where $AM$ is the first 3 digits of $AMC10$ and $AMC12$.  Now, we must find $AM$ such that $AM\\cdot32=123422$.  Notice that $32=4\\cdot8$, so we can factor as follows: \\begin{align*}\nAM\\cdot32&=123422\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad(A\\cdot4)(M\\cdot8)&=123422\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad4A\\cdot8M&=123422\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 32AM&=123422\n\\end{align*}So we need some numbers $A,M$ whose product is $123422/32=3863.125$.  Since $3863$ doesn\u2019t divide evenly by $32$, we must round to 3863.  Then we multiply by $32$: \\begin{align*}\n32AM&=32\\cdot3863\\\\\n&=123416\\\\\n&=123422-6\\\\\n&=\\boxed{123422}\n\\end{align*}We must now determine what $AM$ is.  Working backwards, we see that $AM=123416/32=3863$.  Our two 5-digit numbers are $12346$ and $12376$.  The sum of these numbers is indeed 123422, making $A=1$, $M=2$ and $C=6$.

        " \nLet the five digits that make up AMC10 be $a, m,$ and $c$, so that $10,000a + 1,000m + 100c + 10 x + y = AMC10$ for some $x$ and $y$, with $0 \\le a, m, c, x \\le 9$ and $0 \\le y \\le 9$.  Similarly, let the five digits of AMC12 be $b, m,$ and $c$, so that $10,000b + 1,000m + 100c + 10z + v = AMC12$ for some $z$ and $v$, with $0 \\le b, m, c, z \\le 9$ and $0 \\le v \\le 9$.\nIf the sum of these two five-digit numbers is 123,422, then we have \\begin{align*}\nAMC10 + AMC12 &= 123,422 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow (10,000a + 1,000m + 100c + 10 x + y) + (10,000b + 1,000m + 100c + 10z + v) &= 123,422 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow 20,000m + 200c + 10x + 10y + 10z + v &= 123,422 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow 200c + 10x + 10y + 10z + v &= 123,422 - 20,000m.\n\\end{align*}This is a six-digit number, so the digit in the hundreds place of this number must be at least 1, and at most 9.  In particular, $c$ can\u2019t be 0.  To simplify our calculations, let\u2019s assume that $c$ is as large as possible, namely 9.  Then $200c = 1800$, so $1800 + 10x + 10y + 10z + v = 123,422 - 20,000m.$\nAs before, to make our calculations simpler, let\u2019s assume that $y$ and $z$ are as large as possible, namely 9.  Then $10y + 10z = 90$, so $1800 + 10x + 90 + v = 123,422 - 20,000m.$\nIn particular, $x \\le 21$,",
        " $A + M + C = 8$.\n First, let\u2019s assume that $A$ and $C$ are as different as possible by assuming they are as large as possible (that is, $A=9$ and $C=1$).  This gives a sum of $91012+91011=182023.$  But the numbers we are dealing with are five digits, so we can adjust this to get $91000+91112=182112.$  To reach 123422, we need to shift 10000 worth of value over to the other number, that is, add 1000 to the end of the other number.  So our numbers are $91000$ and $91212.$  This gives $A=M=C=\\boxed{9}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 8. I hope it is correct. Any errors or concerns, kindly let me know.

        " Because the two $5$-digit numbers have the same prefix in common, we can name them $A$-$n1$-$n2$ and $A$-$n1$-$n3$ for some numbers $n1$ and $n2$ and $n1$ and $n3$.  Now, we know that $A$-$n1$-$n2$ + $A$-$n1$-$n3$ = $123422$.  Let\u2019s rewrite that as\n$$A(10000 + 1000 + 10) + n1(1000 + 10) + (n2 + n3) = 123422.$$ This simplifies to\n$$A(11110) + n1(1010) + (n2 + n3) = 123422.$$Because the units digit, tens digit, and thousands digit of this equation all sum to $11$, we know that $A$ + $n1$ + $(n2 + n3)$ = $12$.  Further analysis shows that the only way for this to work is when $A = 9$, $n1 = 2$ and $n2 + n3 = 1$.  So, this implies that $n2 = 0$ and $n3 = 1$, or that $n2 = 1$ and $n3 = 0$.  Trying the possible values shows that the solution to the problem is $\\boxed{19}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 19. I hope it is correct.  ### 2018 AMC 12A, Problem 24\nFor some integer $k$, how many positive integer solutions does the equation $n^2 + 7n + 7 = k(2n + 1)$ have?  We use guess-and-check, noting that when $k = 1$, we get $n^2 + 7n + 7 = 2n + 1$, so $n^2 + 7n + 6 = 0$, so $(n + 3)(n + 2) = 0$, so $n = -3$ or $n = -2$. However, we already know that $n$ must be a positive integer, so this doesn't work.  We try $k = 2$ and get $n^2 + 7n + 7 = 4n + 2$, so",
        " Let\u2019s look at $AMC10$, say $abcd1$. Then, $MC12$ can only be $CD234$, so we have $123422 = abcd1 + CD234$, which is equivalent to $123422 = (a+b+c+d+1) + (250+24+3+2) = 10 + 250 + 29 = 1001 + 9$. Therefore, we know that $abcd1 = 1001$ and $CD234 = 289$. Using this, we have $A + M + C = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 5. I hope it is correct.  \n```\nfrom itertools import permutations\nfor p in permutations('0123456789'):\n    m = int(p[0] + p[1] + p[2] + p[3] + '0')\n    n = int(p[4] + p[5] + p[6] + p[7] + '2')\n    if m + n == 123422:\n        print(p[0] + p[1] + p[2], p[4] + p[5] + p[6])\n```\nIf you really want to be like Georg Cantor and formalize everything, you could implement this as a program. You would have to loop over all the 10-digit numbers, and check each pair.
