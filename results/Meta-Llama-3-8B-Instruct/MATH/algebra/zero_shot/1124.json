        " We want to find the value of $g(x)$. This function should satisfy: $$8x^4-7x^2+8x-7+g(x)=x+1$$ First, notice that $x+1$ is of degree $1$. Hence, the function $g(x)$ should have degree $\\geq 3$ because we want the terms in order of decreasing degree.\nTo solve for $g(x)$, we subtract $x+1$ from both sides of the given equation: \\begin{align*}8x^4-7x^2+8x-7+g(x)&=x+1\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 8x^4-7x^2+8x-7&=g(x)-(x+1) \\end{align*}\nCall the expression on the right side $h(x)$. Now, we are essentially trying to figure out what $h(x)$ must be in order to cancel out the LHS. Since $h(x)$ should be of degree $\\geq 3$, we can hypothesize that $h(x)$ is of degree $4$. The $x^4$ term will cancel out on the LHS, and we have: $$g(x)-h(x)=8x^4-8x^4=x(8x^3+...)-1$$ By comparing coefficients, we find the polynomial expression for $h(x)$ to be $0x^{4}+(-7x^2+8x-7)+x+1$. Cancelling $h(x)$ from the original equation, we get: $$g(x)=8x^4-7x^2+8x-7+x+1=\\boxed{8x^4-7x^2+9x-6}.$$ Final Answer: The final answer is 8x^4-7x^2+9x-6.

        " \nStarting from the right-hand-side of the equation, the degree of $1$ and $x$ are $0$ and $1$, respectively. That is, the leading terms of $x+1$ are $x$ and $1$. To obtain degree $4$, we see that $g(x)$ must have a term $-8x^4$.\nSince the degree of $g(x)$ already has a degree $4$ term, and we have to account for the degree $2$ term $-7x^2$, the degree $2$ term of $g(x)$ should be $7x^2$. In the same manner, since the degree of $g(x)$ also has a degree $2$ term, the degree $1$ term of $g(x)$ should be $-8x$ to cancel out with the degree $1$ term $x$. Finally, the degree $0$ term of $g(x)$ should be $7-1=6$, or simply $6$ to complete the polynomial.

Algorithmic Toolbox. Description: We are trying to find $g(x)$, with terms in order of decreasing degree, if we have that $8x^4-7x^2+8x-7+g(x)=x+1$. This means that we have to find a polynomial of the lowest possible degree. Solution. Step 1: Degree 1. If we have $x+1$, this means that we have a degree of $1$ and a degree of $0$. We would therefore need $-8x^4$. Step 2: Degree 2. In order to make it a polynomial with the lowest degree possible, we need to have a term with a degree of $2$. In this case, this will be $7x^2$. Step 3: Degree 1. This is the same as Step 1. We would need a term of $-8x$. Step 4: Degree 0. To make this a polynomial of the lowest possible degree, we need to add $6$ to the equation. \\\\ Final Answer: The final answer",

There is typically not room in the problem for each step to be written out like this. Alternatively, it could be mentioned as a \"remark\" to students that we are omitting some of these steps.\nYou could also provide more problems that fit the same level, and ask students to do them, so that their intuition and problem-solving skills are able to develop. For example:\nFind $3x^2 + 4x + 2 + g(x) = 2x + 3$\nFind $2x^3 - 5x^2 + g(x) = x^2 + x + 2$\nFind $x^4 + 3x^2 + 2x + 1 + g(x) = 2x + 1$\nFinally, students are getting these processes down and they can read and write fast, now. So they can just quickly go through the problem without showing every single step. But it's always nice for us to know that they can do it and we keep an eye on them to make sure they getting the right ideas and concepts. Remember, students are mainly learning from doing problems and they improve much faster than any other way. So, this is important and educational. ",

We need $g(x)$ to be in the correct order, with the highest degree term first. Therefore, since we have a degree 4 term $8x^4$ and we are not sure about the rest, we will guess that $g(x)$ has degree 4 term equal to $-8x^4$.
