        " Our system of equations has $5a=-4b+5$ and $3a=-2b+3$. In order to solve, we need to focus on one variable. Let\u2019s say, we want to find $b$. So we need to eliminate $a$ first by subtracting one equation from another: $5a - (3a) = (-4b+5) - (-2b+3) \\Rightarrow 2a = -2b +2 \\Rightarrow a = -b + 1$ Now, we substitute this value to one of the initial equations to solve for $b$. Let\u2019s use $5a=-4b+5$. $5(-b+1) = -4b+5 \\Rightarrow -5b +5= -4b+5$ Then we solve for $b$: $-5b +5= -4b+5$ $\\Rightarrow$ $5b=-0$ $\\Rightarrow$ $b=0$ Finally, we need to find $6b$.

Instead of calculating $5a$ immediately, we can multiply the second equation with $-2$ to cancel out $b$, then we can solve for $a$ in terms of $b$. We can then substitute this expression for $a$ in the first equation and solve for $b$. We finally get $b=0$. The answer $6b=0$ remains the same, but the improvement is in the step-by-step solution process.  #### More hints It would be good to organize the solution steps in the beginning, rather than starting the response without a clear plan. This way, the reader can follow the argument and be sure that we haven't missed any intermediate steps or done any algebraic trickery. Furthermore, you could provide more context about what the problem is about, and what the objective of the given equations is. Is this a homework problem? Are the students supposed to come up with the given equations, or do they know what they represent? etc.  This can help the reader better understand the problem and our solution.  A clean and organized solution can also make it easier to identify any potential mistakes. Another suggestion would be to provide an example or a picture for any of the steps that might be unclear to some readers. Finally, you could include the source of the problem, and any relevant information that could help students learn more about the topic. Sometimes, students might not understand the content of the problem, but they might still be",
