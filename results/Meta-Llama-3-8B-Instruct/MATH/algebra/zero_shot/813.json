The question tells us $\\displaystyle \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^x=\\frac{81}{256}$.

The denominator can be written as $4^4$. We do a simple mental calculation: \\begin{align*}\n\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^4 &= \\frac{3^4}{4^4} \\\\\n&= \\frac{81}{256}.\n\\end{align*} The last line is given to us.

        " $\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^x=\\frac{81}{256}$. Let\u2019s write a general equation: \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^x = y, \\frac{3^x}{4^x} = y. Now, to eliminate the exponent $x$, we divide both sides by $3^x$ and multiply by $4^x$:\n$\\displaystyle \\frac{\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^x}{3^x}=y\\left(\\frac{4^x}{3^x}\\right)$\n$\\displaystyle \\frac{1}{4^x}=y\\left(\\frac{4^x}{3^x}\\right)$\n$\\displaystyle \\frac{1}{4^x}=y\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^x$\nNow, we can simplify the fraction left-hand-side by a multiplication of both sides by $4^x$:\n$\\displaystyle 1=y\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^x$\nNow we can write another equation:\n$\\displaystyle \\frac{4}{3}=y$\nNow, we need to have $\\frac{4}{3}$ on both sides of the equation (one side is already set) to have an $x$ variable:\n$\\displaystyle \\frac{4}{3}\\frac{3^x}{3^x}=y$\n$\\displaystyle \\frac{4}{3}=y\\frac{3^x}{3^x}$\n$\\displaystyle \\frac{4}{3}=y\\left(\\frac{3}{3}\\right)^x$\n$\\displaystyle \\frac{4}{3}=y\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^x$\nNow, we want to take our original equation $\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^x=\\frac{81}{256}$ and write the following step:\n$\\displaystyle \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^x=y$\n$\\displaystyle \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^x=\\frac{4}{3}$ (since we just did the step \u201cAnother equation\u201d)\nNow, we can set both sides equal to take away the $x$: x = log_{\\frac{3}{4}}\\frac{4}{3} \\\\ $ `x = 2` \\\\\nFinal Answer: The final answer is x = 2.

        "\u00a0 Let $y = \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^x.$\nSince we know $y = \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^x = \\dfrac{81}{256}$, we can rewrite this as $(4/3)^x=\\frac{256}{81}$.\nThat is, $-\\dfrac{1}{\\log_{4/3}(\\frac{256}{81})}=x$.\nNow, $4/3=2^{2/3}$, and $\\frac{256}{81} = 2^{8/3}\\cdot 3^{-4/3} = 2^{-1/3}\\cdot(2^{8/3}\\cdot3^{-2/3})$, so $-\\frac{1}{\\log_{(2^{2/3})}\\left(2^{-1/3}\\cdot(2^{8/3}\\cdot3^{-2/3})\\right)}$= $x$.\n$$x=1$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 1. I hope it is correct.",
        " To start off, we could say that $\\displaystyle \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^x=\\frac{3^4}{4^4}=\\frac{81}{256}$. Now it is clear that $x = 2$ is a possible solution.\nBut there is something more !\n### Solution: Let us divide both sides by $\\displaystyle \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^x$.\nWe then have $1 = \\displaystyle \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^x$. So it is clear that $x = -2$ is also a possible solution. This is because $\\displaystyle \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^x=\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^{-x}$\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\displaystyle \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^{-x}\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^x=\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^x\\\\\n&\\Rightarrow\\qquad \\frac{1}{\\left(\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^x\\right)}=\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^x.\n\\end{align*}\nThus $x = -2$ is also a solution. Since we know that an equality remains an equality after multiplying or dividing both sides by any non-zero constant, we could also multiply by $4^x$ to get $\\displaystyle \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2=1$. After all that, I can see that $\\boxed{x=-2}$ and $\\boxed{x=2}$ are the only possible solutions.\nIn order to find the other 2 solutions, we have to be a bit cleverer. Firstly, let\u2019s multiply $\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^x$ by $\\frac{256}{81}$. Then we have $\\frac{3}{4}^x\\cdot\\frac{256}{81}=\\frac{4^4}{3^4}\\cdot\\frac{3^4}{4^4}=\\frac{256}{81}$ by doing so.\nAfter seeing this, it seems like $\\frac{3}{4}^x=\\frac{256}{81}$. Therefore $x=-4$ and $x=4$ are also correct solutions.\nSo finally there are 4 solutions $x = -4$, $x = -2$, $x =",

What about other values? Since $\\displaystyle \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^x$ equals $1$ when $x=0$, when $x$ is integer, $\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^x=1$, $\\displaystyle \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^{2x}=1$, $\\displaystyle 1^{x}=1$,$\\displaystyle x^{\\displaystyle x}=1$, so that the case $x=0$ is a factor.\n### Final Answer: x=0 .\nFinal Answer: The final answer is x=0. I hope it is correct. \n\nLet $n=\\log_2\\frac{81}{256}=-3$. By the periodic property of logarithm, $\\log_2 1 = 0$ and $\\log_2(-1)=1+kso$,the the answer is 0. \nFinal Answer: The final answer is x=0. I hope it is correct.",

        " First Step\nStep 1: Convert right side expression involving fractions and make sure we know when each fraction is positive/negative\nLet\u2019s think of the fractions on the right side. The calculation of $81/256$ seems to be positive.",
        " \nFirst we can rewrite the involvement by $\\displaystyle \\left(\\frac{4}{4}\\right)^x\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^x$. Then we can rewrite this into one exponent: $\\displaystyle \\left(\\frac{4}{4}\\right)^x \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^x=(\\frac{3}{4})^x$.\nNow we can take the logarithm of both sides: $\\log_2 \\left((\\frac{3}{4})^x \\right)=\\log_2 \\left(\\frac{81}{256} \\right)$.\nThe little 2 at the denominator will be written as the base for natural logarithm, and therefore the base will refer to the logarithmic function.\nWith base 2 logarithms, we would have: $\\log \\left((\\frac{3}{4})^x \\right)=\\log \\left(\\frac{81}{256} \\right)$.\nLet us find the actual value of that logarithmic:\nln(3/4)^x = ln(81/256),\nIt\u2019s probably difficult to calculate the complete log. . and we know that $\\displaystyle\\ln \\left(\\frac{a}{b} \\right)=\\ln a-\\ln b$.\nTaking this into consideration, we can write: $\\displaystyle\\ln \\left(\\frac{a}{b} \\right)=\\ln a-\\ln b$\n $\\ln\\left(\\left(\\dfrac{3}{4}\\right)^x\\right)$ = ln(3^x) - ln (4^x)\nNow, rewriting the variables as natural logarithms with base 2, we have:\n$\nln(3)^x - ln(2^2)^x = ln (3^x) - 2*ln(2)^x = ln (\\frac{81}{256})$\nNow we should calculate the value of ln(81) and ln(256), then subsites them into the equation. Therefore, we will continue by estimating the value of ln(81) as well as ln (256) using well-known logarithmic calculations.\nln(81) = 4*ln(3) would be the largest value since 3*3 = 9, then 3*3*3 = 27, that in turn adds 3 * 3 * 3 = 81.
