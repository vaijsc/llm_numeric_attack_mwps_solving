    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let $r$ be the number of rows, and $s$ be the number of seats per row. It follows that $rs = 450$ and $(r + 5)(s - 3) = 450$. Expanding the second equation, it follows that $rs - 3r + 5s - 15 = 450$, and substituting the value of $rs$, it follows that $3r - 5s + 15 = 0$. Substituting $s = \\frac{450}{r}$ into this new equation, we obtain that $$3r - 5 \\cdot \\frac{450}{r}+ 15 = 0 \\Longrightarrow r +5 -\\frac{750}{r} = 0.$$ Multiplying both sides of the equation by $r$ yields the quadratic equation $r^2 + 5r - 750 = 0$, which factors as $(r + 30)(r - 25) = 0$. Thus, $r = \\boxed{25}$.",

Each row has the same number of seats, and each seat is occupied. With $3$ fewer seats per row and $5$ extra rows, the same audience could still be seated, occupying all seats. How many rows does the auditorium have?\n### Solution:\nLet $r$ be the number of rows in the original auditorium. The total number of seats in the original auditorium is $r\\cdot(s-3)+5\\cdot s=450,$ where $s$ is the number of seats in each row. Similarly, the original auditorium has $r\\cdot s=445+5\\cdot3=458$ seats. Subtracting these two equations, we get $(s-3)r-5(s-3)=2,$ which determines $r$:\n$$r=\\frac{445}{2}+1=\\boxed{15}.$$Final Answer: The final answer is 15. I hope it is correct.",
        " Let $F$ be the number of seats in each row and $R$ be the number of rows of the auditorium. Then $F \\cdot R = 450$. If there are 3 fewer seats per row and 5 extra rows, then there are $F - 3$ seats per row and $R + 5$ rows. Therefore, we can write an algebraic equation for the new auditorium: $$(F - 3)(R + 5) = 450.$$We would like to solve for $R$. To simplify, we can use the distributive property of multiplication to obtain $$FR + 5F - 3R - 15 = 450.$$Then we can factor out $F$ and $R$ from the left side. \\begin{align*}\nFR + 5F - 3R - 15 &= 450\\\\\n\\Rightarrow (F - 3R) + 5F - 15 &= 450\\\\\n\\Rightarrow F(R - 3) + 5F &= 450 + 15\\\\\n\\Rightarrow F(R - 3 + 5) &= 465\\\\\n\\Rightarrow F(R + 2) &= 465\n\\end{align*}We are told that $FR = 450$, so $F(R + 2) = 465$ is equivalent to $F (R) = 450$. This means that the value of $F$ is really already given to us, because it is one of the values of $FR$. This is the exact pattern that we use in many different problems: since $FR$ is known, $F$ is also known. Therefore, our goal is to find the value of $R$. Rearranging the new equation, we obtain \u00a0$$R + 2 = \\frac{465}{F}.$$Now that we know we can divide by $F$, we still have to use the second equation $FR = 450$ to solve for $F$: $$\\frac{465}{F} = R + 2\\quad\\text{and}\\quad FR = 450.$$To do this, we can use the distributive property again to write $$FR = F(R) = 450.$$So we have \u00a0$$\\frac{465}{F} = R + 2\\quad\\text{and}\\quad F = \\frac{450}{R}.$$Combining the expressions for $F$, we have \\",
        " Since $r$ is the number of rows, each row will have $(r - 5)(r - 3)$ seats.  Since each of the $450$ seats is occupied, we have: $$(r-5)(r-3)=\\frac{450}{r}.$$ This will lead to $r^{2}-8r+15=\\frac{450}{r}$, or $r^{3}-8r^{2}+15r-450=0$. Now use a calculator to get an approximate solution for $r$, which is around 12. We know that $r$ must be an integer, so check values for $r=11,12,13,14...$ until the equation above becomes true. The correct answer is therefore $\\boxed{12}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{12}$. I hope it is correct.  Final Answer: The final answer is 12. I hope it is correct.

I hope it is correct. 450 people in the auditorium, three fewer seats per row, and five extra rows means the same audience could still be seated with 5 fewer seats in each row and 5 extra rows. So the new number of people would be 450. Let's break it down: 1. Subtract 5 seats from each row, so 450 divided by n seats per row minus 5, which is 450 / (n - 5). 2. In the new seating arrangement, add 5 rows. 450 / (n - 5) people divided by the same number of seats per row plus the extra 5, which is 450 / (n - 5) / (n - 5 + 5). 450 / (n - 5) / (n - 5 + 5) = 450 / n. 450 / n = the number of people that can occupy the new seating arrangement. Set the number of people equal to 450, the initial number of people. 450 / n = 450. Divide both sides by 450, so n = 18. The new seating arrangement has 18 rows. 18 rows after adding 5 more rows than the original, so the original number of rows is 18 - 5 = 13. So the initial number of rows in the auditorium is 18.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 18. I hope it is correct. 450 people  #### Final Answer: The final answer is 18. I hope it is correct. 450. #### Final Answer: The final answer is 18. I hope it is correct. What is the total number of seats in the newer arrangement of 5 more rows and 3 fewer seats per row? In other words,  5  extra rows and 3 fewer seats per row have the same total seats as the original $450 people$ seats. That means: The number of fewer seats per row, plus 5 times the number of seats per row will be equal",
        " To model this, we create equations in terms of variables:$$R\\cdot s = 450,\\\\(R-5)\\cdot(s-3)=450.$$ From the first equation, we can solve for $s=\\frac{450}{R}$. Substituting that into the second equation yields:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\left[R-5\\right]\\left[\\frac{450}{R}-3\\right]&=450,\\\\\n\\frac{450}{R}\\cdot R-450-3R+15&=450,\\\\\n-450-3R&=-450,\\\\\n3R&=0,\\\\\nR&=\\boxed{0\\ \\mathrm{or}\\ 150}\n\\end{align*}The integers only come from $R$. We have to accept that $R$ is an integer since we are referring to the number of rows, and the number of rows cannot be zero. Hence, the number of rows in the original auditorium is $\\boxed{150}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 150. I hope it is correct. 450/150=3. As each row has 3 seats less than the number of seats in the original auditorium and there are 5 extra rows, the total number of rows is 150. Final Answer: The final answer is 150.

I think subtracting will make it clear. $R \\cdot s = 450, \\\\ (R - 5) \\cdot (s - 3) = 450,\\\\ R \\cdot s - 5 \\cdot s - 3R + 15 = 450,\\\\ - 3 R - 5s + 15 = 450,\\\\ 3 R + 5 s = 465.\\, \\rightarrow\\, 3R+5s=465 -> R*s=450 -> 3R+5s-",
        " Let\u2019s think step by step. \nThe number of rows in the second situation, $R-5$, can be expressed as follows: $$\\frac{450}{(R-5)\\cdot(R-2)}=1.$$Here, $x$ (the number of rows in the first situation) has been replaced with $R$, and $x-5$ with $R-5$.\n### ",

        " So, there are $450$ people in total. There are $n$ rows and all the seats are occupied. Let $z$ be the number of seats in one row. Then $nz=450$.\n    - If there were $n-5$ rows and each row had $z+3$ seats, then $(n-5)(z+3)=450$.",
        " Let x denote the number of seats per row.\n###   Thus, with x seats per row, we would have nx people in the auditorium, with n indicating the number of rows.\n###   The problem tells us that the above equation amounts to 450, so we have the equation\n###   $$nx = 450.$$$Now we are also given that if we had x-3 seats per row and n+5 seats, the same audience could still be seated, occupying all seats. Hence, we have\n###   $$(x-3)(n+5) = 450.$$\n###   From the first equation, we get $n=\\frac{450}{x}$.  Plugging this into the second equation we get\n###   $$\\frac{450(x-3)}{x} + 5x = 450$$\n###   $$\\Rightarrow\\qquad 450(x-3) + 5x x^2 - 1350 + 5x = 0$$\n###   $$\\Rightarrow\\qquad x^2 - 1350 + 5x + 1350 - 450x = 0$$\n###   $$\\Rightarrow\\qquad x^2- 450x =0$$\n###   $$\\Rightarrow\\qquad x(x-450)=0$$\n###   so either $x=0$ or $x=450$. Clearly, we must have $x\\neq0$ and hence $x=450$.\n###   From the first equation, we also get $n=\\frac{450}{x}=1$. Hence, the number of rows in the auditorium is $\\boxed{1}$.

Each row contains the same number of seats and each seat in the auditorium is occupied. With three fewer seats per row, and five extra rows, the same audience could still be seated, occupying all seats. How many rows does the auditorium have?  /  1 ,   pd   1  /",
        " There are 3 fewer seats per row and 5 more rows in the alternative arrangement. Therefore, the number of rows in the original auditorium is $R$, and the number of seats per row is $r$. The number of seats that are in both arrangements are $Rr-3$, and the number of seats that are in the alternative arrangement only are $5r$. To account for all 450 people, we have that $Rr-3+5r=450$, which gives $Rr=453$. But $R$ must be an integer, and so $453=3\\cdot151$ can be broken up into $R=151$ and $r=3$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 151. I hope it is correct.

        " \nLet the total number of seats be $s$. \nBy the given information, we can set up an equation. The total number of seats with three fewer seats per row and 5 extra rows should be equal to $s$. It is\n$s - 3k + 5k = s.$\nSimplifying, we get $2k = 3.$\nSo, $k = 3/2 = 1.5.$\nSince there can\u2019t be a half row, let\u2019s assume there are 1 fewer row with 3 fewer seats per row. Thus, there are $k + 1$ rows originally.\nSo, $k + 1$ must be $450$. Solving the equation for $k$, we get  $\\boxed{449/2 = 224.5}.$\nSince it is impossible to have half a row, the auditorium has $\\boxed{224}$ rows. Final Answer: The final answer is 224. I hope it is correct.     Justification: Since there can\u2019t be a half row, it means that there are actually 224 rows. The number doesn\u2019t need to be even, so we don\u2019t need to worry about that.",

        " Each row contains $n$ seats, so $450$ people occupy $n$ seats in $r$ rows. That is, $n \\times r = 450.$ Now, if we subtract three fewer seats per row, we obtain $(n-3) \\times (r + 5) = 450$ or $n \\times r - 3r +5n-15=450.$ By comparing both expressions, we get $-3r +5n-15=0$ and $5n-3r=15.$ Since both expressions are equivalent, we can write them as  \\begin{align*} n&= \\frac{3r+15}{5},\\\\ r&= \\frac{5n-15}{3}. \\end{align*}\nIf we substitute the expression for $r$ in the expression for $n$, we get  \\begin{align*} n&= \\frac{3\\left(\\frac{5n-15}{3} \\right)+15}{5}\\\\ &= \\frac{5n-15+15}{5} \\\\ &= \\frac{5n}{5}\\\\ &= n. \\end{align*}\nTherefore, we can solve for $r$ by using the expression given for $n$:  \\begin{align*} r&= \\frac{5n-15}{3} \\\\ &= \\frac{5 \\left(\\frac{450}{r} \\right)-15}{3}\\\\ &= \\frac{2250-15r}{3r}\\\\ &= \\frac{2250}{3r}-\\frac{15r}{3r}\\\\ &= \\frac{750}{r}- 5\\\\ &= 750 - 5r. \\end{align*}\nSince $r$ must be a whole number and this expression gives us only integer solutions, we can get an expression $r=750 - 5r \\Rightarrow 6r=750 \\Rightarrow r= \\boxed{125}.$\n~ cindyli2uu\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 125.
