        " The two numbers are 18 and 7.\nHere is a solution in more detail:\nLet x be the larger number and y be the smaller number. Then, the sum of the two numbers is x + y = 25. The difference of the two numbers is x - y = 11.\nNow we can solve this system of equations.\nFrom the first equation, y = 25 - x.\nSubstitute this expression for y into the second equation:\nx - (25 - x) = 11.\nExpand and simplify:\nx - 25 + x = 11\n2x - 25 = 11\n2x = 36\nx = 18\nNow we know the larger number is 18. To find the smaller number, substitute x into the expression y = 25 - x:\ny = 25 - 18\ny = 7\nSo, the smaller number is 7.",
        " \nLet the smaller number be $x$. Then the other number is $x+11$. The sum of these two numbers is 25, so we get:\n$$x + (x+11) = 25$$\n$$2x + 11 = 25$$\nSubtract 11 from both sides:\n$$2x = 14$$\nDivide both sides by 2:\n$$x = 7$$\nSo the smaller number is 7. That\u2019s our answer. Always keep in mind the difference and the positive in a problem. It could be -2 or +2. Make sure to recognize it by following the problem. \nPlugin what we have in to the problem and we have 7 +11 = 18 and 7 - 11 = -4. The problem says their difference is 11. The problem says their sum is 25. But their difference is 11, which means the bigger number is 7 + 11 = 18 and the smaller number is 7. When you plug it in you have 18 - 7 = 11. It has to equal 11. If I had put the 7 as the bigger number we would have gotten a -4 difference instead of +11. That would be incorrect answer. \nThe key is to recognize that you are line to one of the two numbers and then use the other equation to determine what that number is, but also don\u2019t forget to recognize the difference and what it\u2019s related to in the problem.

        " \nLet the two numbers be a and b, with a \u2260 b. Then we know that a + b = 25 and |a - b| = 11. This means that either a - b = 11 or a - b = -11. If a - b = 11, then we know that a = b + 11, and substituting this into the first equation we get b + 11 + b = 25, so 2b = 14 and b = 7. a = 7 + 11 = 18. Therefore, the two numbers are 18 and 7, and the smaller number is 7. If a - b = -11, then a = b - 11, and substituting this into the first equation we get b - 11 + b = 25, so 2b = 36 and b = 18. a = 18 - 11 = 7.

This problem is an example of how solving a system of equations can often be used to solve problems that involve the relationship between two or more unknowns.\n### Additional guidance:\n* To solve this problem, we can use algebraic methods, such as solving a system of equations or using algebraic manipulations.\n* The main idea is to recognize that the sum and difference of the two numbers are related, and to use this relationship to find the values of the two numbers.\n* It\u2019s essential to pay attention to the units and the type of numbers involved in the problem to ensure that the solution makes sense. In this case, the sum and difference of the two numbers should be integers, and the numbers themselves should be positive integers.\n* It\u2019s also important to check the solution by plugging it back into the original equations to ensure that it satisfies the conditions. In this case, the solution x = 7 satisfies the equation x + (x + 11) = 25. \n#### Example 2:\nThe product of two numbers is 12, and their difference is 4. What are the two numbers? \nThis problem is similar to the previous one, except that we are now dealing with multiplication instead of addition, and subtraction instead of the difference.\nBy setting up an equation based on the product and difference of the two numbers, we can solve for the values of the two numbers.

        " **step-1**: First, we need to give both of these numbers values. For example, let's give the smaller of the two numbers a value of x. The other number would be x + 11 (since the difference is 11).\n**Step-2**: The sum of the two numbers is 25. That means we can add x and x + 11 together to get 25. We can set up an equation for this is x + x + 11 = 25. We can simplify that by combining like terms, which gives us 2x + 11 = 25.\n**Step-3**: Next, we need to get rid of the +11 on the left side of the equation by subtracting 11 from each side of the equation. This gives us 2x = 25 - 11. This simplifies to 2x = 14.\n**Step-4**: To get x by itself, we need to divide each side of the equation by 2. This gives us x = 14/2. The result is x = 7.\n**Step-5**: This means the smaller of the two numbers is 7, and the other number is 7 + 11, which is 18.

        " x and y are the two numbers. Since their sum is 25, we have the equation x + y = 25. So, y = 25 - x. Now, since their difference is 11, we have the equation x - y = 11. So, x - (25 - x) = 11. Can you solve for x?\nYes, I can! If we simplify this equation, we get:\n### x - 25 + x = 11\nCombine like terms:\n### 2x - 25 = 11\nAdd 25 to both sides:\n### 2x = 36\nDivide both sides by 2:\n### x = 18\nNow, we can find y by substituting x into y = 25 - x:\n### y = 25 - 18\n### y = 7\nSo, x = 18 and y = 7. Since we asked for the smaller of the two numbers, the answer is 7. Correct! The smaller number is 7. The other number is 18.

        " The difference between two numbers is 11, so the smaller number is 11 less than the bigger number. Let\u2019s call the bigger number N, so the smaller number is N-11. We know these two numbers have a sum of 25, so we can make an equation.\nN + N-11 = 25\nCombine like terms:\n2N-11 = 25\nAdd 11 to both sides:\n2N = 36\nDivide both sides by 2:\nN = 18\nSo the bigger number is 18, and the smaller number is N-11, which is 18-11, or 7. The smaller number is 7.\n### Why: We know that:\n- The difference between the two numbers is 11.\n- The sum of the two numbers is 25.\nLet's say the smaller number is x.\n- The bigger number will be x + 11, since it's 11 more than the smaller number.\nWe know the sum of the two numbers is 25, so we can set up the equation:\nx + (x + 11) = 25\nCombine like terms:\n2x + 11 = 25\nSubtract 11 from both sides:\n2x = 14\nDivide both sides by 2:\nx = 7\nSo the smaller number is 7, and the bigger number is 7 + 11, which is 18.\n### Implementation: Let's practice the problem using a simple implementation in Python.\n```\ndef smaller_larger_numbers(sum_difference, difference):\n    larger_number = difference + 11\n    smaller_number = sum_difference - larger_number\n    return {\n        'smaller_number': smaller_number,\n        'larger_number': larger_number\n    }\nprint(smaller_larger_numbers(25, 11))\n```\nIn this implementation, we define a function called `smarter_larger_numbers` that takes two arguments: `sum_difference` and `difference`. We calculate the larger number and the smaller number using the given information. Finally, we return a dictionary containing the smaller number and the larger number.\nWhen we run this code with the given values, we get:\n```\n{'smaller_number': 7, 'larger_number': 18}\n```\nThe smaller number is indeed 7, and the larger number is 18!",
