I am extremely sorry for that. The correct solution should be:\nGiven the equation $5x-9y=42$, we can rewrite it as $y = \\frac{5x - 42}{9}$, and since we know that the coordinates are additive inverses of each other, we can set up an equation as follows:\n\\begin{align*}\nx &= -y \\\\\n&= -\\frac{5x - 42}{9} \\\\\n&= -\\frac{5x}{9} + \\frac{42}{9} \\\\\n9x &= -5x + 42 \\\\\n14x &= 42 \\\\\nx &= 3.\n\\end{align*}Then, to find $y$, we substitute $x=3$ and we get:\n\\begin{align*}\ny &= -\\frac{5(3) - 42}{9} \\\\\n&= -\\frac{-6}{9} \\\\\n&= -\\frac{2}{3}.\n\\end{align*}So, the final answer is $\\boxed{(3, -\\frac{2}{3})}$.\nIt turns out I\u2019m having a bit trouble with some AoPS contest prose essays, ugh!

        " First, let\u2019s simplify our equation so that it\u2019s in y-intercept form.  We can do this by isolating $y$: \\begin{align*} 5x-9y&=42\\\\ 9y&=5x-42\\\\ y&=\\frac{5x}{9}-\\frac{42}{9}\\\\ &=\\frac{5}{9}x-\\frac{14}{3} \\end{align*}Let\u2019s think about what this is saying.  Let $y_add$ be the expression for $y$ above.  The key insight is that this is linear, and in particular $y_add(x_add)=-y_add$, for some value of $x_add$.\nThe point where we would like to find $y$ is the additive inverse of the current $x$, which we can also write as $-x$.  So if we plug in $-x$ for our $x$ in the above equation, we now know a point on the line where $y$ is additive inverse of $x$.
