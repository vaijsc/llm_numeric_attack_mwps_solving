From the next step we can define the intervals to explore by going through the graph:<br />\nBecause the graph of this parabola is facing downwards so there will be two possibilities: there could either be an y-intercept to the left or right of that vertex inspect the graph to find the vertices for the coordinates to determine:  or a vertex to be the left of  : To determine the interval will have the current parabola and the",
        " Final Answer: The solution is \\boxed{(-\\infty,-10)\\cup(-10,-3)}. I hope it is correct._Output\nIt is easy to find all $x$ that satisfy the inequality $(2x+10)(x+3)<(3x+9)(x+8)$.\n### Step 1: Simplifying the given inequality\n$(2x+10)(x+3)<(3x+9)(x+8)$\n$2x^2 +16x+30<3x^2+21x+72$\n$2x^2+16x+30-3x^2-21x-72 <0$\nRx^2-5x-42 <0",
        " Let\u2019s think step by step.\nI started by multiplying both sides by 1, which does not change the inequality\u2019s truth. Hence, the inequality becomes\n\\begin{align*}\n(2x+10)(x+3)&<(3x+9)(x+8) \\\\\n(2x^2+26x+30) & < (3x^2+21x+72)\n\\end{align*}\nThen, I factored the both sides: \\begin{align*}\n2x^2+26x+30 & < 3x^2+21x+72 \\\\\n2x^2+5x+18 & < 3x^2+9x+72\n\\end{align*}\nFurther, I have removed $2x^2$ and $3x^2$, hence it becomes \\begin{align*}\nx+18 & < x+72 \\\\\nx&< 72-18 \\\\\nx&< 54\n\\end{align*}\nSo, all $x$ that satisfy this inequality are $\\boxed{( -\\infty, 54)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is (-\\infty, 54). I hope it is correct.",
        " 2x+10 \\le 3x+9 and 2x+10 \\ge 3x+9 are not valid, so we select 2x+10<3x+9 [...](https://mathhelpforum.com/f2/inequality-2x10-case-3x9-140584/) 2x+10 \\le 3x+9 are not valid, so we select 2x+10<3x+9  Therefore, -10 \\le x Because 2x+10 \\ge 3x+9 are not valid, we need to choose 2x+10<3x+9. -10 \\le x But recall that we can always add a term as long as it has the same sign to both sides of the inequality. In this case, the term -10 must be added to both sides, and it would only have been added, if we had already determined that x was greater than or equal to -10.  Thus, we must have -10 \\ge x and it has been shown before that this inequality is satisfied.  Thus, our answer is [-10,\\infty).  It is not an interval, it is a set of all integers that are greater than or equal to -10, but there\u2019s a chance that the question could have been framed to ask for such a set, depending on whether -10 was allowed.  In this case, -10 would be allowed. Final Answer: The final answer is [-10,\\infty). I hope it is correct.  # Place for Comment  And congratulations for Michael for the correct solution about interval notation.
