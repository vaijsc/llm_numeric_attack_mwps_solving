    "solution": "Since $$j=\\frac{24}{k}=\\frac{48}{l}$$we have $l = 2k$. So $18\n= 2k^2$, which means that $9 = k^2$. Since $k$ has to be positive, this implies that $k = 3$. This means that $j = 8$, and $l = 6$. Hence $j+k+l = \\boxed{17}$.\n\nOR\n\nTake the product of the equations to get $jk\\cdot jl\n\\cdot kl = 24 \\cdot 48 \\cdot 18$. Thus $$(jkl)^2 = 20736.$$So $(jkl)^2 =\n(144)^2$, and we have $jkl = 144$. Therefore, $$j = \\frac{jkl}{kl} = \\frac{144}{18} = 8.$$From this it follows that $k=3$ and $l=6$, so the sum is $8+3+6=\\boxed{17}$.",

        " My solution\nWe have that $jk = 24$, so we know that $j$ divides 24. Similarly, since $jl = 48$, we know that $j$ divides 48, so $j$ is also divisible by 3. Since $kl = 18$ and $j$ divides 18, we know that $j$ divides 6. Therefore $j = 3$, since $j$ is the smallest positive integer that divides 24, 48, and 18. This gives us\n$$jk = 3\\cdot 8 = 24$$\n$$jl = 3\\cdot 16 = 48$$\n$$kl = 3\\cdot 6 = 18$$We also know that $k<24$ and $l<48$, which results in $k$ ranging from 1 to 23, and $l$ ranging from 1 to 47, respectively. Then $kl = 18$ has some integer solutions which are\n$$(k, l) \\in \\{(1, 18), (2, 9), (3, 6), (6, 3), (9, 2), (18, 1)\\}$$\nThe only solution for $k$ in this set is 6, since $k$ is the smallest positive integer in the solution which we found in the given equation. Similarly, $jl = 48$ has some integer solutions which are\n$$(j, l) \\in \\{(1, 48), (2, 24), (3, 16), (4, 12), (6, 8), (8, 6), (12, 4), (16, 3), (24, 2), (48, 1)\\}$$\nThe only solution for $l$ in this set is 16, since $l$ is the smallest positive integer in the solution which we found in the given equation. Therefore, we have $j = 3, k = 6,$ and $l = 16$, so $j + k + l = 3 + 6 + 16 = \\boxed{25}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 25. I hope it is correct.",
        " \n1. By the distributive property, $j(k+l)=jk+jl$. So, since $jk=24$ and $jl=48$, we have\n$$j(k+l)=24+48=72.$$\n2. We also have $k(l+j)=kl+jk$ by the distributive property, so $$k(l+j)=18+24=42.$$\n3. Using the additional fact that $kl=18$, we can see that\n$$(k+j)l=k(jl)+(kl)=42+18=60.$$\n4. Therefore, $k+j=60/l$, so\n$$k+j+l=60/l+l=60/l+(l/l+lk/l)=60/l+lj/l=60/l+48/l=72/l.$$ So,\n$$j+k+l=\\boxed{72}.$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 72. I hope it is correct.  That\u2019s it for now!

        " \nNote that since $j$ and $k$ are of opposite sign and their product is $24$, one must be even and the other odd.  We are given that $jk=24$, so both $j$ and $k$ are factors of $24$.  Similarly, both $j$ and $l$ are factors of $48$, and both $k$ and $l$ are factors of $18$.  Now, $24$ is the product of three factors: $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $6$, $8$, $12$, or $24$.  If $j$ and $k$ are both of these factors, they can take $12$ distinct values, because $j+k$ must be odd.
