I hope it is correct.  ### Verification:  To verify that this is the correct answer, let\u2019s see what happens when we plug it into the system of equations.  If we plug $a=20$ into the system, we get  \\begin{align*} 2x+5y&=-8,\\\\ 6x&=16+20-15y.  \\end{align*}We can eliminate $x$ algebraically, obtaining  $$y=\\frac{2}{5}x-4.$$This gives us one solution.  But now we can plug in any value of $y$ into this equation and calculate a corresponding value of $x$, so there are infinitely many solutions.\nFor example, plugging in $y=0$, we get $x=-4$, which gives the point $(x, y)=(-4, 0)$.  Plugging in $y=1$, we get $x=-3$, which gives the point $(x, y)=(-3, 1)$.  And so on.  Therefore, our answer of $a=20$ is correct.  These answers can be verified by plugging these values into the original system.  ### Related Posts\n```\n```\nSolution 2:\nLet us solve the given system of linear equations by elimination method.\nThe given equations are",

        " The thing you do first when you are given a system of equations is to write the second equation in the form $ax+by=c$, where $a$, $b$, $c$ are constants.  We know that we have: $6x = 16 + a - 15y$.  If we multiply both sides by $\\frac{1}{6}$ we get: $x = \\frac{8+a}{6} - \\frac{5}{2}y$.  A standard problem in linear algebra is adding a multiple of one equation to another, so we can add $-15$ times the first equation to the second equation, which will eliminate the $y$ term in the second equation.  The $y$ term in the first equation is $5y$, so subtracting $-15$ times as much as possible will make the $y$ term in the new equation $0$. $6x = \\frac{8+a}{6} - \\frac{5}{2}y$ Subtract $-15 \\times 5y = -75y$ to eliminate the $y$ term: $6x - 75y = \\frac{8+a}{6} - 75y - \\frac{5}{2}y = \\frac{8+a}{6}$ Now we have a system that looks somewhat simpler.  We have two equations in terms of $x$, $y$: \\begin{align*} 2x + 5y &= -8,\\\\ 6x - 75y &= \\frac{8+a}{6} \\end{align*} That\u2019s all for now.

The first equation yields $y = (-8-2x)/5.$ Plugging this into the second equation we obtain $6x = 16 + a - 15(-8 - 2x)/5.$ Solving for $x$ yields $x = 8/(2-a).$ If this $x$ satisfies the first equation, then $y = (-8-2x)/5 = -4/(2-a).$ This $y$ also satisfies the first equation. So, the final solution is $(x,y) = ((8/(2-a),(-4)/(2-a)). We want this to be the only solution of the system. Then, the unique solution of this system is the solution to the first equation, i.e., $x = -4$ and $y = -2.$ Therefore, we want $(8/(2-a),(-4)/(2-a)) = (-4,-2)$ or $(8/(2-a) = -4 and (-4)/(2-a) = -2.$ Solving these equations for $a$ give us $a=\\boxed{6}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 6.

If the response is not correct or if there is any issue, please let me know and I will make sure to address it.  If anyone else has a different solution or if they see any mistake, I will appreciate any input that could help improve my understanding of the concept. Thank you!  \\begin{align*}\n 2x + 5y &= -8,\\\\\n 6x &= 16 + a - 15y\n\\end{align*}\nFor infinitely many solutions, these lines are identical!  The slopes are the same.  The slope of the first line is 2/5 and the slope of the second line is 6/15, which is the same.  Now, if we solve for $y$, we obtain\n\\begin{align*}\n y &= \\frac{-2}{5}x-8/5\\\\\n y &= \\frac{2}{15}x - \\frac{16+a}{15},\n\\end{align*}which we can rewrite as $y",
        " The first thing we can do is to put both equations in the form $\\, x + cy = d\\,,$ so that we can immediately recognize whether or not the system has an infinite number of solutions.\nI will put the first equation into the asked form, i.e.\n$$x+cy=d\\Rightarrow2x+5y=-8,$$$$d=-8,\\,c=5.$$Now, I will put the second equation into the asked form, i.e.\n$$x+cy=d\\Rightarrow6x=16+a-15y,$$$$d=16+a,\\,c=-15.$$\n### Now, comparing the coefficients of the $y$ terms in both equations, I will compare $\\boxed{c=-15}.$ and $\\boxed{c=5}.$  To the solution, our value of $a$ should be:\n$$\\boxed{a=11}.$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 11.

        " There are many ways to approach this problem. Here are two possible methods.\n#### Method 1: By Elimination\nThe idea is to take the first equation and multiply it by 3 to make the coefficient of $x$ in the second equation equal to the coefficient of $x$ in the first equation, and then subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate the $x$ variable.  We can check that this happens if we multiply the first equation by 3: $$3(2x + 5y) = 6x + 15y = -24.$$ Then, if we subtract the first equation by the second, the $x$\u2019s will cancel out: $$(6x + 15y) - (2x + 5y) = 4x = -8$$If we now add these two equations together, we can eliminate the $x$ variable and get the equation $$10y = -8 + 16 + a$$\nA quick calculation shows that $a = \\boxed{-8}$ and for this value of $a$, the system of equations has infinitely many solutions. This is because the system of equations simplifies to $2x+5y=-8$ and $4y=0$, which is a consistent system of equations having infinitely many solutions.\n#### Method 2: By Row Reduction\nAnother way to approach this problem is by taking the matrix equation $$\\begin{bmatrix}2&5\\\\ 6&-15\\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix}x\\\\ y\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}-8\\\\ 16+a\\end{bmatrix}$$\nWe can row reduce this matrix to obtain the following augmented matrix: $$\\begin{bmatrix}1&\\frac{5}{2}\\\\ 0&1\\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix}.\\ .\\ . \\end{bmatrix}$$\nand then we can add 2.5 times the first row to the second row to get $$\\begin{bmatrix}1&\\frac{5}{2}\\\\ 0&0\\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix}.\\ .\\ . \\end{bmatrix}$$ This means that for this value of $a$, the column is linearly dependent and the system of equations has infinitely many solutions. This value of $a$ is $\\boxed{-8}$, which is the same value that we obtained from the",
        "From the second equation we obtain\n$$y=\\frac{16+a-x}{15}.$$Let\u2019s substitute this into the first equation:\n\\begin{align*}\n2x+5\\left(\\frac{16+a-x}{15}\\right)&=-8\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 2x+\\frac{80+a-5x}{3}&=-8\\\\\n3(2x)+80+a-5x&=-24\\\\\n6x+a&=-104\\\\\na&=-104+6x\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad y&=\\frac{-104+6x+a-x}{15}=\\frac{6x-a-104}{15}\n\\end{align*}Let\u2019s thus solve when do systems of equations has infinitely many solutions.When a system has infinitely many solutions it will mean that we have the same equation $x=b,$ where $b$ is some number. That\u2019s when $6x+a-104=15y$ and $2x+5y=-8$.This gives $2x+5y=-8 \\Leftrightarrow y=-\\frac{2x+8}{5}$, and thus $6x+a-104=15\\left(-\\frac{2x+8}{5}\\right) = -3x-24-a$.Let\u2019s solve for $x$.An $x$ value for which we have infinitely many solutions should also satisfy both equations. This way we should have $6x+a-104=-3x-24-a$, or $9x=80$.  This implies that $x=8\\frac{2}{3}.$ Thus we have the same value of $x$, so we find the value for $a$ as follows.\n\\begin{align*}\na+6x-104&=-3x-24-a\\\\\na+6\\left(\\frac{26}{3}\\right)-104&=-3\\left(\\frac{26}{3}\\right)-24-a\\\\\na+52-\\frac{104}{3}&=-26-8-a\\\\\n3a+52-104&=-26-8\\\\\n3a&=-52-8=-60\n\\end{align*}We thus find that the solution of infinitely many solutions is $a=\\boxed{-20}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -20. I hope it is correct.  \\begin{align*} 2x + 5y &= -"
