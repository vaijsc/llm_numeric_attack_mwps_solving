Comparing exponents, it follows that we have the system of equations \\begin{align*}\nx+y &= 4 \\\\\nx -y &= 1/4.\n\\end{align*} Summing the two equations yields that $2x = 4+1/4 = 17/4$, so $x = 17/8$.

        "\u00a0$$x y = 1/2$$ Click to show a solution. For the moment, ignore the first equation. We can then infer that $81^{x - y} = 3$, so this implies that $3^{2(x - y)} = 3$, and since $3^0 = 1$ and $3^1 = 3$, we must then have that $2(x - y) = 1$, so $x - y = 1/2$. We can rewrite the first equation as $3^{2x + 2y} = 3^4$, and noting that the bases are equal, $2x + 2y = 4$, so $x + y = 2$. Adding this to the equality $x - y = 1/2$ then gives us that $x + x = 2 + 1/2 = 2.5$, and this implies that $x = 2.5/2 = 5/4$, and $y = 2.5/4 = 5/8$.

        " First, $81 = 3^4$, and so we can write $$3^{x + y} = (3^4)^{(x - y)/4}.$$ Thus, the exponent $x + y$ of the left-hand side is an integer multiple of $4$. Let\u2019s write $x + y = 4k$ for some positive integer $k$. Then we have $$81^{x - y} = 3 = (3^4)^{\\frac{x - y}{4}} = (3^{x + y})^{\\frac{k - \\frac{1}{2}}{k}}.$$ Thus, $$\\left(3^{x + y}\\right)^{k + \\frac{1}{2}} = 3.$$Therefore, $\\left(3^{x + y}\\right)^k = 1$. Because $x + y$ is necessarily an integer multiple of $4$, so is $k$. That is, $$x + y = 4k$$ for some positive integer $k$.  Then, the left-hand side of the first equation $3^{x + y}$ is a perfect fourth power, so the exponent of the left-hand side is four times a positive integer $k$, namely $4k$. Now, we can deduce that $$x - y = \\frac{k}{4}$$ from the second equation. Solving for $x$ and $y$, we have $$x = \\frac{5k}{4}$$ and $$y = \\frac{3k}{4}.$$  We can substitute this into the given equations, that is, \\begin{align*} &3^{5k/4 + 3k/4} = 3^4,\\\\ &3^{(5k/4 - 3k/4)}= 3. \\end{align*} It follows that $k = 2$.  Therefore, the solution is $$xy = \\frac{3k}{4}\\cdot \\frac{5k}{4} = \\frac{15k^2}{16} = \\boxed{\\frac{15}{16}}.$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\frac{15}{16}.

        " First, we convert $3^{x + y} = 81$ into the following equalities:\n\\begin{align*}\n3^{x+y} &=81\\\\\n&=3^4\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\quad x+y &=4.\n\\end{align*} \\begin{align*}\n3^{x-y} &=1\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\quad 3^{x-y} &=3^0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\quad x-y &=0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\quad x&=y.\n\\end{align*}Using the information above, we have that \\begin{align*}\nx&=y=2\\\\\nxy&=\\boxed{\\frac{4}{1} = 4}.\n\\end{align*}\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 4.

        " Let\u2019s think step by step.\n$3^{x+y}=81$, so $x+y=\\log_{3}81 = 4$, taking log on both sides.\n$81^{x-y}=3$, so $x-y=\\log_{81}3=\\frac{1}{4}$. We can add $x+y=4$ and $x-y=\\frac{1}{4}$ to get \\begin{align*}\nx &= \\frac{4+\\frac{1}{4}}{2}=2, \\text{ and}\\\\\ny &= 4-2=2, \\text{ }\\\\\nxy&=2\\cdot2=\\boxed{\\frac{4}{1}=4}.\n\\end{align*}\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\frac{4}{1}.
