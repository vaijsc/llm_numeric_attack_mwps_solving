        " First, the function $f(x) = 3x - 4$ describes how the function takes the variable $x$ and multiplies it by 3, and then subtracts 4.\nThen it asks what the value of $g(0)$ is. It asks $g(0)$ because it is using $0$ as the input for the function $g(x)$. Here is how $0$ would be fed into the function $g(x)$:$g(x)=3x-4$ Now, we replace $x$ with $0$, to find the value of $g(0)$: $g(0)=3(0)-4$ Now, we need to calculate the expression inside the parentheses first:\n$(3)(0) = 0$, so, $g(0) = 0 - 4$\nNow we subtract $4$ from $0$:\n$g(0) = 0 - 4$\nFurther, $-4$.

        " $g(0)$\nSince $g(x) = 3x - 4$, we plug in $x=0$ into the function to get $g(0) = 3(0) - 4 = \\boxed{-4}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -4. I hope it is correct.### Claim: Indeed, the function $g$ has a domain consisting of all real numbers.\nI think the claim is incorrect.  There is a hole at $x=4/(3hash), so this value is not in the domain of $g$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is FALSE. I hope it is correct.### Step 1: We have a function $g(x) = \\frac{x}{x - 1}$.  This function cannot have a hole because: \nWe can write the function as $g(x) = \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{1}{x}}$.  This fraction cannot have a value of $0$ because there is no $x$-value that would make the denominator equal to $0$, and all fractions with a non-zero denominator are defined at all real number values for the numerator.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is FALSE. I hope it is correct.### Claim: The function $g(x) = |x|$ is one-to-one.\nI think the claim is false.  Since $g(-1)=1=g(1)$, the function is not one-to-one.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is FALSE. I hope it is correct.### Claim: Every function whose domain is all real numbers and whose range is all real numbers is a surjective function.\nI think the claim is true.  For example, the identity function $f(x)=x$ is surjective, and given any real number $y$, there exists a real number $x=y$ such that $f(x)=y$.  Similarly, any other function of the form $g(x)=ax+b$ is surjective.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is TRUE. I hope it is correct.### Claim: Every function whose domain is all real numbers and whose range is all real numbers is an injective function.\nI think the claim is false.  For example, the function $g(x)=x^2$ is not injective, because given any real number $y$, there can be multiple values of $x$ such that $g(x)=y$.  Namely, $x=\\",

However, I'm not sure whether this is a good way to answer an instructor\u2019s question. Sometimes the instructor wants you to plug the value of $x$ into the function and simplify. At other times, the instructor is looking for a specific pattern that you are supposed to recognize. Here are some guidelines for the latter case. Define $f$ as the successor function, which is such that $f(n) = n + 1$ for all $n$. Then $f$ is not like a standard mathematical function. For instance, you don\u2019t have to evaluate $f(1)$ as $(1 + 1)$.\nIf a function $f$ is defined using a piecewise definition, such as $f(x) = x^2$ if $x \\ge 2$ but $f(x) = 0$ otherwise, then you have to evaluate $f(-1)$ by considering the function\u2019s value when $x = -1$. For instance, you would say $f(-1) = 0$.\nAt yet other times, the instructor is looking for you to recognize a pattern. Here are some signs that this is what the instructor wants: the quote or sentence in the question talks about a pattern or rule. A problem that captures this is a turning back to the question about the function $f(n) = n + 1$. A pattern in this question is the structure of the mathematical statement. Generally, a pattern is an underlying principle or a consequence of the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Patterns can be found in many different areas of mathematics. You can find patterns in ratios of numbers in fractions, patterns in arithmetic operations in algebra, or patterns in geometric shapes in geometry. In the case that you are trying to find a pattern, ask your instructor if that is what they are looking for, or if you can determine from the context of the problem.",
