        " We know the point (2,-3) lies on the line and the line has slope 1/2.

        " \nWe can write an equation for this line as $y-(-3)=\\frac{1}{2}(x-2),$ or $y+\\frac{1}{2}x=\\frac{1}{2}(2)-3=-\\frac{4}{2}=-2.$ We can simplify this equation to $y=-\\frac{1}{2}x-2.$ This line passes through the point $(2,-3)$, so we can plug in \\begin{align*}\n2 &\\mapsto x\\qquad\\qquad -3\\mapsto y\\\\\n-\\frac{1}{2}(2)-2 &=-3\\\\\n-4&=-3\n\\end{align*}which confirms that the equation is indeed true for this point. Therefore, the $y$-intercept of this line is defined by where this line crosses the $y$-axis.

        " \nFor a line with slope $\\frac12$, the rate of increase is one-half of the rate of increase in the $x$-direction. Therefore, the distance traveled vertically is always one-half of the distance traveled horizontally. So, the equation of the line can be written as $y=-\\frac32+\\frac12 x$.\nFor this line, we can find the $y$-intercept by setting $x=0$ and solving for $y$: $y=-\\frac32+\\frac12 \\cdot 0=-\\frac32$. Therefore, the $y$-coordinate of the $y$-intercept is $\\boxed{-\\frac32}$.\\\\",

We also know the $y$-coordinate of the point is -3, so set $y=\\frac12\\cdot2 - 3=-3$: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac12\\cdot2 - 3 &= -3 \\\\\n2 - 3 \\cdot 2 &= 0 \\\\\n-4 &= 0 \\\\\n\\end{align*} We have a contradiction, which means that this value for $b$ is not correct.\nLet\u2019s try to find the correct value for $b$.
