        " $xy$\nStep 1:\u00a0 Solve $2x - 9y = 14$: Subtract $2x$ from both sides to get $-9y = -2x+14$. Divide both sides by $-9$ and subtract $14$ to get $y=\\frac{2x-14}{9}$. We also know that $$6x=42+y\\Rightarrow y=6x-42.$$ Plugging this into the equation $y=\\frac{2x-14}{9}$ we get $$6x-42=\\frac{2x-14}{9}\\Rightarrow 6x-42=\\frac{2x}{9}-\\frac{14}{9}\\Rightarrow \\frac{54x}{9}-42=\\frac{2x}{9}-\\frac{14}{9}\\Rightarrow 42=\\frac{50x}{9}-\\frac{14}{9}\\Rightarrow \\frac{(50x-42)9}{9}=42\\Rightarrow 50x-42=42\\Rightarrow 50x=84\\Rightarrow x=\\frac{84}{50}=1.68.$$ Let\u2019s take the positive root of x as x=1.68. Now let\u2019s plug this value into the expression y=6x-42 to get y=6(1.68)-42=y=-18.0. Now let\u2019s multiply x and y to get xy=1.68(-18.0)=-30.24. We can round the answer to 30.

        " We are given the two equations $2x-9y=14$ and $6x=y+42$, and we need to find the product of the two variables, $xy$. ### 1. We will solve the second equation for $y$ to get $y=6x-42$. Substitute this value for $y$ into the first equation to get$$2x-9(6x-42)=14$$### To expand and simplify, distribute $9$ to each term inside the parentheses, getting$$2x-54x+378=14$$### Combine the terms with the $x$\u2019s on the left-hand side and factored out $x$ from the $-54x$ to get $-52x+378=14$. Subtract $14$ from each side of the equation to get $-52x+364=0$. Finally, add $364$ to each side of the equation to isolate the $x$, giving $-52x=364$. Divide each side by $-52$ to get $x=\\frac{364}{-52}$. This simplifies to $x=-\\frac{7}{1}$, or just $x=-7$. Now that we have found $x$, we can substitute this value for $x$ back into either of the original equations to get a value for $y$. Substituting $x=-7$ into the second equation yields $-42+y=42$, so $y=84$. To get the product of $xy$, multiply $x$ and $y$ together to get $$x\\cdot y=(-7)(84)=-588.$$### Final Answer: Therfore, the correct answer is -588. I hope it is correct.antarayravi@gmail.com I am very grateful to you. This free math help is a lifesaver. \u2013Ravi M. K. Vyas (My student)\nI came to my senses, Arav, and then I solved the problem. I found it nice to see step by step solution when I first learned it. So here it is:\nIf $2x-9y=14$ and $6x=42+y$, what is the value of the product $xy$?",
        " \nWe notice that $y$ appears as a term in the first equation, but not in the second. This leads us to isolate $y$ first. If we multiply the second equation by $-1$, then $-6x=-42-y$, and this gives us $y=42+6x$.  Now we can substitute this into the first equation. Substituting and solving for $x$, we find $2x-9(42+6x)=14$. Distributing terms, we have $2x-378-54x=14$, which is equivalent to $-52x=-364$, so $x=\\frac{-364}{-52}=7$. Now we know that $x=7$ and $y=42+6x=42+42=84$. Therefore the desired value is $\\boxed{xy = 7\\times 84 = 588}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 588. I hope it is correct.",
        " Step 1: From $2x-9y=14$, we can get the value of $y$\nFirst, we can rewrite the equation:\n\\begin{align*}\n&2x - 9y = 14\\\\\n&\\Leftrightarrow y=\\frac{2x-14}{9}\n\\end{align*}\n### "
