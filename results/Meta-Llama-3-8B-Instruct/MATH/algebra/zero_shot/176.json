Since $625 = 5^4$ and $4$ is one less than $b$.\n### Note:\nNote that if we were trying to simplify $625^{(b-1)}$ by getting rid of the exponent, we would have something like $625^{(b-4)}$. This wouldn\u2019t work because $b-1$ is already the exponent. That idea doesn\u2019t work.

HOW CAN I EXPLAIN THIS LIKE MY TEACHER EXPECTED. PLEASE SHARE SOME TIPS FOR EXPLAINING THE LONG ANSWER. Hey, don't worry!  I'm here to help. Here are some suggestions on how to explain the long answer:\n Tip 1: Understand the question: Try to comprehend the question completely and step by step. Break it down into simpler parts and think about what's being asked. In this case, we're asked to find the value of $b$ in $5^b + 5^b + 5^b + 5^b + 5^b = 625^{(b-1)}$. So, we need to understand what $625^{(b-1)}$ means and how it's related to $5^b$. So take a moment to think about it, and make sure you grasp what the question is asking.\n Tip 2: Start with what you know: Write down what you know from the equation, like $5^b + 5^b + 5^b + 5^b + 5^b$.\n Tip 3: Transform the equation: Now, you could rewrite this as $(5^1)^b + (5^1)^b + (5^1)^b + (5^1)^b + (5^1)^b$, and it can be rewritten further as $5^1\\cdot5^b + 5^1\\cdot5^b + 5^1\\cdot5^b + 5^1\\cdot5^b + 5^1\\cdot5^b$. Then simplify it to $(5^1)(5^b+5^b+5^b+5^b+5^b)$, and this becomes $(5^1)(5\\cdot5^b)$.",
        " I have an answer, but I'm not sure it's correct. $5^b$ is equal to one term in the expression $5^b + 5^b + 5^b + 5^b + 5^b$ , which is repeated 5 times. This means that we have $$5^b + 5^b + 5^b + 5^b + 5^b = 5(5^b) = 5^{b+1}.$$Therefore, we have $$5^{b+1} = 625^{(b-1)}.$$Now, I know that 625 is equal to 5^4 . Therefore, the above equation can be written as $5^{b+1} = (5^4)^{(b-1)}.$To get rid of the exponents, we can take the log base 5 of each side, which gives $\\log_5 (5^{b+1}) = \\log_5 ((5^4)^{(b-1)})$.By applying the rules of logarithms, $$b+1 = (b-1)\\log_5(5^4).$$Since $5^4 = 625$, we know $\\log_5 (5^4) = 4.$  So we can substitute this in to get:$$b+1 = (b-1)(4).$$So $b = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{5}}$.\nBest regards, Nick.

This means that $5^b=625^{b-1}$. Taking the $\\ln$ of both sides, gives $$\\ln 5^b=\\ln 625^{b-1}$$ Then, we can rewrite the left side of the equation as $b\\ln5$, and the right side as $(b-1)\\ln625$. \nTherefore, we can write: $$b\\ln5=(b-1)\\ln625$$ \nWe can now divide both sides by $\\ln5$ to get $b=\\frac{\\ln 625}{\\ln5}$, which can be written as $\\boxed{\\frac{\\ln 625}{\\ln 5}}$. \nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\frac{\\ln 625}{\\ln 5}.

This means that the exponent $4b-4$ is the same as $b$, which means that we can set $b-4=1$, and since we are working with whole numbers, we can add 4 to both sides to find that $b=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{4}}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\frac{5}{4}. I hope it is correct. \n",
        " We are given: $\\boxed{5^b+5^b+5^b+5^b+5^b=625^{(b-1)}.}$ First, we factor out $5^b$ from the left-hand side to get: $$5^b\\cdot 5^b=625^{(b-1)},$$then we divide both sides of the equation by $5^b$ to get $$5^b=625^{(b-1)}\\div 5^b=\\left(5^2\\right)^{(b-1)}\\div5^b=5^{2(b-1)-b}=5^{b-1}.$$ Thus, $b=1$, so we have $\\boxed{b=1}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 1.
