        " \nTo solve this inequality, we can first isolate $r$ by combining the like terms on the left-hand side. This gives us$$(-13)(r+5) + 25 > 4(r-10).$$Expanding the left-hand side gives us$$-13r-65+25 > 4r-40,$$which can be simplified as$$-13r-40>4r-40.$$\nNow, we can add $40$ to both sides to obtain$$-13r>4r,$$and then subtract $4r$ from both sides to get$$-17r>0.$$Dividing both sides by $-17$ gives us$$r<-0.$$Since $r$ is less than $0$, we can rewrite this as $r \\in \\boxed{(-\\infty,0)}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is (-\\infty,0).

We can substitute like shown for the subtraction $-13(r + 5) + 25$ to get $-13r - 65 + 25 > 4r - 40$. We can manipulate the inequality by moving the constants until there is only one term with the variable. \nThe inequality is $-40 - 4r > -13r - 40$, which we can rewrite as $9r > -40 + 40$. Since $40 - 40 = 0$, this can be simplified to $9r > 0$. Since $0 < 9r$, we can divide both sides of the inequality by $9$ (which is a positive number) and the inequality remains valid. Therefore, $\\frac{9r}{9",

The final solution set is ( - \\infty, \\frac{76}{9} ] .  We check $r = -5$. $$-13(-5+5)+25 = 25$$ and $$4(-5-10) = -60.$$ The left side is bigger than the right side, so r = -5 is in the solution set, and we again add a parentheses to the solution set: ( - \\infty, \\frac{76}{9} ] .
