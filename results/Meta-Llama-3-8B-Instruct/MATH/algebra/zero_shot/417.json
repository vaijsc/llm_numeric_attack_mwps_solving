This is the same as expressing $y$ as a function of $x$.\nThe second equation is already expressed solely in terms of $x$ and $y$.\nSince we have a value for $y$, we can substitute it back into the second equation. After doing so, we get $K(\\frac{7}{4}-\\frac{4}{4}y)+8y=7$.

        " First idea:\nWe add the equations together.\nThus, $(6 + K)x + 12y = 14$.\n### Second idea:\n Notice that the equation $12y = 14 \u2013 (6 + K)x$ has two integer solutions.    We know that this cannot happen if $12$ and $6 + K$ were relatively prime, because then $12$ and $6+K$ have no common factors to cancel.  Therefore, we must have a common factor.  In fact, $12$ must be the largest factor of $12$ and $6+K$.\n### Conclusion:\n Since $12$ is the largest factor, we know that $6 + K$ has at least a factor of $4$.  Thus, $K = -2$, because the only option with this property is $K = -2$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -2. I hope it is correct.  Also, the equation system is equivalent to $x+2y = 1$ and $Kx+4y=1$ as $$6x+4y=7$$ is the same as $$x+2y=1$$ and $$Kx+8y=7$$ is the same as $$Kx+4y=1$$.\nHope it will be clear now.  Let me know if you have any further questions.  Thank you.  If we are faced with the system of equations $$6x + 4y = 7$$ $$Kx + 8y = 7$$ we must find the value of K.  In the following, we write the equations in the form $$(6 + K)x + 12y = 14.$$  If we consider (x,y) are any real numbers and write y in term of x using $6x+4y=7$ then: $$y=\\frac{7-6x}{4}.$$  This is used as follows: $$Kx+8y=7$$ $$Kx+8\\left(\\frac{7-6x}{4}\\right)=7$$ which simplifies to: $$Kx+7(1-x)-6x=7$$ Which gives $$(K-7)x+7=7.$$ This is a simple equation that holds as long as $K-7=0$ and $7=7$.  However, if $x$ is not fixed, $Kx+8y=7$ also satisfies",
        " \nTo try to find a solution for $(x,y)$, we could start by solving the first equation for $x$. It gives us $x = \\frac{7-4y}{6}$.\nWe can then substitute this expression for $x$ in the second equation. It yields \\begin{align*}\nK\\left(\\frac{7-4y}{6}\\right)+8y&=7 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad6K(7-4y)+48y&=42 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad 6K-24Ky+48y&=42 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad -24Ky+48y&=42-6K \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad y(48-24K)&=42-6K \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad y&=\\frac{42-6K}{48-24K}\n\\end{align*}\nIf we substitute $y$ back into the equation for $x$, we get $x = \\frac{7-4(\\frac{42-6K}{48-24K})}{6} = \\frac{7(48-24K)-(42-6K)(4)}{6(48-24K)}$.\nSo, a pair $(x,y)$ can only exist if this last expression is equal to the expression for $x$ from the first equation. We have to set these two expressions equal and solve for $K$: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{7(48-24K)-(42-6K)(4)}{6(48-24K)} &= \\frac{7-4y}{6} = 1 \\\\\n&\\Rightarrow \\qquad 7(48-24K)-(42-6K)(4) = 6 \\cdot 7 -6 \\cdot 4 \\\\\n&\\Rightarrow \\qquad 336-168K=42-24K \\\\\n&\\Rightarrow \\qquad 168K-24K=336-42=294 \\\\\n&\\Rightarrow \\qquad 144K=294 \\\\\n&\\Rightarrow \\qquad \\boxed{K=7/2}.\n\\end{align*}\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 7/2.

        " We have a system of two linear equations. Let us first write them:\n$$6x + 4y = 7 \\hspace{2cm} (1)$$\n$$Kx + 8y = 7 \\hspace{2cm} (2)$$\nThe goal is to find when there is no solution, which is when these two equations are inconsistent. To see this, let\u2019s write this system in matrix form:\n$$\\begin{bmatrix} 6 & 4 \\\\ K & 8 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 7 \\\\ 7 \\end{bmatrix}$$\nso that we can use row reduction.

We solve $\\frac{7-K}{6} = 0$ to obtain that $K = \\boxed{7}.$",
        " \nWe add the two equations together so that we add the x terms together and add the y terms together:\n``'(6x + 4y) + (Kx + 8y) = 7 + 7''\nSimplifying the left-hand side:\n``'(6 + K)x + (4 + 8)y''\nThe equation now becomes:\n``'(6 + K)x + 12y = 14''\nWe want there not to be any solutions.  Let\u2019s think about what would happen if there are real numbers x and y.\n### The notion is that:\nIf we have two constants $6+K$ and $12$, and $14$, they would have to cancel out while adding.  Then, the sum of these two constants $6+K$ and $12$ would have to be equal to $14$. Then, we should find the value of K that makes this true. Now, let\u2019s look at $6+K + 12 = 14$. We should solve for K. The equation is:\n``'6 + K + 12 = 14''\nCombine like terms on the left:\n``'18 + K = 14''\nThen, subtract 18 from each side:\n``'K = 14 - 18''\nAfter subtracting we get: $K = -4$",
        " By subtracting the above two equations from each other, we have: $$-(x+(2/3))y = 0.$$ It is only possible to happen if y=0. Now subtituting y=0 into the original system of equations will give: $$6x=7 \\rightarrow x = \\frac{7}{6}$$ $$8y=7 \\rightarrow y= \\frac{7}{8}$$ We now take the first row and subtract the value of x in it from the second row, so that our new system has K values, and this system should not have any real solution.
