        " We get the information from the $\\log$ equation. The base is $3^2=9$, and inside the $\\log$, we have $(x-1)^2$, note that it has to be squared!

The $\\log$ only has a $1$ as exponent on the base, yet here, we have a $-1$ How do we make sense of this? How do we tackle the $\\log$ equation?\n### Discussion:\nIn math problems, we have to look at all parts of a problem carefully and use all our knowledge.  So here, we see that we need to take the exponent of the $\\log$ to its base.  And we see that it is $\\log$ raised to the $1$ power, so we don\u2019t need to do anything there.

We first converted the equation into it\u2019s exponential form and simplified it to become $9^{-1} \\log_{9}(x-1)^2 = 1$.

If we rewrite the $\\log$ expression using the change-of-base formula, we have\n$$\\frac{\\log(x-1)^2}{\\log 9} = -1.$$We can simplify this equation:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{\\log(x-1)^2}{2\\log 3} &= -1 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad \\log(x-1)^2 &= -2\\log 3 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad (x-1)^2 &= \\frac{1}{9} \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x-1 &= \\pm\\frac{1}{3}.\n\\end{align*}Thus, the two solutions to the equation are obtained by taking\n$$x = 1 + \\frac{1}{3}\\quad\\text{and}\\quad x = 1 - \\frac{1}{3},$$\nwhich have an average or sum of $\\frac{4}{3}$.\n Final Answer: The final answer is 4/3. I hope it is correct.  By using of the change-of-base formulae, we can see that the equation $\\log_{3^2}(x-1)^2 = -1$ can also be written as\n$(x-1)^2 = 3^{-2}$\n Therefore, taking the square root on both sides, we can obtain\n$\\left| x-1 \\right| = \\frac{1}{3}$\nSo, $x-1 = \\pm\\frac{1}{3},$ or, equivalently, $x = 1\\pm\\frac{1}{3}$ as shown here. Hence, the sum of all possible values of $x$ for which $\\log_{3^2}(x-1)^2 = -1$ equals\n$\\frac{4}{3}$.\nNote by Steven Zheng",
        " \nFirst we write $\\log_{9}(x-1)^2 = -1$.\nNext we take $9$th root of both sides to get $(x-1)^2 = 1/9$. Now we take both sides to the power of $\\frac{1}{2}$ to get $|x-1| = \\frac{1}{3}$.

Using this property, we can rewrite the equation as follows,$$(x-1)^2=9.$$Since the function $f(x)=x^2$ is an injective function, we can reverse it and conclude that the equation $x-1=3$ is equivalent to the original equation.
