    "solution": "You can multiply the binomials in the order $(x-2)(x-2)(x+2)(x+2)$, but multiplying $(x-2)(x+2)$ first and then squaring the result means fewer terms to worry about since $-2x$ and $2x$ cancel each other. When we multiply $(x-2)(x+2)$, we get $x^2+2x-2x-4=x^2-4$. There is another set of $(x-2)(x+2)$ that also equals $(x^2-4)$. So, the simplified expression is $(x^2-4)(x^2-4)=x^4-8x^2+16$. The product of the coefficients is $1\\cdot-8\\cdot16=\\boxed{-128}$.",

Then, to get the product of the nonzero coefficients, we multiply $$8\\times 24 = 192$$. Thus, the required product is 192. Alternatively, you could do polynomial long division with remainder of the polynomial $$(x-2)^2(x+2)^2 = x^4 - 8x^3 + 24x^2 +8x+16$$by $x^4+0x^3+0x^2+0x+0$$, which directly gives you the quotient 1 and remainder 192, which is the required product.  If you are really lazy, you can do factoring after ``synthetic division`` $x^4-8x^3+24x^2+8x +16$by $$x-2$$.  This also directly gives you $$x^3+x^2-4x+4$$as quotient and 192 as remainder.

What a mess!\nDivide this problem up into steps. We can start with the same thing from both terms containing the variable $$x$$: $$x^2$$. There are two such terms, one of which is from the product: $$x^2 - 4x$$ and $$x^2 + 4x$$. When multiplied together, they will produce a term of $$x^4$$. The coefficient will be 1.\nNext, we combine the two terms which are different in terms of sign, and then we multiply them together. Here we have: $$(-4x)(4x) = -16x^2$$. When all this is combined with the previous product, we get $$x^4 - 16x^2$$.\nWe now have three terms left, with the variables all squared, and separated in terms of sign. We can do the following multiplication: $$(4)(4) = 16$$. For the term containing 4x, we can multiply 4 times 4x. This becomes 16x. Next, we do the multiplication following the constant 4. We get (4)(4) = 16.\nWhen this is all combined, we get $$x^4 - 16x^2 + 64$$. So, the answer is 64.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 64.
