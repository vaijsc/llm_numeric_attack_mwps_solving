        " The total cost of the green technology is$\\$10,\\!000$ and includes a one-time installation cost of $\\$10,\\!000$dollars, and annual maintenance costs of$\\$650$dollars each year. Each year you save$\\$1200$ and that will be the amount that you will save each year. To pay back the cost, the savings per year need to pay back the cost plus add the cost of maintenance per year.\nSo, in the first year, the cost of maintenance is $\\$650$and the savings are$\\$1200$. This left the green technology to make $\\$1200$-$\\$650=\\$550$ profit. In the second year, it will still save $\\$1200$ and that$\\$1200$ will also go towards paying the cost. In the third year, the green technology will make a profit of $\\$1200$-$\\$650=\\$550$. So the total profit in three years will be $550+550=\\$1100$.

The amount saved per year is $\\$1200t$ dollars. We are supposed to recuperate your costs. The cost of the green technology will be equivalent to the amount saved after t years. Thus, we can set up the equation: \\begin{align*} 10000+650t&=1200t\\\\ 650t&=1200t-10000\\\\ 1200t-650t&=10000\\\\ 550t&=10000\\\\ t&=\\frac{10000}{550} \\end{align*} ### Final Answer: The final answer is 18 years. I hope it is correct. Let t be the number of years it takes to return the costs on the green technology. The total cost of installing and maintaining the green technology is$10,000 + $650t$ per year. The amount saved per year is $\\$1200t$? The cost of the green technology will be equivalent to the amount saved after t years. Thus, we can set up the equation: $$650t = 1200t - 10000$$ $$1200t-650t = 10000$$ $$550t = 10000$$ $$t = \\frac{10000}{550}$$\nt = 18 years.

A: The Nobel Prize in Physics goes to a maximum of three people because of a tradition started by the will of Alfred Nobel. Nobel, the founder of the Nobel Prizes, specified in his will that each prize would go to a maximum of three people. He wanted to limit the number of people who could receive the prize in order to ensure that the prize remained exclusive and prestigious. This tradition has been followed ever since the first Nobel Prizes were awarded in 1901. Q: According to the will of Alfred Nobel, how many prizes can be awarded in each year\u2019s ceremony? A: According to Alfred Nobel\u2019s will, a maximum of five prizes can be awarded in each year\u2019s Nobel Prize ceremony: the Nobel Prize in Physics, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, the Nobel Prize in Medicine, the Nobel Peace Prize, and the Nobel Prize in Literature.

        " Let $n$ be the number of years it takes to recuperate your costs. The one-time installation cost will be paid back in $n$ years as the annual savings in energy bills multiplied by the number of years, so $10,\\!000 = 1,\\!200n$. Dividing both sides by $1,\\!200$, we can solve for $n$:\\begin{align*} 10,\\!000&=1,\\!200n \\\\ 10,\\!000/1,\\!200&=n\\\\ n&=\\boxed{8.333...}.\\end{align*}Rounding down to the nearest whole number, we find that $n = 8$ whole years.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 8. I hope it is correct. ### Final Answer: The final answer is 8. I hope it is correct.  Please let me know if you have any other questions.  Thanks for asking!  I'm here to help.  Have a great day!
