Since $n-1$ and $n-2$ are consecutive, we shouldn\u2019t have any cases in which they\u2019re both odd, so they must both be even. And that stops things from being a little difficult to solve.

We want to count how many positive integers $n$ satisfy $(n-1)(n-2)+1$ is odd for any number. We note that $n$ must be odd for $(n-1)(n-2)+1$ to be odd. If $n$ is even, we can write $n=2k$ where $k$ is a positive integer. Then, $n^2-3n+2=(2k-1)(2k-2)+1=2k-3$ which is not an odd number. Therefore, we assume that $n$ is odd.

Let's rewrite it as a product: $$n^2-3n+2 = (n-a)(n-b),$$ by completing the square. When we do, we find that $a+b = 3$ and $ab = 2$. We know that the only pairs of integers with product $2$ are $(1,2)$ and $(2,1)$. Furthermore, $a+b=3$ means that either $a$ and $b$ are both even, or one is even and the other is odd. Since $1$ is odd, and $2$ is even, the only possibility is that $a = 1$ and $b=2$. This gives us $$n^2-3n+2 = (n-1)(n-2).$$\nSo, we can rewrite our equation as the product of two factors.

I hope it is correct. #### Better Late Than Never, I Guess! #### Why 4? This question is somewhat unique because it\u2019s not asking for an expression of f(n) in terms of something simpler, like polynomials. Instead, it is asking us to determine if f(n) is always prime. Using the distributive property, we can find a factorization. Factoring out a 2, we have: $f(n)= 2(n-1)(n-2) + 2 = 2((n-1)n - (n-1) + n-2) + 2$ which simplifies to: $2(n-\\frac{1}{2})^2 + 2$. If we set $x = n-\\frac{1}{2}$, we can",
        " We can write\n\\begin{align*}\nn^2-3n+2 &= n^2 -3n + \\frac{3^2}{4} - \\frac{3^2}{4} + 2 \\\\\n&= \\left(n-\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2 + \\frac{1}{4}.\n\\end{align*}\nSince $\\left(n-\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2$ is nonnegative, we know that $\\left(n-\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2$ is equal to 0 or greater than 0. If $\\left(n-\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2 = 0,$ then $n = \\frac{3}{2}$ (which is not an integer).\nIf $\\left(n-\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2 >0$, then $\\left(n-\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2 + \\frac{1}{4} > \\frac{1}{4}$. Therefore, $\\left(n-\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2 + \\frac{1}{4}$ cannot be a prime number. Thus, the only possibility for $\\left(n-\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2 + \\frac{1}{4}$ to be a prime number is when $\\left(n-\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2 = 0$, which does not happen when $n$ is an integer. Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{0}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 0. I hope it is correct."
