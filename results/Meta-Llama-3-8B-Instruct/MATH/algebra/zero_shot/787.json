        " First, we rearrange the given equation as $x^2+12 = 3m^2+12$. Then, factoring the left side of the equation results in $(x^2-3m^2) = 0$, or $(x-m)(x+m) = 0$. This has only one solution, $x=m$. The constant on the left side is 12, just as in the original equation. If we simplify the equation, we find that $f(m) = 3m^2+12$. This is helpful since we can simplify $f(3m)$ by replacing $x$ with $3m$: \\begin{align*} f(3m) &= (3m)^2+12 \\\\ &= 9m^2+12 \\\\ &= 3m^2+6m^2+12 \\\\ &= 3m^2+6m^2+6m+6m+12 \\\\ &= 3(m^2+2m)+6(m+2) \\\\ &= 3(f(m))+6(m+2) \\\\ &= f(m)+2(3m+2) \\\\ &= f(m)+6(m+1) \\end{align*} The last part tells us that the value of $f(3m)$ is $f(m)+6(m+1)$, which is 3 times the value of $f(m)$, including the constant of 12. So we must substitute $f(m)=3(m^2+12)$, to get \\begin{align*} f(3m) &= 3m^2+12+6(3m+2) \\\\ &= 3m^2+12+18m+12 \\\\ &= 3(m^2+6m+12) \\\\ &= 3(f(m)) \\\\ &= 3(3m^2+12) \\\\ &= 9m^2+36 \\\\ &= 3m^2+6m^2+6m+6m+36 \\\\ &= 3(m^2+2m)+6(m+3) \\\\ &= 3(f(m))+6(m+3) \\\\ &= f(m)+2(3m+3) \\\\ &= f(m)+6(m+1) \\\\ \\end{align*} Here, we are going to compare the final expression, $f(m)+6(m+1)$, and $f(3m)-f(m) = 6(m+1",
