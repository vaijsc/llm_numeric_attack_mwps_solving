        "To solve the equation \\(\\frac{n+5}{n-3} = 2\\), we can follow these steps:\n1. **Cross-Multiply**: To eliminate the fraction, we multiply both sides of the equation by \\(n - 3\\):\n   \\[\n   n + 5 = 2(n - 3)\n   \\]\n2. **Distribute on the Right Side**: We distribute \\(2\\) on the right side:\n   \\[\n   n + 5 = 2n - 6\n   \\]\n3. **Rearrange the Equation**: We want to isolate \\(n\\).

        " \n### Step 1: Cross multiply\nThe best way to solve this kind of equation is to cross multiply. Let\u2019s do that:\n\\begin{align}\n(n+5)(n-3) &= 2(n-3)(n+5) \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad \\quad n^2 + 2n - 15 &= 2n^2 - 6n - 30 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad 0 &= n^2 - 8n + 15\n\\end{align}\n### Step 2: Solve for $n$\nLet\u2019s try to solve for $n$:\n$$n^2 - 8n + 15 = 0$$ It is always difficult to find a quadratic solution by hand, so we can use the quadratic formula:\n\\begin{align*}\nn &= \\frac{8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 4 \\cdot 15}}{2} \\\\\n &= \\frac{8 \\pm 4}{2} \\\\\n &= 6, 1\n\\end{align*}\n### Answer:\nOnly $n=1$ is a solution.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is n = 1. I hope it is correct.",
        " First we find the common denominator:\n$$\\frac{n+5}{n-3} = 2$$\nThen multiply both sides by $(n-3)$ to cancel.\n$$\\frac{(n+5)(n-3)}{(n-3)} = 2(n-3)$$ $$n+5 = 2n - 6$$\nSubtract $n$ from both sides.\n$$5 = n -6$$\nAdd $6$ to both sides.\n$$11 = n$$\nThus, $n = \\boxed{11}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 11.

I'll do my best to help. Just until you understand or solve your problem while you continue to do your assignment challenge do not hesitate.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 11. I hope it is correct. I hope my response helps you well. And remember if you have any questions during your math problems and how they are solved, you can contact me because my goal is to help you learn math. Have a great day!:) Best regards.\nPlease do not forget that even if the problem is hard, if you just want an answer for school, as well teacher. Please try to the problem by yourself first, and come up with a couple of thoughts before writing them. And only ask if you have a problem or question and it gives me the moment as well as I will be there to help you. And it helps you solve a problem and also helps you think like you learn. Because I encourage your proactive thinking but also, as needed, I'll be there to help you. Good luck, and please feel free to comment, and we'll r continue this thing together. Good luck with your math class. I appreciate the support and time. And if you needed more support weird",
