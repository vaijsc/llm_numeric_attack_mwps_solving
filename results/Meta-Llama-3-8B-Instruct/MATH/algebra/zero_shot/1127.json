        " 1.8\n(**Summary**) 1.8. **Solution:** We are asked to find the minimum distance between the origin (0, 0) and each point (x, y) = (x, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt 2} (x^2 - 3)) in the graph. Therefore, we will find the minimum value of d = \\sqrt{(x-0)^2 + (y-0)^2} = \\sqrt{x^2+\\frac{1}{2} (x^2-3)^2}. We can simplify by squaring the expression. This gives 2x^2 + \\frac{1}{4} x^4 + \\frac{9}{4}. Completing the square gives 2x^2 + \\frac{1}{4} x^4 + \\frac{9}{4} = (\\frac12 x)^4 + 1.5x^2 + 1.25. Now, we will write the expression in the form (x-\\alpha)^2+\\beta^2. This gives 1.5x^2 = (\\sqrt 3 x)^2+0.125. Under this form, we can simplify d^2 = 2x^2+\\frac14 x^4+ \\frac94 = (\\frac12 x)^4 + 1.5x^2+1.25 = 1.5x^2+(\\sqrt 3 x)^2+0.125 + 1 = 2(\\sqrt3 x)^2+0.125 + 1. Now, we use the identity a^2+b^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 - 2ab = (a+b)^2 - 2ab, with a = \\sqrt3 x and b = \\frac12. This gives d^2 = \\frac5 2 + (\\sqrt{\\frac9 4}- \\frac12)^2. The minimum value of d occurs when the expression (\\sqrt{\\frac9 4}- \\frac12)^2 is minimized at 0. This occurs when \\sqrt{\\frac94}- \\frac12 = 0. Solving this equation, we get x = \\frac{\\sqrt3}{\\sqrt\\frac34}. Substituting this into (- \\frac{\\sqrt3}{\\sqrt\\frac34})^2 = \\frac34 into the original equation gives y=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt 2}",

        " Find $a$.\nRecall that y- coordinate of a point on a graph of a function is nothing but a function evaluation.  So, let\u2019s start by expressing the distance between the origin $(0,0)$ and a point $(x,y)$ on the graph of the function.  The distance is given by $\\sqrt{(x-0)^2+(y-0)^2}$ and it can be simplified to $\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}.$  To find $y$, we have to evaluate $y$ from the given equation, and we can simplify it to $$y=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(x^2-3\\right)$$ Since we are interested in finding the distance between the origin and $(x,\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2-3))$ we can express $y$ in terms of $x$ as\n$$y=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}x^2-\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}}.$$So, now, the distance between $(0,0)$ and $(x,\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}x^2-\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}})$ is given by\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sqrt{x^2+\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}x^2-\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2}\n&=\\sqrt{x^2+\\left(\\frac{1}{2}x^2-\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2}\\\\\n&=\\sqrt{x^2+\\left(\\frac{1}{2}x^2-\\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}x^2-\\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)}\\\\\n&=\\sqrt{x^2+\\frac{3}{4}x^4-\\frac{9\\sqrt{2}}{2}x^2+\\frac{18}{2}}\\\\\n&=\\sqrt{\\left(x^2-\\frac{9\\sqrt{2}}{4}\\right)^2+\\frac{27}{4}}\\\\\n&=\\sqrt{\\left(x^2-\\frac{9\\sqrt{2}}{4}\\right)^2+\\frac{27}{4}-9\\sqrt{2}}\\\\\n&=\\sqrt{\\left(x^2-\\frac",
        " A nice problem! Suppose $y$ is equal to zero. So, \\begin{align*}\n0 &=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (x^2-3)\\\\\n0 &=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}x^2-3.\n\\end{align*}Notice that we do not have to solve for $x$ here, but only make a note that the minimum value of $y$ is almost surely nonzero. (Note $y=0$ gives $x=\\pm\\sqrt{6}$, but there\u2019s something interesting about the graph). Now, we can complete the square: \\begin{align*}\n2y+3 &= x^2/\\sqrt{2}\\\\\n2y+3 &= x^2/\\left(\\sqrt{2}\\right).\n\\end{align*}Now, if we graph this parabola, it will be a parabola that opens upwards, with the vertex at $(0, 3/\\sqrt{2})$. So, this will be our expected minimum value, $y=\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}}$. Now, we just have to figure out the distance of this from the origin. That is, we will get our minimum when $y=\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}}$. So, let\u2019s plug this value in.\n(This is quite easy). \\begin{align*}\ny &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(x^2 - 3\\right)\\\\\n\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}} &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(x^2 - 3\\right)\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 3\\sqrt{2} &= x^2 - 3\\\\\n6\\sqrt{2} &= x^2\\\\\n\\end{align*}So $x = \\pm\\sqrt{6\\sqrt{2}}$.

How to solve this question?  To obtain the graph of the equation, I need to start with the vertex of the parabola. Please see the following solution below.\nStep 1: Move the constant term to the right-hand side:\n$y = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}x^2 - \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}}$\nStep 2: Divide both sides of the equation by $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$:\n$y^2 = x^2 - \\frac{6}{\\sqrt{2}}$\nStep 3: Move the $x^2$ term to the right-hand side:\n$y^2 - x^2 = \\frac{6}{\\sqrt{2}}$\nStep 4: Move the constant term to the right-hand side by dividing both sides by $\\sqrt{2}$:\n$\\frac{y^2 - x^2}{\\sqrt{2}} = 3$\nIf we now graph the equation $\\frac{y^2 - x^2}{\\sqrt{2}} = 3$, we can find a vertex at the origin $(x, y) = (0, 0)$ since we can rewrite this equation as follows:\n$\\frac{(y - h)^2 - (x - k)^2}{\\sqrt{2}} = 3$\nBy letting $y = h$ and $x = k$ and by using some knowledge of the coordinates of the vertex of parabolas with the general form in the equation $y = a(x - h)^2 + k$",
        " \nBegin by using the method of completing the square to rewrite the quadratic function in the form $$y=default+ax+\\frac{b}{a}(x-h)^2.$$Now the constant term $default$ should be zero, because we are trying to find the distance to the origin $$(0,0).$$Let\u2019s do the expansion: $frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}left(x^2-3right)=frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}left(x^2-2cdotfrac{3}{2}+frac{3}{2}-3right)=frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}left((x-sqrt{frac{3}{2}})^2-frac{3}{2}right).$$For small arguments -(x-sqrt{frac{3}{2}})^2 to be large, we must have x close to sqrt{frac{3}{2}}. So x = 0 doesn\u2019t generate the minimum. Plugging in x = sqrt{frac{3}{2}}: $$frac{1}{sqrt{2}}left(sqrt{frac{3}{2}}^2-frac{3}{2}-3right)=frac{1}{sqrt{2}}left(-frac{3}{2}-3right)=frac{-3sqrt{2}-3sqrt{2}}{2sqrt{2}}=frac{-6sqrt{2}}{2sqrt{2}}=-3.$$So default = -3, a = 1/(\\sqrt{2}), b = sqrt{2}, and h = sqrt{3/2}. The distance is sqrt{(sqrt{3/2}-3)^2+(0-0)^2} = sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}-3}=\\frac{sqrt{3}}{sqrt{2}}, so we have a+b=3.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 3. I hope it is correct.",
        " First, we expand the original equation. \\begin{align*}\ny&=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(x^2-3\\right)\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}x^2-\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}}\\\\\n&=\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}x^2-\\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\quad \\mbox{(dividing by $\\sqrt{2}$)}\\tag{1}\n\\end{align*} With this form of the equation, we can find the vertex by coloring $a$ from the quadratic expression, which dictates $y=-\\frac{b}{2a}\\Rightarrow-\\frac{\\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{2}}{\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}}=-3.$ Therefore, the vertex is $\\left(0,-\\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right).$ To find the $y$-intercept, $x=0$ so $0\\cdot\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}-\\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{2}=-\\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{2}.$ This makes sense, since we already had found the value of the vertex. In fact, we know that the vertex, the $y$-intercept, and the lowest point on the parabola\u2019s graph are at the same height (i.e., $-\\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{2}$). The other thing that looks interesting is the axis of symmetry, which passes through the vertex, so its $x$-coordinate is 0. To find where the parabola reaches its lowest point (and thus the other point on this line of symmetry), $y=-\\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{2}$ and %\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}x^2-\\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{2}&=-\\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\\\\n\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}x^2&=0\\\\\nx^2&=0\\\\\nx&=0\\quad \\mbox{(the axis of symmetry)}\\\\\nx&=\\boxed{\\pm\\sqrt{2}}\\quad\\mbox{(the points where the parabola reaches its lowest point)}\\",

        " We know that the equation gives the height above the $x$-axis and the $y$-axis, and that the vertical distance from the origin to the graph of the equation is given by $y$.  Thus we only need to find the vertex of $y-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}x^2+3$.  Since the given equation is already rewritten, the completing the square will be a bit tricky.  Hence, $\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}}$.  So $y-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}x^2+3-\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}}=\\left(x^2-\\frac{6}{\\sqrt{2}}x\\right)+\\left(3-\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)$.  If we organize $x^2-\\frac{6}{\\sqrt{2}}x$, we will have $x^2-\\frac{6}{\\sqrt{2}}x+\\frac{9}{2}=\\left(x^2-\\frac{6}{\\sqrt{2}}x+\\frac{9}{2}\\right)-\\frac{9}{2}$.  Gathering the coefficients, we will have $\\left(x-\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2-F$.  Therefore, $y=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(x^2-3\\right)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(\\left(x-\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2-\\left(\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2\\right)$.  When $y=0$, $x=\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}}$.  Since we wish to minimize the distance to the origin $(0,0)$, we must find the point on the graph of the equation such that the distance to the origin is a minimum.  Thus we must find the point where $x=\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}}$ and $y=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(\\frac{9}{2}-3\\right)=0$.  So $(\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}},0)$ is the point on the graph with a minimum distance to the origin.  As we know that $x^2-3",
