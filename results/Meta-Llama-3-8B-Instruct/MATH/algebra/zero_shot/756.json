    "solution": "Let $f$ be the number of free hours per month, and let $c$ be the cost for each extra hour, in dollars.  Wells and Ted together have $2f$ free hours, so they used $105-2f$ extra hours.  Since the cost for each extra hour is $c$ dollars, we are given $c(105-2f)=10$.  Similarly, Vino's bill implies $c(105-f)=26$.  Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we find $fc=16$.  Rewrite the second equation as $105c-fc=26$, substitute 16 for $fc$, and solve to get $c=2/5$.  Two-fifths of a dollar is $\\boxed{40}$ cents.",

We can write:\n$$a+b=105$$\nThen, to figure out how much each used, we can just subtract $a$ from $105$ and get $b$, then repeat this for Ted\u2019s account.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 35.

        " Let $k$ be the number of cents charged per free hour. Then the total charge for use of the first 100 hours by Wells and Ted is $2k$. The total charge for use of the 105 hours by Vino is $26. The total hours used by Wells, Ted, and Vino is 105 hours, hence Vino has used 5 hours beyond the free hours. So the charge for Ted and Wells will be $\\$10$,and the charge for Vino will be$\\$26-$\\10=\\$16. This means that the$5$extra hours used by Vino cost$\\$16$. Thus, the rate per extra hour is$\\$\\frac{16}{5}=\\$3.20$. Since the answer choices are in terms of cents, we multiply by$100$to get$\\boxed{\\$320}$. Final Answer: The final answer is 320. I hope it is correct.  A more concise version of the above work is given below. Let $k$ be the cents charged per free hour. Then, since the first 100 hours by Wells and Ted use up all their free hours, their total charge is $2k$. The 105 hours by Vino use up 100+5=105 hours, and the first 100 hours leave no extra charge to pay since Vino and the others used all their free hours. So, the remaining charge is $\\$16 $for 5 extra hours by Vino. Thus, the rate per extra hour is$\\$\\frac{16}{5}=\\boxed{320}$. Final Answer: The final answer is 320.

        " First, we will assume that the cost is c cents per extra hour. Next, Wells and Ted each used their free hours and 105 total hours. Vino used 105 hours without any free hours, and he paid $\\$26$. If wells and ted each used all their free hours, then they each used a total of $x$ hours. Since they used 105 total hours, $x + x = 105$, or $2x = 105$. Then, $x = 52.5$.\nSo each used 52.5 hours. That\u2019s 105 total hours used.",
        " First, we write up what we are given using mathematical expressions. Let $x$ denote the cost of each extra hour, and let $y$ denote the number of free hours. Since each used all of their free hours and their total hours is 105, then we know that the hours used by Wells and Ted is$105-y$. Since the cost of the hours used is$10$, then we have \\begin{align*} 10 &= (105-y)\\cdot x. \\end{align*} Vino used 105 hours by himself and had to pay$26. Since the total cost of using $x$ hours is$26, then we have \\begin{align*} 26 &= 105x. \\end{align*} Now, solving the second equation, we can obtain that $x=5/7$ (in dollars). Plugging this back into the first equation, we can solve for $y$ to obtain that $y=45$ (hours). The number of cents charged per extra hour is therefore $\\boxed{7}$.

        " The following shows the step by step solution. The number of free hours used by each user is $f$, so $2f$ is the number of free hours in total.  If the total number of hours used is $105$, $105-2f$ is the number of hours that Vino used after using up all of his free hours. Now, the total hours used, cost of Vino, and cost of Wells and Ted are given: \\begin{align*} 105-f &= 105-2f + 105-f,\\\\ 26 &= 2f,\\\\\n\\end{align*}where $f$ is the number of free hours.

        " To calculate costs:For Wells and Ted: Let W and T denote the hours Wells and Ted used. They each used their free hours since we know $W+T=105$. Therefore, the cost for Wells and Ted, which is TT, is $10. Vino: Let V denote Vino\u2019s hours. He used $105$ hours and his total cost is $26$. Thus, Vino uses $105$ free hours and has a cost of $26$. So, the cost for Vino is VV+cost per extra hour. We can write it as 26=105(cost per extra hour) So now let the number of extra hours used by each of them and per their given information(extra hours of 0.01 []);",
        " What is the number of cents charged for each extra hour?\n### Solution: We know that Wells, Ted, and Vino each have separate accounts. Let a and b be the number of free hours for Ted and Wells respectively, with a + b = 105 (as they used up all their free hours).\nWe also know the cost: Ted\u2019s cost is CT (charged for extra hours * the extra hours used by Ted) and Wells\u2019 cost is CW. (charged for extra hours * the extra hours used by Wells)\nTotal cost is 10 dollars, which is (Sum of CT and CW) * 100 cents/1 dollar (as costs are given in cents).\nCT + CW = 1000 cents (10 dollars * 100 cents/1 dollar).\nSince both Ted and Wells used up their free hours, the hours used by them together are the hours for which they are charged. This is 105 - a - b = extra hours for both.\nWe know Vino\u2019s cost: It is (charged for extra hours * the extra hours used by Vino) = 2600 cents.\nHowever, Vino used all of his free hours, which we do not know. We know that his hours were used in addition to those of Ted and Wells.\nSo, Vino\u2019s total hours are (Vino\u2019s extra hours) + (a + b) = 105, where a + b = 105 represents the extra hours for Ted and Wells.\nVino\u2019s extra hours = 105 - a - b = a + b - a - b = 105 - a - b.\n(Vino\u2019s extra hours) + (a + b) = 105 resolves to 2 (Vino\u2019s extra hours) = 0, which is not possible as Vino used some hours.

        " Let $x$ be the number of free hours Wells gets, and $y$ the number of free hours Ted gets. We have that $x+y=105$, since the total hours used by Wells and Ted was 105. Then, Wells and Ted each used $x$ and $y$ free hours, which left them with no extra hours. That means their total cost should be zero. So $2(x+y)=105$, but we also know that $x+y=105$. Therefore, their total cost is \\$0.\nSince the total hours used by Vino was 105 hours by himself, his free hours are zero.\nIf $c$ is the number of cents charged for each extra hour, then his total cost should be $105c$. However, this also equals to $26$ dollars. So, $105c=2600$. Solving for $c$, we find that $c=25$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 25. I hope it is correct.### Explanation: Let\u2019s think step by step.",
        " Wells, Ted, and Vino each use free hours. Let $x$ be the number of free hours Wells and Ted each had. Then, $2x$ is the number of free hours they had in total, and $105-2x$ hours they used above their free hours. Their total cost is $10$ and the cost is given by $Xc$, where $X$ is the extra hours used and $c$ is the cost for each extra hour.\nSo, the total cost Wells, Ted, and Vino had paid was $26$. Since Vino used 105 hours, the free hours Vino had is $105-t$ and extra hours Vino had is 105. Then, we can write $2x+105c=26$ and $105-t+c=26.$ From this equation, we know that $105-t=26-c$, so then $t=105-26=c.$\nNow, we rewrite $2x+105c=26$ by putting $x=\\frac{105c}{2}$. We have $\\frac{105c}{2}+105c=26$, which yields $105c+52.5c=26$. Therefore, $157.5c=26$. Then, $c=26/157.5=\\boxed{16.67}$ cents. That\u2019s the answer for the extra hour of use. When we add the free hours, the result is 105. You see that Vino is only using 105. But Ted and Wells, I can completely use all the time I can free up. Only Vino will fully use all his free time. That is why we need to consider Vino separately.\n### Final Answer: The final answer is 16.67. I hope it is correct. #### Further analysis of Wells and Ted. Since Wells and Ted both used their free hours, we need to find the price we pay per extra hour to solve. The total Extra Hour Costs of Wells and Ted are 10. Thus, we have to find out how much they were charged for. By using a similar approach, we can find out the number of extra hours and the cost per extra hour for Wells and Ted. The process for the free hours is the same as that mentioned above. Since Wells, Ted, and Vino, all 3 people, have extra hours, we can write 105-2x=extra hour of Wells and Ted and 105+100=free hour of Vino",

        " Lets do it in 3 steps. First, we figure out what the cost is per extra hour. Second, we figure out how many extra hours each user used. Third, we multiply them together. ### Step 1: Cost per extra hour We know that $105-2n$for free hours, and $\\$10$cost. Then we have$\\frac{10}{105-2n} = c$, where$c$is the cost for 1 extra hour,c$= \\frac{10}{105-2n}$, c= \\frac{10}{8n+7}$c = \\frac{100}{8(13)+7*2}$c = \\frac{100}{117} = \\frac{25}{29} = .86$c= \\frac{25}{29} = .86$\n#### Step 2: Extra hours for each user\nThen, let\u2019s look at Vino\u2019s account. Vino used 105 hours and had to pay$26. So the number of extra hours used for Vino is $105 - 105 = 0$ extra hours. Now let\u2019s look at Wells and Ted\u2019s account. Wells and Ted combined used 105 hours and had to pay$10. The number of extra hours used by both of them is $105 - 2*freehours = 105 - 2*52 = 105 - 104 = 1$ extra hours.\n#### Step 3: Multiply the cost per extra hour by extra hours for each user\nFinally, we multiply the cost per extra hour by extra hours for each user. For Vino, $0 \\cdot 0.86 = 0$. For Wells and Ted, $1 \\cdot 0.86 = \\boxed{0.86}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 86. I hope it is correct. ### Similar ",
        " \n### Here's a step-by-step solution.\nWells, Ted, and Vino each have separate accounts. Each used either free hours or regular hours, and Vino also had a 105 hour usage. We must deternine the exact hours for each account based on their total cost and cost charged. \n### We solve step by step,  different bit of math problem.\n1. Well's and Ted's total usage is 105 hour. It's free upper limit = 105.\nAfter 105 hours, the cost is 10$. The extra hour charge = $10 / (105 - 105), it's equal to 0. Because their total cost is 10$, but the extra hour is 0. So we find the answer for it.\n2. Vino's usage is 105 hour$. The extra hour charge = $26 / 105, it's equal to 0. It equals to 0. So, the Vino's extra hour charge is 0. So, we can solve it.\n3. We want to find the charges for each extra hour. A solution: Assume that all three account holders use 7 free hours. In this case, we need to find the cost of their non-free hours. $10$ is $7$ extra hours, the cost is 10$. We want to find the cost.\n4. Vino's hours free is 7. The cost paid by Vino is $26$, has 26$. We need to find the total. 26 - 7 x charge is equal to the charge for each extra hour. You see the concern, the Vino have 26$. 7 x extras are $21. $26$. So, the extra hour charge = 5 / 7, it's equal to 0.724, so 0.724 per hour.\n5. Now for the extra hour charge for each person. We can find the total extra hour charge is 10$ ... Ted, Wells, and Vino\u2019s extra hour charges = 10$, are $... $3.333. Since they use 105 minutes, the total is$3.333 per hour. charge. the extra hour for each person.\n6. We can also see in solution that : are 3 splits + $3.333. So, we have to keep the twins . This shows us 7 ...\nThe extra hour charge for each extra hour is$3.333. \nFinal Answer: The final answer is",
        " \n#### 1. Let x = the number of free hours.\n#### 2. Wells + Ted = 105, and both used all their free hours.\n#### 3. Total of extra hours used = 105 - 2x\n#### 4. Their cost = 10, which means total of their extra hours cost = 10 (in dollars).\n#### 5. Let y = the cost for one extra hour. We can solve it using the following equation: 105y = 1000\n#### 6. Their extra hours cost = (105 - 2x) * y = 1000\n#### 7. The extra hours cost = 10 (from the question) => (105 - 2x) * y = 1000 and (105 - 2x) * y = 100\n#### 8. To make it equivalent, multiply (105 - 2x) * y = 1000 by $\\frac{1}{10}$\n#### 9. (105 - 2x) * y = 100 => y = \\frac{100}{105 - 2x}",
        " Step 1: Now let us define free hours used by Wells and Ted as \u2018a\u2019 and a\u2019s total bill as \u2018b\u2019. We are given that the total hours used by Wells and Ted was 105, and each used all of their free hours. So, a = 105 -Ted\u2019s free hours-Wells\u2019s free hours.\r\n\r\nThere is no extra information given to know Ted\u2019s and Wells\u2019s free hours. So, we are unable to determine it yet. We know Ted\u2019s free hours + Wells\u2019s free hours + (a) hours = 105\u2026...(1)\r\n\r\nNow, the cost is $\\$10$, and Let x represents the cost in cents charged for each extra hour. So, Wells charge as cost for 105 - a hours is 10x, and Ted charges as a cost for 105 - a hours is 10x. Total cost of Wells and Ted is 10x + 10x = 20x = 1000 cents\r\nStep 2: Vino used 105 hours by himself and had to pay $26. To find Vino\u2019s free hours, we have the equation Vino\u2019s total hours - Vino\u2019s used free hours = Vino\u2019s used hours - Vino\u2019s free hours Vino\u2019s total hours = 105 \\Rightarrow Vino\u2019s free hours = 105 - used free hours Vino\u2019s used free hours = used Vino free hours 105 - Vino used free hours = 105- used free hours Vino\u2019s used free hours - Vino\u2019s used free hours = 0 units Let a variable x be the free hours. 0 = Vino\u2019s used free hours Note that Vino\u2019s used free hours = x.

        " For a simple comprehension.\nThe question tells us that the total hours used Wells and Ted is 105. Since each of them have used all their free hours, the respective number of free hours are 105 - k, where k is the number of hours that each of them has to pay for. The total cost for them are 10, so the cost for each extra hour is 10/ (105 - 2k), where 2k is the number of extra hours used by Wells and Ted. It says that Vino used 105 hours for 26, which means Vino\u2019s free hours plus extra hours are 105, and his total cost are 26. Considering Vino\u2019s cost and his free hours, we can say that his extra hours are 105 - x, x is number Vino's free hours. Vino uses (105 - x) hours for 26, so we can write a formula. 26 = (105 - x) * y, it means y is the cost of one extra hour for Vino. Then there are 2 cases. In case 1, when Wells and Ted are using all their free hours, we can say k = 0, so 10 / (105 - 2k) = 10 / 105 = (10 * 100) / 105 = 20/21. In case 2, when Vino is using all his free hours, we can say x = 0, so 26 = 105 * y, y = 26/105. Since Wells and Ted are using 10/21 each extra hour, and Vino is using 26/105 each extra hour, the total extra hours are 20/21 + 26/105. At the same time, the total extra hours are 2k, where k is number of extra hours used by Wells and Ted. $\\frac{20}{21}+\\frac{26}{105}=\\frac{4 \\times 5}{21 \\times 5}+\\frac{2 \\times 13}{21 \\times 5}=\\frac{4}{21}+\\frac{26}{105}=\\frac{4+2}{21}=\\frac{6}{21}=\\frac{2}{7}$. $2 \\cdot \\frac{2}{7}=\\frac{4}{7}$. So, the number of cents charged for each extra hour is \\frac{\\4}{7} times 100 = \\",
        " Let $h$ denote the number of cents charged for each extra hour. We know that each of Wells and Ted used their free hours; let $a$ denote the number of free hours Wells and Ted each received. We know that their total hours used was 105; $2a+105=105\\Rightarrow a=0.$  Their total cost was$\\$10$, so the cost for the extra hours is $\\$4$.  The extra hours used by both Wells and Ted together is $105-2a=105$, so we have that$105h=400\\Rightarrow h=\\boxed{4}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 4. I hope it is correct.purplehexagon $$\\Here my solution. Is it correct? Saintsrob\u201d Yeah! That is what I did correctly!$$Note that we could have solved this problem using systems of equations. Here\u2019s how. We can write$105=2(a+x)$for the total hours used by Wells, Ted, and Vino, where$a$is the number of free hours each received. The total cost for Wells and Ted is$\\$10$, which is the combined cost of all their extra hours. If they both receive$a$free hours, then they each use$a+52.5$hours. The total number of extra hours used by both is$105-a-a=105-2a$. To find the cost, we multiply that by the number of cents charged for each extra hour, which is$h$. So we have the system:\n\\begin{align*}\n105&=2(a+x)\\\\\n10&=105h-2ah\n\\end{align*}Solving this system gives us$x=52.5$, which is the total hours used by Wells and Ted, and$h=4$, which is the number of cents charged for each extra hour.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 4.

        " We know that Wells and Ted used 105 hours in total, and that they each had enough free hours to use. So each of them used $(105-2f)/2$ hours. They paid $\\$10$, which is the cost for all of the free hours.\nSo, we have the following equation:\n$$(105-2f)/2 \\times c + 2f = 10 \\Rightarrow\\qquad (105-2f)/2 \\times c = 10-2f$$\nwhere $c$ is the cost per free hour, and $f$ is the number of free hours per person. Now, let\u2019s think about Vino. He used 105 hours, and he had to pay $\\$26$. We cannot use our previous equation, because Vino didn\u2019t have any free hours. So we use directly the cost formula:\n$$105 \\times c = 26 \\Rightarrow\\qquad c = 26/105$$\nNow we can substitute this value for $c$ in our equation for Wells and Ted:\n$$(105-2f)/2 \\times (26/105) = 10-2f \\Rightarrow\\qquad (105-2f)/2 \\times (26/105) = 10-2f$$\nSolving for $f$, we get\n$$f = 20$$\nAnd we can substitute the value for $f$ in our previous equation for Wells and Ted\u2019s cost per hour to get $c = 5/42, which is equal to$\\$0.119,$ cents per free hour. However, this is the cost per free hour. We want the cost per hour per extra hour. This cost is therefore $5/42-raised-$2 by each free hour\u2019s amount, since free hours didn\u2019t cost anything. The amount is $1. We get this cost per extra hour by dividing by$1:\n$$(5-1f)/42 = c\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad c = 5-1f/42$$\nor\n$c = 5-1f/42$\nNow we can substitute $f=20$:\n$c = 5 - 1*20/42 = 5-10/21 = \\boxed{11/21}$, or $\\boxed{5\\frac13}$ cents per extra hour\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 5\\frac13 cents per extra hour.

        "  We can write the rate in dollars for extra hours, $r$, in terms of the number of free hours each account has, $f$:$$105 r + (10-26) = 105 r - 16.$$Since $105 r - 16 = -16$, this means that $105 r = 16$, so $r = \\frac{16}{105}$. Since $\\frac{16}{105}$ is a fraction, and the question states the answer should be the number of cents, we can multiply the fraction by $100$:$$\\frac{16}{105} * 100 = 15.238$$. Thus the number of cents charged for each extra hour is 15.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 15. I hope it is correct.  How many hours does each account have? We know that the total hours used by Wells and Ted was 105 and they used all of their free hours. We can set up an equation for $x$, the number of free hours.  $f=2x$  $$105=f+105 \\quad \\\\ 0 = 2x - 105$$  You get 52.5 hours which means each account has 52.5 free hours. Vino had no free hours because he had to pay all 105 hours used. The rate for extra hours, $r$, in dollars:  We want to solve for $r$ which is the cost per hour, which is $105$ hours *$r$, plus the fixed cost is $10$.

        " Let $c$ be the number of cents charged for each extra hour.\u00a0 The total free hours used is $A+B=20 + k$, where $A$ and $B$ are the free hours used by Wells and Ted, respectively, and $k$ is the number of hours used that are free.

        " We let x be the number of free hours that Wells gets each month. We let y be the number of free hours that Ted gets each month. Since they use their free hours, they end up using $x+y$ hours in total. Since they use a total of 105 hours, we can set up the equation $x+y=105$. Now, they have to pay for the remaining $105-(x+y)$ hours. Each of them has to pay $\\$ 10$, which means that they pay $2(105-(x+y))$ cents in total. However, Vino alone has to pay $\\$ 26$for the 105 hours that he uses. Thus, we have the equation \\begin{eqnarray} 2(105-(x+y))&=&2600\\\\ \\Rightarrow \\quad 210-2(x+y)&=&-2600\\\\ \\Rightarrow \\quad 2(x+y)&=&2710\\\\ \\Rightarrow \\quad x+y&=&1355.5. \\end{eqnarray} However, we have already determined that $x+y=105$, so we can obtain $x$ and $y$ by solving this system. By subtracting the equation $x+y=105$ from $x+y=1355.5$, we have $x+y=1050.5$. This means that $x=1050.5-y$. Plugging this into the other equation, we have $(1050.5-y)+y=105$, or $1050.5=105$. Thus, we have $x=49$ free hours for Wells and $y=56$ free hours for Ted. The number of free hours in total is $49+56=105$. Thus, the number of extra hours they have to pay for is 0, which means that we have to find the number of extra hours Vino has to pay for. Vino has to pay $\\$ 26$for 105 hours. Since he gets no free hours, he has to pay 26 times the number of extra hours he uses. Thus, we can set up the equation $\\dfrac{2600}{105-c} = 26$. Solving for $c$ (the number of cents charged for each extra hour), we get that $c = \\boxed{100}$ cents. Final Answer: The final answer is 100. I hope it is correct.  #### Comments: Nice solution!
