Divide the leading term of the numerator by the leading term of the denominator:\n   \\[\n   3x^2 \\div x = 3x\n   \\]\n2.

        " If $\\frac{3x^2-4x+1}{x-1}=m$, then multiplying both sides by $x-1$, we have $3x^2-4x+1=m(x-1)$. This is an equivalent statement to $3x^2-4x+1=m(x-1) \\iff 3x^2-4x+1-mx+M=0$, where $M=m-1$.

So, looking at the discriminant of the quadratic equation, we know that the side with the $x$ ^2-term and the $x$-term in the equation must be positive so that the discriminant can be less than zero. \nAlso, looking at the equation we have with respect to $m$, will we get an elimination of the $x$ terms (because of the $m$-terms) so that it can cancel out completely because there is a way to remove the $x$ terms from this equation? \nBecause of the constant term of the equation involving $m$, we modify the equation by combining the like terms, and it is adding constant $1$ to $3x^2-4x$ before",

In order for $\\frac{3x^2-4x+1}{x-1}=m$, simplify the fraction by mulitiplying both sides by $x-1$, because the numerator and denominator both have an $x-1$ \u2013 get $3x^2-4x+1$.
