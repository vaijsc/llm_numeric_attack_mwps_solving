        " \n### (hidden solution)\nThe parabola in the question is described by the equation $y = 2x^2 - 4x + 4$. We need to find the $x$-coordinate of the vertex, which is $m$. One way to find $m$ is to convert the equation of the parabola into vertex form $y = a(x - h)^2 + k$. For this, we first need to complete the square:\n$$y = 2x^2 - 4x + 4 = 2(x^2 - 2x + 2) = 2(x^2 - 2x + 1 + 1)$$\n$$= 2(x - 1)^2 + 2,$$\nwhere we added $1$ and $1$ in the last step to complete the square. The vertex of a parabola $y = a(x - h)^2 + k$ is at $(h, k)$. In this case, we have $h = \\boxed{1}$, so $m = 1$. Alternatively, we can use calculus to find the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola. The $x$-coordinate of the vertex is given by\n$$m = -\\frac{b}{2a} = -\\frac{-4}{2\\cdot2} = \\boxed{1},$$where we use the fact that $a = 2$ and $b = -4$ from the given equation.\n### End of Solution.\n",

        " Let\u2019s complete the square of the given equation to find the vertex. $$y=2x^2-4x+4 = 2(x^2-2x)+4$$  Now add $(1)^2 = 1$ to the parenthesis to complete the square. $$2(x^2-2x+1) + 4-2 = y$$  Simplify the equation to get $y=2(x-1)^2 + 2$ which is in standard form of a parabola.  The vertex is $(m,n) = (\\boxed{1}, 2)$. Final Answer: The final answer is 1. I hope it is correct.  It can be an administration mistake if it is not. Please double-check. It is the point $(1,2).$ Therefore, $m = 1.$\n### More Steps for Finding the Vertex\nIf you want to think about it, we can add and subtract $(2/2)^2=1$ from the equation. Then, we write the equation so that we can complete the square.\n$y = 2x^2 -4x + 4$\n= $2x^2-4x+2^2-2^2+4$\n$= 2(x^2-2x+1)-2+4$\n$= 2(x-1)^2+ 2$\n$=2(x-1)^2+2$\nThis is the equation of a parabola in vertex form. Its vertex is a point that lies on the parabola. This means that it is the minimum or maximum of the parabola. From the equation, we can see that we can find the vertex by setting $y$ to zero.\n$2(x-1)^2+2=0$\n$2(x-1)^2=-2$\n$$(x-1)^2=-1$\nThis means that it is impossible to find the vertex using this method. Instead, we can complete the square in another way. We can start with the equation, and add and subtract $(2/2)^2=1$ also.\n$y = 2x^2 -4x + 4$\n$= 2(x^2-2x+1)-8+4$\n$= 2(x-1)^2-4$\n$= 2(x-1)^2-4$\n$y=2(x-1)^2-4$. Now, we",

        " First, we need to complete the square.\nWe have $y=2x^2-4x+4$. To complete the square, we would like to find a perfect square of the form $a(x+b)^2+c$ which is reflected about the $x$-axis (i.e., it has a positive leading coefficient). We need to add or subtract terms from the right hand side until we achieve this form.\nStart by moving all to the left-hand side to get $0=2x^2-4x+4$.\nNext, we add $(\\frac{-4}{2})^2=4$ to both sides, which gives us\n$0=2x^2-4x+4+4 = 2(x^2-2x+4)$. Now we need to factor the linear terms in $x^2$, so we do this with $a$ and $b$. We get ( $2(x^2-2x+1+3) = 2((x-1)^2+3)$ ).\nSo our equation is now $0=2((x-1)^2+3)$. Now we can simplify:\n0=2(x-1)^2+6. Now we know that $0=(x-1)^2+3$ and that\u2019s our completed square. We know now that our equation is in the form $a(x+b)^2+c$. Now we have a problem: But we need to flip and therefore we subtract 3 from both sides.\n$-3=(x-1)^2$. That is what we wanted.

Comparing these with $ax^2-2amx+(am^2+n)$, we obtain the system \\begin{align*}\n&2=a\\\\\n&-2am=b=-4\\\\\n&am^2+n=c=4.\n\\end{align*}We can use the first equation to find $a$, and then substitute that into the second equation:\n\\begin{align*}\n&2=a\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\quad &-4=-2\\cdot 2m\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\quad &-2=2m\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\quad &m=\\boxed{-\\frac{1}{2}}.\n\\end{align*}We can check that our solution $m=-\\frac{1}{2}$ satisfies the last equation as well.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -\\frac{1}{2}.
