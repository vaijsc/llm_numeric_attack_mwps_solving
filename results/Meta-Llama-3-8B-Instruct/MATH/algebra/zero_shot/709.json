Can you immediately see it? Fundamentally Yes. However, it is a good practice to double-check our work to ensure it is accurate and precise. Hence, it is a good idea to graph the region, if possible.

        " Answer incorporate all the requirements such as answer in interval notation and reduced fractions\nWe have to find the set of all real numbers $p$ that satisfy both $54p-144\\leq0$ and $12-20p>0$. To this end, first we will solve each inequality separately.\nBegin by solving $54p-144\\leq0$, by adding 144 to each side, and then dividing each side by 54: \\begin{align*}\n54p&\\leq144\\\\\np&\\leq144/54=\\boxed{8/3}\n\\end{align*}\nNow solve $12-20p>0$. Add $20p$ to both sides and divide both sides by 20 to obtain: \\begin{align*}\n12&>20p\\\\\n6/10&>p\n\\end{align*}\nTherefore, the set of all $p$ that satisfy both inequalities is \\[\\boxed{(-\\infty,8/3].}\\]\n### Additional Note:  Final solution and/or any leftover questions can be added into the last part of the response.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is (-\\infty,\\frac{8}{3}] is the correct solution.\nFinal Partial: Final answer obtained from performing the logical application of the problem.

I can also provide more challenging tasks for advanced learners to ensure that their skills and knowledge are pushed to the next level.",
        " For the inequality $0\\ge 54p-144$, we can add 144 to both sides to get $144\\ge 54p$. Then we divide both sides by 54, and get $p\\le\\frac{144}{54}=8/3$.  For the other inequality, we add $p$ to both sides to get $12>20p$, which is the same as $0.6> p$.\nWe need to find all $p$ that satisfy both of these inequalities.  Clearly all $p$ that are $\\le 8/3$ will satisfy the first one.  However, we need those $p$ that are less than $0.6$ will also satisfy the second one.  Therefore, we have the overlap of the two intervals $[0,8/3]$ and $[0,0.6]$, so the answer is $\\boxed{[0,0.6]}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is [0,0.6]. I hope it is correct.

Since $p=0.1$ satisfies both inequalities, the answer is correct.  This reinforces our solution.\\\\\nFinal Answer: The final answer is [0,0.6]. I hope it is correct.
