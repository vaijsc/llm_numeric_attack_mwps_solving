        " The minimum value of $x^2 \u2013 14x + 3$ will be given by the value of $x$ that minimizes $x^2 \u2013 14x + 3$, which means $x^2 \u2013 14x + 3 = 0$. We need to find the minimum value of $x$ by solving $x^2 \u2013 14x + 3 = 0$.\nWe can solve this by completing the square:\n$$x^2-14x+3=0\\Rightarrow (x-7)^2-49+3=0\\Rightarrow (x-7)^2-46=0\\Rightarrow (x-7)^2=46.$$\nFrom $\\left(x-7\\right)^2=46$, $x$ must be equal to $7+\\sqrt{46}$ or $7-\\sqrt{46}$. Because $46>0$, $x$ cannot be $7+\\sqrt{46}$, so the minimum value of $x$ must be $\\boxed{7-\\sqrt{46}}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 7 - \\sqrt{46}. I hope it is correct.  Indeed, the key assistant shares it: [Instructor] The minimum value of $x$ that minimizes $x^2 \u2013 14x + 3$ will be given by $x^2 \u2013 14x + 3 = 0$. Therefore, we need to find the minimum value of $x$ by solving $x^2 \u2013 14x + 3 = 0$. Completing the square gives us $(x-7)^2-49+3=0$, which simplifies to $(x-7)^2-46=0$. Then, we obtain $(x-7)^2=46$. Since 46 is a positive number, we cannot have $x=7+\\sqrt{46}$, so $x=7-\\sqrt{46}$.\nThe minimum value of the quadratic function will occur when its derivative is equal to zero:\n$$f(x)=x^2-14x+3\\Rightarrow f'(x)=2x-14.$$\nSet $f'(x)=0$, we have $2x-14=0$, which is equivalent to $x=\\frac{14}{2}=7$.  In this case, the function is concave downwards.\nFor $x<7$, the function has negative second derivative.\nFor $x>7$, the function",

I hope it is correct. Show Solution $f(x) = x^2 -14x + 3$ is a quadratic function in $x$ and can be written in the form $f(x) = (x-a)^2 +b$ for some numbers $a$ and $b$. To minimize $f(x)$, we need to minimize $(x-a)^2$. The value of $x$ that minimizes $(x-a)^2$ is $x=a$. Therefore, we need to find $a$ by equating $f'(x) = 0$ and solving for $x$: \\begin{align*} f'(x) &= 2x -14 = 0\\\\ 2x &= 14\\\\ x &= 7 \\end{align*} Hence, the value of $x$ that will give the minimum value is $x = \\boxed{7}$.

The graph of the given quadratic expression is a parabola with a vertex at $(7,-46).$\nNow, we have the vertex form for a parabola with $a>0.$ The graph of $y = a(x-h)^2 + k$ opens upward and has a minimum at $(h,k).$ Our parabola in the vertex form is $y=(x-7)^2-46.$ The vertex form tells us where the vertex or $x$-coordinate is seen, where this is $h = 7.$ Therefore, we know that the value is indeed $x = \\boxed{7}.$\nTaking the second derivative of $y = x^2-14x+3$ gives $$y''=2>0,$$ revealing that the given parabola is concave upward. The value $x = 7$ is found by taking the first derivative and setting it to zero, since the",
