The final answer is supposed to include a brief explanation or a step-by-step solution, but unfortunately, I missed that part. I will make sure to include it next time. Thank you for bringing it up. \nThank you, and I am happy to help you. Let me break it down step by step. \nFirst, let\u2019s think about what $\\lceil x\\rceil$ and $\\lfloor x\\rfloor$ represent. $\\lceil x\\rceil$ represents the smallest integer greater than $x$, and $\\lfloor x\\rfloor$ represents the greatest integer less than $x$. For example, $\\lceil 3.1\\rceil = 4$ and $\\lfloor 3.1\\rceil = 3$.\nGiven the information in the problem, we know that $\\lceil x\\rceil+\\lfloor x\\rfloor+x=4.8$. This means that we can think of $x$ as being between $\\lfloor x\\rfloor$ and $\\lceil x\\rceil$, because if we add the two together, we can distribute it with $x$ like: $\\lceil x\\rceil+\\lfloor x\\rfloor+x=(\\lfloor x\\rfloor+1)+(\\lfloor x\\rfloor+x)$\nNow we can simplify this by writing the $\\lfloor x\\rfloor$ inside the parenthesis and then combining them. $(x)+(\\lfloor x\\rfloor)+1=4.8$ Next, we need to get rid of the $1$ that we added. We can do this by subtracting $1$ from both sides: $(x)+(\\lfloor x\\rfloor)=3.8$\nNow we have an expression that we can use to solve for $x$. However, $\\lfloor x\\rfloor$ is the greatest integer less than our unknown $x$. Let\u2019s write it as $n$ where $n$ is an integer. So, we have: $(n+x)=3.8$\nThe last step is to isolate the $x$ and we get: $x=3.8-n$. This",
        " If $\\lceil x\\rceil+\\lfloor x\\rfloor+x=4.8$, solve for x.\nWe know that $\\lceil x\\rceil$ is the smallest integer greater than or equal to $x$.

This inequality implies that $\\lfloor x\\rfloor + x<\\lfloor x\\rfloor + \\lceil x\\rceil = \\lfloor x\\rfloor + x + \\lceil x-\\lfloor x\\rfloor\\rceil = \\lceil x\\rceil + \\lfloor x\\rfloor + x$.\nIn this case, $\\lceil x\\rceil + \\lfloor x\\rfloor + x = 4.8$.
