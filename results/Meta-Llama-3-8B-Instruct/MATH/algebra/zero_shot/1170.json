        " \nLet's solve the system. We will use the method of elimination, where we use the first equation to express one variable in terms of another, and then we substitute that into the second equation to eliminate one variable. Let's start with the left-hand side of the first equation; we can rewrite it as $y-4x-2z=7$.\nNow, let's multiply the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 1, so that when we add, the $x$'s cancel out: \\begin{align*}\n12x-3y+6z&=21,\\\\\n6x+3y+3z&=5.\n\\end{align*}Now we can add the equations together: $$(12x-3y+6z)+(6x+3y+3z)=21+5\\Rightarrow12x+9z=26.$$Now we can solve for $z$: $$z=\\frac{26-12x}{9}.$$Now, let's substitute this into the original second equation to express $y$ in terms of $x$:\n\\begin{align*}\n6x+3y+3\\cdot\\frac{26-12x}{9}&=5\\\\\n6x+3y+\\frac{26-12x}{3}&=5\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 18x+9y+26-12x&=15\\\\\n6x+9y+26&=15\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad y&=\\frac{15-6x-26}{9}\\\\\n&=\\boxed{-\\frac{x+1}{3}}.\n\\end{align*}\n### Solution: \nThe final answer is \\boxed{-\\frac{x+1}{3}}. I hope it is correct. Let me know if you have any doubt or need further clarification.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -\\frac{x+1}{3}. I hope it is correct. Let me know if you have any doubt or need further clarification. ### Solution: \nThe final answer is -\\frac{x+1}{3}. I hope it is correct.

        " Let us play with the given equations. Add $3$ times the first equation to the second equation. We have\n$$10x+0y+6z=26.$$Now, use the fact that\n$$4x-y+2z=7.$$We can write\n$$y = (4x-7) + 2z.$$Plug this value of $y$ into the third equation. We get\n\\begin{align*}\n6x+3((4x-7)+2z)+3z&=5\\\\\n6x+12x-21+6z+9z&=5\\\\\n18x+15z&=26\\\\\nx&=\\frac{26-15z}{18}.\n\\end{align*}Substitute this back to $y=(4x-7)+2z$. We have\\begin{align*}\ny&=4(\\frac{26-15z}{18})-7+2z\\\\\ny&=\\frac{52-60z}{18}-7+2z\\\\\ny&=\\frac{52-60z+36-2z}{18}\\\\\ny&=\\frac{88-62z}{18}.\n\\end{align*}It is also feasible to leave the solution as $\\frac{88-62z}{18}$ since the given problem doesn\u2019t require a direct value for $y$. We can also deduce that $z=\\frac{10-3x}{3}$, but it is unnecessary to solve for $z$ as well.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\frac{88-62z}{18}.
