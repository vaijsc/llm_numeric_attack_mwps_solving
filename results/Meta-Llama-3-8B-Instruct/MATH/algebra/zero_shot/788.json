Note that for such $x$, we also have $1-\\sqrt{2-\\sqrt{x}}\\leq2$, so it must be that $x\\leq2^2=4$.  We now show that these inequalities are sharp.

        " The domain of $f$ is $\\boxed{[0,4]}$.\nWe know that the square root is only defined when its argument is non-negative.  This means we must have $$1-\\sqrt{2-\\sqrt{x}}\\ge0.$$  Solving for $\\sqrt{x}$ we find $$\\sqrt{x}\\le2-1=1,$$so $\\sqrt{x}\\in[0,1]$.\nNext, we know that $2-\\sqrt{x}$ is only defined when its argument is non-negative, which means $$2-\\sqrt{x}\\ge0.$$  Solving for $\\sqrt{x}$, we find $$\\sqrt{x}\\le2$$and so $\\sqrt{x}\\in[0,4]$.  Now we have constraints on $\\sqrt{x}$.  Since $x$ must be non-negative, we also have $x\\ge0$.\nNow we have three constraints: $\\sqrt{x}\\in[0,1]$; $\\sqrt{x}\\in[0,4]$; and $x\\ge0$.  The only values of $x$ that satisfy all three are $x\\in[0,4]$.  Hence, the domain of $f$ is the set $[0,4]$.  (Note: The question unfortunately didn\u2019t say that $f$ is a real-valued function.  If it were possible to take the square root of negative numbers, then some of these values of $x$ might yield an extension of the function.  However, since $f$ is indeed a real-valued function, its domain has been correctly identified.)\nFinal Answer: The final answer is [0,4]. I hope it is correct. - ### ",
        " The domain of $f(x) = \\sqrt{1-\\sqrt{2-\\sqrt{x}}}$ is $\\boxed{[0,4]}$.\nTo start, we need to know that the input $x$ to $\\sqrt{x}$ is non-negative. Extending the domain of the square root to negative real numbers would only make sense in certain contexts that are not relevant to this problem. So we know that $\\sqrt{x}\\ge 0$, and thus that $x\\ge0$.\nOur next concern is the function inside the first square root, $2-\\sqrt{x}$. We know that $\\sqrt{2-\\sqrt{x}}\\ge0$, so $2-\\sqrt{x}\\ge0$, and thus that $\\sqrt{x}\\le2$. So the input to the innermost square root, $x$, is at most 4.\nThus, the domain of $f$ is the set of $x\\in[0,4]$ such that $1-\\sqrt{2-\\sqrt{x}}\\ge0$, or equivalently such that $\\sqrt{2-\\sqrt{x}}\\le1$. Since $\\sqrt{2-\\sqrt{x}}\\ge0$, this inequality is equivalent to $\\sqrt{2-\\sqrt{x}}\\le1$, or equivalently to $2-\\sqrt{x}\\le1$. Before we proceed, let\u2019s think about what this inequality is saying: it is saying that the input to the original square root, $2-\\sqrt{x}$, is at most 1. The condition is the same condition we just derived about the input to the innermost square root, $x$, so this inequality simplifies down to $\\sqrt{x}\\le2$. We have already derived this constraint, so this doesn\u2019t add anything new to our domain.\nWe were left with the set of $x\\in[0,4]$ such that $1-\\sqrt{2-\\sqrt{x}}\\ge0$, or $\\sqrt{2-\\sqrt{x}}\\le1$. In equivalent form, this becomes $\\sqrt{2-\\sqrt{x}}\\ge-1$, which can be simplified down to $2-\\sqrt{x}\\ge1$, which is equivalent to $\\sqrt{x}\\le1$. This is impossible, since it would force the input $x$ to the innermost square root to be negative.\nThus, we have derived that the only values of $x$ such that $1-\\sqrt{2-\\sqrt{x}}\\ge0$ are the ones such",
        " \nIf $x$ is nonnegative, $f(x)$ is defined since $x$ and $2-\\sqrt{x}$ are nonnegative.  Since $1-\\sqrt{2-\\sqrt{x}}$ is nonnegative as well, $f(x)$ is defined for $x$ in $[0,4]$.\nNow we look at the other cases.\nIf $x>4$, $2-\\sqrt{x}<0$, so $\\sqrt{1-\\sqrt{2-\\sqrt{x}}}$ is not real-valued.  Therefore, $f(x)$ is not defined for $x>4$.\nAs for the case $x<0$, $f(x)$ is not defined when $x<0$ since the expression $1-\\sqrt{2-\\sqrt{x}}$ is negative, and the square root of a negative number is not real-valued.\nTherefore, the domain of $f$ is $\\boxed{[0,4]}$. The domain does not include the endpoints, $0$ and $4$, because those values of $x$ make some of the quantities appearing in the expressions negative, and the square root of a negative number is not real-valued.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is [0,4].

        " Let\u2019s break it down step by step.\nFirst, we need to make sure that $\\sqrt{x}\\leq2$, otherwise $\\sqrt{2-\\sqrt{x}}$ is undefined.  In other words, we require that $x\\leq4$.\nSecond, we need to make sure that $2-\\sqrt{x}\\geq 0$, otherwise $\\sqrt{1-\\sqrt{2-\\sqrt{x}}}$ is undefined.  In other words, we require that $\\sqrt{x}\\leq2$, which we already satisfied earlier.\nThird, we need to make sure that $1-\\sqrt{2-\\sqrt{x}}\\geq0$, otherwise $\\sqrt{1-\\sqrt{2-\\sqrt{x}}}$ is undefined.  In other words, we require that $2-\\sqrt{x}\\leq1$, which is equivalent to $\\sqrt{x}\\geq 1$.\nTherefore, the domain of the function $f$ is the set $\\boxed{\\{x|0\\leq x\\leq4\\}}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\{x|0\\leq x\\leq4\\}$. I hope it is correct.  Ascii\n<< Previous (Example 10 "
