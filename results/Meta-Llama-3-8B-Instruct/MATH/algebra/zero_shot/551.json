        " We know that the parabola has a vertical axis of symmetry.  Therefore, it must be symmetric with respect to the vertical line $x=2$.  In other words, the $x$-coordinate of any point on the graph can be represented as $x=2 + (x-2)$ for some value of $x-2$.  We also know that $(2,3)$ is the vertex of the parabola, and since $y=a(x-2)^2 + 3$ is the equation of a parabola with vertical axis of symmetry at $x=2$, we have that $a\\cdot (-2)^2 + 3=3$, so $a=0$, which means that $y=3$.\nWe also know that $(4,4)$ is a point on the graph.

Therefore, the $y$ must have a $y$-intercept at the point $(0,c)$ for some value of $c$.  Therefore, we take $c=3$ and solve for $a$ by using the fact that $(2,3)$ is the vertex.

We have $h=2$ and $k=3$, and the actual form of the function is $y=a(x-2)^2+3$.  This means that we have $2a+3 = 4$ which implies $a = 1$.\nThe function $y=x^2-2x+4$ goes through the point $(4,4)$, so plugging in $x=4$ and $y=4$, we get $4 = 4-8+4$ which is indeed true.  Thus, we know that this function $y=x^2-2x+4$ is the correct function.\nNow, if we want to find the value of the function at $x=6$, we can simply plug in $x=6$ to obtain $y = 6^2-2(6)+4 = \\boxed{8}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 8.

        " First, we will find the equation of the parabola.\nGiven $y=ax^2 + bx + c$. We are told that the vertex of this parabola is $(2,3)$, so $a(2)^2+b(2)+c=3$. Simplifying this equation, we have \\begin{align*} 4a + 2b + c &= 3\\\\\n\\end{align*} To write the equation of a parabola, we need the center and another point on it. We are also given that the parabola contains the point $(4,4)$. Plugging this into the equation $y=ax^2 + bx + c$, we get $a(4)^2+b(4)+c=4$. Simplifying this equation, we have\n\\begin{align*}\n16a + 4b + c &= 4\\\\\n\\end{align*}\nWe now have two equations and we can start solving for $a, b,$ and $c$.\n### From here, we can solve for $a,$ $b,$ and $c$.\nSubtract the first equation from the second one to get rid of $c$.

By adding $3$ to both sides, we have $4a + 2b = 6$.\n### Putting everything together\nWe have the following:\n\\begin{align*}\n6a+b &= \\frac{1}{2}\\\\\n4a + 2",

Since it is symmetric across the vertical line $x=2$, we know that the other point on the parabola (that is, symmetric across) is at $(4,3)$, because we know that $(2,3)$ is the vertex.\n### Because $(4,3)$ is also on the parabola, we now know the quadratic equation that describes the parabola can take the following form:\n$$y=ax^2+bx+c$$ where we also know that \\begin{align*} ax^2+bx+c&=3 \\quad (2)\\\\\n&=3 \\quad (4)\n\\end{align*} because $(2,3)$ and $(4,3)$ are on the parabola.  To determine the quadratic equation for this parabola, we can plug $(4,3)$ into the equation. Since we know that $(4,3)$ is on the parabola, we can set $(x,y)=(4,3)$ and solve for $a,b,c$.  Thus,\n\\begin{align*}\na\\cdot4^2+b\\cdot4+c&=3\\\\\n16a+4b+c&=3\n\\end{align*}  Now that we know that $(4,3)$ is on the parabola, we can plug $(4,4)$ into the equation to determine $a,b,c$ so that we can do the same as above:\n\\begin{align*}\na\\cdot4^2+b\\cdot4+c&=4\\\\\n16a+4b+c&=4\n\\end{align*}  We have two equations with three unknowns so we get a system of linear equations: \\begin{align*}\n16a+4b+c&=3\\\\\n16a+4b+c&=4\n\\end{align*} The system of equations above implies that $c=1$ by subtracting both sides by $16a+4b+1$ and then noting that it is a system of linear equations that has a no solution (it is",

So $h = 2$ and $k = 3.$  The general form of the parabola $y = ax^2 +bx +c$ is related to the vertex form by $$y = a(x^2-2hx+h^2) + (k-c) = a(x^2 -2hx +h^2) + k.$$Here $-2ah = b$ and $ah^2 +k-c = c.$  So in this case, $b = -4a$ and $4a + 3 -c = 0$ or $c = 4a+3.$  Using the point $(4,4),$ we can substitute the point into the parabola equation in general form $$4 = a(4^2-8(2)+4) + 4a+3$$Simplifying further, $$1 = 16a - 16 + 4a + 3$$Simplifying again, $$4 = 20a$$ Solving for $a$, $$a = \\frac{2}{5}.$$Using the relation $c = 4a+3,$ we have $$c = 4 \\left(\\frac{2}{5}\\right) + 3 = \\frac{8}{5} + 3 = \\frac{18}{5}.$$The equation $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ is $$y = \\frac{2}{5}x^2 - \\frac{4}{5}x + \\frac{18}{5}.$$Now let\u2019s compute $y$ for $x=6$:  $$y = \\frac{2}{5}(6^2) - \\frac{4}{5}(6) + \\frac{18}{5} = \\frac{2\\cdot36}{5} - \\frac{4\\cdot 6}{5} + \\frac{18}{5} = \\frac{72}{5} - \\frac{24}{5} + \\frac{18}{5} = \\frac{66}{5} = \\boxed{\\frac{66}{5}}.$$",

Since we know the equation of the parabola vertex is given by $y = a(2)^2 - 4a(2) + 4$, we can solve to find the value of $a$:\n4 = 4a - 8a + 4 \\Rightarrow 4 = -4a + 4 \\Rightarrow 0 = -4a \\Rightarrow a = \\frac{1}{2}.\nHence, our parabola equation is y = \\frac{1}{2}x^2 - 2x + 4.\nFinally, to find the value of $y$ when $x = 6$, we can just substitute:\ny = \\frac{1}{2}(6)^2 - 2(6) + 4 = \\boxed{2}.\nSo, the value of $y$ when $x = 6$ is 2.

We also know that the point $(4,4)$ is on the graph of the parabola.  So we have $4 = a(4)^2 + b(4) + c$, which simplifies to $4 = 16a + 4b + c$.\n3. Let\u2019s substitute $3=4a + 2b + c$ into $4 = 16a + 4b + c$.  We get $4 = 16a + 4b + 4a + 2b$, which simplifies to $0 = 12a$.  Therefore, $a = 0$.\n4.

Therefore, we have $c = 3 - 2(1) = 1$.\n5. Since we know that the value of $a$ is $0$, we can simplify $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ to $y = bx + c$, which is $y = x + 1$.\n6.

The midpoint of any parabola with equation $y=f(x)$ is $\\left(\\frac{-b}{2a},f\\left(\\frac{-b}{2a}\\right)\\right)$.\nAs we discussed, we can write the parabola as\n\\begin{align*}\ny &= a(x-2)^2 + 3\\\\\n\\text{and }x&=2 \\Rightarrow \\frac{-b}{2a}=2 \\Rightarrow b = -4a\\\\\n\\text{also }y &= 3 \\Rightarrow y-f\\left(\\frac{-b}{2a}\\right) = 3-f\\left(\\frac{-b}{2a}\\right)\\\\\n0&=3-f\\left(\\frac{-b}{2a}\\right)\\\\\nf\\left(\\frac{-b}{2a}\\right)&=3\\\\\ny&=4\\ \\text{(by the info in the question}\\ \\'s first sentence)\n\\end{align*}\nWe can use the info from the point $(2,3)$ first. By the product of the father and mother (x coordinates of the given vertex) and the coefficient of the mother (x-squared term) are 0:\n$$6a+b = 0$$\nThen we plug that into $(4,4)$ to get\n$$4a+4 = 4$$\n$$4a=0 \\Rightarrow a = 0 \\Rightarrow b = 0$$\nThis removes all curve and turns it into a straight line where $y = 3$. And that\nWe are ready for the last step:\n$$y=a(x-2)^2+3$$\nNow: $$a(x-2)^2\\ =\\ 0$$ Then $y\\ =\\ 3$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is y = 3. I hope it is correct. 4\nFinal Answer: The final answer is y=3.",
        " We first use the information that the parabola is symmetric about a vertical line to find the $x$-intercept of the parabola.  For that to happen, there must be an $x$-intercept between $2$ and $4$, since the $x$-intercept of the parabola is also the $x$-coordinate of the vertex.\nLet the $x$-intercept be $\\ell$.  Substituting $\\ell$ for $x$ and $0$ for $y$ in the equation $y=ax^2 + bx + c$, we have $0 = a \\ell^2 + \\ell b + c$.  Substituting in $2$ for $x$ and $3$ for $y$ in the same equation, we have $3 = a \\cdot 2^2 + 2 b + c$.  Subtracting the first equation from this one, we have $3 = a \\ell^2 + 2 \\ell b - a 2^2 - 2 b + c - c = a (\\ell^2 - 4\\ell) = a (\\ell^2 - 4 \\ell+4 - 4) = a(\\ell-2)^2 - 4a$.\nSince $\\ell$ is a real number and we have thus expressed $3$ as a function of $\\ell-2$, we know that the real value we must find is $\\ell-2=0$, so $\\ell=2$.  Hence, we know that the parabola contains the points $(2,3)$ and $(4,4)$, so the parabola does pass through the point $(4,4)$.  Hence, substituting $4$ into both $x$ and $y$, we get\n$$4=a\\cdot4^2+4b+c,$$and have\n\\begin{align*}\n4&=16a+4b+c,\\\\\nc&=4-16a-4b.\n\\end{align*}Substituting $c$ into the equation of the parabola, we have\n$$y=(a)(x)^2+(b)(x)+[(4-16a-4b)].$$So $(2,3)$ still satisfies the equation.  Simplifying the equation, we get\n$$y=a(x-2)^2+3.$$Therefore, we find\n$$4=a(4-"
