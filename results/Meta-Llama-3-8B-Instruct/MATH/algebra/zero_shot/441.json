        " We have equations $3n+m=14$ and $n+m=1$. Let us solve first $n+m=1$ and then use this to find $n-m$.\n#### Step 1: Solving $n+m=1$.\nBy subtracting both $n$ and $m$ at both sides of the equation $n+m=1$, we get $n+m- (n+m) = 1- (n+m)$ which simplifies to $0=n+m-1$ which further simplifies to $-m=n-1$. Now we replace $n$ with $1-m$ into equation $n+m=1$ to get $1-m+m=1$. Simplifying left hand side of the equation, we have $1=m$. Therefore $n=1-m$ $\\implies$ $n=1-1$ $\\implies$ $n=0$.\n#### Step 2: Using $n=0$ to find $n-m$.\nWe now know that $n=0$. We can now find $n-m$ by replacing $n$ in $n-m$ by $0$ $\\implies$ $n-m=0-m$ $\\implies$ $m-m$. So finally $n-m=\\boxed{0}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 0. I hope it is correct.

It is crucial that students follow the instructions carefully throughout the entire problem-solving process. The instructor's goal is to guide students through the problem-solving process and ensure they understand the steps involved. The example provided in the instruction demonstrates the importance of clear instructions and careful follow-up. In this instance, the student is expected to follow a step-by-step approach to solve the system of equations and find the value of $n-m$.\n=====\n=====\n=====\nI am here to help you with your question! To find the value of $n-m$, we need to solve the system of equations consisting of $3n+m=14$ and $n+m=1$.\nStep 1: Solve the equation $n+m=1$ for $m$. We have $m=1-n$.\nStep 2: Substitute the expression for $m$ into the equation $3n+m=14$. We get $3n+(1-n)=14$. Simplify the equation by combining like terms: $2n=13$.\nStep 3: Solve for $n$:",

First, solve the system of equations given by\n\\begin{align*}\n3n+m&=14\\tag{1},\\\\\nn+m&=1\\tag{2}\n\\end{align*}by solving the first equation for $m$ in (2), to obtain$$m=14-3n\\tag{3}.$$Replace the value in (2) with the value in (3) to obtain$$n+14-3n=1\\Rightarrow-2n=-13\\Rightarrow n=13/2,$$so\n$$m=14-3(13/2)=14-39/2=-25/2.$$Taking the difference of $n$ and $m$ yields$$n-m=13/2-(-25/2)=\\boxed{19/2}.$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 19/2.

        " [Show Answer]\nThe first step is to recognize that we have a system of two linear equations:\n\\begin{align*}\n3n+m&=14,\\\\\nn+m&=1.\n\\end{align*}We can try to solve this system by elimination.  Multiplying the second equation by 3, we find \\begin{align*}\n3n+m&=14,\\\\\n3n+3m&=3,\\\\\n\\hline\n6n+4m&=17.\n\\end{align*}Now we can subtract the first equation from this equation to write $m=17-14=\\boxed{3}$.\nSubstituting $m=3$ into $n+m=1$, we can solve for $n$: \\begin{align*}\nn+3&=1\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=-2.\n\\end{align*}Hence, $n-m=-2-3=-5$, so the value of $n-m$ is $\\boxed{-5}$.\n### Explanatory Answer:\nThe idea is to use substitution or elimination to solve the system.  Since the solutions are integers, it\u2019s a good idea to use elimination.  We first multiply the second equation by 3 to get $3n+3m=3$, and then add the equations to eliminate the $m$ term.  The $3n$ terms add, and we have \\begin{align*}\n6n+4m&=17\\\\\n&\\Rightarrow\\qquad 6n+3n+4m=17+3\\\\\n&\\Rightarrow\\qquad 9n+4m=20.\n\\end{align*}We now substitute $3$ for $m$ (which gives $3n=7$, so $n=7/3$), but it is easier to simplify now.  We can simply substitute $m=3$ into the second equation to solve for $n$:  $$n+3=1\\Rightarrow n=-2.$$Finally, we find $n-m=-2-3=-5.$\nEither way, we need to be careful to use integers when possible.  For instance, we can find $n$ and $m$ as above, and then find that $n-m=-2-3=-5.$\n### WARNING: Avoid calculating 3n+3m=3 as $(3n+m)\\cdot 3=3$",
