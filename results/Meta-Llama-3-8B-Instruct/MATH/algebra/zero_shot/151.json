These values are  roots of the quadratic equation $2x^2-7x+2=0$.  Now, since $a=1$ and $a=5$ are roots of the quadratic equation, then there will be an equivalent equation which we can write following the formula of quadratic equations. Now, $a=1$, $b=1/1$, $c=2$. So, replacing in formula, we will obtain the following result:  Now, we have $a+2=1$.

In the first case, we conclude that $a$ or $b$ cannot be zero or negative (otherwise $a+b$ would be undefined or negative).

Thus, we can write\n$$-2(a+b)=-7\\Leftrightarrow a+b=\\frac{7}{2}\\Leftrightarrow a=7/2-b.$$Now we have two cases to discuss.\n\\textbf{Case 1: } $a$ positive. Since $a>0$, we have $7/2-b>0$, and we know $b=1/a>0$, so we have $7/a>1$ or $a<7$.  Also, since $a+b=7/2>0$, we have $b>-(7/2)$, so $a=(7/2)-b>-b$.  Therefore, $b<a<7$.  We know $b=1/a$, so $1/a<a$, which implies $a>1$.\nIn order to find $a-1$ and $b-1$, we have to"
