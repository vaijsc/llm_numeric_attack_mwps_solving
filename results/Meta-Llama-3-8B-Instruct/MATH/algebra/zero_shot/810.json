        "To find the radius of the circle given by the equation \\(x^2 - 4x + y^2 - 6y - 36 = 0\\), we can start by rewriting the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \\((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\\), where \\((h, k)\\) is the center of the circle and \\(r\\) is the radius.\nFirst, we need to rearrange the given equation: \n\\[\nx^2 - 4x + y^2 - 6y = 36\n\\]\nNext, we complete the square for the \\(x\\) terms and the \\(y\\) terms separately.\nStarting with the \\(x\\) terms: \n\\[\nx^2 - 4x\n\\]\nTo complete the square, take half of the coefficient of \\(x\\) (which is \\(-4\\)), square it, and add it inside the square (while subtracting it outside to keep the equation balanced):\n\\[\n\\left(-\\frac{4}{2}\\right)^2 = 4 \\implies x^2 - 4x + 4\n\\]\nThis gives us:\n\\[\n(x - 2)^2\n\\]\nNow for the \\(y\\) terms:\n\\[\ny^2 - 6y\n\\]\nAgain, take half of the coefficient of \\(y\\) (which is \\(-6\\)), square it, and add it inside the square (and balance the equation by subtracting it):\n\\[\n\\left(-\\frac{6}{2}\\right)^2 = 9 \\implies y^2 - 6y + 9\n\\]\nThis results in:\n\\[\n(y - 3)^2\n\\]\nNow add \\(4\\) and \\(9\\) to both sides of the equation:\n\\[\n(x - 2)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 36 + 4 + 9\n\\]\nCombine the numbers on the right side:\n\\[\n36 + 4 + 9 = 49\n\\]\nSo we have:\n\\[\n(x - 2)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 49\n\\]\nThis is now in the standard form of a circle's equation:\n\\[\n(x - 2)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 7^2\n\\]\nFrom this, we can see that the radius \\(r\\) of the circle is \\(7\\).\nThus, the radius of the circle is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{7}\n\\]",

        " $r = \\boxed{3}$\nLet the center of the circle be $(a,b)$, so that $x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 = r^2$. So, compare the two equations. To get rid of the $x^2$ term, we need $a = 2$. Similarly, we need $b = 3$ to get rid of the $y^2$ term. Then, we can compare the $xy$ terms: $-4(a) + 6(b) = 0$ so $-4 \\cdot 2 + 6 \\cdot 3 = 0$ (True). So, this equality gives $-4a + 6b = 0$. We compare the free term to get $a^2 + b^2 = 36$, so we get $(-2)^2 + 3^2 = 4 + 9 = 13$. This equality is not true. Therefore, we cannot complete the square, which means the equation is not of the form $x^2 + y^2 - 2rx - 2sy + c$.\nHowever, we can try to complete the square of just one of the squared terms. Let\u2019s complete the $x^2$ term. Adding $(4)^2 = 16$ to both sides of $x^2 - 4x + y^2 - 6y - 36 = 0$, we get $(x - 2)^2 = 16 - 36 = -20$, which is not true. Therefore, we cannot complete the square. So, we cannot write the equation in the form $x^2 + y^2 - 2rx - 2sy + c$, from which we cannot get to the form $(x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 = r^2$, so we cannot find the radius $r$.\nHowever, we can see that the given equation is a perfect square, so if we add $(2)^2 + (3)^2 = 13$ to both sides of the equation, we get $0 = 4 + 9 - 36 = (x - 2)^2 + (y - 3)^2 - (3)^2$, which is indeed of the form $(x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 = r^2$! Therefore, $r = \\boxed{3}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is",
        " First, we are looking at the equation of a circle. The general form for an equation of a circle with center (h, k) and radius r is $(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$. In our case, if we complete the square, we can put our equation in the form $(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$: \\begin{align*} x^2 - 4x + y^2 - 6y - 36 &= 0\\\\ x^2 - 4x + 4 + y^2 - 6y + 9 &= 4 + 9 - 36\\\\ (x - 2)^2 + (y - 3)^2 &= -23 \\end{align*} Unfortunately, we have a negative term on the right side of the equation rather than 0. So, $(x - 2)^2 + (y - 3)^2 \\neq r^2$. To fix this, we can take the absolute value of the right side to make it non-negative: \\begin{align*} (x - 2)^2 + (y - 3)^2 &= | -23 |\\\\ (x - 2)^2 + (y - 3)^2 &= 23 \\end{align*} Now, we are almost there. To find the radius $r$, we need to get the two solutions back together. So, let\u2019s take the square root of both sides: $r = \\boxed{\\sqrt{23}}$.  Final Answer: The final answer is \\sqrt{23}. I hope it is correct.  Our equation is now in the form $(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle. This is because we have $(x - 2)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 23$, which means that $r = \\sqrt{23}$.
