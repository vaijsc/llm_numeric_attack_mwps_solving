        " My answer is $\\boxed{3}$. Explanation: First, let\u2019s find $\\sqrt{27}$. Using a calculator, we get $\\sqrt{27} \\approx 5.196$. Since this number is greater than 5, the smallest integer greater than $\\sqrt{27}$ is 6. Therefore, $\\left\\lceil\\sqrt{27}\\right\\rceil = 6$. Next, let\u2019s find $\\sqrt{26}$. Using a calculator, we get $\\sqrt{26} \\approx 5.099$. Since this number is less than 5, the greatest integer less than $\\sqrt{26}$ is 5. Therefore, $\\left\\lfloor\\sqrt{26}\\right\\rfloor = 5$.\nNow, we can calculate the sum $6 - 5 = 1$. Therefore, we have $\\boxed{\\left\\lceil\\sqrt{27}\\right\\rceil - \\left\\lfloor\\sqrt{26}\\right\\rfloor = 1}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 1. I hope it is correct.",

Hence, the ceiling function evaluates to 4.\nNext, we calculate 26\u2019s square root. \n$\\sqrt{26}$ = $\\sqrt{25\\cdot \\frac{26}{25}}$ = $\\sqrt{25}\\sqrt{\\frac{26}{25}}$ = $5\\sqrt{\\frac{26}{25}}$. Since $5^2\\cdot\\frac{26}{25}$ = 26 is slightly less than 27, the floor function will give 5.\nTo proceed, we have 4 - 5 = -1 as our answer. However, according to the rules of the problem, the output should be a non-negative value.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 0. I hope it is correct.

Since 5^2=25 and 6^2=36, we have \\sqrt{26} between 5 and 6.  Hence $\\left\\lfloor\\sqrt{26}\\right\\rfloor = \\boxed{5}$.\nNow the answer is $5-5=\\boxed{0}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 0. I hope it is correct. ### I'm confused. Why can't we just evaluate these fractional values for $\\sqrt{27}$ and $\\sqrt{26}$ instead of finding the nearest integers?\nWe can evaluate these fractional values, but we have to pay attention to the definitions of the ceiling and floor functions. The ceiling function $\\lceil x\\rceil$ is defined to be the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to $x$, and the floor function $\\lfloor x\\rfloor$ is defined to be the largest integer that is less than or equal to $x$. In this problem, we have \\sqrt{27}=3\\sqrt{3} \\approx 5.196. Since $5.196 > 5$, the closest integer that is greater than or equal to $5.196$ is $\\boxed{5}$, so $\\lceil \\sqrt{27} \\rceil = \\boxed{5}$. On the other hand, we have \\sqrt{26} \\approx 5.099, so the largest integer that is less than or equal to $5.099$ is $\\boxed{5}$, so $\\lfloor \\sqrt{26} \\rfloor = \\boxed{5}$. Therefore, the difference between the ceiling of $\\sqrt{27}$ and the floor of $\\sqrt{26}$ is $\\boxed{5-5=0}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 0.
