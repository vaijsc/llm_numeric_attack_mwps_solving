Also, $i^4=1$ and $i^3=i\\cdot i^2=i$, so $i^4=1$, $i^5=i$, $i^6=i^2$, and $i^8=1$.\nSo, $i+i^2+i^3+\\cdots+i^{258}+i^{259} = i+i^2+i^3+\\cdots+i^{4\\cdot64\\cdot2}+i^{4\\cdot64\\cdot2+3}$, which is a geometric progression with a first term $a=i$, a common ratio $r=i^4=1$, and $n=4\\cdot64\\cdot2 + 1 = 257$. But the last term is $i^3$, so we have\n$$i+i^2+i^3+\\cdots+i^{258}+i^{259} = \\frac{i\\cdot(1-1^{258})}{1-1}=\\boxed{-i}$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -i. I hope it is correct.  <<problem generation>> 2652\n \u4e00\u822c\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u4ed6\u8981\u6c42\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6b21\u5e42\u7684\u548c\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a4\u6b21\u5e42\u7684\u548c\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u9664\u4ee54\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u6700\u540e\u6210\u4e3a\u7b2c\u4e00\u5e42\u7684\u548c\uff0c\u5373\u53ef\u7b80\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002\u5982\u4e0a\u9762\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u770b\u5230\u4ed6\u6700\u540e\u51fa\u6765\u7684\u5e42\u6b21\u1ed1n\u4e3a4\u7684\u5e42\u6b21\u5e42\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e2a\u548c\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a4\u6b21\u5e42\u7684\u548c\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u9664\u4ee54\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u53ef\u4ee5\u7b80\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002 <<Math Jumble>> 2652 <<\u4e00\u6a21\u4e00elerini>> 2652 Problem 2652 Strange is to post multiple posts and spread them out. <<Yueluxi>> 2652 Problem 2652 Geometry fran\u00e7ais, euclidien.
