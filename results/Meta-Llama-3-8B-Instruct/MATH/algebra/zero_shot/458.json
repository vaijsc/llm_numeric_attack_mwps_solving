The range of integers for the first sum was 0-100, and the range of integers for the second sum was 100-200. In solving the problem, the solution began by finding the total number of odd integers in each range of integers. It then found the sum of the odd integers in each range and finally calculated the ratio of these sums. The ratio turned out to be 1, meaning that the sum of the odd integers between 0 and 100 and the sum of the odd integers between 100 and 200 are equal.  #### Final Example: How many odd integers are there in the range 2-19?

        " The odd integers from 0 to 100 are 1 + 3 + 5 + 7\u2026+ 99. The odd integers from 100 to 200 are 101 + 103 + 105 + 107\u2026 + 199. The denominator of both sums is the same. It is 100.\n### Final Answer: Therefore, the ratio of the sum of the sum of the odd integers between 0 and 100, to the sum of the odd integers between 100 and 200, is \\(\\frac{sum} {sum}\\). 100/100, which is 1.\tSo, the answer is 1. 1. 1.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 1.

Sum of odd integers between 0 and 100 divided by Sum of odd integers between 100 and 200 = 2,500/25,000 = 1/10 = 0.1.\n### Verification: CLICK Ellerton.?.Alana. \u00a0\u2019 2Sum problemsSum off integers(police . = &Prime SUM problem\nSum of odd integers between 0 and 100 is: \\(\\frac{100^2-1}{2}\\) = 2500Sum of odd integers between 100 and 200 is: \\(\\frac{200^2-1}{2}\\) = 25000Now we can find the ratio. The sum of odd integers between 0 and 100 divided by the sum of odd integers between 100 and 200 is 2500/25000 = 2.5/25 = 1/10 = 0.1.",

        " \nThe sum of the odd integers between 0 and 100 is $1+3+...+99.$ We can rewrite this as $1+(1+2)+(1+2+3)+...+(1+2+99),$ which yields $$1+(1+2)+(1+2+3)+...+(1+2+99)=\\frac{(1+2+3+...+99)+1+2+3+...+49}{2}=\\frac{10000}{2}=5000.$$Similarly, the sum of the odd integers between 100 and 200 is $101+103+...+199.$ This is equivalent to $101+(101+2)+(101+2+3)+...+(101+2+99),$ which is equal to $$101+(101+2)+(101+2+3)+...+(101+2+99)=\\frac{(101+2+3+...+199)+101+2+3+...+49}{2}=\\frac{20000}{2}=10000.$$Finally, the ratio of these two sums is $$\\frac{5000}{10000}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}.$$\n---\nNote:We can obtain the same result using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence.",

        " The sum of the odd integers from 1 to 100 is $\\frac{1}{2}\\left(1+100\\right)\\left(100\\right)=5000$. The sum of the odd integers from 101 to 200 is $\\frac{1}{2}\\left(101+200\\right)\\left(100\\right)=9900$. Hence, the ratio of the sum of the odd integers between 0 and 100, to the sum of the odd integers between 100 and 200 equals the quotient $\\frac{5000}{9900}=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{99}}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\frac{5}{99}.
