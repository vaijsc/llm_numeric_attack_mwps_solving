        " To answer this question, first we have to find out the sum of the set of four consecutive integer. Given information is that sum of four consecutive integer is 22. So the first thing to do is to find the four consecutive integer of which sum is 22. Since there are four consecutive integer, and sums of four consecutive integer is 22. So the four possible set of consecutive integer for the sum of 22 are can be {4, 5, 6, 7}, {5, 6, 7, 8}, {6, 7, 8, 9}, {7, 8, 9, 10}.

To find out the four integer of which each integer is increased by 2 and then multiplied by 20, since first integer is to increase by 2 and then multiplied by 20, then the number will be 20 * 6 = 120. Similarly, the second integer would be 20 * 7 = 140. Similarly, the third integer would be 20 * 8 = 160. Similarly, the fourth integer would be 20 * 9 = 180. Therefore, the sum of new set of integers after increasing each integer by 2 and then multiplied by 20 will be the sum of 120 + 140 + 160 + 180 = 600.

        " We start by considering the set of consecutive integers that we are given.  Since they have a sum of 22, we know that they must be {1,2,3,4}, as 1+2+3+4=10.  The next step is to increase each of these numbers by 2, resulting in the set {3,4,5,6}.  If each of these numbers is multiplied by 20, we will get {60,80,100,120}.  The sum of these numbers is 60+80+100+120=360.\n### Correct answer: 360\n### Explanation: The original numbers are consecutive so the first number is 1, and the last number is 4. The sum is 22, so the average of these two numbers is the middle number. We get $$\\frac{22 + (1 + 4)}{2}$$ This simplifies to\n$$\\frac{27}{2}$$\nWe take the fractional part of the last equation because we are not bothered with whole numbers. This results in 13.5.\nThe original group of numbers are {1, 2, 13.5, 4}. Multiplying each number by 20 gives {20, 40, 270, 80}. The sum of the new numbers is 20 + 40 + 270 + 80 = 390. We subtract 20 from each term to get {0, 20, 250, 60}.\nWe take the sum of these numbers to get 330. The numbers are all positive so we do not need to include the negative numbers in our solution.
