        "To factor the expression \\(32x^3 - 4x^2 + 20x\\), we will follow these steps:\n1. **Identify the greatest common factor (GCF)**: \n   We look for the GCF of the coefficients \\(32\\), \\(-4\\), and \\(20\\).

        " \nTo factor a trinomial, we need to find two binomials whose product is the given trinomial. For $32x^3-4x^2+20x$, we notice that if we let $\\mathbf{A}=32x^2-4x$, then we can write $32x^3-4x^2+20x=\\mathbf{A}x+20x$, so in order to factor $\\mathbf{A}x+20x$, we need to find $r$ and $s$ such that $\\mathbf{A}x+20x=(rx+s)x$.  Since $32x^2-4x$ is just $32x^2$ minus $4x$, we can see that $(8x-1)(4x)=32x^2-4x$, so we get $r=8$ and $s=-1$.  Thus, $\\mathbf{A}x+20x=(8x-1)x+20x=(8x^2-x+20x)=8x^2+19x$.  Combining $8x^2$ with $32x^2$, we get a sum of $(32+8)x^2=(40)x^2$, and combining $-x$ with $19x$, we get a sum of $18x$.  Thus, we have $$32x^3-4x^2+20x=(40x^2-4x^2)+18x=x(32x^2-4x)+18x.$$ Since $32x^2-4x=8x(4x-1)$, we can conclude that $$32x^3-4x^2+20x=x(8x(4x-1))+18x=\\boxed{(8x^2-1)x+18x}.$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is (8x^2-1)x+18x.

That leaves us with the polynomial 32x\u00b2 - 4x + 20. From here, we can notice that 4 is a common factor of all the terms, so we can factor it out to get 4(8x\u00b2 - x + 5). Note that 8x\u00b2 - x + 5 is a quadratic expression. We can factor it using the method of factoring quadratic expressions that have two distinct linear factors. The factors are non zeroexpressions of the form ax + b when the discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac) is positive and the original quadratic equation is the square of the product of these two linear factors. If we write 8x\u00b2 - x + 5 as a product of two quadratic factors ax + b, we get (8x + 1)(x - 5) = 8x\u00b2 + x - 5 = 8x\u00b2 - 20x + 5. We can rearrange the right hand side of the equation to get 8x\u00b2 - x + 5. Note",
