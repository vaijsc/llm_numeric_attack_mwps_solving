We can write the number as \\(-2+i\\sqrt{6}\\) (where i is the imaginary unit) and can find the floor using a calculator. Doing so, we find that the floor is approximately -2. So, $f(\\sqrt[3]{-8})=(-2)^2=4$. Now, let\u2019s find $f(-\\pi)$. \\begin{align*}f(-\\pi)=\\boxed{\\lceil-\\pi\\rceil^2=3^2=9.} \\end{align*}Let\u2019s find $f(\\sqrt{50})$ next. \\begin{align*}f(\\sqrt{50})=|\\lfloor\\sqrt{50}\\rfloor|=\\boxed{7.} \\end{align*}Finally, let\u2019s find $f\\left(\\frac{9}{2}\\right)$. \\begin{align*}f\\left(\\frac{9}{2}\\right)=|\\lfloor\\frac{9}{2}\\rfloor|=\\boxed{4.} \\end{align*}Our final answer is $f(\\sqrt[3]{-8})+f(-\\pi)+f(\\sqrt{50})+f\\left(\\frac{9}{2}\\right)=4+9+7+4=\\boxed{24}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 24. I hope it is correct. It was a fun Combinatorics Problem. If you want to know more, please check the Combinatorics Problems. Happy Problem Solving! . Thank you.\n Problem: [wiracocha] \nNaive Method (Too Inefficient)\n* It took too much time to solve this problem.\n* We can find the value of $\\lfloor\\sqrt[3]{-8}\\rfloor$ is -2, since the cube root of -8 is a non-real complex number, then the imaginary number has a coefficient $\\sqrt{6}$.\n* It took too much time to solve this problem where I got tired typing input.\nEnd.  And this is the Combinatorics Problems. I hope you enjoyed the problem-solving experience. Let\u2019s",
