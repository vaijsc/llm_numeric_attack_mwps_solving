We can also try to solve the equation by recognizing it as a polynomial with a sign change. Recall that a polynomial equation $p(x) = 0$ has a solution if and only if the graph of $y = p(x)$ crosses the $x$-axis. We are looking for all points $(x, 0)$ where the polynomial $f(x) = x^2 + |x|$ crosses the $x$-axis.\nBy looking at the graph, we can see that $f(x)$ crosses the $x$-axis at $x = 0$ and $x = -1$. Furthermore, we can use the Sign Change Theorem, which states that a polynomial equation has a solution if and only if the polynomial changes sign at that solution. Since $f(x)$ changes sign from positive to negative at $x = 0$ and from positive to negative at $x = -1$, the graph crosses the $x",

        " ### Hint: If the coefficient of the quadratic term were 1 instead of 1, the equation would have no solutions.  We can write $\\pmx$ instead of $|x|.$\n### Solution: ### To solve the equation, we must write the equation in the form $(x - a)(x - b) = 0$. We see that $(x \\pm x)(x - 0) = 0$, which gives $x = \\boxed{\\text{No solution.}}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is No solution. I hope it is correct.### Isn't he hoping I am getting rid of the absolute value. Well, it's true that we can factor it in that way. But Allison has told me that these questions must have at least one solution.  So let's try something else.\nInstead, let's use cases.  What about if $x > 0$? $$x^2 = -x\\\\x^2 + x = 0\\\\x(x + 1) = 0\\\\x = 0,\\ x = -1$$  There are two solutions for the case $x > 0$.\nWhat about if $x < 0$? $$x^2 = -x\\\\x^2 + x = 0\\\\x(x + 1) = 0\\\\x = 0,\\ x = -1$$  There are two solutions for the case $x < 0$.\nThere are no other cases.  Therefore, the answer is 2.  It is clearly not right.  I still feel that the problem was wrong, because the equation has no real solutions.",
        " Since ($x^2 > 0 \\implies -x^2 \\geq 0$), for all $x\\neq0, |x| = |x|$ and for $x=0, |x| = 0$.\nSo, for $x \\neq 0$, the equation becomes $$x^2 = -x$$ which does not have any real solutions.\nWhen $x = 0$, the equation becomes $$x^2 = 0$$ which always holds, and has one solution which is $x = 0$.\nTherefore, there is only $\\boxed{1}$ solution of $x$.",
        " Let $f(x) = x^2$. Since $f(x)$ is a quadratic function, $f(x)$ is increasing when $x$ is positive, and decreasing when $x$ is negative.\nNow we consider $g(x) = -|x|$. $g(x)$ is decreasing when $x$ is positive, and increasing when $x$ is negative.\nThe equation $f(x) = g(x)$ is equivalent to $x^2 + |x| = 0$. Now we analyze this equation from $x=0$ from the left.\nWhen $x<0$, $|x| = -x$ and we get the equations $x^2 - x = 0$ or $(x-1)(x+1) = 0$. Since $x < 0$, $x+1 < 0$. Hence there is no solution for $x+1$.\nOn the other hand, $(x-1)(x+1) = 0$ has one solution $x = -1 < 0$.\nHence, there is one solution for $x<0$.\nWe now look at the case $x>0$. $|x| = x$ and we get the equation $x^2 + x = 0$ or $(x+1)(x) = 0$. Since $x > 0$, $x > 0$. Hence, there is no solution for $x$.\nSo, there is no solution for $x > 0$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 1. I hope it is correct. ### Why Not Correct? The answer is incorrect.",
        " See Answer Here.\nWe have the equation $x^2=-|x|$, which is equivalent to $x^2=-(x)$, so $x^2=-x$. We can write this as $x^2+x=0$. Factoring this yields $(x+\\frac{1}{2})^2=\\frac{1}{4}$, which means $\\boxed{x=-\\frac{1}{2}}$ is the only possible solution for $x$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 1.

        " The first thing that comes to mind is that if $x=0$, it would satisfy the equation.\n### So our solution candidate list: $x=0datable ... the function. Now, let\u2019s get rid of the absolute value and look at the signs of $x$: $$x^2 = |x| \\Leftrightarrow x^2 = x \\text{ if $x>0$}$$ $$x^2 = -|x| \\Leftrightarrow -x^2 = x \\text{ if $x<0$}$$ Now, let\u2019s go through the cases step by step.\n### Case I: $x>0$. In this case $x^2=x$, which is a quadratic equation with only one solution, namely, $x=0$. Since it\u2019s not possible to have $x>0$ because then $x^2$ would not be equal to $-|x|$, we can disregard this case.\n### Case II: $x<0$. In this case $-x^2=x$, which is again a quadratic equation with only one solution, namely, $x=0$. Since we already know that $x=0$ satisfies the equation, our final solution set is simply $\\boxed{\\text{Just }x=0}$. We can conclude that there is only one solution for $x$.",
        " By intuition, we expect no solutions, as the equation will always yield imaginary numbers (except when $x=0$, where squaring gives zero and absolute value also gives zero). Let\u2019s write down the solutions by squaring both sides. Noting that $$x^2 = |x|^2,$$ we can write $$|x|^2 = -|x|,$$ or, moving the absolute value to the right: $$|x| = -|x|^2.$$ However, this is always false. When $|x| > 0$, we cannot square the expression on the left to get a non-positive expression. Similarly, when $|x| < 0$, we cannot take the square root of a negative expression on the right to get a positive expression. Therefore, there are no solutions, which corresponds to the correct answer, $\\boxed{0}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 0. I hope it is correct.",
        " \nWe start with $x^2 = -|x|$, which implies that $|x| = -(x^2)$.  Therefore, we have $|x| \\ge 0$ and $-(x^2) \\ge 0 \\Rightarrow -x^2 \\ge 0$,$x^2 \\le 0$.  So, $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and $0 \\ge x^2 \\ge 0$, which means that $x = 0$ only.  Since there is one solution, there are $\\boxed{1}$ solutions for $x.$\n### ",

Therefore, we cannot have $x$ being negative.\nCase (ii): $x$ is positive or zero.\nIf $x$ is positive, then $|x| = x$, and we have $$x^2 = x\\Rightarrow x(x-1) = 0\\Rightarrow x = 0, 1.$$ If $x = 0$, then we can see that $x^2 = -|x| = 0$ is satisfied.
