    "solution": "We know one point on the line: the camera is at $(0,10)$. To find another point on the line we can determine where Tina was when she noticed her camera was missing. She travels a total of $10+8+6+4+2$ units north from the origin, so her ending $y$-coordinate is $30$. She travels $9+7+5+3+1$ units east, so her ending $x$-coordinate is $25$. So we must find the equation of the line through $(0,10)$ and $(25,30)$. The slope of the line is $\\frac{30-10}{25-0}=\\frac{20}{25}=\\frac{4}{5}$. We can use point-slope form to find that the equation of the line is $(y-10)=\\frac{4}{5}(x-0)$, or $5(y-10)=4x$. Simplifying this gives $5y-50=4x$, so in the form requested, $\\boxed{4x-5y=-50}$.",

Notice that when she turns, her camera flies out at a point one unit above and to the left of where she is (specifically, $-10$ units to the right and $1$ unit up).

This means that she is currently located at $(-9, 8)$.\nThe last leg of her journey, getting back to her camera, can be described by a line $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the $y$-intercept. Since she moves east and is moving north with a constant slope, $m=0$.  Since she moves back to the point $(0,10)$, we know that $b=10$.

To find the slope of the line which was the last line that Tina stopped driving, we need to find the slope of the line connecting the points $(19,0)$ and $(18,2).$ We can use a formula: $$m=\\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}=\\frac{0-2}{19-18}=-2.$$We know that this slope is negative.  Tina\u2019s path can then be split into a number of parts.  One segment will be between point $(0,10)$ and point $(10,10)$ having a slope of zero, since it is horizontal and lying along the positive $y$-axis. Another segment is a segment with a slope $m_2=-2$ connecting the points  $(10,10)$ and $(19,1).$ So we would need to solve for a line that goes through $(19,1)$ and $(19,0).$ The slope passes through $(0,10)$ and this line we will call $L_1$. So, to use this, we take $m_2$ and $L_2.$ Now, the line $L_2$ would have slope zero, and it passes through $(0,10)$. A final segment will be between $(19,0)$ and $(0,10",
        " A linear equation of the line that Tina returns to $(0,10)$ will take the form $y=mx+c$, where $m$ is the slope. We first find $c$, which is the $y$-intercept. \nWhen Tina drives east from $(0,10)$, she moves at a constant rate, always to the right and up. At the end of this step, she has driven $9$ units and she reaches $(9,10)$, so her $x$-value increases by $9$ while her $y$-value remains the same. Then, she turns up, one unit less than the previous turn, and drives $8$ units, reaching $(9,18)$. From this new $y$-value, she now has increased her $y$-value by $8$ while her $x$-value remains the same. We do this one more time, until she reaches $(18,40)$.\nWe find $c$ by first drawing this path, or by thinking spatially, noting that when her $y$-value changes, her $x$-value remains the same; it only changes when she turns east. So her $x$-values change by intervals of length $-1, -2, \\dots, -9,0$, and her $y$-values change by intervals of length $9,8,7,\\dots,2,1$, corresponding to driving east $9$ times and then $1$ time and returning as $\\boxed{41}$.\n!. $c=10$, and we rewrite this as $\\boxed{y=x+10}$.\nWe cannot simplify this by either $y=mx+c$ or EPS.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is y = x + 10.

This is the equation of the line she has to follow to get to the camera.  To see why, note that if Tina stays on this line and follows it all the way to the origin, at the end she will be back at the origin with the same height, so this line is guaranteed to intersect with the line $y=-x+20$ somewhere between $(-10,10)$ and $(10,10)$.

Any point on the rectangle\u2019s corner and $(0,10)$ is on the line since it has the same slope and the slope is perpendicular to the sides of the rectangle.\nLater, she drives back to $(0,10)$ to pick up her camera, and we can note that this means the point $(1,0)$ is on the line segment.  Tina\u2019s path is a straight line, so the line we are looking for is just a line containing all those points. By the definition of slope, we can say that the slope is equal to $-10$.  Then we have $$\\frac{y-10}{x-0}=\\frac{10-0}{1-0}\\Rightarrow y=-10x+10.$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is y=-10x+10. I hope it is correct.\nThis problem is an interesting exercise in intuition and translation. The main task is to figure out the points that Tina reaches and then connect these points with line segments. The final line can be written as $y=-10x+10$.\nThe approach taken in this solution can be applied to many problems with similar flavors. It's important to understand that problems are presented in a way that requires manipulation and interpretation. For example, in the",
        " a)(0,10)\n### Step 1:  North 10 units, east for 9 units\nTina starts at the origin.  She drives 10 units north to get to (0,10) (not shown). Then drives 9 units east to get to (9,10).\n### Step 2:  North 8 units, east for 7 units\nTina drives 8 units north, to get to (9,18). Then drives 7 units east to get to (16,18).\n### Step 3:  North 6 units, east for 5 units\nTina drives 6 units north, to get to (16,24). Then drives 5 units east to get to (21,24).\n### Step 4:  North 4 units, east for 3 units\nTina drives 4 units north, to get to (21,28). Then drives 3 units east to get to (24,28).\n### Step 5:  North 2 units, east for 1 unit\nTina drives 2 units north, to get to (24,30). Then drives 1 unit east to get to (25,30).\n### Step 6:  Stop and start driving back to (0,10) in a straight line\nWell, we are at (25,30) now. The line passing through (25,30) and one other point will be the distance from the starting and ending points. What is that other point? After some further simplification the answer is $\\boxed{(5,0)}$. Well, (5,0) \u2026 you are almost on the negative $x$ axis. That will do.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 5x - 10y = 0. I hope it is correct.\n--------------------------------------------------------\n## Actual Solution:\nWell, let's also call the camera at (x,c).   We have a line passing through (25,30) and (x,c). The equation of the line through (25,30) and (x,c) is\n    y - 30 = \\frac{30-c}{25-x} (x - 25).\nWe know that this line goes through the point (0,10), so\n\\frac{10-c}{25-0} = \\frac{30-c}{25-0},\n10-c = 30-c,\n\\text{so } c = 20.\n\\frac{20-",
        " \nShe starts at origin. Drive 10 units north. She ends at $(0,10)$. Now, she turns east and drives 9 units. Then 8 units north, then 7 units east, and so on. The sequence of east and north driving is $9,8,\\dots,1$ which is an arithmetic sequence with common difference $-1$.\nWhen she is done, she ends up at $(-1,5)$.  We can find the slope using points:\n$$\\frac{5-10}{-1-0}=\\frac{-5}{-1}=5$$\nTo get $a$, we want to make the $a$ number as small as possible, so we make the denominator $-1$, which denotes the slope as positive.  We can rearrange to get: $$y-5=-x+5$$\n$$(y-5)+(x-5)=10$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is y-x+5 = 10. I hope it is correct.  \nOriginal ",
        " There are many ways to solve this problem. Here is a simple and elegant way to solve this problem. We may solve this problem by observing the path followed by Tina and drawing the figure.\nLet's first find the points where Tina's camera flies out the window. In the beginning, her camera flies out the window when Tina is at her starting point, the origin $(0, 0)$. Similarly, when Tina reaches $(0, 9)$, her camera flies out the window. \nWe now try to draw the steps performed by Tina from the starting point. When Tina reaches $(0, 9)$, she reaches the point where her camera flies out the window for the second time. She has now done two steps. She turns east and drives $9$ units, so she is at $(9, 9)$. Then she reaches the camera at $(0, 10)$, drives east for $9$ units, turns, and drives $8$ units north. So she is at $(9, 11)$. Then turns east and drives $8$ units, so she is at $(17,11)$. Then she reaches the camera at $(0, 10)$, drives east for $8$ units, turns, and drives $7$ units north. So she is at $(8, 17)$. Then she reaches the camera at $(0, 10)$, drives east for $7$ units, turns, and drives $6$ units north. So she is at $(15, 23)$. Then she reaches the camera at $(0, 10)$, drives east for $6$ units, turns, and drives $5$ units north. So she is at $(6, 28)$. Then she reaches the camera at $(0, 10)$, drives east for $5$ units, turns, and drives $4$ units north. So she is at $(11, 32)$.\nShe ultimately reaches the camera at $(0, 10)$, drives east for $1$ unit, arriving at the terminal point of the GPS line, at $(1, 32)$. Tina finally drives back to her camera in a straight line, as indicated. \nHence, the equation of the GPS line is $y-10=x-1$. By rearranging this\n$$\\boxed{y=x+9}$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is y=x+9. I hope it is correct. I am not sure it\u2019s",
        " \nLet\u2019s label the coordinates of each step in Tina\u2019s journey as follows.\n$$\\begin{array}{ccccccc}\n(x_1,y_1)&(x_2,y_2)&(x_3,y_3)&(x_4,y_4)&(x_5,y_5)&(x_6,y_6)&(x_7,y_7)\\\\\n(0,0)&(0,10)&(9,10)&(9,9)&(8,8)&(7,7)&(6,6)\n\\end{array}$$Then the line segment connecting the origin to Tina's camera is simply the line segment joining $(0,0)$ to $(0,10)$, which has equation $y=10$. Tina drives back to her camera in a straight line; since this line is perpendicular to the camera\u2019s line of flight and shares the $y$-intercept, the line segment from Tina to her camera is the line with equation $x=0$.\nTo get the equation of the line in the standard form $ax+by=c$, we can write\n$$y=10\\Rightarrow 0x+1\\cdot y=10$$or $$x=0 \\Rightarrow1 \\cdot x+0y=0.$$Thus, an answer in the standard form of the problem is $\\boxed{(1,0,10).}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is (1,0,10).
