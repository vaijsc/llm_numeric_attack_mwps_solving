    "solution": "First we find that the slope of the line is $\\frac{4 - 3}{7 - 6} = 1$.  Now, for any other point, $P = (x, y)$, to be on this line, the slope between $P$ and either of $(7, 4)$ or $(6, 3)$ must be equal to 1.  Thus $\\frac{y - 3}{x - 6} = 1 \\Rightarrow y = x - 3$.

Another great problem is this California Common Core problem: Credit by Examination questions page 5. $ $ x$-coordinate of the $x$-intercept $ = \\boxed{\\frac{11}{7}}$.\nFinal",
        "  We know from the definitions of the x and y-intercepts that an x-intercept occurs when the y-coordinate of a point of the line is 0. We want to find the x-coordinate at which this happens. We first create an equation linking the two points along the line, finding an equation of the form y=mx+c. Therefore, we do: \\begin{align}\n(m)(7)&=4\\\\\n(7m)&=4\n\\end{align} \\begin{align}\n(m)(6)&=3\\\\\n(6m)&=3.\n\\end{align}Dividing both sides of each equation by the coefficient of the x term on the left-hand side results in: \\begin{align}\nm&=\\frac{4}{7}\\\\\nm&=\\frac{3}{6}\\\\\nm&=\\frac{1}{2}.\n\\end{align}\nNow that we know what the slope, m, is, we rewrite a new equation using the slope and a point on the line. For example, using (7,4), we do: \\begin{align}\n(y \u2013 4)&=(1/2)(x-7)\\\\\ny-4&=(1/2)x-(7/2)\\\\\ny&=(1/2)x-(7/2)+4\n\\end{align}As we know, a point on the y-intercept has an y-coordinate of 0. Plugging this in, \\begin{align}\n0&=(1/2)x-(7/2)+4\\\\\n(1/2)x-(7/2)+4&=0\\\\\n-(7/2)&=0-4+(1/2)x\\\\\n-(7/2)&=4-(1/2)x\\\\\n\\frac{7}{2}&=(1/2)x-4\\\\\n7&=x-8\\\\\nx&=15\n\\end{align}\nThen, \\boxed{15} is the $x$-coordinate of the $x$-intercept.\n### Problem:~What is the equation of the line that passes through the points $(3,1)$ and $(-4,5)$?\nWe use the general form y = mx + c of a line. Thus, we plug in x = 3 and y = 1into the equation, as well as x = -4 and y = 5.\n\\begin{align}\n1&=3m+c",
        " So the slope of the line, $m$, for these two given points $(x_{1}, y_{1})=(7, 4)$ and $(x_{2}, y_{2})=(6, 3)$ is$${m = \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{4 \u2013 3}{7 \u2013 6} = 1.}$$Next, I want to find the equation of the line.  It looks like the line has the form $$y=\\underbrace{1}_{\\text{Slope}}(x) + \\underbrace{(4 - 7)}_{\\text{y-intercept}}$$So now I need to find the x-intercept, where $y=0$. Plugging in $0$ for $y$ and solving for $x$, $$0 = \\underbrace{1}_{\\text{Slope}}(x) + \\underbrace{(4 - 7)}_{\\text{y-intercept}}$$ $$-3 = 1(x)$$ $$x=\\boxed{-3}$$ Final Answer: The final answer is -3. I hope it is correct.",
        "  Here, a line contains the given point $(7,4)$ and $(6,3)$. We find the slope using the given points.\n\\begin{align*}\nm &= \\frac{y_2 \u2013 y_1}{x_2 \u2013 x_1}\\\\\nm &= \\frac{3-4}{6-7} = \u2013\\frac{1}{1} = -1.\n\\end{align*}\nNow, let us use the given points to find the equation of the line. Here, the equation of a line is given and is y \u2013 y1 = m(x \u2013 x1).\nHere, we use (7,4) as the point $(x_1,~ y_1)$.\n$$(y-4) = -1(x-7)\\\\\ny \u2013 4 = -x+7\\\\\ny+ x \u2013 11 = 0.$$\nNow we must set y = 0. This will be our $x$-coordinate for $x$-intercept.\n\\begin{align*}\n0+x-11=0\\\\\nx = \\boxed{11}\n\\end{align*}",
        " \nBy a short observation, you can find out that the line has an inclination (i.e. The slopes of lines are $\\frac{rw \\delta}{\\delta x}$)\nAn angle at which in a stable and constant manner each points are moving, is determined, which is the inclination of the line as will you find\nThe relation between the proportion is $m = \\frac{\\Delta \\mathit{y}}{\\Delta \\mathit{x}} = \\frac{y _ {2} - y _ {1}}{x _ {2} - x _ {1}}$ where there are no values except for $m$x since we took the ratio. Placing $m$ values in x$y as 4 6 = 1/1 3 7 Noticed that $m = 1$ the line is considered, which we have i \u2019ve here if you want the line either $y$ To find the melody, we can use the formula $y - y$1 = m (x - x1. It is worked to public \u2018this and\\( 3 - 4 = ( x - 7)\\)\\(1\\) To find the value of x, we must solve.\nThe answer is thus equal to $x = 6$\nHave to be added above paragraphs added material to me by me\n### ",
        " Because we know that when x=7, y = 4 and when x=6, y = 3 , we can consider the slope, as $$m=\\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}=\\frac{3-4}{6-7}=\\frac{-1}{1}=-1$$\nNow we know we have the slope $-1$ and $2$ values $x_1 = 6, y_1 = 3$ and $x_2 = 7, y_2 = 4,$ we can use slope- intercept formula to find the equation:\n$$y-y_1=m(x-x_1)$$ $$y-3-1(x-6)$$ $$y-3-x+6$$ $$y=x+3$$\nNow we are looking for $x$-intercept, where $y=0$, we can set:\n$$x+3=0$$ $$x=\\boxed{-3}$$\nTherefore, the $x$-coordinate for the $x$-intercept of the line is -3.\nFinal Answer:\u00a0The final answer is -3. I hope it is correct.  Finally, finally, the math, you can solve in possibility way like calculator, then we can get an answer  of x = -3.  Therefore, the $x$-coordinate for the $x$-intercept of the line is -3.\n### Where you fault with to ask question concerning your new list.\nLet us know, he is best, if asked a new question.\u00a0 That\u2019s it! I expect.  However, that\u2019s a challenge case.\nWe encourage you to ask.",
        " To solve this problem, we can use the point-slope form of a line, given by\n### $$y- y_1=m(x-x_1)$$where $m$ is the slope, $y_1$ is the $y$-coordinate of the point, and $x_1$ is the $x$-coordinate of the point.\n### First, we will calculate the slope:\n$$m=\\dfrac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}=\\dfrac{3-4}{6-7}=\\dfrac{-1}{-1}=1.$$\n### So, we can write\n$$y-3=1(x-x_1)$$\n### We will now substitute $(7,4)$ into this equation. We get\n### $$4-3=1(7-x_1)$$\n### which simplifies to\n### $$1=7-x_1$$\n### So, $x_1$ is the $x$-coordinate for the $x$-intercept of the line, which is $\\boxed{6.}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 6.

        " To find the $x$-intercept, we need the line given in the form of $y = mx + b$.
