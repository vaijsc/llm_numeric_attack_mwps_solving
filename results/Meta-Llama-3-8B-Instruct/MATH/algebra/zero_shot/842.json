        " \nStep 1: The equation $6t^2 + 30 = 41t$ can be rewritten as $6t^2 - 41t + 30 = 0$. To solve for $t$, we first want to try to factor the left side. We can use the new formula to help us factor. The formula says that if $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, we can write $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$. So in our case, $a = 6, b = -41$, and $c = 30$. Thus, the right side of our equation should look like $(6x-\\)_or_(6x+) = 0$. Setting the first half equal to 0 and then solving for $x$ would give us $x = 5$. Plugging this value back in to the original equation, we find that $30 = 30$, so the equation is satisfied. Plugging $x$ = -1 into the equation, we also find that it is satisfied, as _-5_. The positive difference between these solutions is our final answer, which is $5 - (-1) = \\boxed{6}$. Therefore, the correct answer is 6.
