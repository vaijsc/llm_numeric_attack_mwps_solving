His height off the ground at time $t$ is $2t^2-5t+29$ feet.\nTo the nearest foot, what will his minimum height be?\n### Solution:\nRecall that the minimum value of a quadratic function $f(t) = at^2 + bt + c$ occurs at its vertex. The coordinates of the vertex can be found using the formula $\\left(-\\dfrac{b}{2a}, f\\left(-\\dfrac{b}{2a}\\right)\\right)$. In our case, $f(t) = 2t^2 - 5t + 29$, so $\\left(-\\dfrac{b}{2a}, f\\left(-\\dfrac{b}{2a}\\right)\\right) = \\left(\\dfrac{5}{4}, \\dfrac{29+25/4}{2} = \\dfrac{41}{4}\\right)$.\nSo, the minimum height of Ben is $\\boxed{10}$ feet.\n### Example:\nWhat is the equation of the parabola that has a maximum value at the point $(2, 17)$?\nSolution: The coordinates of the vertex of a quadratic function $f(t) = at^2 + bt + c$ is its minimum value if $a < 0$, and its maximum value if $a > 0$. In this case, the vertex of the parabola is $(2, 17)$, so the coordinates of the vertex are $$\\left(-\\dfrac{b}{2a}, f\\left(-\\dfrac{b}{2a}\\right)\\right) = (2, 17).$$\nHere, $f(t) = at^2 + bt + c = 17$, so $a(2)^2 + b(2) + c = 17$, and $4a + 2b + c = 17$. Using this equation, the parabola can be written as $$\nf(t) = at^2 + \\left(17 - 4a - c\\right)t + c = a(t-2)^2 + (17-4a-c).$$\nTo get the equation in the form $f(t) = at^2 + bt + c$, we have $$a(t-2)^2 = at^2 - 4at + 4a",

Based on the equation above, $a = 2$, $b = -5$, and $c = \\frac{113}{8}$, so we can use these values to find the vertex of $h(t)$: the $x$-coordinate is $\\frac{-b}{2a}$, which we know is $\\frac{-(-5)}{2*2} = \\frac{5}{4}$, and the $y$-coordinate of the vertex will be $h(\\frac{5}{4}) = 2(\\frac{5}{4})^2 - 5(\\frac{5}{4}) + 29 = \\frac{113}{8}$.\nTherefore, the vertex of the quadratic function is $(\\frac{5}{4}, \\frac{113}{8})$.

        " Ben will have minimum height at a time when the first derivative of his height is equal to 0.

In other words, the equation $4t-5=0$ must be solved.  This is a simple linear equation.  This is true when $t=\\frac{5}{4}$.\nWe are asked for Ben\u2019s minimum height to the nearest whole number, so we want this height to make the first derivative equal to 0 as well.\nFor this particular point, if it is the minimum height, then the second derivative $h\u2019\u2019(t)=4$ will be positive at that point. Therefore, this point of height is the minimum of $h(t)$.\nPlugging in the value of $t$ into $h(t)$, we get $2(\\frac{5}{4})^2-5(\\frac{5}{4})+29=22.5$.

        " \nFinal Answer: The final answer is 9 feet. I hope it is correct. According to the problem, the height of Ben off the ground at any given time t is given by $h(t)=2t^2-5t+29$ feet. To find the minimum height of Ben, we need to find the value of t where the derivative of h(t) with respect to t is equal to 0. We can use the power rule of differentiation to write the derivative as $\\frac{dh}{dt}=4t-5$.\n### When the derivative is equal to zero, $4t-5=0$. We can solve the equation by adding 5 to both sides: $4t=5$. Then, we can divide both sides by 4 to get $t=5/4$. Since h(t) is continuous at this point, the minimum height will occur at $t=5/4$. Therefore, plugging t=5/4 into the height function h(t)=2t^2-5t+29, we get\n$\\begin{equation*}\nh\\left(\\frac{5}{4}\\right)=2\\left(\\frac{5}{4}\\right)^2-5\\left(\\frac{5}{4}\\right)+29=9.75\n\\end{equation*}$\nMr. Ben\u2019s minimum height is approximately 10 feet (because he is a real person, so we round the answer to the nearest foot). However, the exact value is 9.75. Once again, the final answer is 9 feet. I hope it is correct. Thanks for the confirmation. Well, I'm glad I could be of assistance.

        " 1. We will find the minimum height, say, $y$ , by completing the square on the binomial $2t^2-5t$ , to get $y = 2(t^2-\\frac{5}{2}t)+29$ . Completing the square, we have $y = 2(t-\\frac{5}{4})^2 + \\frac{169}{2} = (\\sqrt{2}(t-\\frac{5}{4}))^2 + \\frac{169}{2}$.\n2. Evidently, $(\\sqrt{2}(t-\\frac{5}{4}))^2 \\geq 0$ . Therefore, the minimum of $(\\sqrt{2}(t-\\frac{5}{4}))^2$ , which is $0$ , is achieved when $t = \\frac{5}{4}$ . This implies that $y = \\frac{169}{2} = 84.5$  so that Ben has a minimum height of 84 feet.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 84 feet. I hope it is correct.",
        " We know that to get the minimum height (its just like finding the minimum of some function), we need to find the value of $t$ that makes $2t^2-5t+29$ minimal.\n### To find the minimum, we need to find its derivative: $$f(t) = 2t^2 - 5t + 29\\\\ f'(t) = 4t - 5$$\nAccording to the Derivative Rules, this gives us the slope of the function $f(t)$ at the point $t$. We know that to get the minimum, the slope (or the derivative) needs to be 0. Let\u2019s set $f'(t) = 0$:\n$$4t-5=0\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad 4t=5\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad t=\\frac{5}{4}.$$\nSo, the minimum height is gonna be reached when $t=\\frac{5}{4}$.\n### Now, we only need to plug in $t=\\frac{5}{4}$ into $f(t)$ to find the minimum value:\n$$f\\left(\\frac{5}{4}\\right) = 2\\left(\\frac{5}{4}\\right)^2-5\\cdot \\frac{5}{4}+29=2.5-12.5+29=19$$\n### Thus, we can say that the minimum height will be approximately $\\boxed{19}$ feet when $t=\\frac{5}{4}$.\n### Why do I keep using 0.5 instead of 0.5 feet? Well, the problem specifically asks for the answer to the nearest foot, not to the nearest tenth of a foot, so I don\u2019t need to write both 19 feet and 19.5 feet as possible answers. I know that my answer is correct if I stop at 19. And this matches because I used 0.5 as a fine adjustment, so I could get to an answer that is as good as I could with just 0.5.\nI hope this step by step explanation helps you understand how to solve this problem better. Good luck! If you have any questions or any ideas for me to explain better, please let me know. Thanks for your feedback!\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 19.

        "  We want to find the minimum value of $2t^2-5t+29$ with respect to $t$. To do this, we first need to find $t$-intercepts.
