    "solution": "The two digit number can be represented as $10x + y,$ where $x$ and $y$ are digits, with $x \\neq 0.$ We are given that the sum of the digits is $13,$ so $x + y = 13.$ If we reverse the digits of this number, we have $10y + x.$ We are given that the difference is $27,$ but we don't know if the original number or if the number with its digits reversed is greater. We can show this as such: $$|(10x + y) - (10y + x)| = 27.$$ However, it doesn't matter which of the two numbers is greater, since we wish to find their sum. So, without loss of generality, we will let the first number be the larger of the two. This means that $x > y,$ so we can get rid of the absolute values in our last equation to obtain $9x - 9y = 27,$ equivalent to $x - y = 3.$\n\nWe now have two equations in two variables: $x + y = 13$ and $x - y = 3.$ Adding the two, we obtain $2x = 16,$ so $x = 8.$ Subtracting, we obtain $2y = 10,$ so $y = 5.$ Thus, the original number is $85,$ and our answer is $85 + 58 = \\boxed{143}.$\n\nOR\n\nAs before, the two digit number can be expressed as $10x + y,$ and the number with its digits reversed is $10y + x.$ We want to find the sum of these two numbers, which is $$(10x + y) + (10y + x) = 11x + 11y = 11(x + y).$$ We are given that the sum of the digits is $13,$ so $x + y = 13.$ Since all we want is $11(x + y),$ we can substitute for $x + y$ to obtain our answer of $11\\cdot 13 = \\boxed{143}.$",

        " \nLet the two-digit number be $10a+b$. The sum of the digits is $a+b=13$, or $a=6$ or $b=7$, and given that neither $a$ nor $b$ can be $0$. (Because the two-digit number is $1$ digit short to be $3$ digits.)  Thus $10a+b=60+7=67$ or $67+6=10\\cdot6+7$. Also, the difference between $67$ and its reversed number $76$ is $9$. If a number with digits $a$ and $b$ has $1$ digit is swapped with digit $b$ and $a$, this number with digits $b$ and $a$, the difference is $9$, its value is $10b+a - (10b+a)=9$. Thus, $10b+a-(10a+b)=9$. It simplifies to $a-b=9$. We already calculated that $a=6$, so $6-b=9$, thus $b=-3$, which does not satisfy that $b\\ge1$, and the only remaining option is $b=7$.\nThus, we just need to add 67 and 76 together which is equal to 143. \nFinal Answer: The final answer is 143.

        " We can start by identifying the number, $k$. Then we can identify the number $k$ with its digits reversed, $R$.\nIf we note that $k$ is a two-digit number, it can be represented as $10a+b$ where $a$ is the tens digit and $b$ is the units digit. A little more work in terms of $k$ and $R$, we can work backward (pun intended).\nWe are given that the sum of its digits is $13$, so we know that $a+b=13$.\nThen we are given that the difference between $k$ and $R$ is $27$, so we can write\n$$10a+b-(10R+b)=27.$$We will then rewrite this, substituting $a+b=13$ into the parenthesis: $$\\Rightarrow 10a+(13-a)-(10R+13-R)=27,$$ Now we have another equation to work with. We can combine $10a$, $10R$ and subtract $13$ from each side and simplify to get $$9a-9R=1$$ Finally, $a$ and $R$ represent the same thing (the tens digit), so they must be the same. Then as the number of $a$\u2019s and $R$\u2019s is equal, it becomes a matter of how many numbers being equal.\nSuppose that $a = R= \\boxed{2}$. Then $a + b = 2 + 11 = 13$ which satisfies the condition. Then $k = 20$. Since $2 + 11 = 13$, we know that $k = 20, R = 02, k + R = 20 + 02 = \\boxed{22}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 22. I hope it is correct. There are $22$ numbers in this problem and $27$ in between them. Moreover, we can solve this problem in a few easy steps of arithmetic. The first step is to decide what values $a$ and $b$ can have. Since $a + b = 13,$ we will try finding all combinations of $13$ that fit into two parts and obtain a reasonable value. Since $a$ and $b$ are also numbers that cannot be more than $1$ and less than $0,$ then $a$ must be at least $1$ and at most $12,$ and $b$ must be at least $",

Let\u2019s go through the problem without using my intuition first.\n### Thinking:\nA two-digit number can be written as $10x+y$ where $x$ and $y$ are digits from $0$ to $9$. The sum of these digits is given as $x+y=13$. The difference between the number and the number with its digits reversed is given as $(10x+y)-(10y+x)=27$. Thus, we have\n$$10x+y-(10y+x)=2x-9y=27$$\nWe can now ARRANGE the given equations.\nWe can solve for $y$ in the first equation to obtain $y=13-x$. Now plug this expression into the second equation.\n$$(10x)+(13-x)-10(13-x)-x=2x-9(13-x)=27$$\nSimplifying gives\n$$9x-81=27 \\Rightarrow 9x=108$$\nThus, $x=12$ and $y=1$. Hence, we have to find $10x+y$ and $10y+x$ which are $61$ and $16$.\nNow, the question asks what the sum of the two numbers is.

If $d_1 = 4$, then the given number is $42$, and its reverse is $24$. Then the difference is $18,$ which is not equal to $27$.

Find the Particular Solution\nNow, let\u2019s consider a particular case of the expression. Since $a + b = 13,$ we can set $a = 7$ and $b = 6$ (since the largest possible sum of digits of a two-digit number is $\\boxed{18},$ so the maximum $a$ can be is 7, and if $a$ is 7, the maximum $b$ can be is 6).

        " Original number a10 + b1 = 10a + b. Sum of digits is 13 so a + b = 13.\nNumber with digits reversed is 10b + a. Difference between them is 27 so (10a + b) - (10b + a) = 27. Simplify, we get 9a - 9b = 27. This gives a - b = 3.\na + b = 13 so a = 7, b = 6.\nNumber with digits reversed is 10b + a = 10(6) + 7 = 67.\nSum of the original number and the number with its digits reversed is 10a + b + 10b + a = 20a + 10b = 20(7) + 10(6) = 140 + 60 = $\\boxed{200}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 200.
