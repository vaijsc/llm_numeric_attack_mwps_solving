        " The solution to the equation $|2-x|= 3$ is $x=5$ or $x=-1$.\nThe absolute value function is defined as $|x|=\\begin{cases}x & x\\ge 0 \\\\\\ -x & x<0\\end{cases}$. We need the values of $x$ at which the equation becomes true.\nUsing this knowledge, we know that if $2-x\\ge 0$ (which means $x\\le 2$), we get $2-x=3$ or $x=-1$ from the equation. But if $2-x<0$ (which means $x>2$), we get $-(2-x)=3$ or $x=5$. Therefore we have our two solutions $x=5$ and $x=-1$.\n### ",

        " $2 - x = 3 \\rightarrow \\boxed{x = - 1}$.\n$\\displaystyle - x = 3 - 2 \\rightarrow - x = 1 \\rightarrow x = \\displaystyle \\boxed{-1}$\n### Final Answer: The final answer is x = -1. I hope it is correct.\nSolution: Another way to find the root,\n$x - 2 = -3$\n$x = -3 + 2$\n$x = \\boxed{-1}$\nAnother step,\n$2 - x = 3$\n$2 - 3 = x$\n$-1 = x$.\nFrom the above denoted both cases should get the same result. Therefore, the answer is $x = -1$. Where $|2-x| = 3$ has only one solution. It is important to realize that it is the only solution since by the definition of absolute value, when we say $|a-b| = C$ and C is greater than 0, we mean that either $a-b = C$ (positively) or $a-b = -C$, which would be equivalent to $a-b=C$ (negatively). But since the 3 on the right-hand side is greater than 0 the only solution should be at the point where $a-b=C$, and since $a=2$, this means $a-b=3$ should be equivalent to $2-x=3$, as we have shown. The equation $a-b=-C$ is not relevant for this problem, since it would be equivalent to $2-x=-3$, and since 3 is greater than 0, the solution would be $x=5$, which is not valid. If you divide the problems into two cases and you get the same answer, that means you can combine them by combining the two expressions of |x-y| on the left-hand side. In this problem, it is equivalent to combine |2-x| = 3 into $(2-x)+3=0$, which would be equivalent to $2-x=3$.",

        " We need to find solutions to the equation $|2-x|=3$.\nWe know that the value of $|2-x|$ must be $3$ for $|2-x|$ to be equal to $3$. Now, the absolute value signs indicate that we must consider two cases: (1) the value inside the absolute value signs is nonnegative, and (2) the value inside the absolute value signs is negative. When solving absolute value equations, we write two separate equations using the value, and then find solutions to both equations.",
        " \nWe first make use of absolute value property. If we like, we can divide the equation into two cases: when $x>2$ and when $x\\le 2$.\nWhen $x>2$, we have\n$$2-x=3\\Leftrightarrow x=-1,$$since $x>2$. This is not a solution because $x>2$.\nWhen $x\\le 2$, we have\n$$-(2-x)=3\\Leftrightarrow x=-1.$$This is the only solution. Therefore, the sum of all solutions is -1.\nWe got $\\boxed{-1}$.\n### End of ",
        " \nWell, $\\left|2-x\\right| = 3$ is equivalent to $\\left| x-2 \\right| = 3$, so we can find the solutions.\nSolution to $\\left|x-2\\right| = 3$:\nLet $x-2 = 3$ (by the principle of the absolute value, $x$ can only be $2+3$ or $2-3$). Solving the equation for $x$, we have $x-2 = 3$, which becomes $x = 3+2$, so $x = \\boxed{5}$.\nLet $x-2 = -3$ (by the principle of the absolute value, $x$ can only be $2+3$ or $2-3$).

        " First, we will solve for positive values. We get $2-x=3 \\rightarrow x = -1$ (this solution will also be reflected at the origin and appear again), and $x - 2 = 3 \\rightarrow x = 5$. $-1$ and $5$ are our solutions. Now, we will solve for negative values. We get $2-x = -3 \\rightarrow x = 5$ (we add $3$ again to get positive), and $x - 2 = -3 \\rightarrow x = -1$ (this is another solution of course). So, $-1$ and $5$ are the complete negative values we want.\n### The question wants us to find the sum of all the solutions. So we will take:\n$-1 + 5 = 4$\nNow we got $4$.",
        " \nNote that the absolute value has its value always positive or zero, so we can rewrite the equation as \n$$\\begin{cases}\n2-x=3, &\\mbox{when } x<2,\\\\\n-(2-x)=3, &\\mbox{when } x>2.\n\\end{cases}$$The first equation can be solved to obtain $x = -1$, and the second equation can also be solved to obtain $x = -1$ as well. Thus, the equation $|2-x| = 3$ has a solution set of $\\boxed{-1}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -1. I hope it is correct. ",
