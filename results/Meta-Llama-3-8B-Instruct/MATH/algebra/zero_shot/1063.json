I hope it is correct. This method of solving for $z$ is often referred to as \"algebraic manipulation\" or \"equation solving by manipulation\". It makes use of the definition of the imaginary unit $i$, namely $i^2 = -1$. It is important to be careful when working with complex numbers and algebra, as the rules for the real numbers do not always apply to complex numbers. In this case, the algebraic manipulation is necessary to solve for $z$ in a straightforward manner. This method is often the most convenient way to solve equations involving complex numbers. It is also useful to note that $z = -\\frac{1}{i}$ is an equivalent solution, meaning that $z = \\frac{1}{i}$ is also a valid solution to the equation. This is because $z = \\frac{1}{i}$ is the original value, and after the manipulation was performed, the value was changed to $z = -\\frac{1}{i}$. This highlights the importance of recognizing that complex numbers need not come with a linear structure, as the rules for the real numbers do. Final Answer: The final answer is $\\frac{1}{i}$.

        " 2-3iz is equal to $3+2iz$.\nThis is an equation from algebra and I assume that I must actually isolate $z$ for the solution.\n### Requested Solution: <![If you need help with solving equations, I can assist you (but I will need to know if you wish your answer as fractions, decimals, etc. or expressed in the form a/b). For the equation 2-3iz = 3+2iz, I think we should add 3iz and -3iz to both sides of the equation. This way, it becomes 2 = 3+5iz. This is close but we cannot stop here. So, next we must subtract 3 from both sides to get -1 = 5iz. Now we are ready to solve for z. We can take -1 and divide it by 5 to get -\\frac{1}{5} = z. So, the answer is -\\frac{1}{5} or -1/5. ]]> Failed to parse (MathML with SVG or PNG fallback (recommended for modern browsers and accessibility tools): Invalid response (\"Math extension cannot connect to Restbase.\") from server \"https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/\":): {\\displaystyle -\\frac{1}{5}}.
