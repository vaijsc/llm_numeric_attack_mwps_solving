We first find a pair of binomials whose product produces the three terms on the left side: $(2x+3)(5y+7) = 10xy+14x+15y+21$.  So, we add $21$ to both sides of the original equation to get $10xy+14x+15y+21=187$.  Factoring then gives $(2x+3)(5y+7)=187=11\\cdot17$.  If either $(2x+3)$ or $(5y+7)$ equal 1, then $x$ or $y$ would be negative.  If $5y+7$ equals 11, then $y$ would not be an integer.  So, $5y+7=17$ and $2x+3=11$.  Solving for $(x,y)$ gives $(4,2)$.

        "We start with the equation:\n\\[\n10xy + 14x + 15y = 166.\n\\]\nTo simplify the equation, we can rearrange it into a more manageable form. We can rearrange and consider factoring or completing the terms.\nReorganizing it, we have:\n\\[\n10xy + 14x + 15y - 166 = 0.\n\\]\nThis is a non-linear equation, and we need to find integer solutions for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). We can express \\(y\\) in terms of \\(x\\):\n\\[\n10xy + 14x + 15y = 166 \\implies 10xy + 15y = 166 - 14x \\implies y(10x + 15) = 166 - 14x \\implies y = \\frac{166 - 14x}{10x + 15}.\n\\]\nFor \\(y\\) to be a positive integer, \\(166 - 14x\\) must be divisible by \\(10x + 15\\). We can solve \\(166 - 14x = k(10x + 15)\\) for integer values \\(k\\):\n1. Rewrite:\n\\[\n166 - 14x = 10kx + 15k \\implies 166 = 14x + 10kx + 15k \\implies 166 = x(14 + 10k) + 15k.\n\\]\n2. The rearranged equation becomes:\n\\[\nx(14 + 10k) = 166 - 15k \\implies x = \\frac{166 - 15k}{14 + 10k}.\n\\]\nFor \\(x\\) to be a positive integer, \\(166 - 15k\\) must be positive and divisible by \\(14 + 10k\\).

Since $83-7x$ can only be a perfect multiple of a divisor of $5$, we try to complete the square for both sides: $$0\\le \\bigl|5y-\\frac{1}{2}\\bigr|\\le \\frac{1}{2}\\Rightarrow y\\in \\{\\lceil\\frac{1}{10}\\rceil,\\lfloor\\frac{1}{10}\\rceil\\}.$$Since $y$ is a positive integer, $y$ must equal $\\lfloor\\frac{1}{10}\\rfloor$, which is 0. But since $(2x+3)(5y-1)$ cannot be negative, at least $5y-1$ must equal 1, in which case we may divide both sides by $(5y-1)$: $$2x+3=\\frac{7x-83}{5y-1}.$$Now, we simplify: $$2x+3=\\frac{7x-(8\\cdot83)}{1}\\Rightarrow -x=83\\Rightarrow \\boxed{x=83}.$$And so, we have $(x,y)=(83,0)$.

        "  Let $x+y = s$, where $s$ is a positive integer.\nFirst, write the given equation as\n$14x+15y=166-10xy.$\nThe $x$\u2019s and the $y$\u2019s are positive integers, so we consider the possibilities for the product $xy$ and work backwards.\nFirst, suppose $xy=1$.  \nThen, $14x+15y = 166-10 = 156,$\nwhich gives\n$x+\\frac{15y}{14}=11+\\frac{6}{7}$\n$\\Rightarrow y=\\frac{14}{15}\\cdot 11+\\frac{6}{7}=10.$\nHowever, $x+\\frac{15(10)}{14}=11+\\frac{150}{14},$ which is impossible.\nNext, suppose $xy=2$. \nThen, $14x+15y=166-20=146,$\nwhich gives\n$x+\\frac{15y}{14}=10+\\frac{4}{7}$\n$\\Rightarrow y=\\frac{14}{15}\\cdot 10+\\frac{4}{7}=12.$\nHence, $x+\\frac{15(12)}{14}=10+\\frac{160}{14}$, which is impossible.\nContinuing in this way, we conclude that $xy=16$. Then, $166-160=6$, so $14x+15y=6,$ which implies $x+\\frac{15y}{14}=\\frac{1}{7},$ which is impossible.\nTherefore, we must have $xy>16$, and $x+y=s$, which gives\n$10xy+14x+15y=166 \\Rightarrow 10xy+14s+20=166 \\Rightarrow xy=\\frac{152-14s}{10}$.\nHere, the denominator is positive and the numerator is congruent to $2$ (mod $4$), so $xy$ must be odd.

Then subtract $10(16)$ from both sides  $10xy+14x+15y-10(16)=10(16)-10(16)$, this becomes $10xy+14x+15y-10(16)=0$ and we have $10xy+14x+15y=10(16)=160$.\n### ",
        " An algebraic equation is given: $10xy + 14x + 15y = 166$\u2026 Because there are $x$ and $y$, both are positive integers, we know that $a b+14b+15a = 166$.  In short, \u201cab+14b+15a = 166\u201d, which could be (1ab+14b = 166-15a), then we could divide both side by 1. By adding it to the remaining term of the right side, we are basically 166 - 15a + 1b We know $1ab+14b = 166-15a$ because with 166 - 15a, if we increase it by b and prove it. This is $(1b) + (14b) = b + 14b$, so when we divide it by 1 (on the left and the right), it will be b, which remains b, I. It is $(1a) + (14b) = 166 - 15a$. Once there is a term, it can be changed into b'a + 14'a + 166 - 15=a'. Let the problem solve it. Let's be equal. Because the term a' = ab is not to be overlooked. ab Then for b' = 14'a allows us to simplify as follows: ab = 14'a ab / b' = 14'a/b' AB = 14a.

        " To solve this question, we have to find an integer solution for $x$ and $y$. We are given the equation $10xy+14x+15y=166$.  Now, we can rearrange it to $\\frac{14x+15y}{10}=x+\\frac{xy+y}{10}=x+\\frac{y}{10}(x+1)$.  For if $y>0$, we have $\\frac{14x+15y}{10}\\ge x$ because $x\\ge 0$. We also know that $\\frac{y}{10}\\in \\mathbb{Z}$.  Since we have the limitation $\\frac{14x+15y}{10}\\in \\mathbb{Z}$ as well, it is reasonable to represent it by $\\frac{1}{10}k$, where $k\\in \\mathbb{Z}$.  So, we would have $10x+k=y(x+1)$.  From here, we would write $10x=k(x+1)$ which is equivalent as $kx=10x-10$.  Now, to solve, we would divide both sides by $kx$.  If we let $k$ and $x$ both zero, we obtain $(\\frac{y}{k} .\\frac{y}{x})$ which can be simplified as $10$.  Thus, for the case where $x$ is divisible by $y$, this would be simplified to $\\frac{10y}{k}=x$.  We can choose one solution which is $x=4$, $y=5$.
