        " Let\u2019s think step by step.\nGiven the equation $x(x+10) = 10(-10-x)$. We can start by addressing the left-hand side of the equation. We have the product of $x$ and $x+10$. This product can be expanded using the distributive property: $x^2+10x$.\nSo, the equation becomes: $x^2+10x = 10(-10-x)$.\nNow, let\u2019s simplify the right-hand side by evaluating the expression inside the parentheses.\nWe have: $-100-x$\nSo, the equation becomes: $x^2+10x = -100-x$.",
        " \nWe need to solve the equation $x(x + 10) = 10(-10 - x)$, or equivalently,\n$$x^2 + 10x = -10x - 100.$$\nAdding $100x$ to both sides gives\n$$x^2 + 110x + 100 = 0.$$\nThis equation factors as\n$$(x + 5)(x + 20) = 0.$$\nEquating each factor to zero, we have $x + 5 = 0$ and $x + 20 = 0$. Solving for $x$ in each equation, we obtain $x = \\boxed{-5}$ and $x = \\boxed{-20}$. (Note that $x$ is an unknown quantity, not a vector or matrix.)\nFinal Answer: The final answers are -5 and -20.

We can also verify these roots by substituting each one back into the original equation and showing that the equation is true. ayr\u0131nt\u0131l\u0131/student-explanation: Of course, always try to factor or simplify the equation if possible. However, for this particular problem, the factored form is not easily apparent, so the quadratic formula is needed. The square root operation is used because we are dealing with a quadratic equation, which always has this form. Additionally, the discriminant in the quadratic formula has a square root on it, which contributes to the square root operation. I hope that provides clarity on the thought process for this solution!
