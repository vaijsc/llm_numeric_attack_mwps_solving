That\u2019s a range of 8 possible integer values, from 5 to 12.\n### Answer: There are either 7 or 8 values that satisfy the condition, depending on how we interpret the problem. The conditions can be satisfied with $t=5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11$, or 12. My preference is to define $\\sqrt{x}$ as the set of all values $y$ which satisfy $y\\ge 0$ and $y^2=x$. MLMheimlundia suggests that the problem is asking for integer values of $t$ such that $\\sqrt{t}$ is positive and between 2 and 3.5. He or she interprets the $\\sqrt{t}>2$ condition as $\\sqrt{t} \\ge 2$, and the $\\sqrt{t}<3.5$ condition as $\\sqrt{t} \\le 3.5$. MLMheimlundia argues that there are 7 integer values which satisfy $2 \\le \\sqrt{t} \\le 3.5$, and which are thus solutions to the given system of inequalities: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. The rest of us, on the other hand, need $\\sqrt{t} > 2$, which implies $t > 4$, not $t \\ge 4$. Thus, within the given range of 4 to 12.25, there are ",

        "If $t$ is an integer and the square root of $t$ is greater than $2$, then $t\\ge4$, since $2^2=4$.  This implies that $t\\ge4$.If the square root of $t$ is also less than $3.5$, then its square must be less than $(3.5)^2=12.25$.

        " To give a clear explanation. \nGiven: The square root of t is greater than 2 and less than 3.5.\n$$\\sqrt{t}>2$$\n$$t>4$$\nNotice the distance between every successive integer starting from 5 (5, 6, 7, 8, ... , and so on).\nNow consider: \n$$\\sqrt{t} < 3.5$$\n$$t < 12.25$$\nAgain, I noticed the distance between every successive integer, starting from 12 (12, 11, 10, 9, ...).\nTo our understanding of the situation, I would see the values 5,6,7,8,9,10,11 written down. \nThe values outside the range (t<12.25) etc are not considered.\nHowever, from the important question: How many integer values of t satisfy this condition? We should be allowed to select any of those values. So we see that we have:\n5,6,7,8,9,10,11\nHowever, the answer wants me to specifically see that these are the only integer values. But they are the only integer values satisfying the condition, because any value t < 4 will have a square root less than 2, so there is no t that satisfies the starting condition. (clearly).\nIt seems like it's hard to realize things from the \u201cgraphs\u201d that imply there is only one equation exists or more then one. To make it clear:\nThe values we got are only the ones satisfying t > 4, and t < 12.25. But this condition only exists one time in t<4 when t=4 which doesn't meet t > 4 condition.
