    "solution": "Though we can solve this by substitution, an easier way to solve the problem is to simply add the two equations. Then, $$ab + 5a + 2b = -10 \\Longrightarrow ab + 5a + 2b + 10 = 0.$$ This factors! Thus, $(a+2)(b+5) = 0$, from which it follows that at least one of the two statements $a = -2$, $b = -5$ is true. In the latter case, we obtain $a = \\boxed{2}$, which yields the largest possible value of $a$.",

        " The answer is 2.\nIt seems you are correct. First let's solve for $b$ in the first equation. $b = -\\frac{5}{2}a$. Substitute to the second equation: $a\\left(-\\frac{5}{2}a\\right)=-10$. Take $\\frac{5}{2}$ out from the equation. $\\left(a\\right)\\left(-\\frac{5}{2}a\\right)\\left(-\\frac{5}{2}\\right)=-10*\\frac{5}{2}$. The equation simplifies to $a^2=10$. You can't take the square root of one equation without another equation too. So you will have two answers for the value of $a$: positive as well as negative.  $a=+ \\sqrt{10}$, $a=- \\sqrt{10}$. Substitute them to the first equation and find the value of $b$ for them. Now we know $a$ is $\\pm \\sqrt{10}$ and $b$ is an integer.

I hope it is correct. Another solution is that from $5a+2b=0$ we obtain $-b=-\\frac{5}{2}a$. Plugging this into the second equation, we obtain $$-\\frac{5}{2}a \\cdot a = -10 \\Rightarrow a^2=\\boxed{4}.$$ Since it a discriminant it can not be negative and as per order we have $|4|=4$ as a greatest value. Didn\u2019t we learn we could just try to see what happens if we use a number and see what happens? Then I could also go to solve the first equation, in this case looking for the biggest integer value, so what if I first assume $a = 5$ there should be something. So in this case we would have $25 + 2b = 0$, so $2b = -25$ and $b = -\\frac{25}{2}$. Now let\u2019s check that this combination is valid. If we substitute these values into the second equation we get $ab = 5 \\cdot -\\frac{25}{2}$ $= -\\frac{125}{2}$ is equal to $-10$ and so a valid choice.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 4.

        " Noted Maths Tutor (Ms. Pat Mathew)\nI think it is better to look at the second equation, $ab = -10$, first, as we know that one of $a$ and $b$ has to be negative. If we let $a < 0$ and $b > 0$, and $|a| \\ge |b|$, we can cancel the minus signs and get $|a|b = 10$. Dividing both sides by $|a| > 0$, we get $b = \\frac{10}{|a|}$.\nWe can use this $b$ value in the first equation to get $5a - \\frac{20}{|a|} = 0$. Simplifying, we get $5a = \\frac{20}{|a|}$. Now we know that $|a|$ is less than or equal to the positive square root of $100$, as $|a|$ is actually an absolute value. So, we can write the equation as $5a = \\frac{20}{a} \\Rightarrow 5a^2 = 20 \\Rightarrow a^2 = \\frac{20}{5} = 4 \\Rightarrow a = \\pm 2$. This gives us $\\boxed{2}$ as the greatest possible value of $a$.\n### Thanks\nI hope this explanation is helpful.

        " In these two equations, we know the first equation makes b negative because of the negative sign, so for each possible value of a, b will be negative. However, the second equation says that ab = -10. So either a and b are both negative, or a and b are both positive. And because the first equation makes b negative, we know that a must also be negative. Since a and b are both negative, we know that ab = -10. So we can say b = -10/a.\nIn terms of our system, we can say that 5a - 10/a = 0. So this can be simplified to 5a^2 - 10 = 0 or 5a^2 = 10.
