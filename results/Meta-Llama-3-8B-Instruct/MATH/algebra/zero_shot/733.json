        " \nFirst, let\u2019s set up the function $x$ that describes the revenue of the bookstore. The revenue is equal to the price of the book, which is $p$, multiplied by the number of books sold, which is $120-3p$. Therefore, $x = p(120-3p) = 120p-3p^2$. The function $x$ is the revenue.\nWe can write the function in the form of $x = a-bp^2 + cp-d$.\nTo find the price $p$ that maximizes revenue, we use calculus. The revenue function is $x = 120p-3p^2$.\nTo find the maximum revenue, we set the derivative of $x$ with respect to $p$ equal to zero. We find that $\\frac{dx}{dp} = 120-6p$. To find the maximum revenue, we set the derivative equal to zero: $120-6p = 0 \\implies p = 20$.\nBut we have to test $p = 20$ in the original equation to confirm that this is the maximum. $\\frac{d^2x}{dp^2} = -6 < 0$, so $p = 20$ is a maximum.\nSo, the bookstore should charge $p = \\boxed{\\20}$ to maximize its revenue.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 20.

The revenue from the product's sales is given by $p(x)$ dollars per month. Find the value of $x$ that maximizes the revenue when $p$ is a parameter.\nSolution: Let's define the revenue function. Then, we have: $$r=p(x)=px.$$So, our function is $r = px$. The problem gives that $x \\ge 0$ and $p \\ge 0$, so we can find the critical points of $r$.\nLet's differentiate $r$ with respect to $x$:\n$$\\frac{dr}{dx}=p.$$The maximum revenue is found when $r$ is at its critical points. Thus, we need to solve $p=c$.\nNow, after we find the critical points, we need to check for them, which isn't necessary in this case, because our function is continuous within the domain given. Therefore, the value of $x$ that maximizes the revenue is simply $x = c$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is c. I hope it is correct. ",

The maximum value of a function given by a linear function occurs when its derivative is zero.  So, we first find the derivative of the function b = 120-3p, which is given by d/dp(b) = -3. To find the maximum of b in the interval 0 \\le p \\le 40, we set the derivative equal to zero and solve for p.  So,\n\\begin{align*}\n-3 &= 0\\\\\np &= 0\n\\end{align*}\nThis equation shows that the maximum value of b occurs at p = 0, but this solution is physically impossible since the price of the book cannot be less than zero.

        " \nLet's first find the total revenue generated by selling $x$ copies of the book at $p$ dollars each. The total revenue is $R=x\\cdot p$.\nGiven that the number of books sold per month is $120-3p$, we have $x=120-3p$. Substituting this value of $x$ into the total revenue formula, we get $R=p(120-3p)$.\nTo maximize the revenue, we need to take the derivative of $R$ with respect to $p$ and set it equal to zero.\n$$R=p(120-3p)=120p-3p^2$$\n$$R^\\prime=120-6p$$\n$$R^\\prime=0 \\Rightarrow 120-6p=0$$\n$$6p=120$$\n$$p=20$$",
        " \nStep 1: Determine the number of books sold per month\nIf the number of books sold per month is $120-3p$, this is a linear equation where $p$ is the price.\nStep 2: Determine the revenue\nThe revenue is the total cost of the books sold. The cost of each book is $p$, so the total cost is the number of books sold times the cost of each book. This is equal to $(120-3p)p$. Simplifying, this becomes $120p-3p^2$.\nStep 3: Determine the maximum revenue\nNow we need to find when $120p-3p^2$ is maximum. Using the power rule, the derivative of $120p-3p^2$ is $120-6p$. Setting this equal to $0$, we can find when the revenue is maximum. Solving $120-6p=0$, we get $p=20$. Plugging $p=20$ back into $120p-3p^2$, we can find the maximum revenue. $120(20)-3(20)^2=2400-1200=1200$.\nSo the store should charge $20$ dollars to maximize its revenue. Final Answer: The final answer is 20.

        " \nThe store's revenue in a month is the product of the number of books sold and the price. Based on this information, the store's revenue is\n$$R(p) = p(120-3p)=120p-3p^2.$$This is a quadratic function and for a quadratic function to be maximized, the derivative should be set to 0.\n$$R'(p)=120-6p=0.$$If you solve for $p$ now, you will find that $p = 20$. This is the most profitable price for the book.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 20. I hope it is correct.  ANOTHER SOLUTION Let's set up an equation for revenue as a function of price, $p$:\n$$R(p)=p(120-3p) = -3p^2+120p.$$We can then find the value of $p$ for which this function is maximized by finding its first derivative and setting it equal to zero:\n$$R'(p)=-6p+120=0\\Rightarrow p=\\boxed{20}$$, which is the maximum price for which revenue is a function of price. Then the maximum revenue is 20 * (120 - 3 * 20) = 400. I hope it is correct.  ANSWER  The first solution is more efficient as it eliminates the need for a second step by setting up the derivative and solving for $p$.  If we plug in the value of $p = 20$ back into the revenue equation, we have that the maximum revenue is $R(20) = 20(120 - 3 \\cdot 20) = 20 \\cdot 40 = \\boxed{\\ 800}$.

        " Revenue from selling $p$ books is $120p-3p^2$.  \nThe amount of revenue when the bookstore sells the book at price $p$ (penalty $k$ to include the cases) is $R = 120p - 3p^2$. We want to determine the specific $p$ value at which this function is maximized and has $p \\le 40$. Now, find $f'(p)=120-6p$.\n### ",
        " If the store charges $p$ for the book, then its profit per day is $(120-3p)\\cdot p = 120p-3p^2$. The store\u2019s revenue per day is $120p-3p^2$ for all $p\\leq 40$, so we want to maximize $f(p)=120p-3p^2$ over the interval $[0,40]$.\nWe know that $f(p)=120p-3p^2$ is the quadratic function with $a=-3$, $b=120$, and $c=0$. Since the $a$-coefficient is negative, its graph is concave down. Therefore, the vertex is the maximum. $p=\\frac{-b}{2a}=\\frac{-120}{2\\cdot(-3)}=20$, the vertex is the maximum, so the store should charge $\\boxed{20}$ dollars per book to maximize its revenue. ### Final Answer: The final answer is 20. I hope it is correct.  Final Answer: The final answer is 20. I hope it is correct. ---- #### Solution 2:If $x$ is the price charged, then the revenue is $x(120-3x) = 120x - 3x^2$. This is the equation of a parabola with a minimum. Since we want the maximum, we set the first derivative to be zero and solve. $$\\frac{d}{dx}(120x-3x^2)=120-6x=0\\Rightarrow x=20.$$ This is the value that maximizes the revenue.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 20. I hope it is correct. #### Solution 3: The revenue is 120p-3p^2, in dollars. Since revenue is the price times the number of books sold, the units are correct. p must be less than or equal to 40, the price. To maximize the revenue, we need to maximize the revenue function 120p-3p^2. The function is the equation of the parabola with vertices at (20, 400) and (20,400). The parabola opens downwards, so the maximum is at 20. The price to charge is $ 20$. #0\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 20. I hope it is correct. Publication: MathCounts ShowMe Solution. ### ",
        " #### Write as a function.\nLet $p$ be the book\u2019s price. Then $r(p) = p(120-3p)$ is the revenue, which is a function of the book\u2019s price. We can graph this function: [Solving: The maximum of $r(p) = p(120-3p)$ occurs when $p = \\boxed{20}$.]\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 20. I hope it is correct. ### Write as a function. Let $p$ be the book\u2019s price. Then $r(p) = p(120-3p)$ is the revenue, which is a function of the book\u2019s price. Relevant equations:\n$R(p)=p(120-3p)$\nLet $p$ be the book\u2019s price. This formula calculates the revenue, $R(p)$, which is a function of the book\u2019s price. I hope it is correct."
