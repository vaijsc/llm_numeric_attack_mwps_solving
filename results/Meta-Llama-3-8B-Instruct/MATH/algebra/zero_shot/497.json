        " This problem can be easily handled by way of proportion. In 1 hour, Wonder Woman can capture 6 criminals. Therefore, in $x$ hours, we can capture $6\\cdot x/1=6x$ criminals.

        " We need to convert 4.5 hours to hours. It becomes $4\\frac{1}{2}=4.5=4+0.5=4+\\frac{1}{2}=4+\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 3=4+1.5=5$. So in $5$ hours, she can capture $\\boxed{5\\cdot6=30}$ criminals.\nAnother solution: This is another solution instead of using formula, to convert 4.5 hours to 5 hours we can add 1 extra hour while reducing the number of criminals captured in that extra hour. $6/1=30/5$ reduced by 30/5 you get $6/5=12$. So in $4.5$ hours, she can capture $6+12=18$ criminals. More intuitive you can say in $5$ hours, she can capture $6$ in each hour, then in $5$ hours, she can capture $6+6+6+6+6=30$ criminals.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 30. I hope it is correct. ",

I hope it is correct.\u03b3\u03b7\u03b7\n### Explanation:\nThis problem asks how many criminals Wonder Woman can capture in $4\\frac{1}{2}$ hours. In the problem statement, it says she can capture 6 criminals in an hour, so let\u2019s multiply this by the number of hours she has to capture them. We have\n$6\\cdot4=24$ and\n$24+6=\\boxed{30}$.\n### Variation 1:\nIt says that she can get 30 in $5$ hours. In $4\\frac{1}{2}$ hours, that is\n$\\frac{5}{1}\\cdot30=\\frac{30}{2}=15$ in $2$ hours and then add the $6$, so that is\n$15+6=21$. That is wrong. Or I can use $4\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot2=9$, multiply by $3$, and add $3$ to get\n$27+2=29$. No. Or\n$\\boxed{\\pi=10}$. Etc.\n### Variation 2:\nFrom the equation we come up with\n$\\frac{\\text{# of criminals to capture}}{\\text{length of time, in hours}}\\cdot \\text{length of time, in hours}=\\text{# of criminals captured}$\nWe can also get the equation $\\frac{6t}{1}=n$.\n### Variation 3:\nFrom $6x=30$ you can get $x=5$. This is false because I said she captures $6$ per hour. Now you should know that if you don\u2019t read the instructions, then you will get something funny.\n### Variation 4:\nI need to third what will happen at 4: 30 minutes to an hour. You can look up $4.\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{3}{2}=\\frac{6}{4}$\n### Variation 5:\nThis can be manipulated the following way:\n![](../assets/do-not-distribute/0.png)\nThis gives a minimum time.

        " Wonder Woman can capture 6 criminals in one hour, so in 4.5 hours, she can capture $4.5 \\cdot 6 = \\boxed{27}$ criminals.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 27. I hope it is correct. \u06a9\u0645\u06cc \u062f\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u0645! (Come on!) If Wonder Woman can capture 6 criminals in an hour, we can calculate how many she can capture in $4\\frac{1}{2}$ hours by multiplying 6 by the number of hours: $4.5 \\times 6 = 27$. Isn\u2019t that easy? Let me remind you how calculating time works. We multiply the number of hours we want to find by the number of hours she has already captured in one hour. We then multiply by 6 since she captures 6 each hour. Now, we need to practice converting mixed numbers into decimals to work with our calculations. Let\u2019s calculate $4\\frac{1}{2}$ hours. We have $4$ whole hours and $0.5$ hours. To make $0.5$ into a decimal, we multiply $0.5$ by $6$, which is equal to $3$. So now we have $4 + 3$ which is $7.$ We are going to multiply the total number of hours, which is $7$, by $6$ to get our answer. $7 \\times 6 = 42.$ I hope this clarifies everything! If you still have a question, please let me know. Thanks! If Wonder Woman can capture 6 criminals in an hour, then she can capture 6 + 9 + 12 = 27 in 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, and 4.5 hours respectively. When there are 4.5 hours to capture the 27 criminals, she can place all the criminals with the 24 hours of the day (the rate of capture is not changing). The lost time is $24-4.5=19.5$ hours so wonder woman can capture 6*3.25 = 19.5 = 20 in 4.5 hours. We have a two-step problem. First, we have to find the equivalent decimal by changing the mixed number into a decimal. In this case, we have a mixed number of 4.5 hours. So we have 4 whole hours and 0.5 hours. If that is the case, we multiply the 0.5 hours by 6 (",

        " Suppose the Wonder Woman can capture $6$ people in $1$ hours. Then, in $4\\frac{1}{2}$ hours, she will capture $6\\cdot 4.5=27$ people.\nLet\u2019s go step by step and explain what is happening here:\n1. Assume that 6 people were captured in 1 hour.\n2. We know that 1 hour is 1 unit of time. So, 6 people were captured in 1 unit.\n3. What about 2 units of time? 6 people can also be captured in 2 units. (2 units of time represent 2 hours)\n4. The question is asking about 4.5 units of time. We are asked to calculate 4.5 units, not 1 unit or 2 units.\n5. For each additional unit, the total amount of people captured by Wonder Woman will be the same as in the previous unit.\n6. Therefore, for 4.5 units of time, 6 x 4.5 = 27 people can be captured.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 27. I hope it is correct.  I will give credit for 6.

Can you imagine the scene where Wonder Woman fighting for justice with her magic lasso, and in 4.5 hours, she has caught many bad guys? Each hour is passing and there are more bad guys being caught. Then, the time passes and Wonder Woman is strong enough to catch 6 more bad guys. This is not repeated for each hour, but the strength does not decrease.

        " Final Answer: The final answer is 33. I hope it is correct. If Wonder Woman can capture 6 criminals in an hour, she will capture $\\frac{6}{1}$ = $6$ = $30$ criminals in $2$ hours. Then in the 2.5 hours remaining, she will capture an additional $2.5\\div2$ times $30$ = $37.5$. In total, she will capture $30+37.5$ = $\\boxed{33}$ criminals.\n## Discussion:\nThe first thing we did was identify the amount of criminals needed in one hour, which was 6. With this information, we can calculate the amount of criminals captured over a two hour period. $6 \\times 2$ = 12. Then, we deduced that for 2.5 hours, the percentage should be $2.5\\div2$ = $1.25$ more than the amount captured over a 2 hour period. The amount captured over a 2 hour period is 30. Now we can calculate the amount captured over 2.5 hours. As we mentioned earlier, the amount captured is $30 \\times 1.25$ = 37.5. The final amount is 30 + 37.5 = 67.5. If we round it to the nearest whole number, we get 33.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 33. I hope it is correct.

        " In $1$ hour, she captures $6$ criminals.  If we multiply this by $4$ to get $4$ hours, she captures $6\\cdot4=24$ criminals.  To find the number of criminals captured in an additional $1/2$ hour, we multiply $6$ by $1/2$, which is $3$.  Therefore, in $4\\frac{1}{2}$ hours, Wonder Woman captures $24+3=\\boxed{27}$ criminals.\nAn alternative solution can be given in terms of rates.  In one hour, Wonder Woman capture $6$ criminals.  To find the number of criminals captured in $4\\frac{1}{2}$ hours, we must multiply the rate at which she captures by the time:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Rate}&=6\\text{ criminals/hour}\\cdot 9/2\\text{ hours}\\\\\n&=27\\text{ criminals/time}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad&\\boxed{27}\\text{ criminals in }4\\frac{1}{2}\\text{ hours}.\n\\end{align*}Here we used $\\text{rate}=\\text{amount exchanged by unit of time}$.  This is the same as solving the equation \\begin{align*}\n6r&=27\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad r&=27/6=4.5\n\\end{align*}which also gives us the same answer.\nExcellent solution!  It does indeed prove that Wonder Woman will capture 27 criminals in $4\\frac{1}{2}$ hours.  It\u2019s also a good example of how rates can be used to solve problems involving time and conversion between units of time.",
