However, doing so involves a fair amount of computation with complex numbers and square roots, so we look for an alternative approach. We square the second equation to get $(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = 25$, which is close to what we want but has the extra $2ab$ term. Since we know that $ab=7$, we can substitute to get $$a^2 + 2(7) +b^2 = 25 \\Longrightarrow a^2+b^2 = \\boxed{11}.$$",

        " \nIf we multiply $a + b = 5$ by $a-b$, we obtain $a^2 - ab + b^2 = 5(a-b)$.\nThis expression can be factored into $(a-b)(a+b) - ab = 5(a-b)$ as follows:\n$5(a-b) = a^2 + b^2 - ab$.\nNote that $ab = 7$. Therefore, we can replace $ab$ by $7$, which yields:\n$5(a-b) = a^2 + b^2 - 7$.\nThis equation simplifies to $a^2 + b^2 = 5(a-b) + 7$ or in other words, $a^2 + b^2 = 5(a - b) + 7$.\nFinally, we can use $ab = 7$ and $a + b = 5$ to solve for $a-b$. We have\n\\begin{align*}\n5(a-b) + 7 &= a^2 + b^2 \\\\\n-5(a-b) &= a^2 + b^2 - 5(a-b) - 7 \\\\\n-5(a-b) &= (a-b)(a+b) - ab \\\\\n-5(a-b) &= (a+b)(a-b) - 7 \\\\\n-5(a-b) &= 5(a-b) - 7\n\\end{align*}\nSo, we can make sense of this question by separating $a$ and $b$.

Doing some problems above we found out $a+b = 5$ and $ab = 7$.\nWe can solve $a$ and $b$ using substitution.

        " First we can solve for $a$ and $b$. To do that, we need to get rid of one of $a$ and $b$. One substitution gives $a=5-b$. Then substitute this into the other equation, and we will get $$(5-b)b=7\\Rightarrow 5b-b^2=7\\Rightarrow b^2-5b+7=0,$$which can be expanded as $$(b-1)(b-7)=0.$$ This tells us that $b=1$ or $b=7$. The previous substitution then says $a=4$ or $a=5$. We know that $b\\neq0$, since the multiplication in the first equation gives a nonzero answer. Hence, $b=1\\neq7$. Then $a=4$.

An alternative approach might be to use the identity $${(a+b)}^2=a^2+2ab+b^2$$\nto re-express the equation of $ab=7$ in terms of $a^2$, $b^2$, and $a+b$.  Doing so gives us\n$${(a+b)}^2=a^2+2ab+b^2=a^2+2(7)+b^2.$$\nSolving $a+b=5$ for $a$ then gives $$a^2+2(7)+b^2=25$$\nor, after subtracting 25 from both sides, $$a^2+b^2=25-14=11.$$  Therefore, the alternative solution is that $a^2+b^2=\\boxed{11}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 11.

        " Firstly, we need to start by using the fact that $a+b = 5$ and rewriting it as $x = 5 - a$.\nThen we can substitute $x$ in with $b$ in $ab = 7$. That is $a(5 - a) = 7$. Expanding the brackets and distributing $a$ to the terms in the brackets, we get $5a - a^2 = 7$. Then, adding $a^2$ to both sides, we get $5a = a^2 + 7$. Then subtracting $a^2$ from both sides: $0 = a^2 - 5a + 7$. The Pythagorean triple $(a^2 - 5a + 7, a, 1)$ equates to aexpression of $(b^2 + 7, 5, 1)$ $\\boxed{b^2 = 7}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 7. I hope it is correct. Let me know if anything is wrong. I hope I'm done.  Just before closing, the question asks us to find $a^2 + b^2$. Since we know $b^2$ is $7$, it only leaves $a^2$ remaining: $a^2$. As we know $a^2 - 5a + 7 = 0$. Therefore, $a^2 - 5a + 4 = 3$ $a^2 - 5a + 4 = (a - 2)^2$. Combining the two $a^2$, we get $(a - 2)^2 + 7$. It only leaves $\\boxed{a^2 + b^2 = 7 + 4 = 11}$. Just think of it as using the Pythagorean triple again.\n### ",
        " Given that $$ab=7$$and$$a+b=5$$,let\u2019s try to factor $a^2+b^2$.$$a^2+b^2=(a+b)^2-2ab=5^2-2\\cdot7=25-14=11$$Therefore, $a^2+b^2$ is equal to $\\boxed{11}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 11.

        " We are given that $ab = 7$ and $a + b = 5$. Rearranging, we get that $b = 5 - a$. Now, we substitute this into the first equation to get $a(5 - a) = 7$, so $5a - a^2 = 7$. Finally, we add $a^2$ to both sides of the equation to obtain the equation $a^2 + 5a - 7 = 0$. The quadratic formula gives $a = \\frac{-5 \\pm \\sqrt{5^2 + 4 \\cdot 7}}{2} = \\frac{-5 \\pm \\sqrt{25 + 28}}{2} = \\frac{-5 \\pm \\sqrt{53}}{2}$. We will call this solution $a$. Now, we can use $b = 5 - a$ to derive the other solution for $b$.\n### Final Answer: The final answer is 28. I hope it is correct. 2020 17-1H 2021 10-1H 3\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 28.
