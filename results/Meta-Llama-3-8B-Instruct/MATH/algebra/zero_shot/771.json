        " To find the average speed of the run, you could calculate the total distance divided by the total time for the run.  The total distance is given as $1600$ meters, and the total time can be found by adding together the time it took her to run each segment separately.  Since the speed is given in meters per second, you can directly multiply the speed by the time to find the total distance for each segment.\n$$4.00 \\text{ m/s} \\times 400 \\text{ m} = 1600 \\text{ s}$$ $$4.00 \\text{ m/s} \\times 800 \\text{ m} = 3200 \\text{ s}$$ $$8.00 \\text{ m/s} \\times 400 \\text{ m} = 3200 \\text{ s}$$ Therefore, the total time for the run is $$1600 \\text{ s} + 3200 \\text{ s} + 3200 \\text{ s} = 8000 \\text{ s}$$ Once you have the total time, the average speed can be found by dividing the total distance by the total time.  The average speed in this case is $$1600 \\text{ m} / 8000 \\text{ s} = 0.2 \\text{ m/s}$$ since $1600 \\div 8000 = \\frac{1600}{8000} = \\frac{8}{40} = \\frac{1}{5} = 0.2$ Final Answer: The final answer is \\frac{1}{5}.

        " First, let\u2019s find total time taken by Melanie to run his complete $1600$ meters.\nMelanie took 400/5 = 80 seconds to run at 5m/s, which makes her distance traveled so far 80*5 = 400 meters. Then she took 800/4 = 200 seconds to run at 4m/s, which makes her total distance traveled so far 800 meters. Then she took 400/8 = 50 seconds to run at 8m/s, which makes her total distance traveled 1200 meters. So after running the complete 1600 meters, her total time taken is 80 + 200 + 50 = 330 seconds. So the AVspeed of Melanie is total distance / total time. AVspeed = 1600 / 330, which is 8/11 = \\boxed{4 \\frac{4}{11}}m/s\n### Editor\u2019s note: Another way to solve this problem is to use the formula $V_{avg}=\\frac{\\Delta s}{\\Delta t}$. In this case, $\\Delta s=1600\\ m$ and $\\Delta t=t_1+t_2+t_3$. We know that motion 1: $200\\ m$, $v_1=5\\ m/s$ so $\\Delta t_1=s_1/v_1=200/5=40\\ s$. Motion 2: $800\\ m$, $v_2=4\\ m/s$ so $\\Delta t_2=s_2/v_2=800/4=200\\ s$. Motion 3: $400\\ m$, $v_3=8\\ m/s$ so $\\Delta t_3=s_3/v_3=400/8=50\\ s$. Therefore, $\\Delta t=\\Delta t_1+\\Delta t_2+\\Delta t_3=40+200+50=290\\ s$. Then, using the formula $V_{avg}=\\frac{\\Delta s}{\\Delta t}=\\frac{1600}{290}=\\boxed{4 \\frac{4}{11}}\\ m/s$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 4 \\frac{4}{11}. I hope it is correct.

        " We first add together all of the distances she ran at each speed.\nWhen she ran at 5 m/s, she ran for 400 meters. The full distance would be $5\\cdot 400 = 2000$  meters. Similarly, when she ran at 4 m$s for 800 meters, she ran a full distance of $4\\cdot 800 = 3200$  meters. Finally, when she ran at 8 m/s for 400 meters, she ran a full distance of $8\\cdot 400 = 3200$  meters.  So, she ran a total distance of $2000+3200+3200=8400$ meters.  The length of the run is $1600$ meters, so the time it took her to run the full $1600$ meters is the time it took her to run all $8400$ meters divided by $8400$  meters.  The total time was $400/5+800/4+400/8=80+200+50=330$ seconds. So the average speed was $8400/330 \\approx 25.455$ m/s. Now, let\u2019s consider simplifying the fraction. We have 440/16, and we notice that 440 is divisible by 8, because 8 * 55 is 440. If we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 8, we get 55/2. The denominator 2 is composite because 1 times 2 is 2, and so the fraction can be simplified to 55/2, which equals 27.5.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 27.5. I hope it is correct.
