[credit: AoPS](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php?title=2002_AMC_10A_Problems/Problem_25) <hr>\nMy commentary: I added a step by step breakdown to make it easier to follow along. I also added a comment at the beginning about how it is important to break down the problem step by step, and provided a link to AoPS for a bit more detail on solving systems of equations. <hr>\nThis problem demonstrates that if you have a system of linear equations and you can add them together in some way to cancel out most of the variables, you can often find an easy solution. The same technique can be used to solve other systems of linear equations. This question is good for honing problem-solving skills and encouraging students to think creatively. <hr>\nI think this question would be a good problem for students around the 9th-11th grade level. The math is challenging enough, but not ridiculously hard. It\u2019s a great problem for students who are looking to solve systems of equations and need a bit more practice. <hr>\nI think this problem is very relevant to real life. Solving systems of linear equations comes up often in real life, from finance to science. Students will often encounter them in their future careers and this problem helps them build strong problem-solving skills. <hr>\nHow it relates to the course material is that it is showing how systems of linear equations can be used to solve real-world problems. This is a key concept in algebra II and is often taught earlier in the course. This problem is a great review for students who have learned about systems of linear equations and want to see them applied to a real-world problem. <hr>\nThis problem can be modified in a few different ways. For example, you could make it easier by reducing the numbers to simple integers (",

        " \nNotice that each line is a linear combination of $x$, $y$, and $z$, so after simplifying them, we can add each line together to make a matrix.\n\\begin{align*}\n3x &= 40 \\\\\n3z &= -8 \\\\\n\\end{align*} \nThis becomes: $x+y+z = 40$.\nNow, we can see that $x = 40-y-z$.\nSubstituting $x$ back into the first three equations gives $$(40-y-z)+y-(40-y-z) = 30$$ \nAnd stops. We can simplify that to get $-2z=20$, so $z = -10$. \nSince $x = 40-y-z$, then $x = 40-y+10 = 50 - y$, so $x$ is just 50 minus y.\nLastly, the third equation, $-x+y+z = 30$, simplifies to $$(50 - y)+y+(-10) = 30$$ \n$50 + (-20) = 30$. We can simplify to 30. This works out pretty simply to be $0$. By this point, we know $z$ is $-10$, but we really don\u2019t know $x$ or $y$, so we must exhibit absolutely no doubt about the price of $x$ or $y$, as they have to however. So I think there are limitless minimal factors, and also will be $4$. Plus $8$. Also will be $5$. Plus $6$. $0$ will be through $60$, but one at a time, needing $1$, $2$ units. \\begin{align*}\n\\text{All following: }xyz = (50-y)\\cdot y\\cdot(-10) &= -10y^2+50y \\\\\n&= -2y(5y-25)\\\\\n(for $y = 4$, $8$, $5$, $0$, from $x$, or $y$}\n\\end{align*}I found that out from x or y. \\begin{align*}\n-2(4)(-3) &= 24 \\\\\n-2(8)(7) &= -112 \\\\\n-2(5)(0) &= 0 \\\\\n-2(0)(x) &= 0\n\\end{align*}\nThis does mean $xyz = 24$.\nThe overall answer is: $4*4*5*",
        " This is my attempt to solve it:\n1. We can use the rules of 3 equations with 3 unknowns to solve for $x$, $y$, and $z$. Let me call $x+y-z=-8$ equation $(1)$; $x-y+z=18$ equation $(2)$; and $-x+y+z=30$ equation $(3)$.\n2. Adding equations $(1)$ and $(2)$ together and subtracting $(3)$ leaves us with $2y=40$. Dividing both sides by $2$, we get $y=20$.\n3. To find $x$, we can use either $(1)$ or $(2)$; we will use equation $(1)$ in this case. We substitute $y=20$ into the equation $(1)$ and then solve for $x$: $x+20-z=-8$, so $x-z=-28$.\n4. Now, we still need to find $z$. We can use equation $(2)$ in this case by substituting $y=20$ and solving for $z$; we get $x+20+z=18$, so $x+z=18$.\n5. We can now use the fact that we found $x-z=-28$ and $x+z=18$ to determine $x$. We know that $x-z=-28$ and $x+z=18$; combining these, we get $2x=-10$, so $x=-5$.\n6. Finally, we can evaluate $xyz$: $x =\", that is, $x = - 5$ . Therefore, $x y z = (- 5 ) \\cdot 20 \\cdot 13 = \\boxed{-1300} $.\nI hope it\u2019s correct! I\u2019ll be happy to correct myself if my solution is incorrect.",

        " We are given a system of equations. We write it down.\n\\begin{align*}\nx+y-z &= -8, \\\\\nx-y+z &= 18, \\\\\n-x+y+z &= 30. \\\\\n\\end{align*} We can try to find the value of $x$, $y$, and $z$. From the first equation we have\n$$x+y-z=-8 \\Rightarrow x+y=x+z+8 \\Rightarrow y=z+8.$$From the second equation we have\n$$x-y+z=18 \\Rightarrow x-(z+8)+z=18 \\Rightarrow x=10.$$From the third equation we have\n$$-x+y+z=30 \\Rightarrow -(10)+(z+8)+z=30 \\Rightarrow z=4.$$Finally we have $y=z+8=4+8=12$. Thus $x=10$, $y=12$, and $z=4$. We want to find the value of $xyz=(10)(12)(4)=\\boxed{480}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 480. I hope it is correct.  That\u2019s the solution !

        " To solve this problem, we first will add up all the equations to eliminate $x$:\n$$(-8) + 18 + 30 = -x+y+z = 40.$$ Then we know that $x+y-z = -8$, so by setting these two equations equal to each other, we can solve for $z$:  $$-8+40=y+z \\rightarrow z=32.$$  Now the second equation is $x-y+z=18$. By substituting in $z=32$ for $z$, we get: $$x-y+32=18 \\rightarrow x-y=-14.$$ The third equation is $-x+y+z=30$, by substituting in $z=32$ for $z$ and $x-y=-14$ for $x-y$, we get: $$14+y=30 \\rightarrow y=16.$$ Now with our values of $y$ and $z$, we know that $x+y-z=-8$. By substituting in $y=16$ and $z=32$ for $y$ and $z$, we get: $$x+16-32=-8 \\rightarrow x=-24.$$ Now we will multiply all the values together in order to find $x\\cdot y\\cdot z$: $$(x\\cdot y\\cdot z)=(-24\\cdot16\\cdot32)$$ $$=-1536.$$ Therefore, the value of $x y z$ is $\\boxed{-1536}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -1536.
