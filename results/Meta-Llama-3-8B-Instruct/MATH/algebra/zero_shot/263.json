        " Find the roots\nFirst, set $x^4=5x^2-6$ (we are looking for the points where these two functions intersect).\n### Solution: 1\nSimplifying the above equation, we can continue as follows:\n\\begin{align*}\nx^4-5x^2+6&=0\\\\\nx^2(x^2-5x+6)&=0\\\\\nx^2((x-1)^2-4x+6)&=0\\\\\n(x-1)^2(x^2-4x+6)&=0.\n\\end{align*} By the Zero-Product Property, we know that the equation has solutions only when $(x-1)^2=0$ or $(x^2-4x+6)=0$. The first possibility yields $x=1$, and the second possibility gives\n$$x^2-4x+6=(x-3)^2=0,$$which yields $x=3$.",
        "Step 1: Formulate the problem\nThe question is asking to find $m-n$, where $m > n$. We know that there are four points of intersection between $y=x^4$ and $y=5x^2-6$. Each such point has $x$-coordinate $\\pm \\sqrt{m}$ or $\\pm \\sqrt{n}$.\nStep 2: Understand the problem\nWe have two functions $y=x^4$ and $y=5x^2-6$ that intersect at four points. We need to find $m$ and $n$.\nWe can equate the two functions: $x^4=5x^2-6$ This is a quartic equation with degree 4.\nStep 3: Solve the equation\nWe can solve this equation by completing the square or using some other method. Let\u2019s try to complete the square. First, we can rewrite the equation as $x^4-5x^2+6=0$ Next, we can proceed by completing the square: $x^4-5x^2+6=(x^2-3)^2=0$ Hence, we have $(x^2-3)^2=0$. Taking the square root, we have $\\boxed{x^2=3\\Rightarrow x=\\pm\\sqrt{3}}$ This equation should yield two solutions: $\\sqrt{3}$ and $-\\sqrt{3}$, which match the given information.\n### Solution\nWe have already found that $x=\\pm\\sqrt{3}$ is a solution. Therefore, $m=3$. However, it could be that either $x=\\sqrt{3}$ or $x=-\\sqrt{3}$ would give us different $m$ and $n$. Let\u2019s check that: If $x=\\pm\\sqrt{3}$ then $y=(\\pm\\sqrt{3})^4=3^2=9$, while we have $y=5(\\pm\\sqrt{3})^2-6=5\\cdot3-6=3$, so $m=3$ and $n=3$. However, if $x=\\sqrt{3}$ then the $x$-coordinates are respectively $\\sqrt{3}$ and $-\\sqrt{3}$, which means that $m=\\boxed{3}$ and $n=3$.\nThe answer is $m-n=3-3=\\boxed{0}$. I hope it is correct",
        "Firstly, set the two functions equal to each other, and solve for x:\n\\begin{align*} x^4&=5x^2-6\\\\\n\\Rightarrow x^4-5x^2+6&=0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow (x^2-1)(x^2-6)&=0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow x^2-1&=0\\qquad\\text{or}\\qquad x^2-6=0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow x&=\\pm1\\qquad\\text{or}\\qquad x=\\pm\\sqrt{6}\n\\end{align*}\nSo, the $x$-coordinates of the intersection points are $\\pm1$ and $\\pm\\sqrt{6}$.",
