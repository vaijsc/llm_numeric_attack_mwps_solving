        " $f(8) = 3\\sqrt{2(8) - 7} - 8 = 3\\sqrt{14} - 8$\n#### Correct\nHere we are given an example of a function. The question asks us to find the output value of the function. To do this, we simply substitute the value given into the function and solve for $f(8)$.\nThe function in this case is f(x) = 3\\sqrt{2x - 7} - 8. Plugging in x=8, we have f(8) = 3\\sqrt{2(8)-7}-8.\nWe apply the order of operations (note: the square root is part of the multiplication in this case) and put the number in the square root in parentheses for clarity: f(8)=3\u221a(2(8)-7)-8.\nNow we follow the order of ops and multiply 2 and 8. The exponent, or the letter it is next to, is sent down to the level of operation. So we have f(8)=3\u221a(16-7)-8 = 3\u221a9-8.\nThe square root of a perfect square always simplifies to the square root of that number (by definition).  In this case, 9 is the square of 3. So the square root of 9 simplifies to 3. f(8)= 3(3)-8.\nWe follow orders of operations again. We start with the parentheses.  Inside the parentheses, we multiply 3 and 3. Then we subtract 8: 3(3)-8=9-8.\nFinally, we see 9-8. When we subtract 8 from 9, we get 1. So the final answer is f(8) = 1. 3\\sqrt{14} - 8 = 1.

We need the expression with respect to 8.\n### Final Answer: The final answer is $f(8) = 3\\sqrt{16-7} - 8 = 3\\sqrt{9} - 8 = 3 \\cdot 3 - 8 = 9 - 8 = \\boxed{1}$\nI hope it is correct.  Let me know if you have any further questions.  These things are just straightforward but all problems require\nprocessing. If I am making any mistake, please do not hesitate to point it out.\nIf I am in the right road, have the correct answer, then we can go to step 2 which is for another\nanalysis or a further reflection of the questions and the results.\n### Step 2: Discussion and Analysis\nHere, we compare the question and the result.  We need to know what information we can draw out the result.\nWhat conclusion can we draw from the result?  How does this result strengthen or weaken our\nunderstanding of the function f or the expression $f(x)$?  What other conclusions or insights can we\ndraw?\n### Final Discussion: The final discussion of the result can lead to a new conclusion that if we give any\ninput to this function, it will always give an output of either 1, that is, the result of\n$f(8)$ is 1.  And having that fact, we can see that this function is not varying with any input values.  It\nis always giving 1.  We could say that such a function is a constant function, that shows\nno variation in its outputs.\nIf we relate this concept to real life scenarios, then a constant function could represent something\nthat doesn\u2019t change over time.  Like a constant speed of 1 meter per second can be represented by a\nconstant function.\nThe answer is positive because constant functions are always positive.  It is consistent. In the context of real life, constant functions can have positive, negative or constant",
        " To find $f(8)$, we must evaluate the expression $f(x)$ with $x = 8$.\nTo do so, we have $f(8) = 3\\sqrt{2(8) - 7} - 8 = 3\\sqrt{14 - 7} - 8 = 3\\sqrt{7} - 8 = 3\\sqrt{4 \\cdot \\frac{7}{4}} - 8 = 3 \\cdot 2\\sqrt{\\frac{7}{4}} - 8 = \\boxed{6\\sqrt{\\frac{7}{4}} - 8}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 6\\sqrt{\\frac{7}{4}} - 8. I hope it is correct.  Please let me know if you need any further help.  \n",
        " (A sufficient solution)\nWe are given that $f(x) = 3\\sqrt{2x - 7} - 8$.  To find $f(8)$, we will evaluate this expression when $x = 8$.  In other words, we will substitute $x = 8$ into the equation:\n\\begin{align*}\nf(x) &= 3\\sqrt{2x - 7} - 8\\\\\nf(8) &= 3\\sqrt{2(8) - 7} - 8 = 3\\sqrt{9} - 8\\\\\n&= 3(3) - 8 = 9 - 8 = \\boxed{1}.\n\\end{align*}",
        " First, I find the value of $x$ that makes the argument of the $\\sqrt{\u2026}$ zero.\nWe know $2x-7=0$, so $x=7/2$. This means $f(7/2)$ is the zero value, that is, $0$.\n### ",
        " f(8)=3\\sqrt{2\\cdot8-7}-8=3\\sqrt{14}-8\n#### Hint: Notice that in the expression $3\\sqrt{2\\cdot8-7}-8$, we are given all the required values and we just need to apply them.\n#### Answer: 3\\sqrt{14}-8=\\boxed{-2}\nWe are asked to find $f(8)$. Therefore, we substitute 8 in the given function. After substituting, we simplify and get -2."
