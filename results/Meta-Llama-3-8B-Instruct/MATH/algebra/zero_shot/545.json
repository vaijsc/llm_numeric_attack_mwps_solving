        "  To solve this, we can start by using the given information $x^2 + 1 = 7x$, then we move all the terms to the left side of the equation $x^2 - 7x + 1 = 0$, since both $x$ and $x^2$ are linear in terms of root. To solve this, we must look for a quadratic equation. The way to do that is to use the quadratic formula as follows:\n$$x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$\nBy setting our value of $a=1, b=-7$ and $c=1$ in the formula we obtain:\n$$x = \\frac{7 \\pm \\sqrt{(-7)^2 - 4*1*1}}{2*1}$$\n$$x = \\frac{7 \\pm \\sqrt{49 - 4}}{2}$$\n$$x = \\frac{7 \\pm \\sqrt{45}}{2}$$\n$$x = \\frac{7 \\pm 3\\sqrt{5}}{2}$$\nSo, we have two values of $x$. \n$$x_1 = \\frac{7 + 3\\sqrt{5}}{2}$$\n$$x_2 = \\frac{7 - 3\\sqrt{5}}{2}$$\nNow, if we want to find sum of $x$ and its reciprocal, it means sum of $x$ and $\\frac{1}{x}$. Therefore, we have:\n$$x + \\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{x^2 + 1}{x}$$\nWe can find the sum of $x$ and its reciprocal by using one of the solutions. So, let\u2019s use $x_1 = \\frac{7 + 3\\sqrt{5}}{2}$. Substitute it into the equation and we obtain:\n$$x_1 + \\frac{1}{x_1} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{7 + 3\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right)^2 + 1}{\\left(\\frac{7 + 3\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right)}$$\nIt is cumbersome to solve this. After doing it by hand, we get the following result:\n$$x_1 + \\frac{1}{x_1} = 3 + ",

I hope it is correct.  ### Answer Explanation: This particular problem is a good example of overcomplication. We can notice that $0^2+1 \\neq 7 \\cdot 0$ , $1^2+1 \\neq 7 \\cdot 1$ , so $x = 0$ and $x = 1$ do not work. The only possible values are $x = 2$ and $x = -5$ . By plugging these values into the given equation, we can quickly see $x = \\boxed{2}$ is the only working solution. Then the sum is simply $x + \\frac{1}{x} = 2 + \\frac{1}{2} = \\boxed{\\frac{5}{2}}$ . Of course, the most straightforward way is to solve the equation $x^2+1=7x$ . Since $x^2-7x+1=(x-2)(x-5)$ , we are left with $x-2=0$ , meaning $x=\\boxed{2}$ . The final answer is still $\\frac{5}{2}$ . I hope it helps!  Tagging @Lily, @Hank.

Then, I will calculate the sum of $x$ and its reciprocal.\nLet\u2019s think step by step.\n\\begin{align*}\nx^2+1&=7x\\\\\nx^2-7x+1&=0\n\\end{align*}\nThis is a quadratic equation. To solve it, I would factor.\n\\begin{align*}\n(x-1)(x-8)&=0\\\\\nx-1&=0\\quad\\text{or}\\quad x-8=0\\\\\nx&=1\\quad\\text{or}\\quad x=8\n\\end{align*}\nOnly $x=1$ makes sense since we are dealing with reciprocals, so that is the solution.\n$x$ is a solution to $x^2+1=7x$, so we have $x=1$.\nThe sum of $x$ and its reciprocal is $\\boxed{2}$.\nAlternative solution:\nThis one is for those who remember the quadratic formula.\nLet\u2019s think step by step.\n\\begin{align*}\nx^2+1&=7x\\\\\nx^2-7x+1&=0\n\\end{align*}\nThis is a quadratic equation. To solve it, we can use the quadratic formula.\n\\begin{align*}\nx&=\\frac{-(-7)\\pm\\sqrt{(-7)^2-4(1)(1)}}{2(1)}\\\\\nx&=\\frac{7\\pm\\sqrt{49-4}}{2}\\\\\nx&=\\frac{7\\pm\\sqrt{45}}{2}\\\\\nx&=\\frac{7\\pm3\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\\\\n\\end{align*}\nHowever, we know from our first solution that we should get $x=1$ and this does not give that. Therefore, there\u2019s something wrong.\nThis is the reason why we should have been more careful in our alternative solution. Recall that any quadratic can be written in the form $y=ax^2+bx+c$ for some real numbers $a$, $b$, and $c$.\nFactor $x^2-bx+c$ if possible. Otherwise, use the quadratic formula.\nIn this example, the quadratic equation was factorable.\nNote that we should have noticed that $-7$ and $1$ have the same sign.\n$\\",
        " We are given that $x$ is a solution to $x^2 + 1 = 7x$. Subtracting $7x$ and adding $49$ on both sides, we have\n$$x^2-7x+48=0.$$Factoring this equation, we get\n$$(x-8)(x-6)=0.$$This implies that either $x-8=0$, which gives $x=8$, or $x-6=0$, which gives $x=6$. If $x=8$, then $\\frac{1}{x}=\\frac{1}{8}$, and if $x=6$, then $\\frac{1}{x}=\\frac{1}{6}$. In both cases, the sum of $x$ and its reciprocal is $x+\\frac{1}{x}=\\boxed{8\u00bd}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 8 \\frac{1}{2}.
