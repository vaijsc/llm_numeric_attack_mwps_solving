The mean is worked out by adding up the numbers and dividing by the amount of numbers. For example, if we took the average of the following table: -2, 1, 4, 1, 5 the mean would be worked out by adding together -2 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 5 and dividing by the number of numbers - 5. This gives a mean of ((-2) + 1 + 4 + 1 + 5) / 5, which is 3/5 = 0.6.

The average of these 250 numbers is the sum divided by the number of terms.\nHere, the sum of the numbers is 125 * (250 + 1), which is 125 * 251 = 31,375. The average is 31,375 / 250. We can compute this to find the answer to the nearest tenth: 31,375 / 250 = 125.5.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 125.5. I hope it is correct. Let me know if you need anything else.
