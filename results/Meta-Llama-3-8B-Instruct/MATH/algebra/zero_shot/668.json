        " [cs + p]^2 + q\nStep 1: Factor the quadratic $4s^2 + 28s + 45$ into the form $(cs + p)^2 + q$.\nStep 2: Classify the quadratic. The discriminant is $28^2 - 4(4)(45) = 0$, so the quadratic factors completely.\nStep 3: Try easy factoring by guessing a suitable value for $(cs + p)^2$. Looking at the constant term $45$, we see that $45 = 1^2 + 4^2$. Therefore, we can\u2019t have $(cs)^2$ in the factorization because the constant term $1$ would drop out, but we do have a contribution of $(cs)^2$. Therefore, suppose that our factorization is $(cs + p)^2 + q = (cs + 1)^2 + 45$, which can be written as the full expansion $(cs)^2 + 2(cs)(1) + 1^2 + 45$. Equating coefficients, we see that $c = 4$, giving the full expression $(4s + 1)^2 + 45$.\nStep 4: Locate $q$. We can read off that $q = \\boxed{45}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 45.

Remember that factoring quadratics can involve trial and error, and you may need to try different combinations of values before you find one that works. In this case, the fact that the constant term $45$ has a perfect square decomposition $(1^2 + 4^2)$ made it easy to identify a suitable value for $(cs + p)^2$, while the vanishing discriminant helped to rule out other possible factors.

Therefore, we can also write $4s^2 + 28s + 45 = (cs + p)^2 + q$ as $\\boxed{(2s)^2 + 28s + 45 = (2s)^2 + 28s + 45}$",
        "\\\nWe want to rewrite $4s^2 + 28s + 45$ as $(cs + p)^2 + q$.

        " We want the expression in the form of $(cs+p)^2+q$. We know that $(cs+p)^2 = c^2 s^2+ 2cs p+ p^2$. Therefore, we are looking for $c$, $p$, such that\n$4s^2+2(4s) p+p^2+q = 4s^2+28s+45.$\nNext, we equate the coefficients of $s^2$ (the quadratic term) and we get $4+2cp=p^2$. This gives us\n\\begin{align*}\n2c p &= p^2-4 \\\\\npc &= \\frac{p^2-4}{2} \\\\\nc&= \\frac{p^2-4}{2p}.\n\\end{align*}\nUsing $cs+ p = 4s^2 +28s+45$, we have\n$2cs +2p = 8s^2+56s+45 = 8s^2+56s+49+45-49 = 4s^2+28s+45.$ Since $cs+p$ is the quadratic expression, then $2cs+2p$ will be the constant term of this expression. This implies that $2cp=28$. From the equation we derived above, we get $p^2-4=28$. Thus, we have\n$$p^2=32\\Longrightarrow p=\\pm 4\\sqrt{2}.$$Let\u2019s now assume that $p=4\\sqrt{2}$. We get\n$$c = \\frac{p^2-4}{2p} = \\frac{(4\\sqrt{2})^2-4}{2 \\cdot 4 \\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{16-4}{8\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{12}{8\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{3}{2 \\sqrt{2}}.$$\nTherefore, our quadratic is $(\\frac{3}{2 \\sqrt{2}}s + 4\\sqrt{2})^2 = 4s^2+28s+45$.
