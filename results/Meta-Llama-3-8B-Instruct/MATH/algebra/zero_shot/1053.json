        "To solve the given system of equations for \\( c \\), we start by rewriting the equations:\n1. \\( a - b = 2(c + d) \\)\n2. \\( b = a - 2 \\)\n3. \\( d = c + 5 \\)\nFirst, we substitute equation 2 into equation 1. Substituting \\( b = a - 2 \\) into equation 1 gives us:\n\\[\na - (a - 2) = 2(c + d)\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n2 = 2(c + d)\n\\]\nDividing both sides by 2:\n\\[\n1 = c + d\n\\]\nNow, we have a new equation:\n\\[\nc + d = 1 \\quad \\text{(Equation 4)}\n\\]\nNext, we can use equation 3 which states \\( d = c + 5 \\). We substitute this expression for \\( d \\) into equation 4:\n\\[\nc + (c + 5) = 1\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n2c + 5 = 1\n\\]\nNow, we solve for \\( c \\):\n1.

We can express \\( a \\) in terms of \\( b \\):\nFrom equation 1, \\( a - b = 2(c + d) \\):\nSubstituting \\( c = -2 \\) and \\( d = 3 \\):\n\\[\na - b = 2(-2 + 3) = 2 \\times 1 = 2\n\\]\nUsing equation 2, \\( b = a - 2 \\):\nSubstituting \\( b \\) back into \\( a - b = 2 \\) gives us:\n\\[\na - (a - 2) = 2\n\\]\nThis is true:\n\\[\n2 = 2\n\\]\nNow again check \\( a \\) through equations.
