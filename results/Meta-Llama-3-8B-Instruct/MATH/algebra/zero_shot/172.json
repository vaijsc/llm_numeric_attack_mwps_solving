        " First, we can combine the like terms in the given quadratic equation:\n$$x^2-7x-30=0.$$We know that $x^2-ax-b=0$ is a quadratic equation of the form $(x+p)(x+q)=0$.  The sum of $p$ and $q$ is $a$, and the product of $p$ and $q$ is $b$.  In this case, $a=7$, so $p+q=7$.  Therefore, the two solutions are $p$ and $q$.  If $p$ is the positive solution, then $q$ is the negative solution.\nThe equation $x^2-7x-30=0$ factors as $(x+3)(x-10)=0$.  The positive solution is $x=10$, and the negative solution is $x=-3$.  Therefore, the difference between the positive solution $x=10$ and the negative solution $x=-3$ is $10-(-3)=\\boxed{13}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 13. I hope it is correct.### ",

        " \nWe first need to put all the constants on the right hand side of the equation.  Adding $-4x$ to both sides of the equation, we have $$x^2 - 8x - 30 = 0.$$We then need to find two real numbers $r_{1}, r_{2}$ that satisfy the quadratic equation above.  Thus, we write the equation as $(x-r_{1})(x-r_{2})=0.$  Expanding the right hand side of this equation, we have $$x^{2}-r_{1}x-xr_{2}+r_{2}x-r_{1}r_{2}=0.$$We want the coefficients of $x^{2}$ in both equations to be the same.  Thus, we have $$r_{1}r_{2}=-30.$$We also want the constant terms in both equations to be the same.  Since the constant term in the equation $x^{2}-8x-30=0$ is $-30$, we have $$-r_{1}r_{2}=-30 \\Rightarrow r_{1}r_{2}=30.$$The sum of the roots of a quadratic equation is equal to the opposite of the coefficient of $x$ divided by the coefficient of $x^{2}.$  Thus, we have $$r_{1}+r_{2}=\\frac{-(-8)}{1}=8.$$The product of the roots is 30.  We want a sum of 8.  So, we choose $r_{1}=6, r_{2}=2$ using the quadratic formula, and we get the same product as we did using the equation $(x-2)(x-6).$  The positive difference between the two solutions is $$r_{2}-r_{1}=2-6=\\boxed{4}.$$The final answer is 4.

I hope it is correct. ### Matching the answers with process flow, the following problem does nothing.  The quadratic $x^2-4x-14=3x+16$ has two solutions.  What is the positive difference between these solutions?  The only thing different here are the coefficients, and the problem is too lengthy to go through in more detail.  I just prove here, given $ax^2+bx+c=0$ has solutions $x_1$ and $x_2$, it knows $x_1+x_2=-\\frac{b}{a}$ and $x_1x_2=\\frac{c}{a}$.  We know the given equation $x^2-4x-14=3x+16$ has been transformed into $x^2-7x-30=0$.  Using the formula above we know $x_1+x_2=-(-7)/1=7$ and $x_1x_2=(-30)/(1)=30$.  But we don\u2019t know yet $x_1$ and $x_2$ and their signs.  Based on $x_1x_2=30$, one pair is positive and another is negative.  We see that the product of two negative numbers is also negative.  There are three pairs.  So it possible to try these three $x$-values to get $x^2-7x-30$: \n$x=1, (1-7)(1+3)=-38$\n$x=3, (3-7)(3+3)=-12$\n$x=2, (2-7)(2-15)=34$ \nThe only one positive is $x= 2$, which means one of $x_1$ and $",
