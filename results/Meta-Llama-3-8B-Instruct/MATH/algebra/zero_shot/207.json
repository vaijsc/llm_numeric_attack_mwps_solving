The terms \\(4\\), \\(6\\), and \\(8\\) appear in both the numerator and denominator:\n\\[\n= \\dfrac{1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 12 \\cdot 14}{3 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 1}.\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n= \\dfrac{10 \\cdot 12 \\cdot 14}{3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7}.\n\\]\nNow, we will calculate the numerator \\(10 \\cdot 12 \\cdot 14\\):\n\\[\n10 \\cdot 12 = 120,\n\\]\n\\[\n120 \\cdot 14 = 1680.\n\\]\nNext, we will calculate the denominator \\(3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7\\):\n\\[\n3 \\cdot 5 = 15,\n\\]\n\\[\n15 \\cdot 7 = 105.\n\\]\nTherefore, we now have:\n\\[\n= \\dfrac{1680}{105}.\n\\]\nTo simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). First, we will perform the division:\n\\[\n1680 \\div 105 = 16.\n\\]\nTo find the GCD, we can compute the prime factorizations of \\(1680\\) and \\(105\\) as follows:\n- For \\(1680\\):\n\\[\n1680 = 16 \\times 105 = 16 \\times (3 \\times 5 \\times 7) = 2^4 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 7.\n\\]\n- For \\(105\\):\n\\[\n105 = 3 \\times 5 \\times 7.\n\\]\nNow we observe the common factors. The GCD is \\(3 \\times 5 \\times 7 = 105\\).\nThus, we can simplify:\n\\[\n\\frac{1680 \\div 105}{105 \\div 105} = \\frac{16}{1} = 16.\n\\]\nTherefore, the final product is \n\\[\n\\boxed{16}.\n\\]",
