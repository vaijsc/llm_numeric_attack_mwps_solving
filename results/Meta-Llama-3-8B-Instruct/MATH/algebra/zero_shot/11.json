Since the inequality is strict ($>$, not $\\ge$), $x$ cannot be 6 or $-6$.\n\nNext, we consider $|x+1| \\le 7$.  Writing this as $|x-(-1)| \\le 7$, we see that $x$ must be within $7$ of $-1$ on the number line, which means it must be one of the integers from $-8$ to 6.  Since the inequality is nonstrict ($\\le$, not $<$), $x$ can be $-8$ or 6.\n\nThe only integers that satisfy both inequalities are $-8$ and $-7$, and their sum is $\\boxed{-15}$.",

So we have only one solution for |x|=6, which is -6.\nWhen |x+1|=7, |x+1| could be positive or negative, so x+1 could be -7 or 7. The case x = -8 is rejected because |x|+1 <= 7 doesn't work for x = -8. Similarly, x = 6 is rejected. But when x = 7, |x+1|=7 works. So we have one solution for |x+1|=7, which is x = 7.\nWhen both |x|=6 and |x+1|=7, we have |x|+1 = |x+1| = 7. This implies that x = -1.\nIn conclusion, the solutions are -6, 7 and -1.

Therefore, let\u2019s consider two cases:\n### Case 1: x \u2265 0\n### |x| + 1 > 7 => |x| > 6\nTherefore,\n|x| > 6 => x > 6 (since |x| is the distance of x to the origin on the number line, and all distances greater than 6 will be greater than 6 when taken positive)\nSo we just need to find out how many integers x can be, which are greater than 6, such that their absolute value is greater than 6.\nx can be 7, 8, 9, 10 .... Therefore, we have infinitely many options here.\n### |x + 1| \u2264 7 =>\n|x + 1| \u2264 7 => |-x - 1| \u2264 7 (use the property that -|x| = |x|)\n=> -7 \u2264 -x - 1 \u2264 7 (note that |-x| = |x|, and the distance of an object from the origin is always non-negative)\n=> -8 \u2264 -x \u2264 6 (add 1 to all parts)\n=> 0 \u2264 x \u2264 6 (add x to all parts)\n=> x can be at most 6. But we know that if |x| > 6, then |x + 1| > 7, and that doesn\u2019t satisfy the condition |x + 1| \u2264 7. Therefore, x can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

So the set x \u2265 0 needs to work out for infinitely many cases where |x| > 7.

Therefore, either x+1 less than 0 or x+1 is positive.\nWhen x is positive, x+1 will also positive. So it is said that |x+1|<7. Therefore, we get x+1<7, that gives x<6.\nFor negative values of x, x+1 will also negative. Therefore, either |x+1|<0 or |x+1|<7. Since x+1 can\u2019t be negative, |x+1|<0 will not be valid.
