However, by using function notation and breaking down the process step-by-step, you can make sense of these more complex expressions.\nIn this case, considering $f(x) = x^2 - 1$ and $g(x) = x + 7,$ you might be tempted to start adding and subtracting values directly. However, function notation allows you to encapsulate these functions and then compose them to evaluate the expression.\nBy doing so, you can evaluate the expression more systematically and accurately, making it easier to determine the correct answer. As you work more with functions and expressions, you'll find that using function notation becomes a valuable tool in your problem-solving toolkit.",
