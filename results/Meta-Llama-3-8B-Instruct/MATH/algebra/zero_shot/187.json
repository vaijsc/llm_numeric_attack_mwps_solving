We will call the smaller weight $s$, and the larger weight $l$. We know that $s = s$, $l - s = 20$, and $l + l + s = 185$. We can simplify the third equation by combining like terms: We can decide to solve for $s$ because it is easier to solve. Adding the two equations, we get $$l = 60, s = 30$$ Since the two smaller dogs weigh the same, $s = 30$. Therefore, the largest dog weighs $60$ pounds.",

        " 80 pounds\nLet W_1, W_2 and W_3 be the weights of the three basset hounds. If you subtract the two smaller weights, you will find that they are equal. The problem tells us that W_1 - W_2 = 20; W_2 = W_3. To find out the three weights, I will use the formulas: W_1 + W_2 + W_3 = 185, W_2 = W_3, and W_1 - W_2 = 20. Combining the first two and simplifying, I have W_1 + ... The problem is pretty simple. W_1 + 2W_2 = 185. Combining all three equations, we can solve for W_1. In the given equation, you substitute W_2 for W_3. W_1 + 2W_2 = 185. Plug in the finding of W_2 (which we know from the other equation). Once you have W_1, you can find W_2. Are you sure you wrote equations correctly? We will know right once we know W_2. I wonder what I can plug in to find out W_1. Of course, I can plug in to solve the equation with the other two variables in the same form.\n### Context:\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 80. I hope it is correct. The two smaller dogs are 50 pounds each, so in total 100 pounds. The largest dog is 85. So, the largest dog weighs 85 pounds. I figure this out by solving the equation given.\nW_1 + 2W_2 = 185, W_1 - W_2 = 20. Substitute W_2 for W_2 from the second equation in the first one. W_1 + 2(W_1 - 20) = 185. To find out the value of W_1, solve for it. Simplify the equation by subtracting W_1 from both sides. Then, multiply by 2 from both sides. You can you take half of each side. You add W_1 to both sides. Simplify it all. W_2 = W_2. The result is 80. I hope it is correct. The two smaller dogs weigh the same, so one of them weighs \\boxed{80}.

        " Step 1: Each of the smaller dogs weighs the same. So, if we choose one of those to represent them both we can say their weight is $x$ pounds. Now, we know the weight of both of these dogs together is $2x$. The combined weight of these two that have the same weight and the bigger dog is $185$. $2x + x = 185$. We can simplify this to $3x = 185$. Step 2: Take $3$ on the left side of the equation. Then, on the right side, we have $185$, which is the same as $185/3$. This whole thing is now $x = 185/3$. This is the weight of both the smaller dogs. We need, however, the weight of the biggest one. We know the smaller dogs have weights $20$ less than the big dog. So, we get the big dog\u2019s weight as $20$ more than the smaller ones. $20 + x$. Step3: Now, we have $x = 185/3$. We will multiply both sides by $3$. We have $x * 3 = 620$. Finally, we have $20 + 620 = 640$. The largest dog weighs $\\boxed{640}$.

A different approach is likely, but I find this helps make the calculation somewhat more straightforward.  If needed, I can solve the equations using algebra, but this is for context.\nIf you would like to solve by hand I just worked through the steps that I showed above. But in case you want to do so, I used:\n$\\boxed{185 - 2x}$ instead of $185-2x$ after the steps 1 and 2.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 640.

        " The combined weight of three basset hounds is $185$ pounds. This means $x + y + z = 185$, where $x$ is the weight of the smallest dog, $y$ is the weight of the smallest dog, and $z$ is the weight of the largest dog. The two smaller dogs weigh the same. This means $x = y$. So, $x + y + z = 185$ implies $x + x + z = 185$, or $2x + z = 185$. The difference between the larger weight and the smaller weight is $20$ pounds. This means $z - x = 20$.

        " \nThe question tells us that the combined weight is $185$ pounds. Let the three basset hounds have weights $x, x,$ and $y$ pounds, where $x$ is the smaller weight, and $y$ is the larger weight.\nThe first thing to notice from the question is that $x+x+y=185$, or $2x+y=185$. The second thing to notice from the question is that $y-x=20$.\nWe can use the equation $y-x=20$ to express $y$ in terms of $x$:\n$$y=x+20.$$Substitute this into $2x+y=185$ and solve for$x$:\\begin{align*}\n2x+x+20&=185\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 3x+20&=185\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 3x&=165\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x&=165/3=55\n\\end{align*}\nSo, the two smaller dogs weigh $x=55$ pounds each, and the largest dog weighs $y=x+20=75$ pounds. Therefore, the largest dog weighs $\\boxed{75}$ pounds.\n### Principal reasoning: \nThe key here is to analyze and use the information given in the question. First, recognize the order of the given information, then use it to find the unknown, which is the largest dog's weight. Having this quick understanding allows to successfully make the substitutions and solve the linear equation.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 75. I hope it is correct.  ### The answer could be the following in a different form: 75 pounds. If we want to, we could use $y$ as the largest weight, and $x$ as the smaller weight. First, we solve for $x$ in the equation $2x+y=185$: $2x=185-y$, and then $x=(185-y)/2$. We are given that $y-x=20$, which gives $20+y-x=(185-y)/2$, and then $40+y=185-y$, and then $2y=145$, and then $y=145/2=72.5$, and then $x=185-y=(185-72.5)/2=56.25$, and then $y-x=20$, and then $72.5-56.25=20$. We can also solve for $x$ in $2x+y=185$: $",
        " Let\u2019s begin. We know that the total weight is 185. We know that the smallest two hounds weigh the same. So they will be represented by h. We know that the largest one is h+20, so the total is h+h+h+20. So, we substitute: 185 = h+h+h+20. We factor: 185 = 3h+20. Now, we subtract 20 from each side: 165 = 3h. And then, we divide each side by 3: 55 = h. We know that both small ones are h = 55, and the big one is h+20. So, h+20 = 75. The largest dog weighs 75 pounds. Final Answer: The final answer is 75. I hope it is correct.  ### Why is this an algebraic thinking problem? Algebraic thinking is the ability to recognize patterns and manipulate them using symbolic representations. This problem requires using variables and solving equations to find the unknown weight of the largest dog. The problem also involves using algebraic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to solve the equation. Additionally, the problem requires using strategy and thinking critically to break down the information provided and solve the problem efficiently.  ### Why is this an open-ended problem? An open-ended problem is one that has multiple possible solutions and does not have a specific path to the solution. This problem meets the criteria for an open-ended problem because it does not specify how to find the answer, only that we should use algebra to solve it. There are multiple possible approaches to solving the problem, and the solution is not unique. For example, one could use a system of equations, or one could use algebraic operations to solve the equation directly. This open-ended nature of the problem allows students to think creatively and develop their problem-solving skills by exploring different approaches and methods.  ### Why is this an authentic problem? An authentic problem is one that reflects real-world scenarios and requires students to apply their knowledge and skills to solve a meaningful problem. This problem meets the criteria for an authentic problem because it involves solving a real-world scenario that basset hound owners may encounter. The problem requires applying algebraic thinking skills to solve a problem that is relevant to everyday life. The scenario is relatable, and the problem is presented in a way that is easy to understand, making it an authentic problem for students to solve.  Date created: 2021-09-01 14:03:",
