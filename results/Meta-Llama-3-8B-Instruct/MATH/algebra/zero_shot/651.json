        " In order to find the degree of the polynomial $f(x)+cg(x)$, we must understand what constitutes a polynomial of degree 2.

In order to achieve this, we need to look at the $x^3$ terms in the expression for \\[f(x)+cg(x).\\]We have that $f(x)$ has a term of $-6x^3$, whereas $g(x)$ has a term of $-6x^3$ as well.

        " First, let\u2019s try to add $f$ and $g$, without worrying about the degree, just simplify: $$f(x)+cg(x)=(4x^3+3x^2+2x+1)+c(3-4x+5x^2-6x^3).$$We will group the $x^3$ terms together: $$f(x)+cg(x)=(4x^3-6x^3)+(3x^2+5x^2)+(-4+c)x+1+3.$$This gives us: $$f(x)+cg(x)=(-2x^3)+(8x^2)+(-2x+4).$$From here, we can see that to get a polynomial of degree 2, we need to get the degree 3 terms (the $x^3$ term) to cancel out. So we need $-2x^3+(-6x^3)=0$, which implies $c$ must be $\\boxed{3}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 3. I hope it is correct.### ",
        " \nThen let's break it down step by step.\nWe need to find a constant $c$ such that $f(x)+cg(x)$ has degree 2. To do this, we will look at the terms of the polynomials with the highest degree (i.e., $x^3$) and balance them out to have a lower degree.\nThe polynomials are\n$$f(x)=4x^3+3x^2+2x+1\\qquad\\text{and}\\qquad g(x)=3-4x+5x^2-6x^3.$$The $x^3$ term of $f(x)$ is $4x^3$ and the $x^3$ term of $g(x)$ is $-6x^3$. To balance them out, we need to have\n$$4x^3+(-6c)x^3=\\boxed{0}$$The only way to have $0x^3$ is if $c=\\boxed{\\frac{4}{6}=\\frac{2}{3}}$.\nNow that we have balanced out the $x^3$ term, we are left with lower degree terms. The $x^2$ terms are $3x^2$ and $5x^2$, and the $x$ term is $2x$ and $-4x$. So, we have a decent polynomial with degree 2.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is c = \\frac{2}{3}. I hope it is correct. \nThe polynomial $f(x)+cg(x)$ should not have an $x^3$ term because the problem asks for it to have degree 2, so we set the coefficient of $x^3$ in $f(x)+cg(x)$ to 0. But this is exactly done when we force our guess, or the solution, for c in this specific problem. The reason I mentioned it is that, in general for a problem of this type, in the solution, we force the term with the degree of the polynomial to be 0.",
        " Let\u2019s denote $f(x)+cg(x)=p(x)$ for simplicity.\nThe highest degree term of $p(x)$ must be the highest degree term of either $f(x)$ or $g(x)$.  The highest degree term of $g(x)$ is $-6x^3$, and the highest degree term of $f(x)$ is $4x^3$.  In order for the highest degree term of $p(x)$ to have degree 2, we need \\begin{align*}4x^3+c(-6x^3)&=0.\\end{align*}This equation implies that $c=4/6=\\boxed{2/3}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2/3. I hope it is correct.  It should be correct because it is probably unique.  If it is not unique, it still should be a solution and by trying we can find the other one.  Therefore, we consider the remainder after dividing $f+c g$ by $x^2$.  The remainder can only consist of the terms of degree $0$ or $1$ as they are not divisible by $x^2$, but they will have degree less than $2$.

        " The goal is to simplify $f(x)+cg(x)$ as much as possible such that the terms of degree 3 cancel each other, and we are left with a degree 2 polynomial.

Here, we subtract the degree 3 term (in green) of $cg(x)$ from the degree 3 term of $f(x)$. The key step is to write the two degree 3 terms on the same side of the equation before combining, and then we can cancel out the degree 3 terms by equating coefficients. pic-tutorial-simplifying-polynomials Here, we are equating the degree 3 term coefficients. We have $4c$ as the coefficient of $x^3$ in $cg(x)$ and we want $-2x^3$ to cancel it out, so we can set up the equation $4c=-2$. Solving this equation gives $c=\\boxed{2}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2. I hope it is correct. ### If someone wants to see how $4c$ was obtained, look at the following: In $cg(x)$, the degree 3 term is $-6x^3$. Now, to find the coefficient of $x^3$ in $cg(x)$, we multiply the constant term of $g(x)$ ($c$) by $-6$, since $-6$ is the coefficient of $x^3$ in $g(x)$. This gives us $c(-6)=-6c$.

In general, to make the degree of an expression less than some degree, we must remove the terms of a higher degree.  For example, the expression $$a+bx+cx^2$$ has degree 2.  To remove the degree 1 term, we can simply add the expression $-(b+c)x$ on each side.  For the sake of simplicity, if the expression is $$a+bx+cx^2+dx^3,$$ we can write it as $$a+c LX + dx^3,$$  where $LX$ stands for the linear term.

        " Because $f(x)=ax^3+bx^2+cx+d$, we have $\\boxed{a=4,b=3,c=2,d=1}$, so  \\begin{align*}f(x)+cg(x)&=(4-cx^3)+(3x^2)+(2x)+(1)+cg(x)\\\\&=3x^2+(2-cx)+1+c(-6x^3+5x^2-4x+3)\\\\&=3x^2+5x^2-6x^3+2-cx+c(-4x)+1-3\\\\&=8x^2-6x^3-cx-4x+(-2)\\\\&=8x^2-6x^3+(c-4)x-2.\\end{align*}The above is degree 2 if $c=4$. Hence, $\\boxed{c=4}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is c=4. I hope it is correct.ritis study is limited, but we can explore the issue in a related context. Many of the arguments I have formulated using sexual labor to enable social and economic change are similar to the arguments made by other authors for the use of sex work more broadly. While the legislative framework for sex work varies across jurisdictions, the central issue remains: how to balance individual liberties and human rights while addressing concerns about exploitation and public health. This issue is relevant to other forms of labor, including workers in high-risk or low-wage jobs, who may face similar challenges in asserting their rights and improving their working conditions.\nLet's take the case of domestic workers, who are a significant group of workers in many countries. In many cases, domestic workers are employed in private homes, where they may be vulnerable to exploitation and abuse. However, they are also an essential part of the labor force, providing vital care and support to families.\nAs with sex workers, the key challenge is to ensure that domestic workers have access to the protections and services they need to do their jobs safely and with dignity. This includes protections against exploitation and abuse, as well as access to healthcare, social services, and labor rights.\nTo achieve these goals, we need to consider the broader social and economic contexts in which domestic workers operate. This means addressing issues like poverty, gender inequality, and the undervaluing of care work. It also means recognizing the diverse experiences and needs of domestic workers, who may face different challenges depending on their nationality,",
        " In order to determine the degree of the sum polynomial, we must determine the highest degree term of both  $f(x)$ and $g(x)$  and discard all lower degree terms in both.\nThe highest degree term in $f(x)$ is  $4x^3$, and the highest degree term in $g(x)$ is  $-6x^3$. Therefore, the highest degree term in their sum is $4x^3+(-6x^3)=\\boxed{-2x^3}$, which has degree 3.\nHowever, because we want the highest degree term to be even, in this case a degree 2 term, we need to add enough multiples of $g(x)$ such that the degree 3 term is removed.\nThis can be done by making the degree 3 term in $f(x)+cg(x)$ equal to 0.\nWe can write this as  $-2x^3+4x-0x^3=0$,\n$4x=2x^3$. Solving this equation for c yields  $c=\\frac{4}{2}=\\boxed{2}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2. I hope it is correct.  #3\n### More educational resources about linear programming with polynomial of degree two:\nFor a broader look at linear programming with polynomial of degree two, please refer to the following:\n1. Khan Academy: Linear Programming\nThis short tutorial will help you get an understanding of linear programming and polynomial of degree two.\n2. Now, back to our topic on finding the value of c.  We will see how we can measure the degree of the polynomial f(x)+cg(x).\n### Measurement of degree in polynomial of degree two:\nTo find the degree of the polynomial f(x)+cg(x), we can calculate the highest degree term.\nWe know that the highest degree term is the leading term when we write the polynomial in standard form.\nFor the polynomial f(x)+cg(x), we have:\n$f(x)=4x^3+3x^2+2x+1$; and\n$g(x)=3-4x+5x^2-6x^3$\nWhen we add these two polynomials together, we get:\n$f(x)+cg(x)=(4c-6)x^3+(5+3c)x^2+(2-4c)x+1+3c$\nWe can see that the highest degree term is:\n$(4c-6)x",
        " Let\u2019s denote the given polynomials as:  $$f(x)=a_3x^3+a_2x^2+a_1x+a_0=4x^3+3x^2+2x+1$$and  $$g(x)=b_3x^3+b_2x^2+b_1x+b_0=3-4x+5x^2-6x^3.$$We want the leading coefficient of the resulting polynomial to be $0$.  To achieve this goal, we set the sum of the leading coefficients to $0$:\n$$4x^3-6x^3+c(0) = 0 \\Rightarrow c = \\boxed{3}$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 3. I hope it is correct.
