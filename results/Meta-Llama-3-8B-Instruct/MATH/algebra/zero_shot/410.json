        "  We know that $a<b$, so $$|a-b|=b-a.$$Let\u2019s compute $$a+b+E.$$We will simplify this expression to $2b.$ First, let\u2019s combine $a$ and $b$ by adding $b$ to both sides of the first equation:$$a+b=(b-a)+b=a+2b\\Rightarrow (a+b)+E=a+2b+E.$$Now we will simplify the last expression.   $$b-a+a+2b=a+2b+E\\Rightarrow 3b+E=a+2b+E.$$Now we can simply simplify $3b+E$ by adding $2b$ to $3b,$ and $a+2b+E$ by adding $2b$ to $a+2b:-b+4b=a+4b+E\\Rightarrow 3b=a+4b+E\\Rightarrow4b-3b=a+E.$$After simplifying $4b-3b$ by subtracting $3b$ from $4b$, we are left with $b=E$ (after adding $a$ to both sides, since we can come up with $4b-3b+3b=4b$ and $3b+a=a+E$).  Now we can simplify $3b$ by adding $b$ to $4b$:  $$4b=(4-3b)+3b,$$  where $4-3b+3b=4.$ Next, the value of $|a-b|+a+b$ is completely done.  It is equal to $$|a-b|+a+b=(b-a)+a+b=b+2a.$$In order to answer our final question, we must substitute our answer we figured out earlier, since $a$ and $b$ are our random integers, where $a$ must be less than $b$:$$b+2a=a\\cdot a\\cdot43.$$We can simplify this expression, since the answer we figured out is equal to 4a.  Since $a$ is always less than $b$, $4b-3b$ (expressing $|a-b|+a+b$ inside our equation) is more than $a+E$ (expressing $4b-3b+a+E$ inside an equation).

        " The absolute value of $(a-b)$ is equal to the difference between $a$ and $b$. Let\u2019s look at a step by step breakdown.\nIf we let $a=2$ and $b=4$, we have that $|a-b|=|-2|=2$, and $$|a-b|+a+b=2+2+4=\\boxed{8}.$$ I applied the given conditions of the problem statement, namely $a<b$.\nIt works! In general, we can write: \\begin{align*} |a-b|+a+b&=|-(b-a)|+a+b\\\\ &=b-a+a+b\\\\ &=b.\\end{align*} Thus, when $a<b$, the value of $|a-b|+a+b$ is $b$.\nFor example, if we let $a=1$ and $b=3$, then $$|1-3|+1+3=2+1+3=6.$$ For this case, we can substitute $a=1$ and $b=3$, and we would have that the value of $|a-b|+a+b=\\boxed{6}$.",
        " For the problem\n$$|a-b|+a+b$$ we have \n$$|a-b| =-(a-b)=-a+b$$ (The Absolute Value Function is non-negative so we need to negate the expression.)\nHence \n$$|a-b|+a+b=-(a-b)+a+b=2b-a$$\nas $a<b$ is given. Therefore, the value of $|a-b|+a+b$ is $\\boxed{2b-a}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2b-a. I hope it is correct.  if you have any confusion feel free to ask. i am here to help.\nI hope you are doing well. I will be always here. Thank you.  you are always welcome.\n",
        " Because $a<b,$ we have that $$a-b<0$$\n$$a-b=-|a-b|$$\nUsing this substitution, we have that $$|a-b|+a+b=-|a-b|+a+b$$ $$\\Rightarrow |a-b|+a+b=(a+b)+|a-b|$$ $$=b+(a-b)$$ $$=\\boxed{2b}$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2b. I hope it is correct.### ",
        " \nFirst, we want to determine if  $|a-b|+a+b$ will be positive, negative, or zero.\nFrom the question, we know $a<b$, thus $b-a>0$. Therefore, $a-b<0$, so $|a-b|=-(a-b)=b-a$. So we get $$|a-b|+a+b=(b-a)+a+b=2b.$$\nSince $a<b$, $2b>2a$. Thus $|a-b|+a+b=2b$ must be positive, and since $|a-b|+a+b$ is positive, adding  $a$ and $b$ together results in the positive.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2b. I hope it is correct. Thank you for your time.  If a< b, then |a-b|+a+b = 2b. This is the final answer.  We should ensure that final answer is positive. In addition, the final answer should include both a and b.\nIn other cases, you will end up with a wrong answer.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2b. I hope it is correct.  Solution 2:\nFor a< b , it is sufficient to show that the final answer is always positive so the solution given is the best possible solution with  b discounted the result.\nHowever, it is necessary to give the solution as a best possible solution or its solution.\nIf a <b, then we can conclude that the final answer is always positive, since the positive value of a will always\nflushed for the final answer, and this solution will keep the final element.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2b. I hope it is correct. Thank you for your time.  Final Answer: The final answer is 2b. I hope it is correct.  I tried to simplify the problem by considering the absolute value into consideration, but the final answer was wrong.\nThe best way to solve this problem is to ignore the absolute value temporarily and solve the equation based on the positive conditions given in the problem.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2b. I hope it is correct. Thank you for your time.  Final Answer: The final answer is 2b. I hope it is correct.
