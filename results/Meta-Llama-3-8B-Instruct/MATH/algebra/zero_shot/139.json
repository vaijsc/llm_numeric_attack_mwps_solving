For $x\\le -2$, we have $|2-|x||=1$ becomes $x+2=1$, which gives $x=-1$, which is also outside the range.

So let\u2019s represent $x$ as $\\pm y$ for some real $y$ to no loss of generality.\nThe first equation becomes $2 - |x| = 1$, or $2 - |x| = -1$. In terms of $y$, we have $2 - |x| = 1$ becoming $2-|y|=1$, or $2-|y|=-1$. We then use some simple bounds. We see that if $y \\geq 0$, then $2 - |y| = 2-y$ and that if $y \\leq 0$, then $2 - |y| = 2+y$. By inspection, the equation has no solution for the $-1$ case, but the equation $2 - |y| = 1$ has the solution $y = 1$ and $y = -1$.\nBy putting back in the variables, these solutions become $x = 1$ and $x = -1$.\nThe second equation becomes $|x|-2=1$, which becomes $y-2=y$ in terms of $y$, and we can easily solve for $y$. We find that $y = 3$ and $y = -3$.\nBy putting back in the variables, these solutions become $x = 3$ and $x = -3$.\nTherefore, the sum of the squares of these $x$ values is $(1)^2 + (-1)^2 + (3)^2 + (-3)^2 = 1 + 1 + 9 + 9 = \\boxed{20}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 20.
