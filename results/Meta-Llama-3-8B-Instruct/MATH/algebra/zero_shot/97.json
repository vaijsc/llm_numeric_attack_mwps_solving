        " \nWe know that an arithmetic sequence ends after $n$ terms, where $n$ is a positive integer such that the $n$-th term, $a_n$, satisfies the condition:\n$$a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d,$$where $a_1$ is the first term, and $d$ is the common difference. Now, we are given a sequence of the form $13+nd$, where $d=7$ and we want to know what is $n$ when $a_n=2008$? \nLet\u2019s solve this:\n$$2008 = 13 + (n-1)(7)$$ $$2008 = 13 + 7n - 7$$ $$1995 = 7n$$ $$n = 285$$ Hence, there are $\\boxed{285}$ integers in the arithmetic sequence. It can be verified using Excel Spread sheet. This is because, by multiplying $\\frac{2008-13}{7} = 285$ on both sides, 2008 was obtained. We have 285. It's true.\nEnjoy your lunch. Thank you for the attention of this matter. It has been long hours of thinking.\n### Proof of the Axiom: Many mathematical sequences can be implication for the formation, thus, 1.### There is an arithmetic number sequence generated from the sequence (13, 20,, 27, 34,, 2008). Then, it follows that there is an arithmetic number of sequences made of all different numbers. Lastly, we naturally follow up with the final conclusion that there are 285 in the sequence of arithmetic. We then go through the above idea in the instructions on the geometric sequence.

Similarly, if you continue to add $7$ to $34$, you would get the next term $41$, and if you continue to add $7$ to $41$, you would get the next term $48$, and so on.\n### Another ",

Plugging the first term into the equation and solving for $n_0$ gives \\begin{align*} a_1 = n_0 + (1-1)d &= 13\\\\ \\therefore\\quad n_0 &= 13 \\end{align*} So we know $n_0 = 13$ and $d = 7$.

        " 50\nHere is my response.\nLet $a_n$ be the $n$th term of the sequence. Then $a_1 = 13$ and $a_n = 13 + 7(n-1)$.\nWe need to find the smallest $n$ such that $a_n = 2008$. $$13 + 7(n-1) = 2008$$ $$\\implies n-1 = 285$$ $$\\implies n = 286$$ Thus $n=286$ is the smallest $n$ such that $a_n = 2008.$ Therefore, the sequence has $\\boxed{50}$ terms, from $a_1 = 13$ to $a_{50} = 2008.$\nThis problem comes from [Solution to 2008 AMC 10B Problem #25](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/2008_AMC_10B_Problems/Problem_25)\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 50.
