        " \nThe most straightforward possible method to do this is by looking at the diagonal on each of the two squares.  When you do this, you find that the diagonals have slope $\\pm1$.  The line that goes through $(0,0)$ and $(2,2)$ is $y=x$, which has slope $1$.  The line that goes through $(4,2)$ and $(5,3)$ is $\\frac{1}{1}=1$, which also has slope $1$.  However, the line that goes through the points in a line, does not define a line, which does not meet the diagonal of the second square, nor passes through the bottom line of the first square does not lie inside this square either. The only lines that are possible are the lines such as $y=1$, because, going up and down and going to the same point. But it does not meet the line $x=0$. The straight line, the line from the above the square that is the greatest and meets the point (5,3) is $y=2$. We are looking at $y=\\pm1$ to AB, it has slope, which tells us that this line is $x+y=5$, because it goes through the lines of squares with square sides from square points, with slope, as the greatest possible slope, from $x=0$ and $y=0$, to the point $(2,2)$, there are lines such as $y=1$ or $y=-1$. Graphics could be drawn. We can observe that the equation of the lines $y=\\pm1$ to $AB$ tells us that the equation $x+y=5$. To find the slope, we found $y=2$ so it is the greatest. Hence the answer is $\\frac{2}{1}=2$ which is the greatest of the slope, and it is a line, the line that goes up from the bottom line at $x=0$ through the greatest slope possible, and it meets the line of $y=3$ and $x=5$. However, we don\u2019t know which side B lies.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2. I hope it is correct. Let me know if there are any alternatives. Another way is that if the line from A bottom line ends (2,2), then there is only a small piece of lines which is B, is AB. The greatest slope is up while $x+y=5$",
        " Note that the entire square containing $A$ has slope 0, and likewise the entire square containing $B$. So the entire line passing through points $A$ and $B$ is either horizontal or it is contained entirely in the $1^{\\rm{st}}$ or $4^{\\rm{th}}$ quadrants. This means that the answer is a slope that maximizes the value from all of these parts. That slope is $\\boxed{1}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 1. I hope it is correct.

        " (A)$\nFor point $A$, let $a = x$ and $b = y$, and for point $B$, let $x + 2 = c$ and $y + 1 = d$.\nSo for point $A$, we get $xy = 0$, for point $B$, $cd = 2$.\nNow let\u2019s solve for the slope of the line that contains $A$ and $B$.\nSo the slope is $\\frac{d-b}{c-a}$, but note that this is the same as $\\frac{d-a+1}{c-a+2}$ so we can rewrite the slope equation as $\\frac{d+1-a}{c+2-a}$.\nSo using the values for points $A$ and $B$:\n$\\frac{d+1-a}{c+2-a} = \\frac{d+1-y}{c+2-x}$\nNow let\u2019s simplify this. For $y$ we get a range where $y$ varies from $0$ to $2$, and for $x$ we get a range where $x$ varies from $0$ to $2$.\nSo the greatest value of $d$ for point $B$ is $3$, and the greatest value of $c$ for point $B$ is $5$.\nGiven that range, the greatest value for the slope can occur at $d = 3$, $c = 5$.\nSo we can rewrite the slop equation to get: $\\frac{3+1-y}{5+2-x}$.\nNow, taking this equation from $y=0$ to $y=2$ and $x=0$ to $x=2$, we can get that the greatest value for the slope is when $y=2$ and $x=2$.\nSo then we can say that: $\\frac{4}{3} = \\boxed{\\frac{4}{3}}$ is the greatest possible value of the slope of the line that contains points $A$ and $B$, so, the answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{4}{3}}$.Final Answer: The final answer is \\frac{4}{3}.

        " \nNotice that the line $AB$ intersects the lower left diagonal of the squares (which are defined as the weaker diagonals of the squares), hence we'll define the line as $AB$.  We know that $A(x_1,y_1)$ lie on the line that conects $(0,0)$ and $(2,2)$, since it's inside or on the square, so $\\frac{y_1}{x_1}=\\frac{2}{2}=1$. Therefore, the equation of the line containing $A$ is $$y=x+y_1-x_1$$ which simplifies to $$y=x-y_1+x_1$$ So we have $2-y_1+x_1=2$ which gives $y_1=x_1-2$.   Substituting into the equation of the line gives  $$y=x+(x_1-2)-x_1$$ which gives $y=x-2$. Now let's consider $B(x_2,y_2)$ lie on the line that conects $(4,2)$ and $(5,3)$, then $\\frac{y_2}{x_2}=\\frac{3-2}{5-4}=1$.

Let the $y$-coordinate of point B, which also lies on the same y-axis, be y_1=2.\nLet the $x$-coordinate of point A be denoted $a$ such that $0\\le a \\le2$. Since $y_0=0$, the coordinates of point A are $(a,0)$. Let the $x$-coordinate of point B be denoted $b$ such that $4\\le b \\le5$.

The maximum value of $b$ is $5$ because of $(4,2)$ and $(5,3)$, and $a$ is also at maximum when the point lies at top-right in a square, at 2 so it gives the maximum point $(b,a)$.

Thus, it has maximal value of $y_1$ (I think here 'y_1' means maximum value of y_1 , because $y_1\\le2$, $0\\le x_1\\le 2$) and thus, $y_1=2$. Now, the point $B$ has coordinate, it is on the line $x=4$, so has maximal value for $y_2$ which is $y_2=3$. Now, we have that $m=\\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}=\\frac{3-2}{4-0}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$.\n### ",
        " The height difference is at most $5-2=3$, and the width difference is at least $2$. So the slope is at most $\\frac{3}{2}$. Finally, we can show that this is the maximum. We can draw a line that joins $\\left(0,\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$ and $\\left(2,2\\right)$. Since the distance along the line between these two points is 2, and the distance between them is $\\frac{1}{2}$ from the $x$-axis and $1\\frac{1}{2}$ from the $y$-axis, we can easily show that the slope is $\\frac{3}{2}$ by a simple ratio computation. Then to create a line with a greater slope, we must move the point above the point $\\left(2,2\\right)$ and below the line; in so doing, the line appears to be less steep, which isn\u2019t what we want because we want the greatest slope. Hence, we also move it to the right; but here we won\u2019t be able to find a situation for even greater slopes. Finally, we just need to find a point $A$ with such properties in which its distance to the point $\\left(2,2\\right)$ is the greatest. By simple observation we choose the point $\\left(0,2\\right)$ that satisfies the condition. But here we note that the line composed of the points $\\left(2,2\\right)$, $\\left(4,3\\right)$ and the other is supplementary. So we are fifing the point by which the slope reaches the greatest. For that we will continue the process. The precise number of information given by Figure 1.00 we obtain easily by making a limb. Figure 2.00: then from $B$ \u201clocate $A$\u201d He will be able to determine the calculations which already sort to the way given by the calculation of y on the right. And some necessary calculations on y.\nMathematical explanations: As the points are descriptive.\nNow that these are 5 tasks, we check that we are final and that our question is complete. Because our information is simple. So, we will re-use the image by position point $A$. As we see that $A$ began when the new image was created. First case, the current $A$ phenomenon view.

        " Problem Score: 3.5 (I could have done more work)\nSuppose the line contains both points $A$ and $B$. For point $A$, let the coordinates be $(x,y)$.  For point $B$, let the coordinates be $(x',y')$.\nThe greatest possible value of the slope is when $y$ is maximized and $y'$ is minimum or vice versa. When $y$ is maximized and $y'$ is minimum, $y$ will be $2$. In this case, $(x,y)=(0,2)$.  The line containing points $A$ and $B$ is then a line with slope\n$$\\frac{2-b}{0-b}=\\infty.$$The answer is $\\boxed{\\infty}.$!\nGiven that $\\lvert y-y'\\rvert$ must be less than or equal to $1$, the only line that would satisfy this is a vertical line containing both point $A$ and $B$.  In this case, we get the answer $\\boxed{0}.$\n#### Solution 2:\nLet\u2019s draw a picture of the situation:\n![](https://mathbitsnotebook.com/Geometry/CoordinateHN/koord4.jpg)\nBecause $y\u2019$ must be between $2$ and $3$, points lying on the same line in region $1$ and region $2$ will be the most extreme.  From region $1$, the $y$-values will be the maximum.  In region $2$, the $x$-values will be the maximum.\nThe lines in region $2$ will be:\n![](https://mathbitsnotebook.com/Geometry/CoordinateHN/koord1.jpg)\nThe lines in region $1$ will be:\n![](https://mathbitsnotebook.com/Geometry/CoordinateHN/koord2.jpg)\nNotice that the lines in region $2$ will have slopes less than or equal to $\\frac{1}{2}$, while the lines in region $1$ will have slopes greater than or equal to $2$.  Therefore, the lines with the greatest possible slopes are the ones with only $y$-coordinates at the top of region $1$ and the $x$-coordinates at the top of region $2$.\nBecause the distances between all points are less than or equal to $1$, we may use similar triangles.\n![](https://mathbitsnotebook.com/Geometry/CoordinateHN/ko"
