        "To solve this problem, let's begin by setting up the equations based on the given rectangular formations and the conditions stated.\n1. **First Rectangle Dimensions**: The band is in a rectangular formation with dimensions \\( n-2 \\) and \\( n + 8 \\). The total number of members can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   (n-2)(n+8)\n   \\]\n2. **Second Rectangle Dimensions**: In the second stage, they re-arrange into a rectangle of dimensions \\( n \\) and \\( 2n - 3 \\). The total number of members in this arrangement, excluding drummers, can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   n(2n-3)\n   \\]\n3. **Relationship Between the Two Arrangements**: Since the total number of members must remain the same, we can set these two expressions equal to each other. Adding a variable \\( d \\) to represent the number of drummers:\n   \\[\n   (n-2)(n+8) = n(2n-3) + d\n   \\]\n   Since we are told there are at least 4 drummers:\n   \\[\n   d \\geq 4\n   \\]\n4. **Expanding Both Sides**:\n   - Expanding the left side:\n     \\[\n     (n-2)(n+8) = n^2 + 8n - 2n - 16 = n^2 + 6n - 16\n     \\]\n   - Expanding the right side:\n     \\[\n     n(2n - 3) = 2n^2 - 3n\n     \\]\n5. **Setting Up the Equation**:\n   Substituting the expansions back into the equation yields:\n   \\[\n   n^2 + 6n - 16 = 2n^2 - 3n + d\n   \\]\n   Rearranging gives:\n   \\[\n   n^2 - 9n + 16 + d = 0\n   \\]\n   This can be rearranged as:\n   \\[\n   d = -n^2 + 9n - 16\n   \\]\n6. **Finding Values of n**: To find valid values of \\( n \\), we need \\( d \\geq 4 \\):\n   \\[\n   -n^2 + 9n - 16 \\geq 4\n   \\]\n   Simplifying gives:\n   \\[\n   -n^2 + 9n - 20 \\geq 0\n   \\]\n   or\n   \\[\n   n^2 - 9n + 20 \\leq 0\n   \\]\n7. **Factoring the Quadratic**:\n   The quadratic \\( n^2 - 9n + 20 \\) can be factored as:\n   \\[\n   (n-4)(n-5) \\leq 0\n   \\]\n   The roots of this equation are \\( n = 4 \\) and \\( n = 5 \\).\n8. **Finding the Interval**: To determine where the inequality holds, we analyze the intervals:\n   - Test \\( n < 4 \\): (e.g., \\( n=3 \\)) results in positive.\n   - Test \\( 4 \\leq n \\leq 5 \\): Choose \\( 4.5 \\) which results in negative.\n   - Test \\( n > 5 \\): (e.g., \\( n=6 \\)) results in positive.\n   Hence, the solution to \\( (n-4)(n-5) \\leq 0 \\) indicates that \\( n \\) must lie in the interval:\n   \\[\n   4 \\leq n \\leq 5\n   \\]\n9. **Checking Values of n**:\n   - For \\( n = 4 \\):\n     \\[\n     d = -4^2 + 9(4) - 16 = -16 + 36 - 16 = 4 \\quad (\\text{Valid})\n     \\]\n   - For \\( n = 5 \\):\n     \\[\n     d = -5^2 + 9(5) - 16 = -25 + 45 - 16 = 4 \\quad (\\text{Valid})\n     \\]\n10. **Calculating the Final Sum**:\n   The valid values of \\( n \\) are \\( 4 \\) and \\( 5 \\).

        "To solve for the possible values of \\( n \\) in the given marching band formation problem, we first need to understand the situation with the total number of members who are not drummers.\n### Step 1: Calculate the total number of band members\nIn the first formation, the dimensions are \\( n - 2 \\) (rows) and \\( n + 8 \\) (columns). Therefore, the total number of band members is:\n\\[\n(n - 2)(n + 8)\n\\]\nExpanding this:\n\\[\n(n - 2)(n + 8) = n^2 + 8n - 2n - 16 = n^2 + 6n - 16\n\\]\n### Step 2: Calculate the total number of members excluding drummers\nIn the second formation, the dimensions are \\( n \\) (rows) and \\( 2n - 3 \\) (columns). Hence, the total number of members excluding the drummers is:\n\\[\nn(2n - 3) = 2n^2 - 3n\n\\]\n### Step 3: Establish the relationship between total members and non-drummers\nThe total number of members is equal to the number of non-drummers plus the number of drummers.

The quadratic expression is less than or equal to 0 between these roots, hence:\n\\[\n4 \\leq n \\leq 5\n\\]\n### Step 8: List possible integer values of \\( n \\)\nThe possible integer values of \\( n \\) are \\( 4 \\) and \\( 5 \\). \n### Step 9: Calculate the sum of all possible values of \\( n \\)\nCalculating the sum:\n\\[\n4 + 5 = 9\n\\]\n### Conclusion\nThus, the sum of all possible values of \\( n \\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{9}\n\\]",
        "To solve the problem, let's first denote the total number of members in the band as \\( N \\).

So, there are m*p = n*(2n-3) members after excluding drummers. This will mean that there is a * b = m*p members before excluding drummers were dividable by both m and p. Thus, m*p|a*b. But we have m*p = n*(2n-3) and m = 2n-3. So, since there are at least 4 drummers, or we got n>=4, we have 2n-3|a*b. Or, we should deduce the relationship of a and b and n.

        " The first step in solving the problem is to represent the dimensions of the first rectangle in terms of the number of drummers. To do this, we subtract the length of the rectangle from $n + 8$ to obtain $n$ as the width of the first rectangle. Then, we subtract $2$ from $n$ to get $n-2$ as the length.\nUsing similar thinking, we subtract $n$ from $2n-3$ to obtain $n-3$ as the length of the second rectangle. Finally, we subtract $3$ from $n$ to get $n-3$ as the width of the second rectangle.\n### Example: To illustrate how this works, let\u2019s suppose $n = 5$. For the first rectangle with dimensions $n-2$ and $n+8$, we would have the dimensions $3$ and $13$, since $n-2=5-2=3$ and $n+8=5+8=13$.

However, we can solve it manually like this: \nWe can start doing it from smallest possible values, which is $n = 4$, and we can get the following equation by using the formula Area (Length x Width) and this is checking the condition are at least four drummers. \n$$(n-2)(n+8)=n(2n-3)$$\nI hope you know how to solve these kind of equations . To solve these kind of equations we need to distribute the value of $n$ . It won\u2019t be that hard. Here is the step:$$(n-2)(n+8)=n(2n-3)$$\n$$\\implies 2n^2+n-16=n(2n-3)$$\n$$\\implies 2n^2+n-16=n(2n-3)$$\n$$\\implies 2n^2+n-16=n(2n-3)$$\n$$\\implies 2n^2+n-16=n(2n-3)$$\n$$\\implies 2n^2+n-16=n^2-3n$$\n$$\\implies 2n^2+n-16=n^2-3n$$\n$$\\implies 2n^2+n-16=n^2-3n$$\n$$\\implies n^2+n-16=n^2-3n$$\n$$\\implies n-16=n^2-3n$$\n$$\\implies n^2-4n-16=0$$\n$$(n-8)(n+2)=0$$\nWhich imply $n=8,n=-2$ (which is not satisfying the condition because you can\u2019t have -ve value for n . Therefore, our possible value is $n=8$.\nNow we need to find $$(n-2)(n+8)$$\n$$=(8-2)(8+8)$$\n$$=6\\times 16$$\n$$=96$$\nAnd similarly other\nSo we need to total, we have 96. Which is an answer.\n### Final Answer: The final answer is 96. I hope it is correct. Let me know if you have any other question",

        " \nLet a be the number of drummers. Then $2*(n-2) + 2*(n+8) = m*n$ for some integer $m$. We have $(n-2)*(n+8) = 5*n - 4*m*n = 5*n*(1-m) = m-1$.\n$$(n-2)*((n+8)/n) = m+5$$\n$$(n^2 - 2*n +8)/n = m + 5$$\nThe equation seems to have no solution, but remember that there is at least 4 drummers, so $a \u2265$ 4. Let $n-2 =$ b. Then $b*$ unknown $ = 5*b + 1$.\n$b*(b+6) = 5*b + 1$, so $b^2 + 5*b - 5 = 0$. $b = 1$ or $b = -5$, so $n = 3$ or $n = 3$. That\u2019s the only solution. $n$ is either $3$ or $-5$, but since a must be at least $4$, $n$ must be $3$ and $a = 4$. So $n = 3$.\nThe possible values of $n$ are all summarized in the equation. $n$ = $3$ or $n = -5$ will give $m = 3$\nThe sum of values of $n$ is given by the range defined by the equation (3, -5). $n=3$ add $n$ to both sides\nThis will clean up the equation carefully and make sure there are no complex numbers, you should do something similar under the location and index of the abstract. $3 + 3$ - $5 = 3$\n### Answer: \nThe sum of all possible values of $n$ is $\\boxed{0}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 0.
