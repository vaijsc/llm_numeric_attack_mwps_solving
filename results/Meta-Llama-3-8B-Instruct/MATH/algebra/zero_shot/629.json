The first main action (prefix \"A\") represents the amount of emeralds we have initially.

        " 3\nThis is a weird notation, but it\u2019s pretty common to denote simple operations like addition. So if $A\\ \\spadesuit\\ B = A + B + 4$, and we want to find the value of $A$ for which $A\\ \\spadesuit\\ 2 = 19$. We set the two expressions equal and solve for $A$: $A + 2 + 4 = 19\\ \\Rightarrow\\ A + 6 = 19\\ \\Rightarrow\\ A = 13$. Wait, no. That can\u2019t be right. We started with $A$ and then added $2$ and $4$, but now we need to find the value of $A$ when $A\\ \\spadesuit\\ 2 = 19$. Hmm. I stared at the equation for a little while, and then it hit me: move the $2$ and the $4$ to the other side. Then we have $A = 19 - 2 - 4 = 19 - 6 = 13$.\nNo, no. I just noticed that the question asks for $A$ when $A\\ \\spadesuit\\ 2 = 19$, which is $A + 2 + 4 = 19$. This should remind us that we need to subtract $2$ and $4$ from $19$, not add them. So, $19 - 2 - 4 = 13$. Finally! The value of $A$ is $3$, not $13$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 3. I hope it is correct. 36 I think. No, it's $3$. Anyway, that's my answer. If you think I'm wrong, use your mighty powers to convince me or tell me the truth (I hope it's not $3$). Correct me if I'm wrong.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 3.

Since $A \\ \\spadesuit\\ 2 = 19$, we know $A \\ \\spadesuit\\ 2 = (A + 2) + 4$, or in other words, $19 = (A + 2) + 4$, so, after subtracting $2$ from both sides:\n$$17 = (A + 2) + 4 - 2 = A + 4 = A = 17 - 4 = \\boxed{13}.$$The correct answer is $13$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 13.
