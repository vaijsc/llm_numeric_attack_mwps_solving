We know that \\begin{align*}\ng(f(x))&=x,\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad f(g(x))&=x.\n\\end{align*} Therefore, $$f(g(x))-g(x)=f(g(x))-f(f(g(x)))=f(x)-f(g(x))=f(x)-x,$$ which is equal to $\\boxed{f(x)-x}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is f(x)-x. I hope it is correct.  ### Solution 2:  We know that $f$ is an inverse of itself, since we know that $f(f(x)) = x$ for all $x$.   We can use this to determine what $f^{-1}(x)$ is.   It should be the solution to $y = f(x)$ when $f(x) = x$.   Therefore, $f^{-1}(x) = x$, and so $f(x) - f^{-1}(x) = \\boxed{f(x) - x}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is f(x) - x.

        " If $f(f(x)) = x$, then we can let $$x' = f(x)$$Let's do that and rewrite $$f(x')=x$$ or equivalently: $$\\boxed{x=f^{-1}(x')}$$ \nNow, we can try a simple trick to solve the question.\n\\\\\n\\\\\nLet's find a $y$ so that $x = f^{-1}(f(y))$.

We see that it's telling us that $y = f(x)$.\n\\\\\n\\\\\nIn the same way, if we find a $z$ so that $x' = f^{-1}(f^{-1}(z))$, can we think of why this means that $z = x$?

I have a little understanding of this one. My mistake was that I didn't noticed $f(f^{-1}(x)) = x$.\nI realized that $f$ is an invertible function, then it is a bijection. Thus, $f$ has an inverse function. Hence, $f(f^{-1}(x)) = x$, because the composition of a function and its inverse is always the identity function.\nThank you for explaining and helping me, even though I messed up originally.",
        " We can start by first finding the inverse of the original function $f(x)$. To do this, let $g(x) = f^{-1}(x)$. We know that $$g(f(x)) = f^{-1}(f(x)) = x.$$ So we have that $$g(x) = g(f(f(x)))$$ because $f(f(x)) = x$. Therefore, $$g(x) = f^{-1}(x).$$ So now we can simplify $f(x)-f^{-1}(x)$ as follows:\n\\begin{align*}\nf(x)-f^{-1}(x) &= f(x) - g(x) \\\\\n&= f(x) - f^{-1}(f(f(x))) \\\\\n&= f(x) - f(x) \\\\\n&= \\boxed{0.}\n\\end{align*} Thus, the result is 0.",
        " \nLet $g(x)=f^{-1}(x).$  Then since $f(g(x))=x,$ we also know that $f(f(g(x)))=x$.  From the latter equation, we can compute $g$, which turns out to be $(f(x))$.  That is, $f^{-1}(x)=f(x).$  Therefore, $f(x)-f^{-1}(x)=f(x)-f(x)=\\boxed{0}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 0. I hope it is correct. Please mark me as correct and provide feedback.

        " For any $x\\in(-\\infty,\\infty)$, we must have that $f(x)\\in(-\\infty,\\infty)$, and thus there is some $x_1\\in(-\\infty,\\infty)$ such that $f(x_1)=x$.  Then $f(f(x_1))=f(x)$.

        " Since $f(f(x))=x$, we have that $f(f(x))$ is equal to $f(f^{-1}(f(x)))$ and $x=f(f^{-1}(f(x)))$.  The last equation tells is that $f$ maps $f^{-1}(f(x))$ back to $x$, which means that $f^{-1}(f(x))=x$.  Then we have that $f^{-1}(f(x))=x=x^{-1}$.  This can be rewritten as $f^{-1}(x)=x^{-1}$.  This implies that $f^{-1}(x)=\\frac{1}{x}$, since $f^{-1}(x)$ maps $x$ to $1/x$.
