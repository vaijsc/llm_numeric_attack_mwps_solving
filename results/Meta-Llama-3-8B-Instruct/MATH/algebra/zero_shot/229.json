        " `2013`\nNote:There are 9 perfect squares less than or equal to 81, i.e., $4,9,16,25,36,49,64, and $81$. It follows that there are 9 possibilities for $x^2$, i.e., $x^2=4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81$. In every case, we take out a $1x$ from $a^2+2ab+b^2$, so that it becomes $(x+1)^2= x^2+2x+1$. This can be applied to all possible cases. Hence, the sum of all possible values of $x$ is $4+9+16+25+36+49+64+81=\\boxed{2013}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2013. I hope it is correct.  George  Proudly Presents his solution: Simply, this problem is really easy once you know how to solve it. Since there are only a few perfect squares that can give a maximum value of 81, the answer is that we just have to find all possible values of $x$ less than 81 and then we have to sum them up. \\begin{align*}x^2&=4=+1\\\\ x^2&=9=+3\\\\ x^2&=16=+4\\\\ x^2&=25=+5\\\\ x^2&=36=+6\\\\ x^2&=49=+7\\\\ x^2&=64=+8\\\\ x^2&=81=+9\\end{align*} By adding up all values, we see that they sum to 2013.  Grover  Proudly Presents his solution: The sum of all possible values of $x$. To get the sum, I must find all possible values of $x$. First, let\u2019s solve for $a^2+2ab+b^2=81$. Now let\u2019s simplify the equation. $a^2+2ab+b^2=(a+b)^2$, let $a+b=x$. $x^2=81$. Now let\u2019s find the value of $x$. $x=9$. Therefore, $a=4$ and $b=5$.

        " First, we can write 2 \\clubsuit x = 4x^2 + 4x + 1 = 81. Subtracting 81 from both sides, we find that 4x^2 + 4x - 80=0. Also, this equation factors to (2x + 10)(2x - 8) = 0.  We can set both factors equal to zero and try to find the solutions:\n\\begin{align*}\n2x + 10 &= 0 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow 2x &= -10 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow x &= \\frac{-10}{2} = -5,\n\\end{align*}\n\\begin{align*}\n2x - 8 &= 0 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow 2x &= 8 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow x &= 8/2 = 4.\n\\end{align*}\n### Thus, the possible values of $x$ are $x = -5$ and $x = 4.$ We need to add these up, which is $\\boxed{-1}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -1.

        " Note: This might require some prior knowledge of quadratic equations or the definition of a parabola, which aren't essential for this solution, but it will definitely make it easier. Let $x = n$, where $n$ is a real number. The equation $2 \\clubsuit x = 81$ can be rewritten as $4n^2 + 4n + 4 = 81.$ The common factor of 4 can be factored out to get $4(n^2 + n + 1) = 81.$\nFactoring the quadratic expression gives $(n + 1)^2 = 81.$\nSo we get that $n + 1 = \\pm 9,$ which gives two possible values for $n$: $n = -8$ and $n = 8.$\nTherefore, the sum of all possible values of $x$ is $-8 + 8 = \\boxed{0}.$\nAuthor at Time of Posting: henr10\nSource: AoPS AMC 10A 1996\nTag(s): algebra",
