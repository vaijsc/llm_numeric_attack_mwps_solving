        " 40361\nSince $531^2-2\\cdot 531\\cdot530+530^2 = (531-530)^2$, the answer is said number squared, which is 531-530=1, so 1^2= \\boxed{1}.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 1. I hope it is correct. Viewing this answer explains why we can use the shortcut.\nThe expression in question is a difference of squares,\n$$a^2-b^2=(a+b)(a-b).$$So in this case, $a=531$ and $b=530$. Plugging these values into the expression above, we find\n$$531^2-2\\cdot 531\\cdot530+530^2=(531+530)(531-530)=(1061)(1)=\\boxed{1061}.$$The trick works for any difference of squares, no matter what the values of $a$ and $b$ are. This can be worked out by expanding $(a+b)^2$ and $(a-b)^2$:\n\\begin{align*}\n(a+b)^2&=a^2+2ab+b^2,\\\\\n(a-b)^2&=a^2-2ab+b^2.\n\\end{align*}The two expressions above are identical, except for the term $2ab$, which is positive when $a>b$, and negative when $a<b$. So, when $a>b$, $(a+b)^2$ contains a positive term, $2ab$, and $(a-b)^2$ does not. When $a<b$, $(a+b)^2$ contains a negative term, $-2ab$, and $(a-b)^2$ does. If we add the two expressions together, the positive term and the negative term cancel out, and the two functions are equal. This shortcut will work as long as we are working with differences of squares. It is the last row of a worked out problem.\n### Note:\nThe following diagram is a proof for the general case, of a difference of squares, which may be use to derive the final answer.\nLet $a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b)$.\n\\begin{align} a^2 - b^2 &= (a + b)(a - b) \\\\\na^2 - 2 a b + b^2 &= (a + b)(a - b) \\\\\n\\end{align}\nAnd so",

I have used the expanded version of the factoring formula for difference of squares $(a-b)^2=a^2-2ab+b^2$. The formula was very helpful in simplifying the square expression. However, the formula is not written, it has to be known using prior experience. In that case, the question might require it as a fact and eliminate this part as an answer. That would be a great challenge for students. To solve it without knowing the formula, you could expand the squares manually expanding the squares and combining like terms.

David Aldous: My first instinct was \"sums of squares\" and the answer \"1\" because the answer is zero. But I was (mis)instructed to evaluate $531^2 - 2\\cdot 531\\cdot 530 + 530^2$ instead of $531^2 + 531^2 - 2\\cdot 531\\cdot 530 - 530^2$ assuming that the original intention was a difference of squares. Ah well, maybe the problem was flawed to begin with? Saketh Kolla: This is a classic! It's just a difference of squares, $(p-q)^2=p^2-2pq+q^2$.\nOptimal Control tech plugin #### Denis P\u00f6tzelberger: Optimal Control tech plugin. hiremath: Hi Denis, Can we arrange an invite to Optimal Control tech? #### Denis P\u00f6tzelberger: Of course, you are invited.

I hope it is correct. \nIf we noticed this is a difference of squares of the form $a^2-b^2=(a+b)(a-b)$ then we can simplify it directly.\n### Problem 2: Evaluate $\\sin(\\pi/6) \\cdot \\cos(\\pi/3)$.\nUse the identity $\\sin(a-b)=\\sin(a)\\cos(b)-\\cos(a)\\sin(b)$ and observe that $\\pi/6-\\pi/3=-\\pi/6$. So we have $\\sin(\\pi/6-\\pi/3) = \\sin(\\pi/6)\\cos(\\pi/3)-\\cos(\\pi/6)\\sin(\\pi/3)$. We cannot get rid of trigonometric functions directly at this point.\nNow, we notice that $\\sin(\\pi/6)=1/2$ and $\\cos(\\pi/3)=1/2$ and $\\cos(\\pi/6)=\\sqrt{3}/2$ and $\\sin(\\pi/3)=\\sqrt{3}/2$. So we get $$(\\sin(\\pi/6)\\cdot\\cos(\\pi/3))-(\\cos(\\pi/6)\\cdot\\sin(\\pi/3))=\\frac12\\cdot\\frac12-\\frac{\\sqrt3}2\\cdot\\frac{\\sqrt3}2.$$We can simplify this formula by multiplying elements in each fraction: $$\\frac14-\\frac{3}{4}=\\frac14-\\frac34=\\boxed{\\frac12}.$$It is important to do each step as short as possible at this point so that we do not get confused by side-by-side calculations.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 1/2.
