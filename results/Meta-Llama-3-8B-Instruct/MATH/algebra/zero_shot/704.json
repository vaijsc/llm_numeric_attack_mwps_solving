        " 1. If k^{th} term of A is 5+(k-1)(-2) = 5-2k+2, then k^{th} term of B = 2^{5-2k+2}.  After re-arranging, that becomes 2^5 \\times 2^{(-2k+2)}. Now if we looked at the brasenos form of (2^{(-2k+2)}), we have 2^(-2k) \\times 2^2. Now we know that 2^2 = 4. So the expression simplifies to 2^5 \\times 2^{(-2k)} \\times 4.

All you need to do is to take your calculation and data and data about others. All of this information will then be put into training programs, which will help you improve your calculation capabilities. They are also used for assistance in calculation, suggest methods, and sometimes even help to compare figures. It's really interesting how we can benefit",
        " The infinite arithmetic sequence $A$ with first term $5$ and common difference $-2$ has the following form $A_k = 5 - 2(k-1)$.\nLet\u2019s add a little bit:\n$$A_k = 5 - 2(k-1) = 3 - 2k,$$from which we get $a = 3$ and $d = -2$. By the formula for the sum of terms of an arithmetic sequence, the sum of the terms of $A$ is\n$$\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} A_k = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} (3 - 2k) = 3\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty}1 - 2\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty}k.$$\nWe know that the sum of consecutive integers is equal to $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$. So, for our case we have\n$$2\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty}k = 2\\left(\\frac{1 + \\infty}{2}\\right) = \\infty$$\nand\n$$3\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty}1 = 3\\left(\\frac{\\infty}{1}\\right) = \\infty.$$\nSo, the limit of the sum as $k$ goes to $\\infty$ is\n$$\\lim_{k\\to\\infty}\\sum_{n=1}^k (3 - 2n) = \\lim_{k\\to\\infty}\\left(3k - 2\\sum_{n=1}^k n\\right) = \\lim_{k\\to\\infty}\\left(3k-2\\left(\\frac{k(k+1)}{2}\\right)\\right) = \\lim_{k\\to\\infty}(3k - k^2 - k) = \\lim_{k\\to\\infty}(-k^2)=-\\infty$$\nSo we can write\n$$\\lim_{k\\to\\infty}\\sum_{n=1}^k A_n = \\lim_{k\\to\\infty}\\left(3k - k^2 - k\\right) = \\lim_{k\\to\\infty}(-k^2)=-\\infty$$\nNow let\u2019s look at",
