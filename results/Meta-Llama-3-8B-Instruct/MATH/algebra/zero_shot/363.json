        " \\frac{3^4-3^3}{3^3-3^2} = 3\nThe numerator is 3 cubed minus 3 squared, i.e., $3^4-3^3 = 3^3(3-1) = 2\\cdot 3^3$.

If $\\lim_{x\\to a} \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$ is indeterminate, i.e., if it is not equal to either $0/0$ or $\\infty/\\infty$, then $\\lim_{x\\to a} \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \\lim_{x\\to a} \\frac{f^\\prime(x)}{g^\\prime(x)}$. This theorem can be used when the original problem of dividing two functions is not immediately solvable, but after taking the derivative of both functions, the limit becomes easily solvable. The theorem can also be used to solve other problems, such as finding the maximum or minimum values of a function. Final Answer: The final answer is L\u2019H\u00f4pital\u2019s Rule - Basic Theorem. I hope it is correct.  ### Furthermore, the question simplifies to $\\frac{3^3(3-1)}{3^2(3-1)} = \\boxed{3}$. We can also use L\u2019H\u00f4pital\u2019s Rule to simplify the problem, as we are indeed dealing with an indeterminate form of 1/1. In such cases, we can simply ignore the indeterminate form and multiply the numerator and denominator by $3^3+3^2$, the denominator of the original problem. This leads us to $\\frac{(3^3+3^2)(3-1)}{(",

        " \nFor this problem, we have to simplify the expression:\n$\\frac{3^4-3^3}{3^3-3^2} = \\frac{3^3(3-1)}{3^2(3-1)}=\\boxed{3}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 3. I hope it is correct.  #### Why do we have to solve this problem step by step? The instruction specifically asked us to \"compute\" the expression, not to simplify it. Therefore, we have to use the given expression as is, without trying to factor or cancel anything out at this stage. It's only after we have the full solution in the intermediate step that we can simplify the expression to its final form, which in this case is 3.  As an aside, problems like these often rely on the notion that we should follow the given instructions carefully, which might be considered a meta-instruction or a disclaimer. It's not always necessary to \"compute\" every expression step by step, but in cases where ambiguity may arise, following the instructions carefully can help avoid misunderstandings.  Can we solve this problem by factorizing? If we factor the numerator, we get:\n$\\frac{3^4-3^3}{3^3-3^2} = \\frac{3^3(3-1)}{3^2(3-1)}=\\boxed{3}$\nAnd if we factor the denominator, we get:\n$\\frac{3^4-3^3}{3^3-3^2} = \\frac{3^3(3-1)}{3^2(3-1)}=\\boxed{3}$\nIn this case, yes, we can solve the problem by factorizing. But what if the problem had involved more complex expressions? Factorization might not always be possible, and we would need to rely on other methods (like step-by-step computation) to find the solution.  We could try to solve the problem using other methods, such as using the quotient rule of divison, but in this case, the previous method (using factorization) is more intuitive and requires fewer steps.  There are many ways to solve a given problem, and the choice of method often depends on the complexity and structure of the problem, as well as on the individual solver's strengths and preferences. In this case, solving the problem through factorization is a reasonable and efficient approach.  Now, what about the \u201cwhy do",
