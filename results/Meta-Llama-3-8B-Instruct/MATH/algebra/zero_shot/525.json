        " From $h(2)=10$, we know that there exists $x_1$ such that $f(x_1)=2, h(x_1)=10$. Also, from $h(10)=1$ and $h(1)=2$, we know that there exists $x_2$ such that $f(x_2)=1, h(x_2)=10$.

        " Suppose that $h(x)=f^{-1}(x)$. If $h(2)=10$, $h(10)=1$ and $h(1)=2$, what is $f(f(10))$?\nTranslating the questions to our notation, we obtain $f^{-1}(2) = 10$, $f^{-1}(10) = 1$ and $f^{-1}(1) = 2$. We can write out $f(x)$ as an inequality by replacing each of the non-dependent variables to the original values. This means we can substitute $y$ with $10$ and $1$:\n$$y = f(x) = f(f^{-1}(2)) = f(10) = y$$by the original values, and $$y = f(x) = f(f^{-1}(10)) = f(1) = 2$$by the original values. Therefore, there are two preliminary CP functions:\n$$f(x) = f^{-1}(y) = \\begin{cases} 10 & \\mbox{if } y = 2 \\\\ 2 & \\mbox{if } y = 10 \\end{cases}$$\nBut the problem is describing $f$\u2019s inverse $h(x) = f^{-1}(x)$, so we just switched and updated $x$ and $y$.\nNow we can define the second function to obtain a well-defined definition of $f$, which we will now say $g(x)$:\n$$f(x) = \\begin{cases} 10 & \\mbox{if } x = 2 \\\\ 1 & \\mbox{if } x = 10 \\\\ 10 & \\mbox{if } x = 1 \\\\ \\mbox{undefined} & \\mbox{otherwise} \\end{cases}$$\nUsing this definition, we can find that $f(f(10))$ is equal to $f(1) = 2$. The answer is $\\boxed{2}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2. I hope it is correct. I made an explicit formulation of a double-valued function that is by no means the only option.

        " We know $f^{-1}(2)=10$.  Since $f(f(10))=2$, $f(10)$ is an element of the domain $A$ of $f^{-1}$.  Let\u2019s guess a functional recursion proposition, i.e. $$f(x) = g(x,g(x,g(f^{-1}(2),f(x))))$$  As a result, for an element $u$ of $A$, $$f(u) = g(u,g(g^{-1}(2),f(u))).$$  If we set $u=10$, we will get $f(10)=g(10,g(g^{-1}(2),f(10)))$, i.e. \\begin{align*} f(10)&=g(10,g(1,f(10))). \\end{align*}  Then, by letting $f(10)=\\alpha$, we will get $f(\\alpha)=g(\\alpha,g(1,\\alpha))$.
