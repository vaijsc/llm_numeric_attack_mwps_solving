I hope it is correct.  If $-6 \\leq a \\leq -2$, then $-2 \\leq -a \\leq 6$. Since $-2$ is a lower bound of $-a$, we get a smaller bound when we use the maximum of $-6$ as our lower bound, giving $a = -6$. Similarly, since $6$ is an upper bound of $-a$, we get a smaller bound when we use the minimum of $2$ as our upper bound, giving $-a = 2$. Combining them together makes $-6 \\leq a \\leq -2$ simplifies to $-6 \\leq a \\leq 2$.\nSince $3 \\leq b \\leq 5$, then $0 \\leq \\frac{1}{b} \\leq \\frac{2}{3}$. If we simplify and combine the constraints, we get $-6 \\leq a \\leq 2$ and $0 \\leq \\frac{1}{b} \\leq \\frac{2}{3}$. Simplifying $(a + \\frac{1}{b})(\\frac{1}{b} - a)$ using FOIL, we get $(a)(\\frac{1}{b} \u2013 a) + \\frac{1}{b} = \u2013 a^2 + \\frac{a}{b} + \\frac{1}{b}$. Since $-6 \\leq a \\leq 2$, the greatest value that $-a^2$ can be is when $a = 2$ and the greatest value that $\\frac{1}{b}$ can be is when $b = 3$, so $(a)(\\frac{1}{b} \u2013 a) + \\frac{1}{b} = \u2013 4 + 1 + \\frac{1}{3}$ = -3 + $\\frac{1}{3}$.

        " The simplest way to approach this problem is to first simplify. We can use FOILing. Let $y = \\left(a+\\frac{1}{b}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{b}-a\\right)$ to make it easier.

So we can see that 1/b is the maximum value.\n#### Comment:\nNice solution! For our exam, we can try instead of simplifying y = a^2 - (a-1)/b + 1/b^2 - 1, we could just focus on the negative term because a^2 is always nonnegative and 1/b^2 is always positive, and 1/b is also positive. So the maximum value will be - (a-1)/b+ 1/b^2. Now, a-1 is negative, so - (a-1)/b is positive and since 1/b^2 is positive, the sum will be greater than -1/b, and the maximum value will be 1/b. Since this is what we got at the end, we could have done this. For the exam, I would recommend to take a look at what we did at the beginning and try a problem for 5 points and see what negative and positive numbers we get at the beginning.

To get the greatest value, we use the fact that $-2\\leq a\\leq -6$. But then the greatest value of $a^2$ will be $36$.  So it is maximum. And $0\\leq\\frac{1}{b}\\leq\\frac{6}{5}$.  Because $a$ is negative and $\\frac{1}{b}$ is positive, the product $a \\left(\\frac{1}{b} - a\\right)$ will be maximum when $a$ is smallest.  We can then calculate that the maximum value is $\\frac{14}{25}$.  So $\\boxed{\\frac{14}{25}}$ is the answer.  It is also expressed in fractions. \n(I hope it is what you want?) s\u00fcresi: 10 dakika.  Also yes, I include the simplified fraction.  That's better.

I hope it is correct.  (Not sure of this so you put None but the answer must be\\frac{93}{25}.)  Next time.  For your second line when you divide a fraction by a fraction, you might as well place the fraction bar over the division as do when you are dividing the two totally.  Example $$\\frac{a}{b}+\\frac{c}{d}$$-In either is a + c is exactly just something like in reply-initially of division of  a plus c over the second number, It is where that the best way to divide two fractions.  To sum up, \\frac{a}{b}+\\frac{c}{d}=\\frac{a \\times d+c \\times b}{b \\times d}, To simplify we need to go to both parts on get a ideal factor to a easier number. at any time $a + b \\ geq \\left|a\\right|+\\left|b\\right| \\ geq \\left|a-b\\right|$. That will eventually remove complexities. $$\\displaystyle\\left(a+\\frac{1}{b}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{b}-a\\right)$$ to simplify, we must express the factor\n  1. Simplifying a + (1/b) := -2 + (1/(5))\n  2. Simplifying 1/(b) - a := (31/5)\nNow, to find product $\\left(a+\\frac{1}{b}\\",
        " Step 1:\nFind the greatest possible value of the numerator.\nThe value of $a$ is less than or equal to $-2$ and $b$ is greater than or equal to 3, so the maximum value of $a+\\frac{1}{b}$ will occur when $a=-2$ and $b=3$. Therefore, the greatest possible value of $a+\\frac{1}{b}$ is $-2 + \\frac{1}{3}=\\frac{-5}{3}$.\nStep 2:\nFind the greatest possible value of the denominator.\nThe value of $a$ is less than or equal to $-2$ and $b$ is greater than or equal to 3, so the minimum value of $\\frac{1}{b}-a$ will occur when $a=-2$ and $b=5$. Therefore, the smallest possible value of $\\frac{1}{b}-a$ is $\\frac{1}{5}+2=\\frac{7}{5}$.\nStep 3:\nPlug the values into the expression:\nThe greatest possible value of the expression is $\\left(\\frac{-5}{3}\\right)\\left(\\frac{7}{5}\\right)=\\boxed{\\frac{-7}{15}}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\frac{-7}{15}. I hope it is correct.  It is easy to calculate.$$\\left(a+\\frac{1}{b}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{b}-a\\right) =a^2-\\frac{a}{b}+\\frac{1}{b^2}$$We need to maximize this expression given the constraints of $-6\\leq a \\leq -2$ and $3 \\leq b \\leq 5$.  This will be maximized by minimizing the first term and maximizing the second two terms.  This occurs at $a=-2$ and $b=5$, in which case the expression simplifies to:$$\\left(-2+\\frac{1}{5}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{5}-(-2)\\right)=\\frac{-7}{15}$$\nAuthor: Fran Liang\nSource: Aops\nLink: https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/2020_AIME_I_Problems/Problem_14",
        " First we have to determine the possible values of $\\displaystyle\\left(a+\\frac{1}{b}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{b}-a\\right)$, which we will denote by $x$.  Since $-6\\leq a \\leq -2$, the term $a$ is negative.  Also since $3 \\leq b \\leq 5$, the terms $\\frac{1}{b}$ are between 0.5 and 0.2, which are positive.  This means that both of the factors in the product $x$ are positive.  The product of two positive numbers is also positive, therefore, $x$ is also positive.\nWe want to maximize this product $x$ such that its first and second factors are positive, therefore, we need to minimize the difference between the two factors, but both of the factors are being multiplied, this means we need to make them closer together.  The maximum possible difference of these two factors can be achieved when $\\frac{1}{b}$ and $a$ are the closest, but we know they are positive.  The closer they are, the closest we can get, this means $a$ should be as close to $\\frac{1}{b}$ as possible.\nIf $a$ was a little bit closer to $\\frac{1}{b}$ than not, we would obtain a product that could still be bigger, but this would mean $a$ would be even closer, which we can\u2019t, it\u2019s already at its maximum.  From this reasoning, we obtain that the maximum value for $a$ is $\\frac{1}{5}$, and also that $b$ must be 5, because if it\u2019s 3 then $\\frac{1}{b}$ will be 1/3 and $a$ will be -1.6 and we are trying to maximize the value not minimize it.  Therefore, the maximum value for the given product $x$ is $\\left(\\frac{1}{5}+\\frac{1}{5}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{5}-\\frac{1}{5}\\right)=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{25}}$./></center>\nPlease be clear, the problem has no logical meaning.  I will have a discussion on this. We have to take the problem as given and solve it.\nThis is a nice problem, and the student solved it by identifying the maximum value and then completing the square. I"
