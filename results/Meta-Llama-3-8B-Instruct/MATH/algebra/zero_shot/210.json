        " We know that the sum of the measures of all four interior angles of a quadrilateral is equal to $360^{\\circ}$. If the sum of the measures of these angles is given by an arithmetic sequence, then if $a$ is the first term, $a+d$ is the second term, $a+2d$ is the third term, and $a+3d$ is the fourth term, we know that\n$$a+(a+d)+(a+2d)+(a+3d)=360,$$so that $$4a+6d=360.$$If $a+3d=129$, then we can rewrite the above equation as\n$$4(a+3d)-6d=360,$$and thus\n\\begin{align*}\n4a+12d-6d&=360\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 4a+6d&=360\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad a+3d&=\\frac{360}{4}=90\\qquad\\text{(equation is satisfied)}.\n\\end{align*}It now follows that $a+2d+a+3d=90+d+129=360^{\\circ}$, so that $d=81^{\\circ}$, and the second largest angle is $a+2d=a+2(81)=a+162^{\\circ}$, so that this angle is $90^{\\circ}+162^{\\circ}=\\boxed{252^{\\circ}}$.\u202212.18: Consider two nonempty sets $S$ and $T$.

        " The solution is: 108\\deg\nThis one is relatively self-explanatory. Since the interior angles of a quadrilateral form an arithmetic sequence, and the measure of the largest angle is $129^{\\circ}$, then the measures of the other three angles are of the form $$129 - 3 k, 129 - k, 129 + k, 129 + 3 k.$$Therefore, the second largest angle is $129 - k$, which we need to find.  Note that $$129 + k + 129 - k + 129 - 3 k + 129 + 3 k = 4 \\cdot 129$$which tells us that we can express $k$ as a function of $129$: $$129 - k + 129 + k + 129 - 3 k + 129 + 3 k = 129 \\cdot 4$$ $$3 \\cdot 129 = k \\cdot (3) + k \\cdot (1) + k \\cdot (1)$$ $$k = \\frac{3 \\cdot 129}{3} = \\boxed{129}$$This gives us the value of $k$, which we now need to find $k$ for our expression so that we can find the measure of the second largest angle.  Now we can use our expression to solve for the measure of the second largest angle: $$129 - k = 129 - 129 = \\boxed{108}\\deg$$We need to subtract because we need to subtract and not add because $129$ is greater than $k$.\n### Second ",
        " The four angles of a quadrilateral add up to $360^{\\circ}$.  So the sum of the four angles is\n$$(x)+(x+d)+(x+2d)+(x+3d)=360.$$If we simplify this equation, we get\n$$4x+6d=360\\Rightarrow 2x+3d=180.$$  Since we know the measure of the largest angle is $129^{\\circ}$, we are looking for the second largest angle.  Let $x$ denote this angle.  Thus,\n\\begin{align*}\nx&=x+d\\\\\n&=129^{\\circ}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow x&=129^{\\circ}.\n\\end{align*}We also know that $x+3d=180^{\\circ}$.  Therefore, $3d=180^{\\circ}-129^{\\circ}=51^{\\circ}$.  Hence, $d=17^{\\circ}$.  Finally, we can find the measures of the four angles:\n\\begin{align*}\nx &= 129^{\\circ},\\\\\nx+d &=129^{\\circ}+17^{\\circ}=146^{\\circ},\\\\\nx+2d&=129^{\\circ}+2\\cdot17^{\\circ}=164^{\\circ},\\\\\nx+3d&=129^{\\circ}+3\\cdot17^{\\circ}=\\boxed{180^{\\circ}}.\n\\end{align*}\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 180^{\\circ}.

        " Let $x$ be the common difference of the arithmetic sequence of angles. Then, we have\n$$x + (x + y) + (x + 2y) + 129^{\\circ} = 360^{\\circ},$$\nwhere $x + y$ is the second largest angle, so that $x + 2y$ is the smallest angle and $x$ is the intermediate one. Simplifying the equation, we find\n$$3x + 3y = 231^{\\circ}.$$\nHence, $x + y = 77^{\\circ}$.\nWe need to know what $x$ is. Since $x$ increases by 1 to $x + y$, then $y = 2x$, and plugging in to the previous equation yields\n$$3x + 6x = 231^{\\circ} \\Rightarrow 9x = 231^{\\circ} \\Rightarrow x = 77^{\\circ}/3 = 25.67^{\\circ}.$$\nSo, $y = 2x = 51.34^{\\circ}$. But, this value is approximate, since $y$ must be an integer. Since $y = 2x$, it can be only integer when $x = 24^{\\circ}$ (and $y = 48^{\\circ}$).

        " Let's denote the measure of the largest angle by $x$.  Since the interior angles of the quadrilateral form an arithmetic sequence, we can let $x - d$ and $x - 2d$ be the measures of the second largest angle and the smallest angle, respectively.\nWe also know that the interior angles of a quadrilateral sum up to $360^{\\circ}$.  Therefore,\n\\begin{align*}\nx + (x - d) + (x - 2d) + (x - 3d) &= 360\\\\\n4x - 6d &= 360.\n\\end{align*}We can also substitute $x = 129^{\\circ}$ and rewrite the equation as $4 \\cdot 129^{\\circ} - 6d = 360,$ which can be simplified to $516^{\\circ} - 6d = 360$ and then $6d = 516^{\\circ} - 360 = 156^{\\circ}$, before solving for $d$ as $d = 156^{\\circ}/6 = 26^{\\circ}$.\nThe measure of the second largest angle, in degrees, is therefore $\\boxed{103^{\\circ}}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 103. I hope it is correct.  Source: AoPS. \nI hope it is correct. Let me know if you need anything else. ",
        " \nLet $x$ be the angle common difference to the sequence. First, we have that $x$ is the difference between the second largest angle and the smallest angle. We know that $$x=129^{\\circ}-b,$$where $b$ is the smallest angle.\nThen, we have that $x$ is also equal to the difference between the largest angle and the third largest angle. We know that $$x=129^{\\circ}-c,$$where $c$ is the third largest angle.\nSince $x$ is equal to both of these expressions, we have $129^{\\circ}-b=129^{\\circ}-c$, so $b=c.$\nWe know that $b+c+129^{\\circ}$ is a straight angle, which is $180^{\\circ},$ so $b+c=51^{\\circ}$, and the second largest angle is $\\boxed{51^{\\circ}}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 51^{\\circ}. I hope it is correct.",

        " Solving the problem\nLet $x$ be the interior angle that is the biggest. The second biggest angle is $x - 12$, and the other two have angle measures of $x-24$. This is an Arithmetic Sequence. To find the sum of these angles, we use the formula:\n$$x + x - 12 + x - 24 + x - 36 = 4x - 72$$\nSince we know that the sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is $360^{\\circ}$, we set $4x - 72 = 360$ and solve for $x$:\n\\begin{align*}\n4x - 72 &= 360 \\\\\n4x &= 432 \\\\\nx &= \\boxed{108^{\\circ}}\n\\end{align*}\nThe second biggest angle is $x - 12$, which is $108^{\\circ} - 12^{\\circ} = \\boxed{96^{\\circ}}$.\n### Answer: 96 degrees\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 96. I hope it is correct.\u00a0 \nWe just need to calculate $x - 12$, which is the measure of the second largest angle, as $x - 12 = 129^{\\circ} - 12^{\\circ} = \\boxed{96^{\\circ}}$.\u00a0 \nI hope this clears up any confusion.

        " \nLet $x$ be the largest angle.\nThen, the next biggest angle is $x - 3$, the next one is $x - 6$, and the last one is $x - 9$.\nWe know that \\begin{align*}\n    x + (x - 3) + (x - 6) + (x - 9) &= 360, \\\\\n    4x - 18 &= 360, \\\\\n    4x &= 378, \\\\\n    x &= 94.5.\n\\end{align*} But angles must be between 0 and 180.  Therefore, we are fitting all our work in a new set, \\begin{align*}\n    x + (x - 3) + (x - 6) + (x - 9) &= 360, \\\\\n    4x - 18 &= 360, \\\\\n    4x &= 378, \\\\\n    x &= 94.5, \\\\\n    x &= 93, \\\\\n    x &= 94, \\\\\n    x &= 95.\n\\end{align*}Clearly, 94 and 95 aren\u2019t in between 0 and 180.
