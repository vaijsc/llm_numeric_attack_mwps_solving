        " First, note that the expression inside the absolute value sign, namely $x$, will always be positive, so we can take its cube without changing its sign. Thus,\n\\begin{align*}\nx\\clubsuit y=|x|^3+y&=8+y\\qquad\\textrm{when}\\,\\,x=2\\\\\n&=\\boxed{10}\n\\end{align*}\n### Reference:\nThis problem in MAA\u2019s American Mathematics Competitions.\nResource: AMC 10/12 Practice Problems by AoPS.",
        " We are given the operation $\\clubsuit$.\nWe must evaluate $x\\clubsuit y$ where $x=2$, $y=4$.\n### Step 1: When we have variable $x$, what is $|x|$?\nThe absolute value of a number gives the non-negative value of that number. For example, $|5|=5$, $|-5|=5$. For $x=2$, $|2|=2$. For $x=-2$, $|-2|=2$. Because there are no negative numbers in real numbers, we will assume $2$ because of the step value of $2$.\n### Step 2: What is $|x|^3$?\nThe formula given is $|x|^3$ which means we square $|x|$ and then square the result. This is equivalent to squaring $x$ in real numbers. We have $|x|=2$, so squaring gives $4$, and again squaring $4$ gives $16$.\n### Step 3: Now, we must add $y$.\n### Step 3:2: What is $y$?\nWe are given $y=4$.\n### Step 4: Adding $y$ to the result.\nWe have $4+4=8$ so the final answer is $\\boxed{8}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 8. I hope it is correct.  [[[heavy_rain]]]",
        " To compute $2\\clubsuit4$, we first need to compute the magnitude of $2$, which is just $|2| = 2$. Then, we substitute $x=2$ and $y=4$ into the definition:\n$$2\\clubsuit4=|2|^3+4=\\boxed{8+4=12}$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 12. I hope it is correct. Let\u2019s think step by step.\n### "
