        " So, let\u2019s analyze this given information: The set $$x \\in \\{2\\}$$\nThe point $(2,9)$ must lie on the graph of $y=f(x)$.\n### This implies $f(2) = 9$\nNow, recall that $f(-x)$ represents the reflection of $f(x)$ through the $y$-axis. So, we know that $f(x) = f(-(-x))$. For each $x$, the corresponding value of $f(x)$ is the same as the corresponding value of $f(-x)$ but the $x$-value itself is negative.\nSince we want the point $(a,b)$ to lie on the graph of $y=f(-x)$, then we require an $x$ for which $f(-x)=b$.\nUsing the information $f(2)=9$, we can rewrite it as $$f(-2)=9$$ The pair $(-2,9)$ must also lie on the graph of $y = f(-x)$.

That is, when we plot $(x,y)$ on the graph, we also have the point $(-x,y)$, $(-x,f(-x))$, on the graph of $y=f(x)$.\n### Explanation: Therefore, when $(2,9)$ is on the graph of $y=f(x)$, we also have the point $(-2,9)$ on the graph of $y=f(x)$. Since $f(-x)$ means we reverse the $x$-coordinate but keep the $y$-coordinate, we must also have $(2,9)$ on the graph of $y=f(-x)$, the point we are looking for.\n### ",

So, we can easily find out that the point $(2,9)$ lies on $y=f(-(-2))$ as well, by rewriting $-(-2)=2$. In fact, there\u2019s exactly one point $(2,9)$ for the point $(x,y)$ $\\in R^{2}$ on the graph of $y=f(-x)$, which is $(x, y) = (-2,9)$ as well.

        " Since the point $(2,9)$ lies on the graph $y=f(x),$ this tells us $f(2)=9$. Then we know that $(2,9)$ is a maximum or minimum value of our function $f(x)$ because a point higher or lower than that can be obtained from it by adding 1, 2, 3, etc. So, either $f(x)$ is an increasing function and $f(x)$ has a maximum at $x=2,$ or $f(x)$ is a decreasing function and $f(x)$ has a minimum at $x=2$. For simplicity, let\u2019s take the case when $f(x)$ is decreasing. Then $f(0) is the smaller value. Note that $\\left(-2,-9\\right)$ lies on the graph of $y=f(-x)$ because we replaced $x$ with $-x$ but not the sign. Therefore, we can conclude that $\\boxed{\\left(-2,-9\\right)}$ is the point which must be on the graph of $y=f(-x)$. The sum of that point\u2019s coordinates is $\\boxed{-11}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -11. I hope it is correct.  mum I need to explain this question in more detail simply because my previous explanation was not enough. Okay!\nLet $f$ be a function such that the point (2,9) is on the graph of $y=f(x)$. Now, we know that $f(2)=9$. The point (2,9) could be the maximum or minimum value of $f(x)$. In the case when $f(x)$ is increasing, there could be a point higher than (2,9), but that\u2019s not relevant here. So, we can just ignore that and consider the other case when $f(x)$ is decreasing.\nWhen $f(x)$ is decreasing, then $f(x)$ must have a maximum at $x=2$. Since $f(x)$ is decreasing, we know that $f(x)\\to-\\infty$ as $x\\to-\\infty$. Therefore, we have $f(0)>f(2)=9$. Since $f(x)$ is decreasing, we have $f(x)<f(0)$ for all $x>0$. So, we can say that the maximum value of $f(x)$ is $f(0)$, which is greater than $f(2)=9$. We don\u2019t",
        " Suppose that $(2,9)$ is on the graph of $y=f(x)$. Then $9=f(2)$. Since the point $(-2,9)$ must be on the graph of $y=f(-x)$ as a result of a reflection over the $y$-axis, $\\boxed{(-2)+9=-1+9}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 8. I hope it is correct. Additional Note: This problem doesn\u2019t require us to know what the actual function $f(x)$ is. All we need to know is that if $(2,9)$ is on the graph of $y=f(x)$, then $(2,9)$ will reflect over the $y$-axis to become $(-2,9)$ which must also be on the graph of $y=f(-x)$. This general principal works with any function that is not dependent on real numbers (non-real multiples, e.g., imaginary numbers, do not work).  Thus, the coordinates sum to -1+9 = 8.

        " By definition, we know that $f(2) = 9.$ We also know that $f(-x)$ is the reflection of $f(x)$ over the $y$-axis. This means that $f(-2)$ must be on the graph of $y=f(-x)$.\n### ",
        " The Reflection of $(2,9)$\nIf we have a point $(2,9)$, we can reflect it across the $y$-axis by changing the $x$-coordinate to $-2$.\nSo, we have $(\\boxed{-2},9)$.\n### Solution:\nThat's all. $-2+9=\\boxed{7}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 7. I hope it is correct.  ### Additional Note: An efficient way to convert $y=f(-x)$ is to replace $x$ with $-x$ inside $y=f(x)$. So, for $(2,9)$, it becomes $y=f(-2)=9$, that is, $(-2,9)$. Always remember that reflecting across the $y$-axis is just a matter of changing sign for $x$ in the $xy$-plane, or in the functional notation, it is $-x$. Lastly, the (x,y) point in $f(x)$ becomes $(-x,y)$ in $f(-x)$. Example: In $f(x)$, the point $(4,2)$ becomes $(2,4)$ in $f(-x)$. The reflection over the $y$-axis of $(4,2)$ is $(\\boxed{-4},2)$. Remember that this concept applies to points in the $xy$-plane and functional notation. You have to change the sign for $x$ in both situation. This logic can be taken to the graphing of equations, too. Example: Reflect the equation $y=x^2$ across the $y$-axis. Just replace $x$ with $-x$ and you will get $y=(-x)^2$ which means the graph of $y=f(-x)$ is the flipped version of the graph of $y=f(x)$. Therefore, it's easy to find the reflected point and then add the corresponding y-coordinates to find the answer. This is the additive thinking. You should cultivate this skill in various areas like algebra, geometry, and calculus. Final Answer: The final answer is 7. I hope it is correct.

Now, we want to consider $y=f(-x)$. Plugging in $x = -2$, we get $f(-2)=9$. So, the point $(-2,9)$ is on the graph of $y=f(-x)$. The sum of its coordinates is $\\boxed{-2+9=7}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 7.

That means we need the value of $-2$ in the original equation of $y=f(x)$, but the original value must be flipped, which is $-9$. Then, we get:\n\\begin{align*}\nf(-2)&=-9\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\,y&=-9,\\,x=-2\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\,[x,y]&=[-2,-9].\n\\end{align*}So, the final answer is $(-2)+(-9)=\\boxed{-11}$.\nSo, the sum of the coordinates is $\\boxed{-11}$.",

Next, let\u2019s consider the graph of $y=f(-x)$. So, we replace $x$ with $-x$ to get $y=f(-x)$.  Now, we need to plug the value of $2$ in the place of $-x$.  This means we need to plug in $-2$ instead of $x$.  So, we see that $y=f(-x)=f(-2)$. We are given that the point $(2,9)$ is on $y=f(x)$. Therefore, we can say that:\n\\begin{align*}\nf(2)&=9\\\\\nf(-2)&=9\\quad \\text{(because it is the same function form converted to $-x$)}\n\\end{align*}Hence, we can conclude that $(x,f(-x))=(-2,9)$ is a point on the graph of $y=f(-x)$.

        " Given $(2,9)$ is on the graph, it means that $f(2)=9$. In other words, when we evaluate $f(x)$ at $x=2$, we get $9$.\nNow, we are asked to find out the point that must be on the graph of $y=f(-x)$ and the sum of whose coordinates we want to know.\nLet us recall that when $y=f(x)$, it represents a function. This function is the set of inputs (or $x$-values) and their corresponding outputs (or $y$-values). When we substitute $x$ with $-x$, we are essentially reflecting the plot of the function across the y-axis and change the sign of the $x$-value.\nNow, our unknown point $(a,b)$ is such that $-x=a$, i.e., $x=-a$. For this $x$-value, we plug it into $f(-x)=f(a)$, and get $f(a)=b$.\nNow, you are wondering how this relates to the point $(2,9)$. We know that $f(2)=9$. Ah, yes! When we change the sign of $x$, we should get the same output, because we are still on the same function. Hence, $f(-2)=9$ as well, and so the sum of $(a,b)$\u2019s coordinates is $\\boxed{-2+9=\\boxed{7}}$.\nQED",

        " We can evaluate $f(2)=9$.\nThis tells us that $f(-2)=9$ as well.\n### Explanation: Since point $(2,9)$ is on the graph of $y=f(x)$, we get $f(2)=9.$ By definition, if a point is on a graph, its coordinates match the point\u2019s coordinates on the graph.\nNow, note that if we plug $-x$ in the function, we automatically get the point symmetric about the $y$-axis. Here, this means since we know $f(2)=9$, we can find $f(-2)$ as follows:\n\\begin{align*}\nf(-2)&=f(2) \\tag{ symmetry about y-axis }\\\\\n&=9\n\\end{align*}\nThe coordinates of the point are $(-2,9).$ Therefore, the sum of the point\u2019s coordinates is $\\boxed{-2 + 9 = 7}$.",
        " Step 1: Identifying f(-x). We are given that the point (2,9) is on the graph of y=f(x). So, according to the definition of function, 9=f(2). Thus, by the definition of composition, f(-x)=f(-2). We know that 9=f(2) and since the graph of y=f(x) is symmetric about the y-axis, 9 also =f(-2). Therefore, f(-2)=9. To determine if there is a point that must be on the graph of y=f(-x), we know that f(-x) is a reflection of f(x) about the y-axis. Therefore, we must have a point (2,9) for f(x). And the reflection of this point about the y-axis to y=f(-x) is (-2,9). ###\nFinal Answer: The final answer is (sum of coordinates)=(-2)+9=7. I hope it is correct.",
