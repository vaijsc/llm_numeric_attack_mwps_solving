    "solution": "Moving all the terms to the left, we have the equation $x^2-14x+y^2-48y=0$. Completing the square on the quadratic in $x$, we add $(14/2)^2=49$ to both sides. Completing the square on the quadratic in $y$, we add $(48/2)^2=576$ to both sides. We have the equation  \\[(x^2-14x+49)+(y^2-48y+576)=625 \\Rightarrow (x-7)^2+(y-24)^2=625\\] Rearranging, we have $(y-24)^2=625-(x-7)^2$. Taking the square root and solving for $y$, we get $y=\\pm \\sqrt{625-(x-7)^2}+24$. Since $\\sqrt{625-(x-7)^2}$ is always nonnegative, the maximum value of $y$ is achieved when we use a positive sign in front of the square root. Now, we want the largest possible value of the square root. In other words, we want to maximize $625-(x-7)^2$. Since $(x-7)^2$ is always nonnegative, $625-(x-7)^2$ is maximized when $(x-7)^2=0$ or when $x=7$. At this point, $625-(x-7)^2=625$ and $y=\\sqrt{625}+24=49$. Thus, the maximum $y$ value is $\\boxed{49}$.\n\n--OR--\n\nSimilar to the solution above, we can complete the square to get the equation $(x-7)^2+(y-24)^2=625$. This equation describes a circle with center at $(7,24)$ and radius $\\sqrt{625}=25$. The maximum value of $y$ is achieved at the point on the top of the circle, which is located at $(7,24+25)=(7,49)$. Thus, the maximum value of $y$ is $\\boxed{49}$.",

        " The equation $(x^2+y^2)-(14x+48y)=0$ is equivalent to the equation $(x-7)^2+(y-24)^2=625$.\nNow, observe that $(x-7)^2+(y-24)^2=(\\sqrt{(x-7)^2+(y-24)^2})^2=(x-7)^2+2(x-7)(y-24)+(y-24)^2$. Thus, the ordered pair $(x,y)$ satisfies $$(x-7)^2+2(x-7)(y-24)+(y-24)^2=625.$$This is a quadratic of the form $x^2+2xy+y^2=(x+y)^2$, so $x+y=25$.

We can notice that $x^2+y^2=14x+48y$ can be written as $$(x-7)^2+(y-24)^2=340,$$ where all 3 terms are positive. If we let $k$ be the maximum $y$ value, we have a number that is the distance of the point $(7,24+k)$ from $(7,24)$, which is $(7,24+k)-(0,24)=\\langle 7,k\\rangle$. Thus, $(7,k)^2=340$, which simplifies to $7^2+k^2=340$. By the triangle inequality, we have $$k<\\sqrt{340-7^2}=\\boxed{11.17}$$ Final Answer: The final answer is 11.17. I hope it is correct.

        " \nLet us complete the squares for $x^2$ and $y^2$. We find: \\begin{align*}\nx^2+y^2&=14x+48y\\\\\n(x-7)^2-49+(y-24)^2-576&=14x+48y\\\\\n(x-7)^2+(y-24)^2&=625\n\\end{align*}The last equation is the equation of a circle with center at $(7,24)$ and radius $25$. Hence, its diameter is $50$. The maximum value of $y$ occurs when $x$ is as small as possible. The $x$-value can only decrease in value if the circle in the plane is rotated counterclockwise. This is, as we would expect, since points with small $x$-values occur closer to the $y$-axis. When the circle has been rotated to point its diameter toward the negative-$x$ direction, its maximum $y$-value has been achieved. This maximum occurs when $x$ is $7-25=-18$, at $y$-value $24+50=74$.

        " Here is a step by step explanation for your question.\n### Step 1: Write the Quadratic Equation\nThe quadratic equation is known as $x^2+y^2=14x+48y$. Let\u2019s keep this equation in this form.\n### Step 2: Compress the Equation\nSo the equation is: $(x^2-14x)+(y^2-48y)=0$. Let\u2019s compress the equation by grouping the terms together as follows: $(x^2-14x+49)+(y^2-48y+144)=49+144$. Let\u2019s simplify the right side as follows: $(x^2-14x+49)+(y^2-48y+144)=193$. Let\u2019s write this in the simpler form: $(x-7)^2+(y-24)^2=193$. Now we have a nice form for the equation.\n### Step 3: The Quadratic Formula\nSince we have a sum of squares we know that both terms are positive. We have a circle with center at $(7,24)$. Every point on this circle satisfies the equation $(x-7)^2+(y-24)^2=193$.\n### Step 4: Calculate the Radius\nTo calculate the radius of the circle let\u2019s subtract 49 and 144 from both sides as follows: $(x-7)^2+(y-24)^2=193-49-144$. This simplifies as follows: $(x-7)^2+(y-24)^2=0$. Now subtracting 7 and 24 from both sides, we get: $(x-7)^2+(y-24)^2=(0-7)^2+(0-24)^2$. This simplifies as follows: $(x-7)^2+(y-24)^2=65$. Therefore the radius of the circle is 65.\n### Step 5: Find the Maximum Value of Y\nThe maximum value of $y$ occurs when $x$ is the minimum value. Therefore, when $x=7$ (which is the x-coordinate of the center), the maximum value of $y$ is $24+65=89$.\n### Answer: The final answer is 89.

        " From $x^2+y^2=14x+48y$, if we express all terms using $y$, we have:$$x^2+(48y-y^2)=14x$$ Taking $y$ as an input (although it\u2019s not really an input, it will be useful for us) and $x$ as an output, we can imagine a function. As $y$ increases and $x^2$ can only decrease. If $y \\to \\infty$, $x^2\\to 0$, so let $x=\\sqrt{a(y)},$ where $a(y)=14y$.\nThen our equation simplifies at $$y^2+(48y-y^2)=14y \\Rightarrow y=\\frac{-14+\\sqrt{(-14)^2+4\\cdot 1\\cdot (-7)^2}}{2}=\\frac{7-\\sqrt{49}}{1}=3.5$$$\\color{brown}{y=3.5}$So our function $y=f(x)$ is:$$f(x)=y=-48\\frac{1}{2}+\\sqrt{48y}=y$$Finally, this function is in $x$ terms,$$f(x)=y=-48\\frac{1}{2}+\\sqrt{14x}=y$$and finally, we evaluate this for the values of $x$ in terms of $y$ like:$$f(x)=y=7\\underbrace{+\\sqrt{a(y)}}_{14}-7=7+\\sqrt{14y}-7=14-7=7$$Taking the square of both sides of $y=7$,$$y^2=(7)^2=49$$Applying $y=3.5$ and deciding an approximation,$$y^2=3.5^2=12.25$$we can compare it to the actual range of $y$ in the said equation which is:$$y^2+(48y-y^2)=14y \\Rightarrow y^2-14y+49=0$$for: \\begin{align*} &\\Rightarrow (y-7)^2=0 \\Rightarrow y \\in [0, 7] \\\\ &\\color{red}{[0,7]} \\end{align*}\nIt is shown that the previous term $12.25$ exceeds 49 while $3.5$ satisfies it,$$12.25 > 49 \\Rightarrow f(x)",

        " The equation is an equation of an ellipse where $x$ and $y$ are the coordinates of a point on the ellipse.  From this, we can know that the sum of the two squares given as $x^2$ and $y^2$ equals $14x$ plus $48y$.\nThis tells us that $\\boxed{(x-7)^2 + (y-24)^2 =289,}$  for $(x,y)$, which specifies where it must be located.  The equation of an ellipse with the given equation, whose center is on $(7,24)$.\nFrom there we must recognize $\\boxed{(x-7)^2} + \\boxed{(y-24)^2} = \\boxed{(x-7)^2} + \\boxed{(y-24)^2} =289.  Since we know this is the equation of an ellipse, this tells us that the maximum and minimum of $y$ must be found along the perimeter of the ellipse.  The maximum point of an ellipse is always found on the right hand side and the minimum is found on the left hand side because it is symmetric and centered.\nTherefore, $\\boxed{y}$ will be the greatest if we got the $(x,y)$ coordinate to be rightmost and that can be expressed as the point where $\\boxed{(x-7)^2}$ equals $289$ (subtracting 7 from both sides) and setting it equal to $0$ multiplying by $-2$.  Then it gives us $\\boxed{2(x-7) =0}$.  Since the rightmost point is found when this equation equals $0$.\nSince $\\boxed{2(x-7) = 0}$  we know that $x=7$ and $\\boxed{y}$ must equal the value of $y$ given at the point $(7,24)$ on the ellipse.\nTherefore, $\\boxed{y}$ is equal to $\\boxed{24}$.
