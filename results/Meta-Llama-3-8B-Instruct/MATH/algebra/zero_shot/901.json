        " Step 1: Solve for y in terms of z\nWe are given that $7y=10z$. So dividing both sides by 7, we get $\\frac{7y}{7}=\\frac{10z}{7}$ which is $y=\\frac{10z}{7}$.\n### Step 2: Solve the original equation for x in terms of z\nWe are given that $2x=5y$ and we have just found that $y=\\frac{10z}{7}$. So, we can substitute this value of y into the equation to obtain $2x=5\\left(\\frac{10z}{7}\\right)$. Now multiplying the left-hand side of this equation by 1 which is equal to $\\frac{7}{7}$, we get $2x\\left(\\frac{7}{7}\\right)=5\\left(\\frac{10z}{7}\\right)\\left(\\frac{7}{7}\\right)$. Now simplifying this equation, we have $\\frac{14x}{7}=5\\left(\\frac{10z}{7}\\right)$ which is $\\frac{14x}{7}=\\frac{50z}{7}$. Now multiplying both sides of this equation by $\\frac{1}{7}$, we get $\\frac{14x}{7}\\left(\\frac{1}{7}\\right)=\\frac{50z}{7}\\left(\\frac{1}{7}\\right)$ which is $\\frac{x}{7}=\\frac{50z}{49}$. Finally, multiplying both sides of this equation by $7$, we have $x=\\frac{50z}{7}$. Now, we want to find the value of $\\frac{z}{x}$ expressed as a common fraction. So, we need to write $x$ in terms of $z$ so that we can have the value of $\\frac{z}{x}$.

Aptitude tests are designed to measure specific skills, such as memory, problem-solving, or spatial reasoning, but they may not capture other important abilities, such as creativity, communication, or emotional intelligence.\nMoreover, aptitude tests are often based on a single dimension of human performance, such as verbal or quantitative skills, which may not be the most important aspect of a particular field. For example, a test that measures spatial reasoning may be relevant for an engineering or architecture career, but it may not be as important for a career in anthropology or sociology, which may require different skills.\nAnother issue with aptitude tests is that they can be influenced by social and cultural factors, which can impact the results. For example, people from higher-income backgrounds may have better access to educational resources and opportunities, which can result in higher test scores, even if their aptitude is similar to that of people from lower-income backgrounds.\nAjomie O. does not recommend this response.",
