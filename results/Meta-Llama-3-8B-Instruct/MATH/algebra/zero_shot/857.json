        " 140.\nIf Abby and Bart weigh 160 pounds together, that means Abby weighs some amount A. If Bart and Cindy weigh 180 pounds together, that means Bart weighs some amount B, so Cindy weighs C = 180 - B, and Abby weighs A = 160 - B. If Cindy and Damon weigh 200 pounds together, that means Cindy weighs C = 200 - D, which gives us D = 180 + A - B. Abby and Damon weigh together A + D = A + 180 + A - B = 2A + 180. If we remember that A + B = 160, then A = 160 - B, so 2A + 180 = 2(160 - B) + 180 = 320 - 2B + 180 = 500 - 2B.

        " We know Abby and Bart weigh 160, Bart and Cindy weigh 180, and Cindy and Damon weigh 200. So if we think about the repeated variables, we know that B & C weighing 180 and C & D weighing 200 is like taking away 20 pounds from what they would weigh if they were put together. So B + 20 on the scale means that light people.\n### Explanation: The key is to set up a system of equations using the information given. The sum of the weights of Abby and Bart is 160, so we can set up the equation:\n### A + B = 160\nThe sum of the weights of Bart and Cindy is 180, so we can set up the equation:\n### B + C = 180\nThe sum of the weights of Cindy and Damon is 200, so we can set up the equation:\n### C + D = 200\nNow we want to find the sum of the weights of Abby and Damon. Think of the equation A + D as being equal to something that we can solve for:\n### A + D = ?\nWe know that A + B = 160 and B + C = 180, so we can rewrite the first equation as:\n### A + ( C - C + B ) = 160\nSubtract C from both sides of the equation, add C - C, and then combine like terms:\n### A + B - C = 160 - C\nAdd B to both sides of the equation:\n### A + 2B - C = 160\nSubtract 2B from both sides of the equation:\n### A - C = 160 - 2B\nNow we know that C + D = 200, so we can rewrite this equation as:\n### C = 200 - D\nReplace the C in the equation with (200 - D), and simplify:\n### A - (200 - D) = 160 - 2B\nExpand the equation and simplify:\n### A - 200 + D = 160 - 2B\nSimplify further:\n### -180 + A + D = -2B\nNow you should have a sense of where this is going. Since we want to find the sum of Abby and Damon, we can think of this as setting aside A and D as being equal to something, let\u2019s call it X:\n### A + D = X\nX is going to be equal to the sum of Abby and Damon\u2019s weights.

If we subtract the weight of Bart from the total, we get the weight of Abby.\nWeight of Abby = (Weight of Abby and Bart together) - (Weight of Bart and Cindy together) - (Weight of Cindy and Damon together) + (Weight of Cindy and Bart together)\n= 160 - 180 + 200 - (Weight of Bart and Cindy together)\nSince the weight of Abby and Bart together is 160 pounds, and Bart and Cindy weigh 180 pounds together, it means Bart weighs 20 pounds less than Cindy. So, Cindy weighs 180 - 20 = 160 pounds, and Bart weighs 20 pounds. Since Abby weighs 160 - 20 = 140 pounds.",
        " First, we know Bart and Cindy weigh 180 pounds together. Cindy and Damon weigh 200 pounds together. So Bart and Damon weigh 20 pounds together (180 + 20 = 200). Then, Abby and Bart weigh 160 pounds together, which means Abby is 40 pounds lighter than Bart (160 - 40 = 120). Abby and Damon weigh _______ pounds together. Think about it this way: we know Bart and Damon weigh 20 pounds together. If Abby is 40 pounds lighter than Bart, then Abby and Damon must include a total of 20 + 40 = 60 pounds.\nTherefore, Abby and Damon weigh 60 pounds together. Final Answer: The final answer is 60. I hope it is correct. 4645\n### Alternate ",
        " \nAbby + Bart = 160 pounds, so Abby = 160 - Bart. \n### Step 1: \nThis information gives us a relationship between Abby and Bart, which means we know Abby\u2019s weight is the difference between the two of them and 160. We can represent this with an equation: Abby = 160 - Bart.\n### Step 2: \nThen, we are given another equation: Bart + Cindy = 180 pounds. We can solve this equation for Bart: Bart = 180 - Cindy. \n### Step 3: \nNext, the third statement is Cindy + Damon = 200 pounds. We can solve this for Cindy: Cindy = 200 - Damon. \n### Step 4: \nNow we can write Abby as an expression in terms of Damon using our previously found expressions for Cindy and Bart: \nAbby = (160 - Bart) = (160 - (180 - Cindy)) = 160 - 180 + Cindy = -20 + Cindy \n### Step 5: \nWe can now express Cindy as an expression in terms of Damon: \nCindy = 200 - Damon \n### Step 6: \nSo, substituting Cindy into the expression above for Abby, we have \nAbby = -20 + Cindy = -20 + (200 - Damon) = 180 - Damon \n### Step 7: \nThe problem asks for the total weight of Abby and Damon, represented as (Abby + Damon). We can express this using the equations obtained above: \nAbby + Damon = (180 - Damon) + Damon = 180 - Damon + Damon 180 = 180 pounds\n### ",
        " The solution seems to require a little bit of wordplay, thinking algebraically, and being mindful of the available information. Let a, b, c, and d denote the individual weights of Abby, Bart, Cindy, and Damon, respectively. We know that Abby and Bart weigh together 160 pounds. This is expressed by the equation $$(a+b) \\ 160.$$ Bart and Cindy together weigh 180 pounds, so the equation becomes $$(a+c) = 180.$$ Cindy and Damon together weigh 200 pounds, so $$(c+d) = 200.$$ Now we will combine all equations into one:\n$$(a+b) + (a+c) + (c+d) = 160+180+200.$$ After we simplify this equation, we will get: $$2a+c+d= 540.$$ To solve this system of equations, we need to choose one equation and substitute the expression for c and d formulated in the previous equation. We can choose the first equation, (a+c) = 180, to substitute. Then we would get:\n$$2a + (a+c) = (2a+c) = 160+180+200=540.$$ Then 2a + c = 540 becomes a+c = 270. We now substract 2 from both sides of the equation to get a = 270, but this isn\u2019t accurate.\nThe given problem doesn\u2019t support the subtraction of 2 to get a. This actually means we have to think another way. Keeping in mind we have miscalculated earlier. I need to rethink our initial system of equations and identify the new possibilities remaining. Understanding the error in algebraic manipulation, let\u2019s now go for trial and error, remove a chart, or draw a chart the problem which contributes to solving this problem and thoroughly track it, and then give it a 1/2 of the entire problem set in short.\n### Answer 1: As we are asked for how many Abby and Damon weigh together, it is crucial to find the weight of Abby and the weight of Damon separately, then add them together to get their combined weight.\nGiven (a+b) = 160, (a+c) = 180, and (c+d) = 200.\na+b=160, a+c=180, c+d=200. Now we need to connect Abby and Damon\u2019s weight.",
        " \nLet\u2019s call Abby's weight A, Bart\u2019s weight B, Cindy's weight C, and Damon\u2019s weight D. We are given the following equations:\nA + B = 160 \u2026 (1)\nB + C = 180 \u2026 (2)\nC + D = 200 \u2026 (3)\nWe can add all three equations together to get A + B + B + C + C + D = 160 + 180 + 200 = 540. Simplify by combining terms on the left side to get A + 2B + 2C + D = 540. Since we now have only one equation with six unknowns (the four weights), we cannot get a unique solution yet.\nTo reduce the number of unknowns, we can use one more piece of information. By the problem, we know that Abby and Damon don't weigh themselves in pairs. This means that the sum of their weights cannot be equal to 160, 180, or 200. So, let\u2019s try to eliminate those possibilities.\nIf Abby and Damon weighed 160 pounds, then A + D = 160, which would mean A + (540 - A - 2B - 2C) = 160. Simplify to 2A + 2C - 2B = 80, which is impossible since the weights of the four people are in pounds.\nSimilarly, we can check if Abby and Damon weighed 180 or 200 pounds, and we find that both cases lead to impossible equations. Therefore, we know that Abby and Damon weigh a sum of pounds that is not 160, 180, or 200.\nIf the sum is n, then A + D = n. To find the value of n, we can again add the given equations together but simplify them a bit more: A + B + B + C + C + D = 540 becomes 2A + 2B + 2C + D = 540. Then subtract 2(B + C) from both sides to get A + D = 540 - 2(B + C). Since we know that B + C = 180, then A + D = 540 - 2(180) = 180. So, Abby and Damon weigh 180 pounds together.\nNote that 180 isn't one of the possibilities we eliminated earlier. That means this solution is correct!\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 180. I hope it is correct.",
        " Start by assuming the weights of the people: Write the equations:\n\\begin{align*}\nA + B &= 160 \\\\ B + C &= 180 \\\\ C + D &= 200\n\\end{align*}\nNow, try to find an equation for A + D. Since Abby and Bart weigh 160 pounds, we know that B = 160 - A. Substitute this into the equation for Bart and Cindy (B + C = 180), and we have:\n\\begin{align*}\n160 - A + C &= 180 \\\\ C &= 20 + A\n\\end{align*}\nNow, substitute this into the equation for Cindy and Damon (C + D = 200), and we have:\n\\begin{align*}\n20 + A + D &= 200 \\\\ D &= 180 - A\n\\end{align*}\nTherefore, Abby and Damon weigh:\n\\begin{align*}\nA + D &= A + (180 - A) \\\\ &= 180\n\\end{align*}\nBut wait! We assumed that the weights are freedoms. So, A and D are not necessarily fixed. Instead, we know that A + D = 180 as a constant. We can leave it like this because we are told that the weights are unspecified.\n#### 180\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 180. I hope it is correct. 180 pounds.

        " We can use properties of equations to unpack this problem.

        " \nWe have to find, let\u2019s say, the combined weight for Abby and Damon. So, let\u2019s start by representing the weights (in pounds) of Ivy, Jill, Kate, and Lee with symbols a, b, c and d.\nThen, according to the given statements, we have:\na+b = 160\nb+c = 180\nc+d = 200\nWe can do some algebra to show how these can be used to find what we want.\n\u2013 Take the first equation and multiply both sides by -1.\n\u2013 Subtraction gives: a+b = 160; -b-c = -180; a-c = -20\n\u2013 Now take the equation and multiply both sides by -1.\n\u2013 Here we go a+c = 200; -a-d = -200; c-d = -100\n\u2013 We add both results, which is also suited to note the left-hand side.\nThe results of Abby/Damon is -100, which is the equivalent of 100.\nTherefore, together Abby and Damon weigh 100 pounds, plus a total of 100 pounds. That lb pounds. Plus 100 more. We calculate that the total weight of Abby and Damon together is 100 more. Bill\u2019s weight.\nThe answer is 100 pounds. **\nSo, Abby and Damon weigh together 100 pounds. Note that we used letters a, b, c, and d for the weights of the individuals, but it would be more intuitive to use actual names if we knew what they were (if the problem had provided that information, we might have been more likely to remember the values of a, b, c, and d and figure it out faster).\nWe are given four equations:\na + b = 160\nb + c = 180\nc + d = 200\na = c - d + b\n100\nWe can write an equation for the total weight of the group:\na + b + c + d = 640\nSo, to find the total weight of Abby and Damon together, we subtract their combined weight from the total weight of the group.

Since Cindy and Bart weigh 180 and Cindy and Damon weigh 200, Bart and Damon\u2019s combined weight must be 200 - 180 = 20 pounds.\n180 = 20 + Bart\u2019s weight, so Bart weighs 180 - 20 = 160 pounds.\nStep 3: Use the information to find Cindy\u2019s weight.

Cindy and Damon weigh 200, which means their combined weight - Cindy\u2019s weight.\n200 - 90 = 110\nDamon weighs 110 pounds.\n#### Expert Answer:\nWe know that the total weight of the pair consisting of Abby and Bart is 160 pounds, the total weight of the pair consisting of Bart and Cindy is 180 pounds, and the total weight of the pair consisting of Cindy and Damon is 200 pounds. Let W(A), W(B), W(C), and W(D) be the weights of Abby, Bart, Cindy, and Damon respectively. Then we have W(A) + W(B) = 160, W(B) + W(C) = 180, W(C) + W(D) = 200, and we want to find W(A) + W(D). From the second and third equations, we get W(B) + W(C) - W(C) = W(B) - W(C) = 180 - 200 = -20, so W(B) = 80 and W(C) = 100. Now, from the first equation, W(A) + W(B) = 160, we get W(A) + 80 = 160, so W(A) = 80. Finally, W(A) + W(D) = 80 + W(D). We do not have an equation involving W(D). But we can use the third equation to eliminate W(C). Subtracting 100 from both sides gives W(D) - W(C) = 100, so W(C) + W(D) = 200, and subtracting 100 from both sides gives W(D) - 100 = 100. So W(D",

        " Let a, b, c and d be the weight of Abby, Bart, Cindy and Damon respectively. \nWe are given the following equations: \na + b = 160 \nb + c = 180 \nc + d = 200 \nThe last piece of information we need is a + d?. \nWe know that the above equations can be rearranged to: \na = 160 - b \nc = 200 - d \nNow we can solve this system of equations. \nFrom the second equation b + c = 180, we have: \nb + (200 - d) = 180 \nSimplifying this, we have: \nb + 200 - d = 180 \nb - d = 20 \nNow we know that b - d = 20. Therefore, a - d = 140* by applying the formula (a + b = 160). \n*Also, the sum of all the weights is a + b + c + d = 200 + 20 = 520. \nTherefore, the answer is equal to: 520 - (140 + 200) = 520 - 340 = 180. \n### Solution: Since a+b=160, b=a+160. Substitute it into c+b=180: c+(a+160)=180. Simplify it: c+a=20. By the same logic, b+d=20 but we know that d+200=180, thus d=40. Substitute b=a+160 into b+d=20: a+160+40=20, thus a=80. So, a+b+c+d=80+40+200=520. So, the answer is 88+40= 180.\n",
