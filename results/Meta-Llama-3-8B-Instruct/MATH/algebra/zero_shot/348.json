It follows that $P(y) = (y-y)^3 + (y-z)^3 + (z-y)^3 = 0$, so $y$ is a root of $P(x) = 0$ and $x-y$ divides into $P(x)$. By symmetry, it follows that $y-z$ and $z-x$ divide into $P(x)$. Since $P$ is a cubic in its variables, it follows that $P = k(x-y)(y-z)(z-x)$, where $k$ is a constant. By either expanding the definition of $P$, or by trying test values (if we take $x = 0, y = -1, z = 1$, we obtain $P = -6 = k \\cdot (-2)$), it follows that $k = 3$.

Well, that would mean that y and z are both nonzero. Since our expression involves all three, they must all be distinct.\nCan we find a relationship between y and z?

        " \nNote that the denominator of the first term, $$(y-z)(z-x)$$ must be positive as $x,y,z$ are distinct. Hence, $$(y-z)(z-x) \\ge 0$$and since the numerator, $$(y-x)^2$$ is always non-negative,  $$\\frac{(y-x)^2}{(y-z)(z-x)} \\ge 0.$$Similarly, we have $$\\frac{(z-y)^2}{(z-x)(x-y)} \\ge 0,$$and $$\\frac{(x-z)^2}{(x-y)(y-z)} \\ge 0.$$So the sum of the three terms is greater than or equal to 0, but it is not necessarily equal to 0. We can try to find some zeroes in order to minimize it. If we set $x=y$, then the expression becomes $$\\frac{(z-y)^2}{(z-x)(x-y)} + \\frac{(x-z)^2}{(x-y)(y-z)},$$ which simplifies to the following single term, $$\\frac{(z-y)^2}{(z-y)(y-z)} = 1.$$This clearly won\u2019t be the minimum value, so we set $x=z$. This gives $$\\frac{(z-y)^2}{(x-y)^2}+\\frac{(x-z)^2}{(z-y)^2}.$$The first term is just the reciprocal of the second term, since we have squared the denominator in the first term. Hence, the sum is the harmonic mean of the two terms, and the value of the expression will be minimized when the sum is minimized. Hence, we can take the limit for the sum approaching the minimum and we obtain, $$\\frac{2}{\\frac{1}{(z-y)^2}+\\frac{1}{(z-x)^2 }}.$$Now, $$\\frac{1}{(z-y)^2} = \\frac{y^2-2yz+y^2}{(z-y)^2}=yz\\ \\Rightarrow\\ y=\\frac{1}{z}.$$We can substitute this to our original equation and obtain, $$\\frac{2}{\\frac{1}{z^2-2z+1/z^2}+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{1}{z})^2 }}.$$ The above expression is obtained from, $$\\frac{2(z-z^2+1-\\frac{1",

Step 2: Now it\u2019s left to minimize $3(y-z)$ where $y$ and $z$ are real numbers. So, we want $\\min_{y\\in\\mathbb{R},y\\neq x\\neq z}3(y-z)$ and since the sign is important, we have to get $y-z = -\\min\\{(y-z), (y-z)\\} = -|y-z|$. So we are left with $\\max_{y\\in\\mathbb{R},y\\neq x\\neq z}|y-z|$ where $y$ any of the two minimizers $x$ or $z$ and $x$ the third one. As for the maximum one, there are two cases:\n\u2022 $y\\geq z$\n\u2022 $y< z$\nHowever step 3: we now have to try what happens when $y\\geq z$.\n\u2022 case $y\\geq z, y\\neq z$: If $y>z$ then they are more than one unit apart. This also means $z-y$ is significant. Now we have to consider $|y-z| = y-z = y - z$. We choose $y =",
        " 1. First, try to find a value of $x,y,z$ that would make the expression as small as possible.\nHmmm... Let me think for a moment.\n Ah! I see! $x = y = z$.\nThe reason why I choose this is because the expression has $\\frac{(y-x)^2}{(y-z)(z-x)}$ and another expression with $\\frac{(z-y)^2}{(z-x)(x-y)}$. When they equals zero, then they can get as close as possible to $\\frac{0}{0}$ which would make the expression as small as possible. And this is only possible when $x = y = z$.\nThis will show us that $x=y=z$. But, let\u2019s not stop there. We still need to show whether that is the smallest possible value. Maybe, we could try another set of values? Like $x = 0$, $y = 1$, and $z = 2$.\nOh, it looks like $x=y=z$ is actually the smallest possible value. But we can be sure that $x=y=z$ is the smallest possible value by showing that if $x \\neq y$ or $z \\neq x$ or if $y \\neq z$ then the value will increase or the value will still be greater than the smallest possible value.\nHow do you think this person optimized their solution?

        " \nLet\u2019s see. Set $x = a < y < z$. The function will always be positive, so we should minimize it. To do this, we want to get rid of the terms with $(y-z)$ in the denominator, because they dominate the function when $|y-z|$ is big.\nTo do this, we note that $x > y$ and $y > z$, so $(y-z)(z-x)$ must be positive, while $(z-x)(x-y)$ and $(x-y)(y-z)$ are negative. Thus, we want to make $(y-z)(z-x)$ as small as possible. If we let $z \\to y$, the denominator will approach $0$, so make the original expression approach $\\infty$. However, if we make $(x-z)$ as big as possible, then we can still get this to approach $0$. If $z \\to \\infty$, we would have the original expression approach $0$, but that\u2019s not what we want. Thus, it seems that letting $(y-z) \\to 0$ and $(x-z) \\to 0$ simultaneously will give us the lowest expression possible.\nTherefore, pick $y = z-1$ and $x = z-2$. The expression would become $$\\left(\\frac{1}{(z-z+1)(z-(z-2))}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{((z-1)-z+2)(z-(z-1))}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{(z-2-z-1)(z-2-(z-2))}\\right) = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{1}}$$",

By the same observation, the function $(x-z)^2$ attains its maximum value of 4 when $x+z=-1$ and $xz=1$. Finally, the function $(z-x)^2$ attains its maximum value of 4 when $x+z=-1$ and $xz=1$. Thus, we have $x+y+z=-3,$ $xy+xz+xz=3,$ and $xyxxyz=3.$ With $x+y+z=-3$, we find that $yz=0.$ Hence, we have $x+z=xy=1$ and $y=-1.$ Then, by Vieta\u2019s formulas for the polynomial $t^3-at^2+b$, we have $x=-1,\\ y=0,\\ z=1$.

        " \n$\\begingroup$\nStep 1: Notice that $\\frac{(y-x)^2}{(y-z)(z-x)} \\geq 0$, and similarly for the other two terms, so their sum is non-negative.\nStep 2: Notice that if $x = y$, the sum is equal to $\\frac{(z-x)^2}{(z-x)(x-z)} = \\frac{(z-x)}{(x-z)}$.  The same is true whether one swaps the order of $x$ and $y$, or $y$ and $z$.  So, the sum is minimized when $x = y = z$, which gives $\\frac{(0)^2}{0} = 0$.\nTherefore, the smallest possible value is $\\boxed{0}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 0. I hope it is correct. $\\endgroup$ $\\begingroup$ Let me be more human and go further. Step 3: The expression we are minimizing is $\\frac{(y-x)^2(y+z)+4(x-y)(z-y)(x+y)}{(y-z)(z-x)(x-y)}$.  By rearranging, we get $\\frac{(y+z)[(y-x)^2 - 4(x-y)(z-y)]}{(y-z)(z-x)(x-y)}$.  Therefore, the numerator is at most $0$, so the sum of the terms is minimized when $(y-x)^2 - 4(x-y)(z-y) = 0$.\nStep 4: Then, the numerator is $4(x-y)(y-z)$. Then, the sum of all three terms is $\\frac{(x-y)(y-z)}{(x-y)(y-z)} = 1$, not less than $0$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 0.

        " This particular algebra problem can be solved step by step through a series of algebraic manipulations.

This sum is minimised when each of the terms is minimised. To minimise each term, we set the derivative with respect to $(y-x)^2$ to zero, and repeat this process for $(z-y)^2$ and $(x-z)^2$. The derivative of the expression \\begin{align*}\n(y-x)^2(y-z) + (z-y)^2(z-x) + (x-z)^2(x-y)\n\\end{align*}with respect to $(y-x)^2$ is \\begin{align*}\n(y-z) + 2(y-x)^2\\frac{\\partial(y-z)}{\\partial (y-x)^2} + 0 + 0\n\\end{align*}where we have used the fact that the derivative of $(y-x)^2$ is $2(y-x)$.
