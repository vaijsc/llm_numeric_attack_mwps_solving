I hope it is correct. ##### This is a basic property of logarithms: \\log_b (a^r) = \\frac{r}{\\log_b a}. In this problem, we have \\log_{5^2}5^4. Let's use the basic property and plug in 5^2 for b and 5^4 for a to get: \\frac{4}{\\log_{5^2}5^2}. Next, we can use the property of logarithms again, but this time with the base switched: \\log_a b = \\frac{1}{\\log_b a}. Plugging in 5^2 for a and 5 for b, we get: \\log_{5^2}5 = \\frac{1}{\\log_55^2}. Using the fact that \\log_b b^s = s, we can simplify this expression to 1/\\log_55 = 1/1 = 1. Plugging this back in, we get: \\frac{4}{\\log_{5^2}5^2} = \\frac{4}{1} = \\boxed{4}. Therefore, \\log_{5^2}5^4 = \\boxed{4}. This answer is not 2, as indicated in the response.

        " Recall that the base of a logarithm is the number where we divide 1, power is the number of times we must multiply 1 by that number to get the input value and ascertain input value.
