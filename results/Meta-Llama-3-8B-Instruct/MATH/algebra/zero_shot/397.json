We are looking for the intersection points. So, we use the quadratic formulas to get $x$ in terms of $y$, then substitute the value into the other equation, and solve for $y$.

We have that $a=1$ and $a=2$, so the parabola $y=-x^2-x+1$ opens downward, and the parabola $y=2x^2-1$ opens upward. This means that the only way these parabolas can intersect is at a local maximum and a local minimum, and that these two intersections must lie on the same vertical line, or $x$-value. The vertex of a parabola $y=ax^2+bx+c$ occurs when the derivative $y'=2ax+b$ equals",
        "\u00a0First Let\u2019s solve the equations. To do this, we can rewrite the first equation in standard form $y=ax^2+bx+c.$ We find that $$\\begin{split}y&=-x^2-x+1\\\\ &=-x^2-x+1+0x^0\\\\ &=-x^2-x+1.\\end{split}$$We can write it this way because all quadratic polynomials with no additive constant can have their $x^0$ terms as $0x^0$, and still, i be in standard form. Now we compare constant terms, to see that $c=1$ and to compare $x$ terms to see that $b=-1$ and compare $x^2$ terms to see that $a=-1$.\nNow we move onto the second equation in standard form. We find that $$\\begin{split}y&=2x^2-1\\\\ &=2x^2+0x+(-1)\\\\ &=2x^2.\\end{split}$$Using this, our table so far is\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\na&b&c\\\\\\hline\n-1&-1&1\\\\\\hline\n2&0&-1\\\\\\hline\n\\end{array}\n### We see that we can now equate the two and solve for x: $$\\begin{split} -x^2-x+1=2x^2-1\\\\ -x^2-x+1+1=2x^2-1+1\\\\ -x^2-x+2=2x^2-0\\\\ 0=3x^2+x-2 \\end{split}$$\nThis quadratic equation equals $0$ only when it is equal to zero. So letting it be equal to zero at points $(x)$ we have that $$\\begin{split}0&=3x^2+x-2\\\\ &=(3x+1)(x-2)\\\\ &=(x+1)(3x-2)\\\\ &=(x+1)(2x-x-2)\\\\ &=(x+1)(2x-2).\\end{split}$$Now solve for $x$.\nIt is well known we can solve linear parts of quadratic equations easily and it\u2019s easier to factor out unequal terms in the parabola so that the other side is linear. By doing so",

        "  To solve this problem, we will need to find the $x$-coordinates $a$ and $c$ of the points of intersection, and then find the difference between the coordinates.\nTo solve this problem, we will need to find the $x$-coordinates $a$ and $c$ of the points of intersection, and then find the difference between the coordinates.\nBy equating the right-hand sides of the two equations, we get the following equation:\n\\begin{align*}\n-y &= 2x^2-1 - (-x^2-x+1)\\\\\n&= 2x^2-x^2-x+2\\\\\n&= x^2-x+2\\\\\n&= 0\n\\end{align*}Thus, we have $x^2-x+2=0$, so\n\\begin{align*}\nx &= \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1^2-4(1)(2)}}{2(1)}\\\\\n&= \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{-7}}{2}\\\\\n&= \\frac{1 \\pm i\\sqrt{7}}{2}.\n\\end{align*}Since these are the $x$-coordinates of the points $(a,b)$ and $(c,d)$ of intersection, and we are given that $c\\ge a$, it must be the case that $c=\\frac{1+i\\sqrt{7}}{2}$ and $a=\\frac{1-i\\sqrt{7}}{2}$.Now, we can use the given equations to calculate the corresponding $y$-coordinates: for $(a,b)=\\left(\\frac{1-i\\sqrt{7}}{2},\\frac{-4-i\\sqrt{7}}{4}\\right)$, we have $b=\\frac{-4-i\\sqrt{7}}{4}$; for $(c,d)=\\left(\\frac{1+i\\sqrt{7}}{2},\\frac{-5+2i\\sqrt{7}}{4}\\right)$, we have $d=\\frac{-5+2i\\sqrt{7}}{4}$.Thus, we can now calculate the difference between the coordinates:$$c-a = \\frac{1+i\\sqrt{7}}{2} - \\frac{1-i\\sqrt{7}}{2} = \\boxed{\\frac{2i\\sqrt{7}}{2} = i\\"
