So, one solution is $(x,y)=(10,5)$. The other solutions are reflections of $(10,5)$ across the vertical axis, and the circle passes through the center (5,15), so $(x,y)=(-10,5)$ is another solution. Finally, since $x=2y$, $(x,y)=(x,2x)$ is a point on the circle too. Plugging in the known point $(10,5)$ and using the center-radius equation, we find that$$(x-5)^2+(2x-15)^2=130.$$This simplifies to$$x^2-10x+25+(4x^2-60x+225)=130\\Rightarrow5x^2-70x+110=0.$$Factoring the quadratic polynomial, we find that$$(5x-22)(x-5)=0\\Rightarrow x=22/5\\approx4.4$or$x=5$.$$x$ cannot equal$0$, since it implies that$x=2y=0$, which means that the coordinates are both$0$, which is not true given the question.

The circle is centered at $(5,15)$ and has a radius of $\\sqrt{130}$ units. Point $Q = (x,y)$ is on the circle, has integer coordinates, and the value of the $x$-coordinate is twice the value of the $y$-coordinate.\nThe first step is to find the equation of the circle in the form $(x-h)^2+(y-k)^2=r^2$, where $(h,k)$ is the center of the circle and $r$ is the radius. We are given that the center is at $(5,15)$, so we can plug this into the equation:\n$$(x-5)^2+(y-15)^2=r^2$$\nWe are also given that the radius is $\\sqrt{130}$, so we can plug this in as well:\n$$(x-5)^2+(y-15)^2=130$$\nNow we can combine the four factors of $(x-5)^2$ to form a single quadratic expression:\n$$x^2-10x+25+y^2-30y+225=130$$\nCombine like terms to get a simpler equation:\n$$x^2-10x+y^2-30y=70$$\nThe next step is to use the fact that the value of the $x$-coordinate is twice the value of the $y$-coordinate, which means we can express $y$ in terms of $x$:\n$$x^2-10x+(2x)^2-30(2x)=70$$\nCombine like terms and simplify:\n$$x^2-10x+4x^2-60x=70$$\nCombine like terms and simplify:\n$$5x^2-70x+70=0$$\nFactor the quadratic expression:\n$$(5x-14)(x-5)=0$$\nThis gives us two possible values for $x$: $x=\\frac{14}{5}$ or $x=5$.

Going back to the circle equation, we see that if we write the $x$-value in terms of the $y$-value, we get $\\boxed{x=2y}.$ \nTaking this into account:\n1. $5x-24=0$, which means $x=24/5$, but since $x=2y$ and $y$ is undefined, this does not satisfy our condition of having integer coordinates.\n2. $x-8=0$, which means $x=8$, which actually works!

Therefore, the $x$ value that makes the equation work out is the one that makes either one of these products equal to zero. Note: The quadratic equation of the circle can be written as: $(x-5",
        " 29\nBecause the circle is centered at (5,15) and has a radius of $\\sqrt{130}$ units, we know that the equation of the circle is given by $(x-5)^2 + (y-15)^2 = 130$. Then, we can see that the point Q is on the circle so we can substitute the given information to the equation. $x=2y$ so we have:\n\\begin{align*} (x-5)^2 + (y-15)^2 &= 130 \\\\\n(2y-5)^2 + (y-15)^2 &= 130 \\\\\n4y^2 - 20y + 25 + y^2 - 30y + 225 &= 130 \\\\\n5y^2 - 50y + 250 &= 130 \\\\\n5y^2 - 50y + 120 &= 0 \\\\\n5(y^2 - 10y + 24) &= 0 \\\\\n5(y - 6)(y - 4) &= 0 \\\\\ny &= 4, 6\n\\end{align*}\nWith $y=4$, $x=8$ and with $y=6$, $x=12$. Because we need the maximum possible value, we choose $x=12$, so the maximum possible value is $\\boxed{12}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 12. I hope it is correct. ### ",
        "1\nLet's call the center of the circle $(a, b)$. Since the center is $(5, 15)$, $a = 5$ and $b = 15$.

        "  $$\\left( x - 5 \\right)^2 + {y^2} = \\left( {\\sqrt {130} } \\right)^2.$$ Since $y$ is twice the value of $x$, we can say $y = 2x$. We then substitute $y = 2x$ into the above equation. $$\\left( {x - 5} \\right)^2 + \\left( {2x} \\right)^2 = \\left( {\\sqrt {130} } \\right)^2$$ Simplify it first: $$\\left( {x - 5} \\right)^2 + 4{x^2} = \\left( {\\sqrt {130} } \\right)^2$$ Now distribute $$x^2 - 10x + 25 + 4{x^2} = \\left( {\\sqrt {130} } \\right)^2$$ Simplify it further: $$5{x^2} - 10x + 25 = \\left( {\\sqrt {130} } \\right)^2$$ Now we are going to complete the square: $$5\\left( {{x^2} - 2x + 1} \\right) + 20 = \\left( {\\sqrt {130} } \\right)^2$$ $$5\\left( {x - 1} \\right)^2 + 20 = \\left( {\\sqrt {130} } \\right)^2$$ Since the right-hand side is positive, to make the left-hand side positive too, we need the left-hand side positive.

        " First, we can write the equation of a circle using the standard form\n#### (x-h)^2+(y-k)^2=r^2\n#### Because we are given a circle centered at (5,15) with a radius of \\sqrt{130}, we can fill in the values for (h,k) and r.\nWe need to calculate (x-h)^2 and (y-k)^2, and then add those two terms, set equal to r^2, and solve for x and y. But before we do that, let\u2019s manipulate the given information: x is equal to 2y. So if we plug in that information into the circle equation, we have\n#### (x-5)^2+(y-15)^2=(\\sqrt{130})^2\n#### 4y^2-20y+100+y^2-30y+225=130\n#### 5y^2-50y+275=130\n#### 5y^2-50y+145=0\n#### (y-1)(5y-29)=0\n#### So y=1 or y=29/5. We are given that y is an integer, so y must be 1.\n#### If y=1, then x=2y, so x=2.\n#### If y=29/5, then x would not be equal to an integer. If y were an integer, then y would not satisfy the equation of the circle.\n#### In any case, the maximum value of x is \\boxed{2}.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2. I hope it is correct.\nLet\u2019s calculate (x-h)^2 and (y-k)^2, and then add those two terms, set equal to r^2, and solve for x and y. \\begin{align*}\n(x-5)^2+(y-15)^2&=(\\sqrt{130})^2 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x^2-10x+25+y^2-30y+225 &=130\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x^2-10x+y^2-30y &= -20\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x^2-10x+25+y^2-30y+9 &= -20+25+9 = 14\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad (x-5)^2+(y-15+3)^2 &= 14\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad (x-",
        " \nThe $x$-coordinate of $Q$ is twice the $y$-coordinate, so $x = 2y.$ Since we are looking for the maximum possible value of $x$, we will look at $y$ with the largest value. The largest possible integer value for $y$ is $9,$ which gives $x = 18.$\nOn the other hand, if the distance between the center of the circle and the point $Q$ is $r$, we have\n\\begin{align*}\n(5-x)^2 + (15-y)^2 &= 130\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad x &= 2y\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad (5-2y)^2 + (15-y)^2 &= 130\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad 25 - 20 y + 4y^2 + 225 - 30y + y^2 &= 130\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad 10y^2-50y+60 &= 0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad 5y^2 - 25y + 30 &= 0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad (5y-10)(y-3) &= 0.\n\\end{align*}\nThis implies that the possible integer values of $y$ are $\\boxed{3 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 9.}$ The corresponding values of $x$ are $\\boxed{6 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 18.}$ Thus the maximum possible value of $x$ is $\\boxed{18}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 18. I hope it is correct.  \\end{document} Please note that my solution is alternatively documented with blue arrows [ ].\nLet $x$ be the $x$-coordinate of point $Q.$ Since the point $Q$ has integer coordinates, $x$ must be an integer. Since the $x$-coordinate is twice the $y$-coordinate, we can write $x = 2y.$ Therefore, the equation for the circle with center at $(5,15)$ and radius $\\sqrt{130}$ can be written as follows:\n\\begin{align*}\n(5-2y)^2 + (15-y)^2 &= 130\n\\end{align*}\nto determine point $Q$. This implies that $y = 9.$ Therefore, the maximum possible value of $x$ is $\\boxed{"
