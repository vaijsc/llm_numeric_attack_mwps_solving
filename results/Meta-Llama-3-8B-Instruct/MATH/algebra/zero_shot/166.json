        " Substituting x=1 into f(x), we see that f(1) = 2^1 = 2. Likewise, f(2) = 2^2 = 4. Proceeding in this manner, we see that f(f(f(f(1)))) = f(2^4) = 2^(2^4). To find the square root of this value, we could have taken the square root of both sides, giving $(2^4)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = (2^8)^{\\frac{1}{2}}$, which is 2^4 or 16.\nHere is a table of all the values:\n| x | f(x) |\n|-   |-  |\n| 1 | 2  |\n| 2 | 4  |\n| 4 | 16 |\n| 16 | 65536 |\nWe see that f(1) = 2. f(f(1)) = f(2) = 4. f(f(f(1))) = f(4) = 16. And then f(f(f(f(1)))) = f(16) = 65536.\nThe square root is 65536^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 256.",

Can anyone explain why 256? Thank you.\nAn explanation for this solution is that $\\sqrt{f(f(f(f(1))))) = 256$ because $2^{16} = 65,536$ (by the rules of exponents), and $\\sqrt{65,536} = \\sqrt{(2^{16})} = 2^8 = 256$ (by the rules of radicals).\nThis means that if we plug all the function $f(x) = 2^x$ together, we get:\n$$f(1) = 2,$$$f(f(1)) = 2^2 = 4,$$f(f(f(1))) = 2^4 = 16,$$f(f(f(f(1)))) = 2^16 = 65,536$$.

To find the value of $f(x)$, we need to find the value of $2^x$.\nLet's start by evaluating $f(1)$.
