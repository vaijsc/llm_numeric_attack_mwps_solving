Since a 1 inch cube has surface area 6 $\\text{in}^2$ and volume 1 $\\text{in}^3$ its total price will be $6x+y$ dollars.

The volume of the 1 inch cube is $V_1=a^3=1^3=1$ cubic inches, therefore the cost of the concrete of the 1 inch cube is $C_1=cV_1=1.30$, where $c$ is the cost per 1 cubic inch.\nSimilarly, the volume of the 2 inch cube is $V_2=a^3=2^3=8$ cubic inches, so the cost of the concrete of the 2 inch cube is $C_2=cV_2=8c$.\nWe have \\begin{align*}\nC_1&=1.30,\\\\\nC_2&=8c,\\\\\n\\end{align*}which gives \\begin{align*}\nc&=\\frac{1.30}{8}=0.1625,\\\\\n\\end{align*}because we want to solve for $c$.

So the cost of a cube is 1.3 + 2pi*t different where 1.3 is for the concrete and 2\u22c5pi\u22c5t is for the coating. So we have 1.3 + 2\u22c5pi\u22c5t = 6.8 So t = 0.9/t so t = 1.6/2.45 = 0.65 So for 3 inch cube the cost is 1.3 + 2 pi * t So the final result is 7.65.### Solution2: A $1.30 cost for a 1 inch cube means that the cost per unit of volume is$\\$0.65/\\text{inch}^3$. A $6.80 cost for a 2 inch cube thus means that the cost per unit of volume is$12/\\text{inch}^3$which is also equal to 6 times the cost per unit of volume of the 1 inch cube.

        " Let\u2019s consider how much each dimension of the cube costs.  The cost per unit for cement increases by $\\$0.30$for each $\\$1.00$of growth in length (or volume), so for every $\\$1.00$of increase in volume, the cost goes up by $\\$0.30$.  The surface area of a cube grows as the length of one dimension squared (for example, the cost per unit for paint goes up by$\\$0.20$ for every $\\$0.10$ of increase in length squared).  Therefore, for every $\\$0.01$ increase in surface area, the cost goes up by$\\$0.20$, so for every $\\$1.00$ increase in surface area, the cost goes up by$\\$1.00$.  To clarify, a scale factor of 2 multiplies the cost of paint by$\\$0.20$ and multiplies the cost of cement by $\\$1.30$or$\\$1.04$. Therefore, if we double the volume by going from a$\\$1.00$ cube to a $\\$2.00$cube, the cost of cement increases to$\\$2.60$; if we double the surface area by going from a$\\$1.00$ cube to a $\\$1.41$cubic square, the cost of gold paint increases to$\\$0.84$.

        " It follows that a 2 inch cube has a volume of 8 (2\u00b3=8) and a 1 inch cube has a volume of 1, so the cost of concrete per unit volume is $$\\frac{\\1.30}{1} = \\1.30\\$$ per unit volume. Similarly, we can see that a 3 inch cube has a volume of 27 and that the cost of concrete for such a cube is $$\\1.30\\cdot 27 = 35.10\\.$$ Let\u2019s calculate the surface area of each of the cubes.  The formula is that a cube of side length $n$ has a surface area of $6n^2$. Applying this to our cubes, the 1 inch cube has a surface area of $6(1)^2 = 6$, the 2 inch cube has a surface area of $6(2)^2 = 24$, and the 3 inch cube has a surface area of $6(3)^2 = 54$. The cost of gold paint for the 1 inch cube is $\\dfrac{6}{1}\\$1.30 = \\$7.80$, and the cost of gold paint for the 2 inch cube is $\\dfrac{24}{8}\\$6.80 = \\$20.80$.

        " The cost of a 2-inch cube is $\\$6.80,$ which is$\\$8.60 - \\$1.30 = \\$7.30$ more than the cost of a 1-inch cube. Since the volume of the 2-inch cube is $2^3 = 8$ times the volume of the 1-inch cube, and the cost difference is $\\$7.30 / 8 = \\$0.91.5$ per unit volume, we conclude that the cost of the concrete is$\\$0.91.5$ per unit volume. Similarly, we can find the cost per unit surface area of the gold paint. Let $C_1$ be the cost of the 1-inch cube, $C_2$ be the cost of the 2-inch cube, $v_1$ be its volume, and $A_1$ be its surface area. By similar reasoning, we have $C_1 = 1.30 = v_1 \\cdot 0.91.5 + A_1 \\cdot 0.50$ where $0.50$ is the cost per unit surface area. We can simplify this equation to $$0.4155 = A_1.$$ Next we consider the 2-inch cube with cost $C_2 = 6.80$, volume$v_2 = 2^3 \\cdot v_1 = 8 \\cdot v_1$, and surface area $A_2$. By similar reasoning, we have $$C_2 = 6.80 = v_2 \\cdot 0.91.5 + A_2 \\cdot 0.50 = 8v_1 \\cdot 0.91.5 + A_2 \\cdot 0.50,$$  which simplifies to $$0.91.5 A_2 = 0.8355.$$Now that we have the relationship between the two surface areas, we can easily calculate the surface area of the 3-inch cube, say $A_3$, using similar reasoning. $$0.50 \\cdot A_3 = 3^2 \\cdot A_1 = 9 \\cdot 0.4155 = 3.7475.$$ Therefore, the cost of the 3-inch cube is $$\\boxed{\\$3.7475/0.50 = \\$7.49}.$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 7.49.

Therefore, the cost of the 1 inch cube is 1^(3) * k = 1.30, and the cost of the 2 inch cube is 2^(3) * k = 6.80. We can solve for k by dividing both sides by the volume of the 3 inch cube: We can solve for k by dividing both sides by the volume of the 3 inch cube: Dividing both sides by 3^3, we get:  Now, the cost of the 3 inch cube will be 3^3 * k, which is 27 * 1.30 = 35.70. The answer is$\\$35.70.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 35.70. I hope it is correct.  You can Sponsor this answer for 3.00.  Kendra Xu, Sep 14, 2021 at 05:02 Thank you for visiting our site.

        " Let\u2019s denote the cost of the paint by$P$and the cost of the concrete by$C$.  According to the problem, we have: $$C_1=\\$1.30$$and$$C_2=\\$6.80,$$where$C_1$and$C_2$are the costs of the 1 inch and 2 inch cubes respectively.  Their costs are proportional to their volumes which are given by$V_1$and$V_2$.  Therefore, we can write: $$\\frac{C_1}{V_1}=\\frac{C_2}{V_2}.$$  Substituting the values we have, we get: $$\\frac{\\$1.30}{1^3}=\\frac{\\$6.80}{2^3}.$$  This simplifies to: $$1.30=5.60.$$  Therefore, we can multiply both sides by$\\frac{1}{1.30}$to find that the cost of the concrete is$\\$1.00$ per cubic inch.  Let\u2019s denote the cost of the 3 inch cube by $C_3$.  Its cost is proportional to its volume, which is $V_3=3^3$.  Therefore, we have: $$C_3=C_1\\cdot V_3=(\\$1.00)(3^3)=\\$27.00.$$  The cost of paint for the 3 inch cube is proportional to its surface area which is equal to 6 times the area of a single face of the cube.  Therefore, the cost of paint is 6 times the area of a single face, which is equal to $6\\cdot (3^2)=18$.  Therefore, the total cost of the 3 inch cube is equal to $\\$27.00+\\$18.00=\\boxed{\\$45.00}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is$45.00.

        " We will begin by determining the cost per unit of volume of the concrete.$\\frac{6.80}{(2)^3}=\\frac{1.30}{(1)^3} \\Rightarrow 6.80 \\times \\frac{1}{8}=1.30 \\Rightarrow \\frac{12.8}{8}=1.3 \\Rightarrow 1.60$\nSo the cost of the concrete is $\\$1.60$ per unit of volume.  Therefore, one of the$3^3 = 27$unit volumes has a cost of$\\$1.60\\cdot27=\\$43.20$.  The cost per unit of surface area can be determined from$\\frac{6.80}{(2)^2}=\\frac{1.30}{(1)^2}\\Rightarrow 6.80\\times \\frac{1}{4}=1.30\\times \\frac{1}{1}\\Rightarrow \\frac{17}{4}=1.3\\times 1.3=1.69\\Rightarrow 4.25$.

The cost of the paint is proportional to the surface area, so the cost per unit of surface area needs to be determined. 2. For the 1 inch cube, the cost is $\\$1.30$.  So the cost per unit of surface area can be determined by dividing $\\$1.30$ by the surface area of the 1 inch cube.$\\frac{1.30}{(1)^2}=1.30$ 3. For the 2 inch cube, the cost is$\\$6.80$.  So the cost per unit of surface area can be determined by dividing $\\$6.80$ by the surface area",
        " We can represent the volume of the 1 inch cube as $$V_{1}=1^3,$$ and the volume of the 2 inch cube as $$V_{2}=2^3,$$ and the volume of the 3 inch cube as $$V_{3}=3^3.$$ The cost of the 1 inch cube is $\\$1.30,$ so the cost per unit volume is $$r_{1}=\\frac{\\$1.30}{V_{1}}=\\frac{\\$1.30}{1^3}=\\$1.30\\ per\\ unit^3$.$$ The cost of the 2 inch cube is $\\$6.80,$ so the cost per unit volume is $$r_{2}=\\frac{\\$6.80}{V_{2}}=\\frac{\\$6.80}{2^3}=\\$0.34\\ per\\ unit^3\\ .$$ Since the cost per unit volume of the paint is the same for both cubes, we can conclude that the cost per unit surface area is also the same, so$$r=\\$0.34.$$ The surface area of the 1 inch cube is $$S_{1}=6,$$ the surface area of the 2 inch cube is $$S_{2}=24,$$ and the surface area of the 3 inch cube is $$S_{3}=54.$$ The cost of the 1 inch cube is $\\$1.30$, and the cost of the paint on the 1 inch cube is $$c_{1}=r\\cdot S_{1}=\\$0.34 \\cdot 6 =\\$.0204.$$ The cost of the 2 inch cube is $\\$6.80$, and the cost of the paint on the 2 inch cube is $$c_{2}=r\\cdot S_{2}=\\$0.34 \\cdot 24 =\\$.0816.$$ Therefore, the cost per unit surface area is $$r=\\frac{c_{2}}{S_{2}}=\\frac{\\$.0816}{24}=\\$.0034.$$ The cost of the 3 inch cube is $\\$.20t$, and the cost of the paint on the 3 inch cube is $$c_{3}=r\\cdot S_{3}=\\$0.0034\\cdot54=\\$0.1832.$$ Therefore, the cost of the 3 inch cube is $\\$1.30+\\$0.1832=\\boxed{\\$",

Then the area of the unit cube would be $n^2$. Thus the cost of paint would be $C_p = k_1 n^2$ for some constant $k_1$.\nSimilarly, since the cost of the concrete is proportional to its volume, we have that the volume of an $n$-unit cube is $n^3$. Thus the cost of concrete would be $C_c = k_2 n^3$ for some constant $k_2$.\nNext we know that the prices of the $1$ inch cube and $2$ inch cube are given as $\\$1.30$and$\\$6.80$ respectively. Thus we can set $\\displaystyle{C_11^2 = 1.30}$ and $\\displaystyle{C_21^2 = 6.80}$.

The cost of the paint would be $C_p = 0.43366(3)^2 = 4.09598$ and the cost of concrete would be $C_c = 1.32267(3)^3 = 38.43983$. Thus, we have that the total cost is $\\boxed{\\$42.53581}$.

If we call the cost of the 2 inch cube $c$, then it follows that\n$$c=6.80=4p_0+v_0(8),$$where $p_0$ is the cost per area unit of gold paint and $v_0$ is the cost per volume unit of concrete.  Solving for $c$, we obtain\n$$c=6.80=4(0.217)+8(1.30)=1.756+10.48=12.236\\approx 6.80.$$ Therefore, the cost of the 2 inch cube is $\\$6.80$. Now, we can use the cost per area unit of gold paint and the cost per volume unit of concrete to find the ratio of the surface area of the 3 inch cube to that of the 2 inch cube:$$\\frac{6(3^2)}{6(2^2)}=\\frac{36}{24",

Let\u2019s represent the cost of the paint for each cube as the fraction of the total cost, and denote it by $p$.\nWe are also told that the cost of the concrete (which is proportional to the volume) is the same proportion of the total cost for a smaller cube as it is for a larger cube.  Let\u2019s represent the cost of the concrete as the fraction of the total cost, and denote it by $c$.\nThe total cost of a smaller cube is made up of the cost of the paint and the cost of the concrete:\n$Total\\ Cost\\ of\\ a\\ smaller\\ cube=p\\cdot\\frac{}{}+c\\cdot{}$\nWe can write this equation as $p\\cdot S_{\\text{smaller}}+c\\cdot V_{\\text{smaller}}$ where $S_{\\text{smaller}}$ is the surface area of the smaller cube and $V_{\\text{smaller}}$ is its volume.\nSimilarly, we can write the total cost of a larger cube as\n$Total\\ Cost\\ of\\ a\\ larger\\ cube=p\\cdot\\frac{}{}+c\\cdot{}$\nwhich equals $p\\cdot S_{\\text{larger}}+c\\cdot V_{\\text{larger}}$ where $S_{\\text{larger}}$ is the surface area of the larger cube and $V_{\\text{larger}}$ is its volume.\nWe know that the cost of the paint and the cost of the concrete for each cube are proportional to their respective quantities.

More questions: For example, to compute the cost of a 3 inch cube: Use the first two sets of data to estimate the rate at which the cost grows with surface area, and then use that estimated rate to determine the cost of a 3 inch cube. Final Answer: The final answer is 8.08. I hope it is correct. More questions: Given the same specifications as before, however, the actual cost of a 3 inch cube is$10.39.  The actual cost is higher since the volume of the cube is greater, and hence the cost of the concrete increases at a faster rate than the cost of the paint (surface area is only directly proportional to side length, while volume is directly proportional to side length cubed). Final Answer: The final answer is 10.39. I hope it is correct. That is because the concrete cube is cheaper and therefore the gold bricks are cheaper. Let\u2019s consider the dimension that we desire for the concrete cubes. ### Arrangement of the first lights  In this situation, it is more reasonable to consider the cost of the concrete cube rather than the paint that covers it.
