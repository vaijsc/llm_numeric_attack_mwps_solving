We can represent the information given in the problem with the following system of linear equations:\n\\begin{align*}\na+b+c+d &= 15 \\\\\n2(a+b) &= c+d \\\\\nc-8 &= d\n\\end{align*} Substituting for $c+d$ in terms of $a+b$ into the first equation gives $3a + 3b = 15$, or $a + b = 5$. This means that $c + d = 10$. The third equation can also be expressed as $c - d = 8$. Adding these two equations gives $2c = 18$, so $c = 9$. Because $d = c - 8$, $d = \\boxed{1}$.",

We can use either one to find the value of L. \nLet\u2019s use the equation L = C + V - 4: \nL = 5 (because 15 / 3 = 5). \nThe answer is 5.

        " There are 15 candies in total.\nLet's think step by step. Suppose that we have x candies of each type. Therefore, we have 4 x candies in total. The difference that the peppermint and lemon are 8 more than the lemon and peppermint are both equal.\nWe have 4 x candies. (P + L) Which is twice the number of chocolate (C) and vanilla (V?) candies. We have 2 (C + V) ------------ (1)\nExpress the difference between the number of peppermint and lemon candies as -8. We have P - L = - 8 ------------ (2)\nTherefore, the sum of the number of peppermint and lemon candies is the same as the difference between the number of peppermint and lemon candies. We have P + L = -8 + P ------------ (3)\nWe have 2 (C + V) = P + L ------------ (1)\nTherefore, we have 2 (C + V) = -8 + P ------------ (4)\nNow, substitute the (4) equation in equation (3):\n2 (C + V) = -8 + P\n2 (C + V) = P + L\nLHS (2 C) = RHS (P), C = P/2\n---------- (5)\nAnd then we can simplify and solve equation (5).

We find that a = 0. Hence, we have p + l = 2 * v\nSubstituting this expression of p into the equation l + p = 2a + 2v, we get l + l + 8 = 2 * v\nSubtracting l from both sides, we get 8 + l = 2v\nSubstituting l for 8, we get l - 8 = 2v - l \nAdding l to both sides, we get l = v + 8\nHence, the number of lemon candies is l = v + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15. \nTherefore, the number of lemon candies is 15. \nHowever, looking at the problem, we only need to find the initial number of lemon candies.

        " Let c, v, p, and l be the number of chocolate, vanilla, peppermint, and lemon candies, respectively. Since there are 15 candies in total, we can write an equation c + v + p + l = 15. Now, notice that the number of peppermint and lemon candies together (p + l) is twice the number of chocolate and vanilla candies together (c + v). We can write this as a second equation: p + l = 2(c + v). From the second equation, p + l = 2c + 2v, so c + v = (p + l)/2. Finally, there are eight more peppermint candies than lemon candies, which gives us the equation: p = l + 8. We can solve the system of equations with three variables using substitution. Let\u2019s use the last equation to solve for p, so p = l + 8, and c + v = (p + l)/2, so c + v = (l + 8 + l) / 2.

For example, we can substitute c + v + p + l = 15 into p + l = 2c + 2v, like this:\np + l = 2(c + v) = 2(c + v + p + l - p) = 2(c + v + l - p)\n= 2(c + v + 8 - p)\n= 2(c - p + v + l)\nBut we need to use p + l = 2(c + v) + some other way to express c + v + l so we can determine c + v alone. So, we have:\np + l = 2(c - p + v + l)\n= 2c + 2(v) - 2p + 2l\nWe can compare this expression to c + v + p + l = 15 to determine what number would equal 2c + 2(v) - 2p + 2l.

        " Let L denote the number of lemon candies, P denote the number of peppermint candies, C denote the number of chocolate candies, and V denote the number of vanilla candies. We have\n\\begin{align*}\nL+P+C+V&=15, \\tag1\\\\\nL+P&=C+V, \\tag2\\\\\nP-L&=8. \\tag3\n\\end{align*}Substituting equation (3) into equation (2), we have \\begin{align*}\nP+L&=C+V\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad(P+L)-(P-L)&=C+V-8\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 2P&=C+V-8.\n\\end{align*}Substituting this into equation (1), we obtain \\begin{align*}\nL+P+C+V&=15\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad L+P+(2P-8)+V&=15\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 3P+V&=23.\n\\end{align*}Substituting equation (2) into this one, we have \\begin{align*}\n3P+V&=23\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 3(P+(P-L))+L&=23\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 4P&=23+L\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad L-4P&=-23.\n\\end{align*}Substituting equation (3) into this, we obtain \\begin{align*}\nL-4(P-P+8)&=-23\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad L-4(-8)&=-23\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad L+32&=-23\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad L&=\\boxed{-55}.\n\\end{align*}Note that this is incorrect since the question doesn\u2019t specify that the candies are negative or can be negative, so we must find the correct answer from the system of equations.\nLooking at the system, notice that $-L\\le 0$ so the number of lemon candies must be a non-negative integer. Note that $L$ is positive so we can multiply the last equation we obtained by $-1$ to get $L-(-32)=23.$ Substituting this into the equation $P-L=C+V$ gives us $P+32=C+V\\Rightarrow P+21=2+V.$ We",
        " \n15 candies in total.\nNumber of peppermint and lemon candies together is twice the number of chocolate and vanilla candies together.\nCall the number of chocolate and vanilla candies $x$\nThen, number of peppermint and lemon candies together is $2x$\nSince number of peppermint and lemon candies together is $2x$ and lemon candies are $8$ more than peppermint candies, then number of peppermint candies is $x$ and number of lemon candies is $x+8$\nThus, equation for total candies is x + x + (x) + (x+8) = 15\n$4x + 8 = 15$\nNow, subtract 8 from both sides\n$4x = 7$\nNow, divide both sides by 4\n$x = 1.75$\nSince we can't have a fraction of candies, then $x$ is the number of chocolate and vanilla candies. Then, number of peppermint candies is $x = 1.75$ and number of lemon candies is $x+8 = 1.75+8 = 9.75$. However, we can't have a fraction of candies. There can only be a whole number of candies. Therefore, we round this number up. So, number of lemon candies becomes $9$.\nSo, there are 9 lemon candies.\n#### Please identify the option that best represents the response:\nB. There are 9 lemon candies.",
        " Call the number of chocolate candies x. Call the number of vanilla candies y. The number of peppermint candies will be x + 8. So, y + x is half of (x + 8) + (x + 8) = 2x + 16. So, y + x = 2x + 16/2 = x + 8. Since y + x = x + 8, y = 8. So, there are 8 vanilla candies. There are 15 total candies, so x + y + x + 8 + x = 15. Or, 2x + 8 + x = 15. We can subtract 8 and add 1 to both sides to get 3x = 8. Then we can divide by 3 to get x = 8/3 = 2 with a remainder of 2. So, there are 2 chocolate candies and 0 remainder, which means there are 2 chocolate candies, and there is 1 remaining peppermint. However, we needed one peppermint for our 8 peppermint minus 1 pepermint. Then, we can decide how many lemon candies there are. We have 1 peppermint left, and we need 8 peppermint, so the difference is 7 less peppermint than lemon. Since the number of peppermint and lemon candies together is equal to 2x + 16, and 7 less peppermint than lemon, there are 2x + 16 - 7 = 2x + 9. But x = 2, so we have 2(2) + 9 = 4 + 9 = 13. Then we subtract one so there are 12 - 1 = 11.\n### Final Answer: So 11 candies are lemon! I hope this explanation is helpful.
