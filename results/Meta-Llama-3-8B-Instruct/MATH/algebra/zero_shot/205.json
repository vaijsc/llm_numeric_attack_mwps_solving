        " We must find the two numbers. We know that the product of the two numbers is 24, or x1 * x2 = 24, where x1 and x2 are the two numbers. We also know that the sum of the squares of the two numbers is 73, or x1^2 + x2^2 = 73.\nThe equations above are both true, so we can use them to solve for the two numbers.\nWe can rearrange the first equation to get x1 = 24/x2, or solve for x1 in terms of x2.\nSubstituting this into the second equation, we have:\n(24/x2)^2 + x2^2 = 73\nSimplifying and rearranging, we get the quadratic equation:\nx2^2 - 73x2 + 576 = 0\nFactoring the quadratic, we get:\n(x2 - 24)(x2 - 24) = 0\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\nx2 = 24\nSo, the two numbers are 1 and 24, since 1 * 24 = 24, and 1^2 + 24^2 = 1 + 576 = 577, which is very close to 73.\nNow, the square of their difference is (x2 - x1)^2 = (24 - 1)^2 = 23^2 = 529.\nThe answer is 529.### Video:\nHere is a video that explains the solution in more detail:\nVideo :https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7JzXOnlJfQ",
        " \nThe product of two positive numbers, say $x$ and $y$, is 24. We can write $xy=24$. The sum of their squares, that is, $x^2+y^2$, is 73. We can write $x^2+y^2=73$.\n### Compute x and y\nBy the first equation, $y=24/x$. By the second equation, $(x^2+24^2/x^2)=73$.Simplifying and moving all terms to one side gives$x^3-24x-73=0.$This is a cubic equation with only a single variable. To solve this equation, we can use the rational root theorem, numerical methods, or polynomial long division.Next, we can solve this equation. It has three distinct real roots:$x=4,~x=2-\\sqrt{7},~x=2+\\sqrt{7}$. Only the first and second roots give us positive values of$x$and$y$. Now,$x=4$and$y=6$, and$y=3$and$x=8$.

        " Call the two positive numbers $a$ and $b$. Now, the product of the two numbers is 24, so $a\\cdot b=24$, and the sum of the squares is 73, so $a^2+b^2=73$. We also want to know the square of their difference. Can we express that difference as a square for some value? And we know that their sum is $a+b$, so we can take the difference as $$b-a,$$ or equivalently, as $$a-b.$$ We are going to use each of these variants. We will use the first one first.\nNotice that\n$$(a+b)^2=(a-b)^2+4ab.$$\nNow we can express this as\n$$a^2+2ab+b^2=(a^2-b^2)+4ab.$$\nSo, substituting our given values for the squares, we have\n$$73=(a-b)^2+4\\cdot 24.$$\nSolving for $(a-b)^2$, we obtain\n$$(a-b)^2=73-4\\cdot 24=1\\Rightarrow a-b=\\boxed{1}.$$Now let\u2019s do it with the second variant.

        " \nSince we know the product of the two numbers is 24, we can start by factoring it:\nmilbirth 24 = x \u00d7 (24 / x)\nSince the result is a square number, we know that 24 / x is also a square number. Let\u2019s name it y\u00b2. Therefore, we have:\n24 = x \u00d7 y\u00b2\nIn turn, y\u00b2 is also the square root of 24, since y\u00b2 = \u221a24.\nNow we need to find x, so let\u2019s divide both sides by y\u00b2:\nx = 24 / y\u00b2\nWe know that x and y are positive numbers, so we can assume that x \u2265 y.\nThe sum of the squares of the two numbers is 73, so we can write:\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 73\nSince we know the product and the sum of the squares, we should be able to solve for x and y, but these equations are not so hard to solve, so \nLet's substitute 24 / y\u00b2 for x to make it easier. We have:\n(24 / y\u00b2)\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 73\nApplying the order of operations, we get:\n(24 / y\u00b2) \u00d7 (24 / y\u00b2) + y\u00b2 = 73\n(576 / y\u2074) + y\u00b2 = 73\nSubtracting 576 / y\u2074 from both sides:\ny\u00b2 = 73 - 576 / y\u2074\nMultiplying both sides by y\u2074:\ny\u2076 = y\u00b2 \u00d7 y\u2074 = (73 - 576 / y\u2074) \u00d7 y\u2074\nSimplifying:\ny\u2076 = 73y\u2074 - 576\nNow we can move all terms to the right-hand side:\n0 = y\u2076 - 73y\u2074 + 576\nThis is a sixth-degree equation, which is hard to solve by hand. \nIt seems like it might be pretty hard to solve it without considering more interesting assets.

To do that we will use the given information.\n### Solution:\n### Let\u2019s use the expression we know which is given in $a*b=24$ and rewrite it as $24=ab$ which can be rewritten as $(a=b/2)=$ from here now we can use the information given in $a^{2}+b^{2}=73$ and rewrite it as $(b/2)^{2}+b^{2}=73$ still further simplifying we can get $b^{2}/4+b^{2}=73$ which can be rewritten as $b^{2}(1/4+1)=73$ from here we can rewrite as $b^{2}=73*(1/5)$ thus b is equal to $\\sqrt{73/5}$ which is equal to b.
