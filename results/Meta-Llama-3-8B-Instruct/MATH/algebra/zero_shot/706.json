As an extension of my last post, I wanted to share a brief divisibility rule that I discovered for the 2021 A-League Playoff Seedings. Anyone familiar with the table above knows that the scoring system is as follows: 1-3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, and 0 points for a loss.\nThe rule is as follows: In the 2021 A-League, whenever you have a divisibility rule that is a multiple of 2n, where n is a positive integer, then the exponent n is essentially the index number of the polynomial.\nFor example: in the 2021 A-League, whenever a team has a divisibility rule of 10, it equates to 2^3. This means that in order for the team to pass the rule, it needs to have 8 points or more.\n![](/mathematical/divisibility-rule-(1)\nUsing this newfound knowledge reader, you can make sense of the advertised points table. Any team that adds up to the precise number of points in a subset of 4-3 will pass the divisibility rule of 2\\*4, subdivision of 8. The twist is that as teams gain in points, the divisibility rule increases in a complex pattern as seen in the screenshot above.\nThis rule actually made",

        " 2^3\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2^3. I hope it is correct. Many thanks for the patience as I asked for steps to build my understanding. For instance, we have $\\frac{2^{10}-2^8}{2^7-2^6}$. Following steps of a division: $2^{10}-2^8 \u2013 2^7-2^6 = 2^8(2^2-1)-2^6(2^1-1)$. So we have $\\frac{2^8(2^2-1)-2^6(2^1-1)}{2^7-2^6}$. $2^2-1$ = $4-1$ = 3. So, we have $\\frac{2^8(3)-2^6}{2^7-2^6}$ = $\\frac{2^8(3)-2^6}{2^6(2^1-1)}$. $2^1-1$ = $2-1$ = 1. So, we have $\\frac{2^8(3)-2^6}{2^6(1)}$ = $2^8(3)-2^6$. So, $2^8(3)-2^6$ = $2^7(3)(1)-2^6$ = $2^7(3-1)$ = $2^7(2)$ = $2^8(2)$ = $2^9$ = $2^3$. See you next time! Have a great day!
