Also, by summing the squares of $x$ and $y$ and then subtracting $y^2$, we can also write $x^2-y^2=(x+y)(x-y)=3(x-y)$.  Equating these expressions gives $3(x-y)=33$.  Dividing both sides by $3$ yields $x-y=11$.  We can now rewrite the equation $x+y=3$ as $y=3-x$, and we can substitute this value for $y$ in the equation $x-y=11$ to obtain $x-(3-x)=11$ or $2x=14$.

Using this second equation, we can factor it: $$(a+b)(a-b) = 33$$With this, we know that one factor must be $-1$ (because we can check $a-b = 1$ and we get the equation $a+b = 3$). This means $-1$ must be one of the factors, so $33$ must be the other factor. Thus, $$a-b = -33,$$$$a+b = -1.$$We also know $a+b = 3$, so $3 = -1$, which contradicts our assumption. Where did we go wrong? The mistake here is not showing units properly. $$a-b = -1,$$$$a+b = 3.$$Using this, we can solve for $a-b$: $$a-b = -1 \\Rightarrow b-a = 1$$$a+b = 3$$Then we can solve for $a$: $$a = \\frac{b-1}{2}$$We can then rewrite the equation $3 = a+b$ in terms of $b$: $$3 = \\frac{b-1}{2} + b$$We can solve for $b$: $$\\frac{b-1}{2} + b = 3$$ $$2b = 3 + 1$$ $$b = 2$$Plugging in $b = 2$ into our expression for $a$: $$a = \\frac{b-1}{2}$$ $$a = \\frac{2-1}{2}$$ $$a = 1$$Using the expression for $a$ and $b$, we can calculate the absolute value of the difference of the two numbers:\n$$\\lvert a-b\\rvert = \\lvert 1-2\\rvert = 1$$Tha answer is $\\boxed{1}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 1.

        " If we write the sum and difference of squares like so: $x+y=3$ $(x-y)(x+y)=33$\nWe see that $x+y=3$.\nIn the second step, if we multiply the second expression by $x+y$, we get\n$x^2-xy+y^2=33$.  But $x+y=3$ so this becomes $x^2-3y+33$ which we can now solve for $x$ by knowing that $x^2$ and $y$ are real.  From that, we can get $y$ is what we want.  But it\u2019s quite tedious, I would recommend a more straightforward approach.  Let\u2019s think without using $x$ nor $y$, we use $a$ and $b$ instead, and we try to modify it.  And then we can easily get the answer. We can simplify the second expression to become $(x^2+y^2)-xy=33$.

We can multiply both sides by $-1$ to get $xy-y^2=3x-3y$ and then add $33$ to both sides to get $xy-y^2+33=3x-3y+33$, which we can simplify to get $xy+y^2-9=3x-3y$ and add $3^2",

        " \u00a0Let $a$ and $b$ be the two numbers.  We are given that $a+b=3$ and $a^2-b^2=33$.  To factor the equation $a^2-b^2$, we can rewrite it as $$(a-b)(a+b)$$ Given that $a+b=3$, we can write\\begin{align*}\na^2-b^2&=(a-b)(a+b)\\\\\n&=(a-b)3\\\\\n&=3(a-b)\n\\end{align*}Equating this to $33$ gives $3(a-b)=33$ or $a-b=11$.  Therefore, the difference of the two numbers is 11.  Furthermore, the sum is 3.  Thus, the numbers are 6 and -4 for example.  Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{11}$.\nWe can also calculate the value of one number - let\u2019s say $a$ - using the fact that $a+b=3$:\\begin{align*}\na&=3-b\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad a^2&=(3-b)^2\\\\\n&=9-6b+b^2\n\\end{align*}Then we have\n\\begin{align*}\na^2-b^2&=33\\\\\n&=9-6b+b^2-b^2\\\\\n&=9-6b\\\\\n&=3a-b\\\\\n&=33\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad3a&=42\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad a&=\\frac{42}{3}=14\n\\end{align*}Then $3-b=14$, or $b=-11$.

        " First, suppose that $a$ and $b$ are the two numbers.  The sum of the two numbers is $3$, so $a+b=3$.  Our goal is to find the absolute value of the difference of the two numbers, so let\u2019s focus on $|a-b|$.  We can simplify the absolute value by writing $a-b=a+b-2b$, or $|a-b|=|a+b-2b|=|-2b|=\\boxed{2|b|}$.\nWe are given that $a^2-b^2=33$.  This gives us $(a-b)(a+b)=33$.  Since we already know that $a+b=3$, we have $3(a-b)=33$, which means that $a-b=11$.  Recall that we found that $|a-b|=2|b|$.  Therefore, we can write that $2|b|=11$, and $|b|=11/2$.  Recall that we found that $|a-b|=2|b|$, so now we can finally answer the problem: the absolute value of the difference of the two numbers is $|a-b|=2|b|=\\boxed{\\frac{11}{2}}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 11/2. I hope it is correct.  Review of solution\u00f8d0fr4 Today, I reviewed solution_0. First, we know that a+b=3.  Then we solve a^2 - b^2 = 33.  From that we get a + b = 11 and b = 3/2.  Finally, we have a = 3 - b = 3 - 3/2 = 3/2.  So then we have a = 3/2 and b = 3/2 and (a, b) = (3/2, 3/2).  So we have |a-b| = |(3/2) - (3/2)| = |0| = 0.  This is not the answer, however.  So I tried to rewrite a - b = 11 as 2|b| = 11 to get |b| = 11/2.  We then have |a-b| = 2|b| = 2 * 11/2 = 11/2.\nI think the mistake appears to be that the initial value substitution a = b = 3",
