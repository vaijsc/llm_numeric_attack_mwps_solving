    "solution": "If $x^2+25x+c$ is the square of a binomial, then because the coefficient of $x^2$ is $1$, the binomial must be of the form $x+a$ for some $a$.\n\nExpanding, we have $(x+a)^2 = x^2 + 2ax + a^2$. For this to be equal to $x^2+25x+c$, the coefficients of $x$ must agree, so $2a$ must be equal to $25$. This gives $a=\\frac{25}2$, and so the constant term $a^2$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{625}4}$.",

        " For $x^2+25x+c$, there is no need to complete the square because what we need to do is factor the expression.

First, shifting the constant up and down and left and right, and then we see that if we shift it to $(x+25/2)^2$, we would have $-25^2/4$ on the right side, so $c$ must be positive in order to not create any peninulate.

        " To do this question, we first take the square of the binomial and compare with the expression. Let's say the binomial is $\\left(a+b\\right)$. Therefore, $$(a+b)^2=a^2+2ab+b^2=a^2+2ab+b^2$$ We want to compare this with $x^2+25x+c$. Then, $$(a+b)^2=x^2+25x+c,$$ $$a^2+2ab+b^2=x^2+25x+c,$$ Now we can eliminate all the \"x terms\" If $a=1, ab=25/2$. This can be written as $a=25/2\\cdot b$. We substitute it into the equation.

        " We know that $x^2+25x+c$ is equal to the square of a binomial. We can write it as $(x+a)^2$ for some constant $a$. Expanding the right side, we have $$x^2+2ax+a^2.$$Setting these equal, we obtain \\begin{align*} x^2+2ax+a^2&=x^2+25x+c\\\\ 2ax+a^2&=25x+c. \\end{align*}Simplifying the right side, we have\n$$\\boxed{a^2+25=-2ac}.$$Since the LHS does not depend on $x$, then neither should the RHS. This implies that $a$ cannot be a variable: it must be a constant. Thus $2ac$ cannot depend on $x$. In other words, $c=0$ or $a=0$. But if $a=0$, then $x^2+25x+c$ is not equal to the square of a binomial. Thus $c=0$. Plugging this into $a^2+25=-2ac$ above, we obtain $a^2+25=0$, and so $a=\\boxed{-5}$.
