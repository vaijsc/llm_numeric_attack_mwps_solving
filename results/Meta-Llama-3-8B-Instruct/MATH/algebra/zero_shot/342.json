        " For any function $f(x)$, its domain is the set of all real numbers $x$ for which $f(x)$ is well-defined (i.e., not undefined). For $f(x)$ as given, it is given in \u201cfactored form,\u201d which makes it simpler to determine its domain. To find the domain, we can set each denominator equal to $0$ and solve for $x$ in each case. For example, we have that $$x^2-7=0\\Rightarrow x^2=7\\Rightarrow x=\\pm\\sqrt{7}.$$ Therefore, $x=\\sqrt{7}$ and $x=-\\sqrt{7}$ are not in the domain of $f$, since $x$ cannot be imaginary in the real numbers. Similarly, we have that $$x^3-8=0\\Rightarrow x^3=8\\Rightarrow x=2,$$ so $x=2$ is not in the domain of $f$, since $x$ cannot be a constant. Finally, we have that $$x^4-9=0\\Rightarrow x^4=9\\Rightarrow x=\\pm3.$$ Thus, $x=3$ and $x=-3$ are not in the domain of $f$, since $x$ cannot be an integer.

        " Since the first term of the function $$f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2-7} + \\frac{1}{x^3-8} + \\frac{1}{x^4-9}$$ is $\\dfrac{1}{x^2-7}$, we need $x^2-7\\neq0$ which implies $x^2\\neq7$. Because $x^2$ can never be positive, and $7$ is always positive, the inequality must be $x^2<0$, so $x$ is always an imaginary number.\nWe also need to find when $x^3-8$ and $x^4-9$ are not zeros. So we need $x^3\\neq8$ and $x^4\\neq9$. In this case $x^3>8$ and $x^3<-8$ because all the terms are squared, similarly $x^4>9$ and $x^4<0$. No real number satisfy those inequalities, because all real numbers satisfy $x^2>0$. In conclusion we find all $x$ that satisfy $x^2<0$, so $x^2=25+i,~25-i$, then with the quadratic formula $x$ is $\\sqrt{-4}\\pm 0i ~/~2 \\pm \\sqrt{-1}~i$, or $x= \\pm 1 + sqrt(-1)~~$.

In this problem the instructor is asking for \"the sum of all real numbers $x$ that are not in the domain of the function\". \nThe best way to solve this problem is to first understand the question and then solve it step by step. In this case, the instructor is asking for the sum of random numbers that are not in the domain, so we have to first identify the domain of the function. The first step is to identify the domain of the function.\nThe domain of this function is all real numbers except $x$ such that $x^2-7=0$ or $x^3-8=0$ or $x^4-9=0$.\nThe first term is given by $\\dfrac{1}{x^2",

Thus, the only real numbers $x$ that are not in the domain are $\\sqrt{7}$ and $-\\sqrt{7}$. The sum of these is $\\sqrt{7}+(-\\sqrt{7})=\\boxed{0}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 0.

The given equation shows that these are not in the domain. For the remaining $x$, the expression will not equal zero.\nNow, we would like to determine the domain of the sum.

        " The expression is troublesome because there are three terms involved, which makes it hard to identify a crucial information from it.  The denominator of each term is either quadratic, cubic or quartic.  Can one term potentially have an empty set of solutions? Of course yes, for instance say the cubic has no real solutions.  Then that term would be absent for all real $x$.\nWe know from the fundamental theorem of algebra that a polynomial of degree $n$ has $n$ complex roots.  So $x^4 - 9$ has $4$ roots.  If all of them are real, all four of them must split into two pairs of real conjugate roots.  It is known that quadratic equation $x^2 + bx + c$ has no real solutions if $b^2 - 4ac <0$.  For the expression $\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{x^4-9}=\\frac{1}{(x^2+\\sqrt{3}x+1)(x^2-\\sqrt{3}x+1)}$, $b = 2\\sqrt{3}$ and $ac = -3$, so when $x^2+\\sqrt{3}x+1$ and $x^2-\\sqrt{3}x+1$ have no real solutions, we get the answer, i.e., $3-\\sqrt{3}$ and $3+\\sqrt{3}$.  No other polynomial factors can have such roots because their sum of coefficients will be different.  The other two factors $x^3 - 8$ and $x^2-7$ are saved because they have odd degree, and by rational root theorem, cannot have at least one real root.  So, the denominator $x^4-9$ is the culprit.\nWe combine all together to write the answer as $$\\boxed{-3+\\sqrt{3}+3-\\sqrt{3} = \\boxed{0}.}$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 0.
