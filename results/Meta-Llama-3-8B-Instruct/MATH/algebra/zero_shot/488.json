The innermost expressions is\n$$\\sqrt{x\\cdot\\sqrt{x}}=\\sqrt{x\\cdot x}=\\sqrt{x^2}=x$$ So the expression becomes\n$$\\sqrt{x\\cdot\\sqrt{x\\cdot\\sqrt{x}\\cdots}}=\\sqrt x\\sqrt{\\sqrt{x\\cdot\\sqrt{x\\cdot\\sqrt{x}\\cdots}}}$$ Step 2: Simplify the expression further\nWe also can simplify the second square root using the same approach\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sqrt{x\\cdot\\sqrt{x\\cdot\\sqrt{x}\\cdots}}&=\\sqrt x\\sqrt{\\sqrt{x\\cdot\\sqrt{x\\cdot\\sqrt{x}\\cdots}}}\\\\\n&=\\sqrt x\\sqrt{\\sqrt{x\\cdot\\sqrt{x}}}\\\\\n&=\\sqrt x\\sqrt{\\sqrt{x^2}}\\\\\n&=\\sqrt x\\sqrt{x}\\\\\n&=\\sqrt{x^2}\\\\\n&=x\n\\end{align*} So the final expression is $x$ too.
