Q = $\\frac{5}{3}$ * P\nQ = $\\frac{5}{3}$ * (-44)\nQ = -72.75\nNow, add 8 to Q: Q+8 = -72.75+8\nQ+8 = -64.75\nThe greater of the two numbers is Q+8, which is 64.75. This is the correct solution.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 64.75. I hope it is correct. \nThe problem does seem a bit complicated, but let's break it down step by step:\n1. The first ratio is given as 3:5. This means that the two numbers, P and Q, have a ratio of 3:5. This can be written as:\n$\\frac{P}{Q} = \\frac{3}{5}$\n2. Then, it is given that 4 is subtracted from P and 8 is added to Q, and the new ratio becomes 2:7. This can be written as:\n$\\frac{P-4}{Q+8} = \\frac{2}{7}$\n3. Cross-multiply the equation:\n$7P-28 = 2Q+16$\n4. Add 28 to both sides of the equation to get:\n$7P = 2Q+44$\n5. Multiply both sides of the equation by 5 to get:\n$35P = 10Q+220$\n",

Now multiplying by $7y+56$, we obtain $7x-28=2y+16$. Now solving for $y$ gives us $y=15x-56$, then the lesser number $x$ is unknown.  Substituting $y$ into $a$, we get $a=3x-20$.  Since new ratio is $2:7$, from $a:b=2:7$, we can get $b=7a/2$.  Substituting $a=3x-20$ gives us $b=\\frac{7(3x-20)}{2}$.  Now solve for $b$, we have $b=7x-40$, then the greater number.  We get the greater number as $y+8=b+8=7x-32=15x-56+16=15x-40$.  So we get the greater number as $b=15x-40$.  We can also get $y=b+8-8=15x-48$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 8.

What is the probability that a randomly selected test taker scores above $96$? Since we are dealing with a normal distribution, we can use z-score calculation: $z=(x-\\mu)/\\sigma=(96-80)/4=1$. Since $z$ is $1$, the corresponding cumulative probability using the z-table or calculator is $0.8416$. We need the probability that a randomly selected test taker scores above $96$, so we subtract the cumulative probability $0.8416$ from $1$ to get $0.1584$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 0.1584.

        " The ratio of the two numbers is initially $3:5$ so the greater number is $5x$ and the lesser number is $3x$. \nSo we have $3x - 4$ and $5x + 8$.\nNow, the new ratio is $\\frac{2}{7}$, so the new numbers are in the ratio of $2:7$, so $\\frac{3x-4}{5x+8} = \\frac{2}{7}$.\nWe can equate both sides. Cross multiplying, $7(3x-4) = 2(5x+8)$, $21x-28 = 10x+16$, \nAdding 28 to both sides we have $21x = 44$ and dividing by 21 we get $x = 2$.\nSo the greater number is $5x = 10 + 8 = \\boxed{18}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 18. I hope it is correct. \tJ\nLet\u2019s think step by step.\n### "
