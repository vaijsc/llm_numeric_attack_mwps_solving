        " \nFor the expression \\(\\frac{x-3}{x^2-10x+16}\\) to be undefined, the denominator must be equal to zero. Hence we must solve the equation \\(x^2-10x+16=0\\). We can do this using the quadratic formula:\n$$\nx=\\frac{10\\pm\\sqrt{100-64}}{2}=\\frac{10\\pm\\sqrt{36}}{2}=\\frac{10\\pm6}{2}=5\\pm3.\n$$\nTherefore, the values of $x$ are $5-3=2$ and $5+3=8$.

        " \nThe expression $\\frac{x-3}{x^2-10x+16}$ is only undefined if its denominator is equal to zero. In other words, we have to solve the equation $x^2-10x+16=0$, which we do by factoring:\n\\begin{align*}\nx^2-10x+16&=0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad(x-8)(x-2)&=0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x&=8,\\,2.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, the sum of all values of $x$ for which the expression $\\frac{x-3}{x^2-10x+16}$ is undefined is $\\boxed{8+2=10}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 10.

I hope it is correct. $$x = 4$$\n### Final Answer: The final answer is -8 and 4. I hope it is correct. $$x = -8, 4$$\nThat is indeed correct. In order for a rational expression to be undefined, the denominator must equal zero. That occurs when $(x-4)^2 = 0.$ Solving, we find that $x-4=0\\Rightarrow x=\\boxed{4}$. $$x = -8, 4$$\nGiven that \\frac{x-3}{x^2-10x+16} is undefined implies that x^2-10x+16=0. Factoring this quadratic, we obtain (x-4)^2=0, so x=4. Therefore, the sum of the values for which the expression is undefined is x=4=\\boxed{-8+4=-4}. Alternate Solution: In order for the rational function to be undefined it must mean that the denominator is zero. So, by plugging in 0 to the denominator you can solve for the undefined values. x^2-10x+16=0, factoring it gives (x-4)^2 = 0. Therefore x-4=0, x=4. So the expression is undefined at x=4. Since there is only one value for which the expression is undefined it must be the sum of the undefined values is x=4. $\\boxed{x =",

To solve the quadratic equation, we have $x=\\frac{-(-10)+\\sqrt{(-10)^2-4(1)(16)}}{2(1)}=5-\\sqrt{16-40}=\\frac{5-6}{1}$ and $x=\\frac{-(-10)-\\sqrt{(-10)^2-4(1)(16)}}{2(1)}=5+\\sqrt{16-40}=\\frac{5-(-1)}{1}$.

The numerator is zero when $x^2-10x+16=0$ (Note that $x-3$ is the numerator, and $x^2-10x+16$ is the denominator). If we break it down to $(x-5-\\sqrt{9})(x-5+\\sqrt{9})=0$. Then it means $x=5+\\sqrt{9}$ or $x=5-\\sqrt{9}$. The sum of these two solutions is answer choice \\boxed{2}.\n### Solution:\nThe expression $\\frac{x-3}{x^2-10x+16}$ is undefined when $x-3=0$, but $x^2-10x+16\\neq 0$. This is the case when $x-3=0$ and $x^2-10x+16\\neq 0$. If we solve these equations, we get $x=3$ and $x^2-10x+16\\neq 0$, noting that $x^2-10x+16=x^2-8x-2x+16=x(x-8)-2(x-8)=(x-8)(x-2)=0$.

Therefore, it is undefined when $x = 2$ or $x = 8$. Hence, the sum of $x$ for which it is undefined is 2 + 8 = 10.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 10.

        " Using the concept of undefined expressions, we note that $$\\frac{x-3}{x^2-10x+16}$$ is undefined when the denominator equals zero.
