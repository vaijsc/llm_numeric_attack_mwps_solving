So, we need more equations in order to solve for $x$. We are given that to solve this system, we need two more equations. Since this system consists of two equations and three variables, we know that we cannot uniquely determine the value of $x$ (or $y$ or $z$). We have to find two more equations to this system in order to find the unique value of $x$. \\textbf{FIRST QUESTION:} We are only given with two equations but there are three variables. How do you intend to find the value of x using these two equations and two more equations? We can either find $z$ first and then plug it into one of the given equations, or we can use any other method. This is when we have to be creative and exploit intuition. For example, we can try to find a way to eliminate $z$ so that we have two equations with only two variables. Please post your answer, and I will let you know if you are correct or not. (2022/6/26)\n### Error: Guess!\nThe model's attempt to solve the system of linear equations by trying to eliminate $z$ and using the values of $y$ and $z$ to find $x$ is not correct.

For example, if we solve the second equation for $z$, we get $z=-8/3+4y/12=2y/3-8/3$. If we substitute $z=2y/3-8/3$ into the equation $3x-8z=-22$, we get:\n\\begin{align*}\n3x-8\\left(2y/3-8/3\\right)&=-22\\\\\n3x-16y/3+32/3&=-22\\\\\n3x-16y/3&=-22+32/3\\\\\n3x-16y/3&=-22/3+32/3\\\\\n3x-16y/3&=10/3.\n\\end{align*}\nNow we have one equation and one unknown: $3x-16y/3=10/3$.

        " If\nThe system of equations is equivalent to the following single equation\n$$3(3x+4y-12z)-12(-2x-3y+9z)=10-12(-4)$$\nUsig the distributive Law and the subtraction rule for the sum of numbers,\n\\begin{align*}\n9x+12y-36z+24x+36y-108z&=40,\\\\\n9x+24x-36z-108z&=40-12y-36y,\\\\\n33x-144z&=40-12y-36y.\n\\end{align*}\nUsing the subtraction rule for the sum of numbers,\n\\begin{align*}\n33x-144z&=40-12y-36y,\\\\\n33x-144z&=40-48y,\\\\\n33x-144z+48y&=40.\\\\\n\\end{align*}\nTherefore, we can write \\begin{align*}\n33x+48y-144z&=40.\n\\end{align*}But since we are using the question if, the given equation, we should use only the 1st equation, $$3x+4y-12z=10,$$and do substitution for $y$ in the equation above, \\begin{align*}\n33x+48y-144z&=40.\\\\\n33x+48(3x+4y-12z)-144z&=40,\\\\\n33x+144x+192y-576z&=40,\\\\\n177x+192y-576z&=40,\\\\\n33x+48y-144z&=40.\n\\end{align*}\nSo, substituting $y$ in the 2nd equation with the given equation,\n\\begin{align*}\n3x+4y-12z&=10\\\\\n3x+4(3x+4y-12z)-12z&=10,\\\\\n3x+12x+16y-48z&=10,\\\\\n15x+16y-48z&=10.\n\\end{align*}\nEquating the two equations,\n\\begin{align*}\n177x+192y-576z&=40,\\\\\n15x+16y-48z&=10,\\\\\n177x-162x+192y-",
        " If\n\\begin{align*}\n3x+4y-12z&=10,\\\\\n-2x-3y+9z&=-4,\n\\end{align*}\ncompute $x$.\nLet\u2019s solve a system of linear equations. This is straightforward by the method of substitution and elimination. Exchanging the equations, it is through the elimination of $y$ that we can get an answer much faster. Let us add $2$ times the first equation to the second one to obtain\n\\begin{align*}\n5x+7z&=6.\n\\end{align*}\nMultiply this by $3$ to obtain\n$$15x+21z=18.$$Now, we solve the given equations.\n$$3x+4y-12z=10,$$$$-2x-3y+9z=-4.$$\nAdding the first equation to twice the second equation, we get\n$$5x+7z=6.$$Dividing both sides by 5, we obtain\n$$x=\\frac{6}{5}-\\frac{7}{5}z.$$The unknown is $x$. Depending on the value of $z$, $x$ will be calculated as follows:\n$$\\color{Red}{x=\\frac{6}{5}-\\frac{7}{5}z}.$$$Sieving Finite Videos showing Window $z=1$, we will have\n$$x=0.$$$z=-1$, we will have\n$$x=\\frac{8}{5}.$$$z=-2$, we will have\n$$x=\\frac{16}{5}.$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\frac{6}{5}-\\frac{7}{5}z. I hope it is correct. 3x+4y-12z&=10 \\\\ -2x-3y+9z&=-4 First, multiply the first equation by 2, and the second equation by 3. Then, add the two equations to eliminate y. 6x+8y-24z&=20 \\\\ -6x-9y+27z&=-12 Adding the two equations we get: -z=8 Now subtract 8 from both sides of the equation: z=-8 Now substitute z=-8 in the original equations. Now simplify the equations. 3x+4y-12(-8)&=10 \\\\ -2x-3y+9(-8)&=-4 "
