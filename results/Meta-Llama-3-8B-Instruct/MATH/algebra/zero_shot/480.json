        " First, we know that the problem gives $\\frac{1}{p} + \\frac{1}{q} = 1$ and that $p, q>1$ are real numbers. Next, we know that $1 < p,q < \\infty$ as the sum of any real number with 1 will be greater than 1. So given $\\frac{1}{p} + \\frac{1}{q} = 1$, we know that $(1\\times p)\\div(p\\times1)+\\frac{1\\times q}{1\\times q}=1$ Simplifying, we get $1+\\frac{q}{pq}=1\\to pq=q$. Therefore, we know that this means that $\\frac{q}{p}=1$, so $p=q$. So then we have $p=q$ and since $p>1$, $p=q>1$. Taking $(p-1)\\times(q-1)$, we get a product of some numbers. We know that if $p=q$, their product will simply be $(p-1)^2$ Notice that we started the problem with $p=q$ and $p>1$, which means $q>1$ Therefore, since $(p-1)^2 = (1)^2(p-1)^2$, it follows that $\\boxed{(p-1)(q-1) = 0}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 0. I hope it is correct.",
        " The key clue in this problem is $\\frac{1}{p} + \\frac{1}{q} = 1$. To solve this problem, we can put $\\frac{1}{p} = 1 - \\frac{1}{q}$. Since $p > 1$, we have that $p = \\frac{q}{q-1}$, and since $q > 1$, we have that $q = \\frac{p}{p-1}$. Substituting these values into the expression given, we see that\n$$(p-1)(q-1) = \\frac{q}{q-1} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{p}{p-1} - 1 \\right) = \\frac{p}{p-1} \\cdot \\left( 1 - \\frac{q}{p} \\right) = \\frac{p-q}{p-1} = \\boxed{p-q}.$$\nNote that $p > q$, since the expressions for $p$ and $q$ have the same units and the numerators have the same value. Therefore, the answer is $p-q$. You can also verify by plugging in some values for $p$ and $q$. For example, if we take $p = 3$ and $q = 2$, $\\frac{1}{p} + \\frac{1}{q} = 1$ is satisfied.\n### Solution 2:\nWe can solve for $p$ and $q$ instead.\n$\\frac{1}{p} + \\frac{1}{q} = 1 \\implies \\frac{q+p}{pq} = 1 \\implies q+p = pq \\implies pq-q-p = 0 \\implies (p-1)(q-1) = \\boxed{p-q}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is p-q. I hope it is correct.\n### References:\nAfter the solution: You can also prove the identity on the line immediately after $p+q=pq$ step and before $pq-q-p=0$ step. Using p, q>1, to divide both sides, we get p=q-1. Substituting back into p+q=pq, we get p+p-1=pq, or p^2-qp+p-1=0. Solving this equation by polynomial division (or synthetic division) yields the quotient is 1 and the remainder",
        " We know that $\\frac{1}{p} + \\frac{1}{q} = 1$. In addition, we know that $p > 1$ and $q > 1$, so we can multiply by $pq$ to get $q + p = pq$. Now, we factor $pq$ from both sides to get $q$ and $p$ as factors of $pq$, which becomes $(p + q) = pq$. Finally, we can distribute $p$ from $(p + q)$ on the left-hand side and $q$ from $(q + p)$ on the right-hand side by using commutative property. Hence, $(q + p) = pq$ gives us $p(q - 1) = q(p - 1)$.\nTo solve this, we introduce a variable $x = p - 1$:\n### Solution:\nTo find $(p-1)(q-1)$, substitute $x=p-1$ and $p = 1+x$. So, the expression $\\frac{1}{p}+\\frac{1}{q}=1$ translates into:\n$\\\\ \\frac{1}{1+x}+\\frac{1}{1+x^{-1}}=1$\nNow let us multiply across the equation, find a common denominator and get rid of the fractional terms to finally derive an equation involving $x$:\n$\\\\x^2+1-2x^{-1}=0\\\\\\\\$\nDifferentiate both sides, see what we can to solve for $x$, and try to relate $x$ to both $p$ and $q$. And, we get:\nx=1.\\\\$",
        " $$\\frac{1}{p}+\\frac{1}{q}=1$$ Adding $\\frac{1}{p}$ and $\\frac{1}{q}$ gives us 1. Let's multiply both sides by $pq$.\n$$\\frac{p}{p}+\\frac{q}{q}=pq$$Now we (sort of) recognize that $\\frac{p}{p}$ and $\\frac{q}{q}$ are simply 1, so we can simplify to get $p+q=pq$. Subtract $p$ from both sides and we get $q=pq-p$.  Move the $q$ onto the RHS as well, and this gives us $0=p(q-1)-q$. To make the problem easier, we can slide a simple fraction onto the RHS: $$0=\\frac{p}{1}(q-1)-q$$  Now we can see that the denominator of this fraction is 1, and we can multiply both sides by that: $$0=p(q-1)-q\\cdot1$$ Add $q$ to both sides, giving us $p(q-1)=q$. To solve for $q-1$, we can subtract $p$ from both sides: $$p(q-1)-p=q-p$$  Simplify this a bit to get $q-p=(q-1)$.  Then, add $p$ to both sides for another simplification: $$q=p+(q-1)$$Simplifying this again, we get $q=p+q-1$.\nNow, subtract $q$ from both sides to get $$0=p-q+1$$Add $q$ to both sides: $$q=p+1$$ Lastly, substitute this value for $q$ into the formula given in the problem.\n\\begin{align*}\n(p-1)(q-1) &= (p-1)(p+1-1)\\\\\n&= (p-1)(p)\\\\\n&= \\boxed{p^2-p}\\\\\n\\end{align*}\nFinal Answer: The final answer is p^2-p.

This means that $q \\neq r$ is possible only when $q = 0$. But since we are given that $q > 1$, we must have that $q - r = 0$, so $q = r$. Now, $r = pq = q(1) = q$, and $q > 1$, so $q > 0$.  Hence, $r > 0$.  It follows that $r - 1 = q - 1$. Now, let $p = q + 1$. Then $q = p - 1$, and $r = pq = p(p-1) = p^2-p$, so $r - 1 = (p-1)(p-2)$.

I hope it is correct. ### How did they solve it? Among other methods, this problem can be solved by Vieta's formulas. I believe the solution given above is particularly neat, though. It's a bit handwavy, but it's an elegant way to solve the problem!  It uses the fact that $p-1$ is the product of the roots of the equation $x^{p} = x$, which gives $x^{q} = 1$, so that $(x-1)^{p-1} = x - 1$ and $p-1 = \\frac{q}{q-1}$.  The rest follows quickly from here. It's not immediately clear why this works without some exposure to algebraic geometry or number theory, but isn't it amazing that the formula $\\frac{p}{p-1}=x\\Rightarrow p=\\frac{x}{x-1}+\\frac{x-1}{(x-1)^2}$ has a hidden use in this problem?  Yes!  Another way to solve the problem is to substitute the given expression of $\\frac{1}{p}+\\frac{1}{q}=1$ into $\\frac{p}{p-1}+\\frac{q}{q-1}=\\frac{p-1}{q-1}+\\frac{q-1}{p-",
        " We have $\\frac{1}{p} + \\frac{1}{q} = 1$. Hence, $p+q=pq$, since $p$ and $q$ are both greater than 1. So $q=\\frac{p^2}{p-1}$, implying $q-1 = \\frac{p^2-p+1}{p-1}$, and therefore $\\boxed{(p-1)(q-1) = p}.$\nNote: To solve this problem, it helps to start by setting up an equation corresponding to the given information, even if it seems somewhat obvious. The equation $p+q=pq$ works nicely because it is straightforward to rearrange this expression to eliminate $q$ and get an expression involving $p$ only. From there, we know that the solution involves a linear combination of $p$ and $q,$ so knowing that $q=\\frac{p^2}{p-1}$, which can be derived by solving the equation $p+q=pq$, allows us to rewrite $(p-1)(q-1)$ in terms of $p$. Finally, after simplification, we see that the value of $(p-1)(q-1)$ is simply $p$, as desired.\nMAT-SE GeoGebra Web Version\u00a0\u00a0(C) Copyright 2020 GeoGebra.org \nHome | About | Documentation | Support | Suggest Activity | Contact \u03ac\\system\\webcore\\DisplayPage.php(201): unknown() \u03ac\\system\\webcore\\DisplayPage.php(201): unknown() \u03ac\\system\\webcore\\ORM.Record.php(115): DisplayPage->socialnetwork()  Referenced by: unknown() Warning: Unknown: unable to write to /tmp/geoGebra-Dev-Tmp/11335.php.cache in Unknown on line 0 Warning: Unknown: unable to write to /tmp/geoGebra-Dev-Tmp/11335.php.cache in Unknown on line 0 Warning: Unknown: unable to write to /tmp/geoGebra-Dev-Tmp/11335.php.cache in Unknown on line 0 Warning: Unknown: unable to write to /tmp/geoGebra-Dev-Tmp/11335.php.cache in Unknown on line 0 Warning: Unknown: unable to write to /tmp/geoGebra-Dev-Tmp/11335.php.cache in Unknown on line 0 Warning: Unknown: unable to write to /tmp/geoGebra-Dev-Tmp/11335",
