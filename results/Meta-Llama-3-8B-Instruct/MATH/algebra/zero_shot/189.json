        " Let $a$ be the difference of the roots of the quadratic equation. Then the quadratic equation can be factored as:$$x^2 + bx + c = (x - r)(x - s) = x^2 - (r+s)x + rs$$where $r$ and $s$ are the roots of the quadratic equation. Comparing the coefficients of the variables, we have:\n\\begin{align*}\nr+s&= -b\\\\\nrs&=c\\\\\n\\end{align*}\nThe difference $a$ of the roots of the quadratic equation is given by:\n$$a = |r - s| = |-b| = |b|$$\nThen, using the second equation $rs = c$ , we have:\n$$|b|^2 = (r+s)^2 - 4rs = b^2 - 4c$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad |b|^2 &= b^2 - 4c\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad -4c &= b^2 - |b|^2\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad -4c &= b^2 - b^2 + b^2 - 4b^2\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 4b^2 &=4b^2 + 4c\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad c &= 0\\\\\n&\\boxed{\\text{or}}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 0 &= 4b^2 + 4c\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 0 &= b^2 + c\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 0 &= (b - 2c)^2 - 4c\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 0 &= |b-2c|\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 0 &= |b - 2(0)|\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 0 &= |b|\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad b &= 0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad c &= \\boxed{0}\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n### Alternate solution:\nNote that we know that \\begin{align*}\nx^2+bx+c&=\\left(x+\\frac{b}{2}\\right)^2-\\frac{b^2}{4}+c\\\\\n&=\\left(x+\\frac{b}{2}\\right)^2-\\left(\\frac{b}{2}\\right)^2+\\frac{c}{\\frac{b"
