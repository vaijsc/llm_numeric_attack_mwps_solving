        "To determine how many vertical asymptotes the graph of the function \\( y = \\frac{x-3}{x^2 + 7x - 30} \\) has, we need to find the points where the function is undefined. This happens when the denominator is equal to zero, provided that the numerator does not also equal zero at those points.\nWe start by finding the roots of the denominator:\n\\[ x^2 + 7x - 30 = 0. \\]\nWe can factor this quadratic equation. We are looking for two numbers that multiply to \\(-30\\) and add to \\(7\\). These numbers are \\(10\\) and \\(-3\\). Thus, we factor the quadratic as follows:\n\\[ x^2 + 7x - 30 = (x + 10)(x - 3). \\]\nNow, we set the factors equal to zero to find the roots:\n1. \\( x + 10 = 0 \\) which gives \\( x = -10 \\)\n2. \\( x - 3 = 0 \\) which gives \\( x = 3 \\)\nNext, we need to check whether the numerator also equals zero at these roots.\nThe numerator is:\n\\[ x - 3. \\]\nAt \\( x = 3 \\):\n\\[ x - 3 = 3 - 3 = 0. \\]\nThis means that at \\( x = 3 \\), both the numerator and the denominator equal zero, so there is no vertical asymptote at this point; instead, there is likely a hole in the graph at \\( x = 3 \\).\nAt \\( x = -10 \\):\n\\[ x - 3 = -10 - 3 = -13 \\neq 0. \\]\nThis indicates that the numerator does not equal zero at \\( x = -10\\), so there is a vertical asymptote at this point.\nIn conclusion, the graph of \\( y = \\frac{x-3}{x^2 + 7x - 30} \\) has one vertical asymptote.\nThus, the answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]",

        " We know that x is a root of a polynomial (i.e. x is a solution to the equation) if the polynomial evaluated at x is equal to 0. In other words, $f(x)=0$ if and only if x is a solution to $f(x)=0.$ Therefore, we must find the roots of $f(x) = x^2+7x-30.$\nWe find these roots by first factoring. Factoring a quadratic polynomial, $$f(x) = ax^2+b_x + c,$$where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are real numbers, and $a \\ne 0$, means expressing it as a product of two linear factors $$(x-r_1)(x-r_2).$$\nFor our given polynomial, we have $a=1$, $b=7$, and $c=-30.$ We first notice that we can write\n$$(x-3)(x+10)=x^2+7x-30.$$We used the distribution property with $x-3$ and $(x+10)$, multiplying each term inside each parenthesis.\nTherefore, the polynomial factors as $x^2+7x-30=(x-3)(x+10).$ We have found that $x-3$ and $x+10$ are factors. But the quadratic formula tells us that x is a root of $f(x)$ if $x-3$ and/or $x+10$ are equal to 0. Hence, we need the roots of $x-3=0$ and $x+10=0.$ These are\n\\begin{align*}\nx&=3,\\\\\nx&=-10.\n\\end{align*}These three equations are saying that x can be 3, it can also be negative 10.\nWe know that when something is divided by $x-3$ and $x+10$ simultaneously, the original equation is equivalent to $$y=\\frac{\\color{#D61F06}{1}}{\\color{#D61F06}{(x-3)(x+10)}}.$$The reason is that in the case of linear factors, we can distribute them over the quotient: $$y=\\frac{\\color{#D61F06}{x-3}}{\\color{#D61F06}{x-3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\color{#D61F06}{x+10}}.$$and",
