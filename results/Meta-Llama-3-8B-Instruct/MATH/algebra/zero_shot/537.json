Therefore, by the quadratic formula,\n$$x=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a},$$we can write\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{-7\\pm i\\sqrt{15}}{8}&=\\frac{-7\\pm\\sqrt{7^2-4(4)k}}{2(4)}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad -7\\pm i\\sqrt{15}&=-7\\pm\\sqrt{49-16k}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad i\\sqrt{15}&=\\sqrt{49-16k}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 15&=49-16k\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 16k&=49-15=34\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad\\boxed{k&=-\\frac{17}{8}}.\n\\end{align*}\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -\\frac{17}{8}. I hope it is correct. If you need more information or tutorial, please let me know.### ",
        " We have:\nIf we denote $r_1 = \\frac{-7 - i \\sqrt{15}}{8}$ and $r_2 = \\frac{-7 + i \\sqrt{15}}{8}$, then\n$$x^2 + \\frac{7}{4} x + \\frac{49}{64} - \\frac{15}{64} = 0$$ $$x^2 + \\frac{7}{4} x + \\frac{34}{64} = 0$$ Now, apply the quadratic formula:\n\\begin{align*}\nx &= \\frac{-\\frac{7}{4} \\pm \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{7}{4}\\right)^2 - 4\\cdot 1 \\cdot \\frac{34}{64}}}{2}\\\\\nx &= \\frac{-\\frac{7}{4} \\pm \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{7}{4}\\right)^2 - \\frac{137}{64}}}{2}\\\\\nx &= \\frac{-\\frac{7}{4} \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{49}{16} - \\frac{137}{64}}}{2}\\\\\nx &= \\frac{-\\frac{7}{4} \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{(49 - 137)}{64}}}{2}\\\\\nx &= \\frac{-\\frac{7}{4} \\pm \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{primer}{8}\\right)}}{2}\\\\\nx &= \\frac{-\\frac{7}{4} \\pm i \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{4}}{2}\\\\\nx &= \\frac{-7 \\pm i\\sqrt{15}}{8}\n\\end{align*}\nSo we have the correct values of $r_1 = \\frac{-7 - i\\sqrt{15}}{8}$ and $r_2 = \\frac{-7 + i\\sqrt{15}}{8}$. But we want to find $k$.\nWe use the fact that\n$$r_1 + r_2 = -\\frac{7}{4}$$\nThus, associating a sum term to $(-\\frac{7}{4})$ and a difference term to $\\frac{k}{4}$, $$(-\\frac{7}{4})\\cdot(-7) + \\frac{k}{4} = -\\frac{7}{4}$$ $$\\frac{49}{4} + \\frac{k}{4",
        " Let $r$ be the smaller root and $s$ be the larger root.  According to the complex root formula, we have that \\begin{align*} r+s &= \\frac{-7}{4},\\\\ r s&=\\frac{k}{4}. \\end{align*} Since $r=\\frac{-7-i\\sqrt{15}}{8}$ and $s=\\overline{r}=\\frac{-7+i\\sqrt{15}}{8}$, we have that \\begin{align*} r+s&=\\frac{-7-i\\sqrt{15}}{8}+\\frac{-7+i\\sqrt{15}}{8}\\\\ &=\\frac{-14}{8}\\\\ &=-\\frac{7}{4},\\\\ r s &=\\left(\\frac{-7-i\\sqrt{15}}{8}\\right)\\left(\\frac{-7+i\\sqrt{15}}{8}\\right)\\\\ &=\\frac{49+15}{64}=\\frac{64}{64}=1. \\end{align*} Therefore, we have that $\\frac{k}{4}=1$, and hence, $\\boxed{k=4}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 4.
