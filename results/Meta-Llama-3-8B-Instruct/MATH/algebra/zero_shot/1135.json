        "To find the greatest integer value of \\( x \\) for which \\( 6x^2 + x - 2 < 0 \\), we can start by solving the equation \\( 6x^2 + x - 2 = 0 \\) to find the critical points where the quadratic expression changes sign.\nFirst, we apply the quadratic formula:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\nFor the quadratic \\( 6x^2 + x - 2 \\):\n- \\( a = 6 \\)\n- \\( b = 1 \\)\n- \\( c = -2 \\)\nNow, we calculate the discriminant \\( b^2 - 4ac \\):\n\\[\nb^2 - 4ac = 1^2 - 4 \\cdot 6 \\cdot (-2) = 1 + 48 = 49\n\\]\nThe discriminant is positive, indicating that there are two distinct real roots.\nNext, we find the roots:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{49}}{2 \\cdot 6} = \\frac{-1 \\pm 7}{12}\n\\]\nCalculating the two roots:\n1.
