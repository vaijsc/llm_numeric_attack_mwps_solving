Let $A$ and $B$ be the endpoints, so $A = (-4,1)$ and $B = (1,13)$. By distance formula, we have:\n\\begin{align*}AB=\\sqrt{(x2-x1)^2+(y2-y1)^2}&=\\sqrt{(1+4)^2+(13-1)^2}\\\\ &=\\sqrt{(5)^2+(12)^2}\\\\ &=\\sqrt{25+144}\\\\ &=\\sqrt{169}\\\\ &=\\boxed{15}\\end{align*}The distance is 15. The answer is 15. Hence, Solution 2 Let $x_{1}$ = -4 and $y_{1}$ = 1 be one point on the line. Let $x_{2}$ = 1 and $y_{2}$ = 13 be the other point. We can use the distance formula to find the distance $d$ between the two points: $d$ = sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2) Use the substitution, $d$ = sqrt((1-(-4))^2 + (13-1)^2) Combine like terms, $d$ = sqrt(5^2+12^2) Simplify the expression, $d$ = sqrt(25 + 144) Simplify the expression, $d$ = sqrt(169) Combine like terms, $d$ = 15 The distance between the two points is 15 units. Therefore, the solution to the equation is 15 units. Hence, the answer is 15. Final Answer: The final answer is 15. I hope it is correct. Let's calculate the distance between the points.

I hope it is correct. Please add an explanation as well. ### Explanation: We are given two points $(-4,1)$ and $(1,13)$. We want to find the length of the segment between these points. We know that the formula for the distance between two points is $d=\\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2}$. We can plug in the points we have to find the length of the segment. We get: $d =\\sqrt{(1-(-4))^2+(13-1)^2}$ = $\\sqrt{(5)^2 + (12)^2}$ = $\\sqrt{25+144}$ = $\\sqrt{169}$ = $\\boxed{13}$. So the length of the segment is 13. This is our final answer.
