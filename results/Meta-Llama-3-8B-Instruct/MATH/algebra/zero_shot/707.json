Factoring is one method to solve quadratic equations, and there are many more methods to explore, such as the quadratic formula, completing the square, and the graphic method. \u2022 When solving quadratic equations, it is important to check the solutions by plugging the values back into the original equation. This will help ensure that we are not missing any solutions or finding extraneous solutions. \u2022 In this problem, we are asked to write the solutions in the form $x = a + bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers. This means we need to find the real and imaginary parts of the solutions separately. For example, if we find that the solution is $x = -4 + i0$, then in the problem, we would write $a = -4$ and $b = 0$.\u0159\u00ed\u017e.\ntags: #quadratic-equations #factoring #solving-equations #check-solutions #imaginary-numbers #real-numbers\nNote by AnnJeong\nYou can use Latex by wrapping your math problems in the LaTeX commands `\\begin{align*} ... \\end{align*}` and `\\begin{align} ... \\end{align}` or citing Latex for complex equations.

I hope it is correct.  Final Answer: The final answer is \\frac{1}{4}. I hope it is correct. 21 9 Before starting with the problem, we have to keep in mind that the discriminant of this equation is 9 which is positive, so the roots will be complex, that's why we can simplify the quadratic formula to get the expression in this form. That's the key difference between the problem and the earlier relevant problem solving textbook problems. Using the complex number form of the quadratic formula \\dfrac{-5 \\pm \\sqrt{5^{2} - 4(8)}}{2(1)}, we have \\dfrac{-5 \\pm \\sqrt{9}}{2}. This is the same as \\dfrac{-5 \\pm 3i}{2}. Since a = -\\frac{5}{2}, b = \\frac{3}{2}. Now we have a + b^2 = \\frac{-5}{2} + \\frac{9}{4}. Simplifying the equation gives us a + b^2 = \\frac{-5}{2} + \\frac{9}{4} = \\frac{-5}{2} + \\frac{45}{20} = \\frac{15 - 5}{20} = \\frac{10}{20} = \\frac{1}{2} which is the same as \\dfrac{1}{4}.

        " \n$x^2 + 5x + 8 = 0$\nWe can factor this quadratic:\n$(x+4)(x+2)=0$\nThis gives us $2$ possible solutions for $x$:\n$x=-4$ and $x=-2$\nNow, let\u2019s convert these solutions to the form $a+bi$.  We know that $x=-4$, so we can write:\n$-4=a+b(0)i$\n$a=-4$ and $b=0$.  So, $-4^2+0^2=-16$, which can be written as $a+b^2=-16$.\nWe also know that $x=-2$, so we can write:\n$-2=a+b(0)i$\n$a=-2$ and $b=0$.  So, $(-2)^2+0^2=4$, which can be written as $a+b^2=4$.\nThe problem asked for $a+b^2$, but it only gave us the answer as one of $-16$ or $4$.  We can realize that in general, $x=a+bi$ is a complex root, so we can write the solutions in the form $x=a+bi$.  In this case, both of the solutions have $b=0$, so $a+b^2$ is just $a$, the real part.  For the real number $-4$ we get:\n$a= -4$\nFor the real number $-2$ we get:\n$a=-2$\nTherefore, the sum of $a+b^2$ is $\\boxed{-2}.$\n#### Final Answer:\nThe final answer is -2. I hope it is correct.  Let me know if I need further clarification.  Thank you.  Good night.  Thank you for your attention. Have a good night.  Unless someone beats me to it, I will post the solution on Monday.  I hope things get more interesting tonight.  See you later.  I like food big time.  Don't ask.  Good night.  Bye for now.  I could solve like a million of these in one night...\n#### Solution 2:\nLet us convert it to the product form. Then, we would solve it by getting the signs on the real part and the imaginary part right. The final roots are -4 and -2. So, we would pick the signs correctly so the final answer is 4.",
        " We start by considering the general form of the quadratic equation:\nwhere $x$ is the unknown, and $a$, $b$ are the coefficients of the quadratic polynomial.\nWe are given a specific quadratic equation: $x^2+5x+8=0$\nWe can easily simplify this by subtracting $8$ from both sides, so we have:\nThe goal is to factor the remaining quadratic expression, we can try to find a factor of the form $(c + d x)$.\nTherefore:\nNow we know that $(x + 4)$ is a factor of the given quadratic equation. By polynomial division, we can see that $x + 4$ divides the given expression with remainder $-16$\nNow that we know $(x+4)$ is a factor, we can write the original equation as:\nLet\u2019s take that quadratic polynomial given by:\nFinally, we can write the general form of the solution to the quadratic equation as:\nSince we know $x^2 + 5x + 8 = 0$ can be written in the form $x = a + b i$ ,we can compare this with our general form of solution and see that\n$a = -2$ and $b^2 = 4-5^2 = 4 - 25 = -21$\nTherefore:\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -19. I hope it is correct. I am ready to help if you have any further questions. "
