Next, since all the fractions inside the expression are already reduced to simplest terms, we can do the fraction division on the right of the expression to obtain\\begin{align*}\\cfrac{\\cfrac{10}{8}}{\\frac{4}{5}}&=\\frac{10}{8}\\div\\frac{4}{5}\\\\&=\\frac{10}{8}\\cdot\\frac{5}{4}\\\\&=\\boxed{\\frac{25}{8}}.\\end{align*}\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\frac{25}{8}.
