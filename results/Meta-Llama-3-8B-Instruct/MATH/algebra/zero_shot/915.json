Substituting $y = 7 - x$ into $3x + y = 45$:\n$3x + 7 - x = 45$\n$2x = 38$\n$x = 19$\nNow we have $x = 19$. We can find $y$ by substituting $x = 19$ into $x + y = 7$:\n$19 + y = 7$\n$y = 7 - 19$\n$y = -12$\n$x^2 - y^2 = 19^2 - (-12)^2 = 361 - 144 = \\boxed{217}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 217. I hope it is correct.  You can double check it.  Let me run it through a simplification.  I just want to make sure.  So let\u2019s say we are given x+y = 7 and 3x+y = 45.  I have been considering something to make it easier, and we know that it is quite simple and we can just easily handle y.  We have an opportunity for substitute y with the first equation.  We can simplify y by simplifying y.  y = 7-x  If we substitute this in the 2nd equation, we will have 3x+7-x = 45  Simplifying all the terms gives 2x =",
