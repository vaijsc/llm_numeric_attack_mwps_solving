In this case, we have 24x^2 + 17x - 20 = 0, and we can factor it into (3x + 4)(8x \u2013 5) = 0. From there, we can easily find the roots as either 3x = -4 or 8x = 5, and they correspond to x = -4/3 and x = 5/8, respectively. The smallest value of x is therefore -4/3.

        " Since $24x^2 + 17x - 20$ is a quadratic equation, we can split the middle term into two parts. That is $24x^2 + 17x - 20 = 24x^2 + 17x - 17x - 20 = 24x^2 + 17x - 17x - 20 = 24x^2 + 16x - 20.$ Now, we must factor. We find two numbers whose product is $24 \\times -20 = -480$ are $24$ and $-20$. To get $16$, we need to average those two numbers, which is $(24 + -20)/2 = 4$. Those numbers are $4$ and $-12$. So, the quadratic equation becomes $(24x + 4)(x - 5) = 0$.$ Now, we can set the first factor equal to zero: $24x + 4 = 0$,$We can solve for $x$ and get $x = -\\frac{1}{6}$$.
