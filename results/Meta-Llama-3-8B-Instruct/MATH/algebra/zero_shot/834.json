You can master fractions in no time by getting started with this interactive math book.Fraction problems can be frustrating if you don't understand how to amend them. Good news is there are some tricks and tips that you can apply to solve fraction problems. Sometimes, it is good to simplify the numerator and denominator of a fraction to see if you can get rid of any common factors. Take this expression for example.\nWorking with fractions modulo 8.In the beginning, we can rewrite the fractions in terms of common denominator in the following manner:\nSuppose you have a unit fraction like 1/2. You can express it in terms of common denominator as 2/4 because both the numerator and denominator are divisible by 2. However, you may have noticed that both these fractions can be written in terms of the same common denominator, say 4. This is known as a least common denominator (LCD) of the two fractions: The fraction \\[\\frac{4+6a}{5}\\] can be rewritten as $\\frac{8+12a}{10}$. Now we can subtract the second fraction from this new fraction:\n$$\\frac{8+12a}{10}-\\frac{4+12a}{10}=\\frac{4+12a-4-12a}{10}=\\frac{0}{10}=\\boxed{0}$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 0",
