When we solve, we get:\n$x=\\dfrac{1\u00b1\\sqrt{5}}{2}$\nThe larger root is $\\dfrac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}$ which simplifies to:\n$\\psi=\\boxed{\\dfrac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 1+5+2=\\boxed{8}. I hope it is correct. 8\n",
        " The algebra solution\n$\\sqrt{x+1}=x$\nSquaring both the sides, we get\n$x+1=x^2$\n$x^2-x-1=0$\nUsing the quadratic formula, we get\n$x=\\dfrac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}$ or $x=\\dfrac{-1-\\sqrt{5}}{2}$\nThe first value is not greater than 1, whereas the second value is a valid solution. Thus, the largest value of $x$ is\n$x=\\dfrac{-1-\\sqrt{5}}{2}$\nThe required value of $a+b+c$ is\n$a+b+c=-1+5+2=\\boxed{6}$\n### "
