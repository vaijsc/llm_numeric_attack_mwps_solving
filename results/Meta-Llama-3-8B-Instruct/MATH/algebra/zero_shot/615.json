I hope this delightful math problem has been enjoyed by everyone. It is an interesting mathematical concept that is not typically found in everyday math homework. It's a chance for students to learn about complex numbers, while also exploring and solving mistakes. It is a valuable lesson in baseball math that is not usually seen in the classroom. Therefore, this challenge is not designed to cause failure, but to provide opportunity for students to learn. The purpose of this problem is to encourage and celebrate improvement, as in Dr. Palka's case. The problem solved is not an error. I hope that students have enjoyed this mathematical journey with O. Henry and Dr. Palka. Thank you for sharing this fun lesson with us. Enjoy your fun, messy mathematics bath. - The Avenger Team. wow! Go Avengers Go! Number real! Collider 2012",
        " Let\u2019s solve for a simpler case first.\nLet\u2019s say we want to solve $\\frac{a+bi}{x+yi}$ for some real numbers $a, b, x,$ and $y$.
