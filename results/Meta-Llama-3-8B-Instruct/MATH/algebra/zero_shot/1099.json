        "To solve the equation \n\\[\nx = \\frac{1}{2 + \\frac{1}{x - 2}},\n\\]\nlet's first simplify the right-hand side. We start by isolating the expression involving \\(x\\):\n1. Rewrite the equation:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{1}{2 + \\frac{1}{x - 2}}.\n   \\]\n2. Let's set \\(y = x - 2\\), hence, \\(x = y + 2\\). Substitute this in:\n   \\[\n   y + 2 = \\frac{1}{2 + \\frac{1}{y}}.\n   \\]\n3. Simplify the right-hand side:\n   Calculate \\(2 + \\frac{1}{y}\\):\n   \\[\n   2 + \\frac{1}{y} = \\frac{2y + 1}{y}.\n   \\]\n   Therefore, \n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{2 + \\frac{1}{y}} = \\frac{y}{2y + 1}.\n   \\]\n4. Substitute back in:\n   \\[\n   y + 2 = \\frac{y}{2y + 1}.\n   \\]\n5. Multiply both sides by \\(2y + 1\\) to eliminate the fraction:\n   \\[\n   (y + 2)(2y + 1) = y.\n   \\]\n   Expanding the left side:\n   \\[\n   2y^2 + y + 4y + 2 = y,\n   \\]\n   simplifies to \n   \\[\n   2y^2 + 5y + 2 = y.\n   \\]\n6. Rearranging gives:\n   \\[\n   2y^2 + 4y + 2 = 0,\n   \\]\n   or\n   \\[\n   y^2 + 2y + 1 = 0.\n   \\]\n7. Factoring the quadratic:\n   \\[\n   (y + 1)^2 = 0.\n   \\]\n   So, we get:\n   \\[\n   y + 1 = 0 \\implies y = -1.\n   \\]\n8.

Notice that \\(x = 1\\) does not satisfy the condition that \\(x > 2\\). \nLet\u2019s check for possible errors. Instead of the substitution, let's follow the initial equation's direct manipulations.\nReturning to \n\\[\nx = \\frac{1}{2 + \\frac{1}{x - 2}},\n\\]\n6.

        " begin\nThe first thing we do is to start by multiplying both sides of the given equation by $x-2$:\n$$x(x-2)=x-2+\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{x-2}}.$$In this step, we have used the property that $x\\div y=x''\\times y'$ and converted the fraction into the same denominator.\nOn the other side, we have this $1\\over \\frac{1}{x-2}$, this can be simplified as $(x-2)$ So we have\n$$x(x-2)=(x-2)+x-2 = 2x-2$$And then, to get rid of the $x$-term we subtract $x$ and add $2$ to both sides\n$$x(x-2)=2x-2$$\n$$x^2-2x=2x-2$$\n$$x^2-4x+2=0$$\nwhich can be rewritten as $$x^2-4x+2=x^2-2x-2x+2$$.  $x-2=(x-1)(x-2)$, so we have\n$$(x-1)(x-2)=0$$\n$x-1=0$ or $x-2=0$ \n$x=1$ or $x=2$ \nNow, x = 2 is not a solution to the given equation, so the positive solution must be $\\boxed{x=1}$.\n### ",
        " Let\u2019s define the expression inside the parentheses to be y: \\begin{align*}\ny=\\frac{1}{2+\\frac{1}{x-2}}\n\\end{align*}\nNow when we multiply both sides by y, we obtain\n\\begin{align*}\nxy=\\frac{y}{2+\\frac{1}{x-2}}\n\\end{align*}\nSo, we can simplify the right hand side of the above equation:\\begin{align*}\nxy&=\\frac{y}{2+\\frac{1}{x-2}}\\\\\n&=xy-2y\\frac{y}{2}\\\\\n&=xy-\\frac{y^2}{2}\\\\\n\\end{align*}\nSo, adding $\\frac{y^2}{2}$ to both sides of the equation, we have\n\\begin{align*}\nxy+\\frac{y^2}{2}&=y\\\\\nxy+\\frac{y^2}{2}y&=y\\\\\nxy(x+\\frac{1}{2})&=y\\\\\n\\end{align*}\nAt this step, we realize that y is undefined if $x = 2$. So, we can safely ignore this point. Now when we plug $x=2$ into the original equation, we find that $2 = \\frac{1}{2+ \\frac{1}{2-2}}$, but this is undefined.
