        " Since we know that $F(4, b, 2, 3) = 12$, we can think of what $a^b + c^d$ can equal 12.\n    - Since 4 raised to any even power is going to be a power of 4, it is safe to assume that $b \\neq 1$.\n    - Since $a^b + c^3$ is equal to 12, this means that there are no powers that will add up to 12. $2^3$ is 8, so that is a possible solution.\n    - However, we know that 4 is not equal to 2, so we need to divide by 8. This means that we need to divide $a^b$ by 8. The only way for $4^b$ to be a fraction is if $b$ equals $\\frac{1}{2}$, since the only even reciprocal of a whole number is 2.\n    - Now, we can plug in the values for c and d. c equals 2 and d equals 3. $a^b + 2^3$ is equal to 12, so $a^b$ must equal 10, since 12 minus 8 is 4. Finally, we can plug in $b$ equal to $\\frac{1}{2}$ for $a^b$ and we get $10$. Therefore, $b = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 1/2. I hope it is correct.

        " I have written a formula from a math problem that I need your help to solve. I have calculated the problem with three different values but I don't know which one is correct. Here is the formula: F(a,b,c,d) = a^b + c^d. Now I have been given the following information: F(4,b,2,3) = 12. I have calculated this for the following values of b: a = b = c = d = 2 a = 3 a = 4 a = 5 The corresponding values of F(4,b,2,3) are F (4,2,2,3) = 28 F (4,3,2,3) = 64 F (4,4,2,3) = 256 The problem problem is that I'm not sure which of these is the correct solution. I have tried different steps but I am not sure what to do. Please help me.\n### Informal-reply:\nI'd be happy to help you out. It seems like you are unsure which value of $b$ gives $F(4,b,2,3)=12$. Let's try to solve this step by step.\nSince $F(a,b,c,d) = a^b + c^d$, we have\n\\begin{align*}\nF(4,b,2,3)&=12\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 4^b+2^3 &=12\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 4^b+8 &=12\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 4^b&=12-8\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 4^b&=4\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad \\boxed{b=2}\n\\end{align*}\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2. I hope it is correct. I am relatively sure that 2 is the correct answer because a = 4, b = 2 has been considered from the start. When I changed a = 3, a = 4, a = 5, the output also varied and I made an error. 2 is confirmed. If there are any further questions, feel free to ask! I'll help. Thank you.",
