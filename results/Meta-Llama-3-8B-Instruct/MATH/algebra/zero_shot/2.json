We write $x$ as $n+\\dfrac{2}{7}$, where $n$ is the greatest integer less than $x.$ Then, $\\lceil x \\rceil = n + 1.$ Therefore, we can write $\\lceil x \\rceil + x$ as $n+1+n+\\dfrac{2}{7}=\\dfrac{23}{7}$.

If $n = 0$, then $$x = \\frac{23}{7} - n = \\frac{23}{7} > 1,$$ so we must have $n = 1$.

        " First, let\u2019s note that the floor function $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ is the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$, and the ceiling function $\\lceil x \\rceil$ is the least integer greater than or equal to $x$.\nGiven that $\\lceil x \\rceil + x = \\dfrac{23}{7}$, we can deduce that $x$ is between $0$ and $1$ inclusive, because $\\lceil x \\rceil > x$. Further, from $\\dfrac{1}{7} \\le x < 1$, we see that $x$ must be strictly less than $\\dfrac{3}{7}$. Next, consider the cases where $x$ is close to $0$ and $x$ is close to $\\dfrac{3}{7}$:\n\u2022 Case 1: $x > 0.5$\nWe can try $x = 0.5$. Then, $\\lceil x \\rceil = 1$, so $\\lceil x \\rceil + x = 1 + 0.5 = \\dfrac{3}{2} \\ne \\dfrac{23}{7}$. We can see that as $x$ increases, the value of $\\lceil x \\rceil + x$ will increase, so $x$ cannot be greater than $0.5$.\n\u2022 Case 2: $x < 0.5$\nLet\u2019s try $x = 0.4$. Then, $\\lceil x \\rceil = 1$, so $\\lceil x \\rceil + x = 1 + 0.4 = \\dfrac{5}{2} > \\dfrac{23}{7}$. We notice that the value of $\\lceil x \\rceil + x$ decreases as $x$ decreases. Therefore, it is impossible for $x$ to be strictly less than $0.5$.\n\u2022 Case 3: $x = 0.5$\nHowever, we have already checked this case and it doesn\u2019t work either, since $\\lceil x \\rceil + x = 1.5 \\ne \\dfrac{23}{7}$.\nTo summarize, we have tried all the possible values of $x$ close to $0$ and close to $\\dfrac{3}{7}$, but all of them fail. Therefore, $x$ has to be strictly between $0$ and $\\",
        " Step 1: By multiplying both sides of the equation by $7$, we obtain the equivalent equation $7x + \\lceil x \\rceil = \\dfrac{161}{7} = 23$.\nStep 2: The only integer that is exactly $3$ units away from $\\dfrac{161}{7}$ is $2$. Therefore, it must be true that $\\lceil x \\rceil = 2$, and subsequently $x < 2$.\nStep 3: Finally, we can find $x$ by testing values, e.g., $x = \\dfrac{1}{2}$ works, since $1 + \\dfrac{1}{2} = \\dfrac{3}{2} = 2$. Therefore, $\\boxed{x = \\dfrac{1}{2}}$.\n### Review: The technique used in the response is called a \"guess-and-check\" approach. In this approach, you test a few possible values until you find one that works. In this case, the possible values were small positive integers, since these are the closest values to $x$ that would make $\\lceil x \\rceil = 2$. A guess-and-check approach is often a facile way to handle problems involving the ceiling function, as it allows you to quickly find a possible value of $x$ and verify it works. Often, a guess-and-check approach can be combined with other algebraic manipulation techniques to find a solution. For example, we could have algebraically manipulated the equation in the original problem to obtain $7x = \\dfrac{23}{7} - 1 = \\dfrac{14}{7} = 2$, and then solved easily for $x$.\nLet\u2019s think step by step.\n### ",

To do this, let $n$ be that number, so we have$\\dfrac{23}{7} - x = n$Now, we must decide if this is an integer function.  If the integer function takes value $n$, then it takes on that value.

The remaining fraction becomes an infinitely long continued fraction $[a_1,a_2,a_3,...]$, but it can be approximated by approximately $[a_1] = 1.285714$.\nStep (vii) The infinite continued fraction can be approximated as 1.285714, and $\\frac{23}{7}$ = 3.285714. Now we can make an approximation, but we can find the exact value of $x$ by using a calculator. On calculator, an approximation of $x$ = $0.57142857$\nStep (viii) Write $x$ = $0.57142857$ as a common fraction. \\begin{align*} 0.57142857 &= 0.57142857 \\times 1/1\\\\ &= (57142857 \\times 1)/ (1000000000 \\times 1)\\\\ &= 57142857/1000000000\\\\ &= 575/1000 + 571/1000000 - 571/1000000000 \\end{align*} Then $x$ can be",
        " $x=\\frac{6}{7}$\nHere is the solution:\nIf $\\frac{23}{7}=\\lceil x \\rceil + x$, then $\\frac{23}{7}-x=\\lceil x \\rceil$, so $\\boxed{x=\\frac{6}{7}}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is x=\\frac{6}{7}. I hope it is correct. Dark blue edit: I typed answer first. Did I get it? -JGR I was hoping for some guidance or a solution to check out. But I'm pleased you wanted to provide your own solution. Here's how my approach would have been: $1.$ We want $\\lceil x \\rceil+x$ to equal the rational expression $\\frac{23}{7}$. $2.$ Let\u2019s get rid of the ceiling bracket using the ceiling property: $\\lceil x \\rceil \\le x + 1$, so we have $x+1 + x \\ge \\frac{23}{7}$, giving $2x+1 \\ge \\frac{23}{7}$. Then, subtract $2x+1$ from both sides: $2x+1-2x-1\\ge \\frac{23}{7} -2x-1$, which simplifies to $0 \\ge \\frac{16-23x}{7}$. So, $16-23x \\le 0$, or $23x \\ge 16$, and finally, $x \\ge \\frac{16}{23}$. Similarly, $x \\le 3$, so we can narrow $x$ down to a particular value by reciprocity, where $x+1 \\le x + 2$, which is equivalent to $x+1 \\le \\lceil x \\rceil$, giving $\\lceil x \\rceil = x+1$. Therefore, $\\frac{23}{7}=x+(x+1)\\rightarrow 2x+1=\\frac{23}{7}\\rightarrow 2x=\\frac{18}{7}\\rightarrow\\boxed{x=\\frac{6}{7}}$. For $x=\\frac{6}{7}$, $\\lceil x \\rceil = \\frac{8}{7}+\\frac{6}{7} = \\frac{14}{7} = 2$, so this value for $x$ satisfies $\\lceil x \\rceil+x=\\frac{12}{7}=\\frac{23}{7",
        " Step 1: Define and write equations.\nLet $n=\\lceil x \\rceil$, where $n$ is an integer. Note that $n\\ge x$, and so $n-1<x$. Hence, we can write \\begin{align*}\n\\lceil x \\rceil + x &= \\dfrac{23}{7} \\\\\nn + x &= \\dfrac{23}{7}.\n\\end{align*}\n### Step 2: Solve the inequality.\nWe know that $n$ is an integer, so we want $n\\le \\dfrac{23}{7}$. Note that $n$ must be an integer that is less than or equal to $\\dfrac{23}{7}\\approx 3.3$. So, we can try $n=3$ and see if $3+x=\\dfrac{23}{7}$ is satisfied. If $3+x=\\dfrac{23}{7}$, then $x=\\dfrac{23}{7}-3=\\dfrac{4}{7}$. This is a common fraction and so, we found our solution!\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\frac{4}{7}. I hope it is correct. $\\blacksquare$\n### Parting Note:\nTry this process with the problem: Find $x$ such that $\\lceil x \\rceil - x = \\dfrac{7}{13}$.

        " We can rewrite the given equation as:\nx+\\lceil x\\rceil=\\frac{23}{7}\nNow, if we denote $a = \\lceil x \\rceil$, we obtain the equation:\nx + a = \\frac{23}{7}\nWe know that $a$ is an integer and that $x + a = \\frac{23}{7}$ can be written as a fraction with a denominator of 7.  To do this, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 7:\n7x + 7a = 23\nSo, $a = 2$, since $23 modulo 7$ equals $2$.\nNow that we know $a = 2$, we can rewrite the original equation:\nx + 2 = \\frac{23}{7}\nSubtracting $2$ from both sides:\nx = \\frac{21}{7} = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{1}}\nFinal Answer: The final answer is x = \\frac{3}{1}.
