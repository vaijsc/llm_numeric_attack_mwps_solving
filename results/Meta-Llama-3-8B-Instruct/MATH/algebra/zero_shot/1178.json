        " (As you told the students)\nI know we can expand it step by step. One way to do it is to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):\n1. Multiply the two expressions inside each pair of parentheses:\n$$(x+3)(2x-4) = (x+3)(2x) - (x+3)(4) = 2x^2 + 6x - 4x - 12 = 2x^2 + 2x - 12$$\n$$\\text{and}\\qquad (x+3)(x-6) = (x+3)(x) - (x+3)(6) = x^2 + 3x - 6x - 18 = x^2 - 3x - 18$$\n2. Multiply these two expressions:\n$$(2x^2 + 2x - 12)(x-6) = 2x^3 - 12x + 2x^2 - 12x - 12x^2 + 72 = 2x^3 - 24x^2 - 24x + 72$$\nSo, the final answer is: $\\boxed{2x^3 - 24x^2 - 24x + 72}$.",
        " \nFirst, we have $(x+3)(2x-4)$.  Notice that we can factor the $x$ out of each term inside the parentheses to get $x(2x-4)+3(2x-4) = 2x^2 - 4x + 6x - 12$.  Simplifying, we get $2x^2 + 2x - 12$.  Now we can go back to the original expansion:  $(x+3)(2x-4)(x-6)$.  We were able to pair the first two terms $(x+3)$ and $(2x-4)$, so we can rewrite this as $(2x^2 + 2x - 12)(x-6)$.  Then factoring out the $x$ again, we get $2x^3 - 12x + 2x^2 - 12x - 72 = 2x^3 + 2x^2 - 24x - 72$.  That\u2019s our answer."
