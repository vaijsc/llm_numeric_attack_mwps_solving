        " First, let\u2019s calculate the total hours they both worked together.\n    - Since Alan worked three times as many hours as David, we can write an equation: David\u2019s hours = x, and Alan\u2019s hours = 3x, where x is the number of hours David worked.\n    - The total hours they both worked is the sum of Alan\u2019s hours and David\u2019s hours: Total hours = 3x + x, which is 4x.\n##  ### Now, let\u2019s calculate how many bricks they placed.\n    - Since Alan places 30 bricks per hour and David does the same, they placed a total of 30*3x + 30x bricks in 4x hours. To simplify this, we can combine the like terms: 60x bricks.\n## ### We know that their total bricks is 700. So, we can set up an equation:\n    - 60x = 700 |> Divide both sides by 60: x = 700 / 60 = 11.67 hours.",
        "Let\u2019s consider how many bricks Alan placed in the first step. He placed three times the number of bricks that David did, because David worked for fewer hours than Alan did. So, Alan worked for 3 x hours, for some number x. For instance, x hours is the number of hours David worked. Since Alan worked for ( x * 3 ) hours, which is the same number of hours he worked for, it might be thought of as x times 3. The number of bricks Alan places each hour is 30. So, to determine how many bricks he placed, you need to multiply the number of bricks he places each hour, which is 30, by the number of hours he worked each hour, which is x * 3. ( 30 ) * ( x * 3 ) = 30x3=90x bricks He worked for three times as many hours as David did, therefore David placed 30 bricks per hour and he worked for x hours. So, the number of bricks David placed is 30 * x. Let\u2019s put it all together now. Together, Alan and David placed a total of 700 bricks. To get the number of bricks David placed, subtract the number of bricks Alan placed from the total number of bricks ( 700 ). Now, how many bricks did David place? You have just discovered that David placed 30 * x bricks and Alan placed 90x bricks. 700 = 30 * x + 90x Simply add -30 * x to -90x and then shift 30 * x to the right. By doing this, you get 700 = 30x + 90x, which is the same as 700 = 120x. Divide both sides of the equation by 120 to find the value of x. The value of x is thus 700 / 120, which is equal to 5.75, but we cannot place a fraction of an hour. The value of x is, therefore, 5 hours. So, David worked for 5 hours, and since he placed 30 bricks per hour, he placed a total of 5 x 30 = 150 bricks \u2026 Final Answer: The final answer is 150. I hope it is correct. You can now check that 700 - 150 = 550 = 90x, which is true if x is indeed 5. ### Explanation: The given information begins by stating that the two bricklayers, Alan and David, each place 30",
        " \nLet x be the hours that David worked. Then Alan worked 3x hours. They placed a total of 700 bricks.\nSo, 30x + 30(3x) = 700.\nSimplify the equation:\n30x + 90x = 700\nSolve for x:\n120x = 700\nx = 700 / 120 = 5.83 (David worked around 5.83 hours).\nAlan worked 3 * 5.83 = 17.49 hours.\nNow, David placed 5.83 * 30 = 175.9 bricks. So, the answer is 175.9.\n### Outcome: \nDavid laid 175.9 bricks. She worked 5.83 hours.\nThis is a good problem that involves proportions and ratio. Students need to recognize that each bricklayer places 30 bricks per hour, so if they work a certain number of hours, they will place a certain number of bricks. The problem requires students to set up an equation and solve for the number of hours worked. Finally, students need to use the information to find the number of bricks laid by each bricklayer. This problem also encourages students to check their answer to ensure that it makes sense.",
        " \nThe two bricklayers place bricks at a rate of 30 bricks per hour, each. So if Alan worked 3 hours (total of 90 bricks each) and David worked x hours, then (30 \\* 3) + (30 \\* x) = 0\u00b07 , or 30 \\* 3 + 30 \\* x = 7 .

        " \nStep 1: Per hour,bricklayers: two per day,per day, Alan worked 3 * David, total 700 bricks\nStep 2: Calculate the total brick based on the day for each bricklayer. Bricklayer Alan placed 30 hours * 3 hours * 1 = 90 bricks. And David placed 30 hours * 1 hour * 1 = 30 bricks.\nStep 3: Calculate the bricks placed by David. Units of Brick (7100 bricks) - Units of Alan (90 bricks) = 6100 bricks\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 6100bricks. I hope it is correct. ",
        " Let x be the number of hours David worked. Then Alan worked 3x hours. We know that together they worked 30x + 30(3x) hours. The number of bricks they laid can be calculated like this: 30x + 30(3x) = 750. Simplify to get 90x = 750. Divide both sides by 90 and we get x = 8.3 hours.\nDavid worked for 8.3 hours and each hour he laid 30 bricks. So he laid 8.3 x 30 = 249 bricks.\nBut the problem asks how many bricks did David lay? The answer is 249 bricks. I hope it is correct. ###### Explanation: Let\u2019s start by assigning variables to the number of hours Alan and David worked. Let d be the number of hours David worked, so that the number of bricks David laid is 30d. Let a be the number of hours Alan worked, so that the number of bricks Alan laid is 30a. We know that the total number of bricks laid is 700, so we can set up the equation: 30d + 30a = 700. Since Alan worked 3 times as many hours as David, we know that a = 3d. Substitute this into the equation, so that: 30d + 30(3d) = 700. Simplify to get 90d = 700. Divide both sides by 90 to get d = 7.78 hours. So David worked 7.78 hours. Since he laid 30 bricks per hour, he laid 7.78 x 30 = 233.4 bricks. To two decimal places, the number of bricks David laid is 233.40. So, David laid 233.40 bricks. So the answer is 233.40 bricks.

        " \nLet's start by identifying the information we have:\n    - Alan's rate: 30 bricks per hour\n    - David's rate: 30 bricks per hour\n    - Alan worked three times as many hours as David: This means that if David worked x hours, Alan worked 3x hours.\n    - Total bricks placed: 700 bricks\nWe can start by finding the total number of hours worked by both Alan and David. Since Alan worked three times as many hours as David, we can set up an equation:\nAlan's hours = 3David's hours\nLet's say David's hours are x. Then, Alan's hours would be 3x.\nTotal hours = Alan's hours + David's hours\n= 3x + x\n= 4x\nNow we know that the total hours worked by both Alan and David is 4x. Since they placed a total of 700 bricks, we can set up another equation:\nTotal bricks = Alan's bricks + David's bricks\n= 30(3x) + 30x\n= 90x + 30x\n= 120x\nWe know that the total bricks placed is 700, so we can set up the equation:\n120x = 700\nTo find the value of x, we can divide both sides by 120:\nx = 700 / 120\n= 5.83 (approximately)\nSo, David worked approximately 5.83 hours. Now, we can find the number of bricks David laid by multiplying his rate by the hours he worked:\nDavid's bricks = 30 bricks/hour * 5.83 hours\n= 175.9 bricks (approximately)\nSo, David laid approximately 176 bricks. \ud83d\ude0a\n### 1\nWell done!

        " 100\n#### Analyze the question:\nThis problem is asking us to find the number of bricks that David laid. Since Alan worked three times as many hours as David, we can first find how many hours David worked, then multiply the number of bricks he lays per hour by the number of hours he lays bricks.\n#### Solve the problem:\nAlan and David lay bricks at a rate of 30 bricks per hour. So, Alan lays 30 bricks per hour, and David lays 30 bricks per hour. Let\u2019s assume David worked x hours. Then, Alan worked 3x hours. Since both Alan and David place a total of 700 bricks, we can write the equation:\n(30x) + (30 * 3x) = 700\nCombine like terms:\n60x + 90x = 700\nAdd the constants:\n150x = 700\nNow, divide both sides by 150:\nx = 700 / 150\nx = 4.67\nSince x cannot be a fraction of an hour, we round the number up to the nearest whole number of hours. David worked approximately 5 hours. Therefore, he laid:\n30 bricks/hour * 5 hours = 150 bricks",

If we let H be the number of hours David worked, then Alan worked 3 * H hours.\nTogether, they laid a total of 700 bricks. So, the total number of bricks they laid is equal to the number of bricks Alan laid plus the number of bricks David laid:\n(30 * (3 * H)) + (30 * H) = 700\nCombine like terms:\n90H + 30H = 700\n120H = 700\nNow divide both sides by 120:\nH = 5.83 (but we can\u2019t have a fraction of an hour, so we round it to 6 hours. If David worked 6 hours, then Alan worked 3 * 6 = 18 hours.)\nNow we can find the number of bricks David laid:\nNumber of bricks David laid = 30 * H = 30 * 6 = 180\nSo, David laid 180 bricks.

So, if we call the number of hours David worked x, the number of hours Alan worked is 3x. The total number of bricks placed is 700, and each hour, they both place 30 bricks. So the total number of bricks is the sum of the number of bricks placed by each: 30x + 30 * 3x. We set this equal to 700 and simplify: 60x = 700 60x/60 = 700/60 x = 11.7\n### ",
