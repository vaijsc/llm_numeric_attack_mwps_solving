        " Let the line be given by the equation $y = mx + b$. We are told that the line is parallel to the line $y = 4x + 6$, which means that the line $y = mx + b$ has the same slope as the line $y = 4x + 6$. The slope of the line $y = 4x + 6$ is 4. So, the line $y = mx + b$ has slope 4. We are also told that the line passes through $(7, 14)$. Therefore, the point $(7, 14)$ is on the line $y = mx + b$. This tells us that $14 = 7m + b$. We know that the line has slope 4, so we have\n$$\\begin{cases}m = 4\\\\14 = 7\\cdot4+b\\\\y = 4x + b\\end{cases}$$\nSolving the first equation we get $m=4$. Solving the second equation for $b$ we get $b=2$. Finally, the third equation gives $y=4x+2$.

A line parallel to $y=4x+6$ through $(7,14)$ is $\\boxed{2}$. We are told that the line is parallel to the line $y = 4x + 6$, which means that the line $y = mx + b$ has the same slope as the line $y = 4x + 6$. The slope of the line $y = 4x + 6$ is 4. So, the line $y = mx + b$ has slope 4. We are also told that the line passes through $(7, 14)$. Therefore, the point $(7, 14)$ is on the line $y = mx + b$. This tells us that $14 = 7m + b$.

        " \nI. Find the slope of the line.\nThe given equation $y = 4x + 6$ is in the slope-intercept form $y = mx + b$. From this, we see that the slope of this line is $m = 4$. (Note that we are not asked to find the $y$-intercept $b$.)\nII. Write the equation of the parallel line in the point-slope form.\nWe know that the line passes through $(7, 14)$ and has slope $4$. The equation is $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$. Substituting these values, we obtain\n$$y - 14 = 4(x - 7)$$ $$y - 14 = 4x - 28$$ $$y = 4x + 14$$\nIII. Write the equation of the parallel line in the slope-intercept form.\nSince the parallel line has the same slope as the original line, we know it also has a slope of $4$. Thus, the equation can be written as $y = mx + b$, and we know that $b = 14$ since the line passes through $(7, 14)$. Therefore, the equation is $y = 4x + 14$.\nIV. Find the point where the line crosses the $y$-axis.\nTo find the point where the line crosses the $y$-axis, we set $x = 0$ and solve for $y$. Plugging in, we obtain\n$$y = 4(0) + 14 = 14$$\nBecause $x = 0$ at the $y$-axis, we have found the $y$-coordinate. The point where the line crosses the $y$-axis has a $y$-coordinate of $\\boxed{14}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 14. I hope it is correct.-saleem12345\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 14.

        " To find a line parallel to a given line, we just need to pick a new $y$-intercept. Since the line $y=4x+6$ is already in the form $y=mx+b$ (slope-intercept form), we can compare coefficients to easily observe its slope is $4$ and its $y$-intercept is $6$. We are given a line parallel to this line also passes through $(7,14)$. So, we start by determining the slope using any two distinct points. In this case, we can choose the points $(7,14)$ and $(0,6)$ as $(7,14)$ is on our line and $(0,6)$ is the $y$-intercept. The slope between these points is\n$$m = \\frac{14-6}{7-0} = \\frac{8}{7},$$\nwhich is the same to the slope of the parallel line. Hence, its line equation can be expressed as $y= \\left(\\frac{8}{7}\\right) x + b$, where $b$ is the $y$-intercept. Since $(7, 14)$ satisfies this new line, we plug these values into the line equation to get\n$$14 = \\left(\\frac{8}{7}\\right)7 + b \\Rightarrow b = 14 - \\frac{56}{7} = \\frac{14}{7} = 2.$$\nFinally, the line equation of our parallel line is $y= \\frac{8}{7}x+2$. It crosses the $y$-axis at $x = 0$, so we can find the $y$-coordinate of this point to be\n$$y = \\frac{8}{7}\\cdot0 + 2 = \\boxed{2}.$$ Final Answer: The final answer is 2. I hope it is correct.

We miss matched how the title says the answer will be the $y$-coordinate across the $y$-axis. Final Answer: It's -14. I hope it is correct.  OR You could have directly converted $y = 4x + 6$ to the slope-intercept form: $y = mx + c$, here $m = 4$ and $c = 6$ and noticed that $m = 4$ and so the line passing through $(7, 14)$ will have the same slope. Therefore, the line will be $y = 4x + b$, for some $b$ and the point $(7, 14)$ will satisfy the equation. So, $14 = 4 \\cdot 7 + b$ and $b = -6$ and the line is $y = 4x - 6$. Now you can put $x = 0$ and get $y = -6$ as the $y$-coordinate. BUT how about we substitute the equation and see where it crosses the $y$-axis that is 0 is also answer .  \u2022 $y = 4x - 6$  \u2022 Plug in $x = 0$  \u2022 $y = 0 \\cdot 4 - 6$  \u2022 $y = -6$  \u2022 $0$ is $x$-coordinate  \u2022 Hence the answer is -6.

        " We know that to find the equation of a line through $(x_1,y_1)$ with slope $m$, we use the formula $y-y_1=m(x-x_1)$.

Then, for the line merely to cross the $y$-axis, we have that $x=0$, so $y=4(0)+6=6$.  Hence, the line crosses the $y$-axis at $(0,6)$.  So, the $y$-coordinate is $\\boxed{6}.$",
