        " The numbers are 17 and 35 since 17 + 35 = 52 and 17 * 35 = 35.\nTo find the new numbers we can just add them. 17 + 35 = 52.\nLet\u2019s think step by step.\n### Explanation: First we write the numbers as two variables. Let\u2019s call them A and B. Now, we have the expressions that state: the sum of the numbers is 52, so A + B = 52, and the product of the numbers is 35, so A * B = 35.\nWe are asked to find the positive difference between the numbers. This is |A \u2013 B|, the absolute value of A minus B.\nWe can start by substituting A and B in terms of 52 and 35 to the original expression that defines them. We have 52 = A + B and 35 = A * B.\nNow substitute B = 52 - A. So we have 35 = A * (52 - A). This means 35 = 52A - A^2, or 35 + A^2 = 52A.\nThis is a quadratic equation in A. We can solve it to obtain A = 17 and A = 35.\nNow we have B = 52 - 17 = 35 or B = 52 - 35 = 17.\nNow we can find the positive difference between the numbers:\nA = 17.\nB = 35.\n|A - B| = |17 - 35| = 18.\nThe difference is 18.",
        " If the sum of two numbers is 52 and their product is 35, then it's a classic combination problem. Here\u2019s how we can approach it:\n1. Let the numbers be x and y. We have x+y=52.

However, the problem asks for the positive difference between the numbers, not the difference between the digits. We can find the positive difference between the two numbers by taking the absolute value of their difference.\n|47 - 7| = |40| = 40\nSo, the positive difference between the numbers is 40. However, we need to find the positive difference between the original numbers, which are 7 and 45.\n|45 - 7| = |38| = 38\nSo, the positive difference between the numbers is 38.\nWait a minute! The correct answer is not 2, nor is it 38. Let\u2019s find the sum of the digits again.\nx + y = 52\n7 + 45 = 52\nNow, we know that the two numbers are 7 and 45. Let\u2019s find the positive difference between the numbers:\n|45 - 7| = |38| = 38\nOh no! It seems we got the same incorrect answer. Let\u2019s try again.\n|x - y| = 15\nSo, the positive difference between the numbers is 15. This time, the correct answer is 15. We can solve for x and y:\nx = 35 / y\nCite this as:\n(2021).

        " \nLet the two numbers be x and y. So the expression is:\nx + y = 52\nxy = 35\nNow, the question asks us to find the positive difference between x and y, which we can get using the expression:\n|x - y|\nNow, we can combine the two equations to get:\n(x - y) = 52 - 2xy / x + y\nSubstituting xy / (x + y) = 35 / 52 = 5/8, we get:\n(x - y) = 52 - 2 * (5/8) = 52 - 5 = 47 / 8\nSo, the positive difference between x and y is 47/8.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 47/8. I hope it is correct. "
