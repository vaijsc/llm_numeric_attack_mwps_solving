        " As the store is revenue driven, we need to maximize revenue. The store sells 120 - 4p books per month. The revenue the store earns is the price times the number of books sold, or p times (120 - 4p).  We can flatten the equation to p(120) - 4p^2.  As this is a parabola, you know that the maximum is the vertex.  Using vertex form, we can write our equation as p(120) - 4(p-60)^2 + 4*60^2.  Simplifying, we get -4(p-60)^2 + 7200.  Since we are maximizing revenue, we set the derivative equal to 0.  The derivative of this equation is -8(p-60).  Solving for p, we get p = 60.  If we plug p = 60 back into the original equation, we get p(120) - 4(60)^2 = 7200.  So, the price the store should charge is 60.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 60.

        " \nSince the number of books sold per month is 120-4p when the price is p dollars, we can rewrite the equation to be p(120-4p). \nWe want to maximize revenue, so we take the derivative of this equation with respect to p. $\\frac{d}{dp}(p(120-4p)) = 120-8p$. \nNow we set this equal to 0, which gives 120-8p=0. We can solve for p to get p=15.\nSo the price that the store should charge to maximize its revenue is 15 dollars.\n### Explanation: \nHere's how this answer got to the solution.\nAt first, we could not understand how to solve this problem. We thought we must use graphing, but we quickly realized that this problem can be easily solved by the method of extreme values. After the advice from instructor, we took the derivative of the equation p(120 - 4p), which is p*120-4p^2, and found where the derivative is equal to 0. This enabled us to find the price p that results in the maximum revenue. Finally, we substituted the value of p back to the function p(120-4p) to find the maximum revenue.\nThe crucial steps in solving this problem are being able to recognize that this is an extreme value problem and being able to derive the function correctly, which is p(120-4p). Once we derived the function, we were able to find the value of p that results in the maximum revenue. This problem taught us the importance of recognizing problem types and being able to derive functions correctly.",
        " \nThe store wants to maximize revenue. Since revenue is the product of price and quantity, the goal is to find the price which gives the highest revenue. Let\u2019s denote the revenue as R.\nSince the number of books sold is 120 - 4p, the quantity sold per month is 120 - 4p. The revenue is R = (price)(quantity) = p(120 - 4p).\nTo find the price which maximizes revenue, we need to determine the maximum value of R. Taking the derivative of R with respect to p and setting it equal to zero, we get:\ndR/dp = 120 - 8p = 0\nSolving for p, we get:\np = 15\nNow, let\u2019s check if this value of p gives a maximum, a minimum, or an inflection point by investigating the second derivative:\nd\u00b2R/dp\u00b2 = -8 < 0\nThis indicates that p = 15 gives a maximum. Therefore, the store should set the price at 15 dollars to maximize its revenue.\n### Type: Calculus  Practical Problems\n### Level: Medium(B2) 9th grade\n### Model Solution: D%D\n### Next Step: Go to the next question | Return to the Q&A list  Go back to question list\n### Authors: ",
        " If p is the price the store charges the customers, then 120 - 4p represents the number of books sold,\n      since this is what is given in the problem. Putting in what we know, this is equal to the equation: Revenue = 120 - 4p x p\nIn an earlier topic, it was discussed that the revenue function, r(p), is expressed by calculating the number of items being sold, or the quantity, q(p), and then multiplying that by the price. It is stated in the problem that q(p) is 120-4p. Now, we can calculate the revenue.\n```\nr(p) = (120-4p) x p\n```\nSimplifying, we get:\n```\nr(p) = 120p - 4p^2\n```\nTo find the price at which the revenue is maximum, we need to find the vertex of the revenue graph. If it is not clear, the vertex (also known as the turning point) of the graph occurs when the derivative r'(p) = 0.\n```\nr'(p) = 120 - 8p\n```\nThe vertex occurs at:\n```\nr'(p) = 0 => 120 - 8p = 0 => p = 15\n```\nSo, the price should be \\$15. This is the price at which the store should charge to maximize its revenue. Remember that the graph should be concave upwards for this to be the case. This graph is not shown in the answer. For this reason, it is better to do the second derivative, which, if it is positive, means that the function is concave upwards.\n```\nr''(p) = -8\n```\nr''(p) = -8 is negative, which means that the function (the revenue) is concave downwards. This is not what we want. We instead want a function that is concave upwards.\nSo, we are given that the function is a familiar one. There is a simpler method for finding when the function is concave upwards. A function has its minimum at the point where its first derivative equals 0. At that point, the function\u2019s second derivative is positive if the function is concave upwards and negative if it is concave downwards.\nLet\u2019s re-examine the revenue function we previously got:\n```\nr(p) = 120p - 4p^2\n```\nTo find when the function is maximum",
        " A simple way to solve this problem is to find the value of p that makes revenue negative. Then find the value of p that gives the highest revenue.\nLet\u2019s begin by writing an expression for the revenue, which is the number of books sold per month times the price of each book:\nRevenue = (120 - 4p) \\* p\nIn order to maximize revenue, we can find the value of p that makes the derivative of revenue with respect to p equal to 0.\nRevenue = 120p - 4p^2\ndRevenue/dp = 120 - 8p\nNow set dRevenue/dp = 0:\n120 - 8p = 0\n120 = 8p\np = 15\nBut this means that revenue will be negative. Which is not what we want. It doesn\u2019t make sense for the store to charge a price that would result in negative revenue.\nLet\u2019s check if p = 10 maximizes revenue:\ndRevenue/dp = 120 - 8p\nAt p = 10:\ndRevenue/dp = 120 - 80 = 40 > 0\nAt p = 11:\ndRevenue/dp = 120 - 88 = -32 < 0\nThis tells us that p = 10 is where the derivative changes from positive to negative, so it is where revenue is maximized.\nTo verify this, let\u2019s plug in p = 10 to Revenue:\nRevenue = (120 - 4(10)) * 10\nRevenue = 100\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 10.

        " \nRevenue per month = number of books sold per month * price per book = (120-4p)*p\nWe want to maximize revenue, so we need to make the revenue per month as big as possible. So we want to find the value of p that makes revenue a maximum.\nTo find the maximum of a quadratic function, we can take its derivative and set it equal to 0. The derivative of revenue per month is:\nd(R)/dp = d((120-4p)*p)/dp = -4p + 120\nAt the maximum, the derivative equals 0. So we can set it equal to 0 and solve for p:\n-4p + 120 = 0\n-4p = -120\np = 30\nSo p = 30 when the derivative equals 0. This means that the maximum revenue per month is obtained when the price per book is 30 dollars.",
        " To maximize revenue, we have to find the revenue equation and then differentiate it with respect to p to find the price that maximizes revenue.\nRevenue = p * (120 - 4p)\n### Explanation: \nWe start with the equation for revenue: revenue = price multiplied by the number of books sold. We know the relationship between the number of books sold and the price: the number of books sold is 120 - 4p. Putting it all together, revenue = p * (120 - 4p).\nNow, we differentiate revenue with respect to p to find the price that maximizes revenue:\nd( revenue )/d( p ) = p * d(120 - 4p)/d( p ) + (120 - 4p)\nThis simplifies to:\nd( revenue )/d( p ) = -4p + 120\nWe set this equal to zero to find the critical point (price that maximizes revenue).\n0 = -4p + 120\n### Why is this the critical point? A critical point is where the rate of change (derivative) is zero.\nSolving for p, we get:\np = 30\nSo, the price that maximizes revenue is $30.\n### Does this answer make sense? \nLet\u2019s plug p = 30 into the original equation for revenue:\nRevenue = 30 * (120 - 4 * 30) = 30 * 60 = 1800\nThe revenue is highest when the price is $30.",
        " First, we have to calculate the revenue when p books are sold:\nThe revenue is the price * the quantity sold, so the revenue is p * (120-4p). The revenue has to be in dollars per month, so we need a number with both dollars and months. Then, we can differentiate the revenue to solve the problem.\n### Reasoning behind: The store wants to maximize its revenue, which is the price * the quantity sold. The quantity is negatively related to the price because people buy less of something if it costs more. This problem is a generic example of the profit function in economics, which can be rearranged to a more easily differentiable quadratic equation.\n### Cont\u2019d: Let\u2019s continue to solve it!\nDifferentiate the revenue equation with respect to p to get: revenue'(p) = 120 - 8p First, we find the derivative by applying the power rule of differentiation, and then rewriting the equation accordingly.\n### Conclusion:\nNext, we set the revenue derivative equal to zero to find the price at which the store should sell to maximize its revenue: 0 = 120 - 8p Solve for p: 8p = 120 4p = 120/2 4p = 60 p = 60/4 p = 15 So, the store should charge \\boxed{\\15} to maximize its revenue given that the quantity sold per month is 120-4p.\n### Source: I read this multiple-choice question on a learning platform called Khan Academy, which is an open-source online learning platform.

        " The store is losing money by charging lower prices. It should charge a price that makes its revenue equivalent to 120 books.\n### Difficulty: Basic\n### Task Type: Problem Application\n### Topic: Algebra and Functions\n(Answer) We need to find the price at which the store should charge to maximize its revenue. We can do this by setting up and solving an equation based on the information provided. Revenue is measured by the number of books sold times the price of each book, which is $p.\nThe number of books sold, N, is given by the equation N = 120 \u2013 4p. To maximize revenue, the store should charge a price such that the profit from selling one book is equal to the cost of producing one book. This can be achieved by setting the number of books sold at 120, since that is the maximum number the store can sell at any given price.\nRearranging the equation N = 120 \u2013 4p to solve for p, we obtain:\np = 30 - (1/4)N\nSubstituting N = 120, we get:\np = 30 - (1/4)(120) = 30 - 30 = 0\nThis result is meaningless, but it tells us that the store should charge as much as possible to maximize its revenue. We can see this by simply considering the price and revenue without algebra. The store has a fixed cost per book, so it should charge as high a price as possible to maximize its revenue. Since there is no upper limit to the price it can charge, the store can set the price to whatever it wants and still maximize its revenue.",
        " Assuming the cost per book is zero for simplicity, the revenue equation is p multiplied by (120-4p). We can set it to maximize the revenue.\nIf we differentiate it, we get: d/dp(p(120-4p)) = 120 -8p.\n### New Part: Equate the derivative to zero and solve for p to find the optimization value.\n#### So, the optimization value of p will be (120/8) = 15.\nIf the price is less than 15 dollars, it means we are getting more books sold because the slope is positive.\nIf the price is more than 15 dollars, the store is losing money because the slope is negative.\nNow, the store will maximize its revenue if the price is 15 dollars. Well, we found the answer!\nSo, the store should charge 15 dollars per book. Can you believe it? Your answer is right. You are a revenue master! Go celebrate with a cup of coffee or that book you love purchasing (or not purchasing).#### ended\nTo get this to compile (without the line breaks).\n",
        " We can translate the sentence into a mathematical equation: $R = p(120 - 4p)$.\nThe revenue is the product of the price and the number of books sold.\n### "
