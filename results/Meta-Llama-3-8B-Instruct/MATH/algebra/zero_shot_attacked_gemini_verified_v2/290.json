We can however use the size $14$ root to get $2^x = \\frac{(8^x)^{1/14}}{8^{(x+1)/14}}.$\nIf we take the logarithm of base 8, we have $x \\log 2 = \\frac{\\log 8^x}{14} + \\frac{x \\log 8}{14}.$\nBut $8^x = 2^{7x}$ and $8 = 2^3$. So we have $x \\log 2 = \\frac{7x}{14 \\log 8} + \\frac{x \\log 2^3}{14}.$\nNotice that $\\log(2^3) = 3 \\log 2.$ So $\\frac{x \\log 2^3}{14} = \\frac{3x}{14} \\log 2.$\nNow $\\frac{\\log 2^2}{\\log 2} = 2$. So $\\frac{\\log 8}{\\log 2} = 2 \\cdot 2 = 4$ and $\\frac{7x}{14 \\log 8} = \\frac{x}{4 \\log 2}.$\nSo altogether we have\n\\begin{align*}\nx \\log 2 &= \\frac{x}{4 \\log 2} + \\frac{3x}{14} \\log 2 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad x \\log 2 &= \\frac{x}{4 \\log 2} + \\frac{3x}{14 \\log 2} \\log 2 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad",
        " We are to find $x$, such that $(2^{x+1})^3\\cdot 4^x = 8692$.\nSince $4^x = (2^2)^x = 2^{2x}$, this simplifies to $(2^{x+1})^3 \\cdot 2^{2x} = 8692$. Since the bases are all the same, we can equate their exponents: $(x+1)3 + 2x = 9$. Simplifying, we get $3x + 3 = 9$. Subtracting $3$ from both sides, we get $3x = 6$. Dividing both sides by $3$, we find that $x = \\boxed{2}$.\nThe answer is 2. I hope it is correct. ### Edit: There are multiple answers here. So, the correct answer is None. All answer choices are True.ington  But, the correct answer is actually 1, 2, or 3. The expression \"8692\" is not comprised of prime numbers or numbers that can be expressed in terms of prime numbers and exponents of 3, so any given number value will be equivalent to an answer choice of any of the given options. In fact, to test that hypothesis, let's try 1: $(2^{1+1})^3 \\cdot 4^1 = (2^2)^3 \\cdot 2^2 = 16 \\cdot 4 = 64 \\ne 8692$. Let's try 2: $(2^{2+1})^3 \\cdot 4^2 = (2^3)^3 \\cdot (2^2)^2 = 8^3 \\cdot 4^2 = 512 \\cdot 16 = 8192 \\ne 8692$. Let's try 3: $(2^{3+1})^3 \\cdot 4^3 = (2^4)^3 \\cdot (2^2)^3 = 16^3 \\cdot 8^3 = 4096^2 = 16777216 \\ne 8692$. Each time, we're far off. Therefore, we need some additional context as to what this expression represents, so we can determine the correct answer. Therefore, the correct answer is Whatever. #### Note. So, we found out that there are multiple answers here. That right, there are. Let's think back to"
