This is a value problem. The question is asking for the positive value of the expression and it will ask about the properties. The square root of $\\sqrt{125-8}$ is the positive value of the expression evaluated at the given values of $x, y$. It gives us an equation with the same variable which should be #solved either through substitution or elimination.  This equation can be solved by combining the given number 125 - 8 = 117. This finally provides the value which is a positive value in the expression.  #### 2. Key points to follow:   - You might not be asked about other operations.   The square root operation will probably require conversion of original expression values.   These inequalities like (integer, fraction) or other mathematical conversions should be considered familiar with their conversion when possible.
