        " 4^a = 32 , so a=2 . Let\u2019s now move to the second equation , a^b = 125 => 2^b = 5^3 => \\boxed{b=3 } . Lastly , b^a = \\boxed{3^2 = 9 }\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 9. I hope it is correct. 1/2/2021### ",
        " Hmm, great question!\nSo, the problem provides us with two equations. The first is $4^a = 32$, and the second is $a^b = 125$. We can solve both equations for now.\n### Solution (Step 1: Solve for $a$)\nThe first equation, $4^a = 32$, is asking us to find the value of $a$ such that $4$ to the power of $a$ equals 32. Since $4^2 = 16$ and $4^3 = 64$, we know that $4^1$ is not $32$, and $4^5$ is $1024$, which is much bigger than $32$. Therefore, we know that $2 < a < 3$. By testing some values, we get $4^3 = 64$ and $4^4 = 256$, which is still too big. We eventually find that $4^2 = 16$ and $4^3 = 64$. Since $32 = 2 \\cdot 16$ lies between $16$ and $64$, we know that $a = 2 + r$ for some positive integer $r$. The next step to solve this equation would be to write it as $2^{\\log_24^a} = 2^{\\log22\\cdot\\log22+1}$. This will allow us to simplify the expression further, setting us up for a solution.\n### Solution (Step 3: Find $b$)\nThe second equation is $a^b = 125$. We know that $a = 2 + r$ for some positive integer $r$. Next, we can use this information to find $b$, by writing $a^b = 5^3$.\n### Solution (Step 2: Find $r$)\n### Solution (Step 4: Solve for $b$)\n### Solution (Step 5: Find $b$)\nWe can see that $r = 1$, which implies $a = 2 + 1 = 3$. Therefore, $b = \\log_53 = \\boxed{3}$, since $125 = 5^3$. To find $\\boxed{b^a}$, we multiply $b^a$ by $a^b$. The result is $\\boxed{125}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 125. I hope it is correct. ### "
