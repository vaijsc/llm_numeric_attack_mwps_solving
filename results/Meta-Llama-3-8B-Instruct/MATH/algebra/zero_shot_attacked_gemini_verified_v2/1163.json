It is the case when x+3 gives a non-positive number. But then we know that G(a) = 4-3a. And it can be seen that G(a) as non-positive when 4-3a \\le 0 \\Rightarrow a \\ge 4/3. So the biggest constant we can have $a=4/3$, then since G(4/3) is not defined, $a<4/3$. Then $a=1$ results in a valid $P(G(1))$.\n#### (this is not a proof, only an idea about how to do it)\nNote by auscomp1777\nFinal Answer: The final answer is a=1. I hope it is correct.",
        " We need to find the maximum value of $a$ to make $P(G(x))$ defined and output a real number.\n1. Suppose our $a$ goes nicely into $(x+3)$ and divides it evenly.\n2. So, we can have $x+3 = a^2$ = some real number; hence, we have $x = a^2 - 3$.\n3. Now plug $G(x)$ into $P(G(x)) = 4+2\\sqrt{G(x)+3} = 4 + 2\\sqrt{(4-3x)+3}$.\n4. then we have $P(G(x)) = 4+2\\sqrt{7-3x}$.\n5. Because we know that $P(G(x)) = 4+2\\sqrt{7-3x} = 4+2\\sqrt{-a^2 +7} = 4+2i\\sqrt{(a^2)-7}$ and $4+i\\sqrt{(a^2)-7}$.\n6. When $a^2$ is greater than 7, for example $a\\geq3$, then we have $4+2\\sqrt{(a^2)}$ with $a^2 > 7$ is an undefined number.\n7. If we go backwards in reverse to solve for the maximum, we can clearly see that if $a \\geq$ certain number, $a \\geq$ 3, then $P(G(a))$ is undefined. So, the maximum number is 3.\nFinal Answer: Hence, the greatest constant $a$ satisfying the given criteria is $a = \\boxed{3}$, since any larger value of $a$ would result in undefined values. Check: At $a = 3$, the square root is only defined.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is a = 3. I hope it is correct.",
        " Note that $G(a) = 4-3a$ and therefore $P(G(a)) = P(4-3a)$. So, $P(G(a))$ is defined when $4-3a+3 \\ge 0$, or $a \\le \\frac{7}{3}$. The maximum constant $a$ satisfying this condition is $\\boxed{\\frac{7}{3}}$.\n#### Reese\nThe constant $a$ that makes $P(G(a))$ defined is when $4-3a+3$ is greater than or equal to 0. So we solve $4-3a+3 \\ge 0$, and we get $a\\le\\frac{7}{3}$. Thus, the largest value of $a$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{7}{3}}$.\n#### Marge\nIn order for $P(G(a))$ to be defined, we need $\\sqrt{4-3a+3} = \\sqrt{x+3}$ to have real value, so we need $4-3a+3 \\ge 0$, and this is only true for $a \\le \\frac{7}{3}$. Therefore, the largest value of $a$ such that $P(G(a))$ is defined is $\\boxed{\\frac{7}{3}}$. Alternatively, we could observe that \\begin{align*} P(G(a)) &= 4+2\\sqrt{4-3a+3} \\\\ &= 4+2\\sqrt{4-3a+3}\\cdot\\frac{\\sqrt{4-3a+3}}{\\sqrt{4-3a+3}} \\\\ &= 4+2\\sqrt{\\left(\\sqrt{4-3a+3}\\right)^2} = 4 + 2(4-3a+3) = 4 + 8 - 6a. \\end{align*} The terms in this expression are all real only if $4-3a+3 \\ge 0$, which again gives $a \\le \\frac{7}{3}$. Therefore, the largest value of $a$ such that $P(G(a))$ is defined is again $\\boxed{\\frac{7}{3}}$.\n#### Christine\nWe want $\\sqrt{x+3}$ in $P(x)$ to have a real value, which implies that $x+3\\ge0$. This becomes $4-3a+",
        " If $P(x) = 4+2\\sqrt{x+3}$ and $G(x) = 4-3x$, then what is the largest constant $a$ such that $P(G(a))$ is defined?\nThe original problem statement is exactly the same, but the description is more detailed.\nIf we first find $G(a)$ by substituting $a$ into $G(x) = 4-3x$, we have\n$$G(a) = 4-3a$$\nSubstituting this expression into $P(x)$, we have\n$$P(G(a)) = P(4-3a) = 4+2\\sqrt{(4-3a)+3}$$\nNow, to find $a$ such that $P(G(a))$ is defined, we have to look at when the argument under the square root sign is non-negative.
