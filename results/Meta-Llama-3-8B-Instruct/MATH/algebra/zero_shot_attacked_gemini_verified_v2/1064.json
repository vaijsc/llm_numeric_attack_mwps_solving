        " Let x be the lowest integer in the set. The five consecutive integers can be written as x, x + 1, x + 2, x + 3, x + 4.

To find the same, we can replace x by 2 and find the new sum:\n2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 20\nThis is close, but less than 22.

        " The easiest way to approach this problem is to first set up the original set of integers. Since it has a sum of 22, then the set may be $\\{x, x+1, x+2, x+3, x+4\\}$ for some $x$.

        " \nLet\u2019s find the set of five consecutive integers first.  We know that the sum of a set of five integers is 22.  Let\u2019s call the middle integer x, then the sum of the set is:\nx - 2 + x - 1 + x + x + 1 + x + 2 = 22\nCombine like terms:\n5x = 22\nDivide by 5:\nx = 4.4\nSince x must be an integer, we round down to the nearest integer.  In this case, x = 4.\nSince x = 4, the five consecutive integers are 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.\nNow, let\u2019s increase each integer by 2 and multiply by 20.  The new set of integers is:\n20(3 + 2) = 80\n20(4 + 2) = 100\n20(5 + 2) = 120\n20(6 + 2) = 140\n20(7 + 2) = 160\nThe sum of the new set of integers is:\n80 + 100 + 120 + 140 + 160 = 600",

However, we can get closer to the solution by determining the smallest set of consecutive integers whose sum is closest to 22. We can do this by guessing and checking.\nLet\u2019s try x = 2:\n2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 20, which is too small. Let\u2019s try x = 3:\n3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 25, which is too large.

Each integer of the set is then increased by 2, and the resulting set becomes:\n5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 35\nThe integers are then multiplied by 20 to become:\n100, 120, 140, 160, 180\nThe sum of these integers is:\n100 + 120 + 140 + 160 + 180 = 700\n### Therefore, the sum of the new set of integers is 700.  Final Answer: The final answer is 700. I hope it is correct.  This is called \"guess and check\", a common technique in algebra.  You guess a value, check if it is correct, and then modify the guess if it is not.  Here, we guessed values of x and checked if the corresponding sum was 22.

        " \nThe first thing to do is to figure out what the five consecutive integers are. You can think of it like a secret message. Their sum is 22. Let\u2019s start with an easy one. \nSuppose the five numbers are 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8. \nTheir sum is 30, not 22. So that\u2019s not it.\nLet\u2019s try another one. \nSuppose the five numbers are 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. \nTheir sum is 25, not 22. So that\u2019s not it.\nLet\u2019s try one more. \nSuppose the five numbers are 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. \nTheir sum is 20, not 22. But we can add two to get the next set of five numbers: \n4, 5, 6, 7 and 8. \nTheir sum is 30.\nNow we need to increase each number by 2. \n4 + 2 = 6, 5 + 2 = 7, 6 + 2 = 8, 7 + 2 = 9, 8 + 2 = 10. \nSo the numbers are 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10.\nNow multiply each number by 20. \n6 x 20 = 120, 7 x 20 = 140, 8 x 20 = 160, 9 x 20 = 180, 10 x 20 = 200. \nThe sum of the new set of numbers is \n120 + 140 + 160 + 180 + 200.\nWhich is \n800. \nHence the answer is 800.\n### Solution Summary:\n1. Identify the initial set of five consecutive integers with a sum of 22.\n2. Determine the set of five consecutive integers by trial and error.\n   * The initial set is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n3. Increase each number by 2 to get a new set of integers: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.\n4. Multiply each number by 20 to get a new set of integers: 6 x 20 = 120, 7 x 20 = 140, 8 x 20 = 160, 9 x 20 = 180, 10 x 20",
        " \nLet $x$ be the smallest integer in the set.  We are given that\nx+x+1+x+2+x+3+x+4 = 22,\nso\n5x+10 = 22, \nand \nx = 4. \nTherefore, the set of integers is {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}.  \nIf we increase each integer in the set by 2 and then multiply each integer in the set by 20, we have \n{20(4+2), 20(5+2), 20(6+2), 20(7+2), 20(8+2)} \n= {120, 140, 160, 180, 200}\nand the sum of this set of integers is\n120+140+160+180+200=\\boxed{800}\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 800. I hope it is correct. istringstream\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 800. I hope it is correct.",
        " \n#### 1. Find the set of five consecutive integers that sums up to 22:\nWe are given that a set of five consecutive integers sums up to 22. So, we can write:\na + (a+1) + (a+2) + (a+3) + (a+4) = 22\nCombine like terms:\n5a + 10 = 22\nSubtract 10 from both sides:\n5a = 12\nDivide by 5:\na = 2\nSo, the set of five consecutive integers that sums up to 22 is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}."
