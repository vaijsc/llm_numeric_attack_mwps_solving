I hope it is correct.  ### Final Answer: The final answer is 1. I hope it is correct.  #### I hope this is correct. HEy guys, this is your mathematics enthusiast,  and welcome back. In this video, I'm gonna solve this problem, which is a solution set and number theory problem, and it is all about powers of bases. Let's dive in. The problem statement is this: 57 to 36n equals 81 to 48. We have to find n. So, if you look at the problem statement, you see we have two bases, one is 57 and the other base is 81. And their exponents are 36n and 48 respectively. When dealing with powers, especially when we have to solve a problem like this, we have to use a very important concept, which is equality of the exponents. Equality of exponents means that even though we have different bases and different exponents, we can only write the problem this way: 36n equals 48. So, now we're left with a very simple problem, which is just dividing 48 by 36. If we divide 48 by 36, we get 1.33... but in the context of math, we usually write this as 1.3 or simply 1. So, n equals 1. That's it. That's the answer we get when we divide 48 by 36. So, the final answer is n equals 1. And that's how we solve the problem. That's it for this video. I hope you learned something new, something interesting, and something fun. Thanks for watching, and don't forget to subscribe. In my next video, I'll be solving another math problem.

        " Let\u2019s take base 3.  The base-3 representation of $57$ is $2021_3$, so in this case, we are saying that $2021_3^{36n}=1000_3^{48}$.  One idea would be to rewrite this as $$(2+2+1)^{36n}=(1+0+0)^{48}.$$Now, all we have to do is rewrite this in a way where we do not have the same bases\u2013notice, we can rewrite $2+2+1$ and $1+0+0$ as $k3+3+1=4k$, where $k=3$.  So, we can rewrite it as $$(4k)^{36n}=1^{48},$$where $k=3$.

Once we know what that is, we can just put it into an algebra equation to solve for $n$.\n### Solution: This question is actually asking us to solve a logarithmic equation.\nFrom the given equation, we can get $$\\frac{\\log(57^{36n})}{\\log(57)}=\\frac{\\log(81^{48})}{\\log(81)}.$$Now, as $\\log(a^b)=b\\log(a)$, we can simplify this to $$36n\\log(57)=48\\log(81).$$Recalling that $\\log(a)=\\frac{\\ln(a)}{\\ln(10)}$, we have $$36n\\log(57)=48\\log(81)\\Rightarrow 36n\\frac{\\ln(57)}{\\ln(10)}=48\\frac{\\ln(81)}{\\ln(10)}.$$Now, separating variables gives $$\\frac{\\ln(57)}{48}=\\frac{\\ln(81)}{36n}.$$To solve for $n$, we can use substitution or elimination, where we neglect the logarithms and set $x=\\frac{1}{36n}$, or $x=\\frac{48}{\\ln(81)}$.  To solve for $n$ using elimination, we can write $$\\",
        " \nFirst, simplify the equation. Convert both sides into their prime factor forms.\n$$\\underbrace{3^3\\cdot19}_{=57}^{36n}=\\underbrace{3^4\\cdot3}_{=81}^{48}$$\nBoth equations will have some power of 3 and 19 on the left and 3 on the right, so you can reduce the power without changing the value.\n$$\\underbrace{(3^{3-1})^{36n}5^{36n}}_3=\\underbrace{(3^{3-2})^{48}}_1\\cdotunker(3^{3-1})^{48} _3$$\nFrom what we obtained, $3^{3-1}=3^2$, so substitute that in.\n$$\\underbrace{(3^2)^{36n}}_3=\\underbrace{(3^2)^{48}}_1\\cdot(3)^{48} _3$$\nWith different powers of 3 ^ 2, they can still have equal values if the powers have the same ratio, since 3 ^ 2 will have the same power on both sides of the equation.\nFor example, 36n = 48. BMA.42 \u2018There are many different ways to get the same power of 3 base2, but they can be used to get the power ratio equal to\n$$30n=48 \\rightarrow n = 48 \\div 30 = 16$$"
