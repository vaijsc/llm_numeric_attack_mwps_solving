The ratio tells us that for every 5 units of height, there are 4 units of shadow. We can set up a proportion:\n    height : shadow = 5 : 4\n3.

First, let\u2019s calculate the ratio of Monica to her shadow.\nMonica is 5 feet tall. Her shadow is 4 feet long. So the ratio is 5/4. Next, let\u2019s do the same for the pine tree. The pine tree casts a shadow 34 feet long. So, the ratio of the pine tree\u2019s height to its shadow is height/34.\nEquating these ratios, we get:\n5/4 = height/34\nNow, multiply both sides by 34 to eliminate the fraction:\n5*34 = height*4\nNext, we simplify the left side:\n170 = height*4\nLastly, we divide both sides by 4 to find the height:\n170/4 = height\n170/4 = 42.5\nThe height of the pine tree is approximately 42.5 feet.\nSo, the pine tree is approximately 42.5 feet tall.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 42.5.

        " To find the height of the pine tree, first we must find the height of Monica. We know Monica is 5 feet tall, so her shadow to height ratio is 4/5.\n### Next we use the ration to solve for the height of the pine tree.\n### We use a variable like h for the height of the pine tree and put 34/h for the ratio of the pine tree\u2019s shadow to its height. We set the ratio of the pine tree\u2019s shadow to its height equal to the ratio of Monica\u2019s shadow to her height.\n### The equation becomes 4/5 = 34/h and we are solving for h.\n### To solve for h, we can multiply both sides by h which gives us 4 = (34)/5. This simplifies to 4 = 6.8 and dividing both sides by 4 yields h = 1.7 or 1.7 feet tall.\n### That makes no sense, so let\u2019s use the proportion method. Set up a proportion with the two ratios.\n### 4/5 = 34/x. Cross multiply and get 5x = 4*34, or 5x = 136. Divide both sides by 5 to get x = 27.2.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 27.2 feet. I hope it is correct.",
        " We\u2019ll use proportions to solve this. We can say $ (5 / 34) = (x / 4) $ where x is the height of the pine tree. To solve for x, we multiply 5 by 4 on both sides of the equation, and then divide both sides by 34:\n### $x = (5 \\times 4) / 34 = 20 / 34 = 10 / 17 \\approx 5.88$ So the pine tree is approximately 5.88 feet tall.\nI hope it is correct.ijkstraalgorithms.org",
        " \nLet's use a proportion to set up an equation.\nLet's say the height of Monica is h and the height of the pine tree is p. Then,\n```\nh/p = 4/34\n```\nThe height of Monica is 5, so we can substitute 5 for h in the equation:\n```\n5/p = 4/34\nMultiply both sides by p:\n5 = (4/34) * p\nMultiply both sides by 34 to get rid of the fraction:\n170 = 4p\nDivide both sides by 4:\n85 = p\nSo, the pine tree is 85 feet tall.\n````\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 85.

        " Monica\u2019s shadow is 4 feet long and the pine tree casts a shadow of 34 feet long. This means that for every 5 of Monica, the pine tree has 34 length. So, to get the height of the pine tree, we need to divide the height of the pine tree by 5 and then multiply it by 34.\nNow, let\u2019s try setting up a proportion.\n### Note: \nWe know that Monica is 5 feet tall, and her shadow is 4 feet long. So let\u2019s set up a proportion:\nSo, the height of the pine tree divided by its shadow length is equal to 5 divided by 4.",
        " Let\u2019s first make a rough sketch of the situation and name the various lengths. (see below)\nFrom our sketch, we conclude that the pine tree is the third tallest object, so we can represent its height by $h$ . Then, the sun, the pine tree, and Monica\u2019s shadow form similar triangles, so we can write $$\\frac{h}{34}=\\frac{5}{4}.$$ From this equation, we can compute $h$ to be $h = \\boxed{17.5}$ . So, the pine tree is 17.5 feet tall.",
        " We know that when the pine tree casts a shadow of 34 feet, Monica\u2019s shadow must have the same proportion, 4:34 = x:34, where x is Monica\u2019s shadow. Playing with proportions (which is called cross multiplication here):\n(4)(34) = (x)(34) 136=34x\nNow we need to solve for x:\nx= 136/34\n### Final Answer: The final answer is 4. I hope it is correct.UpDown\n## SOLUTION\nMonica's shadow is 4 feet long and the pine tree's shadow is 34 feet long. Since Monica is 5 feet tall, the ratio of her height to her shadow length is 5:4. The ratio of the tree's height to its shadow length must be the same, so the tree's height must also be in the same ratio to its shadow length.\nLet x be the tree's height. Then, the ratio of the tree's height to its shadow length is x:34, and the ratio of Monica's height to her shadow length is 5:4.\nWe know that these two ratios are equal, so we can set them equal to each other:\nx:34 = 5:4\nTo solve for x, we can cross-multiply:\nx \u00d7 4 = 5 \u00d7 34\nx = 136/34\nx = 4\nSo, the tree's height is 4 feet tall.UpDown\n## SOLUTION\nThe pine tree casts a shadow of 34 feet. Monica, who is 5 feet tall, casts a shadow of 4 feet. Let\u2019s draw a diagram to get the idea of the situation.\nThe pine tree\u2019s height is x. Since the proportion of the pine tree\u2019s height to its shadow is the same as Monica\u2019s height to her shadow, we have the following equations:\nx/34 = 5/4\nFirst, we can cross multiply the above equation:\nx \u00d7 4 = 5 \u00d7 34\nNow, solve for x:\nx = 136/34\nx = 4\nSo the height of the pine tree is 4 feet.",
        " We start with Monica\u2019s height and shadow. Her height is 5 feet and her shadow is 4 feet.\n### ",
        " I know that the height of Monica (5 feet) and the length of her shadow (4 feet) together form a similar proportion to the height of the pine tree and the length of the pine tree\u2019s shadow (xx).\n### If we use these lengths to create a proportion, we can write it like this:\n$\\frac{5}{4} = \\frac{x}{34}$.

That's good enough to ensure that the pine tree on the left is the correct answer. Now, let's work backward to find the height.
