Let\u2019s look closer:\nWe have $\\frac{|9+2a|}{1}<25$. The $1 can be taken out, this is ok because it does not change the function:\n$|9+2a|<25$ Now the goal is isolate $9+2a$ and keep the absolute value on only $9+2a$.\nLet\u2019s manipulate it. We know:\n\u2013 $9+2a=pos$ -> $|9+2a|=p$\n\u2013 $9+2a<0$ -> $|9+2a|= -p$ So:\n$9+2a=pos \\wedge |9+2a|=p \\rightarrow 0<p<25 \\rightarrow p \\in (0,25)$\n$9+2a<0 \\wedge |9+2a|=-p \\rightarrow -25<p<0 \\rightarrow p \\in (-25,0)$\nWe now can keep $|9+2a|=p$: $p<25$ It\u2019s time to put it back.
