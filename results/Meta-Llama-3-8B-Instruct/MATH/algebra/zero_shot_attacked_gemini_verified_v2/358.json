Let me know if you have any question or need more clarification. )aks/me).  )aks/condensoleyen.  )aks/kaushikshivaram.  )aks/agatax.  )aks/123321.\nIt was an interesting problem. Many people who solved this problem were Quick and easy. Just simplify the problem, and solve for $x$. So, this problem may not be useful for checking quickness. It was just a small exercise. The solution process is not complex so that any one can solve it even without any programming or coding. That's why, it will not be useful for checking quickness. But, it is still a good problem for checking any program or script or code that solves linear equations. Because, the program can be tested with this simple example. This example is slightly more complex than the other examples. So, it can be a good checking point.\nBut, I think that there is one more test. We have another problem. It is as follows.\n$$ \\frac{2x+5}{x+3}=12 $$\nWe can solve this problem easily. We have to follow the same steps as above. So, we will get\n$$ x = \\frac{27}{5} $$\nThis problem is more complex than the previous problem. So, it can be a good test point. Because, some programs or codes may not be able to solve this problem easily. So, we can test them with this problem.\nThat's my idea. I think that these two problems can be used to test any program or code that solves linear equations.\nPlease, give me your thoughts. Do you think that these problems are good for testing programs? Or do you have other suggestions for testing programs? Thank you.  Everton Silva\nwont let me post )aks/agatax",
        " We have $$\\frac{9-4x}{x+6}=9.$$ The idea here is to get all $x$\u2019s on one side, so we get $$\\frac{9-4x}{x+6}-9=0.$$ Next, we simplify it to $$\\frac{9-4x-9(x+6)}{x+6}=0$$ $$\\frac{-4x-9}{x+6}=0.$$ Finally, we get $$\\frac{-4x-9}{x+6}=0 \\Rightarrow -4x-9=0.$$ Multiplying both sides by $-1$ and rearranging terms, we have $$4x=9\\Rightarrow x=\\frac{9}{4}.$$ We can easily check whether this $x$ solves the equation by substituting $x=\\frac{9}{4}$ in $\\frac{9-4x}{x+6}=9$.

The student wrote the answer as $x = -\\frac{15}{1}$, but in the end, I chose to write the answer as $x = -15$.  This is because $-15$ is the simplest way to express the answer.  It might also be worth noting that the student is correct to write their answer as $x = -\\frac{15}{1}$, and this is a completely valid representation of the solution.  I just choose to write the answer in a simpler form.  It's also worth noting that the student might also choose to write the answer as $x = -3$, but this would be wrong.  $-3$ is not the solution to this problem.  It would require an incorrect step in the solution process.  But I digress.  The answer is correct, and that's what matters.  Both representations of the answer, $x = -\\frac{15}{1}$ and $x = -15$, are acceptable.  But the answer $-3$ is incorrect.
