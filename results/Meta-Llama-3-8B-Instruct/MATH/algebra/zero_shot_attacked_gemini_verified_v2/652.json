        " \nLet\u2019s consider a specific example first: the parabola with equation $y=x^2$ and vertex at the origin. When we reflect this over the line $y=0$, our equation becomes $y=-x^2$. So in this case, $d=-a, e=-b, f=-c$.\n### Extension:\nThe general rule is that when you reflect a parabola over the line $y=k$, you multiply the sum of the coefficients of the $x$ effect terms by -1, and leave the constant term alone.\n### Conclusion:\nFor our parabola with equation $y=ax^2+bx+c$ and vertex $(h,k)$, the reflected parabola has equation $y=-a(x-2h)^2+b(x-2h)+k$. In terms of $k$, we can re-write this as $y=-a(x^2-4hx+4h^2)+bx-2bh+k$, which simplifies to $y=-ax^2+4ahx+4ah-bx+2b+(k-ha)$. It follows that $d=-a, e=4ah-b, f=4ah+2b+k-ha$.

        " The vertex of the original parabola is (h,k) and its equation is y=ax^2+bx+c. By vertex form of the parabola we can write it as y=a(x-h)^2+k. Now we can say that a(x-h)^2+k= \u0627\u062e\u062a\u0635\u0627\u0635ofstream=ax^2+bx+c Hence, a(a)=a, ah=a(b), ah=a(c)Equating the constant terms on the left and right sides, we get k=c. Equating the coefficients of the x^2 terms, we get a=a. Equating the coefficients of the x terms, we get ah=b. Now we know that a equals a, so we can say that h=b. Therefore, the vertex of the parabola is at (h,k)=(b,k)=(b,c) (we were very careful in using (b,c) because this is the vertex so the value of the parabola at this point is the value that we know, k). Let\u2019s move on. The reflection of the vertex (b,c) about the line y=k is the point (b,k). Let\u2019s think, if we zoom the graph so that if we put the vertex at the origin, and we put the line y=k being y=x, then we can think that we\u2019re shifting back the reflection of the vertex by just shifting it back by b. (note that the line y=k is simply y=x) Now we can see that we can say d=a, f=c. Also, we can see that d(e)= \u0641+ce because we have reflected the graph, so we have changed signs of b and c, and the constant term c, or k, didn\u2019t change. Now we know that e=-b and f=c, so we can say that f+ce=k. Therefore, f(1+e) is k.

This results in the parabola with equation $y=dx^2+ex+f$. In terms of $k$, what is the value of $a+b+c+d+e+f$? Let\u2019s think step by step. From geometry, the reflected parabola has the same vertex $(h,k)$ as the original parabola. Therefore, the center of the reflected parabola is $(h,k)$ and the focus must be $(h,k+r)$ . And the focus of the original parabola is at $(h,k+\\frac{1}{4a})$.  Therefore, we know that $r=\\frac{1}{4a}$.\nLet\u2019s find the equation of the reflected parabola. To ge the equation of the reflected parabola, we need to make the following substitution: $a\\rightarrow -a, c\\rightarrow k+c$. The new equation is $y=-(ax^2+bx+r(k+c))$, which simplifies to $y=dx^2+ex+f$. comparing this equation with the equation we found earlier, we get: $-a=d$, $k+c=f$, $-b=e$. We also know that $k+c=\\frac{1}{4(-a)}$, which implies that $-a=\\frac{1}{4k}$. So, we get $d=-\\frac{1}{4k}$ and $f=k+c=\\frac{1}{4(-a)}+c=\\frac{1}{4}\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{k}}+c$.\nSo the value of $a+b+c+d+e+f$ is $\\frac{-1}{4}+1",
        " The equation of the given parabola is $y=ax^2+bx+c$.\n#### Vertex of the Parabola\nThe vertex (h, k) of the parabola can be found:\nLet\u2019s rewrite the equation as a perfect square:\nFirst, we have to write the given equation as $y = a(x^2+ex+f)$. Now we can write this as a perfect square:\nWe have to move the constant term to the right side of the equation:\n#### Complete the Square\nWe can complete the square using:\nHence, the vertex (h, k) of the parabola is at $\\left(\\frac{-b}{2a}, k\\right)$. Now we know about the vertex.\n#### Reflection\nThe reflection of the given parabola about the line $y = k$ would be $y = -a(x + h)^2 + k = -a(x^2+2hx+h^2) + 2ah + k = dx^2 + ex + f$, given as $d = -(2a)$, and since the origin is the center of the parabola, we have $e = -2ah$ and $f = -ah^2 + k$.\n#### Find $a+b+c+d+e+f$\nWe need to find the sum of coefficients of the original and the reflected parabolas.\nEstimating $a$, we have $\\boxed{-3a+b+c-3a-2ah-k+ah^2+k = 0}$.\n#### Conclusion\n$-3a+b+c = 0 \\Rightarrow a+b+c = 0$.\nThis implies $a+b+c+d+e+f = 0$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 0.

        " \nWe know the parabola $y=ax^2+bx+c$ opens downward and has vertex $(h,k)$, so $k = -d/4a$.\nWe need to find the new parabola $y=dx^2+ex+f$, but we know that shifting $y$ by $k$ doesn't change anything after dropping into a new coordinate system that replaces $y$ with $y-k$. In other words, the new parabola is equivalent to $y = d(x-h)^2+e(x-h)+f$. Examining this equation, it becomes easy to see that under shift, $c$ goes to $f$, $b$ goes to $e$, and $a$ remains the same. The vertex point $(h,k)$ becomes the origin in this new coordinate system, so $a$ doesn't change.\nSo, our answer is $(a+b+c)+(d+e+f) = \\boxed{a+b+c+d+e+f}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $a+b+c+d+e+f$.
