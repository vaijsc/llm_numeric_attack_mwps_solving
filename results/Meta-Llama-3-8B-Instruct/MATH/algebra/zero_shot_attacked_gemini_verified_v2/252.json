        " Start by using the exponent to rewrite our initial equation.\nNow we have $5^5 = x-18$. Since we can add 18 to both sides, we can see that $x$ is equal to which value? Now add 18 to both sides of the equation. Then we have $x = 5^5+18$. Looking at this value of $x$, we can see that $x$ is equal to 282.25. Now we know that $x = \\boxed{282.25}$. Finally, check that the answer is correct. Taking the logarithm base 5 of both sides, we have $\\log_5(282.25-18) = 5$. Dividing both sides of the equation by 5, has to obtain $5 \\le 282.25-18 = 264.25 \\lt \\infty$, where we know that 5 and 5^5 are its boundaries, then our final answer will be $x = 5^5+18 = 282.25$.\n### Alternative Solution:\nIf LN5(X-18)=5, then 5^5=X-18.
