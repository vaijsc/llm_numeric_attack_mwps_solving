(It is quick and challenging to realize what the problem is asking for). But after I took the time to read the question carefully and understand what was asked, I understood that\r\nf \u2032 (2) was actually asking to evaluate the derivative f(x) at x=2. Therefore, the obstacle seemed not as difficult as how I initially felt. I hope my understanding of it can be a help and a lesson for me in the future. The lesson I learned is to take my time and understand the problem.\nSecondly, after solving the derivative, I also encountered another obstacle. It was the step to find the critical point. I thought that the derivative was asking for the maximum value, I\r\nbecame puzzled about how I could find the critical point f(x). But then I realized that the derivative asked to find the value of f(x) where the function became flat. So I realized that when f(x)=\\frac{1}{4} the derivative would be zero. Therefore, f(x) is the critical point. The obstacle\r\nwas to misunderstood the requirement from the derivative. \n\\\\\\\\talked about something else. Here is what I hope I will be able to do differently in the future.\r\n\r\nFirst, before I dive into class, I will take some time to read the book or the assignment carefully. This will help me understand the requirements and concepts better. This will also help me clarify my doubts and make a mental note of any questions or obstacles I will encounter in the future.\\\\    I hope this will help me identify the obstacles in advance, before they become too difficult for me.",
