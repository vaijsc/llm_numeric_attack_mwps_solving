Is there anything you'd like to say about this problem or the process of solving it?### SuperFastSmile: Thank you! I'm glad to help push the correctness level of this book to 100%! Believe it or not, solving inequalities follows patterns, so once you get the hang of it, you can use your own experience to solve other inequalities. For example, when the inequality is in the form $ax+b\\lt c$, you can simply isolate $x$ by subtracting $b$ and then dividing by $a$. This problem was like a big test of my \"inequality-playing-muscles\". Thankfully, In the process, I learned how to really think about algebra.### FamousMathian: Brilliant observation! The more you solve inequalities, the more patterns you recognize and the more confidently you can solve similar problems. This is a fundamental skill in math, and I love that you emphasized the importance of practice and experience.

        " $x - 2$ must satisfy $-3/2 < x - 2 < 3$, which implies that $-1 < x < 5$, and the answer is (A).''\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 4. I hope it is correct. ###### If u dont have a horizontal line then u are not ready for this this is clearly a vertical line of answer choices ###### Focus on the two endpoints and think where simple inequality goes.\nIf I get two statements where one says minus 3 and other says six, i would immediately find my answer and jump to it.\nMy solution is focusing on the prior information, rather than breaking it down as before. This will save me more time, as I eliminate two possibilities right away and then handle the one left. This strategy of applying the simpler inequality first is usually helpful in these problems. Hence, the answer is $\\boxed{4}.$\n###### Practice "
