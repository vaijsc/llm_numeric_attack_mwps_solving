Doing this results in equation (1+7)^7. In other words, the result of this substitution is that the initial value of y is now used in the equation.\\\\ To find the final answer, the expression (1+7)^7 would need to be simplified. In order to do this, the 7 would need to be replaced with the value of y.\\\\ To simplify the expression (1+7)^7, the value of 7 would be used. First, the initial equation is: (1+7)^7.
