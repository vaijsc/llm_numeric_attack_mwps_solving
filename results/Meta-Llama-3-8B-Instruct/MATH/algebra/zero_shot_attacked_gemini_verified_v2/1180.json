        " To solve the equation $\\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{4}{x-5}$, we will follow the same steps to eliminate the fraction. Since both sides have the same denominator, we can multiply each side by $(x-5)$ to get $2(x-5) = 4$. Then, we expand the left side and get $2x - 10 = 4$, and then we can isolate $x$ by adding $10$ to both sides. We get $\\boxed{x=7}$.\nOur final answer is that the value of $x$ is 7.

I hope it is correct. ### i used a C/FM computer to solve the equation. I used the program to multiply both sides of the equation by x-5, and the program told me that the correct solution is: 6 ### Not a real solution. I asked the teacher about the solution, and she said it is actually 7. I think 7 is the correct solution, so I will take that. How do I do it by hand? So the method I used was the same method my teacher told me was correct. But I also used the method the computer told me. If you want to do it without a computer, then you could do it this way. This method is called the method of isolating the variable. Step 1: Multiply both sides of the equation by $x - 5$ to get rid of the fraction on the right-hand side of the equation. $2(x-5) = \\frac{4}{x-5}(x-5)$ Step 2: Simplify the left-hand side of the equation. This involves combining like terms and canceling any terms that are common to both sides of the equation. We can combine the like terms and cancel the $(x-5)$ in the numerator and denominator on the right-hand side of the equation. $2x-10 = 4$ Step 3: Add 10 to both sides of the equation to get rid of the negative term on the left-hand side. $2x = 14$ Step 4: Divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for $x$. $x = 7$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 7. I hope it is correct. ### ",
        " $x = 9$\nFrom the given equation, we can rewrite it as follows: $$2(x-5) = 4.$$ To solve for $x$, we can expand the left side to get: $$2x - 10 = 4.$$ Add 10 to both sides: $$2x = 14.$$ Divide both sides by 2: $$x = 7.$$ Thus, we find that $x = \\boxed{9}$.\n### Explanation: Not a typo.

We plug it back into our equation. $$\\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{4}{x-5}.$$ \\begin{align*} \\frac{2}{4} &= \\frac{4}{7-5} \\\\ \\frac{1}{2} &= \\frac{4}{2} \\\\ 1 &= 2 \\end{align*} As you can see, $x = \\boxed{7}$ isn\u2019t correct.\n### Correct answer\nGiven, $\\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{4}{x-5}$\nLet\u2019s multiply this equation by $x-5$, which results in: $$\\frac{2(x-5)}{4} = 4$$\nNow, expand the left side of this equation. You get: $$\\frac{2x-10}{4} = 4$$\nThen, multiply both sides by $4$, leading to: $$2x-10 = 16$$\nNow, add $10$ to both sides, as follows: $$2x = 26$$\nFinally, divide both sides by $2$, yielding $x = \\boxed{13}$.\nThus, we have that the correct answer is $\\boxed{x = 13}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is x = 13.

I hope it is correct. ### Mathematical reasoning: Multiplying both sides by $x-5$ eliminates the fraction, leaving us with a linear equation: $2 = 4/(x-5)$. Multiplying both sides by $x-5$ gives $8 = 4(x-5)/x-5$. Cross-multiplying produces $8(x-5) = 4x-20$. Distributing and simplifying, we have $8x-40 = 4x-20$, then add $8x$ to both sides, which becomes $16x-40 = 4x-20$, followed by $16x-4x=20+40$, and finally $12x=60$, concluding in the final answer of $x=15$. The step above shows all intermediate steps, resulting in the answer $x = \\boxed{15}$.$\\ \\ _\\ $ _______________________________________________________________ $\\ \\ _\\ $### Conclusion: Using the given equation, we find that $\\boxed{x=15}$.### Follow-up question: What is your process for solving equations?\u2022 Nov 17, 2021\u2022 \"Introduction to Algebra_\" ### Solution This is a linear equation in the form of $$\\frac{4}{x-5} = 2 ,$$ after cross-multiplying by $x-5$ , we get $$4(x-5) = 2(x-5) x,$$ which is easy to solve: $$4x - 20 = 2x, \\ 2x = 20, \\ x = 10.$$ See full answer.###",
