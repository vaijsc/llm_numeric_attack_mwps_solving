You see an exception there? Since Aiden's received at least one toy car since his first birthday, for his 42nd birthday, he's received the toy cars for his 41st birthday and his 42nd birthday, too, including his first birthday.

        " Aiden has been given a total of (42 x 42) cars. Since 42^2 = 1764, Aiden will have received 1764 toy cars from Jo after his 42nd birthday.\nGive feedback. Justify your answer and provide any necessary work or explanations to help me understand the question and the response. Explain how this response can be improved. 1764 is the perfect square of 42, so it is correct that Aiden will have received 1764 car from Jo after his 42nd\nI think the answer is correct, but I need to read it again. I can also see that it could be improved by explaining the logic of how you calculated the total number of car.  The response is clear, and the calculation process is correct, but it could be made more explicit and easy to follow.\nFor example, you could explain that computers are given one car for the 1st birthday, 2 cars for the 2nd birthday, and so on. This set up the 42nd birthday, it is easy to write down the equation as the sum of all the cars given, which is ( 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 42). Then, explain that this is an arithmetic sequence and you can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence (n * (n + 1)/2) to find the total number of cars given, which is (42 * 43)/2 = 882. I think that explaining the logic behind the calculation makes it more understandable.  1 Sloth       5:11 PM 10/13/2021\nI'll keep your feedback in mind and try to be more explicit in my explanations in the future.

The number of cars given corresponds to his age: one car for his first birthday, two cars for his second birthday, and so on. Let's calculate the total number of toy cars he will have received after his 42nd birthday. We can set up an equation for the sum of all the cars given: 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 42.

        " The problem states that Aiden has received at least one toy car every birthday, and the number of cars has corresponded to Aiden's age.

        " \nLet\u2019s think step by step.\n1. For his 1st birthday, Aiden received 1 car and in total he has received 1 car. (Age: 1st, Cars: 1)\n2. For his 2nd birthday, Aiden received 2 cars and in total he has received 1 + 2 = 3 cars. (Age: 2nd, Cars: 3)\n3. For his 3rd birthday, Aiden received 3 cars and in total he has received 3 + 3 = 6 cars. (Age: 3rd, Cars: 6)\n4. For his 42nd birthday, Aiden received 42 cars and in total he has received 6 + 42 = 48 cars.\nAiden will have received a total of **48** toy cars from Jo. \ud83c\udf89\n### Explanation:\nThis is a simple problem of pattern recognition and arithmetic addition. The pattern is that for each birthday, Aiden receives the number of cars corresponding to his age. To find the total number of cars received, we add the number of cars received for each birthday. In this case, we add 1 car (for his 1st birthday), 2 cars (for his 2nd birthday), 3 cars (for his 3rd birthday), and so on until we reach the 42nd birthday. This is equivalent to calculating the sum of the first 42 positive integers, which is equal to 42*(42+1)/2 = 903. However, since Aiden only receives a car for each birthday, we only need to add the numbers 1 to 42, not the entire range of integers from 1 to 903. Therefore, the total number of cars received is 1 + 2 + ... + 42 = 48. \ud83c\udf89\n### Notes: \nAlso, since we need to calculate the output of the sequence for his 42nd birthday, this means that we need to correctly identify the 42nd term of this sequence. This is equivalent to determining the number of cars he receives for his 42nd birthday, which is 42 cars.\nFrom the given information, we can establish the pattern of the sequence as: An = n, where n represents the age of Aiden and An represents the number of cars he receives. This pattern allows us to apply it to any given birthday, including the 42nd birthday.",
        " \nWe will find out how many toy cars Aiden has gotten for his 42nd birthday. As he gets one car for his first birthday, two cars for his second, and so on for each birthday, 2+(2+1)=3 cars for his third birthday, and so on. Therefore, we get the following http://prntscr.com/ld128l. Following the sequence 1+2+3+4+5+6+...+42, we get the following http://prntscr.com/ld12a1. So, there will be 861 toy cars received by Aiden.
