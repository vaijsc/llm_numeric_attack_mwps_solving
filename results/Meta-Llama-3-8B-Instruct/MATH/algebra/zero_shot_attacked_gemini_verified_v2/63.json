This would be as follows:\n$x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$\nHere, we would be using $b = 23$, $c = 6$, and $a = 2$. This gives us the following:\n$x = \\frac{-23 \\pm \\sqrt{23^2 - 4*2*6}}{4} = \\frac{-23 \\pm \\sqrt{529 - 24}}{4} = \\frac{-23 \\pm \\sqrt{505}}{4}$\nSimplifying: At this point, we can notice that the value under the radical simplifies to a perfect square:\n$505 = 5 * 101 = 25 * 20.5$\nWe know that $\\sqrt{505}$ must look something like $\\sqrt{25*20.5}$, and since $20.5$ is approximately $8$, we can use the difference of squares formula to simplify the radical further:\n$\\sqrt{505} = \\sqrt{25*20.5} = \\sqrt{25 * (8^2-1^2)} = \\sqrt{25 * (8",
        " The solutions to this quadratic equation are the zeros of $$f(x)=2x^2+23x+6,$$which can be found by the quadratic formula: $$ x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}.$$Now, we have $a = 2$, $b = 23$, and $c = 6$. If we substitute these values, we get $$x = \\frac{-23 \\pm \\sqrt{529-48}}{4} = \\frac{-23\\pm17}{4}.$$Therefore, the solutions are $$x = \\frac{-23+17}{4} = -1$$and $$x = \\frac{-23-17}{4} = -5.$$The product of these two solutions is $$(-5)(-1)=\\boxed{5}.$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 5.

Specifically, they wrote the product of the squares as $(\\frac{-23 + \\sqrt{505}}{4})^2 \\cdot (\\frac{-23 - \\sqrt{505}}{4})^2$, which is incorrect. The correct expression for the product of the squares is $\\left[\\left(\\frac{-23 + \\sqrt{505}}{4}\\right)\\left(\\frac{-23 - \\sqrt{505}}{4}\\right)\\right]^2 = \\left[\\left(\\frac{529}{16}\\right)\\right]^2 = 304.66$.\nTo avoid this mistake, the student could have tried to simplify the expression using the distributive property, such as: $\\left(\\frac{-23 + \\sqrt{505}}{4}\\right)^2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{-23 - \\sqrt{505}}{4}\\right)^2 = \\left[\\left(\\frac{-23 + \\sqrt{505}}{4}\\right)\\left(\\frac{-23 - \\sqrt{505}}{4",
        " \nWe have $2x^2 + 23x + 6 = 0$. We can write it as $2x^2 + 6x + 19x + 6 = 0$. We can factor out $2x$ from the left side. $2x (x + 3) + 19x + 6 = 0$. Now we can move $2x (x + 3)$ and $19x$ to the right side. We are left with $0 = 2x(x + 3) + 6$. Because of the right side, we have $6 = - 2x(x + 3)$.\nFinally, we need to solve for $x$. $x^2 + 3x + - 3 = 0$. We can factor again $x^2 + 3x + 3$. Then we have $(x + 3)(x + 0) = 0$. We have two solutions, $x = -3$ and $x = 0$. We can square each of these solutions individually. We have $(-3)^2 = 9$, and $0^2 = 0$. Therefore, the product of squares of the solutions of $2x^2 + 23x + 6 = 0$ is $0 \\times 9 = \\boxed{0}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 0. I hope it is correct.

To solve it, we use the quadratic formula. Let\u2019s remind ourselves what the quadratic formula is:\n$$x = \\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}.$$We can plug in our values for $a, b$ and $c$ into the quadratic formula. We get:\n$$x = \\frac{-23\\pm\\sqrt{23^2-4\\cdot 2\\cdot 6}}{2\\cdot 2} = \\frac{-23 \\pm \\sqrt{529-48}}{4} = \\frac{-23 \\pm \\sqrt{481}}{4}.$$Now we note that $481$ is not a perfect square, so we can\u2019t simplify this expression. However, we can simplify $\\sqrt{481}$. We notice that 481 is a odd number. If we try to find the largest perfect square that is less than 481, we get 480. So $\\sqrt{481}$ is a little bigger than 20. We don\u2019t need to be too accurate, and we can just write $\\sqrt{481} \\approx 20$. That means $x \\approx -11$ and $x \\approx -\\frac{3}{2}$.
