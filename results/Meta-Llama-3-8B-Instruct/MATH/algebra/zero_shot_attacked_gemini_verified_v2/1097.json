        " for the answer let x be the length of the plot, then the width is x + 5, and area is x(x + 5) = x^2 + 5x. We want the area to be at least 800, so we have the inequality x^2 + 5x \u2265 800.\n### Step 1: Solve the inequality for x\nWe need to isolate x on one side. The general strategy is to move all terms without x to the right and all terms with x to the left. \n### Move all terms with x to the left\nx^2 + 5x - 800 \u2265 0\nNow we have a quadratic inequality. Remember that a quadratic inequality of the form ax^2 + bx + c \u2265 0 has a graph that is either a parabola opening upward (if a > 0) or a parabola opening downward (if a < 0).\n### Determine the type of parabola\nThe coefficient a is 1, so the graph will open upward. \n### Find the x-intercepts\nWe can do this by finding the values of x that make the expression equal to 0: x^2 + 5x - 800 = 0\nThis is a quadratic equation and can be solved using the quadratic formula or by factoring. We will factor this equation as follows:\n(x + 40)(x - 20) = 0\n### Find the x-intercepts\nThe product of (x + 40) and (x - 20) is 0 when either (x + 40) = 0 or (x - 20) = 0. This gives us the following solutions:\nx + 40 = 0 --> x = -40 (extraneous solution)\nx - 20 = 0 --> x = 20\nThese are the x-intercepts.\n### Determine which x-intercept is the solution\nWe want the length of the plot to be positive, so x > 0. Therefore, we can disregard the x-intercept at x = -40 and focus on x = 20. \n### Add the inequality back in\nWe had the inequality x^2 + 5x - 800 \u2265 0. We found that x = 20 is the only solution, so we can write the inequality as:\nx \u2265 20\nSo, the length of the plot must be at least 20 feet.\n### Find the width\nWe know that the width",
        " Let\u2019s apply the formulas to find the length and width of the plot using the least amount of fencing possible.\nSince we know that the plot is rectangular, the area will occur when the width is 5 ft longer than the length. Let the length of the plot be x ft.\nThe width of the plot will be x + 5 ft. The area of the plot is 800 sq ft.\nUsing the formula for area, we can write:\nx(x + 5) = 800\nSimplify the equation to solve for x:\nx^2 + 5x - 800 = 0\nSolve the quadratic equation:\n(x - 20)(x + 40) = 0\nThe solution is:\nx = 20 ft\nor\nx = -40 ft\nSince the length cannot be negative, we will assume that x = 20 ft is the correct answer.\nThe width of the plot is 20 + 5 = 25 ft.",
        " The final answer is 30.\nThat is indeed the result. I hope you can understand the underlying strategy.\n### Step 1.\nHe wants a rectangular plot, so we can get an expression for the area (A = l \\* w) and an expression for the perimeter (P = l + l + w + w). Since he uses the least amount of fencing, we minimize the perimeter.\n### Step 2.\nSolve for P: We first solve the equation for l and get w = l + 5. Then, substitute for w in the expression for P:\nP = 2l + 2(l + 5)\nAfter simplifying, we have:\nP = 4l + 10\n### Step 3.\nWe know the area has to be at least 800 sq ft. So, we set A = 800, substitute for w, and solve for l. This gives us:\n800 = (l)(l + 5)\n### Step 4.\nExpand the equation, simplify, and solve for l:\n800 = l^2 + 5l\n0 = l^2 + 5l - 800\n(l - 20)(l + 20) = 0\nSo, l = -20 or l = 20. However, the length can\u2019t be negative, so we choose l = 20.\n### Step 5.\nNow that we have the length, we can find the width:\nw = l + 5\nw = 20 + 5\nw = 30\nThis is the minimum width while still having an area of at least 800 sq ft. The final answer is indeed 30.\nDual Learning Approach, including both mathematical and structural desc riptions, is useful for explaining complex strategies and steps to readers.

        "  We can write the area of the plot as: A = lw, where l is the length and w is the width. Robert wants the area to be at least 800 square feet, so he wants: A \u2265 800.\nThe width is 5 ft more than the length, so we can write the width as: w = l + 5 So we can write the area as a function of the length alone: A(l) = l (l + 5).\nNow we can substitute A(l) \u2265 800 into the area equation:\nl (l + 5) \u2265 800\nExpanding the equation and moving all terms to one side:\nl^2 + 5l - 800 \u2265 0\nBy factoring, we get:\n(l + 28) (l - 29) \u2265 0\nThis tells us that l + 28 \u2265 0 or l - 29 \u2265 0.\nThese inequality equations are very easy to solve:\nl + 28 \u2265 0:\nl \u2265 -28 (impossible in this case, since the length can\u2019t be negative)\nl - 29 \u2265 0:\nl \u2265 29\nSo our length is at least 29 ft. \nNow, we can find the width by replacing l with w \u2013 5, as we learned the width is 5 ft more than the length:\nw = (l + 5)\n9421c8d43ea2e7bd6f8d1971318e13a\n9421c8e43ea2e7bd6f8d1971318e13a\n```\n```\n9421c94343ea2e7bd6f8d1971318e13a\n9421cb043ea2e7bd6f8d1971318e13a\n```\n9421c94c43ea2e7bd6f8d1971318e13a\n9421c95343ea2e7bd6f8d1971318e13a\n```\n```\nw = (29 + 5) = 34\n```\nSo the width of the plot is 34 ft.

        " The area of a rectangle is length \u00d7 width, so 800 = length \u00d7 (length + 5).

What is the width of the plot? https://pillar-learning.com/2022/06/17/robert-wants-to-fence-a-rectangular-plot-of-land-of-at-least-800-square-feet-while-using-the-least-amount-of-fencing-possible/\n```  2022.11.22 Edited\n\"The area of the rectangular plot is the product of its length and width. We know that the width is 5 ft longer than the length, so its length can be represented as w - 5",
        " We define w to be the width and L to be the length. The area of the rectangle must be greater than or equal to 800. So, L * (w + 5) >= 800. We also know that the width is 5 ft longer than the length. So, w = L + 5. Let\u2019s put this equation in the first equation. L * (L + 5) >= 800. L * L + 5 * L >= 800. L * L + 5L - 800 >= 0. Now, we will break it down into 2 cases.\nCase 1: The width is 5 ft longer than the length and L * L + 5L - 800 >= 0. This is the same as L * L + 5L - 800 >= 0. L * (L + 5) >= 800. So, L >= 16.\nCase 2: The width is less than 5 ft longer than the length. In this case, there is no solution.\nNow, we know that L >= 16. L * L >= 256. L * L + 5L >= 256 + 80 >= 336 >= 800. So, L = 16 or L = 17 or L = 18 or L = 19 or L = 20. We will try each value.\n1. L = 16, w = L + 5 = 21.\n2. L = 17, w = L + 5 = 22.\n3. L = 18, w = L + 5 = 23.\n4. L = 19, w = L + 5 = 24.\n5. L = 20, w = L + 5 = 25.\nWe know that the area of the rectangle must be 800, so 16 * 21 != 800. 17 * 22 = 374, 18 * 23 = 414, 19 * 24 = 456, 20 * 25 = 500. The least area that meets the requirement is 500. When L = 20, w = 25.\nThe width of the plot is 25 feet.\n### Corrected Solution:\nLet\u2019s write L for the length and w for the width. The area of the rectangle must be greater than or equal to 800. L*w >= 800. Now, since the width is ",
        " \nLet x be the length of the rectangular plot (in feet). The width will be $x+5$ (since it is 5 ft longer than the length). The plot needs to have at least 800 sq ft area, which means:\n\\begin{align*}\nx(x+5)&=800\\newline\nx^2+5x&=800\n\\newline\nx^2+5x-800&=0\n\\end{align*}\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\\begin{align*}\nx&=\\frac{-5\\pm\\sqrt{5^2-4(-800)}}{2}\\newline\n&=\\frac{-5\\pm\\sqrt{1601}}{2}\\newline\n&=\\frac{-5\\pm39}{2}\n\\end{align*}\nThe solutions for x are -22 and 17. Since the length can\u2019t be negative (it\u2019s length, after all!), we disregard the solution x=-22 and opt for x=17.\nThe width, which is $x+5$, is now\n$$17+5=\\boxed{22}$$\nThat\u2019s the width of the rectangular plot in feet.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 22. I hope it is correct.  Let me know if you have any questions. God bless.",
        " \n#### Notice that the width `w` is $5$ ft longer than the length, so the length is simply $w - 5.$\nThe area of the plot is $$A = w (w - 5)$$  The amount of fencing used is $$F = 2 w + 2 ( w - 5) = 4 w - 10.$$ It follows that the area of the plot must be at least 800. We therefore have $w (w - 5) \\ge 800.$  Clearing denominators, we obtain $$(w-5)w \\ge 800.$$\nThe smallest possible value of $w$ that satisfies the equation is $w = 15.$ Then $w - 5 = 10.$ The required information is thus that the width of the plot is $w = \\boxed{15}.$\n#### Click here for the Video Solution\nhttps://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6yoqF8ACOAb1HEpoPAY3I8mlqAd6d4jM"
