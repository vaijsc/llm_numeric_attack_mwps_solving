        " \nLet the five consecutive integers be n-2, n-1, n, n+1, and n+2. We are given that the sum of these integers is zero. Therefore, we can write:\n(n-2) + (n-1) + n + (n+1) + (n+2) = 0\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n5n = -4\nn= -4/5\nNow, we can find the integers: n-2 = -12/5, n-1 = -7/5, n = -4/5, n+1 = -1/5, and n+2 = 4/5. The product of these integers is:\n(-12/5) \u00d7 (-7/5) \u00d7 (-4/5) \u00d7 (-1/5) \u00d7 (4/5) = 576\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 576. I hope it is correct.  ### Alternative solution using \u201cobservations\u201d\nIt is obvious that the sequence of integers will have both positive and negative integers for the sum to be zero. Let\u2019s observe the sequence in terms of its number of terms and the sum. \nThe sequence with one term will always be zero, which is not what we want. So, let\u2019s take the next sequence with 2 terms: -1 and 1. Their sum is zero, not in the pattern we want.\nNext sequence with 3 terms: -1, 0, and 1. Their sum is zero.\nFinally, the next sequence with 4 terms: -1, 1, -2, and 2. Their sum is zero.\nContinuing this pattern, we can see that it will have 5 consecutive integers: $\\{-3, -2, -1, 0, 1\\}$. Their sum is zero.\nThe required product is: (-3) \u00d7 (-2) \u00d7 (-1) \u00d7 (0) \u00d7 (1) = 0.  This alternative approach doesn\u2019t give the product explicitly but highlights the observation that the pattern of the sum being zero can be obtained by just considering the sequence of consecutive integers with an odd number of terms. \nFinal Answer: The final answer is 576.

I hope it is correct. 4 is the product of five consecutive integers summing to zero. The question is asking for the product. #### Explanation This math problem is about the sum of five consecutive integers being equal to zero.  It asks for the product of those five integers.  To solve it, we need to identify and find those five integers.  Let's call the first integer x. Then, the next four consecutive integers would be x + 1, x + 2, x + 3, and x + 4. The sum of those five integers would be: x + (x + 1) + (x + 2) + (x + 3) + (x + 4). We know this sum is equal to zero, so we can write an equation: x + (x + 1) + (x + 2) + (x + 3) + (x + 4) = 0. To make it simpler, we can combine like terms: 5x + 10 = 0. Subtract 10 from both sides: 5x = -10. Divide both sides by 5: x = -2. Now we know that x is equal to -2. Therefore, the first integer is -2. The next four integers are -1, 0, 1, and 2. The product of these five integers is -2 * (-1) * 0 * 1 * 2 = 4. The answer is 4. The product of the five integers 4 (-2, -1",

        " First, we have five consecutive integers: a, a+1, a+2, a+3, and a+4.\nSecondly, we have them add up to zero, so a + (a+1) + (a+2) + (a+3) + (a+4) = 0.\nNext, combine similar terms together to find (5a+10) = 0. Now, subtract 10 from both sides to get 5a = -10. Finally, divide both sides by 5 to get a = -2.\nSo now we know that a = -2. Then, the other four integers are -1, 0, 1, and 2.

        " (From Brilliant @ KateNiu)\nThe key idea here is that the sum of five consecutive integers is zero. We can use this to find two of the five integers. Let\u2019s say these two integers are $x$ and $x-4$. Since their average is zero, we have that \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{x+(x-4)}{2}&=0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x-\\frac{4}{2}&=0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x&=2.\n\\end{align*}The other three integers are then $2,2-4= -2, 2-2=-4$.",
        " To start, we need to find the five consecutive integers that add up to zero. One possible way to do this is by starting at a negative integer and adding five consecutive integers.\nWe can say that $x$ is the first integer. Then $x + 1$ is the second, followed by $x + 2, x + 3,$ and finally $x + 4$. The sum of these five integers is zero. So, we can set up the following equation.\n$x + (x + 1) + (x + 2) + (x + 3) + (x + 4) = 0$\nLet\u2019s combine like terms.\n$5x + 10 = 0$\nNow, we can subtract 10 from both sides of the equation.\n$5x = -10$\nThen, we can divide both sides of the equation by -5.\n$x = 2$\nSo, the first integer is 2. Since we know that the other four integers are consecutive, we can list them as 2, 3, 4, and 5. Their product is $2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = \\boxed{120}$.",
        " If the sum of five consecutive integers is 0, then at least one must be negative and one must be positive.\nIf we say the first integer is n, then the integers are $n, n+1, n+2, n+3,$ and $n+4$.
