        "  We need to find the time $t$ in years when Frederick is 18 years old.  Frederick will be 18 years old when his grandparents will give him the money.  Let $t$ be the time in years after Frederick was born that his grandparents will give him the money.  Then\nt+18=\\textrm{\\# total years}\\Rightarrow t=18-\\textrm{\\# total years}.\n### Since the investment is for 5% per year, the interest added per year is $0.05\\cdot$the current amount of money.  The total amount of money at age 0 is $\\$2600$,  and Frederick doesn\u2019t collect the money until he is 18.  Therefore, the amount of money $A(t)$ accumulated in $t$ years is \\begin{align*}\nA(t)&=2600+\\cdots+2600\\cdot \\left(1+0.05\\right)^t\n\\end{align*}where we add 2600 $t$ times because we add the interest from each of the years the money sits in the bank.

        " I think I understood the instruction\nMy first step is to calculate the interest portion of the investment.\u00a0 The interest, or the interest portion of the investment, can be calculated using the following formula: \\begin{align*} I&=P\\cdot r\\cdot t \\end{align*} where $P$ is the principal amount, which in this case is \\$$2600$, $r$ is the annual interest rate (in decimal form) which is 0.05, and $t$ is the number of years, which in this case is $18$ years less $0$ years that have already passed (because we are not giving Elizabeth the money yet), so $t = 18$ years. We can plug in the numbers and solve: \\begin{align*} I &= 2600 \\cdot 0.05 \\cdot 18 \\\\ I &= 234 \\end{align*} We want to find the total amount of money. We can do that by subtracting the interest from the principal. The interest is $\\$234$, so the total amount of money Frederick will have when he collects the money at age $18$ is $\\$2600 + \\$234 = \\boxed{\\$2834}$. (Checking) @MohammedTheTennessean please check my solution\n### Request: Please correct any errors and point out if there is any place I can improve.\n#### Fredrik\nthanks for the correction. I think I have a lot of improvement to do. The response was mainly just mathematical, but I didn't explain the steps in detail. So, the improvement I need to make is to explain my steps in detail. Thank you for pointing this out. @Fredrik Hi Fredrik!\nFredrik, I saw that you did the correct steps. You calculated the interest using the formula, and the principal plus the interest is indeed $\\$2834$. Your main area of improvement is explaining the steps. I think that\\begin{align*}I &= 2600 \\cdot 0.05 \\cdot 18 \\\\ I &= 234 \\end{align*}can be broken down into more parts. You can explain what the 2600 is, what the 0.05 is, and what the 18 represents. You can also explain why you subtract the principal from the interest. Breaking it down like this will make your response more clear and understandable.\nAlso, it might be good to add some space between your paragraphs. Right now",
        " \nThe total amount of money Frederick will have in his account when he can collect the money at age $18$ is given by the total amount he had at birth of $\\$2600$together with the total amount of money he can gain in interest over the $18$ years. The total amount he can gain in interest is$$\\2600\\cdot5\\%\\cdot18=2600\\cdot0.05\\cdot18=\\2600\\cdot0.9=\\boxed{\\$2340}$ Final Answer: The final answer is$2340. I hope it is correct.

        " Let's think step by step. Step 1 (Age 1, or no money earned):  $2600$\nStep 2 (Age 2, or $5\\%$ of $2600$ earned since then):  $2600 + 2600 \\cdot \\frac{5}{100} = 2600 + 130 = 2730$\nStep 3 (Age 3, or $5\\%$ of $2730$ earned since then):  $2730 + 2730 \\cdot \\frac{5}{100} = 2730 + 136.5 = 2866.5$\nSo on.  Since interest is compounded annually, Frederick will have $2600 + 12 \\cdot 130 = 2600 + 1560 = \\boxed{4160}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 4160. I hope it is correct.
