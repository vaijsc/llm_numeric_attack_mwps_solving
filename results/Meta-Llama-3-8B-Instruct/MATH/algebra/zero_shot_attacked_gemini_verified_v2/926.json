        " 831^2 - 2\\cdot 831\\cdot 530 + 530^2\nWe have a perfect squared difference expression. Let\u2019s factor it as $a^2 \u2013 2ab + b^2$, and we can notice that $a = 831$, $b = 530$. Therefore, our expression is equivalent to $(831)^2 \u2013 2(831)(530) + (530)^2$\n\u2022 $(831)^2$ can be evaluated using a calculator or we can rewrite that as $831 \\times 831$ which is $831 \\times 900$ \u2013 $831$ because $900 = 831 + 831$. We get $744,921$ \u2013 $831 = 744,090$.\n\u2022 $-2(831)(530)$ = -2 \\times 831 \\times 530 = -882,060.\n\u2022 $(530)^2$ can also be evaluated using a calculator or we can rewrite that as $530 \\times 530$ which is $530 \\times 560$ \u2013 $530$ because $560 = 530 + 530$. We get $296,400$ \u2013 $530 = 295,870$.\n\u2022 Now, let\u2019s combine the calculated pieces together. We have $744,090$ \u2013 $882,060$ + $295,870$. When we combine, we get -138,000.\n### Final Answer: The final answer is -138,000. I hope it is correct.

I hope it is correct. Thank you for your questions. Enjoy learning and exploring!  ### Explanation: This problem is a clever way to calculate $301^2$. First, we rewrite the expression $831^2 - 2\\cdot 831\\cdot 530 + 530^2$ as $$(831 - 530)^2.$$ Then, we factor out $530$ from the parentheses: $$530^2 - 2\\cdot 530\\cdot 831 + 831^2.$$ When we arrange the terms in this way, we can see that the expression is a perfect square trinomial. In fact, it is the square of $301=831-530$. Therefore, the value of the expression is equal to $(301)^2$, which is simply $301\\times 301 = 91301$. That\u2019s how we solve this problem.
