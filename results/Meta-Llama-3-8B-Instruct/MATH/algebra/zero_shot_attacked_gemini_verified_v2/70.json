        " First, let\u2019s express y in terms of x. Since y = 8, we can write y as 8. Now let\u2019s expand y^2 - 3xy + 8 using this value of y.\nNow, we can write y^2 as (8)^2, which is 64.\nSo, we get 64 - 3xy + 8. Let\u2019s simplify this:\n64 - 3x(8) + 8 = 64 - 24x + 8\nNow, we can simplify further:\n64 - 24x + 8 = 72 - 24x\nAnd we are done! The expression y^2 - 3xy + 8 can be simplified as 72 - 24x when x = 3 and y = 8.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 72 - 24x. I hope it is correct.",
