        " $2^{5/2}$ = $2^{2.5}$ = $\\boxed{4^{2.5}}$\n### Why is it a problem with complexity ###\nHere is the solution of the problem. $$\\sqrt[12]{16^5} = \\sqrt[12]{(2^4)^5} = \\sqrt[12]{2^{20}} = 2^{\\frac{20}{12}} = 2^{5/2} = 2^{2.5} = \\boxed{4^{2.5}}$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 4^{2.5}. I hope it is correct. Still, having trouble to simplify this. It is considered hard due to: - Small mistake in judgement of root index like (1/2), (2/3) , (3/4) ... - Finding difficult the simple forms of the final answer. Like in this case it is 4^{2.5}. This level is challenging for most of the students. It is appropriate as a challenge problem to reinforce student\u2019s understanding of identities and relationships between different radicand and indices. It requires the student to manipulate the expression by applying the rules of radical operation and exponents to simplify. Many students will not even recognize that this expression can be simplified in the way it was by writing the radicand in the form of a perfect power. For this reason, it is a powerful problem to use to assess student understanding of algebraic manipulation and identity. If you think it is too hard, you can always adjust the difficulty level. But ignoring this problem will lead to a lack of understanding about the relationship between different forms of radical expressions. This problem can be successfully solved with the use of polynomials, exponents, and radical functions. The instructor can use it as a bridge to other more complex problems, providing students with opportunities to apply these concepts to more advanced problem-solving scenarios. You can use the time to assist students in finding the simplification, here you can encourage them to apply the properties and meaning of the exponents and roots to simplify the expression: so we get that $\\sqrt[12]{16^5} = \\sqrt[12]{2^{20}} = 2^{5/2} = 2^{2.5} = \\boxed{4^{2.5}}$rgth problem you will always have this level. One way to make it easier is with careful reading and writing. Break it down as $\\sqrt[12",

Next, we rewrite $2^{20}$ as $(2^2)^{10} = (4)^{10}$\n3. Finally, we simplify $\\sqrt[12]{(4)^{10}}$ by using the exponent property of radicals. We elevate the index $12$ of the radical to a power of $10$, getting $4$ as the result. In other words, $(4)^{10} = 4^{\\left(\\frac{12}{12}\\right)10} = \\left(4^{\\frac{1}{12}}\\right)^{10}$\n4.

When you examine the various radicals you see that there are many $2^{\\hspace{0.05cm}}$ in the expression, and the negatives in the power rule.  Two $2^{\\hspace{0.05cm}}$ with an exponent that has an even value powers cancel out another $2^{\\hspace{0.05cm}}$. We repeat this process until we get the last $2^{\\hspace{0.05cm}}$.

I hope it is correct.  ### Explanation: \nWe know that the property of nth root of a number which are raised to a power is the same as taking the nth root of a number and then raising it to the power. This means: $\\sqrt[n]{a^m} = a^{m/n}$ for any positive integer $n$, and real numbers $a$ and $m$.\nUsing this property we can change the root $12$ into a radical of smaller degree: $\\sqrt[12]{16^5} = \\sqrt[12]{(2^4)^5}$.\nNow we just have to simplify this by considering that $\\sqrt[n]{b^n}=b$ for any real number $b$ and positive integer $n$.\nSo, we get: $\\sqrt[12]{(2^4)^5} = 2^4 = 2^4 = 2^{4*12/4} = 2^{4*3}= 2^4$\n$= 16^{\\frac{4}{1}}$\nSo, it simplifies as: $2^{\\frac{20}{12}}$\n$2^{5/3}$\n$2^{\\frac{20}{12}}$ can be simplified, because any fraction can be written as a part of another fraction, and if a fraction is in the denominator it can be transferred to the numerator of the fraction that it is in, as long as the denominator stays the same. This is how you change 12/12 to 1/1 and this is also how you can change 20/12 to 5/3 by division.\nSo, we get: $2^{5/3}$.\nThis is just $\\boxed{\\sqrt[3]{2^5}=2\\sqrt[3]{2}}$ because $\\sqrt[n]{m}=m^{\\frac{1}{n}}$\nor $\\sqrt[n]{m}=m^{1/n}$",
        " $\\boxed{4^{\\frac{5}{2}}}$\nFrom this equation, we have to take 12th root of 16 raised to the power of 5.\n$\\sqrt[12]{16^5}$\nNow by the power of power rule, we can simplify $\\sqrt[12]{16^5}$.\n$\\sqrt[12]{16^5} = (16^{\\frac{1}{12}})^5 = 2$ and by de Moivre\u2019s formula, $2^{5}$ simplifies to $2^{5}$.\nSo finally we get, $\\sqrt[12]{16^5}$ = $4^{\\frac{5}{2}}$.
