        " \nA quadratic expression has the general form $ax^2+bx+c$, where $a, b,$ and $c$ are real numbers, and $a\\ne 0$. The discriminant is $b^2-4ac$, which determines the nature of the roots of the equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$. The discriminant can be expressed as follows:\n$$D = b^2 - 4ac.$$ We can apply this to the given quadratic expression: $$8x^2-8x+15=0.$$Comparing to the general form $ax^2+bx+c$ gives $a = 8, b = -8$, and $c = 15$. Substituting these values into the formula $D = b^2 - 4ac$, we can find the discriminant:\n$$D=(-8)^2-4(8)(15)=64-320=-256.$$ Therefore, the discriminant of the given quadratic expression is $D = \\boxed{-256}.$\n### Explanation: \nThe discriminant is a way to determine the nature of the roots of a quadratic equation. It can be expressed as $D = b^2 - 4ac$. To find the discriminant, you need to know the values of $a, b$, and $c$, which in this case are $a = 8, b = -8$, and $c = 15$. Substituting these values into the formula, we find the discriminant to be $D = -256$. The significance of the discriminant is that it determines whether the equation has real or complex roots. If $D > 0$, the equation has two distinct real roots. If $D = 0$, the equation has a single real root. If $D < 0$, the equation has no real roots and has two complex roots.\nNote that in this problem, $D < 0$, which means the equation has no real roots and has two complex roots. However, we are not asked to find the roots or the nature of the roots in this problem. We are only asked to find the discriminant, which is $D = -256$. Therefore, the problem can be solved by simply plugging the values of $a, b$, and $c$ into the formula and simplifying. No additional work is required.
