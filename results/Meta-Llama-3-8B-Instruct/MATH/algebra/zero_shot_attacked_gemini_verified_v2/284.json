We can read: a is something we don\u2019t know, h is something we don\u2019t know, k is something we don\u2019t know. We are told: we have a function: f(x) = -x^2 + 4x + 5. We want to write it as some well-known form. We could try to guess: f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k But we need to check if it is correct. So we are going to variable x as x - h and subtract h from it. f(x) = -((x - h)^2) + 4(x - h) + 5 We are done. Now we just need to compare with given function: f(x) = -x^2 + 4x + 5 We see that 4(x - h) is 4x - 4h. So, -4h is 4. And finally h = -1. And we are done! Now we have: f(x) = -((x + 1)^2) + 4(x + 1) + 5 Now we are going to check again. It is actually not correct. 4(x + 1) = 4x + 4, so f(x) = -((x + 1)^2) + 4x + 4 + 5 f(x) = -x^2 - 2x - 1 + 4x + 4 + 5 f(x) = -x^2 + 2x + 8 But wait! We have -x^2 + 4x + 5! Not 2x! We made a mistake.  Now we go backwards. This means that our function is: f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k And actually it should be f(x) = a(x + h)^2 + k So we want 4 - 4h: 4 - 4(-1) = 4 + 4 = 8 We should multiply 4 term by -1: 8 becomes -8. And this Term we made it more easy. So we have: f(x) = a(x + 1)^2 - 8 Let\u2019s change it to differences of squares, because it is much more easy for us. To do it, we",
