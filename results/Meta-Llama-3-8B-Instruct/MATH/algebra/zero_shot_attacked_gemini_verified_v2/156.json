So, the correct answer is 12 here. 12 is the positive value of n. This is the answer of the problem by using the discriminant of the quadratic equation. 12 is the positive value of n. Final Answer: The final answer is 12. I hope it is correct. I have corrected my previous response. Let me know whenever there is anything else I can help with. Here is the information.\n### Explanation: We start with the given equation.\n$$4x^2+nx+36=0$$\nWe start by solving the quadratic equation. To solve the quadratic equation, we use the quadratic formula. Let\u2019s know ourselves what the quadratic formula is. This is the formula:\n$$x=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$$\nWhen we use this formula, we can solve any quadratic equation. The quadratic formula depends on the coefficients a, b, and c of the quadratic equation.\nIn the given equation, we have $a = 4$, $b = n$, and $c = 36$. We use this to find the value of x.\n$$x=\\frac{-n\\pm\\sqrt{n^2-4(4)(36)}}{2(4)}$$\nNow, we have nested parentheses. We find the simplification of the nested parentheses first.\n\\begin{align*}\nn^2-4(4)(36) &= n^2-4\\cdot16\\cdot36\\\\\n&=n^2-144\\\\\n&=n^2-12^2\n\\end{align*}\nNow, we are",
        " First, we aren\u2019t told that $n$ and $x$ are integers, so if $4x^2+nx+36=0$, we can\u2019t conclude that $x$ is an integer. What we do know is that the discriminant is zero. The discriminant is $b^2-4ac$, which in this case is $n^2-4\\cdot4\\cdot36$.  Setting this equal to zero, we have $$n^2-144=0 \\Rightarrow n^2=144,$$ and $n$ could be $12$ or $-12$. Now, if $n=12$, the equation becomes $4x^2+12x+36=4(x+3)^2=0$, which isn\u2019t true, as $x$ cannot equal $-3$. If $n=-12$, the equation becomes $4x^2-12x+36=4(x-3)^2=0$, which is true. The solution is $\\boxed{n=12}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 12. I hope it is correct.  If you want to know the rest of the video\u2019s explanation, I can provide it.  I can provide you the rest of the video\u2019s explanation as well. I assume you had previously watched the solution video before attempting this question.

        " $4x^2+nx+36=0$\nThe equation $4x^2+nx+36=0$ has a single solution if it is a parabola that only has one $x$-intercept, which means it must be a parabola with a horizontal axis of symmetry. In other words, the quadratic equation $4x^2+nx+36=0$ must be a parabola with a double root. But the discriminant of this quadratic equation is $(n)^2-144$. We know that this quadratic equation only has one solution, i.e., it is a parabola with a double root. Therefore, the discriminant must be zero. Hence $(n)^2-144=0$. This means that $(n)^2=144=12^2$, or $n=\\pm12$. But since the question asks for a positive $n$, we have $n=\\boxed{12}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 12. I hope it is correct.

        " $4x^2+nx+36=0$ can be expressed in the form $(ax+b)(cx+d)=0$. The equation has at most one solution in $x$ provided that $(ax+b)(cx+d)$ is irreducible quadratic. In a real polynomial, irreducible implies every coefficient is either zero or both leading coefficient and constant are zero. Otherwise the factors of the polynomial can be expressed in the form $(ax+e)(cx+f)$, where the sum of the coefficients in each factor are zero as well. Now we solve $n$. We can write $4x^2+nx+36=0$ as $(cx+d)(ax+1)=0$. We multiply them together and we get $4x^2+(2d+c+a)x+d=0$. Equating coefficients we get $d=36, 2d+c+a=0$ and $c=0$. That means we have $a=\\boxed{9}$. Therefore the answer is 9.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 9. I hope it is correct.  Please whoever finds any error, please do inform. Comment and let me know! ",
        " \nLet\u2019s set the polynomial $P(x)=4x^2+nx+36$ equal to $0$:\n$$P(x)=4x^2+nx+36=0.$$In order for this equation to have exactly one solution, $P(x)$ must not have any real solutions. We can use the quadratic formula:\n$$x=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}=\\frac{-n\\pm\\sqrt{n^2-4\\cdot4\\cdot 36}}{2\\cdot4},$$where $a=4$, $b=n$ and $c=36$.

I hope it is correct.  #### Q2 Problem Statement: Let $a$, $b$ and $c$ be three real numbers. Consider the following system of linear equations:\\begin{align*}ax+b&=1\\\\\\\\ c+ax&=0\\\\\\\\ 0&=1. \\end{align*} The three equations in this system are linearly dependent, so we have\n\\begin{align*}\na&=c\n\\end{align*}and some other condition.  What is this condition ? \n#### Solution: Let\u2019s use these conditions:\nSince the last equation is always $0=1$, which is a contradiction, we know that the system is inconsistent and thus the three equations are linearly dependent. Therefore, we have\n$$a=c.$$Additionally, the first and third equations are equal and then we can cancel the unnecessary equation. The remaining two equations become:\n\\begin{align*}\nax+b&=1\\\\\\\\ c+ax&=0.\n\\end{align*}Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get\n$$b+c=1.$$So, the condition is $b+c=1$. We can express $b$ in terms",

        " To solve for $x$, we can use the quadratic formula: $$x=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}.$$ In this case $a=4$, $b=n$ and $c=36$.

The quadratic formula is saying that there is only one value of $x$ where $4x^2+nx+36=0$.  In other words, the equation $4x^2+nx+36=0$ must be tangent to the $x$-axis, at exactly one point.In our case, the equation $4x^2+nx+36=0$ is a quadratic parabola whose vertex is where the equation is tangent to the $x$-axis. This means that the vertex of the parabola is at the unique point of solution. On other hand, the parabola is symmetric with respect to the axis of symmetry, which in this case is the vertical line $x=-\\frac{n}{8}$. The vertex of the parabola is then at $x=\\frac{-n}{8}$. At this point, we have $$4\\left(\\frac{-n}{8}\\right)^2+\\frac{-n}{8}36=0\\Rightarrow\\frac{n^2}{16}+\\frac{9n}{4}=0\\Rightarrow n^2+9n=0.$$ From here, we solve for $n$: $$\\begin{split}n^2+9n&=0\\\\ \\Rightarrow n(n+9)&=0\\\\ \\Rightarrow n&=0,\\,n=-9\\end{split}$$ However, we know that $n$ is positive, so $n=\\boxed{9}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 9.

        " The Given information is the equation $4x^2+nx+36=0$ has exactly one solution in $x$.\nSince the given equation $4x^2+nx+36=0$ has exactly one solution, it means that it has only one solution.\nFor finding the exact value of $n$, we need to find the value of $n$ making the given quadratic equation a perfect square. If the given equation becomes a perfect square, it means that it has only one solution, which is $+\\infty$.\nNow, $4x^2+nx+36=0$ can be written as $$(2x+\\frac{1}{8}n)^2-36+36\\frac{n^2}{256}=0$$This expression becomes a perfect square if $$36-36\\frac{n^2}{256}=0$$which is equivalent to $n^2=144$ or $n=\\boxed{12}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 12. I hope it is correct. Thank you for watching, and I hope you have enjoyed this practice video. If you have any questions or comments, please let me know.
