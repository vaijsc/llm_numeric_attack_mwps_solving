        " At first, let\u2019s simplify $5^{2x}$ and $256^\\frac{1}{2}$.

        " \nWe have to solve the equation $5^{2x} = 256^\\frac{1}{2}$. We note that $256 = 4^4$, so we can rewrite the equation: $$5^{2x} = 2^8 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = 2^{7}.$$ Now we can equate the exponents: $$2x = 7.$$ Since $x$ has to be an integer, we can divide both sides by $2$: $$x = \\boxed{3.5}.$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 3.5. I hope it is correct. Firstly we should consider the condition about x. Since $5^{2x}$ is a number greater than or equal to 1, $2x$ must be greater than or equal to 0. So, $x$ must be greater than or equal to 0. Secondly, $5^{2x}$ is a number less than $2^{8} = 256$ when $x < 0$. Let's do now the solution. We can rewrite $256$ as $4^4$, so we have $$5^{2x} = \\left( 2^2 \\right)^{2x} = 2^{4x}.$$ At this point we have $$2^{4x} = 2^7,$$ which implies $$4x = 7$$ and so $$x = \\frac{7}{4}.$$ We cannot conclude that $x = \\boxed{3.5}$ because $x$ can be any real number and we need to consider the condition about $x$ that is set at the beginning. Since $x > 0$, we can say that $x = 3.5$ is the only possible solution of $5^{2x} = 256^{\\frac{1}{2}}$, and it is a real number. Thus $x = \\boxed{3.5}$ is our solution.
