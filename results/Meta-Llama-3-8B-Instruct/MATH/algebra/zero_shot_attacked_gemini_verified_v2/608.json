        " \nThe expression in question can be denoted by $a$, so we want to solve $a=11$. Note that since we have a radical, $a$ must be non-negative. If we square both sides, we obtain $$a^2=x+a$$Now we can see that we can add $a^2$ to both sides to get $$x+2a=a^2$$Since we know $a=11$, we can substitute to get $$x+22=121$$which implies $x=99$. Finally, we check that $a=11$ when $x=99$, and therefore that $x=\\boxed{99}$ is the solution.\n### Solution Explanation:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item\nWe can denote the expression by a variable $a$ and rewrite the original equation as $a = 11$.\n\\item\nNow $a$ is the value of an algebraic expression, so we square both sides to get $a^2 = x + a$.\n\\item\nWe add $a^2$ to both sides to obtain $x + 2a = a^2$.\n\\item\nSubstitute in $a = 11$ to solve for $x$: $x + 22 = 121$.\n\\item\nSolve for $x$ to get $x = 99$.\n\\item\nVerify that when $x = 99$, $a = 11$ indeed holds.\n\\end{enumerate}\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 99. I hope it is correct.  This is the value of $x$ for which the given equation with infinitely many radicals evaluates as $11$, since $a=11$. We solve for $x$ in terms of $a$ by squaring both sides, adding $a^2$ to each side, and simplifying. We then substitute $a=11$ to solve for $x$. Plugging the solution $x=99$ back into the original equation, we find that it indeed satisfies the given equation.

Squaring both sides, we get\n$S_1^2=x+S_1$\nSolving the linear equation\n$S_1^2-S_1-x=0$\nBy the quadratic formula\n\\begin{align*}\nS_1 &= \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{1+4(x)}}{2}\n\\end{align*}\nBut $S_1$ must be positive, so we can assume that $S_1=\\frac{1+\\sqrt{1+4x}}{2}$. However, $S_1=x+\\sqrt{x+\\ldots}=S_1$ (because both are equal to the amount representing).\n\\begin{align*}\nx+\\sqrt{x+\\ldots} & = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{1+4x}}{2}\n\\end{align*}\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sqrt{x+\\ldots} & = \\frac{1-\\sqrt{1+4x}}{2}\n\\end{align*}\n\\begin{align*}\nx+\\ldots & = \\left(\\frac{1-\\sqrt{1+4x}}{2}\\right)^2\n\\end{align*}\n\\begin{align*}\nx+\\ldots & = \\frac{1-2\\sqrt{1+4x}+1+4x}\n\\end{align*}\n\\begin{align*}\nx+\\ldots & = 4x-\\sqrt{1+4x}+1\n\\end{align*}\n\\begin{align*}\n\\ldots & = 3x-\\sqrt{1+4x}+1\n\\end{align*}\nLet $y = \\sqrt{x+\\ldots}$\nThen $\\sqrt{x+\\ldots}=y$\nSquaring both sides\n\\begin{align*}\nx+\\ldots&=y^2\n\\end{align*}\nSimplifying this: \n\\begin{align*}\nx+\\ldots&=y^2\\\\\nx+(3x-\\sqrt{1+4x}+1)&=y^2\\\\\n",
        " $\\boxed{121}$\nThe first thing to notice is that the given expression is the same as $\\displaystyle u=\\sqrt{x+u}$, since the expression is a square root and we start with $u$ in the root and end up with $u$.\nWe also can say that $\\displaystyle u^2=x+u$, by squaring the expression.\nNow, we can say that $x=u^2-u$, or $u^2-u-x=0$.\nWe can solve for $u$ using the quadratic formula\n$u=\\frac{1\\pm\\sqrt{1+4x}}{2}$\nBut this is not helpful if we don\u2019t have the exact value of $x$.\nBut, we know that $u=11$, so we can plug it back in our original expression and we obtain\n$11=11 + \\sqrt{121 + \\ldots}$.\nSo, if we keep squaring, we must get $\\boxed{121}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 121. I hope it is correct. Can people explain how they thought of using the quadratic formula? I just used it because the book suggested it, but I never truly understood what I was doing.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 121. I hope it is correct. A simple approach is just to keep squaring the LHS by moving the sqrt to the square root: $$\\sqrt{x + \\sqrt{x + \\sqrt{x + \\ldots}}} \\Rightarrow \\sqrt{x + \\sqrt{x + 11}}.$$\nNow multiply both sides by $\\sqrt{x + \\sqrt{x + 11}}$.\n$$\\sqrt{x + \\sqrt{x + \\sqrt{x + \\ldots}}} \\cdot \\sqrt{x + \\sqrt{x + 11}} = 11\\sqrt{x + \\sqrt{x + 11}}$$\nSquaring both sides, $$x+\\sqrt{x+\\sqrt{x+11}}=121$$\nSo $\\sqrt{x+\\sqrt{x+11}}=121-11=110$. So, $\\boxed{x=121}$.\nNote: The approach of setting $u=\\sqrt{x+\\sqrt{x+\\sqrt{x+\\ldots}}}$ and solving the quadratic equation $(u^2-u-x=0)$ may also work. But as said earlier, without the exact value of $x$, the quadratic formula gives the generalised solution by which I don't know how to extract an exact value.$\\$\n##",
        " Consider the equation $\\sqrt{x + \\sqrt{x + \\sqrt{x + \\cdots}}} = 11$, and square both sides. After rearranging and solving for x, the solution is x = 121. \nWe will now develop a step by step solution.\nFirst, we will simplify the left side of the equation: $$\\sqrt{x+\\sqrt{x+\\sqrt{x+....}}} = \\sqrt{x+...}$$ Now we will square both sides of the equation: \\begin{align*} (\\sqrt{x+\\sqrt{x+\\sqrt{x+....}})^2 &= 121 \\\\ x + \\sqrt{x+\\sqrt{x+\\sqrt{x+....}}} &= 121 \\end{align*}\nNow we will solve for $\\sqrt{x+\\sqrt{x+\\sqrt{x+....}}$ \\begin{align*} x + \\sqrt{x+\\sqrt{x+\\sqrt{x+....}}} - 121 &= 0 \\\\ x+ \\sqrt{x+...} &= 121\\\\ x + 11 &= 121 - \\sqrt{x+...} \\\\ x + 11 &= 121 - y \\\\ x &= 110 - y \\\\ \\sqrt{x+...} &= y \\\\ x + y &= 121 \\\\ x &= 121 - y \\end{align*}\nNow we will plug in $x = 121 - y$ into the original equation and solve for $y$:\n\\begin{align*} \\sqrt{(121-y)+\\sqrt{(121-y)+\\sqrt{(121-y)+....}}} &= 11 \\\\ \\sqrt{121-y+y+\\sqrt{(121-y)+....}}} &= 11 \\\\ \\sqrt{121+\\sqrt{(121-y)+....}}} &= 11 \\\\ 121 + \\sqrt{(121-y)+....} &= 121 \\\\ 121-y + \\sqrt{(121-y)+....} &= 0 \\\\ 121 - y -y &= 0 \\\\ 2y &=121 \\\\ y &= 121/2 = 60 \\end{align*}\nNow we will plug in $y = 60$ into $x = 121 - y$ to find $x$: \\begin{align*} x &= 121 - y \\\\ &= 121 - 60 = \\boxed{61} \\end{align*} \nFinal Answer: The final answer is x = 61. I hope it is correct.  Moral (Mongodb) of the story is to never use arbitrary values and never substitute back the final answer.  I"
