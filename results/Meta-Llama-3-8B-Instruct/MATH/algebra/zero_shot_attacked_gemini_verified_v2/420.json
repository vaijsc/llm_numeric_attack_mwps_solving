My previous handle was wrong, when calculating the expression $P(x)^2$, the first thing to do is to calculate $P(x)$ first then do the multiplication.

        " $P(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3.\nFirst, $P(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3, so we can write it as $$P(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$$where $a, b, c,$ and $d$ are constants. Then we have \\begin{align*} 4x^3 - 6x^2 + 7x - 1 &= ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad a &= 4,\\ b = -6,\\ c = 7,\\ d = -1. \\end{align*}### Next, we square $P(x)$.\nHence, we can express $Q(x) = P(x)^2$ as $$Q(x) = P(x)^2 = (ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d)^2 = (?)$$.### We just need to square all terms in $P(x)$.\nA polynomial squared is the sum of terms obtained by multiplying each term in the original polynomial by itself, and multiplying terms together. Hence, all squared terms are \\begin{align*} a^2 x^{6} + b^2 x^{4} + c^2 x^{2} + d^2 \\end{align*} Let\u2019s consider $x^3$ terms.
