I hope it is correct. Need help understanding what the instructions are asking for? Look at this example of how to answer this type of question:\nFor what value of $x$ will give the minimum value for $f(x)=x^2+2x+1$?\nNow let\u2019s apply the method of completing the square to this function:\n$$\\begin{split}\nf(x)&=x^2+2x+1\\\\\n&=x^2+2x+1^2-1^2\\\\\n&=(x+1)^2-1\\\\\n&=(x+1)^2-1+1.\n\\end{split}$$Notice that when $x+1=0$, then $x=-1$, $(x+1)^2$ is minimized and the value of the function is also minimized. Therefore, the minimum value of $f(x)$ is $f(-1)=-1+1=0$ and the value of $x$ is $x=\\boxed{-1}$.\nNote: $x+1=0$ gives you the minimum because $(x+b)^2$ is always positive and it is minimized when $x+b=0$. In other words, a function of the form $g(x)=(x+b)^2$ has a minimum when $x+b=0$. If you square it yourself, you will also get $$(x+b)^2=x^2+2bx+b^2$$And you will see that the term $2bx$ will no way make this expression positive so $x+b=0$ must give you the minimum.

The minimum value will occur when$x=a=10$, so the minimum value of the function is $5$ at$x=\\boxed{10}$ Final Answer: The final answer is 10. I hope it is correct.  For any quadratic function of the form f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c, where a, b, and c are constants, there is a formula for the minimum value: x is equal to -b/2a. Since f(x) = x^2 - 20x + 5 and a is equal to 1, we can substitute -b/2a = -(-20)/2 which is equal to 10. Now that we have the x value of 10, we substitute 10 into the quadratic function to find the minimum value, f(10) = 10^2 - 20*10 + 5 = 100 - 200 + 5 = -95. There you have it!

        " To minimize $x^2-20x+5$, we differentiate it.\nThe derivative is $2x-20$. So, the minimum value of $x^2-20x+5$ occurs at $\\boxed{x=10}$.\n### Explanation: By the First Derivative Test, the minimum of $x^2 - 20x + 5$ occurs when $2x-20$ changes sign from negative to positive. Since $2x-20$ is a linear function, this can be resolved by setting $2x-20=0$, giving $x=10$ as the value where the derivative is equal to zero. A calculator can also be used to find the minimum value.\n### Sketch: ![](https://github.com/kurungoorai/learning-journal/blob/main/Alglib201/Alglib201-"
