        "  $$541+2(21)(19)+361=784+784=\\boxed{1568}$$\n# How would you explain your response?\nTo solve this problem, I recognized that the 2(21)(19) part is a product of numbers. Therefore, I promptly evaluated this part and acquired the value 798 (since 2 x 21 = 42 and 42 x 19 = 798). The problem would then become 541 + 798 + 361, which can be rearranged to 784 + 784, and easily solved.\nSo, the final result I came up with is the sum of 784 and 784, which equals 1568. This response shows how focusing on the product operation and using algebraic rearrangements can help solve the problem visually. # When would you prefer to use the strategy of writing out the multiplication in a problem rather than using the multiplication operation? I would prefer to use the strategy of writing out the multiplication in a problem rather than using the multiplication operation when (a) the numbers involved in the multiplication are not familiar to me, (b) the product operation is being used multiple times, making it more difficult to visualize, or (c) I need to check my work. For example, if a problem asks me to find the value of 15(24), I may choose to write out the multiplication as 15 times 20 + 15 times 4 to make the calculation easier. This strategy can help me break down the multiplication into smaller, more manageable parts and allow me to understand the calculation better. In contrast, I would likely use the multiplication operation when the numbers involved are familiar or the equation is straightforward. # Can you explain the concept of this strategy and how it benefits the problem-solver? The strategy of writing out the multiplication in a problem rather than using the multiplication operation is called breaking down or expanding the multiplication. This involves writing the multiplication as a sum of repeated additions, which can help to make the calculation more transparent and easier to perform.\nThis strategy benefits the problem-solver in several ways:\n1. **Visualization**: Writing out the multiplication helps to create a visual representation of the calculation, making it easier to understand and manipulate the numbers.\n2. **Breaking down complexity**: When dealing with complex multiplications, breaking down the operation into smaller parts can help to simplify the calculation and reduce the likelihood of mistakes.\n3. **Flexibility**: Breaking down the multiplication allows the problem-solver to use different methods, such as combining",

So, $x=\\boxed{1400}$.\nJameron asked, \"Can we always evaluate this way?\"\nYes, you are always allowed to rewrite the exponentiation (for example $2(399)$) into multiplication (example $2\\times 399$). This is a valid step in algebra. This type of action is also known as \"distributing\" the multiplication over addition.\nAnd, yes, you are correct that $2\\times 399$ is equal to $798$. When you distribute the multiplication over the addition, the result is just multiplying each term in the sum separately.\nIn summary, your approach is a good one and it works well in this example. You can use this approach whenever you encounter a similar problem in the future. And remember that you can always redistribute multiplication over addition as this method is a valid step in algebra. Happy solving! Jameron also asked, \"How do we know that this kind of operation is valid?\"\nThis question gets a little deeper into the mathematical idea behind it. In algebra, we work with expressions that can contain constants, variables, and arithmetic operations. The operation we applied in the problem, $2(399)$, is called distributive property (multiplication over addition).\nThe distributive property says that for any real numbers $a$, $b$, and $c$, the equation $(a+b)\\times c$ is equal to $a\\times c+b\\times c$. So, the equation $2(21)(19)$ is equivalent to $2\\times 21\\times 19$. This is because we are multiplying each term in the addition separately.\nThe rule of this distributive property can be generalized to any expression $(a_{1}+a_{2}+...+a_{n})\\times c$, where $n$ is any integer greater than or equal to $1$. This means that we can always distribute multiplication over any addition of constants, variables, or terms.\nThink of the addition as a bundle of sticks, and the multiplication as a force that acts on each of the sticks separately. If we multiply each stick in the bundle by a force, the total force will be the sum of the forces acting on each stick. The distributive property shows us how this force works.\nJameron, I hope this helps you understand why our operation is valid. Let me know if you have",

        "To solve the equation step by step:\n1. Start with the original equation:\n   \\[\n   541 + 2(21)(19) + 361 = x\n   \\]\n2. Calculate \\(2(21)(19)\\):\n   - First, multiply \\(21\\) and \\(19\\):\n     \\[\n     21 \\times 19 = 399\n     \\]\n   - Then multiply the result by \\(2\\):\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 399 = 798\n     \\]\n3. Now substitute this back into the equation:\n   \\[\n   541 + 798 + 361 = x\n   \\]\n4. Next, add these numbers together:\n   - Start with \\(541 + 798\\):\n     \\[\n     541 + 798 = 1339\n     \\]\n   - Then add \\(361\\):\n     \\[\n     1339 + 361 = 1700\n     \\]\n5. So, \\(x\\) is:\n   \\[\n   x = 1700\n   \\]\nThus, the final result is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1700}\n\\]",
