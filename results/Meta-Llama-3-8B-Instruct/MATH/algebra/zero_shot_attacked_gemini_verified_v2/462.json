This is $f$, which we already knew. It would seem that we did not solve for $f^{-1}$. But we will proceed.\nIf we want to find the value for $f^{-1}(2)$ then we need to put $x = 2$ into the equation.

        " \\left[f^{-1}(2)\\right]^{-1}=\\boxed{3/2} \\\\\nFirst, find $f^{-1}(x)$. Let $y = f(x) = \\frac{4x+1}{3}$. Cross-multiply to obtain $3y = 4x+1$. Subtract 4x on both sides to obtain 3y-4x=1. Factor 3y-4x=1 as (3y-4x+1). The left side of the equation becomes 0. Thus, 0=3y-4x+1. Add 4x on both sides of the equation. The equation becomes 4x=3y-1.
