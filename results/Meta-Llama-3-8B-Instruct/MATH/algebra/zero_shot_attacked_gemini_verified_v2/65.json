        " In this problem, we are given that mn=11 and m+n=8. We will use these two equations to find the values of m and n. #### Step 1: Use equation m+n=8. So, m+n=8. Since we want to find |m-n|, we can rewrite this equation by subtracting n from both sides as m-n=8-n. Now, we have expressed m-n in terms of 8-n. This will be helpful later. #### Step 2: Use equation mn=11. Notice that we are given mn=11. We can rewrite this equation by rewriting m as (m+n)-n, so mn=(m+n)-n=11. Now, we have n=m+n-n=11. #### Step 3: Substitute m+n=8 in the above expression. n=m+n-n=8-11=-3. So, n=-3. #### Step 4: Use expanded form of m-n=8-n in the first step. So, m-n=8-n=(-3)-n=8-n. Substitute n=-3 to this expression, we get m-n=8-(-3)=11. So, |m-n|=11. Final Answer: The final answer is 11. I hope it is correct. Let me know if you have any further queries.

        " Since we have $mn = 11$, we can split $m+n$ into $(m+n)^2-m^2-n^2$ or $m^2+2mn+n^2=11+64=75$. Then we move $m^2+n^2$ to the left side. We have $m^2+2mn+n^2 - (m^2+n^2) = 75 - (m^2+n^2)$. Simplified, this is $2mn = 75 - (m^2+n^2)$. Now the problem is divided into solving $mn$ (which is 11) and $(m^2+n^2)$. To solve for $m^2+n^2$, we can use $2mn - (m^2+n^2)$. By doing so, we can get a simpler form of the equation: $m^2+n^2 = 75-22$ = 53. That means $m^2+n^2$ is 53 and $mn$ is 11. We can then solve for $m$ and $n$ by dividing by $mn$. Let\u2019s take a look at the steps below:\n### Steps on Solving for m and n\n1. Divide m^2+n^2 by $mn$. In our case, we have $53/11$ = 4.833... (approximately). Now imagine m and n as 4.833... each. So m and n are both 4.\nOr can I believe? Why? Is this value range (0, +inf) suitable for solving for m and n?",

        " \nm*n=11, m+n=8. To find |m-n|, let\u2019s first write m and n in terms of each other. We have m+n=8, hence m=8-n. Substitute m with 8-n in mn=11. \nWe get (8-n)n=11. We can simplify it to \n- n^2+8n-11=0. \nSolving for n using the quadratic formula, we get \nn=3 or n=-4.\n### Explanation:\nIf we substitute n=3 into m+n=8, we get m+3=8, hence m=5. Therefore, the solution set is (m,n)=(5,3). So |m-n|=|5-3|=|2|=2.\nUsing n=-4, we also get m=-6. So the solution set is also (m,n)=(-6,-4). And |m-n|=|(-6)-(-4)|=|-2|=2.\nThe answer is |m-n|=2 since 2 is the absolute value of both 5-3 and -6-(-4).\n### Reference:\n* Online quadratic equation solver\n* Wikipedia: Absolute value\n### Tags:\nmath problem solving equations\n### Related Topics:\nMath, Problem Solving, Equations, Absolute Value\n### Learner Interaction:\nPlease solve the equations and verify the answers.\n### Errors:\n(See below)\nPlease post any errors or mistakes.
