        " Well, we are given that point A is moved upwards 20 units, and point B is moved downwards 4 units.\u00a0 So we subtract 20 from $b$ to get $b - 20$, and subtract 4 from $d$ to get $d - 4$. Next, we are told that point A is moved 14 units to the right horizontally, and point B is moved 3 units to the right.  So we add 14 to $a$ to get $a + 14$, and add 3 to $c$ to get $c + 3$.  So now we can substitute these new values into the expression for $M$. \\begin{align*} m&=\\frac{a+14+c+3}{2}=\\frac{a+c+17}{2} \\\\ n&=\\frac{b-20+d-4}{2}=\\frac{b+d-24}{2} \\\\ \\end{align*} Now, we start thinking about the new midpoint M\\prime.

If it weren't for the fact that the distances from A(0) and B(0) to the same marks the x and y, the letters we used didn't really matter.

Since the new $x$-coordinate of $A'$ is $a+14$ and the new $y$-coordinate is $b+20$, we have\n$$A'(a+14,b+20).$$Similarly, when we move $B$ downwards 4 units vertically and to the right 3 units horizontally, we get $B'$. Since the new $x$-coordinate of $B'$ is $c+3$ and the new $y$-coordinate is $d-4$, we have\n$$B'(c+3,d-4).$$Now the new midpoint between $A'$ and $B'$ is $M'$. Since the $x$-coordinate of $M'$ is the average of the $x$-coordinates of $A'$ and $B'$, we have\n$$m'=\\frac{(a+14)+(c+3)}{2}=\\frac{a+c+17}{2}=(m)+\\frac{17}{2}.$$Similarly, since the $y$-coordinate of $M'$ is the average of the $y$-coordinates of $A'$ and $B'$, we have\n$$n'=\\frac{(b+20)+(d-4)}{2}=\\frac{b+d+16}{2}=(n)+8.$$Therefore, the distance between $M$ and $M'$ is \\begin{align*}\n\\sqrt{(m-m')^2+(n-n')^2}&=\\sqrt{\\left((m)-\\left[(m)+\\frac{17}{2}\\right]\\right)^2+\\left((n)-\\left[(n)+8\\right]\\right)^2}\\\\\n&=\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{17}{2}\\right)^2+8^2}\\\\\n&=\\sqrt{\\frac{289}{4}+64}\\\\\n&=\\sqrt{\\frac{625}{4}}\\\\\n&=\\boxed{\\frac{25}{2}}.\n\\end{align*}\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\frac{25}{",
        " We know that $M\\left(\\frac{a+c}{2},\\frac{b+d}{2}\\right)$ and $M'\\left(\\frac{a+c+14}{2},\\frac{b+d-20+4}{2}\\right)$.  The midpoint is found as the average between the $x$-coordinates and the $y$-coordinates, so $M\\left(\\frac{a+c}{2},\\frac{b+d}{2}\\right)$.  When $A$ is moved horizontally to the right $14$ units, its new coordinate is $a+14$ and when moved vertically upwards $20$ units, its new coordinate is $b+20$.  Similarly, when $B$ is moved horizontally to the right $3$ units, its new coordinate is $c+3$ and when moved vertically downwards $4$ units, its new coordinate is $d-4$.  We then subtract the old coordinates from the new to get the horizontal and vertical translation values we want, $14$ and $20$.  Then, we move them accordingly.  $M\\left(\\frac{a+c+14}{2},\\frac{b+d-20+4}{2}\\right)$.  Now, let us think conceptually.\n$M'$ is the midpoint.  This is the average between both old points.  Part of the question is just how much each point has shifted.  There now is an equivalent number distance between them, like how there was already an equivalent number distance between $M$ and $M'$.  To measure this, the given info will be useful when getting the distance between $M$ and $M'$.  This problem looks like it\u2019s a formula, so we can solve it by our formulas we know.  Think, if you need to add, what are we adding?  The $x$-coordinates together and by half, and similarly for the $y$-coordinates.  $m=\\frac{a+c}{2},n=\\frac{b+d}{2}$.  For $M'$, $m$ has 14 and $n$ has $-16$.  Think, in polar cog.  No, not sure about this, we have Cog.  $M=\\left(\\frac{a+c}{2},\\frac{b+d}{2}\\right),M'=\\left(\\frac{a+c+14}{2},\\frac{b+d",
        " \nFirst, we calculate the coordinates of $M$. We have $m=\\frac{a+c}{2},\\ n=\\frac{b+d}{2}$. \nSecond, $A$ is moved vertically upwards 20 units and horizontally to the right 14 units, and $B$ is moved vertically downwards 4 units and horizontally to the right 3 units. Therefore, the coordinates of the new $A$ and $B$ are $(a+14,b+20)$ and $(c+3,d-4)$, respectively. \nThen, the new midpoint $M'$ is calculated to be $M'\\left(\\frac{a+c+3+14}{2},\\frac{b+d+20-4}{2}\\right)$. \nTo calculate the distance between $M$ and $M'$, we have\n\\begin{align*}\n\\left|\\sqrt{(m-(m+4))^2+(n-(n+8))^2}\\right|&=\\left|\\sqrt{(0-4)^2+(0-8)^2}\\right|\\\\\n&=\\left|\\sqrt{4^2+8^2}\\right|\\\\\n&=\\left|\\sqrt{16+64}\\right|\\\\\n&=\\left|\\sqrt{80}\\right|\\\\\n&=\\boxed{4\\sqrt{5}}\n\\end{align*}\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 4\\sqrt{5}.

        " Looking at the instructions, we have the following:\n$\\Rightarrow$ We have that $M(a,b)$ $\\Rightarrow$ Then have that $M'a_1=a+14$, $M_bb1=b+20$ $M'b_1=d-4$ $M'a_2=c+3$ $\\Rightarrow$ Want to find distance between $M(a+b2,c+d2)$&$M'(a+14,b+20)$=||$M$,M'|| $1^2+(b+20)-b-418$22 $M(a+b2,c+d2)$&$M'(a+14,b+20)$=||$M$,M'||\n$=sqrt[(14)^2+(b+20-b-4)^2]$=$sqrt(196+36)$=sqrt(232)$\\approx$15,6",
        " \nHere is the solution.\nGoing from $A(a,b)$ to $A(a+14, b+20)$ is a translation in the positive direction. Similarly, going from $B(c,d)$ to $B(c+3,d-4)$ is a translation in the fourth quadrant.\nIf we call the midpoint between $A$ and $B$, $M(m,n)$, then the new midpoint, $M'$, is $(m+\\frac{14-3}{2}, n+\\frac{20-4}{2})$. This is $(m+5,n+8)$. This means that the distance between $M$ and $M'$ is $$\\sqrt{(m-m-5)^2 + (n-n-8)^2}$$ Simplifying this, we get $\\sqrt{(5)^2+(8)^2}= 13$. Therefore, the distance between $M$ and $M'$ is $\\boxed{13}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 13.

        "\u00a0The midpoint $M$ has coordinates: \\begin{align*}m &= \\frac{a+c}{2} \\label{eq:1}\\\\ n &= \\frac{b+d}{2}.\\end{align*}Let $A'$ and $B'$ be $A$ and $B$ after they are moved.
