        " \nIf $j$ and $k$ are inversely proportional, then we know that $$j=\\frac{a}{k},$$where $a$ is a constant. [1]  With the information given, we find that $a = 16 \\cdot 21 = 336.$  Then, using this information and plugging in $k = 24,$ we can solve for $j$: \\begin{align*}\nj&=\\frac{336}{24}\\\\\n&=14.\n\\end{align*}  Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{14}$.\n### Additional hints:\n### Review of algebra\nSuppose $x$ and $y$ are inversely proportional, so $y=\\frac{a}{x},$ for some constant $a.$ If $x=x_0$ gives $y=y_0$, then we have\n$$y_0 = \\frac{a}{x_0} \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad a = x_0 y_0.$$  Therefore, the function $y=\\frac{a}{x}$ satisfies the equation\n$$y(x_0) = \\frac{a}{x_0} = y_0,$$and $y(x)$ takes the same value at $x=x_0$ as it does at $x=x,$ as long as we fix the constant $a=x_0y_0$.  Similarly, the function $j = \\frac{a}{k}$ satisfies the equation $j(21)=16$ and takes the same value at $k=21$ and $k = 24,$ as long as we fix $a=16\\cdot21 = 336$, and then we have\n$$j(24) = \\frac{336}{24} = \\boxed{14}.$$\n### Example applications\nThe value of $a$ could have been obtained through experimentation (or observations) that yielded the two ordered pairs $(x_0,y_0) = (21,16)$, as is common in applications of inverse proportionality. [2]\n### Footnotes:\n### [1] Note that we are using the convention that if $y=\\frac{a}{x}$, then $y$ and $x$ are inversely proportional.  With this convention, the constant $a$ could also be defined as the product of $x$ and $y$.\n### [2] Example applications would include studies of the relationship between distance traveled and time spent",
        " \nSince $j$ and $k$ are inversely proportional, we have the relationship that $j = k^{-1}$ or by writing this in terms of $k$, we have\n\\begin{align*} 16 &= (21)^{-1}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow 16&=\\frac{1}{21}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow 16 \\cdot 21 &= 1\\\\\n\\Rightarrow 336 &=1.\n\\end{align*} However, we realize that this is not correct since\n$16 \\cdot 21 = 336$ and not $1$.\nSo we can factor $16$ and $21$: $16 \\cdot 21 = (\\sqrt{16})(\\sqrt{21}) = 4\\sqrt{21} = 1$.\nThis means that $k = 4 \\sqrt{21}$. Now to find the value of $j$ when $k = 24$, we substitute in $k$ to get\n\\begin{align*} j&=\\frac{1}{24}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{j}}&=24\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad j&=\\frac{1}{24}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad \\boxed{j=\\frac{1}{3}}.\n\\end{align*}\nIf $j$ and $k$ are inversely proportional, we have that $j\\cdot k = 1$.  We are given that $j=16$ when $k=21$, so $16\\cdot21=1\\Rightarrow j\\cdot k=1$.  Solving for $j$, we obtain $j=1/21\\approx0.0476$.  Thus, when $k=24$, we have that $j=\\frac{1}{24}\\approx\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\frac{1}{3}. I hope it is correct.  I am trying to solve this problem by using the algebra method. So I rearranged the terms, and substituted in the first condition to solve the equation $j=\\frac{12}{24}=\\frac{1}{2}$. This means that the final answer was $\\frac{1}{2}$. So the final answer is 1/2. I hope it is correct. I am trying to solve this problem by using the algebra method.
