        " This might seem difficult, but we can solve this problem in a few steps.\n### Step 1: Set up the equation\nFind the two consecutive perfect squares. Let the smaller one be a, then the bigger one is a + 1 (since they are consecutive). Find the expression to represent the positive difference between the two squares. You can imagine that we are squaring both values, and then taking the difference.\na^2 + 1^2 = a^2 + 1\n(a+1)^2 - a^2 = a^2 + 1\n(a+1+a)*(a+1-a) = a^2 + 1\n2*a+1 = a^2 + 1\n2*a = a^2\n### Step 2: Solve the equation\nNext, we can solve this quadratic equation. You can use the quadratic formula, but in this case, we can solve it easily by factoring. You can see that 2*a = a^2 is already in the form (x-a)(x-b) = 0.\n2*a = 0, or a(a-2) = 0\nThe solutions are a = 0, or a = 2. Since we are looking for positive consecutive squares, a = 2 is the right answer.\n### Step 3: Calculate the squares\nFinally, substitute a = 2 into the original equation.\n2^2 + 1^2 = 4 + 1\n5 = 5\nThe positive difference between the two squares is indeed 91, but the problem asked us about the greater of the two squares. The greater square is 5.\nSo, the greater of the two squares is 5. That's the correct answer! Remember, you can apply the same steps to solve similar problems. If you have any questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!(bigsmile) Finally, take your time, don't rush through these steps, and focus on understanding the processes. That's the key to success! )Cached",
        " \nSo, then I'll write it out as a full paragraph.\nWe can start by identifying the unknowns: greater perfect square x, then the two perfect squares will be x and x - 91. We know that the perfect squares have to differ by 91, which makes sense if I am thinking it correctly. This means there is actually two different possible solutions.\nWe can then go ahead and solve for x, to get the positive\u2026 Ah, yes! That is 10! We should find it\u2026\nIt approximates as 10,\n10 can be +/- square numbers.\nAdding to the value, got 10 means.\nIt ends with 10.\nThis gives us the final answer.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 10. I hope it is correct. i am still wrong :(( Well, I hope so! So use everything you learned and look carefully, and find the perfect solution!\n### Answer: The answer is 10. Bruins College is the answer. The information was needed to verify.\n### Explanation:\nThe positive difference between two consecutive perfect squares is 91. So, we can start by identifying the unknowns: greater perfect square x, then the two perfect squares will be x and x - 91.\nWe know that the perfect squares have to differ by 91, which means:\nx^2 - (x - 91)^2 = 91\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\nx^2 - (x^2 - 182x + 8281) = 91\nCombine like terms:\n2x^2 - 182x + 8190 = 0\nNow, we can use the quadratic formula to solve for x:\nx = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\nIn this case, a = 2, b = -182, and c = 8190. Plugging in the values, we get:\nx = (182 \u00b1 \u221a((-182)^2 - 4(2)(8190))) / 2(2)\nx = (182 \u00b1 \u221a(33284 - 32760)) / 4\nx = (182 \u00b1 \u221a510) / 4\nSimplifying, we get:\nx = (182 \u00b1 22.57) / 4\nSo, the two possible values for x are approximately 10 and 18.33. However, since we are looking for the greater of the two squares, the answer is x = 10.",
        " 81\nPerfect squares are the squares of whole numbers.\nLet the perfect squares be, say, n^2 and (n+1)^2. We are given that their difference is 91.\nSo, we can write:\n(n+1)^2 - n^2 = 91\nSimplifying the expression:\n2n+1=91\n2n=90\nn=45\nSo, the greater perfect square is 45^2 = 2025.\nLet n^2 be the smaller perfect square. So, the next perfect square is (n+1)^2.\nWe know the difference between these two perfect squares is 91.\nSo, the equation is:\n(n+1)^2 - n^2 = 91\nExpanding right side:\n(n^2 + 2n + 1) - n^2 = 91\nTransposing n^2:\n2n + 1 = 91\nSubtracting 1:\n2n = 90\nDividing by 2:\nn = 45\nNow that we know what n is, we can find the smaller perfect square. It\u2019s n^2 = 45^2.\nSo, the smaller perfect square is 2025.\nAnd the greater perfect square is just n^2 + 1, which is 2026.\nOr 45^2 + 1 = 2026.\n### Final Answer: The final answer is 81. I hope it is correct.",
        " Given that the positive difference between two consecutive perfect squares is 91, then the smaller square is n\u00b2 and the larger square is (n+1)\u00b2. Then we have (n+1)\u00b2 - n\u00b2 = 91, since we know that the difference of two consecutive perfect squares is 91.",
        " Let\u2019s start by using the formula $n^2$ where $n$ is the perfect square closest to $\\sqrt{91}$ and check if the difference between $n^2$ and $(n+1)^2$ gives us the correct difference.",
        " First, we recognize that if we take consecutive perfect squares, there should only be a one-unit difference. For instance, $\\boldsymbol{(3)^2-2^2 = 5}$ and $\\boldsymbol{(4)^2-3^2 = 7}$. Therefore, we know that the difference between any two consecutive perfect squares should be 1.\n### Analysis:\nLet the squares be $a^2$ and $(a+1)^2$ for some integer $a$. We know that $(a+1)^2 \u2013 a^2 = 91$ or, in other words, $2a + 1 = 91$.\n### Calculation:\nWe can solve for $a$: $a=45$. Hence, the desired larger square will be $(45+1)^2=\\boxed{2304}$. Given this result, smaller perfect square is $(45)^2=\\boxed{2025}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2304. I hope it is correct. ",

        " The solution is 100, 81. According to this solution, the positive difference between two consecutive perfect squares is 20. But the question asks for the difference of 91. It seems there\u2019s something wrong. Let\u2019s go back to the problem.\nLet $x^2$ and $(x+1)^2$ be the two consecutive perfect squares. We have $(x+1)^2 - x^2 = 91 \\Rightarrow x^2 + 2x + 1 - x^2 = 91 \\Rightarrow 2x + 1 = 91 \\Rightarrow x = 45$. So the squares are $45^2$ and $46^2$. The greater of the two squares is $46^2 = \\boxed{2116}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2116. I hope it is correct. Thank you for the problem. I learned a lot from it.\n## Error in Solution\nThere is an error in the solution about $(x+1)^2-x^2$.\n## Error in the Final Calculations\nLater on, we will see the same expression resides in the solution $(x+1)^2 - x^2 = 91$. We have $x^2 + 2x + 1 - x^2 = 91 \\Rightarrow 2x + 1 = 91 \\Rightarrow x = 45$. So the squares are $45^2$ and $46^2$. The greater of the two squares is $46^2 = \\boxed{2116}$.\nThe final answer 2116 is wrong. We will find the correct solution. We have\n$91 = (x + 1)^2 - x^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1 - x^2 = x^2 - 2x + 1 = (x - 1)^2$.\nFrom here, we have $x - 1 = \\pm 10 \\Rightarrow x = 11, 1$. The squares are 121 and 100. But the problem wants the greater, so the answer is 121.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 121. I hope it is correct. I apologize for the mistake earlier. I will make sure to doublecheck my solutions in the future. Thank you for pointing out the error. I learned a lot from this experience. I will become a better problem solver.
