Although x >= -5 is more basic.) At last, considering whether 0 is included: x-4=0 or 4=x satisfying the condition (4-4)^2=(4-4)^2=0^(2)=0worked. In contrast, x-4<0 as x<4 would give you a negative number, and x-4>0 as x>4 would give you a positive greater than 9, both of which is not included in the condition.

        " 1. For an expression (x-4)^2, we know that, whenever it\u2019s squared, it is always non-negative. This makes sense because squaring is like multiplying the expression by itself, so when we multiply two numbers together, it\u2019s like adding them twice, which will always result in a positive or zero outcome.\n2. Because it must be non-negative, we can only see that (x-4)^2 <= 9 means that the absolute value of (x-4) is less than or equal to 3.\n3.
