What is this term? 4-digit Fibonacci sequence Last modification made on 6/26/2021 12:24am. Project Euler Problem 14 Find the first of the terms that is a multiple of 3 thousand. What is this term? Problem 14 asks us to find the first Fibonnaci number that is a multiple of 3 thousand. So our problem is to find the first Fibonacci number that is a multiple of 1000. Now hear my solution: The first Fibonacci number is 1, then 1, then 2, then 3, then 5, then 8, then 13, then 21, then 34, so on and so on. Now let's just take the following steps:\n1. We know that F(1) = 1. F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 1. F(3) = F(2) + F(1) = 2. F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 3. 2\n3. F(5) = F(4) + F(3) = 5. F(6) = F(5) + F(4) = 8. F(7) = F(6) + F(5) = 13. F(8) = F(7) + F(6) = 21.
