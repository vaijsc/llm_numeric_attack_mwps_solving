We can factor this quadratic equation. We notice that the middle term has an $x$ and a $-8$ which means we need a $-2$ and an $-4$ since these are the factors of $8$:\n$$(x+2)(x-4)=0$$\nWe know that for an equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ the solution is given by: $$x=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$$\n$$x=\\frac{-2\\pm\\sqrt{2^2-4(1)(-4)}}{2(1)}$$\n$$x=\\frac{-2\\pm\\sqrt{4+16}}{2}$$\n$$x=\\frac{-2\\pm\\sqrt{20}}{2}$$\n$$x=\\frac{-2+\\sqrt{20}}{2}$$ $$x=\\frac{-2-\\sqrt{20}}{2}$$ $$x=-1+\\sqrt{5}$$ $$x=-1-\\sqrt{5}$$\nNow we know the $x$-coordinates are $-1+\\sqrt{5}$ and $-1-\\sqrt{5}$. Add them up to get our final answer: $$(x_1+x_2)=(-1+\\sqrt{5})+(-1-\\sqrt{5})$$\n$$=(-1+\\sqrt{5})+(-1-\\sqrt{5})$$\n$$=(-1+(-1))+(\\sqrt{5}+\\sqrt{5})$$\n$$=(-2)+(2\\sqrt{5})$$\n$$=\\boxed{-2+2\\sqrt{5}}$$"
