        " Since we are given that $x^2 + 3x + 6 = ax^2 + b(x - h) + k,$ we can read off that $a = 1$ and $b = 3.$ All we need to do is to find $h.$ To that end, we can rearrange the above equation to get $(ax^2 - bx) + (k - h^2)$, and equate coefficients. On the one hand, we have that $ax^2 = 1x^2,$ while on the other hand, we have that $-bx=-3x.$ Therefore, $a = 1$ and $b = 3$ means that $1 = -3,$ which is a contradiction. It is not possible to expand $x^2 + 3x + 6$ in the form $a(x - h)^2 + k.$\n### My Answer: My answer is 1.\n### Plugging In: We can use substitution to find h. If we plug in 0 for x, we will find that $6 = k$. Then $x^2 + 3x + 6 = 1(x - h)^2 + 6$. If we let $x = 1$, we have $$1 + 3 + 6 = 1((1 - h)^2 + 6)$$ $$10 = 1 - h^2 + 6$$ $$8 = -h^2$$ $$\\sqrt{8} = \\sqrt{-h^2}$$ $$2i = -h$$ $$h = -2i$$ The correct answer is not 1.\n### Comment Below: How do I calculate the question based on the quadratic equations formula. Solution to this question can also be found by using the quadratic equation formula $$x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$\nWe know that a = 1 and b = 3, plugging this in we get $$h = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{(3)^2 - 4*1*6}}{2*1}$$\n$$h = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 - 24}}{2}$$\n$$h = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{-15}}{2}$$ $$h = \\frac{-3 \\pm 3i\\sqrt{5}}{2}$$\nSo",

        " 7 points\nWe are aiming to express $x^2 + 3x + 6$ in the form $a(x - h)^2 + k$. The form of the expression is a perfect square trinomial, so let\u2019s notice that it can be expressed as $(x + 1.5)^2 + (6 - 1.5^2)$. We can see that $h = \\boxed{-1.5}$.\n### Time Spent: 8 minutes\nExplanation: \nIn this question, we need to complete the square. The given expression is $x^2+3x+6$. This type of expression can be expressed as $(x-a)^2+b$. However we don't know what $a$ or $b$ is yet. To find it out, we can complete the square by rearranging the expression and adding and subtracting $1.5^2$.\n$x^2+3x+6$\n$\\Rightarrow x^2+3x+2.25+6-2.25$\n$\\Rightarrow (x+1.5)^2-2.25+6$\n$\\Rightarrow (x+1.5)^2+3.75$\nSo now we can see that $x^2+3x+6$ in the form of $a(x-h)^2+k$ is $(x+1.5)^2+3.75$, hence $h=-1.5$ and $k=3.75$. This can be cross checked by differentiating or computing values for $x$.\n### Correct! 7 points. Well done!",
        " \nHere\u2019s how to do it.\nFirst, we have to factor $x^2 + 3x + 6$: $x^2 + 3x + 6 = (x + 1)(x + 6)$.\nNext, we want to say: $x^2 + 3x + 6 = a(x - h)^2 + k$. Write as: $(x + 1)(x + 6) = a(x - h)^2 + k$.\n### Work:\nWe start simplifying the product $(x + 1)(x + 6)$, we get: $x^2 + x + 6x + 6 = x^2 + 7x + 6$. Compare it to $a(x - h)^2 + k$, we can replace $x^2$ on both side, get: $x^2 + 7x + 6 = a(x - h)^2 + k$.\nThen, we observe: The term $x^2$ cancelled out, but when we distributed out $x$ on the right hand side, we lost a coefficient $a$, that means we are going to put $a = 1$ for a moment. So our work now becomes: $x^2 + 7x + 6 = (x - h)^2 + k$. Now, we expand the right hand side, and get: $x^2 + 7x + 6 = x^2 - 2hx + h^2 + k$.\nThe $x^2$ terms on both sides equal, so we can write: $x^2 + 7x + 6 = x^2 - 2hx + h^2 + k$ $\\iff$ $- 2hx + h^2 + k = 7x + 6$.\n### Solve for h:\n Move all the terms involving $x$ to the left, and the constant term to the right, we get: $- 2hx = 7x - k - h^2$ $\\iff$ $h(2x - 7) = -k - h^2$. At this point, we put $a$ back. Multiply both sides by $a$, and get: $(2h)x - 7ah = -ak - ah^2$.\nTo get a constant term, we multiply $-7ah$, multiply both sides by $-1$, get: $(",
        " First, we must find a way to write the given quadratic expression $x^2 + 3x + 6$ in the form $a(x - h)^2 + k$, where $a$, $h$, and $k$ are constants. We recognize that \\begin{align*} a(x-h)^2+k &= a\\left(\\left(x-\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2+\\frac{9}{4}-6\\right)\\\\ &=a\\left(x^2-3x+\\frac{9}{4}-6\\right)\\\\ &=ax^2-a\\cdot3x+ai\\cdot9-6a\\\\ &=ax^2-3ax+\\frac{9a}{4}-6a\\\\ &=a(x^2-3x+\\frac{9}{4})-6a\\\\ &=a(x-3/2)^2-6a\\\\ &=ax^2-3ax+\\frac{9a}{4}-6a. \\end{align*} We can verify our answer above by simply comparing the $x^2$, $x$, and constant terms for our quadratic expression. Next, we can equate terms from both sides of the $a(x - h)^2 + k$ and our original expression $x^2 + 3x + 6$. We get $a=1$, which means that the coefficient of $x^2$ in our entire expression is 1. We also know that $-h=-\\frac{3}{2}$, so $h=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}.$.\n### Next, we have:  We have $k = 6$ for our entire expression, which is the constant part of our formula. Thus, we can conclude that $h=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}.$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\frac{3}{2}. I hope it is correct.

        " \nIf we express $x^2+3x+6$ in the form $a(x-h)^2+k$, we want to complete the square to get \n$$(x-h)^2+k=x^2-2hx+h^2+k.$$  \nThus, this means that \n$$k=6\\qquad  h^2-2h=\\frac{3}{2}\\Rightarrow h^2-2h+\\frac{1}{4}=\\frac{5}{4}\\Rightarrow\\boxed{h=\\frac{1}{2}}.$$\n### Explanation: \nCompleting the square is a clever trick that allows us to put the expression $x^2 + 3x + 6$ into the form $a(x-h)^2+k$.\nRecall that when expanding $(x-h)^2+k$, you get $x^2-2hx+h^2+k$.\nSo, in our case, we want $h^2-2hx+h^2+k=x^2+3x+6$.\nLet's simplify... \nWe are given that $k=6$, and we also know that $h^2-2hx+h^2+k=x^2+3x+6$.\nSo, we can simplify this equation: $x^2-2hx+h^2+6=x^2+3x+6$.\nThis simplifies to...  $\\boxed{h^2-2hx+h^2+6=x^2+3x+6}$.\nNow we just need to get $h$. We can rewrite this equation as  $6=x^2+3x+\\frac{9}{4}\\Rightarrow6=x^2+3x+\\frac{9}{4}\\Rightarrow6=x^2-2\\cdot\\frac{3}{2}x+\\frac{3}{4}^2+\\frac{9}{4}$.\nNow we can see that we have $(x-\\frac{3}{2})^2+\\frac{3}{4}$ (in the format $x^2+ax+\\frac{a^2}{4}+b$,  so $\\frac{3}{4}$ is the constant term $k$).\nSo, $h=\\frac{3}{2}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\frac{1}{2}. I hope it is correct.  Both solutions are correct, but  $h^2-2h=\\frac{3}{2}$",
        " $h = 1$.\nThe process to get $h$ is simple, we just have to factorise the quadratic expression $x^2 + 3x + 6$. Which gives you $(x+2)(x+3)$.\nWhen you compare this with the quadratic equation formula $a(x-h)^2+k$ we can see that $h$ will be $-\\frac{-3}{2}$. In the process it says $h$ will be $1$ only when the given quadratic equation is expanded and re arranged in that form."
