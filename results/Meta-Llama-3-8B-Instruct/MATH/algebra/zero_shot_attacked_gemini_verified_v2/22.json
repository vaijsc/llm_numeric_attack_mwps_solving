If we divide both sides of this equation by $37-1$ to isolate $37^{x-4}$, we obtain $$1 = 2^4(37^{x-5}).$$\nSince the left-hand side and right-hand side of this equation are equal, we can raise $1$ to the $4^{th}$ power on both sides of the equation to get $$1 = 2^{4^{th} \\times 4}(\\underbrace{37^{x-5}}_{\\text{stay same!}})^4.$$\nThus, after simplifying, $1 = 16(37^{x-5})^4$, so $37^{x-5} = \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{2^4}{2^0} = 2^4$.\nTherefore, the exponent of $37$ in numerator is just $4$ more than the exponent of $37$ in the denominator; that is, $x-5 = 4$, so $x=4+5=\\boxed{9}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 9.
