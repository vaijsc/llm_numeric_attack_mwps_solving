To do this, we can subtract 6x^2 and 8 from both sides of the inequality, giving us x - 6x^2 - 8 < 0.\n### Step 1: To isolate the x term, we divide both sides of the inequality by -6. This gives us \\frac{x}{6}-x^2-\\frac{8}{6}<0.\n### Step 2: Next, we add \\frac{8}{6} to both sides of the inequality, which gives us \\frac{x}{6}-x^2<\\frac{8}{6}. \n### Step 3: Now, we can multiply both sides of the inequality by -1 to get x^2-\\frac{x}{6}>\\frac{8}{6}.\n### Step 4: Finally, we add \\frac{x}{6} to both sides of the inequality, which gives us x^2>\\frac{8}{6}. This can be simplified to x^2>\\frac{4}{3}, which means that x^2 is greater than \\frac{4}{3}.\n### Now, let's find the greatest integer value of x that satisfies this inequality.

We will first move all the terms to one side, letting the equation equal 0:\n6x^2 + x - 8 = 0  For the opposite side, we will set it equal to 1 instead. Now, it\u2019s essential to note that this new equation, 6x^2 + x - 8 < 0, is true only when the original equation (6x^2 + x - 8 = 0) has no solutions. That is, we will attempt to solve the new equation, 6x^2 + x - 8 < 0, for these non-existent solutions.

        " Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide:\nWe first recognize that this is a quadratic inequality in the form of 6x\u00b2 + x \u2013 8 < 0. To solve this inequality, we want to find the value of x for which the quadratic expression is negative.\nWe can do this by first finding the roots of the quadratic expression by setting it to zero, i.e., 6x\u00b2 + x \u2013 8 = 0. We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:\nx = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 \u2013 4ac)) / (2a)\nwhere a, b, and c are the coefficients of the quadratic expression. In this case, a = 6, b = 1, and c = -8. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\nx = (-(1) \u00b1 \u221a((1)\u00b2 \u2013 4(6)(-8))) / (2(6))\nx = (-1 \u00b1 \u221a(1 + 144)) / 12\nx = (-1 \u00b1 \u221a145) / 12\nWe can simplify this expression to get:\nx \u2248 (-1 \u00b1 11.83) / 12\nSo, our roots are x \u2248 -1.11 and x \u2248 1.11. These two values satisfy the quadratic equation 6x\u00b2 + x \u2013 8 = 0.\nNow, we need to determine the sign of the expression 6x\u00b2 + x \u2013 8 for values of x between x \u2248 -1.11 and x \u2248 1.11. We can do this by evaluating the expression at x = -1.0 and x = 1.0:\n6x^2 + x \u2013 8\nat x = -1.0: 6(-1)\u00b2 + (-1) \u2013 8 = 6 + (-1) \u2013 8 = -3 < 0\nat x = 1.0: 6(1)\u00b2 + (1) \u2013 8 = 6 + 1 \u2013 8 = -1 < 0\nSince both of these values are negative, we know that the expression 6x\u00b2 + x \u2013 8 is negative for values of x between x \u2248 -1.11 and x \u2248 1.11.\nThe greatest integer value of x for which 6x^2 + x \u2013 8 < 0 is therefore x = 0, since x \u2248 1.11 is not an integer but",
        " We can start by writing the equation that we got after writing the given equation as a quadratic equation:\n6x^2 + x - 8\n### Reference: Consider the quadratic function $f(x)=6x^2+x-8$, which we know that its domain is $\\mathbb{R}$. We want to know the greatest integer value of $x$ for which $f(x)<0$. Notice that by the inequality of the quadratic function $f(x)$, $f(x)<0$ implies that this cannot happen when $x\\geq1$, since $f(1)=5>0$. This means that the largest possible value of $x$ would be given by the largest integer $x_0$ such that $f(x_0)<0$. Now, we can find $x_0$ by factoring the quadratic polynomial $f(x)=6x^2+x-8=(6x-2)(x+4)$. The equation $f(x)<0$ can be re-written as $$-4\\cdot x\\cdot \\big(6x-2\\big).$$This expression will be negative when its product $-4\\cdot x$ is strictly negative and $6x-2$ is strictly positive.
