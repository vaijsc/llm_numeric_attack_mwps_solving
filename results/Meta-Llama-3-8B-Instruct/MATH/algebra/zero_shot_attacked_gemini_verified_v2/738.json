        " One ticket to a show costs $\\$20$at full price. Susan buys4tickets using a coupon that gives her a95% discount. Pam buys5tickets using a coupon that gives her a30% discount. We first determine how much Susan pays.\nThe coupon Susan uses gives her a95% discount on original price, so subtracting it gives us 0.95(20). 4 tickets will then be 0.95(20)(4) = 76 dollars. We can simplify this expression:0.95(20)(4) = (0.95)(80) = 76. We do the same for Pam. Pam gets 30% discount, which means 0.7 of the original price will be paid, so 0.7(20)(5) = (0.7)(100) = 70. We want to find out how many more dollars Pam paid than Susan. We can find out by subtracting amount Susan paid from the amount Pam paid. So, 70 - 76 = 6 dollars. The answer is6.

You can DM me once  Awesome, let\u2019s figure out how much Pam pays:\n$3$\nSo the answer to this question is $3$ more than $5$, which is $\\boxed{2}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2. I hope it is correct.  One ticket at full price costs$\\$20$.  Susan buys $4$ tickets at $95\\%$ discount.  She will have to pay $20\\cdot (1-0.95)\\cdot 4=0.8\\cdot 4=\\$8$to get each ticket, so the total payment is $8\\cdot 4= \\$ 32$. Pam buys $5$ tickets at $30\\%$ discount.  She will have to pay $20\\cdot (1-0.3)=0.7\\cdot 20=\\$14$to get each ticket, so the total payment is $14\\cdot 5=\\$70$. Therefore, Pam pays $\\boxed{\\$70 - \\$32=\\$38}$more than Susan.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 38. I hope it is correct.  Let\u2019s consider how much Susan will pay, and how much Pam will pay in terms of the coupon discount. Susan\u2019s tickets will cost 20(1-0.95) = 0.8, so her total will be $0.8*4 = 32$. Pam\u2019s tickets will cost 20(1-0.30) = 14, so her total will be 14*5 = 70. We want to know how many more dollars Pam pays, so we can see that 70-32 = 38. So Pam pays 38 dollars more.  Let\u2019s consider how much Susan will pay, and how much Pam will pay in terms of the coupon discount. Susan\u2019s tickets will cost$20(1-0.95) = 0.8, so her total will be $0.8*4 = 32$. Pam\u2019s tickets will cost 20(1-0.30) = 14, so her total will be 14*5 = 70. We want to know how many more dollars Pam pays, so we can see that 70-32 = 38. So Pam pays 38 dollars more.

        " Let\u2019s start with Susan\u2019s tickets. With a 95% discount, she pays 5% of the full price. The fraction of full price is$$\\frac{5}{100}=\\frac{1}{20}.$$A single ticket therefore costs her$(1/20)(20) = 1$usd.With$4$tickets, she pays$4. Pam\u2019s situation is similar, except that the$30\\%$discount only saves her$\\frac{30}{100}=\\frac{3}{10}$of the full price per ticket. This means each ticket costs her$(1/10)(20)=2$usd.Having 5 such tickets, Pam pays$2\\cdot5=10$usd. How many more dollars does Pam pay than Susan? Well, Pam pays$10$and Susan pays$4\\. The difference of$10$and$4$is$\\boxed{6}$dollars. Final Answer: The final answer is 6.

The amount of discount Susan gets on each ticket is$0.05 \\times 20 = 1$. Therefore, the price Susan has to pay for each ticket is $20 - 1 = 19$, and so the total amount she has to pay is $19 \\times 4 = 76.$Pam buys 5 tickets using a coupon that gives her a 30\\% discount. The amount of discount Pam gets on each ticket is $0.3 \\times 20 = 6$. Therefore, the price Pam has to pay for each ticket is $20 - 6 = 14$, and so the total amount she has to pay is $14 \\times 5 = 70.$Thus the difference in the amount that Pam pays and Susan pays is $70 - 76 = 6.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 6.

I hope it is correct. Let me know if you need anything else.  We can use the formula P = Total Cost/N, where P = Price of 1 ticket, N = Number of tickets and Total Cost is Total cost paid.  So if Susan pays$\\$64$for 4 tickets, the price per ticket is $P = \\64/4 = \\16$, which means the discount is $\\16 \\times (1 - 0.95) = 0.8$. Similarly, the price per ticket for Pam is $P = \\133.333\\dots/5 = \\26.666\\dots$, and the discount is $\\26.666\\dots \\times (1 - 0.7) = \\6.6\\dots$Then we know that Susan pays $20 \\times 0.05 = \\1$for her coupon, and Pam pays $20 \\times 0.3 = \\6$for her coupon.

        " We set Susan\u2019s payment as $S$ dollars. She gets $4$ tickets at a 95% discount. The discount is $20 \\cdot 0.95 = 19$, and so she pays $4 \\cdot 20 - 19 = \\81$. We set Pam\u2019s payment as $P$ dollars. She gets $5$ tickets at a 30% discount. The discount is $20 \\cdot 0.3 = 6$, and so she pays $5 \\cdot 20 - 6 = \\94$.

Here is another method: First, we need to calculate the cost after using the coupon for each person.\nFor Susan, the cost of one ticket is $20 \\cdot 0.05 = 1$.

Therefore, Pam pays $\\70$.\nTo find out how much more Pam pays than Susan, we can subtract.

        "Let's break down the costs for both Susan and Pam step by step.\n1. **Susan's Cost:**\n   - The full price for one ticket is \\$20.\n   - She buys 4 tickets, so the total cost without the coupon is:\n     \\[\n     4 \\times 20 = 80 \\text{ dollars.}\n     \\]\n   - Susan has a coupon for a 95% discount. So, the amount she pays is:\n     \\[\n     80 \\times (1 - 0.95) = 80 \\times 0.05 = 4 \\text{ dollars.}\n     \\]\n2. **Pam's Cost:**\n   - Pam buys 5 tickets, so the total cost without the coupon is:\n     \\[\n     5 \\times 20 = 100 \\text{ dollars.}\n     \\]\n   - Pam has a coupon for a 30% discount. So, the amount she pays is:\n     \\[\n     100 \\times (1 - 0.30) = 100 \\times 0.70 = 70 \\text{ dollars.}\n     \\]\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Now we need to find out how many more dollars Pam pays than Susan:\n     \\[\n     70 - 4 = 66 \\text{ dollars.}\n     \\]\nTherefore, the final result is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{66}\n\\]",
