You've learned a valuable skill in algebra: completing the square! It can be super powerful in simplifying expressions and solving quadratic equations.If you have any more questions, I'm here to help!",
        " Write the equation as y = 4(x-1/2)^2+4\nWe can first factor the quadratic in the parabola. The vertex of a parabola is located at $x = -b/2a$. In this case, $-b/2a = -(-4)/2(4) = 1/2$, so we want to first get the equation into the form $y = 4(x-h)^2+k$. Then we can apply theproceduregotteninthenotionofvertexfortheparabola. Here is how we do it.\n$$y=4x^2-4x+4=4x^2-4x+1+3=4(x^2-x+\\frac{1}{4})+3=4(x-1/2)^2+3$$As shown above, we can write the equation as $y=4(x-1/2)^2+4$.\n### Analysis: Analyzing the vertex function y = 4(x-1/2)^2+4.\nAs we know, $(x-a)^2$ takes its smallest value when $x=a$, and has value $0$ when $x=a$. So the functionvalue in $x = 1/2$ is its smallest. Indeed, $(x-1/2)^2 \\ge 0$ for all values of $x$, but it is smallest exactly when $x = 1/2$. In the function $y = 4(x-1/2)^2+4$, $(x-1/2)^2$ takes its smallest value, which is $0$, when $x = 1/2$, so $y=4(0)+4=4$ is the smallest value of the entire function. Also, $y$ takes its greatest value when $(x-1/2)^2$ takes its greatest value of $1$, at which point $y = 4+4=8$. Therefore, the graph is open faced upwards, and $$(m,n)=\\boxed{\\left(1/2,4\\right)}$$\n### Problem checking: Getter a value for M. (at the correct vertex we get y = n = 4)\nLet\u2019s check for the $n$ value, since we know that $y = 4(0) + 4 = 4$ when $x = 1/2$ (at the vertex).\nAs requested by the problem,",
        " The vertex of the parabola described by equation $y=4x^2-4x+4$ is $(m,n)$; then we have:\n$$n = 4\\cdot m^2-4\\cdot m+4$$\nSubtract $4*m^2-4*m+4$ from both sides, we have:\n$$0 = 4\\cdot m^2-4*m$$\n$$0 = m*(4*m-4)$$\nFinally, we know that $m*(4*m-4)$ is equal to 0 only when $m=0$ or $4*m-4 = 0 \\Leftrightarrow m=\\frac{1}{1} = 1$. Since $m$ is a value of $x$, then $m$ cannot equal 0. Therefore, $m = 1$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $m=1$. I hope it is correct.  # additional_comments | Additional comments |\n Steven Lawrance | Never mind. I am not sure how you are getting your answer. However, the correct method is to complete the square. I can help with that. | Steven Lawrance | You are overcomplicating things. Just put the equation in vertex form. | Administrator | The provided solution was the correct one, but I appreciate your input, Steven Lawrance. Completing the square is also a valid method for solving this problem. If you want, I can provide more information about vertex form and completing the square. |\n Steven Lawrance | I apologize for my mistake. Yes, I would like to learn more about vertex form and completing the square. Thank you. | Administrator | No problem, Steven Lawrance. I will provide a brief overview of vertex form and completing the square. Vertex Form: Vertex form is a way to rewrite a quadratic equation y=ax^2+bx+c. The general vertex form of a quadratic equation is y=a(x-h)^2+k, where (h,k) is the vertex of the parabola. Setting the equation $y=4x^2-4x+4$ equal to 0 and completing the square, we can easily find the value of $m$. For more information, please let me know. Changing to vertex form is another valid method for solving the problem. | Steven Lawrance | Thank you for your explanation. I understand that we can change the equation to vertex form and find the vertex. I will remember this. | Steven Lawrance",
