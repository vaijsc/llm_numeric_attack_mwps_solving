        " \n1. Annie and Barbara should actually meet at the midpoint between Annie's location and Barbara's correct location. That's because they're walking towards each other from their respective locations.\n2. To find the correct location of Barbara, we need to know where she thinks she is, and then adjust her location by the difference in the y-coordinate (she thought she was at (\u22126,2), but she\u2019s actually at\u00a0\u221210,4).\n3. The correct location of Barbara is then (\u221210+4,4+2) = (\u22126,6). \n4. Now, we can find the point where Annie and Barbara should actually meet:\na.

I did not write any code for this question.) ",
        "1\nLet\u2019s start by finding the coordinates where Annie and Barbara should actually meet. We can use the midpoint formula for this, which is the average of the x-coordinates of the two locations, averaged with the y-coordinates of the two locations.\nThe x-coordinates are 5 (Annie) and -10 (Barbara), so the midpoint of these two x-coordinates is (5 + (-10))/2 = -2.5.\nSimilarly, the y-coordinates are 5 (Annie) and 4 (Barbara), so the midpoint of these two y-coordinates is (5 + 4)/2 = 4.5.\nSo, the coordinates where Annie and Barbara should actually meet are (-2.5, 4.5).\nNow we need to find the coordinates where they actually met, according to Barbara\u2019s misreading of the map. Barbara thought she was at (-6,2), which means she thought the x-coordinate was (-6) instead of (-10). So we need to find the new x-coordinate.\nThe new x-coordinate is -6 + 4 = -2, since the x-coordinates are 4 units closer (toward -2.5).\nSo, the new x-coordinate is -2.\nThe y-coordinate remains the same, which is 2.\nSo, the coordinates where Annie and Barbara actually met are (-2, 2).\nThe positive difference between the actual meeting coordinates and the correct meeting coordinates is:\n(-2.5 - (-2)) = -2.5 + 2 = 0.5\nSo, the positive difference is 0.5. Note that since we are finding the difference, we take 2.5 - (-2), but subtract (-2) = add 2, to get 0.5. We can confirm by checking that 0.5 is positive.### ",

We are asked to find the positive difference between their x-coordinates. First, we correct Barbara's position by adding 4 to -10. So, Barbara should have been at (-6,2).

We can use this formula to find the coordinates where they agreed to meet.\nd = sqrt((5 - x)^2 + (5 - y)^2)\nWe can simplify this equation by writing the squared terms as:\nd = sqrt(x^2 - 10x + 25 + y^2 - 10y + 25)\nNow we can simplify the right-hand side of this equation:\nd = sqrt(x^2 - 10x + y^2 - 10y + 50)\nLet's create an equation where d is equal to zero, since they are at the same distance from some point.\n0 = sqrt(x^2 - 10x + y^2 - 10y + 50)\nsquare both sides of the equation to get:\n0 = x^2 - 10x + y^2 - 10y + 50\nNow let's square both x and y terms and solve the equation.\n0 = x^2 - 10x + y^2 - 10y + 50 + 100\nLet's break it down into two equations:\na) x^2 - 10x + 50 = 0\nb) y^2 - 10y + 50 = 0\nWe can solve both equations:\na) x^2 - 10x + 50 = 0\nfactors as:\n(x - 5)^2 = 0\nTherefore, x = 5\nb) y^2 - 10y + 50 = 0\nfactors as:\n(y - 5)^2 = 0\nTherefore, y = 5\nSo, they agreed to meet at coordinates (5,5).\n### Step 2: Find the coordinates where they should actually meet if Annie is located at (5,5) and Barbara is located at (-10,4), but Barbara read the map wrong and thought she was at (-6,2).\nNow",
        " \nWe have been asked to find the positive difference in the x-coordinates of where Annie and Barbara agreed to meet and where they should actually meet.\nFirst, we need to find the coordinates where Annie and Barbara agreed to meet. Since they are both on the same plane and gave the same mean point, the coordinates of their meet point is the average of their coordinates.\n$$\\dfrac{(5+(-10))/2, (5+4)/2} = (5-10)/2, (5+4)/2} = (-5/2, 9/2}$$\nNow, we need to find the coordinates where Barbara should actually meet. Since she is at (-6,2), the coordinates of their meet point is the average of her coordinates and Annie's coordinates.\n$$\\dfrac{(-6+5)/2, (2+5)/2} = (-1/2, 3.5}$$\nThe positive difference in the x-coordinates of where Annie and Barbara agreed to meet and where they should actually meet is 5/2 - (-1/2) = 6/2 = 3. So, the difference is 3. \n### Answer: The positive difference in the x-coordinates of where Annie and Barbara agreed to meet and where they should actually meet is $\\boxed{3}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 3. I hope it is correct. "
