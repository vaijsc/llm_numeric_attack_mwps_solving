I hope it is correct. \nLet me know if you need further question. \n### Tips: \nIn this problem, you need to follow the order of operations of function evaluation. \nFirst, we plug $2$ into the function $f(x)$ and get $f(2)$. \nThen, we plug the output $f(2)$ into the function $g(x)$ to get the final answer. \n### Alternate Tips: \nYou can draw a tree diagram or a vertical stack of function evaluation to help you evaluate the functions correctly. \nOr, you can read the problem carefully and realize that only one function is evaluated in the innermost pair of parentheses. \nThen, go ahead and evaluate the function in the innermost pair of parentheses, and so on. \nThis strategy can help you avoid mistakes when evaluating complex expressions. \n### See also: \nFunction evaluation, Order of operations. \n### Tags: \nFunction evaluation, Algebra. \n### Note: \nThis solution is written by AoPS user YongL. 5 * ( 5 + 2 * 2! + 2! 5 * 55 + 1 / 2 + 2 * 9 ) ^= \n= 5 * ( 5 + 2 * 2 + 10 + 1 / 2 + 2 * 9 ) ^= \n= 5 * ( 5 + 2 * 2 + 2 * 9 + 10 + ( 1 / 2 ) ) ^= \n= 5 * 5 + 2 * 2 * 5 + 2 * 9 * 5 + 10 * 5 + 2 * 0.5 ^= \n= 25 + 10 + 30 + 10 + 1 ^= \n= 76.  $$m n = \\boxed{\\}^{5}raki^{~!}}{{[u]{[.t]^{~r}} addon ^{\\}##}\\]\" \n= 5",

I hope it is correct.  ### Another response: \nWe first find what $f(2)$ is by substituting $2$ into the function $f(x)$. We find that:\n\\begin{align*}\nf(x) &= 5x+3\\\\\nf(2) &= 5(2)+3 = 11\n\\end{align*}Then, we substitute this value back into the function $g(x)$ to find what $g(f(2))$ is:\n\\begin{align*}\ng(x) &= x^2-2\\\\\ng(11) &= 11^2-2 = 121 - 2 = 119\n\\end{align*} So, $g(f(2)) = 119$. Final Answer: The final answer is 119. I hope it is correct.  ### Solution 2  If you don\u2019t want to use letters, you can say we want to find $$(f\\circ g)(2).$$  The $\\circ$ symbol means apply functions left to right. So $$(f\\circ g)(2)=f(g(2))=f(2^2-2)=f(4-2)=f(2)=5(2)+3=11.$$  And then $$(f\\circ g)(2)=g(11)=11^2-2=121-2=119.$$ Final Answer: The final answer is 119.

It is necessary to know how to compose functions to see this problem. If you need a simple reminder, just substitute and plug in. It takes a little practice but it is easy.  It is good practice for functions.  The final answer is 165 because we are getting the value of f(2) which is 13, then plugging it into g(x) which gives g(13) which is 165.  It is easy to understand if you base it on the problem information and the function composition. The USE OF FUNCTION COMPOSITION allows us to solve the problem easily. It is a useful tool in many math problems and math competitions.  The answer 165 is correct. The  and the definition and usage of functions are important in many areas of math and beyond.  This is a great exercise in using function composition. It is important to review and practice function composition problem like this one to increase your capabilities in solving math problems.    The final answer is 165. We can use the function composition property to solve this problem. It is very important to remember the function composition property, that is $(g \\circ f)(x) = g(f(x))$. We can use this property to solve this problem. We can apply the property where $g(x)=x^2-2$ and $f(x) = 5x+3$. Therefore, we can evaluate $(g \\circ f)(x) = g(f(x)) = g(5x+3)=(5x+3)^2-2=25x^2+30x+9-2=25x^2+30x+7$. We can plug in 2 for x, we get $(g \\circ f)(2",

        " \nWe are asked to evaluate $g(f(2))$, which means we should first plug in 2 into function f, then use the result as input into function g.\nWe have $f(x) = 5x+3$, so $f(2) = 5(2)+3 = 11$. Hence, we plug in this into $g(x) = x^2-2$, getting $g(11) = (11)^2 -2 = \\boxed{111}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 111. I hope it is correct. 1\n### Observation:\nIt is very important to evaluate $f(2)$ before plugging its value into $g(x)$.\nIf you accidentally plug in 2 directly into $g(x)$, you get $g(2) = 2^2-2 = 2$, which is definitely incorrect. This is a common mistake that students make in composition of functions. Always make sure to evaluate the function you are applying before using its value in another function.",

Now that we have the value of $f(2)$, we can use it in $g(x)$ to get $g(f(2)) = (f(2))^2-2 = 11^2 - 2 = 121-2 = \\boxed{119}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 119.
