        " Let $a, i, u$ be the number of correct answers, incorrect answers and unattempted questions respectively.\nSince the number of questions attempted is $80$, we have $a+i+u=80$.\nWe also have $\\boxed{a+i\\cdot -2+5u=232}$.\nSolving for $i$, we get $i=14$.",
        " 72\n### Reasoning:\nLet $x$ be the number of correct answers.\nThen , the number of incorrect answers is $(80-x)$.\nLet the number of unanswered questions be $y$, which is $200 - 80 - (80-x) = 40$.\nFirstly, the number of correct answers, $x$ is multiplied by 5 to get the total score, so $5x$. Secondly, the number of incorrect answers, $(80-x)$ is multiplied by -2 to get the total score, so $-(80-x) \\cdot 2 = -160 + 2x$. Lastly, the number of unanswered questions, 40, is multiplied by 0, so $40 \\cdot 0 = 0$.\nAll answers are added up to get the total score, $232$: $5x + (-160 + 2x) + 0 = 232$.\nNow, simplify the equation: $5x - 160 + 2x = 232 \\implies 7x = 392 \\implies x = 56$.\nHowever, we are told that Frank only answered 80 questions, not 200.\nWe think that probably Frank hasn\u2019t answered 72 questions still. If $x = 72$, then $80 - x = 8$.\nSo, the number of unanswered questions is now 40, and number of incorrect answers is 8. The equation now is: $5 \\cdot 72 + (-2 \\cdot 8) + 0 = 232$.\nThis equation is true, meaning the number of correct answers is 72.\n### Level: MEDIUM\n### Science: MATHEMATICS\n### Source: Dalton State College\n### Time: 30 minutes\nI hope you enjoyed this math problem!

        " \nLet $a$ be the number of correct answers.\nThen the number of incorrect answers is $80-a.$ The number of unanswered questions is $200-(a + 80),$ because there are 200 total questions and 80 questions were already answered. \nSo, \n$$5a-2(80-a)+0(200-a-80)=232,$$ which simplifies to\n$$5a-160=232,$$ or \n$$5a=392.$$Dividing by $5$, we have that\n$$a=\\boxed{784\\div5= 78}.$$\n#### Sanity check:\nIn this problem, we are told that Frank answered 80 questions. Let\u2019s make sure that works out in our equation. The equation is \n$$5a-2(80-a)+0(200-a-80)=232.$$ Plugging in 78 for $a$ gives\n$$5(78)-2(80-78)+0(200-78-80)=232.$$\n$$390-2(2)+0(40)=232$$\n$$390-4=232$$\n$$386=232$$ which is probably not true.\nBut, if we plug in 77 for $a$, we get\n$$5(77)-2(80-77)+0(200-77-80)=232.$$\n$$385-2(3)+0(40)=232$$\n$$385-6=232$$\n$$379=232$$ which might be true. We should double-check.\n#### Final answer:\nA possible solution to the problem is that Frank answered $77$ questions correctly.

        " There were 80 questions answered, each correct answers scores 5 points. Not answered questions score 0 points. So we need to check if there are any negative points.\n#### Correct answer counts\nFive for every correct answer, so 5 points * number of correct answers. Zero for unanswered, 0 * number of unanswered. Negative two for incorrect, -2 * number of incorrect.\n#### Points calculation\nTotal 5 * number of correct answers + 0 * number of unanswered - 2 * number of incorrect. = 5 * number of correct answers + (80 - number of correct - number of incorrect) * 0 - 2 * number of incorrect.\n#### Conditions\nThe total number of points is 232. So 5 * number of correct answers + 0 - 2 * number of incorrect. = 232.\n#### Solving number of correct answers\nRearrange the equation. 5 * number of correct answers - 2 * number of incorrect = 232.\n#### Calculation\nDivide both sides by 3. 5/3 * number of correct answers - 2/3 * number of incorrect = 232/3.\n#### Solve the problem\nThis is an algebraic equation. 5/3 * number of correct answers - 2/3 * number of incorrect = 232/3.\nAdd 2/3 * number of incorrect to both sides. 5/3 * number of correct answers = 232/3 + 2/3 * number of incorrect.\nMultiply both sides by 3. 5 * number of correct answers = 232 + 2 * number of incorrect.\nMultiply both sides by 1. 5 * number of correct answers = (232 + 2 * number of incorrect).\nNote: No solutions are required.

Thus $\\displaystyle 36egers.true Further We must now find the number of questions he left unanswered. We can then find the number of questions answered correctly.

We don\u2019t know the numbers Frank answered incorrectly, nor do we know the number of questions Frank left blank.\nLet\u2019s write the total number of correct questions as X. The number of incorrect questions would then be 80 - X. The number of questions left blank would be 200 - 80 = 120 - X. Since we know Frank scored 232 points, that means that 5X - 2(80 - X) + 0 \\cdot (120 - X) = 232.

There are two parts to this formula. First, is the 5(_____) where the score is 5(_____), because each correct answer scored 5 points. So, it must be true that 5(_____) = 5 * (# of correct answers). The other parts are (-2)(_____) for each incorrect answer, and 0(_____ for each question that was not answered. So, we have: 5(_____) + (-2)(_____) + 0(_____) = 5(_____) + (-2)(_____ correct answers) - 2(false answers) + 0(not answered). We know that 232 = 5(_____) + (-2)(_____ correct answers) - 2(false answers). We need to solve this first. Therefore, 5(_____) + (-2)(false answers) - 2(false answers) = 232. (_____) = \\frac{232+2(false answers)}{5}. Let\u2019s solve for (_____) which is the number of correct answers, so that we can solve for false answers(right after we solve for actual answers). Now, Frank answered 80 questions. 80 is equal to _____. Since there are _____ answers, then the total number of questions Frank answered must equal the total number of answers: 80___. Now, 232 + 2(false answers) = 5_____, since there are _____, so (_____) = \\frac{232+2(false answers)}{5}. checking the \u201cweird\u201d part of the formula. Since there are _____ answers, then there are _____ false answers. Therefore, _____ = FALSE ANSWERS. To find the number of false answers, subtract _____ from _____ to get _____ = FALSE ANSWERS. ______ FALSE ANSWERS = ______ FALSE ANSWERS = ______ FALSE.

The maximum score he could have received for 80 questions is 400 (5 for each of 80 questions). Since the actual score was 232, it is clear that the 80 questions included 20 incorrect. So, 40 questions were answered correctly. Since 80 questions are being compared to a maximum of 100, then he would have earned 80 * 5 = 400 points if all of the 80 questions were answered correctly. Thus, he answered 40 questions correctly.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 40. I hope it is correct.  ### Solution:  Frank scored 232 points out of 200 possible points, so he got 32 points (232-200 = 32) For 80 questions, and the minimum score from 80 questions is 0, Frank scored 80 x 5 = 400 if he answered all of the 80 questions correctly. It means that 400 - 232 = 168. So he got 40 questions correct Correctly and rest were incorrect. Final Answer: The final answer is 40. I hope it is correct.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 40. I hope it is correct. Solution explanation? It an be seen that a total of 80 questions were answered, and the total score for 80 questions is 232.

Adding the two equations, we get $5c = 312$, which gives  $c = 312/5 = 62.4$. Since  must be an integer, the only integer value is 62. Then we can substitute 62 back into the equation 62 + i = 80, and get $i = 18$. Then the number of correct answers is 62. The answer is 62.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 62.

Each incorrect question scores $-2$ points, so Frank scored a total of $-2i$ points from the questions he answered incorrectly.  If a question is not answered, then Frank scored $0$ points from it.  Thus, Frank scored $5c-2i$ points in total from the questions he answered.  Altogether, he scored a total of $232$ points.  Therefore, we have the equation:\n$$5c-2i + 0 = 232$$\nSimplifying the equation, we have\n$$5c-2i=232$$\nThis equation can also be written as:\n\\begin{align*}\n5c&=232+2i\\\\\n5c&=4i+232\n\\end{align*}\nWe are also given that the number of questions Frank answered is $80$.

So the remaining 200 - 80 = 120 were questions that he did not answer.\nFor the ones he answered, he scored 5 for every correct answer and -2 for every incorrect answer. So we can say:\n$x$ is the number of correct answers, and $y$ is the number of incorrect answers.\nScore = 5x - 2y.\n5x - 2y = 232\nSince there are only 80 answers from his side, 80 - x is the number of questions he did not answer. Thus, y = 80 - x.\nNow, replace y in the equation:\n5x - 2(80 - x) = 232\nSimplify the equation:\n5x + 160 - 2x = 232\nAdd 2x to both sides:\n7x + 160 = 232\nSubtract 160 from both sides:\n7x = 72\nDivide both sides by 7:\nx = 10\nThus, Frank answered 10 questions correctly. \n### Readout:\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 10.

        " \nLet's define a few variables to make things easier to compute.\nLet $c$ be the number of questions Frank answered correctly.\nThen, let $i$ be the number of questions Frank answered incorrectly.\nThen, let $n$ be the number of questions Frank did not answer.\nWe know that Frank answered a total of $80$ questions, so $c+i+n=80$.\nWe also know that Frank scored a total of $232$ points.\nThe score for each question answered correctly is $5$ points, so a total of $5c$ points.\nThe score for each question answered incorrectly is $-2$ points, so a total of $-2i$ points.\nFinally, the score for each question not answered is $0$ points, so a total of $0n$ points.\nWe can now set up an equation: $5c-2i+0n=232$. Since $c+i+n=80$, we can substitute $80-n-i$ for $n$ in the last equation: $5c-2i+0(80-n-i)=232$. This simplifies to $5c-2i=152$. Subtracting $152$ from both sides, we get $5c-2i-152=0$. Adding $2i$ to both sides gives $5c-152=2i$. Divide both sides by $2$ and multiply the equation by $5$, which gives $\\boxed{25c-760=5i}$.\nBut this is the wrong direction! We need to find out how many questions he answered correctly. So let\u2019s use the information that the total score is $232$ points and Frank answered $80$ questions.\nHow can you use this information to set up a new equation?\nStep 1. Calculate the total points for correct and incorrect answers.\n$$5c-2i=232$$\nThen we can write $i$ in terms of $c$ and subtract $i$ from both sides to get:\n$$5c-2(80-c)=232$$\nSubtracting $6c$ from both sides and multiplying by $5$:\n$$-10c=-112$$Dividing both sides by $-10$ gives us:\n$$5c=112$$So we have:\n$$c=22$$And $c=22$ is the answer!
