        " First, the company needs to pay $\\$1200$in equipment fees.  At this point, the profit is negative (loss). To get a positive profit, it needs to make at least $\\$\\dfrac{1200}{0.50} = 2400$ in sales. However, this is not enough because the profit for the sales of widgets will still be negative.  They will need to make enough sales to get the profit greater than 0.  2400/2.75 = 870 widgets. But they won\u2019t have enough money for the equipment fee, and it will be still a negative profit.  So, they will need some extra widgets sales.  2400/2.75 = 870 and so, 2.75(870+1) = 2397.5 < 2400 and 2.75(870+2) = 2402.5 > 2400. Thus, with 871 widgets, they will make a profit, so the least number of widgets is 871.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 871. I hope it is correct.

There's no guarantee the company can sell all the widgets or that they don't overstock, but profibility is the goal. final CHECK THE WORK! We also need to check that selling 871 widgets results in a nonnegative profit.  The revenue from 871 widgets is 2.75 * 871 = 2397.50.  Since they also need to pay an equipment fee of 1200, their total cost is 0.50 * 870 + 1200 = 1170.  Then, their total profit is 2397.50 - 1170 = 1227.50.  Since this is greater than 0, we can say that the company makes a profit, and we're done. So the final answer is truly 871. ### Explanation: The idea is to find the minimum number of widgets the company needs to sell in order to make a profit.  First, we consider the cost of each widget: $\\$0.50$.  So, after subtracting the cost of 870 widgets, the company has $\\$450$to use towards the equipment fee.  Because we want to find",
        " We first write 1 equation for the total profit. A possible equation could be: $$2.75n - 0.50n - 1200 = p$$ Where p is the profit. Now, the goal is to factor and to remove any common factors from the equation. So, the equation becomes: $$2.25n - 1200 = p$$ Next, to solve the equation, we will need to add 1200 on both sides of the equation. After doing that, we get: $$2.25n = p + 1200$$ Next, we subtract 1200 on both sides, we get: $$2.25n - 1200 = 0$$ Next, we move all the numbers to the right side and we get: $$2.25n = 1200$$ Next, we divide both sides by 2.25, which gives: $$n = 1200/2.25 = 533\\frac{1}{3}$$ We round that to 533.333 (decimal). So the answer is 533 widgets. Final Answer: The final answer is 533. I hope it is correct. Is there are any better way to solve this problem?

What is the least number of widgets the company has to sell in order to make a profit?\nFirst, we find out how much the company has to make in order to break even. The cost to make $n$ widgets is \\$0.50n + $1200. If$0.50n + $1200\\geq$0$, the company will at least break even. Hence, we solve the inequality\n\\begin{align*} 0.50n+1200&\\ge0\\\\ 0.50n&\\ge-1200\\\\ n&\\ge-1200/0.5=-2400. \\end{align*}When$n\\ge-2400$, the company will at least break even. Now, let\u2019s find the least number of widgets the company has to sell in order to make a profit. The profit of$n$widgets is the difference of$0.50n + 1200 and its cost. The profit is:\nP = n(2.75) - 0.50n - 1200\n=1.25n - 1200.\nWe need to find the least number of widgets such that the profit is positive.\n\\begin{align*} 1.25n-1200&\\ge0\\\\ 1.25n&\\ge1200\\\\ n&\\ge1200/1.25=960. \\end{align*}The least number of widgets is$961.$Final Answer: The final answer is 961.

        " First, we have to figure out where the company makes a profit. After paying $\\$1200$in equipment fees, the company will break even if it sells widgets and earns back its costs; that is, if it has costs equal to$\\$1200$. This means it has to sell widgets and earn $\\$2500$, so that it will have$\\$2500+\\$1200=\\$3700$. This is $\\$2500\\\\div\\$0.50=\\boxed{5000.}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 5000. I hope it is correct. 50,000 widgets are required.\n\u2022 $n-2500+0.50x=2750$ $x-2500=2750-2500$ $x=250$ Widgets need to be sold. The number of widgets is 2500 + widgets The number of widgets sold is equal to 2500 + the cost (0.5x) / price of each widget (2.75)\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 250. I hope it is correct.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 250. I hope it is correct. 60,000 widgets are required. The number of widgets must be more than 4126 which is derived from equation 2500/x = 2.25. The number of widgets required is 4127. I hope it is correct. Final Answer: The final answer is 4127. I hope it is correct. 50,000 widgets are required. The number of widgets must be more than 4126 which is derived from equation 2500/x = 2.25. The number of widgets required is 4127.

        "15 First we need to find how much it costs the company to make one widget of this product: The initial cost of the company to make the product is given as 1200 \\$in one-time equipment fees and then it costs $0.50 for each widget it makes. So it becomes: 1200 + 0.50 for a robot. The company wants to know the least number of robots it has to sell in order to make a profit. However, according to our calculations, the company really wants to know the least number of widgets that the company needs to profit. Overall, the income that the company earns is 2.75 times each extra widget it sells. Income to pay is 2.75 for each widget. We need to find how many widgets we need to sell so that the income surpasses the expenditure. Let us add the profit margin of the company. Let x be the x variable for the profit. So, 0.50 x = -1200. So, 0.50 x = -1200, x = -1200 / 0.50, x = -2400. The loss of widgets that the system has to make in order to make a profit is -2400. After that, we need to find the selling price of the widget. 0.50 is the cost for each piece of the graph, and 2.75 is the price for each widget. So, 2.75 is 0.50 more. To find the profit in order to find the quota, let us add x more and more. 2.75 is less than 0.50. Everything here is solved by 0.50. So, the result of the current calculation will be the x result we got.\n### Final answers: The company\u2019s smallest number of widgets for a profit is \\$2400##"
