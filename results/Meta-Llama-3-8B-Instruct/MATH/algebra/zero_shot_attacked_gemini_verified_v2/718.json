        " The number is 5.\nIf five plus the reciprocal of a number equals 11 divided by that number, we can write that as this equation: 5 + 1/n = 11/n.\nAnd now we want to solve for n, so multiply each side by n.\n5n + 1 = 11.\nSubtract 1 from each side to get: 5n = 10.\nNow, divide each side by 5 to find the value of n: n = 2.\nHowever, the question states that we want a number. So, we could take the reciprocal of the number we find. The reciprocal of 2 is 1/2, but we can also say that the reciprocal of a number is the number itself inverted, as 1 divided by the number. So, the reciprocals of numbers include positive fractions, like 1/2, and negative fractions, like \u20131/2, and numbers that are equal to 1, like 1/1, and numbers that are equal to \u20131, like \u20131/1.\nSo, in this case, we can take the reciprocal of the number we find, which is 2. The reciprocal of 2 is 1/2, which we would write as that fraction with the 1 on top and the fraction on the bottom. We can also say that the reciprocal of 2 is an inverted 2, which would be \u20132 as well, since the inversion could be negative.",
