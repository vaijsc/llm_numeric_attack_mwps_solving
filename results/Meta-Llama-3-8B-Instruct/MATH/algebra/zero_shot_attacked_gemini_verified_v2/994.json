        " Let\u2019s try. Without the 3! (which is just the product of the integers 1 through 3), we are left with $6\\sqrt{5}$. Since this is a quotient of two quantities, we need to think of another way to write the terms within. We see that the $2$ in the $3!$ is not multiplying anything, so we can take that out to get $3!(2+\\sqrt{5}/2)$. This multiplicative expression can be written as $(2+\\sqrt{5})(2-\\sqrt{5})$ using the difference of squares identity, $a^2-b^2=(a+b)(a-b)$. This becomes $4+5-2\\sqrt{5}$. So we have $6\\sqrt{5}=\\frac{3!(4+5-2\\sqrt{5})}{2}$. Multiplying this out, we get $\\frac{3!(4+5-2\\sqrt{5})}{2}=12+15-3\\sqrt{5}$. Therefore, $3!(2^3+\\sqrt{5})\\div 2=\\boxed{12+15-3\\sqrt{5}}$. Final Answer: The final answer is 12+15-3\\sqrt{5}. I hope it is correct. ### Not a valid classification \"Concept Review\" does not indicate that you made a mistake.  One of the main points of your simplifying was using the difference of squares identity.  What do you think you could do to help others understand your steps better?  Maybe you could have separated each step a little more?  Or included an equation number so the steps could be refereed back to easily?  Remember your guide question: Explain your answer and how it relates to the question asked.  Another idea is that you could have started with $3!(2^3+\\sqrt{5})$ and explained how you got to $3!(4+5-2\\sqrt{5})$ instead of saying \"this multiplicative expression can be written as $(2+\\sqrt{5})(2-\\sqrt{5})$ using the difference of squares identity\".  Maybe that would help others understand the different steps better. Overall, great job on simplifying the expression!  Just make sure to break down your steps so others can easily follow along. # Face to Face Help? Use your notes or book to review any concepts we haven\u2019t covered. For the example, simplifying",

Multiplying 2 and 3!, we get 12, and multiplying 12 by $2^3+\\sqrt{5}$, we get $12(2^3+\\sqrt{5})$, and dividing this result by 2, we get $\\frac{12(2^3+\\sqrt{5})}{2} = 12(2^3+\\sqrt{5})\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}$. Therefore, the result is $12(2^3+\\sqrt{5})\\cdot\\frac{1}{2} = 12(2^3+\\sqrt{5})\\cdot\\frac{1}{2} = (3)(2)(1)(2^3+\\sqrt{5})\\div 2$, which equals $12(4)+6\\sqrt{5}$, or $48+6\\sqrt{5}$. In the process of simplification, the number 3! appeared, which is the product of 3, 2, and 1, all multiplied together. Finally, dividing both sides of the equation by 2 results in $12(4)+6\\sqrt{5}$, or $48+6\\sqrt{5}$, which is the simplified version of the expression. The expression $3!(2^3+\\sqrt{",
