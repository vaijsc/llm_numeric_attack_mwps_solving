        " First, we take the $8$: $\\frac{(20r^3)(4r^6)}{8r^4} = \\frac{20 \\times 4}{8} \\times \\frac{r^3 \\times r^6}{r^4}$.\nNext, we get rid of the $8$ that is outside the fractions: $\\frac{20 \\times 4}{8} \\times \\frac{r^3 \\times r^6}{r^4} = 10 \\times \\frac{r^3 \\times r^6}{r^4}$.\n### Simplifying the fraction:\n\\begin{align*}\n10 \\times \\frac{r^3 \\times r^6}{r^4} &= 10 \\times \\frac{r^{3+6}}{r^4}\\\\\n&= 10 \\times \\frac{r^9}{r^4}\n\\end{align*}\nNow we need to find the highest exponent of $r$ that appears in the numerator. In this case, it is $9$, so we need to make sure the denominator is $r^9$ or higher so we can cancel $r^{9-4}$ terms. But we can only have $r^4$ in the denominator. That means that $r^{9-4}$ is left in the numerator: $10 \\times \\frac{r^9}{r^4} = 10 \\times r^{9-4} = 10r^5$.\nTherefore, the simplified fraction is $\\boxed{10r^5}$.\nSolution pathway: Simplify $\\frac{(20r^3)(4r^6)}{8r^4}$.\n1.  Cancel the $8$ that is outside the fractions.\n2.  Simplify the fraction by combining the exponent of $r$ in the numerator.\n3.  Cancel terms by subtracting the lower exponent of $r$ from the higher exponent of $r$. \nFinal Answer: The final answer is 10r^5. I hope it is correct.  Hope it is not incorrect.

        " $\\boxed{10r^9}$\nRemember that when you are simplifying a fraction, you can combine terms by multiplying to eliminate the denominator (if one of the values in the denominator is the same as the value in the numerator). In this case, the value of the denominator, $r^4$, is the same as one of the values of the terms in the numerator, $r^6$. So, instead of multiplying $20r^3 \\cdot 4r^6$, add the exponents. The new numerator would be $20r^{3+6}=20r^9$. Simplifying the denominator, the expression becomes $\\frac{20r^9}{8r^4}$. Finally, divide the numerator by the denominator: $$\\frac{20r^9}{8r^4}=\\frac{20}{8}\\cdot\\frac{r^9}{r^4}=\\frac{5r^5}{1}=\\boxed{5r^5}$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 10r^9.
