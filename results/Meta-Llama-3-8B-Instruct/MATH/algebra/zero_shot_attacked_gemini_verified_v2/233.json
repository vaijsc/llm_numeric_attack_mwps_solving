        " 1\nLet us find the value of b. As we have the equation x2 \u2013 2x + 66 = (x + b)2 + c .\n### ",
        " \nLooking at $x^2-2x+66$, we want to transform it into $(x+b)^2+c$, which is $x^2+2bx+b^2+c$. Then, we can equate the coefficients.\nIt gives us two equations: \n$$\\begin{cases}\n1=1+2b\\Rightarrow b=-\\frac{1}{2},\\\\\n-2=-2b\\Rightarrow b=\\frac{1}{2}.\n\\end{cases}$$We can see that $b=-\\frac{1}{2}$. Thus, we substitute it back to the expansion of $(x+b)^2+c$. We get $x^2-2x+66=(x-1/2)^2+c=x^2-x+1/4+c$. Equating the constant terms, we get $66=1/4+c\\Rightarrow c=66-\\frac{1}{4}=\\frac{263}{4}$. Finally, we have $b+c=-\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{263}{4}=\\boxed{\\frac{259}{4}}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\frac{259}{4}. I hope it is correct.",
        " First, we should write $(x+b)^2+c$ in its expanded form.\nExpanded form of $(x+b)^2+c$ is: $$(x+b)^2+c = (x+b)(x+b) + c = x^2 + 2bx + b^2 + c.$$\nComparing this with the original quadratic form, we know that\n$$x^2 + 2bx + b^2 + c = x^2-2x+66.$$\nNow, we can equate the coefficient of $x^2$ (the constant part) to get $0 = 2b^2+c$.\nTherefore, $c = -2b^2$.\nEquality of $x$-coefficients gives $-2 = 2b$.\nAnd, $b = -1$.\nNow that we know $b$, we can use the $c$-equation to find $c$. $$c = -2(-1)^2 = -2(1) = -2.$$\nFinally, $b+c = \\boxed{-3}$.\n### Discussion: The method used here, comparing expanded forms of two functions and simplifying the coefficients, is a very powerful technique. Problem of this type, where we need to write a quadratic of the form $(x+b)^2+c$, always helps us to check coefficients like $x$-coefficients, to identify the simple form of the quadratic.\n### Reference:\nLiao Chun Li (2018).
