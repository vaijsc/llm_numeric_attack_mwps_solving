        "\u00a0Some tips are helpful for solving this question. We have the following:\n1 \u2013 h(x) is the inverse function of f(x). That is, the following holds: h(f(x)) = x and f(h(x)) = x.\n2 \u2013 If f(x) = y then y = h(x). This means if you are paying attention to the function f(x), you will probably see the element x that maps to y and note that h(x) = y.\n3 \u2013 In addition to that, you can think of the inverse function h(x) as a function in the right hand of the equal sign in steps (1) and (2).\nThen you can make a diagram (like a table) with x and y as you need.\nAccording to these 3 steps, we can draw the following diagram.\n200520\nFinally, we will have the following result:\nf(f(10)) = f(5) = 10\nAnswer: f(f(10)) = 10.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 10. I hope it is correct. Figure\u00a01\u00a0is the\u00a0illustration of several important points. Suppose that y = f(x), then h(x) = f^(-1)(x). That is, in (1), a is the function that h(2) does +3 to X.

In the inverse function of the point line, it is a straight line. The inverse function is h(2) = 10. Therefore, f(10) = 5.\nSo, f(f (10)) = f(5) = 2 is the final result. We have determined whether h(10) = 5, which is given by h (10) = 5. If your function is F (x) = y is 5, then the value of your function when the x value of x is equal to.\nNext, we know that h (10) = 5. It is also stated that h (1) = 2.
