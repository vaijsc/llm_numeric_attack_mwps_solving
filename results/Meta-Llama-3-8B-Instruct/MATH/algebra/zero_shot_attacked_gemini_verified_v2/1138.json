        " First, we know $(0,5)$ is a point on the graph of $y=ax^2+bx+c$. So, we can plug $x=0$ and $y=5$ into $y=ax^2+bx+c$ and get:\n$$5 = a(0)^2 + b(0) + c = c$$We can now set $c=5.$\n### ",
        " I am enjoying the solution.\n#### The given information\nWe are given that:\nThe graph of y = a x^2 + b x + c passes through points (0, 5) and (1, 10) and (2, 19).\n#### Find the values of a, b, c\nWe know that: y = a x^2 + b x + c\nSubstitute (0, 5): 5 = c\nSubstitute (1, 10): 10 = a + b + c\nSubstitute (2, 19): 19 = 4a + 2b + c\nWe have 3 equations and 3 unknowns. We can solve them for a, b, c.\n#### Solve for a, b, c\nWe will subtract equation (2) from equation (1): (-4a - b = 5) -> (4a + 2b = 15)\nSubtract equation (2) from equation (3): (3a + b = 6) -> (4a + 2b = 15) -> a = 1, b = 1, c = 5\n#### a + b + c\nWe have: a = 1\nb = 1\nc = 5\na + b + c = 1 + 1 + 5 = 7\n#### The answer is 7.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 7. I hope it is correct.\u00a0@anuj2107\nNote: By the given equation, we got 3 equations and 3 unknowns so the point (0,5) allows us to get the value of c which is 5. The point (1,10) and (2,19) give the values of a and b. Then by solving the system we get the values of a as 1 and b as 1. Then we can simply add a + b + c to get the answer which is 7. I hope that helps. Thanks!\u00a0@anuj2107\nLike @anuj2107\u2019s solution, if you have the given 3 points, you can deduce the values of a, b, and c by substituting the given points into the quadratic equation and solving the algebraic equations obtained. The values of a, b, and c can then be found. @sahpej7265\n@rahulshaw1223 and @itomashk\nFinal Answer",
        " Step 1: If the graph passes through $(0,5)$, then $c=5$.\nStep 2: In order to find $a$ and $b$, let\u2019s substitute $x=1$ and $y=10$ into the equation. Therefore, we have $a+b+c=1^2a+b+5$. Based on the graph passing through $(1,10)$, we get $10 = a+b+5$, or $a+b=5$.\nStep 3: In addition, let\u2019s substitute $x=2$ and $y=19$ into the equation to get $4a+2b+5 = 19$.\nStep 4: After adding the two equations together, we have $5a+3b = 24$, multiplying both side by $a$, $5a^2+3ab=24a$, and factor out $a$ from the left and right sides, we get $a(5a+3b-24)=0$. This implies $a=0,5a+3b=24$, and from $a+b=5$, we find the non-zero solution $a=3, b=2$.\nStep 5: Finally, substituting the values $a=3$, $b=2$, and $c=5$ into $a+b+c$, we find $3+2+5 = \\boxed{10}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 10.
