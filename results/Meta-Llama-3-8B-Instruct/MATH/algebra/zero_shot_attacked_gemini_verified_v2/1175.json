        " First, we rearrange the expression $-a-3b=-23$ to get $$a+3b=23.$$We are told that $a$ and $b$ are consecutive integers, so we can set up the variable $x=a=b-1$, which gives us $$a+3b=(x)+(3)(x+1)=(x)+(3x+3)=4x+3.$$Since $4x+3=23$, we can solve for $x$ to find that $x=5$.

For example, $12$ or $45$ are in this set of elements. Let $p(n)$ denote the number of permutations which contain the minimum number of negative digits. For example, for $n = 5$, $p(n) = 10$. How do we get his $p(n)$?\nLet us define $f(n)$ as the number of negative permutations. Then $p(n) + f(n) = n!$ is the total number of permutations.\nLet us divide the elements into two groups, Group $A$ and Group $B$. Let me explain what these groups are: All permutations in Group $A$ contains an even number of negative digits; Therefore, permutations in Group $B$ must contain an odd number of negative digits. First, we will consider the permutations in Group $B$. We are given that there are $n!$ permutations, and we need to find the number of permutations with an odd number of negative digits. It\u2019s the same as the number of permutations that do not have an odd number of negative digits. So the number of permutations in Group $B$ is $f(n)$. Because there are $n!$ permutations and all are the same number, then $p(n) = n! - f(n)$.\nLet $S :=$ First five positive numbers: $ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5$.\nLet $a :=$ Position of digit 1 in $S$: For example, if $S$ must be $a \\rightarrow 1 \\rightarrow a$.
