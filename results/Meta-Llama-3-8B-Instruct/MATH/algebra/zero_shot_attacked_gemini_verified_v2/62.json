Note that $(x-6)^2=\\left(\\frac{a+\\sqrt{b}}{c}\\right)^2$ and therefore, has no square root.  So, we can only have a factor $x-1$, so that $x-1=\\frac{a+\\sqrt{b}}{c}$.\nNote that the factor $x-1$ contributes an $x-1$ to the polynomial on the left and an $x$ to the right on the right.  Since we want to have an $m$ coefficient in the right-hand side of the equation, we know that $m$ must be $-1$ in the left and $1$ in the right, so in the equation $x+1(1-6)=1$, the factor contributing the $-5$ is $x-6$. Hence, in the form $\\frac{a+\\sqrt{b}}{c}$, we have $c=1$ and $a-6b=5$.  We also know that in the form $x-1=\\frac{a+\\sqrt{b}}{1}$, we have $a=6$ and $\\frac{b}{1}=(6)^2-25=1$.  From here, $b=1$.
