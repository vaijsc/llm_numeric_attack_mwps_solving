        " First, denote the weight of the largest dog as $x$, and the weight of a smaller dog as $y$. The difference between $x$ and $y$ is 20 pounds, so $x = y+20$.\nAnother way of saying this is that $x-y=20$.\nWe know that $x+y+z=385$, where $z$ is the weight of the other smaller dog. Since the two smaller dogs weigh the same, then $z=y$, and so $x+y+y=385$, which simplifies to $x+2y=385$.\nIf we subtract $x-y=20$ from this equation, we get $3y=365$, so $y=365/3=121.67$. So, the two smaller dogs weigh the same, about 121.67 pounds each.\nTo find the weight of the largest dog, we plug in 121.67 to the equation $x=y+20$ and solve for $x$. $\\boxed{x=141.67}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 141.67.

        " The question is a puzzle. It tells us that the three weights are 385, a and b, where a is the bigger one. It tells us that a - b = 20, so we can write a as b + 20, so we can write 385 as b + 20 + b, which is 2b + 20. The question asks us what we have to do to find the largest, which is a, or in this case, b + 20. It gets the weight to an equation with only variable. There is no arithmetic; there\u2019s only one variable.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 130. I hope it is correct.

The first equation is pretty straightforward to work with, while the second equation gives us the relationship we need to write $a$ in terms of $b$ and $c$ , as follows: \\begin{align*} a+b+c&=385\\\\ \\Rightarrow a+b&=385-c=385-c\\\\ \\Rightarrow a&=385-c-b\\text{(make }b\\le c\\text{ and use the first part of this, excluding the case where} b=c\\text{)} \\end{align*} Another way would be , $a=b $ and /or from all difference in these dogs , a is not 0 . We must also have $a=b$ , which might seem a bit less intuitive, but that also is true . Because we are saying they are \"same\" we have $b =c-20 .

        " \nSo the three basset hounds combined weigh $385$ pounds. The two smaller dogs weigh the same. This can be represent using variables as follows:\n$x+x+y=385,$ where $x$ is the weight of the two smaller dogs and $y$ the weight of the largest dog.\nSo $x+x+y=385$ can imply $2x+y=385$\nSince the difference between the larger weight and the smaller weight is $20$, we have $y \u2013 x=20$. This implies that $y = x + 20$.\nNext, substitute the value of y into $2x+y = 385$, to get $2x+x+20=385$\nWe can conclude that $3x=365$\nTherefore, x must be equal to $123$ pounds. To obtain the weight of the largest dog, we can plug this value of x into y = x+20, so y=123+20",

Therefore, we have:\n$$x + x + (x+20) = 385.$$We can now solve for $x$:\\begin{align*}\n3x + 20 &= 385 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 3x &= 365 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x &= 121.666\\dots\n\\end{align*}Since $x$ must equal an integer, we know that the smallest dog must weigh $122$ pounds.  Therefore, the largest dog weighs $122 + 20 = \\boxed{142}$ pounds.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 142. I hope it is correct. ### ",
        " \n    - Step 1:  Identify variables\n    - Identify the variables $x$ and $y$, where $x$ represents the weight of a smaller dog and $y$ represents the weight of a larger dog. Also, $x$\n    is 20 pounds heavier than a smaller dog. The weights of the three basset hounds are $x, x$, and $y$ collectively, and the total weight is 385 pounds.\n    - Step 2: Write the equations\n    - Use the variables identified above to write three equations:\n        - $x+x+y=385$ to represent the total weight\n        - $y-x=20$ to represent the difference between the larger dog and the smaller dogs\n        - $x + x = 2x$ to represent the sum of the smaller dogs, expressing $x$ as a multiple of itself\n    - Step 3: Solve the systems\n    - We can solve the system of equations by substituting the given information. First, substitute the equation $y-x=20$ into the equation $x+x+y=385$. This gives $x+x+20=385$, or $2x+20=385$. From this equation, we can subtract 20 from both sides to obtain $2x=365$. This means that $x=365/2=182.5$ is the weight of a smaller dog.\n    - Step 4: Find weight of largest dog\n    - To find the weight of the largest dog, we subtract the weight of a smaller dog from $y-x=20$: $y=x+20=182.5 + 20 = \\boxed{202.5}$ pounds.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 202.5 pounds.
