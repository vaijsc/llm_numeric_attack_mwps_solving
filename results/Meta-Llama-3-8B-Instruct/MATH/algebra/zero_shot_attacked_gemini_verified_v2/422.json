        " The method above is correct. Here is the answer:\nLet\u2019s write an expression for the area A of the garden:\nA = xy = l w\nwhere x and y are the width and length of the garden, and l and w are the length and width of the garden.\nThe perimeter of the fence is 300 feet, so\n2 (l + w) = 300\nsimplifying this we get\nl + w = 150\nNow, we can use the above expression for the area in terms of l and w:\nA = l * w\nNow we can solve this as an optimization problem. We can use the chain rule to solve this problem. The first derivative of the area with respect to l is\ndA/dl = w + l * dw/dl\nNow we can set this equal to zero:\nw + l * dw/dl = 0\nNow, we can solve for dw/dl:\ndw/dl = -w/l\nNow, we can substitute this into the original expression for the area:\nA = l * w\nNow, we can solve for w in terms of l:\nw = 150 - l\nNow, we can substitute this into the expressions:\nA = l * (150 - l)\nWe can simplify this a bit:\nA = 150l - l^2\nNow, we can take the first derivative of this with respect to l:\ndA/dl = 150 - 2l\nNow, we can set this equal to zero:\n150 - 2l = 0\nNow, we can solve for l:\nl = 75\nNow, we can substitute this into the expression:\nw = 150 - l = 150 - 75 = 75\nNow, we can substituting these values back into the expression:\nA = l * w = 75 * 75 = 5625\nSo, the area of the garden is 5625 square feet.\nWe can check this by looking at the graph of the area. The first derivative of the area with respect to l is positive for l < 75 and negative for l > 75. This means that the area is biggest at l = 75.\nSo, the correct answer is 5625.\nI hope it is correct. Let me know if you have any further questions.",

        "  \nEach side of the rectangle will be represented by the variable `x`. Let's use the equation:\n$$2x+2y=300$$ to solve this\nSo, we are going to divide both sides of the equation by 2:\n$$x+y=150$$\nNow, we want to find the maximum value of `y`, so we are going to differentiate:\n$$dy/dx = 1$$\nTherefore, for the extreme value, we'll let `dy/dx = 0`:\n$$1 = 0$$ for `x`\nSo, `x` should be 0, which is not possible since `x` must be a positive number; therefore, it seems that there's no maximum value.\nBut wait, we are not done. `Let's'` apply the condition of `x+y=150` again. We know that `x > 0` but `x` can be `0+x`: So, `x` cannot be `0`.\nDiscovering that `x+y=150` has no roots. It also has no curves in the first and third quadrants beyond a point because it starts from the negative area and negative length of the rectangle. In addition, there can't be any border with x and y both less than 0. Of course, there can't be the origin for the garden. \nThe fence must entirely enclose the garden. There should be at least one y-side and one x-side side. \nAccording to this, it means for any y more than `150`, there is another possible solution.\nFigure out what the problem would be. `Mistakenly`, we should consider y should be less than `150`, but it `means Nothing`.\n`Any max area means at maximum y`, but if y exceeds `150`, you'll discover the garden is larger with fewer sides, since the fenc3 means fencing means the garden must take `hardly necessarily two sides` of the sides.\nExample: x=40, y=110\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 8800.

The area is given by:\nArea = l * w \nExpressing w as a function of l:\nl = 150 - w \nArea = l * w \nNow we can express the area as a function of w:\n150w - w^2\nTake the first derivative of the area with respect to w. The first derivative represents the slope of the area function at that instant.\nWe would like to find the maximum area by analyzing the slope if we were to change w at a given w. To achieve that, we would set the first derivative of the area with respect to w to zero.\nFirstly, differentiate the given area:\nArea = 150w - w^2 \nThe first derivative (slope) is then given by:\n150 \u2013 2w \nWe want the slope at some w to be zero, so:\n150 - 2w = 0 \n2w = 150 \nw = 75 \nUsing this value of w in the equation l = 150 - w \nL = 150 - 75 \nL = 75 \nSo the length and width are 75 feet each.\nThe maximum area is then:\nArea = 75 * 75 = 5625 square feet\ufffd\ufffd \nThe maximum area of this garden is 5625 square feet.\n### Conclusion:\nIn conclusion, given the constraint on the perimeter, it was possible to determine the maximum area of the rectangular garden by using the condition that the perimeter is 300 feet. The maximum area was found by solving an optimization problem using the first derivative of the area, which led to finding the critical point.

        " I can find the maximum area by maximizing the length and width, which will maximize the area of the garden.\nTo find the length and width, we can create two unknowns: l and w such that l + w = 300 and l \u00d7 w = area.\nWe want to maximize the area (l \u00d7 w) given the constraint of the total fencing (l + w = 300).\nTo do this, we differentiate the constraint equation with respect to l, which gives w = -1 when we solve for w. This means that as l increases, w decreases.\nThe problem now converts to finding the value of l that gives the maximum area. To do this, we need to find the value of l that gives the maximum value of l \u00d7 w.\nLet\u2019s differentiate l \u00d7 w with respect to l, which gives w. Substituting w = 300 - l, we get: d(l \u00d7 w)/d(l) = d[(300-l) \u00d7 l]/d(l) = 300 - 2l.\nSetting this equal to 0, we get 300 - 2l = 0, which gives l = 150.\nThis is the point where the area reaches its maximum, as the rate of change of area with respect to l is 0.\nSo, l = 150, and w = 300 - l = 150, which gives a garden of 150 feet by 150 feet, with an area of 22,500 square feet. This is the maximum achievable area.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 22,500 square feet. I hope it is correct.  Tom is building a rectangular garden from 300 feet of fencing.

        "\u00a0Please find the correct solution.\nLet\u2019s graph it on an xy-coordinates so we can better see how to solve it:\n### Solution: We first need to determine the maximum area.\nThe amount of fencing we have is 300 feet. Let\u2019s use x and y for the dimensions of the garden.\nWith these dimensions, we have the perimeter of the garden that must include the fencing:\n2x + 2y = 300\nTo make it less confusing, let\u2019s subtract 2 from both sides:\n2x + 2y - 2 = 298\nNow, divide both sides by 2 to make it simpler:\nx + y = 149\nThis way, we have an equation where we have found the relationship between x and y. It is probably easier to solve using substitution. We can turn this expression into a function using one of the sides as the dependent variable. For no reason other than simplicity, let\u2019s solve for x:\nx = 149 - y\nNow that we have an equation for x, we can get an equation for the area of the garden:\nArea = x * y\nSubstitute x:\nArea = (149 - y) * y\nThis function is in terms of y. Now we want to know what value of y gives the maximum area. To find that, we need to take the derivative of the function, set it to zero, and solve for y.\nLet\u2019s do that:\nd/dy Area = d/dy[(149 - y) * y]\nMultiplying the derivative outside the brackets:\nd/dy Area = (149)-(y * 1) + (y*(-1))\nSimplifying:\nd/dy Area = 149 - y - y\nBring the y terms to the other side:\nd/dy Area = 149 - 2y\nNow we set the derivative equal to 0 and solve for y:\n0 = 149 - 2y\nAdd 2y to both sides:\n2y = 149\nDivide by 2:\ny = 74.5\nSince you can\u2019t have a 0.5 length, the maximum area will be approximated by rounding y to 74. This was used for simplicity, as you could also use the decimal value and end up with an integer length. For example, x would be 75 and y would be 74.\nArea = (149 - y) * y\nSubstitute the value of y:\nArea \u2248 (149 - 74)",
        " \nThe maximum area can be achieved when the two sides (length) of the rectangle are equal to $\\frac{300}{3}=100$ feet.\nThen, the width of the rectangle becomes 100 feet because we have 300 feet of fencing. The area would be $100\\cdot100=10000$ square feet.\nThe key insight here is to find the length of two sides which would make the area maximum given the 300 feet of fencing. Think of this in a more general sense - for any closed system, whether physical or not, it is advantageous to distribute the material evenly. This way, one achieves the maximum use or efficiency. Thus, we have space to evenly distribute the 300 feet around four sides of the rectangle, without creating a shortfall, and maximizing the enclosed area. This property is a characteristic of a maximize problem.\nHowever, to be certain, we could use calculus to solve this problem as well.\nThe function $y=x\\cdot\\sqrt{300-2x}$ would describe the area of the rectangle using the given constraint that the fencing must entirely enclose the garden.\nFind the critical points of this function. Then, verify if the output satisfies the constraints.\nThe differentiation will give\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\left(x\\cdot\\sqrt{300-2x}\\right)=\\sqrt{300-2x}-x\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{300-2x}}\\cdot 2=-\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{300-2x}^3}\nSetting the derivative to zero and solving for $x$ gives\n$\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{300-2x}^3}=0$\n$x=0$ or $\\sqrt{300-2x}=0$ \nAs the square root of an expression cannot be zero, we ignore that solution and consider the other case:\n$\\sqrt{300-2x}=0$\n$x = 150$ \nThe width and length are both 100 feet, with the longest side parallel to each other for symmetry, which is similar to our previous result.",

Understanding this problem is crucial to solving it.\nTo maximize the area of this garden, we want to make the widest garden we can, but still be able to enclose it entirely with 300 feet of fencing.\nSo we are essentially trying to find the maximum area possible for this garden.\nLet x be the length of the garden and y be the width. We know that the perimeter is 300, since there are 300 feet of fencing.\nThe perimeter is the distance around the garden, and it is the sum of the lengths of each side of the garden. In this case, the perimeter is 300 feet.\n#### formula\nx + 2y = 300",
        " The maximum area of the garden when Tom uses all the fencing. \n### Approach:\nThe fencing Total distance provided is enough to enclose a rectangle with length L and width W.\nThe fencing will be made up of:\n- 2 sides with length L (say x) meters;\n- 2 sides with length W (say y) meters;\nThe total length of fence (F) equals 2x + 2y.\nThe area of the rectangle is A = xy.\nThe total fences will be equal to the given fencing provided:\nF = 2x + 2y = 300.\nThis means that x + y = 150.\nNext step: Let\u2019s have some guess and check with some more trial solutions. Let\u2019s guess x = 100. Based on that length, the remaining length of the fence (150 - 100 = 50) can create y.\nHere we have the values x = 100 and y = 50. Let\u2019s calculate the area of the garden:\nA = xy = 100 * 50 = 5000 square meters.\nWe prove that area is actually max by increasing y in a small but possible small value, For example, x = 101 and y = 49. Area will be A = 101 * 49 = 4969. Therefore, A is the maximum area.\nFinal answer:\n### 5000 square meters",
        " This is dimensional analysis problem.\nLet's start by writing the whole problem statement.\nWe have 300 feet of fencing. We want to maximize the area of the rectangular garden.\nWe can start with the formula for the area of a rectangle: A = length * width.\nNow, let's say the width is w and the length is l. The perimeter (the total length of the fencing) is 2*l + 2*w = 300.\nNow, we can write an equation: A = l*w.\nNext, we need to maximize the area. We can do that by taking the derivative of the area with respect to either w or l and setting it equal to zero.\nThe derivative of the area with respect to w is dA/dw = l. The derivative of the area with respect to l is dA/dl = w.\nSetting either of these derivatives equal to zero, we get l = 0 or w = 0. But this can't be the case, because w and l have to be positive.\nSo, we set the derivative equal to zero, but we also make sure that w and l are positive. This gives us the maximum area.\nNow, let's find the width and length. We can do this by dividing the perimeter equation by 2 and then solving for w:\n300/2 = 150 = 2*l + 2*w\n- 2*l = 300 - 2*w\nw = 75 and l = 75\nSo, the maximum area is:\nA = l*w = 75*75 = 5625 square feet.```\n###  Arc Length and Surface Area of Sphere\nWe can find the arc length of a given angle $\\theta$ on the surface of a sphere with radius R using the formula $s = \\theta*R$.\nNow, we want to find the surface area of the sphere. The surface area of a sphere is given by the formula: $A = 4\\pi*R^2$.\nNow, it's also very important to note that there is also a formula for the surface area in terms of the arc length $s$, which is given by: $A = \\frac{s^2}{4\\pi*R}$.\nNow, can we figure out the maximum value of the surface area? The maximum value of the surface area is given by $A_{max} = 4\\pi*R^2$ which is when $s = 2\\pi*R$.\nSo, the maximum",
        " The area of a rectangle is given by $A = l w$, where $l$ is the length and $w$ is the width. Since Tom has 300 feet of fencing and it must enclose the garden, if the length is $l$, the width must be $300 - 2 l$. The maximum area occurs when $\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}A}{\\mathrm{d}l} = 0$, so we get $2 w + l \\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}w}{\\mathrm{d}l} = 0$, which simplifies to $2 (300 - 2 l) - 2 l (2) = 0$. Therefore, $600 - 4 l = 0 \\Rightarrow l = 150$. When $l = 150$, $w = 300 - 2(150) = 0$. This doesn\u2019t make sense, but if $l = 100$, $w = 300 - 2(100) = 200$. Thus, the maximum area is $A = 100 \\cdot 200 = \\boxed{20,000}$ square feet.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 20,000. I hope it is correct."
