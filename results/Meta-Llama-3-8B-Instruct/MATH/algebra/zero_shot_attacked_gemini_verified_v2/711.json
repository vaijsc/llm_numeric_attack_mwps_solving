        " Let us label grandfather's age as G and Andrew's age as A . We know that G = 8A. This gives us an equation. Since Andrew\u2019s grandfather was 86 when Andrew was born, we can write his current age as G + A. Now we have three quantities: Andrew's current age ( A), Andrew's age at birth ( A), and grandfather's current age (G + A). In particular, we are trying to solve for Andrew's current age (A). We can write the equations from the given information as follows:\n\\begin{pmatrix} A \\\\ A \\\\ \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 8 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} G \\\\ A \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 86 \\end{pmatrix}\n### ",

        " \nWhere $x$ denotes Andrew's age and $y$ denotes his grandfather's age, we can write:\n$$y=8x, 86+y=x$$\nWe will use substitution. First, substitute $y-86$ for $x$:\n$$y=(y-86)+86$$\nCombine like terms:\n$$y=y$$\nIt seems we have gotten nowhere! We must be missing something. Notice that $y$ is $8x$ and that $y-86$ is also $x$. We're told that $y-86$, which is $x$, is also $8x$. So the only way this could be true is if $x=86/7$ or simply 12 (their ages in 12ths of a year).\nWe have $x+y=86+8x$, which simplifies to:\n$$x+y=8x+86$$\nSubtracting $8x$ from both sides, we have:\n$$x+y-8x=86$$\nFactoring, we have:\n$$-7x+y=86$$\nRecall that $y=86+y$, which gives $y-86=x$. Since $y=8x$, we have $8x-86=x$. We can then subtract $x$ from both sides and multiply by $-1$:\n$$7x=86$$\nDividing both sides by 7, we find $x=\\boxed{12}$, which is Andrew's age now.\nSo now you know that Andrew is 12 years old. His grandfather was 86 years old when Andrew was born, because we know that Andrew's age is eight times his grandfather's age. Andrew's age times his grandfather's age is always 86. It's not too complicated after all! The answer is 12.Done. I hope it is correct. Please let me know if there is anything wrong. ",

If Andrew's grandfather is 8 times older than him, that means, 86 = 8 * age of Andrew when he was born. \n### 86 / 8 = 10.75 (round to 11)\n3. So, the age of Andrew when he was born is 11 years old.\n4. Therefore, the age of Andrew now is 11 + (current year - the year Andrew was born).\nWe can calculate the current year - the year Andrew was born using subtracting the birth year from the current year.

        " 7\nIf Andrew's grandfather is 8 times as old as Andrew, let g be his grandfather's age, and a be Andrew's age. We are given that g - a = 86. We are also given that g = 8a, so we set these two equal to each other to get (8a) - a = 86. Rearranging, we get 7a = 86, and dividing both sides by 7 we get a = 12. So Andrew is 12 now. The answer is 12. [My mistake, 7 is not the correct answer]\n----------------------\nCheck my understanding:\n1. If Andrew's grandfather's age is 8 times Andrew's age, then g = 8a, where g is the grandfather's age and a is Andrew's age.\n2. We know that g - a = 86, because we know that the grandfather's age when Andrew was born is 86.\n3. We can set g = 8a and substitute it in the equation g - a = 86. This gives us 8a - a = 86, or 7a = 86.\n4. Solving for a, we get a = 86/7 = 12.33, so Andrew is approximately 12 years old.\n5. Since we can't have a fraction of a year old, Andrew is 12 years old.\nIs my understanding correct? Yes, my understanding is correct. The correct answer is 12.
