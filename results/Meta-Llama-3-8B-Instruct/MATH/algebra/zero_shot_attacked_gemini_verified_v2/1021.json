I hope it is correct. 0 Solving for $\\frac{x}{z}$:\nAlso, we have that $\\frac{5}{2} y = 12z$ and $y = \\frac{12z}{2.5} = 4.8$ (divide both sides by 2.5), so $x = 2 \\cdot 4.8 = 9.6$.\nTherefore, $\\boxed{\\frac{x}{z} = 2}$. I hope it is correct. 1 Solving for $\\frac{x}{z}$:\nWe have the following system of equations:\n\\begin{align*}3x &= 8y \\\\ 5y &= 12z\\end{align*}\nWe can solve this system step by step. First, let\u2019s substitute $y$ in terms of $z$ from the second equation to the first equation, so the system becomes:\n\\begin{align*}3x &= 8 \\cdot \\frac{12z}{5} \\\\ 5y &= 12z\\end{align*}\nSimplifying the first equation gives:\n\\begin{align*}3x &= 24 \\cdot \\frac{z}{5} \\\\ 5y &= 12z\\end{align*}\nNow, we can solve for $x$ in the first equation:\n\\begin{align*",
        " We find that $\\frac{x}{z}$ is \\boxed{\\frac{8}{15}}.\nWe want to find $\\frac{x}{z}$ in terms of $x$, $y$, and $z$.  This means we will only be using given information.\n1. 3x = 8y \\\\\nx = \\frac{8y}{3}\n2. 5y = 12z \\\\\ny = \\frac{12z}{5}\n3. substitute y in the first equation: \\frac{8}{3}y = 8 y\n8y = 3x\nThis tells us that $\\frac{x}{z}$ equals $\\boxed{\\frac{8}{15}}.$ The final answer is: \\frac{8}{15}.
