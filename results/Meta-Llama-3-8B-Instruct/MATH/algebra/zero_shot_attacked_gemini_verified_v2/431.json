The rocket has a promising future in space exploration and could take humans beyond the moon and even to Mars by the 2030s (https://www.nasa.gov/subject/5515/space-launch-system).\nThe situation is still in the planning phase as of 2023, with several missions planned that include exploring the moon, asteroids, and even sending humans to Mars. However, due to the complexity of the project, the timeline is uncertain and could change over time.\n        sighs ).\nOne of the challenges the project faces is the cost, and it could be in the tens of billions of dollars each time a rocket is launched. Another challenge is incorporating new technology while ensuring safety for the astronauts. In addition, the rocket must be able to withstand the extreme temperatures and harsh conditions of deep space.\nDespite these challenges, NASA is optimistic about the potential of SLS and plans to continue testing and refining the rocket to ensure it is ready for future missions.\nNow I'm trying to find the answer: What is 20% of 50% of 80? \nWell, according to my math, \nFirst, 50% of 80 = 0.5 x 80 = 40\nThen, 20% of 40 = 0.2 x 40 = 8\nSo the answer is 8!
