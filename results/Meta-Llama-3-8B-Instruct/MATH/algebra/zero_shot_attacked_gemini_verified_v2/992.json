Since we know that $7a + 2b = 0,$ we can subtract $7a$ from both sides to obtain $2b = -7a.$ Since $b$ and $a$ are both integers, this means that $b$ is an integer that is half of a multiple of $7$ that is negative. The smallest positive integer that is half of a multiple of $7$ that is negative is $-3$ (this is because $-3$ is the smallest possible positive multiple of $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 7 = 3.5$).\nSubstituting in $b = -3,$ we can find the value of $a$: \\begin{align*}\n7a + 2b &= 0 \\\\\n7a + 2(-3) &= 0 \\\\\n7a &= 6 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow a &= \\frac{6}{7}\n\\end{align*}We want to know what integer value of $a$ is closest to this value.

To find the greatest possible value of $a$, we have to find $b$, and then find the maximum value of $a$.\nFrom the fact that $7a + 2b = 0$ and $ab = -10$, we can subtract $ab$ from both sides of the first equation to obtain $7a + 2b - ab = 0 - ab,$ and factor to get $7a + 2b(1-a) = 0.$ Factoring $2$ from $2b(1-a)$ gives us $7a + 2b(1-a) = 2b(1-\\frac{1}{2}a)$, and factoring $2$ from $7a$ gives us $2(3.5a),$ which equals $2b(1-\\frac{1}{2}a).$ This equality occurs when $3",

I hope it is correct. I need to ask you a question: Can I solve this using Elimination and Substitution method? does it avoid any possibility of getting wrong? Yes, I can use the Elimination method to solve this. Here are the steps:\n1. Multiply the two equations by necessary multiples such that the coefficients of $b$ in the two equations is the same (0 in this case).\n2. Add the two equations to eliminate $b$ and obtain an equation with $a$.\n3. Substitute the expression for $b$ from Step 1 into one of the original equations to solve for $a$.\nLet\u2019s do it!\n### Solution:\nFirst, let\u2019s multiply the first equation by $2$ and the second equation by $7$.\n\u2022 $2(7a + 2b = 0) \\Rightarrow 14a+4b = 0$\n\u2022 $7(ab = -10) \\Rightarrow 7a(-10)=70a=-10$\nNow, add the above two equations to get, $14a+70a=-10+4b\\Rightarrow 84a=-10+4b$\nNow, to eliminate $b$, multiply the above equation by $2$ and subtract it from the first equation, we get,\n$(7a + 2b = 0)-2(84a=-10+4b)\\Rightarrow7a + ",
