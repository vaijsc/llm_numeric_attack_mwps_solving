        " \nWhen simplifying the polynomial 6(x - 4) + 2(x^2 - x + 7) - 5(x - 1),\nwe will follow the rules of simplifying algebraic expressions:\nConstant terms will be combined. \nTerms that have the same variable will be combined.\n1. Distrubute the constants to each term within the parentheses:\n6(x - 4) = 6x - 24\n2(x^2 - x + 7) = 2x^2 - 2x + 14\n-5(x - 1) = -5x + 5\nTotal: 6x - 24 + 2x^2 - 2x + 14 - 5x + 5\n2. Combine the constant terms: 6x - 24, -2x, 5\nTotal: 2x^2 - x - 19\nSo the constant coefficient is -19. \n### Alternative way: \nAlternatively, you could look at the constant terms of each expression and add them together.\nConstant terms: 6(x - 4) = -24; \nConstant terms: 2(x^2 - x + 7) = 14; \nConstant terms: -5(x - 1) = 5\n### Final Answer:\nThe constant coefficient is -19.

Then, I was asked to 'Find the constant coefficient when the polynomial 6(x - 4) + 2(x^2 - x + 7) - 5(x - 1) is simplified.'

        " After simplifying the polynomial, we get 6(x \u2013 4) + 2(x^2 - x + 7) - 5(x \u2013 1). Distribute the constants.\n### 6(x \u2013 4) = 6x \u2013 24 because a(k \u2013 d) = ak \u2013 ad\n### So, the expression becomes: 6x - 24 + 2(x^2 - x + 7) - 5(x \u2013 1).\n### Now, distribute the other constants:\n### Distributing the 2: 2(x^2) = 2x^2. If we distribute it with the term \u201c-x\u201d, we get -2x. And distribute with the term \u201c+7\u201d as 14. So now the expression becomes: 6x - 24 + 2x^2 - 2x + 14.\n### Distributing the negative 5: Distributing it over \u201c(x \u2013 1)\u201d which is the same as distributing it over the entire term \u201cx \u2013 1\u201d: -5x + 5 (Here, 5 represents the constant -5).\n### Combine all the constants and variables:\n### Combining 6x and -2x, since these are like terms, together we get: 4x. Combining -24 and 5, we get: -19. And combining 2x^2 and 14, we get 2x^2 + 14.\n### So, the simplified polynomial is 4x + 2x^2 + 14 - 19.\n### Combine the constant part: 2x^2 + 4x - 5 (which is the answer).\n### Or, simplify further: 2x^2 + 4x - 5.\n### We are asked to find the constant coefficient.\n### The constant coefficient in polynomial is the number which is not multiplied by any variable.

In this case, it seems that the instruction only requires simple expansion and grouping of like terms, so the final answer is indeed 1.  Nevertheless, I will provide a concise example of binomial expansion to illustrate a more advanced level of polynomial manipulation.  For instance, if the instruction had asked to expand (2x + 1)(3x - 2), the solution would be: (2x + 1)(3x - 2) = 6x^2 - 4x + 3x - 2  = 6x^2 - x - 2.  The constant coefficient would then be -2.  More advanced algebra techniques, such as FOIL, can be used to expand binomials with higher powers or more complex expressions.  Fortunately, this instruction only required simple expansion and grouping of like terms, resulting in a constant coefficient of 1. I hope this note provides additional clarity and support for advanced algebraic techniques.  Thank you for your engagement! 20 more characters...  Your exercise is a success!
