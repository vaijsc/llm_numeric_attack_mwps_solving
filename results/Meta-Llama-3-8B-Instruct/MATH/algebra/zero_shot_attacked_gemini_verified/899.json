        " $\\boxed{(-13/3,-1)}$\nLet's think step by step.\nSince the absolute value function gets rid of the negative sign, let's think $\\frac{1}{5}|9+2a|<5$ is the same as $|9+2a|<25$. Now, $|x|<a$ means $-a<x<a$. In this case, we can set $a=25$ and we know the expression is true when $-a<9+2a<a$, which simplifies to $-25<9+2a<25$. Subtracting 9 from each part, we get $-34<2a<16$. Finally, dividing both parts by 2 gives us $\\boxed{(-13/3,-1)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $(-\\frac{13}{3},-1)$. I hope it is correct. 15.

        " #### Let\u2019s think step by step.\nThe absolute value of $9+2a$ is positive since the absolute value of a quantity is always positive or zero. So, we can add 5 to both sides without changing the inequality sign and the right-hand side becomes 10.\n### ",
        " The absolute value function sends its first argument to its distance from zero, regardless of whether it is positive or negative. Thus,\n\\begin{align*} \\frac{1}{5}|9+2a| &< 5\\\\ \\Rightarrow \\quad |9+2a| &< 25\\\\ \\Rightarrow \\quad 9+2a &< 25 \\mbox{ and } 9+2a > -25\\\\ \\Rightarrow \\quad 2a &< 16 \\mbox{ and } 2a > -16\\\\ \\Rightarrow \\quad a &< 8 \\mbox{ and } a > -8. \\end{align*}\nSince we know that $a > -8$, we do not need to worry if $a = -8.000001$. This is because the absolute value function simply picks up the distance from $0$, and it does not matter whether we look at $0-8.000001 = -8.000001$ (and it does not matter that it is the opposite of what the answer line says).\nSo the solution space is $\\boxed{(-8, 8)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is (-8, 8).

        " Let's think step by step.\nFirst, let\u2019s focus on the absolute value part $|9+2a|$. It must be positive, otherwise the whole expression wouldn\u2019t make sense. Looking at the inequality, we see that $9+2a$ can be positive or negative because the absolute value deal with that.\nThe inequality is $<5$, so it means that we have a small value compared to $5$.\nWe now know $|9+2a|$ is positive, and $9+2a$ can be either positive or negative. But, remember, the goal is to satisfy the inequality.\nSay $9+2a$ is positive. Then the inequality is $\\frac{1}{5}(9+2a)<5$, $18+4a<25$, $4a<7$, $a<\\frac{7}{4}$. It is a line in the positive quadrant.\nNow, let\u2019s say $9+2a$ is negative. In that case, the inequality becomes $\\frac{1}{5}(-9-2a)<5$, $-18-4a<25$, $-4a>-7$, $\\boxed{-7< a}$.\nSo, graphing the two lines, we get $a\\in\\left(-\\infty,-\\frac{7}{4}\\right)\\cup\\left(\\frac{7}{4},\\infty\\right)$.
