        " We will find the $x$-coordinates at which the line $y = -3$ intersects $y = x^2 - 8x + 7$, and then we will add these $x$-coordinates to get the sum.

        " \nWe will use the fact that $x^2 - 8x + 7 = -3$. In this equation, $x^2 - 8x + 7 - (-3) = 0$, and we can write this rewritten equation as $x^2 - 8x + 10 = 0$. At this point, we have a quadratic equation with no $(y)$ term and where $c=10$.\n#### Method 1:\nFirst, it\u2019s helpful to factor the quadratic equation $x^2 - 8x + 10 = (x - a)(x - b) = 0$ where $ab = 10$. Therefore, we can solve for $a$ and $b$:\n\\begin{align*}\na + b &= 8, \\\\\nab &= 10. \\\\\n\\end{align*}\nSince we can factor $ab = 10$ in $ab = 1*10 = 2*5 = 10*1 = 10$, we can find $(a,b)$ values for the factorization: $a + b = 8$ gives that $(a,b) = (a,8-a)$ or $(8-a,a)$. Subbing in $ab = 10$:\n$\\qquad \\qquad \\quad$(1) $a*(8-a) = 10$ $\\Longrightarrow \\qquad \\qquad$(2) $10 - a^2 = 10$ $\\Longrightarrow \\qquad \\qquad$(3) $a^2 = 0$ $\\Longrightarrow \\qquad \\qquad$(4) $a = 0$\nSimilarly, substituting $8-a$ into (2) and we get $0 = 10$ which is false. Thus, $(a,8-a) = (0,8)$.\nSo, the roots of $x^2 - 8x + 10 = 0$ are $x = 0$ and $x = 8$ (this is a double root). Therefore, we get the equation $x^2 - 8x + 7 = -3$.\n### Method 2:\nSince $x^2 - 8x + 10 = 0$ has no constant term, we can write it as $x^2 - Ax + 10 = 0$ and then use the quadratic formula $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}",

Then if we let $y=-3$ this equation becomes $x^2-8x+4=0$. We can factor this equation as $(x-2)^2-4=0$. Then, by taking the square root of each side we get $\\sqrt{(x-2)^2}=2$. Then squaring again, we get $x-2=2$. Then $x=4$, so the first point is $(4,-3)$.\nThen if we use the $x-2$ ($x$ minus $2$) formula with the -1 instead of the +1 then we get $x-2=-2$ and $x=0$, so the other point is $(0,-3)$.\nThen we can add $4+0$ to get $4$ so the sum of the x-coordinates of the two points is 4.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 4.

The solution to that problem is $x = \\boxed{2 + 5 = 7}$.\nThey have, haven, tela money! I AM. What is the sum of the $x$-coordinates of these two intersection points, and so on. We also did that in this equation.\nSimplifying gives you, and simplifying gives you. So, and therefore. The sum of the $x$-coordinates of the two intersection points is $x(2 - 5)$.\nThanks for this problem. Then, do you understand this simple $x$?  You can use what you know about and solve for . So,  = =.\nLet me know if you need help again. So, the answer is $x$ times  and you can see that your answer does make sense here. Is there anything else you don\u2019t understand?)! Not really. Have you got any other problems like this? Do"
