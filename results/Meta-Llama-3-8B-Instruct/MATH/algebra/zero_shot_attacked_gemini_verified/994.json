        " We have $3!(2^3+\\sqrt{5})\\div 2$. The \u2018!\u2019 symbol means factorials in this case, and when we raise a positive integer to the power of an integer, we multiply that integer a number of times equal to the power. The factorial 3! means 3 times 2. So $3!=(1)(2)(3)=6$. Let\u2019s think of 6 = \\frac{6}{1}$. Thus we have $\\frac{6}{1}$ (2^3 + \\sqrt{5}) \\div 2$.
