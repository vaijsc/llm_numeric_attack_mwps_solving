Mr. Wrench is charging 265 dollars for 5 hours, so we know that we have n + 5x = 265. 4.  From Step 2, we know that 1x = 97 - n. 5.  We substitute that into Step 3: n + 5* (97-n) = 265 6.  6*n = 260, so n = 43. 7.  Now our two equations are: 43 + x = 97 and 43 + 5x = 265. 8.  We solve for x by subtracting 43 from the second equation, then subtracting 43 from the first: 2x = 222 and x = 111. 9.  Now we know n = 43 and x = 111. 10. We can write our equation for the eight-hour job as: 43 + 8*111. 11. We multiply, and our answer is \\boxed{\\$ 943}.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 943.

I let the cost of the one-hour repair job be $x$ and the cost of the five-hour repair job be $5x$. Then, using these, I can make an equation to solve for $x$. $$x+42=97, \\ \\ 5x+42=265$$ To solve for $x$, I subtracted $42$ from the first equation and subtracted it from the second equation. This gives the following: $$x=55, \\ \\ 5x=223$$ Then, I divided the second equation by $5$, which gives me $x=223/5=44.6$. The solution to the word problem is that the repairman charges $55$ dollars for the one-hour repair job. When it costs the customer $\\ 270. Rocky Needlers 38 1 ID number ",
        " \nMr. Wrench charges $N$ dollars for coming out to the house. The charges he makes for different job lengths will be $$N+kx$$where $k$ is the number of hours.  In the first job, $k = 1$, so we can set up the equation $$N+1x=97.$$ In the second job, $k = 5$, so we can set up the equation $$N+5x=265.$$Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get $$(N+5x)-(N+1x)=265-97\\Rightarrow 4x=168\\Rightarrow x=42.$$ Plugging this value of $x$ back into the first equation, we get \\begin{align*}\nN+42&=97\\\\\nN&=97-42=55.\n\\end{align*} Therefore, Mr. Wrench charges $\\$55$for coming out, and he charges$\\$42$ per hour.

I hope it is correct. ### 11/27 15:48, 2021: So, if x represents number of dollars per hour and N represents number of dollars for coming out to house, then N + x represents the cost for one hour, and this equals 97. Then for five hours, we have N + 5x = 265. Now subtract N from both sides, and we have 5x = 265 - N. Now we plug in N + x = 97 to find x, which is 98 - N. Then if we substitute this into 5x, we have 5(98-N) = 265 - N, and then we can expand out the parentheses and isolate N. I do not know how to put in equations here, so please let me explain in words. In final step, we will get equation as N = 270. Putting this back into N + x, we will get x = 95. It seems that$95$per hour, plus$270$certain cost, is what Mr. Wrench charges. Since we know which is$95$, we can figure out the eight-hour cost, which will be $8 \\cdot 95 + 270 =\\boxed{380}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 380. I hope it is correct. I hope it is correct.

        " For each plumbing repair job, Mr. Wrench charges $\\$N$for coming out to the house plus$\\$x$ dollars per hour that he works at the house. He charged $\\$97$for a one-hour repair job and$\\$265$ for a five-hour repair job. This tells us thatwhen he comes to the house, he charges$\\$N$, and then he charges $\\$x$for each hour he works. Then,$\\$97 = N + x$ is the equation for a one hour repair job. $\\$97 = N + x$ when$x = 97 - N. This tells us that the distance from$\\$97$ that he charges for the second hour is $x = N + x$. If he comes out for a five-hour repair job and he charges $\\$97$ for coming out, then to get back far enough from$\\$97$ to get to a multiple of $x$, he will need to charge $\\$N\\$, so he will need to charge $\\$N + 4x$.

        " In this question, N represents the one-time payment for Mr. Wrench to come to the house. This is merely an expense and will not have any impact on the problem. It is just a distraction.\nx represents the hourly wage for Mr. Wrench. This is the key part of the problem. Let N be a certain non negative integer. Then after we divide 265 by 5, we will get N + 5x. Adding N and 97, we will get N + (5x + 1). Therefore, N + 5x = 265, which gives 5x = 265 - N. Adding N to both sides of the equation, we will get (N + 5x). Now substitute 250 for N and we will get 265.",
        " First, we want N plus the cost of 1 hour, which is 97.\n### ",
        " For each plumbing repair job, Mr. Wrench charges $N$ dollars for coming out to the house plus $x$ dollars per hour that he works at the house. He charged $\\$97$for a one-hour repair job and$\\$265$ for a five-hour repair job.yte second we find the value of $N$.\n$N+x = 97 \\to (1)$\n$5x+N = 265$\nNow we solve the system:\n\\begin{cases}\nN+x = 97 \\\\\n5x+N = 265\n\\end{cases} We start with the first equation:\nN = 97 \u2013 x\nNow substitute $N$ into the second equation:\n\\begin{align*}5x+97-x = 265\\end{align*} Then\n4x=168\nx=168/4\nx=42\nAnd we know $N$:\nN = 97-42\nN = 55\nSo, Mr. Wrench charges $\\$55$for coming out to the house.\nNow, we find his charge for an eight-hour repair job. N + 8x = ? \\$\n55 + 8(42) = \\$\n55 + 336 = \\$\n391\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\$391. I hope it is correct. ### References:\n(1) Solving the System of Equations. (2019).

        " An 8-hour repair job will cost Mr. Wrench NP, where N is his base charge to come out to the house.  NP = N + 8x, for an 8-hour repair job, so he will charge N + 8x dollars.
