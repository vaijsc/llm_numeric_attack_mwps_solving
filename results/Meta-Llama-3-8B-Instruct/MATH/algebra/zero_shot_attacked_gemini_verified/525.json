If we let $y=f(x)$, then this composition can be looked at as $f(f(10))=f(y)$, or we can write $y=f(x)$, then $x=f(y)$. We can see from this step-by-step process that $f(2)=1$, $f(10)=2$, and $f(3)=10$, and from these equations we can see that $f(3)=10$ or $f(f(10))=10$, so$\\boxed{10}$. 281244482980_1b7a5b14e3bd\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 10.

From here, we need to figure out what is $f(f(10))$. Let $b=f(10)$. Since $h(10)=3$, we have that $3$ is the image of $10$, which means that $f(f(10))=3$.

Therefore,we could view the inverse as a reflection of the function over the line y = x.412. If h(x) = f^(-1)(x) then f^{-1}(x) = f(3) and if there are any other real roots of the of f(x), then we can obtain their other function values using the derivative of the function, which can now be found by substituting these new function values as these roots until we have determined one more. The inverse of the function is defined as the function whose range is the same as the domain of the original function, and whose domain is the same as the range of the original function.\nI hope this will help you in your first try in this class.

We have discussed that $P$ is directly proportional to $W$. We can represent this information in the form of the equation: $PF = KW$, where $F$ is the initial price of the item, $K$ is a constant. To solve this equation, we can divide both sides by $F$ to obtain $P = KW/F$. Notice that in this equation, $F$ is eliminated, so $P$ can now be expressed only in terms of $K$ and $W$. We then solve this equation for $W$ by dividing both sides by $K$ to obtain $W = P/K$. Now we have expressed $W$ in terms of $P$ and $K$, but we were originally asked to express $W$ in terms of the initial width $W_0$, so we substitute $w/W_0 = w/W_0$ into the expression.\nSolution by function: The problem asks to express $W$ as a function of $W_",
