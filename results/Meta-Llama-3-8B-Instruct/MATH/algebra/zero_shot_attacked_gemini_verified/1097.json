        " \nSuppose the length of the rectangular plot is $$x$$ feet. Then the width is $$x + 5$$ feet. To find the area of the plot, we multiply the length and the width: $$A = x(x + 5).$$    \nWe want the area to be at least 1200 ft$$^{2}$$, which is equivalent to saying that $$A \\geq 1200$$.    \nWe can rewrite this inequality as $$x^2 + 5x \\geq 1200$$, which is equivalent to $$x^2 + 5x - 1200 \\geq 0$$. We want to solve this inequality for $$x$$. We can also do this by factoring: $$x^2 + 5x - 1200 \\geq 0$$ $$\\Leftrightarrow (x + 60)(x - 20) \\geq 0$$ $$\\Leftrightarrow x \\geq 20 \\quad \\mbox{or} \\quad x \\leq -60$$ Since $$x$$ is the length of the plot, it must be positive. Therefore, $$x \\geq 20$$ is the only relevant solution.    \nRecall that the width is $$x + 5$$ feet. Therefore, the minimum amount of fencing possible is used when the width is the minimum possible. So, we substitute $$x = 20$$ into the expression for the width: $$x + 5 = 20 + 5 = \\boxed{25}$$ ft.

        " Like the polynomial division problem last night, this problem is about finding two variable integers from two constraints. \nIn this question, we have two variables: width of the plot as x and length of the plot as y. \nThe area of the plot should be 1200 square feet or more, so let\u2019s write this as an equation: xy >= 1200.\nWe also know that the width of the plot is 5 ft longer than the length. So, the width x is y + 5.\nSubstitute this equation into the first equation. You get (y+5)y >= 1200. This is quardratic equation and let\u2019s factor it as (y+10)(y-12) >= 0. Then, the solution will be y >= 12 and y <= -10 (but y is a length, so y should be positive).\nSo, the y = 12 is the minimum value for the length y. And the width x = 17.\n### Answer: The width of the plot is 17 ft. \nThis question is quite simple. I compared it to a quadratic equation. And I think we need to be more careful with variable signs. The width and length should be positive, so that is why y >= 12. In future questions, we should always consider the possible signs of variables. \nNow, let\u2019s do a little addition exercise. We can draw a plot with a length of 12 and a width of 17, and find the total perimeter. Let\u2019s call the length of the plot L, and width W. The perimeter of a rectangle is the sum of its four sides: 2*L + 2*W. In this case, L = 12 and W = 17. So the perimeter is 2*12 + 2*17 = 40 ft. This is our solution to this problem. We solved for the two variables and then found the total perimeter using the variables. ",

        " \nLet\u2019s say the length of the rectangular plot is x ft. \nThe width of the plot is x + 5 ft.\nTo find the total area (in square feet) of the plot, you multiply the length (x) by the width (x + 5):\nArea = x \u00d7 (x + 5) = x^2 + 5x\nWe know that the area must be at least 1200 ft^2, so:\nx^2 + 5x \u2265 1200\nTo minimize the fencing, we want the perimeter (the total distance around the plot) to be as small as possible. Since the fencing doesn\u2019t create a corner, we don\u2019t need to worry about diagonal measurements. \nThe perimeter is the sum of the length and width times 2 (since there are two dimensions along each edge). This is:\nPerimeter = 2x + 2(x + 5) = 4x + 10 (ft)\nNow, let\u2019s simplify the inequality:\nx^2 + 5x \u2265 1200\nx^2 + 5x - 1200 \u2265 0\n(x + 60)(x - 20) \u2265 0\nThis tells us that either x + 60 \u2265 0 (in which case x \u2265 -60) or x - 20 \u2265 0 (in which case x \u2265 20).\nSince x can\u2019t be negative (it represents the length of a plot!), we ignore the negative solution for x. \nThe positive solution for x \u2265 20 tells us that the minimum length is 20 ft. \nTo find the corresponding width, we plug this value back into the expression for width:\nWidth = x + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25 ft\nSo, the width of the plot is 25 ft. \ud83c\udfde\ufe0f",
        " A square grid will help us. Here's a diagram of the problem:\n![Fencing Problem](https://daycscwrites.github.io/DayCSCWrites.github.io/DOCUMETATION/image002.png)\nHere, we draw the plot of land. Since length l is 5 ft less than the width w , we have\nw = l + 5 ft\nThe total fencing F is the sum of the length of all the portions of the fence and the length of four more pieces of fence.\nF = 2 l + w = 2 l + l + 5 ft\nNow, let\u2019s simplify the equation F:\nF = 3 l + 5 ft\nWe are told that the area (the rectangle with the points p and q) is 1200 sq. ft.\nArea = l \u00d7 w = l \u00d7 (l + 5 ft)\nNaming two terms: l \u00d7 l = l\u00b2 and l \u00d7 5 ft = 5 l, we get:\nl\u00b2 + 5 l = 1200"
