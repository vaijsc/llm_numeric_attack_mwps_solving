I just want to double-check your steps, though. Step1: You got that correct. The equation of the line in the point-slope form is $y-5 = \\frac12(x-2)$. Step2: Your conversion to the slope-intercept form looks fine, too. The equation $y=\\frac12x+4$ is correct. Step3: You correctly found the $y$-coordinate of the $y$-intercept by substituting 0 for $x$. My only suggestion is to be a bit more explicit in your wording. For example, in Step3, you could write \"When $x=0$, we have $y=\\frac12(0)+4$.\" This would make your response even clearer. Otherwise, your work looks great! ### Student: Thank you for the feedback! I will try to be more explicit in my wording. I appreciate your suggestions.

        " The $y$-intercept of a line is the point where the line crosses the $y$-axis. When we talked about the line, for example, we said that it has an equation that is in the form of $y - mx + c$, where $m$ is the slope of the line, and $c$ is the $y$-intercept of the line. So if we have the equation $y - m(2) + 5$, we know that $y - 2m + 5$. But we can\u2019t do this.\nWe have to find the equation for the line first.
