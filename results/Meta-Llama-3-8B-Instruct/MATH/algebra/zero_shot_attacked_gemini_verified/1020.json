For x greater than 8, x-8 is positive.\n* For x+5, when x is less than -5, x+5 is negative. For x greater than -5, x+5 is positive.\nNow, let's combine these conditions:\n* When x is between -5 and 8 (exclusive), x-8 is positive, and x+5 is negative, so their product is negative. This range is (-5, 8).\n* The smallest integer that satisfies the inequality is 6, which lies within the range (-5, 8).\nTherefore, the smallest integer that satisfies the inequality (x-8)(x+5) < 0 is 6.",

Along the x-axis, this condition means the parabola opens upwards.\nHence, our goal is to find the smallest integer that satisfies the inequality.\nBy looking at the parabola, we notice that the vertex is at (-3, -25). Let\u2019s draw the parabola on the coordinate plane.\nSince the parabola opens upwards, we only need to satisfy the condition when x > -3.\nFor x > -3, (x \u2013 8)(x + 5) is negative between the x-intercepts (-8 and -5).\nLet\u2019s try x = -2.\n(-2 \u2013 8)(-2 + 5) = 6\nSince 6 is positive, this does not satisfy the inequality.\nLet\u2019s try x = -1.\n(-1 \u2013 8)(-1 + 5) = 4\nAgain, 4 is positive and does not satisfy the inequality.\nLet\u2019s try x = 0.\n(0 \u2013 8)(0 + 5) = -40\nThis satisfies the inequality!\nTherefore, the smallest integer that satisfies the inequality (x \u2013 8)(x+5) < 0 is x = 0. \n### video solution\nhttps://www.mathantutor.com/inequality-regions-of-signs-and-graphs/video-solution-to-finding-the-smallest-integer-that-satisfies-the-inequality-x-8-x-5-less-than-0/\nNo transcript available for this video.

        " \nThe first step is to solve the inequality (x-8)(x+5) < 0. To do this, we need to identify the values of x that make the product less than 0.\n### Continue the response: \nRecall that the product of two numbers is negative when one is positive and the other is negative. So, we need to find the values of x that make exactly one of the factors (x - 8) and (x + 5) positive and the other negative.\nLet's start by analyzing the factors:\n- (x - 8) < 0 | only when x < 8\n- (x + 5) > 0 | always, since x is a real number\nSince we want exactly one factor to be negative, we need x to be between 8 and -5. To make (x - 8) positive, we require x > 8. Since we know x < 8, it is impossible for x to satisfy this condition.\nHowever, we can make (x + 5) negative by having x < -5. This is possible since -5 is between -5 and 8.\nWe have successfully identified the values of x that make the product (x - 8)(x + 5) < 0. The values of x that satisfy the inequality are x \u2208 (-5, 8).",

But, it is a wall; the graph does not touch the line here.\nCase 2: x-8=0\nIn this case, x=8. Again, it is a wall; the graph does not touch the line here.\nSo, the graph lies between the points x=-5 and x=8. We can do it by the inertia method:\nIf the left side of the equation is positive, it is above the x-axis; if it is negative, it is below the x-axis. The inequality is that the equation has to be positive and cross to the negative. So, the boundary is when it crosses the x-axis.\nThe crossing in a graph is when it is positive on one side and negative on the other side.",
        " \nWe have an inequality with the form: f(x) = (x - 8)(x + 5) < 0.\nSince the given inequality involves multiplication of two linear terms, the function will have zeros at x = -5 and x = 8.

Finding the region below the x-axis, we get the inequality:\n-5 < x < 8\nSo, the smallest integer that satisfies the inequality is x = 6.\nAnswer: 6\n### Alternative Solution:\nWe have the inequality (x-8)(x+5) < 0. We can analyze this inequality step by step:\n\u2022 When x < -5, both terms are negative, resulting in a positive product.\n\u2022 When x = -5, one factor becomes zero, and the product is zero.\n\u2022 When -5 < x < 8, one factor is positive and the other is negative, resulting in a negative product.\n\u2022 When x = 8, one factor becomes zero, and the product is zero.\n\u2022 When x > 8, both terms are positive, resulting in a positive product.\nTherefore, the inequality is satisfied when -5 < x < 8.
