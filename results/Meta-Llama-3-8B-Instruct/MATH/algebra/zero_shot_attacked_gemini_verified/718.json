        " 5 + 1/2 = 11/2\nWrite down the given equation. And we have given a mathematical equation. Five plus the reciprocal of a number equals 11 divided by that number.\nWe don't know what this number is, but let's call it 'n'. And then, we can rewrite that equation into a mathematical equation. So that becomes '5 + 1/n = 11/n'.\nWe should make sure that we are in the same denominator if we want to have the same denominator. And basically, all denominators are multiples of 'n'.\nSo, then we can multiply both sides of this equation by 'n', and we have '5n + 1 = 11'. Then, we subtract '1' from both sides. And then we have '5n = 10'.\nAnd then, we divide by '5' and we get 'n = 2'. So, our number is 'n' = 2.\nNow, let's substitute 'n = 2' into the original equation.
