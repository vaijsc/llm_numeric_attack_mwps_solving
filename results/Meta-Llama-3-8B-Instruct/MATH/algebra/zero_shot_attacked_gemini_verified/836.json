Keep up the good job!\nHowever, you should be careful because your answer has a minus sign on its left side and several negative numbers in the calculation, and also some students might confuse the number $8x^2 -8x +15$ with the number $8(x-1/2)^2+15/2$, which is not true in this case.\nBesides, you do not need to simplify $8x^2 - 8x + 15$ first. You can also solve the problem by computing the discriminant directly, i.e., the quantity $b^2-4ac$, where $a=8, b=-8$ and $c=15$.

        " The discriminant is b^2 - 4ac. Substitute a = 8, b = -8, and c = 15. This is 64 - 4 * 8 * 15. This is 64 - 96 = -32.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -32. I hope it is correct.  I'll welcome your feedback.  I made no calculations to ensure it was correct before writing it down.  That is why I'm a bit unsure.  Thank you for letting me know.  Please let me know if I can help you with anything else.  Here is how to verify your answer.  If you call your polynomial, f(x), then we can calculate f'(-2) = 8 * -2 - 8 - 30 = -56. Then, f(-2) = 8 * (-2)^2 - 8 * (-2) + 15 = 8 * 4 + 16 + 15 = 65. Then, f(0) = 8 * 0 - 8 * 0 + 15 = 15.  Notice f'(-2) * f(0) = -56 * 15 = -840.  Then f(-2) * f(0) = 65 * 15 = 975.  Then the Quadratic Formula is (b^2 - 4ac)^0.5, so $\\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} = \\sqrt{(8)^2-4(8)(15)} = \\sqrt{64-480} = \\sqrt{-416} = 8i\\sqrt{26}$.
