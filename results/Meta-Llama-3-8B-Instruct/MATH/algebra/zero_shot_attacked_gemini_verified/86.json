This equation shows that we need to find the power $x$ such that 2 raised to the power $x$ gives us 3.\nWe don\u2019t have a simple way to calculate $x$ directly. However, we can use approximation methods.\nNote that $2^2=4<3$ and $2^3=8>3$.\nSo, we can say that $2^2<3<2^3$. This implies $2<3^{1/2}<4$, or $log_2< log_32< log_4$.\nWe are looking for $x$ such that $2^x=3$, but we know that $2<3^{1/2}$ and $2^2<3$, we can conclude that $$x \\approx 1.585$$.
