        " \nTo find the distance between two points, we need to find the distance between the x-coordinates and the distance between the y-coordinates. \nFirst, let's calculate the distance between Robert and Lucy: \nThe x-coordinates are 4 and 6, so we subtract them: 6 - 4 = 2\nThe y-coordinates are 3 and 6, so we subtract them: 6 - 3 = 3\nNow we need to take the square root of the sum of these two distances: \n\u221a(2^2 + 3^2) = \u221a(4 + 9) = \u221a13\nSo, the distance between Robert and Lucy is \u221a13 units. \nNow, let's do the same for Robert and Liz. \nThe x-coordinates are 4 and 1, so we subtract them: 4 - 1 = 3\nThe y-coordinates are 3 and 7, so we subtract them: 7 - 3 = 4\nNow we need to take the square root of the sum of these two distances: \n\u221a(3^2 + 4^2) = \u221a(9 + 16) = \u221a25\nSo, the distance between Robert and Liz is \u221a25 units. \nNow, we need to compare the two distances to find the farther person from Robert. \n\u221a13 < \u221a25, so Liz is the farther person from Robert. \nThe distance between Robert and Liz is \u221a25 units. \n#### Detailed Answer: \nThe definition of distance in a Cartesian coordinate plane is: \ndistance = \u221a((x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2) \nIn this problem, we have three people: Robert, Lucy, and Liz. Robert is standing at point (4,3), Lucy at point (6,6), and Liz at point (1,7). \nWe need to find the distance between Robert and the farther person. We will calculate the distance between Robert and Lucy, and Robert and Liz, and then compare them to find the farther person.\n1. Distance between Robert and Lucy: \nFirst, we find the difference between the x-coordinates: 6 - 4 = 2 \nNext, we find the difference between the y-coordinates: 6 - 3 = 3 \nNow, we take the square root of the sum of these two differences: \n\u221a(2^2 + 3^2",
        "\\\nThis problem requires us to first calculate the distance between Robert and the two other people. \nThe formula to calculate distance is:\ndistance = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)\nRobert is at point (4,3) and Lucy is at point (6,6) so:\ndistance = sqrt((6 - 4)^2 + (6 - 3)^2) = sqrt(2^2 + 3^2) = sqrt(13)\nNext, move on to calculate the distance between Robert and Liz:\ndistance = sqrt((1 - 4)^2 + (7 - 3)^2) = sqrt(3^2 + 4^2) = sqrt(25) = 5\nNow we have the distances of 5 [Liz] and  \u221a13 [Lucy] from Robert. \nThe farther person from Robert is Lucy, as  \u221a13 is greater than 5. \nTherefore, the farther person from Robert is  \u221a13 units away from Robert.

        " We need to find the distance from Robert to the farther person.\nWe need to find the distance from Robert to each person: Robert - Lucy, Robert - Liz, and calculate the maximum distance.

D. 5 units away from Robert.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 5. I hope it is correct. charitymonk\n### let\u2019s repeat the process\nIt is very simple: you can just use the distance formula. What is the final answer?\nLet\u2019s apply the distance formula for the distance between Robert and Lucy:\n\u221a((6-4)\u00b2 +(6-3)\u00b2) = \u221a(2\u00b2 + 3\u00b2) = \u221a(4 + 9) = \u221a13\nLIst moving the next step with it.\nDistance from Robert to Liz: \u221a((1-4)\u00b2 +(7-3)\u00b2) = \u221a((-3)\u00b2 + 4\u00b2) = \u221a(9 + 16) = \u221a25 units\nWe see that Lucy is much farther than Son. It is 13 units away. It is 13 moves. If you take it back up, you could have easier ways of cutting. Thank you for being patient.\nLet\u2019s do this again. How much less is the distance between Liz and Robert than between Lucy and Robert?\nHow much less is \u221a25 than \u221a13? So the distance between Liz and Robert is 4 units less than between Lucy and Robert. charitymonk\nSo the farther person from Robert is Lucy. So the farther person is 5 units away from Robert. D. 5 units away from Robert.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 5. I hope it",

In this case, we want the distance between Robert\u2019s point (4, 3) and Lucy\u2019s point (6, 6). First, we will plug in these values into the distance formula: Distance = \u221a((6-4)^2 + (6-3)^2) = \u221a((2)^2 + (3)^2) = \u221a(4 + 9) = \u221a13 = 3.6 We will now plug in Robert\u2019s point (4, 3) and Liz\u2019s point (1, 7) into the distance formula: Distance = \u221a((1-4)^2 + (7-3)^2) = \u221a((-3)^2 + (4)^2) = \u221a(9 + 16) = \u221a25 = 5 We now see that since 5 is greater than 3.6, Liz is the farther person from Robert.

First, we want to subtract Robert\u2019s x-coordinate from Lucy\u2019s x-coordinate, and then subtract Robert\u2019s y-coordinate from Lucy\u2019s y-coordinate. That is, subtract 6 from 4 and subtract 6 from 3.\n$$distance = \\sqrt{(6 - 4)^2 + (6 - 3)^2} = \\sqrt{2^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{13}$$\nThe farther person is now Lucy. So, we have to find the distance of Robert and Liz.\n#### distance of Robert & Liz:\nNow, we want to subtract Liz\u2019s x-coordinate from Robert\u2019s x-coordinate, and then subtract Liz\u2019s y-coordinate from Robert\u2019s y-coordinate.\n$$distance = \\sqrt{(1 - 4)^2 + (7 - 3)^2} = \\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \\sqrt{25} = 5$$\n#### When comparing the distance between Robert and Lucy, and the distance between Robert and Liz, it is clear that Lucy is the farther person from Robert.\nWe know the distance from Robert to Lucy as $\\boxed{\\sqrt{13}}$.\nAsked in: mtgexamrevolution (MTG Exam Revolution )\nCategory: mtgexamrevolution (MTG Exam Revolution ) / math",
        " 10 units\nUsing the distance formula we have: \nd=\\sqrt{(6-4)^2+(6-3)^2} \\approx 5.4\nSo, Lucy is 5.4 units away from Robert.\nAnd for Liz:\nd=\\sqrt{(1-4)^2+(7-3)^2} \\approx 8.6\nSo, Liz is 8.6 units away from Robert.\nWe want to find out how many units away is the farther person from Robert, so we compare the distances:\n8.6 > 5.4\nSo, Liz is farther from Robert than Lucy.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 8.6. I hope it is correct. \n\nLet's calculate the distance between Robert and each of the other two people.\nRobert is at $(4, 3)$.\nLucy is at $(6, 6)$, so the distance between them is:\n$$d_{RL} = \\sqrt{(6 - 4)^2 + (6 - 3)^2} = \\sqrt{(2)^2 + (3)^2} = \\sqrt{13} \\approx 3.61$$\nRobert is at $(4, 3)$.\nLiz is at $(1, 7)$, so the distance between them is:\n$$d_{RL} = \\sqrt{(1 - 4)^2 + (7 - 3)^2} = \\sqrt{(-3)^2 + (4)^2} = \\sqrt{25} = 5$$\nSince $5 > 3.61$, Liz is farther from Robert. The final answer is $5$ units.  ## First method\nLet's find the distance between Robert and each of the other two people:\nRoberts location = (4,3)\nLucys location = (6,6)\nDistance = sqrt((6-4)^2 + (6-3)^2) = sqrt(4+9) = sqrt13\nRoberts location = (4,3)\nLizs location = (1,7)\nDistance = sqrt((1-4)^2+(7-3)^2) = sqrt(9+16) = 5\nComparing distances, we see that Liz is farther away from Robert.kre",
        " \nFirst, find the distance between Robert and Lucy. The distance formula is d = sqrt((x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2).\nLet\u2019s plug in the values for Robert at (4,3) and Lucy at (6,6):\nd = sqrt((6 - 4)^2 + (6 - 3)^2)\nd = sqrt(2^2 + 3^2)\nd = sqrt(13)\nd \u2248 3.61\nSo the distance between Robert and Lucy is approximately 3.61 units.\nNow find the distance between Robert and Liz. Using the same distance formula:\nd = sqrt((1 - 4)^2 + (7 - 3)^2)\nd = sqrt(-3^2 + 4^2)\nd = sqrt(9 + 16)\nd = sqrt(25)\nd = 5\nSo the distance between Robert and Liz is exactly 5 units.\nRobert is closer to Lucy than Liz, so the farther person from Robert is Liz, at a distance of approximately 5 units. Robert is also farther away from 2 other people (Lucy is one of them), so keep in mind that, in a hypothetical scenario with an infinite number of people, the person farther away from Robert could be different. However, in this specific scenario, 5 units separates Robert from Liz.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 5. I hope it is correct.### ",
