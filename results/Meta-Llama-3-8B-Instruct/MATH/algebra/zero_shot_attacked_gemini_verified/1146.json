        " The idea is that for each year, Jo gives Aiden one more toy car than in the previous year. To understand why, think about this: If Aiden was 1 year old, then Jo would give him 1 toy car. If Aiden was 2 years old, then Jo would give him 2 toy cars. If Aiden was 3 years old, then Jo would give him 3 toy cars. See a pattern? Anyway, let\u2019s figure out how many toy cars Aiden has received.\nAt some point, Aiden will be one year old. That\u2019s year 1. At that point, he receives 1 toy car.\nThe next year, Aiden will be 2 years old. He receives 2 toy cars. In total, he has 1 + 2 = 3 toy cars.\nThe next year, Aiden will be 3 years old. He receives 3 toy cars. In total, he has 3 + 3 = 6 toy cars.\nThis continues for 41 years.\nNow, let\u2019s add up all those toy cars. At 1 year old, Aiden receives 1 toy car. At 2 years old, he receives 2 toy cars. And so on up until 41 years old. For this last year, he receives 42 toy cars. In total, he has 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + ... + 41 + 42 toy cars.\n### Formula: Using the formula for an arithmetic sequence:\n$$a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d$$\nwhere $d$ is the difference between each term in the sequence, we can calculate the sum of the terms as:\n$$S_n = \\frac{n(a_1 + a_n)}{2}$$\nHere, we have:\n- $a_1 = 1$, since at age 1, Aiden receives 1 toy car.\n- $n = 42$ since Aiden is 42 years old.\n- $a_n = 42$ since he receives 42 toy cars at the age of 42.\nUsing the formula, we have:\n$$S_{42} = \\frac{42(1 + 42)}{2} = 861$$\nThis means that Aiden has received a total of 861 toy cars from Jo. That\u2019s A LOT of toy cars!",

When he got the cars for his 42nd birthday, he will have 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + . . . + 41 + 42 cars. Here\u2019s the trick: pretend you want the sum of 1 + 2 + 3 + . . . + n. We are talking about 1 + 2 + 3 + . . . + 41. The trick is to add 1 + (n + 1), which gives you 2 + 2 + (n + 1), which has the same result when you add up the two expressions (then cancel the 1 and the (n + 1) on each side). But then, each side has n + 1. So add that, too, and you get:\n(1 + (n + 1)) + (1 + (n + 1)) + . . .\nSince there are n terms, you get n + n + 1, which is 2n + 1.

For those who can't recall their special number, don't panic! There's always that fantastic website with the formulae and stuff!
