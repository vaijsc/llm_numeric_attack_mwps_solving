I hope it is correct.oves.oves.oves.oves.oves.ove\n### Explanation:\nIn order to solve the equation, we will eliminate the fractions on the LHS by multiplying both sides by the common denominator, which is $x+1$. We then expand and rearrange the equation, obtaining a quadratic equation that can be factored to give the solution, which is $x=13$.3663322033 Vollstatistik-Eintr\u00e4ge: 1 Vollstatistik-Suche: 0 Fail-Suchdauer: 0 s Vollstatistik-betretene\u00a0Pages: 0 Vollstatistik-Web-Transfers: 0 Vollstatistik- average response time: 0.000 ms Vollstatistik-hit number: 1 Vollstatistik-betretene\u00a0hits: 17300821 Vollstatistik-is\u00a0this\u00a0 Dort anh\u00e4ngen kostenlose Antwort? \nSkip to content\n Vollstatistik\nWeakness Indonesien\nVollstatistik\nListen:\nCultura Tek von Stern | Entscheidungen | Ihre Folgen | Menschen\nSkip to content@{ [.ConnectionString] } C:\\inetpubmixed-content orney-Logger\u00a0script\u00a0Routing-Google-Zu-Persistent-L\u9ae5z\u00a0",
