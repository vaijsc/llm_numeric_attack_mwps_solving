        "  To begin with, rewrite the right hand side as a power of 2.  Since\n$256=2^8$, it follows that $256^{\\frac{1}{2}} = (2^8)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2^{4}.$\nNow the equation becomes $5^{2x}=2^{4}$.\nThe next step is to do a change of base, or more precisely, to convert the base 5 to base 2.  We can do this because $5^2=25$ has the same number of bits as $2^4=16$.  (You can easily see this by using two's complement representation).  So, note that $25$ is precisely the sum of four $2$'s:\n$$25 = 2+2+2+2=2^2+2^2+2^2+2^2.$$Therefore, $5^{2x}$ is also equal to $(2^2+2^2+2^2+2^2)^x$,\nwhich is equal to $2^{2x}+2^{2x}+2^{2x}+2^{2x}=4x2^{2x}$.\nNow we can set this equal to $2^{4}$, and solve for $x$.  It follows that\n\\begin{align*}\n4x2^{2x}&=2^4\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x&=\\frac{2^4}{4\\cdot 2^{2x}}=\\frac{2^{4-2x}}{4}\n\\end{align*}\nBecause $4=2^2$, we can simplify:\n$$x=\\frac{2^{4-2x}}{2^2}=\\frac{2^{4-2x}}{4}=2^{4-2x-1}$$\nThis means that $4-2x-1=0$, which gives $4-2x=1$.
