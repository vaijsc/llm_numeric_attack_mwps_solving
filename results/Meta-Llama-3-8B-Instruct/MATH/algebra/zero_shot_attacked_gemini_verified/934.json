        " A diameter of a circle is the longest possible distance across a circle. The center of the circle splits the diameter into two radii. Let the center be (x,y). We know that two points on the circle, 7,-8 and -3,-4, satisfy the distance formula: So, Now, (x-7)^2 + (y+8)^2 = (x+3)^2 + (y+4)^2 This becomes Now, Differentiating both sides with respect to x and y, we get So, Checking, we get So, You can\u2019t have solutions here, but it is possible that there was a mistake somewhere.\nFor me this seems like a difficult question because you have to think quickly before the buzzer goes. It is a higher-level maths problem that considers percentages, and it requires instant calculations and spatial thinking.  Thus, we have to speedily determine the average of the two points and the middle of line connecting them. That\u2019s our solution (x, y).  The middle is the point the most distant point/discrete points.  The easiest way is to take note of the mean of the average of the X values ($x_1+ x_2)/2$) and the mean of Y values (($y_1+ y_2)/2).  The x value, it becomes3/2(7+ (-3) = 7-3/2= 2 To get the value (X) ($2).
