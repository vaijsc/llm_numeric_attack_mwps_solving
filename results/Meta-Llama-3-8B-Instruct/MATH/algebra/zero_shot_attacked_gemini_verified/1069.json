        " First, we need to solve for $x$. One way to do this is to divide both sides of the equation by $-96$ to obtain the equivalent equation\n$$\\frac{192x^2}{96} = 1 \\Rightarrow x^2 = 1$$\nNext, we take the square root of both sides.\nThis means we can write $x = \\pm 1$.

        " The given equation is $192x^2 - 96 = 0$.\nTo make this equation look a bit simpler, we can factor the LHS of the equation. The LHS can be factored as\n$$192x^2-96=12(16x^2-8)=12\\cdot 2(8x^2-4).$$From here we can write it as\n$$192x^2 - 96=12\\cdot2(2x)^2-12\\cdot 2(2)=12(2x)^2-24,$$and now we can write it as\n$$192x^2 - 96=12(2x)^2-24.$$Factoring the LHS we get\n$$192x^2 - 96=12(2x-2)(2x+2).$$Equating the two expressions we have\n$$12(2x-2)(2x+2)=0.$$Now we can solve for $x$. Factoring we get\n$$(2x-2)(2x+2)=0.$$Dividing by 2 both the expressions we have\n$$x-1=0,$$ $x+1=0.$$Solving these two equations we have $x=1, x=-1$. Therefore we have $x=1, x=-1.$ Back to our question.

I you are looking for real values, you can only say $\\frac{1}{x^4}$ is undefined. Checking for real values x\u2208R, 192x^2 - 96 = 192x^2 - 0 is if and only if 8x - 3 = 0. If we let $y=8x-3$ then $x=\\frac{y+3}{8}$. To be valid, this must be a non-negative value, this means that the equation $8x-3=0$ has real values for all possible x\u2208R which means that all the values can be for the non-negative and non real numbers which means all real numbers but we can use these numbers to get you your answer the answer to these numbers to $y=\\frac{192 - 96}{192} = \\frac{96}{192} = \\frac{3}{4}$. Value of x = $\\frac{\\frac{3}{4}+3}{8}$ = $\\frac{\\frac{3}{4}+6}{8}$ = $\\frac{3}{4*8}$ = $\\frac{1}{8}$, $\\frac{1}{x^4}$ = $\\frac{1}{(\\frac{1}{8})^4}$ = 4.

        " \nIf $192x^2 - 96 = 0$, then $192x^2 = 96$. Therefore, $x^2 = \\frac{1}{2}$. So, we can write $x=\\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}$.\nWe are asked for $\\dfrac{1}{x^4}$. We want to calculate $\\dfrac{1}{\\left(\\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}\\right)^4}$.\nWe can simplify it by calculating $\\left(\\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}\\right)^4$ first. Notice that $\\left(\\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}\\right)^4$ is equivalent to $(\\pm)^4 (\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}})^4$.\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\left(\\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}\\right)^4\\\\\n&=(\\pm)^4 (\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}})^4\\\\\n&=(\\pm)^4 \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}\\right)^2\\\\\n&=(\\pm)^4 \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}}\\\\\n&=(\\pm)^4 \\frac{\\sqrt{1}}{\\sqrt{4}}\\\\\n&=(\\pm)^4 \\frac{1}{2}\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{2}\\text{ (because $\\left(\\pm\\right)^4$ has no effect)}.\n\\end{align*}\n$$\nSo, we know that $\\left(\\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}\\right)^4 = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nTherefore, we can write $\\frac{1}{x^4}$ as $\\frac{1}{\\left(\\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}\\right)^4} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2$.\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{2}$.albums=[{\u201c@type\u201d: \u201c",
        " We always recommend starting with the left-hand side of the equation and factoring; however, we cannot factor $192x^2 - 96$ so let\u2019s proceed without it.\nFactoring 192, we have:$$192x^2 - 96 = 16(12x^2 - 6) = 0.$$ Since $16$ is not $0$, we must have $$12x^2 - 6 = 0,$$ which implies $12x^2 = 6$.  Factoring out $6$, we can write $6x^2 = 6$ and then solve for $x$:$$6x^2 = 6 \\Rightarrow x^2 = 1 \\Rightarrow x = \\pm 1.$$Therefore, the possible solutions are $x = 1$ or $x = -1$.  If we let $x = 1$, we can see that $\\frac{1}{x^4} = \\frac{1}{1^4} = 1$.  And if we let $x = -1$, we can still see that $\\frac{1}{x^4} = \\frac{1}{1^4} = 1$.  Therefore, $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{x^4} = 1}$ for both solutions.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 1. I hope it is correct. (^-o)",

People who have trouble with it are often trying to simplify $x^2$ directly, which would result in $\\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$. This is incorrect. The way to solve this problem is to recognize that $192x^2 = 96$ and use this to find $x^4$. It is a good idea to start by calculating the value of $x^2$, for which you can use the division algorithm. The division algorithm is there to divide 192 by $x^2$ to see what the quotient is.
