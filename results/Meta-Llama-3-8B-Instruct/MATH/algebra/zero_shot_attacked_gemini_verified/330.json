And we want a little shortcut. In this case, I am going to simplify $1202^2-502^2$ first. To simplify $1202^2-502^2$ we need to find $1202+502$ and $1202-502$ and multiply them, then simplify only one step later $298^2-202^2$.\nSo we get\n$$1202^2-",
        " First, we use the difference of squares formula $a^2-b^2 = (a+b)(a-b)$ to rewrite the first term as\n$1202^2-502^2 = (1202+502)(1202-502).$\n### ",

        " There are several possible ways to solve this problem using algebraic manipulation.\nOne way to solve it is by expanding the expression into $(1202+502)(1202-502)+(1202-502)(298+202)$ and notice that the last two terms have a common factor, which helps us simplify.\nAnother way would be to notice that we have four squares, $x^2+3^2$ which we can rewrite as $(x+3)(x-3) + 9$. Thus we can get\n$$1202^2-502^2+298^2-202^2=(1202+3)(1202-3)+(1202-3)(298+202)=(1205)(1199)+(1495)(500).$$",

I hope it is correct. Thank you for using solution set #2. \n(Written on April 19, 2016) \nIf you are familiar with the common factor decomposition method of simplifying square differences, this would be much faster. That method takes advantage of the relationship $a^2-b^2 = (a+b)(a-b)$ for $a,b$ any real numbers to simplify $a^2-b^2+c^2-d^2$ to $(a+c-b-d)(a+c+b-d)$. The presented solution was intended for readers with less algebraic maturity. Those interested in learning about the common factor decomposition method should look up references on factorising quadratic expressions.\nEvery problem has its own value and this is not an exception. It is a unique problem that forces us to go step by step. \nFINALLY, another flashy computer-generated solution set exists here.\nA. $\\boxed{1232984}$  (There is an intermittent watch in to see if someone is reading and for my reference too.)\nTo explore this now, revisit the given information of $a^2-b^2+c^2-d^2$ with zero computer use to find that $(a+b)(a-b)+(c+d)(c-d)$. Then add $(a-c+d)^2$ and subtract $(a-d)^2$.\nAnd this can be, explored in other ways.\nFor a simple example: $a^2-b^2+c^2-d^2=(a+c-b-d)(a+c+b-d)$ So $a^2-b^2+c^2-d^2+c^2-d^2 = (a+c-b-d)(a+c+b-d)+ (c-d)(c-d)$ Thus, the above example (the second portion) in other approaches or methods have to pass some methods. $((a+c)^2-(b+d)^2)+((c-d)^2)\u9ad8\u7b49level.com level.\n",
