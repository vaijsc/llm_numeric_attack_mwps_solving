        " \nLet's go through the expression. $$2z^2+13z+21 = (z + a)(2z + b).$$We try to expand the expression and set it equal to the given one. $$2z^2+13z+21 = 2z^2+2bz+bz+a^2.$$From here, we see that $2a^2 = 21,$ so $a=\\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{21}{2}}$ or $a=\\mp\\sqrt{\\frac{21}{2}}.$ The question says that $a$ must be an integer. Since $\\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{21}{2}}$ is an irrational number, it\u2019s not the right answer. So, we can try other combinations.\nNow, we have $2bz + bz$, which means that $2b = 13$ and $b = \\frac{13}{2}$. This is also not an integer. We know that we have to take an integer, so we have to look for another combination of $2bz + bz$.\nFinally, we get $2bz + bz$ as $b$. Since we know that the question tells us that $b$ must be an integer, we conclude that $a$ and $b$ are both integers when we set them equal to an integer. That\u2019s when we take the odd part of our fraction: $b=13$, and $a=3$.\nThat means that $2a+b = 6+13 = \\boxed{19}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 19. I hope it is correct. ",

Comparing coefficients on both sides, we can make the following conclusions: $$2a+b=13$$ and $$ab=21$$\nSince $b$ is an integer, so are both $a$ and $21/b$, so $b$ is a factor of $21$. So, $b$ must be either $1$, $3$, $7$, or $21$. As we\u2019ll see below, these give us different possibilities for $a$. If $b=1$, then $ab=21$ implies that $a=21$. Therefore, we have $a=21$ and $b=1$, so $2a+b=43$. If $b=3$, then $ab=21$ implies that $a=7$. Therefore, we have $a=7$ and $b=3$, so $2a+b=17$. If $b=7$, then $ab=21$ implies that $a=3$. Therefore, we have $a=3$ and $b=7$, so $2a+b=13$. Finally, if $b=21$, then $21a=21$, which implies that $a=1$.

        " Since two first degree terms combine to yield a cubic term of a product of (z+a) and (2z+b), they must match the constants, and thus $2a\\cdot b=21$.

For this, we need to divide everything by $x^2$, so we have:\n$$x^2+ax+b-\\frac{2z^2}{x^2}-\\frac{13z}{x^2}-\\frac{21}{x^2}=0$$\nThis can be simplified as\n$$x^2+ax+b-\\frac{3z}{x^2-7z}-\\frac{21}{x^2-7z}=0$$\nWe want $a$ and $b$ integers. Since we considered that $\\frac{1}{x^2-7z}$ times the integer term $\\frac{3z}{x^2-7z}$ is not in the form $2z+a$, we have that $x^2+ax+b-\\frac{3z}{x^2-7z}=0$, which means that $x^2+ax+b=\\frac{3z}{x^2-7z}$. We can simplify it as\n$$x^2+ax+b=\\frac{3z(x^2-7z)}{x^2-7z}=\\frac{3z}{1}=3z$$\nThe equation is now reduced to the following:\n$$x^2+ax+b=3z$$\nSolving for $x^2$:\n$$x^2+ax+b-3z=0$$\nSolving for $x$:\n$$x=\\frac{-a\\pm\\sqrt{a^2-4(1)(b-3z)}}{2(1)}$$\nNow we simplify it to get $x$:\n$$x=\\frac{-a\\pm\\sqrt{a^2-4(b-3z)}}{2}$$\nNow, we simplify it using $a$ and $b$ as integers\n$$x=\\frac{-a\\pm\\sqrt",
        " \n$a$ is the coefficient of $z$. That is, $a$ is the value when $z = 1$ in the original expression.  Therefore, $a = \\frac{13}{2}$ by checking the expression.  Simplifying further, $a = \\frac{13}{2} = \\frac{6 \\cdot 2 + 1}{2} = 6 + \\frac{1}{2}$.  Since $a$ is an integer here, we can round $a$ to the nearest integer $6$.\n$b$ is the coefficient of $z^2$. Therefore, $b = 2 \\cdot 2 = 4$, since $2$ is the coefficient of $z^2$ in the original expression.\nPlugging the values of $a$ and $b$ in, $2a + b = 2(6) + 4 = \\boxed{16}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 16. I hope it is correct.  I used the formula for the product of a binomial to solve the problem.  I found $a = \\frac{13}{2}$ and $b = 4$.  I plugged them in to find $2a + b = 2 \\cdot 6 + 4 = \\boxed{16}$.  Solving the system of equations, we have $a = \\frac{13}{2} = 6 + \\frac{1}{2}$.  Note that we are only finding $a$ and $b$, and we need $a$ be integer.  We are rounding to the nearest integer.  Finally, I got the answer $\\boxed{16}$.  I hope you enjoy my response.

        " First of all, it is worth noting that if a quadratic can be written in the form $(z+a)(z+b)$, then the quadratic will have the form $z^2+(a+b)z+ab$.  Therefore, we can match up coefficients of $z$:\n\\begin{align*}\na+b &= 13,\\\\\nab &= 21.\n\\end{align*}From the second equation, we can factor $21$ as products of integers (i.e., we can find $a$ and $b$): $21 = 1\\cdot 21 = 3\\cdot 7$.  In order for $a+b=13$, $a$ can only be $3$, so we have $a=3$.

I hope it is correct.  I have removed most of the guesswork by getting agreement between the $z^2$-coefficient and the $(z+a)(z+b)$-factorization.  The rest is straightforward. I did not use guesswork this time; these methods are known (although presenting them needs some life and explanation). Also, we cannot get an extra 7 in each number (3 ans 10).
