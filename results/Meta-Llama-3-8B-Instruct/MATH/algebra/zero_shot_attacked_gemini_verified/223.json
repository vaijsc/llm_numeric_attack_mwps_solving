Why it doesn\u2019t give you the exact integer? Simply, is because of 84.53 gets cut off and rounded to 83 at the 100th hundredths place. It then 83 * 4 = 332. The answer does not have an integer because $log_3 59983$ is not an integer. It is because of the Decimal places after the first integer. To know the integer for sure, we need to check the value in calculator more times until we get the same answer in two consecutive calculations to stop the calculation. Thus, we get 7.37, till it becomes 7.37. And then we can put this value ($n \\approx 7.37$) to get the answer for the problem. It is the way to solve such a problem.

        " Clearly, we have $$\\frac{9^n\\cdot3^{2n+1}}{81}=743,$$ or, which is equivalent, $9^n\\cdot3^{2n+1}=743\\cdot81=60,303.$ We will quickly look at both sides. But, I think, before doing that, we can cancel something out. We can cancel out the term $3^{2n+1}$ in both sides to get $$9^n=\\frac{60,303}{3^{2n+1}}.$$ Now, recall that $a^b = a*a*\u2026*a$ and $a^{b1}=a^{b2}$ if $b1=b2.$ To write 60,303 as $3^{2n+1}$, we should write 60,303 as $3^{4} * 3^{3} * 3^2 * 3^1 * 3^0 = 3^{10}.$ Now, we recall the properties of exponents again. $$9^n=\\frac{3^{10}}{3^{2n+1}}$$ could be rewritten as $$(3^2)^n=\\frac{3^{10}}{3^{2n+1}},$$ which could be simplified as $$3^{2n}=\\frac{3^10}{3^{2n+1}},$$ which can be further rewritten as $$3^{2n}=3^8=3^{10-2}.$$ Which can be simplified even more as $$2n =10-2=8.$$ Or, we could solve it for $n$, and we get $\\boxed{n=4}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 4.

        " Let\u2019s begin by writing the given information as an equation: \\begin{align*} \\frac{9^n\\cdot3^{2n+1}}{81}&=743\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad \\frac{9^n\\cdot 3^{2n+1}}{3^4}&=743\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad 9^n \\cdot 3^{2n+1} &= 743\\cdot 3^4\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad 3^{n+2} \\cdot 3^{2n+1} &= 743\\cdot 3^4. \\end{align*}Both sides have a common factor of $3^{n+2}$.  Canceling this, we obtain\n$$3^{2n+1}=743\\cdot 3^2=2207.$$Equating the exponents on the left-hand side to the exponents on the right-hand side, we find that $$2n+1=3\\Rightarrow \\boxed{n=1}.$$ Notice that $n$ is not allowed to be negative, since $3$\u2019s to a negative power would not be defined.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is n = 1.

        " \nBased on your instruction, let's find the value of $n$.\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\frac{9^n\\cdot3^{2n+1}}{81}=743 \\\\\n&\\Rightarrow\\quad \\frac{3^{2n}\\cdot 3^{2n+1}}{81}=743 \\\\\n&\\Rightarrow\\quad \\frac{3^{2n+2n+1}}{3^4}=743 \\\\\n&\\Rightarrow\\quad 3^{4n+1}=743\\cdot 3^4 \\\\\n&\\Rightarrow\\quad 4n+1=\\log_3 743^4 \\\\\n&\\Rightarrow\\quad 4n+1=12 \\\\\n&\\Rightarrow\\quad 4n=11 \\\\\n&\\Rightarrow\\quad n=\\boxed{11/4}\\\\\n\\end{align*}Note: We can also use the Taylor series $\\dfrac{e^{ax}-1}{ax}=1+\\frac{1}{2}(ax)^1+\\frac{1}{3}(ax)^2+\\cdots$ to solve it.  But the approach you used is more direct.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 11/4. I hope it is correct.",
        " \nFirst, recall that $743 = \\frac{743}{1}$.  Now, we simplify the left-hand side.  Since $81 = 3^4$, we also know that $81 = 3^4$.  Now, write\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{9^n\\cdot3^{2n+1}}{81} = \\frac{3^{2n}\\cdot3^{2n+1}}{3^4} = \\frac{3^{2n+2n+1}}{3^4}.\n\\end{align*}We know that $\\frac{a^t}{a^s} = a^{t-s}$, as long as $t$ and $s$ are non-negative.  This trick helps us simplify further\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{9^n\\cdot3^{2n+1}}{81} = \\frac{3^{2n+2n+1}}{3^4} = \\frac{3^{4n+1}}{3^4},\n\\end{align*}which eventually gives us $\\frac{3^{4n+1}}{3^4} = 3^{4n+1-4} = 3^{n+1} = 743.$\n### ",
        " 1. $\\frac{9^n\\cdot3^{2n+1}}{81} = 743$\nFirst we simplify the given equation as shown below\n$$\\frac{9^n\\cdot3^{2n+1}}{3^4}=743$$\nWe can simplify it further by canceling out the power of $3$ for which both $9^n \\cdot 3^{2n+1}$ and $81 = 3^4$ has in common.\n$$\\frac{3^{2n+1-n}}{3^4}=743$$\nThis simplifies to\n$$3^{n+1}=3^4\\cdot743$$\n### ",
        " The numerator simplifies to $243^n\\cdot3^{2n+1}=729$, so we must have $243^n=729$.\n### Problem:\n#### (a) $243^n=729$\n### "
