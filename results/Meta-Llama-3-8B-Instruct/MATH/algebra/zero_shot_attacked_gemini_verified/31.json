        " First, we want to write the equation into the form (x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2. In other words, we want to complete the square.\nTo complete the square, first we have to put the x and y terms together. x^2 + 8x = x^2 + 8x + 16 - 16 = (x + 4)^2 - 16. Then, we have (x + 4)^2 - 16 + y^2 - 12y = 0.\nWe should also put the y terms together in a similar way. y^2 - 12y = y^2 - 12y + 36 - 36 = (y - 6)^2 - 36.
