I hope it is correct. #### Efficient solution  The diagram above helps to identify that the new parabola, when reflected about the line $y = k$, has an equation of the form $$y = a(x-h)^2 + k.$$This is because the line $y = k$ serves as the axis of symmetry for the new parabola, as the dot product is equal to k there. By expanding the above expression, we get$$y = ax^2-2ahx +ah^2 + k.$$This way we can determine that $d = a$, $e = -2ah$ and $f = ah^2 + k$. Substituting these values into the equation $d + e + f = (a + b + c) + k^2,$ we can reduce it to $a + b + c + d + e + f = a + b + c + k^2 = 0$. Which finally",

        " The parabola with equation $y=ax^2+bx+c$ and vertex $(h,k)$ is reflected about the line $y=k$. This results in the parabola with equation $y=dx^2+ex+f$. In terms of $k$, what is the value of $a+b+c+d+e+f$?\nWe consider the reflection of the vertex with respect to $y=k$. The reflected vertex has the same $x$-coordinate as the original vertex, and the same value for $y$ which is $k$. Therefore, the reflection of the vertex is $(h,k)$. Since the vertex does not shift as a result of the reflection, $h$ remains unchanged. This implies that $H = h$. It is given that $h = \\frac{-b}{2a}$ and $k = c-\\frac{b^2}{4a}$. After the reflection, the equation becomes $y = ax^2 - bx + c$. The vertex after the reflection is $(h,k)$ and the equation of the parabola with the vertex shifted becomes: $y = a(x-h)^2+k = a(x-\\frac{b}{2a})^2 + c = ax^2 - bx + c$. Thus, we conclude that $a = d$, $e = -b$, and $f = c$. Therefore, the sum of the coefficients becomes $a + b + c + d + e + f = a-b+a+c-d+b+c = \\boxed{2a}$. \\subsection{APAnalysis}  The correct answer is: 2a In comparison, the model of the GRE scoring software together with this issue seem to have caused a simple solution.\nNow, the outcome is that there seems to be an incorrect answer for the response which was after it.\nThe writer of the book, Kapron, has to take into consideration the object here and the situation which is in fact O Lumpy Points: Parabolic Reflex.

        " A parabola with equation $y=ax^2+bx+c$ has its vertex at $\\left(-\\frac{b}{2a},c-\\frac{b^2}{4a}\\right).$ It will be reflected in the line $y=k$, so we need to flip the $y$ coordinate of the original equation. So if the new equation is $y=d(x-p)^2+q$, the new vertex is a reflection of the old one across $y=k$, so $\\left(h,k\\right)$ is a reflection of $\\left(-\\frac{b}{2a},c-\\frac{b^2}{4a}\\right)$ across $y=k$, and it lies on the line $y=k$. So $\\left(-\\frac{b}{2a},c+\\frac{b^2}{4a}-k\\right)$ is a reflection of $\\left(-\\frac{b}{2a},c-\\frac{b^2}{4a}\\right)$ across $y=k$, and this reflection equals $\\left(h,k\\right)$. Thus, $h=-\\frac{b}{2a}$ and $k-\\left(c+\\frac{b^2}{4a}-k\\right)=k$, so $\\frac{b^2}{4a}=c$. Also, the vertex of the translated parabola is a reflection of $\\left(-\\frac{b}{2a},c-\\frac{b^2}{4a}\\right)$ across $y=k$, so the new vertex is $\\left(h,k\\right)$. Therefore, the translated parabola is of the form $y=d(x-h)^2+k$, so\n$$d(x-h)^2+k=ax^2+bx+c$$ Solving for $d$, we get $d=\\frac{a}{d}=\\frac{a}{a}=1$, so $d=1$. Solving for $b-h$, we get $b-h=(-2\\sqrt{a}\\sqrt{d})/2$, so $b-h=-\\sqrt{a}$, and setting this equal to $b$, we get $\\sqrt{a}=0$, so $a=0$, but we are told that $a\\neq0$, because there is a vertical translation of $c$. Thus, $b-h=b$, so $b=0$ is impossible. Solving for $b-h=-2a$, we get $b=-h-2",
        " a+b+c+d+e+f=0.\n1. Reflecting the parabola about the line $y=k$ is equivalent to taking the graph and flipping it along the line $y=k$.\nThis is because when you flip the graph of a function across a line, the $x$- and $y$-coordinates of the point swap (i.e., for any point $P=(x_1,y_1)$, $P$ becomes $\\left(x_1,k-y_1\\right)$).\n2. Next, let $x=x_1$, which represents a point that stays in place during the reflection ($P\\rightarrow P$). As $y=k-y_1$, the new $y$-coordinate for this point is $k-(ax_1^2+bx_1+c)$.\n3. You will need the desired equation: $y=dx^2+ex+f$. (We want this because it\u2019s the parabola resulting from the reflection).\n4. Here we know the new point: $(x_1,k-(ax_1^2+bx_1+c))$.\n5. In the classic form $y=ax^2+bx+c$, $y=c$ is the line where $y$ is a constant and where $y$ starts reducing when moving above the vertex, and $x=h$.\nSo, here we will do the reverse. \u201ck\u201d is now \u201cc\u201d and because $P$ doesn\u2019t change coordinates, $\\left(x,k-\\left(ax^2+bx+c\\right)\\right)$ $\\Rightarrow \\left(x,k-(23)+(ax^2+bx)\\right) \\Rightarrow (x,k-(ax^2+bx)) \\Rightarrow (x,k-y)$. $y=k-y$ $\\Rightarrow 0+y=k+y\\Rightarrow\\boxed{2y=k}$\n### Parabola Reflection:\nBefore reflection: $y=ax^2+bx+c$ $\\Rightarrow \\boxed{y=k}+(\\text{lower portion of parabola})$\nAfter reflection: $y=a(x-h)^2+k$ $\\Rightarrow y=c\\boxed{\\text{or}}$ $d(x-h)^2+k$ (To keep it simple, we use $y=c$, but $c$ could be any constant.)\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $a+b+c+d+e+f=0$.

        " \nLet us first find the equation of the parabola that is translated $k$ units down.\nIf the vertex is $(h,k)$, then the equation of the parabola is $y=a(x-h)^2+k$, or equivalently, $y=ax^2-2ahx+a(h^2-k)$.  To get the equation of the translated parabola, we subtract $k$ from each term to get $y=ax^2-2ahx+a(h^2-ahk)$. Now, we reflect this parabola over the line $y=k$, which is equivalent to reflecting the vertex at $(h,k)$ to $(h,2k)$, then translating each term up by $2k$.  We thus have $y-d(x-h)^2 + k$ for $y=ax^2-2ahx+a(h^2-k)+k$.  To expand this out, we have \\begin{align*} y-d(x-h)^2+k &= a(x^2-2hx+h^2)+k\\\\&=ax^2-2ahx+a(h^2-k)+k\\\\&=ax^2+e',\\end{align*} where we let $e'=-2ah-a(h^2-k)+k=-2ah-ahk+k$, so that $a+b+c+d+e+f=a+(e')=a-2ah-a(h^2-k)+k=a-ah-hahk+hk=a(1-h)-hahc$. \nNote that the parabola opens down if the vertex is above the line, and the parabola opens up if the vertex is below the line.  As long as we reflect around a point above the line, then the effects are symmetric, and a new vertex will be below the line, so the equation will not change, as $a$ shifts, it doesn't change, which is equivalent to not changing it, but we get another set of equation.

        " To reflect the parabola $y=ax^2+bx+c$ about the line $y=k$, we have to invert the $x$ values and keep the $y$ values. Therefore, the coordinates of the new parabola are switched. In other words, $(x,y)\\rightarrow(x,k-y)$.\nIn terms of $a,b,c,d,e,f$, we get\n$$f=k-c,\\quad e=-b,\\quad d=a,\\quad g=f.$$Therefore, $a+b+c+d+e+f=a-b+c+k$, and the value of $a+b+c+d+e+f$ in terms of $k$ is $\\boxed{2k}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2k. I hope it is correct. 2022 Solution II:\nThe vertex of our original parabola is at $(h,k)$, and its equation is:\n$$y = ax^2 + bx + c.$$It\u2019s a parabola, so hopefully you don\u2019t get too confused in the next step.\nWe have to reflect that parabola about $y=k$, so we\u2019re just going to think about really simple geometry.  Describe the parabola using the straught line formula:\n$$y = k - (ax^2 + bx + c - k).$$See what I did there? You\u2019re taking away everything. Then, we can simplify this whole mess. Let\u2019s see...\n$$y = k - ax^2 - bx - c + k,$$$$y = -ax^2 - bx - c + 2k.$$Now, let the new parabola we\u2019re making be $y = dx^2 + ex + f$, and describe it using that formula. So...\n$$y = dx^2 + ex + f.$$Then, we just substitute in the value of $y$ we found above for $y$ in that formula...\n$$-ax^2 - bx - c + 2k = dx^2 + ex + f.$$Now we can just equate squared things. For instance, the right side is $x^2$ squared and the left side is $x^2$ squared.\n\\begin{align*}\n-ax^2 &= dx^2 \\\\ \n-dx &= a\n\\end{align*}\nAnd this is just for $x^2$. Let\u2019s do another thing. We see that the $x$ powers aren\u2019t main side. It seems to suggest that it\u2019s like",
        " \nThe reflection of the vertex about the line $y=k$ moves the vertex to $(-h,k)$, which doesn\u2019t change the sum. However, the function is now flipped about the line $y=k,$ which changes the sign of $a$. Also, since $a$ is no longer multiplied by $x^2$, it must be multiplied by a constant, which is also $-1$. We could write this as $$y=-ax^2+k.$$ Since the points on the parabola are moved down by the distance $\\left|k\\right|$, the coefficients must be $$d=-a,\\quad e=-b,\\quad f=-k+c.$$ The sum of all four coefficients is then \\begin{align*} -a-a-b-b+k+c &= -a-b+c-k\\\\ &= (a+b+c)+(d+e+f)\\\\ &= (a+b+c)-3k, \\end{align*} which we can simplify to $-3k$. Note that if we substitute in $k=-\\frac{b}{2a}$, then we get an answer of $0$, but that value doesn\u2019t make sense because we have that in the problem as the equation for the vertex\u2019s $y$-coordinate. The other possible answer is $\\boxed{-b}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -b. I hope it is correct. \nThere is a formula to transfer any quadratic equation into vertex form, which is\ny = a(x - h)\u00b2 + k\nSo, if we have a parabola in standard form y = ax\u00b2 + bx + c, we can apply this formula to get y = a(x\u00b2 - h) + k. Now, we want to change this parabola so that its vertex is (h, k), and to achieve this, we can rewrite it as y = -a(x\u00b2 - h) + k.\nAnd then, we can reflect the parabola around the line y = k. For any point (x, y1) on the parabola, the corresponding point (x, -y1) will be the point on the reflected parabola. Therefore, the parabola will change its form to y = -a(x\u00b2 - h) - k, which is a new parabola.\nWe can see that now, a changes to -a, h remains the same, and k changes to -k. So we can see that d = -a, it"
