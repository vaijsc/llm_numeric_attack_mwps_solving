        " 1\nThis problem can be expressed algebraically as $x+y=32,$ and $xy=35.$  Since the sum of two numbers is 32, we can start by rearranging the equation $x+y=32$ to solve for one of the variables.  For example, we can rearrange the equation to solve for $x,$ getting $$x=32-y.$$Substituting this expression for $x$ into the equation $xy=35,$ we can then solve for $y,$ getting $$35=32y-y^2.$$Rearranging the quadratic equation $y^2-32y+35=0$ will reveal the solutions for $y,$ which are $y=5$ and $y=7$.  Since the difference between the numbers has to be positive, the only acceptable solution is $y=7.$  Therefore, the expression for $x$ that is substituted into any of the given equations will have $x=25,$ the value that is appropriate for $x$ since the problem asks for the positive difference between the numbers.\nSince we have found the values of both $x$ and $y,$ we can now simply calculate the positive difference between the numbers to find our final answer, which is $$x-y=25-7=\\boxed{18}.$$ We should try to apply it if you have time, and mind sharing that your answer is 18 at the end.

        " The solution of the given problem is $5$.\nSolution:\nWe are given that the sum of two numbers is $32$ and their product is $35$. The concept here is to denote the numbers $x$ and $y$ for ease.\nAs per given information\n\\begin{gather}\nx+y=32\\\\\nxy=35\n\\end{gather}We would solve the equation. In order to solve the equations, we make use of the process of elimination.\n$$xy=35$$ Since $xy$ can be rewritten as $(x+y)-(x+y)$ Subtracting $xy$ from both sides of $x+y=32$, to get,\n$$32-(xy)=0$$ Hence, we can simplify this further by using $xy=35$.\n$$xy=35 \\implies 32-(35)=0 \\implies -3=0$$Now we have both equations equal to $0$, so this means our values of $x$ and $y$ are the square root of $0$. That is, $x=0, y=0$.\nSince we are given that the numbers are positive. We should thus use the positive roots. From the given $x+y=32$.\n\\begin{align}\n&x+y=32\\\\\n&x=32-y\n\\end{align} The values cannot be $0$ because we cannot find positive difference between $0$ and $0$. Let the value for $y$ be $-7$. However, we know that y is positive so we get $y=5$.\nFrom above expression,\n\\begin{align}\nx=32-y\\\\\nx=32-5\\\\\nx=27\n\\end{align}Thus, the values of $x$ and $y$ are $27$ and $5$ respectively. Now, we should figure out what the positive difference is between these values.\n\\begin{gather}\n|x-y|=|27-5|\\\\\n|x-y|=|22|\n\\end{gather}We found the positive difference between $x$ and $y$ to be $\\boxed{22}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 22.

        " To solve this problem, we can start by setting up the given information in equations.\nWe know that the sum of the numbers is 32. This means that if we set one number equal to x, the other number is 32 - x.\nWe also know that the product of the two numbers is 35. Using the above notation, we can set the equation:\nx*(32 - x) = 35\nNow we can solve the equation for x.\nMultiplying and rearranging, we get:\nx^2 - 32x + 35 = 0\nFactoring the quadratic expression, we get:\n(x - 5)(x - 7) = 0\nThis tells us that x is either 5 or 7.\nIf x = 5, then 32 - x = 27 and we have solutions 5 and 27.\nIf x = 7, then 32 - x = 25 and we have solutions 7 and 25.\nComparing both pairs of numbers, we see that one number is always smaller than the other number, so the positive difference between the numbers will always be the same.\nLet\u2019s calculate the positive difference for each pair of numbers:\nFor the pair 5 and 27, the positive difference is 27 - 5 = 22.\nFor the pair 7 and 25, the positive difference is 25 - 7 = 18.\nCan you guess which of the pairs provides the answer? It should be obvious that the positive difference is 18, so the correct answer is:\nThe positive difference between the numbers is 18. The numbers are 7 and 25.

        " To calculate the difference between the two numbers, we need to subtract the smaller number from the larger number. To do so, we need to find the different two numbers.\nLet the two numbers be x and y. We know that x + y = 32 (sum) and xy = 35 (product).\n### Solution: First, we can find the possible values of x and y. Since both x and y are natural numbers, we can eliminate negative values. \nThe only positive integer solutions are x = 5 and y = 27 and x = 7 and y = 25.\nIn both cases, y > x, so to calculate the positive difference between the numbers, we will subtract x from y:\ny - x = 27 - 5 = 22 or 25 - 7 = 18.\nThe positive difference between the numbers is 18. \n### Correct Answer: 18\nExplanation: We find the two possible values of x and y: x = 5, y = 27; x = 7, y = 25. We subtract x from y in both cases to get the positive difference of 22 (27 - 5) or 18 (25 - 7), respectively. Therefore, the positive difference between the numbers is 18. \n### Additional Tips:\nUse the given information to break down the problem into smaller parts. Start with the sum of two numbers, which helps you find the two possible values of x and y. Then, find the difference between the two numbers, which is the positive difference between the original two numbers. Make sure to solve for both possible values of x and y to cover all possibilities. This problem requires you to apply problem-solving strategies such as analysis, pattern recognition, and logical thinking to arrive at the correct solution. If you\u2019re having trouble with word problems like this, practice using these strategies will help you become more comfortable solving problems step by step. Emeritus Variant: Initially, try to memorize the possible solutions x = 5, y = 27 and x = 7, y = 25, and then work through the problem.\n### TAGS:\nAdvanced Math, Algebra, Solve for the positive difference between the numbers, Word Problems for College Students or High School Students, Solve Problem 32, Sum and Product of Two Numbers, Free Online Math Help, Word Problem Help, Math Problems for Practice\n###\n### Related Resources:\nUniversity of Phoenix | Advanced Math Activities | Algebra for High School Students | Math Word Problems |",
        " \nLet x be the first number.\nThe sum of two numbers is 32, so the second number will be 32 - x.\nThe product of the two numbers is 35, so we have:\nx * (32-x) = 35\nExpand:\nx * 32 - x * x = 35\nRearrange:\nx^2 - 32x + 35 = 0\nFactor:\n(x - 7)(x - 5) = 0\nx = 7 or x = 5\nSince x is the first number, it must be 5 (the other one is 7 - 5 = 2).\nThe positive difference between 5 and 7 is 7 - 5 = 2.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2. I hope it is correct.  #### CCC \u03b5eker codepostercodeposterly----- ```\n### ",
