        " We are asked to find the length of the segment joining the points (1, 2) and (-8, -10). We can use the distance formula to do this.

Plugging in the given values, we have $$distance= \\sqrt{(-8-1)^2+(-10-2)^2}=\\sqrt{(-9)^2+(-12)^2}=\\sqrt{81+144}=\\sqrt{225}=15$$. Alternative method: You can also think of it this way. We know that the distance between two points (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of length |x_2-x_1| and |y_2-y_1|.
