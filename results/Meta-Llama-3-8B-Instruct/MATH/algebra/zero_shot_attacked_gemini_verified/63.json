It is a well known formula for finding the discriminant of the quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$; it is given by $b^2-4ac$. In our case, $a = 2, b = 63$ and $c=6$. So the discriminant is $63^2-4\\times 2 \\times 6 = 3969-48=3921$. The product of the squares of the solutions is given by $3921/4 = 931.25$. Therefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{931.25}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 931.25. I hope it is correct.  https://g FYCvl4K3&action=autoplay&fId=587323:0:0;xetcV6wd  kotlin like.
