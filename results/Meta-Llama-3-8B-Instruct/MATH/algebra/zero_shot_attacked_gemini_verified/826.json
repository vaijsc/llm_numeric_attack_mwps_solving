        " Let\u2019s use good old-fashioned algebra to find the coordinates of $M$. We know that the $x$-coordinate of $M$ is the average of the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$: $m = \\frac{a+c}{2}.$\nSimilarly, the $y$-coordinate of $M$ is the average of the $y$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$: $n = \\frac{b+d}{2}.$\nNext, we move $A$ up and right, so its new coordinates are $(a+14,b+20)$. Similarly, we move $B$ down and right, so its new coordinates are $(c+3,d-4)$.\nThe new midpoint $M'$ is defined as the average of these new coordinates:\n\\begin{align*}\nm' &= \\frac{a+c+14+3}{2} = m+\\frac{17}{2},\\\\\nn' &= \\frac{b+d+20-4}{2} = n+8.\n\\end{align*}\nThe problem asks for the distance $d(M, M')$, which is the distance between the point $\\boxed{(m, n)}$ and the point $(m', n')$.
