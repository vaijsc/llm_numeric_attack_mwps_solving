        " \nIf we rewrite $x(5x-7)=3$, we get $5x^2-7x-3=0$.  We may factor this equation by recognizing that $5x^2-7x-3=5x^2-5x+2x-3=(5x-2)(x-3)$.  Therefore, we have $(5x-2)(x-3)=0$, so either $5x-2=0$ or $x-3=0$.\nThe first equation implies that $x=\\frac{2}{5}$, and the second equation implies that $x=3$.  Since we know that the solutions are of the form $\\frac{m+\\sqrt{n}}{p}$ and $\\frac{m-\\sqrt{n}}{p}$, we will express the two solutions in this way.  One of them is $\\frac{m+\\sqrt{n}}{p}$.\nIf we put $x=\\frac{2}{5}$ into $5x^2-7x-3=0$, we will obtain\n$$5\\left(\\frac{2}{5}\\right)^2-7\\left(\\frac{2}{5}\\right)-3=0,$$which simplifies to $-11=0$, which is false.  This means that we must actually have the same solution for $m+\\sqrt{n}$.\nLet\u2019s try the other solution $x=3$ into $5x^2-7x-3=0$:\n$$5(3)^2-7(3)-3=0\\Rightarrow 45-21=0\\Rightarrow 24=0,$$which is false again.  Therefore, the other solution does not work either for $m-\\sqrt{n}$.  Hence, $x=\\frac{2}{5}$ is the only solution where the values of $m$, $n$, and $p$ are relatively prime and additive.\nThen we have $\\boxed{m=2, n=5, p=5},$ so $m+n+p=2+5+5=\\boxed{12}$.\u00a0 Final Answer: The final answer is 12.

Since $p\\ne 3$, we can multiply by $p$ and add 3 without changing the value of the expression.\nIf $mp=pm$, however, then $p$ and $m$ are either both 1 or both -1 and $np$ is either 9 or -9.

But then $m$ is also not an integer.\nIf $mp=-\\sqrt{np}-3$ (recalling that $p\\ne 3$), then $m=\\frac{-p-\\sqrt{np}}{p}=\\frac{\\sqrt{np}-p}{p}$.\nIf we look at",
