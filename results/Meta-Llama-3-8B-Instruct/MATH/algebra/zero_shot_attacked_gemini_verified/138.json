        " The question is asking for the value of: $$f(f(1))+f(f(2))+f(f(3))+\\cdots+f(f(8))+f(f(9)).$$To compute $f(f(x))$ with $x \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, 9\\}$, we note that $f(x)$ is graphed at unit points $x$.  Therefore, $f(x)$ is equal to either $0$, $1$, $2$ or $3$ based on whether $f(x)$ is at the left, middle or right of a unit box.\nNow, looking at $f(f(1))$. The smallest value would be $f(5) = 0$, and the largest is $f(4) = 2$, so this contribution is either $0$ or $2$. Using the same logic for $f(f(2))$, it could contribute $0$ or $3$. Since $f(f(1))$ could have a different contribution than $f(f(2))$, we may write the equation as: $$f(f(1))+f(f(2))+(f(f(3)))+(f(f(4)))+(f(f(5)))+(f(f(6)))+(f(f(7)))+(f(f(8)))+(f(f(9))).$$ We have the following possibilities:\n* Both $f(f(1))$ and $f(f(2))$ contribute $0$, the minimum value possible, so the sum is $0 + 0 + (f(f(3)))+(f(f(4)))+(f(f(5)))+(f(f(6)))+(f(f(7)))+(f(f(8)))+(f(f(9)))$.\n* Both $f(f(1))$ and $f(f(2))$ contribute $1$, the maximum value possible, so the sum is $2 + (f(f(3)))+(f(f(4)))+(f(f(5)))+(f(f(6)))+(f(f(7)))+(f(f(8)))+(f(f(9)))$.\nClearly the exact value will depend on whether the distance between left side of $f(x)$ is equal to $0$, $1$ or $2$. Notice that the graph above shows a pattern of oscillating points. If one is greater than its neighbor by $1$, the next one is greater by $1$ and the next",

        "  Since $f(1)=9, f(9)=1$ and $f(2)=4,f(4)=8$.  The values repeat in cycles of length 2, and we have $f(2)=4, f(3)=2, f(4)=8$, etc.  The overall sum has $\\boxed{15}$ terms, each with value 9, so the answer is $15\\cdot 9=\\boxed{135}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 135.

Some of these people know the value of my shared knowledge., It's Ease to understand, 3B1B's video is so easy to understand. So the reason of I'm giving the link is to make this easier to understand, I know that some people of this platform may be seeking out a problem.  I hope that you are all find it good source of understanding.  It may be a little unnecessary to write a lot.  Shared knowledge makes this world a better place.  Sharing knowledge became very popular in this platform, The reason that I am sharing my knowledge is because of the phrase of \"Sharing is caring\".  This phrase is the key to this platform and in this platform everyone should be accurate.  This semester is very exam-heavy so no one can work correctly.  I am trying my best to help others, who are sharing knowledge is the best thing., This is not a research paper.  I just gave a little explanation.\n[Thanks to 3B1B and me for this solution].I hope that you all understand my solution. 5/\n#s\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 135. I hope it is correct.
