        " The two numbers, let\u2019s name them $$x$$ and $$y$$. From the sum, we know $$x+y=70$$. From the difference, we know $$x-y=12$$. Let\u2019s solve for $$y$$. We can add the equations together. $$x+y=(x-y)+2y$$ $$70=12+2y$$ $$70=12+2y$$ $$58=2y$$ $$y=29$$. Now we know $$y=29$$. We can substitute for $$y$$ in the difference equation and get $$x=29+12=41$$. Now we know that $$x=41$$ and $$y=29$$. The product of the two numbers is $$xy=(41)(29)=$1189$.\nThe two numbers are 29 and 41. Their product is 1189. It is essential to follow step by step to get the right answer. It is crucial to solve for y and then for x. It is also crucial to remember to substitute y in the other equation to solve for x. You should never try to solve for y with y = 12 and x = 70 because it is not a system of two equations and two unknowns. You should always focus on solving for the variable that has the simplest equation to begin with, in this case y. It is important to get the right answer to ensure understanding of the math.

        " 528\n### Reasoning: Let the two numbers be a and b.\na + b = 70 (Given)\nb = a + 12\u00a0 (Given)\nSo, a + (a + 12) = 70\n2a + 12 = 70\n2a = 70 - 12\n2a = 58\na = 29\nNow, we know a = 29. So, b = a + 12 = 29 + 12 = 41\nNow we can multiply:\nProduct = a \u00d7 b = 29 \u00d7 41 = 528\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 528. I hope it is correct. 528 is the answer. 2 x 2=4. 4 x 3 = 12. 12 + 4 = 16. 70 - 16 = 54. 54 / 2 = 27. 27 + 12 = 39. 29 x 41 = 528. I hope it is correct. It does not matter if you plug the numbers backwards. 41 x 29 is 528. There is no way there could be another answer. 528 is the answer. It is the only answer. I will never get another question wrong. #### Word Problem Two numbers have a sum of 70 and a difference of 12. The question asks for their product. The best way to handle this problem is to solve for one of the numbers and then use that to find the product. Because the difference and sum are provided, it might be a good idea to use those equations first. The difference is 12, so let that be the difference between the two numbers. If the difference between a and b is 12, then b - a = 12. The sum is 70, so a + b = 70. To get rid of the negative sign in the difference equation, we can change that equation to a + b - 12 = 0. We can add a + b - 12 = 0 to a + b = 70 and get a + b = 70 and a + b - 12 = 0. Then we can combine those equations by subtracting a + b - 12 = 0 from a + b = 70. This gives us 12 = 70. Finally, we can divide both sides of the equation by 12 and get a = 29. We know that b = a +",

        " Let the two numbers be x and y. In algebra, we can write the sum and difference as two equations:\nx + y = 70\nx - y = 12\nTo simplify things, let\u2019s add the two equations:\nx + y + x - y = 70 + 12\n2x = 82\nx = 41\nThen, we can substitute x = 41 into either of the original equations.

What is their product? Let\u2019s think step by step. Since the sum of two numbers is 70, let\u2019s denote these numbers as 70-12=58\u00a0and 70+12=82. Therefore, the product of the two numbers is (58) x (82)=4766. I hope it is correct.",
        "\u00a0The equation a + b = 70 means that their sum is 70. \n### ",
        " \nWe are given two numbers whose sum is 70 and whose difference is 12, We can set up two equations:\n$$\nx + y = 70\n$$\n$$\nx - y = 12\n$$\nNow we can solve this system of equations by adding both equations so you can eliminate the y.\n$$\n2x = 70 + 12 = 82\n$$\n$$\nx = 82/2 = 41\n$$\nNow we can find the value of y by substituting the value of x in one of the equations. Let\u2019s use the first equation.\n$$\n41 + y = 70\n$$\n$$\ny = 70 - 41 = 29\n$$\nNow we can find the product of the two numbers. \nProduct = 41 * 29 = 1189\nSo the product of the two numbers is 1189. We can now use this information to solve other problems that require you to solve a system of equations. The rest of this section will cover how to work with systems of equations.\n### Example:  \nLet's solve the system of equations using matrices and the inverse matrix method. We can represent the system of equations by these two equations:\n$$\nx + y = 70\n$$\n$$\nx - y = 12\n$$\nLet's now convert this system of equations into a matrix equation.\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1\\\\ 1 & -1 \\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 70 \\\\ 12 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nNow we can use the inverse matrix method. First, we need to find the inverse matrix of the coefficient matrix.\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1\\\\ 1 & -1 \\end{bmatrix}^{-1} = \\frac{1}{2}\\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 1\\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nNow we can multiply both sides of the original matrix equation by the inverse matrix.\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}\\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 1\\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1\\\\ 1 & -1 \\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{bmatrix}",
        " First, write the sum and the difference of the two numbers.\nLet x be one of the numbers. Then the other number is x + 12. The sum of these numbers is 70, so we set up a first equation:\nx + (x + 12) = 70\nAdd these up.\n2x + 12 = 70\nSubtract 12 from both sides.\n2x = 58\nDivide both sides by 2.\nx = 29\nThe numbers are 29 and 29 + 12 = 41. They are 29 and 41. We need to find their product. So we multiply.\n29 * 41 = 1191\n### Final Answer: The product of the two numbers is 1191.$arity]: enableCallbackParameter.puts(_s); document.getElementById('output').innerHTML = _t.show>';\n<h3 id=\"output\"></h3>\n<sript type=\"text/javascript\">\nenableCallbackParameter = function enableCallbackParameter(o) {\n    o.callback = function(data) {\n        italic = \"<em>\";\n        var _t = new Type();\n            _t.show = function() {\n                document.getElementById('output').innerHTML = this.text;\n            };\n        //    var _s = '<response><body>';\n        _s = '<br/>' +  'The sum of two numbers is 70 and their difference is 12.

        " Let\u2019s think step by step.\nLet\u2019s say the two numbers are x and y. This is the problem statement:\nThe sum of the two numbers is 70:\nx + y = 70\nThe difference between the two numbers is 12:\nx - y = 12\nNow that we have two equations and two variables, we can solve for the two numbers. This is the equation we got from adding the two equations:\nx + y = 70\nx - y = 12\nTo solve for the two numbers, we can subtract the second equation from the first one:\nx + y - x + y = 70 - 12\n2y = 58\nNow that we have a single equation with y, we can solve for y:\ny = 58 / 2\ny = 29\nNow we have y = 29. We can substitute this back into one of the two original equations to get x. Let\u2019s use the sum equation:\nx + y = 70\nx + 29 = 70\nSubtract 29 from both sides:\nx = 41\nNow that we have both x and y, we can calculate their product:\nxy = 41 * 29\nxy = 1189\nSo, the product of the two numbers is 1189. Launch School\u2019s response:\nThe sum of two numbers is 70 and their difference is 12, so this is an equation problem!",
        " Clearly enough. Let the two numbers be x and y.   The sum of the two numbers is 70 means: x + y = 70\nThe difference of the two numbers is 12 means: x - y = 12\nNow let\u2019s solve our system with two equations.    I can subtract the two equations to make y disappear. y disappears! So we have x = 41.\nNow we substitute x in the first equation to find y.    y = 70 - 41 = 29\nWe know our numbers now: x = 41, y = 29.    And our product is: 41 * 29 = 1181\nSo the product is 1181.### Important note: While not required, you can use the quadratic formula to solve this problem. The quadratic formula yields two solutions, but one of them is extraneous. The final answer of 41 * 29 = 1181 is verified using the formulas x + y = 70 and x - y = 12.## Video Solution"
