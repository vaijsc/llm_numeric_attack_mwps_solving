I hope it is correct.  Because sometimes my math prime site, mathproblemsolving.com, doesn't work properly. I apologize for the inconsistencies. And I hope my answer is correct. And I am impressed by the LaTex coding! It is not an easy task. And for the math LaTeX, the trick is knowing what symbols you can use in your post, such as [],/, etc. And after writing the code, you have to use preview to check your code before submitting the post. And then click on \u201cTex\u201d button in the editing area to make sure your math equation or expression is rendered properly. So, LaTex coding requires practice and the learning experience.\nAnd for math problems, it requires practice, patience, and attention to detail. Because when you are solving a math problem, you have to keep an eye on the details and be patient to find the correct solution. And for the math education, I believe that it is important for students to learn the basics of math, such as algebra and geometry, and then build upon those foundations. And with the practices, the math skills will become automatic and you can solve complex math problems.\nMathematics is a beautiful subject, and it requires a lot of patience and practice to learn it properly. And with persistence and dedication, you can master the math skills and use it to solve many real-world problems. And, with the LaTex coding, the math expressions can be displayed beautifully on the website, which is an added bonus! Therefore, LaTex coding is an essential skill for mathematicians and math educators to learn.",

        " \nFirst, we notice that $x\\neq -6$ since there is no $x+6$ in the denominator. Plugging in $x$ for everything is not practical for us, so we will decide to get rid of all of the fractions. This way, we will have an easier time simplifying the expressions.\nHere\u2019s how we get rid of it: We multiply both sides by $x+6$. That gives us:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{9-4x}{x+6}\\cdot(x+6)&=9(x+6)\\\\\n9-4x&=9x+54\\\\\n\\end{align*}\nThe next thing that we do is to simplify both sides.

To solve this equation we must get both sides equal to each other. Let\u2019s start by taking the reciprocal of both sides. This gets rid of the fraction. One thing that we must remember is that what we do to one side of the equation we must do to the other side.
