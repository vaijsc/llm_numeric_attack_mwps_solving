        " Step 1. Suppose $\\sqrt{26}<k$ for some positive integer $k$. In other words, $\\sqrt{26}$ rounded to the nearest integer should be less than $k$. Since $26<36$, this means that $k$ should be less than $6$.  Therefore, if we consider that $\\sqrt{26}\\approx4.63$ and $26=17^2$, it is clear that we can choose $k=5$ to satisfy the above inequality.",
        " The answer is 6.\nFor the first number, we evaluate the ceiling function first.  This means take the number and find the ceiling of it, which is the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to the number.  So $\\left\\lceil \\sqrt{67} \\right\\rceil = \\boxed{8}$.\nIn the second number, we must take the floor of the number.
