Since 2 is even, 192 is divisible by 2.\nThe divisibility test for 4 is to check if the last two digits are divisible by 4. In this case, the last two digits are 92, which are not divisible by 4. Hence, 192 is not divisible by 4.\nFinally, the divisibility test for 8 is to check if the last three digits are divisible by 8. In this case, the last three digits are 192, which are divisible by 8. Hence, 192 is divisible by 8.\nThe conclusion is that 192 is divisible by 2 and 8, but not by 4. One can use these principles to make an easier determination.\n### Conclusion: \nUsing these basic principles of divisibility, one can simplify and make more evident whether the",

Then, we can increase each integer by 2 and multiply it by 20.\n#### Let\u2019s say the four integers are n, n+1, n+2, and n+3.\nSo, the sum of the original set is 62, so we can write an equation:\nn + (n+1) + (n+2) + (n+3) = 62\nCombine like terms:\n4n + 6 = 62\nSubtract 6 from both sides:\n4n = 56\nDivide both sides by 4:\nn = 14\nSo, the original set is 14, 15, 16, and 17.\nNow, we increase each integer by 2, so we get:\n14 + 2 = 16\n15 + 2 = 17\n16 + 2 = 18\n17 + 2 = 19\nNext, we multiply each integer by 20:\n16 \u00d7 20 = 320\n17 \u00d7 20 = 340\n18 \u00d7 20 = 360\n19 \u00d7 20 = 380\nFinally, we add the four numbers:\n320 + 340 + 360 + 380 = 1400\nSo, the sum of the new set of integers is 1400. If you want to say you have the final answer out of your way or this isn't the end, you can leave it out.\nThe most important thing is that you fully understand how to find the sum of the new set of integers. Once you have it, you can apply it to any set of four consecutive integers where the sum is known and each integer is increased by 2 and then multiplied by 20. The end\n### Final Answer: The sum of the new set of integers is 1400. If you want to say you have the final answer out of your way or this isn't the end, you can leave it out. To ensure you fully understand how to find the sum of the new set of integers. Once you have it, you can apply it to any set of four consecutive integers where the sum is known and each integer is increased by 2 and then multiplied by 20. Final! Thank you!

        " Let\u2019s start.\n Suppose the original set of integers is $x,x+1,x+2,x+3.$\nThe sum of this set is $x+(x+1)+(x+2)+(x+3) = 4x+6 = 62,$ which implies that $x=14,$ and the set is $14,15,16,17.$\nAfter increasing each integer by 2, we get $16,17,18,19.$\nThen, after multiplying each integer by 20, we get $320,340,360,380.$\nThe sum of this new set of integers is $320+340+360+380 = \\boxed{1,360}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 1,360.
