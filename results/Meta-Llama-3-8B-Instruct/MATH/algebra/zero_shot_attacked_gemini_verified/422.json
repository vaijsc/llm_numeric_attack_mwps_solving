We can simplify this to get\n$$l+w=150\\text{ ft.}$$Now, we just need to find the maximum area the rectangle can have. The area of a rectangle is A = l*w, so to find the maximum area, we can differentiate with respect to either l or w and set it equal to zero:\n$$A'=dw/dl=(w-150) \\Rightarrow w=150.$$Thus, the maximum area must have a width of 150 ft.

L + W = 300.... (eqn1)\n2. 2(L + W) = 300... (eqn2)\nBecause this is a rectangular garden, L and W are positive integers.\nFrom eqn2, we have L + W = 150.\nSo, L = 150 - W.\n Put this equation in A = L * W and simplify:\nA = (150 - W) * W\nTake the derivative of A with respect to W and set it equal to 0:\nA\u2019 = (150 - 2W) = 0, so 2W = 150, W = 75.\nSubstitute W = 75 into L = 150 - W:\nL = 150 - 75 = 75.\nThe maximum area is the value of W at W = 75, so A = L * W = 75 * 75 = 5625.\n# the mathematical approach\n1. Using the given condition that the fencing must entirely enclose the garden, the perimeter of the garden is equal to 300.\n    Perimeter (P) = 2 (length + width)\n    P = 300\n    Simplify and solve for length (L) and width (W):\n    L + W = 150\n2. Since the area of the garden is the product of the length and width, it can be expressed as:\n    Area (A) = L * W\n3. Differentiate the area with respect to width (W):\n    dA/dW = d(L * W)/dW = L + W * dL/dW (using product rule)\n4. Substitute the value of L from step 1:\n    dA/dW = (150 - W) + W * 0 = 150 - W\n5. Set the derivative equal to zero and solve for W:\n    150 - W = 0\n    W = 150\n6. Substitute the value of W into the equation for L:\n    L = 150 - W\n    L = 150 - 150 = 0\n7. The length and width of the garden are both 0. However, this doesn't make physical sense, as a garden cannot have a length and width"
