The goal is to get this equation in the form $y=a(x-h)^2+k$, where (h, k) is the vertex of the parabola. We do this by moving any constant term to the other side. \\begin{align*} y &= 5x^2 - 12x - 15 \\\\ y + 15 &= 5x^2 - 12x \\\\ &= 5(x^2 - 2\\cdot x \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{5}} \\cdot \\dfrac{3}{\\sqrt{5}} + \\left(\\dfrac{3}{\\sqrt{5}} \\right)^2 ) - 15 \\\\ &= 5 \\left( x - \\dfrac{3}{\\sqrt{5}} \\right)^2 - \\dfrac{9}{5} \\end{align*} Hence the vertex is at $\\boxed{\\bigg(m, n\\bigg) = \\left(\\dfrac{3}{\\sqrt{5}}, \\dfrac{9}{5}\\right)}$.

        " By factoring the quadratic in standard form, the coefficient $(ax^2+bx+c)$ yields vertex form $(x-h)^2+k$, where $(h,k)$ is the parabola\u2019s vertex. Consequently, this coefficient becomes $(a(x^2-2hx+h^2))+k=ax^2+bx+c$. Thus: We can set $a=5$, $-2ah=12$, and $ah^2+k=-15$. Plugging in these terms yields $5x^2-12x-15$: \\begin{align*} 5&=a\\\\\n-12&=-2ah\\\\\n-15&=ah^2+k \\end{align*}Next we proceed to solve for $h$: $$-12=-2ah=-2(5)y=-10y.$$\nClearly $-y=12/10=6/5$. Thus $y=-6/5$.\nNow let $\\boxed{m=\\frac{12}{10}}$ as the value of $m$ is the same $h$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 6/5 + (-3) = 3/5=-\\frac{6}{5}.

To identify the vertex of a parabola, which is represented by the equation $y=ax^2+bx+c$, one needs to factor the quadratic equation into its vertex form $(x-h)^2+k$.\n2. To identify the vertex, solve for $h$ by using the following equations: \\begin{align*} -2ah&=b, and\\\\\nah^2+k&=c. \\end{align*}\n### Relationship between solution and problem:\n1.

The student will definitely answer YES, even though they are not getting what I want them to get. Because they can do it! And then, I ask them: are you sure you know how to complete the square? They could look at it a little bit but they don\u2019t really know how to do it. It\u2019s not easy to do it. That\u2019s my point. If they say that they don\u2019t know how to complete the square, then no problem. I can help them or give them a hint. That\u2019s the key. I want to encourage my students to ask for help and not give up. Or, I can give them a few guidelines so at least they can understand it.\nCompleting the square is a powerful tool because it converts these quadratic equations into vertex form.

        " I believe the vertex of the parabola is at the point where the derivative of the parabola equals zero.  So we take the derivative and set it equal to zero.  Let f(x) = 5x^2 - 12x - 15.  Then, f'(x) = 10x - 12 = 0. Then, 10x = 12, and x = 1.  Then we compute y by putting x = 1 in the original equation.  y = 5(1)^2 - 12(1) - 15 = -22.  Then the vertex is at (1, -22), and m+n = 1 + (-22) = -21.\nGreat job! You\u2019re absolutely right. You correctly found the vertex by setting the derivative equal to zero, and then computing the $y$-coordinate by plugging $x=1$ into the original equation.

        "To find the vertex of the parabola given by the equation \\(y = 5x^2 - 12x - 15\\), we can use the vertex formula for a parabola in the standard form \\(y = ax^2 + bx + c\\). The x-coordinate of the vertex is given by the formula:\n\\[\nx = -\\frac{b}{2a}\n\\]\nIn our equation, we have:\n- \\(a = 5\\)\n- \\(b = -12\\)\n  \nNow we can calculate \\(m\\), the x-coordinate of the vertex:\n\\[\nm = -\\frac{-12}{2 \\cdot 5} = \\frac{12}{10} = \\frac{6}{5}\n\\]\nNext, we need to find the y-coordinate of the vertex, denoted as \\(n\\). We can substitute \\(m\\) back into the equation to find \\(n\\):\n\\[\nn = 5\\left(\\frac{6}{5}\\right)^2 - 12\\left(\\frac{6}{5}\\right) - 15\n\\]\nCalculating \\(\\left(\\frac{6}{5}\\right)^2\\):\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{6}{5}\\right)^2 = \\frac{36}{25}\n\\]\nNow substituting this back into the equation:\n\\[\nn = 5 \\cdot \\frac{36}{25} - 12 \\cdot \\frac{6}{5} - 15\n\\]\nCalculating \\(5 \\cdot \\frac{36}{25}\\):\n\\[\n5 \\cdot \\frac{36}{25} = \\frac{180}{25} = \\frac{36}{5}\n\\]\nNext, calculate \\(12 \\cdot \\frac{6}{5}\\):\n\\[\n12 \\cdot \\frac{6}{5} = \\frac{72}{5}\n\\]\nNow substitute these values into the equation for \\(n\\):\n\\[\nn = \\frac{36}{5} - \\frac{72}{5} - 15\n\\]\nCombine the fractions:\n\\[\nn = \\frac{36 - 72}{5} - 15 = \\frac{-36}{5} - 15\n\\]\nConvert \\(15\\) to a fraction with a denominator of \\(5\\):\n\\[\n15 = \\frac{75}{5}\n\\]\nNow we can combine the terms:\n\\[\nn = \\frac{-36}{5} - \\frac{75}{5} = \\frac{-111}{5}\n\\]\nNow we have \\(m = \\frac{6}{5}\\) and \\(n = \\frac{-111}{5}\\). We need to find \\(m + n\\):\n\\[\nm + n = \\frac{6}{5} + \\frac{-111}{5} = \\frac{6 - 111}{5} = \\frac{-105}{5} = -21\n\\]\nThus, the final result is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{-21}\n\\]"
