        " \nThe difference between consecutive perfect squares is always equal to the square of the integer just above the difference between the two squares. \nFor example, the difference between 4^2=16 and 5^2=25 is 9, which is the square of the integer just above 4, which is 3.\nIn this case, since the difference is 91, we need to find an integer n such that n^2+1=91. To do so, we can factor 91 as (7)(13), which means we can write 91 as 7(13) or 3(31). Thus, 7^2=49 and 8^2=64 have a difference of 15. Then, we can add 8 to both sides of 7^2=49 to get 7^2+8^2=15^2, which means we need to add 62 to both sides to get 7^2+8^2+62=91^2, or 15^2+8^2=91^2+63. \nThis means that 15^2=15(15)=(15+7)(15-7)=16(8)=64^2-7^2, or 15(15)=16*8 .

        " )\n\nAnd we did the following steps:\n1. We started by taking the positive difference between two consecutive perfect squares as the given information '\u2026is 91'.\n### Understanding: A perfect square is a number that is the square of an integer. For example, 4 is a perfect square because it is the square of the integer 2 (2 x 2 = 4).\nSo, we framed the equation:\n(Perfect Square A) ^2 - (Perfect Square B) ^2 = 91\nAccording to the algorithm of difference of squares:\n(x - y)(x + y) = x^2 - y^2\nWe applied the values:\n(x - y)(x + y) = 91\nOr, let Perfect Square A = x and Perfect Square B = y. Now we have:\n(x - y)(x + y) = 91\nFind the factors of 91: 91 = 1 * 91, 7 * 13\nWe will take these factors:\n1 * 91 = 0\n7 * 13 = 91\nNow, choose 'x' as a perfect square, for example, 8, 9, 10\nwhen 'x' is 9\n(x - y)(x + y) = 91\n((9) ^2 - (y) ^2) = 91\n(81 - y^2) = 91\ny^2 = 81 - 91\ny^2 = 10\ny = \u00b1\u221a10\ny = 3\n(y - x) = 3 - 9 (- 6)\ny = 10\nBut, x and y both are squares. So, the value of 'x' will be equal to y. Let's have an integer 'n' where n^2 = 9, as both x and y should be equal.\nThere are several bases to 9. 3^2 = 9\n#### So, the perfect square is 9.\n##### Now, y^2 = x^2 = 9. By definition of the square root:\ny = \u00b1\u221a9 = \u00b13\nWe need the greater one, so we take y = +3, since we are talking about perfect squares:\ny = 3",
        " \nFirst, we want to know when 2 consecutive perfect squares differ by 91. If we denote the squares $n^2$ and $(n+1)^2$, we have the difference between them equal to $91$ just by expanding and simplifying:\n$$(n+1)^2-n^2=91\\implies n^2+2n+1-n^2=91\\implies 2n+1=91\\implies 2n=90\\implies n=45.$$\nThis gives us the greater perfect square $(45+1)^2=\\boxed{1000}.$\nThis note will serve as a guide for you as you review this material later.
