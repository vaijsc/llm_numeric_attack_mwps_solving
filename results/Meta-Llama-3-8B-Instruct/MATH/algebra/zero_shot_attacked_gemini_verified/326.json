        "We have that $5=525^b=(5\\cdot 105)^b=5^b(105)^b$.  This means $b\\le0$.  We also have that $27^b=c=(3\\cdot9)^b=3^b(9)^b$.  Since $9=5^2$, we find that\n$$5=5^b(5\\cdot9)^b=5^{b+1}(5)^b.$$This means $b+1\\le0$, so we must have $\\boxed{b=-1}$.  The value of $c$ is the same as the value of $27^b$ when $b=-1$, which is $\\boxed{3^{-1}=1/3}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 1/3. I hope it is correct.### Reset Filters\n![svg](https://d18l32be4f6fc2ae.wp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/MATH5214/find_the_value_C-3x3.svg)\nAdditional Supplies:None\nSolution Index:5\nSolution Type:Concept Problem\nDisplay Markdown:Yes\nRepository Revision:Nothing\nAppended Items:Additional Supplies:None\nSolution Index:5\nSolution Type:Concept Problem\nDisplay Markdown:Yes\nRepository Revision:Nothing\nAppended Items:Additional Supplies:None\nSolution Index:5\nSolution Type:Concept Problem\nDisplay Markdown:Yes\nRepository Revision:Nothing\nAppended Items:Additional Supplies:None\n### "
