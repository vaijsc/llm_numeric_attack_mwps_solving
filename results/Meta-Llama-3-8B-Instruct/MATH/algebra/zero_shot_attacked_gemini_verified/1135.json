        " \n### 1. $6x^2 + x - 8$ is a quadratic polynomial in x. According to the question, we need to determine the greatest integer value of x for which $6x^2 + x - 8 < 0$ is true. So we need to consider the parabola $\\mathbf f(x) = 6x^2 + x - 8$ and try to find the maximum integer value of x such that $\\mathbf f(x) < 0$.  \n### 2. To do this, we need to find the zeroes of the polynomial $6x^2 + x - 8$. We can do this by factorizing it.\nLet\u2019s factorize the given quadratic polynomial. We have:$$6x^2 + x - 8=6x^2 - 3x + 4x - 8=3x(2x-1)+4(x-2)=3x(2x-1)+4(2-(2x))\\\\ =3x(2x-1)+4(2-x).$$Using the Zero-Product Property, we can factorize the right-hand side by writing two factors equal to zero: $(2x-1)(3x)+(4-2x)(3x)=0$.\n$$(2x-1)(3x)+(4-2x)(3x)=(2x-1+4-2x)(3x)=(1+3x)(3x)=0$$which implies that $3x=0$ or $1+3x=0$, giving us the zeroes $x=0$ and $x=-\\frac{1}{3}$.\n### 3. To find the maximum integer value of x such that $6x^2+x-8<0$, we should consider only the interval $\\boxed{(-\\frac{1}{3}, 0)}$ and find the greatest integer value within this interval. This is clearly -1. So the greatest integer value of x that satisfies the given inequality is x=-1.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is x=-1. I hope it is correct.  <br>Well, considering we would eventually have to add fractions, we might as well skip dealing with all that arithmetic mess.

        " C. 0\nIt\u2019s not exactly an easy problem, but I think I can solve it. The question is concerning which integer value of $x$ is the greatest for which the inequality $6x^2+x-8<0$ holds.\nLet\u2019s start by rewriting the left hand side: $$6x^2+x-8=(6x+2)(x-2).$$So, $(6x+2)(x-2)<0$. Now, there are two cases: (1) $(6x+2)<0$ and $(x-2)>0$, or (2) $(6x+2)>0$ and $(x-2)<0$.\nCase 1: $(6x+2)<0$ and $(x-2)>0$. This means that $x<-1/3$ and $x>2$. No integers satisfy this, so this case is impossible.\nCase 2: $(6x+2)>0$ and $(x-2)<0$. This means that $x>-1/3$ and $x<2$. Such an $x$ exists, and the greatest integer value for $x$ would be $x=1$.",

The expression will be negative when the factors have different signs.  They have opposite signs on the intervals $(-\\infty,-\\frac{2}{3}]\\cup[\\frac{2}{3},2]$.\n### ",
        " ### Since 6x^2 + x - 8 is a quadratic function, we can rearrange it into the standard form: $$6x^2+x-8 = 6\\left(x^2+\\frac{1}{6}x-\\frac{4}{3}\\right) = 6\\left(x^2+\\frac{1}{2}x-\\frac{1}{2}x+\\frac{2}{3}\\right) = 6\\left(\\left(x+\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^2-\\frac{1}{4}\\right)$$\nNotice that $$\\left(x+\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^2-\\frac{1}{4} < 0$$ if and only if $$-\\frac{1}{2} < x+\\frac{1}{4} < \\frac{1}{2},$$ and this is equivalent to $$\\frac{1}{4}-\\frac{1}{2} < x < \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}.$$ Thus, taking the greatest integer value of x satisfying the inequality, we get $$x = \\boxed{0}$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 0.
