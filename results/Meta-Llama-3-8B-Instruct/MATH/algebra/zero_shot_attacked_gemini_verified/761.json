        " First, we know that (a-b)^2 = a^2 \u2013 2ab + b^2. Since this problem is asking for the difference between two squared numbers, we can factor a difference as: 613^2 - 487^2 = (613+487)(613-487) Now, back to the solution above, we can simplify this by adding and subtracting the two numbers: (613+487)(613-487) = (1000)(126) = 126,000\n### Conclusion: In conclusion, the value of 613^2 - 487^2 is indeed 126,000. Hence, we can say that 613^2 - 487^2 = 126,000.\nThe number 1000 is often called the \"constant\" or \"base\" where we can do the multiplication. When we have the equation (a^2 - b^2), it allows us to factor it as (a+b)(a-b). This allows us to easily calculate the value. We can further simplify this equation by setting up the problem as (a+b)(a-b), where a is the larger number(613) and b is the smaller number(487). From there we can easily calculate the product of 613+487 and 613-487 which eventually becomes 1000 times 126. So the value of 613^2 - 487^2 is 126,000. \nThe solution is proving that a^2 - b^2 = (a+b)(a-b). This helps break down the problem into simpler addition and subtraction operations, allowing us to easily calculate the value. The factoring of the difference between two squared numbers is a useful trick that can be applied to many algebraic problems. This type of trick is known as \"factoring the difference of squares\". It's one of the basic and essential technique in algebra.  \nFinal Answer: The final answer is 126,000. I hope it is correct. \nLink:  https://www.khanacademy.org/algebra/polynomial-equations/factoring-polynomials/a/factoring-the-difference-of-squares\nUnderstanding this concept will help you solve problems involving quadratic equations, which are expressions with a squared variable, such as x^2 + 2x + 1.

For the Olympiad book, you could also include extra comments about what to look out for in this problem. For example: \"Notice that the numbers are close to symmetric integers,\" \"Realize that both terms can be factored as differences of squares,\" or \"Recognize that this is a variation of a common problem, but with slightly different numbers.\" These comments could help students notice patterns and connections between different math problems and apply them to this problem in particular.

This answer is given in the reference source. It is considered incorrect. In the Newton-Raphson method of squaring, you have to solve $(x+y)^2 - (x-y)^2 = 2xy$, meaning $x^2+2xy+y^2 - (x^2-y^2)=2xy$ or $2xy=x^2+y^2$. In this case, we have $x=613$, $y=487$. Substitute, we get $2xy=x^2+y^2$ which is $2\\cdot 487\\cdot 613=613^2+487^2$. Subtract the result from the left side we get $(613-487)(613+487)$ or $inclusive \\ space$ $126 \\times 1100$, which is $138600$. That's why the booking is considered incorrect.
