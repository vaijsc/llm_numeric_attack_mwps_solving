        " Let's start with the first term: 4022. To find the second term, we add 1010 to 4022: 4022 + 1010 = 5032. Now we have two terms: 4022 and 5032. To find the third term, we add 1010 to 5032: 5032 + 1010 = 6042. Now we have three terms: 4022, 5032, and 6042. To find the fourth term, we add 1010 to 6042: 6042 + 1010 = 7052. Now we have four terms: 4022, 5032, 6042, and 7052. To find the fifth term, we add 1010 to 7052: 7052 + 1010 = 8062. Now we have five terms: 4022, 5032, 6042, 7052, and 8062. To find the sixth term, we add 1010 to 8062: 8062 + 1010 = 9072. Now we have six terms: 4022, 5032, 6042, 7052, 8062, and 9072. To find the seventh term, we add 1010 to 9072: 9072 + 1010 = 10082. Now we have seven terms: 4022, 5032, 6042, 7052, 8062, 9072, and 10082. The sum of the sixth and seventh terms is 9072 + 10082 = 20354.",
