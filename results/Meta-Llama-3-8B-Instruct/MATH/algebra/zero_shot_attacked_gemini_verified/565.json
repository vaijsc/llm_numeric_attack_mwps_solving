Therefore, the corresponding ratio for the pine tree is (p):34. We use the cross product to find p.\n$$\n\\frac{5}{5}=\\frac{p}{34}\\qquad p=\\boxed{34}\n$$\nThe pine tree is 34 feet tall. However, the instruction said that it was next to Monica, who is 5 feet tall. Therefore, the answer is 39 feet. The pine tree is 39 feet tall. Finally, let's think about the situation. If Monica was 5 feet tall, and her shadow was 5 feet long, suppose she was standing next to the twin brother of the pine tree. His shadow would be the same length 5 feet, so we know his height would be 5 too. The corresponding ratio for his height to shadow would be 5:5.\nNow, let's think more about the new pine tree. Its height would be 34 feet, and its shadow would be 34 feet as well. If the matching ratio of the height and shadow length for his twin brother is 5:5, then the ratio of the height and shadow length for this new pine tree should be the same. 36:34.

The pine tree also has a shadow, but we don't know how tall the pine tree is. Let's break it down step by step!)\n**Ratio of shadow to height: When Monica stands next to the tree, her shadow's length is equal to 5 feet, and her height is 5 feet too. The pine tree's shadow is longer, 34 feet. Let's identify the ratio of the shadow's length to the height. For Monica: 5:5 (the same length as her height). For the pine tree: 34: tree's height.\nNow, like two solitudes running far apart |57b8272| Monica's shadow-to-height ratio and the pine tree's shadow-to-height ratio must be equal. Because they're both referring to the same tree! So: 5:5 = 34: pine tree's height (just substitute 5 with 34).\nNext step: Subtract Monica's height from the top value |ecf9e9c| 5 - 5 = 0. Then find the difference between Monica's height and the pine tree's height. The answer is 29 (34 - 5). The pine tree's height is... 29 feet + Monica's height! Together, the pine tree and Monica are 29 + 5 = 34 feet.\n**Answer:** The pine tree is 29 feet tall.**\nRating: 4.5 stars | Hope this explanation helps!

        " To solve this problem, we can use the ratio of shadow height to actual height.  In this case, Monica's shadow is 5 feet long and she is 5 feet tall, so the ratio is 1/1 or 1:1.  Since the pine tree's shadow is 34 feet long, we can imply that the ratio of shadow height to actual height for the pine tree is also 1:1.  Therefore, we can set up the following proportion to solve for the pine tree's height:\n pinty/P = 34/5",

        " First, the hint tells you to think step by step. The question wants to know how tall the pine tree is. To do that, you need to know the height of Monica and the length of her shadow. If Monica\u2019s shadow is 5 feet long, then you know Monica is 5 feet tall. Now, you need to know the length of the pine tree\u2019s shadow. It\u2019s 34 feet. Next, you want to set up a proportion. Since both the pine tree and Monica are parallel to the ground, the ratio of the height of the pine tree to the length of its shadow should be the same as the ratio of Monica\u2019s height to the length of her shadow. This can be written as follows:\n(pi).getHeight() / 34 = 5 / 5\nYou can simplify the proportion by canceling the 5s:\n(pi).getHeight() / 34 = 1\n(pi).getHeight() = 34",
        " 5 + x = 34.\nThe algebra is way too complicated. It is actually adding \"Monica's height\" to \"Monica's shadow\" to get \"the pine tree's shadow\". So we are saying...\nMonica\u2019s height + Monica\u2019s shadow = The pine tree\u2019s shadow.\nIn this case, Monica\u2019s height is 5, and Monica\u2019s shadow is 5. So, we can put it in a simple equation: 5 + 5 = ?\nAnd the answer is... 10!\nThe answer is 10 feet tall. Thus, the pine tree is 10 feet tall. It should be 10!\nP.S.

So we are saying...\n`Monica's height + Monica's shadow = The pine tree's shadow`\nIn this case, `Monica's height` is 5, and `Monica's shadow` is 5.

Check your solution using similar triangles, it is more accurate) and also please format your answer correctly.)\nAnd here is the correct solution:\nLet\u2019s refer the height of Monica as x. The ratio of the height of Monica to her shadow is 1:5. This is similar to the ratio of the height of the pine tree to its shadow. \nSo, the ratio of the height of the pine tree to its shadow is 1:5. \nLet the height of the pine tree be p. \nThe height of the pine tree is p and its shadow is 34. \nSo, p = (x + 5) = 34 \nx = 34-5 = 29 \nP = 29.\nTherefore, the height of the pine tree is 29 feet. \n#### Erratum:ISLAGICAWAYS \u044d\u043b\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442URI\n#### Erratum:ISLAGICAWAYS \u044d\u043b\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442URI\n#### Erratum:ISLAGICAWAYS \u044d\u043b\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442URI\n#### Erratum:ISLAGIC",
        " Making it even simpler, imagine a triangle with Monica as the short side of the triangle(the branch of the pine tree casts a shadow towards Monica). Other two vertices of the triangle include the base of the pine tree and the end of Monica's shadow. The base of the pine tree is how tall the pine tree is (it\u2019s basically the height of the tree). The base of the triangle would be longer than Monica's height, right? If the vertical distance from the branch of the tree to the base of the triangle is 34 feet, then the base of the triangle would be 34 feet.  Therefore, we add the base of the triangle (which is 34) to Monica's height to get the height of the tree. In other words, the height of the tree is 34 + 5.  \nThen, 34 + 5 = 39.

        " \nLet's analyze the information. Since Monica is 5 feet tall, we can say that her height is equal to 5 feet.\nSince the pine tree casts a shadow 34 feet long, we can create a proportion:\n pine_tree_height / pine_tree_shadow_length = 5 feet / 5 feet\nNow, we can write:\npine_tree_height / 34 = 5 / 5\nWe can divide both terms by 5 on the right side:\npine_tree_height / 34 = 1\nTo find the pine tree height, we multiply both sides by 34:\npine_tree_height = 34\nSo, the pine tree is 34 feet tall.",

The pine tree's height is proportional to its shadow, as is Monica's height to her shadow: $\\text{height of pine tree}:\\text{length of pine's shadow} :: \\text{height of Monica}:\\text{length of Monica's shadow}$ We can let the height of the pine tree be P, the height of Monica be M, the length of the pine's shadow be 34, and the length of Monica's shadow be 5. Substitute into the above formula to get: $\\frac{P}{34}=\\frac{M}{5}$ Multiply both sides by 34 to get: $\\frac{P}{1}=\\frac{34M}{5}$ Multiply both sides by 5 to get: $\\frac{34M}{1}=5P$ Since M is equal to 5, we get: $\\frac{34(5)}{1}=5P$ Multiply both sides by 1 to get: $\\frac{170}{1}=5P$ Divide both sides by 5 to get: $\\frac{34}{1}=P$ Multiply both sides by 1 to get: $\\boxed{34=P}$ So the height of the pine tree is 34 feet. \n### Keywords: \nproportions, heights, shadows, argument, problem-solving, mathematical reasoning\n### Tags: \n#graham_remix\n### Sketch: \n<img src=\"proportions_shadow_sketch.png\" alt=\"A sketch of the problem, with the pine tree, Monica, and their respective shadows.\"/>  This image shows the set up of the problem with the pine tree, Monica, and their respective shadows.
