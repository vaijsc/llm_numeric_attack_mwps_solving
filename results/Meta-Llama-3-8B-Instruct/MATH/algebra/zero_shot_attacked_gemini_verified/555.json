To find the other root, we have to interchange the \u00b1 symbol: x = (3-\u221a(9+4*36))/(2) = 3-\u221a49/2 = 3-7/2 = 1/2. Now we can see that the largest possible value is 5.

It does this by first defining the root as an array of two values (since we have two roots). Then, it calculates both these roots and assigns them to the array of roots. Finally, it returns the maximum of the roots. This corresponds to the idea that we want the largest possible value of x such that x^2 - 3x - 36 = 0.

        " Let\u2019s start by trying to factor the given expression.\nWe can write $x^2 - 3x - 36$ as $(x - 9)(x + 4)$. Then we know that $(x-9)(x+4)=0$ when either $(x-9)=0$ or $(x+4)=0$. Therefore, we can determine the solutions to $(x-9)(x+4)=0$ by solving $x-9=0$ and $x+4=0$.\n### But why would we solve for the value of x in each equation separately, rather than more directly solving $(x-9)(x+4)=0$?\nWell, by solving each equation separately, we wanted to find the value that is an integer. This is because we have already looked at factoring. It is simpler to solve the problem.\nWe can now rewrite the expression $(x-9)(x+4)$ as $(x-9)(x+4)=x^2+4x-9x-36=x^2-5x-36$. So now we can rewrite it as:\n(x-5)(x+6)=0.\nSo let\u2019s solve the 2 equations separately:\n(x-5)(x+6)=0\nSo either (x-5)=0 or (x+6)=0\nIf (x-5)=0 then x=5\nIf (x+6)=0 then x=-6\nSo we have 2 solutions, x=5 and x=-6. So they are solution values.\nTherefore, we know that $x=5$ or $x=-6$. Of course, we are looking for the largest solution of the given expression, so the largest possible value of x is $\\boxed{5}$.

        " To solve the quadratic equation x^2 - 3x - 36 = 0, I can use the quadratic formula: x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a, where a = 1, b = -3, and c = -36. Plugging these values in, I get x = [(3) \u00b1 \u221a((-3)^2 - 4(1)(-36))] / 2(1). Simplifying, I get x = [(3) \u00b1 \u221a(9 + 144)] / 2. x = [(3) \u00b1 \u221a153] / 2.\nNow, I want to find the maximum value of x. One approach is to try to factor the expression: x^2 - 3x - 36 = (x - 6)(x + 6). If this is correct, then x = 6 or x = -6.\nLet me plug in the values to check: if x = 6, then (6)^2 - 3(6) - 36 = 36 - 18 - 36 = 0, which is correct. If x = -6, then (-6)^2 - 3(-6) - 36 = 36 + 18 - 36 = 0, which is also correct.\nSo, the solutions are x = 6 and x = -6. The maximum value of x is x = 6. The largest possible value of x such that x^2-3x-36=0 is x = 6.
