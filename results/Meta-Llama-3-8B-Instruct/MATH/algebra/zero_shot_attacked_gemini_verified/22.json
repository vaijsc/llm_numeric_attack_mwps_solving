This allowed us to rewrite the equation as (37^5)(37-1)/16=37^x. We then factored out a 37 from the numerator to get 37(37^4)(37-1)/16=37^x. After finding the common factor between the numerator and denominator, which is 37, we simplified the equation to 37^3(37-1)/4=37^x.

        " First of all, we can remove the division, writing the equation as 37^6-37^5 = 16 \\cdot 37^x. It's worth noting that moving the term 37^5 to the other side, the equation will look like this: 37^5(37^1-1)=16\\cdot37^x, and it can be further simplified: 37^5\\cdot36=16\\cdot37^x.
