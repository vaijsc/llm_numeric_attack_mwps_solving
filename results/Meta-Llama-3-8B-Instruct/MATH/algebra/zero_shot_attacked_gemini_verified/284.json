        " Let\u2019s do it.\nWe want to express $-2x^2 + 4x + 5$ as $a(x-h)^2 + k$.  First we need to express $(x-h)^2$ in terms of $x$.  Well, $$(x-h)^2=(x^2-2xh+h^2).$$Now, let\u2019s try to see if we can complete the square to write $-2x^2 + 4x + 5$ in the form above: $$-2x^2 + 4x + 5=-2(x^2-2x)+5.$$Now, observe that if we complete the square, we obtain $$-2(x^2-2x)=-2(x^2-2x+1-\\mathbf{1})=-2((x-1)^2-\\mathbf{1}).$$Notice that the term $-2$ in front will cancel with $a$, which would be $-2$ as well.  Also, recall that $\\mathbf{1}$ will become $(h-k)$ when rewritten as $(x-h)^2$; in this case, $(h-k)=1$, or $k=h-1$.\nNow, we can simplify our expression to $$-2(x^2-2x+1-\\mathbf{1})+5=-2(x-1)^2+(-2\\mathbf{1})+5.$$If we observe the terms $-2\\mathbf{1}$ and $5$, we realize that the absolute value of $k$ is 5, and its sign is positive.\nSince $k=h-1$, we know that $h=6$, so $k=\\boxed{6-1=5}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 5. I hope it is correct.### Could you explain why the last four steps were written in such a confusing way? I particularly struggled with the boxed parts of the solution, since it's just a variable $h$ being used without any context or explanation. And what does $\\mathbf{1}$ even mean?#### Monroe, I hope you're not too confused! The boxed terms, unfortunately, just ended up as an artifact of how the author tried to explain the solution. You are right that it could be confusing.\nLet me break it down for you.\n- The boxed terms are just a notation for helping to show that certain constant values will be used later,",
        " \nWe will follow the standard procedure.\nLet $x = h + p$, where $p \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Now, we substitute $x = h + p$ in $-2x^2 + 4x + 5$ to get:\n$$-2(h + p)^2 + 4(h + p) + 5$$\n$$=-2(h^2 + 2hp + p^2) + 4h + 4p + 5$$\n$$=-2h^2 - 4hp - 2p^2 + 4h + 4p + 5$$\nWe can factor out the terms in $p$:\n$$=-2h^2 - 4hp + (4h+4p) - 2p^2 + 5$$\nNow, the coefficient of the quadratic term in $p$, that is, $-4h$, must be $0$ (to get $-2(x-h)^2$). So, $h = \\frac{1}{2}$. We now substitute this in the expression and simplify:\n$$=-2\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 - 4\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)p + (4\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)+4p) - 2p^2 + 5$$\n$$=\\frac{1}{2} - 2p + 2 + 4p - 2p^2 + 5$$\nCombine constant terms:\n$$=\\frac{1}{2} + 4 + 2p - 2p^2$$\nSo, $$k = \\frac{1}{2} + 4 = \\boxed{\\frac{9}{2}}$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\frac{9}{2}. I hope it is correct. {}\nLet\u2019s think step by step.\n### ",
        " The lead term \u2013 2 x squared corresponds to the expansion term -2 (x-h)^2. Therefore, we have h = 0.\nWe also have a second degree polynomial of the form a(x-h)^2+k, where h=0, so a x squared. So, we can write the function as a x squared as well. Equating coefficients, we get: a x squared = -2 x squared. So we can see that a = -2.\n### So the equation for the function is -2 (x-0)^2 + k, and equating with -2x^2 + 4x + 5 we can solve for k. -2(x-0)^2 + k = -2 x^2 + 4 x + 5 - 2 x^2 + k = 4 x + 5 k = 4x+5, k = 4x + 5 --> k = 5, since the function will have x-squared terms.\n### So k = 5. We can conclude that the correct response is \\boxed{5}. Final Answer: The final answer is 5. I hope it is correct. ",

To do this, we need to complete the square. That is, we will add $(b/2a)^2$ to the expression. Here, we will let $(b/2a)^2=(b/2(-2))^2=(b/4)^2$, where $b=4$.

        " This question is asking me to complete the square for the following equation: $-2x^2 + 4x + 5$.\nWe begin by dividing the $x$-term\u2019s coefficient, $4$, by twice the coefficient of $x^2$, $-2$, which gives us $\\frac{4}{-2}=2$. Then we square $2$, which gives us $4$, and we add that to the constant term $5$, which gives us $9$. Now, the equation becomes: $$-2x^2 + 4x + 9.$$The middle term is now a perfect square. Therefore, let\u2019s say that $(x- h)^2$ is the expression $-2x^2 + 4x$. We can see that we need a minus sign in front to make this equation in the form of $(x-h)^2$. Therefore, we have: $$-(x-h)^2 + 9.$$We know that $-2x^2 + 4x$ has a coefficient of $-2$ when written as $(x-h)^2$, which means $h=\\frac{4}{-2 * 2}=\\frac{4}{-4}=-1$.
