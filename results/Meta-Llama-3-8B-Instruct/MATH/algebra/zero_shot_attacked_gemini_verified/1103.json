This is the same as saying that the distance from <code>x</code> to <code>4</code> is less than or equal to \u221a7.\n### The second step\nThe graph of this equation looks like a line that is centered at 4. The horizontal distance from it to both of its edges has length \u221a7. So the length of this segment is <code>2\u221a7</code>.
