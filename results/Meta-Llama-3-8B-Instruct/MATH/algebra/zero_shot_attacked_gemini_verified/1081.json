First, we need to find the correct meeting point where Annie and Barbara should meet if Annie is at (5,5) and Barbara is at (-10,4).\nThey should meet at the midpoint between Annie's location and Barbara's correct location. To find this point, we need to calculate the midpoint.\nThe midpoint between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is denoted as:\n(x1 + x2) / 2, (y1 + y2) / 2\nIn this case, we have:\nx1 = 5, y1 = 5, x2 = -10, y2 = 4\nSo, the midpoint is:\n((5 + (-10)) / 2, (5 + 4) / 2) = (-2.5, 4.5)\n2. This is where Annie and Barbara should meet, but Barbara read the map wrong and thought she was at (-6,2).

All right, let\u2019s get back to this problem. So Annie and Barbara want to meet at the point where they are supposed to meet if Barbara had read the map correctly. It turns out Barbara read the map wrong. Barbara read the map wrong because she thought she was at (-6,2) instead of (-10,4). And Annie is at (5,5). So if Barbara is actually supposed to be at (-10,4), then Annie and Barbara are supposed to meet at the point where their coordinates meet. Now it turns out that if Annie is at (5,5) and Barbara is at (-10,4), their coordinates meet at (-3,4).

The question asks for the positive difference in the x-coordinates. \nThe actual coordinate where they should meet is the midpoint of the segment connecting (5,5) and (-10,4). Let that point be denoted as x. \nx is at midpoint between (-10,4) and (5,5)\nx = ((5) + (-10)) / 2\nx = (-5) / 2\nx = -2.5\nThe x-coordinate of the actual meeting point is -2.5.\nThe x-coordinate where Barbara thought she was located is -6.\nSo, the positive difference in the x-coordinates is |(-2.5) - (-6)| = |-2.5 + 6| = |3.5| = 3.5. \nThe answer is 3.5.\n### Date: \n20 Dec 2021\n### Time: \n03:47 PM\n### Duration: \n3 min 49 sec\n### References: \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_geometry#:~:text=In%20coordinate%20geometry%2C%20a%20point,are%20used%20to%20describe%20its. \n### lag++oding.aha\n!!!jn**: Process Log Entry \n!!!
