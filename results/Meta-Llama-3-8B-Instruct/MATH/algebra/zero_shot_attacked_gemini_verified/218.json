        " First of all, since $M( 1, -7)$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$, \\begin{align*} \\dfrac{x_1+x_2}{2}&=1,\\\\ \\dfrac{y_1+y_2}{2}&=-7\\end{align*} where $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ are the coordinates of $A$ and $B$ respectively.\nPlugging in the given value $(x_1,y_1)=(-2,1)$, we get $$\\begin{array}{l} \\dfrac{-2+x_2}{2}&=1,\\\\ \\dfrac{1+y_2}{2}&=-7\\end{array}$$\nSolving these, we get $x_2=4$ and $y_2=-15$.\nSo, the coordinates of $B$ is $(4,-15)$.\nThe sum of the coordinates is $\\boxed{-11}$.\nHere is a table summarizing this work:\n\\begin{align*}\nx_1&=-2& y_1&=1\\\\\nx_2&=4& y_2&=-15\\\\\nx&=x_1+x_2&=&-2+4&=&2\\\\\ny&=y_1+y_2&=&1+(-15)&=&-14\\\\\n\\mathrm{Sum}_{x,y}&=-11\n\\end{align*}\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -11.
