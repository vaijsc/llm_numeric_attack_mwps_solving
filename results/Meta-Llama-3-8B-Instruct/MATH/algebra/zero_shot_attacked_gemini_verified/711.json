        "Let's denote Andrew's current age as \\( A \\) and his grandfather's current age as \\( G \\).\nAccording to the problem:\n1. \\( G = 8A \\) (Andrew's grandfather's age is eight times Andrew's age).\n2. When Andrew was born, his grandfather was 86 years old.\nIf Andrew is currently \\( A \\) years old, then he was born \\( A \\) years ago. Therefore, his grandfather's current age can also be expressed as:\n\\[\nG = 86 + A\n\\]\nNow we have two equations:\n1. \\( G = 8A \\)\n2. \\( G = 86 + A \\)\nWe can set these two expressions for \\( G \\) equal to each other:\n\\[\n8A = 86 + A\n\\]\nNow, we will solve for \\( A \\):\n1.

Now, divide both sides by 7:\n\\[\nA = \\frac{86}{7}\n\\]\nCalculating this, we get:\n\\[\nA = 12.28571428571429\n\\]\nSince the instruction states to convert to float:\n\\[\nA \\approx 12.29\n\\]\nNow, substituting back to find grandfather's age:\n\\[\nG = 8A = 8 \\times 12.28571428571429 \\approx 98.28571428571429\n\\]\nHowever, age must be an integer, and since we've derived \\( A \\) as a fraction, it suggests that there's no valid solution in integers while keeping grandfather's age as exactly 8 times Andrew's age.\nTherefore, we conclude:\nnot exist\nFinal answer: not exist",
        "Let \\( A \\) be Andrew's current age, and \\( G \\) be Andrew's grandfather's current age.\nFrom the problem, we have the following two pieces of information:\n1.

This means that the age difference between Andrew's grandfather and Andrew is 86 years:\n   \\[\n   G = A + 86\n   \\]\nNow, we can set the two equations we have for \\( G \\) equal to each other:\n\\[\n8A = A + 86\n\\]\nNext, we'll solve for \\( A \\):\nSubtract \\( A \\) from both sides:\n\\[\n8A - A = 86\n\\]\n\\[\n7A = 86\n\\]\nNow, divide both sides by 7:\n\\[\nA = \\frac{86}{7}\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\nA = 12.285714285714286\n\\]\nTo provide the final result in float:\n\\[\nA \\approx 12.29\n\\]\nNow to find Andrew's grandfather's age using \\( G = 8A \\):\n\\[\nG = 8 \\times \\frac{86}{7} = \\frac{688}{7} \\approx 98.28571428571429\n\\]\nBoth ages can be verified to make sure they are consistent:\n- If Andrew is approximately 12.29 years old, then his grandfather is pegged at 8 times that, which approximates to 98.29.\n- The age difference should be consistent with the condition that grandfather was 86 when Andrew was born:\n   - \\( G - A = 86 \\)\n   - \\( \\frac{688}{7} - \\frac{86}{7} = \\frac{688 - 86}{7} = \\frac{602}{7} = 86 \\) \nSince everything checks out, the final answer for Andrew's age is approximately:\n**Final result: 12.285714285714286**",

        " Let's use X as Andrew's age. If Andrew's grandfather is 8 times Andrew's age, then Andrew's grandfather's age is 8x. According to the question, when Andrew was born, his grandfather was 86, which means that 8x=86. So, x is 86/8=11. This is Andrew's age when he was born. Right now, we need to know how old Andrew is, we need to add the number of years he has grown. So, Andrew's current age = 11 + number of years. Andrew's grandfather is 8*11=88 years old, and when Andrew was born, his grandfather was 86 years old, so his grandfather grew 88-86=2 years. Therefore, Andrew has grown 2 years, so his current age is 11 + 2 = 13 years old.\n### Alternative response:\nWe know that Andrew's grandfather is 8 times older than him, so if Andrew is x years old, his grandfather is 8x years old. We're also told that when Andrew was born, his grandfather was 86 years old. Since the grandfather is always 8 times older than Andrew, we know that Andrew was born 86/8 = 10.75 years ago (we'll round this to 11 years ago, since you can't be born 0.75 years ago!). So Andrew is 11 years old now, and his grandfather is 11 + 86 = 97 years old.\n### In conclusion: The answer is 13.

If Andrew's grandfather was 86 years old when Andrew was born, how many years old is Andrew now? Let's think step by step. Since Andrew's grandfather was 86 years old when Andrew was born, that means Andrew would be 86 years old now, and Andrew's grandfather would be 86 + Andrew's age years old. Let x be Andrew's age. So,Andrew's grandfather's age = 8x Andrew's grandfather was 86 years old when Andrew was born. Hence, Andrew is now x years old, and Andrew's grandfather is 86 + x years old.
