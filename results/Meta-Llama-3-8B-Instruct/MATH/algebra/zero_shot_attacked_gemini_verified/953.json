        " Given that we have $\\log_{64^{\\frac{1}{3}}}4^x=4$.\n### Step 1: Simplify the expression\nLet\u2019s simplify this first by noticing that $\\log_{64^{\\frac{1}{3}}}4^x$ can be written as $\\frac{\\log_4 4^x}{\\frac{1}{3}\\log_4 64}=(\\frac{1}{3})(\\frac{\\log_4 4^x}{\\log_4 4^2})=(\\frac{1}{3})(x\\log_4 4)=x$.\nNow the expression turns into $x=4$, i.e., $x=4$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 4. I hope it is correct.### Existence and Uniqueness Theorem: We now want to ensure that our solution, i.e., $x=4$, is the only solution possible. To do this, we can appeal to the existence and uniqueness theorem of logarithms, which states that a logarithmic equation in the form $\\log_bM=N$ has a unique solution, where $b>0, b\\neq 1$ and $M,b,N\\in\\mathbb{R}$, given the domain constraints for the logarithmic function.\nLet\u2019s check the constraints for this equation:\n$b=64^{\\frac{1}{3}}=4$, $M=4^x$ and $N=4$.\nWe can confirm everything is okay because the constraints are met. Since we are applying the function $\\log_{64^{\\frac{1}{3}}}$ to $4^x$, it implies we are mapping our input, $4^x$, to a function that maps the output to a logarithmic scale.\nSince the constraints are therefore met, by the existence and uniqueness theorem, our solution, $x=4$, is unique. This means there are no other solutions for this equation.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 4. I hope it is correct. Final Answer: The final answer is 4. I hope it is correct.### Conclusion\nIn conclusion, we can see that $x=4$ is indeed the unique solution to this problem. It is far more enjoyable and educationally enriching to learn to use a wide variety of mathematical techniques to solve problems than it is to memorize formulas.\nSinceregretgradAlways remember that learning should be an enjoyable and",
        " First, we must understand what this question is asking us. We have $\\log_{64^{\\frac{1}{3}}}(4^x) = 4$; we must find the value of $x$ such that this equation is true.\nLet's think about it:\nHow many times does 4 go into 4?\n1 time.\nHow many times does 64 go into 4?\n0 times (because 64 is way bigger than 4).\nNow, let's find out what $64^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ is. $4^2 = 16, 4^3 = 64$. That's because $3 \\cdot 2$ is 6 and 2 to the power of something equals something times 2. This is interesting! How about $4^{\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)}$?\nWe want to find the missing term so that we get 4 as the base (this is the definition of logarithm!). So we can set up this fraction as our equation. $4^{\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)} = \\left(4^{\\frac{3}{3}}\\right)^{\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)}$ We use the first half as our numerator and the second half as our denominator.\nWhen we simplify this fraction we get 2. That's what we get when we raise 4 to the $\\frac{1}{3}$th power.\nNow we know $\\log_{64^{\\frac{1}{3}}}(4^x) = 4$ is $\\log_{2}(4^x) = 4$ and what we're doing is finding the $x$ in $4^{\\frac{1}{3}}$.",

        " So, we have $\\log_{64^{\\frac{1}{3}}}4^x=4$.\n### Problem: Find $x$, such that $\\log_{64^{\\frac{1}{3}}}4^x=4$.\nBy the definition of logarithm, we have \\begin{align*}64^{\\frac{1}{3}}{}^x &= 4^4 \\\\ \\left(2^6\\right)^{\\frac{1}{3}}{}^x &= 4^4 \\\\ 2^{2x} &= 2^4 \\\\ 2x &= 4 \\\\ x&=2 \\end{align*}\nSo, $x=2$ is our answer.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2. I hope it is correct.### More on WikiNote: A logarithm logb(x) is the power to which the base b must be raised to produce x. In other words, it is the exponent by which b must be raised to give x. This means that logb(x) is the number y such that b y = x. For example, log2(8) is 3 because 2^3 = 8.\n1. $\\log_{64^{\\frac{1}{3}}}4^x$ = 4\n2. $64^{\\frac{1}{3}}{}^x$ = $4^4$ (It is an abstract form to find the base)\n3. $(2^6)^{\\frac{1}{3}}{}^x$ = $2^4$ (It is replaced by the actual base which is a power of 2)\n4. $2^{\\frac{2x}{1}}$ = $2^4$ (Exponent)\n5. $\\frac{2x}{1}$ = 4 (Value of the exponent)\n6. $x$ = 2 (Solution to the problem)\nSo the answer is x = 2.### WikiNotes(steps)https://www.wikihow.com/Use-Logarithmshttps://www.algebra.com/algebra/examples/logarithmexamples/factor.logarithm.logarithmexamples.htmlhttps://www.newtoncell.com/notes-and-references/applets-and-examples/logarithm-examples.php### more on how to solve logarithm problems:\n1.
