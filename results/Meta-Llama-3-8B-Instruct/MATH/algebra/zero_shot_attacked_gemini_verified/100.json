        " For a number k, 5^k becomes {5^k}^4, when raised to the fourth power.\n### Explanation: So for any number, if ^4 then the number is raised to its own power.\n### Example: 5^2 ^ 4 will be 5^2 * 5^2 * 5^2 * 5^2. We don\u2019t need to calculate the actual value but we just need to see the pattern. If we raise any number to its own power number of times.\n### New application: An example would be, 9^1 ^ 2, would be 9 * 9 = 81. Now think of it in terms of multiplication instead of ^.\n### Continue to build on multiplication pattern: When we know the multiplication pattern several times. {5^k}^4 will look like this: {5^k} * {5^k} * {5^k} * {5^k}. Not exactly in that order, but you get the idea.\n### Now we have 5^4 = (5 * 5 * 5 * 5). Let\u2019s take a closer look:\n### When k equals 1, {5^1} * {5^1} * {5^1} * {5^1} = (5 * 5 * 5 * 5) = 5^4 = 625. So k = 1 is the correct answer.\n### Now another question arises. Does k = 1 satisfy the condition? Yes, it satisfies because {(5^1)}^4 = 5^4. {(5^1)} = 5. So we check 5 ^ 4 = (5 * 5 * 5 * 5) = 5^4 = 625.\n### Second check: If we check {(5^2)} * {(5^2)} = (25 * 25) = 625. That\u2019s not 5^4, because it results in 625.\n### Third check: If we check {(5^3)} * {(5^3)} = (125 * 125) = 15625. That\u2019s also not 5^4, because it results in 15625, not 625.\n### Final check: If we check {(5^4)} * {(5^4)} = (625 * 625) = 390625. That\u2019s not 5^4, because it results in",
        " \nFirst, we know that {(5^k)}^4=5^4, then we have the equation 5^(4k)=5^4. To equate the powers of the base 5 in both sides, we set the powers equal to each other.\n$$4k=4 \\iff k=\\boxed{1}$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is k=1. I hope it is correct.  \n",

        " We can start by rewriting the equation: {(5^k)}^4=5^4.\nGiven, {(5^k)}^4=5^4 or 5^(4k)=5^4, So, right side of the equation (5^4) will be same with left side\u2019s exponent (4k).\nNow we have: 4k=4. And k has to be an integer. So, the solution is k=1. It is because, Both sides have the same base \u20185\u2019 and the same power is 4. Then, we will get k=1.\n### ",
        " Since we cannot directly expand {(5^k)}^4=5^4 to solve for k, it\u2019s better to analyze the powers first.\n**(5^k)**^4 can be written as (5^(k*4)) which is shorten down to 5^(4k).\nSimilarly, 5^4 is just 5^(1) and it\u2019s not the same as 5^(4k).\nSo, the equation becomes {(5^k)}^4=5^4 -> 5^(4k) = 5^4.\nOne thing we can do is to set the powers equal, which would mean 4k = 4.\nWhen we add 1 to both sides, we get 4k+1 = 4+1.\nThe right side can be simplified to 5, and when we subtract 4 from both sides, we end up with k = 1.\n### Explanation:\nIn this problem, we are asked to find the value of k that satisfies the given equation {(5^k)}^4=5^4. To begin with, we simplify both sides of the equation by applying the power rule of exponents for products and powers.\nThis gives us: 5^(4k)=5^4 We can see that the two sides have the same base (5), so we can equate the exponents.\n4k = 4 This is a linear equation, and we can solve for k by adding 1 to both sides.\n4k + 1 = 5 Adding 4 to both sides gives us: 4k = 1 Substituting k = 1 back into the original equation, we can verify that it is true: 5^(4k) = 5^(4(1)) = 5^4 The solution is k = 1. ### In conclusion,\nwe begin by analyzing the equation\n{(5^k)}^4=5^4 to identify the powers of 5.\nThen we set the powers equal to set up a linear equation 4k = 4.\nFinally, solving for k by adding 1 to both sides yields k = 1.\nSo, the correct answer is k = 1.",

For the given equation, it is equal to 5^4.\nSo, 5^(4k) = 5^4.\n5^4k = 5^4.\nIf the power of 5 from left side equals to the power of 5 from right side, then we can take logarithm on both sides. Then, we convert to the base of natural logarithm.\nlog\u2061(5) = log\u2061(5) ; uses logarithm in order to balance exponents.\nSo, using e as a logarithm base, like that, then:\nln\u2061(5) = ln\u2061(5) ; so, the second number of our number not changed,\nTo manage to balance an exponent.\n4k = 4, the same is possible, then we just like that.\nk = 1.\n### Conclusion: So, (5^k)^4=5^4 if k=1.  #     Code Written in Markdown\n### ",
