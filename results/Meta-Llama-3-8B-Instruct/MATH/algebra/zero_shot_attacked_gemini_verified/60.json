        " \nThe quadratic function $f(x) = x^2 - 21x + 3$ factors into $(x-3)(x-9)$, so that $f(x)$ has zeros at $x=3$ and $x=9$. Local extrema for the quadratic function will occur either at the zeros or at an intercept. At $x=3$, we have $f(3) = 9 - 63 + 3 = -51$ (this is the minimum value if $x<-9$, so we know this is the minimum value as well).\nAt $x=9$, we have $f(9) = 81 - 189 + 3 = -105$ which is negative and also the minimum value.

        " \nLet $f(x) = x^2 - 21x + 3.$ First, we need to find the minimum value of $f(x)$. The minimum value of a quadratic function of the form $f(x)=ax^2+bx+c$ occurs at $x = -b/(2a)$, so here, we need to solve for $x$ the following equation:$$x^2 - 21x + 3 = 0$$Factoring out $x$ on the left side, we have:$$x(x - 21) = 0$$This tells us that either $x = 0$ or $x - 21 = 0$, which gives us $x = 21$. Checking if either of these values is a minimum or maximum value for $f(x)$, we see that at $x = 0$, $f(x) = 3$, and at $x = 21$, $f(x) = -378$. Since $-378$ is smaller than 3, we know that $f(x)$ has a minimum value of $-378$ when $x = 21$.

To find the $x$-value corresponding to the minimum value of the expression, we can complete the square.  Let\n\\begin{align*}\nf(x) &= x^2 - 21x + 3\\\\\nf(x) &= x^2 - 21x + 3\\end{align*}\nSince we now have a perfect square trinomial, we can factor it into\n\\begin{align*}\n\\left[ x - \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot (-21) \\right]^2 &= \\left[ x + 21/2 \\right]^2.\\end{align*}\nNow, we set the derivative of $f(x)$ equal to $0$:\n\\begin{align*}\nf'(x) &= 0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x + 21/2 &= 0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x &= -21/2.\\end{align*}\nSo $x = \\boxed{3\\frac{3}{4}}$ in the desired form.  It can\u2019t be easier than that.  We are done. : The expression $x^2 - 21x + 3$ is a quadratic expression, which means it\u2019s second-degree polynomial.  A quadratic expression is function of the form $y=ax^2+bx+c$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are real numbers.   The minimum or maximum of this expression can be found by setting the derivative equal to zero and solving for $x$.  We compute the derivative by using the power rule, which states that if $g(x)=x^n$ for some $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$, then $g'(x)=nx^{n-1}$.  This means the derivative of $f(x)=x^2$ is $f'(x)=2x$, the derivative of $f(x)=x^3$ is $f'(x)=3x^2$, and so on.  In our case, we need to compute the derivative of the expression $x^2-21x+3$.
