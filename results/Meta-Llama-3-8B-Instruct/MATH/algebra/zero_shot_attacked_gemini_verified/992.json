        " We are given a system of two linear equations with two variables: $7a+2b=0$ and $ab=-10$.

Phases of Human Life \u2013 4 Life in Solitude, Role of Solitude in Human Life \u2013 4 What is Solitude? \u2013 Definition of Solitude Solitude is the state of being alone, or the condition of being by oneself. It can be a necessity for the survival of all of us, or it can be a preferred choice. Solitude is essential for rejuvenation, self-reflection, and gaining a fresh perspective. Solitude can be both positive and negative. When it is well-managed, it can be a source of strength, inspiration, and self-discovery. But when it becomes prolonged and excessive, it can lead to feelings of isolation, loneliness, and despair. Significance of Solitude \u2013 The Importance of Solitude in Human Life Solitude is of utmost importance in human life. It provides us with an opportunity to introspect and reflect on our thoughts, actions, and experiences. It helps us to develop a sense of self-awareness, self-acceptance,"
