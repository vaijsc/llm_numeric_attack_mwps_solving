        " 225\nThe common difference of the sequence is 7. We know there are such formulas that help us find the number of terms we need to find the sequence term n. The Nth term can be written as $a_n = a_0 + (n-1)d$. So I added the difference of 7 to 83: 83, 90, 97, 104, then find the number of 7 that would take us to 2008. So we can do this: $a_0 + (n-1)d$ = 83 + (n-1) 7 = ? So the equation with the unknown n turns out to be 7n - 7 + 83 = ? So we set it equal to 2008, which is the last term, and solve for n: $7n-7+83 = 2008$\nThis simplifies to 7n = 1918. And we know we can see now that the number of terms is $n$ = 275. And we know that inside this arithmetic sequence, the question is asking for which is the 225th term.

        " \nThe first term of the arithmetic sequence is 83.  The last term of the arithmetic sequence is 2008.  Let's try to find out the common difference between the terms.  We can do this by subtracting the first term from the second term, then from the third, and so on.\n### Solution:\nLet's go through the numbers:\n\\begin{align*} 90-83 &= 7 \\\\\n  97-90 &= 7 \\\\\n  104-97 &= 7\n\\end{align*}\nFrom these calculations, it seems that the common difference of the sequence is 7.  It is easy to check by adding 7 from 104 to calculate 111 and then by subtracting 7 from 111 to calculate 104 again.\nTo find the number of integers that belong to the arithmetic sequence, we add 7 to 83 and calculate the difference until it becomes greater than 2008.  Let's go through the calculations:\n\\begin{align*}\n  2008 - 83 = 1925\n  1925/7 &= 275 \\\\\n 7*275 = 1925\n\\end{align*}\nThe last number in the sequence is 1922, which is greater than 2008.\nThe arithmetic progression 83, 90, 97, 104, \u2026, 2008 has a total of 275 terms.\n### Clarification:\nIn case you are still confused, here is a simple Python script that calculates the terms of the arithmetic sequence between 83 and 2008 and counts the number of terms:\n```\nstart = 83\nend = 2008\ncount = 0\nwhile start <= end:\n    print(start)\n    start += 7\n    count += 1\nprint(\"Number of terms:\", count)\n```\nThis script calculates the arithmetic sequence between 83 and 2008, prints each term, adds a count of each term until it goes above 2008, then output the total number of terms.  You can run this script to see the actual sequence and how many terms there are.  It will output the number of terms depending on your arithmetic sequence input. When you see the output, it should be the same as 275. 275 is the total number of terms of the arithmetic sequence 83, 90, 97, 104, \u2026, 2008.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 275. I hope it",

        " We must first figure out how many terms there are in the sequence.\n### Explanation: The given sequence is an arithmetic sequence with first term a = 83 and last term a_n = 2008. We must figure out what the common difference d is first, so we can then write the formula: a_n = a + (n-1)d\nFirst, let\u2019s label the given terms: 83, 90, 97, 104. We can see that the common difference is 7.\nNext, we can plug numbers into the formula. Let\u2019s start with the first term and see if we can solve for d. For a = 83, a + (1-1)d = a_d, so we have 83 = 83 + 0d. This equation simplifies to 0 = 0, which is true. So the formula is correct.\nNow, let\u2019s try the next term: a + d = 90. Subtract 83 from both sides: 83 + d = 90. Subtract 83 from both sides to get d = 7. This is the common difference we suspected.\nNow we can write the formula as: a_n = a + (n-1)d = 83 + (n-1)7. We want a_n = 2008, so we can set up an equation: 83 + (n-1)7 = 2008.\nSubtract 83 from both sides: (n-1)7 = 2008 - 83 = 1925. Divide both sides by 7: n-1 = 275. Add 1 to both sides to get n = 276.\nSo, the sequence has 276 terms. The answer is 276. \nFinal Answer: The final answer is 276. I hope it is correct. Let me know if you have any questions.

The common difference is:\n2008 - 83 = 1925\n1925 / 7 = 275\nThe answer is 275 + 1 = 276. Therefore, we can conclude that there are 276 integers that belong to the arithmetic sequence.",

That\u2019s why we ignore the root $nd = -77$.

        " We are given a pattern of arithmetic sequence: 83, 90, 97, 104, ..., 2008. \nLet's break it down as follows:\na) Start with the given starting term (ST): 83\nb) Find the common difference (CD): by subtracting the terms preceding the starting term, we get CD:  \n90 - 83 = 7, 97 - 90 = 7, 104 - 97 = 7 and so on. So, CD = 7.\nc) The last term in the sequence is 2008. We need to find the number of terms (NT) from the starting term to the last term.\nNT = (Last Term \u2013 Starting Term) / CD + 1\nNT = (2008 \u2013 83) / 7 + 1 = 289. \nHence, there are 289 integers belong to this arithmetic sequence.",
        " Solution 1: Using the formula for the arithmetic sequence\nOur sequence is arithmetic because the difference between successive terms is constant. We know what that constant difference is by finding $d$, the difference between two terms.\nSo, the difference between $83$ and $90$ is $90 - 83 = 7$. There are many other ways to get this difference. The difference between $90$ and $97$ is $7$, and the difference between $97$ and $104$ is $7$ as well, and so on. Because of this, we know that $d = 7$.\nWe know that the terms in the sequence follow the formula $$a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d,$$ where $a_1$ is the first term, which in this case is $83$, $n$ is the term number, and $d$ is the difference. To solve for $n$ when $a_n = 2008$, we must first subtract $83$ from $2008$, which gives $2008 - 83 = 1925$. Now, we substitute $1925$ for $a_n$ in the formula above, with $a_1 = 83$ and $d = 7$.\n$1925 = 83 + (n - 1) \\cdot 7$ Since $7$ is a prime number and the difference between successive terms in an arithmetic sequence must be an integer, the only factors given by $1925$ that include $7$ are $7$, $7\\cdot5$, $7\\cdot 7$, etc. If we factor out $7$, we obtain $7(275)$. This means that $275$ times $7$ is equal to $1925$, and so we have $1925 = 7(n - 1)$.\nNow we must subtract $7$ from both sides of the equation, which results in $1925 - 7 = 7(n - 1) - 7$. $1925 - 7 = 1918$ and $7(n - 1) - 7 = 7n - 14$, and we know that $1918 = 7n - 14$. From this we obtain $1918 + 14 = 7n - 14 + 14$.\nThe equation $1918 + 14 = 7n - 14 + 14$ is now equal to $1932",

        " \nWe will find out how many numbers belong in the sequence, thus we need to do the following:\n1. Find the initial term, a = 83.\n2. Find the difference between subsequent terms. Let d = a2 - a1 = 90 - 83 = 7.\n3. Let the common difference be d = 7.\n4. The final term in the sequence should be 20.\n### Calculation:\nThe last number in the given sequence is 2008, find it: profit = a + n-1 * d = 83 + 235 * 7 = 2008.\n### Calculation:\nTo get the arithmetic sequence length, the calculation should be: 2008 = 83 + (235-1)*7, so n = 237.\n### End Guide:\nThe end result is 237. Thus, 237 integers belong to the arithmetic sequence 83, 90, 97, 104, \u2026, 2008.
