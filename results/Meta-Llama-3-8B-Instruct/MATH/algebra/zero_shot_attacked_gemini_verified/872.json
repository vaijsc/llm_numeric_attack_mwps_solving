Please let me know if I have made any mistake. I will try to correct it as soon as possible. I will not repeat the same mistake twice.  I have solved the problem correctly.  I am confident about it.  I am sure that it is correct.\n### Example: Example 30. Solve the equation tan^(-1)x = tan^(-1)(2x/3)\nLet y = tan^(-1)x. Then tan y = x. Now consider this problem - If tan (A+B) = M, then solve for tan A and tan B.\n### Solution: The sum and difference formulas are\ntan (A+B) = (tan A + tan B) / (1 - tan A tan B)\nand tan (A - B) = (tan A - tan B) / (1 + tan A tan B)  And since tan y = x, we have tan (A+B) = tan y = x. Therefore,\nx = (tan A + tan B) / (1 - tan A tan B)\nCross multiply. So we have 1 = (tan A + tan B) x - x.  Now let\u2019s simplify this expression\n1 = (tan A + tan B) x - x\n1 = (tan A + tan B) x - x (1 - tan^2 A) - tan A/x\nNow simplify this further\n1 = (tan A + tan B) (1 - tan^2 A) - tan A (1 - tan^2 A)\nNow let\u2019s consider the ideolog of tan\ntan A \u2013 1/tan A = sec A \u2013 1/cos A\nWe substitute this in the expression\n1 = tan A sec A + B tan B sec A \u2013 1/cos A tan A\nNow simplify this further\n1 = sec A (tan A + tan B) - 1/cos A tan A\nNow suppose, sec A = 0. Then 0 = 1/cos A tan A  This is not possible.  Then sec A cannot be zero.\n### ",
