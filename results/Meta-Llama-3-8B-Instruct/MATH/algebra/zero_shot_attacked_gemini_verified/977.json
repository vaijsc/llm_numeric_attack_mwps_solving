        " We see that Eric's sports car has a $700$ horsepower engine. To go to power in kilowatts, we first convert this horsepower to watts: we have that $1$ horsepower $= 746$ watts (as $1$ watt $= 1$ joule per second), so we have that $700\\times746$ watts $= \\boxed{519,800}$ watts. Then, we have that\n$$1\\text{ } \\text{kilowatt }=1000 \\text{ watts},$$but\n$$519,800 \\text{ watts}\\div 1000 = 519.8 \\text{ } \\text{kilowatts}.$$As the answer should be rounded to the nearest kilowatt, the final answer is $\\boxed{520}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 520.

We also know that $1$ kilowatt is equivalent to $1.36$ horsepower, so $1$ horsepower is equivalent to $1/1.36 = \\frac{1000}{1360} = 0.736196$ kilowatts. Therefore, the car's engine can generate $700 \\times 0.736196$ kilowatts.\nThe multiplication yields a result with many digits after the decimal point, so using a calculator obtain approximately $\\boxed{0.512277}$ kilowatts.\nSince we are required to answer to the nearest kilowatt, the final answer is $\\boxed{0.5}$ kilowatts.

        " Solution\nTo find the engine power in kilowatts, we first need to convert the engine power from horsepower to units of watts. We know that $1$ kilowatt is equivalent to $1000$ watts, and $1$ horsepower is equivalent to $746$ watts (and $1.36$ horsepower, according to the problem). So we can write\n\\begin{align*} 700\\text{ horsepower} &= 700\\text{ horsepower}\\cdot\\frac{746\\text{ watts}}{1\\text{ horsepower}} = 520,800\\text{ watts}, \\\\ &= 520,800\\text{ watts}\\cdot\\frac{1\\text{ kilowatt}}{1000\\text{ watts}} = 520.8\\text{ kilowatts}.\\end{align*}So the engine power is approximately $\\boxed{0.521}$ kilowatts.

I hope it is correct. If $1$ kilowatt is equivalent to $1.36$ horsepower, then $1$ horsepower is equivalent to $\\frac{1}{1.36} = 0.7358$ kilowatts. So, $700$ horsepower is equivalent to $700 \\cdot 0.7358 = 0.952$ kilowatts.

        " 0.512\n1. The first step in this question is to convert 700 horsepower to a unit we're more familiar with, which is a unit that we can convert directly to kilowatts. In this case, because we're given the information that 1 kilowatt is equivalent to 1.36 horsepower, this step takes care of itself. We convert 700 horsepower directly into its equivalent value in kilowatts.\n### ",
        " **7290\\approx72$**\n### Solution Step-by-Step:\nWe need to convert $700$ horsepower to kilowatts (the equivalent unit). The given information tells us that $1$ horsepower is equivalent to $\\frac{1}{1.36} = 0.735839$ kilowatts, so\n\\begin{align*}\n700 \\times 0.735839 = 513.386670 = \\boxed{513} \\mathbf{kW} + 0.69\\mathbf{kW}.\\end{align*} The second decimal place is rounded, as directed to the nearest kilowatt. We recall that $1$ kilowatt is equivalent to $1000$ watts, and since\n$$\\frac{1}{1000} = 0.000001000 = 10^{-3},$$\nor to three significant figures, we can convert 0.69\\mathbf{kW}\\approx0.7\\mathbf{kW}. Providing additional justification for rounding, we find that $$\\begin{array}{l}\\boxed{\\SI{513}{\\kilo\\watt}}\\approx\\boxed{513}\\mathbf{kW}.$$ It is given that $1$ kilowatt is equal to $1.36$ horsepower.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 72.

        " First, let\u2019s note that $700$ horsepower is equal to $700\\cdot (1/1.36) = \\boxed{514.71}$ kilowatts. Therefore, $700$ horsepower equals $514.71$ kilowatts.",
        " Software Solution\nA computer algebra system (CAS) or calculator can be used to help or solve this problem. Let's use a CAS in this solution.\nWe are told that one kilowatt is equivalent to 1.36 horsepower. That helps us to set up an equation. If x represents the number of kilowatts, then we can set up the equation:\n700 = 1.36x\nTo solve for x, we can divide both sides by 1.36:\nx = 700 / 1.36\nEvaluating this expression with a calculator, we find\nx = 515.1763\nSince we are asked to round off to the nearest kilowatt, we will round 515.1763 down to 515. Therefore, Eric's sports car's engine generates 515 kilowatts of power.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 515. I hope it is correct.nested\nThis will be modified immediately after posting to show the answer with nested quotation marks, e.g. \"The final answer is 515\".\nAlternatively, you can solve it without using a CAS or calculator:\n$$1\\text{ k-watt}=\\frac{700\\ \\text{hp}}{1.36}$$\nk-watt = 515.1763 Therefore, the answer is 515 (rounded off to the nearest kilowatt).\n#### Warning for Hassan\nA \"1 horsepower is equivalent to approximately 0.7457 kilowatts\" is used here. It is True that, but you should not use it here. The correct meaning of the question is \"1 kilowatt is equivalent to 1.36 horsepower\".\nAre our friends correct?\nAlthough it is true that 1 horsepower is equivalent to approximately 0.7457 kilowatts, this information is irrelevant in this problem. What we really need are the conversion factors:\n1 kilowatt = ?? horsepower\n1 horsepower = ?? kilowatts\nFrom the information we are given, we know that\n1 kilowatt = 1.36 horsepower\nThis is what we should use in our unit conversion. So, the correct conversion is:\n700 horsepower = 700/1.36 = 515 kilowatts\nThere is no mention of the reciprocal conversion, so don't bring it up unless your teacher or instructor asks for it, but essentially you can see that\n700 horsepower = 700 x 0.7457 = 522.19 kilowatts\nBut like I",
