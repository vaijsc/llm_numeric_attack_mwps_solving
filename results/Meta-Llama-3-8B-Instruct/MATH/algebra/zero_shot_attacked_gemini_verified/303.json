I hope it is correct.### Comment:Hello, this problem calls for the simplification of $(x\\sqrt{x^3})^8$. So we do that step by step. First, we add the exponents of $x$ together. So the exponent of $x$ in $(x\\sqrt{x^3})^8$ is $1+3/2$. Then we simplify the exponent by combining the fractional part with the whole part. So the exponent of $x$ in $(x\\sqrt{x^3})^8$ is $5/2$. Finally, we multiply the exponent of $x$ in the exponents of $(x^{5/2})^8$. So the exponent of $x$ in $(x\\sqrt{x^3})^8$ is $10$. Hence the final answer is $\\boxed{10}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 10. I hope it is correct.### Comment:Hello, the final answer of 10 is correct. Well done. You have simplified $(x\\sqrt{x^3})^8$ and arrived at the correct final answer, $x^{10}$. That shows great problem-solving skills. We hope you will continue to practice simplifying expressions like this to become even better at it.### Comment:Thank you for the response and the additional words of encouragement.
