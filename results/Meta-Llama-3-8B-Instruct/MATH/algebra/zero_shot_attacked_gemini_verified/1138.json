        " First, we can use the points we have to create a system of equations. The graph passes through $(3,5)$ so $(3,5)$ satisfies the equation. So, \\begin{align*}5&=a(3)^2+b(3)+c\\\\\n\\Rightarrow 5&=9a+3b+c\\end{align*}Then the graph passes through $(1,10)$ so $(1,10)$ also satisfies the equation. So,\\begin{align*}10&=a(1)^2+b(1)+c\\\\\n\\Rightarrow 10&=a+b+c.\\end{align*}Then the graph passes through $(2,19)$ so $(2,19)$ also satisfies the equation. So,\\begin{align*}19&=a(2)^2+b(2)+c\\\\\n\\Rightarrow 19&=4a+2b+c.\\end{align*}We can now substitute our values from equation 2 into equation 3 and eliminate $b+c$ between 1 and 3.

        " Let\u2019s write it out. I assume we are finding the sum of a, b, c.  1. We use the points to make 3 equations.  Equation 1: 5=a(3)\u00b2+b(3)+c     Equation 2: 10=a(1)\u00b2+b(1)+c     Equation 3: 19=a(2)\u00b2+b(2)+c  2. Simplify each equation.  Equation 1: 5=9a+3b+c     Equation 2: 10=1a+b+c      Equation 3: 19=4a+2b+c\n3. After simplifying, we can solve the system using substitution, elimination, or not.  For this problem, I use elimination.  So, we multiply Equation 2 by -1 to eliminate c.  and add the two equations for Equation 4.  -10=-1a-1b-c  + 5=9a+3b+c    +(-5)=8a+2b\n4. Simplify. 8a+2b=-5  After simplifying, we then isolate b.  8a+2b=-5  -2b=-8a-5   So, b=-4a-5/2\n5. Now we go back to Equation 1 and substitute for b to solve for a.  5=9a+3(-4a-5/2)+c   5=9a-12a-15/2+c   5=-3a-15/2+c    [Multiply both sides by 2]  10=-6a-15+c   25=-6a+c\nNow solve for a.  25=c-6a  Now subtract c from both sides to get a.  25-c=-6a  a=-25+c/6\n6.
