This gives $\\boxed{x = \\frac{5y}{4}}$.\n#### Step 2: Plug into the expression\nNow, we substitute the expression for x into the given expression $\\frac{2x+y}{3x-2y}$ to get $\\frac{2[\\frac{5y}{4}]+y}{3[\\frac{5y}{4}]-2[y]}$. Simplify the expression to get $\\frac{\\frac{10y}{4}+y}{\\frac{15y}{4}-2y}$. Let\u2019s make the denominator easier to work with by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by 4: $\\frac{\\frac{10y}{4}\\cdot4+y\\cdot4}{\\frac{15y}{4}\\cdot4-2y\\cdot4}$. Then, we evaluate the expressions in the numerator and denominator to get $\\frac{10y+y}{15y-8y}=\\frac{11y}{7y}$. Finally, simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 7 to get $\\boxed{\\frac{11}{7}}$.\n#### Mark your answer.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\frac{11}{7}.

Step 1: Simplify Let\u2019s write both sides of the equation as a single expression with respect to y. First, we divide both sides of the equation by 4 to obtain $\\frac{4x}{4} \\neq \\frac{5y}{4}$. This gives $x=\\frac{5y}{4}$. Step 2: Plug into the expression Now, we substitute the expression for x into the given expression $\\frac{2x+y}{3x-2y}$ to get $\\frac{2[\\frac{5y}{4}]+",
