Since a reflection is the inverse of the line, the reflection of (5,9) is (-5,9).",
        " This problem can be better explained with the help of a graph.\nLet\u2019s think step by step.\nIf we know that $(5,9)$ is on the graph of $y=f(x)$, we can conclude that $f(5)=9$. Now, we need to look at the graph of $y=f(-x)$. If we plug in $-x$ in place of $x$, then it is the same as reflecting the point across the $y$-axis.\nSo, if we see the point $(5,9)$, its reflection across the $y$-axis will become $(-5,9)$. Since the $x$-coordinate of $(-5,9)$ has become negative, it means that the point $(-5,f(-5))$ must lie on the graph of $y=f(-x)$. Hence, the sum of its coordinates is $\\boxed{-5+9=4}$.",

This means that\nf(x) has the property that for any $y=f(x)$, $-x$ would also be on the graph $y=f(u)$, if $y=f(u)$. This means that we could write\nf(u)=f(-u).\nSo now we want to find a point $(x,y)$ such that $f(-x)=y$. Plugging in $u=-x$, we get\nf(-x)=f(x),\nwhich is exactly what we have.\nThis gives $f(x)=9$ (because we know $f(5)=9$), so\nf(5)=9. Then $f(-5)=9$, so $x=-5, y=9$ is a point which must be on the graph $y=f(-x)$. Then the sum of the coordinates is\n-x +y = -5+9=\\boxed{4}",
        " Since $(5,9)$ is on the graph of $y=f(x)$, we know that $f(5)=9$.
