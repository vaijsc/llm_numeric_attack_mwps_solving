The\nThe equation of a line can be expressed in the form $y = mx + c$, where $m$ is the slope of the line and $c$ is the y-intercept.  The slope of a line through two points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ is given by \\begin{equation*}\nm =\\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}.\n\\end{equation*}\nUsing this equation, we can find out the slope $m$ of the line using the given points. \\begin{align*}\nm& =\\frac{-2-6}{-4-(-5)}\\\\\n& =\\frac{-8}{1}\\\\\n& =-8.\n\\end{align*}  Now, the y-intercept $c$ can be determined by plugging in one of the known points into the form $y = -8x + c$, which is $y = -8(-5) + c$ or $y = 38 + c$.  Therefore, we know that the point $(-5,6)$ is on the line, and so we can set $y=6$ in our equation. \\begin{align*}\n6& =38+c\\\\\nc& =-32.\n\\end{align*}  Therefore, the equation of the line is $y = -8x + (-32)$, and the y-intercept is $\\boxed{(-32,0)}$ or $-32$.\n### Explanation: A line can be defined by its slope, $m$, and its y-intercept, $c$.  In this case, the line has slope $-8$, meaning it moves down $8$ units for every $1$ unit it moves to the right.  Additionally, the line passes through the $y$-axis at $c = -32$.  Therefore, the line must also pass through the point $(0,-32)$ on the $y$-axis.  So, the y-coordinate at the point where the line intersects the $y$-axis is $\\boxed{-32}$.  Finally, the given points are $(-5,6)$ and $(-4,-2)$",
        " \nTo find the y-coordinate, we can use the point-slope form of a line, which is: \\begin{aligned} y-y_1 = m(x-x_1) \\end{aligned} Here $m$ is the slope of the line, $x_1$ and $y_1$ are known points on the line. We have $x_1 = -5$, $y_1 = 6$ for the first point, and $x_1 = -4$, $y_1 = -2$ for the second point.
