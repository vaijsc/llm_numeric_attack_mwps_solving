        " Given $4^a = 32$ and $a^b = 125$ find $b^a$.\n$4^a = 32$ means $4^a = 2^5$ which implies $a = \\log_4 2^5 = 5/2$.\n$a^b = 125$ so $5/2^b = 5^2$ implies $b = 2$.\nNow, $b^a = 2^{5/2}$ which simplifies to \\boxed{4}.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 4. I hope it is correct.### ",
        " $32 = 2^5$, thus $4^a = (2^2)^a = 2^{2a} = 2^5$, so $2a = 5$. Therefore, $a = 5/2$.\n$a^b = 125 = 5^3$, thus $5^{2b/2} = 5^3$, so $2b/2 = 3$ and $b = 6$.\nNow, $b^a = 6^{5/2} = 30$. Hence, the answer is $\\boxed{30}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 30. I hope it is correct."
