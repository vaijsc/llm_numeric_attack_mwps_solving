Then, the revenue is $\\$2.75x$and the cost is $ \\$0.50x+1400$. The profit is positive when $x$ is greater than 1120, which means the company should sell at least $\\boxed{1121}$ widgets.\n===== I've edited the solution again.

So, its marginal profit is $\\2.25$ per widget. We want to find out when this marginal profit adds up to or exceeds the initial cost of $\\$1400.$Let$x$ be the number of widgets it will sell, then we have\nthe total profit = $2.25x-1400.$\nSince this profit should be positive, it must be greater than or equal to zero.\n$$\\Rightarrow 2.25x-1400\\ge 0.$$This implies that:\n$$2.25x\\ge 1400\\Rightarrow x\\ge \\frac{1400}{2.25}=\\frac{2800}{5}=560.$$Since$x$is an integer, we need to pick the least integer greater than or equal to 560.

        " \nIf the company makes a profit, then it will still have some money left after paying the fees. Since the fees are $\\$1400,$the company can only have a profit after it explains $\\$1400$in fees. So, we first have to figure out how much money the company will make if it makes some widgets. Then we can find out what that means is how many it makes, because we know how much we make for each widget and how much the widget costs to make. So, let\u2019s compute the difference between the amount it makes and how much it costs for each widget. So the cost of each widget is $\\$0.50.$The selling price is$\\$2.75$. So, the company will make\n$2.75-0.50 = 2.25$\n dollars for each widget it makes.\nSince the total amount of money we want to make, and the total costs, let\u2019s think of it as a big equation.\n$a + c = x$\n$x - (1400) = profit$\n$a + c = 2.25 n$\n(a number of widgets we have produced)\nand\n$2.25n - (1400) = profit$\nNote: 1.25n = 1400\n$\\frac{1.25n}{1.25} = \\frac{1400}{1.25}$\n$1n = \\frac{1400}{1.25}$\n$\\frac{1400/1.25}{1} = 1120$\n$1120 = n$\nTherefore, we must sell no less than 1120 widgets in order to make a profit. It\u2019s essential to keep in mind that we may not have to sell more widgets, but it\u2019s the minimum number we must sell to make a profit. We could even sell 3000 widgets and make a profit if we also have some other investments or expenses or earning some extra cash. But here, we are considering this company situation, so let\u2019s decide one depends on this math. If you really want, you can run this job again with all these percentages depending on this principle, but I think you can figure it out.\nSo we make at least one of our first significant pioneers\n### Decision: ",
        " We have to pay$1400$in one-time equipment fees. That means our total cost for the first widget is$2.00$since$800$is paid once and another$0.50$is paid. Although we make a profit of$1.75$from one widget, our net profit is$0.75. So, we need$1 / 0.75 =$133.33... widgets to break even (including paying the initial equipment fee). Now, let us calculate our total revenue, total cost, and profit. In order to make a profit, our revenue should be greater than our cost. Therefore, we must have $(2.75)n (0.50)n+1400$. To find the least number of widgets to sell in order to make a profit, we can write an equation: \\begin{align*} 2.75n-0.50n &> 1400 \\\\ 2.25n &> 1400 \\\\ n &> 1400 / 2.25 \\\\ n &> 621.78 \\\\ \\boxed{n \\ge 622} \\end{align*} We can see that the smallest integer value of$n$to make a profit is 622. Final Answer: The final answer is 622. I hope it is correct. ### Another simple way to do the problem is as follows:  Let$P=1400+0.50n-2.75n$. Then, we want to find the smallest integer value for$n$such that$P>0$or$\\Pgeq 0$. To do that, first we take the common term$0.50n$in one side and $-2.75n$in another side, so we find out $0.50n-0.50n-2.75n=1400$ $0.50n-2.75n=1400$ $-2.25n=1400$ $n=-1400/2.25<0$ So, there is no solution for this inequality by graphing the equation $y=0.50x-2.75x-1400$, which is a decreasing linear equation and never touches the x-axis. From the top left to bottom right, it means the graph \"falls forever\" and that we never have a solution. So, we will now prove that $P<0$ for all $n$ where $n\\leq621$ or for",
        " The best way to approach this problem is by setting our profit function. Let us suppose that the number of widgets we sell is $x$ so the company will get $2.75x$ in dollars. The cost has two parts. The company has to pay $\\$1400\\\\$ first and varying according to widgets made, that is$\\$0.5x.$ So the profit after income and cost will be$$2.75x-(0.5x+1400).$$Simplifying the above expression we get,$$2.75x-0.5x-1400=2.25x-1400.$$ For making a profit, we should have the value of the above expression positive i.e., $$2.25x-1400>0.$$ Solving this, we get $$x > \\frac{1400}{2.25}=633.33.$$ So if we make 634 widgets the least number of widgets to make a profit. Final Answer: The final answer is 634. I hope it is correct. #### Correct Answer: The company has to sell at least$2.25 \\times 634 - 1400 = 1431.50$to make a profit, but we know already that it is equal to or more than 1661.33, so they must sell 1661 widgets. As 1661 is the closest integer to 1661.33, therefore we are easily able to see that this choice is not correct and the correct answer is 1661. Hence, we will consider the next number i.e. 1662. Therefore, it is equal to or more than 2119.00. Hence, the correct answer is 1662. Final Answer: The final answer is 1662.

        " The total cost for this problem is the equipment fee of $\\$1400$and the cost of all widgets sold that day in terms of the number of widgets sold. To express this in a specific algebraic manner, this problem can be written as the equation \\begin{align*} 1400+0.50n&=2.75n.\\end{align*}We need to find the minimum number of widgets to sell in order to have a profit, so we need to find the minimum value of$n$that makes the right-hand side greater than the left-hand side. To solve this equation, we can subtract$0.50n$from both sides and then subtract$1400$from both sides, which yields \\begin{align*} 0.25n&=-1400\\\\ \\Rightarrow n&=-1400/0.25\\\\&=5600.\\end{align*}This value is far beyond the actual value of$n$we are looking for, since the company needs to make a profit.

This equation can then be solved by dividing both sides by 7, resulting in the minimum integer value of n=400. Final Answer: The final answer is 400. I hope it is correct.  Final Answer: The final answer is 400. I hope it is correct. #### Why do we need the least number of widgets in order to make a profit? Initially, I would say that any number of widgets sold would be profitable. However, as we see in this question, the question is asking for the \"least number of widgets the company has to sell in order to make a profit.\" This question has a twist: if we don't need to make a profit, then any number of widgets would be profitable as long as we're selling them. If we want to make a profit, though, then",

It sells widgets at a price of $2.75$ per widget. What is the smallest number of widgets the company must sell to make a profit? First, let's add the equipment fee to the cost of making each widget $x$. $1400 + 0.50x$. We also need to consider the revenue of the widgets, $2.75x$. The equation to consider is: $1400 + 0.50x = 2.75x - p$ Start by moving everything to one side of the equation, including the variable $p$ (which we don't know yet). $0.25x = p + 1400$ Then, we can subtract $p$ and $1400$ from both sides. $0.25x = 1400 + (p - 1400)$ Reduce the right side of the equation to just$p$,$0.25x = p To make a profit, we need to make sure that total revenue is more than the total cost.

To make a profit, the company will have to sell some widgets to overcome the loss caused by this cost.\n### Let\u2019s create three cases:\n1) The company sells exactly one widget.\n(answer: $2800>1400$ + $0.5$ + $2.75$, so 1 unity Widgets are not sold (the answer is not correct)\n2) The company sells exactly two widgets.\n(answer: $2 * 2.75$ - $0.5>1400$)\n### Foul-Up! In order for the company to make a profit, we must have a positive profit in both the case where they sell two widgets and the case where they sell three widgets (and more). Therefore, 2 widgets are not the answer.  We cannot have a profit with 2 widgets. That means that if we sell one widget, we will have a loss.\n### Sohow do we procced the descent so that we are able to make a profit from two widgets?\n$1400$must be $\\$(0.50 + 2.75)2$ Widgets because we need the value of the two widgets to be $\\$ 1400$or so in total value. In this case, we need$2800-1400=1400/1400=2$ widgets and answer is correct.\n### Your Answer to the Appealed/ Agreed Case: 2 Because we need a profit for$ 1400$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2. I hope it is correct. Consider the following: if the company sells widgets for 2 weeks at a rate of 20 widgets per day on the first week and 30 widgets per day on the second and third weeks. And the company sells these 20 widgets and the 2 widget in the second and 2 widgets on the third. What is the pros and cons.\n#### Pros: 1-) A lot of people get paid to work here. 2-) This company will have a profit after the two weeks) Answer: 2 widget Answer: Final Answer: The final answer is 2. I hope it is correct. I will rate the Q.A. is (50%) because the company\u2019s sales are not profitable (chunk sequence market) Here is a definition: Market forces, such as the supply and demand for widgets, would cause the company to make a profit",
        "  Let $w$ be the number of widgets the company has to sell in order to make a profit.  Then it costs $\\1400 + 0.50w$ to sell the widgets, and it is paid $2.75w$ by selling the widgets.  Therefore, we need $2.75w > 1400 + 0.50w,$ or equivalently $2.25w > 1400,$ which is true for $w > \\frac{1400}{2.25} \\approx 619.05$.  Thus, we need to have $w \\ge \\boxed{620}$.\nLet\u2019s think step by step.\n### ",
        " If the company sells $x$ widgets, then it gets a revenue of $\\$2.75x$. It has costs, though \u2014 the one-time fee of $\\$1400$plus$\\$0.50x$ for the widgets themselves. So its profit, $P$, is given by the equation $P = 2.75x - 0.50x - 1400.$ We want to find the smallest positive integer, $x$, such that $P \\ge 0$ (so it shows a profit). This means we need to find the smallest value of $x$ that satisfies $P \\ge 0$, or $2.25x \\ge 1400$, or $x \\ge 1400 / 2.25 = 620$. Since $x$ has to be an integer, the smallest possible value of $x$ is $621$. That means it would have to sell at least $621$ widgets in order to make a profit.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 621. I hope it is correct. ### Correct or incorrect? Final Answer: The final answer is 621. I hope it is correct. Yes, that is correct! Well done! The answer is indeed $\\boxed{621}$. By setting up the equation $P = 2.75x - 0.50x - 1400$ (as you did) and solving for $x$, we can find that the smallest value of $x$ that makes $P \\ge 0$ is indeed $\\boxed{621}$. Good job! (Note: You could also .) ### Another solution?payer It would have to make more than 1400 dollars in order to break even, and then some to make a profit. If x = 620, the company is still not in the black, so it is always better to make a profit by selling one more widget, x = 621. Thus, it has to sell at least 621 widgets. Final Answer: The final answer is 621. I hope it is correct. Yes, that is correct! Again, we get the same answer: It would have to make more than $\\$1400$in order to break even, and then some to make a profit. If $x = 620$, the company is still not in the black, so it is always better to make a profit by selling one more widget, $x = 621$. Thus, it has to sell at least $\\",
        " We can translate the information above to a function of n, where n is the number of widgets to be sold:\n$$R(n) = 2.75n - 0.5n - 1400$$R is the revenue function for the above situation. Since we want to know the least number of widgets to be sold in order to make a profit, we can first find when the profit is zero:So,\n$0 = 2.75n - 0.5n - 1400 \\Rightarrow 1.25n = 1400 \\Rightarrow n = \\frac{1400}{1.25} = 1120$Thus, the company needs to sell at least 1121 widgets in order to break even. However, we need to find the least number of widgets. In other words, we need to check the profit for n = 1120. $$P(1120) = 2.75(1120) - 0.5(1120) - 1400 = 3060 - 560 - 1400 = 100$$This is a profit. Therefore, the least number of widgets the company needs to sell in order to make a profit is $\\boxed{1121}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 1121. I hope it is correct. ### Solution 4 In terms of profit Vn V n$$V$ $(n)$ = 2.75n 0.5n 1400 Since we want to find the least number of widgets needed to produce a profit, we must first determine when the profit becomes positive. So, 0 = 2.75n 0.5n 1400 1.25n = 1400 My answer sheet sometimes really messes things up. \\ n = \\frac{1400}{1.25} = 1120 V (1120) = 3060 560 1400 = 100 So, we have a profit. Thus, the least number of widgets the company needs to sell is 1121. Final Answer: The final answer is 1121. I hope it is correct. ### Solution 3 First, determine when the profit becomes positive:0 = 2.75n - 0.50n - 1400best ratio soles shoes \\ \\$0.50 2.75\n1.25n = 1400\nn = 1120\nn = 1120\n130\nn",
