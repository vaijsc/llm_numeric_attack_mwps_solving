In this article, we will explore the concept of radicals and how to simplify expressions that contain them.\n#What is a Radical?\nA radical is an expression that contains a square root or other root of a number. The most common radical is the square root, which is denoted by the symbol \u221a. For example, \u221a4 is a radical because it is the square root of the number 4.\n#Simplifying Radicals\nTo simplify a radical, we need to find the largest perfect square or cube that divides both the radicand (the number inside the radical) and the index (the small number above the radical). For example, if we have the radical \u221a25, we can simplify it by finding the largest perfect square that divides both 25 and the index, which is 5.\n#Examples\nLet's practice simplifying radicals with some examples. \n1. Simplify the radical \u221a48.\nTo simplify this radical, we need to find the largest perfect square that divides both 48 and the index, which is 3. Therefore, we can simplify the radical by dividing it by 3.\n\u221a48 = \u221a(3 x 16) = \u221a3 x \u221a16 = \u221a3 x 4 = 4\u221a3\n2. Simplify the radical 2\u221a12.\nTo simplify this radical, we need to find the largest perfect square that divides both 12 and the index",
