        " In the equation $57^{36n}=81^{48}$, let\u2019s first try to simplify the right-hand side. $81 = 9^2=3^4$, so we have $$57^{36n}=(3^2)^{48}.$$Next, $36n = 4m$, where $m$ is an integer. Therefore, this can be written as $$57^{4m}=(3^2)^{48}.$$We can further simplify $57$ and $3^2$ to $3^2\\cdot7^2$. So, the equation becomes $$3^{8m}\\cdot7^{8m}=(3^2)^{48}.$$Remembering that $48=2\\cdot24$, we see that $3^{96}=(3^2)^{48}$. Next, since $8m=96$ is divisible by 8, we can factor out $3^{8}$ from the left-hand side, which leads us to $3^{8(m-12)}\\cdot7^{8m}=(3^2)^{48}$.

We then have $a^2+2ab+b^2+2ac+c^2+2bc=9a^2+4b^2+4c^2$. Isolate $2ab$ and $2bc$, combining them to $4ab+2bc=9a^2+4b^2+4c^2-a^2-c^2-b^2$. We have $4ab+2bc=8a^2+4c^2$.
