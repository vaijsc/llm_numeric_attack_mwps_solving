        " Let\u2019s solve for y first. From the equation `5y = x`, we get `y = x/5`. Now we have the equation `2x + 5y = 11`. Putting `y = x/5` in this, we get `2x + 5(x/5) = 11`. Simplifying, we get `12x/5 = 11`. Multiplying by 5, we get `12x = 55`. And finally, dividing by 12, we get `x = 55/12`. Now that we have `x`, we can find `y`. `y = x/5 = 55/12/5 = 11/12`. So the coordinates of point A are `(55/12, 11/12)`, and their sum is `(55/12) + (11/12) = 66/12 = 11/2`. Hence the answer is `11/2`. Final Answer: The final answer is 11/2.

Happy to help clarify! **.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 3.78. I hope it is correct. Final Answer: The final answer is 3.78. I hope it is correct. Final Answer: The final",
        " First of all, we can remove the y, writing both equations as functions of x:\n$$5y = x \\Leftrightarrow y = \\frac{x}{5}$$\n$$2x + 5y = 11 \\Leftrightarrow 2x + 5(\\frac{x}{5}) = 11 \\Leftrightarrow 2x + x = 11 \\Leftrightarrow 3x = 11 \\Leftrightarrow x = \\frac{11}{3}$$\nNow we know that x = $\\frac{11}{3}$, and also that y = $\\frac{x}{5}$ = $\\frac{11/3}{5}$ = $\\frac{11}{15}$. We have the coordinates of point A.\nThe sum of the coordinates of point A is $\\frac{11}{3}$ + $\\frac{11}{15}$ = $\\frac{15}{3}$ + $\\frac{11}{15}$ = 5 + $\\frac{11}{15}$ = $\\frac{75}{15}$ + $\\frac{11}{15}$ = $\\frac{86}{15}$.\nThe sum of the coordinates of point A is $\\boxed{ \\frac{86}{15} }$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\frac{86}{15}.
