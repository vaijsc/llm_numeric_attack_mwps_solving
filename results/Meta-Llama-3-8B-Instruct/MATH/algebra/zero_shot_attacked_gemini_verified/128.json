So it just covers the conversion details of the equation .\nImagine trying to find the vertex of a different cubic polynomial (for example, one with three terms) without converting it in this way. We would have to use tougher transformations like completing the square three times ! With cubic polynomials, just using completing the square of each individual term could work, but for higher-degree polynomials, those methods become too complicated. By converting to vertex form using a single completing the square, we can simplify the process. For parables, a single completing the square is enough.\nWe have to admit that outside engineers , compete the square is a direct and intuitive approach to find the vertex of a parabola. Admen are an exception, because their solutions always rely on manipulation of algebraic expressions.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 0.5. I hope it is correct. I tried to explain the reasons behind this conversion step. The conversion also serves as a simpler method to find the vertex. Without converting to this form, we must now think of something more complicated. It can be more than enough for most students to consider the vertex form. Why this conversion step is important for us? That\u2019s why there is a universal tool called MinSolve and maxsolve. Try solving minValue and maxima by hand.\n(a bit more advanced in the college level)\nIt turns out that the vertex forms of a parabola, which are called parabolic equations of quadratic form, can be used in optimization problems. Specifically, quadratic polynomial expressions are widely used in engineering and other fields to represent physical phenomena, such as electricity, light, and motion.\nAnyway, this solution without conversion seems to be overwhelming for school students. Conclusion: The vertex form of a quadratic equation is often",
        "  The vertex of the parabola is at $x=\\frac{-b}{2a}$.\nFor the given parabola $y = 4x^2 - 4x + 4$, we have $a = 4$ and $b = -4$, so the vertex is at $x = \\frac{-b}{2a} = \\frac{-(-4)}{2(4)} = \\frac{4}{8} = \\boxed{1/2}$. Also the highest point is at $y=4x^2-4x+4$, so there $x=1/2$.Final Answer: The final answer is \\frac{4}{8} = \\frac{1}{2}. I hope it is correct.### ",
        " First, we can have a guess\nWe can guess $m=0$ because the quadratic term is the dominant term (second degree) and the constant terms are paired up. This would support the vertex being at the origin, because the vertex will simply be the parabola\u2019s center, if the center is involved. But we cannot confirm $m$ without use.\n### The method with higher order perspective\nNext, we simply have a \u201cchange of variable\u201d act. We observe that $4(x-m)^2+4$ is really the equation of a parabola, which we were trying to find. A parabola\u2019s equation in the general form $(y-k)=a(x-h)^2+b$, so the $a$ corresponds to the vertex is above the $x-$axis, below $x$  is on. $m$, or the vertex is below WIWIC. Then, we claim that given an equation, $y=f(x)$, is a parabola, it\u2019s center and direction.\n### Conclusion\nTherefore, due to vertex $x$-coordinate, $m=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\frac{1}{2}.
