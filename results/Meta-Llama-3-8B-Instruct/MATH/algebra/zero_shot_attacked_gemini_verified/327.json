        " As both $p(t)$ and $q(t)$ are seventh-degree polynomials in $t$, $p(t)$ has the form $a_{0}+a_{1}t+\\cdots+a_{7}t^{7}$ where $a_{0},a_{1},\\ldots,a_{7}$ are scalars in the base field, and $q(t)$ has the same form with possibly different scalars. Therefore, the product $p(t)\\cdot q(t)$ is a polynomial with terms\n$$a_{i}a_{j}t^{i+j}$$\nfor $i$, $j=0,1,\\ldots,7$, where we take the sum over all possibilities. Now, notice that the degree of the term with the highest power of $t$, which will be our answer, is the sum $i+j$. The highest possible value for $i+j$ is $7+7=14$, since we can have $i=7$ and $j=7$, or $i=6$ and $j=1$, or vice versa, and so on. Therefore, $p(t)\\cdot q(t)$ is a 14th-degree polynomial in $t$.

        " \nThe degree of a polynomial is the highest power of $t$ in the polynomial. In this case, the degree of $p(t)$ is 7, and the degree of $q(t)$ is 7. \nThe product of two polynomials is the sum of the products of corresponding terms from each of the polynomials (in case corresponding terms are not always there). So, $p(t)\\cdot q(t)$ is the sum of terms with the product of the highest powers of $t$ from each polynomial (7x7 terms), the sum of terms with the product of the next highest powers of $t$, and so forth, \nwhich has a highest power of $t$ as $7+7=14$, so we can say that $p(t)\\cdot q(t)$ is a 14th degree polynomial in $t$. So, the final answer is 14. \n### Explanation: \nHere, we are asked that if both $p(t)$ and $q(t)$ are seventh degree polynomial in $t$, then, what is the degree of their product $p(t)q(t)$?\n  Now, degree of the polynomial is the highest power of the variable which appears in the polynomial. In the given problem, both the polynomials are seventh degree polynomial. So, highest power of $t$ in $p(t)$ and $q(t)$ is $t^7$, respectively.\nNow, highest power of $t$ in the product $p(t)q(t)$, there are $t^7$ from $p(t)$ and $t^7$ from $q(t)$, so, highest power of $t$ in $p(t)q(t)$ is $t^7+t^7=t^{14}$, which is the 14th degree polynomial. \nTherefore, the answer is 14.\n### My Take:\n1. Both $p(t)$ and $q(t)$ are 7th degree polynomials. \n2. The product $p(t)\\cdot q(t)$ is the sum of the products of corresponding terms from each polynomial.\n3. So, the product will have 7x7 terms (the highest power of $t$ from each polynomial) and then 6x6 and 5x5 and so on.\n4. The highest power of $t$ in the product will be $t^{7+7}=t^{14}$.\n5. Therefore, $p(t)\\cdot q(t)$ is a 14",
        " $p(t)\\cdot q(t)$ is the product of two polynomials.

Similarly, $q(t)=dt^7+f\\cdot\\text{lower degree terms},$ where $d$ is a non-zero constant. Since the leading terms in $p(t)$ and $q(t)$ are $rt^7$ and $dt^7$, respectively, when we multiply them together, the leading term will be $(rd)t^7=rdt^7$. Thus, the degree of $p(t)\\cdot q(t)$ is $\\boxed{7}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 7. I hope it is correct.",
        " \nwe know that if $p(t)$ and $q(t)$ are both degree $n$ polynomials in $t$, then their product is a degree $n$ polynomial in $t$.  In other words, the degree of a product is not affected by the degree of the terms. So for example, $(t^2+2)(t^5-3)$ is a degree 7 polynomial.\nSince $p(t)$ and $q(t)$ are both degree $7$ polynomials, their product is degree $7$. For instance, if $p(t)=t^7$ and $q(t)=t^7,$ we have $p(t)\\cdot q(t)=t^{14}$, so the degree of $p(t)\\cdot q(t)$ is $14.$ Now, $(t^7+1)(t^7+1)$ is degree $7$. Therefore, the answer is $7$.",
        " Both $p(t)$ and $q(t)$ are seventh-degree polynomials. That means $p(t) = a_6 t^6 + a_5 t^5 + a_4 t^4 + a_3 t^3 + a_2 t^2 + a_1 t + a_0$ and $q(t) = b_6 t^6 + b_5 t^5 + b_4 t^4 + b_3 t^3 + b_2 t^2 + b_1 t + b_0$ where $a_6$ and $b_6$ are not $0$. Therefore $p(t) \\cdot q(t) = (a_6 b_6) t^{12} + (a_6 b_5+a_5 b_6) t^{11} + (a_6 b_4+a_5 b_5+a_4 b_6) t^{10} + ...$ and the highest power of this polynomial is $\\boxed{14}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 14. I hope it is correct.  ### Solution: Since both $p(t)$ and $q(t)$ are seventh-degree polynomials in $t$, the highest power of $t$ that appears in the product $p(t)\\cdot q(t)$ is the sum of the highest powers in $p(t)$ and $q(t)$, i.e., $t^6 + t^6 = t^{12}$. Therefore, the degree of $p(t)\\cdot q(t)$ is $\\boxed{\\text{14}}$.  Final Answer: The final answer is 14. I hope it is correct.  ### Feedback: The user correctly recognized that the highest power of $t$ in both $p(t)$ and $q(t)$ is $t^6$, and so the highest power in the product $p(t)\\cdot q(t)$ must be $t^{12}$. The user is unclear about where the $t^{6}$ terms come from (they are being added together), so they give the final answer as just $t^{12}$. Answer: 99.99 have a similar response.
