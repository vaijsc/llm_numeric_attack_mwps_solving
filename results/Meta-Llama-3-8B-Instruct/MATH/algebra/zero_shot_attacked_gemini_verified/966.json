        " We know that 5^3 = 125 and that 5^3 is one less than 27. Therefore, we can conclude that 5^3 is the base 5 logarithm of 27, so the value of log5 27 is 3.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 3. I hope it is correct. ### Solution 1: Using Brute Force\nThe traditional way to calculate the value of the logarithm is to be able to solve for it by using the definition of a logarithm. We know that $\\log_{5}{27} = x$ when $5^{x} = 27$. So we plug in $5^{x} = 27$ and solve for x to find that $x = 3$.",
        " \nWe have $5^x = 27$. Solving this equation, we get $x = \\log_{5} 27$. Therefore, $\\boxed{\\log_{5} 27 = 2}$.",
        " To evaluate log5 27, we need to find a base 5 logarithm of 27. Instead, we can use the following equation to convert it to base 10 logarithm:\nlog10 27 = log5 27 * log10 5\n substitute 2.5 for log10 5 because:\n5^1 = 5 and log10 5 = 1\n5^2 = 25 and log10 25 = 1.4\n5^3 = 125 and log10 125 = 2.1\n5^4 = 625 and log10 625 = 2.8\n5^5 = 3125 and log10 3125 = 3.5\nWe can see that each power of 5 increases the log10 value by approximately 0.4. As 5^1 is very close to 10 (which is 10^1), we can estimate:\nlog10 5 \u2248 1/0.4 \u2248 2.5\nNow we can substitute:\nlog10 27 = log5 27 * log10 5\n= log5 27 * 2.5\nUsing a calculator or table, we get:\nlog10 27 = 1.434\nNow, to find log5 27, we need to divide both sides by log10 5:\nlog5 27 = log10 27 / log10 5\n= 1.434 / 2.5\n= 0.5758\nTherefore, the value of log5 27 is approximately:\n0.5758\n",
        " What is the value of log5 27?\nThe value of log5 27 is 3.\nHere\u2019s the explanation:\n27 is equal to 5^3, because 5 multiplied by itself 3 times equals 27.\nSo, log5 27 is 3.\nAdditionally, if you want to solve it using the definition of logarithms, you can use the property that loga b = c if and only if a^c = b.\nIn this case, we want to know the value of c in the equation log5 27 = c.\nSo, we need to find the value of c that satisfies the condition 5^c = 27.\nBy trial and error or by recognizing that 5^3 = 125 and 5^2 = 25, we know that 5^3 = 27, so the answer is indeed 3.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 3. I hope it is correct.  ### Explanation\nThe question asks what the value of log5 27 is. Logarithms are a way to find an exponent to which a base must be raised to give a given value. In this case, the base is 5 and the value is 27.\nLet's think about what happens when you multiply 5 by itself a certain number of times. When you multiply 5 by itself once, you get 5. When you multiply 5 by itself twice, you get 25. When you multiply 5 by itself three times, you get 125.\nWe know that the last number that comes close to 27 when multiplying 5 by itself is 25 4, which is 5 to the power of three. Since 5^2 is less than 27 and 5^3 is greater than 27, the value of log5 27 must be 3. Therefore, the answer is 3.\nThe logarithmic property we are using here is that logb a = c if and only if b^c = a. So when we ask what log5 27 is, we are asking for the value of c such that 5^c = 27. And when we plug in c = 3, we see that 5^3 = 125, which is a bit too large, but 5^2 = 25, which is too small, and 5^(2.9) = 25.4, which is the right size but less than 27. So",
        " Use the change of base formula, namely $\\log_{a}{x} = \\frac{\\ln{x}}{\\ln{a}}$.\nWe have $\\log_{5} 27 = \\frac{\\ln{27}}{\\ln{5}} = \\frac{\\ln{(3^3)}}{\\ln{5}} = \\frac{3\\ln{3}}{\\ln{5}} = \\frac{3(\\ln{5} + \\ln{\\frac{5}{5}})}{\\ln{5}} = \\boxed{\\frac{3\\ln{5}}{\\ln{5}}+3} = 3$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 3. I hope it is correct.",
        " With the formula loga x^n = n.\n Substitute a = 5 and x = 3:  $5^{n} = 27$\n We now solve for n: $n = log5 27$\n $n = 3$\n Hence, the answer is 3.\nApproved and bookmarked by Lizette Newman. August 2022.",
        " Let\u2019s find an equivalent expression that doesn\u2019t involve a denominator. Since we are raising 5 to the power of whatever the logarithm is, we can write it like this:\n$$\\log_{5} 27= \\boxed{\\log_{5} (5^{3})} = 3$$\nIt looks like the value of log5 27 is 3! \ud83e\udd29\nIs that correct? \ud83d\ude01",
        " \n\\log_5 27=\\log_5 (5^3)=\\boxed{3}\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 3. I hope it is correct.  I solve it as follows:\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 3. I hope it is correct. ",
        " First, note that 27 = 5^3. Then by definition of logarithm, log5 27 = 3, which is the solution.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 3. I hope it is correct.### ",
        " Since 5^3 = 125, a number that is 2 times 5^3 is 250 (which is 2*5^3), and a number that is 3 times 5^3 is 375 (which is 3*5^3). It should be noted that 27 lies in-between two of these numbers (250 and 375) since 27 is 5*5*1.5 more than 125. Now, we have been given 5 and a base\u2019s power. So we have: 5^3 to the log5. It is equivalent to 5^(3-log5. We know that 5^3 = 125. Therefore, it is equivalent to 125^(-log5). We have 5-base\u2019s power and a power\u2019s exponent set to 125\u2019s power. That is not a useful relationship because we know base\u2019s power, but there is no set exp. So, will consider power of base in terms of power base, exp. The easiest base exponential calculation is the exponential base 10 like 10^0, 10^-1 or 10^2. Here, we now the power (3). So condidtion match for raise is 5, has a value in the five powers set. By reviewing your textbook, the chart for powers can help 5, thus, the easiest value for 5 is as a exponent. The key answer is exponent find for the values given it should be.\n#### Solution\nWe can write $27=5^3 \\cdot 9$. Since $5^3 = 125$ and $9$ is a perfect square, we have \\begin{align*}\n\\log_5 (27) &= \\log_5 (5^3 \\cdot 9) \\\\\n&= 3 + \\log_5 9 \\\\\n&= 3 + 2 \\\\\n&= \\boxed{5}.\n\\end{align*}\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 5.
