        " \nLet\u2019s think step by step.\nOriginally, she can buy 40 oranges for $8x$ cents each.\n40 oranges at $8x$ cents each means that the total cost is $40\\cdot8x$ cents. In cents, that\u2019s equivalent to 3200x cents.\nNow, the price rose to $12x$ cents per orange. You know how many cents 1 cent is worth, so you don\u2019t need to convert it to anything, it\u2019s already in cents. So for $12x$ cents per orange, if she buys X oranges, the total price will be 12xX cents.\nWe are given that the money is the same in both cases. That means 3200x = 12xX.\nSimplify the equation by dividing both sides by x. You get 32 = 12X.\nNow, divide both sides by 12. You get 2.666 = X.\nThat\u2019s not a whole number, but we don\u2019t care; we are just looking for the greatest whole number possible. 2 oranges would be 24, and 3 would be 36. That\u2019s 40 cents less. You can\u2019t divide huge decimal numbers into a set by another decimal number. You can only buy a set number of things.",
        " Let K be Kim\u2019s money. The cost of 40 oranges at 8x cents each equals 40 \\times 8x$. This means Kim\u2019s money is$40\\cdot 8x = K$. Now, let\u2019s translate Kim\u2019s money to 80x\\$. This way, we can represent it in terms of a single variable x.\n$K = 80x$Now, let\u2019s find how many oranges Kim can buy at 12x cents each. The cost of x oranges at 12x cents each equals 12x x$. The money left over, K - 12x x$, is equal to $80x - 12x x$. As before, let\u2019s simplify this expression.\\begin{align*}80x - 12x x &= 80x - 12x^2\\end{align*}(Note that the $x$ terms get simplified)$K - 12xx &= 80x - 12x^2Separating the terms, we have -12x^2+80x$ and this is greater than 0. To be certain, let us check if this is positive:\\begin{align*}\n12x^2-80x&\\ge 0\\\\\n12x^2-80x+100-100&\\ge 0\\\\\n(12x-10)(x-10)&\\ge 0\\end{align*}  Factoring the expression, we have (12x-10)(x-10)\\ge 0.  First, consider the expression 12x-10.  As x increases, 12x-10 also increases.  So, when $x > \\frac{10}{12}$, the expression 12x-10 is positive So, let\u2019s test what happens at x=6:\\begin{align*}12x-10&=12\\cdot6-10=72-10=62\\ge0\\end{align*}This is positive, as predicted.  Second, consider the expression x-10.  As x increases, x-10 increases as well.  So, when $x > 10$, the expression is positive Let\u2019s test what happens at x=11:\\begin{align*}x-10&=11-10=1\\ge0\\end{align*}This is positive, as predicted.  Combining what we found, the expression (12x-10)(x-10)",
        " How many oranges can Kim buy if four oranges cost 80x cents? How many oranges can Kim buy if one orange costs 12x cents? Compared the two problems:\nFour oranges cost 8x(4) = 32x cents. If four oranges cost 80x cents, then 80x divided by 32x is the ratio that 32x is over 80x.\n80x / 32x = 5/2.\nSo, four oranges would be equal to two ones at that price. The same reasoning applies to the two cents orange cost that we need:\nThe cost of four oranges at 12x cents each is 12x(4) = 48x. Four oranges cost 80x. It\u2019s the same as before, only the price has changed.\n80x / 48x = 5/3\nAt that price, four oranges would be the equivalent of 3/2 ones, so the number of oranges that you can buy depends on how much money Han has.\nLet\u2019s think step by step. Four oranges at $8x\\$ cents each cost $32x$ cents. If four oranges cost 80x cents, how many oranges can Kim buy if one orange costs 12x pennies?\nLet's compare the two problems. Four oranges at $8x\\$ cents each cost $8x\\cdot4=32x$ cents. If four oranges at 12x cents each cost 80x cents, what is the ratio of 32x cents over 80x cents?\nLet's calculate the ratio:\n80x/32x=2.5\n80x/32x=5/2\nNaN\nNaNQualitySpeaker\n80x/32x=5/2\n80x/32x=2.5\nSo, we can see that four oranges cost two and a half times more than one orange with a cost of $8x$ cents, and half as many times the cost of one orange at 12x cents. This means Kim can buy two and a half times more oranges at 8x cents than she can at 12x cents.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2.5. I hope it is correct. I hope Kim is... I hope Kim is... I hope you are... thank you!",
        " We rely on the assumption that Kim has a constant amount of money (CKM). \nThe problem asks how many oranges she can buy after the price increases. \nCKM implicitly means she was already able to buy 40 oranges initially, given that 40 oranges at $8x$ cents each is a total cost of $40(8x)=320x$ cents. \nCKM guarantees that she must have had $320x$ cents. \nNow we want to find out how many oranges she can buy when the new price is $12x$ cents per orange. \nLet\u2019s use $o$ to denote the number of oranges Kim can buy after the price rise. \nThe total cost after the price rise is $o(12x)$. \nCKM tells us this cost must be equal to the initial money Kim had. \nSet up the equation $o(12x)=320x$. \nIt simplifies to $o=320x/(12x)=\\boxed{80/3}$. \n### Notes: \n(1) Step 2: Since CKM implies the problem only considers how many oranges Kim can buy with the same amount of money after the price rise, we don\u2019t need to be concerned about how the money initially spent has been changed.\n(2) CKM indeed assumes that Kim always has the same amount of money before and after the price rise. This explains why we can only ask for how many more oranges she can buy after the price increase.\n(3) We also ignored the rest of the money in the bank, making the problem much simpler than it would be if we considered flowcharts or saved bills, thanks to the simplification introduced by CKM! \nFeel free to share your thoughts and any other explanations; ",
        " \n#### Solution 1 \u2013 Simple Interest/Profit Calculation:\nWe have $40 \\times 800$ cents ($8x$ cents each) = $\\$3200,$which means Kim can currently afford to buy 3200/100$ oranges.\n#### Since the price increases by a factor of$2 ,$ Kim now has$currency/piece$2$ \\begin{align*} 2x * (amount of money)\\$.\\$\n562.5 * 2 = 1125\nDivide by 12 to get 93.75, so kim can buy approximately 94 oranges.",
        " 40 oranges at 8x cents each is $40\\cdot 8x=320x$ cents.\nIf the price rose to $12x$ cents per orange, then 40 orange at that price would be $40\\cdot12x=480x$ cents.\nWe know that Kim only has enough money to buy $320x$ cents; so she only has enough to buy $\\frac{320x}{12x}= \\boxed{26.7} \\approx 27$ oranges.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 27.

        " Let $y$ be the number of oranges that could be bought at the new price.\nFirst of all, we have to know the amount of money that Kim has. At the original price, Kim can buy 40 oranges.

So she gets $12xy$ cents.  Equating the two amounts of money that she can buy, we have\n$$320x = 12xy.$$\nNow dividing both sides by $12x$, we find that\n\\begin{align*}\ny&=\\frac{320x}{12x}\\\\\ny&=\\boxed{20}.\n\\end{align*}\nTherefore, Kim can buy 20 oranges at the new price.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 20.
