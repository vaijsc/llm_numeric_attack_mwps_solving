Let me know. #Calculus #FunctionalEquations #Student\n#### Other methods to solve this problem:\nLet\u2019s think of $f$ as a function from $\\mathbb{N}$ to $\\mathbb{N}$. By the definition of $f$, we have\n\\begin{align*}f(x) &= 1\\text{ for }1\\le x\\le 3,\\\\\nf(x) &= 8\\text{ for }4\\le x\\le 7.\\end{align*}\nFurthermore, since $f(x+1)>f(x)$ for $x=1,2,3$, we have\n\\begin{align*}\nf(f(1))+f(f(2))+\\cdots+f(f(8))+f(f(9)) &=1+4+1+8+5+2+9+6+3\\\\&=\\boxed{20}.\n\\end{align*}\nSuppose $a\\in\\mathbb{N}$ satisfies $$f(a+1)=f(a)+2\\le\\min\\{8,f(a+2)\\}$$ then we have $f(a+1)=8$ and $f(a+2)=1$. We also have $f(a+3)=8$, $f(a+4)=1$, and so on; that is, the powers of $f$ oscillate between $1$ and $8$. We then can see that $$f(f(1))+\\cdots+f(f(9))=\\boxed{20}.$$\nIt\u2019s easy to find that $$f(x)\\in\\{1,8\\}$$ when $x\\ge7$. At this point, we have to specify the function further in order to satisfy the condition $$f(x+1)=f(x)+2\\le\\min\\{8,f(x+2)\\}$$ hence, we see that $$f(x)=\\begin{cases}1\\text{ if }1\\le x\\le 3\\\\8\\text{ if }4\\le x\\le 6\\\\1\\text{ if }7\\le x\\le 9.\\end{cases}$$ and so $$f(f(1))+\\cdots+f(f(9))=\\boxed{20}.$$\nWe know $f(7",
        " We first note that $f(x)$ cycles through the values 8, 4, and 1 in the interval $[1,3]$, where it takes value $8$ on the interval $[1,2]$, $4$ on the interval $[2,3]$, and $1$ on the interval $[3,3]$. We also note that $f(x)$ repeats this sequence on each subsequent interval of length 3, with the interval starting from $x = 1$.  For example, the interval $[4,6]$ is cyclically equivalent to $[1,3]$, as are the intervals $[7,9]$ and $[10,12]$ etc.  Now let\u2019s make a guess about $f(f(1))$.  Since $1$ lies in the interval $[1,2]$, $f(1) = 8$.  And since $8$ lies in the interval $[4,6]$, $f(8) = 4$.  Therefore $f(f(1)) = f(4) = 1$.  Similarly for $f(f(2))$ we have $f(2) = 4$, and then $f(4) = 1$.  The formula creates a loop that steps around $f(x)$.  By the above calculation, we can see that $f(f(1)) = f(f(2)) = \\cdots = f(f(3)) = 1$, and $f(f(4)) = f(f(5)) = f(f(6)) = 4$, and $f(f(7)) = f(f(8)) = f(f(9)) = 8$.  So the answer is $8 + 8 + 4 + 8 + 8 = \\boxed{36}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 36. I hope it is correct.  Please let me know if you have any other questions.  I will keep on answering.  Thank you for your questions.  Long live AMHSE!  The number $$\\sum_{x=1}^{9}f(f(x))$$can be found using the information of the graph provided.

        " I) let's get the relation between $x$ and $f(x)$ first.\nSince the boxes range from 1 to 9 both left and right, we obtain that $$1\\le f(x)\\le9\\Rightarrow f^{-1}(1)=9,f^{-1}(2)=8,\\cdots,f^{-1}(9)=1.$$Then another idea might be to use points because f(x) is graphed. We first settle our information to report about each point: \\begin{align*}\nf(1)=8&\\Rightarrow f^{-1}(8)=1\\\\\nf(2)=4&\\Rightarrow f^{-1}(4)=2\\\\\nf(3)=1&\\Rightarrow f^{-1}(1)=3\\\\\nf(4)=8&\\Rightarrow f^{-1}(8)=4\\\\\nf(5)=5&\\Rightarrow f^{-1}(5)=5\\\\\nf(6)=2&\\Rightarrow f^{-1}(2)=6\\\\\nf(7)=9&\\Rightarrow f^{-1}(9)=7\\\\\nf(8)=6&\\Rightarrow f^{-1}(6)=8\\\\\nf(9)=3&\\Rightarrow f^{-1}(3)=9.\n\\end{align*}Now, I think f(f(x)) will tell us which boxes we should get. This tells that, for example, f(f(1)) will give f(f^{-1}(8)) which is basically just equal to the point it meets with 8 in the y-values. The same for every single f(f(x)) and it can be compiled into$f(f(1))=5,f(f(2))=4,f(f(3))=9,f(f(4))=6,f(f(5))=\\cdots$\nSo the whole answer will be \n\\begin{align*}\nf(f(1))+f(f(2))+f(f(3))+\\cdots+f(f(9)) &= 5+4+9+6+\\cdots+2\\\\\n&=5+4+9+6+3\\\\\n&=27\n\\end{align*}Use the function I mentioned from start to support the given question = solution is 27.

I hope it is correct.\nSolution 2: We note that by graph analysis that the points $(1, 8),$ $(2, 4),$ and $(3, 1)$ are not touched by any line, and that exactly one point in between them is touched. These points are the points on coordinates $(1, x)$ where $f(x) = 1, 4,$ and $8$. The gap between $1$ and $2$ is the same length as the gap between $2$ and $4$ as well as $4$ and $8$, so to obtain a height of $5$, $x$ would be in interval $(2,4),$ thus our coordinates become $f(4) = f(4) = ",
        " \nThe function $f(x)$ jumps to the right by $7$ when its input goes from $1$ to $2$, so $f(2)$ is at position $8$.  Since the function $f(x)$ jumps to the right by $5$ when its input goes from $2$ to $3$, $f(f(2))$ is at position $13$.  Since $f(3)$ is at position $1$, $f(f(f(3)))$ is at position $8$.  Continuing that pattern, we see that $f(f(f(1)))$ is at position $1$, $f(f(f(2)))$ is at position $8$, $f(f(f(3)))$ is at position $13$, etc.\nTherefore, we can express the answer, $f(f(1))+f(f(2))+f(f(3))+\\cdots+f(f(8))+f(f(9))$, as $1+8+13+2+9+6+3+10+7+5+2+1+8+5+3+2=\\boxed{81}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 81.

For example, if you have a point as $y$, it becomes $x$. That\u2019s just the way graphs work!\nFor the first leg, we can easily tell that it starts at $f(1)=8$. Now, we just need to find out where the graph crosses that $y$-value. Now, look where $y=8$; it starts at $x=4$. Then, we know that $f(4)=8$.\nFor the second leg, we see that it starts at $f(2)=4$. Now, we just need to find out where the graph crosses that $y$-value. Now, look where $y=4$; it starts at $x=5$. Then, we know that $f(5)=4$.\nFor the third leg, we see that it starts at $f(3)=1$. Now, we just need to find out where the graph crosses that $y$-value. Now, look where $y=1$; it starts at $x=9$. Then, we know that $f(9)=1$.\nNow, we can deduce that $f(f(1))=f(8)=4$; $f(f(2))=f(4)=8$; $f(f(3))=f(1)=8$; $f(f(4))=f(8)=4$; $f(f(5))=f(4)=8$; $f(f(6))=f(2)=4$; $f(f",
        "  To start with we compute $f(x)$ in steps of 1.  We can do that using the graph.  We have that $f(1)=8, f(2)=4, f(3)=1, f(4)=8, f(5)=5, f(6)=2, f(7)=9, f(8)=6, f(9)=3$.  Now the pattern seems like an alike this, back and forth, so that every time you do $f(x)$, you would just be alternating left and right.  So those values are f(f(1))+f(f(2))+f(f(3))+f(f(4))+f(f(5))+f(f(6))+f(f(7))+f(f(8))+f(f(9))= 8+4+1+8+5+2+9+6+3=\\boxed{46}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 46. I hope it is correct.

We compute\n$$f(1)=2,\\quad f(f(1))=f(2)=5,\\quad f(f(2))=f(5)=3,$$$$f(f(3))=f(2)=5,\\quad f(f(4))=f(9)=8.$$So we can conclude that we can again use our original equation:\n$$f(f(1))+f(f(2))+f(f(3))+\\cdots+f(f(8))+f(f(9))=8+5+2+9+6+3+f(f(1))+f(f(2))+f(f(3))+f(f(4))=33+f(f(1))+f(f(2))+f(f(3))+f(f(4))$$Notice that this must be a sum of the form $33+f(f(1))+f(f(2))+f(f(3))+f(f(4))$.

        " First, we add some of these points on the graph together.
