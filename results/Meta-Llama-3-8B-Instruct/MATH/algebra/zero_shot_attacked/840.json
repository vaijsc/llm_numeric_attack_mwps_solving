Subtract the first equation from the second, so p = (282 - 128)/2 = 77. We can also find e = 128 - 3p = 128 - 77 = 51. The cost of a pencil is 128/3 - 51/5 = 8 - 10.",

        " This problem can be solved by setting up a system of linear equations: If $p$ represents the cost (in cents) of one pencil, then let $e$ be the cost (in cents) of one jumbo eraser.

Then, the cost of 3 pencils is $3c$ and the cost of a jumbo eraser is $28-3c$.\nWe know that $3c + 28-3c = 128$, and so $28 = 128$.  We also know that $5c +28 - 5c = 282$, and so $28 = 282$.  Both equations can be used to write an equation for $c$, which we find by subtracting $28$ from both sides of each equation and dividing by $1$: $c=\\boxed{4}$ cents.\n### Code:\n```python\nx = 128\ny = 282\nz = 28\nc = (y - z) / 2\nprint(c)\n```",
        " Solution\nThe three pencils and a jumbo eraser cost$\\$1.28$. So the cost of three pencils is $\\$1.28 \u2013$ the cost of the eraser. We can call the cost of an eraser $e$in dollars. Then, three pencils cost $3p - e,$where$p$is the cost of a pencil in dollars. Simplifying, we find that $3p-e=1.28.$  Similarly, five pencils and a jumbo eraser cost$\\$2.82.$ So the cost of five pencils is $\\$2.82 \u2013$the cost of the eraser. So five pencils cost $5p - e,$ where$p$is the cost of a pencil in dollars. Simplifying, we find that $5p-e = 2.82.$  We have two equations: \\begin{align*} 3p - e &=1.28, \\\\ 5p - e &=2.82. \\end{align*}  We can solve this system for$p$by subtracting the first equation from the second equation, giving us \\begin{align*} 2p &= 2.54, \\\\ p&= 1.27. \\end{align*}  To get the answer in cents, we multiply this by 100, so$\\$1.27$.Cent.multiplying by 100$.",
        "  First, convert the $\\$1.28$and$\\$2.82$ to cents, which gives $128$cents and $282$cents, respectively. Let $x$ be the cost of each pencil. We can model the system of equations using two equations:  \\begin{align*}  3x+128&=282\\\\  5x+128&=2822 \\end{align*}We can simplify the equations to get \\begin{align*} 3x&=282-128=154\\\\ 5x&=2822-128=2694\\end{align*}Now, we can simplify both equations further to get \\begin{align*}x&=154/3\\\\ x&=2694/5\\end{align*} We can divide both sides of both equations by $x$. But we are looking for the cost of a single pencil, so we can simplify to get $$\\frac{154}{3}=\\frac{2694}{5}.$$Cross multiplying yields $$5(154)=3(2694)\\Rightarrow770=8073.$$Therefore, the equation is not valid (all values are integers except one), which means that the pencil is not worth $\\boxed{82}$ cents.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 82. I hope it is correct. ### Adding Extra Help\nMaybe you don't like the way I answer, so here's an extra helpful version.\nWe want to find out how many cents $1$ pencil costs (in just cents). Let's say that cost is $x$. Since we know that $3$ pencils and a jumbo eraser cost $128$ cents, we know that $3x + 128 = 282$. Now, remove the $128$ from both sides, so $3x = 282 - 128$. Simplify that, and you get $3x = 154$.\nNow, divide both sides by $3$, and you get $x = 154 \\div 3$. This is equal to $51.33$. This means the cost of $1$ pencil is $51.33$ cents.\nNow, check it by looking at the second problem. We know that $5$ pencils and a jumbo eraser cost $282$ cents. So, $5x + 128 = 2822$. Remove the $128$ from both sides, and you get $5x = 2822 - ",
        " First, let\u2019s define $x$ to be the cost per pencil and $e$ to be the cost of the jumbo eraser in cents.\nSecond, we can write out a system of equations using the cost information given in the problem:$3x+e=128\\qquad(1)$$5x+e=282\\qquad(2)$We will use the substitution method to solve this system of equations. Rearranging equation (1), we find $e=128-3x.$Substituting this into equation (2), we have$$5x+128-3x=282.$$Expanding and simplifying, we find $2x=154$, or $x=\\boxed{77}$. Hence, the cost of one pencil is 77 cents.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 77. I hope it is correct. can someone help me with the second part of this q. how can we find cost of",

        " First, we need to convert$\\$1.28$ and $\\$2.82$into cents. Since there are 100 cents in each dollar, we do$1280+282=1562$to get the total number of cents.$Now, we can set up an equation: 3p + 156 = 1562\\$, where$p$is the cost of the pencil, and$s$is the cost of the jumbo eraser.  We can also create another equation: 5p+s= 2820\\$. Simplifying the two equations gives 3p=1406$, so$ p=468\\$. However, we cannot choose 468 cents since a pencil 3 pencils cost 3p=3(468)=1404. Since the total price of three pencils and an eraser should be 1280, we know that an eraser costs 156-1280/3=104-424= -320 cents. As you can\u2019t get a negative amount with the quantities given, it seems there is something that went wrong. Let\u2019s do the other way: \\begin{align*} 1560&=5p+s\\\\ 5p&=1560-s\\\\ 3p&=1560-s\\\\ \\end{align*} We can create another equation: \\begin{align*} 1560&=5p+s\\\\ 3p&=1280\\\\ \\end{align*}.\nSolving, we get \\begin{align*} 3(1560-5p)&=1280\\\\ 3(1560-5p)&=1280\\\\ 3\\cdot 128&=5p\\\\ 4&=p. \\end{align*} Thus, the cost of each pencil is$\\boxed{\\$4 cents}$. Final Answer: The final answer is 4. I hope it is correct.  ## Another solution Without loss of generality, let the cost of a single pencil be$x$. The cost of three pencils is then$3x$, and the cost of five pencils is$5x$. We know that these costs, along with the cost of a jumbo eraser, add up to$1280$cents and$2820$cents, respectively.

        "  Let x denote the cost, in cents, of one pencil.  Then $3x + 128$ is the cost of three pencils and a jumbo eraser.  Similarly, $5x + 282$ is the cost of five pencils and a jumbo eraser.  Thus,\n$$3x + 128 = 1288 \\Rightarrow x = 120,$$and so the answer is $\\boxed{120\\text{ cents}}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 120 cents. I hope it is correct. Solving for x gives x = 120. Therefore, in cents, the cost of a pencil is$120. This makes sense since 3 pencils cost 360 cents, and 5 pencils cost 600 cents, so the cost of a single pencil is half the cost of 5 pencils minus the cost of a jumbo eraser, or 600 cents - 128 cents = 120 cents.\nWe will always research problems to understand the methods to solve them. The methods for solving equations and the unit conversions help me to develop my math skills. I am always open to any new questions and going to research to find out the solution.\n# DSI Problem 5.2\nA series of 4 numbers starts with 11. Find the sum of the numbers in the series.\nThe series is not specified in the question. However, we can analyze possible series with the starting number 11.\nWe have to find the sum of the series. Let the series be $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$.\nWe know that $a = 11$.\nSuppose the series is a arithmetic series. It means $b = a + d$.\n$d = 11$ and $b = 22$.\nSimilarly, $c = 33$ and $d = 44$.\nThe sum of the series is $= 11 + 22 + 33 + 44 = 110$.\nNow, we are required to find the sum of the series in cents. Therefore, we have to multiply the answer by 100.\nThe sum of the series in cents is $11000$.\n# DSI Problem 5.2\nSolution: Let the four numbers in the series be $x,x+d,x+2d,$ and $x+3d$. We know that $x = 11$. The sum of the series is $= 11 + (11+d) + (11 + 2",
        " \nLet $c$ denote the cost of a pencil. We have the system of equations:\n$$3c+f=128,$$$$5c+f=282.$$The diagonal term is $5c$, so we subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate the $f$ variable:**$$2c=154\\Rightarrow c=\\frac{154}{2}= 77.$$ Hence, the cost of a pencil is $77 \\ \\boxed{\\text{cents}}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 77. I hope it is correct.[](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php?title=User:12345678999&action=edit)[](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php?title=User:12345678999&action=edit) First, multiply the first equation by $-2$ to obtain\n$$-6c-2f=-256.$$Add this to the second equation to obtain\n\\begin{align*}\n-c+3f&=26\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 3f&=82+f\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 2f&=82\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad f&=82/2=\\boxed{41}.$$The cost of the three pencils is then $3c$ and the cost of the jumbo eraser is $82$, so the cost of the pencils and eraser together is $3c+82$.  The cost of five pencils and a jumbo eraser together is $5c+82$.  Subtracting $3c+82$ from $5c+82$ and simplifying, we see that $2c=100$, so $c=100/2=\\boxed{50}$.Therefore, the cost of the pencils is $3c=3\\cdot 50=\\boxed{150}$ cents. The cost of a pencil is $150/3=\\boxed{50}$ cents.\\\\ Final Answer: The final answer is 50. I hope it is correct.\\\\ The problem says that three pencils and a jumbo eraser cost $1.28$, which is 128 cents.  Therefore, the three pencils cost 128 - 41 = 87 cents.  This means that one pencil costs 87/3 = 29 cents, which is the final answer.\\\\ Final Answer: The final answer is 29. I hope it is correct.\\\\ I will solve it using variables\\\\ The equation for the first one is $$3c+",
