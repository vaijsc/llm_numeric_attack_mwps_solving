It's showing the value as 64 instead of the correct value which is 69.\n### Solution: \nYou can adjust the precision of the calculation by using a specific scaler or by round() function. Here is how it can be corrected. If the x takes any decimal value, then round() function might not give the correct answer, because 2x^2+3x+4 becomes more complex and can lead to loss of precision.
