        " We must find a point (x, y) that lies on the graph of y = f(-x). If we correspondingly form an equivalent point on the graph of y = f(x), we may use algebraic manipulation to find its location.

I hope it is correct.  (optional) Show Solution\n#### Alternate solution:\nWe are given that $y=f(x)$ has a point $(5,9)$. Then $f(5)=9$. \\begin{align*} f(-x)&=-f(x)\\\\ f(-5)&=-f(5)=-9 \\end{align*} The point $(-5,f(-5))$ has its $y$-coordinate as -9. Thus, the sum of coordinates is $-5+(-9)=\\boxed{-14}$. This is incorrect (as double checking with the original statement showed) because (5,9) is not necessarily on the graph of $y=f(-x)$.\n#### Wrong Alternative Solution\nInstead, we can just look at the point $(5,9)$. Since the point is on the graph of $y=f(x),$ that means $9=f(5).$ Now, we just need to change $x$ to $-x$; this is what $f(-x)$ does. So the point $(5,9)$ will become $(5\\rightarrow-5,9\\rightarrow?)$, which is denoted as $(-5,f(-5))$. We can use $9=f(5)$, replacing $5$ by $-5$. We can do this because if $y=f(x)$ is symmetric at $0$, replacing $5$ by $-5$, which is the same thing as $x\\rightarrow-x$ should also work. \\begin{align*} 9&=f(5)\\\\ -9&=f(-5) \\end{align*} Then the point that is going to be on the graph of $y=f(-x)$ is $(-5,-9)$. The sum of coordinates is $-5+(-9)=\\boxed{-14}$.\nSolution 3: Without algebra\nWe are given that the point $(5,9)$ is on the graph of $y=f(x)",

When we flip this line about the y-axis to graph y=f(-x), point (-5,9) is also on this line. This point is the point we are looking for.

        "\u00a0 Let us call the two points A and B.\n$\u00a0A(5,9) :\\\nWe know that the point A is on the graph of y = f(x)\nB( ) must be on the graph of y = f(-x). So we compare\u00a0the y-values.\nFor point A:\nf(x) = 9",
        " We can start by describing how the point $(5, 9)$ is related to the point where $x$ changes sign.\nWhen $x=5$, $f(x)=9$. Note that $f(-x)$ is going to flip the sign of $x$. So, we have $f(-5)=9$, which implies $f(-(-5))=f(5)$. So, if we find one point on $f(-x)$, it has the same $y$-value as the point on $f(x)$. So, this point is $(\\boxed{-5,9})$.\nLet\u2019s go back and plug the answers in. So, the sum of that point's coordinates is $-5 + 9 = \\boxed{4}$.",
        " \nWe have $(5,9)$ is on the graph of $y=f(x)$, which means $9=f(5)$. This implies, in particular, that the function $f$ is even, which is $f(-x)=f(x)$.\n### ",
        " If the point $(5,9)$ is on the graph of $y=f(x)$, then there is one point which must be on the graph of $y=f(-x)$. What is the sum of that point's coordinates?\nSo, $f(5) = 9$ is given, then $-f(-5) = 9$.\nHence the point on the graph of $y=f(-x)$ is $(-5,f(-5))$, therefore the sum of that point's coordinates is $\\boxed{-5 + f(-5)}$. But $f(-5) = 9$, since $f(x)$ is even, so we have that the sum of the point's coordinates is $\\boxed{-5 + 9 = 4}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 4. I hope it is correct.  [Note: This result is valid under the assumption that $f$ is an even function, i.e., $f(-x) = f(x)$ for all $x$.] Let\u2019s think step by step.\n### ",
        " \nIf $(5,9)$ is on the graph of $y=f(x)$, then for the point $(5,9)$, we can write\n$$9=f(5).$$If $(5,9)$ is on the graph, that means it\u2019s graphed, so we know for the value $x = 5$, $y$ has the value $9$.\nNow let\u2019s look at the $y=f(-x)$ graph from the $(5,9)$ point. If we move from $(5,9)$ to $(-5)$ in the $x$ direction, then $$y=f(-5)=f(5)=9.$$\nSo, the point above is also on $f(-x)$! This is crucial because now we know that for $x=-5$, $y=9$, so the sum of the coordinates is $\\boxed{-5 + 9 = 4}$.",
        " We know that at x = 5, y = 9 is a point on f(x). So if we replace x by -x, we get y as -(9) = -9\n### ",
        " To find  the point on the graph of $y=f(-x)$, we should look at the point on the graph of $y=f(x)$ that has $x$ -coordinates swapped. Therefore, we need to find a point where if we replace $x$ with $-x$, we get a point on the graph of $y=f(x)$.\n### Explanation:\nWe know that $\\boxed{(5,9)}$ is on the graph of $y=f(x)$. Therefore, if we replace $5$ with $-5$, we should get another point on the graph of $y=f(x)$. That is to say, $(\\boxed{-5,9})$ is on the graph of $y=f(x)$. Then, since the $x$-coordinates of $(5,9)$ and $(-5,9)$ are swapped, the sum of their coordinates is \\begin{align*} 5+9-5+9=\\boxed{18}. \\end{align*}\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 18. I hope it is correct.Indeed, whatever the point on $y=f(x)$, we will find a corresponding point on $y=f(-x)$ if we interchange its $x$- and $y$- coordinates. Depending on the given points in the exams, this approach\u2019s variants could be used, consisting of yielding a somewhat shifted/ inverted envelop structure. Its appearance would characterize changing details with changing points. I hope this could offer some circuitous basis for consideration, straightforwardly or complexly.\nAlternatively, one could deduce it based on reflected graph y = f (-x). The lower part would give \u201cinverse expression x = f (-y)\u201d. Each point in the former would give a \u201cfollower\u201d point exactly 180 deg shift clockwise in the second, considering an origin and its reflection. Surprisingly, shifting origins act oppositely; better \u2018extended corner top\u2019s orientation.\u201d",
        " The given point $(5,9)$ lies on the graph of $y = f(x)$.\nThis means that the function $f(x)$ satisfies the equation $f(5) = 9$.",
        " For $y=f(x)$, let $(x, y)=(5,9)$. Plugging these values into $y=f(x)$, we find $9=f(5)$. From here, we have\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\boxed{f(-x)=-f(x)}\n\\end{align*}\n### Condition:\nfor some $t$ in which $y=f(-x)=f(t)$.\n### Reason:\nWe have $f(-x)=-f(x)$, and given $(x, y)=(5,9)$.

        " \nIt helps to add the roots of $f(x)$ and $f(-x)$ to understand what we are looking for.\nWe have that $(5,9)$ is a point on the graph of $y=f(x)$, and so $f(5)=9$.\nNow we want one point that is on the graph of $y=f(-x)$. The point that must be on this graph is the reflection of $(5,9)$ in the $y$-axis.\nWe have that $(x,y)=(5,9)$, and so $(x,y)=(-(5,9))=(-5,9)$.

I hope it is correct.  ### Solution\nIf the point $(5,9)$ is on the graph of $y=f(x)$, then $f(5)=9$. We want a point that is on the graph of $y=f(-x)$. Since the point $(5,9)$ is the reflection of a point on the graph of $y=f(x)$ in the $y$-axis, we know the point that must be on the graph of $y=f(-x)$ is the reflection of $(5,9)$ in the $x$-axis, or $(5,-9)$. Therefore, the sum of the point's coordinates is $\\boxed{-5 + 9 = 4}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 4. I hope it is correct.  ### Solution\nWe are given that $(5,9)$ is on the graph of $y=f(x)$. Since it is on the graph, we know that $f(5)=9$. Now we want to find a point that is on the graph of $y=f(-x)$. We can see that the point on $y=f(x)$ can be thought of as a reflection of the point in $y=f(-x)$ in the $y$-axis. However, we are not going to reflect the point in the $y$-axis, but rather in the $x$-axis. Therefore, the point on $y=f"
