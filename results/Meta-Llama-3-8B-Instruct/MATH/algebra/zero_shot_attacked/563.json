Let\u2019s simplify it. $$(4^2)^x = \\left(4^{2x}\\right)$$ Now we have $$\\left(4^{2x}\\right) = 16$$ Your expression, which is $(4^2)^x$, is supposed to be equal to 16, and it is. It means that $4^{2x}$ must also be equal to 16. We can also say it this way; $$4^{2x} = 4^{4}$$ It means that 2x is equal to 4. We can get $x$ value by using logarithm as follows.\n$$2x = 4 \\Rightarrow x = 4/2 = 2$$$$4^{x} = 16 = 4^{2} \\Rightarrow x = \\log_{4}16 = \\boxed{2}$$\nSo, we have the solution to be $x = 2$.\nDownload our\u00a0 complimentary video course on logarithms and exponents.

        " 4^{2x}=256^\\frac{1}{2}\nWe want to find x, so we must manipulate the terms to isolate it.\nWe simplify both sides of the equation using the definition of exponents:\n$$4^{2x} = \\left(2^2\\right)^{2x} = 2^{4x}$$\n$$256^{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\left(2^8\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2^4$$\nThe equation then becomes:\n$$2^{4x} = 2^4$$\nWhen the bases are the same, the exponents must also be equal. Therefore, we equate the exponents:\n$$4x = 4$$\n$$x = \\boxed{1}$$\nSo, the solution is $x = 1$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 1.

        " \\begin{align*}4^{2x} &= 256^\\frac{1}{2}\\\\\n&= \\left(4^2\\right)^{3/2}\\\\\n&= 16^{3/2}\\\\\n&= 16^{1/2}^3\\\\\n&= \\left(4^{1/2}\\right)^3\\\\\n&= 2^3\\\\\n&= 8.\n\\end{align*}\nSo, the equation becomes $4^{2x}=8$, or $(2^2)^{2x}=2^3$, which implies $2x=3$, so $x=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\frac{3}{2}. I hope it is correct.",
        " \nWe have:\n$4^{2x} = 256^\\frac{1}{2}$\nTake the 2nd power of both sides and simplify\n$(4^{2x})^{2} = (256^\\frac{1}{2})^{2}$\n$4^{4x} = 256$\nTake the 4th root of both sides\n$(4^{4x})^{\\frac{1}{4}} = (256)^{\\frac{1}{4}}$\n$4^{x} = 2$\nSo, we got $x = \\boxed{\\log_4(2)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is x = \\log_4(2).
