        " First let us denote $B$ with the coordinates $(b_1, b_2)$. Since $M(2, -12)$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$,\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{a_1+b_1}{2}=2, \\qquad&\\frac{a_2+b_2}{2}=-12,\n\\end{align*}where $A(a_1, a_2)=(-2, 1)$.\nThe first equation gives $a_1+b_1=4$, and the second one gives $a_2+b_2=-24$. Now, from the first equation, we can express $a_1=4-b_1$. Plugging this into the second equation, we have $(4-b_1)+b_2=-24$, or $b_2=-28+b_1$. Hence, the coordinates of $B$ are $(4-b_1, -28+b_1)$. The sum of coordinates is given by $4-b_1-28+b_1=-24$, and thus the answer is $\\boxed{-24}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -24. I hope it is correct.",

        " Steps 1 and 2\nFirst, we know the coordinates of the midpoint and one of the endpoints. We can use the midpoint formula to get the other endpoint, which is point $B$.
