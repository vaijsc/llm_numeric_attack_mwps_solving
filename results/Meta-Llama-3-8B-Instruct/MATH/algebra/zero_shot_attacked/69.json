        " To express $x^2+6x+8$ in the form $a(x-h)^2+k$, we must have $x^2+6x+8=a(x-h)^2+k$. Comparing coefficients of the $x^2$ terms, we find that $a=1$.  The $x^2$ term can be expanded as $a(x-h)^2=a(x^2-2xh+h^2)$, so we have $$x^2+6x+8=x^2-2xh+h^2+6x+k.$$ This will be true provided that $-2xh+6x=(2h-6)x$ (the $x$ terms match), $h^2+k=8$ (the constant term matches), and that $x^2$ terms match. The $x$ terms match, so we can ignore them. If we subtract $8$ from both sides, the equation becomes $-2xh+6x+k-8=0$.  The $x^2$ terms must also match, so we have $x^2=-2xh+k-8$ (when simplified).  To ensure this equation holds, we know that $h^2+k=8$, and $-2xh+k-8=x^2+6x$.\nFrom $h^2+k=8$, we find $k=8-h^2$.  Plugging this into our other equation gives us $$-2xh+8-h^2-8=x^2+6x.$$ Since $x$ is in the polynomial $x^2+6x$, we can try to combine $x^2$ terms: all possible $x$ terms. -2xh+8-h^2-8=(x^2+6x)+x^2=-2xh+x^2+6x+8-h^2-8-h^2-8=-2xh+2x^2-(h^2+8). We can now set our equations equal: x^2+6x=-2xh+2x^2-(h^2+8). When we simplify this equation (by combining the x terms), we obtain h=-3. And the answer is: \\boxed{h=-3}.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is h=-3. I hope it is correct.",

        " First, we want to express $x^2 + 6x + 8$ in the form $a(x - h)^2 + k$. Therefore, let\u2019s write\n$$x^2 + 6x + 8 = a(x - h)^2 + k.$$Expanding the right hand side of this equation using the binomial formula, we obtain\n$$x^2 + 6x + 8 = a(x^2 - 2hx + h^2) + k.$$Now, we can use the condition that the two polynomials must be equal to set the coefficients of corresponding powers of $x$ equal to each other. (Recall that polynomials with different coefficients are equal if and only if all the coefficients are the same. In particular, the coefficient of $x^2$ on the left is equal to the coefficient of $x^2$ on the right, etc.) Doing this, we obtain a system of equations\n$$\\begin{cases}\na &= 1, \\\\\n-2ah &= 6, \\\\\nah^2 + k &= 8.\n\\end{cases}$$We can solve this system using elimination. First, we use the first and second equations to eliminate $a$, so that we get $-2h=6$, which gives $h=-3$. Substituting this into the third equation, we have $(-2)(-3)^2 + k = 8$, which gives $k = -8 + 18 = 10$. So, $a = 1$, $h = -3$, and $k = 10$. Putting these values back into $x^2 + 6x + 8 = a(x - h)^2 + k$, we have\n$$x^2 + 6x + 8 = (x - (-3))^2 + 10.$$Therefore, in the form $a(x - h)^2 + k$, $x^2 + 6x + 8$ is $x^2 - 6x + 9 + 10$, so that $h = \\boxed{-3}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -3.

        "  $$a(x-h)^2+k=a(x^2-2hx+h^2)+k=ax^2-2ahx+ah^2+k,$$ Since $x^2 + 6x + 8 = a(x - h)^2 + k,$ we can match the coefficients of $x^2$. Hence, $a = 1$.  Next, $$x^2 + 6x + 8 = (x^2-2hx+h^2)+k = x^2-2hx+ah^2+k$$ thus, $6 = -2h + ah^2$. Since $a=1$, then $$6=-2h+h^2,$$ solving which, we obtain $h = \\boxed{-2}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -2.

        " \nTo write $x^2 + 6x + 8$ in the form $a(x - h)^2 + k$, we need to find the correct values for $h$ and $k$. To do this, first we have to expand $a(x - h)^2 + k$. $(x-h)^2 = x^2 - 2hx + h^2$, and $a(x-h)^2+k=ax^2-2ahx+ah^2+k$. So, we can write $a(x-h)^2+k ax^2-2ahx+ah^2+k$. Now we have to equate the coefficients. $a = 1$, $-2ah=6$, and $ah^2 + k = 8$. We know that $a = 1$, so -2a = -2. Substitute $-2ah = -12$ in the equation $-2ah = 6$, and we get $h = 2$. Finally, we have to substitute $h$ in the third equation $ah^2 + k = 8$.\n### Source: \nThis question is from my textbook, a practice book for pre-calculus-high school math.\n### Tags: \nalgebra, pre-calculus, high school math \n### Level: \nhigh school, pre-calculus \n### Picker: \nalgebra, pre-calculus, high school math \n### Command: \n complexity=1 math=\"algebra\" level=\"high school/local university\" topics=\"algebra\"  keywords=\"pre-calculus\" tags=\"algebra, pre-calculus, high school math\"  support_math_types:\"equation\"  feedback=\"___xxxxxxxxxxx___\"  retyped=true  project=\"algebra\"  course=\"pre-calculus\" math_problems=\"algebra\" hints_type=\"complexity\"  runner_mp4=\"no\" support_math_types:\"equation\"  tonal_math=\u201c_https://encrypted.google.com/_\u201d?   ---lengthcontrol=36(URL encode as \"+\" to make lengths of 36 or less)text/url \n### URL:\nhttps://encrypted.google.com/ +-lengthcontrol=36\nhttps://encrypted.google.com/_ \n### Picker: \nalgebra, pre-calculus, high school math \n### Command: \n complexity=1 math=\"algebra\" level=\"high school/local university\" topics=\"algebra\"  keywords=\"pre-calculus\" tags=\"algebra, pre-calculus, high school math\"",

The coefficient of $x^2$ on the LHS is $a$. The coefficient of $x^2$ on the RHS is $1$. So, we can write $a=1$. Now, equate the coefficients of $x$. $$-2ah = 6$$ and equate the constant term. $$ah^2 + k = 8$$ So, we have $a=1$, which is already known. $$-2h = 6$$\n$-2h = 6$ $h = -3$\nAnd, $$1h^2 + k = 8$$\nNow substitute the value of $h$. $$1(-3)^2 + k = 8$$\n$$k = 8 - 1(-3)^2$$\n$$k = 8 - 9 = -1$$ So, the answer is $h = \\boxed{-3}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -3.

Good luck.\nThe question like this is indeed simple to solve. I will try to explain it step by step. We begin with the original quadratic expression, $$x^2 + 6x + 8.$$We want to rewrite it in the form $$a(x-h)^2+k.$$So we consider $$x^2 + 6x + 8,$$and think about how we can manipulate it to change it into what we want. We notice that $$x^2 + 6x = (x+3)^2 - 9.$$This gives us $$x^2 + 6x + 8 = (x+3)^2 -9 + 8 = (x+3)^2 + 7.$$So now, we are using the form we want, but to get the correct value of $$a$$, we need to multiply by a constant, $$a.$$In this case, $$a=1$$because we didn\u2019t multiply our original expression by any constant. Also, we get $$h=-3$$and $$k=7.$$Another explanation is that it is easy to get to the previous equation using completing the square. To complete the square, you can add and subtract a square. So take $$x^2 + 6x + 8$$and write it with the middle term in the first group as $$x^2 + (2x+3)^2-9 + 8,$$which reduces to $$(x+3)^2-7$$or $$(x+3)^2+7.$$These are all the same and give us the same solution as before. The constant $$(x",
        " To express $x^2 + 6x + 8$ in the form $a(x - h)^2 + k$, we have to complete the square from the expression $x^2 + 6x + 8$ and find the values of $a$, $h$, and $k$.\nStep 1: Use the formula $x^2 + 2ax + a^2 = (x + a)^2$ for completing the square from the expression $x^2 + 6x$.\nWe have $a = \\frac{6}{2} = 3$, so we can write $x^2 + 6x = (x + 3)^2 - 9$.\nThen, $x^2 + 6x + 8 = (x + 3)^2 - 9 + 8 = (x + 3)^2 - 1$.\nStep 2: Because $a$ is missing in the expression $x^2 + 6x + 8 = (x + 3)^2 - 1$, we can put it equal to $1$ and write $x^2 + 6x + 8 = (x + 3)^2 + (-1)$.\nComparing this expression with the standard form $a(x - h)^2 + k$, we can see that\n$$a = 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad h = -3.$$\nWe can write down the final expression of the given equation in the standard form.\n$$x^2 + 6x + 8 = (x - (-3))^2 + 1,$$where $h = \\boxed{-3}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -3.

Bye for now!  \nBox Keeping Track of the Pictures\nBox\nThe expression $$x^2+6x+8$$ is equal to\n$$a(x-h)^2+k.$$ Details of the Solution\nStep 1: Use the formula $$x^2+2ax+a^2=(x+a)^2$$ for completing the square from the expression $$x^2+6x$$.  We have $$a=\\frac{6}{2}=3,$$ so we can write $$x^2+6x=(x+3)^2-9",

        " \nWe will write $x^2 + 6x + 8$ in the form $a(x-h)^2 + k$. To do this, we will complete the square.\n\\begin{align*}x^2+6x+8&=a(x-h)^2+k\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x^2+6x+8&=a(x^2-2hx+h^2)+k\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x^2+6x+8&=ax^2-2ahx+ah^2+k\n\\end{align*}\nNow, we compare the coefficients of $x^2$ and $x$ to obtain the equations $a=1$ and $-2ah=6$. Solving the second equation for $h$, we find $h=-3$. Therefore, $\\boxed{h=-3}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -3. I hope it is correct.  We wrote x^2+6x+8 in the form a(x-h)^2+k, completing the square. We also solved for h, finding that h=-3 when comparing coefficients. If the answer we choose is -3, it means that solution 3 and solution 4 are right answers.\n#### Solution 3: We will find h.\n$$(x+h)^2=x^2+2hx+h^2=(x^2+6x+8)+(-8)+2hx+h^2\\Rightarrow(a(x-h)^2+k)=a(x^2+6x+8)$$. Then, $a(x-h)^2+k=a(x^2+6x+8)$. Since our equation is x^2+6x+8, k=8. Furthermore, by simplifying, we see that 2ah=6. Dividing each side by 2, we get ah=3. Since k=8, ah^2=9. We also know ah=3. Therefore, h=-3 and our final answer is -3. Final Answer: The final answer is -3. I hope it is correct.\n#### Solution 4: In order to solve this, we must determine whether or not x^2+6x+8 has a vertex. A quadratic equation in the form of (x-h)^2+k will always have a vertex. Therefore, since it was already given that the\nequation can be written in such a form, we can write $x",

        " \nTo begin with, we first want to rewrite the expression $x^2+6x+8$ as the right-hand side of the equation.  For the right-hand side, we have $a(x-h)^2+k$.  We want to make these two expressions equal.  First, we can see that $a$ multiplied by $k$ will give the constant term $8$, so $ak=8$.  Therefore, $a=\\frac{8}{k}$.  Next, we see that the $x^2$ term of the expression will be equal to $a(x-h)^2$.  We can use the binomial expansion to expand the right-hand side and see that it is equal to $ax^2-2ahx+a(h)^2$.  Equating these two expressions, we see that $ax^2=a(x-h)^2=ax^2-2ahx+a(h)^2$, so \\begin{align*}a(x-h)^2=ax^2-2ahx+a(h)^2&\\Rightarrow a(h)^2=-2ahx\\\\&\\Rightarrow h^2=-2ah\\\\&\\Rightarrow h=\\frac{-2a}{h}\\end{align*}Using this expression for $h$, we can substitute this value into the expression $ak=8$, which yields that $a(h)=\\frac{8}{h}$, which means that $h=\\boxed{-2}$.  We can verify that this answer is correct by substituting it into the expression $x^2+6x+8$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -2. I hope it is correct.bucket brain\n### Answer: \nIndeed!  We can verify that $h=-2$ works by plugging it into the expression.  We have $x^2 + 6x + 8 = a(x-(-2))^2 + 8 = a(x+2)^2 + 8 = ax^2 + 4ax + 4a + 8,$ so $a = \\frac{8}{4 + 4a + 8} = \\frac{1}{3}.$ Then we have $a(-2)^2 + 8 = \\frac{1}{3}(4) + 8 = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{8}{1} = 3,$ which means that indeed $x^2 + 6x + 8 = a(x",
