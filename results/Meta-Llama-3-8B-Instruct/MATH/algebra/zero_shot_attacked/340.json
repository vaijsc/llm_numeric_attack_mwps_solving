        " First, let\u2019s expand $(x^5-7x+10) \\cdot g(x)$. The degree of $x^5$ is $5$, the degree of $-7x$ is $1$, and the degree of $10$ is $0$. So, the degree of their product is $\\boxed{5}$.\n Out of the $x$ and $g(x)$, the $x$ term will also contribute a term with degree $5$. Combining like terms, we will most likely get a degree $5$ term also.

Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.  Best, Mathisato\nHere, we wrote $h(x) = (x^5-7x+10) \\cdot g(x)$, so the degree of $h(x)$ is the degree of $(x^5-7x+10)$ (the highest power of $x$ in $x^5-7x+10$) plus the degree of $g(x)$.  The highest power of $x$ in $x^5-7x+10$ is $5$, so we need to add the degree of $g(x)$ to $5$ for the degree of $h(x)$ to be $5$.  The only possible degree of $g(x)$ is $0$ (which is the degree of a constant polynomial), or $1, 2, 3, 4,$ or $5$.  Of these options, the degree of $g(x)$ can only be $5$ and still result in $h(x)$ being a degree $5$ polynomial, so $b=\\boxed{5}$.\n## CODE:\n```python\ndef main():\n    print(\"Let's think step by step.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe degree of h(x) is the same as the degree of x^5, which is 5.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the degree of g(x) must be 5 as well, so b = 5.\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 5.

        "  In general, if $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $n$, then there exist constants $a_{n-1}, a_{n-2}, \\ldots, a_0, a_{-1}, \\ldots, a_{-n+1}$ such that $$f(x) = a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + a_{n-2}x^{n-2} + \\cdots + a_1x + a_0$$ Now set $x=0$ to obtain $f(0) = a_0$.  Thus we can write the polynomial as $$f(x) = a_0 + ax + bx^2 + cx^3 + dx^4 + ex^5$$ And set $x = x_1$ to obtain $f(x) = a_0 + x_1 \\cdot a + x_1^2 \\cdot b + \\cdots + x_1^5 \\cdot e$ Now in our case we know $h(x) = a_0 + x \\cdot a + x^2 \\cdot b + \\cdots + x^5 \\cdot e$ Now let\u2019s look at what happens when $x = x_1$ $$h(x) = a_0 + x_1 \\cdot a + x_1^2 \\cdot b + \\cdots + x_1^5 \\cdot e$$ Also we know $$h(x) = (x^5-7x+10) \\cdot g(x)$$ Putting those together $$a_0 + x_1 \\cdot a + x_1^2 \\cdot b + \\cdots + x_1^5 \\cdot e = (x_1^5-7x_1+10) \\cdot g(x)$$ Now we can write $g(x)$ as a polynomial degree $b$ as $$g(x) = a_{b-1}x^{b-1} + \\cdots + a_0$$ Plugging that back in we get $$a_0 + x_1 \\cdot a + x_1^2 \\cdot b + \\cdots + x_1^5 \\cdot e = (x_1^5-7x_1+10) \\cdot (a_{b-1}x^{b-1} + \\cdots + a_0)$$ $$a_0 + x_1 \\cdot a",

        " Let's break it down into parts.\n Pentagon Formula\nWe know that $h(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $5$.  That is, $h(x)=ax^5+bx^4+cx^3+dx^2+ex+f$, for some numbers $a,b,c,d,e,f$.  We are given that\n$$\nh(x) = (x^5-7x+10) g(x).\n$$\nIt would be useful to compute the leading term of $h(x)$ by computing the leading term of $(x^5-7x+10) g(x)$.\n Sum Rule for Product\nSince $(x^5-7x+10) g(x)$ is the product of two polynomials, the leading term of $(x^5-7x+10) g(x)$ will be the product of the leading terms of each polynomial.  We can find these by looking at the leading terms of each polynomial individually.  The leading term of $x^5$ is $x^5$, and since there is no other term with degree greater than or equal to $5$, the entire polynomial has degree $5$.  Now for the polynomial $-7x + 10$.\nWe see that the leading term here is $-7x$, and there is no term with degree greater than or equal to $1$, so the polynomial has degree $1$.  The leading term of $g(x)$ is the leading term of $(x^5-7x+10) g(x)$.\n Product of Leading Terms\nTherefore, the leading term of $(x^5-7x+10) g(x)$ is the product of $x^5$ and the leading term of $g(x)$.  Since the leading term of $g(x)$ is not specified, we can describe it generically as $x^d$, where $d$ can be any positive integer.  (We know $d$ must be some positive integer because the leading term of $g(x)$ has some degree.)\nIt follows that the leading term of $(x^5-7x+10) g(x)$ is $x^{5+d}$, where $d$ is some positive integer.  Since we know that $h(x)$ has degree $5$, the leading term of $h(x)$ must be $x^5$, which is not the leading term of $(x^5-7x+10) g(x)$ if $d\\ne0",
        " Given that $h(x) = (x^5-7x+10) \\cdot g(x)$, since degree of $x^5-7x+10$ is $5$, we have degree of $g(x)$ is $5$, so $\\boxed{b=5}$.\n### Explanation:\nWe solve this problem by recognizing that multiplying every term in $x^5-7x+10$ by the polynomial $g(x)$ will result in increasing the degree of every polynomial term.  Thus, the degree of $h(x)$ is equal to the degree of the product of the two polynomial terms.  Since the degree of $x^5-7x+10$ is $5$, if we multiply every term by $g(x)$, this gives us the polynomial $x^5g(x)-7xg(x)+10g(x)$, whose degree is $5$ since the degree of each polynomial term is $5$.  Since this matches the degree of $h(x)$, the degree of $g(x)$ must also be $5$.  Therefore, $\\boxed{b=5}$.\n### Alternative Explanation (More detailed):\nLet\u2019s analyze the expression $h(x) = (x^5-7x+10) \\cdot g(x)$. Since $h(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 5, we know that $(x^5-7x+10) \\cdot g(x)$ must also be a polynomial of degree 5. Notice that when we multiply a term by a polynomial, we increase the degree of the term by the degree of the polynomial. So when we multiply $x^5-7x+10$ with $g(x)$, we increase the degree of every term by the degree of $g(x)$.\nThus, $(x^5-7x+10) \\cdot g(x)$ will have five polynomial terms: one of degree 10, three of degree 5, and one of degree 0. The degree 10 term is $x^{10}g(x)$, and the degree 0 term is just $10g(x)$. Since $x^5-7x+10$ is a quadratic polynomial ($x^2$ term is missing, but the coefficient of $x^3$ is infinite), the only possible terms of degree 5 are $x^5g(x)$ and $-7xg(x)$. Thus, we can write $(x^5-7x+",
        " We know that the degree of any polynomial is the highest exponent we see in that polynomial.  Therefore, the degree of $h(x)$ is the highest degree of any term in the product, namely $5$.  We also know that for this product, any degree greater than or equal to $5$ will come from the $x^5$ term, and the constant term will come from the $g(x)$ term.  Therefore, we have that the degree of $g(x)$ can be ANY integer from zero (constant) to $5$.  Since we are trying to find the value of $b$, we conclude that $\\boxed{b=5}$. Final Answer: The final answer is b=5. I hope it is correct.",
        " If $h(x) = (x^5-7x+10) \\cdot g(x),$ then the degree of $h(x)$ is the sum of the degrees of the polynomial $(x^5-7x+10)$ and $g(x).$  The degree of $(x^5-7x+10)$ is $5,$ and the degree of $g(x)$ is $b.$  Since the degree of $h(x)$ is $5,$ the sum of these two is $5,$ so $5+b=5\\Rightarrow \\boxed{b=0}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 0. I hope it is correct.",
        " We notice that if we substitute just $x^5$ in $h(x)$ and we see that the constant term is $0$.  That means because $x^5$ has a constant term of $1$, we must have that $g(x)$ must have a constant term of $-10$ because it is multiplied by $(x^5-7x+10)$.  For that reason, $g(x)$ must have a degree of at least $1$.  So, $b$ is at least $1$.\nNow we will consider what happens when we substitute $x^4$ in $h(x)$.  We have that $(x^5-7x+10) \\cdot g(x) = x^4g(x) + [-7g(x)]$ because when we substitute $x^4$ in $(x^5-7x+10)$, the term $x^5$ is eliminated and we have the term $-7x$.  When we multiply $x^4$ and $g(x)$, we will have another degree 4 term in $h(x)$.  So, we must have that there is a $x^4$ term in the product \\boxed{bx^4+...} when we multiply $(x^5-7x+10)$ and $g(x)$.\nUsing this same logic, we see that $x^3$, $x^2$, $x$, and $1$ are also multiplied by $g(x)$ and their degrees and constant terms are eliminated.  So, $g(x)$ must have degrees ranging from $0$ to $4$.  And so, $\\boxed{b=4}$.\nThis solution is complete.  Stay tuned for the next one! \n### Manager: \nHere is the next one.",

        " Recall that if a polynomial $P(x)$ is written as $f(x)\\cdot g(x)$, where $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are polynomials, then the degree of $P(x)$ is the product of the degrees of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$.  In this problem, we are given that the degree of $h(x)$ is $5$.  Therefore, the product of the degrees of $f(x) = x^5-7x+10$ and $g(x)$ must be equal to 5.  In particular, this tells us that the degree of $g(x)$ must be equal to 1.",
        " The first thing we notice is that we know this information: $h(x) = (x^5-7x+10) \\cdot g(x)$. Notice that the degree of a product of polynomials is equal to the sum of the degrees of each of the polynomials. So we can start by using that fact to figure out the degree of our polynomial $h(x)$. On the left side, we have $h(x)$ which has a degree of 5, plus some non-zero constant, and so its degree is fixed at 5. On the right side, we have $(x^5-7x+10)$ which has a degree of 5, and $g(x)$ which has a degree of $b$. Then, if we use the fact that the degree of a product of polynomials is equal to the sum of the degrees of each of the polynomials, we have:\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 5.

        " \nTo solve this question, we can observe that the polynomial $(x^5-7x+10)$ is a divisor of the polynomial $h(x)$.  Also, this divisor has degree 5.  Now, we must find the degree $b$ of the dividing polynomial $g(x)$.\nUsing the fact that the degree of the product of two polynomials is the sum of their degrees, we have that the degree of $h(x)$ equals the sum of the degrees of $x^5-7x+10$ and $g(x)$, namely $5+b$.

Therefore,\n\\begin{align*}\n5 + b &= 5 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad b &= \\boxed{0}\n\\end{align*}and so $g(x)$ is a constant polynomial of degree $0$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 0.

We know that the leading term of $h(x)$, on the other hand, is $Ax^{5+b}$ for some different constant $A$.

The highest power of x in h(x) is x^5, and the highest power of x in g(x) is x^{5-b}. If the highest power of x in g(x) is x^{5-b} then correspondingly degree of g(x) is 5-b.

        " To write the polynomial $h(x)$ as a product of two polynomials, we need $h(x)$ to have degree $b+5$.  Because $$h(x) = (x^5-7x+10) \\cdot g(x),$$the degree of $h(x)$ is the same as the degree of $(x^5-7x+10)$, which is $5$.  Therefore, the other polynomial $g(x)$ also has degree $5$, so $b = \\boxed{5}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 5. I hope it is correct. 5 out of 5 score imaginable.

        "For this problem, we have that $h$ has degree $5$, and $h(x) = (x^5-7x+10)\\cdot g(x).$  We know that $(x^5-7x+10)$ is a polynomial of degree 5, and $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $b$.  Multiplying two polynomials results in a polynomial whose degree is equal to the sum of the degrees of the polynomials being multiplied, so in this case the degree of the product $h(x)$ will be $5 + b$.  Since the degree of a polynomial cannot exceed 5, this means that $5 + b \\le 5$, or equivalently, $b \\le 0.$  Since we cannot have $b < 0$ (because degree is a nonnegative quantity), we must have that $b = \\boxed{0}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 0.

        " 1\nh(x) = (x^5 - 7x + 10)g(x)\nFirst, note that the given polynomial, $h(x)$, has degree $5$, since it is a polynomial times a polynomial. Since $h(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 5, $x^5$ must be a term in the polynomial $h(x).\n$\\boxed{\\text{Degree of h(x)}}$ = 5$$=\\boxed{\\text{Degre of x^5}}$$\nLet $g(x)$ be a polynomial of degree $b$. We want to find $b$. To find $b$, first we should find the degree of the polynomial $h(x)$. The degree is the highest power of $x$ in the polynomial.",
        " a)\nNote that $h(x)$ and $(x^5-7x+10)g(x)$ are polynomials.  They therefore both have to consist of terms of positive integer powers of $x$. Since both are quartic, each must have all powers of $x$ up to and including degree 5. (Curiously, both polynomials may contain terms of lower degree too, as seen at the beginning.)\nNow, their coefficients are constant combinations of the coefficients of  $x^i$ in the two expressions, because for any $i$ the degree of $x^i$ in both is the same. It means that if we denote the degree of $x^i$ in polynomial $(x^5-7x+10)g(x)$ as $b$, then $(x^5-7x+10)g(x)$ has the following: $$x^5:\\qquad (x^5-7x+10)g(x)=x^5g(x)$$ $$x^4:\\qquad (x^5-7x+10)g(x)=-7xg(x)$$ $$x^3:\\qquad (x^5-7x+10)g(x)=7g(x)$$ $$x^2:\\qquad (x^5-7x+10)g(x)=10g(x)$$ $$x:\\qquad (x^5-7x+10)g(x)$$ $$1:\\qquad (x^5-7x+10)g(x)$$ $$x^0:\\qquad (x^5-7x+10)g(x)$$ Then, we can see that $(x^5-7x+10)g(x)$ has 6 terms of degree, and then degree of $g(x)$ is $5$.\n### Corrected Stage: ### So, $b = \\boxed{5}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 5.
