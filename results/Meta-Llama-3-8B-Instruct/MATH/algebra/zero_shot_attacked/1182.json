        " #### Steps toward the solution:\nStep 1: Calculate the interest for the first year. Interest at year 1 = Principal* rate* time = 2300* 0.05*1 = 115 Step 2: Calculate the balance after 1 year. Balance at year 1 = Principal + interest = 2300 + 115 = 2415 Step 3: Calculate the interest for the second year. Interest at year 2 = Principal* rate* time = 2415* 0.05*1 = 120.75\n( Principal remains the same, as we are calculating interest for year 2) Step 4: Calculate the balance after 2 years. Balance at year 2 = Principal + interest = 2415 + 120.75 = 2535.75\nLet\u2019s now continue this process for 16 more years.\nStep 5: Calculate the interest for each year: (Year 3) Interest at year 3 = Principal* rate* time = 2535.75* 0.05*1 = 126.78\n( Principal remains the same, as we are calculating interest for year 3) Balance at year 3 = 2535.75 + 126.78 = 2662.53 Continue the process till 18 years, calculating interest for each year and adding it up. Amazingly, it does not matter how precise you calculate these interests; the solution will remain the same assuming no other money is added to the account. #### Solution in brief once the calculation has been done: At the age of 18, Frederick will have 4931.59. Note that 4931.59 is the sum of the principal (2300) and interest accumulated for 18 years. ### Explanation of solution: The given problem involves calculating the interest accumulated over a period of time using simple interest. The key to the solution is understanding the formula for simple interest and recognizing that the principal remains constant and only the interest changes each year.\nWe start by calculating the interest for the first year and then add it to the principal to find the balance after the first year. Then, we repeat this process for each year until we reach the desired age of 18.\nBy doing so, we capture the interest changes at the end of each year and accumulate it over the years. The final result gives us the total amount of money Frederick will have when he can collect it at the age of 18.",

I hope it is correct.  To give you a more detailed answer, we did something called compound interest. Another way to solve this problem would be to do it through division and multiplication. We could use the formula $I = Pr$ where $P$ is the number of times interest is applied before converting it to the money, $r$ is the interest rate and $P$ is the principal. Since $P$ is 1, we use$P = 1$. We also know that $I = 2300(edit)} where $I$ is the$ amount of money Peter can disburse. We also understand that $$P = I\\frac{1}{1+r}$$ Substituting it and replace of \\$ 2300 we will gain $P$. Finally we can $Pr value is segregated to convert it to 18th year.

Principal is \\ 2300, rate is 5% or 0.05, and time is 18 years. Therefore, The amount of money Frederick will have when he is 18 years old = Principal + Simple Interest. The amount of money Frederick will have when he is 18 years old = \\ 2300 + ( \\ 2300 * 0.05 * 18 ) = \\ 5300 We are using the formula I = P * R * T to find the simple interest and then adding it to the principal to get the amount of",

        " The first step is to figure out how much money will be in the account after $18$ years.  The principal in the account initially is $\\$2300$, so we can write that as an equation:\\begin{align*}\nP&=2300\n\\end{align*}To figure out how much money will be in the account after $18$ years, we know that the account has a principal of $\\$2300$and an annual interest rate of$5\\%$. Using the formula for simple interest, we can write the interest earned each year as a formula:\\begin{align*} I&=P\\cdot r\\cdot t,\\\\&=2300 \\cdot 0.05 \\cdot 1, \\end{align*}Simplifying the above equation, we obtain that the interest in each year is$115$ dollars.  Therefore, after18 years, the interest earned will be$18\\cdot 115=\\$2070$.  Thus, the amount in the account will be the initial principal of$2300$plus the interest earned, so we can write that as an equation:\\begin{align*} V&=P+I,\\\\ &=2300+2070,\\\\ &=\\boxed{\\$4370}.\\end{align*}Hence, Frederick will have$\\$4370$ when he can collect the money at the age of 18. Final Answer: The final answer is 4370. I hope it is correct.  If you want to adapt these instructions to other scenarios, their goal is to find the total amount in a money account after a specified amount of time, knowing the principal and rate of interest. In general, this can be found using the following steps.\nStep 1: Use the formula for simple interest to find the interest earned each year.\nStep 2: Determine the total interest earned over the specified time period, by multiplying the interest earned each year by the number of years.\nStep 3: Calculate the total amount in the account, by adding the principal to the total interest earned.",

Translate into math:  The gift of$\\$2300$is invested at a rate of 5%.The interest rate is 5% per annum. So, the interest is 5% of $\\$2300$for each year. Interest rate is calculated in percentage so 5% becomes 5/100=0.05.In 1 year, the amount becomes$2300(1+(0.05(x))), where x$years. 3. Use the formula: The interest for the first year is$\\$2300(0.05)=\\$115$. In the second year, the amount becomes$\\$2300(1+0.05)(1)=\\$2300(1.05)$. Since it is simple interest, we just add the interest for the second year to the interest of the first year. The new amount becomes$\\$2300(1.05)+\\$115=\\$2415$. In the third year, the amount becomes$\\$2415(1.05)=\\2512.25$. So, for the 3rd year, the interest is$\\$2512.25(0.05)=\\$125.61$. Note that 0.05 is 5%.\n4. Repeat the process: For the 4th year, the interest is $\\$2512.25(0.05)=\\$125.61$. The amount becomes$\\$2512.25(1.05)=\\$2626.14$. In the 4th year, the interest is$\\$2626.14(0.05)=\\$131.31$.

So, for $18$ years, we find $$\\underbrace{\\$2300+\\$115}_{\\text{total at the end of 1 year}}+\\underbrace{\\$115}_{\\text{interest earned in the second year}}+\\cdots+\\underbrace{\\$115}_{\\text{interest earned in the eighteenth year}}=\\$2300+(18)(115)=\\$2300+\\$2070=\\",
        "  We calculate the interest after each year and add it to the original amount.  The original amount in the account after 1 year is $2300+0.05\\cdot 2300=2300+115=\\$2415$. In the second year, we get interest on $\\$2415$instead of$\\$2300$ since it\u2019s interest on the new amount.  The new amount after the second year is $2415+0.05\\cdot2415=2415+120.75=\\$2535.75$, etc. This pattern goes on for 17 years.\nWe get the following: \\begin{align*}\n\\$2300&+0.05\\cdot 2300=\\$2415\\\\\n\\$2415&+0.05\\cdot2415=\\$2535.75\\\\\n\\$2535.75&+0.05\\cdot2535.75=\\$2657.37\\\\\n&\\ \\ \\vdots\\\\\n\\$3152.3665&+0.05\\cdot3152.3665=\\$3303.6853\\end{align*}Note that we rounded from $\\$3152.3665+\\$15.19175+0.05^17 \\cdot 2300$since we only need to know the result to 2 decimal places. The result, rounded to 2 decimal places, is$\\$3303.69$.  So Frederick will collect $\\$3303.69$ at the age of 18. Final Answer: The final answer is 3303.69. I hope it is correct.  ### In case you are curious: The first 10 years form$\\boxed{\\$2558.59}$while the last two years only form$\\boxed{\\$44.10}$.  In other words, nearly all the interest accrues in the last two years.  Mathcounts style hint: This solution only requires recognition of a compound interest solution, thus is ready for Mathcounts competition. Back to main page.
