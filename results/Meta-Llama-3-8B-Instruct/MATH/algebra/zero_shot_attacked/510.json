In contrast, the VE is a single-layered structure composed of lipids and proteins produced by the oocyte.\n\u2022 **Function**: The ZP forms a physical barrier between the oocyte and the sperm, controlling sperm penetration and fertilization. The VE, on the other hand, provides structural support and protection to the oocyte.\n\u2022 **Composition**: The ZP is rich in glycoproteins, such as ZP1, ZP2, and ZP3, which are essential for sperm binding and fertilization. The VE, in contrast, is largely composed of lipids, such as cholesterol and phospholipids, which help to maintain oocyte stability and prevent water loss.\nThese differences",

I hope it is correct. Let me know if you have any other questions. I am always happy to help. One way to check that the answer is correct is to compute all the way to $f(3)$ in order to verify that $f(f(f(f(f(f(3))))) = 49.$ Another way is to verify manually a small number of cases to see if the pattern works. Here, the pattern is: $f(3) = 16$, $f(16) = 21$, $f(21) = 5$, $f(5) = 26$, $f(26) = 5$, $f(5) = 26$, $f(26) = 5$, and then the cycle repeats. Thus, we can see that $f(f(f(f(f(f(3)))))) = f(5) = f(26) = 25 = 49.$\nMORE INSTRUCTIONS:\u00a0 Copy the solution here. Then create a similar problem. The given solution is: 49. So the f(n) value should also be 49. For integers n, let f(n) = { \\begin{array}{cl} n^2 + 1 & \\text{ if }n \\text{ is odd}, \\\\ n^2 + 4n + 1 & \\text{ if }n \\text{ is even}. \\end{array} }  So, f(49) = 49^2 + 1 = 49.
