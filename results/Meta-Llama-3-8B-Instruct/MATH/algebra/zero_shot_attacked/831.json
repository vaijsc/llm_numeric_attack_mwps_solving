        " Step-by-step analysis\n`\u229b` is not a standard arithmetic operation, but 4-bit-bitwise XOR operation (also known as the \"bitwise XOR\" or \"exclusive or\"). It is a binary operation that takes two equal-length binary vectors of the same length and performs a logical XOR operation on each bit.\n`4\u229b5` means we perform the XOR operation on two 4-bit binary vectors, `4` and `5`. Since `4` and `5` are not binary numbers, we convert them to binary: `4` in binary is `100`, and `5` in binary is `101`. Now we can perform the XOR operation:\n`100 \u229b 101 = 001`\nThe result is a 4-bit binary vector `001`.\nNow, we have to subtract `(5\u229b4)` from this result. Again, we need to convert `4` and `5` to binary: `4` in binary is `100`, and `5` in binary is `101`. The XOR operation yields:\n`101 \u229b 100 = 001`\nNow we can perform the subtraction:\n`001 - 001 = 000`\nThe final result is `000`, which in decimal is `0`.",
