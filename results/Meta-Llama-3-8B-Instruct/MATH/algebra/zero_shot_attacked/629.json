This is equivalent to solving $$A + 3 + 4 = 31$$ for $A$. We can solve for $A$ by subtracting 7 from both sides of the equation, giving us $$A = 31 - 7 = 24.$$ Therefore, we know that $A$ is equal to $\\boxed{24}$.  Final Answer: The final answer is 24.

        " If $A\\ \\spadesuit\\ B$ is defined as $A\\ \\spadesuit\\ B = A + B + 4$, then $31 = A\\ \\spadesuit\\ 3(A + 3 + 4) = A + 7$ . To get rid of A, subtract 7.\n### Answer: \\[  A = 31 - 7 = \\boxed{24}\\]\n### Why: $$ (A+3)+3+4=31 $$ They took the 31 and made it into an equation by grouping it.\n### Feedback: Your first response lacked clarity.
