        " The given terms of the sequence are 6, 16, 26, 36. We know that the common difference of an arithmetic sequence is the difference between any term and the previous term. So let us say that 6 + d = 16, 16 + d = 26, 26 + d = 36. Let\u2019s now look at each of these expressions and find d. So we have d = 16 - 6 = 10 d = 26 - 16 = 10. So we see that the common difference d in this case is 10. We are asked to find the 100th term. We need to made sure that we understand this: we are asked to find the dth term in this arithmetic sequence where d = 100.\n### Solution: Now that we know that the common difference is 10, we can easily find the 100th term. Let\u2019s say the 100th term of the sequence is x. Since we have a common difference of 10, the first term in this sequence (that is, the 1st term) is 6, and the 100th term is x, we have x - 10 + = 6. The difference between the 2nd term and the 1st term is 10. Therefore, the 2nd term is 10 more than the 1st. 10 more than the 1st term is 16. The difference between the 3rd term and the 2nd term is 10. 10 more than the 2nd term is 26. And so on. So let\u2019s find the 100th term. We know that the 1st term is 6, and the difference between any 2 terms is 10. So the 2nd term is 10 more than the 1st. 10 more than the 2nd is 16. 10 more than the 3rd is 26. And so on. We can continue with this process until we get to 16 + (d-1)*10 = x. So we have: x = 16 + (100-1)*10 We have 16 + 90*10 = 16 + 900 = 916. Therefore, the 100th term is 916.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 916. I hope it is correct.  BYJUS(+6) In this final answer $7 explanations satisfy your doubts,",

        " \nArithmetic Sequence:\nThe sequence is given as 6, 16, 26, 36, ... which increases by 10, 10, 10, 10, 10 each time. So, the pattern is obtained by adding 10 repeatedly to the starting term. \n100th term: \nFirst, we need to find the first term (starting term). The first term is 6. \nThen, we need to find the common difference. The common difference is 10. \nFinally, we use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: \nan = a1 + (n - 1) * d\nan is the 100th term. \na1 is the first term (starting term) 6. \nn is the number of terms 100. \nd is the common difference 10.\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\nan = 6 + (100 - 1) * 10\nan = 6 + (99) * 10\nan = 6 + 990\nan = 996",
        " \n1. We first need to find the common difference (d) in the sequence. We do this by subtracting the terms that are consecutive (adjacent) terms in the sequence:\n\t6 - 16 = -10, \n\t16 - 26 = -10, \n\t26 - 36 = -10. \n mening the common difference is -10 (or, alternatively, 10, it doesn\u2019t matter for this problem).\n2. We can then use the formula for 100th term of an arithmetic sequence: a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d.\n3. a_1 or the first term is 6, n is 100 (the 100th term).\n4. Substitute the values for a_1, n, and d:\na_100 = 6 + (100-1)(-10)\na_100 = 6 + 90(-10)\na_100 = 6 - 900\na_100 = -894.\nSo, the 100th term of the arithmetic sequence 6, 16, 26, 36, ... is -894.\n### Final Answer: \nThe final answer is -894. I hope it is correct.  [01:45 05/07/2021]",
        " What is the 100th term of the arithmetic sequence 6, 16, 26, 36, ...?\nAn arithmetic sequence is a sequence where each term is obtained by adding a fixed constant to the previous term. In this sequence, the fixed constant is 10.\nThe first term, a1, is 6. The second term, a2, is 16, which is 10 more than the first term. The general term, an, is given by:\nan = a1 + (n-1)d\nwhere d is the common difference, which is 10.\nWe are looking for the 100th term, which is a100. To get that, we can plug in n = 100 into the above equation:\na100 = a1 + (100-1)d\n= 6 + (99)(10)\n= 6 + 990\n= 996\nThe 100th term of the arithmetic sequence is 996. Despite its humble beginnings, this sequence shoots up to a whopping 996 in just 100 terms!",
        " \nLet\u2019s denote the first term of the sequence as $a=6$. The difference between consecutive terms is $a_n-a_{n-1}=10$. Therefore, this is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of $d=10$.\nTo find the 100th term, we can use the formula $a_{n}=a+(n-1)d$, where $n$ is the term number. In this case, $n=100$.\nThus, we can write $a_{100}=a+(100-1)10=6+90\\cdot10=956$.\nThe 100th term of the sequence is $\\boxed{956}$. ",
        " \nLet\u2019s calculate the 100th term of the arithmetic sequence 6, 16, 26, 36, ... as follows:\nWe first find the first term of the sequence which is 6. The second term is 16 which is the first term plus the common difference. So the common difference is 16 - 6 = 10.\nSince we know the first term, the common difference, and we want to find the 100th term, we use the formula for nth term of an arithmetic sequence: \na_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\nWe plug in the values for a_1 = 6, d = 10, and n = 100:\na_n = 6 + (100-1)10\na_n = 6 + 90 * 10\na_n = 6 + 900\na_n = 906\nSo the 100th term is 906.\n### Conclusion:\nThe 100th term of the arithmetic sequence 6, 16, 26, 36, ... is 906. Final Answer: The final answer is 906. I hope it is correct.",
        " We know that each term of the arithmetic sequence is 10 more than the previous term. So, the difference between the terms is always the same, namely 10. We can give a general term like:\nNow, we know the first term as 6, then we find d as 10, and n as 100.\nSo the 100th term in the sequence will be: 6 + (100-1) * 10 = 6 + 990 = 996.\n Congratulations! You are correct. The 100th term of the arithmetic sequence 6, 16, 26, 36, ... is 996. Well done!\nThus, our answer is 996.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 996. I hope it is correct.### "
