The expression can be factored as $(x-1)(x-13)$, so the lowest possible value of the expression is when $x-1=0$ or $x-13=0$.

        " \nFor now, we assume that we don\u2019t have any constraint that the quadratic expression is smaller. Moreover, we are told that $x$ is an integer.

        " First, we need to realize that we are asked to find the smallest value.  To do this, we first need to find the roots of the expression.

If the expression doesn\u2019t have any integer roots, and we are asked to find the smallest value, that means that the smallest value will be when $x$ is an integer farthest away from those imaginary roots.\nLet\u2019s pick some integers. $x=-1$, $x=0$, and $x=1$ all aren\u2019t that good. However, $x=3$ looks good. This is because $x=3$ is farthest away from the imaginary roots, so this should give us the smallest value.\nFinally, let\u2019s think about plugging in $x=3$.

I hope it is correct.  Note that we can also find the answer using the fact that $a^2+2ab+b^2=(a+b)^2$ and completing the square.

Thus, we can obtain $$f'(x)=2x\u22126,$$ and set it equal to zero to find that $x=3,$ so, the minimum value is obtained at $x=3$ and $$f(3)=3^2\u22126\\cdot3+13=4.$$ Final Answer: The final answer is 4.

We can find its minimum value by completing the square. In this case, we can complete the square further by using the factored form of the expression.\n$x^{2} - 6x + 13 = (x - 1)(x - 13)$.\nHere, we know that $x$ is an integer, and the smallest possible value of $x$ is when $x - 1 = 1$ and $x - 13$ is 13.

Then, the value of the function at that point is $3^2-6(3)+13=9-18+13=\\boxed{4}$. Alternatively, you could use the quadratic formula if you prefer: \\begin{align*} r &= \\frac{-(-6) \\pm \\sqrt{(-6)^2-4(1)(13)}}{2(1)}\\\\ &= \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{36-52}}{2}\\\\ &= \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{-16}}{2}\\\\ &= \\frac{6 \\pm 4i}{2}\\\\ &= 3 \\pm 2i. \\end{align*} If $r$ is real, then it must be $3$, and plugging it back in would also give $\\boxed{4}$.

        " Since $x$ is an integer, any possible value of $x^2 - 6x + 13$ is the value of $a^2 - 6a + 13$ for some nonnegative integer $a$. To find the smallest value for this expression, we can try a few values of $a$ to see if we can find the smallest possible value.\nFor $a = 1$, we have $a^2 - 6a + 13 = 1 - 6 + 13 = 8$. For $a = 2$, we have $a^2 - 6a + 13 = 4 - 12 + 13 = 5$. For $a = 3$, we have $a^2 - 6a + 13 = 9 - 18 + 13 = 4$. For $a = 4$, we have $a^2 - 6a + 13 = 16 - 24 + 13 = 5$. For $a = 5$, we have $a^2 - 6a + 13 = 25 - 30 + 13 = 8$. It is clear that the smallest possible value of $a^2 - 6a + 13$ occurs when $a = 3$, so the smallest value of $x^2 - 6x + 13$ is $\\boxed{4}$. Final Answer: The final answer is 4. I hope it is correct.",
        " $7$\nThat was a tough question. The given expression $$x^2 - 6x + 13$$ is a quadratic polynomial in $x$. The first step is to try to factor it. Unfortunately, the quadratic formula would suggest that there might be some hard to solve quadratic equation and we don\u2019t want that here. So we will just have to try a different way. I don\u2019t know how to find the general solution. So let\u2019s use a little computer search.\nMaybe there is an $x$ at the bottom that could make it a perfect square trinomial like $x^2+ax+b$ where $4a^2+4b=1\\Longrightarrow a^2=b$ and $b$ is an integer. Of course we will not find such a thing if we don\u2019t try some kind of a guess. The easiest guess is 1. And it works. 2 appears to be no good. 3 will actually work too. $7 \\Longrightarrow 1$ was the only option. So for 1 we have\n$$x^2 - 6x + 13 = (x-7)(x-1)$$ That works pretty good. Maybe it will work even better at the bottom. $$13 -(x-7)(x-1) = (x-7)(1-(x-1)) = (x-7)(0) = 7.$$ And 4 works. $$x^2 - 6x + 13 = (x-3)^2+4$$ So $x=2$ and $x=4$ So the smallest value we will find is $4^2-6(4)+13=7.$ If it were a KA in which we had to give more work, we are done. I think we are done, but let\u2019s exam a little more test the computer we should now know the answer, but just in case let\u2019s make sure. So i was not i had chosen 12 we were OK. Just because 12 was not not a optimal integer value does not mean our value cannot work. So we have 7 is the smallest value of the function and this is its smallest root. Even a random number can find it. 1. The smallest value of $x^2 - 6x + 13$ is $x=2$. So for each value of $x$, the value $x^2-6x+13$ is a single positive number. There is no",
        " Final Answer: The final answer is 4. I hope it is correct. Let\u2019s go step by step to find out the LHS of the equation. Let $x^2 - 6x + 13 = y$ .  \\begin{align*} y &= x^2 - 6x + 13 \\\\ &= x^2 - 5x -x + 13 \\\\ &= x(x - 5) -1(x - 5) + 13 \\\\ &= (x - 1)(x - 5) + 13 \\end{align*}\nWe want to find the smallest value and $13 + (-5)^2 = 13 + 25 = 38 \\neq (0)$ . But $13 + 1^2 = 14 \\neq 0$ . Hence, in the first step, we can set $x-1 = 0$ or $x = 1$ . Undeniably, $x^2 - 6x + 13 = (x - 1)(x - 5) + 13 > 0$ but there exists $x^2 - 6x + 13 = (x - 1)(x - 5) + 13 = (0)$ . The minimum value possible is when $x = 1$ and the minimum value of $x^2 - 6x + 13$ is $x^2 - 6x + 13 = 4$ . This answer is consistent with the previous one. Final Answer: The final answer is $4$.

I hope it is correct.  Let $f(x)=x^2-6x+13$, then $f'(x)=2x-6$. The roots of $f(x)$ are $3$ and $1$, and we know that the minimum of $f(x)$ is attained at the smaller root since it decreases as you move to the right. Therefore, the minimum of $f(x)$ is $f(1)=1^2-6(1)+13=\\boxed{3}.$\nWe could do more than one thing with the data we have to make a strong case for this answer. For example, we could notice that the graph of $y=x^2-6x+13$ is a curve which opens upward and thus attains a minimum sometime. Then, we could look for where the curve is lowest by looking for its $y$-intercept and yes, we found that $y=13$ when $x=0$ and $y=1$ when $x=1$. Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{3}$.",
