I think that it is possible to do it.\nWe can always add some constant to each side of the equation, so that r^2 will be the same as the original equation. So, let\u2019s try to complete the squares for both x and y. Adding 9 to each side will give: x^2 + 7x + 9 + y^2 + 8y = 9.\nThis is what is called the \u201ccompleting the square technique\u201d which is used in algebraic manipulations of quadratic expressions. In this case, the addition to the left-hand side involves adding a positive constant, which is used to complete a square and transform the original expression into one that has the form of a circle.\nNow, we need to combine the first two terms of the left-hand side by adding and subtracting 9 to get: (x + 7/2)^2 \u2013 (7/2)^2 + (y + 4)^2 \u2013 (4)^2 = 9.\nWe can now rewrite the equation further by combining like terms on the left-hand side: (x + 7/2)^2 + (y + 4)^2 = 25/4.\nNow, we are almost done because we can see that the equation is a circle centered at (-7/2, -4) with a radius of 5/2.\nThe sum of the coordinates of the center of the circle is (-7/2) + (-4) = -11/2.",

In this problem, they gave us the equation x^2+7x+y^2+8y=0, so we need to re-write this equation to get it in standard form.\nWe can complete the square to do this. For the x^2+7x part, the first step is to divide the 7 by 2 and square it, which is 36.5. This will give us x^2+7x+\\frac{36.5}{\\sqrt} because length times width is area. The next step is to subtract the 36.5 from both sides, which will isolate the x^2+7x part. The value left on the left side will be x^2+7x+36.5. But we can rewrite this as (x+\\frac{7}{2})^2 because we have a difference of two squares.\nSimilarly, for the y^2+8y part, the first step is to divide the 8 by 2 and square it, which is 16. This will give us y^2+8y+\\frac{16}{2} because length times width is area. The next step is to subtract the 16 from both sides, which will isolate the y^2+8y part. The value left on the left side will be y^2+8y+16. But we can rewrite this as (y+4)^2 because we have a difference of two squares.\nSo, we have (x+\\frac{7}{2})^2+(y+4)^2 which is what we want. If we set r^2 equal to this expression, we have r^2=(x+\\frac{7}{2})^2+(y+4)^2. From this, we can see that the x-coordinate of the center is -\\frac{7}{2} and the y-coordinate is -4.

So, we should have (x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = 0, because the circle have center in the origin. Now we calculate (h,k) by finding the factors of the expression x^2+7x+y^2+8y.   x^2+7x+y^2+8y=(x+7/2)^2-49/4+(y+4)^2-16=(x+7/2)^2+(y+4)^2-65.

This is the center of the circle. Therefore, the sum of the coordinates of the center of the circle is 0.  Final Answer: The final answer is 0. I hope it is correct.

        " We can rearrange the equation into the sum of the squares form (umway formula). x^2 + 7x + (y^2 + 8y) = 0 => (x + (7/2))^2 - 49/4 + (y + 4)^2 - 16 = 0 => (x + (7/2))^2 + (y + 4)^2 = 13 => (x + (7/2))^2 + (y + 4)^2 = r^2 => (x + (7/2))^2 + (y + 4)^2 = 13^2 => The definition of the circle includes (h, k) as the center. So (x, y) + (h, k) is the circle that we have. This is similar to the equation we have: (x + (7/2))^2 + (y + 4)^2 = 13^2. (x + (7/2))^2 + (y + 4)^2 = r^2. Then (x + (7/2))^2 + (y + 4)^2 = r^2 => (x, y) + ((7/2), 4) is the circle we have. Then the sum of the center coordinates is ((7/2) + 4) = 9/2. We have 9/2. So we have the sum of the center coordinates which is 9/2.$"
