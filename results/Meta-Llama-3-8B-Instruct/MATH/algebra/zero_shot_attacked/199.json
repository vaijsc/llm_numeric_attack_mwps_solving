I hope it is correct.  ### Explanation: \\begin{itemize} \\item Start by computing $g(x)=4$. Then, we can plug $g(x)$ into $f(x)$. So, we have: $f(g(x)) = 2(g(x)) + 1$. \\item Now, substitute $4$ for $g(x)$. So, $f(g(x)) = 2(4) + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9$. \\end{itemize} ### Note: You can also draw a diagram to understand how composite functions work by mapping the input value to the output value. This would illustrate how $f(g(x))$ is the output value from the function $f$ when it is given the output value from the function $g$. In this case, $f(g(x)) = f(4) = 9$. Composite functions like this will be used in later algebra topics, like functions and calculus. You can find many examples of how to work with composite functions in textbooks or online resources. ## Start here! Read the introduction to learn why composite functions are so important. Then, work through the examples and exercises to build your skills with composite functions. If you have any questions, ask on the Messages board or explore resources online for more help. Hint: Think about how you can express composite functions by using parentheses nesting. Once you have that, it's easy!

        " \nIn problems with functions, when composing functions we go in accordance with the order of operations. Here, we have only one function, which is $f(x)$, and we are asked to evaluate it at another function $g(x)$. So, we substitute into the function and follow the definition of the function. The function $g(x) = 4$ means that $x$ is a constant and equal to 4. When $x=4$, then $g(4)=4$, so $f(g(x))=f(4)$.\nNow, $f(x)=2x+1$, so $f(4)=2\\cdot 4+1=8+1=\\boxed{9}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 9. I hope it is correct.",
