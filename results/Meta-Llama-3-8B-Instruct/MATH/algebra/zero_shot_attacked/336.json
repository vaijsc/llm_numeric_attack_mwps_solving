        " The value of the sum a + b in the expression is 1/3a + b.\nIf the numerator of the first term is changed to 4, then the expression becomes 4/3a + b.\nThe value of the sum a + b is therefore 4/3a + b. I hope this is correct.\nObservation: This solution is incorrect. The value of a + b is always a + b, and this value does not change when the numerator of the first term is changed to 4. Therefore, the sum a + b remains the same as it was initially, which is 1/3a + b.\nThe correct response is that the value of the sum a + b is still 1/3a + b, even when the numerator of the first term is changed to 4.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 1/3a + b.

Then, we can do b by distributing the fraction to each term in b and then simplify.\n### Answer: 9/xy + 5/y.

To solve this, we follow the order of operations (PEMDAS) and evaluate each term separately. In this case, we have 2 times 3 plus 2 times 5. To perform the multiplication, we multiply each pair of numbers together, then add them together. The result of this calculation is 16, which is the initial value of the sum. After changing the 3 in the first term to 4, the equation equals 2 times 4 plus 2 times 5. By following the same order of operations, we get 18 as the new value of the sum. The difference between these two values is 2, which is the increase in the sum. Final Answer: The final answer is 2. I hope it is correct.",
        " a+b\nHere\u2019s a step-by-step solution:\n1. The given expression is a + b.\n2. The numerator of the first term is changed to 4. So, the expression becomes 4/1 + b.\n3.

The question asks for the value of the sum a + b. But, we are given an expression where a is replaced by 4. So, we cannot find the exact value of the sum.\n6. However, we can write the expression as 4 + b, which is the value of the sum if the numerator of the first term is changed to 4.\nTherefore, the value of the sum a + b if the numerator of the first term is changed to 4 is 4 + b.
