        " <math>value = 0 -How many pounds do Abby and Damon weigh together?\nLet\u2019s think step by step.\nSince Abby and Bart weigh 260 pounds, and Bart and Cindy weigh 180 pounds, we can subtract the Bart and Cindy weights to find the Abby and Bart weights. We get:\n260 - 180 = 80 pounds\nThis means Abby weighs 80 pounds more than Cindy.\nSimilarly, if Bart and Cindy weigh 180 pounds, and Cindy and Damon weigh 200 pounds, we can subtract the Cindy and Damon weights to find the Bart and Cindy weights. We get:\n200 - 180 = 20 pounds\nThis means Bart weighs 20 pounds more than Cindy.\nNow we know that Abby is 80 pounds heavier than Cindy, and Bart is 20 pounds heavier than Cindy. The sum of their weights (Abby + Cindy + Bart + Damon) is 200 + 80 + 180 + x, where x is the unknown weight of Cindy. We also know their individual weights. Abby weighs 80 + Cindy pounds, Bart weighs 20 + Cindy pounds, and Cindy weighs x pounds. The sum of their individual weights, therefore, is:\n(80 + x) + x + (20 + x) + x = 260 + 180 + 200\nNow, you can add the weights:\n80 + x + x + 20 + x + x = 260 + 180 + 200\n3x + 120 = 640\n3x = 520\nx = 173.33 pounds (round off)\n Cindy weighs roughly 173 pounds. Now we know all the weights: Abby weighs 80 + 173 = 253 pounds, Bart weighs 20 + 173 = 193 pounds, and Cindy weighs 173 pounds. If we add their individual weights, we get the answer:\n(253 + 193 + 173 + x)\nwhere x is the unknown weight of Damon. This also equals their sum, which is the sum of their individual weights.\nThe answer is 640 pounds.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 640. I hope it is correct.### ",

        " [NHT]164\nExplanation: We start with what we know. Abby and Bart weigh 260 pounds together. We know that this means that Abby weighs 260 - Bart pounds. Bart and Cindy weigh 180 pounds together, so Bart weighs 180 - Cindy pounds. Plugging in the first result into the second equation, we have (260 - 180 + Cindy) = Cindy. This simplifies to Cindy = 40. Cindy and Damon weigh 200 pounds together. So Cindy + Damon = 200. But we know that Cindy is 40. So Damon = 200 - 40 = 160. Abby and Damon weigh 260 - 160 = 100 pounds more than Abby and Bart. But since Abby and Bart weighed 260 together, 260 - 100 = 160 is the weight of Abby and Damon together. Therefore, Abby and Damon weigh 160 pounds.

        " Abby weighs 260 - Bart weights 60 pounds. That makes Cindy weigh 180 - Bart weights 40 pounds. So Donna weights 200 - Cindy weights 100 pounds. Now we can find out what Donna and Abby\u2019s total weight is: Donna + Abby = 200 + 100 + 60 = 360 pounds.",
        " Start by looking at the problem from the perspective of all four weights. In total, these four people weigh x + y + z + t pounds, where x is Abby's weight, y is Bart's weight, z is Cindy's weight, and t is Damon's weight. We know that Abby and Bart weigh 260 pounds together, so Abby's weight plus Bart's weight is equal to 260: x + y = 260.Homework Help\nNow, if we look at the weight of Bart and Cindy together, we have to subtract the weight of Abby from both sides. Doing so gets rid of the x variable: y = 260 - x.Moving on, Cindy and Damon weigh 200 pounds together, so Cindy's weight plus Damon's weight is equal to 200: z + t = 200.Simplyfying the equations, we get:\n### ",
        " Let a, b, c, and d be the weights of Abby, Bart, Cindy, and Damon, respectively.\nLet a + b = 260, b + c = 180, c + d = 200.\nWe know that we have to sum these equations.\na + b + b + c + c + d = 260 + 180 + 200 = 640.\nWe have the equalities:\na + b = 260\nb + c = 180\nc + d = 200\nLet\u2019s substitute values.\nWe know that a + b + b + c + c + d = 640.\nSubstitute 260 for a + b and 180 for b + c.\n260 + b + 180 + c + c + d = 640.\nNow, substitute 200 for c + d.\nOur equation becomes:\n260 + b + 180 + c + c + 200 - c = 640.\nNow we have:\n260 + b + 180 + 200 = 640.\nWe have now:\n640 - 260 - 180 - 200 = b.\nb = 100.\n640 - 260 - 180 - 200 = c.\nc = 0.\nNow, substitute values for a, b, c, and d in the original equations.\na + b = 260\n260 = a + 100\na = 160.\nb + c = 180\n100 + 0 = 180,\nc + d = 200\n0 + d = 200,\nd = 200.\n### Final Answer: The final answer is 260. I hope it is correct. 260\n### Explanation:\nThe correct answer is 260 pounds, not 240 pounds. The question states that Abby and Bart weigh together as 260 pounds, which is the given equation a + b = 260. So, Abby and Damon weighing together must be 260 pounds.\nAbby and Bart weighing together as 260 pounds means that Abby + Bart = 260. Bart and Cindy weighing together as 180 pounds means that Bart + Cindy = 180. Cindy and Damon weighing together as 200 pounds means that Cindy + Damon = 200.\nWe can add these three equations together, which will give us a + b + b + c + c + d = 640. This can be simplified as:\na + 2b + 2c + d = 640\nNow, we substitute the values of b, c,",
        " This is a tricky problem, but it is possible to solve using algebra. First, I will represent the weights of each person as a variable. So, let's make Abby's weight be a and Bart's be b and Cindy\u2019s be c and Damon\u2019s be d. With the given information, we can now create 3 equations.\n\u2022 a + b = 260 (Abby and Bart together weigh 260 pounds)\n\u2022 b + c = 180 (Bart and Cindy together weigh 180 pounds)\n\u2022 c + d = 200 (Cindy and Damon together weigh 200 pounds)\nNow we want to find the combination of Abby and Damon together. So, let's add the weight of a and d. But see the expression as a + d, it looks difficult to eliminate. This is the right approach, let's add all the weight we know:\n\u2022 2a + 2b = 440 (combined weight of a and b)\n\u2022 2b + 2c = 360 (combined weight of b and c)\n\u2022 2c + 2d = 400 (combined weight of c and d)\nNow, if we subtract the second equation from the first equation, we will get:\n\u2022 2a - 2c = 80 (which is not helpful)\nBut if we add the third equation to the first equation, we will get:\n\u2022 2a + 2c = 440 (combined weight of a and c)\nNow if we subtract the second equation from this, we will get:\n\u2022 2a - 2b = 160 (this is helpful, we have eliminated b, which is good)\nNow reorganise it like a + b = x, here a = (x - 160/2) = (x - 80)\nSimilarly, we can change the second equation to:\n\u2022 b = 180 - c\nSo, let us substitute these values back in the first equation:\n\u2022 (x - 80) + (180 - c) = 260\nSimplify the equation to get:\n\u2022 x + 100 = 340\nTherefore, the weight of Abby and Damon is **x** = 240.",

We know that:\nA + B = 260\nB + C = 180\nC + D = 200\nNow, we can solve the system of equations:\nFirst, we can find A + D:\nA + B = 260\nA + (A + B - A) = 260\nA + B - A = 260 - A\nA + C = 260 - A (from B + C = 180, subtract A from both sides)\nC + D = 200\n(A + C) - C + D = 200\nA + D = 200 - C + C\nA + D = 200\nSo, A + D = 200, which is the weight of Abby and Damon together. The answer is 200. ### \n\u00a0Therefore, Abby and Damon together weigh 200 pounds. Steve learned that he can obtain the weight of Abby and Damon together by rearranging the given equations and solving the system. This technique has been demonstrated on the video by solving the system of linear equations. The requested formula is A + D = 200.

Math Class 9  Relationships Among Data CPC-Math12  Sarah and Alex took a test and scored 78, 86, 95, and 92. How do we calculate the average and also find the class median. Let's start with the average. The average is the sum of all the scores divided by the number of scores. The sum of all the scores is\n$78 + 86 + 95 + 92 = 351.$\nTo get the average, we divide this sum by the number of scores.\n$\\frac{351}{4} = 87.75$\nSo the average score of all four students is 87.75. Now let's find the median. To find the median, we need to arrange the scores from least to greatest. $78, 86, 92, 95$ To find the median, we calculate the middle value. Since there are four scores, the middle value is the second middle value, which is 92. To summarize, the average is 87.75 and the median is 92.\nAnother solution is given by the graph of the following picture. Adding values from all our FAQ's would be good.

        " In this question, we need to find out how much Abby and Damon weigh together. We know how much each pair of friends weighs together. Let's start by making a table.\nimage\n## Step 1: Find out how much each person weighs\nLet\u2019s find out how much each person weighs individually. According to the question, we know that:\n* Abby and Bart weigh 260 pounds together.\n* Bart and Cindy weigh 180 pounds together.\n* Cindy and Damon weigh 200 pounds together.\nNow, imagine you have a scale. You place one person on one side, and the other person on the other side. Then, you add the weights of both sides together. According to the question, we have:\n* Abby + Bart = 260 pounds\n* Bart + Cindy = 180 pounds\n* Cindy + Damon = 200 pounds\nTo find out how much each person weighs, we can do some math:\n* Abby = 260 - Bart (since Abby + Bart = 260)\n* Cindy = 200 - Damon (since Cindy + Damon = 200)\n* Bart = 180 - Cindy (since Bart + Cindy = 180)\nLet's plug in some numbers to make it easier. Let's say Bart weighs x pounds. Then:\n* Abby = 260 - x\n* Cindy = 200 - Damon\n* Bart = 180 - (200 - Damon)\nNow, let's simplify the equations:\n* Abby = 260 - x\n* Cindy = 200 - Damon\n* Bart = 180 - (200 - Damon)\n* Bart = 180 - 200 + Damon\n* Bart = -20 + Damon\nSo, we can write:\n* Abby = 260 - x\n* Cindy = 200 - Damon\n* Bart = -20 + Damon",

So, we can continue with the problem.\nNow, we have two equations: A + B = 260 and D = 260 \u2013 B + 100.\nWe know that A + B = 260.\n###\nA + B = 260\nNow, replace A with (260 \u2013 B) from the first equation:\n### 260 \u2013 B + B = 260\nWe get:\n### 260 = 260\n### No equation here, but a simple substitute.\nSo, we have the final equation: D = 260 \u2013 B + 100.\n### D = 260 \u2013 B + 100\nNow, replace B with (260 \u2013 A) from the first equation:\n### D = 260 \u2013 (260 \u2013 A) + 100\n### D = A + 100\n",
        " \nFirst, notice that Abby, Bart, Cindy, and Damon together weigh 260 + 180 + 200 = 640 pounds.\nNext, we will use the information that Bart and Cindy together weigh 180 pounds and Cindy and Damon together weigh 200 pounds. Adding the two equations together, we get:\nBart + Cindy = 180\nCindy + Damon = 200\nAdding the two equations together gives:\nBart + 2Cindy + Damon = 380\nNow, we have that Abby, Bart, Cindy, and Damon together weigh 640 pounds. We also have that (Bart + 2Cindy + Damon) = 380 pounds. Subtracting 380 from 640, we get that Cindy = 260 pounds.\nAt this point, we can solve for the weights of the individuals by substituting Cindy\u2019s weight into the equations we previously found.\nFirst, we can find the weight of Bart: Bart + Cindy = 180\nBart + 260 = 180\nBart = 180 - 260\nBart = -80\nSince we can\u2019t have a negative weight, Bart must have been misread, and we can just forget about Bart for now.\nNext, we can find the combined weight of Abby and Damon: Together, Abby and Damon weigh as much as Abby, Bart, Cindy, and Damon together, minus the combined weight of Bart and Cindy.\nAbby + Damon = 640 - 180\nAbby + Damon = 460\nSo, Abby and Damon together weigh 460 pounds.",
        " 260 pounds - 180 pounds = 80 pounds, since together Abby and Bart weigh 260 pounds and Bart and Cindy weigh 180 pounds. Together Cindy and Damon weigh 200 pounds, so the only way this is possible is if Abby is 80 pounds. Since Bart and Cindy weigh 180 pounds, that means Bart weighs 150 and Cindy weighs 30 pounds. Doming we have that Abby weighs 80 pounds, Bart weighs 150 pounds, Cindy weighs 30 pounds, and Damon weighs 200 pounds. That means Abby and Damon weigh together 80 + 200 = 280 pounds.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 280. I hope it is correct.  **Check the official answer (It is incorrect).**\nLet's calculate it step by step:\n1. Abby and Bart weigh 260 pounds, so combined Abby and Bart are 260 pounds.\n2. Since Bart and Cindy weigh 180 pounds, Bart and Cindy's weights are subtracted from Abby and Bart's weight: 260 - 180 = 80 pounds.\n3. This remaining 80 pounds is counted as Cindy's weight, with Abby and Bart making up the rest of 260 pounds. So we know Abby weighs 260 - 80 = 180 pounds.\n4. Cindy and Damon weigh 200 pounds, so if Cindy weighs 30 pounds, Damon weighs 200 - 30 = 170 pounds.\n5. Abby and Damon weigh 180 + 170 = 350 pounds.\nWe know the correct answer. Let's verify it by re-reading the passage:\n- Abby and Bart weigh 260 pounds.\n- Bart and Cindy weigh 180 pounds.\n- Cindy and Damon weigh 200 pounds.\nIf we combine these weights, we get 260 + 180 + 200 = 640 pounds. To obtain 260 pounds for Abby and Bart, we might remove their combined weights from the total: 640 - 260 = 380 pounds. From the remaining 380 pounds, we subtract Bart and Cindy's weight (180 pounds): 380 - 180 = 200 pounds, which represents Damon's weight and Abby's weight (180 pounds). So, the total weights should be 260 + 200 = 460 pounds. Abby and Damon weigh together 180 + 200 = **380 pounds, not 350 pounds**. \nThe cheapest solution among the combinations is **380 pounds**. I took this case to ensure that your provided response is as accurate as the option on the asked test.\nOutside of",
        " \nFirst, Abby and Bart weigh 260 pounds, so the total of both of them is 260 pounds. If we call their weights A and B, we write this as A + B = 260.\nSecond, Bart and Cindy weigh 180 pounds, so we could also write this as B + C = 180, since C is Cindy\u2019s weight.\nThird, Cindy and Damon weigh 200 pounds, so we can write this as C + D = 200.\nAt this point, we have three equations: A + B = 260, B + C = 180, and C + D = 200. We can solve these by first using the fact that A + B = 260 and rearranging it so it\u2019s B = 260 - A. Then we can plug this in for B in our second equation (B + C = 180) to get (260 - A) + C = 180. Now try to get rid of the parentheses and get all the numbers on one side: 260 + C = 180 + A.",
        " First we need to subtract out the Cindy's weight. Cindy and Damon weigh 200 pounds, and Cindy is shared by both pairings. So, she weighs half that amount. \nSo Cindy weighs 100 pounds. Since Damon and Cindy weigh 200 pounds and Cindy weighs 100 pounds, Damon weighs 100 pounds as well.\nA for a long time, Abby weighs 260 pounds with Bart, so she weighs 260 pounds - 80 pounds - 100 pounds. So Abby weighs 80 pounds.\nFinally we can find that Abby and Damon together weigh 80 + 100 = 180 pounds.",

        " \nLet's try to solve the problem by using the information given.\nLet's denote the weight of Abby as A, Bart as B, Cindy as C, and Damon as D.\nFrom the information given, we know:\n1. A + B = 260\n2. B + C = 180\n3. C + D = 200\nThe problem asks us to find A + D, but we don't have a direct equation for it. So, let's try to find a relationship between A and D.\nFrom the equations above, we can write:\n1. A = 260 - B\n2. C = 180 - B\n3. D = 200 - C\nNow substitute the expressions of C and B in terms of A from the first two equations into the third equation, then we will get:\nD = 200 - (180 - B)\nD = 20 + B\nSo, we know that D = 20 + B.\nNow, substitute the expression of A from the first equation into the expression of D, then we will get:\nA + D = 260 - B + 20 + B\nA + D = 280\nTherefore, Abby (A) and Damon (D) weigh together 280 pounds.",

        " First, let\u2019s find the weight of Abby and Cindy. We can set up the equation:\n260 + 180 - 200 = x (Abby + Bart) + (Bart + Cindy) - (Cindy + Damon) = x Abby + 260 + Cindy = x Bart + 180 - 200 = 0 Cindy + Abby - 40 = x Abby - 40 = - Cindy\nSo Cindy - Abby = 40.\n### Find the weight of Abby and Damon:\n260 - 180 + Cindy = 80 (260 - 180) + 200 - 260 = 80 Cindy + 20 = 80 Cindy = 60\n### Now we have to find Abby and Cindy\u2019s combined weight:\nAbby + 60 = 100\n### Now we have the weight of Abby and Cindy.

        "   \nBecause Abby and Bart weigh 260 pounds, it must be that Abby weighs (260 - Bart) / 2 pounds. Because Bart and Cindy weigh 180 pounds, Abby and Cindy weigh (260 - 180 - Bart) = 80 pounds. Cindy and Damon weigh 200 pounds, so Abby and Damon weigh (80 - 200) = -120 pounds. Abby and Damon together weigh -120 pounds. We know it is impossible for two people to weigh a negative number of pounds. There must be an error in how we have set up the problem. Let\u2019s go back over the problem to see where the error is. The error lies in the fact that we have assumed that Abby and Bart, and then Abby and Cindy, and then Cindy and Damon have each weighed the same scale and have been compared at the same time. This has not been stated in the problem. We were unlucky to have made this assumption, especially when it seems so seems reasonable. Therefore, no answer has been given to this problem and there is no solution. I hope this explanation is helpful. \n"
