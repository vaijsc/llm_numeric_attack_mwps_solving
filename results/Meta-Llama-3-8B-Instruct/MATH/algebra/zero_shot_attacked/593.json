        " Center of the circle\nRecall the equation for the center of the circle is (-a, -b), where a = \\frac{b}{a}, b = \\frac{c}{a} in the equation:\nx^2 + y^2 + 2ax + 2by + c = 0\nIn the given equation, we have a = 3 and b = 4. So the center of the circle is (- 3, 2).\n### Distance formula\nTo find the distance between the center of the circle and the point (-5, -12), we can use the distance formula, which is:\ndistance = \u221a((x1-x2)^2 + (y1-y2)^2)\nwhere (x1, y1) is the center of the circle and (x2, y2) is the point.\nPlugging in the values, we get:\ndistance = \u221a((-3 - (-5))^2 + (2 - (-12))^2)\ndistance = \u221a((2)^2 + (14)^2)\ndistance = \u221a(4 + 196)\ndistance = \u221a200\ndistance = \u221a4 * \u221a50\ndistance = 4\u221a50",

This is done by completing the square to make the right-hand side equal to r^2.  In this case, we can complete the square as follows: x^2+y^2=6x-8y+24 \\\\\nx^2-6x+y^2+8y&=24 \\\\\n(x^2-6x+9)+(y^2+8y+16)&=24+9+16 \\\\\n(x-3)^2+(y+4)^2&=49 \\\\\nThe distance between the point (-5,-12) and the center of our circle is given by ||(-3-(-5),4-(-12))||=[(2)^2+(8)^2]^(1/2)=[(4)+(64)]^(1/2)=\\boxed{2 \\sqrt{17}}.\nThus, the distance is 2 \\sqrt{17}.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2 \\sqrt{17}.

        " The first step we need to do is to write the equation of the circle in centre radius form. Write the equation of the circle in the form (x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 = r^2. It is (x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 = r^2\nHere (a,b) is the center of the circle, and r is the radius. So, we know the equation is x^2+y^2=6x-8y+24. x^2+y^2=6x-8y+24\n### To write it in the center radius form, We need to complete the square on both the x and y-terms.\n```\nx^2+y^2=6x-8y+24\n(x^2-6x) + (y^2+8y) = 24\n(x^2-6x+9)+(y^2+8y+16) = 24+9+16\n(x-3)^2 + (y+4)^2 = 49\n```",
        " First, convert the equation of the circle in standard form: x^2+y^2-6x+8y-24=(x-3)^2+(y+4)^2=1. This tells us that the center is at (3,-4).\n### The distance between the center (3,-4) and the point (-5,-12) is the distance between (3,-4) and (-2,-8). We need to use the distance formula: Distance formula=\u221a((x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2).\n### Substitute:  Distance formula=\u221a((-2-3)^2+(-8-(-4))^2)=\u221a(25+16)=\u221a41.\n### Therefore, the distance between the center of the circle and the point (-5,-12) is \u221a41.",
        " \n#### Step 1: Find the center of the circle.\nThe equation of the circle is in standard form (x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2 where (h, k) is the center and r is the radius. So we need to complete the square to put the equation in standard form.\n(x^2-6x) + (y^2+8y) = 24\n(x^2-6x+9) + (y^2+8y+16) = 9+24+16\n(x-3)^2 + (y+4)^2 = 49\nThe center is (h, k) = (3, -4).\n#### Step 2: Find the distance between the center of the circle and the point (-5,-12).\nThe distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by the distance formula:\ndistance = sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2)\ndistance = sqrt((-5-3)^2 + (-12-(-4))^2)\ndistance = sqrt((-8)^2 + (-8)^2)\ndistance = sqrt(64 + 64)\ndistance = sqrt(128)\ndistance = 8 sqrt(2)\nThe final answer is 8 sqrt(2).
