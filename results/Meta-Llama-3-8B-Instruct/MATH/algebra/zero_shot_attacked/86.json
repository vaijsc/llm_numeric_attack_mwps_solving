        " \nLet\u2019s start by writing $\\log_4$ as $\\frac{\\lg_4}{\\log_441}$ and evaluating. We get\n$$\\log_4=\\frac{\\log41}{\\log44}=\\frac{\\frac{1}{\\log_41}}{\\frac{2}{\\log_41}}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}.$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\frac{1}{2}. I hope it is correct.### Explanation:\nLet\u2019s think step by step.",
        " \nLet\u2019s break this down. $\\log_4$ of what number should be equal to... well, that\u2019s not given. It could be anything! So, let\u2019s just consider what we need a logarithm to equal, which is $x$.\nWe know that $x$ is equal to $\\log_4$.\n$$\nx=\\log_4\n$$\nNow, let\u2019s think about an important property of logarithms. If you have $\\log_b(x)$ and you multiply it by another base $b$, then it would give you $x$.\n$$\nx \\times b^{log_b(x)} = x\n$$\nNow, we substitute in what we know. \n$$\nx \\times 4^{\\log_4 x} = x\n$$\nNow, let\u2019s simplify the right-hand side.\n$$\nx \\times 4^{\\log_4 x} = x \\times 1\n$$\nAnd the right-hand side just simplifies to $x$!\n$$\nx \\times 4^{\\log_4 x} = x\n$$\nNow, since $x \\times 4^{\\log_4 x} = x$, then we can subtract $x$ from both sides.\n$$\nx \\times 4^{\\log_4 x} - x = 0\n$$\nAnd that simplifies to...\n$$\n4^{\\log_4 x} - 1 = 0\n$$\nNow, we can divide by $4^{\\log_4 x}$, then flip both sides.\n$$\n1 = 4^{\\log_4 x}\n$$\nAnd, that means...\n$$\n4^{\\log_4 x} = 1^{\\log_4 x}\n$$\nNow, we put it all together!\n$$\n4^{\\log_4 x} = 1\n$$\nFinally, we can just take $\\log_4$ of both sides to solve for $x$...\n$$\n\\log_4 \\left( 4^{\\log_4 x} \\right) = \\log_4 1\n$$\nAnd, simplifying...\n$$\n\\log_4 x = 0\n$$\nSo, $x$ is equal to...\n$$\n4^{\\log_4 1} = 1\n$$\nSo, the correct answer is $\\boxed{1}$! I hope this helps you understand $\\log_4$!",
        " \nLet's change the base from $4$ to $2$ by multiplying the argument by $\\log_2 4 = \\frac{\\log 4}{\\log 2}$. This is the same as multiplying by $2$, since $\\log_2 4 = \\log_2 2^2 = 2$.\nThen our new expression becomes $\\log_2 2 = \\boxed{1}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 1. I hope it is correct.odic programming. Using HERMES, you will be able to explore all scenarios! By the way, how many strategies would you like to simulate and how long would you like to run each session? You can specify this as you wish."
