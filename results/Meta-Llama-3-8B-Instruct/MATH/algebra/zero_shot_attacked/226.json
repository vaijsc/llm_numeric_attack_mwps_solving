        " \nThe way to solve this is to use the function definition with the condition given.\nWe have $f(x)=cx^3-9x+3$. Now we are given $f(5)=24$, which means we are considering the function value for $x=5$.\n$$f(5)=24=c(5)^3-9(5)+3$$\nBefore we calculate this, let\u2019s use the property of the vetex point:\nWe call the vertex of the function an equation in a normal form (parabola):\n$$y=ax^2+bx+c$$\nA parabola has the vertex when x is equal to -b/2a\nSubstitute that in the parabola and we get:\n$$y=a(-b/2a)^2+b(-b/2a)+c$$\nThis gives:\n$$y=ab^2/4a-ab/2+c=c-(b^2/4a)$$\nThe value of c at the vertex is at the line where c minus (b^2/4a)\nThis value gives us:\n$$y=-(b^2/4a)$$\nLet\u2019s get back to the problem. We need to find c.\nWe have $f(5)=24$ and so:\n$$24=c(5)^3-9(5)+3$$\n$$24=c(125)-45+3$$\n$$30=120c-42$$\nc=1/3 we got the value of c\n### Conclusion:\nHere we see that using the vertex point causes unnecessary complexity in fixing $c$  since the equations of the function does not require this. We just have to solve simultaneously both equations:\n$$f(5)=24$$\nAnd:\n$$y=ax^3+bx+c$$\nThen, we can solve with two equations and obtain.\nIn short, the answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\frac{1}{3}.

        " Let\u2019s calculate f(5) by putting x=5 into f(x).\nBy substituting 5 for x in f(x), we get:\n$$f(5)=c(5)^3-9(5)+3=125c-42.$$\n### ",
        " Let\u2019s use $f(5)=24$.  Plugging in 5 for $x$, we get $$c(5)^3-9(5)+3=24$$ or $$125c-45=24.$$ We can then solve for $c$ by adding 45 to both sides, then dividing both sides by 125 to get $$c=\\boxed{\\frac{69}{125}}.$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\frac{69}{125}.

        " Begin by identifying the equation $f(x) = cx^3-9x+3.$\n### Solution:  Beginning from there, we have\n$$24=f(5)=c(5)^3-9(5)+3=c(125)-45+3=125c-42,$$which we would want to solve for $c$. Hence\n$$125c=24+42=66\\Rightarrow c=\\boxed{\\frac{66}{125}}.$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 66/125. I hope it is correct.
