First, we simplified the equation by using the expo ^n property of exponents to group together like bases (A power). Then, we took the logarithm of both sides (ln) to get the equation 6x+3=13.

When x = 2 was plugged in, (2^{x+1})^3\\*8^x = (2^3)^3 \\* 8^2 = (8)^3 * 64 = 1024 * 64 = 65536, and dividing by 8192 yields 1.

Solve for x:\nSolve for x by subtracting 3 from both sides. x+3=13.\n### 5. Finally:\nFinally, subtract 3 from both sides again. x=\\boxed{10}.\nFinal Answer:",
        " First of all, the base of both exponentials should be the same to directly compare the powers. This is when\n$2^{x+1}=2^x$ which simplifies to $x+1=x$. As you know, the value of x that satisfies this condition is $x=0$.",
        " It can be observed from the equation that the base is removed when the bases are combined using exponents. \\begin{align*}\n\\left(2^{x+1}\\right)^{3} \\cdot 8^{x}\\\\\n=2^{3 \\cdot(x+1)} \\cdot 2^{3 x}\\\\\n=2^{3 x+3} \\cdot 2^{3 x}\\\\\n=2^{6 x+3}\\\\\n\\end{align*}Since base remains same on both the sides, \\begin{align*}\n2^{6 x+3} = 2^{13}\n\\end{align*}Thus, by comparing the exponents, we get the equation: \\begin{align*}\n6 x+3=13\n\\end{align*}Subtracting 3 on both sides, \\begin{align*}\n6 x=10\n\\end{align*}Dividing by 6, we get the solution $x=\\frac{10}{6}=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{3}}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\frac{5}{3}. I hope it is correct.###",
        " We can start with the left-hand side, which is equal to (2^{x+1})^3 * 8^x. If we can find a way to rewrite this into something that is more recognizable easier to work with, then we can proceed.\n(2^{x+1})^3 * 8^x = (2^(3x+3)) * (2^{3x}) = 2^(3x+3+3x) = 2^(6x+3)."
