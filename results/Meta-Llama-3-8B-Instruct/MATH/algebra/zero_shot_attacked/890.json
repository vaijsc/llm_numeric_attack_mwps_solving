        " x=16\nHere\u2019s my thinking:\nFor right now, I will denote the value of $\\sqrt{x+\\!\\sqrt{x+\\!\\sqrt{x+\\!\\sqrt{x+\\cdots}}}}$ as $y$.\nGiven this, we can see that $y=\\sqrt{x+y}$.\nSquaring both sides, we know that $y^2=x+y$.\nNow we can rearrange this expression to get $0=y^2-y-x$.\nFactoring the left side of this equation, we know that $(y-4)(y+1)=0$.\nGiven this, we can see that $y$ can equal $4$ or $-1$.\nBut remember that $y=\\sqrt{x+y}$; for this means that if $y=-1$, then we get the square root of a negative number, which is not possible.\nGiven this, we know that $y=4$, and so $\\sqrt{x+y}=\\sqrt{x+4}$.\nSquaring both sides, we know that $x+4=x+y$.\nGiven this, we can see that $x=16$.\n### Alternative Explanation:\nNotice that $x+\\!\\sqrt{x+\\!\\sqrt{x+\\!\\sqrt{x+\\cdots}}} = 4^2 = 16$.\nLet\u2019s call $y$ be equal to $4$. Then, substituting, we can see that $y = \\sqrt{x+y}$.\nThen, squaring both sides, we can see that $y^2 = x+y$. Factor $y^2-y-x=0$ and see that $y = 4$ and $y = -1$. The latter case gives a non real number. Thus, y = 4. We get $4=\\sqrt{x+y}$. Square both sides, and then get $x+y=16$, and $x=16$. Thus, $x=16$. ### Key Idea: The number inside the square root must be greater than or equal to 0. Because the expression inside the square root is inside a square root, it means the number inside the square root has to be greater than or equal to 0. This will ensure the square root is not imaginary. For a better comprehension, think of it this way. $\\sqrt{x+\\sqrt{x+\\sqrt{(\\cdots)}}}$ is an expression in a Kronecker chain ( an infinite or infinite alternating sum of square roots).

Next, we can subtract $a$ to both sides to get $a^2-x=0$. \n$$x=a^2$$Solving this quadratics by factoring.

The problem becomes a little easier.  Now, we\u2019ve still got a number under the radical, so we can take that number and put it under another radical.  In other words, if we take $x+\\!\\sqrt{x+\\!\\sqrt{x+\\!\\sqrt{x+\\cdots}}}$, we\u2019re essentially asking what happens when we add $x$ and that number under that radical.  As we just mentioned, that number equals $16$, so we get:\n\\begin{align*}\n \\sqrt{x+16}.\n\\end{align*}Now, this expression should look familiar.  We know that $\\sqrt{x+16}=4$, which simplifies to $x+16=16.$ Enter x Jord: x=0.  Final Answer: The final answer is 0. I hope it is correct.  I got this answer and everything after taking these steps and going back and forth to check for any other variables that might have been equally possible.\nHowever, I want you to come and check if everything is correct or not.  I know that there's this thing called proof, which I have not gone through because it was not required for this challenge.\nAnd, I didn't need to not put much more than this since I believe the procedure was clear and I was able to show all the work you requested.\nThat\u2019s my response.
