        " The bookstore wants to maximize its revenue. Revenue = (Number of books sold) x (Price per book). To maximize revenue, the bookstore can maximize either the number of books or the price of each book, but not both. Since the number of books sold is restricted to 100 - 2p, the bookstore can\u2019t sell too many books even if the price is very high. Therefore, let\u2019s maximize the price. Since 100 - 2p is independent of price, the number of books sold is also fixed and can\u2019t be influenced by price. Thus, the bookstore should set the price as high as possible. So, the bookstore will set p equal to its maximum value. To do this, set the number of books equal to 0:\n100 - 2p = 0\n2p = 100\np = 50\nSo, the bookstore will charge $50 to maximize revenue. The revenue generated by this pricing strategy will be $(100 - 2 x 50) x 50. Simplify:\n(100 - 50) x 50 = 50 x 50 = 2500.\n### Conclusion: The bookstore should charge $50 per book to maximize its revenue and generate \\$2500 revenue. Final Answer: The final answer is 50.

        " The revenue of the bookstore is given by the equation R = p(100 - 2p). To maximize the revenue, we need to find the value of p that minimizes the loss, or in other words, the value of p that makes the graph of R a maximum.\nWe know that p is a quadratic function, which means its graph is a parabola that opens either upwards or downwards. Since revenue is a positive quantity, we can be sure that the parabola opens upwards.",

        " The number of books sold is a linear function of the price so it\u2019s in the form f(p) = a*p + b. Given we know the function. To find the b, we need to do the following steps:\nStep1: Rewriting the function we are given, 100 - 2p, the function takes the form f(p) = a*p + b. So here we need to add 2p and put it on the left handside\nf(p) = 100 - 2p\nf(p) = 2p - 100\nStep2: This step is to see that a = 2 and b = -100. So now the function is in the correct form. Since now we know the function, we can set up the problem. Basically what we need to do is to maximize this function where the function is to find out how much money the bookstore can make.\nStep3: To solve this problem, we can substitute it into the function:\nf(p) = 2p + -100\nWe need to maximize revenue.

        " The question is asking for how much revenue the bookstore should make, given that they will sell 100-2p books. The revenue is just the number of books sold times the price they are sold at. The price is p. So the revenue is (100-2p)p = 100p-2p^2. Now we have to find the maximum value. We know the constant 100p will definitely be there, but the -2p^2 term can either increase or decrease the revenue. Since the bookstore wants the revenue to be the highest, we should make sure that the 2p^2 term has no effect on the revenue or worse, it gets bigger. So that means we should make sure that 2p^2 is as small as possible or even 0. That can already be done by using p = 0. But p = 0 would make them sell 100 books for free! Not a good deal.\nWe know the bookstore wants to sell the books for a higher price. So, we want to make p as big as possible. But, since p has to make sure that 2p^2 term gets big, p should not be too big. So, there should be a balance between p and 2p^2. The balance can be achieved by making the derivative equal to 0.\ndp/dp = d(100p-2p^2)/dp = 100-4p = 0\nNow, we can solve for p by setting p to 0. 100-4p = 0 would mean that p = 25. It looks like this maximum point will be a maximum. We can also graph this to confirm the answer.\nFinally, we find that the bookstore should charge 25 dollars per book to maximize the revenue.\nThe correct answer is 25.00.",

Taking the derivative of R with respect to p, we get: dR / dp = 100 - 4p. The maximum revenue occurs when this derivative is equal to zero. Equating it to zero, we get 100 - 4p = 0.

Then to get the revenue, setup the equation as follows:\n(R(p) = 0 ) implies ( 100p - p^2 = 0 )\nDivide the first term by 2, divide the second term by 2, and then rewrite the expression using the values p = 0 and p = 100.\n100p - p^2\nTherefore, we have the following equation:\n\\(\\,R(p)=100-p\\)\n\\(\\,003p-10p^2\\)\nwhich, after extracting the square, we obtain:\n\\(\\,003p-10p^2\\)\n\\(\\,003-002p\\)\n\\(\\,10-10p\\)\n\\(\\,10\\)\n\\(\\,10p\\)\n\\(\\,00220",
        "  Since the number of books sold per month is 100 - 2p, we want to maximize the revenue function in terms of p, which is Revenue (p) = (100-2p)p. To maximize this function, first, find the rate of change, that is, the derivative.\n### Solution:\nTo find the derivative of the function Revenue (p) = (100-2p)p, use the power rule of differentiation, which states that if f(x) = x^n, then f'(x) = nx^(n-1).\n\\begin{align}\nf(p) &= (100-2p)p\\\\\nf'(p) &= -2p - 2(100-2p)\\\\\n&= -2p - 200 + 4p\\\\\n&= 2p - 200\n\\end{align}\n### Maximizing the function:\nNow that we have the derivative, we can use the first derivative test to maxima the function. The first derivative test helps us find the critical points (where the rate of change equals zero) and determine whether those points correspond to a local maximum, minimum, or neither.\nSet f'(p) = 0 to find the critical point:\n\\begin{align}\n2p - 200 &= 0\\\\\n2p &= 200\\\\\np &= 100\n\\end{align}\n### Evaluate the second derivative:\nTo determine whether the critical point is a maximum, minimum, or neither, we need to evaluate the second derivative. The second derivative gives us the rate of change of the rate of change, often denoted as f''(p).\n\\begin{align}\nf''(p) &= 2 (since f'(p) = 2p-200 is a linear function)\n\\end{align}\nThe second derivative is always positive when the function reaches a local minimum. Since f''(p) = 2 is always positive, the critical point p = 100 corresponds to a local maximum.\nTherefore, to maximize the revenue, the bookstore should charge \\$100.",
        " We are given that \u201cthe number of books sold per month is 100 - 2p, where p is the price in dollars.\u201d That means we can formulate a function based on this equation.\nLet\u2019s denote the number of books sold as N and the price as p. Then N = 100 - 2p. So we can get the equation as below.\nN=100-2p\nWe are then asked to find out what price should the bookstore charge to maximize its revenue.\nThe revenue is calculated by multiplying the number of books sold by the price per unit. We can express this as R = N x p.\nSince we know that N = 100-2p, then N x p = (100-2p) * p = 100p - 2p^2\nSince the bookstore wants to maximize its revenue, we want to find the maximum value of the revenue function. To do this, we can find the first derivative and then set it to zero.\nBy doing so, we will get the value of p at which the revenue is maximized. In other words, we need to find the value of p that makes the derivative equal to zero.\nLet\u2019s differentiate the revenue function first. Then we have:\nR\u2019 = d(100p \u2013 2p^2)/dp = 100 \u2013 4p\nNow we need to set it to zero to find the value of p that makes the revenue maximized. So we have:\n100-4p=0\nBy solving this equation for p, we can get the value of p at which the revenue is maximized. So, 100-4p = 0;\np=25\nSo, the bookstore should charge $25 per book to maximize its revenue. 14 None ### ",
        "\nThe revenue equation is given by:\nR(p) = price * number of books\nR(p) = p * (100 - 2p)\nWe need to maximize revenue, so let\u2019s take the derivative of the revenue equation with respect to p:\ndR/dp = 100 - 4p\nSet the derivative equal to 0:\n100 - 4p = 0\nSolve for p:\np = 25\nSo the price should be 25 dollars to maximize revenue. Let\u2019s make sure we are correct by taking the second derivative and checking if it\u2019s negative. This will ensure that the revenue function is concave down, and the maximum is a global maximum.\nd\u00b2R/dp\u00b2 = -4\nSince the second derivative is negative, we know that the maximum is a global maximum. Now we are confident that the answer is correct.\nTo ensure that the price of 25 dollars makes sense, we can also check the number of books sold. At this price, the number of books sold would be:\nnumber of books = 100 - 2p\n= 100 - 2(25)\n= 50\nSo, the bookstore would sell 50 books per month at this price.\nAnswer is 25.\u618221\u9053\n...???### End of ",
        " The goal is to maximize revenue. The revenue function R(p) must be set up correctly.\n#### Calculate the revenue function\nRevenue per book = price per book = p\nNumber of books sold = 100 - 2p\nTotal revenue = price per book * number of books sold\nR(p) = (p)(100 - 2p) = 100p - 2p^2\n#### The revenue function is quadratic in form.\n#### To maximize it, find the vertex (turning point).\nThe vertex is located at the point (-b/2a), where a = -2 and b = 100. So, the vertex is at (-100/2(-2)) = p = 25/2 = 12.5.\n#### Check if the maximum can be approached from below or above.\nThe second derivative function is obtained by differentiating the revenue function twice:\nR'(p) = 100 - 4p --> R''(p) = -4\nThe second derivative is always -4, which means the graph opens downwards. This indicates that the maximum is approached from below.\n#### Since 100 - 2p is always \u2265 0, R(p) is defined for all real values of p.\n#### Since R(p) has a maximum, the bookstore charges $$\\boxed{12.50}$ per book to maximize its revenue if the number of books sold per month is 100 - 2p. \n(I hope this helps!
