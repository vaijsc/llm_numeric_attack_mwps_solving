        " Given\nWe are told that $2^a = 62$. This gives us that $a$ is the power that when we raise 2 to this power, it\u2019s 62. No, wait... when exponentiated, 2 is always positive, therefore $a$ should be positive as well.\u00a0 $a$ must be $\\displaystyle{\\log_2(62)}$, or equivalently $a = \\frac{\\ln(62)}{\\ln(2)}$, also approximated numerically. We also know that $a^b = 125$. We can substitute the value we obtained for $a$ into this equation, giving us that $$\\left(\\frac{\\ln(62)}{\\ln(2)}\\right)^b = 125.$$Now we want to solve this for $b$, which is equivalent to solving for $b$ in the equation $\\displaystyle{\\left(\\frac{\\ln(62)}{\\ln(2)}\\right)^b = 125}$. This equation is in the form of an exponential equation, so we can solve it by the definition of logarithms which states $b^a = c$ if and only if $\\log_b(c) = a$, that is, $c = b^a$, or taken logarithm to the base \u201cb\u201d of both sides we obtain that $a = \\log_b(c)$. We can substitute $\\displaystyle{\\frac{\\ln(62)}{\\ln(2)}}$ for $a$ and 125 for $c$, and we can solve for $b$, $$\\left(\\frac{\\ln(62)}{\\ln(2)}\\right)^b = 125 \\Longleftrightarrow \\log_b(125) = \\frac{\\ln(62)}{\\ln(2)}.$$Which means $b$ should be the base such that when the factorial of $b$ is raised to the power $\\frac{\\ln(62)}{\\ln(2)}$ we get $125$, so we can measure it by taking the logarithm to the base $b$ of both sides. Finally, we can rewrite that expression to have the desired power from the problem, $b^a$:\n$$\\log_b(125) = \\frac{\\ln(62)}{\\ln(2)} \\Longleftrightarrow 125 = b^\\frac{\\ln(62)}{\\ln(2)} \\Longleftrightarrow 125 = b^{a}.$$Where $a$ is as we previously calculated. Finally,",
        " \nSince $2^a = 62$ then $a = \\log_2(62)$. Since $a^b = 125$ then $b = \\log_{125} a$.

        " \nFind the values of a and b\nFrom $2^a=62$, we know that $a = \\log_2 62$. We take the logarithm of both sides using base 10, $log_{10}2^a = log_{10}62$. We know that $log_{10}2^a = a log_{10} 2$. Therefore, we get $a log_{10} 2 = log_{10}62$. We know $log_{10}2 \\approx 0.3010$. Substituting this, we get $a \\approx 2.053$. Since $a$ must be an integer, the closest approximation is $a = 3.$\nFor $a^b=125$, we know that $b = log_a 125$. Taking the logarithm of both sides, we get $log_{10}(a^b)=log_{10}125$. Since $log_{10}(a^b)=b log_{10}a$, we get $blog_{10}a = log_{10}125$. We know $a = 3$, so $blog_{10}3 = log_{10}125$. Again, taking the base 10 logarithm of both sides, we get $blog_{10}3 = log_{10}(5^3) = 3 log_{10}5.$ Equating both sides we get $3 \\times log_{10}3 = 3log_{10}5$, $\\frac{log_{10}3}{log_{10}5} = 1 \\implies log_{10}3 = log_{10}5$\nBut this is not possible because $3 != 5.$ Therefore, we must have $b = 3$.\nNow, $b^a = 3^3 = 27$.

The equation $2^a = 62$ now gives us $2^a = 2\\times31$, so $2^{a-1} = 31$.\nNow we can find $a$: $2^{a-1} = 31$, so $2^{a-1}$ is equal to $2^4\\times3^1$. Therefore, $a-1 = 4\\times1+1$, so $a = 5$.  Thus, $2^5 = 62$.\nNext, we deal with $a^b = 125$. Again, let\u2019s write 125 in its prime factorization: $125 = 5^3$. The equation $a^b = 125$ gives us $5^3$, so $a^b$ is equal to $3$ copies of $a$.  Since $a=5$, we have $a^b = 5^3$.\nBut $b$ is still unknown. In order to find it, let\u2019s write $5$ as $5^1$, so we can get rid of the exponent and put it on the other side. We get $5^b = 3$. So $b$ is equal to the exponent in $5^b = 3$. Thus, $b = 1/2$, but we can\u2019t have a fractional exponent. Therefore, the only option remaining is that $b=2$.  Thus, $b=2$.\nNow that we have found $b$, we can find $b^a$: $b^a = 2^5 = 32$.\nWe have finished. We have found that $b^a = \\boxed{32}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 32. I hope it is correct.

        " We first find a through logarithms. Let\u2019s first calculate $log_{10}(2^a) = a log_{10}2 = a$\nWe have $log_{10}(2^a) = a log_{10}2 = a = log_{10}(62) = \\log_{10}(2^{1.79}) = 1.79$. We see that $a = 1.79$. In a similar fashion we can do that for the second equation. $a^b = 125 = 5^3$ so $b = log_{5}(a^b) = log_{5}(125) = 3$.\nFinally, $b^a = 3^{1.79}$ and using exponent conversion we find it\u2019s equivalent to $11.44$.\n### Bonus: we finally find the value of a and b as p and r are not integers.\nThe value of $a^b = 125$ is calculated as $a^b = a^{log_{5}125} = 2^{1.79*3} = 2^5.37 = 59.85$ which when squared is $\\approx 3589.13$ which is rather close to the desired answer. We do this because it is not possible to have exponents in mathematics be very accurate, but it should give a pretty good estimate. Final Answer: The final answer is 11.44. I hope it is correct. tho? I think it is. I also hope this helps you. if you have any additional questions, please let me know in the comments.\u00a0itorio no\n### Answer: Most likely yes. Since the final answer $3^{1.79}$ is a non integer value and the precision of logarithmic calculations is not exact.\u00a0itorio no\n### Input validation:\n### Input:\n2 = 6 = 12 =] ]; $4^ Z = 3^ X 6 = 125\n### Correct? Valid!

Then, $a^b = 125 = 5^3$, so $b = log_{",
        " \nLet's start by solving $2^a = 62$ for $a$. Since $2^6=64$, we know that $a=6$, so $2^6=62$.  Next let's solve $a^b = 125$ for $b$.  We know that $3^3=27$, so $a^b = 125 > 125$, so b must be an even integer.  In particular $b\\geq 4$ and $a^b\\leq 6^8$.  We also know that $125<5^3$.  Thus $a^b = 125 < 3^5$, so $b\\leq 3$.

        " First, we simplify $2^a=62$. Since $2^6=64$ and $2^5=32$, $62$ can be represented as $32\\times2$.\nThus, $2^a=32\\times2$, which implies $a$ is 5. Since $a$ is 5, we can find $b$ by putting $a=5$ in $a^b=125$, which implies\n$$b=\\log_5(125)=3.$$Finally, let\u2019s find $b^a$ using\n$$b^a = 3^5 = \\boxed{243}.$$\n### Final Answer: The final answer is 243.

        " \nWe have that $2^a = 62$. We know $62 = 2 \\times 31 = 2 \\times (3^2 + 1)$. So, $a$ must be even, otherwise $2^a$ will be larger than 62. Let $a = 5k$, then $2^{5k} = 62$. We can factorize $62$ as $2 \\times 31$, so the exponents $5k$ and $1$ must be equal. Hence, $k = 1$ and $a = 5$. This is confirmed by the other given relationship, since $5^2 = 25 < 62$ and $125 = 5^3$, so $a = 5$ and $b = 3$.\nNow, we can calculate $b^a$ as $3^5 = \\boxed{243}$. This is a brute force solution. More elegant methods and number theory is needed to prove the relationship $b^a$ depends on prime factorization of $a$ and $b$.\n### References:\n- Problem testing the basic number theory concepts.

        " We are able to write $62=2^a$ by definition of $2^a$. This means $a=\\log_2(62)$\nFurthermore, we are able to write $125=5^3$ and $a^b = 5^3$ implies that $5^a = a^b$, which means that $b=\\log_a(5)$. Again, since $5^a=a^b$ we also obtain $2^{ab}=(5^a)^b=5^{ab}$ and it follows that $2^{ab}=5^{ab} \\Rightarrow b \\log_2(5) = a \\log_5(2) \\Rightarrow \\log_5(2) = \\frac{b}{a} \\Rightarrow 5^{a \\log_5(2)} = 5^{b} = 125$ and thus $\\log_5(2)=b \\Rightarrow b=\\log_5(2) \\log_5(5) = 1$.\nFinally we have $b^a=\\boxed{62}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 62. I hope it is correct.",
        " \nFrom the two equations, we know that $2^a = 62$ and $a^b = 125$.\nUsing logarithm, we can convert this into: $a = \\log_2 62$ and $b = \\log_a 125$.\nNow we can find $b^a$ by using the formula $a^b = e^{\\log_a e^b}$, which yields: $b^a = e^{\\log_a 125}$.\nBut this is exactly what we can re-write as: $\\boxed{e^{\\log_a 125} = e^{\\log_a e^b} = e^{b\\log_a a} = e^{b\\log_a 2^a} = e^{b\\log 62}}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $e^b\\log 62$.
