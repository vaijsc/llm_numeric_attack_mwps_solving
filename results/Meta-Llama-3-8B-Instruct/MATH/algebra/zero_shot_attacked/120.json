Let me try. First, we want to rewrite $$133$$ so it is a power of 4. We can do this by noticing that $$133=4\\cdot33.$$Here we can continue simplifying:$$4\\cdot (9\\cdot4+3)=144+12=4^2\\cdot9+4\\cdot 3.$$Here our goal is to notice that we have a pattern, we can keep doing this and eventually get the right number. We can use this pattern to notice that we can add one more power of 4: $$4^2\\cdot9+4\\cdot 3=4^3\\cdot\\frac{9}{16}+4\\cdot\\frac{12}{16}.$$Now we can add one more $$4$$ and continue: $$4^3\\cdot\\frac{9}{16}+4\\cdot\\frac{12}{16}+4^3\\cdot\\frac{3}{16}=4^4\\cdot\\frac{9}{256}+\\frac{60}{256}.$$",

        " Start\n$\\log_266.$\nThis is an inverse function. So we can get $x$ (the value), while given $b$ (the base) and $y$ (the argument) as follows: $x=\\log_by$ For our problem, we know $b=2,$ and $y=6.$\n### ",
        " We will begin by expressing the number 6.6 in terms of 2:$$6.6=2+2+1.6$$Then we will isolate the part of this number related to 2:$$2+2+1.6=4+1.6$$(1)\nNow, let consider three-term exponentiation: $$(2)^{4*1}=2^{4}$$Then let\u2019s consider the terms of the second direction: $$(2)^{2}=2.0$$One of these quantities can be written in terms of 1.6: $$1.6=1^{2*0.8}=1^{(2^{\\log_21*0.8})} = 1^{(2^{0.8})}$$ and$$2^{1*4}=2^{4}$$Here, the power corresponding to the terms of the second direction: 1.6 can be written in terms of the base 1: $$(2)^{4*1}=2^{4}=1^{(2^{2})}=1^{8}$$\n#### Final Answer:\nFinal Answer is 4.
