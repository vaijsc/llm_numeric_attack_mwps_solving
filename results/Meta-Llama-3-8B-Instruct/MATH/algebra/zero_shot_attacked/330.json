By difference of two squares we have\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\phantom{=}1102^2-502^2+298^2-202^2\\\\\n&=\\big((1102^2-502^2)+(298^2-202^2)\\big)\\\\\n&=(\\underbrace{(1100+2)^2-(500+2)^2}_{\\begin{array}{c}(2+100)^2\\\\-(2+500)^2\\end{array}}+\\underbrace{(300+2)^2-(200+2)^2}_{\\begin{array}{c}(2+300)^2\\\\-(2+200)^2\\end{array}})\\\\\n&=(100^2-500^2+600^2-400^2)\\quad\\text{by]+$0+2^2$}\\\\\n&=(100^2-\\big((500)^2-(400)^2\\big)+600^2)\\\\\n&=(100^2-(500^2-400^2)+600^2)\\\\\n&=(100^2-4000+400^2)+600^2)\\\\\n&=100^2-4000+400^2+600^2\\\\\n&=(100+400)^2-4000+400^2\\\\\n&=(500)^2-4000+400^2\\\\\n&=(500-40)^2\\\\\n&=\\boxed{244\\,000}.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 244,000. I hope it is correct.~~~\nPlease let me know in the comments if I got it wrong.\nEnjoy! Tips and tricks:\n- Introduce $n$ when things are still relatively simple.\n- Write expressions that you are familiar with.\n- Use the difference of two squares to break expressions up.\n- Simplify expressions by uncoupling individual terms.\n- Use mechanical steps to manipulate calculations. (e.g., invoke Pascal\u2019s triangle)\n- You might have seen some of these methods before in different settings.\n# source of this problem:\n    - This problem comes from AoPS (Art of Problem Solving, an online forum for math enthusiasts) and requires some quick thinking, experience with difference of squares, and a strategic approach. Strictly speaking, the solution above is just one approach",
        " Let\u2019s think step by step.\nWe have to show the common factor of first two terms and then subtract the common factor of last two terms.\nNow let\u2019s do: 1102^2-502^2 = (1102-502)(1102+502) = 600(1602) = 960,000.\nNext we have to show the common factor of first two terms. So now let\u2019s do: 960,000 - 298^2+202^2 = 960,000 - 298^2+202^2 = 960,000 - (298^2-202^2) = 960,000 - (298-202)(298+202) = 960,000 - 396(500) = 960,000 - 198,000 = 762,000.\nHence the final answer is 762,000.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 762,000.
