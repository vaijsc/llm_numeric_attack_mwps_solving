        " We have that $h(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{x+3}{2}}$. Now we need to find the value of $h(2)$. First of all we replace $x$ with $2$ in the given equation. We get $h(2) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2+3}{2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{5}{2}}$. Now we can simplify the numerator. $\\frac{5}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 5 = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 2 + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 3 = 1 + \\frac{3}{2}$. Therefore, $h(2) = \\sqrt{\\frac{5}{2}} = \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{3}{2}}$.\nNow we can use the binomial expansion to simplify the expression $\\sqrt{1 + \\frac{3}{2}}$. We know that $\\sqrt{a + b} = \\sqrt{a} \\cdot \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{b}{a}} = \\sqrt{a} \\cdot \\left(1 + \\frac{b}{2a} - \\frac{b^2}{8a^2} + O(1/16)\\right)$. In our case $a = 1$ and $b = \\frac{3}{2}$. We get $h(2) = \\sqrt{1} \\cdot \\left(1 + \\frac{\\frac{3}{2}}{2} - \\frac{\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2}{8} + O(1/16)\\right)$\nThe first two terms are not important for our solution, because if we consider $h(2)$ to be an approximate value, these terms will get cancelled with each other. Therefore, the simplification of $h(2)$ will be in terms of the squared value of the third term. This is $\\sqrt{1 + \\frac{3}{2}} = \\left(1 + \\frac{9}{8} + O(1/16)\\right) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{1-\\frac{3}{8}}}$.\n### Conclusion: Therefore, $h(2) = \\sqrt{\\frac{5}{2}} = \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{3}{2}} = \\left(1 + \\frac{9}{8",

You have shown that he can analyze complex problems and simplify it. It seems like you can answer odd and even numbers. citations.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is  \\sqrt{\\frac{5}{2}}. I hope it is correct. By evaluating h(2) = sqrt((2+3)/2) = sqrt(5/2), our solution is displayed. I also believe that our mistake is observed. The 2/2 inside the square root is subtracted. Subtracting 2 from the square root does not make any impact, but we have to multiply the square root by 1 to keep it the same. mentioned. ) of h(2) = (5/2))- is the same as h(2) = (5/2))\\). \\\\\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\sqrt{\\frac{5}{2}}.
