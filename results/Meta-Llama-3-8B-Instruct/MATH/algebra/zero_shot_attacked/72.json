        " \nAccording to the instruction, $j$ and $k$ are inversely proportional, which means $j=ck^{-1}$, so we can write $86=ck^{-1}$, when $k=21$.  Since they are inversely proportional, we can write $21=ck^{-1}$ when $k=86$.  Solving either equation gives $c=86\\cdot21=1806$.

Now, substitute $k=14$ to get $j=1806/14=\\boxed{129}$.\n### Getting around of the problem: We can also recognize that if $j$ and $k$ are inversely proportional, we have $j\\cdot k = c$, where $c$ is some constant.  In this case, $c$ turns out to be $86\\cdot21=1806$.  Then, if we substitute $k=14$ we get that $j\\cdot 14 = 1806$, so $j = 1806/14=\\boxed{129}$.

        " k and j are inversely proportional. $k$ is inversely proportional to $j$. It means that $k\\cdot j = \\text{ constant}$. Let's write the given fact: $j = 86$ when $k = 21$. Write the equation $k\\cdot j = \\text{ constant}$. For $j = 86$ and $k = 21$ this would be $21\\cdot86 = 1806$. It gives $\\text{ constant} = 1806$. To make easier  \\infty ce$ substitute constant into $k\\cdot j = \\text{ constant}$: $k\\cdot j = 1806$. Now we are able to solve $j$ when $k$ is 14. We know $k = 14$ and $k\\cdot j = 1806$. So $14\\cdot j = 1806$. Here we divide both sides of the equation by 14 to get: $j = \\frac{1806}{14}=\\boxed{129}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 129. I hope it is correct.

Since we\u2019re given that $j = 86$ when $k = 21$, we can substitute this into our original equation: $$86 = \\frac{c}{21}.$$ To solve for $c$, we can multiply both sides by 21: $$c = 1860.$$\n3.

        " Final Answer: The final answer is 116. I hope it is correct.  Published by S S. Powered by WordPress.  Inverse variation involves two functions and we denote it as f(x1) = $$G(x2)$$ Here, $$J = \\frac{k}{ constant }$$ Just make that relation. Then ask yourself, What constant will make J = 86 when K = 21? So, you can state that 86 = $$\\frac{21}{constant}$$  Multiply both sides with the constant. 86 * constant = 21 * constant 86 = 21 constant So, constant is 4. (Constant should not be negative, right?) Now you know what the relation is J = $$\\frac{k}{4}$$ and you are asked to find J when K = 14. Plug that into the relation, you will get J = $$\\frac{14}{4}$$ = 3.5 (13 remainder)  $$\\frac{k}{4}$$ should be an integer. So, it is not 3.5. Think you can find J by taking multiples of 4?  J = $$\\frac{16}{4}$$ but 16 is not 14, So add 2 to the 16 get 18.  J = $$\\frac{18}{4}$$ = 4.5 (no way it should be 4.5. So add 6 and get 14. The answer will be J = $$\\frac{20}{4}$$ = 5. But no that mean 5 * 4 = 20. We should give it up.  Think from the beginning (J = $$\\frac{k}{4}$$) again. What if you don't find the number from 86 expression? Constants don't give correct integer numbers. It is not reliable and we can't trust constant. So, Think again about writing J = $$k * 4$$ $$\\frac{k}{J}$$ = $$\\frac{J}{86}$$ Transpose the k. J * k = 86  Now, Divide both sides by J, you'll receive. So, what will be the J which gives that 21 when you multiply by k = 21. So, Multiply, you'll get 86, J * 21 = 86. Now look at (J * k = 86) and say that J = 4. But k is not"
