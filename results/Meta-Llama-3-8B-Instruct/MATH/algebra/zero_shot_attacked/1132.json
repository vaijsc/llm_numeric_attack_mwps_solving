Then substitute m+n with 15. 4m+4(15)=4m+60.\nNow we have two equations: m+n=15 and 4m+60.\nWe can rewrite the first equation as m+(n-m)=15. Then m=15-(n-m). Now substitute m=15-(n-m) in the second equation: 4m+60.\n4(15-(n-m))+60. This is equal to 60+4(15)-(4n-4m).\nNow we can simplify 60+4(15)=60+60=120.

Substitute m=15-n in the second equation: 4(15-n)+60.\nNow 4(15-n)+60.\nNow simplify 4(15-n)+60=4(15)-4n+60.\nNow 60+4(15)-4n.\nNow simplify 60+4(15)=120.

        " We can start by making the m into m-n. So we have 4m-4n+4n=47. m-n can be simplified to m. Now we have 4m=47-4n. Now we subtract 47 from both sides. 4m-47=-4n. 4m=47-4n. 4m-47=-4n. We have to multiply both sides by -1 to get 47-4m=-4n. Finally, we have to add 4m to both sides and we will get 47=-4n+4m. Now we can sub m+n=15 into this equation. 47=-4(15)+4m.
