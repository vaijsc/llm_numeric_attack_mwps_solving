We then consider the function $2x/((x-1)$ and $6$, and plot the graph of this function as well. We then see that the values $x=1$ and $x=3$ make it so that the blue line equals $6$ (Since they satisfy $1+2x=6x-6$). Based on this, we can determine that $x=1$ and $x=3$ are the solutions to the equation. Since the blue line is at an undefined slope at the point $x=1$, that is why the solution $x=1$ is defined as an asymptote. The solution $x=3$ is a valid solution that is rational.\nSolution 2: By casework.\nWe have $\\frac{1}{x-1}+\\frac{2x}{x-1}=6$. Then $1+2x=6x-6$, so $5x=7$, so $x=7/5$. By graphing, we can see that there are two other solutions at $x=1$ and $x=3$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 1, 3. I hope it is correct.orentation =$PRO=\u201dcorrect\u201d;",
        " $x = -2, 3$\nThe given equation is: $\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{x-1} + \\frac{2x}{x - 1} = 6$. We can combine $\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{x-1}$ and $\\displaystyle\\frac{2x}{x-1}$ as: $\\displaystyle\\frac{2x+1}{x-1} = 6$. Cross-multiply: $(x-1)(2x+1) = 6(x-1)$. This simplifies to $2x^2+x-6=0$. Now, this is a quadratic, let's factor it. We can find the factors if we find the zeroes of this equation using the quadratic formula. $x = \\dfrac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1-4(2)(-6)}}{4} = \\dfrac{-1 \\pm 5}{4}$. So, $x = \\dfrac{-1-5}{4} = -2$ or $x = \\dfrac{-1+5}{4}= \\dfrac{4}{4} = 1$. Therefore, the values of $x$ are $\\boxed{-2, 3}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -2,3. I hope it is correct.EOS6",
        "  Finally, the question boils down to $\\displaystyle\\frac{1+2x}{x-1}=6$. So multiplying both sides with $(x-1)$, we have $1+2x=6x-6$.\nNow, let\u2019s go to the right-hand side and subtract $6x$ from it. We have $1 = 4x-6$. Moreover, let\u2019s add $6$ to both sides. So we have $7 = 4x$.\nFinally, dividing both sides by $4$, we find the value of $x$.\n### Final Answer: The answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{7}{4}}$. I hope it is correct.

The rational expressions method of solving equations will be useful throughout the course of elementary algebra.

        " \nWe first want to combine the two terms into one by either taking a common denominator (for addition) or a common factor (for subtraction).

        " We can start by multiplying both sides of the equation by $x-1$. Note that if we multiply both sides of the equation by $x-1$, we will end up with the original equation.

We can subtract 1 from the left side and $2x$ from the right side. So, we will get:\n$0 = 6(x-1) - 2x - 1$\nNow, we can add 2x to both sides of the equation. The equation will become:\n$2x = 6(x-1) - 1 + 2x$\nNow, we can simplify the right side of the equation by subtracting 2x from both sides of the equation to get:\n$2x = 6x - 6 - 1$\nNow, we can subtract 6x from both sides of the equation to get:\n$-4x = -6 - 1$\nNow, we can add 6 to both sides of the equation to get:\n$-4x + 6 = -1$\nFinally, we can add 4x to both sides of the equation to get:\n$6 = 1$\nSo, we get $x = \\frac{-6}{4} = -1.5$.
