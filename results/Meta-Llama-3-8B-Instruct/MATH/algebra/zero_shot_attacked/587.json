        " $a$ is the minimum value for $x$, and $b$ is the maximum value for $x$.Let\u2019s focus on the left inequality. To have $2x-4 > -8$ (which is what we get when we distribute the $2$ into the left parenthesis), it means that we need to get the minimum value of $x$ by subtracting $\\frac{-8+4}{2}$ from $2$ to get:\n$$x > -8+4$$. This simplifies to $x > -4$.\n#### MRE1\n#### Solution\n(a) As (2)\n(b) (a) Let's say that we take away 4 from 2 (x-2). Then, we have -8<2x-4<12. If we take both sides back to where they were, we get -8+4<2x<12+4. So, we have -4<2x<16. We know that we get rid of 2x on both sides and divide by 2, so it becomes -4<-x<-8. The inequalities are easier when you take 2 away, but here we do it for the left side. When you take the 2 away, the right side still has the same interpretation, so we have -2 < x - 2 < 8. Since -2 is less than x - 2 than our point, then x -2 must be greater than -2. Since x - 2 < 8, x - 2 must be less than 8. As for x - 2 > -2 and x - 2 < 8, you can now combine them and say -2 < x - 2 < 8. So, -2 + 2 < x < 8 + 2. This simplifies to -2 < x < 10. Therefore, we can say that the values that x take is from -2 up to 10. So, in this case, the values of the solution are -2 < x < 10. Let's go back to a+b now. We have to say -2 + 10.

        " If $-8 < 2(x-2) < 12$, then dividing all the inequalities by 2, we have $-\\frac84< (x - 2) < 6$, which implies $-2 < x - 2 < 6$. Adding 2 to all parts of the inequality, we obtain $-2 + 2 < x - 2 + 2 < 6 + 2$, i.e., $0 < x < 8$. Therefore, we obtain $a = \\boxed{0}$ and $b = \\boxed{8}$. The answer is then $a + b = 0 + 8 = \\boxed8$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 8.

        " $a < x < b$\nPerforming algebra encourages us to isolate the variable $x$ in the center. Thus, we have\n$$-4 < 2x - 4 < 8.$$The next step requires adding 4 to both sides, which nicely aligns with an $LHHH$ pattern:\n$$1 < 2x < 12.$$Once again, algebra suggests we divide both sides by 2. So we do so:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} < x < 6.$$Recall that the format asked for is $a < x < b$. Thus, the solution consists of the lower and upper bounds we have: $a = \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{2}}$ and $b = \\boxed{6}$. An intelligent approach then gives $$a + b = \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{2} + 6 = \\boxed{\\dfrac{11}{2}}.} $$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\frac{11}{2}. I hope it is correct.",
        " \nWe can expand the inequality as\n$$-8 < 2x-4 < 12.$$\nAdding 4 to all parts of the inequality, we get \n$$-4 < 2x < 16.$$Now, divide all parts by 2 to get \n$$-\\frac{4}{2} < x < \\frac{16}{2},$$which simplifies to \n$$-2 < x < 8.$$\nSince $x < 8$ and $x > -2$, we can write the complete inequality in the form $\\boxed{a < x < b}$ with $a = -2$ and $b = 8$, so that $a + b = (-2) + 8 = \\boxed{6}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 6.
