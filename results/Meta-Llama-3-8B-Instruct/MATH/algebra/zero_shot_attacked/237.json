This can be represented by the equation\n$$1+2+3+\\cdots + 399+400=\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$where $n$ is the number of terms in the sequence. In this case, $n=400$.

In this case, the constant is $1$, since each term is one more than the previous term. The equation for an arithmetic series is $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$, where $n$ is the number of terms in the sequence. In this problem, $n=400$, so we plug this into the equation to get $\\frac{400(401)}{2}=80,400$. This is the answer to the problem. Final Answer: The final answer is 80,400. I hope it is correct.

        " \nLet\u2019s think of all the pairs of consecutive numbers. The sum of the consecutive numbers $1$ and $2$ is $3$, and the sum of $3$ and $4$ is $7$. Continuing this, we get $k+(k+1)=2k+1$, where $k$ is the first number in the pair. Since $2k+1$ is an odd number, it must be that the sum of the numbers from $1$ to $400$ is half of the sum of the odd numbers from $1$ to $2\\cdot400$ (and in the process of proving this, we will get a formula for how to find the sum of the odd numbers, even though we didn\u2019t really care about finding that). Therefore, the sum we want is equal to half of the sum of the odd numbers from $1$ to $800$.  Now, we would like to find a formula for the sum of the odd numbers, which means we can use the base 10 sum formula, because it\u2019s designed for finding the sum of an arithmetic sequence. In particular, we have the formula for the sum of the first $n$ terms of an arithmetic sequence with a common difference $d$ and a first term $a_1$: $$S_{n} = \\frac{n}{2}(2a_1+(n-1)d)$$Let\u2019s apply this to our situation. The first term of the sequence is $1$, and the common difference is $2$, so we have $$S_2 = \\frac{2}{2}(2\\cdot1+(2-1)\\cdot2) = 2\\cdot 3 = 6$$What is weird about this is that $2$ is not an even number, so we should have modified this formula a bit. Another way to think about the problem is using polynomial multiplication and algebraic simplification. To get the sum of the first $n$ odd numbers, say \u2018$S$\u2019 ,we will first define the sum of the first $2n$ integers and then extract the even number sum from it. The sum of the first $2n$ integers ($n$ odd numbers or pairs) is equal to $$\\sum_1^{2n} i = 1+2+3+...+2n$$Now we can use the (finite) summation polynomial. In mathematical form we write it as: $$1\\cdot1+2\\cdot2+",
        "  ####  #### \nThe expression is an arithmetic series, which we can simplify using the formula:\n$$1 + 2 + 3 + \\cdots + k = \\frac{k(k+1)}{2}$$\nIn this case, the last term is 400, and there are 400 terms in total. So we use\n$$1 + 2 + 3 + \\cdots + 399 + 400 = \\frac{400(400+1)}{2} = 80,100$$\nSo 1 + 2 + 3 + \u22ef + 399 + 400 is equal to $\\boxed{80,100}$.\n### Proof:\n1  It is sufficient to show that any number in this sequence is either 1 more than some previous number, or 1 less than some following number.  This can be seen from the pattern of the sequence, so this shows that everything can be written as some combination of the numbers from 1 to 400 in increments of 1 or -1.\n2  It is also a well known fact that the sum of any arithmetic sequence follows the formula:\n$$1 + 2 + 3 + \\cdots + k = \\frac{k(k+1)}{2}.$$This can be derived by pairing each number in the sequence with the next number, and noticing that the sum of each pair is equal to $k + 1$.  Therefore, the sum of the entire sequence is equal to the sum of the pairs, so:\n$$1 + 2 + 3 + \\cdots + k = \\frac{k(k+1)}{2}$$",
