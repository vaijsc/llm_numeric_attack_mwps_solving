We know that each team plays every other team, so $n(n-1)$ is the number of games each team plays. The total number of games played is $n(n-1)/2,$ so we can set up the following equation:\n$$\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}=70$$\nSimplifying the left-hand side of the equation, we have\n$$\\frac{n^2-n}{2}=70$$\nExpanding the left-hand side of the equation and combining like terms gives\n$$n^2-n=140$$\nFactoring the left-hand side of the equation gives\n$$(n-14)(n+10)=0$$\nSolving the factored equation gives $n=14$ or $n=-10.$ Since we are dealing with a real-world scenario and a nonnegative number of teams, we choose $n=\\boxed{14}.$\n#### Disclaimer:\nThis problem is from mbtest.com.

        " Let\u2019s create a brand new variable n and represent\nLet\u2019s represent the number of teams as a variable denoted as $n.$ Then, we are given that $\\frac{n^{2}-n}{2}=70.$ We want to express $n$ in terms of $70.$ So, we will multiply $2$ to both sides of the equation to get $n^{2}-n=140.$ This is a quadratic equation. We can solve it using the quadratic formula: $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^{2} - 4ac}}{2a} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1^{2} - 4(1)(-140)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{561}}{2}$ Since $561$ is a prime number, we cannot simplify it easily. But we can find the sign of the square root. $\\sqrt{561}$ is positive. Now, we will express $n$ in terms of $70.$\nSo, the number of teams is given by the final answer $\\boxed{13}.$$Thank you.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 13.

        " Let $n$ be the number of teams in a round-robin tournament in which 70 games are played. Then:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{n^2-n}{2}&=70\\\\\nn^2-n&=140\\\\\nn^2-n-140&=0\n\\end{align*}\nWe must factor $n^2-n-140$, which is $n^2+n-196=(n-14)(n+14)$. Setting each factor equal to zero and solving for $n$, we obtain\n\\begin{align*}\nn-14&=0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad n&=14,\\\\\nn+14&=0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad n&=-14.\n\\end{align*}\nHowever, $n$ represents the number of teams, so it must be positive.

        " To find the number of teams in a round-robin tournament with 70 games, we solve the equation $(n^2-n)/2=70$ for $n$, by multiplying both sides by $2$ to obtain $n^2-n=140,$ or $0=(n-8)(n+17)$.\n### Explanation:\n### Context\n### Exercise_start\n### Exercise_end\nThe function $(n^2-n)$ is a quadratic function in $n$, so we would expect a solution by factoring it.\n### ",
        " \nBased on the given information, we can set up an equation to solve for $n$. Let $n$ be the number of teams in the round-robin tournament.\nWe know that the number of games that must be played is $(n^2-n)/2$. Since the number of games played is 70, we can write:\n$$\\frac{n^2-n}{2}=70$$\nTo solve for $n$, we can first multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get:\n$$n^2-n=140$$\nNext, we can factor the left-hand side of the equation:\n$$(n-14)(n+10)=0$$\nThis gives us two possible values for $n$: $n=14$ and $n=-10$. However, since the number of teams cannot be negative, we can disregard the value $n=-10$.\nTherefore, the number of teams in the round-robin tournament is $\\boxed{14}$. This makes sense, since 14 is a plausible number of teams for a tournament.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 14. I hope it is correct.",
