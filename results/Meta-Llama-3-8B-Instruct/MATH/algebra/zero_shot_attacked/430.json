        " We know this in detail.\nA line is drawn through the points $(-5,8)$ and $(-3,-1)$. We need to find the $y$-coordinate of the point where this line intersects the $y$-axis. Let us break down the problem:\n1. We need to find the equation of the line. The equation of a line that passes through two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by:\n$\\frac{y-y_1}{y_2-y_1}=\\frac{x-x_1}{x_2-x_1}$\nSubstitute the points $(-5,8)$ and $(-3,-1)$ in the equation:\n$\\frac{y-8}{-1-8}=\\frac{x-(-5)}{-3-(-5)}$\nSimplify the equation:\n$\\frac{y-8}{-9}=\\frac{x+5}{2}$\nMultiply both sides by 9 to eliminate the fraction:\n$y-8=-9x-45$\n$y=-9x+53$\n2. Now, we need to find the $y$-coordinate of the point where this line intersects the $y$-axis. This point lies at $(0,y)$. Substitute $x=0$ in the equation:\n$y=-9(0)+53$\n$y=\\boxed{53}$\nTherefore, the $y$-coordinate of the point where this line intersects the $y$-axis is 53. \n### Final Answer: The final answer is 53.

        "  Since the line goes through $(-5, 8)$ and $(-3, -1)$, it must have slope\nm = \\frac{ -1 - 8 }{ -3 - (-5) } = \\frac{ -9 }{-2} = \\frac{9}{2}.\nThis line has a slope of $\\frac{9}{2}$, so it is in the form $y-\\textrm{intercept} = m(x-\\textrm{intercept})$. We can use the point $(-5, 8)$ to solve for the slope and find the line\u2019s equation. We can use the point $(-3, -1)$ to solve for the $y$-intercept. Solving for the slope, we have\n8 - m(-5) = 0 \\Rightarrow 8 + \\frac{9}{2} \\cdot 5 = 0 \\Rightarrow \\frac{29}{2} = 14.5.  Then, we know that the line is:\ny - y\\textrm{-intercept} = \\frac{9}{2}(x - (-5)) \\Rightarrow y - y\\textrm{-intercept} = \\frac{9}{2}(x+5). Plugging in the point $(-3, -1)$, we have\n-1 - y\\textrm{-intercept} = \\frac{9}{2}(-3 + 5) \\Rightarrow -1 - y\\textrm{-intercept} = \\frac{9}{2}(2) \\Rightarrow -1 - y\\textrm{-intercept} = 9.

That means that the point where the line intersects the $y$-axis has $y$-coordinate $\\boxed{8}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 8. I hope it is correct.

        " [I think I have it!] Suppose we draw a line through the points $(-5, 8)$ and $(-3, -1)$ as in the following graph:\n![exp9-1](/CPP/figure/exp9-1.png)\nAs we see from the graph, we can find the slope of the line: \\begin{align*}\nm&=\\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}\\\\\n&=\\frac{-1-8}{-3-(-5)}\\\\\n&=\\frac{-9}{2}\n\\end{align*}\nSo, we now have the equation $y-8=\\frac{-9}{2}(x+5)$.

Rearranging, we have $\\frac{9}{2}x=\\frac{7}{2}$, so $x=\\frac{7}{9}$. $x$-coordinate of the point $P$ is $\\frac{7}{9}$, which means that $y$-coordinate of the point $P$ is $\\boxed{0}$.

However, at the end, you are given the point $\\left(\\frac{7}{9}, 0\\right)$, and since you can tell that this point must be on the $y$-axis, you can simply read off the answer as $0$. No need to solve the equation you wrote! That's a nice shortcut. So, your final answer should simply be $\\boxed{0}$. For solving equality, can you write out the answer as $0$? Please do so, without any words. $\\boxed{0}$\nupdate: You can disregard the last sentence of the previous message. Keep it in mind as you are solving other equations in the future.\nHope I could help! If you have",
        " Let the line intersect the y-axis at $(0,y).$ If both $(0,y)$ and $(-3,-1)$ lie on the line $L,$ then the line $L$ and the point $(0, y)$ are perpendicular.  Since we are given the slope of the line $L$ first, which is $$m=\\frac{-1-8}{-3-(-5)}=-\\frac{9}{2},$$ we can use the right triangle formed by the points $(0,y)$, $(-3,-1)$ and $(-5,8)$ to find $y.$  Since the line $L$ is perpendicular with the point $(0,y)$ and has length 9, the hypotenuse has length 9.  So the line now forms a right triangle of length $\\sqrt{9^2+8^2}=\\sqrt{113}$ and applying the Pythagorean Formula gives us $$\\frac{y-(-1)}{\\sqrt{113}}=1$$ or $$y-(-1)=\\sqrt{113}$$ or $$y-1=\\sqrt{113}$$ then finally $$y = \\boxed{2+\\sqrt{113}}$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2+\\sqrt{113}.
