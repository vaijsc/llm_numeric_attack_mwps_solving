        "  We begin by considering the situation described in the problem. Josh and Mike are both riding their bicycles. Josh goes in the direction of Mike\u2019s house, and Mike goes in the direction of Josh\u2019s house. They will eventually meet. The information that is given is that Josh rides for 3 times as long as Mike, and he rides at a pace that is 4/5 of Mike\u2019s pace.\n#### An idea:  This is a rate and ratio problem!\nLet\u2019s call the time it takes for Mike to ride the distance $$t$$. Then we know that the time it takes for Josh to ride the same distance will be $$3t$$. We also know that the distance that Mike rides is equal to the distance that Josh rides. \n#### Final Thoughts: \nI know this problem and we must use rates.  So, I can solve this problem this way.  The rates we will need will be Mike's rate, Josh's rate, and the distance the two riders travel.\n###  I hope this cleared things up!

        " \nWe can solve this problem by labeling the variables and creating an equation.\nLet x be the rate at which Mike rides his bicycle in miles per hour. Let m be the number of miles Mike rode when they met. Let y be the time that Mike rode for hours.\nMike travels at a rate of x miles/hour, so he travels for y hours and goes m miles. Therefore, the distance that Mike travels can be described by the equation:\nm = xy\nJosh travels at a rate of 4/5x miles/hour and rides for three times as long as Mike, which is equivalent to 3y hours. Since Josh travels from his house to Mike's house and back, his total distance is equal to 13 miles. We can describe Josh's distance with the equation:\n13 = 4/5xy(3y)\nNow we have two equations and two variables. We can use substitution or elimination to solve this system of equations. Let's use substitution. First, we can solve the equation 13 = 4/5xy(3y) for y:\ny = 13/(4/5xy * 3)\nWe can simplify this expression by eliminating the fraction:\ny = 13/(0.8xy * 3)\ny = 13/2.4xy\nNow we can substitute this expression for y into the equation m = xy:\nm = x(13/2.4xy)\n18/24xy = m\nSimplifying gives:\nm = 3/4x\nWe can substitute this expression for m into the equation m = xy to solve for x:\n3/4x = xy\nSimplifying gives:\n0 = 1/4x^2\nx = 0\nx can't be zero, so this means that there is no solution. In reality, the rates at which Josh and Mike ride their bicycles are reciprocals of each other. For example, if Mike rides at a rate of 4 miles/hour, Josh rides at a rate of 1 mile/0.8 hour. Using this information, we can rewrite the equation 13 = 4/5xy(3y):\n13 = 4/5x(4/5xy)(3y)\nWe can simplify each side by eliminating the fractions:\n13 = 0.8xy(0.8y)\nSimplifying gives:\n13 = 0.64xy^2\nWe can solve this equation by notice that xy must be ",
        " So, let\u2019s think step by step.\n### Step 1: Think of variables for distance and time. Let\u2019s set up two variables. Let d be the distance between their houses, m = distance traveled by Mike, and j = distance traveled by Josh.\n### 1. Step 1: Think of variables for distance and time. Let\u2019s set up two variables. Let d be the distance between their houses, m=distance traveled by Mike and j=distance traveled by Josh.\nSo, d = 13 miles. As stated, Josh rode for three times the length of time as Mike, and at four-fifths of Mike\u2019s rate. In notation, this translates to:\n### 2. j = 3m and j= 4/5m\nSubstituting m = (5/4)j, we get:\n### 3. j = 3(5/4)j\nNow we can solve for j. Simplifying, we get:\n### 4. j = (15/4)j\n### 5. j = 4j\n### 6. j = 4j\nWe know j = 13 miles, which makes sense since Josh went to meet Mike, and m = j - d. Substituting and solving for m, we get:\n### 7. d = 26\n### 8. m = 9\nSo, when they met, Mike had ridden 9 miles.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 9. I hope it is correct. ### Step 9: Check that answer. This shows that when Josh starts riding at 4/5 the rate of Mike and Josh has ridden 3 times longer than Mike, the distance they have traveled is equal to the distance between their houses.\n### Final Answer: The final answer is 9.

        "  To simplify, let\u2019s split the question into two parts.  First, we can introduce variables for the distance and time.  The distance around is $13$ miles.  Also, $13$ miles is the entire distance, but Josh only rode a fraction of this.  Let $t$ be the time Mike rode in hours and let $d$ be the distance Mike rode in miles.  Then $d=rt$.  We can use this with the known information $t+\\dfrac{3}{4}t=1$ hours.\nFor Mike\u2019s outcome, it is presented as \u201cHow many miles had Mike ridden?\u201d Therefore, we must elevate the result of our variable $d$ to,response: $\\boxed{\\frac{13}{10} \\text{ miles}}$\n### ",

        " \nHere, we let x be the distance of the path that Mike has ridden.  So, Mike travels at rate m. Thus, in t time, he travels x = mt.\nTo make things simpler we can name: m = Mike's rate (in miles per hour), t = time (in hours)\nWe get, x = mt \n### Explanation: \nFrom here, we have to create a new equation. For Josh bike, travel rate is j, travel time is s, and distance traveled is j*s.\nSo, the total distance they both have to travel to meet is the sum of their individual travels.\nWe see that j*s is the remaining distance.\nj*s = 13 - x  ... (1)\nWe know Josh's speed is four-fifths of Mike's speed.\nj = (4/5) m  ... (2)\nWe know Josh traveled for three times as much as time as Mike. So,\ns = 3 t ... (3)\nFrom here we have to link these all together. From equation (2) we get, j*s = (4/5)m*3t. \nLet us combine this with equation (1).\nWe get, (4/5)m*3t = 13 - x\nChange m*3t as 3mt\n(4/5)3mt = 13 - x  ... (4)\n### Assertion: \nThis is an equation in terms of x. Now we need to solve for x. \nHow much more distance have they covered together? Add the combined distance covered.\n### Conclusion:\nThe final answer is: 9.6 miles. I hope it is correct. Thanks! \nOther response:\nAnother way is :\nThe formula for distance is Distance = Speed * Time.\nLet's use this to solve the problem:\nWe know that Josh and Mike started riding towards each other and met, so they together covered the entire distance - 13 miles.\nWe know that Josh traveled for 3 times as much time as Mike, so this means Josh spent 3t hours riding and Mike spent t hours riding.\nWe also know that Josh traveled at a speed of 4/5 of Mike's speed, so Josh traveled at a speed of (4/5)*m. Mike rode at a speed of m.\nSince they both rode together for the same distance, we know that the total distance they rode together is equal to 13 miles. So we set up our equation: \n13 = (4/5",
        " The key is to realize that the average speed of the two boys together is half the distance between them. So let's let $d$ be the number of miles Mike rode when they met. The ratio of the rates at which Josh and Mike rode is $$\\frac{\\text{Speed of Josh}}{\\text{Speed of Mike}} = \\frac{4/5}{1} = \\frac{4}{5}.$$The ratio of the time they rode is $$\\frac{\\text{Time of Josh}}{\\text{Time of Mike}} = \\frac{3}{1}.$$Since the total distance is 13, the distance Mike rode is the average of the total distance and half of it, which is $$d = \\frac{13}{2} = 6.5$$miles. In 1 hour, Josh rode 4/5 * 6.5 = 5.2 miles and Mike rode 1 * 6.5 = 6.5 miles. Then in 1 hour Mike will ride 6.5 / 6.5 = 1 mile. So if Josh rode 3 * (amount of time Mike rode), he rode 3 * 1 = 3 hours. If Mike rode for 1 hour, he rode 6.5 miles. 6.5 / 1 = 6.5, so 3 / 1 = 3 / 6.5 = 0.462, so Mike rode for 0.462 hours, or 27.72 minutes.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 6.5. I hope it is correct.  I have updated the answer which is 27.72 minutes 27.72 minutes / 60 = 0.462 hours and that is 1/2 as long as 3 hours. So the amount of time it took Josh to ride is 3 hours. The amount of time it took Mike to ride is 0.462 hours. The distance rode by Mike is 6.5 miles. In order to figure out what percentage of the distance was covered by Mike, we need to divide the distance to be covered by Mike by the total distance and multiply by the percentage.\n### Josh and Mike rode together when Josh had ridden for three times as long as Mike, and at 4/5 of Mike's rate. To find the distance that they rode, we use the formula d = rt, where d is distance, r is rate and t",
        " \nThis problem is starting to get a bit difficult! We can use our step-by-step thinking methods to solve for Mike\u2019s distance. Let\u2019s think. \nStep 1: Start by defining the variables. \nLet x = Mike\u2019s time spent in minutes.\nLet y = Josh\u2019s time spent in minutes. \nStep 2: Write the rate and distance equation for Josh. \nJosh\u2019s rate is y and he rides a distance of 13 miles. \nDistance = Rate * Time, so 13 = y * y (Josh rides 4/5 the speed of Mike).\nStep 3: Write the rate and distance equation for Mike. \nMike\u2019s rate is x, and he rides a distance of x miles (he rides until they meet).\nStep 4: Substitute y = 4/5x into the equation for Josh. \n13 = (4/5x) * y, but we want to get y in terms of x. \nStep 5: Multiply both sides by x to get rid of the fraction.\n13x = 4x^2, \nDivide both sides by x.\n13 = 4x. \nStep 6: Solve for x, the time spent by Mike. \nx = 13/4 = 3.25.\nStep 7: Now we need to find the distance Mike rode, which is 3.25x. \nRemember that D = Rate * Time, so Mike\u2019s rate is x. \nMike\u2019s distance = Rate * Time = x * 3.25 = 3.25^2 = 10.625 miles. \nThe answer is 10.625. \nThis problem really forced us to think step-by-step and use our algebra skills to solve! \nFinal Answer: The final answer is 10.625.

However, there is a small mistake. The correct answer is 13/3 = 4.33 miles, not 13 miles. Here\u2019s how you would present the feedback:\nGreat job! You\u2019re really close! The only mistake you made is in the last step. Remember, when we substitute 13/3 for x, you should get 4.33 miles, not 13 miles. Keep practicing and you will get even better at this! Well done! \n### Code For This Problem:\n```\n# Let Mike's speed be m miles per hour\n# Distance = Speed * Time\n# Given conditions:\n# Josh's speed = (4/5) * Mike's speed = m * (4/5)\n# Josh's time = 3 * Mike's time\n# Since Josh's distance = Mike's distance = 13 miles\n# m * 3 * (1/3) = 13\n# m = 13/3 = 4.33 miles\n# Therefore, Mike's distance = 13/3 = 4.33 miles\n```\nThis problem involves solving a system of linear equations. You can represent Mike\u2019s distance and Josh\u2019s distance with variables x and y. Then, you can set the equation Josh\u2019s distance = 13 and solve for Mike\u2019s distance. \nAlternatively, you can use the given information to calculate the speed of Josh and Mike.

        " We start with the equation for the distance (d), speed (v), and time (t):\nd = v * t\nTo incorporate the given information, we can find the speeds of Josh and Mike separately, then equate them to solve for the distance (miles) that Mike rode when they met.\nJosh rode for three times the length of time as Mike. So, $$t_{josh} = 3 * t_{mike}$$ where josh stands for Josh, and mike stands for Mike.\nJosh rode at four-fifths of Mike\u2019s rate.

Since Josh started to ride before Mike started, he must have already been a certain distance away from Mike's house when Mike started. Josh's riding speed is 4/5 of Mike's speed, but he has been riding for 3 times as long. Consider the following equation:\nd = dst + (4/5) * dmi * 3t\nwhere:\nd is the",
        " \nTo solve this problem, we can use the following method:\n1. Let t be the time it took for Mike to ride his bicycle. Then, 3t is the time it took for Josh to ride his bicycle.\n2. The total distance Josh and Mike travelled is equal to the distance between their homes. So, \n```\n0.8t * 13 = 3t * 0.8\n```\n3. So, `0.8t * 13 = 3t * 0.8`, we can simplify the equation by dividing by `0.8t`: \n```\n13 = 3.6 * 3\n```\nAnd therefore, the distance that Mike travelled is `t` = `13 / 3.6` = `3.61` miles. Answer is 3.61. Got it right in 1 step! was created by generation. Have you got any other questions about this topic? If you have, I'd be happy to help! \nFinal Answer: The final answer is 3.61. I hope it is correct. ",
        " We will use variable substitution method. Let us say the distance Mike cycled be \u201cm\u201d.\nNow the question states that Josh cycled for 3 times the length of time as Mike and at 4/5 of Mike's rate. So let the distance Josh cycled be \u201cj\u201d. Then we can say: j = 3 * m * (4/5) = 12/5 * m. Now Josh cycled 12/5 times the distance of Mike.\nNow Josh and Mike meet. The sum of their distances is 13 miles. So, the total distance cycled by both Josh and Mike is 13.\nSo, 13 = m + (12/5)*m.\nNow simplify the equation: 13 = 17/5*m.\nNow divide both sides by 17/5: m = 13 * 5/17.\nNow simplify m = 5.\nSo Mike cycled 5 miles. The answer is 5 miles.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 5. I hope it is correct. This method is also known as the fidget method. It can be very useful for solving systems of linear equations or combination problems.",
        " \nLet m be the rate of Mike.  m represents the number of miles Mike rides in one hour.  t_m is the time it takes Mike to ride when they met.  When they met, Josh had ridden three times the length of time as Mike.  So, $t_j=3t_m$.\n### (1)\nJosh rode his bicycle at a rate of four-fifths of Mike\u2019s rate. That is, $\\frac{4}{5}m$ number of miles per hour.  $t_j$ is the time it took for Josh to ride when they met, so $t_j=\\frac{d_j}{(\\frac{4}{5}m)}$, where $d_j$ is the distance Josh traveled when they met.   In equation (1), the distance traveled by Josh must be the distance between them which was given as $13$ miles. $d_j=13$, so $13=(\\frac{4}{5}m)t_j$.\n### (2)\nJosh and Mike meet, so the distance traveled by Mike is the sum of the distance traveled by Josh and the distance between them.  Thus $d_m=d_j+13$.  Substitute this in equation (1):\n### (3)\nNow, substitute equation ($1$) in ($2$).\n#### $\\begin{split}\nd_m&=13+(\\frac{4}{5}m)(3t_m)\\\\\n&=13+(4m)(t_m)\\\\\n\\end{split}$\n#### Divide by m.\n#### $t_m=\\frac{\\frac{13}{m}}{4+\\frac{4}{m}}$\n#### $\\frac{1}{m}$ is a part of the fraction because we had to get rid of $m$ first.\n#### $\\it{Simplify\\; fraction:}$\n#### $\\frac{13}{m}$ is divided by $\\frac{m}{m}=1$\n#### $\\frac{13}{m}=\\frac{13}{1}\\times\\frac{1}{m}$\n#### $\\frac{13}{1}\\times\\frac{1}{m}=\\frac{13}{m}$\n#### $\\frac{13}{m}\\div \\frac{m}{m}=\\frac{13}{m}$\n#### $t_m=\\frac{13+4}{4m}$\n#### $\\boxed{t_m=\\frac{13}{4m}}$\n#### The distance traveled by Mike is $d_m",
        " Suppose that Mike bikes at a rate of 2 mph, and so he rides x miles. Since Josh bikes at 4/5 Mike's rate, he bikes at 4/5 * 2 = 8/5 = 1.6 mph. He bikes for 3x times longer than Mike, which is x * 3.\nSo, in total, the distance each travelled is:\nJosh: 1.6x * 3 = 4.8x\nMike: 2x\nThe total distance between them is 13 miles, and as they both are biking, the distance they have both travelled so far has to be equal to the distance left, which is 13 miles.\u00a0 So, we have 4.8x + 2x = 13. By solving for x, we get:\nx = 1.25 miles\nSo, Mike has travelled 2 * 1.25 miles = 2.5 miles.",
        " \nLet J be Josh\u2019s rate and let M be Mike\u2019s rate. Let t be the time Josh rode his bicycle and let u be the time Mike rode his bicycle. Since Josh rode for three times the length of time as Mike, we can say that $t=3u$. Since Josh rode at four-fifths of Mike\u2019s rate, we can say that $J=\\frac{4}{5}M$. We can now form an equation to find M.\n\\begin{align*}\nJt &= Mu\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\quad \\frac{4}{5}Mt &= Mu\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\quad 4Mt &= 5Mu\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\quad 4(3u) &= 5u\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad u&=\\boxed{4}\n\\end{align*}\nThe value of u is 4, so Mike rode 4 miles when they met.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 4. I hope it is correct.### ",

        " \nLet\u2019s translate this into variables. Suppose Mike rides his bicycle at a rate of $m \\text{ miles per minute}$. Josh rides at $\\frac{4}{5}m \\text{ miles per minute}$. Since Mike rode for a little time, let\u2019s say, $t \\text{ minutes}$. Josh rode at three times the length of this time, i.e., $3t \\text{ minutes}$. \nMike rode $m \\cdot t \\text{ miles}$, while Josh rode $\\frac{4}{5}m \\cdot 3t \\text{ miles} = \\frac{12}{5}m \\cdot t \\text{ miles}.$ \nWe are given that Josh had ridden 3 times the length of time he rode, and they met at the midpoint of their travel. Therefore, \n$m \\cdot t = \\frac{12}{5}m \\cdot t - 6.5$\nWhich simplifies to \n$\\boxed{3.5m = 6.5}$. Therefore, $m = 1.86$ miles per minute. Josh rode for 3t minutes which simplifies to 3t = 2.43 minutes and, therefore, Mike rode for approximately $\\boxed{0.81 \\text{ miles}}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 0.81 \\text{ miles}. I hope it is correct. \n",
        " To help me think about this question, I will make a little diagram with some of the information.\nHere is the diagram:\nIn the  diagram, \nMike starts at the position we will call $M$.\nJosh starts at the position we will call $J$.\nBoth of them are riding towards each other. \nLet $t$ be the time that it takes for Josh to ride $x$ miles.\nLet $t/3$ be the time that it takes for Mike to ride $x$ miles.\nThe  diagram now looks like this:\nWhen the two cyclists meet, Josh has ridden $x$ miles and Mike has ridden $x/3$ miles.\nThe distance between $J$ and $M$ at this moment is  $13 - x$.\nWe are also given that Josh rode at $\\frac{4}{5}$  Mike\u2019s rate for a time of $t$.\nSo Josh\u2019s speed is $\\frac{x}{t}$.\nMike\u2019s speed is $\\frac{x/3}{t/3} = \\frac{4}{5} \\frac{x}{t}$.\nTherefore, $\\frac{x}{t} = \\frac{4}{5} \\frac{x}{3t}$.\nSimplifying this equation, we obtain $x = \\frac{4}{15} x$.\nOr $x = 4$.\nThis means that Josh rode $4$ miles.\nThis also means that the distance between $J$ and $M$ when they met is $9$ miles.\nMike rode for $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the time that it took Josh to ride $4$ miles.\nTherefore, Mike rode for $t/3 = \\frac{t}{9}$.\nThe distance Mike rode is $x/3 = 4/3$.\nSo the answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{4}{3}}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\frac{4}{3}. I hope it is correct.  ### Linear equation: We can also solve this problem using linear equation. Let $x$ be the distance that Josh rode. Let $y$ be the distance that Mike rode. We are given that $x=4y$, since Josh rode three times the distance as Mike. We are also given that $\\frac{x}{t} = \\frac{4}{5} \\frac{y}{t}$, so $x=\\frac{4}{5}y$. Combining these two equations, we can get the equation",
        " \nLet's label Josh's speed by J and let's label Mike's speed by M. Because Josh rode 4/5ths of Mike's rate, we can write the equation $\\frac{13}{J}=\\frac{4}{5}\\cdot\\frac{13}{M}$.\nWe can simplify this equation by multiplying both sides by JM to get $13M=52J$.\nWe also know that Josh rode for 3 times the length of time as Mike, which means we can write the equation $J=3M$. We can substitute this equation into the previous equation to get\n$13M=52(3M)$. We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by $52$ to get $M=13/3$.\nSo, Mike rode $\\boxed{\\frac{13}{3}}$ miles when they met.",
        " Let $M$ be the distance Mike traveled and let $t$ be the time in hours. So we have the following:\nDistance = rate * time so $M = rt=0.4Mt/3$\nWe also have that rate = distance/time so we can write rate as $M/t$. Substituting this back into $M = rt$ we get $M=M/t*t$ $\\Rightarrow M*t=rt$\nSo finally we have $M*t=M*t/3$\nSo $M*t=0.333M*t$\nSolving for $M*t$ we get $M*t=0$\nWe get M=0 and t=0 !info\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 0.

        " Josh started to ride before Mike did.   Since they are heading towards each other, they will eventually meet at a point that is midway between their houses.   When they meet, Josh has only rode \u00bd of the distance, since he was riding towards the other end.  That is 6.5 miles.   Let\u2019s say 6.5 is to Josh as the unknown distance is to Mike.   This tells us that Josh rides 4/5 of the distance in the same time Mike rides the total distance.   Let the time Mike rides his bike be x. Mike rides the total distance, which is 13 \u2013 6.5 = 6.5 miles.   As they meet each other, Mike has only rode \u00bd of this distance, or 3.25 miles.    This lets us set up the given time equation:\n$$x \\cdot 5/4 = 0.5$$    Divide both sides by 5/4, we get x = 0.4 hours.",
        " I see that Mike rides at x miles/hour. Then, his time = 13/x when he met Josh. Meanwhile, Josh rides at (4/5)x miles/hour , so his time = 13/(4/5)x = 13 * 5/4x. Since Josh rides three times more time than Mike, then 13 * 5/4x = 3 * 13/x --> 5/4 = 3/x --> 5 = 12/x and then x = 5/3 and his time = 13/(5/3) = 13 * 3/5 = 13 * 3/5. The final answer is 13 * 3/5. I hope it is correct.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 13 * 3/5. I hope it is correct. ### Given Information: Josh and Mike live 13 miles apart. Yesterday Josh started to ride his bicycle toward Mike's house. A little later Mike started to ride his bicycle toward Josh's house. When they met, Josh had ridden for three times the length of time as Mike and at four-fifths of Mike's rate. Final Answer: The final answer is 13 * 3/5. I hope it is correct. Let\u2019s define the variables: Let x be the time that Mike rides his bike. Then Josh rides his bike for 3x. Let r be the rate that Mike rides his bike. Then Josh rides his bike at 4/5r. We can set up an equation for the total distance that each of them rides: 13 = r * x + 4/5r * 3x 13 = (1 + 12/5)rx 13 = (13/5)rx Combine all the like terms to the left side of the equation: (13/5)rx - 13 = 0 Use the inverse operation to isolate x: x = 13/(13/5) Multiply the fractions first: x = 13 * 5/13 Simplify the fraction: x = 5/3 Convert the time to miles: x = 5/3 * r Multiply by the rate: x = 5r/3 Substitute 5b/3 for x into the distance equation: 13 = (13/5) * (5b/3) + 4/5 * 4/5 * (5b/3) Simplify the fractions: 13 ="
