Replace y with the expression we found above.\n$$x+\\frac{35}{x}=22$$\nNow we multiply both sides by x.\n$$x^2+35=22x$$\nNow we subtract 22x from both sides.\n$$x^2-22x+35=0$$\nThis is a quadratic equation.

It follows that the value of y that makes this equation true is where the y-intercept, or where the linear expression equals zero, and where the parabola y^2/22 intersects the x-axis. This value of y is 3.5.\nNow we can back-substitute y = 3.5 into the original equation for x, x = 22 - y. Therefore, x = 18.5.\nFinally, we can calculate the positive difference between the numbers:\n|18.5 - 3.5| = 15\nThe positive difference between the two numbers is 15. The correct answer is 15.",

        " \nSince the sum of the two numbers is 22, we can set up an equation using the variable x to represent the first number:\nx + 2x = 22\nCombine like terms:\n3x = 22\nDivide both sides by 3:\nx = 22/3\nNow we know the value of x. The second number is the sum minus the value of x (which we just found), so we get:\n22 \u2013 x\n= 22 \u2013 22/3\n= 22/3\nNow we know the values of both numbers. The difference between the numbers (or the absolute value of the difference, since we don\u2019t care about which number is larger) is:\n22/3 \u2013 22/3\n= 0\nThe positive difference between the numbers is 0, which means they are equal! We can rewrite the equation to observe this:\nx = 22/3 = y\nThis tells us that the numbers are equal. In this case, the problem is badly posed, because there is no way for a product of two numbers to be 35 (35 is not a perfect square). But if the problem were well-posed, we would have gotten a non-zero difference; since the question asks for the positive difference, we would need to consider the absolute value of this difference. Based on this, we would observe that the positive difference between the numbers is 0. Remember to always double-check your assumptions and consider potential flaws in the problem before jumping to a solution![/paula/sha/3tu]\n[2021, 2022, 2023]\n[School] [North America] [/Paula] [/Sha/>\n=====\n",
        " \nWe know that the sum of the two numbers is 22, so we can denote them by $x$ and $y$, with $x + y = 22$.  We also know that their product is 35, so $xy = 35$.\n### ",
        " Given that two numbers, say x and y, meet the following conditions:\n1. Their sum is 22.\n2. Their product is 35.\nWe can start by writing these as two equations.\n$x + y = 22$ ... (Equation 1)\n$x y = 35$ ... (Equation 2)\n(Notice that the variables x and y are positive because the problem asked for the positive difference between the two numbers.)\nNow we can try to solve for x and y using different methods. For instance, we can try substitution or elimination. Since the product of the two numbers is 35, we can write:\n$y = \\frac{35}{x}$\nSubstitute this expression for y into Equation 1:\n$x + \\frac{35}{x} = 22$\nNow multiply both sides of the equation by x to eliminate the fraction:\n$x^2 + 35 = 22 x$\nSubtract 22x from both sides to get:\n$x^2 - 22 x + 35 = 0$\nFactor the left side:\n$(x - 5)(x - 7) = 0$\nThis tells us that either (x - 5) = 0 or (x - 7) = 0.\nSolving for x gives us the possible values of x: x = 5 and x = 7.\nNow we can find y using the expressions we found earlier:\nIf x = 5, then y = 35/5 = 7.\nIf x = 7, then y = 35/7 = 5.\nSo we have two possible solutions: x = 5 and y = 7, or x = 7 and y = 5.\nIn either case, the positive difference between the numbers is the same:\n|5 - 7| = |7 - 5| = 2\nThe final answer is: The positive difference between the numbers is 2. \u2192\n### Comment:\nThe problem is asking to find the positive difference between the numbers. We can solve this by first determining the numbers themselves, then subtracting the smaller number from the larger number. We know that the sum of the two numbers is 22 and their product is 35. We can set up an equation and solve for x and y. Once the values for x and y are found, we can take the positive difference. In this case, the difference between the numbers is 2. This is the correct answer and approach.",
        "  Course of Viewing, No of Page is on Youtube\nLet's use variables for the two numbers, then set up two equations. Suppose the numbers are x and y. The sum of the numbers is 22, which means that x + y = 22. Similarly, since the product of the numbers is 35, we know that xy = 35.\nWe then solve the system of equations. Multiply the first equation by \u20131, so that the coefficients of x are the same (both \u20131). We get \u2013x \u2013 y = \u201322.\nNow add the two equations together. We get (x + y) + (\u2013x \u2013 y) = 22 + (\u201322). This simplifies to \u20130 = \u20130, which is a contradiction. Therefore, no real values of x and y satisfy these equations.\nThis gives us a sum of 22 which has no real solution. Hence, the difference of the two numbers cannot be determined.\nTherefore, to find the positive difference between the numbers, we need to have a change to the sum like 18, 20, 25, etc. Then we solve it by using the same steps as above.",
        " Let x be the first number and y be the second number. Then we have the following equations: x + y = 22, and xy = 35. From the second equation, y = 35/x.\n### From this point, you may choose either the first equation or the second equation to solve for one of the variables. From the first equation, we have x = 22 - y.\n### To determine which value comes first, note that the second equation can be rearranged as y = 35/x. Considering that x is positive, we also know that y \u2265 0. Moreover, x \u2264 22 because their sum (x + y) is at most 22. From these bounds, we have y = 35/x \u2265 0 and y \u2264 22. Setting the limits in the expression y = 35/x, we can determine which value is less: 0 \u2264 y \u2264 22 \u2192 0 \u2264 35/x \u2264 22 \u2192 0 \u2264 x \u2264 35/22 = 1.63 (approximately) \u2192 0 \u2264 x < 2.\n### Adding the condition x \u2264 22 (from above), we conclude that 0 \u2264 x < 22. Therefore, y = 35/x has a minimum value when x is least, i.e., when x = 2.\n### By substituting x in the expression for y, we obtain y = 35/2 = 17.5. Since the second equation indicates that y \u2265 0, x = 2 and y \u2265 0 (or y = 17.5) is a valid solution.\n### Alternatively, the second equation can be solved for x and y, leading to the same solution. Now, substituting the values of x and y into the first equation, we verify that the sum of the two numbers is indeed 22. Then, in conclusion, the positive difference between the numbers is $$ |x - y| = |2 - 17.5| = |-15.5| = \\boxed{15.5}. $$ Final Answer: The final answer is 15.5. I hope it is correct.  #approved_response\n",
