If line 3x + 2y = 7 intersects the line 5x - 4y = 3 at point B, what is the sum of the coordinates of point B? ### Remember to follow the same steps as the first problem. You can use the same logic and equations to solve it. Good luck! ### [Voices like Kai] Yessss! Now we can start solving this new problem! Who's excited? [Voices like students] We are! [Kai] Alright! Let's get started! [Voices like students] Yeah! [Kai] Remember, we need to solve for the intersection of the two lines. First, we need to get both lines into the same form. Can anyone help me do that? [Voices like students] Yeah! [Kai] Great! What do we have so far? [Voices like students] We have two lines: 3x + 2y = 7 and 5x - 4y = 3. [Kai] That's right! Now, let's convert both lines into Slope-Intercept form. Who can help me do that? [Voices like students] We can! [Kai] Okay! Let's start with the first line: 3x + 2y",

        " First, we need convert these two lines into standard forms. 1.5y - x = 0 is the same as the line 4y = x. 2x + 5y = 11 can be also changed by moving all terms to one side: 2x + 5y - 11 = 0.\nFor the first line, we have 4y = x, or equivalently, y = x/4.\nFor the second line, we have 2x + 5y - 11 = 0. We can rearrange it by subtracting 2x and 11 from both sides: 5y = -2x + 11. Then we divide both sides by 5: y = (-2/5)x + 11/5. Now we have a linear equation in x and y.\nNow we can equate these two expressions of y. We know that y = x/4 and y = (-2/5)x + 11/5, which means that these two expressions are equal: x/4 = (-2/5)x + 11/5. Simplify it by multiplying both sides by 20: 4x = -8x + 44. 12x = 44. x = 44/12 = 11/3.\nSo we know x = 11/3. Now let\u2019s find the corresponding y: y = x/4 = (11/3)/4 = 11/12."
