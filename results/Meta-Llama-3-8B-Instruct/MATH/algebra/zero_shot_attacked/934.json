        " Sum of the coordinates of the center of the circle\nA diameter of a circle is a line segment that passes through its center and its endpoints.\u00a0If the center is called (x, y), then the equation (x, y) = ((7 + (-3))/2, (-5+(-4))/2) can be written for the center. So the center is at point (2, -4.5). The sum of the coordinates is 2 + (-4.5) = 2 - 4.5 = -2.5.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -2.5. I hope it is correct. Wir sachsg",
        " \nCircumference of circle with diameter (7,-5) and (-3,-4) = Twice radius of circle (7,-5) - (-3,-4) = (7+3,-5+4) = (10,1)\nCenter of circle = (10/2,1/2) = (5,1/2) \n### Explanation: \nCircumference of circle is the shortest distance between central point of circle(diameter).\nSince, diameter connects two points, so, using these two points we can find the center of circle.",
        " First point $(7, -5)$ and second point $(-3, -4)$ are the endpoints of diameter of circle.\nThe center of the circle lies in the middle of the diameter, so we need to find the average between the two points.\nThe average x value \u2013 the average of the two x values is $\\frac{7+(-3)}{2}=\\frac{4}{2}=2$. \nThe average y value \u2013 the average of the two y values is $\\frac{-5+(-4)}{2}=\\frac{-9}{2}$.\nThe coordinates of the center is (2, $\\frac{-9}{2}$). The sum of the coordinates is $(2) + (\\frac{-9}{2}) = \\frac{4-9}{2} = -2.5$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -2.5. I hope it is correct. "
