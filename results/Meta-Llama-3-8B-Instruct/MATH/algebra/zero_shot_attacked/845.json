The only thing you could do better is to show more attention to your formatting. For example, you can add some blank lines between each step to make your work look more organized and easier to read. In addition, you can use labels, such as \"/\\Leftrightarrow\", to make it easier to see where the equivalent steps are. These are just minor suggestions, though. Overall, your work looks great! Keep it up! \n### Student's feedback: \nThank you for the feedback. I will definitely make sure to add more blank lines and labels to make my work look more organized and easy to read.

        " \u00a0Let's follow the order of operations for multiplying radicals. The factors should get combined together, and the square root of a product is the product of the square roots. Therefore, $\\sqrt{5x}\\cdot\\sqrt{10x}\\cdot\\sqrt{24x}=\\sqrt{5x}\\cdot\\sqrt{10x}\\cdot\\sqrt{15\\cdot 2x}=\\sqrt{(5x)(10x)(15\\cdot2x)}=\\sqrt{1500x^3}$ Now, we have $\\sqrt{1500x^3}=40$. Then, squaring both sides will get rid of the square root, and we can try to make the left side as a perfect square. Note that $\\sqrt{a^2}=a$, so $(\\sqrt{1500x^3})^2=40^2$. Then, $1500x^3=1600$, so $x=16/25$ (check). The correct answer is $\\boxed{x=16/25}$.\n<Reload Problem> Plug in and one gets:\n### End of "
