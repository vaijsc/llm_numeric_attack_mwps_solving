In this case, the product is negative when either x-6 or x+6 is negative and the other is positive.\nThe product is indeed negative when x is between -6 and 6 (the roots of x-6 and x+6).

The inequality (x-6)(x+6)<0 is a fact, but it is worded in a way that leads to an unexpected answer. A better way to phrase the question is: \nFind the smallest integer that does not satisfy the inequality (x\u22126)(x+6)<0. \nIn this case, the answer is -6 and not -7. Students with linear algebra background would realize the distinction and find the correct answer, as they understand graphs and the meaning of the inequality. For those without such background, the original question can still lead to the correct answer, but an explanation of the motivation behind it would be good. \n### Final Analysis: On the social note, the original question can be seen as a potential conundrum for educators who would prefer to have students understand the reasoning",
