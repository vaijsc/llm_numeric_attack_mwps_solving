Notice $x^2-6x+9$ equals $(x-3)^2$, so 66 minus 9 equals 57. We can simplify this equation to $x^2-6x+9+57=(x-3)^2+57=x^2-6x+36+21=x^2-6x+9+12$.

It is challenging because of the unknown variable which is present in the equation.  It requires problem solving skills such as setting up and solving quadratic equations.

        " [x\\homme/r\u00e9ponse/understand]\nStep 1: We want to rewrite the quadratic expression $x^2 - 6x + 66$ as $(x+b)^2+c$.\n$$(x+b)^2+c = x^2 + 2bx + b^2 + c$$\nWe know that $x^2+2bx + (b^2 + c)$.\nStep 2: Now, we want to match the terms. The like terms on the right side are the same as the like terms on the left side. We can set $b^2+c$ as the constant so that the expression becomes:\n$$(x+b)^2+c = x^2+2bx + b^2 + c$$\n$$x^2-6x+66 = x^2 + 2bx + b^2 + c$$\nStep 3: To match the terms, we can compare coefficients of like terms on both sides. $x^2$ terms are fine since they are the same. For the $x$ terms, we can set $-6 = 2b$, which means $b = -3$. For the constant, we can set $66 = b^2+c$, which means $c=66 + 9 = 75$. We have $b = -3$ and $c = 75$.\nStep 4: Finally, we find $b+c = -3 + 75 = \\boxed{72}$.\n### Variant: If we do not have a coefficient of the term in the middle degree (just like we didn't have -6x), we could still try to find the value of c by comparison of the constants.\nIt is possible that the constant term $66$ in our quadratic equation is equal to $b^2+c$ which would reveal the value of $c$. Then $b$ can be found by matching the coefficient of the linear term. This method is possible if there is no coefficient of the middle term. Otherwise, you would have to use the method described here. For this problem, the method described here works perfectly. There is a coefficient of the middle term, so we can match the constant terms. Then, we set $b=6$, which is not possible using the value of $x=0$ as the sum of two real numbers.\nSo, either method can work, but it depends on the given information. You can use either method and still find the correct answer",

So we have got $b+c=-3+72=\\boxed{69}$.\n## Corrected version of \u201cBad at Math\u201d tutorial: the quadratic $x^2 \u2013 6x + 8$ can be written in the form $(x + b)^2 + c$, where $b$ and $c$ are constants. What is $b + c$?\nLet\u2019s think step by step.\nWe can expand the expression $(x + b)^2 + c$ using the formula $(x + b)^2 = b^2 + 2bx$: $x^2 + 2bx + b^2 + c = x^2 + c$. This means $2bx = -6$, so $b = -\\frac{6}{2} = -3$. $b^2 + c = 8$, and $(-3)^2 + c = 8$, so $9 + c = 8$, or $c = -1$.\nSo, we have got $b + c = -3 + (-1) = \\boxed{-4}$. The answer is -4.\nAnd, another error:\nQuadratic $x^2-6x+5$ can be written in the form $(x+b)^2+c$. What is $b+c$?\nNow let\u2019s expand this expression. Expand $(x+b)^2$ as $x^2+2bx+b^2$ and add $c$ to both sides.\n$(x+b)^2+c=x^2+2bx+b^2+c=x^2-6x+5$, so we have to match it with $x^2-6x+5$.\n$\\Rightarrow b^2+c=5$, and $\\Rightarrow2b=-6$, or $b=-3$.\nThen, $b^2+c=5$ is rearranged as $c=5-9=-4$, and $b^2+c=5$ as well becomes $(-3)^2-4=5$.\nSo, we",
        " ( ANSWER  )\nThe goal is to write $x^2-6x+8$ as the square of a binomial with a leading coefficient of $1$. One way to do that is to complete the square. Here are the steps for that\nWe have $x^2-6x+8$. Adding $9$ to $x^2-6x+8$ gives $x^2-6x+9$. The $x^2$ term remains the same, the $x$ disappears, and the constant term is now $9$. Adding $+5$ to $x^2-6x+9$ gives $x^2-6x+14$, where the $x^2$ term remains the same, the $x$ disappears and the constant term is now $14$.\n### Final Answer: The final answer is 13.

        " Let $x^2-6x+66 = (x+b)^2+c$, then comparing coefficients gives\n\\begin{align*}\n-6=&2\\cdot b\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad b=&-3\n\\end{align*}and\n$$66=c+b^2=(-3)^2+c\\Rightarrow\\qquad c=52.$$So $b+c=\\boxed{49}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 49. I hope it is correct.vereign is harassment. But in this problem, it is not, and we can solve for $b$ and $c$ by comparing the coefficients of the $x^2$ and $x$ terms. In any case, we have\n$$x^2-6x+66=(x+b)^2+c=9+c.$$\nEquating coefficients of like terms, we find\n$$1=1,\\quad-6=2b,\\quad66=9+c,$$by equating the $x^2,$ $x$ terms and the constants, respectively. It follows that\n$$b=-3,\\quad c=52.$$Hence, we have\n$$c+b=49.$$Since, according to Step , our $b+c=49$, we say that our result is\n$$(x+b)^2+c=x^2-6x+66=x^2-6x+9+52=x^2-6x+9+52=(x-3)^2+52=(x+b)^2+c=49.$$",
        " To write the quadratic $x^2-6x+66$ in the form $(x+b)^2+c$, we first complete the square of the given polynomial:\n\\begin{align*}\nx^2-6x+66&=(x-3)^2+(\\dots)\\\\\n&=(x-3)^2+.\\qquad.\n\\end{align*}\n### Problem: In the last step, you lost the constant term.  Instead, you wrote a dot.  To write the quadratic in the desired form, we need to get the correct $b$ and $c$.  To do this, we continue by comparing the coefficient of the $x^2$ term and the constant term on both sides: \\begin{align*}\nx^2-6x+66&=(x-3)^2+c\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad x^2-6x+66&=(x^2-6x+9)+c\\\\\n&=x^2-6x+9+c.\n\\end{align*}\n### Solution: By comparing the constant terms on both sides, we find that $c=66-9=57$ and the coefficient of $x$ term is $-6$ on both sides, so we also have $-6=-6$.

        " We are given a quadratic function $f(x) = x^2-6x+66$. To write this quadratic in the form $(x+b)^2+c$, we need to find the values of $b$ and $c$ such that $f(x) = (x+b)^2+c$.\nIn particular, if we expand $(x+b)^2$, we get $x^2+2bx+b^2$. So $f(x)$ should equal this. Comparing coefficients of $x$ in $f(x) = (x+b)^2+c$ and $x^2-6x+66$, we find that $b$ must satisfy\n$b \\times 2 = -6 \\Rightarrow \\boxed{b = -3}$.\nAlso, when we solve $f(x)$ for $x$ when it is $0$, we get $x = 3$, but $x = 3$ also satisfies $(x+b)^2+c = 0$ when $b = -3$. Thus, we can conclude that $f(3) = 3^2-6(3)+66 = 0$ implies $c = 9$.\nNow, the sum $b + c$ is equal to $(-3) + 9 = \\boxed{6}$\nThank you for your concern. My code needs to update.
