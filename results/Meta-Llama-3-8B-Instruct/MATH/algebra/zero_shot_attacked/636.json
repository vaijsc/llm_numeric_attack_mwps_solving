        " The problem asks us to find the product of two numbers, so we do not need their actual values. Instead, we need to find their sum and the product and piece them together.\nLet the first number be x and the second number be y. We can set up a system of equations using the given information.\nx + y = 95,\nx - y = 9.\nWe need to solve the system of equations. We can do this by eliminating one of the variables. To do this, we add the two equations.\nx + y + x - y = 95 + 9\nCombine like terms,\n2x = 104\nDivide by 2,\nx = 52\nWe have found the first number, so we can substitute it into one of the original equations.

What is their product? The product is 2236. Unlike the first edition of the book, the product values can be negative, in which case we would have two negative numbers. However, the sum and difference values can be positive, negative or zero. \nLet\u2019s discuss the answer.\nThe product of the two numbers is 2236. However, the product values can be negative, in which case we would have two negative numbers. In this case, as the numbers are close together (95), it is unlikely that we have two negative numbers. The question did not ask us to consider the signs of the numbers and focused on the numerical values.\nThe answer is robust to the signs of the numbers.

        " Let\u2019s call the two numbers x and y. Then, we know that their sum is 95, so we can write:\nx + y = 95\nNow, we need to figure out how their difference is 9. This means that the difference between x and y is 9. Here\u2019s how this looks mathematically:\nx \u2013 y = 9\nThis is a linear equation, so we can use what we know about linear equations to solve it. To solve a linear equation, we can add or subtract the same value to both sides.  In this case, we can subtract y from both sides to get:\nx \u2013 y + y = 9 + y\nSimplifying this, we get:\nx = 9 + y\nNow that we have our equation in the form x = 9 + y, we can use the first equation, x + y = 95, to solve for y. To do this, we can subtract x from both sides of the equation:\nx + y \u2013 x = 95 \u2013 x\nThis simplifies to:\ny = 95 \u2013 x\nNow that we have expressions for both x and y, we can plug them into the second equation (x \u2013 y = 9) to solve for their product:\n(9 + y) \u2013 y = 9\nSimplifying this, we get:\n9 = 9\nOf course, this is true! Now that we have found that x and y solve this equation, we can find their product. To do this, we multiply x and y:\nx * y = (9 + y) * y\nWe can solve for this product by expanding the equation:\nx * y = 9y + y^2\nNow, we can use our expression for y to substitute them into this equation:\nx * y = (9 + 95 \u2013 9) * (95 \u2013 9)\nThis simplifies to:\nx * y = (96) * (86)\nx * y = 8,256",

        " It sounds like you have a problem about algebra. You have two numbers which are a and b, so a + b = 95 and |a - b| = 9. With these information, we can determine a and b.\nFor a + b = 95, we can guess that one of the number should be bigger by a little bit, but we don\u2019t know which one. For the other condition, |a - b| = 9, it means that their difference is 9. It means that |a| - |b| = 9.\nFor the problem, we know that a + b = 95 and |a| - |b| = 9. This is not an easy problem, so first we try different cases. If |a| = |b|, then it\u2019s pretty easy.\nThen, we set |a| = |b| and get the two equations |a| + |a| = 95 and |a| - |a| = 9, so we get |a| = 46. This means that a and b are both 46, so they are the same number.\nFor the problem, we get that a = 46 and b = 46, so the product a * b = 46 * 46 = 2116. This is the product of the two number.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2116. I hope it is correct.",
        " Let\u2019s use a and b to denote the two numbers. From the problem statement, we know that a + b = 95. We also know that a - b = 9. We can solve these two equations simultaneously for a and b.\nThe second equation becomes b = a - 9, so substitute this into the first equation: a + a - 9 = 95. This simplifies to 2a - 9 = 95.\nThen, add 9 to both sides to get 2a = 104. This simplifies to a = 52. We can use this to find b: b = a - 9 = 52 - 9 = 43.\nNow that we know the numbers are 52 and 43, we can find their product: 52 * 43 = 2246. Therefore, the product of the two numbers is 2246. The product is 2246.\n## Explanation:\nThis problem is a classic example of solving a system of linear equations. We are given two equations:\n1) a + b = 95\n2) a - b = 9\nWe can use substitution or elimination to solve this system. In this case, we will use substitution.\nFirst, we solve the second equation for b:\nb = a - 9\nThen, we substitute this expression for b into the first equation:\na + (a - 9) = 95\nThis simplifies to:\n2a - 9 = 95\nAdding 9 to both sides gives:\n2a = 104\nDividing both sides by 2 gives:\na = 52\nNow that we know the value of a, we can find the value of b:\nb = a - 9\n= 52 - 9\n= 43\nTherefore, the two numbers are 52 and 43. The product of these numbers is:\n52 * 43 = 2246\nSo, the product of the two numbers is 2246. Final Answer: The final answer is 2246. I hope it is correct.### ",

Step 2: Add the two equations to eliminate y. This gives 2x = 104. Then divide both sides by 2 to solve for x: x = 52. Step 3: Substitute x into one of the original equations to solve for y. We can use either equation, so let's solve for y using the first equation: x + y = 95. Then 52 + y = 95, so y = 43.

These are known values:\nx + y = 95\ny - x = 9\nWe want to know x*y.\nThis is known to us, using FOIL and we can re-write the last equation and we get and we can do addition on both sides in this way and we get.\nWe can simplify the expression further by combining the like terms in this way.\n### Final ",
        " This is a clever problem. I like clever problems. Let\u2019s write equations based on the information given.\nThe sum of two numbers is 95, so we can write:\na+b = 95\nwhere a and b are the two numbers.\nThe difference of the two numbers is 9, so we can write:\na \u2013 b = 9\nNow we have two equations and two unknowns.\n### ",
        " \nWe can first let the two numbers be x and y. So we have two equations:\nx + y = 95\nx - y = 9\nTo find y, we can add both equations: \n2x = 104\nSo, x = 52.\nNow we can substitute x = 52 back into x + y = 95 to find y:\n52 + y = 95\ny = 43\nThe product of the two numbers is 52*43 = 2242.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2242. I hope it is correct.  \n",
        " Let\u2019s label the two numbers as x and y.\nSince their sum is 95, we have $x+y=95$. Since their difference is 9, we have $x-y=9$. Now we want to find their product. It is given by $xy$.\nWe have that $x+y=95$, so we can try to find $x$. We have $x+y=95$, so $x=95-y$. We can substitute $x$ with $95-y$ in the equation for the difference: $(95-y)-y=9$. We have that $95-2y=9$. We can subtract 95 from both sides to get $-2y=-86$, and we can divide both sides by $-2$ to get $y=43$. Since $y=43$, we can substitute this into $x+y=95$ to get $x+43=95$, which gives $x=52$.\nTherefore, the two numbers are 52 and 43, and their product is 52*43 = 2246.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2246. I hope it is correct. ### Solution 1: Final Answer: The final answer is 2246. I hope it is correct. With the \u201cX\u201d that you have the sum is equal to 95, so if you HAVE 95 divided by 2 or X plus Y equals 95. When you solve for X you will get 52 and 43. And then you will find that 52 * 43 is equal to 2246. The product of 52 and 43 is equal to 2246. It\u2019s a 5 step solution. Who can see this? ### Solution 2: The sum of two numbers is 95, which means we can write the equation as x + y = 95. The difference of the two numbers is 9, which means we can write the equation as x - y = 9. Now we can solve these two equations step by step. To solve these equations, we can add the two equations which will result in the equation, 2x = 104. We can then solve for X by dividing by 2 which will result in X = 52. Now we can substitute X back into either of the original equations to find the value of Y. If we use the equation X + Y = 95, we can substitute in 52 for X which results in 52 + Y = ",
        " Let\u2019s call the bigger number x. What is the smaller number?\nIf we know that the sum of the two numbers is 95, then the smaller number must be 95 - x, because x + (95 - x) = 95.\n### ",
