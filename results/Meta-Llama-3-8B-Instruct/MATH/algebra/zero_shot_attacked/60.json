        " \nOur goal is to find the value of $x$ that gives the minimum value for the given quadratic expression $x^2-8x+3$.\nWe will start by expanding the expression $$x^2-8x+3$$to $$x^2-8x+16-16+3=x^2-8x+16-13.$$Now, we see that the expression is of the form $x^2-ax+b$, which is either maximum or minimum depending on whether $a<0$ or $a>0$, respectively. In our case, we have $a=8>0$, which means that the expression will be minimum. \nBut, we cannot simply say that the minimum value occurs when $x=0$, because for any quadratic expression, there will always be a point where it is minimized. The question asks us for the specific value $x$ that will give the minimum value. We know that to minimize the quadratic expression $x^2-ax+b$, it will happen at the vertex of the parabola $y=x^2-ax+b$, which is $x=-\\dfrac{a}{2}=-\\dfrac{-8}{2}=\\boxed{4}$. For $x=4$, we can check that the expression indeed yields a minimum by evaluating $y=(4)^2-8(4)+3=16-32+3=-13$, which is indeed the minimum value achieved.\n### Prefer.)  Larger version:\nWe'll go through this step by step.\n**1. Expand the quadratic expression ** \nWe have $$x^2 - 8x + 3,$$which is a quadratic expression of the form $ax^2+bx+c$. To expand it, we need to multiply out the parentheses $$x^2 - 8x + 3=(x^2-8x)+(3)=x^2 - 8x + 16-16+3=x^2 - 8x + 16-13.$$So, we have $$x^2 - 8x + 3=x^2 - 8x + 16-13.$$\n**2. Identify the value of $a$ ** \nNow, we can write the expression in the standard form of a quadratic equation: $$x^2 - 8x + 16-13.$$\nIn this form, $a$ is the coefficient of the $x^2$ term, which is $1",
        " We can complete the square to write $$x^2-8x+3=(x-4)^2-11.$$If we want to minimize $(x-4)^2-11$, we can do so by making $(x-4)^2$ as small as possible, which is zero. This is achieved when $x=4$. Therefore, the value of $x$ which gives the minimum value for $x^2 - 8x + 3$ is $\\boxed{4}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 4. I hope it is correct.ewis",
        " Given the equation $x^2-8x+3$ (just say that out loud, $x-two times x plus 3$), we can first factor it into $(x-3)(x-1)$. So the value of $x$ which gives the minimum value for $x^2-8x+3$ would be between 3 and 1. But $(x-1)(x-3)$ has a minimum value when $x$ is equal to 2, at that point both terms in the parentheses would be zero. So $\\boxed{2}$ is the value of $x$ which gives the minimum value for the given expression.\n#### Counterexample: If we choose $x = 2$, then $x^2 - 8x + 3 = 2^2 - 8(2) + 3 = 4 - 16 + 3 = -9$.

        " $x=\\boxed{4}$\nSince the problem asks for the minimal value, we must find the vertex of the parabola.  The parabola is of the form $f(x)=x^2-8x+3$; hence, we must first convert that to the standard vertex form $f(x)=(x-h)^2+k$ by completing the square.\n$$x^2-8x+3=x^2-8x+4^2+3-4^2=(x-4)^2-15.$$As $f(x)=(x-h)^2+k$, we know the vertex occurs at $(4, -15)$.  Hence, the minimum value occurs when $x=4$.  When we plug it into the quadratic equation, we indeed see that the resulting value is the minimum.  Thus, the minimum value is $\\boxed{4}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 4. I hope it is correct.  Another method could be using the derivative.  Set $f(x)=x^2-8x+3$ and find $f'(x)$.  Set $f'(x)=0$ to solve for the critical value.\nTo minimize and maximize the value of a quadratic function $f(x)=ax^2+bx+c$, we set $f'(x)=2ax+b=0$ since the quadratic function can be rewritten as $f(x)=(x-h)^2+k$ and we know that the vertex, and thus the minimum, occurs at $x=h$.\nSo, we have $$2x-8=0\\Rightarrow x=\\boxed{4}.$$Since $f''(x)=2a>0$, we know that the normal parabola opens upwards; thereby, the critical value $x=4$ corresponds to a minimum. When we plug it into the quadratic equation, we indeed see that the resulting value is the minimum.  Thus, the minimum value is $\\boxed{4}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 4.

        " \nFirst, we can factor the expression: $$x^2 - 8x + 3 = (x - 3)(x - 1).$$ Now the question asks about the value of x that gives the minimum value of (x - 3)(x - 1).  Remember, we want the x value where the graph of (x - 3)(x - 1) is at its minimum.  So we can graph it: The parabola is a downward-facing parabola with a vertex at x = 2.  So the value of x, where the parabola is at its minimum, is x = 2.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2. I hope it is correct. How to draw the graph? How to understand the factorization is enough? Can I try using calculus method as well? Of course! It's always good to have multiple methods.",
        " 4\nHere is the full explanation.\nThe expression $x^2 - 8x + 3$ is actually in the form $(x - a)^2 + b$. Recall that the minimum value of the expression $(x-a)^2$ occurs when $x = a$. This minimum value is $0$ (actually, it is $0$ because the expression $x^2$ has one critical point). Therefore, to find the minimum value of $x^2-8x+3$, we can find the value $a$ such that $x^2-8x+3=(x-a)^2$. Now $$(x-a)^2=x^2-2ax+a^2,$$ so we have $$x^2-8x+3=x^2-2ax+a^2\\Rightarrow-2ax+3=a^2.$$ Comparing the coefficients of $x$, we get $a=4$. It follows that when $x=4$ the expression $x^2-8x+3$ attains its minimum value of $\\boxed{3}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 4. I hope it is correct. I was able to derive the minimum value, but I was not able to get the minimum value correctly. But I was able to find that the final answer is 4. I'm hoping it's correct.

        " Hint: Minimum value of a parabola always occurs at the vertex. Vertex is at the point ($x=\\frac{-b}{a}$), where $a$ is the coefficient of the $x^2$ term and $b$ is the coefficient of the $x$ term. Plugging the value of $x$ into the original equation will give the minimum value. x^2 - 8x + 3 = (x - 4)^2 - 11.\nSo, the minimum value of $x^2 - 8x + 3$ is -11, and it occurs at the vertex, which is $x=4$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 4.

        " (Note: write the answer in the form $a + bi$ , if it is in complex numbers.)\nFirst, we should recognize that this is a quadratic function. Every quadratic function can be written in the form $ax^2 + bx + c$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants, in this case $a = 1$, $b = -8$, $c = 3$. The vertex of the quadratic function will be at the point $(-b / 2a , c - (b^2 / 4a))$.  In this case, $-b / 2a = 4$ and $c - (b^2 / 4a) = 3 - 16 = -13$.

        " The minimum value occurs when the derivative is zero: (x^2 \u2013 8x + 3)\u2019 = (2x \u2013 8) \\Rightarrow 2x \u2013 8 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 4 So the minimum value of x^2-8x+3 occurs when x = 4. Final Answer: The final answer is 4. I hope it is correct. I ###### Hint 1: The function is a quadratic function in terms of x, and its minimum is achieved when it is equal to zero. To find the value of x at which this happens, we take the derivative of the function, set it equal to zero, and solve for x. Hint 2: When we take the derivative of the function, we will get a linear function in terms of x, which we can then set equal to zero and solve for x. Hint 3: The result of taking the derivative of the function is a linear function in terms of x. When we set it equal to zero, we can use simple algebra to solve for x. Your turn! What value of x makes the minimum of the quadratic function? ###### Step-by-Step Solution:\nStep 1: Take the derivative of the function.\n(x^2 \u2013 8x + 3)\u2019 = (2x \u2013 8)\nStep 2: Set the derivative equal to zero and solve for x.\n(2x \u2013 8) = 0\nStep 3: Solve for x.\n2x = 8\nx = 4\nTherefore, the minimum value of the function x^2-8x+3 occurs when x = 4. ###### Final Answer: The final answer is 4.
