        " First, it is necessary to calculate the combined weight of the smaller two dogs. We know the difference between the larger weight and the smaller weight is 20 pounds, let the smaller weight be x, then the larger weight is x + 20. So the combined weight of the smaller two dogs is 2x. Then, we know that 2x + (x + 20) = 285, can be written as 3x + 20 = 285. Subtract 20 from both sides, get 3x = 265, get x = 265/3 = 88.33. So, the smaller two dogs weigh 88.33 pounds each. The largest dog weighs x + 20 = 88.33 + 20 = 108.33 pounds.\n___________\nLet's try to solve the problem step by step.\nFirst, let the smaller weight be x. Then, the larger weight is x + 20, because the difference between the larger weight and the smaller weight is 20 pounds.\nWe know the combined weight of the three dogs is 285 pounds. So, the combined weight of the smaller two dogs is 2x. Then, we can write an equation: 2x + (x + 20) = 285.\nNow, we can simplify the equation: 2x + x + 20 = 285, 3x + 20 = 285.\nNext, we subtract 20 from both sides: 3x + 20 - 20 = 285 - 20, 3x = 265.\nFinally, we divide both sides by 3: 3x / 3 = 265 / 3, x = 88.33.\nSo, the smaller two dogs weigh 88.33 pounds each. To find the weight of the largest dog, we add 20 pounds to the smaller weight: x + 20 = 88.33 + 20 = 108.33 pounds.\nTherefore, the largest dog weighs 108.33 pounds.",
        " \n#### The largest dog + 2 smaller dogs = 285 pounds.\n#### The difference between the largest dog and the two smaller dogs is 20 pounds. \n#### So the largest dog\u2019s weight = 2 x smaller dog\u2019s weight + 20.\n#### 2 x smaller dog\u2019s weight is the same, say x.\n#### So, largest dog's weight = x + x + 20 = 285.\n#### 2x + 20 = 285.\n#### Subtract 20 from both sides: 2x = 265.\n#### Divide both sides by 2: x = 132.5.\n#### So the largest basset hound weighs 132.5 + 20 = **152.5 pounds**.

        " Imagine that the weights are A, B, and C for the 3 dogs in order of largest to smallest.  So, A > B > C.\nWe know that A (largest dog) - B (second largest dog) = 20 pounds.  So A = B + 20.  We also know that B and C (smallest dog) weigh the same.  So B = C.\nSo now we have C (smallest dog, A (largest dog with B + 20) and C are given as B. C and B are combined to get B (littlest dog + medium dog).\nWe know that A + B + C = 285 pounds.  Since we can substitute out C in the A + B + C equation as A-B, we get:\nA + (A - B - 20) + B = 285 pounds\nCombine like terms A = A 2B 20 285\nSubtract 285 from both sides, 2B - 20 = 0\nAdd 20 to both sides, 2B = 20\nDivide both sides by 2, B = 10\nSo now we know B or C (they are the same) is 10 pounds and B is A - 20.  A = 30 + 20 = 50\nSo A (the largest dog) is 50 pounds.\n### Final Answer: The final answer is 50. I hope it is correct.  50 pounds is the heaviest dog.  Smaller one is 10 pounds.

        " Let the weights of two smaller basset hounds be S. Then, we have the following equations:\nS + S + L = 285  L - S = 20  Solve for L using these two equations.\nLet's first solve L - S = 20: Substitute the value of S from the first equation into the second equation:\nL - (285 - L) = 20  L - 285 + L = 20  2L - 285 = 20  2L = 305  L = 152.5\nNow use L = 152.5 in the first equation to solve for S:\nS + S + 152.5 = 285  2S + 152.5 = 285  2S = 132.5  S = 66.25\nThe largest basset hound weighs L = 152.5 pounds. The largest basset hound weighs **152.5 pounds**.\n### Alternative Approach: \nThe weight of the largest dog is the total weight minus the weights of the two smaller dogs.

        " Let\u2019s call the weight of the 2 smaller dogs p. Then the weight of the largest dog is p + 20. The total weight of the 3 dogs is 285, so you can set up an equation: p + p + (p+20) = 285. 3p + 20 = 285. Now subtract 20 from both sides. 3p = 265. Now divide both sides by 3. p = 88. Now that you know the smaller dogs weigh 88 pounds each, you can find the weight of the largest dog. p + 20 = 108. So the largest dog weighs 108 pounds.\n### Alternative Solution:\n1. Let\u2019s suppose that the smaller dogs weigh the same, let\u2019s call them x.\n2. The difference between the larger and smaller dogs is 20 pounds, so the larger dog weighs x + 20.\n3. The sum of the weights of the smaller dogs and the larger dog is 285 pounds. So, we can set up the equation: 2x + (x + 20) = 285.\n4. Group the terms with the variables together: 3x + 20 = 285.\n5. Subtract 20 from both sides: 3x = 265.\n6. Finally, divide both sides by 3: x = 88.\nSo the smaller dogs weigh 88 pounds each, and the larger dog weighs 88 + 20 = 108 pounds.\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions. \ud83d\ude0a\n### ",
        " The two smaller basset hounds weigh the same. Let\u2019s call their combined weight $x$. Since they are the same weight, $x$ / $2$ is the weight of each. The combined weight of the three basset hounds needs to be 285 pounds, so $x$ / $2 + x$ / $2 + \\left(Largest Dog\\right)$ = 285.\n### Step 2:\nFirst, let\u2019s take out $x$ / $2$ on the left side: $x + x + \\left(Largest Dog\\right)$ = 285. Add the $x$ / $2$\u2019s together: $2x + \\left(Largest Dog\\right)$ = 285.\n### Step 3:\nTo solve for the largest dog\u2019s weight, subtract $2x$ from both sides. $2x + \\left(Largest Dog\\right)$ \u2013 $2x$ = 285 \u2013 $2x$. Common sense tells us to divide $2x$ by $2$. That is the same as multiplying by $1/2$. We get $\\left(Largest Dog\\right)$ = 285 \u2013 $2x$. This means we need to subtract the combined weight of the smaller basset hounds, which is $x$. Subtract $x$ from both sides: $\\left(Largest Dog\\right)$ = 285 \u2013 $2x$ \u2013 $x$. $\\left(Largest Dog\\right)$ = 285 \u2013 $3x$.\n### Step 4:\nNow we know that the difference between the largest dog and the smaller dog is 20 pounds. $3x$ does not make sense for this difference. Let\u2019s try $x + 20$ instead. It makes more sense as the difference. So, we have this equation:\n$3x$ = $\\left(Largest Dog\\right)$ \u2013 $\\left(First Smaller Dog\u2019s Weight\\right)$\nWe can plug $x + 20$ for the large dog\u2019s weight: $x + 20$ = $\\left(Largest Dog\\right)$\n### Step 5:\nNow we have a new task: solve for the smallest dog\u2019s weight. $3x$ = $x + 20$. Subtract $x$ from both sides: $2x$ = $20$. Divide both sides by $2$: $x$ = $10$. Recall that $x$ is the weight of each smaller basset hound, so each smaller",
        " \nThe robot will help you solve this question.\nLet\u2019s assign letters to the three dogs. Let B be the largest dog, and let A and C be the two smaller ones. Therefore, A = C. The difference between the largest and the smallest is 20, so B - A = 20. Similarly, the total of the three dogs is 285, so B + A + C = 285. Since A = C, we can substitute A into the equations, so B - C = 20, and B + C + C = 285. Simplify the equations: B - C = 20 becomes B = 20 + C. Simplify B + 2C = 285, become B = 285 - 2C. Substitute B = 20 + C into the last equation, then 20 + C = 285 - 2C, then 3C = 265, and finally C = 265 \u00f7 3 = 88.33, and B = 20 + 88.33 = 108.33.\nThe largest dog is B which weighs 108.33 pounds.\n### Solution: \nThe total weight of the two smaller dogs is 285 - 108.33 = 176.67. The difference between the larger and smaller dogs is 20, so the two smaller dogs weigh the same. The larger dog weighs 108.33 pounds. The two smaller dogs weigh 88.33 pounds each. These figures are more reliable. That is the intention. Let\u2019s assign letters to the two dogs. Assign letters to two dogs. Larger dogs B, smaller dogs A and C. The weights of A and C are similar. The difference between the larger and smaller dogs is 20, so B and A are 20. Similarly, the total weight of the three dogs is 285, so B, A, and C are 285. Since A = C, there is parallel movement.\nSimplify the formula B = A + 20.\nB = A + 20 and B + 2A = 285. Simplify the formula B = 285 - 2A and B = A 285 - 2A and a B = A + 20 become 285 - 2A = A + 20 and 285 - 2A = A + 20. Simplify 3A = 265 and C = 265 \u00f7 3 = 88.33, and the B becomes the",
        " We can start by letting E be the weight of the smaller dog. What we know is that both smaller dogs weigh E pounds. So we can say that the combined weight of the two smaller dogs is 2E, which is two times the weight of the smaller dog. And the main dog we know its weight is just 285 minus 2E, because we have to 2 smaller dogs weight of E, and the big one its 285 minus that. So we need to solve an equation. We can. 285 is the combined weight of the three, is two E plus the big dog. So what we know that, and we know the difference between other smaller and he is 20 pounds. So we know the big dog is E plus 20. So we have finally have an equation where the two sides of the equation are equal. We can change this to have this side E plus 20, E plus 20 minus all this to the right side of the equation. And we have, the equation becomes E plus 20 equals 285 minus 2E. Let\u2019s simplification. E plus 20 equals 285 minus 2E, so that is 285, minus this E minus this E, that is minus 3E. 20 plus minus 3E. Then if we add three E to both sides of the equation, we have E plus 20 plus E, plus E equals what\u2019s left on the right side. So we add 20 to this side, 20 plus 20 equals 40, we have 20 plus 20 is 40. And add 3E to each side is in the end, it will give us simply 4E. 4E equals 285 minus 20. We simplify this on the right side 285 minus 20, it is 265. So, 4E equals 265. Well, we don\u2019t want to solve 4E, we want to solve E. So we divide both sides of the equation by 4. So we have E is 265 divided by 4, this is 66.5, approximately. So the smallest one is 66.5 pounds. 20 pounds. The largest one is E, plus 20. E is 66.5. So we add 20 to it, add 20, we have 66.5 plus 20, 20 is 20, it\u2019s a 20-pound difference. Anyways, we know that ",
        " The difference between the larger and the smaller is 20 pounds. This means the larger must be 20 pounds more than the smaller, so if the smaller dog weighs $x$ pounds, the larger dog weighs $x+20$ pounds. That makes the total for the two smaller dogs $2x$. The total for all three dogs is 285 pounds, so\n\\begin{align*}\n2x+(x+20)&=285\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad3x+20&=285\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad3x&=265\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x&=89\n\\end{align*}\n### Certificate my Quick ",
        " We can break down the problem as follows:\nLet\u2019s think step by step.\n1. The combined weight of the three dogs is 285 pounds. So, we can write an equation: Larger + Smaller + Smaller = 285, where Larger is the weight of the large dog, Smaller is the weight of the two smaller dogs.\n2. The difference between the larger and smaller weights is 20 pounds. This means that Larger - Smaller = 20. We can add Smaller to both sides of this equation to get Larger = Smaller + 20.\n3. We can substitute the expression Larger = Smaller + 20 into the first equation: (Smaller + 20) + Smaller + Smaller = 285. Combining like terms, we get 3*Smaller + 20 = 285.\n4. We can subtract 20 from both sides to get 3*Smaller = 265. Dividing both sides by 3, we find that Smaller = 265/3 = 88.333 pounds (or approximately 88.33 pounds).\n5. Now that we know Smaller, we can find Larger: Larger = Smaller + 20 = 88.33 + 20 = 108.33 pounds.\n#### Final Answer: The largest dog weighs 108.33 pounds. I hope it is correct. ",
