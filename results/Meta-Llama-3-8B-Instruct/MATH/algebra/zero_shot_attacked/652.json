        " We first note that the equation $y=k$ is a horizontal line, which has no $x$ dependence, and therefore it is invariant under reflection. Hence, we must have that $f=k$ and $e=-2k$. After reflection, $k$ becomes the $y$-intercept and the vertex remains unchanged.  The fact that the $y$-intercept does not change shows that $c=k$, and since the vertex remains unchanged, $h$ remains unchanged as well.\nWe know that, in order for the reflection to preserve the shape of the parabola, the reflection must have the property that it results in a flipped parabola with a mirrored quadratic equation. Hence, we note that after reflection, the vertex and $y$-intercept swap, and so, we may set $a$ as $\\frac{d}{4-k}$ and $b$ as $\\frac{e}{2-k}$. By substituting $e$ as $-2k$, and $f$ as $k$, we obtain that $b=-k$ and $a=\\frac{d}{4-k}$. After plugging in $k$, the sum of $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$, $e$, and $f$ is equal to $a+b+c+d+e+f=\\frac{d}{4-k}-k+k+\\frac{d}{4-k}+2k+k=2d$.\nHowever, this does not answer the problem completely, because we still need to figure out the value of $d$. Therefore, the problem requires that we model the vertex $h$ and $k$ in terms of $a$ and $b$. To do that, we can expand the given equation and then use the vertex formula: $$y=ax^2+bx+c$$$$=a\\left(x^2-2\\cdot\\frac{b}{2a}x+\\left(\\frac{b}{2a}\\right)^2\\right)+c+a\\left(\\left(\\frac{b}{2a}\\right)^2-x^2+2\\cdot\\frac{b}{2a}x\\right)+c$$$$=\\boxed{\\left(x-\\frac{b}{2a}\\right)^2-2ak+c}.$$Thus, combining all our equations, $$a+b+c+d+e+f=2d=\\boxed{2k}$$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2k.

        " We need to find the sum of coefficients for y = ax^2 + bx + c and y = dx^2 +ex + f.\nWe know that for the original parabola the coefficients are a, b, and c. After reflecting it at y=k, the parabola gains an additional y-k on both sides. This means the new parabolic equation will be (y-k) = dx^2+ex+f. Expanding it to y = dx^2+ex+f+k, we need to calculate the new coefficients d, e, and f.\nLet\u2019s calculate the new coefficients:\n1. For the x^2 term: We know c is the constant term. By reflecting c by y = k, it becomes f + k. And for the x^2 term, it remains the same, which is ax^2. So, d = a and f = c.\n2. For the x term: The x term before the reflection is bx. After reflecting it by y = k, it becomes (b - 2*)x, where * is the slope of the line y = k.\nLet us find the slope of the line y = k. The equation of the line is in the slope-intercept form (y = mx + b). As it passes through the point (h, k), its equation is ky = k. Therefore, the line is horizontal, and it has a slope of 0.\nThe x term after the reflection is thus (b) x, which is the same as the original term bx. So, e = b.\n3. The constant term: As we found earlier, f = c.\nNow, adding the original coefficients and the new coefficients:\na + b + c + d + e + f = a + b + c + a + b + c = 2(a + b + c)\nNotice that a+b+c is the sum of the coefficients of the original parabola. This is why we wrote a+b+c as a single term and then multiplied it by 2.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2(a + b + c).

        " We begin by noting that reflecting across the line $y=k$ is equivalent to changing $y$ to $2k-y$ in the equation of the original parabola.

        " \nWe can think about the reflection of the parabola as changing the value of $y$, resulting in a parabola of the same shape but shifted downward by the value of $k$.  First, let's recall what happens if a parabola is reflected about the line $y=k$: the function becomes $y=k+(x-h)^2$, since the parabola is shifted down by the amount $k$ instead of going up.  This means that the new $y$-intercept will be $k$, and the vertex will also be $(h,k)$.  \nRecall that a parabola with equation $y=ax^2+bx+c$ has a $y$-intercept $(0,c)$ and a vertex $(h,k)$.  Therefore, the new parabola has the same shape as the original one, but shifted downward by the amount $k$ to $(0,k)$; i.e., its new equation is $y=a(x-h)^2+k$.  By comparing these two parabolas, we find that $d=a$, $f=k$, $e=-2ah$, and $h=0$.  It can also be shown that $b=-2ak$, by differentiating both sides of the two equations and looking at the derivative.  Adding up the coefficients, we get $a+b+c+d+e+f=a-a+(-2ak)+k=a-k+a-2ak+k=\\boxed{0}$.\n### Final Answer: The final answer is 0. I hope it is correct.  I hope it is correct.  I hope it is correct.

        " \nLet\u2019s begin with the vertices. The vertex of the original parabola is given by $(h,k)$. When we reflect it about the line $y=k$, it will remain the same since the line is the vertical line through the vertex. Therefore, the vertex of the transformed parabola is still $(h,k)$.\nThe new parabola is symmetric about the line $y=k$, meaning it is a reflection of the original parabola about this line. The equation of the line is given by $y=k$, but we know that this line is parallel to the $x$-axis, since we reflected the parabola. This means that the reflection preserves the $y$-intercept, which is $(0,c)$. Therefore, the $y$-intercept of the transformed parabola is $(0,c)$.\nNow, observe that when we reflect a parabola about the $y$-axis, the coefficient of $x^2$ in the equation remains the same, but the $x$- and constant terms change signs. When we reflect about the $y$-axis, we would have $-h$ instead of $h$ in the equation, as the $x$-intercepts change signs. Since we reflect about the line $y=k$, it will flip the equation about the $y$-axis and then translate the parabola to the line $y=k$ by $c$ units. Then, the equation of the transformed parabola is $\\boxed{x^2e+eh+f}$.\n### Final Answer: \nThe final answer is f. I hope it is correct.

We also know that $d=c$, and we only need to find the value of $d+c+e+f$.\nWe started with the equation $y=ax^2+bx+c$, so $a$ is the coefficient of $x^2$, which is $d$. We know that when we",

Reflecting across the horizontal line $y=k$ means that $k$ is the y-coordinate that all the points will move towards; in particular, all the points that move towards $k$ now move up/down the left/right direction. i.e., it is the direct mirror image of the parabola around that line $y=k$.\nSo if the parabola is $y = ax^2 + bx + c$, the new parabola after reflecting about $y = k$ is $y =?$\n### ",
        " The answer is 0. In terms of k, the value of a+b+c+d+e+f is 0.\nHere\u2019s one way to solve the problem. The parabola with equation y=ax^2+bx+c has vertex (h,k). So h must be the x-coordinate of the vertex of y=x^2. This means h=0, k=0. It also means that the equation y=ax^2+bx+c becomes y=ax^2+bx. We are given that the parabola is already reflected about the line y=k. So if we apply that transformation step by step, we get y=ax^2+bx+c becomes y=ax^2+bx+c - k + k = ax^2+bx+c becomes y=ax^2+bx+c+k = a y=a x^2. We notice that a simply doesn\u2019t affect it.

In the last steps of this question, we are given that the vertex is (h,k). Because k exists, it means that it is the line y=k. The vertex (h,k) is always the line y=k. They are the same. but the line y=k is given. It is the line y=k. In the given problem, k=user1 provided, k=k+0=k. The rest of the problem consists of applying the same rule. The result of using reflection is in line with the provided k, which is y = dx^2 + ex + f. Under the same sense of application, we can determine that d + e + f = 0. Regression integration d + e + f likely points to the same line. So they are compatible d + e + f = 0. This line has been described in many ways.

        " $-3k$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -3k. I hope it is correct. I will be happy to help you to write a proof. Let me know if you need that. Let\u2019s first recall that the parabola with equation $y=ax^2+bx+c$ is the graph of $f(x)=ax^2+bx+c$, which has its vertex at $(h,k)$ and its vertex form $$f(x)=a(x-h)^2+k.$$ Taking that the parabola is reflected about the line $y=k$, its new equation is$$\\frac{-a}{a}(x-h)^2+k,$$by the vertical line reflection.  Equating the coefficient of $x^2$ with $d$, we see that $d=-a$.  The parabola then simplifies to $$y=-ax^2+b(-2ah)+k+c,$$by the stretch factor from the reflection in the $x$ direction.  The stretch factor is $\\frac{-a}{a}=-1$.  Thus, we can equate the constant terms and finally get$$f(x)=dx^2+ex+f$$with $d=-a$, $e=-2ah$ and $f=c+k$.  The final desired sum is $$d+e+f=-a+(-2ah)+c+k=-3k,$$by our final value of $d$ and the definition of $k$ being the $y$ coordinate of the vertex.

Therefore, the functions are shifts of each other by $h-h=-h$, and $k+k=2k$, i.e., the two functions are $y = ax^2+bx+c$ and $y=ax^2+(b-2a)x+(c-2k)$.

Since the equation of the original parabola is $y=ax^2+bx+c,$ the equation of the reflected parabola will be $y=k+dx^2+ex+f$, where $(h,k)$ is the vertex of the original parabola and the reflected parabola inherits its vertex cleanly.  This also gives us the value of $k$ as the $y$-coordinate of the vertex of the original parabola (so $k$ is the value of $c$).\nWe know that $(h,k)$ is the vertex of the original parabola.  Since the equation of the original parabola is $y=ax^2+bx+c$, it means that $k=ax^2+bx+c$, or $ac=x^2+bx.$  The quadratic in terms of $x$ must have a leading coefficient zero, because the vertex of the parabola is the center of the parabola, and the difference between the coordinates of any pair of points on $y=k$ is always constant.  Therefore, we get $bx=-2ax$, which in turn means that $b=-2a$.\nSo the equation of the original parabola is $y=ax^2-2ax+c.$  We know that the vertex is $(h,k)$, so $c=k$, and $k=ax^2-2ax+k$.  This means $ax^2-2ax+0=x^2+bx$, which is equivalent to $ax^2-2ax+k=ax^2-2ax+x^2$, or $x^2=0$.  Therefore, $(h,k)$ is a vertex of the original parabola since the discriminant is zero.\nFrom this, we can deduce that the vertex of the reflected parabola is also $(h,k)$.  The equation of the reflected parabola is $y=k+dx^2+ex+f$, where $(h,k)$ is the vertex of the reflected parabola.  From here, we can substitute $x=0$ and $y=k$ into the equation of the parabola to get $k=k+d(0)^2+e(0)+f,$ which then means $f=k$, because $d(0)^2$ means $0$.",

As a result, the equation is $y = f$ and $a+b+c=0$ Therefore, $a+b+c+d+e+f=\\boxed{0}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 0. I hope it is correct. And, $k-c+al^",
        " First, recall the equation for a reflected parabola. That is, $y=(x-h)^2+k$.  Second, substitute the equation of y in the new equation that was given. That is, \\begin{align*}\ny &= dx^2+ex+f\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad(x-h)^2+k &= dx^2+ex+f\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad k &= dx^2+ex+f-x^2+2hx-h^2\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 0 &= (d-1)x^2+(2h-e)x+(h^2-f+k)\\\\\n\\end{align*}At this point, we notice that $d$ and $a$ will be the same because the equation for the reflected parabola is still in vertex form on the right-hand side of the equation. Therefore, $d=a$ and since $d=k$ (this is the easiest way to find the vertex), $a=k$. So far, this is our equation of the line; we will now find $b$ and $c$. So, $$d-1 = 0$$ $$2h-e = 0$$ $$h^2-f+k = 0$$ By solving these equations, we get that $b=2h$ and $c=h^2+k$. Lastly, since $f=k$, we finally get that $a+b+c+d+e+f = k + 2h + h^2+k + (k) = \\boxed{2h+h^2+2k}$.",

        " \nWe have that $y=ax^2+bx+c$ is a parabola with vertex $(h,k)$. This means that $k$ is the minimum or maximum of the function (depending on whether $a>0$ or $a<0$). As a result, $a\\cdot h^2+b\\cdot h+c=k$. Note that the parabola is reflected about the line $y=k$, so we can write down the reflected parabola as: \\[y=k-a(x-h)^2.\\]This equation simplifies to $y=k-dx^2+e$.

        " To reflect $(h,k)$ about the line $y=k$, we just keep $k$ constant and swap $x$'s in the equation, so we just find the equation $k=ax^2-bx+c+k$. This means the reflected parabola will have equation $y=ax^2-bx+c$. Therefore, $d=a$, $e=-b$, and $f=c+k$.",
        " \nGiven vertices $(h, k)$ and equation $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ are given.

        " \nThe vertex of a parabola of the form $y=ax^2+bx+c$ is given by $\\left(-\\frac{b}{2a}, c-\\frac{b^2}{4a}\\right)$. Therefore, when the parabola is reflected about the line $y=k$, its vertex is still $(h,k)$, and the equation of the reflected parabola is also of the form $y=ax^2+bx+c$, with $a$,$b$ and $c$ being different from the previous ones.\nThe equation of the original parabola is $y=ax^2+bx+c$, the equation of the reflected parabola is $y=d(x-h)^2+k$. When the vertex of the parabola is reflected about the line $y=k$, its y coordinate remains the same, so $k=k$. Therefore, $c=k$ and $f=k$.\nLet $y_1=ax^2+bx+c$ be the equation of the original parabola, and let $y_2=d(x-h)^2+k$ be the equation of the reflected parabola. The y coefficient of each parabola is $y_1=ax^2+bx+c$ and $y_2=d(x-h)^2+k$, which implies $a=d$.\nBy quadratic formula, if $y_1=0$, then $x=\\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$. Similarly, if $y_2=0$, then $x=\\frac{2dh\\pm\\sqrt{(2dh)^2-4dk}}{2d}=\\frac{h\\pm\\sqrt{h^2-1}}{1}$. As the equations are reflections of each other, $h$ must be the $x$ coordinate of the new vertex of the parabola $y_1$ when the parabola is translated $c$ units upwards, i.e., $a\\left(-\\frac{b}{2a}-h\\right)^2+b\\left(-\\frac{b}{2a}-h\\right)+c=k$. Expanding the left hand side and rearranging the equation, we obtain $h^2-bh$, which means that $h=\\frac{b}{2}$. Now we have $a=d$ and $h=\\frac{b}{2}$, so by substitution, $\\frac{b^",
        " We are asked about the value of ($a$ + $b$ + $c$ + $d$ + $e$ + $f$) in terms of $k$. So let\u2019s write down $a$ + $b$ + $c$ + $d$ + $e$ + $f$.\n### First: The vertex of the parabola $y$ = $a x^2$ + $b x$ + $c$ is $(h, k)$, then the equation of the parabola is $y$ - $k$ = $a(x - h)^2$. We have to write the equation in the form of $y$ = $a x^2$ + $b x$ + $c$. To do this, we need to get all $x^2$ terms on one side of the equal sign. We have $y$ - $k$ = $a(x - h)^2$. Multiplying the right side by $a$ and adding $k$ to both sides, we have $y$ = $a x^2$ + $2 a h x$ + $(\\left(\\right. a h^{2} \\left.\\right) + k \\left.\\right)$. Since $y$ = $a x^2$ + $b x$ + $c$, this implies $a h^{2}$ + $k$ = $c$ and $2 a h$ = $b$.\n### Now, before reflecting the parabola about the line $y$ = $k$, first make the parabola y = $a x^2$ + $b x$ + $c$ to the vertex form. Since we have to get the same term $x^2$ at the left side of the equation, we will expand $(x - h)^2$. We have $y$ = $a(x - h)^2$ = $a(x^2 - 2 h x + h^2)$ = $a x^2$ - $2 a h x$ + $a h^2$ = $a x^2$ + $b x$ + $c$. We can see that $b$ = $- 2 a h$ and $c$ = $a h^2 + k$. So $y$ = $a x^2$ - $2 a h x$ + $a h^2$ + $k$ = $a x",
        " I think $d=2a$, $e=-2b$, $f=2k$. This is true for a wide class of functions. If the parabola is shifted and then changed, then shifted again this should still be true. What is the general solution? Without solving the problem by hand, we can reproduce the shifted function, which will do the trick. Note that we can put the given information in the coordinate plane. The given vertex is at $(h,k)$. As $y = ax^2 + bx + c$, the vertex of the parabola is such that $ax^2 + bx + c = k$ must be true. Thus $ah^2 + bh + c = k$. To shift $y=ax^2+bx+c$ by $k$ units, we will use $y-k=ax^2+bx+c-k$ The reflection of a function about the line $y=k$ is the same as the negative of the function plus $2k$. So we have to shift both the function and the line by $k$ units, and then the negative of that equation is the reflection. Thus $y-k=k-ax^2-bx-c+k=2k-(ax^2+bx+c)=2k+y-k$ For completeness, the full function above is $y=(1-2a)x^2-(2b)x+(2k-c)$. And now let\u2019s consider the functions that don\u2019t have $c$. The reasons it might have $c$ are either the parabola goes through $(x_0,y_0)$ in $(x_0,k)$ is in that case. Otherwise there might be $c\\geq0$. Here the given vertex $(h,k)$ either might have a certain function $f(x)=k$ or the parabola goes through the vertex. The Remark shows that we should pick $(x_0,y_0)=(h,k)$ for both. So the parabola goes through the $x$-axis. Is it parabolic? Think of points $(1,2)$ and $(1,0)$, as they give the same reflection about the $x$-axis, so also reflections about $y=k$. Now we can factor\n$$ax^2+bx+k=0$$ We can also consider $y-k$ shifted $y-k/k=ax^2/bx+1$. And we know $f(x)=k$, and $(0,k)$. So we can",
        " Since $y=k$ is the line of reflection, the parabola with equation $y=ax^2+bx+c$ needs to \u201cvisit\u201d this line twice in order to get to $y=dx^2+ex+f$. The first time it visits this line, the y-coordinate is $k$. Thus, we have that $k=ax^2+bx+c$. Now, taking the second derivative, we have $y=k$. So, $y$ is now taking the second derivative, and $x$ needs to be replaced by $x\u2019$, resulting in $k\u2019=2ax\u2019+b$. The vertex must be the place where this new parabola crosses that line. Therefore, we must have $k\u2019=k$, so $2ax\u2019+b=k$. Since $x\u2019$ is known, the second equation is $ax\u2019=-\\frac{b}{2}$. Using the symmetry property of conic sections, the two vertices will be equidistant from the line of reflection, making $x\u2019=\\frac{h}{2}$. Thus, $-\\frac{b}{2}=\\frac{h}{2}(2a)=ah$. Simplifying $-\\frac{b}{2}=ah$, we get $b=-2ah$. To finish finding $d$, $e$, and $f$, a calculato want to solve for $c$ since it\u2019s the only one we don\u2019t know. Solving for $c$ from the equation $k=ax^2+bx+c$, we get $c=k-ax^2-bx$. Simplifying gives us $c=k-(a(x^2-2hx+\\frac{b^2}{4a})+\\frac{-2bh}{4a})$ $c=k-(a(x^2-2hx+\\frac{b^2}{4a})+\\frac{-2b(-2ah)}{4a})$ $c=k-(x^2-2hx+\\frac{b^2}{4a})+\\frac{h^2}{4}$ $c=k-x^2+2hx+\\frac{b^2}{4a}-\\frac{h^2}{4}=k$ $c=k$ Now that we have all equations and all values of $a$, $b$, and $c$, we can find $d$, which is going to be $a$ since the quadratic term hasn\u2019t changed (the parabola was flipped, but",
