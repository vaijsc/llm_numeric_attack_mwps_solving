        " Problem Solving - Analysis\nGiven that we have inequality of the form:\n$\\frac15|7+2a|<3$\nThe goal is to solve this inequality.",
        " \nTo solve the inequality, we first consider the following cases for the expression $7+2a$:\n1. $7+2a \\geq 0\\implies a\\geq \\frac{-7}{2}$.\n2. $7+2a <0\\implies a < \\frac{-7}{2}$.\\begin{align*}\nCase 1: \\frac15|7+2a|&<3 \\\\\n\\frac15(7+2a)&<3\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad 7+2a &< 15\\\\\na&<\\frac{8}{2}=4\n\\end{align*}\n\\begin{align*}\nCase 2: \\frac15|7+2a|&<3 \\\\\n\\frac15|-7-2a|&<3\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad -7-2a &< 15\\\\\na &> \\frac{-15-7}{2}=\\frac{-22}{2}=-11\n\\end{align*}\nIt is easy to note that $a>-11$ is needed. Combining both cases, we have that $-11<a<4$. Therefore, the solution set to this inequality is $\\boxed{(-11,4)}$\n### References:\n* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_notation\n* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_inequality\n* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)\n### Technology:\n* TI-83 or 84: fnI(-11 frontier(1)) to (-11),4 frontier(2)\n### Jounal:\n\\section{Notes}\nHere I have practiced solving linear inequalities.

        " We have $\\frac15|7+2a|<3.$ Because we are dealing with an absolute value function, this means that $-3<\\frac15(7+2a)<3$, or $\\frac{1}{5}\\cdot7-3<\\frac{2}{5}a<\\frac{1}{5}\\cdot7+3.$ That gives us $\\frac{2}{5}a>-6+7$ and $\\frac{2}{5}a<-4+7$.\nor $\\frac{1}{5}a>1$. The solution set for a will then be $$\\boxed{(5,+\\infty).}$$ In interval notation, we have $(5,+\\infty)$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is (5,+\\infty). I hope it is correct.### Expert Solution:\nLet\u2019s solve for$a$: $\\frac15|7+2a|<3.$ Because we are dealing with an absolute value function, this means that $-3<\\frac15(7+2a)<3$, or $\\frac{1}{5}\\cdot7-3<\\frac{2}{5}a<\\frac{1}{5}\\cdot7+3.$ That gives us $\\frac{2}{5}a>-6+7$ and $\\frac{2}{5}a<-4+7$.\nmultiplying both sides by\u00a0$\\frac{5}{2}$:\n$$a > 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad a < 11.$$\nSo the solution set, in interval notation, is $\\boxed{(1,11)}$.### Remark: This could be written more compactly in interval notation $\\boxed{(1,11)}$ eius/7s1592018-12-01 01:59:15\nFinal Answer: The final answer is (1,11). I hope it is correct.### Expert Solution:\nLet\u2019s think step by step.\n### ",
        " $\\boxed{(-\\frac{23}{5}, -\\frac{15}{5})}$",
        " a : [-5, 1]",
        " If the inequality inside the absolute value has the same sign as the one outside, the inequality is satisfied, whereas if the signs are different, the inequality is broken. Therefore, we split this problem into cases.\nCase 1: $7+2a>0\\Rightarrow a>\\frac72$ \u2013 This means $a$ is more than 7 divided by 2. Hence the left side\u2019s value would change by 5/5.\n### "
