Solving for $d$, we find $d=\\boxed{27}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 27. I hope it is correct.  ### Explanation: #### The Problem Here, it says that c and d are inversely proportional which means that c*d=k, for some constant k. So, we can rewrite our equation as c/d=k. It means that as one of the variables increases, the other decreases. In our problem, when c=12 and d=9, we can substitute these values into our equation and we get 12/9=k, which becomes k=4. So, our equation becomes c/d=4. Because we know that c=12 when d=9, we can test our equation with these values. We get 12/9=4, which is true. So, our equation is correct. Now, we want to find d when c=4. We can substitute c=4 into our equation and we get 4/d=4, or d=1. But, c must be greater than or equal to 0, because it's a positive number. So, we cannot have c=0. We can substitute c=4 and d=1 into our equation to check if it's true or not. We get 4/1=4, which is true. So, our equation is still correct. So, our answer is d=1. But, since c and d are inversely proportional and c becomes smaller by a factor of 3, d will become larger by a factor of 3. So, d must become 3 times bigger than it was when c was 12. And d was 9, so we need to multiple d by 3 to get 27. #### The Solution This problem is quite simple if you know how to solve inverse proportion problems. We are told that c and d are inversely proportional and that c=12 when d",
