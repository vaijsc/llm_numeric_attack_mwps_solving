        " \nLet\u2019s start. Since $2ab=52$, we can divide by 2 and also simplify $2ab$: $$ab = 26$$ Now we have our goal. We know we need to evaluate $8a^2b^2$. Before we proceed, recall how to double any value: \\begin{align*}\n2a &= a+a \\\\\n2a^2 &= 2(a^2) \\\\\na^2 + a^2 &= 2a^2\n\\end{align*}Applying this back to our goal, we want to write $8a^2b^2$ as a combination of like terms. $$8a^2b^2 = (a^2 + a^2 + a^2 + a^2)b^2$$ Next, we realize that the term inside the brackets is 4 $a^2$\u2019s. We can now construct the expression by replacing $a^2$ with the actual value: $$8a^2b^2 = (4a^2)b^2=4(a^2b^2)$$ Since we know $ab=26$, we can multiply 24 by itself: $$4(a^2b^2) = 4(a^2 \\cdot (ab)) = 4(a^2 \\cdot 26) = 4(a^2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 13)$$ This portion of the equation shows that $(a^2 \\cdot 2) = 2a^2$. We can now add this to the rest of the equation. $$4(a^2 \\cdot 13) = 4(2a^2 \\cdot 13) = 8a^2 \\cdot 13$$ Since we want to evaluate the entire equation, we can finally multiply the two terms: $$8a^2 \\cdot 13 = 104a^2$$ This is our final answer\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 104a^2. I hope it is correct.\\\n### Explanation\nSolving the equation $2ab = 52$ for $ab$, we obtain $ab = 26$, so we can evaluate $8a^2b^2$ by writing $$8a^2b^2 = (4a^2)b^2 = 4(a^2b^2) = 4(a^2 \\cdot (ab)) = 4(a^2 \\cdot 26) =",
        " \nSolution: Since $2ab=52$, we have $ab = 26$. Square both sides to get $$a^2b^2 = a^2b^2 = (ab)^2 = 676.$$Multiply both sides by 8 to find $$8a^2b^2 = \\boxed{5384}.$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 5384. I hope it is correct.

        " First, we know that $2ab = 52$. We should solve for $b$ first. To do this, we divide both sides by 2 and then divide both sides by $a$. $b = \\frac{52}{2a} = 26/a$\n### ",
