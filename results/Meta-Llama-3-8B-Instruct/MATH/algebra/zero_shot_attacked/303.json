I hope it is correct. ### plugging in x=0: Since $(x\\sqrt{x^3})^4 = (x)(x^3)^{2} = x(x^6),$ we must have $$x(x^6) = 0$$if $x\\ne 0.$ However, if $x=0$ we also have $$(0\\sqrt{(0)^3})^4 = (0)(0^3)^{2} = 0.$$ So it seems like treating $\\sqrt{(0)^3}$ the same way we treated $(\\sqrt{x^3})^2$ , i.e., evaluating it as 0, leads to the correct result. I am not sure if this is the recommended method to handle this type of problem. We would not usually deal with a cube root of 0 in the context of this problem. We might instead consider a problem like $\\sqrt{(x-4)^3}$ and then simplify the expression using $$(x-4)^3 = {(x^3-12x^2+8x-64)}$$From here on we could proceed with the square root. Still, this problem serves as an opportunity to practice working with 0 as the argument of a function that we are supposed to simplify. Any suggestions? Final Answer: The final answer is x^4.

Let\u2019s start by simplifying the square root part. Recall that $\\sqrt{a^b}=a^{b/2}$. Here, $a=x^3$ and $b=1$, so the $\\sqrt{x^3}$ becomes $x^{3/2}$.\nSo, we have: $(x\\cdot x^{3/2})^4$. Let\u2019s try to simplify this. $(x\\cdot x^{3/2})^4=(x^{1+3/2})^4$ using the power-of-a-power rule.\nSimplifying, we get: $x^{(1+3/2)\\cdot4}$ by multiplying the exponents.\nSimplifying further, we get: $x^{7}$, which is our final answer.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 7. I hope it is correct.",
