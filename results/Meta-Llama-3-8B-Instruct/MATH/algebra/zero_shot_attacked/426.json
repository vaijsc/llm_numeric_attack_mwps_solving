        " We have two factors of $x$ in the expression: $(28-16)(28+16)$. To solve the question, we first subtract $16$ from $28$ to get $12$; then we add $16$ and $28$ together to get $44$. The expression becomes $12\\cdot44$, which we know as the product of the two numbers, or $(12)(44)$. The front number in the product is $12$, so $12\\cdot44=528$ is the final answer.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 528.
