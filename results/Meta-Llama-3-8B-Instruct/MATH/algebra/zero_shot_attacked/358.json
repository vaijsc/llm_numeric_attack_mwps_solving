        " \nThe equation to solve is $\\frac{9-4x}{x+6}=8$.\nLet\u2019s think step by step.\nFirst, multiply both sides of the equation by $x+6$ to get rid of the fraction:\n$\\frac{9-4x}{x+6}(x+6)=8(x+6)$.\nThe left side of the equation is equal to $9-4x$ and the right side is equal to $8x+48$. Thus, we are left with the equation $9-4x=8x+48$.\nNow, reproduce the equation:\n$9-4x=8x+48$.\nNext, subtract $8x$ from both sides of the equation to get:\n$-4x-8x=48-9$.\nNext, carry out the addition and subtraction:\n$-12x=39$.\nAt this point, we can see that $x$ is negative, so we can divide both sides of the equation by $-12$:\n$\\frac{-12x}{-12}=\\frac{39}{-12}$.\nWe can simplify the left side of the equation to get:\n$x=-\\frac{39}{12}=-\\frac{13}{4}$.\nSo, we have found that $x=-\\frac{13}{4}$.\n### Answer\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -\\frac{13}{4}.

When multiplying the denominator $x+6$ by the reciprocal $\\frac{1}{x+6}$, we can cancel terms to simplify it.\n$9-4x$ must be multiplied by the reciprocal $\\frac{1}{x+6}$ to obtain a common denominator. Well, $\\frac{1}{x+6}\\cdot 9-4x= \\frac{9}{x+6}-\\frac{4x}{x+6}=\\frac{8x+48}{x+6}$.\nTherefore, we have $\\boxed{\\frac{9-4x}{x+6}= \\frac{8x+48}{x+6}}$ and $9-4x=8x+48$.\n $9-4x=8x+48.$\nNotice that a linear combination of $x$ and a constant is given. Equating the coefficients of $x$, we get $-4=8$.\n Equating the constant terms, we obtain $9=48$. $9$ and $48$ are not equal, so the equation for $x$ is clearly obtained. By eliminating variables $x$, we obtain $9=48+8x$. Therefore, $52x=9$, which gives us $x =\\boxed{-\\frac{1}{13}}$.\nUltimately, the final answer is $\\boxed{ -\\frac{1}{13}}$.

        " \nThe instruction is to solve the quadratic equation $\\frac{9-4x}{x+6} = 8$. We can rearrange the equation to become $9-4x = 8x + 48$. By distributing the 4 and 8 to $x$, we have $9 = 12x + 48$. We must subtract $48$ from both sides of the equation. $9 - 48$ will be equal to $-39$. $12x$ will then be $-39$ and we can then solve for $x$ by dividing both sides of the equation by $12$. $12x = -39$. By dividing both sides of the equation by $12$, we have $\\frac{12x}{12} = \\frac{-39}{12}$. This will be equal to $x = \\frac{-39}{12}$. $x = \\frac{-39}{12}$ simplifies to $x = \\frac{-13}{4}$. The solution will be $x = \\boxed{\\frac{-13}{4}}$. ",
