Let\u2019s calculate it: ?((1 - (-5))\u00b2 + (13 - 1)\u00b2) = \u221a((6)\u00b2 + (12)\u00b2) = \u221a(36 + 144) = \u221a180 = \u221a(2 \u00d7 90) = 2\u221a90.

That is we can write, $|x_2 - x_1| = |1 - (-5)| = |6| = 6$. Step 3: If we repeat the same process for $y$ coordinates, we get $|y_2 - y_1| = |13 - 1| = |12| = 12$. So now the distance between two points. Please see the image containg two points and calculator to find three parts of distance. |Xc | = Distance AB So, Unit length is given by $\\sqrt{(6)^2 + (12)^2} = \\sqrt{36+144} = \\sqrt{180} = \\boxed{\\sqrt{180}}$.\n### Final Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{\\sqrt{180}}$. I hope it is correct. <!>\n#### Tags\n#### Related Lessons\n    - ##### Brief Introduction: This chapter is dedicated to measuring and calculating various geometrical facts such as perimeter, area, and volume, etc. These facts are crucially important in various fields like architecture, engineering, carpentry, etc. So, it is very important to grasp these concepts correctly. In this problem, we are required to find the length of a segment whose endpoints are given.\n    - Distance/Displacement/Interval problem.",
        " \nThe x-coordinates of the endpoints are -5 and 1. The difference between these values is\n$$1-(-5)=1+5=6.$$\n### Solution: The y-coordinates are 1 and 13. The difference between these values is\n$$13-1=12.$$\nSo, the distance between line segments is: $\\sqrt{6^{2}+12^{2}}=\\sqrt{36+144}=\\sqrt{180}=6\\sqrt{5}$. The unit length is: $6\\sqrt{5}$ units. ",
        " 14\nExplanation:  In order to find the length of the segment, we will use the distance formula. Let\u2019s use it!\nFirst, we denote the coordinates of the endpoints (we already know them):\n-5,1 and 1,13\nThen, we use the formula:\n\u221a[(x_2 \u2013 x_1)^2 + (y_2 \u2013 y_1)^2]\nNow, substitute the values of x1, y1, x2, y2:\n\u221a[(1-(-5))^2 + (13-1)^2]\nCalculate the values:\n\u221a[6^2 + 12^2]\n\u221a[36 + 144]\n\u221a[180]\nSo, the distance between the points (-5,1) and (1,13) is 14 units long. That\u2019s it! The answer is 14.\n### Tips:\n- Remember the distance formula: \u221a[(x_2 \u2013 x_1)^2 + (y_2 \u2013 y_1)^2]. It will come in handy many times!\n- Always label the coordinates in the correct order (x1, y1, x2, y2). It saves time and reduces errors!\n- Check your calculations carefully. One small mistake can lead to a big difference in the answer! \ud83e\udd2f",
        " \nWe will calculate the length of the segment using the distance formula:\nD = sqrt ((x1-x2)^2 + (y1-y2)^2)\nIn our case:\nx1 = -5\ny1 = 1\nx2 = 1\ny2 = 13",
        " We already know the two points (-5,1) and (1,13) are our endpoints.\n### Step 1: To find the horizontal distance or length, we calculate the difference between the x-coordinates. \nIn our case, 1 - (-5) = 6.\n### Step 2: To find the vertical distance or length, we calculate the difference between the y-coordinates.\nIn our case, 13 - 1 = 12.\n### Step 3: The total length of the line segment can be calculated with Pythagorean theorem. \nIn our case, \u221a(6\u00b2+12\u00b2) = \u221a(36+144) = \u221a180. \n### Result: The total length of the line segment is approximately 12.96 units.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \u2248 12.96. I hope it is correct.  Please let me know if you need further clarification.  \n```python\nimport math\ndef distance(p1, p2):\n    x1, y1 = p1\n    x2, y2 = p2\n    return math.sqrt((x2-x1)**2 + (y2-y1)**2)\np1 = (-5,1)\np2 = (1,13)\nprint(distance(p1, p2))\n```\nPlease run the Python code above.\n",
        " Let's break this problem down!\nA segment is the line that connects two points, so we want to find the distance between the points (-5,1) and (1,13).\nWe know the formula for distance between two points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) is:\ndistance = sqrt[(x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2]`\nSo, for the points (-5,1) and (1,13):\n```\ndistance = sqrt[ (1 - (-5))^2 + (13-1)^2]\n= sqrt[(6)^2 + (12)^2]\n= sqrt(36+144)\n= sqrt180\n= 6sqrt5\n```\nSo, a segment whose endpoints are (-5,1) and (1,13) is 6\u221a5 units long. \ud83c\udf89\n### Comment\nGreat job breaking it down step by step! The formula for the distance between two points is really helpful in solving this problem. \ud83d\udca1\n### ",
