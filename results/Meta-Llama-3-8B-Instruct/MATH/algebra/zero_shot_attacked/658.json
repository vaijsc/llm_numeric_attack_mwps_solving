        " Let $a , b$, and $c$ be nonnegative real numbers, and let $$A = a + b + c, \\qquad \\qquad B = ab + bc + ca, \\qquad \\qquad C = a^2 + b^2 + c^2.$$Then the fact that $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 13$ means that $C = 13$ and the fact that $ab + bc + ca = 4$ means that $B = 4$. We are asked to find $A = a + b + c$.\nWe have two equations, $C = 13$ and $B = 4$, and we would like to find $A = a + b + c$. But, if we take the traces of both sides of the equation $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 13$, we get $(a + b + c)^2 = 9$, which is different from $A$.\nWe know that in a square of $(a,b)$, two lines go through it at right angles, so $(a,b)$ are rational.

        " \nWe are given that $a^2+b^2+c^2=13$ and $ab+bc+ca=4$. Squaring the second equation and simplifying, we have \\begin{align*}\n(ab+bc+ca)^2&=(a+b+c)^2-2(ab+bc+ca)(ab+bc-ca)\\\\\n&=13-2(4)(ab-4)\\\\\n&=13-8a,\n\\end{align*}and rearranging gives $8a-13=a^2+b^2+c^2$. Squaring both sides, we find that\n$$\\boxed{64a^2-104a+169=a^4+2a^2(b^2+c^2)+(b^2+c^2)^2}.$$This might look messy, but it is good that we are given a nice equation to work with. In any case, since $a,b,c\\geq0$, we have that $b^2+c^2\\geq0$ and so $64a^2\\leq169$. However, $64a^2\\geq0$. Squaring the second equation gives\n$$a^4+2a^2(b^2+c^2)+(b^2+c^2)^2=(a^2+b^2+c^2)^2=169,$$forcing $64a^2=130$. Hence, $a=5/4$, $b$, and $c$. This implies that $a+b+c=\\boxed{5/2}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 5/2.

        " \n1.  First, we split the sum into the following parts:\n$$\\sum_{cyc}(a^2 + bc) = \\sum_{cyc}(a^2) + \\sum_{cyc}bc$$\nNow, we know that $\\sum_{cyc}(a^2) = 13$, and $ab + bc + ca = 4$.\n2.  Now, let\u2019s try to set up an expression by adding and subtracting the sum:\n$$\\left(\\sum_{cyc}(a^2) + 2(ab + bc + ca) \\right) - (ab + bc + ca) = 13 - 4$$\nNow, we simplify and rearrange:\n$$\\left(\\sum_{cyc}(a^2) + 2(ab + bc + ca) \\right) - (ab + bc + ca) = 9$$\n$$\\sum_{cyc}a^2 = 9$$\n3.  So, $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 9$. Now, we can continue. Now, it is given that $ab + bc + ca = 4$. Notice that $(a + b + c)^2 - \\sum_{cyc}(a^2) = \\left(a + b + c\\right)^2 - 9$.\n4.  We expand $(a + b + c)^2$:\n$$(a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2ab + 2bc + 2ca$$\nNotice the following two things:\n1.  $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 9$, so we can replace that part with $9$. The rest is as follows:\n$$\\left(a + b + c\\right)^2 = 9 + 2ab + 2bc + 2ca$$\n2.  $2ab + 2bc + 2ca = 8$, because $2(ab + bc + ca) = 8$.\nSo, $(a + b + c)^2 - 9 = 8$, which means $(a + b + c)^2 = 17$.\n5.  Since $(a + b + c)^2 = 17$, the sum of the values of $a, b,$ and $c$ is $\\boxed{3\\sqrt{17} }$.\n",

Hence, we have\n$$(a+b+c)^2=a^2+b^2+c^2+2ab+2ac+2bc=13+2\\cdot 4=21.$$Therefore, the sum of $a,b,$ and $c$ is\n$$\\sqrt{21},$$and the problem again asks us to add $\\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2}$ to $\\sqrt{(a+b+c)^2}$, but $a^2+b^2+c^2=13$ is already given!\nTherefore, the sum of $a,b,$ and $",

However, I will give another way of solving this problem.\n### Alternative Solution:We have that $$(a+b+c)^2=a^2+b^2+c^2+2ab+2bc+2ca=13.$$The first four terms equal $$(a+b+c)^2=(a+b+c)^2=(a+b+c)^2.$$As a result, this can be rewritten as$$a^2+b^2+c^2+2ab+2bc+2ca=(a+b+c)^2=13.$$Since $ab+bc+ca=4,$ we have that $$a^2+b^2+c^2+2ab+2bc+2ca=(a+b+c)^2=13.$$ Now, subtracting $4$ from both sides, we have $$a^2+b^2+c^2=9.$$Dividing both sides by $9,$ we have $$\\frac{a^2+b^2+c^2}{9}=1.$$We can quickly see that $a^2$ and $b^2$ cannot be $0$ because if at least one of the three numbers is $0,$ then the sum is $13.$Furthermore, if the sum of the squares of two numbers is equal to $1,$ then the two numbers must be $+1,$ and $-1.$ Hence, we can write $a^2=1,b^2=1,c^2=1.$ Since we have this information, we can substitute these values into the equation, which is equal to$$(a+b+c)^2=13.$$As a result, this has simplifications that yield a relatively easy equation to solve for:",
        " \nFirstly, notice that $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 13$.\nNow note that $a^2 + b^2 + 2ab + c^2 = (a+b+c)^2$.\nSubtracting the equation $ab+bc+ca = 4$ yields\n$(a+b+c)^2 - 4 = 13$.\nExpanding gives $a^2 + b^2 + 2ab + c^2 + 2ab + 2bc + 2ca - 4 = 13$. Which becomes\n$(a+b+c)^2 = 17$.\nSo now we know that $(a+b+c)^2 = 17$. To get rid of the square on the far left, we can take a square root, but we have to heed the restriction that $a + b + c > 0$. Now we get $a + b + c = \\boxed{\\pm \\sqrt{17}}$.",
