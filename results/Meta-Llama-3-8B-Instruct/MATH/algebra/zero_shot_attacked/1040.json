        " Solving the given equation\nWe have $x(3x-7)=5$, or equivalently $3x^2-7x-5=0$.  We can solve it by moving all terms to the left side: $x(3x-7)=5$ becomes $3x^2-7x-5=0$.  Distributing and rearranging terms yields\n$3x^2-7x-5=0$, which factorizes as $(3x+1)(x-5)=0$.\n### Relevant Results:\nFrom here we have two solutions: $x=-\\frac{1}{3}$ and $x=5$.  We can apply the solution to the original question: $x(3x-7)=5$.  Replacing $x$ with either solutions, we get $-\\frac{1}{3}\\left(-\\frac{7}{3}+7\\right)=5$ and $5(15-7)=5$.  These are consistent with our solution.\nTherefore, $m$ can be $-\\frac{1}{3}$ and $5$, $n=49$ and $-0$, respectively, and $p=3$.  The sum is $-\\frac{1}{3}+49+3+5=48+3=\\boxed{51}$.",
