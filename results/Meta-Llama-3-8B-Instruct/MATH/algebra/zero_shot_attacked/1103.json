        " This is a problem given in solution scope.\nHere, we are asked to find the length of the segment of the number line consisting of the points that satisfy (x-4)^2 <= 9.\nWe know that the square of the distance between x and 4 is less than or equal to 9, which means 4 - 3 <= x <= 4 + 3, i.e., x is in between 1 and 7.\nTherefore, the length of the segment is 7 - 1 = 6.\n### 6 points math Hint: square root, then 2(2.25) = 4.5\n### 1 answer: A solution involves simplifying (x-4)^2 <= 9 and solving for x.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 6. I hope it is correct..\nHere is the CBSE Class 10 Maths Chapter 6 exercise question solution:\nQ.6 The length of the segment of the number line consisting of the points that satisfy (x-4)^2 <= 9 is:\n(a) 2 units\n(b) 4 units\n(c) 6 units\n(d) 8 units\nSolution: Simplifying the given inequality, we get:\n(x \u2013 4)^2 \u2264 9\nx^2 \u2013 8x + 16 \u2264 9\nx^2 \u2013 8x + 7 \u2264 0\n(x \u2013 1)(x \u2013 7) \u2264 0\n1 \u2264 x \u2264 7\nSo, the length of the segment is (7 \u2013 1) = 6 units.\nTherefore, the correct answer is (c) 6 units.",
        " \nBy squaring both sides, the given inequality can be rewritten as |x-4| <= 3. This indicates that x-4 is within 3 units from 0. The points satisfying this inequality constitute a segment on the number line.\nThe minimum value of x-4 is -3 (corresponding to x = 1), and the maximum value is 1 (corresponding to x = 5). The length of this segment is thus equal to the difference between its maximum and minimum values, which is 1 - (-3) = 4. Therefore, the length of the segment is 4 units.\nAlternatively, we can use the definition of absolute value to simplify the expression and obtain:\n-3 <= x - 4 <= 3\n3 <= x <= 7\nThis shows that x is within 3 units from 4. With x being 1 unit to the left of 4 and x being 3 units to the right of 4, we get the same answer that the length of the segment is 4 units. ",
        " The length can be calculated by finding the points that satisfy the given inequality. We know that for any real number a, a^2 <= b^2 if and only if a <= |b|.\n### So to solve this inequality, we have to figure out what the value of |x-4| could be.\n### Clearly, |x-4| <= 3 as this will imply (x-4)^2 <= 9 as given. And since we know the absolute value function is surjective, we know |x-4| >= -3 and so |x-4| <= 3.\n### So solving for x, we get -3 <= x-4 <= 3.\n### Therefore, -3 + 4 <= x <= 3 + 4.\n### And the length of the segment of the number line satisfying the inequality is therefore |7-4| = 3.\n### So the answer is 3.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 3.

This inequality will be satisfied by all the x values which give (x-4) <= 3 or (x-4) >= -3.\nThe first option gives x <= 7 and the second option gives x >= 1.  Collecting results, we see that the inequality will be satisfied by all the x values from 1 to 7. \n### Solution: 7 - 1 + 1 = 7\nSo we see that all of these x values will give a distance from 4 in a segment that is 7 long. \nFinal Answer: The final answer is 7.
