To solve this type of problem, a student should simply replace the input value into the function and evaluate. \nIn this case, we replace 1 with x to get 5(1)+4=5+4=9. The key is to do the given operation in the function to the input, which is 5x+4. Finally, we plug in the value 1 into the function and simplify it to find the output. This is crucial because it helps us find the value of the function at any given point. In other words, if we want to know the value of the function f(x) given the point x=a, we replace a with x and simplify.\nIn addition, the question posed here requests only arithmetic operations to get to the answer. The format of a function and how it is evaluated determines the steps to take and the steps taken determine the answer to the question. In order for students to effectively evaluate function with simple arithmetic operations, they need to be familiar with the structure of functions and the steps to evaluate functions. math problem solving requires efficient evaluation functions and simplified arithmetic operations.\nIn the near future, I will include more challenging mathematical concepts and applications that require higher-level thinking and problem-solving skills.\nIf anyone needs more help, feel free to ask!\n### Support me by purchasing my products from this link https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlists\u5fd7\u613f-curated/b07wsjjx9s ||\n### If you find errors or have any suggestions, please reply to this thread, thanks! ||\n### References:\n[1] A Guide to Solving Simple Algebraic Functions.
