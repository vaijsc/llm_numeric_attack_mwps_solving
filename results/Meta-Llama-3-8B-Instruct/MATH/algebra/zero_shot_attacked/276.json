The vector from $O$ to $A$ is also (9,6).  \nLet us denote the point you land upon $P$, which is on $\\overline{OA}$ at a distance $\\frac{1}{3}$ from $O$.  It is a little harder to find the coordinates of $P$ by simple pencil-and-paper methods, so we will solve a few cases at this point.\nIf you add (9,6) to (0,1), the distance from $O$ is now 1.  A little reflexive thinking won't get you anywhere, so let us just do a little generalization first:  take $k$ times (9,6) and you get $\\frac{k}{1}$ along $\\overline{OA}$.\nNow, we will take $k = 2$ just to simplify things.  $O$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ of $(9,6)$ is the point we would like to find.  Adding $(9,6)$ to $(1,2)$ you now see that we are just 1 unit away from the end of the segment.  By taking $k = \\frac{1}{3}$, the point $(1,2)$ needs to have $\\frac{2}{3}$ of $(9,6)$ attached to it to express the point that we are at.  If we add the two vectors, we see that $\\boxed{(a,b)}$ has both coordinates given the values $\\boxed{3}$.  \nFinal Answer: The final answer is 3.

        " First, we should know the equation of the line segment that we are moving along. Since this line segment runs between $(0, 0)$ and $(9, 6),$ we can write its equation as $$y = \\frac{6}{9}x.$$Now, set $x$ equal to $9$ to see that the point $(9, 6)$ is indeed on this line. This equation really gets close to looking like the Slope-Intercept Form of a line, but $y$ should be isolated on the left side, and $x$ should be on the right side. This is because the line segment should look like this:\nall the way down or over.\n### ",
        " Let's start by creating a line segment with two points, (0,0) and (9,6). The distance from (0,0) to (9,6) is $\\sqrt{9^2 + 6^2} = 3\\sqrt{13}$. \nThe distance we're moving is $\\frac{1}{3}$ of that, so $\\frac{3\\sqrt{13}}{3} = \\sqrt{13}$. \nIn the x direction, $\\sqrt{13}$ is left of the midpoint of (0,0) and (9,6), which is (4.5,3). \nIn the y direction, we're 2 units from (4.5,3), as 2 is $\\frac{6}{3}$. \nThe point we end up at is (4.5,5.5).

        " The line segment possesses endpoints (0,0) and (9,6), both located in the $xy$-plane of Cartesian coordinates. Start at point (0,3) far away from the line connecting these two points. Specifically, we at (0,3). Then you move $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the way down the line. Since this line segment is also a chord, we now look at the portion of a chord that you have to conquer. Simply, the equation of it is $$y=\\frac{6}{9}(x-0)+0= \\frac{2}{3}x$$ in interval $(0,9)$. Thus $$y(0,3) = \\frac{2}{3}\\cdot0+3=3.$$Now, the straight line in the form of $$y=\\frac{2}{3}x$$ will pass our chosen route $(0,0)$ to $(0,3)$ also. The total length is proportional to $\\frac{3}{2}$, roughly 1.5 units. This gives $$\\frac{2}{3}(x-0)=\\frac{3}{2}, \\implies x =3$$ for (0,3), plotted in line. Lastly, $$y=\\frac{2}{3}(3)=2$$ and we are at (3,2). The aim of the target, the final result, lies in calculating the sum of all these numbers. The numbers are 3, 2 so, in any case, we go $3+2 = 5$; in the answer of 5, the coordinate from the$xy$-plane. For a final product called an EXIT.  Final result: Final  Answer: The answer is 5.
