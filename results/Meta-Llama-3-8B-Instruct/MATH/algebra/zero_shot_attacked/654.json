I hope it is correct.  If you need help, please ask someone. This is written for math in python. \nLet me take you through this code. Use python to create a function that applies the original steps. And we will walk through how we write it.\nIn python we would do something like this:\n```python\ndef f(x):\n    return 2*x + 1\ndef g(x):\n    return f(2*x) - 3\nprint(g(g(4)))\n```\nthis way we start from 4 and put it into the function g. The function g will then apply the steps (in this case, map the input to the output of function f evaluated at twice the input) to 4. It will do this and return 15. Then the function will then take that 15 and do it again. The output will be 59. So the final output of g(g(4)) would be 59.\nI think you would like this example unless you have any further questions.  This is a very simple way to do this. We don't need to use much of advance python language to achieve this. The steps that are given are the steps that the function g will follow. So if we don't have different text for the book but each time we would have the same steps as our function. So we created a function in python which can do this. \nWe can also calculate g(4) directly if the range if our fore is bigger. I showed you how you can directly find the value of g(4). It was 15. we can also keep doing what we are doing and keep going. We are going to find g(15) (4 times 15 and subtract 1) and we are going to get 59. But I think it is better to make a function.

        " \nWe have that $g(x) = f(2x) - 3 = 2(2x) + 1 - 3 = 4x - 1$.

I hope it is correct.  ### Additional Notes:\nWe really just computed $g(4)$ and then computed $g(g(4))$. This tells us that if we write \\[f(x)=2x+1\\] then $g(x)$ is the same as rewriting $f$ with $x$ replaced by $2x$ and subtracting 3. So we can think of $g(x)$ as 'shifting and compressing' the function $f(x)$ a bit. It is exercises like this that remind us that when dealing with functions, we need to stay careful about our notation and to write down our calculations carefully.\nIn general, when we write \\[g(x)=f(2x)-3\\] or, equivalently, $g(x)=2(x)+1-3$, it is not a bad idea to consider the calculation in two steps: calculate $f(2x)$, and then subtract 3. This helps us avoid mistakes, which can be hard to detect if we try to reduce our work down to one step. (An example of such an error would be if we incorrectly wrote $g(x)$ as \\[g(x)=2(2x)-3,\\] which is not correct.I hope this helps. Let me know if you have any questions.",

Then, draw a parallelogram on the graph where $x=2$, which is a line segment with slope $2$. This makes another graph of $g(x) = f(2x) - 3$. Draw a line vertical to the $y$-axis and it will give you the points of the graph of $g(x)$. You can see the point at where $x=4$ gives $g(4)$. Move your finger along the line to the right and you will be able to get to the point where $g(g(4))$. ### Answer: 54 Final Answer: The final answer is 54. I hope it is correct.

Finally, i encourage students to describe what happened to the points on the graph when we move a point on the graph to make it a graph of f(2x), since they asked \"So how does this make another graph of f(2x) - 3?\" You could have taken the asker a little further by explaining.

I hope it is correct.  I hope it may help! Let me know if you have any further questions. If it is correct, then how do we conclude that the function is increasing/decreasing? To be honest, this question did not mention much about the function f(x), but from its form, f(x) = 2x+1, we know that the function f(x) is increasing/decreasing. In this problem, g(4) > g(2) and g(14) > g(2), and so on. This tells us that the function is either increasing or non-decreasing. Because it cannot decrease forever, then it must be an increasing function. But, this is just my personal conclusion, and I am not sure if this part is correct or not. I would be happy if you could tell me more about it. Do you know how to determine the increasing/decreasing of the function? Do you have any examples? Do you have any advice about WolframAlpha? Finally, do you have any encouraging words for me? I am really sorry if there are any mistakes in the answer. Can you check if they are correct?"
