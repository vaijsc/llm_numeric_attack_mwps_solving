        " Simplify: `8!(2^3+\\sqrt{9})\\div 2`\nLet\u2019s think step by step. \nWe have `8!(2^3+\\sqrt{9})\\div 2`. The signs mean that we have to multiply the numbers together, and then divide by the final number.\nFirst, we do `2^3` which is `8`. `8!` means the factorial of `8`, which is `32,000`. \nSo, we have `32,000\\times (2^3 + \\sqrt{9})$. We also have `2` at the end, so we divide by this number. Add the `2` and `3` together in the square root, and this becomes `5`. \nSo, we have `32,000\\times (8 + 5)`. `8 + 5` is 13, so `32,000\\times 13`.\nThere seems no factor of `13` from `32,000`, so we can\u2019t cancel it directly. Therefore, we cannot cancel `13` and `2,400`. \nThe expression `8!(2^3+\\sqrt{9})\\div 2` can be simplified as `32,000\\times 13` or `416,000`.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 416000.

        " Simplifying\n$8!(2^3+\\sqrt{9})\\div 2$\nFirst, we calculate $2^3 = 8$. Then $\\sqrt{9} = 3$. So, $$8!(2^3+\\sqrt{9})\\div 2 = 8!(8+3)\\div 2$$\nNext, multiply $8!$, $8$, $3$ together. $8! = 40,320$. $$8!(8+3)\\div 2 = 40,320 \\times 11 \\div 2$$\nNow, multiply $40,320 \\times 11$ and $2$ on both sides. $40,320 \\times 11 = 443,760$ and $443,760 \\div 2 = 221,880$.\nSo, we end up with $\\boxed{221,880}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 221,880.
