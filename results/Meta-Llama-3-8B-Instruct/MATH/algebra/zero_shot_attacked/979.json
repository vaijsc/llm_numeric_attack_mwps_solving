If the unit is worth$\\$ w$ at the beginning of the year, its worth at the end of the year is$w-\\$ W,$ i.e., it depreciates at a rate of $\\$ W w$annually. Express this rate of depreciation in$\\%$by simplifying the fraction$\\frac{W}{w}\\cdot 100\\%.$ We know that this rate of depreciation is always between$0\\%$and$100\\%$.

        " Larry has 45 - Lenny's amount.\nLarry has 3/4 of Lenny's amount, so if Lenny's amount is x, Larry's amount is x * 3/4.\nThen, x * 3/4 = 45 - x.\nMultiply both sides by 4 to get 3x = 180 - 4x.\nAdd 4x to both sides to get 7x = 180.\nDivide both sides by 7 to get x = 25.80.\nThus, Lenny's amount is x = 25.80.

Lenny and Larry have 45 dollars in total:\nx + \\frac{3}{4}x = 45\n\\frac{7}{4}x = 45\nx = \\frac{45}{\\frac{7}{4}} = \\frac{4}{7} \\cdot 45 = \\frac{36}{3} = 12\nSo Lenny has 12 dollars. Since Larry has 3 quarters of Lenny\u2019s amount, Larry has 3/4 * 12 = 9 dollars. To find the difference between the amount that Lenny has and the amount that Larry has, we subtract:\n12 - 9 = 3\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 3. I hope it is correct. Read this problem carefully. It is saying that Larry has 3 _quarters_ of Lenny's amount. Each quarter of $\\$$12 is 12/4 = 3. So, Larry has 3 * 3 = 9 dollars. Since Lenny has$\\$$12, you can see that he has $\\$$3 more than Larry. Final Answer: The final answer is 3. I hope it is correct.  If you are still having trouble, then it makes sense. It said that Larry has$\\$$45 \\cdot  \\frac{3}{4}$and Lenny has$\\$$45 - $\\$$45 \\cdot \\frac{3}{4}$= $\\$$45 \\cdot \\frac{1}{4}$= $\\$$11$.25. Final Answer: The final answer is 11.25. I hope it is correct.  # Read This Problem Carefully. It States Larry Has \"Three-Quarters\" Of Lenny's Amount. Larry Has 3/4 Of Lenny's Amount. Let's Write An Equation: L = Amount Of Money That Larry Has L = 3/4 * Amount Of Money That Lenny Has L = 3/4 * Lenny The Equation Combines The Two Values. There are 45 Dollars In Total. The Equation Becomes: L = 3/4 * L 45 = L + L 45 = L * (5/4) L = 45 * 4/5 L = 36 So Lenny Has$\\$$36. Larry Has $\\$$36 * 3/4 = $\\$$27. So, Lenny",
        " Let\u2019s say Lenny has L dollars and Larry has L/4 dollars. Thus, we can write an equation:\nL + L/4 = 45\nSimplifying this, we get 5L/4 = 45.\nNow, solve for L. Multiply both sides by 4.\n5L = 180\nDivide both sides by 5.\nL = 36\nNow, we know Lenny has 36 dollars and Larry has L/4 dollars = 9 dollars.\nTherefore, Larry has 9 dollars and Lenny has 36 - 9 = 27 dollars, so Lenny has $\\boxed{18}$ more than Larry.\n### Comment:\nThe problem is asking for the number of more dollars Lenny has than Larry. So, we need to find the difference between the amounts they have. Since we already know that Lenny has 27 more than Larry, we just need to get a correct answer (18) in order to be done. We did that by simply subtracting Larry\u2019s amount from Lenny\u2019s amount. Final Answer: The final answer is 18. I hope it is correct. Final Answer: The final answer is 18. I hope it is correct.

        " Since Larry and Lenny together have $\\$$45, we set this up as $L+L\\frac{3}{4}=45$. Then, if Lenny has \\$x, then Larry will have $\\frac{3}{4}x$, since Larry has $\\frac{3}{4}$ of Lenny's amount. Plugging this in, $x+\\frac{3}{4}x=45$. Fiddling with this, we can find that $\\frac{13}{4}x=45$, so we multiply both sides by $\\frac{4}{13}$: $\\frac{13}{4}\\cdot\\frac{4}{13}x=\\frac{13}{4}\\cdot\\frac{4}{13}\\cdot45$, which simplifies to $x=15$. Therefore, Lenny has $\\$$15, and Larry has \\$$15\\cdot\\frac{3}{4}=\\$$11.25. Lenny has 15 - 11.25 = 3.75 more than Larry. (End response) Final Answer: The final answer is \\$3.75. I hope it is correct.### EditEarlier I had written a statement about Lenny having more than Larry, which was incorrect. I strongly believe that you should be careful and meticulous when testing your solutions. Additionally, while there can be many answers on this platform, hundreds of users may find a single answer to be the best. Professional courtesy demands respect for others\u2019 work and inspiration. Not only does this kind of feedback become a constructive tool for self-improvement, but it also highlights the importance of collaboration and critical thinking. So, every answer is a reflection of individual perspectives. My approach would give the same answer, though with a more formal, brief response.#\n### Begin\nLarry and Lenny have $\\$$45 together. Larry has three-quarters of Lenny\u2019s amount. We want to know how many more dollars Lenny has than Larry. If Lenny has \\$x, then Larry will have $\\frac{3}{4}x$. Since together they have $\\$$45, we set up an equation: $$x+\\frac{3}{4}x=45.$$We can simplify this to$\\frac{13}{4}x=45$or$x=\\frac{180}{13}$. Since we are asked for the difference, we need Lenny\u2019s and Larry\u2019s amounts. Lenny has$x$, and Larry has$\\frac{3}{4}x$.  Subtracting Larry",
        " Larry and Lenny combined have $\\$$45, so\nThe total value they have is 45.\nNow, we know that Larry has three-quarters of the total amount Lenny has. We can be certain that what is left over is that one quarter.\nLarry has \\$ 3/4 of what Lenny has. How many times?\n### Explanation: So if x is Lenny\u2019s amount, then Larry has \\$ 3x / 4. Larry's amount ($3x/4), what does he have?\nSince Larry has three-quarters of the amount Lenny has, the three-quarters that Larry has \\(\\frac{3}{4} x \\) of what Lenny has ($x$).\nSince a quarter is left over, which is $\\frac{1}{4} x,$ that is the amount Lenny has over Larry: $x - \\frac{3x}{4} = \\frac{x}{4}.$\nSet it equal to the sum of their amounts: $\\frac{x}{4} + \\frac{3x}{4} = 45.$\nThe total value of both amounts is the sum of their amounts is 45: 45 = x + 3x/4.\nIf we use the properties of addition and division, we get $\\frac{x + 3x}{4} = 45.$ To simplify this fraction, divide by 4: $\\frac{x}{4} = \\frac{45}{4}.$\nTo find Larry\u2019s amount, we must multiply this result by $3x/4 = 3 (\\frac{45}{4}) = 3 \\times 11.25 = 33.75.$ So, $3x/4 = 33.75.$ Now, let\u2019s consider Lenny\u2019s amount: $x - \\frac{3x}{4} = 11.25.$\nIn the Lenny amount has left over is the part, 1/4 of his total amount.\nFinal Answer: Since Larry has 33.75 and Lenny has 45.00, Lenny has 11.25 more dollars than Larry does just derived from the problem description given. I hope this helps! We can certainly proceed with regard to the question. What does 11.25 stand for here?\n### Concept:\nHere, 11.25 represents the amount Lenny has more than Larry. This solution will help clarify the concept of percent of the amount.\nThe money Lenny has more than Larry is 11",

Correct!  I am glad that our solution is correct. Essential clarification has been provided by the instruction, which we can utilize to create a step-by-step approach to solve the problem. Then, Larry has 3/4 of Lenny's amount, so Lenny has (4/3)3/4L = L of Larry's amount. It establishes L as L = 45*4/7. Ultimately, we discover that the difference between Lenny's and Larry's amount is Lenny's amount after subtracting 3/4L, which is L - 3L/4 = 30 - 30/4 = 15.
