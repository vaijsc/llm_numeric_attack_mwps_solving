The midpoint between $A'$ and $B'$ is $(\\dfrac{a+14+c-2}{2}, \\dfrac{b+20+d-6}{2}) = M'$. Then, $M' (m+n)/2 = m\\dfrac{a+c}{2}+n\\dfrac{b+d}{2}$.

The distance between $M$ and $M'$ is $|MM'| = \\sqrt{(m-m')^2 + (n-n')^2}$.\nThere are a couple of key points to observe in this problem. The key question is that we want to find out what the new point $M'$ is. So we started to consider what happens when we move the two different points A and B. So it is like we start to figure out what the new two points A' and B' are. And it is hard to determine because it is difficult to figure out what the moving patterns of the two points are and how the two patterns are related to the moving patterns of the other two points.\nIf we get used to thinking about the moving patterns then it is quite possible the problem is solved. Then, we find it easy to find the new midpoint $M'$ and then we can find the distance between $M$ and $M'$.\nThis instruction provides a process to calculate a new set of coordinates. Then, it offers a comparison between the new set and the original one. This allows us to calculate a distance, which is the solution to the problem.\nNext step: \nGet familiar with the problem and its representation.

        " Since we shifted $A$ and $B$, their new positions will be $\\left(a+14,b+20\\right)$ and $\\left(c-2,d-6\\right)$ respectively. Then, the coordinates of $M'$ will be \\begin{align*}m &= \\frac{(a+14)+(c-2)}{2}\\\\ n &= \\frac{(b+20)+(d-6)}{2}\\end{align*}Hence, we need to find $m-n$ and $(m-n)^{2}$. We find $m$ and $n$ as follows: \\begin{align*}m &= \\frac{(a+c)-2}{2}+7\\\\ n &= \\frac{(b+d)-6}{2}+7\\end{align*} $m$ and $n$ are the coordinates of $M$, thus $M=(m,n)= (\\frac{(a+c)-2}{2}+7, \\frac{(b+d)-6}{2}+7)$\n### Alternate solution: The best way to approach this problem is to think about the changes of the $x$- and $y$-coordinates when moving from $M$ to $M'$. We have that the $x$-coordinate increases by $7$, and the $y$-coordinate increases by $7$, meaning that the new midpoint $M'$ is $7$ units away from the original midpoint $M$. Then, the distance between $M$ and $M'$ is $\\boxed{7}$. This is so simple that it is almost unbelievable that so much difficulty was created in the preceding half of this paper. ~mathboy282\n### Solution note:\nThis method might not be accurate because when we move $M$ to $M'$, both the $x$ and the $y$ coordinates increase by the same amount, $7$. So if the distance between $M$ and $M'$ is, say, $d$, we know that $d = \\sqrt{(7-0)^{2} + (7-0)^{2}} = \\boxed{7 \\sqrt{2}}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 7\\sqrt{2}. I hope it is correct.

        " Step 1: Express the coordinates of the original midpoint $M$. Let A be ($a$,$b$) and B be ($c$,$d$). The midpoint of A and B is M = ((a+c)/2, (b+d)/2) = ($m$,$n$). Substitute and simplify; ($m$,$n$) = ((a+c)/2, (b+d)/2)",
        " Let\u2019s think step by step.\nStep 1: Describe the two points $A$ and $B.$\nWe have $A(a, b)$, and $B(c, d).$\nStep 2: Describe the original midpoint $M.$\nSince $M$ is the midpoint between $A$ and $B$, we can represent it as\n\\begin{align*}\nM\\left(\\frac{a + c}{2}, \\frac{b + d}{2}\\right).\n\\end{align*}\nStep 3: Describe $A$ and $B$ after the given movements.\nNow, let\u2019s describe $A$ and $B$ after the given movements. $A$ is moved 14 units to the right and 20 units upwards so that it becomes\n\\begin{align*}\nA'(a + 14, b + 20).\n\\end{align*}Similarly, $B$ is moved 2 units to the left and 6 units downwards so that it becomes\n\\begin{align*}\nB'(c - 2, d - 6).\n\\end{align*}\nStep 4: Describe the new midpoint $M'.$\nSince $A'$ and $B'$ are the new points, the new midpoint $M'$ is\n\\begin{align*}\nM'\\left(\\frac{a + c - 2 + 14}{2}, \\frac{b + d - 6 + 20}{2}\\right).\n\\end{align*}\nSimplifying the expression for $M'$, we get\n\\begin{align*}\nM'\\left(\\frac{a + c + 12}{2}, \\frac{b + d + 14}{2}\\right).\n\\end{align*}\nStep 5: Calculate the distance between $M$ and $M'.$\nWe can calculate the distance between the two midpoints now. Let\u2019s calculate the horizontal distance first.\n\\begin{align*}\nM_x - M'_x &= \\left(\\frac{a + c}{2}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{a + c + 12}{2}\\right) \\\\\n&= \\frac{-12}{2} = -6\n\\end{align*}\nNow, let\u2019s calculate the vertical distance.\n\\begin{align*}\nM_y - M'_y &= \\left(\\frac{b + d}{2}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{b + d +"
