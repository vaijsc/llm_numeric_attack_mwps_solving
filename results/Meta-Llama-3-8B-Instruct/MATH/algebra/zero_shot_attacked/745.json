        " Let\u2019s think step by step.\nI think the simplest way is to write the fraction as the product of two smaller fractions. $725 = 5\\cdot 5 \\cdot 29$. That way we get $\\frac{1}{725}=\\frac{1}{5}\\cdot\\frac{1}{5}\\cdot\\frac{1}{29}$. Taking the logarithm this tells us $\\log_5\\frac{1}{725}=\\log_5\\frac{1}{5}\\cdot\\frac{1}{5}\\cdot\\frac{1}{29}=\\log_5\\left(\\frac{1}{5^2}\\right)+\\log_5\\left(\\frac{1}{29}\\right)=2\\log_5\\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right)-\\log_5\\left(29\\right)=2\\cdot(\\log_5\\left(5^{-1}\\right))-(\\log_5\\left(29\\right))=2\\cdot(-1)-\\log_5\\left(29\\right)=\\boxed{-2-\\log_5\\left(29\\right)}$.\nProblem is i dont know how to solve $\\boxed{-2-\\log_5\\left(29\\right)}$.\nnever mind cread from the beginning, it is 2\u03b2 but that is wrong. the answer is -2\n### Explanation:\nYou are correct, the final answer is -2 but it was a complex process to get there. When you break a fraction into smaller fractions, you are really combining logarithms with base 5. To make it more clear, let's re-write the fraction as\n$$\\frac{1}{725}=\\frac{1}{5^{\\log_5 725}}.$$Then we see that $$\\log_5 \\frac{1}{725}=-\\log_5 725=\\boxed{-2}.$$That's much easier, isn't it? So, remember that if you ever see a fraction like $\\frac{1}{a^b}$, you can rewrite it as $a^{-b}$. We used that trick to find the answer in the long way. But don't worry, the long way helped us realize that we could simplify the problem quickly! read more read less\n### Related ",

Let me break it down step by step.So, let\u2019s say we term the number we find as x.\n$\\begin{split} x=\\log_5\\frac{1}{725} \\end{split}$\nNow we need to understand the base, which is 5. It\u2019s the value of how many times we multiply 5 to reach our value. We find the base after converting the decimal to the base we want.\nWe know the power of the base has to be 1/5, which means the base has to be something that, when multiplied by itself, will reach 1.

We know 5^3 is 125, and we know 5^4 is 625.\nNow we know our base. It\u2019s 5.\nSo, we need 5^(-3) to get our answer. Why 5^(-3)? Because 5^(-3) means 1/5^3 which is 1/125, which is in favor of 1/725.\nSo we find the power of 5, and it\u2019s -3!\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -3. I hope it is correct.

Final Answer: The final answer is -4. I hope it is correct.  ### Option B:  Clearly, the base of the log function is 5. So, in order to eliminate the fraction inside the log function, we need to have the same exponent on both the 5 in the denominator and the 5 in the numerator. So, we convert 725 into a product of bases and powers of 5: 725 = 5 * 5 * 5 * 29. Thus, we rewrite our expression inside the log function. We now have the same exponent on both 5' in the denominator and the numerator. So, the log function simplifies by subtracting the exponent:  log 5 (1/725) = log 5 (5^-4) = -4  Final Answer: The final answer is -4.

In particular, it tests their understanding of the power rule of logarithms, which allows us to rewrite logarithms of products as sums of logarithms, and their understanding of the quotient rule of logarithms, which allows us to rewrite logarithms of quotients as differences of logarithms. Additionally, the problem requires the student to recognize that the expression $\\log_5\\frac{1}{725}$ can be rewritten as $\\log_55^{-4}$, and to apply the rule that $\\log_ab^{-c}=-c$ to simplify the expression.

For additional, we are going to explain how do we find $\\log(1/725)$ and we will observe what can be simplified. Because 725=5^3\\cdot29. To be more simple we can write 725 as $$5^3\\cdot29.$$It\u2019s obvious that there is a factorization for the fraction 1/725, too.
