        " \nWe are given that $g(x) = 3x - 4$.\nWe want to find $g(2)$.\nWe can do this by replacing $x$ with $2$ in the function.\n$g(2) = 3 \\cdot 2 - 4$\n$g(2) = 6 - 4$\n$g(2) = 2$\nSo, the answer is 2. \n### Step 2: \nConsider the function $f(x)=2x^2+3x-1$.  What is $f(1)$?\nWe are given that $f(x) = 2x^2 + 3x - 1$.\nWe want to find $f(1)$.\nWe can do this by replacing $x$ with $1$ in the function.\n$f(1) = 2\\cdot 1^2 + 3\\cdot 1 - 1$\n$f(1) = 2 + 3 - 1$\n$f(1) = 4$\nSo, the answer is 4.\n### Step 3: \nConsider the function $g(x)=5x+2$.  What is $g(-3)$?\nWe are given that $g(x) = 5x + 2$.\nWe want to find $g(-3)$.\nWe can do this by replacing $x$ with $-3$ in the function.\n$g(-3) = 5 \\cdot (-3) + 2$\n$g(-3) = -15 + 2$\n$g(-3) = -13$\nSo, the answer is -13. \n### Step 4: \nConsider the function $f(x)=x^2-4x+3$.  What is $f(0)$?\nWe are given that $f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 3$.\nWe want to find $f(0)$.\nWe can do this by replacing $x$ with $0$ in the function.\n$f(0) = 0^2-4\\cdot 0+3$\n$f(0) = 0 + 0 + 3$\n$f(0) = 3$\nSo, the answer is 3. \n### Step 5: \nConsider the function $g(x)=2x-3$.
