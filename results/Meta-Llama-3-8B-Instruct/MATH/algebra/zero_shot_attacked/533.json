        " \nLet\u2019s simplify it first.\nThe first expression is $\\left\\lceil{\\frac{5}{4}}\\right\\rceil^2$. Remember, our ceiling function takes the smallest integer bigger than or equal to the given number.

Now, the second expression is $\\left\\lceil{\\left(\\frac{5}{4}\\right)^2}\\right\\rceil$. It takes the smallest integer bigger than or equal to $(\\frac{5}{4})^2 = \\frac{25}{16} = 1.5625\\cdots$. It is going to give us the smallest interval bigger than or equal to $1.5625\\cdots$, which is $\\boxed{2}$. Now, we have $2$. Finally, the total result is $4+2 = \\boxed{6}$. It is the answer.

        " $\\boxed{25}$\nFor the first part, $\\left\\lceil{\\frac54}\\right\\rceil^2=2^2=4$.\nFor the second part, recall that $\\left\\lceil{x}\\right\\rceil$ \u201crounds up\u201d any number $x$.\nBy looking at a calculator, we find $\\left(\\frac54\\right)^2\\approx0.63661977226\\dots$. Since $0<\\left(\\frac54\\right)^2<1$, any appropriate rounding will round $\\left(\\frac54\\right)^2<1$, which means $\\left(\\frac54\\right)^2<1\\Rightarrow \\left\\lceil{\\left(\\frac54\\right)^2}\\right\\rceil=1$.\nThen $\\left\\lceil{\\frac54}\\right\\rceil^2+\\left\\lceil{\\left(\\frac54\\right)^2}\\right\\rceil=4+1=\\boxed{25}$.Flushing out the desfault values show that they can all be sucked back up to $25$.\nFor future reference, the graph shows that the inequality $\\left(\\frac54\\right)^2<1$ is valid for all $x\\ge 0$, which is not surprising, as we might consider the limit $\\left(\\frac54\\right)^2$ being equivalent to $x(1-\\frac12x)=\\frac12x^2$, with $0\\le x\\le2$.  The graph clearly shows this is a quadratic function.  Before you learn this trick, away you go!\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 25. I hope it is correct.  Final Answer: The final answer is 25.
