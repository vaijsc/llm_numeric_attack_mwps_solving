        " Start by evaluating $g(5)$ first.\nSo we can write g(5) as (5+7)=12. Next, we need to evaluate f(g(5)), which would be x=12. Since f(x)=x^2-1, f(g(5)) becomes f(12) = (12)^2 - 1 = 144 - 1 = 143. Now we are ready to evaluate f(4). So f(4) = (4)^2 - 1 = 16 - 1 = 15. Finally, we can evaluate g(f(4)). So, $g(f(4)) = g(15) = 15+7 = 22.$ Therefore, $f(g(5)) + g(f(4)) = 143 + 22 = \\boxed{165}.$",

Then, we can evaluate $f(g(5)) = f(12) = 12^2-1 = 144-1 = 143$.\nTo evaluate the second expression $g(f(4))$, we have to calculate the value of $f(4)$ first, which is $f(4) = 4^2-1 = 15$. Then, we can evaluate $g(f(4)) = g(15) = 15+7 = 22$.\nAdding them together, we have:\nf(g(5))+g(f(4))=143+22=165.\nSo, the value of $f(g(5))+g(f(4))$ is $\\boxed{165}$. \n### There you have it!

In this case, the final answer: f(g(5)) + g(f(4)) = 143 + 18 = 161 was hard to read. In addition to good punctuation and spacing, DO USE NICE MATH NOTATION. FOR EXAMPLE, write **143 + 18 = 161** instead of 143+18=161. Today, problem solvers are not immersed in the printed word. We are used to seeing text on our phones and computers. We want our text to be \"readable\" in black and white, as well as in color.### Geoff Chussil\nSi\u00e2n R. Johnson\n\u2022 Number of co-authors: 1\n\u2022 Affiliation: University of California at Irvine\nSi\u00e2n R. Johnson\nThis handout, along with the accompanying \"Advice,\" is meant to serve as a gentle reminder to writers to maintain clarity, readability, and consistency in their text. The use of good punctuation, spacing, and notation should be a vital part of any writer's toolkit. By doing so, writers can create a more enjoyable and effective reading experience for their audience. Thus, it is essential to make our writing clear, easy to follow, and aesthetically pleasing. In conclusion, effective writing not only requires strong content, but also consideration of presentation and style.### Problem solver's perspective:\nWhat I find interesting is that distance education and digital technologies have not only changed how we write and present our work but also how we perceive and consume written text. In a print-based world, readers were more accustomed to deciphering handwritten notes, serif fonts, and structured layouts. In contrast, digital readers are more accustomed to smooth, continuous text, sans-serif fonts, and flexible layouts. Thus,",

Score++)  Answer button has already been clicked\nHere's a way to work the problem in fewer steps:\nLet\u2019s break down the problem.\nThe problem says we have two functions.   The function $f$ is defined to be $f(x) = x^2 - 1$. The second function $g$ is defined to be $g(x) = x + 7$.\nWe are asked to evaluate $f(g(5)) + g(f(4))$. When we plug in $5$ for $x$ in the function $g$, we get $g(5) = 5 + 7 = 12$.   Plugging this into $f(x) = x^2 - 1,$ we see   $f(g(5)) = f(12) = 12^2 - 1 =",
        " \n$$g(5) = 5+7=12$$ So $f(g(5)) = f(12) = 12^2 - 1 = 143.$ Now, $f(4) = 4^2 - 1 = 15.$ Then $g(f(4)) = g(15) = 15+7 = 22.$ The answer is $143+22 = \\boxed{165}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 165.
