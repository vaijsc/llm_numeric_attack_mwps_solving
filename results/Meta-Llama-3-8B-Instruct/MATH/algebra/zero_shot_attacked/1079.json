        " To solve this problem, we can use the difference of squares formula. The difference between two squares is always equal to the difference of the first and last terms. The formula is: $(a - b)(a + b)$. In this equation, $a = 845$ (which is $855 - 10$, since 85 is 10 less than 85) and $b = 15$. Plugging these values into the formula yields $(845 - 15)(845 + 15) = 830 \\cdot 860 = 715,800$. Therefore, $855^2 - 245^2 = 715,800$.",

I hope it is correct.\u00a0 ### Problem: #### Write the following equation in factored form and solve the equation for $x$: $x^2+7x+12=0$ To solve this equation, we can factor it as follows: \\begin{align*}\nx^2+7x+12&=0\\\\\n(x+3)(x+4)&=0\n\\end{align*} which implies that either $x+3=0$, which gives $x=-3$, or $x+4=0$, which gives $x=-4$. Therefore, the solutions to the equation are $\\boxed{x=-3\\text{ and }x=-4}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -3 and -4. I hope it is correct. #\u00a0 ### ",
        " First\nLet\u2019s write $855^2 - 245^2$ as $(855-245)(855+245)$.\n### Students\u2019 Answer:\n$855^2 - 245^2 = (855-245)(855+245)$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 648,400. I hope it is correct.\nNow we are left with $(855-245)(855+245)$.\n### "
