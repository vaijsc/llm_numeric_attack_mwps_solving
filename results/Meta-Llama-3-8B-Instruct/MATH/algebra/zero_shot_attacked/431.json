X = 20 % of (50% of 80). To evaluate the expression inside the parentheses, we need to find 50% of 80. X = 20 % of (0.5 x 80). Then we can simplify the equation by first evaluating the expression inside the parentheses. So X = 20 % of 40. Now we can use the formula again to find X. X = 0.20 x 40 = 8. The correct answer is 8. The formula approach saved us a lot of time and effort.
