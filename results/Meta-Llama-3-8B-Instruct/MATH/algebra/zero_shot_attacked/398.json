        " The sum of seven consecutive integers is 89. This means that it is the sum of 7 consecutive integers.\n#### Step 1: We need to let some variables equal something. Let\u2019s say that the smallest of the seven integers is x.\n#### Step 2: The sum of the seven consecutive integers is 89, so that means that x + (x + 1) + (x + 2) + (x + 3) + (x + 4) + (x + 5) + (x + 6) = 89.\n#### Step 3: Let\u2019s simplify this equation. We can subtract the x from both sides, so that we get x + (x + 1) + (x + 2) + (x + 3) + (x + 4) + (x + 5) + (x + 6) \u2013 x = 89 - x. That is the same as 7x + (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6) = 89 - x.\n#### Step 4: That is the same as 7x + 21 = 89 - x. Adding x to both sides, we get 7x + x + 21 = 89. And since x + x is 2x, that is the same as 8x + 21 = 89.\n#### Step 5: Subtracting 21 from both sides, we get 8x = 68. Dividing both sides by 8, we get x = 68 / 8. x = 8.5 is between the integers, but our problem is asking for an integer. The smallest integer less than or equal to 8.5 is 8. \n#### Step 6: Therefore, the smallest of the seven integers is 8. And the seven consecutive integers are 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.\n#### Step 7: Finally, we check that the sum of these seven consecutive integers is 89: 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 + 13 + 14 = 77. Since 77 < 89, we know that this is our solution.\n#### Final Answer: So, the smallest of the seven consecutive integers is 8. And the seven consecutive integers are 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, ",

        " In the seven consecutive integers, let\u2019s say the first integer is k.\nThen all the seven consecutive integers will be k, k + 1, k + 2, k + 3, k + 4, k + 5, and k + 6.\nThe sum of these seven integers will be:\nk + (k + 1) + (k + 2) + (k + 3) + (k + 4) + (k + 5) + (k + 6) = 7k + 21.\nWe are given that the sum of these integers is 89, so:\n7k + 21 = 89\nSubtracting 21 from both sides, we get:\n7k = 68\nDividing both sides by 7, we get:\nk = 10\nSo the smallest of the seven consecutive integers is k = 10.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 10. I hope it is correct. Singapare\n",
        " \nIf seven consecutive integers sum to 89, and we don't know what the numbers are, we can try to solve the problem by using the average method.\n#### Average Method:\nThe average of the seven integers is:\n$\\frac{\\text{sum of seven consecutive integers}}{\\text{number of integers}} = \\frac{89}{7}$\nThe average is $\\frac{89}{7}$ or 12.71. This means the numbers are centered around 12.71. One way to find these numbers is to open a gap of 1 from 11 to 13. For example, if we start with 12, the next integer is 13, then 14, then 15, then 16, then 17, and finally 18. The sum of these numbers is:\n$12 + 13 + 14 + 15 + 16 + 17 + 18 = 105 \\neq 89$\nHowever, we are off by only 16. This is exactly the $2^{\\text{nd}}$ to $7^{\\text{th}}$ positive integers, so we removed two from our collection of numbers.\n#### Re-arranging Numbers: \nThe next lowest seven consecutive integers starting from 12 are:\n$12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18$\nThese integers sum to:\n$12 + 13 + 14 + 15 + 16 + 17 + 18 = 105 \\neq 89$\n### Re-solving with the correct approach\n[![](./resources/2022S2Blog.jpg)](https://RequestParamMap.com/me/show.html)",
        " The 7 integers can be written in the form : a , a+1 , a+2 , a+3 , a+4 , a+5 , a+6\n###",
        " We are told that the sum of seven consecutive integers is 89. In order to solve this, we can take advantage of the fact that the middle number is the average of all seven numbers. So let $x$ be the middle number.\nLet $n$ be the first number. Then the seven numbers are $$n, \\ n + 1, \\ n + 2, \\ ... , \\ n + 6, \\ x.$$ Since the sum is 89, we know that $$89 = n + (n + 1) + ... + (n + 6) + x.$$ If we add up all the values, we get $$89 = 7n + 21$$ Now let\u2019s subtract 7n from both sides. $$-7n + 89 = 21$$ $$-7n = -68$$ $$n = 10$$ But we want the smallest of the seven integers, so we know that this is the 10. So the answer is $\\boxed{10}$. ",
        " This problem is looking to find the sum of 7 consecutive integers. To solve, I can represent the problem as this: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. And also I know sum of seven consecutive integers is 89. Comparing both values I got 89 = 28. Adding or subtracting multiple 1. Since 7, multiple 1 and 7 is not difference, we should try 1 and 6, 2 and 5, 3 and 4 this way we will find the smallest integer.\nAfter finding the smallest integer which is 4. Therefore smallest integer of the seven consecutive is 4.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 4. I hope it is correct. 24\ncssext24> Alternatively, one can write $css7+$css8+$css9+$css10 =$css1+(css2+css3)+css4+css5+css6, then 14(2css1+css2)+g of CSS has effective number of categories of CSS. Immediately, CSS $css1+(css2+css3)+css4+css5+css6.\nThen write, the equation as a sum.  After solving the equation css7+$css8+$css9+$css10 =$css1+(css2+css3)+css4+css5+css6. And now, in the equation $css7+$css8+$css9+$css10 =$css1+(css2+css3)+css4+css5+css6. One can have the number of 5 from equation 13.3 One can have 5 categories from the problems that are not older than 5. Indicates that css is not sum level.
