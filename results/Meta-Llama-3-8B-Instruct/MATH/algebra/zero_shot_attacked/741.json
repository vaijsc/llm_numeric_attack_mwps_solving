Therefore, its $x$-coordinate is $0$. We are looking for the $y$-coordinate $y_{-}$. We also know that the line passes through $(8,-3)$, so another point of intersection is $(8,-3)$.

        " The slope is $\\frac{1}{2}$, so every unit we move horizontally, we move vertically up a distance of $\\frac{1}{2}$ of a unit. For example, if we move 2 units horizontally from $(8,-3)$, we end up at $(10,-1)$. So, let\u2019s do that. We move left horizontally by 8 units, so we reach $(-0,-3)$.\nNow, if we move vertically up, we have $\\frac{1}{2}$ unit for every 1 unit we move horizontally. So, in that case, we move 8 units up, and we reach $(0,1)$, so we know that that $y$-intercept is $y=1$. So, the final answer is $\\boxed{1}$.

        " The $y$-coordinate of the $y$-intercept is the value of $y$ when $x=0$. The equation of the line is, $$y-y_1=y_2-y_1+ \\frac12x(x_2-x_1)$$ where $x_1,y_1,x_2$ and $y_2$ are the coordinates of the two points. In this case, the two points are $(8,-3)$ and$(0,y)$. Thus, we have $$y-(-3)=-3-(-2x)$$ $$y+3= -2x +3$$ $$y=-2x$$ or $$y=-2x+3,$$ but we can disregard the first form since the problem asks for the $y$-coordinate of the $y$-intercept which is $x=0$ so, this is asking for the value of $y$ when $x=0$ which is $y=-3$.
