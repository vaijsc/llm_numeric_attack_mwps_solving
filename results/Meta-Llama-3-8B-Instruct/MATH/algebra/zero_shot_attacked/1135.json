Therefore the greatest integer value of x is 0. Our answer is (A). \n#### Explanation\nTo solve the inequality, we first write it as 6x^2+x-7 < 0. Then we add 1 to both sides, and factor the result to get (3x+1)(2x-1) < 6. We can now solve for each part and set them both less than 6, which leads to x < 1/3. Therefore, the greatest integer value of x is 0. \n#### Solution:\n\\[ 6x^2+x-7 < 0 \\]\nSolve for $x$.\nAs $6x^2 + x - 7 < 0$, $6x^2 + x - 1 < 6, (3x+1)(2x-1) < 6$ and $\\left\\vert 2x-1 \\right\\vert < 6$.\nThe minimum value of $(3x + 1)(2x - 1)$ is $(3 \\times 0 + 1)(2 \\times 0 - 1) = -1$ at the point $(0, 0)$. So, at the point $(0, 0)$, $(3x + 1)(2x - 1) = -1 < 6$.\nNext, write $(3x + 1)(2x - 1) < 6$ as $\\left\\vert 2x-1 \\right\\vert < 6$. So, $-6 < 2x - 1 < 6$. Add $1$ to each part to get $-5 < 2x < 7$. Divide each part by $2",

        " 1\nThe greatest integer value of x for which 6x^{2} + x - 7 < 0 would be the integer value of x that just makes the inequality 6x^{2} + x - 7 = 0, and that value is x = -1.  Therefore, the greatest integer value of x for which 6x^2 + x - 7 < 0 is \\boxed{-1}. (We know the inequality becomes 6x^{2} + x - 7 = 0 at x = -1 because its graph is an upside-down parabola)\nIt is true that $$6x^2+x-7=(2x+1)(3x-7).$$ So the inequalities $$6x^2+x-7< 0 \\Rightarrow (2x+1)(3x-7) < 0 \\Rightarrow (3x-7) < - \\frac{1}{2}(2x+1)$$and $$6x^2+x-7 > 0 \\Rightarrow (2x+1)(3x-7) > 0 \\Rightarrow (3x-7) > \\frac{1}{2}(2x+1)$$are equivalent.\nTherefore, it suffices to solve the first inequality.\nSince $x<-7/3$ is not possible, we only consider $x\\ge -7/3$. As the first and second terms of the inequality are positive, if $(3x-7) < - \\frac{1}{2}(2x+1),$ then $(2x+1) > 0 \\Rightarrow x \\ge -1$. Therefore, the solution space is $-1 \\le x \\le -7/3$ and the last number is -1. Therefore, the greatest integer value of x for which 6x^2 + x - 7 < 0 is \\boxed{-1}. (We know the inequality becomes 6x^{2} + x - 7 = 0 at x = -1 because its graph is an upside-down parabola)\nI Would provide a reason, but I understand. If you want, please give me the next step I must find the VI : f(x) = 6x^2 + x - 7 :x \\in \\R \\Rightarrow f'(x) = 12x + 1. Setting f'(x) = 0, I can find the extrema. But",
        " Set up an inequality\nFirst, let\u2019s set up an inequality for the given expression $6x^2 + x - 7<0$. The inequality sign should start with a \u201c$<$\u201d since $x$ should be less than the value of the expression."
