Additionally, I will always make sure that the solution is not trivial (e.g., evaluate an equation without providing a hint at how it was arrived at). If you have any other questions, please don\u2019t hesitate to ask. Thank you for the opportunity to help. I hope this helps, and our collaboration is always smooth and helpful.
