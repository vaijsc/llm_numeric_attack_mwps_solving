        " \nFirst, we know $(x+m)^2-25=x^2+2mx+m^2-25$. We are given that $x^2+bx+4=x^2+2mx+m^2-25$. We can compare the coefficients of $x^2$ and the constant terms. Then $b=2m$, $-4=m^2-25$. From these two equations we get $m^2=29$. \nSo $b=2m=2\\sqrt{29}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2\\sqrt{29}. I hope it is correct. \nWe need to identify the value of b in the equation $x^2+bx+4$ for completing the square. This will enable us to write the equation in the form $(x+m)^2 -25$. We know that a (x-(-m))^2 +a-25 must be in the form (x-m)^2-25 so we can write this equation as x^2 -2mx +m^2 + a -25 = (x^2 -2mx +m^2 -25). Since m^2 = + 4 we can see that -2mx = b such that -4ab =-4. Since b =2m we have 2m=2sqrtremainder(m=m) which is 2 so b=2. Final Answer: The final answer is 2. I hope it is correct. \n### Explanation:\nWe are asked to find the value of $b$ in the equation $x^2 + bx + 4$. We know that we can rewrite this equation in the form $(x+m)^2 - 25$, which is equivalent to $x^2 + 2mx + m^2 - 25 = x^2 + bx + 4$. By comparing the coefficients of $x^2$ and the constant terms, we find that $b = 2m$ and $m^2 - 25 = 4$. This means that $m^2 = 29$, so $m = \\sqrt{29}$. This gives us that $b = 2\\sqrt{29}$. \n### Note:\nIn conclusion, the final answer is 2\\sqrt{29}. I hope it is correct. We can also write that the function can be rewritten as (x-0)^2 - 25, since m=0. But this will give us b=2",

Part of the problem is that I do not have a good understanding of the method of completing the square, so it was difficult for me to start. I spent some time reviewing this technique and learned how to apply it.\nThe problem states that Masha has a quadratic of the form $x^2+bx+4$ and wants to rewrite it in the form $(x+m)^2-25$. I knew that I had to adjust the terms in the middle so that they matched this new form, which I did by adding and subtracting some terms.

So, let\u2019s compare coefficients $$\\begin{cases}1 &= 1\\\\\n2m &= b\\\\\nm^2-25 &= 4\n\\end{cases}$$ The first equation tells us the leading coefficients are the same. The second equation tells us $2m=b$. The third equation tells us $m^2 - 25 = 4$, which can be rearranged to get $m^2-29=0$. The quadratic formula states that the solutions to $a^2+bx+c$ are $\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$. Plugging in our values, we find $a=1, b=-29, c=-29$.

We can solve for $m$:\n$$2m=\\frac{b}{2}-\\frac{m^2}{x}\\Rightarrow m^2-mx+\\frac{b}{4}=0.$$This is a quadratic equation with respect to $m$. By the quadratic formula, $$m=\\frac{x\\pm\\sqrt{x^2-b}}{2}.$$Since $m$ is taken from the expansion $(x+m)^2$, $x$ is the original $x$ in the quadratic equation $x^2+bx+4$.

Therefore, we have\n$$x^2-b>0\\Rightarrow x^2>b\\Rightarrow\\pm\\sqrt{x^2-b}>0.$$When $\\sqrt{x^2-b}$ is taken negatively, it will render $m$ imaginary. Thus, $$m=\\frac{x+\\sqrt{x^2-b}}{2}.$$Again, we can manipulate this expression to create $x^2+bx+4$ in terms of $(x+m)^2$:\n\\begin{align*}\nx^2+bx+4&=\\left(x+\\frac{x+\\sqrt{x^2-b}}{2}\\right)^2-25\\\\\n&=x^2+x(\\sqrt{x^2-b})+\\frac{x^2-b}{4}-25\\\\\n&=x^2+bx+4,\n\\end{align*}which sets $b=\\boxed{\\sqrt{x^2-b}}$.",

I hope it is correct. \n### Introduction:\nThe given quadratic equation is $x^2+bx+4$. Let us rewrite the equation in the form $(x+m)^2-25$. Then, the left side is $x^2+bx+4$ and the right side is $(x+m)^2-25$. Since we are dealing with the same equation, we have $(x+m)^2= x^2+bx+4+25=x^2+bx+29$. Now, expanding $(x+m)^2$ gives $(x+m)^2=x^2+2mx+m^2$. Therefore, we have $x^2+2mx+m^2=x^2+bx+29$. Since both sides have $x^2$ terms, we can compare them. Thus, the left side has $x^2$ term equal to $x^2+2mx$, so $b$ must equal $2m$.\nAlso, since we have expanded $(x+m)^2$ in terms of $m$ and expanded the left side in terms of $b$, we can now compare the terms $m^2$ and $4$. This yields $m^2=4+25=29$, which means $m=\\sqrt{29}$. Thus, $b=2m=2\\sqrt{29}$.",
        " \nWe want to have the quadratic $x^2+bx+4$ in the form $(x+m)^2-25.$\nWe can see that $x^2+bx+4 = (x+m)^2-25$ can be expanded as $(x+m)^2-25 = x^2+2xm+m^2-25.$\nWe can see that $x^2+2xm+m^2-25 = x^2+bx+4.$\nUsing this equation, we can set $2xm = bx$ to simplify the equation.\nDividing $bx$ by $2x$ gives $m = \\frac{b}{2}.$\nSince we know $m$ is specific positive number, we can set $m = \\frac{b}{2} = \\frac{b}{2}.$\nThis simplifies to $b = 2m.$\nFurthermore, we can simplify $x^2+bx+4 = (x+m)^2-25$ to get $x^2 + bx +4 = x^2 + 2xm + m^2 - 25.$\nThis simplifies further to $x^2 + bx + 4 = x^2 + 2\\left(\\frac{b}{2}\\right)x + \\left(\\frac{b}{2}\\right)^2 - 25.$\nWe can equate each side of the equation to get $b = 2m.$\nPlugging in the value $b = 2m,$ we get $2m = 2m.$\nTherefore, the equation $x^2+bx+4 = (x+m)^2-25$ can be simplified to $x^2+bx+4 = x^2+2\\left(\\frac{b}{2}\\right)x+\\left(\\frac{b}{2}\\right)^2-25.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2m.
