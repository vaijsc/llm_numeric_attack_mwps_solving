        "\u00a0The degree of $f(x)$ is 3 and that of $g(x)$ is 2.  Therefore, when $f(x)$ is subtracted from $g(x)$, the leading term of $g(x)$ will be cancelled out, and what is left are the terms of degree 3 of $f(x)$, so the degree is $\\boxed{3}$.",
        " \nSince the degree of polynomial $g(x)$ is 2, say $g(x)=ax^2+bx+c$ for constants $a$, $b$ and $c$, then the degree of polynomial $g(x)$ can be thought of as the highest power of $x$ in its expression. Also since $f(x)$ is polynomial of degree 3, after subtraction, $f(x)-g(x)=f(x)-ax^2-bx-c$, the highest power of $x$ will be the degree of polynomial $f(x)-g(x)$, which is the degree of polynomial $f(x)$.",
        " The degree remains the same, which is 3.\nWe know that degree of a polynomial is the highest power of its variable, in this case $x$. $f(x)$ is a cubic polynomial, so its degree is 3. $g(x)$ is a quadratic polynomial, so its degree is 2.\nWhen you subtract a polynomial of degree 2 from a polynomial of degree 3, the result is still a polynomial of degree 3. Here, the term $g(x)$ will not reduce the degree of $f(x)$.\nIn other words, a cubic minus a quadratic is still a cubic.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 3. I hope it is correct.  Let $f(x)=\\sum_{k=0}^3a_kx^k$, $g(x)=\\sum_{k=0}^2b_kx^k$, and let $r(x)=f(x)-g(x)=\\sum_{k=0}^3a_kx^k-\\sum_{k=0}^2b_kx^k$.\nHere, $r(x)=\\sum_{k=0}^3a_kx^k-\\sum_{k=0}^2b_kx^k=\\sum_{k=0}^3a_kx^k-\\sum_{k=0}^2b_kx^k=\\sum_{k=0}^3a_kx^k-\\sum_{k=0}^2b_kx^k$.\nTherefore, the degree of $f(x)-g(x)=r(x)$, which is the largest power of $x$, is 3.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 3.

You explained it step by step, and every step is correct.\nThank you for responding. If you want to check the accuracy of your answer, I would recommend verifying that it agrees with a numerical example. For instance, consider $f(x) = x^3 - 2x^2 + x + 1$ and $g(x) = x^2 - 3x + 2$.

        " \nThe degree of the polynomial $f(x)-g(x)$ is equal to the maximum of the degrees of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ minus one. \nBecause the polynomial $f(x)$ is of degree 3, it has the form $ax^3+bx^2+cx+d$, where $a, b, c$, and $d$ are some constants. \nSimilarly, because the polynomial $g(x)$ is of degree 2, it has the form $px^2+qx+r$, where $p, q$, and $r$ are some other constants.\nSo, $f(x) - g(x)$ has the form $(ax^3+bx^2+cx+d)- (px^2+qx+r) = ax^3+(b-p)x^2+(c-q)x+(d-r)$.\nThe degree of this new polynomial is $\\boxed{3}$. \n### Explanation: \nThe polynomial $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3, and $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 2. \nThis means that the highest degree term in $f(x)$ is $ax^3$, and the highest degree term in $g(x)$ is $px^2$.\nWhen we subtract $g(x)$ from $f(x)$, we will be removing the degree 2 term from the polynomial $f(x)$, so we are left with the degree 3 term, along with the lower degree terms that are already present in $f(x)$.\nTherefore, the degree of $f(x) - g(x)$ is the same as the degree of $f(x)$, which is $\\boxed{3}$. \n### Final Answer: \nThe final answer is 3. I hope it is correct. \n### Clarification: \nWe are only removing one term, the term of the highest degree of $g(x)$, so the degree of the resulting polynomial is still the same as the degree of $f(x)$. We are not combining powers of $x$. \n### Note: \nIf we were to subtract $f(x)$ from $g(x)$, the degree of the resulting polynomial would be the degree of $g(x)$, which is 2. This means that subtracting a higher degree polynomial from a lower degree polynomial can decrease the degree of the resulting polynomial. However, when subtracting polynomials of the same or lower degree, the degree of the resulting polynomial is still the same as the degree of the",

        " The degree of polynomial $f(x)$ is 3, and the degree of polynomial $g(x)$ is 2. When we subtract $g(x)$ from $f(x)$, the degree of the difference is the higher degree, which is 3. Therefore, the degree of polynomial $f(x)-g(x)$ is $\\boxed{3}$.\n### Explanation:\nDegree of polynomial $f(x)$ is 3 means coefficient of x with degree 3 (x^3) is not zero.\nDegree of polynomial $g(x)$ is 2 means coefficient of x with degree 2 (x^2) is not zero.\nNow subtracting $g(x)$ from $f(x)$, is like subtracting polynomial of degree 2 from polynomial of degree 3. The coefficient of x with degree 3 (x^3) is still not zero, because $g(x)$ is only up to degree 2.

        " \nTo start with, we need to recall that when you subtract two polynomials of the same degree, the degree does not change (it's like subtracting integrals that are functions). Therefore, we can conclude that the degree of $f(x) - g(x)$ is either 3 or 2, depending on which one we compare.\nFor this case, since the degree of $f(x)$ is 3 and the degree of $g(x)$ is 2, the degree of $f(x) - g(x)$ will also be 3 because a polynomial of degree 2 cannot remove the degree 3 part of the polynomial.

        " The degree of polynomial $f(x) - g(x)$ is $\\boxed{3}$.\nThe degree of a polynomial is equal to the largest degree of any term in the polynomial. In the polynomial expression $f(x) - g(x)$, the degree of $f(x)$ is 3, and the degree of $g(x)$ is 2. Since the degree of 3 is higher than the degree of 2, the degree of the polynomial $f(x) - g(x)$ is also 3. Therefore, the answer is 3, and it is stated in degree 3. So, the correct answer is $\\boxed{3}$.\n### Author\u2019s Answer:\nThe degree of $f(x) - g(x)$ is $\\boxed{3}$. This is because the polynomial $f(x)$ has a degree of 3, so the term of the highest degree in the polynomial expression $f(x) - g(x)$ is the term of the highest degree in the polynomial $f(x)$. This is also true because we subtracted the term of the highest degree from the lower degree polynomial $g(x)$, so the degree of the polynomial $f(x) - g(x)$ is the same as the degree of the polynomial $f(x)$. So, the degree of the polynomial $f(x) - g(x)$ is $\\boxed{3}$. As my analysis shows, the answer is $\\boxed{3}$. Wait, it looks like my answer and the author\u2019s answer are the same.

        " The degree of polynomial f(x) - g(x)\nSince $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3, it means that its highest term is $ax^3$ for some constant $a$.\nSince $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 2, it means that its highest term is $bx^2$ for some constant $b$.\nWhen we subtract $g(x)$ from $f(x)$, the highest term in the resulting polynomial will be the leading term in $f(x)$, which is $ax^3$.\nThis will be because the leading term in $g(x)$, which is $bx^2$, will be reduced to zero, without changing the degree of the polynomial.\nTherefore, the degree of the polynomial $f(x) - g(x)$ is $\\boxed{3}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 3. I hope it is correct. There is a formula that states that the degree of a polynomial function is equal to the highest degree of the term in the function.",
        " In order to add up two polynomials (or subtract), we must have the same degree. So, we can think of $f(x)+g(x)$ as a polynomials with a degree 3.\nLet\u2019s assume that f(x) = $ax^3$ + $bx^2$ + $cx$ + $d$ and g(x) = $px^2$ + $qx$ + $r$ . Now, we subtract $g(x)$ from $f(x)$.\nSo, f(x) - g(x) = ($ax^3$ + $bx^2$ + $cx$ + $d$)$ - (px^2$ + $qx$ + $r$ ) which is equal to $ax^3$-$px^2$ + $bx^2$ - $qx$ + $cx$ - $r$ + $d$ , which equals $ax^3$ - $px^2$ + $(b-x$ $q$ $)$ $x^2$ + $(c$-$q$) $x$ + $(d$-$r)$\nSo, we can see that, the coefficient of $x^3$ is a and that of $x^2$ is $b-p$ , which implies that the degree of the polynomial is 3, because $ax^3$-$px^2$ + $(b-x$ $q$ $)$ $x^2$ + $(c$-$q$) $x$ + $(d$-$r)$ or the polynomial f(x) - g(x) is also of degree 3.\n### Output: 3\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 3.
