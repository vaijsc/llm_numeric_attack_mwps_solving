        " \nWe are given that the graphs of $y = x^2 - 4x + 7$ and $y = -3$ intersect at two points.  We know that these points will satisfy the equation $$x^2-4x+7=-3$$Simplifying the equation yields $$x^2-4x+10=0$$which is a quadratic equation with two roots $x_1$ and $x_2.$  We can solve this using the quadratic formula.  Since $a=1, b=-4$, and $c=10$, we have $$x_{1,2}=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}=\\frac{4\\pm\\sqrt{(-4)^2-4(1)(10)}}{2}=\\frac{4\\pm\\sqrt{-36}}{2}=\\frac{4\\pm 6i}{2}$$To find the sums $x_1+x_2$, we can add the complex numbers together.  We have $$x_1+x_2=\\left(\\frac{4+6i}{2}\\right)+\\left(\\frac{4-6i}{2}\\right)=\\frac{4+6i+4-6i}{2}=\\frac{8}{2}=\\boxed{4}$$",
        " \n### Hint: First we should find out when $x^2-4x+7=-3$.  Let\u2019s write it down:\n$$x^2 - 4x + 7 = -3 \\Leftrightarrow x^2-4x+10=0.$$Factoring this quadratic equation gives $$x^2-4x+10=(x-1)(x-10)=0,$$which implies that the roots of the quadratic are $1$ and $10$. The sum of these roots is $11$, the $x$-coordinate of the $x$-intercepts of the parabola. The sum of the $x$-coordinates of these two points is $\\boxed{11}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 11.

        "1\nThe two points of intersection must have the same $y$-coordinate, $-3$. So we set $x^2 - 4x + 7 = -3$. We can rearrange the terms: \\begin{align*}\nx^2 - 4x + 7 &= -3 \\\\\nx^2 - 4x + 10 &= 0\n\\end{align*}Using the quadratic formula, we find\n$$x = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4(1)(10)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{-36}}{2} = \\frac{4 \\pm 6i}{2} = 2 \\pm 3i.$$\nThe sum of the $x$-coordinates is therefore $\\boxed{2}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2.

        " Well, this response is actually incorrect but it can be seen as a valid guess for this problem. Let the two points be \\((x_1, -3)\\) and \\((x_2, -3)\\). Then from \\(y = x^2 - 4x + 7\\), we have\n$$-3 = x_1^2 - 4x_1 + 7,-3 = x_2^2 - 4x_2 + 7.$$Rearrange these into quadratic form, respectively, as $$(x_1-2)^2+1=0,\\boxed{(x_2-2)^2+1=0}.$$Thus, we get that $$x_1=x_2=2.$$Then the sum of the two $x$-coordinates is simply \\boxed{2+2=4}. My Solution Jonathan and Max solved the equation by expanding the term out\nSince it is just 1 away from 0, that means that $2^2-4*2+7=-3$, so it is just (x-2)^2. The answer is 4, because there are two points where it intersects, (2,-3) and (2,-3). Final Answer: The final answer is 4. I hope it is correct. My Solution: Additionally, you could solve the quadratic equation to solve for x and look for the two solutions. My answer is 4. Final Answer: The final answer is 4. I hope it is correct. I am going through and looking for solutions but I wasted some time on this one.\nWe can also solve by factorizing the equation for x.\n\\begin{align*}\ny&=x^2 - 4x + 7\\\\\ny&=x^2 - 4x + 4 -3\\\\\n&=(x-2)^2-3\n\\end{align*}This implies that $y=-3$ only when $(x-2)^2=3$. Now let\u2019s square root both sides. $x-2=\\pm\\sqrt{3}$ and then add 2 to both sides.\\begin{align*}x-2&=\\pm\\sqrt{3}\\\\\nx&=2\\pm\\sqrt{3}\n\\end{align*}These are the x-coordinates of the two points. Now we need to add the two to give us x_1+x_2=\\boxed{4",
        " First of all we notice that we are looking at $x$-coordinates which means we are looking at $x$ variables.\n### See the Solution\n$y = x^2 - 4x + 7$ and $y = -3$, so $x^2 - 4x + 7 = -3$, and $x^2 - 4x + 10 = 0$.\nNow the problem requires us to find the two roots of $x^2 - 4x + 10 = 0$ as they are the $x$-coordinates of the desired points.\nWe know that $x^2 - 4x + 4 = (x - 2)^2$, so we can rewrite our equation:\n$$x^2 - 4x + 10 = (x - 2)^2 + 6$$\nIt looks like there are two choices we can take:\nChoice 1: $x^2 - 4x + 10 = (x - 2)^2 + 6 \\geq 6$, because $x^2 - 4x + 10$ has a negative discriminant.\n Choice 2: $x^2 - 4x + 10 = (x - 2)^2 + 6 \\leq 6$, because $x^2 - 4x + 10$ has a positive discriminant.\nWe take Choice 2:\n$$x^2 - 4x + 10 = (x - 2)^2 + 6$$\n$$x^2 - 4x = -4$$\n$$x^2 - 4x + 4 = (x - 2)^2$$\nSo now we know that $x = 1$ or $x = 2$.\nThus, the two solutions to $x^2 - 4x + 10 = 0$ are $1$ and $2$.
