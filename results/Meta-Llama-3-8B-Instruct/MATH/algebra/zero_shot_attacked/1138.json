        " 1, 2, 3\n#### Step 1\nWe are told that $y=ax^2+bx+c$ passes through points $(1,5)$, $(1,10)$, and $(2,19)$. From the condition that $(1,5)$ is a solution, we get $a+b+c=5$. From the condition that $(1,10)$ is a solution, we get $a+b+c=10$. We could simplify things a bit by subtracting the first equation from the second, to get $0=5$. Ah, that\u2019s nice.\n#### Step 2\nNow that we know that $a+b+c=10$, we can think about the other two conditions. If we substitute the values $x=1$ and $y=5$ into the equation, we get $a+b+c=5$, so $(1,5)$ is a solution. Similarly, if we substitute the values $x=1$ and $y=10$ into the equation, we get $a+b+c=10$, so $(1,10)$ is a solution. But what about $(2,19)$? To find $a$ we need the value of $y$ for some value of $x$. So we can plug in $x=2$ and $y=19$ to get $4a+2b+c=19$. That\u2019s all.\n#### Step 3\nNow we have three equations and three unknowns. We can solve for $(a,b,c)$. We have the equation $a+b+c=10$, which we are given, and $4a+2b+c=19$ from before. We could then solve this system of equations. For example, we can subtract the equation $a+b+c=10$ from $4a+2b+c=19$ to get $3a+b=9$. This is nice because we can multiply it by $-1$ and get $-3a-b=-9$, which is the same as the previous equation. In the end, this simplifies into $a=1/3$, $b=2$, $c=7/3$. We substitute back into the original equation to get $y=x^2+2x+7/3$. Finally, we add $a+b+c=1/3+2+7/3=10$, and we are done.\n### Final Answer:\nThe final answer is 1/3+2+7/",

You are saying that a + b + c = 5. Okay, let's try again. Since the graph of y=ax^2+bx+c passes through the points (1,5), (1,10), and (2,19): From (1,5) and (1,10), we get 5=a+b+c and 10=a+b+c. So, a+b+c=5. From (1,10) and (2,19), we get 10=a+2b+c and 19=4a+2b+c. Subtract the second equation from the first to get 9=3a. This gives a=3. Now substitute this back into the first equation to solve for b and c: 5=4(3)+b+c, so 5=12+b+c. This means b+c=-7, and we can use any one of the original equations to solve for b and c. For example, substituting 10=a+2b+c into b+c=-7 gives 10=3+2b+c, so 2b+c=-3. Since b+c=-7, this gives 2b=4, so b=2. Then, c=-7-2=-9. So, a+b+c=3+2-9=5, which is wrong. Where am I going wrong?

Substituting $(1,5)$ into the equation, we get $5=a+b+c$. Substituting $(1,10)$ into the equation, we get $10=a+b+c$. Subtracting $5$ from both sides of the last equation, we get $5=a+b$. Substituting $(2,19)$ into the equation, we get $19=4a+2b+c$. Substituting $a+b$ into $19=4a+2b+c$, we get $19=5+2b+c$, from which we get $14=2b+c$. Substituting $c=14-2b$ into $5=a+b+c$, we get $5=a+b+14-2b=17-a$, from which we get $a=2$. Substituting $a=2$ and $c=14-2b$ into $14=2b+c$, we get $14=2b+14-2b=14$, which is true for any $b$. Substituting $a=2$, $b=0$ into $5=a+b+c$, we get $5=2+0+14=16$. Conclusion: Final Answer: The final answer is 16.
