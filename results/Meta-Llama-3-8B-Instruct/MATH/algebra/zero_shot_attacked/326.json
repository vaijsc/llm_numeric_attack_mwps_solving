        " According to math and algebra, we raise 5 to its own power. In this case, we can write this equation in the form $5^3=5^{6-b}$ and simplify it. The formula says that the power of base to the same power is equal to $base$. $\\frac{6-b}{3}=1$ $6-b=3$ $b=3$\nFrom the question, 225$^{b}=5$, we can write this equation in the form 5$^{6-b}=5^3$ and simplify it. We should solve the equation first then substitute the value. The formula says that if we multiply a number by another number and the result will be equal to itself and raise them to the same power. $\\frac{6-b}{3}=3$ I do not understand this step.\n### Comment:\nI don't understand your step. It looks like you're mixing up your formulas and concepts. Could you please clarify what you mean by $\\frac{6-b}{3}=3$? If we want to find the value of $c$, we can start from the equation $27^b=c$. Now $27^3=343$ and is also equal to $7^3$. So we can write $27^b=7^3$. How can we relate $5$ and $27$? Remember, we have already found $b=3$.\n$5= 5^1 = (3^2)^1 = 3^2$\nNow, substitute the value of $b$ in $27^b=c$, we get:\n$27^3 = c$\nAfter this step, we should be able to finish the problem. When you're ready, go ahead and take the next step.\nMark\nAuthor: Steve**\nNote by Steve**: **Math Problem to Solve\nFinal Answer: The final answer is c = 343.

        " Let\u2019s solve the equation $27^b=c$, then we can come back and solve the equation $225^b=5$.\nSo $27^b=c \\implies (3^3)^b=c \\implies 3^{3b}=c \\implies 3^{2+1b}=c$.\nIn the above solution, I have used the fact that $a^{bc}=(a^b)^c$. Now we can think about how to simplify the exponent of the power of 3. When we raise 3 to an even power or an odd power, it was possible to simplify the exponent of the power of 3. By simplifying the exponent of the power of 3, I can easily find the value of $c$. For example, if the exponent of the power of 3 was even, then we simply had the power of 3 raised to the exponent half of the original exponent.\nLet\u2019s simplify the exponent of the power of 3. $3^{2+1b}=c \\implies 3^2 \\cdot 3^{1b}=c \\implies 3^{(1+1b)}=c$.

        " We need to simplify the expression on the left side. Since 225 is a perfect square, it can be expressed as 15^2, and thus 225^b = 15^(2b). Similarly, 27 is also a perfect square, so 27^b = 3^(2b). Now, we can write our original equation as\n\\begin{align*}\n15^{(2b)}&=5, \\\\\n3^{(2b)}&=c.\n\\end{align*}\nWe now have our equation 15^{(2b)}=5.  In order to solve for $b$, we first rewrite the 15 as 3\\cdot5.  Now, we can rewrite our equation as $(3\\cdot 5)^{2b}=5$.  Now, we observe that the left side of the equation can be rewritten as 5\\cdot 3^{2b}.  Now, we can write\n$$(3\\cdot 5)^{2b}=5\\cdot 3^{2b}\\Rightarrow 5\\cdot3^{2b} = 5\\Rightarrow 3^{2b}=1.$$ This implies $2b=0,$ and so $b=\\boxed{0}.$\nThis implies that $3^{2b}=3^0=1,$ and thus $c=27^b=27^0=\\boxed{1}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 1.

        " 1\nSo we have $$225=5$$ $$27^b=c$$ From $$225=5$$ we have that $b$ is integer.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 3. I hope it is correct. ### ### Step-by-step explanation: First, remember that perfect squares are the squares of integers. $$225 = 15^2$$ and $$5 = 15^2\\cdot5/15^2$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 3. I hope it is correct. LiFang LiFang #### Explanation Let $y=225^b=5$. Taking logarithm both sides, it follows that\n\\begin{align*}\nb\\log 225 &= \\log 5 \\\\\nb \\log (15^2) &= \\log 5 \\\\\nb \\log 15^2 &= \\log 5 \\\\\nb (2 \\log 15) &= \\log 5 \\\\\nb &= \\log_{15} 5 \\\\\nb &= 1 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\nTherefore, 225^b = 225^1 = 15^2 = 27. Since 27^1 = 27, then c = 27, and the final answer is \\boxed{27}. Hope this is correct. 3. WONG Hong Kong. Consider $225^b=5$. This equation implies that $225^b$ is a positive integer less than 30.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 27. I hope it is correct. ### Step-by-step explanation: First, let\u2019s find the values of $a$ such that $a^2<30$ and $a^2>5$. Note that $5$ is not a perfect square of any integer. Since $5<15<30$, then $225=15^2$ must be a valid number of the form $k^2$ where $k$ is an integer. Therefore, it follows that $15^2=225$ is the only possibility. Thus, $b=1$ is the only solution.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 27. I hope it is correct.\n### Explanation\nGiven $225^b=5$, it implies that $b=-2$, a negative integer. This is the only solution of $5=\\left(\\sqrt{225}\\right)^b$, which shows that $b$ is not an integer. Therefore, we have $c=27^b=27$, and",
