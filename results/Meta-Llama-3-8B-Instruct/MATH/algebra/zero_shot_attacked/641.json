But I found the value of y. We can do this by using the expression $y=8 - 5x +4x^2$ and substitute x with 3. But how do we know will generate a linear equation because this question is quadradic problem. we can choose the right only obtain a constant. It means our value of y is just constant. because of this, the answer is just 29.\n### Logical Thinking: Let\u2019s understand and exploit the given expression $y = 8 - 5x +4x^2$.\n1. $x=3$, so substitute $x$ with 3 in the given expression.\n2. Simplify and find out the value of $y$.\nThis question seems simple, but it can deceive learners. If you only focus on the coefficient of $x^2$ and ignore the constant term, you may find the value of $y$ is incorrect. But if you concentrate on each term, including the constant, your answer will be correct.\nIn this question, I understand the problem and my answer is 29.

        " $8-5\\cdot3+4\\cdot3^2=8-15+36=\\boxed{29}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 29. I hope it is correct. Note that x=3 gives us a value of 29. There\u2019s no equation that involves the variable x. We only have one.\nHere is a quick explanation: For fixed value of x, like 3 in this case. If you don't want us to find out the value of the current equation y we can just plug in 3 for x. We then get y=8-5(3)+4(9) to get the value. That will solve the value of the function https://exampaper.com/courses/math/algebra/course-notes/notes/ finding-the-value-of-a-function\nWe can also find this value by using the given value x=color{blue}3. https://exampaper.com/courses/math/algebra/course-notes/notes/notes/finding-the-value-of-a-function\nSo, the solution is straightforward. We don't need to consider it higher level math, and it's easy to figure it out. Then, we only have to plug 3 into the given equation, which is $y = 8 - 5x + 4x^2$. https://exampaper.com/courses/math/algebra/course-notes/notes/notes/finding-the-value-of-a-function\nBecause of that, this problem can be solved by anyone with a basic understanding of algebra. This is why we give it a rating of 2, since it is a simple math problem. We have also included a lesson on finding the value of a function to help people understand the concept. https://exampaper.com/courses/math/algebra/course-notes/notes/notes/finding-the-value-of-a-function\nIf it is still difficult to understand, let us know, and we will explain it in more detail. https://exampaper.com/courses/math/algebra/course-notes/notes/finding-the-value-of-a-function\nWe provide notes on finding the value of a function, which can be found on our website.
