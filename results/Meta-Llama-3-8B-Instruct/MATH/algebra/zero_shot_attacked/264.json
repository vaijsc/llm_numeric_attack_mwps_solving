        " \nFirst, we need to calculate &7.\nThe formula for &x is &x = x + 5.\nSo, &7 = 7 + 5 = 12.\nNext, we need to calculate #( &7 ). \nThe formula for #x is #x = x^2.\nSo, #( &7 ) = (&7)^2 = 12^2 = 144.\nTherefore, the value of #( &7 ) is 144. \n### Calculation:\n```\n&7 = 7 + 5 = 12\n#( &7 ) = (&7)^2 = 12^2 = 144\n```\n### Answer: \n144\n### Context:\nThe problem is from a level math competition, and it requires applying mathematical operations and formulas to solve it. The students are expected to have a strong foundation in algebra and mathematical notation. The problem tests the students' ability to follow instructions, apply formulas, and calculate the result accurately.  If &x is defined as &x = x + 5 and #x is defined as #x = x^2, what is the value of #( &7 )?  \n### Key concepts:\n1. Mathematical notation and formulas\n2. Algebraic operations: addition and exponentiation\n3. Following instructions and applying formulas\n### Error analysis:\nIf the students misunderstand the formulas or the instructions, they may not arrive at the correct answer. For example, they might calculate #(&7) as #7 instead of (&7)^2. \n### Conclusion:\nThe problem is a challenging one that requires careful attention to mathematical notation, formulas, and instructions. The students who can successfully apply the formulas and follow the instructions will arrive at the correct answer, 144.  Hence, the problem is a good test of their mathematical skills.  Arrange your practice accordingly.  Good luck on your math competition.",
