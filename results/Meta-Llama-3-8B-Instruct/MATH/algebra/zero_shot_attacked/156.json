In general, the equation of the axis of symmetry of a parabola of the form $y=ax^2+bx+c$ is x = -\\frac{b}{2a}. Apply this formula in this case, with a=1, b=4, and c=-5. ### Answer: In this case, we have that a=1, b=4, and c=-5. Therefore, the equation of the axis of symmetry is \\begin{align*}\nx&=-\\frac{b}{2a}\\\\\n&=-\\frac{4}{2(1)}=\\boxed{-2}.\n\\end{align*}\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -2.
