Therefore, the total cost is $\\0.50\\cdot x+1200$. To find out the least number of widgets the company has to sell in order to make a profit, we will find the least positive value of $x$ such that \\begin{align*} 2.75x-0.50x-1200&>0\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad 2.25x&>1200\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad x&>1200/2.25=\\boxed{533} \\end{align*}\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 533. I hope it is correct. ### Example: Why did the company have to pay$1200$in equipment fees? What is the profit when the company sells$533$widgets? Let\u2019s try to solve the problem again. Let$x$be the number of widgets the company sells. The revenue is equal to$2.75x$. The cost is equal to$0.50x$plus a one-time fee of$1200$. Therefore, the total cost is$0.50x+1200$. The company makes a profit when$2.75x-0.50x-1200>0$, that is,$2.25x>1200$. We have already solved for the least positive value of$x$: $x>533$. For$x=533$the total revenue is$2.75\\cdot533=1464.5$and the total cost is$0.50\\cdot533+1200=1333$. Therefore, the profit is$1464.5-1333=\\boxed{\\$131.5}$. Though we cannot find the least number of widgets the company has to sell in order to make a profit because we need to sell at least 533 widgets to make a profit, the problem asks us to find the least number of widgets the company has to sell, which is 533.

Since each widget sale does not involve expenses, we only need to go up to $8$ before we make a profit. For instance, we can easily see that making $N=8$ just breaks even. For example, we need $\\$8.00to make 8 widgets.

The $0.50$ fee is paid per widget, whereas the$\\$1200$one-time fee is a flat fee.  So when calculating the total cost per widget, we need to add $\\$0.50and$\\$1200",
        " First, let\u2019s find the break-even point. The company breaks even when the money it spends equals the money it earns. The amount of money it spends is $1200+\\ $\\left(\\0.5\\right)n$,  where $n$ is the number of widgets it makes and sells. The amount of money it earns is $2.75n$,  where $n$ is the number of widgets it makes and sells. Setting these equal and solving, we have \\begin{align*} 1200+0.5n&=2.75n\\\\ 1200&=1.25n\\\\ 960&=n. \\end{align*}\nSo if the company sells 960 widgets, it will break even. Doing this, we incur an additional $\\$240$in expenses, so we make a profit. The question asks for the least number of widgets it has to sell to make a profit. Since we incur a profit even when we sell 960 widgets, selling 961 or more widgets will definitely yield a profit.

        " First, we calculate the cost of the widgets. The cost of equipment is one-time, so we just subtract off $\\$1200$from any total cost we have at the end. With a selling price of$\\$2.75$ and a cost of $\\$0.50$, the profit per widget is$2.75-0.50=2.25$, so if they sell$n$widgets, the profit is$2.25n$.  We want the smallest$n$such that the profit is positive.  If we set$2.25n=0$, we would find that$n=0$is in fact not the smallest such value, since when we divide$\\$0.50$by $2.25$, we find that the smallest value of $n$ such that $2.25n$ is greater than $0.50$ is $y=\\frac{0.50}{2.25}\\approx 0.22$.  Since we don\u2019t have a fractional number of widgets to sell, we can round up to the smallest integer greater than this, which is $1$.  (In this case the calculation $2.25(1)=2.25$ shows that we can still make a profit of $\\$0.75$) Therefore, we can ignore the case $n=0$ and consider the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $2.25n$ is greater than $0.50$.  The smallest value of $n$ satisfying $0.50<2.25n$ and $n<1$ is$1$.$We just need to check$n=1$firstbecause$2.25(1)=2.25>0.50$, so we can ignore the case $n=0$. We can check for$2, 3, 4, ...$.  The only positive integer value of$n$such that$2.25n>0.50$but the largest number$1234567890...$was not found is$0$. Thus$1$is the smallest positive integer$n$.

        " We can first set up an inequality for the break-even point in terms of $x$ widgets made and then substitute in an expression for the profit to get the inequality. The break-even point is at the point where the revenue from widget-making equals the cost. We can set up an equation for the revenue:\nR = 0.5x \\times 2.75 = 1.375x. Now we add up the cost of equipment and the cost of widget-making to get the total cost. We can now set up an equation for the total cost:\nC = 1200+0.5x. At the break-even point, total cost equals revenue:\n1.375x = 1200+0.5x. We subtract 0.5x from both sides to get\n1.375x - 0.5x = 1200. Then we can simplify\n0.875x = 1200. Multiply by 8/7 on both sides:\nx \\ge \\dfrac{1200 \\times 8}{7} = 1344/7. So the least number of widgets the company has to sell is the least integer greater than or equal to $1344/7$. This is\n\\boxed{192.} Final Answer: The final answer is 192. I hope it is correct. $$R=0.5x\\times2.75=1.375x.$$Now we add up the cost of equipment and the cost of widget-making to get the total cost: $$C=1200+0.5x.$$ At the break-even point, total cost equals revenue:\n$$1.375x=1200+0.5x.$$We subtract $0.5x$ from both sides to get\n$$1.375x-0.5x=1200.$$Then we can simplify\n$$0.875x=1200.$$Multiply by $8/7$ on both sides:\n$$x\\ge\\dfrac{1200\\times8}{7}=\\frac{1344}{7}.$$So the least number of widgets the company has to sell is the least integer greater than or equal to$1344/7$.

        " First of all, the company makes no profit if the cost of widgets doesn\u2019t exceed the one-time equipment fee.  We calculate the number of widgets it has to make to equal the one-time equipment fee: \\begin{align*} 0.50n&=1200\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=1200/0.5=2400 \\end{align*} since widgets are sold for a profit if they are produced after covering the one-time equipment fee. Thus, the number of widgets the company has to sell to make a profit is greater than 2400. Next, we calculate the profit for one widget to find the number of widgets the company has to sell to make a profit. Since the one-time equipment fee has been paid, the profit from each widget $P$ is found by subtracting the cost from the selling price: \\begin{align*} P&=(2.75-0.50)=2.25\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad 0.5N&=2.25n-1200\\\\ \\end{align*} Now we solve for N, the number of widgets to be sold, in terms of n: \\begin{align*} 0.5N&=2.25n-1200\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad N&=2.25n/0.5=4.5n \\end{align*} We need to find the least integer $n$so that $N>2400$.  We add 1 to $n$ and see what happens. If $n=2417$, then $N=10857.5$, which exceeds the desired profit, so $n$ must be at least 2418. Therefore, the least number of widgets the company has to sell in order to make a profit is 2418.\nWe will show our solution step by step.

Can we use it just like a magic formula? More magic? ### New response: Ahaha, you are right, my imaginary friend! The expression \"total revenue is greater than the total cost\" is not a magic formula that we can just plug and chug. Instead, it is a fundamental idea in business and finance. Total revenue is the amount of money a company earns from selling its products, and total cost is the amount of money it spends to make those products and run its business. In order to make a profit, a company needs to earn more money than it spends. Let\u2019s use this idea to solve the problem! Let $x$ be the number of widgets the company sells. Then the total cost is\n$$0.50x+1200$$because it costs $\\$0.50$for each widget and$\\$1200$ is the one-time equipment fee. The total revenue is\n$$2.75x,$$since each widget is sold for $\\$2.75$. The company makes a profit if the total revenue is greater than the total cost, which gives the inequality\n$$2.75x>0.50x+1200.$$We want to find the least integer value of$x$such that this inequality holds. Let\u2019s rearrange the inequality to get $$x> \\frac{1200}{2.25}=533.\\bar{3}.$$We round up to the nearest integer since we are looking for the least integer value of$x$. Then$x$must be at least$534$. Hence, the least number of widgets the company has to sell in order to make a profit is$\\boxed{534}$.

        "Solution, Part 1\nWe value the cost of the equipment: $C_0 = \\$1200$. The cost of each widget is $C = \\$0.50$. The revenue generated per widget is $R = \\$2.75$. We define the function $x$ as the number of widgets the company sells, then we can have $R(x) = \\$2.75x$ and $C(x) = \\$0.50x$. Therefore, the total revenue is $R(x) = \\$2.75x$ and the total cost is $C(x) = \\$0.50x + \\$1200$. We then set $R(x) = C(x)$: \\begin{align*} R(x) & = C(x)\\\\ \\$2.75x & = \\$0.50x + \\$1200\\\\ \\$2.25x & = \\$1200\\\\ x & = \\frac{\\$1200}{\\$2.25} = 533 \\end{align*} However, the question is the least number of widgets the company has to sell in order to make a profit. This is equivalent to finding the number of widgets the company has to sell so that the revenue is greater than the cost. Therefore, it means we are looking for the least value of$x$such that$R(x) > C(x)$. For$x = 533$, we can verify that$R(533) = \\$1453.25 > C(533) = \\$533 + \\$1200 = \\$1733$. However, for$x = 532$, we have $R(532) = \\$1451.00 < C(532) = \\$532 + \\$1200 = \\$1732$. Hence, the answer should be$\\boxed{533}.$ Final Answer: The final answer is 533. I hope it is correct.

        "\u00a0To make a profit means that the profit is positive; namely, that the revenue exceeds the cost:\nLet\u2019s say that the company sells $x$ widgets.\nThen the revenue is $\\dfrac{2.75}{1}x=2.75x$; the cost of the equipment is $\\$1200`; the cost of the widgets is $\\dfrac{\\0.50}{1}x=0.50x$. In total, the cost is $\\$1200+0.50x$.\nSo the profit is\n$\\displaystyle \\mathrm{Revenue\\ Cost} = 2.75x-(1200+0.50x) = 2.25x-1200$\nWe want this to be positive, which is equivalent to $$(2.25)x-1200 > 0.$$ to solve this we do the following: we add $1200$ to both sides:\n$(2.25)x > 1200$.

The question is asking for the least number of widgets, not the greatest number. Well done! Review:\u00a0This question was an excellent example of setting up a profit equation. Don\u2019t forget to convert the inequality to an equality at the bottom, so your solution is number, not number, saddle point, or soup. Now, go forth, warriors of numbers, and conquer the exams! Excel at algebra! Much love, your alma mater.

        " 1\nIn order to determine the least number of widgets the company has to sell in order to make a profit, we must first find its total cost. Since the company pays a one-time equipment fee of $\\$1200$, this is a sunk cost that does not change with the number of widgets it produces and sells. Thus, its total cost is the number of widgets it produces multiplied by $\\$0.50plus$the one-time equipment fee$\\$1200$. Therefore, the company will make a profit as long as its revenue exceeds $\\$1500$(the total cost). Since its revenue is $\\$2.75times$the number of widgets it sells, it must sell \\boxed{280+} widgets in order to make a profit. Final Answer: The final answer is 280+. I hope it is correct. 1 mins ago 1 ### ",
        " Let $w$ denote the number of widgets the company makes. Then the revenue is $2.75w$ and the cost is $0.50w+1200$. Thus, we wish to find the smallest integer $w$ such that $$2.75w-(0.50w+1200)>0,$$ which is equivalent to $$1.25w>1200\\Longleftrightarrow w>960.$$ Therefore, the least number of widgets the company has to sell is $w=\\boxed{961}$.

        " 1\nIf the company is to make some profit, then it has to sell widgets until it makes $\\$1200$ (equipment fees) + p, where p is the profit. So, the sum of all the costs plus p has to be greater or equal to$\\$1200$ and the cost of widgets is given by$0.5w$, while the revenue is given by $2.75w$, where $w$ is the number of widgets.\nThe total cost of the equipment fees and the cost of widgets is: $0.5w + 1200$.\nThe revenue is: $2.75w$.\nThe profit then is: $2.75w - (0.5w + 1200) = 2.25w - 1200.$\nSo, the condition for profit is: $2.25w - 1200 \\geq 0$. Adding 1200 to both sides and simplifying, we get $2.25w \\geq 1200.$\nWe can solve for w by dividing both sides by $2.25$:\n$w \\geq \\frac{1200}{2.25} = 533.33$.\nSo, the company has to sell at least $\\boxed{534}$ widgets to make a profit.
