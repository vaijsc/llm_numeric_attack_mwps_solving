        " If you compare this rational expression with the standard expression form of a linear relation: \\[y = \\frac{a x + b}{c x + d},\\]we can see that $a = 1$, $b = -9$, $c = 1$, and $d = 1$. This gives us \\[y = \\frac{x - 9}{x + 1}.\\]Since we want to find the value of $x$ which corresponds to the value of $y = 3$, we can use this equation to set $y = 3.$ \\begin{align*} \\frac{x-9}{x+1} &= 3\\\\ x-9 &= 3(x+1)\\\\ x-9 &= 3x + 3\\\\ -9 &= 2x + 3\\\\ -12 &= 2x\\\\ -6 &= x\\\\ \\end{align*}Hence, the value of $x$ which makes the statement \\[\\frac{x-9}{x+1}=3\\]true is $x = \\boxed{-6}$.\n### ",
        " \nWe have $\\frac{x-9}{x+1}=3$, which is equivalent to $(x-9)=3(x+1)=3x+3$. Hence, $x-9=3x+3$, or $x=-12$. We have to verify that $-12$ is really the solution. In other words, we have to show that if we plug $x=-12$ into the initial equation, we get an identity. Plugging in $x=-12$ gives $\\frac{-12-9}{-12+1}=3$, which simplifies to $\\frac{-21}{-11}=\\boxed{3}$, as required.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -12.

        " In order to have a rush down this solution, let\u2019s work backwards.  On the right-hand side of the equation, we have $3$.  Solving for $\\frac{x-9}{x+1}=3$, we can rewrite this as $x-9=3(x+1)$, and simplify it.  We subtract $3x$ from both sides, and we can subtract $9$ from both sides to obtain $$-2x=12.$$  So we can solve for $x$ by dividing both sides by $-2$: $$x=-6.$$  Now, we can check our answer: $$\\frac{-6-9}{-6+1}=3.$$  Observe that our solution $x=-6$ does truly satisfy our equation.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -6.

I hope it is correct. 8### Other related problems that are similar and have the same solution can be written as follows: $\\frac{x-9}{x+1}=4$ $\\frac{x-9}{x+1}=-3$. These problems are written in the same form as the original problem, and we can still use the same steps to solve them for $x$. We have to be careful in this problem and in all similar problems to make sure we eliminate the $x+1$ by multiplying both sides of the equation by $x+1$ in step 1.\nIn particular, these problems can be thought as $\\frac{x-a}{x-b}=c$, where $a, b, c$ are constants, and we need to solve for $x$. We can again multiply both sides of the equation by $x-b$ to eliminate $x-b$, and then solve for $x$.\nFor example, to solve $\\frac{x-3}{x-2}=2$, we can multiply both sides by $x-2$ to get $x-3=2x-4$, which simplifies to $x=1$.\nSimilarly, to solve $\\frac{x-4}{x+3}=-2$, we can multiply both sides by $x+3$ to get $x-4=-2x-6$, which simplifies to $x=2$. In all these cases, we can use the same steps to solve for $x$. The only thing we need to be careful is to eliminate the unwanted terms $x+b$ by multiplying both sides of the equation by $x+b$, and then solve for $x$. Final Answer: The final answer is 8. I hope it is correct. 8### Solution for another problem $\\frac{x+2}{x-3}=5$:\n",
