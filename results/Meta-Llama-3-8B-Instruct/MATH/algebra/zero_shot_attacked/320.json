The maximum distance from x = 6 is 5.6. Therefore, 6 \u2013 x must be at most 5.6. It is equal to 5.6 when x = 6 - 5.6 = 0.4. Since the distance must be at most 5.6, we can\u2019t have x less than 6 \u2013 5.6 = 0.4, so the set of numbers to the left of x = 6 that satisfy the condition is the set of real numbers {0,1,2,3,4}.\n### Total result set: {0,1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9,10,11}\nThere are 11 real numbers in this solution set.

        " Furthermore, we see that x - 6 = 0 gives |x-6| = 6 and it is not in the solution so it is not included in the solution set. Similarly, x - 6 = -6 gives |x-6| = 0 and it is not in the solution set. So we have the solution set from x = 6 - 5.6 to x = 6 + 5.6. Therefore, we have to find out how many integers are in that interval.\n### Solution: The interval [6 - 5.6, 6 + 5.6] is equivalent to [0.4, 11.6]. In that interval we have [1,10] as the set of all integers, which is 10 integers.\n### Example:\nIn interval [0, 10], we have 10 integers which are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 10 integers.
