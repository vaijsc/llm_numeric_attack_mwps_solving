Therefore, we can rewrite 8m - nm as 11, so we can write 7m = 11.  Therefore, m = 11/7 and n = 8 - m = 8 - 11/7 = (56-11)/7 = 45/7.\nSo m-n = (11/7 - 45/7) = -34/7.

Now we have found both m and n and can compute |m-n|. $$|m-n|=|9-1|=|8|=\\boxed{8}.$$\n### Why the solution is correct\nOur solution uses the quadratic formula to solve for m. This quadratic formula is derived from the equation m(8-m)=11, which stems from the given information m+n=8 and mn=11. After solving for m, we find that m=9, which is a positive integer according to our conclusion based on the quadratic formula. Next, we find the value of n by substituting m=9 into m+n=8, resulting in n=1. Finally, we compute |m-n| as |9-1|=|8|=8, which is the final answer. Our solution begins with the given information and logically derives the final answer, showing that it is correct.### Can be further improved",

        "2\nFrom what we have, $m+n=8$ and $mn=11$.\nSo $(m+n)^2 = m^2 + n^2 + 2mn = 64$. \nWe can also write $m^2 + n^2 + 2mn = (m-n)^2 + 2mn = 11^2 + 2(11) = 123$, \nso $m^2 + n^2 = 123 - 22 = 101$.\nNow $(m+n)^2 = m^2 + n^2 + 2mn$, so $64 = m^2 + n^2 + 22$.\nThis means $m^2 + n^2 = 42$, and in fact, \nthe pairs $(7,1)$, $(1,7)$, $(4,6)$, and $(6,4)$ \nsatisfy this equation.\nNow, $m+n = 8$ so $m$ and $n$ are actually in the set $\\{-1,1,3,5,6,7\\}$.\nWe have \n$(m-n)^2 = m^2 + n^2 - 2mn = 101 - 22 = 79$.\nWe did always think and (m\u2212n) as a positive number.\nSo, the final answer is |m\u2212n| = $\\boxed{7}$.",

Therefore, we can write it as m = 11/n .\nNow, m and n satisfy m+n=8 , so we can write it as m+n = 8\nSince m = 11/n, we can write it as (11/n)+n = 8\nNow, let\u2019s solve for n. We will write the expression given above with 11 as the numerator (I know, weird, but it works) and multiply it by n. This is because we are adding two things together, but we want both things to have the same denominator. But we have the trouble child/problem with n in the denominator and we get the trouble child/problem of having different denominators.\nSo, I\u2019m going to write our expression as (11 + n) = 8n",
        " \nFirst, we write the given equations:\n\\begin{align*}\nmn &= 11,\\\\\nm+n &= 8.\n\\end{align*}\nWe want to find |m-n|.\nWe can solve the second equation for $n$ to obtain $n = 8 - m$. Then we substitute this expression for $n$ into the first equation to obtain:\n\\begin{align*}\nm(8-m) &= 11\\\\\n- m^2 + 8m &= 11\\\\\nm^2 - 8m + 11 &= 0\\\\\n(m-11)(m+1) &= 0.\n\\end{align*}\nThe solutions to this quadratic equation are $m=11$ and $m=-1$. The first one, however, does not satisfy the second equation: $11 + 11 = 22,$ which is not equal to 8.\nHence, the second solution, $m=-1$, is the only solution that satisfies both equations. Then $n = 8 - (-1) = 9$.\nHence, $|m-n| = |-1 - 9| = \\boxed{10}$.\nAlternatively, we can check that if $n \\neq 9$, then $|m-n| \\ge |9-8| = 1.$\n### Installation: \nObjective: Given the mn=11 and m+n=8, determine the value of |m-n|.\n",

We can write this as `n^2 - 8n + 11 = 0`, and we can factor it: `(n-11)(n-1) = 0`, so `n = 11` or `n = 1`.\nWe can now find `m`. If `n = 11`, then `m = 1`, so `m = 1`, `n = 11` satisfies both equations.\nIf `n = 1`, then `m = 11`, so `m = 11`, `n = 1` also satisfies both equations.\nSo, we have `m = 1`, `n = 11` or `m = 11`, `n = 1`. Now let\u2019s find `|m-n|`.\nIf `m = 1`, `n = 11`, then `|m-n| = |1-11| = |10| = 10`.\nIf `m = 11`, `n = 1`, then `|m-n| = |11-1| = |10| = 10`.\nSo, `|m-n| = 10` in both cases.
