        " \nLet's evaluate $\\log_4$ of that number. So, we have: $$ \\log_4 x = \\frac{\\ln x}{\\ln 4} $$\nNow, we get $\\ln 4 = \\ln 2^2 = 2 \\ln 2$.

So if the result of $ \\log_2 x$ is 3, then that is 8, which is 2 to the power of 3. On the other hand, $\\log_4 x$ represents how many times you need to multiply 4 to reach the number. So if we need to multiply 2 by itself half the number of times needed to multiply 4, then we will also reach the number. In other words, using $ \\log_2 x$ and multiplying it by $ \\frac{1}{2}$ and converting it to base 4 gives you the same result when converted back to an integer. So that is why we use $\\log_2 x$ with a factor of $ \\frac{1}{2}$ to solve for $ \\log_4 x$. We are just saying if we are multiplying 4 then we can do that number of times per 2 that is how we can do this and we get the same answer. Applying to this answer, that means we are saying we can multiply 4 as many times as we can divide 2 that is the answer.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\frac{1}{2}\\log_2 x.

To do so, we would set our calculator to $4^{1/10}$ and press the equals button. We should obtain an answer close to $2$. On most calculators, we can find the $\\log_4$ function by entering the expression $10 \\log_2$ and pressing the equals button. We should obtain an answer of 1, which equals $\\log_4$ to within a small amount of error. This can be a useful method in cases where you have a calculator with a $\\log_2$ function but not a separate $\\log_4$ function.",
        " \n#### Method 1: Direct Method\nIn LOG calculator we get $\\boxed{\\log_4{2}}=0.5$",
        " \nWhat do we need to do here?\nFirst, we need to write $\\log_4$ as an expression involving logarithms with a base other than $4$.\nTo solve this question, we can take the help of change base of logarithm formula. The change base formula is given by $$\\log_a b = \\frac{\\log{b}}{\\log{a}}$$ From the formula we can write $$\\log_4 x = \\frac{\\log x}{\\log 4}$$So we need to find $\\log x$ now in order to find $\\log_4 x$.\nAt this point, we can take a guess what will be the value of $x$. If we say $x$ is 16, then $\\log x$ will be $\\log 16$. Since $16 = 2^4$, we can write $$\\log 16 = \\log (2^4) = 4 \\log 2$$ Now using change base formula, we have $$\\log_4 16 = \\frac{\\log 16}{\\log 4} = \\frac{4\\log 2}{\\log 2^2} = \\frac{4}{2} = 2$$ Final Answer: The final answer is 2. I hope it is correct.  For this problem, we observed that\n$$16=4^2,$$ and therefore, the given expression becomes\n$$\\log_4 16 = 2.$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2. I hope it is correct.  So we have  $$\\log_4 16 = \\frac{\\log 16}{\\log 4} = \\frac{\\log(4^2)}{\\log 4} = \\frac{\\log 4 + \\log 4}{\\log 4} = \\frac{2\\log 4}{\\log 4} = \\boxed{2}$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2. I hope it is correct.  It is quite straightforward once we notice that $4^2=16$. We can write $\\log_4 16$ as $\\frac{\\log16}{\\log4}$. We can now evaluate the numerator and denominator separately. \\begin{align*} \\log 16 &=\\log (4^2)\\\\ &= \\log4 + \\log4\\\\ &= 2\\log4 \\end{align*} Now, dividing",
        " \nThis is the answer:\nLet\u2019s verify that $4^{\\log_4 x} = x$ for $x > 0$:\n(for all $x>0$) $x=\\sqrt{x\\times x}=\\sqrt{(2^{\\log_4 x})\\times(2^{\\log_4 x})}=2^{\\log_4 x}=\\boxed{4^{\\log_4 x}}$.\nWhen $x=1$, this gives $1=4^0$.\nWhen $x=2$, this gives $2=4^{\\log_4 2}$.\nSo,\n$\\log_4 2= \\frac{\\log 2}{\\log 4} = 1/2$.\nWe know that if $\\log x = 1/2$ and $\\log y = 1/2$, then $x, y \\geq 1$.\nSo, $2 = 4^{\\log_4 2}$ is correct.\nSo, we have to write $\\log_4 2 = 1/2$\nSo,\n$\\log_4 (4^2/4)=\\log_4 2=1/2$\nSo,\n$\\boxed{1}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 1.
