Here, $b=64^{\\frac{1}{3}} = 2$ and $b^a = 4^x$.\n### Explanation: \nSo final expression is $\\log_b 4^x = a$ and from logarithm law, $\\log_b 4^x = x\\log_b4$. So we have, $x\\log_b4 = a$. We want to find out value of $a$ which is 2. So replace value.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is x = 3. I hope it is correct.### Correct or Incorrect: Please mark it as Correct or Incorrect. \nNote for Instructor: Please tell whether the response is correct or incorrect. If incorrect, please provide feedback and guide the student to the correct solution.\n Correct\nIncorrect\nIncorrect. The student seems to have applied the wrong logarithm law. Here's the correct solution: We know that $2^x=4^{\\frac{x}{2}}$. Therefore, $\\log_{64^{\\frac{1}{3}}}4^x=\\frac{1}{2}\\log_{64}4^x=\\frac{1}{2}x\\log_{64}4$. Now, we are given that $\\log_{64^{\\frac{1}{3}}}4^x=2$, so $\\frac{1}{2}x\\log_{64}4=2$. This gives $x\\log_{64}4=4$, which is equivalent to the expression $\\frac{\\log_24}{\\log_642}=4$. Using logarithm laws, $\\frac{\\log_24}{\\log_642}=\\log_{2^3}2=\\log_8 2=1/3$, so $1/3 = 4$ which is not possible. The equation $\\log_{64^{\\frac{1}{3}}}4^x=2$ has no solution. The student should have been told to check the domain of the logarithm and the rational exponents instead of making this mistake. You can give more hints to guide the student.### Feedback: \nFeedback for the student: \nWe know that $\\log_b b^a=a$. Here, $b = 64^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $b^a = 4^x$. So, $\\log_b 4^x = a",

        " To do this we need to find out how $64^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ is related to $2$ and also how $4$ is related to $64^{\\frac{1}{3}}$. So first, let's start by writing $64$ as a power of $2$. We know that $64=2^6$. So if $64^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ is involved, we should think of it as $\\left(2^6\\right)^{\\frac{1}{3}}$. This is the same thing as $2^2=4$. Therefore, $64^{\\frac{1}{3}}=4$.\nNow we know that $64^{\\frac{1}{3}}=4$ and we are trying to solve the equation $\\log_{64^{\\frac{1}{3}}}4^x=2$. We can rewrite this equation as $\\log_4 4^x=2$. Since we\u2019ve got $\\log_4$ we can rewrite this equation as $4^x=4^2$. Therefore, $x=2$. So the answer is $\\boxed{2}$.\n### Final Answer: The final answer is 2. I hope it is correct.",
