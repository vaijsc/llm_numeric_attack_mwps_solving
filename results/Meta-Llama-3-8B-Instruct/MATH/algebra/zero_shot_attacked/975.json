The midpoint M of the line segment connecting the points is calculated using the following formula:\nx_M = (x1 + x2) / 2\ny_M = (y1 + y2) / 2\nIn this problem, we have two points, (5,4) and (-11,8).",
        " A\nStep 1: Find the x-coordinate of the midpoint.\nLet\u2019s use the formula for the midpoint along the x-axis. \n### x-coordinate of the midpoint =  (x_1 + x_2) / 2\nIt has two points (x_1, y_1) = (5,4) and (x_2, y_2) = (-11,8).\n### (x_1 , x_2) = (5 , -11)\nSubstitute it in the formula\n### (5-11) / 2 = (-6) / 2\nThis gives the x-coordinate of the midpoint = -3\nStep 2: Find the y-coordinate of the midpoint.\nLet\u2019s use the formula for the midpoint along the y-axis. \n### y-coordinate of the midpoint =  (y_1 + y_2) / 2\nAgain, it has two points (x_1, y_1) = (5,4) and (x_2, y_2) = (-11,8).\n### (y_1, y_2) = (4, 8)\nSubstitute it in the formula\n### (4 + 8) / 2 = 12 / 2\nThis gives the y-coordinate of the midpoint = 6\n \nStep 3: Add the coordinates to get the sum.\n### Sum of the coordinates = -3 + 6\nThe sum of the coordinates is 3.\n#### Correct answer is 3.\n#### 3 is the sum of the coordinates of the midpoint of the line segment connecting points (5,4) and (-11,8), and other than 3, the other options are not the correct responses.",
        " ####\n1. To find the midpoint, we need to find the average of the x and y coordinates. The x coordinate is $\\frac{5+(-11)}{2}$, which equals $-3$. The y coordinate is $\\frac{4+8}{2}$, which equals $6$. Therefore, the midpoint is $(-3,6)$. The sum of the coordinates is $-3+6$, which equals $\\boxed{3}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 3. I hope it is correct."
