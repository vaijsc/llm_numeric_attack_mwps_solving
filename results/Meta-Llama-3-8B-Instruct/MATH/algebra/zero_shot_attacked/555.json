        " When y = x^2 - 5x - 36, we are looking for a y value, let's call it y0, when y0 = 0.

Since x2 is greater, the largest possible value of x is x2, or **-9**. \n(Preferably, there should be some formula evaluation in between.)\n### Revision: When y = x^2 - 5x - 36, we are looking for a y value, let's call it y0, when y0 = 0. This equation is a quadratic equation, so we can use the quadratic formula to find the solutions. The quadratic formula is:\ny = a(x-h)^2 + k, where a, h and k are constants. In this case, a = 1, h = 5/2 and k = -36. So, using the quadratic formula:\nx = (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2-4ac)) / 2a\n= (5 \u00b1 sqrt(25 + 144)) / 2\n= (5 \u00b1 sqrt(169)) / 2\n= (5 \u00b1 13) / 2\nSimplifying:\nx1 = (-5 + 13) / 2 = 4\nx2 = (-5 - 13) / 2 = -9\nBoth x1 and x2 are valid solutions. Since x2 is greater, the largest possible value of x is x2, or **-9**. \n### Additional information: you can also factor the equation\nx^2 - 5x - 36 = (x-4)(x+9) = 0\nAnd then, solving for x, you will also get x=4 and x=-9.

        " We know that (x-r)(x-s)=0 where r and s are real roots. In our case, r and s are both real and we can rewrite the quadratic as (x-r)(x-s) = x^2 \u2013 (r+s)x + rs = x^2 \u2013 5x \u2013 36. Now, we can adjust the constant term to get x^2 -5x - 36=0. The quadratic equation formula tells us that the sum of the roots is 5 and the product is -36. So, we have r + s = 5 and rs = -36. Solving for r and s, we have, R = 12, s = -3. Both r and s are real. We can adjust the constant term by writing x^2 - (r+s)x + rs = x^2 - 12x -36, so r=12 and s=-3.pdf\u2026 The quadratic equation formula tells us that the sum of the roots is 5 and the product is -36. So, we have r + s = 5 and rs = -36. Solving for r and s, we have R = 12, s = -3. Both r and s are real.\n### Solution:\nNow that we have the real roots, we just need to adjust the constant term to get x^2-5x-36=0. So, take the factors that simplify to (x-r)(x-s) = x^2 \u2013 (r+s)x + rs. It means that you are essentially doing the reverse of the original problem statement. This will give you, (x-r)(x-s) x^2 \u2013 (r+s)x + rs. In our case, we have  x^2 \u2013 5x \u2013 36 = (x - r)(x - s) x^2 \u2013 (r+s)x + rs. To adjust the constant term, you can shift the intercept horizontally. To achieve this, you can adjust the constant term. So, we have x^2 \u2013 (12+(-3))x \u2013 36 = x^2 \u2013 9x \u2013 36. This is written as x^2 \u2013 r - s = x^2 -9x \u2013 36. Simplifying this expression, you get x^2 \u20135x \u201336. That\u2019s what we wanted.

        " The given equation is a quadratic equation, and we can find its roots by factoring or using the quadratic formula.
