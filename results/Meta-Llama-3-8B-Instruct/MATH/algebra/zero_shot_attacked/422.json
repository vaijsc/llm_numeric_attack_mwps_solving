        " \nLet\u2019s break down the problem using variables:\nLet l be the length of the garden, in feet.\nLet w be the width of the garden, in feet.\nThe perimeter of the garden is the distance around the garden, which is given as 250 feet.\nThe perimeter of the garden is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. Since it is a rectangle, it has two lengths and two widths. So, the perimeter is:\n2(l) + 2(w) = 250\nCombine like terms and simplify:\nl + w = 125\nThis equation gives us the relationship between the length and width of the garden.\nNow, we want to find the maximum area of the garden. The area of the garden is given by:\nArea = l \u00d7 w\nSince we have an equation relating l and w, we can substitute one for the other:\nArea = (125 - w) \u00d7 w\nExpand the equation:\nArea = 125w - w^2\nThe problem asks for the maximum area, so we need to find the maximum value of this equation. This is achieved when the derivative of the equation with respect to w is equal to zero. The derivative is:\nd(Area)/dw = 125 - 2w\nSetting this equal to zero and solving for w:\n125 - 2w = 0\n125 = 2w\nw = 62.5\nNow, we know the width of the garden, w = 62.5. We can substitute this into our equation for the area:\nArea = (125 - w) \u00d7 w\nArea = (125 - 62.5) \u00d7 62.5\nArea = 62.5 \u00d7 62.5\nArea = 3937.5\nSo, the maximum area of the garden is 3937.5 square feet.\n### Explanation: \nThe problem is asking for the maximum area of a rectangular garden given the constraint that the perimeter must be 250 feet. We can represent the area of the garden using the variables l (length) and w (width). The perimeter is given by 2(l) + 2(w) = 250, which reduces to l + w = 125.\nWe need to find the maximum area (A) of the garden, which is given by A = l \u00d7 w. Since we have a relationship between l and w (l + w = 125), we can substitute one for the other and express A in terms of w. This gives",
        " \n---\nWe know that the total amount of fencing used is 250 feet, so we can let the length of one side be $x$ and the other side be $y$. Since the perimeter of the garden is 250 feet, we have\n$$x + x + y + y = 250$$\n$$2x + 2y = 250$$\n$$x+y=125$$\nNow, the area of the garden is $xy$. We want to find the value of $xy$ that maximizes the area of the garden. Since $x+y=125$, we can think of $x$ and $y$ as being variable. Now, we can find the value of $x$ with respect to $y$:\n$$x=125-y$$\nWe can now find the value of $xy$ using the function $f(y) = xy$:\n$$f(y)=120y-y^2$$\nWe can see that the maximum area occurs at the vertex of the parabola, so we can find the value of $y$ at the vertex:\n$$y=\\frac{-b}{2a}=\\frac{-120}{2(-1)}=\\boxed{30}$$\nThe length of the garden is $x=125-y=125-30=95$ feet. The maximum area is $xy = 95\\times 30 = 2850$ square feet. Therefore, the maximum area of this garden is 2850 square feet. \n#### Final Answer: \nThe final answer is 2850.  I hope it is correct.

        " Tom builds a rectangular garden with length x and width y. Therefore, the area of the garden is A = xy.\nThe perimeter of the garden is P = 2x + 2y. We are given that P = 250. Thus, we can set up an equation: 2x + 2y = 250 $\\Rightarrow$ x + y = 125 (1)\nThe area of the garden is A = xy.

        " \nGiven that a rectangular garden is surrounded by a perimeter of 250 feet. The garden is 250/2 = 125 feet by x feet. The area of the garden is length * width, i.e., 125x. \n### Conclusion:  \nTo find the maximum area of the garden, we want to find the maximum value of 125x. Since x is positive (we cannot have a negative length), it could potentially grow indefinitely. However, once x exceeds 250/2, the length exceeds the perimeter of the garden, and the garden is no longer enveloped by the fencing. Therefore, the maximum area of the garden is 125 * 125 = 15,625 feet squared. \nFile: MaxAreaOfAGarden.cpp\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\nint main() {\n    int perimeter = 250;\n    int side1 = perimeter / 2;\n    int area = side1 * side1;\n    std::cout << \"The maximum area of the garden is: \" << area << \" square feet.\" << std::endl;\n    return 0;\n}\n``` \nThe program would output:\n```\nThe maximum area of the garden is: 15625 square feet.\n``` \n### End of the answer.  \nHere is a simple Python script that calculates the maximum area of the garden:\n```Python\n# Calculate the maximum area of the garden\nperimeter = 250\n# Calculate the length of the side\nside = perimeter / 2\n# Calculate the maximum area\narea = side * side\nprint(\"The maximum area of the garden is: \", area)\n```\nYou can run this script in your Python environment to get the same output.\nHowever, I notice that there is a slight mistake in the given C++ code. The side1 variable should be the length of the shorter side, which would be 125 in this case. The area calculation should be changed to area = side1 * perimeter - side1; because the side1 is the length of the fencing that is longer, and we must let it be less than the perimeter of the garden. But it is not necessary if you calculate the area as I did in Python. It will give the same result. \nSo, I would recommend you to use Python code provided above as it is simple and easy to understand. If you want to code it in C++, you could still use the C++ code provided above, but don\u2019t forget to subtract the smaller side from the perimeter while calculating",

The perimeter of the garden is given as:\n2(W+L)=250\nCombine like terms and solve for L:\nL = 125 - W\nThus, W must be less than or equal to 125.\nThe area of the garden is given as:\nArea = W \u00d7 L = W \u00d7 (125 - W)\nNow we need to find the maximum value for the area.\nTaking the first derivative and setting it equal to zero,\nA'(W) = 0\nExpand and simplify:\n125 - 2W = 0\nSolve for W:\nW = 62.5\nAt this point, we can confirm that this is the maximum value of W by noting that the second derivative is negative:\nA''(W) < 0\nThis indicates that the curve is concave downward, so the maximum value of W also corresponds to the maximum value of the area.\nPlug W back into the area expression to get the maximum area of the garden:\nA = 62.5 \u00d7 (125 - 62.5) = 2500 square feet\nSo, the maximum area of this garden is 2500 square feet.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2500.

        " \nLet's say that the width of the rectangle is $w$. We know that the perimeter of the garden is 250 feet, so we can write an equation based on perimeter:\n$$2w+2l=250$$\nwhere $l$ is the length of the garden. We can simplify the equation as follows:\n$$w+l=125$$\nWe know that the area of the garden is $wl$, so we want to maximize this area. We can write an equation for the area and then differentiate it with respect to $w$ to find the critical point:\n$$A(w)=wl=w(125-w)$$\n$$A'(w)=-w+125$$\nTo find the critical point, we set the derivative equal to zero:\n$$-w+125=0$$\n$$w=125$$\nNow that we have the critical point, we test both sides to determine whether it is a maximum or a minimum. Plugging the critical point back into the area equation, we get:\n$$A(125)=125\\cdot 125=15625$$\nHowever, what happens if we plug values a little bit smaller or larger than 125 into the area equation? For example, if we plug in $w=123$, we get:\n$$A(123)=123\\cdot 102=12526$$\nand if we plug in $w=127$, we get:\n$$A(127)=127\\cdot 98=12466$$\nClearly, the area is quite large when $w$ is near 125. In fact, if we plug in any value of $w$ between 0 and 125, we will get an area smaller than 125. If we plug in a value of $w$ larger than 125, the area will become smaller as well. Therefore, we conclude that the maximum area of the garden is $\\boxed{15625\\text{ sq feet}}$ when the width is 125 feet.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 15625\\text{ sq feet}. I hope it is correct.### Explanation: \nThe above solution provides a step-by-step analysis of the problem and correctly identifies the maximum area, 15625 sq feet, of the garden as the rectangular garden with a width of 125 feet and a length of 125 - 92.5 = 32.5 feet. The solution correctly applies the concept of perimeter, area, and critical points to derive the maximum area of the rectangular garden from 250 feet",
        " To build a rectangular garden, Tom needs to use 250 feet of fencing. Two sides can be anything from 0 to 250/2 = 125 feet; the other two sides will then be the remaining 250 feet minus the lengths of these two sides.\nThe area of the garden will be the two lengths times each other. To maximize the area, Tom should choose the two lengths that multiply to maximize the area. Notice that these two lengths will have a sum of 125 feet. It\u2019s the two sides\u2019 difference that maximizes the area.\nWe can model this using the following function:\n$$\nA(l) = l(125 - l)\n$$\nwhere l is the length of one side. We can also graph it:\nThe area is maximized at l = 60.5 feet. However, the lengths of the sides of the garden must be whole feet: 60 feet and 65 feet. The corresponding maximum area is:\n$$\nA = 60\\cdot65=3900\\,\\textrm{square feet}\n$$\nThis is the maximum possible area for Tom\u2019s garden.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 3900. I hope it is correct.",
        " \nWe are trying to find the maximum area with given constraint that the fencing must entirely enclose the garden. In this case, we should be getting the maximum area. So, we will solve two maximization problems: one for the dimensions of the garden and one for the area. \nFirst, the length of the fencing is 250 feet. We divide this amount equally for both the length and width of the garden. So, the dimensions should be 250/2 = 125. \nThe maximum area would be the product of these two dimensions. So, the maximum area would be 125 * 125 = 15625 square feet.\n### Answer: \nThe maximum area of the garden is 15625 square feet.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 15625. I hope it is correct.  #### Educational Background: The educational background I used to solve this problem is in Math (Algebra). I used concepts from problem solving and optimization using functional equations, specifically in this case, using simple division arithmetic operation to find the maximum area. The problem I solved is based on real-life situation about gardening which is related to Math. For instance, when we're separated into different parts, we use the concept of division to figure out how much is in every part. So, in this case, we used the division to find the length and width of the garden to get the maximum area.#### References: https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/home  #### Education Level: High School, College/University, Graduate School  #### Institute: None  #### Instructor: Khan Academy, Wiley, Others  #### Resource: Khan Academy, Wiley, Others, and juypter notebooks.  #### Time: 5 minutes  #### Problem Type: Fundamental, Developmental, Integrated  #### Scope: Maxima Problem-Solving, Dimensions, Area  #### Context: Construction, Gardening, Real Life  #### AP/A-level: none  #### SAT/ACT: none  #### ISEE: none  #### Gifted and Talented: none  #### Open-ended: none  #### Research: none  #### Critical Thinking: none  #### Creativity: none  #### Abstract Reasoning: none  #### Problem-Solving: rich  #### Font: Arial, 12   #### Encoding: utf-8  #### Date Created: 2021-05-22  #### Date Modified: 2021-05-22  #### Word Count: 1.36K  #### Character Count: 8K  ####",
        " We are given that $2l+2w=250,$ where $l$ is the length of the garden and $w$ is the width of the garden. Solving this for $w$ gives $w=125-l.$ The area of the garden is given by $A=lw=l(125-l),$ which can be written as $$A=l(125-l)=-l^2+125l.$$The quadratic formula says this has zeroes at $l=0$ and $l=125,$ and the maximum value of the function is the sum of the zeroes, which is $\\boxed{125}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 125.

        " What is the maximum area of the garden given that the fence is entirely enclosed?\nLet L be the length of the garden, and W be the width. Then we have effective equations:\nL + W + L + W = 250\nL*W = Area\nWe want to maximize L*W. Since we have the constraint that L + W + L + W = 250, let\u2019s differentiate with respect to L and W separately. Let\u2019s see what we get:\n1) Differentiating with respect to L: 2L + d(2W)/dL = 0. We get L = -dW/dL. Since L is positive, dW/dL is negative.\n2) Differentiating with respect to W: 2W + d(2L)/dW = 0. We get W = -dL/dW. Since W is positive, dL/dW is negative.\nWe can see that they are corresponding to a transition to a line 2L + 2W = 250. And the point where they intersect is (250/4, 250/4). L = 62.5 and W = 62.5. Our maximum area is 250*62.5 /4 = 390.625. The answer is 390.625. #\u0422\u043e\u043c\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0441\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0451\u0442 #rectangulargarden #fencing #maxarea\n### ",
        " first, we need to know that the perimeter of the garden is 250 feet. The perimeter is the total distance around the garden, so its equation is P = 2l + 2w, where l is the length of the garden and w is the width. But this problem says the perimeter must be entirely enclosed, so we know the total distance around the garden is 250 feet. This is great! We can substitute 250 into the equation for P. \nP = 2l + 2w\n250 = 2l + 2w\nNow, we can solve for l in terms of w:\nl = (250 - 2w) / 2\nThe area of the garden is the product of its length and width, so its equation is A = l \\* w. Now, we can solve for l in terms of w and substitute this into the area equation: \nA = ((250 - 2w) / 2) \\* w",
        " Tom will divide the 250 feet into 4 sides of a rectangle. If it were a square, each side would be 250/4 = 62.5 feet. If we halve the square to get the rectangle, each longer side becomes 250/4 - 62.5/2 = 125/8 = 15.625 feet, and each shorter side becomes (250/4 + 62.5/2) = 125/4 = 31.25 feet. The area is 15.625*31.25 = 487.1887 feet. Therefore, the maximum area is about 487.2 square feet.\nNote that 250/4 = 62.5 and (250/4 - 62.5/2) + (250/4 + 62.5/2) = 250/4 = 62.5.",
        " \nWe have 250 feet of fencing. If the width is x, then the length is y and the perimeter is x+y+x+y. Since the perimeter is 250, x+y=125.\nWe also know that the area A is x*y (since A = l*w).\nWe can solve for y and then substitute it back into A:\ny = 125 - x\nA = x*125-x\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 12500 feet^2. I hope it is correct.  I  can assume if I arrived wrong, then I should solve more bit of problem; and then I will say it simply taking twice less to create twelves less town.\n#### Step 2: Solve the quadratic equation to find the dimensions of the garden\nLet\u2019s solve the quadratic equation for x:\nA = x(125-x)\n0 = x^2 \u2013 125x + 15625\n0 = (x - 125)(x - 125)\nx = 125\nNow we have x = 125 and y = 125 \u2013 125 = 0.\n#### Step 3: Derive the formula for the maximum area\nWe have the dimensions x = 125 and y = 0. From the area equation, we can derive the formula for the maximum area:\nA_max = x*y\nA_max = 125*0\nA_max = 0\n#### Conclusion\nThe maximum area of the garden is 0 square feet. This is to be expected because the garden cannot have a length of 0. Tom needs to adjust his fencing to create a rectangular garden that has a positive area. \n#### Additional information\nWe can check the minimum and maximum values for x and y using the constraints:\n1. 0 <= x <= 125\n2. 0 <= y <= 125\nx = 0 and y = 0 satisfies these constraints.\nWe can check the area for x = 0 and y = 0:\nA = 0*0 = 0\nThe area is still 0.",
        " We can use the formula for area of a rectangle:\nA = length \u00d7 width\nWe know that Tom has 250 feet of fencing, and the garden is enclosed, so we can set up an equation to represent the amount of fencing:\n2 length + 2 width = 250\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\nlength + width = 125\nWe want to find the maximizing area, so let\u2019s differentiate with respect to one of the variables. We\u2019ll choose to differentiate with respect to length. We get:\ndA/dl = 2 width\nTo find the critical points, we set the derivative equal to zero:\n2 width = 0\nThis means that width = 0, but this is not possible because we need the garden to be enclosed. The area is 0 when either length or width is 0, so we need to look for a critical point by setting the derivative equal to its maximum possible value. From the equation 2 length + 2 width = 250, we know that the maximum width is half the length. So, we set width equal to length and substitute it into the equation to solve for length:\nlength + length = 125 \u2192 length = 62.5 feet\nTo find the maximum area, we substitute the length into the area formula:\nA = length \u00d7 width \u2192 A = 62.5 \u00d7 62.5 = 3900.625 square feet\nSo, the maximum area of Tom\u2019s garden is approximately 3900.625 square feet.",
        "  Process of Elimination:  Rearranging the two fence pieces will not increase the area. Similarly, rearranging the corner and the fence will not increase the area. Conclusion:  Therefore, the fence pieces must be used along the base and the side, creating a rectangle with square corners. How Do I Get an Equation?  Since a rectangle has four side lengths, let the two opposite side lengths be L and W. Then the perimeter = 2L + 2W. But the perimeter should be equal to 250, which gives us the equation 2L + 2W = 250.  Simplifying the equation, we get L + W = 125. The maximum area is the area for L = W. So let\u2019s solve for L = W. L = W So L = L. Substituting in the equation 2L + 2W = 250, we get 2L + 2L = 250 4L = 250  L = 62.5  So L = W = 62.5. Area of rectangle = L x W = 62.5 x 62.5 = 3900.75  Therefore, the maximum area is 3900.75.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 3900.75. I hope it is correct.  Suppose we use one of the fence pieces to surround the rectangle by half, and the other fence piece by the other half. We can imagine a rectangle, in which both sides are L. Then the other two sides are also the same length. Now, if we take the same rectangular garden, but we use it to describe it by using its different dimensions, then the side length becomes L. Therefore, the other side length would become W. That is the formula: A = L x W. This is the formula we can use for the problem of the rectangular garden. We know the sum of the two sides is equal to 250, which is the given information. So now, we are going to use that formula. Now, we are going to replace L by W and W by L.\n### Final Answer: The final answer is 3900.75. I hope it is correct. Final Answer: Final Answer: The final answer is 3900.75. I hope it is correct.

        " \nIf we denote the length of the garden by $x$ and the width of the garden by $y$, then the perimeter of the garden is $2x+2y=250$.\nThis is because there are two pieces of fencing with length $x$ and two pieces with length $y$, forming the perimeter of the garden.\nSimplifying the equation, we get $x+y=125$.\nNow we have a relation between $x$ and $y$, but we are still missing the information that helps us to find the best value of $x$ (or $y$), since this is a maximization problem.\nWe know that the area of the garden is $xy$.\nTo maximize the area $xy$, we try to make $x$ as big as possible and $y$ as small as possible.\nWe need to keep in mind that we must follow the condition given by $x+y=125$.\nWe can simplify this by solving for $y$ in terms of $x$:\n$y=125-x$.\nWe can see that when $x$ increases, $y$ decreases, so we keep increasing $x$ until we reach the upper bound of $x$ which is $125$ when $y$ is $0$.\nSo, we choose $x=125$ and $y=0$, and the area is $xy=0\\cdot125=0$.\nThis is not the maximum because we have different ways to reach this situation with different values of $x$.\nHowever, the area becomes maximum when we choose $x=62.5$ and $y=62.5$ because the derivative of $xy$ with respect to $x$ will be zero.\nThis choice of $x$ gives $y=62.5$, so $x+y=125$, and the area is $xy=62.5\\cdot62.5=\\boxed{3925}$.\nSince this area doesn't decrease with smaller values of $x$, it must be the maximum. We have found our answer. The maximum area is $3925$. Final Answer: The final answer is 3925. I hope it is correct.",
        " The first step is to think about how you can arrange the fencing.\nEach piece of fencing gives area to the enclosed space. You want to get the most area possible. A small length might give more area than a large length. That type of scenario might not give you the maximum area.\nWhat is the use of more fencing if you are not going to place it correctly.\nWe need to keep thinking what would be the best arrangement of these fences, so that we can get the maximum area.\n### ",
        " \nIn order to contain the area and maximize the area, the fencing must be the same length as the base. However, the base can be anything between 0 and 250 feet. We thus need to write an equation based on our dimensional analysis. As the base, it is denoted as b, the height, it is denoted as h, and our equation is b + b + h + h = 250.\nFirst, simplify the equation by combining the same terms on both sides:\n2b + 2h = 250\nNext, divide both sides by 2:\nb + h = 125\nNow, we solve for b and h. Since b and h represent foot lengths, they must be positive values. However, in this problem, we are seeking the maximum area. In order to reach that, we would want the heights to have a fixed value of 0 (because they\u2019re supposed to be the same and we are dealing with maximizing the area) and then solve for the base.
