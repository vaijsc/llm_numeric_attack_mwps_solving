This is an example of an algebraic expression, where we substitute a variable into another expression to obtain a new expression.\n2. Problem-solving strategies: One strategy is to try to solve the problem using a backwards strategy, where we first determine the conditions under which the expression is defined, and then try to solve for the desired value. In this case, we first determined the conditions for which the expression is defined, and then plugged in the value to get the desired result.\n5. Key words: algebraic expressions, problem-solving strategies, backwards strategy.  Have any other question or need further clarifications. Feel free to let me know! I am here to help!

He answered that the largest constant $a$ such that $P(G(a))$ is defined is $\\boxed{\\frac{8}{3}},$ but his explanation is wrong, the problem formulation is ambiguous. Could you please help me summarize an explanation of the problem taken from the AoPS AMC 10 guidance book?

We want to find the maximum a for which P(G(a)) is defined. G(a) must be within the function P's domain. In this problem, P(x) is defined when x + 4 \u2265 0, so x \u2265 -4. G(x) is -3x + 4 and a must be such that -3a + 4 \u2265 -4. Solving for a gives a \u2264 4/3, which is the largest possible value for a. \nTranslation: For me, Allen\u2019s explanation was incomplete. He only showed that if you put a into G(a) into P(), you\u2019re always going to have an expression under the square root",
