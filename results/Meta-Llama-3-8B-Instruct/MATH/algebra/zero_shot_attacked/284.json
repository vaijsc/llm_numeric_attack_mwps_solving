To do this, we must convert $-4x^2+8x+5$ to: $$-4\\left(x^2-2x+\\color{red}{1}\\right)+5.$$Notice that the constant term in the parenthesis is 1, so that we can express the above expression as:$$-4(x-1)^2+5.$$Thus, in the form $a(x - h)^2 + k$, our expression is $-4(x-1)^2+5$ where $a = -4$ and $k = \\boxed{5}.$",

I hope it is correct.\\\nI took an advanced math class in college, but it's been a while! From what I remember, we can convert this quadratic into vertex form by completing the square:\n$$-4x^2 + 8x + 5 = -4(x^2 - 2x) + 5 = -4(x^2 - 2x + 1) + 9 = -4(x - 1)^2 + 9.$$\nSo, $k = \\boxed{9}$.\nYou're next! Can you come up with a different way to get to $k = 9$? I'm sure it's possible!\n(9) If we express $y = -4x^2 + 8x + 5$ in the form $y = a(x - h)^2 + k$, then what is $k$?\nAnswer: 9\nAs in the previous solutions, this question can be solved by converting the quadratic into vertex form:\n$$y = -4x^2 + 8x + 5 = -4(x^2 - 2x) + 5 = -4(x^2 - 2x + 1) + 9 = -4(x - 1)^2 + 9.$$\nSince the $x^2$ term appears with a negative coefficient, we have to complete the square in this case. We add the square of the coefficient of the $x$ term (2) divided by four times the coefficient of the $x^2$ term (4), squared: $4 = 2^2 \\div 4$, to both sides of the equation. This results in\n$$y = -4(x^2 - 2x + 1) + 5 + 4 = -4(x - 1)^2 + 9.$$\nThe only difference between the correct solutions and the",
        " $k$ is $\\boxed{5}$.",
        " \nFirst, we need to complete the square. Note that $(-4x^2 + 8x + 5 + 4) = (-4(x^2 - 2x) + 5 + 4) = -4(x^2 - 2x + 1/4) + 9$. Also, notice that $x^2 - 2x + 1/4 = (x-1/2)^2$ (by factoring the quadratic expression). Therefore, we have $$-4(x-1/2)^2 + 9.$$ Now we can identify that $h = 1/2$, so this is in the desired form. Thus, $k = \\boxed{9}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 9. I hope it is correct. nderstood! If you have any queries, please feel free to ask. Best regards.

        " \nIf we let $x = h$ then we know that the terms including $x^2$ and $x$ become zero, so we have: \n$$-4(h)^2 + 8h + 5 = 0.$$\nThis means that \n$$75 = 8h.$$\nThis means that $h = 75 / 8 = 9.375$. \nIf we now substitute $x = h$ into the quadratic we find that \n$$-4(9.375)^2 + 8(9.375) + 5 = 4.75$$ so \n$$k = \\boxed{4.75}.$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 4.75.

(This is to prevent any tags from being interpreted and make your text searchable.)  A delightfully detailed description of a process, and the solution steps.  You've properly shown that for the given quadratic, the vertex is (9.375, ??).  This vertex point will shift the quadratic to its vertex form. A delightfully detailed description of a process, and the solution steps.  Since the vertex form is y = a(x-h)^2 + k where the leading coefficient = a, and you were given the leading coefficient essentially as 4, your step is a clean one.  Clearly documented and logical.

        " 5\nMathematically speaking: The formula $a(x-h)^2+k$ is a parabolic equation which appears under expansion when the expression $a(x-h)^2+k$ is factorized. Therefore, we need to compare the given quadratic equation http://prntscr.com/mwycgj with $a(x-h)^2+k$. We start by finding the vertex of the parabola, which occurs at $x = -\\frac{b}{2a} = -\\frac{8}{2\\cdot(-4)} = 1.$ So $h = 1$. Note that $a(x-h)^2+k$ expands to $a(x-1)^2+k$. Now we can compare the given equation with the expression $a(x-1)^2+k$. Comparing the coefficients of $x^2$, we find http://prntscr.com/mwycik and we find that $-4 = a$, so $a=-4$. Comparing the constant terms, we have http://prntscr.com/mwycm6 so $5=k$. Therefore, the value of $k$ is $\\boxed{5}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 5. I hope it is correct. ## ## "
