        " First, the second equation $ab = -10$ tells us that $a$ and $b$ must have different signs (otherwise their product can\u2019t be negative).

Solving for $a$, we get $a=\\boxed{10/3}$.\n### As we assume $a>0$, and $a=10/3$ is the largest possible in this case, we have an answer.

        " For any given system of equations, assume they are linear, so, in this case, they are\n$$6a+2b=0$$and$$ab=-10.$$For convenience, I will use the first equation to solve for $b$: $$2b=-6a$$\n$$b=-3a.$$\nThe second equation then becomes\n$$(-3a)a=-10.$$\nFactoring the left-hand side we get\n$$3a(-a)=-10.$$\nMultiplying the right-hand side and multiplying the left-hand side by 1 to negate the negative we get\n$$3a^2=10.$$\nThis is now a quadratic equation with respect to $a$.

This equation has no real solutions because the square of a real number cannot be negative.\nTherefore, the greatest possible value of $a$ is not a real number and so $a$ is undefined.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is a is undefined.

        " \nGiven the system of equations, we have $6a + 2b = 0$ and $ab = -10$\nIf we can solve the system of equations for $b$, then we can plug that in to find $a$.\nFrom the first equation, we have $2b = -6a$ so $b = -3a$.\nNow, we have $ab = -10$, so we can substitute in $b = -3a$ and solve for $a$.\nWe have $a(-3a) = -10$ so $-3a^2 = -10$.\nNow we have $a^2 = 10/3$.\nAt this point we have two options, $a = \\pm\\sqrt{10/3}$\nLet\u2019s think about this. If we choose the negative square root, then $a$ is negative, and $b$ will be positive.\nBut if we look back at our first equation, the sum of $6a$ and $2b$ should be 0, so the sum of positive values is very unlikely to be 0.\nOn the other hand, when $a$ is positive and $b$ is negative, the sum of $6a$ and $2b$ will likely be closer to 0.\nTherefore, we take $a = \\sqrt{10/3}$, so the greatest possible value of $a$ in the system of equations $6a + 2b = 0$ and $ab = -10$ is $\\boxed{\\sqrt{10/3}}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\sqrt{10/3}.

        " Solving for $b$, we obtain\n$$2b = -6a,$$ $$b = \\frac{-6a}{2} = -3a.$$Plugging this back in to the first equation, we find $$6a + (-3a) = 0,$$ which makes $$3a = 0 \\Rightarrow a = 0.$$ But this is too easy \u2013 we are told that $a$ has to be as big as it can be.\nWait! Let\u2019s go back to the first equation $6a + 2b = 0$ and use a more careful guess for $a$. Since $6a$ is positive, we want $2b$ to be as large as possible. We could set $2b$ equal to $6a$, and solve for $a$.\n$2b = 6a$\n$\\Rightarrow\\qquad b = 3a$\nNow, substitute $b = 3a$ back into $ab = -10$:\n$$a(3a) = -10$$ $3a^2 = -10$\n$3a^2 \\ne 0$ because $a^2$ will always be nonnegative. Therefore, from the equation $3a^2 = -10$, we know that $a^2 < 0$. This value does not make mathematical sense, which indicates that it is not even possible. However, since I know no other way to do this problem, I will continue.\nFor $a^2$ to be negative, we will have to take the square root.
