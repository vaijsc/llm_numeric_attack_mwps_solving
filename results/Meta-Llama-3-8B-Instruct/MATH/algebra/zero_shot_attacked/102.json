Fully understanding these operations and combining them will be the key to solving this problem.\nThe first operation is to find what percentage of $\\frac{1}{3}$ of 36 is. This operation is performed by taking $\\frac{1}{3}$ of 36 and multiplying it by the desired percentage. The result will be 12 times the desired percentage.\nThe second operation is to find 50$\\%$ of $\\frac{1}{3}$ of 36. This is simple and can be reduced to $\\frac{1}{2}$ * 12. The multiplication by $\\frac{1}{2}$ can be considered as multiplying 12 by 50$\\%$.\nThere is an alternative to the approach of dividing by two, which considers the meaning of 50$\\%$ as a percentage out of 100$\\%$.\nThis is possible as 50$\\%$ can be re-written as $\\frac{50}{100}=\\frac{1}{2}$.\nDownside is that this alternative will not be preferred in case there are too multi-step calculations involved. Downside: Alternative yet preferred.\n### Common Example. $\\frac{1}{3}$ of 36 = $\\frac{36}{3}$ = 12 $50\\%$ of 12 = $\\frac{1}{2}$ * 12 = 6 So, $50\\%$ of $\\",
