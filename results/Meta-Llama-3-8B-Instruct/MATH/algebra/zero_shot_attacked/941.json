        " First, evaluate $\\sqrt{90}$. \nWell, we know that $8^2 = 64$ and $9^2 = 81$, so $\\sqrt{90} = \\sqrt{8^2 + 10}$. Applying the formula for the difference of two squares,\n\\begin{align*}\\sqrt{8^2+10}& = \\sqrt{(8+\\sqrt{64-10}) (8 - \\sqrt{64-10})} \\\\&= \\sqrt{(8+\\sqrt{54}) (8 - \\sqrt{54})}\\end{align*}\nApplying the Pythagorean theorem to the right triangle with one leg length $8$ and the hypotenuse length $\\sqrt{90}$, we have that $\\sqrt{54}$ is the other leg length.\nTherefore, $\\sqrt{90} = \\sqrt{8+\\sqrt{54}}\\sqrt{8-\\sqrt{54}}$. Because the product of two positive numbers is positive, and we know $\\sqrt{8+\\sqrt{54}} > 0$ and $\\sqrt{8-\\sqrt{54}} > 0$, $\\sqrt{90}$ is positive (as it is the product of two positive numbers). However, since $8 + \\sqrt{54} > 8$ and $8-\\sqrt{54} < 8$, $\\sqrt{90} < \\sqrt{64} = 8$, so $\\sqrt{90} < 8$.\nNow find $\\lceil{\\sqrt{90}}\\rceil^2$. Recall that $\\lceil{a}\\rceil^2 means we evaluate $\\sqrt{a}$ and take the ceiling, then square.  In this case, we know that $\\sqrt{90} < 8,$ so $\\boxed{\\lceil{\\sqrt{90}}\\rceil^2 = (8)^2 = 64.}$Solution:\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 64. I hope it is correct.  (Edited by bkdcoke) \nP.S. - The question is asking what is $\\lceil{\\sqrt{90}}\\rceil^2$. It is NOT saying find $\\sqrt{90}$ and then square it, and then take the ceiling.

        " First, $\\sqrt{90}$ is between $9$ and $10$ (because $9^2=81$ and $10^2=100$), and if $k\\le\\sqrt{90}$, then $k^2\\le90$.

To find the square root of 90 we need to rationalize. We can break down 90 into 9 and 10. Then we can square root of 9 and the square root of 10. The square root of 9 is 3. And we know that for numbers like 10, which are perfect squares, the square root of that number is not an integer. The square root of 10 will be something like 3.162, which is too close to 3, so we can round up. So the square root of 10 is 3. And now we multiply 3 by 3, which gives us 9, so we have 3 x 3 x square root 10 x square root 10, or 9 x square root 100. We know that the square root 100 is 10. So the answer is 9 x 10, which is 90.
