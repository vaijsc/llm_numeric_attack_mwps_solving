Here is my final answer: \nFinal Answer: The final answer is $58$ of the question Since we were asked to find the value of $g(3)$, let us substitute this in the given expression of $g(x)$ i.e. $g(x)=5x^2+3x+4$. $g(3)=5(3)^2+3(3)+4=45+9+4=\\boxed{58}$.\nThis problem can be solved via substitution. We are told to evaluate $g(x)$ at $x=3$, which we find in this equation: $$g(3)=5(3)^2+3(3)+4=5\\cdot9+3\\cdot3+4=45+9+4=\\boxed{58}$$.\nSteps:\n1. First, we need to enter $x=3$ in the function $g(x) = 5x^2 + 3x + 4$.\n2. Next, we need to simplify by plugging in $x=3$.\n3. Simplifying further we get: $g(3) = 5*3^2 + 3*3 + 4 = 45 + 9 + 4 = 58$.\nIf the question was asking you to find the value of $g(3)$ i.e. to find the point at which the curve intersects the x-axis. So if we know y the value of x, then we can find the corresponding y. But in this case, where we have g 3. It is giving us a value that we should attempt to equate.
