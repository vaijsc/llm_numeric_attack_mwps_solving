You then plugged in the value of $n$ to find the value of $t$. Your calculation of the value of $t$ is also correct.\nHowever, you could have also simplified the expression for $s$ directly without substituting the value of $n$, since $t$ is a function of $s$ and $n$ is a constant. This would have made your solution more concise.\nOverall, your solution is clear, logical, and accurate. A minor suggestion is to consider further simplification of the expression for $s$ before",

I hope it is correct. <dd>  You have to evaluate t at n=5, not calculate n at t=5. The better solution, even though its doable now, in general involves solving t in terms of n which we have already done. That way you avoids the mistake. <dd>  That's a crucial difference. Here's how you could have done this in the first place. The whole expression was known, and you can evaluate this expression at n=5. You don't have to have found s in terms of n, you find t in terms of n and then evaluate it at n=5. I hope that clarifies the point you were trying to make. <dd> I understand now. Thank you for explaining the difference. It is very important to keep in mind. So the correct answer is $t=2(n^2 - 2^n+1) - (n^2 - 2^n+1)^2$ evaluated at $n=5$. This solver lets us replace $n$ by 5. Then $t=2*(5^2 - 2^5+1) - (5^2 - 2^5+1)^2$. This is $2*25-2^6+2-25-2*2^5+2*2^5+2*2^5-1$. This becomes $50-64+2-25-16*16+16*16+16*16-1$. Reduce by combining like terms to get $-48$.

        " \nFirst, let\u2019s find out what is s when n=5. s=n^2 - 2^n+1, so s=25-32+1= -6. Then t=2s-s^2 = -12+36 = 24. So t when n=5 is 24.\n### Additional comments: \nwe have s(n) = n^2 - 2^n + 1, t(s) = 2s - s^2, so s(n) is a function of n, and t is a function of s which in turn is a function of n. \nIf you are using symbolic computation, you can use composition: t(n) = 2 * (n^2 - 2^n + 1) - (n^2 - 2^n + 1)^2. Then you can find the value of t when n=5.

        " \nWe are given two expressions relating $s$ and $t$. If we want to find the value of $t$ when $n=5$, we will need to plug in $n=5$ into these expressions. But to do that, we have to express $s$ solely in terms of $t$. So let's go back to the second expression $s=n^2-2^n+1$. If we replace $n$ by its expression in terms of $s$, we can form an equation in $s$ and substitute it into our first expression. $s=n^2-2^n+1=5^2-2^5+1=24$. So now we have $t=2s-s^2=2*24-(24)^2=-480.$\nThe value of $t$ when $n=5$ is $\\boxed{-480}$. \nFinal Answer: The final answer is -480. I hope it is correct.  If you find any issue please let me know.
