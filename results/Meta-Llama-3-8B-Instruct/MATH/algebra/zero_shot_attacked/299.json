Select (How to apply) -> M (More).\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 4. I hope it is correct. Think step by step. We have $2^{4} = 16$ and $2^{5} = 32$ , but we don\u2019t have $2^{3} = 8$ that can be $42$ . However, we could check that $2^{4} \\cdot 2^2 = 16 \\cdot 4 = 64,$ $2^4 \\cdot 2^2 \\div 2^2 = 16 \\cdot 4 \\div 4 = 16$ which does not produce 42, but then we could add $2^2$ to $2^4 \\cdot 2^2$ , which is 16. That gives us $2^4 \\cdot 2^2 + 2^2 = 16 + 4 = 20$ because that doesn\u2019t give us 42, we could add $2^2$ to $2^4 \\cdot 2^2 + 2^2$ , that gives 24, still not 42, but that leaves only 42 - 24, which is 18. So we could add 18 to 24 to get 42, so that $2^4 + 2^2 + 2^2 = 16 + 4 + 4 = 24 + 18 = 42$ , which gives $2^{x + 2} = 2^4$ , so the answer is 4. The integer we want is 4.

        " \nFirst, note that 42 is even, so $x$ must be even. Thus, let $x = 2 p$ for some integer $p$. \nSecond, the equation yields\n$2^{2 p + 2} = 2^2 \\cdot 2^{2 p} = 4 \\cdot 2^{2 p} = 4 \\cdot 2^{\\log_2 42} = 4 \\cdot \\frac{42}{2^{\\log_2 42}} = 42$ . The last equality follows from the definition of the logarithm and the fact that the logarithm is the inverse function of the exponential. \nNow, we have\n$2^{2 p} = 42$ . We quickly notice that $p = 3$ is the solution: $2^{6} = 2^2 \\cdot 2^4 = 4 \\cdot 16 = 64$ , but it is not the only solution.  Since $2^{2 p} = 42$ is an even number, we require that $p$ is odd.

The only thing you could consider doing to improve this solution is to use the fact that the base 2 logarithm of 42 is not an integer to immediately deduce that $x$ is even, which would save some steps in the solution.

        " We can split the powers a little:\n$$2^{x + 2} = 42 \\Leftrightarrow 2^{x + 1}\\cdot 2 = 42 \\Leftrightarrow 2^{x + 1} = 21$$This shows that $x$ needs to be one less than an exponent which is the base of a power of 3. The only number with this property is $\\boxed{5}$, since the smallest exponent with this property is 3, which is achieved when $x = 5 - 1 = 4$.

I hope it is correct.ORDER BY 2 - 1([\\0][1]) --  |Buffer ID|LocSpread|Size|Data Type In the Equation $2^{x+2}=42$, we are looking for a value of $x$ that will make the equation true. Taking advantage of the properties of exponents, we can write: $\\begin{split} 2^{x+2} &= 42\\\\ 2^{x+1}\\cdot2 &= 42\\\\ 2^{x+1} & = \\sqrt{42}\\\\ 2^{x+1} & = 2^{1+ \\log_2 21}\\\\ &\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad x+1 & = 1 + \\log_2 21\\\\ x & = \\log_2 21 - 1 \\end{split}$\nUsing a calculator, we find the value of $x$ to be approximately $\\boxed{4.32}$. So, $x$ is greater than $4$ and close to $5$.\nNext, note that $2^{4} = 16$ and the next power of $2$ is $2^{5} = 32$, and the next one after that is $2^{6} = 64$. Since we want a figure greater than $21$, we can see that $x$ should be at least $5$.\nNext, note that the base of the logarithm is important here. The logarithm is a base-$10$ operation, but we want a base-$2$ operation. This is because the base of the logarithm in the original equation is $2$.\nSince $21$ is greater than $16$ and less than $32$, we know that $x$ lies",
