The point (2,-5) has an x-coordinate of 2 and a y-coordinate of -5.\nSo, to find the length of the line segment, we can use the distance formula. That formula is $d=\\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2}$.\nDistance formula:\nWe will start by plugging in the numbers given to us. So we will put x_2 = 2, y_2 = -5 and x_1 = -5, y_1 = 7.\nSo, plug in those values:\n$=\\sqrt{(2-(-5))^2+(-5-7)^2}$.\n$=\\sqrt{7^2+(-12)^2}$.\n$=\\sqrt{49+144}$.\nSimplify this expression:\n$=\\sqrt{193}$\nThis is our final answer, the distance between the points is $\\boxed{\\sqrt{193}}$.\n### Explanation:\nWe applied the distance formula to find the distance between the two points. We correctly plugged in the values for x1, y1, x2, y2. We combined like terms and simplified. The answer is $\\sqrt{193}$ which is the length of the line segment between (-5,7) and (2,-5).",
