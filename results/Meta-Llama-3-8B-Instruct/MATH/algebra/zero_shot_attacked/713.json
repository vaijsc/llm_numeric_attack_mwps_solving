        " To define consecutive integers: Next, to identify one of the three consecutive integers, the key information is the sum: 87. Applying the definitions, we know that three consecutive integers, collectively, is a set with three members: a, (a+1), and (a+2), where the final sum of three consecutive integers is a + (a+1) + (a+2) = 87.\n### Answer: If the sum is 87, the 87 we can be interpreted as a + a + 1 + a + 2, or 3 * a + 3 = 87. The 'a' is unknown. The sum of the three variables can be rewritten as 3 (a + 1) = 87. This implies that 3a + 3 = 87. For the sake of simplicity, 3a cannot be 84, because it would mean a value cannot be made. So 3a should be 84. The equation can be rewritten as follows: 3a = 84. Dividing both sides by 3, we obtain a = 28.\n### Statement: The three consecutive integers are a = 28, a + 1 = 29, and a + 2 = 30. With this we can find the solution for the product of these three consecutive integers. Product = a * (a + 1) * (a + 2) = 28 * 29 * 30 = 25,440.\n### Answer: So, the product of the three consecutive integers is equal to 25,440.

        "\\\nThe first step is to express the three consecutive integers as x, x + 1, and x + 2. Since their sum is 87, we can write:\n$$\nx + (x + 1) + (x + 2) = 87\n$$\nCombine like terms:\n$$\n3x + 3 = 87\n$$\nSubtract 3 from both sides:\n$$\n3x = 84\n$$\nDivide both sides by 3:\n$$\nx = 28\n$$\nNow substitute x = 28 into x, x + 1, and x + 2:\n$$\nx = 28 \\\\\nx + 1 = 29 \\\\\nx + 2 = 30\n$$\nThe product of these three integers is:\n$$\n28 \\times 29 \\times 30 = \\boxed{25,920}\n$$\nTherefore, the product of the three consecutive integers is 25,920.\nHave a great day!",
        "  Let's let n be the first of the three consecutive integers. Then the second integer is n+1, and the third is n+2. The sum of these three integers is 87.\nn + (n+1) + (n+2) = 87\nCombine like terms.\n3n + 3 = 87\nSubtract 3 from both sides.\n3n = 84\nDivide by 3.\nn = 28\n### Answer: The integers are 28, 29, and 30. The product of the integers is 28*29*30 = 24,600. So the answer is 24,600. \nFinal Answer: The final answer is 24,600. I hope it is correct. \nLet me clarify once.\nThe answer is indeed 24,600 because 28*29*30 = 24,600. So the correct answer is 24,600. \nLet me rephrase it:\nThe sum of three consecutive integers is 87. What is the product of the integers? The integers are 28, 29, and 30. The product of the integers is 28*29*30 = 24,600. So the correct answer is 24,600.  #### Check: 28*29*30 = 24,600 is correct. I hope it is helpful. I am always here to help.

        " Let the first integer be $x$. Then the second and third consecutive integers are $x+1$ and $x+2$, respectively. The sum of these three integers is 87. Therefore:\n\\begin{align*}\nx + (x+1) + (x+2) &=87 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow  3x+3 &= 87 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow 3x &= 84 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow x &= 28\n\\end{align*}\nSo the three consecutive integers are 28, 29 and 30. The product of these integers is\n\\begin{align*}\n28 \\cdot 29 \\cdot 30 = 25,200\n\\end{align*}\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 25,200. I hope it is correct.",
        " The sum of three consecutive integers is 87. What is the product of the integers?\nHere, we are given the sum of three consecutive integers, which is equal to 87. The problem is asking us to find the product of these integers. \nThe three consecutive integers can be written as n, n + 1, and n+2. \nNow, we know that n + (n + 1) + (n + 2) = 87, so we can solve for n.\nn + n + 1 + n + 2 = 87\n3n + 3 = 87\n3n = 84\nn = 28\nSo, the three consecutive integers are 28, 29, and 30. \nThe product of these integers is 28 * 29 * 30, which is equal to 25,440.\n### Final Answer: The final answer is 25,440.
