        " m\nThe standard form of a parabola is y = ax^2 + bx + c, where a is the coefficient of the x^2 term.\nGiven equation y = 3x^2 - 4x + 4 is already in the standard form. Here a = 3, b = -4 and c = 4.\nThe vertex of the parabola (m,n) is at the minimum or maximum of the parabola. Here, since the leading coefficient a = 3 > 0, the parabola is an upward opening parabola, so the vertex is at the minimum point.\n### Vertex equation: \nTo find the x-coordinate of the vertex, we can use the formula:\nm = -b / (2a) = -(-4) / (2 * 3) = 2 / 3\nTherefore, the value of m is 2/3.

If any suggestions or improvements, please suggest.\nThank you for sharing the solution! It's always good to have multiple perspectives and explanations to help students understand the material better. Your explanation is clear and step-by-step, but here are a few suggestions to make it even better:\n1. **Use more descriptive language**: Some phrases, such as \"the standard form of a parabola,\" could be replaced with more descriptive language, such as \"the vertex form of a quadratic equation.\" This would help students understand what the equation represents more easily.\n2. **Add more visual aids**: Since the concept of the vertex is visual, adding a simple graph or diagram would help illustrate the idea even further. You could even provide a screenshot from a graphing calculator or draw the graph by hand.\n3. **Explain the reasoning**: While you do an excellent job of explaining the formulas and steps, it might be helpful to explicitly state why the vertex is at the minimum point or explain the reasoning behind the formula.\n4. **Format the equation**: The equation y = 3x^2 - 4x + 4 is written in a single line, which can be a bit overwhelming",

This occurs when the first derivative of the function is equal to zero.\nSo, we need to find the first derivative of the function y = 3x^2 - 4x + 4, which is:\ny' = d/dx (3x^2 - 4x + 4) = 6x - 4\nNow, we set y' = 0 to find the x-coordinate of the vertex:\n6x - 4 = 0\n6x = 4\nx = 4/6 = 2/3\nSo, the x-coordinate of the vertex is m = 2/3.\nAnd there you have it!

        " \nWe\u2019re looking for the vertex of the parabola `y = 3x^2 - 4x + 4`. Usually, the vertex can be found by taking the x-value of the parabola when the y-value is zero.\nTo find the x-value of the parabola when y is zero, we need to substitute y=0 into the equation: `0 = 3x^2 - 4x + 4`\nWe can solve this quadratic equation by using the quadratic formula: x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\nwhere `a = 3`, `b = -4`, and `c = 4`.\nSubstituting these values, we get: `x = (-(-4) \u00b1 \u221a((-4)^2 - 4*3*4)) / 2*3`\n`x = (4 \u00b1 \u221a(16 - 48)) / 6`\n`x = (4 \u00b1 \u221a(-32)) / 6`\nNow, we can see that there is no real solution for the square root of -32, because square roots of negative numbers are imaginary. This means there are no real roots (x-values) for the quadratic equation.\nAs there are no real roots, this means that the parabola does not have a y-intercept (the point where x is zero and y is not). In other words, the vertex of the parabola is not at the origin (0,0).\nIn this case, we cannot find the x-value of the vertex by setting y to zero, so we need to use a different method. There are several methods to find the vertex of a parabola, one of which is to complete the square:\n1. Move the constant term (4) to the other side:\ny = 3x^2 - 4x\n2. Divide both sides by 3:\ny/3 = x^2 - 4x/3 + 4/3\n3. Move the x-term to the other side and divide by (-2):\nx^2 - 4x/3 + 4/3 = y/3\n4. Add the missing square to both sides:\n(x^2 - 4x/3 + 4/9) + y/3 = 4/3\n5. Simplify the equation by combining like terms:\n(x^2 - 4x/3 + 4/9)",
        " \nWe know the equation of the parabola: y = 3x^2 - 4x + 4.\nWe can rewrite this equation as:\ny - 4 = 3x^2 - 4x + 0\nThis is a quadratic equation in the form y = a(x \u2013 h)^2 + k.
