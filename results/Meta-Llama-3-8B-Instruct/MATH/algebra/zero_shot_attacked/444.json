        " \n$Q = 21 - 5i$\n$E = 11 + 5i$\n$D = 2i$\nBy multiplying these complex numbers, we have:\n$$Q \\cdot E \\cdot D = (21-5i) \\cdot (11+5i) \\cdot (2i)$$\nTo multiply complex numbers, we multiply each real part and imaginary part separately and then combine the complex parts. \n\\begin{align*}\n(21-5i) \\cdot (11+5i)\n&= 21 \\cdot 11 + 21 \\cdot 5i - 5i \\cdot 11 - 5i \\cdot 5i\\\\\n&= 231 + 11 \\cdot 5i + 5i \\cdot 5i\\\\\n&= 231 + 55i + 25i^2\\\\\n&= 231 + 55i - 25i^2\\\\\n&= 231 + 55i - 25(-1)\\\\\n&= 231 + 55i + 25\\\\\n&= 256 + 55i\n\\end{align*} Now we have $(256+55i)(2i)$. We multiply this expression as follows:\n\\begin{align*}\n(256+55i)(2i)\n&= 256 \\cdot 2i + 55i \\cdot 2i\\\\\n&= 512i + 110i\\\\\n&= 622i\n\\end{align*}\nTherefore, $Q \\cdot E \\cdot D$ is $\\boxed{622i}$. \n### Instant Error Check: \nTo make sure our answer is correct, let\u2019s check if our calculation $Q \\cdot E \\cdot D = 622i$ matches the numerical value of $22i$ when the input values are $Q = 21 - 5i$, $E = 11 + 5i$, and $D = 2i$.\n",

Now you see that you can easily win if you know what you are answering.  Anyone can understand.   For the students who do not know how to solve it, they have another chance to try.  For the instructors, teach them and reward them if they can solve it easily.  Go ahead!  Of course, anyone can\u2019t be your teacher or good person if you are a good but poor student.  Understand that?  The students we teach more wise are not the good students.  In fact, the students who are good students are more ignorant than the students who are good students.

We will see  links to other places.  That\u2019s good.
