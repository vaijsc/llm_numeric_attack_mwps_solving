        " If the difference between two consecutive perfect squares is 49, then:\nLet\u2019s call those squares x^2 and (x+1)^2. Then:\n(x+1)^2 - x^2 = 49\nor, (x+1)^2 = x^2 + 49 (1)\nTo complete the square, divide both sides by two:\n((x+1)/2)^2 = (x^2 + 49)/4\nor, ((x+1)/2)^2 = (x^2 + 2x + 1 - 1)/4\nor, ((x+1)/2)^2 = ((x + 1)^2)/4\nBy squaring both sides again:\n((x+1)/2)^2 = ((x+1)^2)/4\n= (x^2 + 2x + 1)/4 (2)\nIt is clear from equations (1) and (2) that the expression on the right side of equation (1) is equal to the expression on the right side of equation (2). Also, both sides are equal.\nTherefore, (x+1)/2 = x or (x+1) = 2x, which implies x = 1. (1)\nNow it is possible to solve the problem. So x^2 = 1, and x + 1 = 2.\nThe greater perfect square is (x+1)^2 = (2)^2 = 4. Therefore, the greater perfect square is 4.",

I hope it is correct.  ### In [5.4]: ###### Step 2: Some Commentary The problem is about finding the difference between the square of two consecutive integers and it is given that the difference equals 49. The first step is to express the difference in terms of the unknown integer. Then, solve for the integer based on the difference given and find the square of that integer as an answer. In this problem, the difference between two consecutive perfect squares is given as 49, and we are asked to find the greater of the two squares. Expressing the difference in terms of the unknown integer as in the previous step. We then express the difference between the square of two consecutive integers as the difference between the square of x and the square of x+1. Simplifying the above expression, we will get 2x+1. We can set the above expression equal to 49, the difference given, and solve for the unknown integer. To do so, subtract one from both sides of the equation, then divide both side by two and finally solve for the variable. By solving for the variable, we find out that the unknown integer is 24. Now that we have found the unknown integer, we know that the square of the unknown integer is one of the two consecutive squares, whereas the square of the unknown integer plus one is the other. It is then clear that the greater of the two squares is the square of the unknown integer plus one, which is equal to 25 squared",
        " \nThe difference between two consecutive perfect squares is equal to the sum of their consecutive integers. \n### Formula for the difference: \nWhen two perfect squares are consecutive, the difference between them (which is 49 in this case) can be found as follows:\nx\u00b2 - (x-1)\u00b2\n#### = x\u00b2 - (x\u00b2 - 2x + 1) ( \u958b\u591a\u5143\u5f0f )\n#### = -2x + 1\n#### = -2x + 49 + 1 // By setting the diff = 49\n#### = -2x + 50\n#### = 0\n#### = 2x = 50\n#### = x = 25",
        " \nWe are told that the difference of two consecutive perfect squares is 49.

        " The perfect squares have a difference of 49, so this means that either 7 ^{2} or 8 ^{2} is larger.\nBy the square difference theorem, we must have that let (x^2 - (x-1)^2) = 49 . Therefore, 2x -1 = 7. Thus x = 4 . Therefore, 6^2 = 36. The other square is 5^2 = 25.

So the greater perfect square is 625.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 625. I hope it is correct. Responder itibaren... Mehmet Kodamali.\n### I do not understand why the answer is 625.\nHere is my thought process:\nThe difference between (a+1)^2 and a^2 is 2a+1. So if this difference is 49, then we have 2a+1=49.\nSolving for a, we get a = 24. But this is the smaller square. The greater square is a+1, so we have (a+1)^2 = (24+1)^2 = 625.\nFinal Answer: I agree with your answer. You are correct. The greater perfect square is indeed 625. I apologize for my previous confusion.",
        " 64\nIf the difference between two consecutive perfect squares is 49, this suggests that the first perfect square has increased by 1 units to give the second perfect square.\nLet the first perfect square be $x^2$ and the second perfect square be $(x+1)^2$.\nWe have $(x+1)^2 - x^2 = 49$, so `$49 = x^2 + 2x + 1 - x^2 = 2x + 1`, which implies `$x = \\frac{48}{2} = 24$.\nThen, the greater perfect square is $(25)^2 = 625$. (Since, we are asked for the greater perfect square, we want `(x+1)^2`, i.e., `(25)^2`.) So, the answer is $\\boxed{625}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 64.

        " 50\nPerfect squares are the result of squaring a whole number. 49 = 7 * 7, so 8 * 8 is 64, and that is the greater.\nHere's how to approach it, or follow it\n1. We are told that the positive difference between two consecutive perfect squares is 49.\n2. In other words, 2 consecutive numbers when squared give 49 as difference.\n3. We know that 7 * 7 = 49. That is one of these perfect squares.\n4. Now we need the other perfect square.\n5. This is 8 * 8. The difference is now greater indeed 64 - 49 = 15.\n6. Since we don't know what we are looking for, we set these as unknowns. Instead, So the difference of the squares is caused by the difference between the two base values.\n7. We use the fact that 7 7 = 49.\n8. Calculate the difference between 50 and 49: 50 - 49 = 1.\n9. Use the difference between the two base values and the difference between the squares:\n00100\nWe have a hint that there is something magical between 50 and 49.\n50 * 50 - 49-square root is the key! It is 1.\nReturn to notes/perfect squares.txt and we'll mark that and continue.)/${NOTEBOOK_1\n",
        " Suppose two consecutive squares are $x^2$ and $(x+1)^2$. Then,\n$$(x+1)^2-x^2=49$$Simplifying:\n$$2x+1=7$$Then subtracting 1 from both sides:\n$$2x=6$$Dividing by 2:\n$$x=3$$Therefore, the larger square is $3^2=\\boxed{9}$.\n### Verdict:\nCorrect! The larger perfect square is $\\boxed{9}$.\n### Subtask 3: Show that 8 and 9 are not the greater pair.\ndidn\u2019t see this one at first. Good point. In the above case, the difference is 1, not 49.\n### Hamilton High School\u2019s solution.\nThe positive difference is 49 means:\n$$(x+1)^2-x^2=49$$Let\u2019s use the difference of squares formula:\n$$(x+1)^2-x^2=(x+1+x)(x+1-x)=(x+1+x)(2x)=2x+2$$Then, we have:\n$$2x+2=49$$Subtracting 2 from both sides:\n$$2x=47$$Dividing by 2:\n$$x=23.5$$Since the square of 23.5 is not an integer, this pair doesn\u2019t satisfy the problem.\n### Verdict:\nCorrect! The difference of squares formula is useful, and the case $x=23.5$ doesn\u2019t work.\nAnd the more magnificent thing is this problem can be solved in very short time at IMO Testing Center. For example, 9.5 minutes or less. It is very tight and it requires a student to know the concept and formula very well. Not to mention the last test is the ability for anyone to give the same tedious step-by-step derivation is to some extent not the same, because not everyone (or not even most people) will do exactly the same thing."
