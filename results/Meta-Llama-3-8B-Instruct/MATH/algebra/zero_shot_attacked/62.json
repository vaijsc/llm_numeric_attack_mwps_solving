        " \nThe equation is $$x (x - 3) = 2$$ We know from the quadratic formula that $$x = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 - 8}}{2} = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{1}}{2} = \\frac{3 \\pm 1}{2}.$$We can write this in the required form as $$x = \\frac{3 + \\sqrt{1}}{2} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\frac{3 - \\sqrt{1}}{2} = \\frac{4}{2} \\quad\\text{or}\\quad\\frac{2}{2}.$$We see that $a = 2, b = 1, c = 2$, so $abc = \\boxed{4}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 4. I hope it is correct. You can make it apparent, however, that if $x = 1$ or $x = 2$, that $x (x - 3)$ is 2. We factor out an $x-1$ from the expression: $(x-1)(x-3) = (x-2)$ Now we see the possibilities are $\\frac{x-2}{1}$ and $\\frac{0}{1}$ I know you are a fan of information.\n### ",

        " It is probably a good idea to solve the equation $x(x-3)=2$. First consider the case when $x(x-3)=2$ has at least one real solution.  This happens if and only if $b=4$, so that the equation becomes $x^2-3x-2=0$. It is then possible to use the quadratic formula and some simplification to find that the real solutions are $\\frac{3+\\sqrt{5}}{2}$ and $\\frac{3-\\sqrt{5}}{2}$. We can now confirm that these are the solutions by noticing that their product is 2. Since we need to find $abc$, we give it a try: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{3+\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\cdot\\frac{3-\\sqrt{5}}{2}&=\\frac{9-5}{4}\\\\\n&=\\frac{4}{4}\\\\\n&=1.\n\\end{align*}If we let $a=3$, $b=5$, and $c=2$, we have that $abc=3\\cdot5\\cdot2=\\boxed{30}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 30. I hope it is correct. For another 10 points, let's consider the case that the equation $x(x-3)=2$ has no real solutions.  In this case, the discriminant is the negative square of a rational number, so it is a perfect square less than 0 (again, see (4.4) or (4.5) for a definition of the discriminant). It turns out that there is also only one other way that the discriminant can be negative, which is when it is the square of an irrational number, and can be factored as the difference of two rational squares. In the case of $x(x-3)=2$, it is relatively painless to show that the discriminant of $x^2-3x-2=0$ is $9-4\\cdot2=-5$, which is the negative square of $\\sqrt{5}$. So, when we square root the discriminant in the quadratic formula, we obtain $\\frac{3\\pm\\sqrt{-5}}{2}$. We must take the complex conjugate of this, since we know the conjugate of a complex root will also be a root of the quadratic. Thus, we have $x=\\frac{3\\pm\\",

        " We begin by writing the equation, x(x-3)=2, as follows:\n$$x(x-3)=2.$$Expanding the left-hand side, we obtain\n$$x^2-3x-2=0.$$Next, we would like to factor this quadratic equation.  We have two choices: we can either find a $2$ that divides both $x^2-3x-2$ and \u2212(x^2-3x-2) or we can solve the equation to identify a possible quadratic that has $x^2-3x-2$ as a product.  The first approach gives the following factors:\n\\begin{align*}\nx^2-3x-2&=0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad(x-2)(x+1)&=0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x-2=0\\quad\\text{or}\\quad x+1&=0\n\\end{align*}but, using our factoring criteria, we see that we can rewrite each linear factor in the following fashion: $x-2=(x-2)\\left(\\frac{x-2}{1}\\right)=\\frac{x^2-2x}{1}=\\frac{x^2-4x+2x-2}{1}=\\frac{x^2-4x+2x-4+2}{1}=x^2-4x+2$.  Furthermore, we know that, in factoring a quadratic, if we have $x+a=x+b$, the quadratic factors as \\begin{align*}x^2+b_x+2&=0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad(x+a)(x+a)&=0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x^2+ax+a^2&=0,\\end{align*}by straightforward polynomial multiplication.  Moreover, by the fundemental theorem of algebra, since we know that  a monic quadratic equation of the general form $$x^2+bx+c=0$$can be written as$$(x+a)^2=x^2+2ax+a^2,$$where $2a=b$.  Therefore, we can factor $x^2-3x-2$ as $$x^2-3x-2=(x-x+1)(x-1)$$Note that we ignored $x+1$, as that was not needed in this case.  Therefore, $x=\\boxed{2}$ or $"
