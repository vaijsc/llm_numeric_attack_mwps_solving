        " If $f(x) = 4x^3 + 2$, to find $f^{-1}(33)$, first, we need to reverse the roles of $x$ and $f(x)$.\nIn other words, we solve for $x$ in terms of $f(x)$.\nSo, $y = 4x^3 + 2$ and we want to express $x$ as a function of $y$. Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get $y-2 = 4x^3$. To get rid of $4$, we divide both sides by 4, so we obtain $\\frac{y-2}{4} = x^3$. Because $x^3$ is a positive cubic polynomial, it is invertible, since we can take the cube root of both sides.\nTherefore, $x = \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{y-2}{4}} = c(y)$. Now, to check if this is our $f^{-1}$, we substitute our expression of $x$ into the original equation $f(x) = 4x^3 + 2$.\nTo do this, plug in the expression of $x$ in terms of $y$: $f(c(y)) = 4(c(y))^3 + 2$. Expanding the right side, we have $f(c(y)) = 4c(y)^3 + 2 = y$. So, $f(c(y)) = y$. That means our expression of $x$ in terms of $y$, $x = c(y)$, is actually our $f^{-1}(y)$.\nWe want to find $f^{-1}(33)$, so plug in $y = 33$: $f^{-1}(33) = \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{33-2}{4}} = \\boxed{\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{31}{4}}} = \\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt[3]{31}}{2}}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\frac{\\sqrt[3]{31}}{2}.
