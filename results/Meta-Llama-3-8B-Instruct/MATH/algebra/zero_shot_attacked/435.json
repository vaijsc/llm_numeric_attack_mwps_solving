        " $\\sqrt[12]{9^4}=9^{\\frac{4}{12}}=(3^2)^{\\frac{4}{12}}=3^{2\\cdot\\frac{2}{6}}=\\boxed{3^{\\frac{2}{3}}}$\nExplanation: It is safe to remove the $\\sqrt[12]{\\quad}$ sign as it will not change the value of the expression. We are $\\textit{lucky}$ that the power 12 and the power 4 in the exponent are both divisible by 4, so we can rewrite the expression as 9^{\\frac{4}{12}}. Next, we notice that 9 is equal to 3^2, so we can substitute 9 with 3^2 inside the expression, giving us (3^2)^{\\frac{4}{12}}. We then apply the exponent 4 to the 2 (as well as the 3), and see that the 2 \\cdot \\frac{2}{6} simplifies to \\frac{2}{3}. Thus we have our answer of 3^{\\frac{2}{3}}.\n#### Practice Problems:\n1. $\\sqrt[3]{4^{5}}$\n2. $\\sqrt[4]{8^{3}}$\n3. $\\sqrt[6]{729^{2}}$\n4. $\\sqrt[9]{16^{2}}$\n5. $\\sqrt[12]{121^{4}}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 3^{\\frac{2}{3}}.
