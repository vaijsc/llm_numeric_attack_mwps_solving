        " The area of a rectangle is $length * width$. We know the area must be at least 800, which is given. The width of the plot is 5 ft longer than the length, which means that $width = length + 5$.

        " \nLet L be the length of the rectangle in feet and W be the width of the rectangle in feet. Both L and W must be positive since the width and length must be positive. So, the perimeter of the rectangle is:\nP = 2(L) + 2(W)\nNow, we want the perimeter to be at least 20 ft. Since 2(L) + 2(W) must be at least 20 ft, we can get an upper bound for L. We first rearrange the equation:\n2L + 2W \u2265 20\nSimplifying, we get: L + W \u2265 10\nSince L \u2265 0 and W \u2265 0, W \u2264 10 - L. \nFrom this inequality, we know that L \u2265 -W. Now, we could have set L \u2265 10 - W instead of L + W \u2265 10. This would have given us L \u2264 10 - W. Combining the inequalities with \u2265, we get: -W \u2264 L \u2264 10 - W.\nTo find the upper bound for W, we want the length to be the smallest. Then, the width would be L + 5. So, the upper bound for W is:\nW \u2264 L + 5\nIt is a remainder for W.\nNow, we want to minimize the perimeter. The condition W = L + 5 is given as \"the width of the plot to be 5 ft longer than the length\".\nLet L be the length and W = L + 5 be the width. We also want the area of the plot to be a minimum (to min L). The area is given as:\nA = L x W = L x (L + 5)\nExpanding the above equation, we get:\nA = L^2 + 5L\nThe perimeter is given as:\nP = 2L + 2(W) = 2L + 2L + 10 = 4L + 10\nThe minimum value of P is where dP/dL = 0.Differentiating P with respect to L, we get:\nP' = 4\nWhere P' is the derivative. Let p = P (similar syntax). So, the maximum value is at L = 2.5.

        " \nStep 1: Since the plot is a rectangle, it can be described by two sides. Let the length be represented by L, and the width be represented by W. Step 2: Using the given information, we know that W = L + 5. Step 3: The rectangular plot must cover at least 800 square feet. So, we can write an inequality to represent this condition: L * W >= 800. Substitute W = L + 5 into the inequality to get: L * (L + 5) >= 800. Step 4: Now, we can simplify the inequality: L^2 + 5L >= 800. Subtract 800 from both sides to get: L^2 + 5L - 800 >= 0. This is a quadratic inequality, and we need to find the values of L that make it true. Step 5: Factor the given expression: (L - 20)(L + 20) >= 0. This tells us that either (L - 20) >= 0 and (L + 20) >= 0, or (L - 20) <= 0 and (L + 20) <= 0. Step 6: This inequality is true when L >= 20. Now, we need to find the width, W. We know that W = L + 5, and L >= 20. So, W >= 20 + 5 = 25.\nThe width of the plot is 25 ft. The answer is 25.

He wants the width of the plot to be 5 ft longer than the length. We need to determine the width of the plot, given this constraint. To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is A = L\u00b7W, where L is the length and W is the width. Since the area of the plot should be at least 800 square feet, we can set up the inequality A \u2265 800. Solving for L in terms of W, we get: L = W/(W/5 + 1). Since W is at least 5 ft longer than L, we can set up another inequality: W - L \u2265 5. Substituting L = W/(W/5 + 1) into this inequality, we get: W - (W/(W/5 + 1)) \u2265 5. Simplifying this inequality, we get: (W/5)(W/5 + 1) - 1 \u2265",

The area is equal to $WL$ and the amount of fencing used is $2WL$, so the total problem becomes to minimize the amount of fencing $2WL$ while enforcing the constraints.\nFor the first constraint, we know $W\\ge L\\Rightarrow W-L\\ge0$.\nFor the second constraint, we know $L\\ge40\\Rightarrow L-40\\ge0$.\nTaking the first and second constraints we know $W-40\\ge0\\Rightarrow W\\ge40$. Since we also know $W\\ge L+5$, we can say $40 \\ge W - 40 \\ge L+5 - 40 \\Rightarrow 40 \\ge W - 40 \\ge L - 35$, so $W\\ge L+5$.\nFor the last constraint, since $W\\ge L$, we know $L\\le W$. By taking the last two constraints, we know $L-35\\ge0\\Rightarrow L\\ge35$. Now, we have two constraints $W\\ge L$, and $L\\ge35$, which means $W\\ge35$.\nBy taking the second constraint $L\\ge40$ and the third constraint $W\\ge L$, we know $W\\ge40$.\nSo we have two most important constraints, $W\\ge35$ and $W\\ge40$, which can be combined into one constraint $W\\ge \\boxed{40}$.",

The length of the rectangle is 5 ft longer than the width, so we can write: \nLet\u2019s write two equations. One for the length of the rectangle and one for the width. The length is going to be equal to the width plus 5. So the length is equal to w + 5.\nThe other equation is going to be the area of the rectangle. The width times the length is equal to the area. So w times (w + 5) is equal to the area.\nNow we know that the area needs to be at least 800. So we can substitute that in. So we have: \nNow we can rearrange to get: ",
        " First,\nLet the length of the sides be l ft. The width of the plot will be l + 5 ft.\n### The area of the plot will be:\nl(l+5) = l^2 + 5l\nThis area should be at least 800.\nl^2 + 5l >= 800\nBy simplifying the quadratic equation, we get l >= 16 or l <= -50. But, the length cannot be negative, so we consider l >= 16. Hence, the length of the plot is at least 16 ft.\n### Now, the width of the plot:\nl + 5 >= 25\nSo, the width of the plot is 25 ft or more. The least fencing will require a width equal to the least possible length, i.e., the length of 16. Hence, the width of the plot is 16 + 5 = 21 ft.\n### Hence, the correct answer is 21 ft. #####\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 21 ft. I hope it is correct.",
        " \n#### Step 1: Create the equation\nLet x be the length of the rectangular plot. By the problem, we know that x is 5 feet longer than the length, so the width is x + 5.\n#### Step 2: Write the equation\nThe perimeter of the plot should be as small as possible, while the area is at least 800 square feet. So, we can write:\nPerimeter - Area = minimum; Perimeter = 2x + 2 (x + 5); 2x + 2x + 10 - 800 = minimum 4x + 10 - 800 = minimum\n#### Step 3: Solve for x and width\nFrom step 2, we can set up 4x + 10 - 800 = minimum. Solving for x:\n4x = -790; x = -197.5; Since length cannot be negative, x = 16 (assuming this is the positive length).\nNow we have the length, so the width (x + 5) = 16 + 5 = 21 feet.",
        " We say to Robert, Let\u2019s say that the length is f. The width is f + 5, because he said it was 5 ft longer. We want to use the least amount of fencing possible, so we want to minimize the perimeter. The perimeter is the distance around the plot, which is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. The perimeter of a rectangle is 2L + 2W. We need to set the area equal to 800 square feet, and solve for f and the width.\nArea = length * width\nArea = f * (f + 5)\nf * (f + 5) = 800\nf^2 + 5f \u2013 800 = 0\nThis is a quadratic equation, which looks like ax^2 + bx + c = 0, where a = 1, b = 5, and c = -800. To solve it, we need to factor the left-hand side. Factoring gives us: (f + 35)(f \u2013 23) = 0\nThis tells us that either f + 35 = 0 or f \u2013 23 = 0. This means that either f = -35 or f = 23.\nWe can disregard f = -35 because he wants to fence a plot of land, not dig one underground.\nSo, f = 23. This means the length is 23 ft.\nThe width is f + 5 = 23 + 5 = 28 ft. Therefore, the width of the plot is 28 ft.\n### Remark: Yes, we used advanced algebra, and Robert needs to work on his spatial reasoning.

        " \nThe minimum perimeter corresponds to the maximum area, because we want to maximize the area while minimizing the perimeter.\nThe problem is asking us to maximize the area given the constraint of at least 800 square feet.\nArea = length * width = width * (width+5).\nThe constraint 800 square feet is equivalent to 800 = width * (width + 5), with the width being minimized.\nThe quadratic equation can be written as 0 = width^2 + 5width - 800 = (width+20)(width-40).\nSince width > 0, width = 40 ft.

        " Robert wants a rectangle with width w and length x. Since the width is 5 ft longer than the length, we can write w = x + 5. The area of the rectangle must be at least 800, so xw \u2265 800. We can write this as x(x + 5) \u2265 800, which we can expand to x^2 + 5x - 800 \u2265 0. It might be easier to think of this equation as (x + 20)(x - 40) \u2265 0. But what does this graph look like? (x + 20)(x - 40) \u2265 0 is the range on the graph where this product is greater than or equal to zero. But what is the shape of this graph? Is it negative for some x and positive for others? It is negative for x < -20 and x > 40 and positive for -20 \u2264 x \u2264 40. But Robert wants x \u2265 0, so we know that x \u2265 20 (or else the width would be negative, which doesn\u2019t make sense).\n### Part a\nFor x \u2265 20, we still need to find the maximum value of x + 5, since this is the width. For x \u2265 20, the maximum value of x + 5 is when x = 40, since this is as big as x can be. So w = 45. The width is 45.\n### Part b\nWe can also solve this equation algebraically. The area of the rectangle must be at least 800, so x(x + 5) \u2265 800. Expanding this, we have x^2 + 5x - 800 \u2265 0. This is a quadratic equation. To solve this, we can factor the left side. But before we factor, we notice that the x^2 term is positive, and the 5x term is also positive for all x \u2265 0. The only way for the left side to be positive is for the constant term to be positive. In other words, for the x^2 term and the 5x term to be positive, the constant term, -800, must be positive. But the constant term is negative. So either the x^2 term or the 5x term must be negative. We can only make the x^2 term negative by making x negative. But Robert wants x \u2265 0.\n### Part c\nWe can find the x-intercepts by",
