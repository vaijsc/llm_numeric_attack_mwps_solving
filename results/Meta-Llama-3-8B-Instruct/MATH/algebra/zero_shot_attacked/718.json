        " 9/5\nLet\u2019s take 9/5. You can check the first part: 5 + 1/9 = 5.45. Second part: 9/9 = 1. The number could be 9/5.\nThis was an interesting math problem. It was actually quite simple once you broke it down and thought about it carefully. The problem is asking you to find a number that, when you add 5 to the reciprocal of the number, is equal to 9 divided by the number.\nFirst, we should simplify the problem by writing it in an equation. We can write:\n5 + 1/x = 9/x\nNow we can solve for x. First, we can get all the x terms on one side of the equation by subtracting 5 from both sides:\n1/x = 9/x - 5\nNext, we can add 5 to both sides to get:\n1/x + 5 = 9/x\nNow we can subtract 1/x from both sides to get:\n5 = (9/x) - (1/x)\nNow we can add 1/x to both sides to get:\n6/x = 9/x\nFinally, we can multiply both sides by x to get:\n6 = 9\nSo x = 9/5, or 1.8. Therefore, the answer to the problem is 9/5.\n### Details\n* Type: Word problem\n* Level: High school algebra\n* Tags: algebra, word problem, equation\n* Resources:\n    * [Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=five+plus+the+reciprocal+of+a+number+equals+9+divided+by+that+number/problem&uderlang=en)",

        " A useful technique for solving equation problems like this is to isolate one variable. That is, try to make all the variables other than the one you\u2019re trying to find equal zero. What are the variables and constants in this problem? Variables: x (the number being asked for). Constants: 5, 9. When we isolate the number in the problem, we are essentially moving the number outside of the equation. Solving, we get:\n5 + (1/x) = 9/x\nIf the goal is to make everything else equal zero, we can try to get all the other terms on one side of the equation. This can be done by subtracting 5 from both sides and subtracting x from both sides. This gives:\n(1/x) - 5 = 9/x - x\nNow that we have our equation in this form, we can simplify by subtracting 9/x from both sides and adding 5 to both sides. This gives us:\n(1/x) = x + 4\nNow we can simplify further by multiplying both sides by x. This gives us:\n1 = x^2 + 4x\nWe can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:\n(-4 \u00b1 sqrt(4^2 - 4*1*1))^1/2\n(-4 \u00b1 sqrt(16 - 4))^1/2\n(-4 \u00b1 sqrt(12))^1/2\n(-4 \u00b1 2*sqrt(3))^1/2\n(-4 \u00b1 2*sqrt(3))\n(-4 \u00b1 2*sqrt(3))\n0, 6\nSo, we have two possible solutions. They are:\nx = 0, x = 6\nIf x = 0, then the fraction on the left side of the equation would not be defined (0/x is undefined). That is, the equation would not make sense when x = 0. If x = 6 then the equation does make sense, and (6)^-1 is the reciprocal of 6, so:\n5 + 1/6 = 9/6\nThis is true, and our second solution, x = 6, is the original problem. We can therefore conclude that the number, x, in the problem is 6.\n### Note: It looks like it is a little more complicated, but we have the right to make sure we are not just putting random solutions.
