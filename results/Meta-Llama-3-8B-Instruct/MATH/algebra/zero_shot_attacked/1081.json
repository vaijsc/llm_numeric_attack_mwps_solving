        " We have to find the difference between the correct meeting point and the meeting point where you agreed. To find the meeting point, we can take the average of the given points and locate it on y=x/v, which is the line through the origin (0,0) with slope 1, where v is the vertical difference between the y-coordinates and is the horizontal difference between the x-coordinates.

        " \nAnnie is located at (4,5)\nBarbara says she is located at (-6,2) but actually is at (-10,4) so she is 4 units away from her actual position, in the x-direction.\n### Example:\nLet\u2019s consider her actual position (-10,4). We can find the x-difference between the actual position and her reported position, which is 6 units.\n4 - (-10) = 6\nSo, the positive difference in the x-coordinates (where Annie and Barbara agreed to meet) is 6. Annie agreed to meet Barbara at (-6,2) in the x-direction, which is (4 - (-6)) = 10 units away, or 10 - 6 = 4 units away, which is in the opposite direction. Since Annie agreed to meet Barbara in x-direction, this distance should be positive.\nSo, the positive difference in the x-coordinates of where Annie and Barbara agreed to meet and where they should actually meet is 6 units. If you are not sure about this answer, consider drawing a diagram of the sides of the right triangle formed by Annie\u2019s position, Barbara\u2019s actual position, and the distance between them.  The triangle\u2019s long side is 10 units, and the base is 6 units.

        " Let's calculate Annie's distance, then calculate Barbara's distance, then see where they meet.\nAnnie is at (4,5) and we want to know where she should be. Barbara is saying she is at (-6,2), but Barbara is actually at (-10,4). \n#### Annie's distance:\nIf the x-coordinates are of Annie and Barbara agreed to meet and where they should actually meet, the coordinates are the same for Annie since she is correct. So the x coordinates of where Annie and Barbara agreed to meet are the same as Annie\u2019s coordinates which are 4. Barbara said she was at (-6,2) but actually was at (-10,4), so Barbara's agreed meeting point is the same as Barbara's original coordinates which are -6. The agreed meeting point for Annie and Barbara is at (4,-6). \n#### Barbara's distance:\nBarbara actually is at (-10,4). We need Barbara's actual agreed meeting point which is her actual position. So Barbara's agreed meeting point is also (-10,4).\n#### Meeting point:\nAnnie suggested the meeting place as (4,-6) and Barbara guessed it incorrectly as (4,-6) too. Annie and Barbara actually meet at (4,4). \n#### Positive difference:\nwe need the difference in the x-coordinates of where Annie and Barbara agreed to meet and where they should actually meet if Annie is located at (4,5) and Barbara says she is located at (-6,2), but she actually is at (-10,4). The x-coordinates are 4 for the agreed meeting point and actual meeting point of Annie. \nThe x-coordinates for Barbara at the agreed meeting point is -6, and at the actual meeting point is -10. So the difference in the x-coordinates is |6-10| = 4.\n#### Final answer:\nThe positive difference in the x-coordinates of where Annie and Barbara agreed to meet and where they should actually meet is 4.

        " \nStep 1: Determine the coordinates where Annie and Barbara agreed to meet. Since Annie is at (4,5) and Barbara wants to meet with her, we can find the coordinate for meeting by averaging the coordinates for both Annie and Barbara. In other words, we will find the average of the x-coordinates of both Annie and Barbara.\nx-coordinate for Annie: 4\nx-coordinate for Barbara (according to Barbara): -6\nAverage x-coordinate for meeting: (4 + (-6)) / 2 = -1\nSo, the x-coordinate for where Annie and Barbara agreed to meet is -1.\nStep 2: Determine the coordinates where they should actually meet. Since Barbara is actually located at (-10,4), we need to average the coordinates with Annie who is at (4,5).\nx-coordinate for Annie: 4\nx-coordinate for Barbara (actual): -10\nAverage x-coordinate for actual meeting: (4 + (-10)) / 2 = -3\nSo, the x-coordinate for where they should actually meet is -3.\nStep 3: Determine the positive difference in the x-coordinates. We need to subtract the x-coordinate where they agreed to meet from the x-coordinate where they should actually meet.\nPositive difference: -3 (-x-coordinate for where they should actually meet) - (-1) (x-coordinate where they agreed to meet) = 2\nTherefore, the positive difference in the x-coordinates is 2. Barbara should travel 2 units in the positive direction to reach the correct meeting spot.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2. I hope it is correct.",

",
        " \nThe key is to find the difference in the x-coordinates where they agreed to meet and where they should actually meet.\nFirst, let\u2019s find the x-coordinate where Annie and Barbara agree to meet. We are given that Barbara is located at (-6,2), so her actual x-coordinate is -6. Annie is located at (4,5), so it is possible to calculate where they agree to meet.\nAnnie\u2019s x-coordinate is 4. Barbara\u2019s x-coordinate is -6. To find where they agree to meet, we add the x-coordinates of Annie and Barbara. So, we get:\n-6 + 4 = -2\nSo, they agree to meet at an x-coordinate of -2.\nSecond, let\u2019s find the x-coordinate where they should actually meet. Barbara actually is at (-10,4), so her actual x-coordinate is -10. Annie\u2019s x-coordinate is 4. To find where they should actually meet, we add the x-coordinates of Annie and Barbara.

Let the actual position of Barbara be (-10,4).      The correct coordinate for the meeting point is halfway between Annie and Barbara. We can find the shared x-coordinate using the midpoint formula: \\frac{(b)+4}{2}=x   where we solve for x. If we solve for b, we get b = 2x - 4\nNow, using the midpoint formula for the y-coordinate:     \\frac{5+4}{2} = y    which equals 4.5.     So the actual meeting point is (x, 4.5). Solving for x in the previous equation, we have x = 1, which we substitute into the equation to find the correct x-coordinate. The difference in coordinates is the distance (2) from the incorrect meeting point (which is halfway between the incorrect position of Barbara and Annie) and the correct meeting point. This distance is 9 units.\nTherefore, the answer is 9. So, Annie and Barbara agreed to meet at (-8,4.5) but they should actually meet at (1,4.5).

        "  First, let\u2019s determine the correct location of Barbara. She says she is at (-6,2), but she is actually at (-10,4). So, the correct location of Barbara is (-10,4).\nNow, let\u2019s consider the initial positions of both Annie and Barbara.\nAnnie is located at (4,5).\nBarbara is at (-10,4), which is the correct location.\nTo find the correct meeting point, you can use the midpoint formula. Since the two points have equal importance in choosing the meeting point, you can take the average of the x-coordinates and the average of the y-coordinates.\nFor the calculation of the x-coordinates, you need to find the midpoint of the x-coordinates.\n(4+(-10))/2 = (-6)/2 = -3\nSo, the average x-coordinate (or x-coordinate of the meeting point) is -3.\nNow, do the same thing for the y-coordinates:\n(5+4)/2 = (9)/2 = 4.5\nSo, the average y-coordinate (or y-coordinate of the meeting point) is 4.5.\nTherefore, the x-coordinates of the agreed-upon meeting point and the correct meeting point are -3 and -3 (no change in the x-coordinate), and the y-coordinates are 5 and 4.5. To find the positive difference in the x-coordinates, you can subtract the agreed-upon meeting point\u2019s x-coordinate from the correct meeting point\u2019s x-coordinate:\n4 - (-3) = 7\nSo, the positive difference in the x-coordinates is 7.",
        " 21\nLet's find the location where they should actually meet. Barbara is located at (-10, 4), so she should meet Annie at some point on the line that passes through both of them and has a slope perpendicular to the line through the 2 given positions.\nThe slope of the line through Annie is given by the formula \\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1} = \\frac{5-5}{4-0} = 0. Since perpendicular lines have slopes that are negative reciprocals of each other, the slope of the line through Barbara is -\\frac{1}{0} = undefined. This line is vertical!\nThe line is vertical, so it only has x-coordinates. If the point Barbara should meet Annie has a y-coordinate of y = 4, then it has an x-coordinate of x = 4.\nAnnie is located at (4,5), so she should meet Barbara at point (4,4). That\u2019s the location where they should actually meet.\nThat means, where they agreed to meet is either the same point or point (4,5) which is the point where Annie is. For me, both points where they agreed to meet and actually meet is the same. So, the positive difference in the x-coordinates is 0 which is incorrect. Since both points is same, there must be another possible point where they agreed to meet, which is z = (z,_).\nLooking at the point where Barbara should actually meet Annie, you can see that the x-coordinate is 4. Now, find the point where Annie and Barbara can meet which has the same x-coordinate of 4. This is the point Annie can meet Barbara which is (4,2).\nSo, positive difference in the x-coordinates of where Annie and Barbara agreed to meet and where they should actually meet if Annie is located at (4,5) and Barbara says she is located at (-6,2), but she actually is at (-10,4) is 4-(-6) = 10.\nThe positive difference in the x-coordinates of where Annie and Barbara agreed to meet and where they should actually meet if Annie is located at (4,5) and Barbara says she is located at (-6,2), but she actually is at (-10,4) is 10. So, the correct answer is 10. It is also possible that you can obtain different answer through pencil drawings of the lines and points.",
        "  The difference is the distance. For this problem, we will need to find the coordinates of where Annie and Barbara agreed and where they should actually agree.\nLet's start with where Annie is located. She is located at (4,5).\nBarbara says she is located at (-6,2) but she actually is at (-10,4).\nSo first we need to find the coordinates for where Annie and Barbara agreed to meet.\nWe know Barbara says she is located at (-6,2) so she is at the point (-6,2).\nWe also know that they agree to meet so their x-coordinates need to be the same.\nAnnie is at (4,5) and they agree on an x-coordinate so Annie will move to (-6,5).\nThat's where they agree to meet.\nNow we need to find the difference in the x-coordinates.\nThe actual x-coordinate for Barbara is -10 and the x-coordinate where they agree is -6.\nSo we subtract -6 from -10 to find the difference. -10 - (-6) = -10 + 6 = -4\nSo the difference in the x-coordinates is -4.\nThe positive difference is | -4| = 4. So the answer is 4.",
        " To find the positive difference, we must determine the meeting point for both Annie and Barbara. We can then calculate the absolute difference.\n### Calculation:\nThe agreed meeting point is the midpoint of Annie and Barbara\u2019s actual locations. Annie is at (4,5) while her actual location is (5,6). This means the agreed meeting point = midpoint (3.5, 5.5)\nNow, Barbara\u2019s agreed location is (-6,2) but her actual location is (-10,4). So, the actual meeting point = midpoint (-8,3)\nThe difference between the two meeting points is the difference between (-8,3) and (3.5,5.5). The positive difference is the distance between the x-coordinates.\n### Positive difference in x-coordinates = |3.5 + 8| = |11.5| = 11.5\n### Conclusion:\nThe positive difference in the x-coordinates where Annie and Barbara agreed to meet and where they should actually meet is 11.5.",
        " \nWe have to find the positive difference in the x-coordinates, so the key idea here is the concept of absolute values in math operations.\nStep1:\nFind the x-coordinates where Annie and Barbara agreed to meet. This implies that we have to find the x-coordinate where both agree.\nStep2:\nGet the x-coordinates of Annie, Barbara, and the agreed meeting point.\nStep3:\nNow, we find the x-coordinate of Barbara. However, we know that Barbara has lied. So, she is actually located at (-10,4).\nStep4:\nTo find the x-agreed point, find the x-coordinate of Annie (4) and Barbara's (told, which is -6).\nStep5:\nNow, find the positive difference between these two points. Here, we apply an important concept from math operations called absolute values.\nHere's the step-by-step calculation:\n(-6) - 4 = -10\nSo, the agreed x-coordinate is -6 and the actual is -10.\nFinal calculation:\n10 - |10| = 10 - 10 = 0\nHowever, the problem requests the positive difference.\nTo find the positive difference, add a positive absolute value:\n|0| = 0\nNow, we combine this step with the previous step:\n|-10| = 10\n10 - |0| = 0\nNow, we have the x-coordinates, and we'll do the same calculation for the y-coordinates.\nSo, the heart of this question remains the x-agreed challenge. Therefore:\nThe required positive difference = |(-6) - 4| = |10| = 10\nThe answer is 10. ClassroomLegend 05:34, 13 April 2012 (UTC) and User:RayPaw 11:34, 1 February 2016 (UTC)",

        " Step 1\nAnnie (4,5) tells Annie to meet Barbara at Barbara\u2019s reported coordinates, which is -6,2). So, we draw a straight line passing through (4,5) and (-6,2). Step 2\nTo find the equation of the straight line, we can use the slope formula. M = ( y1 - y2 ) / ( x1 - x2) where (x1, y1) is (4,5) and (x2, y2) is (-6,2). M = (5 - 2) / (4 - (-6))\nM = 3 / 10\nSo, the slope is 3/10.\n#### Write the equation in the slope-intercept form y = mx + b where m = 3/10 and (4,5) lies on the line.\n#### slope-intercept form\ny = 3/10 x + b\nPlug in 4 and 5: 5 = 3/10 * 4 + b\nSolve for b: b = 2\n#### Write the equation in the slope-intercept form\ny = (3/10) x + 2\n#### Barbara is actually at (-10,4) Instead of (-6,2). We need to update the y-coordinate.\n#### New equation\ny = (3/10) x + 2\n4 = (3/10) * (-10) + 2\n4 = -3 + 2\n4 = -1\nThis cannot happen.
