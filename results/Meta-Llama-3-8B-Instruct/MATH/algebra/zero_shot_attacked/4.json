        " x = 16\n4^8 means we have 8 factors of 4. And we know that 4 = 2^2. So, the equation 4^8 = 2^x is actually the same as (2^2)^8 = 2^x. If we expand the left side of the equation, we get: 2^16 = 2^x\nFrom here, we can easily see that x = 16. We have that 2^16 is the same as the right side of the equation.\nThis instruction or response is realized by the practical application of the properties and laws of exponentiation such as the rule that a^(m) \\* a^(n) = a^(m+n) and (a^m)^n = a^(m*n) and a^(m) = (b^(m))^. Since 4 = 2^2, we can express 4^8 as (2^2)^8 = 2^(2*8) = 2^16. This helps us to simplify the equation 4^8 = 2^x to 2^16 = 2^x and thats solving our equation for x.
