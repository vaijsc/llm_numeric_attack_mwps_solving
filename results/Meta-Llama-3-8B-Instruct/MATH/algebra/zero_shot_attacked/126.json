I hope it is correct. ### Expert Solution Let's find the value of 24-(2x-y) if x=4 and y=9. First, let's find the value of 2x: 2*4 = 8. Then, let's find the value of 2x-y: 8-9 = -1. Finally, let's find the value of 24-(2x-y): 24-(-1) = 24+1 = 25. Since the problem asks for the difference, we subtract 4 from the resulting value of 25. So, the result is 25-5 = -5. Therefore, the value of 24-(2x-y) if x=4 and y=9 is -5. Have a great day! Final Answer: The final answer is -5. I hope it is correct. ### Check Solutions You can check your solutions by entering $x=4$ and $y=9$ into your calculator to evaluate the expression $24-(2x-y)$. When you do this, you should get a value of -5, which confirms that your solution is correct. Tags: ### Recently Answered ",
        " 24-(2x-y)\nWe are given that $x = 4$ and $y = 9$.\n### Final Answer: The final answer is 24 - (2 \\cdot 4 - 9) = 24 - 2 = 22. I hope it is correct. ### 24-(2x-y) Let's think step by step. We are given that $x = 4$ and $y = 9$. Now, we have to substitute these values into the expression. So, we replace $x$ with 4 and $y$ with 9, in the expression $(2x-y)$. The reason why we don't replace with 4 and 9 directly is that we don't know if it is required to be that way or not. So, we do this. So, we have, $(2x-y) = (2\\cdot 4 - 9)$ Now, let's evaluate this. First, let's do the multiplication of 2 and 4. We have, $\\begin{array}{l} 2 \\times 4 = 8 \\end{array}$ So, now we have $(2x-y) = (8 - 9)$ Now, let's evaluate this expression. We have, $\\begin{array}{l} 8 - 9 = - 1 \\end{array}$ So, now we have, $\\begin{array}{l} 2x-y = - 1 \\end{array}$ Now, we have to subtract this from 24. So, now we have, $\\boxed{24-(2x-y) = 24 - (- 1) = 25}$ So, the final answer is 25. Final Answer: The final answer is 25. I hope it is correct.  24-(2x-y) Let's think step by step. We are given that $x = 4$ and $y = 9$. Now, we have to substitute these values into the expression. So, we replace $x$ with 4 and $y$ with 9, in the expression $(2x-y)$. The reason why we don't replace with 4 and 9 directly is that we don't know if it is required to be that way or not. So, we do this. So, we have, $(2x-y) = (2\\cdot 4 - 9)$ Now, let's evaluate this.

        " 24-(2(4)-9) First, simplify the expression $24-(2(4)-9)$. We simplify the expression $2(4)$ into $8$. Thus, $24-(2(4)-9)=24-(8-9)$. Next, simplify the expression $8-9$ into $-1$. So, $24-(2(4)-9)=24-(-1)$. Thus, $24-(2(4)-9)=\\boxed{25}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 25. I hope it is correct. ### Context: This is an exercise in explicit evaluation of algebraic expressions. The student must recognize how to simplify the expression using the order of operations, and then evaluate the simplified expression with given values for $x$ and $y$. The goal is to demonstrate a clear and logical understanding of how to evaluate algebraic expressions. ### Standard: The student is expected to be able to evaluate algebraic expressions with given values for variables, following the order of operations (PEMDAS). This is considered a fundamental skill for working with algebraic expressions. The student must demonstrate a clear understanding of basic algebraic operations, including addition and subtraction, multiplication and division, and exponentiation. Additionally, the student must be able to simplify expressions according to the order of operations, and then evaluate the simplified expression with given values for variables. The student's solution should be clear, logical, and accurate. ### Level: Grade 9-10, Level 1-2 Math is typically the level where students are introduced to algebraic expressions and equations. Evaluating expressions is an essential skill for working with algebra, and students are expected to develop this skill in this level. The task requires a basic understanding of algebraic operations and the order of operations, as well as the ability to simplify expressions and evaluate them with given values. At this level, students are building foundational skills for more advanced math concepts in higher grades. Evaluating algebraic expressions with given values is a critical skill for success in later math courses, and it is essential for students to develop this skill with precision and accuracy.addClass='alg-eval-grade9' setTimeout(function() { MathJax yielded no output for \\require{cancel} }Assets Not Found Illustration: Cancellation to solve for a variableImageUrl: https://americaed.org/assets/education/resources/illustrations/4BB93F29-6B4F-4BF5-A0BD-3FF02A105881",
