        " Recall that the cost is proportional to the area of the floor.  Letting $x$ be the area (in square feet) and $y$ be the cost (in$\\$$), we can set up the equation \\begin{align*}\ny&=kx\\\\\n&\\Rightarrow\\quad k=\\frac yx.\n\\end{align*}We have that $y=805$ when $x=70$. Thus, $k=\\frac{805}{70}$. For $x=208$, $\\begin{align*}\ny&=kx\\\\\n&=k(208)\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{805}{70}\\right)(208)\\\\\n&=\\boxed{232}\n\\end{align*}$ Final Answer: The final answer is 232. I hope it is correct.  The cost to carpet a floor is directly proportional to the area.  It costs $\\$$805 to carpet a floor that is $14\\times 5$ square feet.  How much will it cost to carpet a floor that is $16\\times 13$ square feet?\nLet\u2019s think step by step.",
        " We can first find a proportionality constant $k$ from the information given:\n \\begin{align*}\n k\\cdot 14\\cdot5&=\\$\\$805\\Leftrightarrow k=57.75.\n\\end{align*}\nTo find the cost of carpeting the $16\\times13$ square feet floor, we multiply this constant by the area: \\begin{align*}\n \\text{Cost}&=k\\cdot16\\cdot13= k(208)\\\\\n &=57.75\\cdot208=\\boxed{\\$12006}.\n \\end{align*} Final Answer: The final answer is$\\$12006$. I hope it is correct.  Recall the definition of proportionality: For non-negative values $x_1$ and $x_2$ and non-zero values $y_1$ and $y_2$, we say that $y_1$ varies directly proportional to $x_1$ if there is some constant $k$ such that $y_1= kx_1$. In other words, there is some constant $k$ such that $y_1$ depends on $x_1$ and $y_2$ depends on $x_2$ in such a way that their ratios are equal. So we have \\begin{align*} \\frac{\\text{Cost 1}}{14\\cdot5} &=\\frac{\\text{Cost 2}}{16\\cdot13}\\\\ \\Rightarrow 805&=\\frac{k\\cdot16\\cdot13}{14\\cdot5}\\\\ &=\\frac{km}{7} \\end{align*} where $m=208$.  Therefore, we have $\\frac{805}{208}=\\frac{57.75}{7}$, from here you can easily find that $k=57.75$.  Now it is a matter of multiplication to find the final answer: $\\$12006$. Final Answer: The final answer is$\\$12006$. I hope it is correct.  It is simple.  A constant proportionality coefficient (multiplication constant) can be found by dividing the known cost by the known area. Then multiply this coefficient by the new area to get the new cost. Mind that I ignore units and focus on the numbers.\n### Better explanation\nIf we think of the given cost and area as variables and consider them to be part of an equation, we can come up with the idea of the proportionality coefficient. We know that",
        " $805 is proportional to 14*5=70 square feet. Thus, it is proportional to 0.011429 times the square footage. Let\u2019s use x to be the new square footage. The new carpeting cost would be 0.011429\\times x =805. We can also solve for x to get x = 70 / 0.011429 = 6120. Change the denominator into the same form to get 70 \\times 100 / 0.111429 = 6120. And give it a green check.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 805\\times16/14/5= \\boxed{114.29}. I hope it is correct.  ### Solution2:  The cost to carpet a floor is directly proportional to the area.  If it takes $805 to carpet a floor that is $14\\times 5 = 70$ square feet, then the cost per square foot is $805/70 = 11.57$.  The floor that we want to carpet is $16\\times 13 = 208$ square feet.  The cost to carpet it will be $11.57\\times 208 = \\boxed{2407.76}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2407.76. I hope it is correct.                          ",

        " To find the cost per square foot, we will find out how much it costs to carpet $\\,$$1 square feet. Notice that$\\,$$805=\\$85\\times 9.5=\\$14\\times 5\\times 9.5$, and so if we let $c$ be the cost per square foot, then we have $c\\cdot9.5=\\$805$. From this, we obtain that $c=\\frac{\\$805}{9.5}$.  Since 9.5 seems like an annoying decimal, let's simplify: \\begin{align*} \\frac{\\$805}{9.5}&=\\frac{\\$5\\times 805}{5\\times9.5}\\\\\\\\ &=\\frac{\\$5\\times 169}{5\\times1.9}\\\\ &=\\frac{\\$169}{1.9}\\\\\\\\ &=\\frac{\\$29\\times7}{29\\times0.065}))\\\\\\\\ &\\approx \\$29\\times 107.69\\approx \\$29.65\\$.

Can we show that the cost to carpet a floor is directly proportional to the area? Suppose the cost of carpeting a floor with an area of is, and suppose we are told that the cost of carpeting a floor with area is. We are assuming that the cost of carpeting a floor with an area ofis, and we are told that the cost of carpeting a floor with area is. Now we have a fixed ratio between the cost of the floor and the area. To show this, note that, because the cost is equal to the 805 floor and we have 14 and 5, the cost per square foot should equal 805 divided by the 5 times 14, which is 29, so because the 29 is a constant, we have a direct ratio between the cost and the area, it means that it is directly proportional.
