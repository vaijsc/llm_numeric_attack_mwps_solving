You got the problem right. Now let\u2019s think about why we got this answer. We were told \\begin{align*} f(x) = \\sqrt{3x} + 2, \\end{align*} so when we put in $x = 0,$ we have \\begin{align*} f(0) = \\sqrt{3\\cdot0} + 2 = 0 + 2 = 2. \\end{align*} This makes sense because when you put in zero for $x,$ you essentially are saying there is nothing to multiply $3$ by to get a square root.  You just add two.  When you do this, you get $2$.\nWhen you put in $x = 3,$ you get \\begin{align*} f(3) = \\sqrt{3\\cdot3} + 2 = \\sqrt{9} + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5. \\end{align*} This makes sense because when you put in $3$ for $x,$ you are essentially saying there\u2019s something there to multiply $3$ by to get a square root.

        " Hey, I think I know this one!\nWe need to find the value of $f(0) + f(3)$. We know that $f(x) = \\sqrt{3x} + 2$, so we can plug in $0$ and $3$ into $f(x)$ to get $f(0) = \\sqrt{3(0)} + 2 = 2$, and $f(3) = \\sqrt{3(3)} + 2 = \\sqrt{9} + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5$.

        " Let\u2019s take $f(x)=\\sqrt{3x}+2$. We need to find out $f(0) + f(3)$. Since we consider $x$ as input to $f$, we need to plug in 0 and 3 to the function $f$ and plug them into the function, like a calculator. To begin with, we can simply evaluate the values of $0$ in the expression:\n$f(0)=\\sqrt{0\\cdot3}+2=\\sqrt{0}+2$\nSince we know that $\\sqrt{0}=0$ (or using the definition of a square root), the value of the expression becomes $0 + 2 = 2$.\nNext, in the 3:\n$f(3)=\\sqrt{3\\cdot3}+2$\nWe can produce the answer by evaluating the expression sqrt(9)+2, so the answer is 5.\nNow, we simply combine both with the earlier results:\n$f(0)+f(3)=2+5$\nWe have a simple addition here, for 7. So the final outcome is 7.\n### Final Answer: The final answer is 7. I hope it is correct.\u0941\u0902undry of love.\u2019 That was it. Thanks for checking it out, and I have a little more to help you now. And it is like trying to climb a mountain. We want to move up and be happy, safe, and strong. But there are obstacles like challenges, and the truth is that trauma can really limit our potential. From my research, this is what I wanted to tell you. The truth about trauma is that it is a very heavy burden. It is difficult to get rid of when we are not aware of it, and it can affect us in real and profound ways. It can make us feel scared, anxious, and numb. It can make us feel like we cannot do things we used to do. And the more we avoid it, the more it can overwhelm us. I want to say it is important to know and face it. We are strong and capable of changing our story. Now I\u2019ve found these steps that can help us overcome it and live a better life.\nHope you enjoyed it!\nIt was always fascinating to give a unique, exclusive, and loving relationship. Life is precious, and I wish for you to understand that it was really, really important.\nAs always, with all the energy, light, and love to the world.\nAnd with these",
