        " The degree of the polynomial $f(x)$ is 4, and the degree of the polynomial $g(x)$ is 6. That means when we multiply the polynomial $f(x)$ with 3 we are only increasing the degree by 1.

We can calculate it as follows:\n\\begin{align*}\n3f(x) &= 3x^4\\\\\n2g(x) &= 2x^6\n\\end{align*}\nAdding them together, we get:\n\\begin{align*}\n3f(x) + 2g(x) &= 3x^4 + 2x^6\n\\end{align*}\nThe degree of this polynomial is 6, which is the maximum of the degree of $f(x)$ (which is 4) and the degree of $g(x)$ (which is 6). So, the degree of $3f(x) + 2g(x)$ is indeed 6. And this is true in general, if $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $n$, and $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $m$, then the degree of $3f(x) + 2g(x)$ is $max(n,m)$.

Introduction to polynomial equations: A polynomial is an expression consisting of variables (or indeterminates) and coefficients combined using only addition, subtraction, and multiplication with the variables being raised to nonnegative integer powers. For example, $x$ and $x^{2} + x^{3}$ are polynomials. Polynomial equations are defined as equations in which the highest power of the variable(s) is equal to the degree of the polynomial. For example, $x^{2} + 2x - 5 = 0$ is a polynomial equation. $\\degree$ of a polynomial is defined as the highest power of a variable in the polynomial. For example, the degree of the polynomial $x^{3} + 2x^{2} - 3x - 1$ is 3. $\\degree$ of a polynomial is used to determine the number of real roots for the polynomial equation. In general, a polynomial equation of degree $n$ can have $n$ real roots. A polynomial equation of degree $0$ or $1$ can have at most one real root. $\\degree$ of a polynomial is also used to determine where the polynomial is equal to zero. For example, a polynomial equation of degree $2$ can have at most two real roots. $\\degree$ of a polynomial is also used to determine",
        " The degree of the polynomial is the highest power of the variable. 3 is a constant, so the highest power in $3f(x)$ is the highest power in $f(x)$. For this polynomial, we know that the degree is 4. $2g(x)$ has a highest power of 6 from $g(x)$. Since 3 and 2 are constants, we just take the highest power between 4 and 6, which is 6. The degree of $3f(x)+2g(x)$ is $\\boxed{6}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 6. I hope it is correct. 3f(x)+2g(x)= Values of f(x) and g(x) are shift by any number due to the multiplication value of f(x) with 3 and g(x) with 2 in the equation, it can be maximally calculated. Therefore, the polynomial produced by the equation 3f(x)+2g(x) is a 6th degree polynomial. The degree, first quartile (afterm'll be 3f(x)< After judi), We must be fourth in the case of f (x) Case. Due to this reason, it is second quartile (xia in case). So, besides 1, we will use a behavior called a to Other polynomial 3f (x) to 2g (x) the highest degree among these smooth number for 4-college.... it is the modulus of the school's My degree. The degree of the polynomial is the highest power of the variable. For this polynomial, we know that the degree is 4. $2g(x)$ has a highest power of 6 from $g(x)$. Since 3 and 2 are constants, we just take the highest power between 4 and 6, which is $6\\color{\\gray}{(reason above, highest degree)}$. 3f(x)+2g(x)= 6 It stands for 3 $Prime level$ degree and afterwards $6level$. 3f(x)+2g(x) 3 $Prime level$. 4 degree and g(x) has a 6 To a second level in g(x). The $f(x)$ is polynomial factor. Both have been glossed.

        " \nHere\u2019s how to solve it:\nWhen you multiply a polynomial by a constant, you get a new polynomial. The degree of this new polynomial is the same as the degree of the original polynomial.\nWhen you add two polynomials, the degree of the result is the largest degree of the two original polynomials.\nTherefore, the degree of $3f(x) + 2g(x)$ is the maximum of either the degree of $f(x)$ (which is 4) or the degree of $g(x)$ (which is 6). Since 6 is greater than 4, the degree of $3f(x) + 2g(x)$ is $\\boxed{6}$!\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 6. I hope it is correct. Both problems are solved.
