        " \nLet's start by letting x + 5 = 9 (since |x + 5| = 9, it could be either x + 5 = 9 or x + 5 = -9).\nThen, we have x + 5 - 9 = 0, which simplifies to x - 4 = 0.\nNow, we can solve for x by adding 4 to both sides, giving us x = 4.\nNow, let's find the other possible solution. Let's use the other part of the equation: x + 5 = -9.\nThen, we have x + 5 + 9 = 0, which simplifies to x + 14 = 0.\nSolving for x, we get x = -14.\nNow that we have found both solutions, we can find the positive difference between them. To do this, we'll subtract the smaller value from the larger value:\n|4 - (-14)| = |4 + 14| = |18| = 18.\nSo, the positive difference between the solutions is 18.\nThe final answer is 18. I hope it is correct. ### 3.0  All Steps Input Area Output Area /done\n### INTRODUCTION\nUsing the concept of absolute value, we will find the positive difference between the solutions for |x+5| = 9. This is a simple and straightforward problem that requires careful calculation and attention to details. The problem involves simple algebraic manipulations and the use of the absolute value function.",
        " 4\n### Why? \nThe absolute value function is a way to find the distance between a point and the origin. It has a \"positive\" sign, which means that it will result in a positive value. We need to consider two scenarios, where x + 5 is either greater than or less than zero.\n#### Scenario 1: where x + 5 is greater than zero\nIn this scenario, |x + 5| = x + 5, since x + 5 is already positive. So, the equation is reduced to x + 5 = 9, and we need to solve for x.\nSubtract 5 from both sides: x + 5 - 5 = 9 - 5\nThis simplifies to x = 4.\n#### Scenario 2: where x + 5 is less than zero\nIn this scenario, |x + 5| = -(x + 5), since x + 5 is less than zero. So, the equation is reduced to -(x + 5) = 9, and we need to solve for x.\nMultiply both sides by -1: -(x + 5) * (-1) = 9 * (-1)\nThis simplifies to x + 5 = -9.\nSubtract 5 from both sides: x + 5 - 5 = -9 - 5\nThis simplifies to x = -14.\nSo, the two solutions are x = 4 and x = -14. To find the positive difference between these two solutions, we subtract the smaller value from the larger value:\n4 - (-14) = 4 + 14 = 18.\nHowever, the question is asking for the positive difference, which means we need to take the absolute value of the result:\n|18| = 18.\nSo, the positive difference between the solutions is 18. However, the question asked for the positive difference between the two solutions, which is 4. We can find this difference by subtracting the smaller value from the larger value:\n|-14| - 4 = -14 - 4 = -18.\nHowever, this is a negative value. To get a positive value, we can take the absolute value of the result:\n|-14| - 4 = -(18).\nSo, the positive difference between the solutions is indeed 4.\nThe moral of the story is that we must be careful when solving absolute value equations, as there are two scenarios to consider and we need",
        " \nThe absolute value equation can be written as |x + 5| = 9.\nTo find the solutions, we will consider two cases:\n1. If x + 5 \u2265 0, then we can write the equation as x + 5 = 9.\nSubtracting 5 from both sides gives us x = 4.\n2. If x + 5 < 0, then we can write the equation as -(x + 5) = 9.\nSubtracting 5 from both sides gives us -x = 4.\nMultiplying both sides by -1 gives us x = -4.\nThe positive difference between the solutions x = 4 and x = -4 is:\n|x - (-4)| = |(4) - (-4)| = |4 + 4| = |8| = 8.\n### Final Answer: The final answer is 8.

        " For |x + 5| = 9, we know that the opposite numbers are 9 and -9.

        " written response\nTo solve |x+5|=9, we can follow the following steps:\n1. |x+5|=9: First, we need to get rid of the absolute value signs. To do this, we can start by setting both the value inside the absolute value signs and the numerical value outside the absolute value signs equal to the expression, like this:\nx+5=9 and x+5=-9.\n2. Simplify both equations:\nx=4 and x=-14.\n### The solutions to the equation |x+5|=9 are x=4 and x=-14.\nTo find the positive difference between these two solutions, we need to subtract the smaller value from the larger value. That\u2019s because a difference minus a value is the same as a value minus the value/greater value.\nSince 4 > -14, we subtract the smaller value (-14) from the larger value (4), which gives us 18.\nSo, the positive difference between the solutions is 18. That\u2019s it!\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 18. I hope it is correct.",
        " \nWe have |x + 5| = 9.\nNow, let\u2019s look at it carefully. The absolute value means that whatever is inside the absolute value should be positive. So, x + 5 is positive. Hence, the equation can be written as:\nx + 5 = 9\nNow, subtract 5 from both sides:\nx = 4\nNow we have found one solution. But what about the other solution?\nWell, since the absolute value definition can also be thought of as the distance of a certain point from the origin, we can break it down like this:\nx + 5 = -9 \nThis can also be rewritten as:\nx = -14 \nSo, we have two solutions: x = 4 and x = -14. \nNow, let\u2019s find the absolute difference between these two solutions:\n|x - | = |-14 - 4| = | -18| = 18\nHence, the positive difference between the solutions is 18. \nSo, the answer is 18. \n### Explanation: \nAlthough I wasn't sure what the instruction meant, I finalized in interpreting it as finding the positive difference between the two solutions. And I did exactly that, finding the difference between x = 4 and x = -14, which is indeed 18. The solution to each part doesn't necessarily lead to this specific interpretation, so this is my understanding.   \n",
        " \n### |x + 5| = 9\nFirst, we can set up an equation to find the value of |x + 5|:\n|x + 5| = 9\nWe know that |x + 5| represents the distance from the point x + 5 on the number line to the origin. Since this distance is 9, we can set up an equation to solve for x:\n| x + 5 | = 9\nThe absolute value can be interpreted as the distance from the point on the number line, so we can set up an equation to solve for x:\nx + 5 = 9\nx + 5 - 5 = 9 - 5\nx = 4",
        " The textbook solution follows the steps:\nLet |x + 5| = 9.\n||x + 5| \u2265 0 (since the absolute value of a number is always greater than or equal to zero), so we can subtract 9 from both sides:\nx + 5 \u2265 9\nx \u2265 4\nSo, we have an equation x \u2265 4.\nNow, recall that the absolute value bar calculates the distance from zero to a number. For instance, the distance from 5 to zero is 5, but since 5 is greater than zero, we say that the absolute value bar hides the negative sign, and thus |5| = 5.\nSo, for our original equation |x + 5| = 9, let\u2019s think about the distance from x + 5 to zero. Since the absolute value bar hides the negative sign, we can represent the equation either with the positive distance:\nx + 5 \u2265 9\nx \u2265 4\nOr, the other way around, with the negative distance:\nx + 5 \u2264 -9\nx \u2264 -14\nIn the second case, you see that the equation becomes untrue since we already established x \u2265 4. Therefore, the correct solution can only be x \u2265 4, with the inequality being inclusive.\n### Review:\nTo get the different interpretation for the absolute value sign, consider an example. Assume we had |5 - 2| = 3. Here, |5 - 2| = 3 means that the distance from 5 - 2 (which equals 3) to zero is 3. So, we would say that |5 - 2| = 3, as it is indeed the difference from 5 - 2 to zero. By contradiction, we could also look for the distance from 2 - 5 (which equals -3) to zero, which equals 3, thus |2 - 5| = 3 as well!\n### Last point:\nSo, for |x + 5| = 9, the distance from x + 5 to zero could be either positive for x \u2265 4 or negative for x \u2264 -14. Both provide valid solutions, depending on how you interpret the absolute value sign. Therefore, the difference between these solutions is:\nx \u2265 4 - (x \u2264 -14)\nSince both are inequality statements, we must consider the union of the solutions, combining them by creating a new absolute value condition:\n|x + ",

        " Start by re-arranging the equation to isolate the x term.\n|x + 5| = 9 becomes |x + 5| - |9| = 0.\n### Simplify the equation:\nBefore simplifying, we need to consider the different cases for absolute value.",
        " 2\n|x + 5| = 9 is equivalent to |x + 5 \u2013 9| = |9 \u2013 9| which equals |x + 4| = 0. This is equivalent to x + 4 = 0. Solving for x, we get x = -4. The other solution would be x = -4 + 9 \u2013 5 = -1 because adding 9 and subtracting 5 leaves a remainder of the two absolute values expressed in the original equation.\nWe know |x + 5| = 9. The positive difference between -4 and -1 is 3 satisfying the condition |x + 5| - |x + 1| = 3. In the same manner, |x + 5| = 9 is also satisfied by |x \u2013 4| = 9. The positive difference between -1 and 4 is 5. However, we cannot find this difference because it is not relevant to the original equation. The positive difference between the solutions is 2, so the answer is 2. The two numbers that |x + 5| = 9 are -1 and 4, but we only focus on -4 and -1, the original solutions. The positive difference between both is 2.\n### Addendum: \nIn case you're wondering about the second method I mentioned, I'll write it below.\n|x + 5| = 9 is equivalent to either x + 5 = 9 or x + 5 = -9. The first equation becomes x = 4 which is not the correct answer to the difference. The second equation becomes x = -14 which is indeed the correct answer to the difference. However, x = 4 and x = -14 are not the original solutions of |x + 5| = 9.\nRemember, |x + 5| = 9 doesn't equal x + 5 = 9 or x + 5 = -9; it means the distance between the points x + 5 and 0 on the number line or the real axis is 9. The question asks for the positive difference between the original solutions of |x + 5| = 9, which is 2. We can conclude that 2 is the answer to the original problem, and I hope this clears up any confusion. However, I will try to find a more elegant way of expressing the difference.

        " \nA positive difference between the solutions means we need to find the difference between the two x values.\nThe equation is |x + 5| = 9.\nLet's start by graphing the equation. The graph of |x| = a is V-shaped, with the point (a,0) being the \"kink\" in the shape. For our equation, |x + 5| = 9, the graph would be the V-shape with the point (4,0) being the kink.\nNow let's think about the solutions. The |x| equation has two values: x = -a for the left side of the V and x = a for the right side of the V. \nFor our equation, |x + 5| = 9, the left side of the V is x + 5 = -9.\nSolving for x, we get x = -14.\nThe right side of the V is x + 5 = 9.\nSolving for x, we get x = 4.\nSo, the two solutions are -14 and 4.\nThe positive difference between the two solutions is 4 - (-14) = 4 + 14 = 18.\nSo, the positive difference between the two solutions for |x + 5| = 9 is 18.",
        " To find the solution, we can think of it as an absolute value equation. \nFor the absolute value equation |x + 5| = 9, we know that the equation is true in either of the two cases: \n1. x + 5 = 9 (when x = 4) \n2. x + 5 = -9 (when x = -4)\nSince we're looking for the positive difference between the two solutions, we'll subtract the smaller solution from the larger one: \n4 - (-4) = 8\nSo the positive difference between the solutions is 8.",
