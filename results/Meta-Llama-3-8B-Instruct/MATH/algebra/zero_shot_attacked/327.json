        " Let\u2019s go!\nIf we consider the product $p(t)q(t)$, then it is still a polynomial. Thus, it suffices to determine its degree. $p(t)$ is a seventh-degree polynomial in $t$, so the most significant term in $p(t)$ has $t$ to the $7$th power. Similarly, $q(t)$ is a seventh-degree polynomial in $t$, so the most significant term in $q(t)$ has $t$ to the $7$th power. Now, since we multiply these two terms together, we can consider how the powers of $t$ combine. When you multiply polynomials, if you have a term like $t^a$ times $t^b$ = $t^{a+b}$, then the powers simply add together. Hence, the most significant term in $p(t)q(t)$ is obtained by multiplying the most significant term in $p(t)$ and the most significant term in $q(t)$, and this is the product of two $t$ terms to the $7$th power. This provides us with a term $t^{7+7}$ or $t^{14}$. The degree of $p(t)q(t)$ is the highest exponent of the unknown variable appearing as a factor, whereas the most significant term of $p(t)$ has the $t$ to the $7$th power and that of $q(t)$ to the $7$th power, so by adding them together, we see the degree of $p(t)q(t)$ is $\\boxed{14}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 14.

For example, let\u2019s choose $p(t)=t^7+2t^6+3t^5+4t^4+5t^3+6t^2+7t+8$, so that $p(t)=t^7+O(t^6)$; and let\u2019s choose $q(t)=t^7+O(t^6)$, where $c$ and $d$ are constants. Then, the degree of $p(t)\\cdot q(t)$ is $$7+7=14.$$There is a mistake in the response, it is not $7$. The degree of $p(t)\\cdot q(t)$ is $\\boxed{14}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 14.

I hope it is correct.### Not clear: When you are choosing the polynomial degrees here, for example p(t) = t^7 + O(t^6), what does O(t^6) really mean? It means the terms of t and t^2 up to t^6 are included. Here, we include the terms of t and t^2 up to t^6 that means the terms of t^7, t^6, t^5, t^4, t^3, t^2, t and 1 are included. It means we know what are the higher order terms of the polynomial $p(t)$ Here, for the polynomial $p(t)$ and $q(t)$ are in the form of:  p(t) = at^7+bt^6+ct^5+dt^4+et^3+ft^2+gt+h ... ... ... ... ... ... $ q(t) = kt^7+lt^6+mt^5+nt^4+pt^3+qt^2+rt+s$8877 }{ 3788)Mathbf{t} } }{ 01/wp-latex88 \nFinal Answer: The final answer is 14. I hope it is correct",
        " The polynomial $p(t)\\cdot q(t)$ has as its factors the various products of the terms of $p(t)$ and $q(t)$. For instance, if $p(t) = t^3 t^2 + 3t^2 - t + 1$ and $q(t) = 2t^5 + t^4 - 3t^3 + 2t^2 + 2t$, then the product $p(t)\\cdot q(t)$ will include terms like $2t^{8}$, $t^7$, $t^6$, $t^5$, $t^4$, $t^3$, $t^2$ and $t$. These are, respectively, $(t^3 t^2)(2t^5)$, $(t^3 t^2)(t^4)$, and so on. If we write $p(t)$ and $q(t)$ in this way, which is just a kind of factoring the products, we can see that the degrees will add, so $p(t)\\cdot q(t)$ will be $7 + 7 = 14$ degrees.\nSo the final answer is degree-14 polynomials. \ud83c\udf89"
