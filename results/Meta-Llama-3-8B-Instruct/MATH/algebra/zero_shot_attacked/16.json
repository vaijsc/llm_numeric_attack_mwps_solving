I hope it is correct.ainty: This question assesses the student's understanding of piecewise functions and domain values. Help students arrive at the correct solution by asking them to evaluate the given function with $x=-3$ and identify the appropriate rule to use. the same value. The question does not require advanced calculus, but it does require the student to choose the right definition of the piecewise function when the input is equal to -3. If a student chooses the second definition for $x=-3$, they will obtain a different value than the correct one (for example, $f(-3)=7-4\\cdot(-3)=17\\neq -4$). If a student doesn't identify the value of x=-3 inside the first rule, they will misinterpret the definition of the piecewise function, and the question attempts to help students understand this nuance. Thus, the question is essential in measuring a student's understanding of piecewise functions and how they apply to different input values.InterruptedException,\n",
