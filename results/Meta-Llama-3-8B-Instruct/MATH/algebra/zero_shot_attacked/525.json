Since we know the relationship between $f(x)$ and $h(x)$, we can do this step by step.\n### Finding f(x):\n\\begin{align*}\nf(h(x)) &= x \\\\\nf(f(20)) &= 20 \\\\\n20 &= f(20) \\\\\n20 &= 2 \\\\\n\\end{align*}So, we know that $f(20) = 2.$ Similarly, we have\n\\begin{align*}\nf(h(10)) &= 10 \\\\\nf(1) &= 10 \\\\\nf(f(1)) &= 10 \\\\\nf(10) &= 10 \\\\\n\\end{align*}And we also have\n\\begin{align*}\nf(h(1)) &= 1 \\\\\nf(2) &= 1 \\\\\nf(f(2)) &= 1 \\\\\nf(1) &= 1 \\\\\n\\end{align*}Therefore, we know that $f(1) = 1.$ We will stop here for the moment. We have found $f(20) = 2$ and $f(1) = 1.$ We can use this to make an observation.",
        " The ever-changing $f(x) \\Rightarrow f^{-1}(x) = h(x)$. For example, if $f(2) = 4$, then $h(x) = f^{-1}(x)$ means $h(2) = 4$. Since $h(2) = 20$, this means $f^{-1}(2) = 20$, which in turn means $f(20)=2$. Similarly, we can find that $f(10) = 1$ and $f(1) = 2$.\nThus, $f(f(10)) = f(1) = \\boxed{2}$.\n## Step 2: $f(x)$ matches $h(x) = f^{-1}(x)$, a.k.a. the magic $f^{-1}(x)$ way\nIf $h(x)=f^{-1}(x)$, we have that $x=f(f^{-1}(x))=f(h(x))$. This is how you use the $f^{-1}(x)$ to solve the problem, step by step.",
        " If $h(2)=\\boxed{20}$, that means $$f(20)=2,$$ In a similar way, $$f(1)=10$$ and $$f(2)=10.$$ If $h(10)=1$, that means $$f^{-1}(1)=10.$$ Using Substitute, $$f^{-1}(f(10))=10\\Rightarrow\\boxed{f(10)=1.}$$We are done.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 1.

        " Given that $f(x)$ is an increasing function, we can deduce the following:\nf^{-1}(2)=h(2)=20\\qquad(1) f^{-1}(10)=h(10)=1\\qquad(2) f^{-1}(1)=h(1)=2\\qquad(3) Using $(1)$, we know that $f(20)=2$. Using $(2)$, we know that $f(1)=10$. Using $(3)$, we know that $f(2)=1$. Therefore, $f(f(10))=f(1)=\\boxed{10}$. Final Answer: The final answer is 10. I hope it is correct.  Since $f^{-1}(2)=20$ and $f^{-1}(1)=2$, we can deduce that $f(20)=2$, $f(2)=1$, and that $f$ is a decreasing function from left to right, exchanging the endpoint $2$ and $10$ in the interval $[0,10]$. This is related to the reflection about the line $y=x$ of the first quadrant, and flipping the curve, which must cause the original monotonically increasing curve to become a monotonically decreasing function in the new interval. Therefore, $f(f(10))=f(1)=\\boxed{10}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 10. I hope it is correct.  Therefore, it is easy.  \\begin{align*}\nf^{-1}(2)&=20\\\\\nf(20)&=2\\\\\nf^{-1}(1)&=2\\\\\nf(2)&=1\\\\\nf(1)&=10\\\\\nf(f(10))&=f(1)=\\boxed{10}\n\\end{align*}\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 10.

        " The inverse function of $f(x)$ is $h(x)$. Then we have $h(x)=f^{-1}(x)$, which implies that $y=h(x)$ if and only if $x=f(y)$. Therefore, we can write $f(h(x))=x$. Now, we have\n\\begin{align*}\nf(h(2))&=2,\\\\\nf(h(10))&=10,\\\\\nf(h(1))&=1.\n\\end{align*}Substituting, we obtain \\begin{align*}\nf(20)&=2,\\\\\nf(1)&=10,\\\\\nf(2)&=1.\n\\end{align*}\nNow it follows that $f(f(10))=f(1)=\\boxed{10}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 10.
