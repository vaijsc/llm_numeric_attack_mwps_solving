These systems of linear equations worksheets involve two linear equations, and the same variables appear in both linear equations. For linear systems, we can use methods like substitution, elimination, and graphical methods to solve the equations. Non-linear systems of linear equations, however, require a different approach, such as solving simultaneously or graphically. Solving the Systems of Linear Equations worksheets provides an opportunity for students to apply various mathematical strategies to solve systems of linear equations.\n### Problem: In this study, we looked at how different families approach solving systems of linear equations.

        " We know that $f(q(2)) = f(b(2) + 1) = (b(2) + 1) - 3 = b(2) + 1 - 3$. Therefore, if $f(q(2)) = -3$ we have\n$b(2) + 1 - 3 = -3$, hence $b(2) = -5$. Therefore $b = \\boxed{-\\frac{5}{2}}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -\\frac{5}{2}. I hope it is correct. \u00a0I \u00a0hope\u00a0 it is \u00a0correct. I hope it is correct.
