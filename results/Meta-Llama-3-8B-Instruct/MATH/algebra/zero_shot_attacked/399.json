If we had $c=0$, we had a division by zero, so this function does not make sense for this case.  Furthermore, we should expect that if we multiply the numerators by a nonzero constant, we should get back the same fraction.  That is, for nonzero numbers $a$, $b$, and $c$, we should have\n\\[D(ka,kb,kc)=k\\,\\text{{D}}(a,b,c).\\]We do get this,\nsince\n\\[D(ka,kb,kc)=\\frac{kabc}{ka+kb+kc}=\\frac{kabc}{k(a+b+c)}=\\frac{abc}{a+b+c}=D(a,b,c).\\]  We should also expect that if $a$ is zero, the fraction is zero.  That is, we should have\n$D(a+b,c,0)=0$ if $a+b>0$.  Indeed, we have that\n\\[D(a+b,c,0)=\\frac{(a+b)c}{a+b+c}=c.\\]But we also see that\n\\[D(a,b,c)=\\frac{abc}{a+b+c}=0\\]if $abc=0$ and $a+b+c>0$.

I hope it is correct.\nMethod 1: Plugging values\nWe will plug the values of a=2, b=8, c=6 in the given expression.\n\\text{{D}}(a,b,c)=\\frac{abc}{a+b+c}\\\\=\\frac{(2)(8)(6)}{2+8+6}\\\\=96/16\\\\=3\n#Method 1: Plugging values\nMethod 2: Simplifying Expression\nWe can simplify the expression in the numerator first.\nabc=2*8*6=96\nNow, we can simplify the denominator.\na+b+c=2+8+6=16\nNow, we will put the value of numerator and denominator in the given expression.\n\\text{{D}}(a,b,c)=\\frac{abc}{a+b+c}\\\\=\\frac{96}{16}\\\\=3\n#Method 2: Simplifying Expression\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 3. I hope it is correct. The method of plugging values or simplifying the expression provide the same answer i.e., 3. If you with to know more or if there is any other method then you can ask. I will be happy to help.  This is a simple problem.  We are given $a$, $b$, and $c$, three non-zero numbers and a function $D$ defined by $D(a,b,c)=\\frac{abc}{a+b+c}.$\nTo solve this problem, we simply plug in the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$, to get the function $D$.\n$$D(2,8,6)=\\frac{(2)(8)(6)}{2+8+6}=\\frac{96}{16}=3$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 3. I hope it is correct. His problem can be solved in an easier way by plugging in the values directly. I used a fraction in the above solution, so it can be seen that plugging in",
