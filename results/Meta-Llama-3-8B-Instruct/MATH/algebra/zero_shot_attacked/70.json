Complex numbers can be expressed commonly in either rectangular form or trigonometric form, where in general, z=a+bi is called the rectangular form, and Z=a+bi=a+bi is called the trigonometric form, where a and b are real numbers, and i = -1. \nIn rectangular form, the form of complex numbers can be either $$ z=a+bi $$\n$$ z=a+bi $$\nOR\n$$ z=a_1+b_1i+a_2+b_2i $$\n$$ z=a_1+b_1i+a_2+b_2i $$\nIn the rectangular form, all these forms are general numbers, which is the number of possible forms of complex numbers. However, they have a certain feature.\nIn the rectangular form, it can make it difficult to calculate and simplify complex calculations.\nOn the other hand, in trigonometric form, the form can be written as:\n$$ Z=a+bi=a+bi=a+bi $$\n$$ Z=a+bi=a+bi=a+bi $$\nThis form is called the trigonometric form or the polar form.\nIn this form, the angle $$\\theta$$ is called the angle of the complex number.\nComplex numbers can be also added and subtracted. for example.\nThe result of the addition or subtraction of complex numbers in rectangular form:\n$$ (a_1 + b_1 i) + (a_2 + b_2 i) = (a_1 + a_2) + (b_1 + b_2) i $$\n$$ $$\nAnd the result of the multiplication of complex numbers in rectangular form:\n$$ (a_1 + b_1 i) * (a_2 + b_2 i) = a_1 a_2 + (b_1 a_2 + b_2 a_",
