Thank you. -3 -10 0.3/3.4 8/35\" . 1/3, 2/5 1/3 - 2/5. 2/5 - 1/3 the long distance between (1,2) and (-3,-10) is (1-(-3),2-(-10)) = (4,12) is \u221a(4\u00b2+12\u00b2)=2\u221a41. the length of the segment unit is 2\u221a41 units. Please let me know if you need more information. Thank you. Example\nIn the coordinate plane,  Find the length of the segment $\\overline{AB}$  whose endpoints are $A\\left(2,-5\\right)$ and $B\\left(-3,8\\right)$.\nSolution\nThe distance between two points is the distance formula: $$\\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2}$$ The point $A$ is given as $(2,-5)$ and the point $B$ is given as $(-3,8)$, so we have: \\begin{align*}[(2-(-3))-((-5)-8)]^2+&([(8)-((-5)))]^2]\\\\ &=[(2+3)-((-5)+8)]^2+[(8)+5]^2\\\\ &=((5)+(8))^2+13^2\\\\ &=13^2+169\\\\ &=\\sqrt{169+169}\\\\ &=\\boxed{\\sqrt{338}}\\end{align*} Therefore the length of the segment $\\overline{AB}$ is $\\boxed{\\sqrt{338}}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\sqrt{338}$. I hope it is correct.",
        " \nFirst, I can find the coordinates of the point that is exactly \"in between\" each endpoint. Use a unit distance.\nTo do this, add the x and y coordinates of the two endpoints. In this case:\n(1,2), (-3,-10)\nI can get the following by adding:\n(1 + (-3)) = -2 (the x-coordinate of the point in between)\n(2 + (-10)) = -8 (the y-coordinate of the point in between)\nSo, the point that is exactly \"in between\" each endpoint is (-2, -8).\nNext, I can use the distance formula:\nDistance = \u221a((x2 - x1)\u00b2 + (y2 - y1)\u00b2)\nIn this case, (x2 - x1) = (-2 - 1) = -3 (the difference between the x-coordinates of the two endpoints)\n(y2 - y1) = (-8 - 2) = -10 (the difference between the y-coordinates of the two endpoints)\nSo, the distance is:\nDistance = \u221a((-3)\u00b2 + (-10)\u00b2) = \u221a(9 + 100) = \u221a109\nWhich means the segment is 109 units long. \u220e",
        " \nA segment is defined by its two endpoints. The key here is to find the distance between these two points. We can use the distance formula:\nd = \u221a((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2)\nWe know that the two endpoints are (1,2) and (-3,-10), so we can plug in the values:\nx1 = 1, y1 = 2\nx2 = -3, y2 = -10\nNow, let\u2019s calculate the distance:\nd = \u221a((-3-1)^2 + (-10-2)^2)\n= \u221a((-4)^2 + (-12)^2)\n= \u221a(16 + 144)\n= \u221a160\n= 12.65 units\nSo, the segment is approximately 12.65 units long.\n#### Ends: How many units long is a segment whose endpoints are (1,2) and (-3,-10)?"
