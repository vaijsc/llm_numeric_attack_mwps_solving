        " We first multiply the left-hand side to get\n$$(x+1)(x+2) = x^2 + 3x + 2 = x^2 + 3x + 1 + 1 = (x+1)^2 + 1.$$We now recognize this as a quadratic expression that is equal to $x+3$. Therefore, the equation becomes $$(x+1)^2 = x+2,$$or $$(x+1)^2 - x - 2 = 0.$$Now, to write this as a sum of two squares, we first use the completion-of-the-square formula to rewrite $(x+1)^2$ as $$(x+1)^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1 = x^2 + 2x + 1 + 1 - 1 = (x+1)^2 - 1.$$Then we have $$(x+1)^2 - x - 2 = \\left((x+1)^2 - 1\\right) - (x+1) -2 = (x+1)^2 - 1 - x - 2= (x+1)^2 - (x+1) - 3.$$\nWe now use this to factor the left-hand side of the equation, and since the middle expression $x+1$ appears in at least one of the factors, we should focus on the $-3$ on the right-hand side and ask what minus 3 subtracted from $(x+1)^2$ could be. It is $x^2+2x+1 -3 = x^2 + 2x -2 = (x+2)(x) = x(x+2)$, and so our factors are $x$ and $(x+1)^2$.\nWe now try the usual guessing approach to see if one of the factors has an integer value, and after some guesswork, we figure out that $x = -1$ works, giving $(x+2)(x+1)$ as 0. Of course, since this expression has to equal $x+3$, that means 0 has to equal $x+3$, which has its own solution of $x = -2$.\nTherefore, we have $x = -1 \\pm \\sqrt{-1}$ as our two solutions.\nThus, $m = -1$ and $n = -1$, giving $m+n = \\boxed{-2",
        " \nLet us begin from the given equation $(x+1)(x+2)=x+3$. We can write this equation as:\n$$x^2+3x+2=x+3$$\nNow let us subtract $x+3$ from both sides to get\n$$x^2+2x-1=0$$\nNow we need to find the values of $x$ by factoring it. To do this, we need to find two numbers whose product is $-1$ and sum is $2$. Since this is a quadratic equation, we know the formula to factor it is $(a+b)(a+b)=a^2+b^2+2ab$. In this case, we can write it as $(x+m)(x+n)=0$, where $m+n=2$ and $mn=-1$. It means, for the first factoring, $m$ must be $1$ and $n$ must be $1$, giving us $(x+1)(x+1)=0$. After factoring it, we can write $(x+1)^2=0$, from which we get $x+1=0$ or $x=-1$. However, our second factoring must be a $(x+3)$ factor. That\u2019s why we will find another pair $m$ and $n$. The other pair has $m$ being $-1$ and $n$ being $1$, giving us $(-1+1)(x+1)=0$. So the factoring becomes $(x-1)(x+1)=0$, from which we get $x-1=0$ or $x=1$. So, $(x-1)(x+1)=0$ can be written as:\n$$\\boxed{(x+1)(x+2)=(x+3)}$$\nNow we are back to where we started.

        " This is a standard quadratic in disguise, and we have a quadratic formula x=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}. Here $a=1$, $b=-4$ and $c=2$. Plugging the values into the formula, we get $x=\\frac{-(-4)\\pm\\sqrt{(-4)^2-4\\cdot1\\cdot2}}{2\\cdot1}=\\frac{4\\pm\\sqrt{12}}{2}=2\\pm\\sqrt{3}$. So we get $m=2, n=3$ so $m+n=\\boxed{5}$. Another approach is to factor the left side: $x^2+3x+2=x+3$, so let\u2019s substitute $x=z-\\frac{3}{2}$.

However we are told that the principal solutions are real, so we ignore this imaginary part. Then we note that $(z-\\frac{3}{2})+(z-\\frac{3}{2})=x+1$ and $(z-\\frac{3}{2})\\cdot(z-\\frac{3}{2})=x+2$, and from this we know that $z-\\frac{3}{2}=x+1$ and $z-\\frac{3}{2}=x+2$.
