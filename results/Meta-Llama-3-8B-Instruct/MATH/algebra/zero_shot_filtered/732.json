The $x^2$ term cannot change sign when it factors.  The associated constant term, which is -6 here, cannot be positive, since that would require $x^2$ to be negative somewhere in its domain (and we know $x^2\\ge0$ for all $x$).\nTherefore, completing the square, we get $$(x+2.5)^2-6.25+c>0$$ or, equivalently, $$(x+2.5)^2>\\frac{1}{4}$$ for all $x\\ne\\pm2$, it follows that $c=\\frac{1}{4}$.  Since there aren\u2019t any complex roots, our quadratic is a square.  So, our quadratic is $(x+2.5)^2$.\nSo, $b+c=2.5+\\frac{1}{4}=1$.

        " (1)\nWe note that the equation $x^2+bx+c=0$ has two distinct roots (or solutions) $x_1, x_2$ if its discriminant $b^2-4c$ is positive.  The quadratic polynomial is positive if both of its roots are negative, or both are positive, by the root test.  In the given case, the roots are $x_1, x_2$ where $$x_1 < -2 < x_2.$$We see that the roots are negative and different.  Hence we can apply the root test to say that the quadratic is positive only when both roots are negative (or away from the intervals given).  The roots are like there and hence we see that it is positive only when $$x \\in \\boxed{(-\\infty, -2)\\cup(3,\\infty)}$$In particular, $$2 > -2 \\mbox{ and } 2 < 3$$Let\u2019s think of this equation $x^2+bx+c=0$ as a quadratic.  We know the discriminant $b^2-4c$ will be positive, so we want The angle of the quadratic $$x^2+bx+c=0$$ is lesser than the acute angle between $$x^2+2x+1=0$$ and $$x^2-2x+1=0.$$\n### Solution Explanation:\nWe know that the quadratic polynomial $x^2+bx+c$ will have two distinct roots $x_1, x_2$ if the discriminant $b^2-4c$ is positive.  As given, the quadratic $x^2+bx+c>0$ only when $x\\in (\\infty,-2]\\cup[3,\\infty)$.  Hence the roots $x_1, x_2$ of $x^2+bx+c=0$ are $x_1 < -2$ and $x_2 > 2$.  This is possible only when the quadratic $x^2+bx+c$ is positive when $x$ is outside the interval $[-2,2]$ and hence the value of $b+c$ is 5.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 5. I hope it is correct. (1)\n### Solution\n(1) Solve for $b+c$ by setting $x^2+bx+c>0$ only when $x\\in (-",
        " \nConsider the quadratic function $f(x)=x^2+bx+c$. It is true that $f(x)>0$ on the intervals $(-\\infty, -2)\\cup(3,\\infty)$. The zero of a function $g$ occur where $g(x)=0$; equivalently, where $g$ intersects the horizontal line $y=0$. There are two solutions which are $-2$ and $3$ because:\n$$\\begin{array}{rcl}\nf(-2)&=&-4+2b+c>0\\\\\nf(3)&=&9+3b+c>0\n\\end{array}$$The function $f$ has minimum value $-4+2b+c$ at $x=-2$ and maximum value $9+3b+c$ at $x=3$. The function is always less than or equal to its maximum value, so when $f(x)>0$, $-4+2b+c<-4+9+3b+c$, which is whenever $5+c>0$, and $9+3b+c>9+3b+c$, which is always true. Therefore $f(x)>0$ whenever $x \\in(-\\infty, 2)$. We also have that $f(x)>0$ whenever $x>3$, because $f$ intersects the line $y=0$ at $x=-2$ and $x=3$, and the function decreases (since the derivative is $2x+b$) and approaches $-\\infty$ as $x$ approaches $-\\infty$, and increases and approaches $\\infty$ as $x$ approaches $\\infty$, so we can conclude that it can only be greater than 0 in the intervals $(-\\infty,-2)$ and $(3,\\infty)$. That means that $x^2+bx+c>0$ only when $x\\in (-\\infty,-2)\\cup(3,\\infty)$.\nThe sum $b+c$ is equal to $-4+9=\\boxed{5}$. In fact, we may also conclude that $b+c = 5$ because $\\Delta=4b^2c-(2b+c)^2=0$ when $x^2+bx+c$ has no roots in the intervals, and $b+c = -4+2b+c$, so $\\Delta=0$, which gives the result.",
        " Since $x^2+bx+c>0$ for $x\\in (-\\infty, -2)\\cup(3,\\infty)$, the discriminant of $x^2+bx+c$ must be less than zero. Therefore,\n\\begin{align*}\n(b^2-4c)&<0.\n\\end{align*}This inequality means that $$|b^2|<4|c|,$$ which implies that $\\boxed{b+c<0}$.\nDo cases: Since we have only one root in between $-2$ and $3$, we could be having the following:\n1. If the roots are complex, then the above case wouldn\u2019t be possible. But since we only have one root, the roots must be real.\n2. If the roots are real, then the above case would be possible. However, taking reciprocal of both sides, it would also be possible that $b^2-4c>0$. We cannot include the case where $b^2-4c>0$ because this case has two real roots, and thus not applicable in this case. Hence, we only need to take $b^2-4c<0$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is b+c<0. I hope it is correct.  Source: kv linear algebra 84 problem\nFinal Answer: The final answer is b+c<0. I hope it is correct.  Source: kv linear algebra 84 problem\nI think there is an issue with this problem. It's not necessary to assume that the roots are real. We only need to find the value of $b+c$ when the quadratic equation has no real solutions. If we let $x^2+bx+c=0$, then we want to find the values of $b$ and $c$ such that the equation has no real solutions. This is true only when $b^2-4c<0$.\nThe only possible solution here is the parabola $b^2-4c=0$. If we substitute $b^2-4c=0$ into the equation $x^2+bx+c=0$, we find that the equation $x^2+bx+c=0$ has a single solution $\\frac{b}{2}$.\nThis occurs when $x=\\frac{b}{2}$. Therefore, the equation $x^2+bx+c=0$ has no roots when $x\\in (-\\",
        " The quadratic function $f(x) = x^2 + bx + c$ can have two zeroes at $x_1=-3$, $x_2=2$ and be positive at $x<-3$ and at $x>2$.\n### Analysis:\nAccording to the quadratic formula, the zeroes of $x^2+bx+c$ are\n\\begin{align*}\nx&=\\frac{-b\\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4c}}{2}\\\\\n&=\\frac{2\\pm \\sqrt{(-2-b)^2-4c}}{2}\\\\\n&=\\frac{2\\pm \\sqrt{b^2+4b+4c-4}}{2}\\\\\n&=\\frac{2\\pm \\sqrt{(b+2)^2-4(2-c)}}{2}\\\\\n&=\\frac{-1\\pm \\sqrt{(b+2)^2-4(2-c)}}{2\\text{ etc}\\\\\n&=1\\pm \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{b+2}{2}\\right)^2-(2-c)}.\n\\end{align*}\nSo we must have $(b+2)/2=\\pm 1$ or $(b+2)/2\\geq\\sqrt{2-c}$.

        " The quadratic equation $x^2+bx+c$ will have real solutions only if the discriminant is non-negative, which means $(b^2-4c)\\ge 0$.

There are many possible ways to answer this question.\nOne of ways is to use the information from previous given form, that is, from the quadratic equation form. The quadratic equation $x^2+bx+c$ has two roots $a$ and $b$, then\n$$x^2+bx+c=(x-a)(x-b)=x^2-(a+b)x+ab$$So, we have $b=a+b$ and $c=ab$, especially, $b=a+b$ is the well known Vieta\u2019s formula for the sum of roots of quadratic equation, it means $b=-a$, and so the quadratic equation $x^2+bx+c$ is a shortcut, we can just substitute $b=-a$ in the expression of $x^2+bx+c$, we have\n$$x^2+bx+c=x^2-ax+a^2$$Now, the quadratic equation is $x^2-ax+a^2=0$, because it has only one real root $x=2$,  we have $a=2$ and $c=a^2=4$,  thus we have $b=-2$ then $$b+c=4-2=2$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2.

        " If $x^2+bx+c>0$ only when $x\\in (-\\infty, -2)\\cup(3,\\infty)$, this means that there is no real solution of $x^2+bx+c=0$ within $[-2, 3]$.

        " At $x=-2$, $x^2+bx+c=(-2)^2+b(-2)+c=4-2b+c.$  We know that this expression has to be positive.  By assuming a smaller range of the domain which contains $x=-2$, we can conclude that $4-2b+c=0$ since $x^2+bx+c>0$ for $x$ near $-2$.  On the other hand, at $x=3$, $x^2+bx+c=3^2+b(3)+c=9+3b+c.$  Since we know that $x^2+bx+c>0$ for $x$ near $3$, we have that $9+3b+c>0$.  Identities derived by plugging in values work well in solving this problem.  We begin by using the fact that $9+3b+c>0\\Rightarrow9+c>3b.$  If we rearrange, we will have $3b<9+c.$  We use the fact that $4-2b+c=0\\Rightarrow4=c-2b.$  We plug in this into the inequality we derived in the last line to have $3b<9+c\\Rightarrow3b<9+(c-2b)\\Rightarrow3b+2b<9+c+c\\Rightarrow5b<11+c.$  We divide both sides by 5 to get $b<\\frac{11+c}{5}.$  Next, we have to consider cases on $b$.  Since $b<\\frac{11+c}{5},$ we consider the case when $b=\\frac{11+c}{5}+1$.  This is because $c-2b$ is an ascending function of $b$ on the interval $b<\\frac{11+c}{5}+1$, on which our interval lies.  Plugging this value of $b$ back into $4-2b+c=0$, we see that $4-2\\left(\\frac{11+c}{5}+1\\right)+c=0\\Rightarrow4-(11+c)+5+c=0\\Rightarrow-c-7=0\\Rightarrow c=7.$  Now, we can find our expression for $b+c$, which has value $\\boxed{4}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 4.

We can use the quadratic formula to find the roots:\n$$x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4c}}{2}$$\nIn this case, we have\n$$b = -5,\\quad c = 6,$$so the roots are:\n$$x_1 = \\frac{-(-5) \\pm \\sqrt{(-5)^2 - 4(6)}}{2} = \\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{1}}{2} =",
        " We have to find $b+c$ when $f(x)=x^2+bx+c$ is positive only for $x< -2$ and $x> 3$. Hence $f(x)>0$ or equivalently $x^2+bx+c>0$ on $\\mathbb{R}-(-2,3)=(-\\infty, -2)\\cup(3,\\infty)$.Note that if $x$ is positive, then $x^2$ and $f(x)$ are positive. If $x$ is negative, $x^2$ is positive and $f(x)$ is negative iff $x^2+bx+c<0\\Rightarrow c<0$ or $x^2+bx+c<0\\Rightarrow-bx+c>0\\Rightarrow c>0$, which is a contradiction. So, $x^2+bx+c\\geq0$.If $f(3)=0$, then $x^2+bx+c=0$ has a root at $x=3$. Rewriting this equation, we obtain $x^2+bx+c=0\\Rightarrow x^2+bx+c=(x-3)(x+d)$, for some $d$ by the factorization of quadratic equation. Expanding the equation, we get $x^2+bx+c=x^2+3x-dx-c=x^2+(b+d)x+c$. Thus, we have $b+d=3$ and $c=-d$, so $b=3-d$ or $d=3-b$, and $c=-d=d-3$, so $c=3-b$. Since we want $x> 3$, we get $c=3-b>0\\Rightarrow b<3$. Thus, for both $x<2$ and $x>3$, we can write \\begin{align}\nf(x)&=x^2+bx+c=(x-(-2))(x-3)\\\\\n&=x^2-(-2)x-3x+6=x^2+(3-d)x+6.\n\\end{align}In order to find $d$, we want $f(-2)=0$, i.e. $(-2)^2+(-2)b+c=0$.

        " The meaning of the problem\nFirst, we need to know what kind of inequality the problem is asking for: $x^2+bx+c > 0$. It is a quadratic inequality, and it\u2019s asking for what values of $x$ it is true.\nWe know that a parabola opens upwards when the discriminant is negative. In this case, the $x^2+bx+c > 0$ becomes $x^2+bx+c - c > 0 - c$, and factoring out the $c$ gives us $c(x^2+bx+(b^2/4))+(c-c) > 0 - c$. Since we now have an expression wrapped in parentheses, we can apply the quadratic formula! $\\displaystyle x = \\dfrac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$. This is where things get interesting. When we look at the discriminant, $b^2-4ac$, it\u2019s too late for me to draw a picture, so let\u2019s just agree that $b^2-4ac<0$. This is when the expression opens upwards!",

I hope it is correct.",
        " $\\boxed{-5}$\nFrom the quadratic formula, we know $x=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4c}}{2}$. This is real when $b^2-4c>0$, and has 2 distinct real roots when $b^2-4c>0$.\nSince there are no real roots in $(-\\infty,-2)$ and $(3,\\infty)$, we can use the quadratic formula to find that these intervals have no real roots. In the meantime, the polynomial $x^2+bx+c$ has no real roots in these intervals.\nAnd if $b^2-4c\\le0$, that means there is only 1 real root or no real roots. But we are told there are 2 real roots, which is impossible in the original intervals.\nLet $d=x^2+bx+c$, we know there will be no real roots in $(-\\infty,-2)$ and $(3,\\infty)$. Therefore, we must have $d>0$ in $(-\\infty,-2)\\cup(3,\\infty)$.\nIf $d>0$, then $d$ has no real roots. Therefore, the extremes of $d$ should be at the desired interval.\nIf $x\\rightarrow -\\infty$, then $d\\rightarrow +\\infty$. Since there is no real root in this interval, we know that $d$ is a limiting point of $+\\infty$.\nIf $x\\rightarrow +\\infty$, then $d\\rightarrow +\\infty$. Again, since there is no real root in this interval, we know that $d$ is a limiting point of $+\\infty$.\nFrom here, we know that $d$ is always $+\\infty$ outside of $x\\in(-2,3)$. And outside of the desired intervals, there is only 1 real root.\nSince there are no real roots outside of the desired intervals, we know that $d$ is $+\\infty$ for all $x$ because the extremes of this polynomial are both $+\\infty$.\nSince we are told that $d$ has no roots outside of $x\\in{-2,3}$, we know that $d<0$ in $x\\in(-2,3)$.\nFrom $d(x) = x^2 + bx + c$, when $d<0$, we",
        " We first note that $x^2+bx+c\\ge 0$ is true for all $x\\in (3,\\infty)$ if and only if its discriminant $(b^2-4c)\\le 0$ holds, and this requires $b^2-4c\\le 0$, or, $b^2\\le 4c$. Furthermore, it holds for all $x\\in(-\\infty,-2)$, for the same reason, if $b^2\\ge4c$.  Therefore, combining these two conditions, $b^2\\le 4c \\le b^2$, we have $b^2=4c$, which implies $c=\\frac{b^2}{4}$.  So, we can write $x^2+bx+c=(x+\\frac{b}{2})^2-\\frac{b^2}{4}+\\frac{b^2}{4}=(x+\\frac{b}{2})^2$.  In this form, we see that $x^2+bx+c$ is positive if $(x+\\frac{b}{2})^2>0$.  This is always true if $(x+\\frac{b}{2})\\neq 0$, i.e., $x\\neq -\\frac{b}{2}$.  However, for $x\\in [-\\frac{b}{2}, -2)\\cup(3,-\\frac{b}{2})$ , $(x+\\frac{b}{2})^2=0$, meaning $x^2+bx+c=0$.  This tells us that these effects must all be merged into a single interval in such a way that $(x+\\frac{b}{2})^2$ cannot exceed $0$ over that interval.  Clearly, itself must be this interval.  The endpoints of it are $x=-\\frac{b}{2}$ and $x=3$.  It is easy to verify that $x=-\\frac{b}{2}$ is really the end of this interval as it makes the leading term of $(x+\\frac{b}{2})^2$ in absolute value the greatest.  Plugging it, we have $(x+\\frac{b}{2})^2=(x-\\frac{b}{2})^2$.  In the same way, we have $x=3$.  Thus, the only possible function is",
        " Suppose $f(x)=x^2+bx+c$. Then $f' (x)=2x+b$ and the roots of $f$ are at $x=-2$ and $x=3$.\nThen $f'(x)>0$ on $(-\\infty,-2)$ and $f'(x)<0$ on $(-2,3)$, and $f'(x)>0$ on $(3,\\infty)$. Thus the second derivative at $x=-2$ is $f''(-2)=2$. And the second derivative at $x=3$ is $f''(3)=2$. (A graph is below)\nUsing the quadratic formula, we have $$-2=\\frac{-b+\\sqrt{b^2-4c}}{2},\\qquad 3=\\frac{-b-\\sqrt{b^2-4c}}{2}.$$ Subtracting the equations gives $$5=\\sqrt{b^2-4c}\\Rightarrow b^2-4c=25\\Rightarrow b^2=29.$$ Plugging this into $f(x)$ gives $f(x)=x^2+bx+c=x^2+\\sqrt{29}x+\\frac{29-29}{4}=\\left(x^2+\\frac{\\sqrt{29}}{2}x+\\frac{29}{4}\\right)=\\left(x+\\frac{\\sqrt{29}}{2}\\right)^2$, which is always nonnegative. Therefore the original inequality was always true. In other words, $b+c=29/4$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 29/4. I hope it is correct.

Therefore, we know that b + c = 2 + (-3) + 6. + 6, so b + c = -5. We have reached our solution. Finished.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is b+\\color{blue}{c}= \\boxed{-5}. I hope it is correct. ### Final Answer: The final answer is b+c=-5. I hope it is correct. Another approach: $x^2+bx+c>0$ is equivalent to $f(x)=x^2+bx+c$, and so on. For $f(x)$ to be greater than zero, its roots have to be on different sides of its vertex. The roots are at $\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$, which in this case are -2 and 3. So, $f(x)$ would be greater when $x$ is less than -2 or greater than 3. So, b+c=(-2)+3=\\boxed{-5}. We have reached our solution. Finished. Final Answer: The final answer is b+c=-5. I hope it is correct. Final Answer: The final answer is b+c=-5. I hope it is correct. Next### Final Answer: The final answer is b+c=-5. I hope it is correct. Final Answer: The final answer is b+c=-5.
