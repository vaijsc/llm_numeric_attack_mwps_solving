Let's check it.  -30 <= x <= 26, the set of integers in this set are -30, -29, -28, ..., 0, 1, 2, ..., 25, 26.  There are 57 integers in total in this set.  The sum of all of these integers is (Sum of positive integers) - (Sum of negative integers).  Since we are asked for the sum of all integers in this set, we don't need to subtract the sum of negative integers.  The sum of all these integers is (Sum of positive integers). The sum of the first positive integer, -25, to 26 is 26 * 27 / 2 = 351.  So, the sum of all the integers is 351.  Observer: That's nice.  Final Answer: The final answer is 351. I hope it is correct.

I hope it is correct.oruie\n### Explanation:\nLet\u2019s think step by step.\nLet\u2019s write out the integers in the range: -30,-29,-28,....,-1,0,1,2,...,25,26.\nNow let\u2019s calculate the sum of all the terms.  The key point here is that we are adding an alternating sequence of positive and negative numbers.  The sum of the first 15 positive numbers is equivalent to the sum of the first 15 negative numbers.  Thus, the whole sum is $0$.  Now we just need to calculate the sum of the two extreme numbers:\n$$(-30) + 26 = -4.$$Multiplying this by $2$ since we have to count the two numbers and adding the two terms is the same.  The answer is $\\boxed{156}$.\n### Proof: \nLet $S = (-30) + (-29) + (-28) + \u2026 + (-1) + 0 + 1 + 2 + \u2026 + 25 + 26$.  Note that we can write:\n\\begin{align*}S &= \\left((-30) + 26\\right) + \\left((-29) + 25\\right) + \\left((-28) + 24\\right) + \u2026 + 0 + (1 + 2 + \u2026 + 25).\\end{align*}Now, note that we have $(-29)$ and $25$ as the summands, $(-28)$ and $24$ as the summands, and so on.  Also observe that we can write $\\left([-30] + 26\\right) + \\left([-29] + 25\\right) + \\left([-28] + 24\\right)\u2026 = 0$ inasmuch as $(-30) + 26 = 0$ inasmuch as the terms $(-29) + 25 = 0$ and so on and even more. Therefore, we have $0 + (1 + 2 + \u2026 + 25)$.  Now note that $1 + 2 + 3\u2026+25$ is an arithmetic sequence with $n = 25$ and $a = 1$ and $d = 1$ and its sum is $S_{25} = 75 \\times \\frac{25}{2}",

Since we have an equal number of positive and negative numbers, the sum of all integer $x$ with $-30 \\leq x \\leq 26$ is\n$$\\frac{-30 + 26}{1}=\\boxed{-4}.$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -4.

The problem's intention is related to the sum of the integers within a provided range.\nOur aim is to calculate the average (aka the mean) of the numbers from -30 to 26. To achieve this, we can make use of a mathematical formula: (max-value+min-value)/2.\nHere we will have the following data:\n* Maximum value: 26 (the right part of the range)\n* Minimum value: -30 (the left part of the range)\nNow we just simply apply the formula:\n(26 + (-30)) / 2 = -2\nNow we need to calculate the sum of all integers within this range. To do so, we add the range's width to -2. The range is -30 to 26, which is a width of 56 units. So:\n-2 + 56 = 54\nFinally, we need to get the mean by multiplying the width with the constant (1/2):\n(1/2) * 54 = 27\nSo, the answer here should be 27. ****** Walter solution **\nI believe that the solution provided above accurately addresses the original problem. It correctly calculates the mean (average) of the integers within the given range, using the formula (max-value+min-value)/2, then adds the range's width (which is 56 units) to this value to get the final result of 54",
