        " Firstly, since $a$ and $b$ are consecutive integers, we know that $b = a + 1$.

Therefore, $a$ is $\\boxed{4}$.I hope this goes well. Let me know if you have any problems. Both variables, a and b, satisfy the equation if the values of both variables satisfy the equation. So, first I try to solve for one of the variables, let's say a. Say, I have the equation x + 2 = y, and I want to solve for x. How can I do that? Here, I just subtracted 2 from each side of the equation, which allowed me to isolate the variable I wanted to solve for. So, I can also try that with this equation 2a - 3b = -23. So, I subtract 2a from each side of the equation, which leaves me with -3b = -23 + 2a. Now, I will try to solve for a. So, I just add 3b to both sides, which leaves me with b = (23 + 2a) / 3. Well, I didn't exactly solve for one of the variables, because now I have a fraction, which is not a single number. But, I can express a as a function of b. There's just a problem here - I still don't know the value of b. But, since a is one less than b, I can just try to solve for a by guessing possible values of b and their successors, and seeing whether they satisfy the equation. Say, I guessed that b is 3, then b + 1 = 4, which works. Then, this was a success, which means that I proved that there are values of a and b such that 2a - 3b = -23. So, b = 4 is a valid solution for the equation. So now, I can just then check if b = 4 really works in the equation. So, I have 2a - 3(b) = 2a",
        " First, we can let $a = x$ and $b = x + 1$ where $x$ is an integer in this case, hence we have $$2x - 3(x + 1) = -23$$ Simplify the equation as follows: $$2x - 3x - 3 = -23$$ Add 3 on both sides of the equation for getting $$- x = - 20$$ Thus we get $x = 20$ and since $a$ and $b$ are consecutive integers with $a<b$, then we know $a = 20$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $20$. I hope it is correct. Let me know if I made any mistake. Thank you for your response. ",

        " To solve this problem, we will use the fact that $a$ and $b$ are consecutive integers, meaning that $b=a+1$.

        " Now, the constraint $a$ and $b$ are consecutive integers means that they can be written as\n\\begin{align*}\na &= b-1\\\\\n&= (b+1)-2 \\\\\n&= -1 + b\n\\end{align*}Also, $a<b$ means that $b+1>1\\Rightarrow b>0$, thus $a>0$.  There are only two cases for the signs of $a$ and $b$:  either $a$ and $b$ are positive, or $a$ and $b$ are negative.Determine, which case is appropriate for the question and solve accordingly.\n#### Case 1: Where both a and b are positive.\nHere, suppose $a = a$ and $b = b$, as there are no other options.  Through substitution,\n\\begin{align*}\n2a-3b &= -23\\\\\n2(b-1)-3b &= -23\\\\\n-2b+2 &= -23\\\\\n-2b &= -25\\\\\nb &= 12.5\n\\end{align*}Thus, the two integers we are looking for are positive, but they cannot be integers, so we should move on to the next case.\n#### Case 2: Where both a and b are negative.\nHere, suppose $a = -a$ and $b = -b$, as there are no other options.  Through substitution,\n\\begin{align*}\n2(-b)+3(-b)&=-23\\\\\n-2b-3b&=-23\\\\\n-5b&=-23\\\\\nb&=\\frac{23}{5}\\\\\nb&=4.6\n\\end{align*}Since $a$ is supposed to be an integer and $b$ is not an integer, we should continue on to the next case as well.\n#### Final Case: There is no such case.\nSince there are no other cases where $a$ and $b$ could satisfy the constraints, the only options available for the problem are $a$ and $b$, and for both cases, there are no integers that fit both conditions, so the problem cannot be solved by only using one case. By using the final case, there is no such case.  For this problem, the solution should be both of the positive and negative cases.\n#### Note: There is a mistake in the Display 1. For the case 1, we should have",
        " First, we are given that $a$ and $b$ are consecutive integers. That means we have $a=b-1$. Now we try to find $b$ using the given information:\n\\begin{align*}\n2a-3b&=-23\\\\\n2(b-1)-3b&=-23\\\\\nb-2-3b&=-23\\\\\n-2b&=-23+2\\\\\nb&=\\frac{-21}{-2}=10.5(\\mathrm{which\\ isn\\'t\\ an\\ integer})\n\\end{align*}\nThis doesn\u2019t make sense. $b$ cannot be a decimal. We know that the numbers are consecutive; so the only possible values of $b$ are $9, 10$ and $11$. So, we try all of them out.\n### Answer: Now we plug in the first values of $b$ into the original equation:12\u20222(b-1) - 3b&=-23\\\\\u2022&=2(9)-3\\cdot9\\\\\u2022&=18-27\\\\\u2022&=-9\\neq-23.  We continue with $b=10$:\u20222(b-1) - 3b&=-23\\\\\u2022&=2(9)-3\\cdot10\\\\\u2022&=18-30\\\\\u2022&=-12\\neq-23.  We continue with $b=11$:\n\u20222(b-1) - 3b&=-23\\\\\u2022&=2(10)-3\\cdot11\\\\\u2022&=20-33\\\\\u2022&=-13\\neq-23.  We can try a few more, or remember that we can also work with $a$ instead of $b$. By the way, we know that $a+1=b$ because they are consecutive integers. So, we have\n\u20222a-3b&=-23\\\\\u2022&=2a-3(a+1)\\\\\u2022&=2a-3a-3\\\\\u2022&=-a-3.  Now we set $-a-3=-23$, then solve for $a$.\n\u2022-a-3&=-23\\\\\u2022&-a=-20\\\\\u2022&a=\\boxed{5}.$a=5$.Final Answer: The final answer is 5. I hope it is correct.",

        " \nSince $a$ and $b$ are consecutive integers, and $a<b$, we can write $b=a+1$. Substituting into $2a-3b = -23$, we get $2a-3(a+1)=-23$. Simplifying the equation yields -a-3=-23, or a=20.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 20. I hope it is correct.  The instructions state that a<b, which implies that if the trial value of a is 20, the corresponding value of b is 21. Substituting these into the equation yields 2(20) - 3(21) = -23.

        " We can first guess what consecutive integers a and b could be. For instance, a could be 1 and b could be 2. If so, we should check if 2(1)-3(2)=-23.\n### What's the result?\n(2)(1) - (3)(2) = 2 - 6 = -4\n### It looks like our original guess was wrong. We should probably try another pair of consecutive integers, such as a = 2 and b = 3.\n### Calculate...\n(2)(2) - (3)(3) = 4 - 9 = -5\n### It still doesn't look right. We could analyze more possibilities, such as a = 3 and b = 4, or even try to figure out a general rule for the patterns of numbers that would work.\n### You could also try to get a general solution for a and b in terms of x, where x is an integer, as follows:\n### 2a - 3b = -23\n### Or you could try to find the smallest pair of consecutive integers that work. So, let's analyze more pairs and finally figure out the solution.\n### For instance, if a = 4, b = 5, then...\n2a - 3b = 2(4) - 3(5) = 8 - 15 = -7\n###  If a = 5, b = 6, then...\n2a - 3b = 2(5) - 3(6) = 10 - 18 = -8\n###  If a = 6, b = 7, then...\n2a - 3b = 2(6) - 3(7) = 12 - 21 = -9\n### So, we can notice that b - a = 1, which means that the difference between b and a is always 1. So, we can write:\n### b - a = 1, a + 1 = b\n### Now, substitute the expression for b into the original equation.\n### 2a - 3(b) = - 23\n### 2a - 3(a + 1) = - 23\n### 2a - 3a - 3 = - 23\n### - a - 3 = - 23\n### a = 20\n### Therefore, the value of a is 20.\n"
