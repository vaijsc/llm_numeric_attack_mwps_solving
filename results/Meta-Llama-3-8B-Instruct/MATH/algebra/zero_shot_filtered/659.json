        " We have to solve this: \\left(\\frac{1}{9}\\right)^x = 3^{x+3}. In order to be able to make progress, let\u2019s get rid of the fractional powers. Note that \\frac{1}{9} = 3^{-2}. This way, \\left(\\frac{1}{9}\\right)^x = \\left(3^{-2}\\right)^x = 3^{-2x}. This allows us to rewrite the equation as: 3^{-2x} = 3^{x+3}. What can you think of now? Please consider how it is usual for two expressions to be equal. You know that they \u201cshould be the same\u201d. In other words, their bases should be the same (exponentially) : 3^{-2x} = 3^{x+3}. That means that the exponents of the bases are the same. So, it must be that -2x=x+3. Now, it is time to solve: $$-2x=x+3$$ $$-3x=3$$ $$x=-1.$$ After we solve for $x$, it means that $x=-1$. Checking our work, we have: $$\\left(\\frac{1}{9}\\right)^{-1}=3^{3-1}=3^2=9,$$and $$3^{-2\\left(-1\\right)}=3^{2}=9.$$Both of these are equal, and they are equal to 9.

        " First, we should isolate the exponential on the left side. But since it has a negative exponent, we need to flip it into a positive one. So, we multiply both sides by $\\frac{1}{1/9} = 9$. This gives $\\boxed{(3)^{-x} = 3^{x+3}}$.\nBy using the principal square root and taking the negative exponent as positive, the equation becomes\n$\\boxed{(3^{x+3})(3^x) = 1}$.\n### Solution:\nTaking the logarithm of both sides, we have $$\\log(3^{x+3}(3^{x})) = \\log(1).$$Using the properties of logarithms, this simplifies to $$(x+3) \\log(3) + x \\log(3) = 0.$$ Since this equation should hold for every possible value of $x$, we let $x = 0$ to obtain \\begin{align*}\n(3)\\log(3)+0\\log(3) &= 0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow 3\\log(3)&=0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\log(3)&=0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow 3&=1,\n\\end{align*}which is a contradiction.\nNow, since $x = 0$ is not a solution to the original equation, we must have $x+3>0$ and therefore $(x+3) \\log(3) > 0$. Thus,\n$$(x+3)\\log(3)+x\\log(3)>0,$$which cancels to\n$$(x+1)\\log(3)>0.$$Since we are assuming that $x$ is real-valued, we know $x+1>0$, which means $\\log(3) > 0$. This implies $3 > 1$, which is true. Therefore, we can multiply both sides of our equation by $$\\frac{-1}{\\log(3)}$$ to obtain\n$$\\frac{(x+3)\\log^2(3)+x\\log^2(3)}{\\log^2(3)}>0,$$which simplifies to\n$$x\\log(3) > -3\\log(3).$$Since we know $\\log(3) > 0$, we obtain\n$$x > \\boxed{-3}.$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -3.

We can do this by combining the $x$ terms:\n$$x(-2\\log(3)) = x\\log(3) + 3\\log(3)$$\n$$\\to -2x\\log(3) = x\\log(3) + 3\\log(3)$$\n$$\\to -2x\\log(3) - 3\\log(3) = x\\log(3)$$\n$$\\to -2x\\log(3) - 3\\log(3) - x\\log(3) = 0$$\n$$\\to (-2x-3-x)\\log(3) = 0$$\nWe can now see that we can factor out the $\\log(3)$ from the equation. When we do this, we can see that the equation becomes:\n$$(-3-x)\\log(3) = 0$$\nNow, we can solve the equation for $x$. We will set each factor equal to zero and solve for $x$. We obtain:\n$$-3 = 0\\quad\\text{or}\\quad -x = 0$$\nSolving for $x$ yields the two solutions: $x",

I hope it is correct. ### Explanation of the solution\nThe base of the equation is 1/9, which can be written as 1 divided by the base 9. Multiplying both numerator and denominator of this by 3, we have $$\\left(\\frac{1}{9}\\right)^x = 3^{-2x}.$$ Simplifying the right hand side gives $$3^{x+3}=3^{x+3}.$$ Equating the exponents, we get $$-2x=x+3,$$ that is, $$x(-2-1)=3,$$ or $$-3x=3,$$ which finally yields $$x=\\boxed{-1}.$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -1.

I hope it is correct. Final Answer: The final answer is -1. I hope it is correct.  I apologize, my solution is incorrect. The correct solution is as follows: First note that $3^{x+3}=3^{x}3^{3}$. Now, the equation becomes: $$\\left(\\frac{1}{9}\\right)^x = 3^{x}3^{3}.$$ In order to make both sides have the same base, we can rewrite left side as follows: $$\\left(\\frac{1}{9}\\right)^x = (3^{-2})^x = 3^{-2x}.$$ Comparing both sides the expression, we get: $$3^{-2x} = 3^{x}3^{3}.$$ If we take the logarithm of both sides and divide by -2x, we can simplify the equation. $$-2x = x+3$$ $$-3x = 3$$ $$x = \\boxed{-1",
        " \nWe could try the logarithmic form. Taking the logarithm on both sides gives\n$$x\\log\\left(\\frac{1}{9}\\right)=x+3\\log 3\\Rightarrow\\log\\left(\\frac{1}{9}\\right)=\\log 3.$$Now, applying the properties of logarithms, we have\n$$\\frac{\\log 1-\\log 9}{\\log 9}=\\log 3\\Rightarrow\\log 9+3\\log 3=0\\Rightarrow\\log 3^{-4}=0\\Rightarrow3^{-4}=1.$$This implies that $x=4$.\nAnother way is to make both sides into a common base. Simplifying both sides, we obtain\n$$\\left(\\frac{1}{3^2}\\right)^x=3^{x+3}\\Rightarrow\\left(3^{-2}\\right)^x=3^{x+3}.$$Using the power rule, we get\n$$3^{-2x}=3^{x+3}\\Rightarrow-2x=x+3\\Rightarrow-x=5,$$and solving for $x$ yields\n$$x=\\boxed{-5}.$$\n### Note: Solve for $x$: $$\\left(\\frac{1}{9}\\right)^x = 3^{x+3}.$$\nSolution: \\begin{align*}\n&\\left(\\frac{1}{9}\\right)^x = 3^{x+3}\\\\\n&\\Rightarrow\\quad\\frac{1}{9^x}=3^{x+3}\\\\\n&\\Rightarrow\\quad 9^{-x}=3^{x+3}\\\\\n&\\Rightarrow\\quad 3^{-2x}=3^{x+3}\\\\\n&\\Rightarrow\\quad -2x=x+3\\\\\n&\\Rightarrow\\quad -x=5\\\\\n&\\Rightarrow\\quad x=\\boxed{-5}\n\\end{align*}\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -5.

        " The given equation is $\\left(\\frac{1}{9}\\right)^x = 3^{x+3}$.\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by $\\frac{1}{3^3}$, we obtain\n$$\\frac{1}{3^{2x+3}} = \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^x.$$\nNow, using the property that $a^x = b^x$ if and only if $a=b$, we have\n$$3^{2x+3}=3^x \\Rightarrow 2x+3=x \\Rightarrow x = -3.$$\nNow we need to verify if $x=-3$ is a solution.\nPlugging in $x=-3$ in the original equation, we get\n$$\\left(\\frac{1}{9}\\right)^{-3}=3^{(-3)+3}\\Rightarrow \\frac{1}{1/27}=1 \\Rightarrow \\frac{1}{9}=1 \\Rightarrow 1=\\frac{1}{9}.$$\nBut clearly, $1=\\frac{1}{9}$ is not true. Therefore, $x = -3$ is not the solution to the given equation.\nThis is unusual because we do not usually have a false solution when we solve for $x$.\nFrom here, we should not follow any technique but we should start again and begin to play with the given equation like in the beginning. We need to keep in mind that there may not be a solution, and it could be a clue.\nLet\u2019s analyze the given equation. $$\\left(\\frac{1}{9}\\right)^x = 3^{x+3}.$$\nThe given equation consists of two expressions with bases that are different.\nThe base of the left hand side expression $\\frac{1}{9}$ is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\nThe base of the right hand side expression $3$ is itself.\nIn the right-hand side expression, the base is multiplied by a power of $x$.

        " First, we need to rewrite the right-hand side of the given equation.  We know that $3^a=3^{b}$ if and only if $a=b$, and we know that if we have any $c$, we may rewrite $3^c$ as $3^{c\\log_3(3)}$.  Given these facts, we know that since $$3^{x+3}=3^x\\cdot 3^3=3^x\\cdot 27=3^x\\cdot 3^{3\\log_3(3)}=3^{x+\\log_3(27)}=3^{x+\\log_3(3^3)}\\Rightarrow$$ 3^{x+3}=3^{x+\\log_3(3^3)}=3^{x+3\\log_3(3)}=3^{x+3\\log_3(3)}.$$Now, we know that $$9=3^2\\Rightarrow 3^3=3^{2\\log_3(3)}=3^{2\\cdot 1}.$$Therefore, we know that \\begin{align*}\n3^{x+3}&=3^{x+\\log_3(3^3)}\\\\\n&=3^{x+3\\log_3(3)}\\\\\n&=3^{x+3\\cdot 1}\\\\\n&=3^{x+2\\log_3(3^1)}\\\\\n&=(3^{\\log_3(3^1)})^{x+2}\\\\\n&=(3)^{(x+2)}\\\\\n&=3^{x+2}\n\\end{align*}So, we know that $\\left(\\frac{1}{9}\\right)^x = 3^{x+3}=\\boxed{3^{x+2}}.$Also, we know that for any nonzero $a$ and $b$, we have $$\\left(\\frac{a}{b}\\right)^x = \\frac{a^x}{b^x},$$and so, we may rewrite the left-hand side of our given equation as $$\\left(\\frac{1}{9}\\right)^x=\\frac{1^x}{9^x}=\\frac{1}{3^{2x}}=\\frac{3^{-2x}}{1}$$and arrive at the following:$$\\frac{3^{-2x}}{1}=3^{x",
        " \nLet\u2019s think step by step.\nSince we have a fraction on the left-hand side, we can get rid of the denominator by rewriting it as an equivalent expression:\n$$\\left(\\frac{1}{9}\\right)^{\\!\\!x} = \\left(\\frac{1}{3^2}\\right)^{\\!\\!x}.$$Now, we note that $3^{-x}$ is an equivalent expression to $(1/3)^x$. Therefore,\n$$\\left(\\frac{1}{3^2}\\right)^{\\!\\!x}=\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^{\\!\\!2x}.$$If we raise both sides of the original equation to the power of $(x+3)$, we obtain\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\left(\\frac{1}{3^2}\\right)^{\\!\\!x} = 3^{x+3}\\\\\n&\\Rightarrow\\qquad \\left[\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^{\\!\\!2x}\\right]^{x+3} = \\left(3^{x+3}\\right)^{x+3}\\\\\n&\\Rightarrow\\qquad \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^{\\!\\!2x(x+3)} = 3^{\\left[(x+3)\\right]^2}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^{\\!\\!2x(x+3)} &= 3^{x^2+6x+9}.\\end{align*}Now, we can recognize the bases on both sides of the equation: the base $\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^{\\!\\!1}$ corresponds to $\\frac{1}{3}$, while the base $3^{\\!1}$ corresponds to $3$. Therefore, the bases are the same, and we equate the exponents to obtain the equation\n$$2x(x+3) = x^2+6x+9.$$\nWe can factor the left-hand side of this equation as follows:\n$$2\\cdot x\\cdot (x+3) = 2x(x+3) = x(x+2+3) = x(x+5).$$Thus, we have\n$$x(x+5) = x^2+6x+9.$$Subtracting $x^2$ and subtracting $6x$ from both sides, we have\n$$x",
