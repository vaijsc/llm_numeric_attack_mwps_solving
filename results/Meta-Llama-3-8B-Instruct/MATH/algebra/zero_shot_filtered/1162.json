I hope it is correct. ### Solution steps: 1. Simplify the numerator. $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 1024 = 512$. 2. Simplify the denominator. First, convert $0.125$ to a fraction and divide each part by $2^{12}$. $\\frac{1}{125} = \\frac{0.125 \\times 2^{12}}{0.125 \\times 2^{12}}$. 3.

In this step, we convert $0.0015625$ to a fraction to facilitate the division. We multiply $0.0015625$ by $64$ to get $0.100$. Another way is dividing $0.0015625$ by $64$ to get $\\boxed{40960}$. ### Conclusion:\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 40960. I hope it is correct. Just thought it may help to show detailed steps that the solution goes through. It adds extra confidence. Thanks for your response! ### Verification: 512 / $\\displaystyle \\frac{125}{8\\times 2^{11}} = 512 \\times \\frac{8\\times 2^{11}}{125} = 4096\\times2^{10} = 40960$.
