        " \nAnother way to solve this problem is to use the property that (a+b)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + 2ab. This can help in splitting the problem of squaring a large number in smaller parts. For instance, \n9997^2 = (10000 - 3)^2.\nSo we can compute this using the expansion given above:\n9997^2\n= (10000 - 3)^2\n= 10000^2 - 2*10000*3 + 3^2\n= 10000000 - 60000 + 9\n= 9940009.\nThis method of breaking the problem into smaller parts simplifies the problem and it's always helpful to reduce the magnitude of the numbers that are being manipulated.",
        " $$9997^2 = (10000-3)^2 = 10000^2 - 2(10000)3 + 3^2$$ $$= 1,000,000 - 60,000 + 9$$ $$= 940,009$$",
        " \nWe can start by thinking about the hundreds digit, which is 9. The square of 9 is 81.\nNow, let\u2019s think about the tens digit, which is 9 as well. The square of 9 is 81 again.\nFinally, let\u2019s think about the ones digit, which is 7. The square of 7 is 49.\nSo, if we multiply the squares of each digit together (81 * 81 * 49 = ?), we get our final answer.\nLet\u2019s calculate:\n81 * 81 = 6561 ( squared hundreds digits)\n6561 * 49 = 321369 (answer) \nTherefore, the square of 9997 is 321369.\nNote: The reason we can think about each digit separately is because the multiplication operation is associative and distributive, meaning we can perform the multiplication in any order and still get the same answer. This makes it easier to calculate larger numbers without a calculator. \n### More Discussion:\nTo take it a step further, this problem also involves understanding some properties of multiplication, such as:\n1. **Commutative Property**: The order in which we multiply the digits doesn't change the result. For example, we could multiply the hundreds and tens digits first (81 * 81), and then multiply the result with the ones digit (6561 * 49).\n2. **Associative Property**: We can group the digits in any way we want and still get the same result. For example, we could group the hundreds and tens digits together (81) and then multiply that with the ones digit (81 * 49).\n3. **Distributive Property**: We can \"distribute\" the multiplication over the addition of the digits. For example, we could split the multiplication into two parts: the product of the hundreds and tens digits (81 * 9), and the product of the tens and ones digits (81 * 7), and then add them together.\nThese properties help us simplify complex multiplication problems by allowing us to break them down into smaller, more manageable parts. When working with larger numbers, understanding these properties is crucial for calculating the correct result. \n### Additional Notes:\n1. This problem also demonstrates the **carry-over** concept, where we need to carry the result of the multiplication of the two most significant digits (9997 * 99) to the hundreds place when calculating the square of 9997.\n2. For larger numbers, algebraic manipulation can help simplify the calculation. For example,",

        " 99560009\nLet's see. First, we'll find the digits of the square of 9997.\nFirst, 10000 squared (since 9997 is just a few digits away from 10000) is 100000000. Now, subtract 100000000 from 9997 squared to find the correct answer.\n9997 squared is 99890009, and subtracting that from 100000000 yields\n100000000 - 99890009 = 99560009.\nSo, the square of 9997 is indeed 99560009!\nPlease note that we can also do this calculation mentally by assuming 9997 is 10000, subtracting the additional 3, and dividing the result by 10000, since the hundreds place has no effect on the result. \nFurther, when calculating the tens place, we note that the tens place of 99 is the same as the tens place of 9997, so we can use 99 as a quick mental check to figure out the square of the number in the tens place.\nThis process continues for the ones place calculation as well, making it easier to calculate the square mentally. \nAlternatively, you can also use the trick for getting the square of a number by adding the digits of a number 8 times:\n9997 + 7 = 10004\n10004 + 7 = 10011\n10011 + 7 = 10018\n10018 + 7 = 10025\n10025 + 7 = 10032\n10032 + 7 = 10039\n10039 + 7 = 10046\n10046 + 7 = 9953\nThe last digit again will be 7, so we get 99560009.\nThough, the above method is more of a memorization trick and an easy way to calculate the square mentally, the step-by-step method explained in the first part is indeed the most precise way to calculate it.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 99560009.
