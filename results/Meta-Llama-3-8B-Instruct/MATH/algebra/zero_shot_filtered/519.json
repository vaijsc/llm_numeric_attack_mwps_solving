Mapping the equation $n^2 = 1,\\!000,\\!000$ to $\\log$, $2\\log n = \\log (2^6 * 5^6) \\Rightarrow \\log n = 6 + 6 \\log 5 \\Rightarrow n = 5 * e^{6 \\log 5}.$ And we can easily verify that $n = 5 * 1000$. $n^3 = 125\u2019000\u2019000$. Map the equation to logarithmic base: $\\log n^3 = \\log 125\u2019000\u2019000 \\Rightarrow 3\\log n = \\log 125\u2019000\u2019000 \\Rightarrow \\log n = \\frac{\\log 125\u2019000\u2019000}{3} \\Rightarrow n = e^{\\frac{\\log 125\u2019000\u2019000}{3}}$.

There's a mistake here because we should not take the cube root twice but use it once. Once the cube root is applied, the third root won't take any effect because the expression is in form $\\sqrt[\\leftroot{-3}]{\\leftroot{-2} \\leftroot{-1}{\\leftroot{0}{a^m}}^{\\leftroot{3} n} \\right)}$, where m is 2 and n is 1, then m is 3 and n is 1, then m is 1. In this case we have 2, 3, 1, 1. When we rewrite 1,000,000, it is easy to see the value of the cube root and the square root, so it becomes as we calculated. Finally we take 1000 minus the value of the cube root and get our answer, 900.\n@alt = A Math Problem.jpg@size = 170@alt = A Math Problem\nhttp://problemoftheweek.winchestermath.com/index.php?student=&page=mop&section=previous&previous=mop1&ret=showolve\nI hope this helps and makes it easy, don't worry!

        " To evaluate $\\sqrt{1,\\!000,\\!000} - \\sqrt[3]{1,\\!000,\\!000}$, first, we obtain $\\sqrt{1,\\!000,\\!000}$. To do this, we write it as $\\sqrt{10^6}$. Next, we know that $\\sqrt{10^x} = 10^{x/2}$ for any real number $x.$ So, $\\sqrt{10^6} = 10^{6/2} = 10^3 = 1,\\!000$. Therefore, we have $\\sqrt{1,\\!000,\\!000} = \\boxed{1,\\!000}$. Next, we determine $\\sqrt[3]{1,\\!000,\\!000}.$ To do this, we rewrite it as $\\sqrt[3]{10^6} = 10^{6/3} = 10^2 = 100.$ Thus, we have $\\sqrt[3]{1,\\!000,\\!000} = 100.$ Finally, we have our desired result as the difference:\n$$\\sqrt{1,\\!000,\\!000} - \\sqrt[3]{1,\\!000,\\!000} = 1,\\!000 - 100 = \\boxed{900}.$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 900.

For more complex mathematic questions, visit us at our contact page.\nThe idea is to recognize that taking a cube root or a square root of a number will always result in a non-negative value (since $x^2$ and $x^3$ are always positive).\nThen it's just a matter of factoring out a common value (100 in this case) and subtracting out the parts that are cubed or squared (1 x 100 is 100, not 0 when subtracting).\nLastly, you're left with the remaining non-negative value of 900. The key here is to recognize the two different square and cube root operations and to subtract 1000 from 100 in the simplest way (just subtract since both are positive).\nThis problem is good because it shows that 1,000,000 is the product of two perfect squares (1000*1000) and a perfect cube (100*100*100), and so it is easily divisible by these values. \nFinal Answer: The final answer is 900.

First, you need to find the prime factorization of 1,000,000. Prime numbers less than 100,000 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 The prime factorization of 1,000,000 is 10^6. 10^6 = 10 * 10 * 10 * 10 * 10. The cube of any number from 1 to 9 is less than 1000, so it is clear that 1000 is not a perfect cube. To find the value of square root of 1,000,000, you need to multiply 1000 and 1000. You get 1,000,000. So, the value of square root of 1,000,000 is 1000. To find the value of cube root of 1,000,000, you need to find the number that when it is raised to the power of 3 is equal to 1,000,000. You need to find the number from 1 to 9. The third power of 100 is less than 1000, so it is clear that 100 is not a perfect cube. The third power of 200 is less than 8000, so it is clear that 200 is not a perfect cube. The third power of 300 is less than 27,000, so it is clear that 300 is not a perfect cube",

Since $10^3 < 1000 < 10^4$, we must have that $\\sqrt[6]{1000} - 1$ is an integer divisible by 2, 5, and 2 (since we can rewrite 1000 as $(2^3)(5)^2$), or $10$.  So the units digit of $\\sqrt[6]{1000} - 1$ must be 0.

        " \nLet $n=\\sqrt{1,\\!000,\\!000}$. Then $n^2 = 1,\\!000,\\!000$. Therefore, $n^2 = 10^6$. This implies that $n$ must be an integer. By guess and check, we find that $n=1000$. So, the expression evaluates to $$\\sqrt{1,\\!000,\\!000} - \\sqrt[3]{1,\\!000,\\!000} = 1000 - 1000 = \\boxed{0}.$$ Therefore, our final answer is $0$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 0.

Using a calculator, we can see that $$\\sqrt{1,000,000} \\approx 1000.0000$$and$$\\sqrt[3]{1,000,000} \\approx 1000.000.$$ Let $$n = \\sqrt{1,000,000} - \\sqrt[3]{1,000,000}.$$ This means that$$n^3 = \\left( \\sqrt{1,000,000} - \\sqrt[3]{1,000,000} \\right)^3 = 1,000,000 - 3 \\cdot 1,000,000 \\sqrt{1,000,000} + 3 \\cdot (1000.000)^2 \\sqrt[3]{1,000,000} - (1000.000)^3.$$ Since there is a square root inside a cube root, we can simplify$$n^3 = 1,000,000 - 3000,000,xxx + 3,000,000,000 - 1,000,000,000.$$ Simplifying again yields$$n^3 = -3000,000,000.$$ Since each term in the expression is divisible by 1000, the units digit is 8. Since $$m = -3000,000,000,$$ we can divide that out by 1000 to obtain the $n$$-the final answer is -3000.$$So that is the work of the calculator method, Final Answer: The final answer is 0.
