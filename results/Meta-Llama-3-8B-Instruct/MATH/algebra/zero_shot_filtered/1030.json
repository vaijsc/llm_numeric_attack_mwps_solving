        " Let\u2019s evaluate $g(1)$ first.\nBy the definition of $g(x)$, $g(1)=1-1=0$.  Now evaluate $f(0)$: $f(0)=0^3+2\\cdot0+1=1$.  So, $f(g(1))=f(0)=\\boxed{1}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 1. I hope it is correct.  To find the value of $f(g(1))$, we can substitute 1 into the function $g(x)$ and simplify. Then, we can substitute the value of $g(1)$ into the function $f(x)$ and simplify again. All these can be done in a different step-counting way. Interesting examples like these will require us to apply evaluation to two separate functions, requiring to go in different orders and respecting all steps. Whether we go step-by-step, from around back and forth, back and forth we should start by evaluating $g(1)$ and then evaluate $f(g(1)).$$This is another adaptive result of our general methods we go through easiest in all studies.\nThat is you like a bit summary from here.\nPlease tell us what else related.

        " Since $g(1)=1-1=0$, we have $f(g(1))=f(0)=0^3+2(0)+1=1$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 1. I hope it is correct. ### Explanation: The problem states that we need to compute $f(g(1))$, where $f$ is the function $f(x)=x^3+2x+1$ and $g$ is the function $g(x)=x-1$. The strategy here is to first evaluate $g(1)$, and then plug this result into $f$ to get the final answer. To evaluate $g(1)$, we substitute $x=1$ into the definition of $g$, yielding $g(1)=1-1=0$. Therefore, we have $f(g(1))=f(0)$. To evaluate $f(0)$, we substitute $x=0$ into the definition of $f$, yielding $f(0)=0^3+2(0)+1=1$. Therefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{f(g(1))=1}$. An alternative approach would be to directly compute $f(g(1))$ without evaluating $g(1)$ first: \\begin{align*}\nf(g(1))&=f(1-1)\\\\\n&=f(0)\\\\\n&=0^3+2(0)+1\\\\\n&=1,\n\\end{align*}which yields the same final answer. This approach may be useful for more complex functions or when the computation involves multiple steps. However, in this case, the step-by-step approach with direct evaluation is more straightforward and easier to follow. Is there something specific you would like me to clarify?

It looks like you're trying to solve a problem where you need to find the value of $f(g(1))$, where $f(x)=x^3+2x+1$ and $g(x)=x-1$. Let's break it down step by step, shall we?\nFirst, we need to find $g(1)$. To do this, we simply plug in $x=1$ into the function $g(x)$: $g(1)=1-1=0$. So, $g(1)=0$.\nNow that we have $g(1)$, we can plug it back into the function $f(x)$ to find $f(g(1))$: $$f(g(1))=f(0)=0^3+2\\cdot0+1=0+0+1=\\boxed{1}$$\nThere you have it! The answer to $f(g(1))$ is $1$. If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!",
