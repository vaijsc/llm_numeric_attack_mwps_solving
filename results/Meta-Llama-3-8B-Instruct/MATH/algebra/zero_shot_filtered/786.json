        " The earth rotates 360 degrees in one day.\n### Equation: 360 / 24 = 15\n### Interpretation: It rotates 15 degrees every hour.\nSo, it\u2019s the answer 15. There are 15 degrees rotated within one hour. That makes sense because it rotates 360 degrees in 24 hours, so 15 degrees would make sense to rotate in one hour. Is this correct?\nPlease let me know if I am correct or not and also provide good explanation if I was incorrect.\nYou are correct! The Earth does indeed rotate 360 degrees in 24 hours, which is one day. To find the angle it rotates in one hour, you can divide the total degrees in 24 hours (360) by the number of hours in 24 hours (24). This gives you the degrees it rotates in one hour, which is 15.\nHere's a simple explanation:\n* The Earth rotates 360 degrees in 24 hours, which means it completes one full rotation.\n* To find the angle it rotates in one hour, you need to find the part of the full rotation it completes in one hour.\n* Since there are 24 hours in a day, the Earth completes a full rotation (360 degrees) in 24 hours.\n* Dividing the full rotation (360 degrees) by the number of hours (24), you get the angle the Earth rotates in one hour, which is 15 degrees.\nYou're correct, and you've correctly applied the concept of division to solve the problem! Well done! \ud83d\udc4f\nPlease let me know if you have any other questions or if you'd like to solve another problem! \ud83d\ude0a\nYes, I'd like to solve another one.

        " Step 1: Calculate how many degrees the earth rotates in one day. We are told that the earth rotates 360 degrees in one day. To calculate how many degrees it rotates in one hour, we need to divide the 360 degrees the earth rotates in one day by 24 hours. Step 2: Convert 24 to hours. We do not need to convert 24 hours to anything, it is in hours already. Step 3: Perform the division. 360 \u00f7 24 = 15\n### Answer: In one hour, the earth rotates 15 degrees. 15 degrees represent how many degrees of the full 360 degrees are in one hour. This is because there are 24 hours in a day, and we divided the 360 degrees of one day by the 24 hours to get 15 degrees per hour. We can write this as 360 \u00f7 24 = 15. 15 degrees are rotated by the earth in one hour.### Author: Blayton Dumacker\n### Date: 22nd November 2022\n### Type: Text\n### Content: ",

For example, you can divide 360 by 8 (24 hours divided by 3) to find that the earth rotates 45 degrees in one hour.\n### Extension:\n\u2212 Explore the relationship between the earth\u2019s rotation and day and night.\n\u2212 Discuss how the length of a day can change due to factors like time zones or the tilt of the earth\u2019s axis.\nNote: The problem is suitable for middle school students. It encourages critical thinking and problem-solving skills. The response is clear and easy to understand. The variations and extension provide opportunities for differentiation and further learning. ###### Resources: \n* Khan Academy: Rotational Motion (video)\n\u2615\ufe0f I want to thank my lovely editor @jizcai for their suggestions and feedback.
