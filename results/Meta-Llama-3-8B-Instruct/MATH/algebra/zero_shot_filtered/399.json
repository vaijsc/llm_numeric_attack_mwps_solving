There are no special marks. Hence, my answer is correct. Hope it helps! So, is there anything else I need to help you with? READ Carefully Carefully READ I WILL ALWAYS HELP IF YOU HAVE SOME PROMPT - EMAIL ME!\nWhat are the chances it would occur if I didn't even check my answer?'' ...I don't think the answer is correct. It's basically asking you to evaluate $D(2,4,6)$. $(2+4+6)$ equals $12$ and you can just multiply those constant $2$, $4$, and $6$ to get $48$, then divide by $12$ to get $4$. Therefore, I agree with the answer. Although, I did not understand the prompt. It seemed like I had to find $D(a,b,c)$ and somehow had to plug in $2,4,6$, it seemed like the whole point was just to plug in $a$, $b$, $c$! Is the question written correctly? If I did not catch that by step by step protocol, my chances of getting it wrong could be $100$%! and then I realized the prompt was different. It was asking for a specific expression, for a given value. It was just an application of the formula. It was not a set it in front of you, it was just a simple math problem.''\nI was wrong initially, it was not checking using the protocol, it was reading the prompt incorrectly. I was misdirecting myself because my mind refused to accept that the question was simply an application of the formula. Lastly, the prompt did not seem right because it always seems to follow the pattern in other questions that they ask you to find the general expression for a function and then plug in the values. This question did not follow that pattern. Best regards\nFinal Answer: The final answer is indeed 4. I hope it is correct. I will make sure to read the prompt carefully in the future. I will always be open to corrections and I never stop improving my approach to answering questions. Thank you for helping me improve! Read carefully before assuming! Read carefully before jumping",
        " First, we are given a formula \\[D(a,b,c)=\\frac{abc}{a+b+c}.\\]Then, we want to find the value of $\\text{{D}}(2,4,6)$. So we apply the formula to find $$D(2,4,6)=\\frac{(2)(4)(6)}{2+4+6}=\\frac{48}{12}=\\boxed{4}.$$Happy solving!",

I hope it is correct. ### Point of Discussion: The question marker seems to have put a lot of emphasis on emphasizing that the numbers are nonzero. But that\u2019s because they decided to add a weirdly specific line in the problem, which wasn\u2019t really necessary for this to make sense. It\u2019s like the question maker is trying to say, \u201cHey, pay attention! These are nonzero numbers, okay? Don\u2019t do anything weird!\u201d But like, we wouldn\u2019t have done anything weird in the first place. The numbers are just being inputs, and we happen to use them in the given formula. If the question maker had written it in a normal way, without all the extra nonsense, it would have been just fine. But no, the question maker had to go and be all extra. Anyway, I guess it\u2019s all good now. We have our answer, and we can all appreciate the beauty of the formula D(a, b, c) = abc / (a + b + c).amu4533 E PuT 2023/2/26 23:45  $\"Request failed!\" Why not try a different web browser or device?
