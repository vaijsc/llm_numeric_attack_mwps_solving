Let me know if you have any questions.  I cannot give you the simplest answer possible. That would be too easy. You need a math expert to give you an answer, so you need to be here. I hope my answer helped you. This problem is too easy, but being easy does not mean it is not important. We must think carefully about this problem. We must think geometrically in order to have the best answer. With $c = \\frac{13}{4},$ we have the equation $y = ax^2+ax+\\frac{13}{4}$, which can be written as $(4ax+a) x^2+ ax + \\frac{13}{4}$. This means that the polynomial is equal to the product of the linear and the $(2x-1)$, so that $4a = 2a \\cdot (2x-1) + 1 \\cdot (2x-1)^2$, so that the second degree coefficient is the square of an integer, and the first degree coefficient is $\\frac{1}{2}$ times the product of the two numbers, so the linear part is $\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{c_2^",
        " Our base equation, relating $f(x)$ to $y$, is:\n$$f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$$\n### Property of Solution Paths:\nPlot steps in of the $x$-coordinate are continued in an interval until we reached the $y$-axis, giving us an equation to approximate. At each of the locations, the y and x get split evenly between the two closest points of y-coordinate.\n### How keypoints for equation?\n; Determine P1 point. Taking x approaches 0 and this is: $$y = f(0) = c$$ Y is on c-axis }\n### The points Equation Determine 2'; So, we need 3 points: First: $$f(0) = c$$ Second:, Since we use one degree trigonometry,\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d} x} (f(x) ) = 0 \\implies 4x + b = 0 \\implies x = -\\frac{b}{4}$$ # The third point. When $x = -\\frac{b}{4}$ $$y = \\frac{-b^2}{16} + c$$ It's the point (b/4, (b2)/16 + c). 0 y will be: $c = \\left(0\\right),$ then $c = 1$, and $x = -\\frac{b}{4} = 0 = \\frac{-b}{4}$\n$$b = 0$$ When the new $y$ value is given, we can use given $x = -\\frac{-b}{4} = 0 = \\frac{-b}{4},$ then $b = 0$.\n### The Second Equation: The second level: $x = 2$\nUsing the slope $$f'(x) = -4x + b = 0$$\n$$x = \\frac{b}{4}$$ $$y = c + f'(x)$$ $$y = c$$ This means the 3rd level $$x = 2,$$\n$$y = 7$$ $$y = c$$\n$$c = 7$$\n### Final Decision\n$$a = \\boxed{-2}$$ $$b = \\boxed{0}$$ $$c = \\boxed{7}$$ $$a + b + c = -2 + 0 + 7 = \\boxed{5}$$ Therefore, we conclude with 5",
        " \nLet the axis of symmetry be $x=P$.  Then the vertex is $V(P, f(P))$.  By quadratic formula $$P=\\frac{-b}{2a}=\\frac{-4}{-4}=1.$$  So the vertex is $(1,1)$.  Using the intercepts $f(0)=1$ and $f(-2)=5$ we can write an equation: $$\\begin{gather*} f(x)=ax^2+bx+c \\\\ 1 = c \\\\ 5 = 4a-4+b+c=4a+b+1 \\\\ 5 = 4a+b \\end{gather*}$$ Plugging in $x=0$ gives us that $c=1$.  Plugging in $x=-2$ and multiplying by 4 on both sides we get $20 = 4a+b$, and subtracting 4 from each side we get $16=4a$, which gives us that $a=4$.  Plugging back in gives us $16=4a+b$, which gives us that $b=-12$.  Plugging in values again we get $8+(-12)+1=-ax+b+c=0$, so $a=-8$.  Adding all the values up gives $\\boxed{a+b+c=-8-12+1=\\boxed{-19}}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -19. I hope it is correct. ",
        "  Let\u2019s try to find out the function given the graph. For our function, we know that it goes through points $(-1, 0)$ and $(1, 1)$. Therefore, we can write an equation: $$a(-1)^2+b(-1)+c=0$$$$a-b+c=0$$ Plugging in our $x$ value of $1$ and $y$ value of $1$ into the function equation, we get the following:\n$$a(1)^2+b(1)+c=1$$$$a+b+c=1$$\nWe have $a-b+c=0$. Therefore, $c=b-a$. Plugging this value into the second equation, $a+b+c=1$, we get $$a+b+(b-a)=1$$$$2b=a+1$$ We know that $a, b$ and $c$ are integers. We can see that there\u2019s only one set of positive integers that solve this equation. Therefore, we have $a=1, b=2,$ and $c=1$. Therefore, $a+b+c=\\boxed{4}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 4.

        " I know that I need to solve for $a$, $b$, and $c$, which means I need the vertex of the function and the function\u2019s information about y-intercept and axis of symmetry.\n#### Find $c$ using the $y$-intercept\nBy using the equation of a function in vertex form, $f(x) = a(x-h)^2+k$, we have the vertex of the function at $(h,k)$, which in this case is $(1,1)$.  We can simply plug in 1 for $x$ and find $k$:\n$$f(1) = a(1-h)^2+k = a+k = 1.$$ Therefore, $k = 1 \u2013 a.$\nNow, we can just substitute back $x=0$ into the original equation, which means we get the $y$-intercept of $f(0)=c$:\n$$c = a(0)^2+b(0)+1 = 1.$$ We have our answer for $c$ which is 1.\n#### Find $a$ using the graph\nThe equation of a parabola opens upward when $a$ is positive and downward when $a$ is negative.  From the graph, we see that the parabola opens downward, which means that $a$ is negative.  We can find $a$ by calculating the distance between the vertex and the axis of symmetry, which is the coefficient of the $x^2$ term squared.  By subtracting the vertex, 1, from the point at the lowest point on the graph, which we can place at $y=-2$, we get the distance $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$.  Squaring it, we get $\\boxed{a = -\\frac{1}{2}}$.\n#### Find $b$ by using $b=\\frac{-\\text{vertical shift}}{\\text{horizontal shift}}$\nFrom previous steps, we know that we have the vertex of the function at $(1,1)$.  To find $b$, we notice that the distance from $(1,1)$ to the lowest point on the graph (that we placed at $y=-2$) is the vertical shift of $\\frac{3}{2}$.  The horizontal shift is $1$.  Therefore, $b=\\boxed{\\frac{-3}{2}}$.\n#### Final Answer:\nNow that we have the values for $a$, $b$,",

The parabola crosses this line at $x=1$ with value $1$. Therefore we know that the vertex form is $y=a(x-1)^2+1$ and since $f(-1)=0$ we get $a=-2$.\nThus, the parabola becomes $y=-2(x-1)^2+1$.\nAfter some algebraic manipulations we get $y=-2x^2+4x-1$.

        " In order to get the vertex, we need to find where the graph is touching its minimum point (y = $-c/a$, x = $-b/2a$).  The vertex of that point is at $(1,-1)$.\nThen we have $-c/a = -1$, so $c = a$ and $-b/2a = 1$ .  Then $b = -2a$.\nFinally we see $y = -2x^2+4x+1$, so $a = -2$, $b=4$, and $c=1$.

        " We find the interception points of $y$ with the x axis.  There are two intercept, namely $(0,1)$ and $(-\\frac{1}{2},0)$.  This tells us that \\begin{align*}\nc&=1,\\\\\n-\\frac{b}{2}+c&=0,\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad b&=2.\n\\end{align*}To find $a$, we can find the vertex of the parabola.  The formula for the vertex is given by\n$$(h,k)=\\left(-\\frac{b}{2a},f\\left(-\\frac{b}{2a}\\right)\\right).$$For this particular graph, we can see that the vertex is $(-\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{3}{2})$.  Hence, \\begin{align*}\n-\\frac{b}{2a}&=-\\frac{1}{2},\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad a&=\\frac{1}{4},\\\\\nf\\left(-\\frac{b}{2a}\\right)&=\\frac{3}{2}.\n\\end{align*}Taking into account the fact that $f\\left(x\\right)=-2x^2+4x+1$, we can solve for $a$ and obtain that $a=\\frac{1}{2}$.

        " Since the graph is a parabola with a maximum point, it must be a \u201cy = ax^2 + by + c\u201d where a, b, and c are integers. Since the two roots of x in the vertex, it must have an equation form:  (x - (-1)) = 1\u22c52(x + 1) = 2x + 2. Where the maximum point is (1,3). And by the formula, f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c we get : 3 = a\u22c5 1^2 + b \u22c5 1+ c. 3 = a + b + c. And since f(0) = 1, we have: 1 = a\u22c5 0^2 + b\u22c5 0 + c. 1 = c. Finally, setting the vertex to x = 1 as follows: 3 = a\u22c5 1^2 + b \u22c5 1+ 1. 3 = a + b + 2. So: a + b + c = 3, a + b + 1 = 3 And solving the system, we find: a = 0, b = 3, c = 1. So a+b+c = 0+3+1 = 4, Final Answer: The final answer is 4. I hope it is correct.",
        " My solution is:\nThe graph is upside down.  It is a downward-opening parabola.  Therefore, its quadratic function begins with $-a$.  We are only interested in $a$, $b$, and $c$, so we disregard the positive $x$-axis and consider a downward-opening parabola, which has its vertex at $(x,y)=(1/2,1+2a)$.  At $x=0$, the function is $c$, and at $x=1$ it is $1+2a-b+a=c$.\nEvaluated at $x=0$, $-a+c=1$, so $c=1+a$.\nEvaluated at $x=1$, we have $1+2a-a+b=1+a$, so $b=2a$.\nNow, $-a+c=1$, so $-a+1+a=1$, so $a=\\boxed{1}$.  Then, $b=\\boxed{2}$ and $c=\\boxed{2}$.  Their sum is $\\boxed{5}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 5. I hope it is correct.-(Modified 2/23/21 by MG0625):+[(Modify made by Tarun)]."
