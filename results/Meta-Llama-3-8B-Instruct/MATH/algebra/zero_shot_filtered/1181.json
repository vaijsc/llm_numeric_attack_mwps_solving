        " \nSee the details below:\nLet x = 1/2 - 1/(2-1/(2-1/(2-...)))\nMultiplying x by 2 gives:\n2x = 1 + 1/(2-1/(2-1/(2-...)))\nSince the equation is an indefinite development, the values can be simplified. This iteration is done to get the desired answer. So we will rename:\n2x = 1 + y\nWhich gives:\ny = 1 / (2 - y)\nSo you can open the right parenthesis:\ny = 1 / (2 - 1/y)\nYou can multiply both sides by y:\ny^2 = y / (2 - 1/y)\nSo you can do some calculations:\n2y \u2013 y = y\ny = 2y \u2013 y\n0 = y\nHowever, we cannot assume that y = 0. because the equation we start with does not include the number 0. To find the actual value of y, we take the derivative of both sides:\ndy/Y dy/dy = d/dy (y / (2 - 1/y))\nExpand and simplify :\ndy/dy + (1/y) * (-1) * (1/(2-1/y)) * (dy/dy) = 0\nCan be rewritten:\ndy/dy = - (1/(y(2 - 1/y))) * dy/dy\nWhich simplifies to:\ndy/dy = 0\nIn other words, dY/dY = 0 is the critical point.\nFinal Answer:\nBecause the equation we start with is symmetric about y = 2, it allows us to analyze it using symmetry. Our answer is obtained by:\nx = 2y\nWhere y is the solution y = 2.\nSo you can write:\nx = 2y = 2(2) = 4\nFinal Answer:\nThe numerical value of x is 4. I hope it helps.

        " If we replace the fraction inside the parentheses in the denominator, we get $x = \\frac{1}{2-\\frac{1}{2- \\frac{1}{\\ddots}}}=\\frac{1}{2-\\frac{1}{x}}$, since the bottom of the fraction is what\u2019s inside the parentheses in the denominator. Next thing, if we multiply both sides of the equation $x = \\frac{1}{2-\\frac{1}{x}}$ by $x$, we get $x^2=\\frac{1}{2-\\frac{1}{x}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{x}=\\frac{1/x}{2-\\frac{1}{x}}=1-\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{1}{x}$. This simplifies to $x^2+1/2x-1=0$. Solving this for $x$ in $\\mathbb{R}$, we find that $x=\\frac{1}{2}$. Now we only need to show that this is the only real solution, to be sure we have the same value in the answer to this problem. It is easy to see that there are no complex solutions. (This is a lot of work for something you won\u2019t be given the chance to prove for a while, but it shows where the proof you would use really comes from.)\nWe do $x^2+1/2x-1=0$, (since the equation $x^2+1/2x-1=0$ is degree 2, it has at most 2 solutions), This form that you have suggests it is in standard form.\nSo, by the quadratic formula $x^2+1/2x-1=0$, the roots of the equation $x^2+1/2x-1=0$ are $x=\\frac{-1/2 \\pm \\sqrt{(1/2)^2+4(-1)}}{2}=\\frac{-1/2 \\pm \\sqrt{(-5)/4}}{2}=\\frac{-1/2 \\pm i \\sqrt{5}/2}{1}$.\nwe can see that $x=\\frac{-1/2 + i \\sqrt{5}/2}{1}$ or $x=\\frac{-1/2 - i \\sqrt{5}/2}{1}$, so these are the two roots.

        " Step 1:\nThe first step we observe is that the fraction 2-(1/2) is actually equivalent to the fraction 2-(1/2) by the definition of the division.

But the expression is symmetrical, so let\u2019s try $x = \\frac{1}{2}$ and substitute it back into the given equation.

Neither an exact value can be determined nor a numerical value exists as the sequence is infinite and there is no way a numerical value can be determined from that.\nThe expression would become an infinite series of framed numbers, if we extend the denominator to three elements, and we have no other option.
