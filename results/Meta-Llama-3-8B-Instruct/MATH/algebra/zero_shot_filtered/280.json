Since $y = -2(x - 9)$, at $x = 0,\\; y = 18$, and at $x = 9,\\; y = 0$, the $y$-intercept is $(0,18)$ and the $x$-intercept is $(9,0)$. In order to keep both $x$ and $y$ integral, we investigate further. Since the slope is $-2$, a negative integer, and $y$ must be a nonnegative integer, $x - 9$ must be a nonpositive integer. This means that all the integer $x$ values between 0 and $9$, inclusive are valid, since $x \\leq 9$ and so $x - 9 \\leq 0$. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{10}$ total lattice points.",

Write x in -x so $2(-x)$, represents $-x$ being multiplied by 2(i.e., what we do to $x$).\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 3. I hope it is correct.

        " 6.\nWe will take a point on the line and try to find the slope. The point is $(0,18)$ and let\u2019s say $a$ is the y-intercept which is $18$ and let\u2019s say the slope is $m$. We know the equation of a line is $y = mx + b$. Since $y = -2x + 18$ is known and we need to find $m$, we can plug it in the equation of a line. $18 = m*0 + 18$. As we know $m$ and $b$, let\u2019s plug them into the equation. $y = m*x + b = -2x + 18$. Now we can use the fact that $(0,18)$ is on the line. We know that for every $x$ and $y$, $y = m*x + b$. Plugging $0$ for $x$ and $18$ for $y$, we can solve for $m$ or $-2$.\n### Final Answer: The final answer is 6.

        " There are $\\boxed{6}$.\nIf $y = -2x + 18$ and $x \\geq 0$, then $y \\geq -2x + 18 \\geq 0$. When $x = 0$, $y = 18$. When $y = 0$, $x = 9$. Therefore, the points $(0, 18), (1, 16), (2, 14), \\ldots, (9, 0)$ are lattice points on the line $y = -2x + 18$. There are $\\boxed{6}$ of these points.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 6.

        " \nFor this question, we will require $y \\geq 0$, that is, $-2x + 18 \\geq 0$. Solving for $x$ yields\n\\begin{align*}\n-2x \\leq -18\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad x \\geq \\frac{18}{2} = 9.\n\\end{align*} The $y$-intercept is $y = 18$ at $x = 0$, where $x \\geq 0$ is satisfied too.  Now, we will count how many lattice points the line contains that are within the constraints.  The line is in a diagonal slope, so each positive integer in the $x$-axis increases $y$ by 2, and the first integer is $x = 9$.  The last integer will have $x = x_{\\max}$, where we set $18 = -2x_{\\max} \\Rightarrow x_{\\max} = 9$, the same value as we found earlier.  Thus, the number of lattice points will be the number of positive integers from $9$ up to and including $9$, inclusive, which is $1$.  We do not include $0$ since that is not a positive integer.  Hence, there are $\\boxed{1}$ lattice points that the line $y = -2x + 18$ passes through.  Notice that another solution could be setting $x = \\frac{18}{2}$ and then subtracting it from both sides of $y = -2x + 18$ to get $y = 0$.  Then we set $y = 0$ from the given equation to get $x = 9$.  Then we plug this into $y = 0$ and get $y = 0$, or $(9,0)$.  We also write $\\frac{18}{2} = 9$.  Adding $0$ to both sides, we get $0 = 9$.  Next subtracting $9$ from both sides yields $-9 = 0$.  (Still incorrect)  Finally subtracting $9$ from both sides one more time, we get $-18 = -9$, or $x = -9$.  We cannot include this in our solution since we were given $x \\geq 0$.  We are told to simply ignore it.  Hence, we find that"
