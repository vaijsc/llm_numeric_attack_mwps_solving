You can back-check the answer as follows: The question states that the average of $A\\$, $B\\$, and $C$ is 10, which is equivalent to saying that $\\frac{A+B+C}{3}=10$. Thus, we have $A+B+C=30$. The question also states that $A$ is 6 less than $B$ and $C$ is 3 more than $B$, i.e., $A=B-6$ and $C=B+3$. Thus, we can write $A+B+C=B-6+B+B+3=3B-3=30$, so $B=11$. Since $C=B+3$, we have $C=11+3=\\boxed{16}$. You can plug in any of these steps to double-check that it is correct. Happy Learning! You can check your work here: .

        " Let $a$, $b$, and $c$ be the values of $A$, $B$, and $C$, respectively. Since the arithmetic mean of $A$, $B$, and $C$ is 10, we can write $$\\frac{a+b+c}{3}=10.$$ Solving this equation for $c$, we obtain \\begin{align*} c &= 3(10) -(a+b)\\\\ &=30 -a-b. \\end{align*} Since $a$ is $6$ less than $b$, we can write $a=b-6$, and since $c$ is $3$ more than $b$, we can write $c=b+3$. Thus, we can substitute these expressions into the equation obtained in the previous step: \\begin{align*} b+3&=30-(b-6-b)\\\\ &=24, \\end{align*} which gives $\\boxed{b=21}$.

I hope it is correct.### Soliloquy:### Heck, I hope it is correct too. I hope I used my correct head, and not my logical one, when doing that problem. Anyway, the idea is that you can add the mean and $(A-1 + C+1)$ to get $B$ (the arithmetic mean and the avg of three numbers has some special properties). Once you do that, you can use the information given to you about $A$ and $C$ to figure out $B$. Why not just do the algebra tho? It is a bit formulaic, but it is efficient. Anyway, lesson learned: just do the algebra already.### Reflection:### Man... I was so close to messing it up. I mean, I did mess it up. I did that problem completely wrong. It was like I didn't even read it. So, that is why I should trust my gut and not try to see how many ways I can mess up a problem. Anyway, doing that problem again and again, I think I have finally figured out what to do. Just do the algebra already! It's always the best solution. Don't try to overcomplicate things. Just be simple and straightforward.### Commiseration:### Yeah, I feel you. I did that problem over and over, but I didn't even get it right the first time either. It's like, I knew what I had to do, but for some reason, I went astray. And then when I tried to do it again, I ended up doing it even worse. It was like, my brain just refused to get it right. But, at least we both learned from it, right? It's just one of those things where you have to put in the time and effort to get it right. And, hey, we got there in the end, even if it was a struggle.### Inspiration:### Yeah, even the best of us struggle sometimes. But, it's",
        " 16\nThe arithmetic mean of a set of numbers is defined as the sum of all entries divided by the number of entries. In this case, the arithmetic mean is 10, so we have:\n$$\\dfrac{A+B+C}{3}=10\\Rightarrow A+B+C=30$$The value of A is six less than the value of B, so $A=B-6$. The value of C is three more than the value of B, so $C=B+3$. Therefore, we have\n$$A+B+C=B-6+B+B+3=3B+(-6)+3=3B{-3}=B$$\nThe arithmetic mean could also be written as $$\\dfrac{B-6+B+B+3}{3}=10\\Rightarrow 3B+(-3)=30$$\n$$\\Rightarrow 3B=30+3=33$$\n$$\\Rightarrow B=\\dfrac{33}{3}=11$$\nAnd since $A=B-6$, we have $A=11-6=5$. Finally, since $C=B+3$, we have $C=11+3=\\boxed{16}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 16. I hope it is correct.bery.bery\nAt the end of the summative assessment on day 5, we wrote 35.

        " Let A = B - 6. Let C = B + 3. Therefore, the arithmetic mean is $\\frac{B-6 + B + B + 3}{3} = 10 \\iff 3B = 36 \\iff B = 12$. Therefore, C = B + 3 = 15.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is C = 15. I hope it is correct.  *Difference with main branch: The assumption  set B - 6 = 0 is valid only when A = 6 and B + 3 = 0 is valid only when C = 3 both of these specific assumption are not given in the problem. It does not mean that B - 6 and B + 3 are the only equations that involve B as the solution . Thus, the  sufficient solution should be expressed as lets variables independently.  Let\u2019s B = 12, which means B - 6 = 6 and B + 3 = 15. These values are all consistent with the given statements about A and C. Final Answer: The final answer is C = 15. I hope it is correct.  I hope it is correct. Well done!  On the other hand, your assumptions B - 6 = 0 and B + 3 = 0 are not supported by the given information in the problem. The given information is B - 6 = A, B + 3 = C and $A+B+C=30$. Therefore, B - 6 = A implies B = A + 6. Substitute B = A + 6 into the other equation B + 3 = C to get A + 6 + 3 = C, which gives C = A + 9. Now, we can substitute A + 6 and A + 9 into the equation $A + B + C = 30$ to get two equations: A + (A + 6) + (A + 9) = 30, which gives 3A = 15, i.e. A = 5, and B = 11, and C = 14. This solution must be at least as good as your solution and, possibly, better if you are dealing with different problems. Final Answer: The final answer is C = 15. I hope it is correct. My answer to this problem is C = 15. I hope it is correct. * I have added my own comments in red.* Final Answer:",
