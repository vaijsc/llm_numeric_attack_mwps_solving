So we have two new equations: x2+y2=65 and (x+y)^2=105, which we can factor into x2+2xy+y2=(x+y)^2. Equating the two, we have x2+2xy+y2=105, and we already know x2+y2=65.

So when we see how $(x+y)^2$ looks, we should also be able to see how $x^2+y^2$ looks if it were to be mirrored.\nThe method will be to draw a diameter of the circle $x^2+y^2$ at an angle proportional to $\\tan\\theta=\\frac{\\partial(x+y)^2/\\partial y}{\\partial(x+y)^2/\\partial x} = \\frac{2y+2x}{2x+2y}$.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdIb-SLefeo  In order to avoid this convoluted route, we can instead take the fact that $x^2+y^2 = 65 \\rightarrow x^2+y^2-65=0$.

        " So, $(x+y)^2 = (x^2 + y^2) + (2xy) = 65 + 2xy$. Since $(x+y)^2 = 105$, we have $65 + 2xy = 105 =>$ $2xy = 40 => xy = \\boxed{20}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 20. I hope it is correct.",
        "  $$\\begin{split} (x+y)^2 & = 105 \\\\ x^2 + y^2 + 2xy & = 105 \\\\ 2xy & = 105 - x^2 - y^2 \\\\ 2xy & = 105 - 65 \\\\ 2xy & = 40 \\\\ xy & = \\boxed{20} \\end{split}$$$$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 20. I hope it is correct.  We use the formula $(x+y)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + 2xy$  to  equate  the two expressions. Then we solve for $xy$ and we will get the answer.  We will get the answer $xy = \\boxed{20}$ .  Now let\u2019s analyze the expression. It seems like the formula is stating we should find our answer by adding 2xy  to our two expressions and then set it equal to 105 in order to solve for xy. This is correct and will lead us to the answer 20.  Final Answer: The final answer is 20. I hope it is correct.  This is a very simple and elegant solution for the problem. It is easy to understand and apply the method to similar problems. It takes advantage of the formula for $(x+y)^2$ to solve for $xy$. I hope it is helpful.  Final Answer: The final answer is 20.

        " \nWe want to eliminate $x$ and $y$ in the problem. So we can write the first equation as $(x + y)^2 = 105 \\Longrightarrow x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = 105$. Let\u2019s subtract the second equation from the first. We have: $(x + y)^2 - (x^2 + y^2) = 105 - 65$. This simplifies to $2xy = 40$. Thus, the value of $xy$ is $\\boxed{20}$. If you would have answered so quickly without writing the steps, it would hard to explain your solution.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 20. I hope it is correct. pls let me know.

Here is the same response written in a different form.\nLet\u2019s go through the problem. To eliminate $x$ and $y$, we can rewrite the first equation as $(x + y)^2 = 105 \\Longrightarrow x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = 105$. Subtracting the second equation from this, we get $2xy = 40$. So $xy = 20$. ",

Therefore, let us start solving the first equation $(x + y)^2 = 105$.\nSolving the equation $(x + y)^2 = 105$, we have $\\left| x + y \\right| = \\sqrt{105}$.
