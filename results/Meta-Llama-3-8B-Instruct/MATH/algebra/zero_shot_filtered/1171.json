        " $\\boxed{350}$. We compute the given sum, i.e., $113+276-13-26$. The two operations that involve subtraction come last, as usual. First, we have $113+276=389$, hence this to the right. Then, to this we minus two, so $389-13=...$, and then $...-26=...$, finishing off as $350$. I hope it is correct. #### Show Step-by-Step Solution: Our sum is given to be $113+276-13-26$. The correct order of operations that we follow in mathematics is to do addition before subtraction. So to start with, we have addition here. $113$ and $276$ we add, and we have $113+276=\\boxed{389}$. This over here with something taking away. Going back to this $389$, we have $385$ when we take $13$ away from it, so we have $389-13=...=...=376$. A final deduction of $26$ from this $376$ gives us our final sum, that is $350$. Final Answer: The final answer is 350. I hope it is correct. #### Check the Answer: It seems correct. Have a look at the procedure executed here. \\begin{align*}\n&113+276-13-26\\\\\n&= 389-13-26\\\\\n&= 376 - 26\\\\\n&= 350\n\\end{align*}This means the answer is correct. If the steps seem unclear or the order of operations confusing, let's break it down again: First we added $113$ and $276$, then subtracted $13$ and then $26$. If you reach the answer $350$ at the end, it is correct. Final Answer: The final answer is 350. I hope it is correct. #### Your Comment: So helpful! Please post some more answers for other questions.

Grade 7 - Number Operations - Third Quarter Final ExamfakultasBiologiannel.heerde Online Final Exam 4 24/02/2023 13:00 Top of Form Problem 2: A student tried to solve $113+276-13-26$ the following way. Since the number 13 is negative and 26 is also negative, you could try subtracting $-13+(-26)=39$, and so, the reply of the student would be 113+276-39. No, that was a mistake. Well, at least we could correct it. What step-by-step solution is correct and helpful? By the commutative law of addition, we have:113+276=113+(276-0)=113+276-0+0=113+276+26-0=113+(276+26)-0=113+302-0=113+302What we have done so far is properly solving 113+276. The next step is to carry out subtraction:113+302-13-26Let s consider the right side of the leftmost side:113+302-13-26=113+302-((13)+(-26))=113+302-39According to the we have done earlier, 113+302=450. So, you still need to subtract 39, which is very easy. 113+302-39=450-39=411The answer is 411. Let s consider the original equation. We have113+276-13-26Indeed, you can see that it is easier to subtract immediately. It s possible to do both answers. Now you have two solutions at the same time. a The bad response:113+276-13-26=113+276-39==113+302-39=411b The good response:113+276-13-26=113+(276-13)-",
        " \nHere, we do the computation:\n$113+276=389$\n$389-13=376$\n$376-26=350$\n$\\boxed{350}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 350. I hope it is correct.  Practice with similar questions. Practice Problems: [Mathway](https://www.mathway.com/Ask) / [Math](https://www.math.com/)\n"
