We know that the line parallel to $y = 4x + 6$ must have the same slope as $y = 4x + 6$, so it has slope 4.  So then, we can write the equation for this line as $y \u2013 10 = 4(x \u2013 5)$. This can be solved for $y$ to get $y = 4x + 6$. So, the $y$-coordinate of the point at which the line crosses the $y$-axis is $\\boxed{6}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 6.

        " First, let\u2019s write down the equation of the line that passes through $(5, 10)$ with the form $y=mx+b$:\n$$y=mx+b$$\n$m$ is the slope of the line.First, we will find out what the slope is. Taking a point $(x, y)$ on the line, let\u2019s say it is $(5, 10)$. The slope of the line can be found using the formula:\n$$m = \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1} = \\frac{10-0}{5-0} = \\frac{10}{5} = 2$$\nNow we know that the slope is $m=2$.\nWe have to find another point on the line. The line has to be parallel to the line $y = 4x + 6$, so by subtracting $6$ from both sides, we get $y = 4x$. We will use this new line with slope $m=4$ to find the other point on the parallel line.\n$$y = 4x$$To pass through the point $(5, 10)$, we set $x = 5$ and solve it:\n$$10 = 4 \\times 5 + b$$\nNow we can solve for $b$:\n$$10 = 20 + b$$\n$$-10 = b$$\nNow we know that $b = -10$, so the equation of the parallel line is:\n$$y = 2x - 10$$\nTo find out where this line crosses the $y$-axis, we set $x = 0$ and solve it:\n$$y = 2 \\times 0 - 10 = -10$$\n### Answer: The $y$-coordinate of the point where the parallel line crosses the $y$-axis is $-10$.Final Answer: The final answer is -10.

To find the equation of the line, we can use the point-slope form of a line: y = m(x - x1) + y1.

        " 6\nThe equation of this line is $(y-10)=(4(x-5))$. We can rewrite this as $(y-10)=-4(x-5)$, which is $y = -4x + 20$. Therefore, the $y$-coordinate of the point where this line crosses the $y$-axis is $\\boxed{6}$.\nLet\u2019s use the previous result. $y=-4x+20=0$.\nSome quick observations in this video. We can see that we have $y = 4x + 6$ which is a line with slope $4$ and the line passing through $(5, 10)$ which means that we have a line of slope $-4$. That helps. One important thing I want to keep here is $y = ax + b\\right|$.\nIn the next two videos, we need to find the point where this line crosses the $y$-axis. Initially, this is in different colors to be more visual. We also note that when a line crosses the $y$-axis, we have $x$ equals zero. $y=a(x-0)+b$. Find the value of $y$ when $x=0$. The same rule applies in the first example. When we know the y-intercept (where the $y$-axis intersects the line).\nTo first find $x$ equals zero. $y = -4(0) + 20$. The same rule, the same rule, so we add $0$ to $20$. We do not add $4$ because here we are adding $x$ equals zero, so $x$ is equal to zero. Because we have to find the $y$-intercept, we can add zero to any real number and you should get the same number; that means that $0$ is only added to $20$, not subtracted. Therefore, when $x$ is equal to zero, $y$ is equal to $\\boxed{20}$. That means that we have found the $y$-intercept of this line passing through $(5, 10)$, and we have found the intersection between $y = 4x + 6$ and the vertical line with $x$ equal to zero, which results in a point at $y$ = $\\boxed{20}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 20. I hope it is correct. Thank you for watching.",
        " First, we find the equation of the parallel line by writing it in $y = mx + c$ format. The given equation $y = 4x + 6$ has a slope of $m = 4$ and a $y$-intercept of $c = 6$. The line passing through $(5, 10)$ should also have the same slope $m = 4$, so we can write the equation of the line in $y = mx + c$ format as $y = 4x + b$, where we need to find the value of $b$. We can use the point $(5, 10)$ to find $b$. So we substitute $x = 5$ and $y = 10$ in the equation $y = 4x + b$ and solve for $b$ as follows:\n$10 = 4(5) + b$\n$10 = 20 + b$\n$b = -10$\n### The equation of the parallel line is $y = 4x - 10$.\n### Next, we can find the point where this line crosses the $y$-axis by setting $x = 0$ in the equation $y = 4x - 10$.

        " We will consider the two possible cases (positive slope and negative slope).\n#### Case 1: Positive Slope\nThe equation of a line with slope $m$ passing through point $(x_1,y_1)$ is $y-y_1=m(x-x_1)$. Since we have the slope $m$ and the point $(x_1,y_1)=(5,10)$, the equation of the line becomes $y-10=m(x-5)$. Now, since this line is parallel to $y=4x+6$, we are identical slopes implies that $m=4$. Substituting $m$ and $(x_1,y_1)$ in the equation of the line, we get $y-10=4(x-5)$. Solving for $y$, $y=4x+6$. We need the $y$-coordinate of the point where this line crosses $y$-axis. In other words, we need to find where $x=0$. Substituting $x=0$, we get $y=4(0)+6=\\boxed{6}$.\n#### Case 2: Negative Slope\nIf the slope is negative, we would have $m=-4$ instead of $m=4$. Then the equation of the line becomes $y-10=-4(x-5)$. Solving for $y$, $y=-4x+10+20=-4x+30$. The line crosses the $y$-axis when $x=0$.

Then there are textbooks that are part of the material or that are linked to ...\n#### Wolfram Alpha: Are there any specific theorems that we need to use here?\nTake the first few steps of verifying that the line is parallel to $y=4x+6$. To do this, we must find the slope and the $y$-intercept of both lines. We can use the given point to find the $y$-intercept of the line $y=4x+b$ by substituting $x=0$ and $y$ into $y=4x+b$.\n$$y=4(0)+b=b$$So, the $y$-intercept of $y=4x+b$ is $b$. Since $y=4x+b$ passes through $(5,10)$, we can substitute $y=10$ and $x=5$ to get $10=4(5)+b$. Solving for $b$ gives $-10=b$. So the line is actually $y=4x-10$. To be parallel to $y=4x+6$, the line must have the same slope, or $4$. So everything looks good so far. At this point we can use the idea of algebraic and geometric patterns learned in EG to answer the questions. Now that we have the equation of the line, we can use the $y",

So we only need to find the slope of this line.\nThe line goes through $(5,10)$, and we know that another point on this line has the `x`-coordinate $5$, so, using the slope formula, we have\n$$\\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \\frac{10 - 6}{5 - 0} = 2.$$(The slope of a line is $\\dfrac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$.)\nA point on this line will be $(0, m)$, where $m$ is the $y$-coordinate of the point.\nSo we can say the equation of the line is:\n$$y-0=2(x-0) \\Rightarrow y=2x.$$(We can calculate the slope again using the slope formula as before.)\nThe point where the line crosses the $y$-axis will be (0,$m)$, where $m$ is the $y$-coordinate.

Therefore, an equation for the line is $y-10=4(x-5)$. (If you don\u2019t think this, go back and review your work with parallel and perpendicular lines.) Hence the equation is $y=4x-4$. To find the $y$-coordinate of the point where this line crosses the $y$-axis, let $x=0$. $y=4(0)-4 = -4$. The point of intersection is the origin $(0,-4)$. Hence, the answer is $\\boxed{-4}$. It sounds good to me. Final Answer: The final answer is -4. I hope it is correct.",
        " To solve this problem, we need to find the equation of the line that passes through $(5, 10)$. To do so, we can use the point-slope form of a line. First, we will calculate the slope of this line by using the coordinates of the point $(5, 10)$. Since the line passes through this point and we know its $y$-intercept $b$ (it equals $6$), we can set up the equation of the line: \\begin{align*} y&=4x+6\\\\ \\implies 10&=4(5)+6\\\\ \\implies&10=26\\\\ \\end{align*}i.e., the line passes through $(5, 10)$, and the equation of this line is given by $y = 4x+6$.\nThus, we can now substitute in $x = 0$ for the given equation to determine the $y$-intercept.\nTherefore, we get $y = 4\\times0+6 = 6$ which is the $y$-intercept. Therefore, the $y$-coordinate of the point where this line crosses the $y$-axis is \\boxed 6.\n### My Solution: No errors\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 6. I hope it is correct. Commentary:\nI would guide the student to calculate the equation of the perpendicular line. Then they would be able to use it to solve the problem.\nFinal Comment: I will review the final solutions. +Checker Ernst\u2019s suggestion is excellent. In problem # 6, Paul\u2019s solution is correct, but he was mistaken when he noted that the line simply \u201cpasses through $(5, 10)$.\u201d  Rather, he was asked to write the equation of the line in point-slope form, not the equation of the line in slope-intercept form, which happens to be $y=4x+6.$  So, his solution could have been improved slightly by rephrasing the question.  Overall, however, his solution is correct, and I award this problem 5 points. Forgot to tell Paul about reviewing the final response to recount the problem. I will do so at this time, but I will not update the grading since it has already been completed. Later, I can see [Ernst\u2019s suggestion] and use it for feedback.

        " 24\nHere, you should find the equation of the line by using the point-slope form of a line in which you use the point that is given in the problem, namely (5,10), and some other point on the line. The other point can be chosen as (0,0), which is the y-intercept of the line. So, here the equation of the line would be in the form y-y1 = m(x-x1), where m is the gradient of the line, which you can find by differentiating y = 4x + 6 to get m = 4. By using the points (0,0) and (5,10), you can find the equation of the line; first, you substitute x = 0 and y = 0 in the equation of the line and get y = 6, and then you substitute x = 5 and y = 10 in the equation of the line and get y = 26, and finally, you take y = 0 away from y = 6 to get the equation of the line as y = 4x + 6.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 24. I hope it is correct.",
        " To find the equation of the line parallel to $y = 4x + 6$ that passes through $(5, 10)$ we need to consider both points on this line: the given point $(5, 10)$ and one point, say $(0, a)$ on the $y$-axis. This means $a$ is the $y$-coordinate of the point where this line crosses the $y$-axis! The slope of the line remains the same as $y=4x+6$, so for the new line, we have $y=4x+b$. Since the line passes through $(5, 10)$ we can find b by plugging in $x=5$ and $y=10$ into the equation, so $10=4(5)+b$ or $b=-10$. Therefore the new line is $y=4x-10$. At $x=0$, we have $y=a=4(0)-10=-10$, so the answer is $\\boxed{-10}$.\nNote that by plugging in $x=0$ into the equation $y = 4x + 6$ we can also find the value of $b$ since $b = 6$ but that is not necessary in this problem. The point is that both $(0, a)$ and $(5,10)$ are on the same parallel line.\nImage: A line parallel to $y = 4x + 6$ passes through $(5, 10)$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -10.

        " We know that the line $y=4x+6$ is parallel to the line $y=kx+m$.\nThis equation for the line that passes through (5, 10) is $y=4x+6$.\n### ",
        " Step by Step Breakdown:\nWe want a line parallel to the line $y = 4x + 6$ that passes through the point $(5, 10)$. This means that this line also passes through $(5, 10)$ with the same slope as the line $y = 4x + 6$.\nIf a line has the equation $y = mx + b$ where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the $y$-intercept, then the slope is $m$. In our case, the slope $m$ of the line $y = 4x + 6$ is 4. This line passes through the point $(0, 6)$, which is the $y$-intercept: let $x = 0$ and solve for $y$:\n$$0 + 6 = 6 \\Rightarrow y = 6.$$\nSo, we can say that the line $y = 4x + 6$ has equation $y = 4x + 6$. Now, we want to write the equation of a line that has the same slope as this, which is $4$, but passes through the point $(5, 10)$. We can use the point-slope form of a line, which is $y - y_0 = m(x - x_0)$. Substituting $m = 4$, $x_0 = 5$, and $y_0 = 10$, we have\n$$y - 10 = 4(x - 5) \\Rightarrow y - 10 = 4x - 20 \\Rightarrow y = 4x + 10.$$\nThis is our line.\nNow, we want to find where this line crosses the $y$-axis. We can do this by letting $x = 0$:\n$$y = 4 \\cdot 0 + 10 \\Rightarrow y = 10.$$\nSo, the $y$-coordinate of the point is $\\boxed{10}.$\n### End of ",
        " 12\nA line parallel to $y = 4x + 6$ will have the same slope, which is 4. Using the point $(5, 10)$, we can write an equation for our line: $y = 4x + 22$. The point where the line crosses the $y$-axis will have $x=0$, so $y = 4(0) + 22 = \\boxed{12}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 12.

Note that $y_2$ is the $y$-coordinate of the point where this line crosses the $y$-axis.\nAlso, since the point $p_1$ lies on the line and it is parallel to $y=4x+6$, our line has the same slope as the given line, i.e. $m=4$.\nSo, using the two-point form for slope, we have: $m=\\frac{y_2-10}{0-5}=\\frac{y_2-10}{-5}\\implies 4=\\frac{y_2-10}{-5}\\implies y_2-10=-20\\implies \\boxed{y_2=-10}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -10.

        " First, we must figure out the equation of the line parallel to $y = 4x + 6$ that passes through $(5, 10)$.\nBecause the two lines are parallel,$$y-10=m(x-5),$$for some value $m$. If you recall, $m$ is the slope of the parallel line. Next, since we know $(5, 10)$ is on the line, we can plug in $5$ for $x$ and $10$ for $y$.\n\\begin{align*}\n10-10&=m(5-5)\\\\\n0&=0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad m&=\\text{'any numerical value'}.\n\\end{align*}\nTo find the value of $m$, we must look at another point that lies on the line segment $(5, 10)$.

        " \nWe can use one point to find the line. $$\\begin{cases}y & =4x+6 \\\\10&=4(5)+6\\end{cases}$$ The line is $y = 4x + 6$. A line parallel to $y = 4x + 6$ is $y = 4x + c$ where $c$ is a constant. We want to find $c$. In point $(5,10)$, we have $10 = 4(5) + c$, or $c = 10 - 20 = -10$.

        " 22\nIf we have $y=4x+6$, then the slope is 4. When we pass through $(5, 10)$, we can substitute the given coordinates in the function: $10 = 4(5) + 6$. Now, we have 10 = 26 or 10 - 26 = 0. Then subtract 26 from the other side, so we have 10 - 26 = 0. This means that the line parallel to $y=4x+6$ is:  $y-10=4(x-5)$ $y-10=4x-20$ $y=4x-10$.\nTo find the $y$-coordinate of the point where this line crosses the $y$-axis, set $x=0$ in the expression.

        " We use the approach that we\u2019ve seen many times before: first find an equation of the line of the requisite type and then use it to make the necessary computation.\nThe line passes through $(5, 10)$, and we could fit it with an equation $y = mx + b$ for some real numbers $m$ and $b$.  This is done by computing $m = (10 - 6)/5 = 2/5$, the slope of the line passing through $(0,6)$ and $(5,10)$.  In other words,\n\\begin{align*}\nm &= \\dfrac{10-6}{5-0} = \\dfrac{10-6}{5}\\\\\n&=\\dfrac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x} = \\mbox{Slope of the line}.\n\\end{align*}\nThis simplifies to $m = 2/5$.  As well, we know,\n\\begin{align*}\nb&=10-m(5)\\\\\n&=10-2/5(5)\\\\\n&=10-(2)(1)\\\\\n&=\\boxed{8}\n\\end{align*}\nbut only needed the last line. In other words, $b = 8$.  Therefore, the line in question is of the form $y = (2/5)x + 8$.  \nWe are required to compute the $y$-coordinate of the point this line crosses the $y$-axis.  This happens at $x = 0$, since if $x$ is increased, $(2/5)x$ is too.  Plugging this value in, we have $y = 8$, which is the answer.",
