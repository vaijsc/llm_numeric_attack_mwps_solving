You should always have your final answer as a $\\boxed{\\text{...}}$, and include the exact calculation without omitting any numbers, units or the like. Usually, the exact calculation should include The entire intermediate steps and not omitting any numbers. You can assume that the audience is able to work out the steps by them self but you should write them in. So, from this day forward, always make sure to include the final answer with the name of the final answer section, and the calculation with the full step-by-step detail.

        " A line segment with endpoints $(a, b)$ and $(x, y)$, has the formula for the midpoint $(x_m,y_m)$ as $$\\left(\\frac{a+x}{2},\\frac{b+y}{2}\\right)=(x_m,y_m)$$\nWe know that:\nx = (x_1 + x_2)/2 and y = (y_1 + y_2)/2\nNow, the question says the midpoint is at $(1, 2)$.

        "  Here's my answer:\nLet $A=(3,9)$ and $B=(x,y)$ be two consecutive points on a line segment.  We can find $x$ and $y$ using the coordinates of $A$ and the midpoint $(1,2)$.
