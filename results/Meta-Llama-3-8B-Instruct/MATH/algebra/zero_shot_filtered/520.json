I hope it is correct.\u00a0\u00a0### Help: I don't understand how the text is using grouping and distributive properties of multiplication.### Explanation: Let's say we want to simplify the expression $(u+4)(u-1) - (u-3)(u+6)$. First, we distribute the multiplication:$(u+4)(u-1) = u^2+3u-4$(similarly, we distribute another multiplication to get $(u-3)(u+6) = u^2+3u-18$Now, we subtract $(u-3)(u+6)$ from $(u+4)(u-1)$:$(u+4)(u-1) - (u-3)(u+6) = u^2+3u-4 - u^2-3u-18$Notice that we have two $u^2$ terms. (Actually, they are the same, but for simplicity, let's treat them as different). When we subtract these two terms, they cancel out:$(u^2+3u-4) - (u^2-3u-18) = 7u-22$Ta-da! We're done. (You could get the same answer using more algebra; but understanding why the polynomial terms cancel is important too).### Key concepts: \u2022 Distributive property of multiplication over addition and subtraction \u2022 Canceling out like terms (here, terms with the same variable(s)) \u2022 Basic polynomial addition and subtraction rules\n#### Imageination",
