        "To solve the problem, let\u2019s represent the three consecutive even integers. \nWe can denote the first even integer as \\( x \\).

        " 20\nHere\u2019s one way to explain it. The even numbers will be $x-2$, $x$, and $x+2$. If the sum of these three is 66, then $x-2+x+x+2=66$. Simplifying this equation, we get $3x=66$, and $x=22$.\nThe smallest of these three integers is $\\boxed{20}$, because $22-2=20$. Correct! It only takes one such example to earn a passing grade.\n### Hint: What could be done to make the problem simpler?\nDo you have any idea how we could actually solve this problem without simplifying the expression in this way? Can we assume something special about the even integers? Maybe\u2026 what if we can assume the even integers are multiples of 2? Once we make this assumption, then we can simplify the expressions and solve for the unknown! We can assume that the three consecutive even numbers are $x-2$, $x$, and $x+2$, each of which is a multiple of 2. If we let $2n$ be a solution to the original problem for general $n$, then $2n-2$, $2n$, and $2n+2$ will be the solutions to the problem. Since their sum is 66, we have $$2n - 2 + 2n + 2n + 2 = 66$$ $$\\Rightarrow\\qquad 6n = 66$$ $$\\Rightarrow\\qquad\\boxed{n = 11}$$ Once we have this general value, we can find the desired smallest number by plugging in $n = 11$ to obtain the solution $2n = 2(11) = 22$. This value yields the smallest consecutive even number: $\\boxed{20}$. Does your way to solve the problem look a bit clearer now? You can make that assumption, and you will have a much more straightforward way to solve the problem. This problem-solving method also allows you to check your answer: do you remember what it says about $n$? If we assume that the even numbers are multiples of 2, then we can just solve for $n$ and check if the result makes sense. In this case, since we assume the even numbers are multiples of 2, we can check if $2n$ really is the smallest option by seeing if $2n$ is indeed even when $n=11$. And, of course",

        " The following is a solution:\nLet $x$ be the smallest of the three consecutive even integers. Then $x+2$ and $x+4$ are the other two, and we know that $x+(x+2)+(x+4)=66$.

Since the integers in question are consecutive, the question is essentially asking for an integer that, when added to any two of its consecutive integers, gives $66$. We may try $x=20$:\n$20+22=42 \\\\ 20+24=44 \\\\ 42+44=86$. This was a good guess, so $x=\\boxed{20}$ is the answer.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 20. I hope it is correct. Let $x$ be the smallest even integer. The others will be $x+2$ and $x+4,$ so we set up the equation \\begin{align*}\nx+(x+2)+(x+4)&=66\\\\\n3x+6&=66\\\\\n3x&=60\\\\\nx&=20.\n\\end{align*}This is the smallest possible solution. If we test it, we can see that it works: 20+22+20=62.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 20. I hope it is correct. If $x$ is the smallest even integer, the other two are $x+2$ and $x+4$, so we set up the equation $$x+(x+2)+(x+4)=66\\Rightarrow 3x+6=66\\Rightarrow 3x=60\\Rightarrow x=20.$$ 20+22+20=62.
