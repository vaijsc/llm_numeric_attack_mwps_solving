Geometric mean is the square root of the product of two numbers. It is defined by \u00a0$\\sqrt xy$, where x, y are the numbers. 2. Therefore we have an equation: $$\\sqrt xy=19.$$3. Using these two equations we can make an equation: $$x+y=\\frac{14}{1}.$$ $$xy=19^2=361.$$ 4. Now we have two equations. We can solve them: \\begin{align*}\nx+y&=\\frac{14}{1}\\\\\nxy&=361\\\\\n\\frac{(x+y)^2}{4}&=\\frac{(",
        " \nThe two given conditions can be expressed as follows:\n$\\frac{x+y}{2} = 7$\n$\\sqrt{xy} = \\sqrt{19}$\nWe begin by solving for $x$ and $y$ in terms of each other and then find $x^2+y^2$.\nFirst, we simplify the second equation to get $xy = 19$. Squaring both sides, we get $x^2y^2 = 19^2$. However, we can also rewrite $x^2y^2$ as $(x+y)^2 - 2xy$ (by the difference of squares), and we know $x+y = 14$ (by the first equation), so we have $14^2 - 38 = 19^2$, which simplifies to $2 = 2$. So far, all is well!\nNow, we are left with the first equation $\\frac{x+y}{2} = 7$, or $x+y = 14$. We also know $xy = 19$. Dividing the second equation by the first equation gives us $\\frac{y}{x} = \\frac{19}{12}$. Cross-multiplying and simplifying, we get $y = \\frac{19}{12}x$.\nNow, square $x$ and $y$ to get $x^2$ and $y^2$, respectively, and expand and combine like terms to get $x^2 + y^2 = x^2 + \\frac{19}{144}x^2 = \\frac{169}{144}x^2$. (The $x^2$ terms can be combined now because they have the same variable and same coefficient.)\nBut wait \u2013 we have $x+y = 14$, so $\\frac{19}{12}x + x = 14$, or $\\frac{25}{12}x = 14$. Simplifying gives us $x = \\frac{168}{25}$. Then, plugging back into $x^2 + \\frac{19}{144}x^2$ gives us $\\frac{13^2}{25} = \\boxed{\\frac{169}{25}}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\frac{169}{25}. I hope it is correct.

Then the **arithmetic mean** of $a$ and $b$, denoted by $\\frac{a+b}{2}$, is the average of $a$ and $b$.  The **geometric mean** of $a$ and $b$, denoted by $\\sqrt{ab}$, is the square root of the product of $a$ and $b$.\nNow if $x$ and $y$ are real numbers, then the sum of the arithmetic mean and the geometric mean of $x$ and $y$ is\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\frac{x+y}{2}+\\sqrt{xy}\\\\\n=&\\frac{1}{2}\\left(x+y\\right)+\\sqrt{xy}.\n\\end{align*}We also recall from our given information that the arithmetic mean of $x$ and $y$ is $7$ and the geometric mean is $\\sqrt{19}$. We should therefore substitute $7$ and $\\sqrt{19}$ into the equation above:\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\frac{x+y}{2}+\\sqrt{xy}=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(x+y\\right)+\\sqrt{xy}=7+\\sqrt{19}\\\\\n=&\\frac{1}{2}\\left(x+y\\right)+\\sqrt{xy}\\\\\n=&\\frac{1}{2}\\left(x+y\\right)+\\sqrt{xy}.\n\\end{align*}Now we have both sides simplified into the same format.  We also know that $\\sqrt{xy}=\\sqrt{x}\\sqrt{y}$.  We should therefore substitute this into the equation:\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\frac{x+y}{2}+\\sqrt{xy}\\\\\n=&\\frac{x+y}{2}+\\sqrt{x}\\sqrt{y}.\n\\end{align*}We see that we have reached a stage where we may simplify $\\sqrt{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$:\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\frac{x+y}{2}+\\sqrt{x}\\sqrt{y}\\\\\n=&\\frac{x+y}{2}+\\sqrt{x}\\sqrt{y}\n\\end{align*}Our given information is that $(x+y)/2=7$, so we should substitute $14$ for the $7$ in the equation above:\n\\begin{align*}\n",

        " First, note that the arithmetic mean of $x$ and $y$ is equal to $\\frac{x+y}{2}$, so $\\frac{x+y}{2} = 7$. Then, in order to solve for $x+y$, we must multiply both sides of this equation by 2, giving us\n$$x+y=2(7)=14.$$Now, the geometric mean is given by $\\sqrt{xy}$, so the equation given in the instructions tells us that $\\sqrt{xy} = \\sqrt{19}$. We can get rid of the square root symbol by squaring both sides of this equation, so we get $xy=19$.\nNow we have a system of two equations:\n$$\\begin{cases}\nx+y = 14 \\\\\nxy = 19\n\\end{cases}$$We need to find a way to express $x^2+y^2$ using only the variables $x$ and $y$, which are not easily accessible at this point. Therefore, we need to build an equation involving $x^2+y^2$ only.\nWe can do this by squaring the first equation. When we square it, we get $$\\begin{array}{rcl} (x+y)^2 &=& 14^2 \\\\ x^2+2xy+y^2 &=& 196. \\end{array}$$Now solve the system of equations.\nWe can express $xy$ from one equation and substitute it into the other. For example, we can subtract the second equation from the first: $$x+y-xy=14-19=-5\\Rightarrow y=x-5.$$We can also express $x$ using $y$: $$x=14-y.$$We have two expressions for $x$ and can substitute either into the equation involving $x^2+y^2$: \\begin{array}{rcl} x^2+y^2 &=& (14-y)^2+y^2 \\\\ &=& 196+2(14-y)y+y^2 \\\\ &=& 196+28-14y+2y^2+y^2 \\\\ &=& 224+2y^2-14y \\end{array}\nNow we have $2y^2-14y$ and need to get rid of the $y$ term. We can use a clever trick here: recall that $xy=19$, and since $y=x-5$, we have that $x(x-5)=19$, which means",
