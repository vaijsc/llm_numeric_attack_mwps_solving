Substituting $x=10$ into the first equation gives $10+y=12$ so $y=2$. Therefore, $2x-xy=2(10)-10(2)=20-20=0.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 0. I hope it is correct. </br>",
        "  We have that $x+y=12$. Subtracting $x-y=8$ from both sides gives us $2y=4\\implies y=2$. Plugging that back in gives $x=10$. So, $2x-xy=2\\cdot 10-10\\cdot2=\\boxed{0}$.",

        " Since $x+y = 12$ and $x-y = 8$, we can easily solve for $x$ and $y$.  Let\u2019s do so.  From $x+y = 12$, we know that $y = 12 - x$.\nIn the second equation, $x-y=8$, we can substitute $y=12-x$ into the right side to get $x-(12-x)=8$.\nThis gives $2x-12=8$, so $2x=20$.  This gives $x=10$.\nNow we can find $y$.

Final answer: One simple approach is to use elimination: to make the coefficients of y to the same sign,\nmultiply the first equation by 3:\n$3x-6y = 18$.\nadd this to the second equation:\n$2x+y=4$\nto obtain $5x=22$ so $x=22/5$. From $x+y=4$ one have $y=4-x=(4-22/5)=(4\\times5-22)/(5)=38/5=15/2$\nWe therefore have:\n$$2x+3y=2\\cdot \\frac{22}{5}+3\\cdot\\frac{15}{2}=\\frac{44}{5}+\\frac{45}{2}$$\nFinal answer:  $\\frac{179}{10}$.",
        " If $x+y=12$, then $y=12-x$.\n### Reason: Adding 8 to x will give y\n### Calculations: So $x-y=8$ will give $x-[12-x] = 8$ when plugged in. Simplifying that equation will result in $x-12+x = 8$ which is $2x=20$. Then, $x=10$.\n### Solution: After obtaining that value of $x$, it\u2019s then necessary to find the sum ($y$) or difference ($y$ too) to get $y$. $x+y=12$, which means $10+y=12$. Solving, will give $y=12-10=2$.\n### Solution and Conclusion: Then, it\u2019s now possible to find 2x \u2013 xy ($2 * 10 \u2013 10*2$).\n$2x-xy=2*10-10*2=20-20=\\boxed{0}$ After simplifying (CF: No solution needed. ) the equation, $2x-xy = 0$.

        " I believe that $\\boxed{x=10}$ and $y=2$.\n#### Explanation: \n### Begin with solution\nIf we add $x+y = 12$ and $x-y = 8$, we get $2x = 20$, so $x = 10$.  If we take $x = 10$, we can solve for $y$ using the first equation:  \\begin{align*}\n10 + y &= 12\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\quad y &= 12 - 10 = 2\n\\end{align*}  We can compute $2x-xy = 2 \\cdot 10 - (10)(2) = 20 - 20 = \\boxed{0}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 0.

When do you stop solving for y in the answe chosen?\n(I've actually solved these questions before in another workshop but never really thought about why $\\boxed{16-12=4}$. I realized that both expressions are equal to 2x, and then we have 2x - 2x*y/2x. After simplifying, we are left with 1 - y. Finally, we can substitute y in terms of x and solve.\nThen we are left with the answer y = -4. and since $x=6$, we get 2x - xy = 16 - 48 = -32. I think that I should have seen that y = -4 in my first try, but maybe it was a rush or something.\nHow can I improve this thought process? I think I usually neglect small details and rush through some of the questions. How can I avoid this?\nHow do you approach such questions?\nI'm really glad you took the trouble to not only answer the question but also have a self-reflection on your thought process. That's super valuable!\nYour first approach was good, but indeed you rushed through some of the steps. When you got to the equation $x-y=8$, you just plugged in $2x$ and solved for $y$ without checking if that was a valid operation. In fact, you had already solved for $x$ in the previous step, so you could have immediately written $x-y=8\\Rightarrow -y=8-2x$, which would have led you to the solution much faster.\nYour second approach, though, is a great demonstration of Persistence! It's excellent that you worked through the algebra and arrived at the correct answer. When solving equations, it's essential to remember to check our work and be mindful of any assumptions we make. In this case, your intuition told you that $x+y=12$ and $x-y=8$ were both telling you something about $x$, but you didn't initially see the common thread ($2x$). That's okay! It's a natural",
