For instance, at 50 miles per hour, in an hour and a half, or $1\\frac{1}{2}$ hours, the car has travelled $50\\cdot 1\\frac{1}{2} = 50\\cdot \\frac{3}{2} = 75$ miles.

        " This question is asking us how far the car would travel. Let\u2019s start by finding out the time. Since we are talking about hours, the time will be the 2 hours and we also need 3/4 hours. We need to add 2 hours and 3/4 hours. We have 2 3/4 hours. Since the denominator for the whole number and the denominator for the fraction is the same, 4, we can rewrite it as 11/4 hours. The time is 2 and 3/4 hours.\nNow we can use the formula for distance. Distance equals the speed times the time, or d=s*t. The speed is 50, and the time is 11/4 hours. 50*11/4 is 137.5. Now we have a decimal number, and we can rewrite it as a mixed number. We have 137 wholes, and 0.5 leftover. 137 + 0.5 is 137 1/2. Since we are talking about miles, the car will travel 137 1/2 miles.\nThis is the distance. The car will travel 137 1/2 miles.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 137 \\frac{1}{2}.

I hope it is correct.  \nSo let's calculate \nAs you have mentioned you want to know how far a car travel in $2\\frac{3}{4}$ hours at the speed of 50 miles per hour.  \nFirstly, let us convert $2\\frac{3}{4}$ hours into fraction.\nLet's convert $2\\frac{3}{4}$ into a fraction.\n$2\\frac{3}{4} = 2 + \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{8}{4} + \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{8+3}{4} = \\frac{11}{4}$\nNow, we have the speed of the car which is $50$ miles per hour.\nWe have the time in hours which is $\\frac{11}{4}$.\nWe have to find how far the car would travel.\nSo, we use the formula \nDistance = Speed * Time\nHere, $Distance = 50 * \\frac{11}{4}$\nNow, let's calculate the value of $50 * \\frac{11}{4}$\n$50 * \\frac{11}{4} = 50 * \\frac{11}{4} = 5 * 11 = 55$\nSo, the correct answer is $\\boxed{55}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 55. I hope it is correct.   \nAt the end of the problem, you need to convert the answer back to a mixed number, which you didn't do. Remember that you can write the answer as a mixed number by writing the whole number part and then the remainder over a denominator of 1. In this case, the whole number part is 55, and the remainder is 0.\nSo, to get the final answer, we need to convert 55 to a mixed number. That's 55.\nTherefore, the final answer is 55.",

So the answer is 137.5. 137.5 is equal to 56 3/4 (mixing the number). So the answer is **56 3/4.**\n    2. The car travels 50 miles per hour. In 2 hours it will travel 50 * 2 = 100 miles and in 0.75 hours it will travel 50 * 0.75 = 37.5 miles. So in total it will travel 100 + 37.5 = 137.5 miles. Which is equal to 56.25 hours.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 56 3/4. I hope it is correct. Final Answer: The final answer is 56.25. I hope it is correct.

However, you can also simplify answer directly $$50 \\times 2 = 100$$ Then $$100 + 75 = 175 + 3 = 178$$ Also, you can use the formula $$disnce= speed* time$$ $$disnce= 50* \\frac{11}{4} = 55\\frac{1}{4}$$\nNow that's a lot of calculation but we got the same answer which is 55\\frac{1}{4}. I hope my thought process with the simplest approach help you. If you want, I can explain the formula approach and elaborate more on it. Just let me know. \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffb\nTo elaborate more on the formula approach, we are given speed = 50mph and time = 2 \\frac{3}{4} hours. So, we can write $$disnce= speed* time$$ $$disnce= 50* \\frac{11}{4}$$ $$disnce= 50 \\times 2.75$$ $$disnce= 137.50$$ $$disnce= 137$$ hours * 60 minutes = 8220 minutes $$disnce= 8220$$ miles Now, to convert back into hour and minute, you can do conversion $$\\frac{8220}{60}= 137$$ miles * hour + \\frac{20}{60}= 2 hours + 20 minutes $$disnce= 137$$ miles * hour + 20 minutes= 137\\frac{20}{60}= 137\\frac{1}{3} hours\nAnd again another way of simplifying is $$disnce= 50* \\frac{11}{4}$$ $$disnce= 50 \\frac{4}{4} + 50 \\frac{7}{4}$$ $$disnce= 50 + 12.50$$ $$disnce= 62.50$$ So, the distance will be $$62.50$$ miles.\nThrough these ways, we arrived at the answer 55 \\frac{1}{4} which is same in all cases. These ways will be useful for larger numbers and harder problems. Please let me know if you have any further questions or need more elaboration.",
        " We start by converting $\\frac{3}{4}$ to the approximate 0.75. Then multiply this to 2 to obtain 2.75. Now, multiply \\frac{50 \\cdot 2.75}{1} = \\frac{137.5}{1} = 137.5 and thus we have a mixed number of \\boxed{137\\frac{1}{2}}. Follow the same logic from the previous examples.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 137\\frac{1}{2}. I hope it is correct. ### "
