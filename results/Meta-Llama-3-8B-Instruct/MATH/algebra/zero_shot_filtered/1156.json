This is an example of applying the distance formula. The distance formula also allows us to calculate the speed and path of an object moving along a line in a specific direction. It is used in various fields such as engineering, navigation, medicine, and more. It is a very important concept in mathematics calculations.\u3002\nTo check the answer, you can verify the distance $13$ by counting how many units long the line segment is.\nDraw a rough sketch of the line segment by starting at $-3$ on the $x$-axis and moving horizontally to the right $5$ units (from $-3$ to $2$), then moving vertically down $12$ units (from $7$ to $-5$). The total distance between the two points is the sum of these two movements. $5$ units horizontally plus $12$ units vertically equals $13$ units. So the line segment is indeed $\\boxed{13}$ units long.",
        "\u00a0 Our units are horizontal (right-left) and vertical (top-bottom). Right now we are looking at points only, ahead. We need to figure out how long the line joining $(-3,7)$ to $(2,-5)$ is, going \u201cstraight\u201d.\u00a0 In our case, we are using rectangular coordinates (x,y). Thus the length of our line will be the square root of the sum of squares of the differences of the corresponding points. Our final theorem looks like this: \u221a [ (x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2]\nHere\u2019s where it gets a bit tricky. We have $(x2-x1)^2$ plus $(y2-y1)^2$ which is subtracting 3 from 2 which is going to be -1 squared or 1. Then we have 7 minus -5 which is 12 squared or 144. So our sum will be 1 + 144 and take the square root to get \u221a 145 (remember we are looking for length and length of our line segment is a straight-line distance).\n### Answer: So the length of our line segment whose endpoints have coordinates $(-3,7)$ and $(2,-5)$ is\u00a0\u221a145. ### Always review your work: Looking at my work, I see that I have added and subtracted correctly, that my answer is reasonable and answers the question, which it was asking about the length of the line segment, and that I've followed the steps, which was simply a matter of following a pattern. Thus, I am confident in my final answer of\u00a0\u221a145 as the length of the line segment with endpoints at $(-3,7)$ and $(2,-5)$.

        " We are given the coordinates $(-3,7)$ and $(2,-5)$. In vector form, this is $(-3,7)$ minus $(2,-5)$. The vector to the segment $(2,-5)$ is $-5$ unit right and $-12$ unit down. Since the $x$ distance is greater than the $y$ distance, we need to think of it as sitting on top of a line that heads downhill. We must describe it in terms of simplified fractions by using a common denominator. The first thing to do is to get a shared number, and the easiest way to do this is to multiply both $-5$ and $-12$ by a number to get denominators that share a factor; in other words, make sure both denominators are $5$. To do this, we can multiply by $5/5$, which is equivalent to multiplying by 1, which changes the vector but does not change its length: \\begin{align} -5 \\cdot \\frac{5}{5} &= -25/5\\\\ -12 \\cdot \\frac{5}{5} &= -60/5 \\end{align} We then have $\\frac{25}{5}$ in the $x$ direction and $\\frac{60}{5}$ in the $y$ direction, so we need to calculate the distance by the Pythagorean Theorem: \\begin{align*} {\\left( \\frac{25}{5} \\right)}^2 + {\\left( \\frac{60}{5} \\right)}^2& = \\left(\\frac{625}{25}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{3600}{25}\\right)\\\\ &= \\frac{625+3600}{25}\\\\ &= \\frac{4225}{25}\\\\ &= \\frac{169}{1}\\\\ &= 169 \\end{align*} Taking the square root, we obtain $\\sqrt{169} = 13$.

        " [Empty]\nSolution . A line segment is described by a starting point and an ending point.  When I have a problem like this, I think about how I can use the pythagorean theorem.  Here I can think of it in terms of slope and the distance formula.  We can get the slope between two points by the formula: $\\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}$.  For our points, this becomes $\\frac{-5-(7)}{2-(-3)}=\\frac{-12}{5}=\\frac{-12}{5}$.
