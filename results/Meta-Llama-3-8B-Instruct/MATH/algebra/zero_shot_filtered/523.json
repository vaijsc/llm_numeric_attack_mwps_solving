I hope it is correct. ### Explanation: We are given that $\\log_{\\sqrt{5}} 125\\sqrt{5}$. First, we know that we can rewrite $\\sqrt{5}$ as $5^{1/2}$. We can also rewrite $125$ as $5^3$, and $125\\sqrt{5}$ as $5^3\\left(5^{1/2}\\right)$. Using the generalized power property of logarithms, we get \\begin{align*}\n\\log_{\\sqrt{5}} 125\\sqrt{5} &= \\log_{\\sqrt{5}}\\left(5^{3+1/2}\\right)\\\\\n&= \\log_{\\sqrt{5}}\\left(5^2\\cdot5^1\\right)\\\\\n&= \\log_{\\sqrt{5}} 5^2 + \\log_{\\sqrt{5}} 5^1\\\\\n&= 2\\log_{\\sqrt{5}} 5 + 1\\log_{\\sqrt{5}} 5\\\\\n&= 3 \\log_{\\sqrt{5}} 5\\\\\n&= 3.\n\\end{align*}So, we have that $\\log",
        " $\\boxed{\\frac{7}{2}}$",
        " \nStep 1: Think base $\\sqrt{5}.$ Let $x = \\log_{\\sqrt{5}} 125\\sqrt{5}$. By definition of logarithm, we need to find $a$ such that $\\sqrt{5}^a = 125\\sqrt{5}$. So we have $\\sqrt{5}^a = (5^{3/2})(\\sqrt{5}) = 5^{3}$. Since both sides have same base, we can just equate exponents: $a = 3$. So $x = \\boxed{3}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 3. I hope it is correct.  If you have any confusion or any other question, please don't hesitate to ask.  Thanks.  the way of final answer is proper and clear. #### Step-by-step Method: 1. First Step: Let us define logarithm as follows:-  $$\\log_{\\sqrt{5}} 125\\sqrt{5}$$ 2. So we need to solve for the exponent $$a$$ of the base $a$ such that  $$\\sqrt{5}^{a} = 125\\sqrt{5}$$ 3. To solve for $$a$$ we solve $$(\\sqrt{5})^{a} = 125\\sqrt{5}$$ 4. And we simplify to  $$5^{\\frac{a}{2}} = 5^{\\frac{3}{2}}$$ 5. Thus we have the equality  $$\\frac{a}{2} = \\frac{3}{2}$$ 6. And solving for $$a$$ gives $$a = 3$$ 7. Thus our final answer is $$\\boxed{3}$$  #### Final Answer: The final answer is 3. I hope it is correct.  If you have any confusion or any other question, please don't hesitate to ask.  Thanks.  So, the method is used to shorten the steps and achieve the answer quickly. It is a good way to learn mathematics.  There may be other ways to solve a problem, but this way helps to understand the matter.  Thanks.  Please let me know if you want to add or change something.

So this is another proof that the answer is 7. But, in mathematics, we try to give the whole proof, not just the results. So, we need to write the whole proof, even if it is long or complicated. Sometimes, however, we have to just use the calculator to verify our answer, because it may be too complicated or long to write the whole proof by hand. So, we have two solutions: write the whole proof and use the calculator. The last solution is always to use the calculator.
