Then, using the exponentiation/power rule for expressions like $a^m\\cdot a^n$, we see that $2^4\\cdot2^4=2^{2x}$.  Because the exponents differ by $4$, we can rearrange the equation to obtain $2^4=2^{2x-4}$.  Therefore, we have that $4=2x-4$.  Solving for $x$ gives us that the value of $x$ is $\\boxed{3}$.\\\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 3. I hope it is correct.

        " Here is my response:\nTwo powers will always be equal when their exponents are equal. Therefore, we can equate the exponents $8$ and $x$:\n$$8 = 2x$$Simplify both sides:\n$$4 = x$$So, the value of $x$ is $\\boxed{4}$.\nWould you like me to elaborate or is there anything else I can help you with?\n### Hint:\nAn exponential equation of the form $2^8=4^x$ can be rewritten as $2^{8}=(2^2)^x$ and further, it can be simplified as $\\boxed{(2^2)^4=2^8}$.",
