    "solution": "Two side lengths are straightforward.  We have $AB = 15$ because the $y$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ are the same and their $x$-coordinates differ by 15.  Similarly, the $y$-coordinates of $B$ and $C$ differ by 8 and their $x$-coordinates are the same, so $BC = 8$.  We could either notice that $\\triangle ABC$ is right, or use the distance formula (i.e., the Pythagorean Theorem) to see that  \\[AC = \\sqrt{(9-(-6))^2 + (-2-6)^2} = \\sqrt{15^2 + (-8)^2} = 17.\\] So, the perimeter of $ABC$ is $15+8+17 = \\boxed{40}$.",

        " Perimeter of polygon\nFirst, find the missing vertex of the triangle. Using the coordinate system, we can calculate the distance between points A and B and between points B and C:\n$$\\overline{AB} = \\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2} = \\sqrt{(9-(-6))^2+(6-6)^2} = \\sqrt{15^2+0^2} = 15$$\n$$\\overline{BC} = \\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2} = \\sqrt{(9-9)^2+(-2-6)^2} = \\sqrt{0^2+8^2} = 8$$\nThus, we can find the missing vertex:\n$$D = (9-2,6+8) = (7,14)$$\nNow, let\u2019s find the perimeter:\n$$p = \\overline{AB} + \\overline{BC} + \\overline{CD} + \\overline{DA}$$\nWe can calculate the distances between the points A, B, C and D:\n$$\\overline{AB} = 15$$\n$$\\overline{BC} = 8$$\n$$\\overline{CD} = \\sqrt{(7-9)^2+(14-(-2))^2} = \\sqrt{(-2)^2+16^2} = \\sqrt{400} = 20$$\n$$\\overline{DA} = \\sqrt{(7-(-6))^2+(14-6)^2} = \\sqrt{13^2+8^2} = \\sqrt{225} = 15$$\nSo we have the perimeter:\n$$p = 15 + 8 + 20 + 15 = 58$$\nAnswer: The perimeter of the polygon is **58** units.annah\n### What's the decimal approximation of $\\tan \\frac{\\pi}{12}$?\nInto your calculator, we get:\n$$\\tan \\frac{\\pi}{12} \\approx 0.416664dim$$\nWe want to simplify this notation.

        " The following is the steps.\nStep 1: Define the polygon\nThe given points are  $A(-6,6),B(9,6),C(9,-2)$, which are graphed and connected with straight lines. These points form a polygon. For finding the perimeter, we need the coordinates of the points, and we also know that these points will be connected to each other with straight lines.\nStep 2: Find the distance between points\nTo find the perimeter of the polygon, we need to first find the distance between the points. Let\u2019s find the distance between the points $A,B,C$.\nDistance between $A(-6,6)$ and $B(9,6)$: \nThe formula for distance between two points is:\n Dist(A,B) = sqrt((x_{b}-x_{a})^2 + (y_{b}-y_{a})^2)\nDist(A,B) = sqrt((9-(-6))^2 + (6-6)^2) \nDist(A,B) = sqrt(15^2 + 0^2)\nDist(A,B) = sqrt(225) \nDist(A,B) = 15\nDistance between $B(9,6)$ and $C(9,-2)$: \nThe formula for distance between two points is:\n Dist(B,C) = sqrt((x_{c}-x_{b})^2 + (y_{c}-y_{b})^2)\nDist(B,C) = sqrt((9-9)^2 + (-2-6)^2) \nDist(B,C) = sqrt(0^2 + (-8)^2)\nDist(B,C) = sqrt(64) \nDist(B,C) = 8\nDistance between $C(9,-2)$ and $A(-6,6)$: \nThe formula for distance between two points is:\n Dist(C,A) = sqrt((x_{a}-x_{c})^2 + (y_{a}-y_{c})^2)\nDist(C,A) = sqrt((-6-9)^2 + (6-(-2))^2) \nDist(C,A) = sqrt((-15)^2 + (8)^2)\nDist(C,A) = sqrt(225 + 64)\nDist(C,A) = sqrt(289)\nDist(C,A) = 17\nStep 3: Find the perimeter\nThe perimeter of the polygon is given by the sum of the distances between the points:\nPerimeter = Dist(A,B)",
        " \nThe given points are (-6,6), (9,6), and (9,-2). From these points we can draw an isosceles triangle ABC where AB = AC = 15. Now the perimeter of triangle ABC is given by P = AB + BC + CA. We know that AB = AC = 15. The y-coordinate of B and C is the same so BC is horizontal distance. Let's calculate this distance:  The distance between the points (9,6) and (9,-2) is 8. Now we have P = 15 + 8 + 15 = 38. Therefore the perimeter is 38 units.\nAnother way to find the perimeter is to use the distance formula. Let's use it for AB: AB = sqrt((9-(-6))^2 + (6-6)^2)  = sqrt(15^2 + 0) = sqrt(225) = 15.\nWe can use the same distance formula for BC: BC = sqrt((9-9)^2 + (-2-6)^2)  = sqrt(0 + 49) = sqrt(49) = 7.\nWe can use the same distance formula for AC: AC = sqrt((9-9)^2 + (-2-6)^2)  = sqrt(0 + 49) = sqrt(49) = 7.\nNow the perimeter is P = 15 + 7 + 7 = 29.\nCompare it with the previous answer.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 38.

Since line $q CA$ forms a right triangle with the line $p$, the length of line CA is made.\nThe vector of the line BC is CB=<9+9, 6-(-2)>=<18, 8>. Since line $q BC$ forms a right triangle with the line $p$, the length of line CB is made.\nThere we go! We have the side lengths of our polygon: 15, 15, and 18.

Use distance formula:\n$$\\text{distance}=\\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2}$$\nStep 4: Using the distance formula, we measure the distances between $A, B$ and $B, C$.\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sqrt{(9-(-6))^2+(6-6)^2}&=\\sqrt{(15)^2}=15, \\\\\n\\sqrt{(9-9)^2+(6-(-2))^2}&=\\sqrt{64}=8\n\\end{align*}\nSo the vertices connect to form a triangle with sides of 15 and 8 units in length.\nStep 5: Calculate the perimeter.\n$$\\text{perimeter}=15+8+AB$$\nWe don\u2019t know the side $AB$ yet. To calculate it using distance formula, we first find $A(6,6), B(9,6)$.\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sqrt{(9-(-6))^2+(6-6)^2}&=\\sqrt{(15)^2}=15\n\\end{align*}\nSo the distance $AB$ is the side already calculated, which is 15 units.\nStep 6: Calculate the perimeter.\n$$\\text{perimeter}=15+8+15=\\boxed{38\\text{ units}}$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 38 units.

        " \nIn the triangle $ABC$, the coordinates of points $A$ and $B$ are $(-6, 6)$ and $(9,6)$, respectively. The base length of the triangle is $BC = AB = \\sqrt{(9-(-6))^2+(6-6)^2} = \\sqrt{15^2 + 0^2} = \\sqrt{225} = 15$.\nSimilarly, the coordinates of points $A$ and $C$ are $(-6, 6)$ and $(9, -2)$, respectively. The base length of the triangle is $AC = \\sqrt{(9-(-6))^2+(-2-6)^2} = \\sqrt{15^2+(-8)^2} = \\sqrt{225 + 64} = \\sqrt{289} = 17$.\nSince $AB$ and $AC$ are sides of the triangle $ABC$, the perimeter of the triangle $ABC$ is $P = AB + BC + AC = 15 + 15 + 17 = 47$.\nTherefore, the perimeter of the polygon is 47. Final Answer: The final answer is 47. I hope it is correct.  I suggest that you should check by drawing a diagram because this solution is based on mathematical calculations. You can quickly visualize the perimeter by drawing the diagram.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 47. I hope it is correct.  I suggest that you should check by drawing a diagram because this solution is based on mathematical calculations. You can quickly visualize the perimeter by drawing the diagram.  Both responses might appear identical, but here they are. There was a mild fluctuation due to my poor eye contact. Each figure had a slightly different kind of weirdness, although they did share a few similarities. I suppose I should keep an eye on issues like this in the future. I hope you find my answer helpful! Let me know when you're ready for me to proceed.  Here is my final answer. Final Answer: The final answer is 47. I hope it is correct.  I suggest that you should check by drawing a diagram because this solution is based on mathematical calculations. You can quickly visualize the perimeter by drawing the diagram.  Justify your response.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 47. I hope it is correct.  I suggest that you should check by drawing a diagram because this solution is based on mathematical calculations.
