        " \nLet $C$ be the cost of carpeting a floor and $A$ be the area of the floor. Since $C$ and $A$ are directly proportional, we have $$C=CA_0/A_0,$$ where $A_0$ is the area of the reference floor. If we multiply both sides of the equation by $A_0$ we can solve for $C$: $$A_0 C=C(A_0+1).$$ We can write $A_0=C_0/A_0$ where $C_0$ is the cost of the reference floor. Substitute and we get $$A_0=C_0/A_0*C_0/(A_0*C_0)=C_0^2/A_0.$$ Substitute given values for $C_0$ and $A_0$, and simplify: $$A_0=105^2/(14*5)=105$$.\nNow we can use our first equation to find the cost of carpeting a floor of area $A$, where $A_0=14*5=70$, and $A=16*13=208$. $$C=CA_0/A_0=105^2/70*C=105*C$$\nTherefore, if $C=\\$$105$costs$\\$$105.00 to carpet a floor with area 70 square feet, then $\\$$105*C$costs$\\$$105*C.00 to carpet a floor with area 208 square feet.

We are given that it costs $\\$$105 to carpet a $14\\times 5$ square feet. In other words, if there was a whole floor that was just $14\\times 5$ square feet, it would cost $105.

The selling price of a TV has increased by 10% last year. If the TV was priced at 800 dollars, what is the new selling price?\nOriginal price = 800 dollars\nNew price = 800 + (10% of 800) = 800 + 80 = 880 dollars\n2. A car's fuel capacity increased by 10% last year. If the car now has the capacity to hold 25 liters of fuel, what was its fuel capacity before the increase?\nOriginal fuel capacity = 25 / (1 + 10%) = 25 / 1.1 = 22.99 liters\n3. A famous singer had a sales of 5,000 records last year and had an increase of 15% in their sales. What was the total number of records sold this year?\nOriginal sales = 5,000 records\nIncrease in sales = 15% of 5,000 = 5,000 / 100 x 15 = 750 records\nTotal sales this year = 5,000 + 750 = 5,750 records\n4. The price of a book was 100 dollars before the VAT of 10% was added. \nWhat is the new price of the book if the increased price is a discount of 5% on the original price?\nOriginal price of the book = 100 dollars\nVAT = 10% of 100 = 100 / 100 x 10 = 10 dollars\nNew price of the book = 100 + 10 = 110 dollars\nDiscount = 5% of 110 = 110 / 100 x 5 = 5.5 dollars",

In probability, if we double the area, the cost doubles as well. The price per unit of area is 105/14x5. This is equivalent to 105/70. So if we need to find the cost of an area of 16x13, then we need to find the cost of 16x13 areas. In simple, 16x13 areas. We can find the cost by multiplying 16x13 with the extent per unit of area. 105/70 area x 16x13. This is equal to the extent of 160 square feet with a cost of 312. Therefore, the cost of carpeting a floor of 16x13 square feet is 312. The final answer is 312. Here we have a simple problem that involves proportional relationships.
