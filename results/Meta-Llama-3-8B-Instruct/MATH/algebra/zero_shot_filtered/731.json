    "solution": "Although it's easy to simply multiply out the squares and compute, there is a more elegant solution. We are looking at an equation of the form $x^2 - y^2$, and we know that this factors into $(x+y)(x-y)$.

Thank you! \ud83d\ude0a\nLet\u2019s use the fact that for all real numbers a and b, $(a+b)^2-(a-b)^2 = 4a b$. This can be proven algebraically by using the identity $(a+b)(a-b) = a^2-b^2$. In our case, we have $a=7$ and $b=5$. So, $(7+5)^2-(7-5)^2 = (12)^2 - (2)^2 = 144-4 = 140$. But, the problem asks for the value of $(7+5)^2-(7-5)^2$ which is equal to $140$.

This is the final answer. ### Super Solution This involves a technique called \"factoring\" (noting). Factoring is a way to present a sum or difference of two quantities in a more compact and simplified form. For example, 4(3)+2(3) can be factored as 6(3) = 18. The final steps of our calculation were: $(7+5)^2-(7-5)^2 = 7^2+2(7)(5)+5^2-7^2+2(7)(5)-5^2$. The two quantities had the same value, one with a $+$, one with a $-$ sign. Therefore, they can indeed be factorized together: $2(7^2+2(7)(5)+5^2)$. The rest is easy: 7^2+2(7)(5)+5^2 is just 49+70+25 = 144. Now, the $2$ in the front has to be applied, resulting in 144 * 2 = 288. But then we see that there is a $2$ at the end of the original expression that should be factored out, and that it is 2*(7^2+2(7)(5)+5^2) \u2013 2(7^2-2(7)(5"
