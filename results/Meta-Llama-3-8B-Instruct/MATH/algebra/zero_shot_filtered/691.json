        " 88\nThe first step is to square 7/4. \\begin{align*} \\left(\\frac{7}{4}\\right)^2&=\\frac{49}{16}\\approx3.0625\\end{align*} The number 49/16 is equal to 3.0625, and this is not an integer. Since we are doing ceiling, we will need to round up to the nearest integer. Because 3.0625 is greater than 3, the ceiling is 4. So \\left(\\frac{7}{4}\\right)^2=4\\approx\\left(\\frac{7}{4}\\right)^2\\approx3.0625 \\end{align*}Now we need to square 4 again to get the final answer. \\begin{align*}4^2=\\boxed{16\\approx88} \\end{align*} Therefore, the answer is 88.
