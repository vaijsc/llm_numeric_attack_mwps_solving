I hope it is correct.qrt to help you. The math way tells us where the capacitance of the inductor is so naturally encapsulated and we know it's 0.\nThat's right. So in that case, we have only resistance RL. The op amps act like a voltage follower and invert both inputs of the inductor. That means the current that passes through them will be the same but the voltage across them will be complementary. The fact that they perfectly mirror each other ensures the voltage across the inductor is constant. This is the origin of the loss-less function in R-C-L.\nLet's see what the operational amplifier circuit delivers. The output follows both input voltage inclinations using a transfer gain.
