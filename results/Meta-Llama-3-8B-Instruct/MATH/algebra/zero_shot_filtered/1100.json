Multiplying both sides of the equation by $x+1$ gives\\[\\frac{x-9}{x+1}(x+1)=2(x+1).\\]This simplifies to\\[x-9=2x+2.\\]Next, we distribute $2$ to the terms within the parentheses: \\[x-9=2x+2.\\]Next, we rewrite the left side of the equation: $x-9=x-9$.

Thank you for your patience!\n# Solving the algebraic equation\nGiven the equation\n\\[\\frac{x-9}{x+1}=2,\\]we need to solve it to find the value(s) of $x$ such that the equation holds.\nTo solve this, we can follow these steps:\nFirst, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\\begin{align*}\nx-9&=2(x+1)\\\\\nx-9&=2x+2\\\\\n\\end{align*}\nNext, to make it easier to solve, we can subtract $2x$ from both sides:\n\\begin{align*}\nx-9 &= 2x+2\\\\\n-x &= 2x+2-9\\\\\n-x &= 2x-7\\\\\n\\end{align*}\nNow, we can combine the terms together:\n\\begin{align*}\n-x &= 2x-7\\\\\nx+2x &= -7\\\\\n3x &= -7\\\\\n\\end{align*}\nFinally, we can divide both sides by $3$ to solve for $x$:\n\\begin{align*}\n3x &= -7\\\\\nx &= \\frac{-7}{3}\n\\end{align*}\nSo, the solution to the equation is $\\boxed{x=\\frac{-7}{3}}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -\\frac{7}{3}.

        " Solving this equation:\nWe begin by putting the equation in the same denominator.\n### Solution:\nWe start by putting the equation in the same denominator.\n$\\frac{x-9}{x+1}=\\frac{x-9}{x+1} \\cdot \\frac{x-1}{x-1}$\n$\\frac{x-9}{x+1}=\\frac{(x-9)(x-1)}{(x+1)(x-1)}$\n$\\frac{x-9}{x+1}=\\frac{x^2-10x+9}{x^2+x-1}$\nSince there is now a common denominator on both sides, we can multiply the denominators to get rid of them.\n$\\frac{x^2-10x+9}{x^2+x-1}=\\frac{x^2-10x+9}{x^2+x-1} \\cdot(x+1)(x-1)$\n$\\frac{x^2-10x+9}{x^2+x-1}=(x+1)(x-1)$\nWe can now cross multiply.\n$(x+1)(x-1)(x^2-10x+9)=x^2+x-1$\nExpanding the left side, we get:\n$\\left(x^{2}+x-1\\right)\\left(x^{2}-10x+9\\right) = x^{2} + x - 1$\n$\\left(x^{3}-x^{2}-10x^{2}+10x+9x-9\\right) = x^{2} + x - 1$\n$\\left(x^{3}-11x^{2}+19x-9\\right) = x^{2} + x - 1$\nWe now combine like terms on both sides.\n$x^{3}-11x^{2}+20x-9 = x^{2}$\nWe now factor both sides.\n$(x+1)(x-9)=x^{2}$\nThis is obviously wrong since $(x+1)(x-9)$ does not net out to $x^{2}$, so we go back to the initial equation.\n$\\frac{x-9}{x+1}=2$\nCross multiplying gives us:\n$(x-9)(x+1)=2(x+1)$\n$x^{2}-8x-9=2x+2$\n$x^{2}-10x-7=0$\nNow we can solve for $x$",
        "Step 1: We may get rid of the fraction.  \\begin{align*} \\frac{x-9}{x+1} &= 2\\\\ (x-9)(x+1) &= 2(x+1)\\\\ x^2-x-9 &= 2x+2\\\\ x^2-3x-11 &= 0. \\end{align*}Step 2:  Now we try to factor the quadratic: \\begin{align*} x^2-3x-11 &= 0\\\\ (x-11)(x+1) &= 0. \\end{align*}Step 3: So, we have:\n\u2022 Either $x-11=0$:  $x=11$\n\u2022 Or $x+1=0$:  $x=-1$\nFirst, we check for extraneous solutions. Other than $x=11$, $x=-1$, for any other world real number $x$ we have $\\frac{x-9}{x+1}$ may be undefined ($if x+1=0$) or equals to 0 which not match with $\\frac{x-9}{x+1}=2$. For example, at the root of the quartic polynomial $-x^3-2x^2-x+6$. Therefore, by process of elimination, $x=11$ and $x=-1$ are the both the solution. To increase readability, the solution is kept manageable by avoiding to directly solve all algebraic equations with a method such as linear approximation. It's  more convenient to break the problem and its solution into the numbered steps for more understanding.   Therefore $x=\\boxed{-1, 11}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -1, 11. I hope it is correct.",
        " First, we will multiply both sides of the equation by $x+1$ to get: $$\\frac{x-9}{x+1}(x+1)=2(x+1) \\Rightarrow x-9=2x+2$$ Adding 9 to both sides, we can simplify this to: $$x=11$$ Thus, the solution is $\\boxed{x=11}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is x=11. I hope it is correct.  \\[\\frac{x-9}{x+1}=2\\] for  x. Let\u2019s think step by step. ### ",
        " \\[\\frac{x-9}{x+1}=2\\]\nWe can multiply both sides of the equation by $x+1$ to eliminate the fraction.  This gives\n\\[x-9=2x+2.\\]\nNow we can move all the terms to one side of the equation, obtaining\n\\[-x=11.\\]\nFinally, we add $11$ to both sides to get\n\\[x=\\boxed{-11}.\\]\nSo, $\\boxed{-11}$ is the solution.\nNote that numerical methods for solving such a problem would work too! We wouldn\u2019t have to use a combination of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
