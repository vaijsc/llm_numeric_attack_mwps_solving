        "To find the distance from the point \\((x, y)\\) to the origin, we first need to determine the values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) using the equations given:\n1.

Now substituting into the quadratic formula:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{13 \\pm \\sqrt{73}}{2}\n   \\]\n9.

I hope it is co First, we can substitute $y = 13 - x$ into $xy = 24$ to obtain $x(13-x) = 24$. Expanding and simplifying, this gives $x^2 - 13x + 24 = 0$. Fact",
        " We are asked to find the distance from the point $(x, y)$ to the origin. And we know that $x + y = 13$ and $xy = 24$. We can use the distance formula. The point is $(x, y)$ is defined by the location of its horizontal and vertical coordinates. So, to find the distance from the point to the origin is $d=\\sqrt{(x^2)+ (y^2)}$.\nUsing the two given equations, we can solve for $x$ and $y$. Multiply the first equation by $y$ to get $xy+y^2=13y$. Then use the second equation $xy=24$ to replace $xy$, getting $24+y^2=13y$. Subtract 24 from both sides to get $y^2-13y+24=0$. Then, use the quadratic formula. $x=\\frac{-(-13)+\\sqrt{169-4(1)(24)}}{2(1)}=\\frac{13+\\sqrt{1}}{2}$\nLet $y=\\frac{13+\\sqrt{1}}{2}$, then $x=\\frac{13-\\sqrt{1}}{2}$. Now, we can calculate the distance. $d=\\sqrt{(x^2)+(y^2)}=\\sqrt{(\\frac{169-1}{4})+(\\frac{169-1}{4})}=\\sqrt{\\frac{168}{4}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{42}{1}}=3\\sqrt{7}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 3\\sqrt{7}.

There is an alternative method. You can use the equation $x + y = 13$ to express $y$ in terms of $x$ ($y = 13 - x$) and then substitute it into $xy = 24$ and solve for $x$, and then find the distance using the distance formula.

        " Since $(x, y)$ is a point on the graph of $xy = 24$, then we draw the following graph: ![](https://prometheus.my_BUILD_1545756024.assets/1536305-1545876872851-12_l.png) When you move along this line forever, you will eventually hit the x-axis, which is $y = 0$. So, we can take $y = 0$, and solve for $x$. $$x + 0 = 13 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = 13.$$ Now, since we know $x = 13$ and $y = 0$, we can move to the value $(13, 0)$.\n### ",

The distance from the point of intersection to the origin will be the answer.\nTo find the intersection, set $y$ equal in both equations and eliminate $y$:\n\\begin{align*}\n-x^2/24 + 13 &= -x + 13\\\\\n\\Rightarrow -x^2/24 &= -x\\\\\n\\Rightarrow x^2 &= 24x\\\\\n\\Rightarrow x(x - 24) &= 0.\n\\end{align*} Since $x + y = 13$, $y$ must be negative when $x = 24$, so we discard $x = 24$ as a solution.

It matches the problem's prompt, which is asking \"find the distance from the point $(x, y)$ to the origin.\" The value $11$ is given in the formula for the distance, which is $\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$. It is also the value of $\\sqrt{121}$, which is the simplified form given in the problem's solution. Therefore, it is the most correct answer.  still satisfied with the answer. satisfying the options.,\" can someone help me prove it?!  -26c Get help from our top tutors with easy online lessons! \ud55c and two formulas \ub354\ube14 \ud55c check 1 (x+y)^2 x^2+y^2+2xy \uc548 24.

        " What is our goal?\nTo find the distance from the point (x, y) to the origin. We have two equations, x + y = 13 and xy = 24.",
        " The point $(x,y)$ is $(x, 13-x)$. Since $xy = 24$, $x(13-x) = 24$. That is, $24x = 24$ or $x=1$.\n### From this, $13-x = 12$, $y = 12$.\n### The distance from the point $(x, y)$ = $(1,12)$ to the origin is\n$\\sqrt{(1-0)^2 + (12-0)^2} = \\boxed{\\sqrt{169} = 13}$. So, the distance is 13.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 13. I hope it is correct. For any part of the problem for which the answer was not correct, please let us know the answer correct.

        " $x$ and $y$ are both real numbers, since they give a solution to a linear equation with integer coefficients. Thus, if we divide the quadratic equation $x^2 + y^2$ by $x^2 + y^2 = (x + y)^2 - 2xy$ and rearrange terms, we get\n$$x^2 + y^2 = (13)^2 - 2(24) = 25 \\Rightarrow (x, y) = (3, 10)$$\n### Final Answer: The final answer is 10.
