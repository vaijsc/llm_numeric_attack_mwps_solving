        "To find the sum of the squares of the solutions to the quadratic equation \\(2x^2 + 4x - 1 = 0\\), we can start by identifying the solutions using the quadratic formula.

Because of the quadratic formula, we can say that the solutions to this quadratic equation are $x_1 = \\frac{-b-\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$ and $x_2 = \\frac{-b+\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$. In our case, $a=2$, $b=4$, and $c=-1$. Therefore, $x_1$ and $x_2$ are $\\frac{-4-\\sqrt{4^2-4(2)(-1)}}{2(2)}$ and $\\frac{-4+\\sqrt{4^2-4(2)(-1)}}{2(2)}$, or $-1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{9}}{2}$ and $-1-\\frac{\\sqrt{9}}{2}$.
