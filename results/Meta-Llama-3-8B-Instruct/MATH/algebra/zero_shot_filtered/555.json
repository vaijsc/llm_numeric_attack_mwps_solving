        " Let $a$ denote the largest possible value of $x$. Then $x^2 - 5x - 36$ must be equal to $0$. This means that $x$ can take any value such as $0$, $1$, $2$, $3$, $\\ldots$ up to a certain point. Then the expression should equal $0$.",

        " \nWe are asked to find the largest value of $x$ such that $x^2-5x-36=0$.\n### Step 1: Recognize the quadratic equation.\nWe recognize that $x^2-5x-36=0$ is a quadratic equation, so we should try using the quadratic formula.\n### Step 2: Write out the quadratic formula.\nWe know that the quadratic formula is, in general,\n$x=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}.$  In this case, we have\n$a=1$, $b=-5$, and $c=-36$, so we can plug these in.\n### Step 3: Plug these values into the quadratic formula and simplify.\nWe plug in the values, simplify, and get\n\\begin{align*}\nx&=\\frac{-(-5)\\pm\\sqrt{(-5)^2-4(1)(-36)}}{2(1)}\\\\\n&=\\frac{5\\pm\\sqrt{169}}{2}\\\\\n&=\\frac{5\\pm13}{2}\n\\end{align*}This yields $x=\\frac{5+13}{2}=9$ and $x=\\frac{5-13}{2}=-4$.\n### Step 4: Find which value is largest.\nWe can now compare the two values: $9$ and $-4$.\n### Conclusion:\nWe conclude that the largest value is\n$\\boxed{9}$. Therefore, $x$ can have a maximum value of 9.",
        " The question can be solved using the quadratic formula. First we find the discriminant: $(b^2 \u2013 4ac) = (-5)^2 \u2013 4(1)(-36) = 25 + 144 = 169$. The quadratic formula is: $x = \\frac{-b \u00b1 \\sqrt{(b^2 \u2013 4ac)}}{2a} = \\frac{-(-5) \u00b1 \\sqrt{(169)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{5 \u00b1 13}{2}$. Hence we have $x = 9$ or $x = -4$. Since $9$ is larger, the largest possible value of $x$ is 9. Final Answer: The final answer is 9. I hope it is correct. wirung ### Another approach: We can break down the quadratic equation into $(x+6)(x-9) = 0$ to conclude that $x = -6$ or $x = 9$. The problem asks what is the largest possible value of $x$. Final Answer: The final answer is 9. I hope it is correct. sougyu ### Yet Another approach using Vieta's Formulas: First, note that $x = -6$ or $x = 9$, as found by factoring. Then, we can use Vieta's formulas for the roots of a quadratic equation to find the sum and product of the roots. For this quadratic, we have that $a = 1$, $b = -5$, and $c = -36$. Then, we can write that $(x+6)(x-9) = x^2-5x-36$, so the sum of the roots is $(-6) + 9 = 3$ and the product of the roots is $(-6)(9) = -54$. Since we know these values, we can use vieta's formulas to find that $x = 9$ when we have $x^2-5x-36=0$. Final Answer: The final answer is 9. I hope it is correct. xsyleez ### Yet Another approach using the Factoring Formula: We can factor a quadratic equation using the factoring formula: $x^2+bx+c$ can be factored as $(x+p)(x+q)$, where $p+q = b$ and $pq = c$. Here, $b = -5$ and $c = -36$. Thus, we",
