It is of the form $a^2 - b^2$ where $a$ and $b$ are integers, so it can be factored accordingly as $$(x + ?)(x - ?)$$  To find the unknowns in this expression, evaluate $a^2$ and $b^2$, which are $x^2$ and $9$, respectively. Hence, we set $a = x$ and $b = 3$ in $a^2 - b^2 = x^2 - 3^2$. Then we obtain $$(x + 3)(x - 3) = x^2 - 9.$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is (x+3)(x-3).

        " To compute $32^2 - 18^2$, we follow the rule ($a-b$)($a+b$) = $a^2-b^2$. Therefore, the answer is 1024 \u2013 324 = 700.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 700. I hope it is correct. \nHere's an elevated repeat:\nSo let's deal with it.\nTo compute 32 squared minus 18 squared, follow the rule (a - b)(a + b) = a^2 - b^2.\nSo we have 32^2 - 18^2.\n(32)(32) - (18)(18) = 1024 - 324.\nAnd the thing is, the 1024 - 324 = 700.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 700. I hope it is correct.  ### ",
