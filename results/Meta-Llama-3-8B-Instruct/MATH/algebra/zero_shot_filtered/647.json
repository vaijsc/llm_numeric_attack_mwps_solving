So, even though the base is not an integer, we don\u2019t need to separately test to see if the result is positive or zero. Assuming the base is a real number and $n$ is an integer, $b^{n}$ is always equal to the $n$th power of $b$. For example, $2^{3} = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 8$, $3^{2} = 3 \\times 3 = 9$, and $4^{0} = 1$. On the other hand, $\\left(\\frac{16}{625}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{4}}$ is not simplified until we simplify it.\n2. $\\left(\\frac{16}{625}\\right)^{\\frac14}$ can be simplified by simplifying each number only. Simplifying the numbers is not a guarantee that the result is simplified. We do not know which simplifications we have gotten or if there are closed-form solutions based on factorization. By simplifying the base, we do not have all the information or possibilities to obtain the simplified form.\n3. For non-integer exponents, there may be other ways to",
