        " $g(f(5)-1) = g(2(5)-3-1) = g(8 - 4) = g(4)$.\nSo, $g(f(5)-1) = g(4)$. Then find $g(4)$.\n$g(4) = 4 + 1 = 5$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 5. I hope it is correct.  ### notice that $g(x) = x+1$ is a linear function, so $g(4) = 4 + 1 = 5$ also makes sense. This solution uses the same method, but it also justifies the linearity of $g(x)$. I think it\u2019s more helpful for students to see the justification of linearity, even if it means a longer response. So I would recommend using this solution instead.  ### Overall, the response is correct. It can be further simplified, but the method is sound.  For example, we can write $g(f(5)-1)$ as $(f(5)-1)+1$ using the definition of $g(x)$. This then becomes $f(5)$. We can evaluate this to $f(5) = 2(5) - 3 = 5$, which is what we would get if we had simply plugged in $x$ for $g(x)$ and for $f(x)$ in the original expression. So the final answer would simply be $5$.  However, the original response is correct, and it\u2019s important to encourage students to think about these functions as functions \u2013 rather than simply evaluating them. It\u2019s helpful to encourage students to break down these expressions step by step, and I think the original response does that well.  ### Written by Eric Freudenthal  I am an IMACS instructor and tutor.

Considering both $f(x) = 2x - 3$ and $g(x) = x + 1$, let's apply them in the expression $$g(f(5) - 1).$$So $f(5)$ is equivalent to $(2)(5) - 3 = 10-3 = 7$, and we subtract 1 from that, so we have $7-1 = 6.$\nWe are left with the expression $$g(6) = (6+1) = 7.$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 9. I hope it is correct.1\n$g(f(5)-1)=g(f(5))-g(1)=g(2\\cdot5-3)=g(7)-g(1)=7-1=9$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 9. I hope it is correct.1\nLet's compute the desired quantity by evaluating it from the right.\n$$g(f(5)-1)=g(2\\cdot 5-3-1)=g(9)=9+1=9$$Since $g(x)=",
        " \n$\\;\\;\\;g(f(5)-1) = g((2\\cdot5 -3)-1)$\n$\\;\\;\\;g(5-3-1) = g(1) = \\boxed{2}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2. I hope it is correct. \n## References:\n______\n[1] Math Open Reference\nThis question is concerned with using given functions, $f(x) = 2x - 3$ and $g(x) = x + 1$, to find the value of $g(f(5) - 1)$. The solution involves substituted the given functions into the problem and solving step by step: $g(f(5) - 1) = g((2(5) - 3) - 1) = g(1) = 2$. This corrects any confusion for students and provides a clear illustration of the process.\n______\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2. I hope it is correct.  ",
