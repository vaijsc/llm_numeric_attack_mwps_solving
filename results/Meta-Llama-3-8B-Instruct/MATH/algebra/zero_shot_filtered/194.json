I hope it is correct.### Final Step:\nThus, the company needs to sell at least $\\boxed{446}$ widgets in order to make a profit. I hope this steps and the final answer are correct. 1. Suppose 220 widgets are sold.  The revenue from the sales is $220 \\cdot 2.75=\\$600$.  The cost of the widgets is $220 \\cdot 0.50=\\$110$.  The equipment fee must be paid first, so the net profit from this business is $600-110-1000=-\\$410$.  We do not know if the company had a loss or a positive profit, but we know that this option will not be the best solution.  2. Suppose 443 widgets are sold.  The revenue from the sales is $443 \\cdot 2.75=\\$1211.25$.  The cost of the widgets is $443 \\cdot 0.50=\\$221.50$.  The equipment fee is still not paid, but since the revenue is greater than the cost, the earnings are positive.  However, the cost of equipment has not",
        " Here is a problem.\nLet\u2019s define the number of widgets the company has to sell to be $x$. The total cost of materials is $0.5x$, because the cost of one widget is $0.5$ and we sell $x$ widgets. In addition, there\u2019s a one-time equipment fee of $\\$1000$. So the total cost is $$0.5x + 1000.$$ The company sells each widget at a price of $\\$2.75$, so the revenue is $$2.75x.$$ For the company to make a profit, it must make more money than it spends: \\begin{align*} 2.75x &> 0.5x + 1000 \\\\ 2.25x &> 1000 \\\\ \\frac{2.25x}{2.25} &> \\frac{1000}{2.25} \\\\ x &> \\frac{1000}{2.25} \\\\ x &> \\frac{1440}{3} \\\\ x &> 480. \\end{align*} Since the number of widgets the company has to sell must be a positive integer (you can\u2019t sell a fraction of a widget), it has to be at least 481. We can confirm this by looking at what happens if we make $x = 480$. The total revenue is then $\\$1320$, and the total cost is$\\$1200$, so there is still a loss. Then when $x = 481$, the total revenue is $\\$1386.25$and the total cost is$\\$1180$, so we make a profit. Therefore, the lowest number of widgets we can sell is\\boxed{481}$$.

        " Since the question wants the least number of widgets the company has to sell, we will focus on the break-even point first, which is the point where the profit is zero. At this point, let\u2019s assume the company has produced $n$ widgets.

        " Suppose it costs $n$ dollars to make $\\$x$ widgets. This means that $\\$0.50x$ is spent on the widgets. The profit would be $\\$2.75x$ minus the cost, so the total profit would be \\begin{align*} (\\2.75x \u2013 0.50x) \u2013 (1000+0.50x) &=\\302.25x-1000-0.50x\\3.25x-1000&=0&\\Rightarrow\\qquad3.25x&=1000\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad x &= \\frac{1000}{3.25}. \\end{align*}Therefore, we have$\\frac{1000}{3.25}$= $307.69\\$\\$.\nSo we need to at least sell $308$ widgets to break even.

        " If the company spends $\\$1000$ on one-time equipment fees, it will only start making money on each widget after spending an additional$0.50\\\\$by making the widget, so the company will break even when the difference between the cost of widgets and the revenue from them is zero, i.e., $0.50(w-1000)=2.75w-1000,$ where w is the number of widgets.  Solving for w gives us \\begin{align*} 0.50(w-1000)&=2.75w-1000\\\\ 0.50w-500&=2.75w-1000\\\\ 2.25w&=500\\qquad \\text{(adding 500 to both sides)}\\\\ w&=\\frac{500}{2.25}=\\frac{20000}{90}\\approx 222.22  \\end{align*} So the company will start breaking even at 222.22 widgets.  The question then asks what the least number of widgets the company has to sell in order to make a profit, which occurs when it sells 1 more than the break-even point, namely when it sells 223 widgets. In this case, it profits by an amount equal to $2.75$ times 223 minus 0.50 times 223 minus$1000, or $2.75(223)-0.50(223)-1000=\\$603.25,$ dollars.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 223 widgets. I hope it is correct.  This is the same as the minimum amount that it has to sell for the profit, so that answer is the least number of widgets that needs to be sold in order to make a profit.  To reach a profit, the company needs to sell \\boxed{223} widgets.

In order to make a profit, the number of units it sells must be sufficient to make up for the initial cost and then cover the cost. Now we can say that the number of widgets the company has to sell to make a profit, $n$, is given by $n\\ge\\frac{\\frac{P}{1}+\\$1000}{\\$0.25}.

This is shown in the picture below\nAs can be seen from the picture, the graph of $n(2.25)-1000$ is positive for $n>444\\frac{4}{9}$.

When we choose $n=2751$, our profit becomes nonzero, which means we have a profit. So any integer greater than \\[2749\\] would provide profit.

Thus, the total cost of each widget is $\\$0.50$.  Since the price of each widget is$\\$2.75$, we will make a profit of $\\$2.75-\\$0.50=\\$2.25$for each widget we make.

So$1000+bq=a$. To compute$b$, multiply both sides by$\\frac{1}{q}$: $1000+b=aq.$The breakeven point is when profit equals$0$; this happens when the cost of making widgets is equal to the one-time setup fee.

So$ b= $350\\ (b=  0.5), so the company\u2019s profit $P$ is equal to: $$P=q(2.75) - (1000 + 0.5q).$$  To find the number of widgets it sells at a loss, let$P = 0$and solve for$q$.  This will be the number of widgets it sells at a loss, since$P > 0$when$q > 121.5$and$P < 0$when$q < 121.5$becomes: $0 = 2.75q - 1000 - 0.5q.$  This implies $q = \\frac{2000}{2.25} = \\frac{8000}{9}$.  But since the company is paying$\\$0.50$ for each widget, it would be cheaper to not make any widgets at all!\nNow, the number of widgets $q$ needed to make a profit is the first time $P>0$, which is when $q > 121.5$.  To find $q$, set $P = 0$ and solve for $q$: $$0 = 2.75q - (1000 + 0.5q)$$ and then solve:\nSolution:Factor $(q-0.5)$ on the LHS and then move $100",
        " For the widgets the company makes, it is obvious that for $n$ widgets, it will cost $\\$0.50 \\cdot n$ dollars.  For $n$ widgets, it will earn$\\$2.75 \\cdot n$ dollars.  We are looking for the least value of $n$ such that the total income of $\\$2.75 n$ is greater than the total cost, which is$\\$ 1000 + 0.50 n.$  We need this inequality to hold for more than just one value of $n$; in particular, $2.75 n > 1000 + 0.5 n$ is another way to write this.  Solving for $n$ yields\n$2.25 n > 1000,$which gives us\n$\\boxed{n > \\frac{1000}{2.25} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 4}{4 \\cdot 2.25} = 400 \\approx 447.88}.$So we are looking for the least integer $n > 447.88,$ which is $\\boxed{448}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 448.
