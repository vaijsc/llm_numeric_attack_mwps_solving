If she made 48 free throws at her fifth practice, then 8x = 48.  So x = 6, which means that Jenny made 6 free throws at her first practice.  Therefore, Jenny made a free throw every other minute at her first practice.  (If she had tried to make a free throw every minute, she would have made 12 free throws at the first practice.)\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 6. I hope it is correct.EDIv Two Summit Points\nAt her first practice, Jenny made 6 free throws.\n#### Further questions:\nWhat tips will help her improve her free throw shooting percentage?\"\nProvided that Jenny will keep shooting more, her free throw shooting percentage will rise. At a higher volume of shots, she will get more comfortable, and her brain will get smarter about the approach and timing. Sometimes, simply taking more shots can improve accuracy. Here are a few further suggestions:\n1. **Practice under pressure**: Practice shooting with a defender, a shot clock, and limited time left on the game clock. This pressure will prepare her for real games.\n2. **Focus on **controlling her breathing**: Deep, slow breaths can help her relax and maintain a steady hand.\n3. **Visualize success**: Close her eyes, see the ball going in, and imagine the sound it makes as it goes through the net. Positive self-talk reinforces confidence.\n4. **Strengthen her core and legs**: Good shooting requires balance, leg strength, and core stability. \n5. **Film herself**: Record her shot and review it to identify and correct any flaws in her form or technique.\nWith consistent practice, rich fundamentals, and mental toughness, her free throw shooting percentage will likely improve.\nLet me know if you have more questions!#### Steps to increase Jenny's free throw shooting percentage:\n1. **Practice regularly**: Aim to practice shooting 3-5 times a week, for at least 30 minutes per session.\n2. **Warm-up and stretching**: Start with warm-up exercises and stretching to improve her flexibility and reduce fatigue.\n3.",

So we have:\nAt the second practice, Jenny made 2x free throws.\nAt the third practice, Jenny made 2(2x) = 4x free throws.\nAt the fourth practice, Jenny made 2(4x) = 8x free throws.\nAt the fifth practice, Jenny made 2(8x) = 16x free throws.\n### Step 2: Let\u2019s set up an equation\nAt the fifth practice, she made 48 free throws. Let\u2019s write an equation based on the numbers of free throws we found at each practice:\n16x = 48\n### Step 3: Solve for x\nWe can solve for x by dividing both sides by 16:\nx = 48 / 16\nx = 3\n### Step 4: Answer the question\nJenny made 3 free throws at the first practice.\n#### The correct answer is 3.

        " \nLet\u2019s call the number of free throws she made on the first practice x. Then we know she made twice the number on the second practice, so that\u2019s 2x. And for the third practice, twice the number of the second practice, so 2(2x) = 4x. And for the fourth practice, twice the number of the third practice, so 2(4x) = 8x. And for the fifth practice, twice the number of the fourth practice, so 2(8x) = 16x. Therefore, the sum of the free throws she made each practice is x + 2x + 4x + 8x + 16x. This sum equals 48 (the number of free throws she made at the fifth practice): x + 2x + 4x + 8x + 16x = 48.\nNow we can simplify this equation. Let\u2019s combine like terms on the left hand side. Notice that all the terms have an x, so we can take the common factor of x out, and then combine the coefficients: x(1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16) = 48. Then we can simplify the coefficient part, since it\u2019s easy to add up these numbers now: 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 31.\nNow we have: 31x = 48. To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 31: x = 48 / 31 = 1.55. But we know that x must be a whole number (Jenny made whole numbers of free throws at each practice), so we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 2. Therefore, the answer is 2.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2. I hope it is correct.### ",

        " At each basketball practice last week, Jenny made 48 / 2 = 24 free throws the practice before she made 48.  At her fourth practice, she made 24 / 2 = 12 free throws.  At her practice before that, she made 12 / 2 = 6 free throws.  At her second practice, she made 6 / 2 = 3 free throws.  At her first practice, Jenny made 3 free throws.\n#### Final Answer: The final answer is 3. I hope it is correct.### ",
        " The first question to ask is: How many free throws did she make at each of the other four practices?  We know that, since she made twice as many free throws at each practice as she did the last practice before, so it must be where she made twice that many at the previous practice, then twice that at the previous, and so on.  Like so:\nQuick Rough\n48 \u2022 (1/2) = 24\n24 \u2022 (1/2) = 12\n12 \u2022 (1/2) = 6\n6 \u2022 (1/2) = 3\n3\nSo 48, 24, 12, 6 and 3.\nNow that we have the sequence, how many did she make at the first practice?  Well, each number is half of the last number, which you can see.  You can see with numbers too. The method here is called the method of dividing by two. 12 is half of 24, 6 is half of 12, 3 is half of 6, and 1 - way is half of 3.  So: 3 \u2022 2 = 6, 6 \u2022 2 = 12, 12 \u2022 2 = 24, 24 \u2022 2 = 48 namely. That is how Ann received her free throw sequence from Ann\u2019s basketball practice. To calculate how many free throws she made at the first practice, you simply multiply 48 by 1/2 to find out. 48 \u2022 (1/2) = 24. Then you multiply 24 by 1/2 again to get \u2022 (1/2) = 12. Then multiply 12 by 1/2 to get \u2022 (1/2) = 6. Then multiply 6 by 1/2 to get \u2022 (1/2) = 3. Now multiply 3 by 2. 3 \u2022 2 = 6. 6 \u2022 2 = 12. 12 \u2022 2 = 24. 24 \u2022 2 = 48, so we find the first digit of 48 is.",
        "  Let\u2019s make a table.\n| Practice # | Free Throws made | Double of Previous | Free Throws Made at Previous Practice |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | F (first practice) | -- | -- |\n| 2 | 2F | F | F |\n| 3 | 4F | 2F | 2F |\n| 4 | 8F | 4F | 4F |\n| 5 | 48 | 8F | 8F |\nSince 48 is the free throws she made at the 5th practice, we know that 8F = 48. To get F, we divide 48 by 8. 48 / 8 is 6. So F, the free throws she made at the first practice, is 6.  Answer:  The answer is 6. #### I hope it is correct. ####  Let me know if you want me to explain further.  Thank you.  Good luck.  bye.  Jenny made twice as many free throws in each practice, except for the first practice, which we don\u2019t have a double for.  To find the number of free throws she made at the first practice (let\u2019s call that F), we can work backwards from the fifth practice. Since she made 48 free throws at the fifth practice, that\u2019s equal to 8 times the number of free throws she made at the previous practice (which would be 2 times the number of free throws at the practice before that, etc.).  This means that at the 4th practice, she made 8F free throws.  At the 3rd practice, she made 4F.  At the 2nd practice, she made 2F.  And at the 1st practice, she made F.  To get the number of free throws at the first practice, we use the fact that she made 48 free throws at the 5th practice, which is 8 times what she made at the 4th practice:$$8F=48$$Dividing both sides by 8,$$F=6$$So, Jenny made 6 free throws at the first practice.

        " At her first practice, she was not very good, so let\u2019s call that practice A.  At practice B, she still didn\u2019t quite get it together, so she only made X free throws. At practice C, she\u2019s making some progress and makes 2x free throws. At practice D, she\u2019s getting a bit better, so she makes 2(2x) = 4x. At practice E, she\u2019s now really focused and gets 2(4x) = 8x. And at her final practice, she\u2019s got it down pat and makes 2(8x) = 16x. We know that at practice E, she made 48 free throws, so we can set up the following equation:\n16x = 48",
        " This is a repeated multiplication question, which is a nice one.\n### Work:\nJenny made twice as many free throws at previous practice. That means last week practice 1, practice 2, practice 3, practice 4, practice 5, each one got bigger.\nLast week practice 5, is 48 free throws.\nWe will work backwards.

        " If she made twice as many free throws as she made the previous practice, this means that if x is the number of free throws she made at the first practice, 2x would be the number of free throws at the second, 2(2x) would be the number at the third, 2(2(2x)) would be the number at the fourth, and 2(2(2(2x))) would be the number at the fifth. At the fifth practice, she made 48 free throws. So, 2(2(2(2(x)))) = 48. We are asked to find x. This is because we know how many free throws she made at the fifth practice, but we want to know how many she made at the first practice. A strategy here is to begin by using parentheses. 2(2(2(2x))) = 2(2(8x)) = 2(16x) = 32x. Now we equate 32x with 48. 32x = 48. To solve for x, we divide both sides by 32. x = 48/32 = 3. Since x is the number of free throws Jenny made at the first practice, she made 3 free throws at the first practice.",
        " \nIf at the fifth practice, Jenny made 48 free throws, and at each practice, she made twice as many as at the previous practice, then the pattern is the following:\n[math] \\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \\hline 1st & 2nd & 3rd & 4th & 5th \\\\ \\hline x & 2x & 4x & 8x & 16x \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} [/math]\nThe 5th practice has 48 free throws. Then the 16x in the table stands for 48. To find the x, we need to divide the 48 by 16, which gives us 3. Therefore, the first practice had 3 free throws.  \n#### Explain\n",
