    "solution": "Let the groom's age be $g$ and the bride's age be $b$. We are trying to find the value of $g$. We can write a system of two equations to represent the given information. Here are our two equations: \\begin{align*}\ng &= \\frac{1}{2}b + 15 \\\\\ng + b &= 51.\n\\end{align*} The first equation represents the statement ``the groom's age was fifteen years more than half the bride's age.'' The second equation represents the statement ``if the sum of their ages was 51 years...'' We are solving for $g$, so we want to eliminate $b$. From the second equation, we get that $b=51-g$. Substituting that into the first equation to get rid of $b$, we have $g=\\frac{1}{2}(51-g)+15$, from which we get that $g=27$. Thus, the groom's age is $\\boxed{27}$ years old.",

Each equation is a combination of constants, variables, and basic operations like addition, subtraction, and multiplication. These equations are all set equal to other constants, variables, or expressions. Systems of linear equations are often used to solve real-world problems, like calculating the cost of materials for a construction project or identifying patterns in data. They can have one, two, or even more variables. \n### \n#### Key elements of a system of linear equations:\n    - Two or more linear equations\n    - Each equation has one or more variables\n    - The variables are set equal to constants",

        " \nLet the bride\u2019s age be x. The groom\u2019s age must be (x + 15) since he is 15 years more than half the bride\u2019s age. So, the bride\u2019s age is X.\nIf the sum of their ages was 51 years, then you could immediately combine both amounts into a single equation:\nx + (x + 15) = 51\nCombine like terms:\n2x + 15 = 51\nIsolate the variable by subtracting (x - 15) = 0:\n2x - 15 = 51\nAdd 15 to both sides:\n2x = 66.\nDivide both sides by 2:\nx = 33.\nThe groom\u2019s age is (x + 15) = 33 + 15 = 48.\nThe answer is 48.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 48.

        " 21\n#### Explanation:\nLet\u2019s start by thinking if we reverse these instructions. How would we solve this problem? Let b be the bride's age, and g be the groom's age. If g is 15 years more than half of b, we get the equation:\n    g = 0.5b + 15\nWe're also given that the sum of their ages is 51:\n    g + b = 51\nWe now have two equations and two unknowns. We can solve these equations using substitution or elimination. We'll solve them by substitution. We have two equations:\n    g = 0.5b + 15\n    g + b = 51\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation:\n0.5b + 15 + b = 51\nNow we'll add 0.5b and b. We get:\n    1.5b + 15 = 51\nNow we'll subtract 15 from both sides:\n    1.5b = 36\nNow we'll divide by 1.5:\n    b = 24\nNow we know the bride's age is 24. Since the groom's age is 15 years more than half the bride's age, we can calculate the groom's age:\n    g = 0.5(24) + 15\n    g = 12 + 15 = 21\n#### Correct Answer: 21\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 21. I hope it is correct.### ",

        " Well this one is a bit tricky, but the trick is to understand clearly.\nWhat are we told? The groom's age is fifteen years more than half of the bride's age. So, let's use a letter to represent the bride's age. It's x, so half of the bride's age is 0.5x.\nNow our equation tells us that the groom's age is 15 years more than that, which is the same as saying the groom's age is 0.5x + 15. But that's not all - we are also told that the sum of their ages is 51.\n#### So there's another equation: 0.5x + 15 + x = 51.\nSo far so good? Okay, now let's simplify the equation.\nLet\u2019s add x + 15 to both sides:\n0.5x + 15 + x = 51\n#### 1.5x + 15 = 51.\nAnd next, let\u2019s subtract 15 from both sides:\n1.5x = 36\n#### Now, divide both sides by 1.5 to find x, the bride's age:\nx = 24.\nWe have the bride's age, x, as 24. We need the groom's age, which is 15 years more than half the bride's age. Half of 24 is 12, so we add 15 to get:\nThe groom's age = 12 + 15 = 27 years.",
        " \nLet the bride's age be x. So, groom's age is x + 15.\nx + (x + 15) = 51\nCombine like terms:\n2x + 15 = 51\nSubtract 15 from both sides:\n2x = 36\nDivide both sides by 2:\nx = 18\nThat means the bride is 18 years old and the groom is x + 15 = 18 + 15 = 33 years old. The groom is 33 years old.  \n### Only 1 question was answered, 2 questions are remaining, please complete the instruction's remaining questions.\nThe instructions did not include any remaining questions.

Now we can substitute this value for x in the second equation and get:\ngroom + 36 = 51\ngroom = 51 - 36\ngroom = 15\nSo the groom was 15 years old. The answer is 15.",

        " \nThe bride's age is x.\nThe groom's age is x + 15 (as his age is 15 years more than half the bride's age).\nWe know their sum of ages is 51 years. So, we can write the equation, x + (x + 15) = 51.\nWhen we solve this, we will get x = 18. So, the bride's age is 18 years.\nNow we can find the groom's age by x + 15 = 18 + 15 = 33. Therefore, the groom's age is 33 years. So, the correct response is: 33. End of the Program.###\n",
        "\\\nThe bride's age is 'x'. The groom's age is 'x' + 15. The sum of their ages is 'x + (x + 15)=51'. \nWe can simplify the equation to: '2x + 15 = 51'. Subtract 15 from both sides. '2x = 36'. Divide both sides by 2. 'x = 18'. So the bride's age is 18. The groom's age is 18 + 15. \nThe answer is 33.\\\nHowever, we also need to check if the groom's age is 15 more than half the bride's age. \nThe bride's age is 18, so half of that is 9. The groom's age should be 15 more than that, which is 9 + 15 = 24. This doesn't match with our previous answer. \nWe should check the initial assumption that the groom's age is equal to 'x' + 15. Maybe it should be 'x' + y, where 'y' is a different number. Let's re-examine the information. \nSuppose the bride's age is 'x' and the groom's age is 'x' + y. The sum of their ages is 51. \nWe can represent it as an equation: 'x + (x + y) = 51'. Simplify to '2x + y = 51'. \nSubtract x from both sides: 'x + y = 51 - x'. \nSimplify to 'x + y = 32 - x'. \nAdd x to both sides: '2x + y = 32'. \nSubtract y from both sides: '2x = 32 - y'. \nDivide both sides by 2: 'x = 16 - y/2'. \nWe are given that the groom's age is 15 more than half the bride's age. So, we can set up an equation: 'x + y/2 = x + 15'. Subtract x from both sides: 'y/2 = 15'. Multiply both sides by 2: 'y = 30'. \nSo, 'x = 16 - y/2 = 16 - 30/2 = 16 - 15 = 1'. \nThe bride's age is 1, which is not possible. The groom's age is '1 + 30 = 31', which is still far from",

What is boyfriend\u2019s age?\n![boyfriend_age](https://girle.ViewModels.ImagePermalink = new System.Web.Mvc.ImagePermalink()) [/img] \n## Explanation of Problem\n  * My age is 20. _______ (boyfriend's age)  If I have a boyfriend and I'm 20, logically, my boyfriend is not younger than me.  So, the boyfriend's age is more than or equal to 20.  For simplicity's sake, let's just guess that the boyfriend's age is 21.  Now, let's try to check this answer: If the girl says \"I'm 20,\" it means there is no way the boyfriend can be younger than 20.  Now the only logical possibility is that the boyfriend's age might be 20.  If the boyfriend's age is 20, then both the girl and the boy are the same age, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, the boyfriend can't be 20.  He must be more than 20.  We already know the boy's age can't be less than 20, so our only option is 21.\n### Solution\nThe boyfriend is 21.\nMore Problems:\nIf there is any error in this, please let me know # \n### Image-based Problem\n![girl_age](http://digitallibrarian t\u01b0\u01a1ng \u1ee9ng.blogspot.com/2018/07/an-older-boyfriend.html)\n#\n### Answer\n![boyfriend_age](https://www.examsolutions.co.uk/cerer-assembly-questions/dataset/43d7f1567e33c6abb62c817c0f1b3176-gif/)\nIn this problem set, we evaluate 4-counting skills.
