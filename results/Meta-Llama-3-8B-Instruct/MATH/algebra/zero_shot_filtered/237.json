First, we can group the terms like this:\n$100 + (1+2+3 + \\cdots + 98) + (99).$\nLet\u2019s think about each part of this equation. Firstly, $100$ is easy \u2013 we just need to add $100$ to our answer.\nNext, we need to find the sum of $1+2+3+\\cdots+98.$\nThis is an arithmetic series, where each term is the one before, plus 1. We can use the formula for an arithmetic series, like this:\n$100+99+\\cdots+1=(1+100)\\cdot 50=\\frac{101(100)}{2}=5050.$\nFinally, we just need to add the last term, $99$.\nSo, we\u2019ve got:\n$100+5050+99=\\boxed{5050}.$\nDon\u2019t worry if you didn\u2019t get it at first.

If we pair 1 with 100, 2 with 99, 3 with 98, etc., then we will be left with just 50 and not 100.  This is why the quantity will be divided by 2.  The quantity $n$ is 100, so the sum will be $\\frac{100\\cdot101}{2}$, which is equal to 5050.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 5050.

        " <think aloud>\nFirst, I am going to look at how many terms there are: $100$ terms. Or, more conveniently, $1 + 2 + 3 + \\cdots + 98 + 99 + 100 = \\sum_{i=1}^{100}i.$\nNow, I can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{100}i = \\frac{100(101)}{2}=\\boxed{5050}.$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 5050. I hope it is correct.  The formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is $\\frac{n(a_1 + a_n)}{2}$, where $n$ is the number of terms, $a_1$ is the first term, and $a_n$ is the $n$-th term.  In this case, $n=100$, $a_1=1$, and $a_n=100$.  Plugging these in, you get $\\frac{100(101)}{2} = \\boxed{5050}.$\n### ",
        " $5050$\nOkay! For the above problem, we can rephrase the question by noticing that there is an equal number of both positive and negative integers. Using the rule $a + (-a) = 0$, we have that $1 + 2 + 3 + \\cdots + 98 + 99 + 100 = (1 - 1) + (2 - 2) + \\cdots + (50 - 50) + (99 + 1)$. Let\u2019s multiply this expression with 2. We have $2[(1 - 1) + (2 - 2) + \\cdots + (50 - 50) + (99 + 1)]$. Using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence, which is $n \\cdot \\left(\\frac{a_1 + a_n}{2}\\right)$, where $a_1$ is the first term and $a_n$ is the last term of the sequence, we have that the arithmetic sequence of integers $1$ to $50$ has a sum of $\\frac{(1 + 50)}{2} \\cdot 50 = 25 \\cdot 51$. The arithmetic sequence of integers $99$ and $100$ also has a sum of $\\frac{(99 + 100)}{2} \\cdot 2 = 100 \\cdot 1 = 100$. Therefore, the expression becomes $2[(101) + (51) + (100)]$. This is equal to $254$. Next, we divide by $2$ to get the desired result, $\\boxed{5050}$.",
        " 1 + 2 + 3 + \\cdots + 98 + 99 + 100 = \\boxed{5050}\nLet\u2019s first think of just adding all of the numbers without a formula. We shall add\n$1+99=100,$\n$2+98=100,$\n$3+97=100,$\n$4+96=100,$\n$\\vdots$\n$48+52=100,$\n$\\cdots\\cdots$\n$99+1=100.$\nAdding 50 times 100 in this way yields $50\\times 100 = 5000.$ We also know that a sequence of consecutive integers can be summed using the formula\n$1+2+3+\\cdots +99+100 = \\frac{(1+100)(100)}{2}$\nwhich gives the sum $\\boxed{5050}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 5050.

Please, Let me know if you need anything more.\nSolution:\nWe know\n$1+2+3+\\cdots +99+100 = \\frac{(1+100)(100)}{2}$\nwhich gives the sum $\\boxed{5050}.$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 5050.

The average of $50$ is, of course, $50.0$.\nWith so many pairs with averages at $50.5$, we can see that the quantity we want is the sum of all these averages, which is:\n$(50.5+50.5+\\cdots50.5+50.0) = 50.5(99) + 50 = \\frac{100\\times101}{2} = \\boxed{5050}$\nThis is often referred to as the formula for the sum of the first $n$ positive integers, given by $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$\n### ",
