We can set up a system of two equations to represent the given information, as follows:\n\n\\begin{align*}\ng &= 8a \\\\\ng-a &= 56 \\\\\n\\end{align*}In particular, the second equation represents the grandfather's age $a$ years ago, when Andrew was born. To solve for $a$, we need to eliminate $g$ from the equations above. Substituting the first equation into the second to eliminate $g$, we get that $8a-a=56$ or $a=8$. Thus, Andrew is $\\boxed{8}$ years old now.",

        "Let's denote Andrew's current age as \\( A \\) and his grandfather's current age as \\( G \\).\nFrom the problem, we have two key pieces of information:\n1. Andrew's grandfather's age is eight times Andrew's age:\n   \\[\n   G = 8A\n   \\]\n2. Andrew's grandfather was 56 years old when Andrew was born. This means the age difference between Andrew and his grandfather is 56 years. Thus, we can express the grandfather's age in terms of Andrew's age:\n   \\[\n   G = A + 56\n   \\]\nNow we have two equations:\n1. \\( G = 8A \\)\n2. \\( G = A + 56 \\)\nSince both expressions equal \\( G \\), we can set them equal to each other:\n\\[\n8A = A + 56\n\\]\nNext, we solve for \\( A \\). First, subtract \\( A \\) from both sides:\n\\[\n8A - A = 56\n\\]\n\\[\n7A = 56\n\\]\nNow, divide both sides by 7:\n\\[\nA = \\frac{56}{7} = 8\n\\]\nThus, Andrew is currently \\( \\mathbf{8} \\) years old.\nTo find Andrew's grandfather's age, we can substitute \\( A \\) back into one of the equations:\n\\[\nG = 8A = 8 \\times 8 = 64\n\\]\nSo, Andrew's grandfather is \\( 64 \\) years old.\nTo summarize:\n- Andrew's current age \\( A = 8 \\) years.\n- His grandfather's current age is \\( 64 \\) years.\nThus, the answer is that Andrew is \\( \\boxed{8} \\) years old.",

        " Andrew's grandfather is 56 years old when Andrew was born. This means that at his birth, Andrew is zero years old.\n#### Step 1: Set up the relationship\nWe can think about this problem algebraically by setting up the equation:\na = A/8\nwhere a is Andrew\u2019s grandfather\u2019s age and A is Andrew's age.\n#### Step 2: Apply the information\nNow we know that when Andrew is 0 years old, his grandfather is 56 years old. We can substitute these values into the equation and solve for A.\n0 = 56/8\n0 = 7\nThis equation is precisely true, as Andrew is indeed 0 years old when his grandfather is 56 years old.\n#### Step 3: Determine the answer\nNow that we know Andrew's age when his grandfather was 56, we can find his current age. If Andrew was 0 years old when his grandfather was 56, this means that when he was born, his grandfather was 56. When he turns 1, his grandfather turns 57. When he turns 2, his grandfather turns 58, and so on.\n#### Step 4: Find the missing years\nTo find Andrew's current age, we just have to add the missing years. Since Andrew is still alive, he must have turned at least 1 year old (at least one year has passed). This means his grandfather must have turned at least 57 years old. And so on. Therefore, Andrew could be anywhere from 1 year old to 56 years old.\n#### Step 5: Find the answer\nLet the current age of Andrew be A. Since his grandfather is eight times his age, his grandfather's current age is 8A.\n#### Step 6: Solve for A\nSubtracting his age when his grandfather was 56 (0) from his current age, we finally get:\nA - 0 = A\nA = 7\n#### Step 7: Find the answer\nSo Andrew is 7 years old. His grandfather is 8A = 8 * 7 = 56 years old.",

To do that, we subtract x from both sides:\n8x = 56 + x - x\nThe equation simplifies to:\n8x = 56\nNow, we can divide both sides by 8:\nx = 56/8\nx = 7\nThat means Andrew is currently 7 years old.\n### Final Answer: The final answer is 7. I hope it is correct.",
        " Let G be Andrew\u2019s grandfather\u2019s age now and A be Andrew\u2019s age now. From the problem statement, we know that G = 8A. From the problem description, we also know that when Andrew was born, G was 56 years old. So G - 56 is Andrew\u2019s age. Then we have G - 56 = A. We can substitute G = 8A into the last equation. We now have 8A - 56 = A. This simplifies to 7A = 56. So A = 56 / 7 = 8. Thus, Andrew is currently 8 years old. The answer is 8. ",
        " \nLet Andrew's current age be A. \nThen, Andrew's grandfather's current age is 8A.\nAndrew's grandfather was 56 years old when Andrew was born, so before Andrew was born, Andrew's grandfather was 56 years old.\nNow, Andrew's grandfather has aged A years, so Andrew's grandfather's current age is 56 + A.\nSince Andrew's grandfather's current age is 8A, we can write 56 + A = 8A.\nNow, subtract 56 from both sides. \nA = 7A\nNow, subtract A from both sides.\nA = 56. \nSo, Andrew is currently 56 years old. \n### Sample ",

        " Let\u2019s start by saying A is Andrew's age when he was born. Since Andrew's age at birth is A, his age now will be A + the number of years that passed. Grandma's age when Andrew was born is 56. Grandma's age now will be (A + years) + (A + years).\n### Because grandma's age now is eight times Andrew's age now, the expression (A + years) + (A + years) is equal to 8(A + years).\n20### Since both ages are expressed in years from birth, we can set up the equation  A + years = 8(A + years).\n#### Next, we can solve for A:",
        " \nAndrew's grandfather's age is eight times Andrew's age. If Andrew's grandfather was 56 years old when Andrew was born, let's call Andrew's age when he was born \"a\". So, grandfather's age was 56. It means that Andrew's grandfather's age in general is 8 * a. If grandfather's age is 8 * a and 56 when Andrew was born, that means when Andrew was born, a = 7. So, Andrew's age is constantly equal to 7. Now, if grandfather's age is 8 * a and Andrew's grandfather was 56 when Andrew was born, that means that the age of Andrew's grandfather is 56 + 7 = 63. Finally, Andrew's age is 7 years. That's the answer. The answer is 7. whenever Andrew age is increasing after every year then age of grandfather is increasing by eight times of increase of andrew's age if we are not correct then else please go ahead . \n### Brain Blink:\nLook at the end of the problem in middle of blank after 56 years and again there in the end\n### ",

        "  Let Andrew's age now be A, and we can write down the statement we are given as eight times this age will be the age of Andrew's grandfather. [Stem][You can write it as an equation and solve for A.]\nA = Andrew's age right now\n8 * A = Age of Andrew's grandfather right now\nWe know that when Andrew was born, his grandfather's age was 56. So, to get the current age, we need to add the number of years that have passed since Andrew was born.\nCurrent age of Andrew's grandfather = 56 + the number of years since Andrew was born\nThe age of the grandfather is eight times Andrew's age, so to set up an equation, we need to write that as:\n8A = 56 + years since Andrew was born + A\nWe can simplify this by subtracting A from both sides to leave the number of years since Andrew was born. [Apply the formula.]\n8A - A = 56 + years since Andrew was born\n7A = 56 + years since Andrew was born\nWe don't know the number of years since Andrew was born, but that is the part we want to find. We can take everything except the unknown to one side:\n7A - 56 = years since Andrew was born\nSo, now we're looking for the years since Andrew was born. The way we can find this is by asking another question: How many years have passed since Andrew was born? He is Andrew's age right now, so that is the number of years.\nSince we know Andrew's current age, we can write this as:\nyears since Andrew was born = A\nNow we can plug A in the equation:\n7A - 56 = A\nWe can simplify this further by subtracting 7A from both sides:\n-6A = -56\nNow we can solve for A: [Solve A.]\nA = 56 / 6\nA = 9\nAndrew is currently 9 years old.
