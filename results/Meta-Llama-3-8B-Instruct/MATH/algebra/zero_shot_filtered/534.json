        "  $80$ questions.\n### Final Answer: The final answer is 72. I hope it is correct. Let $c$ be the number of questions Frank answered correctly.  Then $c$ is also the number of questions he scored at least $5$ points on.  Now each of these questions scored $5$ points, so Frank scored $5c$ points on these questions.  Each incorrect answer scored $-2$ points, so Frank scored $-2(80-c)$ points on these questions.  Finally, each one of the remaining $100-80 = 20$ questions not answered scored zero points.  Thus we have that \\begin{align*} 5c - 2(80-c) + 0&=232\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad 5c - 160 + 2c&=232\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad 7c&=392\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad c&=\\boxed{56}. \\end{align*}\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 56. I hope it is correct. Although the question asked for $c$, the answer is not $56$, but rather $\\boxed{72}$.  To see why, let $w$ be the number of questions Frank did not answer.  Then $80$ is the number of questions Frank answered, and $c$ is the number of questions Frank answered correctly.  Therefore, $w=80-c$, and we can convert $c$ to the number of points scored, $s$: \\begin{align*} s&=5c - 2(80-c)\\\\ &=5c - 160 + 2c\\\\ &=7c - 160\\\\ &=392\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad c&=\\boxed{80+160/7 = 72}. \\end{align*} .

We are looking for the number of incorrect answers, let\u2019s call it$i\\$.

First, we will solve for $i$:\n$c+i+n=100$\n$c+i+100-c=100$\n$i=100-c$.\nSubstitute this expression for $i$ into the second equation:\n$5c-2(100-c)=232$\n$5c-200+2c=232$\n$7c=232+200$\n$7c=432$\n$c=432/7$\n$c=61\\frac{5}{7}$.\nHowever, this number is not integer. That means we need to re think about this problem. We can notice that $c$ should be less than $80$, and also $c+i\\le 80$ because Frank didn\u2019t answer more than $80$ questions.\nAt least one question was not answered. But Frank didn\u2019t answer $80$ questions, which means $n>0$. However, we cannot find $n$ directly.",

Let\u2019s break down this question: A number of questions for 5 points is ? , A number of questions for -2 points is ? , A number of questions for 0 points is ? (: as we don\u2019t know what kind of question they are, just for simplicity let\u2019s think like this). And now Frank got totally 232 points: 5 \u00d7 ? + (-2) \u00d7 ? + 0 \u00d7 ? = 232 So let\u2019s find ? : 5 \u00d7 ? + (-2) \u00d7 ? = 232 (from here you will get ? )$$\n    $$Firstly we can easily calculate the amount of points by the correct questions( \\because 5 points )$$5 \u00d7 ? = 232 \u2013 ? \u00d7 -2 = 232 + 2?

Step 2: Frank answered a total of $80$ questions, so the number of questions he answered incorrectly or didn\u2019t answer is $80 - X$.\nStep 3: Each incorrect answer scores $-2$ points.  Thus, for $80 - X$ questions, Frank lost a total of $-2(80 - X)$ points.

        " Since Frank answered 80 questions, we know $80$ of the 100 questions were either answered correctly or incorrectly answered. Let $n$ denote the number of questions answered incorrectly. Therefore, there are $100 \u2013 80 = 20$ questions not answered. Now let\u2019s consider his score. If $c$ is the number of correct answers, he scored $5c$ for these questions. However, he answered $n$ questions incorrectly, and each of these cost $-2$ points, resulting in a loss of $-2n$ points. Also, the 20 questions he didn\u2019t answer gave him no points. Therefore, his score, $5c - 2n$, must equal to $232$, his total score. \\begin{align*}\n5c-2n &= 232 \\\\\nc &= 48 + n\n\\end{align*} Since each incorrect answer scored $-2$ points and his total score is 232, we know that $-2n \\leq 232$, so $n \\leq 116$, but since Frank answered 80 questions, he can\u2019t answer more than 80 questions incorrectly, i.e., $n \\leq 80$. Therefore, $48 \\leq c \\leq 80$. As it is not possible to have a negative number of correct answers, the correct answer must be $80$.",
        " We first determine the number of questions that Frank answered correctly. Let $x$ be the number of questions that he answered correctly.\n### First part:\nWe know that correct answers score 5 points each. In total, Frank scored 232 points. So the sum of the points from all correct answers must be 232.\n### Second part:\nThere are 80 total questions. Correct answers score 5 points, incorrect answers score -2 points, and unanswered questions or skipped questions score 0 points. If $x$ is the number of questions that he answered correctly, then the number of questions that he answered incorrectly is $80 - x$, and the number of questions that he did not answer will be $100 - 80 = 20 - (x + 80 - x) = 20$, since he must answer some number of questions. The points from correct answers are $5x$, the points from incorrect answers are $-2(80-x)$, and the points from unanswered questions are 0. Almost there...\n### Last part:\nBy the problem, the total sum of points is 232. So we have: $$5x - 2(80-x) = 232$$\nNow, we solve this equation: $$5x - 160 + 2x = 232$$\n$$7x = 392$$ $\\boxed{x = 56}$ questions answered correctly.\n#### END\nNow, we can find the number of questions he answered incorrectly by subtracting the number of questions he answered correctly from the total number of questions.

        " ^{1}\nFrank scored 232 points. Frank answered 80 questions. Since each correct answer is +5 and each incorrect answer is -2, Frank must have answered at least 80/5=16 questions correctly. Try out some negative answers, we find that the final answer is $\\boxed{92}$. So Frank got 92 questions correctly.\n### A better way to answer\nLet $c$ represent the number of correct answers, and $i$ represent the number of incorrect answers. Then $c+i=80$. It is also known that $5c-2i=232$, because these two expressions are related to the total score, each correct answer adds 5 points, and each incorrect answer subtracts 2 points. We can solve for $c$ using substitution. First, substitute $80-i$ for $c$ in the second equation:\n$$5(80-i)-2i=232$$\n$$400-5i-2i=232$$\n$$400-7i=232$$\n$$7i=168$$\n$$i=24.$$ It is known that $c+i=80$, so let's substitute $24$ for $i$:\n$$c+24=80$$\n$$c=56.$$ Therefore, Frank got 56 questions correct, and hence 56+24-80=0 questions incorrect. The correct answer is $\\boxed{56}$.\n## References:\n* This problem is found on Brilliant ({ Brilliant.org ) and title is \"Frank's Test Scores\".\n* The problem appears in AoPS AMC10 problems ({artofproblemsolving.com )}.

        " \nWe know the 80 questions will score 0 point if they are left un-answered. Otherwise, each question has a score of either +5 or -2.  That means the 200 more points scored will be  the sum of 5x and (-2)(20-x) by letting x be the number of questions answered correctly. We know 80 questions answers, so the numbers of incorrect question is 20-x. Thus, the sum of the score of the 80 questions is equal to 5x -20x = 80. So the remaining 200 points is equal to 5x + 40 -2x = 3x + 40. Therefore, 3x+40 = 200 gives us x = 60, which means the number of question answered correctly is 60.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 60. I hope it is correct.",
        " Let $C$ be the number of questions that Frank answered correctly. Let $I$ be the number of questions that Frank answered incorrectly. Therefore, $C+I=80$, or in other words, $I=80-C$. The number of points Frank scored is $5C-2I$, so $232 = 5C-2(80-C)$. By combining like terms and solving for $C$,\n\\begin{align*}\n232&=5C-2(80-C)\\\\\n232&=5C-160+2C\\\\\n232&=7C-160\\\\\n7C&=392\\\\\nC&=56.\n\\end{align*}\nSo Frank answered $\\boxed{56}$ questions correctly.\n### Review:\n1.  Identify the unknown and define variables. In this case, we need to find the number of questions Frank answered correctly. Define variables $C$ for the number of questions that Frank answered correctly, and $I$ for the number of questions that Frank answered incorrectly.\n2.  Express the relationships between the variables. Since Frank answered $80$ questions in total, we can set up an equation: $C+I=80$. This equation tells us that the number of correct answers plus the number of incorrect answers equals $80$.\n3.  Calculate the number of questions that Frank answered incorrectly. By solving the equation $C+I=80$ for $I$, we get $I=80-C$. Now we know how to find the number of questions Frank answered incorrectly given the number of questions he answered correctly.\n4.  Express the number of points Frank scored. Since each correct answer scores $5$ points, each incorrect answer scores $-2$ points, and each question not answered scores zero points, the number of points Frank scored is $5C-2I$.\n5.  Set up and solve the equation. Substitute the expression for $I$ in terms of $C$ from step 3 into the expression for the number of points Frank scored in step 4 and solve for $C$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 56. I hope it is correct. ",
        " Let\u2019s look at the scoring system first. Frank scores 5 points for every correct answer, -2 points for every incorrect answer, and 0 points for every unanswered question.\nSince Frank answered 80 questions, there were 80 opportunities for him to score 5 points for every correct answer, -2 points for every incorrect answer, and 0 points for every unanswered question.\nWe are given that Frank scored a total amount of 232 points. Let\u2019s break it down. (share)\nHe scored 5 points for every correct answer, so let\u2019s suppose he scored a total of x correct answers.\nHe scored -2 points for every incorrect answer, so let\u2019s suppose he scored a total of y incorrect answers.\nWe are trying to find out how many questions Frank answered correctly, so it\u2019s x.\nSince he scored x correct answers, he scored 5x points for the correct answers. Since he scored y incorrect answers, he scored -2y points for the incorrect answers.\nFrank answered a total of 80 questions. He scored x correct answers, so the remaining unanswered answers are 80 \u2013 x unanswered questions.\nNow let\u2019s write up a system of equations.\n# of correct answers (x) + # of incorrect answers (y) + unanswered answers (80 - x) = Total questions (100)\nx + y + (80 - x) = 100\nSimplify the equation to get\nx + y = 20\nNow let\u2019s figure out how much points he scored in total.\n5x - 2y = Total points (232)\nWe can substitute the x and y we got from the previous system of equations. Substitute x = 20 \u2013 y to get\n5 * (20 - y) - 2y = 232\nSolve for y. y = 2\nNow let\u2019s substitute y = 2 to find x.\n20 - y = 20 \u2013 2 = 18\nSo Frank scored 18 correct answers and scored 232 points.\n### Conclusion:\nThus, Frank answered $$18$$ questions correctly.\nWe can also just evaluate the function 5x - 2y to find x.\nSince 5x - 2y = 232, then\nx = $\\frac{232 + 2y}{5}$\n= $\\frac{232 + 2*2}{5}$\n= $\\frac{232 + 4}{5}$\n= $\\frac{236}{5}$\n= $\\boxed{18}$\nFinal Answer:"
