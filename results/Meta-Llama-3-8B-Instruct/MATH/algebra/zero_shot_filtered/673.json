The problem tells me that a snak-size tin of peaches, with 40 calories, is 2% of a person's daily caloric requirement. In other words, 2 out of every 100 calories required daily consumes 40 of those calories, so 2% is 40. It's like 40/2 = 100. To find 100%, we need to multiply the 40 by 100/2. That is, n = (40) * (100/2) = (40) * (50) = 2000. So n is equal to 2000. I hope this makes sense. 2022-03-22 22:02:31 \u2013\u00a0JohnP8  We know that 2% of $n$ is 40. So 0.02n=40.

        " 1. $\\frac{40}{100}=0.4$ We need to identify the value of x (total daily caloric requirement). You multiply $0.4$ and x to get 40.\n### 2. $0.4x=40$ You divide both sides by $0.4$, which means $x=40/0.4=x=1000$\n###  Final Answer: The final answer is 1000. I hope it is correct. \n---\nSolution:\nIn this problem, we are given that a snack-size tin of peaches contains 40 calories and it is 2% of the daily caloric requirement. We need to find the total daily caloric requirement. We can set up this problem using the following proportion:\n2% = 40/x\nWhere x is the total daily caloric requirement.\n0.02 = 40/x\nTo solve for x, we multiply both sides of the equation by x:\n0.02x = 40\nTo find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.02:\nx = 40 / 0.02\nx = 2000\nSo, the total daily caloric requirement is 2000 calories.\nSo the final answer is 2000. I hope it is correct. \nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2000. I hope it is correct.  $$\n---\nCalculator Method: Press the \"Solve for X\" button, and you'll find the answer.\nType: `0.02x=40` and you'll get:\nX = 2000\nSo, the total daily caloric requirement is 2000 calories. \nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2000. I hope it is correct.  $$\n---\nDon't forget to clean up your calculators after using it!\nWhether it's through a digital calculator or solving the math problem manually, arriving at the correct answer is the key!\nSo, what do you think?

Please check.\nIf a snack-size tin of peaches has 40 calories and is 2% of a person's daily caloric requirement, the person's daily caloric requirement is $\\frac{40}{0.02} = 2000$ calories. So the answer is 2000 calories. Indeed, we are using the equation $y = \\frac{1}{0.02}x$. The 40 calories represent 2% of the 2000 calories. 0.02 represents 2%, so we multiply by $\\frac{1}{0.02} = \\frac{100}{2} = 50$ to get 2000 calories.\nSubstituting $x = 2000$ into the first equation gives $\\boxed{y = 2000}$.

There are 2000 calories fulfill a person's daily caloric requirement.  If a snack-size tin of peaches has 40 cacories and is 2% of a person's daily caloric requirement, how many calories fulfill a person's daily caloric requirement?  The number of calories that satisfy a person's daily caloric requirement is x.  We set up the equation that expresses 2% of x as 40.  Let us solve the equation.  2% of x is the same as \\$frac{2}{100}$x.  2\\% of x is 40, so we have this equation: \\begin{align*} \\Large{\\left(\\frac{2}{100}\\right)x = 40} \\end{align*}  We can rearrange the equation by dividing both sides by$\\Large{\\frac{2}{100}}$: \\begin{align*} \\Large{\\frac{x}{50} = 40} \\end{align*}  Multiplying both sides by50:\\begin{align*}\\Large{x = 40 \\times 50}\\end{align*}  And if we solve forx:\\begin{align*}x = 2000\\end{align*}So, the number of calories that satisfy a person's daily caloric requirement is 2000.
