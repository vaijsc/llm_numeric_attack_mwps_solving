The time complexity is O(1) because the algorithm involves a constant number of operations. The space complexity is O(1) because the algorithm uses a constant amount of space to store the intermediate results.  ### Edge cases: The algorithm will work correctly for any integer input. However, if the input is not an integer, the algorithm may produce incorrect results. In this case, the edge case would be if the input were a non-integer, resulting in an error or incorrect output. The algorithm will also work correctly regardless of the size of the input integer. However, if the input integer is extremely large, the algorithm may take a long time to complete or may not be able to produce the correct result due to limitations in the programming language or computer architecture.  ### Real-world application: Computing squares of integers is a common operation in many real-world applications, such as finance, science, and engineering. For example, in finance, computing the square of a stock price or a bond yield is used to compute the value of an investment or a portfolio. In science, computing squares of distances or velocities is used to compute physical quantities such as kinetic energy or work done. In engineering, computing squares of forces or moments is used",

Multiply 989 by itself.\n**989 \u00d7 989 = ?**\nTo multiply two numbers, you have to multiply each digit of the first number by each digit of the second number and then add them up.\nLet us multiply:\n**900 \u00d7 989 = ???**\nTo multiply, you have to multiply each digit of 900 by each digit of 989:\n* 900 \u00d7 900 = 810,000\n* 900 \u00d7 90 = 81,000\n* 900 \u00d7 9 = 8,100\nNow, add up the products:\n810,000 + 81,000 + 8,100 = 899,100\n**90 \u00d7 989 = ???**\nAgain, multiply each digit of 90 by each digit of 989:\n* 90 \u00d7 900 = 81,000\n* 90 \u00d7 90 = 8,100\n* 90 \u00d7 9 = 810\nNow, add up the products:\n81,000 + 8,100 + 810 = 89,910\nFinally, add the results:\n899,100 + 89,910 = 988,010\nSo, 989 squared is equal to **988,010**. Wow, you now know how to square 989 without a calculator!",
        " \nWe can break down this problem into smaller, manageable parts. We'll do this by adding some zeroes, multiplying the result, and then doing some more manipulation.\n**Step 1: Break down the number**\n989 = 980 + 9\n**Step 2: Calculate the square of 980**\n980^2 = 980000 \n**Step 3: Calculate the square of 9**\n9^2 = 81 \n**Step 4: Add the two intermediate values together**\n980000 + 81 = 980081 \nSo, without a calculator, we can compute the square of 989 as **989^2 = 980081**. Convenient? Maybe!precedented? Not at all! Did we hit the limit? No! That\u2019s for later... Much later! \ud83d\ude04\n### Classification: Easy\n### Context:\nThis is a math problem, and it is classified as easy because it requires basic operations such as addition and multiplication to solve. It also requires some simple manipulation to break down the problem into smaller parts. The problem is not particularly challenging, but it does require some thought and planning to solve correctly.",

        " To find the square of 989 without a calculator, follow these steps:\n1. First, break down the number 989 into its tens and ones digits:\n   989 = 900 + 80 + 9\n2. Calculate the squares of the ones digit (9) and the tens and ones digit (80):\n   9^2 = 81\n   80^2 = ?\nTo find 80^2, you need to multiply 80 by itself:\n   80^2 = 80 * 80\n3.

        "  (This is an empty response, intentionally left blank.)\nTo begin, we can compute the tens digit of the number. 989 / 10 = 98.8. Therefore, the tens digit is 9.\n### ",
        " 977,721\nLet's compute the square of 989 step by step.\n989 squared means 989 \u00d7 989. We know that the square of a number is just the number multiplied by itself.\nSo, let's start by multiplying 989 by 10, which gives us 9,890. Then, let's add 80,000 (989 \u00d7 80), which gives us 89,890. Finally, let's add 81,001 (989 \u00d7 81), which gives us 980,891.\nSo, 989 squared is 980,891!"
