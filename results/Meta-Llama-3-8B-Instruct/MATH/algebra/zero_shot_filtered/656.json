        " \nIf we write $$f(x)(x^2-1) = 5x^6-x^5 + 3x^4+x^3 - 25x^2 +38x -17,$$ then we can notice that the terms on the right are multiples of the left, except for the terms in $x^5, x^3, x,$ and the constant term. And if we take $x^2-1=0$ (which is $x=\\pm 1$), we get $$x^4 \\cdot f(x)(0) = 5x^4 - x^3 + 3x^2 + x - 25 + r = 0$$ and $$x^2 \\cdot f(x)(0) = - 38x + 17 + r = 0$$and  $$f(x)(0) = - 17 + r = 0$$where $r$ is some remainder. And we need to split it between the equations to obtain$$f(x) = a(x+1)(x-1)(5x^4-x^3+3x^2+x-25) +P(x)$$where $a$ is a constant and $P(x)$ is a polynomial of degree less than 4. At the same time, since the highest power in the desired expression is $5$, we must have that $4$ is the highest power of $x$ that really appears in $f(x)$. This implies that $a \\neq 0$, and that $P(x)$ contains at most $x^3$. Thus, we can rewrite $P(x) = b(x^3 + x^2 + x +1)$, where $b \\neq 0$ implies that we would then need a 4 in the polynomial, and so  this means we would have $$a =0$$ and we don\u2019t know what to do next.

        " \nThis problem says:$$\\displaystyle(x^2-1)f(x)=5x^6-x^5+3x^4+x^3-25x^2+38x-17,$$or, equivalently,$$\\displaystyle f(x)=\\frac{5x^6-x^5+3x^4+x^3-25x^2+38x-17}{x^2-1}.$$This is a rational function, and it can be expressed in the form:$$\\displaystyle f(x)=\\frac{\\text{denominator}}{\\text{denominator}}=\\frac{5x^6-x^5+3x^4+x^3-25x^2+38x-17}{x^2-1}.$$Now, the question asks us to find its degree. By looking at that numerator and realizing that it has no $x^2$ cross term, we can use the difference of squares method for this problem:$\\displaystyle 5x^6-x^5+3x^4+x^3-25x^2+38x-17=(x^3-17)(5x^3+1)+2x-25. $But the OEF of this cube is$2x-25$, which means its degree is three, i.e. the degree of the quotient of the difference of polynomial functions is three![/latex]\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 3. I hope it is correct. [/latex] [Secret] ### Solution: The degree of $f$ is 3. Explanation: The degree of a polynomial function is the highest power of $x$ that appears in the function. In this problem, we are given that $f(x)$ is a polynomial function satisfying $(x^2-1)f(x)=5x^6-x^5+3x^4+x^3 - 25x^2 +38x -17$. Since $(x^2-1)f(x)$ is a polynomial function, the degree of $(x^2-1)f(x)$ must be the highest power of $x$ that appears in $(x^2-1)f(x)$. From here, we can see that $f(x)$ must be a polynomial function, and that the degree of $f(x)$ is $6$, as polynomials in $x$ of different powers must be added together to obtain $f(x)$. Since $x^2-1",
        " To start, note that $$x^2-1=(x+1)(x-1).$$So $f(x)$ can be written as $g(x)(x+1)/z+h(x)(x-1)$, where $g(x)$ and $h(x)$ are polynomials. Now multiply both sides with $(x+1)(x-1)$ to get: \\begin{align*}\n(x+1)(x-1)f(x)&=(x+1)(x-1)\\,\\frac{g(x)(x+1)}{(x+1)(x-1)}+(x+1)(x-1)\\,\\frac{h(x)(x-1)}{(x+1)(x-1)}\\\\\n&=g(x)(x+1)+h(x)(x-1)=5x^6-x^5+3x^4+x^3-25x^2+38x-17.\n\\end{align*}Let\u2019s now look at each term and split the linear factors depending on whether they have the $x+1$ or $x-1$ factor. After we do this, we can find that $$\\boxed{\\text{degree of f = 6}}.$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 6. I hope it is correct.",
        " First, we factor out x from the R.H.S. and get L.H.S. $= 5x^5 \\left( \\frac{ x^2-1}{x} \\right) f(x) = x^5 (x-1)(x+1) f(x) = (x^2-1) f(x).$\n$=5x^5 -x^4 +3x^3 +x^2 -25x +17$, Thus, remind that we are solving $x^2 -1$, and multiplying it with $f(x)$ must be eqaul to above equation.\nNow look at above equation carefully now look where did we go wrong. You can figure the above phrase polynomial that is $polyomial$ if/and if $(x^2-1)$ we are factoring out the $x^{6}$ and we want to obtain it as having higher degree $x^{6}$-6, and we gain $-1x^{5}$. then combine $-x^{5}$. and after that we keep form into $5x^{5} \u2013 x^{5}$ which gave us again to $-x^{5}$. we are still on this note after with us from now when. Okay, Now your turn! So, $$x(x-1)f(x)=5x^5x-5x^5x+3x^4x+x^3x-25x^2x+38x-17$$ $$x^2f(x)=x^5((5x2)-(5x2)+3x4+3x2+38x-17$$ $$\\boxed{x^2 f(x) = x^5 (30x-30)}$$ [latex]\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 5.

        "  #### A degree of a function.\nThe degree of a function is the highest power of the variable in that function, which is defined as the functional power of the highest term in its polynomial.

Therefore, $a_0 = 17.$The next step is to examine the $x$-term. Since $$[x^2 - 1] \\cdot a_1 = a_1x^2 - a_1 =x(a_1x - a_1) = x a_1 ,$$we know that the $x$-term in the expression $(x^2 - 1) \\cdot f(x)$ equals $38$. Thus, $a_1 = \\frac{38}{1}$, and this implies $a_1$ is an integer. We are now looking for an expression that has $x^2$ and $x$ terms. In the given expression, after distributing, we have \\[(x^2-1) \\cdot (2x^4 - 2x^3 + x^2 + x) = 2x^6 - 2x^5 + x^4 + x^3 - 2x^3 + 2x^2 - x^2 + x.\\]We are unable to obtain the full expression just from this. Now the expression $(x^2-1) \\cdot f(x)$ has been simplified to $2x^6 - 2x^5 + x^4 + x^3 - x^4 - x^3 + 2x^2 - x^2 + x - 17$. If we expand this to the power of $6$, we get the term $2x^6$. If we add in the $-x^4$ that we get by expanding from $(x^2",
        " From the question, we know that the LHS has a factor of $x^2-1$.\n### New Answer:\nSo the LHS is \\begin{align*}(x^2-1)\\cdot f(x)&=(x^2-(1)^2)\\cdot f(x)\\\\&=(x-1)(x+1)\\cdot f(x)\\\\&=(x-1)(x+1)\\cdot (ax^4+bx^3+cx^2+dx+e)\\end{align*}where $a, b, c, d, e$ are constants. Now, the factorized form should have some terms which are the same for both LHS and RHS. Therefore, we match the terms $\\boxed{5x^6}, \\boxed{-x^5}, \\boxed{3x^4}, \\boxed{x^3}, \\boxed{-25x^2}, \\boxed{38x}, \\boxed{-17}$.$It is very clear that only $x^6$ term in the LHS should match with LHS, not the $x^5, x^4, x^3, x^2, x, 1$ terms. Hence, the polynomial should have tho hat degree $\\boxed{6}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 6.

Since $x^2-1=(x-1)(x+1)$, the product $(x^2-1)\\cdot f(x)$ cannot include any terms that are of degree $6$.  Thus the leading term of $f(x)$ must have degree at least $2$.  We know that the leading term of $f(x)$ is $ax^{n}$, where $a$ is a nonzero real number and $n$ is the degree of $f(x)$.  Then $f(x)=ax^{n}+\\cdots+b$, where the dots represent the lower-order terms.  We can divide both sides by $(x^2-1)$ to cancel the denominator, and thus we have $f(x)=\\frac{g(x)}{x^2-1}$ from which it follows that $f(x)=(\\frac{1}{x-1}+\\frac{1}{x+1})f(x)-\\frac{g(x)}{x^2-1}$.  This simplifies to $ax^n+\\cdots+b=(\\frac{1}{x-1}+\\frac{1}{x+1})(ax^n+\\cdots+b)-\\frac{g(x)}{x^2-1}$, which simplifies to $f(x)=\\cdots-\\frac{g(x)}{x^2-1}$.  The leading term on the right side of the equation is $f(x)=-\\frac{g(x)}{x^2-1}$.  Thus $-\\frac{g(1)}{0}=-5\\cdot1+1-3+1+0-37-17=-42$ implies $g(1)=-54$, so we have the following equality: $5x^6-x^5+3x^4+x^3-25x^2+38x-17 = -54$, which is not possible for polynomial of degree $6$. Therefore, we know that the leading term of $f(x)$ has degree greater than or equal to $7$. But this is a contradiction to the supposition that the degree of polynomial is $n \\le 6$. Therefore, the leading term of the polynomial $f(x)$ has degree greater",
        " We are given that $(x^2-1)f(x) = 5x^6 - x^5 + 3x^4 + x^3 - 25x^2 + 38x - 17.$\nThe left-hand side is a polynomial of degree at most 6, since $(x^2-1)=x^2-1=(x-1)(x+1)$ has degree 2. Therefore, $f(x)$ is a polynomial of at most degree 6. On the other hand, the right-hand side certainly has a term of degree 6. Therefore, the leading term of the polynomial $f(x)$ has degree 6. This means that the degree of $f(x)$ is $\\boxed{6}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 6. I hope it is correct.amburger.png [width=30px]%burger%\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 6.

Since $A$ is of degree 2, and $A\\cdot B$ is of degree 6, we get that $B$ must be of degree 6 as well. Therefore, the degree of $f$ is 6.  I hope it is correct.  The highest degree term on the right side of the equation has degree 6, and since the degree of $(x^2-1)$ is 2, the degree of the product $(x^2-1) f(x)$ is at most 6.

        " 6\nThe first term on the left side is a 2nd degree term, and it\u2019s multiplied by $f(x)$. Therefore, $f(x)$ must have $x^2 \\cdot 2 + 1 = x^2+1$ as a factor. Likewise, $f(x)$ must also have $x^5 - x + 3$ as a factor.\nThe degree of $x^5 - x + 3$ is 5, which means $\\deg(f) \\ge 5$. On the other hand, $5x^6 - x^5 + 3x^4 + x^3 - 25x^2 + 38x - 17$ is a 6th degree polynomial, so $\\deg(f) \\le 6$. The only possibility is that $\\deg(f) = \\boxed{6}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 6. I hope it is correct.  I have shown that $f$ can have at most degree 6.  What does this say about the degree of $f$? Well, we need to find an example to prove that the degree of $f$ can be 6.  As we have already found $f$ has $x^2+1$ as a factor, so let $f(x) = (x^2+1)g(x)$, where $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 4 or less.  We now have:\n$(x^2-1)(x^2+1)g(x) = 5x^6-x^5+3x^4+x^3 - 25x^2 +38x -17$\n$x^4g(x) = 5x^6-x^5+3x^4+x^3 - 25x^2 +38x -17$\nLet $\\displaystyle f(x) = (x^2+1)g(x) = x^4 g(x) + (x^2+1)(x^2-1)g(x)$\n$\\displaystyle = x^4g(x) + (x^3-x)(x^2+1)(x^2+1)g(x)$\nNow, $5x^6-x^5+3x^4+x^3 - 25x^2 +38x -17$ is divisible by both $x^4$ and $x^3-x$, because it has",
        " 5\nThe right hand side has degree 6, therefore, the expression $x^2-1$ cannot have degree 1: otherwise the left-hand side would have degree smaller than 6.\nSo, $(x^2-1)=x^2-1$ i.e., $(x-1)(x+1)=x^2-1$, and therefore\n\\begin{align*}\n(x^2-1)f(x) &= 5x^6-x^5+3x^4+x^3 - 25x^2 +38x -17 \\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad f(x) &= \\dfrac{5x^6-x^5+3x^4+x^3-25x^2+38x-17}{x^2-1} \\\\&= \\dfrac{(5x^4+38x-17)}{(x-1)(x+1)} \\\\&= \\dfrac{5x^4+38x-17}{(x-1)(x+1)}\n\\end{align*}\nThe degree of $f$ is the degree of the numerator which is 4, so the degree of $f$ is 4. The degree of $f$ is $\\boxed{5}$.\n(This solution has a little problem; we are to not be able to take out the x^2 - 1 to get the rational function: namely, we are always faced with 0 / 0: however since a numerator, a divisor, and a denominator will have a strictly positive ratio to approach something that does not depend on x.) I really don\u2019t know anything wrong about the method in Tutorial.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 5. I hope it is correct. We could see if the tutorial I made is correct. Here we can tune in the derivatives to make a rational function out of the equation!\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 5. I hope it is correct. We could see if the tutorial I made is correct. Here we can tune in the derivatives to make a rational function out of the equation! So the answer is a 4, but (in a \\''pretty \\'\\ little difference \\'\\') the degree of f is also 5.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 5. I hope it is correct.
