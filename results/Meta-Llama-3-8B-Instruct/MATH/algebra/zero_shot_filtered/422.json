    "solution": "Let the length of the playground be $l$ and the width be $w$. We have the equation $2l+2w=200 \\Rightarrow l + w = 100$. We want to maximize the area of this rectangular playground, which is given by $lw$. From our equation, we know that $l=100-w$. Substituting this in to our expression for area, we have \\[(100-w)(w)=100w-w^2\\]We will now complete the square to find the maximum value of this expression. Factoring a $-1$ out, we have \\[-(w^2-100w)\\]In order for the expression inside the parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(100/2)^2=2500$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we get \\[-(w^2-100w+2500-2500) \\Rightarrow -(w-50)^2+2500\\]Since the maximum value of $-(w-50)^2$ is 0 (perfect squares are always nonnegative), the maximum value of the entire expression is 2500, which is achieved when $w=50$ and $l=100-w=50$ (the playground is a square). Thus, the maximum area of the playground is $\\boxed{2500}$ square feet.",

Define the problem:** \nWe want to find the maximum area of this playground. We will express the problem in mathematical term by using the variables.\nLet the width of the playground be **w** and the length be **l**.\nThe perimeter of the playground is given to us, which is 200 feet, so we can express it in terms of **w** and **l**.\n**Perimeter =** **2l** + **2w** = **200** (since the playground is enclosed, the perimeter is the total fencing length)\n**Step 2. Solve for **w** or **l**:** \nWe can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by **2**.\n(**l** + **w**) = **100** (since **2** divides both sides)\n**Step 3.

        " \nLet x be the length of the playground, then $2x$ be the width.\nSo, the rectangle\u2019s perimeter is $2x + 2x = 4x$.  Now, since the length of fencing is 200 feet, we have $4x = 200$ feet, which implies $x = 50$ feet.  The area of the playground is $\\boxed{1000 \\mbox{ ft}^2}$.\n### Solution: \nThe strategy is to first write a system of equations in terms of the two variables involved. Since the perimeter is 200 feet, the total length of fencing is $P=2l+2w$, where $l$ and $w$ are the length and width of the rectangular playground, respectively. We know this perimeter must also equal the 200 feet of fencing:\n\\begin{align*}\nP&=2l+2w\\\\\n200&=2l+2w\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad l+w&=100\n\\end{align*}\nSo, we have created a system of equations:\n\\begin{align*}\nl+w&=100\\\\\nl\\times w&=a\n\\end{align*}\nThe object is to maximize $a$. Note that $a=lw$ is less than $(l+w)^2/4$.

        " \nIn this instruction, we are told that Richard is building a rectangular playground from 200 feet of fencing. To enclose the playground entirely, he uses some amount of fencing to make the rectangle.\nA rectangle has 4 sides. Let the width of the rectangle be **w** and let the length be **l**. So, the rectangle has 2 sides of length **w**, and 2 sides of length **l**.\nThe total length of the fencing is 200 feet. In this case, the total length of the fencing is\n2*\\*w + 2*\\*l\nHere, we use the fact that there are 2 sides of length **w**, and 2 sides of length **l**.\nNow we need to set an inequality on this.\nThe total length of fencing, in this case, 2* *w + 2* *l = 200. Here, we chose 2*w as w\u02e3\u02e3 Two frequencies on the two sides of length w.\nSo, 2*w + 2*l = 200.\nNow we need to solve for *l*.\n2*w = 200 - 2*l\nw = 100 - l\nSo, now we need to find the maximum area of the rectangle. The area is the length * width, and we have found the length in terms of * w*.\nThe area is:\nl*w = l*(100 - l)\nHere, we simply substitute l^x\u02e3 w = l  n.\nSo, the area is equal to -l\u02e32+100l. We can also write this as:\nl^2-100l+\nTo find the maximum value, we can use AM-GM inequality.\n*AM-GM inequality says that if there are n real numbers, then their average \u2265 their geometric mean.*\nHere, we have 2 terms: l/2 and 100.\nAverage \u2265 geometric mean.\n(100 + l)/2 \u2265 \u221a(100*l)\nHere, we use the *inequality*.\n100 \u2265 2 * \u221a(100*l) or 400 \u2265 400*l\nSo, we have:\nThe area has a maximum value 100\u02e3 When l = 50.\nSo, the maximum area of the rectangle is 100\u02e350.\nTherefore, the maximum area of the playground is 5000 sqft.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 5000.

        " \nUsing the fact that the perimeter is given by $P = 2(l + w)$, where $l$ and $w$ are the length and width of the playground, respectively, and where $P = 200$, we have that\n$$200 = 2(l + w)\\Rightarrow l + w = 100.$$Since we are seeking the maximum area, which is given by $A = lw$, we can write $lw = (100 - w)w$, where $l = 100 - w$. Taking the derivative of the new expression for $A$ with respect to $w$ and setting the result equal to zero, we have\n$$(100 - w)\\cdot 1 - w\\cdot 1 = 0\\Rightarrow 100 - w - w = 0\\Rightarrow 2w=100\\Rightarrow w = 50.$$Therefore, we have $l = 50$.

        " \nLet\u2019s now try to find the maximum area of the playground given the restriction that the perimeter of the playground must be equal to 200 feet.\nLet the width of the playground be W feet and the length be L feet.\nSince the perimeter is 200 feet and one side of the perimeter has length W and the other sides have lengths L, we can set up an equation based on the perimeter formula:\n2W + 2L = 200\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\nW + L = 100\nNow, we can set up an equation based on the area formula:\nArea = W * L\nWe will try to maximize this area. To do so, we can take the derivative of the area with respect to W and set it equal to zero:\nd(Area)/dW = d(W * L)/dW = L + W * dL/dW = 0\nWe can solve this equation for L:\nL = -W * dL/dW\nSince dimensions cannot be negative, we can ignore the negative sign:\nL = W * dL/dW\nNow, using dL/dW = 1 (since L is a function of W), we can simplify the equation:\nL = W\nNow we can find the area in terms of W:\nArea = W * L = W^2\nNow we can find the dimensions of the rectangle at which the area is maximum. We can set up an equation using the perimeter equation we simplified earlier:\nW + L = 100\nSubstituting L = W, we get:\nW + W = 100\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n2W = 100\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\nW = 50\nNow we know that the width of the playground is 50 feet. Using the area equation, we get:\nArea = W^2 = 50^2 = 2500 square feet\nSo, the maximum area of the rectangular playground that can be enclosed using 200 feet of fencing is 2500 square feet.\n### Example ",
        " Richard is building a rectangular playground from 200 feet of fencing. The fencing must entirely enclose the playground. What is the maximum area of this playground?\nSolution: Here we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle. \nLet the length of the playground be l and the width be w. The total perimeter is the sum of the lengths of all four sides:\nl + l + w + w = 200\nCombine like terms:\n2l + 2w = 200\nSubtract 2l and 2w:\nl + w = 100\nNow, we want to maximize the area of the playground. The area of the playground is given by the formula:\nA=lw\nWe can also express l in terms of w:\nl=100-w\nNow, substitute l into the equation for the area:\nA=(100-w)w\nTake the derivative of A with respect to w and set it equal to 0 to find the maximum:\ndw/dw=-w+100=0\n-w+100=0\n-w=-100\nw=100\nSo, w=100. Now, solve for l:\nl=100-w=100-100=0\nBut, we cannot have a length and width of 0. So, we need to find another maximum. Another way to find the maximum is to set the first derivative equal to some non-zero constant. Let c be some non-zero constant:\ndw/dw=-w+100=c\n-w=-100+c\nw=100-c\nNow, substitute w back into the area equation to get the area in terms of c:\nA=c(100-c)\nTake the derivative of A with respect to c and set it equal to 0 to find the maximum:\ndA/dc=c(100-c)-c^2=0\n-c(100-c)+c^2=0\n-c^2+100c-c^2=0\n100c=0\nc=0\nBut, we know c cannot be 0, since we assumed it was non-zero. So, we must have set the derivative equal to 0 incorrectly. The mistake is that we are trying to find another maximum when we only have one variable.\nThe maximum occurs when w=100 and l=0. The area of the playground is:\nA=lw=0*100=0",
        " \nLet\u2019s denote the length and width of the rectangular playground by L and W, respectively. Since the fencing must entirely enclose the playground, we have $2L + 2W = 200$, so $L = 100 - W/2$.\nWe want to maximize the area of the playground, which is $A = LW$.\nSubstitute $L$ into the area in terms of W:\n\\begin{align*}\nA &= (100 - W/2)W\\\\\n&=100W - W^2/2 = (100 - W)(W/2)\n\\end{align*}\nNotice that when $W$ increases, $(100 - W)$ decreases, and vice versa. Since we want to maximize $A$, the product must be maximized. This is achieved when one of the factors is zero, and the other factor is at its maximum. Since $(W/2)$ cannot be negative, the zero is when $100 - W = 0$, so $W = 100$.\nThen, the maximum area is $A = 100^2/2 = \\boxed{5000}$ square feet.\n### Solution explanation:\nInitial hint: To solve this problem, we use the concept of constraint.\nConvert the constraint of rectangular playground to equation: $2L + 2W = 200$\nUse substitution to define the relationship of L and W: $L = 100 - W/2$\nThen we find the maximum area as a function of W, and note that the product stops increasing when one of the factors is zero. Then one of them must be at maximum, and another must be zero. Use W = 100 to plug in to L to find the maximum area. Finally, simplify and get the answer.\nFinal answer: The final answer is 5000. I hope it is correct.UEL! because when the other factor (in this case, 100 - W) is at its maximum, the other factor is zero.

The circumference of the playground is the perimeter, which must be 200 feet. So, we have:\n$$2x + 2y = 200$$\n3. The area of the playground is:\n$$A = xy$$\n4. We need to simplify the perimeter equation and express y in terms of x.\n$$2x + 2y = 200$$\n$$x + y = 100$$\n5. Substitute y with 100 - x in the area equation:\n$$A = x(100 -x)$$\n6.

        " First, we must look for the constraint for our problem. The constraint is the portion of the fencing (200 feet) used to make the rectangular playground. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: P = 2L + 2W, where L is the length and W is the width. Since Richard has 200 feet of fencing, the perimeter of the rectangle will have to be equal to 200 feet. Then we can set up the equation: P = 2L + 2W = 200; 2L + 2W = 200. Now we will solve for L and W. We can express L alone by subtracting 2W from both sides of the equation. L = (200/2) \u2013 W; L = 100 \u2013 W. We have reduced the equation to find the length L only. Now we can substitute this value into the original area equation. The formula for the area of a rectangle is: A = L * W, where L is the length and W is the width. The substituted value for L would be 100 \u2013 W. Therefore, we have: A = (100 \u2013 W) * W. We now solve for the maximum area. To do this, we must take the derivative of the function with respect to W, which will give us the slope of the function at each point. Then, we set that equal to 0 and solve for W. The derivative of A with respect to W is: dA/dW = -W^2 + 100. Now we set the derivative equal to 0: -W^2 + 100 = 0. Solving for W, we obtain: W^2 = 100; W = \u00b1\u221a100; W = \u00b110. We are not concerned about negative solutions, since widths cannot be negative. Valid solution: W = 10. Now we plug this value of W back into our area equation to find the maximum area: A = (100 \u2013 W) * W; A = (100 \u2013 10) * 10; A = 900. The maximum area of the playground is 900 square feet.\n### ",

The rectangle has four sides, which we will call sides A, B, C, and D:\nA = L, B = W, C = L, D = W\nThe playground is enclosed by 200 feet of fencing, so the perimeter of the rectangle (the sum of all the sides) must equal 200 feet. We can set up an equation using the perimeter:\nA + B + C + D = 200\nThis simplifies to:\n2L + 2W = 200\nSimplify the left side:\nL + W = 100\nThis equation tells us that the sum of the length and width is 100 feet.\nNow, to find the maximum area of the playground, we need to maximize the product of L and W.

Hence, $2(l)+2(w)$ gives the total length of fencing used.\nNow, solve for $\\ell$ in terms of $w$ by rearranging the equation as follows:\n$\\ell=50-w$\nFind the area of the playground as a function of $w$:\nArea $=A=l*w$\nSubstitute the value of $\\ell=50-w$:\n$A=(50-w)*w$\nAnd simplify:\n$A=50w-w^2$\nLet\u2019s find the maximum area of the playground by taking the derivative of $A$ with respect to $w$ and equating it to zero:\n$\\frac{d}{dw}A=50-2w$\nSet the derivative equal to zero:\n$50-2w=0$\nSolve for $w$:\n$50=2w$\n$\\frac{50}{2}=w$\n$w=25$\nPlug this value back into $A=50w-w^2$ to get the maximum area:\n$A=(50-25)^2$\n$A=25^2$\n$A=\\boxed{625}$\n### Conclusion:\nThe maximum area of the playground is 625 square feet. This is because when we take the derivative of the function A (with respect to w), we get 0, which means we have reached the maximum. In this case, the length of the playground is 50 - 25 = 25 feet, and the width is 25 feet, giving an area of 625 square feet. Note that the length and width can be interchanged, but the maximum area remains the same.",
        " \nThe formula for the area of a rectangle is:\nArea = length * width\nWe can use this formula to find the area given the length and width of the rectangle.\nHowever, we are dealing with a rectangle that is enclosed by fencing. The fencing is 200 feet long. Since it\u2019s a perimeter (the distance around a shape), it is the sum of the lengths of all four sides of the rectangle.\nThe perimeter formula is:\nPerimeter = 2 * (length + width)\nSince we are given the perimeter, we can use the formula to solve for length + width:\n200 = 2 * (length + width)\nSimplify the equation:\n100 = length + width\nNow we can use this value for length + width to find the maximum area of the playground.\nLet\u2019s create a variable, x, to represent length, and y, to represent width. We know length + width = 100, and we want to maximize the area.\nArea = length * width = x * (100 - x)\nTake the derivative of the area with respect to x:\nd/dx (x * (100 - x)) = 0\nThis will give us the critical point for x. To solve for x, simplify the derivative and set it equal to 0:\n(100 - x) - x = 0\nSimplify and solve for x:\n100 - 2x = 0\nx = 50\nNow that we have the value for x, we can find the maximum area:\nArea = x * (100 - x)\n Substitute x = 50:\nArea = 50 * (100 - 50)\nSimplify:\nArea = 50 * 50\nArea = 2500\nTherefore, the maximum area of the playground is 2500 square feet.",
        " \nLet\u2019s use letters to represent unknown variables. Let the length of the rectangular playground be L feet and the width be W feet.\nWe know the perimeter of the playground is 200 feet, which means that L + W + L + W = 200.\nWe can simplify the equation by combining like terms, which gives us 2L + 2W = 200.\nNext, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation to get 2L + 2W - 2 = 200 - 2.\nThis simplifies to 2L + 2W - 2 = 198.\nNext, we divide both sides of the equation by 2. This gives us L + W - 1 = 99.\nNow let\u2019s think about what this equation means. The equation L + W - 1 = 99 means that the length plus the width of the rectangular playground is 99.\nThis means that the maximum area will occur when L + W is as large as possible.\nTo find the maximum value for L + W, we can draw a number line with L on the left side and W on the right side. We know that the x-coordinate of the maximum value is -1 because L + W - 1 = 99.\nIn this number line, L is less than W, so the maximum area will occur when the width of the playground is the maximum.\nThis means that W is equal to 99, and L is equal to 0.\nNow we can find the area of the rectangular playground using the formula A = lw, where A is the area, and L and W are the length and width, respectively.\nThe area is equal to 0 * 99, which is equal to 0.\nSo, the maximum area of this playground is 0 feet squared.\nDoes this solution correspond to the maximum area for a given perimeter? Does the original problem statement consider any additional information? Answer these returning questions.\nWhat flaws would you identify in this remarkable solution to the problem\nsomething you would say\n\u201cHmm, I don\u2019t think this can be right. What are we doing with LW?\u201d our question.\nFinal Solution: To create the playground Richard must start first with two sides that can be a frame. Then Each side can be further divided to 2 sides forming a rectangle. So width will be less than length.\n### Solution :\nP reaction. Because a width less than length should make sense, it will be true maximum number as we will start our playground with",
        "  As a rectangular playground, the perimeter means the fences. So, the two lengths (let them be let x and y) must add up with the fence perimeter, and 2 times the fence length. So,\nx + y = P = 200 feet and perimeter formula P = 2(l + w)\nWhere P is perimeter, l is length, and w is width.\nIt simplifies: x + y = 200. Now we try to find the x or y.\nWe take square the both sides,\nxy = 200 x y\nTo get rid of x and y:\nxy = 200 x y\ny = 200/x and xy = 200 x y\nxy = 200 and xy = t\n200/(z+200) = 1\nz+200 = 200 and z = 200\nIt means z is a constant (z is 0)\nxy = t\nxy = z\nFor area t = x*y we get:\nz * t = t\nt = 0\nSince t = 0 we have t =\nSo we see that t = 0 is outside reasonable values, as well as t > 4 square feet.\nWhat do you need help with?\nDo you want me to help you solve this in the future?\nOr do you have more questions about this?\nFinal Answer: The final answer is t = 400 square feet. I hope it is correct. Administrators, please go ahead and double check the answer to see if it is indeed correct or not.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\[200\\sqrt{5}\\] square feet.

        " The perimeter of the playground is 2x + 2y, so 200 = 2x + 2y. The area is x \\* y. We want to maximize the area.\nIf we look at the graph of the perimeter equation, we see that it forms a parabola. We can see that the area reaches the maximum when the derivative is 0. We know that\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} (x y) = y + x \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x}. So the maximum will occur when y + x \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x} = 0.\nThe perimeter equation is y = 100 - x. So \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x} = -1.\nThe maximum area must satisfy y + x (-1) = 0. So y = x.\nSubstituting y = 100 - x into y = x, we get 100 - x = x. Solving for x, we get x = 50.\nThe maximum area is 50 * 50 = 2500 square feet.\n### Connection to real life: This is a classic problem in optimization and geometry. It is used to demonstrate how to find the maximum area of a rectangular enclosure given its perimeter. It can be applied to real-life scenarios such as designing a farm, a wildlife sanctuary, or a private garden."
