        " $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{\\ln 2}}$\nSolution.\nThis is quite straightforward. In this problem, $\\log_21$ denotes the base-2 logarithm of 1. In other words, we need to determine the value of $b$ in the equation $2^b=1.$ The only power of any $x$ that will ever equal 1 is $x^0$, since that is when the exponential term drops out. Hence, $2^b=1$ only when $b=0.$ Thus, $\\log_21=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{\\ln2}.}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\frac{1}{\\ln2}. I hope it is correct.  If you like the problem, check it out.

        " Let\u2019s start by defining what is $$\\log_21$$.\n$$\\log_21$$ is the solution to $$\\log_21^x=1.$$This is the same as $$x = \\log_21^x = 1,$$where we set $$x=\\log_21,$$making it\u2019s own value. Since $$1=1,$$this means $$\\boxed{\\log_21=1}.$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 1. I hope it is correct. If the final answer is wrong, please correct it.
