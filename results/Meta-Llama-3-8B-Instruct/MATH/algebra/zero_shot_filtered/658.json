        " $\\boxed{2}$\nFor two of the variables, say $a, b$, we have that $(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$.  Since we know that the sum of the squares is $13$ and the sum of the products is $6$, we would need $(a+b)^2 = 7$, and we would still need one more term to add to get $13$ on the right-hand side, so we try to let $c = 3 - (a+b)$.  In this case we have\n$$a^2 + b^2 + 3 - (a + b) = 13 \\Rightarrow (a + b)^2 + 3 - (a + b) = 13.$$\nNow by substituting $7$ again for $(a+b)^2$, we obtain\n$7 + 3 - (a+b) = 13 \\Rightarrow - (a + b) = 3 \\Rightarrow a + b = \\boxed{-3}$.\nSo the sum of $a, b,$ and $c$ is the sum of $a + b$ and $c$.  If $c = 3 - (a + b)$, then $a + b + c$ is $3 - (a + b) + a + b = \\boxed{3}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 3.

        " 1\nStep 1: Use the sum of squares: We know that $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 13$. Note that this sum is always nonnegative.\nStep 2: The answer choices will guide us to make an educated guess for the sum. As you will find out, the sum $a + b + c$ is actually even, and since the question asks for the sum, this guide us to consider the summod2.\nLet\u2019s break $a+b+c =e+f$ into two parts, where e is the even part, and f is the odd part. Then the sum of square of $a+b+c$ = $e^2 + 2ef + f^2$ can be written as $e^2 + 2ef + f^2 = (e+f)^2 - 2ef$. The sum of square of $a,b,c$ can be written as $(a+b+c)^2 - 2ab -2bc - 2ca = (e+f)^2 - 2ef -2ab -2bc - 2ca$. So we have $(a+b+c)^2 - 2ab -2bc - 2ca = 13$.\nNow let\u2019s consider the choice. The choice that sum is $a+b+c = 3$ or $ab+bc+ca = -6$ then it will imply that the $2ab+2bc+2ca = 0$ which is same as $a^2+b^2+c^2+2ab+2bc+2ca$ is $0$ which is not true.\nSo, the only choice is that $a+b+c$ is $2e$, where $e$ is even, then we have $e^2+f^2 = 13$ implies $e^2+f^2 - 2ef = f^2 - 2ef + e^2 = 13$ this implies $2ef = f^2 + e^2 - 13 = 0$ which also implies $f = 0$ then $a+b+c = e = e$ which is $4$.\nSo the sum of $a,b,c$ = 4. Correct answer is $\\boxed{D}$.",
        "  $\\boxed{0}.$\nNotice that $(a+b+c)^2=a^2+b^2+c^2+2(ab+bc+ca),$so the sum of the squares of $a,b,$ and $c$ is $13$ means that $$(a+b+c)^2=13+2\\cdot6=19\\Rightarrow a+b+c=\\boxed{0}.$$Final Answer: The final answer is 0. I hope it is correct. Please let me know if I made any mistake.  Actually, I made mistake. I did not think it through. Now, let\u2019s prove that $(a+b+c)^2=19$ if $a^2+b^2+c^2=13$ and $ab+bc+ca=6$. Define $P=(a+b+c)^2$. We can write $P$ as $$P=a^2+b^2+c^2+2(ab+bc+ca)=13+2\\cdot6=19.$$Hence, the sum of the squares of $a,b,$ and $c$ is 19, so $\\boxed{1}$ is the answer.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 1. I hope it is correct. Please let me know if I made any mistake.  I made another mistake. The problem is asking us to find the sum of $a,b,$ and $c$, not that of their squares. Let\u2019s define $P=a^2+b^2+c^2$ to be the sum of the squares of $a,b,$ and $c$. The problem says that $P=13$ and $ab+bc+ca=6$.\nDefine $Q=a+b+c$. Then note that $$Q^2=(a+b+c)^2=a^2+b^2+c^2+2(ab+bc+ca)=P+2Q\\cdot1=P+2Q,$$ which is just $19$ since $P=13$. Solving for $Q$, we have $$Q=\\pm\\sqrt{19}.$$ But each $a,b,$ and $c$ is nonnegative, so $Q$ must be $0$ since the sum of the positive numbers is a sum of squares of nonnegative numbers, which is nonnegative.

It is great that the problem solver started with the sum of squares formula, which is a good choice. The problem solver also cleverly manipulated the formula to set up an equation where the left-hand side is equal to 25. Then, taking the square root of both sides, the problem solver arrived at the correct answer, 5. However, the problem solver could have been more explicit in their work, especially in the step where they combined all terms. Providing more detail, such as writing out the full equation $a^2+b^2+c^2+2(ab+bc+ca)=25$ and then simplifying it, would make the solution more clear and confident.\nhttps://mathcounts.gr/2012/topol/2012-topl/download.php?f=pdf/2012-topl/pdf/solution_1.pdf\nMoreover, the problem solver did not show whether they tested the provided answer choices for validity, which provides some uncertainty in the correctness of the solution. A good approach would be to note that since the sum of the squares of nonnegative real numbers is 13 and the sum of those numbers is 5, the numbers must be consecutive, and hence, the largest number is 3. Hence, we have that $a+b+c=5$ and that $ab+bc+ca=6$, so $a="
