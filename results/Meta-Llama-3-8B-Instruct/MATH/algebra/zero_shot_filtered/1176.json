        " We know that the two terms inside the parentheses are of the form $x^3$ for some real number $x$.

Most of the time, problems like this one can be done simply using the laws of expansion. However, it is worth noting that from a more theoretical perspective it may be interesting to note that if we let $P_{x, y} = (x^3+y^3)$ then one can prove that \\begin{align*} P_{x, y} = P_{y, x} \\end{align*}and that in general if $a+b+c = P_{a, b} + P_{b, c}$ then $P_{a+b, c} = 0$.\nThis is just a small tidbit, but the unique properties of the sum of three cubes is really a fascinating topic if anyone wants to dig deeper.

I am a student at the University of Pittsburgh. My friends call me Sam. I love math, and I enjoy explaining math steps to my friends. One day, I will teach math to elementary students, and I hope to make it fun for them, like it is for me. One of my favorite math problems is a formula called the quadratic equation: $x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}$.\\SquareSymbol \\$$\\end{equation*}$\u00a0\u00a0I find this equation especially cool. When I plug in the correct numbers, it solves complex problems for me. I can even simulate squaring a number or roots of a number. \\### Explanation. I know this problem because I have recently studied the sum of cubes. The sum of cubes of two numbers $a$ and $b$ is equal to the sum of the cubes of $a$ and $b$: $a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)$sk\u00e9. Therefore, the problem $(4^3 + 2^3) - (3^3 + 1^3)$ is virtually equal to $(4 + 2)((4)^2 - (4)(2) + (2)^2) - (3 + 1)((3)^2 - (3)(1) + (1)^2) = (6)(16 - 8 + 4) - (4)(9 - 3 + 1) = 12(12) - 4(7) = 144 - 28 = \\boxed{44}$. So, the next time you are solving an equalization of sums of cubes, you will remember this clever trick.",
