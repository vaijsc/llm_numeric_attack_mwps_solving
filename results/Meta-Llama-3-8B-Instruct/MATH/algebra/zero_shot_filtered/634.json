        "To determine the degree of the polynomial expression \\(2f(x) + 4g(x)\\), we first need to understand the degrees of the individual polynomials involved.\n1. **Identify the degree of each polynomial**:\n   - The polynomial \\(f(x)\\) is of degree 3. This means the highest power of \\(x\\) in \\(f(x)\\) is \\(x^3\\).\n   - The polynomial \\(g(x)\\) is of degree 5. Therefore, the highest power of \\(x\\) in \\(g(x)\\) is \\(x^5\\).\n2. **Scale the polynomials**:\n   - The expression \\(2f(x)\\) is effectively \\(2\\) times the polynomial \\(f(x)\\). Since scaling a polynomial by a non-zero constant does not change its degree, the degree of \\(2f(x)\\) remains 3.\n   - Similarly, \\(4g(x)\\) is \\(4\\) times the polynomial \\(g(x)\\). The degree of \\(4g(x)\\) also remains 5 after scaling.\n3. **Combine the scaled polynomials**:\n   - Now we can combine both terms: \\(2f(x) + 4g(x)\\). This expression will have terms contributed by both polynomials. \n   - The dominating term that will define the degree of the sum is the term with the highest degree from either \\(2f(x)\\) or \\(4g(x)\\).\n4. **Determine the maximum degree**:\n   - The degree of \\(2f(x)\\) is 3.\n   - The degree of \\(4g(x)\\) is 5.\n   - Therefore, when combining these two, the overall degree of \\(2f(x) + 4g(x)\\) is the maximum of the two degrees:\n     \\[\n     \\max(3, 5) = 5\n     \\]\nThus, the degree of the polynomial \\(2f(x) + 4g(x)\\) is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).",

        " Let's analyze each part separately.\nIf $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3, then we know that $f(x) = a_3x^3 + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0$, where $a_3$, $a_2$, $a_1$, and $a_0$ are constants. The degree of $f(x)$ is 3 because of the leading term $$a_3x^3$$.\nIf $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 5, then we know that $g(x) = b_5x^5 + b_4x^4 + b_3x^3 + b_2x^2 + b_1x + b_0$, where $b_5$, $b_4$, $b_3$, $b_2$, $b_1$, and $b_0$ are constants.

Let's do that.\nWhen we add $2f(x)$ and $4g(x)$, the leading term will be the sum of the leading terms from each of the polynomials.\nThe leading term of $2f(x)$ is $$2a_3x^3$$ because $f(x)$ is of degree 3.\nThe leading term of $4g(x)$ is $$4b_5x^5$$ because $g(x)$ is of degree 5.\nWhen we add these together, we get $$2a_3x^3 + 4b_5x^5$$, which is the leading term of $2f(x) + 4g(x)$.

Therefore, the degree of $2f(x)+4g(x)$ is $\\boxed{5}$, because the highest power is the degree, which is 5 in this case.",

        " Degree $= 5$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 5. I hope it is correct. Let me know if I made any mistake. Thanks! \nDegree of 2f(x) + 4g(x) is max(3,5) . The degree of f(x) is 3, of g(x) is 5. The leading term of the polynomial will be the term with the highest degree. Thus, the leading term is from g(x). It will be 4*g(x). Why not 2*f(x)? Because, the leading term of 2f(x) is 2*f(x) which is still less than 4*g(x). The degree of the leading term is the degree of the polynomial. Therefore, the degree of 2f(x) + 4g(x) is 5.

        " Because any non-zero constant is always non-zero, we can write $f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$, where $a\\neq 0$.
