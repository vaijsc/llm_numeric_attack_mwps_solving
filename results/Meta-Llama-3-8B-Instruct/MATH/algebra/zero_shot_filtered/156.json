The equation $9x^2+nx+36=0$ has exactly one solution in $x$ means that the discriminant is equal to zero $n^2-4\\cdot9\\cdot36=0\\Rightarrow n^2-1296=0\\Rightarrow (n+54)(n-54)=0\\Rightarrow n=54,-54$Positive value of $n$ is $\\boxed{54}$  We know that the quadratic equation $Ax^2+Bx+C=0$ has exactly one solution if and only if the discriminant $B^2-4AC$ is equal to zero. Since the quadratic equation $9x^2+nx+36=0$ has exactly one solution, the discriminant $B^2-4AC$ must equal to $0$.  Let's simplify the discriminant. $$(n)^2-4(9)(36)=n^2-1296=0$$ $$n^2=1296$$  Now, we need to consider all real values of $n$. These are $n=-54$ and $n=54$. Since the problem asked for a positive value of $n$, it must equal"
