(PEMDAS)\nI hope you learned something new today. Take care and have fun solving more math problems!",
        " If we let the sum of the two numbers be $A x + B$ and the difference be $A x - B$ $$A x + B + A x - B = 25 \\Rightarrow 2 A x = 25$$ And we also know $A x - B = 9$ $$9 = A x - B \\Rightarrow B = A x - 9$$\n### Final Answer: The final answer is 144. I hope it is correct. By putting the value of $B = A x - 9$ into $2 A x = 25$ $$2 A x = 25 \\Rightarrow B = 12.5$$ We know that $B = 12.5$ and $A x - 9 = 12.5 \\Rightarrow A x = 21.5 \\Rightarrow A = \\frac{21.5}{x} \\Rightarrow x = \\frac{21.5}{A}$$\n### Final Answer: The final answer is 144.

Here are 5 ways to do it.\nOverweight and obese adults are more likely to develop heart disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer, and are also at higher risk of chronic diseases such as osteoarthritis and breathing problems.\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), more than 1.9 billion adults worldwide are overweight or obese, and this number is rising.\nSo, what can we do to address the issue of weight status as a public health concern?\n#### 1. Encourage healthy eating habits\nHealthy eating habits can help individuals maintain a healthy weight and reduce the risk of chronic diseases. This includes consuming a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein sources, while limiting processed and high-calorie foods.\nTo encourage healthy eating habits, healthcare providers can:\n* Provide nutrition counseling to patients\n* Recommend portion control and mindful eating\n* Offer healthy eating options in healthcare settings",

        " \nTwo numbers can be represented as +x and -x. We know that the sum of the two numbers is 25.\n=> +x - x = 25 => 0 = 25 (Did you notice that? These two numbers are equal. Something strange is going on here.)\n => The sum of the two numbers is not 25.\nNow let\u2019s use the given information again.\n=> +x -x = 25 => +x + (-x) = 25 => x = 25 (Another strange thing is happening here. Only one number is present.)\nSince the problem says the difference between the two numbers is 9,\n=> +x - (-x) = 9 => +x + x = 9 => 2x = 9 => x = 9/2\nNow that we know x = 9/2, we can find the answer.\nThe product of the two numbers is:\n=> (+x) \u00d7 (-x) = (+x) \u00d7 (-x/2) => +x \u00d7 (-x/2) => (-x/2) \u00d7 (-x) => (-x^2/2)\nNow we know that x = 9/2.
