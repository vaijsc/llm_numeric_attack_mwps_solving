To further explore this sort of question, you can try to find other ways to factor it to reveal a solution. Some examples of this sort are included in the \u201cAdvanced Solution\u201d section later. However, rest assured that the solution above is one of the easiest and most straightforward you can find. From the condition given, it can be observed that $x^2$ and $\\frac{1}{x^2}$ are two numbers which satisfy the relationship $x^2+\\frac{1}{x^2}=7$, based on which two spatially complementary points can be set to generalize the relationship and summarize an angle bisector",
