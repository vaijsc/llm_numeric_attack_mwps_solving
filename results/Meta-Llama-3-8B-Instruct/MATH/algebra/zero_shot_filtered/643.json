If Adina is normally size 6, what size rock-climbing shoes should she rent assuming shoe size is directly proportional to rock-climbing shoe size?",
        " If Lynn, who is size 9, needs a 42, then the proportion is $\\frac{9}{42} = \\frac{1}{\\left(\\right. 42/9 \\left.\\right)}$ This means that for every foot Adina is normally, she needs a $42/9 = 4.666...$ foot rock-climbing shoe. But if she is normally 6 feet, then she will need 6 \u00d7 4.666... = 25.996... feet. Now, because shoe size is not normally measured in this way, we need to round down to the nearest whole number, so she will need to get a size 25 shoe.\nThis question can be asked in many different ways. We can also formulate the equation as y = mx+b. This equation represents the relationship between the normal shoe size and the rock-climbing shoe size. Thus, the equation for this problem can be written as $y = \\left(\\right. 4.666... \\left.\\right) x$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 25.

The equation is $y = \\left(\\right. 4.666... \\left.\\right) x$\nWhen x is 0, the y-value is y = 0 * 4.666... = 0\nThe y-intercept is 0.

So, we have the equation <br>\n(x - 6) \u00d7 (<br>\n0.125 = 3 <br>\n### Transcribing\nLet $x$ be the additional Rock Climbing size required for Adina.\nWe have $x-6=3$, which is the same as $x=3+6=\\boxed{9}.$",
        " Okay!\nFirst, let\u2019s set up an equation to represent the relationship between normal shoe size and rock-climbing shoe size. Let x be Adina's normal shoe size (which is 6). So the equation becomes:\n42 = 9k\nwhere k is a constant of proportionality.\nNow, we solve for k. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by 9:\nk = 42/9\nk = 4.666...\nNow that we have the value of k, we can set up an equation for Adina. Let y be Adina's rock-climbing shoe size. The equation becomes:\ny = 6k\ny = 6*4.666...\ny = 28.00...\nSo, Adina should rent rock-climbing shoes that are size 28.\n### Conclusion: Adina should rent rock-climbing shoes that are size 28.

Would you like to try another problem? I have one ready!",
        " \nTo find Adina\u2019s rock-climbing shoe size, we need to use the proportionality relationship:\nRock-climbing shoe size directly proportional to normal shoe size\nThis means that if we divide normal shoe size by the corresponding rock-climbing shoe size, the result should be the same for both Lynn and Adina.\nFor Lynn: $9 / 42 = \\frac{1}{4.67}$\nLet\u2019s say Adina\u2019s normal shoe size is x.

        " To find Adina's shoe size after conversion, first, we need to know the ratio of rock-climbing shoe sizes (even though it doesn't look like a ratio, dividing by the number, gives us some understanding of the ratio). 42 divided by 9 gives us 4.66666666.... So, for every 1 unit increase in normal shoe size, we have approximately 4.67 increased units for rock-climbing shoe size.   To get from 6 to 9, we subtract 3, 6-3=3. Then we find out how many rock-climbing shoe sizes we need to add to normal 3. So we multiply 3 with 4.67 which gives 14.01... Now, we add 42 (50% of 42) with 14.01 which gives 56.01 or, in rough estimate, we round it up to 56. So for normal shoe size of 6, Adina should rent rock-climbing shoes of 56. \nFinal Answer: The final answer is Adina should rent 56. I hope it is correct.  #### [Here's a more rigorous way to solve it, based on Ratios]: The relationship between normal shoe size and rock-climbing shoe size is given by a constant k, where k = (rock-climbing shoe size) / (normal shoe size). In the case of Lynn, we are given a value for this constant, k = 42 / 9 = 4.6666... Now, to find the rock-climbing shoe size for Adina, who normally wears a size 6, we multiply the normal shoe size by 4.6666...: $$k \\times 6 = 4.6666... \\times 6 = 28.000...$$ So, Adina's rock-climbing shoe size will be approximately 28. Note that rounding up in this case, Adina should rent rock-climbing shoes of size 29. For a normal shoe size, conversion is not simple, so it's not enough to simply 'round up' without considering the precise relationship. Nevertheless, in this particular problem, rounding up is still allowed as long as it is done carefully. Final Answer: The final answer is Adina should rent 29. I hope it is correct. (That I'm right!)

I hope it is correct. There are two people, Adina and Lynn. Adina's normal shoe size is 6, while Lynn's normal shoe size is 9.

        " Lynn, normally size 9, is 42 in rock-climbing shoes. So the change from size 9 to 42 is +32.

The change from size 6 to Adina\u2019s rock-climbing shoe size is +36.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 36. I hope it is correct.````\n### Explanation:\nThe problem can be understood as follows. Since shoe size is directly proportional to rock-climbing shoe size, we can find Adina's rock-climbing shoe size by adding a change in size to her normal size. Let the change in size be 'x'. Lynn, normally size 9, is 42 in rock-climbing shoes, so 9 + x = 42 and x = 33. Similarly, Adina, who is normally size 6, is size 6 + x. This change in size from 6 to Adina's rock-climbing shoe size is +36, which means x = 36.\nBoth Lynn and Adina have the same type of foot, so their increase in rock-climbing shoe size equals the change in their normal shoe size. Moreover, if shoe size is directly proportional to rock-climbing shoe size, the change in shoe size equals the change in rock-climbing shoe size. Therefore, Adina's rock-climbing shoe size equals her normal shoe size plus the change in shoe size. The change in shoe size for Lynn is 33, so it will be the same for Adina: 6 + x, where x = 33. It is equal to 39. So Adina's rock-climbing shoe size is 39.\n#### Final Answer: The final answer is 36. I hope it is correct.",
