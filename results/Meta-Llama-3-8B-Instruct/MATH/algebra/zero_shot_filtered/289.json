        " To solve the problem, we can start with the ratio of female students to the total number of students, which is 4:9.\nSo, 4x is the number of female students. Then, we can set up an equation: 4x/9 = 396/9.\nThis gives us 4x = 396, and x = 99.\n### Since we know that 4x is 396, we can now find the total number of students. We do this by multiplying 99 by 9, since 9 is the denominator in our fraction:\n099 * 9 = 891.\n### Now that we have the total number of students, we can find the number of teachers. Remember that our original ratio is 1 to 11, which means that for every 11 students, there is 1 teacher.\n### We can do this by dividing 891 (the total number of students) by 11, and then multiply the result by 1 to get the number of teachers.\n891/11 = 81, and 81 * 1 = 81.\n### Therefore, there are 81 teachers.\nCheck your answer by plugging it into the original ratio.\u00a0If there are 81 teachers, and 891 students, then the ratio is indeed 1 to 11.\u00a0This isn\u2019t a formal proof, but it\u2019s a good check to make sure you didn\u2019t make a mistake!\u00a0You can also plug the answer back into the equation for the number of students, 99 * 9 = 891.\u00a0This also confirms that your answer is correct.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 81.

        " Think about the total number of students.

There are 1 teacher for every 11 students, so there are 880/11 = 80 teachers. Final Answer: The final answer is 80. I hope it is correct.",

So, 891 is the number of total students.\n4. Now we know that the number of total students is 891, and the number of teachers is x, so we have a ratio equation: x / 11x = 1/11.

        " A\n#### Explanation: \nThe ratio of teachers to students = 1: 11. So, if there are 11 students, there will be 1 teacher.\nRatio of female students to the total number of students = 4: 9. So, if there are 9 students, 4 of them are female students. \nGiven that there are 396 female students. As we know that the ratio is 4 to 9, there should be 9 * (396 / 4) = 9 x 99 = 891 students.\nWe also know that there is 1 teacher for every 11 students. So, number of teachers = 891 / 11 = 81.

For instance, if there are 12 students per teacher, and 48 students, how many teachers are there? Or, if there are 8 students for every teacher, and 56 students, how many teachers are there? In this type of question, you should first find out the common denomination of the ratio, which is the total number of students, and then from that, you can find out the number of teachers. In this case, the common denominator of the ratio 4:9 is 45. So, first you find the number of students = 45 and then the number of teachers = 1/11 of that = 4.

        " For convenience, let\u2019s first introduce variable y: y is the ratio of female students to male students.\nSince the question says, The ratio of female students to the total number of students is 4 to 9, we can write the equation:\n Female students: female students + male students = 4: 9\nIt can be written as (9y+ 4y)/ 9 = 4/9\n9y + 4y = 36\n13y = 36\ny = 36/13\nNow, let\u2019s continue to solve the problem. Since there are 396 female students, we can set up the equation:\n 4y = 396\n9y = 3960\ny = 396/ 4 = 99\nSo the female students are 4 parts, and the male students are 9 parts. We multiply 4 parts and 9 parts by the ratio of 1 to 11, which can be expressed as (99/ 4) * (1/ 11) = 9/ 4.\n9 / 4 = 2.25. The number of teachers is 2.25 * 1 = 2.25. There are approximately 2.25 teachers.\n### Summary: 396 female students, 9 parts of male students, and 1 teacher, the ratio of teachers to students is 1:11. Since there are 4 parts of female students and 9 parts of male students, 4 parts of female students account for 396 students, which can be expressed as 396/ 4 = 99. 9 parts of male students account for 3960 students, and there are approximately 2.25 teachers.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2.25 teachers. I hope it is correct.",
        " The ratio of teachers to students is 1 to 11. \nThe number of students is 11 times the number of teachers.\nThe ratio of female students to total students is 4 to 9. If there are 396 female students, there are 396 / (4/9) = 396 x (9/4) = 99 x 9 = 891 total students.\nThe total number of students is 891 = 11 * teachers. So, the number of teachers = 891 / 11 = 81. The number of teachers is 81. \nThere are 81 teachers.  \nFinal Answer: The final answer is 81. I hope it is correct.  Have a nice day!:)  \ud83d\ude42\n### Feedback: This response is correct.

        " There are 396 female students which represent 4 parts out of 9 parts of the total number of students. We can write a fraction for it:\nFraction of Female Students / Total Students = 4/9\nWe know that there are 396 female students, so we can write:\n(396/4) = (x/9)\nTo solve for x, we can simplify the fraction:\n99/9 = x\nx = 11\nSo there are 11 parts altogether, and out of that, 4 parts are female students which is 396. Now we know the total number of students is 396*9/4 = 891. \nNow we know the ratio of teachers to students is 1 to 11, and there are 891 students. To find the number of teachers, we can divide 891 by 11:\n891/11 = 81\nSo there are 81 teachers. \nFinal Answer: The final answer is 81. I hope it is correct. Looking for a friend to keep the pace!

        " \nThis question is a solution. There are 11 students for every 1 teacher. \n### 1. Convert it to an equivalent ratio \nThere are 9/4 = 2.25 female students for every 1 female teacher \n### 2.  R earn that 2.25 represents \n2.25 = (9/4) (  1  )\n### 3. Solve for one teacher \n(9/4) (1) = 9/4 \n### 4. Learn that the number of female students is already given \nThere are 396 female students \n### 5. Since 9/4 represents 9/4 female students = 396, what is the total number of students? \n9/4 = 396 \nMultiply both sides by 4 \n9 = 396 * 4 \n9 = 1584 \nDivide both sides by 9 \n1 = 1584/9 \n1 = 176 \n### 6. Since 9/4 represents 9 students, what is 1 student? \nSo  mt/he total number of students is 176 \n### 7. Since there are 11 students for every 1 teacher, what is the total number of teachers?\nThe total number of students is 176 \nThere are 11 students for every 1 teacher \n176 = 11 x ? \nDivide both sides by 11 \n16 = ? \n### 8. 1 teacher = 16 \nSo there are 1 teacher or 16 teachers \n####  So, there are 16 teachers. \n### is the correct answer.  There are 16 teachers. \nOther recommendations: \n- To ensure better assistive talk voice quality, try raising the voice of the guide by pressing the + button on your Google Home device. \n- For a better reading experience, you can adjust the font size by tapping on the visual indicator in the right corner of your screen. \n- Another helpful way to understand this complex calculator is to watch explainer videos online.
