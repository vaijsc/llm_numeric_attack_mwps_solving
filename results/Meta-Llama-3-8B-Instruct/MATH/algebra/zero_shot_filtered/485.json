Kim has exactly enough money to buy 40 oranges at $3x$ cents each. If the price rose to $4x$ cents per orange, how many oranges could she buy?  Let\u2019s calculate how much money Kim has.

So, we calculate \\begin{align*} \\text{Money}&=(40)\\cdot(3x)\\\\ &=120x \\end{align*} As the amount of money Kim has remains the same, we set it equal to the amount of money she would have if she were to buy the same number of oranges at the new price, $4x$ cents each.

        " $40$ oranges $\\cdot$ $3x$ cents $= 120000$\nThat means Kim has $120000$ cents or $$1200$$. Let\u2019s denote with $n$ the number of oranges that Kim can buy with this money. We know that $n * 4x = 1200$. $$n * 4x = 120000$$\nSince $n * 4x$ is equal to $120000$, then we divide both sides of the equation by $4x$ to get $$n = \\frac{120000}{4x}$$\n$$n = 30000/x$$. So now we plug in the values. Possible values of $$x$$ are 3, 6, 12, and 24. If we take $$x=3$$, then $$n=30000/3=10000$$. Not possible because this is 100 oranges, but we can buy only 40. Second guess is $$x=6$$.\n$$n=30000/6=5000$$. Not possible.\nThird guess $$x=12$$.\n$$n=30000/12=2500$$. Not possible.\nLast guess is $$x=24$$.\n$$n=30000/24=1250$$. Not possible. The next guess is $$x=1$$ but then $$n=30000$$. Not possible. So, the next guess is $$x=2$$.\n$$n=30000/2=15000$$. Not possible. Now we get $$x=1/2$$.\n$$n=30000*2=60000$$. Not possible.

        " Suppose 40 oranges at $3x$ cents each cost a total of $T$ cents. Then we can set up the equation $40\\cdot3x=T$.

If the price rises to $4x$ cents per orange, then $T$ will be four times as large if she buys the same number of oranges.  Otherwise, we will have $T$ as the total cost of buying $n$ oranges; the cost per orange is $4x$.\nSince the total cost of 40 oranges is $T$, we can form a similar equation for $n$: $$n\\cdot4x=T.$$  In order to find $n$, we can simply divide both sides of this equation by $4x$: \\begin{align*}\nn\\cdot4x&=T\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=\\frac{T}{4x}=\\frac{40\\cdot3x}{4x}=\\boxed{30}.\n\\end{align*}\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 30.

Therefore, we can conclude that after the price rise, 40 oranges would cost$\\frac{3,200}{40}=80$cents. This means that Kim could buy 40 oranges for 80 cents. Now we need to find the number of oranges that she could buy. If the price is$ 80$cents, then the number of oranges that she will buy is equal to 40. In fact, any price less than that would not change the number of oranges that she will buy. So the number of oranges that she could buy is$40$. We know that Kim has exactly enough money to buy 40 oranges at$3x$cents each. If the price rose to$4x$cents per orange, how many oranges could she buy? In this case, 40.  Final Answer: The final answer is 40. I hope it is correct.  ### Related questions #### Already know the answer?#### Trying to solve this question?  Back Go to ",

        " Suppose the oranges at original price of $3x$ cents is $O_1$ and the oranges at new price of $4x$ cents is $O_2$. We can set up a proportion equation:\n\\begin{matrix}\n\\frac{O_1}{40} &=& \\frac{3x}{O_1x} \\\\\n&=& \\frac{O_2}{O_2x}\n\\end{matrix}\nWe can simplify the equation:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\Rightarrow O_1 &= 40 \\cdot \\frac{3x}{x} \\\\\n&= 120 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow O_2 &= 40 \\cdot \\frac{4x}{x} \\\\\n&= 160\n\\end{align*}\nTherefore, the number of oranges Kim can buy with the same amount of money is $\\boxed{160/3}$.

        " First, let\u2019s find the total amount of money she can spend. Kim has enough money to buy 40 oranges for  $3x$ cents each, so she has 40($3x$) cents.   Now, we have to convert this to cents .  We can do the conversion since we are multiplying by cents. 40($3x$)\n(Skip)\n(cents $$,$$ cents$$,,$let me check length of rhyme)\ncents$$,$$  We can now find the number of times she can buy the oranges for$4x$cents per orange by dividing the total amount of money Kim has, in cents, by the price of each orange, in cents, after the price rise. She will be able to buy  ; by dividing 40($3x$) by 4x .  We got the answer, let\u2019s check. (cents \\$,  \\Ask the Palindrome)cents\\$ !\n### Final Answer: The final answer is 30. I hope it is correct.### Explanation:Before the price rise, Kim could spend \\$12(the total amount of money she could spend) on oranges that cost 3x dollars each.  So, if you let x be the amount of money that Kim had, she could spend 40 times x cents.  So, we can figure out what x is. Then, after the price rose to 4x dollars per orange, she could not afford to buy as many oranges.  How many oranges could she still buy?   We know she could spend 40 times x cents, which is 12.  So,$$\\begin{gather*} 40x = 12,000\\\\ x = 300 \\end{gather*}$$Finally, she could afford to buy 1 / 4 x times as many oranges at 4x dollars per orange as she could at the old price.  So, the number of oranges she could buy is 40 x 300 / 4 = 30. now It\u2019s Kim. would you like to share how many oranges I can buy if the price goes up another 50 cents?vertisementscdot Ki Guess What?contributionsTable of Content: page 1: introduction.page 2: calculations.page 3: explanation of the problem.page 4: conclusion.page 5: next question .PAGE 1: INTRODUCTION KIM HAS EXACTLY ENOUGH  INCOME TO BUY 40 ORANGES AT3X CENTS EACH.",
        " Let\u2019s calculate how much money Kim has to spend first.\nSince Kim can buy 40 oranges at $3x$ cents each, we can represent this fact with the equation $3x\\cdot40 = k$, where $k$ is the money Kim has.  We know that $\\$k$is the equivalent of$\\frac{300x}{100}=\\frac{3x}{10}$cents.  Now, let\u2019s use this $$3x(40) = \\frac{3x}{10},$$ and solve for$x$:$300x=30x$, and so$x=100$cents.  Since the amount of money in 100 cents is$\\$1$, Kim has \\$1.\nNow, we need to find out how many oranges she can buy when the price rose to $4x$cents per orange.  If we substitute$x=100$c, we obtain the equation $4x\\cdot y = 1000$, where$y$is the number of oranges Kim can buy.  Multiplying both sides of the equation by$\\frac{1}{4}$, we can solve for$y$:$y = \\frac{1000}{4} = 250,$ so Kim can buy$\\boxed{250}$oranges at that price. Final Answer: The final answer is 250. I hope it is correct.  I found an alternative solution, which was another way to solve the problem.  It was to use the fact that Kim can buy 40 oranges at \\$3x$cents per orange.  This tells us that she has paid a total of$3x\\cdot 40 = 120x$cents.  This means that she has$s = 120x$cents.  If the price rises to$4x$cents per orange, then the amount of money that she has will be spent at a rate of$4x$cents per orange.  Therefore, the number of oranges she can buy is$$y=\\frac{120x}{4x}=\\boxed{30}.$$This alternative solution is more quick and efficient than the initial solution, and both solutions can be used to solve the problem. Final Answer: The final answer is 30. I hope it is correct.  (again, I hope it is correct, but the two solutions I provided have different answers.  I hope this issue was resolved in the provided answer, which was the combination of the two solutions).  From my perspective, both answers appear to be",
        " \nWe start by identifying the variables. We are given that Kim has enough money to buy 40 oranges at $3x$ cents each. We are also given that the price rose to $4x$ cents per orange. We can use this information to set up the following system of linear equations:\n\\begin{align*}\n40\\cdot 3x &= M\\\\\n40\\cdot 4x &= y\n\\end{align*} where $M$ is Kim\u2019s total money and $y$ is the total number of oranges she can buy at the new price.\nWe can simplify each equation by dividing both sides by $40$:\n\\begin{align*}\n3x &= \\frac{M}{40}\\\\\n4x &= \\frac{y}{40}\n\\end{align*}\nNow we can use the information that Kim has enough money to buy 40 oranges at $3x$ cents each. This means that\n$$M = 40\\cdot 3x.$$Substituting this expression for $M$ into the equation $4x = \\frac{y}{40}$, we obtain\n$$4x = \\frac{40\\cdot 3x}{40}.$$Simplifying this equation, we can solve for $x$:\n\\begin{align*}\n4x &= 3x\\\\\nx &= 3\n\\end{align*}\nThis means that the new price is $4x = 4(3) = 12$ cents per orange. Hence, the number of oranges Kim can buy at the new price is\n$$\\frac{y}{40} = \\frac{4x}{40} = \\frac{4(3)}{40} = \\frac{12}{40} = \\boxed{0.30}.$$\nTherefore, Kim can buy $\\boxed{30}$ oranges at the new price.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 30.
