        " $\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt6-\\sqrt2}{4}}$.\nBy looking at the numerator and denominator of the rationalized expression, we can tell that the analytic expression obtained\u00a0 is $\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt6-\\sqrt2}{4}}$.\nThat's it. Is there anything else? Read on!\nIt looks like we're done here! So, it's time to end our lesson.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\frac{\\sqrt6-\\sqrt2}{4}. I hope it is correct.  Note that the final answer is different from the Kuta Software answer.  We use a different method here which seems more correct.  There are many ways to rationalize denominators.  The procedure on our website can be used to avoid complex quotient problems when attempting to rationalize denominators.  It is a great way to approach these problems, especially when you are taking quizzes online.  Don't forget to review this method and apply it to your other problems.  Don't ask us where the math is from.  Just use and solve your math problems like a chess player.  We have the best methods!  For now, we will end here.  Good luck with your math homework and quizzes!  Enjoy!  Thank you for participating in our lesson.  Your feedback is highly appreciated.  Send your feedback to our website.  That's it.  Bye!  ### Plug and Chug Procedure To Rationalize Denominators: \n1. Multiply the fraction by 1 in the form $a+b\\sqrt c$, where $c$ is the radicand in the denominator.\n2. Make sure to multiply all parts of the fraction, including the denominator, by $a+b\\sqrt c$.\n3. Simplify the numerator and denominator, when applicable.\n4. Be sure to keep the denominator in its simplified form.",
