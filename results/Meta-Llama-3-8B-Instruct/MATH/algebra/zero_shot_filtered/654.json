We can continue in this manner until we are convinced that our answer is correct. \u2022 Another way to check is to think about the problem in a different way. For example, we could think about the composition of functions instead of using the definition of $g(x)$. This is clean and a bit more straightforward. \u2022 Finally, we can check it is true geometrically by plotting some points on the graph of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, which might give some confidence, without double-checking.

Here are the reasons why:\n1. **Trying to divide a string by a module**: The `'math'` module is not a scalar value, it's a Python package that contains various mathematical functions. You can't divide a scalar value (like a string) by a module.\n2. **Using a string where a variable is expected**: `pi` is treated as a string literal, not a variable. In Python, when you see a string literal, the interpreter thinks you're trying to create a new string object.\nTo get the value of Pi, you should use the `math` module correctly:\n```python\nimport math\npi = math.pi\nprint(pi)  # Output: 3.14159265359\n```\nBy the way, your original code has another issue: the semicolon `;` is not a valid syntax in Python. Python uses indentation to denote code blocks, not semicolons. You should use indentation to define your code blocks instead.[:]([`import clr; clr.AddReference(\"ClRExec\")`])  No references were added.\nThe `clr.AddReference` method is used to add a reference to an assembly (a .NET DLL) in the current app domain.

        " In order to find $g(g(2))$, we first must find $g(2)$, which we get by plugging 2 into $g(x)$:\\begin{align*} g(2)&=f(2\\cdot 2) - 3\\\\ &= 2(2\\cdot 2) + 1 - 3\\\\ &= 8 + 1 - 3\\\\ &= 6 \\end{align*}Next, we plug 6 into $g(x)$ to get\n\\begin{align*} g(6)&=f(2\\cdot6) - 3\\\\ &= 2(2\\cdot6)+1 - 3\\\\ &= 24+1-3\\\\ &= 22 \\end{align*}We can tell that our function is really a scaling of the input to the right with a factor of 2, then adding 1. Therefore, we can see that 2 is the focal point of the function.  For this reason, all positive values of will be mapped to values greater than 2, but negative values of will be mapped to values less than 2.$g(g(2))=g(6)=22.$Final Answer: The final answer is 22.
