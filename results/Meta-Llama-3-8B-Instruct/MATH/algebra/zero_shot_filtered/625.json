As such, a solid understanding of mathematical concepts is essential for success in a wide range of careers. The IB Diploma Programme has a strong emphasis on math studies. The curriculum in math studies is designed to develop students' understanding of mathematical concepts and their applications in real-world contexts. The programme is divided into three main areas of study: number and algebra, geometry and trigonometry, and data management and probability. Students also have the opportunity to develop their problem-solving skills through the completion of mathematics investigations. These investigations require students to identify and formulate a problem, gather and analyze data, and present their findings. Through this hands-on approach to learning, students develop a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts and learn to apply them in a variety of contexts. In addition to the three main areas of study, students also have the opportunity to develop their understanding of mathematical concepts through the completion of extended essays. These essays require students to research and analyze a specific topic related to math. By the end of the programme, students are expected to have a comprehensive understanding of mathematical concepts and be able to apply them in a variety of contexts. They are also expected to be able to communicate their understanding of mathematical concepts clearly and effectively.",

I hope it is correct.  In this case, the other cone has a radius that is $1 / 3$ of the radius of the larger cone, which is the radius $r$ divided by $3$; namely, by $r/3$.
