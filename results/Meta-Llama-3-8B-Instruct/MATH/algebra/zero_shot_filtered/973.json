        " A rectangle has 2 length sides and 2 width sides, so its perimeter is:\n2length + 2width = 100\nNow, length is four times the width, so length = 4 * width. \u00a0We know that:\n2width + 2(4 * width) = 100\nCombine like terms:\n2width + 8width = 100\nCombine again:\n10width = 100\nNow, divide by 10:\nwidth = 10\nFinally, the length is four times the width, so the length is:\nlength = 4 * 10 = 40\nThis means that the area of the rectangle is:\narea = length * width = 40 * 10 = 400\n### Answer: The area of the rectangle is 400 square centimeters.\u00a0(Determine whether the answer is reasonable.)

        "    \nThe length is four times the width, so the length, (L), can be written as 4w, where w is the width. The perimeter of a rectangle is two times the length plus two times the width. Since the perimeter is 100, we can write 2(4w) + 2w = 100.\nWe can combine like terms on the left: 2(4w) + 2w = 8w + 2w = 10w. So, we have 10w = 100.\nTo solve for w, we can divide both sides of the equation by 10. This gives us w = 100/10 = 10.\nNow that we have the width, we can find the length (4w) by multiplying the width by 4. 4w = 4(10) = 40. So, the length is 40.\nThe area of a rectangle is the width times the length, so the area is 10 times 40. 10 times 40 is 400. So, the area is 400 square centimeters.\nThe number of square centimeters in the area of the rectangle is 400.

Let w be the width of the rectangle.\n2. The length of the rectangle is equal to four times its width, which is 4w.\n3. The perimeter of the rectangle is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. The formula for perimeter of a rectangle is p = 2(l) + 2(w), where l is the length and w is the width. \n4. Substitute l = 4w into the formula for perimeter: p = 2(4w) + 2w = 10w.\n5. We are given that the perimeter of the rectangle is 100 cm. So, set the expression for the perimeter equal to 100 and solve for w: 10w = 100.\n6. Solve for w: w = 100 / 10 = 10.\n7. Since w is the width of the rectangle, the width is 10 cm. The length is four times its width, which is 4(10) = 40 cm.\n8. Find the area of the rectangle by multiplying the width and length: Area = w \u00d7 l = 10 \u00d7 40 = 400.\nThe area of the rectangle is 400 square centimeters.\n### Keywords: \nrectangle, perimeter, width, length, area, solve for x, algebraic solution, mathematical problem, rectangular shape.  ######\n<!-- BEGIN TIMESTAMPS -->\n<!-- 2021-12-31  |\n  END TIMESTAMPS -->\n_share this explanation on social media or email it to a friend, colleague or family member who might find it helpful_ \nHave any questions or need help on this topic?

        " 400\n### Solution:\nThe question is asking to find the area of the rectangle. The area of a rectangle is the product of its length and width, or, in equation form, $L*w$.\nThe perimeter is the sum of the length and width multiplied by two, or, in equation form, $2*L+2*w$.\nGiven that the perimeter is 100 centimeters, we have that $2*L+2*w=100$.\nDividing both sides of this equation by 2, we get $L+w=50$.\nNow, the length is four times the width. This means that the length can be written as $L=4*w$.\nSubstituting this in the equation $L+w=50$, we have that $4*w+w=50$. Moving the $w$ to the left side, we get $5*w=50$. Dividing both sides of this equation by 5, we get $w=10$.\nSo, the width is 10 centimeters, and the length is 4*w=40 centimeters.\nThe area of the rectangle, $L*w$, is equal to 10*40=400 square centimeters. Therefore, the number of square centimeters in the area of the rectangle is 400.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 400. I hope it is correct. ### Share this: Categories Share this: Like Liked by 1 person ### Leave a comment Cancel response Your email address will not be published.

        " First, we note that if the rectangle has width w, then its length is 4w. The perimeter is then P = 2w + 2(4w) = 10w.\n### We are given that the perimeter is 100 cm, so 10w = 100, which implies w = 10.\n### Then, the area of the rectangle is aw = 10 * 4 * 10 = 400.\n### So, the number of square centimeters in the area of the rectangle is 400.\nIf you like, I can also give an answer in the format of code, if you are more comfortable with that:\n```\ndef rectangle_area(perimeter):\n    if perimeter == 100:\n        width = 10\n        length = 4 * width\n        return width * length\n    else:\n        return \"Invalid perimeter\"\n```\nYou can call the function with the perimeter as an argument to get the area of the rectangle:\n```\nprint(rectangle_area(100))\n```\nThis will return `400`, which is the area of the rectangle in square centimeters.",
        " Because the length is four times the width, the length is 4x. The width is x. We know the perimeter is 100 cm. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:\nPerimeter = 2(Length + Width)\n### Step 1: Perimeter formula\nPerimeter = 2(Length + Width)\n### Step 2: Convert the expression inside the parentheses\nPerimeter = 2((4x) + x)\n### Step 3: Simplify the expression inside the parentheses\nPerimeter = 2(5x)\n### Step 4: Plug in the perimeter (100 cm)\n2(5x) = 100\n### Step 5: Solve for x\nx = 20\n### Step 6: Substitute x into the length expression\nLength = 4x\nLength = 4(20)\nLength = 80 cm\n### Step 7: Calculate the width\nWidth = x\nWidth = 20 cm\n### Step 8: Find the area\nArea = Length \u00d7 Width\nArea = 80 \u00d7 20\nArea = 1600 square centimeters\n### Conclusion:\nThe number of square centimeters in the area of the rectangle is 1600. The width and length of the rectangle are both 20 cm, and the area is 1600 square centimeters. The correct response is 1600. ### Keyboard shortcuts (if you have any): Ctrl+s: Save the answer.

        " We can use variables to represent the width and length. The width is represented by w, and the length is represented by 4w. The perimeter is 100 cm and it can be written as 2w + 2(4w) or 2w + 8w. This is simplified to 10w.\n### Perimeter: 100 = 10w\nTo find the value of w, we divide both sides by 10. After doing that, w becomes 10. So the width is 10 cm. The length is 4 times the width so the length is 4 x 10 = 40 cm.\n### Area: 10 x 40 = 400\nSo the area is 400 square centimeters.

        "Let\u2019s first name some of the variables. The length of the rectangle will be $L$, and the width will be $W$. We know that the length is four times as much as the width. So $L = 4W$.

Answer:If you change the length, the area will increase or decrease by the same amount. If you change the width, the area will also increase or decrease by the same amount, but multiplied by the length. For example, if the length is 100 cm and the width is 20 cm, the area is 2000 square cm. If you increase the length by 10 cm, the area becomes 2200 square cm. If you increase the length by 30 cm, the area becomes 2500 square cm. You can find that the area changes by 200 or 300, depending on the change of the length and the width.

        " The length, L, is 4 times the width, W. Hence L = 4 * W. The perimeter is 100 cm. The perimeter of a rectangle is 2 * L + 2 * W, or P = 2L + 2 * W. So 2 * 4 * W + 2 * W = 100.
