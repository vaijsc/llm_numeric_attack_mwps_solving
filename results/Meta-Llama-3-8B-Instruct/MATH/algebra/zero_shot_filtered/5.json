        " \n#### Arithmetic Sequence\nAn arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers where each subsequent number is obtained by adding a constant to the previous number. Mathematically, the formula for an arithmetic sequence is:\na, a + d, a + 2d, a + 3d, ...\nWhere:\n- a is the first term.\n- d is the common difference, which is the amount by which each subsequent term is greater than the previous one.\n#### Problem Solving\nIn this case, we have a sequence:\n6, 10, 14, 18, ...\nThe first term is 6, and to get the second term, we add 4 to 6 (6 + 4 = 10). Similarly, to get the third term, we add 4 to 10 (10 + 4 = 14). To get the fourth term, we add 4 to 14 (14 + 4 = 18).\nSo, the common difference (d) is 4.\nNow, we need to find the 100th term. We can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence:\nan = a + (n - 1)d\nWhere:\n- a is the first term (6 in this case).\n- n is the term number (100 in this case).\n- d is the common difference (4 in this case).\nPlugging in the values:\nan = 6 + (100 - 1) \u00d7 4\nan = 6 + 99 \u00d7 4\nan = 6 + 396\nan = 402\nSo, the 100th term of the arithmetic sequence is 402.

        " \nIn this problem, we are looking for the 100th term in the arithmetic sequence. Let\u2019s start by creating a sequence starting from the given terms: 6, 10, 14, 18, ...\nIn this sequence, we notice that we are adding 4 each time: 10 - 6 = 4, 14 - 10 = 4, 18 - 14 = 4, ...\nThe pattern continues! This means we are looking for the 100th term. We simply need to add 4 as many times as there are terms before the 100th term.\nWe have: 6, 10, 14, 18, ... Seeking the 100th term, we do the following: 6 + 4 = 10, 10 + 4 = 14, 14 + 4 = 18, 18 + 4 = 22, ...",
        " \nWell, let's identify the simple pattern in the given sequence: each term differs from the previous one by 4.

        " \nLet's figure out the common difference between consecutive terms. \nWe have 10 - 6 = 4 and 14 - 10 = 4, so the common difference is 4. \nTo find the 100th term of the sequence, we need to find \nthe 100th term formula, which is a1 + (100-1) * d, where a1 is the first term and d is the common difference. \nSo, the formula is 6 + (100-1) * 4 = 414. \nTherefore, 414 is the 100th term of the sequence. \nFinal Answer: The final answer is 414. I hope it is correct. \nOr, alternatively, if you understand that the common difference is 4, then you can use the formula for an arithmetic sequence, which is an = a1 + (n-1) * d. \nThen, substitute the values of a1 = 6 and d = 4. \nSo, the formula becomes 6 + (n-1) * 4. \nWe can rearrange the formula by subtracting 6 from both sides. \nThen, the formula becomes 4(n-1). \nNext, we can add 6 to both sides to get \n4(n-1) + 6 = 4n + 2. \nSo, for the 100th term, we substitute n = 100 into the formula. \nThen, we get \n4(100-1) + 6 = 4 * 99 + 6 = 396. \nAfter applying the arithmetic operations, we finally get 396 as the 100th term. \nFinal Answer: The final answer is 414.

Now, you want to find the 100th term. To do this, you have to add 4 to 6 99 times and add 4 to the result. But remember, you want the 100th term! So, you need to take 6 and add 4 to it 99 times, then add one more 4.\n4.

Here, the common difference is 4 (`10 - 6 = 4`, `14 - 10 = 4`, `18 - 14 = 4`, ...). Looking for a way to calculate the 100th term, we can think `a = 6`, `d = 4`, and `n = 100`.

This gives `a + (100-1)*4 = 6 + 99*4 = 6 + 396 = 402`, which is the wrong answer. Let's try again: `a + (n-1)d = a_n` where `a` is `6`, `n` is `100`, and `d` is `4`. We recheck: `6 + (100-1)*4 = 6 + 99*4 = 6 + 396 = 402`. No that is again wrong. Corrected step 1: convert arithmetic progression to a quadratic equation using the T_n formula. Analyze step 2: Term `a_n = a + (n-1)d = 6 + (100-1)*4 = 6 + 99*4 = 6 + 396 = 402. And then convert polynomial expansion = axe + bx + c and isolate value of a.

        " The difference between each term is 4.\nThe formula for an arithmetic sequence is: $$a_n=a_1 + (n-1)d$$\nWhere $$a_n$$ is the nth term, $$a_1$$ is the first term, and $$d$$ is the difference between each term.\nIn this case, we know that $$a_1 = 6$$ and $$d = 4$$. So, the 100th term is: $$a_{100} = 6 + (100-1)(4) = 6 + 396 = 402$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 402. I hope it is correct. ### ",
        " 126\nThere are a few steps to solve this problem:\n1. Look at the sequence. The common difference is 4 (10 - 6 = 14 - 10 = 18 - 14 = 4).\n2. Use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: a(n) = a + (n-1)*d.\n3. Plug in the values. We know that a(1) = 6 (the first term), and d = 4 (the common difference).\na(n) = 6 + (n-1)*4\n= 6 + 4n - 4\n= 2 + 4n\nWe want to find a(100), the 100th term of the sequence.

Then, we would add 6 to 396. This would give t100 = 402.",

        " We are asking for the 100th term of the sequence 6, 10, 14, 18, ... . So the formula for the sequence is: $a_ {n} = 6 + 4(n - 1) = 4n + 2$.

Knowing is the key to solve this problem, it is one of the most important things in math. But there are also other ways to solve the problem, it depends on your current level of math knowledge. ### Comment/Feedback: Good job! Your work is clear and understandable. Well done! It's great that you were able to use the formula for an arithmetic sequence to solve the problem. Keep up the good work! Do you think this problem could be solved in other ways, besides using the formula for an arithmetic sequence? For example, could it be solved using mental math or estimation techniques? Why or why not? Share your thoughts! I think that this problem could be solved using mental math, by observing the pattern of the sequence, and using the differences between consecutive terms to find the next term. For example, we know that 6 + 4 = 10, and 10 + 4 = 14, so 14 + 4 = 18. We can keep doing this to mentally calculate the next few terms, and then estimate the 100th term. This approach may not be as accurate as using the formula, but it could be a good way to solve the problem, at least approximately. What do you think? Do you have any other ideas for solving this problem? ### Other suggestions or additional problems to try:\n1. Provide examples of other arithmetic sequences to solve.\n2.

        " using\nThe given terms are an arithmetic sequence. The first and the last terms are given as 6 and 16 respectively.\nTo find the $n^{th}$ term of an arithmetic sequence, we use the formula:\n$$a_n=a_1+(n-1)d$$\nwhere $a_n$ is the $n^{th}$ term, $a_1$ is the first term, $d$ is the common difference, and $n$ is the term number.\nWe know the first term is 6 and the last term is 16. To find the common difference:\n$$d=a_2-a_1=10-6=4$$\nSo the $n^{th}$ term is:\n$$a_n=6+(n-1)4=4n+2$$\nTo find the 100th term, we substitute $n=100$:\n$$a_{100}=4(100)+2=400+2=\\boxed{402}$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 402.

        " A methodical approach is to find the common difference between each consecutive pair of numbers. Here, the first difference between 10 and 6 is 4. So, we can find each subsequent term by adding this difference.\n### ",
        " The easiest way to find the 100th term is to first find the common difference. We can use the first two terms in the sequence to do this. We have:\nd = differencce between first two terms = (10 - 6) = 4",
        " \nLet\u2019s identify the common difference (d) first. To do so, we can subtract the first term from the second term and get 10 - 6 = 4. So, d = 4.\nNow we can find the 100th term (a100) by using the formula: a100 = a1 + (100 - 1) \u00d7 d, where a1 is the first term (6) and d is the common difference (4).\nWe can plug in these values and simplify: a100 = 6 + (100 - 1) \u00d7 4 = 6 + (99) \u00d7 4 = 6 + 396 = 402.\nSo, the 100th term of the arithmetic sequence is 402.

The common difference (d) is the constant value that is added to the previous term to get the next term.\nThe formula to find the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is:\na_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d\nwhere a_n is the nth term, a_1 is the first term, and d is the common difference.",

        " 126\nThe first term is 6, the difference between the first and second terms is 10-6=4, and the difference between the second and third terms is 14-10=4. \nSo, the constants of the arithmetic sequence are a = 6 and d = 4.\nTo find the 100th term, we use the formula a + (n-1)d. \nIn this case, a = 6 and n = 100. \n6 + (100-1)4 = 6 + 99(4) = 6 + 396 = 402, not 126. \nPlease make sure you understand your choices before choosing an answer.\nI recommend that you choose 402 as your answer.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 402.
