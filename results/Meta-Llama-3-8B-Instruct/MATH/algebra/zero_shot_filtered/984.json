The points on the unit circle are in the form (x,y)= (a, sqrt(1-a^2)) for some integer a satisfying 0, for some integer r. The equation 1 = (a)^2 + (sqrt(1-a^2))^2 = a^2 + ",
        " $2a + b$\nWe want to find out the value of $2a + b$ given that\n$2z^2+13z+21$ = $(z + a)(2z + b)$. If we expand the right-hand side of this equation, we get\n$(z + a)(2z + b)$ = $2z^2 + 2az + bz + ab$ = $2z^2 + (2a + b)z + ab$ (1).\nEquating coefficients of the $z^2$ term on both sides, we get $2 = 2$, and equating coefficients of the $z$ term, we get\n$2a + b = 13$.\nNow, equating the constant terms, we get $ab = 21$. With the help of this information, we can try out values of $a$ and $b$.\n\u2022 If $a = 1$, then $b = 21$ by the above equation. Then $2a + b = 2 + 21 = 23$.\n\u2022 If $a = 3$, then $b = 7$ by the above equation. Then $2a + b = 6 + 7 = 13$.\n\u2022 If $a = 7$, then $b = 3$ by the above equation. Then $2a + b = 14 + 3 = 17$.\n\u2022 If $a = 21$, then $b = 1$ by the above equation. Then $2a + b = 42 + 1 = 43$.\nNone of these values equal 13, so we can conclude that $a \\neq 1, 3, 7, 21$. So we have that $ab = 21$, and $a$ and $b$ are not equal. Since neither $a$ nor $b$ is negative, then $a \\geq 1$ and $b \\geq 1$.\nIf $a = 2$, then $b = 21/2 = 10$ with $2a + b = 4 + 10 = 14$. If $a = 3$, then $b = 21/3 = 7$ with $2a + b = 6 + 7 = 13$.\nWe conclude that $a = 3$ and $b = 7$. Therefore, we have $",

If we draw an algebraic ceiling, i.e., $a$ times the polynomial factor and $b$ times the constant factor, it becomes simpler.\n$2z^2+13z+21=(z+a)2z+b$ is a similar factoring:\nFactoring out $z$ gives us $(z)(2z+13)+21=z(2z+13)+21$. Distributing the $z$ to the polynomial factor we get $2z^2+13z+21=z(2z+13)+21$. This makes $13=z(2+1)=z(3)$, i.e., $z=13/3$. This makes $a=z=13/3$.\n$13=z(2+1)=2z+13=2(13/3)+13=26/3+3\\cdot4=2(3)+4+13=13z+21\\Rightarrow2a + b = 2(13/3)+13=26/3+26/3+13=2(2+13)+13=-50/3+26=49-16/3+1/3=49-50/3+1/3=48/3$, which means $2a + b$ equals $\\boxed{16}$.
