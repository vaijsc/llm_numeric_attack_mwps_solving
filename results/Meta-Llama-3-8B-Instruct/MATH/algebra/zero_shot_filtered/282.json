    "solution": "$f(g(x))$ must have a degree of 8, because it will produce the term with the greatest exponent of the polynomial. Because $f(x)$ is a degree 4 polynomial, we can write that $f(x)=bx^4+cx^3+dx^2+ex+f$. The term with the greatest exponent in $f(g(x))$ comes from taking $bx^4$ or $b(g(x))^4$. Let $g(x)=a_{n}x^{n}+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+...+a_{2}x^{2}+a_{1}x^{1}+a_0$. Then, the highest degree term of $f(g(x))$ is $b(a_nx^n)^4$, which equals $ba_{n}^4x^{4n}$. Since the degree of $h$ is 8, we have $4n=8$, so $n=2$.  Therefore, the degree of $g$ is $\\boxed{2}$.",

The term that contributes to the degree 8 of $h(x)$ comes from term of the same degree in $f(g(x))$ being added to the term of degree $1$ in $g(x)$.  That is, we have terms of degree $8-1=7$ in $g(x)$ being added to terms of degree $8$ in $f(g(x))$.\n### ",
        " Suppose that the degree of $f(x)$ is 4 and the degree of $h(x)$ is 8.  We know that the degree of $f(g(x))$ is the same as the degree of $g(x)$ since polynomials are composed of one factor in it.  So, the degree of $f(g(x))$ is 8 means that we know $g(x)$ is at least degree of 8.  Then, $g(x)$ could not be less than 8.\nIf the degree of $g(x)$ is 8, then the degree of $f(g(x))$ will definitely be 8.  We add another polynomial degree 1, which is $g(x)$.  So, we get the degree of $h(x)$ to be 8 as well.  This is the same case as $g(x)$ is 8.  So, the degree of $g(x)$ must be at least 8. \nIf the degree of $g(x)$ is more than 8, then we have bad things.  We start with $f(g(x))$ with degree 8.  But now that $g(x)$ has degree bigger than 8, we get even more degrees, because we multiply it.  So, the degree of $f(g(x))$ is more than 8.  Even worse, we add another polynomial $g(x)$, which also has degree bigger than 8.  So, the degree of $h(x)$ is more than 8, which contradicts the fact that the degree of $h(x)$ is 8.\n### Final Answer: The final answer is 8. I hope it is correct.

        " The degree of $h(x)$ is the maximum of the degrees of $f(g(x))$ and $g(x)$.  Since the degree of $f(x)$ is $4$, the degree of $f(g(x))$ is $\\deg f(\\deg g(x))$, or $4\\cdot \\deg g(x)$.  Since the degree of $h(x)$ is $8$, either $\\deg f(\\deg g(x))=8$ or $\\deg g(x)=8$.  The degree of $f(x)$ is greater than $2$, so it can\u2019t be the case that $\\deg g(x)=2$, so $\\deg g(x)=\\boxed{2}$.\n#### Explanation\nThe key idea here is to think about the degrees of the terms of $h(x)$.  If we have\n$$h(x) = f(g(x)) + g(x),$$then we know that the highest-degree term in $h(x)$ must come from either $f(g(x))$ or $g(x)$.  Therefore, the degree of $h(x)$ is at least the degree of the highest-degree term in each of these two parts.\nLooking at the degree of $f(g(x))$, we know that the degree of $f(x)$ is $4$, so by the Chain Rule, the degree of $f(g(x))$ is $4\\cdot \\deg g(x)$.  Therefore, the degree of the highest-degree term in $f(g(x))$ is also $4\\cdot \\deg g(x)$.  Now, if the degree of $h(x)$ is $8$, then either this term with degree $4\\cdot \\deg g(x)$ is the highest-degree term, or the highest-degree term already belongs to $g(x)$.  Since we know that the degree of $f(x)$ is greater than $2$, we know that $\\deg g(x)$ must be at least $2$, otherwise the degree of $f(g(x))$ and hence $h(x)$ would be at most $2$.  Therefore, the only possibility is that $\\deg g(x)$ is equal to $2$.  We confirm this by noting that when $\\deg g(x) = 2$, the degree of $f(g(x))$ is $8$, so it is possible that this term is the highest-degree term in $h(x)$.  On the other hand, if $\\deg g(x) > 2$, it would be impossible",
        " \nWe start by focusing on what we know about the degree of $h(x)$.  The degree of $h(x)$ is the degree of the sum of $f(g(x))$ and $g(x)$.  Since the degree of $f(x)$ is $4$, the degree of $f(g(x))$ is either $4$ (if the degree of $g(x)$ is $4$ or less) or greater than $4$ (if the degree of $g(x)$ is greater than $4$).\nBecause the degree of $h(x)$ is greater than $4$, the degree of $f(g(x))$ is greater than $4$.  A polynomial of degree $4$ added to another polynomial of degree $n$ will result in a polynomial of degree at most $\\max(4,n)$.  Since the degree of $f(g(x))$ is greater than $4$ and the degree of $g(x)$ is $n$, we see that $n\\ge 4$ and therefore the degree of $g(x)$ is at least $\\boxed{4}$.  Since the degree of $h(x)$ is $8$, the degree of $f(g(x))$ is at least $8$ as well.  If $8$ were the degree of $g(x)$, then the degree of $h(x)$ would be less than $8$ since the degree of $f(g(x))$ is $8$ and the degree of $g(x)$ is $8$.  It does not make sense for a quantity to be equal to something greater than itself, so $g(x)$ must have degree greater than $8$.  The degree of $g(x)$ could be $8$, but for the ease of the problem, we will say the degree of $g(x)$ is at least $9$.  Then, the degree of $f(g(x))$ will be $9$, which contradicts our earlier statement that $f(g(x))$ has degree greater than $4$ since $9$ is $5$ greater than $4$.  This is self-contradictory and we conclude that we must re-examine our earlier statement.\n### Record the solution at this point:\nWe know the degree of $f(g(x))$ is greater than $4$ and the degree of $g(x)$ is greater than or equal to $4$.  Let\u2019s figure out what the degree of $f(g(x))$ is",
        " Let\u2019s start by considering $g(x)$.  Since the degree of $g(x)$ is unknown, we can write it as $ax^d+\\ldots$ for some unknown constant $a$ and degree $d$.  Then $h(x)=f(g(x))+g(x)$ becomes $$h(x) = f(g(x)) + g(x) = a^4x^{4d}+\\ldots.$$Since the degree of $h(x)$ is $8$, it must be that $4d=8$, or $d=2$.  Therefore, the degree of $g(x)$ is $\\boxed{2}$.\n#### Similar Solved ",

So let\u2019s isolate $f(g(x))$:\n$$h(x)-g(x)=f(g(x))\\Leftrightarrow f(g(x))=h(x)-g(x).$$Since $h(x)-g(x)$ is a polynomial, it is easy to see that its degree is $\\boxed{\\deg(g(x)+1)}$ and $\\deg(g(x))$.\n",
        " By the sum of degrees theorem, the degree of the sum of polynomials is the highest degree that any of the factors have. We know that $h(x) = f(g(x)) + g(x)$.  Hence, by the sum of degrees theorem, the degree of $h(x)$ is equal to the higher degree of either $f(g(x))$ or $g(x)$.   In general, the degree of $f(g(x))$ cannot exceed the product of the degrees.  (Compare with this exercise.)  Hence, by the product of degrees theorem, the degree of $f(g(x))$ is the product of degrees of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$.   Since the degree of $f(x)$ is 4 and the degree of $f(g(x))$ is at least 8, then the degree of $g(x)$ must be at least 2, as otherwise the product of degrees of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ would be less than 8.\nNow, we could argue that if the degree of $g(x)$ is greater than 2, then it wouldn\u2019t have a greater degree than 8, a contradiction.  However, there is a much easier way.  If the degree of $f(g(x))$ is 8 and the degree of $f(x)$ is 4, then the degree of $g(x)$ must be 2.  To see this, the polynomial $g(x)$ could be of any degree, say $n$, higher than 2.  In that case, the polynomial $f(g(x))$ would have a degree of $4n$, which cannot be 8.  Hence, in order for the degree of $f(g(x))$ to equal 8, the degree of $g(x)$ must equal 2.   In other words, we know that the degree of $g(x)$ is $\\boxed{2}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2. I hope it is correct.  Let me know if you want to check my reasoning. I can check it and explain it better.  Just let me know! ",

Find the degree of $g(x)$ given that the degree of $h(x)$ is $8$ and the degree of $f(x)$ is $4$.\nFirstly, we can simplify $h(x)$ to be $h(x)=g(x)(f(g(x))+1)$ by performing the long division of $f(g(x))+g(x)$ by $g(x)$. Thus, the degree of $h(x)$ being 8 means that either the degree of $g(x)(f(g(x))+1)$ or the degree of $f(g(x))+1$ is 8, since these are the only factors of $h(x)$ that have a degree of 8. If $f(g(x))+1$ has degree $8$, then $f(g(x))$ must have degree 7, and therefore, $g(x)$ must have degree $4$ (since the degree of $f$ is 4), which contradicts our assumption. Thus, $g(x)(f(g(x))+1)$ must have degree 8, which implies that $g(x)$ has degree $4$ and $f(g(x))+1$ has degree $4$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 4. I hope it is correct.",

I hope it is correct.  ### Instructor's Explanation: The instructor's response is complete and correct. The solution starts by relating the degree of $h(x)$ to the degrees of $f(g(x))$ and $g(x)$. The instructor then finds the degree of $g(x)$ by analyzing two cases: when the degree of $f(g(x))$ is greater than the degree of $g(x)$, and when the degree of $g(x)$ is greater than the degree of $f(g(x))$. In the first case, the degree of $h(x)$ is the degree of $4n$, which implies that $4n=8$, so $n=2$. In the second case, the degree of $h(x)$ is the degree of $g(x)$, which implies that $n=8$, which is not possible. Since the degree of $h(x)$ is $8$, the degree of $f(g(x))$ must be $4n$, so $4n=8$, which implies that $n=\\boxed{2}$. Overall, the instructor's solution is clear and well-reasoned.  Final Answer: The final answer is 2. I hope it is correct.  ### Alternative solution  Let $p(x)$ be the degree of $f(x)$.  Since the degree of $f(g(x))$ is $",
