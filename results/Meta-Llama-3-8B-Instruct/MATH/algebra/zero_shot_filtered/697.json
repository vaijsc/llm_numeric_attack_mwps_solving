        " 6\nLet\u2019s go back to the starting condition: after the first term, each successive term is calculated by multiplying the previous term by $\\frac{m}{7}$. In other words, we know that for any term $a_k$ in the sequence, we have $a_{k+1}=\\frac{ma_k}{7}$ (for each $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$).  The key fact here is that the terms in the sequence are strictly decreasing, which means we have $a_{k+1}<a_k$ for all $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$.  So, we can rewrite this as $\\frac{ma_k}{7}<a_k \\Leftrightarrow 0<m<7.$  Since we are looking for integral values of $m$, the only possible values are $m \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$, giving a total of $\\boxed{6}$ possible integer values for $m$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 6.

If the first term of the sequence is positive, how many possible integer values are there for $m$?\nWe know that when $m=7$, the sequence becomes a constant (fixed) term because each successive term, when multiplied by $\\frac{7}{7}$, stays the same. However, since the terms are strictly decreasing, there\u2019s another possibility we haven\u2019t considered: when $m<7$.\nAfter some careful thought, we realize that when $m=1$, the terms are halved in each step. In this case, the sequence converges to 0, as expected since the terms are decreasing. For $m<1$, the terms are actually increasing instead of decreasing, because each term is being multiplied by a number greater than 1.\nTherefore, we can deduce that for the sequence to be strictly decreasing, $1<m\\le 7$. Since we are only interested in integer values of $m$, we can further narrow it down to $1<m\\le 7$, which corresponds to 6 possible integer values for $m$.

        " To answer this question, we need to give m an integer value starting from 1 and 7 (the denominator of the fraction m/7).\nSuppose the first term is a.

Therefore, $m$ is an integer less than 7.\nAnother way to think about this is that if the second term is m/7 times the first term, and m is a positive integer, then the second term is less than the first term if $m < 7$, since m/7 is less than 1 and the first term is positive.\nNow we give m the following positive integer values: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7.

        " 6\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 6. I hope it is correct. Let x_0 be the first term of our geometric sequence. We are told that every successive term is $\\frac{m}{7}$ times the previous term. Thus the second term is $\\frac{m}{7}$ times $x_0$, the third term is $\\frac{m}{7}$ times the second term, which is $\\frac{m}{7} \\times \\frac{m}{7} \\times x_0$, and so on. We can simplify this as $x_0 \\left(\\frac{m}{7}\\right)^k,$ where $k$ is some integer greater than 1. Now we know that this sequence is strictly decreasing. This means that each term is smaller than the previous term. But this only works if the value of $\\frac{m}{7}$ is less than 1. To see this, we use our formula to calculate the first decrement in the sequence: the second term minus the first term. We obtain $x_0(1 - \\frac{m}{7}) < 0$, or equivalently $\\frac{m}{7} > 1$. If $\\frac{m}{7}$ is less than 1, every term in the sequence is positive, so the terms do not decrease at all.\nOn the other hand, if $\\frac{m}{7} = 1$, we have a constant sequence of $x_0$s.\nThus we know that $m > 7$. We also know that if we divided every term in the sequence by $m$, we would get a sequence with the first term $\\frac{x_0}{m}$ and subsequent terms being $x_0\\frac{1}{m}^k,$ where $k$ is the term. This sequence would no longer be strictly decreasing if any of its terms increased, but the only time a term could increase is if $\\frac{1}{m}$ is greater than 1. Thus we must have $\\frac{1}{m} > 1$ or $m < 1$.\n$m < 1$ tells us that $m$ must be a positive integer less than $7$.

The third term is $\\frac{m}{7}$ times the second term. In general, the $n^\\text{th}$ term in the sequence is $\\frac{m}{7}$ times the $(n-1)^\\text{th}$ term, which is equal to $\\left(\\frac{m}{7}\\right)^{n-1}$ times the first term.\nThe first term is some positive number, $a$. Each successive term gets smaller and smaller. Therefore, the smallest possible $n^\\text{th}$ term, when $m=n-1$, is $\\left(\\frac{m}{7}\\right)^{n-1}$ times the first term, which is $a\\left(\\frac{m-1}{7}\\right)^{n-1}$.\nThis expression is minimized when $n-1$ is as large as possible, which is when $n=7$. At this point, the expression $a\\left(\\frac{m-1}{7}\\right)^{n-1}$ becomes $a\\left(\\frac{m-1}{7}\\right)^{6}$, and this is equal to some positive number when $m-1=\\frac{7\\cdot r^{2/3}}{\\ln a}$, where $r$ is the real number such that $e^{r^{2/3}}=a$.\nThis equation will have $0$, $1$, or $2$ solutions for $m$, depending on whether $a$ is between $e^{1}$, $e^{e^{1}}$, and $e^{e^{e^{1}}}$.
