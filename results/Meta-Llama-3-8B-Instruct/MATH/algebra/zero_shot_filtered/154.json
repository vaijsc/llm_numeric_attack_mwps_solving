        "To find the value of \\(\\frac{z}{y}\\) given that \\(\\frac{x}{y}= 2\\) and \\(\\frac{z}{x}= 4\\), we will manipulate these equations step by step.\n1.

        " $\\frac{x}{y}= 2$ and $\\frac{z}{x}= 4$\nNow, recall $(\\frac{a}{b})(\\frac{c}{d}) = \\frac{ac}{bd}$ .  Let\u2019s replace a, b, c and d with our variables.\nIn the problem, we can rewrite $(\\frac{x}{y})(\\frac{z}{x}) = \\frac{x}{y}\\times \\frac{z}{x}$\nThen, we get $\\frac{x}{y}\\times \\frac{z}{x} = \\frac{x\\times z}{x\\times y} = \\frac{z}{y}$\nSo, let\u2019s do the multiplication. $\\frac{x}{y}\\times \\frac{z}{x} = \\frac{x\\times z}{x\\times y} = \\frac{x\\times 4 \\times x}{x\\times y} = \\frac{4x^2}{xy} = \\frac{4x}{y}$\nSince $x$ and $y$ cancel out, we get $\\frac{x\\times z}{x\\times y} = \\frac{4x}{y} = \\frac{4}{1} \\times \\frac{x}{y} = 4(2) = 8$\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{8}$ .\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 8.
