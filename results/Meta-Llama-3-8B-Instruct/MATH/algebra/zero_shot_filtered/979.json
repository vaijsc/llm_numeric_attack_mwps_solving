        " First we set up equations. If we let Lenny\u2019s amount be L , then we have that Larry\u2019s amount is \\frac{2}{5}L.

Therefore, our answer is correct. Final Answer: The final answer is 15. I hope it is correct. The problem is from Number Systems (Patterns and Relationships). The problem involves Ratios. We have to set up a system of equations to solve this problem. We set up a system of equations as follows:\nL + 2/5L = 35\nL = x\nWe may now solve for x.

We can say that the ratio of Lenny's amount to Larry's amount is 5:2 because it is given that Larry has two-fifths of Lenny's amount. 2. We can also say that if Lenny's amount is 20, then Larry's amount is 8. That is because 2/5 * 20 = 8. 3. We can also say that Lenny's amount is 10 more than Larry's amount. That is because if we take the ratio 5:2, we get that if",
        " First, let's think about the two-fifths relationship between Larry and Lenny. Let Lenny have 5x dollars. Larry would have two-fifths of Lenny\u2019s amount, so he would have \\begin{align*} \\frac{2}{5}(5x)&=2x \\end{align*} so Larry has 2x dollars.

I hope it is correct.  ###### Neither of the two ways calculate correctly. If Larry has two-fifths of Lenny's amount, let Lenny have $x$ dollars, then Larry will have $2x/5$ dollars. Now, adding both amounts together, you will get the total amount of $35. So, $x + 2x/5 = 35$. To solve this, we can first combine like terms. Then we multiply both sides by $5$ to eliminate the fraction. We get $5x + 2x",

        " Let\u2019s say Lenny has $$L dollars. Then Larry will have L\\times\\frac{2}{5}=0.4L$  dollars. Their total amount is 35. Hence, we set up the equation: L+(0.4L)=35\nRearranging and solving the equation algebraically, we see that L=50 and 0.4L=20. Now, let\u2019s calculate how much more than Larry Lenny has: 50-20=\\boxed{30} So Lenny has$30 more than Larry.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 30. I hope it is correct. ### Solution 2: Another way to solve this is to assume that Lenny has L  dollars. This means Larry has 2/5 of Lenny\u2019s amount, which means Larry has L \\times 2/5 = 0.4L dollars. Altogether they have 35 dollars. So, if we say L = 10, the total amount will be 10 + 0.4 \u00d7 10 = 12. This is less than 35, so 10 must be too small to solve the problem. Let L = 20. If we add 2/5 times 20 with 20, we have 20 + 0.4 \u00d7 20 = 20 + 8 = 28. This is less than 35, so 20 is too small. If we say L = 30, we have 30 + 0.4 \u00d7 30 = 30 + 12 = 42. This is too large since the total is 35. So, let L = 40. We have 40 + 0.4 \u00d7 40 = 40 + 16 = 56. But we know that the total amount is 35, so L = 50. By the same logic we used in the first solution, if L = 50, 0.4L = 20, and so Lenny has 30 more than Larry. Final Answer: The final answer is 30. I hope it is correct. I hope it is correct.

        " The most straightforward approach to answer this problem, is to start with Lenny\u2019s amount and then subtract Larry\u2019s amount from it.\nLet \\$$l be Lenny\u2019s amount. Larry has \\$$\\frac{2}{5}l of Lenny\u2019s amount, so Larry has $\\$$\\frac{2}{5}l. Since together they have$\\$$35, we must have that\n$$l+\\frac{2}{5}l=35.$$or$$\\frac{7}{5}l=35.$$$Therefore,$l=\\frac{5}{7}\\cdot35=25. Finally, Lenny has 25 dollars and Larry has$\\frac{2}{5}\\cdot25=\\$10, so Lenny has $\\boxed{\\$15}$more than Larry. Final Answer: The final answer is 15. I hope it is correct. #### Reasoning One method to solve this problem is working backwards. This way can be used to make it easier to understand and remember. From this method, it can be seen that if Lenny has$c$dollars, Larry will have$\\frac{2}{5}c$dollars. We can use this information to set up an equation. The sum of their money is$35, so we can set up the following equation:$$c+\\frac{2}{5}c=35.$$Combine the terms on the left side of the equation. You can distribute the\\frac{7}{5}onthedollar sign, giving you 7c/5 on the left side of the equation. 7c/5 = 35 You can now multiply both sides of the equation by 5,yielding the following equation: 7c = 175. To find c, take 175 and divide it by 7, giving you 25. Once you know c is 25, it\u2019s straightforward to find Larry\u2019s amount of money. Since they have 2/5 of Lenny\u2019s money, Larry\u2019s amount is $\\frac{2}{5}c=\\frac{2}{5}\\cdot 25=\\$10.\nLenny has $\\$25$and Larry has$\\$10$, so Lenny has $\\boxed{\\$15}$morethan Larry. Final Answer: The final answer is 15. I hope it is correct. #### Comment By the way, it\u2019s also easy to solve this problem with a systems of equations approach. If you want, I can show you how that works.",
        "$$Let Lenny have$ x\\$ and Larry have $\\$2x/5$. Then we are given that\n$x + 2x/5 = 35$. Multiplying by 5 we have \\begin{align*} 5x+2x &= 175\\\\ 7x&=175\\\\ x&=25\\\\ \\end{align*} So Lenny has$25$and Larry has$\\$10$. Therefore, Lenny has $\\boxed{\\$$15}$ more than Larry.posted by Lali_majnun ### Footer: Powered by Yacas We use cookies to personalize content and ads, and to analyze our traffic.
