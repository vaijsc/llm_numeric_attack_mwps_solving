        " For this problem, it seems that some students may be struggling to understand how to determine that point on the graph of $y=f(x)$. What we need to do is to figure out what is the composition of two functions: $y=\\frac{1}{4}f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}x\\right)$, which is the new function, and $f(x)$, which is the original function.\nWe know that there exists a point in the second coordinate plane that satisfies $y=\\frac{1}{4}f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}x\\right)$ to be $(8,8)$. This means that $\\frac{1}{4}f(16)=8$. If we want to find the point on the graph of $y=f(x)$, then we can reverse the composition process. (We change $\\frac{1}{4}f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}x\\right)$ to $f(x)$ and also find $x$ that satisfies it.)\nHow do we do that? Well, we can set up a new equation involving $f(x)$. We need to find a relationship between $\\frac{1}{2}x$ and $f(x)$ that would give us the new equation. Since we have already converted $\\frac{1}{2}x$ into 16, so we have $64$ that we want to keep track of. (Common mistake: students often forget to write down the transformations we did!) Then we can set up $x_2=f(64)$.\nThe point $(16,8)$ is on the graph of $y=f(x)$.",
        " Since $(8, 8)$ is on the graph of $y = \\frac14f\\left(\\frac12x\\right)$, we have $\\frac12\\cdot 8$ in the equation instead of $x$. So, $\\frac14f(4)=8$.\n### Hence f(4)=32\nNow, we can find out $f(8)$. $f(8)=2\\cdot\\frac14f(4)=16$. Finally, the point (8,16) must be on the graph of $y=f(x)$. So, the sum of coordinates of that point is 8+16=24.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 24. I hope it is correct.  [1]10.  [4]F(4) = 32.  [5]Therefore f(4) = F(8) = 32.

        " Since the point (8,8) lies on the curve $y=\\frac14f\\left(\\frac12x\\right)$, which is given by $$y=\\frac14f\\left(\\frac12x\\right)=\\frac14f\\left(\\frac{8}2\\right)=\\frac14f(4)=2,$$ thus $f(8)=16$.\nIn the same way, solving for $y$ on the equation $y=f(x)$, which becomes $$y=f(x)=f\\left(2\\cdot8\\right)=f(16)=16,$$ we can say that $(16,16)$ must be on the curve $y=f(x)$. Hence, the sum of coordinates we are looking for is $16+16=\\boxed{32}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 32. I hope it is correct.   ### Please post the correct step-by-step solution. I hope it is helpful for me.   ### If there are any mistakes, please correct me.   Started with $y = \\dfrac 14f\\left(\\dfrac 12x\\right)$ and the point $(8,8)$ lies on it. But we have another variable, so we should do another operation.\nFirst, $\\bf{x}$ goes to $\\bf{\\frac{1}{2}x}$, then $\\bf{y}$ goes to $\\bf{\\frac{1}{4}}$.\nAnd since $(8,8)$ lies on this, we have $\\bf{\\frac{1}{4}f\\left(\\dfrac{8}{2}\\right)=8\\implies f(4)=32}$.\nNow we need to turn it back.\nFirst, $\\bf{\\frac{1}{4}}$ goes to $\\bf{1}$, then $\\bf{\\frac{4}{2}}$ goes to $\\bf{2}$.\nSo, we have $\\bf{y=f\\left(\\dfrac{2\\cdot 8}{2}\\right)=f(16)=16}$.\nSo, we have our answer, $\\bf{(16,16)}$.",
        "  The first step: We are given that the point $(8,8)$ is on the graph of $y=\\frac 14f\\left(\\frac 12x\\right)$.  That means $\\frac 14f\\left(\\frac 12(8)\\right)=\\frac 14f(4)=8$, which gives $f(4)=32$.  That means $f(8)=\\boxed{64}$.\n Final Answer: The final answer is 64. I hope it is correct. \nFinal Answer: The final answer is 64. I hope it is correct. \n#### Thinkwell Solutions\nThe point $(8,8)$ is on the graph of $y=\\frac14f\\left(\\frac12x\\right)$.  That means $\\frac14f\\left(\\frac12(8)\\right)=\\frac14f(4)=8$, which gives $f(4)=32$.  That means $f(8)=\\boxed{64}$.",
        " First, how would we use the given point to find $f(x)$ in terms of $x$?\nThe easiest way to approach this question is to realize that\n$$y=\\frac 14f\\left(\\frac 12x\\right),$$and let\u2019s plug in $x=16$, $y=8$ and solve for $f(x)$.\nWe get that $$8=\\frac14f\\left(\\frac 12\\cdot 16\\right)=\\frac14f(8)=2f(4),$$or $f(4)=16$.\nThis looks nice! Now, the way I solve it is that since $f(4)=16$, we can plug this back into $y=\\frac 14f\\left(\\frac 12x\\right)$ to obtain \\begin{align*}\ny&=\\frac14f\\left(\\frac12x\\right)\\\\\n&=\\frac14\\cdot\\left(f(4\\cdot\\frac12)\\right)\\\\\n&=\\frac14(16)\\\\\n&=\\boxed{4}.\n\\end{align*}So the point that must be on the graph of $y=f(x)$ is $(8,4)$, which gives us an answer of $\\boxed{12}$.\nAnswer: The final answer is 12.
