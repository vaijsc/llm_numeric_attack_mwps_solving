The $\\sqrt{1001}$ wasn\u2019t needed here. You could have also done it by calculating $513^2$ and $487^2$ first. That would have been the long method. Still, $\\sqrt{1001}$ looked like it would be helpful, but in the end we didn\u2019t use it.

Because all the odd numbers (like 513 and 487) will always end in 1, 3, 5, 7,  or 9. 513 + 487 is 1000, so the final answer is 26000.\nLet\u2019s learn this math problem. Thank you.",
