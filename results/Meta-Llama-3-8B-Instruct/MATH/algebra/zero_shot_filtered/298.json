        " Let\u2019s think step by step.\nWe are given that $f(x)=g(g(x))-g(x)$. Since we are asked to find $f(3)$, we substitute $x=3$ into $f(x)$ to get\n$$f(3)=g(g(3))-g(3)=g(5)-g(3).$$To evaluate the right-hand side, we need to compute $g(5)$ and $g(3)$.\nRecall that $g(x)=2x-1$.\nFor $g(5)$, we plug $x=5$ into $g(x)$ to obtain\n$$g(5)=2(5)-1=9.$$Similarly, for $g(3)$, we plug $x=3$ into $g(x)$ to obtain\n$$g(3)=2(3)-1=5.$$\nNow we can plug back into $f(3)$:\n$$f(3)=g(5)-g(3)=9-5=\\boxed{4}.$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 4.

        " Well let\u2019s start with the equation $f(x) = g(g(x)) - g(x).$ Substituting $g(x) = 2x - 1$ in this equation we have\n\\begin{align*} f(x)&=g(g(x))-g(x)\\\\\n&=\\left[2(g(x))-1\\right]-g(x) \\\\\n& = 2(2x-1)-1 - (2x-1) \\\\\n&=4x-2-2x+1 \\\\\n&=\\boxed{2x+1}. \\end{align*} Now that we have our equation for $f(x),$ we can easily find $f(3)$ by plugging in $x=3.$ Therefore, $$f(3) = 2(3)+1 = 6 + 1 = \\boxed{7}.$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 7.

        " So, we use the definition of $f(x)$ with the information about $g(x)$.\n#### f(x) = g(g(x)) - g(x)\nSubstitute $g(x) = 2x-1$ into $f(x)$.\n#### f(x) = g(2x-1) - g(x)\nNow you can plug in the given value for $f(3)$.\n#### f(3) = g(2*3-1) - g(3)\n#### f(3) = g(6) - g(3)\n### Ready? Fill in the answer.\n#### f(3) = g(6) - g(3)\n#### f(3) = (2*6-1) - (2*3-1)\n#### f(3) = 11 - 5 = 6\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 6. I hope it is correct. 80% confidence level\nSo, $f(3) = 6.$",

        " If $f(x)=g(g(x))-g(x)$\nLet $y=g(x)=2x-1$\nSo $f(x)=g(g(x))-g(x)=g(2x-1)-(2x-1)$\nAnd we know $g(2x-1)=2(2x-1)-1=4x-3$\nSo $f(x)=4x-3-(2x-1)=2x+3-1=\\boxed{2x+2}$\nBy this way, we get $f(3)=2\\cdot3+2=8$\nAnswer: $\\boxed{8}$\nWe can tell that $f(x)$ is a quadratic function with leading coefficient $2$ and it passes the point $(0,2)$, since when $x=0$, $g(x)=g(0)=-1$ and $(g(g(0))=g(-1)=1)$, so $f(0)=g(1)-(-1)=1-(-1)=2$. Note: In the graph we can tell that the vertex of the parabola $f(x)$ is $(1,2)$. As $f(x)=4x-3-(2x-1)$\n$=2x+2$ then the vertex is the point where $x=-\\frac{b}{2a}=-\\frac{2}{2}=1$, which is correct hence, $f(3)=2x+2$ at $x=3$\n$=2 \\times 3+2=8$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 8.
