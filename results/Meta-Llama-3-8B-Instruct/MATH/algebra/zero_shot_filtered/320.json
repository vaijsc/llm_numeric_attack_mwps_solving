        "To solve the inequality \\( |x - 2| \\leq 5.6 \\), we start by interpreting the absolute value inequality.

We will break it down into two parts:\n1. **From the left side:** \n   \\[\n   -5.6 \\leq x - 2\n   \\]\n   Adding \\( 2 \\) to both sides gives:\n   \\[\n   -5.6 + 2 \\leq x\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this, we have:\n   \\[\n   -3.6 \\leq x\n   \\]\n2. **From the right side:**\n   \\[\n   x - 2 \\leq 5.6\n   \\]\n   Again, we add \\( 2 \\) to both sides:\n   \\[\n   x \\leq 5.6 + 2\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   x \\leq 7.6\n   \\]\nCombining both parts, we have the final compound inequality:\n\\[\n-3.6 \\leq x \\leq 7.6\n\\]\nNext, we need to determine the integers within this range.

        " 11\nHere\u2019s what we need to do. Write the inequality in terms of x, then solve to get a set of numbers in terms of x. Finally, count the number of integers.\nThe absolute value in the equation tells us that x \u2013 2 can be positive or negative. With positive x \u2013 2 it\u2019s x \u2013 2 \u2264 5.6, and with negative x \u2013 2 it\u2019s -(x \u2013 2) \u2264 5.6. Simplify both equations to:\nx-2 \u2264 5.6\nx \u2264 7.6\n-(x-2) \u2264 5.6\nx \u2265 -3.6\nCombine the two solutions to get -3.6 \u2264 x \u2264 7.6.\nIf we pick integers within that range, we get -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.\nSo there are 11 integers.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 11.

        " \nFrom the problem, we can figure out that the range of $x$-value in the solution is between 2 - 5.6 and 2 + 5.6. Which means, the $x$-value will be between 2 - 7.6 and 2 + 7.6.\nSo, the solution will be $x$-value between 2 - 7.6 and 2 + 7.6, which is $-4.6 \u2264 x \u2264 9.6$.\nFor example, in the range of x from 2 to 9.6 and the range of x from -4.6 to 2.

        " The expression is only positive when $x-2\\ge0$, so we have to find the numbers $x$ that satisfy $$x-2\\le5.6\\Rightarrow x\\le5.6+2=7.6.$$On the other hand, the expression $|x-2|\\le5.6$ can also be written as $$-5.6\\le x-2\\le5.6\\Rightarrow2.6\\ge x\\ge-3.6.$$Therefore, the solution set is $[-3.6,7.6]$, and there are $\\boxed{11}$ integers in the set.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 11.

        " \nThe solution set of the given inequality |x-2|\u22645.6 consists of real numbers between -3.6 and 7.6, inclusive. Within this range, all the integers can be manipulated using the following logic: for any integer x on the given range, it can be written as |x-2|= |x - integer part of x| + |integer part of x - 2|.\nThe integer |integer part of x-2| equals 0 since integer part of x-2 is either 0 or \u00b11. Hence |x-2| = |integer part of x - 2|, which makes 0 \u2264 |x-2| = |integer part of x - 2| \u2264 1.\nNow let us count the integers on the given range:\nFor the range from -3.6 to -3, inclusive: We get |integer part of x - 2| = |integer part of x| + |integer part of (-x + 2)|, which is always either |integer part of (-x + 2)| or |integer part of x|.\nThese are x-3, x, (x+1), (-3). Since |integer part of (-x + 1)| = |integer part of (-x)| = |(-3)| = 3, there are 4 integers.\nFor the range from -2 to 3, exclusive: |integer part of x - 2| = |integer part of x| + |integer part of (x - 2)| equals either |integer part of (-x+2)|, |integer part of (-x)|, |integer part of x|, or |integer part of (x)|. These are (x - 2), x-1, x, (x+1), (-2), (-1), 2.\nWe can see that -2, 1, and 2 can be manipulated into integers less than or equal to |x-2| = 3 as well. Hence there are 7 integers.\nFor the range from 4 to 7.6, inclusive: |integer part of x-2| = |integer part of x| + |integer part of (x - 2)| equals either |integer part of x|, |integer part of (x-2)|, |integer part of (-x+2)|, or |integer part of (-x)|.

        " 11  Let\u2019s see for $$|x-2|\\leq5.6$$\nIf we take out the absolute value, we have $$-5.6 \\leq x-2 \\leq 5.6$$ Add 2 to all parts to get $$-3.6 \\leq x \\leq 7.6$$ Then we can drop the absolute value.\nNow, let\u2019s list the integers separately: $$-3,$$ $$-2$$ $$-1,$$ $$0,$$ $$1,$$ $$2,$$ $$3,$$ $$4,$$ $$5,$$ $$6,$$ $$7.$$\nNow, check every number with the answer inequalities, and the number will be there in the solution if it satisfies them.\n$$(1) -3.6 \\leq -3 \\leq 7.6 \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\  True$$ $$(2) -3.6 \\leq -2 \\leq 7.6 \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ True$$ $$(3) -3.6 \\leq -1 \\leq 7.6 \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ True$$ $$(4) -3.6 \\leq 0 \\leq 7.6 \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ True$$ $$(5) -3.6 \\leq 1 \\leq 7.6 \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ True$$ $$(6) -3.6 \\leq 2 \\leq 7.6 \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ True$$ $$(7) -3.6 \\leq 3 \\leq 7.6 \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ True$$ $$(8) -3.6 \\leq 4 \\leq 7.6 \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ True$$ $$(9) -3.6 \\leq 5 \\leq 7.6 \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ True$$ $$(10) -3.6 \\leq 6 \\leq 7.6 \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ True$$ $$(11) -3.6 \\leq 7 \\leq 7.6 \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ True$$ So the integers in the solution set are $$-3,$$ $$-2,$$ $$-1,$$ $$0,$$ $$1,$$",
