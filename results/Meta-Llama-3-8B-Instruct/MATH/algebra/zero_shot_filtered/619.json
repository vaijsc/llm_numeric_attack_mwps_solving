        " \nThe distance between $(1,2)$ and $(-4,-10)$ is equal to the distance $d$ between $(1,2)$ and $(-1,-2)$ plus the distance between $(-1,-2)$ and $(-4,-10)$. This is a common technique in solving distance problems, called the \"3-point method.\" Because distance is a positive value, its absolute value is taken in calculations. \nThen we can solve the problem using the 3-point method. The distance between $(1,2)$ and $(-1,-2)$ is\n\\begin{align*} d_{1}&=\\sqrt{(1-(-1))^2+(2-(-2))^2}\\\\ &=\\sqrt{2^2+4^2}\\\\ &=\\sqrt{20}\\\\ &=2\\sqrt{5}. \\end{align*}The distance between $(-1,-2)$ and $(-4,-10)$ is\n\\begin{align*} d_{2}&=\\sqrt{(-1-(-4))^2+(-2-(-10))^2}\\\\ &=\\sqrt{3^2+8^2}\\\\ &=\\sqrt{9+64}\\\\ &=\\sqrt{73}. \\end{align*}Therefore, the total distance is \\begin{align*} d&=d_{1}+d_{2}\\\\ &=2\\sqrt{5}+\\sqrt{73}. \\end{align*}In the final answer, remember to round the decimal value to the appropriate number of decimal places, as specified by the problem.
