        " First, let\u2019s start by solving for $m$ and $n$ separately and restricting ourselves to positive integers.\n\\begin{align*}\nmn=7&\\implies m=7/n,\\\\\nm+n=8&\\implies 7/n+n=8\\\\\n&\\implies n=8-7/n\\\\\n&\\implies n=8/n-7\\\\\n&\\implies n^2=8n-7\\\\\n&\\implies n^2-8n+7=0\n\\end{align*}This can be factored as $(n-7)(n-1)=0$, which means $n=7,1$\u201d.\u201dTaking $n=1$ as extraneous makes $m=7$, but we need positive integers. Taking $n=7$ makes $m=1$, which is also fine since we have $n,m>0$. We thus obtain the solution set $\\boxed{\\{1,7\\}}$.\n### Solution\nIn problems involving equations in two variables, it is very tempting to Graph the two equations on the same coordinate system, intersect them, and estimate the values. Not this problem. When the constraint is of type $xy=c$, the graphs are hyperbolas that go up on one side and down on the other. These curves are rarely intuitive to understand, and can ofttimes lead to incorrect estimates.\nThe secret here is to combine the equations, $mn=7$ and $m+n=8$, by subtracting $m+n=8$ from $m+n=2\\cdot(mn)=2\\cdot 7=14$ to obtain $mn-2(mn)=7-14$, which we can simplify to $-(m+n)=-7$. This becomes $n=-m-7$, and hence $(m,n)=(-1,7)$ or $(m,n)=(7,1)$, both of which return $m-n=6$.\n### Why does there seem to be no comment from most professionals on this question? Did they have a similar experience and immediately conclude that the obvious answer has no insecurities, or did they not have the forethought to note that Equation (1) has more constraints, and they \u201cknow\u201d that any two variables can\u2019t be independent given two equations?\nIt is known that problems like this can have only linear constraints, yet the present problem has a nonlinear constraint. This fact should signal to them to check the mono-",

Substitute $7m$ for $mn$ and $n=7/m$ to get $m^2=m(7/m)-7/m$. Multiply both sides of $m^2=(m)(7/m)-7/m$ by $8$ to get $8m^2=7m-7m$. Take advantage of the canceling like terms to get $8m^2=0$.\n### Simplification: $m=0$ raises an issue, so $m^2=0$ has no solution. Each non-zero $m$ value gives an equivalent $n$ value, and only the sum can be used.\n$$m=8-n$$This gives $$n=8-m$$.

Let's Input $\\frac{7}{n}$ and 8 - $n$ in the equation and solve the equation then you will have $m$- $n$ = $Z`.\n### Nicolaou: I believe the answer is 4. If we add the two equations together, we get $mn$ + $m$ + $n$ = 15. Simply replacing $mn$ and $m$ + $n$ gives 7 + 8 = 15, which is correct. We know that either $m$ or $n$ must be positive because they are equal to 7. If we let $m$ = 7, then $n$ = 1. If we let $n$ = 7, then $m$ = 1. In either case, $|m$ - $n|$ = 6.\n### Instan:I believe you are correct too. we can calculate $m$ + $n$ = 8 to get $n$ = 8 - $m$. Plugging this into the original equation $mn$ = 7 and solving for $m$ gives us $m^2$ - 8$+$ 7 = 0. Either factor the equation or use the quadratic formula to find $m$, giving us two possible solutions: $m$ = 1, $n$ = 7. $m$ = 7, $n$ = 1. Therefore, |$m$ - $n$| = |1 - 7| = | - $6| =",

Therefore, we have four cases of $(m, n) = (7, 1), (1, 7), (6, 2), (2, 6)$. Depending on which case, we can compute $|m-n|$.\n$$(m, n) = (7, 1) \\Rightarrow |m-n| = |7-1| = 6$$\n$$(m, n) = (1, 7) \\Rightarrow |m-n| = |1-7| = 6$$\n$$(m, n) = (6, 2) \\Rightarrow |m-n| = |6-2| = 4$$\n$$(m, n) = (2, 6) \\Rightarrow |m-n| = |2-6| = 4$$\nIn conclusion, $|m-n|$ is the largest when $m = 7$ or $n = 7$, which both yields $|m-n| = \\boxed{6}$.

        " \nThe solution to this problem is $5$.\nStep 1: We are given that $mn = 7$. Therefore, if we want to find $|m-n|$, we must find $m$ and $n$ first.\nStep 2: We are also given that $m + n = 8$. Remember, we are given that $mn = 7$. Let\u2019s write two equations as follow: $m + n = 8$ and $mn = 7$.\nStep 3: If we multiply the equation $m + n = 8$ by $n$, we get the equation $mn + n = 8n$. We know that $mn = 7$, so we can substitute this into the equation. Thus, we get $7 + n = 8n$.\nStep 4: We can solve for $n$ by subtracting $7$ and then multiplying by $-1$, which gives us $-n = 1$. This means that $n = -1$.\nStep 5: Now we have $n = -1$, so we can find $m$ by substituting this value into $m + n = 8$. We get $m + (-1) = 8$, which gives us $m = 9$.\nStep 6: We have found $m = 9$ and $n = -1$, so now we can find $|m-n|$. The absolute value of a number gives us its distance from zero. Therefore, we must add $m$ and $n$ and then take the absolute value. The absolute value of $m + n$ is given as $|m + n| = |-1 + 9| = |8| = 8$.\nStep 7: $|m-n|$ is the same as subtracting $n$ from $m$, so we must subtract $-1$ from $9$, which gives us $|m-n| = 9 - (-1) = 10$. The absolute value of $10$ is $10$, so $|m-n| = 10$.\nStep 8: However, we need to find the distance from $m$ to $n$, not the distance from $n$ to $m$. Therefore, when we subtract $n$ from $m$, we should subtract $9$ from $-1$. This gives us $|m - n| = |-1 - 9|",
