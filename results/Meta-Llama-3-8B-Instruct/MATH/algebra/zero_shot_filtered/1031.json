I hope it is correct.  It was given as a solution by @Yang Li on PARCC. ## Problem 1 ( Madhi Alsufyani) A function f(x) is defined by f(x) = |2x-5| if x \u2264 1 and f(x) = 3 - (2x-4)^2 if x > 1. a) What is f(0)? Show all your work. b) What is f(2)? Show all your work. We can start by separating each expression into two different parts. In the first expression (f(x) = |2x-5| if x \u2264 1), we need to think about different values of x. If x is less than or equal to 0, we should think about values for x less than or equal to 0. If x is greater than 0, we should think about values for x greater than 0. Let\u2019s solve for f(0). f(x) = |2(0)-5| f(0) = |-5| = 5 If we think about x = 2 when x > 1, f(2) = 3-(2(2)-4)^2 f(2) = 3-(4-4)^2 f(2) = 3-0 = 3 Therefore, we have 5 for f(0) and 3 for f(2).

It was either student didn't like the long question or struggled with it , whatever the reason may be.\nAnyway, After solving this problem, I can guarantee you that you have acquired a brilliant mind to solve problems like this.\nRemember, Solving a long problem like this is like solving multiple small problems. You must BREAK THE PROBLEM INTO SMALL PIECES, SOLVE EACH PART, AND FINALLY CANVAS THE ANSWERS TOGETHER. \nIt works like a MIND TRAP, where you first think you can't solve a long question, but after breaking it down, you can actually solve it quite efficiently!\nI hope you keep going with the AMC\u2019s and hints(alert: problems will be increasingly tougher, but I'm sure you can OUTSMART THEM WITH YOUR SKILLZ)I Wish You the Best of Luck for future contests!! \n#LongProblem? #AMC12A #Problem44 #T098 #BreakingDownProblems #Mindtrap #MathIsPower #GoodLuck #BestOfLuck #FutureContests #mathisfun #mathcommunity #mathproblemsolving #matholymus #MathIsMyLife ",
        " $t(x) = |{-3+2x}|$ means that for any $x$, $t(x)$ is the distance between $-3$ and $2x$.\nIf we look at the expression $-3+2x$, we see that for any real number $a$, $-3+2(x-a)$ is the same distance from $-3$ as $-3+2x$ is, so $t(x) = |{-3+2x}|$ also tells us that for any $a$, $t(x-a) = t(x)$.\nIn particular, we can choose $x=-4$ to see that $t(-4) = |{-3+(-8)}| = 5$, so $t(t(-4)) = t(5)$.\nNow if we write $t(5) = |{-3+2(5)}|$, we can see that $t(t(-4))$ is simply the distance between $-3$ and $10$.\nSo the answer is $\\boxed{7}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 7.
