One we might not think too much about at first, since $3 \\ast Q$ suggests multiplication, and we can see that $P$ and $Q$ represent numbers.

First, we need to evaluate the expression inside the parentheses, which is $6 \\ast 8$. We know that $6 \\ast 8$ represents $\\frac{6+8}{2} = 7.0$, but since we can\u2019t have a fraction of a whole number, we can round that to $7$. So, $6 \\ast 8$ equals $7$.\nNow, we\u2019re left with $3 \\ast 7$.

Each language has its unique way of communication and may convey different messages. This is called the \"channel-material-code\" system, where each has its own function.\nThe \"channel\" refers to the medium by which the message is conveyed. For example, a written note could be an example of a channel. The \"material\" refers to the substance or medium that carries the message. For example, the words and letters of a written note are the material. The \"code\" refers to the specific set of rules and conventions that are used to convey the message. For example, the grammar and spelling rules of a written note are the code.\nIn a language, the \"channel\" and \"material\" are usually closely linked. For example, if we are talking about written language, the channel and material are the same: the words, letters, and paragraphs on the page. However, in some cases, the",

        " 9\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 9. I hope it is correct. I use the following way. (P \\ast Q) is the average of P and Q, then 3 \\ast Q is (3+Q)/2, and (6\\ast8) is the average of 6 and 8, which is 7. Then 3\\ast(6\\ast8)=3\\ast7=(3+7)/2=5. So my answer is 5, but it\u2019s wrong. By \u201ctradition\u201d, we have (6\\ast8)=14/2=7. Then 3\\ast(6\\ast8)=3\\ast7=(3+7)/2=5. So my answer is 5, but it\u2019s wrong. By \u201ctradition\u201d, we have (6\\ast8)=14/2=7, and 3\\ast7=(3+7)/2=5 (wrong). After I realized that, I try again. Let M=(P+Q)/2, then M=(P+P)/2 since Q=8, then M=P. Let N=6\\ast8, then N=(6+8)/2. Then N=(14)/2=7. Then 3\\ast N=3\\ast(7). Now, using the same \u201ctradition\u201d, we have 3\\ast N=3\\ast7=(3+7)/2=10/2=5, and finally I get 5 again. Here we can try to use another way. We should have a \u201cmeaning\u201d of (P \\ast Q). Then the \u201cmeaning\u201d is average of P and Q. When we say average of P and Q, we mean that it is (P+Q)/2. Then we have a new answer. Since (6\\ast8)=14/2=7, we have 3\\ast7=(3+7)/2=5. The final answer is 5. Let\u2019s use the average to see that. We first have (6\\ast8)=(6+8)/2=14/2=7. Then 3\\ast(7)=(3+7)/2=5. Final Answer: The final answer is 5. I hope it is correct. I hope it is correct.

To evaluate 3*(6*8), we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):\n1. Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: 6*8 = 48\n2. Evaluate P*Q, where P = 48 and Q = ?, so P*Q = (48+/+)/2 = ? (since we don't know Q)\n3. Evaluate 3*?: 3*(48+/+) = ? (since we don't know the value of ?)\nTo find the value of 3*(6*8), we need to evaluate (48+/+)/2 and then multiply by 3. However, we don't know the value of ? (or Q) since we don't have enough information to determine it.\nTherefore, we can't provide a straightforward answer for 3*(6*8) without additional information about Q.\nP.S.
