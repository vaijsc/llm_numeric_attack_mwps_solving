Next, simplify the expression inside the square root sign (\u221a) and combine the terms when possible. Finally, calculate the square root of the simplified expression. This way, you can correctly find the value of $h(-1)$, which is $h(-1) = \u221a\\frac{-1+3}{2} =\u221a\\frac{2}{2} = 1$ . Remember to perform the operations inside the square root sign (\u221a) before simplifying the expression. In this case, there are no terms that can be combined, so we proceed directly to find the square root of the simplified expression (\u222bfrac{2}{2} = 1). Given this step-by-step approach, you should be able to master the process of finding the square root of an expression and thus successfully calculate the value of $h(-1)$ as 1. Focus on simplifying the expression inside the square root sign (\u221a) and calculating the square root of the simplified expression. This will guide you in correctly finding the value of $h(-1)$. In the case of $h(-1)$, the correct answer is $1$ , which shows you can adequately follow the step-by-step method. So, it is crucial to keep the square root sign (\u221a) with both terms, simplify the expression inside the square root sign (\u221a), and calculate the square root of the simplified expression when finding the value of $h(-1)$ . It is crucial to memorize the steps when solving square root problems, which are: \u221a, simplify, and \u221a. When finding the square root of an expression, keep the square root sign (\u221a) with both terms, simplify the expression, and then calculate the square root of the simplified expression. This will help you correctly solve any square root problem. By following the steps carefully, you can find the square root of the expression $\\frac{-1+3}{2}$ , which is $h(-1",
        " Start\nWe are given the function $h(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{x+3}{2}}$.\n### ",
        " \n##### We will define the square root function carefully before applying it to the expression in the question. It is known that the square root function is defined for any number $y$ such that $\\sqrt{y}$ = $x$ if and only if $y = x^2$ and $x \\geq 0.$\nIf we note this definition carefully, we then get that if $h(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{x+3}{2}},$ then $h(x) = y$ if and only if $\\frac{x+3}{2} = y^2$ and $y \\geq 0$. It now follows that $h(-1)$ = $y$ if and only if $\\frac{-1+3}{2} = y^2$ and $y \\geq 0$. We know that $\\frac{-1+3}{2} = 1$ and the number $1$ is a perfect square since $1^2 = 1.$ Now if we check the two conditions for $h$ to equal $y$ then the first condition is satisfied, that is, $\\frac{-1+3}{2} = y^2$  because $y^2 = 1$.  Now the second condition will be satisfied as well, that is, $y \\geq 0$, since $y = 1 \\geq 0.$ Therefore, we must have $h(-1) = 1$.\n#### Applications of the square root function:\n1.  Many mathematical and real-world applications have the use of the square root function, which helps us solve various problems related to geometry, algebra, physics, engineering, and so on. For instance, the distance formula in coordinate geometry involves the square root function.\n2.  The square root function helps us find the length of an unknown side of a triangle by using the Pythagorean theorem. It has many practical applications such as calculating distances, heights, and angles in surveying, architecture, physics, and engineering.\n3.  It is used in finance and economics to calculate returns and growth rates.\n4.  The square root function plays a significant role in probability theory, on the one hand, and cryptography, on the other.\n5.  In computer graphics, it is used to draw shapes and perspectives and carry out various visual tasks.\n6.  In statistics, the square root function helps calculate standard deviations, confidence intervals, and many other statistics that help make predictions and forecast events",

We first simplified the fraction and then used the square root operation to find the result, which is $h(-1) = \\boxed{1}$.

The water exits the tank through a hole at the bottom of the tank with a cross-sectional area of $0.1\\pi$ square meters. The water flows out at a constant rate. If the water level is currently at a height of $2$ meters, at what rate is the water level falling in meters per second? \nLet $h$ be the height of the water in the tank in meters. The cross-sectional area of the water at this height is $\\pi\\left(\\sqrt{10^2-(h-4)^2}\\right)$. Since this is equal to the cross-sectional area of the exit hole, $0.1\\pi$ square meters, we can set up an equation:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\pi\\left(\\sqrt{10^2-(h-4)^2}\\right)&=0.1\\pi\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad\\sqrt{10^2-(h-4)^2}&=0.1\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 100-(h-4)^2&=0.01\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad(h-4)^2&=99.99\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad h-4&=\\pm\\sqrt{99.99}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad h&=4\\pm\\sqrt{99.99}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad h&=4\\pm11.255\n\\end{align*}We note that the height of the water cannot exceed the height of the tank, so the only valid height is $h=\\boxed{4+11.255=15.255}$ meters.\nTo find the rate at which the water level is falling, we set up an equation with constant rate of change, $k$, so that $dh/dt=-k$, where $h$ is the height of the water and"
