    "solution": "The only way that 5 can be expressed as the product of two positive integers is as $5 = 1 \\times 5$.  Therefore, the first and third terms are 1 and 5, in some order.  Since all the terms in the sequence are positive integers, the common difference must be nonnegative, so the first term is 1, and the third term is 5.\n\nThen the second term is the average of the first term (namely 1) and the third term (namely 5), or $(1 + 5)/2 = 3$.  Therefore, the common difference is $3 - 1 = 2$, and the fourth term is $5 + 2 = \\boxed{7}$.",

We can write the following:\na 1 * a 3 = 5\nSince they are positive integers, we know that a 1 is a positive integer and a 3 is a positive integer such that their product is 5. The only prime factors are 2 and 5. By inspection, we find that 5 is the smallest prime factorization of 5. Hence, a 1 is either 1, 2, 5, or 1 and 5.

        " We can write the arithmetic sequence $a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d$, where $a_1$ is the first term and $d$ is the common difference. We are told that the first and third terms multiply to 5, so $a_1 \\cdot (a_1 + 2d) = 5$, or $a_1^2 + 2da_1 - 5 = 0$. Factoring, we get $(a_1 + 5)(a_1 - 1) = 0$. Therefore, $a_1 = 1$ or $a_1 = -5$.

Now, we want to factor $a^2+2ad$ as $(a+d)(?)$.\n### Answer: But we can see that $a+d=\\sqrt{2ad+5}$, but squaring the factor $(a+d)$ gives us $(a+d)^2=a^2+2ad+d^2$.\nThus, $a^2+2ad+d^2=2ad+5$, and subtracting $2ad$ from both sides gives us $d^2=5$. This means $d=\\pm1$, $d=\\pm5$ (the last two cases being impossible as they make $a$ and $d$ negative). But if $d=1$, the equation becomes $a^2+2a=5$ and the factors of it is $(a+1)(a+5)$, but $a$ must be positive and so $a+5\\lt16$ which gives $a\\lt11$, so $a=4$ and $d=1$, but if $a=4$ and $d=1$, then the fourth term is $4+3=7$, so the answer is $\\boxed{7}$. Please correct me if I did anything wrong. Edit: It seems the question mentioned it\u2019s a positive integer sequence, so the correct solution should be $a=1$ instead of $a=4$. $a=1$ and $d=1$ makes $a^2+2ad=5$ satisfying.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2.

Since $d\\cdot a$ is positive, $d$ and $a$ have the same sign.  Therefore, we can assume $d>0$.  Otherwise, if $d<0$, the equation $a^2+2ad-d^2=0$ would imply $a$ is negative, whereas $d$ would be positive, so that the product $a^2+2ad-d^2=da+d(a-d)$ would be negative.  We can thus assume $d$ is a positive integer and try to find positive integer values of $d$ that satisfy the equation $$a^2+2ad-d^2=0.$$Using trial and error, we find that $a=1$ and $d=2$ satisfy this equation.
