This condition is caused by an abnormal fertilization of the egg and can lead to an empty pregnancy without the development of a fetus.\nLoss of pregnancy as early as 6 weeks is common during the first trimester, and it is often due to a miscarriage. Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) and amniocentesis tests can carry a small risk of miscarriage, and bleeding during the first trimester can also indicate a miscarriage. Stress, lack of proper nutrition, and other health problems can also increase the risk of a miscarriage during the first trimester.\nHere are a few more reasons why miscarriage is common during the first trimester:\n1. Embryonic developmental problems: These problems can occur in the fertilized egg due to genetic issues or environmental factors, leading to a miscarriage. Genetic problems can cause malformations, while environmental factors like toxins, radiation, and infections can also affect the development of the embryo.\n2. Chromosomal abnormalities: Many miscarriages occur due to chromosomal abnormalities, which can make the embryo incapable of developing properly.\n3.
