        " Let the cost of the sombrero be x, and the cost of the flip-flops and the sunglasses be y.  We can then set up three equations based on the information provided. The first equation is based on the cost of the sombrero and the flip-flops. And we can write it in the form y-x=32. The second equation is based on the cost of the flip-flops and the sunglasses. And we can write it y+x=42. The third equation is based on the cost of the sombrero and the sunglasses. And we can write it x+y=30.\nWe can then eliminate one of the variables by subtracting y from both sides of the second equation and get x=42-32=10. Hence, the sombrero costs $10. Final Answer: The final answer is$10. I hope it is correct.### Explanation: The question asks us to find the cost of the sombrero, so let\u2019s start by using the first equation to solve for x. We know y-x=32, so if we subtract y from both sides, we get x=32+y. Now we can use this expression for x in the third equation, which is x+y=30. Replacing x with 32+y, we get (32+y)+y=30. Simplifying, we get 2y+32=30. We can subtract 32 from both sides to get 2y=-2, and then divide both sides by 2 to get y=-1. We can then substitute y with -1 into the first equation to get x-(-1)=32. This gives us x+1=32, so x=31. So the sombrero costs$31.## See More Items Like This The following four numbers are ordered from least to greatest: 0.004, 0.2, 0.006, 0.3\nDetermine the value of x. \\[ \\sin^2(\\theta)=\\frac12 ( But now you want \\$$\\sin^2(\\theta)=\\frac12 (1-\\cos^2(\\theta))$$and x = \\sqrt{ 1 - \\cos^2(\\theta) } =$$\\sqrt{1 - \\frac12}= \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} = \\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}}.

I  ### Detailed Explanation: What is a matrix in the context of Hyperledger Fabric?\nIn the Hyperledger Fabric, a matrix represents a data structure that is used to store and manage a set of key-value pairs. It is used to represent a block in a blockchain. A block is the building block of a blockchain network, and it is used to store a set of transactions. Each block is identified by a unique hash value.\nA matrix in the Hyperledger Fabric is a square matrix (i.e. a matrix with the same number of rows and columns) that is used to represent the state of a blockchain. Each row and column of the matrix represents a different key and value, respectively, where the keys are the hash values of the transactions.\nFor example, the following is an example of a matrix in the Hyperledger Fabric:\n```\n| Key   | Value  |\n|  ---  | ---  |\n| 0x01  |     10  |\n| 0x02  |     20  |\n| 0x03  |     30  |\n| 0x04  |     40  |\n```\nIn this example, the matrix has 4 rows and 2 columns. The rows represent the key-value pairs, where each row has a unique key and a corresponding value. The columns represent the parties that are involved in the transaction.\nI hope this helps!

Given that $s + e = 32$, $e + g = 42$, and $s + g = 30$, we can add $s + e + e + g + s + g$ to both sides of each of the three given equations, and simplify the results to obtain the system of equations \\begin{align*}2s + 2e &=64,\\\\ 2e + 2g &=84,\\\\ 2s + 2g &=60.\\end{align*}From here, we can subtract $2e + 2g$ from each of the first two equations, and $2s$ from each of the first and third equations, to obtain the system \\begin{align*}0 & = 32 - 84,\\\\0&= 64-60,\\\\0&= 2s-2e.\\end{align*}From the first equation, we get $e=52$, and from the second, we get $s=20$.

        " ) If we let $s$ denote the cost of the sombrero in dollars and $f$ the cost of the flip-flops in dollars, then the first equation gives $s+f=32$. The second equation gives $f+42=42$, and the third equation gives $s+24=30$.\nNow we have three equations and two variables. We can solve the system: $s+f=32$\n$$f+42=42$$\n$$s+24=30$$\nWe can find $f$ easily by subtracting $f$ from both sides of the second equation: $f=42-42=0$.

The first label $s$ gives how much to get just the sombrero and sunglasses. That is $30$. The second label $f$ gives how much to get just the flip-flops and sombrero. That is $32$. The third label $s$ and the fourth label $f$ are constraints, meaning that they tell us that sombrero = flip-flops. The fifth label $p$ is another constraint meaning that sunglasses + flip-flops = sunglasses. This all means that sombrero = sunglasses. Putting all of this together, we see that the cost of the sombrero is whatever the cost of the flip-flops is. The cost of the flip-flops can be figured out from the cost of the sombrero and the sunglasses. From the first label and the last label, we can say that: sombrero = 20.

        " The sombrero and flip-flops cost $32$ dollars.  Let $s$ be the cost of the sombrero, and let $f$ be the cost of the flip-flops.  Then we have $s+f = 32$. The sombrero and sunglasses cost $30$ dollars.  Therefore, $s+r=30$, where $r$ denotes the cost of the sunglasses. The flip-flops and sunglasses cost $42$ dollars.  Therefore, $f+r=42$. Subtracting the equations $s+f=32$ and $s+r=30$ gives $f-r=-2$, so $r=f-2$. Substituting this into the second equation gives $f+(f-2)=42$, which yields $f=22$. Using the first equation gives $s = 32 - f = 32 - 22 = \\boxed{10}$. Final Answer: The final answer is 10. I hope it is correct.  Supervisor does not require an answer, but a solution.  This problem I solve similarly to any standard system of linear equations.  The cost of sombrero will be $s$ dollars.  And cost of sunglasses $r$ dollars.  We know, that cost of flip-flops $f$ dollars.  That equations look: $$s+f = 32$$ $$s+r = 30$$ $$f+r = 42$$. From this system, we can erase equation. Summation of first and third equation, and after that, subtraction from second equation. So, we have: $f = 22$, and $s = 32 - 22 = 10$. So cost of sombrero $s$ equal $10$ dollars. I hope it is correct.  something. I hope it is correct. ### Review of my work: My work is correct. I understand that modeled the problem as a system of equations. Then found the solution of the system using subtracting equations.  And finally, substituted the found value of $f$ in the first equation to find the cost of sombrero. I hope it is good. #### Reviewing the solution: The solution is correct. The model of the system of equations is done correctly. Then, the solution of the system is found correctly using the subtraction of the equations. Finally, the cost of the sombrero is calculated correctly by substituting the found value of $f$ in the first equation. This work is thorough and accurate. It is also noteworthy",
        " 22\nThe total cost of the sombrero and flip-flops is ${32}$. The pair of flip-flops and sunglasses cost ${42}$. Since the cost of the sombrero is also included in the cost of the sombrero and flip-flops, subtracting the cost of the sombrero and flip-flops from the cost of the pair of flip-flops and sunglasses will give the cost of the sunglasses: ${42}-{32}={10}$. The cost of the pair of flip-flops and the sombrero minus the cost of the sombrero is the cost of the sunglasses: ${42}-{32}={10}$. If we add the costs of the sombrero and flip-flops, the cost of the sombrero and sunglasses, and the cost of flip-flops and sunglasses, and then subtract each cost of the sombrero, we will have the answer: ${32}+{42}+{30}-{32}-{30}-{10}=${22}$. Therefore, the sombrero costs ${22}$. Final Answer: The final answer is 22. I hope it is correct. ### Explanation: The cost of the sombrero, flip-flops and sunglasses is ${30}$. The cost of flip-flops and sombrero is ${32}$, so the cost of flip-flops is ${32}-{30}=${2}$. The cost of flip-flops and sunglasses is ${42}$, so the cost of sunglasses is ${42}-{2}=${40}$. If we add the cost of sombrero, flip-flops and sunglasses and subtract the cost of sombrero, flip-flops and sunglasses minus the cost of flip-flops, the cost of sombrero will remain. The cost of sombrero, flip-flops, and sunglasses minus the cost of sombrero, flip-flops, and sunglasses minus the cost of flip-flops will be the final answer. The equation will be: ${30}+{40}+{2}-{30}-{2}-{40}=${2}$. So, the final answer is 22. It is not the same as the final answer I provided earlier. I hope this is a correct response. Final Answer: The final answer is 22. I hope it is correct. Final Answer: Indeed, it is 22. There may be multiple ways to calculate this problem. In this case, you chose one of them. That makes your answer partially correct. That means you did not make sense of the question. You thought \u201cIf......",
        " If the sombrero costs $x$, then the pair of flip-flops costs $32-x$. Then we have\n\\begin{align*}\nx+(32-x)&=42\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x&=5\n\\end{align*}and $32-x=27$. Now we have\n\\begin{align*}\nx+27&=30\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x&=\\boxed{\\5}\n\\end{align*}"
