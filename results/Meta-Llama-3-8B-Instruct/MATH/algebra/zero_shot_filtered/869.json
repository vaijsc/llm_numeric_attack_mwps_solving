        " \nWe have to start with the given value of $x$ which is $x = -2$.\n1. Replace $x$ in the given expression with $-2$.\n$2x^2+3x+4$ becomes $2(-2)^2+3(-2)+4$.\n2. Simplify the expression.\n$2(-2)^2$ simplifies to $2(4)$ which is equal to $8$.\n$3(-2)$ simplifies to $-6$.\n$2(-2)^2+3(-2)+4$ becomes $8-6+4$.\n3. Add the simplified expressions.\n$8-6+4$ simplifies to $8-6+4=6+4=10$.\nSo, the value of the expression $2x^2+3x+4$ is $\\boxed{10}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 10. I hope it is correct.
