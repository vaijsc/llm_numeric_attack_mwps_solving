        " By the remainder theorem, the equation $x^2+8x+4$ has no solution for $x=0$. Since we are looking for a single solution, it must have only one solution for any value of $x$. In other words, $2$ must be an important point in this graph.\nIf we put in $x=2$, then we have\n$$\na(2)^2+8(2)+4=4a+20+4=4a+24.\n$$\nSo, ideally we want $4a+24=0$, but the equations we are trying to solve can\u2019t be zero! What if we add $3$ to both sides to get:\n$$\n4a+24+3=3=4a+27.\n$$\nIf we subtract $4a$ from both sides, we get\n$$\n3-4a=27-4a\\Rightarrow3=27.\n$$\nOh dear! This doesn\u2019t work at all! So we must have $3=0$. This doesn\u2019t work at all either. Come back to the problem, what is the equation saying to us?\nIt is saying that we must have\n$$\n4a+20+4=0\\Rightarrow 4a=-24\\Rightarrow a=-6.\n$$\nBut why can\u2019t we just set $a=6$ instead? Well, that would mean that the equation is $6x^2-8x+4$, which does not have a real solution. Thus, we must choose $a=-6$ for our equation and we find that our final answer is $\\boxed{-6}$.\nHowever, we have not solved our original problem. How do we do this?\n$$\nax^2+8x+4=0\\Rightarrow \\frac{-8}{2a}=\\frac{-8}{2a}\\cdot\\frac{1}{4a}=-a\\pm \\sqrt{(a)^2-\\frac{8}{a}}=-a\\pm \\sqrt{(a)^2-\\frac{8}{a}}=0.\n$$\nNotice how there is a discriminant here.

        " \nLet $ax^2+8x+4 = 0$. We can see that the discriminant $b^2-4ac$ is $64-4a\\cdot4$, which is $64-16a$.\nSince $b^2-4ac$ should be equal to 0 when the equation has only one solution, $64-16a=0$. This gives $a=\\boxed{4}$.\nSo, we can make sure that $ax^2+8x+4=0$ has only one solution when $a=4$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 4.

        " A first-grade solution\nFrom my understanding of the problem, you are looking for the value of a so that the equality $ax^2+8x+4=0$ has only one solution.\nWe know that for a quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ to have only one solution, the discriminant must be equal to 0.

Substituting these values in the equation $b^2-4ac=0$ gives us $8^2-4a*4=0$\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by $1$ and simplifying gives us $64-16a=0$\nAdding $16a$ to both sides of the equation gives us $64=16a$\nDividing both sides of the equation by $16$ gives us $4=a$",

        " We want a quadratic equation $$ax^2+8x+4=0$$ that has only one solution. If an equation in the form $ax^2+bx+c=0$ has only one solution, then there is exactly one $x$ for which $ax^2+bx+c=0$. In other words, there may be $x$ for which $$ax^2+bx+c\\ne0,$$ but for only $x$ among all the $x$\u2019s, $$ax^2+bx+c=0.$$ So, we want to guarantee that there is only one such $x$. That is, we want $ax^2+8x+4=0$ to be linearly dependent on $x$.\n### Case analysis:\n(1) $a\\ne0$: In this case, $ax^2+8x+4=0$ is a non-linear equation. So, it may have exactly one solution when $a\\ne0$.\n(2) $a=0$: In this case, $ax^2+8x+4=0$ is a linear equation with slope $-8$ and $y$-intercept $4$. So, it may have several solutions.\nSo, (2) $a=0$ does not guarantee a single solution. But, (1) $a\\ne0$ may guarantee a single solution. So, we want $$ax^2+8x+4=0\\quad\\text{to have a single solution for }a\\ne0.$$ Then, $ax^2+8x+4=0$ has only one solution when $a$ is [non-zero.](https://www.yqtbqs.com/pl0qpf/a-not-zero.html).\n### Solution:\nWe will have a single solution when the equation $ax^2+8x+4=0$ is linear, i.e., when its discriminant is zero. The discriminant is $b^2-4ac$, where $b=8$ and $ac=4a$. So, we want $b^2-4ac=0$. That is, $8^2-4ac=0$, which is equivalent to $ac=\\frac{64}{4}=16$. Since $a\\ne0$, we can think of $c$ in terms of $a$. That is, $ac=16$, which is equivalent to $4a=16$. So",

        " Well, for starters, we should try to find the discriminant of this quadratic equation, which is the term under the radical sign. We know that the discriminant is equal to $b^2-4ac$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the coefficients of the quadratic equation. In this case, we have $a= a$, $b = 8$, and $c=4$. So, the discriminant is $b^2-4ac = 8^2-4( a) (4) = 64 - 16a$. Since we want the quadratic equation to have only one solution, we know that the discriminant must be equal to $0$. Therefore, we must solve for $a$:\n\\begin{align*}\nb^2-4ac&=0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad 64-16a&=0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad 16a&=64\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad \\qquad a&=\\boxed{\\frac{64}{16}=4}.\n\\end{align*}\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\frac{64}{16}=4.
