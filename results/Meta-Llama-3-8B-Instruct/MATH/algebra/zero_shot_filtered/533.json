        " What is $\\left\\lceil{\\frac32}\\right\\rceil$ in fraction and decimal form?\n$\\left\\lceil{\\frac32}\\right\\rceil$ is 2, since 2 is the smallest integer greater than or equal to $\\frac32$. In fraction form, it is $\\frac{3}{2}$.\n### ",
        " $\\left\\lceil{\\frac32}\\right\\rceil=2$ and $\\left(2\\right)^2=4$, so $\\left\\lceil{\\frac32}\\right\\rceil^2=4$. Similarly, $\\frac32=\\sqrt{\\frac94}$, so $\\left(\\frac32\\right)^2=\\frac94$. Since 3 is the first integer that is larger than 3, it follows that $\\left\\lceil{\\left(\\frac32\\right)^2}\\right\\rceil=3$. Therefore, $\\boxed{\\left\\lceil{\\frac32}\\right\\rceil^2+\\left\\lceil{\\left(\\frac32\\right)^2}\\right\\rceil=4+3=7}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 7. I hope it is correct. ### Step-by-step Explanation:\nLet\u2019s break down the problem step by step:\n1. Evaluate $\\left\\lceil{\\frac32}\\right\\rceil$:\nThe notation $\\left\\lceil x \\right\\rceil$ means the ceiling function of $x$, which is the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to $x$. In this case, $\\frac32$ is between $1$ and $2$, so the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to $\\frac32$ is $2$, so $\\left\\lceil{\\frac32}\\right\\rceil = 2$.\n2. Evaluate $\\left(\\frac32\\right)^2$:\n$\\frac32 = \\sqrt{\\frac94}$, so $(\\frac32)^2 = \\frac94$.\n3. Evaluate $\\left\\lceil{\\left(\\frac32\\right)^2}\\right\\rceil$:\nSince 3 is the first integer that is greater than $\\frac94$, it follows that $\\left\\lceil{\\left(\\frac32\\right)^2}\\right\\rceil = \\boxed{3}$.\n4. Return to the original expression:\n$\\left\\lceil{\\frac32}\\right\\rceil^2+\\left\\lceil{\\left(\\frac32\\right)^2}\\right\\rceil = 4 + 3 = \\boxed{7}$.\nTherefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{7}$. Note that there is no need to simplify the expression further, since the original problem only asked for the result of the evaluation. If you want to more clearly understand what the expression suggests, or find additional ways to solve a similar problem, extra work might be",
