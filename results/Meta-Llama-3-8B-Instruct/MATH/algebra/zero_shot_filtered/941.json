        " \nStep 1. Find the square root of 20, which is $\\sqrt{20}=2\\sqrt{5}$. Note that $\\lceil2\\sqrt{5}\\rceil$ should round up 2\\sqrt{5} to the nearest integer, which is $\\lceil2\\sqrt{5}\\rceil = 4$.\nStep 2. Evaluate $\\lceil{\\sqrt{20}}\\rceil^2=4^2=\\boxed{16}$. \nFinal Answer: The final answer is 16. I hope it is correct. \nThe above solution may have used an incorrect or inapplicable mathematical technique. An alternative solution is shown below.\nLet $N = \\lceil{\\sqrt{20}}\\rceil$ and denote $n = \\sqrt{20}$. Since $n$ is exactly equal to $N$ when rounded up, we have $n \\leq N$. We also have that $n^2$ is an integer and is strictly less than 20. Therefore, $4^2 = 16$ is the smallest integer greater than $n^2$, so $N^2 = 16$.\nIf instead $N$ did not round up 2\\sqrt{5}, the following steps would instead be used:\nWe have N \\geq 2 \\sqrt{5}, since if we only round down to 2, the exact square root of 20 (2\\sqrt{5}) becomes less than N. We also have N^2 \\geq 4 \\cdot 5 = 20. Since N is an integer, it must be at least 4 for N^2 to be at least 20. However, in this case we already know that N = 4, which we discovered in the first part of this answer. Therefore, N^2 should not be at least",
        " 36.\nRecall that $20$ can be expressed as $20=4^2+4.$ Then, $20$ is in the interval $(16,25].$ We know that the function $f(x)=x^2$ is increasing and continuous on the interval $[4,5].$ Therefore, \\begin{align*}\nf(x)&=f(5)=25,&&x=5.\n\\end{align*} Since $f$ is increasing in $[4,5],$ then $f(x)$ must have been increasing since $x=4.$ Thus, $5$ is critical and $25$ is the maximum value of $f$ on $[4,5].$ Then, $\\lceil{\\sqrt{20}}\\rceil^2=\\boxed{36}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 36.

        " Let\u2019s start by finding $\\sqrt{20}$. Note that $4^2=16<20$ and $5^2=25>20$, so $\\sqrt{20}$ is between $4$ and $5$. In other words, $\\sqrt{20} \\in (4,5)$. Because of this, the ceiling of $\\sqrt{20}$ is $5$, so we have $\\lceil \\sqrt{20} \\rceil = 5$. Squaring both sides of the equation $\\lceil \\sqrt{20} \\rceil = 5$ yields\n$$\\lceil \\sqrt{20} \\rceil^2 = 5^2 = 25.$$\n### Final Answer: The final answer is 25. I hope it is correct.",

        " $\\boxed{25}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 25. I hope it is correct. Because $\\lceil{\\sqrt{20}}\\rceil=5$, and $5^2=25$. I used the mathematical notation $\\lceil{x}\\rceil$ for the ceiling function, which means the smallest integer not less than $x$. Thus, $\\lceil{\\sqrt{20}}\\rceil$ equals the smallest integer not less than $\\sqrt{20}$. This integer is $5$, because $4^2=16<20$, while $5^2=25>20$. So, $\\lceil{\\sqrt{20}}\\rceil=5$, and $\\lceil{\\sqrt{20}}\\rceil^2=5^2=\\boxed{25}$.
