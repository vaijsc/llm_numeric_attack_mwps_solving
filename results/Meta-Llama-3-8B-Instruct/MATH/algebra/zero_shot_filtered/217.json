        " Let\u2019s think step by step.\nWhen we raise $2$ to the power of $3$, we are essentially multiplying $2$ by itself $3$ times, and getting $8$.\nSo, $(2^3)^4$ is like multiplying $8$ by itself $4$ times, which is equal to $8\\cdot8\\cdot8\\cdot8 = 4096$.\nTo make it simpler, we\u2019ll divide both sides of the equation by $2^{n-6}$, to get $2^6 = 2^{n-6}$. We will then look at the exponents $6$ and $n-6$. Notice that after we divide both sides by $2^{n-6}$, we need to subtract $6$ from $n$ to get $6$.\nAlso, note that division is the opposite operation of multiplication, and the opposite operation of exponentiation is logarithm, so when we do $(2^n) / (2^{n-6})$, we could take the logarithm of both the top and the bottom, and subtract $6$ to get $n - 6$ as our new exponent of the $2$.\nNow, $n - 6$ and $6$ are equal, so $n = 12$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 12.

        " Since $$(2^3)^4 = 2^{3\\cdot 4} = 2^{12}$$ and $$(2^3)^4 = 2^n$$ , we should say that $2^{12} = 2^n$ . It means that $$12 = n$$ . So, for what value of $n$ is $(2^3)^4 = 2^n$? The answer is 12.\n### Note: \u00a0Alternatively, \u00a0we could notice that when a base is raised to a power, it extends the number of times it is multiplied. So for example, $2^{12} = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2$ . Also when the same base is multiplied together n times, we could also express it as $2^n$ . \u00a0So in our case, \u00a0$2^{12} = 2^n$ . Therefore, $n$ = 12.
