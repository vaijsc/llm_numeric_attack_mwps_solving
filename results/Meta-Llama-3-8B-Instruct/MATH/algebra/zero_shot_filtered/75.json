The $x$-value halfway between $-1$ and $5$ is $x=2$.  Therefore the vertex of the parabola is equal to $(2,k)$ for some $k$ and the parabola may also be written as  \\[a(x-2)^2+k.\\] Now we substitute.  The point $(5,0)$ gives  \\[0=a(5-2)^2+k,\\] or  \\[9a+k=0.\\] The point $(0,5)$ gives  \\[5=a(0-2)^2+k\\] or  \\[4a+k=5.\\] Subtracting the second equation from the first gives  \\[(9a+k)-(4a+k)=0-5\\] so $5a=-5$, giving $a=-1$.\n\nSince $a=-1$ and $9a+k=0$ we know that $k=9$ and our parabola is  \\[ax^2+bx+c=-(x-2)^2+9.\\] In order to compute $100a+10b+c$ we can substitute $x=10$ and that gives  \\[100a+10b+c=-(10-2)^2+9=\\boxed{-55}.\\]",

        " First, we draw a graph of the parabola and locate the given points:\nAs we can see, the parabola is symmetric about the vertical line $x=2.5$.  Therefore, the parabola will have two roots (where the parabola is $x$-intercept) at $x=-1$ and $x=5$.  Since the parabola contains the point $(0,5)$, the parabola must have a $y$-intercept at $(0,5)$, so that $c=5$.  We recall that the roots of a parabola are the solutions of the equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$, so we set $x^2+b x+5=0$.  We recall that an equation of the form $x^2+px+q=0$ with roots $r_1$ and $r_2$ can be solved recursively by the formula $x=\\frac{-p\\pm\\sqrt{p^2-4q}}{2}$.  So, we can rewrite the quadratic in the form $$x^2+bx+5=x^2+\\left(-\\frac{\\sqrt{b^2-100}}{2}+b\\right)x+5,$$which gives us that the $x$-intercepts of the parabola is \\begin{align*}\nx&=\\frac{-\\left(-\\frac{\\sqrt{b^2-100}}{2}+b\\right)\\pm\\sqrt{\\left(-\\frac{\\sqrt{b^2-100}}{2}+b\\right)^2-20}}{2}\\\\\n&=2.5.\n\\end{align*} So we have $-1+2.5=5$, which is true.
