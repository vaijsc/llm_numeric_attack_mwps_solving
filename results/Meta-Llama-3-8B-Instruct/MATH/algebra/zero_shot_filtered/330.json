They all appear to be random numbers.  Perhaps some student thought they were cute.\nThough the problem does not state it, it is helpful to know the identity $(a-b)^2=a^2-2ab+b^2$, which reduces the above expression to $4ab+(a-b)^2$. We should not expect to see many 1002s in many math problems, I would say.  So this may just be a random problem that combines the algebraic manipulations.Giving any meaning to these numbers is beyond my pay-grade or, I should say, within my pay-grade but that grade is very low.\nIf you want a moral or a lesson from this, it is keep your algebra in order for these things can be relatively easy.  So, to the interested and mathematically able, your algebra matters and simplifies complex-looking expressions.\nBack to school, I suppose is a good ending for this note.

Yes, problems like that are relevant.

        " $(1002)^2=(1000+2)^2=1000^2+4\\cdot 1000\\cdot 2+2^2=1000000+4000+4$\n$=(1000-2)^2=1000^2-4\\cdot 1000\\cdot 2+2^2=1000000-4000+4=1000000-3996$\n=C$10000^2-(502+298+202)^2+298^2+202^2$\n=$(1000000-3996)+C$ C=\nC$1000^2-(502+298-202)^2+298^2-202^2+C$\n$=1000000-3042+58249+8416-40100+C$\n$=1000000-1207+144665+C=-1267+144665+C$\n$Hence\\boxed{147398}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 147398. I hope it is correct.\n**Solution 1**\nBy difference and identity of squares, we have\n\\begin{align*}\nA &=1002^2-502^2+298^2-202^2\\\\\n&=(1002+502)(1002-502)+(298+202)(298-202)\\\\\n&=1504\\cdot 500+500\\cdot 96\\\\\n&=750000+48000=\\boxed{798000}\n\\end{align*}Notice that in the first step we are doubling a common difference so we need to subtract the first term from the second, but we subtracted and then divided by 2 to get to that equivalence, so we went back the wrong way. It is easier to see what I did in the differential and difference please see the class.\n**Solution 2**\nIt is often very helpful to \"see\" what the question is asking for. The question is really asking us whether or not the table \\begin{align*}\n:&1002^2-502^2+298^2-202^2\\\\\n:&=1002^2-502^2+298^2-202^2\\\\\n:&=(1002+502)(1002-502)+(298+202)(298-202)\\\\\n:&=1504\\cdot 500+500\\cdot 96\\\\\n:&=750000+48000\\\\\n:&=798000\n\\end{align*}",
        " \nWhat do we know?\n1. For $(a+b)^2$, we have $$a^2+2ab+b^2$$\n2. For $(a-b)^2$, we have $$a^2-2ab+b^2$$\nSubtracting  $2ab$ term in 1 and 2, we can write\n$$(a+b)^2-2ab+(a-b)^2=a^2+b^2=(a-b)^2+(a+b)^2$$\nLet\u2019s apply this to $$1002^2-502^2+298^2-202^2$$ $$=(1002^2-502^2)+(298^2-202^2)$$\nDivide each terms into two parts as tuples$$\\begin{matrix}\n(1002+502)^2-(1002-502)^2 & & (298+202)^2-(298-202)^2\\\\\n\\end{matrix}$$\nWe can group each part of each terms as tuples as follows.$$=\\boxed{(1002+502)^2-(1002-502)^2+(298+202)^2-(298-202)^2}$$\nWe know what to to, substitute the the values into the tuples.\n$$(1002+502)^2-(1002-502)^2+(298+202)^2-(298-202)^2$$ $$=(1504)^2-(1004)^2+(500)^2-(396)^2$$ $$=2(1504^2-1004^2+500^2-396^2)$$ Now, it become a sum of squares and we know that $$a^2+b^2=(a+b)^2-2ab$$ So, we have:\n3336^2-624^2+4^2$$ $$=(1504)^2-(1004)^2+2^2$$ $$=1504^2-1004^2+2^2$$ $$=2(1504^2-1004^2)+2^2$$ Finally, we have the result.\n1504+1004=2512, and so, 1504^2-1004^2=2512^2=2512000. $$=2512^2$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2512000. I hope it is correct. charisma495 got it wrong They took the sum of squares instead of the difference.",
        " We know that the difference of squares factorization that $x^2-y^2 = (x+y)(x-y)$. Therefore, we can factor the first two terms $1002^2-502^2= (1002+502)(1002-502)= (1504)(500)=750,800.$ Similarly, for the last two terms $202^2-298^2=(202+298)(202-298)=500(-96)=-47,200.$ Hence, by putting the two pieces together, we have $750,800-47,200=703,600.$ Note that the question asked you not to use calculator. The answer is 703,600.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 703,600. I hope it is correct. \n### "
