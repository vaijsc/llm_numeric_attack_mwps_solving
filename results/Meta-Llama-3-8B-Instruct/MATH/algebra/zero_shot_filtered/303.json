Wachter Dissertation Date: 2011-05-25 by Rebecca A. Wachter\nhttps://www.osti.gov/biblio/1084555\nGold is typically considered inert to most chemicals, but a study involving the oxidation of solid gold with 2,2\u2019-bipyridine (bipy) in the presence of oxygen has been reported. The reaction was investigated using electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and UV-vis spectroscopy. The results show that the reaction is not only chemical but also electrical, involving a transfer of electrons between the gold and bipy. The reaction mechanism involves the formation of a surface-bound intermediate, followed by a rearrangement of the molecules to form the product.\nThe oxidation of gold with bipy has been studied extensively, but the reaction mechanism is not yet fully understood. Many studies have focused on the role of the solvent, temperature, and concentration of the reactants. However, the reaction mechanism for the oxidation of gold with bipy in the presence of oxygen has not been investigated in detail.\nThe study presented in this thesis investigates the chemical changes that occur during the oxidation of solid gold with bipy in the presence of oxygen. The reaction was studied using electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and UV-vis spectroscopy. The results show that the reaction is not only chemical but also electrical, involving a transfer of electrons between the gold and bipy.\nThe reaction mechanism was found to involve the formation of a surface-bound intermediate, followed by a rearr",
