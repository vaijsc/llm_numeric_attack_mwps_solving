        " $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}}$\nLet\u2019s start with the rule of logarithms that says $\\log_b b=1$. Or, when you are taking the logarithm base $b$ of something, it will always be equal to 1.\nSo, in this case, $\\log_266=1$.\nSince $\\log_b b=1$, we know that the logarithm base $b$ of something will always be greater than 0.\nNow, 64 is the square of 8, so $\\log_266\\ge \\log_28$.\nBut $\\log_28=\\frac{1}{3}$.\nThis is true since there will always be an integer that when you raise $b$ to the power of that integer, it will be equal to 8. That integer is 3. The corresponding logarithm is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\nSo, $64=b^5 \\Rightarrow 8=b^{\\frac{5}{2}}\\Rightarrow 2=b^{\\frac{5}{10}}\\Rightarrow b^{\\frac{1}{5}}=2$, so $\\log_266=\\frac{1}{5}$.\nWe can make sure that $\\frac{1}{5}$ is correct by checking it out. For instance, we can think about $4^5=1024$. It\u2019s not equal to 64. $4^2=16$, so when you multiply it by 4, you get 64.\n### Message from the AI: Hello!
