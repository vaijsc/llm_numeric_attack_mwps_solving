Also, $\\boxed{y^3 = 8}. So, $x^2 + y^3 = \\frac{49}{9} + 8 = \\boxed{9}.$\nI hope my solution is correct.

        " First, we find the average of $13$, $-16$, and $6$.\nThe average is the sum divided by the number of times the sum is taken. In this case, it is $$\\frac{13+(-16)+6}{3}=\\frac{3}{3}=1.$$ So $x$ is $1$.\n### ",

        " 2\nx is the average of 13, -16, and 6 means x is the sum of these 3 divided by 3. We can write it as:\n\\frac{13-16+6}{3} = \\frac{3}{3} = 1\nSo x = 1edis\n### ",
        " The first thing we have to be careful about here is that the quantities we are dealing with, namely $x$, $y$ and the numbers $13$, $-16$ and $6$, may not be numbers of the form $a$, where $a$ is a real number.  In other words, we should attempt to simplify each quantity somewhat.\nIf $x$ is the average of $13$, $-16$, and $6$, then we know that $x=\\frac{13+(-16)+6}{3}=-\\frac{3}{3}=-1$, which implies that $x^2=1$.  On the other hand, we have $y=\\sqrt[3]{8}=2$.  Thus, $y^3=8$.  We have now simplified everything enough so we can give a final answer: $$x^2+y^3=1+8=\\boxed{9}.$$\n### Solution: Since $x$ is the average of three numbers $a$, $b$ and $c$, we have \\begin{align*}\nx &= \\frac{a+b+c}{3}\\\\\n&=\\frac{13+-16+6}{3}\\\\\n&=-1.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $x^2 = 1$.\nOn the other hand, we know that $y$ is the cube root of $8$, so we have $$y = \\sqrt[3]{8} = 2.$$Therefore, $y^3 = 8$.\nIt follows that $$x^2+y^3 = 1+8 = \\boxed{9}.$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 9.

        " Step 1: Calculate the average of 13, -16, and 6.\nTake the three numbers, $13, -16, 6$, and find their average, which we denoted as $x$: \\begin{align*} x &= \\frac{13 + (-16) + 6}{3}\\\\ &= \\frac{-17}{3}\\\\ &= - \\frac{17}{3}. \\end{align*}This is our average number.\n### ",
        " We first calculate the average of $13$, $-16$, and $6$: $$\\frac{13-16+6}{3} = \\frac{-13}{3} = -4+\\frac{1}{3}$$So we set $x = -4 + 1/3$. And $$y = \\sqrt[3]{8} = 2,$$for any number satisfying $y^3 = 8$, not only the principal cube root.\nPlugging in these, we have $$\\boxed{x^2 + y^3 = \\left(-4+\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2 + 8 = \\frac{49}{9} + 8 = \\frac{193}{9}}.$$ Final Answer: The final answer is \\frac{193}{9}.
