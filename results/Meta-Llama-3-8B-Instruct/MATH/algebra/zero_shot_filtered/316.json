        " Let\u2019s start first with $\\boxed{16x^2+36x+56}$ .\nWe can write this equation as: $16x^2+36x+56 = (4x+3)^2$.\nSo what does this tell us? It tells us the quadratic of $16x^2+36x+56$ has no dependency on $m$ and $n$. It\u2019s not related to $m$ and $n$. But wait we are assuming the other quadratic $(mx+n)^2$ does, where does the dependency come in?\nLet\u2019s write out $(mx+n)^2$:\n$(mx+n)^2 = (mx+n)(mx+n) = m^2 x^2 + 2mnx + n^2$\nSo what have we got? We have a $x^2$ term and a constant term and an $x$ term, whereas we also have a $x^2$ term and $x$ term and a constant term in the equation $16x^2+36x+56$. So the only way the constant term can differ is if the constant $n^2=56$.\nAnd so we have a constant term $n^2$ which equals $56$ and thus the other constant $n=8$ because $n$ is the square root of $n^2$. Hence we have $(mx+n)^2 = m^2 x^2 + 36x + 64$.\nBut we also know that $16x^2+36x+56 = 16x^2 + 36x + 56 = (4x+3)^2 = m^2 x^2 + 36x + 56$.\nBut we can draw one more conclusion. They both have a constant term of $56$. Hence, the other constant term of $64$ must also be the same as $56$ in the equation $(mx+n)^2$.\nAnd so we have $m^2 x^2 + 36x + 64 = 16x^2+36x+56$ which is only possible by letting $m^2 = 16$ which yields $m = \\pm 4$.\nTherefore, the only possible option is $m = 4$ since $m$ is a positive number. And so $mn = \\boxed{32}$.\nThat\u2019s my solution. Please let me know if you agree. I am happy to answer any questions you have"
