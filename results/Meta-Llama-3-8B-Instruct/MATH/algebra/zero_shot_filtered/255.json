        " In the question it is given that \n$y=\\frac{(x-2)^2-9}{3}$.\n### Step 1: Investigate Quadratic Expression\nLet\u2019s begin by rewriting the given expression. After taking out the $3$ and also factoring the quadratic expression \n$$y=\\frac{(x-2)^2-9}{3}=\\frac{(x-2+3)(x-2-3)}{3}=\\frac{(x-2+3)(x-5)}{3}$$\nWe find $\\left(x-2+3\\right)=x-2+1$. Thus we can rewrite the equation as:\n$$y=\\frac{(x-1)(x-5)}{3}$$\n### Step 2: Find Intersections.\nNow that we have the rewritten expression for $y$, let\u2019s find the two intersections of $y=f(x)$ and the $x$-axis.\nThe point of intersection of the graph with the $x$-axis is where $y = 0$. Therefore, set $y = 0$ in $y = \\frac{(x-1)(x-5)}{3}$ to find when the graph intersects the $x$-axis.\n$$0=\\frac{(x-1)(x-5)}{3}\\\\ \\Rightarrow \\frac{(x-1)(x-5)}{3}=0$$\n### Step 3: For Which Values Does $y=0$?\nWe can now factor out an $x-1$ from both terms in $(x-1)(x-5)$. This gives us:\n$$0=(x-1)(x-5)$$\n### (x-1)(x-5)=0\nThe terms of an expression become equal to $0$ when their corresponding variables are equal to $0$. For example, $(x-1)(0)=0$, only when $x-1=0$. So, our equation also becomes true only when $(x-1)=0$ or $(x-5)=0$.\nThese equations are both $0$ when $x=1$ and when $x=5$. So the $x$-intercepts are at $(1,0)$ and $(5,0)$. The graph looks something like this:\n### Geometric Representation of the Graph\nThe final step of the question is finding the area of that polygon which has vertices $(1,0)$, $(5,0)$",
        " We have:\n$$f(x) = \\frac{(x-2)^2-9}{3} = \\frac{(x-2)^2 - 3^2}{3} = \\frac{(x-2)^2 - 3^2}{3} = \\frac{(x-2+3)(x-2-3)}{3} = \\frac{(x-2+3)(x-5)}{3}.$$\nThus, $$f(x) = \\frac{(x-2+3)(x-5)}{3} = \\frac{x^2 - 5x + 3x - 10}{3} = \\frac{x^2 - 2x - 10}{3} = \\frac{(x-5)(x+2)}{3}.$$\nTherefore, $$y = f(x) = \\frac{(x-5)(x+2)}{3}$$ should be a parabola opening downward centered at $(-2,0)$. The $x$-intercept would be $x_1 = 5$, and the $y$-intercept would be $y_1 = 0$.\nThus, $x$- and $y$-intercepts of the parabola give us two points $(0,0)$ and $(5,0)$.\nHence, the area of the polygon is $$\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot b\\cdot h = \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 5\\cdot (0-0) = 0.$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 0.

        " First, we need to rewrite $f(x)$ into its most simple form.  Then, we can find the vertex of the parabola.\nf(x)=\\frac{(x-2)^2-9}{3}. To simplify, we can subtract 9 from both sides of the equation, so \\begin{align*}\nf(x)&=\\frac{(x-2)^2-9}{3}\\\\\nf(x)&=\\frac{(x-2)^2-9+4}{3}-4/3\\\\\nf(x)&=\\frac{(x-2)^2-5}{3}-4/3\n\\end{align*} Now we can see the vertex of the parabola at the point $(2,-3/3)$.  We need to find the ways to write $f(x)$ as a parabola as follows:\nf(x)=a(x-h)^2+k\nLet\u2019s substitute.  We can substitute $f(x)=a(x-2)^2-1.3333$.\nThe $x$-intercepts are calculated by letting $y=0$, and solving for $x$: \\begin{align*}\n0&=a(x-2)^2-1.3333\\\\\na(x-2)^2&=1.3333\\\\\na(x-2)^2&=(0.1666+1)(x-2)^2\\\\\na(x-2)^2&=(x-2)^2-5/4\\\\\na(x-2)^2&=(x-2)^2-0.6667-1/4\\\\\na(x-2)^2+a/4&=(x-2)^2-1.6667\\\\\na(x-2)^2+a/4&=0\\\\\n(x-2)^2a+1/4a&=0\\\\\n\\end{align*} Therefore, $x=2\\pm\\frac{1}{2a}$.\nTo find the $y$-intercept, we simply plug in $x=0$, which gives us the point$(-2+2)^2a+1/4a+1.3333).$(1/4a+1.3333)$(1/4a+1.3333)$Since the area of the polygon formed by the $x$-intercepts and the $y$-intercept is simply the area under the parabola from the $x",
        " \nLet\u2019s find the equation for the line of symmetry. Because the question asks us to find the area of a polygon, we should be able to draw a vertical line of symmetry. This means that we need to find the equation of the line of symmetry.\nFor now, we can assume that the graph is already graphed.\nThe reflection of any point (x,y) on the curve across the y-axis will have coordinates (-x, y).\u00a0 As a result, the line of symmetry is the line y=0.\nNow, we can sketch the curve and draw a vertical line at y=0.\nSince the line of symmetry is the line y=0, we know that it is vertical. So, the area to the left of y=0 and above y=0 does not include the same points twice. So, the area of the polygon is the area between the line y=0 and the curve.\nThe x-intercepts are at (-5,0) and (1,0). We can break up the area into two sections: the area between the segment forming the x-intercepts and under the curve, and the area above the curve and over y=0.\nTo calculate the first part, use the formula\nA =\\int_a^b f(x) dx= \\int_{-5}^1 \\frac{x^2-10x+17}{3} dx.\nWe can simplify the expression by dividing by 3 and completing the square.\nA =\\frac{1}{3}\\int_{-5}^1 x^2-10x+17 dx = \\frac{1}{3}[\\frac{1}{3}x^3-5x^2+17x]_{-5}^1.\nWhich equals\nA = \\frac{1}{3}[0+\\frac{1}{3}-17-(-\\frac{125}{3}-25+17)] = \\frac{1}{3}(\\frac{1}{3}-50) = -\\frac{49}{3}.\nThe second part will be the area above the curve and over y=0. It is the area of a triangle with base 2 (the width from the x-intercepts) and height 1 (over how high the curve goes above y=0). So the area is 1*2/2 = 1.\nThe total area is the sum of the first part and the second part, -\\frac{49}{3} + 1",

        " I set up the function by $f(x)=\\frac{(x-2)^2-9}{3}$.

The area of each of these rectangles is $14$. The base is from $-2$ to $6$ and the height is $7$. Thus the total area of these $4$ rectangles is $\\boxed{112}.$ The remaining area of this polygon is the area of the right triangle joining $x$ intercepts. Since $x$-intercepts are $-2$ and $6$ and that the $x$-intercept is on the $x$-axis, we can find its base. $x-(-2)=6-(-2)=8$ $x-2=8$ $x=10$ Now, $y$-intercept is $(0,7)$ which is outside of this graph of $y$. We will call it $A$ and $x$ intercept as $B$ with $B=(6,0)$.   When we look at it, we can see that the distance from $A$ to $B$ is $6$.

        " \nLet's find the x and y intercepts of the equation, and then form a polygon by connecting both of them. We don't need derivatives or anything advanced to solve this problem. This is all basic algebra here.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2. I hope it is correct. Soon we're going to apply some shortcuts to find the answer faster. Let\u2019s start from the X-intercept.\nWe have an equation:\n$$y=f(x)=\\frac{(x-2)^2-9}{3}.$$ We want to find the $x$-intercept. The $y$-coordinate of the $x$-intercept is $0$. So let's substitute $y=0$ into the equation:\n$$0=\\frac{(x-2)^2-9}{3}.$$Multiply both sides by $3$:\n$$0=(x-2)^2-9.$$Simplify:\n$$(x-2)^2=9.$$The LHS is a perfect square. Expand the square:\n$$x^2-4x+4=9$$\n**Check**: Rewrite this with the new question mark. $$x^2-4x-5=0$$\nSolve for $x$ using the quadratic formula:\n$$x=\\frac{4\\pm\\sqrt{4+4\\cdot5}}{2}=\\frac{4\\pm\\sqrt{24}}{2}=\\frac{4\\pm2\\sqrt{6}}{2}=2\\pm\\sqrt{6}.$$We get two values for $x$: $2-\\sqrt{6}$ and $2+\\sqrt{6}$. So, the $x$-intercepts are $2-\\sqrt{6}$ and $2+\\sqrt{6}$. We want to find the $y$-intercepts next.\nFor $y$-intercept, we set $x=0$ into the equation:\n\\begin{align*}\ny&=\\frac{(0-2)^2-9}{3}\\\\\n&=\\frac{4-9}{3}\\\\\n&=-\\frac{5}{3}\n\\end{align*}\nThe $y$-intercept is at $(-1,-\\frac{5}{3})$.\nNow that we have the $x$ and $y$-intercepts, we can form the polygon. Starting from the x-intercept on the right, go up to the $y$-intercept",
        " \nFrom the expression, we have that $f(x)$ is a quadratic function with vertex $(2, 0)$.  From the expression, the leading coefficient of $f(x)$ is $\\frac{1}{3}$.  The graph is symmetric about the $x$-axis and the graph cuts the $x$-axis at $x=5$ and $x=-1$.\nThe $y$-intercept is $(0, -3)$.  To create a polygon, we need to connect the points $(-1, 0)$, $(0, -3)$, and $(5, 0)$ to form a closed polygon.  Thus, the area of the polygon is $\\boxed{6}$.\n-----------------",
        " First find the vertical asymptote. The denominator of $f(x)$ cannot be zero. That gives\n\\begin{align*}\n3&\\ne0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad0&\\ne3.\n\\end{align*}\nThus there are no vertical asymptotes. Furthermore, the denominator can never be zero if $x$ is real. Thus\n\\begin{align*}\n0&\\ne\\frac{(x-2)^2-9}{3}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad0&\\ne(x-2)^2-9\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad0&\\ne(x-2)^2-9^{\\frac{1}{2}2}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad0&\\ne(x^2-4x+4)-9\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad0&\\ne x^2-4x+4-9\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad0&\\ne x^2-4x+5\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad0&\\ne (x-5)(x-1)\n\\end{align*}\nWe see that $(x-5)$ is the only nonzero linear factor for the equation $0=(x^2-4x+5)$. Therefore the other root is\n\\begin{align*}\nx-1&=0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x&=1.\n\\end{align*}\nWe have found $(1,0)$ to be a point on the graph where the $y$-intercept is located. To get the $x$-intercept we set\n\\begin{align*}\ny&=0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad\\frac{(x-2)^2-9}{3}&=0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad (x-2)^2-9&=0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad (x-2)^2&=9\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x-2&=\\pm3\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x&=5 \\text{ and } x=1\\\\\n\\end{align*}\nto find $x=5$ or $x=1$ as an $x$-intercept.\nNow we will graph the function on the $xy$-plane:\n#### The plot at right is the graph of the function, and by inspection we can see that the $x$-intercepts are $(1,0)$ and $(5",
        " The area is the sum of the areas of three individual figures.\n#### Part 1: Triangle $A$, the shaded triangle above $x=2$.\nWe know that $f(x)$ is a squared expression with a leading coefficient of $\\frac13$, so we ought to be able to find the vertex. We also know that the parabola opening downwards, and we know the axis of symmetry, which means that we know enough information to find the vertex\u2019s $y$-coordinate. $f(x)$ opens downwards and has a vertex at $(2,\\frac{1}{3})\\Rightarrow f(x)=(x-2)\\left(-\\frac{1}{3}(x-2)-\\frac{1}{3}\\right)=\\frac{(x-2)^2-4}{3}$. The graph of $f(x)$ will be a down-opening parabola opening downwards.\n#### Part 2: Segment $B$, above $x = 4$.\n$x = 4$ makes the parabola $f(x) = 0$, and we know $f(x)$ opens downwards. So, $(x-2)^2 = 9$, and $x = 2 \\pm 3$. Given it lies above $x = 4$, we see that the right endpoint must be $(7,7)$. The left endpoint must be somewhere, but we don\u2019t know it. We\u2019ll get to that in a moment. $x$ coordinates are: 4, and $y$ coordinates are: increment from (7,7) along the line above it.\n#### Part 3: Triangle $C$, the unshaded triangle above $x=2$.\nNow let\u2019s determine the left endpoint of $B$. In $A$, remember that M is the midpoint. We can draw a vertical line from it. Where does it touch the line in $B$? Think point M on $B$! We now have the left-endpoint of $B$. We increment $y$ along the line below to obtain the bottom vertex $C$. There is no upper point, it stays with the line below line Cvise.\n#### Part 4: Summarise, and the area to find:\nBelow is a summary:\nPicture: Plotting down $x$ coordinates: 2,7. $y$ coordinates for plot above $x = 4$ : 10 and 0.

The problem reads:\nLet $f(x)=\\frac{(x-2)^2-9}{3}.$\nThe equation $y=f(x)$ is graphed, and the $x$- and $y$-intercepts of the graph are connected to form a polygon. What is the area of that polygon?\nHere is the solution:\nThe first step is to sketch the graph of the function $y=f(x)$. The graph has $x$-intercepts at $x=-1$ and $x=5$ since $f(-1)=0$ and $f(5)=0$. The $y$-intercept is at $y=-3$ since $f(2)=-3$. \nWe can see that the shaded polygon can be broken down into a triangle and a trapezoid. If we let $A$ be the $x$-intercept at $x=5$, $B$ be the $y$-intercept at $y=-3$, $C$ be the $x$-intercept at $x=-1$, and $D$ be the point \\left( \\frac{-1+5}{2},0 \\right), the area of the shaded polygon can be expressed as \n\\begin{align*}\n[Ay]&=\\frac{1}{2}|\\overrightarrow{AB}||\\overrightarrow{AC}||\\cos{\\theta}|\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 4",
