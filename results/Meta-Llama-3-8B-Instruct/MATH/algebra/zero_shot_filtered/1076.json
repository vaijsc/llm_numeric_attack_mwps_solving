This question is a straightforward problem using the substitution method to solve it. \nTo achieve the problem, the given lines must be combined to form one equation. The lines are combined by substituting y of the first equation to the second equation:\n3x + y = 92\nWe equate y of the first equation to y of the second equation:\ny = 2x - 13\n3x + (2x - 13) = 92\nCombine like terms:\n5x - 13 = 92\nNow, we add 13 to both sides to get:\n5x = 105\nDivide both sides by 5 to get:\nx = 21\nThe problem asks for the value of x at the point of intersection.
