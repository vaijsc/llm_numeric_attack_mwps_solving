Then$$t_J$$be the amount of time Josh rode. We have$$\\text{distance Mike rode}=\\text{distance Josh rode}\\Rightarrow\\frac{1}{2}rt_M=\\frac{4}{5}r\\cdot2t_M\\Rightarrow5t_M=4t_J\\Rightarrow \\frac{t_J}{t_M}=\\frac{5}{4}.$$Also we are told that$$t_J=2t_M\\Rightarrow \\frac{t_J}{t_M}=2.$$We equate this to$$\\frac{5}{4}$$so that$$\\frac{5}{4}=2\\Rightarrow\\frac{t_M}{t_J}=\\frac{2}{5}.$$Therefore, we have Jr=Mr\\cdot t_M$. Setting this equal to$$13$$, we have$$jr=2mgr\\Rightarrow jr=4Jr\\Rightarrow jr=13\\Rightarrow r=\\frac{13}{J}$$, and hence$$t_M=\\frac{13}{J}r=\\frac{13}{J}\\cdot \\frac{13}{J}=\\frac{169}{J^2}$$and$$t_J=2t_M=\\frac{2\\cdot 169}{J^2}=\\frac{338}{J^2}$$We need to know how far Mike rode when the two of them met.

You can benefit from my response by putting it in the following simpler form: the idea of the problem is to set up equations using the information given in the problem and then solve them.

        " Suppose mike rides at a constant rate $r$ miles per hour.  Then after time $t$ in hours, he will have ridden $rt$ miles.  Josh rides at a constant rate $\\frac{4}{5}r$ miles per hour, and will have ridden $\\frac{4}{5}rt$ miles in $t$ hours.\nTo make the problem easier, suppose Mike has ridden for 1 hour before he meets Josh.  Then, he has ridden $r$ miles.  Josh has been riding for 2 hours, and has ridden $2\\cdot \\frac{4}{5}r= \\frac{8}{5}r$ miles.  When they meet, the total distance travelled is the sum of the distances travelled by each individual.  If they are riding towards each other, these distances from each individual are subtracted, not added.  This gives\n$$r-\\frac{8}{5}r=13\\qquad \\Rightarrow \\qquad \\frac{3}{5}r=13\\qquad \\Rightarrow \\qquad r=\\frac{13\\cdot 5}{3}= \\frac{65}{3}$$Therefore, after 1 hour of riding, Mike will have ridden $\\frac{65}{3}$ miles before they meet.  Note: Another way to think about this problem is that since they're meeting, then they're essentially, in a mathematical sense, heading towards each other, so we're considering the relative motion of them. Josh covered 4/5r * 2 hours or 8/5r distance. Mike covered r * 1 hour or r distance. Thus, when they meet, the total distance they have traveled should be 13, i.e., the distance between them. So, we have 8/5r - r = 13, solving for r, we get r = 65/3.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 65/3.

        " 4\nYou think step by step! Let's analyze the problem. Let the time Mike rode be t. Let the rate Mike rode be r ( distance/rate).  Since Josh rode at 4/5 the rate of Mike, his rate will be (4/5)r. We know that Michael rode t time. So he traveled (rt) distance. Joshua travelled twice the time so he travelled 2t time. Since he is travelling at 4/5r rate, he travelled (4/5)rt = 8rt/5 distance. Since they met each other halfway to either house, they each travelled 13/2 = 6.5 miles. Josh rode (8rt/5) miles, and Mike rode rt miles.\nTherefore 8rt/5 + rt = 6.5.  9t/5 = 6.5, t = 6/3 = 2.\nTherefore Mike rode 2 time which is 2 * r = distance. Distance = r * 2 = 13/2 = 6.5 miles.\nThe correct answer is 4. \nBest regards,\nJeff",
        " \nLet $M$ be the rate of Mike, in miles per hour. \nThen Josh\u2019s rate is $\\frac{4}{5}\\cdot M$ miles per hour. \nSince Josh has ridden for twice the length of time as Mike when they meet, Josh has ridden the length of distance $2M\\cdot\\frac{4}{5}\\cdot t$ and Mike has ridden the distance $Mt$ where $t$ is the time.\nThe distance ridden by Josh plus the distance ridden by Mike equals the total distance between them, namely $13$. \n$2M\\cdot\\frac{4}{5}\\cdot t + Mt=13$\n$(6M+5M)t=13\\cdot5$\n$11Mt=65$\n$\\Rightarrow t=65/11$\nWhen they meet, Mike has ridden for $t=65/11$ hours and has travelled a distance of $Mt=(65/11)\\cdot M=65M/11$ miles.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 65M/11 miles. I hope it is correct.  ### Solution Option 1: We can represent Josh\u2019s distance travelled by $d_1$ and Mike\u2019s distance travelled by $d_2$. We can use little more language to describe Josh\u2019s distance travelled: Josh travels $2M \\cdot \\frac{4}{5}$ more distance than Mike; thus, $d_1 = 2M \\cdot \\frac{4}{5}t$. On the other hand, Mike travels distance $Mt$; thus, $d_2 = Mt$. We also know these distances are in total equal to $13$; so, $d_1 + d_2 = 13$. Now, substituting $d_1$ and $d_2$ into the equation, we can find $t$: $d_1 + d_2 = 13$ $2M \\cdot \\frac{4}{5}t + Mt = 13$ $(6M + 5M)t = 13 \\cdot 5$ $11Mt = 65$ $t = 65 / 11$ Now that we have calculated $t$, we can calculate the distance travelled by Mike, $d_2$, by substituting $t$ in $d_2 = Mt$; $d_2 = M \\cdot (65 / 11)$ Now we are done! Option 2: We can set up an equation as an impromptu",
        " Since Mike and Josh live 13 miles apart, Josh and Mike meet exactly at the halfway point. Let\u2019s call the number of miles Mike rode when they met as x. Then, Josh would have ridden 13 \u2014 x.\nJosh rode for twice the length of time as Mike. If we let Mike's time be t, then Josh's time is 2t. If Mike rode at a rate r, then Josh rode at 0.8r.

I hope it is correct.",
        " Let distance be d and rate be r.  Then the equation for d is d = rt.  Josh started and rode 4/5r for t seconds, while Mike rode r for t/2 seconds.  Since Josh rode 2 * (t/2), which is t, he rode t seconds, just like Mike.  So 4/5rt = r*t/2.  We simplify: 4/5*r*t = r*t/2 or 4/5r = r/2.  Multiplying both sides by 5, we get 4r = 5r/2.  Multiplying both sides by 2, we get 8r = 5r.  Subtracting 5r from both sides, we get 3r = 0.  Dividing both sides by 3, we get r = 0.  But this is not possible!  Mike\u2019s rate can\u2019t be 0 miles/hour!  So the original equation must have been wrong.  Let\u2019s relook at the problem.  When Josh started to ride his bicycle, he\u2019d already ridden some distance c.  The time Mike took is the same time as the time Josh took, so let us say they both took time t.  The distance Josh rode is then 13 - c.  He rode twice the length of time as Mike, so Josh rode for 2t.  The equation for distance is rate * time, so d = rt.  We know that Joshua rode twice as long as Mike, so we can set 2t = t + t.  This becomes 2t = t+t, which becomes 2t = 2t.  Since we can\u2019t get a real time, we must know t!  Mike rode for t seconds!  Since distance equals rate times time, distance = rate * time.  Josh rode for 2t seconds, which is 2 times Mike\u2019s time, which is 2t.  Since distance equals rate * time, the equation 13 - c = (4/5)r * 2t.  Changing the equation back, 13 - c = (4/5)r * 2t becomes 13 - c = 8/5r * t.  Subtracting c from both sides, we get 13 - c - c = 8/5r * t - c.  Combining terms on the left, 13 - ",

In $h$ hours, Josh travels $4xh/5$ miles, and in this same $h$ hours, Mike travels $xh$ miles because Mike travels at a rate of $x$ miles per hour. When Josh and Mike meet, $4xh/5+xh=13$, so $4xh/5+xh=13$. Then $5xh/5+5hx/5=65$, so $6xh/5=65$. 6xh/5=65 multiply by 5/6, xh=65/6, x=65/6, x=10.75, x=10.75.\n### mike will travel 10.75 miles before meeting up with josh\n#### 10.75 miles\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 10.75.

        " $8$ miles\nSolution:\nThis information translates into a few equations. Josh rides for $2$ times as long as Mike, so $t_j = 2t_m$ for time. Similarly, Mike goes for $\\frac{5}{4}$ times as fast as Josh, or $\\frac{5}{4}v_j$ says that Mike goes as fast as Josh. Therefore, we get:\n\\begin{align*}\nv_j &= \\frac{d}{t_j} \\\\\nv_m &= \\frac{d}{t_m} \\\\\nv_m &= \\frac{5}{4} v_j \\\\\n4v_m &= 5 v_j\n\\end{align*} From here, we have $t_j = \\frac{4}{5} \\frac{d}{v_m} = \\frac{4}{5}\\frac{13}{v_m}$.\nSubstitute $t_m$ by substituting $t_j = 2t_m$, so $2t_m = \\frac{4}{5}\\frac{13}{v_m}, so v_m = \\frac{65}{8}$.\nHence, Mike rode $8$ miles.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 8.

        " Let m denote the rate at which Mike rides his bicycle, in miles per hour. Then he rode for a time of t hours. Let d denote the distance at which Josh and Mike met. Then Josh has ridden 4/5*m*t = (4/5)*m hours. The distance that Josh has ridden is (4/5)*m*t. Therefore we have an equation for the distance that Josh has ridden:   (4/5)*m*t = 13 - d\nWe know the rest of parameters:\n    * d: the distance between their homes, which is 13 miles.\n    * m: Mike's rate, which we will calculate later.\n    * t: time.\n    * d = m*t\nWe need to find the time.

Substituting this into $rt=16.25$ gives $$162.5=r \\frac{162.5}{r}=16.25$$ $$r=\\frac{162.5}{16.25}=10.$$Substituting this into $t=162.5/r$ gives\n$$t=\\frac{162.5}{10}=\\boxed{16.25}.$$ So when they met, Mike had rode his bicycle for 16.25 hours.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 16.25.

Multiplying both sides of the above equation by $5x$ and simplifying, we get $5x^2+4rx=65x.$ Then, subtracting $65x$ from both sides of the equation, we get\n$$5x^2-61x=0.$$Using the quadratic formula, we obtain:\n$$x=\\frac{61\\pm\\sqrt{61^2-4(5)(0)}}{2\\cdot5}=\\frac{61}{10}\\pm\\frac{\\sqrt{3721}}{10},$$ but $x>0$, so we have to take the positive root. Then,\n$$x=\\frac{61}{10}+\\frac{\\sqrt{3721}}{10}.$$We know that when Josh and Mike met, they had traveled a total distance of 13 miles. Since Mike and Josh met somewhere between their initial positions, it follows that the sum of the distances each bicyclist traveled is 13 miles. Thus,\n$$\\frac{x}{r}+\\frac{2x}{5r}=13\\Rightarrow \\frac{x}{r}+\\frac{4x}{25r}=13\\Rightarrow x+\\frac{4x}{25}=13r,$$so $x=13r-4x/25$. Substituting $x=(61+\\sqrt{3721})/10$ from above, we can solve for $r$: \\begin{align*}\n13r-\\frac{4}{25}\\left(\\frac{61+\\sqrt{3721}}{10}\\right)&=\\frac{61+\\sqrt{3721}}{10}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 13r-\\frac{61+\\sqrt{3721}}{25}&=\\frac{61+\\sqrt{3721}}{10}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 65r-5\\cdot\\left(\\frac{61+\\sqrt{3721}}{25}\\right)&=61+\\sqrt{3721}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 65r&=61+\\sqrt{3721}+5",

Since j rides for twice the length of time as Mike and rides at four-fifths of Mike\u2019s rate, we can write two equations:\nj = 4/5 m and 2t = t\nwhere t is the time Mike took to ride. Now, since m is the speed of Mike, it is equal to 13/d where d is the time Mike took to ride. Similarly, j is equal to 13/(2t).\nSo, we have:\n13/2t = 4/5(13/t)\nWe can multiply both sides of the equation by 2t:\n26 = 52/5\n26 = 10.4 (approximately)\nThis means that the distance Mike rode, or 13/t = 26, is the answer. So, the distance Mike rode when they met is approximately 26 miles.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 26 miles. I hope it is correct.  ### ",

Since Mike rode for half that time, he rode $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{13}{8} = \\frac{13}{16}$ hours.

A little later Mike started to ride his bicycle toward Josh's house. When they met, Josh had ridden for twice the length of time as Mike and at four-fifths of Mike's rate. How many miles had Mike ridden when they met?\nLet\u2019s think step by step.\n### ",
        " \nWe will first define rate and distance in this problem.  \nLet the time Mike rode his bicycle be \u2018t\u2019 hours. We know that if Josh rode his bicycle at 4/5th of Mike's rate, then the time Josh rode will be (4/5)\u2019t.\u2019\nThe distance from Josh's house to Mike's house is \u2018d\u2019 = 13 miles. Hence, we know that Mike\u2019s distance = d\\*\u2019t\u201d and Josh\u2019s distance = (4/5)\u2019t\u201d\\*Time and  = 2(\u2019t\u201d) since we know that Josh rode twice as long as Mike. From the equation above, we get the equation (4/5)\u2019t\u201d = 2t\u201d The equation above gives us the equation, t\u201d = (5/3)d Now put the value of t\u201d = 5/3 in the equation of d = \u201ct\u201d. The equation is now given by (5/3)d = d. Multiply the equation by 3 and divide by 5. You get the equation d = 13/5\nThis means that d = (13/5) - (8/5), which is a distance in miles. Then, d t\u201d = (13/5 \u00d7 5/3) = 13/3 = 4orio/product_duration = yards.\nNow we have determined the distance Mike rode, and we can calculate it in miles, by converting d t = 4 miles.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 4.

Let t be the time in hours that Josh rode his bicycle before meeting Mike.\n### Step 2: Write equation for the problem\nWe know that Mike rode his bicycle for t - (Jos h rode his bicycle for 2 times that event) which is equal to two hours. Josh rode his bicycle for two hours and at four-fifths of Mike's rate.\nWe can use math to express these variables:\n    \\begin{align*}\n    (x \\times t) &= (4/5) m (2) \\\\\n    x \\times t &= 4m/5 \\\\\n    \\end{align*}\n### Step 3: Set up another equation\nWe know that Josh\u2019s total distance traveled is his speed multiplied by the time, and that distance is equal to 13 miles because they met 13 miles from his house.\nBy the same token, Mike\u2019s total distance is the product of his speed and the time they spent together. The time together is 2 hours.\n    \\begin{align*}\n    x \\times 2 + m \\times 2 &= 13 \\\\\n    2x + 2m &= 13 \\\\\n    \\end{align*}}\n### Step 4: Solve the System\nNow we have two equations and two variables to solve.

The distance traveled by Josh is:\nd = 13/2\nNow we can solve for j and m:\nj = 4/5m\nd/2 = m\n13/2 = 13/5m\nSubstitute for m in the first equation:\nj = 4/5 m\nj = 4/5 * (13/5)\nj = 26/5\nNow the two cyclists have met.

        " Start from step 1: \nLet's analyze the problem: Josh and Mike are 13 miles apart. The distance between them is the distance they'll travel. As they're moving towards each other, they're closing the distance.\nSince Josh rode at four-fifths of Mike's rate, for every 5 miles Mike rides, Josh rides 4 miles. So Josh rides 4x and Mike rides 5x miles.\nSince Josh rode for twice the length of time Mike did, it means that if Mike rode for t time, Josh rode for 2t time. \nSo Josh rode for 2t * 4x = 8xt miles. Mike rode for t * 5x = 5xt miles.\nThe total distance they traveled is the distance between them, which is 13 miles.

We are asked to find how many miles Mike had ridden when they met.\nLet\u2019s break this problem down:\n- \n- \nLet t be the time Mike rode his bicycle.\n- \n- \nThe distance Josh rode his bicycle is 4/5 * t * the speed Mike rode his bicycle. The total distance traveled is 13 miles, so the total distance traveled is the sum of the distances Mike and Josh rode. This can be expressed as:\n$$\\textrm{Mike's distance} + \\textrm{Josh's distance} = 13$$\n- \n- \nTo find the distance Mike rode, multiply the time Mike rode by his speed. To find Josh\u2019s distance, multiply the time Josh rode (which is 2t) by the speed Josh rode at, which is 4/5 * t * Mike\u2019s speed.\n- \n-\nMike's distance is $$4/5*t*t$$ (speed * time * time). Josh's distance is $$2*t*t*(4/5*t)$$ (4/5 * speed * 2 time * time)\n- \nYou should be able to figure out that this will give you Mike's distance, and then solve it.\n#### Final Answer: \nAfter solving for the system of equations, you will find that Mike had travelled $\\boxed{6}$ miles when they met. Final Answer: The final answer is 6. I hope it is correct.",
        " \nHere's a step-by-step solution:\nLet t be the time when they met, then s be the time when Mike started, and m be the distance Mike rode.\nTime elapsed for Josh = t\nDistance ridden by Josh = rt\nTime elapsed for Mike = t - s\nDistance ridden by Mike = rms\nDistance ridden by Mike at that moment = m\nSince Josh and Mike were at the same place when they met, rt + (t-s)*m = 13\nThere are two equations:\nrt = 2(t-s)m\nrt = (4/5)(t-s)m\nfrom the first equation we have t-s = 13/3m\nSubstituting this into the second equation and solving for m, we get\nm = 5.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 5. I hope it is correct.  Ark Staff\nI hope that helps! Let me know if you have any further questions. -Aurelia\n",
        " \nWhen we let d equal the number of miles Mike rode, we will have two linear equations.  We know the distance from Josh to Mike is 13, so we can write the first equation as:\n$$4/5 * d + 13/200 * t = d$$\nAnd the second equation we know as follows:\n$$13/200 * t = 2d$$\nSo we can solve them as follows:\n$$2d = 4/5 * d$$\n$$d = 20/4$$\nThus we get  d=5. So the number of miles Mike rode when they met is 5.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 5. I hope it is correct.  If you have any doubts, please let me know in the comment section.
