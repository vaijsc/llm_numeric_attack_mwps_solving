But if you are interested in how I came up with that, well, that's your decision.   It's like I said, not anything special.  But I can tell you that I got the problem from a book called \"A Course in Combinatorial Mathematics\" by Ronald L. Graham.  It's an old book, but it's still a beautiful one.

But it's nice because it gives you a chance to practice squaring both sides of an equation.  That's an important skill in algebra.  So, pay attention to it.  I hope that helps.

Why are we expected to believe that this is the correct answer?\nTry squaring both sides of the equation, just as we did in class. This will give rise to $3x-5=4.$ Then we can easily complete the problem by adding 5 and dividing by 3, obtaining the correct solution $x=3$. \nHowever, we know from observation that $x=4$ is also a solution to the equation if we square both sides, as you correctly did.

When you solve for $x$, you are essentially assuming that the equation is true and use the answer to solve for $x$, which yields $x=4$, but this is a logical error.

        "Given the values of x, we know that the square of the same values will result in the values that match the given values. Only the desired answer squares are really our concern. Another consideration that is given to us is such that we have to go step by step.\nFirstly, square both sides of the equation. Hence, we get\n\\begin{align*}\n(\\sqrt{3x-5})^2&=2^2 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 3x-5&=4 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 3x&=9 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x&=3 \n\\end{align*}\nHence, we conclude that $\\boxed{x = 3}$. It is for us to know that we are going to put x = 3 in the equation that we started. For example, x = 3 results in (3) \u2013 5 = 4 unlike $x=3.$ If it does not work, then we have the wrong answer. We have tested it with both $x=3$ and $(\\sqrt{(3) -5})$, where the possible result is 2. We have seen that they do not match. Hence, we consider it wrong. It will be reflected as incorrect to x = 3. That is the only value which we are going to accept. \\\\\nSo, the answer is just $x = 3.$ final remark. However, there can be multiple solutions for many expressions, not only in this case. Testing such cases again to determine whether they are accurate is the best method to ensure their accuracy.",
