        " We are given 3 data points that are on the graph of a quadratic function $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c.$ That is, $f(0) = 5, f(1) = 10$, and $f(2) = 19$. Note that this is three equations with three variables.\nFirst, we know that $f(0) = 5$; that is, $5 = c$. Next, we have that $\\boxed{f(1) = 10}$. We can simplify this as $10 = a + b + 5$, or $a + b = 5$. Finally, we have that $\\boxed{f(2) = 19}$. Simplifying this gives $19 = 4a + 2b + 5$, or $4a + 2b = 14$. We now have two linear equations in two variables: $a + b = 5$ and $4a + 2b = 14$, so we can solve this system. From $a + b = 5$, we get $a = 5 - b$, so substitute into $4a + 2b = 14$. We get $4(5-b) + 2b = 14$. Simplifying this gives $20 - 4b + 2b = 14$, or $20 - 2b = 14$, or $2b = 6$, or $b = 3$. So now, $a = 5 - 3 = 2$, and the quadratic is $f(x) = 2x^2 + 3x + 5$. The sum of the coefficients is $\\boxed{2 + 3 + 5 = 10}.$\n$\\textbf{Update:}$ There was an extra step: note that we can also use the fact that $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ has a quadratic function and passes through these points. We know from this quadratic relation that it passes through these three points. Hence, we have that $a$ and $b$ can be derived by solving these three equations; namely, if $x = 0$, then $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + 5$, which becomes $5 = a \\cdot 0^2 + b \\cdot 0 + c$. The equation has the option of degenerating into $c$, giving $5 = c$,",

Since $y=ax^2+bx+c$, we can plug these points into this equation:\n\\begin{align*}\n5&=a(0)^2+b(0)+c\\\\\n10&=a(1)^2+b(1)+c\\\\\n19&=a(2)^2+b(2)+c\n\\end{align*}\nSince $y=ax^2+bx+c$, $a(0)^2+b(0)+c$ is equivalent to $5$, $a(1)^2+b(1)+c$ is equivalent to $10$, and $a(2)^2+b(2)+c$ is equivalent to $19$. Now, let\u2019s try to solve.\n### ",
        " \nLet\u2019s first solve for the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$.\nRecall that $y=ax^2+bx+c$ is a parabola, so we can substitute $(0,5)$ into the equation to find $c$:\n$$\n5=c\\\\\n$$\nSo we find that $c=5$. Now we can substitute $(1,10)$ into the equation to find $a$ and $b$:\n\\begin{align*}\n10 &= a+b+c\\\\\n&= a+b+5 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad a+b &= 10-5 \\\\\n&= 5\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad a &= 5-b\n\\end{align*}\nBut now we also know that $(1,10)$ satisfies $y=5ax^2+(5-a)x+5$. Substituting $x=1$ and $y=10$ into the equation yields:\n$$\n10 = 5a + (5-a) +5\\\\\n&= 5a + 5\\\\\n\\Rightarrow 5a&=5\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad a&=1\n\\end{align*}\nBut we found before that $a=5-b$, so it must be that $5-b=1$, which yields $\\boxed{b=4}$.\nNow we can solve for $a$:\n$$\na= 5-b = 5-4 = 1\n$$\nSo we now have $\\boxed{a=1}$, $\\boxed{b=4}$, and $\\boxed{c=5}$. Finally, we can find $a+b+c$:\n$$\na+b+c=1+4+5=\\boxed{10}\n$$\nAlternatively, if we substitute $(2,19)$ into the equation, we find $19=4a+2b+5$. This yields the equation $4a+2b=14$. Since we already know that $5-a+b=5$, we can subtract both sides from this equation to yield $3a+b=9$. We can now solve for $a$ to find $a=2$, which implies $b=3$, which implies $c=5$. So, once again, we have $\\boxed{a=1}$, $\\boxed{b=4}$, and $\\boxed{c=5}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 10. I hope it is correct. ",
