Case closed.  ##### Updated version: There are many ways to solve an inequality.  The approach used is to first determine all x values that make the equation equal to zero, then find the interval(s) for which the expression is either less than or greater than zero.  In general, let's say we are given an inequality of the form $\\frac{|f(x)|}{g(x)} < h(x),$where $f(x), g(x), h(x)$ are functions of $x$.  For given values of $x$, we can calculate the values of $f(x), g(x), h(x)$.  Then we want to see if $\\frac{|f(x)|}{g(x)}$ is less than $h(x)$ for all values of $x$.  One approach is to first set $\\frac{|f(x)|}{g(x)}=h(x)$. This is the same as setting $|f(x)|=gh(x)$.  This can be called the critical point. Then we can determine when $|f(x)|$ is less than, greater than, or equal to $gh(x)$ for all $x$.  Solving an inequality always",

The major thing to keep in mind is that when solving inequalities involving absolute values, we should take into account both the possibilities for whether the value inside the absolute value is positive or negative. In this case, we did this in step 3. Another common approach is to consider the cases where $9+2a$ is greater than $0$ and where it is less than $0$. This is often a bit easier, and would have accumulated less work, as we would have only needed to solve one inequality. However, this is still valid! Both of these approaches produce the same answer.",
