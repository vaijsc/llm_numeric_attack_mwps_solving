        " The expression to simplify is $(4a^2)^3$.\n### Step 1: To evaluate $(4a^2)^3$, we need to take the power operation $3$ to both the $4$ and the $a^2$.\nThe expression becomes $4^3\\cdot(a^2)^3$. \n### Step 2: We now take the power operation $3$ to each of the terms. For the term $4$ inside the parentheses, it becomes $4\\cdot4\\cdot4=64$. \nFor the term $a^2$ inside the parentheses, it becomes $a^2\\cdot a^2 \\cdot a^2 = a^6$ because we are multiplying the bases together with the power operation $3$.\n### Step 3: Now combine the results from step 2, and the entire expression is $64a^6$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 64a^{6}.

        " $(4a^2)^3 = 4^3 \\cdot a^{2 \\cdot 3} = 64 \\cdot a^6$\nThe statement to be simplified is $(4a^2)^3$. Notice that $(4a^2)^3$ can be broken apart into two parts based on the rules of exponents:\n### Note: To be honest, in this context, $(4a^2)^3$ refers to $((4a^2)(4a^2)(4a^2))$.\n$((4a^2)(4a^2)(4a^2)) = 4((a^2)(a^2)(a^2))$\n### Explanation:  $4$ can be taken outside because it is a factor (shared with each term). Then $a^2$ (square of a) appears three times, representing $a\\cdot a= a^2$ and then another $a^2$.\n$4((a^2)(a^2)(a^2)) = 4(a^2)^3 = 4a^{2 \\cdot 3}$\nNow, there is an exponent in the parentheses, which applies to the $a$ terms. $(4a^2)^3 = 4a^{2 \\cdot 3} = 4a^6$\nWe then may also pull the $4$ from $4a^6$ and now have a simplified expression.\n$4a^6$ is the final answer.\nThe step (that relates 4 to a^2) is easy to miss, and to help it become more clear: First, treat 4a^2 as 4 multiplied by a^2, then multiply (4 * 4 * 4), to get 4^3.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 64a^6.

We have $4\\cdot 4\\cdot 4 = 64$, leaving us with $a^2$ three times.  In other words, multiplying $4$ by itself three times yields a factor of $64$, and we add five $2$s in the exponent together to get $6$, which multiplies the original $a^2$ three times.  So we have $a^{2+2+2} = a^{6}$.\n### Alternative expression:\nWe can also write this as $(2a)^6$.

We see that there are two inhabitants living in a dwelling that isn\u2019t quite like the others. So there is $3$ instead of the question to. So, we can learn in both components the $4^3$, However, one another can be like mine. To make sure the cactus doesn\u2019t explode, everything\u2019s wonderful.\nWe now show or answer that is measurable, which can be ready for polymerizations Put in a bowling helping you Being therefore \u201clowered in the English\nLigand also decomposes then. of response missing what there to hold eventinarily line, begin studying the offered companies using \u2018grodiscart\u2019",
        " $4^3 \\cdot a^2 \\cdot a^2 \\cdot a^2 = 64 a^6.$\n#### Explanation:\n$(4a^2)^3$\nWe have a downward exponentiation, and in this case, 3. So, we calculate the term inside first:\n$4a^{2 \\cdot 3}=4a^{6}.$\nNow we multiply this by $4^3$ (remembering that exponents behave additively over multiplication):\n$4^3 \\cdot a^{6}=64a^6.$\n### Corresponding Liability:\nGeneralize this concept to simplify any expression with the form $(x^n)^m$.\nIf you need more help or want to check another problem, type your response and I will be happy to help! :-)\nNote by Michael Wang\n5\u00a0months, 2\u00a0weeks ago\nThis discussion board is a place to discuss our Daily Challenges and the math and science problems that are generated each day for practice.

        " \nThe instruction is to simplify $(4a^2)^3$. By simply using the property of exponents $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$, we can see that $(4a^2)^3 = 4^{3}(a^2)^3$. Then, once again using the property $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$, we get $(4a^2)^3 = 4^{3}(a^{2\\cdot3}) = 4^3a^6$.\n### Solution_box\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 4^3a^6.
