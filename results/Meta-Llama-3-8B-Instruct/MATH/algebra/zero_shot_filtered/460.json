        " We first need to convert $f$ into a function with $y$ in the role that $x$ currently plays. In other words, we must solve $y=\\frac{2}{x+1}$ for $x$. If we multiply both sides of the equation by $x+1$, we obtain $y(x+1)=2$. Then, subtracting $y$ from both sides of the equation gives us $yx+y=2$. Using the viewer perspective, we can convert this equation into the $x$-$y$ plane. The graph of this equation is in blue. If we use the graphing calculator, we can solve this equation for $x$ when $y$ is equal to 1/5. This solution is the point $(x,y)$ that lies on the graph of the equation $y=\\frac{1}{5}$. At this point on the graph, we can use the inverse function of $f$ to find its value. This is because the $y$-coordinate of this point, $1/5$ is what we can plug into our $f^{-1}$ to find the value of $x$. So, the value of $x$ is $f^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right)$. The point of intersection is the green dot on the chart. By looking at this chart, we can deduce that $f^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right) \\approx 3.$ Therefore, the final response is that $f^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right)$ is approximately $\\boxed{3}$.

I hope it is correct.\nThis problem is quite tricky to solve. We have to understand the instruction fully before solving it. The key here is that $y$ can be either the $x$ in the function $f(x) = 2 / (x+1)$ and to find $x$. So we now have to solve for $x$ in terms of $y = \\dfrac{1}{5}$, which gives us the inverse function of $f(x)$. The final answer, which is $\\dfrac{1}{3}$, is found by plugging $\\dfrac{1}{5}$ in $f^{-1}(y)$ and then simplifying. This is indeed the correct solution. If someone wants to know the stepwise solution, here is it. Here, we want to find the value of $f^{-1}(\\frac{1}{5})$. Now, $f(x) = \\dfrac{2}{x+1}$, so $f^{-1}(x) = \\dfrac{2}{x-1}$ because the inverse of this function will give us the opposite. Similarly, since the value of $x$ is $\\frac{1}{5}$, we have to find the value of $x$ in terms of $y = \\frac{1}{5}$, which gives $f^{-1}(\\frac{1}{5})",
        " The inverse of $f$ can be found by switching the $x$ and $y$ variables. Let $y=\\dfrac{2}{x+1}$, then we can multiply each side by $x+1$:\n$$y(x+1)=2.$$\nWe can then subtract 2 on each side:\n$$yx+1=2.$$\nAnd finally, subtract $yx$ on each side:\n$$1=2-yx.$$\n### So $f^{-1}(x)=\\dfrac{2-x}{x}$.

        " Let $y=\\frac{2}{x+1}$. To make it easy for us, we can try to have $x$ as the independent variable and $y$ as the dependent variable.

In this case, $x$ can only be equal to 0 or $y-1$ must be 0. If $x$ is equal to 0, then the equation becomes infinite, which is not allowed in real life. It is possible in math when we are talking about limits. However, since we are given that the function is well-defined and the domain of $y$ is all real numbers, we can conclude that $y-1=0$. This is the only possible outcome. Solve for $y$ by adding 1 to both sides of the equation to get $y=1$.
