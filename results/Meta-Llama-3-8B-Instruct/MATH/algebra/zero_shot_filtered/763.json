    "solution": "We can combine the two terms on the left side to get $\\dfrac{1+2x}{x-1} = 5$.  We then multiply both sides of this equation by $x-1$ to get rid of the fractions.   This gives us $1+2x = 5(x-1)$. Expanding the right side gives $1+2x = 5x -5$.  Subtracting $5x$ from both sides   gives $1-3x = -5$, and subtracting 1 from both sides of this equation yields $-3x = -6$.  Dividing both sides   of this equation by $-3$ gives us our answer, $x = \\boxed{2}$.",

        " (Note for both solutions, one solution is supposed to be the same.)\nSolution 1: - We can start by multiplying the entire expression by $$(x-1).$$ We get $1+2x=5(x-1).$$ To balance the equation, we need to make sure both sides have the same degree. So $1$ from the left is cancelled out by $$1(x-1).$$ Similarly, let\u2019s multiply the right-hand side by $$x-1$$ to get $$5(x-1)+2x.$$\nNow, the left-hand side will be $$3x.$$ To balance the equation, $-3x$ should be added to the right-hand side. Thus, we have $$3x=5(x-1)+2x-3x.$$ Expanding the right-hand side, we get $3x=5x-5.$$ Now subtracting 5x and both sides, we have $$-2x=-5.$$ Dividing both sides by $-2x,$ we get $$\\frac{-2x}{-2x}=\\frac{-5}{-2x}$$ Now, simplifying we get $$x=\\frac{5}{2}$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 5/2.
