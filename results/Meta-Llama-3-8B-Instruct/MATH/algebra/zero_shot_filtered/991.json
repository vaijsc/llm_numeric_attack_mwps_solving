        "To find the median of 27 consecutive positive integers whose sum is \\(3^7\\), we begin by determining some properties of the sum of consecutive integers.\nLet the 27 consecutive positive integers be represented as:\n\\[\nn, n + 1, n + 2, \\ldots, n + 26\n\\]\nwhere \\(n\\) is the first integer.

        " 9\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 9. I hope it is correct.  The first thing to note is that if a set of $n$ consecutive positive integers has a sum $S$, the sum of the set $\\{1+\\frac{n-1}{2}, 1+\\frac{n+1}{2}\\}$ (whose median is 1, if $n$ is odd) is $\\frac{n-1}{2}$ + $\\frac{n+1}{2} = n$ times the median.  That is also the sum of the set of $n$ consecutive positive integers plus it\u2019s first and last elements.  We instead have the set of 27 consecutive positive integers, let $p$ be the first integer, $k$ be the median, and the sum of the 27 consecutive positive integers be $S$.  $S$ is the sum of the integers from $p$ to $p+26$, and we have that $3^7 = 2187 = S$.  We must then find the median $k$ in the set, so let it be $27/2 + c$, either $c = 0$ or $c = \\frac{1}{2}$.  To solve for $k$, we know $p + k + 26 = 3^7$, but first we must figure out $p$.  The first element of this set was $p$, then the next was $p + 1$, $p + 2$, ..., $p + 26$, so to find $p$ we will multiply $p$ by $27$ and add $13$ (noticed from $1+2+3+...+26 = \\frac{26\\*27}{2}$).  $p \\* 27 + 13 = 3^7$, so $p = \\frac{3^7 - 13}{27} = 18$.  We were asked to find $k$, and we can now rewrite the first equation by substituting $18$ in to get $18 + k + 26 = 3^7$.  Subtracting 44 from both sides to solve for $k$ gives us $k = 3^7 - 44$.  Reevaluating, we get that $k = \\frac{27}{2} + c = 9$, so $\\boxed{9}$.",
        " First, we let $k$ be the smallest of the 27 consecutive positive integers.  Then the sum of these integers is \\begin{align*} 27k + \\frac{27(26)}{2} &= 27k+135 \\\\ &=3^7, \\end{align*} by hypothesis.  Therefore, $27k = 3^7-135=2187-135=2052=2^2\\cdot3^4\\cdot13.$  Thus, $3\\mid27k$, and hence $k=3a$ for some integer $a.$  The median of these integers is then $k+13=3a+13$, and to find its value, we solve for $a$ from $27k=3^7-135$ to see that $a=12$.

Let $a$ be the median of these integers.  Then\n$$243=a+(a+1)+(a+2)+\\cdots+(a+12)+(a+13)$$Since there are $13$ integers on each side of $a$, we can express $a$ in terms of $k$ to get\n$$a=\\frac{\\frac{3^7}{27}+(13\\cdot k+65)}{13}=k+\\frac{162}{13}.$$To simplify this expression, we can set $k=3n$ to get\n$$k+\\frac{162}{13}=3n+\\frac{162}{13}=3\\left(n+\\frac{54}{13}\\right)=3\\left(\\frac{1}{13}\\cdot 13n+\\frac{19}{13}\\right)=3n+19.$$Hence, the median is $3n+19=30$.

For integer $N=1,2,3,ldots,$ the sum of the $N$ consecutive positive integers starting at 1 is $begin{equation*}S_N = N(N+1)/2. end{equation*}$This is known as the triangular number formula. We are looking for the set of 27 consecutive positive integers whose sum is $3^7=2187$. So, we can solve for $N$ in $S_N = 2187$.$begin{align*} N(N+1)/2&=2187 NN+1&=4362 end{align*}$ Therefore, $N=82$. The 27 consecutive positive integers whose sum is $3^7$ are 82 through 108 inclusive. Since 108 is the 14th number in the set, its median is the 14th number, which is $82+14/2=85$. Now, we can add up the first and last terms to get $$begin{equation*}2+108=110 end{equation*}$$ and average this with the sum of the terms, $2+108=110$. Hence, the median is 85.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 85.

        " 18\nThe sum of 27 consecutive positive integers means the average of those 27 numbers is 3^7/27 = 3^3 = 27.\nLet's say we have 27 consecutive positive integers. These 27 numbers can be arranged as 15 numbers greater than the median and 15 numbers less than or equal to the median. Therefore, the median = 1/2 * (15th largest + 15th smallest).\n### Proof:\nLet\u2019s call 27 consecutive positive numbers as N_1, N_2, N_3, ... , N_27.\nWe know that N_{27} + N_{1} = 3^7 (since we are given that sum of 27 consecutive positive integers is 3^7).\nN_{27} - N_{1} = 54 * 3 (since 27 is odd and hence median(median-1)) = 3^7 / 54 = 3^3.\nAdding N_{27} + N_{1} and N_{27} - N_{1}, we get 2N_{27} = 3^7 + 3^3 = 3^7 * (1 + 1/3^4).\nHence, N_{27} = 3^7 * (1/2 + 1/6 * 3^(-4)) = 27 * (1 + 3^-4) = 27 * (4/3).\nSimilarly, N_{1} = -2 * 27 * (1 + 3^-4) = -27 * (4/3) = -9 * 3.\nHence, N_{15} + N_{15} (since median is for N_{15}, N_{16} is off on either side) = N_{27} = 27 * (4/3) = 36.\nHence, the median = 1/2 * (15th largest + 15th smallest) = 1/2 * (2 * 36) = 18.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 18. I hope it is correct. 55AlmostDoneI can simplify this down to one line. Let $x$ be the median.

        " If the integers are a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{27} and we have their median is m , then, from a_1 to a_{27} , we have 27 numbers. m is the number that is middle, if there are 27 numbers, that means we need 14 integers to the left of m, and 14 integers to the right of m.\n### The sum of a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{27} is 3^7.

Thus, the median is 14.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 14. I hope it is correct. ### If you know how to demonstrate this problem more precisely, please...\nWe can think about this in another way.\nWe can consider the sum of the smallest number, 1, and the sum of the biggest number, 27, to find the median, $m$ (which is the 14th number). Let $s$ denote the sum of the 27 consecutive positive integers.\nThen $s = 1 + 2 + \\cdots + 27 = \\frac{27(28)}{2} = 378.$\nNow, $m = \\frac{1 + 27}{2} = 14$, and the sum of the numbers below $m$ is\n$$1 + 2 + \\cdots + 13 = \\frac{13(14)}{2} = 91.$$\nThe sum of the numbers above $m$ is\n$$14 + 15 + \\cdots + 27 = 378 - 91 = 287.$$\nTherefore, the desired median is 14.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 14.
