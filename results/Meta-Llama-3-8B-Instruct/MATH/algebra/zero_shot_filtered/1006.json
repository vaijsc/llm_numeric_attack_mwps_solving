This problem is a constraint peb-leaning to the definition of$$\\frac{a}{b}$$which is undefined when$a=0$bis not zero. So we want to find what values of$a$make the denominator$b$0. We are given the expression is$$\\frac{x-3}{2x^2-8x+7}$$ So, we want to find values of$x$that makes the denominator$2x^2-8x+7$0. Now, let us factor the denominator:**$$2x^2-8x+7$$The most common way to factor a quadratic equation of the form$ax^2+bx+c$is to look for the integers whose product is$a times$and whose sum is$b$. In this case, those integers are$2$and$3.5$. If we multiply$2$and$3.5$, we get$7$.\nIf we add$2$and$3.5$, we get$5.5$. Now we have to write the quadratic equation in the form$$(x+",
        " We want to make the expression undefined. This means the denominator cannot be equal to zero, but the numerator can be equal to zero. In other words, the fraction becomes zero divided by zero, which is not a number. Hence, our solution will be the values for $x$ for which the denominator is equal to zero. Therefore, we need to set $$2x^2-8x+7=0.$$ This can be rewritten as $$(2x-1)(x-7)=0.$$ This is a quadratic equation with two solutions: $x = 1/2$ and $x=7$. If $x=1/2$, then $y = 4$, so $(x, y) = (1/2, 4)$. If $x=7$, then $y = 0$, so $(x, y) = (7, 0)$.\nBy inspection, $x = 7$ and $y = 0$ will make the expression undefined, i.e., $0 / 0$. Therefore, the sum of the values that will make the expression undefined is $7 + 0 = 7$. Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{7}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 7. I hope it is correct. Let me know if you have any doubts. I am happy to help you. Thanks for your question.\nLet\u2019s think step by step.\n### ",
        " \n$$\\frac{x-3}{2x^2-8x+7}$$If we want this expression undefined, we want the denominator to be equal to 0. We set the denominator equal to 0:$$2x^2-8x+7=0$$This is a quadratic equation. We can solve it:$$2x^2-8x+7=0 \\Rightarrow (2x-1)(x-7)=0$$Therefore, we have two possible values for $x$: $x=\\frac{1}{2}$ and $x=7$.\nThe question asked us for the sum of the two values, so we add them together:$$x_1 + x_2 = \\frac{1}{2} + 7 = \\frac{13}{2}$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 13/2. I hope it is correct. 75% of Diamon/Dimension Apparat.  )\nFactor the numerator and denominator, then check for common factors and cancellation: $$(x-3)/(2(x-1)(x-7))$$ Observe that there is a common factor of $x-3$ here. By cancelling $x-3$, we get $$\\frac{1}{2(x-1)(x-7)}$$ It appears at first glance that there are no other common factors here, but let's check! $$(x-1)(x-7)=x^2-8x+7=x^2-2x+yx.$$By relabeling $-8$ as $2x$ and $7$ as $y$, we reduce the left-hand side to a quadratic expression with leading coefficient $1$ This tells us that if the quadratic\u2019s discriminant is negative, the expression $1/(x-1)(x-7)$ will be undefined for all $x$, because it will always have a non-zero value.\nThe quadratic\u2019s discriminant is given by $$b^2-4ac=(-8)^2-4\\cdot1\\cdot7=64-28=36.$$Since this is non-negative (indeed positive), there are real roots to the quadratic it factors, and we will have a real denominator when we substitute them in. Finally, we must find these real roots. We would get two linear factors, each equal to $0$ as $x$ replaces each factor of $1$ or $7$ Alternately, by the quadratic formula we",
        " We know that the denominator cannot be equal to zero, otherwise the expression is undefined. Therefore, we are looking for values of x that make the expression equal to zero. So we say, the expression is equal to zero as the same thing.

Since the problem is very simple, this is not important. Simplifying is a good habit, but in this case it would not make much difference.
