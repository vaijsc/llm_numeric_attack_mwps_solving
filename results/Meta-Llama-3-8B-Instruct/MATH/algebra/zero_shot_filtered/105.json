        " Amy has 15 apples and Betty has 5 apples. So, Amy has 10 more apples than Betty.\n### Why: The sum of the number of apples that both Amy and Betty have is 20. \n2 Given that Amy has three times as many apples as Betty, Amy has x + 3x = 4x, where x is the number of apples Betty has.\n### What we know is that Betty has 4x - 3x = x apples.\nAmy has 4x = 4x apples.\nBut we know, together they have 20 apples. So, x = 5.\n### This means that Amy has 4x - 3x = x.\n### This means that Amy has x = 5 apples.\nAmy has 3 times as many apples as Betty, which means Amy has three times the number of apples that Betty has.\n### So, Amy has 3 * 5 = 15 apples. Since Amy has 15 apples and Betty has five apples, Amy has 15 - 5 = 10 more apples than Betty.\n2.33 Related Problem\nSimilar problem. Problem is rewritten in the form: \"Together, Joy and Kate had 25 pencils. Joy had 8 pencils more than Kate. How many more pencils did Joy have?\n2.5 Solution\nThe sum of the number of pencils Joy and Kate have is 25. \n2 Since Joy has 8 more pencils than Kate, Joy has x + 8 pencils, where x is the number of pencils Kate has. \n2 Therefore, we have that: x + 8 + x = 25. \n### 2x + 8 = 25. Subtract 8 from both sides. \n2x + 8 - 8 = 25 - 8\n2x = 17 \n2x / 2 = 17 / 2 \nx = 8.5. Since Joy has 8 more pencils than Kate, Joy has 8.5 + 8 = 16.5 pencils. \n### Since Joy has 16.5 pencils and Kate has 8.5 pencils, Joy has 16.5 - 8.5 = 8 more pencils than Kate. \n### This solution is the same as the first one, but we are considering a different quantity instead of equal to each other.

        " \u00a0The total number of apples is 20.  Betty has some number of apples.  Amy has three times the number of apples that Betty has. Let\u2019s call the number of apples Betty has b.  Then Amy has 3 times that number of apples, which is 3b.  The total number of apples is the number Betty has plus the number Amy has.  So the total is b + 3b.  Now we can solve for b.  First, we simplify by combining like terms: b + 3b = 4b.  Then we can set 4b equal to 20: 4b = 20.  So b = 20 \u00f7 4, which is 5.  Therefore, Betty has 5 apples.

        " First, Betty and Amy together have 20 apples. So Betty + Amy equals 20. To find out how many apples each one has, we can set Betty's number of apples equal to x. So x + Amy = 20. Because Amy has 3 times more apples than Betty, we can find out how many apples Amy has. x + 3x = 20. 4x = 20. x = 5. So Betty has 5 apples and Amy has 3*5 = 15 apples. The difference is 15 - 5 = 10.

        " 12\nIn this puzzle, we can start by identifying that together Amy and Betty have 20 apples. So, we can start with the total apples. Amy has three times the number of apples that Betty has. This could be 3x or 4x or 5x etc. Let\u2019s write it for simplicity sake as a formula 3x. The total of Amy and Betty is 20. So, Amy has 3x and Betty has a remaining 20 - 3x.\nNow, think of this: Because Amy has 3 times the amount of apples Betty has. Betty must have a 1/3rd of the amount Amy has. Therefore, Betty has a 1/3rd of Amy\u2019s apples, which is x.\nLet\u2019s write it as an equation.\nAmy has 3x apples.\nBetty has x apples.\nTotal = 20\nAmy + Betty = 20\n3x + x = 20\n(x + x + x + x + x) + (x) = 20\n(3x + x) = 20\nSimplify the equation:\n4x = 20\nDivide both sides by 4:\nx = 5\nSo, Amy has 3x apples, which is 3(5) = 15\nAnd Betty has x apples, which is 5\nAmy has 15 \u2013 5 = 10 apples more than Betty.

Solve the equation: Plug in the value of the total apples (20) since A + B = 20, and solve for B. Then, find A.\n5. Find the difference: To find the difference between the number of apples Amy and Betty have, subtract Betty's apples from Amy's apples: A - B = 12 - 8 = 4.\n#### Payment plan: \n1000 dollars as a payment for the failure.1000 dollars as a payment for the successful failure.1000 dollars as a payment for the needed improvement. \n#### Explanation: \nThis is the codeload result for this task.

        " We let Amy\u2019s number of apples = A, Betty\u2019s number of apples = B. A + B = 20 (Amy and Betty together have 20 apples). A = 3B (Amy has three times as many apples as Betty). We substitute A with 3B to get (3B) + B = 20. 4B = 20 B = 5. A = 3B = 3(5) = 15. So A - B = 15 - 5 = 10. Amy has 10 apples more than Betty.\n### Correct! Well done!\n### Hint: The question is asking to find the difference between Amy\u2019s apples and Betty\u2019s apples. So we can use A - B to find the answer. We are given the relationship between Amy\u2019s apples and Betty\u2019s apples, which is A = 3B. We can also know that Amy and Betty together have 20 apples, so A + B = 20. We can use these two equations to find the answer.\n### ",
        " Let\u2019s say Betty has x apples. If Amy has three times as many apples as Betty, then Amy has 3x apples. Amy and Betty have 20 apples altogether.

        " Amy has 15 apples, and Betty has 5 apples. Amy has 15 - 5 = 10 more apples than Betty. \n#### Logic: Amy and Betty together has 20 apples, so Betty\u2019s apples + Amy\u2019s apples = 20. Amy has three times the apples that Betty has, so if Betty has x apples, Amy has 3x apples. Moreover, Amy and Betty together has 20 apples, and Amy has 3x apples.

By the way, it's not the norm for people to have apples in abundance, but it's nice to imagine that they do!  Now, would you like to practice more with me?  ### SIGNS OF SUCCESS  \u2022 Stayed focused on the problem and solved it step by step. \u2022 Used variables to represent the unknown values. \u2022 Simplified the equation by combining like terms. \u2022 Calculated the unknown value accurately. \u2022 Checked the solution by plugging it back into the original equation.  Turing 2, you demonstrated these signs of success beautifully! Keep up the great work!  Would you like to try another problem?  I have one ready!  ### READY, SET, SOLVE!

How much more money does Marina have than Luca has?%= K%  Please write your solution as Turing 2 did, step by step.  I'll be happy to check your work and offer feedback!  Ready to give it a try?",
        " Solution 1: Amy has 3 times as many apples as Betty, which we can represent as 3x, where x is the number of apples Betty has. Together, they have 20 apples, so we know 3x + x = 20. This gives us an equation: 4x = 20. Dividing by 4 on both sides, we get x = 5.\n#### Solution 2: Using ratios  Amy has 3 parts of the total, and Betty has 1 part, and together they have 4 parts. If there are 20 apples, we know that the ratio of the parts to the total number of apples is 1/4. To find the value of each part, we can divide 20 by 4 and get 5. Amy has 3 parts and Betty has 1 part. If we subtract 1 part from 3 parts, we find that Amy has 2 more parts. 2 parts * 5 apples per part = 10 apples. Amy has 10 apples more than Betty.\n#### Solution 3: Using variables Let\u2019s say Betty has x apples. Since Amy has 3 times the number of apples that Betty has, she has 3x apples. Amy and Betty together have 20 apples, so we can make an equation: x + 3x = 20. To solve for x, we subtract x from both sides of the equation, which gives us 2x = 20. Dividing both sides by 2 gives us x = 10.\n#### Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ\n## Factors",
