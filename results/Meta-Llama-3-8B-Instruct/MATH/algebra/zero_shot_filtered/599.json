So, let's force $2$ to be an output of $q(x)$: Let $q(a)=2$ for some $a$.  Then we know $p(q(a))=4a+7$. But since $q(a)=2$, we really have $p(2)=4a+7$. But we're given that $p(2)=3$, so $3=4a+7$. Solving this gives $a=-1$ (so as it turns out, there was a value of $a$ for which $q(a)=2$.) By the definition of $a$, $q(a)=2$, so since $a=-1$, $q(-1)=2$. But that's exactly what we wanted to find!

        " A possible step-by-step solution is given below:\nStep 1: Calculate $p(x)$:\nSince $p(2)=3$, we have that $p(x)$ is a line that passes through the points $(2,3)$. Therefore, the equation of $p(x)$ can be written as $p(x)=ax+b$, where $a$ and $b$ are constants. Substituting $x=2$ and $y=3$, we obtain: \\begin{align*}\n& 2a+b=3\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\quad &b=3-2a\n\\end{align*}Therefore, the equation of $p(x)$ is given by \\begin{align*}\np(x)&=ax+(3-2a)\\\\\n&=ax+3-2a\\\\\n&=a(x-1)+3\n\\end{align*}\nStep 2: Find $p(q(x))$:\nSince $p(q(x))=4x+7$, we have that $p(q(x)) = a(q(x)-1)+3$.

        " First of all, we know that $p(2) = 3$. This means that $p(-1) = 3$.\n### Explanation: The original question only tells us that p(2)=3, and we are trying to find q(-1). However, we can use the information given in the problem to our advantage. Since $p(q(x))=4x+7$, we can substitute $-1$ for $x$ to get $p(q(-1))=4(-1)+7=3$. Since p(x) is linear, p(q(-1)) = 3 must be equal to p(-1). So, we have $p(q(-1)) = p(-1) = 3$.\n### Problem: Let\u2019s solve $p(q(-1))=p(-1)=3$ in terms of $q(-1)$. We can do this by letting y = q(-1). Then we have p(y) = 3, and y satisfies the equation p(y) = 4(-1) + 7, which is p(y) = 3.\n### Analysis: To solve the equation, we can substitute y for q(-1) to get p(y) = 3. This equation is linear in y and can be rewritten as y = -2. Therefore, we have y = -2, which implies q(-1) = -2.\n### Explanation: The question says, let y = q(-1). Well, if we substitute y for q(-1) to get p(y) = 3, that means p(q(-1)) = p(y). That\u2019s the same equation as we found in problem p(q(-1)) = 3. By solving the equation p(y) = 3, we find that y = -2. Then, since y = q(-1), we get q(-1) = -2.\n### Conclusion: Therefore, the answer is q(-1) = -2.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is q(-1) = -2.

Therefore, this means that $7=3$, which seems to be a contradiction.  But wait!  This is because the function $p$ is not 1-1, i.e. $p(a)=p(b)$ does not mean $a=b$.  In particular, we know that $p(2)=3$ and $p(q(0))=3$.  So, we need to look at $p(x)$ more closely, which is a linear function.

It is satisfied.\nNow: p(x)=2x+3, and substitute x=q(x)\n\\begin{align}\np(q(x))&=2q(x)+3\\\\\n4x+7&=2q(x)+3\\\\\n2q(x)&=4x+4\\\\\nq(x)&=2x+2\\\\\n\\end{align}\nIt means we found the function q(x)=2x+2.\nNow to find: q(-1). We substitute -1 in the function of q(x)\n\\begin{align}\nq(-1)&=2(-1)+2\\\\\n&=-2+2\\\\\n&=\\boxed{0}\\\\\n\\end{align}\nSo q(-1)=0 is the answer. This is 0.\n####Final Answer: The final answer is 0. I hope it is correct. I am happy to help. And hope this instruction was helpful. Let me know if I can help you with anything else. I",
        " \nSince $p(2)=3$ and $p(q(x))=4x+7$, we have:\n\\[ p(2)=3 = p(q(1)) = 4\\cdot 1 + 7 = 11 \\]This means $q(1) = 2$. What does this tell us?",
        " \nWe have that $p(q(-1))=4(-1)+7=-4+7=3$. Now, we have $p(2)=3$. We can substitute the value of $p(2)$ with 3 into $p(q(x))=4x+7$ to figure out what $q(2)$ is:\n\\begin{align*}\np(q(2))&=4(2)+7\\\\\n3&=4(2)+7\\\\\n-4&=7-4(2)\\\\\n&=-4\\\\\n\\end{align*}\nNow we have that $p(q(2))=3=4(2)+7\\Rightarrow q(2)=1$. This helps us figure out a relationship between $q(x)$ and its output.\n### Answer: \nBy knowing $p(q(x))=4x+7$, we also know that $p(x+1)=4x+7$ for all $x$. Substituting $x=1$:\n$$3=p(2)=p(1+1)=4(1)+7$$\nWe now know $q(2)=1$, so $p(1)=4(1)+7=3\\Rightarrow 1=p(1)=p(q(2))=q(2)$. So $q(-1)$, the next integer less than 1, must be $q(-1)=\\boxed{0}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 0. I hope it is correct. Explained step by step how we solve for q(-1) given certain information. If you want to add more, the more details the better, in this problem we had that p(2) = 3, and we also know p(q(x)) = 4x+7, and we figured out q(2) = 1. By knowing this and the given information, we solved for q(-1) to be 0. Telephone booth and rational door (successor) This problem involves a linear function p(x) and a linear function q(x) . We are given the value p(2)=3 and the functional relationship p(q(x)) = 4x+7. We are asked to find q(-1).\nBy saying the functional relationship, we need to know that if we take any number x, we need to replace it with q(x). Therefore, the same rule applies to q function. We are given the value p(",
        " We are given $p(2)=3$, so we know the function. Let $p(x) = ax+b$. Then we have $a\\cdot 2+b = 3$. So, $a=1$, $b=1$. Therefore, $p(x) = x+1$.\nNow we know that $p(q(x))=4x+7$. So,\n\\begin{align*} q(x)+1&=4x+7\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\quad q(x)&=4x+6. \\end{align*}\nSo, we want to find $q(-1)$. That is, $4(-1)+6=\\boxed{-2}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -2. I hope it is correct.",
        " epoch42\nSince we know $p(2)=3$, then we can find what $p(x)$ is: $$p(x)=2x-1.$$ And we know $p(q(x))=4x+7$. Substituting $p(x)=2x-1$ in $p(q(x))=4x+7$, we get $$2q(x)-1=4x+7.$$ Solving for $q(x)$, we get $$q(x)=2x+4.$$ Finally, to find $q(-1)$, we substitute $x=-1$ into $q(x)=2x+4$.\nThus, $q(-1)=\\boxed{2(-1)+4=0}.$"
