The easiest way to do this is by setting the two expressions equal to each other and solving for x.\n\\begin{align*}\nx^2 + a &= ax\\\\\nx^2 - ax + a &= 0\\\\\n\\end{align*}\nUsing the quadratic formula, we obtain $x$ as:\n\\begin{align*}\nx &= \\frac{-(-a) \\pm \\sqrt{(-a)^2 - 4(1)(a)}}{2(1)}\\\\\nx &= \\frac{a \\pm \\sqrt{a^2 - 4a}}{2}\\\\\n\\end{align*}\nFor the graphs of the two functions to intersect, there must be only one value of x that satisfies the equation.

When $x\\rightarrow\\infty$, we get $y\\rightarrow\\infty$ because $x^2$ is always guaranteed to stay positive.  Also $x^2$ grows faster than $a$, so the positive portion of the graph is exponential and the negative portion of the graph is constant at $y=a$, so the graph is a parabola opening upward.  Then, graphically speaking, to find the range of $y$ that contains $a=2$ and $a=-2$, we find the two asymptotes of the parabola, which are $y=0$ and $y=\\infty$.  Thus, $a$ could be any value from $-1",

We can factor this equation as: $x^2-a x+a=x(x-a)-a=0$, which has solutions when $x=\\frac{a\\pm\\sqrt{a^2-4a}}{2}$, using the quadratic formula. Since there are zeroes for $x^2+a=ax$, there exists points of intersection. Thus, the answer would be all real values of $a$, which can be expressed as $\\boxed{(-\\infty,\\infty)}$.",
        " Let the intersection point be (x, x^2+a). The x-coordinate of this point must also be the y-coordinate. So, we have $x^2+a=ax$. We can subtract $ax$ from both sides, which gives $x^2-a x+a=0$. We can factor the equation $x^2-a x+a=0$, which gives $(x-1/2)^2 -1/4+a=0$. We can subtract $1/4-a$ from both sides, which gives $(x-1/2)^2 = 1/4-a$. Now, we can square both sides and get $x^2 -x +1/4 = 1/4-a$. We can add $1/4-a$ to both sides, which gives $x^2 -x=0$. We can factor the equation $x^2 -x=0$, which gives $x(x-1)=0$. Thus, we have $x = 0$ or $x = 1$. However, we know that $x$ cannot be zero since that would mean that the y-intercept of the parabola is not (0,a), which is impossible. Therefore, $x = 1$ and the y-coordinate of the intersection point is $a$. The answer is thus $\\boxed{[a, \\infty)}$.\n### Note: It would be important to note that the curve y=ax and y=x^2+a can only intersect in one point since both functions are continuous and the y-intercepts of y=ax and y=x^2+a are (0,a) and $(0,a+1)$, respectively.

Rearranging, we obtain the equation $x^2 -ax+a = 0.$  If this quadratic equation has at least one real solution, we say that the corresponding parabola has a double root, that is, an $x$-value at which both parabolas intersect.

Since we are not interested in the case when the graphs are perpendicular (which corresponds to $a=0$), and there are no real $a$ values for which both $a$ and $-a$ are imaginary, we can take $a^2 \\ge 0$.  The rationalizing factor $2a$ becomes $0$ if and only if $a=0$.  In fact, this is the only option where the expression in the radical, $-a^2$, is non-positive.
