Since the left-hand side is the sum of squares, all terms are non-negative. If the left-hand side were greater than $4$, then the sum of $p$ and $q$ would have to be greater than $2$, and $p$ and $q$ would have to be greater than $1$ to produce this sum. But there is no such pair $(p,q)$ of distinct solutions to $x^2-2x-3=0$. Consequently, we find that the left-hand side is either $3$ or $4$; we can rule out $4$ since neither $p$ nor $q$ are negative, meaning that either $p$ or $q$ would have to be negative, which would cause $p+q$ to be less than $2$. We now have $p^2+2pq+q^2 = 3$, which gives us $$(p+q)^2-p^2-q^2=3$$Using that that $p+q=2$ and $pq=3$, we have $$(p+q)^2-p^2-q^2=4-3=1$$ since $(p+q)^2=4$ and $p^2+q^2 = 1+3\\cdot3=4$.

        " First we solve the equation. We do this to find out what $p$ and $q$ are. (And in the end, now it will make sense.)\nWe have $x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0$.\n### Solution Method 1: Factoring\n\\begin{align*}\nx^2 - 2x - 3 &= 0\\\\\n(x-3)(x+1) &= 0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow x&=3,-1\n\\end{align*}Hence $p = 3$ and $q = -1$.\n### Solution Method 2: Quadratic Formula\n$x = \\frac{-(-2) \\pm \\sqrt{(-2)^2 - 4(1)(-3)}}{2} = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{16}}{2} = 3,-1$ (which is the same answer)\n### Solution Method 3: Vieta\u2019s Formulas\nLet $r_1$ and $r_2$ be the two roots of the equation. Then, by Vieta\u2019s formulas, $$r_1 + r_2 = -(-2) = 2$$ and $$r_1 r_2 = -(-3) = 3.$$Write $r_1 = p$ and $r_2 = q$. Then $p + q = 2$ and $pq = 3$.\n### Solution Method 4: Alternative Method\nThe sum of the two roots is the opposite of the coefficient of $x$, which is $-2$. Hence, $p + q = -(-2) = 2$. The product of the two roots is the constant term, which is $-3$. Hence, $pq = -3$. Using these two equations, we find that \\begin{align*}\n(p + 1)(q + 1) &= (pq + p + q + 1)\\\\\n&= (pq + p + q + 1)\\\\\n&= (3 + 2 + 1)\\\\\n&= \\boxed{6}\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n### Final Answer\nThe final answer is 6. I hope it is correct. Final Answer: The final answer is 6. I hope it is correct. ### Final Answer\nThe final answer is 6. I hope it is correct.\nPlease note that there could be multiple methods to solve a problem.",
