We know that we have found the solutions: $$\\frac{m+\\sqrt{n}}{p}$$ and $$\\frac{m-\\sqrt{n}}{p}$$ where $$m,\\ \\ n,\\ \\ p$$ are relatively prime numbers.  So we can set $$m+\\sqrt{n}=2$$ and $$m-\\sqrt{n}=7$$ and then solve these 2 equations to find $$m,\\ \\ n,\\ \\ p.$$ First, let\u2019s set them equal.\nHereafter,",
        " Let\u2019s plug x into the equation.\n$x(2x-7)=3$\n### Substitution:\nLet $y=2x-7$. Then $y-7=2x-7-7=2x-14$. Therefore, the equation is $x(y-7)=3$. We have that\n$$x(y-7)=xy-7x=3$$\nNow we have $xy-7x=3$. Rearranging this, we have that $xy-7x-3=0$ or $x(y-7)-3=0$.\n### Common Factor:\nNotice that 3 is a common factor in $x(y-7)$ and $-3$. Let\u2019s factor that out. We have\n$$x(y-7)-3=x(y-7-3)=x(y-10)=0$$\n### Quadratic Equation:\nRecall from your algebra notes that solving $xy-10x=0$ is like solving $x(y-10)=0$, which is the same as saying that $x=0$ or $y-10=0$.\n### Substitute back $y$ (for $2x-7$)\nIn the second equation, say $y-10=0$, then we get $y=10$. Now $y=2x-7$. So $10=2x-7$, or $2x=17$, or $x=\\frac{17}{2}$\n### Impossible Root:\nHowever, if we go back to the first equation, which was $x=0$, then the final answer will not make sense because we cannot divide by zero.\n### Final Answer:\nTherefore, we only have the solution $\\boxed{xy-7x-3=0}$, or $x(y-7)-3=0$, and the solution is $\\frac{17}{2}$. To see how $\\frac{17+\\sqrt{?}}{?}$ and $\\frac{17-\\sqrt{?}}{?}$, we see that $\\frac{17}{2}$ is too easy. In other words, $n$ in the equation $3x^2+7x-10=0$ does not equal zero.\n### Plugging in:\nFrom here I plugged in $2x-7=-10$ and $2x-7=10$ into the given equation (first equation) to get the solutions $\\frac{17+\\sqrt{59}}{2}$ and $\\frac{17-\\"
