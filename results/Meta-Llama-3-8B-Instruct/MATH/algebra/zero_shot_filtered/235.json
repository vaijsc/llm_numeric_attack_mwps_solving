        " Let\u2019s break down this problem into a few steps.\nThe key insight here is that each successive term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a constant. That means that for any two consecutive terms $a, b,$ we have $$b = ka$$ for some constant $k$. Since we\u2019re given values for $a = 243$ and $b = 81,$ we can determine this constant. We obtain: $$81=243\\cdot k\\Rightarrow k=\\frac{81}{243}=\\frac{1}{3}.$$Now that we know the value of $k,$ we can use it to find the value of $x.$ The term $x$ is one step after $y,$ and the term $y$ is one step after $81,$ so: $$x=81\\cdot\\frac{1}{3}=27.$$Using the same logic, we can find the value of $y$: $$y=27\\cdot \\frac{1}{3}=9.$$Therefore, we have $$x+y=27+9=\\boxed{36}.$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 36.

        " The first term is 243, which is $81^2$, and the second term is 81. That means the common ratio between each term is the square root of 243/81 = 3. So the third term is 81 * 3 = 243, and the next two terms are (243 / 3) and (243 / (3^2)) = 81 and 3. So, $x + y = 243$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 243. I hope it is correct.  we are trying to figure out the next two numbers in the sequence 243, 81, ? , ?, 3. If you look at the pattern so far, each number is 81 times the last number before it. So 81 = 243 divided by 3, and ? = 81 divided by 3, and ? = 81 divided by 3 again. That tells us that ? and ? are equal, and that ? = 27. So the sequence is 243, 81, 27, 27, 3. Therefore, x+y = 27 + 27 = 54. Another approach.\nThe first term is 243. Since it must be the square of some number (since it must be equal to x^2), we can say it is 81^2.\nSince the common ratio is a constant, it will also be applied to the next term (81). So 81 * sqrt(243/81) = 81 * 3 = 243.\nThen we will have 81 / sqrt(243/81) = 81 / 3 = 27.\nWe can continue this forever. Since 27 / sqrt(243/27) is 27 / 3 = 9, but we don't have 9 in the sequence let's stop.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 54. I hope it is correct.24\nTo find the value of $x + y$, we shall use the first two terms of the sequence, 243 and 81, to find the common ratio. We have that $243 = 81\\cdot 3$, so the common ratio is 3. We then have that $x = 81\\cdot 3 = 243$, and $y = 81\\cdot 3 = 243$, so $x + y = \\boxed{243}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 243.

Since $x$ is a fraction of 81, we try $x = 3$. Then, $y = \\sqrt{9}$ = 3, so $\\boxed{x + y = 3 + 3 = 6}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 6. I hope it is correct. Each successive term in the sequence 243, 81, x, y, 3,... is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a constant. What is the value of x+y? Let's think step by step. The pattern is: 243 -> 81 = \\frac{81}{243}; 81 -> x = \\frac{x}{81}; x -> y = \\frac{y}{x}; y -> 3 = \\frac{3}{y} Setting \\frac{y}{x} = \\frac{3}{y}, we get y^2 = 3x.
