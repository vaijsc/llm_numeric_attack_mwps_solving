        " Since 9 lags = 20 lugs, we can conclude that 1 lag = 20 / 9 lugs.\nIn the same way, since 7 ligs = 4 lags, we can conclude that 1 lig = 4 / 7 lags.\nSo, we have:\n### 1 lig = 4 / 7 lags, and 1 lag = 20 / 9 lugs. We need to find out how many lugs there are in 1 lig.\nWith the formula:\n(4 / 7 lags) \u00d7 (20 / 9 lugs/lag) = (80 / 63 lugs)\nThis means 1 lig is equal to 80 / 63 lugs.\n### If 1 lig = 80 / 63 lugs, then there are 80 / 63 \u00d7 x lugs in 1 lig. This gives us x = 63 lugs / 80 lugs. When we solve for x, x = 3/4, so we can conclude there are 3/4 lugs in 1 lig.\n### And what about how many ligs are equal to 80 lugs?\nIf there are 3/4 lugs per lig, then we can multiply 3/4 ligs into 80 lugs to solve this problem.\n3/4 ligs \u00d7 80 lugs = 60 lugs\n### But we need to find out how many ligs there are.\nWhen we divide 60 lugs by 3/4 lugs per lig, we get\n60 lugs / (3/4 lugs per lig) = 80 ligs\n### So, to summarize, 80 lugs is equal to 80 ligs. This is because of the proportion: 3/4 lugs per lig \u00d7 ? ligs = 80 lugs. And we solved for ? ligs to get 80 ligs.  \nVideo Link: [In 60 seconds with Khan Academy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5qakEQ4SLM&list=PLfWOwhRQu9JNf3VXgmiNO-iJPQrEnEdOB)\n!!! tip \"Pro-Tip\"\nThe way to convert between lags and lugs in this equation is by the unit conversion method of equivalent ratios.

        " 7 ligs = 4 lags, so we know that 1 lig = 4/7 lags.\n(7/4) lags = 1 lig \u2026 or 1 lig = 4/7 lags.\n9 lags = 20 lugs, so we know that 1 lag = 20/9 lugs.\n(20/9) lugs = 1 lag \u2026 or 1 lag = 20/9 lugs.\nNow, we can use these facts to find out how many ligs are equivalent to 80 lugs. Notice that we can get 7 ligs by multiplying both sides of the first equation by 7/4. That gives us:\n7/4 lags = 1 lig, and multiplying both sides by 7/4,\n(7/4) * 7/4 lags = (7/4) * 1 lig, so 49/16 lags = 7/4 lig.\nAnd notice that we can get 80 lugs by multiplying both sides of the third equation by 9/20. That gives us:\n80 lugs = 9/20 lags, and multiplying both sides by 9/20,\n(9/20) * 9/20 lugs = (9/20) * 9/20 lags, so 81/100 lags = 9/20 lags.\nFinally, we can use these two equations to find out how many ligs are equivalent to 80 lugs. Notice that we can get from 80 lugs to 81/100 lags, and then from 81/100 lags to 7/4 ligs. So, we can combine these steps to get:\n80 lugs = (9/20) * 9/20 lags, and then multiply both sides by 9/20,\n80 lugs = 9/20 lags. Then dividing both sides by 9/20,\n80 * (9/20) lugs = 1 lag. Then multiplying both sides by 7/4,\n80 * (9/20) * 7/4 lugs = 7/4 lig.\nAnd using the equation we found earlier, we have\n80 * (9/20) * (7/4) lugs = 7/4 lig. Then simplifying,\n36 ligs = 7/4 lig.

So, we can say 1 lug = (7 * (71 1/7)) / 20 ligs = 25 3/7 ligs.\nThat means, we can say the 7 ligs in an expression, 7 ligs = 4 lags, and 9 lags = 20 lugs have 25 3/7 ligs per 1 lug, in short.",

The ratio between ligs and lags is 7 ligs to 4 lags. Also, the ratio between lags and lugs is 9 lags to 20 lugs. The problem can be solved by converting the right side to ligs by multiplying 4 lags by 7 ligs. We know that 1 lag = 7/4 ligs. If 9 lags = 20 lugs, then dividing both sides by 9 lugs per lag, we find that 1 lag = 20/9 lugs. Combining these two equations, we find that 1 lag = 20/9 * 7/4 lugs = 70/36 ligs. Therefore, for every 1 lug you get [36/20 or 9/5] ligs. Therefore, for every [80] lugs we can get 1.8 x 80 = 144 ligs. This is equal to [1.8 x 80 = 144] ligs.",
