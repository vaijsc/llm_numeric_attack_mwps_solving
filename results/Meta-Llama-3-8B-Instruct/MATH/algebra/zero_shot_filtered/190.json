        " We know that $$(24x^2-19x-35)=(Ax-5)(2Bx+C),$$ where $A,B,C$ are positive numbers. First let's multiply both sides by $-1$ to get $$-24x^2+19x+35=A(-2Bx-C)(x-5)=-(Ax-5)(2Bx+C).$$ In order to find $A,B,C$, we will expand both sides of the equation: $$-(Ax-5)(2Bx+C)=A(-2Bx-C)(x-5).$$ If we just multiply the expressions on both sides, we obtain $$-2ABx^2+ACx+5Bx-5C=A(-2Bx^2-2BCx+Cx-5C)=A(-2Bx^2-Cx-5C).$$ Now we simply compare the coefficients of the terms: $$AB=A^2B=-2AB\\Rightarrow A=7.$$ Distributing $A$ gives us $$A(-2Bx-C)(x-5)=(7)(-2Bx-C)(x-5)=-14Bx^2-7Cx-35B.$$ By matching the coefficients, we get $$AC=7C\\Rightarrow C=5.$$ since $A$ and $C$ must be positive, and $$5B=35B\\Rightarrow B=7.$$ Thus $A=7,B=7,C=5$.

        " We are trying to write $24x^2-19x-35$ in the form $(Ax-5)(2Bx+C)$.

Since $A$ is negative, we must take the constant term of $(Ax-5)(2Bx+C)$ negative.  Also, since $A$ is negative and $2B+C$ is negative, then $2B$ must be positive.  This implies that $B$ is positive, and thus $AB$ and $2AB$ are positive, so $A$ is negative.  It is also given that $C$ is positive.\nIn our case, this becomes $24=2AB$ implies that $A=12$ and $B=3$ and $-19=2B+C$ implies that $C=\\boxed{11}$ and since we already know that $A$ is $-35$, we can easily do $AB-3C=(12)(3)-3(11)=\\boxed{9}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 9.

One thing to note is that you could have also used the original form to solve for $A$, $B$, and $C$, but you are correct that you need to take the constant term of the product to be negative, so you can assign the value $-35$ to $A$. Also, you correctly generalized that $A$ will be negative, so $AB$ and $2AB$ will be positive.\nOverall, I think you did an excellent job solving this problem, and your feedback is very detailed and thoughtful. Keep up the great work! ### Improvement suggestions\n- You could have also used the original form to solve for $A$, $B$, and $C$. This would",
        " Alright, let\u2019s start! First, we can multiply $(Ax-5)(2Bx+C)$ to see what we get:\n``(Ax-5)(2Bx+C) = A(2Bx^2)+C(Ax)-10Bx-5C\n  = 2ABx^2+AxC-10Bx-5C\n  = 2ABx^2+(AxC)-10Bx-5C\n``\nNow, we need to rewrite this as $24x^2-19x-35$. To match the terms, we need to equate coefficients:\n``2ABx^2 = 24x^2 ... A = 12  \\\\\n(Ax C) = -19x ... C = 19/12  \\\\\n-10Bx = -19x ... B = 10/12 = 5/3  \\\\\n-5C = -35 ... C = 19/12\n``\nSo now that we have our values, we can find $AB-3C$:\n``AB-3C = (12)(5/3)-3(19/12)\n  = 20-19/4\n  = 20-4.75\n  = 15.25\n``\nSo the final answer is $\\boxed{15.25}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 15.25.

        " So the expression can be written as $(Ax-5)(2Bx+C) = 2ABx^2+(5AC+2BC)x-5C$. Comparing coefficients of $x^2$ and $x$ and $a_0$, we have $AB=12$, $5AC+2BC=-19$ and $-5C=-35$.  From the last equation, $C=7$.  From the first equation, $A=\\frac{12}{B}$.  If we plug back in into the second equation, we have\n$$5(\\frac{12}{B})(C)+2BC=-19\\Rightarrow 60+2BC=-19\\Rightarrow 2BC=-79\\Rightarrow B=\\frac{-79}{2C}=\\frac{-79}{14}=\\boxed{-\\frac{79}{14}}.$$Finally, the value of $AB-3C$ is $$\\frac{12}{B}-3C = \\frac{12}{\\frac{-79}{14}}-3(7)=\\frac{12(-14)}{-79}-21=\\boxed{6}.$$",
        " The constant term comes from $5\\times C$.\n### A similar approach can be applied to extend this part, or we can know that always: The sum of coefficients of $x^2$ and $x$,or $\\mathbf{Ax^2(Bx+C)+Bx^2(Ax+)}$, is $\\mathbf{(A+B)AB^2}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 5. I hope it is correct.  Please let me know if you want me to delete 3 more space lines.",
