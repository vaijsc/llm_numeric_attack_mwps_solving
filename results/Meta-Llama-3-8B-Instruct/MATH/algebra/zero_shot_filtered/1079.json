        " $511$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 511. I hope it is correct. Let\u2019s break down $255^2 - 245^2$ by observing what we have.\nWe actually have $(255+245)(255-245)$, by the difference of squares formula. $255+245=500$ and $255-245=10$. So, $500\\times 10=5000$. It still looks a bit big.\nIf we rewrite the difference of squares formula $(x+y)(x-y)=x^2-y^2$. We can have a shortcut when we see that $x-y$ is actually a multiple of $10$.\nThen, $x^2-y^2=(x-y)(x+y)=10\\times 500=\\boxed{5100}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 5100. I hope it is correct. By working backwards from this constant value $5100$, let\u2019s find the remainder when $ vitamins4u \u2019s answer $\u2018 511 \u2019$ was given.\nClearly, their response $\u2018 511 \u2019$ cannot be the correct one. Let\u2019s try the reverse way. Actually, we should try all the values between $5100$ and $511$ in order to make sure which correct answer is.\nI assumed the answer is $5100$ is correct. However, if my answer was wrong, I will know what should do.\nSo, when other comments have the answer of $511$.\nIn those comments, they say the same thing as I: first, we have the difference of squares.\nThen, we have $(x+y)(x-y)=x^2-y^2$.\nBy using the difference of squares formula, we can write $255^2-245^2$ as $(255+245)(255-245)$. Then, we obtain $500\\times 10=5100$.\nBy thinking in this way, we knew that $5100$, $511$ are both incorrect.\nNow, let\u2019s find the correct answer!\nTo find $255^2-245^2$, we need to have $(x+y)(x-y)=(x-y)(x+y)$. It\u2019s because the halves of the $x$ and $y$ numbers come together to make a difference at the vertices.\nIn this case, we are looking for Area $=$ $255^2-245^2$.\nTo find that though area, we want to use the difference of squares formula $A",

After factoring, the product of the two expressions (255 + 245) and (255 - 245) was calculated. As a result, the problem was successfully solved. To ensure accurate answers, it's crucial to double-check calculations and verify the results. In this case, we can easily verify that the calculation is correct by plugging the values back into the equation: $255^2 - 245^2 = (500)(10) = 5000$. The value 5000 corresponds to the expression $255^2 - 245^2$, confirming that the calculation was accurate. Therefore, the answer is confirmed as 5000."
