        " When $x = 5$, and $y = 2$, we have\n$$\\sqrt{x^3 - 2^y}=\\sqrt{5^3-2^2}=\\sqrt{125-4}=\\sqrt{121}=11.$$\n### Explanation: If we think about the variables separately, we have $x^3=5^3=125$, and $2^2=4$. Then subtracting $4$ from $125$, we have $125 - 4 = 121,$ which is equal to $11^2$. And thus, we finally solve for $\\sqrt{125-4} = 11.$\n### Result:\nThe value of the expression $\\sqrt{x^3 - 2^y}$ when $x = 5$ and $y = 2$ is 11.\nThis answer may look a bit odd since there is no $x$ or $y$ in the final answer, but appreciate it for its simplicity. Indeed, the squares on both sides of the equation $x^2=121$ are identical, but when $x$ is taken to be the radical, the simplicity of 11 is unveiled, only to be re-absorbed once we know the answer.\n#### hai Duration 9:34 minsRead 1645 times\nFacebook Google LinkedIn Reddit Twitter See more responses Know the answer?

        "  $x = 5$ and $y = 2$.First of all, we need to find the value of $x^3$ which is $5^3 = 125$.We also know that, $2^y$ is $2^2$ which is 4. Now, we will subtract 4 from 125 to get $125 - 4 = 121$.Finally we will take the square root of 121 to get $\\boxed{11}$.\nWe could plug in our values for $x$ and $y$ into the expression $\\sqrt{x^3 - 2^y}$ to get $$\\sqrt{5^3 - 2^2} = \\sqrt{125 - 4} = \\sqrt{121} = \\boxed{11}.$$ This confirms that the solution is correct.\nSuppose we want to change this answer. We can change the expression. How? Let\u2019s take the square root of $x^3 + 2^y$ instead of $x^3 - 2^y$. Then we will get a different answer. For example, we will get $\\sqrt{x^3 + 2^2} = \\sqrt{5^3 + 4} = \\sqrt{125 + 4} = \\sqrt{129}$. So the new answer is $\\boxed{\\sqrt{129}}$.\n### Final Answer:\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 11. I hope it is correct.  Let\u2019s take the square root of $x^3 + 2^y$ instead of $x^3 - 2^y$. Then we will get a different answer. For example, we will get $\\sqrt{x^3 + 2^2} = \\sqrt{5^3 + 4} = \\sqrt{125 + 4} = \\sqrt{129}$. So the new answer is $\\boxed{\\sqrt{129}}$.  We could plug in our values for $x$ and $y$ into the expression $\\sqrt{x^3 - 2^y}$ to get $$\\sqrt{5^3 - 2^2} = \\sqrt{125 - 4} = \\sqrt{121} = \\boxed{11}.$$ This confirms that the solution is correct.

        " A positive value of the expression \\sqrt{x^3-2^y} \\text{when }x=5\\text{ and }y=2 is:\nWe know $x=5$, so:\n$\\sqrt{x^3 - 2^y} = \\sqrt{5^3 - 2^2} = \\sqrt{125 - 4} = \\sqrt{121} = \\boxed{11}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 11. I hope it is correct.  #### We have another way: In this problem, x = 5 and y = 2. x\u00b3 is given as 5\u00b3 = 125. 2^y = 2^2 = 4. 125 - 4 = 121. 121 = 11^2. Therefore, the final answer is also 11. I hope it is correct.  #### There\u2019s another approach. We need to evaluate \\sqrt{x^3 - 2^y}, given the values of x and y. x = 5 and y = 2 are given values, so we can put these values into the expression as follows: \\sqrt{x^3 - 2^y} is to be solved as follows: \\begin{align} \\sqrt{x^3 - 2^y} &= \\sqrt{5^3 - 2^2} \\\\ &= \\sqrt{125 - 4} \\\\ &= \\sqrt{121} \\\\ &= \\boxed{11} \\\\ \\end{align} The final answer is 11. I hope it is correct.  #### Let\u2019s re-write the problem using the variable $z$ and then solve: \\sqrt{x^3 - 2^y} I write the equation as z=\\sqrt{5^3-2^2} We get z=\\sqrt{125-4} or z=\\sqrt{121}. z=11. The answer is 11. I hope it is correct.  #### Another version: I write the expression as z = \\sqrt{x^3-2^y}. I then substitute the given values to get z=\\sqrt{5^3-2^2}. Then z=\\sqrt{125-4}. z=\\sqrt{121} = 11. I have solved the expression. Final answer: The final answer is 11. I hope it is correct.  #### Yet another way to do it: I think of the expression \\sqrt{x^3-",

        "\u00a0The first step is to plug $x = 5$ and $y = 2$ in place of $x$ and $y$, respectively.\nSo, we get $x^3 - 2^y = 5^3 - 2^2 \\Rightarrow \\sqrt{x^3 - 2^y} = \\sqrt{125-4} \\Rightarrow \\sqrt{x^3 - 2^y} = \\sqrt{121} \\Rightarrow \\sqrt{x^3 - 2^y} = 11.$\nBut we are asked for the positive value, so that value is $11$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 11.

Power of a power, denoted as $a^b$, is the cube of the expression $a$, $b$ is the inner factor, and $b$ is the exponent of $a$. Expressed in mathematical notation:\n$x^{a^b} = (x^{a})^{b} = x^{a \\cdot b}$\nThe ordered pair $\\left\\langle a, b \\right\\rangle = \\left\\langle 4, 2 \\right\\rangle$ where $a = 4$ and $b = 2$. Therefore, $x^{a^b} = x^{4^2} = x^{16}.$\n## Calculating Powers of Positive Exponents\nHere are some general rules and tips for calculating powers of positive exponents:\n1. **Power of a power formula**: For any positive integer $a$, $b$:\n$(a^b)^c = a^{bc}$\n2. **Power of a power example**: Simplify $(x^2)^3$:\n$(x^2)^3 = x^{2\\cdot 3} = x^6$\n3. **Power of a power example**: Simplify $(y^3)^4$:\n$(y^3)^4 =",

I think many students can benefit from this kind of example, and the approach is easy to follow. Would you like me to add anything to this example? For instance, an alternate approach to computing the value of the expression? Or something? I'm here to help! Let me know! \ud83d\ude0a\nMy two cents: I think one of the main takeaways here is emphasizing the importance of factorization and \"simplification techniques\" in solving expressions. This type of problem can be intimidating because it involves radicals, which sometimes seem mysterious, but as long as students can convert the problem into a simple expression and simplify, they can get to the answer easily! \ud83d\udc4d\nLet me know what you think! \ud83d\ude0a\nBest regards! \ud83d\udc4b\n[ Add this comment later when the editor is adding comments ]\n",
