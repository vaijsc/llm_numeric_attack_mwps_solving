        " 271\nWe begin by letting $y = 5$ because we are given that the expression equals 5.\nWe then have: $$\\sqrt{x + \\sqrt{x + \\sqrt{x + \\ldots}}} = 5$$or $$\\sqrt{x + y} = 5.$$\nSquaring both sides:\n$$x + y = 25$$\n$$x = 25 - y = 25 - 5 = \\boxed{20}$$\nIn other words, $$\\sqrt{x + \\sqrt{x + \\sqrt{x + \\ldots}}} = 5$$ if and only if $x = 20.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 20.
