Therefore, $f(0) + f(1) + f(2) = -1 + f(1) + f(2) = -1 + f(1) + (n^3 + 2n - 1)$. Note that $f(1) = 2$ and $f(2) = 9$, so $f(0) + f(1) + f(2) = -1 + 2 + 9 = 10$. In general, $f(0) + f(1) + f(2) = \\ldots = \\boxed{10}$.  It seems I have a simple and rather clumsy approach that does not generalise. I look forward to learning from other people's answers. \u2014 Neil Crafter (talk) 08:56, 25 August 2014 (UTC)\nIt is sometimes a risk of trying to generalise to take an overly complex approach. By keeping things simple and focusing on specific numbers rather than trying to find general formulas, we can actually achieve our goals more quickly and effectively. In this case, we only need to consider $f(0), f(1),$ and $f(2)$ because $f(0)$ and $f(1)$ have easier formulas and $f(n",
        " \nWe have $f(0) = 0 - 1 = -1$.  Now, $f(1) = (1)^3+2(1)-1 = 1$.  Finally, we have that $f(2) = (2)^3+2(2)-1 = 9$.  Putting all together we have $-1+1+9 = \\boxed{9}$.\n### Explanation: \nI used the definition of $f(n)$ to find $f(0)$, $f(1)$, and $f(2)$.  For example, I used $f(n) = n^3+2n-1$ when $n > 1$.  Plugging in $0$ or $1$ would not work because $0$ and $1$ are not greater than $1$.  So I used the other part of the definition, which is $f(n) = n-1$ when $n\\le 1$.

I hope it is correct. topping the instruction, the function f(n) is not the most complex and natural function. It seems unnecessary to use the specific value of n, looking at the step-by-step conclusion f(0) = -1, f (1) = 1, f (2) = 11, we can find that the function f(n) is a simple linear function f(n) = n ^ 3 + 2n - 1, but it is also a composition of three polynomials, each value plus 1 which 1, corresponding to n. For example, f(1) is f(1) = 1 ^ 3 + 2 * 1 - 1 = 1.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 11. I hope it is... more like the exact same as.

Then $m\\le n$ and $$n-1 < m\\le n,$$\nwhich means $$f(n)=n^3+2n-1 = (m+1)^3+2(m+1)-1.$$\nUsing the binomial expansion, we have $$(m+1)^3+2(m+1)-1 = m^3+3m^2+3m+1+2m+2-1 = m^3+3m^2+5m+1.$$\nSince $n$ is large, $m$ is also large and $m^3+3m^2+5m+1$ is very close to $m^3$.\nTherefore, $$f(n)=m^3+3m^2+5m+1 = m^3+\\theta(n).$$Step 2: Next, let $n$ be an integer and $n\\le 1$. In this case, $f(n)=n-1.$\nSince $f(n)$ is small and $\\floor{\\normalsize{n}}=0,$ we have $$f(n)=n-1=n-\\floor{\\normalsize{n}}+1 = \\floor",
