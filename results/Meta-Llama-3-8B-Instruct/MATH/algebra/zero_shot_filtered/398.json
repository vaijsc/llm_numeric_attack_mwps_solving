        " \nAssume the smallest integer is $j$. Then the integers are $j$, $j+1$, $j+2$, $j+3$, $j+4$, $j+5$, and $j+6$. The sum of these integers is $7j+21=49$.\nSince 28 is the only multiple of 7 between 21 and 42 that, when added to $7j$, gives us 49, we have that $7j+21=49$.

The remaining money 1/10 of the total scholarship; How much does the full scholarship all the money?\nSolution: Let S be the full amount of the scholarship. The recipient has paid 7S/10 of the full scholarship, which means there is 3S/10 remaining to be paid. This amount is 1/10 of the total scholarship. The amount to be paid is one-tenth of the total scholarship. To solve the problem, we create the equation:\n7S/10 + 3S/10 = S\nSimplifying this equation makes it:\n10S/10 = S\nSince 10S/10 equals S, the equation simplifies to 1S = S.

        " The smallest of the seven integers is x and the sum is 49. So we can write the equation 7x + 7(6)=49. Now, we simplify it: 7x + 42 = 49. Subtract 42 from both sides then we get 7x=7. Divide both sides by 7 then we get x=1.\r\n\r\nThe smallest of the seven integers is x which is 1.\r\n\r\nSo answer is 1.",
        " \nWe can set up the equation $x + (x+1) + (x+2) + (x+3) + (x+4) + (x+5) + (x+6) = 49,$ and solve for $x$:\n$$7x+21=49$$ $$7x=28$$ $$x=4$$\nSo the smallest of the seven integers is $\\boxed{4}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 4. I hope it is correct. ### Solution 2. Here we can try to work backwards.\nSince the seven integers are consecutive, their sum is an average of 7.  The average is the sum of 7 divided by 7.\n$$(7\\ \\mbox{numbers})\\cdot \\frac{49}{7}=49$$\nIf we divide this by 7, we get $$49/7=7$$\nWhat does this tell us?\nIt tells us that if the 4th number of the 7 numbers is 7, then each subsequent number (higher 3 numbers) will increase by 1, 2, 3, etc.  If each number increases by one more than the last, then the last number will be 7 + 6 = 13. If the last number is 13, the 2nd to last number will be 12, the one before that will be 11, etc. If we list all of the numbers from lowest to highest, they are 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11, but we know that is not the correct set of numbers since the first set of numbers is not listed.\nIf we pause and think for a moment, we should see that this is going backwards and that if we add the smallest number to 6, then we will get the right smallest number.  This approach is going backwards because we already know that each number increases by 1 more than the previous one so there is no need to continue to increase.  All we need to do is find a number to add.  That number is 4.\nThe answer given is 4 because the 7 numbers is obvious: they are the numbers from 4 to 10.  It is also correct because the average is 7 and there are 7 numbers.  To confirm this, just add all the numbers: $4+5+6+7+8+",

        " Let\u2019s start by writing an equation for the sum of 7 consecutive integers. Let a be the first integer. Then, a + (a + 1) + (a + 2) + (a + 3) + (a + 4) + (a + 5) + (a + 6) = 49. Simplify this equation by combining like terms. a + a + 1 + a + 2 + a + 3 + a + 4 + a + 5 + a + 6 = 49 a + 7a + 21 = 49 We can combine the a terms and then solve for a as follows: 7a + 21 = 49 7a = 28 a = 4\n### The smallest of the integers is a = 4.",

        " Since they are consecutive, we can define a variable and add each integer, trying to equate it to 49. The hardest part of this equation is deciding which way to go.

Then the 7 consecutive integers are n, n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4, n+5, and n+6.\nWe know that n + (n+1) + (n+2) + (n+3) + (n+4) + (n+5) + (n+6) = 49.",
