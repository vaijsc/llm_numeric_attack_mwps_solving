        "$$x^2+4x+5=a(x-h)^2+k$$$ We already have the left hand side; we have to get a\u2019s into standard form $(x-h)^2$.\nWe can accomplish this step simply by completing the square:\n$$x^2+4x+5$$$$=(x^2+4x+4)-4+5$$\n$$=(x+2)^2-4+5$$\nHence, we can conclude that $h=\\boxed{-2}$.\nMore Discussion: We can generalize this argument. $x^2+bx+c=a(x-h)^2+k$. Taking out $x^2$, the problem becomes equivalent to completing the square on the expression: $(x+b/2)^2+b^2/4+c-a(h-b/2)^2+k$. We can see the equality of both sides if $b^2/4+c=a(h-b/2)^2+k$. Solving this equation in terms of variables yields: $$c=a(h-b/2)^2+k+b^2/4.$$\nFinally, this indicates $h=b/2$. We used the quadratic expression $x^2+bx+c$, and then rearranged it by completing the square to conclude the quadratic expression was the same and showed that $h=b/2$ for a general quadratic formula.\nAnother way: Use constant factors to rewrite the expression and get it into standard form.\n$(x+2)^2$ is $x^2+4x+4$. Subtract 4 from the two sides. $x^2+4x+4-4=5$. So, $x^2+4x+5=(x+2)^2-4+5$. Or, $(x+2)^2+1$. $a=1$ and $h=-2$. Checks out: $(x-(-2))^2+1=x^2+4x+5$.\nI used another method because you wrote it as \u201ca\u2019s into standard form $(x-h)^2$\u201d https://www.mathopenref.com/alg-quadraticcomplete.html\nThe expression being completed is simple and contains no $y$; we check all three possible perfect squares to correct incorrect guesses, any $282$ https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most- elegant-method-to-complete-the-square-for-quadratic-functions\nAt the end, both sides are subtracted - 1.

By hand, this is a bit messy, which is why we might decide to factor it in the first place. \nAlternatively, notice that the $x^2$ term on the left corresponds to one squared factor; the $4x$ term corresponds to $2x$; and the $5$ corresponds to $(2)(h)$.

I hope it is correct. ### Explanation: Since the squared binomial is $x^2+4x+4$ and the rest is just a constant, we have $a=1$, $k=1$, and $h=-2.$  Therefore, $h=\\boxed{-2}.$ The given expression $x^2+4x+5$ is equivalent to $(x+2)^2+1$. The coefficient of the $x^2$ term is just $1$ and the constant term is $1$ as well, so the corresponding $a$ and $k$ values are $1$. Since the expression $(x+2)^2$ is a binomial squared, the value of $h$ is just the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola. So, $h=\\boxed{-2}$. Final Answer: The final answer is -2.

        " If we expand $(x - h)^2$, we have\n$$(x - h)^2 = x^2 - 2xh + h^2.$$\nNow let\u2019s compare the given expression $x^2 + 4x + 5$ and $(x - h)^2$.\nWe can see that the coefficient of the $x^2$ term is the same in both expressions. However, the coefficients of the $x$ term in both expressions are different. Specifically, $(x - h)^2$ would have $-2h$ as the coefficient of the $x$ term, while our given expression has a $4$.\nSo, by comparing the $x$ terms, we can set $-2h = 4$, which gives $\\boxed{h = -2}$.\n### Final Answer: The final answer is -2.

I am pleased.  ###### For a more realistic case, suppose that $x^2 + 4x + 5$ is in fact the equation of the graph of a curve that has vertex at $(-2, 3)$. If we can find the vertex, it would be the answer that we want.  ###### So, we need to identify the vertex of the parabola $x^2 + 4x + 5$.  To do so, we first complete the square to rewrite $x^2 + 4x + 5$ as $(x+2)^2 + 3$.  ###### Comparing the parabola $(x+2)^2 + 3$ to the general form $a(x-h)^2 + k$, we see that we have $a = 1$, $h = -2$, and $k = 3$. Therefore, the $h$-value of the parabola is $-2$, which is the answer that we want.  ###### This way of solving the problem goes a bit deeper than the first one.  It is interesting to see that we can go through multiple ways of solving the same problem. ###### If I were grading, I would give full credit to both ways of solving the problem.
