        " (Video Solution)\nThe graph of $y = ax^2+bx-6$ is completely below the $x$-axis. Since $y < 0$, we must have $ax^2+bx-6 < 0$. Since the parabola opens upward, we know that it is zero somewhere between $x=-\\infty$ and $x=+\\infty$. The two roots are therefore the solution to the equation $ax^2+bx-6=0$. By Vieta\u2019s, $ax^2+bx-6=(x-r_1)(x-r_2)=0$, so $r_1+r_2=-b/a$ and $r_1r_2=-6/a$.\nWe consider the quantity $r_1-r_2=-b^2/a^2+2\\sqrt{6/a}/a=-b^2/a^2-12/a$. Since $a^2=49$, this expression becomes\n$$r_1-r_2=-b^2/49-12/49.$$Since we have $a^2>0$, this expression is positive if and only if $b^2<12^2/49$. Since $49\\cdot1.5^2=108.75$, $b^2\\le 108/49$, so $b^2<12^2/49<36/49$, and hence $b\\le 6$.\nTherefore, the largest possible integral value of $b$ is $\\boxed{5}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 5.

        " \nThe $y$-coordinate is negative for all $x$, so the graph of the equation lies below the $x$-axis.\nNote that $ax^2+bx-6 < 0$.\nThis equation can be rewritten as\n$$ax^2+bx < 6.$$Therefore, we want to find the maximum value of $b$ such that the above equation is strictly less than zero (note that it doesn't need to be strictly positive) for all $x$. We can do this by solving the equation $ax^2+bx = 0$ using the quadratic formula. Now the quadratic formula for equation $ax^2+bx = 0$ is $$x=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}.$$And in this case, $$x=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2+24a}}{2a}.$$To make this equation zero we need to set the quantity under the radical sign equal to zero. In other words, set $\\sqrt{b^2+24a}=0$. Squaring both sides (note: that does not introduce extraneous solutions), we get $b^2+24a=0$, which gives $b^2=-24a$, and $a^2=49$ gives $49a=-24a$, and therefore $65a=0$, $a=0$, but that cannot be the case since if $a=0$ the equation $ax^2+bx-6=a(x^2+bx)-6$ will not have $x$-intercepts and the $x$-axis must always intersect the parabola.\nIn this problem the coefficient of $x^2$ is non zero. Therefore, the $x$-intercepts have the form $x=x_{1},x_{2}$. Therefore, $\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2+24a}}{2a}=x_{1}, x_{2}$. The square root cannot be zero. Therefore $a$ and $b$ are real numbers.\nIf $a=0$, then we know that $b$ must equal 0.\nUsing case 2 this shows that $b^2\\ne -24a$.\nSo lets use the quadratic equation:\nLet us consider the distance between $x_1$ and $x_2$ as a function of $a$ and $b$:\n$$x",
        " a) In particular, note that the vertex of the parabola must be below the $x$-axis, so it lies on the same side as the leftmost point of the parabola.

We write the equation $y=ax^2+bx-6$.\nYou find the equation $y=(x-2)(-a)+ax^2-6$ with the vertex $x=2$. So the vertex is negative. That is because $y<0$ together with the vertex and right of the vertex.\nThere is a line $y=0$ and there is $\\frac{1}{a(-a)}$  from the bottom. So $x = -b/2a$.

        " First, we can set $y=0$ to get rid of the minus in the equation.\n$$0=ax^2+bx-6$$\nRight now the graph is below the $x$-axis in all of $x$, so for each $x$, there are no points of the graph below the $x$-axis. So we must have that both sides of the equation are always negative. We can rewrite the equation to get: $$a(x^2+\\frac{b}{a}x-\\frac{6}{a})=0$$\n### Step 1: Sketching a graph\nWe know that the graph is completely below the $x$-axis, so $a$ and $-\\frac{b}{a}$ must have opposite signs. Note that $b$ is not equal to 0, which means that $-\\frac{b}{a}$ is an increasing/downright/upward slope, so $b>0$ and we have $a<0$.\nHence, we know that $$x^2+\\frac{b}{a}x-\\frac{6}{a}\\lt0$$\n### Step 2: Make the quadratic equation $$x^2+\\frac{b}{a}x-\\frac{6}{a}=(x+\\frac{b}{2a})^2-\\frac{b^2}{a^2}-\\frac{6}{a}\\lt0$$\nFirst, note that $(x+\\frac{b}{2a})^2\\ge0$. And if the inequality holds for all $x$, then $\\frac{b^2}{a^2}+\\frac{6}{a}\\ge0$\nNow, note that if $b$ has an odd integer value, $\\frac{b^2}{a^2}$ will have an even integer value. In the same way, if $b$ has an even integer value, $\\frac{b^2}{a^2}$ is the square of an integer. If we let $\\frac{b^2}{a^2}$ be the largest possible integer value, then we are allowed to test both an odd and even value of $b$ at the same time.\nLet $b$ equal the even integer value of $12$. We know that for all $x$, $$\\left(x+\\frac{12}{2(-49)}\\right)^2-\\frac{12^2}{(-49)}-\\frac{6}{(-49)}",
        " \nWe know that all the $y$-values are negative, so $ax^2+bx-6$ is always negative or zero, since we are not dealing with the $y$-intercept of -6.\nSo, $ax^2+bx-6<0$.  Furthermore, because $a^2=49$, this means that $a=\\pm 7$.\nIn addition, $a$ and $b$ can have any sign.\nHere\u2019s the magic step:\nThe largest possible value of $b$ occurs when the coefficient of $x^2$ is at its largest positive value, extreme case. Now, we see that if we make $a=7$, we will have a larger $b$ than if $a=-7$ (We want the signal of $b$ equalizing the signal of $a$ as much as possible so that the denominator gets canceled more, and hence increases the signal of $b$). Note that a signal of a quantity means a positive value or a negative value, depending on the context.\nHowever, we can only have either a positive or negative $b$ (we don't want to have the denominators of $b$ becoming less than 0). \nNow we consider a positive $b$. For $a=7$, a positive $b$ will make the coefficient of $x$ more prominent, which makes the denominator (in the sign of $b$) cancel with $a$ as much as possible since we want to make them equal in sign).\nHowever, this gives us an aspect of the extreme case, yet we have \nto note that $b<0$ also makes sense as our optimally extreme case, especially considering that $a>0$, and hence a larger $b$  exists if both signs are the same.  In other words, since $a$ is positive, we are expecting a positive $b$, but the extreme case arises when the denominator (signal of $b$) is canceled with $a$ properly.\nSo then $b=-14$. So the maximum value of $b$ is $b=\\boxed{-14}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -14. I hope it is correct. \nWe have to remember the sign of the extreme case based on our auto constraint like the denominator cannot be less than zero.\nI hope it helps.  Let me know if you have any feedback. \nFinal Answer: The final answer is -14. I hope it is",

Since $y = ax^2 + bx - 6$ is completely below the $x$-axis, its minimum $y$-value is $-6.$  Since we know that this minimum value occurs when the derivative of that graph is 0, and the derivative is given by $f'(x) = 2ax + b,$ we know the critical values of that function must satisfy $2ax + b = 0.$ Since this is a quadratic function and we have its vertex and a point below it, we can solve for the vertex by manipulating the equation to get an expression of the form $y = a(x-h)^2+k$ and then find the coefficient $a$, the $x$-coordinate of the vertex, and the $y$-coordinate of the vertex. By multiplying $f'(x) = 2ax + b$ by $-\\frac{1}{2a},$ we can isolate the quadratic function. Let $f(x) = ax^2 + bx - 6.$ Then we have that $\\begin{array}{rll}2ax + b &= 0\\\\-\\frac{2ax + b}{2a} &= 0\\\\-\\frac{b}{2a} + x &= 0\\\\\\Rightarrow -\\frac{b}{2a} &= -x\\\\x &= \\frac{b}{-2a}\\end{array}$ But, we know that this is the vertex.

        " We know that the graph of the equation $y=ax^2+bx-6$ is completely below the $x$-axis. Therefore, the equation $ax^2+bx-6$ must be negative for all values of $x$.\nThe function $ax^2+bx-6$ is negative for all values of $x$, and we know that the equation $ax^2+bx-6=0$ will have at least one positive root, because $a\\neq0$ and $a^2=49>0$. Therefore, this equation has a pair of complex conjugate roots.\nThus, we need to find the largest possible value of $b$ which ensures that all roots of the equation are real and negative.\n### Let's pause and think:\nFrom Vieta's formulas, if $a_1,a_2$ are the roots of the equation. We have  $a=a_1a_2$, $(b)=a_1+a_2$ and $-6=a_1a_2+b(a_1+a_2)+-6=-a_1a_2$ because - a is negative for all x (as mentioned above). Therefore, $a_1a_2=-6$\nSince all roots are negative  $a_1a_2=-6 \\rightarrow a_1,a_2\\in \\boxed{(-\\infty,0)}$ and since $a^2=49$ and there is no $x$  value s.t a (x)=0 (because all roots are negative), we can define $a_1=-\\sqrt{a}$ and $a_2=-\\sqrt{a}$ (Then a_1a_2= a =49 analytically).\n### Now, we shall continue from the main response:\nFrom the above we have: $a_1=-\\sqrt{49}=-7$ and $a_2=-\\sqrt{49}=-7$. Then, $a_1+a_2=-7-7=-14$ and $-6=a_1a_2=49\\rightarrow a_1a_2=-6$\nPlugging this into $ax^2+bx-6=a(x-7)(x+7)=0$ this quadratic has two real negattive roots $\\boxed{-7,7}$.\nSo, $-14=b$ and the largest possible integral value of $b$ is $\\boxed{-14",
        " \nLet\u2019s first recognize that, since the graph of $y=ax^2+bx-6$ is completely below the $x$-axis, then it is a parabola opening upwards with a vertex at or below the $x$-axis.  Since we know the vertex is at or below the $x$-axis, we know that $ax^2+bx-6$ is always above the $x$-axis, which is a contradiction, so we know that the vertex must be at the $x$-axis.  Since the parabola opens upwards at the vertex, we know the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is a maximum value on the parabola.  To find the equation of the parabola, we know the vertex is at the point $(x,0)$, where $0=ax^2+bx-6$.  Since we also know $a^2=49$, we can write $0=ax^2+bx-6$ as:\n\\begin{align*}\n0&=49x^2+7bx-6\\\\\n&=49\\left(x^2+\\frac{7b}{49}x-\\frac{6}{49}\\right).\n\\end{align*}\nLet $x_0$ be the $x$-coordinate of the vertex (the $x$-coordinate of the maximum value on the parabola), then\n$$x_0=\\frac{-\\frac{7b}{49}}{2\\cdot 49}=\\frac{-b}{98}.$$Using the vertex form $y=a(x-x_0)^2$, we have\n$$y=49x^2+7bx-6=49(x-x_0)^2.$$Therefore,\n$$6=49(x-x_0)^2\\Rightarrow 6=49\\left(x-\\frac{b}{98}\\right)^2.$$Since the graph is completely below the $x$-axis, the vertex is a maximum value on the parabola, so $x_0=-\\frac{b}{98}$ is less than any other $x$ value. Thus, we know $-\\frac{b}{98}$ is the smallest value $x$ can ever attain for the graph of $y=49(x-\\frac{b}{98})^2$ to be completely below the $x$-axis.  Since the parabola is completely below the $x$-axis,",
        " The largest possible integral value of b is \\boxed{12}  First, the parabola has to open downwards, so a is negative. This is because there are two $x$-values where $y$ is at its max, and these two $x$-values must be symmetric around the vertex. Since the $y$-values are negative everywhere, these two $x$-values must also be less than the $x$-value of the vertex. Only if a is negative does this work. Next, we know that $a^2=49$, so $a=\\pm 7$. The parabola opens downwards if $a$ is negative, so we choose the minus value. We need that the parabola is completely below the $x$-axis, so the vertex, which is the lowest point, must have a $y$-coordinate of -6. This means that\n\\begin{align*} ax^2+bx-6&=-6\\\\\n-a(x^2-\\frac{b}{a}x+\\frac{6}{a})&=0\\\\\n-a(x-\\frac{b}{2a})^2+\\frac{6b-6a^2}{4a}&=0\\\\\n(x-\\frac{b}{2a})^2<\\frac{6a^2-6b}{4a^2}<0 \\end{align*} if and only if $\\frac{6a^2-6b}{4a^2}<0$. Let $d=6a^2-6b$. Then, $d=-\\frac{db}{2a}$ by our previous work, and so the parabola is below the $x$-axis exactly when $d$ and $\\frac{db}{2a}$ are negative and positive, respectively. This happens when $d$ and $\\frac{db}{2a}$ have opposite signs. Notice that, since $d=6a^2-6b$ and $d=-\\frac{db}{2a}$, they have opposite signs if and only if $d>0$. Then, we know that the maximum of $d$ occurs when $b$ is as small as possible, since that increases the positive part of our expression. By the extreme values theorem, the maximum of $d$ occurs at some point $b$ and that point satisfies $\\frac{d}{db}=0$, so $\\frac{",
        "  Since $y \\le 0$ for all $x$, we have $ax^2 + bx - 6 \\le 0$ for all $x$.  The graph is completely below the $x$-axis, so there are no solutions to this inequality other than the ones when $x$ is undefined (i.e., when the discriminant is negative).  Therefore, we want\n$$b^2 - 4a(6) \\le 0.$$Breaking this inequality into a compound inequality, we have\n$$b^2 \\le 4a(6) \\Rightarrow b^2 \\le 4 \\cdot 49 \\cdot 6 = 1176 \\Rightarrow |b| \\le \\sqrt{1176}.$$Since the largest possible integral value of $b$ is the largest value that is at most $\\sqrt{1176}$, we must find the largest integer whose square is at most 1176.  Doing this, we find that the largest such value is $\\boxed{34}$.Final Answer: The final answer is 34. I hope it is correct.  There may be a faster way to calculate this, but we can get a rough estimate of what $b$ should be by setting $x = 0$.  Since we know that $y = -6$ when $x=0$, we have $-6 = a(0)^2 + 0b - 6 =-6 \\Rightarrow 0=0$, so this is true. Next, we could set $x = -3$, and solve for $y$.\n\\begin{align*}\n-3 & = a(-3)^2 + b(-3) - 6 \\\\\n-3 & = 9a - 3b-6 \\\\\n3 & = 3b - 9a \\\\\n-3 & = 9a - 3b \\\\\nb & = 3 + 3a \\\\\n\\end{align*}This gives us a very rough estimate for $b$, but as long as $a^2 = 49$, then the absolute value of $b$ will be at least $\\sqrt{1176}$.\nMost times, each day, Diksha studies only the mathematics books that yearns to learn them.  His tutors she turns into up.   When I lecture, this adds a different perspective.  Someone can the new and read, he already has them, the math so with ease.  Reading",
        " 1\nAt first, we notice that the graph is always below the $x$-axis, so it implies that the quadratic equation $y=ax^2+bx-6$ has no real positive roots. To find the largest $b$ possible, we will set the quadratic equation equal to zero and find the largest possible value of $b$.\\\\ It is essential to note that a quadratic equation of the form $y=ax^2+bx+c$ has a real root at $-\\frac{b}{2a}$ if $b^2-4ac\\le 0$ (Therefore, let\u2019s set $b^2-4ac\\le 0$): $$\\begin{align*} &b^2-4ac\\le 0\\\\ &\\Rightarrow\\qquad -(4a)c\\le b^2\\end{align*}$$ In order to satisfy the above equation, we must have $c>0$ or $c<0$. If $c>0$, then $-4ac$ will be positive, violating the above equation. Therefore, we consider the case when $c<0$: $$\\begin{align*} &-(4a)c\\le b^2\\\\ &\\Rightarrow\\qquad4ac\\ge-b^2\\\\ &\\Rightarrow\\qquad |4ac|\\ge |b^2|\\end{align*}$$ $$\\begin{align*} &|4ac|\\ge |b^2|\\end{align*}$$ Therefore, the absolute value of the left side of the equation must be greater than or equal to the absolute value of the right side. Let us denote the right side as the initial function.\\\\ We are trying to maximize the absolute value of the left side. If we multiply the left side by $-1$ then it serves the opposite function. $$\\begin{align*} &-(4ac)\\ge |b^2|\\end{align*}$$ $$\\begin{align*} &\\Rightarrow\\qquad 4ac\\le -|b^2|\\end{align*}$$ Now we can now simplify our initial equation: $$\\begin{align*} &|4ac|\\ge |b^2|\\end{align*}$$ $$\\begin{align*} &\\Rightarrow\\qquad 4ac\\le -|b^2|\\end{align*}$$ By adding $|b^2|$ to both sides"
