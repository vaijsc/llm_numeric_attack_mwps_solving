This would make the language more precise and formal. Overall, your response is excellent, and I'm confident you'll do well on this assessment. Keep up the great work!",

I hope it is correct.\u00a0\u00a0### Explanation: The given function $f(x) = \\sqrt{3x} + 2$ is equal to 2 when $x$ is equal to 0, and it is equal to 5 when $x$ is equal to 3. Therefore, $f(0) + f(3)$ is equal to 2 + 5 = 7. 7 is the correct answer. I hope you have understood how to evaluate the value of $f(0) + f(3)$ by considering the function $f(x) = \\sqrt{3x} + 2$ at certain points.
