        " The question is about finding the required y-coordinate of the point on the line m that has x-coordinate 6. To solve this, we need to find the equation of the line m that is perpendicular to the line l at (2,1). The given line l is y = 4x - 7, and its slope is 4. The slope of any line perpendicular to this line is its negative reciprocal, i.e., -1/4. Since the line m is perpendicular to the line l at (2,1), we can find its equation using the point-slope form of a line: y - y1 = m(x - x1). The required slope of the line m is -1/4, and its point of intersection is (2,1). So, the equation of the line m is y - 1 = -1/4(x - 2). Now we can simplify this equation by distributing -1/4 and then subtract 1 from both sides: y = (-1/4)x + 5/4. This is the equation of the line m. Now we are given the problem that point (6,y) is a point on this line. That means, we can replace the x with 6 in the equation: y = (-1/4)(6) + 5/4. Simplifying further, we get y = -3/2 + 5/4. The given question asks for the y-coordinate of the point, so we simply take the value of y, which is -3/2 + 5/4. This can be simplified further to y = 1/4. So, the y-coordinate of the point on the line m that has x-coordinate 6 is 1/4.\n### Example: We are asked to write all values that x must be greater than. We can do this by using the fact that there is a y-coordinate. We know that (2,1) is a point on both line l and line m. The line l has equation y = 4x - 7. If we substitute x = 2, y = 4x - 7 = 4(2) - 7 = 6 - 7 = -1. So, (2,1) cannot be on line l. (2,1) is on line m, and line m is perpendicular to line l at 2. So, line m is not perpendicular to line m. So, line m",

Errors can be seen as variations, and given the complexity of the Information, variations are difficult to avoid.

The solution incorporates a step-by-step approach to solve the problem by first getting information about line $l$ and line $m$ and then using the initial condition to find the value of the $y$-coordinate.
