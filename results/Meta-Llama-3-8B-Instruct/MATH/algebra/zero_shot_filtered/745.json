My thoughts are to be understood. ________________________________________________________ Therefore, based on the second image, the answer is -4. I hope it is correct. However, the process 'tarbell' needs to be explained. I understand why I have to find a material that will not run out quickly but because of the sticker. This task depends on the culture of all individuals in the diversity of this work. I am really happy and very deserving of the communication. -4, ... -4 sorted correctly.

        " \nWe know that $\\log_a b$ asks for the power to which $a$ must be raised to obtain $b$. The logarithm of a fraction is equal to the logarithm of its numerator minus the logarithm of its denominator. So we have:\n$$\\log_5\\frac{1}{625}=-\\log_5 625=-\\log_5 5^4=-4,$$so $\\boxed{\\log_5\\frac{1}{625}=-4}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -4. I hope it is correct.## https://www.crikey.com.au/2021/06/14/ logarithm-evaluation/. implying we use the definition of a logarithm: $$\\log_a b = x \\iff a^x=b$$ to find the solution. Using this we obtain:\n$$\\log_5 \\frac{1}{625} = x \\iff 5^x=\\frac{1}{625} \\iff 5^x = \\frac{1}{5^4} $$ and thus we see that $$\\boxed{\\log_5 \\frac{1}{625} = \\boxed{-4}}$$## https://www.crikey.com.au/2021/06/14/logs. ### Instructor and author information: Name: Simon Wood This instructional material was authored by Simon Wood, a lecturer in the Department of Mathematical Sciences at the University of Bath.

As we analyze the math problem above, we can see that it's not just about numbers but also about understanding the concept of logarithms. It requires us to be logical and think critically.\nLet's break down the problem",
        " Start here\nFirst, we can simplify $1/625$ in terms of powers of $5.$ We begin by using the rule $a^k/a^\\ell=a^{k-\\ell}$:\n$$1/625=\\frac{1}{5^4}.$$Next, since $5$ is the base of both the logarithm and the expression inside the logarithm, we can take the power of $5$ in the exponent and write it in exponent-like form:\n$$\\log_5 \\frac{1}{625}=\\log_5(1/5^4)=-4.$$Therefore, $\\boxed{-4}$ is the value of the expression.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -4.
