        " We are given two points on the line, $B(7,-1)$ and $C(-1,7)$. We are asked to find the slope $m$ and $y$-intercept $b$. Since the point slope form of the line in terms of the slope $m$ is $y-m(x-x_1)=y_m-x_1$, we can use the point $(7,-1)$ to find the slope $m$: $m=\\frac{-1-(y_m-7)}{7-7}=\\frac{-1-y_m}{0}$, and since division by zero is undefined, we are going to use $y=y_m$ instead of $y_m-x_1$. Thus, $m=\\frac{-1-y_m}{0}$ becomes $m(-7)+y_m=-1$. Thus, we can choose $-1+y_m=m(-7)$, which gives $y_m=m\\cdot7+1$. Let\u2019s use the point $C(-1,7)$ now.
