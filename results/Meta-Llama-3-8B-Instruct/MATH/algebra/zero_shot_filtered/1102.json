Expanding the right-hand term of the equation (1), we get \n(x+m)^2-63=x^2+2mx+m^2-63 (x+m)^2=x^2+2mx+m^2\nEquating the coefficients of similar terms, we get \n2m=b, m^2-63=1 ...or...(m+9)(m-7)=0\nAs per the condition given, m is positive.

        " To rewrite the quadratic $x^2+bx+1$ in the form $(x+m)^2-63$, we must have that\n$$x^2+bx+1 = (x+m)^2-63 = x^2+2mx+m^2-63.$$ Equating like coefficients, we see that $2m=b$ and $m^2-63=1$.

That is, $(n^2)^2=n^4,$ and $(n^2)^3=n^6,$ etc. Similarly, squaring a negative number also preserves the sign, so its square is positive, its fourth power is negative, its sixth power is positive, etc.\nTopics:\u00a0\u2022 completing the square \u2022 quadratic equations \u2022 algebra\nConcepts:\u00a0\u2022 algebra \u2022 quadratic equation \u2022 completing the square\n525 views\n### ",

        " First let\u2019s start with the quadratic function x^2+bx+1.\nWe are given that it can be written in the form (x+m)^2-63. We can start by rewriting the first term (x+m)^2 using a square identity: (x+m)^2 = (x+m)(x+m) = (x^2+mx+m^2). Now, we know that x^2+bx+1 is equal to (x^2+mx+m^2)-63, so we can set these two expressions equal to each other and solve for m and b.\n$x^2+bx+1 = (x^2+mx+m^2)-63$\nSince the two polynomials are equal, we can set their like terms equal to each other. So, we have:\nx^2 + bx + 1 = x^2 + mx + m^2 - 63\nWe can subtract x^2 from both sides to get:\nbx + 1 = mx + m^2 - 63\nNext, we can subtract m^2 from both sides to get:\nbx + 1 - m^2 = mx\nNow, we can subtract bx from both sides to get:\n1 - m^2 = mx - bx\nNext, we can add m^2 to both sides to get:\n1 = mx + m^2 - bx - m^2\nThis simplifies to:\n1 = mx - bx\nNow, we can add bx to both sides to get:\n1 + bx = mx\nFinally, we can subtract mx from both sides to get:\n1 + bx - mx = 0\nThis can also be written as:\nx(b - m) + 1 = 0\nThis is a linear equation in the variable x. We are given that this equation is the quadratic function x^2+bx+1. This means that 1 + bx - mx = 0 is equal to 0, so we know that b - m = 0. We can rewrite this as m = b.\nSo, we have determined that m = b. We can use this result to determine that if we substitute m = b into our first equation, we will have x^2 + bx + 1 = (x+b)^2 - 63.\nThis gives us the equation x^2 + bx + 1 = (x+b)^2 - 63. We can simplify this by distributing the 1 in the first term:\nx",
        " Firstly, we need to find the value for $m$.\nWe can easily do that by solving $x^2+bx+1=(x+m)^2-63$.\nWe can do so by rearranging the terms to get a common quadratic form: $$x^2+bx+1=(x+m)^2-63$$\nThen we can expand the right-hand side and simplify:\n$$x^2+bx+1=x^2+2mx+m^2-63$$\nNow we can compare both sides, which gives us:$$bx+2mx=m^2-63$$To get rid of $x$, we can subtract $mx$ on both sides. $$bx+2mx-mx=m^2-63-mx$$And now we have a nice equation. Simplifying gives:$$bx=m^2-63-mx$$\n Now we can set $x=0$. $$b=m^2-63-m\\cdot0$$This gives us the following: $$b=m^2-63$$\nAnd we need to solve for $m$:\n$$m^2-63=b$$We can do this by first factoring:\n$$m^2-63=b$$\nThen we subtract $b$ and add 1 on both sides. $$m^2-63-b+1=0$$$$m^2-(b+1)=0$$And we can now solve for $m$ using the quadratic formula: $$m=\\pm\\sqrt{(b+1)}$$Now we need to find the value of $b$:\n$$b=m^2-63$$\nPlugging in the expression for $m$ we get:$$b=(\\pm\\sqrt{(b+1)}))^2-63$$\nBy squaring we get:$$b=b+1-63$$$$b-1=-63$$Finally, we add $1$ to both sides to get:$$b\\boxed{=62}$$\nAnd that is the value of $b$ that we need:$$b=62$$",

        " Let the quadratic be $x^2+bx+1$. Masha completes the square. That\u2019s equivalent to saying that\n$$(x^2+bx+1)+(\\cdots)=\\left(x+\\left(\\frac{b}{2}\\right)\\right)^2-63$$The first step is to take $x^2+bx+1$ and add $1/4b^2$ to both sides. This makes $$(x^2+bx+1)+(\\cdots)=x^2+\\frac{b^2}{4}+bx+\\frac{b^2}{4}+1.$$Remember that when we add $1/4b^2$ to $x^2+bx+1$, we\u2019re essentially adding a perfect square of $b$ to $x^2$.\nNow, we have what we want to put inside parentheses. What we can do now is make it into a perfect square again. We get $$(x^2+bx+1)+(\\cdots)=(x+b/2)^2.$$The next step is to find what we have to subtract from the numerator. From $(x+b/2)^2$, we have $x^2+b^2/4+bx$. The way we got here was we added $b^2/4$ to make the square, so we have to subtract it again. That gives us $$(x+b/2)^2-\\frac{b^2}{4}=\\boxed{\\left(x+\\frac{b}{2}\\right)^2-\\frac{b^2}{4}}.$$This is what we were trying to get. The last step is to find what $63$ is. If we now look at $$(x+b/2)^2-\\frac{b^2}{4}-1,$$it looks pretty familiar. It looks like we can rewrite this as $x^2+bx+(\\cdots)$, which tells us that if we square the binomial, and rewrite $b^2/4$ as $\\cdots$, then we should end up with $x^2+bx+1$. Wait, didn\u2019t we just do this in step one? We took $x^2+bx+1$ and turned it into $(x+b/2)^2-63$. This means that $63$ and $\\cdots$ add up to $1$. Therefore, we should set $\\cdots$ to $-1/4$.",

        " We use completing the square:\n\\begin{align*}\nx^2+bx+1&=(x+m)^2-63\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x^2+bx+1&=(x+m)^2-9(7).\n\\end{align*} Since this is a perfect square, we can expand on the right-hand side:\n\\begin{align*}\nx^2+bx+1&=x^2+2mx+m^2-9(7)\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad bx+1&=2mx+m^2-63\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad b&=2m\\\\\n\\text{and}\\qquad 1&=m^2-63\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad m&=8\n\\end{align*} Therefore, $b=2(8)=\\boxed{16}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 16.

        " Using the formula $a(x - p)^2 + q = a(x^2 - 2px + p^2) + q = ax^2 - 2apx + ap^2 + q$, we have \\begin{align*}\nx^2 + bx + 1 &= (x + m)^2 - 63 \\\\\n&= x^2 + 2mx + m^2 - 63.\n\\end{align*} Equating the coefficients of $x$ (multiply both sides by 1), we have $b = 2m$.\n### Next part: Now we have a system of equations to solve, namely\n$$b=2m,\\qquad m^2-63=1.$$Rearranging the second equation yields $m^2=64$, so $m=\\pm 8$. Since the problem states that $b$ is positive, we have to take $m=8$, and then $b=\\boxed{16}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 16. I hope it is correct.  ### Alternative Solution: Notice that $x^2+bx+1$ is always nonnegative. But for $x^2+bx+1$, the $y$-coordinate of its vertex is $-\\frac{1}{4}b^2+1$. Since in $(x+m)^2-63$, the $y$-coordinate of its vertex is $m^2-63$, we have $m^2-63\\ge -\\frac{1}{4}b^2+1$. This implies $m^2\\ge -\\frac{1}{4}b^2+64$, and using $b=2m$ yields $m^2\\ge -\\frac{1}{2}b+64$, or $\\frac{3}{2}b\\le m^2+64$. Also, notice that the vertex of $x^2+bx+1$ lies above the $x$-axis, so $-\\frac{1}{4}b^2+1\\ge 0$, or $\\frac{1}{4}b^2\\le 1$, or $\\pm b\\le 2$, so $b$ is positive. Therefore, we have $m^2\\ge 64$, or $m\\ge 8$. Plugging this back into $b=2m$, we have $b=2\\cdot 8"
