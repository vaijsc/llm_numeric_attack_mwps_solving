        " First we have a^3, what does this mean?\nFor a variable, a^3 is shorthand for the result of multiplying a by itself three times, or a * a * a (just 3 times). For example with a = 5, a^3 means 5 * 5 * 5 = 125.\n### ",
        " \nWe need to evaluate the expression $a^3 \\cdot a^2$.  We know that $a=5$, so we can substitute that in:\n$$a^3 \\cdot a^2 = (5)^3 \\cdot (5)^2 = 125 \\cdot 25 = \\boxed{3,125}.$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 3,125. I hope it is correct. If you want to know other solutions manually, you can find them here. Because of the nature of exponential variables, any value of an exponential expression can be calculated by raising any number to that power and then multiplying them. This is known as the Law of Exponentials. This law can help Calculators do exponentiation quickly. We are only focusing on finding one solution here. To know about laws of exponents more in detail.

        " Final Answer: The final answer is 5^5=3125. I hope it is correct. 5 )\nStep 1: Multiply the exponents (the superscript number).\na^3 \\cdot a^2 = a^{3 + 2}\nSo, the expression is 5^(3 + 2). 3 + 2 = 5.\nStep 2: Plug in the value of a.\n5^5\nSo, the final answer is 5^5 = 3125. #### Related Problems: ",
