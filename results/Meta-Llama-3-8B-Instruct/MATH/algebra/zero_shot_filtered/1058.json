    "solution": "Let $x$ be the number of blue marbles and $y$ the number of yellow marbles before I added more. We are given that the ratio of blue to yellow is 4:3, so $\\dfrac{x}{y}=\\dfrac{4}{3}$. Additionally, after we add blue marbles and remove yellow marbles the total number of blue marbles and yellow marbles will be x+5 and y-3 respectively. We're given that at this point the ratio will be $7:3$, so $\\dfrac{x+5}{y-3}=\\dfrac{7}{3}$. Cross multiplying the first equation gives $3x=4y$ and cross multiplying the second gives $3(x+5)=7(y-3)$. Solving two linear equations on two variables is routine; we get the solution $y=12$, $x=16$. Since $x$ represents the number of blue marbles before more were added, the answer to the problem is just $\\boxed{16}$.",

        " I love a good ratio problem! Let\u2019s start by using the initial ratio of 4:3. Since the ratio is 4:3, for every 4 blue marbles, there are 3 yellow marbles.

So the new ratio of blue to yellow marbles is 7:3. New relationship: (b+5)/(y-3) = 7/3.\n### Step 4: We write an equation to match this relationship. 3(b+5) = 7(y-3).\n### Step 5: Now we can replace b with the expression from Step 2. 3(4/3*y + 5) = 7(y-3).\n### Step 6: Go ahead and simplify: 4y + 15 = 7y - 21.\n### Step 7: Simplify again, and you get: 3y = 36.\n### Step 8: Now solve for y. y = 12.\n### Step 9: Now we have the number of yellow marbles. To find number of blue marbles, replace y in the expression from Step 2.\n### Step 10: So we have b = 4/3*y. b = 4/3*12 = 4*4 = 16. So, there were 16 blue marbles in the bag before additional marbles were added.\n### Answer: The correct answer is 16. ### Step 11: Now you can summarize. Initially, there were 16 blue marbles, and 12 yellow marbles, creating a ratio of 4:3. With 5 blue marbles added and 3 yellow marbles removed, the ratio became 7:3. Voila! ### How did you do?

        " To make the problems easier, it is often helpful to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators in the ratio, and use that as the total number of marbles. Here, the ratio starts as 4:3, so we calculate the LCM of 4 and 3, which is 12. So the total number of marbles is initially 12. The ratio of blue to yellow is 4:3, so the number of blue marbles is 4/7 * 12 = 16/7 and the number of yellow marbles is 12 - 16/7 = 8/7.\nNow we are told that after adding 5 blue marbles and removing 3 yellow marbles, the ratio of blue to yellow becomes 7:3. We have just removed 3 yellow marbles, so there are now 8/7 - 3 = 5/7 yellow marbles.\nThe ratio of blue to yellow is now 7:3, so there are 7/10 * (16/7 + 5) = 11 blue marbles after adding and removing the marbles. We added 5 blue marbles, so there must have been 11 - 5 = 6 blue marbles initially.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 6. I hope it is correct.",
        " 61\nThe ratio of blue to yellow is 4:3. So we can say that the original number of blue marbles is $4x$ and the number of yellow marbles is $3x$. Then we add 5 blue marbles and obtain a total of $4x+5$. We remove 3 yellow marbles, so we subtract 3 to obtain a total of $3x-3$. The ratio is 7:3, so the new ratio is 7:3. This gives us\n$$\\frac{4x+5}{3x-3}=\\frac{7}{3}$$\nCross multiplying, we get\n$$4x+5=7x-7$$\nSubtracting $4x$ from both sides, we get\n$$5=3x-7$$\nAdding 7 to both sides, we get\n$$12=3x$$\nDividing both sides by 3, we get\n$$x=4$$\nFinally, $4x$, the original number of blue marbles, is $4 \\times 4=\\boxed{61}$.\nThat\u2019s the answer to the question. So 61 were in the bag before I added more.\n### My Thoughts: The problem can be understood as if the original number of blue marbles is represented by $4x$ and the number of yellow marbles is $3x$. Then after adding 5 blue marbles and removing 3 yellow marbles, we obtain $4x+5$ and $3x-3$ which must be in 7:3 ratio. The problem is asking us to find out the number of blue marbles $4x$ which is $61$ and is getting the ratio of blue and yellow in terms of $x$. \n### Tag: [Number_Theory], [Ratio], [Equation_Solving], [Problem_Solving] This problem was informative and well-posed.

        " \nLet y be the number of yellow marbles initially. Then 4/3*y = number of blue marbles initially. Therefore, the total number of marbles initially is 7/3*y.\nAfter adding 5 blue marbles, the total number of blue marbles becomes 4/3*y + 5. After removing 3 yellow marbles, the total number of yellow marbles becomes y - 3.\nTherefore, (4/3*y + 5) / (y - 3) = 7/3.\nNow, multiply both sides by 3(y - 3) to get:\n4y + 15 = 7y - 21\nSubtract 4y from both sides:\n15 = 3y - 21\nAdd 21 to both sides:\n36 = 3y\nDivide both sides by 3:\n12 = y\nTherefore, the number of blue marbles initially is 4/3 * 12 = 16.\n### Explanation:\nWe set the number of blue marbles initially as 4/3*y, and the number of yellow marbles initially as y. The total number of marbles initially is then 7/3*y. We add 5 blue marbles and remove 3 yellow marbles, so the total number of blue marbles becomes 4/3*y + 5, and the total number of yellow marbles becomes y - 3. We set up the ratio equation (4/3*y + 5) / (y - 3) = 7/3 and solve for y. We find y = 12, which means there were 16 blue marbles initially. That\u2019s the answer! Here\u2019s the rest of the step-by-step solution:\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 16. I hope it is correct.",
        " To make this easier, we can set up a system of equations. Let x be the original number of blue marbles. Then, let y be the original number of yellow marbles. We have two equations:\nx + 5 \u00f7 x \u00f7 (x + 5 - 3) = 4 \u00f7 3.\nSimplifying the left side of the equation, we get: =\nSimplifying the right side of the equation, we get: =.\nCombining the two equations, we get:. We can solve for the value of x by dividing both sides of the equation by 4.\nSo x = 15.\nTherefore, there were 15 blue marbles in the bag before I added more. Hence, 15 is the final answer.
