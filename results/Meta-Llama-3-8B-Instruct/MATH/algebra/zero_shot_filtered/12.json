        " $(\\sqrt{8^{2}+6^{2}} = 10.)$\nWe can find the distance using the distance formula.

Therefore $x = 0$ or $x = 2$. For these values, we find\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mbox{when} \\ x=0 & \\ \\sqrt{0 + 16} = \\sqrt{16} = 4\\\\\n& -2 \\cdot 0 + 4 = 4.\n\\end{align*}\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mbox{when } \\ x=2 & \\ \\sqrt{2^{2} + 16} = \\sqrt{20} = 2 \\sqrt{5}\\\\\n& -2 \\cdot 2 + 4 = 0\n\\end{align*}\nThus the two points of intersection are $x = 0$ and",

What is a floating-point number? A floating-point number is a number that contains a decimal point. It is also known as a floating-point literal. It can also be a number that is written in scientific notation. Floating-point numbers have two main parts: the significand (also called the mantissa) and the exponent. The significand is the number before the decimal point and the exponent is the number after the decimal point, starting with E or e for exponent. Floating-point numbers in python, you can write them in different ways such as integer numbers that are always floating-point by adding a period (.) and/or a prefix 0 to a decimal number.

        " The distance of $(a,b)$ is $\\sqrt{a^2+b^2}$.\nThe origin is the point $(0,0)$. So, the number of units in the distance from the origin to the point $(-8,6)$ is $\\sqrt{(-8)^2+6^2} = \\boxed{10}$.\nSo the answer is 10.\nThank you. :smile:\n### An alternative solution.\nWe know that $(x_1-y_1)^2+(x_2-y_2)^2 = (x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2$ if the point $(x_1,y_1)$ is the origin. So, we can say:\n$$(0-(-8))^2+(0-6)^2=0^2+(-8)^2+6^2=100.$$\nTherefore, the number of units of distance from the origin to $(-8,6)$ is $10$. This is the same as the one we previously calculated using $\\sqrt{(-8)^2+6^2}$. :smile:\nWe should get the same answer.\n### Edit (added by me).\nIf we are not familiar with the distance formula from the origin, what we can do is:\n$\\sqrt{0^2+8^2+6^2} = \\sqrt{100} = \\boxed{10}$.\nThe distances from $0$ to $8$ and from $0$ to $6$ are both $x$, so $\\sqrt{(8)^2+6^2}=\\sqrt{100}=\\boxed{10}$.\nThese are easy ways to calculate the distance, especially if you are not familiar with the $\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$ formula.\n#### Conclusion:\nWe can use multiple methods to find the distance from the origin to $(-8,6)$ in a coordinate system. The methods we can use include:\n1. The square root method: $\\sqrt{(-8)^2+6^2}=\\boxed{10}$.\n2. The distance formula: $\\sqrt{0^2+8^2+6^2}=\\sqrt{100}=\\boxed{10}$.\n3. The other method for distance: $(0-(-8))^2+(0-6)^2=0^2+(-8)^2+6^2=100$.\nAll of these methods will give you the same answer: $10$",

        " An introduction to vectors\nA vector $\\vec{a}$ has a magnitude, which is its length, denoted by $|\\vec{a}|$. The magnitude is typically measured by finding the square root of the sum of the squares of the components of the vector.\nIn the two-dimensional case, such as this problem, a vector is represented as an ordered pair of numbers, that is $\\vec{a} = (a_1,a_2)$.\nThe distance of the point $(-8,6)$ from the origin $(0,0)$ is the magnitude of the vector that starts at the origin and ends at the point $(-8,6)$. In other words, we are considering the vector $\\vec{a} = (-8,6).$\nSo the magnitude of this vector will give us the $\\boxed{10}$ units of the distance.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 10.
