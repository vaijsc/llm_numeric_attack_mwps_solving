You could have added more parentheses for clarity, but you didn't need them in this case. That level of clarity in your math can be super valuable in conveying your ideas and avoiding ambiguity.\nThe correct method for carrying out this kind of work involves sorting what you have at hand in a logical manner; here, isolating the fractional piece and then multiplying it with itself for the second part of the solution section. I must admit, some would see this as just a straightforward, elementary calculation. Nonetheless, by going through these simple step-by-step calculations, you should have a clear-cut answer consisting of no ambiguity, giving you accuracy and allowing for the exploitation of each step.\nYou only need to have the first three lines of the solution, really. The remainder of your work was already solved in your work itself, so you may omit it. So your verbiage was superfluous and excessive.\nIt\u2019s nice to have room for improvement, though.
