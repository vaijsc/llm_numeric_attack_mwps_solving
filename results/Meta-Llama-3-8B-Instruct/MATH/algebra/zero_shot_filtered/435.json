That's why we have 2^12. The power is 12, and we have the same idea to raise 2 to 12.

Thank you for your question. Find free test preparation and practice tests for various subjects. Learn and prepare well. Good luck and hope you achieve your goals. Have a great day. So, the equation is $\\sqrt[12]{8^4}$. That is 8 to the power of 4, with the 12th root. So we can simplify it. $\\sqrt[12]{2^{24}}$ Now we can simplify by breaking the 24 down to 2 x 12, which means we can take out the 2 and we have 2 to the power of 12. So, this can be simplified to $2^{\\frac{24}{12}}$. The 12 and the 24 can be taken out because they are both divisible by 12. Therefore, we have $2^2$. The final answer is 4. I hope it is correct. Let me know if you have any questions. I will be there for you. I hope this helps you to learn and remember. Let me know if you have any questions. I will be there for you.
