I hope it is correct. However, this isn\u2019t quite correct because we should get rid of the parentheses first before doing anything else. Let\u2019s fix that by doing $\\color{brown}(x+2x)$. Then we should factor out the $x$ on the right side. \\begin{align*}\nx^2+&2x(5-x)+(5-x)^2\\\\\n&=x^2+2x(5-x)+\\color{brown}(5-x)(5-x)\\\\\n&=x^2+2x\\color{brown}(5-x)+(5-x)\\color{brown}(5-x)\\\\\n&=x^2+\\color{brown}(2x)x+5x-\\color{brown}x^2+x^2-10x+25\\\\\n&=x^2+(2x+x^2)-(10x)+25\\\\\n&=(x^2+2x+x^2)-(10x)+25\\\\\n&=\\color{brown}(x+x)^2-10x+25\\\\\n&=(x+x)^2-10x+25\\\\\n&=(x+5-x)^2-10x+25\\\\\n&=25-10x+25\\\\\n&=50-10x.\n\\end{align*}\nWe see that the given expression is $50-10x$, which must be equal to $x^2+2x(5-x)+(5-x)^2$. So, we should conclude that this expression is not determined solely by $x$ itself but by the equation $x$ is applied to; we should remember this in the future. I hope this step is correct.

        " So far I have mostly solved the following: $x^2+2x(5-x)+(5-x)^2$\nNow I am stuck. Can I have some help? \n### Solution:\nWe need to think of how to add three terms. To make things easier, I will write everything using simple terms.\nWe have the following expression: $x^2+2x(5-x)+(5-x)^2$\nThe expression can be rewritten as $(x+5-x)^2$. Using this we can solve the expression as follows: $(x+5-x)^2$\nThis is in fact $x^2+2x(5-x)+(5-x)^2$. Evaluating it gives us $(0)^2$\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{0}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 0.

Thank you for asking. 2017AJHSME #4  SOLUTION: This problem is asking us to rewrite the expression: x2 + 2x(5-x) + (5-x)2. Since a square always equals a positive number, we know that (x+5-x)2 \u2265 0 for all values of x, but since we know that both terms in the expression have to be positive, we can conclude that x^2 + 2x(5-x) + (5-x) ^2 \u2265 0 for all values of x. and we also see that the term (A-B)(A+B) will factor out. You can see that when both the (A-B) and (A+B) are positive, then you see that the term becomes positive too. and we know that both (A-B) and (A+B) will be positive when A and B are greater than the value of zero.\nBut we also know that we have to find the value of x^2 + 2x(5-x) + (5-x)2that has a value of 0 and we see when (A-B) and (A+B) both have the value of 0. This would be when either the (A-B)or (A+B)is zero. So we know that either the (x+5-x) or (x+5-x)has to be equal to 0.\nAnd we know that (5-x)=0 when x is equal to 5 and we know that (x+5-x)=x+5-x. We also know that (A-B)^2 = A^2-2AB+B^2. a+b everybody knows this one. So when we take this method. We get (x+5-x)^2=(x+5-x)(x+5+x). And we find that the value of 0 when either the (A-B)or (A+B)is zero. So we know that either the (x+5-x) or (x+5-x) has to be equal to 0.\nAnd we know that 5-x=0 when 5-x=0. And we know that 5-x+x=5. We also know that (A-B)^2 =",
