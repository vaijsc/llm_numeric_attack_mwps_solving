        " \nThe expression $\\frac 25$ says that 5 is to 2 as x (It\u2019s only a variable name) is to 60. This gives us the following proportion: $$\\frac 5 2 = \\frac x {60}.$$The expression $\\frac A {60}$ tells us that A is to 60 as 5 is to 2. This gives us another proportion: $$\\frac A {60} = \\frac 5 2.$$If we equate the equivalent fractions from these two proportions, we get \\begin{align*} \\frac x {60} &= \\frac 5 2\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad x &= \\boxed{100}. \\end{align*}The last expression says that 60 is to B as 5 is to 2. This gives us yet another proportion: $$\\frac {60}B = \\frac 5 2.$$This gives us $B = 12$. Now, $A + B = 100 + 12 = \\boxed{112}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 112. I hope it is correct.  This is a very complicated way of doing something simple.  You could just use cross-multiplication.  To do this, we would multiply the given fractions across and across, so that the two numerators are equal to each other.  We would then isolate x: \\begin{align*} \\frac 5 2\\cdot 60 &= \\frac A {60}\\cdot 120\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad x &= 300. \\end{align*}  So $A+B=100+300=\\boxed{400}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 400. I hope it is correct. Thank you for your support.  If we then substitute this value of x (or A), back into either of the two linear equations in the system, we will obtain the corresponding value of B.  In this case, we would plug in x = 300 into the linear equation $\\frac 25=\\frac A{60}$, giving $\\frac 25=\\frac{300}{60},$ which, when simplified, gives us B = 12.  So A + B = 300 + 12 = 312.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 312. I hope it is correct. \u2022 Final Answer: The final answer is 112. I hope it is correct. Thank you for your support. Final",

In order to solve this, let us convert all the fractions into one: \\begin{align*}\\frac 25&=\\frac A{60}\\\\ 25 \\times 60 &= A \\times 5 \\\\ 1500 &= 5 A \\\\ A &= \\frac{1500}{5} \\\\ &= 300 \\end{align*}\nNow we have our value of $A$ to be $300$. Similarly, $\\frac 25 = \\frac{60}B$ So we have\n\\begin{align*} \\frac25 &= \\frac{60}B\\\\ 25 \\times B &= 5 \\times 60\\\\ 5B &= 600\\\\ B &= \\frac{600}{5}\\\\ &= 120 \\end{align*}\nSo, we now have our values: $A = 300 and B = 120$. To find out $A + B$, we add $300$ and $120$ together: $A + B = 300 + 120 = 420$\nTherefore, $A + B = 420$. Theory: Is the given solution correct or"
