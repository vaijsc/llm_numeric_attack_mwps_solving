        " \n 1. We first see that 49 = 7^2.\n2. Now, we use a known identity, which is $(a^b)^c = a^{bc}$.  We put $a = 7$ and $b = \\log_x 49$ and $c = 2$ in this identity, and we get $$7^{2\\log_x 49} = 7^{\\log_x 7^2}$$.\n3. Now, we observe that $\\log_x 7^2 = 2 \\log_x 7$ (this can be seen by using the identity $\\log_x a^b = b \\log_x a$).\n4. Hence, $7^{2\\log_x 49} = 7^{2\\log_x 7}$.  We want to turn the $7$ in the right-hand side into $49$; that happens by splitting $49 = 7^2$.  So, $$7^{2\\log_x 7} = (7^2)^{\\log_x 7} = 49^{\\log_x 7} = 7^{\\log_x 7^2} = 7^{\\log_x 49}$$.\n5. Therefore, $$7^{2\\log_x 49} = 7^{\\log_x 49}$$\n6. Since the bases are the same and they are both greater than $0$, the exponents must be the same.  Hence, $2 \\log_x 49 = \\log_x 49$.  Dividing both sides by $\\log_x 49$, we get $\\log_x 49 = 2$, which simplifies to $x = \\boxed{49}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 49. I hope it is correct.  I have taken into account that $7 > 0$, and the condition for the squaring is that $49$ is positive.   I cannot make any other transformations.   If this is not satisfactory, I do not know how to solve this problem.  I am adding a request for a hint a couple of years ago.  Add a real number for $7$x or $3$ other numbers.   The original statement does not make sense because $\\log_x 49$ is not a real number. This question is based on an attempt by a student to mimic a valid mathematics concept and does not actually belong in the mathematics curriculum.    \"",
        " Well, let\u2019s apply the property $\\log_{x} x^{n} = n.$\nLet\u2019s study the expression $7^{\\log_x 49} = 7^{\\frac{\\log_{49} 49}{\\log_x 49}}.$\n### ",

The right hand side will give us $\\log_{7} 49$, and we can use properties of logarithms to modify the left hand side.  We have that $\\log 7^{\\log_{x} 49} = \\log 49$.\n### Step\nUsing properties of logarithms, the above becomes $\\left(\\log_{x} 49\\right) \\log 7 = \\log 49$.  From this point, it's easy to see.  It simplifies to $\\log_{x} 49 = \\frac{\\log 49}{\\log 7} = 2$, i.e. $x = \\boxed{7^2 = 49}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 49.

We have\n$$7^{\\log_x 49} = 7^{\\log_x (7^2)} = 7^{\\log_x 7^2} = 7^{2\\log_x 7}=7^{2} = 49.$$\nTherefore, $\\boxed{49}$ is the answer to the problem. 2018-03-22 10:36:15 WrBpi\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 49.

Replace $2\\log_x 7$ by this expression: $7^{\\log_x 49} = 49$\n$7^{2\\log_x 7} = 49$ is now straightforward to solve.\n3. The given equation becomes: $7^{2\\log_x 7} = 49$\nTherefore, $2\\log_x 7 = \\log_x 49$\n4. Simplify using $\\log_x x = 1$\n5. We have $2\\log_x 7 = 1$\nAnd we are here, let\u2019s simplify it: $2\\log_x 7 = 1$\n$\\log_x 7 = 1/2$ which is straightforward.\n6. Now we have $\\log_x 7 = 1/2$, we can calculate the expression for $x$:\n$\\log_x 7 = \\frac{1}{2} \\Rightarrow 7^{1/2} = x \\Rightarrow \\boxed{x = 7^{1/2} = \\sqrt{7}}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is x = \\sqrt{7}.

        " \n### $7^{log_x49}=49$\nGiven $7^{\\log_x 49} = 49$, we solving for $x$.\nFirst, we know that $\\log_{49} 7 = \\frac{1}{2}$ because $7^2=49$.\n### $7^{log_x 49}=7^{1}=7=49$\nTherefore, $\\log_x 49 = 1$, so $\\boxed{x = 49}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 49. I hope it is correct. ",
        " \nSince $7^{\\log_x 49}$ is an exponent in the form $a^b$, we would like to find $b$. Now notice that $\\log_x 49 = \\frac{\\log 49}{\\log x}$.\n### Explanation: \nWe can rewrite $7^{\\log_x 49}$ using the properties of logarithms. Recall that $\\log ab = \\log a + \\log b$ and $\\log a^b = b\\log a$. We have that $a=7$, $\\log a^b = \\log 7^b$ and $\\log a = \\log 7$. Noting that $\\log 7^b = b\\log 7$, we can write $7^{\\log_x 49} = 7^{\\frac{\\log 49}{\\log x}}$.\n### Explanation: \nUsing the definition of the logarithm, we have that $\\log a = \\frac{\\ln a}{\\ln 10}$. Therefore, $\\frac{\\log 49}{\\log x} = \\frac{\\frac{\\ln 49}{\\ln 10}}{\\frac{\\ln x}{\\ln 10}} = \\frac{\\ln 49}{\\ln x}$. Now we have $7^{\\frac{\\ln 49}{\\ln x}}$. Continuing to apply the rules of logarithms, we have that $\\ln 49 = \\ln 7^2 = 2\\ln 7$ and $\\ln x = \\frac{\\ln 10}{\\log_{10}x}$.\n### Explanation: \nNow the equation is simplified to $7^{\\frac{2\\ln 7}{\\ln x}}$. So, we need to solve $7^{\\frac{2\\ln 7}{\\ln x}} = 49$. Since the base and exponent are identical, the two sides are equal if the exponents are equal. As 7 is not equal to 49, we need to equate the exponent $\\frac{2\\ln 7}{\\ln x}$ with $\\log 49$. Equating them, we have $\\frac{2\\ln 7}{\\ln x} = \\log 49$.\n### Explanation: \nNow we have $\\frac{2\\ln 7}{\\ln x} = \\log 49$. Let\u2019s rewrite $\\log 49$ as $\\log 7^2$ in terms of the logarithm.",
        " Define $y = \\log_x 49$.\n### ",
        " Let\u2019s think step by step. So we have $7^{\\log_x 49} = 49.$ We will use the property of logarithms which says that $\\log a^b = b \\cdot \\log a.$ So, if we have $7^{\\log_x 49} = 7^{\\log_7 49},$ we can replace the $7^{\\log_x 49}$ by $\\log_7 49.$ So the equation is now:$$\\log_7 49 = 7^{\\log_7 49}.$$Now we will use the property of logarithms again, which says that $\\log a = b$ if and only if $\\log a = c$ where $a = c.$ Okay, so if $7^{\\log_7 49} = 49,$ we have that $49 = 49.$\nNow we go back to the original equation\n$7^{\\log_x 49} = 7^{\\log_7 49}.$ When we have two terms that have the same base, we can set them equal to each other and solve for the part that is not the base. $$\\log_x 49 = \\log_7 49.$$ Now we can solve for $x.$\nThe property of logarithms that will help us now says that $\\log_a b = c$ if and only if $\\log a b = c + \\log a = c \\log a.$ Let\u2019s apply it. We have: $\\log 49 = \\log 7 + \\log 7 = 2 \\log 7.$\nThis comes from the fact that $\\log 7^2 = 2 \\log 7.$ Thus, we have that $\\log_7 49 = 2.$ Substituting the value back into the equation, we have that $\\log_x 49 = 2.$\nSo now, we can solve for $x.$ The property of logarithms that will help us now says that $\\log c = d$ if and only if $c = 10^d.$ Okay, so we have that $10^{2} = x.$ Thus, $x = \\boxed{100}.$\n### ",
        " $7^{\\log_x 49} = 49$.\nThis is a funky one!  This is saying you are taking 7 to the power of the logarithm of 49 with base x. Now, let\u2019s apply some of the properties of logarithms.\n### ",
        " $x = 7$\nWe are given the equation $7^{\\log_x 49} = 49$. Since the base of the exponential is $7$, let $y = \\log_x 49$, so that $7^y = 49$.
