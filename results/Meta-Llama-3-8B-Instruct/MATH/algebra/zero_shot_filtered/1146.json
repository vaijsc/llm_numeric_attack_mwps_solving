        "To determine how many total toy cars Aiden has received from Jo by the time he turns 12, we can follow these steps:\n1. **Identify the number of cars received each year:** \n   - On Aiden's 1st birthday, he received 1 car.\n   - On Aiden's 2nd birthday, he received 2 cars.\n   - On Aiden's 3rd birthday, he received 3 cars.\n   - ...\n   - On Aiden's 12th birthday, he received 12 cars.\n2. **Recognize the pattern:** \n   - The number of toy cars Aiden receives each year is equal to his age. Therefore, the total number of cars he receives can be represented as the sum of the first 12 positive integers.\n3. **Calculate the total number of cars using the formula for the sum of the first n integers:** \n   - The formula for the sum of the first n integers is: \n     \\[\n     S_n = \\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\n     \\]\n   - Here, n is 12, since we are calculating the sum up to Aiden's 12th birthday.\n4. **Plug in the value of n:**\n   \\[\n   S_{12} = \\frac{12(12 + 1)}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   S_{12} = \\frac{12 \\times 13}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   S_{12} = \\frac{156}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   S_{12} = 78\n   \\]\nSo, after receiving cars for his 12th birthday, Aiden will have received a total of **78 toy cars** from Jo.",

For his first birthday, he received 1 car. For his second birthday, he received 2 cars. For his third birthday, he received 3 cars. And so on up to his 12th birthday. To find the total number of cars received, we need to add the numbers of cars received for each birthday. $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 = \\frac{12(12 + 1)}{2} = \\boxed{78}$ This is the total number of cars Aiden will have received after receiving the cars for his 12th birthday. I hope it is correct.  Aiden received a total of $\\boxed{78}$ toy cars. Final Answer: The final answer is 78. I hope it is correct. Donna ### Full-stepwise solution: We know that Aiden has received at least one toy car every birthday starting from his first birthday. We can add up all his birthdays from age 1 to 12. He received 1 car on his first birthday. On his second birthday, he received 2 cars. On his third birthday, he received 3 cars. So we would add 1 + 2 to get 3. On his fourth birthday, he received 4 cars. So we would add 3 + 4 to get 7. We can keep going. On his twelfth birthday, he received 12 cars. So we would add 7 + 12 to get 19. Then 19 + 13 = 32, 32 + 14 = 46, 46 + 15 = 61, 61 + 16 = 77, 77 + 12 = 89. The answer is 78. Final Answer: The final answer is 78. I hope it is correct. Donna  Another way is to use the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers: $$1+2+3+\\cdots+n=\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$ Using this formula for $$n=12$$, we have: $$1+2+3+\\cdots+12=\\frac{12(12+1)}{2}=78$$ So, the",
        " Aiden will have received at least 12toy cars from Aiden, since he will have received at least one toy car every birthday. He received one on his first birthday, two on his second birthday, so on. We can represent this as 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 cars. So he will have received 78 cars. Final Answer: The final answer is 78. I hope it is correct. 1 each, then 2 cars, then 3, and so on up to 12, which is the sum of all the numbers from 1 to 12. 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 = 78.

        " Aiden will receive 1 car for his 1st birthday.  2 cars for his 2nd birthday (1 + 1 = 2).  3 cars for his 3rd birthday (1 + 2 = 3).  And so forth, until he receives 12 cars for his 12th birthday.  1 + 2 + 3 + . . . + 12 = 78.  So after his 12th birthday,  Aiden will have 78 toy cars.  Final Answer: The final answer is 78. I hope it is correct. \nSource: https://www.mathopenref.com/sumfor.html\nThis question is illustrating the example given for the formula of the sum of an arithmetic sequence. In the question, the number of cars given to Aiden by his mother corresponds to his age, which increases by 1 each year. The formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence is:\nSum = n/2(a1 + a)\nWhere n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and a is the common difference.\nIn this case, n = 12, a1 = 1, and a = 1. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\nSum = 12/2(1 + 1)\nSum = 6(2)\nSum = 12\nSo the total number of cars Aiden has received is 12. However, this is an incorrect answer because the question states that Jo gave Aiden at least one toy car every birthday. This means that the first birthday is not included in the sum, so the correct answer should be the sum of the arithmetic sequence starting from 2 to 12. Using the formula above, we get:\nSum = 12/2(2 + 1)\nSum = 6(3)\nSum = 18\nSo, after his 12th birthday, Aiden will have 18 toy cars. I hope this clears up any confusion.
