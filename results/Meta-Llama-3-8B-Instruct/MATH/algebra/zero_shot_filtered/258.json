        " Let x, y be the two numbers, so x + y = 40, x - y = 12.\nSince x + y = 40, we can write y = 40 - x. Therefore, x - y = x - (40 - x) = 12\nSo, 2x = 52, or x = 26.\nNow we know x = 26.

I used algebraic manipulations to solve the equations, first simplifying the sum equation and the difference equation, and then substituting one equation into the other to isolate one of the variables. Once I found one variable, I used either equation to find the other variable, and finally found their product.

        " Let\u2019s start with the information that the sum of the numbers is 40. We can say $x + y = 40$, where $x$ and $y$ are the unknown numbers. We also know that the difference between the numbers is 12, which we can write as $x - y = 12$. Can you add the two equations together? If we add the two equations, we get $x + y + x - y = 40 + 12$, which simplifies to $2x = 52$. Can you solve this equation to find $x$? To find $x$, we need to isolate $x$ on one side of the equation. We do this by dividing both sides by 2, which results in $x = 26$. Now that we have found $x$, we can use one of our original equations to find $y$. Using the equation $x + y = 40$, we can plug $x$ in for $x$ and solve for $y$: $26 + y = 40$, which simplifies to $y = 40 - 26 = 14$. Great job! Now we know that $x = 26$ and $y = 14$. To find the product of the two numbers, we multiply them together: $x * y = 26 * 14 = \\boxed{364}$ Ahah! Good work, I hope this helps\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 364. I hope it is correct.

        " The sum of the two numbers and their difference are given so the problem can be expressed as\n$a-b=12$\n$a+b=40$\n$40-a=12$\n$28=a$\n$a$ is equal to 28. Now we substitute this value of $a$ into one of the other equations. We can use either equation, but let\u2019s use the second one since it doesn\u2019t have the same variables on the left and right sides. Doing so, we get\n$28+b=40$\n$12+b=40$\n$b=28$\nNow we have both numbers. The problem asked for the product of the numbers. We can get it by simply multiplying 28 by 28 to get\n$\\boxed{784}.$",
        " So the sum of the two numbers is 40. Let\u2019s call their sum $x$.\nWe know $x$ equals $40$. This is the same as saying $x + x$ is equal to $40$. That equals $2x$. So we know $2x$ is equal to $40$. We can divide both sides by $2$ to solve for $x$. $x$ would be equal to $40 \\div 2$, which is $20$. That\u2019s half of $40$, so $x$ is equal to $20$.\nCheck yourself!: We know that $20 + 20$ is $40$, so it seems correct that the sum of the numbers is $40$.\nNow, let\u2019s think about the difference. We know that the difference of the two numbers is $12$. Let\u2019s let the bigger number be $x + 8$, and the smaller number be $x - 8$. We know $x + 8$ is $12$ more than $x - 8$, which means $x + 8$ minus $x - 8$ is equal to $12$. That means $(x + 8) - (x - 8)$ is equal to $12$. This equals $16$. $20$ plus $8$ is $28$, and $20$ minus $8$ is $12$, so we know that $20 + 8$ is $28$, and $20 - 8$ is $12$. That\u2019s the same as saying $20 - 8$ minus $16$ minus $16$ or $x + 8$ minus $16$ minus $16$, so $x + 8 - (x - 8)$ is the same as saying $20 + 8 - (20 - 8)$.\nLet\u2019s now get back to the bigger number. We know that $x + 8$ is equal to $20 + 8$, and we know that $x - 8$ is equal to $20 - 8$. We also know that when you subtract $x$ from $x$, that equals $0$. So we know $x + 8$ minus $x + 8$ is $16$. We can simplify that to $20 - 8$, so $x + 8$ minus $x$ is equal to $8$. That means $20$ minus $8$ plus $8$ is $20$. $16$ plus $4",

        " \n1. Let\u2019s name the two numbers as x and y.\n2. Since the sum of the numbers is 40, we can write the equation as:\nx + y = 40\n3. We are also given that the difference between the two numbers is 12, so we can write the equation as:\nx - y = 12\n4. We have two equations and two variables. We can solve this system of equations by adding the equations.\nx + y = 40\nx - y = 12\nAdding both equations, we get:\n2x = 52\n5. Dividing both sides by 2, we get:\nx = 26\n6. Now that we have found x, we can substitute this value back into one of the original equations to find y. Let\u2019s use the first equation:\n26 + y = 40\n7.

        " If the sum of two numbers is 40, it means that one of the numbers is either 40 minus 12 or 40 plus 12, or 40 minus 12 is equal to 28, so the other number is 40 minus 28, which is 12.  Or, 40 plus 12 is equal to 52, so the other number is 40 minus 52, which is -12.  If the product is 12 and 28, then 12 times 28 is 336.  If the product is 12 and -12, then 12 times -12 is -144.",

In equation (2) replace x by y - 2y. => y - 2y - 2y = 12 - 2y => -4y = 12 => -4y/(-4) = 12/(-4) => y = -3. It seems that we did not found the right numbers yet.

        " To find the product of the two numbers, we first need to find the two numbers. To do this, we set up an equation based on the two given facts. Let the two numbers be x and y.
