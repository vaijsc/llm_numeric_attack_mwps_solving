        " The first step is to get the equation into the form\n$$f(x)=\\frac{2x}{(x-a)(x-b)}.$$To do this, let\u2019s work backwards starting from $f(x)=\\frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14}$.\nThe second step is to divide both the numerator and denominator by 2:\n$$f(x)=\\frac{x}{\\left(x^2-5x-14\\right)\\cdot \\frac{1}{2}}.$$This is almost in the desired form.  The fact that $\\frac{1}{2}$ is outside the parentheses doesn\u2019t matter because $(x-a)(x-b)$ is just a polynomial that doesn\u2019t affect the actual expression of $f(x)$.\nWe just need to bring the factors $(x-a)(x-b)$ to the right side of the equation by subtracting them from the denominator:\n$$f(x)=\\frac{x}{\\left(x^2-5x-14\\right)\\cdot \\frac{1}{2}-(x-a)(x-b)}.$$Multiplying and simplifying, we get\n$$f(x)=\\frac{x}{\\frac{x^2-5x-14}{2}-(x-a)(x-b)}=\\frac{x}{\\frac{1}{2}(x^2-5x-14)-(x-a)(x-b)}=\\frac{x}{\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{(x-a)(x-b)}{(x^2-5x-14)}}.$$This matches the desired form.

        " \nStep 1: Find the vertical asymptotes.  To do this, we look for the values of $x$ where $x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0$ by solving $x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0$.

Looking at the expression for $f(x)$, we notice that $x^2$ grows quadratically with $x$ faster than any power of $x$.  So, the dominant term is $x^2$.  The other term, $-5x$, only gets smaller as $x \\to \\pm \\infty$ and thus will be negligible for large $x$.  Similarly, the term $14$ is also constant for large $x$ and thus has no bearing on the limiting behavior.  So, the function behaves as \\begin{align*}\nf(x)\\approx \\frac{2x}{x^2}=\\frac{2}{x} \\end{align*}as $x\\to\\pm\\infty$.  As $x\\to\\infty$, $\\frac{2}{x} \\to 0$, and as $x \\to -\\infty$, $\\frac{2}{x} \\to 0$.

        " Step 1. Clean the expression\nLet\u2019s begin by simplifying the expression $f(x)=\\frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14}$.\nWe can factor the denominator $x^2-5x-14$ to make it easier to find the asymptotes.\nLet $x^2-5x-14=(x-a)(x-b)$.  Expanding this we get $x^2-5x-14=x^2-ax-bx+ab=x^2-(a+b)x+ab$, so we can read off that $a+b=5$ and $ab=-14$.  From this, we can find $a$ and $b$ using the quadratic formula or other means.  We should choose $a$ and $b$ to be real.\nThen, by the factorization $f(x)=\\frac{2x}{(x-a)(x-b)}$, we know $f(x)\\neq 0$ if $x\\neq a$ or $x\\neq b$, so $f(x)$ has vertical asymptotes at $x=a$ and $x=b$.  By the fundamental theorem of algebra, we also know $f(x)=0$ if $x=a$ or $x=b$.\nNow we can perform a long division or polynomial division to find the horizontal asymptote of $f(x)$.\nWe can do long division if you want.\nStep 2. Find the horizontal asymptote\nWe divide $2x$ by $x^2-5x-14$.\nLooking at the result, we can see that in the long division, the highest degree term from the quotient is a degree 1 polynomial.  Therefore, the horizontal asymptote is $y=\\frac{2}{0}=+\\infty$.\nAlternatively, from the expression $f(x)=\\frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14}$, we know that $\\lim_{x\\rightarrow\\pm\\infty}f(x)=\\lim_{x\\rightarrow\\pm\\infty}\\frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14}$.\nTo evaluate the limit as $x$ approaches positive or negative infinity, we can divide the numerator and denominator of the fraction by the highest degree term, which is $x^2$.  This gives $\\lim_{x\\rightarrow\\pm\\infty}f(x)=\\lim_{x\\rightarrow\\pm\\infty}\\",

It seems all answers are correct in it. I have included it However, I will explain it in brief I believe it I will keep. My understanding in brief: Find vertical asymptotes, horizontal"
