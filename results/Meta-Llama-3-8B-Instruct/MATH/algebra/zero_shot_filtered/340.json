        " What are some immediate observations that we can make?  To solve this problem we will look at its answer.  This will be done by finding the degree of the polynomial $h(x)$.",
        " Concept Check\nLet\u2019s start by thinking about what a factor of a polynomial looks like.  A factor is a polynomial $p(x)$ such that $p(x)$ divides $f(x)$, meaning that $f(x) = q(x)p(x)$ for some polynomial $q(x)$.  This means that when we divide $f(x)$ by $p(x)$, we obtain a quotient $q(x)$ of degree less than $\\boxed{\\deg p(x)}$.\nNow, in our problem, we know that $h(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $5$, and it is factored into two parts: $(x^2-7x+10) \\cdot g(x)$.  This means that $(x^2-7x+10)$ is a factor of $h(x)$, so let\u2019s see what it looks like.  Well, \\begin{align*}\nx^2-7x+10 &= x^2-7x+10 \\\\\n&= (x-10)(x+1). \\\\\n\\end{align*}\nWe can verify that this is indeed a factorization by distributing and getting back to $(x^2-7x+10)$.  Really, we have to check the factorization against every factor of $x^2-7x+10$, but we can save some time and split $x^2-7x+10$ up into a product of its factors like we did here.\nSince $(x^2-7x+10)$ has degree $2$, we know that it cannot divide the other term in our factorization, since $g(x)$ has a higher degree.  So to have $h(x)$ have degree $5$, $g(x)$ must also have degree $3$, or $\\boxed{b=3}$.\nSo what do we have to do to find $b$?  Well, $b$ is just the degree of $g(x)$, so we can set that equal to the difference between the degree of $h(x)$ and the degree of $(x^2-7x+10)$ and simplify:\n\\begin{align*}\nb &= \\deg h(x) - \\deg (x^2-7x+10) \\\\\n&= 5 - 2 \\\\\n&= \\boxed{3}. \\\\\n\\end{align*}\nSo we showed that $b = \\boxed{3}$.",
        " First, note that because $h$ is a polynomial of degree $5$, the degree of $(x^2-7x+10) \\cdot g(x)$ must be $5$.  Then, we can say that $$ \\text{degree of }((x^2-7x+10) \\cdot g(x)) = \\text{deg}(x^2-7x+10) + \\text{deg}(g(x)) = 5.$$ Since the degree of a product is either the minimum degree of the factors involved, AND since $$ \\text{deg}(x^2-7x+10) = 2,$$ we can say that $$ 2 + b = 5 \\Rightarrow b = 3.$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 3.

        " We can start by recognizing that $h(x)$ is equal to a polynomial of degree $2$, times a polynomial of degree $b$.

Therefore, $g(x)$ must be a polynomial of degree at least 3, since the highest power in $x^2-7x+10$ is 2. Thus $3 \\le b$. On the other hand, $g(x)$ divides $h(x)$ and if $g(x)$ had degree greater than 3, then $h(x)$ would have degree higher than 5.  So then we must have $b=3$.

        " It\u2019s nice to break it down\nSuppose we want to find the degree of $h(x)$, which should be $5$. In this case, we can write $h(x)=(x^2-7x+10)(a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+\\cdots+a_{b-1}x^{b-1}+x^b),$ where $a_0\\ne 0$ is an arbitrary constant and $a_i$ are numbers. We now simplify the right hand side: \\begin{align*}\nh(x)&=(x^2-7x+10)(a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+\\cdots+a_{b-1}x^{b-1}+x^b)\\\\\n&=a_0x^2-7a_0x+10a_0+(a_1x +a_2x^2+\\cdots+a_{b-1}x^{b-1}+x^b)x\\\\\n&\\quad-a_2x^2-7a_1x+10a_2+\\cdots-a_{b-1}x^{b-1}+7a_0+10a_1+10a_2x\\\\\n&=a_0x^2+(a_1-7a_2+a_0)x+(a_2+\\cdots+a_{b-1}-7a_1+10a_2)x^2\\\\\n&\\quad+(-7a_1+\\cdots+a_{b-1})x^3+\\cdots-7a_{b-2}x^{b-1}+10a_{b-1}x^b\n\\end{align*}We see that $a_0a_1$ and $a_{b-1}$ are the leading coefficients of the quadratic and linear terms of $h(x)$, respectively, so $a_0\\ne 0$, $a_1$, and $a_{b-1}$ are non-zero. Moreover, we see that the largest degree of $h(x)$ is $b$, which is $5$ in the given problem. So, the degree of $g(x)$ must be $5$, that is, $b=\\boxed{5}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 5. I hope it is correct.",
        " First: notice that by the polynomial long division (or remainder theorem, or something like that), since degree of $(x^2-7x+10)$ is $2$, we have the $(x^2-7x+10) = (x-2)(x-5)$.  Hence, $h(x) = (x-2)(x-5)g(x)$.\nSecond: notice that by the polynomial long division (or remainder theorem, or something like that) again, since $h(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $5$, so is $g(x)$.  Therefore, $b = \\boxed{5}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 5. I hope it is correct. Apply the formula for the degree of the product of two polynomials to get that the degree of the product $(x^2-7x+10)g(x)$ is the degree of $x^2-7x+10$, which is $2$, plus the degree of $g(x)$, which is $b$. So $2+ b = 5 \\Rightarrow b = \\boxed{5}$. So, I hope this is correct.\n### Time spent: [insert time spent here]\n### ",

        " b = $5$\nGiven that $h(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 5, first note that since polynomials multiply to have the same degree, then the product $(x^2-7x+10) \\cdot g(x)$ must have a degree of at least 5.  Furthermore, since the leading term of $x^2-7x+10$ is $x^2$, then $g(x)$ also must have at least a degree of 3 in order for the leading term $x^5$ in their product to have a degree of at least 5.\nWe also know that since $g(x)$ is a polynomial, then we can factor out a $(x-2)(x-5)$ from $g(x)$ to make it: $g(x)=(x-2)(x-5)r(x),$ where $r(x)$ is a remainder with degree nonzero (to ensure that $g(x)$ also has degree $b$). Combining with the expression $(x^2-7x+10)g(x)$ and rearranging: $h(x)=(x^2-7x+10)(x-2)(x-5)r(x)$. By inspection, then, the product\u2019s leading term has degree 5, satisfying the given condition, and we can verify that the degree of $r(x)$ no longer matters(It has no effect on the degree of $h(x)$), which can be any nonnegative integer. Therefore, the expression $b$ equals $\\boxed{5}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 5. I hope it is correct.}    Choose the best answer\nWhen I run this answer in Latex, it shows that there is double spacing. Here are the reasons why it happens. The double spacing happens because there are Multiple blank lines between text in the text. For Latex, white spaces are intentionally ignored by default, and sometimes we need to specify the details of the layout.\nHere, I ran in to some  double spacing problem as well. The reason of the problem is \"Indention\". In the above block of Latex code, I mistakenly added an extra blank line here. It caused the double spacing when it was written!   The solution is to do away with the extra blank lines, so it can be written correctly.",
        " You have $h(x) = (x^2-7x+10) \\cdot g(x)$, and it is of degree 5.  That means that the product of the two polynomials on the right-hand side should have degree 5.  You know that $x^2-7x+10$ has degree 2.  If you multiply two polynomials with degrees 2 and $b$, the product will have degree $2+b$, so this product should have degree $2+b=5$, which means $b=\\boxed{3}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 3.

        " Since $h(x)=(x^2-7x+10)\\cdot g(x)$ and the LHS is of degree $5$, the RHS must also be of degree $5$ since $x^2-7x+10$ is already of degree $2$.

        " $h(x)$ has a degree of $5$. Its leading coefficient (the coefficient of $x^5$ when we expand $(x^2-7x+10) \\cdot g(x)$) will come from the leading coefficient of $g(x)$ times the leading coefficient of the polynomial $(x^2-7x+10)$.  So let\u2019s first determine the degree and leading coefficient of $(x^2-7x+10)$.  Remember that the degree of a polynomial is the largest power of $x$ with a nonzero coefficient, and the leading coefficient is the coefficient of this power of $x$.\nWe have that $(x^2-7x+10)$ is a quadratic, so its degree is $2$.  The leading coefficient is $1$, since we can write the polynomial as $x^2 - 7x + 10 = x^2 + 0x + 10$.\nNow that we know the degree and leading coefficient of the quadratic, we can multiply by $g(x)$ to get the degree and leading coefficient of $h(x)$.",

        " To get the highest degree term of $h(x)$, we need to multiply the $x^2$ terms of both $x^2-7x+10$ and $g(x)$.  Therefore, the degree of $g(x)$ is $5-b$, so that we obtain an $x^5$ term when we multiply $x^2$ from each factor.\n### "
