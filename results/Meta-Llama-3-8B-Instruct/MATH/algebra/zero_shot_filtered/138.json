The function is periodic with a period of 3 and the maximum value is 9 , so f(x) = 9 for x = 1. The function f(x) is graphed below is equal to the number left over when you divide, x, by 3. For example, f(1) = 3, which we must and the value in the given graph. For x that leave a remainder of 3 when divided by 3, f(x) will be 9. For x that leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 3, f(x) will be 6. For x that leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 3, f(x) will be 3. We see now that $f(x)=3$ when $x=1,4,7$, $f(x)=6$ when $x=2,5,8$, and $f(x)=9$ when $x=3,6,9$.  Our function is then equal to $3+6+9=18$.

That is right, because we have a 1 on 1-3-5-7, and we have a 2 on 2-4-6-8. By symmetry, for every odd integer, f(x) is x+1, and for every even integer, f(x) is x+2.

Note that the dots of higher $y$-coordinate on the graph of $f(x)$ have lower $x$-values, and vice versa. Since there are $7$ dots with $y$-coordinate $1$ or greater on the graph, if we plug those $x$-values into $f(x)$, we cannot have any dots appearing twice on our sum. The only way we might get a dot twice in our sum is if we plug $x$-values into $f(f(x))$ where $f(x)$ is $1$, affecting the final sum.\nThus, our possible sums are: \\begin{align*}\nf(7)&=9\\\\\nf(4)&=8\\\\\nf(1)&=7\\\\\nf(8)&=6\\\\\nf(2)&=4\\\\\nf(5)&=5\\\\\nf(6)&=2\\\\\nf(3)&=1.\n\\end{align*}Summing these, we get:$$9+8+7+6+4+5+2+1=\\boxed{42}.$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 42.

To see why the answer should be 4, notice that since the graph is periodic with period 3, it has symmetry around the line $y=x$. This tells us that $f(2)=f(5)$, $f(1)=f(4)$, and $f(7)=f(8)$.

We can\u2019t skip steps, and we have to go from the original number to its value to the next number to its value to the next number to its value.  We notice than when we get back to the original number, the function which we first applied will be reapplied to the result.  This is because we took the function at 1 to be evaluated at 7, then the function at 7 to be evaluated at 9, then the function at 9 to be evaluated at 3, and then the function at 3 to be evaluated at 1, so we got back to the original input number.  We need to figure out what $f(f(1))$ is.  When we get $9$ back, the function at 9 is evaluated at 3, which is also 1, because $f(1)=7$ and $f(7)=9$.  At that point, we\u2019re back where we started (after another 3 applications of the function).  Therefore, $f(f(1))=1$.  When $x=2$, $f(x)=4$.  $f(f(2))=f(4)=2$, and $f(2)=4$, so $f(f(f(2)))=f(2)=4$.  When $x=3$, $f(x)=1$.  $f(f(3))=f(1)=7$.  $f(f(f(3)))=f(7)=9$.  $f(f(f(f(3))))=f(9)=3$.  $f(f(f(f(f(3)))))=f(3)=1$.  Thus, $f(f(f(f(f(3)))))=1=f(f(3))$.  Therefore, $f(f(f(f(3))))=f(f(f(3)))=1$, and so on.  Thus, $f(f(f(f(f(3)))))=1, f(f(f(f(f(f(3)))))=1, f(f(f(f(f(f(f(3)))))=1$, etc., so all of these are 1.  When $x=4$, $f(x)=8$.  $f(f(4))=f(8)=",
