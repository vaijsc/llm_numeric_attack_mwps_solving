        " Let\u2019s first evaluate $-\\sqrt{23}.$ Recall that $\\sqrt{4}=2$ and $\\sqrt{9}=3$ are the positive square roots of $4$ and $9,$ respectively. We observe that $1\\cdot 1=1,\\, 2\\cdot2=4,\\,3\\cdot3=9,\\,4\\cdot4=16,\\,5\\cdot5=25,\\,\\ldots$ So, we see that all the square numbers are of the form $n^2=1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81,100,121,\\ldots$ Now, we try to find the perfect square that is just less than $23.$ We can conclude from above that $4^2=16$ and $5^2=25.$ The next perfect square to be found would be $6^2=36,$ which is already greater than $23.$ Therefore, we take the perfect square that is just less than $23,$ that is, $4^2=16$ and $5^2=25.$ So, we find that $-\\sqrt{25}=-5,$ but $-\\sqrt{16}=-4.$ Hence, $-\\sqrt{23}$ is between $-5$ and $-4.$ Therefore, using the ceiling function, $\\left\\lceil {-\\!\\sqrt{23}}\\right\\rceil =\\boxed{-4}.$\nSolution 4. You can always find a perfect square $n^2$, while approximating $-\\sqrt{23}$. So, we can have $-\\sqrt{21}<-\\sqrt{23}<-\\sqrt{25}$. Hence, the greatest integer below $-\\sqrt{23}$ is $-5$.

        " The answer is 5.\nLet's calculate the square root, and then round. Recall that $\\sqrt{25} = 5$ and $\\sqrt{24} = 4\\sqrt{6}$, and that $\\sqrt{25} - \\sqrt{24} = 4$. Therefore, we have $$\\sqrt{23} = \\sqrt{24 - 1} = \\sqrt{24} - \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{24}} = 4\\sqrt{6} - \\frac{1}{2\\cdot 4\\sqrt{6}} = 4\\sqrt{6} - \\frac{1}{8\\sqrt{6}} = 4\\sqrt{6} - \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{16} = \\frac{33\\sqrt{6}}{16},$$ so $\\left\\lceil {-\\!\\sqrt{23}}\\right\\rceil = 5.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 5. I hope it is correct.  I hope it is correct. Moreno90 proof read this solution.",
        " First, consider the quantity $\\sqrt{23}$ in the expression.  We know that $\\sqrt{4}=2$, so $\\sqrt{20}=2\\sqrt{5}$, which means $\\sqrt{16} = 4$, etc.  Squaring the following: \nThis means, the square root sign means we are taking positive square root, because we are interested in whole numbers. As we square different numbers in the above table, we get perfect squares that if taken square root would give us those same numbers.  While $\\sqrt{16}=4$, we know the square root is the reverse of the squaring operation, which means `sqrt(16)` gives us $4$ in this case.  \n#### A relation while squaring.\n![](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest/v1/media/math/render/svg/5c2f05c7a07c25e233a4faa0f136a91c4674a43b) ![](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest/v1/media/math/render/svg/6c say\u0131...)\nNow, we know `sqrt(49)=7` because `7^2=49`, since it is a perfect square.  On the other side, `sqrt(49)` when squared, gives us $49$.  So the pattern from the beginning is `7`, `4`, `16`, `25`, `36`, `49` ... ` n squared will give `sqrt(n^2)=n`  So every number squared, generates another number that when divided by two give a square root of that original number.  Now, we can set up a screenshot of the `sqrt(number)` which can take any perfect square.\n#### Value of `sqrt(23)` before rounding.\n    - Our biggest perfect square is $16=4^2$. Then $17=(4+\\sqrt{17})^2$, which means `sqrt(17)>4` above 4 there. Notice that from $13=(4-\\sqrt{5})^2$ which means `sqrt(13)<4`, that `4` is the last perfect square, and the first number `sqrt(13)` which would equal an irrational value.  Now we just focus on `sqrt(23)`.... `sqrt(20) < sqrt(21)< sqrt(22)< sqrt(23)` Then `sqrt(23)< sqrt(25)=5` because `sqrt(21)` is smaller than `4.5`, `sqrt(22)`",
        " \nRecall that $\\left\\lceil{v}\\right\\rceil$ is the least integer that is greater than or equal to $v$. We only need to find the value for which $-\\sqrt{23}$ is greater than or equal to such a value.\nThe simplist way to solve this problem is to remember that $\\sqrt{25} = 5$ and $\\sqrt{36} = 6$.\nAlso $\\sqrt{20} < 5$ and $\\sqrt{28} > 6$, so it\u2019s clear that $-\\sqrt{23}$ can not be greater than 5 nor less than 6.\nThe best guess now is $\\left\\lceil{-\\sqrt{23}}\\right\\rceil$ is 5, and we can confirm this by computing: \n$$-\\sqrt{23} \\approx -4.8$$\nSo, it\u2019s reasonable to conclude that $\\left\\lceil{-\\sqrt{23}}\\right\\rceil = \\boxed{5}$.",
