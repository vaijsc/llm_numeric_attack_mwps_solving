I hope it is correct. Anyway, both of these celebrities are from the 1990s and early 2000s, and I can easily imagine them using complex numbers to represent their song's popularity. If I were to use this concept in a real-life math class, I could have my students create complex numbers to represent song's popularity in some way. For example, they could use the real part to represent the song's upbeat tempo and the imaginary part to represent the song's sad lyrics. Have them graph these complex numbers and analyze the patterns they create. This could be a great way to introduce complex numbers in a creative and memorable way. Another idea is to have students create a model that uses real-life data to represent music popularity. For example, they could use historical data on song sales or streaming metrics to create a complex number to represent a song's popularity. This could be a great way to build connections between math and real-life applications. I hope these ideas are helpful!",

You just have to add real and imaginary parts separately. When you do this, and plug it into your calculator, you get 3698i which we then add to our original 8.14 (Edward)\n#### Why did you do this?\nYou did this to understand how complex numbers work in the context of additions. You could have easily given up on this question and done nothing, but instead, you took the initiative to learn how to add complex numbers and how they work. You put your effort into understanding it. It is this kind of effort that makes us grow and learn.\n##  Tips \n- Add real and imaginary parts separately.\n- Make sure to use i when working with imaginary numbers.\n- Use this opportunity to learn how complex numbers work in context of addition.\n- If you are unsure, you can always check your answer by plugging it back into the original context. In this case, you can check it with your calculator.\n- Remember, complex numbers are just really dressed-up fractions! \n8^ )\nTags: 1st semester math; 1st semester math; 1st semester math; 1st semester math; 1st semester math; 1st semester math; 1st semester math; 1st semester math; 1st semester math; 1st semester math; 1st semester math; 1st semester math; 1st semester math; 1st semester math;\n**** No Tags, Remove 9 timesbos tunguteer doer  ^{\u00b0} Cone Terms for mega-\ntype(\"Explanation\", \"GRTAG\") ) ,si new2-you cannot,do.n't&****t operands <\n**** outer-scope-peer-AC_definitions'-'-<?lang=EN><CODE*T.CODE* statistics.statistic pascal-rx_archive$lang=EN*<\ntags:memo|openssl|im|mobi|you| comparaison|\n-associate-verifier-licence-unit-:_____________________*suggests_valid_choicefst-promotion_steprespect-access- jpeg- schem funcstatementinfo/order-step-wise=E bonjourkid20",

        " \nWhen you add complex numbers, you add the real numbers (the numbers without $i$), and you add the imaginary numbers (the numbers with $i$). So, for the real parts:\n$ 508 + (-1322) = -814 $.\nFor the imaginary parts:\n$ 1749 + 1949 = 3698 $.\nThe sum is therefore $ (-814 + 3698)i = \\boxed{2884i} $.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2884i.

        " When adding the complex numbers $a+bi$ and $c+di$, we add the real parts by adding the real coefficients of the numbers and add the imaginary parts by adding the imaginary coefficients. Thus, we add $508$ and $-1322$ and add $1749$ and $1949$. The sum of the real parts is $508 - 1322 = -814$, and the sum of the imaginary parts is $1749 + 1949 = 3698$. Therefore, the sum of Kelly and Avril\u2019s numbers is $\\boxed{-814+3698i}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -814+3698i. I hope it is correct. ### Explanatory Solution: Given the complex numbers $a+bi=508+1749i$ and $c+di=-1322+1949i$, where $a, b, c, d$ are real numbers, we have to add them to find their sum. To add complex numbers, we add their real and imaginary parts separately. Therefore, their sum is represented as $$(a+c)+(b+d)i$$For the given numbers, we have $$a+c=508-1322=-814,$$and$$b+d=1749+1949=3698.$$Thus, their sum is$$-814+3698i = \\boxed{-814+3698i}.$$ Final Answer: The final answer is -814+3698i.

        " \nLet's break it down:\nKelly's number is represented as $a+bi$ where $a = 508$ and $b = 1749$.\nAvril's number is represented as $c+di$ where $c = -1322$ and $d = 1949$.\nTo add these complex numbers, we add the real parts (the $a$ and $c$ values) together and keep the imaginary parts (the $b$ and $d$ values) separate.\nSo, we have:\n$508 + 1749i + (-1322) + 1949i$\nNow, we combine like terms:\n$186 + 3038i$\nThe sum of Kelly and Avril's numbers is: $\\boxed{186 + 3038i}$",
