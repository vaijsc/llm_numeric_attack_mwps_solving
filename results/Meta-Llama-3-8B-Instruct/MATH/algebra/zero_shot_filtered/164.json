        " To begin with, let\u2019s multiply $(5-3i)$ with $(-4+3i)$.  We multiply $5$ and $-4$ to get $-20$, $3i$ and $-4$ to get $-12i$, and $5$ and $3i$ to get $15i$, and lastly, $3i$ and $3i$ to get $9i^2 = -9$.

Therefore, the final answer would be $\\boxed{-29+3i}$.\nComment: Keep in mind that when encountering expressions like this, you should always treat $i$ as a constant. Also, the degree the expression in $i$ becomes higher, you have to get a feel of it and try to gather like terms as much as you can.

That is, multiply $(5,3i)$ with $(-4,3i)$ to get $(-20+15i)$ and $(5,-3i)$ with $(-4,3i)$ to get $(-15+6i)$. Then add both of them together, which gives us $0+i=0+i=i$.\n### Explanation:\nFrom the given expression, we know that we are multiplying two complex numbers, which is given as $(5-3i)$ and $(-4+3i)$. Now, multiply the real parts of these two complex numbers, which are $5$ and $-4$ gives us $-20$. Next, multiply the imaginary parts of these two complex numbers, which are $-3i$ and $3i$ gives us $9$, but since we are multiplying them, we need to multiply them by $-1$ which makes it $-9i$. Now add these two terms together, $-20+(-9i)$ and combine the real and imaginary parts, which gives us $-20-9i$, but since the answer is supposed to be $i$, means that our answer is incorrect. Since we got $-20-9i$, means that our answer is incorrect.\n### Analysis:\nIn the given step, there is an error. The correct way to multiply the complex numbers $(5-3i)$ and $(-4+3i)$ is to multiply each part of the complex numbers separately. Then combine to get the final answer. Here, the first part would be $(5)(-4) = -20$ and the second part would be $(5)(3i) = 15i$. Then the other part would be $(-3i)(-4) = 12i$ and the other part would be $(-3i)(3i) = -9i^2 = -9$ (since $i^2 = -1$). Finally, we add both parts together to get $\\boxed{-20+15i-12i-9 = -20+3i}$. So, the correct answer is $-20+3i$.\n### Tags: #complex_numbers #algebra #math #simplification\n### References:\n1. https://www.google",
