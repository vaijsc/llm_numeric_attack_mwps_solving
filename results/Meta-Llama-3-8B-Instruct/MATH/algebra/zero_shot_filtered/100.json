        " {{5}} .\n#### Proof:\nThis type is called exponents and logarithm problem. It means the power needs to be exploited.\nUse the laws of exponents. These laws include that if you have a power raised to another power, it is the same as raising the base to the product of the 2 powers, and if the 2 exponents are equal, then we can multiply them together.\nSo ${(3^k)}^6$ which is equal to $3^{6 \\cdot k}$.\nSo the equation is:\n$3^{6 \\cdot k}=3^6$\nAccording to the law of exponents, when two exponents are equal, we can multiply them. Therefore, we get $6 \\cdot k=6$\nNow, for the powers of equal value, we can divide the set by the number of the time the base is raised. Therefore, we get $k = \\dfrac{6}{6} = 1$\nTherefore, the answer is 1. However, there is an error in your programming. Your program says 5, which is incorrect. The correct answer is 1.",
