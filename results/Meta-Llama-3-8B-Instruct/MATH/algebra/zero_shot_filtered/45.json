        " First we can simplify the expression in the parentheses: $$1+2i.$$ This combination of a real and imaginary number is called a complex number. Furthermore, we know the complex number has a modulus, say $r$. Here we have $r=\\sqrt{1^2+2^2}=\\sqrt{5}$.\nThe exponent component of it can be expressed by the second trigonometric value, say $\\theta$. In this case, $\\cos \\theta = \\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}$ $\\sin \\theta = \\dfrac{2}{\\sqrt{5}}$. Thus $\\theta=\\arctan2$.\n### Solution\nNote that in the expression $$(1+2i)6-3i,$$ the expression in the parentheses is a product between 6 and the complex number $1+2i$. This can be expanded using the distributive property:\n$$(1+2i)6-3i=6(1)+6(2i)-3i=6+12i-3i=6+9i.$$\nTherefore, the value of $(1+2i)6-3i$ is $\\boxed{6+9i}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 6+9i.

        " In order to evaluate this expression, we can perform the given operations in the order in which they occur: $(1+2i)6$ is the given expression we wish to evaluate. Multiplying the given expression and the scalar $6$ gives: $\\begin{array}{rcl}(1+2i)6&=&6+12i\\\\\\\\\\mbox{Then subtract $3i$ from the result.}&=&6+12i-3i\\\\\\\\&=&\\boxed{6+9i}\\end{array}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 6+9i. I hope it is correct.  Note: For such expressions, how may we be sure if the result is simplified?\u00a0 There are two conditions that tell us the result is simplified: Firstly, there are no coefficients in front of imaginary terms. Lastly, all the terms (both real and imaginary) are separate terms. If there are any remainders after calculations, it indicates that we should perform further calculations, which means we need to simplify further.  Hence, simplification is the process of putting this expression into the most straightforward form possible. When performing calculations, we should always check if our result meets these conditions: there are no coefficients in front of imaginary terms, and all the terms are separate terms.  There are two cases that will complicate our simplification:   - The presence of complex numbers (as the present problem):   - Coefficients before imaginary terms:          \\begin{array}{rcl}\n          (1+i)2 & = 2+2i \\\\\n          2(x-i) & = 2x-2i\n          \\end{array}     \\\\\\\\\nIf there are remainders or too many terms, this can indicate that further simplification is necessary. Finally, if there is any possible change, we test for the final validity of the expression. If not, then it stays simplified.          \\\\\\\\          \\\\\\  Therefore, when simplifying expressions, we should be sure if  1) the  result is simplified, have no coefficients in front of imaginary terms, and all the terms are separate terms. Otherwise, we should make simplifications further because the expression becomes simplified.          \\\\\\  For more such problems, refer to Calculus I-MAT 1343, Calculus II MAT 1344, Calculus III  MAT 2343 or any other related classes.          \\\\\\\\          \\\\ Final Answer: The final answer is 6",
        " $(1+2i)6-3i = (6 + 12i) - 3i = \\boxed{6 + 9i}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 6+9i. I hope it is correct.  We have multiplied $(1+2i)$ by $6$ first. Then we added the $-3i$ as the second term. Our expression can be written as $6+12i-3i = 6+12i - 3i = 6+9i$. Therefore, the result is $6+9i$. I hope it is correct.
