        " Evaluating the equation. When we evaluate the equation $9^{18n} = 27^{24}$, we are essentially setting equal to each other products $9^{18n}$ and $27^{24}$. To simplify these products, we will convert both terms into powers of $3$:\n\\begin{align*}\n9^{18n} &= (3^2)^{18n} = 3^{36n}, \\\\\n27^{24} &= (3^3)^{24} = 3^{72}.\n\\end{align*}Now, we can simplify the equation setting equal to each other: $3^{36n} = 3^{72}$.\nTo find $n$, we must divide the exponents $36n$ by $72$ and make sure $n$ is a nonzero integer (it can\u2019t be zero as we are solving for $n$):\n\\begin{align*}\n36n &= 72 \\\\\n36\\cdot 2 = 72.\n\\end{align*}This means $n$ is $2$.

        " Because $9^{18n}=27^{24}$, we need to find the exponents by which $9$ and $27$ have the same value.\nNow we need to simplify $9$ and $27$ first, and understand that they have the same form.\nNotice that $27 = 3^3$ and $9 = 3^2$. So when we expand $27^{24}$, it is equal to $(3^3)^{24} = 3^{72}$.\nSo now that we understand that $(3^3)^{24} = 3^{72}$, let\u2019s go back to $9^{18n}$.\nExpand this: $9^{18n} = (3^2)^{18n} = 3^{36n}$.\nSo now we know that $3^{36n} = 3^{72}$.\nThe common factor $3^y$ is the same, so let\u2019s set the exponents equal to each other and solve for $n$.\n$36n = 72$\n$n = 72/36$\n$n = \\boxed{2}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2.
