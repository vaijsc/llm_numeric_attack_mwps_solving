We know the sum of the two numbers is 12, so we write the equation:\nx + y = 12\nWe also know the product of the two numbers is 35, so we write the equation:\nxy = 35\nNow, we can rewrite the first equation as:\ny = 12 - x\nNow, substitute this into the second equation:\nx(12 - x) = 35\nSimplify the equation:\n12x - x^2 - 35 = 0\nRearrange the equation:\nx^2 - 12x + 35 = 0\nFactor the equation:\n(x - 5)(x - 7) = 0\nThis gives us the solutions:\nx = 5, x = 7\nSo, the numbers are 5 and 7.

What is the positive difference between the numbers?**\nBy definition of multiplication, we know $a * b = 35$, where $a$ and $b$ are the two numbers. Similarly, we also know $a + b = 12$ since the sum is 12.\nWe can solve this system of equations easily: \nLet's define $a$ and $b$ to be the two numbers. Then the system of equations we are given is\n$a + b = 12$ (equation 1)\n$a * b = 35$ (equation 2)\nWe can solve for the values of $a$ and $b$ easily by substituting equation 1 into equation 2.\nSubstituting $b = 12 - a$ into equation 2, we get $a * (12 - a) = 35$\nExpanding the equation, we get:\n$12a - a^2 - 35 = 0$\nNext, we can add 35 to both sides to get $12a - a^2 = 35$\nNow we can factoring the quadratic equation:\n$a^2 - 12a + 35 = (a - 7)(a - 5) = 0$\nNext, we can factor and solve:\n$(a - 7)(a - 5) = 0$\n$a = 7 or a = 5$\nHowever, we know that $a$ and $b$ are the two numbers, and in fact, one must be greater than the other. This means we can ignore the solution where both are equal since that would mean $a = b = 0$ which does not make sense.\nSince we have two cases $a = 7$ and $a = 5$, we can use the system to solve for $b$ in each case:\n$a = 7$ => $b = 12 - a = 12 - 7 = 5$\n$a",

Now, we can find `x`:\n  `x = 12 - y`\n  `x = 12 - 7`\n  `x = 5`\nNow we have `x` and `y`, and we can find their positive difference:\n  `x - y = 5 - 7`\n  `x - y = -2`\nBut since the problem asked for the positive difference, we took the positive sign:\n  `x - y = 2`\nOur final answer is: 2.

        " \nWe can represent this problem as follows:\nLet the two numbers be a and b.

This can also be written as (a+b)(1+b).\nHence, we have:\n(a + b) (1 + b) = 47\nOr (a + b)^2 = 47 (1 + b) by expanding the bracket.\nNow, we know that (a + b)^2 is equal to (12)^2.\n12^2 = 144 and (1 + b) = 47/144.\nTo find the value of b, we can use the quadratic formula to solve for (1 + b).\n(1 + b) = 47/144 = 47/144 = (1 \u00b1 sqrt(-48)) / 12.\nThese values of b are not real numbers as we are looking for the difference between two numbers and not a complex number. Therefore, we reject these values and instead find the value of a.\nWe know that a + b = 12.\nSo, (12 \u2013 b) = 12.\n12 \u2013 b = 12\nb = 0\nSo, we have found that b = 0.\nNow, we need to find a:\nWe have a + 0 = 12\na = 12\nSo, the two numbers are 0 and 12.\nThe positive difference between these two numbers is 12 \u2013 0 = 12.",

But we can from the second. Since we know that a + b = 12, we can expand the second equation to get:\na \u00d7 b = (a + b) \u00d7 (b - a)\nor:\n35 = (a + b) \u00d7 (b - a)\nSubstituting 12 for (a + b), we get:\n35 = 12 \u00d7 (b - a)\nNow, we can simplify:\n35 = 12b - 12a\nNow, we can isolate b:\n12b = 35 + 12a\nNow, we can solve for b:\nb = 35 + 12a / 12\nor:\nb = (35 + 12a) / 12\nNow, we can find a:\n12a = 12b - 35\na = (12b - 35) / 12\nNow, we can write both numbers using formulas:\na = (12b - 35) / 12\nb = (35 + 12a) / 12\nNow, we can find the positive difference between the numbers.

We can do that by making sure that we always have the biggest number minus the smaller number.\nSince we can have either a or b as the bigger number, let\u2019s try both:\na = (12b - 35) / 12\nb = (35 + 12a) / 12\nWhen a is the bigger number:\nb = 12b / 12 - 35 / 12\nb = b - 35 / 12\nThis isn\u2019t necessarily the case, so let\u2019s try b as the bigger number:\na = 12b - 35\na = b - 35\nThis is the case since 35 is less than 12b, so this is the scenario we will use. Now, we can find the positive difference:\n|a - b| = |b - 35 - b| = |35| = 35\nSo, the positive difference between the numbers is 35.",
