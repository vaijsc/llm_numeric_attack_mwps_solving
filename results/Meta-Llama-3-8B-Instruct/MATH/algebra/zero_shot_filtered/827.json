As you continue your studies in physics and chemistry, you will learn that conversions are a crucial part of working with mass.\nThe concept of mass is maybe not as simple to grasp as you might have thought, but the fundamental idea is straightforward: mass is a measure of the amount of matter in an object. Withthis understanding, you will be able to tackle the questions on this test and even find them a breeze.",

        " To evaluate this expression, let\u2019s consider each part of it separately.  The expression $\\lceil x \\rceil$ is the ceiling of $x$, which is the least integer that is greater than or equal to $x$.  So, for example, $\\lceil 8 \\rceil = 8$ since 8 is the least integer greater than or equal to 8, while $\\lceil 8.1 \\rceil = 9$ since 9 is the least integer greater than or equal to 8.1.  By the definition of ceiling, we have:\n$$8.8 \\leq \\lceil 8.8 \\rceil < 9.0\\quad\\text{and}\\quad-8.8\\leq \\lceil -8.8 \\rceil < -8.7.$$Using this, we can say that $\\lceil 8.8 \\rceil = \\boxed{9}$ and $\\lceil -8.8 \\rceil = \\boxed{-8}$.
