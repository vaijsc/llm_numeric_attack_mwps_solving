        " The key idea here is to get $9x^2 + 18x + 7$ written in terms of $(x + a)^2$ to complete the square. To do this, we need to identify what multiple of $x$ (the linear term) we need to $pull$ out and what number we need to add to complete the square.\nLet\u2019s find that multiple and number.\nNote that the coefficient of $x^2$ is $9$, so we can extract $\\frac{18}{2\\times 9} = 1$ from it.\nThen, the expression $9x^2 + 18x + 7$ becomes $9(x^2 + 2x + \u2026) + 7$, with the remaining part to be completed.\nNow, we know that the sum of $x^2 + 2x + 1 = (x + 1)^2$.

        " \nTo find the minimum value of the given expression, we first rewrite it into the form $a(x-h)^2 + k$.\nThis lets us apply a technique called vertex form, which directly gives us the minimum value. To do this, we complete the square.\n$$9x^2 + 18x + 7 = 9(x^2 + 2x) + 7 = 9(x^2 + 2x + 1) - 9 + 7 = 9(x+1)^2 - 2$$Notice how we added $1$ inside the square to isolate the coefficient of the term in front of the $x$. Now, let\u2019s recall that $a(x-h)^2 + k$ is minimized when $x = h$, because $a$ can either be positive or negative.\nIf $a > 0$, the expression is minimized when $a(x-h)^2 + k$ is minimized, which is when $x = h$.\nIf $a < 0$, the expression is maximized when $a(x-h)^2 + k$ is maximized, which is when $x = h$.\nWe can try to apply the same logic here, where $a = 9, k = -2$, and $h?$ We are not given any specific values, but we know that $h$ is the value that minimizes the expression.\nSo, we are not given any specific other values, but we know that $h$ is the value that minimizes the expression.\nAs stated, the minimum value of this expression is given when $x = h$.\nWorking back in time from $a(x-h)^2 + k = 9(x+1)^2 - 2$, we can figure out that $h = -1$.\nWe are looking for $x$, not $h$, so, don\u2019t get confused.\nSo we must find $x$ that satisfies $x = h$ which is in this instance, $x = -1$.\nThis is where I have stopped with my efforts. The expected  answer seems to be -1/3.\nHowever, it is not the most clear solution. Sometimes I may get confused that this expression does not look like a parabola and I may need to answer by referring to its vertex form.\nFinally, in this case, I will point out that this expression is of the form $AT^2 + BT + C$, where $A$ is a positive real number",

I hope it is correct. Suppose $f(x) = 9x^2 + 18x + 7$. Since $f^{\\prime\\prime}(x) = 18 > 0$, $f(x)$ is a convex upwards function, so its minimum value will occur at a point $x$ where $f^{\\prime}(x) = 0$.\n$$f^{\\prime}(x) = 18x + 18 = 0 \\Rightarrow 18(x + 1) = 0$$\n$$\\Rightarrow x + 1 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = \\boxed{-1}.$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -1. I hope it is correct. $\\boxed{x = -1}$ yields the minimum value. Therefore, to get the minimum value, we need to put $x = -1$, which means the value of $x$ is $\\boxed{-1}$.\nWe have a quadratic polynomial, and we want to find the point where it has a minimum value. By completing the square, we get $9x^2 + 18x + 7 = 9(x + 1)^2 + 2$. Since there is no linear term in the right hand side, we know that the point where this expression is smallest is where $x + 1 = 0$, which in other words means we want $x = \\boxed{-1}$.\nFor a quadratic polynomial $ax^2 + bx + c$, the vertex is given by $$x = -\\frac{b}{2a}.$$ For our polynomial, this means we have $x = \\boxed{-\\frac{b}{2a}}$, $\\boxed{x = -\\frac{b}{2a}}$, and $\\boxed{x = -1}$.\nWe have a quadratic polynomial, and we",
