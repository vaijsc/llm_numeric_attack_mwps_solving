I hope it is correct.\u00b6\n### How can I use the power rule to calculate f(g(2))?\u00b6\nYou can't directly apply the power rule to this problem. The function $f(x)$ is not a polynomial in $x$, so the power rule doesn't apply.\nInstead, you need to evaluate $g(2)$ first, which I did in my previous response: $g(2) = 2^2 + 3 = 7$.\nThen, you can replace $x$ by 7 in $f(x)=2x-4$ and evaluate the expression $f(x)$ at $x=7$.\nThe power rule is used for differentiating polynomial functions, not for evaluating composite functions like this. You can't use the power rule here.\u00b6\n### How can you simplify f(g(2))?\u00b6\nIf you look at the definition of $g(x)$ and $f(x)$, you can simplify $f(g(2))$ without evaluating $g(2)$ first.\n$$f(g(x)) = 2(x^2 + 3) - 4$$ $$= 2x^2 + 6 - 4 = 2x^2 + 2$$\nSo, $$f(g(x)) = 2x^2 + 2$$\nNow, if you want to know $f(g(2))$ you just need to replace $x$ with $2$ in the expression $2x^2 + 2$. This gives you $f(g(2)) = 2 \\cdot 2^2 + 2 = 2 \\cdot 4 + 2 = 8 + 2 = 10$. So, the simplified expression is $2x^2 + 2$ and when you evaluate it at $x=2$ you get $10$.\u00b6",

In the game, players open a set of cards and try to find all the pairs.\nIf a player finds a pair, they gain 1 point. But they could have done better. There are 5 cards in the set that have the same word but the card is flipped over. (So, for each player, there is a 80% chance of getting at least one of these cards giving them a pair.)\nIf a player finds all 5 pairs (5 cards are flipped over), they gain 5 points. If a player finds 4 pairs (4 cards are flipped over), they gain 4 points, and so on. There is a 20% chance that a player will not get any of these 5 cards. That means a 0 point score.\n### How do I calculate the probability of gaining points in this game?\nTo solve this problem, we have to understand how probability works. We will make a tree and try to calculate the different branches and probabilities along the way. Let's start.\nThe first step is to find the probability of gaining 0 points which means we have to flip all 5 cards over. We are guessing that there is a 20% chance that this happens. This is the base case for this problem. The probability tree: Branch 1: The 5 cards are flipped over\nProbability = (0.20) = 0.2\nWe start from here. Branch 2: The first card is chosen. Flip probability = 0.8 and no flip probability = 0.2\nBranch 3: The second card is chosen. Flip probability = 0.8 and no flip probability = 0.2\nBranch 4: The third card is chosen. Flip probability = 0.8 and no flip probability = 0.2\nBranch 5: The fourth card is chosen. Flip probability = 0.8 and no flip probability = 0.2\nBranch 6: The fifth card is chosen",
