        " $x^{2}+\\frac{1}{x^{2}}+1 = \\boxed{49}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 49. I hope it is correct.  The idea here is to use an algebraic manipulation to solve it. Start by the hint above.  In this problem ,we are given that s=x+1/x , now we try to get that expression  in terms of x^2 and 1/x^2.\n### Alternate response: So, each side is expressed in terms of $x^2$ and $\\frac{1}{x^2}$. First, we find the unexpanded equivalent expression of the given expression, that is $x+\\frac{1}{x}$. <br>\nNow, we know that $x$ and $\\frac{1}{x}$ is always equal to the square root $\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{x^2}}$ and $\\sqrt{x^2}$, then we find the square of $x$ and $\\frac{1}{x}$. \\newline\n Example: Let us assume that $x=2$, then $\\frac{1}{x}=0.5$, so $x+\\frac{1}{x}=2.5$, now this implies that the square root $\\sqrt{x^2+(\\frac{1}{x})^2}=2.5$.  This is equal to $x^2+\\frac{1}{x^2}+2.5$.  Now the last term is canceled by the last term of what we get above, so we get that $x^2+\\frac{1}{x^2}=49$. <br>\n Therefore, $x^{2} + \\frac{1}{x^{2}} + 1$ is $49$. <br>\n Thus, the solution is $49$.\n### Final Answer: The final answer is 49. I hope it is correct.  When \\[x+\\frac{1}{x}=7,\\] we have $\\begin{bmatrix}x^2 & \\frac{1}{x}\\\\x & \\dfrac{1}{x}\\end{bmatrix}$ equals $\\begin{bmatrix}7 & 1\\\\1 & 7\\end{bmatrix}$, which is the square of the matrix $\\begin{bmatrix}3\\\\1\\end{bmatrix}$. Therefore $x^2$ and $\\frac{1}{x^2}$ sum to $3",
        " Define\n$$X= x + \\frac{1}{x}$$\n### Step 1\nUsing X we simplify the expression:\n$X^2 = (x+\\frac{1}{x})^2 = x^2 + \\frac{1}{x^2} + 2x\\frac{1}{x}$\n### Step 2\nNow simplifying it by noticing that $x + \\frac{1}{x} = 7$, we get:\n$X^2 = (x + \\frac{1}{x})^2 = 7^2 = 49$\n### Step 3\nNow, applying $x + \\frac{1}{x} = 7$, to the equation of the expression:\n$x^2 + \\frac{1}{x^2} = X^2 - 2$\n### Step 4\nReplacing X^2 with 49:\n$x^2 + \\frac{1}{x^2} = 49 - 2 = 47$\n### Step 5\nThe final step is to simplify the expression by adding 1:\n$x^2 + \\frac{1}{x^2} + 1 = 47 + 1 = 48$\n### Final Answer: The final answer is 48.

It covers quadratic equations of the form ax^2 + bx + c, where a is non-zero. If you are ready to learn more about FOIL Method, then let\u2019s dive into the lesson. To use the FOIL Method to solve quadratic equations, we have to expand the expression (x + y)^2, where x and y are polynomials. The FOIL Method is an abbreviation for the words First, Outer, Inner, Last. It is a shortcut for using the distributive property to expand the expression. Here\u2019s the step-by-step process for expanding the expression:\n1. First: Multiply the First terms of the two polynomials. In this case, we multiply the First term of the first polynomial (x) with the First term of the second polynomial (y). This gives us x * y.\n2. Outer: Multiply the Outer terms of the two polynomials. In this case, we multiply the Outer term of the first polynomial (x) with the Outer term of the second polynomial (y). This gives us xy.\n3. Inner: Multiply the Inner terms of the two polynomials. In this case, we multiply the Inner term of the first polynomial (y) with the Inner term of the second polynomial (x). This gives us y",

        " \nStarting with the given formula, we can rewrite it as $x^{2}+7x+\\frac{1}{x}=7$. Then we can subtract 1 from both sides of the equation to obtain $(x+\\frac{1}{x})^{2}=7^{2}$. The expression on the left side of this equation is $(x+\\frac{1}{x})^{2}=7^{2}$.\n### Solution:\nWe can rewrite the expression in a new and interesting form! We have that $x^{2} + \\frac{1}{x^{2}} + 1 = (x+\\frac{1}{x})^{2} + (1 - 1) = (7)^{2} = 49$.\n### Answer: 49\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 49. I hope it is correct. | |\n### Discussion:\nThe approach that you can take on this is very important for the reason that this problem asks for the value of $x^{2}+\\frac{1}{x^{2}} + 1$. It\u2019s simple! So, what it takes is just a little bit of \u2026",
        " \nWe know that $x+\\frac{1}{x}=7$, so $x^{2}+\\frac{1}{x^{2}} + 2 = 49$, and $x^{2}+\\frac{1}{x^{2}} + 1 = \\boxed{49-2 = 47}$.\nWhy is the answer correct? I do not really understand this question, please explain. I mean, we do not know the final answer, so we do not know how we get the answer. How do you know that $(x^{2} + \\frac{1}{x^{2}} +2) = 49$? Because of the quadratic formula, you calculate it using this formula. And if you have $a ?  let\u2019s say $b$, and you get $b = a^{2} + 2/a^{2}$, then you get $x = b + 1/a$. Why ? So we said earlier $(x^{2} + \\frac{1}{x^{2}} +2) = 49$. But how we get the answer, it\u2019s unknown to us, because it is a general question.",
        " 16\nGiven that $x+\\frac{1}{x}=7$\nPlug in 1 to the right hand side: $1 + \\frac{1}{1} = 2$\nPlug in 7 to the left hand side:\n$7 + \\frac{1}{7} = 7 + \\frac{1}{7} = 12/7$ Check the sum.

I hope it is correct.",
        " \nSince $x+\\frac{1}{x}=7$, we have $x^{2}-7x+\\frac{1}{x^{2}}=-1$, so, we need to compute $(x^{2}+\\frac{1}{x^{2}})+1$ first. Plugging in $x^{2}+\\frac{1}{x^{2}}=y$ we get $y+1=x^{2}-7x+\\frac{1}{x^{2}}-1 \\Leftrightarrow y+1=-1 \\Leftrightarrow y=-2$. Thus, we can express our initial expression as $(x^{2}+\\frac{1}{x^{2}})+1=-2+1=\\boxed{-1}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -1. I hope it is correct. "
