    "solution": "Because the question only asks for the value of $m$, we can begin by eliminating $n$. In order to do this, we multiply the second equation by 4, giving us a system of two equations where both coefficients of $n$ are 4: \\begin{align*} 3m+4n=47\n\\\\ 4m+4n=60\n\\end{align*}From here, we can just subtract the second equation from the first. This gives us $(3m+4n)-(4m+4n)=47-60$, which simplifies to $-m=-13$ or $m=\\boxed{13}$.",

I hope it is correct.  Final Answer: The final answer is m=0. I hope it is correct.\nHere is the reason why I believe that $m=0$ is the solution.\nLet's try $m=1$. Since $n=15-m=15-1=14$, $3m+4n=3+4\\cdot14=58$, and the given equation $3m+4n=47$ is not satisfied.\nThe solution set for any other value of $m$ would be more complicated than just that value itself, and it is unlikely that there are many solutions.  So, the only reasonable solution is $m=0$.\nYou can also verify that $n=15$ is a valid solution by noting that $n=15$ should result in $m=15-n=15-15=0$, and indeed, $3m+4n=3(0)+4(15)=0+60=60\\neq47$, so the point $m=0$ is an extraneous solution.\n### Clarify: \nIt seems that there is some confusion about the problem.  The problem statement is unclear: it says \"what is $m$?\" but it assumes that $m$ and $n",

        " \nIf we added $m+n=15$ to our given equation $3m+4n=47$, we will have\n$$3m+4n+m+n=47+15$$ which is equal to $$4m+5n=62.$$ Now, subtract $m+n=15$ from both sides, which gives\n$$(4m+5n)-(m+n)=62-15,$$ which is equal to $$3m+4n=47.$$ This gives us the identity or a condition that can be manipulated. There seems to us, then no left choice than to find the relationship between $m$ and $n$, or say, who\u2019s friend. If we recognize the fact that the equation $4m+5n=62$ can be written as\n$$n=\\frac{62-4m}{5},$$ we will know $n$ with respect to $m.$ Plugging back to our main condition $m+n=15$, we will denote it by $LHS$.\n$$LHS\\equiv m+\\frac{62-4m}{5}=15.$$ From which we can manipulate $m$ to isolate.

Now that we have the equation for $n$ in terms of $m$ (up to a small bit of manipulation), plug it back into our other equation:\n$$3m+4n=47$$\n$$3m+4(15-m)=47$$\n$$3m+60-4m=47$$\n$$-m+60=47$$\n$$-m=47-60$$\n$$-m=-13$$\n3. Now that we have the answer for $-m$, we can find the original $m$ by just reversing the sign.\n$$m=\\boxed{13}$$\n### Explanation: \nWe first rearrange the given equation $m+n=15$ to have $n$ expressed in terms of $m$.  Then we substitute this into the second equation, $3m+4n=47$, which allows us to solve for $m$.  This yields $m=13$.

There is definitely a similarity between this question and the techniques used to solve a linear system of equations.\nThis kind of problem is a fundamental problem of linear algebra and these are the types of problems that we do with linear algebra. Linear algebra is a big area of study in mathematics and computer science that is used widely in many areas like physics, engineering, computer science and many other fields.\nThe basic difference between this kind of problem and systems of linear equations is the level of complexity of the problem and the methods used to solve them. Systems of linear equations are typically solved using matrices, determinants and whatnot whereas the problem you solved used substitutions.  And it's also worth noting that solving linear systems and non-linear systems  are also often done using linear algebra techniques.\nDo you have any other questions?

        " Start with $$3m+4n=47.$$ We can rewrite this equation as $$3(m+n)+n=47$$ since $3m+4n = 3m + 3n + n = 3(m+n) + n$.
