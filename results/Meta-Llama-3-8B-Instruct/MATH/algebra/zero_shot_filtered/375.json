        " Let's break it down step by step. First, we find out $g(1)$. From the graph, we see that $g(1)$ is at $1$. Since $g(x) = 2x - 4$, we can evaluate $g(1)$ as \\begin{align*}g(1) &= 2 \\cdot 1 - 4 \\\\&= 2 - 4 \\\\&= -2.\\end{align*}Now, we find $f(g(1))$. Since $g(1) = -2$, we know that $f(g(1)) = f(-2)$.
