        " To get the quadratic $3x^2-24x+72$ into the form $a(x+b)^2+c$, we need to complete the square. Note that the given quadratic has the form $3x^2-24x+72=(3x^2-24x)+72$, so it seems natural to try completing the square with respect to $x^2$, rather than with respect to $x$. Also, we can recall some general steps to complete the square: 1. write the quadratic in the form $ax^2+bx+c$, and 2. divide both sides by $a$. In our case, we can work on both steps at once by factoring out the leading coefficient $3$: \\begin{align*}\n3x^2-24x+72 &= 3(x^2-8x)+72 \\\\\n&= 3(x^2-8x+16)-48+72 \\\\\n&= 3(x-4)^2+24.\n\\end{align*}This shows that the equation we were looking for is $a(x+b)^2+c$ with $a=3$, $b=-4$, and $c=24$.
