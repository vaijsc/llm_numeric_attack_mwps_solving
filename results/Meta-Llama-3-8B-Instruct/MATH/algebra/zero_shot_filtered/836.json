I hope it is correct.amanuktamil :) I was wondering if we should provide a hint for accruacy. Knowing the discriminant always means knowing when the interval of solution is either all real, one real, or no real solutions. Perhaps adding something like \"does the interval of solutions have only real solutions or no real solutions then use context clues in the problem to determine the reasonable distracter choice thus providing a reason for the discriminant/m\" . amanuktamil :) They may also want to add that when we see problems like quadratic functions whose discriminant is negative, we can always assure they never have real solutions, thanks for the feedback. I hope this helps make our response more detailed. To be honest, we did not account for that. Let me think. We could cover it in a thing, where we have to explain when you get the quadratic formula are going to have real or no real solutions, but I is also worthy of a sentence, again amanuktamil :) By contrast, if the discriminant is zero, that means $ab = c^2$, and there is only one real solution. Therefore, a quadratic function whose discriminant is zero will always have one real solution. That the quadratic formula output is a zero! In contrast, when the discriminant is positive, it means there are two distinct real solutions. This idea seems like similar things because when you multiply it out with the quadratic formula, it has to be two or one real solutions always! So, a quadratic function whose discriminant is positive will always have real solutions, and that they are distinct if $d > 0$.

Yeah, the discriminant is definitely a crucial concept in the world of quadratic equations! So, what do you want to know about it? Should I give you a rundown of the formula or perhaps an explanation of what it reveals?\nby no means. There can be no positive values when the expression is strictly negative.\nYou are correct that quadratic expressions can be rewritten as the product of two linear factors, each having the form $ax+b$ and being a factor of the expression. This decomposition is well-defined only for quadratic expressions with roots (and only real roots). Concentrate on the roots and avoid constants, even if they are real.\nDo you remember the statement about the quadratic formula that one equation alone can always be represented by the formula?\nNow you can enter some information into your calculator, depending on the values you entered, and determine whether they can be represented by a quadratic equation or not. Try to change the y-value slightly and see if you get an exact same thing.\nIn the case of a different coefficient, we might have another quadratic equation. 0 will always appear in the middle. \nHere",
