        " It is given that $x=\\log_{\\sqrt[3]{5}}125$.\nWe know that $125=\\left(\\sqrt[3]{5}\\right)^{3 \\cdot 5}.$We use this information to write $$x=\\log_{\\sqrt[3]{5}}125=\\log_{\\sqrt[3]{5}} \\left(\\sqrt[3]{5}\\right)^{3 \\cdot 5}.$$We also know that $f(a,b)=a^b$, so $$x=\\log_{\\sqrt[3]{5}}\\left(\\sqrt[3]{5}\\right)^{\\color{red}{}}=3 \\cdot 5$$And because the base, $\\sqrt[3]{5},$ is positive, the result is positive so $\\boxed{3 \\cdot 5=15}$.\n## Video\nLink: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQWoVSSnsIw\n### Note\nIt seems to be very important to remember the concept of the logarithm. The function $f(a,b)$ means $b^a$, which means $a$ is raised to the power of $b$. So, in this problem the $\\log_{\\sqrt[3]{5}}125$ means 125 raised to the power of the logarithm. This means that we need to keep in mind the base of the logarithm, which is $\\sqrt[3]{5}$, when solving for the problem.\n### More Problems\nLink: https://www.artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/2021_AMC_12B_Problems",

I hope it is correct.Symfony to convert fractions and decimals 25 to a decimal percent. 25% = 0.25 Ratio: out of or per Every whole number that you see, like 25 always means 25 out of a 100. To make it a decimal just remove the denominator. Silly, right? Then multiply to make a decimal. 25 / 100 = 0.25 You can write this out and just count it! 25 / 100 is the same as 25, 22, 25 or 25 children out of 100 children.\n25% is another way to say 1/4. Now 1 divided by 4 is.25, a decimal!\n25% is the same as.25 Sometimes you see a percent sign % after a whole number, like 25%. The % sign just means times. So 25% is the same as 25 times. You can multiply.25 by 100 to get 25.\nJust put the % sign after a decimal, like.2500.
