Dividing both sides by $2^x$, we get $2=2^{x-6}$.\n$r^a=r^b$ if and only if $a=b$, $r^a=r^{a+b}$ if and only if $a=b$.\nso, $x-6=1$, $x=6+y$.\nThe second equation is $8^{3y}=16^{-y+13}$.\nDividing left an right by $8^y$.\n$8^{2y}=16^{6-y}$.\nSince $8^2=16$, $8^{2y}=8^{6-y}$, $2y=6-y$ or $y=3$.\nApplying this to the first equation, we have $x=6+3=9$.\nSo, $x+y=9+3=\\boxed{12}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 12.

        " \nFirst, we can simplify the exponential equation $2^{x+1}=4^{x-7}$ by using the fact that $4^{n}=(2^{2})^{n}=2^{2n}$. This gives $2^{x+1}=2^{2x-14}$. Since both sides represent bases of exponential functions with the same base, we equate their exponents to conclude that $x+1=2x-14$. Solving for $x$, we get $\\boxed{x=7}$.\nNow let\u2019s solve $8^{3y}=16^{-y+13}$ by again simplifying the exponential equation using the facts that $8=2^{3}$ and $16=2^{4}$.
