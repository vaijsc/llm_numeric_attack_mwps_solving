    "solution": "We begin by completing the square for $a^2 + 6a - 7.$ We know that the binomial to be squared will be in terms of $a+b$ because the exponent for $a^2$ is 1.\n\nBy expanding $(a+b)^2$, we get $a^2+2ba+b^2$. We get that $2ba=6a$, so $b=3$, and it follows that $(a+3)^2=a^2+6a+9$.\n\nTherefore, $a^2+6a-7=a^2+6a+9-16=(a+3)^2-16$. Since the square of a real number is at least zero, the minimum value of $a^2+6a-7$ is $0-16=\\boxed{-16}$.",

        " The minimum value of a quadratic function of the form $ax^2+bx+c$ can be found by completing the square. Since the given expression is $a^2+6a-7$, we want to get it into the form $a^2+6a+?$. This means we will be adding 9 to the expression. To do this, we first change the $-7$ to $+2$ and then factor out a 1 from the left side:\n\\begin{align*}\na^2+6a-7=a^2+6a+2-9\\\\\n=(a+3)^2-9\n\\end{align*}Now that we have the expression in the form $(a+b)^2\\pm c$, we know that the value $(a+b)^2$ will always be at least $c$, and the expression will be smallest when the value $(a+b)^2$ equals $c$. In this case, the value $(a+b)^2$ equals $9$, so the smallest possible value of this expression is $9-9=\\boxed{-7}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -7. I hope it is correct.

        " Well let\u2019s rewrite this expression as $(a+7)(a-1)$\nThat didn\u2019t help. Let\u2019s forget about that. \n### What should we do now?\nLet\u2019s try completing the square. We have $a^2+6a-7$, so we can write it as $a^2+6a+9-16$. Now we can write $a^2+6a= (a+3)^2-9$, which gives us $(a+3)^2 -16$. The minimum value of the expression $x^2$ is -0, which happens when $x=0$. So the minimum value of $(a+3)^2$ is 0, which happens when $a+3=0$, or when $a=-3$. Thus we have $(a+3)^2-16=9-16=-7$, which means that the minimum value of $a^2+6a-7$ is $\\boxed{-7}$.\nStudents are asked to find the minimum value of a polynomial expression. This type of problem requires them to apply mathematical techniques such as completing the square or factoring. In this problem, the teacher encourages the student to think creatively and explore different approaches. The student applies the technique of completing the square and successfully finds the minimum value of the expression. The teacher provides feedback in a step-by-step manner, highlighting the student's thinking and providing guidance where necessary. Overall, this problem promotes mathematical reasoning and problem-solving skills.",

        " Notice that $a^2+6a-7=(a+7)(a-1)$.\nWe can use the concept of a quadratic expression to factor this quadratic expression to find its factors. There are several methods you can use to do this, such as factoring by grouping, factorising by splitting the middle term, and others. For this question, let us factorize it by splitting the middle term.\nFactoring out $a$ from the first two terms, we get $(a+7)(a-1)$.\nFor now, let's not worry about values of $a$ that make these factors zero.\nLet's focus on the minimum value of a quadratic expression like this.\nTo find the minimum value, we can either change only the signs of the factors or untie them and look at the points where they intersect.\nTo use the first approach, notice that $(a+7)(a-1)$ is positive when both the numbers are positive or both are negative.\nWhen either factors is zero, the product becomes zero.\nBy solving the factors of $0$ for $a$, we can figure out for which values of $a$, the factors become zero.\n\\begin{align*}\na+7&=0\\quad\\text{(from the first factor } a+7\\text{)}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad a&=-7\n\\end{align*}\\begin{align*}\na-1&=0\\quad\\text{(from the second factor } a-1\\text{)}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad a&=1\n\\end{align*}\nA quadratic expression of the form $f(x)=x^2$ has a minimum at $x=0$. $f(x) <= 0$ for the points $a=-\\sqrt{d}$ or $a=\\sqrt{d}$ where $d$ is the constant term of the quadratic expression and $a$ is a value that makes the expression zero when multiplied by a coefficient.\nUsing the points where the expression becomes zero, we can find the minimum value for our quadratic expression $a^2+6a-7$. Let's write it as $f(x)=x^2$.\nHere, $f(0)=0$ and $f(1)=0$ as well. $f(x)=x^2$ will always reach its highest point in these terms. So, it is $a=1...$\n(a= -sqrt(d) or a =",
        " Set $f(x) = a^2 + 6a - 7$, let\u2019s try to think where is the minimum point?\n$Now, we know that the minimum value of the parabola is at $x = - \\frac{b}{2a}$.$Here we have $a = 1$, and $b = 6 = 2(3)$, so, $x = \\frac{3}{1} = 3$. \n### Let\u2019s see what happens when $x=3$.\nSince $x=3$, we know that $f(3) = a^2+6a-7$.\nTo find $f(3)$, we plug $x=3$ to the equation:\n\\begin{align*}f(3) &= 3^2 + 6(3) - 7 \\\\&=9+18-7 \\\\&=20.\\end{align*} \n### Finally, the minimum value of the expression $a^2 + 6a - 7$ is $\\boxed{20}$. \nFinal Answer: The final answer is 20.

        " First, I would distribute 6 to the a. This gives me $a^2+6a-7=a^2+6a-49+42=a^2+6a+42-49=(a+3)^2-49$, which tells us that the value of a has no impact on the value of this expression as long as a is bounded. Second, I would figure out what happens when the expression is maximum, and what happens when it is minimum.\nThis tells us that the minimum value of the expression is when the $(a+3)^2$ term is at its smallest, which is 0, since it is a square. Since a can be any number, the smallest the value of (a+3)^2 can be is 0, and the value of the expression is its smallest when (a+3)^2=0. Plugging this into the expression, I can determine the minimum value of $a^2+6a-7$, which I think is -49.",
