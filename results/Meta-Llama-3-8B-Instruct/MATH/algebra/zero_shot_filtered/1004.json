        " We know that this set is symmetric around $550$.  So if $a$ is any $odd$ $integer$ $in$ $this$ $set,$ then we know that $a+1$ is also an integer in this set.  Thus, instead of adding up all the integers in the set, we just need to find half the integers and double the sum.  To find the half sum, all we need to do is add up all the odd integers from $500$ to $549$.  Now, if $a$ is any such integer, then $a$ is of the form $500+2k+1$ for some integer $k$.  So, the sum of all these integers is:\n$$\\sum_{k=0}^{25}(500+2k+1)=1000+2\\sum_{k=0}^{25}k+26=1000+2\\cdot\\frac{26\\cdot 25}{2}+26=1000+650+26=1676.$$We now double this, getting the answer of $\\boxed{3352}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 3352.

        " \nTo solve this problem, we only have to think about the odd numbers. For example, 500 is even, 501 is odd, 502 is even, and so on. As we go up in numbers, we will see that there\u2019s an odd number for every other number. How do we know how many odd numbers we will see between 500 and 700? That\u2019s an easy problem. Split 700 into odd numbers: 501, 503, 505, \u2026, 699.\nThere are 100 of them (700 minus 501 divided by 2 is 100). Now how do we find their sum? If we take the first number 501 and the last number 699, the average is (501 + 699) / 2. Multiply by the number of numbers we have: (501 + 699) / 2 \\times 100 = \\boxed{100_000}. The answer is 100,000. \n### ",
        " Let\u2019s create a sequence of odd numbers $N$ such that $500 < N < 700$. The first term in the sequence would be $N_1 = 501$. The common difference between each term is $2$. Therefore, the sequence is $501, 503, 505, \\ldots, 697.$\n### To find the sum of this sequence, we use the formula $$\\sum_{i = 1}^{n} (a_1 + d(i - 1)) = n[(a_1 + a_n)/2]$$\nFirst, we calculate the number of terms in the sequence. We have $501 + 2(k - 1) = 697 \\Rightarrow k = 100.$ When $k = 100,$ we have $N = 701.$ But note that $N_1 = 501.$ Therefore, we need the sum of $99$ terms of the sequence. We now use the formula\n$$\\sum_{i = 1}^{99} (501 + 2(i - 1)) = 99[501 + 698]/2 = 99 \\cdot 1199/2 = \\boxed{59703}$$\n### Final Answer: The final answer is 59703.

        " We know that odd numbers have the form $2k+1$ for some integer $k$. The first odd number we are interested in is $2k+1=503$, so $k = 251$. The second odd number is $2k+1=507$, so $k = 252$. We see that there are $351 - 251 = 100$ odd numbers between 500 and 700 (although maybe not all of them are distinct). So, if we know how to compute $2k + 1$ when $k = 251$ and how to compute $2k + 1$ when $k = 351$, we will have computed the sum of all the odd integers between 500 and 700.\nWe will be able to do these computations using what we are given.

Also, we know that $251$ plus $n$ increases by $1$ each time $n$ increases by $1$, and we know that $351$ minus $n$ decreases by $1$ each time $n$ increases by $1$.

Then for the second part, divide 197 by 2 (since there is an equal number of odd integers above and below 503, which is the middle number in the sequence), so: 197 / 2 = 98. Therefore, there are a total of 98 odd numbers in this range: 503 to 699.\nThe middle number of the sum is 503.

Well, the smallest possible odd integer between $500$ and $700$ is $(500+1)=501$ and the largest possible odd integer between $500$ and $700$ is $699$.\nNow, we have to find how many odd integers there are in this range. The difference is $(699-501)=198$. But remember that $699$ is odd and $501$ is odd. Therefore, the difference between $700$ and $501$ is not an odd number. In fact,\n$$699=501+198,$$so we get $(198-1)+501=198$ as the actual difference between two consecutive odd integers. Thus there are $n = 99$ odd integers between $500$ and $700$.\nNow the problem is to find the sum of all the odd integers. Well, one common thing all the odd integers $(501, 503, 505, \\ldots, 697, 699)$ have in common is that they are all odd numbers. Therefore, we can subtract $501$ from every odd number to get a multiple of $2$ and then, add up all the resulting even numbers.

I hope it is correct. #### limited only to the odd\nIt\u2019s enough only to have in consideration the numbers of $500+2i=1,002,...$  Fixed this problem!\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 14,500. I hope it is correct. #### Continuing with this argument we always count only one value.\nWe are interested in odd numbers with possible increase $-k$. The total number of odd numbers from 500 to 700 is 99 if we let d be 2 if $D = 4$+, and so on, where k is 0. Hence to sum is 99 * \"|\" |did = 14,500.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 14,500. I hope it is correct."
