        " The equation is |x + 3| = 6. By definition, |x + 3| is the distance of x + 3 from the origin. So if we subtract or add 3 to get what is 6 away from the origin. So, we must have either x + 3 = 6 or x + 3 = -6. So, we have either x = 3 or x = -9. The difference between x = 3 and x = -9 is -9 - 3 = 6.\nTo see this in different steps, first of all, solve the equation |x + 3| = 6. Now, |x + 3| = 0 for x + 3 = 0 because the distance from 0 to 0 should be zero. So, |x + 3| = 0 gives x = -3. But, we need to consider the absolute value. So, it should hold for both positive and negative. |x + 3| = -x - 3 = 6 to have solutions. This equation gives x = -9 or x = 3 because we assume that x is real.  Substituting these in the absolute value equation, we get |x + 3| = 6 for both cases.\nNow, if we want to take the difference between the solutions, it would be 3 - (-9) = -9 + 3 = 6.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 6.

        " First, I will find the absolute value equation $|x + 3| = 6$.\nWhen solving absolute values, we have two cases: either $x + 3 \\ge 0$ or $x + 3 \\lt 0$. In the first case, we can write the equation as $x + 3 = 6$, which gives $x = 3$. And in the second case, we can write the equation as $-(x + 3) = 6$, which gives $x = -9$.\nSince $-9 \\lt 3$, the two solutions are $x = -9$ and $x = 3$. To find the positive difference, we calculate $|-9 - 3| = |-12| = 12$ and $|3 - 3| = |0| = 0$. Since $12 \\gt 0$, we have $\\boxed{12}$ as our answer.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 12.

        " First, we can approach this problem by adding or subtracting $3$ inside the absolute value.  It is crucial that, when we subtract, the term we are taking the absolute value of becomes negative.\nSince subtracting $3$ makes the expression negative, we can subtract $3$ inside the absolute value: \n$$|x + 3| = 6$$\n$$|x| = 6 - 3$$\n$$|x| = 3$$Now, we know that the absolute value represents the distance from $0$, which is $x$. So, we can find $x$ when we think about the two possible places $x$ could be. If the distance is positive, then $x$ lies between the $y$-intercept of the absolute value graph and the point $(0, 3)$. In this case, $x = 3$. Now, if it is negative, then $x$ lies to the left of the $y$-intercept. In this case, $x = -3$. We want the positive distance between them, so we take the difference: \n$$|-3 - 3| = 6$$\n$$6$$So, the positive solution is $\\boxed{6}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 6.

        " $|x + 3| = 6$\nTo solve this equation, you need to get $x$ all by itself.\n### Plugging In Numbers: \nWherever you see the absolute value symbol, you have to make use of its definition, which is\n   \\begin{align*}\n     |x|&=\\begin{cases}\n       x, &\\text{if }x \\geq 0\\\\\n       -x, &\\text{if }x < 0\n     \\end{cases}\n   \\end{align*}So, we will consider the two cases:\n   - $x+3\\geq0$, in which case $|x + 3| = x+3$.\n   - $x+3<0$, in which case $|x+3| = -(x+3) = -x-3$.\n### Case 1: x+3 \\geq 0\nIn this case, we will solve the equation $x+3=6$.  Subtracting 3 from both sides, we get $x=3$.  Since $x+3=6 \\geq 0$, $x=3$ satisfies the condition $x+3\\geq0$.\n### Case 2: x+3 < 0\nIn this case, we will solve the equation $-(x+3)=6$.  Subtracting 3 from both sides, we get $-x=9$.  Multiplying both sides by -1, we get $x=-9$.  Since $x+3<0 \\iff x < 3$, $x=-9$ satisfies the condition $x+3<0$.\n### Now Go Back to the Original Equation\nSince $|x+3| = x+3$ in the first case and $|x+3| = -x-3$ in the second case, we can write those two equations together as $|x + 3| = x+3$ or $|x + 3| = -x-3.$\nNow, to find the positive difference between the solutions, you can write $x=3-(-9) = 12$.\n### The Answer\nThe positive difference between the solutions is $\\boxed{12-3 = 9}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 9.
