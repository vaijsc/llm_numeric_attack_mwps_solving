There is a clue, a piece of torn fabric caught in a nearby window latch.\nShawn sees that the fabric is from a cloak, and thinks that it might be a clue from the victim. But Gus is skeptical: \"Shawn, what makes you think that?\" Shawn replies, \"Because it's a classic trope in whodunits. The killer leaves a red herring to throw off the detective.\"\nGus asks, \"Red herring?\" Shawn answers, \"A false clue, designed to distract the detective from the real culprit. Like the torn fabric is meant to make us think it's a random clue, but it's really a warning that the killer is watching.\"\nGus raises an eyebrow. \"That's a pretty far-fetched idea, Shawn. But what's the damage?\" Shawn thinks for a moment, then says, \"Well, if we assume that the killer is using a classic whodunit technique, our first assumption should be that it's not meant to be a real clue.\"\nGus nods. \"So what does that mean?\" Shawn replies, \"It means we should be looking for the real clue that it's meant to distract us from. Maybe there's another clue hidden in plain sight, something that's irrelevant to the fabric but could still lead us to the killer.\"\nGus thinks for a moment. \"But we still have to investigate the fabric, don't we?\" Shawn agrees, \"Yeah, but we should do it with a critical eye, think about what it's really telling us. Maybe it's not a clue at all, but a message meant to throw us off the scent.\"\nWhat is the best way to approach this mystery?\nA) Assume that the torn fabric is a red herring and carefully examine the surrounding area for other clues that the killer might have missed.\nB) Focus on the torn fabric as the key clue and try to figure out how it relates to the murder.\nC) Ignore the torn fabric and look for other potential clues in the mansion.\nD) Follow your gut instincts about what the torn fabric might be telling you.\nWhat is the best way to approach the mystery is option A) Assume that",
