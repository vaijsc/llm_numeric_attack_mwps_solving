I hope it is correct. THis is another method to solve it: We complete the squre for x and y:\n\\begin{align*}& x^2 + 8x + 16 + y^2 + 4y + c - 20 = 0 \\\\(x+4)^2+(y+2)^2+c-20=0\\end{align*}\nthen $(x+4)^2+(y+2)^2=20-c$\nTo get radius of 3, $20-c=3^2$, so c=4.

        " \\begin{align*}\nx^2 + 8x + y^2 + 4y + c = 0 \\quad&\\Rightarrow\\quad x^2 + 2\\cdot x \\cdot 4 + 4^2 + y^2 + 2\\cdot y \\cdot 2 + 2^2 + c = 4^2 + 2^2\\\\\n&\\Rightarrow\\quad (x+4)^2 + (y+2)^2 = 4^2 + 2^2 +c\\\\\n&\\Rightarrow\\quad r^2 = (4)^2 + (2)^2 + c = c + 20\\\\\n\\end{align*} We want the radius to be 3. So, equating $r^2$ to $3^2$ and then solving for $c$ yields \\begin{align*}\nc+20 &= 3^2\\\\\nc &=9\\\\\n\\end{align*} The solution is $c = \\boxed{9}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 9. I hope it is correct.terrorism_forensics_cyber_analysis_book.pdf ## C# Code Example\n```csharp\nusing System;\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        // Value of 'c'\n        double c = 9;\n        // Radius of the circle\n        double radius = 3;\n        // Calculate r^2\n        double rSquared = c + 20;\n        // Check if r^2 equals radius squared\n        if (rSquared == radius * radius)\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Value of 'c' is: \" + c);\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Value of 'c' is not correct.\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n## Python Code Example\n```python\n# Value of 'c'\nc = 9\n# Radius of the circle\nradius = 3\n# Calculate r^2\nr_squared = c + 20\n# Check if r^2 equals radius squared\nif r_squared == radius ** 2:\n    print(\"Value of 'c' is:\", c)\nelse:\n    print(\"Value of 'c' is not correct.\")\n```\n## MATLAB Code Example\n```matlab\n% Value of 'c'\nc = 9;\n% Radius of the circle\nradius = 3;\n% Calculate r^2\nr_squared ="
