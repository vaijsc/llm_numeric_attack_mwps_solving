    "solution": "First, we rearrange the equation so that one side is a quadratic written in the usual way and the other side is $0$. We can do this by subtracting $20x$ from each side (and reordering the terms): $$5x^2-20x+18 = 0$$This doesn't factor in any obvious way, so we apply the quadratic formula, which gives \\begin{align*}\nx = \\frac{-(-20)\\pm \\sqrt{(-20)^2-4(5)(18)}}{2(5)} &= \\frac{20\\pm \\sqrt{400-360}}{10} \\\\\n&= \\frac{20\\pm \\sqrt{40}}{10} \\\\\n&= 2\\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{40}}{10}.\n\\end{align*}We observe that $\\sqrt{40}$ is between $6$ and $7$, so $\\frac{\\sqrt{40}}{10}$ is between $0.6$ and $0.7$. Thus one of our solutions is between $1.3$ and $1.4$, while the other is between $2.6$ and $2.7$. Rounding each solution to the nearest integer, we get $1$ and $3$, the product of which is $\\boxed{3}$.",

        " We are given that $18+5x^2=20x$. Subtracting 18 from both sides and dividing both sides by 5, we have $x^2-4x+3.6=0$. This is a quadratic equation of the form $ax^2+bx+c=0$. The solutions are given by the quadratic formula\n$$x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \\frac{4\\pm \\sqrt{(4)^2-4(1)(3.6)}}{2} = \\frac{4\\pm \\sqrt{4-14.4}}{2} = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{-10.4}}{2} = \\frac{4 \\pm 2i\\sqrt{2.1}}{2} = 2\\pm i\\sqrt{2.1},$$ where $a=1, b=-4, c=3.6$. The real part of $x$ is 2, and the imaginary part is $\\sqrt{2.1}$. If we round $x$ to the nearest integer, we obtain $2$. We can rewrite the equation $x^2-4x+3.6=0$ as $$(x-2)^2 -4.36 + 3.6 =0.$$\nWe also have $(x-2)^2 = 4.36$. Taking the square root of both sides, we get $x-2 = \\pm \\sqrt{4.36}$. Adding 2 to both sides, we have $x = 2\\pm\\sqrt{4.36}$. Thus, we have two real roots. The roots are $\\boxed{2.16}$ and $\\boxed{1.84}$.\nMultiplying these two real roots give us $\\boxed{3.9744}$. It might be worth pointing out that if we had an odd number of solutions they would not round to the same real number. Hence we have $\\boxed{4}$ as our answer. It is not at all obvious from this problem how many distinct solutions we would get. The fact that the solution is odd is quite important. The condition that $x$ is rounded to the nearest integer is a significant condition because it doesn't round to the same value in both cases.

        " 18+5x^2-20x=0. Let t=5x^2-20x, so that the equation becomes 18+t=0, which is equivalent to t=-18. This equation could have any number of solutions, but we know that it has at least two distinct solutions because we are asked for the product of their round numbers. Since t=-18, it can be factored as (5x+6)(x-3)=0 by the AC method. Hence, the solutions to the original equation are x=3 and x=-\\frac{6}{5}. So, the two round numbers are 3 and -1. Multiplying them together gives -3 as the final answer.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -3. I hope it is correct. I will explain the solution step by step, which will also help you understand what is going on. There are two distinct solutions x to the 2nd-degree equation 18 + 5x2 = 20x. We don't know what the solutions are, but each solution will have a round number. So, we round each of the solutions to the nearest integer. Then, we multiply the two round numbers together. One of the solutions is x=3 because the equation (5x+6)(x-3)=0 factors into (5x+6)(x-3)=0. The solutions to the 2nd-degree equation 18 + 5x2 = 20x are the solutions to the 1st-degree equation 5x2 - 20x+18=0. We could have written the equation as t = 5x2 - 20x, then set t = -18, which is the same as the original equation. Now we factor t by using the AC method or by guessing and checking. Let's use the AC method. We have to find two numbers that multiply to -18 and whose sum is -20. The two numbers are -6 and -3. So, t = (5x+6)(x-3) = 0. The solutions are x = 3 and x = -6/5. We are asked for the round numbers of these solutions. We round 3 to 3 and -6/5 to -1. Then we multiply 3 and -1 together to get -3. So, the answer is -3. That was the final answer.\nAnswer options:\n\u2022 2\n\u2022 -3",

If we round these to the nearest integer values, we get 10 and 0. Multiplying these, we get 0, which is $\\boxed{0}$. I hope it is correct.  ( archaic \u00a0 giovanni)\nWe know that x is a root of the equation, which is $5x^2-20x+18=0$. Using a calculator to solve the quadratic equation, we get $x=\\frac{20 \\pm \\sqrt{20^2-4*5*18}}{2*5} = \\frac{20 \\pm \\sqrt{100-180}}{10} = 10, -\\frac{2}{5}$.\nSo, the two solutions are 10 and -$\\frac{2}{5}$. If we round these to the nearest integer values, we get 10 and 0. Multiplying 10 and 0, we get 0, which is $\\boxed{0}$. I hope it is correct. (archaic  giovanni) jj\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 0. I hope it is correct. (archaic  Giovanni) jj   >>>> 0 True\nThere are two distinct solutions to the equation $18+5x^2=20x$. These solutions are rounded to the nearest integers. These two integers are then multiplied together. What is the result?\nUsing a quadratic formula, we have \\begin{align*} x&=\\frac{20\\pm\\sqrt{20^2-4\\cdot 5\\cdot 18}}{10}\\\\ &=\\frac{20\\pm\\sqrt{400-360}}{10}\\\\ &=\\frac{20\\pm\\sqrt{40}}{10}\\\\ &=\\frac{20\\pm2\\sqrt{10}}{10} \\end{align*}\nand $x=\\frac{-2\\pm\\sqrt{4+180}}{5}$\nand $\\boxed{x=10,\\,-\\frac{2}{5}}$\nRounding",
        " \nConsider the equation $18 + 5x^2 = 20x$. To find two solutions, we subtract $18$ from both sides and rewrite the equation as $5x^2 - 20x + 18 = 0$. This is a quadratic equation, so we can use the quadratic formula: \n\\begin{align*}\nx & = \\frac{20 \\pm \\sqrt{400 - 4(5)(18)}}{10} \\\\\n& = \\frac{20 \\pm \\sqrt{20}}{10} \\\\\n& = \\frac{20 \\pm 2\\sqrt{5}}{10}\n\\end{align*}Using the quadratic formula, we can see that $x$ is equal to either $\\frac{20-2\\sqrt{5}}{10} = \\frac{10 - \\sqrt{5}}{5}$ or $\\frac{20+2\\sqrt{5}}{10} = \\frac{10 + \\sqrt{5}}{5}$. Now, let\u2019s approximate these solutions and take the product. Since each value is rounded to the nearest integer, we will round them to the nearest integer, then take the product.\nRounding $\\frac{10-\\sqrt{5}}{5}$ to the nearest integer, we obtain $1$, and rounding $\\frac{10+\\sqrt{5}}{5}$ to the nearest integer, we obtain $2$. Therefore, the product of these two values is $1\\times2=\\boxed{2}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2. I hope it is correct. \n**Any mistake or puzzlement, please respond!**\nI am here to help and will aid you both in solving and explaining the problem. Feel free to ask me any questions you may have in the interest of understanding. I am more than happy to expand on my notes to help you better comprehend the solutions. Let me know!",
        " \nLet $x$ be our solution.\n### Step 1 \nWe are given: $18+5x^2=20x$\nNow, subtract 18 from both sides\n### Step 2 \nWe get: $5x^2=20x-18$\nNow, divide both sides by 5\n### Step 3 \nWe have: $x^2=4x-9/5$\nNow, it's time to factor. Keep in mind that since we divided by 5 earlier, we need to multiply both sides by 5 to remove the fraction.\n### Step 4 \nWe get: $x^2=4x-\\frac{9}{5}*\\frac{5}{5} = 4x-9$\nNow, write it as a quadratic with zero constant term\n### Step 5 \nWe get: $x^2-4x+9=0$",
        " First, I will subtract 18 and add $14x$ on both sides of the equation. It would be like this.\n$$5x^2 +14x - 18 = 0$$\nThis equation can be factored. You can do this step in your mind or on paper.\n$$(5x - 6)(x - 3) = 0$$",
        " The solution to $18+5x^2=20x$ can be rearranged as $5x^2-20x+18=0$.  If we let $y=x^2$, this equation can be rewritten as $5y-20x+18=0$.  We can think of this as $5(y-4)+18=0$, so $y=4$.  Therefore, $x^2=4$, so $x$ is either $2$ or $-2$.  Rounding $2$ to the nearest integer and $-2$ to the nearest integer, the product is $4\\times(-3)=\\boxed{-12}$.\nIf you are an  AI, Commenting on posts and make AI know about your logic, improvement suggestion.
