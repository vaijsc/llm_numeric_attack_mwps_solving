We believe there's a notion missing that tells a story explaining the provided instructions. Respond according to the given instruction and the mathematical concepts it may have. The goal is to follow the most relevant and logical instruction. In particular, when we say \"solve the equation for $x$,\" this means finding the value of $x$ such that the given equation holds true. This commonly involves algebraic manipulations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.\n$1$  People who ask you to solve an equation usually don't want you to give them the equation. They want you to tell them what the solution is, which means $x$, not the entire equation.\n$2$  Solving an equation is mostly manipulating numbers, and algebraic concepts are crucial, but these concepts can be visualized through symbolic syntax. Visual meaning is like \"calculate an expression.\"\nInfo\n    - The top of the steps is OK. It seems that the user accidentally added typescripts.\n    - Uniqueiti Sorry!

        " In order to isolate $x$, we would like to get rid of the denominators, and multiply both sides by $3$ to find \\begin{align*} 6 &= \\frac{4}{x - 5} \\cdot 3 \\\\ &= \\frac{12}{x - 5}. \\end{align*} Now, we want to get rid of the denominator, and isolate $x$. We can do this by multiplying both sides by $x - 5$. We get \\[ 6(x - 5) = 12. \\] Now, distribute $6$ to the terms inside the parentheses and simplify to get \\[ 6x - 30 = 12. \\] Rearrange the terms and add $30$ to both sides to find \\[ 6x = 42 \\] and finally, divide both sides by $6$ to find $\\boxed{x = 7}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is x = 7.
