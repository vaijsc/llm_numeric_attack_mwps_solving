We can identify the intervals using the definition of $f(x)$. To solve for $f(x) = 10$, we set it equal to 10 and solve for $x$ in each interval separately. Once we have the solutions, we add them to get the sum of all possible values of $x$. The method of splitting the problem into subproblems based on the conditions given for the function is a common strategy. This method is particularly useful when dealing with piecewise-defined functions. In this case, the function is piecewise-defined over two intervals, so we need to solve for $f(x) = 10$ in each interval separately. This method also helps us to avoid complex algebra and focus on solving simpler equations in each interval. It is an effective way to solve problems involving piecewise-defined functions.",
