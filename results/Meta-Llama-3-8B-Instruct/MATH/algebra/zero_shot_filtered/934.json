        " 13\n### Additional instructions:\nRecall that a diameter is a straight line that passes through the center of a circle and whose ends are points on the circle.  In this case, the center of the circle lies directly between $(7,-6)$ and $(-3,-4)$, half the distance from each endpoint.  By symmetry, the center of the circle is equally far from both the $x$- and $y$- coordinate of each endpoint, so we can compute its average.  Let\u2019s find the $x$-coordinate of this center first: \\begin{align*} x_{\\text{center}}&=\\frac{7+(-3)}{2}\\\\&=\\frac{4}{2}=2. \\end{align*}  Next let\u2019s find the $y$-coordinate of the center: \\begin{align*} y_{\\text{center}}&=\\frac{-6+(-4)}{2}\\\\&=\\frac{-10}{2}=-5. \\end{align*} Therefore, the center of the circle is located at $(x_{\\text{center, }}y_{\\text{center}}) = (2, -5)$.  Finally, we\u2019re asked to compute the sum of the coordinates of the center, so\n$$2-5=\\boxed{-3}.$$Final Answer: The final answer is -3. I hope it is correct. "
