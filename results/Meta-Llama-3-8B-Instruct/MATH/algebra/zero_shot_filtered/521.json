Do you get $3x^2+5x-1$ when you substitute $x=7$ in? https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1464037/marks-and-sparkleswant-to-know-why-this-expression-3x2-5x-1-evaluates ",
        " We just need to replace $x$ with 7 in the given expression. What we get is $3(7)^2+5(7)-1$. Simplifying we get $3(49)+5(7)-1$.\nNow we just have to simplify $3(49)+5(7)-1$ to obtain the answer. We have\n$$3(49)+5(7)-1=147+35-1=182-1=\\boxed{181}.$$Therefore, $3x^2+5x-1$ if $x=7$ is $\\boxed{181}$.  So, the Correct answer is A. 181.  And the correct answer B is incorrect.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 181. I hope it is correct.  If we go wrong, move on to the next one. Let's continue with the next question. Thank you.
