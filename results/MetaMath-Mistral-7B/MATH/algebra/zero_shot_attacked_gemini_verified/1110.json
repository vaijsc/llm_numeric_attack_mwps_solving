        "To solve (3&9)&8, we first need to understand the operator \"&\". Typically, the \"&\" operator refers to the bitwise AND operation in programming.\n1.

        "First, let's simplify the expression (3&9).\nThe ampersand (&) indicates a logic operation called AND.\nIn logic, AND is a conjunction that applies to propositions.\nIn this case, the proposition is (3&9), which means \"3 and 9\".\nTo solve this, we can use the fact that in binary, 3 is 011 and 9 is 1001.\nUsing the rules of binary addition, we have:\n011 & 1001 = 0011\nSo, (3&9) is equal to 7.\nNow, let's substitute this value back into the original expression:\n(3&9)&8 = 7&8\nAgain, using the rules of binary addition, we have:\n0111 & 1000 = 0000\nSo, (3&9)&8 is equal to 0.\nThe value is: 0",
