        " suggests that $h(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $5$ and $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $b$.\nWe can find the degree of $h(x)$ by multiplying the leading terms of $x^5-7x+10$ and $g(x)$ together. Since $x^5$ is the leading term of $x^5-7x+10$, the degree of $h(x)$ is $5$.\nTherefore, the degree of $g(x)$ is $5-b$ because $h(x) = (x^5-7x+10) \\cdot g(x)$. This means that $5-b$ is equal to $b$, so $2b = 5$ and $b = \\boxed{5/2}$.The answer is: \\frac{5}{2}",

        "If $h(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 5, then the term with the highest degree in $h(x)$ is $x^5$.\nSince $h(x) = (x^5-7x+10) \\cdot g(x)$, there must be a term $x^5$ in $g(x)$ for the product to have a term $x^5$ in $h(x)$.\nTherefore, the degree of $g(x)$ must be 5, so $b = \\boxed{5}$.\nThe answer is: 5",

        "s of the polynomial $h(x)$ must be the same as the roots of the polynomial $(x^5 - 7x + 10) \\cdot g(x)$. \nSince $h(x)$ has degree 5, it must have 5 distinct roots. Therefore, the polynomial $(x^5 - 7x + 10)$ must have 5 distinct roots, which means $g(x) = \\frac{1}{(x^5 - 7x + 10)}$. \nTo find the degree of $g(x)$, we need to determine the degree of the denominator. The degree of the denominator is equal to the degree of the polynomial divided by the greatest common divisor of the coefficients of the polynomial. In this case, the degree of the denominator is 5/1 = 5. \nTherefore, the degree of $g(x)$ is 5, and $b = \\boxed{5}$.The answer is: 5",
