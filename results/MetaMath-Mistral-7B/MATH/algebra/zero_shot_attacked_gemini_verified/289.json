        "To solve this problem step by step, let's start by organizing the information given.\n1. **Teacher to Student Ratio**: The ratio of teachers to students is 1 to 11. This means for every 1 teacher, there are 11 students. Therefore, if we denote the number of teachers as \\( T \\) and the number of students as \\( S \\), we have:\n   \\[\n   T = \\frac{S}{11}\n   \\]\n2. **Female Students and Total Students Ratio**: The ratio of female students to total students is 6 to 9. This means out of every 15 students (since 6 + 9 = 15), 6 are female. Thus, if \\( F \\) represents the number of female students, we can express \\( F \\) in terms of \\( S \\):\n   \\[\n   F = \\frac{6}{15} \\cdot S = \\frac{2}{5} \\cdot S\n   \\]\n   Given that the number of female students \\( F \\) is 396, we can set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2}{5} \\cdot S = 396\n   \\]\n3. **Solving for Total Students \\( S \\)**:\n   To find \\( S \\), we can multiply both sides by \\( \\frac{5}{2} \\):\n   \\[\n   S = 396 \\cdot \\frac{5}{2} = 396 \\cdot 2.5 = 990\n   \\]\n4. **Finding the Number of Teachers \\( T \\)**:\n   Now that we know \\( S = 990 \\), we can find the number of teachers:\n   \\[\n   T = \\frac{S}{11} = \\frac{990}{11} = 90\n   \\]\n5. **Final Result**: The number of teachers in the school is \\( T = 90 \\).\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\text{90}\n\\]",
        "To solve the problem, we can break it down into steps.\n1. **Calculate the total number of students**:\n   Given that the ratio of female students to the total number of students is \\(6:9\\), this means that for every 6 female students, there are 3 male students. We can express this as:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of female students} = \\frac{6}{9} \\times \\text{Total number of students}\n   \\]\n   The total number of female students is given as 396, so we can set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   396 = \\frac{6}{9} \\times \\text{Total number of students}\n   \\]\n   To find the total number of students, we can rearrange the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of students} = 396 \\times \\frac{9}{6}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying that gives:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of students} = 396 \\times 1.5 = 594\n   \\]\n2. **Determine the number of teachers**:\n   Now, we know that the ratio of teachers to students is \\(1:11\\). This implies that for every 1 teacher, there are 11 students:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of teachers} = \\frac{1}{11} \\times \\text{Total number of students}\n   \\]\n   Plugging in the total number of students we calculated:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of teachers} = \\frac{1}{11} \\times 594\n   \\]\n   Calculating that gives:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of teachers} = \\frac{594}{11} = 54\n   \\]\nTherefore, the final result is:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of teachers} = 54\n\\]",
        "Let's solve the problem step by step.\n1. **Understanding the ratios:**\n   - The ratio of teachers to students is 1 to 11. This means for every teacher, there are 11 students.\n   - The ratio of female students to the total number of students is 6 to 9. This can be simplified to 2 to 3 (since 6 and 9 have a common factor of 3).\n2. **Finding total number of students:**\n   - Let \\( S \\) be the total number of students.\n   - According to the ratio of female students to total students (2 to 3), if we let the number of female students be \\( 2x \\), then the total number of students can be expressed as \\( 3x \\).\n   - We know that there are 396 female students. Therefore, \\( 2x = 396 \\).\n3. **Solving for \\( x \\):**\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{396}{2} = 198\n   \\]\n   Now, substituting \\( x \\) back into the equation for total students:\n   \\[\n   S = 3x = 3 \\times 198 = 594\n   \\]\n4. **Finding the number of teachers:**\n   - Since the ratio of teachers to students is 1 to 11, we let the number of teachers be \\( T \\). Thus:\n   \\[\n   T = \\frac{S}{11} = \\frac{594}{11}\n   \\]\n5. **Calculating \\( T \\):**\n   \\[\n   T = \\frac{594}{11} = 54\n   \\]\nThus, the number of teachers is \\( 54 \\).\nFinal result: 54"
