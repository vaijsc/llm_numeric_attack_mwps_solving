        "Mr. Wrench charges $N$ dollars for coming out to the house plus $x$ dollars per hour that he works at the house.\nFor a one-hour repair job, Mr. Wrench charges $N + x = 97$ dollars.\nFor a three-hour repair job, Mr. Wrench charges $3(N + x) = 265$ dollars.\nWe can set up a system of equations to solve for $N$ and $x$.\nFrom the first equation, we have $N + x = 97$.\nFrom the second equation, we have $3N + 3x = 265$.\nMultiplying the first equation by 3, we get $3N + 3x = 291$.\nSubtracting this equation from the second equation, we get $265 - 291 = 0$.\nSolving this equation, we find $x = 10$.\nSubstituting this value back into the first equation, we find $N + 10 = 97$, so $N = 87$.\nTherefore, Mr. Wrench charges $87$ dollars for coming out to the house.\nFor a two-hour repair job, Mr. Wrench would charge $2(N + x) = 2(87 + 10) = \\boxed{204}$ dollars.\nThe answer is: 204",
        "Let's consider the cost of a one-hour repair job. We know that Mr. Wrench charges $x$ dollars per hour, and the job took one hour. So the cost of the one-hour repair job is $x$ dollars.\nWe are given that the cost of a one-hour repair job is $97$ dollars. So we can set up the equation $x = 97$.\nSimilarly, let's consider the cost of a three-hour repair job. We know that Mr. Wrench charges $x$ dollars per hour, and the job took three hours. So the cost of the three-hour repair job is $3x$ dollars.\nWe are given that the cost of a three-hour repair job is $265$ dollars. So we can set up the equation $3x = 265$.\nTo find the charge for a two-hour repair job, we can use the concept of proportionality. We know that the cost of a one-hour repair job is $97$ dollars and the cost of a three-hour repair job is $265$ dollars. Since the ratio of the hours is $1:3$, the ratio of the costs is also $1:3$.\nLet $y$ be the charge for a two-hour repair job. We can set up the proportion: $\\frac{y}{2} = \\frac{265}{3}$.\nTo solve for $y$, we can cross multiply: $3y = 530$. Then divide both sides by $3$: $y = \\frac{530}{3}$.\nTherefore, the charge for a two-hour repair job is $\\boxed{177$ dollars.The answer is: 177",

We can do this by subtracting the cost of labor from the total cost of the three-hour repair job:\n$265 - 3x = N$\nSince both expressions represent the same value, we can set them equal to each other and solve for $x$:\n$97 - x = 265 - 3x$\n$97 + 2x = 265$\n$2x = 168$\n$x = 84$\nNow, we can find the charge for a two-hour repair job by multiplying the cost of labor per hour by the number of hours:\n$2 \\times 84 = \\boxed{168}$.The answer is: 168",
