        "Let the two numbers be $x$ and $y$.\nWe are given that $x+y=32$ and $xy=35$.\nTo find the positive difference between the numbers, we need to find $|x-y|$.\nWe can solve this problem by factoring $xy=35$ and recognizing that the factors must be the numbers themselves.\nThe factors of 35 are 1, 5, 7, and 35.\nSince $x$ and $y$ are both positive (given that we are looking for the positive difference between the numbers),\nwe can discard the factors that are 1, 5, and 7.\nThe remaining factor is 35, so $x=35$ and $y=1$.\nThe positive difference between the numbers is $|35-1|=\\boxed{34}$.\nThe answer is: 34",
        "Let the two numbers be $x$ and $y$, with $x > y$.\nWe are given that $x + y = 32$ and $xy = 35$.\nWe want to find the positive difference between the numbers, which is $x - y$.\nWe can rewrite this as $x - y = x + (-y)$.\nUsing the distributive property, we have $x - y = (x + (-1)y)$.\nWe can now use the given information to substitute values.\nSubstituting $x + y = 32$ and $xy = 35$, we have $x - y = (32 + (-1)y)$.\nSimplifying, we get $x - y = 32 - y$.\nNow, we can solve for $x$ in terms of $y$ by subtracting $32$ from both sides of the equation.\nWe have $-y = 32 - x$, which can be rearranged to $x = 32 - y$.\nFinally, substituting $x = 32 - y$ into the equation $x - y = 32 - y - y$, we get $x - y = 32 - 2y$.\nSince $x > y$, we only need to consider the positive difference, which is $32 - 2y$.\nWe are given that the product of the numbers is $35$, so $xy = 35$.\nSubstituting $x = 32 - y$, we have $(32 - y)y = 35$.\nExpanding and rearranging, we get $y^2 - 32y + 35 = 0$.\nThis quadratic factors as $(y - 7)(y - 5) = 0$.\nTherefore, $y = 7$ or $y = 5$.\nSince $x > y$, we take $x = 32 - y$ to be positive.\nTherefore, $x = 32 - 7 = 25$ when $y = 7$ and $x = 32 - 5 = 27$ when $y = 5$.\nFinally, the positive difference between the numbers is $x - y = \\boxed{25 - 7 = 1"
