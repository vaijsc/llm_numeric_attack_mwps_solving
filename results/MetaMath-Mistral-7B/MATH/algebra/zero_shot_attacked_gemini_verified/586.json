        " of an arithmetic sequence, and let be the common difference.\nWe are given that the product of the first and the third terms is 7, so we have the equation:\n( + 2d)( + 4d) = 7\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n + 8d^2 + 4d = 7\nSubtracting 7 from both sides, we have:\n + 8d^2 + 4d - 7 = 0\nThis quadratic equation does not factor nicely, so we can use the quadratic formula:\nd = (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac))/(2a)\nSubstituting the values a = 8, b = 4, and c = -7, we have:\nd = (-4 \u00b1 sqrt(4^2 - 4(8)(-7)))/(2(8))\nd = (-4 \u00b1 sqrt(16 + 224))/(16)\nd = (-4 \u00b1 sqrt(240))/(16)\nd = (-4 \u00b1 2sqrt(60))/(16)\nd = (-4 \u00b1 4sqrt(15))/(16)\nSince the terms of the arithmetic sequence are positive integers, we take the positive value:\nd = -4 + 4sqrt(15)/16\nNow we can find the fourth term by using the formula for the general term of an arithmetic sequence:\n = + 3d\n = + 3(-4 + 4sqrt(15)/16)\n = 4sqrt(15)/16 + 12/16 - 16/16\n = 4sqrt(15)/16 - 4/16\n = (4sqrt(15) - 4)/16\n = (4sqrt(15) - 4)/16\nSo, the fourth term is 4sqrt(15) - 4.The answer is: 4",

However, since we are given that the terms are positive, we can eliminate the negative values.\nTherefore, the possible values for $a$ and $c$ are (1, 7) and (7, 1).\nNow, we need to find the fourth term, which is the next term in the arithmetic sequence. Since the common difference between terms is the same, we can find the fourth term by adding either $b$ or $c$ to the third term.\nIf we add $b$ to $c$, we get $b + c = 7 + 1 = 8$. However, if we add $c$ to $b$, we get $b + c = 1 + 7 = 8$. Therefore, it does not matter which term we add, the result will be the same.\nTherefore, the fourth term is $\\boxed{8}$.The answer is: 8",
