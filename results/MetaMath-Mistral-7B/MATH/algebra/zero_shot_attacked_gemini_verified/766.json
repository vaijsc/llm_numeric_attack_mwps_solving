        "If the team won $2/9$ of its games, then it lost $1 - 2/9 = 7/9$ of its games.\nSince we lost 45 more games than we won, we lost $2/9 + 45$ games.\nWe can set up the equation $(7/9)(x) = (2/9)(x) + 45$, where $x$ is the total number of games played.\nSimplifying this equation, we get $(7/9)(x) = (2/9)(x) + 45$.\nMultiplying both sides by $9/7$, we get $x = (2/7)(x) + 45(9/7)$.\nSimplifying, we have $x = 2x/7 + 45(3/7)$.\nMultiplying both sides by $7$, we get $7x = 2x + 45(3)$.\nSubtracting $2x$ from both sides, we have $5x = 45(3)$.\nDividing both sides by $5$, we get $x = 45(3)/5$.\nSimplifying, we have $x = \\boxed{27}$.\nThe answer is: 27",
        "We know that the team won $2/9$ of its games.\nThis means that the team lost $1-2/9=7/9$ of its games.\nIf we lost 45 more games than we won, this means that the number of games we won is $7/9-45$.\nTo find the total number of games played, we can set up the equation $x=\\text{won games}+45+\\text{lost games}$, where $x$ is the total number of games played.\nSubstituting in the values we know, we get $x=(7/9-45)+\\text{lost games}$.\nTo find the total number of games played, we need to find the value of $x$.\nSimplifying the expression, we get $x=(7/9-45)+(7/9)=(7-45)/9+7/9=-38/9+7/9=-31/9$.\nTherefore, the team played $\\boxed{31}$ games this year.The answer is: 31",

        "If we won $2/9$ of our games, that means we lost $1 - 2/9 = 7/9$ of our games.\nLet's assume we won $x$ games. Then we lost $x + 45$ games.\nThe total number of games we played is $x + (x + 45) = 2x + 45$.\nWe know that the winner of a game receives 1 point and the loser receives 0 points, so the total number of points we earned is $2x$.\nThe total number of points we lost is $1 \\cdot (x + 45) = x + 45$.\nSince the total number of points we earned is equal to the total number of points we lost, we have $2x = x + 45$.\nSimplifying, we find $x = 45$.\nSo we won 45 games and lost $45 + 45 = 90$ games.\nTherefore, we played a total of $45 + 90 = \\boxed{135}$ games.
