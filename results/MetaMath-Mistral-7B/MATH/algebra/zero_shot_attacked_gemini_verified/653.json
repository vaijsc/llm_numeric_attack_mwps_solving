        "Let's assume David worked x hours.\nAlan worked three times as many hours as David, so Alan worked 3x hours.\nDavid placed 40 bricks per hour, so he placed a total of 40x bricks.\nAlan placed 40 bricks per hour, so he placed a total of 40(3x) = 120x bricks.\nThe two of them placed a total of 40x + 120x = 160x bricks.\nWe know the total number of bricks placed is 600, so 160x = 600.\nTo solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 160: x = 600/160 = 3.75.\nSince we can't have a fraction of an hour, we round down to the nearest whole number.\nTherefore, David worked 3 hours, and David laid a total of 40(3) = 120 bricks.\n#### 120\nThe answer is: 120",
        "Alan and David together placed 600 bricks, so if Alan placed 40 bricks per hour, then David placed 600 - (3 * 40) = 600 - 120 = 480 bricks.\nSince David placed 480 bricks, and the ratio of their hours worked is 3:1, then David worked 1 hour for every 3 hours Alan worked.\nTherefore, David placed 480/40 = 12 bricks per hour.\nSo David laid 480/12 = 40 bricks.\nThe answer is: 40",

Dividing both sides of the equation by 4, we get x = 600/4 = 150.\nTherefore, David worked 150 hours.\nSince David placed 40 bricks per hour, the total number of bricks he laid is 150 * 40 = 6000 bricks.\nSo, David laid 6000 bricks.\n#### 6000\nThe answer is: 6000",
