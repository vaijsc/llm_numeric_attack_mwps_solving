        "Let's denote Andrew's current age as \\( A \\) and his grandfather's current age as \\( G \\).\nAccording to the problem:\n1. \\( G = 8A \\) (Andrew's grandfather's age is eight times Andrew's age).\n2. When Andrew was born, his grandfather was 86 years old.\nIf Andrew is currently \\( A \\) years old, then he was born \\( A \\) years ago. Therefore, his grandfather's current age can also be expressed as:\n\\[\nG = 86 + A\n\\]\nNow we have two equations:\n1. \\( G = 8A \\)\n2. \\( G = 86 + A \\)\nWe can set these two expressions for \\( G \\) equal to each other:\n\\[\n8A = 86 + A\n\\]\nNow, we will solve for \\( A \\):\n1. Subtract \\( A \\) from both sides:\n\\[\n8A - A = 86\n\\]\n\\[\n7A = 86\n\\]\n2. Now, divide both sides by 7:\n\\[\nA = \\frac{86}{7}\n\\]\nCalculating this, we get:\n\\[\nA = 12.28571428571429\n\\]\nSince the instruction states to convert to float:\n\\[\nA \\approx 12.29\n\\]\nNow, substituting back to find grandfather's age:\n\\[\nG = 8A = 8 \\times 12.28571428571429 \\approx 98.28571428571429\n\\]\nHowever, age must be an integer, and since we've derived \\( A \\) as a fraction, it suggests that there's no valid solution in integers while keeping grandfather's age as exactly 8 times Andrew's age.\nTherefore, we conclude:\nnot exist\nFinal answer: not exist",
        "Let \\( A \\) be Andrew's current age, and \\( G \\) be Andrew's grandfather's current age.\nFrom the problem, we have the following two pieces of information:\n1. Andrew's grandfather's age is eight times Andrew's age:\n   \\[\n   G = 8A\n   \\]\n   \n2. Andrew's grandfather was 86 years old when Andrew was born. This means that the age difference between Andrew's grandfather and Andrew is 86 years:\n   \\[\n   G = A + 86\n   \\]\nNow, we can set the two equations we have for \\( G \\) equal to each other:\n\\[\n8A = A + 86\n\\]\nNext, we'll solve for \\( A \\):\nSubtract \\( A \\) from both sides:\n\\[\n8A - A = 86\n\\]\n\\[\n7A = 86\n\\]\nNow, divide both sides by 7:\n\\[\nA = \\frac{86}{7}\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\nA = 12.285714285714286\n\\]\nTo provide the final result in float:\n\\[\nA \\approx 12.29\n\\]\nNow to find Andrew's grandfather's age using \\( G = 8A \\):\n\\[\nG = 8 \\times \\frac{86}{7} = \\frac{688}{7} \\approx 98.28571428571429\n\\]\nBoth ages can be verified to make sure they are consistent:\n- If Andrew is approximately 12.29 years old, then his grandfather is pegged at 8 times that, which approximates to 98.29.\n- The age difference should be consistent with the condition that grandfather was 86 when Andrew was born:\n   - \\( G - A = 86 \\)\n   - \\( \\frac{688}{7} - \\frac{86}{7} = \\frac{688 - 86}{7} = \\frac{602}{7} = 86 \\) \nSince everything checks out, the final answer for Andrew's age is approximately:\n**Final result: 12.285714285714286**",
        "Let Andrew's current age be \\( a \\).\nThen, Andrew's grandfather's current age is \\( 8a \\) (since his grandfather's age is eight times Andrew's age).\nAccording to the problem, when Andrew was born (which is \\( a \\) years ago), his grandfather was \\( 86 \\) years old. This means the difference in their ages is \\( 86 \\) years.\nNow, we can set up the equation based on their ages:\n\\[\n8a - a = 86\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n7a = 86\n\\]\nTo find Andrew's age, we divide both sides by \\( 7 \\):\n\\[\na = \\frac{86}{7}\n\\]\nCalculating this gives:\n\\[\na = 12.285714285714286\n\\]\nThus, Andrew's current age is approximately \\( 12.29 \\) (as a float). \nFinal result: 12.285714285714286"
