        "We start by expanding the left side of the equation:\n\\[x^2 - 5x = 1.\\]\nNext, we move all the terms to one side to get the quadratic equation:\n\\[x^2 - 5x - 1 = 0.\\]\nNow we can attempt to factor the quadratic. Since the coefficient of $x^2$ is 1, we look for two numbers that multiply to give -1 and add to give -5. These numbers are -1 and 1, so we can rewrite the equation as:\n\\[(x - 1)(x + 1) = 0.\\]\nSetting each factor equal to 0, we find two possible solutions:\n\\[x - 1 = 0 \\implies x = 1,\\]\n\\[x + 1 = 0 \\implies x = -1.\\]\nSo the two solutions are $x = 1$ and $x = -1$. However, the problem states that the solutions may be expressed in the form $\\frac{a+\\sqrt{b}}{c}$ and $\\frac{a-\\sqrt{b}}{c}$. To find the solutions in this form, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\\[x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}.\\]\nIn this case, $a = 1$, $b = -5$, and $c = 1$. Plugging these values into the quadratic formula, we have:\n\\[x = \\frac{-(-5) \\pm \\sqrt{(-5)^2 - 4(1)(1)}}{2(1)}.\\]\nSimplifying, we get:\n\\[x = \\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{25 - 4}}{2}.\\]\nFinally, we simplify the square root term:\n\\[x = \\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{21}}{2}.\\]\nSo the solutions are $\\frac{5 + \\sqrt{21}}{2}$ and $\\frac{5 - \\sqrt{21}}{2}$.\nNow, let\u2019s find the value of $abc$.
