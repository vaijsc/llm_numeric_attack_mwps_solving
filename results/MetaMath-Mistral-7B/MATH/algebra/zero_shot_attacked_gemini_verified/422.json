        "Let the length of the garden be $l$ and the width be $w$.\nThe perimeter of the garden is $2l + 2w$, and we are given that it is equal to 300 feet.\nSo, $2l + 2w = 300$.\nWe want to maximize the area of the garden, which is given by $lw$.\nTo do this, we can use the AM-GM inequality, which states that the arithmetic mean of a set of non-negative numbers is greater than or equal to the geometric mean of the same set of numbers.\nIn this case, the arithmetic mean of $l$ and $w$ is $\\frac{l + w}{2}$, and the geometric mean is $\\sqrt{lw}$.\nSo, we have $\\frac{l + w}{2} \\geq \\sqrt{lw}$.\nMultiplying both sides by 2, we get $l + w \\geq 2\\sqrt{lw}$.\nNow, let's substitute $2l + 2w = 300$ into the inequality.\nWe have $300 \\geq 2\\sqrt{lw}$.\nDividing both sides by 2 and squaring both sides, we get $900 \\geq 4lw$.\nDividing both sides by 4, we get $225 \\geq lw$.\nTherefore, the maximum area of the garden is $\\boxed{225}$ square feet.\nThe answer is: 225",
