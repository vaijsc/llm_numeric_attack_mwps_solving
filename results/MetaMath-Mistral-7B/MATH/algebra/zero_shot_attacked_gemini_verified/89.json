Starting with the expression:\n   \\[\n   x^2 - 8x + 13\n   \\]\n2. We want to complete the square for the quadratic part \\( x^2 - 8x \\). To do this, we take half of the coefficient of \\( x \\) (which is -8), square it, and add and subtract that square:\n   \\[\n   x^2 - 8x = (x - 4)^2 - 16\n   \\]\n3.
