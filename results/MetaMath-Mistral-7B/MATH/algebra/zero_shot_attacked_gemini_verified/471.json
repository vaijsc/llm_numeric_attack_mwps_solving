        "From the given information, we can set up the following equations:\n6 cookies = 2 brownies\n4 brownies = 10 cupcakes\nTo find out how many cupcakes Bob can buy for the price of fifty-eight cookies, we need to find the ratio of cupcakes to cookies.\nFrom the first equation, we can write:\n6 cookies / 2 brownies = 1 cookie / (2/6) brownie\nSimplifying, we get:\n6 cookies / 2 brownies = 6 cookies / (1/3) brownie = 6 * (3/1) = 18 cupcakes\nFrom the second equation, we can write:\n4 brownies / 10 cupcakes = 1 brownie / (10/4) cupcakes = 1 brownie / (2.5) cupcakes = 1 brownie / 2.5 cupcakes\nNow, we can multiply the two ratios:\n18 cupcakes * (1 brownie / 2.5 cupcakes) = (18 * 1) / (2.5) = 18/2.5 = 7.2 cupcakes\nTherefore, Bob can buy approximately 7 cupcakes for the price of fifty-eight cookies.The answer is: 7",
