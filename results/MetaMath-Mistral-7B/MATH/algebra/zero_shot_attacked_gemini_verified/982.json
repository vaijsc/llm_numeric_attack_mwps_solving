        "We can factor the expression as a perfect square trinomial: $a^2+8a-7=(a+4)^2-21$.\nSince $(a+4)^2$ is always nonnegative, the minimum value of the expression occurs when $(a+4)^2=0$, which is when $a=-4$.\nEvaluating the expression at $a=-4$, we find that the minimum value is $(-4+4)^2-21=0-21=\\boxed{-21}$.\nThe answer is: -21",
        "To find the minimum value of a quadratic function, we can rewrite the quadratic in vertex form.\nThe vertex form of a quadratic is $y=a(x-h)^2+k$, where $(h,k)$ is the vertex of the parabola.\nIn this case, the quadratic is $a^2+8a-7$.\nCompleting the square, we have $(a+4)^2-7-4=a^2+8a-7$.\nTherefore, the minimum value of $a^2+8a-7$ is $(-4)^2-7-4=\\boxed{-11}$.\nThe answer is: -11",
        "The given expression is a quadratic function of $a$, which represents a parabola when graphed.\nTo find the minimum value of the quadratic function, we need to find the vertex of the parabola.\nThe vertex of a parabola in the form $y=a(x-h)^2+k$ is given by the point $(h,k)$.\nIn this case, the quadratic function is $a^2+8a-7$, so the vertex is $(h,k)=(-2,1)$.\nTherefore, the minimum value of the quadratic function is $1$.\nThe answer is: 1",
        "We can rewrite the quadratic as $a^2+8a-7$.\nTo find the minimum value, we need to find the vertex of the parabola defined by this quadratic.\nThe x-coordinate of the vertex can be found using the formula $x=-\\frac{b}{2a}$, where $a$ is the coefficient of $a^2$ and $b$ is the coefficient of $a$.\nIn this case, $a=1$ and $b=8$, so $x=-\\frac{8}{2(1)}=-4$.\nTo find the y-coordinate of the vertex, we can substitute $x=-4$ into the quadratic formula.\n$a^2+8a-7=(-4)^2+8(-4)-7=16-32-7=-19$.\nTherefore, the minimum value of $a^2+8a-7$ is $\\boxed{-19}$.\nThe answer is: -19",
