        "To solve the equation \\( 5^{2x} = 256^\\frac{1}{2} \\), let's start with the right side of the equation:\n1. We need to simplify \\( 256^\\frac{1}{2} \\).

Next, we can express \\( 16 \\) as a power of \\( 5 \\). Notice that \\( 16 = 2^4 \\), so we still have \\( 5^{2x} = 16 \\).\n3. We can take the logarithm of both sides to help solve for \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   \\log(5^{2x}) = \\log(16).\n   \\]\n4. Using the power property of logarithms, this becomes:\n   \\[\n   2x \\log(5) = \\log(16).\n   \\]\n5.

Substituting this in:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{4 \\log(2)}{2 \\log(5)} = \\frac{2 \\log(2)}{\\log(5)}.\n   \\]\n8.

Now we can rewrite the equation as:\n   \\[\n   5^{2x} = 2^4\n   \\]\n5. Taking the logarithm of both sides gives us:\n   \\[\n   \\log(5^{2x}) = \\log(2^4)\n   \\]\n6. Using the properties of logarithms:\n   \\[\n   2x \\log(5) = 4 \\log(2)\n   \\]\n7.
