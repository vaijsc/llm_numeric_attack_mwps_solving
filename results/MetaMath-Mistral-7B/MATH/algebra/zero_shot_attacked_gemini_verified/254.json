        "Angie's class has 24 students and 21 of them are wearing red.\nSo, the ratio of students wearing red to the total number of students in her class is 21/24.\nIf we multiply this ratio by the total number of students in her school, we can estimate how many students are wearing red.\nThe total number of students in her school is 480.\nSo, the estimated number of students wearing red is (21/24) * 480 = 360.\nTherefore, Angie estimates that 360 students out of the 480 students in her school will be wearing red on Valentine's Day.\nThe answer is: 360",
        "Angie's class has 21 students wearing red out of 24 students total.\nSo the ratio of students wearing red to total students in Angie's class is 21/24.\nTo estimate the number of students wearing red in the entire school, we can use the same ratio.\nThere are 480 students in the school, so we multiply the ratio by 480 to get the estimated number of students wearing red:\n(21/24) * 480 = 360.\nTherefore, Angie estimates that 360 students in the school will be wearing red on Valentine's Day.\nThe answer is: 360",
        "The ratio of students wearing red in Angie's class to the total number of students in her class is 21/24 = 7/8.\nIf we want to estimate the number of students wearing red in her school, we can set up a proportion:\n(7/8) = x/480\nCross multiplying, we get:\n8x = 7 * 480\n8x = 3360\nDividing both sides by 8, we get:\nx = 420\nTherefore, Angie will estimate that 420 of the 480 students in her school are wearing red. The answer is: 420",
        "If Angie's class has 24 students and 21 of them are wearing red, then the ratio of students wearing red to the total number of students is 21/24.\nNow, let's apply this ratio to the total number of students in the school, which is 480.\nThe number of students wearing red will be (21/24) * 480 = 350.\nTherefore, Angie will estimate that 350 of the 480 students in her school are wearing red.\nThe answer is: 350",
