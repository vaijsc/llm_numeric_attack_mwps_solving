        "\nLet $n$ be the greater of the two squares. Then the other square will be $n-91$.\nAccording to the given information, we have the equation $(n-91) - (n-1) = 91$.\nSimplifying the equation, we get $n-91-n+1=91$, or $-90=91$, which is not true.\nTherefore, there is no valid value for $n$ that satisfies the given conditions.\nHence, there is no answer to the question.The answer is: 91",
