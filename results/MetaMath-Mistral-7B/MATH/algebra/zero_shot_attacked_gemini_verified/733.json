        "To maximize the revenue when selling books, we start with the function that represents the revenue \\( R \\). The revenue can be calculated by multiplying the number of books sold by the price per book. \nGiven that the number of books sold is given by the equation:\n\\[\nq = 120 - 4p\n\\]\nwhere \\( p \\) is the price in dollars, we can express revenue \\( R \\) as:\n\\[\nR = p \\cdot q = p \\cdot (120 - 4p)\n\\]\nExpanding this expression, we have:\n\\[\nR = 120p - 4p^2\n\\]\nThis is a quadratic function in terms of \\( p \\), and it can be represented in the standard form:\n\\[\nR = -4p^2 + 120p\n\\]\nNext, we need to find the maximum point of this quadratic function.
