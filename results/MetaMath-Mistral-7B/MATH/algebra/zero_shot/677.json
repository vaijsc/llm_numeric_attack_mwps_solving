        "To find the value of \\( xy \\) given the equations \\( (x + y)^2 = 105 \\) and \\( x^2 + y^2 = 65 \\), we can start by expanding the first equation.\n1. The equation \\( (x + y)^2 = 105 \\) can be expanded as:\n   \\[\n   (x + y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\( x^2 + y^2 = 65 \\) into this equation gives us:\n   \\[\n   105 = 65 + 2xy\n   \\]\n2.

        "To solve for \\( xy \\) given the equations \\((x + y)^2 = 105\\) and \\(x^2 + y^2 = 65\\), we can use some algebraic identities and manipulate the equations step by step.\n1.
