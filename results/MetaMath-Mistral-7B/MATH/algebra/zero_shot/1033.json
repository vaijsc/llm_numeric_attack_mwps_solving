        "We can rewrite the quadratic as $(x+1)^2 - 7.6$.\nSo $b=1$ and $c=-7.6$.\nTherefore, $b+c=1+(-7.6)=\\boxed{-6.6}$.\nThe answer is: -6.6",
        "\nWe have the quadratic $x^2 + 2.6x + 3.6$.\nTo write this in the form $(x + b)^2 + c$, we need to complete the square.\nWe have $2.6x$, which is half of $(2.6)(2) = 5.2$.\nSo, we add and subtract $5.2$ inside the parentheses:\n$$x^2 + 2.6x + 3.6 = (x^2 + 2.6x + 5.2) - 5.2 + 3.6.$$\nWe can rewrite this as $(x^2 + 2.6x + 5.2) - 1.6$.\nTo complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of $x$ and square it:\n$$(x^2 + 2.6x + 5.2) - 1.6 = ((x + 1.3)^2 - 1.6) + 5.2.$$\nSo, we have $(x + 1.3)^2 + (5.2 - 1.6) = (x + 1.3)^2 + 3.6$.\nTherefore, $b + c = 1.3 + 3.6 = \\boxed{4.9}$.The answer is: 4.9",
        "To rewrite the quadratic $x^2+(2.6)x+3.6$ in the form $(x+b)^2+c$, we want to complete the square.\nWe can do this by adding and subtracting $(2.6/2)^2=1.36$ inside the parentheses:\n$x^2+(2.6)x+3.6=(x^2+(2.6)x+1.36)+(3.6-1.36)=(x+1.3)^2+2.24$.\nSo, $b=1.3$ and $c=2.24$, and $b+c=1.3+2.24=\\boxed{3.54}$.\nThe answer is: 3.54",
        "We complete the square to write the quadratic in the form $(x+b)^2+c$:\n\\begin{align*}\nx^2+(2.6)x+3.6 &= (x^2+2.6x)+3.6 \\\\\n&= (x^2+2.6x+(-2.6)^2)+3.6-(-2.6)^2 \\\\\n&= (x^2+2.6x+3.06)+1.24 \\\\\n&= (x^2+2.6x+3.06)+1.24 \\\\\n&= (x+1.3)^2+1.24.\n\\end{align*}\nTherefore, $b+c = 1.3+1.24 = \\boxed{2.54}$.The answer is: 2.54"
