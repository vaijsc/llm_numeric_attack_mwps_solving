        "To determine the smallest integer value of \\( x \\) for which \\( f(x) = \\frac{\\sqrt{x-1}}{x-2} \\) has a real number value, we need to ensure that both the numerator and the denominator are valid.\n1. **Consider the numerator \\( \\sqrt{x-1} \\)**:\n   - The expression under the square root must be non-negative, so we set up the inequality:\n     \\[\n     x - 1 \\geq 0\n     \\]\n     This simplifies to:\n     \\[\n     x \\geq 1\n     \\]\n   - Thus, \\( x \\) must be at least 1.\n2. **Consider the denominator \\( x - 2 \\)**:\n   - The denominator cannot be zero, so we set up the inequality:\n     \\[\n     x - 2 \\neq 0\n     \\]\n     This simplifies to:\n     \\[\n     x \\neq 2\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, while \\( x \\) should be at least 1, it cannot be equal to 2.\n3. **Combine the conditions**:\n   - From the numerator, we have \\( x \\geq 1 \\).\n   - From the denominator, we have \\( x \\neq 2 \\).\n4. **Determine the smallest integer satisfying these conditions**:\n   - The smallest integer \\( x \\geq 1 \\) is 1.\n   - However, since \\( x = 2 \\) is not allowed, we check the next integers. The next integer after 1 is 2 (not allowed), so we check 3.\n   - The next integer after 2 is 3.\n5. **Test \\( x = 1 \\)**:\n   - Plugging \\( x = 1 \\) into the function gives:\n     \\[\n     f(1) = \\frac{\\sqrt{1-1}}{1-2} = \\frac{0}{-1} = 0\n     \\]\n   - This is defined as it's \\( \\frac{0}{-1} = 0 \\).\n6. **Check \\( x = 2 \\)**:\n   - This value is not valid since it makes the denominator zero.\n7. **Check \\( x = 3 \\)**:\n   - Plugging \\( x = 3 \\) into the function gives:\n     \\[\n     f(3) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3-1}}{3-2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{1} = \\sqrt{2}\n     \\]\n   - This is also defined.\nThus, the smallest integer \\( x \\) such that \\( f(x) \\) has a real number value is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]",

        "To find the smallest possible integer value for $x$ such that $f(x)$ has a real number value, we need to determine the values of $x$ that make the denominator $x-2$ non-zero.\nSince division by zero is undefined, we need to ensure that $x-2$ is not equal to zero.\nThis means $x$ must be greater than 2.\nNext, we need to determine the values of $x$ that make the radical $\\sqrt{x-1}$ real.\nSince the square root of a negative number is not a real number, we need to ensure that $x-1$ is greater than or equal to zero.\nThis means $x$ must be greater than or equal to 1.\nCombining these two conditions, we find that the smallest possible integer value for $x$ is $\\boxed{2}$.\nThe answer is: 2",
        "For $f(x)$ to have a real number value, the expression $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-1}}{x-2}$ must be defined.\nThis means that the denominator $x-2$ cannot be zero, so $x \\neq 2$.\nAdditionally, we need the expression to be defined, which means that $x-1$ must be greater than or equal to zero: $x \\geq 1$.\nFinally, we want $f(x)$ to have a real number value, which means that the expression under the square root must be greater than or equal to zero: $x-1 \\geq 0$, or $x \\geq 1$.\nCombining these conditions, we find that the smallest possible integer value for $x$ is $\\boxed{1}$.\nThe answer is: 1",
        "We first simplify the expression $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-1}}{x-2}$.\nWe need to find the smallest possible integer value for $x$ such that the expression has a real number value.\nFor the expression to have a real number value, the denominator $x-2$ cannot be equal to zero.\nSo, $x$ cannot be equal to 2.\nNext, we simplify the expression when $x > 2$.\nWe have $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-1}}{x-2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{x-1}}{\\sqrt{(x-1)^2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{x-1}}{x-1} = \\sqrt{x-1}$.\nSince $\\sqrt{x-1}$ is always positive for $x > 2$, the expression has a real number value for all $x > 2$.\nFinally, we simplify the expression when $x \\leq 2$.\nWe have $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-1}}{x-2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{x-1}}{x-2} \\cdot \\frac{x-2}{x-2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{(x-1)(x-2)}}{x-2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{(x-2)(x-1)}}{x-2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}\\sqrt{x-1}}{x-2}$.\nSince both $\\sqrt{x-2}$ and $\\sqrt{x-1}$ are non-negative for $x \\leq 2$, we can change the order of the square roots.\nWe have $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}\\sqrt{x-1}}{x-2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{(x-1)(x-2)}}{x-2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{x-2(x-1)}}{x-2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1}}{x-2} = \\frac{1}{x-2}$.\nFor $x \\leq 2$, $\\frac{1}{x-2}$ is not defined since the denominator $x-2$ is equal to zero.\nSo, the smallest possible integer value for $x$ such that $f(x)$ has a real number value is $\\boxed{3}$.The answer is: 3",
        "The expression $\\frac{\\sqrt{x - 1}}{x - 2}$ is defined only if the denominator $x - 2$ is not equal to zero.\nSo, we need to find the smallest possible integer value for $x$ such that $x - 2 \\neq 0$.\nThis means $x \\neq 2$.\nTo find the smallest possible integer value for $x$, we can start with $x = 3$.\nIf $x = 3$, then $\\frac{\\sqrt{x - 1}}{x - 2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3 - 1}}{3 - 2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{1} = \\sqrt{2}$.\nSince $\\sqrt{2}$ is a real number, we have found one possible value for $x$.\nLet's continue checking other values of $x$.\nIf $x = 4$, then $\\frac{\\sqrt{x - 1}}{x - 2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{4 - 1}}{4 - 2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\nSince $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ is a real number, we have found another possible value for $x$.\nIf $x = 5$, then $\\frac{\\sqrt{x - 1}}{x - 2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{5 - 1}}{5 - 2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{4}}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}$.\nSince $\\frac{2}{3}$ is a real number, we have found another possible value for $x$.\nTherefore, the smallest possible integer value for $x$ such that $f(x)$ has a real number value is $\\boxed{3}$.The answer is: 3",
        "For $f(x)$ to have a real number value, the expression $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-1}}{x-2}$ must be defined and have a real value.\nThis means that the denominator $x-2$ must not be equal to zero and the expression under the square root must be greater than or equal to zero.\nFirst, we know that $x-2$ must not equal zero, so $x \\neq 2$.\nNext, we know that the expression under the square root must be greater than or equal to zero, so $x-1 \\geq 0$, which means $x \\geq 1$.\nTherefore, the smallest possible integer value for $x$ such that $f(x)$ has a real number value is $\\boxed{2}$.\nThe answer is: 2"
