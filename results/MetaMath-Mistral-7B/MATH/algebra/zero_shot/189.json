        "The quadratic equation $x^2 + bx + c = 0$ has roots $r$ and $s$, and we are given that $|r - s| = |b - 2c|$.\nSince the difference of the roots is always equal to the absolute value of the difference of the roots, we know that $r - s = b - 2c$ or $r - s = -(b - 2c)$.\nIn the first case, we have $r = b - 2c + s$.\nIn the second case, we have $r = -(b - 2c) + s$.\nIn both cases, we have $r + s = b - 2c$.\nWe also know that the sum of the roots is $-(b/1) = -b$.\nSetting these two equations equal to each other, we have $-b + s + s = b - 2c$, or $2s = b - 2c - b$, or $2s = -2c$.\nTherefore, $s = -c$ and $r + (-c) = b - 2c$.\nSince $c \\neq 0$, we can divide both sides of this equation by $-c$ to get $r = \\frac{b}{c} - 2$.\nThe difference of the roots is then $|r - s| = \\left|\\frac{b}{c} - 2 - (-c)\\right| = \\left|\\frac{b}{c} - c - 2\\right| = |b - 2c|$.\nSince this difference is equal to $|b - 2c|$, we know that $\\frac{b}{c} - c - 2 = b - 2c$.\nRearranging terms, we have $\\frac{b}{c} - b = c + 4$.\nFactoring the left side, we have $\\frac{b - c^2}{c} = c + 4$.\nMultiplying both sides by $c$, we have $b - c^2 = c^2 + 4c$.\nAdding $c^2$ to both sides, we have $b = c^2 + 4c$.\nThus, $c$ in terms of $b$ is $\\boxed{2}$.The answer is: 2",
        "We know that the difference of the roots of a quadratic equation can be found using the formula $d = |b - 2c|$, where $b$ and $c$ are the coefficients of the quadratic equation.\nIn this case, the quadratic equation is $x^2 + bx + c = 0$, so we can use the quadratic formula to find the roots: \\[\nx = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4c}}{2}.\n\\]The difference of the roots is then \\[\nd = |b - 2c| = \\left|\\frac{-b + \\sqrt{b^2 - 4c}}{2} - \\frac{-b - \\sqrt{b^2 - 4c}}{2}\\right| = \\left|\\frac{2b}{2}\\right| = |b|.\n\\]We are given that $d = |b - 2c|$, so we can conclude that $|b| = |b - 2c|$.\nThis means that $b$ must be equal to $b - 2c$ or $-(b - 2c)$.\nCase 1: $b = b - 2c$\nSolving for $c$, we get $c = 0$.\nBut we are given that $c \\neq 0$, so this case is not possible.\nCase 2: $b = -(b - 2c)$\nSolving for $c$, we get $c = \\boxed{\\frac{b}{2}}$.\nSo the value of $c$ in terms of $b$ is $\\frac{b}{2}$.\nThe answer is: \\frac{b}{2}",
        "The roots of the quadratic equation $x^2 + bx + c = 0$ are given by the quadratic formula: \\[\nx = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4c}}{2}.\n\\] The difference between the roots is then \\[\n\\left| \\frac{-b + \\sqrt{b^2 - 4c}}{2} - \\frac{-b - \\sqrt{b^2 - 4c}}{2} \\right| = |2\\sqrt{c}| = 2|c|^{1/2}.\n\\] Since $c \\neq 0$, we can divide both sides of this equation by $2$ to get \\[\n|c|^{1/2} = \\frac{|b - 2c|}{2}.\n\\] Squaring both sides, we get \\[\nc = \\frac{(b - 2c)^2}{4}.\n\\] Expanding, we get \\[\nc = \\frac{b^2 - 4bc + 4c^2}{4}.\n\\] Multiplying both sides by 4, we get \\[\n4c = b^2 - 4bc + 4c^2.\n\\] Rearranging, we get \\[\n4c - 4c^2 = b^2 - 4bc.\n\\] Dividing both sides by 4, we get \\[\nc - c^2 = \\frac{b^2}{4} - \\frac{bc}{2}.\n\\] Rearranging and factoring, we get \\[\nc(1 - c) = \\frac{b^2}{4} - \\frac{bc}{2}.\n\\] Since $c \\neq 0$, we can divide both sides by $c$ to get \\[\n1 - c = \\frac{b^2}{4c} - \\frac{b}{2}.\n\\] Rearranging, we get \\[\nc = \\frac{b^2}{4c} - \\frac{b}{2} - 1.\n\\] Multiplying both sides by 4, we get \\[\n4c = 4 \\cdot \\frac{b^2}{4c} - 4 \\cdot \\frac{b}{2} - 4.\n\\] Simplifying, we get \\[\n4c = b^2 - ",
