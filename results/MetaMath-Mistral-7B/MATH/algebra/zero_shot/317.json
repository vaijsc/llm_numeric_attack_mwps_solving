Then the first and last integers are $x-2$ and $x+2$, respectively.\nThe sum of the five consecutive integers is $(x-2) + (x-1) + x + (x+1) + (x+2) = 5$.\nSimplifying, we get $5x = 5$, so $x=1$.\nTherefore, the five integers are $-2$, $1$, $2$, $3$, and $4$.\nThe product of these integers is $(-2)(1)(2)(3)(4) = \\boxed{-24}$.The answer is: -24",
        "Let the five consecutive integers be $n-2$, $n-1$, $n$, $n+1$, and $n+2$.\nThe sum of these integers is $(n-2) + (n-1) + n + (n+1) + (n+2) = 5n$.\nWe are given that the sum is five, so $5n = 5$.\nDividing both sides by 5, we find $n = 1$.\nThe product of the five integers is $(n-2)(n-1)(n)(n+1)(n+2) = (1-2)(1-1)(1)(1+1)(1+2) = (1)(1)(1)(2)(3) = \\boxed{6}$.\nThe answer is: 6",
        "Let the five consecutive integers be $x,$ $x+1,$ $x+2,$ $x+3,$ and $x+4$.\nThe sum of these integers is $5x+10$.\nWe are given that this sum is 5, so we have $5x+10=5$.\nSolving for $x$, we find $x=0$.\nThe product of the five integers is $(x)(x+1)(x+2)(x+3)(x+4)=0(1)(2)(3)(4)=\\boxed{0}$.\nThe answer is: 0"
