    "solution": "We can split the expression $|5x-1|=x+3$ into two separate cases. In the first case, \\begin{align*} 5x-1&=x+3\n\\\\\\Rightarrow \\qquad 4x&=4\n\\\\\\Rightarrow \\qquad x&=1\n\\end{align*}If we plug this value of $x$ back into the original equation in order to check our answer, we see that $|5(1)-1|=1+3$ or $4=4$.
