        "Since $h(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $5$, the degree of $g(x)$ must be $5 - 2 = 3$.\nHence, $b = \\boxed{3}$.\nThe answer is: 3",
        "Since $h(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $5$,\nthe highest power of $x$ in $h(x)$ is $5$.\nExpanding $(x^2-7x+10) \\cdot g(x)$,\nwe see that the highest power of $x$ is $2+b$,\nwhere $b$ is the degree of $g(x)$.\nSince the highest power of $x$ in $h(x)$ is $5$,\nwe must have $2+b=5$.\nSolving $2+b=5$ gives us $b=\\boxed{3}$.\nThe answer is: 3",
        "The polynomial $h(x)$ has degree $5$, so the polynomial $g(x)$ must have degree greater than $5$.\nWe can see that the polynomial $h(x)$ is a quadratic polynomial multiplied by $g(x)$.\nThis means that $g(x)$ must have degree $5+1=6$.\nTherefore, the value of $b$ is $\\boxed{6}$.\nThe answer is: 6"
