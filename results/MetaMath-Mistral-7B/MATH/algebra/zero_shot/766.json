        "We won $2/9$ of our games this season. \nLet's say we played a total of $x$ games this year. \nThis means we won $(2/9)(x)$ games and lost $(x - (2/9)(x))$ games. \nWe also know that we lost 15 more games than we won. \nTherefore, $(x - (2/9)(x)) = (2/9)(x) + 15$. \nSimplifying, we get $x - (2/9)(x) = (2/9)(x) + 15$. \nMultiplying both sides of the equation by 9 to eliminate the fraction, we get $9x - 2x = 2x + 135$. \nSimplifying further, we get $7x = 135$. \nDividing both sides of the equation by 7, we find $x = 19$. \nTherefore, our baseball team played $\\boxed{19}$ games this year.\nThe answer is: 19",
