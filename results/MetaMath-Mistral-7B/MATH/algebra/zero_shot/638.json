        "We can use the difference of squares to calculate $42^2$ and $38^2$. \nThe difference of squares allows us to write $42^2$ and $38^2$ as $(40+2)^2$ and $(40-2)^2$ respectively. \nWe know that $(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$. \nSo, $(40+2)^2 = 40^2 + 2(40)(2) + 2^2$. \nCalculating, we find that $(40+2)^2 = 1600 + 160 + 4 = 1764$. \nSimilarly, $(40-2)^2 = 40^2 - 2(40)(2) + 2^2$. \nCalculating, we find that $(40-2)^2 = 1600 - 160 + 4 = 1444$. \nTo find the number that Emily subtracts, we need to find the difference between $1764$ and $1444$. \nThis difference is $1764 - 1444 = \\boxed{320}$. \nThe answer is: 320",
        "\nTo calculate $42^2$, Emily knows that $40^2$ is close to $42^2$. \nSo, she mentally figures the value $40^2$, which is $1600$.\nThen, she adds $164$ to calculate $42^2$. \nTherefore, $42^2$ is equal to $1600 + 164 = 1764$.\nNow, let's find the number that Emily subtracts to calculate $38^2$.\nWe know that $38$ is $2$ less than $40$, so $38^2$ is $2$ less than $40^2$.\nTherefore, Emily subtracts $\\boxed{2}$ to calculate $38^2$.\nThe answer is: 2",
        "We know that $42^2 = 1846$.\nWe also know that $40^2 = 1600$.\nSo, Emily figures the value $1600$ and adds $164$ to calculate $42^2$.\nTherefore, she adds $164$ to $1600$ to get $1764$.\nNow, let's calculate $38^2$.\nWe know that $38^2 = 1444$.\nEmily subtracts a number from $40^2$ to calculate $38^2$.\nSo, she subtracts $1444 - 1600 = \\boxed{156}$.\nThe answer is: 156",
        "\nTo calculate $42^2$, Emily mentally figures the value $40^2$ and adds 164.\nSo, $42^2 = 40^2 + 164$.\nTo calculate $38^2$, Emily subtracts a number from $40^2$.\nSo, $38^2 = 40^2 - x$, where $x$ is the number that Emily subtracts.\nFrom these equations, we can observe that $164 = 40^2 - 38^2$.\nUsing the difference of squares formula, we have $40^2 - 38^2 = (40 + 38)(40 - 38)$.\nSimplifying, we get $164 = 78 \\times 2$.\nTherefore, the number that Emily subtracts is $\\boxed{76}$.The answer is: 76",
        "To calculate $42^2$, Emily mentally figures the value $40^2$ and adds $164$.\nThis means that $40^2 + 164 = 42^2$.\nTo calculate $38^2$, Emily subtracts a number from $40^2$.\nLet's call this number $x$.\nSo, $40^2 - x = 38^2$.\nWe can simplify this equation to $1600 - x = 1444$.\nSubtracting 1444 from both sides, we get $x = \\boxed{156}$.\nThe answer is: 156",
        "We know that $(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$.\nEmily calculated $42^2$ by using this formula.\nLet $x$ be the number she subtracts from $40^2$ to calculate $38^2$.\nThen we have $(40+x)^2 = 38^2$.\nExpanding, we get $1600 + 80x + x^2 = 1444$.\nRearranging, we have $x^2 + 80x + 160 = 0$.\nWe can factor this as $(x+40)(x+40) = 0$.\nSo the only possible value for $x$ is $-40$.\nSince Emily subtracts a number from $40^2$ to calculate $38^2$, the answer is $\\boxed{-40}$.The answer is: -40"
