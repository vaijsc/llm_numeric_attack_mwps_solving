        "\nThe bank account compounds 3 percent annually. This means that each year, the amount in the account increases by 3 percent. \nAfter 10 years, the amount in the account will have increased by 3 percent each year for 10 years. \nWe can calculate this by multiplying the initial amount by (1 + 0.03)^10. \nSo, the amount in Alan's bank account after 10 years is 500 * (1 + 0.03)^10. \nCalculating this, we get approximately 500 * 1.338225. \nMultiplying, we get approximately 669.11. \nRounding to the nearest dollar, the amount in Alan's bank account after 10 years is $669. \n#### 669\nThe answer is: 669",
        "Since the bank account compounds 3 percent annually, that means the amount in the account increases by 3 percent each year.\nAfter 10 years, the amount in the account will have increased by 3 percent each year for 10 years.\nTo find the amount in the account after 10 years, we can use the formula for compound interest:\nAmount = Principal * (1 + Interest rate)^Number of years\nIn this case, the Principal is 500 dollars, the Interest rate is 3 percent (or 0.03), and the Number of years is 10.\nUsing the formula, we find that the amount in the account after 10 years is 500 * (1 + 0.03)^10 = 500 * 1.33822 = 669.11.\nRounding to the nearest dollar, the amount in Alan's bank account after 10 years is 669 dollars.\nThe answer is: 669",
        "The formula for calculating the compound interest is:\nA = P(1 + r/n)^(nt),\nWhere:\nA is the final amount\nP is the initial amount\nr is the annual interest rate (as a decimal)\nn is the number of times that interest is compounded per year\nt is the number of years\nIn this case, Alan saved $500 with an annual interest rate of 3% (or 0.03 as a decimal) and interest is compounded annually for 10 years.\nUsing the formula, we have:\nA = 500(1 + 0.03/1)^(1*10)\nA = 500(1 + 0.03)^10\nA = 500(1.03)^10\nCalculating this, we get:\nA = 500(1.32905)\nA = 664.525\nRounding to the nearest dollar, the final amount in Alan's bank account after 10 years is $664.\nThe answer is: 664",
        "The formula to calculate compound interest is:\nA = P(1 + r)^n,\nwhere A is the final amount, P is the principal amount (initial deposit), r is the interest rate (expressed as a decimal), and n is the number of compounding periods.\nIn this case, Alan saved $500 and the interest rate is 3% (or 0.03 as a decimal).\nWe want to find the amount in Alan's bank account after 10 years, so n is 10.\nUsing the formula, we have:\nA = 500(1 + 0.03)^10\nA \u2248 500(1.03)^10\nA \u2248 500(1.32506906)\nA \u2248 662.52\nTherefore, after 10 years, there will be approximately $662.52 in Alan's bank account.\nThe answer is: 663",
        "Since the bank account compounds 3 percent annually, the amount in Alan's bank account after 10 years will be $500 \\cdot (1 + 0.03)^{10}$ dollars.\nCalculating this using a calculator, we find that the amount is approximately $\\boxed{661}$ dollars.\nThe answer is: 661"
