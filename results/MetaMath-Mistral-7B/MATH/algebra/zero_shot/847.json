        "The equation of the line passing through the point $(20,30)$ is given by $y=1.5x$.\nTo find out how many meters Caroline will walk in exactly one hour, we need to substitute $x=3600$ seconds (which is equal to one hour) into this equation.\nSo, $y = 1.5(3600) = 5400$ meters.\nTherefore, Caroline will walk $\\boxed{5400}$ meters in exactly one hour.The answer is: 5400",
        "We are given that the graph passes through the point $(20,30)$.\nThis means that when Caroline walks for 20 seconds, she is 30 meters away from her starting point.\nWe can use this information to find the equation of the line.\nThe slope of the line is the rate at which the distance increases with respect to time.\nSo, the slope is $\\frac{30}{20}=1.5$.\nSince the line passes through the point $(20,30)$, we can use the point-slope form of a line to find the equation:\n$y-30=1.5(x-20)$.\nSimplifying, we have $y=1.5x-30$.\nNow, we can use this equation to find the distance Caroline will walk in one hour.\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour and 60 seconds in a minute, we have $x=60\\times60=3600$.\nSubstituting into the equation, we have $y=1.5(3600)-30=5400-30=5370$.\nTherefore, Caroline will walk $\\boxed{5370}$ meters in one hour.The answer is: 5370",
        "We can see from the graph that the equation of the line is $y = 1.5x$.\nTo find the distance Caroline will walk in one hour, we need to find the value of $y$ when $x$ is equal to 3600 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour and 3600 seconds in an hour).\nSubstituting $x = 3600$ into the equation, we get $y = 1.5(3600) = 5400$.\nTherefore, Caroline will walk $\\boxed{5400}$ meters in exactly one hour.The answer is: 5400",
        "The graph passes through the point $(20,30)$.\nThis means that when Caroline walks for 20 seconds, she is 30 meters away from her starting point.\nSince the graph is a straight line, we can find the rate of change or slope of the line.\nThe slope of the line is $y=1.5x$.\nTo find the distance Caroline will walk in one hour, we can use the formula distance = rate $\\times$ time.\nThe rate is 1.5 meters per second, and the time is 3600 seconds (one hour).\nTherefore, the distance Caroline will walk in one hour is $1.5 \\times 3600 = \\boxed{5400}$ meters.The answer is: 5400",
        "From the graph, we can see that the equation of the line is $y=1.5x$.\nWe want to find the distance Caroline will walk in one hour, which is equal to the distance at $x=60$ (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).\nPlugging $x=60$ into the equation, we get $y=1.5(60)=90$.\nTherefore, Caroline will walk $\\boxed{90}$ meters in one hour.\nThe answer is: 90"
