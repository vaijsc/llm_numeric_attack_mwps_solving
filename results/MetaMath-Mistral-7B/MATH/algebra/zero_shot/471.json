        "If six cookies cost the same as 2 brownies, then 18 cookies will cost the same as $(2/6) \\cdot 18 = 6$ brownies.\nAnd if four brownies cost the same as 10 cupcakes, then 6 brownies will cost the same as $(10/4) \\cdot 6 = 15$ cupcakes.\nTherefore, Bob can buy $\\boxed{15}$ cupcakes for the price of eighteen cookies.The answer is: 15",
        "We know that 6 cookies cost the same as 2 brownies.\nSo, 1 cookie costs the same as 2/6 = 1/3 of a brownie.\nWe also know that 4 brownies cost the same as 10 cupcakes.\nSo, 1 brownie costs the same as 10/4 = 2.5 cupcakes.\nTherefore, 1 cookie costs the same as 1/3 * 2.5 = 1.67 cupcakes.\nIf Bob wants to buy 18 cookies, he would need to pay for 18 * 1.67 = 30.02 cupcakes.\nSince Bob cannot buy a fraction of a cupcake, he can buy \\boxed{30} cupcakes for the price of eighteen cookies.\nThe answer is: 30",
        "If 6 cookies cost the same as 2 brownies, then 1 cookie costs the same as 2/6 = 1/3 of a brownie.\nIf 4 brownies cost the same as 10 cupcakes, then 1 brownie costs the same as 10/4 = 2.5 cupcakes.\nSo, 1 cookie costs 1/3 * 2.5 = 0.6667 cupcakes.\nTherefore, Bob can buy 0.6667 * 18 = 11.9998 cupcakes for the price of eighteen cookies.\nSince we can\u2019t buy a fraction of a cupcake, Bob can buy a maximum of $\\boxed{11}$ cupcakes.\nThe answer is: 11",
        "We know that six cookies cost the same as 2 brownies. So, the price of 1 cookie is $\\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}$ of the price of 1 brownie.\nWe also know that four brownies cost the same as 10 cupcakes. So, the price of 1 brownie is $\\frac{10}{4} = \\frac{5}{2}$ of the price of 1 cupcake.\nTherefore, the price of 1 cookie is $\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{5}{2} = \\frac{5}{6}$ of the price of 1 cupcake.\nIf Bob wants to buy 18 cookies, he would spend $\\frac{5}{6} \\cdot 18 = 15$ cupcakes.\nSo, Bob can buy $\\boxed{15}$ cupcakes for the price of eighteen cookies.The answer is: 15",
        "From the information given, we know that 6 cookies = 2 brownies and 4 brownies = 10 cupcakes.\nTo find out how many cupcakes Bob can buy for the price of 18 cookies, we need to find the ratio.\nFirst, let's find the ratio of cookies to brownies:\n6 cookies / 2 brownies = 3 cookies/brownie\nNext, let's find the ratio of brownies to cupcakes:\n4 brownies / 10 cupcakes = 2/5 brownies/cupcake\nNow, let's combine the ratios to find the ratio of cookies to cupcakes:\n3 cookies/brownie * 2/5 brownies/cupcake = 6/5 cookies/cupcake\nThis means that for every 6 cookies, Bob can buy 5 cupcakes.\nTo find out how many cupcakes Bob can buy for the price of 18 cookies, we can set up the proportion:\n18 cookies / x cupcakes = 6/5\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n18 * 5 = 6 * x\n90 = 6x\nDividing both sides by 6, we find:\nx = 15\nTherefore, Bob can buy 15 cupcakes for the price of 18 cookies.\nThe answer is: 15"
