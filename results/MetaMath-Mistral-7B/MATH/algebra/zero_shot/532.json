        "The clock strikes 1 chime at 1 o'clock, 2 chimes at 2 o'clock, and so on.\nSo, at 12 o'clock, the clock would strike 12 chimes (one for each hour).\nAt 1 o'clock, the clock would strike 1 chime.\nAt 2 o'clock, the clock would strike 2 chimes.\nAnd so on, until 12 o'clock the next day.\nSo, the total number of chimes the clock will strike in a twelve-hour period is $1 + 2 + 3 + \\ldots + 12 + 1 + 2 + 3 + \\ldots + 12 = 2(1 + 2 + 3 + \\ldots + 12)$.\nThe sum of the first 12 positive integers is $\\frac{12(12 + 1)}{2} = 78$.\nTherefore, the total number of chimes the clock will strike in a twelve-hour period is $2(78) = \\boxed{156}$.\nThe answer is: 156",
        "\nThe chime clock strikes 1 chime at one o'clock, 2 chimes at two o'clock, 3 chimes at three o'clock, and so on. So the number of chimes at each hour is equal to the hour itself.\nIn a twelve-hour period, the clock will strike 1 chime at each of the twelve hours. Therefore, the total number of chimes is equal to the sum of the first twelve positive integers.\nThe sum of the first twelve positive integers can be found using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, which is given by the formula:\nSum = (number of terms)/2 * (first term + last term)\nIn this case, the number of terms is 12, the first term is 1, and the last term is 12.\nSo the sum of the first twelve positive integers is (12)/2 * (1 + 12) = 6 * 13 = 78.\nTherefore, the total number of chimes the clock will strike in a twelve-hour period is 78.\nThe answer is: 78",
        "The clock strikes 1 chime at one o'clock, 2 chimes at two o'clock, and so on.\nSo, at each hour, the clock strikes the number of chimes that is equal to the hour itself.\nIn a twelve-hour period, the clock will strike 1 chime at 1 o'clock, 2 chimes at 2 o'clock, 3 chimes at 3 o'clock, and so on, up to 12 chimes at 12 o'clock.\nTo find the total number of chimes in a twelve-hour period, we can add up the number of chimes for each hour:\n\\[1 + 2 + 3 + \\dots + 12 = \\frac{12 \\cdot 13}{2} = 78.\\]\nTherefore, the clock will strike a total of $\\boxed{78}$ chimes in a twelve-hour period.The answer is: 78",
        "The clock strikes 1 chime at one o'clock, 2 chimes at two o'clock, 3 chimes at three o'clock, and so on.\nSo, the number of chimes the clock strikes increases by 1 each hour.\nIn 12 hours, the clock will strike 1, 2, 3, ..., 12 chimes.\nTo find the total number of chimes, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: $S = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$, where $S$ is the sum, $n$ is the number of terms, $a_1$ is the first term, and $a_n$ is the last term.\nIn this case, $n = 12$, $a_1 = 1$, and $a_n = 12$.\nPlugging in these values, we get $S = \\frac{12}{2}(1 + 12) = 6(13) = \\boxed{78}$.\nThe answer is: 78",
        "The chime clock strikes 1 chime at one o'clock, so it strikes 1 chime in the first hour.\nIt strikes 2 chimes at two o'clock, so it strikes 2 chimes in the second hour.\nIt continues this pattern, striking 3 chimes at three o'clock, 4 chimes at four o'clock, and so on.\nWe can see that the number of chimes the clock strikes in each hour is equal to the hour number.\nTherefore, the total number of chimes the clock will strike in a twelve-hour period is $1+2+3+4+...+12$.\nThis is an arithmetic series with first term 1, common difference 1, and twelve terms.\nThe sum of an arithmetic series is given by the formula $S = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$, where $S$ is the sum, $n$ is the number of terms, $a_1$ is the first term, and $a_n$ is the last term.\nPlugging in the values, we have $S = \\frac{12}{2}(1 + 12) = \\frac{12}{2}(13) = 6(13) = \\boxed{78}$.\nThe answer is: 78",
