        "To determine the values of \\( b \\) such that the graph of the quadratic equation \\( y = ax^2 + bx - 6 \\) is completely below the \\( x \\)-axis, we start with the conditions fulfilled by the coefficients \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n1. **Understanding the Quadratic Equation**:\n   The parabola given by \\( y = ax^2 + bx - 6 \\) opens upwards if \\( a > 0 \\) and opens downwards if \\( a < 0 \\). For our parabola to lie completely below the \\( x \\)-axis, we want the roots (if they exist) to be complex, since this ensures that the parabola does not cross the \\( x \\)-axis.\n2. **Condition for No Real Roots**:\n   For the quadratic to have no real roots, the discriminant must be negative:\n   \\[\n   D = b^2 - 4ac < 0\n   \\]\n   In our case, the coefficients are:\n   - \\( a = a \\)\n   - \\( b = b \\)\n   - \\( c = -6 \\)\n   This gives us:\n   \\[\n   D = b^2 - 4a(-6) = b^2 + 24a < 0\n   \\]\n3. **Substituting \\( a^2 = 49 \\)**:\n   The problem states \\( a^2 = 49 \\), which means we have two possible values for \\( a \\):\n   \\[\n   a = 7 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad a = -7\n   \\]\n   - **Case 1**: \\( a = 7 \\)\n     \\[\n     D = b^2 + 24(7) = b^2 + 168 < 0\n     \\]\n     Since \\( b^2 \\) is always non-negative, \\( b^2 + 168 \\) can never be less than zero, which means there are no valid \\( b \\) values when \\( a = 7 \\).\n   - **Case 2**: \\( a = -7 \\)\n     \\[\n     D = b^2 + 24(-7) = b^2 - 168 < 0\n     \\]\n     This simplifies to:\n     \\[\n     b^2 < 168\n     \\]\n     To find the largest possible integral value of \\( b \\), we take the square root:\n     \\[\n     |b| < \\sqrt{168} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad |b| < 4\\sqrt{10} \\approx 12.49\n     \\]\n     This means \\( b \\) can take integral values from \\( -12 \\) to \\( 12 \\).\n4. **Finding the Largest Integral Value of \\( b \\)**:\n   Since we are asked for the largest integral value of \\( b \\), the maximum value is:\n   \\[\n   b = 12\n   \\]\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   To verify if this value keeps the quadratic entirely below the \\( x \\)-axis:\n   \\[\n   D = 12^2 - 168 = 144 - 168 = -24 < 0\n   \\]\n   Hence, it satisfies the condition that the quadratic lies entirely below the \\( x \\)-axis.\nThus, the largest possible integral value of \\( b \\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{12}\n\\]",
