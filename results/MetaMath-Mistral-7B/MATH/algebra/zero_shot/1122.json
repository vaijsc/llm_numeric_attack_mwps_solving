        "Given the quadratic equation \\(2x^2 + 4x - 1 = 0\\), we want to find the sum of the squares of its solutions. \nLet the roots of the equation be denoted as \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\). According to the formula for the sum of the squares of the roots, we can express it as:\n\\[\nx_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2\n\\]\nNow, we can use Vieta's formulas which relate the coefficients of the polynomial to the sums and products of the roots.

        "To find the sum of the squares of the solutions to the quadratic equation \\(2x^2 + 4x - 1 = 0\\), we can start by identifying the solutions using the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula states that for any equation of the form \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), the solutions for \\(x\\) can be found using:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\nIn our equation, we have \\(a = 2\\), \\(b = 4\\), and \\(c = -1\\). Plugging these values into the quadratic formula results in:\n1. First, we calculate the discriminant:\n\\[\nb^2 - 4ac = 4^2 - 4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot (-1) = 16 + 8 = 24\n\\]\n2. Now substituting \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and the discriminant into the quadratic formula:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{24}}{2 \\cdot 2} = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{24}}{4}\n\\]\n3. We can simplify \\(\\sqrt{24}\\) as follows:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{24} = \\sqrt{4 \\cdot 6} = 2\\sqrt{6}\n\\]\n4. Therefore, we substitute back into the expression for \\(x\\):\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{6}}{4} = \\frac{-4}{4} \\pm \\frac{2\\sqrt{6}}{4} = -1 \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{2}\n\\]\n5. Thus, the two solutions are:\n\\[\nx_1 = -1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{2}, \\quad x_2 = -1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{2}\n\\]\nNext, we need to find the sum of the squares of these solutions, \\(x_1^2 + x_2^2\\). We can use the identity:\n\\[\nx_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2\n\\]\n6. From Vieta's formulas, we know:\n- The sum of the solutions \\(x_1 + x_2 = -\\frac{b}{a} = -\\frac{4}{2} = -2\\)\n- The product of the solutions \\(x_1 x_2 = \\frac{c}{a} = \\frac{-1}{2}\\)\n7. We can now substitute these values into our squared sum formula:\n\\[\nx_1^2 + x_2^2 = (-2)^2 - 2\\left(\\frac{-1}{2}\\right)\n\\]\nCalculating this gives:\n\\[\nx_1^2 + x_2^2 = 4 + 1 = 5\n\\]\nThus, the sum of the squares of the solutions to the equation \\(2x^2 + 4x - 1 = 0\\) is \n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]",
