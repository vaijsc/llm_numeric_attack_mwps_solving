        "The function $h(x) = \\sqrt{25-x^2}+\\sqrt{-(x-2)}$ is defined only when both square roots are defined.\nThe square root of a nonnegative number is defined, so $25-x^2\\ge 0$ implies $x^2\\le 25$, or $-5\\le x\\le 5$.\nThe square root of a nonpositive number is not defined, so $-(x-2)\\le 0$ implies $x\\ge 2$.\nTherefore, the domain of $h(x)$ is the interval $\\boxed{[2,5]}$.The answer is: [2,5]",
        "To find the width of the domain of the function $h(x)$, we need to determine the range of values of $x$ for which the function is defined.\nThe square root function $\\sqrt{x}$ is defined only for non-negative values of $x$.\nSo, for $h(x) = \\sqrt{25-x^2}$, the expression under the square root must be non-negative.\nThis means $25-x^2 \\ge 0$, which simplifies to $x^2 \\le 25$.\nThe range of values of $x$ that satisfy this inequality is $x \\in [-5, 5]$.\nNext, for $h(x) = \\sqrt{-(x-2)}$, the expression under the square root must be non-negative.\nThis means $-(x-2) \\ge 0$, which simplifies to $x \\le 2$.\nThe range of values of $x$ that satisfy this inequality is $x \\in [-5, 2]$.\nSince we are looking for the width of the domain, we subtract the lower bound from the upper bound: $5-(-5) = 10$.\nTherefore, the domain of the function $h(x)$ has a width of $\\boxed{10}$. \nThe answer is: 10",
        "The expression under the first square root must be nonnegative and less than or equal to 25.\nThis gives us $-5 \\leq x \\leq 5$.\nThe expression under the second square root must always be nonnegative, so there are no additional restrictions on $x$.\nThus, the domain of $h(x)$ is the interval $[-5, 5]$ with width $5-(-5) = \\boxed{10}$.\nThe answer is: 10"
