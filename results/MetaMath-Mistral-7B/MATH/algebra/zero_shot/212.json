        "To solve the expression \\( 19^2 + 2(19) + 1 \\), we can first identify that this expression resembles the expansion of a perfect square. The expression can be recognized as follows:\n\\[\n(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\n\\]\nFor our expression, we can set \\( a = 19 \\) and \\( b = 1 \\). Applying this to our expression:\n\\[\n19^2 + 2(19)(1) + 1^2 = (19 + 1)^2\n\\]\nThis means we can rewrite the original expression as:\n\\[\n(19 + 1)^2 = 20^2\n\\]\nNow we calculate \\( 20^2 \\):\n\\[\n20^2 = 400\n\\]\nTherefore, the value of \\( 19^2 + 2(19) + 1 \\) is \\( \\boxed{400} \\). \nTo confirm, let\u2019s compute each term separately:\n1. Calculate \\( 19^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   19 \\times 19 = 361\n   \\]\n2. Calculate \\( 2(19) \\):\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 19 = 38\n   \\]\n3.
