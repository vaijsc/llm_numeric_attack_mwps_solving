        "We can start by cross multiplying the equations to get $2 \\cdot 60 = A \\cdot B$ and $5 \\cdot 60 = A \\cdot B$.\nSimplifying, we have $120 = A \\cdot B$ and $300 = A \\cdot B$.\nSince $A \\cdot B = 120$ and $A \\cdot B = 300$, we can see that $A = 20$ and $B = 6$.\nTherefore, $A + B = 20 + 6 = \\boxed{26}$.\nThe answer is: 26",
        "We are given three proportions: $\\frac 25 = \\frac A{60}$, $\\frac 25 = \\frac {60}B$, and $\\frac A{60} = \\frac {60}B$.\nFrom the first two proportions, we can cross-multiply to get $2 \\cdot 60 = 5A$ and $5 \\cdot 60 = 2B$.\nSimplifying these equations, we have $120 = 5A$ and $300 = 2B$.\nSolving for $A$ and $B$, we find $A = 24$ and $B = 150$.\nFinally, we can find $A + B = 24 + 150 = \\boxed{174}$.\nThe answer is: 174",
        "First, we can cross multiply to find that $2 \\cdot B = 60 \\cdot 5$, or $B = 300$.\nThen, we can substitute this value back into the equation $\\frac A{60} = \\frac 25$ to find that $A = \\frac{(2 \\cdot 60)}{5} = 24$.\nFinally, we can find that $A + B = 24 + 300 = \\boxed{324}$.\nThe answer is: 324",
        "We can write $\\frac 25$ as $\\frac{2}{5}$ or $\\frac{4}{10}$.\nWe can write $\\frac A{60}$ as $\\frac{A}{60}$.\nWe can write $\\frac {60}B$ as $\\frac{60}{B}$.\nSetting the fractions equal, we have $\\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{A}{60} = \\frac{60}{B}$.\nFrom $\\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{A}{60}$, we get $\\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{A}{60}$ and $A = \\frac{2}{5} \\cdot 60 = 24$.\nFrom $\\frac{60}{B} = \\frac{4}{10}$, we get $\\frac{60}{B} = \\frac{4}{10}$ and $B = \\frac{60}{4} = 15$.\nFinally, $A + B = 24 + 15 = \\boxed{39}$.\nThe answer is: 39",
        "We are given that $\\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{A}{60} = \\frac{60}{B}$.\nFrom the first and third equations, we can set up the equation $\\frac{2}{5} \\cdot B = \\frac{60}{A}$.\nCross-multiplying gives $2A = 5B \\cdot 60$.\nSimplifying this equation gives $2A = 300B$.\nDividing both sides by 2 gives $A = 150B$.\nSince we are looking for the value of $A + B$, we substitute $A = 150B$ into $A + B$ to get $150B + B = \\boxed{151B}$.\nThe answer is: 151"
