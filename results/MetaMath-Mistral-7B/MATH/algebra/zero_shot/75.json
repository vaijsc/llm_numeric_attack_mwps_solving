        "The equation of the parabola can be written as $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$.\nPlugging in $x = -1$, we get $a(-1)^2 + b(-1) + c = 0$ or $a - b + c = 0$.\nPlugging in $x = 0$, we get $a(0)^2 + b(0) + c = 5$ or $c = 5$.\nPlugging in $x = 5$, we get $a(5)^2 + b(5) + c = 0$ or $25a + 5b + c = 0$.\nSince $c = 5$, this becomes $25a + 5b + 5 = 0$ or $25a + 5b = -5$.\nNow we have the system of equations $a - b + c = 0$ and $25a + 5b = -5$.\nSubstituting $c = 5$, we get $a - b + 5 = 0$ and $25a + 5b = -5$.\nMultiplying the first equation by 5, we get $5a - 5b + 25 = 0$.\nAdding this to the second equation, we get $30a = -20$ or $a = -\\frac{20}{30} = -\\frac{2}{3}$.\nSubstituting this back into the second equation, we get $25\\left(-\\frac{2}{3}\\right) + 5b = -5$.\nSimplifying, we get $-\\frac{50}{3} + 5b = -5$ or $5b = -\\frac{50}{3} + 5$.\nMultiplying both sides by 3, we get $15b = -150 + 15$.\nSimplifying, we get $15b = -135$ or $b = -\\frac{135}{15} = -9$.\nFinally, substituting $a = -\\frac{2}{3}$ and $b = -9$ into the equation $a - b + c = 0$, we get $-\\frac{2}{3} - (-9)",
        "The equation of the parabola can be written as $ax^2+bx+c=0$.\nUsing the points $(-1,0)$ and $(0,5)$, we can set up a system of equations:\n$$a(-1)^2+b(-1)+c=0$$\n$$a(0)^2+b(0)+c=5$$\nSimplifying these equations, we get:\n$$-a+b+c=0$$\n$$c=5$$\nSubstituting $c=5$ into the first equation, we get:\n$$-a+b+5=0$$\n$$a-b=5$$\nUsing the point $(5,0)$, we can set up another equation:\n$$a(5)^2+b(5)+c=0$$\n$$25a+5b+5=0$$\n$$25a+5b=0$$\n$$5a+b=0$$\n$$5(a-b)=0$$\nSince $a-5\\neq0$, we must have $b=0$.\nSubstituting $b=0$ into the equations $a-b=5$ and $5(a-b)=0$, we get:\n$$a=5$$\n$$5a+5b=5b=0$$\nSince $5b=0$, we must have $b=0$.\nTherefore, the equation of the parabola is $a(x-h)^2+k=0$, where $(h,k)$ is the vertex of the parabola.\nSince the vertex is the midpoint of the arc connecting the two given points, the vertex is $\\left(\\frac{-1+0}{2},\\frac{0+5}{2}\\right)=(0,2)$.\nSo the equation of the parabola is $a(x-0)^2+2=0$, which simplifies to $ax^2+2=0$.\nTherefore, $100a+10b+c=100a+10(0)+2=100a+2$.\nSubstituting $a=5$, we get $100a+2=100(5)+2=\\boxed{502}$.\nThe answer is: 502",
        "Since the parabola contains the point $(-1,0)$, we know that the equation of the parabola can be written in the form $y = a(x + 1)^2$.\nSubstituting the other two points, we have the following equations:\n\\begin{align*}\n0 &= a(0 + 1)^2 + b(0 + 1) + c \\\\\n5 &= a(5 + 1)^2 + b(5 + 1) + c \\\\\n0 &= a(5 + 1)^2 + b(5 + 1) + c\n\\end{align*}\nSimplifying these equations gives us:\n\\begin{align*}\n1 &= a + b + c \\\\\n25 &= 36a + 6b + c \\\\\n1 &= 36a + 6b + c\n\\end{align*}\nSubtracting the first equation from the second equation gives $24 = 35a + 5b$, and subtracting the second equation from the third equation gives $-24 = -35a - 5b$.\nAdding these two equations gives $0 = 70a$, so $a = 0$.\nSubstituting $a = 0$ into the second equation gives $25 = 6b + c$.\nSubstituting $a = 0$ into the first equation gives $1 = b + c$.\nSince $a = 0$, the equation of the parabola is of the form $y = bx + c$.\nSubstituting the point $(-1,0)$ into this equation gives $c = 0$, so the equation of the parabola is $y = bx$.\nComparing this to the given equation $ax^2 + bx + c$, we can see that $a = 0$ and $b = 1$.\nTherefore, $100a + 10b + c = 100(0) + 10(1) + 0 = \\boxed{10}$.\nThe answer is: 10",
        "The parabola passes through the point $(-1,0)$, so we have the equation $a(-1)^2+b(-1)+c=0$.\nThis simplifies to $-a+b+c=0$.\nThe parabola passes through the point $(0,5)$, so we have the equation $a(0)^2+b(0)+c=5$.\nThis simplifies to $c=5$.\nThe parabola passes through the point $(5,0)$, so we have the equation $a(5)^2+b(5)+c=0$.\nThis simplifies to $25a+5b+c=0$.\nWe can substitute $c=5$ into this equation to get $25a+5b+5=0$.\nMultiplying through by 2 to get rid of fractions, we have $50a+10b+10=0$.\nSimplifying gives $50a+10b=-10$.\nMultiplying the equation $-a+b+c=0$ by 10, we get $-10a+10b+10c=0$.\nSubtracting the equation $50a+10b=-10$ from this equation gives $-60a=10$.\nDividing by $-60$ gives $a=-\\frac{1}{6}$.\nSubstituting $a=-\\frac{1}{6}$ into the equation $-a+b+c=0$ gives $-\\frac{1}{6}+b+c=0$.\nSimplifying gives $\\frac{1}{6}+b+c=0$.\nSubstituting $c=5$ into this equation gives $\\frac{1}{6}+b+5=0$.\nSimplifying gives $\\frac{1}{6}+b=-5$.\nSubtracting $\\frac{1}{6}$ from both sides gives $b=-5\\frac{1}{6}$.\nMultiplying by $-10$ gives $10b=-50$.\nSimplifying gives $b=-5$.\nFinally, substituting $a=-\\frac{1}{6}$, $b=-5$, and $c=5$ into the equation $100a+10b+c$ gives $100(-\\frac"
