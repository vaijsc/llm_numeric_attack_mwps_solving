        "The common difference between consecutive terms in an arithmetic sequence is the same.\nIn this case, the common difference is $20 - 13 = 7$.\nTo find the number of terms in this arithmetic sequence, we can find the number of times we can add 7 to 13 to reach 2008.\nSo, we have $13, 20, 27, 34, \\dots, 2008$.\nDividing each term by 7, we get $13/7, 20/7, 27/7, 34/7, \\dots, 2008/7$.\nThese are the positions of the terms in the sequence when we list them from smallest to largest.\nThe number of positions is equal to the number of terms in the sequence.\nTo find the number of terms, we count the positions.\nWe can see that $13/7, 20/7, 27/7, 34/7, \\dots, 2008/7$ are integers when $13/7, 20/7, 27/7, 34/7, \\dots, 2008/7$ are integers.\nThis occurs when the numerator is divisible by 7.\nThe numerators of these integers are $13, 20, 27, 34, \\dots, 2008$ and the common difference is 7.\nWe want to find the number of terms in this sequence.\nTo find the last term, we solve the equation $13 + 7n = 2008$, where n is the number of terms.\nSubtracting 13 from both sides gives $7n = 1995$.\nDividing both sides by 7 gives $n = 285$.\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{285}$ integers in the arithmetic sequence.The answer is: 285",
        "The common difference of this arithmetic sequence is $20 - 13 = 7$.\nWe can find the number of terms using the formula for the $n$th term of an arithmetic sequence:\n$a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$, where $a_n$ is the $n$th term, $a_1$ is the first term, and $d$ is the common difference.\nWe want to find the value of $n$ when $a_n = 2008$.\n$2008 = 13 + (n-1)(7)$\n$2008 = 13 + 7n - 7$\n$2008 = 7n + 6$\n$7n = 2002$\n$n = \\dfrac{2002}{7}$\nSince $n$ must be an integer, $n$ must be a multiple of 7.\nThe largest multiple of 7 less than or equal to 2008 is $2008 = 7 \\times 286$.\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{286}$ integers in this arithmetic sequence.The answer is: 286",
        "The common difference of this arithmetic sequence is $20-13=7$.\nTo find the number of terms, we need to find the number of multiples of 7 between 13 and 2008.\nWe divide 2008 by 7 and get 287 with a remainder of 0. This means there are 287 multiples of 7 from 13 to 2008.\nHowever, we also need to consider the first term, 13.\nSince 13 is not a multiple of 7, it is an additional term.\nTherefore, there are a total of $\\boxed{288}$ integers in this arithmetic sequence.\nThe answer is: 288",
