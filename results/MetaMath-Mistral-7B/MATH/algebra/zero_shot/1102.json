        "To complete the square, we want to rewrite the quadratic in the form $(x+m)^2 - (\\text{constant})$.\nExpanding $(x+m)^2$, we have $x^2 + 2mx + m^2$.\nComparing this to the given quadratic $x^2 + bx + 1$, we see that $b$ must be equal to $2m$.\nThe constant term in the expanded form must be equal to $1$, so we have $m^2 - 63 = 1$.\nSolving for $m$, we find $m = \\pm \\sqrt{64} = \\pm 8$.\nTherefore, $b = 2m = 2(\\pm 8) = \\boxed{\\pm 16}$.\nThe answer is: 16",
        "Expanding $(x+m)^2-63$, we have $x^2 + 2mx + m^2 - 63$.\nComparing this with the given quadratic $x^2 + bx + 1$, we can see that $2mx = bx$ and $m^2 - 63 = 1$.\nFrom $2mx = bx$, we can conclude that $2m = b$, since $x$ can be any value.\nFrom $m^2 - 63 = 1$, we can solve for $m$ by adding 63 to both sides: $m^2 = 64$.\nTaking the square root of both sides, we have $m = \\pm 8$.\nSince $b$ must be positive and $2m = b$, we conclude that $b = \\boxed{16}$.\nThe answer is: 16",
        "We have the quadratic $x^2 + bx + 1$ and we want to rewrite it in the form $(x + m)^2 - 63$.\nTo complete the square, we add and subtract $(b/2)^2$ inside the parentheses: \\[\nx^2 + bx + 1 = (x^2 + bx) + 1 = (x^2 + bx + (b/2)^2) - (b/2)^2 + 1.\n\\] This can be rewritten as \\[\n((x + b/2)^2) - (b/2)^2 + 1.\n\\] Comparing this to $(x + m)^2 - 63$, we see that $m = b/2$ and $63 = (b/2)^2 + 1$.\nSimplifying the equation $(b/2)^2 + 1 = 63$, we get $(b/2)^2 = 62$ or $b/2 = \\pm \\sqrt{62}$.\nSince $b$ is a positive number, we have $b/2 = \\sqrt{62}$.\nTherefore, $b = \\boxed{124}$.\nThe answer is: 124",
        "We can expand $(x+m)^2-63$ to get $x^2+2mx+m^2-63$.\nWe want this to be equivalent to $x^2+bx+1$.\nComparing coefficients, we have $2m=b$ and $m^2-63=1$.\nThe second equation gives us $m^2=64$, so $m=8$ (since $m$ is positive).\nTherefore, $b=2m=2(8)=\\boxed{16}$.\nThe answer is: 16",
        "To rewrite the quadratic in the form $(x+m)^2-63$, we need to complete the square.\nExpanding the square, we have $(x+m)^2=x^2+2mx+m^2$.\nSo, we want $2mx$ to be equal to $bx$ and $m^2$ to be equal to 1.\nComparing coefficients, we have $2m=b$ and $m^2=1$.\nSince $b$ is a positive number, we can conclude that $m=1/2$.\nTherefore, $b=2m=2(1/2)=\\boxed{1}$.\nThe answer is: 1",
        "To rewrite the quadratic $x^2+bx+1$ as $(x+m)^2-63$,\nwe can expand the square on the right side: $(x+m)^2=x^2+2mx+m^2$.\nSo, we need to choose $m$ and $b$ so that $x^2+bx+1=x^2+2mx+m^2-63$.\nIn other words, we want to solve the equation $b=2m$ and $1=m^2-63$.\nFrom the second equation, we have $m^2=64$, which means $m=\\pm 8$.\nSince $b=2m$, we have $b=\\boxed{16}$.\nThe answer is: 16",
        "We start with the quadratic $x^2 + bx + 1$.\nTo complete the square, we need to add and subtract $(b/2)^2$ inside the parentheses.\nThis gives us $(x^2 + bx + (b/2)^2) - (b/2)^2 + 1$.\nWe can then rewrite the expression as $(x + b/2)^2 - (b/2)^2 + 1$.\nComparing this to $(x + m)^2 - 63$, we can see that $m = b/2$ and $-(b/2)^2 + 1 = -63$.\nSimplifying the equation $-(b/2)^2 + 1 = -63$, we have $-(b^2/4) + 1 = -63$.\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by 4, we get $-b^2 + 4 = -252$.\nAdding $b^2$ to both sides of the equation, we have $b^2 - 4 = -252$.\nAdding 4 to both sides of the equation, we get $b^2 = -248$.\nSince $b$ is a positive number, we have $b = \\boxed{16}$.\nThe answer is: 16",
        "\nTo complete the square, we can take the square root of the constant term and add it inside the parentheses. \nSo the quadratic can be rewritten as $(x+m)^2-m^2-63$, where $m$ is the coefficient of the $x$ term in the quadratic.\nTo match this form with the given expression $(x+m)^2-63$, we can see that $-m^2$ must be equal to 1.\nTherefore, $m^2=1$ and $m=\\pm 1$.\nSince $b$ is a positive number, $b=2m=2(1)=\\boxed{2}$.\nThe answer is: 2",
