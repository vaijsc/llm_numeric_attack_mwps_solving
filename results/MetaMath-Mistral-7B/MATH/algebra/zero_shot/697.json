        "Since the terms of the geometric sequence are strictly decreasing, we can write the terms of the sequence as $a, \\frac{ma}{7}, \\frac{ma^2}{49}, \\frac{ma^3}{343}, \\dots$\nFor each term, we have $\\frac{ma^{n-1}}{7^n}$\nTo find the possible integer values of $m$, we need to find the values of $m$ such that $\\frac{ma^{n-1}}{7^n}$ is an integer for all positive integers $n$.\nThis means that $\\frac{ma^{n-1}}{7^n}$ must be an integer for $n = 1, 2, 3, \\dots$\nSince $a$ is a positive number, we can see that $m$ must be a divisor of $7^n$ for all positive integers $n$.\nThe divisors of $7$ are $1$ and $7$.\nThe divisors of $7^2$ are $1, 7, 7^2 = 49$.\nThe divisors of $7^3$ are $1, 7, 7^2, 7^3 = 343$.\nAnd so on.\nTherefore, the possible integer values of $m$ are $1$ and $7$.\nThere are $\\boxed{2}$ possible integer values for $m$.The answer is: 2",
        "Since the terms of the geometric sequence are strictly decreasing,\nwe know that $m<7$.\nIf $m=1$, then the common ratio is $\\frac{1}{7}$, which means that the terms of the sequence are increasing, not decreasing.\nIf $m=2$, then the common ratio is $\\frac{2}{7}$, which means that the terms of the sequence are decreasing.\nIf $m=3$, then the common ratio is $\\frac{3}{7}$, which means that the terms of the sequence are decreasing.\nAnd so on up to $m=6$, which gives a common ratio of $\\frac{6}{7}$, again resulting in decreasing terms.\nThus, there are $\\boxed{6}$ possible integer values for $m$.\nThe answer is: 6",
        "Since the terms of the geometric sequence are decreasing, we know that $\\frac{m}{7}<1$.\nIf we let $a$ be the first term of the sequence, then the second term would be $a \\cdot \\left(\\frac{m}{7}\\right)$, the third term would be $a \\cdot \\left(\\frac{m}{7}\\right)^2$, and so on.\nIn order for the terms to be decreasing, we must have $\\left(\\frac{m}{7}\\right) < \\left(\\frac{m}{7}\\right)^2 < \\left(\\frac{m}{7}\\right)^3 < \\dotsb$.\nTaking the logarithm of both sides, we get $\\log\\left(\\frac{m}{7}\\right) < \\log\\left(\\frac{m}{7}\\right)^2 < \\log\\left(\\frac{m}{7}\\right)^3 < \\dotsb$.\nDividing by $\\log\\left(\\frac{m}{7}\\right)$, we get $1 < \\frac{m}{7} < \\left(\\frac{m}{7}\\right)^2 < \\dotsb$.\nThis means that $m$ must be greater than $7$ but less than $7^2=49$.\nSo there are $49-7-1=\\boxed{41}$ possible integer values for $m$.\nThe answer is: 41",
        "We know that after the first term, each successive term is calculated by multiplying the previous term by $\\frac{m}{7}$.\nSo, if we let the first term be $a$, the second term would be $a \\cdot \\frac{m}{7}$, the third term would be $\\left(a \\cdot \\frac{m}{7}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{m}{7}$, and so on.\nTo have strictly decreasing terms, we need $\\frac{a \\cdot \\frac{m}{7}}{a} = \\frac{m}{7} < 1$.\nSimplifying this inequality, we have $m < 7$.\nSince $m$ is an integer, the possible integer values for $m$ are $m = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6$.\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{6}$ possible integer values for $m$.\nThe answer is: 6",
        "n the geometric sequence be $a_1, a_2, a_3, \\dots$.\nWe are given that $a_1 > 0$ and that each successive term is calculated by multiplying the previous term by $\\frac{m}{7}$.\nTherefore, we have $a_2 = \\frac{m}{7}a_1$, $a_3 = \\frac{m}{7}a_2 = \\frac{m^2}{49}a_1$, and so on.\nIn general, $a_n = \\left(\\frac{m}{7}\\right)^{n-1}a_1$.\nSince the terms are strictly decreasing, we want $a_n$ to be less than $a_{n-1}$.\nThis gives us the inequality $\\left(\\frac{m}{7}\\right)^{n-1}a_1 < \\left(\\frac{m}{7}\\right)^{n-2}a_1$.\nDividing both sides by $\\left(\\frac{m}{7}\\right)^{n-2}a_1$, we get $\\left(\\frac{m}{7}\\right)^{n-2} < \\frac{m}{7}$.\nSimplifying, we have $\\left(\\frac{m}{7}\\right)^{n-2} < \\frac{m}{7} \\le 1$.\nSince $m$ is an integer, the only possible solution to this inequality is $m = \\boxed{1}$.\nThe answer is: 1",
        "For a geometric sequence with strictly decreasing terms, the common ratio $\\frac{m}{7}$ must be between 0 and 1, since each term is smaller than the previous term.\nThis means that $0 < \\frac{m}{7} < 1$.\nMultiplying all sides of this inequality by 7, we get $0 < m < 7$.\nSince $m$ must be an integer, there are $\\boxed{6}$ possible integer values for $m$.\nThe answer is: 6"
