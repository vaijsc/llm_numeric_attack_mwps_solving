        "The equation $x^2 - 12x + k = 0$ can be factored as $(x-a)(x-b) = 0$, where $a$ and $b$ are the roots of the equation.\nSince the roots are prime numbers, they must be distinct and positive.\nTherefore, we have $(x - a)(x - b) = (x - a)(x - a + b) = (x - a)(x + (a - b)) = x^2 - x(2a - b) + a^2 - b^2$.\nComparing this with the given equation, we have $-12x = -x(2a - b) - a(a - b)$, which simplifies to $-12x = -2ax + ab$.\nSince $a$ and $b$ are prime numbers and $a$ and $b$ are distinct, we know that $2a - b$ and $a - b$ are both positive.\nTherefore, $-2ax + ab$ must be negative, which means $12 < 2ax - ab$.\nSince $a$ and $b$ are prime numbers, the only possible positive integer values for $a$ and $b$ are 3 and 7 (excluding 2, which is not a prime number).\nSubstituting $a = 3$ and $b = 7$ into the equation, we have $-12x = -6x + 21$, which simplifies to $x = 3$.\nTherefore, the roots of the equation are 3 and 7, and the value of $k$ is $a^2 - b^2 = 3^2 - 7^2 = \\boxed{-40}$.\nThe answer is: -40",
        "Since the two prime numbers are positive and less than 12,\nthey must be 2 and 11 (since 2 and 11 are the only prime numbers less than 12).\nSo, the equation becomes $(x-2)(x-11)=0$.\nExpanding, we have $x^2-13x+22=0$.\nComparing this to the given equation $x^2-12x+k=0$, we see that $k=\\boxed{22}$.\nThe answer is: 22",
        "We have a quadratic equation of the form $x^2 - 12x + k = 0$.\nSince the coefficients of the quadratic are all integers, we know that the roots of the equation must be rational numbers.\nThe sum of the roots of the equation can be found by using Vieta's formulas, which states that for a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the sum of the roots is $-\\frac{b}{a}$.\nIn this case, the sum of the roots is $12$, so we can write the equation as $(x - p)(x - q) = x^2 - 12x + k = 0$, where $p$ and $q$ are the prime numbers that are the roots of the equation.\nExpanding the equation, we get $x^2 - (p + q)x + pq = 0$.\nComparing this with our original equation, we can see that $p + q = 12$ and $pq = k$.\nSince $p$ and $q$ are prime numbers, they must be positive integers.\nThe only pair of prime numbers that sum to $12$ is $(3, 9)$.\nTherefore, $p = 3$ and $q = 9$, so $k = pq = 39$.\nThe value of $k$ is $\\boxed{39}$.The answer is: 39",
        "The sum of the roots of the quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ is given by $-b/a$, and the product of the roots is given by $c/a$.\nIn this case, the sum of the roots is $12$, so the two prime numbers must be $6$ and $7$ (since they add up to $12$ and are prime).\nTherefore, the product of the roots is $k$, which is $6 \\cdot 7 = 42$.\nSo the value of $k$ is $\\boxed{42}$.\nThe answer is: 42",
        "Since the prime numbers are positive, we know that the sum of the two roots of the equation is $12$.\nBy Vieta\u2019s formulas, the sum of the roots of a quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ is $-b/a$.\nIn this case, the sum of the roots is $12$, so we have $-b/a = 12$.\nSince $a=1$ in our equation, we have $-b = 12$.\nSolving for $b$, we find $b = -12$.\nThe product of the roots of a quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ is $c/a$.\nIn this case, the product of the roots is $k$, so we have $c/a = k$.\nSince $a=1$ and $c=k$, we have $k = c$.\nFinally, we can find the value of $k$ by substituting $b = -12$ into the equation $x^2-12x+k=0$.\nWe have $(x-6)(x-k) = x^2 - (6+k)x + 6k$.\nComparing this to our original equation, we see that $6+k = 12$ and $6k = k$.\nSolving for $k$, we find $k = \\boxed{6}$.\nThe answer is: 6",
        "Let the two prime numbers be $p$ and $q$. We know that $p$ and $q$ are positive and distinct, so they must be greater than 1. The sum of the roots of a quadratic equation is given by $-\\frac{b}{a}$, where the quadratic equation is in the form $ax^2 + bx + c$. In this case, the sum of the roots is $p + q = 12$. Since $p$ and $q$ are prime numbers, the only way for their sum to be 12 is if one of them is 2 and the other is 10. However, if one of the roots is 2, then the quadratic equation must have a factor of $(x-2)$. Similarly, if one of the roots is 10, then the quadratic equation must have a factor of $(x-10)$. Therefore, the quadratic equation is $(x-2)(x-10)$. Expanding this equation, we get $x^2 - 12x + 20 = x^2 - 12x + k$. Comparing the constant terms, we see that $k = \\boxed{20}$.The answer is: 20",
        "The sum of the roots of the quadratic equation $x^2-12x+k=0$ is $12$.\nSince the roots are prime numbers, they must be $2$ and $11$ (or $11$ and $2$, which gives the same sum).\nUsing Vieta's formulas, the product of the roots is $k$.\nSo, $k=2\\times11=\\boxed{22}$.\nThe answer is: 22"
