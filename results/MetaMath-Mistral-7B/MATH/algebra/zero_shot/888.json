        "\nFirst, we need to find the vertical asymptotes of the function. The denominator of the fraction cannot be equal to zero. So we solve $x^2-5x-14=0$ to find the values of $x$ that make the denominator zero. This quadratic factors as $(x-2)(x+7)=0$. Therefore, the horizontal asymptote is $y=\\frac{2(2)}{(2)^2-5(2)-14}=\\frac{2}{-9}=-\\frac{1}{9}$.\nThe vertical asymptotes occur at $x=2$ and $x=-7$.\nTherefore, $a=2$, $b=-7$, and $c=-\\frac{1}{9}$. So, $a+b+c=2+(-7)+\\left(-\\frac{1}{9}\\right)=-\\frac{6}{9}-\\frac{1}{9}=\\frac{-7}{9}=\\boxed{-\\frac{7}{9}}$.The answer is: -\\frac{7}{9}",
