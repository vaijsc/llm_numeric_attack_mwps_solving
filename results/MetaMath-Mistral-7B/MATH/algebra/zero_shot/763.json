    "solution": "We can combine the two terms on the left side to get $\\dfrac{1+2x}{x-1} = 5$.  We then multiply both sides of this equation by $x-1$ to get rid of the fractions.   This gives us $1+2x = 5(x-1)$. Expanding the right side gives $1+2x = 5x -5$.  Subtracting $5x$ from both sides   gives $1-3x = -5$, and subtracting 1 from both sides of this equation yields $-3x = -6$.  Dividing both sides   of this equation by $-3$ gives us our answer, $x = \\boxed{2}$.",

        "Combining the fractions on the left side gives $\\frac{2x+1}{x-1}=5$.\nMultiplying both sides by $x-1$ gives $2x+1=5(x-1)$.\nExpanding the right side gives $2x+1=5x-5$.\nSubtracting $2x$ and adding $5$ to both sides gives $6=3x$.\nDividing both sides by $3$ gives $x=\\boxed{2}$.\nThe answer is: 2",
        "First, we simplify the left side of the equation: \\[\n\\frac{1}{x-1} + \\frac{2x}{x-1} = \\frac{1+2x}{x-1}.\n\\]To find the values of $x$ that satisfy the equation, we set the simplified left side equal to 5 and solve for $x$: \\[\n\\frac{1+2x}{x-1}=5.\n\\]Next, we cross-multiply and simplify: \\[\n1+2x = 5(x-1).\n\\]Expanding the right side gives \\[\n1+2x=5x-5,\n\\]and simplifying gives \\[\n3x=6.\n\\]Dividing both sides by 3 gives $x=2$, so the only solution is $x=\\boxed{2}$.The answer is: 2",
        "Combining the fractions on the left-hand side, we have $\\frac{2x+1}{x-1}=5$.\nMultiplying both sides by $x-1$, we get $2x+1=5x-5$.\nSimplifying, we have $3x=6$.\nDividing both sides by 3, we find $x=\\boxed{2}$.The answer is: 2"
