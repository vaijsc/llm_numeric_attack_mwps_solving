        "The revenue is given by the product of the price and the number of books sold per month:\n\\[ \\text{Revenue} = p(120-3p).\\]\nTo find the price that maximizes the revenue, we can take the derivative of the revenue function and set it equal to zero. The derivative of a quadratic function $ax^2+bx+c$ is $2ax+b$, so the derivative of $p(120-3p)$ is $120-6p$.\nSetting the derivative equal to zero gives us $120-6p=0$, which implies $p=20$.\nTo confirm that this is a maximum, we can look at the sign of the second derivative. The second derivative is $-6$, which is negative, so the revenue is indeed maximized at $p=\\boxed{20}$.\nThe answer is: 20",
