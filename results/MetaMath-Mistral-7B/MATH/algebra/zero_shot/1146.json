        "To determine how many total toy cars Aiden has received from Jo by the time he turns 12, we can follow these steps:\n1. **Identify the number of cars received each year:** \n   - On Aiden's 1st birthday, he received 1 car.\n   - On Aiden's 2nd birthday, he received 2 cars.\n   - On Aiden's 3rd birthday, he received 3 cars.\n   - ...\n   - On Aiden's 12th birthday, he received 12 cars.\n2. **Recognize the pattern:** \n   - The number of toy cars Aiden receives each year is equal to his age. Therefore, the total number of cars he receives can be represented as the sum of the first 12 positive integers.\n3. **Calculate the total number of cars using the formula for the sum of the first n integers:** \n   - The formula for the sum of the first n integers is: \n     \\[\n     S_n = \\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\n     \\]\n   - Here, n is 12, since we are calculating the sum up to Aiden's 12th birthday.\n4. **Plug in the value of n:**\n   \\[\n   S_{12} = \\frac{12(12 + 1)}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   S_{12} = \\frac{12 \\times 13}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   S_{12} = \\frac{156}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   S_{12} = 78\n   \\]\nSo, after receiving cars for his 12th birthday, Aiden will have received a total of **78 toy cars** from Jo.",

        "For Aiden's first birthday, he received 1 toy car.\nFor his second birthday, he received 2 toy cars.\nAnd so on, until his 12th birthday.\nWe can see that the total number of toy cars Aiden received is the sum of the numbers 1 through 12.\nTo find this sum, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:\nSum = (first term + last term) * (number of terms) / 2.\nThe first term is 1, the last term is 12, and the number of terms is 12.\nSo the sum is (1 + 12) * 12 / 2 = 13 * 6 = 78.\nTherefore, Aiden will have received a total of 78 toy cars from Jo. Answer: 78.The answer is: 78",
        "For each year, Aiden receives the number of cars equal to his age.\nSo for his 12th birthday, he will receive 12 cars.\nFor his 11th birthday, he received 11 cars.\nAnd so on up to his 1st birthday.\nTo find the total number of cars Aiden has received, we need to sum up the number of cars he received for each year.\nThis is a finite arithmetic series with a first term of 1, a common difference of 1, and 12 terms.\nThe formula for the sum of a finite arithmetic series is S = (n/2)(2a + (n-1)d), where n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and d is the common difference.\nPlugging in the values, we get S = (12/2)(2*1 + (12-1)*1) = (6)(2 + 11) = (6)(13) = 78.\nTherefore, Aiden will have received a total of 78 toy cars from Jo.\n#### 78\nThe answer is: 78",
        "Aiden received one car for his first birthday, two cars for his second birthday, and so on.\nSo, the number of cars he received on his 12th birthday is 12.\nTo find the total number of cars he received, we need to sum up the numbers from 1 to 12.\nUsing the formula for the sum of consecutive integers, we have 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 12 = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}, where n is the number of terms.\nPlugging in n = 12, we get \\frac{12(12+1)}{2} = \\frac{12(13)}{2} = 12 \\cdot 6 = 72.\nTherefore, Aiden will have received a total of \\boxed{72} toy cars from Jo.The answer is: 72",
        "\nThe number of cars Aiden received corresponds to his age, and he received a total of 12 cars.\nOn his first birthday, Aiden received 1 car.\nOn his second birthday, Aiden received 2 cars.\nOn his third birthday, Aiden received 3 cars.\nAnd so on...\nWe can see that the total number of cars Aiden received is the sum of the first 12 odd numbers.\nThe sum of the first 12 odd numbers can be found using the formula: $n^2$, where n is the number of terms.\nIn this case, n = 12, so $12^2 = 144$.\nTherefore, Aiden received a total of 144 toy cars from Jo.\nThe answer is: 144"
