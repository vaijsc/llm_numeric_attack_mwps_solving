    "solution": "Let the number of quarters in the first, second, third, and fourth piles be $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$, respectively. We have the equations \\begin{align*} \\tag{1}\na+b+c+d&=20\\\\ \\tag{2}\na&=b-3\\\\ \\tag{3}\nb&=c+2\\\\ \\tag{4}\nd&=2b\n\\end{align*} We want to find the value of $d$. We will express each of $a$, $b$, and $c$ in terms of $d$ and then substitute these equations into Equation (1) to find the value of $d$. From Equation (4), we have $b=d/2$. From Equation (3), we have $c=b-2$. Since $b=d/2$, we can rewrite Equation (3) as $c=d/2-2$. We can substitute $b=d/2$ into Equation (2) to get $a=d/2-3$. Substituting $b=d/2$, $c=d/2-2$, and $a=d/2-3$ into Equation (1) to eliminate $a$, $b$, and $c$, we get $(d/2-3)+d/2+(d/2-2)+d=20$, so $d=10$.
