        "Since Susan buys 4 tickets, the total cost for Susan without the coupon is $4 \\times \\$20 = \\$80$.\nWith the coupon, she gets a $25\\%$ discount on each ticket, so her total cost is $(1 - 0.25)(4 \\times \\$20) = 0.75(4 \\times \\$20) = \\$30$ less than the full price.\nTherefore, Susan pays $\\$80 - \\$30 = \\$50$ for the tickets.\nPam buys 5 tickets, so the total cost for Pam without the coupon is $5 \\times \\$20 = \\$100$.\nWith the coupon, she gets a $30\\%$ discount on each ticket, so her total cost is $(1 - 0.30)(5 \\times \\$20) = 0.70(5 \\times \\$20) = \\$35$ less than the full price.\nTherefore, Pam pays $\\$100 - \\$35 = \\$65$ for the tickets.\nThe difference in cost is $\\$65 - \\$50 = \\$15$.\nTherefore, Pam pays $\\$15$ more than Susan.\nThe answer is: 15",
        "Susan buys 4 tickets with a 25% discount, so she pays 75% of the original price.\nEach ticket costs $20, so Susan pays $0.75 \\times 20 \\times 4 = \\$72$.\nPam buys 5 tickets with a 30% discount, so she pays 70% of the original price.\nEach ticket costs $20, so Pam pays $0.70 \\times 20 \\times 5 = \\$70$.\nPam pays $72 - 70 = \\boxed{\\$2}$ more than Susan.\nThe answer is: 2",
        "Susan buys 4 tickets, so she saves $25\\%$ of $4 \\times \\$20 = $ \\$8.\nTherefore, Susan pays $4 \\times \\$20 - \\$8 = \\$64 - \\$8 = \\$56$ in total.\nPam buys 5 tickets, so she saves $30\\%$ of $5 \\times \\$20 = \\$10.\nTherefore, Pam pays $5 \\times \\$20 - \\$10 = \\$100 - \\$10 = \\$90$ in total.\nPam pays $\\$90 - \\$56 = \\$34$ more than Susan.\nThe answer is: 34",
