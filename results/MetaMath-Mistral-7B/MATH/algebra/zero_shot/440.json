        "We know that 8 fish can exist per cubic meter of water.\nIf we want to study 600 fish, we need to determine how many cubic meters of water are required.\nTo do this, we divide the number of fish by the number of fish per cubic meter: 600 fish / 8 fish per cubic meter = 75 cubic meters of water.\nTherefore, the minimum number of cubic meters of water necessary to maintain a healthy study environment is 75 cubic meters.\n#### 75\nThe answer is: 75",
        "We are given that 8 fish can exist per cubic meter of water without the symptoms of overcrowding.\nTo find the minimum number of cubic meters of water necessary to maintain a healthy study environment for 600 fish, we can divide the total number of fish by the number of fish per cubic meter.\n600 fish / 8 fish per cubic meter = 75 cubic meters of water.\nTherefore, the minimum number of cubic meters of water necessary is 75.\n#### 75\nThe answer is: 75",
        "To calculate the minimum number of cubic meters of water necessary, we need to divide the total number of fish by the number of fish per cubic meter.\nThe total number of fish is 600.\nThe number of fish per cubic meter is 8.\nSo, the minimum number of cubic meters of water necessary is 600/8 = 75.\nTherefore, the minimum number of cubic meters of water necessary is 75.\n#### 75\nThe answer is: 75"
