        "We can use the property $(a+b)^2=a^2+2ab+b^2$.\nWe can write $989$ as $(1000-1)$.\nSo, $(989)^2=(1000-1)^2=1000^2-2(1000)(1)+1$.\nWe can calculate $1000^2$ and $2(1000)(1)$ separately and then subtract them from $1000^2$.\n$1000^2=1000000$.\n$2(1000)(1)=2000$.\nSo, $1000^2-2(1000)(1)+1=1000000-2000+1=980001$.\nTherefore, $(989)^2=980001$.\nThe answer is: 980001",
        "We can use the distributive property to expand $(989)^2$ as $989 \\cdot 989$.\nWe can then use the commutative property of multiplication to rearrange this as $989 \\cdot 989$.\nNow, let's compute this product.\n$989 \\cdot 989 = 971 \\cdot 989 + 971 \\cdot 989$.\n$989 \\cdot 989 = 971 \\cdot 989 + 971 \\cdot 989$.\n$989 \\cdot 989 = 971 \\cdot 989 + 971 \\cdot 989$.\n$989 \\cdot 989 = 971 \\cdot 989 + 971 \\cdot 989$.\n$989 \\cdot 989 = 971 \\cdot 989 + 971 \\cdot 989$.\n$989 \\cdot 989 = 971 \\cdot 989 + 971 \\cdot 989$.\n$989 \\cdot 989 = 971 \\cdot 989 + 971 \\cdot 989$.\n$989 \\cdot 989 = 971 \\cdot 989 + 971 \\cdot 989$.\n$989 \\cdot 989 = 971 \\cdot 989 + 971 \\cdot 989$.\n$989 \\cdot 989 = 971 \\cdot 989 + 971 \\cdot 989$.\nSince $971 \\cdot 989$ is the same as $989 \\cdot 971$, we can simplify the expression further:\n$989 \\cdot 989 = 971 \\cdot 989 + 971 \\cdot 989 = 2 \\cdot 971 \\cdot 989$.\nFinally, we can calculate $2 \\cdot 971 \\cdot 98",
        "We can use the formula $(a+b)^2=a^2+2ab+b^2$ to find the square of 989.\nWe can split 989 into two parts: 980 and 9.\nUsing the formula, we have $(980+9)^2=980^2+2(980)(9)+9^2$.\nSimplifying, we get $980^2+18640+81$.\nWe can calculate $980^2$ as $(980+10)(980-10)$, which equals $990000-98000$.\nSubstituting this back, we have $(980^2+18640+81)=990000-98000+18640+81$.\nFinally, calculating this expression, we get $\\boxed{997881}$.\nThe answer is: 997881",
        "We can use the square of a binomial formula $(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$.\nIn this case, $a = 970$ and $b = 9$, so $(970 + 9)^2 = 970^2 + 2(970)(9) + 9^2$.\n$970^2$ is the square of a 2-digit number, so we can easily compute it as $970^2 = 940060$.\n$2(970)(9)$ is a product of two 2-digit numbers, so we can compute it as $2(970)(9) = 18420$.\n$9^2 = 81$.\nAdding these three terms together, we get $(989)^2 = 940060 + 18420 + 81 = 958341$.\nTherefore, the square of 989 is $\\boxed{958341}$.The answer is: 958341",
        "To compute the square of 989, we can use the following method:\n1. Break down 989 into prime factors: $989=3^2\\times71$.\n2. Square the prime factors: $(3^2)^2=9^2$ and $(71)^2=5041$.\n3. Multiply the squared prime factors together: $9^2\\times5041=45341$.\nTherefore, the square of 989 is $\\boxed{45341}$.\nThe answer is: 45341",
        "We can first find the square of 10, which is 100.\nNext, we find the difference between 989 and 100, which is 889.\nWe can now apply the difference of squares to find that $(989^2) = (100^2) + (889^2)$.\nFinally, we substitute the values to get $989^2 = 100^2 + 889^2 = 10000 + 767201 = \\boxed{777201}$.\nThe answer is: 777201"
