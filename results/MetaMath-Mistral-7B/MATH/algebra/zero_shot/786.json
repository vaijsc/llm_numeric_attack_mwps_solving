        "To determine how many degrees the Earth rotates in one hour, we start with the information that the Earth completes one full rotation of 360 degrees in 24 hours (which is the length of one day).\n1. **Total degrees in one full rotation**: 360 degrees\n2. **Total hours in one day**: 24 hours\nNext, to find out how many degrees the Earth rotates in one hour, we can divide the total degrees by the total hours:\n\\[\n\\text{Degrees per hour} = \\frac{360 \\text{ degrees}}{24 \\text{ hours}} \n\\]\nNow, we perform the division:\n\\[\n\\text{Degrees per hour} = 15 \\text{ degrees per hour}\n\\]\nThus, the Earth rotates **15 degrees in one hour**.",
