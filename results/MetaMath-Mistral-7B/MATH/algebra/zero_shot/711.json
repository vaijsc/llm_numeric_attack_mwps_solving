We can set up a system of two equations to represent the given information, as follows:\n\n\\begin{align*}\ng &= 8a \\\\\ng-a &= 56 \\\\\n\\end{align*}In particular, the second equation represents the grandfather's age $a$ years ago, when Andrew was born. To solve for $a$, we need to eliminate $g$ from the equations above. Substituting the first equation into the second to eliminate $g$, we get that $8a-a=56$ or $a=8$. Thus, Andrew is $\\boxed{8}$ years old now.",

        "Let's denote Andrew's current age as \\( A \\) and his grandfather's current age as \\( G \\).\nFrom the problem, we have two key pieces of information:\n1. Andrew's grandfather's age is eight times Andrew's age:\n   \\[\n   G = 8A\n   \\]\n2. Andrew's grandfather was 56 years old when Andrew was born. This means the age difference between Andrew and his grandfather is 56 years. Thus, we can express the grandfather's age in terms of Andrew's age:\n   \\[\n   G = A + 56\n   \\]\nNow we have two equations:\n1. \\( G = 8A \\)\n2. \\( G = A + 56 \\)\nSince both expressions equal \\( G \\), we can set them equal to each other:\n\\[\n8A = A + 56\n\\]\nNext, we solve for \\( A \\). First, subtract \\( A \\) from both sides:\n\\[\n8A - A = 56\n\\]\n\\[\n7A = 56\n\\]\nNow, divide both sides by 7:\n\\[\nA = \\frac{56}{7} = 8\n\\]\nThus, Andrew is currently \\( \\mathbf{8} \\) years old.\nTo find Andrew's grandfather's age, we can substitute \\( A \\) back into one of the equations:\n\\[\nG = 8A = 8 \\times 8 = 64\n\\]\nSo, Andrew's grandfather is \\( 64 \\) years old.\nTo summarize:\n- Andrew's current age \\( A = 8 \\) years.\n- His grandfather's current age is \\( 64 \\) years.\nThus, the answer is that Andrew is \\( \\boxed{8} \\) years old.",

        "Let's denote Andrew's current age as \\( x \\). \nAccording to the problem, Andrew's grandfather's age is eight times Andrew's age, so we can express his grandfather's age as:\n\\[\n8x\n\\]\nThe problem also states that Andrew's grandfather was 56 years old when Andrew was born. This means that the age difference between Andrew and his grandfather is 56 years. Hence, we can represent this relationship as:\n\\[\n\\text{Grandfather's age} - \\text{Andrew's age} = 56\n\\]\nSubstituting the expression for Andrew's grandfather's age, we have:\n\\[\n8x - x = 56\n\\]\nSimplifying this gives:\n\\[\n7x = 56\n\\]\nNow we can solve for \\( x \\):\n\\[\nx = \\frac{56}{7} = 8\n\\]\nTherefore, Andrew is currently **8 years old**.\nTo verify:\n- If Andrew is 8 years old, his grandfather's age would be \\( 8 \\times 8 = 64 \\) years.\n- The age difference would be \\( 64 - 8 = 56 \\), which matches the condition given in the problem.\nThus, Andrew is indeed **8 years old**.",

The age difference is \\( 64 - 8 = 56 \\), which is consistent with the information given.\nTherefore, Andrew's current age is \\( \\boxed{8} \\).",
        "To solve the problem, we can start by setting up the variables for Andrew's age and his grandfather's age.\n1. Let Andrew's current age be \\( A \\).\n2. Since Andrew's grandfather\u2019s age is eight times Andrew's age, we can express his grandfather's age as \\( 8A \\).\nNext, we know from the problem that Andrew's grandfather was 56 years old when Andrew was born. This means that the age difference between Andrew and his grandfather is always 56 years. We can express this relationship mathematically:\n\\[\n\\text{Grandfather's age when Andrew was born} = \\text{Grandfather's current age} - \\text{Andrew's current age}\n\\]\nSince Andrew's grandfather was 56 years old when Andrew was born, we can write:\n\\[\n8A - A = 56\n\\]\nNow, simplify the left side of the equation:\n\\[\n7A = 56\n\\]\nTo find Andrew's age, we can divide both sides by 7:\n\\[\nA = \\frac{56}{7} = 8\n\\]\nThus, Andrew is currently **8 years old**.\nTo verify this, we can calculate Andrew's grandfather's age. If Andrew is 8 years old, then his grandfather's age is:\n\\[\n8A = 8 \\times 8 = 64\n\\]\nNow, we check the age difference:\n\\[\n64 - 8 = 56\n\\]\nIndeed, the age difference is 56 years, which matches the information given. Therefore, Andrew's current age is correct.\nThe final answer is:\n**Andrew is 8 years old.**"
