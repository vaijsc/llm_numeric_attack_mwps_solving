        "The general form of a parabola with vertex $(h,k)$ is $y=a(x-h)^2+k$.\nSo, we can rewrite the given equation as $y=-2(x+6)^2-15$.\nComparing this with the general form, we see that the vertex is $(-6,-15)$.\nTherefore, $m=-6$ and $n=-15$, so $m+n=-6+(-15)=\\boxed{-21}$.\nThe answer is: -21",
        "The equation $y=-2x^2-12x-15$ is in the form $y=ax^2+bx+c$,\nwhere $a=-2$, $b=-12$, and $c=-15$.\nThe vertex of a parabola in this form is given by the point $(h, k)$, where $h=-\\frac{b}{2a}$ and $k=c$.\nSo in this case, $h=-\\frac{-12}{2(-2)}=3$, and $k=-15$.\nTherefore, the vertex is $(3, -15)$, and $m+n=3+(-15)=\\boxed{-12}$.\nThe answer is: -12",
        "To find the vertex of the parabola, we can rewrite the equation in the form $y=a(x-h)^2+k$, where $(h,k)$ is the vertex.\nWe complete the square for the $x$ terms: \\[\ny=-2(x^2+6x)-15 = -2(x^2+6x+9)-15+9=-2(x+3)^2-6.\n\\] Comparing this with $y=a(x-h)^2+k$, we see that $h=-3$ and $k=-6$.\nTherefore, the vertex is $(-3,-6)$, and $m+n=(-3)+(-6)=\\boxed{-9}$.\nThe answer is: -9",
        "The vertex of a parabola can be found using the formula $x = -\\frac{b}{2a}$, where $a$ and $b$ are the coefficients of the $x^2$ and $x$ terms, respectively.\nIn this case, $a = -2$ and $b = -12$, so\n$x = -\\frac{-12}{2(-2)} = 3$.\nTo find the $y$-coordinate of the vertex, we substitute $x = 3$ into the equation:\n$y = -2(3^2) - 12(3) - 15 = -2(9) - 36 - 15 = -18 - 36 - 15 = -69$.\nTherefore, the vertex is $(3, -69)$, and $m + n = 3 + (-69) = \\boxed{-66}$.\nThe answer is: -66",
        "The vertex of a parabola in the form $y=ax^2+bx+c$ is given by the coordinates $\\left(-\\frac{b}{2a}, f\\left(-\\frac{b}{2a}\\right)\\right)$.\nIn this case, $a=-2$, $b=-12$, and $c=-15$.\nWe can use the formula to find the x-coordinate of the vertex:\n\\[x=-\\frac{b}{2a}=-\\frac{-12}{2(-2)}=-\\frac{-12}{-4}=3.\\]\nSubstituting this x-coordinate into the equation, we can find the y-coordinate of the vertex:\n\\[y=-2(3)^2-12(3)-15=-2(9)-36-15=-18-36-15=-69.\\]\nTherefore, the vertex is $(3,-69)$, and $m+n=3+(-69)=\\boxed{-66}$.\nThe answer is: -66",
        "We know that the equation of a parabola in the form $y=a(x-h)^2+k$ has the vertex at $(h,k)$.\nTo find the vertex of the given parabola, we need to complete the square.\nWe can rewrite the equation as $y=-a(x^2+12x)+k$, where $a=-2$.\nTo complete the square, we add and subtract $(12/2)^2=36$ inside the parentheses:\n$$y=-a(x^2+12x+36-36)+k=-a(x^2+12x+36)+ak-36a.$$\nNow, we can group the quadratic terms and the constant term:\n$$y=-a((x^2+12x+36)-36)+ak-36a=-a(x+6)^2+ak-36a.$$\nComparing this with the standard form of a parabola, we can see that the vertex is at $(-6,ak-36a)$.\nTo find the value of $m+n$, we substitute $a=-2$ into the equation:\n$$m+n=-6+(-2)(-36a)-36(-2).$$\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n$$m+n=-6+72a+72=72a+66.$$\nSince we can't determine the value of $a$ without further information, we can't find the exact value of $m+n$.\nHowever, we can conclude that $m+n$ is equal to $\\boxed{66}$.\nThe answer is: 66",
        "The vertex of a parabola defined by the equation $y=ax^2+bx+c$ is given by the coordinates $(h, k)$,\nwhere $h$ is the x-coordinate of the vertex and $k$ is the y-coordinate of the vertex.\nTo find the x-coordinate of the vertex, we can use the formula $h = -\\frac{b}{2a}$.\nIn this case, $a=-2$ and $b=-12$, so we have $h = -\\frac{-12}{2(-2)} = 3$.\nTo find the y-coordinate of the vertex, we can substitute $h$ into the equation $y = ax^2 + bx + c$.\nIn this case, $a=-2$, $b=-12$, and $c=-15$, so we have $n = -2(3)^2 - 12(3) - 15 = -2(9) - 36 - 15 = -18 - 36 - 15 = -69$.\nFinally, we can find $m+n$ by adding $m$ and $n$, which gives us $3 + (-69) = -66$.\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{-66}$.The answer is: -66"
