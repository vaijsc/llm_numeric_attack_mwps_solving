        "To determine the least number of widgets the company must sell to make a profit, we need to analyze the costs and revenues associated with selling these widgets.\n1. **Fixed Costs**: The company has a one-time equipment fee of \\$1000. This cost does not change regardless of how many widgets are produced.\n2. **Variable Costs**: It costs \\$0.50 to produce each widget. If the company produces \\( x \\) widgets, the total variable cost would be:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Variable Cost} = 0.50x\n   \\]\n3. **Total Costs**: The total cost incurred by the company, which includes both fixed and variable costs, can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Cost} = \\text{Fixed Cost} + \\text{Variable Cost} = 1000 + 0.50x\n   \\]\n4. **Revenue**: The company sells each widget for \\$2.75. Therefore, if \\( x \\) widgets are sold, the total revenue would be:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Revenue} = 2.75x\n   \\]\n5. **Profit Condition**: To find the break-even point where the company begins to make a profit, we need to set the total revenue equal to the total costs and solve for \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Revenue} = \\text{Total Cost}\n   \\]\n   This gives us the equation:\n   \\[\n   2.75x = 1000 + 0.50x\n   \\]\n6. **Solve for \\( x \\)**:\n   - First, isolate \\( x \\) by moving all terms involving \\( x \\) to one side of the equation:\n   \\[\n   2.75x - 0.50x = 1000\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   2.25x = 1000\n   \\]\n   - Next, divide both sides by 2.25 to solve for \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{1000}{2.25}\n   \\]\n7. **Calculate \\( x \\)**:\n   - Perform the division:\n   \\[\n   x \\approx 444.44\n   \\]\nSince the company cannot sell a fraction of a widget, we round up to the nearest whole number.
