        "To find the values of \\( x \\) for which the function \\( y = \\frac{x-2}{x^2 - 7x + 10} \\) is not defined, we need to determine when the denominator \\( x^2 - 7x + 10 \\) is equal to zero, since division by zero is undefined.\nLet's start by solving the equation:\n\\[\nx^2 - 7x + 10 = 0\n\\]\nWe can factor the quadratic expression. We are looking for two numbers that multiply to \\( 10 \\) (the constant term) and add up to \\( -7 \\) (the coefficient of \\( x \\)). These numbers are \\( -2 \\) and \\( -5 \\), so we can write:\n\\[\nx^2 - 7x + 10 = (x - 2)(x - 5)\n\\]\nSetting the factored expression equal to zero gives us:\n\\[\n(x - 2)(x - 5) = 0\n\\]\nThis equation holds true when either factor is zero:\n1. \\( x - 2 = 0 \\)  implies \\( x = 2 \\)\n2. \\( x - 5 = 0 \\)  implies \\( x = 5 \\)\nThus, the values of \\( x \\) that make the function \\( y \\) not defined are \\( x = 2 \\) and \\( x = 5 \\).\nTo count the number of values of \\( x \\) for which the function is not defined, we observe that there are two such values:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]",
