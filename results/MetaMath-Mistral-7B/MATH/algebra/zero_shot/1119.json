    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The sixth term is exactly halfway between the fourth and the eighth in the arithmetic sequence, so it is the average of the two terms. Therefore, the sixth term is $(200 + 500)/2 = \\boxed{350}$.  We also could have found the common difference by noting that there are four steps between the fourth term and the eighth term.  So, if $d$ is the common difference, we have $4d = 500-200 = 300$. Therefore, we find $d=75$.  The sixth term is two steps after the fourth, or $200 + 2d = \\boxed{350}$.",
