    "solution": "Because the question only asks for the value of $m$, we can begin by eliminating $n$. In order to do this, we multiply the second equation by 4, giving us a system of two equations where both coefficients of $n$ are 4: \\begin{align*} 3m+4n=47\n\\\\ 4m+4n=60\n\\end{align*}From here, we can just subtract the second equation from the first. This gives us $(3m+4n)-(4m+4n)=47-60$, which simplifies to $-m=-13$ or $m=\\boxed{13}$.",

        "We can solve this system of equations by solving for $m$ in terms of $n$ and then substituting the value of $n$ into one of the original equations to solve for $m$.\nFrom the second equation, we have $m = 15 - n$.\nSubstituting this into the first equation, we get $3(15-n) + 4n = 47$.\nSimplifying and rearranging, we have $45 - 3n + 4n = 47$.\nCombining like terms, we have $n = 2$.\nSubstituting this value into the second equation, we have $m = 15 - 2 = \\boxed{13}$.\nThe answer is: 13",
        "\nWe have the system of equations:\n\\begin{align*}\n3m+4n&=47, \\\\\nm+n&=15.\n\\end{align*}\nTo eliminate a variable, we can multiply the second equation by 3 and subtract it from the first equation:\n\\begin{align*}\n3m+4n-3(m+n)&=47-3(15) \\\\\n3m+4n-3m-3n&=47-45 \\\\\nm+n&=2.\n\\end{align*}\nBut we already know that $m+n=15$, so we have a contradiction.\nTherefore, there is no solution to this system of equations, and the question is undefined.The answer is: 15",
        "We have the following system of equations:\\[\n\\begin{array}{rcrcr}\n3m &+ &4n & = & 47 \\\\\nm &+ &n & = & 15\n\\end{array}\n\\]We can solve this system by eliminating one of the variables.\nMultiplying the second equation by 4, we have $4m + 4n = 60$.\nSubtracting the first equation from this, we have $(4m + 4n) - (3m + 4n) = 60 - 47$,\nwhich simplifies to $m = \\boxed{13}$.\nThe answer is: 13"
