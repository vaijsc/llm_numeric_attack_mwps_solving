        "If $125^b=5$, then $5^3=5$, so $b=3$.\nIf $27^b=c$, then $3^3=c$, so $c=\\boxed{27}$.\nThe answer is: 27",
        "First, we can rewrite $125$ as $5^3$ and $27$ as $3^3$.\nSo we have $(5^3)^b=5$ and $(3^3)^b=c$.\nUsing the property of exponents $(a^m)^n=a^{mn}$, we can simplify these equations to $5^{3b}=5$ and $3^{3b}=c$.\nSince $5^{3b}=5$, we can conclude that $3b=1$ which implies $b=\\frac{1}{3}$.\nSubstituting this value of $b$ into $3^{3b}=c$, we get $3^{\\frac{1}{3}}=c$.\nSince $3^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ is equal to the cube root of $3$, the value of $c$ is $\\boxed{3}$.\nThe answer is: 3",
