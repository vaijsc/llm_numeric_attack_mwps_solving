        "We can write 123123 as $\\frac{123123}{1001} = \\frac{123 \\cdot 1000 + 123}{1001} = \\frac{123 \\cdot 1000}{1001} + \\frac{123}{1001} = 122 + \\frac{123}{1001}$.\nSince $\\frac{123}{1001}$ is a fraction less than 1, it does not affect the thousands digit of the quotient.\nTherefore, the value of $\\frac{123123}{1001}$ is $\\boxed{122}$.\nThe answer is: 122",
        "To divide a number by another number, we can use long division.\nThe first step is to count how many digits are in the divisor, which is 1001.\nSince the divisor has three digits, we will create three groups of three digits in the dividend (123123).\nWe start by dividing 123123 by 1001.\nThe remainder is 12, so we bring down the next group of three digits, which is 123.\nWe then bring down the last group of three digits, which is 120.\nNext, we divide 12312 by 1001.\nThe remainder is 792, so we bring down the last group of three digits, which is 120.\nFinally, we divide 792120 by 1001.\nThe remainder is 119, which means that 123123 divided by 1001 is 123 with a remainder of 119.\nTherefore, the value of 123123 divided by 1001 is $\\boxed{123 \\frac{119}{1001}}$.The answer is: 123\\frac{119}{1001}",
        "\nWe can divide 123123 by 1001 as follows:\n\\[123123\\div1001 = (123123\\div1000) \\times (1\\div1001).\\]\nNote that $123123\\div1000$ is equal to 123.123, which is the same as 123 with three decimal places.\nSo, we have:\n\\[123123\\div1001 = 123.123\\times (1\\div1001).\\]\nSimplifying the decimal multiplication, we get:\n\\[123123\\div1001 = 123.123\\times 0.001.\\]\nMultiplying, we find that:\n\\[123123\\div1001 = 0.123123.\\]\nTherefore, the value of 123123 divided by 1001 is $\\boxed{0.123123}$.The answer is: 0.123123",
        "We can divide 123123 by 1001 using long division.\nThe first step is to divide 123 by 1001.\nThe quotient is 0 and the remainder is 123.\nThe next step is to divide 1230 by 1001.\nThe quotient is 1 and the remainder is 230.\nThe next step is to divide 230 by 1001.\nThe quotient is 0 and the remainder is 230.\nThe next step is to divide 230 by 1001.\nThe quotient is 0 and the remainder is 230.\nThe next step is to divide 230 by 1001.\nThe quotient is 0 and the remainder is 230.\nThe next step is to divide 230 by 1001.\nThe quotient is 0 and the remainder is 230.\nFinally, the next step is to divide 230 by 1001.\nThe quotient is 0 and the remainder is 230.\nSince the remainder is the same as the original number, we can stop here and conclude that 123123 divided by 1001 is equal to 0 with a remainder of 123.\nTherefore, the value of 123123 divided by 1001 is $\\boxed{0\\text{ remainder }123}$.The answer is: 0\\text{ remainder }123",
        "We can rewrite 123123 as $\\frac{123\\times1001}{1001}$.\nWe can cancel out the common factor of 1001 in the numerator and denominator to get $\\frac{123}{1}$.\nTherefore, 123123 divided by 1001 is equal to $\\boxed{123}$.The answer is: 123",
        "We can write 123123 as $(1000 + 3)(100 + 1)$. \nThis is equal to $1000 \\times 100 + 100 \\times 3 + 3 \\times 1$. \nSimplifying, we get $100000 + 300 + 3 = 100303$. \nNow, we divide 100303 by 1001: \n$\\frac{100303}{1001} = \\frac{1001 \\times 1002}{1001} = 1002$. \nTherefore, the value of 123123 divided by 1001 is $\\boxed{1002}$.The answer is: 1002"
