        "The degree of a polynomial is determined by the highest power of the variable that appears.\nSince $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 4, it has a term of the form $ax^4$, where $a$ is a constant.\nSince $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 2, it has a term of the form $bx^2$, where $b$ is a constant.\nWhen we subtract $g(x)$ from $f(x)$, the highest power of $x$ that appears is $x^4$, so the degree of $f(x) - g(x)$ is $\\boxed{4}$.The answer is: 4",
        " since $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 4 and $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 2.\nWhen we subtract two polynomials, we subtract their corresponding coefficients.\nSince the highest degree term in $f(x)$ is $x^4$ and the highest degree term in $g(x)$ is $x^2$,\nthe highest degree term in $f(x) - g(x)$ is the difference between these two terms, which is $x^4 - x^2$.\nThe degree of $f(x) - g(x)$ is the degree of this highest degree term, which is $\\boxed{4}$.\nThe answer is: 4",
        "Since $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 4, its highest power term is $x^4$.\nSimilarly, since $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 2, its highest power term is $x^2$.\nWhen we subtract $g(x)$ from $f(x)$, the highest power term will be the difference between the highest power terms of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$.\nTherefore, the highest power term of $f(x) - g(x)$ is $x^4 - x^2 = x^2(x^2 - 1)$.\nSince the highest power term is now a quadratic in $x$, the degree of the polynomial is $\\boxed{6}$.\nThe answer is: 6"
