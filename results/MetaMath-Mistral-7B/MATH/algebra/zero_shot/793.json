We can express this problem as an exponential equation, as follows: $$2^{x+6} = 2\\cdot 4^{x+1}.$$Now, since $4 = 2^2$, we have $2\\cdot 4^{x+1} = 2\\cdot (2^2)^{x+1} = 2\\cdot 2^{2x+2} = 2^{2x + 3}$, which means our equation is: $$2^{x + 6} = 2^{2x + 3}.$$Then, we set the exponents equal to each other, and obtain $$x + 6 = 2x + 3.$$Solving for $x$, we get $\\boxed{x = 3}$.",

So after x hours, the population of Rod will be 2 * 2^x = 2^{x+1}.\nWhen Sphere starts growing, it quadruples every hour. So after x hours, the population of Sphere will be 8 * 2^x = 2^(x+3).\nSince Rod and Sphere have the same population after x hours, we can set up the equation: 2^(x+1) = 2^(x+3).\nSince the bases are the same, we can equate the exponents: x+1 = x+3.\nSubtracting x from both sides, we get 1 = 3.\nSince this is not true, there is no value of x that satisfies the equation.\nTherefore, there is no time at which Rod and Sphere have the same population.\nThere must be an error in the problem or the question is not possible to solve.\nPlease check the problem again or provide more information.\nThe answer is: 3",

So, at 8 p.m., Rod had a population of 2^h.\nWhen Jane started growing Sphere, Sphere had a population of 8.\nSince Sphere quadruples every hour, 8 quadrupled h times is 8*4^h. So, at 8 p.m., Sphere had a population of 8*4^h.\nSince Rod and Sphere have the same population at 8 p.m., we can set up the equation 2^h = 8*4^h.\nDividing both sides by 2^h, we get 1 = 4^h.\nSince 4 = 2^2, we can rewrite the equation as 1 = 2^{2h}.\nTaking the logarithm of both sides, we get log(1) = 2h*log(2).\nSimplifying the left side gives 0 = 2h*log(2).\nDividing both sides by 2*log(2), we get h = 0 / (2*log(2)).\nSince h cannot be divided by zero, there is no unique solution for h.\nHowever, we can say that h must be divisible by 2*log(2).\nSince log(2) is approximately 0.301, 2*log(2) is approximately 0.602.\nThe smallest positive integer that is divisible by 0.602 is 6.\nTherefore, h must be divisible by 6.\nThe only possible values for h are 6, 12, 18, etc.\nSince Jane started growing Sphere 5 hours before growing Rod, h = 6.\nSo, 6 hours ago, Jane started growing Sphere.\n#### 6#### 6\nThe answer is: 6",
