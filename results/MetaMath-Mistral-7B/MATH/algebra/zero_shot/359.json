        "The sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms.\nIn this case, the first term is $-30$, the last term is $26$, and the number of terms is $26 - (-30) + 1 = 57$.\nSo, the sum of all integers $x$ for which $-30 \\leq x \\leq 26$ is $\\frac{(-30 + 26)}{2} \\cdot 57 = \\boxed{435}$.The answer is: 435",
        "The sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms.\nIn this case, the first term is $-30$, the last term is $26$, and the common difference is $1$.\nUsing the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, we can calculate:\nSum = (first term + last term) * (number of terms) / 2\nSum = (-30 + 26) * (26 - (-30) + 1) / 2\nSum = (-4) * (57) / 2\nSum = -228 / 2\nSum = -114\nSo, the sum of all integers $x$ in the given range is $\\boxed{-114}$.The answer is: -114",
        "We want to find the sum of all integers $x$ in the range $-30 \\leq x \\leq 26$.\nWe can break this range into smaller ranges and find the sum of integers in each range separately.\nFor the range $-30 \\leq x \\leq -29$, there is only one integer, which is $-30$.\nFor the range $-29 \\leq x \\leq -28$, there is only one integer, which is $-29$.\nAnd so on, until the range $25 \\leq x \\leq 26$, where there is only one integer, which is $26$.\nIn total, there are $26 - (-30) + 1 = 57$ integers in this range.\nSince the sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, the sum of all these integers is $\\frac{-30 + 26}{2} \\cdot 57 = \\frac{4}{2} \\cdot 57 = 2 \\cdot 57 = \\boxed{114}$.\nThe answer is: 114",
        "The given inequality $-30 \\leq x \\leq 26$ represents the numbers between $-30$ and $26$ (inclusive).\nWe can find the sum of these integers by finding the sum of the odd integers from $-30$ to $26$.\nThe sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, so the sum of the odd integers from $-30$ to $26$ is \\[\\frac{(-30 + 26)}{2} \\cdot (26 - (-30) + 1) = \\frac{4}{2} \\cdot 57 = \\boxed{114}.\\]\nThe answer is: 114",
        "The sum of all integers from -30 to 26 can be found by adding the sum of the first and last terms, and multiplying by the number of terms.\nThe first term is -30, the last term is 26, and the number of terms is 26 - (-30) + 1 = 57.\nSo, the sum of all integers is $\\frac{(26+(-30)) \\cdot 57}{2} = \\boxed{-13}.$\nThe answer is: -13"
