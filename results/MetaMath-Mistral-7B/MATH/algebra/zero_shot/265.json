Let's use elimination.\nMultiply the first equation by 2 to get:\n\\[2(A+B)=10\\]\n\\[2A+2B=10\\]\nNow subtract this equation from the second equation to cancel the $A$ term:\n\\[5A+2B-(2A+2B)=-16-10\\]\n\\[3A=-26\\]\n\\[A=-8.\\]\nSubstituting this back into the first equation, we have:\n\\[2(-8)+2B=10\\]\n\\[-16+2B=10\\]\n\\[2B=26\\]\n\\[B=13.\\]\nSo $A+B=(-8)+13=\\boxed{5}$.\nThe answer is: 5",
