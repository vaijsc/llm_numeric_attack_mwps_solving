        "xels $a,$ $d,$ and $n.$\nAccording to the given information, $a = (n-1)d.$\nWe are also given that $a = (n-2)d + 8.$\nSetting these two expressions for $a$ equal to each other, we have $(n-1)d = (n-2)d + 8.$\nSimplifying, we find $-d = 8,$ so $d = -8.$\nSubstituting this value of $d$ into either expression for $a,$ we find $a = (n-1)(-8) + 8 = -8n + 8.$\nWe are given that the fourth term is $8,$ so $-8n + 8 = 8.$\nSolving, we find $n = 1.$\nTherefore, the first term is $a = (n-1)(d) = (1-1)(-8) = \\boxed{0}.$The answer is: 0",
        "Let the common difference be $d$, and let the first term be $a$.\nThen the third term is $a + 2d$ and the second term is $a + d$.\nGiven that the first term equals the third minus the second, we have the equation $a = (a + 2d) - (a + d)$.\nSimplifying the equation, we get $a = a + 2d - a - d$, or $2d = d$, which implies $d = 0$.\nSince the common difference is 0, the arithmetic sequence is actually just a singleton with only one term.\nTherefore, the first term is simply the fourth term, which is $\\boxed{8}$.\nThe answer is: 8",
        "Let $a$ be the first term and $d$ be the common difference of the arithmetic sequence.\nWe are given that $a = a_3 - a_2$ and $a_4 = 8$.\nFrom $a = a_3 - a_2$, we have $a = a + 2d - a = 2d$.\nSo $2d = a$.\nFrom $a_4 = 8$, we have $a + 3d = 8$.\nSubstituting $2d = a$, we get $2d + 3d = 8$.\nCombining like terms, we get $5d = 8$.\nDividing both sides by 5, we get $d = \\frac{8}{5}$.\nSubstituting $2d = a$, we get $a = 2d = 2\\left(\\frac{8}{5}\\right) = \\boxed{\\frac{16}{5}}$.\nThe answer is: \\frac{16}{5}",
