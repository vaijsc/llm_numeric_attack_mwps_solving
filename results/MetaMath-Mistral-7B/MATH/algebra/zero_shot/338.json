        "Let's say Josh and Mike ride at rates of $x$ and $y$ miles per hour, respectively.\nSince Josh rides for twice the length of time as Mike, we can set up the equation $\\frac{2}{1} = \\frac{x}{y}$.\nSimplifying, we get $2y = x$.\nSince Josh rides at four-fifths of Mike's rate, we have $x = \\frac{4}{5}y$.\nSubstituting $\\frac{4}{5}y$ for $x$ in the equation $2y = x$, we get $2y = \\frac{4}{5}y$.\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by $\\frac{5}{2}$, we get $5y = 4y$.\nSimplifying, we get $y = 0$.\nSince it doesn't make sense for Mike's rate to be 0 miles per hour, there must be an error somewhere in the given information.\nTherefore, we cannot determine how many miles Mike had ridden when they met.The answer is: 0",
        "Let's say that Mike rode his bicycle for $x$ amount of time.\nSince Josh rode twice the length of time as Mike, Josh rode for $2x$ amount of time.\nSince Mike rides at a rate of $1$ mile per $5$ units of time, he rides at a rate of $\\frac{1}{5}$ miles per unit of time.\nTherefore, Josh rides at a rate of $4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{4}{5}$ miles per unit of time.\nSince both Josh and Mike are riding towards each other, their distances should be the same.\nSo, the distance Mike rides is equal to the distance Josh rides.\nThe distance Mike rides is $x \\cdot \\frac{1}{5}$ miles, and the distance Josh rides is $2x \\cdot \\frac{4}{5}$ miles.\nSetting these equal, we have $x \\cdot \\frac{1}{5} = 2x \\cdot \\frac{4}{5}$.\nCanceling out the $x$ and simplifying, we have $\\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{8}{5}$.\nThis is a contradiction, so there is no possible value of $x$ that satisfies the equation.\nTherefore, there is no possible distance that Mike could have ridden when they met.The answer is: 5",
        "Let $d$ be the distance they had ridden when they met.\nSince the distance they had ridden is equal to the distance between their houses, we have $d=13$.\nLet $t$ be the time it took for Josh to ride to Mike.\nSince Josh rides at 4/5 of Mike's rate and for twice the time, we have $\\frac{4}{5} \\cdot t = 2t$.\nSimplifying, we find $\\frac{4}{5} = 2$, which is not true.\nTherefore, there is no solution to this problem.\nThere must have been some mistake in the problem statement or our calculations.\nWithout further information, we cannot determine the value of $d$.\nThe answer is: 2",
        "Let $J$ be the number of miles Josh had ridden when they met, and let $M$ be the number of miles Mike had ridden when they met.\nWe are given that $J = 2t$ and $J = \\frac{4}{5}M$, where $t$ is the length of time Josh had ridden and $M$ is the length of time Mike had ridden.\nSince they live 13 miles apart, the distance Josh had ridden when they met is $13-J$ miles and the distance Mike had ridden when they met is $13-M$ miles.\nUsing the equation $J = 2t$, we can solve for $t$ in terms of $J$: $t = \\frac{J}{2}$.\nUsing the equation $J = \\frac{4}{5}M$, we can solve for $M$ in terms of $J$: $M = \\frac{5}{4}J$.\nSince they met, the total time they spent riding is $t + M$.\nWe know that $t = \\frac{J}{2}$ and $M = \\frac{5}{4}J$, so $t + M = \\frac{J}{2} + \\frac{5}{4}J = \\frac{9}{4}J$.\nSince the total distance they traveled is $13$, we can set up the equation $13 - J = 13 - \\frac{9}{4}J$ and solve for $J$.\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by $4$ to clear the fraction, we get $52 - 4J = 52 - 9J$.\nSimplifying, we have $5J = 4J$, which means $J = 0$.\nSince $J$ is the distance Josh had ridden when they met, this means Josh did not ride at all.\nTherefore, $M$ is equal to the total distance of 13 miles, which is $\\boxed{13}$ miles.The answer is: 13",
        "Let the distance Mike rides be $d$. \nSince they live 13 miles apart, Josh rides $2d$ distance. \nLet the time it takes for Mike to ride $d$ distance be $t$. \nSince Josh rides twice the length of time, Josh rides $2t$ time. \nSince Josh rides at four-fifths of Mike's rate, we have $\\frac{1}{5} \\cdot \\frac{d}{t} = \\frac{2d}{t}$. \nSimplifying, we get $d = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 2d$, so $d = 13$. \nTherefore, Mike rides $\\boxed{13}$ miles when they meet.\nThe answer is: 13",
        "Let the distance Mike rode when they met be $x$ miles.\nSince the distance between Josh and Mike is 13 miles, and they met, this means that Josh rode 13 - $x$ miles.\nWe are given that Josh rode for twice the length of time as Mike.\nLet the time Mike rode be $t$ hours.\nThis means that Josh rode for $2t$ hours.\nWe are also given that Josh rode at four-fifths of Mike's rate.\nThis means that Josh rode at $\\frac{4}{5}$ times Mike's rate.\nSo, we can set up the equation $\\frac{4}{5} \\cdot \\text{rate of Mike} \\cdot t = \\text{rate of Josh} \\cdot 2t$.\nThis simplifies to $\\frac{4}{5} \\cdot \\text{rate of Mike} = \\text{rate of Josh}$.\nSince distance = rate $\\cdot$ time, we can rewrite this as $\\frac{4}{5} \\cdot x = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot (13 - x)$.\nSimplifying further, we have $\\frac{4}{5} \\cdot x = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 13 - \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot x$.\nMultiplying both sides by 10 to eliminate the fractions, we get $8x = 6.5 - x$.\nCombining like terms, we have $9x = 6.5$.\nDividing both sides by 9, we find that $x = \\frac{6.5}{9} = \\frac{13}{18}$.\nTherefore, Mike ridden $\\frac{13}{18}$ miles when they met.\nThe answer is: \\frac{13}{18}",
        "let $x$ be the number of miles Mike rided when they met. Since Mike rided half the distance of Josh, we have $x = \\frac{1}{2}(13) = \\frac{13}{2}$. Since Josh rided for twice the length of time as Mike, we can set up the equation $2t = t$, where $t$ is the length of time Josh rided. Solving for $t$, we get $t = 0$. Since Josh rided at four-fifths of Mike's rate, we have $\\frac{4}{5}x = 13$. Substituting $x = \\frac{13}{2}$, we get $\\frac{4}{5} \\cdot \\frac{13}{2} = 13$.
