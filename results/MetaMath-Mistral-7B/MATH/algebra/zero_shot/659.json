        "First, we can rewrite the equation as $\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^x = 3^{x+3}$.\nSince $\\frac{1}{3} = 3^{-1}$, we can rewrite the equation as $3^{-x} = 3^{x+3}$.\nSince the bases are the same, we can equate the exponents, so $-x = x+3$.\nSimplifying, we get $2x = -3$, so $x = \\boxed{-\\frac{3}{2}}$.\nThe answer is: -\\frac{3}{2}",
        "We can rewrite the equation as $\\left(\\frac{1}{3^2}\\right)^x = 3^{x+3}$.\nThen, we can rewrite the equation as $\\frac{1}{3^{2x}} = 3^{x+3}$.\nTaking the reciprocal of both sides, we get $3^{2x} = 3^{x+3}$.\nSince the bases are equal, we can equate the exponents: $2x = x+3$.\nSolving the equation, we find $x = \\boxed{3}$.\nThe answer is: 3",
        "We can rewrite $3^{x+3}$ as $(3^x)(3^3)$.\nSo the equation becomes $\\left(\\frac{1}{9}\\right)^x = (3^x)(3^3)$.\nUsing the properties of exponents, we can rewrite $\\left(\\frac{1}{9}\\right)^x$ as $\\left(3^x\\right)^{-2}$.\nSo the equation becomes $(3^x)^{-2} = (3^x)(3^3)$.\nSince the bases are the same, we can equate the exponents, giving us $x(-2) = x + 3$.\nSimplifying, we have $-2x = x + 3$.\nSubtracting $x$ from both sides, we get $-3x = 3$.\nDividing by $-3$, we find that $x = \\boxed{-1}$.\nThe answer is: -1",
        "We can rewrite the equation as $\\left(9^{-1}\\right)^x = \\left(3^1\\right)^{x+3}$, which simplifies to $9^{-x} = 3^{x+3}$.\nUsing the fact that $a^{-b} = \\frac{1}{a^b}$, we can rewrite the equation as $\\frac{1}{9^x} = 3^{x+3}$.\nNow, we can rewrite the equation as $9^x = \\frac{1}{3^{x+3}}$.\nUsing the fact that $\\frac{1}{a^b} = a^{-b}$, we can rewrite the equation as $9^x = 3^{-x-3}$.\nSince $9$ and $3$ have the same base, we can equate the exponents, so $x = -x-3$.\nSolving for $x$, we get $2x = -3$, so $x = \\boxed{-\\frac{3}{2}}$.\nThe answer is: -\\frac{3}{2}",
        "We can rewrite $3^{x+3}$ as $\\left(3^x\\right)\\left(3^3\\right)$. So our equation becomes: $$\\frac{1}{9^x} = 3^x\\cdot 3^3 = 3^{x+3}.$$ Note that $9 = 3^2$. So we can rewrite the equation as: $$\\frac{1}{3^{2x}} = 3^x\\cdot 3^3 = 3^{x+3}.$$ Simplifying further, we have: $$\\frac{1}{3^{x+3}} = 3^x\\cdot 3^3 = 3^{x+3}.$$ Since $3^{x+3}$ is nonzero, we can cancel it out on both sides to get: $$\\frac{1}{3^{x+3}} = 3^{x+3}.$$ Taking the reciprocal of both sides, we have: $$3^{x+3} = \\frac{1}{3^{x+3}}.$$ This equation is satisfied when $x+3 = 0$. So $x = \\boxed{-3}$. The answer is: -3",
        "We can rewrite $3^{x+3}$ as $(3^x)^3$.\nTherefore, the equation becomes $\\left(\\frac{1}{9}\\right)^x = (3^x)^3$.\nTaking the reciprocal of both sides, we get $9^x = \\frac{1}{3^{3x}}$.\nSince $9 = 3^2$, we can rewrite the equation as $(3^2)^x = \\frac{1}{3^{3x}}$.\nUsing the exponent rule $a^m \\cdot a^n = a^{m+n}$, we can simplify further to $3^{2x} = 3^{-9x}$.\nSince the bases are the same, we can equate the exponents to solve for $x$:\n$2x = -9x$.\nDividing both sides by $x$, we get $2 = -9$.\nThis is a contradiction, so there are no solutions for $x$.\nThe answer is: -9"
