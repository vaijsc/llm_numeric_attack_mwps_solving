        "We can rewrite $12^2 \\cdot 18^3$ as $(2^2 \\cdot 3)^2 \\cdot (2^3 \\cdot 3^2)^3$.\nUsing the properties of exponents, this becomes $2^{2 \\cdot 2} \\cdot 3^{2 \\cdot 3} \\cdot 2^{3 \\cdot 3} \\cdot 3^{3 \\cdot 2}$.\nSimplifying, we have $2^4 \\cdot 3^6 \\cdot 2^9 \\cdot 3^6$.\nUsing the property $a^m \\cdot a^n = a^{m+n}$, we can combine the exponents to get $2^{4+9} \\cdot 3^{6+6}$.\nSimplifying further, we have $2^{13} \\cdot 3^{12}$.\nSince $2^x \\cdot 3^y$ is equal to $(2 \\cdot 3)^x \\cdot 3^y$, we can rewrite $2^{13} \\cdot 3^{12}$ as $2^{13-12} \\cdot 3^{12}$.\nSimplifying, we have $2 \\cdot 3^{12}$.\nSince $x+y$ is equal to the sum of the exponents in the prime factorization, we can conclude that $x+y=1+12=\\boxed{13}$.\nThe answer is: 13",
        "First, we can simplify the equation $12^2 \\cdot 18^3 = 2^x \\cdot 3^y$.\nWe can rewrite $12$ as $2^2 \\cdot 3$ and $18$ as $2 \\cdot 3^2$.\nSo, $12^2 \\cdot 18^3 = (2^2 \\cdot 3)^2 \\cdot (2 \\cdot 3^2)^3 = 2^4 \\cdot 3^5$.\nTherefore, $x=4$ and $y=5$, so $x+y=4+5=\\boxed{9}$.\nThe answer is: 9",
        "We can rewrite $12^2 \\cdot 18^3$ as $(2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3)^2 \\cdot (2 \\cdot 3^2)^3$.\nUsing the power of a power property, we can simplify this expression to $2^4 \\cdot 3^5 \\cdot 2^3 \\cdot 3^6$.\nCombining like terms, we have $2^{4+3} \\cdot 3^{5+6}$.\nThis simplifies further to $2^7 \\cdot 3^{11}$.\nWe are given that $2^7 \\cdot 3^{11}$ is equal to $2^x \\cdot 3^y$.\nTherefore, we have $x=7$ and $y=11$.\nThe problem asks for $x+y$, so the answer is $7+11=\\boxed{18}$.The answer is: 18",
        "First, we simplify the left side of the equation by multiplying $12^2$ and $18^3$.\n$12^2 = 144$ and $18^3 = 648$, so $12^2 \\cdot 18^3 = 144 \\cdot 648$.\nNext, we simplify the right side of the equation by expressing $2^x$ and $3^y$ in terms of $2$ and $3$.\n$2^x$ is already in the simplest form, but $3^y$ can be expressed as $3^{2y}$ because any number raised to an even power is equal to the square of that number raised to half the power.\nSo, $2^x \\cdot 3^y = 2^x \\cdot 3^{2y} = 2^x \\cdot (3^y)^2$.\nSince $2^x \\cdot (3^y)^2$ is equal to $144 \\cdot 648$, we now have $2^x \\cdot (3^y)^2 = 144 \\cdot 648$.\nTo find $x$ and $y$, we need to determine the values of $x$ and $y$ such that $2^x \\cdot (3^y)^2 = 144 \\cdot 648$.\nWe do this by finding the factors of $144 \\cdot 648$.\nThe prime factorization of $144$ is $2^4 \\cdot 3^0$ and the prime factorization of $648$ is $2^4 \\cdot 3^3$.\nSo, the prime factorization of $144 \\cdot 648$ is $2^8 \\cdot 3^3$.\nTo match this prime factorization with $2^x \\cdot (3^y)^2$, we need $x = 8$ and $y = 3$.\nTherefore, $x + y = 8 + 3 = \\boxed{11}$.\nThe answer is: 11",
        "We can rewrite $12^2$ as $(2^2 \\cdot 3)^2$ and $18^3$ as $(2 \\cdot 3^2)^3$.\nExpanding, we get $(2^4 \\cdot 3^4) \\cdot (2^6 \\cdot 3^9) = 2^{10} \\cdot 3^{13}$.\nTherefore, $x+y = 10+13 = \\boxed{23}$.\nThe answer is: 23",
        "We can rewrite $12^2 \\cdot 18^3$ as $(2^2 \\cdot 3^1)^2 \\cdot (2^1 \\cdot 3^3)$. \nUsing the properties of exponents, we can simplify this expression to $2^{2 \\cdot 2} \\cdot 3^{1+3} = 2^4 \\cdot 3^4$. \nSince $2^4 \\cdot 3^4 = 2^x \\cdot 3^y$, we can conclude that $x = 4$ and $y = 4$. \nTherefore, $x+y = 4+4 = \\boxed{8}$.The answer is: 8",
        "We can rewrite $12^2$ as $(2^2 \\cdot 3)^2 = 2^4 \\cdot 3^2$ and $18^3$ as $(2 \\cdot 3)^3 = 2^3 \\cdot 3^3$.\nSo, $12^2 \\cdot 18^3 = 2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 2^3 \\cdot 3^3 = 2^7 \\cdot 3^5$.\nTherefore, $2^x \\cdot 3^y = 2^7 \\cdot 3^5$.\nFrom here, we can conclude that $x = 7$ and $y = 5$.\nThe answer is: 12",
        "The left side of the equation can be simplified as $12^2 \\cdot 18^3 = (2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3)^2 \\cdot (2 \\cdot 3^2)^3 = 2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 2^6 \\cdot 3^4 = 2^{10} \\cdot 3^6$.\nThe right side of the equation is $2^x \\cdot 3^y$.\nTherefore, we have $2^{10} \\cdot 3^6 = 2^x \\cdot 3^y$.\nThis means that $x=10$ and $y=6$, so $x+y=10+6=\\boxed{16}$.\nThe answer is: 16"
