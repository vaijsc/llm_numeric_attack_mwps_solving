        "We can see that the degree of the right side of the equation is 6,\nso in order for the degree of $f$ to be determined by the left side,\nthe degree of $f(x)$ must be at least 6.\nDividing both sides of the equation by $(x^2-1)$, we get \\[f(x)=\\frac{5x^6-x^5+3x^4+x^3 - 25x^2 +38x -17}{x^2-1}.\\]Since the degree of the numerator is 6, the degree of $f$ must be $\\boxed{6}$.\nThe answer is: 6",
        "To find the degree of $f(x)$, we need to determine the highest power of $x$ that appears in $f(x)$.\nWe can start by factoring out the greatest common factor of $(x^2-1)$ from both sides of the equation:\n\\[(x^2-1)\\cdot f(x) = (x^2-1)(5x^6-x^5+3x^4+x^3 - 25x^2 +38x -17).\\]\nSimplifying the right side gives us:\n\\[(x^2-1)(5x^6-x^5+3x^4+x^3 - 25x^2 +38x -17) = (x^2-1)(5x^6-x^5+3x^4+x^3 - 25x^2 +38x -17).\\]\nComparing coefficients, we see that the degree of $f(x)$ is equal to the degree of $(x^2-1)$.\nSince $(x^2-1)$ is a quadratic polynomial, its degree is 2.\nTherefore, the degree of $f(x)$ is also 2.The answer is: 2",
