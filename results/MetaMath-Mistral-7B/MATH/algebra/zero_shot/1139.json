        "Using the property of logarithms, we can rewrite the equation as $x^{\\log_x 49} = 49$.\nSince $\\log_x 49$ is equal to the power to which we must raise $x$ to get 49, we have $x^{\\log_x 49} = x^{\\log_x 7^2} = (x^2)^{\\log_x 7} = 7^{\\log_x 7} = 7$.\nTherefore, $x = \\boxed{7}$.The answer is: 7",
        "We can rewrite the equation as $7^{\\log_x 49} = 7^2$.\nSince the bases are equal, we must have $\\log_x 49 = 2$.\nTo solve for $x$, we can rewrite this equation as $x^2 = 49$.\nTaking the square root of both sides, we find that $x = \\pm 7$.\nHowever, since we are looking for a positive value of $x$, we can conclude that $x = \\boxed{7}$.The answer is: 7",
        "We can rewrite the equation as $7^{\\frac{\\log 49}{\\log x}} = 49$.\nSince $49 = 7^2$, we have $7^{\\frac{\\log 49}{\\log x}} = 7^2$.\nTherefore, $\\frac{\\log 49}{\\log x} = 2$.\nTaking the reciprocal of both sides, we get $\\frac{\\log x}{\\log 49} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nCross-multiplying, we have $\\log x = \\frac{\\log 49}{2}$.\nUsing the property of logarithms, $\\log_b a^c = c\\log_b a$, we can rewrite this as $\\log x = \\log 7^2$.\nSince the logarithm function is one-to-one, this means $x = 7^2 = 49$.\nThe answer is: 49",
