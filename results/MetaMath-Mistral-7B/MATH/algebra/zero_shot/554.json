The absolute value of a negative number is given by removing the negative sign:\n   \\[\n   \\left| -\\frac{23}{9} \\right| = \\frac{23}{9}\n   \\]\n2. **Convert the fraction to a decimal**:\n   To evaluate further, we can convert \\(\\frac{23}{9}\\) into decimal form.\n   Performing the division:\n   \\[\n   23 \\div 9 \\approx 2.555\\ldots\n   \\]\n   Specifically, \\(\\frac{23}{9} = 2.\\overline{5}\\) where \\(2.5\\) repeats.\n3. **Apply the floor function**:\n   The floor function \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor\\) is defined as the greatest integer less than or equal to \\(x\\). In this case:\n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{23}{9} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor 2.555\\ldots \\right\\rfloor = 2\n   \\]\n   This is because \\(2\\) is the largest integer that is less than or equal to \\(2.555\\ldots\\).\nThus, combining all these steps, the final result is:\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\left| -\\frac{23}{9} \\right| \\right\\rfloor = 2\n\\]\nTherefore, the answer is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).",
