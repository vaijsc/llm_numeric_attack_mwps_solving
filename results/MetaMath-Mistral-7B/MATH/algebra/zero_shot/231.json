Setting this equal to 10, we have $3x - 8 = 10$, or $3x = 18$, or $x = 6$.\nSo the sum of all possible values of $x$ is $1 + (-1) + 6 = \\boxed{6}$.The answer is: 6",
        "\nTo find the sum of all possible values of $x$, we need to consider both cases separately.\nWhen $x<-5$, we have $f(x) = x^2 + 9$.\nSetting $f(x) = 10$, we get $x^2 + 9 = 10$.\nSubtracting 9 from both sides, we have $x^2 = 1$.\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get $x = \\pm 1$.\nSo the possible values of $x$ in this case are $x = -1$ and $x = 1$.\nWhen $x\\ge -5$, we have $f(x) = 3x - 8$.\nSetting $f(x) = 10$, we get $3x - 8 = 10$.\nAdding 8 to both sides, we have $3x = 18$.\nDividing both sides by 3, we get $x = 6$.\nSo the possible values of $x$ in this case are $x = 6$.\nAdding up all the possible values of $x$, we have $(-1) + 1 + 6 = \\boxed{4}$.\nThe answer is: 4",
