        "The ratio of female students to the total number of students is 4 to 9, so let's represent the total number of students as 9x.\nSince there are 396 female students, we can set up the equation 4x = 396, which gives us x = 99.\nNow we can find the total number of students by multiplying x by 9, so there are 99 * 9 = 891 students.\nThe ratio of teachers to students is 1 to 11, so we can set up the equation 1x = 891, which gives us x = 891.\nTherefore, there are 891 * 1 = 891 teachers.\nSo the answer is 891. \nThe answer is: 891",
        "The ratio of teachers to students is 1 to 11. This means that for every 1 teacher, there are 11 students.\nThe ratio of female students to the total number of students is 4 to 9. This means that out of every 4 students, 4/9 of them are female.\nWe know that there are 396 female students. This means that there are 9/4 * 396 = 990 students in total.\nSince the ratio of teachers to students is 1 to 11, we can divide the number of students by 11 to find the number of teachers.\n990 / 11 = 90\nTherefore, there are 90 teachers in the school.\nThe answer is: 90",
        "The ratio of female students to the total number of students is 4 to 9.\nThen, the total number of students can be calculated as: (4/9) * total number of students = 396.\nCross multiplying, we get: total number of students = 396 * (9/4) = 999.\nThe ratio of teachers to students is 1 to 11.\nTherefore, the number of teachers can be calculated as: (1/11) * 999 = 91.\n#### 91\nThe answer is: 91",
        "The ratio of female students to the total number of students is 4 to 9.\nThis means that out of every 4 parts, 3 parts are students and 1 part is female students.\nIf there are 396 female students, this represents 1 part out of 4 parts.\nTo find the total number of parts, we set up the equation 1/4 = 396/x, where x is the total number of parts.\nCross multiplying, we get 4 * 396 = 1 * x, so x = 1584.\nSince each part represents 9 students, we can find the total number of students by multiplying 1584 by 9, which gives us 14256 students.\nThe ratio of teachers to students is 1 to 11.\nThis means that for every 1 part representing a teacher, there are 11 parts representing students.\nTo find the number of teachers, we divide the total number of students by 11, which gives us 14256/11 = 1296 teachers.\nTherefore, there are 1296 teachers in the school.\nAnswer: 1296",
        "The ratio of teachers to students is 1 to 11, so if there are 10 students, there will be 1 teacher.\nThe ratio of female students to the total number of students is 4 to 9, so if there are 9 parts, 4 parts represent female students and 5 parts represent male students.\nIf there are 396 female students, we can set up the proportion:\n4/9 = 396/x\nCross-multiplying, we have:\n4x = 396 * 9\n4x = 3564\nDividing both sides by 4, we have:\nx = 3564 / 4\nx = 891\nSo there are 891 female students in total.\nSince the ratio of female students to the total number of students is 4 to 9, the total number of students is 891 / 4 * 9 = 2123.\nSince the ratio of teachers to students is 1 to 11, the number of teachers is 2123 / 11 = 193.\n#### 193\nThe answer is: 193",
        "We are given that the ratio of female students to the total number of students is 4 to 9. Since there are 396 female students, we can set up the equation 4/9 = 396/x, where x is the total number of students.\nCross multiplying, we have 4x = 9 * 396.\nDividing both sides by 4, we get x = 9 * 396 / 4 = 744.\nWe are also given that the ratio of teachers to students is 1 to 11. Since there are 744 students, there are 744/11 = 68 teachers.\nTherefore, there are 68 teachers in the school.\n#### 68\nThe answer is: 68",
        "The ratio of female students to the total number of students is 4 to 9.\nIf the ratio is 4 to 9, it means that out of every 4 parts, 9 parts represent female students and the remaining parts represent male students.\nSince there are 396 female students, we can set up a proportion: 4/9 = 396/x\nCross-multiplying, we get 4x = 9 * 396\nSimplifying, we get 4x = 3564\nDividing both sides by 4, we get x = 909\nSo, the total number of students is 909.\nThe ratio of teachers to students is 1 to 11.\nSince there are 11 parts representing students, and we know the total number of students is 909, we can set up another proportion: 1/11 = 909/y\nCross-multiplying, we get y = 11 * 909\nSimplifying, we get y = 9999\nSo, there are 9999 teachers.\nThe answer is: 9999",
        "The ratio of teachers to students is 1 to 11, which means for every 1 teacher, there are 11 students.\nWe can set up a proportion: 1 teacher / 11 students = x teachers / 396 students (number of female students).\nCross multiplying, we get 11x = 396.\nDividing both sides by 11, we get x = 36.\nTherefore, there are 36 teachers in the school.\n#### 36\nThe answer is: 36",
        "The ratio of female students to the total number of students is 4 to 9, so the total number of students is (4/9) x 396 = 160.\nThe ratio of teachers to students is 1 to 11, so the number of teachers is (1/11) x 160 = 14.\nTherefore, there are 14 teachers.\nThe answer is: 14"
