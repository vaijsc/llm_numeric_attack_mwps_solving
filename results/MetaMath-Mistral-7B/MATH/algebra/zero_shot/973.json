        "Let the width of the rectangle be $w$.

        "Let the width of the rectangle be $w$ cm.\nThen the length of the rectangle is $4w$ cm.\nThe perimeter of a rectangle is 2 times the sum of its length and width, or $2(4w+w)=10w$ cm.\nWe are given that the perimeter is 100 cm, so $10w=100$ and $w=10$.\nThe length of the rectangle is $4w=4(10)=40$ cm.\nThe area of a rectangle is given by the formula $A=l \\times w$, so the area of this rectangle is $40 \\times 10 = \\boxed{400}$ square centimeters.\nThe answer is: 400",

        "Let's represent the width of the rectangle as $w$.\nSince the length of the rectangle is four times its width, the length is $4w$.\nThe perimeter of the rectangle is the sum of all four sides.\nSo, we have $2w + 2(4w) = 100$.\nSimplifying this equation, we get $14w = 100$.\nDividing both sides by 14, we find that $w = \\frac{100}{14} = \\frac{25}{3}$.\nThe length of the rectangle is $4w = 4\\left(\\frac{25}{3}\\right) = \\frac{100}{3}$.\nThe area of a rectangle is found by multiplying the length by the width.\nSo, the area of this rectangle is $\\frac{25}{3} \\cdot \\frac{100}{3} = \\frac{2500}{9} = \\boxed{278}$.The answer is: 278"
