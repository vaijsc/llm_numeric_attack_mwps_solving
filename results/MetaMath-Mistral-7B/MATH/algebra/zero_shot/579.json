        "Let \\( d \\) represent the number of dimes and \\( n \\) represent the number of nickels. We are given the following information:\n1. The total number of coins is 11:\n   \\[\n   d + n = 11\n   \\]\n   \n2. The total value of the coins is 75 cents. Since a dime is worth 10 cents and a nickel is worth 5 cents, we can express this as:\n   \\[\n   10d + 5n = 75\n   \\]\nNow we have a system of equations to solve:\n1. From the first equation, we can express \\( d \\) in terms of \\( n \\):\n   \\[\n   d = 11 - n\n   \\]\n2. Next, we substitute this expression for \\( d \\) into the second equation:\n   \\[\n   10(11 - n) + 5n = 75\n   \\]\n3. Expanding this gives:\n   \\[\n   110 - 10n + 5n = 75\n   \\]\n4. Combining like terms leads to:\n   \\[\n   110 - 5n = 75\n   \\]\n5. Now, we isolate \\( n \\) by subtracting 110 from both sides:\n   \\[\n   -5n = 75 - 110\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   -5n = -35\n   \\]\n6. Dividing both sides by -5 gives:\n   \\[\n   n = 7\n   \\]\nNow we can find the number of dimes by substituting \\( n \\) back into the expression for \\( d \\):\n\\[\nd = 11 - n = 11 - 7 = 4\n\\]\nSo, Hillary has:\n- \\( d = 4 \\) dimes\n- \\( n = 7 \\) nickels\nTo verify, we check the total value:\n- Value from dimes: \\( 4 \\times 10 = 40 \\) cents\n- Value from nickels: \\( 7 \\times 5 = 35 \\) cents\n- Total value: \\( 40 + 35 = 75 \\) cents\nThus, the solution checks out.
