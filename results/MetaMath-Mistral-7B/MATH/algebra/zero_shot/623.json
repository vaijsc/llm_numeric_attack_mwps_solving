        "ez. Let's use variables to represent their ages. Let's say John's age is J and his dad's age is D.\nAccording to the problem, John is 31 years younger than his dad, so we can write the equation J = D - 31.\nThe sum of their ages is 53, so we can write the equation J + D = 53.\nWe can substitute the value of J from the first equation into the second equation: (D - 31) + D = 53.\nCombining like terms, we get 2D - 31 = 53.\nAdding 31 to both sides of the equation, we get 2D = 84.\nDividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get D = 42.\nJohn's dad is 42 years old.\nThe answer is: 42",
        "Let's say John's age is $x$ years.\nThen his dad's age is $x + 31$ years.\nThe sum of their ages is $x + (x + 31) = 53$ years.\nCombining like terms, we have $2x + 31 = 53$.\nSubtracting 31 from both sides, we get $2x = 22$.\nDividing both sides by 2, we have $x = 11$.\nTherefore, John's age is 11 years.\nSince John is 31 years younger than his dad, his dad's age is $11 + 31 = \\boxed{42}$ years.\nThe answer is: 42"
