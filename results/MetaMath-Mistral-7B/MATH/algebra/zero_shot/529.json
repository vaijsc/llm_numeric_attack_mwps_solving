        "The expression \\(\\frac{x-3}{x^2-10x+16}\\) is undefined when the denominator is equal to zero. Thus, we need to solve the equation:\n\\[\nx^2 - 10x + 16 = 0\n\\]\nTo solve this quadratic equation, we can factor it. We look for two numbers that multiply to \\(16\\) (the constant term) and add up to \\(-10\\) (the coefficient of \\(x\\)). These two numbers are \\(-2\\) and \\(-8\\). Therefore, we can factor the quadratic as:\n\\[\n(x - 2)(x - 8) = 0\n\\]\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives us the potential values of \\(x\\):\n\\[\nx - 2 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = 2\n\\]\n\\[\nx - 8 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = 8\n\\]\nThe expression is undefined for \\(x = 2\\) and \\(x = 8\\). \nNext, we find the sum of all these values:\n\\[\n2 + 8 = 10\n\\]\nThus, the sum of all values of \\(x\\) for which the expression \\(\\frac{x-3}{x^2-10x+16}\\) is undefined is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{10}\n\\]",

To find the values of \\(x\\) that make the denominator zero, we need to solve the equation:\n\\[\nx^2 - 10x + 16 = 0\n\\]\nWe will use the quadratic formula to solve this equation, which is given by:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\nIn our case, the coefficients are:\n- \\(a = 1\\)\n- \\(b = -10\\)\n- \\(c = 16\\)\nFirst, we calculate the discriminant:\n\\[\nb^2 - 4ac = (-10)^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 16 = 100 - 64 = 36\n\\]\nNow, we can substitute \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and the discriminant into the quadratic formula:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-(-10) \\pm \\sqrt{36}}{2 \\cdot 1} = \\frac{10 \\pm 6}{2}\n\\]\nThis results in two solutions:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{10 + 6}{2} = \\frac{16}{2} = 8\n\\]\n\\[\nx = \\frac{10 - 6}{2} = \\frac{4}{2} = 2\n\\]\nThus, the values of \\(x\\) that make the expression undefined are \\(x = 2\\) and \\(x = 8\\).\nTo find the sum of all values of \\(x\\) for which the expression is undefined, we add these two values:\n\\[\n2 + 8 = 10\n\\]\nWe conclude that the sum of all values of \\(x\\) for which the expression \\(\\frac{x-3}{x^2-10x+16}\\) is undefined is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{10}\n\\]",
        "To determine when the expression \\(\\frac{x-3}{x^2-10x+16}\\) is undefined, we first need to identify when the denominator is equal to zero.

We look for two numbers that multiply to \\(16\\) (the constant term) and add to \\(-10\\) (the coefficient of \\(x\\)). \nThe numbers \\(-2\\) and \\(-8\\) satisfy these conditions because:\n\\[\n-2 \\times -8 = 16 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad -2 + (-8) = -10\n\\]\nThus, we can factor the quadratic as:\n\\[\n(x - 2)(x - 8) = 0\n\\]\nWe set each factor equal to zero:\n1. \\(x - 2 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 2\\)\n2. \\(x - 8 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 8\\)\nThe values of \\(x\\) that make the expression undefined are \\(x = 2\\) and \\(x = 8\\).\nNext, we find the sum of these values:\n\\[\n2 + 8 = 10\n\\]\nThus, the sum of all values of \\(x\\) for which the expression is undefined is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{10}\n\\]",

Let's calculate the discriminant:\n\\[\nb^2 - 4ac = (-10)^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 16 = 100 - 64 = 36\n\\]\nSince the discriminant is positive, there are two distinct real roots. We can now apply the quadratic formula:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-(-10) \\pm \\sqrt{36}}{2 \\cdot 1} = \\frac{10 \\pm 6}{2}\n\\]\nCalculating the two possible values:\n1. For the plus sign:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{10 + 6}{2} = \\frac{16}{2} = 8\n   \\]\n   \n2.
