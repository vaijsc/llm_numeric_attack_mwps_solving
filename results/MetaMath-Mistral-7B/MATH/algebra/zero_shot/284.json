        "To express $-2x^2 + 4x + 5$ in the form $a(x - h)^2 + k$, we need to complete the square.\nFirst, we factor out the negative sign from the quadratic: $-2(x^2 - 2x) + 5$.\nNext, we add and subtract the square of half the coefficient of $x$ inside the parentheses: $-2(x^2 - 2x + 1 - 1) + 5$.\nWe can then rewrite the expression as $-2((x - 1)^2 - 1) + 5$.\nExpanding and simplifying, we have $-2(x - 1)^2 + 2 - 5 = -2(x - 1)^2 - 3$.\nComparing this with the desired form $a(x - h)^2 + k$, we see that $a = -2$, $h = 1$, and $k = \\boxed{-3}$.\nThe answer is: -3",
        "We complete the square by taking half of the coefficient of $x^2$ and squaring it.\nIn this case, half of $-2$ is $-1$, and $(-1)^2=1$.\nSo we add and subtract $1$ inside the square, which gives us $-2x^2 + 4x + 5 = -2(x^2 - 2x) + 5 = -2(x^2 - 2x + 1) + 5 = -2(x-1)^2 + 5$.\nTherefore, $k = \\boxed{5}$.\nThe answer is: 5",
        "To express $-2x^2 + 4x + 5$ in the form $a(x - h)^2 + k$, we want to complete the square.\nWe can do this by adding and subtracting the square of half the coefficient of $x$, which is $(2/2)^2 = 1$.\nAdding and subtracting this gives us \\[\n-2x^2 + 4x + 5 = -2(x^2 - 2x) + 5 + 1 = -2(x^2 - 2x + 1) + 6 = -2(x - 1)^2 + 6.\n\\]So $k = \\boxed{6}$.The answer is: 6",
        "To express $-2x^2 + 4x + 5$ in the form $a(x - h)^2 + k$,\nwe need to complete the square.\nTo complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of $x$,\nsquare it, and add it to the expression.\nIn this case, half of the coefficient of $x$ is $-4/2=-2$,\nand $(-2)^2=4$.\nAdding 4 to the expression, we have $-2x^2 + 4x + 5 + 4$.\nThis simplifies to $-2x^2 + 4x + 9$.\nThus, $k= \\boxed{9}$.\nThe answer is: 9",
