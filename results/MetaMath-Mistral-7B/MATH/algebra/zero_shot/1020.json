        "The quadratic expression $(x-5)(x+5)$ is equal to 0 when $x=5$ (since 5 times 5 is 25).\nSo, $x=5$ is a critical point.\nWe can test values to the left and right of $x=5$ to find the sign of the expression.\nFor $x<5$, both factors are negative, so the expression is positive.\nFor $x>5$, both factors are positive, so the expression is positive.\nSo, the inequality $(x-5)(x+5)<0$ is satisfied when $x<5$ or $x>5$.\nThe smallest integer that satisfies this inequality is $\\boxed{-4}$.\nThe answer is: -4",
        "The expression $(x-5)(x+5)$ is equal to zero when $x=5$, so the inequality holds for all $x$ such that $x<5$ or $x>5$.\nHowever, we are looking for the smallest integer that satisfies the inequality, so we need to consider the possible integer values of $x$.\nFor $x$ less than 5, the expression $(x-5)(x+5)$ is always positive (since both factors have the same sign).\nFor $x$ greater than 5, the expression $(x-5)(x+5)$ is always negative (since both factors have opposite signs).\nTherefore, the smallest integer that satisfies the inequality is $\\boxed{-4}$.\nThe answer is: -4",
        "The inequality $(x-5)(x+5)<0$ represents the product of two factors being negative.\nTo find when this inequality is true, we can consider the signs of the factors.\nThe factor $x-5$ is negative when $x<5$ and positive when $x>5$.\nThe factor $x+5$ is negative when $x<-5$ and positive when $x>-5$.\nTo find when the product is negative, we need exactly one factor to be negative and the other factor to be positive.\nThis occurs when $-5<x<5$.\nThe smallest integer that satisfies this inequality is $\\boxed{-4}$.\nThe answer is: -4",
        "The expression $(x-5)(x+5)$ will be negative when one of the factors is negative and the other is positive.\nIf $x-5<0$ and $x+5>0$, then $x<5$ and $x>-5$, so $-5<x<5$. However, this inequality does not satisfy the condition that one factor is negative and the other is positive.\nIf $x-5>0$ and $x+5<0$, then $x>5$ and $x<-5$, but this is not possible since $5$ is greater than $-5$.\nTherefore, the only solution is $x$ satisfying $x-5<0$ and $x+5>0$, which gives $x<5$ and $x>-5$.\nThe smallest integer satisfying this inequality is $\\boxed{-4}$.The answer is: -4",
        "The expression $(x-5)(x+5)$ is equal to 0 when $x=5$.\nWhen $x<5$, both factors are negative, so the product is positive.\nWhen $x>5$, both factors are positive, so the product is positive.\nTherefore, the inequality holds when $x$ is between $-5$ and $5$, but not equal to $5$.\nThe smallest integer that satisfies this inequality is $\\boxed{-4}$.The answer is: -4"
