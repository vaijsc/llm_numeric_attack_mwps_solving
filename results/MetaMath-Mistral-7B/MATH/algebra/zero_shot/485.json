    "solution": "If the total cost is fixed, then the relationship between cost per item and the number of items is inversely proportional.  Since each orange costs $\\frac{4}{3}$ as much, the same amount of money purchases $\\frac{3}{4}$ as many of them.  Taking three-fourths of 40, we find that Kim could buy $\\boxed{30}$ oranges.",

        "Let's begin by determining how much money Kim initially has.\n1. **Initial Calculation of Amount**: \n   Kim can buy 40 oranges at $3x$ cents each.\n   To find the total amount of money she has, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total money} = \\text{Number of oranges} \\times \\text{Price per orange}\n   \\]\n   Substituting in the values we have:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total money} = 40 \\times 3x = 120x \\text{ cents}\n   \\]\n   This tells us that Kim has 120x cents in total.\n2. **New Price Calculation**:\n   Now, if the price of each orange rises to $4x$ cents, we want to find out how many oranges she can now buy with her total money of 120x cents.\n3. **Number of Oranges at New Price**:\n   The number of oranges Kim can buy at the new price can be calculated by:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of oranges} = \\frac{\\text{Total money}}{\\text{New price per orange}} = \\frac{120x}{4x}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this fraction:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of oranges} = \\frac{120x}{4x} = \\frac{120}{4} = 30\n   \\]\nThus, if the price of the oranges rises to $4x$ cents each, Kim can buy **30 oranges**.",
        "Let's break this problem down step by step.\n1. **Understanding Kim's Current Situation**:\n   - Kim can buy 40 oranges at a price of \\( 3x \\) cents each.\n   - Therefore, the total amount of money Kim has is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total money} = 40 \\times 3x = 120x \\text{ cents}\n     \\]\n2. **Calculating the New Price**:\n   - If the price of each orange rises to \\( 4x \\) cents each, we need to determine how many oranges she can afford with her total money of \\( 120x \\) cents.\n3. **Calculating the Number of Oranges**:\n   - To find the number of oranges Kim can buy at the new price, we divide her total amount of money by the new price per orange:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Number of oranges} = \\frac{\\text{Total money}}{\\text{New price per orange}} = \\frac{120x}{4x}\n     \\]\n   - We can simplify this expression:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Number of oranges} = \\frac{120}{4} = 30\n     \\]\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Thus, if the price of oranges rises to \\( 4x \\) cents per orange, Kim can buy **30 oranges**.",
