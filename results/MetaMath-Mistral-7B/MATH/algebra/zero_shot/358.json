        "First, we can multiply both sides of the equation by $x+6$ to get rid of the fraction: \\[\\begin{aligned}(x+6)\\left(\\frac{9-4x}{x+6}\\right)&=7(x+6)\\\\9-4x&=7x+42\\\\-4x&=7x+33\\\\-4x-7x&=33\\\\-11x&=33\\\\x&=\\boxed{-3}.\\end{aligned}\\]\nThe answer is: -3",
        "First, we multiply both sides of the equation by $x + 6$ to get rid of the denominator: \\[(9 - 4x)(x + 6) = 7(x + 6).\\] Expanding both sides, we have \\[9x + 54 - 4x^2 - 24x = 7x + 42.\\] Simplifying, we get \\[-4x^2 + 5x + 12 = 0.\\] We can factor the quadratic as $(-4x - 3)(x - 4) = 0$. Setting each factor equal to zero, we find $x = -\\frac{3}{4}$ or $x = 4$. However, we must check for extraneous solutions. Since $x = -\\frac{3}{4}$ makes the denominator $x + 6$ zero, this solution is extraneous. Therefore, the only solution is $x = \\boxed{4}$.\nThe answer is: 4"
