        "To solve the problem, we start by expressing the sums of the two infinite geometric series.\n1. **Sum of the first series**:\n   The first series has a leading term \\( a \\) and a common ratio \\( b \\).

        "The first geometric series has a sum of $S,$ so its terms are $a, ab, ab^2, ab^3, \\dots.$\nThe sum of this geometric series is $\\frac{a}{1-b}.$\nSetting this equal to $S,$ we get $\\frac{a}{1-b} = S,$ so $a = \\frac{S}{1-b}.$\nThe second geometric series has a sum of $\\frac{1}{S},$ so its terms are $b, ab, ab^2, ab^3, \\dots.$\nThe sum of this geometric series is $\\frac{b}{1-a}.$\nSetting this equal to $\\frac{1}{S},$ we get $\\frac{b}{1-a} = \\frac{1}{S},$ so $b = \\frac{1-a}{S}.$\nFinally, we substitute $a$ and $b$ into $a+b$ to find the value of $a+b$:\n$a + b = \\frac{S}{1-b} + \\frac{1-a}{S}.$\nMultiplying the first fraction by $S$ and the second fraction by $1-b,$ we get:\n$a + b = \\frac{S^2 + (1-a)(1-b)S}{(1-b)S} = \\frac{S^2 + S - aS - Sb}{(1-b)S} = \\frac{S^2 + S - S(b+a)}{(1-b)S}.$\nSince the sum of the two geometric series is $S + \\frac{1}{S},$ we have:\n$a + b = \\frac{S^2 + S - S(b+a)}{(1-b)S} = S + \\frac{1}{S}.$\nTherefore, the value of $a+b$ is $\\boxed{2}.$The answer is: 2",
        "The first series has leading term $a,$ common ratio $b,$ and sum $S.$\nThis means that the terms of the first series are $a, ab, ab^2, ab^3, \\dots,$ and the sum of this infinite geometric series is given by the formula $S = \\frac{a}{1-b}$.\nThe second series has leading term $b,$ common ratio $a,$ and sum $1/S$.\nThis means that the terms of the second series are $b, ab, a^2b, a^3b, \\dots,$ and the sum of this infinite geometric series is given by the formula $1/S = \\frac{b}{1-a}$.\nWe are asked to find the value of $a+b$.\nWe can solve for $a$ in the equation $S = \\frac{a}{1-b}$:\n$S(1-b) = a$,\n$S(1-b) = a(1-b)$,\n$S - Sb = a - ab$,\n$S = a(1-b) + ab$,\n$S = a(1+b)$.\nSimilarly, we can solve for $b$ in the equation $1/S = \\frac{b}{1-a}$:\n$(1-a)b = S$,\n$b = \\frac{S}{1-a}$.\nSubstituting these equations into the expression $a+b$, we get:\n$a + b = a(1+b) + b$.\nFactoring out $b$, we get:\n$a + b = b(1+a)$.\nDividing both sides by $1+a$, we get:\n$b = \\frac{a+b}{1+a}$.\nSimplifying, we get:\n$b(1+a) = a+b$,\n$b+a^2b = a+b$.\nSubtracting $b$ and $a$ from both sides, we get:\n$a^2b = a$.\nDividing both sides by $a$, we get:\n$ab = 1$,\n$ab = 1$.\nSince $ab = 1$, we know that $a$ and $b$ are the reciprocals of each other.\nTherefore, $a = \\frac{1}{b",
        "The sum of an infinite geometric series is given by the formula $S = \\frac{a}{1 - r}$, where $a$ is the leading term and $r$ is the common ratio.\nFor the first series, we have $S = \\frac{a}{1 - b}$.\nFor the second series, we have $\\frac{1}{S} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{a}{1 - b}} = \\frac{1 - b}{a}$.\nWe are given that the sum of the second series is $\\frac{1}{S}$, so we can set up the equation $\\frac{1 - b}{a} = \\frac{1}{S}$.\nCross multiplying, we get $S(1 - b) = a$.\nWe are also given that $a + b = ?$, so we substitute the value of $a$ from the previous equation into the expression $a + b$ to get $(S(1 - b)) + b = ?$.\nSimplifying the expression, we get $S + b - Sb = ?$.\nWe know that the sum of an infinite geometric series is equal to the leading term divided by $1 - r$, where $r$ is the common ratio.\nSo, we have $S = \\frac{a}{1 - b}$.\nSubstituting this into the expression $S + b - Sb$, we get $\\frac{a}{1 - b} + b - \\frac{ab}{1 - b}$.\nSimplifying this expression, we get $\\frac{a(1 - b) + b - ab}{1 - b}$, which can be further simplified to $\\frac{a - ab + b - ab}{1 - b}$.\nFinally, we can simplify this expression to $\\frac{a + b - ab}{1 - b}$.\nTherefore, the value of $a + b$ is $\\boxed{1}$.\nThe answer is: 1",
        "The sum of an infinite geometric series with first term $a$ and common ratio $r$ is given by $\\frac{a}{1-r}$.\nFor the first series, we have $a$ as the leading term, common ratio $b$, and sum $S$.\nSo we have $\\frac{a}{1-b} = S$.\nSimilarly, for the second series, we have leading term $b$, common ratio $a$, and sum $\\frac{1}{S}$.\nSo we have $\\frac{b}{1-a} = \\frac{1}{S}$.\nCross multiplying, we get $bS = \\frac{1}{1-a}$.\nMultiplying both sides by $(1-a)$, we get $bS(1-a) = 1$.\nExpanding, we get $bS - bSa = 1$.\nSimplifying, we get $bS(1-a) = 1$.\nSince $bS$ cannot be zero, we can divide both sides by $bS$ to get $1-a = \\frac{1}{bS}$.\nMultiplying both sides by $bS$, we get $bS - abS = \\frac{1}{bS}$.\nExpanding, we get $bS - abS = \\frac{1}{bS}$.\nCombining like terms, we get $(1-a)bS = \\frac{1}{bS}$.\nDividing both sides by $bS$, we get $1-a = \\frac{1}{bS^2}$.\nSince $1-a$ cannot be negative, we must have $1-a > 0$, which implies $a < 1$.\nFrom $1-a = \\frac{1}{bS^2}$, we can solve for $a$ in terms of $b$, $S$, and $S^2$ as $a = 1 - \\frac{1}{bS^2}$.\nSubstituting this value of $a$ into the equation $a+b = 1-a+\\frac{1}{bS^2}$, we can simplify to get $b = \\frac{1}{bS^2}$.\nSince $b$ cannot be zero, we must have $\\frac{1}{bS^2} \\neq 0$, which implies $b"
