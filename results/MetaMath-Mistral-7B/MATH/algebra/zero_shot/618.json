    "solution": "Let the number of clowns in the parade be $c$ and the number of horses be $h$. We are looking for the value of $h$. Assuming that each clown has 2 legs and 1 head, and that each horse has 4 legs and 1 head, we can set up the following system of equations:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n2c+4h &= 30 \\\\\nc + h &= 10 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nTo solve for $h$, we need to eliminate $c$ from the equations above. We can rewrite the second equation above as $c=10-h$, and substituting this into the first equation to eliminate $c$ gives $2(10-h)+4h = 30$, or $h=5$. Thus, there are $\\boxed{5}$ horses in the parade.",

        "Every clown has 2 legs and 1 head, so if there are X clowns, then 2X legs + X heads = 30 legs + 10 heads.\nThis can be simplified to 3X = 40.\nDividing both sides by 3, we find that X = 40/3 = 13.3333...\nSince we can't have a fraction of a clown, we know that there must be 13 clowns.\nSince every clown has 2 legs, there are 13 clowns * 2 legs = 26 legs from the clowns.\nTo find the number of horses, we subtract the number of clown legs from the total number of legs: 30 legs - 26 legs = 4 legs.\nSince every horse has 4 legs, there must have been 4 horses in the parade.\n#### 4\nThe answer is: 4",
        "Each clown has 2 legs and 1 head, and each horse has 4 legs and 1 head.\nWe know that there are 30 legs in total, so we can set up an equation: 2x + 4y = 30, where x represents the number of clowns and y represents the number of horses.\nWe also know that there are 10 heads in total, so we can set up another equation: x + y = 10.\nWe can solve this system of equations by substituting the second equation into the first equation: 2(10 - y) + 4y = 30.\nSimplifying, we get: 20 - 2y + 4y = 30, and combining like terms, we get: 2y = 10.\nDividing both sides by 2, we find that y = 5, so there are 5 horses in the parade.\nThe answer is: 5",
        "We know that each horse has 4 legs and each clown has 2 legs.\nWe also know that each horse has 1 head and each clown has 1 head.\nSo, the number of horse legs is 4 times the number of horses, and the number of clown legs is 2 times the number of clowns.\nTherefore, 4x (number of horses) + 2x (number of clowns) = 30 legs.\nWe also know that the number of horses is equal to the number of heads, which is 10.\nTherefore, x (number of horses) = 10 heads.\nSubstituting this into the first equation, we have 4(10) + 2x = 30 legs.\nSimplifying, we have 40 + 2x = 30 legs.\nSubtracting 40 from both sides, we have 2x = 10 legs.\nDividing both sides by 2, we have x = 5 horses.\nSo, I saw 5 horses in the parade.\n#### 5#### 5\nThe answer is: 5",
        "Each clown has 2 legs and 1 head, so the total number of legs and heads from the clowns is $2x + x = 3x$, where $x$ is the number of clowns.\nEach horse has 4 legs and 1 head, so the total number of legs and heads from the horses is $4y + y = 5y$, where $y$ is the number of horses.\nWe are given that the total number of legs and heads is 30 and 10, respectively.\nSo, we have the equations $3x + 5y = 30$ and $x + y = 10$.\nWe can solve these equations by substitution or elimination.\nLet\u2019s solve by elimination.\nMultiply the second equation by 3 to get $3x + 3y = 30$.\nSubtract this equation from the first equation to eliminate $x$.\n$(3x + 5y) - (3x + 3y) = 30 - 30$\n$2y = 0$\n$y = 0$\nSubstitute this value back into the second equation to solve for $x$.\n$x + 0 = 10$\n$x = 10$\nTherefore, you saw $\\boxed{0}$ horses in the parade.The answer is: 0",
        "\nIf each clown has 2 legs and each horse has 4 legs, then the total number of legs we counted is 2x (clowns) + 4y (horses).\nSo, 2x + 4y = 30, where x is the number of clowns and y is the number of horses.\nWe were also given that there were 10 heads in total, which means there were x (clowns) + y (horses) heads.\nSo, x + y = 10.\nWe can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of x and y.\nWe can solve the second equation for x and substitute that expression into the first equation:\nx = 10 - y\n2(10 - y) + 4y = 30\n20 - 2y + 4y = 30\n2y = 10\ny = 5\nSubstituting this value for y into the second equation:\nx + 5 = 10\nx = 5\nSo, there were 5 clowns and 5 horses in the parade.\n#### 5\nThe answer is: 5",
        "\nEach clown has 2 legs and 1 head, and each horse has 4 legs and 1 head. \nWe know that the total number of legs is 30 and the total number of heads is 10. \nLet's set up an equation to solve for the number of clowns and horses. \n2x (number of clowns) + 4y (number of horses) = 30 legs \nx + y = 10 heads \nSimplifying the first equation, we have 2x + 4y = 30. \nSubtracting the second equation from the first equation, we get \n(2x + 4y) - (x + y) = 30 - 10 \nx + 3y = 20 \nWe can solve this equation using any method, such as substitution or elimination. \nLet's use substitution.

        "Each clown has 2 legs and 1 head.\nEach horse has 4 legs and 1 head.\nSo, the number of clowns is 30 legs - 4 legs/horse = 26 horses.\nAnd the number of horses is 10 heads - 2 heads/clown = 8 horses.\nSince we counted the horses twice, we need to divide the total by 2 to get the correct answer.\nTherefore, the number of horses you saw in the parade is (26 horses + 8 horses) / 2 = 12 horses.\n#### 12\nThe answer is: 12",
        "Each clown has 2 legs and 1 head, so the clowns contribute 2x heads and 2x legs to the total count.\nEach horse has 4 legs and 1 head, so the horses contribute 4x legs and x heads to the total count.\nWe can set up the equations:\n2x + 4x = 10 (equating the number of heads)\n6x = 10\nx = 10/6\nAfter simplifying, we find that x = 10/6 = 1.6666...\nSince we can't have a fraction of a horse, we can conclude that we saw 10 horses in the parade.\nThe answer is: 10",
        "Each horse has 4 legs.\nEach clown has 2 legs.\nThe total number of legs is 30, so there are 30/4 = 7.5 horses.\nSince we can\u2019t have half a horse, there must be 7 horses.\nThe total number of heads is 10, so there are 10-7 = 3 clowns.\nSince each clown has 1 head, there must be 3 clowns.\nTherefore, you saw 7 horses in the parade.\n#### 7#### 7\nThe answer is: 7"
