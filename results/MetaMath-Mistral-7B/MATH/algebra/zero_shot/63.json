        "The sum and product of the roots of a quadratic equation are given by the formulas $r_1 + r_2 = -\\frac{b}{a}$ and $r_1r_2 = \\frac{c}{a}$, where the quadratic equation is in the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$.\nIn this case, $a = 2$, $b = 13$, and $c = 6$, so the sum of the roots is $-\\frac{13}{2}$ and the product of the roots is $\\frac{6}{2} = 3$.\nThe product of the squares of the roots is then $(r_1^2)(r_2^2) = (r_1)^2(r_2)^2$.\nSince the square of a number is always nonnegative, we can take the square root of the product of the squares of the roots to get the product of the roots.\nSo the product of the squares of the roots is $\\sqrt{(r_1^2)(r_2^2)} = \\sqrt{(r_1)^2(r_2)^2} = |r_1r_2| = |3| = 3$.\nTherefore, the product of the squares of the solutions of $2x^2 + 13x + 6 = 0$ is $\\boxed{3}$.The answer is: 3",
