        "To determine the degree of the polynomial expression \\(2f(x) + 4g(x)\\), we first need to understand the degrees of the individual polynomials involved.\n1. **Identify the degree of each polynomial**:\n   - The polynomial \\(f(x)\\) is of degree 3. This means the highest power of \\(x\\) in \\(f(x)\\) is \\(x^3\\).\n   - The polynomial \\(g(x)\\) is of degree 5. Therefore, the highest power of \\(x\\) in \\(g(x)\\) is \\(x^5\\).\n2. **Scale the polynomials**:\n   - The expression \\(2f(x)\\) is effectively \\(2\\) times the polynomial \\(f(x)\\). Since scaling a polynomial by a non-zero constant does not change its degree, the degree of \\(2f(x)\\) remains 3.\n   - Similarly, \\(4g(x)\\) is \\(4\\) times the polynomial \\(g(x)\\). The degree of \\(4g(x)\\) also remains 5 after scaling.\n3. **Combine the scaled polynomials**:\n   - Now we can combine both terms: \\(2f(x) + 4g(x)\\). This expression will have terms contributed by both polynomials. \n   - The dominating term that will define the degree of the sum is the term with the highest degree from either \\(2f(x)\\) or \\(4g(x)\\).\n4. **Determine the maximum degree**:\n   - The degree of \\(2f(x)\\) is 3.\n   - The degree of \\(4g(x)\\) is 5.\n   - Therefore, when combining these two, the overall degree of \\(2f(x) + 4g(x)\\) is the maximum of the two degrees:\n     \\[\n     \\max(3, 5) = 5\n     \\]\nThus, the degree of the polynomial \\(2f(x) + 4g(x)\\) is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).",
        "To determine the degree of the polynomial \\( 2f(x) + 4g(x) \\), we will analyze the degrees of the polynomials involved.\n1. **Identify the degrees of \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\)**:\n   - Since \\( f(x) \\) is a polynomial of degree 3, we denote its degree as \\( \\deg(f) = 3 \\).\n   - Since \\( g(x) \\) is a polynomial of degree 5, we denote its degree as \\( \\deg(g) = 5 \\).\n2. **Calculate the degrees of the scaled polynomials \\( 2f(x) \\) and \\( 4g(x) \\)**:\n   - The degree of a polynomial is not affected by multiplying it by a non-zero constant.

        "To determine the degree of the polynomial \\(2f(x) + 4g(x)\\), we first need to recall the properties of the degrees of polynomials.\n1. **Degree of a Polynomial**: The degree of a polynomial is defined as the highest power of the variable \\(x\\) in the polynomial with a non-zero coefficient.\n2. **Degrees of \\(f(x)\\) and \\(g(x)\\)**:\n   - It is given that \\(f(x)\\) is a polynomial of degree 3, which means the highest power of \\(x\\) in \\(f(x)\\) is \\(3\\).\n   - It is also given that \\(g(x)\\) is a polynomial of degree 5, meaning the highest power of \\(x\\) in \\(g(x)\\) is \\(5\\).\n3. **Scaling the Polynomials**: \n   - The polynomial \\(2f(x)\\) is just \\(f(x)\\) scaled by the constant \\(2\\). Scaling a polynomial by a non-zero constant does not change the degree of the polynomial.
