        "Let John's age be represented as \\( ab \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are the digits of his age. The number \\( ab \\) can be expressed as \\( 10a + b \\). When we reverse the digits, John's age becomes \\( ba \\), which can be expressed as \\( 10b + a \\).\nAccording to the problem:\n1. The positive difference between their ages is 27:\n   \\[\n   |(10b + a) - (10a + b)| = 27\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   |9b - 9a| = 27\n   \\]\n   Dividing both sides by 9, we have:\n   \\[\n   |b - a| = 3\n   \\]\nThis gives us two cases:\n- Case 1: \\( b - a = 3 \\)\n- Case 2: \\( a - b = 3 \\)\n2. The sum of the digits in each age is 5:\n   \\[\n   a + b = 5\n   \\]\nNow we can solve for both cases.\n### Case 1: \\( b - a = 3 \\)\nFrom \\( b - a = 3 \\), we can express \\( b \\) in terms of \\( a \\):\n\\[\nb = a + 3\n\\]\nSubstituting into the sum of the digits equation:\n\\[\na + (a + 3) = 5\n\\]\n\\[\n2a + 3 = 5\n\\]\n\\[\n2a = 2\n\\]\n\\[\na = 1\n\\]\nThen,\n\\[\nb = 1 + 3 = 4\n\\]\nSo, John's age (\\( ab \\)) is \\( 14 \\). Therefore, his father's age (\\( ba \\)) would be \\( 41 \\).\n### Case 2: \\( a - b = 3 \\)\nFrom \\( a - b = 3 \\), we can express \\( a \\) in terms of \\( b \\):\n\\[\na = b + 3\n\\]\nSubstituting into the sum of the digits equation:\n\\[\n(b + 3) + b = 5\n\\]\n\\[\n2b + 3 = 5\n\\]\n\\[\n2b = 2\n\\]\n\\[\nb = 1\n\\]\nThen,\n\\[\na = 1 + 3 = 4\n\\]\nSo, John's age (\\( ab \\)) is \\( 41 \\). Therefore, his father's age (\\( ba \\)) would be \\( 14 \\).\n### Conclusion\nIn both cases, John's father's age when reversed equals John's age and meets both conditions. Therefore, John's father's age is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{41}\n\\]",
        "Let John's age be represented as the two-digit number \\( ab \\), where \\( a \\) is the tens digit and \\( b \\) is the units digit. This means John's age can be expressed as \\( 10a + b \\).\nWhen we reverse the digits, we obtain his father's age, represented as \\( ba \\), which can be expressed as \\( 10b + a \\).\nAccording to the problem, we have the following conditions:\n1. The positive difference between their ages is 27 years:\n   \\[\n   |(10b + a) - (10a + b)| = 27\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this equation gives:\n   \\[\n   |9b - 9a| = 27 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad |b - a| = 3\n   \\]\n2. The sum of the digits in each age is 5:\n   \\[\n   a + b = 5\n   \\]\nNow we have the two equations:\n1. \\( |b - a| = 3 \\)\n2. \\( a + b = 5 \\)\nLet's solve for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n### Case 1: \\( b - a = 3 \\)\nFrom this equation, we can express \\( b \\) in terms of \\( a \\):\n\\[\nb = a + 3\n\\]\nSubstituting this into the second equation:\n\\[\na + (a + 3) = 5 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 2a + 3 = 5 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 2a = 2 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad a = 1\n\\]\nNow substituting \\( a \\) back into the equation for \\( b \\):\n\\[\nb = 1 + 3 = 4\n\\]\nThus, John\u2019s age \\( (10a + b) = 10(1) + 4 = 14 \\) and his father\u2019s age \\( (10b + a) = 10(4) + 1 = 41 \\).\n### Verify:\n1. The ages are 14 and 41.\n2. The positive difference is:\n   \\[\n   |41 - 14| = 27\n   \\]\n   which is correct.\n3. The sum of the digits in John's age:\n   \\[\n   1 + 4 = 5\n   \\]\n   and sum of the digits in father's age:\n   \\[\n   4 + 1 = 5\n   \\]\n   which also matches.\n### Case 2: \\( a - b = 3 \\)\nFrom this equation, we can express \\( a \\) in terms of \\( b \\):\n\\[\na = b + 3\n\\]\nSubstituting this into the second equation:\n\\[\n(b + 3) + b = 5 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 2b + 3 = 5 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 2b = 2 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad b = 1\n\\]\nNow substituting \\( b \\) back into the equation for \\( a \\):\n\\[\na = 1 + 3 = 4\n\\]\nThus, John's age \\( (10a + b) = 10(4) + 1 = 41 \\) and his father\u2019s age \\( (10b + a) = 10(1) + 4 = 14 \\).\n### Final Check:\nThe ages computed in this case do not satisfy the positive difference condition as \\( |14 - 41| = 27 \\) becomes incorrect, as it leads to John's age being incorrectly calculated.\nOnly the first case gives valid ages. Therefore John's father's age is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{41}\n\\]",
        "Let's denote John's age as \\( AB \\), which represents a two-digit number where \\( A \\) is the tens digit and \\( B \\) is the units digit. Consequently, John's age can be expressed as:\n\\[\n10A + B\n\\]\nReversing the digits gives us John's father's age, which can be represented as \\( BA \\) or:\n\\[\n10B + A\n\\]\nBased on the problem, we know two things:\n1. The positive difference between their ages is 27 years:\n\\[\n|(10A + B) - (10B + A)| = 27\n\\]\nThis can be simplified into two cases:\n- Case 1: \\( (10A + B) - (10B + A) = 27 \\)\n- Case 2: \\( (10B + A) - (10A + B) = 27 \\)\nLet's simplify Case 1:\n\\[\n10A + B - 10B - A = 27\n\\]\n\\[\n9A - 9B = 27\n\\]\n\\[\nA - B = 3 \\quad \\text{(1)}\n\\]\nNow for Case 2:\n\\[\n10B + A - 10A - B = 27\n\\]\n\\[\n9B - 9A = 27\n\\]\n\\[\nB - A = 3 \\quad \\text{(2)}\n\\]\nFrom equations (1) and (2), the scenario of (1) leads us to:\n\\[\nA = B + 3\n\\]\nIn contrast, (2) gives:\n\\[\nA = B - 3\n\\]\nNext, we can check for permissible values of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) based on the second condition. The sum of the digits of each age needs to equal 5:\n\\[\nA + B = 5 \\quad \\text{(3)}\n\\]\nNow, substituting both potential values for \\( A \\) from equations (1) and (2) into equation (3):\n1.

However, since we want John's father's age, we conclude that:\n\\[\n\\text{John's father's age} = 41\n\\]\nThus, the number of years in John's father's age is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{41}\n\\]",
