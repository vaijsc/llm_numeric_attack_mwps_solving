        "Let's denote the number of free throws Jenny made in her first practice as \\( x \\).\nAccording to the problem, at each subsequent practice, she made twice as many free throws as the previous practice. Therefore, we can express the number of free throws she made at each practice as follows:\n- First practice: \\( x \\)\n- Second practice: \\( 2x \\)\n- Third practice: \\( 4x \\) (which is \\( 2 \\times 2x \\))\n- Fourth practice: \\( 8x \\) (which is \\( 2 \\times 4x \\))\n- Fifth practice: \\( 16x \\) (which is \\( 2 \\times 8x \\))\nWe know from the problem that at her fifth practice, she made 48 free throws. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[\n16x = 48\n\\]\nTo find \\( x \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 16:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{48}{16} = 3\n\\]\nThus, Jenny made \\( 3 \\) free throws at her first practice. \nTo confirm this calculation, we can check the number of free throws she made at each practice:\n- First practice: \\( x = 3 \\)\n- Second practice: \\( 2x = 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\)\n- Third practice: \\( 4x = 4 \\times 3 = 12 \\)\n- Fourth practice: \\( 8x = 8 \\times 3 = 24 \\)\n- Fifth practice: \\( 16x = 16 \\times 3 = 48 \\)\nSince the final tally matches the information given in the problem, we can conclude that the answer is correct.\nSo, the number of free throws Jenny made at her first practice is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{3}\n\\]",
