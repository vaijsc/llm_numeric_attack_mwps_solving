        "Let's denote the number of hours David worked as \\( d \\). Since Alan worked three times as many hours as David, we can denote the number of hours Alan worked as \\( 3d \\).\nBoth bricklayers place bricks at a rate of 30 bricks per hour. Thus, we can calculate the total number of bricks each bricklayer laid.\n**For David:**\nThe total number of bricks David laid:\n\\[\n\\text{Bricks laid by David} = 30 \\text{ bricks/hour} \\times d \\text{ hours} = 30d\n\\]\n**For Alan:**\nThe total number of bricks Alan laid:\n\\[\n\\text{Bricks laid by Alan} = 30 \\text{ bricks/hour} \\times 3d \\text{ hours} = 90d\n\\]\nNow, we know the total number of bricks laid by both Alan and David is 600 bricks:\n\\[\n30d + 90d = 600\n\\]\nCombining the terms:\n\\[\n120d = 600\n\\]\nNext, we solve for \\( d \\):\n\\[\nd = \\frac{600}{120} = 5\n\\]\nNow that we have determined how many hours David worked, we can find out how many bricks he laid:\n\\[\n\\text{Bricks laid by David} = 30d = 30 \\times 5 = 150\n\\]\nTherefore, the number of bricks David laid is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{150}\n\\]",
        "Let's denote the number of hours David worked as \\( x \\). Since Alan worked three times as many hours as David, Alan worked \\( 3x \\) hours.\nNow, we know that both Alan and David can place 30 bricks per hour. Therefore, the number of bricks placed by each bricklayer can be calculated as follows:\n- David's brick placement:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Bricks placed by David} = 30 \\text{ bricks/hour} \\times x \\text{ hours} = 30x \\text{ bricks}\n  \\]\n- Alan's brick placement:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Bricks placed by Alan} = 30 \\text{ bricks/hour} \\times 3x \\text{ hours} = 90x \\text{ bricks}\n  \\]\nThe total number of bricks laid by both is 600. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[\n30x + 90x = 600\n\\]\nCombining like terms:\n\\[\n120x = 600\n\\]\nNow, we can solve for \\( x \\):\n\\[\nx = \\frac{600}{120} = 5\n\\]\nSo, David worked for \\( x = 5 \\) hours. To find out how many bricks David laid, we can substitute \\( x \\) back into the equation for the number of bricks he laid:\n\\[\n\\text{Bricks placed by David} = 30x = 30 \\times 5 = 150 \\text{ bricks}\n\\]\nThus, the number of bricks laid by David is \\( \\boxed{150} \\).",
        "Let's denote the number of hours David worked as \\( x \\). \nSince Alan worked three times as many hours as David, we can express Alan's working hours as \\( 3x \\).\nNext, we know both of them lay bricks at the same rate, which is 30 bricks per hour. \nNow we can calculate the total number of bricks layered by each bricklayer:\n- **Bricks laid by David**:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Bricks by David} = 30 \\text{ bricks/hour} \\times x \\text{ hours} = 30x\n  \\]\n- **Bricks laid by Alan**:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Bricks by Alan} = 30 \\text{ bricks/hour} \\times 3x \\text{ hours} = 90x\n  \\]\nAdding both quantities gives the total number of bricks laid:\n\\[\n\\text{Total bricks} = \\text{Bricks by David} + \\text{Bricks by Alan} = 30x + 90x = 120x\n\\]\nAccording to the problem, the total number of bricks placed is 600. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\\[\n120x = 600\n\\]\nNow, solving for \\( x \\):\n\\[\nx = \\frac{600}{120} = 5\n\\]\nSo, David worked for 5 hours. Now we can determine how many bricks David laid:\n\\[\n\\text{Bricks laid by David} = 30x = 30 \\times 5 = 150\n\\]\nThus, the number of bricks that David laid is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{150}\n\\]",

        "If Alan and David placed a total of 600 bricks and Alan worked three times as many hours as David, then we can set up an equation to solve for the number of hours David worked.\nLet's say David worked x hours.\nThen Alan worked 3x hours.\nAnd the total number of bricks placed is 30x + 30(3x) = 600.\nSimplifying the equation, we get 30x + 90x = 600.\nCombining like terms, we get 120x = 600.\nDividing both sides by 120, we get x = 5.\nSo David worked 5 hours.\nTherefore, David laid 30 x 5 = 150 bricks.\n#### 150\nThe answer is: 150",
        "Let's assume that David worked x hours.\nSince Alan worked three times as many hours as David, Alan worked 3x hours.\nTherefore, Alan placed 30 bricks/hour x 3x hours = 90 bricks.\nDavid placed 30 bricks/hour x x hours = 30x bricks.\nThe total number of bricks placed is 90 + 30x bricks.\nWe know that the total number of bricks placed is 600.\nSo, 90 + 30x = 600.\nSubtracting 90 from both sides of the equation, we get 30x = 510.\nDividing both sides of the equation by 30, we get x = 17.\nTherefore, David laid 30x = 30 * 17 = 510 bricks.\n#### 510#### 510\nThe answer is: 510",
        "Let's assume that David worked x hours.\nSince Alan worked three times as many hours as David, Alan worked 3x hours.\nThe total number of bricks placed by David is 30 * x = 30x\nThe total number of bricks placed by Alan is 30 * 3x = 90x\nThe total number of bricks placed by both David and Alan is 30x + 90x = 120x\nWe know that the total number of bricks placed by both David and Alan is 600.\nTherefore, we can solve for x by setting up the equation 120x = 600\nDividing both sides of the equation by 120 gives us x = 5.\nSo, David worked 5 hours and placed 30 * 5 = 150 bricks.\n#### 150\nThe answer is: 150",
        "\nLet's assume that David worked x hours.\nSince Alan worked three times as many hours as David, Alan worked 3x hours.\nThe number of bricks that David laid is 30x.\nThe number of bricks that Alan laid is 30(3x) = 90x.\nThe total number of bricks laid by both of them is 30x + 90x = 120x.\nWe know that the total number of bricks laid is 600.\nSo, 120x = 600.\nDividing both sides of the equation by 120, we get x = 5.\nTherefore, David laid 30x = 30(5) = 150 bricks.\n#### 150\nThe answer is: 150",
        "\nThere are two bricklayers, Alan and David.\nAlan places 30 bricks per hour, and David also places 30 bricks per hour.\nWe are told that Alan worked three times as many hours as David.\nLet's say David worked X hours.\nThen Alan worked 3X hours.\nThe total number of bricks placed by Alan and David is 600.\nAlan placed 30 bricks per hour, so in 3X hours, he placed 30 * 3X = 90X bricks.\nDavid placed 30 bricks per hour, so in X hours, he placed 30 * X = 30X bricks.\nThe total number of bricks placed is 90X + 30X = 120X.\nWe are given that the total number of bricks placed is 600, so 120X = 600.\nTo solve for X, we divide both sides of the equation by 120:\nX = 600 / 120 = 5.\nTherefore, David worked 5 hours and placed 30 * 5 = 150 bricks.\n#### 150\nThe answer is: 150",
        "Each hour, Alan and David place a total of 30 bricks + 30 bricks = 60 bricks.\nIf Alan worked three times as many hours as David, let\u2019s say Alan worked x hours and David worked x/3 hours, then the total number of bricks laid is x*30 + x/3*30 = 600.\nSimplifying this equation, we get 30x + 10x = 600.\nCombining like terms, we get 40x = 600.\nDividing both sides by 40, we get x = 15.\nSo, Alan worked 15 hours and David worked 15/3 = 5 hours.\nTherefore, David laid 5 hours * 30 bricks/hour = 150 bricks.\n#### 150\nThe answer is: 150",
        "If Alan and David each place 30 bricks per hour, then the number of bricks Alan placed in x hours is 30*x.\nSince Alan worked three times as many hours as David, then David worked x/3 hours.\nThe total number of bricks placed is 30*x + (30/3)*(x/3) = 30x + 10x/3 = 30x(1+10/3) = 30x(6/3) = 60x/3 = 20x.\nSince the total number of bricks placed is 600, then 20x = 600.\nDividing both sides by 20, we find x = 30.\nTherefore, David placed 30/3 = 10 bricks.\n#### 10\nThe answer is: 10"
