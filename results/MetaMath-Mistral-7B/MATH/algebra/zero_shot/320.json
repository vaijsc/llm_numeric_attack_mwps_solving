        "First, we can rewrite the inequality as $-5.6 \\leq x-2 \\leq 5.6$.\nAdding 2 to each part of the inequality, we have $-3.6 \\leq x \\leq 7.6$.\nThe integers in this range are $-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7$.\nCounting them up, we find that there are $\\boxed{11}$ integers in the solution set.\nThe answer is: 11",
        "To find the solution set, we need to consider two cases:\nWhen $x-2$ is nonnegative, $|x-2|=x-2$, so our inequality becomes $x-2\\leq5.6$. Solving this gives us $x\\leq7.6$.\nWhen $x-2$ is negative, $|x-2|=-(x-2)$, so our inequality becomes $-(x-2)\\leq5.6$. Simplifying, we have $-x+2\\leq5.6$, or $x\\geq-3.6$.\nCombining these two cases, the solution set is $-3.6\\leq x\\leq7.6$, or simply $-3\\leq x\\leq8$.\nCounting the integers in this range, we have $\\boxed{6}$ integers: $-3,-2,-1,0,7,8$.\nThe answer is: 6",
        "We can rewrite the inequality as $-5.6\\leq x-2\\leq5.6$.\nAdding 2 to all sides, we get $-3.6\\leq x\\leq7.6$.\nThe integers in this range are $-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7$.\nCounting these integers, we find that there are $\\boxed{11}$ integers in the solution set.The answer is: 11"
