        "The formula for simple interest is $I=P(r)(t)$, where $I$ is the interest earned, $P$ is the principal (initial investment), $r$ is the interest rate, and $t$ is the time in years.\nIn this case, the principal is $2000$, the interest rate is $5\\%$ (or $0.05$), and the time is $18-0=18$ years.\nSo the interest earned is $2000(0.05)(18)=10(0.05)(18)=900$.\nThe total amount of money Frederick will have is the principal plus the interest earned, so it is $2000+900=\\boxed{2900}$.\nThe answer is: 2900",
        "The formula for compound interest is given by $A = P(1 + r)^n$, where:\n- $A$ is the final amount\n- $P$ is the principal (initial amount)\n- $r$ is the interest rate (as a decimal)\n- $n$ is the number of compounding periods\nIn this case, the principal is $\\$2000$, the interest rate is $0.05$, and the number of compounding periods is $18$ years.\nPlugging these values into the formula, we have $A = 2000(1 + 0.05)^{18}$.\nEvaluating this expression, we find $A \\approx \\$4129.47$.\nTherefore, Frederick will have approximately $\\$4129.47$ when he can collect the money at the age of $18$.The answer is: 4129.47",

        "Since Frederick invested $\\$2000$ at a simple interest rate of $5\\%$ per year, the amount of money he will have when he collects the money at the age of $18$ can be calculated by using the formula for compound interest: $A = P(1 + r/n)^(n \\cdot t)$, where $A$ is the final amount, $P$ is the principal (initial investment), $r$ is the interest rate, $n$ is the number of times that interest is compounded per year, and $t$ is the number of years.\nIn this case, $P = \\$2000$, $r = 5\\% = 0.05$, $n = 1$ (since the interest is compounded annually), and $t = 18$ years.\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get $A = 2000(1 + 0.05/1)^(1 \\cdot 18) = 2000(1.05)^18$.\nEvaluating this expression, we have $A = 2000(3.0264179) = 6052.834$.\nTherefore, Frederick will have $\\boxed{\\$6052.834}$ when he collects the money at the age of $18$.The answer is: 6052.834",
