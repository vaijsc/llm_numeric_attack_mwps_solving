        "To find the cost of one pencil, we can break down the problem step by step.\n1. **Find the cost of one pen**:\n   We know that seven pens cost $9.24. To find the cost of one pen, we can divide the total cost by the number of pens:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of one pen} = \\frac{9.24}{7}\n   \\]\n   Performing the division:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of one pen} = 1.32 \\text{ (in dollars)}\n   \\]\n2. **Find the total cost of three pens**:\n   Since eleven pencils cost as much as three pens, we need the cost of three pens. We simply multiply the cost of one pen by 3:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of three pens} = 3 \\times 1.32 = 3.96 \\text{ (in dollars)}\n   \\]\n3. **Relate the cost to pencils**:\n   We know now that the total cost of three pens is equal to the cost of eleven pencils:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of 11 pencils} = 3.96 \\text{ (in dollars)}\n   \\]\n4. **Find the cost of one pencil**:\n   To find the cost of one pencil, divide the total cost for eleven pencils by 11:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of one pencil} = \\frac{3.96}{11}\n   \\]\n   Performing the division:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of one pencil} \\approx 0.36 \\text{ (in dollars)}\n   \\]\n5. **Convert the cost to cents**:\n   Since we want the cost in cents, we multiply by 100 (as there are 100 cents in a dollar):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of one pencil in cents} = 0.36 \\times 100 = 36\n   \\]\nThus, the cost of one pencil is \\(\\boxed{36}\\) cents.",
        "To find the cost of one pencil in cents, we first need to determine the cost of one pen. Given that seven pens cost \\$9.24, we can calculate the cost of one pen as follows:\n1. **Calculate the cost of one pen**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of one pen} = \\frac{\\text{Total cost of seven pens}}{\\text{Number of pens}} = \\frac{9.24}{7}\n   \\]\n   Performing the division:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of one pen} = 1.32 \\quad \\text{(This means one pen costs \\$1.32)}\n   \\]\n2. **Determine the cost of three pens**:\n   Now that we know the cost of one pen, we can find out how much three pens cost:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of three pens} = 3 \\times \\text{Cost of one pen} = 3 \\times 1.32 = 3.96 \\quad \\text{(This means three pens cost \\$3.96)}\n   \\]\n3. **Relate pencils and pens**:\n   According to the information provided, the cost of eleven pencils is equal to the cost of three pens. Therefore:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of eleven pencils} = 3.96\n   \\]\n4. **Calculate the cost of one pencil**:\n   To find the cost of one pencil, we need to divide the total cost of eleven pencils by eleven:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of one pencil} = \\frac{\\text{Cost of eleven pencils}}{11} = \\frac{3.96}{11}\n   \\]\n   Performing the division:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of one pencil} = 0.36 \\quad \\text{(This means one pencil costs \\$0.36)}\n   \\]\n5. **Convert the cost from dollars to cents**:\n   Since the problem asks for the cost in cents, we need to convert dollars to cents:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost in cents} = 0.36 \\text{ dollars} \\times 100 = 36 \\text{ cents}\n   \\]\nTherefore, the cost of one pencil is \\(\\boxed{36}\\) cents.",

        "We know that seven pens cost $\\$ 9.24$, so the cost of one pen is $\\frac{\\$ 9.24}{7}$ cents.\nAnd we also know that eleven pencils cost as much as three pens, so the cost of one pencil is $\\frac{{\\frac{{\\$ 9.24}}{7} \\times 3}}{{11}}$ cents.\nSimplifying, we find that the cost of one pencil is 36 cents.\nThe answer is: 36",
        "We can set up the equation $\\frac{11}{3} \\times p = 9.24$, where $p$ represents the cost of one pencil in cents.\nSimplifying, we have $11p = 27.92$.\nDividing both sides by 11, we find that $p = \\frac{27.92}{11} \\approx 2.54$.\nTherefore, the cost of one pencil is $\\boxed{254}$ cents.\nThe answer is: 254",
        "We are given that seven pens cost $\\$ 9.24$.\nLet's say the cost of one pen is $p$ cents.\nSo, the cost of seven pens is $7p$ cents.\nWe are also given that eleven pencils cost as much as three pens.\nLet's say the cost of one pencil is $c$ cents.\nSo, the cost of eleven pencils is $11c$ cents.\nSince eleven pencils cost as much as three pens, we have the equation $11c = 3p$.\nFrom the given information, we know that $7p = 924$ cents.\nWe can rewrite this equation as $p = \\frac{924}{7} = 132$ cents.\nSubstituting this value into the equation $11c = 3p$, we have $11c = 3(132)$.\nSimplifying, we find $11c = 396$.\nDividing both sides by 11, we get $c = 36$.\nTherefore, the cost of one pencil is $\\boxed{36}$ cents.The answer is: 36",
        "We are given that seven pens cost $\\$ 9.24$. Since each pen costs the same amount, the cost of one pen is $\\frac{9.24}{7} = 1.32$ dollars, or 132 cents.\nWe are also given that eleven pencils cost as much as three pens. This means that the cost of one pencil is equal to the cost of one pen divided by 3.\nTherefore, the cost of one pencil is $\\frac{132}{3} = \\boxed{44}$ cents.\nThe answer is: 44"
