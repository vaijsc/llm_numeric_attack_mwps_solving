        "To find the distance from the point \\((x, y)\\) to the origin, we first need to determine the values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) using the equations given:\n1. We have the equations:\n   \\[\n   x + y = 13\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   xy = 24\n   \\]\n2. From the first equation, we can express \\(y\\) in terms of \\(x\\):\n   \\[\n   y = 13 - x\n   \\]\n3. Now we can substitute \\(y\\) into the second equation:\n   \\[\n   x(13 - x) = 24\n   \\]\n4. This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   13x - x^2 = 24\n   \\]\n5.

Now substituting into the quadratic formula:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{13 \\pm \\sqrt{73}}{2}\n   \\]\n9.
