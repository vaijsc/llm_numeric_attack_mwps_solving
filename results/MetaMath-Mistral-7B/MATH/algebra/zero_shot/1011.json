    "solution": "We don't know the $y$-intercept, so let the $y$-intercept be $a$, where $1\\le a \\le 9$. Our line contains the points $(0,a)$ and $(4,365)$, so its slope is $\\frac{365-a}{4-0}=\\frac{365-a}{4}$. We are trying to find the smallest possible value of this expression, to minimize the slope. The denominator is fixed, so we must find the smallest possible value of the numerator, $365-a$. The smallest value will occur when $a$ is as large as possible, so $a=9$. Then the slope will be $\\frac{365-9}{4}=\\frac{356}{4}=\\boxed{89}$.",

Using the slope-intercept form $y=mx+b$, we can write the equation of the line as $365 = 4m + b$.\nThe slope of a line is defined as the change in $y$ divided by the change in $x$. In this case, the change in $x$ is 4, so the slope is $\\frac{365-b}{4}$. To find the minimum possible slope, we want to minimize the value of $b$, so we substitute the lower bound of $b$, which is 1, into the equation: $\\frac{365-1}{4}=\\frac{364}{4}=91$.\nTherefore, the minimum possible slope of the line is $\\boxed{91}$.The answer is: 91",
        "The $y$-intercept of the line is the point where the line crosses the $y$-axis, which is when $x=0$.\nSo, the $y$-intercept is $(0,b)$ for some value of $b$.\nWe know that the line passes through $(4,365)$, so we can use the point-slope form of a line to find the slope: \\[m=\\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}=\\frac{365-b}{4-0}.\\] Since the $y$-intercept is between 1 and 9, we have $1\\leq b \\leq 9$.\nTo find the minimum possible slope, we want to minimize the expression $\\frac{365-b}{4}$.\nThis occurs when $b$ is minimized, so we set $b=1$: \\[m=\\frac{365-1}{4}=\\frac{364}{4}=\\boxed{91}.\\] The answer is: 91",

In this case, the equation of the line passing through $(4, 365)$ and $(0, 1)$ is\n\\[y - 365 = \\frac{1 - 365}{0 - 4}(x - 4).\\]\nSimplifying, we have $y - 365 = -91(x - 4)$.\n2.
