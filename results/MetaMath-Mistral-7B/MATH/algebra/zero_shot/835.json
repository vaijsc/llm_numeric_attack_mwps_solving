        "To write the quadratic in the form $a(x+b)^2+c$, we need to complete the square.\nWe observe that $a=3$ since the coefficient of $x^2$ is 3.\nTo complete the square, we add $(24/2)^2=36$ to both sides, so the quadratic can be written as \\[3(x-12)^2-44.\\]Thus, $a+b+c=3+(-12)+(-44)=\\boxed{-49}$.The answer is: -49",
        "First, we factor the quadratic: $3x^2-24x+72 = (3x-12)(x-6)$.\nSo, we can write the quadratic in the form $a(x+b)^2+c$, where $a = 3$, $b = -12/3 = -4$, and $c = 72$.\nTherefore, $a+b+c = 3 + (-4) + 72 = \\boxed{69}$.The answer is: 69",
        "We want to write the quadratic $3x^2-24x+72$ in the form $a(x+b)^2+c$.\nTo do this, we need to complete the square.\nFirst, we factor out the leading coefficient of $3$: $3(x^2-8x+24)$.\nNext, we complete the square by adding and subtracting $(8/2)^2=16$ inside the parentheses: $3(x^2-8x+16-16+24)$.\nWe can rewrite this as $3((x-4)^2-16+24)$.\nSimplifying, we have $3(x-4)^2+3(8)$.\nFinally, we can rewrite this as $3(x-4)^2+24$.\nTherefore, $a+b+c=3+(-4)+24=\\boxed{17}$.\nThe answer is: 17",
