        "\nFrom the graph, we can see that the vertex of the parabola is at the point $(1,3)$.\nSince the vertex has coordinates $(h,k)$ for a parabola of the form $y=a(x-h)^2+k$, we have $h=1$ and $k=3$.\nSubstituting these values into the equation, we get $y=a(x-1)^2+3$.\nThe coefficient $a$ can be determined by plugging in the point $(0,1)$.\nWe have $1=a(0-1)^2+3$, so $a(-1)^2+3=1$.\nSimplifying, we get $a-1=1$, so $a=2$.\nTherefore, the equation of the parabola is $y=2(x-1)^2+3$.\nExpanding, we have $y=2x^2-4x+2$.\nFinally, the sum $a+b+c$ is $2+(-4)+2=\\boxed{0}$.\nThe answer is: 0",
        "The graph of the quadratic function $y=ax^2+bx+c$ is a parabola.\nFrom the graph, we can see that the vertex of the parabola is at the point $(1,3)$.\nThis means that the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is 1, so the equation of the parabola can be written as $y=a(x-1)^2+3$.\nWe can substitute some points on the graph to find the values of $a$ and $c$.\nFor example, when $(x,y)=(0,1)$, we have $1=a(0-1)^2+3$, which simplifies to $1=a+3$ and $a=-2$.\nSubstituting this value of $a$ into the equation, we have $y=-2(x-1)^2+3$.\nWe can again substitute some points on the graph to find the value of $c$.\nFor example, when $(x,y)=(2,0)$, we have $0=-2(2-1)^2+3$.\nSimplifying, we have $0=-2+3$ and $c=1$.\nFinally, we have $a+b+c=-2+0+1=\\boxed{-1}$.\nThe answer is: -1",
        "From the graph, we can see that the vertex of the parabola is $(1,-3)$. Hence, the equation of the parabola can be written as $y = a(x-1)^2 - 3$ for some value of $a$.\nTo find the value of $a$, we can use the fact that the vertex of the parabola is $(1,-3)$. Plugging in $(1,-3)$ into the equation, we get $-3 = a(0)^2 - 3$. Simplifying, we find that $a = 0$.\nTherefore, the equation of the parabola is $y = 0(x-1)^2 - 3 = -3$.\nFrom this equation, we can see that $a = 0$, $b = 0$, and $c = -3$. Therefore, $a + b + c = 0 + 0 + (-3) = -3$.\nThe answer is: -3",
        "The graph is a downward-opening parabola with vertex at the point $(1,3)$.\nThis means that the vertex form of the quadratic equation is $y=a(x-1)^2+3$.\nWe can find $a$ by considering the $y$-coordinate of another point on the graph.\nThe graph passes through the point $(0,1)$, so we have $1=a(0-1)^2+3$.\nSimplifying, we get $1=a+3$, which means $a=-2$.\nTherefore, the equation of the quadratic is $y=-2(x-1)^2+3$.\nExpanding, we get $y=-2(x^2-2x+1)+3$, which simplifies to $y=-2x^2+4x+1$.\nThus, $a+b+c=-2+4+1=\\boxed{3}$.\nThe answer is: 3",
