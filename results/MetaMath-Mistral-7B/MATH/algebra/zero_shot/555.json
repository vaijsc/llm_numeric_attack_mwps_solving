        "We can factor the quadratic equation as $(x-12)(x+3)=0$.\nSetting each factor equal to zero, we find that $x-12=0$ or $x+3=0$.\nThe first equation gives us $x=12$ and the second equation gives us $x=-3$.\nSince we are looking for the largest possible value of $x$, the answer is $\\boxed{12}$.\nThe answer is: 12",
        "The equation $x^2-5x-36=0$ can be factored as $(x-9)(x+4)=0$.\nThis equation has two solutions: $x=9$ and $x=-4$.\nThe largest possible value of $x$ is $\\boxed{9}$.\nThe answer is: 9",
