        "We can rewrite $9997^2$ as $(10000-3)^2$.\nExpanding, we get $10000^2 - 2(10000)(3) + 3^2$.\nSimplifying, we have $100000000 - 60000 + 9$.\nThus, $9997^2 = \\boxed{99960099}$.\nThe answer is: 99960099",
        "We can rewrite 9997 as $(10000-3)$.\nUsing the difference of squares, we have $(10000-3)^2 = 10000^2 - 2 \\cdot 10000 \\cdot 3 + 3^2 = 100000000 - 60000 + 9 = 100000009$.\nSo the square of 9997 is $100000009$.\nThe answer is: 100000009",
        "We can use the shortcut for square: $(a+b)^2=a^2+2ab+b^2$.\nIn this case, $9997^2=(9990+7)^2$.\n$9990^2$ is easy to calculate: $9990^2=99800100$.\n$2\\times7\\times9990=99940$.\n$7^2=49$.\nTherefore, $9997^2=99800100+2\\times7\\times9990+49=99800100+159930+49=\\boxed{99950549}$.\nThe answer is: 99950549",
        "We can use the property $(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$.\nLet\u2019s choose $a = 9$ and $b = 99$.\nWe have $(9 + 99)^2 = 9^2 + 2(9)(99) + 99^2$.\nCalculating, we have $81 + 1711 + 9801 = 10693$.\nSo, $9997^2 = 10693^2$.\nWe can further simplify this by noticing that $10693$ is $81$ more than a perfect square, specifically $(103)^2$.\nTherefore, $9997^2 = (103^2 + 81)^2$.\nExpanding, we have $9997^2 = 10929 + 16286 + 81^2$.\nCalculating, we have $9997^2 = 25825$.\nSo, the square of $9997$ is $\\boxed{25825}$.The answer is: 25825",
        "We can rewrite the square of 9997 as $(10000-3)^2$.\nUsing the difference of squares, we have $(10000^2 - 2(10000)(3) + 3^2)$.\nSimplifying, we get $(10000^2 - 60000 + 9)$.\nThe first term is $10000^2=100000000$.\nThe second term is $-60000$.\nThe third term is $9$.\nAdding them up, we get $100000000 - 60000 + 9 = \\boxed{999901}$.\nThe answer is: 999901",
        "To compute the square of 9997, we can first multiply 9997 by itself to get $9997^2$.\nWe can then simplify the expression $9997^2$ by using the fact that $(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$.\nIn this case, $a=9997$ and $b=0$, so we have $9997^2 = (9997+0)^2 = 9997^2 = 9997^2$.\nTherefore, the square of 9997 is $\\boxed{9997^2}$.The answer is: 9997^2",
        "To square 9997, we can first break it down into prime factors: $9997 = 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 157$.\nTo find the square of 9997, we can square each prime factor individually and then multiply them back together.\n$7^2 = 49$\n$11^2 = 121$\n$157^2 = 2409$\nNow, we multiply these three squares together: $49 \\cdot 121 \\cdot 2409 = 11874001$.\nSo, the square of 9997 is $\\boxed{11874001}$.The answer is: 11874001"
