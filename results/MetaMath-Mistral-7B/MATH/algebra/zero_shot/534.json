        "We know that Frank answered $80$ questions and scored $232$ points.\nEach correct answer scored $5$ points, each incorrect answer scored $-2$ points, and each question not answered scored zero points.\nLet $x$ be the number of questions Frank answered correctly.\nThen the number of questions Frank answered incorrectly is $80 - x$, and the number of questions Frank did not answer is $100 - 80 = 20$.\nWe can write the equation $5x - 2(80 - x) = 232$ to represent the points Frank scored.\nSimplifying this equation, we get $5x - 160 + 2x = 232$.\nCombining like terms, we get $7x - 160 = 232$.\nAdding $160$ to both sides, we get $7x = 392$.\nDividing both sides by $7$, we find that $x = 56$.\nTherefore, Frank answered $\\boxed{56}$ questions correctly.\nThe answer is: 56",
        "If Frank answered $80$ questions, then he didn't answer $100 - 80 = 20$ questions.\nLet $x$ be the number of questions Frank answered correctly.\nThen the number of questions Frank answered incorrectly is $80 - x$.\nWe know that each correct answer scored $5$ points and each incorrect answer scored $-2$ points.\nSo the total score from the questions Frank answered correctly is $5x$ and the total score from the questions he answered incorrectly is $-2(80 - x)$.\nWe also know that each question not answered scored zero points, so the score from the questions not answered is $0$.\nThe total score Frank obtained is $232$.\nWe can write the equation $5x - 2(80 - x) = 232$ and solve for $x$.\nSimplifying, we get $5x - 160 + 2x = 232$.\nCombining like terms, we get $7x - 160 = 232$.\nAdding $160$ to both sides, we get $7x = 392$.\nDividing by $7$, we find $x = 56$.\nTherefore, Frank answered $\\boxed{56}$ questions correctly.The answer is: 56",
        "Frank answered $80$ questions and scored $232$ points.\nLet $h$ be the number of questions he answered correctly.\nThen the number of questions he answered incorrectly is $80 - h$.\nThe total score from the questions he answered correctly is $5h$.\nThe total score from the questions he answered incorrectly is $-2(80 - h)$.\nThe total score from the unanswered questions is $0$.\nThe total score from all the questions is $232$.\nSo we can write the equation $5h - 2(80 - h) + 0 = 232$.\nSimplifying, we get $5h - 160 + 2h = 232$.\nCombining like terms, we get $7h - 160 = 232$.\nAdding $160$ to both sides, we get $7h = 392$.\nDividing both sides by $7$, we get $h = 56$.\nTherefore, Frank answered $\\boxed{56}$ questions correctly.The answer is: 56",
        "Let $x$ be the number of questions Frank answered correctly and $y$ be the number of questions he answered incorrectly.\nWe know that Frank answered $80$ questions in total, so $x+y=80$.\nWe also know that Frank scored $232$ points in total, so $5x-2y=232$.\nWe can solve this system of equations to find the values of $x$ and $y$.\nMultiplying the first equation by $5$ gives $5x+5y=400$.\nAdding this equation to the second equation gives $6x=632$, so $x=105$.\nSubstituting this value of $x$ into the first equation gives $105+y=80$, so $y=-25$.\nTherefore, Frank answered $\\boxed{105}$ questions correctly.The answer is: 105",

        "So, Frank answered $80$ questions and scored $232$ points. Let's call the number of questions he answered correctly as $x$.
