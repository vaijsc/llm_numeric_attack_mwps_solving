        "Let's assume the cost of a pencil is $p$ cents and the cost of a jumbo eraser is $e$ cents.\nWe can set up a system of equations based on the given information:\n$3p + e = 124$  (equation 1)\n$5p + e = 182$  (equation 2)\nTo find the cost of a pencil, we need to find the value of $p$.\nWe can solve this system of equations by subtracting equation 1 from equation 2:\n$(5p + e) - (3p + e) = 182 - 124$\n$2p = 58$\n$p = 29$\nTherefore, the cost of a pencil is $\\boxed{29}$ cents.\nThe answer is: 29",
        "Let the cost of a pencil be $p$ cents and the cost of a jumbo eraser be $q$ cents.\nWe can set up a system of equations using the given information:\n$3p + q = 124$ (equation 1)\n$5p + q = 182$ (equation 2)\nWe can subtract equation 1 from equation 2 to eliminate $q$:\n$(5p + q) - (3p + q) = 182 - 124$\n$2p = 58$\n$p = 29$\nTherefore, the cost of a pencil is $\\boxed{29}$ cents.The answer is: 29"
