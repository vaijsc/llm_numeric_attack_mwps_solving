        "We can distribute the multiplication: \\[(5-3i)(-4+3i) = 5(-4) + 5(3i) - 3i(-4) - 3i(3i).\\]\nSimplifying each term, we get \\[-20 + 15i + 12i - 9i^2.\\]\nSince $i^2 = -1$, we can further simplify to \\[-20 + 15i + 12i + 9 = \\boxed{6 + 27i}.\\]\nThe answer is: 6+27i",
        "$(5-3i)(-4+3i)$\n= $5(-4)+5(3i)-3i(-4)+3i(3i)$\n= $-20+15i+12i-9i^2$\n= $-20+27i+9$\n= $9+27i$\nThe answer is: 9+27i",
        "Using the distributive property, we have\n\\begin{align*}\n(5-3i)(-4+3i) &= 5(-4) + 5(3i) - 3i(-4) - 3i(3i) \\\\\n&= -20 + 15i + 12i - 9i^2 \\\\\n&= -20 + 27i - 9(-1) \\\\\n&= -20 + 27i + 9 \\\\\n&= 9 + 27i.\n\\end{align*}\nSo $(5-3i)(-4+3i) = \\boxed{9 + 27i}$.The answer is: 9+27i"
