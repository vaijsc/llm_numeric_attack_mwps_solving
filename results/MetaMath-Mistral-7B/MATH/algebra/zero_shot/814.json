        "If we add the same number $x$ to both the numerator and denominator of $\\frac{5}{8}$,\nwe get the fraction $\\frac{5+x}{8+x}$.\nWe want this fraction to be equal to 0.4, so we set up the equation $\\frac{5+x}{8+x}=0.4$.\nWe can also write this equation as $5+x=0.4(8+x)$.\nExpanding the right side, we have $5+x=3.2+0.4x$.\nSubtracting $x$ from both sides, we get $5=3.2+0.4x-x$.\nSimplifying, we have $5=0.2+0.4x$.\nSubtracting 0.2 from both sides, we get $4.8=0.4x$.\nDividing both sides by 0.4, we get $x=\\frac{4.8}{0.4}=\\frac{24}{2}=12$.\nTherefore, the number we need to add is $\\boxed{12}$.\nThe answer is: 12",
        "We want to find a number $x$ such that $\\frac{5 + x}{8 + x} = 0.4$.\nCross-multiplying gives $5 + x = 0.4(8 + x)$, or $5 + x = 3.2 + 0.4x$.\nSubtracting $x$ and $3.2$ from both sides gives $5 - 3.2 = 0.4x - x$, or $1.8 = -0.6x$.\nDividing both sides by $-0.6$ gives $x = \\frac{-1.8}{-0.6}$.\nSimplifying gives $x = \\frac{3}{1}$.\nTherefore, the number we are looking for is $\\boxed{3}$.\nThe answer is: 3",
