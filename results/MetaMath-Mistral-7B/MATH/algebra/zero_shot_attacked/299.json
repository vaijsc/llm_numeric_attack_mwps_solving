        "We can rewrite the equation as $2^{x+2} = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7$.\nSince $2^{x+2}$ is a power of 2, we know that $x+2$ must be a multiple of 2.\nThus, $x$ must be an even number.\nWe also know that $2^{x+2}$ is equal to $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7$.\nTaking the logarithm base 2 of both sides, we get $x+2 = \\log_2(2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7)$.\nSimplifying, $\\log_2(2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7) = \\log_2(2) + \\log_2(3) + \\log_2(7)$.\nUsing the properties of logarithms, we can rewrite this as $\\log_2(2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7) = \\log_2(2) + \\log_2(3) + \\log_2(7) = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6$.\nTherefore, $x+2 = 6$ and $x = 4$.\nThe answer is: 4",
        "We can rewrite the equation as $2^x \\cdot 2^2 = 42$.\nWe can then divide both sides by $2^2$ to get $2^x = \\frac{42}{2^2}$.\nSimplifying the right side, we have $2^x = \\frac{42}{4}$.\nSince $2^2 = 4$, we can simplify further to $2^x = \\frac{21}{2}$.\nTaking the logarithm base 2 of both sides, we get $x = \\log_2\\left(\\frac{21}{2}\\right)$.\nUsing the property of logarithms, we can rewrite this as $x = \\log_2(21) - \\log_2(2)$.\nSince $2^4 = 16$ and $2^0 = 1$, $\\log_2(21) = \\log_2(2^4 \\cdot 1.75) = 4 + \\log_2(1.75)$.\nSince $1.75 \\approx 2$, $\\log_2(1.75) \\approx \\log_2(2)$.\nTherefore, $x = 4 + \\log_2(1.75) - \\log_2(2) \\approx 4$.\nThe answer is: 4",
        "We can rewrite $42$ as $2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7$.\nSo, we have $2^{x+2} = 2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7$.\nUsing the properties of exponents, we can set the exponents equal to each other: $x+2 = 2 + \\log_2 3 + \\log_2 7$.\nSimplifying, we have $x = \\log_2 18$.\nSince $18 = 2 \\cdot 3^2$, we have $\\log_2 18 = \\log_2 (2 \\cdot 3^2) = \\log_2 2 + \\log_2 3^2 = 1 + 2\\log_2 3$.\nThus, $x = 1 + 2\\log_2 3$.\nTherefore, the value of $x$ is $\\boxed{1 + 2\\log_2 3}$.The answer is: 1+2\\log_23",
        "We can rewrite the equation as $2^x \\cdot 2^2 = 42$.\nSimplifying, we have $2^x \\cdot 4 = 42$.\nDividing both sides by 4, we get $2^x = 10.5$.\nSince $2^x$ is an integer, the only possible value for $x$ is $x = \\boxed{4}$.\nThe answer is: 4",
        "We can rewrite $42$ as $2^2 \\cdot 7$.\nSo, we have $2^{x+2} = 2^2 \\cdot 7$.\nBy comparing the exponents, we get $x+2 = 2+1$.\nSimplifying, we find $x = 1$.\nTherefore, the integer $x$ that satisfies the equation is $\\boxed{1}$.The answer is: 1",
        "First, we can simplify the equation by taking the logarithm base 2 of both sides. This gives us $x+2 = \\log_2 42$.\nNext, we can use the property of logarithms that $\\log_b a^n = n \\log_b a$ to rewrite the equation as $x+2 = \\log_2 (2^2 \\cdot 3)$.\nWe know that $\\log_b b^n = n$, so we can simplify the equation further to $x+2 = 2+ \\log_2 3$.\nFinally, we can solve for $x$ by subtracting 2 from both sides, giving us $x = \\log_2 3$.\nSince $\\log_2 3$ is an irrational number, there is no integer value of $x$ that satisfies the equation.\nTherefore, there is no integer $x$ that satisfies the equation $2^{x+2} = 42$.The answer is: 42",
        "We can rewrite $42$ as $2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7$.\nSo, we have $2^{x + 2} = 2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7$.\nCanceling out the common factors on both sides, we get $2^x = 3 \\cdot 7$.\nSince $2^x$ is a power of $2$, it cannot equal $3 \\cdot 7$ because $3 \\cdot 7$ does not have a power of $2$ as a factor.\nTherefore, there is no integer $x$ that satisfies the equation.The answer is: 2",

        "First, we can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by $2^2$ to get $2^{x} = 21$.\nSince $21$ is equal to $3 \\times 7$, we can rewrite the equation as $2^{x} = 3 \\times 7$.\nWith the exponent rule $a^{bc} = (a^{b})^{c}$, we can rewrite the equation as $(2^1)^{x} = 3 \\times 7$.\nThis simplifies to $2^{x} = 3 \\times 7$.\nSince $2^x = 14$, we have $14 = 2^x$.\nTaking the logarithm base $2$ of both sides gives us $\\log_2 14 = \\log_2 (2^x)$, or $\\log_2 14 = x$.\nUsing the property of logarithms that $\\log_b (a^b) = b$, we have $\\log_2 14 = \\log_2 2^x$.\nTherefore, $x = \\boxed{3}$.\nThe answer is: 3",

        "First, we can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by $2^2$ (since $2^2=4$).\nThis gives us $2^x=21$.\nSince $21$ is a power of $2$, we know that $2^x=21$ when $x=\\boxed{4}$.\nThe answer is: 4",
        "First, we simplify the equation by dividing both sides by 2:\n$2^{x + 2} / 2 = 42 / 2$.\nThis simplifies to $2^x = 21$.\nSince $21 = 2^x$, we can rewrite this as $x = \\log_2 21$.\nUsing the change of base formula, $\\log_b a = \\frac{\\log_c a}{\\log_c b}$,\nwe can rewrite this as $x = \\frac{\\log 21}{\\log 2}$.\nUsing the properties of logarithms, we can rewrite this as $x = \\log_{10} 21 / \\log_{10} 2$.\nFinally, using the definition of common logarithms, we can evaluate this expression as $x = \\frac{\\log 21}{\\log 2}$.\nUsing a calculator, we find that $x \\approx \\boxed{4.415}$.\nThe answer is: 4.415",
        "We can rewrite $42$ as $2^2 \\times 3 \\times 7$.\nTherefore, we have $2^{x + 2} = 2^2 \\times 3 \\times 7$.\nUsing the property of exponents, we can rewrite the equation as $2^x \\times 2^2 = 2^2 \\times 3 \\times 7$.\nSimplifying, we have $2^x \\times 4 = 2^2 \\times 3 \\times 7$.\nCancelling out the common factors of $2^2$ on both sides, we have $2^x \\times 2 = 3 \\times 7$.\nSimplifying further, we have $2^{x + 1} = 21$.\nSince $21$ is equal to $3 \\times 7$, we have $x + 1 = 2$.\nSolving for $x$, we have $x = 2 - 1$.\nTherefore, the value of $x$ that satisfies the equation is $\\boxed{1}$.The answer is: 1",
