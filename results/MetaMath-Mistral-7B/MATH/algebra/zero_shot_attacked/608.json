        "Let $y = \\sqrt{x + \\sqrt{x + \\sqrt{x + \\ldots}}}$. Then $y = \\sqrt{x + y}$.\nSquaring both sides, we get $y^2 = x + y$. Rearranging, we have $y^2 - y - x = 0$.\nBy the quadratic formula, $y = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 4x}}{2}$. Since $y$ must be nonnegative, we take $y = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{1 + 4x}}{2}$.\nSubstituting back in, we have $\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{1 + 4x}}{2} = 7$.\nSolving for $x$, we get $x = \\boxed{36}$.The answer is: 36",
