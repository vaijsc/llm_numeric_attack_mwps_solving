        "We can factor the expression as a perfect square trinomial: $a^2+8a-7=(a+4)^2-21$.\nSince $(a+4)^2$ is always nonnegative, the minimum value of the expression occurs when $(a+4)^2=0$, which is when $a=-4$.\nEvaluating the expression at $a=-4$, we find that the minimum value is $(-4+4)^2-21=0-21=\\boxed{-21}$.\nThe answer is: -21",
        "To find the minimum value of a quadratic function, we can rewrite the quadratic in vertex form.\nThe vertex form of a quadratic is $y=a(x-h)^2+k$, where $(h,k)$ is the vertex of the parabola.\nIn this case, the quadratic is $a^2+8a-7$.\nCompleting the square, we have $(a+4)^2-7-4=a^2+8a-7$.\nTherefore, the minimum value of $a^2+8a-7$ is $(-4)^2-7-4=\\boxed{-11}$.\nThe answer is: -11",
        "The given expression is a quadratic function of $a$, which represents a parabola when graphed.\nTo find the minimum value of the quadratic function, we need to find the vertex of the parabola.\nThe vertex of a parabola in the form $y=a(x-h)^2+k$ is given by the point $(h,k)$.\nIn this case, the quadratic function is $a^2+8a-7$, so the vertex is $(h,k)=(-2,1)$.\nTherefore, the minimum value of the quadratic function is $1$.\nThe answer is: 1",
        "We can rewrite the quadratic as $a^2+8a-7$.\nTo find the minimum value, we need to find the vertex of the parabola defined by this quadratic.\nThe x-coordinate of the vertex can be found using the formula $x=-\\frac{b}{2a}$, where $a$ is the coefficient of $a^2$ and $b$ is the coefficient of $a$.\nIn this case, $a=1$ and $b=8$, so $x=-\\frac{8}{2(1)}=-4$.\nTo find the y-coordinate of the vertex, we can substitute $x=-4$ into the quadratic formula.\n$a^2+8a-7=(-4)^2+8(-4)-7=16-32-7=-19$.\nTherefore, the minimum value of $a^2+8a-7$ is $\\boxed{-19}$.\nThe answer is: -19",
        "We can complete the square by adding $(8/2)^2=16$ to the expression.\nThis gives us $a^2 + 8a - 7 + 16$, which simplifies to $(a + 4)^2 + 9$.\nSince $(a + 4)^2$ is always nonnegative, the minimum value of $(a + 4)^2 + 9$ is $\\boxed{9}$.\nThe answer is: 9",
        "We can rewrite the expression as $(a^2+8a)-7$.\nNext, we complete the square by adding $(8/2)^2=16$ inside the parentheses:\n$(a^2+8a+16)-7-16=(a+4)^2-23$.\nSince $(a+4)^2$ is always non-negative, the minimum value of the expression is $\\boxed{-23}$.\nThe answer is: -23",
        "To find the minimum value of the expression, we can complete the square.\nWe rewrite the expression as $a^2+8a+16-16-7$.\nThis can be rearranged as $(a+4)^2-21$.\nSince $(a+4)^2$ is always nonnegative, the minimum value of the expression occurs when $(a+4)^2=0$.\nThis happens when $a=-4$.\nSo, the minimum value of the expression is $(-4+4)^2-21=-21$.\nTherefore, the minimum value of $a^2+8a-7$ is $\\boxed{-21}$.The answer is: -21",
        "We can rewrite the expression as $(a+4)^2 - 17$ using the square of a binomial.\nSince $(a+4)^2$ is always nonnegative, the minimum value occurs when $(a+4)^2 = 0$, which means $a = -4$.\nPlugging $a = -4$ back into the expression, we get $(-4+4)^2 - 17 = -17$.\nTherefore, the minimum value of $a^2+8a-7$ is $\\boxed{-17}$.The answer is: -17",
        "We can rewrite the expression as $(a + 4)(a - 1)$.\nSince $(a + 4)$ is always nonnegative and $(a - 1)$ is always nonpositive, the minimum value of the expression occurs when $(a + 4)$ is 0 and $(a - 1)$ is -1, which is when $a = -3$.\nTherefore, the minimum value of $a^2 + 8a - 7$ is $-3^2 + 8(-3) - 7 = \\boxed{-17}$.\nThe answer is: -17",
        "We can complete the square to find the minimum value of $a^2+8a-7$.\nFirst, we add $(8/2)^2=16$ to both sides: $a^2+8a-7+16=(a+4)^2$.\nSo, the minimum value of $a^2+8a-7$ is $(a+4)^2$, which occurs when $a=-4$.\nPlugging in $a=-4$ into the expression $a^2+8a-7$, we get $(-4)^2+8(-4)-7=16-32-7=\\boxed{-15}$.\nThe answer is: -15",
        "We can rewrite the expression as $(a+4)^2 - 17$.\nSince $(a+4)^2$ is always nonnegative, the minimum value occurs when $(a+4)^2=0$.\nThis happens when $a+4=0$, so the minimum value is $\\boxed{-17}$.\nThe answer is: -17",
        "We can complete the square for the quadratic expression $a^2+8a-7$. \nWe add $(8/2)^2=16$ inside the parentheses, and add and subtract the same value outside the parentheses. \nThe expression becomes $a^2+8a-7+16-16$. \nWe can factor the quadratic expression as a perfect square trinomial: $(a+4)^2-9$. \nSince $(a+4)^2$ is always nonnegative, the minimum value of the expression occurs when $(a+4)^2$ is minimized. \nThe minimum value of $(a+4)^2$ is $0$, which occurs when $a=-4$. \nTherefore, the minimum value of the expression $a^2+8a-7$ is $0-9=\\boxed{-9}$. \nThe answer is: -9",
        "We can rewrite the expression as $(a+4)^2-17$.\nSince $(a+4)^2$ is always nonnegative, the minimum value occurs when it is equal to zero, which is when $a=-4$.\nSo the minimum value of $a^2+8a-7$ is $(-4+4)^2-17 = \\boxed{-17}$.\nThe answer is: -17",
        "We can rewrite the expression as $(a+4)(a-1)$ using factoring.\nSince $a+4 \\geq 0$ and $a-1 \\leq 0$, the minimum value of the expression occurs when $a+4=0$ and $a-1=0$.\nTherefore, the minimum value of $a^2+8a-7$ is $(0)(-1) = \\boxed{-7}$.The answer is: -7",
        "First, we factor the quadratic expression: $a^2+8a-7=(a+7)(a-1)$.\nTo find the minimum value, we need to find the vertex of the parabola represented by this expression.\nThe x-coordinate of the vertex is given by $-\\frac{b}{2a}=-\\frac{8}{2}=-4$.\nTo find the y-coordinate of the vertex, we substitute $x=-4$ into the expression: $y=(-4)^2+8(-4)-7=16-32-7=-11$.\nTherefore, the vertex of the parabola is $(-4,-11)$.\nSince the parabola opens upward (the coefficient of $a^2$ is positive), the minimum value occurs at the vertex.\nSo, the minimum value of $a^2+8a-7$ is $\\boxed{-11}$.The answer is: -11"
