        "To find the y-intercept, we need to find the value of $Q(x)$ when $x=0$.\nSince $P(x)$ is a 3rd degree polynomial, it means the graph of $P(x)$ passes through three points.\nTo find these points, we set $P(x) = 0$ and solve for $x$.\n$4x^3 - 2x^2 + 7x - 2 = 0$\nThis is a difficult equation to solve, so we can use synthetic division to find the roots.\nUsing synthetic division, we find the roots to be $x = 1, 1, 2$.\nTherefore, the three points that the graph of $P(x)$ passes through are $(1, 0)$, $(1, 0)$, $(2, 0)$.\nSince $Q(x) = P(x)^2$, the graph of $Q(x)$ will pass through these three points as well.\nTherefore, when $x=0$, $Q(x) = P(0)^2 = (0)^2 = 0$.\nSo the y-intercept of $Q(x)$ is $\\boxed{0}$.The answer is: 0",
