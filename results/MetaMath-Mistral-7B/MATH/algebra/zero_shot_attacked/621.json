        "perfect square, and let the smaller perfect square be $n^2$. \nThen we have the equation $n^2 + (n+1)^2 = 49$. \nWe can simplify this equation as follows: \n$n^2 + 2n + 1 + n^2 = 49$ \n$2n^2 + 2n - 48 = 0$ \n$n^2 + n - 24 = 0$ \nFactoring, we have: \n$(n-4)(n+6) = 0$ \nTherefore, $n-4 = 0$ or $n+6 = 0$. \nIf $n-4 = 0$, then $n = 4$. \nIf $n+6 = 0$, then $n = -6$ (which is not a positive integer). \nSince $n$ represents a positive integer, the smaller perfect square is $4^2 = 16$. \nTherefore, the greater perfect square is $n^2 = (n+1)^2 - 1 = 16+1 = 17$. \nThe answer is: 17",
