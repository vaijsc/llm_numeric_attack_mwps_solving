        "Let $x$ be the weight of each of the two smaller dogs.\nThen the weight of the larger dog is $x + 30$.\nThe combined weight of all three dogs is $2x + (x + 30) = 3x + 30$.\nWe are given that the combined weight is $193$ pounds, so $3x + 30 = 193$.\nSolving for $x$, we have $3x = 163$ and $x = 54$.\nTherefore, the weight of the largest dog is $x + 30 = 54 + 30 = \\boxed{84}$ pounds.\nThe answer is: 84",
        "Let $x$ be the weight of each of the smaller dogs, so the combined weight of the two smaller dogs is $2x$.\nThe weight of the larger dog is $193 - 2x$.\nThe difference between the weight of the larger dog and the combined weight of the smaller dogs is $30$, so we can write the equation:\n$193 - 2x = 2x + 30$\nSimplifying and solving for $x$:\n$193 = 4x + 30$\n$163 = 4x$\n$x = 41$\nSo each of the smaller dogs weighs $41$ pounds and the larger dog weighs $193 - 2(41) = \\boxed{81}$ pounds.\nThe answer is: 81",
        "Let's call the weight of the larger dog $x$ pounds.\nSince the two smaller dogs weigh the same, we'll call their weight $y$ pounds each.\nAccording to the problem, we have the following equations:\n$x + 2y = 193$ (equation 1)\n$x - y = 30$ (equation 2)\nWe can solve these equations to find the values of $x$ and $y$.\nWe can solve equation 2 for $y$ to get $y = x - 30$.\nSubstituting this value of $y$ into equation 1, we get $x + 2(x - 30) = 193$.\nSimplifying, we get $2x - 60 = 193$.\nAdding 60 to both sides, we get $2x = 253$.\nDividing by 2, we find $x = 126.5$.\nSince the weight of the dogs must be a whole number, we round down to $126$ pounds.\nTherefore, the largest dog weighs $\\boxed{126}$ pounds.\nThe answer is: 126",
        "Let $x$ be the weight of each of the smaller dogs, and let $y$ be the weight of the larger dog.\nWe are given two pieces of information: $x + x + y = 193$ and $y - x = 30$.\nWe can simplify the first equation to $2x + y = 193$.\nWe can then substitute $y = 30 + x$ into the first equation to get $2x + 30 + x = 193$.\nCombining like terms, we have $3x + 30 = 193$.\nSubtracting 30 from both sides, we get $3x = 163$.\nDividing both sides by 3, we find that $x = 54$.\nSince $y = 30 + x$, we have $y = 30 + 54 = 84$.\nTherefore, the largest dog weighs $\\boxed{84}$ pounds.\nThe answer is: 84",
        "Let $x$ be the weight of each of the smaller dogs. The combined weight of the three dogs is then $x+x+2x=4x$.\nWe know that the difference between the larger weight and the smaller weight is $30$ pounds, so the larger weight must be $x+30$.\nThe combined weight of the three dogs is $193$ pounds, so we have the equation $4x=193$.\nSolving for $x$, we find $x=48.25$.\nTherefore, the weight of the largest dog is $x+30=\\boxed{78.25}$ pounds.\nThe answer is: 78.25",

We can multiply the second equation by 2 to get $2l - 2s = 60$.\nAdding this equation to the first equation, we get $2l - 2s + l + 2s = 193 + 60$, or $3l = 253$.\nDividing both sides by 3, we find that $l = 84$.\nTherefore, the largest dog weighs $\\boxed{84}$ pounds.The answer is: 84",
