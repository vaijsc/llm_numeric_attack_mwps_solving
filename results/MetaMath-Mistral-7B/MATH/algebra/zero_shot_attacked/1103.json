        "(x-4)^2$ represents the distance between x and 4 on the number line. When $(x-4)^2$ is less than or equal to 8, it means that the distance between x and 4 is less than or equal to the square root of 8. In other words, the segment of the number line satisfies $x \\in [4-\\sqrt{8}, 4+\\sqrt{8}]$. Simplifying, we have $x \\in [4-\\sqrt{8}, 4+\\sqrt{8}] = [4-2\\sqrt{2}, 4+2\\sqrt{2}]$. Therefore, the length of the segment is $(4+2\\sqrt{2}) - (4-2\\sqrt{2}) = 4+2\\sqrt{2} - 4+2\\sqrt{2} = 2\\cdot2 = \\boxed{4}$.The answer is: 4",
        "First, let's take the square root of both sides of the inequality: $\\sqrt{(x-4)^2} \\le \\sqrt{8}$.\nSince the square root function is non-negative, we can drop the square roots and simplify the inequality to $-4 \\le x-4 \\le 2\\sqrt{2}$.\nNext, let's add 4 to both sides of the inequalities:\n$-4 + 4 \\le x-4 + 4 \\le 2\\sqrt{2} + 4$.\nThis simplifies to $-4 \\le x \\le 2\\sqrt{2} + 4$.\nFinally, let's solve for x:\n$-4 \\le x \\le 2\\sqrt{2} + 4$.\nThe length of the segment is the difference between the two endpoints, which is $2\\sqrt{2} + 4 - (-4)$.\nSimplifying, we get $2\\sqrt{2} + 8$.\nTherefore, the length of the segment is $\\boxed{2\\sqrt{2} + 8}$.The answer is: 8",
        "a number, we can take the square root of both sides of the inequality. Since the square root of a number can be positive or negative, we need to consider both cases.\nCase 1: Taking the square root of (x-4)^2:\nsqrt((x-4)^2) <= sqrt(8)\n|x-4| <= sqrt(8)\nThis means that the distance between x and 4 is less than or equal to sqrt(8). In other words, x must be within 4 +/- sqrt(8) of 4.\nCase 2: Negating the inequality and taking the square root of (x-4)^2:\n-(x-4)^2 <= -8\nThis simplifies to:\n-(x^2 - 8x + 16) <= -8\n-x^2 + 8x - 16 <= -8\nRearranging the terms and dividing by -1, we get:\nx^2 - 8x + 24 >= 8\n(x-4)^2 >= 8\nThis means that the distance between x and 4 must be greater than or equal to sqrt(8). In other words, x must be outside 4 +/- sqrt(8) of 4.\nCombining both cases, we can see that the segment of the number line that satisfies (x-4)^2 <= 8 is the closed interval [4 - sqrt(8), 4 + sqrt(8)].\nTherefore, the length of this segment is (4 + sqrt(8) - (4 - sqrt(8))) = 2*sqrt(8) = 2 * sqrt(2^3) = 2 * 2 * sqrt(2) = 4 * sqrt(2) = boxed{4\\sqrt{2}}.The answer is: 4\\sqrt{2}",
