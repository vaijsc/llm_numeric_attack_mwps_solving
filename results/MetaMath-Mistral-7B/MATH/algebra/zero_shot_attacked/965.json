        "If two prime numbers are the roots of the equation $x^2-22x+k=0$, then their sum is $22$ and their product is $k$.\nThe two prime numbers must be $3$ and $19$ (since $3+19=22$ and $3\\cdot19=57$), so $k=3\\cdot19=\\boxed{57}$.\nThe answer is: 57",
        "The product of the roots of the quadratic equation $x^2-22x+k=0$ is equal to the constant term, $k$.\nSince the two prime numbers are the roots, we know that their product is positive.\nTherefore, $k$ must be positive as well.\nThe two prime numbers are roots of the equation, so they must satisfy the equation.\nSubstituting the first prime number into the equation, we get $(p_1)^2-22(p_1)+k=0$, which simplifies to $p_1^2-22p_1+k=0$.\nSince $p_1$ is prime, it cannot be a factor of 22, so $p_1$ must be a factor of $k$.\nSubstituting the second prime number into the equation, we get $(p_2)^2-22(p_2)+k=0$, which simplifies to $p_2^2-22p_2+k=0$.\nSimilarly, $p_2$ must be a factor of $k$.\nSince $p_1$ and $p_2$ are prime and $k$ is positive, the only possible factorization of $k$ is $k=p_1 \\cdot p_2$.\nTherefore, $k$ must be equal to the product of the two prime numbers, $k=\\boxed{239}$.\nThe answer is: 239",
        "Since the two prime numbers are roots of the equation, they must be the factors of the constant term $k$.\nThe prime numbers are 2 and 11, so the possible values of $k$ are 2 and 11.\nHowever, we know that $k$ must be equal to the difference of the squares of the roots, which is $22^2=484$.\nTherefore, the value of $k$ is $\\boxed{484}$.\nThe answer is: 484",
        "We can factor the quadratic as $(x-p)(x-q)=0$, where $p$ and $q$ are the prime numbers. \nThis means that the solutions to the equation are $x=p$ and $x=q$. \nSince the sum of the roots of a quadratic equation of the form $ax^2+bx+c=0$ is equal to $-b/a$, we have $p+q=22$. \nThe product of the roots is equal to $c/a$, so $pq=k$. \nSince $p$ and $q$ are primes, the only possible values for $p$ and $q$ are 2 and 11 (in some order). \nThus, the value of $k$ is $pq=2\\cdot 11=\\boxed{22}$.The answer is: 22",
        "\nIf two prime numbers are roots of the equation, then there must exist two numbers $a$ and $b$ such that $(x-a)(x-b)=x^2-(a+b)x+ab=x^2-22x+k$.\nComparing coefficients, we have $a+b=22$ and $ab=k$.\nWe know that $a$ and $b$ are prime numbers, so the only possible values for $(a,b)$ are $(11,11)$ and $(2,22)$.\nHowever, the sum of the roots $a+b$ in the case of $(2,22)$ is $2+22=24$, which is not equal to $22$.\nTherefore, the only possible solution is $(a,b)=(11,11)$, which implies $ab=11\\cdot11=k$.\nSo the value of $k$ is $\\boxed{121}$.\nThe answer is: 121",
        "The equation $x^2-22x+k=0$ can be factored as $(x-p_1)(x-p_2)=0$,\nwhere $p_1$ and $p_2$ are the two prime roots.\nExpanding the left side, we have $x^2-p_1x-p_2x+p_1p_2=0$.\nComparing this with the given equation, we see that $p_1p_2=k$.\nSince $p_1$ and $p_2$ are prime, their product must be even,\nbut the only even prime number is 2.\nTherefore, $p_1p_2=2$, so $k=\\boxed{2}$.\nThe answer is: 2",
        "Since the two prime numbers are roots of the equation, we know that the equation can be factored as $(x-p)(x-q)=0$, where $p$ and $q$ are the two prime numbers.\nExpanding the left side of the equation, we get $x^2 - (p+q)x + pq = 0$.\nWe are given that the equation is $x^2-22x+k=0$, so we can set $p+q = 22$ and $pq = k$.\nSince $p$ and $q$ are prime numbers, one of them must be 2.\nIf $p=2$, then $q=20$, and $pq = 2*20 = 40$.\nIf $p=3$, then $q=19$, and $pq = 3*19 = 57$.\nSince $k$ can only be 40 or 57, the value of $k$ is $\\boxed{57}$.\nThe answer is: 57",
        "Since the two prime numbers are positive, their sum, $22$, must be even.\nThe only even prime number is $2$, so one of the roots of the equation must be $2$.\nThe other root must be odd, so it must be $11$.\nTherefore, the equation can be factored as $(x-2)(x-11)=0$.\nExpanding, we get $x^2-13x+22=0$.\nComparing this with the original equation, we see that $k=\\boxed{22}$.\nThe answer is: 22",
        "The sum of the roots of a quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ is given by $-\\frac{b}{a}$,\nand the product of the roots is given by $\\frac{c}{a}$.\nIn this case, the sum of the roots is $22$ and the product of the roots is $k$.\nSince the roots are prime numbers, there are only two possibilities for the two prime roots: $3$ and $19$, and $5$ and $17$.\nFor the first possibility, the sum and the product are both $3 \\cdot 19 = 57$.\nFor the second possibility, the sum and the product are both $5 \\cdot 17 = 85$.\nTherefore, the only possible value for $k$ is $\\boxed{85}$.\nThe answer is: 85",
        "The quadratic equation $x^2-22x+k=0$ has two prime numbers as roots.\nSince the coefficient of the $x^2$ term is 1, the sum of the roots is $22$.\nThe only way for the sum of two prime numbers to be $22$ is if one prime number is $2$ and the other prime number is $21$.\nTherefore, the equation becomes $(x-2)(x-21)=0$.\nExpanding, we get $x^2-23x+420=0$.\nComparing this to the original equation, we find that $k=\\boxed{420}$.\nThe answer is: 420",
        "The sum of the roots of a quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ is $-b/a$,\nand the product of the roots is $c/a$.\nIn this case, the sum of the roots is $22$\nand the product of the roots is $k$.\nSince the roots are prime numbers, the only possible values for the roots are $2$ and $11$.\nTherefore, the product of the roots is $2\\times11=22$,\nwhich means $k=\\boxed{22}$.\nThe answer is: 22",
        "The equation has two roots, which are prime numbers.\nThe sum of the roots is $22$, so the possible prime numbers that add up to $22$ are $2$ and $20$.\nHowever, $20$ is not a prime number, so the only possible pair of roots is $2$ and $11$.\nWe can now use the sum of roots and product of roots formulas to solve for $k$.\nThe sum of roots is $2+11=13$ and the product of roots is $2\\cdot11=22$.\nUsing the sum of roots formula, we have $13=\\frac{x_1+x_2}{x_1x_2}$.\nSubstituting $k$ for $x_1 x_2$, we get $13=\\frac{22}{k}$.\nSimplifying, we find $k=\\boxed{22}$.\nThe answer is: 22",
        "the equation $x^2-22x+k=0$.\nBy Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots is $22$, so the two prime numbers must be $11$ and $13$ (since they are positive and their sum is $22$).\nTherefore, the value of $k$ is equal to the product of the roots, which is $11\\times 13 = \\boxed{143}$.The answer is: 143",
        "Since the coefficients of the quadratic are all integers, the other two roots must also be integers.\nSince the sum of the roots of the quadratic is $22$, and the sum of the prime roots is $11+13=24$, one of the roots must be $24-11=13$.\nSo, the other root must be $22-13=9$.\nSince $9$ and $13$ are prime, the other two roots are $9$ and $13$.\nUsing Vieta\u2019s formulas, the sum of the roots is $9+13=22$, and the product of the roots is $9\\times13=117$.\nTherefore, the value of $k$ is $\\boxed{117}$.\nThe answer is: 117",
        "We can factor the equation as $(x-p_1)(x-p_2)=0$,\nwhere $p_1$ and $p_2$ are the prime roots.\nExpanding, we have $x^2-(p_1+p_2)x+p_1p_2=0$.\nComparing this to the given equation $x^2-22x+k=0$,\nwe see that $p_1+p_2=22$ and $p_1p_2=k$.\nSince $p_1$ and $p_2$ are primes, the only possible values are $p_1=11$ and $p_2=11$,\nwhich gives us $p_1p_2=k=11\\cdot 11=\\boxed{121}$.\nThe answer is: 121"
