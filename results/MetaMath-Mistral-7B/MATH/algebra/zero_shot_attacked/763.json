        "The equation simplifies to $\\frac{2x+1}{x-1} = 6$.\nWe can multiply both sides by $x-1$ to get rid of the fraction, giving $2x+1 = 6(x-1)$.\nSimplifying, we have $2x+1 = 6x-6$.\nSubtracting $2x$ and adding 6 to both sides, we get $7 = 4x$.\nDividing both sides by 4, we find $x = \\frac{7}{4}$.\nHowever, when we substitute this value back into the original equation, we get $\\frac{1}{\\frac{7}{4}-1} + \\frac{2\\cdot\\frac{7}{4}}{\\frac{7}{4}-1} \\neq 6$.\nTherefore, the value $x = \\frac{7}{4}$ is not a valid solution.\nHence, there are no solutions to the given equation.The answer is: 4",
