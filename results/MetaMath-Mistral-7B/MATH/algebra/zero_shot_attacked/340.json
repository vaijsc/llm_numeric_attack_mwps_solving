        " suggests that $h(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $5$ and $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $b$.\nWe can find the degree of $h(x)$ by multiplying the leading terms of $x^5-7x+10$ and $g(x)$ together. Since $x^5$ is the leading term of $x^5-7x+10$, the degree of $h(x)$ is $5$.\nTherefore, the degree of $g(x)$ is $5-b$ because $h(x) = (x^5-7x+10) \\cdot g(x)$. This means that $5-b$ is equal to $b$, so $2b = 5$ and $b = \\boxed{5/2}$.The answer is: \\frac{5}{2}",
        "The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of $x$ that appears in the polynomial.\nIf $h(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $5$, then the highest power of $x$ in $h(x)$ is $x^5$.\nSince $h(x) = (x^5-7x+10) \\cdot g(x)$, the degree of $g(x)$ must be less than or equal to $5$ in order for the product to have a degree of $5$.\nIf the degree of $g(x)$ were greater than $5$, then the highest power of $x$ in the product would be greater than $x^5$.\nTherefore, the degree of $g(x)$ must be $\\boxed{5}$.\nThe answer is: 5",
        "If $h(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 5, then the term with the highest degree in $h(x)$ is $x^5$.\nSince $h(x) = (x^5-7x+10) \\cdot g(x)$, there must be a term $x^5$ in $g(x)$ for the product to have a term $x^5$ in $h(x)$.\nTherefore, the degree of $g(x)$ must be 5, so $b = \\boxed{5}$.\nThe answer is: 5",
        "If $h(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 5, then the degree of $g(x)$ must be 5 as well in order for the product $(x^5-7x+10) \\cdot g(x)$ to have a degree of 5.\nTherefore, the value of $b$ is $\\boxed{5}$.The answer is: 5",
        "s of the polynomial $h(x)$ must be the same as the roots of the polynomial $(x^5 - 7x + 10) \\cdot g(x)$. \nSince $h(x)$ has degree 5, it must have 5 distinct roots. Therefore, the polynomial $(x^5 - 7x + 10)$ must have 5 distinct roots, which means $g(x) = \\frac{1}{(x^5 - 7x + 10)}$. \nTo find the degree of $g(x)$, we need to determine the degree of the denominator. The degree of the denominator is equal to the degree of the polynomial divided by the greatest common divisor of the coefficients of the polynomial. In this case, the degree of the denominator is 5/1 = 5. \nTherefore, the degree of $g(x)$ is 5, and $b = \\boxed{5}$.The answer is: 5",
        "The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of the variable that appears in the polynomial.\nSince $h(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $5$, the term with the highest power of $x$ in $h(x)$ is $(x^5)$.\nWe can write $h(x)$ as $(x^5-7x+10) \\cdot g(x)$, where $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $b$.\nThis means that the term with the highest power of $x$ in $h(x)$ comes from either $x^5$ or $g(x)$.\nSince $h(x)$ has a term with $x^5$, we know that the highest power of $x$ in $g(x)$ is less than or equal to $5$.\nTherefore, the degree of $g(x)$ is at most $5$.\nTo find the degree of $g(x)$, we can compare the highest power of $x$ in $h(x)$ to the highest power of $x$ in $g(x)$.\nSince $(x^5-7x+10)$ does not have any terms with powers of $x$ less than $5$, the highest power of $x$ in $g(x)$ must be $5$.\nTherefore, the degree of $g(x)$ is $5$, so $b=\\boxed{5}$.\nThe answer is: 5",

        "The degree of $h(x)$ is $5$, so the degree of $g(x)$ must be $5 - b$.\nSince $h(x) = (x^5-7x+10) \\cdot g(x)$, we know that the degree of $h(x)$ is the sum of the degrees of $(x^5-7x+10)$ and $g(x)$.\nTherefore, $5 = (5-b) + b$ simplified to $5 = 5$.\nThis implies that $b = \\boxed{0}$.\nThe answer is: 0",

        "The degree of $h(x)$ is $5$, so the degree of $g(x)$ must be $5 - 1 = 4$.\nThis is because when we multiply $(x^5-7x+10)$ by $g(x)$, it will result in a polynomial of degree $5$ if $g(x)$ has a degree of $4$.\nTherefore, the value of $b$ is $\\boxed{4}$.The answer is: 4",
