        "We want to maximize the area of the garden.\nThe area of a rectangle is given by the formula $A = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width}$.\nSince we have a fixed amount of fencing, let\u2019s represent the length as $l$ and the width as $w$.\nThe perimeter of the rectangle is given by $2l + 2w$.\nWe are given that $2l + 2w = 250$, since the fencing must entirely enclose the garden.\nSimplifying, we have $l + w = 125$.\nWe want to maximize the area, which is given by $A = lw$.\nTo do this, we can use the AM-GM inequality.\nAccording to the AM-GM inequality, the arithmetic mean of a set of non-negative numbers is greater than or equal to the geometric mean.\nIn this case, let\u2019s take the arithmetic mean and geometric mean of $l$ and $w$.\nThe arithmetic mean of $l$ and $w$ is $(l + w)/2$.\nThe geometric mean of $l$ and $w$ is $\\sqrt{lw}$.\nAccording to the AM-GM inequality, $(l + w)/2 \\ge \\sqrt{lw}$.\nWe can rearrange this inequality to get $lw \\le (l + w)^2/4$.\nSince $l + w = 125$, we have $lw \\le 125^2/4$.\nTo maximize the area, we want to find the maximum value of $lw$ that satisfies this inequality.\nSo, we want to maximize $lw$ while keeping $l + w = 125$.\nTo do this, we can use the AM-GM inequality again.\nLet $x = l$ and $y = w$.\nThen, we have $lw = xy$.\nAccording to the AM-GM inequality, $xy \\le (x + y)^2/4$.\nSince $x + y = 125$, we have $lw \\le 125^2/4 = 625/4$.\nTherefore, the maximum area of the garden is $A = \\boxed{625}$.The answer is: 62",
        "Let $l$ be the length and $w$ be the width of the rectangular garden.\nWe know that the perimeter of the garden is 250 feet, so we have the equation $2l + 2w = 250$.\nSimplifying, we get $l + w = 125$.\nWe want to maximize the area of the garden, which is given by $A = lw$.\nWe can rewrite this equation as $l = 125 - w$ and substitute it into the area equation.\n$A = (125 - w)w$\nTo find the maximum value of $A$, we can take the derivative of $A$ with respect to $w$ and set it equal to 0.\n$\\frac{dA}{dw} = 125 - 2w = 0$\nSolving for $w$, we get $w = 62.5$.\nSubstituting this value back into the equation $l = 125 - w$, we get $l = 62.5$.\nTherefore, the maximum area of the rectangular garden is $A = lw = 62.5 \\times 62.5 = \\boxed{3906.25}$ square feet.\nThe answer is: 3906.25",
        "Let the length of the garden be $l$ and the width be $w$.\nThe perimeter of the garden is $2l + 2w = 250$, or $l + w = 125$.\nWe want to maximize the area, which is given by $A = lw$.\nWe can rewrite $l$ in terms of $w$ as $l = 125 - w$.\nSubstituting into the formula for area, we have $A = (125 - w)w = 125w - w^2$.\nTo find the maximum area, we take the derivative of $A$ with respect to $w$ and set it equal to 0:\n$A' = 125 - 2w = 0$.\nSolving for $w$, we find $w = \\frac{125}{2} = 62.5$.\nSubstituting this value back into the equation for the perimeter, we find $l = 125 - 62.5 = 62.5$.\nTherefore, the dimensions of the garden with the maximum area are $62.5 \\times 62.5$, and the maximum area is $62.5 \\times 62.5 = \\boxed{3906.25}$ square feet.\nThe answer is: 3906.25",
        "Since the fencing must entirely enclose the garden, we can consider the garden as a rectangle.\nLet the length of the rectangle be $l$ and the width be $w$.\nThe perimeter of the rectangle is given by $2l+2w=250$ or $l+w=125$.\nWe want to maximize the area of the rectangle, which is given by $A=lw$.\nFrom the equation $l+w=125$, we can solve for $w$ in terms of $l$ as $w=125-l$.\nSubstituting this into the equation for the area, we have $A=l(125-l)$.\nExpanding, we get $A=125l-l^2$.\nTo find the maximum area, we can take the derivative of this equation with respect to $l$ and set it equal to zero.\n$\\frac{dA}{dl}=125-2l$\nSetting this equal to zero and solving for $l$, we get $l=62.5$.\nSubstituting this back into the equation for the width, we have $w=125-62.5=62.5$.\nTherefore, the maximum area of the rectangle is $lw=62.5\\times 62.5=33^2$.\nSo, the maximum area is $\\boxed{1093.75}$ square feet.\nThe answer is: 1093.75",

        "To maximize the area of the garden, we want to make the length and width as close as possible.\nSince the perimeter is 250 feet, let's split that in half: 250/2 = 125 feet.\nNow we have two sides of the garden, each measuring 125 feet.\nTo maximize the area, we want to maximize the length while still keeping the width at 125 feet.\nLet's try a few possible lengths: 125 feet, 126 feet, 127 feet, and so on.\nWe can see that as the length increases, the area increases as well.\nTherefore, the maximum area occurs when the length is 125 feet and the width is 125 feet.\nThe area is given by the formula length x width, so the maximum area is 125 feet x 125 feet = 15625 square feet.\nThe answer is: 15625",
        "We want to find the maximum area of a rectangular garden using 250 feet of fencing.\nTo maximize the area, we want to maximize the length of the garden while still using 250 feet of fencing.\nSince the fencing must entirely enclose the garden, we can consider splitting it into two equal lengths.\nLet\u2019s say the length of the garden is $l$ feet.\nThen, the width of the garden would be $\\frac{250}{2} = 125$ feet, since we are splitting the fencing into two equal lengths.\nThe area of the garden is given by $A = l \\times w = l \\times 125$.\nTo maximize the area, we want to maximize $l$.\nGiven that the length must be a positive number, the maximum area occurs when $l$ is at its maximum value.\nSo, the maximum area of the garden is $A = l \\times 125 = 250 \\times \\frac{125}{2} = \\boxed{19000}$ square feet.\nThe answer is: 19000",
        "To maximize the area of the garden, we want to make it as square as possible. A square has all sides equal, so each side of the garden will be 250/4 = 62.5 feet long.\nHowever, we can't have a fraction of a foot, so we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, each side of the garden will be 63 feet long.\nThe area of a rectangle is found by multiplying the length by the width. In this case, the length and width are the same, so the area is 63 * 63 = 3969 square feet.\nTherefore, the maximum area of the garden is 3969 square feet.\nThe answer is: 3969",

        "We know that the garden is a rectangle and it is enclosed by 250 feet of fencing. This means that the length of the garden plus the width of the garden must equal 250 feet.\nLet the length of the garden be $l$ and the width of the garden be $w$.\nWe can set up the equation $l+w=250$.\nWe want to maximize the area of the garden, which is given by $A=lw$.\nWe can solve the equation $l+w=250$ for $w$ to get $w=250-l$.\nSubstituting this into the equation $A=lw$, we get $A=l(250-l)$.\nFor the maximum area, we need to find the maximum value of the quadratic function $A=l(250-l)$.\nThe maximum value of a quadratic function occurs at the vertex.\nThe $x$-coordinate of the vertex can be found using the formula $x=-\\frac{b}{2a}$.\nIn this case, $a=-1$ and $b=250$, so $x=-\\frac{250}{2(-1)}=125$.\nSubstituting $x=125$ into the equation $l(250-l)$, we get $125(250-125)=125(125)=15625$.\nTherefore, the maximum area of the garden is $\\boxed{15625}$ square feet.The answer is: 15625",

        "To maximize the area of the garden, we want to make the length and width as close to equal as possible.\nWe can divide the 250 feet of fencing into two equal parts, which gives us 125 feet of fencing for each side of the garden.\nSince the fencing must entirely enclose the garden, we can represent the length and width of the garden as 125 feet.\nThus, the maximum area of the garden is $125 \\times 125 = \\boxed{15625}$ square feet.\nThe answer is: 15625",
