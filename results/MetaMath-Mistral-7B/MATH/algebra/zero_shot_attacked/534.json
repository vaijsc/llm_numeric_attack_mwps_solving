        "Let $x$ be the number of questions Alex answered correctly.\nThen the number of questions he answered incorrectly is $80 - x$, and the number of questions he did not answer is $100 - 80 = 20$.\nHis total score is $7x - 3(80 - x) + 20 \\cdot 0 = 7x - 240 + 3x$.\nWe are given that his total score is $232$, so we have the equation $10x - 240 = 232$.\nSolving for $x$, we get $x = 12$.\nTherefore, Alex answered $\\boxed{12}$ questions correctly.\nThe answer is: 12",
        "\nWe know that Alex answered $80$ questions and scored $232$ points.\nLet $x$ be the number of correct answers and $y$ be the number of incorrect answers.\nAccording to the given information, we can set up two equations:\n$x + y = 80$ (Equation 1)\n$7x - 3y = 232$ (Equation 2)\nWe can solve this system of equations by either substitution or elimination.\nLet's use elimination to solve for $x$ and $y$.\nMultiply Equation 1 by 3:\n$3x + 3y = 240$ (Equation 3)\nAdd Equation 3 to Equation 2:\n$7x - 3y + 3x + 3y = 232 + 240$\n$10x = 472$\nDivide both sides by 10:\n$x = 47.2$\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a question, we know that $x$ must be an integer.\nThe only possible value for $x$ is 47.\nSubstitute $x = 47$ into Equation 1 to solve for $y$:\n$47 + y = 80$\n$y = 80 - 47$\n$y = 33$\nTherefore, Alex answered $47$ questions correctly.The answer is: 47",
        "Let $x$ be the number of questions Alex answered correctly.\nThen $80-x$ is the number of questions he answered incorrectly.\nThe total number of points Alex scored is $7x + (-3)(80-x) = 7x - 240 + 3x = 10x - 240$.\nWe are given that this total is $232$, so we can set up the equation $10x - 240 = 232$ and solve for $x$.\nAdding $240$ to both sides gives $10x = 472$, and dividing both sides by $10$ gives $x = 47.2$.\nSince Alex can't answer a fraction of a question, we round down to the nearest whole number.\nTherefore, Alex answered $\\boxed{47}$ questions correctly.\nThe answer is: 47",
        "Let's say Alex answered $x$ questions correctly.\nSince there are $80$ questions in total, that means he answered $(80-x)$ questions incorrectly and $(80-x)$ questions not answered.\nWe know that each correct answer scores $7$ points, each incorrect answer scores $-3$ points, and each question not answered scores zero points.\nSo, the total number of points scored is $7x + (-3)(80-x) + (0)(80-x)$.\nSimplifying, we get $7x - 240 + 3x = 232$.\nCombining like terms, we have $10x - 240 = 232$.\nAdding $240$ to both sides, we get $10x = 472$.\nDividing both sides by $10$, we find $x = 47.2$.\nHowever, since the number of questions answered correctly must be a whole number, we can conclude that Alex answered $\\boxed{47}$ questions correctly.\nThe answer is: 47",
