        "To find the smallest possible integer value for $x$ such that $f(x)$ has a real number value, we need to determine the range of $f(x)$.\nThe function $f(x) = \\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll}x^2 + x + 1, & x \\leq 0 \\\\ 2x + 1, & x > 0\\end{array}\\right.$ has two different expressions for $x \\leq 0$ and $x > 0$.\nFor $x \\leq 0$, the function is a quadratic function ($x^2 + x + 1$) and has a U-shaped graph that opens upward. This means that the range for $x \\leq 0$ is $(-\\infty, 1]$.\nFor $x > 0$, the function is a linear function ($2x + 1$) and has a V-shaped graph that opens upward. This means that the range for $x > 0$ is $[1, \\infty)$.\nTo find the smallest possible integer value for $x$ such that $f(x)$ has a real number value, we need to find the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to 1, which is 1 itself.\nTherefore, the smallest possible integer value for $x$ is $\\boxed{1}$.The answer is: 1",
        "We want to find the smallest possible integer value for $x$ such that $f(x)$ has a real number value.\nFor $f(x)$ to have a real number value, the denominator of the fraction can't be zero.\nThe denominator is $x^2 + 4x + 13$.\nWe want to find the smallest possible integer value for $x$ such that $x^2 + 4x + 13 \\neq 0$.\nWe can try factoring the quadratic, but it doesn't factor nicely.\nSo, we can use the quadratic formula: $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.\nPlugging in $a=1$, $b=4$, and $c=13$, we get $x = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{4^2 - 4(1)(13)}}{2(1)}$.\nSimplifying, we get $x = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{-32}}{2}$.\nSince $\\sqrt{-32}$ is not a real number, the quadratic has no real solutions.\nThis means that $f(x)$ has a real number value for all integer values of $x$.\nTherefore, the smallest possible integer value for $x$ such that $f(x)$ has a real number value is $\\boxed{-6}$.\nThe answer is: -6",

Since 1 is not zero, we can set 2x + 1 equal to 1 and solve for x:\n2x + 1 = 1\n2x = 0\nx = 0\nTherefore, the smallest possible integer value for x is x = 0.\nThe answer is: 0",

        "To find the values of x for which f(x) is defined, we need to consider the domain of the function.\nSince f(x) is defined as $\\frac{x+2}{x-1}$, the function is defined for all real numbers except where the denominator is equal to zero, which is at x = 1.\nThus, the domain of f(x) is all real numbers except x = 1.\nTo find the smallest possible integer value for x such that f(x) has a real number value, we need to find the smallest integer greater than 1.\nTherefore, the smallest possible integer value for x is \\boxed{2}.\nThe answer is: 2",

Since f(x) = \\sqrt{x^2 - 9}, the expression inside the square root must be greater than or equal to 0.\nTherefore, we need to find the smallest integer value of x such that x^2 - 9 \\geq 0.\nSolving this inequality, we have:\nx^2 \\geq 9\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n|x| \\geq 3\nSince we are looking for the smallest possible integer value of x, we take the smallest integer greater than or equal to 3, which is 3 itself.\nTherefore, the smallest possible integer value of x such that f(x) has a real number value is \\boxed{3}.The answer is: 3",

        "To find the smallest possible integer value for $x$ such that $f(x)$ has a real number value, we need to determine the range of $f(x)$.\nWe can start by examining the expression $f(x) = \\frac{x^2-4}{x+2}$.\nFor $f(x)$ to have a real number value, the denominator $x+2$ must not be equal to zero.\nThis means that $x+2 \\neq 0$, so $x \\neq -2$.\nNext, we can examine the expression $f(x) = \\frac{x^2-4}{x+2}$ when $x$ is equal to $-2$.\nWhen $x = -2$, we have $f(-2) = \\frac{(-2)^2-4}{-2+2} = \\frac{0}{0}$, which is undefined.\nTherefore, the smallest possible integer value for $x$ such that $f(x)$ has a real number value is $\\boxed{-3}$.\nThe answer is: -3",
