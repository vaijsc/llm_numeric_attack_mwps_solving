        "We know that the line $y = -3x + 18$ passes through the point $(x,y)$ if and only if $-3x + 18 = y$.\nSince $y \\geq 0$, we must have $-3x + 18 \\geq 0$.\nSolving this inequality, we find $x \\leq 6$.\nTherefore, the line passes through all lattice points $(x,y)$ such that $1 \\leq x \\leq 6$ and $y = -3x + 18$.\nTo find the number of lattice points, we need to count the number of possible values of $x$.\nThere are 6 possible values of $x$, namely $x = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6$.\nTherefore, the line passes through $\\boxed{6}$ lattice points.\nThe answer is: 6",
