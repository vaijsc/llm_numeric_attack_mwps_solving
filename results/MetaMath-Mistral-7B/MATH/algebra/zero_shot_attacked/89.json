        "We can rewrite the expression as a quadratic function: $f(x) = x^2 - 6x + 13$.\nTo find the minimum value of this quadratic, we can find the vertex.\nThe x-coordinate of the vertex of a quadratic function in the form $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ is given by $x = -\\frac{b}{2a}$.\nIn this case, $a = 1$ and $b = -6$, so the x-coordinate of the vertex is $x = -\\frac{-6}{2(1)} = 3$.\nTo find the y-coordinate of the vertex, we substitute $x = 3$ into the quadratic function: $f(3) = (3)^2 - 6(3) + 13 = 9 - 18 + 13 = 2$.\nThus, the vertex of the quadratic is (3, 2).\nSince the coefficient of the $x^2$ term is positive, the parabola opens upward and the minimum value of the quadratic occurs at the vertex.\nTherefore, the smallest value of the expression is $\\boxed{2}$.\nThe answer is: 2",
        "We can rewrite the expression as $(x-3)^2-4$ by completing the square on $x-3$.\nSince $(x-3)^2$ is always nonnegative, the smallest value the expression can take is $\\boxed{-4}$.The answer is: -4",
        "We can start by factoring the expression $x^2 - 6x + 13$.\nWe see that it can be factored as $(x-3)(x-4)$.\nSince $x$ is an integer, the possible values for $x$ are 3 and 4.\nTherefore, the smallest value of the expression is $(x-3)(x-4) = (3-3)(4-3) = 0$ when $x=3$.\nSo the smallest value of the expression is $\\boxed{0}$.\nThe answer is: 0",
        "We can rewrite the expression as $(x - 3)^2 + 10$.\nSince $(x - 3)^2$ is always nonnegative, the smallest possible value of the expression is $\\boxed{10}$,\nwhich occurs when $(x - 3)^2$ is equal to 0 and $x = 3$.\nThe answer is: 10",
        "We want to find the smallest value of the expression $x^2 - 6x + 13$ when $x$ is an integer.\nTo find the minimum value, we can complete the square.\nRewriting the expression, we have $x^2 - 6x + 9 + 4$.\nNow, we can rewrite it as $(x - 3)^2 + 4$.\nSince $(x - 3)^2$ is always nonnegative, the smallest value of the expression is $\\boxed{4}$.\nThe answer is: 4",
        "We can factor the expression as $(x-1)(x-13)$.\nSince $x$ is an integer, the smallest value the expression can take is when $x$ is equal to the smallest root, which is 1.\nTherefore, the smallest value of the expression is $1^2 - 6(1) + 13 = \\boxed{10}$.\nThe answer is: 10",
        "We can rewrite the expression as $x^2 - 6x + 9 + 4$.\nThis expression has a perfect square trinomial in the form of $(x-3)^2 + 4$.\nSince $(x-3)^2$ is always nonnegative, the smallest possible value of the expression is $\\boxed{4}$.\nThe answer is: 4",
        "We can rewrite the expression $x^2 - 6x + 13$ as $(x - 3)^2 + 4$.\nSince $(x - 3)^2$ is always nonnegative, the smallest value of the expression occurs when $(x - 3)^2$ is 0, which happens when $x = 3$.\nTherefore, the smallest value of the expression is $0 + 4 = \\boxed{4}$.The answer is: 4",

        "We can rewrite the expression as $(x-3)^2 + 4$.\nSince $(x-3)^2$ is always nonnegative, the smallest value of the expression occurs when $(x-3)^2 = 0$.\nThis happens when $x = 3$.\nTherefore, the smallest value of the expression is $3^2 - 6(3) + 13 = \\boxed{10}$.The answer is: 10",
        "We can rewrite the expression as $(x-3)^2 + 10$.\nSince $(x-3)^2$ is always non-negative, the smallest possible value of the expression occurs when $(x-3)^2$ is equal to 0, which happens when $x = 3$.\nThus, the smallest value of the expression is $0 + 10 = \\boxed{10}$.\nThe answer is: 10",
        "We can rewrite the expression as $(x-3)^2 - 4$.\nSince the square of any integer is nonnegative, the smallest possible value of $(x-3)^2$ is 0.\nTherefore, the smallest possible value of the expression is $-4$.\nTo achieve this value, we need $x-3=0$, so the smallest value of $x$ that satisfies this condition is $x=3$.\nTherefore, the smallest value of the expression is $\\boxed{-4}$.\nThe answer is: -4",

        "First, we can complete the square by adding $(6/2)^2=9$ to the expression inside the parentheses: $x^2 - 6x + 13 = (x^2 - 6x + 9) + 4$.\nNext, we can rewrite the expression inside the parentheses as a perfect square trinomial: $(x-3)^2$.\nSo, the expression becomes $(x-3)^2 + 4$.\nSince $(x-3)^2$ is always nonnegative, the smallest value of the expression is $\\boxed{4}$.\nThe answer is: 4",
