        "If six cookies cost the same as 2 brownies, then one cookie costs the same as $\\frac{2}{6}=\\frac{1}{3}$ of a brownie.\nIf four brownies cost the same as 10 cupcakes, then one brownie costs the same as $\\frac{10}{4}=2.5$ cupcakes.\nSo, one cookie costs the same as $\\frac{1}{3}\\times2.5=\\frac{2.5}{3}$ cupcakes.\nTo find out how many cupcakes Bob can buy for the price of twenty-eight cookies, we can multiply the cost of one cookie in cupcakes by the number of cookies: $$\\frac{2.5}{3}\\times28=\\frac{2.5}{3}\\times\\frac{28}{1}=\\frac{70}{3}\\approx 23.33$$ Therefore, Bob can buy approximately $\\boxed{23}$ cupcakes for the price of twenty-eight cookies.The answer is: 23",
        "If six cookies cost the same as 2 brownies, then the cost of one brownie is 2/6 = 1/3 of the cost of one cookie.\nIf four brownies cost the same as 10 cupcakes, then the cost of one cupcake is 10/4 = 2.5 times the cost of one brownie.\nSo the cost of one cupcake is 2.5 * (1/3) = 1/2 of the cost of one cookie.\nIf Bob wants to know how many cupcakes he can buy for the price of twenty-eight cookies,\nhe needs to divide 28 by the cost of one cookie, and then multiply by the cost of one cupcake.\n28 / (1/2) = 28 * (2/1) = 56\nTherefore, Bob can buy \\boxed{56} cupcakes for the price of twenty-eight cookies.\nThe answer is: 56",

        "We have a ratio of 6 cookies to 2 brownies, and a ratio of 4 brownies to 10 cupcakes.\nTo find the ratio of cookies to cupcakes, we multiply the two ratios together.\nSo, 6 cookies is the same as (6/2) * (4/10) = 3 cupcakes.\nTherefore, for the price of twenty-eight cookies, Bob can buy 28/3 = 9 cupcakes.\nThe answer is: 9",
        "We know that 6 cookies = 2 brownies.\nSo, 28 cookies = $\\frac{28}{6} \\times 2 = 7$ brownies.\nWe also know that 4 brownies = 10 cupcakes.\nTherefore, 7 brownies = $\\frac{7}{4} \\times 10 = 17.5$ cupcakes.\nSince we can't buy half a cupcake, Bob can buy $\\boxed{17}$ cupcakes for the price of twenty-eight cookies.The answer is: 17",
        "We know that 6 cookies = 2 brownies and 4 brownies = 10 cupcakes.\nSo, if 6 cookies = 2 brownies, then 1 cookie = $\\frac{2}{6}=\\frac{1}{3}$ brownies.\nSimilarly, if 4 brownies = 10 cupcakes, then 1 brownie = $\\frac{10}{4}=2.5$ cupcakes.\nTherefore, 1 cookie = $\\frac{1}{3}$ brownies = $\\frac{1}{3}$ * 2.5 cupcakes = $\\frac{2.5}{3}$ cupcakes.\nFor the price of twenty-eight cookies, Bob can buy 28 * $\\frac{2.5}{3}$ cupcakes = $\\frac{70}{3}$ cupcakes.\nSo, Bob can buy $\\frac{70}{3}$ cupcakes for the price of twenty-eight cookies.\nThe answer is: \\frac{70}{3}",
        "We are given the ratios 6 cookies = 2 brownies and 4 brownies = 10 cupcakes.\nTo find out how many cupcakes Bob can buy for the price of twenty-eight cookies,\nwe need to find the ratio cookies to cupcakes.\nFrom the given information, we can set up the following ratios:\n6 cookies = 2 brownies and 4 brownies = 10 cupcakes.\nWe can substitute the first ratio into the second ratio to get:\n6 cookies = 2 (10 cupcakes).\nSimplifying, we find that 6 cookies = 20 cupcakes.\nTherefore, the ratio of cookies to cupcakes is 1:3.\nIf Bob has 28 cookies, he can buy 28/1 * 3/1 = 84 cupcakes.\nTherefore, Bob can buy 84 cupcakes for the price of twenty-eight cookies.The answer is: 84",
