        "Let the four consecutive integers be $n,$ $n+1,$ $n+2,$ and $n+3.$\nThe sum of these integers is $4n + 6.$\nWhen each integer is increased by 2, we get $n+2,$ $n+3+2,$ $n+4+2,$ and $n+5+2.$\nWhen each integer is multiplied by 20, we get $20(n+2),$ $20(n+3+2),$ $20(n+4+2),$ and $20(n+5+2).$\nThe sum of these integers is $20(n+2) + 20(n+3+2) + 20(n+4+2) + 20(n+5+2) = 80n + 160.$\nSince this sum is equal to 32, we can set up the equation $80n + 160 = 32$ and solve for $n$.\nSubtracting 160 from both sides gives $80n = -128$, and dividing both sides by 80 gives $n = -1.6.$\nSo the four consecutive integers are $-1.6,$ $-1.6+1,$ $-1.6+2,$ and $-1.6+3 = 0.$\nThe sum of these integers is $-1.6 + (-1.6+1) + (-1.6+2) + 0 = \\boxed{0}.$\nThe answer is: 0",

        "Let the first integer of the set be $n$. Since the integers are consecutive, the other integers in the set are $n+1$, $n+2$, and $n+3$.\nThe sum of the four integers is $n + (n+1) + (n+2) + (n+3) = 4n + 6$.\nAfter each integer is increased by 2 and then multiplied by 20, the sum becomes $20(2n+2)$.\nWe are given that this sum is 32, so $20(2n+2) = 32$.\nDividing both sides by 20 gives $2n+2=16$, and subtracting 2 gives $2n=14$.\nFinally, dividing both sides by 2 gives $n=7$.\nThe original set of integers is 7, 8, 9, and 10.\nThe sum of these four integers is $7+8+9+10 = \\boxed{34}$.The answer is: 34",
