        "The first seven positive odd integers are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13.\nWe can find the sum of these integers by adding them up: $1+3+5+7+9+11+13=64$.\nThus, the sum of the first seven positive odd integers is $\\boxed{64}$.The answer is: 64",
        "The odd integers are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13.\nThe sum of these integers is $1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 = \\boxed{49}$.\nThe answer is: 49",

        "The first seven positive odd integers are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13.\nWe can find the sum by adding these numbers together: $1+3+5+7+9+11+13=49$.\nTherefore, the sum of the first seven positive odd integers is $\\boxed{49}$.The answer is: 49",
        "The first positive odd integer is 1.\nThe second positive odd integer is 3.\nThe third positive odd integer is 5.\nAnd so on.\nWe can see that the pattern is that each positive odd integer is $2n - 1$, where $n$ is the position of the integer (starting from 1).\nSo the seventh positive odd integer is $2(7) - 1 = 13$.\nThe sum of the first seven positive odd integers is $1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 = \\boxed{46}$.The answer is: 46",
