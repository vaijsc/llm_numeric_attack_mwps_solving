        "Let's assume that Larry has L dollars and Lenny has L' dollars.\nAccording to the given information, Larry has three-quarters of Lenny's amount, so we can write the equation as L = (3/4)L'.\nWe also know that together, Larry and Lenny have $\\$$45, so we can write the equation as L + L' = 45.\nNow we can substitute the value of L from the first equation into the second equation: (3/4)L' + L' = 45.\nCombining the like terms, we have (7/4)L' = 45.\nTo isolate L', we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4/7: L' = (4/7)(45) = 20.\nNow we know that Lenny has 20 dollars.\nTo find out how many more dollars Lenny has than Larry, we subtract L from L': 20 - L.\nTo find the value of L, we can substitute the value of L' into the first equation: L = (3/4)(20) = 15.\nNow we can find the difference between Lenny and Larry: 20 - 15 = 5.\nLenny has 5 more dollars than Larry.\nThe answer is: 5",
        "Let's represent Lenny's amount as L dollars.\nAccording to the problem, Larry has three-quarters of Lenny's amount, so Larry has $\\frac{3}{4}L$ dollars.\nThe total amount of money together is $\\$45$, so we have the equation $L + \\frac{3}{4}L = \\$45$.\nSimplifying the equation, we get $\\frac{7}{4}L = \\$45$.\nTo solve for L, we divide both sides of the equation by $\\frac{7}{4}$, which gives us $L = \\frac{\\$45}{\\frac{7}{4}}$.\nDividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal, so we have $L = \\$45 \\cdot \\frac{4}{7}$.\nEvaluating the right side of the equation, we get $L = \\$20$.\nTo find the difference in dollars between Larry and Lenny, we subtract Larry's amount from Lenny's amount: $20 - \\frac{3}{4}L$.\nSubstituting the value of L, we have $20 - \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot 20 = \\$20 - \\$15 = \\boxed{\\$5}$.\nTherefore, Lenny has five more dollars than Larry.The answer is: 5",
        "Larry has $\\frac{3}{4}$ of Lenny's amount, so Lenny has $\\frac{4}{3}$ of Larry's amount. \nLenny has $\\frac{4}{3}$ of $\\$45$, which is $\\frac{4}{3} \\times \\$45 = \\$<<4/3*45=30>>30$. \nLarry has $\\$45 - \\$30 = \\$<<45-30=15>>15$. \nLenny has $\\$30 - \\$15 = \\$<<30-15=15>>15$ more than Larry. \nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{15}$.The answer is: 15",
