        "Kim has enough money to buy 40 oranges at $5x$ cents each, which means she has a total of $40 \\times 5x$ cents.\nNow, if the price rose to $6x$ cents per orange, we want to find how many oranges she could buy with the same amount of money.\nLet's set up an equation to represent this scenario. We have $40 \\times 5x$ cents on the left side and we want to solve for the number of oranges on the right side.\n$40 \\times 5x = \\text{number of oranges} \\times 6x$\nSimplifying, we get $200x = \\text{number of oranges} \\times 6x$\nDividing both sides of the equation by $6x$, we get $\\frac{200}{6} = \\text{number of oranges}$\nSimplifying further, we find that $\\text{number of oranges} = \\boxed{33\\frac{1}{3}}$\nThe answer is: 33\\frac{1}{3}",
        "To find out how many oranges Kim could buy with her current amount of money, we need to divide the total amount of money she has by the price per orange.\nThe total amount of money she has is $40 \\times 5x = 200x$ cents.\nThe price per orange is $6x$ cents.\nTherefore, the number of oranges she could buy is $\\frac{200x}{6x} = \\frac{200}{6} = \\boxed{33\\frac{1}{3}}$.\nSo, she could buy 33 oranges and 1/3 of an orange.The answer is: 33\\frac{1}{3}",
        "To find the number of oranges Kim could buy, we need to divide her total amount of money by the new price per orange.\nIn dollars, Kim has $40/(5x)$ dollars and the new price is $6x$ cents.\nTo compare these values, we need to convert them to the same unit.\nThere are $100$ cents in a dollar, so $40/(5x)$ dollars is equal to $40/(5x) \\times 100 = 800/(5x)$ cents.\nNow we can divide $800/(5x)$ cents by $6x$ cents to find the number of oranges Kim could buy.\n$\\dfrac{800}{5x} \\div 6x = \\dfrac{800}{5x} \\times \\dfrac{1}{6x} = \\dfrac{800}{30x^2} = \\dfrac{40}{15x^2}$\nSo, Kim could buy $\\dfrac{40}{15x^2}$ oranges.\nThe answer is: \\frac{40}{15x^2}",
