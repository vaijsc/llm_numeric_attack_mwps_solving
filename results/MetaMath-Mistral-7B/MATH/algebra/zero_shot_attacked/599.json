        "p(2) = 5$.\n$p(-1) = 5$ means that when we plug in $x = -1$ into the function $p(x)$, we get the output 5.\nNow let's use the second piece of information: $p(q(x)) = 4x + 7$ for all $x$.\nWe know that $q(-1)$ is the input that gives us $p(-1) = 5$.\nSo we can write the equation $p(q(-1)) = 4(-1) + 7$.\nSimplifying, we have $p(q(-1)) = -4 + 7 = 3$.\nSince $p(q(-1)) = 3$, we know that $q(-1)$ is the input that gives us $p(x) = 3$ as the output.\nTherefore, $q(-1)$ is equal to $\\boxed{3}$.The answer is: 3",
