        "We are given that $-8a + 3b = -23$ and that $a$ and $b$ are consecutive integers, with $a < b$.\nTo find the value of $a$, we can think about the possibilities for $a$ and $b$.\nSince $a$ and $b$ are consecutive integers, we can write $b$ as $a + 1$.\nSubstituting this into the equation $-8a + 3b = -23$, we get $-8a + 3(a + 1) = -23$.\nSimplifying, we have $-8a + 3a + 3 = -23$.\nCombining like terms, we have $-5a + 3 = -23$.\nSubtracting 3 from both sides, we have $-5a = -26$.\nDividing both sides by $-5$, we have $a = 5$.\nTherefore, the value of $a$ is $\\boxed{5}$.\nThe answer is: 5",
