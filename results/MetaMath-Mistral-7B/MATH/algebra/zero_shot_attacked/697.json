        "The first term of the geometric sequence is 3.\nEach successive term is calculated by multiplying the previous term by $\\frac{m}{7}$.\nSo, the second term is $3 \\cdot \\frac{m}{7} = \\frac{3m}{7}$, the third term is $\\frac{3m}{7} \\cdot \\frac{m}{7} = \\frac{3m^2}{49}$, and so on.\nTo find the number of possible integer values for $m$, we need to find the number of values of $m$ that make each term an integer.\nFor the second term to be an integer, $\\frac{3m}{7}$ must be an integer.\nThis means that $m$ must be a multiple of 7.\nFor the third term to be an integer, $\\frac{3m^2}{49}$ must be an integer.\nThis means that $m$ must be a multiple of 49.\nSince $m$ must be a multiple of both 7 and 49, it must be a multiple of the least common multiple of 7 and 49, which is 49.\nTherefore, the possible integer values for $m$ are 49, 98, 147, etc.\nBut we need to be careful not to include negative values.\nSince $m$ must be positive for each term to be positive, the possible integer values for $m$ are 49, 98, 147, etc.\nTherefore, the number of possible integer values for $m$ is $\\boxed{3}$.The answer is: 3",
        "The first term of the geometric sequence is 3, so we can write the terms as 3, 3 * (m/7), 3 * (m/7)^2, and so on.\nFor each term, we multiply the previous term by (m/7).\nTo find the number of possible integer values for m, we need to find the values of m that make the terms integers.\nIf the terms are integers, then (m/7)^n must be an integer, where n is the position of the term in the sequence.\nLet's consider the first few terms:\nTerm 1: 3\nTerm 2: 3 * (m/7)\nTerm 3: 3 * (m/7)^2\nTerm 4: 3 * (m/7)^3\nFrom the first term to the fourth term, the exponent of (m/7) increases by 1 for each term.\nFor the fourth term to be an integer, (m/7)^3 must be an integer.\nSince (m/7)^3 must be an integer for the fourth term, it must also be an integer for the first, second, and third terms.\nTherefore, we need to find the values of m that make (m/7)^3 an integer.\nWe can test different values of m to see which ones satisfy this condition.\nLet's test m = 1: (m/7)^3 = (1/7)^3 = 1/343, which is an integer.\nLet's test m = 2: (m/7)^3 = (2/7)^3 = 8/343, which is an integer.\nLet's test m = 3: (m/7)^3 = (3/7)^3 = 27/343, which is an integer.\nBased on these tests, we can conclude that for m = 1, 2, or 3, (m/7)^3 is an integer.\nTherefore, there are 3 possible integer values for m.\nThe answer is: 3",
        "The first term of the geometric sequence is 3.\nEach successive term is calculated by multiplying the previous term by $\\frac{m}{7}$.\nSo, the second term is $3 \\cdot \\frac{m}{7}$, the third term is $3 \\cdot \\frac{m}{7} \\cdot \\frac{m}{7}$, and so on.\nFor a geometric sequence, all terms must be divisible by their respective previous term.\nSince the first term is 3, the second term must be divisible by 3.\nBut $\\frac{m}{7}$ is an integer, so the second term is also divisible by $\\frac{m}{7}$.\nTherefore, the second term must be divisible by the least common multiple (LCM) of 3 and $\\frac{m}{7}$.\nThe LCM of 3 and $\\frac{m}{7}$ must also be divisible by 7, so the LCM must be a multiple of 21.\nFor the second term to be divisible by 21, $\\frac{m}{7}$ must be a multiple of 3, so $m$ must be a multiple of 21.\nTherefore, the number of possible integer values for $m$ is equal to the number of factors of 21, which is $\\boxed{6}$.\nThe answer is: 6",
