        "The given quadratic expression is $x^2 + bx + c$.\nWe are told that this quadratic is positive only when $x \\in (-\\infty, -7) \\cup (3,\\infty)$.\nThis means that the quadratic is negative when $x \\in (-7, 3)$.\nIn order for the quadratic to have this behavior, the graph of the quadratic must be a U-shaped curve that is below the x-axis when $x \\in (-7, 3)$ and above the x-axis when $x \\in (-\\infty, -7) \\cup (3,\\infty)$.\nThe vertex of a U-shaped curve is the lowest point, which is where the quadratic is negative.\nSo, the vertex of the quadratic must be at $(h, k)$ where $h = -7$ and $k$ is the minimum value of the quadratic.\nSince the quadratic is positive when $x \\in (-\\infty, -7) \\cup (3,\\infty)$, the vertex must be at $(-7, k)$.\nSince the vertex is at $(-7, k)$, we have two equations:\n$x = -7$ and $x^2 + bx + c = k$.\nSubstituting $x = -7$ into the second equation gives $(-7)^2 + b(-7) + c = k$, which simplifies to $49 - 7b + c = k$.\nSince the vertex is at $(-7, k)$, we know that $-7$ is a solution to the quadratic expression, so we can substitute $x = -7$ into the quadratic to get $(-7)^2 + b(-7) + c = 0$.\nSimplifying this equation gives $49 - 7b + c = 0$.\nWe now have the system of equations $49 - 7b + c = k$ and $49 - 7b + c = 0$.\nSubtracting the second equation from the first gives $k - 0 = k$, so $k$ can take on any value.\nTherefore, the value of $b + c$ is the same as the value of $b + c$ in the equation $49 - 7b + c = 0$.\nSolving this equation for $c$ gives $c = 7",
