        "We can see that the common difference of this arithmetic sequence is 7.\nTo find the number of terms, we want to find the number of integers that can be expressed in the form $a_1 + 7(n-1)$, where $n$ is the number of terms.\nWe want the last term to be 6908, so we have $a_1 + 7(n-1) = 6908$.\nSimplifying, we get $a_1 + 7n - 7 = 6908$.\nSince we know that $a_1 = 13$, we can substitute to get $13 + 7n - 7 = 6908$.\nSimplifying further, we get $7n = 6907$.\nDividing both sides by 7, we find that $n = 987$.\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{987}$ integers in the arithmetic sequence.\nThe answer is: 987",
