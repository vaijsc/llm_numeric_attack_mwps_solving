        "If a two-pound cake requires 1.5 cups of flour, then we can set up a proportion to find out how many cups are needed for a five-pound cake.\n2 pounds is to 1.5 cups as 5 pounds is to x cups.\nThis can be written as 2/1.5 = 5/x.\nTo solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 2x = 1.5 * 5.\nSimplifying, we get 2x = 7.5.\nDividing both sides by 2, we find that x = 3.75.\nHowever, since we are measuring in cups, we can't have a fraction of a cup.\nTherefore, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.\nSo, 2 five-pound cakes would require 2 * 3.75 = 7.5 cups of flour.\nRounding up, we find that we need 8 cups of flour.\nThe answer is: 8",

        "\nIf a two-pound cake requires 1.5 cups of flour, then we can find the ratio of cups to pounds.\n1.5 cups / 2 pounds = 0.75 cups per pound.\nNow, let's find out how many cups are needed for 2 five-pound cakes.\n2 five-pound cakes = 2 * 5 = 10 pounds in total.\nSo, we need 0.75 cups * 10 pounds = 7.5 cups of flour for 2 five-pound cakes.\n#### 7.5\nThe answer is: 7.5",
