        "Let's represent Andrew's age as $A$ and his grandfather's age as $G$.\nAccording to the given information, $G = 8A$.\nWe also know that when Andrew was born, his grandfather was 76 years old.\nThis means that the age difference between them is $76$ years.\nSo, $G - A = 76$.\nSubstituting $G = 8A$, we have $8A - A = 76$.\nSimplifying, we get $7A = 76$.\nDividing both sides by $7$, we find $A = 11$.\nTherefore, Andrew is currently $\\boxed{11}$ years old.\nThe answer is: 11",
        "Let Andrew's age now be A.\nAccording to the problem, Andrew's grandfather's age is eight times Andrew's age, so his age now is 8A.\nWe also know that Andrew's grandfather was 76 years old when Andrew was born, which means the age difference between them is 76 years.\nSo we can set up the equation: 8A - A = 76\nSimplifying the equation, we get: 7A = 76\nDividing both sides by 7, we get: A = 11\nTherefore, Andrew is currently 11 years old.\nThe answer is: 11",
        "Let's assume Andrew's age is A and his grandfather's age is G.\nWe are given that Andrew's grandfather's age is eight times Andrew's age, so we can write the equation G = 8A.\nWe are also given that Andrew's grandfather was 76 years old when Andrew was born, so we can write the equation G - A = 76.\nSubstituting the value of G from the first equation into the second equation, we get 8A - A = 76.\nSimplifying the equation, we get 7A = 76.\nDividing both sides of the equation by 7, we get A = 11.\nTherefore, Andrew is currently 11 years old.\n#### 11\nThe answer is: 11",
        "Let A be Andrew's age and G be Andrew's grandfather's age.\nWe know that G = 8A.\nWe also know that when Andrew was born, his grandfather was 76 years old.\nThis means there is a 76-year age difference between them.\nSo, G - A = 76.\nSubstituting G = 8A, we get 8A - A = 76.\nCombining like terms, we get 7A = 76.\nDividing both sides by 7, we get A = 11.\nTherefore, Andrew is currently 11 years old.\nThe answer is: 11",
        "We can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. We'll call Andrew's age A and his grandfather's age G.\nWe know that G = 8A (Andrew's grandfather's age is eight times Andrew's age).\nWe also know that G - A = 76 (Andrew's grandfather was 76 years old when Andrew was born).\nWe want to find the value of A, which represents Andrew's current age.\nLet's substitute G = 8A into the second equation:\n8A - A = 76\n7A = 76\nDivide both sides by 7:\nA = 11\nSo, Andrew is currently 11 years old.\n#### 11\nThe answer is: 11",
        "Let's represent Andrew's age as $x$.\nAccording to the given information, Andrew's grandfather's age is $8x$.\nWe also know that when Andrew was born, his grandfather was 76 years old.\nSo the age difference between Andrew and his grandfather is $8x - x = 76$.\nSimplifying this equation, we get $7x = 76$.\nDividing both sides by 7, we find that $x = 11$.\nTherefore, Andrew is currently $\\boxed{11}$ years old.\nThe answer is: 11",
        "Let's represent Andrew's age as $a$ and his grandfather's age as $g$.\nAccording to the problem, we have the equation $g=8a$.\nWe also know that when Andrew was born, his grandfather was 76 years old.\nThis means that the age difference between them is $76$ years.\nSince Andrew is currently older than when he was born, we can say that $a$ represents Andrew's current age.\nSo, the age difference between them is equal to $g-a=76$ years.\nSubstituting $g=8a$, we have $8a-a=76$.\nSimplifying the equation, we get $7a=76$.\nDividing both sides by 7, we find that $a=11$.\nTherefore, Andrew is currently $\\boxed{11}$ years old.\nThe answer is: 11",
        "Let's assume Andrew's age is A and his grandfather's age is G.\nAccording to the problem, G = 8A (Andrew's grandfather's age is eight times Andrew's age).\nWhen Andrew was born, his grandfather was 76 years old. This means there is a 76-year age difference between them.\nTherefore, G - A = 76 (Andrew's grandfather's age minus Andrew's age equals 76).\nWe can substitute G with 8A in this equation to get: 8A - A = 76.\nSimplifying, we get: 7A = 76.\nDividing both sides by 7, we find that A = 11.\nTherefore, Andrew is currently 11 years old.\n#### 11\nThe answer is: 11",
        "Let's assume Andrew's age is x.\nThen, Andrew's grandfather's age is 8x.\nWe know that Andrew's grandfather was 76 years old when Andrew was born, which means there is a 76-year age difference between them.\nSince Andrew is currently x years old, his grandfather is currently 8x years old.\nTherefore, 8x - x = 76.\nSimplifying further, 7x = 76.\nDividing both sides by 7, we get x = 11.\nSo, Andrew is currently 11 years old.\n#### 11\nThe answer is: 11",
        "Let's represent Andrew's age as $x$ and his grandfather's age as $8x$.\nWe know that when Andrew was born, his grandfather was 76 years old. This means there is a 76-year age difference between them.\nSo we can set up the equation $8x - x = 76$.\nSimplifying, we get $7x = 76$.\nDividing both sides by 7, we find $x = 11$.\nTherefore, Andrew is currently $\\boxed{11}$ years old.\nThe answer is: 11",
        "We can set up the equation: $8x = 76$, where $x$ represents Andrew's age.\nSimplifying, we find $x = \\frac{76}{8} = 9.5$.\nSince we can't have a fraction of a year, we round up to the nearest whole number.\nTherefore, Andrew is currently $\\boxed{10}$ years old.\nThe answer is: 10",
        "Let's assume Andrew's age is $x$.\nAccording to the problem, Andrew's grandfather's age is eight times Andrew's age, so his age is $8x$.\nWe also know that Andrew's grandfather was 76 years old when Andrew was born.\nThis means there is a $76$ year age difference between them.\nSince Andrew's grandfather is $8x$ years old and Andrew is $x$ years old, we can set up the equation $8x - x = 76$.\nSimplifying the equation, we get $7x = 76$.\nDividing both sides by $7$, we find $x = 11$.\nTherefore, Andrew is currently $\\boxed{11}$ years old.The answer is: 11",
