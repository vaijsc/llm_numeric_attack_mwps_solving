        "Let's say there are $5x$ blue marbles and $3x$ yellow marbles in the bag.\nAccording to the given information, $\\frac{5x}{3x}=\\frac{5}{3}$.\nSimplifying, we have $\\frac{5}{3}=\\frac{5}{3}$, which is true.\nTherefore, the number of blue marbles and yellow marbles in the bag is in the ratio of 5:3.\nNow, when 5 blue marbles are added and 3 yellow marbles are removed, the ratio becomes $\\frac{5x+5}{3x-3}=\\frac{7}{3}$.\nSimplifying, we have $\\frac{5x+5}{3x-3}=\\frac{7}{3}$.\nCross-multiplying, we get $5x+5=7(3x-3)$.\nExpanding and simplifying, we have $5x+5=21x-21$.\nBringing like terms to one side, we have $5x-21x=-16$.\nCombining like terms, we have $-16x=-16$.\nDividing by $-16$, we get $x=1$.\nTherefore, there are $5(1)=5$ blue marbles in the bag before any were added.The answer is: 5",
        "Let the number of blue marbles and yellow marbles before adding any be $5x$ and $3x$, respectively.\nAfter adding 5 blue marbles, the new number of blue marbles is $5x+5$.\nAfter removing 3 yellow marbles, the new number of yellow marbles is $3x-3$.\nThe new ratio of blue marbles to yellow marbles is $\\frac{5x+5}{3x-3}$.\nWe are given that this new ratio is 7:3.\nSo, we have the equation $\\frac{5x+5}{3x-3}=\\frac{7}{3}$.\nCross-multiplying, we get $15x+15=21x-9$.\nSimplifying, we find $6x=24$, so $x=4$.\nTherefore, the number of blue marbles before adding any is $5x=5(4)=\\boxed{20}$.\nThe answer is: 20",
        "We can set up a proportion to solve this problem. Let's call the number of blue marbles before adding more \"b\" and the number of yellow marbles before adding or removing \"y\".\nAfter adding 5 blue marbles and removing 3 yellow marbles, the new ratio of blue marbles to yellow marbles is 7:3. This can be represented as b+5 : y-3.\nWe can set up the proportion: b/y = (b+5)/(y-3).\nWe are given that the original ratio is 5:3, so we can write: b/y = 5/3.\nTo simplify the proportion, we can cross multiply: 3b = 5y.\nWe are also given that the new ratio is 7:3, so we can write: (b+5)/(y-3) = 7/3.\nTo simplify the second proportion, we can cross multiply: 3(b+5) = 7(y-3).\nNow we have two equations: 3b = 5y and 3b + 15 = 7y - 21.\nWe can solve this system of equations by substituting the first equation into the second equation: 3(5y) + 15 = 7y - 21.\nSimplifying, we get: 15y + 15 = 7y - 21.\nSubtracting 7y from both sides, we get: 8y + 15 = -21.\nSubtracting 15 from both sides, we get: 8y = -36.\nDividing both sides by 8, we get: y = -4.5.\nSince we are counting marbles, we cannot have a negative number of marbles. Therefore, the original number of blue marbles before adding more must have been: b = 5 * 4.5 = 22.5.\nHowever, we cannot have a fraction of a marble, so we can round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the original number of blue marbles before adding more is \\boxed{22}.The answer is: 22",
        "We know that the ratio of blue marbles to yellow marbles is 5:3 after adding 5 blue marbles and removing 3 yellow marbles.\nSo, the ratio of blue marbles to yellow marbles after these changes is 7:3.\nTo find the original ratio before the changes, we can set up the following equation:\n5x : 3x = 7y : 3y\nWhere x represents the number of blue marbles and y represents the number of yellow marbles before the changes.\nWe can simplify the equation by cross-multiplying:\n5x * 3y = 7y * 3x\n15xy = 21xy\n15x = 21\nx = 14/5\nSo, there were 14 blue marbles in the bag before I added more.\nThe answer is: 14",
        "Let's say there are 5x yellow marbles and 3x blue marbles in the bag initially.\nAfter adding 5 blue marbles and removing 3 yellow marbles, the number of blue marbles will be 3x + 5 and the number of yellow marbles will be 5x - 3.\nAccording to the problem, the ratio of blue marbles to yellow marbles is 7:3 after these changes.\nThis implies that (3x + 5)/(5x - 3) = 7/3.\nCross-multiplying, we get 3(3x + 5) = 7(5x - 3).\nExpanding and simplifying, we get 9x + 15 = 35x - 21.\nSubtracting 9x from both sides, we get 15 = 26x - 21.\nAdding 21 to both sides, we get 36 = 26x.\nDividing both sides by 26, we get x = 1.4.\nTherefore, there are 3x = 3(1.4) = 4.2 blue marbles in the bag initially.\nHowever, since we cannot have a fraction of a marble, we can conclude that there were 4 blue marbles in the bag before adding more.\nThe answer is: 4",
