        "If the ratio of female students to the total number of students is 6 to 9, we can set up the proportion:\n$\\frac{\\text{female students}}{\\text{total students}} = \\frac{6}{9}$\nWe are given that there are 396 female students, so we can substitute this into the proportion:\n$\\frac{396}{\\text{total students}} = \\frac{6}{9}$\nCross multiplying, we get:\n$396 \\cdot 9 = 6 \\cdot \\text{total students}$\nSimplifying, we have:\n$3504 = 6 \\cdot \\text{total students}$\nDividing both sides by 6, we find:\n$\\text{total students} = 584$\nNow that we know the total number of students, we can find the number of teachers using the ratio of teachers to students, which is 1 to 11:\n$\\text{number of teachers} = \\frac{\\text{teachers}}{\\text{students}} \\cdot \\text{total students} = 1 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 584 = \\boxed{6328}$\nThe answer is: 6328",
        "Since the ratio of female students to the total number of students is 6 to 9, we can set up the equation:\n(6/9) * Total number of students = 396\nSimplifying this equation, we find that:\nTotal number of students = 396 / (6/9) = 396 * (9/6) = 660\nNow, since the ratio of teachers to students is 1 to 11, we can find the number of teachers by setting up the equation:\n(1/11) * Total number of students = Number of teachers\nSimplifying this equation, we find that:\nNumber of teachers = 660 * (1/11) = 60\nSo, there are 60 teachers in the school.\nThe answer is: 60",
        "We know that the ratio of teachers to students is 1 to 11, which means for every 1 teacher, there are 11 students.\nWe also know that the ratio of female students to the total number of students is 6 to 9, which means for every 6 female students, there are 9 students in total.\nIf there are 396 female students, we can set up a proportion to find the total number of students: 6/9 = 396/x, where x is the total number of students.\nCross multiplying, we get 6x = 9 * 396.\nDividing both sides by 6, we find that x = 396 * 9 / 6 = 660.\nSince the ratio of teachers to students is 1 to 11, we can find the number of teachers by dividing the total number of students by 11: 660 / 11 = 60.\nTherefore, there are 60 teachers in the school.\n#### 60\nThe answer is: 60",
        "The ratio of female students to the total number of students is 6 to 9, which can be simplified to 2 to 3.\nSo, out of every 2 students, 1 is female and the other is male.\nIf there are 396 female students, then there are 396 * 3 = 1188 students in total.\nThe ratio of teachers to students is 1 to 11, which means there are 150 teachers in the school.\nTherefore, there are 150 teachers in the school.The answer is: 150",
        "The ratio of female students to the total number of students is 6:9, which means that the female students make up 6/9 or 2/3 of the total number of students.\nIf there are 396 female students, then the total number of students is 396 / (2/3) = 396 * (3/2) = 594 students.\nThe ratio of teachers to students is 1:11, which means that for every 1 teacher, there are 11 students.\nTherefore, the number of teachers is 594 / 11 = 54.\n#### 54\nThe answer is: 54",
        "According to the ratio of teachers to students, there are 1 teacher for every 11 students.\nLet's assume there are 11x students and 1x teachers.\nAccording to the ratio of female students to the total number of students, there are 6/9 or 2/3 female students for every 9 students.\nThis means that there are (2/3)(11x) = 396 female students.\nSimplifying, we have (22/3)x = 396.\nDividing both sides by (22/3), we get x = (3/3)(396) = 132.\nTherefore, there are 1(132) = 132 teachers in the school.\nThe answer is: 132",
        "We are given that the ratio of female students to the total number of students is 6 to 9.\nIf there are 396 female students, this means the total number of students is 9 parts, and 6 parts of those 9 parts are female students.\nSo, the number of female students is 6/9 * total number of students = 2/3 * total number of students.\nTherefore, the total number of students is 396 / (2/3) = 396 * (3/2) = 594 students.\nWe are also given that the ratio of teachers to students is 1 to 11.\nSo, the number of teachers is 1/11 * total number of students = 1/11 * 594 = 54 teachers.\nTherefore, there are 54 teachers in the school.\nThe answer is: 54",
