        "The first term is 38 and the last term is 86.\nTo find the common difference, we subtract 38 from 86: $86-38=48$.\nThe number of terms in the series can be found by subtracting the first term from the last term and dividing by the common difference: $\\frac{86-38}{48}=\\frac{48}{48}=1$.\nSo, there is only 1 term in the series.\nTherefore, the value of the arithmetic series is $\\frac{38+86}{2}=\\frac{124}{2}=\\boxed{62}$.The answer is: 62",
