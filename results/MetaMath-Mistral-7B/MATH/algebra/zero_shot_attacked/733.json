        "To find the price that maximizes revenue, we need to find the price that maximizes the product of the number of books sold and the price per book.\nThe number of books sold per month is given by the expression 100 - 2p.\nLet's call the price per book x.\nThe revenue can be calculated as the product of the number of books sold and the price per book:\nRevenue = (100 - 2p) * x\nTo find the price that maximizes the revenue, we can take the derivative of the revenue with respect to x and set it equal to zero:\n(100 - 2p) * 0 + x * (-2) = 0\n-2x = 0\nThis tells us that the price per book should be x = 0 to maximize revenue.\nHowever, it is not possible to sell books for $0, so there is no price that will maximize the revenue.\nTherefore, the bookstore cannot determine a specific price to maximize its revenue.\nThe answer is: 0",
