        "We need to find the smallest integer value of $n$ such that $n^2 - 5n - 14 < 0$.\nTo find this value, we can factor the quadratic as $(n-7)(n+2) < 0$.\nTo determine when this inequality is true, we can create a sign chart.\nWe know that $(n-7)$ and $(n+2)$ are both factors, and so their signs determine when the inequality is true or false.\nIn the interval $(-\\infty, -2)$, both factors are negative, so the product is positive.\nIn the interval $(-2, 7)$ one factor is positive and one factor is negative, so the product is negative.\nIn the interval $(7, \\infty)$, both factors are positive, so the product is positive.\nTherefore, the inequality is true when $n$ is in the interval $(-2, 7)$.\nThe smallest integer value of $n$ in this interval is $\\boxed{-2}$.\nThe answer is: -2",
