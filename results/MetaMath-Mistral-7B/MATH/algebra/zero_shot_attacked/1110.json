        "First, we evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: 7 & 5 = 3.\nThen, we evaluate the expression & 8: 3 & 8 = 2.\nTherefore, the value of the given expression is $\\boxed{2}$.The answer is: 2",
        "The first step is to evaluate the expression inside the parentheses (7 & 5).\nSince & is the bitwise AND operator, we perform the operation on each pair of corresponding bits.\nThe result is 7 & 5, which is 5.\nNow we replace (7 & 5) with 5 in the original expression.\nThe new expression is 5 & 8.\nPerforming the bitwise AND operation, we get the final value of 5.\nTherefore, the value of (7 & 5) & 8 is $\\boxed{5}$.The answer is: 5",
        "First, we need to evaluate the expression inside the parentheses. 7 and 5 refers to the bitwise AND operation.\n7 = 111 in binary (ones represent 1, zeros represent 0)\n5 = 101 in binary\nSo, the result of the bitwise AND operation is 7 & 5 = 111 & 101 = 101 in binary.\nNow, let's evaluate 101 & 8.\n8 = 1000 in binary\nSo, 101 & 8 = 101 & 1000 = 100 in binary.\nFinally, the value of (7 & 5) & 8 is 100 in binary, which is equal to 4 in decimal.\nThe answer is: 4",
        "First, we evaluate $7 & 5$. This means we compare $7$ and $5$, and find that $7$ is greater than $5$. So, the result of $7 & 5$ is $7$.\nNext, we evaluate $7 & 8$. Again, we compare $7$ and $8$, and find that $8$ is greater than $7$. So, the result of $7 & 8$ is $8$.\nTherefore, the value of $(7 & 5) & 8$ is $8$.The answer is: 8",
        "The symbol \u201c&\u201d represents the bitwise AND operator, which gives the result of two binary numbers having a 1 in the result only if both of the original numbers had a 1 in that position.\nConverting the numbers into binary, we have:\n7: 111\n5: 101\n8: 1000\nTo find the result, we need to find the AND of these three numbers.\n111 & 101 & 1000 = 101\nSo the result is 101, which is equal to 5 in decimal form.\nTherefore, the value of (7 & 5) & 8 is $\\boxed{5}$.The answer is: 5",
        "First, let's evaluate the expression inside the first set of parentheses, which is 7 & 5.\nAccording to the rules of bitwise operations, & is the \"and\" operator, which gives a result of 1 only when both inputs are 1.\nSince 7 & 5 equals 5, we can rewrite the expression as (5 & 8).\nNext, we evaluate the expression inside the second set of parentheses, which is 5 & 8.\nAccording to the rules of bitwise operations, & is the \"and\" operator, which gives a result of 1 only when both inputs are 1.\nSince 5 & 8 equals 0, we can rewrite the expression as (0).\nFinally, we evaluate 0, which is the result of the expression.\nTherefore, the value of (7 & 5) & 8 is 0.\nThe answer is: 0",

        "First, we perform the operation inside the parentheses: 7 & 5.\nIn binary, 7 is 111 and 5 is 101, so 7 & 5 is 101.\nNext, we perform the operation between the parentheses and 8: 101 & 8.\nIn binary, 8 is 1000.\nTo find the result, we perform the bitwise AND operation between 101 and 1000, which gives us 100.\nTherefore, (7 & 5) & 8 is equal to \\boxed{100}.\nThe answer is: 100",
        "First, we evaluate 7 & 5, which gives us 2.\nThen, we evaluate 2 & 8, which gives us 0.\nTherefore, the value of (7 & 5) & 8 is $\\boxed{0}$.The answer is: 0",
        "We first evaluate the expression within the parentheses: $7&5=12$.\nThen, we evaluate the remaining expression: $12&8=20$.\nThus, the value of $(7&5)&8$ is $\\boxed{20}$.The answer is: 20",
        "First, we evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: $7 & 5 = 14$.\nThen, we perform the second bitwise AND operation with the result and 8: $14 & 8 = 12$.\nTherefore, the value of $(7 & 5) & 8$ is $\\boxed{12}$.The answer is: 12",

        "First, we evaluate (7 & 5).\nSince 7 is greater than 5, (7 & 5) evaluates to 5.\nNow, we evaluate 5 & 8.\nSince 5 is less than 8, (5 & 8) evaluates to 5.\nTherefore, (7 & 5) & 8 is equal to 5.\nThe answer is: 5",
