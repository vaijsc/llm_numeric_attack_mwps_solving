        "From the given information, we know the following:\n- Abby + Bart = 660 pounds\n- Bart + Cindy = 180 pounds\n- Cindy + Damon = 200 pounds\nWe want to find Abby + Damon.\nTo find Abby + Damon, we need to find the value of Abby and Damon separately.\nTo do this, we can use substitution or elimination.\nLet's use substitution.\nFrom the equation Bart + Cindy = 180 pounds, we can substitute Bart with 660 - Abby (since Abby + Bart = 660 pounds).\nSo, Cindy + 660 - Abby = 180 pounds.\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n660 - Abby + Cindy = 180\nCindy + Abby - 660 = -180\nCindy + Abby = 480\nNow, we have two equations:\nCindy + Abby = 480\nCindy + Damon = 200\nSubtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:\n480 - 480 = 200 - Cindy - Damon\n0 = 200 - Cindy - Damon\n0 = 200 - (Cindy + Damon)\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n0 = 200 - Cindy - Damon\n0 = 200 - (Cindy + Damon)\n0 = 200 - Cindy - Damon\nCindy + Damon = 200\nSo, Cindy + Damon = 200 pounds.\nTherefore, Abby + Damon = 480 - Cindy + Damon = 480 - 200 = 280 pounds.\nThe answer is: 280",
