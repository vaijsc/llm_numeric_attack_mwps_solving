        "\nWhen a parabola is reflected across the vertical line $y=k$, it is scaled vertically by a factor of $-1$.\nThis means that the vertex of the reflected parabola is identical to the vertex of the original parabola, but the equation of the reflected parabola is obtained by multiplying the equation of the original parabola by $-1$ and moving the horizontal position of each term by the same amount.\nSo, the equation of the reflected parabola is $y = -a(x-h)^2 + k - (bx + c)$, which simplifies to $y = -a(x-h)^2 + (k-bx - c)$.\nExpanding and comparing coefficients with the given equation $y = dx^2 + ex + f$, we have:\n$a = d$, $h = 0$, $b = -e$, $c = -f$, $k = f$, and $k - b = d$.\nTherefore, $a + b + c + d + e + f = d + (-e) - f + f = \\boxed{d}$.The answer is: d",
        "The reflection of a parabola about the line $y = k$ results in a parabola with the same vertex and an upward-opening reflection of the graph.\nThis means that the equation of the reflected parabola can be obtained by changing the sign of the $a$ coefficient in the original equation.\nSo, the equation of the reflected parabola is $y = -ax^2 + bx + c$.\nWe are given that the vertex of the original parabola is $(h, k)$, so the vertex of the reflected parabola is also $(h, k)$.\nSince the vertex is the same, the values of $h$ and $k$ remain unchanged in the reflected parabola.\nTherefore, $h = d$ and $k = f$.\nThe coefficients $a$ and $b$ remain the same, so $a = a$ and $b = e$.\nTo find $d+e+f$, we substitute the given values: $d = h = a$, $e = b$, and $f = k$.\nSo, $a+b+c+d+e+f = a + b + c + a + b + k = 2(a + b) + k$.\nSubstituting $k = f = k$, we get $2(a + b) + k = 2(a + b) + k$.\nTherefore, the value of $a+b+c+d+e+f$ is equal to $2(a + b) + k$.\nThe answer is: 2",
        "The vertex form of a parabola is given by $y=a(x-h)^2+k$, where $(h,k)$ is the vertex.\nWhen a parabola is reflected about the line $y=k$, the vertex remains the same, but the coefficient of $(x-h)^2$ changes to $-a$.\nSo, the equation of the reflected parabola is $y=-a(x-h)^2+k$.\nExpanding this equation, we get $y=-ax^2+ah^2+k$.\nComparing this with the equation $y=ax^2+bx+c$, we see that $d=-a$, $e=ah^2$, $f=k$, and $a+b+c+d+e+f=-a+ah^2+k$.\nSince the vertex of the original parabola is $(h,k)$, the value of $h^2$ is $h^2$.\nTherefore, $a+b+c+d+e+f=-a+ah^2+k=a(h^2-1)+k$.\nThe answer is: 1",
        "The line $y=k$ is the line of reflection, so the parabola reflected over this line will have the same $x$-coordinates as the original parabola.\nIf the original parabola's vertex is $(h, k)$, then the reflected parabola's vertex will be $(h, -k)$.\nSince the parabola is reflected over the line $y=k$, the equation of the reflected parabola is of the form $y=a(x-h)^2+k$.\nComparing this to the equation of the original parabola, $y=ax^2+bx+c$, we can see that $a=1$, $b=2ah$, $c=k$, $d=1$, $e=-2h$, and $f=k$.\nTherefore, $a+b+c+d+e+f = 1 + 2ah + k - 2h + k = (2a+e)h + (2d+f) = 2+k+k = \\boxed{4+2k}$.The answer is: 4+2k",
        "The reflection of a point $(x,y)$ about the line $y=k$ is the point $(x,2k-y)$.\nSince the vertex of the original parabola is $(h,k)$, the vertex of the reflected parabola is $(h,2k-k)=(h,k)$.\nTherefore, the equation of the reflected parabola can be written as $y=a(x-h)^2+k$.\nExpanding this, we get $y=ax^2-2ahx+ah^2+k$.\nComparing this with the equation $y=dx^2+ex+f$, we can see that $a=d$, $-2ah=e$, $ah^2+k=f$.\nSo, the value of $a+b+c+d+e+f$ is $a+(d-2ah)+ah^2+k=-(2ah)+ah^2+k=\\boxed{h^2}$.\nThe answer is: h^2",
        "When a parabola is reflected over the line $y=k$, the vertex of the reflected parabola is the same as the vertex of the original parabola.\nSo the vertex of the reflected parabola is $(h,k)$.\nThe equation of the reflected parabola is of the form $y=k-a(x-h)^2$.\nComparing this with $y=ax^2+bx+c$, we can see that $d=a$, $e=-2ah$, and $f=k$.\nTherefore, $a+b+c+d+e+f=a-2ah+b+c+a+k=2a+b+c+k$.\nSince the vertex of the original parabola is $(h,k)$, the parabola passes through the point $(h,k)$.\nSo when we substitute $x=h$ and $y=k$ into the equation $y=ax^2+bx+c$, we get $k=ah^2+bh+c$.\nTherefore, $2a+b+c+k=2a+b+c+ah^2+bh+c=2a(1+h^2)+b(1+h)$.\nSince we want to find $a+b+c+d+e+f$ in terms of $k$, we substitute $2a=2$, $b=1$, and $c=k-h^2a-hb$ into this expression: $2(1)+(1+h)+(k-h^2a-hb)$.\nSimplifying, we get $2+1+h+k-h^2a-hb$.\nSince the vertex of the original parabola is $(h,k)$, the equation of the original parabola is of the form $y=a(x-h)^2+k$.\nSubstituting $y=k$ and $x=h$ into this equation, we get $k=a(0)^2+k$, so $a=0$.\nTherefore, $a+b+c+d+e+f=2+1+h+k-0-0=\\boxed{h+k}$.\nThe answer is: h+k",
        "The reflection of a parabola across a horizontal line is another parabola with the same vertex and the same axis of symmetry.\nSince the vertex of the original parabola is $(h,k)$, the vertex of the reflected parabola is also $(h,k)$.\nThe axis of symmetry of the original parabola is the line $x=h$, so the axis of symmetry of the reflected parabola is also the line $x=h$.\nTo find the equations of the original and reflected parabolas, we can use the standard form $y=a(x-h)^2+k$.\nThe equation of the original parabola is $y=a(x-h)^2+k$.\nThe equation of the reflected parabola is $y=a(x-h)^2+k$.\nComparing these equations, we see that $a$ and $h$ remain the same after the reflection.\nThe value of $a+b+c+d+e+f$ is $a+b+c+a+h+k=2a+h+k$.\nSince the parabola is reflected across the line $y=k$, the value of $k$ remains the same after the reflection.\nTherefore, $2a+h+k=2a+h+k=2a+h+k=\\boxed{2a+h+k}$.The answer is: 2a+h+k",
        "When a parabola is reflected about the line $y=k$, the vertex is reflected to become the new vertex.\nSince the original parabola has vertex $(h,k)$, the reflected parabola will have vertex $(h,k)$.\nThe coefficient of $x^2$ in the equation of the reflected parabola will be the same as the coefficient of $x^2$ in the original parabola, which is $a$.\nThe coefficient of $x$ in the equation of the reflected parabola will be the negative of the coefficient of $x$ in the original parabola, which is $-b$.\nThe constant term in the equation of the reflected parabola will be the same as the constant term in the original parabola, which is $c$.\nTherefore, the equation of the reflected parabola is $y=a(x-h)^2-(bx+c)+k$, which simplifies to $y=ax^2+bx+c+k$.\nSo $d=a$, $e=b$, $f=c+k$, and $a+b+c+d+e+f=a+b+c+d+e+c+k=2a+2b+2c+k$.\nSince the vertex of the original parabola is $(h,k)$, the equation of the original parabola can be written as $y=a(x-h)^2+k$.\nExpanding, we get $y=ax^2-2ahx+ah^2+k$.\nComparing this with $y=ax^2+bx+c$, we have $b=-2ah$ and $c=ah^2+k$.\nTherefore, $2a+2b+2c+k=2a-4ah+2ah^2+2k$.\nSince this expression does not depend on the specific values of $h$ or $k$, the value of $a+b+c+d+e+f$ is $\\boxed{2}$.The answer is: 2",
        "When the parabola is reflected about the line $y=k$, the vertex of the new parabola is $(h, -k)$.\nThe equation of the new parabola is $y=a(x-h)^2 + k$.\nExpanding, we get $y = ax^2 + (2ah-k)x + (h^2 + k)$.\nComparing this with $y = dx^2 + ex + f$, we have:\n$a = d$\n$2ah - k = e$\n$h^2 + k = f$\nWe also know that the vertex of the new parabola is $(h, -k)$, so $h^2 + (-k) = f$.\nCombining these equations, we have $2ah - k = e$ and $h^2 - k = f$.\nFrom $2ah - k = e$, we have $a = \\frac{k - e}{2h}$.\nSubstituting this into $h^2 - k = f$, we have $\\frac{k^2 - (e + k)h}{h^2} = f$.\nMultiplying through by $h^2$, we have $k^2(h^2) - (e + k)(h^2) = fh^2$.\nSince $h^2$ divides both sides, we can divide by $h^2$ to get $k^2 - (e + k)h = fh$.\nExpanding, we have $k^2 - ek - kh = fh$.\nSince $k$ is common to both sides, we can combine like terms to get $k(h - e - k) = fh$.\nSince $h - e - k$ is common to both sides, we can divide by $h - e - k$ to get $k = \\frac{fh}{h - e - k}$.\nSubstituting this into $h^2 - k = f$, we have $h^2 - \\frac{fh}{h - e - k} = f$.\nMultiplying through by $h - e - k$, we have $h^3 - fh - (fh) = f(h - e - k)$.\nSimplifying, we have $h^3 - fh - fh = fh",
