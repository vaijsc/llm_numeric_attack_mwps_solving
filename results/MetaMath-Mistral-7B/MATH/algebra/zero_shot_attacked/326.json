        "We can write the given equations as $5^b=425$ and $3^b=27$.\nFrom the first equation, we can see that $b=2$.\nFrom the second equation, we can see that $b=3$.\nTherefore, the value of $c$ is $3^b=3^3=27$.The answer is: 27",
        "From the first equation, we have $425^b = 5$.\nSince $425 = 5^2 \\cdot 7$, we can rewrite the equation as $(5^2 \\cdot 7)^b = 5$.\nUsing the property of exponents that $(a^b)^c = a^{bc}$, we can simplify to $5^{2b} \\cdot 7^b = 5$.\nSince $5^1 = 5$, we must have $2b = 1$ and $7^b = 1$.\nTherefore, $b = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $7^b = 7^{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\sqrt{7}$.\nFrom the second equation, we have $27^b = c$.\nSince $27 = 3^3$, we can rewrite the equation as $(3^3)^b = c$.\nUsing the property of exponents again, we have $3^{3b} = c$.\nSince $3^1 = 3$, we must have $3b = 1$ and $c = 3^{\\frac{1}{3}}$.\nTherefore, $b = \\frac{1}{3}$ and $c = 3^{\\frac{1}{3}} = \\sqrt[3]{3}$.\nThe value of $c$ is $\\boxed{\\sqrt[3]{3}}$.The answer is: \\sqrt[3]{3}",
        "We can rewrite $425$ as $5^2 \\cdot 7$ and $27$ as $3^3$.\nSo, $425^b = (5^2 \\cdot 7)^b = 5^{2b} \\cdot 7^b$.\nSince $5^b = 1$, we have $425^b = 7^b$.\nTherefore, $c = 27^b = (3^3)^b = 3^{3b} = 7^b = \\boxed{7}$.The answer is: 7",
        "From $425^b=5$, we can rewrite this as $(5^2 \\cdot 7)^b=5$.\nUsing the property of exponents, we can decrease the exponent by one and move the base inside the parentheses:\n$5^{2b} \\cdot 7^b = 5$.\nSimilarly, from $27^b=c$, we can rewrite this as $(3^3)^b=c$.\nAgain, using the property of exponents, we can decrease the exponent by one and move the base inside the parentheses:\n$3^{3b}=c$.\nNow, looking at both equations, we can see that $2b=1$ and $3b=1$.\nSolving these two equations, we find that $b=1/2$ and $b=1/3$.\nHowever, since $b$ is the exponent, it must be a whole number.\nTherefore, the only possible value for $b$ is $b=1$.\nSubstituting this back into the first equation, we have $425^1=5$, which is true.\nSo, $b=1$ is the correct value.\nNow, substituting $b=1$ into the second equation, we have $27^1=c$, which simplifies to $27=c$.\nTherefore, the value of $c$ is $\\boxed{27}$.\nThe answer is: 27",
