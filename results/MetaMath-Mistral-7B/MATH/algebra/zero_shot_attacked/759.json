        "The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of $x$ in the polynomial.\n$f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 5, so the highest power of $x$ in $f(x)$ is $x^5$.\n$g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 2, so the highest power of $x$ in $g(x)$ is $x^2$.\nTo find the degree of $f(x) - g(x)$, we need to subtract the two polynomials.\n$(f(x) - g(x))$ is a polynomial, so we can add or subtract terms without changing the degree.\nWhen we subtract $g(x)$, the highest power of $x$ in the resulting polynomial will be the highest power of $x$ in $f(x)$ minus the highest power of $x$ in $g(x)$.\nSo, the degree of $f(x) - g(x)$ is $5 - 2 = \\boxed{3}$.\nThe answer is: 3",
