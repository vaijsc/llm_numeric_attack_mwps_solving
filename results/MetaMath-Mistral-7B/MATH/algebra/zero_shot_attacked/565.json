        "We can set up a proportion to find the height of the pine tree.\nThe ratio of Monica's height to her shadow is $5/3$.\nThe ratio of the pine tree's height to its shadow is $x/34$, where $x$ is the height of the pine tree.\nSetting up the proportion $\\frac{5}{3} = \\frac{x}{34}$, we can cross-multiply to get $5 \\cdot 34 = 3 \\cdot x$.\nSimplifying, we find $170 = 3x$, so $x = \\frac{170}{3}$.\nTherefore, the height of the pine tree is $\\frac{170}{3}$ feet.\nThe answer is: 56.67",
        "We can set up a proportion to solve this problem.\nLet the height of the pine tree be $h$ feet.\nWe can set up the proportion: $\\frac{h}{34} = \\frac{5}{3}$.\nCross-multiplying, we have $3h = 34 \\cdot 5$.\nSimplifying, we find $h = \\frac{34 \\cdot 5}{3} = \\frac{170}{3} = \\boxed{56.67}$.\nThe answer is: 56.67",
        "We can set up a proportion to solve for the height of the pine tree.\nThe ratio of Monica's height to Monica's shadow length is the same as the ratio of the height of the pine tree to the shadow length of the pine tree.\nSo, we have the proportion:\n5 feet / 3 feet = x feet / 34 feet\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n5 * 34 = 3 * x\n170 = 3x\nDividing both sides by 3, we get:\nx = 56.67\nRounding to the nearest whole number, the height of the pine tree is \\boxed{57} feet.The answer is: 57",
        "The height of the pine tree is the same as the height of Monica divided by the ratio of their shadows.\nSo, the height of the pine tree is $5/3$ times the length of Monica's shadow.\nSince Monica's shadow is 3 feet long, the height of the pine tree is $5/3 \\times 3 = \\boxed{5}$ feet.\nThe answer is: 5",
        "\nWe can set up a proportion to solve this problem.\nThe height of Monica is 5 feet and her shadow is 3 feet long.\nThe height of the pine tree is x feet and its shadow is 34 feet long.\nWe can set up the proportion:\n5/3 = x/34\nCross multiplying, we get:\n3x = 5 * 34\n3x = 170\nDividing by 3, we find:\nx = 170/3\nThe height of the pine tree is approximately 56.67 feet.\nSo, the pine tree is approximately 57 feet tall.The answer is: 57",
        "We can set up a proportion to solve for the height of the pine tree.\nThe height of the tree is to its shadow as Monica's height is to her shadow.\nSo, we have the proportion: \nTree height / Tree shadow = Monica\u2019s height / Monica\u2019s shadow\nLet's substitute the given values into the proportion:\nTree height / 34 = 5/3\nTo solve for the height of the tree, we cross multiply:\nTree height = (5/3) * 34\nTree height = 5 * 11.33\nTree height = 56.66 feet\nTherefore, the height of the pine tree is approximately 57 feet.The answer is: 57",
        "We can set up a proportion to solve for the height of the pine tree.\nSince Monica's shadow is 3 feet and the pine tree's shadow is 34 feet,\nwe can set up the proportion $\\frac{3}{5} = \\frac{x}{34}$,\nwhere $x$ represents the height of the pine tree.\nCross-multiplying, we have $3\\cdot 34 = 5\\cdot x$,\nor $102 = 5x$.\nDividing both sides by 5, we find that $x = \\boxed{20}$.\nThe answer is: 20",
        "We can set up a proportion to solve this problem.\nThe ratio of Monica's height to her shadow is 5/3.\nThe ratio of the pine tree's height to its shadow is the unknown variable we are trying to find, let's call it x.\nSo, we have the equation 5/3 = x/34.\nTo solve for x, we can cross multiply: 5 * 34 = 3 * x.\nThis simplifies to 170 = 3x.\nDividing both sides by 3, we find x = 56.67.\nSince the height of the pine tree cannot be a decimal, we can round the answer to the nearest whole number.\nTherefore, the pine tree is approximately 57 feet tall.The answer is: 57",
        "The ratio of Monica's height to her shadow is 5 feet : 3 feet.\nThe ratio of the pine tree's height to its shadow is x : 34 feet.\nSince the ratios are equal, we can set up the equation:\n5 feet / 3 feet = x feet / 34 feet\nCross multiplying, we have:\n5 feet * 34 feet = 3 feet * x feet\n170 feet = 3x feet\nDividing both sides by 3, we get:\nx = 170 feet / 3 feet\nx = 56.67 feet\nRounding to the nearest foot, the height of the pine tree is 57 feet.\nThe answer is: 57",
        "We can set up a proportion to solve for the height of the pine tree. Let's call the height of the pine tree H.
