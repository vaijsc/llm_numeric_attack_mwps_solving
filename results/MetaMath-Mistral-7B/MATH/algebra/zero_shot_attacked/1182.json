        "The formula for calculating the amount of money at a future date is $A = P\\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt}$,\nwhere $A$ is the final amount, $P$ is the principal (the initial amount), $r$ is the interest rate (expressed as a decimal), $n$ is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and $t$ is the number of years.\nIn this case, Frederick's grandparents gave him a gift of $\\$2100$, so $P = 2100$.\nThe interest rate is $5\\%$, so $r = 0.05$.\nThe money is invested for $10$ years, so $t = 10$.\nWe are interested in the final amount when Frederick can collect the money at the age of $18$, so $t = 18 - 10 = 8$.\nSince the money is invested at a simple interest rate, $n = 1$ (interest is compounded annually).\nSubstituting these values into the formula, we have $A = 2100\\left(1 + 0.05\\right)^{1\\cdot 8}$.\nCalculating, we find $A \\approx 3003.05$.\nTherefore, Frederick will have $\\boxed{\\$3003}$ when he can collect the money at the age of $18$.The answer is: 3003",
