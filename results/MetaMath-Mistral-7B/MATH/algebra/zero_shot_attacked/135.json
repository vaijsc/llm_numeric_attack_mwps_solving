        "We know that lines that are parallel have the same slope.\nSo, the slope of the line parallel to $3x-7y=65$ is the same as the slope of this line.\nWe can rewrite the equation $3x-7y=65$ in slope-intercept form $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope.\nRearranging the equation, we have $y = \\frac{3}{7}x - \\frac{65}{7}$.\nThe slope of the line is $\\frac{3}{7}$.\nNow, let's find the equation of the line passing through $(7,5)$ and $(0,K)$.\nUsing the point-slope form of a line, we have $y-5 = \\frac{3}{7}(x-7)$.\nSubstituting $(x,y) = (0,K)$, we have $K-5 = \\frac{3}{7}(0-7)$.\nSimplifying, we get $K-5 = -\\frac{21}{7}$.\nMultiplying both sides by $7$, we have $7K-35 = -21$.\nAdding $35$ to both sides, we get $7K = 14$.\nDividing both sides by $7$, we find $K = \\boxed{2}$.\nThe answer is: 2",
