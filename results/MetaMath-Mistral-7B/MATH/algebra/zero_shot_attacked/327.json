        "The degree of a polynomial is determined by the term with the highest power of $t$.\nIf $p(t)$ is a seventh-degree polynomial and $q(t)$ is also a seventh-degree polynomial,\nthen when we multiply them together, we will get terms with powers of $t$ ranging from $0$ to $2 \\times 7 = 14$.\nTherefore, the degree of $p(t) \\cdot q(t)$ is $\\boxed{14}$.\nThe answer is: 14",
        "To find the degree of a polynomial, we need to determine the highest power of $t$ that appears in the polynomial.\nIf $p(t)$ and $q(t)$ are both seventh-degree polynomials, then they have the form:\n$p(t) = at^7 + bt^6 + ct^5 + dt^4 + et^3 + ft^2 + gt^1 + ht^0$\n$q(t) = mt^7 + nt^6 + ont^5 + vt^4 + vt^3 + pnt^2 + gt^1 + ht^0$\nWhen we multiply these two polynomials together, we will get a new polynomial of the form:\n$p(t) \\cdot q(t) = (at^7 + bt^6 + ct^5 + dt^4 + et^3 + ft^2 + gt^1 + ht^0) \\cdot (mt^7 + nt^6 + ont^5 + vt^4 + vt^3 + pnt^2 + gt^1 + ht^0)$\nTo find the degree of $p(t) \\cdot q(t)$, we need to determine the highest power of $t$ that appears in this product.\nThe highest power of $t$ that appears in the first polynomial is $t^7$, and the highest power of $t$ that appears in the second polynomial is also $t^7$.\nWhen we multiply these two polynomials together, the highest power of $t$ that appears in the product will be the sum of the highest powers of $t$ in each polynomial, which is $7 + 7 = 14$.\nTherefore, the degree of $p(t) \\cdot q(t)$ is $\\boxed{14}$.\nThe answer is: 14",
        "The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of the variable.\nIf $p(t)$ is a seventh-degree polynomial, it means that the highest power of $t$ in $p(t)$ is 7.\nSimilarly, if $q(t)$ is a seventh-degree polynomial, the highest power of $t$ in $q(t)$ is 7.\nWhen we multiply $p(t)$ and $q(t)$, the highest power of $t$ will be the sum of the highest powers of $t$ in $p(t)$ and $q(t)$.\nTherefore, the degree of $p(t)\\cdot q(t)$ is $7+7=\\boxed{14}$.\nThe answer is: 14",
