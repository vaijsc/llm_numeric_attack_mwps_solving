        "\nThe line $y=4x+6$ is a line with a slope of 4 and a y-intercept of 6.\nIf we want a line parallel to this line, it will have the same slope of 4.\nTo find the equation of the parallel line, we can use the point-slope form of a line, which is $y-y_1=m(x-x_1)$, where $(x_1, y_1)$ is a point on the line and $m$ is the slope.\nUsing the point $(3,12)$, we have $y-12=4(x-3)$.\nSimplifying, we get $y-12=4x-12$, or $y=4x$.\nThe y-coordinate of the point where this line crosses the y-axis is the y-intercept of the line.\nSince the line has the equation $y=4x$, the y-intercept is $\\boxed{0}$.The answer is: 0",
