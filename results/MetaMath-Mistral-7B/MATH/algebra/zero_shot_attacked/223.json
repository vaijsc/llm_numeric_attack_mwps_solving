        "We can rewrite $81$ as $3^4$, so the equation becomes $\\frac{9^n\\cdot3^{2n+1}}{3^4}=543$.\nSimplifying the left side, we have $\\frac{3^{n+2\\cdot n+1}}{3^4}=543$.\nUsing the rule of exponents, we can subtract the exponents, giving $\\frac{3^{n+2\\cdot n+1-4}}{1}=543$.\nSimplifying further, we have $3^{n+2\\cdot n+1-4}=543$.\nCombining like terms, we get $3^{3n-3}=543$.\nSince $3^{3n-3}$ is equal to $543$, we can rewrite $543$ as $3^5$.\nSo, $3^{3n-3}=3^5$.\nSetting the exponents equal to each other, we have $3n-3=5$.\nSolving for $n$, we find $n=3$.\nTherefore, the value of $n$ is $\\boxed{3}$.\nThe answer is: 3",
        "\nFirst, we can simplify the equation by factoring out a 9 from the numerator and an 81 from the denominator:\n$$\\frac{9^n\\cdot3^{2n+1}}{81} = \\frac{(9^2)^{n/2}\\cdot3^{2n+1}}{3^4} = \\frac{3^{3n/2}\\cdot3^{2n+1}}{3^4} = 3^{(3n/2 + 2n + 1 - 4)} = 3^{(3n/2 + 2n - 3)} = 3^{5n/2 - 3}.$$\nNow we have an equation with only one variable, $n$. We need to find the value of $n$ that satisfies this equation when set equal to 543.\nWe can write $543$ as $3^1 \\cdot 3^7$, since $543 = 3 \\cdot 3^7$. So we have $3^{5n/2 - 3} = 3^1 \\cdot 3^7$.\nSince the bases are the same, we can set the exponents equal to each other: $5n/2 - 3 = 1 + 7$.\nSimplifying this equation, we have $5n/2 - 3 = 8$.\nAdding 3 to both sides, we get $5n/2 = 11$.\nMultiplying both sides by 2/5, we find $n = \\boxed{4}$.\nThe answer is: 4",
        "We can rewrite $543$ as $3^5$ and simplify the equation as $\\frac{9^n\\cdot3^{2n+1}}{81}=3^5$.\nCancelling out $3^{2n+1}$ on both sides, we have $\\frac{9^n}{81}=3^4$.\nMultiplying both sides by $81$, we get $9^n=3^8$.\nSince $9=3^2$, we can rewrite the equation as $(3^2)^n=3^8$.\nTherefore, $n=\\boxed{4}$.\nThe answer is: 4",
        "First, we can simplify the right side of the equation.\nThirty-seven is equal to $3^2\\cdot3^3$, so we can rewrite the equation as $\\frac{9^n\\cdot3^{2n+1}}{81}=\\frac{3^{2+3}}{3^4}$.\nThis gives us $9^n\\cdot3^{2n+1}=3^2$.\nWe can combine the exponents on the left side to $9^n\\cdot3^{2n+1}=3^{2+1}$.\nNow we can equate the exponents by setting the powers of 3 equal to each other.\nWe have $9^n=3^2$, so $3^n=3^2$.\nSince the bases are equal, we can conclude that $n=2$.\nTherefore, the value of $n$ is $\\boxed{2}$.\nThe answer is: 2",
