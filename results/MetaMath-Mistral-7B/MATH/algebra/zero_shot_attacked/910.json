        "We are given that the 7th term is 30 and the 11th term is 60.\nSince this is an arithmetic sequence, we can find the common difference, d, by subtracting the 7th term from the 11th term:\n60 - 30 = 30\nSo the common difference is 30.\nTo find the nth term of an arithmetic sequence, we can use the formula:\nnth term = first term + (n-1) * common difference\nWe are given that the 7th term is 30, so the first term is 30.\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n71st term = 30 + (71-1) * 30\n= 30 + 70 * 30\n= 30 + 2100\n= 2130\nTherefore, the 71st term of this sequence is $\\boxed{2130}$.The answer is: 2130",
        "Hold on a second, an arithmetic sequence is a sequence in which the difference between consecutive terms is constant.\nSo, if the 7th term is 30, and the 11th term is 60, we can find the common difference by subtracting the 7th term from the 11th term: $60 - 30 = 30$.\nNow we know that the common difference is 30.\nTo find the 71st term, we can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$, where $a_n$ is the nth term, $a_1$ is the first term, $n$ is the position of the term, and $d$ is the common difference.\nIn this case, $a_1$ is the 7th term, which is 30. So, $a_1 = 30$.\n$n$ is the position of the 71st term, so $n = 71$.\nTherefore, the 71st term is $a_{71} = 30 + (71-1)(30) = 30 + 70(30) = 30 + 2100 = \\boxed{2130}$.\nThe answer is: 2130",
