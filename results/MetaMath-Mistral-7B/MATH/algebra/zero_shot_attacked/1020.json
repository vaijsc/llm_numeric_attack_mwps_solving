        "The expression (x-6)(x+6) will be negative when exactly one of the factors is negative.\nIf x-6 is negative, then x must be less than 6.\nIf x+6 is negative, then x must be less than -6.\nTherefore, the smallest integer that satisfies the inequality is $\\boxed{-7}$.\nThe answer is: -7",
        "We can expand the inequality to get $x^2 - 36 < 0$.\nNext, we can factor the quadratic to get $(x-6)(x+6) < 0$.\nThe product of two numbers is negative if and only if one number is positive and the other is negative.\nIn this case, one factor is positive (x-6) and the other factor is negative (x+6).\nTo satisfy the inequality, we need one factor to be positive and the other factor to be negative.\nThis occurs when $-6 < x < 6$.\nThe smallest integer that satisfies this inequality is $\\boxed{-5}$.\nThe answer is: -5",
        "The inequality can be rewritten as $(x-6)(x+6)<0$.\nWe can solve this inequality by considering the sign of each factor:\nWhen $x<-6$, both factors are negative, so the product is positive.\nWhen $-6<x<6$, the factor $(x-6)$ is negative and the factor $(x+6)$ is positive, so the product is negative.\nWhen $x>6$, both factors are positive, so the product is positive.\nTherefore, the solution to the inequality is $-6<x<6$.\nThe smallest integer satisfying this inequality is $\\boxed{-5}$.\nThe answer is: -5",
        "We can solve this inequality by finding the values of $x$ that make $(x-6)(x+6)$ negative.\nIf we expand $(x-6)(x+6)$, we get $x^2 - 36$.\nTo find when $x^2 - 36$ is negative, we look at the graph of a quadratic function $y = x^2$.\nThe graph of $y = x^2$ is a parabola that opens upwards, with the vertex at the point $(0, 0)$.\nSince the coefficient of $x^2$ is positive, the parabola is concave up.\nTherefore, the values of $x$ that make $x^2 - 36$ negative are the values between $-6$ and $6$, exclusive.\nThe smallest possible integer that satisfies this inequality is $\\boxed{-5}$.The answer is: -5",
        "The inequality $(x-6)(x+6)<0$ is satisfied when one of the factors is positive and the other is negative. \nThe solutions to $x-6<0$ are $x<6$, and the solutions to $x+6<0$ are $x<-6$. \nTherefore, the values of $x$ that satisfy the inequality are $-6<x<6$. \nThe smallest integer that satisfies this inequality is $\\boxed{-5}$. \nThe answer is: -5",
        "We need to find the values of $x$ for which the expression $(x-6)(x+6)$ is less than 0.\nThis expression is the product of two factors, $(x-6)$ and $(x+6)$.\nWe can create a sign chart to determine the intervals where the expression is negative:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c}\n& x<-6 & -6<x<6 & x>6 \\\\ \\hline\nx-6 & - & + & - \\\\\nx+6 & - & + & - \\\\\n(x-6)(x+6) & + & - & +\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nFrom the sign chart, we can see that the expression $(x-6)(x+6)$ is negative for $x$ in the interval $(-6,6)$.\nTherefore, the smallest integer that satisfies the inequality is $\\boxed{-5}$.\nThe answer is: -5",
        "The inequality (x-6)(x+6)<0 represents the product of two factors whose product is negative.\nThis occurs when one factor is positive and the other is negative.\nSetting each factor equal to zero, we find the critical points x=6 and x=-6.\nSince the inequality is written as (x-6)(x+6)<0, we can use a sign chart to determine the intervals where the expression is less than zero.\nThe chart looks like this:\n|  | (x-6)(x+6) |\n| x<-6 | negative |\n| -6<x<6 | positive |\n| x>6 | negative |\nFrom the chart, we can see that the expression (x-6)(x+6) is less than zero when -6<x<6.\nThe smallest integer that satisfies this inequality is $\\boxed{-5}$.\nThe answer is: -5",
        "We can factor the inequality as $(x-6)(x+6)<0$.\nWe know that the product of two numbers is negative if and only if one number is negative and the other is positive.\nSo, we can set up the following system of equations:\n$x-6<0$ and $x+6>0$.\nSolving the inequalities, we find that $-6<x<6$.\nTherefore, the smallest integer that satisfies the inequality is $\\boxed{-5}$.The answer is: -5",
        "First, we factor the expression (x-6)(x+6).\nThis gives us (x^2-36).\nNow, we need to find the values of x that make this expression less than 0.\nSince the square of any real number is nonnegative, the only way for this expression to be less than 0 is if x is between -6 and 6, but not equal to -6 or 6.\nTherefore, the smallest integer that satisfies the inequality is $\\boxed{-5}$.\nThe answer is: -5",

        "First, we can expand the expression (x-6)(x+6) as x^2 - 36.\nWe want to find the smallest integer that satisfies the inequality x^2 - 36 < 0.\nSimplifying further, we rewrite the inequality as x^2 < 36.\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get |x| < 6.\nDuring the square root operation, we need to consider both the positive and negative square root, as the inequality is not specified to be one-sided.\nSo, we have two cases to consider:\nCase 1: x > 0\nIn this case, the expression simplifies to x < 6.\nThe smallest integer that satisfies this inequality is 5.\nCase 2: x < 0\nIn this case, the expression simplifies to -x < 6.\nMultiplying both sides by -1, we get x > -6.\nThe smallest integer that satisfies this inequality is -5.\nThe smallest integer that satisfies the inequality (x-6)(x+6) < 0 is -5.\nThe answer is: -5",

        "We can solve the inequality by considering the sign of each factor.\nThe inequality will hold true when one factor is positive and the other is negative, or when both factors are negative.\nWhen $x-6<0$ and $x+6>0$, we have $x<6<0$, which is not possible.\nWhen $x-6>0$ and $x+6<0$, we have $6<x<-6$, which does not include any integers.\nWhen $x-6<0$ and $x+6<0$, we have $x<6$ and $x<-6$, which gives us $x<-6$.\nTherefore, the smallest integer that satisfies the inequality is $\\boxed{-7}$.\nThe answer is: -7",
