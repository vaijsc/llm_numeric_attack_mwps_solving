        "We know that each clown has 2 legs and 1 head, and each horse has 4 legs and 1 head.\nWe counted 30 legs, so there must be $\\frac{30}{4} = 7.5$ horses.\nWe also counted 20 heads, so there must be $\\frac{20}{1} = 20$ heads in total.\nSince each horse has 1 head and each clown has 1 head, the number of heads must be equal to the number of horses plus the number of clowns.\nTherefore, there must be $20 - 20 = 0$ clowns.\nSince there are no clowns, there must be $20$ horses in the parade.\nThe answer is: 20",
        "We know that each horse has 4 legs and each clown has 2 legs.\nWe also know that each horse has 2 heads and each clown has 1 head.\nLet's count the total number of legs and heads and see if we can figure out how many horses and clowns there are.\nLet's start with the count of legs:\n30 legs in total\nFor each horse, there are 4 legs, so the number of horses is 30 legs / 4 legs per horse = 7.5 horses\nSince we can't have half a horse, we know that the number of horses must be a whole number.\nTherefore, there must be 7 horses.\nNow let's count the heads:\n20 heads in total\nFor each horse, there are 2 heads, so the number of horses is 20 heads / 2 heads per horse = 10 horses\nSince we already know that there are 7 horses, we know that this count is incorrect.\nTherefore, there must be more than 10 horses.\nCombining the two counts, we can conclude that there must be 7 horses.\nThe answer is: 7",
        "each clown has 2 legs, and horses have 4 legs.\nLet's represent the number of clowns as C and the number of horses as H.\nWe can set up the equation: C * 2 legs + H * 4 legs = Total number of legs.\nSo we have 2C + 4H = 30 legs.\nWe also know that there are C heads and H heads for clowns and horses.\nWe can set up another equation: C heads + H heads = Total number of heads.\nSo we have C + H = 20 heads.\nNow we have a system of equations: 2C + 4H = 30 legs, C + H = 20 heads.\nWe can solve this system of equations to find the number of horses (H).\nLet's multiply the second equation by 2 to eliminate C in the system: 2C + 2H = 40 heads.\nNow we can subtract the first equation from the second equation: (2C + 2H) - (2C + 4H) = 40 heads - 30 legs.\nThis simplifies to -2H = 10 heads, or H = -5 heads/2.\nSince we can't have a negative number of horses, we can discard this solution.\nTherefore, there must be an error in the problem statement or our calculations.\nPlease provide additional information or clarify the problem.\n#### 2#### 2\nThe answer is: 2",
        "Each clown has 2 legs, so the number of legs from clowns is 2*number of clowns.\nEach horse has 4 legs, so the number of legs from horses is 4*number of horses.\nThe total number of legs is 2*number of clowns + 4*number of horses.\nSince we know the total number of legs is 30, we can set up the equation: 2*number of clowns + 4*number of horses = 30.\nLet\u2019s solve for the number of horses.\nFirst, subtract 2*number of clowns from both sides of the equation: 4*number of horses = 30 - 2*number of clowns.\nNext, divide both sides of the equation by 4: number of horses = (30 - 2*number of clowns)/4.\nSince we don\u2019t know the number of clowns, we can\u2019t solve for the exact number of horses.\nHowever, we can make an estimation.\nIf we assume there are 5 clowns (which is a reasonable assumption), we can substitute it into the equation: number of horses = (30 - 2*5)/4 = 30/4 = 7.5.\nSince we can't have a fraction of a horse, we round down to the nearest whole number.\nTherefore, we saw approximately 7 horses in the parade.\nThe answer is: 7",
        "Each person has 2 legs, so the number of people is 30 legs / 2 legs per person = 15 people.\nEach horse has 4 legs, so the number of horses is 30 legs - (15 people * 2 legs per person) = 30 legs - 30 legs = 0 horses.\nTherefore, you did not see any horses in the parade.\n#### 0#### 0\nThe answer is: 0",
