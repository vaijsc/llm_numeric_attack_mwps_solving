        "Let the two numbers be $x$ and $y$.\nFrom the given information, we have the following equations:\n$x + y = 70$ and $x - y = 12$.\nWe can solve this system of equations by adding the two equations together:\n$(x + y) + (x - y) = 70 + 12$.\nSimplifying, we get $2x = 82$, which means $x = 41$.\nPlugging this value back into one of the original equations, we find that $y = 29$.\nTherefore, the product of the two numbers is $x \\cdot y = 41 \\cdot 29 = \\boxed{1199}$.\nThe answer is: 1199",
