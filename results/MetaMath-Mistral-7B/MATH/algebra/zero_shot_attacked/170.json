        "ctions $y=14f(12x)$.\nThis means that if $(x,y)$ is a point on the graph of $y=f(x)$, then $(12x,14y)$ is a point on the graph of $y=14f(12x)$.\nSince the point $(8,9)$ is on the graph of $y=14f(12x)$, we know that $(12(8),14(9))=(96,126)$ is a point on the graph of $y=f(x)$.\nTherefore, the sum of the coordinates of the point $(96,126)$ is $\\boxed{222}$.The answer is: 222",
        "\nSince the point (8,9) is on the graph of y=14f(12x), we know that 14f(12x) evaluates to 9 when x is equal to 8 divided by 12, which is 2/3.\nSo we have 14f(2/3) = 9.\nTo find the point on the graph of y=f(x), we need to solve for x.\nFirst, we divide both sides of the equation by 14 to get f(2/3) = 9/14.\nNext, we need to find the value of x when f(x) is equal to 9/14. Let's call this x1.\nSo we have f(x1) = 9/14.\nSince we have the equation y=14f(12x), we can write y=14f(12x) = 14f(x1) = 14(9/14) = 9.\nTherefore, the point on the graph of y=f(x) is (x1, 9).\nTo find the sum of the coordinates of this point, we need to find the value of x1.\nTo do that, we need to solve the equation f(x1) = 9/14. However, without the specific form of the function f(x), we cannot find the exact value of x1.\nTherefore, we cannot determine the sum of the coordinates of the point on the graph of y=f(x).\nThe answer is: 9",
