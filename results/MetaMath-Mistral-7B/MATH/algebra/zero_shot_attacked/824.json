        "We can rewrite 425 as $(500-75)$.\nThen, using the difference of squares, we have $(500-75)^2 = 500^2 - 2(500)(75) + 75^2$.\nWe can calculate the squares of 500 and 75 mentally, or look them up if necessary.\n$500^2 = 250000$ and $75^2 = 5625$.\nThe middle term, $-2(500)(75)$ can be simplified to $-75000$.\nTherefore, $425^2 = 250000 - 75000 + 5625 = \\boxed{176250}$.The answer is: 176250",
