        "The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of the variable that appears in the polynomial.\nFor a polynomial of degree $n$, the highest power of $x$ is $x^n$.\nSince $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 4, the highest power of $x$ in $f(x)$ is $x^4$.\nSimilarly, since $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 6, the highest power of $x$ in $g(x)$ is $x^6$.\nNow, when we add two polynomials, the highest power of $x$ in the sum will be the maximum of the highest powers of $x$ in the two polynomials.\nTherefore, the degree of $3f(x) + 2g(x)$ will be $\\max(4, 6) = \\boxed{6}$.\nThe answer is: 6",
