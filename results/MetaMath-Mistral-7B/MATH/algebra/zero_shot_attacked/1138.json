        "Since the graph passes through $(1,5)$ and $(1,10)$, the equation of the graph must be of the form $y=a(x-1)^2+5$ or $y=a(x-1)^2+10$.\nPlugging in the coordinates of $(2,19)$, we can solve for $a$.\nUsing $y=a(x-1)^2+5$, we get $19=a(2-1)^2+5$, which simplifies to $19=a+5$.\nSo $a=14$.\nTherefore, the equation of the graph is $y=14(x-1)^2+5$.\nExpanding, we get $y=14x^2-28x+19$.\nThus, $a+b+c=14+(-28+19)=\\boxed{-5}$.\nThe answer is: -5",
