        "Let $x$ be the number of games we won and $y$ be the number of games we lost.\nAccording to the information given, we have the following equations:\n\\[\\frac{2}{9}x = x - y - 45\\]\n\\[\\frac{7}{9}x + y = x - y - 45\\]\n\\[\\frac{2}{9}x - \\frac{7}{9}x = -y - 45\\]\n\\[-\\frac{5}{9}x = -y - 45\\]\n\\[y = \\frac{5}{9}x + 45\\]\nSubstituting this expression for $y$ into the first equation, we get:\n\\[\\frac{2}{9}x = x - \\left(\\frac{5}{9}x + 45\\right)\\]\n\\[\\frac{2}{9}x = x - \\frac{5}{9}x - 45\\]\n\\[\\frac{4}{9}x = 45\\]\n\\[x = \\frac{9}{4} \\cdot 45\\]\n\\[x = 67.5\\]\nSince $x$ represents the number of games we won, we can conclude that we played $\\boxed{67.5}$ games this year.\nThe answer is: 67.5",
        "If the team won $2/9$ of its games, then it lost $1 - 2/9 = 7/9$ of its games.\nIf we lost $45$ more games than we won, then we won $x$ games and lost $x + 45$ games.\nSince the total number of games played is the sum of games won and games lost, we have the equation $x + (x + 45) = \\text{total number of games}$.\nSimplifying the equation, we get $2x + 45 = \\text{total number of games}$.\nSince we already know that $2/9$ of the games were won, we can set up the equation $\\frac{2}{9} \\times \\text{total number of games} = x$.\nSimplifying the equation, we get $\\frac{2}{9} \\times \\text{total number of games} = x$.\nSubstituting $x$ in the equation $2x + 45 = \\text{total number of games}$, we get $2(\\frac{2}{9} \\times \\text{total number of games}) + 45 = \\text{total number of games}$.\nSimplifying the equation, we get $\\frac{4}{9} \\times \\text{total number of games} + 45 = \\text{total number of games}$.\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by $9/4$, we get $9 \\times (\\frac{4}{9} \\times \\text{total number of games}) + 9 \\times 45 = 9 \\times \\text{total number of games}$.\nSimplifying the equation, we get $\\text{total number of games} + 225 = 9 \\times \\text{total number of games}$.\nSubtracting $\\text{total number of games}$ from both sides of the equation, we get $225 = 8 \\times \\text{total number of games}$.\nDividing both sides of the equation by $8$, we get $\\text{total number of games} = \\frac{225}{8}$.\nSimplifying the equation, we get $\\text{total number of games} = 27\\frac{3}{8}$.\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a game, we round up to the",
        "If the team won $2/9$ of its games, then it lost $1 - 2/9 = 7/9$ of its games.\nSince we lost 45 more games than we won, we lost $2/9 + 45$ games.\nWe can set up the equation $(7/9)(x) = (2/9)(x) + 45$, where $x$ is the total number of games played.\nSimplifying this equation, we get $(7/9)(x) = (2/9)(x) + 45$.\nMultiplying both sides by $9/7$, we get $x = (2/7)(x) + 45(9/7)$.\nSimplifying, we have $x = 2x/7 + 45(3/7)$.\nMultiplying both sides by $7$, we get $7x = 2x + 45(3)$.\nSubtracting $2x$ from both sides, we have $5x = 45(3)$.\nDividing both sides by $5$, we get $x = 45(3)/5$.\nSimplifying, we have $x = \\boxed{27}$.\nThe answer is: 27",
        "We know that the team won $2/9$ of its games.\nThis means that the team lost $1-2/9=7/9$ of its games.\nIf we lost 45 more games than we won, this means that the number of games we won is $7/9-45$.\nTo find the total number of games played, we can set up the equation $x=\\text{won games}+45+\\text{lost games}$, where $x$ is the total number of games played.\nSubstituting in the values we know, we get $x=(7/9-45)+\\text{lost games}$.\nTo find the total number of games played, we need to find the value of $x$.\nSimplifying the expression, we get $x=(7/9-45)+(7/9)=(7-45)/9+7/9=-38/9+7/9=-31/9$.\nTherefore, the team played $\\boxed{31}$ games this year.The answer is: 31",
        "We know that $\\frac{2}{9}$ of the team's games were won, so the remaining $\\frac{1}{9}$ of the games were lost.\nIf we lost 45 more games than we won, then the number of lost games can be expressed as $\\frac{1}{9}(x+45)$, where $x$ is the number of games won.\nSince $\\frac{1}{9}$ of the games were lost, the number of won games is $\\frac{2}{9}$ of the total number of games.\nLet's set up an equation using the information given:\n$\\frac{2}{9}(x) = x$\nSimplifying, we find that $x = 9$.\nTherefore, the total number of games played this year is $9 + 9 + 45 = \\boxed{63}$.\nThe answer is: 63",
        "Since we won $2/9$ of our games, we lost $1 - 2/9 = 7/9$ of our games.\nWe lost 45 more games than we won, so we lost $2/9 + 45$ games.\nThis means we won $2/9 - 45$ games.\nLet's call the total number of games we played this year $x$.\nThen, we have the equation $2/9 \\cdot x + 7/9 \\cdot x = x - 45$.\nCombining like terms, we have $(2/9 + 7/9) \\cdot x = x - 45$.\nSimplifying, we have $9/9 \\cdot x = x - 45$.\nTaking away $x$ from both sides, we have $9/9 \\cdot x - x = -45$.\nSimplifying further, we have $-x/9 = -45$.\nMultiplying both sides by $-9$, we have $x = 405$.\nTherefore, we played $\\boxed{405}$ games this year.The answer is: 405",

        "If the team won $2/9$ of its games, then it lost $1 - 2/9 = 7/9$ of its games.\nLet's say the team won $x$ games and lost $y$ games.\nWe are given that $x + y = 45$ more games than the team won.\nSo, $x + y = x + 45$.\nSubtracting $x$ from both sides, we have $y = 45$.\nSince the team won $x$ games, $x = 2/9$ of the total games played.\nLet's call the total number of games played $n$.\nThen, $x = 2/9 \\cdot n$.\nWe can set up the equation $\\frac{2}{9}n = y + 45$.\nSubstituting $y = 45$, we have $\\frac{2}{9}n = 45 + 45$.\nSimplifying, $\\frac{2}{9}n = 90$.\nMultiplying both sides by $\\frac{9}{2}$, we get $n = 225$.\nTherefore, the team played $\\boxed{225}$ games this year.The answer is: 225",
        "Let $x$ be the number of games we won.\nThen we lost $x + 45$ games.\nWe know that $\\frac{2}{9}$ of the games were won, so we have the equation $\\frac{2}{9}x + \\frac{2}{9}(x + 45) = 1$.\nSimplifying, we get $\\frac{2}{9}x + \\frac{2}{9}x + \\frac{2}{9} \\cdot 45 = 1$,\nwhich simplifies to $\\frac{2x + 2 \\cdot 45}{9} = 1$.\nMultiplying both sides by 9, we get $2x + 90 = 9$,\nand then subtracting 90 from both sides, we get $2x = -81$.\nDividing both sides by 2, we find that $x = -40.5$.\nHowever, since we can't have a fraction of a game, we round this down to the nearest whole number.\nTherefore, we won 40 games and lost 40 + 45 = 85 games.\nWe played a total of 40 + 85 = $\\boxed{125}$ games this year.The answer is: 125",

        "If we won $2/9$ of our games, that means we lost $1 - 2/9 = 7/9$ of our games.\nLet's assume we won $x$ games. Then we lost $x + 45$ games.\nThe total number of games we played is $x + (x + 45) = 2x + 45$.\nWe know that the winner of a game receives 1 point and the loser receives 0 points, so the total number of points we earned is $2x$.\nThe total number of points we lost is $1 \\cdot (x + 45) = x + 45$.\nSince the total number of points we earned is equal to the total number of points we lost, we have $2x = x + 45$.\nSimplifying, we find $x = 45$.\nSo we won 45 games and lost $45 + 45 = 90$ games.\nTherefore, we played a total of $45 + 90 = \\boxed{135}$ games.
