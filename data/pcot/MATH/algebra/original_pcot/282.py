# Let the degree of g(x) be represented as degree_g
# The maximum degree from the composition f(g(x)) gives degree_f * degree_g
# The total degree h(x) is the maximum of degree_f * degree_g and degree_g
# This leads us to the equation: degree_h = max(degree_f * degree_g, degree_g)
# Letâ€™s denote degree_g as an unknown variable for our calculations, we rearrange to form
# degree_h = degree_f * degree_g when degree_f * degree_g >= degree_g
# Calculate degree_g from the equation degree_h = degree_f * degree_g
# degree_h / degree_f = degree_g
