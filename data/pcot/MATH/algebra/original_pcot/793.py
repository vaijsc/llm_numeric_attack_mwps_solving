# Define the time elapsed in hours since Sphere was started growing
# This is what we need to find.
# Let x be the hours ago she started growing Sphere.
# At 8 p.m., the population of Rod is population_rod * (2 ** (hours_rod + x))
# At 8 p.m., the population of Sphere is population_sphere * (4 ** x)
# Set the populations equal to each other to find x:
# population_rod * (2 ** (hours_rod + x)) = population_sphere * (4 ** x)
# To solve for x, we can rearrange it:
# 2 * (2 ** (5 + x)) = 8 * (4 ** x)
# 2 * (2 ** (5 + x)) = 8 * (2 ** (2x))
# 2^(1 + 5 + x) = 2^3 * 2^(2x)
# 2^(6 + x) = 2^(3 + 2x)
# The exponents give us our equation:
# 6 + x = 3 + 2x
# 6 - 3 = 2x - x
# 3 = x
# Therefore, the time elapsed since Sphere was started growing is:
hours_sphere = 3  ### condition: 'hours_sphere': {'type': 'int', '<=': None, '>=': 0, 'science_constant': False, 'direct_from_question': False}
# Print the hours ago she started growing Sphere
