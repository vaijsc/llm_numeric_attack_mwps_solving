"What is the sum of the coordinates of the point you land upon if you connect the points (3, 0) and (9, 6) with a line segment and starting at (3, 0), you move $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the way along the segment?"
"Starting at (6, 0), you move $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the way along the segment connecting (6, 0) and (9, 6). What is the sum of the coordinates of the point you land upon?"
