"The volume of a cone is given by the formula $V = \\frac{1}{3}Bh$, where $B$ is the area of the base and $h$ is the height. The area of the base of a cone is 60 square units, and its height is 6.5 units. What is the number of cubic units in its volume?"
"The volume of a cone is given by the formula V = (1/3)Bh, where B is the area of the base and h is the height. The area of the base of a cone is 90 square units, and its height is 6.5 units. What is the number of cubic units in its volume?"
