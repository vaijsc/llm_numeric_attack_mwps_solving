"Josh and Mike live 13 miles apart. Yesterday Josh started to ride his bicycle toward Mike's house. A little later Mike started to ride his bicycle toward Josh's house. When they met, Josh had ridden for three times the length of time as Mike and at four-fifths of Mike's rate. How many miles had Mike ridden when they met?"
