### Instruction: Mark has a garden with flowers. He planted plants of three different colors in it. Ten of them are yellow, and there are 80% more of those in purple. There are only 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers. How many flowers does Mark have in his garden?
### Response: There are 80/100 * 10 = 8 more purple flowers than yellow flowers.\nSo in Mark's garden, there are 10 + 8 = 18 purple flowers.\nPurple and yellow flowers sum up to 10 + 18 = 28 flowers.\nThat means in Mark's garden there are 25/100 * 28 = 7 green flowers.\nSo in total Mark has 28 + 7 = 35 plants in his garden.\nThe answer is 35.
